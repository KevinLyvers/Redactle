parking, is, the, act, of, stopping, and, disengaging, a, vehicle, and, usually, leaving, it, unoccupied, parking, on, one, or, both, sides, of, a, road, is, often, permitted, though, sometimes, with, restrictions, some, buildings, have, parking, facilities, for, use, of, the, buildings, users, countries, and, local, governments, have, rules, for, design, and, use, of, parking, spaces, car, parking, is, essential, to, car, based, travel, cars, are, typically, stationary, around, 95, per, cent, of, the, time, the, availability, and, price, of, car, parking, may, support, car, dependency, significant, amounts, of, urban, land, are, devoted, to, car, parking, in, many, north, american, city, centers, half, or, more, of, all, land, is, devoted, to, car, parking, parking, facilities, can, be, divided, into, public, parking, and, private, parking, such, facilities, may, be, on, street, parking, located, on, the, street, or, off, street, parking, located, in, a, parking, lot, or, parking, garage, on, street, parking, can, come, in, the, form, of, curbside, or, central, parking, curbside, parking, may, be, parallel, angled, or, perpendicular, parking, parallel, parking, is, often, considered, a, complicated, maneuver, for, drivers, however, uses, the, least, road, width, on, street, parking, can, act, as, inexpensive, traffic, calming, by, reducing, the, effective, width, of, the, street, on, street, parking, may, be, restricted, for, a, number, of, reasons, restrictions, could, include, waiting, prohibitions, which, ban, parking, in, certain, areas, time, restrictions, requirements, to, pay, e, g, at, a, parking, meter, or, using, a, pay, by, phone, facility, or, a, permit, zone, restricting, parking, to, permit, holders, often, residents, only, parking, restrictions, may, be, applied, across, a, whole, zone, using, a, controlled, parking, zone, or, similar, on, street, parking, is, often, criticised, for, being, a, bad, use, of, high, value, public, space, especially, where, parking, is, free, in, some, cities, authorities, have, replaced, parking, spaces, with, parklets, parking, lots, or, car, parks, generally, come, in, either, a, structured, or, surface, regime, structured, regimes, are, buildings, in, which, vehicles, can, be, parked, including, multi, storey, parking, garages, underground, parking, or, a, hybrid, of, the, two, such, structures, may, be, incorporated, into, a, wider, structure, in, the, u, s, after, the, first, public, parking, garage, for, motor, vehicles, was, opened, in, boston, may, 24, 1898, livery, stables, in, urban, centers, began, to, be, converted, into, garages, in, cities, of, the, eastern, us, many, former, livery, stables, with, lifts, for, carriages, continue, to, operate, as, garages, today, surface, regimes, involve, using, a, clear, lot, to, provide, a, single, level, of, parking, this, may, be, a, stand, alone, car, park, or, located, around, a, building, there, is, a, wide, international, vocabulary, for, multi, storey, parking, garages, in, the, midwestern, united, states, they, are, known, as, parking, ramp, in, the, united, kingdom, they, are, known, as, multi, storey, car, parks, in, the, western, us, they, are, called, parking, structures, in, new, zealand, they, are, known, as, parking, buildings, in, canada, and, south, africa, they, are, known, as, parkades, fringe, parking, is, an, area, for, parking, usually, located, outside, the, central, business, district, and, most, often, used, by, suburban, residents, who, work, or, shop, downtown, park, and, ride, is, a, concept, of, parking, whereby, people, drive, or, cycle, to, a, car, park, away, from, their, destination, and, use, public, transport, or, another, form, of, transport, such, as, bicycle, hire, schemes, to, complete, their, journey, this, is, done, to, reduce, the, amount, of, traffic, congestion, and, the, need, for, parking, in, city, centres, and, to, connect, more, people, to, public, transport, networks, who, may, not, be, otherwise, parking, lots, specifically, for, bicycles, are, becoming, more, prevalent, in, many, countries, these, may, include, bicycle, parking, racks, and, locks, as, well, as, more, modern, technologies, for, security, and, convenience, for, instance, one, bicycle, parking, lot, in, tokyo, has, an, automated, parking, system, certain, parking, lots, or, garages, may, contain, parking, facilities, for, other, vehicles, such, as, bicycle, parking, underneath, utrecht, central, station, there, is, a, three, storey, underground, bicycle, park, which, can, store, 12, 656, bicycles, in, addition, to, basic, car, parking, variations, of, serviced, parking, types, exist, common, serviced, parking, types, are, parking, spaces, within, car, parks, may, be, variously, arranged, parking, is, one, of, the, most, important, intermediate, goods, in, the, modern, market, economy, early, economic, analysis, treated, parking, only, as, an, end, of, trip, cost, however, later, work, has, recognised, that, parking, is, a, major, use, of, land, in, any, urban, area, according, to, the, international, parking, institute, parking, is, a, 25, billion, industry, and, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, transportation, building, design, quality, of, life, and, environmental, issues, annual, parking, revenue, in, the, us, alone, is, 10, billion, in, urban, areas, car, parks, compete, with, each, other, and, curbside, parking, spaces, drivers, do, not, want, to, walk, far, from, where, they, have, parked, giving, car, parks, local, monopoly, power, urban, parking, spaces, can, have, a, high, value, where, the, price, of, land, is, high, the, prices, in, boston, for, parking, spaces, have, always, been, high, in, august, 2020, the, asking, price, ranged, just, under, us, 39, 000, in, the, west, end, to, almost, 250, 000, in, the, south, end, according, to, parkopedia, s, 2019, global, parking, index, the, cost, for, 2, hours, of, parking, in, usd, for, the, top, 25, global, cities, is, as, follows, in, the, graph, to, the, right, or, below, the, value, above, the, line, represents, the, out, of, pocket, cost, per, trip, per, person, for, each, mode, of, transportation, the, value, below, the, line, shows, subsidies, environmental, impact, social, and, indirect, costs, when, cities, charge, market, rates, for, on, street, parking, and, municipal, parking, garages, for, motor, vehicles, and, when, bridges, and, tunnels, are, tolled, for, these, modes, driving, becomes, less, competitive, in, terms, of, out, of, pocket, costs, compared, to, other, modes, of, transportation, when, municipal, motor, vehicle, parking, is, underpriced, and, roads, are, not, tolled, the, shortfall, in, tax, expenditures, by, drivers, through, fuel, tax, and, other, taxes, might, be, regarded, as, a, very, large, subsidy, for, automobile, use, much, greater, than, common, subsidies, for, the, maintenance, of, infrastructure, and, discounted, fares, for, public, transportation, the, average, response, in, parking, demand, to, a, change, in, price, parking, price, elasticity, is, 0, 52, for, commuting, and, 0, 62, for, non, commuting, trips, non, commuters, also, respond, to, parking, fees, by, changing, their, parking, duration, if, the, price, is, per, hour, donald, c, shoup, in, 2005, argued, in, his, book, the, high, cost, of, free, parking, against, the, large, scale, use, of, land, and, other, resources, in, urban, and, suburban, areas, for, motor, vehicle, parking, shoup, s, work, has, been, popularized, along, with, market, rate, parking, and, performance, parking, both, of, which, raise, and, lower, the, price, of, metered, street, parking, with, the, goal, of, reducing, cruising, for, parking, and, double, parking, without, overcharging, for, parking, performance, parking, or, variable, rate, parking, is, based, on, shoup, s, ideas, electronic, parking, meters, are, used, so, that, parking, spaces, in, desirable, locations, and, at, desirable, times, are, more, expensive, than, less, desirable, locations, other, variations, include, rising, rates, based, on, duration, of, parking, more, modern, ideas, use, sensors, and, networked, parking, meters, that, bid, up, or, down, the, price, of, parking, automatically, with, the, goal, of, keeping, 85, 90, of, the, spaces, in, use, at, any, given, time, to, ensure, perpetual, parking, availability, these, ideas, have, been, implemented, in, redwood, city, california, and, are, being, implemented, in, san, francisco, and, los, angeles, one, empirical, study, supports, performance, based, pricing, by, analyzing, the, block, level, price, elasticity, of, parking, demand, in, the, sfpark, context, the, study, suggests, that, block, level, elasticities, vary, so, widely, that, urban, planners, and, economists, cannot, accurately, predict, the, response, in, parking, demand, to, a, given, change, in, price, the, public, policy, implication, is, that, planners, should, utilize, observed, occupancy, rates, in, order, to, adjust, prices, so, that, target, occupancy, rates, are, achieved, effective, implementation, will, require, further, experimentation, with, and, assessment, of, the, t, tonnement, process, the, management, of, parking, as, a, land, use, is, an, aspect, of, urban, planning, municipal, parking, regulation, introduced, controls, for, parking, on, public, land, often, funded, through, parking, meters, however, with, the, growth, of, car, use, the, supply, of, on, street, parking, became, insufficient, to, meet, demand, city, centre, merchants, called, on, municipalities, to, subsidise, car, parking, in, the, city, centre, to, facilitate, competition, against, new, forms, of, car, centric, commercial, development, parking, is, a, heavy, land, use, the, total, land, area, of, parking, in, the, us, is, at, least, the, size, of, massachusetts, off, street, parking, can, be, a, temporary, usage, for, a, land, owner, to, extract, value, from, a, vacant, lot, during, the, winter, of, 2005, in, boston, the, practice, of, some, people, saving, convenient, roadway, for, themselves, became, controversial, at, that, time, many, boston, districts, had, an, informal, convention, that, if, a, person, shoveled, the, snow, out, of, a, roadspace, that, person, could, claim, ownership, of, that, space, with, a, marker, however, city, government, defied, that, custom, and, cleared, markers, out, of, spaces, in, congested, urban, areas, parking, of, motor, vehicles, is, time, consuming, and, often, expensive, urban, planners, who, are, in, a, position, to, override, market, forces, must, consider, whether, and, how, to, accommodate, or, demand, manage, potentially, large, numbers, of, motor, vehicles, in, small, geographic, areas, usually, the, authorities, set, minimum, or, more, rarely, maximum, numbers, of, motor, vehicle, parking, spaces, for, new, housing, and, commercial, developments, and, may, also, plan, their, location, and, distribution, to, influence, their, convenience, and, accessibility, the, costs, or, subsidies, of, such, parking, accommodations, can, become, a, heated, point, in, local, politics, for, example, in, 2006, the, san, francisco, board, of, supervisors, considered, a, controversial, zoning, plan, to, limit, the, number, of, motor, vehicle, parking, spaces, available, in, new, residential, developments, tradeable, parking, allowances, have, been, proposed, for, dense, residential, areas, to, reduce, inequity, and, increase, urban, livability, in, summary, each, resident, would, receive, an, annual, fractional, allowance, for, on, street, parking, to, park, on, the, street, one, must, assemble, a, whole, parking, allowance, by, purchasing, fractional, allowances, from, others, who, do, not, own, cars, german, municipalities, have, variegated, transport, cultures, and, policies, however, common, federal, laws, govern, the, use, of, street, space, and, the, rights, of, motorists, german, law, privileges, parked, cars, as, traffic, and, constrains, the, ability, of, municipal, governments, to, implement, diverse, parking, policies, german, legal, principles, determine, that, the, use, of, public, streets, is, for, traffic, including, car, parking, consequently, german, motorists, tend, to, assert, a, right, to, park, for, free, on, the, public, highway, in, japan, since, 1962, to, buy, a, car, one, is, required, to, obtain, a, garage, certificate, shako, shomeisho, from, their, local, prefecture, s, police, providing, proof, of, their, own, off, street, parking, space, that, they, either, buy, or, rent, that, is, not, located, more, than, 2, kilometers, from, their, place, of, residence, kei, cars, can, be, exempted, from, parking, space, requirement, in, some, sparsely, populated, areas, overnight, street, parking, is, not, allowed, in, some, jurisdictions, those, in, possession, of, the, proper, id, tags, or, license, plates, are, also, free, from, parking, violation, tickets, for, running, over, their, metered, time, or, parking, in, an, inappropriate, place, as, some, disabilities, may, prohibit, the, use, of, regular, spaces, illegally, parking, in, a, disabled, parking, space, or, fraudulent, use, of, another, person, s, permit, is, heavily, fined, in, south, korea, there, are, many, more, vehicles, than, there, are, parking, lots, in, the, country, so, parking, lots, are, sometimes, created, as, a, way, to, utilize, empty, spaces, where, people, are, playing, there, are, not, many, compact, cars, in, korea, so, the, government, is, providing, a, lot, of, support, for, them, and, the, parking, lot, discount, system, for, them, is, an, example, of, that, as, the, number, of, users, of, large, supermarket, chain, increased, in, korea, the, utilization, rate, of, the, traditional, market, sharply, decreased, accordingly, each, local, government, has, a, large, scale, parking, lots, near, the, traditional, market, and, provides, discounts, to, users, the, low, birth, rate, problem, in, korea, is, serious, and, there, is, a, lot, of, support, for, them, in, england, nhs, hospitals, are, permitted, to, charge, patients, staff, and, visitors, for, parking, at, the, hospital, this, has, been, criticised, for, adding, extra, costs, to, accessing, healthcare, in, scotland, and, wales, all, hospital, parking, charges, have, been, abolished, most, airports, provide, parking, for, patrons, parking, is, normally, split, into, short, stay, parking, intended, for, those, dropping, off, or, picking, up, passengers, and, long, stay, parking, intended, for, staff, and, passengers, who, choose, to, drive, to, the, airport, at, larger, airports, long, stay, parking, may, be, located, further, away, from, the, terminal, while, parking, at, the, terminal, will, be, more, expensive, some, airports, charge, more, for, parking, cars, than, for, parking, aircraft, airports, may, be, reluctant, to, discourage, passengers, from, arriving, at, the, airport, by, car, due, to, the, revenues, generated, at, uk, airports, it, is, rare, for, employees, to, pay, for, their, car, parking, generally, the, airports, authority, will, charge, for, staff, permits, but, these, permits, will, be, purchased, by, employers, and, the, cost, not, passed, on, to, staff, staff, are, generally, more, willing, to, park, at, a, site, away, from, the, airport, than, passengers, too, parking, generation, is, a, document, produced, by, the, institute, of, transportation, engineers, ite, that, assembles, a, vast, array, of, parking, demand, observations, predominately, from, the, united, states, it, summarizes, the, amount, of, parking, observed, with, various, land, uses, at, different, times, of, the, day, week, month, year, including, the, peak, parking, demand, while, it, has, been, assailed, by, some, planners, for, lack, of, data, in, urban, settings, it, stands, as, the, single, largest, accumulation, of, actual, parking, demand, data, related, to, land, use, anyone, can, submit, parking, demand, data, for, inclusion, the, report, is, updated, approximately, every, 5, to, 10, years, when, the, supply, of, kerbside, parking, in, a, particular, area, is, less, than, the, demand, for, parking, a, phenomenon, known, as, cruising, occurs, where, drivers, drive, on, streets, in, search, of, a, parking, space, it, can, also, occur, where, there, is, supply, of, kerbside, space, but, parking, restriction, or, payment, costs, discourage, drivers, from, parking, there, cruising, is, an, economic, decision, with, the, cost, of, parking, dominant, in, determining, cruising, behaviour, this, is, grounded, in, the, principle, that, drivers, will, only, cruise, if, the, cost, of, cruising, is, lower, than, the, savings, of, not, parking, in, available, chargeable, spaces, drivers, are, more, likely, to, cruise, if, on, street, parking, is, cheaper, than, off, street, parking, the, costs, of, fuel, are, cheap, the, driver, wishes, to, park, for, longer, the, driver, is, alone, in, the, car, and, the, driver, s, time, is, not, valuable, to, them, cruising, can, be, diminished, if, the, cost, of, on, street, parking, is, set, equal, to, the, cost, of, off, street, parking, automated, parking, guidance, systems, present, drivers, with, dynamic, information, on, parking, within, controlled, areas, like, parking, garages, and, parking, lots, the, systems, combine, traffic, monitoring, communication, processing, and, variable, message, sign, technologies, to, provide, the, service, mobile, apps, and, parking, booking, platforms, that, help, drivers, find, parking, take, different, approaches, have, emerged, some, connected, cars, have, mobile, apps, associated, with, the, in, car, system, that, can, locate, the, car, or, indicate, the, last, place, it, was, parked, cars, with, internavi, communicate, to, each, other, indicating, recently, vacated, spots, san, francisco, uses, a, system, called, sfpark, which, has, sensors, embedded, in, the, roadway, it, allows, drivers, to, find, parking, via, mobile, app, website, or, sms, and, includes, smart, parking, meters, and, garages, that, use, variable, pricing, based, on, time, and, location, to, keep, approximately, 15, of, parking, spaces, open, some, south, boston, spots, also, have, sensors, so, users, of, an, app, called, parker, can, find, vacancies, ford, motor, company, is, developing, a, system, called, parking, spotter, which, allows, vehicles, to, upload, parking, spot, information, into, the, cloud, for, other, drivers, to, access, parking, guidance, and, information, system, provides, information, about, the, availability, of, parking, spaces, within, a, controlled, area, the, systems, may, include, vehicle, detection, sensors, that, can, count, the, number, of, available, spaces, and, display, the, information, on, various, signs, there, may, be, indicator, lights, that, can, lead, drivers, to, an, exact, available, spot, an, amusing, alliterative, slang, term, for, finding, an, ideal, parking, spot, directly, in, front, of, ones, destination, is, doris, day, parking, named, for, the, american, singer, and, actor, who, in, numerous, romantic, comedy, films, was, shown, to, immediately, drive, into, the, perfect, spot, time, after, time, statistically, the, optimal, strategy, is, to, drive, past, the, first, empty, spot, and, park, in, the, next, available, spot
