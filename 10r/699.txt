the, trans, siberian, railway, historically, known, as, the, great, siberian, route, and, often, shortened, to, transsib, is, a, large, railway, system, that, connects, european, russia, to, the, russian, far, east, spanning, a, length, of, over, 9, 289, kilometers, 5, 772, miles, it, is, the, longest, railway, line, in, the, world, it, runs, from, the, city, of, moscow, in, the, west, to, the, city, of, vladivostok, in, the, east, during, the, period, of, the, russian, empire, government, ministers, personally, appointed, by, alexander, iii, and, his, son, nicholas, ii, supervised, the, building, of, the, railway, network, between, 1891, and, 1916, even, before, its, completion, the, line, attracted, travelers, who, documented, their, experiences, since, 1916, the, trans, siberian, railway, has, directly, connected, moscow, with, vladivostok, as, of, 2021, expansion, projects, remain, underway, with, connections, being, built, to, russia, s, neighbors, mongolia, china, and, north, korea, additionally, there, have, been, proposals, and, talks, to, expand, the, network, to, tokyo, japan, with, new, bridges, or, tunnels, that, would, connect, the, mainland, railway, via, the, russian, island, of, sakhalin, and, the, japanese, island, of, hokkaido, the, railway, is, often, associated, with, the, main, transcontinental, russian, line, that, connects, many, large, and, small, cities, of, the, european, and, asian, parts, of, russia, at, a, moscow, vladivostok, track, length, of, 9, 289, kilometers, 5, 772, miles, it, spans, a, record, eight, time, zones, taking, eight, days, to, complete, the, journey, it, was, the, third, longest, single, continuous, service, in, the, world, after, the, moscow, pyongyang, service, 10, 267, kilometers, 6, 380, mi, and, the, former, kyiv, kiev, vladivostok, service, 11, 085, kilometers, 6, 888, mi, both, of, which, also, follow, the, trans, siberian, for, much, of, their, routes, the, main, route, begins, in, moscow, at, yaroslavsky, vokzal, runs, through, yaroslavl, or, chelyabinsk, omsk, novosibirsk, krasnoyarsk, irkutsk, ulan, ude, chita, and, khabarovsk, to, vladivostok, via, southern, siberia, a, second, primary, route, is, the, trans, manchurian, which, coincides, with, the, trans, siberian, east, of, chita, as, far, as, tarskaya, a, stop, 12, km, 7, mi, east, of, karymskoye, in, chita, oblast, about, 1, 000, km, 621, mi, east, of, lake, baikal, from, tarskaya, the, trans, manchurian, heads, southeast, via, harbin, harbin, manzhouli, railway, and, mudanjiang, harbin, suifenhe, railway, in, china, s, northeastern, provinces, from, where, a, connection, to, beijing, is, used, by, one, of, the, moscow, beijing, trains, joining, the, main, route, in, ussuriysk, just, north, of, vladivostok, the, third, primary, route, is, the, trans, mongolian, railway, which, coincides, with, the, trans, siberian, as, far, as, ulan, ude, on, lake, baikal, s, eastern, shore, from, ulan, ude, the, trans, mongolian, heads, south, to, ulaanbaatar, before, making, its, way, southeast, to, beijing, in, 1991, a, fourth, route, running, further, to, the, north, was, finally, completed, after, more, than, five, decades, of, sporadic, work, known, as, the, baikal, amur, mainline, bam, this, recent, extension, departs, from, the, trans, siberian, line, at, taishet, several, hundred, miles, west, of, lake, baikal, and, passes, the, lake, at, its, northernmost, extremity, it, crosses, the, amur, river, at, komsomolsk, na, amure, north, of, khabarovsk, and, reaches, the, tatar, strait, at, sovetskaya, gavan, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, development, of, siberia, was, hampered, by, poor, transport, links, within, the, region, and, with, the, rest, of, the, country, aside, from, the, great, siberian, route, roads, suitable, for, wheeled, transport, were, rare, for, about, five, months, of, the, year, rivers, were, the, main, means, of, transport, during, winter, cargo, and, passengers, traveled, by, horse, drawn, sledges, over, the, winter, roads, many, of, which, were, the, same, rivers, but, frozen, the, first, steamboat, on, the, river, ob, nikita, myasnikov, s, osnova, was, launched, in, 1844, however, early, innovation, had, proven, to, be, difficult, and, it, was, not, until, 1857, that, steamboat, shipping, had, begun, major, development, on, the, ob, system, steamboats, began, operation, on, the, yenisei, in, 1863, and, on, the, lena, and, amur, in, the, 1870s, while, the, comparative, flatness, of, western, siberia, was, served, by, good, river, systems, the, major, river, systems, ob, irtysh, tobol, chulym, of, eastern, siberia, had, difficulties, the, yenisei, the, upper, course, of, the, angara, river, below, bratsk, which, was, not, easily, navigable, because, of, the, rapids, and, the, lena, were, mostly, navigable, only, in, the, north, south, direction, making, west, east, transportation, difficult, an, attempt, to, partially, remedy, the, situation, by, building, the, ob, yenisei, canal, had, not, yielded, great, success, these, issues, in, the, region, created, the, need, for, a, railway, to, be, constructed, the, first, railway, projects, in, siberia, emerged, after, the, completion, of, the, saint, petersburg, moscow, railway, in, 1851, one, of, the, first, was, the, irkutsk, chita, project, proposed, by, the, american, entrepreneur, perry, collins, and, supported, by, transport, minister, constantine, possiet, with, a, view, toward, connecting, moscow, to, the, amur, river, and, consequently, the, pacific, ocean, siberia, s, governor, nikolay, muravyov, amursky, was, anxious, to, advance, russian, colonization, of, the, now, russian, far, east, but, his, plans, were, unfeasible, due, to, colonists, importing, grain, and, food, from, china, and, korea, it, was, on, muravyov, s, initiative, that, surveys, for, a, railway, in, the, khabarovsk, region, were, conducted, before, 1880, the, central, government, had, virtually, ignored, these, projects, due, to, weaknesses, in, siberian, enterprises, an, inefficient, bureaucracy, and, financial, risk, by, 1880, there, was, a, large, number, of, rejected, and, upcoming, applications, for, permission, to, construct, railways, in, order, to, connect, siberia, with, the, pacific, but, not, eastern, russia, this, worried, the, government, and, made, connecting, siberia, with, central, russia, a, pressing, concern, the, design, process, lasted, 10, years, along, with, the, actual, route, constructed, alternative, projects, were, proposed, the, line, was, divided, into, seven, sections, most, or, all, of, which, was, simultaneously, worked, on, by, 62, 000, workers, with, financial, support, provided, by, leading, european, financier, baron, henri, hottinguer, of, the, parisian, bankers, hottinger, cie, the, total, cost, estimated, at, 35, million, was, raised, with, the, first, section, chelyabinsk, to, the, river, ob, and, finished, at, a, cost, of, 900, 000, lower, than, anticipated, railwaymen, argued, against, suggestions, to, save, funds, such, as, installing, ferryboats, instead, of, bridges, over, the, rivers, until, traffic, increased, unlike, the, rejected, private, projects, that, intended, to, connect, the, existing, cities, that, required, transport, the, trans, siberian, did, not, have, such, a, priority, thus, to, save, money, and, avoid, clashes, with, land, owners, it, was, decided, to, lay, the, railway, outside, the, existing, cities, however, due, to, the, swampy, banks, of, the, ob, river, near, tomsk, the, largest, settlement, at, the, time, the, idea, to, construct, a, bridge, was, rejected, the, railway, was, laid, 70, km, 43, mi, to, the, south, instead, crossing, the, ob, at, novonikolaevsk, later, renamed, novosibirsk, a, dead, end, branch, line, connected, with, tomsk, depriving, the, city, of, the, prospective, transit, railway, traffic, and, trade, on, 9, march, 1891, the, russian, government, issued, an, imperial, rescript, in, which, it, announced, its, intention, to, construct, a, railway, across, siberia, tsarevich, nicholas, later, tsar, nicholas, ii, inaugurated, the, construction, of, the, railway, in, vladivostok, on, 19, may, that, year, lake, baikal, is, more, than, 640, kilometers, 400, miles, long, and, more, than, 1, 600, meters, 5, 200, feet, deep, until, the, circum, baikal, railway, was, built, the, line, ended, on, either, side, of, the, lake, the, ice, breaking, train, ferry, ss, baikal, built, in, 1897, and, smaller, ferry, ss, angara, built, in, about, 1900, made, the, four, hour, crossing, to, link, the, two, railheads, the, russian, admiral, and, explorer, stepan, makarov, 1849, 1904, designed, baikal, and, angara, but, they, were, built, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, by, armstrong, whitworth, they, were, knock, down, vessels, that, is, each, ship, was, bolted, together, in, the, united, kingdom, every, part, of, the, ship, was, marked, with, a, number, the, ship, was, disassembled, into, many, hundreds, of, parts, and, transported, in, kit, form, to, listvyanka, where, a, shipyard, was, built, especially, to, reassemble, them, their, boilers, engines, and, some, other, components, were, built, in, saint, petersburg, and, transported, to, listvyanka, to, be, installed, baikal, had, 15, boilers, four, funnels, and, was, 64, meters, 210, ft, long, it, could, carry, 24, railway, coaches, and, one, locomotive, on, the, middle, deck, angara, was, smaller, with, two, funnels, completion, of, the, circum, baikal, railway, in, 1904, bypassed, the, ferries, but, from, time, to, time, the, circum, baikal, railway, suffered, from, derailments, or, rockfalls, so, both, ships, were, held, in, reserve, until, 1916, baikal, was, burnt, out, and, destroyed, in, the, russian, civil, war, but, angara, survives, it, has, been, restored, and, is, permanently, moored, at, irkutsk, where, it, serves, as, an, office, and, a, museum, in, winter, sleighs, were, used, to, move, passengers, and, cargo, from, one, side, of, the, lake, to, the, other, until, the, completion, of, the, lake, baikal, spur, along, the, southern, edge, of, the, lake, with, the, amur, river, line, north, of, the, chinese, border, being, completed, in, 1916, there, was, a, continuous, railway, from, petrograd, to, vladivostok, that, to, this, day, is, the, world, s, second, longest, railway, line, electrification, of, the, line, begun, in, 1929, and, completed, in, 2002, allowed, a, doubling, of, train, weights, to, 6, 000, metric, tons, 5, 900, long, tons, 6, 600, short, tons, there, were, expectations, upon, electrification, that, it, would, increase, rail, traffic, on, the, line, by, 40, percent, the, entire, length, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, was, double, track, by, 1939, siberian, agriculture, began, to, send, cheap, grain, westwards, beginning, around, 1869, agriculture, in, central, russia, was, still, under, economic, pressure, after, the, end, of, serfdom, which, was, formally, abolished, in, 1861, to, defend, the, central, territory, and, prevent, possible, social, destabilization, the, tsarist, government, introduced, the, chelyabinsk, tariff, break, in, 1896, a, tariff, barrier, for, grain, passing, through, chelyabinsk, and, a, similar, barrier, in, manchuria, this, measure, changed, the, nature, of, export, mills, emerged, to, produce, bread, from, grain, in, altai, krai, novosibirsk, and, tomsk, and, many, farms, switched, to, corn, maize, production, the, railway, immediately, filled, to, capacity, with, local, traffic, mostly, wheat, from, 1896, until, 1913, siberia, exported, on, average, 501, 932, metric, tons, 494, 005, long, tons, 553, 285, short, tons, 30, 643, 000, pood, of, grain, and, flour, annually, during, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, military, traffic, to, the, east, disrupted, the, flow, of, civil, freight, the, trans, siberian, railway, brought, with, it, millions, of, peasant, migrants, from, the, western, regions, of, russia, and, ukraine, between, 1906, and, 1914, the, peak, migration, years, about, 4, million, peasants, arrived, in, siberia, historian, christian, wolmar, argues, that, the, railroad, was, a, failure, because, it, was, built, for, narrow, political, reasons, with, poor, supervision, and, planning, the, costs, were, vastly, exaggerated, to, enrich, greedy, bureaucrats, the, planners, hoped, it, would, stimulate, settlement, but, the, siberian, lands, were, too, infertile, and, cold, and, distant, there, was, little, settlement, beyond, 30, miles, from, the, line, the, fragile, system, could, not, handle, the, heavy, traffic, demanded, in, wartime, so, the, japanese, in, 1904, knew, they, were, safe, in, their, war, with, russia, wolmar, concludes, the, railway, which, was, single, track, throughout, with, the, occasional, passing, loop, had, unsurprisingly, been, built, to, a, deficient, standard, in, virtually, every, way, the, permanent, way, was, flimsy, with, lightweight, rails, that, broke, easily, insufficient, ballast, and, railroad, ties, often, carved, from, green, wood, that, rotted, in, the, first, year, of, use, the, small, bridges, were, made, of, soft, pine, and, rotted, easily, the, embankments, were, too, shallow, and, narrow, often, just, 10, ft, wide, instead, of, the, 16, ft, prescribed, in, the, design, and, easily, washed, away, there, were, vicious, gradients, and, narrow, curves, that, wore, out, the, fringe, flanges, on, the, wheels, of, the, rolling, stock, after, as, little, as, six, weeks, use, in, the, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 1905, the, strategic, importance, and, limitations, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, contributed, to, russia, s, defeat, in, the, war, as, the, line, was, single, track, transit, was, slower, as, trains, had, to, wait, in, crossing, sidings, for, opposing, trains, to, cross, this, limited, the, capacity, of, the, line, and, increased, transit, times, a, troop, train, or, a, train, carrying, injured, personnel, traveling, from, east, to, west, would, delay, the, arrival, of, troops, or, supplies, and, ammunition, in, a, train, traveling, from, west, to, east, the, supply, difficulties, meant, the, russian, forces, had, limited, troops, and, supplies, while, japanese, forces, with, shorter, lines, of, communication, were, able, to, attack, and, advance, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, the, railway, served, as, the, vital, line, of, communication, for, the, czechoslovak, legion, and, the, allied, armies, that, landed, troops, at, vladivostok, during, the, siberian, intervention, of, the, russian, civil, war, these, forces, supported, the, white, russian, government, of, admiral, alexander, kolchak, based, in, omsk, and, white, russian, soldiers, fighting, the, bolsheviks, on, the, ural, front, the, intervention, was, weakened, and, ultimately, defeated, by, partisan, fighters, who, blew, up, bridges, and, sections, of, track, particularly, in, the, volatile, region, between, krasnoyarsk, and, chita, there, was, traveling, the, leader, of, legions, politician, milan, rastislav, stefanik, from, moscow, to, vladivostok, in, march, and, august, 1918, on, his, journey, to, japan, and, united, states, of, america, the, trans, siberian, railway, also, played, a, very, direct, role, during, parts, of, russia, s, history, with, the, czechoslovak, legion, using, heavily, armed, and, armored, trains, to, control, large, amounts, of, the, railway, and, of, russia, itself, during, the, russian, civil, war, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, as, one, of, the, few, fighting, forces, left, in, the, aftermath, of, the, imperial, collapse, and, before, the, red, army, took, control, the, czechs, and, slovaks, were, able, to, use, their, organization, and, the, resources, of, the, railway, to, establish, a, temporary, zone, of, control, before, eventually, continuing, onwards, towards, vladivostok, from, where, they, emigrated, back, to, czechoslovakia, during, world, war, ii, the, trans, siberian, railway, played, an, important, role, in, the, supply, of, the, powers, fighting, in, europe, in, 1939, 1941, it, was, a, source, of, rubber, for, germany, thanks, to, the, ussr, germany, pact, while, germany, s, merchant, shipping, was, shut, down, the, trans, siberian, railway, along, with, its, trans, manchurian, branch, served, as, the, essential, link, between, germany, and, japan, especially, for, rubber, by, march, 1941, 300, metric, tons, 300, long, tons, 330, short, tons, of, this, material, would, on, average, traverse, the, trans, siberian, railway, every, day, on, its, way, to, germany, at, the, same, time, a, number, of, jews, and, anti, nazis, used, the, trans, siberian, railway, to, escape, europe, including, the, mathematician, kurt, g, del, and, betty, ehrlich, l, wenstein, mother, of, british, actor, director, and, producer, heinz, bernard, several, thousand, jewish, refugees, were, able, to, make, this, trip, thanks, to, the, cura, ao, visas, issued, by, the, dutch, consul, jan, zwartendijk, and, the, japanese, visas, issued, by, the, japanese, consul, chiune, sugihara, in, kaunas, lithuania, typically, they, took, the, tsr, to, vladivostok, then, by, ship, to, us, until, june, 1941, pro, nazi, ethnic, germans, from, the, americas, used, the, tsr, to, go, to, germany, the, situation, reversed, after, 22, june, 1941, by, invading, the, soviet, union, germany, cut, off, its, only, reliable, trade, route, to, japan, instead, it, had, to, use, fast, merchant, ships, and, later, large, oceanic, submarines, to, evade, the, allied, blockade, on, the, other, hand, the, ussr, received, lend, lease, supplies, from, the, us, even, after, japan, went, to, war, with, the, us, despite, german, complaints, japan, usually, allowed, soviet, ships, to, sail, between, the, us, and, vladivostok, unmolested, as, a, result, the, pacific, route, via, northern, pacific, ocean, and, the, tsr, became, the, safest, connection, between, the, us, and, the, ussr, accordingly, it, accounted, for, as, much, freight, as, the, north, atlantic, arctic, and, iranian, routes, combined, though, cargoes, were, limited, to, raw, materials, and, non, military, goods, from, 1941, to, 1942, the, tsr, also, played, an, important, role, in, relocating, soviet, industries, from, european, russia, to, siberia, in, the, face, of, the, german, invasion, the, tsr, also, transported, soviet, troops, west, from, the, far, east, to, take, part, in, the, soviet, counter, offensive, in, december, 1941, in, 1944, 45, the, tsr, was, used, to, prepare, for, the, soviet, japanese, war, of, august, 1945, see, pacific, route, when, an, anglo, american, delegation, visited, moscow, in, october, 1944, to, discuss, the, soviet, union, joining, the, war, against, japan, alanbrooke, was, told, by, general, antonov, and, stalin, himself, that, the, line, capacity, was, 36, pairs, of, trains, per, day, but, only, 26, could, be, counted, on, for, military, traffic, see, pacific, route, the, capacity, of, each, train, was, from, 600, to, 700, tons, although, the, japanese, estimated, that, an, attack, was, not, likely, before, spring, 1946, stavka, had, planned, for, a, mid, august, 1945, offensive, and, had, concealed, the, buildup, of, a, force, of, 90, divisions, many, had, crossed, siberia, in, their, vehicles, to, avoid, straining, the, rail, link, a, trainload, of, containers, can, be, taken, from, beijing, to, hamburg, via, the, trans, mongolian, and, trans, siberian, lines, in, as, little, as, 15, days, but, typical, cargo, transit, times, are, usually, significantly, longer, and, typical, cargo, transit, time, from, japan, to, major, destinations, in, european, russia, was, reported, as, around, 25, days, according, to, a, 2009, report, the, best, travel, times, for, cargo, block, trains, from, russia, s, pacific, ports, to, the, western, border, of, russia, or, perhaps, of, belarus, were, around, 12, days, with, trains, making, around, 900, km, 559, mi, per, day, at, a, maximum, operating, speed, of, 80, km, h, 50, mph, in, early, 2009, however, russian, railways, announced, an, ambitious, trans, siberian, in, seven, days, plan, according, to, this, plan, 11, billion, will, be, invested, over, the, next, five, years, to, make, it, possible, for, goods, traffic, to, cover, the, same, 9, 000, km, 5, 592, mi, distance, in, just, seven, days, the, plan, will, involve, increasing, the, cargo, trains, speed, to, 90, km, h, 56, mph, in, 2010, 2012, and, at, least, on, some, sections, to, 100, km, h, 62, mph, by, 2015, at, these, speeds, goods, trains, will, be, able, to, cover, 1, 500, km, 932, mi, per, day, on, january, 11, 2008, china, mongolia, russia, belarus, poland, and, germany, agreed, to, collaborate, on, a, cargo, train, service, between, beijing, and, hamburg, the, railway, can, typically, deliver, containers, in, 1, 3, to, 1, 2, of, the, time, of, a, sea, voyage, and, in, late, 2009, announced, a, 20, reduction, in, its, container, shipping, rates, with, its, 2009, rate, schedule, the, trans, siberian, railway, will, transport, a, forty, foot, container, to, poland, from, yokohama, for, 2, 820, or, from, busan, for, 2, 154, a, commonly, used, main, line, route, is, as, follows, distances, and, travel, times, are, from, the, schedule, of, train, no, 002m, moscow, vladivostok, there, are, many, alternative, routings, between, moscow, and, siberia, for, example, depending, on, the, route, taken, the, distances, from, moscow, to, the, same, station, in, siberia, may, differ, by, several, tens, of, km, a, few, dozen, miles, the, trans, manchurian, line, as, e, g, used, by, train, no, 020, moscow, beijing, follows, the, same, route, as, the, trans, siberian, between, moscow, and, chita, and, then, follows, this, route, to, china, the, express, train, no, 020, travel, time, from, moscow, to, beijing, is, just, over, six, days, there, is, no, direct, passenger, service, along, the, entire, original, trans, manchurian, route, i, e, from, moscow, or, anywhere, in, russia, west, of, manchuria, to, vladivostok, via, harbin, due, to, the, obvious, administrative, and, technical, gauge, break, inconveniences, of, crossing, the, border, twice, assuming, sufficient, patience, and, possession, of, appropriate, visas, however, it, is, still, possible, to, travel, all, the, way, along, the, original, route, with, a, few, stopovers, e, g, in, harbin, grodekovo, and, ussuriysk, such, an, itinerary, would, pass, through, the, following, points, from, harbin, east, the, trans, mongolian, line, follows, the, same, route, as, the, trans, siberian, between, moscow, and, ulan, ude, and, then, follows, this, route, to, mongolia, and, china, the, highest, point, of, trans, siberian, railroad, is, at, yablonovy, pass, at, an, altitude, of, 1070m, situated, in, the, yablonoi, mountains, in, transbaikal, mainly, in, zabaykalsky, krai, siberia, russia, the, trans, siberian, railroad, passes, the, mountains, at, chita, and, runs, parallel, to, the, range, before, going, through, a, tunnel, to, bypass, the, heights
