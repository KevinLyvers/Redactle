an, optical, fiber, or, optical, fibre, is, a, flexible, glass, or, plastic, fiber, that, can, transmit, light, from, one, end, to, the, other, such, fibers, find, wide, usage, in, fiber, optic, communications, where, they, permit, transmission, over, longer, distances, and, at, higher, bandwidths, data, transfer, rates, than, electrical, cables, fibers, are, used, instead, of, metal, wires, because, signals, travel, along, them, with, less, loss, and, are, immune, to, electromagnetic, interference, fibers, are, also, used, for, illumination, and, imaging, and, are, often, wrapped, in, bundles, so, they, may, be, used, to, carry, light, into, or, images, out, of, confined, spaces, as, in, the, case, of, a, fiberscope, specially, designed, fibers, are, also, used, for, a, variety, of, other, applications, such, as, fiber, optic, sensors, and, fiber, lasers, glass, optical, fibers, are, typically, made, by, drawing, while, plastic, fibers, can, be, made, either, by, drawing, or, by, extrusion, optical, fibers, typically, include, a, core, surrounded, by, a, transparent, cladding, material, with, a, lower, index, of, refraction, light, is, kept, in, the, core, by, the, phenomenon, of, total, internal, reflection, which, causes, the, fiber, to, act, as, a, waveguide, fibers, that, support, many, propagation, paths, or, transverse, modes, are, called, multi, mode, fibers, while, those, that, support, a, single, mode, are, called, single, mode, fibers, smf, multi, mode, fibers, generally, have, a, wider, core, diameter, and, are, used, for, short, distance, communication, links, and, for, applications, where, high, power, must, be, transmitted, single, mode, fibers, are, used, for, most, communication, links, longer, than, 1, 050, meters, 3, 440, ft, being, able, to, join, optical, fibers, with, low, loss, is, important, in, fiber, optic, communication, this, is, more, complex, than, joining, electrical, wire, or, cable, and, involves, careful, cleaving, of, the, fibers, precise, alignment, of, the, fiber, cores, and, the, coupling, of, these, aligned, cores, for, applications, that, demand, a, permanent, connection, a, fusion, splice, is, common, in, this, technique, an, electric, arc, is, used, to, melt, the, ends, of, the, fibers, together, another, common, technique, is, a, mechanical, splice, where, the, ends, of, the, fibers, are, held, in, contact, by, mechanical, force, temporary, or, semi, permanent, connections, are, made, by, means, of, specialized, optical, fiber, connectors, the, field, of, applied, science, and, engineering, concerned, with, the, design, and, application, of, optical, fibers, is, known, as, fiber, optics, the, term, was, coined, by, indian, american, physicist, narinder, singh, kapany, daniel, colladon, and, jacques, babinet, first, demonstrated, the, guiding, of, light, by, refraction, the, principle, that, makes, fiber, optics, possible, in, paris, in, the, early, 1840s, john, tyndall, included, a, demonstration, of, it, in, his, public, lectures, in, london, 12, years, later, tyndall, also, wrote, about, the, property, of, total, internal, reflection, in, an, introductory, book, about, the, nature, of, light, in, 1870, when, the, light, passes, from, air, into, water, the, refracted, ray, is, bent, towards, the, perpendicular, when, the, ray, passes, from, water, to, air, it, is, bent, from, the, perpendicular, if, the, angle, which, the, ray, in, water, encloses, with, the, perpendicular, to, the, surface, be, greater, than, 48, degrees, the, ray, will, not, quit, the, water, at, all, it, will, be, totally, reflected, at, the, surface, the, angle, which, marks, the, limit, where, total, reflection, begins, is, called, the, limiting, angle, of, the, medium, for, water, this, angle, is, 48, 27, for, flint, glass, it, is, 38, 41, while, for, a, diamond, it, is, 23, 42, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, team, of, viennese, doctors, guided, light, through, bent, glass, rods, to, illuminate, body, cavities, practical, applications, such, as, close, internal, illumination, during, dentistry, followed, early, in, the, twentieth, century, image, transmission, through, tubes, was, demonstrated, independently, by, the, radio, experimenter, clarence, hansell, and, the, television, pioneer, john, logie, baird, in, the, 1920s, in, the, 1930s, heinrich, lamm, showed, that, one, could, transmit, images, through, a, bundle, of, unclad, optical, fibers, and, used, it, for, internal, medical, examinations, but, his, work, was, largely, forgotten, in, 1953, dutch, scientist, bram, van, heel, first, demonstrated, image, transmission, through, bundles, of, optical, fibers, with, a, transparent, cladding, later, that, same, year, harold, hopkins, and, narinder, singh, kapany, at, imperial, college, in, london, succeeded, in, making, image, transmitting, bundles, with, over, 10, 000, fibers, and, subsequently, achieved, image, transmission, through, a, 75, cm, long, bundle, which, combined, several, thousand, fibers, the, first, practical, fiber, optic, semi, flexible, gastroscope, was, patented, by, basil, hirschowitz, c, wilbur, peters, and, lawrence, e, curtiss, researchers, at, the, university, of, michigan, in, 1956, in, the, process, of, developing, the, gastroscope, curtiss, produced, the, first, glass, clad, fibers, previous, optical, fibers, had, relied, on, air, or, impractical, oils, and, waxes, as, the, low, index, cladding, material, kapany, coined, the, term, fiber, optics, after, writing, a, 1960, article, in, scientific, american, that, introduced, the, topic, to, a, wide, audience, he, subsequently, wrote, the, first, book, about, the, new, field, the, first, working, fiber, optic, data, transmission, system, was, demonstrated, by, german, physicist, manfred, b, rner, at, telefunken, research, labs, in, ulm, in, 1965, followed, by, the, first, patent, application, for, this, technology, in, 1966, in, 1968, nasa, used, fiber, optics, in, the, television, cameras, that, were, sent, to, the, moon, at, the, time, the, use, in, the, cameras, was, classified, confidential, and, employees, handling, the, cameras, had, to, be, supervised, by, someone, with, an, appropriate, security, clearance, charles, k, kao, and, george, a, hockham, of, the, british, company, standard, telephones, and, cables, stc, were, the, first, to, promote, the, idea, that, the, attenuation, in, optical, fibers, could, be, reduced, below, 20, decibels, per, kilometer, db, km, making, fibers, a, practical, communication, medium, in, 1965, they, proposed, that, the, attenuation, in, fibers, available, at, the, time, was, caused, by, impurities, that, could, be, removed, rather, than, by, fundamental, physical, effects, such, as, scattering, they, correctly, and, systematically, theorized, the, light, loss, properties, for, optical, fiber, and, pointed, out, the, right, material, to, use, for, such, fibers, silica, glass, with, high, purity, this, discovery, earned, kao, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2009, the, crucial, attenuation, limit, of, 20, db, km, was, first, achieved, in, 1970, by, researchers, robert, d, maurer, donald, keck, peter, c, schultz, and, frank, zimar, working, for, american, glass, maker, corning, glass, works, they, demonstrated, a, fiber, with, 17, db, km, attenuation, by, doping, silica, glass, with, titanium, a, few, years, later, they, produced, a, fiber, with, only, 4, db, km, attenuation, using, germanium, dioxide, as, the, core, dopant, in, 1981, general, electric, produced, fused, quartz, ingots, that, could, be, drawn, into, strands, 25, miles, 40, km, long, initially, high, quality, optical, fibers, could, only, be, manufactured, at, 2, meters, per, second, chemical, engineer, thomas, mensah, joined, corning, in, 1983, and, increased, the, speed, of, manufacture, to, over, 50, meters, per, second, making, optical, fiber, cables, cheaper, than, traditional, copper, ones, these, innovations, ushered, in, the, era, of, optical, fiber, telecommunication, the, italian, research, center, cselt, worked, with, corning, to, develop, practical, optical, fiber, cables, resulting, in, the, first, metropolitan, fiber, optic, cable, being, deployed, in, turin, in, 1977, cselt, also, developed, an, early, technique, for, splicing, optical, fibers, called, springroove, attenuation, in, modern, optical, cables, is, far, less, than, in, electrical, copper, cables, leading, to, long, haul, fiber, connections, with, repeater, distances, of, 70, 150, kilometers, 43, 93, mi, two, teams, led, by, david, n, payne, of, the, university, of, southampton, and, emmanuel, desurvire, at, bell, labs, developed, the, erbium, doped, fiber, amplifier, which, reduced, the, cost, of, long, distance, fiber, systems, by, reducing, or, eliminating, optical, electrical, optical, repeaters, in, 1986, and, 1987, respectively, the, emerging, field, of, photonic, crystals, led, to, the, development, in, 1991, of, photonic, crystal, fiber, which, guides, light, by, diffraction, from, a, periodic, structure, rather, than, by, total, internal, reflection, the, first, photonic, crystal, fibers, became, commercially, available, in, 2000, photonic, crystal, fibers, can, carry, higher, power, than, conventional, fibers, and, their, wavelength, dependent, properties, can, be, manipulated, to, improve, performance, these, fibers, can, have, hollow, cores, optical, fiber, is, used, as, a, medium, for, telecommunication, and, computer, networking, because, it, is, flexible, and, can, be, bundled, as, cables, it, is, especially, advantageous, for, long, distance, communications, because, infrared, light, propagates, through, the, fiber, with, much, lower, attenuation, compared, to, electricity, in, electrical, cables, this, allows, long, distances, to, be, spanned, with, few, repeaters, 10, or, 40, gbit, s, is, typical, in, deployed, systems, through, the, use, of, wavelength, division, multiplexing, wdm, each, fiber, can, carry, many, independent, channels, each, using, a, different, wavelength, of, light, the, net, data, rate, data, rate, without, overhead, bytes, per, fiber, is, the, per, channel, data, rate, reduced, by, the, forward, error, correction, fec, overhead, multiplied, by, the, number, of, channels, usually, up, to, 80, in, commercial, dense, wdm, systems, as, of, 2008, for, short, distance, applications, such, as, a, network, in, an, office, building, see, fiber, to, the, office, fiber, optic, cabling, can, save, space, in, cable, ducts, this, is, because, a, single, fiber, can, carry, much, more, data, than, electrical, cables, such, as, standard, category, 5, cable, which, typically, runs, at, 100, mbit, s, or, 1, gbit, s, speeds, fibers, are, often, also, used, for, short, distance, connections, between, devices, for, example, most, high, definition, televisions, offer, a, digital, audio, optical, connection, this, allows, the, streaming, of, audio, over, light, using, the, s, pdif, protocol, over, an, optical, toslink, connection, fibers, have, many, uses, in, remote, sensing, in, some, applications, the, fiber, itself, is, the, sensor, the, fibers, channel, optical, light, to, a, processing, device, that, analyzes, changes, in, the, light, s, characteristics, in, other, cases, fiber, is, used, to, connect, a, sensor, to, a, measurement, system, optical, fibers, can, be, used, as, sensors, to, measure, strain, temperature, pressure, and, other, quantities, by, modifying, a, fiber, so, that, the, property, being, measured, modulates, the, intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or, transit, time, of, light, in, the, fiber, sensors, that, vary, the, intensity, of, light, are, the, simplest, since, only, a, simple, source, and, detector, are, required, a, particularly, useful, feature, of, such, fiber, optic, sensors, is, that, they, can, if, required, provide, distributed, sensing, over, distances, of, up, to, one, meter, distributed, acoustic, sensing, is, one, example, of, this, in, contrast, highly, localized, measurements, can, be, provided, by, integrating, miniaturized, sensing, elements, with, the, tip, of, the, fiber, these, can, be, implemented, by, various, micro, and, nanofabrication, technologies, such, that, they, do, not, exceed, the, microscopic, boundary, of, the, fiber, tip, allowing, for, such, applications, as, insertion, into, blood, vessels, via, hypodermic, needle, extrinsic, fiber, optic, sensors, use, an, optical, fiber, cable, normally, a, multi, mode, one, to, transmit, modulated, light, from, either, a, non, fiber, optical, sensor, or, an, electronic, sensor, connected, to, an, optical, transmitter, a, major, benefit, of, extrinsic, sensors, is, their, ability, to, reach, otherwise, inaccessible, places, an, example, is, the, measurement, of, temperature, inside, jet, engines, by, using, a, fiber, to, transmit, radiation, into, a, pyrometer, outside, the, engine, extrinsic, sensors, can, be, used, in, the, same, way, to, measure, the, internal, temperature, of, electrical, transformers, where, the, extreme, electromagnetic, fields, present, make, other, measurement, techniques, impossible, extrinsic, sensors, measure, vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and, torsion, a, solid, state, version, of, the, gyroscope, using, the, interference, of, light, has, been, developed, the, fiber, optic, gyroscope, fog, has, no, moving, parts, and, exploits, the, sagnac, effect, to, detect, mechanical, rotation, common, uses, for, fiber, optic, sensors, include, advanced, intrusion, detection, security, systems, the, light, is, transmitted, along, a, fiber, optic, sensor, cable, placed, on, a, fence, pipeline, or, communication, cabling, and, the, returned, signal, is, monitored, and, analyzed, for, disturbances, this, return, signal, is, digitally, processed, to, detect, disturbances, and, trip, an, alarm, if, an, intrusion, has, occurred, optical, fibers, are, widely, used, as, components, of, optical, chemical, sensors, and, optical, biosensors, optical, fiber, can, be, used, to, transmit, power, using, a, photovoltaic, cell, to, convert, the, light, into, electricity, while, this, method, of, power, transmission, is, not, as, efficient, as, conventional, ones, it, is, especially, useful, in, situations, where, it, is, desirable, not, to, have, a, metallic, conductor, as, in, the, case, of, use, near, mri, machines, which, produce, strong, magnetic, fields, other, examples, are, for, powering, electronics, in, high, powered, antenna, elements, and, measurement, devices, used, in, high, voltage, transmission, equipment, optical, fibers, are, used, as, light, guides, in, medical, and, other, applications, where, bright, light, needs, to, be, shone, on, a, target, without, a, clear, line, of, sight, path, many, microscopes, use, fiber, optic, light, sources, to, provide, intense, illumination, of, samples, being, studied, optical, fiber, is, also, used, in, imaging, optics, a, coherent, bundle, of, fibers, is, used, sometimes, along, with, lenses, for, a, long, thin, imaging, device, called, an, endoscope, which, is, used, to, view, objects, through, a, small, hole, medical, endoscopes, are, used, for, minimally, invasive, exploratory, or, surgical, procedures, industrial, endoscopes, see, fiberscope, or, borescope, are, used, for, inspecting, anything, hard, to, reach, such, as, jet, engine, interiors, in, some, buildings, optical, fibers, route, sunlight, from, the, roof, to, other, parts, of, the, building, see, nonimaging, optics, optical, fiber, lamps, are, used, for, illumination, in, decorative, applications, including, signs, art, toys, and, artificial, christmas, trees, optical, fiber, is, an, intrinsic, part, of, the, light, transmitting, concrete, building, product, litracon, optical, fiber, can, also, be, used, in, structural, health, monitoring, this, type, of, sensor, can, detect, stresses, that, may, have, a, lasting, impact, on, structures, it, is, based, on, the, principle, of, measuring, analog, attenuation, in, spectroscopy, optical, fiber, bundles, transmit, light, from, a, spectrometer, to, a, substance, that, cannot, be, placed, inside, the, spectrometer, itself, in, order, to, analyze, its, composition, a, spectrometer, analyzes, substances, by, bouncing, light, off, and, through, them, by, using, fibers, a, spectrometer, can, be, used, to, study, objects, remotely, an, optical, fiber, doped, with, certain, rare, earth, elements, such, as, erbium, can, be, used, as, the, gain, medium, of, a, fiber, laser, or, optical, amplifier, rare, earth, doped, optical, fibers, can, be, used, to, provide, signal, amplification, by, splicing, a, short, section, of, doped, fiber, into, a, regular, undoped, optical, fiber, line, the, doped, fiber, is, optically, pumped, with, a, second, laser, wavelength, that, is, coupled, into, the, line, in, addition, to, the, signal, wave, both, wavelengths, of, light, are, transmitted, through, the, doped, fiber, which, transfers, energy, from, the, second, pump, wavelength, to, the, signal, wave, the, process, that, causes, the, amplification, is, stimulated, emission, optical, fiber, is, also, widely, exploited, as, a, nonlinear, medium, the, glass, medium, supports, a, host, of, nonlinear, optical, interactions, and, the, long, interaction, lengths, possible, in, fiber, facilitate, a, variety, of, phenomena, which, are, harnessed, for, applications, and, fundamental, investigation, conversely, fiber, nonlinearity, can, have, deleterious, effects, on, optical, signals, and, measures, are, often, required, to, minimize, such, unwanted, effects, optical, fibers, doped, with, a, wavelength, shifter, collect, scintillation, light, in, physics, experiments, fiber, optic, sights, for, handguns, rifles, and, shotguns, use, pieces, of, optical, fiber, to, improve, the, visibility, of, markings, on, the, sight, an, optical, fiber, is, a, cylindrical, dielectric, waveguide, nonconducting, waveguide, that, transmits, light, along, its, axis, through, the, process, of, total, internal, reflection, the, fiber, consists, of, a, core, surrounded, by, a, cladding, layer, both, of, which, are, made, of, dielectric, materials, to, confine, the, optical, signal, in, the, core, the, refractive, index, of, the, core, must, be, greater, than, that, of, the, cladding, the, boundary, between, the, core, and, cladding, may, either, be, abrupt, in, step, index, fiber, or, gradual, in, graded, index, fiber, light, can, be, fed, into, optical, fibers, using, lasers, or, leds, fiber, is, immune, to, electrical, interference, as, there, is, no, cross, talk, between, signals, in, different, cables, and, no, pickup, of, environmental, noise, information, traveling, inside, the, optical, fiber, is, even, immune, to, electromagnetic, pulses, generated, by, nuclear, devices, fiber, cables, do, not, conduct, electricity, which, makes, fiber, useful, for, protecting, communications, equipment, in, high, voltage, environments, such, as, power, generation, facilities, or, applications, prone, to, lightning, strikes, the, electrical, isolation, also, prevents, problems, with, ground, loops, because, there, is, no, electricity, in, optical, cables, that, could, potentially, generate, sparks, they, can, be, used, in, environments, where, explosive, fumes, are, present, wiretapping, in, this, case, fiber, tapping, is, more, difficult, compared, to, electrical, connections, fiber, cables, are, not, targeted, for, metal, theft, in, contrast, copper, cable, systems, use, large, amounts, of, copper, and, have, been, targeted, since, the, 2000s, commodities, boom, the, refractive, index, is, a, way, of, measuring, the, speed, of, light, in, a, material, light, travels, fastest, in, a, vacuum, such, as, in, outer, space, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, is, about, 300, 000, kilometers, 186, 000, miles, per, second, the, refractive, index, of, a, medium, is, calculated, by, dividing, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, by, the, speed, of, light, in, that, medium, the, refractive, index, of, a, vacuum, is, therefore, 1, by, definition, a, typical, single, mode, fiber, used, for, telecommunications, has, a, cladding, made, of, pure, silica, with, an, index, of, 1, 444, at, 1500, nm, and, a, core, of, doped, silica, with, an, index, around, 1, 4475, the, larger, the, index, of, refraction, the, slower, light, travels, in, that, medium, from, this, information, a, simple, rule, of, thumb, is, that, a, signal, using, optical, fiber, for, communication, will, travel, at, around, 200, 000, kilometers, per, second, thus, a, phone, call, carried, by, fiber, between, sydney, and, new, york, a, 16, 000, kilometer, distance, means, that, there, is, a, minimum, delay, of, 80, milliseconds, about, 1, 12, displaystyle, tfrac, 1, 12, of, a, second, between, when, one, caller, speaks, and, the, other, hears, when, light, traveling, in, an, optically, dense, medium, hits, a, boundary, at, a, steep, angle, of, incidence, larger, than, the, critical, angle, for, the, boundary, the, light, is, completely, reflected, this, is, called, total, internal, reflection, this, effect, is, used, in, optical, fibers, to, confine, light, in, the, core, most, modern, optical, fiber, is, weakly, guiding, meaning, that, the, difference, in, refractive, index, between, the, core, and, the, cladding, is, very, small, typically, less, than, 1, light, travels, through, the, fiber, core, bouncing, back, and, forth, off, the, boundary, between, the, core, and, cladding, because, the, light, must, strike, the, boundary, with, an, angle, greater, than, the, critical, angle, only, light, that, enters, the, fiber, within, a, certain, range, of, angles, can, travel, down, the, fiber, without, leaking, out, this, range, of, angles, is, called, the, acceptance, cone, of, the, fiber, there, is, a, maximum, angle, from, the, fiber, axis, at, which, light, may, enter, the, fiber, so, that, it, will, propagate, or, travel, in, the, core, of, the, fiber, the, sine, of, this, maximum, angle, is, the, numerical, aperture, na, of, the, fiber, fiber, with, a, larger, na, requires, less, precision, to, splice, and, work, with, than, fiber, with, a, smaller, na, the, size, of, this, acceptance, cone, is, a, function, of, the, refractive, index, difference, between, the, fiber, s, core, and, cladding, single, mode, fiber, has, a, small, na, fiber, with, large, core, diameter, greater, than, 10, micrometers, may, be, analyzed, by, geometrical, optics, such, fiber, is, called, multi, mode, fiber, from, the, electromagnetic, analysis, see, below, in, a, step, index, multi, mode, fiber, rays, of, light, are, guided, along, the, fiber, core, by, total, internal, reflection, rays, that, meet, the, core, cladding, boundary, at, an, angle, measured, relative, to, a, line, normal, to, the, boundary, greater, than, the, critical, angle, for, this, boundary, are, completely, reflected, the, critical, angle, is, determined, by, the, difference, in, the, index, of, refraction, between, the, core, and, cladding, materials, rays, that, meet, the, boundary, at, a, low, angle, are, refracted, from, the, core, into, the, cladding, where, they, terminate, the, critical, angle, determines, the, acceptance, angle, of, the, fiber, often, reported, as, a, numerical, aperture, a, high, numerical, aperture, allows, light, to, propagate, down, the, fiber, in, rays, both, close, to, the, axis, and, at, various, angles, allowing, efficient, coupling, of, light, into, the, fiber, however, this, high, numerical, aperture, increases, the, amount, of, dispersion, as, rays, at, different, angles, have, different, path, lengths, and, therefore, take, different, amounts, of, time, to, traverse, the, fiber, in, graded, index, fiber, the, index, of, refraction, in, the, core, decreases, continuously, between, the, axis, and, the, cladding, this, causes, light, rays, to, bend, smoothly, as, they, approach, the, cladding, rather, than, reflecting, abruptly, from, the, core, cladding, boundary, the, resulting, curved, paths, reduce, multi, path, dispersion, because, high, angle, rays, pass, more, through, the, lower, index, periphery, of, the, core, rather, than, the, high, index, center, the, index, profile, is, chosen, to, minimize, the, difference, in, axial, propagation, speeds, of, the, various, rays, in, the, fiber, this, ideal, index, profile, is, very, close, to, a, parabolic, relationship, between, the, index, and, the, distance, from, the, axis, fiber, with, a, core, diameter, less, than, about, ten, times, the, wavelength, of, the, propagating, light, cannot, be, modeled, using, geometric, optics, instead, it, must, be, analyzed, as, an, electromagnetic, waveguide, structure, according, to, maxwell, s, equations, as, reduced, to, the, electromagnetic, wave, equation, as, an, optical, waveguide, the, fiber, supports, one, or, more, confined, transverse, modes, by, which, light, can, propagate, along, the, fiber, fiber, supporting, only, one, mode, is, called, single, mode, the, waveguide, analysis, shows, that, the, light, energy, in, the, fiber, is, not, completely, confined, in, the, core, instead, especially, in, single, mode, fibers, a, significant, fraction, of, the, energy, in, the, bound, mode, travels, in, the, cladding, as, an, evanescent, wave, the, most, common, type, of, single, mode, fiber, has, a, core, diameter, of, 8, 10, micrometers, and, is, designed, for, use, in, the, near, infrared, multi, mode, fiber, by, comparison, is, manufactured, with, core, diameters, as, small, as, 50, micrometers, and, as, large, as, hundreds, of, micrometers, some, special, purpose, optical, fiber, is, constructed, with, a, non, cylindrical, core, or, cladding, layer, usually, with, an, elliptical, or, rectangular, cross, section, these, include, polarization, maintaining, fiber, used, in, fiber, optic, sensors, and, fiber, designed, to, suppress, whispering, gallery, mode, propagation, photonic, crystal, fiber, is, made, with, a, regular, pattern, of, index, variation, often, in, the, form, of, cylindrical, holes, that, run, along, the,

fiber, can, be, tailored, to, a, wide, variety, of, applications, attenuation, in, fiber, optics, also, known, as, transmission, loss, is, the, reduction, in, the, intensity, of, the, light, signal, as, it, travels, through, the, transmission, medium, attenuation, coefficients, in, fiber, optics, are, usually, expressed, in, units, of, db, km, the, medium, is, usually, a, fiber, of, silica, glass, that, confines, the, incident, light, beam, within, attenuation, is, an, important, factor, limiting, the, transmission, of, a, digital, signal, across, large, distances, thus, much, research, has, gone, into, both, limiting, the, attenuation, and, maximizing, the, amplification, of, the, optical, signal, the, four, orders, of, magnitude, reduction, in, the, attenuation, of, silica, optical, fibers, over, four, decades, was, the, result, of, constant, improvement, of, manufacturing, processes, raw, material, purity, preform, and, fiber, designs, which, allowed, for, these, fibers, to, approach, the, theoretical, lower, limit, of, attenuation, single, mode, optical, fibers, can, be, made, with, extremely, low, loss, corning, s, vascade, ex2500, fiber, a, low, loss, single, mode, fiber, for, telecommunications, wavelengths, has, a, nominal, attenuation, of, 0, 148, db, km, at, 1550, nm, a, 10, km, length, of, such, fiber, transmits, nearly, 71, of, optical, energy, at, 1550, nm, attenuation, in, optical, fiber, is, caused, primarily, by, both, scattering, and, absorption, in, fibers, based, on, fluoride, glasses, such, as, zblan, minimum, attenuation, is, limited, by, impurity, absorption, vast, majority, of, optical, fibers, are, based, on, silica, glass, where, impurity, absorption, is, negligible, in, silica, fibers, attenuation, is, determined, by, intrinsic, mechanisms, rayleigh, scattering, in, the, glasses, through, which, the, light, is, propagating, and, infrared, absorption, in, the, same, glasses, absorption, in, silica, increases, steeply, at, wavelengths, above, 1570, nm, at, wavelengths, most, useful, for, telecommunications, rayleigh, scattering, is, the, dominant, loss, mechanism, at, 1550, nm, attenuation, components, for, a, record, low, loss, fiber, are, given, as, follows, rayleigh, scattering, loss, 0, 1200, db, km, infrared, absorption, loss, 0, 0150, db, km, impurity, absorption, loss, 0, 0047, db, km, waveguide, imperfection, loss, 0, 0010, db, km, the, propagation, of, light, through, the, core, of, an, optical, fiber, is, based, on, the, total, internal, reflection, of, the, lightwave, in, terms, of, geometric, optics, or, guided, modes, in, terms, of, electromagnetic, waveguide, in, a, typical, single, mode, optical, fiber, about, 75, of, light, is, propagating, through, the, core, material, having, higher, refractive, index, and, about, 25, of, light, is, propagating, through, the, cladding, having, lower, refractive, index, the, interface, between, the, core, and, cladding, glasses, is, exceptionally, smooth, and, does, not, give, rise, to, a, significant, scattering, loss, or, a, waveguide, imperfection, loss, the, scattering, loss, originates, primarily, from, the, rayleigh, scattering, in, the, bulk, of, the, glasses, composing, the, fiber, core, and, cladding, the, scattering, of, light, in, optical, quality, glass, fiber, is, caused, by, molecular, level, irregularities, compositional, fluctuations, in, the, glass, structure, indeed, one, emerging, school, of, thought, is, that, glass, is, simply, the, limiting, case, of, a, polycrystalline, solid, within, this, framework, domains, exhibiting, various, degrees, of, short, range, order, become, the, building, blocks, of, metals, as, well, as, glasses, and, ceramics, distributed, both, between, and, within, these, domains, are, micro, structural, defects, that, provide, the, most, ideal, locations, for, light, scattering, scattering, depends, on, the, wavelength, of, the, light, being, scattered, and, on, the, size, of, the, scattering, centers, angular, dependence, of, the, light, intensity, scattered, from, an, optical, fiber, matched, that, of, rayleigh, scattering, indicating, that, the, scattering, centers, are, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, of, propagating, light, it, originates, from, the, density, fluctuations, driven, by, fictive, temperature, of, the, glass, and, from, the, concentration, fluctuations, of, dopants, in, both, the, core, and, the, cladding, rayleigh, scattering, coefficient, r, can, be, presented, as, r, r, d, r, c, displaystyle, r, r,

germanium, dioxide, or, fluorine, are, used, to, create, the, refractive, index, difference, between, the, core, and, the, cladding, to, form, a, waveguide, structure, r, d, 8, 3, 3, 4, n, 8, p, 2, c,

dramatically, reduced, by, about, 100, wt, ppm, of, alkali, oxide, dopant, in, the, fiber, core, as, well, as, slower, cooling, of, the, fiber, during, the, fiber, draw, process, these, approaches, are, used, to, produce, optical, fibers, with, the, lowest, attenuation, especially, those, for, submarine, telecom, cables, for, small, dopant, concentrations, r, c, is, proportional, to, x, d, n, d, x, 2, where, x, is, the, mole, fraction, of, the, dopant, in, sio, 2, based, glass, and, n, is, the, refractive, index, of, the, glass, when, geo, 2, dopant, is, used, to, increase, the, refractive, index, of, the, fiber, core, it, increases, the, concentration, fluctuation, component, of, rayleigh, scattering, and, attenuation, of, the, fiber, this, is, why, the, lowest, attenuation, fibers, do, not, use, geo, 2, in, the, core, and, use, fluorine, in, the, cladding, to, reduce, the, refractive, index, of, the, cladding, r, c, in, pure, silica, core, fiber, is, proportional, to, the, overlap,

fluctuations, play, a, significant, role, as, the, concentrations, of, k, 2, o, fluorine, and, chlorine, are, very, low, the, density, fluctuations, in, the, core, are, moderated, by, lower, fictive, temperature, resulting, from, potassium, doping, and, are, further, reduced, by, annealing, during, the, fiber, draw, process, this, differs, from, the, cladding, where, higher, fluorine, dopant, levels, and, the, resulting, concentration, fluctuations, add, to, the, loss, in, such, fibers, the, light, travelling, through, the, core, experiences, lower, scattering, and, lower, attenuation, compared, to, the, light, propagating, through, the, cladding, segment, of, the, fiber, at, high, optical, powers, scattering, can, also, be, caused, by, nonlinear, optical, processes, in, the, fiber, in, addition, to, light, scattering, attenuation, or, signal, loss, can, also, occur, due, to, selective, absorption, of, specific, wavelengths, primary, material, considerations, include, both, electrons, and, molecules, as, follows, the, design, of, any, optically, transparent, device, requires, the, selection, of, materials, based, upon, knowledge, of, its, properties, and, limitations, the, crystal, structure, absorption, characteristics, observed, at, the, lower, frequency, regions, mid, to, far, ir, wavelength, range, define, the, long, wavelength, transparency, limit, of, the, material, they, are, the, result, of, the, interactive, coupling, between, the, motions, of, thermally, induced, vibrations, of, the, constituent, atoms, and, molecules, of, the, solid, lattice, and, the, incident, light, wave, radiation, hence, all, materials, are, bounded, by, limiting, regions, of, absorption, caused, by, atomic, and, molecular, vibrations, bond, stretching, in, the, far, infrared, 10, m, in, other, words, the, selective, absorption, of, ir, light, by, a, particular, material, occurs, because, the, selected, frequency, of, the, light, wave, matches, the, frequency, or, an, integer, multiple, of, the, frequency, i, e, harmonic, at, which, the, particles, of, that, material, vibrate, since, different, atoms, and, molecules, have, different, natural, frequencies, of, vibration, they, will, selectively, absorb, different, frequencies, or, portions, of, the, spectrum, of, ir, light, reflection, and, transmission, of, light, waves, occur, because, the, frequencies, of, the, light, waves, do, not, match, the, natural, resonant, frequencies, of, vibration, of, the, objects, when, ir, light, of, these, frequencies, strikes, an, object, the, energy, is, either, reflected, or, transmitted, attenuation, over, a, cable, run, is, significantly, increased, by, the, inclusion, of, connectors, and, splices, when, computing, the, acceptable, attenuation, loss, budget, between, a, transmitter, and, a, receiver, one, includes, connectors, typically, introduce, 0, 3, db, per, connector, on, well, polished, connectors, splices, typically, introduce, less, than, 0, 2, db, per, splice, the, total, loss, can, be, calculated, by, where, the, db, loss, per, kilometer, is, a, function, of, the, type, of, fiber, and, can, be, found, in, the, manufacturer, s, specifications, for, example, a, typical, 1550, nm, single, mode, fiber, has, a, loss, of, 0, 3, db, per, kilometer, the, calculated, loss, budget, is, used, when, testing, to, confirm, that, the, measured, loss, is, within, the, normal, operating, parameters, glass, optical, fibers, are, almost, always, made, from, silica, but, some, other, materials, such, as, fluorozirconate, fluoroaluminate, and, chalcogenide, glasses, as, well, as, crystalline, materials, like, sapphire, are, used, for, longer, wavelength, infrared, or, other, specialized, applications, silica, and, fluoride, glasses, usually, have, refractive, indices, of, about, 1, 5, but, some, materials, such, as, the, chalcogenides, can, have, indices, as, high, as, 3, typically, the, index, difference, between, core, and, cladding, is, less, than, one, percent, plastic, optical, fibers, pof, are, commonly, step, index, multi, mode, fibers, with, a, core, diameter, of, 0, 5, millimeters, or, larger, pof, typically, have, higher, attenuation, coefficients, than, glass, fibers, 1, db, m, or, higher, and, this, high, attenuation, limits, the, range, of, pof, based, systems, silica, exhibits, fairly, good, optical, transmission, over, a, wide, range, of, wavelengths, in, the, near, infrared, near, ir, portion, of, the, spectrum, particularly, around, 1, 5, m, silica, can, have, extremely, low, absorption, and, scattering, losses, of, the, order, of, 0, 2, db, km, such, low, losses, depend, on, using, ultra, pure, silica, a, high, transparency, in, the, 1, 4, m, region, is, achieved, by, maintaining, a, low, concentration, of, hydroxyl, groups, oh, alternatively, a, high, oh, concentration, is, better, for, transmission, in, the, ultraviolet, uv, region, silica, can, be, drawn, into, fibers, at, reasonably, high, temperatures, and, has, a, fairly, broad, glass, transformation, range, one, other, advantage, is, that, fusion, splicing, and, cleaving, of, silica, fibers, is, relatively, effective, silica, fiber, also, has, high, mechanical, strength, against, both, pulling, and, even, bending, provided, that, the, fiber, is, not, too, thick, and, that, the, surfaces, have, been, well, prepared, during, processing, even, simple, cleaving, of, the, ends, of, the, fiber, can, provide, nicely, flat, surfaces, with, acceptable, optical, quality, silica, is, also, relatively, chemically, inert, in, particular, it, is, not, hygroscopic, does, not, absorb, water, silica, glass, can, be, doped, with, various, materials, one, purpose, of, doping, is, to, raise, the, refractive, index, e, g, with, germanium, dioxide, geo, 2, or, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, or, to, lower, it, e, g, with, fluorine, or, boron, trioxide, b, 2, o, 3, doping, is, also, possible, with, laser, active, ions, for, example, rare, earth, doped, fibers, in, order, to, obtain, active, fibers, to, be, used, for, example, in, fiber, amplifiers, or, laser, applications, both, the, fiber, core, and, cladding, are, typically, doped, so, that, the, entire, assembly, core, and, cladding, is, effectively, the, same, compound, e, g, an, aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate, or, borosilicate, glass, particularly, for, active, fibers, pure, silica, is, usually, not, a, very, suitable, host, glass, because, it, exhibits, a, low, solubility, for, rare, earth, ions, this, can, lead, to, quenching, effects, due, to, the, clustering, of, dopant, ions, aluminosilicates, are, much, more, effective, in, this, respect, silica, fiber, also, exhibits, a, high, threshold, for, optical, damage, this, property, ensures, a, low, tendency, for, laser, induced, breakdown, this, is, important, for, fiber, amplifiers, when, utilized, for, the, amplification, of, short, pulses, because, of, these, properties, silica, fibers, are, the, material, of, choice, in, many, optical, applications, such, as, communications, except, for, very, short, distances, with, plastic, optical, fiber, fiber, lasers, fiber, amplifiers, and, fiber, optic, sensors, large, efforts, put, forth, in, the, development, of, various, types, of, silica, fibers, have, further, increased, the, performance, of, such, fibers, over, other, materials, fluoride, glass, is, a, class, of, non, oxide, optical, quality, glasses, composed, of, fluorides, of, various, metals, because, of, the, low, viscosity, of, these, glasses, it, is, very, difficult, to, completely, avoid, crystallization, while, processing, it, through, the, glass, transition, or, drawing, the, fiber, from, the, melt, thus, although, heavy, metal, fluoride, glasses, hmfg, exhibit, very, low, optical, attenuation, they, are, not, only, difficult, to, manufacture, but, are, quite, fragile, and, have, poor, resistance, to, moisture, and, other, environmental, attacks, their, best, attribute, is, that, they, lack, the, absorption, band, associated, with, the, hydroxyl, oh, group, 3, 200, 3, 600, cm, 1, i, e, 2, 777, 3, 125, nm, or, 2, 78, 3, 13, m, which, is, present, in, nearly, all, oxide, based, glasses, such, low, losses, were, never, realized, in, practice, and, the, fragility, and, high, cost, of, fluoride, fibers, made, them, less, than, ideal, as, primary, candidates, fluoride, fibers, are, used, in, mid, ir, spectroscopy, fiber, optic, sensors, thermometry, and, imaging, fluoride, fibers, can, be, used, for, guided, lightwave, transmission, in, media, such, as, yag, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, lasers, at, 2, 9, m, as, required, for, medical, applications, e, g, ophthalmology, and, dentistry, an, example, of, a, heavy, metal, fluoride, glass, is, the, zblan, glass, group, composed, of, zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminium, and, sodium, fluorides, their, main, technological, application, is, as, optical, waveguides, in, both, planar, and, fiber, forms, they, are, advantageous, especially, in, the, mid, infrared, 2, 000, 5, 000, nm, range, phosphate, glass, is, a, class, of, optical, glasses, composed, of, metaphosphates, of, various, metals, instead, of, the, sio, 4, tetrahedra, observed, in, silicate, glasses, the, building, block, for, this, glass, phosphorus, pentoxide, p, 2, o, 5, which, crystallizes, in, at, least, four, different, forms, the, most, familiar, polymorph, is, the, cagelike, structure, of, p, 4, o, 10, phosphate, glasses, can, be, advantageous, over, silica, glasses, for, optical, fibers, with, a, high, concentration, of, doping, rare, earth, ions, a, mix, of, fluoride, glass, and, phosphate, glass, is, fluorophosphate, glass, the, chalcogens, the, elements, in, group, 16, of, the, periodic, table, particularly, sulfur, s, selenium, se, and, tellurium, te, react, with, more, electropositive, elements, such, as, silver, to, form, chalcogenides, these, are, extremely, versatile, compounds, in, that, they, can, be, crystalline, or, amorphous, metallic, or, semiconducting, and, conductors, of, ions, or, electrons, chalcogenide, glass, can, be, used, to, make, fibers, for, far, infrared, transmission, standard, optical, fibers, are, made, by, first, constructing, a, large, diameter, preform, with, a, carefully, controlled, refractive, index, profile, and, then, pulling, the, preform, to, form, the, long, thin, optical, fiber, the, preform, is, commonly, made, by, three, chemical, vapor, deposition, methods, inside, vapor, deposition, outside, vapor, deposition, and, vapor, axial, deposition, with, inside, vapor, deposition, the, preform, starts, as, a, hollow, glass, tube, approximately, 40, centimeters, 16, in, long, which, is, placed, horizontally, and, rotated, slowly, on, a, lathe, gases, such, as, silicon, tetrachloride, sicl, 4, or, germanium, tetrachloride, gecl, 4, are, injected, with, oxygen, in, the, end, of, the, tube, the, gases, are, then, heated, by, means, of, an, external, hydrogen, burner, bringing, the, temperature, of, the, gas, up, to, 1, 900, k, 1, 600, c, 3, 000, f, where, the, tetrachlorides, react, with, oxygen, to, produce, silica, or, germanium, dioxide, particles, when, the, reaction, conditions, are, chosen, to, allow, this, reaction, to, occur, in, the, gas, phase, throughout, the, tube, volume, in, contrast, to, earlier, techniques, where, the, reaction, occurred, only, on, the, glass, surface, this, technique, is, called, modified, chemical, vapor, deposition, the, oxide, particles, then, agglomerate, to, form, large, particle, chains, which, subsequently, deposit, on, the, walls, of, the, tube, as, soot, the, deposition, is, due, to, the, large, difference, in, temperature, between, the, gas, core, and, the, wall, causing, the, gas, to, push, the, particles, outward, in, a, process, known, as, thermophoresis, the, torch, is, then, traversed, up, and, down, the, length, of, the, tube, to, deposit, the, material, evenly, after, the, torch, has, reached, the, end, of, the, tube, it, is, then, brought, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, tube, and, the, deposited, particles, are, then, melted, to, form, a, solid, layer, this, process, is, repeated, until, a, sufficient, amount, of, material, has, been, deposited, for, each, layer, the, composition, can, be, modified, by, varying, the, gas, composition, resulting, in, precise, control, of, the, finished, fiber, s, optical, properties, in, outside, vapor, deposition, or, vapor, axial, deposition, the, glass, is, formed, by, flame, hydrolysis, a, reaction, in, which, silicon, tetrachloride, and, germanium, tetrachloride, are, oxidized, by, reaction, with, water, in, an, oxyhydrogen, flame, in, outside, vapor, deposition, the, glass, is, deposited, onto, a, solid, rod, which, is, removed, before, further, processing, in, vapor, axial, deposition, a, short, seed, rod, is, used, and, a, porous, preform, whose, length, is, not, limited, by, the, size, of, the, source, rod, is, built, up, on, its, end, the, porous, preform, is, consolidated, into, a, transparent, solid, preform, by, heating, to, about, 1, 800, k, 1, 500, c, 2, 800, f, typical, communications, fiber, uses, a, circular, preform, for, some, applications, such, as, double, clad, fibers, another, form, is, preferred, in, fiber, lasers, based, on, double, clad, fiber, an, asymmetric, shape, improves, the, filling, factor, for, laser, pumping, because, of, the, surface, tension, the, shape, is, smoothed, during, the, drawing, process, and, the, shape, of, the, resulting, fiber, does, not, reproduce, the, sharp, edges, of, the, preform, nevertheless, careful, polishing, of, the, preform, is, important, since, any, defects, of, the, preform, surface, affect, the, optical, and, mechanical, properties, of, the, resulting, fiber, the, preform, regardless, of, construction, is, placed, in, a, device, known, as, a, drawing, tower, where, the, preform, tip, is, heated, and, the, optical, fiber, is, pulled, out, as, a, string, the, tension, on, the, fiber, can, be, controlled, to, maintain, the, desired, fiber, thickness, the, light, is, guided, down, the, core, of, the, fiber, by, an, optical, cladding, with, a, lower, refractive, index, that, traps, light, in, the, core, through, total, internal, reflection, for, some, types, of, fiber, the, cladding, is, made, of, glass, and, is, drawn, along, with, the, core, from, a, preform, with, radially, varying, index, of, refraction, for, other, types, of, fiber, the, cladding, made, of, plastic, and, is, applied, like, a, coating, see, below, the, cladding, is, coated, by, a, buffer, not, to, be, confused, with, an, actual, buffer, tube, that, protects, it, from, moisture, and, physical, damage, these, coatings, are, uv, cured, urethane, acrylate, composite, or, polyimide, materials, applied, to, the, outside, of, the, fiber, during, the, drawing, process, the, coatings, protect, the, very, delicate, strands, of, glass, fiber, about, the, size, of, a, human, hair, and, allow, it, to, survive, the, rigors, of, manufacturing, proof, testing, cabling, and, installation, the, buffer, coating, must, be, stripped, off, the, fiber, for, termination, or, splicing, today, s, glass, optical, fiber, draw, processes, employ, a, dual, layer, coating, approach, an, inner, primary, coating, is, designed, to, act, as, a, shock, absorber, to, minimize, attenuation, caused, by, microbending, an, outer, secondary, coating, protects, the, primary, coating, against, mechanical, damage, and, acts, as, a, barrier, to, lateral, forces, and, may, be, colored, to, differentiate, strands, in, bundled, cable, constructions, these, fiber, optic, coating, layers, are, applied, during, the, fiber, draw, at, speeds, approaching, 100, kilometers, per, hour, 60, mph, fiber, optic, coatings, are, applied, using, one, of, two, methods, wet, on, dry, and, wet, on, wet, in, wet, on, dry, the, fiber, passes, through, a, primary, coating, application, which, is, then, uv, cured, then, through, the, secondary, coating, application, which, is, subsequently, cured, in, wet, on, wet, the, fiber, passes, through, both, the, primary, and, secondary, coating, applications, then, goes, to, uv, curing, the, thickness, of, the, coating, is, taken, into, account, when, calculating, the, stress, that, the, fiber, experiences, under, different, bend, configurations, when, a, coated, fiber, is, wrapped, around, a, mandrel, the, stress, experienced, by, the, fiber, is, given, by, 45, e, d, f, d, m, d, c, displaystyle, sigma, e, d, text, f, over, d, text, m, d, text, c, where, e, is, the, fiber, s, young, s, modulus, d, m, is, the, diameter, of, the, mandrel, d, f, is, the, diameter, of, the, cladding, and, d, c, is, the, diameter, of, the, coating, in, a, two,

period, fiber, fatigue, can, occur, over, time, or, in, extreme, conditions, these, factors, combine, to, cause, microscopic, flaws, in, the, glass, fiber, to, propagate, which, can, ultimately, result, in, fiber, failure, three, key, characteristics, of, fiber, optic, waveguides, can, be, affected, by, environmental, conditions, strength, attenuation, and, resistance, to, losses, caused, by, microbending, external, optical, fiber, cable, jackets, and, buffer, tubes, protect, glass, optical, fiber, from, environmental, conditions, that, can, affect, the, fiber, s, performance, and, long, term, durability, on, the, inside, coatings, ensure, the, reliability, of, the, signal, being, carried, and, help, minimize, attenuation, due, to, microbending, in, practical, fibers, the, cladding, is, usually, coated, with, a, tough, resin, and, features, an, additional, buffer, layer, which, may, be, further, surrounded, by, a, jacket, layer, usually, plastic, these, layers, add, strength, to, the, fiber, but, do, not, affect, its, optical, properties, rigid, fiber, assemblies, sometimes, put, light, absorbing, glass, between, the, fibers, to, prevent, light, that, leaks, out, of, one,

reinforced, with, aramid, yarns, or, glass, yarns, as, an, intermediary, strength, member, in, commercial, terms, usage, of, the, glass, yarns, are, more, cost, effective, with, no, loss, of, mechanical, durability, glass, yarns, also, protect, the, cable, core, against, rodents, and, termites, fiber, cable, can, be, very, flexible, but, traditional, fiber, s, loss, increases, greatly, if, the, fiber, is, bent, with, a, radius, smaller, than, around, 30, mm, this, creates, a, problem, when, the, cable, is, bent, around, corners, bendable, fibers, targeted, toward, easier, installation, in, home, environments, have, been, standardized, as, itu, t, g, 657, this, type, of, fiber, can, be, bent, with, a, radius, as, low, as, 7, 5, mm, without, adverse, impact, even, more, bendable, fibers, have, been, developed, bendable, fiber, may, also, be, resistant, to, fiber, hacking, in, which, the, signal, in, a, fiber, is, surreptitiously, monitored, by, bending, the, fiber, and, detecting, the, leakage, another, important, feature, of, cable, is, cable, s, ability, to, withstand, tension, which, determines, how, much, force, can, be, applied, to, the, cable, during, installation, optical, fibers, are, connected, to, terminal, equipment, by, optical, fiber, connectors, these, connectors, are, usually, of, a, standard, type, such, as, fc, sc, st, lc, mtrj, mpo, or, sma, optical, fibers, may, be, connected, by, connectors, typically, on, a, patch, panel, or, permanently, by, splicing, that, is, joining, two, fibers, together, to, form, a, continuous, optical, waveguide, the, generally, accepted, splicing, method, is, fusion, splicing, which, melts, the, fiber, ends, together, for, quicker, fastening, jobs, a, mechanical, splice, is, used, all, splicing, techniques, involve, installing, an, enclosure, that, protects, the, splice, fusion, splicing, is, done, with, a, specialized, instrument, the, fiber, ends, are, first, stripped, of, their, protective, polymer, coating, as, well, as, the, more, sturdy, outer, jacket, if, present, the, ends, are, cleaved, with, a, precision, cleaver, to, make, them, perpendicular, and, are, placed, into, special, holders, in, the, fusion, splicer, the, splice, is, usually, inspected, via, a, magnified, viewing, screen, to, check, the, cleaves, before, and, fusion, after, the, splice, the, splicer, uses, small, motors, to, align, the, end, faces, together, and, emits, a, small, spark, between, electrodes, at, the, gap, to, burn, off, dust, and, moisture, then, the, splicer, generates, a, larger, spark, that, raises, the, temperature, above, the, melting, point, of, the, glass, fusing, the, ends, permanently, the, location, and, energy, of, the, spark, is, carefully, controlled, so, that, the, molten, core, and, cladding, do, not, mix, and, this, minimizes, optical, loss, a, splice, loss, estimate, is, measured, by, the, splicer, by, directing, light, through, the, cladding, on, one, side, and, measuring, the, light, leaking, from, the, cladding, on, the, other, side, a, splice, loss, under, 0, 1, db, is, typical, the, complexity, of, this, process, makes, fiber, splicing, much, more, difficult, than, splicing, copper, wire, mechanical, fiber, splices, are, designed, to, be, quicker, and, easier, to, install, but, there, is, still, the, need, for, stripping, careful, cleaning, and, precision, cleaving, the, fiber, ends, are, aligned, and, held, together, by, a, precision, sleeve, often, using, a, clear, index, matching, gel, that, enhances, the, transmission, of, light, across, the, joint, mechanical, splices, typically, have, a, higher, optical, loss, and, are, less, robust, than, fusion, splices, especially, if, the, gel, is, used, fibers, are, terminated, in, connectors, that, hold, the, fiber, end, precisely, and, securely, an, optical, fiber, connector, is, a, rigid, cylindrical, barrel, surrounded, by, a, sleeve, that, holds, the, barrel, in, its, mating, socket, the, mating, mechanism, can, be, push, and, click, turn, and, latch, bayonet, mount, or, screw, in, threaded, the, barrel, is, typically, free, to, move, within, the, sleeve, and, may, have, a, key, that, prevents, the, barrel, and, fiber, from, rotating, as, the, connectors, are, mated, a, typical, connector, is, installed, by, preparing, the, fiber, end, and, inserting, it, into, the, rear, of, the, connector, body, quick, set, adhesive, is, usually, used, to, hold, the, fiber, securely, and, a, strain, relief, is, secured, to, the, rear, once, the, adhesive, sets, the, fiber, s, end, is, polished, various, polish, profiles, are, used, depending, on, the, type, of, fiber, and, the, application, the, resulting, signal, strength, loss, is, called, gap, loss, for, single, mode, fiber, fiber, ends, are, typically, polished, with, a, slight, curvature, that, makes, the, mated, connectors, touch, only, at, their, cores, this, is, called, a, physical, contact, pc, polish, the, curved, surface, may, be, polished, at, an, angle, to, make, an, angled, physical, contact, apc, connection, such, connections, have, higher, loss, than, pc, connections, but, greatly, reduced, back, reflection, because, light, that, reflects, from, the, angled, surface, leaks, out, of, the, fiber, core, apc, fiber, ends, have, low, back, reflection, even, when, disconnected, in, the, 1990s, the, number, of, parts, per, connector, polishing, of, the, fibers, and, the, need, to, oven, bake, the, epoxy, in, each, connector, made, terminating, fiber, optic, cables, difficult, today, connector, types, on, the, market, offer, easier, less, labor, intensive, ways, of, terminating, cables, some, of, the, most, popular, connectors, are, pre, polished, at, the, factory, and, include, a, gel, inside, the, connector, a, cleave, is, made, at, a, required, length, to, get, as, close, to, the, polished, piece, already, inside, the, connector, the, gel, surrounds, the, point, where, the, two, pieces, meet, inside, the, connector, for, very, little, light, loss, for, the, most, demanding, installations, factory, pre, polished, pigtails, of, sufficient, length, to, reach, the, first, fusion, splice, enclosure, assures, good, performance, and, minimizes, on, site, labor, it, is, often, necessary, to, align, an, optical, fiber, with, another, optical, fiber, or, with, an, optoelectronic, device, such, as, a, light, emitting, diode, a, laser, diode, or, a, modulator, this, can, involve, either, carefully, aligning, the, fiber, and, placing, it, in, contact, with, the, device, or, can, use, a, lens, to, allow, coupling, over, an, air, gap, typically, the, size, of, the, fiber, mode, is, much, larger, than, the, size, of, the, mode, in, a, laser, diode, or, a, silicon, optical, chip, in, this, case, a, tapered, or, lensed, fiber, is, used, to, match, the, fiber, mode, field, distribution, to, that, of, the, other, element, the, lens, on, the, end, of, the, fiber, can, be, formed, using, polishing, laser, cutting, or, fusion, splicing, in, a, laboratory, environment, a, bare, fiber, end, is, coupled, using, a, fiber, launch, system, which, uses, a, microscope, objective, lens, to, focus, the, light, down, to, a, fine, point, a, precision, translation, stage, micro, positioning, table, is, used, to, move, the, lens, fiber, or, device, to, allow, the, coupling, efficiency, to, be, optimized, fibers, with, a, connector, on, the, end, make, this, process, much, simpler, the, connector, is, simply, plugged, into, a, pre, aligned, fiber, optic, collimator, which, contains, a, lens, that, is, either, accurately, positioned, to, the, fiber, or, is, adjustable, to, achieve, the, best, injection, efficiency, into, a, single, mode, fiber, the, direction, position, size, and, divergence, of, the, beam, must, all, be, optimized, with, good, optimization, 70, to, 90, coupling, efficiency, can, be, achieved, with, properly, polished, single, mode, fibers, the, emitted, beam, has, an, almost, perfect, gaussian, shape, even, in, the, far, field, if, a, good, lens, is, used, the, lens, needs, to, be, large, enough, to, support, the, full, numerical, aperture, of, the, fiber, and, must, not, introduce, aberrations, in, the, beam, aspheric, lenses, are, typically, used, at, high, optical, intensities, above, 2, megawatts, per, square, centimeter, when, a, fiber, is, subjected, to, a, shock, or, is, otherwise, suddenly, damaged, a, fiber, fuse, can, occur, the, reflection, from, the, damage, vaporizes, the, fiber, immediately, before, the, break, and, this, new, defect, remains, reflective, so, that, the, damage, propagates, back, toward, the, transmitter, at, 1, 3, meters, per, second, 4, 11, km, h, 2, 8, mph, the, open, fiber, control, system, which, ensures, laser, eye, safety, in, the, event, of, a, broken, fiber, can, also, effectively, halt, propagation, of, the, fiber, fuse, in, situations, such, as, undersea, cables, where, high, power, levels, might, be, used, without, the, need, for, open, fiber, control, a, fiber, fuse, protection, device, at, the, transmitter, can, break, the, circuit, to, keep, damage, to, a, minimum, the, refractive, index, of, fibers, varies, slightly, with, the, frequency, of, light, and, light, sources, are, not, perfectly, monochromatic, modulation, of, the, light, source, to, transmit, a, signal, also, slightly, widens, the, frequency, band, of, the, transmitted, light, this, has, the, effect, that, over, long, distances, and, at, high, modulation, speeds, the, different, frequencies, of, light, can, take, different, times, to, arrive, at, the, receiver, ultimately, making, the, signal, impossible, to, discern, and, requiring, extra, repeaters, this, problem, can, be, overcome, in, several, ways, including, the, use, of, a, relatively, short, length, of, fiber, that, has, the, opposite, refractive, index, gradient
