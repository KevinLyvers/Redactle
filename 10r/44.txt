an, electronic, calculator, is, typically, a, portable, electronic, device, used, to, perform, calculations, ranging, from, basic, arithmetic, to, complex, mathematics, the, first, solid, state, electronic, calculator, was, created, in, the, early, 1960s, pocket, sized, devices, became, available, in, the, 1970s, especially, after, the, intel, 4004, the, first, microprocessor, was, developed, by, intel, for, the, japanese, calculator, company, busicom, modern, electronic, calculators, vary, from, cheap, give, away, credit, card, sized, models, to, sturdy, desktop, models, with, built, in, printers, they, became, popular, in, the, mid, 1970s, as, the, incorporation, of, integrated, circuits, reduced, their, size, and, cost, by, the, end, of, that, decade, prices, had, dropped, to, the, point, where, a, basic, calculator, was, affordable, to, most, and, they, became, common, in, schools, computer, operating, systems, as, far, back, as, early, unix, have, included, interactive, calculator, programs, such, as, dc, and, hoc, and, interactive, basic, could, be, used, to, do, calculations, on, most, 1970s, and, 1980s, home, computers, calculator, functions, are, included, in, most, smartphones, tablets, and, personal, digital, assistant, pda, type, devices, in, addition, to, general, purpose, calculators, there, are, those, designed, for, specific, markets, for, example, there, are, scientific, calculators, which, include, trigonometric, and, statistical, calculations, some, calculators, even, have, the, ability, to, do, computer, algebra, graphing, calculators, can, be, used, to, graph, functions, defined, on, the, real, line, or, higher, dimensional, euclidean, space, as, of, 2016, basic, calculators, cost, little, but, scientific, and, graphing, models, tend, to, cost, more, with, the, very, wide, availability, of, smartphones, and, the, like, dedicated, hardware, calculators, while, still, widely, used, are, less, common, than, they, once, were, in, 1986, calculators, still, represented, an, estimated, 41, of, the, world, s, general, purpose, hardware, capacity, to, compute, information, by, 2007, this, had, diminished, to, less, than, 0, 05, electronic, calculators, contain, a, keyboard, with, buttons, for, digits, and, arithmetical, operations, some, even, contain, 00, and, 000, buttons, to, make, larger, or, smaller, numbers, easier, to, enter, most, basic, calculators, assign, only, one, digit, or, operation, on, each, button, however, in, more, specific, calculators, a, button, can, perform, multi, function, working, with, key, combinations, calculators, usually, have, liquid, crystal, displays, lcd, as, output, in, place, of, historical, light, emitting, diode, led, displays, and, vacuum, fluorescent, displays, vfd, details, are, provided, in, the, section, technical, improvements, large, sized, figures, are, often, used, to, improve, readability, while, using, decimal, separator, usually, a, point, rather, than, a, comma, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, vulgar, fractions, various, symbols, for, function, commands, may, also, be, shown, on, the, display, fractions, such, as, 1, 3, are, displayed, as, decimal, approximations, for, example, rounded, to, 0, 33333333, also, some, fractions, such, as, 1, 7, which, is, 0, 14285714285714, to, 14, significant, figures, can, be, difficult, to, recognize, in, decimal, form, as, a, result, many, scientific, calculators, are, able, to, work, in, vulgar, fractions, or, mixed, numbers, calculators, also, have, the, ability, to, save, numbers, into, computer, memory, basic, calculators, usually, store, only, one, number, at, a, time, more, specific, types, are, able, to, store, many, numbers, represented, in, variables, usually, these, variables, are, named, ans, or, ans, 0, the, variables, can, also, be, used, for, constructing, formulas, some, models, have, the, ability, to, extend, memory, capacity, to, store, more, numbers, the, extended, memory, address, is, termed, an, array, index, power, sources, of, calculators, are, batteries, solar, cells, or, mains, electricity, for, old, models, turning, on, with, a, switch, or, button, some, models, even, have, no, turn, off, button, but, they, provide, some, way, to, put, off, for, example, leaving, no, operation, for, a, moment, covering, solar, cell, exposure, or, closing, their, lid, crank, powered, calculators, were, also, common, in, the, early, computer, era, the, following, keys, are, common, to, most, pocket, calculators, while, the, arrangement, of, the, digits, is, standard, the, positions, of, other, keys, vary, from, model, to, model, the, illustration, is, an, example, the, arrangement, of, digits, on, calculator, and, other, numeric, keypads, with, the, 7, 8, 9, keys, two, rows, above, the, 1, 2, 3, keys, is, derived, from, calculators, and, cash, registers, it, is, notably, different, from, the, layout, of, telephone, touch, tone, keypads, which, have, the, 1, 2, 3, keys, on, top, and, 7, 8, 9, keys, on, the, third, row, in, general, a, basic, electronic, calculator, consists, of, the, following, components, clock, rate, of, a, processor, chip, refers, to, the, frequency, at, which, the, central, processing, unit, cpu, is, running, it, is, used, as, an, indicator, of, the, processor, s, speed, and, is, measured, in, clock, cycles, per, second, or, hertz, hz, for, basic, calculators, the, speed, can, vary, from, a, few, hundred, hertz, to, the, kilohertz, range, a, basic, explanation, as, to, how, calculations, are, performed, in, a, simple, four, function, calculator, to, perform, the, calculation, 25, 9, one, presses, keys, in, the, following, sequence, on, most, calculators, 2, 5, 9, other, functions, are, usually, performed, using, repeated, additions, or, subtractions, most, pocket, calculators, do, all, their, calculations, in, binary, coded, decimal, bcd, rather, than, binary, bcd, is, common, in, electronic, systems, where, a, numeric, value, is, to, be, displayed, especially, in, systems, consisting, solely, of, digital, logic, and, not, containing, a, microprocessor, by, employing, bcd, the, manipulation, of, numerical, data, for, display, can, be, greatly, simplified, by, treating, each, digit, as, a, separate, single, sub, circuit, this, matches, much, more, closely, the, physical, reality, of, display, hardware, a, designer, might, choose, to, use, a, series, of, separate, identical, seven, segment, displays, to, build, a, metering, circuit, for, example, if, the, numeric, quantity, were, stored, and, manipulated, as, pure, binary, interfacing, to, such, a, display, would, require, complex, circuitry, therefore, in, cases, where, the, calculations, are, relatively, simple, working, throughout, with, bcd, can, lead, to, a, simpler, overall, system, than, converting, to, and, from, binary, for, example, cds, keep, the, track, number, in, bcd, limiting, them, to, 99, tracks, the, same, argument, applies, when, hardware, of, this, type, uses, an, embedded, microcontroller, or, other, small, processor, often, smaller, code, results, when, representing, numbers, internally, in, bcd, format, since, a, conversion, from, or, to, binary, representation, can, be, expensive, on, such, limited, processors, for, these, applications, some, small, processors, feature, bcd, arithmetic, modes, which, assist, when, writing, routines, that, manipulate, bcd, quantities, where, calculators, have, added, functions, such, as, square, root, or, trigonometric, functions, software, algorithms, are, required, to, produce, high, precision, results, sometimes, significant, design, effort, is, needed, to, fit, all, the, desired, functions, in, the, limited, memory, space, available, in, the, calculator, chip, with, acceptable, calculation, time, the, first, known, tools, used, to, aid, arithmetic, calculations, were, bones, used, to, tally, items, pebbles, and, counting, boards, and, the, abacus, known, to, have, been, used, by, sumerians, and, egyptians, before, 2000, bc, except, for, the, antikythera, mechanism, an, out, of, the, time, astronomical, device, development, of, computing, tools, arrived, near, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, the, geometric, military, compass, by, galileo, logarithms, and, napier, bones, by, napier, and, the, slide, rule, by, edmund, gunter, the, renaissance, saw, the, invention, of, the, mechanical, calculator, by, wilhelm, schickard, in, 1623, and, later, by, blaise, pascal, in, 1642, a, device, that, was, at, times, somewhat, over, promoted, as, being, able, to, perform, all, four, arithmetic, operations, with, minimal, human, intervention, pascal, s, calculator, could, add, and, subtract, two, numbers, directly, and, thus, if, the, tedium, could, be, borne, multiply, and, divide, by, repetition, schickard, s, machine, constructed, several, decades, earlier, used, a, clever, set, of, mechanised, multiplication, tables, to, ease, the, process, of, multiplication, and, division, with, the, adding, machine, as, a, means, of, completing, this, operation, there, is, a, debate, about, whether, pascal, or, shickard, should, be, credited, as, the, known, inventor, of, a, calculating, machine, due, to, the, differences, like, the, different, aims, of, both, inventions, schickard, and, pascal, were, followed, by, gottfried, leibniz, who, spent, forty, years, designing, a, four, operation, mechanical, calculator, the, stepped, reckoner, inventing, in, the, process, his, leibniz, wheel, but, who, couldn, t, design, a, fully, operational, machine, there, were, also, five, unsuccessful, attempts, to, design, a, calculating, clock, in, the, 17th, century, the, 18th, century, saw, the, arrival, of, some, notable, improvements, first, by, poleni, with, the, first, fully, functional, calculating, clock, and, four, operation, machine, but, these, machines, were, almost, always, one, of, a, kind, luigi, torchi, invented, the, first, direct, multiplication, machine, in, 1834, this, was, also, the, second, key, driven, machine, in, the, world, following, that, of, james, white, 1822, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, and, the, industrial, revolution, that, real, developments, began, to, occur, although, machines, capable, of, performing, all, four, arithmetic, functions, existed, prior, to, the, 19th, century, the, refinement, of, manufacturing, and, fabrication, processes, during, the, eve, of, the, industrial, revolution, made, large, scale, production, of, more, compact, and, modern, units, possible, the, arithmometer, invented, in, 1820, as, a, four, operation, mechanical, calculator, was, released, to, production, in, 1851, as, an, adding, machine, and, became, the, first, commercially, successful, unit, forty, years, later, by, 1890, about, 2, 500, arithmometers, had, been, sold, plus, a, few, hundreds, more, from, two, arithmometer, clone, makers, burkhardt, germany, 1878, and, layton, uk, 1883, and, felt, and, tarrant, the, only, other, competitor, in, true, commercial, production, had, sold, 100, comptometers, it, wasn, t, until, 1902, that, the, familiar, push, button, user, interface, was, developed, with, the, introduction, of, the, dalton, adding, machine, developed, by, james, l, dalton, in, the, united, states, in, 1921, edith, clarke, invented, the, clarke, calculator, a, simple, graph, based, calculator, for, solving, line, equations, involving, hyperbolic, functions, this, allowed, electrical, engineers, to, simplify, calculations, for, inductance, and, capacitance, in, power, transmission, lines, the, curta, calculator, was, developed, in, 1948, and, although, costly, became, popular, for, its, portability, this, purely, mechanical, hand, held, device, could, do, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, division, by, the, early, 1970s, electronic, pocket, calculators, ended, manufacture, of, mechanical, calculators, although, the, curta, remains, a, popular, collectable, item, the, first, mainframe, computers, initially, using, vacuum, tubes, and, later, transistors, in, the, logic, circuits, appeared, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, electronic, circuits, developed, for, computers, also, had, application, to, electronic, calculators, the, casio, computer, company, in, japan, released, the, model, 14, a, calculator, in, 1957, which, was, the, world, s, first, all, electric, relatively, compact, calculator, it, did, not, use, electronic, logic, but, was, based, on, relay, technology, and, was, built, into, a, desk, the, ibm, 608, plugboard, programmable, calculator, was, ibm, s, first, all, transistor, product, released, in, 1957, this, was, a, console, type, system, with, input, and, output, on, punched, cards, and, replaced, the, earlier, larger, vacuum, tube, ibm, 603, in, october, 1961, the, world, s, first, all, electronic, desktop, calculator, the, british, bell, punch, sumlock, comptometer, anita, a, n, ew, i, nspiration, t, o, a, rithmetic, a, ccounting, was, announced, this, machine, used, vacuum, tubes, cold, cathode, tubes, and, dekatrons, in, its, circuits, with, 12, cold, cathode, nixie, tubes, for, its, display, two, models, were, displayed, the, mk, vii, for, continental, europe, and, the, mk, viii, for, britain, and, the, rest, of, the, world, both, for, delivery, from, early, 1962, the, mk, vii, was, a, slightly, earlier, design, with, a, more, complicated, mode, of, multiplication, and, was, soon, dropped, in, favour, of, the, simpler, mark, viii, the, anita, had, a, full, keyboard, similar, to, mechanical, comptometers, of, the, time, a, feature, that, was, unique, to, it, and, the, later, sharp, cs, 10a, among, electronic, calculators, the, anita, weighed, roughly, 33, pounds, 15, kg, due, to, its, large, tube, system, bell, punch, had, been, producing, key, driven, mechanical, calculators, of, the, comptometer, type, under, the, names, plus, and, sumlock, and, had, realised, in, the, mid, 1950s, that, the, future, of, calculators, lay, in, electronics, they, employed, the, young, graduate, norbert, kitz, who, had, worked, on, the, early, british, pilot, ace, computer, project, to, lead, the, development, the, anita, sold, well, since, it, was, the, only, electronic, desktop, calculator, available, and, was, silent, and, quick, the, tube, technology, of, the, anita, was, superseded, in, june, 1963, by, the, u, s, manufactured, friden, ec, 130, which, had, an, all, transistor, design, a, stack, of, four, 13, digit, numbers, displayed, on, a, 5, inch, 13, cm, cathode, ray, tube, crt, and, introduced, reverse, polish, notation, rpn, to, the, calculator, market, for, a, price, of, 2200, which, was, about, three, times, the, cost, of, an, electromechanical, calculator, of, the, time, like, bell, punch, friden, was, a, manufacturer, of, mechanical, calculators, that, had, decided, that, the, future, lay, in, electronics, in, 1964, more, all, transistor, electronic, calculators, were, introduced, sharp, introduced, the, cs, 10a, which, weighed, 25, kilograms, 55, lb, and, cost, 500, 000, yen, 4555, 81, and, industria, macchine, elettroniche, of, italy, introduced, the, ime, 84, to, which, several, extra, keyboard, and, display, units, could, be, connected, so, that, several, people, could, make, use, of, it, but, apparently, not, at, the, same, time, the, victor, 3900, was, the, first, to, use, integrated, circuits, in, place, of, individual, transistors, but, production, problems, delayed, sales, until, 1966, there, followed, a, series, of, electronic, calculator, models, from, these, and, other, manufacturers, including, canon, mathatronics, olivetti, scm, smith, corona, marchant, sony, toshiba, and, wang, the, early, calculators, used, hundreds, of, germanium, transistors, which, were, cheaper, than, silicon, transistors, on, multiple, circuit, boards, display, types, used, were, crt, cold, cathode, nixie, tubes, and, filament, lamps, memory, technology, was, usually, based, on, the, delay, line, memory, or, the, magnetic, core, memory, though, the, toshiba, toscal, bc, 1411, appears, to, have, used, an, early, form, of, dynamic, ram, built, from, discrete, components, already, there, was, a, desire, for, smaller, and, less, power, hungry, machines, bulgaria, s, elka, 6521, introduced, in, 1965, was, developed, by, the, central, institute, for, calculation, technologies, and, built, at, the, elektronika, factory, in, sofia, the, name, derives, from, el, ektronen, ka, lkulator, and, it, weighed, around, 8, kg, 18, lb, it, is, the, first, calculator, in, the, world, which, includes, the, square, root, function, later, that, same, year, were, released, the, elka, 22, with, a, luminescent, display, and, the, elka, 25, with, an, built, in, printer, several, other, models, were, developed, until, the, first, pocket, model, the, elka, 101, was, released, in, 1974, the, writing, on, it, was, in, roman, script, and, it, was, exported, to, western, countries, the, first, desktop, programmable, calculators, were, produced, in, the, mid, 1960s, they, included, the, mathatronics, mathatron, 1964, and, the, olivetti, programma, 101, late, 1965, which, were, solid, state, desktop, printing, floating, point, algebraic, entry, programmable, stored, program, electronic, calculators, both, could, be, programmed, by, the, end, user, and, print, out, their, results, the, programma, 101, saw, much, wider, distribution, and, had, the, added, feature, of, offline, storage, of, programs, via, magnetic, cards, another, early, programmable, desktop, calculator, and, maybe, the, first, japanese, one, was, the, casio, al, 1000, produced, in, 1967, it, featured, a, nixie, tubes, display, and, had, transistor, electronics, and, ferrite, core, memory, the, monroe, epic, programmable, calculator, came, on, the, market, in, 1967, a, large, printing, desk, top, unit, with, an, attached, floor, standing, logic, tower, it, could, be, programmed, to, perform, many, computer, like, functions, however, the, only, branch, instruction, was, an, implied, unconditional, branch, goto, at, the, end, of, the, operation, stack, returning, the, program, to, its, starting, instruction, thus, it, was, not, possible, to, include, any, conditional, branch, if, then, else, logic, during, this, era, the, absence, of, the, conditional, branch, was, sometimes, used, to, distinguish, a, programmable, calculator, from, a, computer, the, first, soviet, programmable, desktop, calculator, iskra, 123, powered, by, the, power, grid, was, released, at, the, start, of, the, 1970s, the, electronic, calculators, of, the, mid, 1960s, were, large, and, heavy, desktop, machines, due, to, their, use, of, hundreds, of, transistors, on, several, circuit, boards, with, a, large, power, consumption, that, required, an, ac, power, supply, there, were, great, efforts, to, put, the, logic, required, for, a, calculator, into, fewer, and, fewer, integrated, circuits, chips, and, calculator, electronics, was, one, of, the, leading, edges, of, semiconductor, development, u, s, semiconductor, manufacturers, led, the, world, in, large, scale, integration, lsi, semiconductor, development, squeezing, more, and, more, functions, into, individual, integrated, circuits, this, led, to, alliances, between, japanese, calculator, manufacturers, and, u, s, semiconductor, companies, canon, inc, with, texas, instruments, hayakawa, electric, later, renamed, sharp, corporation, with, north, american, rockwell, microelectronics, later, renamed, rockwell, international, busicom, with, mostek, and, intel, and, general, instrument, with, sanyo, by, 1970, a, calculator, could, be, made, using, just, a, few, chips, of, low, power, consumption, allowing, portable, models, powered, from, rechargeable, batteries, the, first, handheld, calculator, was, a, 1967, prototype, called, cal, tech, whose, development, was, led, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, in, a, research, project, to, produce, a, portable, calculator, it, could, add, multiply, subtract, and, divide, and, its, output, device, was, a, paper, tape, as, a, result, of, the, cal, tech, project, texas, instruments, was, granted, master, patents, on, portable, calculators, the, first, commercially, produced, portable, calculators, appeared, in, japan, in, 1970, and, were, soon, marketed, around, the, world, these, included, the, sanyo, icc, 0081, mini, calculator, the, canon, pocketronic, and, the, sharp, qt, 8b, micro, compet, the, canon, pocketronic, was, a, development, from, the, cal, tech, project, it, had, no, traditional, display, numerical, output, was, on, thermal, paper, tape, sharp, put, in, great, efforts, in, size, and, power, reduction, and, introduced, in, january, 1971, the, sharp, el, 8, also, marketed, as, the, facit, 1111, which, was, close, to, being, a, pocket, calculator, it, weighed, 1, 59, pounds, 721, grams, had, a, vacuum, fluorescent, display, rechargeable, nicad, batteries, and, initially, sold, for, us, 395, however, integrated, circuit, development, efforts, culminated, in, early, 1971, with, the, introduction, of, the, first, calculator, on, a, chip, the, mk6010, by, mostek, followed, by, texas, instruments, later, in, the, year, although, these, early, hand, held, calculators, were, very, costly, these, advances, in, electronics, together, with, developments, in, display, technology, such, as, the, vacuum, fluorescent, display, led, and, lcd, led, within, a, few, years, to, the, cheap, pocket, calculator, available, to, all, in, 1971, pico, electronics, and, general, instrument, also, introduced, their, first, collaboration, in, ics, a, full, single, chip, calculator, ic, for, the, monroe, royal, digital, iii, calculator, pico, was, a, spinout, by, five, gi, design, engineers, whose, vision, was, to, create, single, chip, calculator, ics, pico, and, gi, went, on, to, have, significant, success, in, the, burgeoning, handheld, calculator, market, the, first, truly, pocket, sized, electronic, calculator, was, the, busicom, le, 120a, handy, which, was, marketed, early, in, 1971, made, in, japan, this, was, also, the, first, calculator, to, use, an, led, display, the, first, hand, held, calculator, to, use, a, single, integrated, circuit, then, proclaimed, as, a, calculator, on, a, chip, the, mostek, mk6010, and, the, first, electronic, calculator, to, run, off, replaceable, batteries, using, four, aa, size, cells, the, le, 120a, measures, 4, 9, by, 2, 8, by, 0, 9, inches, 124, mm, 71, mm, 23, mm, the, first, european, made, pocket, sized, calculator, db, 800, was, made, in, may, 1971, by, digitron, in, buje, croatia, former, yugoslavia, with, four, functions, and, an, eight, digit, display, and, special, characters, for, a, negative, number, and, a, warning, that, the, calculation, has, too, many, digits, to, display, the, first, american, made, pocket, sized, calculator, the, bowmar, 901b, popularly, termed, the, bowmar, brain, measuring, 5, 2, by, 3, 0, by, 1, 5, inches, 132, mm, 76, mm, 38, mm, came, out, in, the, autumn, of, 1971, with, four, functions, and, an, eight, digit, red, led, display, for, us, 240, while, in, august, 1972, the, four, function, sinclair, executive, became, the, first, slimline, pocket, calculator, measuring, 5, 4, by, 2, 2, by, 0, 35, inches, 137, 2, mm, 55, 9, mm, 8, 9, mm, and, weighing, 2, 5, ounces, 71, g, it, retailed, for, around, 79, us, 194, at, the, time, by, the, end, of, the, decade, similar, calculators, were, priced, less, than, 5, 6, 85, following, protracted, development, over, the, course, of, two, years, including, a, botched, partnership, with, texas, instruments, eldorado, electrodata, released, five, pocket, calculators, in, 1972, one, called, the, touch, magic, was, no, bigger, than, a, pack, of, cigarettes, according, to, administrative, management, the, first, soviet, union, made, pocket, sized, calculator, the, elektronika, b3, 04, was, developed, by, the, end, of, 1973, and, sold, at, the, start, of, 1974, one, of, the, first, low, cost, calculators, was, the, sinclair, cambridge, launched, in, august, 1973, it, retailed, for, 29, 95, 41, 03, or, 5, 6, 85, less, in, kit, form, and, later, models, included, some, scientific, functions, the, sinclair, calculators, were, successful, because, they, were, far, cheaper, than, the, competition, however, their, design, led, to, slow, and, less, accurate, computations, of, transcendental, functions, maximum, three, decimal, places, of, accuracy, meanwhile, hewlett, packard, hp, had, been, developing, a, pocket, calculator, launched, in, early, 1972, it, was, unlike, the, other, basic, four, function, pocket, calculators, then, available, in, that, it, was, the, first, pocket, calculator, with, scientific, functions, that, could, replace, a, slide, rule, the, 395, hp, 35, along, with, nearly, all, later, hp, engineering, calculators, uses, reverse, polish, notation, rpn, also, called, postfix, notation, a, calculation, like, 8, plus, 5, is, using, rpn, performed, by, pressing, 8, enter, 5, and, instead, of, the, algebraic, infix, notation, 8, 5, it, had, 35, buttons, and, was, based, on, mostek, mk6020, chip, the, first, soviet, scientific, pocket, sized, calculator, the, b3, 18, was, completed, by, the, end, of, 1975, in, 1973, texas, instruments, ti, introduced, the, sr, 10, sr, signifying, slide, rule, an, algebraic, entry, pocket, calculator, using, scientific, notation, for, 150, shortly, after, the, sr, 11, featured, an, added, key, for, entering, pi, it, was, followed, the, next, year, by, the, sr, 50, which, added, log, and, trig, functions, to, compete, with, the, hp, 35, and, in, 1977, the, mass, marketed, ti, 30, line, which, is, still, produced, in, 1978, a, new, company, calculated, industries, arose, which, focused, on, specialized, markets, their, first, calculator, the, loan, arranger, 1978, was, a, pocket, calculator, marketed, to, the, real, estate, industry, with, preprogrammed, functions, to, simplify, the, process, of, calculating, payments, and, future, values, in, 1985, ci, launched, a, calculator, for, the, construction, industry, called, the, construction, master, which, came, preprogrammed, with, common, construction, calculations, such, as, angles, stairs, roofing, math, pitch, rise, run, and, feet, inch, fraction, conversions, this, would, be, the, first, in, a, line, of, construction, related, calculators, the, first, programmable, pocket, calculator, was, the, hp, 65, in, 1974, it, had, a, capacity, of, 100, instructions, and, could, store, and, retrieve, programs, with, a, built, in, magnetic, card, reader, two, years, later, the, hp, 25c, introduced, continuous, memory, i, e, programs, and, data, were, retained, in, cmos, memory, during, power, off, in, 1979, hp, released, the, first, alphanumeric, programmable, expandable, calculator, the, hp, 41, c, it, could, be, expanded, with, random, access, memory, ram, for, memory, and, read, only, memory, rom, for, software, modules, and, peripherals, like, bar, code, readers, microcassette, and, floppy, disk, drives, paper, roll, thermal, printers, and, miscellaneous, communication, interfaces, rs, 232, hp, il, hp, ib, the, first, soviet, pocket, battery, powered, programmable, calculator, elektronika, b3, 21, was, developed, by, the, end, of, 1976, and, released, at, the, start, of, 1977, the, successor, of, b3, 21, the, elektronika, b3, 34, wasn, t, backward, compatible, with, b3, 21, even, if, it, kept, the, reverse, polish, notation, rpn, thus, b3, 34, defined, a, new, command, set, which, later, was, used, in, a, series, of, later, programmable, soviet, calculators, despite, very, limited, abilities, 98, bytes, of, instruction, memory, and, about, 19, stack, and, addressable, registers, people, managed, to, write, all, kinds, of, programs, for, them, including, adventure, games, and, libraries, of, calculus, related, functions, for, engineers, hundreds, perhaps, thousands, of, programs, were, written, for, these, machines, from, practical, scientific, and, business, software, which, were, used, in, real, life, offices, and, labs, to, fun, games, for, children, the, elektronika, mk, 52, calculator, using, the, extended, b3, 34, command, set, and, featuring, internal, eeprom, memory, for, storing, programs, and, external, interface, for, eeprom, cards, and, other, periphery, was, used, in, soviet, spacecraft, program, for, soyuz, tm, 7, flight, as, a, backup, of, the, board, computer, this, series, of, calculators, was, also, noted, for, a, large, number, of, highly, counter, intuitive, mysterious, undocumented, features, somewhat, similar, to, synthetic, programming, of, the, american, hp, 41, which, were, exploited, by, applying, normal, arithmetic, operations, to, error, messages, jumping, to, nonexistent, addresses, and, other, methods, a, number, of, respected, monthly, publications, including, the, popular, science, magazine, nauka, i, zhizn, science, and, life, featured, special, columns, dedicated, to, optimization, methods, for, calculator, programmers, and, updates, on, undocumented, features, for, hackers, which, grew, into, a, whole, esoteric, science, with, many, branches, named, yeggogology, the, error, messages, on, those, calculators, appear, as, a, russian, word, yeggog, which, unsurprisingly, is, translated, to, error, a, similar, hacker, culture, in, the, us, revolved, around, the, hp, 41, which, was, also, noted, for, a, large, number, of, undocumented, features, and, was, much, more, powerful, than, b3, 34, through, the, 1970s, the, hand, held, electronic, calculator, underwent, rapid, development, the, red, led, and, blue, green, vacuum, fluorescent, displays, consumed, a, lot, of, power, and, the, calculators, either, had, a, short, battery, life, often, measured, in, hours, so, rechargeable, nickel, cadmium, batteries, were, common, or, were, large, so, that, they, could, take, larger, higher, capacity, batteries, in, the, early, 1970s, liquid, crystal, displays, lcds, were, in, their, infancy, and, there, was, a, great, deal, of, concern, that, they, only, had, a, short, operating, lifetime, busicom, introduced, the, busicom, le, 120a, handy, calculator, the, first, pocket, sized, calculator, and, the, first, with, an, led, display, and, announced, the, busicom, lc, with, lcd, however, there, were, problems, with, this, display, and, the, calculator, never, went, on, sale, the, first, successful, calculators, with, lcds, were, manufactured, by, rockwell, international, and, sold, from, 1972, by, other, companies, under, such, names, as, dataking, lc, 800, harden, dt, 12, ibico, 086, lloyds, 40, lloyds, 100, prismatic, 500, a, k, a, p500, rapid, data, rapidman, 1208lc, the, lcds, were, an, early, form, using, the, dynamic, scattering, mode, dsm, with, the, numbers, appearing, as, bright, against, a, dark, background, to, present, a, high, contrast, display, these, models, illuminated, the, lcd, using, a, filament, lamp, and, solid, plastic, light, guide, which, negated, the, low, power, consumption, of, the, display, these, models, appear, to, have, been, sold, only, for, a, year, or, two, a, more, successful, series, of, calculators, using, a, reflective, dsm, lcd, was, launched, in, 1972, by, sharp, inc, with, the, sharp, el, 805, which, was, a, slim, pocket, calculator, this, and, another, few, similar, models, used, sharp, s, calculator, on, substrate, cos, technology, an, extension, of, one, glass, plate, needed, for, the, liquid, crystal, display, was, used, as, a, substrate, to, mount, the, needed, chips, based, on, a, new, hybrid, technology, the, cos, technology, may, have, been, too, costly, since, it, was, only, used, in, a, few, models, before, sharp, reverted, to, conventional, circuit, boards, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, first, calculators, appeared, with, field, effect, twisted, nematic, tn, lcds, with, dark, numerals, against, a, grey, background, though, the, early, ones, often, had, a, yellow, filter, over, them, to, cut, out, damaging, ultraviolet, rays, the, advantage, of, lcds, is, that, they, are, passive, light, modulators, reflecting, light, which, require, much, less, power, than, light, emitting, displays, such, as, leds, or, vfds, this, led, the, way, to, the, first, credit, card, sized, calculators, such, as, the, casio, mini, card, lc, 78, of, 1978, which, could, run, for, months, of, normal, use, on, button, cells, there, were, also, improvements, to, the, electronics, inside, the, calculators, all, of, the, logic, functions, of, a, calculator, had, been, squeezed, into, the, first, calculator, on, a, chip, integrated, circuits, ics, in, 1971, but, this, was, leading, edge, technology, of, the, time, and, yields, were, low, and, costs, were, high, many, calculators, continued, to, use, two, or, more, ics, especially, the, scientific, and, the, programmable, ones, into, the, late, 1970s, the, power, consumption, of, the, integrated, circuits, was, also, reduced, especially, with, the, introduction, of, cmos, technology, appearing, in, the, sharp, el, 801, in, 1972, the, transistors, in, the, logic, cells, of, cmos, ics, only, used, any, appreciable, power, when, they, changed, state, the, led, and, vfd, displays, often, required, added, driver, transistors, or, ics, whereas, the, lcds, were, more, amenable, to, being, driven, directly, by, the, calculator, ic, itself, with, this, low, power, consumption, came, the, possibility, of, using, solar, cells, as, the, power, source, realised, around, 1978, by, calculators, such, as, the, royal, solar, 1, sharp, el, 8026, and, teal, photon, at, the, start, of, the, 1970s, hand, held, electronic, calculators, were, very, costly, at, two, or, three, weeks, wages, and, so, were, a, luxury, item, the, high, price, was, due, to, their, construction, requiring, many, mechanical, and, electronic, components, which, were, costly, to, produce, and, production, runs, that, were, too, small, to, exploit, economies, of, scale, many, firms, saw, that, there, were, good, profits, to, be, made, in, the, calculator, business, with, the, margin, on, such, high, prices, however, the, cost, of, calculators, fell, as, components, and, their, production, methods, improved, and, the, effect, of, economies, of, scale, was, felt, by, 1976, the, cost, of, the, cheapest, four, function, pocket, calculator, had, dropped, to, a, few, dollars, about, 1, 20, of, the, cost, five, years, before, the, results, of, this, were, that, the, pocket, calculator, was, affordable, and, that, it, was, now, difficult, for, the, manufacturers, to, make, a, profit, from, calculators, leading, to, many, firms, dropping, out, of, the, business, or, closing, the, firms, that, survived, making, calculators, tended, to, be, those, with, high, outputs, of, higher, quality, calculators, or, producing, high, specification, scientific, and, programmable, calculators, the, first, calculator, capable, of, symbolic, computing, was, the, hp, 28c, released, in, 1987, it, could, for, example, solve, quadratic, equations, symbolically, the, first, graphing, calculator, was, the, casio, fx, 7000g, released, in, 1985, the, two, leading, manufacturers, hp, and, ti, released, increasingly, feature, laden, calculators, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, at, the, turn, of, the, millennium, the, line, between, a, graphing, calculator, and, a, handheld, computer, was, not, always, clear, as, some, very, advanced, calculators, such, as, the, ti, 89, the, voyage, 200, and, hp, 49g, could, differentiate, and, integrate, functions, solve, differential, equations, run, word, processing, and, pim, software, and, connect, by, wire, or, ir, to, other, calculators, computers, the, hp, 12c, financial, calculator, is, still, produced, it, was, introduced, in, 1981, and, is, still, being, made, with, few, changes, the, hp, 12c, featured, the, reverse, polish, notation, mode, of, data, entry, in, 2003, several, new, models, were, released, including, an, improved, version, of, the, hp, 12c, the, hp, 12c, platinum, edition, which, added, more, memory, more, built, in, functions, and, the, addition, of, the, algebraic, mode, of, data, entry, calculated, industries, competed, with, the, hp, 12c, in, the, mortgage, and, real, estate, markets, by, differentiating, the, key, labeling, changing, the, i, pv, fv, to, easier, labeling, terms, such, as, int, term, pmt, and, not, using, the, reverse, polish, notation, however, ci, s, more, successful, calculators, involved, a, line, of, construction, calculators, which, evolved, and, expanded, in, the, 1990s, to, present, according, to, mark, bollman, a, mathematics, and, calculator, historian, and, associate, professor, of, mathematics, at, albion, college, the, construction, master, is, the, first, in, a, long, and, profitable, line, of, ci, construction, calculators, which, carried, them, through, the, 1980s, 1990s, and, to, the, present, in, most, countries, students, use, calculators, for, schoolwork, there, was, some, initial, resistance, to, the, idea, out, of, fear, that, basic, or, elementary, arithmetic, skills, would, suffer, there, remains, disagreement, about, the, importance, of, the, ability, to, perform, calculations, in, the, head, with, some, curricula, restricting, calculator, use, until, a, certain, level, of, proficiency, has, been, obtained, while, others, concentrate, more, on, teaching, estimation, methods, and, problem, solving, research, suggests, that, inadequate, guidance, in, the, use, of, calculating, tools, can, restrict, the, kind, of, mathematical, thinking, that, students, engage, in, others, have, argued, that, calculator, use, can, even, cause, core, mathematical, skills, to, atrophy, or, that, such, use, can, prevent, understanding, of, advanced, algebraic, concepts, in, december, 2011, the, uk, s, minister, of, state, for, schools, nick, gibb, voiced, concern, that, children, can, become, too, dependent, on, the, use, of, calculators, as, a, result, the, use, of, calculators, is, to, be, included, as, part, of, a, review, of, the, curriculum, in, the, united, states, many, math, educators, and, boards, of, education, have, enthusiastically, endorsed, the, national, council, of, teachers, of, mathematics, nctm, standards, and, actively, promoted, the, use, of, classroom, calculators, from, kindergarten, through, high, school, personal, computers, often, come, with, a, calculator, utility, program, that, emulates, the, appearance, and, functions, of, a, calculator, using, the, graphical, user, interface, to, portray, a, calculator, examples, include, the, windows, calculator, apple, s, calculator, and, kde, s, kcalc, most, personal, data, assistants, pdas, and, smartphones, also, have, such, a, feature, the, fundamental, difference, between, a, calculator, and, computer, is, that, a, computer, can, be, programmed, in, a, way, that, allows, the, program, to, take, different, branches, according, to, intermediate, results, while, calculators, are, pre, designed, with, specific, functions, such, as, addition, multiplication, and, logarithms, built, in, the, distinction, is, not, clear, cut, some, devices, classed, as, programmable, calculators, have, programming, functions, sometimes, with, support, for, programming, languages, such, as, rpl, or, ti, basic, for, instance, instead, of, a, hardware, multiplier, a, calculator, might, implement, floating, point, mathematics, with, code, in, read, only, memory, rom, and, compute, trigonometric, functions, with, the, cordic, algorithm, because, cordic, does, not, require, much, multiplication, bit, serial, logic, designs, are, more, common, in, calculators, whereas, bit, parallel, designs, dominate, general, purpose, computers, because, a, bit, serial, design, minimizes, chip, complexity, but, takes, many, more, clock, cycles, this, distinction, blurs, with, high, end, calculators, which, use, processor, chips, associated, with, computer, and, embedded, systems, design, more, so, the, z80, mc68000, and, arm, architectures, and, some, custom, designs, specialized, for, the, calculator, market
