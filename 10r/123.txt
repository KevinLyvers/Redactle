signal, to, noise, ratio, snr, or, s, n, is, a, measure, used, in, science, and, engineering, that, compares, the, level, of, a, desired, signal, to, the, level, of, background, noise, snr, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, signal, power, to, noise, power, often, expressed, in, decibels, a, ratio, higher, than, 1, 1, greater, than, 0, db, indicates, more, signal, than, noise, snr, is, an, important, parameter, that, affects, the, performance, and, quality, of, systems, that, process, or, transmit, signals, such, as, communication, systems, audio, systems, radar, systems, imaging, systems, and, data, acquisition, systems, a, high, snr, means, that, the, signal, is, clear, and, easy, to, detect, or, interpret, while, a, low, snr, means, that, the, signal, is, corrupted, or, obscured, by, noise, and, may, be, difficult, to, distinguish, or, recover, snr, can, be, improved, by, various, methods, such, as, increasing, the, signal, strength, reducing, the, noise, level, filtering, out, unwanted, noise, or, using, error, correction, techniques, snr, also, determines, the, maximum, possible, amount, of, data, that, can, be, transmitted, reliably, over, a, given, channel, which, depends, on, its, bandwidth, and, snr, this, relationship, is, described, by, the, shannon, hartley, theorem, which, is, a, fundamental, law, of, information, theory, snr, can, be, calculated, using, different, formulas, depending, on, how, the, signal, and, noise, are, measured, and, defined, the, most, common, way, to, express, snr, is, in, decibels, which, is, a, logarithmic, scale, that, makes, it, easier, to, compare, large, or, small, values, other, definitions, of, snr, may, use, different, factors, or, bases, for, the, logarithm, depending, on, the, context, and, application, one, definition, of, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, the, power, of, a, signal, meaningful, input, to, the, power, of, background, noise, meaningless, or, unwanted, input, where, p, is, average, power, both, signal, and, noise, power, must, be, measured, at, the, same, or, equivalent, points, in, a, system, and, within, the, same, system, bandwidth, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, of, a, random, variable, s, to, random, noise, n, is, s, n, r, e, s, 2, e, n, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, snr, frac, mathrm, e, mathrm, e, where, e, refers, to, the, expected, value, which, in, this, case, is, the, mean, square, of, n, if, the, signal, is, simply, a, constant, value, of, s, this, equation, simplifies, to, s, n, r, s, 2, e, n, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, snr, frac, s, 2, mathrm, e, if, the, noise, has, expected, value, of, zero, as, is, common, the, denominator, is, its, variance, the, square, of, its, standard, deviation, n, the, signal, and, the, noise, must, be, measured, the, same, way, for, example, as, voltages, across, the, same, impedance, their, root, mean, squares, can, alternatively, be, used, according, to, where, a, is, root, mean, square, rms, amplitude, for, example, rms, voltage, because, many, signals, have, a, very, wide, dynamic, range, signals, are, often, expressed, using, the, logarithmic, decibel, scale, based, upon, the, definition, of, decibel, signal, and, noise, may, be, expressed, in, decibels, db, as, and, in, a, similar, manner, snr, may, be, expressed, in, decibels, as, using, the, definition, of, snr, using, the, quotient, rule, for, logarithms, substituting, the, definitions, of, snr, signal, and, noise, in, decibels, into, the, above, equation, results, in, an, important, formula, for, calculating, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, in, decibels, when, the, signal, and, noise, are, also, in, decibels, in, the, above, formula, p, is, measured, in, units, of, power, such, as, watts, w, or, milliwatts, mw, and, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, a, pure, number, however, when, the, signal, and, noise, are, measured, in, volts, v, or, amperes, a, which, are, measures, of, amplitude, they, must, first, be, squared, to, obtain, a, quantity, proportional, to, power, as, shown, below, the, concepts, of, signal, to, noise, ratio, and, dynamic, range, are, closely, related, dynamic, range, measures, the, ratio, between, the, strongest, un, distorted, signal, on, a, channel, and, the, minimum, discernible, signal, which, for, most, purposes, is, the, noise, level, snr, measures, the, ratio, between, an, arbitrary, signal, level, not, necessarily, the, most, powerful, signal, possible, and, noise, measuring, signal, to, noise, ratios, requires, the, selection, of, a, representative, or, reference, signal, in, audio, engineering, the, reference, signal, is, usually, a, sine, wave, at, a, standardized, nominal, or, alignment, level, such, as, 1, khz, at, 4, dbu, 1, 228, v, rms, snr, is, usually, taken, to, indicate, an, average, signal, to, noise, ratio, as, it, is, possible, that, instantaneous, signal, to, noise, ratios, will, be, considerably, different, the, concept, can, be, understood, as, normalizing, the, noise, level, to, 1, 0, db, and, measuring, how, far, the, signal, stands, out, in, physics, the, average, power, of, an, ac, signal, is, defined, as, the, average, value, of, voltage, times, current, for, resistive, non, reactive, circuits, where, voltage, and, current, are, in, phase, this, is, equivalent, to, the, product, of, the, rms, voltage, and, current, but, in, signal, processing, and, communication, one, usually, assumes, that, r, 1, displaystyle, r, 1, omega, so, that, factor, is, usually, not, included, while, measuring, power, or, energy, of, a, signal, this, may, cause, some, confusion, among, readers, but, the, resistance, factor, is, not, significant, for, typical, operations, performed, in, signal, processing, or, for, computing, power, ratios, for, most, cases, the, power, of, a, signal, would, be, considered, to, be, simply, an, alternative, definition, of, snr, is, as, the, reciprocal, of, the, coefficient, of, variation, i, e, the, ratio, of, mean, to, standard, deviation, of, a, signal, or, measurement, where, displaystyle, mu, is, the, signal, mean, or, expected, value, and, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, standard, deviation, of, the, noise, or, an, estimate, thereof, notice, that, such, an, alternative, definition, is, only, useful, for, variables, that, are, always, non, negative, such, as, photon, counts, and, luminance, and, it, is, only, an, approximation, since, e, x, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, operatorname, e, left, sigma, 2, mu, 2, it, is, commonly, used, in, image, processing, where, the, snr, of, an, image, is, usually, calculated, as, the, ratio, of, the, mean, pixel, value, to, the, standard, deviation, of, the, pixel, values, over, a, given, neighborhood, sometimes, snr, is, defined, as, the, square, of, the, alternative, definition, above, in, which, case, it, is, equivalent, to, the, more, common, definition, this, definition, is, closely, related, to, the, sensitivity, index, or, d, when, assuming, that, the, signal, has, two, states, separated, by, signal, amplitude, displaystyle, mu, and, the, noise, standard, deviation, displaystyle, sigma, does, not, change, between, the, two, states, the, rose, criterion, named, after, albert, rose, states, that, an, snr, of, at, least, 5, is, needed, to, be, able, to, distinguish, image, features, with, certainty, an, snr, less, than, 5, means, less, than, 100, certainty, in, identifying, image, details, yet, another, alternative, very, specific, and, distinct, definition, of, snr, is, employed, to, characterize, sensitivity, of, imaging, systems, see, signal, to, noise, ratio, imaging, related, measures, are, the, contrast, ratio, and, the, contrast, to, noise, ratio, channel, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, given, by, where, w, is, the, bandwidth, and, k, a, displaystyle, k, a, is, modulation, index, output, signal, to, noise, ratio, of, am, receiver, is, given, by, channel, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, given, by, output, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, given, by, all, real, measurements, are, disturbed, by, noise, this, includes, electronic, noise, but, can, also, include, external, events, that, affect, the, measured, phenomenon, wind, vibrations, the, gravitational, attraction, of, the, moon, variations, of, temperature, variations, of, humidity, etc, depending, on, what, is, measured, and, of, the, sensitivity, of, the, device, it, is, often, possible, to, reduce, the, noise, by, controlling, the, environment, internal, electronic, noise, of, measurement, systems, can, be, reduced, through, the, use, of, low, noise, amplifiers, when, the, characteristics, of, the, noise, are, known, and, are, different, from, the, signal, it, is, possible, to, use, a, filter, to, reduce, the, noise, for, example, a, lock, in, amplifier, can, extract, a, narrow, bandwidth, signal, from, broadband, noise, a, million, times, stronger, when, the, signal, is, constant, or, periodic, and, the, noise, is, random, it, is, possible, to, enhance, the, snr, by, averaging, the, measurements, in, this, case, the, noise, goes, down, as, the, square, root, of, the, number, of, averaged, samples, when, a, measurement, is, digitized, the, number, of, bits, used, to, represent, the, measurement, determines, the, maximum, possible, signal, to, noise, ratio, this, is, because, the, minimum, possible, noise, level, is, the, error, caused, by, the, quantization, of, the, signal, sometimes, called, quantization, noise, this, noise, level, is, non, linear, and, signal, dependent, different, calculations, exist, for, different, signal, models, quantization, noise, is, modeled, as, an, analog, error, signal, summed, with, the, signal, before, quantization, additive, noise, this, theoretical, maximum, snr, assumes, a, perfect, input, signal, if, the, input, signal, is, already, noisy, as, is, usually, the, case, the, signal, s, noise, may, be, larger, than, the, quantization, noise, real, analog, to, digital, converters, also, have, other, sources, of, noise, that, further, decrease, the, snr, compared, to, the, theoretical, maximum, from, the, idealized, quantization, noise, including, the, intentional, addition, of, dither, although, noise, levels, in, a, digital, system, can, be, expressed, using, snr, it, is, more, common, to, use, e, b, n, o, the, energy, per, bit, per, noise, power, spectral, density, the, modulation, error, ratio, mer, is, a, measure, of, the, snr, in, a, digitally, modulated, signal, for, n, bit, integers, with, equal, distance, between, quantization, levels, uniform, quantization, the, dynamic, range, dr, is, also, determined, assuming, a, uniform, distribution, of, input, signal, values, the, quantization, noise, is, a, uniformly, distributed, random, signal, with, a, peak, to, peak, amplitude, of, one, quantization, level, making, the, amplitude, ratio, 2, n, 1, the, formula, is, then, this, relationship, is, the, origin, of, statements, like, 16, bit, audio, has, a, dynamic, range, of, 96, db, each, extra, quantization, bit, increases, the, dynamic, range, by, roughly, 6, db, assuming, a, full, scale, sine, wave, signal, that, is, the, quantizer, is, designed, such, that, it, has, the, same, minimum, and, maximum, values, as, the, input, signal, the, quantization, noise, approximates, a, sawtooth, wave, with, peak, to, peak, amplitude, of, one, quantization, level, and, uniform, distribution, in, this, case, the, snr, is, approximately, floating, point, numbers, provide, a, way, to, trade, off, signal, to, noise, ratio, for, an, increase, in, dynamic, range, for, n, bit, floating, point, numbers, with, n, m, bits, in, the, mantissa, and, m, bits, in, the, exponent, the, dynamic, range, is, much, larger, than, fixed, point, but, at, a, cost, of, a, worse, signal, to, noise, ratio, this, makes, floating, point, preferable, in, situations, where, the, dynamic, range, is, large, or, unpredictable, fixed, point, s, simpler, implementations, can, be, used, with, no, signal, quality, disadvantage, in, systems, where, dynamic, range, is, less, than, 6, 02m, the, very, large, dynamic, range, of, floating, point, can, be, a, disadvantage, since, it, requires, more, forethought, in, designing, algorithms, optical, signals, have, a, carrier, frequency, about, 200, thz, and, more, that, is, much, higher, than, the, modulation, frequency, this, way, the, noise, covers, a, bandwidth, that, is, much, wider, than, the, signal, itself, the, resulting, signal, influence, relies, mainly, on, the, filtering, of, the, noise, to, describe, the, signal, quality, without, taking, the, receiver, into, account, the, optical, snr, osnr, is, used, the, osnr, is, the, ratio, between, the, signal, power, and, the, noise, power, in, a, given, bandwidth, most, commonly, a, reference, bandwidth, of, 0, 1, nm, is, used, this, bandwidth, is, independent, of, the, modulation, format, the, frequency, and, the, receiver, for, instance, an, osnr, of, 20, db, 0, 1, nm, could, be, given, even, the, signal, of, 40, gbit, dpsk, would, not, fit, in, this, bandwidth, osnr, is, measured, with, an, optical, spectrum, analyzer, signal, to, noise, ratio, may, be, abbreviated, as, snr, and, less, commonly, as, s, n, psnr, stands, for, peak, signal, to, noise, ratio, gsnr, stands, for, geometric, signal, to, noise, ratio, sinr, is, the, signal, to, interference, plus, noise, ratio, while, snr, is, commonly, quoted, for, electrical, signals, it, can, be, applied, to, any, form, of, signal, for, example, isotope, levels, in, an, ice, core, biochemical, signaling, between, cells, or, financial, trading, signals, the, term, is, sometimes, used, metaphorically, to, refer, to, the, ratio, of, useful, information, to, false, or, irrelevant, data, in, a, conversation, or, exchange, for, example, in, online, discussion, forums, and, other, online, communities, off, topic, posts, and, spam, are, regarded, as, noise, that, interferes, with, the, signal, of, appropriate, discussion, snr, can, also, be, applied, in, marketing, and, how, business, professionals, manage, information, overload, managing, a, healthy, signal, to, noise, ratio, can, help, business, executives, improve, their, kpis, key, performance, indicators, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, similar, to, cohen, s, d, given, by, the, difference, of, estimated, means, divided, by, the, standard, deviation, of, the, data, d, x, 1, x, 2, sd, x, 1, x, 2, t, n, displaystyle, d, frac, bar, x, 1, bar, x, 2, text, sd, frac, bar, x, 1,
