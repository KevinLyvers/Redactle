an, astronaut, from, the, ancient, greek, astron, meaning, star, and, nautes, meaning, sailor, is, a, person, trained, equipped, and, deployed, by, a, human, spaceflight, program, to, serve, as, a, commander, or, crew, member, aboard, a, spacecraft, although, generally, reserved, for, professional, space, travelers, the, term, is, sometimes, applied, to, anyone, who, travels, into, space, including, scientists, politicians, journalists, and, tourists, astronaut, technically, applies, to, all, human, space, travelers, regardless, of, nationality, however, astronauts, fielded, by, russia, or, the, soviet, union, are, typically, known, instead, as, cosmonauts, from, the, russian, kosmos, meaning, space, also, borrowed, from, greek, comparatively, recent, developments, in, crewed, spaceflight, made, by, china, have, led, to, the, rise, of, the, term, taikonaut, from, the, mandarin, t, ik, ng, meaning, space, although, its, use, is, somewhat, informal, and, its, origin, is, unclear, in, china, the, people, s, liberation, army, astronaut, corps, astronauts, and, their, foreign, counterparts, are, all, officially, called, h, ngti, nyu, n, meaning, heaven, navigator, or, literally, heaven, sailing, staff, since, 1961, 600, astronauts, have, flown, in, space, until, 2002, astronauts, were, sponsored, and, trained, exclusively, by, governments, either, by, the, military, or, by, civilian, space, agencies, with, the, suborbital, flight, of, the, privately, funded, spaceshipone, in, 2004, a, new, category, of, astronaut, was, created, the, commercial, astronaut, the, criteria, for, what, constitutes, human, spaceflight, vary, with, some, focus, on, the, point, where, the, atmosphere, becomes, so, thin, that, centrifugal, force, rather, than, aerodynamic, force, carries, a, significant, portion, of, the, weight, of, the, flight, object, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, fai, sporting, code, for, astronautics, recognizes, only, flights, that, exceed, the, k, rm, n, line, at, an, altitude, of, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, in, the, united, states, professional, military, and, commercial, astronauts, who, travel, above, an, altitude, of, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, are, awarded, astronaut, wings, as, of, 17, november, 2016, 552, people, from, 36, countries, have, reached, 100, km, 62, mi, or, more, in, altitude, of, whom, 549, reached, low, earth, orbit, or, beyond, of, these, 24, people, have, traveled, beyond, low, earth, orbit, either, to, lunar, orbit, the, lunar, surface, or, in, one, case, a, loop, around, the, moon, three, of, the, 24, jim, lovell, john, young, and, eugene, cernan, did, so, twice, as, of, 17, november, 2016, under, the, u, s, definition, 558, people, qualify, as, having, reached, space, above, 50, miles, 80, km, altitude, of, eight, x, 15, pilots, who, exceeded, 50, miles, 80, km, in, altitude, only, one, joseph, a, walker, exceeded, 100, kilometers, about, 62, 1, miles, and, he, did, it, two, times, becoming, the, first, person, in, space, twice, space, travelers, have, spent, over, 41, 790, man, days, 114, 5, man, years, in, space, including, over, 100, astronaut, days, of, spacewalks, as, of, 2024, the, man, with, the, longest, cumulative, time, in, space, is, oleg, kononenko, who, has, spent, over, 1100, days, in, space, peggy, a, whitson, holds, the, record, for, the, most, time, in, space, by, a, woman, at, 675, days, in, 1959, when, both, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, were, planning, but, had, yet, to, launch, humans, into, space, nasa, administrator, t, keith, glennan, and, his, deputy, administrator, hugh, dryden, discussed, whether, spacecraft, crew, members, should, be, called, astronauts, or, cosmonauts, dryden, preferred, cosmonaut, on, the, grounds, that, flights, would, occur, in, and, to, the, broader, cosmos, while, the, astro, prefix, suggested, flight, specifically, to, the, stars, most, nasa, space, task, group, members, preferred, astronaut, which, survived, by, common, usage, as, the, preferred, american, term, when, the, soviet, union, launched, the, first, man, into, space, yuri, gagarin, in, 1961, they, chose, a, term, which, anglicizes, to, cosmonaut, a, professional, space, traveler, is, called, an, astronaut, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, astronaut, in, the, modern, sense, was, by, neil, r, jones, in, his, 1930, short, story, the, death, s, head, meteor, the, word, itself, had, been, known, earlier, for, example, in, percy, greg, s, 1880, book, across, the, zodiac, astronaut, referred, to, a, spacecraft, in, les, navigateurs, de, l, infini, 1925, by, j, h, rosny, a, n, the, word, astronautique, astronautics, was, used, the, word, may, have, been, inspired, by, aeronaut, an, older, term, for, an, air, traveler, first, applied, in, 1784, to, balloonists, an, early, use, of, astronaut, in, a, non, fiction, publication, is, eric, frank, russell, s, poem, the, astronaut, appearing, in, the, november, 1934, bulletin, of, the, british, interplanetary, society, the, first, known, formal, use, of, the, term, astronautics, in, the, scientific, community, was, the, establishment, of, the, annual, international, astronautical, congress, in, 1950, and, the, subsequent, founding, of, the, international, astronautical, federation, the, following, year, nasa, applies, the, term, astronaut, to, any, crew, member, aboard, nasa, spacecraft, bound, for, earth, orbit, or, beyond, nasa, also, uses, the, term, as, a, title, for, those, selected, to, join, its, astronaut, corps, the, european, space, agency, similarly, uses, the, term, astronaut, for, members, of, its, astronaut, corps, by, convention, an, astronaut, employed, by, the, russian, federal, space, agency, or, its, predecessor, the, soviet, space, program, is, called, a, cosmonaut, in, english, texts, the, word, is, an, anglicization, of, kosmonavt, russian, russian, pronunciation, other, countries, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, use, variations, of, the, russian, kosmonavt, such, as, the, polish, kosmonauta, although, poles, also, used, astronauta, and, the, two, words, are, considered, synonyms, coinage, of, the, term, has, been, credited, to, soviet, aeronautics, or, cosmonautics, pioneer, mikhail, tikhonravov, 1900, 1974, the, first, cosmonaut, was, soviet, air, force, pilot, yuri, gagarin, also, the, first, person, in, space, he, was, part, of, the, first, six, soviet, citizens, with, german, titov, yevgeny, khrunov, andriyan, nikolayev, pavel, popovich, and, grigoriy, nelyubov, who, were, given, the, title, of, pilot, cosmonaut, in, january, 1961, valentina, tereshkova, was, the, first, female, cosmonaut, and, the, first, and, youngest, woman, to, have, flown, in, space, with, a, solo, mission, on, the, vostok, 6, in, 1963, on, 14, march, 1995, norman, thagard, became, the, first, american, to, ride, to, space, on, board, a, russian, launch, vehicle, and, thus, became, the, first, american, cosmonaut, in, chinese, the, term, y, h, ng, yu, n, cosmos, navigating, personnel, is, used, for, astronauts, and, cosmonauts, in, general, while, h, ngti, n, yu, n, navigating, celestial, heaven, personnel, is, used, for, chinese, astronauts, here, h, ngti, n, literally, heaven, navigating, or, spaceflight, is, strictly, defined, as, the, navigation, of, outer, space, within, the, local, star, system, i, e, solar, system, the, phrase, t, ik, ng, r, n, spaceman, is, often, used, in, hong, kong, and, taiwan, the, term, taikonaut, is, used, by, some, english, language, news, media, organizations, for, professional, space, travelers, from, china, the, word, has, featured, in, the, longman, and, oxford, english, dictionaries, and, the, term, became, more, common, in, 2003, when, china, sent, its, first, astronaut, yang, liwei, into, space, aboard, the, shenzhou, 5, spacecraft, this, is, the, term, used, by, xinhua, news, agency, in, the, english, version, of, the, chinese, people, s, daily, since, the, advent, of, the, chinese, space, program, the, origin, of, the, term, is, unclear, as, early, as, may, 1998, chiew, lee, yih, from, malaysia, used, it, in, newsgroups, for, its, 2022, astronaut, group, the, european, space, agency, envisioned, recruiting, an, astronaut, with, a, physical, disability, a, category, they, called, parastronauts, with, the, intention, but, not, guarantee, of, spaceflight, the, categories, of, disability, considered, for, the, program, were, individuals, with, lower, limb, deficiency, either, through, amputation, or, congenital, leg, length, difference, or, a, short, stature, less, than, 130, centimetres, or, 4, feet, 3, inches, on, 23, november, 2022, john, mcfall, was, selected, to, be, the, first, esa, parastronaut, with, the, rise, of, space, tourism, nasa, and, the, russian, federal, space, agency, agreed, to, use, the, term, spaceflight, participant, to, distinguish, those, space, travelers, from, professional, astronauts, on, missions, coordinated, by, those, two, agencies, while, no, nation, other, than, russia, and, previously, the, soviet, union, the, united, states, and, china, have, launched, a, crewed, spacecraft, several, other, nations, have, sent, people, into, space, in, cooperation, with, one, of, these, countries, e, g, the, soviet, led, interkosmos, program, inspired, partly, by, these, missions, other, synonyms, for, astronaut, have, entered, occasional, english, usage, for, example, the, term, spationaut, french, spationaute, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, french, space, travelers, from, the, latin, word, spatium, for, space, the, malay, term, angkasawan, deriving, from, angkasa, meaning, space, was, used, to, describe, participants, in, the, angkasawan, program, note, its, similarity, with, the, indonesian, term, antariksawan, plans, of, the, indian, space, research, organisation, to, launch, its, crewed, gaganyaan, spacecraft, have, spurred, at, times, public, discussion, if, another, term, than, astronaut, should, be, used, for, the, crew, members, suggesting, vyomanaut, from, the, sanskrit, word, vyoman, meaning, sky, or, space, or, gagannaut, from, the, sanskrit, word, gagan, for, sky, in, finland, the, nasa, astronaut, timothy, kopra, a, finnish, american, has, sometimes, been, referred, to, as, sisunautti, from, the, finnish, word, sisu, across, germanic, languages, the, word, for, astronaut, typically, translates, to, space, traveler, as, it, does, with, german, s, raumfahrer, dutch, s, ruimtevaarder, swedish, s, rymdfarare, and, norwegian, s, romfarer, as, of, 2021, in, the, united, states, astronaut, status, is, conferred, on, a, person, depending, on, the, authorizing, agency, on, july, 20, 2021, the, faa, issued, an, order, redefining, the, eligibility, criteria, to, be, an, astronaut, in, response, to, the, private, suborbital, spaceflights, of, jeff, bezos, and, richard, branson, the, new, criteria, states, that, one, must, have, emonstrated, activities, during, flight, that, were, essential, to, public, safety, or, contributed, to, human, space, flight, safety, to, qualify, as, an, astronaut, this, new, definition, excludes, bezos, and, branson, the, first, human, in, space, was, soviet, yuri, gagarin, who, was, launched, on, 12, april, 1961, aboard, vostok, 1, and, orbited, around, the, earth, for, 108, minutes, the, first, woman, in, space, was, soviet, valentina, tereshkova, who, launched, on, 16, june, 1963, aboard, vostok, 6, and, orbited, earth, for, almost, three, days, alan, shepard,

nasa, astronauts, were, selected, for, training, in, 1959, early, in, the, space, program, military, jet, test, piloting, and, engineering, training, were, often, cited, as, prerequisites, for, selection, as, an, astronaut, at, nasa, although, neither, john, glenn, nor, scott, carpenter, of, the, mercury, seven, had, any, university, degree, in, engineering, or, any, other, discipline, at, the, time, of, their, selection, selection, was, initially, limited, to, military, pilots, the, earliest, astronauts, for, both, the, us, and, the, ussr, tended, to, be, jet, fighter, pilots, and, were, often, test, pilots, once, selected, nasa, astronauts, go, through, twenty, months, of, training, in, a, variety, of, areas, including, training, for, extravehicular, activity, in, a, facility, such, as, nasa, s, neutral, buoyancy, laboratory, astronauts, in, training, astronaut, candidates, may, also, experience, short, periods, of, weightlessness, microgravity, in, an, aircraft, called, the, vomit, comet, the, nickname, given, to, a, pair, of, modified, kc, 135s, retired, in, 2000, and, 2004, respectively, and, replaced, in, 2005, with, a, c, 9, which, perform, parabolic, flights, astronauts, are, also, required, to, accumulate, a, number, of, flight, hours, in, high, performance, jet, aircraft, this, is, mostly, done, in, t, 38, jet, aircraft, out, of, ellington, field, due, to, its, proximity, to, the, johnson, space, center, ellington, field, is, also, where, the, shuttle, training, aircraft, is, maintained, and, developed, although, most, flights, of, the, aircraft, are, conducted, from, edwards, air, force, base, astronauts, in, training, must, learn, how, to, control, and, fly, the, space, shuttle, further, it, is, vital, that, they, are, familiar, with, the, international, space, station, so, they, know, what, they, must, do, when, they, get, there, the, master, s, degree, requirement, can, also, be, met, by, mission, specialist, educators, or, educator, astronauts, were, first, selected, in, 2004, as, of, 2007, there, are, three, nasa, educator, astronauts, joseph, m, acaba, richard, r, arnold, and, dorothy, metcalf, lindenburger, barbara, morgan, selected, as, back, up, teacher, to, christa, mcauliffe, in, 1985, is, considered, to, be, the, first, educator, astronaut, by, the, media, but, she, trained, as, a, mission, specialist, the, educator, astronaut, program, is, a, successor, to, the, teacher, in, space, program, from, the, 1980s, astronauts, are, susceptible, to, a, variety, of, health, risks, including, decompression, sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss, of, bone, and, muscle, loss, of, eyesight, orthostatic, intolerance, sleep, disturbances, and, radiation, injury, a, variety, of, large, scale, medical, studies, are, being, conducted, in, space, via, the, national, space, biomedical, research, institute, nsbri, to, address, these, issues, prominent, among, these, is, the, advanced, diagnostic, ultrasound, in, microgravity, study, in, which, astronauts, including, former, iss, commanders, leroy, chiao, and, gennady, padalka, perform, ultrasound, scans, under, the, guidance, of, remote, experts, to, diagnose, and, potentially, treat, hundreds, of, medical, conditions, in, space, this, study, s, techniques, are, now, being, applied, to, cover, professional, and, olympic, sports, injuries, as, well, as, ultrasound, performed, by, non, expert, operators, in, medical, and, high, school, students, it, is, anticipated, that, remote, guided, ultrasound, will, have, application, on, earth, in, emergency, and, rural, care, situations, where, access, to, a, trained, physician, is, often, rare, a, 2006, space, shuttle, experiment, found, that, salmonella, typhimurium, a, bacterium, that, can, cause, food, poisoning, became, more, virulent, when, cultivated, in, space, more, recently, in, 2017, bacteria, were, found, to, be, more, resistant, to, antibiotics, and, to, thrive, in, the, near, weightlessness, of, space, microorganisms, have, been, observed, to, survive, the, vacuum, of, outer, space, on, 31, december, 2012, a, nasa, supported, study, reported, that, human, spaceflight, may, harm, the, brain, and, accelerate, the, onset, of, alzheimer, s, disease, in, october, 2015, the, nasa, office, of, inspector, general, issued, a, health, hazards, report, related, to, space, exploration, including, a, human, mission, to, mars, over, the, last, decade, flight, surgeons, and, scientists, at, nasa, have, seen, a, pattern, of, vision, problems, in, astronauts, on, long, duration, space, missions, the, syndrome, known, as, visual, impairment, intracranial, pressure, viip, has, been, reported, in, nearly, two, thirds, of, space, explorers, after, long, periods, spent, aboard, the, international, space, station, iss, on, 2, november, 2017, scientists, reported, that, significant, changes, in, the, position, and, structure, of, the, brain, have, been, found, in, astronauts, who, have, taken, trips, in, space, based, on, mri, studies, astronauts, who, took, longer, space, trips, were, associated, with, greater, brain, changes, being, in, space, can, be, physiologically, deconditioning, on, the, body, it, can, affect, the, otolith, organs, and, adaptive, capabilities, of, the, central, nervous, system, zero, gravity, and, cosmic, rays, can, cause, many, implications, for, astronauts, in, october, 2018, nasa, funded, researchers, found, that, lengthy, journeys, into, outer, space, including, travel, to, the, planet, mars, may, substantially, damage, the, gastrointestinal, tissues, of, astronauts, the, studies, support, earlier, work, that, found, such, journeys, could, significantly, damage, the, brains, of, astronauts, and, age, them, prematurely, researchers, in, 2018, reported, after, detecting, the, presence, on, the, international, space, station, iss, of, five, enterobacter, bugandensis, bacterial, strains, none, pathogenic, to, humans, that, microorganisms, on, iss, should, be, carefully, monitored, to, continue, assuring, a, medically, healthy, environment, for, astronauts, a, study, by, russian, scientists, published, in, april, 2019, stated, that, astronauts, facing, space, radiation, could, face, temporary, hindrance, of, their, memory, centers, while, this, does, not, affect, their, intellectual, capabilities, it, temporarily, hinders, formation, of, new, cells, in, brain, s, memory, centers, the, study, conducted, by, moscow, institute, of, physics, and, technology, mipt, concluded, this, after, they, observed, that, mice, exposed, to, neutron, and, gamma, radiation, did, not, impact, the, rodents, intellectual, capabilities, a, 2020, study, conducted, on, the, brains, of, eight, male, russian, cosmonauts, after, they, returned, from, long, stays, aboard, the, international, space, station, showed, that, long, duration, spaceflight, causes, many, physiological, adaptions, including, macro, and, microstructural, changes, while, scientists, still, know, little, about, the, effects, of, spaceflight, on, brain, structure, this, study, showed, that, space, travel, can, lead, to, new, motor, skills, dexterity, but, also, slightly, weaker, vision, both, of, which, could, possibly, be, long, lasting, it, was, the, first, study, to, provide, clear, evidence, of, sensorimotor, neuroplasticity, which, is, the, brain, s, ability, to, change, through, growth, and, reorganization, an, astronaut, on, the, international, space, station, requires, about, 830, g, 29, oz, mass, of, food, per, meal, each, day, inclusive, of, about, 120, g, or, 4, 2, oz, packaging, mass, per, meal, space, shuttle, astronauts, worked, with, nutritionists, to, select, menus, that, appealed, to, their, individual, tastes, five, months, before, flight, menus, were, selected, and, analyzed, for, nutritional, content, by, the, shuttle, dietician, foods, are, tested, to, see, how, they, will, react, in, a, reduced, gravity, environment, caloric, requirements, are, determined, using, a, basal, energy, expenditure, bee, formula, on, earth, the, average, american, uses, about, 35, us, gallons, 130, l, of, water, every, day, on, board, the, iss, astronauts, limit, water, use, to, only, about, three, us, gallons, 11, l, per, day, in, russia, cosmonauts, are, awarded, pilot, cosmonaut, of, the, russian, federation, upon, completion, of, their, missions, often, accompanied, with, the, award, of, hero, of, the, russian, federation, this, follows, the, practice, established, in, the, ussr, where, cosmonauts, were, usually, awarded, the, title, hero, of, the, soviet, union, at, nasa, those, who, complete, astronaut, candidate, training, receive, a, silver, lapel, pin, once, they, have, flown, in, space, they, receive, a, gold, pin, u, s, astronauts, who, also, have, active, duty, military, status, receive, a, special, qualification, badge, known, as, the, astronaut, badge, after, participation, on, a, spaceflight, the, united, states, air, force, also, presents, an, astronaut, badge, to, its, pilots, who, exceed, 50, miles, 80, km, in, altitude, as, of, 2020, eighteen, astronauts, fourteen, men, and, four, women, have, died, during, four, space, flights, by, nationality, thirteen, were, american, four, were, russian, soviet, union, and, one, was, israeli, as, of, 2020, eleven, people, all, men, have, died, training, for, spaceflight, eight, americans, and, three, russians, six, of, these, were, in, crashes, of, training, jet, aircraft, one, drowned, during, water, recovery, training, and, four, were, due, to, fires, in, pure, oxygen, environments, astronaut, david, scott, left, a, memorial, consisting, of, a, statuette, titled, fallen, astronaut, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, during, his, 1971, apollo, 15, mission, along, with, a, list, of, the, names, of, eight, of, the, astronauts, and, six, cosmonauts, known, at, the, time, to, have, died, in, service, the, space, mirror, memorial, which, stands, on, the, grounds, of, the, kennedy, space, center, visitor, complex, is, maintained, by, the, astronauts, memorial, foundation, and, commemorates, the, lives, of, the, men, and, women, who, have, died, during, spaceflight, and, during, training, in, the, space, programs, of, the, united, states, in, addition, to, twenty, nasa, career, astronauts, the, memorial, includes, the, names, of, an, x, 15, test, pilot, a, u, s, air, force, officer, who, died, while, training, for, a, then, classified, military, space, program, and, a, civilian, spaceflight, participant
