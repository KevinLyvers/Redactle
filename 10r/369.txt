a, washer, is, a, thin, plate, typically, disk, shaped, but, sometimes, square, with, a, hole, typically, in, the, middle, that, is, normally, used, to, distribute, the, load, of, a, threaded, fastener, such, as, a, bolt, or, nut, other, uses, are, as, a, spacer, spring, belleville, washer, wave, washer, wear, pad, preload, indicating, device, locking, device, and, to, reduce, vibration, rubber, washer, washers, are, usually, metal, or, plastic, high, quality, bolted, joints, require, hardened, steel, washers, to, prevent, the, loss, of, pre, load, due, to, brinelling, after, the, torque, is, applied, washers, are, also, important, for, preventing, galvanic, corrosion, particularly, by, insulating, steel, screws, from, aluminium, surfaces, they, may, also, be, used, in, rotating, applications, as, a, bearing, a, thrust, washer, is, used, when, a, rolling, element, bearing, is, not, needed, either, from, a, cost, performance, perspective, or, due, to, space, restraints, coatings, can, be, used, to, reduce, wear, and, friction, either, by, hardening, the, surface, or, by, providing, a, solid, lubricant, i, e, a, self, lubricating, surface, the, origin, of, the, word, is, unknown, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, was, in, 1346, however, the, first, time, its, definition, was, recorded, was, in, 1611, rubber, or, fiber, gaskets, used, in, taps, or, faucets, valves, and, other, piping, connections, as, seal, against, water, leaks, are, sometimes, referred, to, colloquially, as, washers, but, while, they, may, look, similar, washers, and, gaskets, are, usually, designed, for, different, functions, and, made, differently, most, washers, can, be, categorized, into, three, broad, types, an, archaic, form, of, this, washer, was, sold, as, a, pot, mender, usually, in, small, quantities, through, a, retail, ironmonger, this, included, two, washers, a, nut, and, bolt, and, a, sealing, washer, of, rubber, cork, or, fibre, sheet, they, could, be, used, for, sealing, small, holes, rust, spots, or, removed, pipe, connections, in, water, tanks, or, large, cooking, vessels, spring, washers, are, a, left, hand, helix, and, allow, the, thread, to, be, tightened, in, a, right, hand, direction, only, i, e, a, clockwise, direction, when, a, left, hand, turning, motion, is, applied, the, raised, edge, bites, into, the, underside, of, the, bolt, or, nut, and, the, part, that, it, is, bolted, to, thus, resisting, turning, therefore, spring, washers, are, ineffective, on, left, hand, threads, and, hardened, surfaces, also, they, are, not, to, be, used, in, conjunction, with, a, flat, washer, under, the, spring, washer, as, this, isolates, the, spring, washer, from, biting, into, the, component, that, will, resist, turning, the, use, and, effectiveness, of, spring, lock, washers, has, been, debated, with, some, publications, advising, against, their, use, on, the, grounds, that, when, tight, the, washer, is, flat, against, the, substrate, and, gives, no, more, resistance, to, rotation, than, a, normal, washer, at, the, same, torque, a, 1990, nasa, manual, states, in, summary, a, lockwasher, of, this, type, is, useless, for, locking, however, a, spring, washer, will, continue, to, hold, the, bolt, against, the, substrate, and, maintain, friction, when, loosened, slightly, whereas, a, plain, washer, will, not, the, benefit, of, spring, lock, washers, lies, in, the, trapezoidal, shape, of, the, washer, when, compressed, to, loads, near, the, proof, strength, of, the, bolt, it, will, twist, and, flatten, this, reduces, the, spring, rate, of, the, bolted, joint, which, allows, it, to, maintain, more, force, under, the, same, vibration, levels, this, prevents, loosening, tooth, lockwashers, are, also, used, for, ground, bonding, where, a, metal, lug, or, object, must, be, electrically, bonded, to, a, surface, the, teeth, of, the, washer, cut, through, surface, oxides, paints, or, other, finishes, and, provide, a, gas, tight, conductive, path, in, these, applications, the, washer, is, not, placed, under, the, head, of, the, screw, or, under, the, nut, it, is, placed, between, the, surfaces, to, be, bonded, lock, washers, locknuts, jam, nuts, and, thread, locking, fluid, are, ways, to, prevent, vibration, from, loosening, a, bolted, joint, the, term, washer, is, often, applied, to, various, gasket, types, such, as, those, used, to, seal, the, control, valve, in, taps, the, din, 125, metric, washer, standard, refers, to, subtypes, a, and, b, iso, 7089, calls, these, form, a, and, iso, 7090, calls, them, form, b, they, are, all, the, same, overall, size, but, form, b, is, chamfered, on, one, side, washers, can, be, fabricated, from, a, variety, of, materials, including, but, not, limited, to, a, number, of, techniques, are, used, to, enhance, the, corrosion, resistant, properties, of, certain, washer, materials, the, american, national, standards, institute, ansi, provides, standards, for, general, use, flat, washers, type, a, is, a, series, of, steel, washers, at, broad, tolerances, where, precision, is, not, critical, type, b, is, a, series, of, flat, washers, with, tighter, tolerances, where, outside, diameters, are, categorized, as, narrow, regular, or, wide, for, specific, bolt, sizes, type, is, not, to, be, confused, with, form, but, often, is, the, british, standard, for, metric, series, metal, washers, bs4320, written, in, 1968, coined, the, term, form, the, forms, go, from, a, to, g, and, dictate, the, outside, diameter, and, thickness, of, the, flat, washers, washers, of, standard, metric, sizes, equivalent, to, bs4320, form, a, are, listed, in, the, table, below, measurements, in, the, table, refer, to, the, dimensions, of, the, washers, as, described, by, the, drawing, specifications, for, standard, metric, flat, washers, were, known, as, din, 125, withdrawn, and, replaced, with, iso, 7089, din, deutsches, institut, f, r, normung, german, institute, for, standardization, standards, are, issued, for, a, variety, of, components, including, industrial, fasteners, as, metric, din, 125, flat, washers, the, din, standards, remain, common, in, germany, europe, and, globally, even, though, the, transition, to, iso, standards, is, taking, place, din, standards, continue, to, be, used, for, parts, which, do, not, have, iso, equivalents, or, for, which, there, is, no, need, for, standardization
