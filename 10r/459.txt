speech, synthesis, is, the, artificial, production, of, human, speech, a, computer, system, used, for, this, purpose, is, called, a, speech, synthesizer, and, can, be, implemented, in, software, or, hardware, products, a, text, to, speech, tts, system, converts, normal, language, text, into, speech, other, systems, render, symbolic, linguistic, representations, like, phonetic, transcriptions, into, speech, the, reverse, process, is, speech, recognition, synthesized, speech, can, be, created, by, concatenating, pieces, of, recorded, speech, that, are, stored, in, a, database, systems, differ, in, the, size, of, the, stored, speech, units, a, system, that, stores, phones, or, diphones, provides, the, largest, output, range, but, may, lack, clarity, for, specific, usage, domains, the, storage, of, entire, words, or, sentences, allows, for, high, quality, output, alternatively, a, synthesizer, can, incorporate, a, model, of, the, vocal, tract, and, other, human, voice, characteristics, to, create, a, completely, synthetic, voice, output, the, quality, of, a, speech, synthesizer, is, judged, by, its, similarity, to, the, human, voice, and, by, its, ability, to, be, understood, clearly, an, intelligible, text, to, speech, program, allows, people, with, visual, impairments, or, reading, disabilities, to, listen, to, written, words, on, a, home, computer, many, computer, operating, systems, have, included, speech, synthesizers, since, the, early, 1990s, a, text, to, speech, system, or, engine, is, composed, of, two, parts, a, front, end, and, a, back, end, the, front, end, has, two, major, tasks, first, it, converts, raw, text, containing, symbols, like, numbers, and, abbreviations, into, the, equivalent, of, written, out, words, this, process, is, often, called, text, normalization, pre, processing, or, tokenization, the, front, end, then, assigns, phonetic, transcriptions, to, each, word, and, divides, and, marks, the, text, into, prosodic, units, like, phrases, clauses, and, sentences, the, process, of, assigning, phonetic, transcriptions, to, words, is, called, text, to, phoneme, or, grapheme, to, phoneme, conversion, phonetic, transcriptions, and, prosody, information, together, make, up, the, symbolic, linguistic, representation, that, is, output, by, the, front, end, the, back, end, often, referred, to, as, the, synthesizer, then, converts, the, symbolic, linguistic, representation, into, sound, in, certain, systems, this, part, includes, the, computation, of, the, target, prosody, pitch, contour, phoneme, durations, which, is, then, imposed, on, the, output, speech, long, before, the, invention, of, electronic, signal, processing, some, people, tried, to, build, machines, to, emulate, human, speech, some, early, legends, of, the, existence, of, brazen, heads, involved, pope, silvester, ii, d, 1003, ad, albertus, magnus, 1198, 1280, and, roger, bacon, 1214, 1294, in, 1779, the, german, danish, scientist, christian, gottlieb, kratzenstein, won, the, first, prize, in, a, competition, announced, by, the, russian, imperial, academy, of, sciences, and, arts, for, models, he, built, of, the, human, vocal, tract, that, could, produce, the, five, long, vowel, sounds, in, international, phonetic, alphabet, notation, and, there, followed, the, bellows, operated, acoustic, mechanical, speech, machine, of, wolfgang, von, kempelen, of, pressburg, hungary, described, in, a, 1791, paper, this, machine, added, models, of, the, tongue, and, lips, enabling, it, to, produce, consonants, as, well, as, vowels, in, 1837, charles, wheatstone, produced, a, speaking, machine, based, on, von, kempelen, s, design, and, in, 1846, joseph, faber, exhibited, the, euphonia, in, 1923, paget, resurrected, wheatstone, s, design, in, the, 1930s, bell, labs, developed, the, vocoder, which, automatically, analyzed, speech, into, its, fundamental, tones, and, resonances, from, his, work, on, the, vocoder, homer, dudley, developed, a, keyboard, operated, voice, synthesizer, called, the, voder, voice, demonstrator, which, he, exhibited, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, dr, franklin, s, cooper, and, his, colleagues, at, haskins, laboratories, built, the, pattern, playback, in, the, late, 1940s, and, completed, it, in, 1950, there, were, several, different, versions, of, this, hardware, device, only, one, currently, survives, the, machine, converts, pictures, of, the, acoustic, patterns, of, speech, in, the, form, of, a, spectrogram, back, into, sound, using, this, device, alvin, liberman, and, colleagues, discovered, acoustic, cues, for, the, perception, of, phonetic, segments, consonants, and, vowels, the, first, computer, based, speech, synthesis, systems, originated, in, the, late, 1950s, noriko, umeda, et, al, developed, the, first, general, english, text, to, speech, system, in, 1968, at, the, electrotechnical, laboratory, in, japan, in, 1961, physicist, john, larry, kelly, jr, and, his, colleague, louis, gerstman, used, an, ibm, 704, computer, to, synthesize, speech, an, event, among, the, most, prominent, in, the, history, of, bell, labs, kelly, s, voice, recorder, synthesizer, vocoder, recreated, the, song, daisy, bell, with, musical, accompaniment, from, max, mathews, coincidentally, arthur, c, clarke, was, visiting, his, friend, and, colleague, john, pierce, at, the, bell, labs, murray, hill, facility, clarke, was, so, impressed, by, the, demonstration, that, he, used, it, in, the, climactic, scene, of, his, screenplay, for, his, novel, 2001, a, space, odyssey, where, the, hal, 9000, computer, sings, the, same, song, as, astronaut, dave, bowman, puts, it, to, sleep, despite, the, success, of, purely, electronic, speech, synthesis, research, into, mechanical, speech, synthesizers, continues, linear, predictive, coding, lpc, a, form, of, speech, coding, began, development, with, the, work, of, fumitada, itakura, of, nagoya, university, and, shuzo, saito, of, nippon, telegraph, and, telephone, ntt, in, 1966, further, developments, in, lpc, technology, were, made, by, bishnu, s, atal, and, manfred, r, schroeder, at, bell, labs, during, the, 1970s, lpc, was, later, the, basis, for, early, speech, synthesizer, chips, such, as, the, texas, instruments, lpc, speech, chips, used, in, the, speak, spell, toys, from, 1978, in, 1975, fumitada, itakura, developed, the, line, spectral, pairs, lsp, method, for, high, compression, speech, coding, while, at, ntt, from, 1975, to, 1981, itakura, studied, problems, in, speech, analysis, and, synthesis, based, on, the, lsp, method, in, 1980, his, team, developed, an, lsp, based, speech, synthesizer, chip, lsp, is, an, important, technology, for, speech, synthesis, and, coding, and, in, the, 1990s, was, adopted, by, almost, all, international, speech, coding, standards, as, an, essential, component, contributing, to, the, enhancement, of, digital, speech, communication, over, mobile, channels, and, the, internet, in, 1975, musa, was, released, and, was, one, of, the, first, speech, synthesis, systems, it, consisted, of, a, stand, alone, computer, hardware, and, a, specialized, software, that, enabled, it, to, read, italian, a, second, version, released, in, 1978, was, also, able, to, sing, italian, in, an, a, cappella, style, dominant, systems, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, were, the, dectalk, system, based, largely, on, the, work, of, dennis, klatt, at, mit, and, the, bell, labs, system, the, latter, was, one, of, the, first, multilingual, language, independent, systems, making, extensive, use, of, natural, language, processing, methods, handheld, electronics, featuring, speech, synthesis, began, emerging, in, the, 1970s, one, of, the, first, was, the, telesensory, systems, inc, tsi, speech, portable, calculator, for, the, blind, in, 1976, other, devices, had, primarily, educational, purposes, such, as, the, speak, spell, toy, produced, by, texas, instruments, in, 1978, fidelity, released, a, speaking, version, of, its, electronic, chess, computer, in, 1979, the, first, video, game, to, feature, speech, synthesis, was, the, 1980, shoot, em, up, arcade, game, stratovox, known, in, japan, as, speak, rescue, from, sun, electronics, the, first, personal, computer, game, with, speech, synthesis, was, manbiki, shoujo, shoplifting, girl, released, in, 1980, for, the, pet, 2001, for, which, the, game, s, developer, hiroshi, suzuki, developed, a, zero, cross, programming, technique, to, produce, a, synthesized, speech, waveform, another, early, example, the, arcade, version, of, berzerk, also, dates, from, 1980, the, milton, bradley, company, produced, the, first, multi, player, electronic, game, using, voice, synthesis, milton, in, the, same, year, in, 1976, computalker, consultants, released, their, ct, 1, speech, synthesizer, designed, by, d, lloyd, rice, and, jim, cooper, it, was, an, analog, synthesizer, built, to, work, with, microcomputers, using, the, s, 100, bus, standard, early, electronic, speech, synthesizers, sounded, robotic, and, were, often, barely, intelligible, the, quality, of, synthesized, speech, has, steadily, improved, but, as, of, 2016, output, from, contemporary, speech, synthesis, systems, remains, clearly, distinguishable, from, actual, human, speech, synthesized, voices, typically, sounded, male, until, 1990, when, ann, syrdal, at, at, t, bell, laboratories, created, a, female, voice, kurzweil, predicted, in, 2005, that, as, the, cost, performance, ratio, caused, speech, synthesizers, to, become, cheaper, and, more, accessible, more, people, would, benefit, from, the, use, of, text, to, speech, programs, the, most, important, qualities, of, a, speech, synthesis, system, are, naturalness, and, intelligibility, naturalness, describes, how, closely, the, output, sounds, like, human, speech, while, intelligibility, is, the, ease, with, which, the, output, is, understood, the, ideal, speech, synthesizer, is, both, natural, and, intelligible, speech, synthesis, systems, usually, try, to, maximize, both, characteristics, the, two, primary, technologies, generating, synthetic, speech, waveforms, are, concatenative, synthesis, and, formant, synthesis, each, technology, has, strengths, and, weaknesses, and, the, intended, uses, of, a, synthesis, system, will, typically, determine, which, approach, is, used, concatenative, synthesis, is, based, on, the, concatenation, stringing, together, of, segments, of, recorded, speech, generally, concatenative, synthesis, produces, the, most, natural, sounding, synthesized, speech, however, differences, between, natural, variations, in, speech, and, the, nature, of, the, automated, techniques, for, segmenting, the, waveforms, sometimes, result, in, audible, glitches, in, the, output, there, are, three, main, sub, types, of, concatenative, synthesis, unit, selection, synthesis, uses, large, databases, of, recorded, speech, during, database, creation, each, recorded, utterance, is, segmented, into, some, or, all, of, the, following, individual, phones, diphones, half, phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and, sentences, typically, the, division, into, segments, is, done, using, a, specially, modified, speech, recognizer, set, to, a, forced, alignment, mode, with, some, manual, correction, afterward, using, visual, representations, such, as, the, waveform, and, spectrogram, an, index, of, the, units, in, the, speech, database, is, then, created, based, on, the, segmentation, and, acoustic, parameters, like, the, fundamental, frequency, pitch, duration, position, in, the, syllable, and, neighboring, phones, at, run, time, the, desired, target, utterance, is, created, by, determining, the, best, chain, of, candidate, units, from, the, database, unit, selection, this, process, is, typically, achieved, using, a, specially, weighted, decision, tree, unit, selection, provides, the, greatest, naturalness, because, it, applies, only, a, small, amount, of, digital, signal, processing, dsp, to, the, recorded, speech, dsp, often, makes, recorded, speech, sound, less, natural, although, some, systems, use, a, small, amount, of, signal, processing, at, the, point, of, concatenation, to, smooth, the, waveform, the, output, from, the, best, unit, selection, systems, is, often, indistinguishable, from, real, human, voices, especially, in, contexts, for, which, the, tts, system, has, been, tuned, however, maximum, naturalness, typically, require, unit, selection, speech, databases, to, be, very, large, in, some, systems, ranging, into, the, gigabytes, of, recorded, data, representing, dozens, of, hours, of, speech, also, unit, selection, algorithms, have, been, known, to, select, segments, from, a, place, that, results, in, less, than, ideal, synthesis, e, g, minor, words, become, unclear, even, when, a, better, choice, exists, in, the, database, recently, researchers, have, proposed, various, automated, methods, to, detect, unnatural, segments, in, unit, selection, speech, synthesis, systems, diphone, synthesis, uses, a, minimal, speech, database, containing, all, the, diphones, sound, to, sound, transitions, occurring, in, a, language, the, number, of, diphones, depends, on, the, phonotactics, of, the, language, for, example, spanish, has, about, 800, diphones, and, german, about, 2500, in, diphone, synthesis, only, one, example, of, each, diphone, is, contained, in, the, speech, database, at, runtime, the, target, prosody, of, a, sentence, is, superimposed, on, these, minimal, units, by, means, of, digital, signal, processing, techniques, such, as, linear, predictive, coding, psola, or, mbrola, or, more, recent, techniques, such, as, pitch, modification, in, the, source, domain, using, discrete, cosine, transform, diphone, synthesis, suffers, from, the, sonic, glitches, of, concatenative, synthesis, and, the, robotic, sounding, nature, of, formant, synthesis, and, has, few, of, the, advantages, of, either, approach, other, than, small, size, as, such, its, use, in, commercial, applications, is, declining, although, it, continues, to, be, used, in, research, because, there, are, a, number, of, freely, available, software, implementations, an, early, example, of, diphone, synthesis, is, a, teaching, robot, leachim, that, was, invented, by, michael, j, freeman, leachim, contained, information, regarding, class, curricular, and, certain, biographical, information, about, the, students, whom, it, was, programmed, to, teach, it, was, tested, in, a, fourth, grade, classroom, in, the, bronx, new, york, domain, specific, synthesis, concatenates, prerecorded, words, and, phrases, to, create, complete, utterances, it, is, used, in, applications, where, the, variety, of, texts, the, system, will, output, is, limited, to, a, particular, domain, like, transit, schedule, announcements, or, weather, reports, the, technology, is, very, simple, to, implement, and, has, been, in, commercial, use, for, a, long, time, in, devices, like, talking, clocks, and, calculators, the, level, of, naturalness, of, these, systems, can, be, very, high, because, the, variety, of, sentence, types, is, limited, and, they, closely, match, the, prosody, and, intonation, of, the, original, recordings, because, these, systems, are, limited, by, the, words, and, phrases, in, their, databases, they, are, not, general, purpose, and, can, only, synthesize, the, combinations, of, words, and, phrases, with, which, they, have, been, preprogrammed, the, blending, of, words, within, naturally, spoken, language, however, can, still, cause, problems, unless, the, many, variations, are, taken, into, account, for, example, in, non, rhotic, dialects, of, english, the, r, in, words, like, clear, kl, is, usually, only, pronounced, when, the, following, word, has, a, vowel, as, its, first, letter, e, g, clear, out, is, realized, as, kl, t, likewise, in, french, many, final, consonants, become, no, longer, silent, if, followed, by, a, word, that, begins, with, a, vowel, an, effect, called, liaison, this, alternation, cannot, be, reproduced, by, a, simple, word, concatenation, system, which, would, require, additional, complexity, to, be, context, sensitive, formant, synthesis, does, not, use, human, speech, samples, at, runtime, instead, the, synthesized, speech, output, is, created, using, additive, synthesis, and, an, acoustic, model, physical, modelling, synthesis, parameters, such, as, fundamental, frequency, voicing, and, noise, levels, are, varied, over, time, to, create, a, waveform, of, artificial, speech, this, method, is, sometimes, called, rules, based, synthesis, however, many, concatenative, systems, also, have, rules, based, components, many, systems, based, on, formant, synthesis, technology, generate, artificial, robotic, sounding, speech, that, would, never, be, mistaken, for, human, speech, however, maximum, naturalness, is, not, always, the, goal, of, a, speech, synthesis, system, and, formant, synthesis, systems, have, advantages, over, concatenative, systems, formant, synthesized, speech, can, be, reliably, intelligible, even, at, very, high, speeds, avoiding, the, acoustic, glitches, that, commonly, plague, concatenative, systems, high, speed, synthesized, speech, is, used, by, the, visually, impaired, to, quickly, navigate, computers, using, a, screen, reader, formant, synthesizers, are, usually, smaller, programs, than, concatenative, systems, because, they, do, not, have, a, database, of, speech, samples, they, can, therefore, be, used, in, embedded, systems, where, memory, and, microprocessor, power, are, especially, limited, because, formant, based, systems, have, complete, control, of, all, aspects, of, the, output, speech, a, wide, variety, of, prosodies, and, intonations, can, be, output, conveying, not, just, questions, and, statements, but, a, variety, of, emotions, and, tones, of, voice, examples, of, non, real, time, but, highly, accurate, intonation, control, in, formant, synthesis, include, the, work, done, in, the, late, 1970s, for, the, texas, instruments, toy, speak, spell, and, in, the, early, 1980s, sega, arcade, machines, and, in, many, atari, inc, arcade, games, using, the, tms5220, lpc, chips, creating, proper, intonation, for, these, projects, was, painstaking, and, the, results, have, yet, to, be, matched, by, real, time, text, to, speech, interfaces, articulatory, synthesis, consists, of, computational, techniques, for, synthesizing, speech, based, on, models, of, the, human, vocal, tract, and, the, articulation, processes, occurring, there, the, first, articulatory, synthesizer, regularly, used, for, laboratory, experiments, was, developed, at, haskins, laboratories, in, the, mid, 1970s, by, philip, rubin, tom, baer, and, paul, mermelstein, this, synthesizer, known, as, asy, was, based, on, vocal, tract, models, developed, at, bell, laboratories, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, by, paul, mermelstein, cecil, coker, and, colleagues, until, recently, articulatory, synthesis, models, have, not, been, incorporated, into, commercial, speech, synthesis, systems, a, notable, exception, is, the, next, based, system, originally, developed, and, marketed, by, trillium, sound, research, a, spin, off, company, of, the, university, of, calgary, where, much, of, the, original, research, was, conducted, following, the, demise, of, the, various, incarnations, of, next, started, by, steve, jobs, in, the, late, 1980s, and, merged, with, apple, computer, in, 1997, the, trillium, software, was, published, under, the, gnu, general, public, license, with, work, continuing, as, gnuspeech, the, system, first, marketed, in, 1994, provides, full, articulatory, based, text, to, speech, conversion, using, a, waveguide, or, transmission, line, analog, of, the, human, oral, and, nasal, tracts, controlled, by, carr, s, distinctive, region, model, more, recent, synthesizers, developed, by, jorge, c, lucero, and, colleagues, incorporate, models, of, vocal, fold, biomechanics, glottal, aerodynamics, and, acoustic, wave, propagation, in, the, bronchi, trachea, nasal, and, oral, cavities, and, thus, constitute, full, systems, of, physics, based, speech, simulation, hmm, based, synthesis, is, a, synthesis, method, based, on, hidden, markov, models, also, called, statistical, parametric, synthesis, in, this, system, the, frequency, spectrum, vocal, tract, fundamental, frequency, voice, source, and, duration, prosody, of, speech, are, modeled, simultaneously, by, hmms, speech, waveforms, are, generated, from, hmms, themselves, based, on, the, maximum, likelihood, criterion, sinewave, synthesis, is, a, technique, for, synthesizing, speech, by, replacing, the, formants, main, bands, of, energy, with, pure, tone, whistles, deep, learning, speech, synthesis, uses, deep, neural, networks, dnn, to, produce, artificial, speech, from, text, text, to, speech, or, spectrum, vocoder, the, deep, neural, networks, are, trained, using, a, large, amount, of, recorded, speech, and, in, the, case, of, a, text, to, speech, system, the, associated, labels, and, or, input, text, 15, ai, uses, a, multi, speaker, model, hundreds, of, voices, are, trained, concurrently, rather, than, sequentially, decreasing, the, required, training, time, and, enabling, the, model, to, learn, and, generalize, shared, emotional, context, even, for, voices, with, no, exposure, to, such, emotional, context, the, deep, learning, model, used, by, the, application, is, nondeterministic, each, time, that, speech, is, generated, from, the, same, string, of, text, the, intonation, of, the, speech, will, be, slightly, different, the, application, also, supports, manually, altering, the, emotion, of, a, generated, line, using, emotional, contextualizers, a, term, coined, by, this, project, a, sentence, or, phrase, that, conveys, the, emotion, of, the, take, that, serves, as, a, guide, for, the, model, during, inference, elevenlabs, is, primarily, known, for, its, browser, based, ai, assisted, text, to, speech, software, speech, synthesis, which, can, produce, lifelike, speech, by, synthesizing, vocal, emotion, and, intonation, the, company, states, its, software, is, built, to, adjust, the, intonation, and, pacing, of, delivery, based, on, the, context, of, language, input, used, it, uses, advanced, algorithms, to, analyze, the, contextual, aspects, of, text, aiming, to, detect, emotions, like, anger, sadness, happiness, or, alarm, which, enables, the, system, to, understand, the, user, s, sentiment, resulting, in, a, more, realistic, and, human, like, inflection, other, features, include, multilingual, speech, generation, and, long, form, content, creation, with, contextually, aware, voices, the, dnn, based, speech, synthesizers, are, approaching, the, naturalness, of, the, human, voice, examples, of, disadvantages, of, the, method, are, low, robustness, when, the, data, are, not, sufficient, lack, of, controllability, and, low, performance, in, auto, regressive, models, for, tonal, languages, such, as, chinese, or, taiwanese, language, there, are, different, levels, of, tone, sandhi, required, and, sometimes, the, output, of, speech, synthesizer, may, result, in, the, mistakes, of, tone, sandhi, in, 2023, vice, reporter, joseph, cox, published, findings, that, he, had, recorded, five, minutes, of, himself, talking, and, then, used, a, tool, developed, by, elevenlabs, to, create, voice, deepfakes, that, defeated, a, bank, s, voice, authentication, system, the, process, of, normalizing, text, is, rarely, straightforward, texts, are, full, of, heteronyms, numbers, and, abbreviations, that, all, require, expansion, into, a, phonetic, representation, there, are, many, spellings, in, english, which, are, pronounced, differently, based, on, context, for, example, my, latest, project, is, to, learn, how, to, better, project, my, voice, contains, two, pronunciations, of, project, most, text, to, speech, tts, systems, do, not, generate, semantic, representations, of, their, input, texts, as, processes, for, doing, so, are, unreliable, poorly, understood, and, computationally, ineffective, as, a, result, various, heuristic, techniques, are, used, to, guess, the, proper, way, to, disambiguate, homographs, like, examining, neighboring, words, and, using, statistics, about, frequency, of, occurrence, recently, tts, systems, have, begun, to, use, hmms, discussed, above, to, generate, parts, of, speech, to, aid, in, disambiguating, homographs, this, technique, is, quite, successful, for, many, cases, such, as, whether, read, should, be, pronounced, as, red, implying, past, tense, or, as, reed, implying, present, tense, typical, error, rates, when, using, hmms, in, this, fashion, are, usually, below, five, percent, these, techniques, also, work, well, for, most, european, languages, although, access, to, required, training, corpora, is, frequently, difficult, in, these, languages, deciding, how, to, convert, numbers, is, another, problem, that, tts, systems, have, to, address, it, is, a, simple, programming, challenge, to, convert, a, number, into, words, at, least, in, english, like, 1325, becoming, one, thousand, three, hundred, twenty, five, however, numbers, occur, in, many, different, contexts, 1325, may, also, be, read, as, one, three, two, five, thirteen, twenty, five, or, thirteen, hundred, and, twenty, five, a, tts, system, can, often, infer, how, to, expand, a, number, based, on, surrounding, words, numbers, and, punctuation, and, sometimes, the, system, provides, a, way, to, specify, the, context, if, it, is, ambiguous, roman, numerals, can, also, be, read, differently, depending, on, context, for, example, henry, viii, reads, as, henry, the, eighth, while, chapter, viii, reads, as, chapter, eight, similarly, abbreviations, can, be, ambiguous, for, example, the, abbreviation, in, for, inches, must, be, differentiated, from, the, word, in, and, the, address, 12, st, john, st, uses, the, same, abbreviation, for, both, saint, and, street, tts, systems, with, intelligent, front, ends, can, make, educated, guesses, about, ambiguous, abbreviations, while, others, provide, the, same, result, in, all, cases, resulting, in, nonsensical, and, sometimes, comical, outputs, such, as, ulysses, s, grant, being, rendered, as, ulysses, south, grant, speech, synthesis, systems, use, two, basic, approaches, to, determine, the, pronunciation, of, a, word, based, on, its, spelling, a, process, which, is, often, called, text, to, phoneme, or, grapheme, to, phoneme, conversion, phoneme, is, the, term, used, by, linguists, to, describe, distinctive, sounds, in, a, language, the, simplest, approach, to, text, to, phoneme, conversion, is, the, dictionary, based, approach, where, a, large, dictionary, containing, all, the, words, of, a, language, and, their, correct, pronunciations, is, stored, by, the, program, determining, the, correct, pronunciation, of, each, word, is, a, matter, of, looking, up, each, word, in, the, dictionary, and, replacing, the, spelling, with, the, pronunciation, specified, in, the, dictionary, the, other, approach, is, rule, based, in, which, pronunciation, rules, are, applied, to, words, to, determine, their, pronunciations, based, on, their, spellings, this, is, similar, to, the, sounding, out, or, synthetic, phonics, approach, to, learning, reading, each, approach, has, advantages, and, drawbacks, the, dictionary, based, approach, is, quick, and, accurate, but, completely, fails, if, it, is, given, a, word, which, is, not, in, its, dictionary, as, dictionary, size, grows, so, too, does, the, memory, space, requirements, of, the, synthesis, system, on, the, other, hand, the, rule, based, approach, works, on, any, input, but, the, complexity, of, the, rules, grows, substantially, as, the, system, takes, into, account, irregular, spellings, or, pronunciations, consider, that, the, word, of, is, very, common, in, english, yet, is, the, only, word, in, which, the, letter, f, is, pronounced, as, a, result, nearly, all, speech, synthesis, systems, use, a, combination, of, these, approaches, languages, with, a, phonemic, orthography, have, a, very, regular, writing, system, and, the, prediction, of, the, pronunciation, of, words, based, on, their, spellings, is, quite, successful, speech, synthesis, systems, for, such, languages, often, use, the, rule, based, method, extensively, resorting, to, dictionaries, only, for, those, few, words, like, foreign, names, and, loanwords, whose, pronunciations, are, not, obvious, from, their, spellings, on, the, other, hand, speech, synthesis, systems, for, languages, like, english, which, have, extremely, irregular, spelling, systems, are, more, likely, to, rely, on, dictionaries, and, to, use, rule, based, methods, only, for, unusual, words, or, words, that, are, not, in, their, dictionaries, the, consistent, evaluation, of, speech, synthesis, systems, may, be, difficult, because, of, a, lack, of, universally, agreed, objective, evaluation, criteria, different, organizations, often, use, different, speech, data, the, quality, of, speech, synthesis, systems, also, depends, on, the, quality, of, the, production, technique, which, may, involve, analogue, or, digital, recording, and, on, the, facilities, used, to, replay, the, speech, evaluating, speech, synthesis, systems, has, therefore, often, been, compromised, by, differences, between, production, techniques, and, replay, facilities, since, 2005, however, some, researchers, have, started, to, evaluate, speech, synthesis, systems, using, a, common, speech, dataset, a, study, in, the, journal, speech, communication, by, amy, drahota, and, colleagues, at, the, university, of, portsmouth, uk, reported, that, listeners, to, voice, recordings, could, determine, at, better, than, chance, levels, whether, or, not, the, speaker, was, smiling, it, was, suggested, that, identification, of, the, vocal, features, that, signal, emotional, content, may, be, used, to, help, make, synthesized, speech, sound, more, natural, one, of, the, related, issues, is, modification, of, the, pitch, contour, of, the, sentence, depending, upon, whether, it, is, an, affirmative, interrogative, or, exclamatory, sentence, one, of, the, techniques, for, pitch, modification, uses, discrete, cosine, transform, in, the, source, domain, linear, prediction, residual, such, pitch, synchronous, pitch, modification, techniques, need, a, priori, pitch, marking, of, the, synthesis, speech, database, using, techniques, such, as, epoch, extraction, using, dynamic, plosion, index, applied, on, the, integrated, linear, prediction, residual, of, the, voiced, regions, of, speech, in, general, prosody, remains, a, challenge, for, speech, synthesizers, and, is, an, active, research, topic, popular, systems, offering, speech, synthesis, as, a, built, in, capability, in, the, early, 1980s, ti, was, known, as, a, pioneer, in, speech, synthesis, and, a, highly, popular, plug, in, speech, synthesizer, module, was, available, for, the, ti, 99, 4, and, 4a, speech, synthesizers, were, offered, free, with, the, purchase, of, a, number, of, cartridges, and, were, used, by, many, ti, written, video, games, games, offered, with, speech, during, this, promotion, included, alpiner, and, parsec, the, synthesizer, uses, a, variant, of, linear, predictive, coding, and, has, a, small, in, built, vocabulary, the, original, intent, was, to, release, small, cartridges, that, plugged, directly, into, the, synthesizer, unit, which, would, increase, the, device, s, built, in, vocabulary, however, the, success, of, software, text, to, speech, in, the, terminal, emulator, ii, cartridge, canceled, that, plan, the, mattel, intellivision, game, console, offered, the, intellivoice, voice, synthesis, module, in, 1982, it, included, the, sp0256, narrator, speech, synthesizer, chip, on, a, removable, cartridge, the, narrator, had, 2kb, of, read, only, memory, rom, and, this, was, utilized, to, store, a, database, of, generic, words, that, could, be, combined, to, make, phrases, in, intellivision, games, since, the, orator, chip, could, also, accept, speech, data, from, external, memory, any, additional, words, or, phrases, needed, could, be, stored, inside, the, cartridge, itself, the, data, consisted, of, strings, of, analog, filter, coefficients, to, modify, the, behavior, of, the, chip, s, synthetic, vocal, tract, model, rather, than, simple, digitized, samples, also, released, in, 1982, software, automatic, mouth, was, the, first, commercial, all, software, voice, synthesis, program, it, was, later, used, as, the, basis, for, macintalk, the, program, was, available, for, non, macintosh, apple, computers, including, the, apple, ii, and, the, lisa, various, atari, models, and, the, commodore, 64, the, apple, version, preferred, additional, hardware, that, contained, dacs, although, it, could, instead, use, the, computer, s, one, bit, audio, output, with, the, addition, of, much, distortion, if, the, card, was, not, present, the, atari, made, use, of, the, embedded, pokey, audio, chip, speech, playback, on, the, atari, normally, disabled, interrupt, requests, and, shut, down, the, antic, chip, during, vocal, output, the, audible, output, is, extremely, distorted, speech, when, the, screen, is, on, the, commodore, 64, made, use, of, the, 64, s, embedded, sid, audio, chip, arguably, the, first, speech, system, integrated, into, an, operating, system, was, the, circa, 1983, unreleased, atari, 1400xl, 1450xl, computers, these, used, the, votrax, sc01, chip, and, a, finite, state, machine, to, enable, world, english, spelling, text, to, speech, synthesis, the, atari, st, computers, were, sold, with, stspeech, tos, on, floppy, disk, the, first, speech, system, integrated, into, an, operating, system, that, shipped, in, quantity, was, apple, computer, s, macintalk, the, software, was, licensed, from, third, party, developers, joseph, katz, and, mark, barton, later, softvoice, inc, and, was, featured, during, the, 1984, introduction, of, the, macintosh, computer, this, january, demo, required, 512, kilobytes, of, ram, memory, as, a, result, it, could, not, run, in, the, 128, kilobytes, of, ram, the, first, mac, actually, shipped, with, so, the, demo, was, accomplished, with, a, prototype, 512k, mac, although, those, in, attendance, were, not, told, of, this, and, the, synthesis, demo, created, considerable, excitement, for, the, macintosh, in, the, early, 1990s, apple, expanded, its, capabilities, offering, system, wide, text, to, speech, support, with, the, introduction, of, faster, powerpc, based, computers, they, included, higher, quality, voice, sampling, apple, also, introduced, speech, recognition, into, its, systems, which, provided, a, fluid, command, set, more, recently, apple, has, added, sample, based, voices, starting, as, a, curiosity, the, speech, system, of, apple, macintosh, has, evolved, into, a, fully, supported, program, plaintalk, for, people, with, vision, problems, voiceover, was, for, the, first, time, featured, in, 2005, in, mac, os, x, tiger, 10, 4, during, 10, 4, tiger, and, first, releases, of, 10, 5, leopard, there, was, only, one, standard, voice, shipping, with, mac, os, x, starting, with, 10, 6, snow, leopard, the, user, can, choose, out, of, a, wide, range, list, of, multiple, voices, voiceover, voices, feature, the, taking, of, realistic, sounding, breaths, between, sentences, as, well, as, improved, clarity, at, high, read, rates, over, plaintalk, mac, os, x, also, includes, say, a, command, line, based, application, that, converts, text, to, audible, speech, the, applescript, standard, additions, includes, a, say, verb, that, allows, a, script, to, use, any, of, the, installed, voices, and, to, control, the, pitch, speaking, rate, and, modulation, of, the, spoken, text, used, in, alexa, and, as, software, as, a, service, in, aws, from, 2017, the, second, operating, system, to, feature, advanced, speech, synthesis, capabilities, was, amigaos, introduced, in, 1985, the, voice, synthesis, was, licensed, by, commodore, international, from, softvoice, inc, who, also, developed, the, original, macintalk, text, to, speech, system, it, featured, a, complete, system, of, voice, emulation, for, american, english, with, both, male, and, female, voices, and, stress, indicator, markers, made, possible, through, the, amiga, s, audio, chipset, the, synthesis, system, was, divided, into, a, translator, library, which, converted, unrestricted, english, text, into, a, standard, set, of, phonetic, codes, and, a, narrator, device, which, implemented, a, formant, model, of, speech, generation, amigaos, also, featured, a, high, level, speak, handler, which, allowed, command, line, users, to, redirect, text, output, to, speech, speech, synthesis, was, occasionally, used, in, third, party, programs, particularly, word, processors, and, educational, software, the, synthesis, software, remained, largely, unchanged, from, the, first, amigaos, release, and, commodore, eventually, removed, speech, synthesis, support, from, amigaos, 2, 1, onward, despite, the, american, english, phoneme, limitation, an, unofficial, version, with, multilingual, speech, synthesis, was, developed, this, made, use, of, an, enhanced, version, of, the, translator, library, which, could, translate, a, number, of, languages, given, a, set, of, rules, for, each, language, modern, windows, desktop, systems, can, use, sapi, 4, and, sapi, 5, components, to, support, speech, synthesis, and, speech, recognition, sapi, 4, 0, was, available, as, an, optional, add, on, for, windows, 95, and, windows, 98, windows, 2000, added, narrator, a, text, to, speech, utility, for, people, who, have, visual, impairment, third, party, programs, such, as, jaws, for, windows, window, eyes, non, visual, desktop, access, supernova, and, system, access, can, perform, various, text, to, speech, tasks, such, as, reading, text, aloud, from, a, specified, website, email, account, text, document, the, windows, clipboard, the, user, s, keyboard, typing, etc, not, all, programs, can, use, speech, synthesis, directly, some, programs, can, use, plug, ins, extensions, or, add, ons, to, read, text, aloud, third, party, programs, are, available, that, can, read, text, from, the, system, clipboard, microsoft, speech, server, is, a, server, based, package, for, voice, synthesis, and, recognition, it, is, designed, for, network, use, with, web, applications, and, call, centers, from, 1971, to, 1996, votrax, produced, a, number, of, commercial, speech, synthesizer, components, a, votrax, synthesizer, was, included, in, the, first, generation, kurzweil, reading, machine, for, the, blind, text, to, speech, tts, refers, to, the, ability, of, computers, to, read, text, aloud, a, tts, engine, converts, written, text, to, a, phonemic, representation, then, converts, the, phonemic, representation, to, waveforms, that, can, be, output, as, sound, tts, engines, with, different, languages, dialects, and, specialized, vocabularies, are, available, through, third, party, publishers, version, 1, 6, of, android, added, support, for, speech, synthesis, tts, currently, there, are, a, number, of, applications, plugins, and, gadgets, that, can, read, messages, directly, from, an, e, mail, client, and, web, pages, from, a, web, browser, or, google, toolbar, some, specialized, software, can, narrate, rss, feeds, on, one, hand, online, rss, narrators, simplify, information, delivery, by, allowing, users, to, listen, to, their, favourite, news, sources, and, to, convert, them, to, podcasts, on, the, other, hand, on, line, rss, readers, are, available, on, almost, any, personal, computer, connected, to, the, internet, users, can, download, generated, audio, files, to, portable, devices, e, g, with, a, help, of, podcast, receiver, and, listen, to, them, while, walking, jogging, or, commuting, to, work, a, growing, field, in, internet, based, tts, is, web, based, assistive, technology, e, g, browsealoud, from, a, uk, company, and, readspeaker, it, can, deliver, tts, functionality, to, anyone, for, reasons, of, accessibility, convenience, entertainment, or, information, with, access, to, a, web, browser, the, non, profit, project, pediaphon, was, created, in, 2006, to, provide, a, similar, web, based, tts, interface, to, the, wikipedia, other, work, is, being, done, in, the, context, of, the, w3c, through, the, w3c, audio, incubator, group, with, the, involvement, of, the, bbc, and, google, inc, some, open, source, software, systems, are, available, such, as, at, the, 2018, conference, on, neural, information, processing, systems, neurips, researchers, from, google, presented, the, work, transfer, learning, from, speaker, verification, to, multispeaker, text, to, speech, synthesis, which, transfers, learning, from, speaker, verification, to, achieve, text, to, speech, synthesis, that, can, be, made, to, sound, almost, like, anybody, from, a, speech, sample, of, only, 5, seconds, also, researchers, from, baidu, research, presented, a, voice, cloning, system, with, similar, aims, at, the, 2018, neurips, conference, though, the, result, is, rather, unconvincing, by, 2019, the, digital, sound, alikes, found, their, way, to, the, hands, of, criminals, as, symantec, researchers, know, of, 3, cases, where, digital, sound, alikes, technology, has, been, used, for, crime, this, increases, the, stress, on, the, disinformation, situation, coupled, with, the, facts, that, in, march, 2020, a, freeware, web, application, called, 15, ai, that, generates, high, quality, voices, from, an, assortment, of, fictional, characters, from, a, variety, of, media, sources, was, released, initial, characters, included, glados, from, portal, twilight, sparkle, and, fluttershy, from, the, show, my, little, pony, friendship, is, magic, and, the, tenth, doctor, from, doctor, who, a, number, of, markup, languages, have, been, established, for, the, rendition, of, text, as, speech, in, an, xml, compliant, format, the, most, recent, is, speech, synthesis, markup, language, ssml, which, became, a, w3c, recommendation, in, 2004, older, speech, synthesis, markup, languages, include, java, speech, markup, language, jsml, and, sable, although, each, of, these, was, proposed, as, a, standard, none, of, them, have, been, widely, adopted, speech, synthesis, markup, languages, are, distinguished, from, dialogue, markup, languages, voicexml, for, example, includes, tags, related, to, speech, recognition, dialogue, management, and, touchtone, dialing, in, addition, to, text, to, speech, markup, speech, synthesis, has, long, been, a, vital, assistive, technology, tool, and, its, application, in, this, area, is, significant, and, widespread, it, allows, environmental, barriers, to, be, removed, for, people, with, a, wide, range, of, disabilities, the, longest, application, has, been, in, the, use, of, screen, readers, for, people, with, visual, impairment, but, text, to, speech, systems, are, now, commonly, used, by, people, with, dyslexia, and, other, reading, disabilities, as, well, as, by, pre, literate, children, they, are, also, frequently, employed, to, aid, those, with, severe, speech, impairment, usually, through, a, dedicated, voice, output, communication, aid, work, to, personalize, a, synthetic, voice, to, better, match, a, person, s, personality, or, historical, voice, is, becoming, available, a, noted, application, of, speech, synthesis, was, the, kurzweil, reading, machine, for, the, blind, which, incorporated, text, to, phonetics, software, based, on, work, from, haskins, laboratories, and, a, black, box, synthesizer, built, by, votrax, speech, synthesis, techniques, are, also, used, in, entertainment, productions, such, as, games, and, animations, in, 2007, animo, limited, announced, the, development, of, a, software, application, package, based, on, its, speech, synthesis, software, finespeech, explicitly, geared, towards, customers, in, the, entertainment, industries, able, to, generate, narration, and, lines, of, dialogue, according, to, user, specifications, the, application, reached, maturity, in, 2008, when, nec, biglobe, announced, a, web, service, that, allows, users, to, create, phrases, from, the, voices, of, characters, from, the, japanese, anime, series, code, geass, lelouch, of, the, rebellion, r2, 15, ai, has, been, frequently, used, for, content, creation, in, various, fandoms, including, the, my, little, pony, friendship, is, magic, fandom, the, team, fortress, 2, fandom, the, portal, fandom, and, the, spongebob, squarepants, fandom, text, to, speech, for, disability, and, impaired, communication, aids, have, become, widely, available, text, to, speech, is, also, finding, new, applications, for, example, speech, synthesis, combined, with, speech, recognition, allows, for, interaction, with, mobile, devices, via, natural, language, processing, interfaces, some, users, have, also, created, ai, virtual, assistants, using, 15, ai, and, external, voice, control, software, text, to, speech, is, also, used, in, second, language, acquisition, voki, for, instance, is, an, educational, tool, created, by, oddcast, that, allows, users, to, create, their, own, talking, avatar, using, different, accents, they, can, be, emailed, embedded, on, websites, or, shared, on, social, media, content, creators, have, used, voice, cloning, tools, to, recreate, their, voices, for, podcasts, narration, and, comedy, shows, publishers, and, authors, have, also, used, such, software, to, narrate, audiobooks, and, newsletters, another, area, of, application, is, ai, video, creation, with, talking, heads, webapps, and, video, editors, like, elai, io, or, synthesia, allow, users, to, create, video, content, involving, ai, avatars, who, are, made, to, speak, using, text, to, speech, technology, speech, synthesis, is, a, valuable, computational, aid, for, the, analysis, and, assessment, of, speech, disorders, a, voice, quality, synthesizer, developed, by, jorge, c, lucero, et, al, at, the, university, of, bras, lia, simulates, the, physics, of, phonation, and, includes, models, of, vocal, frequency, jitter, and, tremor, airflow, noise, and, laryngeal, asymmetries, the, synthesizer, has, been, used, to, mimic, the, timbre, of, dysphonic, speakers, with, controlled, levels, of, roughness, breathiness, and, strain
