a, sewing, machine, is, a, machine, used, to, sew, fabric, and, materials, together, with, thread, sewing, machines, were, invented, during, the, first, industrial, revolution, to, decrease, the, amount, of, manual, sewing, work, performed, in, clothing, companies, since, the, invention, of, the, first, sewing, machine, generally, considered, to, have, been, the, work, of, englishman, thomas, saint, in, 1790, the, sewing, machine, has, greatly, improved, the, efficiency, and, productivity, of, the, clothing, industry, home, sewing, machines, are, designed, for, one, person, to, sew, individual, items, while, using, a, single, stitch, type, at, a, time, in, a, modern, sewing, machine, the, process, of, stitching, has, been, automated, so, that, the, fabric, easily, glides, in, and, out, of, the, machine, early, sewing, machines, were, powered, by, either, constantly, turning, a, flywheel, handle, or, with, a, foot, operated, treadle, mechanism, electrically, powered, machines, were, later, introduced, industrial, sewing, machines, by, contrast, to, domestic, machines, are, larger, faster, and, more, varied, in, their, size, cost, appearance, and, tasks, charles, fredrick, wiesenthal, a, german, born, engineer, working, in, england, was, awarded, the, first, british, patent, for, a, mechanical, device, to, aid, the, art, of, sewing, in, 1755, his, invention, consisted, of, a, double, pointed, needle, with, an, eye, at, one, end, in, 1790, the, english, inventor, thomas, saint, invented, the, first, sewing, machine, design, his, machine, was, meant, to, be, used, on, leather, and, canvas, material, it, is, likely, that, saint, had, a, working, model, but, there, is, no, surviving, evidence, of, one, he, was, a, skilled, cabinet, maker, and, his, device, included, many, practical, and, functional, features, an, overhanging, arm, a, feed, mechanism, adequate, for, short, lengths, of, leather, a, vertical, needle, bar, and, a, looper, saint, created, the, machine, to, reduce, the, amount, of, hand, stitching, on, garments, making, sewing, more, reliable, and, functional, his, sewing, machine, used, the, chain, stitch, method, in, which, the, machine, uses, a, single, thread, to, make, simple, stitches, in, the, fabric, a, stitching, awl, would, have, pierced, the, material, and, a, forked, point, rod, would, have, carried, the, thread, through, the, hole, where, it, would, have, been, hooked, underneath, and, moved, to, the, next, stitching, place, after, which, the, cycle, would, be, repeated, thereby, locking, the, stitch, in, place, saint, s, machine, was, designed, to, aid, in, the, manufacturing, of, various, leather, goods, including, saddles, and, bridles, but, it, was, also, capable, of, working, with, canvas, and, was, used, for, sewing, ship, sails, although, his, machine, was, very, advanced, for, the, era, the, concept, would, need, steady, improvement, over, the, coming, decades, before, it, was, practical, enough, to, enter, into, wide, use, in, 1874, a, sewing, machine, manufacturer, william, newton, wilson, found, saint, s, drawings, in, the, uk, patent, office, made, adjustments, to, the, looper, and, built, a, working, machine, currently, owned, by, the, science, museum, in, london, in, 1804, a, sewing, machine, was, built, by, two, englishmen, thomas, stone, and, james, henderson, and, a, machine, for, embroidering, was, constructed, by, john, duncan, in, scotland, an, austrian, tailor, josef, madersperger, began, developing, his, first, sewing, machine, in, 1807, and, presented, his, first, working, machine, publicly, in, 1814, having, received, financial, support, from, his, government, the, austrian, tailor, worked, on, the, development, of, his, machine, until, 1839, when, he, built, a, machine, imitating, the, weaving, process, using, the, chain, stitch, the, first, practical, and, widely, used, sewing, machine, was, invented, by, barth, lemy, thimonnier, a, french, tailor, in, 1829, his, machine, sewed, straight, seams, using, a, chain, stitch, like, saint, s, model, had, and, in, 1830, he, signed, a, contract, with, auguste, ferrand, a, mining, engineer, who, made, the, requisite, drawings, and, submitted, a, patent, application, the, patent, for, his, machine, was, issued, on, 17, july, 1830, and, in, the, same, year, he, and, his, partners, opened, the, first, machine, based, clothing, manufacturing, company, in, the, world, to, create, army, uniforms, for, the, french, army, however, the, factory, was, burned, down, reportedly, by, workers, fearful, of, losing, their, livelihood, following, the, issuing, of, the, patent, a, model, of, the, machine, is, exhibited, in, london, at, the, science, museum, the, machine, is, made, of, wood, and, uses, a, barbed, needle, which, passes, downward, through, the, cloth, to, grab, the, thread, and, pull, it, up, to, form, a, loop, to, be, locked, by, the, next, loop, the, first, american, lockstitch, sewing, machine, was, invented, by, walter, hunt, in, 1832, his, machine, used, a, needle, with, the, eye, and, the, point, on, the, same, end, carrying, the, upper, thread, and, a, falling, shuttle, carrying, the, lower, thread, the, curved, needle, moved, through, the, fabric, horizontally, leaving, the, loop, as, it, withdrew, the, shuttle, passed, through, the, loop, interlocking, the, thread, the, feed, was, unreliable, requiring, the, machine, to, be, stopped, frequently, and, reset, up, hunt, eventually, lost, interest, in, his, machine, and, sold, individual, machines, without, bothering, to, patent, his, invention, and, only, patenting, it, at, a, late, date, of, 1854, in, 1842, john, greenough, patented, the, first, sewing, machine, in, the, united, states, the, british, partners, newton, and, archibold, introduced, the, eye, pointed, needle, and, the, use, of, two, pressing, surfaces, to, keep, the, pieces, of, fabric, in, position, in, 1841, the, first, machine, to, combine, all, the, disparate, elements, of, the, previous, half, century, of, innovation, into, the, modern, sewing, machine, was, the, device, built, by, english, inventor, john, fisher, in, 1844, a, little, earlier, than, the, very, similar, machines, built, by, isaac, merritt, singer, in, 1851, and, the, lesser, known, elias, howe, in, 1845, however, due, to, the, botched, filing, of, fisher, s, patent, at, the, patent, office, he, did, not, receive, due, recognition, for, the, modern, sewing, machine, in, the, legal, disputations, of, priority, with, singer, and, singer, reaped, the, benefits, of, the, patent, elias, howe, born, in, spencer, massachusetts, created, his, sewing, machine, in, 1845, using, a, similar, method, to, fisher, s, except, that, the, fabric, was, held, vertically, an, important, improvement, on, his, machine, was, to, have, the, needle, running, away, from, the, point, starting, from, the, eye, after, a, lengthy, stay, in, england, trying, to, attract, interest, in, his, machine, he, returned, to, america, to, find, various, people, infringing, his, patent, among, them, isaac, merritt, singer, he, eventually, won, a, case, for, patent, infringement, in, 1854, and, was, awarded, the, right, to, claim, royalties, from, the, manufacturers, using, ideas, covered, by, his, patent, including, singer, singer, had, seen, a, rotary, sewing, machine, being, repaired, in, a, boston, shop, as, an, engineer, he, thought, it, was, clumsy, and, decided, to, design, a, better, one, the, machine, he, devised, used, a, falling, shuttle, instead, of, a, rotary, one, the, needle, was, mounted, vertically, and, included, a, presser, foot, to, hold, the, cloth, in, place, it, had, a, fixed, arm, to, hold, the, needle, and, included, a, basic, tension, system, this, machine, combined, elements, of, thimonnier, hunt, and, howe, s, machines, singer, was, granted, an, american, patent, in, 1851, the, foot, treadle, used, since, the, middle, ages, used, to, convert, reciprocating, to, rotary, motion, was, adapted, to, drive, the, sewing, machine, leaving, both, hands, free, when, howe, learned, of, singer, s, machine, he, took, him, to, court, where, howe, won, and, singer, was, forced, to, pay, a, lump, sum, for, all, machines, already, produced, singer, then, took, out, a, license, under, howe, s, patent, and, paid, him, us, 1, 15, per, machine, before, entering, into, a, joint, partnership, with, a, lawyer, named, edward, clark, they, created, the, first, hire, purchase, arrangement, to, allow, people, to, purchase, their, machines, through, payments, over, time, meanwhile, allen, b, wilson, developed, a, shuttle, that, reciprocated, in, a, short, arc, which, was, an, improvement, over, singer, and, howe, s, however, john, bradshaw, had, patented, a, similar, device, and, threatened, to, sue, so, wilson, decided, to, try, a, new, method, he, went, into, partnership, with, nathaniel, wheeler, to, produce, a, machine, with, a, rotary, hook, instead, of, a, shuttle, this, was, far, quieter, and, smoother, than, other, methods, with, the, result, that, the, wheeler, wilson, company, produced, more, machines, in, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, than, any, other, manufacturer, wilson, also, invented, the, four, motion, feed, mechanism, that, is, still, used, on, every, sewing, machine, today, this, had, a, forward, down, back, and, up, motion, which, drew, the, cloth, through, in, an, even, and, smooth, motion, charles, miller, patented, the, first, machine, to, stitch, buttonholes, throughout, the, 1850s, more, and, more, companies, were, being, formed, each, trying, to, sue, the, others, for, patent, infringement, this, triggered, a, patent, thicket, known, as, the, sewing, machine, war, in, 1856, the, sewing, machine, combination, was, formed, consisting, of, singer, howe, wheeler, wilson, and, grover, and, baker, these, four, companies, pooled, their, patents, with, the, result, that, all, other, manufacturers, had, to, obtain, a, license, for, 15, per, machine, this, lasted, until, 1877, when, the, last, patent, expired, james, edward, allen, gibbs, 1829, 1902, a, farmer, from, raphine, in, rockbridge, county, virginia, patented, the, first, chain, stitch, single, thread, sewing, machine, on, june, 2, 1857, in, partnership, with, james, willcox, gibbs, became, a, principal, partner, in, willcox, gibbs, sewing, machine, company, willcox, gibbs, commercial, sewing, machines, are, still, used, in, the, 21st, century, with, spares, parts, available, william, jones, started, making, sewing, machines, in, 1859, and, in, 1860, formed, a, partnership, with, thomas, chadwick, as, chadwick, jones, they, manufactured, sewing, machines, at, ashton, under, lyne, england, until, 1863, their, machines, used, designs, from, howe, and, wilson, produced, under, licence, thomas, chadwick, later, joined, bradbury, co, william, jones, opened, a, factory, in, guide, bridge, manchester, in, 1869, in, 1893, a, jones, advertising, sheet, claimed, that, this, factory, was, the, largest, factory, in, england, exclusively, making, first, class, sewing, machines, the, firm, was, renamed, as, the, jones, sewing, machine, co, ltd, and, was, later, acquired, by, brother, industries, of, japan, in, 1968, clothing, manufacturers, were, the, first, sewing, machine, customers, and, used, them, to, produce, the, first, ready, to, wear, clothing, and, shoes, in, the, 1860s, consumers, began, purchasing, them, and, the, machines, ranging, in, price, from, 6, to, 15, in, britain, depending, on, features, became, very, common, in, middle, class, homes, owners, were, much, more, likely, to, spend, free, time, with, their, machines, to, make, and, mend, clothing, for, their, families, than, to, visit, friends, and, women, s, magazines, and, household, guides, such, as, mrs, beeton, s, offered, dress, patterns, and, instructions, a, sewing, machine, could, produce, a, man, s, shirt, in, about, one, hour, compared, to, 14, 1, 2, hours, by, hand, in, 1877, the, world, s, first, crochet, machine, was, invented, and, patented, by, joseph, m, merrow, then, president, of, what, had, started, in, the, 1840s, as, a, machine, shop, to, develop, specialized, machinery, for, the, knitting, operations, this, crochet, machine, was, the, first, production, overlock, sewing, machine, the, merrow, machine, company, went, on, to, become, one, of, the, largest, american, manufacturers, of, overlock, sewing, machines, and, remains, in, the, 21st, century, as, the, last, american, over, lock, sewing, machine, manufacturer, in, 1885, singer, patented, the, singer, vibrating, shuttle, sewing, machine, which, used, allen, b, wilson, s, idea, for, a, vibrating, shuttle, and, was, a, better, lockstitcher, than, the, oscillating, shuttles, of, the, time, millions, of, the, machines, perhaps, the, world, s, first, really, practical, sewing, machine, for, domestic, use, were, produced, until, finally, superseded, by, rotary, shuttle, machines, in, the, 20th, century, sewing, machines, continued, being, made, to, roughly, the, same, design, with, more, lavish, decoration, until, well, into, the, 1900s, the, first, electric, machines, were, developed, by, singer, sewing, co, and, introduced, in, 1889, by, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, singer, was, offering, hand, treadle, and, electric, machines, for, sale, at, first, the, electric, machines, were, standard, machines, with, a, motor, strapped, on, the, side, but, as, more, homes, gained, power, they, became, more, popular, and, the, motor, was, gradually, introduced, into, the, casing, sewing, machines, were, strictly, mechanical, using, gears, shafts, levers, and, so, on, until, the, 1970s, when, electronic, machines, were, introduced, to, the, market, electronic, sewing, machines, incorporate, components, such, as, circuit, boards, computer, chips, and, additional, motors, for, independent, control, of, machine, functions, these, electronic, components, enabled, new, features, such, as, automating, thread, cutters, needle, positioning, and, back, tacking, as, well, as, digitized, stitch, patterns, and, stitch, combinations, because, of, the, lifespan, and, increased, complexity, of, the, electronic, parts, electronic, sewing, machines, do, not, last, as, long, as, mechanical, sewing, machines, which, can, last, over, 100, years, sewing, machines, can, make, a, great, variety, of, plain, or, patterned, stitches, ignoring, strictly, decorative, aspects, over, three, dozen, distinct, stitch, formations, are, formally, recognized, by, the, iso, 4915, 1991, standard, involving, one, to, seven, separate, threads, to, form, the, stitch, plain, stitches, fall, into, four, general, categories, chainstitch, lockstitch, overlock, and, coverstitch, chain, stitch, was, used, by, early, sewing, machines, and, has, two, major, drawbacks, a, better, stitch, was, found, in, the, lockstitch, the, chain, stitch, is, still, used, today, in, clothing, manufacture, though, due, to, its, major, drawbacks, it, is, generally, paired, with, an, overlock, stitch, along, the, same, seam, lockstitch, is, the, familiar, stitch, performed, by, most, household, sewing, machines, and, most, industrial, single, needle, sewing, machines, using, two, threads, one, passed, through, a, needle, and, one, coming, from, a, bobbin, or, shuttle, each, thread, stays, on, its, own, side, of, the, material, while, being, sewn, interlacing, with, the, other, thread, at, each, needle, hole, by, means, of, a, bobbin, driver, as, a, result, a, lockstitch, can, be, formed, anywhere, on, the, material, being, sewn, it, does, not, need, to, be, near, an, edge, overlock, also, known, as, serging, or, serger, stitch, can, be, formed, with, two, to, four, threads, one, or, two, needles, and, one, or, two, loopers, overlock, sewing, machines, are, usually, equipped, with, knives, that, trim, or, create, the, edge, immediately, in, front, of, the, stitch, formation, household, and, industrial, overlock, machines, are, commonly, used, for, garment, seams, in, knit, or, stretchy, fabrics, for, garment, seams, where, the, fabric, is, light, enough, that, the, seam, does, not, need, to, be, pressed, open, and, for, protecting, edges, against, raveling, machines, using, two, to, four, threads, are, most, common, and, frequently, one, machine, can, be, configured, for, several, varieties, of, overlock, stitch, overlock, machines, with, five, or, more, threads, usually, make, both, a, chainstitch, with, one, needle, and, one, looper, and, an, overlock, stitch, with, the, remaining, needles, and, loopers, this, combination, is, known, as, a, safety, stitch, a, similar, machine, used, for, stretch, fabrics, is, called, a, mock, safety, coverstitch, is, formed, by, two, or, more, needles, and, one, or, two, loopers, like, lockstitch, and, chainstitch, coverstitch, can, be, formed, anywhere, on, the, material, being, sewn, one, looper, manipulates, a, thread, below, the, material, being, sewn, forming, a, bottom, cover, stitch, against, the, needle, threads, an, additional, looper, above, the, material, can, form, a, top, cover, stitch, simultaneously, the, needle, threads, form, parallel, rows, while, the, looper, threads, cross, back, and, forth, all, the, needle, rows, coverstitch, is, so, called, because, the, grid, of, crossing, needle, and, looper, threads, covers, raw, seam, edges, much, as, the, overlock, stitch, does, it, is, widely, used, in, garment, construction, particularly, for, attaching, trims, and, flat, seaming, where, the, raw, edges, can, be, finished, in, the, same, operation, as, forming, the, seam, a, zigzag, stitch, is, a, variant, geometry, of, the, lockstitch, it, is, a, back, and, forth, stitch, used, where, a, straight, stitch, will, not, suffice, such, as, in, preventing, raveling, of, a, fabric, in, stitching, stretchable, fabrics, and, in, temporarily, joining, two, work, pieces, edge, to, edge, when, creating, a, zigzag, stitch, the, back, and, forth, motion, of, the, sewing, machine, s, needle, is, controlled, by, a, cam, as, the, cam, rotates, a, fingerlike, follower, that, is, connected, to, the, needle, bar, rides, along, the, cam, and, tracks, its, indentations, as, the, follower, moves, in, and, out, the, needle, bar, is, moved, from, side, to, side, very, old, sewing, machines, lack, this, hardware, and, so, cannot, natively, produce, a, zigzag, stitch, but, there, are, often, shank, driven, attachments, available, which, enable, them, to, do, so, besides, the, basic, motion, of, needles, loopers, and, bobbins, the, material, being, sewn, must, move, so, that, each, cycle, of, needle, motion, involves, a, different, part, of, the, material, this, motion, is, known, as, feed, and, sewing, machines, have, almost, as, many, ways, of, feeding, material, as, they, do, of, forming, stitches, for, general, categories, there, are, drop, feed, needle, feed, walking, foot, puller, and, manual, often, multiple, types, of, feed, are, used, on, the, same, machine, besides, these, general, categories, there, are, also, uncommon, feed, mechanisms, used, in, specific, applications, like, edge, joining, fur, making, seams, on, caps, and, blind, stitching, the, drop, feed, mechanism, is, used, by, almost, all, household, machines, and, involves, a, mechanism, below, the, sewing, surface, of, the, machine, when, the, needle, is, withdrawn, from, the, material, being, sewn, a, set, of, feed, dogs, is, pushed, up, through, slots, in, the, machine, surface, then, dragged, horizontally, past, the, needle, the, dogs, are, serrated, to, grip, the, material, and, a, presser, foot, is, used, to, keep, the, material, in, contact, with, the, dogs, at, the, end, of, their, horizontal, motion, the, dogs, are, lowered, again, and, returned, to, their, original, position, while, the, needle, makes, its, next, pass, through, the, material, while, the, needle, is, in, the, material, there, is, no, feed, action, almost, all, household, machines, and, the, majority, of, industrial, machines, use, drop, feed, differential, feed, is, a, variation, of, drop, feed, with, two, independent, sets, of, dogs, one, before, and, one, after, the, needle, by, changing, their, relative, motions, these, sets, of, dogs, can, be, used, to, stretch, or, compress, the, material, in, the, vicinity, of, the, needle, this, is, extremely, useful, when, sewing, stretchy, material, and, overlock, machines, heavily, used, for, such, materials, frequently, have, differential, feed, a, needle, feed, used, only, in, industrial, machines, moves, the, material, while, the, needle, is, in, the, material, in, fact, the, needle, may, be, the, primary, feeding, force, some, implementations, of, needle, feed, rock, the, axis, of, needle, motion, back, and, forth, while, other, implementations, keep, the, axis, vertical, while, moving, it, forward, and, back, in, both, cases, there, is, no, feed, action, while, the, needle, is, out, of, the, material, needle, feed, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, a, modified, drop, feed, and, is, very, common, on, industrial, two, needle, machines, most, household, machines, do, not, use, needle, feed, a, walking, foot, replaces, the, stationary, presser, foot, with, one, that, moves, along, with, whatever, other, feed, mechanisms, the, machine, already, has, as, the, walking, foot, moves, it, shifts, the, workpiece, along, with, it, it, is, most, useful, for, sewing, heavy, materials, where, needle, feed, is, mechanically, inadequate, for, spongy, or, cushioned, materials, where, lifting, the, foot, out, of, contact, with, the, material, helps, in, the, feeding, action, and, for, sewing, many, layers, together, where, a, drop, feed, will, cause, the, lower, layers, to, shift, out, of, position, with, the, upper, layers, some, factory, machines, and, a, few, household, machines, are, set, up, with, an, auxiliary, puller, feed, which, grips, the, material, being, sewn, usually, from, behind, the, needles, and, pulls, it, with, a, force, and, reliability, usually, not, possible, with, other, types, of, feed, puller, feeds, are, seldom, built, directly, into, the, basic, sewing, machine, their, action, must, be, synchronized, with, the, needle, and, feed, action, built, into, the, machine, to, avoid, damaging, the, machine, pullers, are, also, limited, to, straight, seams, or, very, nearly, so, despite, their, additional, cost, and, limitations, pulling, feeds, are, very, useful, when, making, large, heavy, items, like, tents, and, vehicle, covers, a, manual, feed, is, used, primarily, in, freehand, embroidery, quilting, and, shoe, repair, with, manual, feed, the, stitch, length, and, direction, is, controlled, entirely, by, the, motion, of, the, material, being, sewn, frequently, some, form, of, hoop, or, stabilizing, material, is, used, with, fabric, to, keep, the, material, under, proper, tension, and, aid, in, moving, it, around, most, household, machines, can, be, set, for, manual, feed, by, disengaging, the, drop, feed, dogs, most, industrial, machines, can, not, be, used, for, manual, feed, without, actually, removing, the, feed, dogs, sewing, machines, use, special, needles, tailored, to, their, needs, and, to, the, character, of, the, material, being, sewn, modern, sewing, machines, may, be, equipped, with, a, needle, guard, needle, guards, are, a, safety, measure, that, are, used, to, help, avoid, injuries, tension, in, a, sewing, machine, refers, to, the, pull, of, the, thread, between, the, needle, and, the, bobbin, sewing, machines, have, tension, discs, and, a, tension, regulator, if, the, stitch, is, too, saggy, or, too, tight, the, most, likely, cause, is, a, tension, problem, there, are, mainly, two, types, of, sewing, machines, available, industrial, and, domestic, industrial, sewing, machines, are, larger, faster, and, more, varied, in, their, size, cost, appearance, and, task, an, industrial, sewing, machine, can, handle, heavy, duty, sewing, jobs, industrial, machines, unlike, domestic, machines, perform, a, single, dedicated, task, and, are, capable, of, continuous, use, for, long, periods, they, have, larger, moving, parts, and, larger, motors, rated, for, continuous, operation, parts, for, different, industrial, machines, such, as, motors, sewing, feet, and, bobbins, may, be, interchangeable, but, this, is, not, always, so, the, motors, on, industrial, machines, as, with, most, of, their, components, lights, etc, are, separate, usually, mounted, to, the, underside, of, the, table, domestic, machines, have, their, oem, motors, mounted, inside, the, machine, there, are, two, different, types, of, motor, available, for, industrial, machines, a, servo, motor, which, uses, less, electricity, and, is, silent, when, not, in, use, and, the, more, traditional, clutch, motor, which, is, always, spinning, even, when, not, in, use, a, clutch, motor, is, always, running, and, making, noises, when, it, is, connected, to, electricity, the, constant, operation, ensures, consistency, and, speed, the, servo, motor, uses, less, electricity, than, a, clutch, motor, it, does, not, make, any, sound, unless, the, operator, hits, the, pedal, on, the, machine, but, it, cannot, withstand, the, same, kind, of, use, as, a, clutch, motor, before, sewing, machines, were, invented, women, spent, much, of, their, time, maintaining, their, family, s, clothing, middle, class, housewives, even, with, the, aid, of, a, hired, seamstress, would, devote, several, days, of, each, month,
