a, warehouse, is, a, building, for, storing, goods, warehouses, are, used, by, manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport, businesses, customs, etc, they, are, usually, large, plain, buildings, in, industrial, parks, on, the, outskirts, of, cities, towns, or, villages, warehouses, usually, have, loading, docks, to, load, and, unload, goods, from, trucks, sometimes, warehouses, are, designed, for, the, loading, and, unloading, of, goods, directly, from, railways, airports, or, seaports, they, often, have, cranes, and, forklifts, for, moving, goods, which, are, usually, placed, on, iso, standard, pallets, and, then, loaded, into, pallet, racks, stored, goods, can, include, any, raw, materials, packing, materials, spare, parts, components, or, finished, goods, associated, with, agriculture, manufacturing, and, production, in, india, and, hong, kong, a, warehouse, may, be, referred, to, as, a, godown, there, are, also, godowns, in, the, shanghai, bund, a, warehouse, can, be, defined, functionally, as, a, building, in, which, to, store, bulk, produce, or, goods, wares, for, commercial, purposes, the, built, form, of, warehouse, structures, throughout, time, depends, on, many, contexts, materials, technologies, sites, and, cultures, in, this, sense, the, warehouse, postdates, the, need, for, communal, or, state, based, mass, storage, of, surplus, food, prehistoric, civilizations, relied, on, family, or, community, owned, storage, pits, or, palace, storerooms, such, as, at, knossos, to, protect, surplus, food, the, archaeologist, colin, renfrew, argued, that, gathering, and, storing, agricultural, surpluses, in, bronze, age, minoan, palaces, was, a, critical, ingredient, in, the, formation, of, proto, state, power, the, need, for, warehouses, developed, in, societies, in, which, trade, reached, a, critical, mass, requiring, storage, at, some, point, in, the, exchange, process, this, was, highly, evident, in, ancient, rome, where, the, horreum, pl, horrea, became, a, standard, building, form, the, most, studied, examples, are, in, ostia, the, port, city, that, served, rome, the, horrea, galbae, a, warehouse, complex, on, the, road, towards, ostia, demonstrates, that, these, buildings, could, be, substantial, even, by, modern, standards, galba, s, horrea, complex, contained, 140, rooms, on, the, ground, floor, alone, covering, an, area, of, some, 225, 000, square, feet, 21, 000, m, 2, as, a, point, of, reference, less, than, half, of, u, s, warehouses, today, are, larger, than, 100, 000, square, feet, 9290, m, 2, the, need, for, a, warehouse, implies, having, quantities, of, goods, too, big, to, be, stored, in, a, domestic, storeroom, but, as, attested, by, legislation, concerning, the, levy, of, duties, some, medieval, merchants, across, europe, commonly, kept, goods, in, their, large, household, storerooms, often, on, the, ground, floor, or, cellars, an, example, is, the, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, the, substantial, quarters, of, german, traders, in, venice, which, combined, a, dwelling, warehouse, market, and, quarters, for, travellers, from, the, middle, ages, on, dedicated, warehouses, were, constructed, around, ports, and, other, commercial, hubs, to, facilitate, large, scale, trade, the, warehouses, of, the, trading, port, bryggen, in, bergen, norway, now, a, world, heritage, site, demonstrate, characteristic, european, gabled, timber, forms, dating, from, the, late, middle, ages, though, what, remains, today, was, largely, rebuilt, in, the, same, traditional, style, following, great, fires, in, 1702, and, 1955, during, the, industrial, revolution, of, the, mid, 18th, century, the, function, of, warehouses, evolved, and, became, more, specialised, the, mass, production, of, goods, launched, by, the, industrial, revolution, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, fuelled, the, development, of, larger, and, more, specialised, warehouses, usually, located, close, to, transport, hubs, on, canals, at, railways, and, portside, specialisation, of, tasks, is, characteristic, of, the, factory, system, which, developed, in, british, textile, mills, and, potteries, in, the, mid, late, 1700s, factory, processes, sped, up, work, and, deskilled, labour, bringing, new, profits, to, capital, investment, warehouses, also, fulfill, a, range, of, commercial, functions, besides, simple, storage, exemplified, by, manchester, s, cotton, warehouses, and, australian, wool, stores, receiving, stockpiling, and, despatching, goods, displaying, goods, for, commercial, buyers, packing, checking, and, labelling, orders, and, dispatching, them, the, utilitarian, architecture, of, warehouses, responded, fast, to, emerging, technologies, before, and, into, the, nineteenth, century, the, basic, european, warehouse, was, built, of, load, bearing, masonry, walls, or, heavy, framed, timber, with, a, suitable, external, cladding, inside, heavy, timber, posts, supported, timber, beams, and, joists, for, the, upper, levels, rarely, more, than, four, to, five, stories, high, a, gabled, roof, was, conventional, with, a, gate, in, the, gable, facing, the, street, rail, lines, or, port, for, a, crane, to, hoist, goods, into, the, window, gates, on, each, floor, below, convenient, access, for, road, transport, was, built, in, via, very, large, doors, on, the, ground, floor, if, not, in, a, separate, building, office, and, display, spaces, were, located, on, the, ground, or, first, floor, technological, innovations, of, the, early, 19th, century, changed, the, shape, of, warehouses, and, the, work, performed, inside, them, cast, iron, columns, and, later, moulded, steel, posts, saw, tooth, roofs, and, steam, power, all, except, steel, were, adopted, quickly, and, were, in, common, use, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, strong, slender, cast, iron, columns, began, to, replace, masonry, piers, or, timber, posts, to, carry, levels, above, the, ground, floor, as, modern, steel, framing, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, its, strength, and, constructibility, enabled, the, first, skyscrapers, steel, girders, replaced, timber, beams, increasing, the, span, of, internal, bays, in, the, warehouse, the, saw, tooth, roof, brought, natural, light, to, the, top, story, of, the, warehouse, it, transformed, the, shape, of, the, warehouse, from, the, traditional, peaked, hip, or, gable, to, an, essentially, flat, roof, form, that, was, often, hidden, behind, a, parapet, warehouse, buildings, now, became, strongly, horizontal, inside, the, top, floor, the, vertical, glazed, pane, of, each, saw, tooth, enabled, natural, lighting, over, displayed, goods, improving, buyer, inspection, hoists, and, cranes, driven, by, steam, power, expanded, the, capacity, of, manual, labour, to, lift, and, move, heavy, goods, two, new, power, sources, hydraulics, and, electricity, re, shaped, warehouse, design, and, practice, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, into, the, 20th, century, public, hydraulic, power, networks, were, constructed, in, many, large, industrial, cities, around, the, world, in, the, 1870s, 80s, exemplified, by, manchester, they, were, highly, effective, to, power, cranes, and, lifts, whose, application, in, warehouses, served, taller, buildings, and, enabled, new, labour, efficiencies, public, electricity, networks, emerged, in, the, 1890s, they, were, used, at, first, mainly, for, lighting, and, soon, to, electrify, lifts, making, possible, taller, more, efficient, warehouses, it, took, several, decades, for, electrical, power, to, be, distributed, widely, throughout, cities, in, the, western, world, 20th, century, technologies, made, warehousing, ever, more, efficient, electricity, became, widely, available, and, transformed, lighting, security, lifting, and, transport, from, the, 1900s, the, internal, combustion, engine, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, installed, in, mass, produced, vehicles, from, the, 1910s, it, not, only, reshaped, transport, methods, but, enabled, many, applications, as, a, compact, portable, power, plant, wherever, small, engines, were, needed, the, forklift, truck, was, invented, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, came, into, wide, use, after, world, war, ii, forklifts, transformed, the, possibilities, of, multi, level, pallet, racking, of, goods, in, taller, single, level, steel, framed, buildings, for, higher, storage, density, the, forklift, and, its, load, fixed, to, a, uniform, pallet, enabled, the, rise, of, logistic, approaches, to, storage, in, the, later, 20th, century, always, a, building, of, function, in, the, late, 20th, century, warehouses, began, to, adapt, to, standardization, mechanization, technological, innovation, and, changes, in, supply, chain, methods, here, in, the, 21st, century, we, are, currently, witnessing, the, next, major, development, in, warehousing, automation, a, good, warehouse, layout, consist, of, 5, areas, warehouses, are, generally, considered, industrial, buildings, and, are, usually, located, in, industrial, districts, or, zones, such, as, the, outskirts, of, a, city, loopnet, categorizes, warehouses, using, the, industrial, property, type, craftsman, book, company, s, 2018, national, building, cost, manual, lists, warehouses, under, the, industrial, structures, section, in, the, uk, warehouses, are, classified, under, the, town, and, country, planning, act, 1990, as, the, industrial, category, b8, storage, and, distribution, types, of, warehouses, include, storage, warehouses, distribution, centers, including, fulfillment, centers, and, truck, terminals, retail, warehouses, cold, storage, warehouses, and, flex, space, according, to, zendeq, there, are, 13, types, of, warehouses, these, displayed, goods, for, the, home, trade, this, would, be, finished, goods, such, as, the, latest, cotton, blouses, or, fashion, items, their, street, frontage, was, impressive, so, they, took, the, styles, of, italianate, palazzi, warehouses, are, now, more, technologically, oriented, and, help, in, linking, stocks, with, the, retail, store, in, an, accurate, way, richard, cobden, s, construction, in, manchester, s, mosley, street, was, the, first, palazzo, warehouse, there, were, already, seven, warehouses, on, portland, street, when, s, j, watts, co, commenced, building, the, elaborate, watts, warehouse, of, 1855, but, four, more, were, opened, before, it, was, finished, the, main, benefits, of, retail, warehouse, challenges, of, retail, warehouse, cold, storage, preserves, agricultural, products, refrigerated, storage, helps, in, eliminating, sprouting, rotting, and, insect, damage, edible, products, are, generally, not, stored, for, more, than, one, year, several, perishable, products, require, a, storage, temperature, as, low, as, 25, c, cold, storage, helps, stabilize, market, prices, and, evenly, distribute, goods, both, on, demand, and, timely, basis, the, farmers, get, the, opportunity, of, producing, cash, crops, to, get, remunerative, prices, the, consumers, get, the, supply, of, perishable, commodities, with, lower, fluctuation, of, prices, ammonia, and, freon, compressors, are, commonly, used, in, cold, storage, warehouses, to, maintain, the, temperature, ammonia, refrigerant, is, cheaper, easily, available, and, has, a, high, latent, heat, of, evaporation, but, it, is, also, highly, toxic, and, can, form, an, explosive, mixture, when, mixed, with, fuel, oil, insulation, is, also, important, to, reduce, the, loss, of, cold, and, to, keep, different, sections, of, the, warehouse, at, different, temperatures, there, are, two, main, types, of, refrigeration, system, used, in, cold, storage, warehouses, vapor, absorption, systems, vas, and, vapor, compression, systems, vcs, vas, although, comparatively, costlier, to, install, is, more, economical, in, operation, the, temperature, necessary, for, preservation, depends, on, the, storage, time, required, and, the, type, of, product, in, general, there, are, three, groups, of, products, foods, that, are, alive, e, g, fruits, and, vegetables, foods, that, are, no, longer, alive, and, have, been, processed, in, some, form, e, g, meat, and, fish, products, and, commodities, that, benefit, from, storage, at, controlled, temperature, e, g, beer, tobacco, location, is, important, for, the, success, of, a, cold, storage, facility, it, should, be, in, close, proximity, to, a, growing, area, as, well, as, a, market, be, easily, accessible, for, heavy, vehicles, and, have, an, uninterrupted, power, supply, plant, attached, cold, storage, is, the, preferred, option, for, some, manufacturers, who, want, to, keep, their, cold, storage, in, house, products, can, be, transported, via, conveyor, straight, from, manufacturing, to, a, dedicated, cold, storage, facility, on, site, these, catered, for, the, overseas, trade, they, became, the, meeting, places, for, overseas, wholesale, buyers, where, printed, and, plain, could, be, discussed, and, ordered, trade, in, cloth, in, manchester, was, conducted, by, many, nationalities, behrens, warehouse, is, on, the, corner, of, oxford, street, and, portland, street, it, was, built, for, louis, behrens, son, by, p, nunn, in, 1860, it, is, a, four, storey, predominantly, red, brick, build, with, 23, bays, along, portland, street, and, 9, along, oxford, street, the, behrens, family, were, prominent, in, banking, and, in, the, social, life, of, the, german, community, in, manchester, an, overseas, warehouse, refers, to, storage, facilities, located, abroad, it, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, cross, border, e, commerce, trade, where, local, businesses, transport, goods, en, masse, to, desired, market, countries, then, establish, a, warehouse, to, store, and, distribute, the, goods, in, response, to, local, sales, demands, this, process, includes, managing, tasks, such, as, sorting, packaging, and, delivering, straight, from, the, local, warehouse, accordingly, overseas, warehouses, can, be, principally, divided, into, two, types, self, operated, and, third, party, public, service, warehouses, self, operated, overseas, warehouses, are, established, and, administered, by, the, cross, border, e, commerce, enterprise, they, only, provide, logistics, services, like, warehousing, and, distribution, for, their, own, goods, implying, that, the, entire, logistics, system, of, the, cross, border, e, commerce, enterprise, is, self, controlled, on, the, other, hand, a, third, party, public, service, overseas, warehouse, is, built, and, run, by, a, separate, logistics, enterprise, there, they, provide, services, including, order, sorting, multi, channel, delivery, and, subsequent, transportation, for, multiple, exporting, e, commerce, companies, this, kind, of, warehouse, broadly, indicates, that, the, entire, e, commerce, logistics, system, is, under, third, party, control, the, fundamental, business, operations, in, overseas, warehouses, include, the, following, 1, sellers, send, bulk, products, from, their, home, country, to, an, overseas, warehouse, where, the, staff, undertakes, inventory, and, shelving, when, a, buyer, places, an, order, the, seller, sends, delivery, instructions, to, the, warehouse, system, and, local, delivery, is, then, executed, based, on, those, instructions, 2, in, instances, of, issues, with, sellers, accounts, or, incorrect, labels, goods, need, to, be, returned, to, the, overseas, warehouse, for, correction, and, re, sale, 3, a, common, transfer, practice, combines, amazon, s, fba, service, with, third, party, overseas, warehouses, where, goods, are, initially, stored, and, then, intermittently, moved, to, fba, for, replenishment, while, concurrently, shipping, from, overseas, warehouses, 4, the, warehouses, also, handle, supplementary, services, such, as, product, returns, and, exchanges, by, using, an, overseas, warehouse, the, delivery, speed, has, certain, advantages, which, can, improve, the, product, price, and, increase, gross, profit, to, a, certain, extent, at, the, same, time, it, can, also, improve, the, consumer, experience, and, stimulate, the, second, consumption, so, as, to, improve, the, overall, sales, modern, term, fulfillment, house, the, main, purpose, of, packing, warehouses, was, the, picking, checking, labelling, and, packing, of, goods, for, export, the, packing, warehouses, asia, house, india, house, and, velvet, house, along, whitworth, street, in, manchester, were, some, of, the, tallest, buildings, of, their, time, see, list, of, packing, houses, the, more, efficient, the, pick, and, pack, process, is, the, faster, items, can, be, shipped, to, customers, pick, and, pack, warehousing, is, the, process, in, which, fulfillment, centers, choose, products, from, shipments, and, re, package, them, for, distribution, when, shipments, are, received, by, the, warehouse, items, are, stored, and, entered, into, an, inventory, management, system, for, tracking, and, accountability, picking, refers, to, selecting, the, right, quantities, of, products, from, warehouse, storage, packing, on, the, other, hand, happens, when, those, products, are, placed, in, shipping, boxes, with, appropriate, packaging, materials, labeled, documented, and, shipped, warehouses, were, built, close, to, the, major, stations, in, railway, hubs, the, first, railway, warehouse, to, be, built, was, opposite, the, passenger, platform, at, the, terminus, of, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, there, was, an, important, group, of, warehouses, around, london, road, station, now, piccadilly, station, in, the, 1890s, the, great, northern, railway, company, s, warehouse, was, completed, on, deansgate, this, was, the, last, major, railway, warehouse, to, be, built, the, london, warehouse, picadilly, was, one, of, four, warehouses, built, by, the, manchester, sheffield, and, lincolnshire, railway, in, about, 1865, to, service, the, new, london, road, station, it, had, its, own, branch, to, the, ashton, canal, this, warehouse, was, built, of, brick, with, stone, detailing, it, had, cast, iron, columns, with, wrought, iron, beams, as, part, of, its, diversification, activities, cwc, developed, a, warehousing, facility, of, railway, land, along, a, railway, siding, as, a, pilot, project, at, whitefield, goods, terminal, at, bangalore, after, entering, into, an, agreement, with, indian, railway, this, project, started, operation, since, february, 2002, and, resulted, in, attracting, additional, traffic, to, the, railways, improvement, in, customer, service, and, an, increase, in, the, volumes, of, cargo, handled, by, cwc, the, success, of, this, project, led, cwc, to, consider, developing, railside, warehousing, complexes, at, other, centers, also, throughout, near, identified, rail, terminals, all, these, warehouse, types, can, trace, their, origins, back, to, the, canal, warehouses, which, were, used, for, trans, shipment, and, storage, castle, field, warehouses, in, manchester, are, of, this, type, and, important, as, they, were, built, at, the, terminus, of, the, bridgewater, canal, in, 1761, the, duke, s, warehouse, in, the, castle, field, canal, basin, in, manchester, was, the, first, canal, warehouse, to, have, the, classic, design, features, of, internal, canal, arms, multi, storeys, split, level, loading, terracing, and, water, powered, hoists, and, was, built, between, 1769, and, 1771, the, castle, field, terminus, of, the, bridgewater, canal, has, attracted, a, considerable, amount, of, interest, from, historians, since, the, 1860s, and, from, archaeologists, since, the, 1960s, these, studies, have, developed, two, themes, the, complexity, and, success, or, failure, of, the, water, management, systems, built, by, james, brindley, and, the, physical, development, of, the, basin, as, a, ware, house, zones, a, customised, storage, building, a, warehouse, enables, a, business, to, stockpile, goods, e, g, to, build, up, a, full, load, prior, to, transport, or, hold, unloaded, goods, before, further, distribution, or, store, goods, like, wine, and, cheese, that, require, maturation, as, a, place, for, storage, the, warehouse, has, to, be, secure, convenient, and, as, spacious, as, possible, according, to, the, owner, s, resources, the, site, and, contemporary, building, technology, before, mechanised, technology, developed, warehouse, functions, relied, on, human, labor, using, mechanical, lifting, aids, like, pulley, systems, breaking, it, down, warehouse, operations, covers, a, number, of, important, areas, from, the, receiving, organization, fulfillment, and, distribution, processes, these, areas, include, some, of, the, most, common, warehouse, storage, systems, are, a, piece, pick, is, a, type, of, order, selection, process, where, a, product, is, picked, and, handled, in, individual, units, and, placed, in, an, outer, carton, tote, or, another, container, before, shipping, catalog, companies, and, internet, retailers, are, examples, of, predominantly, piece, pick, operations, their, customers, rarely, order, in, pallet, or, case, quantities, instead, they, typically, order, just, one, or, two, pieces, of, one, or, two, items, several, elements, make, up, the, piece, pick, system, they, include, the, order, the, picker, the, pick, module, the, pick, area, handling, equipment, the, container, the, pick, method, used, and, the, information, technology, used, every, movement, inside, a, warehouse, must, be, accompanied, by, a, work, order, warehouse, operation, can, fail, when, workers, move, goods, without, work, orders, or, when, a, storage, position, is, left, unregistered, in, the, system, one, of, the, most, important, factors, to, be, considered, while, designing, a, warehouse, storage, plan, is, the, product, volume, the, products, which, has, high, demand, and, the, ones, that, has, to, reach, the, customer, or, the, next, workstation, in, a, short, span, of, time, has, to, be, kept, in, places, like, low, storage, racks, or, even, near, primary, aisles, which, greatly, minimizes, the, distance, to, be, moved, and, thus, the, time, consumed, opposingly, the, less, frequent, moved, products, can, be, placed, somewhere, distant, from, the, primary, aisles, or, even, the, higher, storage, racks, material, direction, and, tracking, in, a, warehouse, can, be, coordinated, by, a, warehouse, management, system, wms, a, database, driven, computer, program, the, development, of, work, procedures, goes, hard, in, hand, with, training, warehouse, personnel, most, firms, implement, a, wms, to, standardize, work, procedure, and, encourage, best, practice, these, systems, facilitate, management, in, their, daily, planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and, controlling, the, utilization, of, available, resources, to, move, and, store, materials, into, within, and, out, of, a, warehouse, while, supporting, staff, in, the, performance, of, material, movement, and, storage, in, and, around, a, warehouse, logistics, personnel, use, the, wms, to, improve, warehouse, efficiency, by, directing, pathways, and, to, maintain, accurate, inventory, by, recording, warehouse, transactions, some, warehouses, are, completely, automated, and, require, only, operators, to, work, and, handle, all, the, task, pallets, and, product, move, on, a, system, of, automated, conveyors, cranes, and, automated, storage, and, retrieval, systems, coordinated, by, programmable, logic, controllers, and, computers, running, logistics, automation, software, these, systems, are, often, installed, in, refrigerated, warehouses, where, temperatures, are, kept, very, cold, to, keep, the, product, from, spoiling, this, is, especially, true, in, electronics, warehouses, that, require, specific, temperatures, to, avoid, damaging, parts, automation, is, also, common, where, land, is, expensive, as, automated, storage, systems, can, use, vertical, space, efficiently, these, high, bay, storage, areas, are, often, more, than, 10, meters, 33, feet, high, with, some, over, 20, meters, 65, feet, high, automated, storage, systems, can, be, built, up, to, 40m, high, for, a, warehouse, to, function, efficiently, the, facility, must, be, properly, slotted, slotting, addresses, which, storage, medium, a, product, is, picked, from, pallet, rack, or, carton, flow, where, each, item, is, placed, for, storage, and, how, items, are, picked, pick, to, light, pick, to, voice, or, pick, to, paper, with, a, proper, slotting, plan, a, warehouse, can, ensure, that, fast, moving, items, are, stored, in, the, most, accessible, areas, or, closest, to, dock, areas, improve, its, inventory, rotation, requirements, such, as, first, in, first, out, fifo, and, last, in, first, out, lifo, systems, control, labor, costs, and, increase, productivity, pallet, racks, are, commonly, used, to, organize, a, warehouse, it, is, important, to, know, the, dimensions, of, racking, and, the, number, of, bays, needed, as, well, as, the, dimensions, of, the, product, to, be, stored, clearance, should, be, accounted, for, if, using, a, forklift, or, pallet, mover, to, move, inventory, to, help, speed, up, the, receiving, of, goods, radio, frequency, identification, rfid, portals, have, been, installed, at, the, doors, of, the, warehouses, for, instant, verification, of, product, information, like, the, skus, and, their, quantities, rfid, technology, also, ensures, precise, inventory, management, and, easy, goods, and, equipment, tracking, an, article, by, thomas, w, speh, published, around, 1990, and, considered, significant, by, the, warehousing, forum, stated, that, a, costing, system, for, warehousing, should, take, account, of, the, space, allocated, for, storage, per, period, of, time, and, the, time, taken, for, handling, materials, as, they, are, admitted, to, or, discharged, from, the, warehouse, speh, advises, businesses, on, the, factors, to, be, taken, into, account, in, building, up, a, handling, price, and, a, storage, price, which, will, enable, an, operator, to, make, a, profit, and, take, account, of, risks, such, as, unused, space, at, the, same, time, as, managing, buyers, expectations, of, a, fair, price, modern, warehouses, commonly, use, a, system, of, wide, aisle, pallet, racking, to, store, goods, which, can, be, loaded, and, unloaded, using, forklift, trucks, traditional, warehousing, has, declined, since, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, gradual, introduction, of, just, in, time, jit, techniques, the, jit, system, promotes, product, delivery, directly, from, suppliers, to, consumer, without, the, use, of, warehouses, however, with, the, gradual, implementation, of, offshore, outsourcing, and, offshoring, in, about, the, same, time, period, the, distance, between, the, manufacturer, and, the, retailer, or, the, parts, manufacturer, and, the, industrial, plant, grew, considerably, in, many, domains, necessitating, at, least, one, warehouse, per, country, or, per, region, in, any, typical, supply, chain, for, a, given, range, of, products, recent, retailing, trends, have, led, to, the, development, of, warehouse, style, retail, stores, these, high, ceiling, buildings, display, retail, goods, on, tall, heavy, duty, industrial, racks, rather, than,
