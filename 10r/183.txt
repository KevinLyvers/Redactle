a, fossil, fuel, is, a, carbon, compound, or, hydrocarbon, containing, material, such, as, coal, oil, and, natural, gas, formed, naturally, in, the, earth, s, crust, from, the, remains, of, prehistoric, organisms, animals, plants, and, planktons, a, process, that, occurs, within, geological, formations, reservoirs, of, such, compound, mixtures, can, be, extracted, and, burned, as, a, fuel, for, human, consumption, to, provide, heat, for, direct, use, such, as, for, cooking, or, heating, to, power, heat, engines, such, as, steam, or, internal, combustion, engines, that, can, propel, vehicles, or, to, generate, electricity, via, steam, turbine, generators, some, fossil, fuels, are, further, refined, into, derivatives, such, as, kerosene, gasoline, and, diesel, the, origin, of, fossil, fuels, is, the, anaerobic, decomposition, of, buried, dead, organisms, containing, organic, molecules, created, by, photosynthetic, carbon, fixation, the, conversion, from, these, materials, to, high, carbon, fossil, fuels, typically, requires, a, geological, process, of, millions, of, years, due, to, the, length, of, time, it, takes, nature, to, form, them, fossil, fuels, are, considered, non, renewable, resources, in, 2022, over, 80, of, primary, energy, consumption, in, the, world, and, over, 60, of, its, electricity, was, from, fossil, fuels, the, large, scale, burning, of, fossil, fuels, causes, serious, environmental, damage, over, 70, of, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, due, to, human, activity, in, 2022, was, co2, from, burning, them, natural, processes, on, earth, mostly, absorption, by, the, ocean, can, remove, only, a, small, part, of, this, co2, therefore, there, is, a, net, increase, of, many, billion, tonnes, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, per, year, although, methane, leaks, are, significant, 52, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, is, the, main, source, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, causing, global, warming, and, ocean, acidification, additionally, most, air, pollution, deaths, are, due, to, fossil, fuel, particulates, and, noxious, gases, it, is, estimated, that, this, costs, over, 3, of, the, global, gross, domestic, product, and, that, fossil, fuel, phase, out, will, save, millions, of, lives, each, year, recognition, of, the, climate, crisis, pollution, and, other, negative, impacts, caused, by, fossil, fuels, has, led, to, a, widespread, policy, transition, and, activist, movement, focused, on, ending, their, use, in, favor, of, sustainable, energy, because, the, fossil, fuel, industry, is, so, heavily, integrated, in, the, global, economy, and, heavily, subsidized, this, transition, is, expected, to, have, significant, economic, impacts, many, stakeholders, argue, that, this, change, needs, to, be, a, just, transition, and, create, policy, that, addresses, the, societal, burdens, created, by, the, stranded, assets, of, the, fossil, fuel, industry, international, policy, in, the, form, of, united, nations, sustainable, development, goals, for, affordable, and, clean, energy, and, climate, action, as, well, as, the, paris, climate, agreement, is, designed, to, facilitate, this, transition, at, a, global, level, in, 2021, the, international, energy, agency, concluded, that, no, new, fossil, fuel, extraction, projects, could, be, opened, if, the, global, economy, and, society, wants, to, avoid, the, worst, impacts, of, climate, change, and, meet, international, goals, for, climate, change, mitigation, the, theory, that, fossil, fuels, formed, from, the, fossilized, remains, of, dead, plants, by, exposure, to, heat, and, pressure, in, earth, s, crust, over, millions, of, years, was, first, introduced, by, andreas, libavius, in, his, 1597, alchemia, and, later, by, mikhail, lomonosov, as, early, as, 1757, and, certainly, by, 1763, the, first, use, of, the, term, fossil, fuel, occurs, in, the, work, of, the, german, chemist, caspar, neumann, in, english, translation, in, 1759, the, oxford, english, dictionary, notes, that, in, the, phrase, fossil, fuel, the, adjective, fossil, means, btained, by, digging, found, buried, in, the, earth, which, dates, to, at, least, 1652, before, the, english, noun, fossil, came, to, refer, primarily, to, long, dead, organisms, in, the, early, 18th, century, aquatic, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, that, died, and, sedimented, in, large, quantities, under, anoxic, conditions, millions, of, years, ago, began, forming, petroleum, and, natural, gas, as, a, result, of, anaerobic, decomposition, over, geological, time, this, organic, matter, mixed, with, mud, became, buried, under, further, heavy, layers, of, inorganic, sediment, the, resulting, high, temperature, and, pressure, caused, the, organic, matter, to, chemically, alter, first, into, a, waxy, material, known, as, kerogen, which, is, found, in, oil, shales, and, then, with, more, heat, into, liquid, and, gaseous, hydrocarbons, in, a, process, known, as, catagenesis, despite, these, heat, driven, transformations, the, energy, released, in, combustion, is, still, photosynthetic, in, origin, terrestrial, plants, tended, to, form, coal, and, methane, many, of, the, coal, fields, date, to, the, carboniferous, period, of, earth, s, history, terrestrial, plants, also, form, type, iii, kerogen, a, source, of, natural, gas, although, fossil, fuels, are, continually, formed, by, natural, processes, they, are, classified, as, non, renewable, resources, because, they, take, millions, of, years, to, form, and, known, viable, reserves, are, being, depleted, much, faster, than, new, ones, are, generated, fossil, fuels, have, been, important, to, human, development, because, they, can, be, readily, burned, in, the, open, atmosphere, to, produce, heat, the, use, of, peat, as, a, domestic, fuel, predates, recorded, history, coal, was, burned, in, some, early, furnaces, for, the, smelting, of, metal, ore, while, semi, solid, hydrocarbons, from, oil, seeps, were, also, burned, in, ancient, times, they, were, mostly, used, for, waterproofing, and, embalming, commercial, exploitation, of, petroleum, began, in, the, 19th, century, natural, gas, once, flared, off, as, an, unneeded, byproduct, of, petroleum, production, is, now, considered, a, very, valuable, resource, natural, gas, deposits, are, also, the, main, source, of, helium, heavy, crude, oil, which, is, much, more, viscous, than, conventional, crude, oil, and, oil, sands, where, bitumen, is, found, mixed, with, sand, and, clay, began, to, become, more, important, as, sources, of, fossil, fuel, in, the, early, 2000s, oil, shale, and, similar, materials, are, sedimentary, rocks, containing, kerogen, a, complex, mixture, of, high, molecular, weight, organic, compounds, which, yield, synthetic, crude, oil, when, heated, pyrolyzed, with, additional, processing, they, can, be, employed, instead, of, other, established, fossil, fuels, during, the, 2010s, and, 2020s, there, was, disinvestment, from, exploitation, of, such, resources, due, to, their, high, carbon, cost, relative, to, more, easily, processed, reserves, prior, to, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, windmills, and, watermills, provided, the, energy, needed, for, work, such, as, milling, flour, sawing, wood, or, pumping, water, while, burning, wood, or, peat, provided, domestic, heat, the, wide, scale, use, of, fossil, fuels, coal, at, first, and, petroleum, later, in, steam, engines, enabled, the, industrial, revolution, at, the, same, time, gas, lights, using, natural, gas, or, coal, gas, were, coming, into, wide, use, the, invention, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, and, its, use, in, automobiles, and, trucks, greatly, increased, the, demand, for, gasoline, and, diesel, oil, both, made, from, fossil, fuels, other, forms, of, transportation, railways, and, aircraft, also, require, fossil, fuels, the, other, major, use, for, fossil, fuels, is, in, generating, electricity, and, as, feedstock, for, the, petrochemical, industry, tar, a, leftover, of, petroleum, extraction, is, used, in, the, construction, of, roads, the, energy, for, the, green, revolution, was, provided, by, fossil, fuels, in, the, form, of, fertilizers, natural, gas, pesticides, oil, and, hydrocarbon, fueled, irrigation, the, development, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, has, significantly, supported, global, population, growth, it, has, been, estimated, that, almost, half, of, the, earth, s, population, are, currently, fed, as, a, result, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, use, according, to, head, of, a, fertilizers, commodity, price, agency, 50, of, the, world, s, food, relies, on, fertilisers, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, has, a, number, of, negative, externalities, harmful, environmental, impacts, where, the, effects, extend, beyond, the, people, using, the, fuel, these, effects, vary, between, different, fuels, all, fossil, fuels, release, co, 2, when, they, burn, thus, accelerating, climate, change, burning, coal, and, to, a, lesser, extent, oil, and, its, derivatives, contributes, to, atmospheric, particulate, matter, smog, and, acid, rain, air, pollution, from, fossil, fuels, in, 2018, has, been, estimated, to, cost, us, 2, 9, trillion, or, 3, 3, of, the, global, gross, domestic, product, gdp, climate, change, is, largely, driven, by, the, release, of, greenhouse, gases, like, co, 2, and, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, is, the, main, source, of, these, emissions, in, most, parts, of, the, world, climate, change, is, negatively, impacting, ecosystems, this, includes, contributing, to, the, extinction, of, species, and, reducing, people, s, ability, to, produce, food, thus, adding, to, the, problem, of, world, hunger, continued, rises, in, global, temperatures, will, lead, to, further, adverse, effects, on, both, ecosystems, and, people, the, world, health, organization, has, said, that, climate, change, is, the, greatest, threat, to, human, health, in, the, 21st, century, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, generates, sulfuric, and, nitric, acids, which, fall, to, earth, as, acid, rain, impacting, both, natural, areas, and, the, built, environment, monuments, and, sculptures, made, from, marble, and, limestone, are, particularly, vulnerable, as, the, acids, dissolve, calcium, carbonate, fossil, fuels, also, contain, radioactive, materials, mainly, uranium, and, thorium, which, are, released, into, the, atmosphere, in, 2000, about, 12, 000, tonnes, of, thorium, and, 5, 000, tonnes, of, uranium, were, released, worldwide, from, burning, coal, it, is, estimated, that, during, 1982, us, coal, burning, released, 155, times, as, much, radioactivity, into, the, atmosphere, as, the, three, mile, island, accident, burning, coal, also, generates, large, amounts, of, bottom, ash, and, fly, ash, these, materials, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, see, fly, ash, reuse, utilizing, for, example, about, 40, of, the, united, states, production, in, addition, to, the, effects, that, result, from, burning, the, harvesting, processing, and, distribution, of, fossil, fuels, also, have, environmental, effects, coal, mining, methods, particularly, mountaintop, removal, and, strip, mining, have, negative, environmental, impacts, and, offshore, oil, drilling, poses, a, hazard, to, aquatic, organisms, fossil, fuel, wells, can, contribute, to, methane, release, via, fugitive, gas, emissions, oil, refineries, also, have, negative, environmental, impacts, including, air, and, water, pollution, coal, is, sometimes, transported, by, diesel, powered, locomotives, while, crude, oil, is, typically, transported, by, tanker, ships, requiring, the, combustion, of, additional, fossil, fuels, a, variety, of, mitigating, efforts, have, arisen, to, counter, the, negative, effects, of, fossil, fuels, this, includes, a, movement, to, use, alternative, energy, sources, such, as, renewable, energy, environmental, regulation, uses, a, variety, of, approaches, to, limit, these, emissions, for, example, rules, against, releasing, waste, products, like, fly, ash, into, the, atmosphere, in, december, 2020, the, united, nations, released, a, report, saying, that, despite, the, need, to, reduce, greenhouse, emissions, various, governments, are, doubling, down, on, fossil, fuels, in, some, cases, diverting, over, 50, of, their, covid, 19, recovery, stimulus, funding, to, fossil, fuel, production, rather, than, to, alternative, energy, the, un, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, declared, that, humanity, is, waging, war, on, nature, this, is, suicidal, nature, always, strikes, back, and, it, is, already, doing, so, with, growing, force, and, fury, he, also, claimed, there, is, still, cause, for, hope, anticipating, the, us, plan, to, join, other, large, emitters, like, china, and, the, eu, in, adopting, targets, to, reach, net, zero, emissions, by, 2050, fossilflation, is, a, term, that, describes, the, impact, of, fossil, fuels, on, inflation, according, to, vox, in, august, 2022, economists, have, pointed, to, energy, prices, as, the, main, reason, for, high, inflation, noting, that, energy, prices, indirectly, affect, virtually, every, part, of, the, economy, sectors, that, raise, prices, significantly, as, a, result, of, higher, fossil, fuel, prices, include, transportation, food, and, shipping, mark, zandi, of, moody, s, says, that, fossil, fuel, prices, have, driven, every, big, episode, of, inflation, since, wwii, the, economic, impact, of, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, in, 2022, was, a, major, recent, example, of, fossil, fuels, causing, inflation, some, economists, including, isabel, schnabel, believe, that, dependence, on, fossil, fuels, is, the, main, driver, of, the, 2021, 2022, inflation, spike, gernot, wagner, argues, that, commodities, are, undesirable, energy, sources, because, they, are, susceptible, to, volatile, price, swings, that, technologies, like, renewable, energy, are, not, he, also, argues, that, technologies, improve, and, get, relatively, cheaper, over, time, coming, out, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, some, argued, for, the, possibility, of, a, base, effect, phenomenon, due, to, cheaper, than, normal, prices, such, as, for, oil, at, the, onset, of, the, pandemic, followed, by, above, average, prices, which, exacerbated, the, perceived, inflation, while, not, expected, to, provide, much, short, term, relief, the, inflation, reduction, act, seeks, to, make, the, united, states, less, dependent, on, fossil, fuels, and, their, ability, to, cause, inflation, in, the, economy, moody, s, estimates, that, by, 2030, the, bill, could, reduce, the, typical, american, household, s, spending, on, energy, by, more, than, 300, each, year, in, 2022, dollars, environmental, pollution, from, fossil, fuels, impacts, humans, because, particulates, and, other, air, pollution, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, cause, illness, and, death, when, inhaled, these, health, effects, include, premature, death, acute, respiratory, illness, aggravated, asthma, chronic, bronchitis, and, decreased, lung, function, the, poor, undernourished, very, young, and, very, old, and, people, with, preexisting, respiratory, disease, and, other, ill, health, are, more, at, risk, global, air, pollution, deaths, due, to, fossil, fuels, have, been, estimated, at, over, 8, million, people, 2018, nearly, 1, in, 5, deaths, worldwide, at, 10, 2, million, 2019, and, 5, 13, million, excess, deaths, from, ambient, air, pollution, from, fossil, fuel, use, 2023, while, all, energy, sources, inherently, have, adverse, effects, the, data, show, that, fossil, fuels, cause, the, highest, levels, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, are, the, most, dangerous, for, human, health, in, contrast, modern, renewable, energy, sources, appear, to, be, safer, for, human, health, and, cleaner, the, death, rates, from, accidents, and, air, pollution, in, the, eu, are, as, follows, per, terawatt, hour, twh, as, the, data, shows, coal, oil, natural, gas, and, biomass, cause, higher, death, rates, and, higher, levels, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, hydropower, nuclear, energy, wind, and, solar, power, scientists, propose, that, 1, 8, million, lives, have, been, saved, by, replacing, fossil, fuel, sources, with, nuclear, power, fossil, fuel, divestment, or, fossil, fuel, divestment, and, investment, in, climate, solutions, is, an, attempt, to, reduce, climate, change, by, exerting, social, political, and, economic, pressure, for, the, institutional, divestment, of, assets, including, stocks, bonds, and, other, financial, instruments, connected, to, companies, involved, in, extracting, fossil, fuels, fossil, fuel, divestment, campaigns, emerged, on, college, and, university, campuses, in, the, united, states, in, 2011, with, students, urging, their, administrations, to, turn, endowment, investments, in, the, fossil, fuel, industry, into, investments, in, clean, energy, and, communities, most, impacted, by, climate, change, in, 2012, unity, college, in, maine, became, the, first, institution, of, higher, learning, to, divest, its, endowment, from, fossil, fuels, by, 2015, fossil, fuel, divestment, was, reportedly, the, fastest, growing, divestment, movement, in, history, as, of, july, 2023, more, than, 1593, institutions, with, assets, totalling, more, than, 40, 5, trillion, in, assets, worldwide, had, begun, or, committed, some, form, of, divestment, of, fossil, fuels, in, 2019, saudi, aramco, was, listed, and, it, reached, a, us, 2, trillion, valuation, on, its, second, day, of, trading, after, the, world, s, largest, initial, public, offering, fossil, fuel, subsidies, are, energy, subsidies, on, fossil, fuels, they, may, be, tax, breaks, on, consumption, such, as, a, lower, sales, tax, on, natural, gas, for, residential, heating, or, subsidies, on, production, such, as, tax, breaks, on, exploration, for, oil, or, they, may, be, free, or, cheap, negative, externalities, such, as, air, pollution, or, climate, change, due, to, burning, gasoline, diesel, and, jet, fuel, some, fossil, fuel, subsidies, are, via, electricity, generation, such, as, subsidies, for, coal, fired, power, stations, eliminating, fossil, fuel, subsidies, would, reduce, the, health, risks, of, air, pollution, and, would, greatly, reduce, global, carbon, emissions, thus, helping, to, limit, climate, change, as, of, 2021, policy, researchers, estimate, that, substantially, more, money, is, spent, on, fossil, fuel, subsidies, than, on, environmentally, harmful, agricultural, subsidies, or, environmentally, harmful, water, subsidies, the, international, energy, agency, says, high, fossil, fuel, prices, hit, the, poor, hardest, but, subsidies, are, rarely, well, targeted, to, protect, vulnerable, groups, and, tend, to, benefit, better, off, segments, of, the, population, the, fossil, fuels, lobby, includes, paid, representatives, of, corporations, involved, in, the, fossil, fuel, industry, oil, gas, coal, as, well, as, related, industries, like, chemicals, plastics, aviation, and, other, transportation, because, of, their, wealth, and, the, importance, of, energy, transport, and, chemical, industries, to, local, national, and, international, economies, these, lobbies, have, the, capacity, and, money, to, attempt, to, have, outsized, influence, on, governmental, policy, in, particular, the, lobbies, have, been, known, to, obstruct, policy, related, to, environmental, protection, environmental, health, and, climate, action, lobbies, are, active, in, most, fossil, fuel, intensive, economies, with, democratic, governance, with, reporting, on, the, lobbies, most, prominent, in, canada, australia, the, united, states, and, europe, however, the, lobbies, are, present, in, many, parts, of, the, world, big, oil, companies, such, as, exxonmobil, shell, bp, totalenergies, chevron, corporation, and, conocophillips, are, among, the, largest, corporations, associated, with, the, fossil, fuels, lobby, the, american, petroleum, institute, is, a, powerful, industry, lobbyist, for, big, oil, with, significant, influence, in, washington, d, c, in, australia, australian, energy, producers, formerly, known, as, the, australian, petroleum, production, and, exploration, association, appea, has, significant, influence, in, canberra, and, helps, to, maintain, favorable, policy, settings, for, oil, and, gas
