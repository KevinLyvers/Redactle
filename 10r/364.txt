a, fastener, us, english, or, fastening, uk, english, is, a, hardware, device, that, mechanically, joins, or, affixes, two, or, more, objects, together, in, general, fasteners, are, used, to, create, non, permanent, joints, that, is, joints, that, can, be, removed, or, dismantled, without, damaging, the, joining, components, steel, fasteners, are, usually, made, of, stainless, steel, carbon, steel, or, alloy, steel, other, methods, of, joining, materials, some, of, which, may, create, permanent, joints, include, crimping, welding, soldering, brazing, taping, gluing, cement, or, the, use, of, other, adhesives, force, may, also, be, used, such, as, with, magnets, vacuum, like, suction, cups, or, even, friction, like, sticky, pads, some, types, of, woodworking, joints, make, use, of, separate, internal, reinforcements, such, as, dowels, or, biscuits, which, in, a, sense, can, be, considered, fasteners, within, the, scope, of, the, joint, system, although, on, their, own, they, are, not, general, purpose, fasteners, furniture, supplied, in, flat, pack, form, often, uses, cam, dowels, locked, by, cam, locks, also, known, as, conformat, fasteners, fasteners, can, also, be, used, to, close, a, container, such, as, a, bag, a, box, or, an, envelope, or, they, may, involve, keeping, together, the, sides, of, an, opening, of, flexible, material, attaching, a, lid, to, a, container, etc, there, are, also, special, purpose, closing, devices, e, g, a, bread, clip, items, like, a, rope, string, wire, cable, chain, or, plastic, wrap, may, be, used, to, mechanically, join, objects, however, because, they, have, additional, common, uses, they, are, not, generally, categorized, as, fasteners, likewise, hinges, and, springs, may, join, objects, together, but, they, are, ordinarily, not, considered, fasteners, because, their, primary, purpose, is, to, allow, articulation, rather, than, rigid, affixment, in, 2005, it, was, estimated, that, the, united, states, fastener, industry, runs, 350, manufacturing, plants, and, employs, 40, 000, workers, the, industry, is, strongly, tied, to, the, production, of, automobiles, aircraft, appliances, agricultural, machinery, commercial, construction, and, infrastructure, more, than, 200, billion, fasteners, are, used, per, year, in, the, u, s, 26, billion, of, these, by, the, automotive, industry, the, largest, distributor, of, fasteners, in, north, america, is, the, fastenal, company, there, are, three, major, steel, fasteners, used, in, industries, stainless, steel, carbon, steel, and, alloy, steel, the, major, grade, used, in, stainless, steel, fasteners, 200, series, 300, series, and, 400, series, titanium, aluminium, and, various, alloys, are, also, common, materials, of, construction, for, metal, fasteners, in, many, cases, special, coatings, or, plating, may, be, applied, to, metal, fasteners, to, improve, their, performance, characteristics, by, for, example, enhancing, corrosion, resistance, common, coatings, platings, include, zinc, chrome, and, hot, dip, galvanizing, when, selecting, a, fastener, for, industrial, applications, it, is, important, to, consider, a, variety, of, factors, the, threading, the, applied, load, on, the, fastener, the, stiffness, of, the, fastener, and, the, number, of, fasteners, needed, should, all, be, taken, into, account, when, choosing, a, fastener, for, a, given, application, it, is, important, to, know, the, specifics, of, that, application, to, help, select, the, proper, material, for, the, intended, use, factors, that, should, be, considered, include, a, threaded, fastener, has, internal, or, external, screw, threads, the, most, common, types, are, the, screw, nut, and, bolt, possibly, involving, washers, other, more, specialized, types, of, threaded, fasteners, include, captive, threaded, fasteners, stud, threaded, inserts, and, threaded, rods, other, types, of, fastener, include, common, head, styles, include, there, are, multiple, standards, bodies, for, fasteners, including, the, us, industrial, fasteners, institute, and, the, european, industrial, fastener, institute, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, asme, publishes, several, standards, on, fasteners, some, are, american, screws, bolts, and, nuts, were, historically, not, fully, interchangeable, with, their, british, counterparts, and, therefore, would, not, fit, british, equipment, properly, this, in, part, helped, lead, to, the, development, of, numerous, united, states, military, standards, and, specifications, for, the, manufacturing, of, essentially, any, piece, of, equipment, that, is, used, for, military, or, defense, purposes, including, fasteners, world, war, ii, was, a, significant, factor, in, this, change, a, key, component, of, most, military, standards, is, traceability, put, simply, hardware, manufacturers, must, be, able, to, trace, their, materials, to, their, source, and, provide, traceability, for, their, parts, going, into, the, supply, chain, usually, via, bar, codes, or, similar, methods, this, traceability, is, intended, to, help, ensure, that, the, right, parts, are, used, and, that, quality, standards, are, met, in, each, step, of, the, manufacturing, process, additionally, substandard, parts, can, traced, back, to, their, source, in, 1988, the, united, states, house, energy, subcommittee, on, oversight, and, investigations, investigated, counterfeit, mismarked, substandard, fasteners, and, found, extensive, use, in, critical, civilian, and, military, infrastructure, as, a, result, they, proposed, fastener, quality, assurance, act, of, 1988, hr5051, that, would, require, laboratory, testing, of, fasteners, in, critical, use, applications, prior,
