hunminjeongeum, haerye, emphasize, that, sejong, invented, it, himself, before, the, creation, of, the, new, alphabet, the, people, of, joseon, primarily, used, classical, chinese, to, write, alongside, a, few, writing, systems, like, idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and, gakpil, which, used, chinese, characters, to, approximate, sounds, of, the, korean, language, that, had, been, in, use, since, hundreds, of, years, before, hangul, however, due, to, the, fundamental, differences, between, the, korean, and, chinese, languages, and, the, large, number, of, chinese, characters, required, lower, class, people, of, joseon, lacked, the, privilege, of, education, and, were, illiterate, to, promote, literacy, king, sejong, created, hangul, which, initially, had, 28, letters, four, of, which, are, no, longer, in, use, hangul, was, completed, in, 1443, and, published, in, 1446, along, with, a, 33, page, manual, titled, hunminjeongeum, explaining, what, the, letters, are, as, well, as, the, philosophical, theories, and, motives, behind, them, king, sejong, faced, backlash, from, the, noble, class, as, many, disapproved, of, the, idea, of, a, common, writing, system, with, some, openly, opposing, its, creation, many, within, the, nobility, believed, that, giving, the, peasants, the, ability, to, read, and, write, would, allow, them, to, find, and, abuse, loopholes, within, the, law, others, felt, that, hangul, would, threaten, their, families, positions, in, court, by, creating, a, larger, pool, of, civil, servants, the, joseon, elite, continued, to, use, the, chinese, hanja, long, after, sejong, s, death, hangul, was, often, treated, with, contempt, by, those, in, power, and, received, criticism, in, the, form, of, nicknames, including, eonmun, vulgar, script, amkeul, women, s, script, and, ahaekkeul, children, s, script, it, was, commonly, used, for, areas, like, casual, writing, prose, and, bookkeeping, especially, by, the, urban, middle, class, like, administrators, and, bureaucrats, it, notably, gained, popularity, among, women, and, fiction, writers, with, former, usually, often, not, having, been, able, to, get, access, to, hanja, education, in, 1504, the, study, and, publication, of, hangul, was, banned, by, yeonsangun, its, spread, and, preservation, can, be, largely, attributed, to, three, main, factors, books, published, for, women, its, use, by, buddhist, monks, and, the, introduction, of, christianity, in, korea, in, 1602, hangul, was, brought, into, the, mainstream, culture, in, the, 16th, century, due, to, a, renaissance, in, literature, and, poetry, it, continued, to, gain, popularity, well, into, the, 17th, century, and, gained, wider, use, after, a, period, of, nationalism, in, the, 19th, century, in, 1849, it, was, adopted, as, korea, s, national, writing, system, and, saw, its, first, use, in, official, government, documents, after, the, treaty, of, 1910, hangul, was, outlawed, again, until, the, liberation, of, korea, in, 1945, sejong, suffered, from, eye, diseases, and, deteriorating, vision, and, likely, had, health, issues, linked, to, excessive, meat, consumption, all, throughout, his, life, sejong, s, love, for, meat, is, clear, from, a, comment, by, king, emeritus, taejong, when, sejong, stopped, eating, fish, and, meat, to, mourn, after, the, death, of, jeongjong, sejong, s, uncle, and,

there, is, also, an, account, of, sejong, s, having, a, disease, that, roughly, translates, to, palsy, and, essential, tremor, but, terminology, of, the, 15th, century, korean, traditional, medicine,
