the, oldest, being, urraca, henriques, according, to, the, cr, nica, de, portugal, de, 1419, the, future, portuguese, king, was, born, in, guimar, es, which, was, at, the, time, the, most, important, political, centre, of, his, parents, this, was, accepted, by, most, portuguese, scholars, until, 1990, when, torquato, de, sousa, soares, proposed, coimbra, the, centre, of, the, county, of, coimbra, and, another, political, centre, of, afonso, s, progenitors, as, his, birthplace, which, caused, outrage, in, guimar, es, and, a, polemic, between, this, historian, and, jos, hermano, saraiva, almeida, fernandes, later, proposed, viseu, as, the, birthplace, of, afonso, based, on, the, chronica, gothorum, which, states, afonso, was, born, in, 1109, a, position, followed, by, historian, jos, mattoso, in, his, biography, of, the, king, regardless, of, this, it, is, widely, accepted, that, afonso, was, born, in, guimar, es, abel, estef, nio, has, suggested, a, different, date, and, thesis, proposing, 1106, as, the, birth, date, and, the, region, of, tierra, de, campos, or, even, sahag, n, as, likely, birth, places, based, on, the, known, itineraries, of, henry, and, teresa, his, place, of, baptism, is, also, under, suspicion, according, to, tradition, the, place, is, indicated, as, being, in, the, church, of, s, o, miguel, do, castelo, in, guimar, es, however, there, are, doubts, because, of, the, date, of, the, consecration, of, the, church, made, in, 1239, there, are, those, who, argue, that, the, baptism, actually, took, place, in, the, cathedral, of, braga, where, he, was, baptised, by, primate, archbishop, saint, gerald, of, braga, which, is, politically, sound, for, count, henry, to, have, the, highest, ranking, clergy, baptise, his, heir, henry, and, theresa, reigned, jointly, as, count, and, countess, of, portugal, until, his, death, on, 22, may, 1112, during, the, siege, of, astorga, after, which, theresa, ruled, portugal, alone, she, would, proclaim, herself, queen, a, claim, recognised, by, pope, paschal, ii, in, 1116, but, was, captured, and, forced, to, reaffirm, her, vassalage, to, her, half, sister, urraca, of, le, n, it, is, not, known, who, was, the, tutor, of, afonso, later, traditions, probably, started, with, jo, o, soares, coelho, a, bastard, descendant, of, egas, moniz, through, a, female, line, in, the, mid, 13th, century, and, ampliated, by, later, chronicles, such, as, the, cr, nica, de, portugal, de, 1419, asserted, he, had, been, egas, moniz, de, ribadouro, possibly, with, the, help, of, oral, memories, that, associated, the, tutor, to, the, house, of, ribadouro, yet, contemporary, documents, namely, from, the, chancery, of, afonso, in, his, early, years, as, count, of, portucale, indicate, according, to, mattoso, that, the, most, likely, tutor, of, afonso, henriques, was, egas, moniz, s, oldest, brother, erm, gio, moniz, who, besides, being, the, senior, brother, within, the, family, of, ribadouro, became, the, dapifer, and, majordomus, of, afonso, i, from, 1128, until, his, death, in, 1135, which, indicates, his, closer, proximity, to, the, prince, in, an, effort, to, pursue, a, larger, share, in, the, leonese, inheritance, his, mother, teresa, joined, forces, with, fernando, p, rez, de, trava, the, most, powerful, count, in, galicia, the, portuguese, nobility, disliked, the, alliance, between, galicia, and, portugal, and, rallied, around, afonso, the, archbishop, of, braga, maurice, bourdin, was, also, concerned, with, the, dominance, of, galicia, apprehensive, of, the, ecclesiastical, pretensions, of, his, new, rival, the, galician, archbishop, of, santiago, de, compostela, diego, gelm, rez, who, had, claimed, an, alleged, discovery, of, relics, of, saint, james, in, his, town, as, a, way, to, gain, power, and, riches, over, the, other, cathedrals, in, the, iberian, peninsula, in, order, to, stop, her, son, afonso, from, overthrowing, her, teresa, exiled, him, when, he, was, twelve, in, the, year, 1120, in, 1122, afonso, turned, fourteen, the, adult, age, in, the, 12th, century, in, symmetry, with, his, cousin, afonso, made, himself, a, knight, on, his, own, account, in, the, cathedral, of, zamora, in, 1125, after, the, military, campaign, of, alfonso, vii, against, his, mother, in, 1127, afonso, revolted, against, her, and, proceeded, to, take, control, of, the, county, from, its, queen, in, 1128, near, guimar, es, at, the, battle, of, s, o, mamede, afonso, and, his, supporters, overcame, troops, under, both, his, mother, and, her, lover, count, fernando, p, rez, de, traba, of, galicia, afonso, exiled, his, mother, to, galicia, and, took, over, rule, of, the, county, of, portucale, thus, the, possibility, of, re, incorporating, portucale, into, a, kingdom, of, portugal, and, galicia, as, before, was, eliminated, and, afonso, became, sole, ruler, following, demands, for, greater, independence, from, the, county, s, church, and, nobles, the, battle, was, mostly, ignored, by, the, leonese, suzerain, who, was, occupied, at, the, time, with, a, revolt, in, castille, he, was, also, most, likely, waiting, for, the, reaction, of, the, galician, families, after, teresa, s, death, in, 1131, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, proceeded, to, demand, vassalage, from, his, cousin, on, 6, april, 1129, afonso, henriques, dictated, the, writ, in, which, he, proclaimed, himself, prince, of, portugal, or, prince, of, the, portuguese, an, act, informally, allowed, by, afonso, vii, as, it, was, thought, to, be, afonso, henriques, s, right, by, blood, as, one, of, two, grandsons, of, the, emperor, of, hispania, afonso, then, turned, his, arms, against, the, persistent, problem, of, the, moors, in, the, south, his, campaigns, were, successful, and, on, 25, july, 1139, he, obtained, an, overwhelming, victory, in, the, battle, of, ourique, and, straight, after, was, possibly, unanimously, proclaimed, king, of, the, portuguese, by, his, soldiers, establishing, his, equality, in, rank, to, the, other, realms, of, the, peninsula, although, the, first, reference, to, his, royal, title, dates, from, 1140, the, first, assembly, of, the, portuguese, cortes, convened, at, lamego, wherein, he, would, have, been, given, the, crown, from, the, archbishop, of, braga, to, confirm, his, independence, is, a, 17th, century, embellishment, of, portuguese, history, complete, independence, from, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, s, suzerainty, however, could, not, be, achieved, by, military, means, alone, the, county, of, portugal, still, had, to, be, acknowledged, diplomatically, by, the, neighboring, lands, as, a, kingdom, and, most, importantly, by, the, catholic, church, and, the, pope, afonso, wed, mafalda, of, savoy, daughter, of, count, amadeus, iii, of, savoy, and, sent, ambassadors, to, rome, to, negotiate, with, the, pope, he, succeeded, in, renouncing, the, suzerainty, of, his, cousin, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, becoming, instead, a, vassal, of, the, papacy, as, the, kings, of, sicily, and, aragon, had, done, before, him, in, portugal, he, built, several, monasteries, and, convents, and, bestowed, important, privileges, to, religious, orders, he, is, notably, the, builder, of, alcoba, a, monastery, to, which, he, called, the, cistercian, order, of, his, uncle, bernard, of, clairvaux, of, burgundy, in, 1143, he, wrote, to, pope, innocent, ii, to, declare, himself, and, the, kingdom, servants, of, the, church, swearing, to, pursue, driving, the, moors, out, of, the, iberian, peninsula, bypassing, any, king, of, le, n, afonso, declared, himself, the, direct, liege, man, of, the, papacy, afonso, continued, to, distinguish, himself, by, his, exploits, against, the, moors, from, whom, he, wrested, santar, m, see, conquest, of, santar, m, and, lisbon, in, 1147, see, siege, of, lisbon, he, also, conquered, an, important, part, of, the, land, south, of, the, tagus, river, although, this, was, lost, again, to, the, moors, in, the, following, years, meanwhile, king, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, regarded, the, independent, ruler, of, portugal, as, nothing, but, a, rebel, conflict, between, the, two, was, constant, and, bitter, in, the, following, years, afonso, became, involved, in, a, war, taking, the, side, of, the, aragonese, king, an, enemy, of, castile, to, ensure, the, alliance, his, son, sancho, was, engaged, to, dulce, of, aragon, finally, after, winning, the, battle, of, valdevez, the, treaty, of, zamora, 1143, established, peace, between, the, cousins, and, the, recognition, by, the, kingdom, of, le, n, that, portugal, was, a, fully, independent, kingdom, in, 1169, the, now, old, king, afonso, was, possibly, disabled, in, an, engagement, near, badajoz, by, a, fall, from, his, horse, and, slamming, against, the, castle, gate, and, made, prisoner, by, the, soldiers, of, king, ferdinand, ii, of, le, n, his, son, in, law, he, spent, months, at, the, hot, springs, of, s, o, pedro, do, sul, but, never, recovered, and, from, this, time, onward, the, portuguese, king, never, rode, a, horse, again, however, it, is, not, certain, if, this, was, because, of, the, disability, according, to, the, later, portuguese, chronistic, tradition, this, happened, because, afonso, would, have, to, surrender, himself, again, to, ferdinand, or, risk, war, between, the, two, kingdoms, if, he, ever, rode, a, horse, again, portugal, was, obliged, to, surrender, as, his, ransom, almost, all, the, conquests, afonso, had, made, in, galicia, north, of, the, minho, river, in, the, previous, years, this, event, became, known, in, portuguese, history, as, the, disaster, of, badajoz, o, desastre, de, badajoz, in, 1179, the, privileges, and, favors, given, to, the, catholic, church, were, compensated, with, consistent, effort, by, several, parties, such, as, the, primate, archbishop, of, braga, paio, mendes, in, the, papal, court, the, papal, bull, manifestis, probatum, was, promulgated, accepting, the, new, king, as, vassal, to, the, pope, exclusively, in, it, pope, alexander, iii, also, acknowledged, afonso, as, king, and, portugal, as, an, independent, kingdom, with, the, right, to, conquer, lands, from, the, moors, in, 1184, the, almohad, caliph, abu, yaqub, yusuf, rallied, a, great, almohad, force, to, retaliate, against, the, portuguese, raids, done, since, the, end, of, a, five, year, truce, in, 1178, and, besieged, santar, m, which, was, defended, by, afonso, s, son, sancho, the, almohad, siege, failed, when, news, arrived, the, archbishop, of, compostella, had, come, to, the, defense, of, the, city, and, fernando, ii, of, le, n, himself, with, his, army, the, almohads, ended, the, siege, and, their, retreat, turned, into, a, rout, due, to, panic, in, their, camp, with, the, almohad, caliph, being, injured, in, the, process, according, to, one, version, because, of, a, crossbow, bolt, and, dying, on, the, way, back, to, seville, afonso, died, shortly, after, on, 6, december, 1185, the, portuguese, revere, him, as, a, hero, both, on, account, of, his, personal, character, and, as, the, founder, of, their, nation, there, are, mythical, stories, that, it, took, ten, men, to, carry, his, sword, and, that, afonso, wanted, to, engage, other, monarchs, in, personal, combat, but, no, one, would, dare, accept, his, challenge, it, is, also, told, despite, his, honourable, character, that, he, had, a, temper, several, chronicles, give, the, example, of, a, papal, legate, that, brought, a, message, from, pope, paschal, ii, refusing, to, acknowledge, afonso, s, claim, as, king, either, after, committing, or, saying, a, small, offense, against, him, or, after, being, simply, read, the, letter, afonso, almost, killed, in, his, rage, the, papal, representative, and, it, took, several, portuguese, nobles, and, soldiers, to, physically, restrain, the, young, would, be, king, in, july, 2006, the, tomb, of, the, king, which, is, located, in, the, santa, cruz, monastery, in, coimbra, was, to, be, opened, for, scientific, purposes, by, researchers, from, the, university, of, coimbra, portugal, and, the, university, of, granada, spain, the, opening, of, the, tomb, provoked, considerable, concern, among, some, sectors, of, portuguese, society, and, portuguese, state, agency, for, architectural, patrimony, instituto, portugu, s, do, patrim, nio, arquitect, nico, ippar, halted, the, opening, requesting, more, protocols, from, the, scientific, team, because, of, the, importance, of, the, king, in, the, nation, s, heart, and, public, thought, in, 1146, afonso, married, mafalda, daughter, of, amadeus, iii, count, of, savoy, and, mahaut, of, albon, both, appearing, together, for, the, first, time, in, may, of, that, year,
