leonhard, euler, l, r, oy, l, r, german, swiss, standard, german, 15, april, 1707, 18, september, 1783, was, a, swiss, mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician, and, engineer, who, founded, the, studies, of, graph, theory, and, topology, and, made, pioneering, and, influential, discoveries, in, many, other, branches, of, mathematics, such, as, analytic, number, theory, complex, analysis, and, infinitesimal, calculus, he, introduced, much, of, modern, mathematical, terminology, and, notation, including, the, notion, of, a, mathematical, function, he, is, also, known, for, his, work, in, mechanics, fluid, dynamics, optics, astronomy, and, music, theory, euler, is, held, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, most, prolific, mathematicians, in, history, and, the, greatest, of, the, 18th, century, several, great, mathematicians, who, produced, their, work, after, euler, s, death, have, recognised, his, importance, in, the, field, as, shown, by, quotes, attributed, to, many, of, them, pierre, simon, laplace, expressed, euler, s, influence, on, mathematics, by, stating, read, euler, read, euler, he, is, the, master, of, us, all, carl, friedrich, gauss, wrote, the, study, of, euler, s, works, will, remain, the, best, school, for, the, different, fields, of, mathematics, and, nothing, else, can, replace, it, his, 866, publications, as, well, as, his, correspondences, are, being, collected, in, the, opera, omnia, leonhard, euler, which, when, completed, will, consist, of, 81, quartos, he, spent, most, of, his, adult, life, in, saint, petersburg, russia, and, in, berlin, then, the, capital, of, prussia, euler, is, credited, for, popularizing, the, greek, letter, displaystyle, pi, lowercase, pi, to, denote, the, ratio, of, a, circle, s, circumference, to, its, diameter, as, well, as, first, using, the, notation, f, x, displaystyle, f, x, for, the, value, of, a, function, the, letter, i, displaystyle, i, to, express, the, imaginary, unit, 1, displaystyle, sqrt, 1, the, greek, letter, displaystyle, sigma, capital, sigma, to, express, summations, the, greek, letter, displaystyle, delta, capital, delta, for, finite, differences, and, lowercase, letters, to, represent, the, sides, of, a, triangle, while, representing, the, angles, as, capital, letters, he, gave, the, current, definition, of, the, constant, e, displaystyle, e, the, base, of, the, natural, logarithm, now, known, as, euler, s, number, euler, is, also, credited, with, being, the, first, to, develop, graph, theory, partly, as, a, solution, for, the, problem, of, the, seven, bridges, of, k, nigsberg, which, is, also, considered, the, first, practical, application, of, topology, he, also, became, famous, for, among, many, other, accomplishments, providing, a, solution, to, several, unsolved, problems, in, number, theory, and, analysis, including, the, famous, basel, problem, euler, has, also, been, credited, for, discovering, that, the, sum, of, the, numbers, of, vertices, and, faces, minus, the, number, of, edges, of, a, polyhedron, equals, 2, a, number, now, commonly, known, as, the, euler, characteristic, in, the, field, of, physics, euler, reformulated, newton, s, laws, of, physics, into, new, laws, in, his, two, volume, work, mechanica, to, better, explain, the, motion, of, rigid, bodies, he, also, made, substantial, contributions, to, the, study, of, elastic, deformations, of, solid, objects, leonhard, euler, was, born, on, 15, april, 1707, in, basel, to, paul, iii, euler, a, pastor, of, the, reformed, church, and, marguerite, n, e, brucker, whose, ancestors, include, a, number, of, well, known, scholars, in, the, classics, he, was, the, oldest, of, four, children, having, two, younger, sisters, anna, maria, and, maria, magdalena, and, a, younger, brother, johann, heinrich, soon, after, the, birth, of, leonhard, the, euler, family, moved, from, basel, to, the, town, of, riehen, switzerland, where, his, father, became, pastor, in, the, local, church, and, leonhard, spent, most, of, his, childhood, from, a, young, age, euler, received, schooling, in, mathematics, from, his, father, who, had, taken, courses, from, jacob, bernoulli, some, years, earlier, at, the, university, of, basel, around, the, age, of, eight, euler, was, sent, to, live, at, his, maternal, grandmother, s, house, and, enrolled, in, the, latin, school, in, basel, in, addition, he, received, private, tutoring, from, johannes, burckhardt, a, young, theologian, with, a, keen, interest, in, mathematics, in, 1720, at, thirteen, years, of, age, euler, enrolled, at, the, university, of, basel, attending, university, at, such, a, young, age, was, not, unusual, at, the, time, the, course, on, elementary, mathematics, was, given, by, johann, bernoulli, the, younger, brother, of, the, deceased, jacob, bernoulli, who, had, taught, euler, s, father, johann, bernoulli, and, euler, soon, got, to, know, each, other, better, euler, described, bernoulli, in, his, autobiography, it, was, during, this, time, that, euler, backed, by, bernoulli, obtained, his, father, s, consent, to, become, a, mathematician, instead, of, a, pastor, in, 1723, euler, received, a, master, of, philosophy, with, a, dissertation, that, compared, the, philosophies, of, ren, descartes, and, isaac, newton, afterwards, he, enrolled, in, the, theological, faculty, of, the, university, of, basel, in, 1726, euler, completed, a, dissertation, on, the, propagation, of, sound, with, the, title, de, sono, with, which, he, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, obtain, a, position, at, the, university, of, basel, in, 1727, he, entered, the, paris, academy, prize, competition, offered, annually, and, later, biennially, by, the, academy, beginning, in, 1720, for, the, first, time, the, problem, posed, that, year, was, to, find, the, best, way, to, place, the, masts, on, a, ship, pierre, bouguer, who, became, known, as, the, father, of, naval, architecture, won, and, euler, took, second, place, over, the, years, euler, entered, this, competition, 15, times, winning, 12, of, them, johann, bernoulli, s, two, sons, daniel, and, nicolaus, entered, into, service, at, the, imperial, russian, academy, of, sciences, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1725, leaving, euler, with, the, assurance, they, would, recommend, him, to, a, post, when, one, was, available, on, 31, july, 1726, nicolaus, died, of, appendicitis, after, spending, less, than, a, year, in, russia, when, daniel, assumed, his, brother, s, position, in, the, mathematics, physics, division, he, recommended, that, the, post, in, physiology, that, he, had, vacated, be, filled, by, his, friend, euler, in, november, 1726, euler, eagerly, accepted, the, offer, but, delayed, making, the, trip, to, saint, petersburg, while, he, unsuccessfully, applied, for, a, physics, professorship, at, the, university, of, basel, euler, arrived, in, saint, petersburg, in, may, 1727, he, was, promoted, from, his, junior, post, in, the, medical, department, of, the, academy, to, a, position, in, the, mathematics, department, he, lodged, with, daniel, bernoulli, with, whom, he, worked, in, close, collaboration, euler, mastered, russian, settled, into, life, in, saint, petersburg, and, took, on, an, additional, job, as, a, medic, in, the, russian, navy, the, academy, at, saint, petersburg, established, by, peter, the, great, was, intended, to, improve, education, in, russia, and, to, close, the, scientific, gap, with, western, europe, as, a, result, it, was, made, especially, attractive, to, foreign, scholars, like, euler, the, academy, s, benefactress, catherine, i, who, had, continued, the, progressive, policies, of, her, late, husband, died, before, euler, s, arrival, to, saint, petersburg, the, russian, conservative, nobility, then, gained, power, upon, the, ascension, of, the, twelve, year, old, peter, ii, the, nobility, suspicious, of, the, academy, s, foreign, scientists, cut, funding, for, euler, and, his, colleagues, and, prevented, the, entrance, of, foreign, and, non, aristocratic, students, into, the, gymnasium, and, universities, conditions, improved, slightly, after, the, death, of, peter, ii, in, 1730, and, the, german, influenced, anna, of, russia, assumed, power, euler, swiftly, rose, through, the, ranks, in, the, academy, and, was, made, a, professor, of, physics, in, 1731, he, also, left, the, russian, navy, refusing, a, promotion, to, lieutenant, two, years, later, daniel, bernoulli, fed, up, with, the, censorship, and, hostility, he, faced, at, saint, petersburg, left, for, basel, euler, succeeded, him, as, the, head, of, the, mathematics, department, in, january, 1734, he, married, katharina, gsell, 1707, 1773, a, daughter, of, georg, gsell, frederick, ii, had, made, an, attempt, to, recruit, the, services, of, euler, for, his, newly, established, berlin, academy, in, 1740, but, euler, initially, preferred, to, stay, in, st, petersburg, but, after, empress, anna, died, and, frederick, ii, agreed, to, pay, 1600, ecus, the, same, as, euler, earned, in, russia, he, agreed, to, move, to, berlin, in, 1741, he, requested, permission, to, leave, to, berlin, arguing, he, was, in, need, of, a, milder, climate, for, his, eyesight, the, russian, academy, gave, its, consent, and, would, pay, him, 200, rubles, per, year, as, one, of, its, active, members, concerned, about, the, continuing, turmoil, in, russia, euler, left, st, petersburg, in, june, 1741, to, take, up, a, post, at, the, berlin, academy, which, he, had, been, offered, by, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, he, lived, for, 25, years, in, berlin, where, he, wrote, several, hundred, articles, in, 1748, his, text, on, functions, called, the, introductio, in, analysin, infinitorum, was, published, and, in, 1755, a, text, on, differential, calculus, called, the, institutiones, calculi, differentialis, was, published, in, 1755, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, and, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, notable, students, of, euler, in, berlin, included, stepan, rumovsky, later, considered, as, the, first, russian, astronomer, in, 1748, he, declined, an, offer, from, the, university, of, basel, to, succeed, the, recently, deceased, johann, bernoulli, in, 1753, he, bought, a, house, in, charlottenburg, in, which, he, lived, with, his, family, and, widowed, mother, euler, became, the, tutor, for, friederike, charlotte, of, brandenburg, schwedt, the, princess, of, anhalt, dessau, and, frederick, s, niece, he, wrote, over, 200, letters, to, her, in, the, early, 1760s, which, were, later, compiled, into, a, volume, entitled, letters, of, euler, on, different, subjects, in, natural, philosophy, addressed, to, a, german, princess, this, work, contained, euler, s, exposition, on, various, subjects, pertaining, to, physics, and, mathematics, and, offered, valuable, insights, into, euler, s, personality, and, religious, beliefs, it, was, translated, into, multiple, languages, published, across, europe, and, in, the, united, states, and, became, more, widely, read, than, any, of, his, mathematical, works, the, popularity, of, the, letters, testifies, to, euler, s, ability, to, communicate, scientific, matters, effectively, to, a, lay, audience, a, rare, ability, for, a, dedicated, research, scientist, despite, euler, s, immense, contribution, to, the, academy, s, prestige, and, having, been, put, forward, as, a, candidate, for, its, presidency, by, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, frederick, ii, named, himself, as, its, president, the, prussian, king, had, a, large, circle, of, intellectuals, in, his, court, and, he, found, the, mathematician, unsophisticated, and, ill, informed, on, matters, beyond, numbers, and, figures, euler, was, a, simple, devoutly, religious, man, who, never, questioned, the, existing, social, order, or, conventional, beliefs, he, was, in, many, ways, the, polar, opposite, of, voltaire, who, enjoyed, a, high, place, of, prestige, at, frederick, s, court, euler, was, not, a, skilled, debater, and, often, made, it, a, point, to, argue, subjects, that, he, knew, little, about, making, him, the, frequent, target, of, voltaire, s, wit, frederick, also, expressed, disappointment, with, euler, s, practical, engineering, abilities, stating, i, wanted, to, have, a, water, jet, in, my, garden, euler, calculated, the, force, of, the, wheels, necessary, to, raise, the, water, to, a, reservoir, from, where, it, should, fall, back, through, channels, finally, spurting, out, in, sanssouci, my, mill, was, carried, out, geometrically, and, could, not, raise, a, mouthful, of, water, closer, than, fifty, paces, to, the, reservoir, vanity, of, vanities, vanity, of, geometry, however, the, disappointment, was, almost, surely, unwarranted, from, a, technical, perspective, euler, s, calculations, look, likely, to, be, correct, even, if, euler, s, interactions, with, frederick, and, those, constructing, his, fountain, may, have, been, dysfunctional, throughout, his, stay, in, berlin, euler, maintained, a, strong, connection, to, the, academy, in, st, petersburg, and, also, published, 109, papers, in, russia, he, also, assisted, students, from, the, st, petersburg, academy, and, at, times, accommodated, russian, students, in, his, house, in, berlin, in, 1760, with, the, seven, years, war, raging, euler, s, farm, in, charlottenburg, was, sacked, by, advancing, russian, troops, upon, learning, of, this, event, general, ivan, petrovich, saltykov, paid, compensation, for, the, damage, caused, to, euler, s, estate, with, empress, elizabeth, of, russia, later, adding, a, further, payment, of, 4000, rubles, an, exorbitant, amount, at, the, time, euler, decided, to, leave, berlin, in, 1766, and, return, to, russia, during, his, berlin, years, 1741, 1766, euler, was, at, the, peak, of, his, productivity, he, wrote, 380, works, 275, of, which, were, published, this, included, 125, memoirs, in, the, berlin, academy, and, over, 100, memoirs, sent, to, the, st, petersburg, academy, which, had, retained, him, as, a, member, and, paid, him, an, annual, stipend, euler, s, introductio, in, analysin, infinitorum, was, published, in, two, parts, in, 1748, in, addition, to, his, own, research, euler, supervised, the, library, the, observatory, the, botanical, garden, and, the, publication, of, calendars, and, maps, from, which, the, academy, derived, income, he, was, even, involved, in, the, design, of, the, water, fountains, at, sanssouci, the, king, s, summer, palace, the, political, situation, in, russia, stabilized, after, catherine, the, great, s, accession, to, the, throne, so, in, 1766, euler, accepted, an, invitation, to, return, to, the, st, petersburg, academy, his, conditions, were, quite, exorbitant, a, 3000, ruble, annual, salary, a, pension, for, his, wife, and, the, promise, of, high, ranking, appointments, for, his, sons, at, the, university, he, was, assisted, by, his, student, anders, johan, lexell, while, living, in, st, petersburg, a, fire, in, 1771, destroyed, his, home, on, 7, january, 1734, he, married, katharina, gsell, 1707, 1773, daughter, of, georg, gsell, a, painter, from, the, academy, gymnasium, in, saint, petersburg, the, young, couple, bought, a, house, by, the, neva, river, of, their, thirteen, children, only, five, survived, childhood, three, sons, and, two, daughters, their, first, son, was, johann, albrecht, euler, whose, godfather, was, christian, goldbach, three, years, after, his, wife, s, death, in, 1773, euler, married, her, half, sister, salome, abigail, gsell, 1723, 1794, this, marriage, lasted, until, his, death, in, 1783, his, brother, johann, heinrich, settled, in, st, petersburg, in, 1735, and, was, employed, as, a, painter, at, the, academy, euler, s, eyesight, worsened, throughout, his, mathematical, career, in, 1738, three, years, after, nearly, expiring, from, fever, he, became, almost, blind, in, his, right, eye, euler, blamed, the, cartography, he, performed, for, the, st, petersburg, academy, for, his, condition, but, the, cause, of, his, blindness, remains, the, subject, of, speculation, euler, s, vision, in, that, eye, worsened, throughout, his, stay, in, germany, to, the, extent, that, frederick, referred, to, him, as, cyclops, euler, remarked, on, his, loss, of, vision, stating, now, i, will, have, fewer, distractions, in, 1766, a, cataract, in, his, left, eye, was, discovered, though, couching, of, the, cataract, temporarily, improved, his, vision, complications, ultimately, rendered, him, almost, totally, blind, in, the, left, eye, as, well, however, his, condition, appeared, to, have, little, effect, on, his, productivity, with, the, aid, of, his, scribes, euler, s, productivity, in, many, areas, of, study, increased, and, in, 1775, he, produced, on, average, one, mathematical, paper, every, week, in, st, petersburg, on, 18, september, 1783, after, a, lunch, with, his, family, euler, was, discussing, the, newly, discovered, planet, uranus, and, its, orbit, with, anders, johan, lexell, when, he, collapsed, and, died, from, a, brain, hemorrhage, jacob, von, staehlin, wrote, a, short, obituary, for, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, and, russian, mathematician, nicolas, fuss, one, of, euler, s, disciples, wrote, a, more, detailed, eulogy, which, he, delivered, at, a, memorial, meeting, in, his, eulogy, for, the, french, academy, french, mathematician, and, philosopher, marquis, de, condorcet, wrote, il, cessa, de, calculer, et, de, vivre, he, ceased, to, calculate, and, to, live, euler, was, buried, next, to, katharina, at, the, smolensk, lutheran, cemetery, on, vasilievsky, island, in, 1837, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, installed, a, new, monument, replacing, his, overgrown, grave, plaque, to, commemorate, the, 250th, anniversary, of, euler, s, birth, in, 1957, his, tomb, was, moved, to, the, lazarevskoe, cemetery, at, the, alexander, nevsky, monastery, euler, worked, in, almost, all, areas, of, mathematics, including, geometry, infinitesimal, calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and, number, theory, as, well, as, continuum, physics, lunar, theory, and, other, areas, of, physics, he, is, a, seminal, figure, in, the, history, of, mathematics, if, printed, his, works, many, of, which, are, of, fundamental, interest, would, occupy, between, 60, and, 80, quarto, volumes, euler, s, name, is, associated, with, a, large, number, of, topics, euler, s, work, averages, 800, pages, a, year, from, 1725, to, 1783, he, also, wrote, over, 4500, letters, and, hundreds, of, manuscripts, it, has, been, estimated, that, leonhard, euler, was, the, author, of, a, quarter, of, the, combined, output, in, mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and, navigation, in, the, 18th, century, euler, introduced, and, popularized, several, notational, conventions, through, his, numerous, and, widely, circulated, textbooks, most, notably, he, introduced, the, concept, of, a, function, and, was, the, first, to, write, f, x, to, denote, the, function, f, applied, to, the, argument, x, he, also, introduced, the, modern, notation, for, the, trigonometric, functions, the, letter, e, for, the, base, of, the, natural, logarithm, now, also, known, as, euler, s, number, the, greek, letter, for, summations, and, the, letter, i, to, denote, the, imaginary, unit, the, use, of, the, greek, letter, to, denote, the, ratio, of, a, circle, s, circumference, to, its, diameter, was, also, popularized, by, euler, although, it, originated, with, welsh, mathematician, william, jones, the, development, of, infinitesimal, calculus, was, at, the, forefront, of, 18th, century, mathematical, research, and, the, bernoullis, family, friends, of, euler, were, responsible, for, much, of, the, early, progress, in, the, field, thanks, to, their, influence, studying, calculus, became, the, major, focus, of, euler, s, work, while, some, of, euler, s, proofs, are, not, acceptable, by, modern, standards, of, mathematical, rigour, in, particular, his, reliance, on, the, principle, of, the, generality, of, algebra, his, ideas, led, to, many, great, advances, euler, is, well, known, in, analysis, for, his, frequent, use, and, development, of, power, series, the, expression, of, functions, as, sums, of, infinitely, many, terms, such, as, e, x, n, 0, x, n, n, lim, n, 1, 0, x, 1, x, 2, 2, x, n, n, displaystyle, e, x, sum, n, 0, infty, x, n, over, n, lim, n, to, infty, left, frac, 1, 0, frac, x, 1, frac, x, 2, 2, cdots, frac, x, n, n, right, euler, s, use, of, power, series, enabled, him, to, solve, the, basel, problem, finding, the, sum, of, the, reciprocals, of, squares, of, every, natural, number, in, 1735, he, provided, a, more, elaborate, argument, in, 1741, the, basel, problem, was, originally, posed, by, pietro, mengoli, in, 1644, and, by, the, 1730s, was, a, famous, open, problem, popularized, by, jacob, bernoulli, and, unsuccessfully, attacked, by, many, of, the, leading, mathematicians, of, the, time, euler, found, that, n, 1, 1, n, 2, lim, n, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, n, 2, 2, 6, displaystyle, sum, n, 1, infty, 1, over, n, 2, lim, n,

displaystyle, gamma, lim, n, rightarrow, infty, left, 1, frac, 1, 2, frac, 1, 3, frac, 1, 4, cdots, frac, 1, n, ln, n, right, approx, 0, 5772, now, known, as, euler, s, constant, or, the, euler, mascheroni, constant, and, studied, its, relationship, with, the, harmonic, series, the, gamma, function, and, values, of, the, riemann, zeta, function, euler, introduced, the, use, of, the, exponential, function, and, logarithms, in, analytic, proofs, he, discovered, ways, to, express, various, logarithmic, functions, using, power, series, and, he, successfully, defined, logarithms, for, negative, and, complex, numbers, thus, greatly, expanding, the, scope, of, mathematical, applications, of, logarithms, he, also, defined, the, exponential, function, for, complex, numbers, and, discovered, its, relation, to, the, trigonometric, functions, for, any, real, number, taken, to, be, radians, euler, s, formula, states, that, the, complex, exponential, function, satisfies, e, i, cos, i, sin, displaystyle, e, i, varphi, cos, varphi, i, sin, varphi, which, was, called, the, most, remarkable, formula, in, mathematics, by, richard, p, feynman, a, special, case, of, the, above, formula, is, known, as, euler, s, identity, e, i, 1, 0, displaystyle, e, i, pi, 1, 0, euler, elaborated, the, theory, of, higher, transcendental, functions, by, introducing, the, gamma, function, and, introduced, a, new, method, for, solving, quartic, equations, he, found, a, way, to, calculate, integrals, with, complex, limits, foreshadowing, the, development, of, modern, complex, analysis, he, invented, the, calculus, of, variations, and, formulated, the, euler, lagrange, equation, for, reducing, optimization, problems, in, this, area, to, the, solution, of, differential, equations, euler, pioneered, the, use, of, analytic, methods, to, solve, number, theory, problems, in, doing, so, he, united, two, disparate, branches, of, mathematics, and, introduced, a, new, field, of, study, analytic, number, theory, in, breaking, ground, for, this, new, field, euler, created, the, theory, of, hypergeometric, series, q, series, hyperbolic, trigonometric, functions, and, the, analytic, theory, of, continued, fractions, for, example, he, proved, the, infinitude, of, primes, using, the, divergence, of, the, harmonic, series, and, he, used, analytic, methods, to, gain, some, understanding, of, the, way, prime, numbers, are, distributed, euler, s, work, in, this, area, led, to, the, development, of, the, prime, number, theorem, euler, s, interest, in, number, theory, can, be, traced, to, the, influence, of, christian, goldbach, his, friend, in, the, st, petersburg, academy, much, of, euler, s, early, work, on, number, theory, was, based, on, the, work, of, pierre, de, fermat, euler, developed, some, of, fermat, s, ideas, and, disproved, some, of, his, conjectures, such, as, his, conjecture, that, all, numbers, of, the, form, 2, 2, n, 1, textstyle, 2, 2, n, 1, fermat, numbers, are, prime, euler, linked, the, nature, of, prime, distribution, with, ideas, in, analysis, he, proved, that, the, sum, of, the, reciprocals, of, the, primes, diverges, in, doing, so, he, discovered, the, connection, between, the, riemann, zeta, function, and, prime, numbers, this, is, known, as, the, euler, product, formula, for, the, riemann, zeta, function, euler, invented, the, totient, function, n, the, number, of, positive, integers, less, than, or, equal, to, the, integer, n, that, are, coprime, to, n, using, properties, of, this, function, he, generalized, fermat, s, little, theorem, to, what, is, now, known, as, euler, s, theorem, he, contributed, significantly, to, the, theory, of, perfect, numbers, which, had, fascinated, mathematicians, since, euclid, he, proved, that, the, relationship, shown, between, even, perfect, numbers, and, mersenne, primes, which, he, had, earlier, proved, was, one, to, one, a, result, otherwise, known, as, the, euclid, euler, theorem, euler, also, conjectured, the, law, of, quadratic, reciprocity, the, concept, is, regarded, as, a, fundamental, theorem, within, number, theory, and, his, ideas, paved, the, way, for, the, work, of, carl, friedrich, gauss, particularly, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, by, 1772, euler, had, proved, that, 2, 31, 1, 2, 147, 483, 647, is, a, mersenne, prime, it, may, have, remained, the, largest, known, prime, until, 1867, euler, also, contributed, major, developments, to, the, theory, of, partitions, of, an, integer, in, 1735, euler, presented, a, solution, to, the, problem, known, as, the, seven, bridges, of, k, nigsberg, the, city, of, k, nigsberg, prussia, was, set, on, the, pregel, river, and, included, two, large, islands, that, were, connected, to, each, other, and, the, mainland, by, seven, bridges, the, problem, is, to, decide, whether, it, is, possible, to, follow, a, path, that, crosses, each, bridge, exactly, once, and, returns, to, the, starting, point, it, is, not, possible, there, is, no, eulerian, circuit, this, solution, is, considered, to, be, the, first, theorem, of, graph, theory, euler, also, discovered, the, formula, v, e, f, 2, displaystyle, v, e, f, 2, relating, the, number, of, vertices, edges, and, faces, of, a, convex, polyhedron, and, hence, of, a, planar, graph, the, constant, in, this, formula, is, now, known, as, the, euler, characteristic, for, the, graph, or, other, mathematical, object, and, is, related, to, the, genus, of, the, object, the, study, and, generalization, of, this, formula, specifically, by, cauchy, and, l, huilier, is, at, the, origin, of, topology, some, of, euler, s, greatest, successes, were, in, solving, real, world, problems, analytically, and, in, describing, numerous, applications, of, the, bernoulli, numbers, fourier, series, euler, numbers, the, constants, e, and, continued, fractions, and, integrals, he, integrated, leibniz, s, differential, calculus, with, newton, s, method, of, fluxions, and, developed, tools, that, made, it, easier, to, apply, calculus, to, physical, problems, he, made, great, strides, in, improving, the, numerical, approximation, of, integrals, inventing, what, are, now, known, as, the, euler, approximations, the, most, notable, of, these, approximations, are, euler, s, method, and, the, euler, maclaurin, formula, euler, helped, develop, the, euler, bernoulli, beam, equation, which, became, a, cornerstone, of, engineering, besides, successfully, applying, his, analytic, tools, to, problems, in, classical, mechanics, euler, applied, these, techniques, to, celestial, problems, his, work, in, astronomy, was, recognized, by, multiple, paris, academy, prizes, over, the, course, of, his, career, his, accomplishments, include, determining, with, great, accuracy, the, orbits, of, comets, and, other, celestial, bodies, understanding, the, nature, of, comets, and, calculating, the, parallax, of, the, sun, his, calculations, contributed, to, the, development, of, accurate, longitude, tables, euler, made, important, contributions, in, optics, he, disagreed, with, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, of, light, which, was, the, prevailing, theory, of, the, time, his, 1740s, papers, on, optics, helped, ensure, that, the, wave, theory, of, light, proposed, by, christiaan, huygens, would, become, the, dominant, mode, of, thought, at, least, until, the, development, of, the, quantum, theory, of, light, in, fluid, dynamics, euler, was, the, first, to, predict, the, phenomenon, of, cavitation, in, 1754, long, before, its, first, observation, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, euler, number, used, in, fluid, flow, calculations, comes, from, his, related, work, on, the, efficiency, of, turbines, in, 1757, he, published, an, important, set, of, equations, for, inviscid, flow, in, fluid, dynamics, that, are, now, known, as, the, euler, equations, euler, is, well, known, in, structural, engineering, for, his, formula, giving, euler, s, critical, load, the, critical, buckling, load, of, an, ideal, strut, which, depends, only, on, its, length, and, flexural, stiffness, euler, is, credited, with, using, closed, curves, to, illustrate, syllogistic, reasoning, 1768, these, diagrams, have, become, known, as, euler, diagrams, an, euler, diagram, is, a, diagrammatic, means, of, representing, sets, and, their, relationships, euler, diagrams, consist, of, simple, closed, curves, usually, circles, in, the, plane, that, depict, sets, each, euler, curve, divides, the, plane, into, two, regions, or, zones, the, interior, which, symbolically, represents, the, elements, of, the, set, and, the, exterior, which, represents, all, elements, that, are, not, members, of, the, set, the, sizes, or, shapes, of, the, curves, are, not, important, the, significance, of, the, diagram, is, in, how, they, overlap, the, spatial, relationships, between, the, regions, bounded, by, each, curve, overlap, containment, or, neither, corresponds, to, set, theoretic, relationships, intersection, subset, and, disjointness, curves, whose, interior, zones, do, not, intersect, represent, disjoint, sets, two, curves, whose, interior, zones, intersect, represent, sets, that, have, common, elements, the, zone, inside, both, curves, represents, the, set, of, elements, common, to, both, sets, the, intersection, of, the, sets, a, curve, that, is, contained, completely, within, the, interior, zone, of, another, represents, a, subset, of, it, euler, diagrams, and, their, refinement, to, venn, diagrams, were, incorporated, as, part, of, instruction, in, set, theory, as, part, of, the, new, math, movement, in, the, 1960s, since, then, they, have, come, into, wide, use, as, a, way, of, visualizing, combinations, of, characteristics, one, of, euler, s, more, unusual, interests, was, the, application, of, mathematical, ideas, in, music, in, 1739, he, wrote, the, tentamen, novae, theoriae, musicae, attempt, at, a, new, theory, of, music, hoping, to, eventually, incorporate, musical, theory, as, part, of, mathematics, this, part, of, his, work, however, did, not, receive, wide, attention, and, was, once, described, as, too, mathematical, for, musicians, and, too, musical, for, mathematicians, even, when, dealing, with, music, euler, s, approach, is, mainly, mathematical, for, instance, his, introduction, of, binary, logarithms, as, a, way, of, numerically, describing, the, subdivision, of, octaves, into, fractional, parts, his, writings, on, music, are, not, particularly, numerous, a, few, hundred, pages, in, his, total, production, of, about, thirty, thousand, pages, but, they, reflect, an, early, preoccupation, and, one, that, remained, with, him, throughout, his, life, a, first, point, of, euler, s, musical, theory, is, the, definition, of, genres, i, e, of, possible, divisions, of, the, octave, using, the, prime, numbers, 3, and, 5, euler, describes, 18, such, genres, with, the, general, definition, 2, m, a, where, a, is, the, exponent, of, the, genre, i, e, the, sum, of, the, exponents, of, 3, and, 5, and, 2, m, where, m, is, an, indefinite, number, small, or, large, so, long, as, the, sounds, are, perceptible, expresses, that, the, relation, holds, independently, of, the, number, of, octaves, concerned, the, first, genre, with, a, 1, is, the, octave, itself, or, its, duplicates, the, second, genre, 2, m, 3, is, the, octave, divided, by, the, fifth, fifth, fourth, c, g, c, the, third, genre, is, 2, m, 5, major, third, minor, sixth, c, e, c, the, fourth, is, 2, m, 3, 2, two, fourths, and, a, tone, c, f, b, c, the, fifth, is, 2, m, 3, 5, c, e, g, b, c, etc, genres, 12, 2, m, 3, 3, 5, 13, 2, m, 3, 2, 5, 2, and, 14, 2, m, 3, 5, 3, are, corrected, versions, of, the, diatonic, chromatic, and, enharmonic, respectively, of, the, ancients, genre, 18, 2, m, 3, 3, 5, 2, is, the, diatonico, chromatic, used, generally, in, all, compositions, and, which, turns, out, to, be, identical, with, the, system, described, by, johann, mattheson, euler, later, envisaged, the, possibility, of, describing, genres, including, the, prime, number, 7, euler, devised, a, specific, graph, the, speculum, musicum, to, illustrate, the, diatonico, chromatic, genre, and, discussed, paths, in, this, graph, for, specific, intervals, recalling, his, interest, in, the, seven, bridges, of, k, nigsberg, see, above, the, device, drew, renewed, interest, as, the, tonnetz, in, neo, riemannian, theory, see, also, lattice, music, euler, further, used, the, principle, of, the, exponent, to, propose, a, derivation, of, the, gradus, suavitatis, degree, of, suavity, of, agreeableness, of, intervals, and, chords, from, their, prime, factors, one, must, keep, in, mind, that, he, considered, just, intonation, i, e, 1, and, the, prime, numbers, 3, and, 5, only, formulas, have, been, proposed, extending, this, system, to, any, number, of, prime, numbers, e, g, in, the, form, d, s, i, k, i, p, i, k, i, 1, displaystyle, ds, sum, i, k, i, p, i, k, i, 1, where, p, i, are, prime, numbers, and, k, i, their, exponents, euler, was, a, religious, person, throughout, his, life, much, of, what, is, known, of, euler, s, religious, beliefs, can, be, deduced, from, his, letters, to, a, german, princess, and, an, earlier, work, rettung, der, g, ttlichen, offenbahrung, gegen, die, einw, rfe, der, freygeister, defense, of, the, divine, revelation, against, the, objections, of, the, freethinkers, these, works, show, that, euler, was, a, devout, christian, who, believed, the, bible, to, be, inspired, the, rettung, was, primarily, an, argument, for, the, divine, inspiration, of, scripture, euler, opposed, the, concepts, of, leibniz, s, monadism, and, the, philosophy, of, christian, wolff, euler, insisted, that, knowledge, is, founded, in, part, on, the, basis, of, precise, quantitative, laws, something, that, monadism, and, wolffian, science, were, unable, to, provide, euler, also, labelled, wolff, s, ideas, as, heathen, and, atheistic, there, is, a, famous, legend, inspired, by, euler, s, arguments, with, secular, philosophers, over, religion, which, is, set, during, euler, s, second, stint, at, the, st, petersburg, academy, the, french, philosopher, denis, diderot, was, visiting, russia, on, catherine, the, great, s, invitation, however, the, empress, was, alarmed, that, the, philosopher, s, arguments, for, atheism, were, influencing, members, of, her, court, and, so, euler, was, asked, to, confront, the, frenchman, diderot, was, informed, that, a, learned, mathematician, had, produced, a, proof, of, the, existence, of, god, he, agreed, to, view, the, proof, as, it, was, presented, in, court, euler, appeared, advanced, toward, diderot, and, in, a, tone, of, perfect, conviction, announced, this, non, sequitur, sir, a, b, n, n, x, displaystyle, frac, a, b, n, n, x, hence, god, exists, reply, diderot, to, whom, says, the, story, all, mathematics, was, gibberish, stood, dumbstruck, as, peals, of, laughter, erupted, from, the, court, embarrassed, he, asked, to, leave, russia, a, request, that, was, graciously, granted, by, the, empress, however, amusing, the, anecdote, may, be, it, is, apocryphal, given, that, diderot, himself, did, research, in, mathematics, the, legend, was, apparently, first, told, by, dieudonn, thi, bault, with, embellishment, by, augustus, de, morgan, euler, was, featured, on, both, the, sixth, and, seventh, series, of, the, swiss, 10, franc, banknote, and, on, numerous, swiss, german, and, russian, postage, stamps, in, 1782, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, the, asteroid, 2002, euler, was, named, in, his, honour, euler, has, an, extensive, bibliography, his, books, include, it, took, until, 1830, for, the, bulk, of, euler, s, posthumous, works, to, be, individually, published, with, an, additional, batch, of, 61, unpublished, works, discovered, by, paul, heinrich, von, fuss, euler, s, great, grandson, and, nicolas, fuss, s, son, and, published, as, a, collection, in, 1862, a, chronological, catalog, of, euler, s, works, was, compiled, by, swedish, mathematician, gustaf, enestr, m, and, published, from, 1910, to, 1913, the, catalog, known, as, the, enestr, m, index, numbers, euler, s, works, from, e1, to, e866, the, euler, archive, was, started, at, dartmouth, college, before, moving, to, the, mathematical, association, of, america, and, most, recently, to, university, of, the, pacific, in, 2017, in, 1907, the, swiss, academy, of, sciences, created, the, euler, commission, and, charged, it, with, the, publication, of, euler, s, complete, works, after, several, delays, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, volume, of, the, opera, omnia, was, published, in, 1911, however, the, discovery, of, new, manuscripts, continued, to, increase, the, magnitude, of, this, project, fortunately, the, publication, of, euler, s, opera, omnia, has, made, steady, progress, with, over, 70, volumes, averaging, 426, pages, each, published, by, 2006, and, 80, volumes, published, by, 2022, these, volumes, are, organized, into, four, series, the, first, series, compiles, the, works, on, analysis, algebra, and, number, theory, it, consists, of, 29, volumes, and, numbers, over, 14, 000, pages, the, 31, volumes, of, series, ii, amounting, to, 10, 660, pages, contain, the, works, on, mechanics, astronomy, and, engineering, series, iii, contains, 12, volumes, on, physics, series, iv, which, contains, the, massive, amount, of, euler, s, correspondences, unpublished, manuscripts, and, notes, only, began, compilation, in, 1967, after, publishing, 8, print, volumes, in, series, iv, the, project, decided, in, 2022, to, publish, its, remaining, projected, volumes, in, series, iv, in, online, format, only
