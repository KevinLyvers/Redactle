george, westinghouse, jr, october, 6, 1846, march, 12, 1914, was, an, american, entrepreneur, and, engineer, based, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, who, is, best, known, for, his, creation, of, the, railway, air, brake, and, was, a, pioneer, of, the, electrical, industry, he, founded, the, westinghouse, air, brake, company, in, 1869, westinghouse, saw, the, potential, of, using, alternating, current, for, electric, power, distribution, in, the, early, 1880s, he, founded, the, westinghouse, electric, corporation, in, 1886, westinghouse, s, business, was, in, direct, competition, with, thomas, edison, who, marketed, direct, current, for, electric, power, distribution, the, westinghouse, company, successfully, marketed, its, ac, system, at, the, 1893, columbian, exposition, in, chicago, and, went, on, to, install, the, first, large, scale, commercial, ac, power, generation, plant, at, niagara, falls, by, august, 1895, in, 1911, westinghouse, received, the, american, institute, of, electrical, engineers, s, aiee, edison, medal, for, meritorious, achievement, in, connection, with, the, development, of, the, alternating, current, system, george, westinghouse, was, born, in, 1846, in, central, bridge, new, york, see, george, westinghouse, jr, birthplace, and, boyhood, home, the, son, of, emeline, vedder, and, george, westinghouse, sr, a, machine, shop, owner, his, ancestors, came, from, westphalia, in, germany, who, first, moved, to, england, and, then, emigrated, to, the, us, the, name, had, been, anglicized, from, westinghausen, from, his, youth, westinghouse, was, talented, with, machinery, and, business, at, the, breakout, of, the, civil, war, in, 1862, the, 15, year, old, westinghouse, enlisted, in, the, new, york, national, guard, and, served, until, his, parents, urged, him, to, return, home, the, following, year, he, persuaded, his, parents, to, allow, him, to, re, enlist, whereupon, he, joined, company, m, of, the, 16th, new, york, cavalry, and, earned, promotion, to, the, rank, of, corporal, in, december, 1864, he, resigned, from, the, army, to, join, the, navy, serving, as, acting, third, assistant, engineer, on, the, gunboat, uss, muscoota, through, the, end, of, the, war, after, his, military, discharge, in, august, 1865, he, returned, to, his, family, in, schenectady, and, enrolled, at, union, college, he, lost, interest, in, the, curriculum, and, dropped, out, in, his, first, term, westinghouse, was, 19, years, old, when, he, created, his, first, invention, a, rotary, steam, engine, he, also, devised, the, westinghouse, farm, engine, at, age, 21, he, invented, a, car, replacer, a, device, to, guide, derailed, railroad, cars, back, onto, the, tracks, and, a, reversible, frog, a, device, used, with, a, railroad, switch, to, guide, trains, onto, one, of, two, tracks, in, 1868, he, established, residence, with, his, wife, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, to, gain, access, to, less, expensive, steel, for, his, railroad, frogs, and, where, he, developed, his, recently, invented, railroad, air, brake, concept, he, had, witnessed, a, train, collision, where, two, engineers, saw, one, another, but, were, unable, to, stop, their, trains, in, time, using, the, existing, brake, system, brakemen, had, to, run, from, car, to, car, on, catwalks, atop, the, cars, applying, the, brakes, manually, on, each, car, in, 1869, at, age, 22, westinghouse, first, publicly, demonstrated, his, new, railroad, braking, system, using, compressed, air, the, westinghouse, system, used, an, air, compressor, on, the, locomotive, an, air, reservoir, and, a, special, valve, on, each, car, and, a, single, compressed, air, pipe, running, the, length, of, the, train, with, flexible, connections, which, both, refilled, the, reservoirs, and, controlled, the, brakes, allowing, the, engineer, to, apply, and, release, the, brakes, simultaneously, on, all, cars, it, was, a, failsafe, system, in, that, any, rupture, or, disconnection, in, the, air, pipe, applied, the, brakes, throughout, the, train, as, luck, would, have, it, the, demonstration, did, in, fact, prevent, a, potentially, serious, mishap, in, front, of, the, assembled, witnesses, the, westinghouse, air, brake, company, was, founded, in, the, u, s, in, 1869, westinghouse, pursued, many, improvements, in, railway, signals, which, had, previously, used, oil, lamps, in, 1881, he, founded, the, union, switch, and, signal, company, to, manufacture, his, signaling, and, switching, inventions, westinghouse, s, interests, in, gas, distribution, and, telephone, switching, led, him, to, become, interested, in, the, then, new, field, of, electrical, power, distribution, in, the, early, 1880s, electric, lighting, was, a, growing, business, with, many, companies, building, outdoor, direct, current, dc, and, alternating, current, ac, arc, lighting, based, street, lighting, systems, at, the, same, time, thomas, edison, was, launching, the, first, dc, electric, utility, designed, to, light, homes, and, businesses, with, his, patented, incandescent, bulb, in, 1884, westinghouse, started, developing, his, own, dc, domestic, lighting, system, and, hired, physicist, william, stanley, to, work, on, it, westinghouse, became, aware, of, the, new, european, alternating, current, systems, in, 1885, when, he, read, about, them, in, the, uk, technical, journal, engineering, ac, had, the, ability, to, be, stepped, up, in, voltage, by, a, transformer, for, distribution, and, then, stepped, down, by, a, transformer, for, consumer, use, allowing, large, centralized, power, plants, to, supply, electricity, long, distance, in, cities, with, more, dispersed, populations, this, was, an, advantage, over, the, low, voltage, dc, systems, being, marketed, by, thomas, edison, s, electric, utility, which, had, a, limited, range, due, to, the, low, voltages, used, westinghouse, saw, ac, s, potential, to, achieve, greater, economies, of, scale, as, way, to, build, a, truly, competitive, system, instead, of, simply, building, another, barely, competitive, dc, lighting, system, using, patents, just, different, enough, to, get, around, the, edison, patents, in, 1885, westinghouse, imported, several, gaulard, gibbs, transformers, and, a, siemens, ac, generator, to, begin, experimenting, with, ac, networks, in, pittsburgh, stanley, assisted, by, engineers, albert, schmid, and, oliver, b, shallenberger, developed, the, gaulard, gibbs, transformer, design, into, the, first, practical, transformer, in, 1886, with, westinghouse, s, backing, stanley, installed, the, first, multiple, voltage, ac, power, system, in, great, barrington, massachusetts, a, demonstration, lighting, system, driven, by, a, hydroelectric, generator, that, produced, 500, volts, ac, stepped, down, to, 100, volts, to, light, incandescent, bulbs, in, homes, and, businesses, that, same, year, westinghouse, formed, the, westinghouse, electric, manufacturing, company, in, 1889, he, renamed, it, as, westinghouse, electric, corporation, the, westinghouse, company, installed, 30, more, ac, lighting, systems, within, a, year, and, by, the, end, of, 1887, it, had, 68, alternating, current, power, stations, to, edison, s, 121, dc, based, stations, this, competition, with, edison, led, in, the, late, 1880s, to, what, has, been, called, the, war, of, currents, with, thomas, edison, and, his, company, joining, in, with, a, spreading, public, perception, that, the, high, voltages, used, in, ac, distribution, were, unsafe, edison, even, suggested, a, westinghouse, ac, generator, be, used, in, the, state, of, new, york, s, new, electric, chair, westinghouse, also, had, to, deal, with, an, ac, rival, the, thomson, houston, electric, company, which, had, built, 22, power, stations, by, the, end, of, 1887, and, by, 1889, had, bought, out, another, competitor, the, brush, electric, company, thomson, houston, was, expanding, its, business, while, trying, to, avoid, patent, conflicts, with, westinghouse, arranging, deals, such, as, coming, to, agreements, over, lighting, company, territory, paying, a, royalty, to, use, the, stanley, transformer, patent, and, allowing, westinghouse, to, use, their, sawyer, man, incandescent, bulb, patent, the, edison, company, in, collusion, with, thomson, houston, managed, to, arrange, in, 1890, that, the, first, electric, chair, was, powered, with, a, westinghouse, ac, generator, forcing, westinghouse, to, try, to, block, this, move, by, hiring, the, best, lawyer, of, the, day, to, unsuccessfully, defend, william, kemmler, the, first, man, scheduled, to, die, in, the, chair, the, war, of, currents, ended, with, financiers, such, as, j, p, morgan, pushing, edison, electric, towards, ac, and, pushing, out, thomas, edison, in, 1892, the, edison, company, was, merged, with, the, thomson, houston, electric, company, to, form, general, electric, a, conglomerate, with, the, board, of, thomson, houston, in, control, during, this, period, westinghouse, continued, to, pour, funds, and, engineering, resources, into, the, goal, of, building, a, completely, integrated, ac, system, obtaining, the, sawyer, man, lamp, by, buying, consolidated, electric, light, developing, components, such, as, an, induction, meter, and, obtaining, the, rights, to, inventor, nikola, tesla, s, brushless, ac, induction, motor, along, with, patents, for, a, new, type, of, electric, power, distribution, polyphase, alternating, current, the, acquisition, of, a, feasible, ac, motor, gave, westinghouse, a, key, patent, for, his, system, but, the, financial, strain, of, buying, up, patents, and, hiring, the, engineers, needed, to, build, it, meant, development, of, tesla, s, motor, had, to, be, put, on, hold, for, a, while, in, 1890, westinghouse, s, company, was, in, trouble, the, near, collapse, of, barings, bank, in, london, triggered, the, financial, panic, of, 1890, causing, investors, to, call, in, their, loans, the, sudden, cash, shortage, forced, the, company, to, refinance, its, debts, the, new, lenders, demanded, that, westinghouse, cut, back, on, what, looked, like, excessive, spending, on, acquisition, of, other, companies, research, and, patents, in, 1891, westinghouse, built, a, hydroelectric, ac, power, plant, the, ames, hydroelectric, generating, plant, near, ophir, colorado, the, plant, supplied, power, to, the, gold, king, mine, 3, 5, miles, away, this, was, the, first, successful, demonstration, of, long, distance, transmission, of, industrial, grade, alternating, current, power, and, used, two, 100, hp, westinghouse, alternators, one, working, as, a, generator, producing, 3000, volt, 133, hertz, single, phase, ac, and, the, other, used, as, an, ac, motor, at, the, beginning, of, 1893, westinghouse, engineer, benjamin, lamme, had, made, great, progress, developing, an, efficient, version, of, tesla, s, induction, motor, and, westinghouse, electric, started, branding, their, complete, polyphase, ac, system, as, the, tesla, polyphase, system, announcing, tesla, s, patents, gave, them, patent, priority, over, other, ac, systems, and, their, intentions, to, sue, patent, infringers, in, 1893, george, westinghouse, won, the, bid, to, light, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, in, chicago, with, alternating, current, slightly, underbidding, general, electric, to, get, the, contract, this, world, s, fair, devoted, a, building, to, electrical, exhibits, it, was, a, key, event, in, the, history, of, ac, power, as, westinghouse, demonstrated, the, safety, reliability, and, efficiency, of, a, fully, integrated, alternating, current, system, to, the, american, public, westinghouse, s, demonstration, that, they, could, build, a, complete, ac, system, at, the, columbian, exposition, was, instrumental, in, them, getting, the, contract, for, building, a, two, phase, ac, generating, system, the, adams, power, plant, at, niagara, falls, in, 1895, at, the, same, time, a, contract, to, build, the, three, phase, ac, distribution, system, the, project, needed, was, awarded, to, general, electric, the, early, to, mid, 1890s, saw, general, electric, backed, by, financier, j, p, morgan, involved, in, costly, takeover, attempts, and, patent, battles, with, westinghouse, electric, the, competition, was, so, costly, a, patent, sharing, agreement, was, signed, between, the, two, companies, in, 1896, by, 1883, westinghouse, had, become, interested, in, drilling, for, and, distributing, natural, gas, gas, had, been, found, a, few, years, earlier, in, nearby, murrysville, pennsylvania, he, decided, to, drill, for, gas, on, his, estate, solitude, today, s, westinghouse, park, in, pittsburgh, when, the, drilling, struck, gas, on, the, night, of, may, 21, 1884, it, caused, a, local, sensation, and, encouraged, him, to, further, develop, a, natural, gas, distribution, system, to, deliver, gas, to, homes, and, businesses, for, heating, and, lighting, he, obtained, over, 30, patents, for, this, technology, and, founded, the, philadelphia, company, to, market, and, promote, the, use, of, natural, gas, in, 1886, the, company, had, 58, wells, and, 184, miles, of, distribution, piping, in, pittsburgh, and, by, 1887, it, served, over, 12, 000, private, homes, and, 582, industrial, customers, growth, of, the, business, was, limited, in, the, 1890s, by, natural, gas, supply, problems, and, ongoing, concerns, about, the, safety, of, gas, distribution, systems, in, homes, and, businesses, westinghouse, resigned, as, president, of, the, philadelphia, company, in, 1889, as, his, involvement, with, the, generation, and, distribution, of, electricity, were, increasing, westinghouse, was, interested, in, electrical, power, production, at, the, outset, the, available, generating, sources, were, hydroturbines, where, falling, water, was, available, and, reciprocating, steam, engines, where, it, was, not, westinghouse, felt, that, reciprocating, steam, engines, were, clumsy, and, inefficient, and, wanted, to, develop, some, class, of, rotating, engine, that, would, be, more, elegant, and, efficient, one, of, his, first, inventions, had, been, a, rotary, steam, engine, but, it, had, proven, impractical, the, british, engineer, charles, algernon, parsons, began, experimenting, with, steam, turbines, in, 1884, beginning, with, a, 10, horsepower, 7, 5, kw, turbine, westinghouse, bought, rights, to, the, parsons, turbine, in, 1885, improved, the, parsons, technology, and, increased, its, scale, in, 1898, westinghouse, demonstrated, a, 300, kilowatt, unit, replacing, reciprocating, engines, in, his, air, brake, factory, the, next, year, he, installed, a, 1, 5, megawatt, 1, 200, rpm, unit, for, the, hartford, electric, light, company, westinghouse, then, developed, steam, turbines, for, maritime, propulsion, large, turbines, were, most, efficient, at, about, 3, 000, rpm, while, an, efficient, propeller, operated, at, about, 100, rpm, that, required, reduction, gearing, but, building, reduction, gearing, that, could, operate, at, high, rpm, and, at, high, power, was, difficult, since, a, slight, misalignment, would, shake, the, power, train, to, pieces, westinghouse, and, his, engineers, devised, an, automatic, alignment, system, that, made, turbine, power, practical, for, large, vessels, in, 1889, westinghouse, purchased, several, mining, claims, in, the, patagonia, mountains, of, southeastern, arizona, and, formed, the, duquesne, mining, reduction, company, a, year, later, he, founded, duquesne, to, use, as, his, company, headquarters, it, is, now, a, ghost, town, he, lived, in, a, large, victorian, frame, house, which, still, stands, but, in, disrepair, duquesne, grew, to, over, 1, 000, residents, and, the, mine, reached, its, peak, production, in, the, mid, 1910s, with, the, introduction, of, the, automobile, after, the, turn, of, the, century, westinghouse, went, back, to, earlier, inventions, and, devised, a, compressed, air, shock, absorber, for, automobile, suspensions, at, one, time, westinghouse, began, to, work, on, heat, pumps, that, could, provide, heating, and, cooling, westinghouse, was, after, a, perpetual, motion, machine, and, the, british, physicist, lord, kelvin, one, of, westinghouse, s, correspondents, told, him, that, he, would, be, violating, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, westinghouse, replied, that, might, be, the, case, but, it, made, no, difference, if, he, couldn, t, build, a, perpetual, motion, machine, he, would, still, have, a, heat, pump, system, that, he, could, patent, and, sell, westinghouse, was, the, first, industrial, employer, to, give, his, workers, a, five, and, a, half, day, work, week, starting, 1881, saturdays, were, made, half, free, days, to, promote, community, involvement, and, personal, development, the, planned, community, of, wilmerding, pa, was, home, to, many, employees, and, was, also, the, headquarters, of, several, of, the, westinghouse, companies, particularly, the, westinghouse, air, brake, company, his, engineers, who, obtained, patents, for, inventions, were, allowed, to, keep, their, own, names, on, the, patents, rather, than, put, them, in, the, name, of, the, company, american, labor, and, union, organizer, samuel, gompers, is, reputed, to, have, said, if, all, business, leaders, and, moguls, treated, their, employees, as, well, as, george, westinghouse, there, d, be, no, need, for, any, labor, unions, in, 1867, westinghouse, met, and, soon, married, marguerite, erskine, walker, they, were, married, for, 47, years, and, had, one, son, george, westinghouse, iii, who, in, turn, had, six, children, westinghouse, remained, a, captain, of, american, industry, until, 1907, when, the, financial, panic, of, 1907, led, to, his, resignation, from, control, of, the, westinghouse, company, by, 1911, he, was, no, longer, active, in, business, and, his, health, was, in, decline, george, and, marguerite, westinghouse, maintained, a, large, home, in, pittsburgh, called, solitude, building, up, from, an, existing, house, and, land, purchased, by, george, in, 1871, they, were, part, of, a, social, class, of, very, rich, local, industrialists, including, neighbors, henry, clay, frick, henry, j, heinz, and, andrew, carnegie, their, guests, included, nicola, tesla, lord, kelvin, and, congressman, william, mckinley, by, 1893, they, had, constructed, erskine, park, in, lenox, massachusetts, which, they, used, as, a, summer, home, in, part, as, a, respite, from, the, gritty, industrial, environment, of, pittsburgh, it, was, named, for, the, family, of, marguerite, s, grandparents, in, 1989, they, leased, and, then, in, 1901, purchased, the, blaine, house, mansion, in, washington, d, c, marguerite, westinghouse, was, reputed, to, host, frequent, and, lavish, entertainments, there, in, 1918, his, former, pittsburgh, home, solitude, was, razed, and, the, land, given, to, the, city, of, pittsburgh, to, establish, westinghouse, park, the, house, in, erskine, park, was, sold, by, the, family, in, 1917, and, subsequently, demolished, george, westinghouse, died, on, march, 12, 1914, in, new, york, city, at, age, 67, he, was, initially, interred, in, woodlawn, cemetery, bronx, ny, then, removed, on, december, 14, 1915, as, a, civil, war, veteran, he, was, buried, in, arlington, national, cemetery, along, with, his, wife, marguerite, who, survived, him, by, three, months, she, had, also, been, initially, interred, in, woodlawn, and, removed, and, reinterred, at, the, same, time, as, george, george, westinghouse, was, appreciated, by, his, colleagues, for, example, nicola, tesla, with, whom, he, developed, the, ac, polyphase, system, of, electric, power, distribution, spoke, of, him, in, 1938, as, follows, george, westinghouse, was, in, my, opinion, the, only, man, on, this, globe, who, could, take, my, alternating, current, system, under, the, circumstances, then, existing, and, win, the, battle, against, prejudice, and, money, power, he, was, a, pioneer, of, imposing, stature, one, of, the, world, s, true, noblemen, of, whom, america, may, well, be, proud, and, to, whom, humanity, owes, an, immense, debt, of, gratitude, in, 1930, the, westinghouse, memorial, funded, by, his, employees, was, placed, in, schenley, park, in, pittsburgh, also, named, in, his, honor, george, westinghouse, bridge, is, near, the, site, of, his, turtle, creek, plant, its, plaque, reads, the, george, westinghouse, jr, birthplace, and, boyhood, home, in, central, bridge, new, york, was, listed, on, the, national, register, of, historic, places, in, 1986, in, 1989, westinghouse, was, inducted, into, the, national, inventors, hall, of, fame, in, pittsburgh, westinghouse, high, school, located, not, far, from, his, former, residence, was, named, in, his, honor, in, 1915
