interned, disappointed, with, relations, between, the, italians, and, the, usta, e, organization, paveli, became, closer, to, nazi, germany, who, promised, to, change, the, map, of, europe, fixed, under, the, 1919, treaty, of, versailles, in, october, 1936, he, finished, a, survey, for, the, german, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, called, the, croatian, question, croatian, hrvatsko, pitanje, german, die, kroatische, frage, according, to, ivo, goldstein, the, survey, deemed, the, serbian, state, authorities, international, freemasonry, jews, and, communism, as, enemies, and, stated, that, today, almost, all, banking, and, almost, all, trade, in, croatia, is, in, the, hands, of, the, jews, this, became, possible, only, because, the, state, gave, them, privileges, because, the, government, believed, that, this, would, weaken, croatian, national, strength, the, jews, greeted, the, foundation, of, the, so, called, yugoslav, state, with, great, enthusiasm, because, a, national, croatian, state, would, never, suit, them, as, well, as, yugoslavia, did, all, the, press, in, croatia, is, in, jewish, hands, this, jewish, freemason, press, is, constantly, attacking, germany, the, german, people, and, national, socialism, according, to, matkovi, after, 1937, paveli, paid, more, attention, to, the, usta, e, in, yugoslavia, than, elsewhere, since, the, emigrants, had, become, passive, after, the, assassination, in, 1938, he, instructed, the, usta, e, to, form, stations, in, yugoslav, towns, the, fall, of, stojadinovi, s, government, and, the, creation, of, the, banovina, of, croatia, in, 1939, further, increased, usta, e, activity, they, founded, uzdanica, hope, a, savings, co, operative, under, uzdanica, usta, e, founded, usta, e, university, headquarters, and, the, illegal, association, matija, gubec, however, pavlowitch, observes, that, paveli, had, few, contacts, with, the, usta, e, within, yugoslavia, and, that, his, esteemed, position, within, the, usta, e, was, partly, due, to, his, isolation, in, italy, despite, their, rise, in, activity, in, the, 1930s, the, movement, experienced, only, moderate, growth, of, popularity, and, remained, a, marginal, group, in, the, late, 1930s, about, half, of, the, 500, usta, a, in, italy, were, voluntarily, repatriated, to, yugoslavia, went, underground, and, increased, their, activities, during, the, intensification, of, ties, with, nazi, germany, in, the, 1930s, paveli, s, concept, of, the, croatian, nation, became, increasingly, race, oriented, on, 1, april, 1937, after, the, stojadinovi, ciano, agreement, all, usta, e, units, were, dissolved, by, the, italian, government, after, that, paveli, was, put, under, house, arrest, in, siena, where, he, lived, until, 1939, during, this, period, he, penned, his, anti, bolshevik, work, horrors, and, mistakes, italian, errori, e, orrori, croatian, strahote, zabluda, which, was, published, in, 1938, it, was, immediately, seized, by, the, authorities, at, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, he, moved, to, a, villa, near, florence, under, police, watch, until, spring, 1941, after, italy, occupied, albania, and, prepared, an, attack, on, yugoslavia, ciano, invited, paveli, to, negotiations, they, discussed, croatian, armed, revolt, italian, military, intervention, and, the, creation, of, a, croatian, state, with, monetary, customs, and, personal, unions, with, italy, which, paveli, later, refused, in, 1940, paveli, negotiated, with, the, italians, for, military, assistance, in, creating, a, separate, croatian, state, which, would, have, had, strong, ties, to, italy, but, this, plan, was, postponed, by, the, invasion, of, france, and, subsequently, derailed, by, adolf, hitler, on, 25, march, 1941, yugoslavia, signed, the, tripartite, pact, but, two, days, later, the, government, was, overthrown, in, a, bloodless, military, coup, by, opponents, who, were, motivated, by, a, range, of, factors, two, days, after, the, belgrade, coup, mussolini, invited, paveli, from, florence, to, his, private, residence, in, rome, the, villa, torlonia, this, was, their, first, meeting, since, paveli, s, arrival, in, italy, paveli, was, escorted, by, matija, bzik, but, mussolini, received, only, paveli, acting, foreign, minister, filippo, anfuso, was, present, during, the, meeting, paveli, and, mussolini, discussed, croatia, s, position, after, yugoslav, capitulation, mussolini, was, concerned, that, italian, designs, on, dalmatia, be, achieved, and, in, response, paveli, acknowledged, the, agreements, he, had, made, earlier, and, reassured, him, paveli, requested, the, release, of, the, remaining, interned, usta, e, an, italian, liaison, officer, was, allocated, to, him, and, the, italians, also, lent, him, a, radio, station, in, florence, so, he, could, conduct, late, evening, broadcasts, on, 1, april, 1941, paveli, called, for, the, liberation, of, croatia, on, 6, april, 1941, the, axis, invaded, yugoslavia, from, multiple, directions, rapidly, overwhelming, the, under, prepared, royal, yugoslav, army, which, capitulated, 11, days, later, the, german, operational, plan, included, making, political, promises, to, the, croats, to, increase, internal, discord, the, germans, generally, preferred, to, collaborate, with, non, fascists, who, were, willing, to, work, with, them, and, only, placed, out, and, out, fascists, in, charge, as, a, last, resort, croatia, was, no, exception, the, nazis, wanted, any, croatian, puppet, government, to, have, popular, support, so, that, they, could, control, their, zone, of, occupation, with, minimal, forces, and, exploit, the, available, resources, peacefully, the, administration, of, banovina, croatia, had, been, under, the, control, of, an, alliance, of, vladko, ma, ek, s, hss, and, the, mostly, croatian, serb, independent, democratic, party, ma, ek, was, very, popular, among, croats, had, been, vice, premier, in, the, yugoslav, cvetkovi, government, was, a, supporter, of, yugoslav, accession, to, the, axis, and, had, a, ready, made, para, military, force, in, the, form, of, the, hss, croatian, peasant, defence, as, a, result, the, germans, attempted, to, get, ma, ek, to, proclaim, an, independent, croatian, state, and, form, a, government, when, he, refused, to, cooperate, the, germans, decided, they, had, no, alternative, other, than, to, support, paveli, even, though, they, considered, that, the, usta, e, could, not, provide, an, assurance, they, could, govern, in, the, way, the, germans, wanted, it, was, estimated, by, the, germans, that, paveli, had, around, 900, sworn, usta, e, in, yugoslavia, at, the, time, of, the, invasion, and, the, usta, e, themselves, considered, that, their, supporters, only, numbered, some, 40, 000, the, germans, also, considered, paveli, to, be, an, italian, agent, or, mussolini, s, man, but, considered, that, other, senior, usta, as, such, as, deputy, leader, croatian, doglavnik, slavko, kvaternik, were, sufficiently, pro, german, to, ensure, their, interests, would, be, supported, by, any, regime, led, by, paveli, on, 10, april, 1941, kvaternik, declared, an, independent, state, of, croatia, in, the, name, of, the, poglavnik, ante, paveli, via, the, zagreb, radio, station, kvaternik, was, acting, on, the, orders, of, ss, brigadef, hrer, brigadier, edmund, veesenmayer, the, proclamation, was, viewed, favourably, by, a, significant, portion, of, the, population, particularly, those, living, in, zagreb, western, herzegovina, and, lika, the, croatian, peasant, defence, which, had, been, infiltrated, by, the, usta, e, assisted, by, disarming, royal, yugoslav, army, units, and, imposing, some, control, however, the, ustashe, received, limited, support, from, ordinary, croats, the, commander, of, german, forces, in, the, ndh, estimated, that, only, around, 2, of, the, country, s, population, supported, the, ustashe, regime, the, usta, e, that, had, been, interned, in, italy, had, been, concentrated, at, pistoia, about, 50, km, from, florence, where, they, were, issued, with, italian, uniforms, and, small, arms, they, were, joined, by, paveli, on, 10, april, and, listened, to, radio, broadcasts, announcing, the, proclamation, of, the, ndh, paveli, s, visit, to, pistoia, was, actually, his, first, meeting, with, the, usta, e, after, the, assassination, in, marseilles, in, pistoia, paveli, gave, a, speech, in, which, he, announced, that, their, struggle, for, an, independent, croatia, was, near, the, end, after, that, he, returned, to, his, home, in, florence, where, he, heard, kvaternik, s, proclamation, on, a, radio, broadcast, from, vienna, on, 11, april, paveli, went, to, rome, where, he, was, hosted, by, anfuso, after, which, he, was, received, by, mussolini, during, the, meeting, paveli, was, guaranteed, that, his, government, would, be, recognized, immediately, after, he, arrived, in, zagreb, after, a, meeting, in, rome, paveli, boarded, the, train, with, his, usta, e, escort, and, went, to, zagreb, via, trieste, and, rijeka, he, arrived, at, karlovac, on, 13, april, with, about, 250, 400, usta, e, where, was, greeted, by, veesenmayer, who, was, appointed, by, german, foreign, minister, joachim, von, ribbentrop, to, supervise, the, state, s, creation, in, karlovac, paveli, was, asked, to, confirm, that, he, had, not, made, any, commitments, to, the, italians, but, mussolini, s, envoy, arrived, while, he, was, there, and, negotiations, ensued, to, ensure, that, his, messages, to, hitler, and, mussolini, would, deal, satisfactorily, with, the, questions, of, dalmatia, and, recognition, by, the, axis, powers, this, issue, was, the, first, sign, of, italo, german, tensions, over, the, ndh, diplomatic, recognition, of, the, ndh, by, the, axis, was, delayed, to, ensure, that, paveli, made, the, promised, territorial, concessions, to, italy, these, concessions, meant, that, paveli, handed, to, italy, some, 5, 400, square, kilometres, of, territory, with, a, population, of, 380, 000, consisting, of, about, 280, 000, croats, 90, 000, serbs, 5, 000, italians, and, 5, 000, others, once, this, was, completed, paveli, travelled, to, zagreb, on, 15, april, and, axis, recognition, was, also, granted, to, the, ndh, on, that, day, on, 16, april, 1941, paveli, signed, a, decree, appointing, the, new, croatian, state, government, he, was, the, first, to, take, an, oath, after, which, he, stated, since, 1102, croatian, people, autonomous, and, independent, state, and, there, after, 839, years, the, time, has, come, to, form, responsible, croatian, government, paveli, thus, presented, the, ndh, as, the, embodiment, of, the, historical, aspirations, of, the, croatian, people, the, decree, named, osman, kulenovi, as, the, vice, president, of, the, government, and, slavko, kvaternik, as, paveli, s, deputy, and, appointed, eight, other, senior, usta, e, as, ministers, the, usta, e, made, use, of, the, existing, bureaucracy, of, the, banovina, of, croatia, after, it, had, been, purged, and, usta, ised, the, new, regime, drew, upon, the, concept, of, an, uninterrupted, croatian, state, since, the, arrival, of, the, croats, in, their, contemporary, homeland, and, reflected, extreme, croat, nationalism, mixed, with, nazism, and, italian, fascism, catholic, clerical, authoritarianism, and, the, peasantism, of, the, croatian, peasant, party, when, the, anti, serb, atrocities, were, under, way, paveli, remained, a, devoted, catholic, he, participated, in, mass, in, his, chapel, worshipped, and, confessed, his, sins, paveli, tried, to, prolong, the, negotiations, with, italy, about, the, boundary, between, the, two, states, at, the, time, he, was, receiving, support, from, berlin, ciano, insisted, that, italy, must, annex, the, whole, croatian, littoral, and, after, some, time, the, germans, pulled, back, to, protect, german, italian, relations, on, 25, april, paveli, and, ciano, met, in, ljubljana, again, discussing, borders, ciano, s, first, proposal, was, italian, annexation, of, the, whole, croatian, littoral, and, hinterland, all, the, way, to, karlovac, another, proposal, was, somewhat, less, demanding, but, with, closer, ties, with, italy, including, a, monetary, customs, and, personal, union, paveli, refused, and, instead, demanded, that, croatian, gain, the, towns, of, trogir, split, and, dubrovnik, ciano, did, not, respond, but, promised, another, meeting, paveli, was, still, counting, on, german, support, but, without, success, on, 7, may, 1941, paveli, and, mussolini, met, in, tr, i, and, agreed, to, discuss, the, matter, in, rome, on, 18, may, 1941, paveli, went, to, rome, with, his, delegation, and, signed, a, treaty, of, rome, in, which, croatia, gave, up, part, of, dalmatia, krk, rab, kor, ula, biograd, ibenik, trogir, split, iovo, veliki, i, mali, drvenik, olta, mljet, and, parts, of, konavle, and, the, bay, of, kotor, to, italy, a, croatian, proposal, that, split, and, kor, ula, island, be, jointly, administered, was, ignored, these, annexations, shocked, the, people, and, led, to, the, only, public, demonstration, recorded, in, the, independent, state, of, croatia, s, history, hundreds, of, citizens, members, of, the, usta, e, movement, and, the, domobranstvo, army, protested, on, 25, december, 1941, paveli, tried, to, retrieve, the, lost, areas, but, kept, his, real, feelings, and, those, of, the, people, from, the, italians, to, maintain, the, pretext, of, good, relations, paveli, agreed, to, name, prince, aimone, duke, of, spoleto, as, king, of, croatia, to, avoid, a, union, with, the, kingdom, of, italy, but, delayed, the, formalities, in, the, hope, of, gaining, more, territory, in, return, for, accepting, the, new, king, aimone, was, officially, declared, king, of, the, independent, state, of, croatia, on, 18, may, 1941, under, the, name, of, tomislav, ii, and, he, appointed, paveli, as, prime, minister, in, march, 1942, aimone, succeeded, his, brother, to, become, the, 4th, duke, of, aosta, however, the, king, s, powers, were, purely, ceremonial, to, the, point, that, he, never, even, visited, croatia, during, his, reign, but, preferred, to, deal, with, his, royal, duties, from, an, office, in, rome, on, 10, july, 1941, paveli, accepted, the, annexation, of, me, imurje, by, hungary, on, 14, april, 1941, in, one, of, his, first, acts, after, assuming, power, paveli, signed, the, decree, law, concerning, the, preservation, of, croatian, national, property, which, annulled, all, large, property, transactions, made, by, jews, in, the, two, months, prior, to, the, proclamation, of, the, ndh, he, signed, the, law, decree, on, protection, of, the, nation, and, the, state, on, 17, april, 1941, which, came, into, effect, immediately, was, retrospective, and, imposed, the, death, penalty, for, any, actions, causing, harm, to, the, honour, or, vital, interests, of, the, ndh, this, law, was, the, first, of, three, decrees, that, effectively, placed, the, serb, jewish, and, roma, populations, of, the, ndh, outside, the, law, and, lead, to, their, persecution, and, destruction, on, 19, and, 22, april, the, ustashe, issued, decrees, suspending, all, employees, of, state, and, local, governments, and, state, enterprises, this, allowed, the, new, regime, to, get, rid, of, all, unwanted, employees, in, principle, this, meant, all, jews, serbs, and, all, yugoslav, oriented, croats, on, 25, april, 1941, he, signed, into, law, a, decree, prohibiting, the, use, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, which, directly, impacted, on, the, serbian, orthodox, population, of, the, ndh, as, the, rites, of, the, church, were, written, in, cyrillic, on, 30, april, 1941, paveli, enacted, the, law, concerning, nationality, which, essentially, made, all, jews, non, citizens, and, this, was, followed, by, further, laws, restricting, their, movement, and, residency, from, 23, may, all, jews, were, required, to, wear, yellow, identification, tags, and, on, 26, june, paveli, issued, a, decree, which, blamed, jews, for, activities, against, the, ndh, and, ordered, their, internment, in, concentration, camps, as, prime, minister, of, the, ndh, paveli, had, full, control, over, the, state, the, oath, taken, by, all, government, employees, declared, that, paveli, represented, the, sovereignty, of, the, ndh, his, title, poglavnik, represented, the, close, ties, between, the, croatian, state, and, the, usta, e, movement, since, he, had, the, same, title, as, leader, of, the, usta, e, moreover, paveli, made, all, significant, decisions, including, naming, state, ministers, and, leaders, of, the, usta, e, as, the, ndh, had, no, functional, legislature, paveli, approved, all, of, the, laws, which, made, him, the, most, powerful, person, in, the, state, through, the, incorporation, of, the, extreme, right, wing, of, the, popular, hss, paveli, s, regime, was, initially, accepted, by, the, majority, of, croats, in, the, ndh, the, regime, also, attempted, to, re, write, history, by, falsely, claiming, the, legacy, of, the, founder, of, the, hss, stjepan, radi, and, that, of, croatian, nationalist, ante, star, evi, soon, afterwards, paveli, visited, pope, pius, xii, in, may, 1941, attempting, to, win, vatican, recognition, but, failed, although, the, papacy, placed, a, legat, in, zagreb, the, vatican, maintained, relations, with, the, yugoslav, government, in, exile, on, 9, june, 1941, paveli, visited, hitler, at, the, berghof, hitler, impressed, on, paveli, that, he, should, maintain, a, policy, of, national, intolerance, for, fifty, years, hitler, also, encouraged, paveli, to, accept, slovenian, immigrants, and, deport, serbs, to, the, territory, of, the, military, commander, in, serbia, over, the, next, few, months, the, usta, e, deported, around, 120, 000, serbs, in, july, 1941, the, german, plenipotentiary, general, in, the, ndh, edmund, glaise, von, horstenau, met, with, paveli, to, express, his, grave, concern, over, the, excesses, of, the, usta, e, this, was, the, first, of, many, occasions, over, the, next, three, years, during, which, von, horstenau, and, paveli, clashed, over, the, conduct, of, the, usta, e, by, the, end, of, 1941, the, acceptance, of, the, usta, e, regime, by, most, croats, had, been, transformed, into, disappointment, and, discontent, and, as, a, result, of, the, terror, perpetrated, by, the, regime, some, pro, yugoslav, sentiment, was, beginning, to, re, emerge, along, with, pro, communist, feelings, the, discontent, was, made, worse, when, paveli, had, vladko, ma, ek, arrested, and, sent, to, jasenovac, concentration, camp, in, october, 1941, by, the, end, of, 1941, hss, propaganda, leaflets, were, urging, peasants, to, be, patient, as, the, day, of, liberation, is, near, in, the, public, arena, there, were, efforts, to, create, a, cult, of, personality, around, paveli, these, efforts, included, the, imposition, of, a, nazi, style, salute, emphasising, that, he, had, been, sentenced, to, death, in, absentia, by, a, yugoslav, court, and, repeatedly, claiming, that, he, had, undergone, great, hardship, to, achieve, the, independence, of, the, ndh, paveli, summoned, the, sabor, on, 24, january, 1942, it, met, between, 23, and, 28, february, but, it, had, little, influence, and, after, december, 1942, was, never, called, again, on, 3, march, 1942, hitler, awarded, paveli, the, grand, cross, of, the, order, of, the, german, eagle, siegfried, kasche, the, german, envoy, handed, it, to, him, in, zagreb, eugen, dido, kvaternik, son, of, slavko, kvaternik, and, one, of, the, main, protagonists, in, the, usta, e, genocide, of, the, serbs, stated, that, paveli, directed, croat, nationalism, against, the, serbs, in, order, to, distract, the, croat, population, from, a, potential, backlash, against, the, italians, over, his, territorial, concessions, to, them, in, dalmatia, the, worst, policies, directed, against, minorities, were, usta, e, run, concentration, and, forced, labor, camps, the, most, notorious, camp, was, the, jasenovac, concentration, camp, where, 80, 000, 100, 000, people, died, including, around, 18, 000, croatian, jews, or, around, 90, of, the, pre, world, war, ii, jewish, community, paveli, founded, the, croatian, orthodox, church, with, the, aim, of, pacifying, the, serbs, however, the, underlying, ideology, behind, the, creation, of, the, croatian, orthodox, church, was, connected, to, the, ideas, of, ante, star, evi, who, considered, that, serbs, were, orthodox, croats, and, reflected, a, desire, to, create, a, croatian, state, comprising, three, main, religious, groupings, roman, catholic, muslim, and, croatian, orthodox, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, status, of, sarajevo, serbs, improved, after, they, joined, the, croatian, orthodox, church, in, significant, numbers, through, both, forcible, and, voluntary, conversions, between, 1941, and, 1945, 244, 000, serbs, were, converted, to, catholicism, in, june, 1942, paveli, met, with, general, roatta, and, they, agreed, that, usta, e, administration, could, be, returned, to, zone, 3, except, in, towns, with, italian, garrisons, paveli, agreed, to, the, continued, presence, of, the, chetnik, anti, communist, volunteer, militia, in, this, zone, and, that, the, italians, would, intervene, in, zone, 3, if, they, considered, that, was, necessary, the, result, of, this, agreement, was, that, italian, forces, largely, withdrew, from, areas, that, the, ndh, had, virtually, no, presence, and, no, means, by, which, to, reimpose, their, authority, this, created, a, wide, no, man, s, land, from, the, sand, ak, to, western, bosnia, in, which, the, chetniks, and, partisans, could, operate, by, mid, 1942, paveli, s, regime, effectively, controlled, only, the, zagreb, region, along, with, some, larger, towns, that, were, home, to, strong, ndh, and, german, garrisons, paveli, loyalists, mainly, usta, e, wanted, to, fight, the, communist, led, partisans, while, others, unnerved, by, the, idea, of, a, new, yugoslavia, also, supported, him, in, 1941, 42, the, majority, of, partisans, in, croatia, were, serbs, but, by, october, 1943, the, majority, were, croats, this, change, was, partly, due, to, the, decision, of, a, key, croatian, peasant, party, member, bo, idar, magovac, to, join, the, partisans, in, june, 1943, and, partly, due, to, the, capitulation, of, italy, paveli, and, his, government, devoted, attention, to, culture, although, most, literature, was, propaganda, many, books, did, not, have, an, ideological, basis, which, allowed, croatian, culture, to, flourish, the, croatian, national, theatre, received, many, world, famous, actors, as, visitors, the, major, cultural, milestone, was, the, publication, of, the, croatian, encyclopedia, a, work, later, outlawed, under, the, communist, regime, in, 1941, the, croatian, football, association, joined, fifa, on, 16, december, 1941, paveli, met, with, italian, foreign, minister, ciano, in, venice, and, advised, him, that, there, were, no, more, than, 12, 000, jews, left, in, the, ndh, in, the, second, half, of, 1942, the, wehrmacht, commander, in, chief, of, the, south, east, generaloberst, alexander, l, hr, and, glaise, urged, hitler, to, have, paveli, remove, both, the, incompetent, slavko, kvaternik, and, his, son, the, bloodthirsty, eugen, dido, kvaternik, from, power, when, paveli,
