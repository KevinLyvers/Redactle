after, the, death, of, his, father, in, the, aftermath, of, the, panic, of, 1907, some, of, the, loss, was, due, to, his, uncle, ansel, easton, and, cedric, wright, s, father, george, secretly,

avant, garde, composer, gave, adams, some, lessons, over, the, next, decade, three, music, teachers, pushed, him, to, develop, technique, and, discipline, and, he, became, determined, to, pursue, a, career, as, a, classical, pianist, adams, first, visited, yosemite, national, park, in, 1916, with, his, family, he, wrote, of, his, first, view, of, the, valley, the, splendor, of, yosemite, burst, upon, us, and, it, was, glorious, one, wonder, after, another, descended, upon, us, there, was, light, everywhere, a, new, era, began, for, me, his, father, gave, him, his, first, camera, during, that, stay, an, eastman, kodak, brownie, box, camera, and, he, took, his, first, photographs, with, his, usual, hyperactive, enthusiasm, he, returned, to, yosemite, on, his, own, the, next, year, with, better, cameras, and, a, tripod, during, the, winters, of, 1917, and, 1918, he, learned, basic, darkroom, technique, while, working, part, time, for, a, san, francisco, photograph, finisher,

cleanliness, he, was, afraid, to, touch, anything, without, immediately, washing, his, hands, afterwards, over, the, objections, of, his, doctor, he, prevailed, on, his, parents, to, take, him, back, to, yosemite, and, the, visit, cured, him, of, his, disease, and, compulsions, adams, avidly, read, photography, magazines, attended, camera, club, meetings, and, went, to, photography, and, art, exhibits, he, explored, the, high, sierra, during, summer, and, winter, with, retired, geologist, and, amateur, ornithologist, francis, holman, whom, he, called, uncle, frank, holman, taught, him, camping, and, climbing, however, their, shared, ignorance, of, safe, climbing, techniques, such, as, belaying, almost, led, to, disaster, on, more, than, one, occasion, while, in, yosemite, adams, had, need, of, a, piano, to, practice, on, a, ranger, introduced, him, to, landscape, painter, harry, best, who, kept, a, studio, home, in, yosemite, and, lived, there, during, the, summers, best, allowed, adams, to, practice, on, his, old, square, piano, adams, grew, interested, in, best, s, daughter, virginia, and, later, married, her, on, her, father, s, death, in, 1936, virginia, inherited, the, studio, and, continued, to, operate, it, until, 1971, the, studio, is, now, known, as, the, ansel, adams, gallery, and, remains, owned, by, the, adams, family, at, age, 17, adams, joined, the, sierra, club, a, group, dedicated, to, protecting, the, wild, places, of, the, earth, and, he, was, hired, as, the, summer, caretaker, of, the, sierra, club, visitor, facility, in, yosemite, valley, the, leconte, memorial, lodge, from, 1920, to, 1923, he, remained, a, member, throughout, his, lifetime, and, served, as, a, director, as, did, his, wife, he, was, first, elected, to, the, sierra, club, s, board, of, directors, in, 1934, and, served, on, the, board, for, 37, years, adams, participated, in, the, club, s, annual, high, trips, later, becoming, assistant, manager, and, official, photographer, for, the, trips, he, is, credited, with, several, first, ascents, in, the, sierra, nevada, during, his, twenties, most, of, his, friends, had, musical, associations, particularly, violinist, and, amateur, photographer, cedric, wright, who, became, his, best, friend, as, well, as, his, philosophical, and, cultural, mentor, their, shared, philosophy, was, from, edward, carpenter, s, towards, democracy, a, literary, work, which, endorsed, the, pursuit, of, beauty, in, life, and, art, for, several, years, adams, carried, a, pocket, edition, with, him, while, at, yosemite, and, it, became, his, personal, philosophy, as, well, he, later, stated, i, believe, in, beauty, i, believe, in, stones, and, water, air, and, soil, people, and, their, future, and, their, fate, during, summer, adams, would, enjoy, a, life, of, hiking, camping, and, photographing, and, the, rest, of, the, year, he, worked, to, improve, his, piano, playing, perfecting, his, piano, technique, and, musical, expression, he, also, gave, piano, lessons, for, extra, income, that, allowed, him, to, purchase, a, grand, piano, suitable, to, his, musical, ambitions, adams, was, still, planning, a, career, in, music, he, felt, that, his, small, hands, limited, his, repertoire, but, qualified, judges, considered, him, a, gifted, pianist, however, when, he, formed, the, milanvi, trio, with, a, violinist, and, a, dancer, he, proved, a, poor, accompanist, it, took, seven, more, years, for, him, to, conclude, that, at, best, he, might, become, only, a, concert, pianist, of, limited, range, an, accompanist, or, a, piano, teacher, adams, s, first, photographs, were, published, in, 1921, and, best, s, studio, began, selling, his, yosemite, prints, the, next, year, his, early, photos, already, showed, careful, composition, and, sensitivity, to, tonal, balance, in, letters, and, cards, to, family, he, wrote, of, having, dared, to, climb, to, the, best, viewpoints, and, to, brave, the, worst, elements, during, the, mid, 1920s, the, fashion, in, photography, was, pictorialism, which, strove, to, imitate, paintings, with, soft, focus, diffused, light, and, other, techniques, adams, experimented, with, such, techniques, as, well, as, the, bromoil, process, which, involved, brushing, an, oily, ink, onto, the, paper, an, example, is, lodgepole, pines, lyell, fork, of, the, merced, river, yosemite, national, park, originally, named, tamarack, pine, taken, in, 1921, adams, used, a, soft, focus, lens, capturing, a, glowing, luminosity, that, captured, the, mood, of, a, magical, summer, afternoon, for, a, short, time, adams, used, hand, coloring, but, declared, in, 1923, that, he, would, do, this, no, longer, by, 1925, he, had, rejected, pictorialism, altogether, for, a, more, realistic, approach, that, relied, on, sharp, focus, heightened, contrast, precise, exposure, and, darkroom, craftsmanship, in, 1927, adams, began, working, with, albert, m, bender, a, san, francisco, insurance, magnate, and, arts, patron, bender, helped, adams, produce, his, first, portfolio, in, his, new, style, parmelian, prints, of, the, high, sierras, which, included, his, famous, image, monolith, the, face, of, half, dome, which, was, taken, with, his, korona, view, camera, using, glass, plates, and, a, dark, red, filter, to, heighten, the, tonal, contrasts, on, that, excursion, he, had, only, one, plate, left, and, he, visualized, the, effect, of, the, blackened, sky, before, risking, the, last, image, he, later, said, i, had, been, able, to, realize, a, desired, image, not, the, way, the, subject, appeared, in, reality, but, how, it, felt, to, me, and, how, it, must, appear, in, the, finished, print, one, biographer, calls, monolith, adams, s, most, significant, photograph, because, the, extreme, manipulation, of, tonal, values, was, a, departure, from, all, previous, photography, adams, s, concept, of, visualization, which, he, first, defined, in, print, in, 1934, became, a, core, principle, in, his, photography, adams, s, first, portfolio, was, a, success, earning, nearly, 3, 900, with, the, sponsorship, and, promotion, of, bender, soon, he, received, commercial, assignments, to, photograph, the, wealthy, patrons, who, bought, his, portfolio, he, also, began, to, understand, how, important, it, was, that, his, carefully, crafted, photos, were, reproduced, to, best, effect, at, bender, s, invitation, he, joined, the, roxburghe, club, an, association, devoted, to, fine, printing, and, high, standards, in, book, arts, he, learned, much, about, printing, techniques, inks, design, and, layout, which, he, later, applied, to, other, projects, adams, married, virginia, best, in, 1928, after, a, pause, from, 1925, to, 1926, during, which, he, had, brief, relationships, with, various, women, the, newlyweds, moved, in, with, his, parents, to, save, expenses, the, following, year, they, had, a, home, built, next, door, and, connected, it, to, the, older, house, by, a, hallway, between, 1929, and, 1942, adams, s, work, matured, and, he, became, more, established, the, 1930s, were, a, particularly, experimental, and, productive, time, for, him, he, expanded, the, technical, range, of, his, works, emphasizing, detailed, close, ups, as, well, as, large, forms, from, mountains, to, factories, bender, took, adams, on, visits, to, taos, new, mexico, where, adams, met, and, made, friends, with, the, poet, robinson, jeffers, artists, john, marin, and, georgia, o, keeffe, and, photographer, paul, strand, his, talkative, high, spirited, nature, combined, with, his, excellent, piano, playing, made, him, popular, among, his, artist, friends, his, first, book, taos, pueblo, was, published, in, 1930, with, text, by, writer, mary, hunter, austin, strand, proved, especially, influential, adams, was, impressed, by, the, simplicity, and, detail, of, strand, s, negatives, which, showed, a, style, that, ran, counter, to, the, soft, focus, impressionistic, pictorialism, still, popular, at, the, time, strand, shared, secrets, of, his, technique, with, adams, and, convinced, him, to, pursue, photography, fully, one, of, strand, s, suggestions, that, adams, adopted, was, to, use, glossy, paper, to, intensify, tonal, values, adams, put, on, his, first, solo, museum, exhibition, pictorial, photographs, of, the, sierra, nevada, mountains, by, ansel, adams, at, the, smithsonian, institution, in, 1931, it, featured, 60, prints, taken, in, the, high, sierra, and, the, canadian, rockies, he, received, a, favorable, review, from, the, washington, post, his, photographs, are, like, portraits, of, the, giant, peaks, which, seem, to, be, inhabited, by, mythical, gods, despite, his, success, adams, felt, that, he, was, not, yet, up, to, the, standards, of, strand, he, decided, to, broaden, his, subject, matter, to, include, still, life, and, close, up, photos, and, to, achieve, higher, quality, by, visualizing, each, image, before, taking, it, he, emphasized, the, use, of, small, apertures, and, long, exposures, in, natural, light, which, created, sharp, details, with, a, wide, range, of, distances, in, focus, as, demonstrated, in, rose, and, driftwood, 1933, one, of, his, finest, still, life, photographs, in, 1932, adams, had, a, group, show, at, the, m, h, de, young, museum, with, imogen, cunningham, and, edward, weston, and, they, soon, formed, group, f, 64, which, espoused, pure, or, straight, photography, over, pictorialism, f, 64, being, a, very, small, aperture, setting, that, gives, great, depth, of, field, the, group, s, manifesto, stated, pure, photography, is, defined, as, possessing, no, qualities, of, technique, composition, or, idea, derivative, of, any, other, art, form, imitating, the, example, of, photographer, alfred, stieglitz, adams, opened, his, own, art, and, photography, gallery, in, san, francisco, in, 1933, he, also, began, to, publish, essays, in, photography, magazines, and, wrote, his, first, instructional, book, making, a, photograph, in, 1935, during, the, summers, adams, often, participated, in, sierra, club, high, trips, outings, as, a, paid, photographer, for, the, group, and, the, rest, of, the, year, a, core, group, of, club, members, socialized, regularly, in, san, francisco, and, berkeley, in, 1933, his, first, child, michael, was, born, followed, by, anne, two, years, later, during, the, 1930s, adams, began, to, deploy, his, photographs, in, the, cause, of, wilderness, preservation, he, was, inspired, partly, by, the, increasing, incursion, into, yosemite, valley, of, commercial, development, including, a, pool, hall, bowling, alley, golf, course, shops, and, automobile, traffic, he, created, the, limited, edition, book, sierra, nevada, the, john, muir, trail, in, 1938, as, part, of, the, sierra, club, s, efforts, to, secure, the, designation, of, kings, canyon, as, a, national, park, this, book, and, his, testimony, before, congress, played, a, vital, role, in, the, success, of, that, effort, and, congress, designated, kings, canyon, as, a, national, park, in, 1940, in, 1935, adams, created, many, new, photographs, of, the, sierra, nevada, and, one, of, his, most, famous, clearing, winter, storm, depicted, the, entire, yosemite, valley, just, as, a, winter, storm, abated, leaving, a, fresh, coat, of, snow, he, gathered, his, recent, work, and, had, a, solo, show, at, stieglitz, s, an, american, place, gallery, in, new, york, in, 1936, the, exhibition, proved, successful, with, both, the, critics, and, the, buying, public, and, earned, adams, strong, praise, from, the, revered, stieglitz, the, following, year, the, negative, for, clearing, winter, storm, was, almost, destroyed, when, the, darkroom, in, yosemite, caught, fire, with, the, help, of, edward, weston, and, charis, wilson, weston, s, future, wife, adams, put, out, the, fire, but, thousands, of, negatives, including, hundreds, that, had, never, been, printed, were, lost, in, 1937, adams, o, keeffe, and, friends, organized, a, month, long, camping, trip, in, arizona, with, orville, cox, the, head, wrangler, at, ghost, ranch, as, their, guide, both, artists, created, new, work, during, this, trip, adams, made, a, candid, portrait, of, o, keeffe, with, cox, on, the, rim, of, canyon, de, chelly, adams, once, remarked, some, of, my, best, photographs, have, been, made, in, and, on, the, rim, of, canyon, their, works, set, in, the, desert, southwest, are, often, published, and, exhibited, together, during, the, rest, of, the, 1930s, adams, took, on, many, commercial, assignments, to, supplement, the, income, from, the, struggling, best, s, studio, he, depended, on, such, assignments, financially, until, the, 1970s, some, of, his, clients, included, kodak, fortune, magazine, pacific, gas, and, electric, company, at, t, and, the, american, trust, company, he, photographed, timothy, l, pflueger, s, new, patent, leather, bar, for, the, st, francis, hotel, in, 1939, the, same, year, he, was, named, an, editor, of, u, s, camera, travel, the, most, popular, photography, magazine, at, that, time, in, 1940, adams, created, a, pageant, of, photography, the, largest, and, most, important, photography, show, in, the, west, to, date, attended, by, millions, of, visitors, with, his, wife, adams, completed, a, children, s, book, and, the, very, successful, illustrated, guide, to, yosemite, valley, during, 1940, and, 1941, he, also, taught, photography, by, giving, workshops, in, detroit, adams, also, began, his, first, serious, stint, of, teaching, which, included, the, training, of, military, photographers, in, 1941, at, the, art, center, school, of, los, angeles, now, known, as, the, art, center, college, of, design, in, 1941, adams, contracted, with, the, national, park, service, to, make, photographs, of, national, parks, indian, reservations, and, other, locations, managed, by, the, department, for, use, as, mural, sized, prints, to, decorate, the, department, s, new, building, the, contract, was, for, 180, days, adams, set, off, on, a, road, trip, with, his, friend, cedric, and, his, son, michael, intending, to, combine, work, on, the, mural, project, with, commissions, for, the, u, s, potash, company, and, standard, oil, with, some, days, reserved, for, personal, work, while, in, new, mexico, for, the, project, adams, photographed, a, scene, of, the, moon, rising, above, a, modest, village, with, snow, covered, mountains, in, the, background, under, a, dominating, black, sky, the, photograph, is, one, of, his, most, famous, and, is, named, moonrise, hernandez, new, mexico, adams, s, description, in, his, later, books, of, how, it, was, made, probably, enhanced, the, photograph, s, fame, the, light, on, the, crosses, in, the, foreground, was, rapidly, fading, and, he, could, not, find, his, exposure, meter, however, he, remembered, the, luminance, of, the, moon, and, used, it, to, calculate, the, proper, exposure, adams, s, earlier, account, was, less, dramatic, stating, simply, that, the, photograph, was, made, after, sunset, with, exposure, determined, using, his, weston, master, meter, however, the, exposure, was, actually, determined, the, foreground, was, underexposed, the, highlights, in, the, clouds, were, quite, dense, and, the, negative, proved, difficult, to, print, the, initial, publication, of, moonrise, was, in, u, s, camera, 1943, annual, after, being, selected, by, the, photo, judge, for, u, s, camera, edward, steichen, this, gave, moonrise, an, audience, before, its, first, formal, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, 1944, over, nearly, 40, years, adams, re, interpreted, the, image, his, most, popular, by, far, using, the, latest, darkroom, equipment, at, his, disposal, making, over, 1, 369, unique, prints, mostly, in, 16, by, 20, format, many, of, the, prints, were, made, during, the, 1970s, with, their, sale, finally, giving, adams, financial, independence, from, commercial, projects, the, total, value, of, these, original, prints, exceeds, 25, 000, 000, the, highest, price, paid, for, a, single, print, of, moonrise, reached, 609, 600, at, a, 2006, sotheby, s, auction, in, new, york, the, mural, project, ended, on, june, 30, 1942, and, because, of, the, world, war, the, murals, were, never, created, adams, sent, a, total, of, 225, small, prints, to, the, doi, but, held, on, to, the, 229, negatives, these, include, many, famous, images, such, as, the, tetons, and, the, snake, river, although, they, were, legally, the, property, of, the, u, s, government, he, knew, that, the, national, archives, did, not, take, proper, care, of, photographic, material, and, used, various, subterfuges, to, evade, queries, the, ownership, of, one, image, in, particular, has, attracted, interest, moonrise, although, adams, kept, meticulous, records, of, his, travel, and, expenses, he, was, less, disciplined, about, recording, the, dates, of, his, images, and, he, neglected, to, note, the, date, of, moonrise, but, the, position, of, the, moon, allowed, the, image, to, be, eventually, dated, from, astronomical, calculations, and, in, 1991, dennis, di, cicco, of, sky, telescope, determined, that, moonrise, was, made, on, november, 1, 1941, since, this, was, a, day, for, which, he, had, not, billed, the, department, the, image, belonged, to, adams, when, edward, steichen, formed, his, naval, aviation, photographic, unit, in, early, 1942, he, wanted, adams, to, be, a, member, to, build, and, direct, a, state, of, the, art, darkroom, and, laboratory, in, washington, d, c, around, february, 1942, steichen, asked, adams, to, join, him, in, the, navy, adams, agreed, but, with, two, conditions, he, wanted, to, be, commissioned, as, an, officer, and, he, would, not, be, available, until, july, 1, steichen, who, wanted, the, team, assembled, as, quickly, as, possible, passed, on, adams, and, had, his, other, photographers, ready, by, early, april, adams, was, distressed, by, the, japanese, american, internment, that, occurred, after, the, pearl, harbor,

resistance, and, was, rejected, by, many, as, disloyal, this, work, was, a, significant, departure, stylistically, and, philosophically, from, the, work, for, which, adams, is, generally, known, he, also, contributed, to, the, war, effort, by, doing, many, photographic, assignments, for, the, military, including, making, prints, of, secret, japanese, installations, in, the, aleutians, in, 1943, adams, had, a, camera, platform, mounted, on, his, station, wagon, to, afford, him, a, better, vantage, point, over, the, immediate, foreground, and, a, better, angle, for, expansive, backgrounds, most, of, his, landscapes, from, that, time, forward, were, made, from, the, roof, of, his, car, rather, than, from, summits, reached, by, rugged, hiking, as, in, his, earlier, days, adams, was, the, recipient, of, three, guggenheim, fellowships, during, his, career, the, first, being, awarded, in, 1946, to, photograph, every, national, park, at, that, time, there, were, 28, national, parks, and,

in, the, introduction, to, ansel, adams, classic, images, 1985, p, 5, the, love, that, americans, poured, out, for, the, work, and, person, of, ansel, adams, during, his, old, age, and, that, they, have, continued, to, express, with, undiminished, enthusiasm, since, his, death, is, an, extraordinary, phenomenon, perhaps, even, unparalleled, in, our, country, s, response, to, a, visual, artist, adams, wife, virginia, rose, best, died, on, january, 29, 2000, aged, 96, romantic, landscape, artists, albert, bierstadt, and, thomas, moran, portrayed, the, grand, canyon, and, yosemite, during, the, 19th, century, followed, by, photographers, carleton, watkins, eadweard, muybridge, and, george, fiske, adams, s, work, is, distinguished, from, theirs, by, his, interest, in, the, transient, and, ephemeral, he, photographed, at, varying, times, of, the, day, and, of, the, year, capturing, the, landscape, s, changing, light, and, atmosphere, art, critic, john, szarkowski, wrote, ansel, adams, attuned, himself, more, precisely, than, any, photographer, before, him, to, a, visual, understanding, of, the, specific, quality, of, the, light, that, fell, on, a, specific, place, at, a, specific, moment, for, adams, the, natural, landscape, is, not, a, fixed, and, solid, sculpture, but, an, insubstantial, image, as, transient, as, the, light, that, continually, redefines, it, this, sensibility, to, the, specificity, of, light, was, the, motive, that, forced, adams, to, develop, his, legendary, photographic, technique, the, creation, of, adams, s, grand, highly, detailed, images, was, driven, by, his, interest, in, the, natural, environment, with, increasing, environmental, degradation, in, the, west, during, the, 20th, century, his, photos, show, a, commitment, to, conservation, his, black, and, white, photographs, were, not, just, documentation, but, reflected, a, sublime, experience, of, nature, as, a, spiritual, place, in, 1955, edward, steichen, selected, adams, s, mount, williamson, for, the, world, touring, museum, of, modern, art, exhibition, the, family, of, man, which, was, seen, by, nine, million, visitors, at, 10, by, 12, feet, 3, 0, by, 3, 7, m, his, was, the, largest, print, in, the, exhibition, presented, floor, to, ceiling, in, a, prominent, position, as, the, backdrop, to, the, section, relationships, as, a, reminder, of, the, essential, reliance, of, humanity, on, the, soil, however, despite, its, striking, and, prominent, display, adams, expressed, displeasure, at, the, gross, enlargement, and, poor, quality, of, the, print, in, 1932, adams, helped, form, the, anti, pictorialist, group, f, 64, a, loose, and, relatively, short, lived, association, of, like, minded, straight, or, pure, photographers, on, the, west, coast, whose, members, included, edward, weston, and, imogen, cunningham, the, modernist, group, favored, sharp, focus, f, 64, being, a, very, small, aperture, setting, that, gives, great, depth, of, field, on, large, format, view, cameras, contact, printing, precisely, exposed, images, of, natural, forms, and, found, objects, and, the, use, of, the, entire, tonal, range, of, a, photograph, adams, wrote, the, group, s, manifesto, for, their, exhibition, at, the, de, young, museum, group, f, 64, limits, its, members, and, invitational, names, to, those, workers, who, are, striving, to, define, photography, as, an, art, form, by, a, simple, and, direct, presentation, through, purely, photographic, methods, the, group, will, show, no, work, at, any, time, that, does, not, conform, to, its, standards, of, pure, photography, pure, photography, is, defined, as, possessing, no, qualities, of, composition, or, ideas, derivative, of, any, other, art, form, the, production, of, the, pictorialist, on, the, other, hand, indicates, a, devotion, to, principles, of, art, which, are, directly, related, to, painting, and, the, graphic, arts, the, members, of, group, f, 64, believe, that, photography, as, an, art, form, must, develop, along, lines, defined, by, the, actualities, and, limitations, of, the, photographic, medium, and, must, always, remain, independent, of, ideological, conventions, of, art, and, aesthetics, that, are, reminiscent, of, a, period, of, culture, antedating, the, growth, of, the, medium, itself, the, f, 64, school, met, with, opposition, from, the, pictorialists, particularly, william, mortensen, who, called, their, work, hard, and, brittle, adams, disliked, the, work, of, mortensen, and, disliked, him, personally, referring, to, him, as, the, anti, christ, the, purists, were, friends, with, prominent, historians, and, their, influence, led, to, the, exclusion, of, mortensen, from, histories, of, photography, adams, later, developed, this, purist, approach, into, the, zone, system, while, adams, and, portrait, photographer, fred, archer, were, teaching, at, the, art, center, school, in, los, angeles, around, 1939, 1940, they, developed, the, zone, system, for, managing, the, photographic, process, which, was, based, on, sensitometry, the, study, of, the, light, sensitivity, of, photographic, materials, and, the, relationship, between, exposure, time, and, the, resulting, density, on, a, negative, the, zone, system, provides, a, calibrated, scale, of, brightness, from, zone, 0, black, through, shades, of, gray, to, zone, x, white, the, photographer, can, take, light, readings, of, key, elements, in, a, scene, and, use, the, zone, system, to, determine, how, the, film, must, be, exposed, developed, and, printed, to, achieve, the, desired, brightness, or, darkness, in, the, final, image, although, it, originated, for, black, and, white, sheet, film, the, zone, system, can, be, applied, to, images, captured, on, roll, film, both, black, and, white, and, color, negative, and, reversal, and, to, digital, photography, in, 1940, with, trustee, david, h, mcalpin, and, curator, beaumont, newhall, adams, helped, establish, the, photography, department, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, in, new, york, moma, was, the, first, major, american, art, museum, to, establish, a, photography, department, adams, acted, as, mcalpin, and, newhall, s, primary, advisor, peter, galassi, the, chief, curator, of, the, department, in, later, years, said, adams, s, dedication, and, boundless, energy, were, vital, to, the, creation, of, the, department, and, to, its, programs, in, its, early, years, for, those, who, had, sought, institutional, recognition, for, photography, as, art, the, founding, of, the, department, was, an, important, moment, marking, the, medium, s, recognition, as, a, subject, equal, to, painting, and, sculpture, on, december, 31, 1940, the, department, opened, its, first, exhibition, sixty, photographs, a, survey, of, camera, esthetics, which, resembled, large, survey, exhibitions, that, adams, and, newhall, had, previously, mounted, independently, the, exhibition, took, aesthetic, quality, as, a, guiding, principle, a, philosophy, that, ran, counter, to, that, of, many, writers, and, critics, who, argued, that, the, medium, s, more, vernacular, use, as, a, means, of, communication, should, be, more, fully, represented, photographer, ralph, steiner, writing, for, pm, remarked, on, the, whole, it, seems, to, regard, photography, as, soft, music, at, high, tea, rather, than, as, a, jazz, at, a, beefsteak, supper, tom, maloney, publisher, of, u, s, camera, wrote, that, the, exhibition, was, very, choice, very, pristine, very, small, very, ultra, according, to, newhall, the, exhibition, was, meant, to, showcase, artistic, excellence, and, not, to, define, but, to, suggest, the, possibilities, of, photographic, vision, in, his, autobiography, adams, expressed, his, concern, about, americans, loss, of, connection, to, nature, in, the, course, of, industrialization, and, the, exploitation, of, the, land, s, natural, resources, he, stated, we, all, know, the, tragedy, of, the, dustbowls, the, cruel, unforgivable, erosions, of, the, soil, the, depletion, of, fish, or, game, and, the, shrinking, of, the, noble, forests, and, we, know, that, such, catastrophes, shrivel, the, spirit, of, the, people, the, wilderness, is, pushed, back, man, is, everywhere, solitude, so, vital, to, the, individual, man, is, almost, nowhere,

adams, wilderness, and, mount, ansel, adams, respectively, in, 1985, in, 1984, adams, was, inducted, into, the, international, photography, hall, of, fame, adams, was, known, mostly, for, his, boldly, printed, large, format, black, and, white, images, but, he, also, worked, extensively, with, color, however, he, preferred, black, and, white, photography, which, he, believed, could, be, manipulated, to, produce, a, wide, range, of, bold, expressive, tones, and, he, felt, constricted, by, the, rigidity, of, the, color, process, most, of, his, color, work, was, done, on, assignments, and, he, did, not, consider, his, color, work, to, be, important, or, expressive, even, explicitly, forbidding, any, posthumous, exploitation, of, his, color, work, most, of, adams, best, known, images, were, taken, with, 8x10, and, 4x5, view, cameras, he, also, used, a, variety, of, other, negative, formats, from, 35mm, and, medium, format, roll, film, through, less, common, formats, such, as, polaroid,
