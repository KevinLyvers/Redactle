interpreted, as, some, kind, of, role, playing, due, to, the, broad, range, of, situations, and, voices, he, created, and, used, recent, interpretations, however, call, attention, to, the, fact, that, in, some, sense, all, lyrical, poetry, can, be, understood, as, role, playing, which, makes, the, category, of, role, poems, coined, especially, for, pet, fi, superfluous, while, using, a, variety, of, voices, pet, fi, created, a, well, formed, persona, for, himself, a, jaunty, stubborn, loner, who, loves, wine, hates, all, kinds, of, limits, and, boundaries, and, is, passionate, in, all, he, feels, in, poems, such, as, j, vend, l, s, prophecy, 1843, he, imagines, himself, as, someone, who, will, die, young, after, doing, great, things, this, motif, recurs, in, the, revolutionary, poetry, of, his, later, years, the, influence, of, contemporary, almanac, poetry, can, be, best, seen, in, the, poem, cycle, cipruslombok, etelke, s, rj, ra, branches, of, cypress, for, etelke, s, tomb, 1845,
