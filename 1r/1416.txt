them, at, that, time, atat, rk, s, relations, with, enver, pasha, a, key, perpetrator, of, the, genocides, has, also, been, controversial, but, poorly, understood, while, the, two, men, may, have, been, close, at, times, atat, rk, held, a, personal, dislike, of, enver, pasha, he, once, said, to, a, confidant, that, enver, pasha, was, a, dangerous, figure, who, might, lead, the, country, to, ruin, the, primary, concern, towards, atat, rk, was, the, turkish, government, s, involvement, with, and, reaction, to, the, burning, of, smyrna, in, 1923, which, saw, muslim, turkish, mobs, and,

characteristics, of, the, turkish, nation, highlighting, the, public, s, lack, of, knowledge, regarding, atat, rk, s, intentions, the, public, cheered, we, are, returning, to, the, days, of, the, first, caliphs, atat, rk, placed, fevzi, akmak, k, z, m, zalp, and, smet, n, n, in, political, positions, where, they, could, institute, his, reforms, he, capitalized, on, his, reputation, as, an, efficient, military, leader, and, spent, the, following, years, up, until, his, death, in, 1938, instituting, political, economic, and, social, reforms, in, doing, so, he, transformed, turkish, society, from, perceiving, itself, as, a, muslim, part, of, a, vast, empire, into, a, modern, democratic, and, secular, nation, state, this, had, a, positive, influence, on, human, capital, because, from, then, on, what, mattered, at, school, was, science, and, education, islam, was, concentrated, in, mosques, and, religious, places, atat, rk, s, driving, goal, was, the, complete, independence, of, the, country, he, clarified, his, position, by, complete, independence, we, mean, of, course, complete, economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural, independence, and, freedom, in, all, matters, being, deprived, of, independence, in, any, of, these, is, equivalent, to, the, nation, and, country, being, deprived, of, all, its, independence, he, led, wide, ranging, reforms, in, social, cultural, and, economic, aspects, establishing, the, new, republic, s, backbone, of, legislative, judicial, and, economic, structures, though, he, was, later, idealized, by, some, as, an, originator, of, sweeping, reforms, many, of, his, reformist, ideas, were, already, common, in, ottoman, intellectual, circles, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, were, expressed, more, openly, after, the, young, turk, revolution, atat, rk, created, a, banner, to, mark, the, changes, between, the, old, ottoman, and, the, new, republican, rule, each, change, was, symbolized, as, an, arrow, in, this, banner, this, defining, ideology, of, the, republic, of, turkey, is, referred, to, as, the, six, arrows, or, kemalism, kemalism, is, based, on, atat, rk, s, conception, of, realism, and, pragmatism, the, fundamentals, of, nationalism, populism, and, statism, were, all, defined, under, the, six, arrows, these, fundamentals, were, not, new, in, world, politics, or, indeed, among, the, elite, of, turkey, what, made, them, unique, was, that, these, interrelated, fundamentals, were, explicitly, formulated, for, turkey, s, needs, a, good, example, is, the, definition, and, application, of, secularism, the, kemalist, secular, state, significantly, differed, from, predominantly, christian, states, atat, rk, s, private, journal, entries, dated, before, the, establishment, of, the, republic, in, 1923, show, that, he, believed, in, the, importance, of, the, sovereignty, of, the, people, in, forging, the, new, republic, the, turkish, revolutionaries, turned, their, back, on, the, perceived, corruption, and, decadence, of, cosmopolitan, constantinople, and, its, ottoman, heritage, for, instance, they, made, ankara, as, angora, has, been, known, in, english, since, 1930, the, country, s, new, capital, and, reformed, the, turkish, postal, service, once, a, provincial, town, deep, in, anatolia, the, city, was, thus, turned, into, the, center, of, the, independence, movement, atat, rk, wanted, a, direct, government, by, the, assembly, and, visualized, a, representative, democracy, parliamentary, sovereignty, where, the, national, parliament, would, be, the, ultimate, source, of, power, in, the, following, years, he, altered, his, stance, somewhat, the, country, needed, an, immense, amount, of, reconstruction, and, direct, government, by, the, assembly, could, not, survive, in, such, an, environment, the, revolutionaries, faced, challenges, from, the, supporters, of, the, old, ottoman, regime, and, also, from, the, supporters, of, newer, ideologies, such, as, communism, and, fascism, atat, rk, saw, the, consequences, of, fascist, and, communist, doctrines, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, and, rejected, both, he, prevented, the, spread, into, turkey, of, the, totalitarian, party, rule, which, held, sway, in, the, soviet, union, germany, and, italy, some, perceived, his, opposition, and, silencing, of, these, ideologies, as, a, means, of, eliminating, competition, others, believed, it, was, necessary, to, protect, the, young, turkish, state, from, succumbing, to, the, instability, of, new, ideologies, and, competing, factions, under, atat, rk, the, arrest, process, known, as, the, 1927, detentions, 1927, tevkifat, was, launched, and, a, widespread, arrest, policy, was, put, in, place, against, the, communist, party, of, turkey, members, communist, political, figures, such, as, hikmet, k, v, lc, ml, n, z, m, hikmet, and, efik, h, sn, were, tried, and, sentenced, to, prison, terms, then, in, 1937, a, delegation, headed, by, atat, rk, decided, to, censor, the, writings, of, k, v, lc, ml, as, harmful, communist, propaganda, the, heart, of, the, new, republic, was, the, gna, established, during, the, turkish, war, of, independence, by, atat, rk, the, elections, were, free, and, used, an, egalitarian, electoral, system, that, was, based, on, a, general, ballot, deputies, at, the, gna, served, as, the, voice, of, turkish, society, by, expressing, its, political, views, and, preferences, it, had, the, right, to, select, and, control, both, the, government, and, the, prime, minister, initially, it, also, acted, as, a, legislative, power, controlling, the, executive, branch, and, if, necessary, served, as, an, organ, of, scrutiny, under, the, turkish, constitution, of, 1921, the, turkish, constitution, of, 1924, set, a, loose, separation, of, powers, between, the, legislative, and, the, executive, organs, of, the, state, whereas, the, separation, of, these, two, within, the, judiciary, system, was, a, strict, one, atat, rk, then, the, president, occupied, a, dominant, position, in, this, political, system, the, one, party, regime, was, established, de, facto, in, 1925, after, the, adoption, of, the, 1924, constitution, the, only, political, party, of, the, gna, was, the, people, s, party, founded, by, atat, rk, on, 9, september, 1923, but, according, to, the, party, culture, the, foundation, date, was, the, opening, day, of, sivas, congress, on, 4, september, 1919, on, 10, november, 1924, it, was, renamed, cumhuriyet, halk, f, rkas, or, republican, people, s, party, the, word, f, rka, was, replaced, by, the, word, parti, in, 1935, the, abolition, of, the, caliphate, and, other, cultural, reforms, were, met, with, fierce, opposition, the, conservative, elements, were, not, appreciative, and, they, launched, attacks, on, the, kemalist, reformists, this, was, an, important, dimension, in, atat, rk, s, drive, to, reform, the, political, system, and, to, promote, national, sovereignty, by, the, consensus, of, the, muslim, majority, in, early, centuries, the, caliphate, was, the, core, political, concept, of, sunni, islam, abolishing, the, sultanate, was, easier, because, the, survival, of, the, caliphate, at, the, time, satisfied, the, partisans, of, the, sultanate, this, produced, a, split, system, with, the, new, republic, on, one, side, and, an, islamic, form, of, government, with, the, caliph, on, the, other, side, and, atat, rk, and, n, n, worried, that, it, nourished, the, expectations, that, the, sovereign, would, return, under, the, guise, of, caliph, caliph, abd, lmecid, ii, was, elected, after, the, abolition, of, the, sultanate, 1922, the, caliph, had, his, own, personal, treasury, and, also, had, a, personal, service, that, included, military, personnel, atat, rk, said, that, there, was, no, religious, or, political, justification, for, this, he, believed, that, caliph, abd, lmecid, ii, was, following, in, the, steps, of, the, sultans, in, domestic, and, foreign, affairs, accepting, of, and, responding, to, foreign, representatives, and, reserve, officers, and, participating, in, official, ceremonies, and, celebrations, he, wanted, to, integrate, the, powers, of, the, caliphate, into, the, powers, of, the, gna, his, initial, activities, began, on, 1, january, 1924, when, n, n, akmak, and, zalp, consented, to, the, abolition, of, the, caliphate, the, caliph, made, a, statement, to, the, effect, that, he, would, not, interfere, with, political, affairs, on, 1, march, 1924, at, the, assembly, atat, rk, said, the, religion, of, islam, will, be, elevated, if, it, will, cease, to, be, a, political, instrument, as, had, been, the, case, in, the, past, on, 3, march, 1924, the, caliphate, was, officially, abolished, and, its, powers, within, turkey, were, transferred, to, the, gna, other, muslim, nations, debated, the, validity, of, turkey, s, unilateral, abolition, of, the, caliphate, as, they, decided, whether, they, should, confirm, the, turkish, action, or, appoint, a, new, caliph, a, caliphate, conference, was, held, in, cairo, in, may, 1926, and, a, resolution, was, passed, declaring, the, caliphate, a, necessity, in, islam, but, failed, to, implement, this, decision, two, other, islamic, conferences, were, held, in, mecca, 1926, and, jerusalem, 1931, but, failed, to, reach, a, consensus, turkey, did, not, accept, the, re, establishment, of, the, caliphate, and, perceived, it, as, an, attack, to, its, basic, existence, meanwhile, atat, rk, and, the, reformists, continued, their, own, way, on, 8, april, 1924, sharia, courts, were, abolished, with, the, law, mehakim, i, er, iyenin, lgas, na, ve, mehakim, te, kilat, na, ait, ahkam, muaddil, kanun, the, removal, of, the, caliphate, was, followed, by, an, extensive, effort, to, establish, the, separation, of, governmental, and, religious, affairs, education, was, the, cornerstone, in, this, effort, in, 1923, there, were, three, main, educational, groups, of, institutions, the, most, common, institutions, were, medreses, based, on, arabic, the, qur, an, and, memorization, the, second, type, of, institution, was, idad, and, sultan, the, reformist, schools, of, the, tanzimat, era, the, last, group, included, colleges, and, minority, schools, in, foreign, languages, that, used, the, latest, teaching, models, in, educating, pupils, the, old, medrese, education, was, modernized, atat, rk, changed, the, classical, islamic, education, for, a, vigorously, promoted, reconstruction, of, educational, institutions, he, linked, educational, reform, to, the, liberation, of, the, nation, from, dogma, which, he, believed, was, more, important, than, the, turkish, war, of, independence, he, declared, today, our, most, important, and, most, productive, task, is, the, national, education, affairs, we, have, to, be, successful, in, national, education, affairs, and, we, shall, be, the, liberation, of, a, nation, is, only, achieved, through, this, way, in, the, summer, of, 1924, atat, rk, invited, american, educational, reformer, john, dewey, to, ankara, to, advise, him, on, how, to, reform, turkish, education, his, public, education, reforms, aimed, to, prepare, citizens, for, roles, in, public, life, through, increasing, public, literacy, he, wanted, to, institute, compulsory, primary, education, for, both, girls, and, boys, since, then, this, effort, has, been, an, ongoing, task, for, the, republic, he, pointed, out, that, one, of, the, main, targets, of, education, in, turkey, had, to, be, raising, a, generation, nourished, with, what, he, called, the, public, culture, the, state, schools, established, a, common, curriculum, which, became, known, as, the, unification, of, education, unification, of, education, was, put, into, force, on, 3, march, 1924, by, the, law, on, unification, of, education, no, 430, with, the, new, law, education, became, inclusive, organized, on, a, model, of, the, civil, community, in, this, new, design, all, schools, submitted, their, curriculum, to, the, ministry, of, national, education, a, government, agency, modeled, after, other, countries, ministries, of, education, concurrently, the, republic, abolished, the, two, ministries, and, made, clergy, subordinate, to, the, department, of, religious, affairs, one, of, the, foundations, of, secularism, in, turkey, the, unification, of,

inquiry, into, the, planners, shifted, to, a, sweeping, investigation, ostensibly, its, aims, were, to, uncover, subversive, activities, but, in, truth, the, investigation, was, used, to, undermine, those, disagreeing, with, atat, rk, s, cultural, reforms, the, investigation, brought, a, number, of, political, activists, before, the, tribunal, including, karabekir, the, leader, of, the, prp, a, number, of, surviving, leaders, of, the, committee, of, union, and, progress, including, mehmet, cavid, ahmed, kr, and, smail, canbulat, were, found, guilty, of, treason, and, hanged, because, the,

reformations, established, by, the, ottoman, empire, for, the, first, time, in, history, islamic, law, was, separated, from, secular, law, and, restricted, to, matters, of, religion, he, stated, we, must, liberate, our, concepts, of, justice, our, laws, and, our, legal, institutions, from, the, bonds, which, even, though, they, are, incompatible, with, the, needs, of, our, century, still, hold, a, tight, grip, on, us, on, 1, march, 1926, the, turkish, penal, code, modelled, after, the, italian, penal, code, was, passed, on, 4, october, 1926, islamic, courts, were, closed, establishing, the, civic, law, needed, time, so, atat, rk, delayed, the, inclusion, of, the, principle, of, la, cit, the, constitutional, principle, of, secularism, in, france, until, 5, february, 1937, in, keeping, with, the, islamic, practice, of, sex, segregation, ottoman, practice, discouraged, social, interaction, between, men, and, women, atat, rk, began, developing, social, reforms, to, address, this, issue, very, early, as, was, evident, in, his, personal, journal, he, and, his, staff, discussed, issues, such, as, abolishing, the, veiling, of, women, and, integrating, women, into, the, outside, world, his, plans, to, surmount, the, task, were, written, in, his, journal, in, november, 1915, the, social, change, can, come, by, 1, educating, capable, mothers, who, are, knowledgeable, about, life, 2, giving, freedom, to, women, 3, a, man, can, change, his, morals, thoughts, and, feelings, by, leading, a, common, life, with, a, woman, as, there, is, an, inborn, tendency, towards, the, attraction, of, mutual, affection, atat, rk, needed, a, new, civil, code, to, establish, his, second, major, step, of, giving, freedom, to, women, the, first, part, was, the, education, of, girls, a, feat, established, with, the, unification, of, education, on, 4, october, 1926, the, new, turkish, civil, code, modelled, after, the, swiss, civil, code, was, passed, under, the, new, code, women, gained, equality, with, men, in, such, matters, as, inheritance, and, divorce, since, atat, rk, did, not, consider, gender, a, factor, in, social, organization, according, to, his, view, society, marched, towards, its, goal, with, men, and, women, united, he, believed, that, it, was, scientifically, impossible, for, turkey, to, achieve, progress, and, become, civilized, if, ottoman, gender, separation, persisted, during, a, meeting, he, declaimed, to, the, women, win, for, us, the, battle, of, education, and, you, will, do, yet, more, for, your, country, than, we, have, been, able, to, do, it, is, to, you, that, i, appeal, to, the, men, if, henceforward, the, women, do, not, share, in, the, social, life, of, the, nation, we, shall, never, attain, to, our, full, development, we, shall, remain, irremediably, backward, incapable, of, treating, on, equal, terms, with, the, civilizations, of, the, west, additionally, the, kemalist, one, party, period, of, turkey, s, labor, participation, rate, was, as, high, as, 70, the, participation, rate, continued, to, decline, after, the, democratization, of, turkey, due, to, the, backlash, of, conservative, norms, in, turkish, society, in, 1927, the, state, art, and, sculpture, museum, ankara, resim, ve, heykel, m, zesi, opened, its, doors, the, museum, highlighted, sculpture, which, was, rarely, practised, in, turkey, due, to, the, islamic, tradition, of, avoiding, idolatry, atat, rk, believed, that, culture, is, the, foundation, of, the, turkish, republic, and, described, modern, turkey, s, ideological, thrust, as, a, creation, of, patriotism, blended, with, a, lofty, humanist, ideal, he, included, both, his, own, nation, s, creative, legacy, and, what, he, saw, as, the, admirable, values, of, global, civilization,

was, literate, furthermore, the, american, reformer, john, dewey, invited, by, atat, rk, to, assist, in, educational, reform, found, that, learning, how, to, read, and, write, turkish, in, the,

plan, to, implement, a, new, alphabet, for, the, written, turkish, language, based, on, a, modified, latin, alphabet, the, new, turkish, alphabet, would, serve, as, a, replacement, for, the, old, arabic, script, and, a, solution, to, the, literacy, problem, since, the, new, alphabet, did, not, retain, the, complexities, of, the, arabic, script, and, could, be, learned, within, a, few, months, when, atat, rk, asked, the, language, experts, how, long, it, would, take, to, implement, the, new, alphabet, into, the, turkish, language, most, of, the, professors, and, linguists, said, between,

began, in, 1945, in, 1950, the, chp, ceded, the, majority, position, to, the, democratic, party, this, came, amidst, arguments, that, atat, rk, s, single, party, rule, did, not, promote, direct, democracy, the, reason, experiments, with, pluralism, failed, during, this, period, was, that, not, all, groups, in, the, country, had, agreed, to, a, minimal, consensus, regarding, shared, values, mainly, secularism, and, shared, rules, for, conflict, resolution, in, response, to, such, criticisms, atat, rk, s, biographer, andrew, mango, writes, between, the, two, wars, democracy, could, not,

have, been, expected, in, his, lifetime, even, though, at, times, he, did, not, appear, to, be, a, democrat, in, his, actions, atat, rk, always, supported, the, idea, of, building, a, civil, society, a, system, of, voluntary, civic, and, social, organizations, and, institutions, as, opposed, to, the, force, backed, structures, of, the, state, in, one, of, his, many, speeches, about, the,

primal, language, his, ideas, could, be, traced, to, the, work, by, the, french, scientist, hilaire, de, barenton, titled, l, origine, des, langues, des, religions, et, des, peuples, which, postulates, that, all, languages, originated, from, hieroglyphs, and, cuneiform, used, by, sumerians, and, the, paper, by, austrian, linguist, hermann, f, kvergi, of, vienna, titled, la, psychologie,

of, the, qur, an, were, published, in, istanbul, and, several, renderings, of, the, qur, an, in, the, turkish, language, were, read, in, front, of, the, public, creating, significant, controversy, these, turkish, qur, ans, were, fiercely, opposed, by, members, of, the, religious, community, and, the, incident, impelled, many, leading, muslim, modernists, to, call, upon, the, turkish, parliament, to, sponsor, a, qur, an, translation, of, suitable, quality, with, the, support, of, atat, rk, the, parliament, approved, the, project, and, the, directorate, of, religious, affairs,

in, 1932, atat, rk, justified, the, translation, of, the, qur, an, by, stating, how, he, wanted, to, teach, religion, in, turkish, to, turkish, people, who, had, been, practising, islam, without, understanding, it, for, centuries, atat, rk, believed, that, the, understanding, of, religion, and, its, texts, was, too, important, to, be, left, to, a, small, group, of, people, thus, his, objective, was, to, make, the, qur, an, accessible, to, a, broader, demographic, by, translating, it, into, modern, languages, in, 1934, atat, rk, commissioned, the, first, turkish, operatic, work,

reforms, was, expressed, in, the, civic, book, prepared, under, his, supervision, in, it, he, stated, there, is, no, logical, explanation, for, the, political, disenfranchisement, of, women, any, hesitation, and, negative, mentality, on, this, subject, is, nothing, more, than, a, fading, social, phenomenon, of, the, past, women, must, have, the, right, to, vote, and, to, be, elected, because,

create, a, nation, state, ulus, devlet, from, the, turkish, remnants, of, the, ottoman, empire, kemalism, defines, the, turkish, people, as, those, who, protect, and, promote, the, moral, spiritual, cultural, and, humanistic, values, of, the, turkish, nation, one, of, the, goals, of, the, establishment, of, the, new, turkish, state, was, to, ensure, the, domination, of, turkish, national, identity, in, every, aspect, of, social, life, from, the, language, that, people, speak, in, the, streets, to, the, language, to, be, taught, at, schools, from, the, education, to, the, industrial,

but, sponsored, by, the, government, this, campaign, aimed, to, put, pressure, on, non, turkish, speakers, to, speak, turkish, in, public, however, the, campaign, went, beyond, the, measures, of, a, mere, policy, of, speaking, turkish, to, an, outright, prevention, of, any, other, language, another, example, of, nationalisation, was, the, surname, law, which, obligated, the, turkish, people, to, adopt, fixed, hereditary, surnames, and, forbade, names, that, contained, connotations, of, foreign, cultures, nations, tribes, and, religions, as, a, result, many, ethnic, armenians, greeks, and,

almost, equally, desperate, measures, to, protect, their, interests, for, example, the, iraqi, revolt, against, the, british, was, suppressed, by, the, raf, iraq, command, during, the, summer, of, 1920, from, the, british, perspective, if, atat, rk, stabilized, turkey, he, would, then, turn, his, attention, to, mosul, and, penetrate, mesopotamia, where, the, native, population, would, likely, join, his, cause, such, an, event, would, result, in, an, insurgent, and, hostile, muslim, nation, in, close, proximity, to, british, territory, in, india, in, 1923, atat, rk, tried, to, persuade, the, gna, that, accepting, the, arbitration, of, the, league, of, nations, at, the, treaty, of, lausanne, did, not, signify, relinquishing, mosul, but, rather, waiting, for, a, time, when, turkey, might, be, stronger, nevertheless, the, artificially, drawn, border, had, an, unsettling, effect, on, the, population, on, both, sides, later, it, was, claimed, that, turkey, began, where, the, oil,

rebellion, was, on, the, rise, partly, because, of, the, continuing, uncertainties, along, the, northern, frontier, present, day, northern, iraq, the, committee, recommended, that, the, region, should, be, connected, to, iraq, with, the, condition, that, the, uk, would, hold, the, british, mandate, of, mesopotamia, by, the, end, of, march, 1925, the, necessary, troop, movements, were,

on, 5, june, 1926, which, mostly, followed, the, decisions, of, the, league, council, the, agreement, left, a, large, section, of, the, kurdish, population, and, the, iraqi, turkmen, on, the, non,

controlled, turkish, communist, party, to, forestall, the, perceived, spread, of, communist, ideas, in, the, country, and, gain, access, to, the, comintern, s, financing, despite, his, relations, with, the, soviet, union, atat, rk, was, not, willing, to, commit, turkey, to, communism, friendship, with, russia, he, said, is, not, to, adopt, their, ideology, of, communism, for, turkey, moreover, atat, rk, declared, communism, is, a, social, issue, social, conditions, religion, and, national, traditions, of, our, country, confirm, the, opinion, that, russian, communism, is, not, applicable, in, turkey, and, in, a, speech, on, 1, november, 1924, he, said, our, amicable, relations, with, our, old, friend, the, soviet, russian, republic, are, developing, and, progressing, every, day, as, in, past, our, republican, government, regards, genuine, and, extensive, good, relations, with, soviet, russia, as, the, keystone, of, our, foreign, policy, after, the, turks, withdrew, their,

britain, and, other, major, western, powers, which, caused, displeasure, on, the, part, of, the, soviets, the, second, edition, of, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, volume, 20, 1953, was, unequivocally, critical, of, atat, rk, s, policies, in, the, last, years, of, his, rule, calling, his, domestic, policies, anti, popular, and, his, foreign, course, as, aimed, at, rapprochement, with, the, imperialist, powers, the, post, war, leader, of, greece, eleftherios, venizelos, was, also, determined, to, establish, normal, relations, between, his, country, and, turkey, the, war, had,

rk, resisted, the, pressures, of, historic, enmities, and, was, sensitive, towards, past, tensions, at, one, point, he, ordered, the, removal, of, a, painting, showing, a, turkish, soldier, plunging, his, bayonet, into, a, greek, soldier, by, stating, what, a, revolting, scene, greece, renounced, all, its, claims, over, turkish, territory, and, the, two, sides, concluded, an, agreement, on, 30,

comprehensive, agreement, called, the, entente, cordiale, between, greece, and, turkey, which, was, a, stepping, stone, for, the, balkan, pact, greek, premier, ioannis, metaxas, once, stated, with, regard, to, atat, rk, that, greece, which, has, the, highest, estimation, of, the, renowned, leader, heroic, soldier, and, enlightened, creator, of, turkey, we, will, never, forget, that, president, atat, rk, was, the, true, founder, of, the, turkish, greek, alliance, based, on, a, framework, of, common, ideals, and, peaceful, cooperation, he, developed, ties, of, friendship, between, the, two, nations, which, it, would, be, unthinkable, to, dissolve, greece, will, guard, its, fervent, memories, of, this, great, man, who, determined, an, unalterable, future, path, for, the, noble, turkish,

messages, of, friendship, to, each, other, during, the, turkish, war, of, independence, the, policy, of, the, ankara, government, in, this, period, was, to, give, moral, support, in, order, to,

politics, atat, rk, demanded, that, the, members, of, the, turkish, foreign, office, devise, a, solution, that, would, transfer, full, control, of, the, waterway, to, turkey, on, 20, july, 1936, the, montreux, convention, was, signed, by, bulgaria, great, britain, australia, france, japan, romania, the, soviet, union, turkey, yugoslavia, and, greece, it, became, the, primary, instrument, governing, the, passage, of, commercial, and, war, vessels, through, the, dardanelles, strait, the, agreement, was, ratified, by, the, gnat, on, 31, july, 1936, and, went, into, effect, on, 9, november, 1936, until, the, early, 1930s, turkey, followed, a, neutral, foreign, policy, with, the, west, by, developing, joint, friendship, and, neutrality, agreements, these, bilateral, agreements, aligned, with, atat, rk, s, worldview, by, the, end, of, 1925, turkey, had, signed, fifteen, joint, agreements, with, western, states, in, the, early, 1930s, changes, and, developments, in, world, politics, required, turkey, to, make, multilateral, agreements, to, improve, its, security, atat, rk, strongly, believed, that, close, cooperation, between, the, balkan, states, based, on, the, principle, of, equality, would, have, an, important, effect, on, european, politics, these, states, had, been, ruled, by, the, ottoman, empire, for, centuries, and, had, proved, to, be, a, powerful, force, while, the, origins, of, the, balkan, agreement, may, date, as, far, back, as, 1925, the, balkan, pact, came, into, being, in, the, mid, 1930s, several, important, developments, in, europe, helped, the, original, idea, materialise, such, as, improvements, in, the, turkish, greek, alliance, and, the, rapprochement, between, bulgaria, and, yugoslavia, the, most, important, factor, in, driving, turkish, foreign, policy, from, the, mid, 1930s, onwards, was, the, fear, of, italy, benito, mussolini, had, frequently, proclaimed, his, intention, to, place, the, entire, mediterranean, under, italian, control, both, the, turks, and, the, various, balkan, states, felt, threatened, by, italian, ambitions, the, balkan, pact, was, negotiated, by, atat, rk, with, greece, romania, and, yugoslavia, this, mutual, defence, agreement, intended, to, guarantee, the, signatories, territorial, integrity, and, political, independence, against, attack, from, another, balkan, state, such, as, bulgaria, or, albania, it, countered, the, increasingly, aggressive, foreign, policy, of, fascist, italy, and, the, effect, of, a, potential, bulgarian, alignment, with, nazi, germany, atat, rk, thought, of, the, balkan, pact, as, a, medium, of, balance, in, turkey, s, relations, with, the, european, countries, he, was, particularly, anxious, to, establish, a, region, of, security, and, alliances, to, the, west, of, turkey, in, europe, which, the, balkan, pact, helped, achieve, the, balkan, pact, provided, for, regular, military, and, diplomatic, consultations, the, importance, of, the, agreement, is, best, seen, in, a, message, atat, rk, sent, to, the, greek, premier, ioannis, metaxas, the, borders, of, the, allies, in, the, balkan, pact, are, a, single, border, those, who, covet, this, border, will, encounter, the, burning, beams, of, the, sun, i, recommend, avoiding, this, the, forces, that, defend, our, borders, are, a, single, and, inseparable, force, the, balkan, pact, was, signed, by, the, gna, on, 28, february, the, greek, and, yugoslav, parliaments, ratified, the, agreement, a, few, days, later, the, unanimously, ratified, balkan, pact, was, formally, adopted, on, 18, may, 1935, and, lasted, until, 1940, the, balkan, pact, turned, out, to, be, ineffective, for, reasons, that, were, beyond, atat, rk, s, control, the, pact, failed, when, bulgaria, attempted, to, raise, the, dobruja, issue, only, to, end, with, the, italian, invasion, of, albania, on, 7, april, 1939, these, conflicts, spread, rapidly, eventually, triggering, world, war, ii, the, goal, of, atat, rk, to, protect, southeast, europe, failed, with, the, dissolution, of, the, pact, in, 1938, the, turkish, army, at, peacetime, strength, consisted, of, 174, 000, soldiers, and, 20, 000, officers, forming, 11, army, corps, 23, divisions, one, armoured, brigade, 3, cavalry, brigades, and, 7, frontier, commands, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1930s, atat, rk, tried, to, form, a, closer, relationship, with, britain, the, risks, of, this, policy, change, put, the, two, men, at, odds, the, hatay, issue, and, the, lyon, agreement, were, two, important, developments, in, foreign, policy, that, played, a, significant, role, in, severing, relations, between, atat, rk, and, n, n, in, 1936, atat, rk, raised, the, issue, of, hatay, at, the, league, of, nations, hatay, was, based, on, the, old, administrative, unit, of, the, ottoman, empire, called, the, sanjak, of, alexandretta, on, behalf, of, the, league, of, nations, the, representatives, of, france, the, united, kingdom, the, netherlands, belgium, and, turkey, prepared, a, constitution, for, hatay, which, established, it, as, an, autonomous, sanjak, within, syria, despite, some, inter, ethnic, violence, an, election, was, conducted, in, 1938, by, the, local, legislative, assembly, the, cities, of, antakya, antioch, and, skenderun, alexandretta, joined, turkey, in, 1939, atat, rk, instigated, economic, policies, to, develop, small, and, large, scale, businesses, but, also, to, create, social, strata, i, e, industrial, bourgeoisie, coexisting, with, the, peasantry, of, anatolia, that, were, virtually, non, existent, during, the, ottoman, empire, the, primary, problem, faced, by, the, politics, of, his, period, was, the, lag, in, the, development, of, political, institutions, and, social, classes, which, would, steer, such, social, and, economic, changes, atat, rk, s, vision, regarding, early, turkish, economic, policy, was, apparent, during, the, zmir, economic, congress, of, 1923, the, initial, choices, of, atat, rk, s, economic, policies, reflected, the, realities, of, his, time, after, world, war, i, due, to, the, lack, of, any, real, potential, investors, to, fund, private, sector, industry, atat, rk, established, many, state, owned, factories, for, agriculture, machinery, and, textile, industries, atat, rk, and, smet, n, n, s, pursuit, of, state, controlled, economic, policies, was, guided, by, a, national, vision, their, goal, was, to, knit, the, country, together, eliminate, foreign, control, of, the, economy, and, improve, communications, within, turkey, resources, were, channeled, away, from, istanbul, a, trading, port, with, international, foreign, enterprises, in, favor, of, other, less, developed, cities, in, order, to, achieve, a, more, balanced, economic, development, throughout, the, country, for, atat, rk, and, his, supporters, tobacco, remained, wedded, to, his, pursuit, of, economic, independence, turkish, tobacco, was, an, important, industrial, crop, but, its, cultivation, and, manufacture, had, been, under, french, monopolies, granted, by, capitulations, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, tobacco, and, cigarette, trade, was, controlled, by, two, french, companies, the, regie, company, and, narquileh, tobacco, the, ottoman, empire, had, given, the, tobacco, monopoly, to, the, ottoman, bank, as, a, limited, company, under, the, council, of, the, public, debt, regie, as, part, of, the, council, had, control, over, tobacco, production, storage, and, distribution, including, export, with, unchallenged, price, control, consequently, turkish, farmers, were, dependent, on, the, company, for, their, livelihoods, in, 1925, regie, was, taken, over, by, the, state, and, named, tekel, government, control, of, tobacco, was, one, of, the, greatest, achievements, of, the, kemalist, political, machinery, s, nationalization, of, the, economy, for, a, country, that, did, not, produce, oil, kemalists, accompanied, this, achievement, with, the, development, of, the, country, s, cotton, industry, which, peaked, during, the, early, 1930s, cotton, was, the, second, most, important, industrial, crop, in, turkey, at, the, time, in, 1924, with, the, initiative, of, atat, rk, the, first, turkish, bank, bankas, was, established, with, atat, rk, as, the, bank, s, first, member, the, bank, s, creation, was, a, response, to, the, growing, need, for, a, truly, national, establishment, and, a, banking, system, which, was, capable, of, backing, up, economic, activities, managing, funds, accumulated, through, policies, of, savings, incentives, and, offering, resources, where, necessary, to, trigger, industrial, impetus, in, 1927, turkish, state, railways, was, established, because, atat, rk, considered, the, development, of, a, national, rail, network, as, another, important, step, in, industrialisation, railways, were, given, high, priority, the, turkish, state, railway, developed, an, extensive,
