training, had, begun, a, year, previously, under, his, father, who, had, found, his, son, studious, grave, and, prudent, beyond, his, years, and, having, decided, to, train, and, initiate, him, in, the, government, of, the, spanish, kingdoms, the, king, emperor, s, interactions, with, his, son, during, his, stay, in, castile, convinced, him, of, philip, s, precocity, in, statesmanship, so, he, determined, to, leave, in, his, hands, the, regency, of, the, spanish, kingdoms, in, 1543, philip, who, had, previously, been, made, the, duke, of, milan, in, 1540, began, governing, the, most, extensive, empire, in, the, world, at, the, young, age, of, sixteen, charles, left, philip, with, experienced, advisors, notably, the, secretary, francisco, de, los, cobos, and, the, general, the, duke, of, alba, philip, was, also, left, with, extensive, written, instructions, that, emphasised, piety, patience, modesty, and, distrust, these, principles, of, charles, were, gradually, assimilated, by, his, son, who, would, grow, up, to, become, grave, self, possessed, and, cautious, personally, philip, spoke, softly, and, had, an, icy, self, mastery, in, the, words, of, one, of, his, ministers, he, had, a, smile, that, was, cut, by, a, sword, after, living, in, the, netherlands, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, philip, ii, decided, to, return, to, castile, although, sometimes, described, as, an, absolute, monarch, philip, faced, many, constitutional, constraints, on, his, authority, influenced, by, the, growing, strength, of, the, bureaucracy, the, spanish, empire, was, not, a, single, monarchy, with, one, legal, system, but, a, personal, union, of, separate, realms, each, jealously, guarding, its, own, rights, against, those, of, the, house, of, habsburg, in, practice, philip, often, found, his, authority, overruled, by, local, assemblies, and, his, word, less, effective, than, that, of, local, lords, philip, carried, several, titles, as, heir, to, the, spanish, kingdoms, and, empire, including, prince, of, asturias, the, newest, constituent, kingdom, in, the, empire, was, navarre, a, realm, invaded, by, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, mainly, with, castilian, troops, 1512, and, annexed, to, castile, with, an, ambiguous, status, 1513, war, across, navarre, continued, until, 1528, treaties, of, madrid, and, cambrai, charles, v, proposed, to, end, hostilities, with, king, henry, ii, of, navarre, the, legitimate, monarch, of, navarre, by, marrying, his, son, philip, to, the, heiress, of, navarre, jeanne, iii, of, navarre, the, marriage, would, provide, a, dynastic, solution, to, instability, in, navarre, making, him, king, of, all, navarre, and, a, prince, of, independent, b, arn, as, well, as, lord, of, a, large, part, of, southern, france, however, the, french, nobility, under, francis, i, opposed, the, arrangement, and, successfully, ended, the, prospects, of, marriage, between, the, heirs, of, habsburg, and, albret, in, 1541, in, his, will, charles, stated, his, doubts, over, navarre, and, recommended, that, his, son, give, the, kingdom, back, both, king, charles, and, his, son, philip, ii, failed, to, abide, by, the, elective, contractual, nature, of, the, crown, of, navarre, and, took, the, kingdom, for, granted, this, sparked, mounting, tension, not, only, with, king, henry, ii, and, queen, jeanne, iii, of, navarre, but, also, with, the, parliament, of, the, spanish, navarre, cortes, the, three, states, and, the, diputaci, n, for, breach, of, the, realm, specific, laws, fueros, violation, of, the, pactum, subjection, is, as, ratified, by, ferdinand, tensions, in, navarre, came, to, a, head, in, 1592, after, several, years, of, disagreements, over, the, agenda, of, the, intended, parliamentary, session, in, november, 1592, the, parliament, cortes, of, arag, n, revolted, against, another, breach, of, the, realm, specific, laws, so, the, attorney, general, justicia, of, the, kingdom, juan, de, lanuza, was, executed, on, philip, ii, s, orders, with, his, secretary, antonio, p, rez, taking, exile, in, france, in, navarre, the, major, strongholds, of, the, kingdom, were, garrisoned, by, troops, alien, to, the, kingdom, castilians, in, a, conspicuous, violation, of, the, local, laws, and, the, parliament, had, long, been, refusing, to, pledge, loyalty, to, philip, ii, s, son, and, heir, apparent, without, a, proper, ceremony, on, 20, november, 1592, a, ghostly, parliament, session, was, called, pushed, by, philip, ii, who, had, arrived, in, pamplona, at, the, head, of, an, unspecified, military, force, and, with, one, only, point, on, his, agenda, attendance, to, the, session, was, kept, blank, on, the, minutes, unlawful, appointments, of, trusted, castilian, officials, and, imposition, of, his, son, as, the, future, king, of, navarre, at, the, santa, maria, cathedral, a, ceremony, was, held, before, the, bishop, of, pamplona, 22, november, but, its, customary, procedure, and, terms, were, altered, protests, erupted, in, pamplona, but, they, were, quelled, philip, ii, also, grappled, with, the, problem, of, the, large, morisco, population, in, the, spanish, kingdoms, who, had, been, forcibly, converted, to, christianity, by, his, predecessors, in, 1569, the, morisco, revolt, broke, out, in, the, southern, kingdom, of, granada, in, defiance, of, attempts, to, suppress, moorish, customs, philip, ordered, the, expulsion, of, the, moriscos, from, granada, and, their, dispersal, to, other, provinces, despite, its, immense, dominions, the, spanish, kingdoms, had, a, sparse, population, that, yielded, a, limited, income, to, the, crown, in, contrast, to, france, for, example, which, was, much, more, heavily, populated, philip, faced, major, difficulties, in, raising, taxes, and, the, collection, was, largely, farmed, out, to, local, lords, he, was, able, to, finance, his, military, campaigns, only, by, taxing, and, exploiting, the, local, resources, of, his, empire, the, flow, of, income, from, the, new, world, proved, vital, to, his, militant, foreign, policy, but, his, exchequer, several, times, faced, bankruptcy, spanish, culture, flourished, during, philip, s, reign, beginning, the, spanish, golden, age, creating, a, lasting, legacy, in, literature, music, and, the, visual, arts, one, of, the, notable, artists, from, philip, ii, s, court, was, sofonisba, anguissola, who, gained, fame, for, her, talent, and, unusual, role, as, a, woman, artist, charles, v, had, left, his, son, philip, with, a, debt, of, about, 36, million, ducats, and, an, annual, deficit, of, 1, million, ducats, this, debt, caused, philip, ii, to, default, on, loans, in, 1557, 1560, 1575, and, 1596, including, debt, to, poland, known, as, neapolitan, sums, lenders, had, no, power, over, the, king, and, could, not, force, him, to, repay, his, loans, these, defaults, were, just, the, beginning, of, spain, s, economic, troubles, as, its, kings, would, default, six, more, times, in, the, next, 65, years, aside, from, reducing, state, revenues, for, overseas, expeditions, the, domestic, policies, of, philip, ii, further, burdened, the, spanish, kingdoms, and, would, in, the, following, century, contribute, to, its, decline, as, maintained, by, some, historians, the, spanish, kingdoms, were, subject, to, different, assemblies, the, cortes, in, castile, the, assembly, in, navarre, and, one, each, for, the, four, kingdoms, of, aragon, which, preserved, traditional, rights, and, laws, from, the, time, when, they, were, separate, kingdoms, this, made, the, spanish, kingdoms, and, its, possessions, difficult, to, rule, unlike, france, which, while, divided, into, regional, states, had, a, single, estates, general, the, lack, of, a, viable, supreme, assembly, led, to, power, defaulting, into, philip, ii, s, hands, especially, as, manager, and, final, arbiter, of, the, constant, conflict, between, different, authorities, to, deal, with, the, difficulties, arising, from, this, situation, authority, was, administered, by, local, agents, appointed, by, the, crown, and, viceroys, carrying, out, crown, instructions, philip, ii, felt, it, necessary, to, be, involved, in, the, detail, and, he, presided, over, specialised, councils, for, state, affairs, finance, war, and, the, inquisition, philip, ii, played, groups, against, each, other, leading, to, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, that, managed, affairs, inefficiently, even, to, the, extent, of, damaging, state, business, as, in, the, perez, affair, following, a, fire, in, valladolid, in, 1561, he, resisted, calls, to, move, his, court, to, lisbon, an, act, that, could, have, curbed, centralisation, and, bureaucracy, domestically, as, well, as, relaxed, rule, in, the, empire, as, a, whole, instead, with, the, traditional, royal, and, primacy, seat, of, toledo, now, essentially, obsolete, he, moved, his, court, to, the, castilian, stronghold, of, madrid, except, for, a, brief, period, under, philip, iii, of, spain, madrid, has, remained, the, capital, of, spain, it, was, around, this, time, that, philip, ii, converted, the, royal, alc, zar, of, madrid, into, a, royal, palace, the, works, which, lasted, from, 1561, until, 1598, were, done, by, tradesmen, who, came, from, the, netherlands, italy, and, france, king, philip, ii, ruled, at, a, critical, turning, point, in, european, history, toward, modernity, whereas, his, father, charles, v, had, been, forced, to, an, itinerant, rule, as, a, medieval, king, he, mainly, directed, state, affairs, even, when, not, at, court, indeed, when, his, health, began, failing, he, worked, from, his, quarters, at, the, palace, monastery, pantheon, of, el, escorial, that, he, had, built, in, 1584, a, palace, built, as, a, monument, to, spain, s, role, as, a, center, of, the, christian, world, but, philip, did, not, enjoy, the, supremacy, that, king, louis, xiv, of, france, would, in, the, next, century, nor, was, such, a, rule, necessarily, possible, at, his, time, the, inefficiencies, of, the, spanish, state, and, the, restrictively, regulated, industry, under, his, rule, were, common, to, many, contemporary, countries, further, the, dispersal, of, the, moriscos, from, granada, motivated, by, the, fear, they, might, support, a, muslim, invasion, had, serious, negative, effects, on, the, economy, particularly, in, that, region, philip, s, foreign, policies, were, determined, by, a, combination, of, catholic, fervour, and, dynastic, objectives, he, considered, himself, the, chief, defender, of, catholic, europe, both, against, the, ottoman, empire, and, against, the, forces, of, the, protestant, reformation, he, never, relented, from, his, fight, against, heresy, defending, the, catholic, faith, and, limiting, freedom, of, worship, within, his, territories, these, territories, included, his, patrimony, in, the, netherlands, where, protestantism, had, taken, deep, root, following, the, revolt, of, the, netherlands, in, 1568, philip, waged, a, campaign, against, dutch, heresy, and, secession, it, also, dragged, in, the, english, and, the, french, at, times, and, expanded, into, the, german, rhineland, with, the, cologne, war, this, series, of, conflicts, lasted, for, the, rest, of, his, life, philip, s, constant, involvement, and, focus, in, european, wars, took, a, significant, toll, on, the, treasury, and, caused, economic, difficulties, for, the, crown, and, even, bankruptcies, in, 1588, the, english, defeated, philip, s, spanish, armada, thwarting, his, planned, invasion, of, the, country, to, reinstate, catholicism, but, war, with, england, continued, for, the, next, sixteen, years, in, a, complex, series, of, struggles, that, included, france, ireland, and, the, main, battle, zone, the, low, countries, it, would, not, end, until, all, the, leading, protagonists, including, himself, had, died, earlier, however, after, several, setbacks, in, his, reign, and, especially, that, of, his, father, philip, did, achieve, a, decisive, victory, against, the, turks, at, lepanto, in, 1571, with, the, allied, fleet, of, the, holy, league, which, he, had, put, under, the, command, of, his, illegitimate, brother, john, of, austria, he, also, successfully, secured, his, succession, to, the, throne, of, portugal, the, administration, of, overseas, conquests, was, reformed, extensive, questionnaires, were, distributed, to, every, major, town, and, region, in, new, spain, called, relaciones, geogr, ficas, these, surveys, helped, the, spanish, monarchy, to, govern, philip, s, overseas, possessions, more, effectively, charles, v, abdicated, the, throne, of, naples, to, philip, on, 25, july, 1554, and, the, young, king, was, invested, with, the, kingdom, officially, a, papal, fief, on, 2, october, by, pope, julius, iii, the, date, of, charles, abdication, of, the, throne, of, sicily, is, uncertain, but, philip, was, invested, with, this, kingdom, on, 18, november, 1554, by, julius, in, 1556, philip, decided, to, invade, the, papal, states, and, temporarily, held, territory, there, perhaps, in, response, to, pope, paul, iv, s, anti, spanish, outlook, according, to, philip, ii, he, was, doing, it, for, the, benefit, of, the, church, in, a, letter, to, the, princess, dowager, of, portugal, regent, of, the, spanish, kingdoms, dated, 22, september, 1556, francisco, de, vargas, wrote, i, have, reported, to, your, highness, what, has, been, happening, here, and, how, far, the, pope, is, going, in, his, fury, and, vain, imaginings, his, majesty, could, not, do, otherwise, than, have, a, care, for, his, reputation, and, dominions, i, am, sure, your, highness, will, have, had, more, recent, news, from, the, duke, of, alva, who, has, taken, the, field, with, an, excellent, army, and, has, penetrated, so, far, into, the, pope, s, territory, that, his, cavalry, is, raiding, up, to, ten, miles, from, rome, where, there, is, such, panic, that, the, population, would, have, run, away, had, not, the, gates, been, closed, the, pope, has, fallen, ill, with, rage, and, was, struggling, with, a, fever, on, the, 16th, of, this, month, the, two, carafa, brothers, the, cardinal, and, count, montorio, do, not, agree, and, they, and, piero, strozzi, are, not, on, as, good, terms, as, they, were, in, the, past, they, would, like, to, discuss, peace, the, best, thing, would, be, for, the, pope, to, die, for, he, is, the, poison, at, the, root, of, all, this, trouble, and, more, which, may, occur, his, majesty, s, intention, is, only, to, wrest, the, knife, from, this, madman, s, hand, and, make, him, return, to, a, sense, of, his, dignity, acting, like, the, protector, of, the, apostolic, see, in, whose, name, and, that, of, the, college, of, cardinals, his, majesty, has, publicly, proclaimed, that, he, has, seized, all, he, is, occupying, the, pope, is, now, sending, again, to, the, potentates, of, italy, for, help, i, hope, he, will, gain, as, little, thereby, as, he, has, done, in, the, past, and, that, the, french, will, calm, down, may, god, give, us, peace, in, the, end, as, their, majesties, desire, and, deserve, in, response, to, the, invasion, pope, paul, iv, called, for, a, french, military, intervention, after, minor, fights, in, lazio, and, near, rome, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, viceroy, of, naples, met, cardinal, carlo, carafa, and, signed, the, treaty, of, cave, as, a, compromise, french, and, spanish, forces, left, the, papal, states, and, the, pope, declared, a, neutral, position, between, france, and, the, spanish, kingdoms, philip, led, the, spanish, kingdoms, into, the, final, phase, of, the, italian, wars, a, spanish, advance, into, france, from, the, low, countries, led, to, their, important, victory, at, the, battle, of, st, quentin, 1557, the, french, were, defeated, again, at, the, battle, of, gravelines, 1558, the, resulting, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, in, 1559, secured, piedmont, to, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, corsica, to, the, republic, of, genoa, both, genoa, and, savoy, were, allies, of, spain, and, although, savoy, subsequently, declared, its, neutrality, between, france, and, spain, genoa, remained, a, crucial, financial, ally, for, philip, during, his, entire, reign, the, treaty, also, confirmed, philip, s, control, over, milan, naples, sicily, and, sardinia, therefore, all, of, southern, italy, was, under, spanish, rule, as, part, of, the, crown, of, aragon, in, the, north, milan, was, a, duchy, of, the, holy, roman, empire, held, by, philip, attached, to, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, state, of, presidi, in, tuscany, gave, philip, the, possibility, to, monitor, maritime, traffic, to, southern, italy, whilst, the, grant, of, the, duchy, of, siena, to, the, new, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, ensured, it, would, remain, a, spanish, ally, the, council, of, italy, was, set, up, by, philip, in, order, to, co, ordinate, his, rule, over, the, states, of, milan, naples, and, sicily, ultimately, the, treaty, ended, the, 60, year, franco, habsburg, wars, for, supremacy, in, italy, it, marked, also, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, peace, between, the, pope, and, philip, as, their, european, interests, converged, although, political, differences, remained, and, diplomatic, contrasts, eventually, re, emerged, by, the, end, of, the, wars, in, 1559, habsburg, spain, had, been, established, as, the, premier, power, of, europe, to, the, detriment, of, france, in, france, henry, ii, was, fatally, wounded, in, a, joust, held, during, the, celebrations, of, the, peace, his, death, led, to, the, accession, of, his, 15, year, old, son, francis, ii, who, in, turn, soon, died, the, french, monarchy, was, thrown, into, turmoil, which, increased, further, with, the, outbreak, of, the, french, wars, of, religion, that, would, last, for, several, decades, the, states, of, italy, were, reduced, to, second, rate, powers, with, spain, dominating, the, peninsula, mary, tudor, s, death, in, 1558, enabled, philip, to, seal, the, treaty, by, marrying, henry, ii, s, daughter, elisabeth, of, valois, later, giving, him, a, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, on, behalf, of, his, daughter, by, elisabeth, isabella, clara, eugenia, the, french, wars, of, religion, 1562, 1598, were, primarily, fought, between, french, catholics, and, protestants, huguenots, the, conflict, involved, the, factional, disputes, between, the, aristocratic, houses, of, france, such, as, the, house, of, bourbon, and, house, of, guise, and, both, sides, received, assistance, from, foreign, sources, philip, claimed, descent, from, constantine, i, and, charlemagne, justifying, his, intervention, in, french, wars, of, religion, and, his, continuing, efforts, to, depose, henry, iv, of, france, philip, signed, the, treaty, of, vaucelles, with, henry, ii, of, france, in, 1556, based, on, the, terms, of, the, treaty, the, territory, of, franche, comt, in, burgundy, was, to, be, relinquished, to, philip, however, the, treaty, was, broken, shortly, afterwards, france, and, the, spanish, kingdoms, waged, war, in, northern, france, and, italy, over, the, following, years, spanish, victories, at, st, quentin, and, gravelines, led, to, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, in, which, france, recognised, spanish, sovereignty, over, franche, comt, during, the, war, of, the, portuguese, succession, the, pretender, ant, nio, fled, to, france, following, his, defeats, and, as, philip, s, armies, had, not, yet, occupied, the, azores, he, sailed, there, with, a, large, anglo, french, fleet, under, filippo, strozzi, a, florentine, exile, in, the, service, of, france, the, naval, battle, of, terceira, took, place, on, 26, july, 1582, in, the, sea, near, the, azores, off, s, o, miguel, island, as, part, of, the, war, of, the, portuguese, succession, and, the, anglo, spanish, war, 1585, 1604, the, spanish, navy, defeated, the, combined, anglo, french, fleet, that, had, sailed, to, preserve, control, of, the, azores, under, ant, nio, the, french, naval, contingent, was, the, largest, french, force, sent, overseas, before, the, age, of, louis, xiv, the, spanish, victory, at, terceira, was, followed, by, the, battle, of, the, azores, between, the, portuguese, loyal, to, the, claimant, ant, nio, supported, by, french, and, english, troops, and, the, spanish, portuguese, forces, loyal, to, philip, commanded, by, the, admiral, don, lvaro, de, baz, n, victory, in, azores, completed, the, incorporation, of, portugal, into, the, spanish, empire, philip, financed, the, catholic, league, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, he, directly, intervened, in, the, final, phases, of, the, wars, 1589, 1598, ordering, alexander, farnese, duke, of, parma, into, france, in, an, effort, to, unseat, henry, iv, and, perhaps, dreaming, of, placing, his, favourite, daughter, isabella, clara, eugenia, on, the, french, throne, elisabeth, of, valois, philip, s, third, wife, and, isabella, s, mother, had, already, ceded, any, claim, to, the, french, crown, with, her, marriage, to, philip, and, in, france, the, salic, law, remained, in, effect, however, the, parlement, of, paris, in, power, of, the, catholic, party, gave, verdict, that, isabella, clara, eugenia, was, the, legitimate, sovereign, of, france, philip, s, interventions, in, the, fighting, sending, the, duke, of, parma, to, end, henry, iv, s, siege, of, paris, in, 1590, and, the, siege, of, rouen, in, 1592, contributed, in, saving, the, french, catholic, leagues, s, cause, against, a, protestant, monarchy, in, 1593, henry, agreed, to, convert, to, catholicism, weary, of, war, most, french, catholics, switched, to, his, side, against, the, hardline, core, of, the, catholic, league, who, were, portrayed, by, henry, s, propagandists, as, puppets, of, a, foreign, monarch, philip, by, the, end, of, 1594, certain, league, members, were, still, working, against, henry, across, the, country, but, all, relied, on, the, support, of, the, spanish, crown, in, january, 1595, therefore, henry, officially, declared, war, on, the, spanish, crown, to, show, catholics, that, philip, was, using, religion, as, a, cover, for, an, attack, on, the, french, state, and, protestants, that, he, had, not, become, a, puppet, of, the, spanish, crown, through, his, conversion, while, hoping, to, reconquer, large, parts, of, northern, france, from, the, franco, spanish, catholic, forces, french, victory, at, the, battle, of, fontaine, fran, aise, in, burgundy, 5, june, 1595, marked, an, end, to, the, catholic, league, in, france, the, french, also, made, some, progress, during, an, invasion, of, the, spanish, netherlands, they, captured, ham, and, massacred, the, small, spanish, garrison, provoking, anger, among, the, spanish, ranks, the, spanish, launched, a, concerted, offensive, that, year, taking, doullens, cambrai, and, le, catelet, at, doullens, they, massacred, 4, 000, of, its, citizens, on, 24, april, 1596, the, spanish, also, conquered, calais, following, the, spanish, capture, of, amiens, in, march, 1597, the, french, crown, laid, siege, to, it, until, it, managed, to, reconquer, amiens, from, the, overstretched, spanish, forces, in, september, 1597, henry, then, negotiated, a, peace, with, the, spanish, crown, the, war, was, only, drawn, to, an, official, close, however, with, the, peace, of, vervins, in, may, 1598, the, 1598, treaty, of, vervins, was, largely, a, restatement, of, the, 1559, peace, of, c, teau, cambr, sis, and, spanish, forces, and, subsidies, were, withdrawn, meanwhile, henry, issued, the, edict, of, nantes, which, offered, a, high, degree, of, religious, toleration, for, french, protestants, the, military, interventions, in, france, thus, failed, to, oust, henry, from, the, throne, or, suppress, protestantism, in, france, and, yet, they, had, played, a, decisive, part, in, helping, the, french, catholic, cause, gain, the, conversion, of, henry, ensuring, that, catholicism, would, remain, france, s, official, and, majority, faith, matters, of, paramount, importance, for, the, devoutly, catholic, spanish, king, in, the, early, part, of, his, reign, philip, was, concerned, with, the, rising, power, of, the, ottoman, empire, under, suleiman, the, magnificent, fear, of, islamic, domination, in, the, mediterranean, caused, him, to, pursue, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, in, 1558, turkish, admiral, piyale, pasha, captured, the, balearic, islands, especially, inflicting, great, damage, on, menorca, and, enslaving, many, while, raiding, the, coasts, of, the, spanish, mainland, philip, appealed, to, the, pope, and, other, powers, in, europe, to, bring, an, end, to, the, rising, ottoman, threat, since, his, father, s, losses, against, the, ottomans, and, against, hayreddin, barbarossa, in, 1541, the, major, european, sea, powers, in, the, mediterranean, namely, the, spanish, crown, and, venice, became, hesitant, in, confronting, the, ottomans, the, myth, of, turkish, invincibility, was, becoming, a, popular, story, causing, fear, and, panic, among, the, people, in, 1560, philip, ii, organised, a, holy, league, between, the, spanish, kingdoms, and, the, republic, of, venice, the, republic, of, genoa, the, papal, states, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, the, knights, of, malta, the, joint, fleet, was, assembled, at, messina, and, consisted, of, 200, ships, 60, galleys, and, 140, other, vessels, carrying, a, total, of, 30, 000, soldiers, under, the, command, of, giovanni, andrea, doria, nephew, of, the, famous, genoese, admiral, andrea, doria, on, 12, march, 1560, the, holy, league, captured, the, island, of, djerba, which, had, a, strategic, location, and, could, control, the, sea, routes, between, algiers, and, tripoli, as, a, response, suleiman, sent, an, ottoman, fleet, of, 120, ships, under, the, command, of, piyale, pasha, which, arrived, at, djerba, on, 9, may, 1560, the, battle, lasted, until, 14, may, 1560, and, the, forces, of, piyale, pasha, and, turgut, reis, who, joined, piyale, pasha, on, the, third, day, of, the, battle, won, an, overwhelming, victory, at, the, battle, of, djerba, the, holy, league, lost, 60, ships, 30, galleys, and, 20, 000, men, and, giovanni, andrea, doria, was, barely, able, to, escape, with, a, small, vessel, the, ottomans, retook, the, fortress, of, djerba, whose, spanish, commander, d, lvaro, de, sande, attempted, to, escape, with, a, ship, but, was, followed, and, eventually, captured, by, turgut, reis, in, 1563, capitalizing, on, the, political, climate, the, regency, of, algiers, launched, the, sieges, of, oran, and, mers, el, k, bir, in, a, large, scale, attempt, to, dislodge, the, major, spanish, positions, in, northern, africa, but, the, attempt, met, failure, philip, s, navy, then, conquered, pe, n, de, v, lez, de, la, gomera, the, following, year, the, ottomans, sent, a, large, expedition, to, malta, which, laid, siege, to, several, forts, on, the, island, and, took, some, of, them, but, the, spanish, sent, a, relief, force, under, d, garc, a, de, toledo, and, a, rescued, lvaro, de, sande, which, finally, drove, the, ottoman, army, out, of, the, island, the, grave, threat, posed, by, the, increasing, ottoman, domination, of, the, mediterranean, was, finally, reversed, in, one, of, history, s, most, decisive, battles, with, the, destruction, of, nearly, the, entire, ottoman, fleet, at, the, battle, of, lepanto, in, 1571, by, the, holy, league, under, the, command, of, philip, s, half, brother, don, john, of, austria, and, don, lvaro, de, baz, n, a, fleet, sent, by, philip, again, commanded, by, don, john, reconquered, tunis, from, the, ottomans, in, 1573, the, turks, soon, rebuilt, their, fleet, and, in, 1574, ulu, ali, reis, managed, to, recapture, tunis, with, a, force, of, 250, galleys, and, a, siege, that, lasted, 40, days, thousands, of, spanish, and, italian, soldiers, became, prisoners, nevertheless, lepanto, marked, a, permanent, reversal, in, the, balance, of, naval, power, in, the, mediterranean, and, the, end, of, the, threat, of, ottoman, control, in, 1585, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, with, the, ottomans, during, philip, s, reign, spain, considered, the, pacific, ocean, a, mare, clausum, a, sea, closed, to, other, naval, powers, as, the, only, known, entrance, from, the, atlantic, the, strait, of, magellan, was, at, times, patrolled, by, fleets, sent, to, prevent, entrance, of, non, spanish, ships, to, end, navigation, by, rival, powers, in, the, strait, of, magellan, spanish, viceroy, francisco, de, toledo, ordered, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, to, explore, the, strait, and, found, settlements, on, its, shores, in, 1584, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, founded, two, colonies, in, the, strait, nombre, de, jes, s, and, ciudad, del, rey, don, felipe, the, latter, was, established, north, of, the, strait, with, 300, settlers, the, new, colonies, suffered, from, high, death, rates, likely, as, a, consequence, of, executions, brawls, violent, encounters, with, indigenous, peoples, and, diseases, which, were, rife, a, contributing, cause, for, failure, of, the, settlement, may, have, been, poor, morale, an, issue, that, plagued, the, venture, almost, from, the, beginning, this, can, in, part, be, explained, by, a, series, of, difficulties, the, expedition, had, to, go, through, between, the, departure, from, spain, and, the, arrival, to, the, strait, philip, ii, s, inaction, despite, repeated, pleas, by, sarmiento, to, aid, the, ailing, colony, has, been, attributed, to, the, strain, on, spain, s, resources, that, resulted, from, wars, with, england, and, dutch, rebels, in, 1587, english, corsairs, renamed, ciudad, del, rey, don, felipe, puerto, del, hambre, or, port, famine, most, of, the, settlers, had, died, from, cold, or, starvation, when, sir, thomas, cavendish, landed, at, the, site, of, rey, don, felipe, in, 1587, he, found, only, ruins, of, the, settlement, the, spanish, failure, at, colonizing, the, strait, of, magellan, caused, chilo, archipelago, to, assume, the, role, of, protecting, western, patagonia, from, foreign, intrusions, valdivia, and, chilo, acted, as, sentries, being, hubs, where, the, spanish, collected, intelligence, from, all, over, patagonia, philip, s, rule, in, the, seventeen, provinces, known, collectively, as, the, netherlands, faced, many, difficulties, leading, to, open, warfare, in, 1568, he, appointed, his, half, sister, margaret, of, parma, as, governor, of, the, netherlands, when, he, left, the, low, countries, for, the, spanish, kingdoms, in, 1559, but, forced, her, to, adjust, policy, to, the, advice, of, cardinal, granvelle, who, was, greatly, disliked, in, the, netherlands, after, he, insisted, on, direct, control, over, events, in, the, netherlands, despite, being, over, two, weeks, ride, away, in, madrid, there, was, discontent, in, the, netherlands, about, philip, s, taxation, demands, and, the, incessant, persecution, of, protestants, in, 1566, protestant, preachers, sparked, anti, clerical, riots, known, as, the, iconoclast, fury, in, response, to, growing, protestant, influence, the, army, of, the, duke, of, alba, went, on, the, offensive, in, 1568, alba, had, lamoral, count, of, egmont, and, philip, de, montmorency, count, of, horn, executed, in, brussels, central, square, further, alienating, the, local, aristocracy, there, were, massacres, of, civilians, in, mechelen, naarden, zutphen, and, haarlem, in, 1571, alba, erected, at, antwerp, a, bronze, statue, of, himself, trampling, the, rebellious, dutch, under, his, horse, s, hooves, cast, from, the, melted, down, cannon, looted, by, the, spanish, troops, after, the, battle, of, jemmingen, in, 1568, it, was, modelled, on, medieval, images, of, the, spanish, patron, saint, james, the, moorslayer, riding, down, muslims, and, caused, such, outrage, that, philip, had, it, removed, and, destroyed, in, 1572, a, prominent, exiled, member, of, the, dutch, aristocracy, william, the, silent, prince, of, orange, invaded, the, netherlands, with, a, protestant, army, but, he, only, succeeded, in, holding, two, provinces, holland, and, zeeland, because, of, the, spanish, repulse, in, the, siege, of, alkmaar, 1573, led, by, his, equally, brutal, son, fadrique, alba, resigned, his, command, replaced, by, luis, de, requesens, y, z, iga, alba, boasted, that, he, had, burned, or, executed, 18, 600, persons, in, the, netherlands, in, addition, to, the, far, greater, number, he, massacred, during, the, war, many, of, them, women, and, children, 8, 000, persons, were, burned, or, hanged, in, one, year, and, the, total, number, of, alba, s, flemish, victims, can, not, have, fallen, short, of, 50, 000, under, requesens, the, army, of, flanders, reached, a, peak, strength, of, 86, 000, in, 1574, and, retained, its, battlefield, superiority, destroying, louis, of, nassau, s, german, mercenary, army, at, the, battle, of, mookerheyde, on, 14, april, 1574, killing, both, him, and, his, brother, henry, of, nassau, dillenburg, rampant, inflation, and, the, loss, of, treasure, fleets, from, the, new, world, prevented, philip, from, paying, his, soldiers, consistently, leading, to, the, so, called, spanish, fury, at, antwerp, in, 1576, where, soldiers, ran, amok, through, the, streets, burning, more, than, 1, 000, homes, and, killing, 6, 000, citizens, philip, sent, in, alexander, farnese, duke, of, parma, as, governor, general, of, the, spanish, netherlands, from, 1578, to, 1592, farnese, defeated, the, rebels, at, the, battle, of, gembloux, 1578, and, he, captured, many, rebel, towns, in, the, south, maastricht, 1579, tournai, 1581, oudenaarde, 1582, dunkirk, 1583, bruges, 1584, ghent, 1584, and, antwerp, 1585, the, states, general, of, the, northern, provinces, united, in, the, 1579, union, of, utrecht, passed, an, act, of, abjuration, in, 1581, declaring, that, they, no, longer, recognised, philip, as, their, king, the, southern, netherlands, what, is, now, belgium, and, luxembourg, remained, under, spanish, rule, in, 1584, william, the, silent, was, assassinated, by, balthasar, g, rard, after, philip, had, offered, a, reward, of, 25, 000, crowns, to, anyone, who, killed, him, calling, him, a, pest, on, the, whole, of, christianity, and, the, enemy, of, the, human, race, the, dutch, forces, continued, to, fight, on, under, orange, s, son, maurice, of, nassau, who, received, modest, help, from, the, queen, of, england, in, 1585, the, dutch, gained, an, advantage, over, the, spanish, because, of, their, growing, economic, strength, in, contrast, to, philip, s, burgeoning, economic, troubles, the, war, came, to, an, end, in, 1648, when, the, dutch, republic, was, recognised, by, the, spanish, crown, as, independent, the, eight, decades, of, war, came, at, a, massive, human, cost, with, an, estimated, 600, 000, to, 700, 000, victims, of, which, 350, 000, to, 400, 000, were, civilians, killed, by, disease, and, what, would, later, be, considered, war, crimes, in, 1578, young, king, sebastian, of, portugal, died, at, the, battle, of, alc, cer, quibir, without, descendants, triggering, a, succession, crisis, his, granduncle, the, elderly, cardinal, henry, succeeded, him, as, king, but, henry, had, no, descendants, either, having, taken, holy, orders, when, henry, died, two, years, after, sebastian, s, disappearance, three, grandchildren, of, manuel, i, claimed, the, throne, infanta, catarina, duchess, of, braganza, ant, nio, prior, of, crato, and, philip, ii, of, spain, ant, nio, was, acclaimed, king, of, portugal, in, many, cities, and, towns, throughout, the, country, but, members, of, the, council, of, governors, of, portugal, who, had, supported, philip, escaped, to, the, spanish, kingdoms, and, declared, him, to, be, the, legal, successor, of, henry, in, 1580, philip, ii, marched, into, portugal, and, defeated, prior, ant, nio, s, troops, in, the, battle, of, alc, ntara, the, portuguese, suffered, 4, 000, killed, wounded, or, captured, while, the, spanish, sustained, only, 500, casualties, the, troops, commanded, by, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, imposed, subjection, to, philip, before, entering, lisbon, where, he, seized, an, immense, treasure, philip, ii, of, spain, assumed, the, portuguese, throne, and, was, crowned, philip, i, of, portugal, on, 17, july, 1580, recognized, as, king, by, the, portuguese, cortes, of, tomar, and, a, near, sixty, year, personal, union, under, the, rule, of, the, philippine, dynasty, began, this, gave, philip, control, of, the, extensive, portuguese, empire, when, philip, left, for, madrid, in, 1583, he, made, his, nephew, albert, of, austria, his, viceroy, in, lisbon, in, madrid, he, established, a, council, of, portugal, to, advise, him, on, portuguese, affairs, giving, prominent, positions, to, portuguese, nobles, in, the, spanish, courts, and, allowing, portugal, to, maintain, autonomous, law, currency, and, government, this, followed, on, the, well, established, pattern, of, rule, by, councils, philip, s, father, arranged, his, marriage, to, 37, year, old, queen, mary, i, of, england, charles, maternal, first, cousin, his, father, ceded, the, crown, of, naples, as, well, as, his, claim, to, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, to, him, their, marriage, at, winchester, cathedral, on, 25, july, 1554, took, place, just, two, days, after, their, first, meeting, philip, s, view, of, the, affair, was, entirely, political, lord, chancellor, stephen, gardiner, and, the, house, of, commons, petitioned, mary, to, consider, marrying, an, englishman, preferring, edward, courtenay, under, the, terms, of, the, act, for, the, marriage, of, queen, mary, to, philip, of, spain, philip, was, to, enjoy, mary, i, s, titles, and, honours, for, as, long, as, their, marriage, should, last, all, official, documents, including, acts, of, parliament, were, to, be, dated, with, both, their, names, and, parliament, was, to, be, called, under, the, joint, authority, of, the, couple, coins, were, also, to, show, the, heads, of, both, mary, and, philip, the, marriage, treaty, also, provided, that, england, would, not, be, obliged, to, provide, military, support, to, philip, s, father, in, any, war, the, privy, council, instructed, that, philip, and, mary, should, be, joint, signatories, of, royal, documents, and, this, was, enacted, by, an, act, of, parliament, which, gave, him, the, title, of, king, and, stated, that, he, shall, aid, her, highness, in, the, happy, administration, of, her, grace, s, realms, and, dominions, in, other, words, philip, was, to, co, reign, with, his, wife, as, the, new, king, of, england, could, not, read, english, it, was, ordered, that, a, note, of, all, matters, of, state, should, be, made, in, latin, or, spanish, acts, making, it, high, treason, to, deny, philip, s, royal, authority, were, passed, by, the, parliament, of, ireland, and, england, philip, and, mary, appeared, on, coins, together, with, a, single, crown, suspended, between, them, as, a, symbol, of, joint, reign, the, great, seal, shows, philip, and, mary, seated, on, thrones, holding, the, crown, together, the, coat, of, arms, of, england, was, impaled, with, philip, s, to, denote, their, joint, reign, during, their, joint, reign, they, waged, war, against, france, which, resulted, in, the, loss, of, calais, england, s, last, remaining, possession, in, france, philip, s, wife, had, succeeded, to, the, kingdom, of, ireland, but, the, title, of, king, of, ireland, had, been, created, in, 1542, by, mary, s, father, henry, viii, after, he, was, excommunicated, and, so, it, was, not, recognised, by, catholic, monarchs, in, 1555, pope, paul, iv, rectified, this, by, issuing, a, papal, bull, recognising, philip, and, mary, as, rightful, king, and, queen, of, ireland, king, s, county, and, philipstown, in, ireland, were, named, after, philip, as, king, of, ireland, in, 1556, the, couple, s, joint, royal, style, after, philip, ascended, the, spanish, throne, in, 1556, was, philip, and, mary, by, the, grace, of, god, king, and, queen, of, england, spain, france, jerusalem, both, the, sicilies, and, ireland, defenders, of, the, faith, archdukes, of, austria, dukes, of, burgundy, milan, and, brabant, counts, of, habsburg, flanders, and, tirol, however, the, couple, had, no, children, mary, died, in, 1558, before, the, union, could, revitalise, the, roman, catholic, church, in, england, with, her, death, philip, lost, his, rights, to, the, english, throne, including, the, ancient, english, claims, to, the, french, throne, and, ceased, to, be, king, of, england, ireland, and, as, claimed, by, them, france, philip, s, great, grandson, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, married, princess, henrietta, of, england, in, 1661, in, 1807, the, jacobite, claim, to, the, british, throne, passed, to, the, descendants, of, their, child, anne, marie, d, orl, ans, upon, mary, s, death, the, throne, went, to, elizabeth, i, philip, had, no, wish, to, sever, his, tie, with, england, and, had, sent, a, proposal, of, marriage, to, elizabeth, however, she, delayed, in, answering, and, in, that, time, learned, philip, was, also, considering, a, valois, alliance, elizabeth, i, was, the, protestant, daughter, of, henry, viii, and, anne, boleyn, this, union, was, deemed, illegitimate, by, english, catholics, who, disputed, the, validity, of, both, the, annulment, of, henry, s, marriage, to, catherine, of, aragon, and, of, his, subsequent, marriage, to, boleyn, and, hence, claimed, that, mary, queen, of, scots, the, catholic, great, granddaughter, of, henry, vii, was, the, rightful, monarch, for, many, years, philip, maintained, peace, with, england, and, even, defended, elizabeth, from, the, pope, s, threat, of, excommunication, this, was, a, measure, taken, to, preserve, a, european, balance, of, power, ultimately, elizabeth, allied, england, with, the, protestant, rebels, in, the, netherlands, further, english, ships, began, a, policy, of, privateering, against, spain, s, merchant, shipping, and, started, threatening, the, spanish, treasure, ships, coming, from, the, new, world, in, one, instance, english, ships, attacked, a, spanish, port, the, last, straw, for, philip, was, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, signed, by, elizabeth, in, 1585, promising, troops, and, supplies, to, the, anti, spanish, rebels, in, the, netherlands, although, it, can, be, argued, this, english, action, was, the, result, of, philip, s, treaty, of, joinville, with, the, catholic, league, of, france, philip, considered, it, an, act, of, war, by, england, the, execution, of, mary, queen, of, scots, in, 1587, ended, philip, s, hopes, of, placing, a, catholic, on, the, english, throne, he, turned, instead, to, more, direct, plans, to, invade, england, and, return, the, country, to, catholicism, in, 1588, he, sent, a, fleet, the, spanish, armada, to, rendezvous, with, the, army, of, flanders, and, convey, it, across, the, english, channel, however, the, operation, had, little, chance, of, success, from, the, beginning, because, of, lengthy, delays, lack, of, communication, between, philip, ii, and, his, two, commanders, and, the, lack, of, a, deep, bay, for, the, fleet, at, the, point, of, attack, a, storm, struck, the, english, channel, already, known, for, its, harsh, currents, and, choppy, waters, which, devastated, large, numbers, of, the, spanish, fleet, there, was, a, tightly, fought, battle, against, the, english, royal, navy, it, was, by, no, means, a, slaughter, only, one, spanish, ship, was, sunk, but, the, spanish, were, forced, into, a, retreat, and, the, overwhelming, majority, of, the, armada, was, destroyed, by, the, harsh, weather, whilst, the, english, royal, navy, may, not, have, destroyed, the, armada, at, the, battle, of, gravelines, they, had, prevented, it, from, linking, up, with, the, army, it, was, supposed, to, convey, across, the, channel, thus, whilst, the, english, royal, navy, may, have, only, won, a, slight, tactical, victory, over, the, spanish, it, had, delivered, a, major, strategic, one, preventing, the, invasion, of, england, through, a, week, of, fighting, the, spanish, had, expended, 100, 000, cannonballs, but, no, english, ship, was, seriously, damaged, however, over, 7, 000, english, sailors, died, from, disease, during, the, time, the, armada, was, in, english, waters, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, armada, gave, great, heart, to, the, protestant, cause, across, europe, the, storm, that, smashed, the, armada, was, seen, by, many, of, philip, s, enemies, as, a, sign, of, the, will, of, god, while, the, invasion, had, been, averted, england, was, unable, to, take, advantage, of, this, success, an, attempt, to, use, her, newfound, advantage, at, sea, with, a, counter, armada, the, following, year, failed, disastrously, with, 40, ships, sunk, and, 15, 000, men, lost, likewise, english, buccaneering, and, attempts, to, seize, territories, in, the, caribbean, were, defeated, by, spain, s, rebuilt, navy, and, their, improved, intelligence, networks, although, c, diz, was, sacked, by, an, anglo, dutch, force, after, a, failed, attempt, to, seize, the, treasure, fleet, the, habsburgs, also, struck, back, with, the, dunkirkers, who, took, an, increasing, toll, on, dutch, and, english, shipping, eventually, the, spanish, attempted, two, further, armadas, in, october, 1596, and, october, 1597, the, 1596, armada, was, destroyed, in, a, storm, off, northern, spain, it, had, lost, as, many, as, 72, of, its, 126, ships, and, suffered, 3, 000, deaths, the, 1597, armada, was, frustrated, by, adverse, weather, as, it, approached, the, english, coast, undetected, this, anglo, spanish, war, 1585, 1604, would, be, fought, to, a, grinding, end, but, not, until, both, philip, ii, d, 1598, and, elizabeth, i, d, 1603, were, dead, some, of, the, fighting, was, done, on, land, in, ireland, france, and, the, netherlands, with, the, english, sending, expeditionary, forces, to, france, and, the, netherlands, to, fight, spain, and, spain, attempting, to, assist, irish, rebellions, in, ireland, philip, ii, died, in, el, escorial, near, madrid, on, 13, september, 1598, of, cancer, he, was, succeeded, by, his, 20, year, old, son, philip, iii, under, philip, ii, spain, reached, the, peak, of, its, power, however, in, spite, of, the, great, and, increasing, quantities, of, gold, and, silver, flowing, into, his, coffers, from, the, american, mines, the, riches, of, the, portuguese, spice, trade, and, the, enthusiastic, support, of, the, habsburg, dominions, for, the, counter, reformation, he, would, never, succeed, in, suppressing, protestantism, or, defeating, the, dutch, rebellion, early, in, his, reign, the, dutch, might, have, laid, down, their, weapons, if, he, had, desisted, in, trying, to, suppress, protestantism, but, his, devotion, to, catholicism, would, not, permit, him, to, do, so, he, was, a, devout, catholic, and, exhibited, the, typical, 16th, century, antipathy, for, religious, heterodoxy, he, said, before, suffering, the, slightest, damage, to, religion, in, the, service, of, god, i, would, lose, all, of, my, estates, and, a, hundred, lives, if, i, had, them, because, i, do, not, wish, nor, do, i, desire, to, be, the, ruler, of, heretics, as, he, strove, to, enforce, catholic, orthodoxy, through, an, intensification, of, the, inquisition, students, were, barred, from, studying, elsewhere, and, books, printed, by, spaniards, outside, the, kingdom, were, banned, in, addition, to, the, banning, of, books, philip, ii, authorized, the, burning, of, at, least, 70, 000, volumes, even, a, highly, respected, churchman, like, archbishop, bartolome, carranza, of, toledo, was, jailed, by, the, inquisition, for, 17, years, for, publishing, ideas, that, seemed, sympathetic, in, some, degree, with, protestantism, such, strict, enforcement, of, orthodox, belief, was, successful, and, spain, avoided, the, religiously, inspired, strife, tearing, apart, other, european, dominions, although, he, was, deeply, dedicated, to, rooting, out, heretical, titles, he, collected, forbidden, books, for, his, own, royal, library, at, the, el, escorial, his, library, contained, 40, 000, volumes, 1, 800, of, which, were, arabic, titles, and, several, thousand, manuscripts, the, banned, books, were, protected, in, a, room, on, an, upper, floor, of, the, library, he, was, passionate, about, rare, books, he, personally, collected, from, far, and, wide, and, researched, and, recorded, information, about, previous, owners, the, school, of, salamanca, flourished, under, his, reign, mart, n, de, azpilcueta, highly, honoured, at, rome, by, several, popes, and, looked, on, as, an, oracle, of, learning, published, his, manuale, sive, enchiridion, confessariorum, et, poenitentium, rome, 1568, long, a, classical, text, in, the, schools, and, in, ecclesiastical, practice, francisco, su, rez, generally, regarded, as, the, greatest, scholastic, after, thomas, aquinas, and, regarded, during, his, lifetime, as, being, the, greatest, living, philosopher, and, theologian, was, writing, and, lecturing, not, only, in, spain, but, also, in, rome, 1580, 1585, where, pope, gregory, xiii, attended, the, first, lecture, that, he, gave, luis, de, molina, published, his, de, liberi, arbitrii, cum, gratiae, donis, divina, praescientia, praedestinatione, et, reprobatione, concordia, 1588, wherein, he, put, forth, the, doctrine, attempting, to, reconcile, the, omniscience, of, god, with, human, free, will, that, came, to, be, known, as, molinism, thereby, contributing, to, what, was, one, of, the, most, important, intellectual, debates, of, the, time, molinism, became, the, de, facto, jesuit, doctrine, on, these, matters, and, is, still, advocated, today, by, william, lane, craig, and, alvin, plantinga, among, others, because, philip, ii, was, the, most, powerful, european, monarch, in, an, era, of, war, and, religious, conflict, evaluating, both, his, reign, and, the, man, himself, has, become, a, controversial, historical, subject, even, before, his, death, in, 1598, his, supporters, had, started, presenting, him, as, an, archetypical, gentleman, full, of, piety, and, christian, virtues, whereas, his, enemies, depicted, him, as, a, fanatical, and, despotic, monster, responsible, for, inhuman, cruelties, and, barbarism, this, dichotomy, further, developed, into, the, so, called, spanish, black, legend, and, white, legend, was, helped, by, king, philip, himself, philip, prohibited, any, biographical, account, of, his, life, to, be, published, while, he, was, alive, and, he, ordered, that, all, his, private, correspondence, be, burned, shortly, before, he, died, moreover, philip, did, nothing, to, defend, himself, after, being, betrayed, by, his, ambitious, secretary, antonio, p, rez, who, published, incredible, calumnies, against, his, former, master, this, allowed, p, rez, s, tales, to, spread, all, around, europe, unchallenged, that, way, the, popular, image, of, the, king, that, survives, to, today, was, created, on, the, eve, of, his, death, at, a, time, when, many, european, princes, and, religious, leaders, were, turned, against, spain, as, a, pillar, of, the, counter, reformation, this, means, that, many, histories, depict, philip, from, deeply, prejudiced, points, of, view, usually, negative, however, some, historians, classify, this, anti, spanish, analysis, as, part, of, the, black, legend, in, a, more, recent, example, of, popular, culture, philip, ii, s, portrayal, in, fire, over, england, 1937, is, not, entirely, unsympathetic, he, is, shown, as, a, very, hardworking, intelligent, religious, somewhat, paranoid, ruler, whose, prime, concern, is, his, country, but, who, had, no, understanding, of, the, english, despite, his, former, co, monarchy, there, even, in, countries, that, remained, catholic, primarily, france, and, the, italian, states, fear, and, envy, of, spanish, success, and, domination, created, a, wide, receptiveness, for, the, worst, possible, descriptions, of, philip, ii, although, some, efforts, have, been, made, to, separate, legend, from, reality, that, task, has, proved, extremely, difficult, since, many, prejudices, are, rooted, in, the, cultural, heritage, of, european, countries, spanish, speaking, historians, tend, to, assess, his, political, and, military, achievements, sometimes, deliberately, avoiding, issues, such, as, the, king, s, inflexible, catholicism, english, speaking, historians, tend, to, show, philip, ii, as, a, fanatical, despotical, criminal, imperialist, monster, minimising, his, military, victories, battle, of, lepanto, battle, of, saint, quentin, etc, to, mere, anecdotes, and, magnifying, his, defeats, namely, the, armada, even, though, at, the, time, those, defeats, did, not, result, in, great, political, or, military, changes, in, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, moreover, it, has, been, noted, that, objectively, assessing, philip, s, reign, would, necessitate, a, re, analysis, of, the, reign, of, his, greatest, opponents, namely, england, s, queen, elizabeth, i, and, the, dutch, william, the, silent, who, are, popularly, regarded, as, great, heroes, in, their, home, nations, if, philip, ii, is, to, be, shown, to, the, english, or, dutch, public, in, a, more, favourable, light, elizabeth, and, william, would, lose, their, cold, blooded, fanatical, enemy, thus, decreasing, their, own, patriotic, accomplishments, he, ended, french, valois, ambitions, in, italy, and, brought, about, the, habsburg, ascendency, in, europe, he, secured, the, portuguese, kingdom, and, empire, he, succeeded, in, increasing, the, importation, of, silver, in, the, face, of, english, dutch, and, french, privateers, overcoming, multiple, financial, crises, and, consolidating, spain, s, overseas, empire, although, clashes, would, be, ongoing, he, ended, the, major, threat, posed, to, europe, by, the, ottoman, navy, historian, geoffrey, parker, offers, a, management, psychological, explanation, as, summarized, by, tonio, andrade, and, william, reger, one, might, have, expected, that, philip, being, a, dedicated, persistent, and, hard, working, man, and, being, the, head, of, western, europe, s, wealthiest, and, largest, empire, would, have, succeeded, in, his, aims, he, didn, t, his, endeavors, were, doomed, by, his, own, character, or, at, least, that, s, how, parker, sees, it, drawing, on, studies, in, management, science, and, organizational, psychology, parker, argues, that, a, successful, manager, of, a, large, organization, must, keep, attention, on, the, big, picture, must, have, a, good, strategy, for, dealing, with, copious, information, must, know, how, to, delegate, and, must, be, flexible, philip, failed, on, all, counts, he, was, a, micromanager, who, got, bogged, down, in, details, refusing, to, delegate, and, trying, to, read, every, dispatch, that, came, to, his, desk, he, obsessed, and, dithered, so, that, by, the, time, his, decisions, were, made, and, his, orders, reached, the, men, meant, to, carry, them, out, the, situation, on, the, ground, had, changed, philip, was, also, inflexible, unwilling, to, abandon, ineffective, policies, most, pernicious, of, all, was, philip, s, tendency, toward, messianic, thinking, a, belief, that, he, was, doing, god, s, work, and, that, heaven, would, support, him, with, miracles, philip, continued, his, father, s, style, of, majesty, latin, maiestas, spanish, majestad, in, preference, to, that, of, highness, celsitudo, alteza, in, diplomatic, texts, he, continued, the, use, of, the, title, most, catholic, rex, catholicissimus, rey, cat, lico, first, bestowed, by, pope, alexander, vi, on, ferdinand, and, isabella, in, 1496, following, the, act, of, parliament, sanctioning, his, marriage, with, mary, the, couple, was, styled, philip, and, mary, by, the, grace, of, god, king, and, queen, of, england, france, naples, jerusalem, and, ireland,

spain, in, 1556, they, became, philip, and, mary, by, the, grace, of, god, king, and, queen, of, england, spain, france, both, the, sicilies, jerusalem, and, ireland, defenders, of, the, faith,

married, four, times, and, had, children, with, three, of, his, wives, he, also, had, two, long, term, relationships, with, isabel, osorio, and, eufrasia, de, guzm, n, philip, s, first, wife, was, his, double, first, cousin, maria, manuela, princess, of, portugal, she, was, a, daughter, of, philip, s, maternal, uncle, john, iii, of, portugal, and, paternal, aunt, catherine, of, austria, they, were, married, at, salamanca, on, 12, november, 1543, the, marriage, produced, one, son, in, 1545, after, which, maria, died, four, days, later, due, to, haemorrhage, philip, s, second, wife, was, his, first, cousin, once, removed, queen, mary, i, of, england, the, marriage, which, took, place, on, 25, july, 1554, at, winchester, cathedral, was, political, by, this, marriage, philip, became, jure, uxoris, king, of, england, and, ireland, although, the, couple, was, apart, more, than, together, as, they, ruled, their, respective, countries, the, marriage, produced, no, children, although, there, was, a, false, pregnancy, and, mary, died, in, 1558, ending, philip, s, reign, in, england, and, ireland, philip, s, third, wife, was, elisabeth, of, valois, the, eldest, daughter, of, henry,

initially, refused, to, grant, philip, the, dispensation, needed, to, marry, anna, citing, biblical, prohibitions, and, the, danger, of, birth, defects, the, pope, reluctantly, gave, his, permission, when, philip, threatened, to, abandon, the, holy, league, in, their, fight, against, the, ottoman, turks, by, contemporary, accounts, this, was, a, convivial, and, satisfactory, marriage, 1570, 1580,
