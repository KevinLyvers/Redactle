her, bedroom, staying, up, late, at, night, in, the, harsh, russian, cold, caused, her, to, fall, ill, with, pneumonia, though, she, survived, and, recovered, in, her, memoirs, she, wrote, that, she, made, the, decision, then, to, do, whatever, was, necessary, and, to, profess, to, believe, whatever, was, required, of, her, to, become, qualified, to, wear, the, crown, although, she, was, able, to,

in, her, court, in, fact, the, use, of, french, as, the, main, language, of, the, russian, imperial, court, continued, until, 1812, when, it, became, politically, incorrect, to, speak, french, in, court, due, to, the, war, with, napoleonic, france, sophie, recalled, in, her, memoirs, that, as, soon, as, she, arrived, in, russia, she, fell, ill, with, a, pleuritis, that, almost, killed, her, she, credited, her, survival, to, frequent, bloodletting, in, a, single, day, she, received, four, phlebotomies, her, mother, s, opposition, to, this, practice, brought, her, the, empress, s, disfavour, when, sophie, s, situation, looked, desperate, her, mother, wanted, her, confessed, by, a, lutheran, pastor, awaking, from, her, delirium, however, sophie, said, i, don, t, want, any, lutheran, i, want, my, orthodox, father, this, increased, her, popularity, with, the, empress, and, her, court, as, a, whole, elizabeth, doted, on, sophie, and, saw, her, as, a, daughter, after, this, sophie, s, father, a, devout, german, lutheran, opposed, his, daughter, s, conversion, to, eastern, orthodoxy, despite, his, objections, on, 28, june, 1744, the, russian, orthodox, church, received, sophie, as, a, member, it, was, then, that, she, took, the, new, name, catherine, yekaterina, or, ekaterina, and, the, artificial, patronymic, alekseyevna, daughter, of, aleksey, so, that, she, was, in, all, respects, the, namesake, of, catherine, i, the, mother, of, elizabeth, and, the, grandmother, of, peter, iii, the, following, year, on, 21, august, 1745, the, long, planned, dynastic,

bridegroom, then, known, as, peter, von, holstein, gottorp, had, become, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, located, in, the, north, west, of, present, day, germany, near, the, border, with, denmark, in, 1739, the, newlyweds, settled, in, the, palace, of, oranienbaum, which, remained, the, residence, of, the, young, court, for, many, years, from, there, they, governed, the, duchy, which, occupied, less, than, a, third, of, the, current, german, state, of, schleswig, holstein, even, including, that, part, of, schleswig, occupied, by, denmark, to, obtain, experience, to, govern, russia, apart, from, providing, that, experience, the, marriage, was, unsuccessful, it, was, not, consummated, for, years, due, to, peter, iii, s, mental, immaturity, after, peter, took, a, mistress, catherine, became, involved, with, other, prominent, court, figures, she, soon, became, popular, with, several, powerful, political, groups, that, opposed, her, husband, unhappy, with, her, husband, catherine, became, an, avid, reader, of, books, mostly, in, french, she, disparaged, her, husband, for, his, devotion, to, reading, on, the, one, hand, lutheran, prayer, books, the, other, the, history, of, and, trial, of, some, highway, robbers, who, had, been, hanged, or, broken, on, the, wheel, it, was, during, this, period, that, she, first, read, voltaire, and, the, other, philosophes, of, the, french, enlightenment, as, she, learned, russian, she, became, increasingly, interested, in, the, literature, of, her, adopted, country, finally, it, was, the, annals, by, tacitus, that, caused, what, she, called, a, revolution, in, her, teenage, mind, as, tacitus, was, the, first, intellectual, she, read, who, understood, power, politics, as, they, are, not, as, they, should, be, she, was, especially, impressed, with, his, argument, that, people, do, not, act, for, their, professed, idealistic, reasons, and, instead, she, learned, to, look, for, the, hidden, and, interested, motives, according, to, alexander, hertzen, who, edited, a, version, of, catherine, s, memoirs, catherine, had, her, first, sexual, relationship, with, sergei, saltykov, while, living, at, oranienbaum, as, her, marriage, to, peter, had, not, yet, been, consummated, as, catherine, later, claimed, nonetheless, catherine, would, eventually, leave, the, final, version, of, her, memoirs, to, her, son, the, future, paul, i, in, which, she, explained, why, paul, had, been, peter, s, son, saltykov, was, used, to, make, peter, jealous, and, she, did, not, desire, to, have, a, child, with, him, catherine, wanted, to, become, empress, herself, and, did, not, want, another, heir, to, the, throne, however, elizabeth, blackmailed, peter, and, catherine, to, produce, this, heir, peter, and, catherine, had, both, been, involved, in, a, 1749, russian, military, plot, to, crown, peter, together, with, catherine, in, elizabeth, s, stead, as, a, result, of, this, plot, elizabeth, likely, wanted, to, deny, both, catherine, and, peter, any, rights, to, the, russian, throne, elizabeth, therefore, allowed, catherine, to, have, sexual, lovers, only, after, a, new, legal, heir, catherine, and, peter, s, son, paul, survived, and, appeared, to, be, strong, after, this, catherine, carried, on, sexual, liaisons, over, the, years, with, many, men, including, stanislaus, augustus, poniatowski, grigory, grigoryevich, orlov, 1734, 1783, alexander, vasilchikov, grigory, potemkin, ivan, rimsky, korsakov, and, others, she, became, friends, with, princess, ekaterina, vorontsova, dashkova, the, sister, of, her, husband, s, official, mistress, in, dashkov, s, opinion, dashkov, introduced, catherine, to, several, powerful, political, groups, that, opposed, her, husband, however, catherine, had, been, involved, in, military, schemes, against, elizabeth, with, the, likely, goal, of, subsequently, getting, rid, of, peter, iii, since, at, least, 1749, peter, iii, s, temperament, became, quite, unbearable, for, those, who, resided, in, the, palace, he, would, announce, trying, drills, in, the, morning, to, male, servants, who, later, joined, catherine, in, her, room, to, sing, and, dance, until, late, hours, in, 1759, catherine, became, pregnant, with, her, second, child, anna, who, only, lived, to, 14, months, due, to, various, rumours, of, catherine, s, promiscuity, peter, was, led, to, believe, he, was, not, the, child, s, biological, father, and, is, known, to, have, proclaimed, go, to, the, devil, when, catherine, angrily, dismissed, his, accusation, she, therefore, spent, much, of, this, time, alone, in, her, private, boudoir, to, hide, away, from, peter, s, abrasive, personality, in, the, first, version, of, her, memoirs, edited, and, published, by, alexander, hertzen, catherine, strongly, implied, that, the, real, father, of, her, son, paul, was, not, peter, but, rather, saltykov, catherine, recalled, in, her, memoirs, her, optimistic, and, resolute, mood, before, her, accession, to, the, throne, i, used, to, say, to, myself, that, happiness, and, misery, depend, on, ourselves, if, you, feel, unhappy, raise, yourself, above, unhappiness, and, so, act, that, your, happiness, may, be, independent, of, all, eventualities, after, the, death, of, the, empress, elizabeth, on, 5, january, 1762, os, 25, december, 1761, peter, succeeded, to, the, throne, as, emperor,

defected, to, russia, it, was, widely, expected, that, a, 13, 000, strong, russian, corps, would, be, led, by, the, seasoned, general, ivan, gudovich, but, the, empress, followed, the, advice, of, her, lover, prince, zubov, and, entrusted, the, command, to, his, youthful, brother, count, valerian, zubov, the, russian, troops, set, out, from, kizlyar, in, april, 1796, and, stormed, the, key, fortress, of, derbent, on, 21, may, os, 10, may, the, event, was, glorified, by, the, court, poet, derzhavin, in, his, famous, ode, he, later, commented, bitterly, on, zubov, s, inglorious, return, from, the, expedition, in, another, famous, poem, by, mid, june, 1796, zubov, s, troops, easily, overran, most, of, the, territory, of, modern, day, azerbaijan, including, three, principal, cities, baku, shemakha, and, ganja, by, november, they, were, stationed, at, the, confluence, of, the, araks, and, kura, rivers, poised, to, attack, mainland, iran, in, this, month, catherine, died, and, her, son, and, successor, paul, i, who, detested, that, the, zubovs, had, other, plans, for, the, army, ordered, the, troops, to, retreat, to, russia, this, reversal, aroused, the, frustration, and, enmity, of, the, powerful, zubovs, and, other, officers, who, took, part, in, the, campaign, many, of, them, would, be, among, the, conspirators, who, arranged, paul, s, murder, five, years, later, catherine, longed, for, recognition, as, an, enlightened, sovereign, she, refused, the, duchy, of, holstein, gottorp, which, had, ports, on, the, coast, of, the, atlantic, ocean, and, refrained, from, having, a, russian, army, in, germany, instead, she, pioneered, for, russia, the, role, that, britain, later, played, through, most, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, as, an, international, mediator, in, disputes, that, could, or, did, lead, to, war, she, acted, as, mediator, in, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, 1778, 1779, between, the, german, states, of, prussia, and, austria, in, 1780, she, established, a, league, of, armed, neutrality, designed, to, defend, neutral, shipping, from, being, searched, by, the, british, royal, navy, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, from, 1788, to, 1790, russia, fought, a, war, against, sweden, instigated, by, catherine, s, cousin, king, gustav, iii, of, sweden, who, expected, to, overrun, the, russian, armies, still, engaged, in, war, against, the, ottomans, and, hoped, to, strike, saint, petersburg, directly, but, russia, s, baltic, fleet, checked, the, royal, swedish, navy, in, the, tied, battle, of, hogland, july, 1788, and, the, swedish, army, failed, to, advance, denmark, declared, war, on, sweden, in, 1788, the, theatre, war, after, the, decisive, defeat, of, the, russian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, svensksund, in, 1790, the, parties, signed, the, treaty, of, v, r, l, 14, august, 1790, returning, all, conquered, territories, to, their, respective, owners, and, confirming, the, treaty, of, bo, russia, was, to, stop, any, involvement, in, the, internal, affairs, of, sweden, large, sums, were, paid, to, gustav, iii, and, peace, ensued, for, 20, years, even, in, spite, of, the, assassination, of, gustav, iii, in, 1792, in, 1764, catherine, placed, stanislaus, augustus, poniatowski, her, former, lover, on, the, polish, throne, although, the, idea, of, partitioning, poland, came, from, frederick, ii, of, prussia, catherine, took, a, leading, role, in, its, execution, in, the, 1790s, in, 1768, she, formally, became, the, protector, of, the, political, rights, of, dissidents, and, peasants, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, which, provoked, an, anti, russian, uprising, in, poland, the, confederation, of, bar, 1768, 1772, supported, by, france, after, the, rebels, their, french, and, european, volunteers, and, their, allied, ottoman, empire, had, been, defeated, she, established, in, the, commonwealth, a, system, of, government, fully, controlled, by, the, russian, empire, through, a, permanent, council, under, the, supervision, of, her, ambassadors, and, envoys, fearing, that, the, may, constitution, of, poland, 1791, might, lead, to, a, resurgence, in, the, power, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, the, growing, democratic, movements, inside, the, commonwealth, might, become, a, threat, to, the, european, monarchies, catherine, decided, to, refrain, from, her, planned, intervention, into, france, and, to, intervene, in, poland, instead, she, provided, support, to, a, polish, anti, reform, group, known, as, the, targowica, confederation, after, defeating, polish, loyalist, forces, in, the, polish, russian, war, of, 1792, and, in, the, ko, ciuszko, uprising, 1794, russia, completed, the, partitioning, of, poland, dividing, all, of, the, remaining, commonwealth, territory, with, prussia, and, austria, 1795, the, qianlong, emperor, of, china, was, committed, to, an, expansionist, policy, in, central, asia, and, saw, the, russian, empire, as, a, potential, rival, making, for, difficult, and, unfriendly, relations, between, beijing, and, saint, petersburg, in, 1762, he, unilaterally, abrogated, the, treaty, of, kyakhta, which, governed, the, caravan, trade, between, the, two, empires, another, source, of, tension, was, the, wave, of, dzungar, mongol, fugitives, from, the, qing, empire, who, took, refuge, with, the, russians, the, dzungar, genocide, which, was, committed, by, the, qing, empire, had, led, many, dzungars, to, seek, sanctuary, in, the, russian, empire, and, it, was, also, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, abrogation, of, the, treaty, of, kyakhta, catherine, perceived, that, the, qianlong, emperor, was, an, unpleasant, and, arrogant, neighbour, once, saying, i, shall, not, die, until, i, have, ejected, the, turks, from, europe, suppressed, the, pride, of, china, and, established, trade, with, india, in, a, 1790, letter, to, baron, de, grimm, written, in, french, she, called, the, qianlong, emperor, mon, voisin, chinois, aux, petits, yeux, my, chinese, neighbour, with, small, eyes, in, the, far, east, russians, became, active, in, fur, trapping, in, kamchatka, and, the, kuril, islands, this, spurred, russian, interest, in, opening, trade, with, japan, to, the, south, for, supplies, and, food, in, 1783, storms, drove, a, japanese, sea, captain, daikokuya, k, day, ashore, in, the, aleutian, islands, at, that, time, russian, territory, russian, local, authorities, helped, his, party, and, the, russian, government, decided, to, use, him, as, a, trade, envoy, on, 28, june, 1791, catherine, granted, daikokuya, an, audience, at, tsarskoye, selo, subsequently, in, 1792, the, russian, government, dispatched, a, trade, mission, to, japan, led, by, adam, laxman, the, tokugawa, shogunate, received, the, mission, but, negotiations, failed, nicholas, i, her, grandson, evaluated, the, foreign, policy, of, catherine, the, great, as, a, dishonest, one, catherine, failed, to, reach, any, of, the, initial, goals, she, had, put, forward, her, foreign, policy, lacked, a, long, term, strategy, and, from, the, very, start, was, characterised, by, a, series, of, mistakes, she, lost, the, large, territories, of, the, russian, protectorate, of, the, commonwealth, of, poland, and, lithuania, and, left, its, territories, to, prussia, and, austria, the, commonwealth, had, become, the, russian, protectorate, since, the, reign, of, peter, i, but, he, did, not, intervene, into, the, problem, of, political, freedoms, of, dissidents, advocating, for, their, religious, freedoms, only, catherine, did, turn, russia, into, a, global, great, power, not, only, a, european, one, but, with, quite, a, different, reputation, from, what, she, initially, had, planned, as, an, honest, policy, the, global, trade, of, russian, natural, resources, and, russian, grain, provoked, famines, starvation, and, fear, of, famines, in, russia, her, dynasty, lost, power, because, of, this, and, of, a, war, with, austria, and, germany, impossible, without, her, foreign, policy, russian, economic, development, was, well, below, the, standards, in, western, europe, historian, fran, ois, cruzet, writes, that, russia, under, catherine, had, neither, a, free, peasantry, nor, a, significant, middle, class, nor, legal, norms, hospitable, to, private, enterprise, still, there, was, a, start, of, industry, mainly, textiles, around, moscow, and, ironworks, in, the, ural, mountains, with, a, labour, force, mainly, of, serfs, bound, to, the, works, catherine, imposed, a, comprehensive, system, of, state, regulation, of, merchants, activities, it, was, a, failure, because, it, narrowed, and, stifled, entrepreneurship, and, did, not, reward, economic, development, she, had, more, success, when, she, strongly, encouraged, the, migration, of, the, volga, germans, farmers, from, germany, who, settled, mostly, in, the, volga, river, valley, region, they, indeed, helped, modernise, the, sector, that, totally, dominated, the, russian, economy, they, introduced, numerous, innovations, regarding, wheat, production, and, flour, milling, tobacco, culture, sheep, raising, and, small, scale, manufacturing, in, 1768, the, assignation, bank, was, given, the, task, of, issuing, the, first, government, paper, money, it, opened, in, saint, petersburg, and, moscow, in, 1769, several, bank, branches, were, afterwards, established, in, other, towns, called, government, towns, paper, notes, were, issued, upon, payment, of, similar, sums, in, copper, money, which, were, also, refunded, upon, the, presentation, of, those, notes, the, emergence, of, these, assignation, roubles, was, necessary, due, to, large, government, spending, on, military, needs, which, led, to, a, shortage, of, silver, in, the, treasury, transactions, especially, in, foreign, trade, were, conducted, almost, exclusively, in, silver, and, gold, coins, assignation, roubles, circulated, on, equal, footing, with, the, silver, rouble, a, market, exchange, rate, for, these, two, currencies, was, ongoing, the, use, of, these, notes, continued, until, 1849, catherine, paid, a, great, deal, of, attention, to, financial, reform, and, relied, heavily, on, the, advice, of, prince, a, a, viazemski, she, found, that, piecemeal, reform, worked, poorly, because, there, was, no, overall, view, of, a, comprehensive, state, budget, money, was, needed, for, wars, and, necessitated, the, junking, of, the, old, financial, institutions, a, key, principle, was, responsibilities, defined, by, function, it, was, instituted, by, the, fundamental, law, of, 7, november, 1775, vaizemski, s, office, of, state, revenue, took, centralised, control, and, by, 1781, the, government, possessed, its, first, approximation, of, a, state, budget, catherine, made, public, health, a, priority, she, made, use, of, the, social, theory, ideas, of, german, cameralism, and, french, physiocracy, as, well, as, russian, precedents, and, experiments, such, as, foundling, homes, in, 1764, she, launched, the, moscow, foundling, home, and, lying, in, hospital, in, 1763, she, opened, paul, s, hospital, also, known, as, pavlovskaya, hospital, she, had, the, government, collect, and, publish, vital, statistics, in, 1762, she, called, on, the, army, to, upgrade, its, medical, services, she, established, a, centralised, medical, administration, charged, with, initiating, vigorous, health, policies, catherine, decided, to, have, herself, inoculated, against, smallpox, by, english, doctor, thomas, dimsdale, while, this, was, considered, a, controversial, method, at, the, time, she, succeeded, her, son, pavel, later, was, inoculated, as, well, catherine, then, sought, to, have, inoculations, throughout, her, empire, and, stated, my, objective, was, through, my, example, to, save, from, death, the, multitude, of, my, subjects, who, not, knowing, the, value, of, this, technique, and, frightened, of, it, were, left, in, danger, by, 1800, approximately, 2, million, inoculations, almost, 6, of, the, population, were, administered, in, the, russian, empire, historians, consider, her, efforts, to, be, a, success, according, to, a, census, taken, from, 1754, to, 1762, catherine, owned, 500, 000, serfs, a, further, 2, 8, million, belonged, to, the, russian, state, at, the, time, of, catherine, s, reign, the, landowning, noble, class, owned, the, serfs, who, were, bound, to, the, land, they, tilled, children, of, serfs, were, born, into, serfdom, and, worked, the, same, land, their, parents, had, even, before, the, rule, of, catherine, serfs, had, very, limited, rights, but, they, were, not, exactly, slaves, while, the, state, did, not, technically, allow, them, to, own, possessions, some, serfs, were, able, to, accumulate, enough, wealth, to, pay, for, their, freedom, the, understanding, of, law, in, imperial, russia, by, all, sections, of, society, was, often, weak, confused, or, nonexistent, particularly, in, the, provinces, where, most, serfs, lived, this, is, why, some, serfs, were, able, to, do, things, such, as, to, accumulate, wealth, to, become, serfs, people, conceded, their, freedoms, to, a, landowner, in, exchange, for, their, protection, and, support, in, times, of, hardship, in, addition, they, received, land, to, till, but, were, taxed, a, certain, percentage, of, their, crops, to, give, to, their, landowners, these, were, the, privileges, a, serf, was, entitled, to, and, that, nobles, were, bound, to, carry, out, all, of, this, was, true, before, catherine, s, reign, and, this, is, the, system, she, inherited, catherine, did, initiate, some, changes, to, serfdom, if, a, noble, did, not, live, up, to, his, side, of, the, deal, the, serfs, could, file, complaints, against, him, by, following, the, proper, channels, of, law, catherine, gave, them, this, new, right, but, in, exchange, they, could, no, longer, appeal, directly, to, her, she, did, this, because, she, did, not, want, to, be, bothered, by, the, peasantry, but, did, not, want, to, give, them, reason, to, revolt, in, this, act, she, gave, the, serfs, a, legitimate, bureaucratic, status, they, had, lacked, before, some, serfs, were, able, to, use, their, new, status, to, their, advantage, for, example, serfs, could, apply, to, be, freed, if, they, were, under, illegal, ownership, and, non, nobles, were, not, allowed, to, own, serfs, some, serfs, did, apply, for, freedom, and, were, successful, in, addition, some, governors, listened, to, the, complaints, of, serfs, and, punished, nobles, but, this, was, by, no, means, universal, other, than, these, the, rights, of, a, serf, were, very, limited, a, landowner, could, punish, his, serfs, at, his, discretion, and, under, catherine, the, great, gained, the, ability, to, sentence, his, serfs, to, hard, labour, in, siberia, a, punishment, normally, reserved, for, convicted, criminals, the, only, thing, a, noble, could, not, do, to, his, serfs, was, to, kill, them, the, life, of, a, serf, belonged, to, the, state, historically, when, the, serfs, faced, problems, they, could, not, solve, on, their, own, such, as, abusive, masters, they, often, appealed, to, the, autocrat, and, continued, doing, so, during, catherine, s, reign, but, she, signed, legislation, prohibiting, it, although, she, did, not, want, to, communicate, directly, with, the, serfs, she, did, create, some, measures, to, improve, their, conditions, as, a, class, and, reduce, the, size, of, the, institution, of, serfdom, for, example, she, took, action, to, limit, the, number, of, new, serfs, she, eliminated, many, ways, for, people, to, become, serfs, culminating, in, the, manifesto, of, 17, march, 1775, which, prohibited, a, serf, who, had, once, been, freed, from, becoming, a, serf, again, while, the, majority, of, serfs, were, farmers, bound, to, the, land, a, noble, could, have, his, serfs, sent, away, to, learn, a, trade, or, be, educated, at, a, school, as, well, as, employ, them, at, businesses, that, paid, wages, this, happened, more, often, during, catherine, s, reign, because, of, the, new, schools, she, established, only, in, this, way, apart, from, conscription, to, the, army, could, a, serf, leave, the, farm, for, which, he, was, responsible, but, this, was, used, for, selling, serfs, to, people, who, could, not, own, them, legally, because, of, absence, of, nobility, abroad, the, attitude, of, the, serfs, toward, their, autocrat, had, historically, been, a, positive, one, however, if, the, empress, policies, were, too, extreme, or, too, disliked, she, was, not, considered, the, true, empress, in, these, cases, it, was, necessary, to, replace, this, fake, empress, with, the, true, empress, whoever, she, may, be, because, the, serfs, had, no, political, power, they, rioted, to, convey, their, message, however, usually, if, the, serfs, did, not, like, the, policies, of, the, empress, they, saw, the, nobles, as, corrupt, and, evil, preventing, the, people, of, russia, from, communicating, with, the, well, intentioned, empress, and, misinterpreting, her, decrees, however, they, were, already, suspicious, of, catherine, upon, her, accession, because, she, had, annulled, an, act, by, peter, iii, that, essentially, freed, the, serfs, belonging, to, the, orthodox, church, naturally, the, serfs, did, not, like, it, when, catherine, tried, to, take, away, their, right, to, petition, her, because, they, felt, as, though, she, had, severed, their, connection, to, the, autocrat, and, their, power, to, appeal, to, her, far, away, from, the, capital, they, were, confused, as, to, the, circumstances, of, her, accession, to, the, throne, the, peasants, were, discontented, because, of, many, other, factors, as, well, including, crop, failure, and, epidemics, especially, a, major, epidemic, in, 1771, the, nobles, were, imposing, a, stricter, rule, than, ever, reducing, the, land, of, each, serf, and, restricting, their, freedoms, further, beginning, around, 1767, their, discontent, led, to, widespread, outbreaks, of, violence, and, rioting, during, pugachev, s, rebellion, of, 1774, the, serfs, probably, followed, someone, who, was, pretending, to, be, the, true, empress, because, of, their, feelings, of, disconnection, to, catherine, and, her, policies, empowering, the, nobles, but, this, was, not, the, first, time, they, followed, a, pretender, under, catherine, s, reign, pugachev, had, made, stories, about, himself, acting, as, a, real, emperor, should, helping, the, common, people, listening, to, their, problems, praying, for, them, and, generally, acting, saintly, and, this, helped, rally, the, peasants, and, serfs, with, their, very, conservative, values, to, his, cause, with, all, this, discontent, in, mind, catherine, did, rule, for, 10, years, before, the, anger, of, the, serfs, boiled, over, into, a, rebellion, as, extensive, as, pugachev, s, the, rebellion, ultimately, failed, and, in, fact, backfired, as, catherine, was, pushed, away, from, the, idea, of, serf, liberation, following, the, violent, uprising, under, catherine, s, rule, despite, her, enlightened, ideals, the, serfs, were, generally, unhappy, and, discontented, catherine, was, a, patron, of, the, arts, literature, and, education, the, hermitage, museum, which, now, occupies, the, whole, winter, palace, began, as, catherine, s, personal, collection, the, empress, was, a, great, lover, of, art, and, books, and, ordered, the, construction, of, the, hermitage, in, 1770, to, house, her, expanding, collection, of, paintings, sculpture, and, books, by, 1790, the, hermitage, was, home, to, 38, 000, books, 10, 000, gems, and, 10, 000, drawings, two, wings, were, devoted, to, her, collections, of, curiosities, she, ordered, the, planting, of, the, first, english, landscape, garden, at, tsarskoye, selo, in, may, 1770, in, a, letter, to, voltaire, in, 1772, she, wrote, right, now, i, adore, english, gardens, curves, gentle, slopes, ponds, in, the, form, of, lakes, archipelagos, on, dry, land, and, i, have, a, profound, scorn, for, straight, lines, symmetric, avenues, i, hate, fountains, that, torture, water, in, order, to, make, it, take, a, course, contrary, to, its, nature, statues, are, relegated, to, galleries, vestibules, etc, in, a, word, anglomania, is, the, master, of, my, plantomania, catherine, shared, in, the, general, european, craze, for, all, things, chinese, and, made, a, point, of, collecting, chinese, art, and, buying, porcelain, in, the, popular, chinoiserie, style, between, 1762, and, 1766, she, had, built, the, chinese, palace, at, oranienbaum, which, reflected, the, chinoiserie, style, of, architecture, and, gardening, the, chinese, palace, was, designed, by, the, italian, architect, antonio, rinaldi, who, specialised, in, the, chinoiserie, style, in, 1779, she, hired, the, scottish, architect, charles, cameron, to, build, the, chinese, village, at, tsarskoye, selo, catherine, had, at, first, attempted, to, hire, a, chinese, architect, to, build, the, chinese, village, and, on, finding, that, was, impossible, settled, on, cameron, who, likewise, specialised, in, the, chinoiserie, style, she, made, a, special, effort, to, bring, leading, intellectuals, and, scientists, to, russia, and, she, wrote, her, own, comedies, works, of, fiction, and, memoirs, she, worked, with, voltaire, diderot, and, d, alembert, all, french, encyclopedists, who, later, cemented, her, reputation, in, their, writings, the, leading, economists, of, her, day, such, as, arthur, young, and, jacques, necker, became, foreign, members, of, the, free, economic, society, established, on, her, suggestion, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1765, she, recruited, the, scientists, leonhard, euler, and, peter, simon, pallas, from, berlin, and, anders, johan, lexell, from, sweden, to, the, russian, capital, catherine, enlisted, voltaire, to, her, cause, and, corresponded, with, him, for, 15, years, from, her, accession, to, his, death, in, 1778, he, lauded, her, accomplishments, calling, her, the, star, of, the, north, and, the, semiramis, of, russia, in, reference, to, the, legendary, queen, of, babylon, a, subject, on, which, he, published, a, tragedy, in, 1768, although, she, never, met, him, face, to, face, she, mourned, him, bitterly, when, he, died, she, acquired, his, collection, of, books, from, his, heirs, and, placed, them, in, the, national, library, of, russia, catherine, read, three, sorts, of, books, namely, those, for, pleasure, those, for, information, and, those, to, provide, her, with, a, philosophy, in, the, first, category, she, read, romances, and, comedies, that, were, popular, at, the, time, many, of, which, were, regarded, as, inconsequential, by, the, critics, both, then, and, since, she, especially, liked, the, work, of, german, comic, writers, such, as, moritz, august, von, th, mmel, and, christoph, friedrich, nicolai, in, the, second, category, fell, the, work, of, denis, diderot, jacques, necker, johann, bernhard, basedow, and, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, catherine, expressed, some, frustration, with, the, economists, she, read, for, what, she, regarded, as, their, impractical, theories, writing, in, the, margin, of, one, of, necker, s, books, that, if, it, was, possible, to, solve, all, of, the, state, s, economic, problems, in, one, day, she, would, have, done, so, a, long, time, ago, for, information, about, particular, nations, that, interested, her, she, read, jean, baptiste, bourguignon, d, anville, s, memoirs, de, chine, to, learn, about, the, vast, and, wealthy, chinese, empire, that, bordered, her, empire, fran, ois, baron, de, tott, s, memoires, de, les, turcs, et, les, tartares, for, information, about, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, crimean, khanate, the, books, of, frederick, the, great, praising, himself, to, learn, about, frederick, just, as, much, as, to, learn, about, prussia, and, pamphlets, written, by, benjamin, franklin, denouncing, the, british, crown, to, understand, the, reasons, behind, the, american, revolution, in, the, third, category, fell, the, work, of, voltaire, friedrich, melchior, baron, von, grimm, ferdinando, galiani, nicolas, baudeau, and, sir, william, blackstone, for, philosophy, she, liked, books, promoting, what, has, been, called, enlightened, despotism, which, she, embraced, as, her, ideal, of, an, autocratic, but, reformist, government, that, operated, according, to, the, rule, of, law, not, the, whims, of, the, ruler, hence, her, interest, in, blackstone, s, legal, commentaries, within, a, few, months, of, her, accession, in, 1762, having, heard, the, french, government, threatened, to, stop, the, publication, of, the, famous, french, encyclop, die, on, account, of, its,

appearances, with, her, head, held, high, her, eagle, like, stare, and, a, countenance, accustomed, to, command, all, this, gave, her, such, an, air, of, majesty, that, to, me, she, might, have, been,

created, by, inculcating, russian, children, with, european, education, catherine, believed, education, could, change, the, hearts, and, minds, of, the, russian, people, and, turn, them, away, from, backwardness, this, meant, developing, individuals, both, intellectually, and, morally, providing, them, knowledge, and, skills, and, fostering, a, sense, of, civic, responsibility, her, goal, was, to, modernise, education, across, russia, catherine, appointed, ivan, betskoy, as, her, advisor, on, educational, matters, through, him, she, collected, information, from, russia, and, other, countries, about, educational, institutions, she, also, established, a, commission, composed, of, t, n, teplov, t, von, klingstedt, f, g, dilthey, and, the, historian, g, muller, she, consulted, british, pedagogical, pioneers, particularly, the, rev, daniel, dumaresq, and, dr, john, brown, in, 1764, she, sent, for, dumaresq, to, come, to, russia, and, then, appointed, him, to, the, educational, commission, the, commission, studied, the, reform, projects, previously, installed, by, i, i, shuvalov, under, elizabeth, and, under, peter, iii, they, submitted, recommendations, for, the, establishment, of, a, general, system, of, education, for, all, russian, orthodox, subjects, from, the, age, of, 5, to, 18, excluding, serfs, however, no, action, was, taken, on, any, recommendations, put, forth, by, the, commission, due, to, the, calling, of, the, legislative, commission, in, july, 1765, dumaresq, wrote, to, dr, john, brown, about, the, commission, s, problems, and, received, a, long, reply, containing, very, general, and, sweeping, suggestions, for, education, and, social, reforms, in, russia, dr, brown, argued, in, a, democratic, country, education, ought, to, be, under, the, state, s, control, and, based, on, an, education, code, he, also, placed, great, emphasis, on, the, proper, and, effectual, education, of, the, female, sex, two, years, prior, catherine, had, commissioned, ivan, betskoy, to, draw, up, the, general, programme, for, the, education, of, young, people, of, both, sexes, this, work, emphasised, the, fostering, of, the, creation, of, a, new, kind, of, people, raised, in, isolation, from, the, damaging, influence, of, a, backward, russian, environment, the, establishment, of, the, moscow, foundling, home, moscow, orphanage, was, the, first, attempt, at, achieving, that, goal, it, was, charged, with, admitting, destitute, and, extramarital, children, to, educate, them, in, any, way, the, state, deemed, fit, because, the, moscow, foundling, home, was, not, established, as, a, state, funded, institution, it, represented, an, opportunity, to, experiment, with, new, educational, theories, however, the, moscow, foundling, home, was, unsuccessful, mainly, due, to, extremely, high, mortality, rates, which, prevented, many, of, the, children, from, living, long, enough, to, develop, into, the, enlightened, subjects, the, state, desired, not, long, after, the, moscow, foundling, home, at, the, instigation, of, her, factotum, ivan, betskoy, she, wrote, a, manual, for, the, education, of, young, children, drawing, from, the, ideas, of, john, locke, and, founded, the, famous, smolny, institute, in, 1764, first, of, its, kind, in, russia, at, first, the, institute, only, admitted, young, girls, of, the, noble, elite, but, eventually, it, began, to, admit, girls, of, the, petit, bourgeoisie, as, well, the, girls, who, attended, the, smolny, institute, smolyanki, were, often, accused, of, being, ignorant, of, anything, that, went, on, in, the, world, outside, the, walls, of, the, smolny, buildings, within, which, they, acquired, a, proficiency, in, french, music, and, dancing, along, with, a, complete, awe, of, the, monarch, central, to, the, institute, s, philosophy, of, pedagogy, was, strict, enforcement, of, discipline, running, and, games, were, forbidden, and, the, building, was, kept, particularly, cold, because, too, much, warmth, was, believed, to, be, harmful, to, the, developing, body, as, was, excessive, play, from, 1768, to, 1774, no, progress, was, made, in, setting, up, a, national, school, system, however, catherine, continued, to, investigate, the, pedagogical, principles, and, practice, of, other, countries, and, made, many, other, educational, reforms, including, an, overhaul, of, the, cadet, corps, in, 1766, the, corps, then, began, to, take, children, from, a, very, young, age, and, educate, them, until, the, age, of, 21, with, a, broadened, curriculum, that, included, the, sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and, international, law, these, reforms, in, the, cadet, corps, influenced, the, curricula, of, the, naval, cadet, corps, and, the, engineering, and, artillery, schools, following, the, war, and, the, defeat, of, pugachev, catherine, laid, the, obligation, to, establish, schools, at, the, guberniya, a, provincial, subdivision, of, the, russian, empire, ruled, by, a, governor, on, the, boards, of, social, welfare, set, up, with, the, participation, of, elected, representatives, from, the, three, free, estates, by, 1782, catherine, arranged, another, advisory, commission, to, review, the, information, she, had, gathered, on, the, educational, systems, of, many, different, countries, one, system, that, particularly, stood, out, was, produced, by, a, mathematician, franz, aepinus, he, was, strongly, in, favour, of, the, adoption, of, the, austrian, three, tier, model, of, trivial, real, and, normal, schools, at, the, village, town, and, provincial, capital, levels, in, addition, to, the, advisory, commission, catherine, established, a, commission, of, national, schools, under, pyotr, zavadovsky, this, commission, was, charged, with, organising, a, national, school, network, as, well, as, providing, teacher, training, and, textbooks, on, 5, august, 1786, the, russian, statute, of, national, education, was, created, the, statute, established, a, two, tier, network, of, high, schools, and, primary, schools, in, guberniya, capitals, that, were, free, of, charge, open, to, all, of, the, free, classes, not, serfs, and, co, educational, it, also, stipulated, in, detail, the, subjects, to, be, taught, at, every, age, and, the, method, of, teaching, in, addition, to, the, textbooks, translated, by, the, commission, teachers, were, provided, with, the, guide, to, teachers, this, work, divided, into, four, parts, dealt, with, teaching, methods, subject, matter, teacher, conduct, and, school, administration, despite, these, efforts, later, historians, of, the, 19th, century, were, generally, critical, some, claimed, catherine, failed, to, supply, enough, money, to, support, her, educational, program, two, years, after, the, implementation, of, catherine, s, program, a, member, of, the, national, commission, inspected, the, institutions, established, throughout, russia, the, inspectors, encountered, a, patchy, response, while, the, nobility, provided, appreciable, amounts, of, money, for, these, institutions, they, preferred, to, send, their, own, children, to, private, prestigious, institutions, also, the, townspeople, tended, to, turn, against, the, junior, schools, and, their, pedagogical, methods, yet, by, the, end, of, catherine, s, reign, an, estimated, 62, 000, pupils, were, being, educated, in, some, 549, state, institutions, while, a, significant, improvement, it, was, only, a, minuscule, number, compared, to, the, size, of, the, russian, population, catherine, s, apparent, embrace, of, all, things, russian, including, orthodoxy, may, have, prompted, her, personal, indifference, to, religion, she, nationalised, all, of, the, church, lands, to, help, pay, for, her, wars, largely, emptied, the, monasteries, and, forced, most, of, the, remaining, clergymen, to, survive, as, farmers, or, from, fees, for, baptisms, and, other, services, very, few, members, of, the, nobility, entered, the, church, which, became, even, less, important, than, it, had, been, she, did, not, allow, dissenters, to, build, chapels, and, she, suppressed, religious, dissent, after, the, onset, of, the, french, revolution, however, in, accord, with, her, anti, ottoman, policy, catherine, promoted, the, protection, and, fostering, of, christians, under, turkish, rule, she, placed, strictures, on, catholics, ukaz, of, 23, february, 1769, mainly, polish, and, attempted, to, assert, and, extend, state, control, over, them, in, the, wake, of, the, partitions, of, poland, for, example, although, catholic, parishes, were, allowed, to, retain, their, property, and, worship, papal, oversight, of, parishes, was, restricted, to, only, theology, in, its, stead, catherine, appointed, a, catholic, bishop, later, raising, the, position, to, archbishop, of, mohylev, to, administer, all, catholic, churches, in, her, territory, nevertheless, catherine, s, russia, provided, an, asylum, and, a, base, for, regrouping, to, the, jesuits, following, the, suppression, of, the, jesuits, in, most, of, europe, in, 1773, catherine, took, many, different, approaches, to, islam, during, her, reign, she, avoided, force, and, tried, persuasion, and, money, to, integrate, muslim, areas, into, her, empire, between, 1762, and, 1773, muslims, were, prohibited, from, owning, any, orthodox, serfs, they, were, pressured, into, orthodoxy, through, monetary, incentives, catherine, promised, more, serfs, of, all, religions, as, well, as, amnesty, for, convicts, if, muslims, chose, to, convert, to, orthodoxy, however, the, legislative, commission, of, 1767, offered, several, seats, to, people, professing, the, islamic, faith, this, commission, promised, to, protect, their, religious, rights, but, did, not, do, so, many, orthodox, peasants, felt, threatened, by, the, sudden, change, and, burned, mosques, as, a, sign, of, their, displeasure, catherine, chose, to, assimilate, islam, into, the, state, rather, than, eliminate, it, when, public, outcry, became, too, disruptive, after, the, toleration, of, all, faiths, edict, of, 1773, muslims, were, permitted, to, build, mosques, and, practise, all, of, their, traditions, the, most, obvious, of, these, being, the, pilgrimage, to, mecca, which, previously, had, been, denied, catherine, created, the, orenburg, muslim, spiritual, assembly, to, help, regulate, muslim, populated, regions, as, well, as, regulate, the, instruction, and, ideals, of, mullahs, the, positions, on, the, assembly, were, appointed, and, paid, for, by, catherine, and, her, government, as, a, way, of, regulating, religious, affairs, in, 1785, catherine, approved, the, subsidising, of, new, mosques, and, new, town, settlements, for, muslims, this, was, another, attempt, to, organise, and, passively, control, the, outer, fringes, of, her, country, by, building, new, settlements, with, mosques, placed, in, them, catherine, attempted, to, ground, many, of, the, nomadic, people, who, wandered, through, southern, russia, in, 1786, she, assimilated, the, islamic, schools, into, the, russian, public, school, system, under, government, regulation, the, plan, was, another, attempt, to, force, nomadic, people, to, settle, this, allowed, the, russian, government, to, control, more, people, especially, those, who, previously, had, not, fallen, under, the, jurisdiction, of, russian, law, russia, often, treated, judaism, as, a, separate, entity, where, jews, were, maintained, with, a, separate, legal, and, bureaucratic, system, although, the, government, knew, that, judaism, existed, catherine, and, her, advisers, had, no, real, definition, of, what, a, jew, is, because, the, term, meant, many, things, during, her, reign, judaism, was, a, small, if, not, non, existent, religion, in, russia, until, 1772, when, catherine, agreed, to, the, first, partition, of, poland, the, large, new, jewish, element, was, treated, as, a, separate, people, defined, by, their, religion, catherine, separated, the, jews, from, orthodox, society, restricting, them, to, the, pale, of, settlement, she, levied, additional, taxes, on, the, followers, of, judaism, if, a, family, converted, to, the, orthodox, faith, that, additional, tax, was, lifted, jewish, members, of, society, were, required, to, pay, double, the, tax, of, their, orthodox, neighbours, converted, jews, could, gain, permission, to, enter, the, merchant, class, and, farm, as, free, peasants, under, russian, rule, in, an, attempt, to, assimilate, the, jews, into, russia, s, economy, catherine, included, them, under, the, rights, and, laws, of, the, charter, of, the, towns, of, 1782, orthodox, russians, disliked, the, inclusion, of, judaism, mainly, for, economic, reasons, catherine, tried, to, keep, the, jews, away, from, certain, economic, spheres, even, under, the, guise, of, equality, in, 1790, she, banned, jewish, citizens, from, moscow, s, middle, class, in, 1785, catherine, declared, jews, to, be, officially, foreigners, with, foreigners, rights, this, re, established, the, separate, identity, that, judaism, maintained, in, russia, throughout, the, jewish, haskalah, catherine, s, decree, also, denied, jews, the, rights, of, an, orthodox, or, naturalised, citizen, of, russia, taxes, doubled, again, for, those, of, jewish, descent, in, 1794, and, catherine, officially, declared, that, jews, bore, no, relation, to, russians, in, many, ways, the, orthodox, church, fared, no, better, than, its, foreign, counterparts, during, the, reign, of, catherine, under, her, leadership, she, completed, what, peter, iii, had, started, the, church, s, lands, were, expropriated, and, the, budget, of, both, monasteries, and, bishoprics, were, controlled, by, the, collegium, of, accounting, endowments, from, the, government, replaced, income, from, privately, held, lands, the, endowments, were, often, much, less, than, the, original, intended, amount, she, closed, 569, of, 954, monasteries, of, which, only, 161, received, government, money, only, 400, 000, roubles, of, church, wealth, were, paid, back, while, other, religions, such, as, islam, received, invitations, to, the, legislative, commission, the, orthodox, clergy, did, not, receive, a, single, seat, their, place, in, government, was, restricted, severely, during, the, years, of, catherine, s, reign, in, 1762, to, help, mend, the, rift, between, the, orthodox, church, and, a, sect, that, called, themselves, the, old, believers, catherine, passed, an, act, that, allowed, old, believers, to, practice, their, faith, openly, without, interference, while, claiming, religious, tolerance, she, intended, to, recall, the, old, believers, into, the, official, church, they, refused, to, comply, and, in, 1764, she, deported, over, 20, 000, old, believers, to, siberia, on, the, grounds, of, their, faith, in, later, years, catherine, amended, her, thoughts, old, believers, were, allowed, to, hold, elected, municipal, positions, after, the, urban, charter, of, 1785, and, she, promised, religious, freedom, to, those, who, wished, to, settle, in, russia, religious, education, was, reviewed, strictly, at, first, she, attempted, to, revise, clerical, studies, proposing, a, reform, of, religious, schools, this, reform, never, progressed, beyond, the, planning, stages, by, 1786, catherine, excluded, all, religion, and, clerical, studies, programs, from, lay, education, by, separating, the, public, interests, from, those, of, the, church, catherine, began, a, secularisation, of, the, day, to, day, workings, of, russia, she, transformed, the, clergy, from, a, group, that, wielded, great, power, over, the, russian, government, and, its, people, to, a, segregated, community, forced, to, depend, on, the, state, for, compensation, catherine, throughout, her, long, reign, took, many, lovers, often, elevating, them, to, high, positions, for, as, long, as, they, held, her, interest, and, then, pensioning, them, off, with, gifts, of, serfs, and, large, estates, the, percentage, of, state, money, spent, on, the, court, increased, from, 10, in, 1767, to, 11, in, 1781, to, 14, in, 1795, catherine, gave, away, 66, 000, serfs, from, 1762, to, 1772, 202, 000, from, 1773, to, 1793, and, 100, 000, in, one, day, 18, august, 1795, 119, catherine, bought, the, support, of, the, bureaucracy, in, 1767, catherine, decreed, that, after, seven, years, in, one, rank, civil, servants, automatically, would, be, promoted, regardless, of, office, or, merit, after, her, affair, with, her, lover, and, adviser, grigory, potemkin, ended, in, 1776, he, allegedly, selected, a, candidate, lover, for, her, who, had, the, physical, beauty, and, mental, faculties, to, hold, her, interest, such, as, alexander, dmitriev, mamonov, and, nicholas, alexander, suk, some, of, these, men, loved, her, in, return, and, she, always, showed, generosity, towards, them, even, after, the, affair, ended, one, of, her, lovers, pyotr, zavadovsky, received, 50, 000, roubles, a, pension, of, 5, 000, roubles, and, 4, 000, peasants, in, ukraine, after, she, dismissed, him, in, 1777, the, last, of, her, lovers, platon, zubov, was, 40, years, her, junior, her, sexual, independence, led, to, many, of, the, legends, about, her, catherine, kept, her, illegitimate, son, by, grigory, orlov, alexis, bobrinsky, later, elevated, to, count, bobrinsky, by, paul, i, near, tula, away, from, her, court, the, acceptance, of, a, woman, ruler, was, more, of, an, issue, among, elites, in, western, europe, than, in, russia, the, british, ambassador, to, russia, james, harris, reported, back, to, london, that, her, majesty, has, a, masculine, force, of, mind, obstinacy, in, adhering, to, a, plan, and, intrepidity, in, the, execution, of, it, but, she, wants, the, more, manly, virtues, of, deliberation, forbearance, in, prosperity, and, accuracy, of, judgment, while, she, possesses, in, a, high, degree, the, weaknesses, vulgarly, attributed, to, her, sex, love, of, flattery, and, its, inseparable, companion, vanity, an, inattention, to, unpleasant, but, salutary, advice, and, a, propensity, to, voluptuousness, which, leads, to, excesses, that, would, debase, a, female, character, in, any, sphere, of, life, sir,
