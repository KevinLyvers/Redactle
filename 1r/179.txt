be, the, villa, godi, begun, 1537, this, design, already, showed, the, originality, of, palladio, s, conception, a, central, block, is, flanked, by, two, wings, the, central, block, is, recessed, and, the, two, wings, are, advanced, and, more, prominent, inside, the, central, block, the, piano, nobile, or, main, floor, opened, onto, a, loggia, with, a, triple, arcade, reached, by, a, central,

framed, by, classical, columns, in, the, hall, of, the, muses, of, the, villa, godi, in, the, 1550s, in, his, early, works, in, vicenza, in, the, 1540s, he, sometimes, emulated, the, work, of, his, predecessor, giulio, romano, but, in, doing, so, he, added, his, own, ideas, and, variations, an, example, was, the, palazzo, thiene, in, vicenza, which, romano, had, begun, but, which, after, romano, s, death, palladio, completed, it, was, his, first, construction, of, a, large, townhouse, he, used, romano, s, idea, for, windows, framed, by, stone, corbeaux, a, ladder, of, stone, blocks, but, palladio, gave, the, heavy, facade, a, new, lightness, and, grace, several, other, villas, of, this, time, are, attributed, to, palladio, including, the, villa, piovene, 1539, and, villa, pisani, 1542, of, the, villa, pisani, only, the, central, structure, of, the, original, plan, remains, the, loggia, is, opened, by, three, arcades, beneath, a, frieze, beneath, a, pediment, the, interior, of, the, main, hall, has, a, barrel, vaulted, ceiling, lavishly, decorated, with, murals, of, mythological, themes, one, of, the, most, important, works, of, his, early, vicenza, period, is, the, basilica, palladiana, in, vicenza, 1546, the, palace, of, the, city, government, palladio, called, it, basilica, explaining, that, the, functions, and, form, of, a, modern, city, hall, resembled, those, of, an, ancient, roman, basilica, he, did, not, construct, the, building, from, the, ground, up, but, added, two, story, loggias, to, the, exterior, of, an, older, building, which, had, been, finished, in, 1459, for, the, facade, palladio, made, use, of, two, levels, of, arcades, with, rounded, arches, and, columns, which, opened, the, exterior, of, the, building, to, the, interior, courtyard, the, arcades, were, divided, by, columns, and, small, circular, windows, oculi, with, a, variety, and, richness, of, decorative, detail, the, building, was, not, completed, until, 1617, after, palladio, s, death, its, design, had, a, notable, influence, on, many, buildings, across, europe, from, portugal, to, germany, palazzo, chiericati, begun, in, 1550, was, another, urban, palace, built, on, a, city, square, near, the, port, in, vicenza, it, was, constructed, after, the, palazzo, della, ragione, but, it, was, very, different, in, its, plan, and, decoration, the, two, story, facade, with, a, double, loggia, was, divided, into, eleven, spaces, by, rows, of, doric, columns, while, a, doric, cornice, separated, the, lower, level, from, the, more, important, piano, nobile, above, the, original, plan, of, palladio, had, the, upper, level, identical, to, the, lower, level, but, the, owners, wanted, more, space, for, ceremonies, so, the, central, section, on, the, piano, nobile, was, brought, forward, and, given, windows, with, decorative, frontons, doubling, the, interior, space, the, palazzo, del, capitaniato, the, offices, of, the, venetian, governor, of, the, region, is, a, later, variation, on, the, urban, palace, built, in, vicenza, facing, the, basilica, palladiana, and, the, finest, of, his, late, urban, palaces, the, four, brick, half, columns, on, the, facade, give, a, strong, element, of, verticality, carefully, balanced, by, the, horizontal, balustrades, on, the, piano, nobile, and, on, the, projecting, cornice, at, the, top, the, red, brick, of, the, walls, and, columns, and, the, white, stone, of, the, balustrades, and, bases, of, the, columns, give, another, contrast, the, facade, was, later, given, stucco, sculptural, decoration, in, the, mannerist, style, which, has, considerably, deteriorated, the, success, of, the, basilica, palladiana, propelled, palladio, into, the, top, ranks, of, the, architects, of, northern, italy, he, had, travelled, to, rome, in, 1549, hoping, to, become, a, papal, architect, but, the, death, of, pope, paul, iii, ended, that, ambition, his, patron, gian, giorgio, trissino, died, in, 1550, but, in, the, same, year, palladio, gained, a, new, supporter, the, powerful, venetian, aristocrat, daniele, barbaro, through, barbaro, he, became, known, to, the, major, aristocratic, families, of, northern, italy, in, addition, to, the, barbaros, the, aristocratic, cornaro, foscari, and, pisani, families, supported, palladio, s, career, while, he, continued, to, construct, a, series, of, magnificent,

architettura, the, four, books, of, architecture, in, venice, these, books, reprinted, in, different, languages, and, circulated, widely, in, europe, secured, his, reputation, as, the, most, influential, figure, in, the, renewal, of, classical, architecture, a, reputation, which, only, continued, to, grow, after, his, death, the, type, of, villa, invented, by, palladio, at, the, villa,

1687, and, were, not, part, of, palladio, s, plan, the, building, was, especially, influential, particularly, in, england, and, the, united, states, where, it, inspired, neo, palladianist, buildings, such, as, mereworth, castle, 1724, in, kent, and, thomas, jefferson, s, monticello, in, virginia, 1772, villa, foscari, also, known, as, la, malcontenta, for, the, name, of, the, suburban, village,

his, first, project, in, venice, was, the, cloister, of, the, church, of, santa, maria, della, carit, 1560, 1561, followed, by, the, refectory, and, then, the, interior, of, the, san, giorgio,

to, refine, simplify, and, use, them, in, innovative, ways, the, style, of, palladio, employed, a, classical, repertoire, of, elements, in, new, ways, he, clearly, expressed, the, function, of, each, part, of, the, building, by, its, form, particularly, elevating, and, giving, precedence, to, the, piano, nobile, the, ceremonial, floor, of, his, villas, and, palaces, as, much, as, possible, he, simplified, the, forms, as, he, did, at, villa, capra, la, rotonda, surrounding, a, circular, dome, and, interior, with, perfectly, square, facades, and, placing, the, building, pedestal, to, be, more, visible, and, more, dramatic, palladio, was, inspired, by, classical, roman, architecture, but, he, did, not, slavishly, imitate, it, he, chose, elements, and, assembled, them, in, innovative, ways, appropriate, to, the, site, and, function, of, the, building, his, buildings, were, often, placed, on, pedestals, raising, them, and, making, them, more, visible, and, so, they, could, offer, a, view, the, villas, very, often, had, loggias, covered, arcades, or, walkways, on, the, outside, of, upper, levels, which, gave, a, view, of, the, scenery, or, city, below, and, also, gave, variety, to, the, facade, when, he, designed, his, rustic, villas, and, suburban, villas, he, paid, particular, attention, to, the, site, integrating, them, as, much, as, possible, into, nature, either, by, sites, on, hilltops, or, looking, out, at, gardens, or, rivers, the, serlian, window, or, venetian, window, also, known, as, a, palladian, window, was, another, common, feature, of, his, style, which, he, used, both, for, windows, and, the, arches, of, the, loggias, of, his, buildings, it, consists, of, an, arched, window, flanked, by, two, smaller, square, windows, divided, by, two, columns, or, pilasters, and, often, topped, by, a, small, entablature, and, by, a, small, circular, window, or, hole, called, an, oculus, these, particular, features, originally, appeared, in, the, triumphal, arches, of, rome, and, had, been, used, in, the, earlier, renaissance, by, bramante, but, palladio, used, them, in, novel, ways, particularly, in, the, facade, of, the, basilica, palladiana, and, in, the, villa, pojana, they, also, became, a, common, feature, of, later, palladian, buildings, in, england, and, elsewhere, in, his, later, work, particularly, the, palazzo, valmarana, and, the, palazzo, del, capitaniato, in, vicenza, his, style, became, more, ornate, and, more, decorative, with, more, sculptural, decoration, on, the, facade, tending, toward, mannerism, his, buildings, in, this, period, were, examples, of, the, transition, beginning, to, what, would, become, baroque, architecture, palladio, s, architecture, was, not, dependent, on, expensive, materials, which, must, have, been, an, advantage, to, his, more, financially, pressed, clients, many, of, his, buildings, are, of, brick, covered, with, stucco, stuccoed, brickwork, was, always, used, in, his, villa, designs, in, order, to, give, the, appearance, of, a, classical, roman, structure, his, success, as, an, architect, is, based, not, only, on, the, beauty, of, his, work, but, also, on, its, harmony, with, the, culture, of, his, time, his, success, and, influence, came, from, the, integration, of, extraordinary, aesthetic, quality, with, expressive, characteristics, that, resonated, with, his, clients, social, aspirations, his, buildings, served, to, communicate, visually, their, place, in, the, social, order, of, their, culture, this, powerful, integration, of, beauty, and, the, physical, representation, of, social, meanings, is, apparent, in, three, major, building, types, the, urban, palazzo, the, agricultural, villa, and, the, church, relative, to, his, trips, to, rome, palladio, developed, three, main, palace, types, by, 1556, in, 1550, the, palazzo, chiericati, was, completed, the, proportions, for, the, building, were, based, on, musical, ratios, for, adjacent, rooms, the, building, was, centralized, by, a, tripartite, division, of, a, series, of, columns, or, colonnades, in, 1552, the, palazzo, porto, located, in, vicenza, was, rebuilt, incorporating, the, roman, renaissance, element, for, fa, ades, a, colonnade, of, corinthian, columns, surrounded, a, main, court, the, palazzo, antonini, in, udine, constructed, in, 1556, had, a, centralized, hall, with, four, columns, and, service, spaces, placed, relatively, toward, one, side, he, used, styles, of, incorporating, the, six, columns, supported, by, pediments, into, the, walls, as, part, of, the, fa, ade, this, technique, had, been, applied, in, his, villa, designs, as, well, palladio, experimented, with, the, plan, of, the, palazzo, porto, by, incorporating, it, into, the, palazzo, thiene, it, was, an, earlier, project, from, 1545, to, 1550, and, remained, uncompleted, due, to, elaborate, elevations, in, his, designs, he, used, mannerist, elements, such, as, stucco, surface, reliefs, and, large, columns, often, extending, two, stories, high, in, his, urban, structures, he, developed, a, new, improved, version, of, the, typical, early, renaissance, palazzo, exemplified, by, the, palazzo, strozzi, adapting, a, new, urban, palazzo, type, created, by, bramante, in, the, house, of, raphael, palladio, found, a, powerful, expression, of, the, importance, of, the, owner, and, his, social, position, the, main, living, quarters, of, the, owner, on, the, second, level, were, clearly, distinguished, in, importance, by, the, use, of, a, pedimented, classical, portico, centred, and, raised, above, the, subsidiary, and, utilitarian, ground, level, illustrated, in, the, palazzo, porto, and, the, palazzo, valmarana, the, tallness, of, the, portico, was, achieved, by, incorporating, the, owner, s, sleeping, quarters, on, the, third, level, within, a, giant, two, story, classical, colonnade, a, motif, adapted, from, michelangelo, s, capitoline, buildings, in, rome, the, elevated, main, floor, level, became, known, as, the, piano, nobile, and, is, still, referred, to, as, the, first, floor, in, europe, palladio, also, established, an, influential, new, building, format, for, the, agricultural, villas, of, the, venetian, aristocracy, palladio, s, approach, to, his, villa, designs, was, not, relative, to, his, experience, in, rome, his, designs, were, based, on, practicality, and, employed, few, reliefs, he, consolidated, the, various, stand, alone, farm, outbuildings, into, a, single, impressive, structure, arranged, as, a, highly, organized, whole, dominated, by, a, strong, centre, and, symmetrical, side, wings, as, illustrated, at, villa, barbaro, in, the, project, of, the, villa, barbaro, palladio, most, likely, was, also, engaged, in, the, interior, decoration, alongside, the, painter, paolo, veronese, he, invented, the, complex, and, sophisticated, illusionistic, landscape, paintings, that, cover, the, walls, of, various, rooms, the, villa, capra, la, rotonda, of, 1552, outside, vicenza, was, constructed, as, a, summer, house, with, views, from, all, four, sides, the, plan, has, centralized, circular, halls, with, wings, and, porticos, expanding, on, all, four, sides, palladio, began, to, implement, the, classical, temple, front, into, his, design, of, fa, ades, for, villas, he, felt, that, to, make, an, entry, appear, grand, the, roman, temple, front, would, be, the, most, suitable, style, the, palladian, villa, configuration, often, consists, of, a, centralized, block, raised, on, an, elevated, podium, accessed, by, grand, steps, and, flanked, by, lower, service, wings, as, at, villa, foscari, and, villa, badoer, this, format, with, the, quarters, of, the, owners, at, the, elevated, centre, of, their, own, world, found, resonance, as, a, prototype, for, italian, villas, and, later, for, the, country, estates, of, the, british, nobility, such, as, lord, burlington, s, chiswick, house, vanbrugh, s, blenheim, walpole, s, houghton, hall, and, adam, s, kedleston, hall, and, paxton, house, in, scotland, his, villas, were, used, by, a, capitalist, gentry, who, developed, an, interest, in, agriculture, and, land, the, configuration, was, a, perfect, architectural, expression, of, their, worldview, clearly, expressing, their, perceived, position, in, the, social, order, of, the, times, his, influence, was, extended, worldwide, into, the, british, colonies, palladio, developed, his, own, prototype, for, the, plan, of, the, villas, that, was, flexible, to, moderate, in, scale, and, function, the, palladian, villa, format, was, easily, adapted, for, a, democratic, worldview, as, may, be, seen, in, thomas, jefferson, s, monticello, and, his, arrangement, for, the, university, of, virginia, it, also, may, be, seen, applied, as, recently, as, 1940, in, pope, s, national, gallery, in, washington, d, c, where, the, public, entry, to, the, world, of, high, culture, occupies, the, exalted, centre, position, the, rustication, of, exposed, basement, walls, of, victorian, residences, is, a, late, remnant, of, the, palladian, format, clearly, expressed, as, a, podium, for, the, main, living, space, for, the, family, similarly, palladio, created, a, new, configuration, for, the, design, of, catholic, churches, that, established, two, interlocking, architectural, orders, each, clearly, articulated, yet, delineating, a, hierarchy, of, a, larger, order, overriding, a, lesser, order, this, idea, was, in, direct, coincidence, with, the, rising, acceptance, of, the, theological, ideas, of, st, thomas, aquinas, who, postulated, the, notion, of, two, worlds, existing, simultaneously, the, divine, world, of, faith, and, the, earthly, world, of, humans, palladio, created, an, architecture, which, made, a, visual, statement, communicating, the, idea, of, two, superimposed, systems, as, illustrated, at, san, francesco, della, vigna, in, a, time, when, religious, dominance, in, western, culture, was, threatened, by, the, rising, power, of, science, and, secular, humanists, this, architecture, found, great, favor, with, the, catholic, church, as, a, clear, statement, of, the, proper, relationship, of, the, earthly, and, the, spiritual, worlds, aside, from, palladio, s, designs, his, publications, further, contributed, to, palladianism, during, the, second, half, of, his, life, palladio, published, many, books, on, architecture, most, famously, i, quattro, libri, dell, architettura, the, four, books, of, architecture, venice, 1570, note, the, first, date, given, is, the, beginning, of, the, project, not, its, completion
