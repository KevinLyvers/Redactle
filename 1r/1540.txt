casas, was, born, in, seville, on, 11, november, 1484, for, centuries, las, casas, s, birthdate, was, believed, to, be, 1474, however, in, the, 1970s, scholars, conducting, archival, work, demonstrated, this, to, be, an, error, after, uncovering, in, the, archivo, general, de, indias, records, of, a, contemporary, lawsuit, that, demonstrated, he, was, born, a, decade, later, than, had, been, supposed, subsequent, biographers, and, authors, have, generally, accepted, and, reflected, this, revision, his, father, pedro, de, las, casas, a, merchant, descended, from, one, of, the, families, that, had, migrated, from, france, to, found, the, christian, seville, his, family, also, spelled, the, name, casaus, according, to, one, biographer, his, family, was, of, converso, heritage, although, others, refer, to, them, as, ancient, christians, who, migrated, from, france, following, the, testimony, of, las, casas, s, biographer, antonio, de, remesal, tradition, has, it, that, las, casas, studied, a, licentiate, at, salamanca, but, las, casas, does, not, say, so, in, his, own, writings, las, casas, s, first, encounter, with, indigenous, peoples, happened, before, he, even, sailed, to, the, americas, in, his, historia, general, de, las, indias, he, wrote, of, christopher, columbus, return, to, seville, in, 1493, las, casas, recorded, having, seen, seven, indians,

injustices, they, saw, committed, by, the, slave, owners, against, the, indians, they, decided, to, deny, slave, owners, the, right, to, confession, las, casas, was, among, those, denied, confession, for, this, reason, in, december, 1511, a, dominican, preacher, fray, antonio, de, montesinos, preached, a, fiery, sermon, that, implicated, the, colonists, in, the, genocide, of, the, native, peoples, he, is, said, to, have, preached, tell, me, by, what, right, of, justice, do, you, hold, these, indians, in, such, a, cruel, and, horrible, servitude, on, what, authority, have, you, waged, such, detestable, wars, against, these, people, who, dealt, quietly, and, peacefully, on, their, own, lands, wars, in, which, you, have, destroyed, such, an, infinite, number, of, them, by, homicides, and, slaughters, never, heard, of, before, why, do, you, keep, them, so, oppressed, and, exhausted, without, giving, them, enough, to, eat, or, curing, them, of, the, sicknesses, they, incur, from, the, excessive, labor, you, give, them, and, they, die, or, rather, you, kill, them, in, order, to, extract, and, acquire, gold, every, day, las, casas, himself, argued, against, the, dominicans, in, favor, of, the, justice, of, the, encomienda, the, colonists, led, by, diego, columbus, dispatched, a, complaint, against, the, dominicans, to, the, king, and, the, dominicans, were, recalled, from, hispaniola, in, 1513, as, a, chaplain, las, casas, participated, in, diego, vel, zquez, de, cu, llar, s, and, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, conquest, of, cuba, he, participated, in, campaigns, at, bayamo,

here, cruelty, on, a, scale, no, living, being, has, ever, seen, or, expects, to, see, las, casas, and, his, friend, pedro, de, la, renter, a, were, awarded, a, joint, encomienda, which, was, rich, in, gold, and, slaves, located, on, the, arimao, river, close, to, cienfuegos, during, the, next, few, years, he, divided, his, time, between, being, a, colonist, and, his, duties, as, an, ordained, priest, in, 1514, las, casas, was, studying, a, passage, in, the, book, ecclesiasticus, sirach, 34, 18, 22, for, a, pentecost, sermon, and, pondering, its, meaning, las, casas, was, finally, convinced, that, all, the, actions, of, the, spanish, in, the, new, world, had, been, illegal, and, that, they, constituted, a, great, injustice, he, made, up, his, mind, to, give, up, his, slaves, and, encomienda, and, started, to, preach, that, other, colonists, should, do, the, same, when, his, preaching, met, with, resistance, he, realized, that, he, would, have, to, go, to, spain, to, fight, there, against, the, enslavement, and, abuse, of, the, native, people, aided, by, pedro, de, c, rdoba, and, accompanied, by, antonio, de, montesinos, he, left, for, spain, in, september, 1515, arriving, in, seville, in, november, las, casas, arrived, in, spain, with, the, plan, of, convincing, the, king, to, end, the, encomienda, system, this, was, easier, thought, than, done, as, most, of, the, people, who, were, in, positions, of, power, were, themselves, either, encomenderos, or, otherwise, profiting, from, the, influx, of, wealth, from, the, indies, in, the, winter, of, 1515, king, ferdinand, lay, ill, in, plasencia, but, las, casas, was, able, to, get, a, letter, of, introduction, to, the, king, from, the, archbishop, of, seville, diego, de, deza, on, christmas, eve, of, 1515, las, casas, met, the, monarch, and, discussed, the, situation, in, the, indies, with, him, the, king, agreed, to, hear, him, out, in, more, detail, at, a, later, date, while, waiting, las, casas, produced, a, report, that, he, presented, to, the, bishop, of, burgos, juan, rodr, guez, de, fonseca, and, secretary, lope, conchillos, who, were, functionaries, in, complete, charge, of, the, royal, policies, regarding, the, indies, both, were, encomenderos, they, were, not, impressed, by, his, account, and, las, casas, had, to, find, a, different, avenue, of, change, he, put, his, faith, in, his, coming, audience, with, the, king, but, it, never, came, for, king, ferdinand, died, on, 25, january, 1516, the, regency, of, castile, passed, on, to, ximenez, cisneros, and, adrian, of, utrecht, who, were, guardians, for, the, under, age, prince, charles, las, casas, was, resolved, to, see, prince, charles, who, resided, in, flanders, but, on, his, way, there, he, passed, madrid, and, delivered, to, the, regents, a, written, account, of, the, situation, in, the, indies, and, his, proposed, remedies, this, was, his, memorial, de, remedios, para, las, indias, of, 1516, in, this, early, work, las, casas, advocated, importing, black, slaves, from, africa, to, relieve, the, suffering, indians, a, stance, he, later, retracted, becoming, an, advocate, for, the, africans, in, the, colonies, as, well, this, shows, that, las, casas, s, first, concern, was, not, to, end, slavery, as, an, institution, but, to, end, the, physical, abuse, and, suffering, of, the, indians, in, keeping, with, the, legal, and, moral, doctrine, of, the, time, las, casas, believed, that, slavery, could, be, justified, if, it, was, the, result, of, just, war, and, at, the, time, he, assumed, that, the, enslavement, of, africans, was, justified, worried, by, las, casas, descriptions, of, the, situation, in, the, indies, cardinal, cisneros, decided, to, send, a, group, of, hieronymite, monks, to, take, over, the, government, of, the, islands, three, hieronymite, monks, luis, de, figueroa, bernardino, de, manzanedo, and, alonso, de, santo, domingo, were, selected, as, commissioners, to, take, over, the, authority, of, the, indies, las, casas, had, a, considerable, part, in, selecting, them, and, writing, the, instructions, under, which, their, new, government, would, be, instated, largely, based, on, las, casas, s, memorial, las, casas, himself, was, granted, the, official, title, of, protector, of, the, indians, and, given, a, yearly, salary, of, one, hundred, pesos, in, this, new, office, las, casas, was, expected, to, serve, as, an, advisor, to, the, new, governors, with, regard, to, indian, issues, to, speak, the, case, of, the, indians, in, court, and, send, reports, back, to, spain, las, casas, and, the, commissioners, traveled, to, santo, domingo, on, separate, ships, and, las, casas, arrived, two, weeks, later, than, the, hieronimytes, during, this, time, the, hieronimytes, had, time, to, form, a, more, pragmatic, view, of, the, situation, than, the, one, advocated, by, las, casas, their, position, was, precarious, as, every, encomendero, on, the, islands, was, fiercely, against, any, attempts, to, curtail, their, use, of, native, labor, consequently, the, commissioners, were, unable, to, take, any, radical, steps, towards, improving, the, situation, of, the, natives, they, did, revoke, some, encomiendas, from, spaniards, especially, those, who, were, living, in, spain, and, not, on, the, islands, themselves, they, even, repossessed, the, encomienda, of, fonseca, the, bishop, of, burgos, they, also, carried, out, an, inquiry, into, the, indian, question, at, which, all, the, encomenderos, asserted, that, the, indians, were, quite, incapable, of, living, freely, without, their, supervision, las, casas, was, disappointed, and, infuriated, when, he, accused, the, hieronymites, of, being, complicit, in, kidnapping, indians, the, relationship, between, las, casas, and, the, commissioners, broke, down, las, casas, had, become, a, hated, figure, by, spaniards, all, over, the, islands, and, he, had, to, seek, refuge, in, the, dominican, monastery, the, dominicans, had, been, the, first, to, indict, the, encomenderos, and, they, continued, to, chastise, them, and, refuse, the, absolution, of, confession, to, slave, owners, and, even, stated, that, priests, who, took, their, confession, were, committing, a, mortal, sin, in, may, 1517, las, casas, was, forced, to, travel, back, to, spain, to, denounce, to, the, regent, the, failure, of, the, hieronymite, reforms, only, after, las, casas, had, left, did, the, hieronymites, begin, to, congregate, indians, into, towns, similar, to, what, las, casas, had, wanted, when, he, arrived, in, spain, his, former, protector, regent, and, cardinal, ximenez, cisneros, was, ill, and, had, become, tired, of, las, casas, s, tenacity, las, casas, resolved, to, meet, instead, with, the, young, king, charles, i, ximenez, died, on, 8, november, and, the, young, king, arrived, in, valladolid, on, 25, november, 1517, las, casas, managed, to, secure, the, support, of, the, king, s, flemish, courtiers, including, the, powerful, chancellor, jean, de, la, sauvage, las, casas, s, influence, turned, the, favor, of, the, court, against, secretary, conchillos, and, bishop, fonseca, sauvage, spoke, highly, of, las, casas, to, the, king, who, appointed, las, casas, and, sauvage, to, write, a, new, plan, for, reforming, the, governmental, system, of, the, indies, las, casas, suggested, a, plan, where, the, encomienda, would, be, abolished, and, indians, would, be, congregated, into, self, governing, townships, to, become, tribute, paying, vassals, of, the, king, he, still, suggested, that, the, loss, of, indian, labor, for, the, colonists, could, be, replaced, by, allowing, importation, of, african, slaves, another, important, part, of, the, plan, was, to, introduce, a, new, kind, of, sustainable, colonization, and, las, casas, advocated, supporting, the, migration, of, spanish, peasants, to, the, indies, where, they, would, introduce, small, scale, farming, and, agriculture, a, kind, of, colonization, that, did, not, rely, on, resource, depletion, and, indian, labor, las, casas, worked, to, recruit, a, large, number, of, peasants, who, would, want, to, travel, to, the, islands, where, they, would, be, given, lands, to, farm, cash, advances, and, the, tools, and, resources, they, needed, to, establish, themselves, there, the, recruitment, drive, was, difficult, and, during, the, process, the, power, relation, shifted, at, court, when, chancellor, sauvage, las, casas, s, main, supporter, unexpectedly, died, in, the, end, a, much, smaller, number, of, peasant, families, were, sent, than, originally, planned, and, they, were, supplied, with, insufficient, provisions, and, no, support, secured, for, their, arrival, those, who, survived, the, journey, were, ill, received, and, had, to, work, hard, even, to, survive, in, the, hostile, colonies, las, casas, was, devastated, by, the, tragic, result, of, his, peasant, migration, scheme, which, he, felt, had, been, thwarted, by, his, enemies, he, decided, instead, to, undertake, a, personal, venture, which, would, not, rely, on, the, support, of, others, and, fought, to, win, a, land, grant, on, the, american, mainland, which, was, in, its, earliest, stage, of, colonization, following, a, suggestion, by, his, friend, and, mentor, pedro, de, c, rdoba, las, casas, petitioned, a, land, grant, to, be, allowed, to, establish, a, settlement, in, northern, venezuela, at, cuman, founded, in, 1515, there, was, already, a, small, franciscan, monastery, in, cumana, and, a, dominican, one, at, chiribichi, but, the, monks, there, were, being, harassed, by, spaniards, operating, slave, raids, from, the, nearby, island, of, cubagua, to, make, the, proposal, palatable, to, the, king, las, casas, had, to, incorporate, the, prospect, of, profits, for, the, royal, treasury, he, suggested, fortifying, the, northern, coast, of, venezuela, establishing, ten, royal, forts, to, protect, the, indians, and, starting, up, a, system, of, trade, in, gold, and, pearls, all, the, indian, slaves, of, the, new, world, should, be, brought, to, live, in, these, towns, and, become, tribute, paying, subjects, to, the, king, to, secure, the, grant, las, casas, had, to, go, through, a, long, court, fight, against, bishop, fonseca, and, his, supporters, gonzalo, de, oviedo, and, bishop, quevedo, of, tierra, firme, las, casas, s, supporters, were, diego, columbus, and, the, new, chancellor, gattinara, las, casas, s, enemies, slandered, him, to, the, king, accusing, him, of, planning, to, escape, with, the, money, to, genoa, or, rome, in, 1520, las, casas, s, concession, was, finally, granted, but, it, was, a, much, smaller, grant, than, he, had, initially, proposed, he, was, also, denied, the, possibilities, of, extracting, gold, and, pearls, which, made, it, difficult, for, him, to, find, investors, for, the, venture, las, casas, committed, himself, to, producing, 15, 000, ducats, of, annual, revenue, increasing, to, 60, 000, after, ten, years, and, to, erecting, three, christian, towns, of, at, least, 40, settlers, each, some, privileges, were, also, granted, to, the, initial, 50, shareholders, in, las, casas, s, scheme, the, king, also, promised, not, to, give, any, encomienda, grants, in, las, casas, s, area, that, said, finding, fifty, men, willing, to, invest, 200, ducats, each, and, three, years, of, unpaid, work, proved, impossible, for, las, casas, he, ended, up, leaving, in, november, 1520, with, just, a, small, group, of, peasants, paying, for, the, venture, with, money, borrowed, from, his, brother, in, law, arriving, in, puerto, rico, in, january, 1521, he, received, the, terrible, news, that, the, dominican, convent, at, chiribichi, had, been, sacked, by, indians, and, that, the, spaniards, of, the, islands, had, launched, a, punitive, expedition, led, by, gonzalo, de, ocampo, into, the, very, heart, of, the, territory, that, las, casas, wanted, to, colonize, peacefully, the, indians, had, been, provoked, to, attack, the, settlement, of, the, monks, because, of, the, repeated, slave, raids, by, spaniards, operating, from, cubagua, as, ocampo, s, ships, began, returning, with, slaves, from, the, land, las, casas, had, been, granted, he, went, to, hispaniola, to, complain, to, the, audiencia, after, several, months, of, negotiations, las, casas, set, sail, alone, the, peasants, he, had, brought, had, deserted, and, he, arrived, in, his, colony, already, ravaged, by, spaniards, las, casas, worked, there, in, adverse, conditions, for, the, following, months, being, constantly, harassed, by, the, spanish, pearl, fishers, of, cubagua, island, who, traded, slaves, for, alcohol, with, the, natives, early, in, 1522, las, casas, left, the, settlement, to, complain, to, the, authorities, while, he, was, gone, the, native, caribs, attacked, the, settlement, of, cuman, burned, it, to, the, ground, and, killed, four, of, las, casas, s, men, he, returned, to, hispaniola, in, january, 1522, and, heard, the, news, of, the, massacre, the, rumours, even, included, him, among, the, dead, to, make, matters, worse, his, detractors, used, the, event, as, evidence, of, the, need, to, pacify, the, indians, using, military, means, devastated, las, casas, reacted, by, entering, the, dominican, monastery, of, santa, cruz, in, santo, domingo, as, a, novice, in, 1522, and, finally, taking, holy, vows, as, a, dominican, friar, in, 1523, there, he, continued, his, theological, studies, being, particularly, attracted, to, thomist, philosophy, he, oversaw, the, construction, of, a, monastery, in, puerto, plata, on, the, north, coast, of, hispaniola, subsequently, serving, as, prior, of, the, convent, in, 1527, he, began, working, on, his, history, of, the, indies, in, which, he, reported, much, of, what, he, had, witnessed, first, hand, in, the, conquest, and, colonization, of, new, spain, in, 1531, he, wrote, a, letter, to, garcia, manrique, count, of, osorno, protesting, again, the, mistreatment, of, the, indians, and, advocating, a, return, to, his, original, reform, plan, of, 1516, in, 1531, a, complaint, was, sent, by, the, encomenderos, of, hispaniola, that, las, casas, was, again, accusing, them, of, mortal, sins, from, the, pulpit, in, 1533, he, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, a, peace, treaty, between, the, spanish, and, the, rebel, ta, no, band, of, chief, enriquillo, in, 1534, las, casas, made, an, attempt, to, travel, to, peru, to, observe, the, first, stages, of, conquest, of, that, region, by, francisco, pizarro, his, party, made, it, as, far, as, panama, but, had, to, turn, back, to, nicaragua, due, to, adverse, weather, lingering, for, a, while, in, the, dominican, convent, of, granada, he, got, into, conflict, with, rodrigo, de, contreras, governor, of, nicaragua, when, las, casas, vehemently, opposed, slaving, expeditions, by, the, governor, in, 1536, las, casas, followed, a, number, of, friars, to, guatemala, where, they, began, to, prepare, to, undertake, a, mission, among, the, maya, indians, they, stayed, in, the, convent, founded, some, years, earlier, by, fray, domingo, betanzos, and, studied, the, k, iche, language, with, bishop, francisco, marroqu, n, before, traveling, into, the, interior, region, called, tuzulutlan, the, land, of, war, in, 1537, also, in, 1536, before, venturing, into, tuzulutlan, las, casas, went, to, oaxaca, mexico, to, participate, in, a, series, of, discussions, and, debates, among, the, bishops, of, the, dominican, and, franciscan, orders, the, two, orders, had, very, different, approaches, to, the, conversion, of, the, indians, the, franciscans, used, a, method, of, mass, conversion, sometimes, baptizing, many, thousands, of, indians, in, a, day, this, method, was, championed, by, prominent, franciscans, such, as, toribio, de, benavente, known, as, motolinia, and, las, casas, made, many, enemies, among, the, franciscans, for, arguing, that, conversions, made, without, adequate, understanding, were, invalid, las, casas, wrote, a, treatise, called, de, unico, vocationis, modo, on, the, only, way, of, conversion, based, on, the, missionary, principles, he, had, used, in, guatemala, motolinia, would, later, be, a, fierce, critic, of, las, casas, accusing, him, of, being, all, talk, and, no, action, when, it, came, to, converting, the, indians, as, a, direct, result, of, the, debates, between, the, dominicans, and, franciscans, and, spurred, on, by, las, casas, s, treatise, pope, paul, iii, promulgated, the, bull, sublimis, deus, which, stated, that, the, indians, were, rational, beings, and, should, be, brought, peacefully, to, the, faith, as, such, las, casas, returned, to, guatemala, in, 1537, wanting, to, employ, his, new, method, of, conversion, based, on, two, principles, 1, to, preach, the, gospel, to, all, men, and, treat, them, as, equals, and, 2, to, assert, that, conversion, must, be, voluntary, and, based, on, knowledge, and, understanding, of, the, faith, it, was, important, for, las, casas, that, this, method, be, tested, without, meddling, from, secular, colonists, so, he, chose, a, territory, in, the, heart, of, guatemala, where, there, were, no, previous, colonies, and, where, the, natives, were, considered, fierce, and, war, like, because, the, land, had, not, been, possible, to, conquer, by, military, means, the, governor, of, guatemala, alonso, de, maldonado, agreed, to, sign, a, contract, promising, that, if, the, venture, was, successful, he, would, not, establish, any, new, encomiendas, in, the, area, las, casas, s, group, of, friars, established, a, dominican, presence, in, rabinal, sacapulas, and, cob, n, through, the, efforts, of, las, casas, s, missionaries, the, so, called, land, of, war, came, to, be, called, verapaz, true, peace, las, casas, s, strategy, was, to, teach, christian, songs, to, merchant, indian, christians, who, then, ventured, into, the, area, in, this, way, he, was, successful, in, converting, several, native, chiefs, among, them, those, of, atitl, n, and, chichicastenango, and, in, building, several, churches, in, the, territory, named, alta, verapaz, these, congregated, a, group, of, christian, indians, in, the, location, of, what, is, now, the, town, of, rabinal, in, 1538, las, casas, was, recalled, from, his, mission, by, bishop, marroqu, n, who, wanted, him, to, go, to, mexico, and, then, on, to, spain, to, seek, more, dominicans, to, assist, in, the, mission, las, casas, left, guatemala, for, mexico, where, he, stayed, for, more, than, a, year, before, setting, out, for, spain, in, 1540, in, spain, las, casas, started, securing, official, support, for, the, guatemalan, mission, and, he, managed, to, get, a, royal, decree, forbidding, secular, intrusion, into, the, verapaces, for, the, following, five, years, he, also, informed, the, theologians, of, salamanca, led, by, francisco, de, vitoria, of, the, mass, baptism, practiced, by, the, franciscans, resulting, in, a, dictum, condemning, the, practice, as, sacrilegious, but, apart, from, the, clerical, business, las, casas, had, also, traveled, to, spain, for, his, own, purpose, to, continue, the, struggle, against, the, colonists, mistreatment, of, the, indians, the, encomienda, had, in, fact, legally, been, abolished, in, 1523, but, it, had, been, reinstituted, in, 1526, and, in, 1530, a, general, ordinance, against, slavery, was, reversed, by, the, crown, for, this, reason, it, was, a, pressing, matter, for, bartolom, de, las, casas, to, plead, once, again, for, the, indians, with, charles, v, who, was, by, now, holy, roman, emperor, and, no, longer, a, boy, he, wrote, a, letter, asking, for, permission, to, stay, in, spain, a, little, longer, to, argue, for, the, emperor, that, conversion, and, colonization, were, best, achieved, by, peaceful, means, when, the, hearings, started, in, 1542, las, casas, presented, a, narrative, of, atrocities, against, the, natives, of, the, indies, that, would, later, be, published, in, 1552, as, a, short, account, of, the, destruction, of, the, indies, before, a, council, consisting, of, cardinal, garc, a, de, loaysa, the, count, of, osorno, bishop, fuenleal, and, several, members, of, the, council, of, the, indies, las, casas, argued, that, the, only, solution, to, the, problem, was, to, remove, all, indians, from, the, care, of, secular, spaniards, by, abolishing, the, encomienda, system, and, putting, them, instead, directly, under, the, crown, as, royal, tribute, paying, subjects, on, 20, november, 1542, the, emperor, signed, the, new, laws, abolishing, the, encomiendas, and, removing, certain, officials, from, the, council, of, the, indies, the, new, laws, made, it, illegal, to, use, indians, as, carriers, except, where, no, other, transport, was, available, it, prohibited, all, taking, of, indians, as, slaves, and, it, instated, a, gradual, abolition, of, the, encomienda, system, with, each, encomienda, reverting, to, the, crown, at, the, death, of, its, holders, it, also, exempted, the, few, surviving, indians, of, hispaniola, cuba, puerto, rico, and, jamaica, from, tribute, and, all, requirements, of, personal, service, however, the, reforms, were, so, unpopular, in, the, new, world, that, riots, broke, out, and, threats, were, made, against, las, casas, s, life, the, viceroy, of, new, spain, himself, an, encomendero, decided, not, to, implement, the, laws, in, his, domain, and, instead, sent, a, party, to, spain, to, argue, against, the, laws, on, behalf, of, the, encomenderos, las, casas, himself, was, also, not, satisfied, with, the, laws, as, they, were, not, drastic, enough, and, the, encomienda, system, was, going, to, function, for, many, years, still, under, the, gradual, abolition, plan, he, drafted, a, suggestion, for, an, amendment, arguing, that, the, laws, against, slavery, were, formulated, in, such, a, way, that, it, presupposed, that, violent, conquest, would, still, be, carried, out, and, he, encouraged, once, again, beginning, a, phase, of, peaceful, colonization, by, peasants, instead, of, soldiers, before, las, casas, returned, to, spain, he, was, also, appointed, as, bishop, of, chiapas, a, newly, established, diocese, of, which, he, took, possession, in, 1545, upon, his, return, to, the, new, world, he, was, consecrated, in, the, dominican, church, of, san, pablo, on, 30, march, 1544, as, archbishop, loaysa, strongly, disliked, las, casas, the, ceremony, was, officiated, by, loaysa, s, nephew, diego, de, loaysa, bishop, of, modru, with, pedro, torres, titular, bishop, of, arbanum, and, crist, bal, de, pedraza, bishop, of, comayagua, as, co, consecrators, as, a, bishop, las, casas, was, involved, in, frequent, conflicts, with, the, encomenderos, and, secular, laity, of, his, diocese, among, the, landowners, there, was, the, conquistador, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, in, a, pastoral, letter, issued, on, 20, march, 1545, las, casas, refused, absolution, to, slave, owners, and, encomenderos, even, on, their, death, bed, unless, all, their, slaves, had, been, set, free, and, their, property, returned, to, them, las, casas, furthermore, threatened, that, anyone, who, mistreated, indians, within, his, jurisdiction, would, be, excommunicated, he, also, came, into, conflict, with, the, bishop, of, guatemala, francisco, marroqu, n, to, whose, jurisdiction, the, diocese, had, previously, belonged, to, las, casas, s, dismay, bishop, marroqu, n, openly, defied, the, new, laws, while, bishop, las, casas, was, the, principal, consecrator, of, antonio, de, valdivieso, bishop, of, nicaragua, 1544, the, new, laws, were, finally, repealed, on, 20, october, 1545, and, riots, broke, out, against, las, casas, with, shots, being, fired, against, him, by, angry, colonists, after, a, year, he, had, made, himself, so, unpopular, among, the, spaniards, of, the, area, that, he, had, to, leave, having, been, summoned, to, a, meeting, among, the, bishops, of, new, spain, to, be, held, in, mexico, city, on, 12, january, 1546, he, left, his, diocese, never, to, return, at, the, meeting, probably, after, lengthy, reflection, and, realizing, that, the, new, laws, were, lost, in, mexico, las, casas, presented, a, moderated, view, on, the, problems, of, confession, and, restitution, of, property, archbishop, juan, de, zum, rraga, of, mexico, and, bishop, juli, n, garc, s, of, puebla, agreed, completely, with, his, new, moderate, stance, bishop, vasco, de, quiroga, of, michoac, n, had, minor, reservations, and, bishops, francisco, marroqu, n, of, guatemala, and, juan, lopez, de, z, rate, of, oaxaca, did, not, object, this, resulted, in, a, new, resolution, to, be, presented, to, viceroy, mendoza, his, last, act, as, bishop, of, chiapas, was, writing, a, confesionario, a, manual, for, the, administration, of, the, sacrament, of, confession, in, his, diocese, still, refusing, absolution, to, unrepentant, encomenderos, las, casas, appointed, a, vicar, for, his, diocese, and, set, out, for, europe, in, december, 1546, arriving, in, lisbon, in, april, 1547, and, in, spain, on, november, 1547, las, casas, returned, to, spain, leaving, behind, many, conflicts, and, unresolved, issues, arriving, in, spain, he, was, met, by, a, barrage, of, accusations, many, of, them, based, on, his, confesionario, and, its, 12, rules, which, many, of, his, opponents, found, to, be, in, essence, a, denial, of, the, legitimacy, of, spanish, rule, of, its, colonies, and, hence, a, form, of, treason, the, crown, had, for, example, received, a, fifth, of, the, large, number, of, slaves, taken, in, the, recent, mixt, n, war, and, so, could, not, be, held, clean, of, guilt, under, las, casas, s, strict, rules, in, 1548, the, crown, decreed, that, all, copies, of, las, casas, s, confesionario, be, burnt, and, his, franciscan, adversary, motolinia, obliged, and, sent, back, a, report, to, spain, las, casas, defended, himself, by, writing, two, treatises, on, the, just, title, arguing, that, the, only, legality, with, which, the, spaniards, could, claim, titles, over, realms, in, the, new, world, was, through, peaceful, proselytizing, all, warfare, was, illegal, and, unjust, and, only, through, the, papal, mandate, of, peacefully, bringing, christianity, to, heathen, peoples, could, just, titles, be, acquired, as, a, part, of, las, casas, s, defense, by, offense, he, had, to, argue, against, juan, gin, s, de, sep, lveda, sep, lveda, was, a, doctor, of, theology, and, law, who, in, his, book, democrates, alter, sive, de, justis, causis, apud, indos, another, democrates, or, a, new, democrates, or, on, the, just, causes, of, war, against, the, indians, had, argued, that, some, native, peoples, were, incapable, of, ruling, themselves, and, should, be, pacified, forcefully, the, book, was, deemed, unsound, for, publication, by, the, theologians, of, salamanca, and, alcal, for, containing, unsound, doctrine, but, the, pro, encomendero, faction, seized, on, sep, lveda, as, their, intellectual, champion, to, settle, the, issues, a, formal, debate, was, organized, the, famous, valladolid, debate, which, took, place, in, 1550, 51, with, sep, lveda, and, las, casas, each, presenting, their, arguments, in, front, of, a, council, of, jurists, and, theologians, first, sep, lveda, read, the, conclusions, of, his, democrates, alter, and, then, the, council, listened, to, las, casas, read, his, counterarguments, in, the, form, of, an, apolog, a, sep, lveda, argued, that, the, subjugation, of, certain, indians, was, warranted, because, of, their, sins, against, natural, law, that, their, low, level, of, civilization, required, civilized, masters, to, maintain, social, order, that, they, should, be, made, christian, and, that, this, in, turn, required, them, to, be, pacified, and, that, only, the, spanish, could, defend, weak, indians, against, the, abuses, of, the, stronger, ones, las, casas, countered, that, the, scriptures, did, not, in, fact, support, war, against, all, heathens, only, against, certain, canaanite, tribes, that, the, indians, were, not, at, all, uncivilized, nor, lacking, social, order, that, peaceful, mission, was, the, only, true, way, of, converting, the, natives, and, finally, that, some, weak, indians, suffering, at, the, hands, of, stronger, ones, was, preferable, to, all, indians, suffering, at, the, hands, of, spaniards, the, judge, fray, domingo, de, soto, summarised, the, arguments, sep, lveda, addressed, las, casas, s, arguments, with, twelve, refutations, which, were, again, countered, by, las, casas, the, judges, then, deliberated, on, the, arguments, presented, for, several, months, before, coming, to, a, verdict, the, verdict, was, inconclusive, and, both, debaters, claimed, that, they, had, won, sep, lveda, s, arguments, contributed, to, the, policy, of, war, by, fire, and, blood, that, the, third, mexican, provincial, council, implemented, in, 1585, during, the, chichimeca, war, according, to, lewis, hanke, while, sep, lveda, became, the, hero, of, the, conquistadors, his, success, was, short, lived, and, his, works, were, never, published, in, spain, again, during, his, lifetime, las, casas, s, ideas, had, a, more, lasting, impact, on, the, decisions, of, the, king, philip, ii, as, well, as, on, history, and, human, rights, las, casas, s, criticism, of, the, encomienda, system, contributed, to, its, replacement, with, reducciones, his, testimonies, on, the, peaceful, nature, of, the, native, americans, also, encouraged, nonviolent, policies, concerning, the, religious, conversions, of, the, indians, in, new, spain, and, peru, it, also, helped, convince, more, missionaries, to, come, to, the, americas, to, study, the, indigenous, people, such, as, bernardino, de, sahag, n, who, learned, the, native, languages, to, discover, more, about, their, cultures, and, civilizations, the, impact, of, las, casas, s, doctrine, was, also, limited, in, 1550, the, king, had, ordered, that, the, conquest, should, cease, because, the, valladolid, debate, was, to, decide, whether, the, war, was, just, or, not, the, government, s, orders, were, hardly, respected, conquistadors, such, as, pedro, de, valdivia, went, on, to, wage, war, in, chile, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1550s, expanding, the, spanish, territory, in, the, new, world, was, allowed, again, in, may, 1556, and, a, decade, later, spain, started, its, conquest, of, the, philippines, having, resigned, the, bishopric, of, chiapas, las, casas, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, working, closely, with, the, imperial, court, in, matters, relating, to, the, indies, in, 1551, he, rented, a, cell, at, the, college, of, san, gregorio, where, he, lived, with, his, assistant, and, friend, fray, rodrigo, de, ladrada, he, continued, working, as, a, kind, of, procurator, for, the, natives, of, the, indies, many, of, whom, directed, petitions, to, him, to, speak, to, the, emperor, on, their, behalf, sometimes, indigenous, nobility, even, related, their, cases, to, him, in, spain, for, example, the, nahua, noble, francisco, tenamaztle, from, nochistl, n, his, influence, at, court, was, so, great, that, some, even, considered, that, he, had, the, final, word, in, choosing, the, members, of, the, council, of, the, indies, in, 1552, las, casas, published, a, short, account, of, the, destruction, of, the, indies, this, book, written, a, decade, earlier, and, sent, to, the, attention, of, then, prince, philip, ii, of, spain, contained, accounts, of, the, abuses, committed, by, some, spaniards, against, native, americans, during, the, early, stages, of, colonization, in, 1555, his, old, franciscan, adversary, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, wrote, a, letter, in, which, he, described, las, casas, as, an, ignorant, arrogant, troublemaker, benavente, described, indignantly, how, las, casas, had, once, denied, baptism, to, an, aging, indian, who, had, walked, many, leagues, to, receive, it, only, on, the, grounds, that, he, did, not, believe, that, the, man, had, received, sufficient, doctrinal, instruction, this, letter, which, reinvoked, the, old, conflict, over, the, requirements, for, the, sacrament, of, baptism, between, the, two, orders, was, intended, to, bring, las, casas, in, disfavour, however, it, did, not, succeed, one, matter, in, which, he, invested, much, effort, was, the, political, situation, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, in, peru, power, struggles, between, conquistadors, and, the, viceroy, became, an, open, civil, war, in, which, the, conquistadors, led, by, gonzalo, pizarro, rebelled, against, the, new, laws, and, defeated, and, executed, the, viceroy, blasco, n, ez, vela, in, 1546, the, emperor, sent, pedro, de, la, gasca, a, friend, of, las, casas, to, reinstate, the, rule, of, law, and, he, in, turn, defeated, pizarro, to, restabilize, the, political, situation, the, encomenderos, started, pushing, not, only, for, the, repeal, of, the, new, laws, but, for, turning, the, encomiendas, into, perpetual, patrimony, of, the, encomenderos, the, worst, possible, outcome, from, las, casas, s, point, of, view, the, encomenderos, offered, to, buy, the, rights, to, the, encomiendas, from, the, crown, and, charles, v, was, inclined, to, accept, since, his, wars, had, left, him, in, deep, economic, troubles, las, casas, worked, hard, to, convince, the, emperor, that, it, would, be, a, bad, economic, decision, that, it, would, return, the, viceroyalty, to, the, brink, of, open, rebellion, and, could, result, in, the, crown, losing, the, colony, entirely, the, emperor, probably, because, of, the, doubts, caused, by, las, casas, s, arguments, never, took, a, final, decision, on, the, issue, of, the, encomiendas, in, 1561, he, finished, his, historia, de, las, indias, and, signed, it, over, to, the, college, of, san, gregorio, stipulating, that, it, could, not, be, published, until, after, forty, years, in, fact, it, was, not, published, for, 314, years, until, 1875, he, also, had, to, repeatedly, defend, himself, against, accusations, of, treason, someone, possibly, sep, lveda, denounced, him, to, the, spanish, inquisition, but, nothing, came, from, the, case, las, casas, also, appeared, as, a, witness, in, the, case, of, the, inquisition, for, his, friend, archbishop, bartolom, carranza, de, miranda, who, had, been, falsely, accused, of, heresy, in, 1565, he, wrote, his, last, will, signing, over, his, immense, library, to, the, college, bartolom, de, las, casas, died, on, 18, july, 1566, in, madrid, the, text, written, 1516, starts, by, describing, its, purpose, to, present, the, remedies, that, seem, necessary, in, order, that, the, evil, and, harm, that, exists, in, the, indies, cease, and, that, god, and, our, lord, the, prince, may, draw, greater, benefits, than, hitherto, and, that, the, republic, may, be, better, preserved, and, consoled, las, casas, s, first, proposed, remedy, was, a, complete, moratorium, on, the, use, of, indian, labor, in, the, indies, until, such, time, as, better, regulations, of, it, were, set, in, place, this, was, meant, simply, to, halt, the, decimation, of, the, indian, population, and, to, give, the, surviving, indians, time, to, reconstitute, themselves, las, casas, feared, that, at, the, rate, the, exploitation, was, proceeding, it, would, be, too, late, to, hinder, their, annihilation, unless, action, were, taken, rapidly, the, second, was, a, change, in, the, labor, policy, so, that, instead, of, a, colonist, owning, the, labor, of, specific, indians, he, would, have, a, right, to, man, hours, to, be, carried, out, by, no, specific, persons, this, required, the, establishment, of, self, governing, indian, communities, on, the, land, of, colonists, who, would, themselves, organize, to, provide, the, labor, for, their, patron, the, colonist, would, only, have, rights, to, a, certain, portion, of, the, total, labor, so, that, a, part, of, the, indians, were, always, resting, and, taking, care, of, the, sick, he, proposed, 12, other, remedies, all, having, the, specific, aim, of, improving, the, situation, for, the, indians, and, limiting, the, powers, that, colonists, were, able, to, exercise, over, them, the, second, part, of, the, memorial, described, suggestions, for, the, social, and, political, organization, of, indian, communities, relative, to, colonial, ones, las, casas, advocated, the, dismantlement, of, the, city, of, asunci, n, and, the, subsequent, gathering, of, indians, into, communities, of, about, 1, 000, indians, to, be, situated, as, satellites, of, spanish, towns, or, mining, areas, here, las, casas, argued, indians, could, be, better, governed, better, taught, and, indoctrinated, in, the, christian, faith, and, would, be, easier, to, protect, from, abuse, than, if, they, were, in, scattered, settlements, each, town, would, have, a, royal, hospital, built, with, four, wings, in, the, shape, of, a, cross, where, up, to, 200, sick, indians, could, be, cared, for, at, a, time, he, described, in, detail, social, arrangements, distribution, of, work, how, provisions, would, be, divided, and, even, how, table, manners, were, to, be, introduced, regarding, expenses, he, argued, that, this, should, not, seem, expensive, or, difficult, because, after, all, everything, comes, from, them, and, they, work, for, it, and, it, is, theirs, he, even, drew, up, a, budget, of, each, pueblo, s, expenses, to, cover, wages, for, administrators, clerics, bachelors, of, latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig, herders, fishermen, etc, a, short, account, of, the, destruction, of, the, indies, spanish, brev, sima, relaci, n, de, la, destrucci, n, de, las, indias, is, an, account, written, in, 1542, published, in, seville, in, 1552, about, the, mistreatment, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, in, colonial, times, and, sent, to, then, prince, philip, ii, of, spain, one, of, the, stated, purposes, for, writing, the, account, was, las, casas, s, fear, of, spain, coming, under, divine, punishment, and, his, concern, for, the, souls, of, the, native, peoples, the, account, was, one, of, the, first, attempts, by, a, spanish, writer, of, the, colonial, era, to, depict, the, unfair, treatment, that, the, indigenous, people, endured, during, the, early, stages, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, greater, antilles, particularly, the, island, of, hispaniola, las, casas, s, point, of, view, can, be, described, as, being, heavily, against, some, of, the, spanish, methods, of, colonization, which, as, he, described, them, inflicted, great, losses, on, the, indigenous, occupants, of, the, islands, in, addition, his, critique, towards, the, colonizers, served, to, bring, awareness, to, his, audience, on, the, true, meaning, of, christianity, to, dismantle, any, misconceptions, on, evangelization, his, account, was, largely, responsible, for, the, adoption, of, the, new, laws, of, 1542, which, abolished, native, slavery, for, the, first, time, in, european, colonial, history, and, led, to, the, valladolid, debate, the, book, became, an, important, element, in, the, creation, and, propagation, of, the, so, called, black, legend, the, tradition, of, describing, the, spanish, empire, as, exceptionally, morally, corrupt, and, violent, it, was, republished, several, times, by, groups, that, were, critical, of, the, spanish, realm, for, political, or, religious, reasons, the, first, edition, in, translation, was, published, in, dutch, in, 1578, during, the, religious, persecution, of, dutch, protestants, by, the, spanish, crown, followed, by, editions, in, french, 1578, english, 1583, and, german, 1599, all, countries, where, religious, wars, were, raging, the, first, edition, published, in, spain, after, las, casas, s, death, appeared, in, barcelona, during, the, catalan, revolt, of, 1646, the, book, was, banned, by, the, aragonese, inquisition, in, 1659, the, images, described, by, las, casas, were, later, depicted, by, theodore, de, bry, in, copper, plate, engravings, that, served, as, a, medium, of, the, black, legend, against, spain, the, apologetic, summary, history, of, the, people, of, these, indies, spanish, apolog, tica, historia, summaria, de, las, gentes, destas, indias, was, first, written, as, the, 68th, chapter, of, the, general, history, of, the, indies, but, las, casas, changed, it, into, a, volume, of, its, own, recognizing, that, the, material, was, not, historical, the, material, contained, in, the, apologetic, history, is, primarily, ethnographic, accounts, of, the, indigenous, cultures, of, the, indies, the, ta, no, the, ciboney, and, the, guanahatabey, but, it, also, contains, descriptions, of, many, of, the, other, indigenous, cultures, that, las, casas, learned, about, through, his, travels, and, readings, the, history, is, apologetic, because, it, is, written, as, a, defense, of, the, cultural, level, of, the, indians, arguing, throughout, that, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, were, just, as, civilized, as, the, roman, greek, and, egyptian, civilizations, and, more, civilized, than, some, european, civilizations, it, was, in, essence, a, comparative, ethnography, comparing, practices, and, customs, of, european, and, american, cultures, and, evaluating, them, according, to, whether, they, were, good, or, bad, seen, from, a, christian, viewpoint, he, wrote, i, have, declared, and, demonstrated, openly, and, concluded, from, chapter, 22, to, the, end, of, this, whole, book, that, all, people, of, these, our, indies, are, human, so, far, as, is, possible, by, the, natural, and, human, way, and, without, the, light, of, faith, had, their, republics, places, towns, and, cities, most, abundant, and, well, provided, for, and, did, not, lack, anything, to, live, politically, and, socially, and, attain, and, enjoy, civil, happiness, and, they, equaled, many, nations, of, this, world, that, are, renowned, and, considered, civilized, and, they, surpassed, many, others, and, to, none, were, they, inferior, among, those, they, equaled, were, the, greeks, and, the, romans, and, they, surpassed, them, by, many, good, and, better, customs, they, surpassed, also, the, english, and, the, french, and, some, of, the, people, of, our, own, spain, and, they, were, incomparably, superior, to, countless, others, in, having, good, customs, and, lacking, many, evil, ones, this, work, in, which, las, casas, combined, his, own, ethnographic, observations, with, those, of, other, writers, and, compared, customs, and, cultures, between, different, peoples, has, been, characterized, as, an, early, beginning, of, the, discipline, of, anthropology, the, history, of, the, indies, is, a, three, volume, work, begun, in, 1527, while, las, casas, was, in, the, convent, of, puerto, de, plata, it, found, its, final, form, in, 1561, when, he, was, working, in, the, colegio, de, san, gregorio, originally, planned, as, a, six, volume, work, each, volume, describes, a, decade, of, the, history, of, the, indies, from, the, arrival, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, to, 1520, and, most, of, it, is, an, eye, witness, account, it, was, in, the, history, of, the, indies, that, las, casas, finally, regretted, his, advocacy, for, african, slavery, and, included, a, sincere, apology, writing, i, soon, repented, and, judged, myself, guilty, of, ignorance, i, came, to, realize, that, black, slavery, was, as, unjust, as, indian, slavery, and, i, was, not, sure, that, my, ignorance, and, good, faith, would, secure, me, in, the, eyes, of, god, vol, ii, p, 257, history, of, the, indies, has, never, been, fully, translated, into, english, the, only, translations, into, english, are, the, 1971, partial, translation, by, andr, e, m, collard, and, partial, translations, by, cynthia, l, chamberlin, nigel, griffin, michael, hammer, and, blair, sullivan, in, ucla, s, repertorium, columbianum, volumes, vi, vii, and, xi, de, las, casas, copied, columbus, diary, from, his, 1492, voyage, to, modern, day, bahamas, his, copy, is, notable, because, columbus, diary, itself, was, lost, las, casas, s, legacy, has, been, highly, controversial, in, the, years, following, his, death, his, ideas, became, taboo, in, the, spanish, realm, and, he, was, seen, as, a, nearly, heretical, extremist, the, accounts, written, by, his, enemies, lopez, de, g, mara, and, oviedo, were, widely, read, and, published, in, europe, as, the, influence, of, the, spanish, empire, was, displaced, by, that, of, other, european, powers, las, casas, s, accounts, were, utilized, as, political, tools, to, justify, incursions, into, spanish, colonies, this, historiographic, phenomenon, has, been, referred, to, by, some, historians, as, the, black, legend, a, tendency, by, mostly, protestant, authors, to, portray, spanish, catholicism, and, colonialism, in, the, worst, possible, light, opposition, to, las, casas, reached, its, climax, in, historiography, with, spanish, right, wing, nationalist, historians, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, constructing, a, pro, spanish, white, legend, arguing, that, the, spanish, empire, was, benevolent, and, just, and, denying, any, adverse, consequences, of, spanish, colonialism, spanish, pro, imperial, historians, such, as, men, ndez, y, pelayo, men, ndez, pidal, and, j, p, rez, de, barrada, depicted, las, casas, as, a, madman, describing, him, as, a, paranoic, and, a, monomaniac, given, to, exaggeration, and, as, a, traitor, towards, his, own, nation, men, ndez, pelayo, also, accused, las, casas, of, having, been, instrumental, in, suppressing, the, publication, of, juan, gin, s, de, sep, lveda, s, democrates, alter, also, called, democrates, secundus, out, of, spite, but, other, historians, find, that, to, be, unlikely, since, it, was, rejected, by, the, theologians, of, both, alcal, and, salamanca, who, were, unlikely, to, be, influenced, by, las, casas, las, casas, has, also, often, been, accused, of, exaggerating, the, atrocities, he, described, in, the, indies, some, scholars, holding, that, the, initial, population, figures, given, by, him, were, too, high, which, would, make, the, population, decline, look, worse, than, it, actually, was, and, that, epidemics, of, european, disease, were, the, prime, cause, of, the, population, decline, not, violence, and, exploitation, demographic, studies, such, as, those, of, colonial, mexico, by, sherburne, f, cook, in, the, mid, 20th, century, suggested, that, the, decline, in, the, first, years, of, the, conquest, was, indeed, drastic, ranging, between, 80, and, 90, due, to, many, different, causes, but, all, ultimately, traceable, to, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, the, overwhelming, cause, was, disease, introduced, by, the, europeans, historians, have, also, noted, that, exaggeration, and, inflation, of, numbers, was, the, norm, in, writing, in, 16th, century, accounts, and, both, contemporary, detractors, and, supporters, of, las, casas, were, guilty, of, similar, exaggerations, the, dominican, friars, antonio, de, montesinos, and, pedro, de, c, rdoba, had, reported, extensive, violence, already, in, the, first, decade, of, the, colonization, of, the, americas, and, throughout, the, conquest, of, the, americas, there, were, reports, of, abuse, of, the, natives, from, friars, and, priests, and, ordinary, citizens, and, many, massacres, of, indigenous, people, were, reported, in, full, by, those, who, perpetrated, them, even, some, of, las, casas, s, enemies, such, as, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, reported, many, gruesome, atrocities, committed, against, the, indians, by, the, colonizers, all, in, all, modern, historians, tend, to, disregard, the, numerical, figures, given, by, las, casas, but, they, maintain, that, his, general, picture, of, a, violent, and, abusive, conquest, represented, reality, one, persistent, point, of, criticism, has, been, las, casas, s, repeated, suggestions, of, replacing, indian, with, african, slave, labor, even, though, he, regretted, that, position, later, in, his, life, and, included, an, apology, in, his, history, of, the, indies, some, later, criticism, held, him, responsible, for, the, institution, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, one, detractor, the, abolitionist, david, walker, called, las, casas, a, wretch, stimulated, by, sordid, avarice, only, holding, him, responsible, for, the, enslavement, of, thousands, of, africans, other, historians, such, as, john, fiske, writing, in, 1900, denied, that, las, casas, s, suggestions, affected, the, development, of, the, slave, trade, benjamin, keen, likewise, did, not, consider, las, casas, to, have, had, any, substantial, impact, on, the, slave, trade, which, was, well, in, place, before, he, began, writing, that, view, is, contradicted, by, sylvia, wynter, who, argued, that, las, casas, s, 1516, memorial, was, the, direct, cause, of, charles, v, granting, permission, in, 1518, to, transport, the, first, 4, 000, african, slaves, to, jamaica, a, growing, corpus, of, scholarship, has, sought, to, deconstruct, and, reassess, the, role, of, las, casas, in, spanish, colonialism, daniel, castro, in, his, another, face, of, empire, 2007, takes, on, such, a, task, he, argues, that, he, was, more, of, a, politician, than, a, humanitarian, and, that, his, liberation, policies, were, always, combined, with, schemes, to, make, colonial, extraction, of, resources, from, the, natives, more, efficient, he, also, argues, that, las, casas, failed, to, realize, that, by, seeking, to, replace, indigenous, spirituality, with, christianity, he, was, undertaking, a, religious, colonialism, that, was, more, intrusive, than, the, physical, one, the, responses, to, his, work, are, varied, some, claim, that, castro, s, portrayal, of, las, casas, had, an, air, of, anachronism, others, have, agreed, with, castro, s, deconstruction, of, las, casas, as, a, nuanced, and, contradictory, historical, figure, in, 1848, ciudad, de, san, crist, bal, then, the, capital, of, the, mexican, state, of, chiapas, was, renamed, san, crist, bal, de, las, casas, in, honor, of, its, first, bishop, his, work, is, a, particular, inspiration, behind, the, work, of, the, las, casas, institute, at, blackfriars, hall, oxford, he, is, also, often, cited, as, a, predecessor, of, the, liberation, theology, movement, bartolom, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, commemoration, on, 20, july, on, 18, july, and, at, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, on, 17, july, in, the, catholic, church, the, dominicans, introduced, his, cause, for, canonization, in, 1976, in, 2002, the, church, began, the, process, for, his, beatification, he, was, among, the, first, to, develop, a, view, of, unity, among, humankind, in, the, new, world, stating, that, all, people, of, the, world, are, humans, and, that, they, had, a, natural, right, to, liberty, a, combination, of, thomist, rights, philosophy, with, augustinian, political, theology, in, this, capacity, an, ecumenical, human, rights, institute, located, in, san, crist, bal, de, las, casas, the, centro, fray, bartolom, de, las, casas, de, derechos, humanos, was, established, by, bishop, samuel, ruiz, in, 1989, residencial, las, casas, in, santurce, san, juan,
