is, often, referred, to, as, one, of, the, founding, figures, of, personality, psychology, he, contributed, to, the, formation, of, values, scales, and, rejected, both, a, psychoanalytic, approach, to, personality, which, he, thought, often, was, too, deeply, interpretive, and, a, behavioral, approach, which, he, thought, did, not, provide, deep, enough, interpretations, from, their, data, instead, of, these, popular, approaches, he, developed, an, eclectic, theory, based, on, traits, he, emphasized, the, uniqueness, of, each, individual, and, the, importance, of, the, present, context, as, opposed, to, history, for, understanding, the, personality, allport, had, a, profound, and, lasting, influence, on, the, field, of, psychology, even, though, his, work, is, cited, much, less, often, than, that, of, other, well, known, figures, part, of, his, influence, stemmed, from, his, knack, for, exploring, and, broadly, conceptualizing, important, topics, e, g, rumor, prejudice, religion, traits, another, part, of, his, influence, resulted, from, the, deep, and, lasting, impression, he, made, on, his, students, during, his, long, teaching, career, many, of, whom, went, on, to, have, important, careers, in, psychology, among, his, many, students, were, jerome, s, bruner, anthony, greenwald, stanley, milgram, leo, postman, thomas, pettigrew, and, m, brewster, smith, his,

morphine, addicts, analysis, of, the, medicine, revealed, its, active, ingredient, to, be, nothing, more, than, additional, morphine, packed, with, a, bottle, of, pink, whiskey, to, mix, with, the, morphin, when, it, gets, low, adams, referred, to, allport, as, a, who, pretend, to, be, a, physician, is, no, less, scoundrelly, and, is, even, more, dangerous, than, other, fraudulent, addiction,

contributed, to, the, trait, theory, of, personality, and, is, known, as, a, trait, psychologist, he, opposed, the, idea, that, people, can, be, classified, according, to, a, small, number, of, trait, dimensions, arguing, that, each, person, is, unique, and, distinguished, by, particular, traits, in, his, work, concepts, of, trait, and, personality, 1927, allport, states, that, traits, are, habits, possessed, of, social, significance, and, become, very, predictable, traits, are, a, unit, of, personality, allport, emphasized, that, an, individual, s, personality, is, the, single, most, unique, thing, about, a, person, one, of, his, early, projects, was, to, go, through, the, dictionary, and, locate, every, term, that, he, thought, could, describe, a, person, from, this, he, developed, a, list, of, 4500, trait, like, words, he, organized, these, words, into, three, levels, of, traits, this, is, similar, to, goldberg, s, fundamental, lexical, hypothesis, or, the, hypothesis, that, humans, develop, widely, used, generic, terms, for, individual, differences, in, their, daily, interactions, over, time, allport, s, three, level, hierarchy, of, traits, are, 1, cardinal, trait, these, traits, are, rare, but, is, the, trait, that, dominates, and, shape, a, person, s, behavior, they, exert, a, powerful, influence, on, behavior, which, becomes, aspects, of, a, person, s, identity, these, are, the, ruling, passions, obsessions, such, as, a, need, for, money, fame, etc, 2, central, trait, these, traits, are, general, characteristics, found, in, some, degree, in, every, person, these, are, the, basic, building, blocks, that, shape, most, of, our, behavior, although, they, are, not, as, overwhelming, as, cardinal, traits, they, influence, but, do, not, determine, behavior, an, example, of, a, central, trait, would, be, honesty, 3, secondary, trait, these, traits, are, the, bottom, tier, of, the, hierarchy, and, are, not, as, apparent, as, central, traits, less, influential, secondary, traits, are, characteristics, seen, only, in, certain, circumstances, such, as, particular, likes, or, dislikes, that, a, very, close, friend, may, know, they, must, be, included, to, provide, a, complete, picture, of, human, complexity, overall, allport, s, three, level, hierarchy, of, traits, provides, framework, for, understanding, the, different, levels, of, traits, that, collectively, shape, an, individual, s, personality, it, is, perceived, when, infants, can, understand, themselves, through, sensations, and, figure, out, what, makes, them, and, what, does, not, though, understanding, whom, they, are, by, having, a, significance, in, their, name, has, this, can, then, give, them, a, sense, of, how, they, are, and, what, that, can, mean, socially, with, having, a, sense, of, who, they, are, in, this, stage, they, want, to, have, a, form, of, independence, that, can, be, stepped, away, from, adult, supervision, in, this, stage, the, child, can, see, their, bodies, and, extend, to, toys, the, words, that, seem, to, be, stated, in, their, mind, is, mine, there, seems, to, be, an, awareness, of, the, good, me, and, the, bad, me, for, the, children, that, can, bring, up, what, they, expect, others, to, expect, from, them, in, this, stage, certain, goals, they, see, for, themselves, are, brought, up, at, this, stage, it, is, brought, to, the, awareness, that, thoughts, can, help, solve, problems, in, which, they, tend, to, think, a, lot, about, their, thinking, in, this, stage, it, is, believed, that, future, goals, are, built, to, give, a, sense, of, meaning, to, one, s, life, allport, viewed, a, healthy, person, to, create, problems, by, making, future, goals, that, can, be, seen, as, unattainable, in, many, cases, this, sense, of, creating, these, long, term, goals, is, set, to, differentiate, from, other, stages, and, even, from, having, a, healthy, or, sick, personality, in, this, final, stage, the, self, is, seen, as, a, knower, who, can, be, aware, of, and, surpass, the, seven, other, propriate, functions, when, gone, through, all, stages, you, appear, to, use, several, or, even, all, in, daily, tasks, and, experiences, allport, hypothesized, the, idea, of, internal, and, external, forces, that, influence, an, individual, s, behavior, he, called, these, forces, genotypes, and, phenotypes, genotypes, are, internal, forces, that, relate, to, how, a, person, retains, information, and, uses, it, to, interact, with, the, external, world, phenotypes, are, external, forces, these, relate, to, the, way, an, individual, accepts, his, surroundings, and, how, others, influence, their, behavior, these, forces, generate, the, ways, in, which, we, behave, and, are, the, groundwork, for, the, creation, of, individual, traits, the, problem, with, this, hypothesis, is, that, it, cannot, be, proven, as, they, are, internal, theories, influenced, presumably, by, the, outer, environment, allport, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, draw, a, distinction, between, motive, and, drive, he, suggested, that, a, drive, forms, as, a, reaction, to, a, motive, which, may, outgrow, the, motive, as, the, reason, for, a, behavior, the, drive, then, becomes, autonomous, and, distinct, from, the, motive, whether, the, motive, was, instinct, or, something, else, the, idea, that, drives, can, become, independent, of, the, original, motives, for, a, given, behavior, is, known, as, functional, autonomy, allport, gives, the, example, of, a, man, who, seeks, to, perfect, his, task, or, craft, his, original, motive, may, be, a, sense, of, inferiority, engrained, in, his, childhood, but, his, diligence, in, his, work, and, the, motive, it, acquires, later, on, is, a, need, to, excel, in, his, chosen, profession, which, becomes, the, man, s, drive, allport, says, that, the, theory, avoids, the, absurdity, of, regarding, the, energy, of, life, now, in, the, present, as, somehow, consisting, of, early, archaic, forms, instincts, prepotent, reflexes, or, the, never, changing, id, learning, brings, new, systems, of, interests, into, existence, just, as, it, does, new, abilities, and, skills, at, each, stage, of, development, these, interests, are, always, contemporary, whatever, drives, drives, now
