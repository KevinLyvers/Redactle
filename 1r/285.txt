mass, culture, and, with, the, playwrights, pedro, calder, n, de, la, barca, and, tirso, de, molina, defined, the, characteristics, of, spanish, baroque, theatre, with, great, insight, into, the, human, condition, the, literary, production, of, lope, de, vega, includes, 3, 000, sonnets, three, novels, four, novellas, nine, epic, poems, and, approximately, 500, stageplays, personally, and, professionally, lope, de, vega, was, friend, to, the, writer, francisco, de, quevedo, and, arch, enemy, of, the, dramatist, juan, ruiz, de, alarc, n, the, volume, of, literary, works, produced, by, lope, de, vega, earned, him, the, envy, of, his, contemporaries, such, as, cervantes, and, luis, de, g, ngora, and, the, admiration, of, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, for, such, a, vast, and, colourful, oeuvre, lope, de, vega, was, also, a, close, friend, of, sebastian, francisco, de, medrano, founder, and, president, of, the, poetic, academy, of, madrid, he, would, attend, medrano, s, academy, from, 1616, to, 1626, and, his, relationship, with, medrano, is, evident, in, his, el, laurel, de, apolo, 1630, in, silva, vii, lope, de, vega, carpio, was, born, november, 1562, in, madrid, in, the, puerta, de, guadalajara, to, a, family, of, natives, of, the, valley, of, carriedo, his, father, f, lix, de, vega, was, an, embroiderer, little, is, known, of, his, mother, francisca, fern, ndez, flores, he, later, took, the, distinguished, surname, of, carpio, from, his, paternal, grandmother, catalina, del, carpio, after, a, brief, stay, in, valladolid, his, father, moved, to, madrid, in, 1561, perhaps, drawn, by, the, possibilities, of, the, new, capital, city, however, lope, de, vega, would, later, affirm, that, his, father, arrived, in, madrid, through, a, love, affair, from, which, his, future, mother, was, to, rescue, him, thus, the, writer, became, the, fruit, of, this, reconciliation, and, owed, his, existence, to, the, same, jealousies, he, would, later, analyze, so, much, in, his, dramatic, works, the, first, indications, of, young, lope, s, genius, became, apparent, in, his, earliest, years, his, friend, and, biographer, p, rez, de, montalb, n, stated, that, at, the, age, of, five, he, was, already, reading, spanish, and, latin, while, he, was, still, unable, to, write, he, would, share, his, breakfast, with, the, older, boys, in, exchange, for, their, help, scribing, his, verses, by, his, tenth, birthday, he, was, translating, latin, verse, he, wrote, his, first, play, when, he, was, 12, allegedly, el, verdadero, amante, as, he, would, later, affirm, in, his, dedication, of, the, work, to, his, son, lope, although, these, statements, are, most, probably, exaggerations, his, great, talent, bore, him, to, the, school, of, poet, and, musician, vicente, espinel, in, madrid, to, whom, he, later, always, referred, with, veneration, in, his, fourteenth, year, he, continued, his, studies, in, the, colegio, imperial, a, jesuit, school, in, madrid, from, which, he, absconded, to, take, part, in, a, military, expedition, in, portugal, following, that, escapade, he, had, the, good, fortune, of, being, taken, into, the, protection, of, the, bishop, of, vila, who, recognized, the, lad, s, talent, and, saw, him, enrolled, in, the, university, of, alcal, following, graduation, lope, had, planned, to, follow, in, his, patron, s, footsteps, and, join, the, priesthood, but, those, plans, were, dashed, by, falling, in, love, and, realizing, that, celibacy, was, not, for, him, thus, he, failed, to, attain, a, bachelor, s, degree, and, made, what, living, he, could, as, a, secretary, to, aristocrats, or, by, writing, plays, in, 1583, lope, enlisted, in, the, spanish, navy, and, saw, action, at, the, battle, of, ponta, delgada, in, the, azores, under, the, command, of, his, future, friend, lvaro, de, baz, n, 1st, marquis, of, santa, cruz, to, whose, son, he, would, later, dedicate, a, play, following, this, he, returned, to, madrid, and, began, his, career, as, a, playwright, in, earnest, he, also, began, a, love, affair, with, elena, osorio, the, filis, of, his, poems, who, was, separated, from, her, husband, actor, crist, bal, calder, n, and, was, the, daughter, of, a, leading, theater, director, when, after, some, five, years, of, this, torrid, affair, elena, spurned, lope, in, favor, of, another, suitor, his, vitriolic, attacks, on, her, and, her, family, landed, him, in, jail, for, libel, and, ultimately, earned, him, the, punishment, of, eight, years, banishment, from, the, court, and, two, years, exile, from, castile, after, libelling, members, of, his, family, in, his, writing, lope, de, vega, undauntedly, went, into, exile, he, took, with, him, 16, year, old, isabel, de, alderete, y, urbina, known, in, his, poems, by, the, anagram, belisa, the, daughter, of, philip, ii, s, court, painter, diego, de, urbina, the, two, married, under, pressure, from, her, family, on, 10, may, 1588, just, a, few, weeks, later, on, 29, may, lope, signed, up, for, another, tour, of, duty, with, the, spanish, navy, this, was, the, summer, of, 1588, and, the, armada, was, about, to, sail, against, england, it, is, likely, that, his, military, enlistment, was, the, condition, required, by, isabel, s, family, eager, to, be, rid, of, such, an, ill, presentable, son, in, law, to, forgive, him, for, carrying, her, away, lope, s, luck, again, served, him, well, however, and, his, ship, the, san, juan, was, one, of, the, vessels, to, make, it, home, to, spanish, harbors, in, the, aftermath, of, that, failed, expedition, back, in, spain, by, december, 1588, he, settled, in, the, city, of, valencia, there, he, lived, with, isabel, de, urbina, and, continued, perfecting, his, dramatic, formula, participating, regularly, in, the, tertulia, known, as, the, academia, de, los, nocturnos, in, the, company, of, such, accomplished, dramatists, as, the, canon, francisco, agust, n, t, rrega, the, secretary, to, the, duke, of, gand, a, gaspar, de, aguilar, guill, n, de, castro, carlos, boyl, and, ricardo, de, turia, with, them, he, refined, his, approach, to, theatrical, writing, by, violating, the, unity, of, action, and, weaving, two, plots, together, in, a, single, play, a, technique, known, as, imbroglio, in, 1590, at, the, end, of, his, two, years, exile, from, the, realm, he, moved, to, toledo, to, serve, francisco, de, ribera, barroso, who, later, became, the, 2nd, marquis, of, malpica, and, some, time, later, antonio, lvarez, de, toledo, 5th, duke, of, alba, in, this, later, appointment, he, became, gentleman, of, the, bedchamber, to, the, ducal, court, of, the, house, of, alba, where, he, lived, from, 1592, to, 1595, here, he, read, the, work, of, juan, del, encina, from, whom, he, improved, the, character, of, the, donaire, perfecting, still, further, his, dramatic, formula, in, the, fall, of, 1594, isabel, de, urbina, died, of, postpartum, complications, it, was, around, this, time, that, lope, wrote, his, pastoral, novel, la, arcadia, which, included, many, poems, and, was, based, on, the, duke, s, household, in, alba, de, tormes, in, 1595, following, isabel, s, death, in, childbirth, he, left, the, duke, s, service, and, eight, years, having, passed, returned, to, madrid, there, were, other, love, affairs, and, other, scandals, antonia, trillo, de, armenta, who, earned, him, another, lawsuit, and, micaela, de, luj, n, an, illiterate, but, beautiful, actress, who, inspired, a, rich, series, of, sonnets, rewarded, him, with, four, children, and, was, his, lover, until, around, 1608, in, 1598, he, married, juana, de, guardo, the, daughter, of, a, wealthy, butcher, nevertheless, his, trysts, with, others, including, micaela, continued, in, the, 17th, century, lope, s, literary, output, reached, its, peak, from, 1607, he, was, also, employed, as, a, secretary, but, not, without, various, additional, duties, by, the, duke, of, sessa, once, that, decade, was, over, however, his, personal, situation, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, his, favorite, son, carlos, f, lix, by, juana, died, and, in, 1612, juana, herself, died, in, childbirth, after, the, heartbreaking, loss, of, his, son, and, wife, lope, summoned, his, remaining, children, still, alive, under, the, same, roof, to, devote, himself, to, christianity, his, writing, in, the, early, 1610s, also, assumed, heavier, religious, influences, and, in, 1614, he, joined, the, priesthood, the, taking, of, holy, orders, did, not, however, impede, his, romantic, dalliances, what, is, more, he, supplied, his, employer, the, duke, with, various, female, companions, the, most, notable, and, lasting, of, lope, s, relationships, was, with, marta, de, nevares, who, met, him, in, 1616, and, would, remain, with, him, until, her, death, in, 1632, further, tragedies, followed, in, 1635, with, the, loss, of, lope, his, son, by, micaela, and, a, worthy, poet, in, his, own, right, in, a, shipwreck, off, the, coast, of, venezuela, and, the, abduction, and, subsequent, abandonment, of, his, beloved, youngest, daughter, antonia, lope, de, vega, took, to, his, bed, and, died, of, scarlet, fever, in, madrid, on, 27, august, of, that, year, he, was, buried, in, st, sebastian, s, church, madrid, the, period, of, life, that, characterizes, priestly, ordination, of, lope, de, vega, was, one, of, profound, existential, crisis, perhaps, impelled, by, the, death, of, close, relatives, to, this, inspiration, respond, his, sacred, rhymes, and, the, numerous, devout, works, he, began, to, compose, as, well, as, the, meditative, and, philosophical, tone, that, appears, in, his, last, verses, on, the, night, of, 19, december, 1611, the, writer, was, the, victim, of, an, assassination, attempt, from, which, he, could, barely, escape, juana, de, guardo, suffered, frequent, illnesses, and, in, 1612, carlos, f, lix, died, of, fevers, on, 13, august, the, following, year, juana, de, guardo, died, while, giving, birth, to, feliciana, so, many, misfortunes, affected, lope, emotionally, and, on, 24, may, 1614, he, finally, decided, to, be, ordained, a, priest, the, literary, expression, of, this, crisis, and, its, repentances, are, the, sacred, rhymes, published, in, 1614, there, it, says, if, the, body, wants, to, be, earth, on, earth, the, soul, wants, to, be, heaven, in, heaven, unredeemed, dualism, that, constitutes, all, its, essence, the, sacred, rhymes, constitute, a, book, at, the, same, time, introspective, in, the, sonnets, he, uses, the, technique, of, the, spiritual, exercises, that, he, learned, in, his, studies, with, the, jesuits, as, devotee, for, the, poems, dedicated, to, diverse, saints, or, inspired, in, the, sacred, iconography, then, in, full, deployment, thanks, to, the, recommendations, emanated, from, the, council, of, trent, in, 1627, he, was, admitted, as, a, knight, of, the, order, of, malta, this, was, an, enormous, honour, for, him, since, he, had, always, taken, an, interest, in, orders, of, chivalry, in, 1603, he, had, published, the, play, el, valor, de, malta, the, valour, of, malta, about, the, maritime, battles, of, the, order, in, his, portrait, by, eugenio, cax, s, he, wears, the, habit, of, the, order, of, malta, lope, s, non, dramatic, works, were, collected, and, published, in, spain, in, the, eighteenth, century, under, the, title, obras, sueltas, madrid, 21, vols, 1776, 79, the, more, important, elements, of, this, collection, include, the, following, lope, de, vega, was, one, of, the, greatest, spanish, poets, of, his, time, along, with, luis, de, g, ngora, and, francisco, de, quevedo, his, poems, of, moorish, and, pastoral, themes, were, extremely, popular, in, the, 1580s, and, 1590s, and, in, these, he, portrayed, elements, of, his, own, love, affairs, appearing, as, a, moor, called, zaide, or, a, shepherd, called, belardo, in, 1602, he, published, two, hundred, sonnets, in, the, collection, la, hermosura, de, ang, lica, and, in, 1604, he, republished, them, with, new, material, in, rimas, in, 1614, his, religious, sonnets, appeared, in, a, book, entitled, rimas, sacras, which, was, another, bestseller, in, 1634, in, a, third, book, with, similar, title, rimas, humanas, y, divinas, del, licenciado, tom, de, burguillos, which, has, been, considered, his, poetic, masterpiece, and, the, most, modern, book, of, 17th, century, poetry, lope, created, a, heteronym, he, concludes, the, identity, of, tome, de, burguillos, who, has, a, deep, and, intimate, romantic, connection, with, a, maid, named, juana, this, is, a, direct, comparison, and, clash, with, lope, s, skeptical, outlook, on, society, lope, was, the, playwright, who, established, in, spanish, drama, the, three, act, comedia, as, the, definitive, form, ignoring, the, precepts, of, the, prevailing, school, of, his, contemporaries, in, arte, nuevo, de, hacer, comedias, en, este, tiempo, 1609, which, was, his, artistic, manifesto, and, the, justification, of, his, style, which, broke, the, neoclassical, three, unities, of, place, time, and, action, he, showed, that, he, knew, the, established, rules, of, poetry, but, refused, to, follow, them, on, the, grounds, that, the, vulgar, spaniard, cared, nothing, about, them, let, us, then, speak, to, him, in, the, language, of, fools, since, it, is, he, who, pays, us, are, famous, lines, from, his, manifesto, lope, boasted, that, he, was, a, spaniard, pur, sang, pure, blooded, maintaining, that, a, writer, s, business, is, to, write, so, as, to, make, himself, understood, and, took, the, position, of, a, defender, of, the, language, of, ordinary, life, lope, s, literary, influence, was, chiefly, latin, italian, and, while, he, defended, the, tradition, of, the, nation, and, the, simplicity, of, the, old, castilian, he, emphasized, his, university, education, and, the, difference, between, those, educated, in, the, classics, and, the, layman, the, majority, of, his, works, were, written, in, haste, and, to, order, lope, confessed, that, more, than, a, hundred, of, my, comedies, have, taken, only, twenty, four, hours, to, pass, from, the, muses, to, the, boards, of, the, theatre, his, biographer, p, rez, de, montalb, n, tells, how, in, toledo, lope, composed, fifteen, acts, in, as, many, days, five, comedies, in, two, weeks, in, spite, of, some, discrepancies, in, the, figures, lope, s, own, records, indicate, that, by, 1604, he, had, composed, 230, three, act, plays, comedias, the, figure, had, risen, to, 483, by, 1609, to, 800, by, 1618, to, 1000, by, 1620, and, to, 1500, by, 1632, montalb, n, in, his, fama, p, stuma, 1636, set, down, the, total, of, lope, s, dramatic, productions, at, 1800, comedias, and, more, than, 400, shorter, sacramental, plays, of, these, 637, plays, are, known, by, their, titles, but, only, about, 450, are, extant, many, of, these, pieces, were, printed, during, lope, s, lifetime, mostly, by, the, playwright, himself, in, the, shape, of, twelve, play, volumes, but, also, by, booksellers, who, surreptitiously, bought, manuscripts, from, the, actors, who, performed, them, the, classification, of, this, large, mass, of, dramatic, literature, is, a, task, of, great, difficulty, the, terms, traditionally, employed, comedy, tragedy, and, the, like, are, difficult, to, apply, to, lope, s, oeuvre, and, another, approach, to, categorization, has, been, suggested, lope, s, work, essentially, belongs, to, the, drama, of, intrigue, the, plot, determining, everything, else, lope, used, history, especially, spanish, history, as, his, main, source, of, subject, matter, there, were, few, national, and, patriotic, subjects, from, the, reign, of, king, pelayo, to, the, history, of, his, own, age, he, did, not, put, upon, the, stage, nevertheless, lope, s, most, celebrated, plays, belong, to, the, class, called, capa, y, espada, cloak, and, dagger, where, the, plots, are, chiefly, love, intrigues, along, with, affairs, of, honor, most, commonly, involving, the, petty, nobility, of, medieval, spain, among, the, best, known, works, of, this, class, are, el, perro, del, hortelano, the, dog, in, the, manger, el, castigo, sin, venganza, punishment, without, revenge, and, el, maestro, de, danzar, the, dance, teacher, in, some, of, these, lope, strives, to, set, forth, some, moral, maxim, and, to, illustrate, its, abuse, with, a, living, example, on, the, theme, that, poverty, is, no, crime, in, the, play, las, flores, de, don, juan, he, uses, the, history, of, two, brothers, to, illustrate, the, triumph, of, virtuous, poverty, over, opulent, vice, while, indirectly, attacking, the, institution, of, primogeniture, which, often, places, in, the, hands, of, an, unworthy, person, the, honor, and, substance, of, a, family, when, younger, members, would, be, better, qualified, for, the, trust, however, such, morality, pieces, are, rare, in, lope, s, repertory, generally, his, aim, is, to, amuse, and, stir, with, his, focus, being, on, the, plot, not, concerning, himself, with, instruction, in, el, villano, en, su, rinc, n, described, as, a, romantic, comedy, francis, i, of, france, ends, up, spending, the, night, in, a, woodcutter, s, hut, after, becoming, lost, during, a, hunt, resulting, in, a, confrontation, between, peasant, philosopher, and, king, the, peasant, s, refusal, to, even, look, upon, the, king, s, magnificence, grand, and, dramatic, compared, with, the, humble, rinc, n, is, rebuked, by, a, gentleman, of, the, king, s, court, a, king, of, such, might, that, the, scythian, and, fierce, turk, tremble, before, his, golden, fleurs, de, lis, lope, encountered, a, poorly, organized, dramatic, tradition, plays, were, sometimes, composed, in, four, acts, sometimes, in, three, and, though, they, were, written, in, verse, the, structure, of, the, versification, was, left, to, the, individual, writer, because, the, spanish, public, liked, it, he, adopted, the, style, of, drama, which, was, then, in, vogue, he, enlarged, its, narrow, framework, to, a, great, degree, introducing, a, wide, range, of, material, for, dramatic, situations, the, bible, ancient, mythology, the, lives, of, the, saints, ancient, history, spanish, history, the, legends, of, the, middle, ages, the, writings, of, the, italian, novelists, current, events, and, everyday, spanish, life, in, the, 17th, century, prior, to, lope, playwrights, sketched, the, conditions, of, persons, and, their, characters, superficially, with, fuller, observation, and, more, careful, description, lope, de, vega, depicted, real, character, types, with, language, and, accouterments, appropriate, to, their, position, in, society, the, old, comedy, was, awkward, and, poor, in, its, versification, lope, introduced, order, into, all, the, forms, of, national, poetry, from, the, old, romance, couplets, to, the, lyrical, combinations, borrowed, from, italy, he, wrote, that, those, who, should, come, after, him, had, only, to, go, on, along, the, path, which, he, had, opened, lope, de, vega, encountered, other, poets, who, were, unimpressed, with, his, discoveries, and, attempted, to, defame, his, writing, the, spanish, poet, pedro, de, torres, r, mila, wrote, his, thoughts, on, lope, in, his, latin, satire, spongia, paris, 1617, torres, wrote, personal, attacks, on, lope, s, sacramental, plays, and, sought, to, scandalize, his, name, and, reputation, this, attempt, backfired, on, torres, due, to, the, overwhelmingly, negative, responses, his, spongia, received, from, the, public, after, its, release, scholars, and, poets, alike, came, to, the, defense, of, lope, de, vega, and, wrote, many, counterclaims, against, the, spongia, directed, at, torres, himself, like, juan, rodr, guez, de, fonseca, s, exposulatio, spongiae, listed, here, are, some, of, the, better, known, of, de, vega, s, plays, in, january, 2023, an, anonymous, work, in, the, collection, of, the, national, library, of, spain, la, francesa, laura, the, frenchwoman, laura, was, identified, with, the, help, of, artificial, intelligence, as, another, comedy, by, lope, de, vega, the, comedy, was, classified, as, a, late, work, of, lope, de, vega, and, dated, from, 1628, to, 1630, as, its, flattering, treatment, of, france, could, be, attributed, to, the, momentary, good, relationship, between, spain, and, france, during, the, thirty, years, war, having, england, as, a, common, enemy, later, investigations, by, literary, historians, confirmed, the, findings, of, artificial, intelligence, in, harry, turtledove, s, alternate, history, novel, ruled, britannia, in, which, the, spanish,
