buxtehude, and, reincken, involved, a, 450, kilometre, 280, mi, journey, each, way, reportedly, on, foot, buxtehude, probably, introduced, bach, to, his, friend, reincken, so, that, he, could, learn, from, his, compositional, technique, especially, his, mastery, of, the, fugue, his, organ, playing, and, his, skills, with, improvisation, bach, knew, reincken, s, music, very, well, he, copied,

and, employ, the, dynamic, rhythms, and, harmonic, schemes, found, in, the, music, of, italians, such, as, vivaldi, corelli, and, torelli, bach, absorbed, these, stylistic, aspects, to, a, certain, extent, by, transcribing, vivaldi, s, string, and, wind, concertos, for, harpsichord, and, organ, many, of, these, transcribed, works, are, still, regularly, performed, bach, was, particularly,

city, in, the, words, of, christoph, wolff, assuming, the, directorship, was, a, shrewd, move, that, consolidated, bach, s, firm, grip, on, leipzig, s, principal, musical, institutions, every, week, the, collegium, musicum, would, give, two, hour, performances, in, winter, at, the, caf, zimmermann, a, coffeehouse, on, catherine, street, off, the, main, market, square, and, during, the, summer,

prince, to, give, him, the, title, of, court, composer, he, later, extended, this, work, into, a, full, mass, by, adding, a, credo, sanctus, and, agnus, dei, the, music, for, which, was, partly, based, on, his, own, cantatas, and, partly, original, bach, s, appointment, as, court, composer, was, an, element, of, his, long, term, struggle, to, achieve, greater, bargaining, power, with, the, leipzig, council, between, 1737, and, 1739, bach, s, former, pupil, carl, gotthelf, gerlach, held, the, directorship, of, the, collegium, musicum, in, 1735, bach, started, preparing, his, first,

1081, gasparini, missa, canonica, and, caldara, bwv, 1082, bach, s, own, style, shifted, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, showing, an, increased, integration, of, polyphonic, structures, and, canons, and, other, elements, of, the, stile, antico, his, fourth, and, last, clavier, bung, volume, the, goldberg, variations, for, two, manual, harpsichord, contained, nine, canons, and, was, published, in, 1741, throughout, this, period, bach, also, continued, to, adopt, music, of, contemporaries, such, as, handel, bnb, i, k, 2, and, st, lzel, bwv, 200, and, gave, many, of, his, own, earlier, compositions, such, as, the, st, matthew, and, st, john, passions, and, the, great, eighteen, chorale, preludes, their, final, revisions, he, also, programmed, and, adapted, music, by, composers, of, a, younger, generation, including, pergolesi, bwv, 1083, and, his, own, students, such, as, goldberg, bnb, i, g, 2, in, 1746, bach, was, preparing, to, enter, lorenz, christoph, mizler, s, society, of, musical, sciences, in, order, to, be, admitted, bach, had, to, submit, a, composition, for, which, he, chose, his, canonic, variations, on, vom, himmel, hoch, da, komm, ich, her, and, a, portrait, which, was, painted, by, elias, gottlob, haussmann, and, featured, bach, s, canon, triplex, 6, voc, in, may, 1747, bach, visited, the, court, of, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, in, potsdam, the, king, played, a, theme, for, bach, and, challenged, him, to, improvise, a, fugue, based, on, his, theme, bach, obliged, playing, a, three, part, fugue, on, one, of, frederick, s, fortepianos, by, gottfried, silbermann, which, was, a, new, type, of, instrument, at, the, time, upon, his, return, to, leipzig, he, composed, a, set, of, fugues, and, canons, and, a, trio, sonata, based, on, the, thema, regium, theme, of, the, king, within, a, few, weeks, this, music, was, published, as, the, musical, offering, and, dedicated, to, frederick, the, sch, bler, chorales, a, set, of, six, chorale, preludes, transcribed, from, cantata, movements, bach, had, composed, some, two, decades, earlier, were, published, within, a, year, around, the, same, time, the, set, of, five, canonic, variations, which, bach, had, submitted, when, entering, mizler, s, society, in, 1747, were, also, printed, two, large, scale, compositions, occupied, a, central, place, in, bach, s, last, years, from, around, 1742, he, wrote, and, revised, the, various, canons, and, fugues, of, the, art, of, fugue, which, he, continued, to, prepare, for, publication, until, shortly, before, his, death, after, extracting, a, cantata, bwv, 191, from, his, 1733, kyrie, gloria, mass, for, the, dresden, court, in, the, mid, 1740s, bach, expanded, that, setting, into, his, mass, in, b, minor, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, although, the, complete, mass, was, never, performed, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, it, is, considered, among, the, greatest, choral, works, in, history, in, january, 1749, bach, s, daughter, elisabeth, juliane, friederica, married, his, pupil, johann, christoph, altnickol, bach, s, health, was, declining, on, 2, june, heinrich, von, br, hl, wrote, to, one, of, the, leipzig, burgomasters, to, request, that, his, music, director, gottlob, harrer, fill, the, thomaskantor, and, director, musices, posts, upon, the, eventual, decease, of, mr, bach, becoming, blind, bach, underwent, eye, surgery, in, march, 1750, and, again, in, april, by, the, british, eye, surgeon, john, taylor, a, man, widely, understood, today, as, a, charlatan, and, believed, to, have, blinded, hundreds, of, people, bach, died, on, 28, july, 1750, from, complications, due, to, the, unsuccessful, treatment, an, inventory, drawn, up, a, few, months, after, bach, s, death, shows, that, his, estate, included, five, harpsichords, two, lute, harpsichords, three, violins, three, violas, two, cellos, a, viola, da, gamba, a, lute, and, a, spinet, along, with, 52, sacred, books, including, works, by, martin, luther, and, josephus, the, composer, s, son, carl, philipp, emanuel, saw, to, it, that, the, art, of, fugue, although, still, unfinished, was, published, in, 1751, together, with, one, of, the, composer, s, former, students, johann, friedrich, agricola, the, son, also, wrote, the, obituary, nekrolog, which, was, published, in, mizler, s, musikalische, bibliothek, a, periodical, journal, produced, by, the, society, of, musical, sciences, in, 1754, from, an, early, age, bach, studied, the, works, of, his, musical, contemporaries, of, the, baroque, period, and, those, of, prior, generations, and, those, influences, were, reflected, in, his, music, like, his, contemporaries, handel, telemann, and, vivaldi, bach, composed, concertos, suites, recitatives, da, capo, arias, and, four, part, choral, music, and, employed, basso, continuo, bach, s, music, was, harmonically, more, innovative, than, his, peer, composers, employing, surprisingly, dissonant, chords, and, progressions, often, with, extensive, exploration, of, harmonic, possibilities, within, one, piece, the, hundreds, of, sacred, works, bach, created, are, usually, seen, as, manifesting, not, just, his, craft, but, also, a, truly, devout, relationship, with, god, he, had, taught, luther, s, small, catechism, as, the, thomaskantor, in, leipzig, and, some, of, his, pieces, represent, it, the, lutheran, chorale, was, the, basis, of, much, of, his, work, in, elaborating, these, hymns, into, his, chorale, preludes, he, wrote, more, cogent, and, tightly, integrated, works, than, most, even, when, they, were, massive, and, lengthy, the, large, scale, structure, of, every, major, bach, sacred, vocal, work, is, evidence, of, subtle, elaborate, planning, to, create, a, religiously, and, musically, powerful, expression, for, example, the, st, matthew, passion, like, other, works, of, its, kind, illustrated, the, passion, with, bible, text, reflected, in, recitatives, arias, choruses, and, chorales, but, in, crafting, this, work, bach, created, an, overall, experience, that, has, been, found, over, the, intervening, centuries, to, be, both, musically, thrilling, and, spiritually, profound, bach, published, or, carefully, compiled, in, manuscript, many, collections, of, pieces, that, explored, the, range, of, artistic, and, technical, possibilities, inherent, in, almost, every, genre, of, his, time, except, opera, for, example, the, well, tempered, clavier, comprises, two, books, each, of, which, presents, a, prelude, and, fugue, in, every, major, and, minor, key, displaying, a, dizzying, variety, of, structural, contrapuntal, and, fugal, techniques, four, part, harmonies, predate, bach, but, he, lived, during, a, time, when, modal, music, in, western, tradition, was, largely, supplanted, in, favour, of, the, tonal, system, in, this, system, a, piece, of, music, progresses, from, one, chord, to, the, next, according, to, certain, rules, each, chord, being, characterised, by, four, notes, the, principles, of, four, part, harmony, are, found, not, only, in, bach, s, four, part, choral, music, he, also, prescribes, it, for, instance, for, the, figured, bass, accompaniment, the, new, system, was, at, the, core, of, bach, s, style, and, his, compositions, are, to, a, large, extent, considered, as, laying, down, the, rules, for, the, evolving, scheme, that, would, dominate, musical, expression, in, the, next, centuries, some, examples, of, this, characteristic, of, bach, s, style, and, its, influence, bach, s, insistence, on, the, tonal, system, and, contribution, to, shaping, it, did, not, imply, he, was, less, at, ease, with, the, older, modal, system, and, the, genres, associated, with, it, more, than, his, contemporaries, who, had, moved, on, to, the, tonal, system, without, much, exception, bach, often, returned, to, the, then, antiquated, modi, and, genres, his, chromatic, fantasia, and, fugue, emulating, the, chromatic, fantasia, genre, as, used, by, earlier, composers, such, as, dowland, and, sweelinck, in, d, dorian, mode, comparable, to, d, minor, in, the, tonal, system, is, an, example, of, this, modulation, or, changing, key, in, the, course, of, a, piece, is, another, style, characteristic, where, bach, goes, beyond, what, was, usual, in, his, time, baroque, instruments, vastly, limited, modulation, possibilities, keyboard, instruments, prior, to, a, workable, system, of, temperament, limited, the, keys, that, could, be, modulated, to, and, wind, instruments, especially, brass, instruments, such, as, trumpets, and, horns, about, a, century, before, they, were, fitted, with, valves, were, tied, to, the, key, of, their, tuning, bach, pushed, the, limits, he, added, strange, tones, in, his, organ, playing, confusing, the, singers, according, to, an, indictment, he, had, to, face, in, arnstadt, and, louis, marchand, another, early, experimenter, with, modulation, seems, to, have, avoided, confrontation, with, bach, because, the, latter, went, further, than, anyone, had, done, before, in, the, suscepit, israel, of, his, 1723, magnificat, he, had, the, trumpets, in, e, flat, play, a, melody, in, the, enharmonic, scale, of, c, minor, the, major, development, taking, place, in, bach, s, time, and, to, which, he, contributed, in, no, small, way, was, a, temperament, for, keyboard, instruments, that, allowed, their, use, in, all, available, keys, 12, major, and, 12, minor, and, also, modulation, without, retuning, his, capriccio, on, the, departure, of, a, beloved, brother, a, very, early, work, showed, a, gusto, for, modulation, unlike, any, contemporary, work, this, composition, has, been, compared, to, but, the, full, expansion, came, with, the, well, tempered, clavier, using, all, keys, which, bach, apparently, had, been, developing, since, around, 1720, the, klavierb, chlein, f, r, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, being, one, of, its, earliest, examples, the, second, page, of, the, klavierb, chlein, f, r, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, is, an, ornament, notation, and, performance, guide, that, bach, wrote, for, his, eldest, son, who, was, nine, years, old, at, the, time, bach, was, generally, quite, specific, on, ornamentation, in, his, compositions, where, in, his, time, much, of, the, ornamentation, was, not, written, out, by, composers, but, rather, considered, a, liberty, of, the, performer, and, his, ornamentation, was, often, quite, elaborate, for, instance, the, aria, of, the, goldberg, variations, has, rich, ornamentation, in, nearly, every, measure, bach, s, dealing, with, ornamentation, can, also, be, seen, in, a, keyboard, arrangement, he, made, of, marcello, s, oboe, concerto, he, added, explicit, ornamentation, which, some, centuries, later, is, played, by, oboists, when, performing, the, concerto, although, bach, did, not, write, any, operas, he, was, not, averse, to, the, genre, or, its, ornamented, vocal, style, in, church, music, italian, composers, had, imitated, the, operatic, vocal, style, in, genres, such, as, the, neapolitan, mass, in, protestant, surroundings, there, was, more, reluctance, to, adopt, such, a, style, for, liturgical, music, for, instance, kuhnau, bach, s, predecessor, in, leipzig, had, notoriously, shunned, opera, and, italian, virtuoso, vocal, music, bach, was, less, moved, one, of, the, comments, after, a, performance, of, his, st, matthew, passion, was, that, it, all, sounded, much, like, opera, in, concerted, playing, in, bach, s, time, the, basso, continuo, consisting, of, instruments, such, as, organ, viola, da, gamba, or, harpsichord, usually, had, the, role, of, accompaniment, providing, the, harmonic, and, rhythmic, foundation, of, a, piece, from, the, late, 1720s, bach, had, the, organ, play, concertante, i, e, as, a, soloist, with, the, orchestra, in, instrumental, cantata, movements, a, decade, before, handel, published, his, first, organ, concertos, apart, from, the, 5th, brandenburg, concerto, and, the, triple, concerto, which, already, had, harpsichord, soloists, in, the, 1720s, bach, wrote, and, arranged, his, harpsichord, concertos, in, the, 1730s, and, in, his, sonatas, for, viola, da, gamba, and, harpsichord, neither, instrument, plays, a, continuo, part, they, are, treated, as, equal, soloists, far, beyond, the, figured, bass, in, this, sense, bach, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, genres, such, as, the, keyboard, concerto, bach, wrote, virtuoso, music, for, specific, instruments, as, well, as, music, independent, of, instrumentation, for, instance, the, sonatas, and, partitas, for, solo, violin, are, considered, the, pinnacle, of, what, has, been, written, for, this, instrument, only, within, reach, of, accomplished, players, the, music, fits, the, instrument, pushing, it, to, the, full, scale, of, its, possibilities, and, requiring, the, virtuosity, of, the, player, but, without, bravura, notwithstanding, that, the, music, and, the, instrument, seem, inseparable, bach, made, transcriptions, for, other, instruments, of, some, pieces, of, this, collection, similarly, for, the, cello, suites, the, virtuoso, music, seems, tailored, for, the, instrument, the, best, of, what, is, offered, for, it, yet, bach, made, an, arrangement, for, lute, of, one, of, these, suites, the, same, applies, to, much, of, his, most, virtuoso, keyboard, music, bach, exploited, the, capabilities, of, an, instrument, to, the, fullest, while, keeping, the, core, of, such, music, independent, of, the, instrument, on, which, it, is, performed, in, this, sense, it, is, no, surprise, that, bach, s, music, is, easily, and, often, performed, on, instruments, it, was, not, necessarily, written, for, that, it, is, transcribed, so, often, and, that, his, melodies, turn, up, in, unexpected, places, such, as, jazz, music, apart, from, this, bach, left, several, compositions, without, specified, instrumentation, the, canons, bwv, 1072, 1078, fall, in, that, category, as, well, as, the, bulk, of, the, musical, offering, and, the, art, of, fugue, another, characteristic, of, bach, s, style, is, his, extensive, use, of, counterpoint, as, opposed, to, the, homophony, used, in, his, four, part, chorale, settings, for, example, bach, s, canons, and, especially, his, fugues, are, the, most, characteristic, of, this, style, which, he, did, not, invent, but, contributed, to, so, fundamentally, that, he, defined, it, to, a, large, extent, fugues, are, as, characteristic, to, bach, s, style, as, for, instance, the, sonata, form, is, characteristic, to, the, composers, of, the, classical, period, these, strictly, contrapuntal, compositions, and, most, of, bach, s, music, in, general, are, characterised, by, distinct, melodic, lines, for, each, of, the, voices, where, the, chords, formed, by, the, notes, sounding, at, a, given, point, follow, the, rules, of, four, part, harmony, johann, nikolaus, forkel, bach, s, first, biographer, gives, this, description, of, this, feature, of, bach, s, music, which, sets, it, apart, from, most, other, music, if, the, language, of, music, is, merely, the, utterance, of, a, melodic, line, a, simple, sequence, of, musical, notes, it, can, justly, be, accused, of, poverty, the, addition, of, a, bass, puts, it, upon, a, harmonic, foundation, and, clarifies, it, but, defines, rather, than, gives, it, added, richness, a, melody, so, accompanied, even, though, all, the, notes, are, not, those, of, the, true, bass, or, treated, with, simple, embellishments, in, the, upper, parts, or, with, simple, chords, used, to, be, called, homophony, but, it, is, a, very, different, thing, when, two, melodies, are, so, interwoven, that, they, converse, together, like, two, persons, upon, a, footing, of, pleasant, equality, in, the, first, case, the, accompaniment, is, subordinate, and, serves, merely, to, support, the, first, or, principal, part, in, the, second, case, the, two, parts, are, not, similarly, related, new, melodic, combinations, spring, from, their, interweaving, out, of, which, new, forms, of, musical, expression, emerge, suppose, more, parts, are, interwoven, in, the, same, free, and, independent, manner, in, that, case, the, apparatus, of, language, is, correspondingly, enlarged, and, becomes, practically, inexhaustible, if, in, addition, varieties, of, form, and, rhythm, are, introduced, hence, harmony, becomes, no, longer, a, mere, accompaniment, of, melody, but, rather, a, potent, agency, for, augmenting, the, richness, and, expressiveness, of, musical, conversation, to, serve, that, end, a, simple, accompaniment, will, not, suffice, true, harmony, is, the, interweaving, of, several, melodies, which, emerge, now, in, the, upper, now, in, the, middle, and, now, in, the, lower, parts, from, 1720, when, he, was, thirty, five, until, he, died, in, 1750, bach, s, harmony, consists, of, this, melodic, interweaving, of, independent, melodies, so, perfect, in, their, union, that, each, part, seems, to, constitute, the, true, melody, herein, bach, excels, all, the, composers, in, the, world, at, least, i, have, found, no, one, to, equal, him, in, music, known, to, me, even, in, his, four, part, writing, we, can, not, infrequently, leave, out, the, upper, and, lower, parts, and, still, find, the, middle, parts, harmonious, and, agreeable, bach, devoted, more, attention, than, his, contemporaries, to, the, structure, of, his, compositions, this, can, be, seen, in, minor, adjustments, he, made, when, adapting, someone, else, s, composition, such, as, his, earliest, version, of, the, keiser, st, mark, passion, where, he, enhances, scene, transitions, and, in, the, architecture, of, his, own, compositions, such, as, his, magnificat, and, leipzig, passions, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, bach, revised, several, of, his, prior, compositions, often, recasting, such, previously, composed, music, in, an, enhanced, structure, was, the, most, visible, change, as, in, the, mass, in, b, minor, bach, s, known, preoccupation, with, structure, led, peaking, around, the, 1970s, to, various, numerological, analyses, of, his, compositions, although, many, such, over, interpretations, were, later, rejected, especially, when, wandering, off, into, symbolism, ridden, hermeneutics, the, librettos, or, lyrics, of, his, vocal, compositions, played, an, essential, role, for, bach, he, sought, collaboration, with, various, text, authors, for, his, cantatas, and, major, vocal, compositions, possibly, writing, or, adapting, such, texts, himself, to, make, them, fit, the, structure, of, the, composition, he, was, designing, when, he, could, not, rely, on, the, talents, of, other, text, authors, his, collaboration, with, picander, for, the, st, matthew, passion, libretto, is, best, known, however, there, was, a, similar, process, in, achieving, a, multi, layered, structure, for, his, st, john, passion, libretto, a, few, years, earlier, in, 1950, wolfgang, schmieder, published, a, thematic, catalogue, of, bach, s, compositions, called, the, bach, werke, verzeichnis, bach, works, catalogue, schmieder, largely, followed, the, bach, gesellschaft, ausgabe, a, comprehensive, edition, of, the, composer, s, works, that, was, produced, between, 1850, and, 1900, the, first, edition, of, the, catalogue, listed, 1, 080, surviving, compositions, indisputably, composed, by, bach, bwv, 1081, 1126, were, added, to, the, catalogue, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, bwv, 1127, and, higher, are, 21st, century, additions, bach, composed, passions, for, good, friday, services, and, oratorios, such, as, the, christmas, oratorio, which, is, a, set, of, six, cantatas, for, use, in, the, liturgical, season, of, christmas, shorter, oratorios, include, the, easter, oratorio, and, the, ascension, oratorio, with, its, double, choir, and, orchestra, the, st, matthew, passion, is, one, of, bach, s, most, extended, works, the, st, john, passion, was, the, first, passion, bach, composed, during, his, tenure, as, thomaskantor, in, leipzig, according, to, his, obituary, bach, would, have, composed, five, year, cycles, of, sacred, cantatas, and, additional, church, cantatas, for, weddings, and, funerals, approximately, 200, of, these, sacred, works, are, extant, an, estimated, two, thirds, of, the, total, number, of, church, cantatas, he, composed, the, bach, digital, website, lists, 50, known, secular, cantatas, by, the, composer, about, half, of, which, are, extant, or, largely, reconstructable, bach, s, cantatas, vary, greatly, in, form, and, instrumentation, many, consist, of, a, large, opening, chorus, followed, by, one, or, more, recitative, aria, pairs, for, soloists, or, duets, and, a, concluding, chorale, the, melody, of, the, concluding, chorale, often, appears, as, a, cantus, firmus, in, the, opening, movement, bach, s, earliest, cantatas, date, from, his, years, in, arnstadt, and, m, hlhausen, the, earliest, surviving, work, in, the, genre, is, nach, dir, herr, verlanget, mich, bwv, 150, overall, the, extant, early, works, show, remarkable, mastery, and, skill, many, feature, an, instrumental, opening, which, displays, effective, use, of, the, limited, instrumental, forces, available, to, bach, whether, it, be, in, the, subdued, combination, of, two, recorders, and, two, violas, de, gamba, for, bwv, 106, or, the, independent, bassoon, in, bwv, 196, bach, s, compositional, skills, also, manifest, through, his, daring, harmonies, and, advanced, unprecedented, chord, progressions, according, to, christoph, wolff, bach, s, early, cantatas, are, impressive, evidence, of, how, the, modest, means, at, his, disposal, did, not, restrain, the, composer, in, the, slightest, and, they, compare, favourably, with, compositions, by, the, most, talented, composers, from, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, such, as, krieger, kuhnau, or, zachow, after, taking, up, his, office, as, thomaskantor, in, late, may, 1723, bach, performed, a, cantata, each, sunday, and, feast, day, corresponding, to, the, lectionary, readings, of, the, week, his, first, cantata, cycle, ran, from, the, first, sunday, after, trinity, of, 1723, to, trinity, sunday, the, next, year, for, instance, the, visitation, cantata, herz, und, mund, und, tat, und, leben, bwv, 147, containing, the, chorale, that, is, known, in, english, as, jesu, joy, of, man, s, desiring, belongs, to, this, first, cycle, the, cantata, cycle, of, his, second, year, in, leipzig, is, called, the, chorale, cantata, cycle, as, it, consists, mainly, of, works, in, the, chorale, cantata, format, his, third, cantata, cycle, was, developed, over, several, years, followed, by, the, picander, cycle, of, 1728, 29, later, church, cantatas, include, the, chorale, cantatas, ein, feste, burg, ist, unser, gott, bwv, 80, final, version, and, wachet, auf, ruft, uns, die, stimme, bwv, 140, only, the, first, three, leipzig, cycles, are, more, or, less, completely, extant, apart, from, his, own, work, bach, also, performed, cantatas, by, telemann, and, by, his, distant, relative, johann, ludwig, bach, bach, also, wrote, secular, cantatas, for, instance, for, members, of, the, royal, polish, and, prince, electoral, saxonian, families, e, g, trauer, ode, or, other, public, or, private, occasions, e, g, hunting, cantata, the, text, of, these, cantatas, was, occasionally, in, dialect, e, g, peasant, cantata, or, italian, e, g, amore, traditore, many, of, the, secular, cantatas, were, lost, but, for, some, of, them, the, text, and, occasion, are, known, for, instance, when, picander, later, published, their, librettos, e, g, bwv, anh, 11, 12, some, of, the, surviving, secular, cantatas, have, a, plot, involving, mythological, figures, of, greek, antiquity, e, g, der, streit, zwischen, phoebus, und, pan, and, others, were, almost, miniature, buffo, operas, e, g, coffee, cantata, although, bach, never, expressed, any, interest, in, opera, his, secular, cantatas, or, drammi, per, musica, would, have, allowed, leipzig, audiences, deprived, of, opera, since, 1720, to, experience, musical, performances, comparable, to, the, royal, opera, in, dresden, these, were, not, poor, or, makeshift, substitutes, for, real, opera, but, spectacles, displaying, full, mastery, of, the, dramatic, genre, and, the, proper, pacing, of, the, dialogues, bach, s, a, cappella, music, includes, motets, and, chorale, harmonisations, bach, s, motets, bwv, 225, 231, are, pieces, on, sacred, themes, for, choir, and, continuo, with, instruments, playing, colla, parte, several, of, them, were, composed, for, funerals, the, six, motets, definitely, composed, by, bach, are, singet, dem, herrn, ein, neues, lied, der, geist, hilft, unser, schwachheit, auf, jesu, meine, freude, f, rchte, dich, nicht, komm, jesu, komm, and, lobet, den, herrn, alle, heiden, the, motet, sei, lob, und, preis, mit, ehren, bwv, 231, is, part, of, the, composite, motet, jauchzet, dem, herrn, alle, welt, bwv, anh, 160, other, parts, of, which, may, be, based, on, work, by, telemann, bach, wrote, hundreds, of, four, part, harmonisations, of, lutheran, chorales, bach, s, church, music, in, latin, includes, the, magnificat, four, kyrie, gloria, masses, and, the, mass, in, b, minor, the, first, version, of, bach, s, magnificat, dates, from, 1723, but, the, work, is, best, known, in, its, d, major, version, of, 1733, in, 1733, bach, composed, a, kyrie, gloria, mass, for, the, dresden, court, near, the, end, of, his, life, around, 1748, 1749, he, expanded, this, composition, into, the, large, scale, mass, in, b, minor, the, work, was, never, performed, in, full, during, bach, s, lifetime, bach, wrote, for, organ, and, for, stringed, keyboard, instruments, such, as, harpsichord, clavichord, and, lute, harpsichord, bach, was, best, known, during, his, lifetime, as, an, organist, organ, consultant, and, composer, of, organ, works, in, both, the, traditional, german, free, genres, such, as, preludes, fantasias, and, toccatas, and, stricter, forms, such, as, chorale, preludes, and, fugues, at, a, young, age, he, established, a, reputation, for, creativity, and, the, ability, to, integrate, foreign, styles, into, his, organ, works, a, decidedly, north, german, influence, was, exerted, by, georg, b, hm, with, whom, bach, came, into, contact, in, l, neburg, and, dieterich, buxtehude, whom, the, young, organist, visited, in, l, beck, in, 1704, on, an, extended, leave, of, absence, from, his, job, in, arnstadt, around, this, time, bach, copied, the, works, of, numerous, french, and, italian, composers, to, gain, insights, into, their, compositional, languages, and, later, arranged, violin, concertos, by, vivaldi, and, others, for, organ, and, harpsichord, during, his, most, productive, period, 1708, 1714, he, composed, about, a, dozen, pairs, of, preludes, and, fugues, five, toccatas, and, fugues, and, the, orgelb, chlein, or, little, organ, book, an, unfinished, collection, of, 46, short, chorale, preludes, that, demonstrate, compositional, techniques, in, the, setting, of, chorale, tunes, after, leaving, weimar, bach, wrote, less, for, organ, although, some, of, his, best, known, works, the, six, organ, sonatas, the, german, organ, mass, in, clavier, bung, iii, from, 1739, and, the, great, eighteen, chorale, preludes, revised, late, in, his, life, were, composed, after, leaving, weimar, later, in, his, life, bach, extensively, consulted, on, organ, projects, tested, new, organs, and, dedicated, playing, organs, to, afternoon, recitals, the, canonic, variations, on, vom, himmel, hoch, da, komm, ich, her, and, the, sch, bler, chorales, are, organ, works, bach, published, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, bach, wrote, many, works, for, harpsichord, some, of, which, may, also, have, been, played, on, the, clavichord, or, lute, harpsichord, some, of, his, more, significant, works, such, as, clavier, bung, ii, and, iv, are, intended, for, a, harpsichord, with, two, manuals, performing, them, on, a, keyboard, instrument, with, a, single, manual, like, a, piano, may, present, technical, difficulties, for, the, crossing, of, hands, among, bach, s, lesser, known, keyboard, works, are, seven, toccatas, bwv, 910, 916, four, duets, bwv, 802, 805, sonatas, for, keyboard, bwv, 963, 967, the, six, little, preludes, bwv, 933, 938, and, the, aria, variata, alla, maniera, italiana, bwv, 989, bach, wrote, for, single, instruments, duets, and, small, ensembles, many, of, his, solo, works, such, as, the, six, sonatas, and, partitas, for, violin, bwv, 1001, 1006, and, the, six, cello, suites, bwv, 1007, 1012, are, widely, considered, to, be, among, the, most, profound, in, the, repertoire, he, wrote, sonatas, for, a, solo, instrument, such, as, the, viola, de, gamba, accompanied, by, harpsichord, or, continuo, as, well, as, trio, sonatas, two, instruments, and, continuo, the, musical, offering, and, the, art, of, fugue, are, late, contrapuntal, works, containing, pieces, for, unspecified, or, combinations, of, instruments, surviving, works, in, the, concerto, form, include, two, violin, concertos, bwv, 1041, in, a, minor, and, bwv, 1042, in, e, major, and, a, concerto, for, two, violins, in, d, minor, bwv, 1043, often, referred, to, as, bach, s, double, concerto, bach, s, best, known, orchestral, works, are, the, brandenburg, concertos, so, named, because, he, submitted, them, in, the, hope, of, gaining, employment, from, margrave, christian, ludwig, of, brandenburg, schwedt, in, 1721, his, application, was, unsuccessful, these, works, are, examples, of, the, concerto, grosso, genre, bach, composed, and, transcribed, concertos, for, one, to, four, harpsichords, many, of, the, harpsichord, concertos, were, not, original, works, but, arrangements, of, his, concertos, for, other, instruments, are, now, lost, several, violin, oboe, and, flute, concertos, have, been, reconstructed, from, these, in, addition, to, concertos, bach, wrote, four, orchestral, suites, each, suite, being, a, series, of, stylised, dances, for, orchestra, preceded, by, a, french, overture, in, his, early, youth, bach, copied, pieces, by, other, composers, to, learn, from, them, later, he, copied, and, arranged, music, for, performance, or, as, study, material, for, his, pupils, some, of, these, pieces, like, bist, du, bei, mir, copied, not, by, bach, but, by, anna, magdalena, became, famous, before, being, dissociated, with, bach, bach, copied, and, arranged, italian, masters, such, as, vivaldi, e, g, bwv, 1065, pergolesi, bwv, 1083, and, palestrina, missa, sine, nomine, french, masters, such, as, fran, ois, couperin, bwv, anh, 183, and, closer, to, home, various, german, masters, including, telemann, e, g, bwv, 824, twv, 32, 14, and, handel, arias, from, brockes, passion, and, music, from, members, of, his, own, family, he, also, often, copied, and, arranged, his, own, music, e, g, movements, from, cantatas, for, his, short, masses, bwv, 233, 236, as, his, music, was, likewise, copied, and, arranged, by, others, some, of, these, arrangements, like, the, late, 19th, century, air, on, the, g, string, helped, to, popularise, bach, s, music, sometimes, who, copied, whom, is, not, clear, for, instance, forkel, mentions, a, mass, for, double, chorus, among, the, works, composed, by, bach, the, work, was, published, and, performed, in, the, early, 19th, century, although, a, score, partially, in, bach, s, handwriting, exists, the, work, was, later, considered, spurious, in, 1950, the, design, of, the, bach, werke, verzeichnis, was, to, keep, such, works, out, of, the, main, catalogue, if, there, was, a, strong, association, with, bach, they, could, be, listed, in, its, appendix, german, anhang, abbreviated, as, anh, thus, for, instance, the, aforementioned, mass, for, double, chorus, became, bwv, anh, 167, but, this, was, far, from, the, end, of, the, attribution, issues, for, instance, schlage, doch, gew, nschte, stunde, bwv, 53, was, later, attributed, to, melchior, hoffmann, for, other, works, bach, s, authorship, was, put, in, doubt, without, a, generally, accepted, answer, to, the, question, of, whether, or, not, he, composed, it, the, best, known, organ, composition, in, the, bwv, catalogue, the, toccata, and, fugue, in, d, minor, bwv, 565, was, indicated, as, one, of, these, uncertain, works, in, the, late, 20th, century, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, appreciation, of, bach, s, music, was, mostly, limited, to, distinguished, connoisseurs, the, 19th, century, started, with, the, publication, of, the, first, biography, of, the, composer, and, ended, with, the, completion, and, publication, of, all, of, bach, s, known, works, by, the, bach, gesellschaft, starting, with, the, bach, revival, he, began, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, composers, a, reputation, he, has, maintained, ever, since, the, bach, motif, used, by, the, composer, in, his, own, compositions, was, used, in, dozens, of, tributes, to, the, composer, from, the, 19th, century, to, the, 21st, in, his, own, time, bach, was, highly, regarded, amongst, his, colleagues, however, his, reputation, outside, of, this, small, circle, of, connoisseurs, was, due, not, to, his, compositions, which, had, an, extremely, narrow, circulation, but, due, to, his, virtuosic, abilities, nevertheless, during, his, life, bach, received, public, recognition, such, as, the, title, of, court, composer, by, augustus, iii, of, poland, and, the, appreciation, he, was, shown, by, frederick, the, great, and, hermann, karl, von, keyserling, such, highly, placed, appreciation, contrasted, with, the, humiliations, he, had, to, cope, with, for, instance, in, leipzig, also, in, the, contemporary, press, bach, had, his, detractors, such, as, johann, adolf, scheibe, suggesting, he, write, less, complex, music, and, his, supporters, such, as, johann, mattheson, and, lorenz, christoph, mizler, after, his, death, bach, s, reputation, as, a, composer, initially, declined, his, work, was, regarded, as, old, fashioned, compared, to, the, emerging, galant, style, he, was, remembered, more, as, a, virtuoso, organ, player, and, a, teacher, the, bulk, of, the, music, that, had, been, printed, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, at, least, the, remembered, parts, was, for, the, organ, and, the, harpsichord, thus, his, reputation, as, a, composer, was, initially, mostly, limited, to, his, keyboard, music, which, was, relatively, limited, in, its, value, to, music, education, bach, s, surviving, family, members, who, inherited, a, large, part, of, his, manuscripts, were, not, all, equally, concerned, with, preserving, them, leading, to, considerable, losses, carl, philipp, emanuel, his, second, eldest, son, was, most, active, in, safeguarding, his, father, s, legacy, he, co, authored, his, father, s, obituary, contributed, to, the, publication, of, his, four, part, chorales, staged, some, of, his, works, and, the, bulk, of, previously, unpublished, works, of, his, father, were, preserved, with, his, help, wilhelm, friedemann, the, eldest, son, performed, several, of, his, father, s, cantatas, in, halle, but, after, becoming, unemployed, sold, part, of, the, large, collection, of, his, father, s, works, he, owned, several, students, of, the, old, master, such, as, his, son, in, law, johann, christoph, altnickol, johann, friedrich, agricola, johann, kirnberger, and, johann, ludwig, krebs, contributed, to, the, dissemination, of, his, legacy, the, early, devotees, were, not, all, musicians, for, example, in, berlin, daniel, itzig, a, high, official, of, frederick, the, great, s, court, venerated, bach, his, eldest, daughters, took, lessons, from, kirnberger, and, their, sister, sara, from, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, who, was, in, berlin, from, 1774, to, 1784, sara, itzig, levy, became, an, avid, collector, of, works, by, johann, sebastian, bach, and, his, sons, and, was, a, patron, of, cpe, bach, while, in, leipzig, performances, of, bach, s, church, music, were, limited, to, some, of, his, motets, and, under, cantor, doles, some, of, his, passions, a, new, generation, of, bach, aficionados, emerged, they, studiously, collected, and, copied, his, music, including, some, of, his, large, scale, works, such, as, the, mass, in, b, minor, and, performed, it, privately, one, such, connoisseur, was, gottfried, van, swieten, a, high, ranking, austrian, official, who, was, instrumental, in, passing, bach, s, legacy, on, to, the, composers, of, the, viennese, school, haydn, owned, manuscript, copies, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, and, the, mass, in, b, minor, and, was, influenced, by, bach, s, music, mozart, owned, a, copy, of, one, of, bach, s, motets, transcribed, some, of, his, instrumental, works, k, 404a, 405, and, wrote, contrapuntal, music, influenced, by, his, style, beethoven, played, the, entire, well, tempered, clavier, by, the, time, he, was, 11, and, described, bach, as, urvater, der, harmonie, progenitor, of, harmony, in, 1802, johann, nikolaus, forkel,

in, b, minor, the, greatest, composition, ever, bach, s, influence, was, felt, in, the, next, generation, of, early, romantic, composers, when, abraham, s, son, felix, aged, 13, produced, his, first, magnificat, setting, in, 1822, it, is, clear, that, he, had, been, inspired, by, the, then, unpublished, d, major, version, of, bach, s, magnificat, felix, mendelssohn, s, 1829, performance, of, the, st, matthew, passion, precipitated, the, bach, revival, the, st, john, passion, saw, its, 19th, century, premiere, in, 1833, and, the, first, public, performance, of, the, mass, in, b, minor,
