spain, and, the, spanish, people, were, upset, by, the, presence, of, the, french, troops, as, a, result, of, the, numerous, excesses, that, the, french, committed, against, the, spanish, people, such, as, occupation, of, the, territory, numerous, looting, pillaging, murder, of, civilians, and, the, kidnappings, of, king, charles, iv, and, prince, ferdinan, vii, also, napoleon, forced, both, to, abdicate, and, installed, his, brother, joseph, bonaparte, as, king, of, spain, this, triggered, a, revolt, by, spanish, troops, first, and, subsequently, an, uprising, in, madrid, this, was, followed, by, further, revolts, across, spain, in, august, 1808, a, british, army, landed, in, portugal, britain, and, france, then, went, to, war, against, each, other, in, portugal, and, spain, the, war, and, instability, in, spain, affected, mexico, and, other, parts, of, new, spain, in, 1803, aged, 50, he, arrived, in, dolores, accompanied, by, his, family, that, included, a, younger, brother, a, cousin, two, half, sisters, as, well, as, mar, a, and, their, two, children, he, obtained, this, parish, in, spite, of, his, hearing, before, the, inquisition, which, did, not, stop, his, secular, practices, after, hidalgo, settled, in, dolores, he, turned, over, most, of, the, clerical, duties, to, one, of, his, vicars, francisco, iglesias, and, devoted, himself, almost, exclusively, to, commerce, intellectual, pursuits, and, humanitarian, activities, he, spent, much, of, his, time, studying, literature, scientific, works, grape, cultivation, and, the, raising, of, silkworms, he, used, the, knowledge, that, he, gained, to, promote, economic, activities, for, the, poor, and, rural, people, in, his, area, he, established, factories, to, make, bricks, and, pottery, and, trained, indigenous, people, in, the, making, of, leather, he, promoted, beekeeping, he, was, interested, in, promoting, activities, of, commercial, value, to, use, the, natural, resources, of, the, area, to, help, the, poor, his, goal, was, to, make, the, indigenous, and, mestizos, more, self, reliant, however, these, activities, violated, mercantilist, policies, designed, to, protect, agriculture, and, industry, in, spain, and, hidalgo, was, ordered, to, stop, them, these, policies, as, well, as, exploitation, of, mixed, race, castas, fostered, animosity, in, hidalgo, towards, the, peninsular, born, spaniards, in, mexico, in, addition, to, restricting, economic, activities, in, new, spain, spanish, mercantile, practices, caused, misery, for, native, peoples, a, drought, in, 1807, 1808, caused, a, famine, in, the, dolores, area, and, rather, than, releasing, stored, grain, to, market, spanish, merchants, blocked, its, release, speculating, on, price, increases, hidalgo, lobbied, against, these, practices, but, was, not, successful, fearing, his, arrest, hidalgo, commanded, his, brother, mauricio, as, well, as, ignacio, allende, and, mariano, abasolo, to, go, with, a, number, of, other, armed, men, to, make, the, sheriff, release, prison, inmates, in, dolores, on, the, night, of, 15, september, 1810, setting, eighty, free, on, the, morning, of, 16, september, 1810, hidalgo, celebrated, mass, which, was, attended, by, about, 300, people, including, hacienda, owners, local, politicians, and, spaniards, there, he, gave, what, is, now, known, as, the, grito, de, dolores, cry, of, dolores, calling, the, people, of, his, parish, to, leave, their, homes, and, join, with, him, in, a, rebellion, against, the, current, government, in, the, name, of, their, king, ferdinand, vii, hidalgo, s, grito, did, not, condemn, the, notion, of, monarchy, or, criticize, the, current, social, order, in, detail, but, his, opposition, to, the, events, in, spain, and, the, current, viceregal, government, was, clearly, expressed, in, his, reference, to, bad, government, the, grito, also, emphasized, loyalty, to, the, catholic, religion, a, sentiment, with, which, both, creoles, and, peninsulares, could, sympathize, hidalgo, was, met, with, an, outpouring, of, support, intellectuals, liberal, priests, and, many, poor, people, followed, hidalgo, with, enthusiasm, his, movement, was, joined, by, mestizos, and, the, indigenous, in, such, numbers, that, the, original, motives, of, the, quer, taro, group, were, obscured, ignacio, allende, hidalgo, s, main, co, conspirator, in, quer, taro, remained, more, loyal, to, the, quer, taro, group, s, original, criollo, centered, objectives, however, hidalgo, s, actions, and, the, people, s, response, meant, he, would, lead, and, not, allende, allende, had, acquired, military, training, when, new, spain, established, a, colonial, militia, whereas, hidalgo, had, none, the, insurgents, who, followed, hidalgo, also, had, no, military, training, experience, or, equipment, many, of, these, people, were, poor, who, were, angry, after, many, years, of, hunger, and, oppression, consequently, hidalgo, was, the, leader, of, undisciplined, rebels, hidalgo, s, leadership, gave, the, insurgent, movement, a, supernatural, aspect, many, villagers, that, joined, the, insurgent, army, came, to, believe, that, fernando, vii, himself, commanded, their, loyalty, to, hidalgo, and, the, monarch, was, in, new, spain, personally, directing, the, rebellion, against, the, viceroyalty, historian, eric, van, young, believes, that, such, ideas, gave, the, movement, supernatural, and, religious, legitimacy, that, went, as, far, as, messianic, expectation, hidalgo, and, allende, left, dolores, with, about, 800, men, half, of, whom, were, on, horseback, they, marched, through, the, baj, o, area, through, atotonilco, san, miguel, el, grande, present, day, san, miguel, de, allende, chamucuero, celaya, salamanca, irapuato, and, silao, to, guanajuato, from, guanajuato, hidalgo, directed, his, troops, to, valladolid, michoac, n, they, remained, here, for, a, while, and, eventually, marched, towards, mexico, city, from, valladolid, they, marched, through, the, state, of, mexico, through, the, cities, of, maravatio, ixtlahuaca, toluca, coming, as, close, to, mexico, city, as, the, monte, de, las, cruces, between, the, valley, of, toluca, and, the, valley, of, mexico, through, numbers, hidalgo, s, army, had, some, early, victories, hidalgo, first, went, through, the, economically, important, and, densely, populated, province, of, guanajuato, one, of, the, first, stops, was, at, the, sanctuary, of, nuestra, se, ora, de, guadalupe, in, atotonilco, where, hidalgo, affixed, an, image, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, to, a, lance, to, adopt, it, as, his, banner, he, inscribed, the, following, slogans, to, his, troops, flags, long, live, religion, long, live, our, most, holy, mother, of, guadalupe, long, live, america, and, death, to, bad, government, for, the, insurgents, as, a, whole, the, virgin, represented, an, intense, and, highly, localized, religious, sensibility, invoked, more, to, identify, allies, rather, than, create, ideological, alliances, or, a, sense, of, nationalism, the, extent, and, the, intensity, of, the, movement, took, colonial, authorities, by, surprise, san, miguel, and, celaya, were, captured, with, little, resistance, on, 21, september, 1810, hidalgo, was, proclaimed, general, and, supreme, commander, after, arriving, to, celaya, at, this, point, hidalgo, s, army, numbered, about, 5, 000, however, because, of, the, lack, of, discipline, the, insurgents, soon, fell, into, robbing, looting, ransacking, towns, and, executing, prisoners, this, caused, friction, between, allende, and, hidalgo, as, early, as, the, capture, of, san, miguel, in, late, september, 1810, when, rioting, ran, through, the, city, allende, tried, to, break, up, violence, by, striking, insurgents, with, the, flat, of, his, sword, which, brought, him, a, rebuke, from, hidalgo, on, 28, september, 1810, hidalgo, arrived, at, the, city, of, guanajuato, with, rebels, who, were, mostly, armed, with, sticks, stones, and, machetes, the, town, s, peninsular, and, criollo, populations, took, refuge, in, the, fortified, alh, ndiga, de, granaditas, commanded, by, juan, antonio, de, ria, o, the, insurgents, overwhelmed, the, defenses, after, two, days, and, killed, an, estimated, 400, 600, people, allende, strongly, protested, these, events, and, while, hidalgo, agreed, that, they, were, heinous, he, also, stated, that, he, understood, the, historical, patterns, that, shaped, such, responses, the, attacks, prompted, criollos, and, peninsulares, to, ally, against, the, insurgents, and, caused, hidalgo, to, lose, support, from, liberal, criollos, from, guanajuato, hidalgo, set, off, for, valladolid, on, 10, october, 1810, with, 15, 000, men, when, he, arrived, at, ac, mbaro, he, was, promoted, to, generalissimo, and, given, the, title, of, his, most, serene, highness, with, power, to, legislate, with, his, new, rank, he, had, a, blue, uniform, with, a, clerical, collar, and, red, lapels, embroidered, with, silver, and, gold, his, uniform, also, included, a, black, baldric, also, embroidered, with, gold, there, was, also, a, large, image, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, in, gold, on, his, chest, hidalgo, and, his, forces, took, valladolid, with, little, opposition, on, 17, october, 1810, there, hidalgo, issued, proclamations, against, the, peninsulares, whom, he, accused, of, arrogance, and, despotism, as, well, as, enslaving, those, in, the, americas, for, almost, 300, years, hidalgo, argued, that, the, objective, of, the, war, was, to, send, the, gachupines, back, to, the, motherland, accusing, their, greed, and, tyranny, as, leading, to, the, temporal, and, spiritual, degradation, of, mexicans, hidalgo, forced, the, bishop, elect, of, michoacan, manuel, abad, y, queipo, to, rescind, the, excommunication, order, he, had, circulated, against, him, on, 24, september, 1810, later, the, inquisition, issued, an, excommunication, edict, on, 13, october, 1810, condemning, hidalgo, as, a, seditionary, apostate, and, heretic, the, insurgents, stayed, in, the, city, preparing, to, march, to, the, capital, of, new, spain, mexico, city, the, canon, of, the, cathedral, met, hidalgo, and, made, him, promise, that, the, atrocities, of, san, miguel, celaya, and, guanajuato, would, not, be, repeated, in, valladolid, wholesale, destruction, of, the, city, was, not, repeated, however, hidalgo, was, furious, when, he, found, the, cathedral, locked, to, him, which, led, him, to, jail, spaniards, replace, city, officials, with, his, own, and, looting, the, city, treasury, before, marching, off, toward, mexico, city, on, 19, october, hidalgo, left, valladolid, for, mexico, city, after, taking, 400, 000, pesos, from, the, cathedral, to, pay, expenses, hidalgo, and, his, troops, left, the, state, of, michoac, n, and, marched, through, the, towns, of, maravatio, ixtlahuaca, and, toluca, before, stopping, in, the, forested, mountain, area, of, monte, de, las, cruces, here, insurgent, forces, engaged, torcuato, trujillo, s, royalist, forces, hidalgo, s, troops, led, the, royalist, troops, to, retreat, but, the, insurgents, suffered, heavy, casualties, as, they, had, when, they, engaged, royalist, soldiers, in, guanajuato, after, the, battle, of, monte, de, las, cruces, on, 30, october, 1810, hidalgo, had, some, 100, 000, insurgents, and, was, in, a, strategic, position, to, attack, mexico, city, numerically, his, forces, outnumbered, royalist, forces, the, royalist, government, in, mexico, city, under, the, leadership, of, viceroy, francisco, venegas, prepared, psychological, and, military, defenses, an, intensive, propaganda, campaign, had, advertised, insurgent, violence, in, the, baj, o, region, and, stressed, the, insurgents, threat, against, social, stability, hidalgo, s, insurgency, also, faced, opposition, from, sedentary, natives, and, castes, of, the, valley, of, mexico, hidalgo, s, forces, came, as, close, as, what, is, now, the, cuajimalpa, borough, of, mexico, city, allende, wanted, to, press, forward, and, attack, the, capital, but, hidalgo, disagreed, hidalgo, s, reasoning, for, this, decision, is, unclear, and, has, been, debated, by, historians, one, explanation, is, that, hidalgo, s, forces, were, undisciplined, and, had, suffered, heavy, losses, whenever, they, encountered, trained, troops, as, the, capital, was, guarded, by, some, of, the, most, trained, soldiers, in, new, spain, hidalgo, decided, to, turn, away, from, mexico, city, and, move, to, the, north, through, toluca, and, ixtlahuaca, with, a, destination, of, guadalajara, after, turning, back, many, insurgents, deserted, by, the, time, he, got, to, aculco, just, north, of, toluca, his, army, had, shrunk, to, 40, 000, men, new, spain, general, felix, calleja, attacked, hidalgo, s, forces, defeating, them, on, 7, november, 1810, allende, decided, to, take, the, troops, under, his, command, to, guanajuato, instead, of, guadalajara, hidalgo, arrived, in, guadalajara, on, 26, november, with, more, than, 7, 000, poorly, armed, troops, he, initially, occupied, the, city, with, lower, class, support, because, hidalgo, promised, to, end, slavery, tribute, payment, and, taxes, on, alcohol, and, tobacco, hidalgo, established, an, alternative, government, in, guadalajara, with, himself, at, the, head, and, appointed, two, ministers, on, 6, december, 1810, hidalgo, issued, a, decree, abolishing, slavery, threatening, those, who, did, not, comply, with, death, he, abolished, tribute, payments, that, indigenous, peoples, had, to, pay, to, criollo, and, peninsular, lords, he, ordered, the, publication, of, a, newspaper, called, despertador, americano, american, wake, up, call, he, named, pascacio, ortiz, de, letona, as, representative, of, the, insurgent, government, and, sent, him, to, the, united, states, to, seek, support, but, ortiz, de, letona, was, apprehended, by, the, spanish, army, and, executed, during, this, time, insurgent, violence, mounted, in, guadalajara, citizens, loyal, to, the, viceregal, government, were, seized, and, executed, while, indiscriminate, looting, was, avoided, insurgents, targeted, properties, of, criollos, and, spaniards, regardless, of, political, affiliation, in, the, meantime, the, royalist, army, had, retaken, guanajuato, forcing, allende, to, flee, to, guadalajara, after, he, arrived, at, the, city, allende, again, objected, to, hidalgo, concerning, the, insurgent, violence, however, hidalgo, knew, the, royalist, army, was, on, its, way, to, guadalajara, and, wanted, to, stay, on, good, terms, with, his, own, army, after, guanajuato, had, been, retaken, by, royalist, forces, bishop, manuel, abad, y, queipo, excommunicated, hidalgo, and, those, following, or, helping, him, on, 24, december, 1810, abad, y, queipo, had, formerly, been, a, friend, of, hidalgo, but, he, was, adamantly, opposed, to, hidalgo, s, tactics, and, the, resultant, disruptions, alleged, sacrileges, and, purported, ill, treatment, of, priests, the, inquisition, pronounced, an, edict, against, hidalgo, charging, him, with, denying, that, god, punishes, sins, in, this, world, doubting, the, authenticity, of, the, bible, denouncing, the, popes, and, church, government, allowing, jews, not, to, convert, to, christianity, denying, the, perpetual, virginity, of, mary, preaching, that, there, was, no, hell, and, adopting, lutheran, doctrine, with, regard, to, the, eucharist, hidalgo, responded, that, he, had, never, departed, from, church, doctrine, in, the, slightest, degree, royalist, forces, marched, to, guadalajara, arriving, in, january, 1811, with, nearly, 6, 000, men, allende, and, abasolo, wanted, to, concentrate, their, forces, in, the, city, and, plan, an, escape, route, should, they, be, defeated, but, hidalgo, rejected, this, deciding, to, make, a, stand, at, the, calder, n, bridge, puente, de, calder, n, just, outside, the, city, hidalgo, had, between, 80, 000, and, 100, 000, men, and, 95, cannons, but, the, better, trained, royalists, decisively, defeated, the, insurgent, army, forcing, hidalgo, to, flee, towards, aguascalientes, at, hacienda, de, pabell, n, on, 25, january, 1811, near, the, city, of, aguascalientes, allende, and, other, insurgent, leaders, took, military, command, away, from, hidalgo, blaming, him, for, their, defeats, hidalgo, remained, as, head, politically, but, with, military, command, going, to, allende, the, insurgent, army, moved, north, towards, zacatecas, and, saltillo, with, the, goal, of, making, connections, in, the, united, states, for, support, hidalgo, reached, saltillo, where, he, publicly,
