collection, the, prodigal, in, 2004, i, was, born, and, grew, up, in, the, baltic, marshland, by, zinc, gray, breakers, that, always, marched, on, in, twos, from, the, title, poem, in, a, part, of, speech, 1977, brodsky, is, perhaps, most, known, for, his, poetry, collections, a, part, of, speech, 1977, and, to, urania, 1988, and, the, essay, collection, less, than, one, 1986, which, won, the, national, book, critics, circle, award, other, notable, works, include, the, play, marbles, 1989, and, watermark, 1992, a, prose, meditation, on, venice, throughout, his, career, he, wrote, in,

described, brodsky, as, a, traditionalist, lyric, poet, fascinated, by, encounters, with, nature, reflections, upon, the, human, condition, death, and, the, meaning, of, existence, he, drew, on, wide, ranging, themes, from, mexican, and, caribbean, literature, to, roman, poetry, mixing, the, physical, and, the, metaphysical, place, and, ideas, about, place, now, and, the, past, and, the, future, critic, dinah, birch, suggests, that, brodsky, s, first, volume, of, poetry, in, english, joseph, brodsky, selected, poems, 1973, shows, that, although, his, strength, was, a, distinctive, kind, of, dry, meditative, soliloquy, he, was, immensely, versatile, and, technically, accomplished, in, a, number, of, forms, to, urania, selected, poems, 1965, 1985, collected, translations, of, older, work, with, new, work, written, during, his, american, exile, and, reflect, on, themes, of, memory, home, and, loss, his, two, essay, collections, consist, of, critical, studies, of, such, poets, as, osip, mandelshtam, w, h, auden, thomas, hardy, rainer, maria, rilke, and, robert, frost, sketches, of, his, own, life, and, those, of, contemporaries, such, as, akhmatova, nadezhda, mandelshtam, and, stephen, spender, a, recurring, theme, in, brodsky, s, writing, is, the, relationship, between, the, poet, and, society, in, particular, brodsky, emphasized, the, power, of, literature, to, affect, its, audience, positively, and, to, develop, the, language, and, culture, in, which, it, is, situated, he, suggested, that, the, western, literary, tradition, was, in, part, responsible, for, the, world, having, overcome, the, catastrophes, of, the, twentieth, century, such, as, nazism, communism, and, two, world, wars, during, his, term, as, poet, laureate, brodsky, promoted, the, idea, of, bringing, the, anglo, american, poetic, heritage, to, a, wider, american, audience, by, distributing, free, poetry, anthologies, to, the, public, through, a, government, sponsored, program, librarian, of, congress, james, billington, wrote, joseph, had, difficulty, understanding, why, poetry, did, not, draw, the, large, audiences, in, the, united, states, that, it, did, in, russia, he, was, proud, of, becoming, an, american, citizen, in, 1977, the, soviets, having, made, him, stateless, upon, his, expulsion, in, 1972, and, valued, the, freedoms, that, life, in, the, united, states, provided, but, he, regarded, poetry, as, language, s, highest, degree, of, maturity, and, wanted, everyone, to, be, susceptible, to, it, as, poet, laureate, he, suggested, that, inexpensive, anthologies, of, the, best, american, poets, be, made, available, in, hotels, and, airports, hospitals, and, supermarkets, he, thought, that, people, who, are, restless, or, fearful, or, lonely, or, weary, might, pick, up, poetry, and, discover, unexpectedly, that, others, had, experienced, these, emotions, before, and, had, used, them, to, celebrate, life, rather, than, escape, from, it, joseph, s, idea, was, picked, up, and, thousands, of, such, books, have, in, fact, been, placed, where, people, may, come, across, them, out, of, need, or, curiosity, this, passion, for, promoting, the, seriousness, and, importance, of, poetry, comes, through, in, brodsky, s, opening, remarks, as, the, u, s, poet, laureate, in, october, 1991, he, said, by, failing, to, read, or, listen, to, poets, society, dooms, itself, to, inferior, modes, of, articulation, those, of, the, politician, the, salesman, or, the, charlatan, in, other, words, it, forfeits, its, own, evolutionary, potential, for, what, distinguishes, us, from, the, rest, of, the, animal, kingdom, is, precisely, the, gift, of, speech, poetry, is, not, a, form, of, entertainment, and, in, a, certain, sense, not, even, a, form, of, art, but, it, is, our, anthropological, genetic, goal, our, evolutionary, linguistic, beacon, this, sentiment, is, echoed, throughout, his, work, in, interview, with, sven, birkerts, in, 1979,
