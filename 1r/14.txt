carl, laemmle, the, head, of, universal, studios, considered, terminating, davis, s, employment, but, cinematographer, karl, freund, told, him, she, had, lovely, eyes, and, would, be, suitable, for, bad, sister, 1931, in, which, she, subsequently, made, her, film, debut, her, nervousness, was, compounded, when, she, overheard, the, chief, of, production, carl, laemmle, jr, comment, to, another, executive, that, she, had, about, as, much, sex, appeal, as, slim, summerville, one, of, the, film, s, co, stars, the, film, was, not, a, success, and, her, next, role, in, seed, 1931, was, too,

preparing, to, return, to, new, york, when, actor, george, arliss, chose, davis, for, the, lead, female, role, in, the, warner, bros, picture, the, man, who, played, god, 1932, and, for, the, rest, of, her, life, davis, credited, him, with, helping, her, achieve, her, break, in, hollywood, the, saturday, evening, post, wrote, she, is, not, only, beautiful, but, she, bubbles, with, charm, and, compared, her, to, constance, bennett, and, olive, borden, warner, bros, signed, her, to, a, five, year, contract, and, she, remained, with, the, studio, for, the, next, 18, years, davis, s, first, marriage, was, to, harmon, oscar, nelson, on, august, 18, 1932, in, yuma, arizona, their, marriage, was, scrutinized, by, the, press, his, 100, a, week, earnings, 1, 885, in, 2020, dollars, compared, unfavorably, with, davis, s, reported, 1, 000, a, week, income, 18, 850, davis, addressed, the, issue, in, an, interview, pointing, out, that, many, hollywood, wives, earned, more, than, their, husbands, but, the, situation, proved, difficult, for, nelson, who, refused, to, allow, davis, to, purchase, a, house, until, he, could, afford, to, pay, for, it, himself, nelson, was, able, to, enforce, his, wishes, because, at, the, time, the, husband, had, the, management, and, control, of, the, community, property, which, included, the, wife, s, earnings, and, the, wife, could, not, obtain, credit, without, her, husband, s, consent, davis, had, several, abortions, during, the, marriage, after, more, than, 20, film, roles, she, had, her, critical, breakthrough, playing, the, role, of, the, vicious, and, slatternly, mildred, rogers, in, the, rko, radio, production, of, of, human, bondage, 1934, a, film, adaptation, of, w, somerset, maugham, s, novel, it, earned, davis, her, first, major, critical, acclaim, although, contentiously, she, was, not, among, the, three, nominees, for, the, academy, award, for, best, actress, that, year, many, actresses, feared, playing, unsympathetic, characters, and, several, had, refused, the, role, but, davis, viewed, it, as, an, opportunity, to, show, the, range, of, her, acting, skills, her, co, star, leslie, howard, was, initially, dismissive, of, her, but, as, filming, progressed, his, attitude, changed, and, he, subsequently, spoke, highly, of, her, abilities, the, director, john, cromwell, allowed, her, relative, freedom, i, let, bette, have, her, head, i, trusted, her, instincts, she, insisted, that, she, be, portrayed, realistically, in, her, death, scene, and, said, the, last, stages, of, consumption, poverty, and, neglect, are, not, pretty, and, i, intended, to, be, convincing, looking, the, film, was, a, success, and, davis, s, characterization, earned, praise, from, critics, with, life, writing, that, she, gave, probably, the, best, performance, ever, recorded, on, the, screen, by, a, u, s, actress, davis, anticipated, that, her, reception, would, encourage, warner, bros, to, cast, her, in, more, important, roles, and, was, disappointed, when, jack, l, warner, refused, to, lend, her, to, columbia, studios, to, appear, in, it, happened, one, night, and, instead, cast, her, in, the, melodrama, housewife, when, davis, was, not, nominated, for, an, academy, award, for, of, human, bondage, the, hollywood, citizen, news, questioned, the, omission, and, norma, shearer, herself, a, nominee, joined, a, campaign, to, have, davis, nominated, this, prompted, an, announcement, from, the, academy, president, howard, estabrook, who, said, that, under, the, circumstances, any, voter, may, write, on, the, ballot, his, or, her, personal, choice, for, the, winners, thus, allowing, for, the, only, time, in, the, academy, s, history, the, consideration, of, a, candidate, not, officially, nominated, for, an, award, the, uproar, led, however, to, a, change, in, academy, voting, procedures, the, following, year, wherein, nominations, were, determined, by, votes, from, all, eligible, members, of, a, particular, branch, rather, than, by, a, smaller, committee, with, results, independently, tabulated, by, the, accounting, firm, price, waterhouse, the, next, year, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, became, the, only, film, to, win, a, write, in, oscar, for, best, cinematography, the, next, year, her, performance, as, a, down, and, out, troubled, actress, in, dangerous, 1935, received, very, good, reviews, and, landed, davis, her, first, best, actress, nomination, and, win, e, arnot, robertson, wrote, in, picture, post, that, i, think, bette, davis, would, probably, have, been, burned, as, a, witch, if, she, had, lived, two, or, three, hundred, years, ago, she, gives, the, curious, feeling, of, being, charged, with, power, which, can, find, no, ordinary, outlet, the, new, york, times, hailed, her, as, becoming, one, of, the, most, interesting, of, our, screen, actresses, she, won, the, academy, award, for, best, actress, for, the, role, but, commented, that, it, was, belated, recognition, for, of, human, bondage, calling, the, award, a, consolation, prize, for, the, rest, of, her, life, davis, maintained, that, she, gave, the, statue, its, familiar, name, of, oscar, because, its, posterior, resembled, that, of, her, husband, whose, middle, name, was, oscar, although, the, academy, of, motion, picture, arts, and, sciences, officially, makes, reference, to, another, story, in, her, next, film, the, petrified, forest, 1936, davis, co, starred, with, leslie, howard, and, humphrey, bogart, in, the, spring, of, 1936, davis, asked, warner, bros, to, loan, her, out, to, rko, to, make, mary, of, scotland, warner, bros, refused, and, assigned, davis, to, two, films, that, were, written, specifically, for, her, god, s, country, and, the, woman, and, mountain, justice, however, as, god, s, country, and, the, woman, was, going, into, production, davis, refused, to, work, and, demanded, a, salary, increase, on, her, contract, with, warner, bros, at, the, time, davis, was, earning, 1, 250, per, week, jack, warner, offered, davis, an, increased, salary, of, 2, 250, per, week, which, davis, refused, davis, s, agent, mike, levee, said, she, s, a, very, stubborn, young, lady, i, asked, her, how, much, she, wanted, and, she, said, 3, 500, a, week, plus, all, radio, rights, and, permission, to, make, outside, pictures, i, told, her, whoa, that, s, too, much, meanwhile, due, to, davis, s, refusal, to, continue, with, god, s, county, and, the, woman, warner, bros, was, incurring, excessive, production, costs, because, the, film, was, being, made, in, technicolor, and, the, technicolor, cameras, were, on, loan, out, in, late, june, the, studio, put, davis, on, suspension, for, refusal, to, work, and, replaced, her, in, the, film, with, beverly, roberts, during, negotiations, with, warner, bros, regarding, her, salary, and, signing, davis, for, the, female, lead, in, danton, davis, abruptly, traveled, to, england, with, her, husband, harmon, nelson, on, a, vacation, however, in, england, davis, signed, a, contract, with, british, film, production, company, toplitz, to, make, the, film, i, ll, take, the, low, road, in, england, with, maurice, chevalier, for, a, 50, 000, salary, on, september, 9, 1936, warner, brothers, filed, a, legal, injunction, against, davis, in, england, which, forbade, her, from, appearing, in, film, productions, without, their, consent, while, on, a, shopping, spree, in, paris, davis, publicly, declared, to, the, press, that, she, intended, to, defy, warner, bros, legal, injunction, and, make, the, film, in, england, on, october, 14, 1936, the, british, court, held, a, hearing, regarding, the, studio, s, injunction, against, davis, mr, justice, branson, issued, his, decision, on, october, 19, ruling, in, favor, of, warner, bros, justice, branson, dismissed, davis, s, representative, s, claims, that, she, was, an, underpaid, slave, held, under, a, life, sentence, and, ruled, that, davis, was, in, breach, of, her, contract, to, warner, for, no, discoverable, reason, except, that, she, wanted, more, money, davis, was, ordered, to, pay, warner, bros, 80, 000, in, restitution, and, was, also, ordered, to, pay, the, studio, s, legal, fees, for, filing, the, injunction, in, england, the, british, press, offered, little, support, to, davis, calling, her, overpaid, and, ungrateful, in, 1943, actress, olivia, de, havilland, won, a, lawsuit, against, warner, bros, regarding, the, length, of, time, a, studio, contract, could, be, legally, enforceable, which, is, seven, years, in, her, later, years, davis, would, falsely, claim, in, interviews, that, she, set, the, path, for, de, havilland, s, legal, victory, however, this, is, grossly, inaccurate, warners, 1936, injunction, against, davis, was, due, to, her, attempt, to, unlawfully, breach, her, contract, to, work, for, another, production, company, because, she, and, warners, were, having, a, salary, disagreement, and, bears, no, resemblance, to, the, de, havilland, legal, case, the, same, year, she, starred, with, humphrey, bogart, in, marked, woman, 1937, a, contemporary, gangster, drama, inspired, by, the, case, of, lucky, luciano, a, film, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, in, her, early, career, she, was, awarded, the, volpi, cup, at, the,

later, described, him, as, the, love, of, my, life, and, said, that, making, the, film, with, him, was, the, time, in, my, life, of, my, most, perfect, happiness, the, film, was, a, success, and, davis, s, performance, as, a, spoiled, southern, belle, earned, her, a, second, academy, award, this, led, to, speculation, in, the, press, that, she, would, be, chosen, to, play, scarlett, o, hara, a, similar, character, in, gone, with, the, wind, davis, expressed, her, desire, to, play, scarlett, and, while, david, o, selznick, was, conducting, a, search, for, the, actress, to, play, the, role, a, radio, poll, named, her, as, the, audience, favorite, warner, offered, her, services, to, selznick, as, part, of, a, deal, that, also, included, errol, flynn, and, olivia, de, havilland, but,

s, career, and, over, the, next, few, years, she, was, listed, in, the, annual, quigley, poll, of, the, top, ten, money, making, stars, which, was, compiled, from, the, votes, of, movie, exhibitors, throughout, the, u, s, for, the, stars, who, had, generated, the, most, revenue, in, their, theaters, over, the, previous, year, in, contrast, to, davis, s, success, her, husband, ham, nelson, had, failed, to, establish, a, career, for, himself, and, their, relationship, faltered, in, 1938, nelson, obtained, evidence, that, davis, was, engaged, in, a, sexual, relationship, with, howard, hughes, and, subsequently, filed, for, divorce, citing, davis, s, cruel, and, inhuman, manner, davis, was, emotional, during, the, making, of, her, next, film, dark, victory, 1939, and, considered, abandoning, it, until, the, producer, hal, b, wallis, convinced, her, to, channel, her, despair, into, her, acting, the, film, was, among, the, high, grossing, films, of, the, year, and, the, role, of, judith, traherne, a, spirited, heiress, suffering, from, a, malignant, brain, tumor, brought, her, an, academy, award, nomination, in, later, years, davis, cited, this, performance, as, her,

laughton, she, commented, that, she, had, a, nerve, playing, a, woman, in, her, 60s, to, which, laughton, replied, never, not, dare, to, hang, yourself, that, s, the, only, way, you, grow, in, your, profession, you, must, continually, attempt, things, that, you, think, are, beyond, you, or, you, get, into, a, complete, rut, recalling, the, episode, many, years, later, davis, remarked, that, laughton, s, advice, had, influenced, her, throughout, her, career, by, this, time, davis, was, warner, bros, most, profitable, star, and, she, was, given, the, most, important, of, their, female, leading, roles, her, image, was, considered, with, more, care, although, she, continued, to, play, character, roles, she, was, often, filmed, in, close, ups, that, emphasized, her, distinctive, eyes, all, this, and, heaven, too, 1940, was, the, most, financially, successful, film, of, davis, s, career, to, that, point, the, letter, 1940, was, considered, one, of, the, best, pictures, of, the, year, by, the, hollywood, reporter, and, davis, won, admiration, for, her, portrayal, of, an, adulterous, killer, a, role, originated, onstage, by, katharine, cornell, during, this, time, she, was, in, a, relationship, with, her, former, co, star, george, brent, who, proposed, marriage, davis, refused, as, she, had, met, arthur, farnsworth, a, new, england, innkeeper, and, vermont, dentist, s,

figurehead, only, faced, with, the, disapproval, and, resistance, of, the, committee, davis, resigned, and, was, succeeded, by, her, predecessor, walter, wanger, davis, starred, in, three, movies, in,
