barbara, mcclintock, june, 16, 1902, september, 2, 1992, was, an, american, scientist, and, cytogeneticist, who, was, awarded, the, 1983, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, mcclintock, received, her, phd, in, botany, from, cornell, university, in, 1927, there, she, started, her, career, as, the, leader, of, the, development, of, maize, cytogenetics, the, focus, of, her, research, for, the, rest, of, her, life, from, the, late, 1920s, mcclintock, studied, chromosomes, and, how, they, change, during, reproduction, in, maize, she, developed, the, technique, for, visualizing, maize, chromosomes, and, used, microscopic, analysis, to, demonstrate, many, fundamental, genetic, ideas, one, of, those, ideas, was, the, notion, of, genetic, recombination, by, crossing, over, during, meiosis, a, mechanism, by, which, chromosomes, exchange, information, she, produced, the, first, genetic, map, for, maize, linking, regions, of, the, chromosome, to, physical, traits, she, demonstrated, the, role, of, the, telomere, and, centromere, regions, of, the, chromosome, that, are, important, in, the, conservation, of, genetic, information, she, was, recognized, as, among, the, best, in, the, field, awarded, prestigious, fellowships, and, elected, a, member, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1944, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, mcclintock, discovered, transposons, and, used, it, to, demonstrate, that, genes, are, responsible, for, turning, physical, characteristics, on, and, off, she, developed, theories, to, explain, the, suppression, and, expression, of, genetic, information, from, one, generation, of, maize, plants, to, the, next, due, to, skepticism, of, her, research, and, its, implications, she, stopped, publishing, her, data, in, 1953, later, she, made, an, extensive, study, of, the, cytogenetics, and, ethnobotany, of, maize, races, from, south, america, mcclintock, s, research, became, well, understood, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, other, scientists, confirmed, the, mechanisms, of, genetic, change, and, protein, expression, that, she, had, demonstrated, in, her, maize, research, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, awards, and, recognition, for, her, contributions, to, the, field, followed, including, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, awarded, to, her, in, 1983, for, the, discovery, of, genetic, transposition, as, of, 2023, she, remains, the, only, woman, who, has, received, an, unshared, nobel, prize, in, that, category, barbara, mcclintock, was, born, eleanor, mcclintock, on, june, 16, 1902, in, hartford, connecticut, the, third, of, four, children, born, to, homeopathic, physician, thomas, henry, mcclintock, and, sara, handy, mcclintock, thomas, mcclintock, was, the, child, of, british, immigrants, marjorie, the, oldest, child, was, born, in, october, 1898, mignon, the, second, daughter, was, born, in, november, 1900, the, youngest, malcolm, rider, called, tom, was, born, 18, months, after, barbara, when, she, was, a, young, girl, her, parents, determined, that, eleanor, a, feminine, and, delicate, name, was, not, appropriate, for, her, and, chose, barbara, instead, mcclintock, was, an, independent, child, beginning, at, a, very, young, age, a, trait, she, later, identified, as, her, capacity, to, be, alone, from, the, age, of, three, until, she, began, school, mcclintock, lived, with, an, aunt, and, uncle, in, brooklyn, new, york, in, order, to, reduce, the, financial, burden, on, her, parents, while, her, father, established, his, medical, practice, she, was, described, as, a, solitary, and, independent, child, she, was, close, to, her, father, but, had, a, difficult, relationship, with, her, mother, tension, that, began, when, she, was, young, the, mcclintock, family, moved, to, brooklyn, in, 1908, and, mcclintock, completed, her, secondary, education, there, at, erasmus, hall, high, school, she, graduated, early, in, 1919, she, discovered, her, love, of, science, and, reaffirmed, her, solitary, personality, during, high, school, she, wanted, to, continue, her, studies, at, cornell, university, s, college, of, agriculture, her, mother, resisted, sending, mcclintock, to, college, for, fear, that, she, would, be, unmarriageable, a, common, attitude, at, the, time, mcclintock, was, almost, prevented, from, starting, college, but, her, father, allowed, her, to, just, before, registration, began, and, she, matriculated, at, cornell, in, 1919, mcclintock, began, her, studies, at, cornell, s, college, of, agriculture, in, 1919, there, she, participated, in, student, government, and, was, invited, to, join, a, sorority, though, she, soon, realized, that, she, preferred, not, to, join, formal, organizations, instead, mcclintock, took, up, music, specifically, jazz, she, studied, botany, receiving, a, bsc, in, 1923, her, interest, in, genetics, began, when, she, took, her, first, course, in, that, field, in, 1921, the, course, was, based, on, a, similar, one, offered, at, harvard, university, and, was, taught, by, c, b, hutchison, a, plant, breeder, and, geneticist, hutchison, was, impressed, by, mcclintock, s, interest, and, telephoned, to, invite, her, to, participate, in, the, graduate, genetics, course, at, cornell, in, 1922, mcclintock, pointed, to, hutchison, s, invitation, as, a, catalyst, for, her, interest, in, genetics, obviously, this, telephone, call, cast, the, die, for, my, future, i, remained, with, genetics, thereafter, although, it, has, been, reported, that, women, could, not, major, in, genetics, at, cornell, and, therefore, her, ms, and, phd, earned, in, 1925, and, 1927, respectively, were, officially, awarded, in, botany, recent, research, has, revealed, that, women, were, permitted, to, earn, graduate, degrees, in, cornell, s, plant, breeding, department, during, the, time, that, mcclintock, was, a, student, at, cornell, during, her, graduate, studies, and, postgraduate, appointment, as, a, botany, instructor, mcclintock, was, instrumental, in, assembling, a, group, that, studied, the, new, field, of, cytogenetics, in, maize, this, group, brought, together, plant, breeders, and, cytologists, and, included, marcus, rhoades, future, nobel, laureate, george, beadle, and, harriet, creighton, rollins, a, emerson, head, of, the, plant, breeding, department, supported, these, efforts, although, he, was, not, a, cytologist, himself, she, also, worked, as, a, research, assistant, for, lowell, fitz, randolph, and, then, for, lester, w, sharp, both, cornell, botanists, mcclintock, s, cytogenetic, research, focused, on, developing, ways, to, visualize, and, characterize, maize, chromosomes, this, particular, part, of, her, work, influenced, a, generation, of, students, as, it, was, included, in, most, textbooks, she, also, developed, a, technique, using, carmine, staining, to, visualize, maize, chromosomes, and, showed, for, the, first, time, the, morphology, of, the, 10, maize, chromosomes, this, discovery, was, made, because, she, observed, cells, from, the, microspore, as, opposed, to, the, root, tip, by, studying, the, morphology, of, the, chromosomes, mcclintock, was, able, to, link, specific, chromosome, groups, of, traits, that, were, inherited, together, marcus, rhoades, noted, that, mcclintock, s, 1929, genetics, paper, on, the, characterization, of, triploid, maize, chromosomes, triggered, scientific, interest, in, maize, cytogenetics, and, attributed, to, her, 10, of, the, 17, significant, advances, in, the, field, that, were, made, by, cornell, scientists, between, 1929, and, 1935, in, 1930, mcclintock, was, the, first, person, to, describe, the, cross, shaped, interaction, of, homologous, chromosomes, during, meiosis, the, following, year, mcclintock, and, creighton, proved, the, link, between, chromosomal, crossover, during, meiosis, and, the, recombination, of, genetic, traits, they, observed, how, the, recombination, of, chromosomes, seen, under, a, microscope, correlated, with, new, traits, until, this, point, it, had, only, been, hypothesized, that, genetic, recombination, could, occur, during, meiosis, although, it, had, not, been, shown, genetically, mcclintock, published, the, first, genetic, map, for, maize, in, 1931, showing, the, order, of, three, genes, on, maize, chromosome, 9, this, information, provided, necessary, data, for, the, crossing, over, study, she, published, with, creighton, they, also, showed, that, crossing, over, occurs, in, sister, chromatids, as, well, as, homologous, chromosomes, in, 1938, she, produced, a, cytogenetic, analysis, of, the, centromere, describing, the, organization, and, function, of, the, centromere, as, well, as, the, fact, that, it, can, divide, mcclintock, s, breakthrough, publications, and, support, from, her, colleagues, led, to, her, being, awarded, several, postdoctoral, fellowships, from, the, national, research, council, this, funding, allowed, her, to, continue, to, study, genetics, at, cornell, the, university, of, missouri, and, the, california, institute, of, technology, where, she, worked, with, e, g, anderson, during, the, summers, of, 1931, and, 1932, she, worked, at, the, university, of, missouri, with, geneticist, lewis, stadler, who, introduced, her, to, the, use, of, x, rays, as, a, mutagen, exposure, to, x, rays, can, increase, the, rate, of, mutation, above, the, natural, background, level, making, it, a, powerful, research, tool, for, genetics, through, her, work, with, x, ray, mutagenized, maize, she, identified, ring, chromosomes, which, form, when, the, ends, of, a, single, chromosome, fuse, together, after, radiation, damage, from, this, evidence, mcclintock, hypothesized, that, there, must, be, a, structure, on, the, chromosome, tip, that, would, normally, ensure, stability, she, showed, that, the, loss, of, ring, chromosomes, at, meiosis, caused, variegation, in, maize, foliage, in, generations, subsequent, to, irradiation, resulting, from, chromosomal, deletion, during, this, period, she, demonstrated, the, presence, of, the, nucleolus, organizer, region, on, a, region, on, maize, chromosome, 6, which, is, required, for, the, assembly, of, the, nucleolus, in, 1933, she, established, that, cells, can, be, damaged, when, nonhomologous, recombination, occurs, during, this, same, period, mcclintock, hypothesized, that, the, tips, of, chromosomes, are, protected, by, telomeres, mcclintock, received, a, fellowship, from, the, guggenheim, foundation, that, made, possible, six, months, of, training, in, germany, during, 1933, and, 1934, she, had, planned, to, work, with, curt, stern, who, had, demonstrated, crossing, over, in, drosophila, just, weeks, after, mcclintock, and, creighton, had, done, so, however, stern, emigrated, to, the, united, states, instead, she, worked, with, geneticist, richard, b, goldschmidt, who, was, a, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, biology, in, berlin, she, left, germany, early, amidst, mounting, political, tension, in, europe, returned, to, cornell, but, found, that, the, university, would, not, hire, a, woman, professor, in, 1936, she, accepted, an, assistant, professorship, offered, to, her, by, lewis, stadler, in, the, department, of, botany, at, the, university, of, missouri, in, columbia, while, still, at, cornell, she, was, supported, by, a, two, year, rockefeller, foundation, grant, obtained, for, her, through, emerson, s, efforts, during, her, time, at, missouri, mcclintock, expanded, her, research, on, the, effect, of, x, rays, on, maize, cytogenetics, mcclintock, observed, the, breakage, and, fusion, of, chromosomes, in, irradiated, maize, cells, she, was, also, able, to, show, that, in, some, plants, spontaneous, chromosome, breakage, occurred, in, the, cells, of, the, endosperm, over, the, course, of, mitosis, she, observed, that, the, ends, of, broken, chromatids, were, rejoined, after, the, chromosome, replication, in, the, anaphase, of, mitosis, the, broken, chromosomes, formed, a, chromatid, bridge, which, was, broken, when, the, chromatids, moved, towards, the, cell, poles, the, broken, ends, were, rejoined, in, the, interphase, of, the, next, mitosis, and, the, cycle, was, repeated, causing, massive, mutation, which, she, could, detect, as, variegation, in, the, endosperm, this, breakage, rejoining, bridge, cycle, was, a, key, cytogenetic, discovery, for, several, reasons, first, it, showed, that, the, rejoining, of, chromosomes, was, not, a, random, event, and, second, it, demonstrated, a, source, of, large, scale, mutation, for, this, reason, it, remains, an, area, of, interest, in, cancer, research, today, although, her, research, was, progressing, at, missouri, mcclintock, was, not, satisfied, with, her, position, at, the, university, she, recalled, being, excluded, from, faculty, meetings, and, was, not, made, aware, of, positions, available, at, other, institutions, in, 1940, she, wrote, to, charles, burnham, i, have, decided, that, i, must, look, for, another, job, as, far, as, i, can, make, out, there, is, nothing, more, for, me, here, i, am, an, assistant, professor, at, 3, 000, and, i, feel, sure, that, that, is, the, limit, for, me, initially, mcclintock, s, position, was, created, especially, for, her, by, stadler, and, might, have, depended, on, his, presence, at, the, university, mcclintock, believed, she, would, not, gain, tenure, at, missouri, even, though, according, to, some, accounts, she, knew, she, would, be, offered, a, promotion, from, missouri, in, the, spring, of, 1942, recent, evidence, reveals, that, mcclintock, more, likely, decided, to, leave, missouri, because, she, had, lost, trust, in, her, employer, and, in, the, university, administration, after, discovering, that, her, job, would, be, in, jeopardy, if, stadler, were, to, leave, for, caltech, as, he, had, considered, doing, the, university, s, retaliation, against, stadler, amplified, her, sentiments, in, early, 1941, she, took, a, leave, of, absence, from, missouri, in, hopes, of, finding, a, position, elsewhere, she, accepted, a, visiting, professorship, at, columbia, university, where, her, former, cornell, colleague, marcus, rhoades, was, a, professor, rhoades, also, offered, to, share, his, research, field, at, cold, spring, harbor, on, long, island, in, december, 1941, she, was, offered, a, research, position, by, milislav, demerec, the, newly, appointed, acting, director, of, the, carnegie, institution, of, washington, s, department, of, genetics, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, mcclintock, accepted, his, invitation, despite, her, qualms, and, became, a, permanent, member, of, the, faculty, after, her, year, long, temporary, appointment, mcclintock, accepted, a, full, time, research, position, at, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, there, she, was, highly, productive, and, continued, her, work, with, the, breakage, fusion, bridge, cycle, using, it, to, substitute, for, x, rays, as, a, tool, for, mapping, new, genes, in, 1944, in, recognition, of, her, prominence, in, the, field, of, genetics, during, this, period, mcclintock, was, elected, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, only, the, third, woman, to, be, elected, the, following, year, she, became, the, first, female, president, of, the, genetics, society, of, america, she, had, been, elected, its, vice, president, in, 1939, in, 1944, she, undertook, a, cytogenetic, analysis, of, neurospora, crassa, at, the, suggestion, of, george, beadle, who, used, the, fungus, to, demonstrate, the, one, gene, one, enzyme, relationship, he, invited, her, to, stanford, to, undertake, the, study, she, successfully, described, the, number, of, chromosomes, or, karyotype, of, n, crassa, and, described, the, entire, life, cycle, of, the, species, beadle, said, barbara, in, two, months, at, stanford, did, more, to, clean, up, the, cytology, of, neurospora, than, all, other, cytological, geneticists, had, done, in, all, previous, time, on, all, forms, of, mold, n, crassa, has, since, become, a, model, species, for, classical, genetic, analysis, in, the, summer, of, 1944, at, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, mcclintock, began, systematic, studies, on, the, mechanisms, of, the, mosaic, color, patterns, of, maize, seed, and, the, unstable, inheritance, of, this, mosaicism, she, identified, two, new, dominant, and, interacting, genetic, loci, that, she, named, dissociation, ds, and, activator, ac, she, found, that, the, dissociation, did, not, just, dissociate, or, cause, the, chromosome, to, break, it, also, had, a, variety, of, effects, on, neighboring, genes, when, the, activator, was, also, present, which, included, making, certain, stable, mutations, unstable, in, early, 1948, she, made, the, surprising, discovery, that, both, dissociation, and, activator, could, transpose, or, change, position, on, the, chromosome, she, observed, the, effects, of, the, transposition, of, ac, and, ds, by, the, changing, patterns, of, coloration, in, maize, kernels, over, generations, of, controlled, crosses, and, described, the, relationship, between, the, two, loci, through, intricate, microscopic, analysis, she, concluded, that, ac, controls, the, transposition, of, the, ds, from, chromosome, 9, and, that, the, movement, of, ds, is, accompanied, by, the, breakage, of, the, chromosome, when, ds, moves, the, aleurone, color, gene, is, released, from, the, suppressing, effect, of, the, ds, and, transformed, into, the, active, form, which, initiates, the, pigment, synthesis, in, cells, the, transposition, of, ds, in, different, cells, is, random, it, may, move, in, some, but, not, others, which, causes, color, mosaicism, the, size, of, the, colored, spot, on, the, seed, is, determined, by, stage, of, the, seed, development, during, dissociation, mcclintock, also, found, that, the, transposition, of, ds, is, determined, by, the, number, of, ac, copies, in, the, cell, between, 1948, and, 1950, she, developed, a, theory, by, which, these, mobile, elements, regulated, the, genes, by, inhibiting, or, modulating, their, action, she, referred, to, dissociation, and, activator, as, controlling, units, later, as, controlling, elements, to, distinguish, them, from, genes, she, hypothesized, that, gene, regulation, could, explain, how, complex, multicellular, organisms, made, of, cells, with, identical, genomes, have, cells, of, different, function, mcclintock, s, discovery, challenged, the, concept, of, the, genome, as, a, static, set, of, instructions, passed, between, generations, in, 1950, she, reported, her, work, on, ac, ds, and, her, ideas, about, gene, regulation, in, a, paper, entitled, the, origin, and, behavior, of, mutable, loci, in, maize, published, in, the, journal, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, summer, 1951, she, reported, her, work, on, the, origin, and, behavior, of, mutable, loci, in, maize, at, the, annual, symposium, at, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, presenting, a, paper, of, the, same, name, the, paper, delved, into, the, instability, caused, by, ds, and, ac, or, just, ac, in, four, genes, along, with, the, tendency, of, those, genes, to, unpredictably, revert, to, the, wild, phenotype, she, also, identified, families, of, transposons, which, did, not, interact, with, one, another, her, work, on, controlling, elements, and, gene, regulation, was, conceptually, difficult, and, was, not, immediately, understood, or, accepted, by, her, contemporaries, she, described, the, reception, of, her, research, as, puzzlement, even, hostility, nevertheless, mcclintock, continued, to, develop, her, ideas, on, controlling, elements, she, published, a, paper, in, genetics, in, 1953, where, she, presented, all, her, statistical, data, and, undertook, lecture, tours, to, universities, throughout, the, 1950s, to, speak, about, her, work, she, continued, to, investigate, the, problem, and, identified, a, new, element, that, she, called, suppressor, mutator, spm, which, although, similar, to, ac, ds, acts, in, a, more, complex, manner, like, ac, ds, some, versions, could, transpose, on, their, own, and, some, could, not, unlike, ac, ds, when, present, it, fully, suppressed, the, expression, of, mutant, genes, when, they, normally, would, not, be, entirely, suppressed, based, on, the, reactions, of, other, scientists, to, her, work, mcclintock, felt, she, risked, alienating, the, scientific, mainstream, and, from, 1953, was, forced, to, stop, publishing, accounts, of, her, research, on, controlling, elements, in, 1957, mcclintock, received, funding, from, the, national, academy, of, sciences, to, start, research, on, indigenous, strains, of, maize, in, central, america, and, south, america, she, was, interested, in, studying, the, evolution, of, maize, through, chromosomal, changes, and, being, in, south, america, would, allow, her, to, work, on, a, larger, scale, mcclintock, explored, the, chromosomal, morphological, and, evolutionary, characteristics, of, various, races, of, maize, after, extensive, work, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, mcclintock, and, her, collaborators, published, the, seminal, study, the, chromosomal, constitution, of, races, of, maize, leaving, their, mark, on, paleobotany, ethnobotany, and, evolutionary, biology, mcclintock, officially, retired, from, her, position, at, the, carnegie, institution, in, 1967, and, was, made, a, distinguished, service, member, of, the, carnegie, institution, of, washington, this, honor, allowed, her, to, continue, working, with, graduate, students, and, colleagues, in, the, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, as, scientist, emerita, she, lived, in, the, town, in, reference, to, her, decision, 20, years, earlier, to, stop, publishing, detailed, accounts, of, her, work, on, controlling, elements, she, wrote, in, 1973, over, the, years, i, have, found, that, it, is, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, bring, to, consciousness, of, another, person, the, nature, of, his, tacit, assumptions, when, by, some, special, experiences, i, have, been, made, aware, of, them, this, became, painfully, evident, to, me, in, my, attempts, during, the, 1950s, to, convince, geneticists, that, the, action, of, genes, had, to, be, and, was, controlled, it, is, now, equally, painful, to, recognize, the, fixity, of, assumptions, that, many, persons, hold, on, the, nature, of, controlling, elements, in, maize, and, the, manners, of, their, operation, one, must, await, the, right, time, for, conceptual, change, the, importance, of, mcclintock, s, contributions, was, revealed, in, the, 1960s, when, the, work, of, french, geneticists, fran, ois, jacob, and, jacques, monod, described, the, genetic, regulation, of, the, lac, operon, a, concept, she, had, demonstrated, with, ac, ds, in, 1951, following, jacob, and, monod, s, 1961, journal, of, molecular, biology, paper, genetic, regulatory, mechanisms, in, the, synthesis, of, proteins, mcclintock, wrote, an, article, for, american, naturalist, comparing, the, lac, operon, and, her, work, on, controlling, elements, in, maize, even, late, in, the, twentieth, century, mcclintock, s, contribution, to, biology, was, still, not, widely, acknowledged, as, amounting, to, the, discovery, of, genetic, regulation, mcclintock, was, widely, credited, with, discovering, transposition, after, other, researchers, finally, discovered, the, process, in, bacteria, yeast, and, bacteriophages, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, during, this, period, molecular, biology, had, developed, significant, new, technology, and, scientists, were, able, to, show, the, molecular, basis, for, transposition, in, the, 1970s, ac, and, ds, were, cloned, by, other, scientists, and, were, shown, to, be, class, ii, transposons, ac, is, a, complete, transposon, that, can, produce, a, functional, transposase, which, is, required, for, the, element, to, move, within, the, genome, ds, has, a, mutation, in, its, transposase, gene, which, means, that, it, cannot, move, without, another, source, of, transposase, thus, as, mcclintock, observed, ds, cannot, move, in, the, absence, of, ac, spm, has, also, been, characterized, as, a, transposon, subsequent, research, has, shown, that, transposons, typically, do, not, move, unless, the, cell, is, placed, under, stress, such, as, by, irradiation, or, the, breakage, fusion, bridge, cycle, and, thus, their, activation, during, stress, can, serve, as, a, source, of, genetic, variation, for, evolution, mcclintock, understood, the, role, of, transposons, in, evolution, and, genome, change, well, before, other, researchers, grasped, the, concept, nowadays, ac, ds, is, used, as, a, tool, in, plant, biology, to, generate, mutant, plants, used, for, the, characterization, of, gene, function, in, 1947, mcclintock, received, the, achievement, award, from, the, american, association, of, university, women, she, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1959, in, 1967, mcclintock, was, awarded, the, kimber, genetics, award, three, years, later, she, was, given, the, national, medal, of, science, by, richard, nixon, in, 1970, she, was, the, first, woman, to, be, awarded, the, national, medal, of, science, cold, spring, harbor, named, a, building, in,

argued, that, because, mcclintock, felt, like, an, outsider, within, her, field, in, part, because, of, her, sex, she, was, able, to, look, at, her, scientific, subjects, from, a, perspective, different, from, the, dominant, one, leading, to, several, important, insights, keller, shows, how, this, led, many, of, her, colleagues, to, reject, her, ideas, and, undermine, her, abilities, for, many, years, for, example, when, mcclintock, presented, her, findings, that, the, genetics, of, maize, did, not, conform, to, mendelian, distributions, geneticist, sewall, wright, expressed, the, belief, that, she, did, not, understand, the, underlying, mathematics, of, her, work, a, belief, he, had, also, expressed, towards, other, women, at, the, time, in, addition, geneticist, lotte,

genetic, control, challenged, this, narrative, comfort, s, biography, contests, the, claim, that, mcclintock, was, marginalized, by, other, scientists, which, he, calls, the, mcclintock, myth, and, argues, was, perpetuated, both, by, mcclintock, herself, as, well, as, in, the, earlier, biography, by, keller, comfort, however, asserts, that, mcclintock, was, not, discriminated, against, because, of, her, gender, citing, that, she, was, well, regarded, by, her, professional, peers, even, in, the, early, years, of, her, career, many, recent, biographical, works, on, women, in, science, feature,
