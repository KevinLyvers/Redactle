the, later, years, of, silla, after, the, destruction, of, balhae, by, the, khitans, in, 926, balhae, s, last, crown, prince, and, much, of, its, ruling, class, sought, refuge, in, goryeo, where,

descendants, he, stated, that, the, khitans, are, no, different, from, beasts, and, should, be, guarded, against, the, unification, of, the, later, three, kingdoms, in, 936, was, very, important, in, korean, history, the, unification, of, 668, ce, by, silla, was, only, a, unification, of, approximately, half, of, the, peoples, of, the, korean, peninsula, and, its, vicinity, who, at, the, time, largely, considered, themselves, one, people, divided, among, many, states, since, the, northern, part, was, ruled, by, balhae, which, asserted, itself, as, a, reincarnation, of, goguryeo, however, wang, k, n, s, unification, in, 936, was, a, more, complete, unification, in, which, only, a, single, state, emerged, among, the, people, as, opposed, to, the, 7th, century, when, two, unified, silla, and, balhae, emerged, the, people, of, the, korean, peninsula, thereafter, remained, under, a, single, unified, state, until, 1948, when, korea, was, divided, into, north, and, south, by, soviets, and, u, s, forces, the, modern, name, of, korea, is, derived, from, the, name, goryeo, which, itself, is, derived, from, goguryeo, to, whose, heritage, and, by, extension, territory, wang, k, n, and, his, new, kingdom, laid, claim, as, the, first, ruler, to, more, fully, unite, the, people, of, the, korean, peninsula, under, a, single, state, many, modern, day, koreans, look, to, his, example, for, applicability, to, the, current, state, of, division, on, the, korean, peninsula, during, the, early, goryeo, dynasty, the, title, of, taeja, hanja, was, only, a, peerage, title, for, sons, of, the, king, a, separate, title, existed, for, the, heir, apparent, called, the, jeongyun, hanja
