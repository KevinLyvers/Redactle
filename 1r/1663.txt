edmond, or, edmund, halley, frs, h, l, i, 8, november, 1656, 25, january, 1742, was, an, english, astronomer, mathematician, and, physicist, he, was, the, second, astronomer, royal, in, britain, succeeding, john, flamsteed, in, 1720, from, an, observatory, he, constructed, on, saint, helena, in, 1676, 77, halley, catalogued, the, southern, celestial, hemisphere, and, recorded, a, transit, of, mercury, across, the, sun, he, realised, that, a, similar, transit, of, venus, could, be, used, to, determine, the, distances, between, earth, venus, and, the, sun, upon, his, return, to, england, he, was, made, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, and, with, the, help, of, king, charles, ii, was, granted, a, master, s, degree, from, oxford, halley, encouraged, and, helped, fund, the, publication, of, isaac, newton, s, influential, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, 1687, from, observations, halley, made, in, september, 1682, he, used, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, to, compute, the, periodicity, of, halley, s, comet, in, his, 1705, synopsis, of, the, astronomy, of, comets, it, was, named, after, him, upon, its, predicted, return, in, 1758, which, he, did, not, live, to, see, beginning, in, 1698, halley, made, sailing, expeditions, and, made, observations, on, the, conditions, of, terrestrial, magnetism, in, 1718, he, discovered, the, proper, motion, of, the, fixed, stars, halley, was, born, in, haggerston, in, middlesex, his, father, edmond, halley, sr, came, from, a, derbyshire, family, and, was, a, wealthy, soap, maker, in, london, as, a, child, halley, was, very, interested, in, mathematics, he, studied, at, st, paul, s, school, where, he, developed, his, initial, interest, in, astronomy, and, was, elected, captain, of, the, school, in, 1671, the, following, year, halley, s, mother, anne, probably, n, e, robinson, died, in, july, 1673, he, began, studying, at, the, queen, s, college, oxford, halley, took, a, twenty, four, foot, 7, 3, m, long, telescope, with, him, apparently, paid, for, by, his, father, while, still, an, undergraduate, halley, published, papers, on, the, solar, system, and, sunspots, in, march, 1675, he, wrote, to, john, flamsteed, the, astronomer, royal, england, s, first, telling, him, that, the, leading, published, tables, on, the, positions, of, jupiter, and, saturn, were, erroneous, as, were, some, of, tycho, brahe, s, star, positions, in, 1676, flamsteed, helped, halley, publish, his, first, paper, titled, a, direct, and, geometrical, method, of, finding, the, aphelia, eccentricities, and, proportions, of, the, primary, planets, without, supposing, equality, in, angular, motion, about, planetary, orbits, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, influenced, by, flamsteed, s, project, to, compile, a, catalogue, of, stars, of, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, halley, proposed, to, do, the, same, for, the, southern, sky, dropping, out, of, school, to, do, so, he, chose, the, south, atlantic, island, of, saint, helena, west, of, africa, from, which, he, would, be, able, to, observe, not, only, the, southern, stars, but, also, some, of, the, northern, stars, with, which, to, cross, reference, them, king, charles, ii, supported, his, endeavour, halley, sailed, to, the, island, in, late, 1676, then, set, up, an, observatory, with, a, large, sextant, with, telescopic, sights, over, a, year, he, made, observations, with, which, he, would, produce, the, first, telescopic, catalogue, of, the, southern, sky, and, observed, a, transit, of, mercury, across, the, sun, focusing, on, this, latter, observation, halley, realised, that, observing, the, solar, parallax, of, a, planet, more, ideally, using, the, transit, of, venus, which, would, not, occur, within, his, lifetime, could, be, used, to, trigonometrically, determine, the, distances, between, earth, venus, and, the, sun, halley, returned, to, england, in, may, 1678, and, used, his, data, to, produce, a, map, of, the, southern, stars, oxford, would, not, allow, halley, to, return, because, he, had, violated, his, residency, requirements, when, he, left, for, saint, helena, he, appealed, to, charles, ii, who, signed, a, letter, requesting, that, halley, be, unconditionally, awarded, his, master, of, arts, degree, which, the, college, granted, on, 3, december, 1678, just, a, few, days, before, halley, had, been, elected, as, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, at, the, age, of, 22, in, 1679, he, published, catalogus, stellarum, australium, a, catalogue, of, the, stars, of, the, south, which, includes, his, map, and, descriptions, of, 341, stars, robert, hooke, presented, the, catalogue, to, the, royal, society, in, mid, 1679, halley, went, to, danzig, gda, sk, on, behalf, of, the, society, to, help, resolve, a, dispute, because, astronomer, johannes, hevelius, observing, instruments, were, not, equipped, with, telescopic, sights, flamsteed, and, hooke, had, questioned, the, accuracy, of, his, observations, halley, stayed, with, hevelius, and, checked, his, observations, finding, that, they, were, quite, precise, by, 1681, giovanni, domenico, cassini, had, told, halley, of, his, theory, that, comets, were, objects, in, orbit, in, september, 1682, halley, carried, out, a, series, of, observations, of, what, became, known, as, halley, s, comet, his, name, became, associated, with, it, because, of, his, work, on, its, orbit, and, predicting, its, return, in, 1758, which, he, did, not, live, to, see, in, early, 1686, halley, was, elected, to, the, royal, society, s, new, position, of, secretary, requiring, him, to, give, up, his, fellowship, and, manage, correspondence, and, meetings, as, well, as, edit, the, philosophical, transactions, also, in, 1686, halley, published, the, second, part, of, the, results, from, his, helenian, expedition, being, a, paper, and, chart, on, trade, winds, and, monsoons, the, symbols, he, used, to, represent, trailing, winds, still, exist, in, most, modern, day, weather, chart, representations, in, this, article, he, identified, solar, heating, as, the, cause, of, atmospheric, motions, he, also, established, the, relationship, between, barometric, pressure, and, height, above, sea, level, his, charts, were, an, important, contribution, to, the, emerging, field, of, information, visualisation, halley, spent, most, of, his, time, on, lunar, observations, but, was, also, interested, in, the, problems, of, gravity, one, problem, that, attracted, his, attention, was, the, proof, of, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, in, august, 1684, he, went, to, cambridge, to, discuss, this, with, isaac, newton, much, as, john, flamsteed, had, done, four, years, earlier, only, to, find, that, newton, had, solved, the, problem, at, the, instigation, of, flamsteed, with, regard, to, the, orbit, of, comet, kirch, without, publishing, the, solution, halley, asked, to, see, the, calculations, and, was, told, by, newton, that, he, could, not, find, them, but, promised, to, redo, them, and, send, them, on, later, which, he, eventually, did, in, a, short, treatise, titled, on, the, motion, of, bodies, in, an, orbit, halley, recognised, the, importance, of, the, work, and, returned, to, cambridge, to, arrange, its, publication, with, newton, who, instead, went, on, to, expand, it, into, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, published, at, halley, s, expense, in, 1687, halley, s, first, calculations, with, comets, were, thereby, for, the, orbit, of, comet, kirch, based, on, flamsteed, s, observations, in, 1680, 1681, although, he, was, to, accurately, calculate, the, orbit, of, the, comet, of, 1682, he, was, inaccurate, in, his, calculations, of, the, orbit, of, comet, kirch, they, indicated, a, periodicity, of, 575, years, thus, appearing, in, the, years, 531, and, 1106, and, presumably, heralding, the, death, of, julius, caesar, in, a, like, fashion, in, 45, bc, it, is, now, known, to, have, an, orbital, period, of, circa, 10, 000, years, in, 1691, halley, built, a, diving, bell, a, device, in, which, the, atmosphere, was, replenished, by, way, of, weighted, barrels, of, air, sent, down, from, the, surface, in, a, demonstration, halley, and, five, companions, dived, to, 60, feet, 18, m, in, the, river, thames, and, remained, there, for, over, an, hour, and, a, half, halley, s, bell, was, of, little, use, for, practical, salvage, work, as, it, was, very, heavy, but, he, made, improvements, to, it, over, time, later, extending, his, underwater, exposure, time, to, over, 4, hours, halley, suffered, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, cases, of, middle, ear, barotrauma, that, same, year, at, a, meeting, of, the, royal, society, halley, introduced, a, rudimentary, working, model, of, a, magnetic, compass, using, a, liquid, filled, housing, to, damp, the, swing, and, wobble, of, the, magnetised, needle, in, 1691, halley, sought, the, post, of, savilian, professor, of, astronomy, at, oxford, while, a, candidate, for, the, position, halley, faced, the, animosity, of, the, astronomer, royal, john, flamsteed, and, the, anglican, church, questioned, his, religious, views, largely, on, the, grounds, that, he, had, doubted, the, earth, s, age, as, given, in, the, bible, after, flamsteed, wrote, to, newton, to, rally, support, against, halley, newton, wrote, back, in, hopes, of, reconciliation, but, was, unsuccessful, halley, s, candidacy, was, opposed, by, both, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, john, tillotson, and, bishop, stillingfleet, and, the, post, went, instead, to, david, gregory, who, had, newton, s, support, in, 1692, halley, put, forth, the, idea, of, a, hollow, earth, consisting, of, a, shell, about, 500, miles, 800, km, thick, two, inner, concentric, shells, and, an, innermost, core, he, suggested, that, atmospheres, separated, these, shells, and, that, each, shell, had, its, own, magnetic, poles, with, each, sphere, rotating, at, a, different, speed, halley, proposed, this, scheme, to, explain, anomalous, compass, readings, he, envisaged, each, inner, region, as, having, an, atmosphere, and, being, luminous, and, possibly, inhabited, and, speculated, that, escaping, gas, caused, the, aurora, borealis, he, suggested, auroral, rays, are, due, to, particles, which, are, affected, by, the, magnetic, field, the, rays, parallel, to, earth, s, magnetic, field, in, 1693, halley, published, an, article, on, life, annuities, which, featured, an, analysis, of, age, at, death, on, the, basis, of, the, breslau, statistics, caspar, neumann, had, been, able, to, provide, this, article, allowed, the, british, government, to, sell, life, annuities, at, an, appropriate, price, based, on, the, age, of, the, purchaser, halley, s, work, strongly, influenced, the, development, of, actuarial, science, the, construction, of, the, life, table, for, breslau, which, followed, more, primitive, work, by, john, graunt, is, now, seen, as, a, major, event, in, the, history, of, demography, the, royal, society, censured, halley, for, suggesting, in, 1694, that, the, story, of, noah, s, flood, might, be, an, account, of, a, cometary, impact, a, similar, theory, was, independently, suggested, three, centuries, later, but, is, generally, rejected, by, geologists, in, 1696, newton, was, appointed, as, warden, of, the, royal, mint, and, nominated, halley, as, deputy, comptroller, of, the, chester, mint, halley, spent, two, years, supervising, coin, production, while, there, he, caught, two, clerks, pilfering, precious, metals, he, and, the, local, warden, spoke, out, about, the, scheme, unaware, that, the, local, master, of, the, mint, was, profiting, from, it, in, 1698, the, czar, of, russia, later, known, as, peter, the, great, was, on, a, visit, to, england, and, hoped, newton, would, be, available, to, entertain, him, newton, sent, halley, in, his, place, he, and, the, czar, bonded, over, science, and, brandy, according, to, one, disputed, account, when, both, of, them, were, drunk, one, night, halley, jovially, pushed, the, czar, around, deptford, in, a, wheelbarrow, in, 1698, at, the, behest, of, king, william, iii, halley, was, given, command, of, the, paramour, a, 52, feet, 16, m, pink, so, that, he, could, carry, out, investigations, in, the, south, atlantic, into, the, laws, governing, the, variation, of, the, compass, as, well, as, to, refine, the, coordinates, of, the, english, colonies, in, the, americas, on, 19, august, 1698, he, took, command, of, the, ship, and, in, november, 1698, sailed, on, what, was, the, first, purely, scientific, voyage, by, an, english, naval, vessel, unfortunately, problems, of, insubordination, arose, over, questions, of, halley, s, competence, to, command, a, vessel, halley, returned, the, ship, to, england, to, proceed, against, officers, in, july, 1699, the, result, was, a, mild, rebuke, for, his, men, and, dissatisfaction, for, halley, who, felt, the, court, had, been, too, lenient, halley, thereafter, received, a, temporary, commission, as, a, captain, in, the, royal, navy, recommissioned, the, paramour, on, 24, august, 1699, and, sailed, again, in, september, 1699, to, make, extensive, observations, on, the, conditions, of, terrestrial, magnetism, this, task, he, accomplished, in, a, second, atlantic, voyage, which, lasted, until, 6, september, 1700, and, extended, from, 52, degrees, north, to, 52, degrees, south, the, results, were, published, in, general, chart, of, the, variation, of, the, compass, 1701, this, was, the, first, such, chart, to, be, published, and, the, first, on, which, isogonic, or, halleyan, lines, appeared, the, use, of, such, lines, inspired, later, ideas, such, as, those, of, isotherms, by, alexander, von, humboldt, in, his, maps, in, 1701, halley, made, a, third, and, final, voyage, on, the, paramour, to, study, the, tides, of, the, english, channel, in, 1702, he, was, dispatched, by, queen, anne, on, diplomatic, missions, to, other, european, leaders, the, preface, to, awnsham, and, john, churchill, s, collection, of, voyages, and, travels, 1704, supposedly, written, by, john, locke, or, by, halley, valourised, expeditions, such, as, these, as, part, of, a, grand, expansion, of, european, knowledge, of, the, world, what, was, cosmography, before, these, discoveries, but, an, imperfect, fragment, of, a, science, scarce, deserving, so, good, a, name, when, all, the, known, world, was, only, europe, a, small, part, of, africk, and, the, lesser, portion, of, asia, so, that, of, this, terraqueous, globe, not, one, sixth, part, had, ever, been, seen, or, heard, of, nay, so, great, was, the, ignorance, of, man, in, this, particular, that, learned, persons, made, a, doubt, of, its, being, round, others, no, less, knowing, imagin, d, all, they, were, not, acquainted, with, desart, and, uninhabitable, but, now, geography, and, hydrography, have, receiv, d, some, perfection, by, the, pains, of, so, many, mariners, and, travelers, who, to, evince, the, rotundity, of, the, earth, and, water, have, sail, d, and, travell, d, round, it, as, has, been, here, made, appear, to, show, there, is, no, part, uninhabitable, unless, the, frozen, polar, regions, have, visited, all, other, countries, tho, never, so, remote, which, they, have, found, well, peopl, d, and, most, of, them, rich, and, delightful, astronomy, has, receiv, d, the, addition, of, many, constellations, never, seen, before, natural, and, moral, history, is, embelish, d, with, the, most, beneficial, increase, of, so, many, thousands, of, plants, it, had, never, before, receiv, d, so, many, drugs, and, spices, such, variety, of, beasts, birds, and, fishes, such, rarities, in, minerals, mountains, and, waters, such, unaccountable, diversity, of, climates, and, men, and, in, them, of, complexions, tempers, habits, manners, politicks, and, religions, to, conclude, the, empire, of, europe, is, now, extended, to, the, utmost, bounds, of, the, earth, where, several, of, its, nations, have, conquests, and, colonies, these, and, many, more, are, the, advantages, drawn, from, the, labours, of, those, who, expose, themselves, to, the, dangers, of, the, vast, ocean, and, of, unknown, nations, which, those, who, sit, still, at, home, abundantly, reap, in, every, kind, and, the, relation, of, one, traveler, is, an, incentive, to, stir, up, another, to, imitate, him, whilst, the, rest, of, mankind, in, their, accounts, without, stirring, a, foot, compass, the, earth, and, seas, visit, all, countries, and, converse, with, all, nations, in, november, 1703, halley, was, appointed, savilian, professor, of, geometry, at, the, university, of, oxford, his, theological, enemies, john, tillotson, and, bishop, stillingfleet, having, died, in, 1705, applying, historical, astronomy, methods, he, published, the, paper, astronomiae, cometicae, synopsis, a, synopsis, of, the, astronomy, of, comets, in, this, he, stated, his, belief, that, the, comet, sightings, of, 1456, 1531, 1607, and, 1682, were, of, the, same, comet, and, that, it, would, return, in, 1758, halley, did, not, live, to, witness, the, comet, s, return, but, when, it, did, the, comet, became, generally, known, as, halley, s, comet, by, 1706, halley, had, learned, arabic, and, completed, the, translation, started, by, edward, bernard, of, books, v, vii, of, apollonius, s, conics, from, copies, found, at, leiden, and, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, he, also, completed, a, new, translation, of, the, first, four, books, from, the, original, greek, that, had, been, started, by, the, late, david, gregory, he, published, these, along, with, his, own, reconstruction, of, book, viii, in, the, first, complete, latin, edition, in, 1710, the, same, year, he, received, an, honorary, degree, of, doctor, of, laws, from, oxford, in, 1716, halley, suggested, a, high, precision, measurement, of, the, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, by, timing, the, transit, of, venus, in, doing, so, he, was, following, the, method, described, by, james, gregory, in, optica, promota, in, which, the, design, of, the, gregorian, telescope, is, also, described, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, halley, possessed, and, had, read, this, book, given, that, the, gregorian, design, was, the, principal, telescope, design, used, in, astronomy, in, halley, s, day, it, is, not, to, halley, s, credit, that, he, failed, to, acknowledge, gregory, s, priority, in, this, matter, in, 1717, 18, he, discovered, the, proper, motion, of, the, fixed, stars, publishing, this, in, 1718, by, comparing, his, astrometric, measurements, with, those, given, in, ptolemy, s, almagest, arcturus, and, sirius, were, two, noted, to, have, moved, significantly, the, latter, having, progressed, 30, arc, minutes, about, the, diameter, of, the, moon, southwards, in, 1800, years, in, 1720, together, with, his, friend, the, antiquarian, william, stukeley, halley, participated, in, the, first, attempt, to, scientifically, date, stonehenge, assuming, that, the, monument, had, been, laid, out, using, a, magnetic, compass, stukeley, and, halley, attempted, to, calculate, the, perceived, deviation, introducing, corrections, from, existing, magnetic, records, and, suggested, three, dates, 460, bc, ad, 220, and, ad, 920, the, earliest, being, the, one, accepted, these, dates, were, wrong, by, thousands, of, years, but, the, idea, that, scientific, methods, could, be, used, to, date, ancient, monuments, was, revolutionary, in, its, day, halley, succeeded, john, flamsteed, in, 1720, as, astronomer, royal, a, position, halley, held, until, his, death, in, 1742, at, the, age, of, 85, he, was, buried, in, the, graveyard, of, the, old, church, of, st, margaret, s, lee, since, rebuilt, at, lee, terrace, blackheath, he, was, interred, in, the, same, vault, as, the, astronomer, royal, john, pond, the, unmarked, grave, of, the, astronomer, royal, nathaniel, bliss, is, nearby, his, original, tombstone, was, transferred, by, the, admiralty, when, the, original, lee, church, was, demolished, and, rebuilt, it, can, be, seen, today, on, the, southern, wall, of, the, camera, obscura, at, the, royal, observatory, greenwich, his, marked, grave, can, be, seen, at, st, margaret, s, church, lee, terrace, despite, the, persistent, misconception, that, halley, received, a, knighthood, it, is, not, the, case, the, idea, can, be, tracked, back, to, american, astronomical, texts, such, as, william, augustus, norton, s, 1839, an, elementary, treatise, on, astronomy, possibly, due, to, halley, s, royal, occupations, and, connections, to, sir, isaac, newton, halley, married, mary, tooke, in, 1682, and, settled, in, islington, the, couple, had, three, children, there, are, three, pronunciations, of, the, surname, halley, these, are, h, l, i, h, e, l, i, and, h, l, i, as, a, personal, surname, the, most, common, pronunciation, in, the, 21st, century, both, in, great, britain, and, in, the, united, states, is, h, l, i, rhymes, with, valley, this, is, the, personal, pronunciation, used, by, most, halleys, living, in, london, today, this, is, useful, guidance, but, does, not, of, course, tell, us, how, the, name, should, be, pronounced, in, the, context, of, the, astronomer, or, the, comet, the, alternative, h, e, l, i, is, much, more, common, in, the, latter, context, than, it, is, when, used, as, a, modern, surname, colin, ronan, one, of, halley, s, biographers, preferred, h, l, i, contemporary, accounts, spell, his, name, hailey, hayley, haley, haly, halley, hawley, and, hawly, and, presumably, pronunciations, varied, similarly, as, for, his, given, name, although, the, spelling, edmund, is, quite, common, edmond, is, what, halley, himself, used, according, to, a, 1902, article, though, a, 2007, international, comet, quarterly, article, disputes, this, commenting, that, in, his, published, works, he, used, edmund, 22, times, and, edmond, only, 3, times, with, several, other, variations, used, as, well, such, as, the, latinised, edmundus, much, of, the, debate, stems, from, the, fact, that, in, halley, s, own, time, english, spelling, conventions, were, not, yet, standardised, and, so, he, himself, used, multiple, spellings
