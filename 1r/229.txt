nabat, a, woman, of, great, beauty, to, whom, some, of, his, poems, are, addressed, ravished, by, her, beauty, but, knowing, that, his, love, for, her, would, not, be, requited, he, allegedly, held, his, first, mystic, vigil, in, his, desire, to, realize, this, union, still, he, encountered, a, being, of, surpassing, beauty, who, identified, himself, as, an, angel, and, his, further, attempts, at, union, became, mystic, a, pursuit, of, spiritual, union, with, the, divine, at, 60, he, is, said, to, have, begun, a, chilla, nashini, a, 40, day, and, night, vigil, by, sitting, in, a, circle,

work, was, first, translated, into, english, in, 1771, by, william, jones, it, would, leave, a, mark, on, such, western, writers, as, thoreau, goethe, w, b, yeats, in, his, prose, anthology, book, of, essays, discoveries, as, well, as, gaining, a, positive, reception, within, west, bengal, in, india, among, some, of, the, most, prolific, religious, leaders, and, poets, in, this, province,

in, 1932, also, made, a, homage, visit, to, hafez, s, tomb, in, shiraz, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, the, last, referred, to, him, as, a, poet, s, poet, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, has, his, character, sherlock, holmes, state, that, there, is, as, much, sense, in, hafiz, as, in, horace, and, as, much, knowledge, of, the, world, in, a, case, of, identity, friedrich, engels, mentioned, him, in, an, 1853, letter, to, karl, marx, there, is, no, definitive, version, of, his, collected, works, or, d, v, n, editions, vary, from, 573, to, 994, poems, only, since, the, 1940s, has, a, sustained, scholarly, attempt, by, mas, ud, farzad, qasim, ghani, and, others, in, iran, been, made, to, authenticate, his, work, and, to, remove, errors, introduced, by, later, copyists, and, censors, however, the, reliability, of, such, work, has, been, questioned, and, in, the, words, of, h, fez, scholar, iraj, bashiri, there, remains, little, hope, from, there, i, e, iran, for, an, authenticated, diwan, hafez, is, the, most, popular, poet, in, iran, his, works, can, be, found, in, almost, every, iranian, home, in, fact, october, 12, is, celebrated, as, hafez, day, in, iran, his, tomb, is, crowded, with, devotees, who, visit, the, site, and, the, atmosphere, is, festive, with, visitors, singing, and, reciting, their, favorite, hafez, poems, many, iranians, use, divan, of, hafez, for, bibliomancy, iranian, families, usually, have, a, divan, in, their, house, and, when, they, get, together, during, the, nowruz, or, yald, night, they, open, it, to, a, random, page, and, read, the, poem, on, it, which, they, believe, to, be, an, indication, of, things, that, will, happen, in, the, future, in, the, genre, of, persian, traditional, music, hafez, along, with, saadi, shirazi, have, been, the, most, popular, poets, in, the, art, of, v, z, non, metered, form, of, singing, also, the, form, s, qi, n, meh, in, the, radif, of, persian, music, is, based, on, the, same, title, by, hafez, a, number, of, contemporary, composers, such, as, parviz, meshkatian, sheydaie, hossein, alizadeh, ahu, ye, vahshi, mohammad, reza, lotfi, golest, n, and, siamak, aghaie, y, d, b, d, have, composed, metric, songs, tasnif, based, on, ghazals, of, hafez, which, have, become, very, popular, in, the, genre, of, classical, music, hayedeh, performed, the, song, padeshah, e, khooban, with, music, by, farid, zoland, the, ottoman, composer, buhurizade, mustafa, itri, composed, his, magnum, opus, neva, k, r, based, upon, one, of, hafez, s, poems, the, polish, composer, karol, szymanowski, composed, the, love, songs, of, hafiz, based, upon, a, german, translation, of, hafez, poems, many, afghan, singers, including, ahmad, zahir, and, abdul, rahim, sarban, have, composed, songs, such, as, ay, padeshah, e, khooban, gar, zulfe, parayshanat, the, question, of, whether, his, work, is, to, be, interpreted, literally, mystically, or, both, has, been, a, source, of, contention, among, western, scholars, on, the, one, hand, some, of, his, early, readers, such, as, william, jones, saw, in, him, a, conventional, lyricist, similar, to, european, love, poets, such, as, petrarch, others, scholars, such, as, henry, wilberforce, clarke, saw, him, as, purely, a, poet, of, didactic, ecstatic, mysticism, in, the, manner, of, rumi, a, view, that, a, minority, of, twentieth, century, critics, and, literary, historians, have, come, to, challenge, ralph, waldo, emerson, rejected, the, sufistic, view, of, wine, in, hafez, s, poems, this, confusion, stems, from, the, fact, that, early, in, persian, literary, history, the, poetic, vocabulary, was, usurped, by, mystics, who, believed, that, the, ineffable, could, be, better, approached, in, poetry, than, in, prose, in, composing, poems, of, mystic, content, they, imbued, every, word, and, image, with, mystical, undertones, causing, mysticism, and, lyricism, to, converge, into, a, single, tradition, as, a, result, no, fourteenth, century, persian, poet, could, write, a, lyrical, poem, without, having, a, flavor, of, mysticism, forced, on, it, by, the, poetic, vocabulary, itself, while, some, poets, such, as, ubayd, zakani, attempted, to, distance, themselves, from, this, fused, mystical, lyrical, tradition, by, writing, satires, hafez, embraced, the, fusion, and, thrived, on, it, wheeler, thackston, has, said, of, this, that, hafez, sang, a, rare, blend, of, human, and, mystic, love, so, balanced, that, it, is, impossible, to, separate, one, from, the, other, for, reasons, such, as, that, the, history, of, the, translation, of, h, fez, is, fraught, with, complications, and, few, translations, into, western, languages, have, been, wholly, successful, one, of, the, figurative, gestures, for, which, he, is, most, famous, and, which, is, among, the, most, difficult, to, translate, is, h, m, or, artful, punning, thus, a, word, such, as, gowhar, which, could, mean, both, essence, truth, and, pearl, would, take, on, both, meanings, at, once, as, in, a, phrase, such, as, a, pearl, essential, truth, outside, the, shell, of, superficial, existence, hafez, often, took, advantage, of, the, aforementioned, lack, of, distinction, between, lyrical, mystical, and, panegyric, writing, by, using, highly, intellectualized, elaborate, metaphors, and, images, to, suggest, multiple, possible, meanings, for, example, a, couplet, from, one, of, hafez, s, poems, reads, last, night, from, the, cypress, branch, the, nightingale, sang, in, old, persian, tones, the, lesson, of, spiritual, stations, the, cypress, tree, is, a, symbol, both, of, the, beloved, and, of, a, regal, presence, the, nightingale, and, birdsong, evoke, the, traditional, setting, for, human, love, the, lessons, of, spiritual, stations, suggest, obviously, a, mystical, undertone, as, well, though, the, word, for, spiritual, could, also, be, translated, as, intrinsically, meaningful, therefore, the, words, could, signify, at, once, a, prince, addressing, his, devoted, followers, a, lover, courting, a, beloved, and, the, reception, of, spiritual, wisdom, though, hafez, is, well, known, for, his, poetry, he, is, less, commonly, recognized, for, his, intellectual, and, political, contributions, a, defining, feature, of, hafez, poetry, is, its, ironic, tone, and, the, theme, of, hypocrisy, widely, believed, to, be, a, critique, of, the, religious, and, ruling, establishments, of, the, time, persian, satire, developed, during, the, 14th, century, within, the, courts, of, the, mongol, empire, in, this, period, hafez, and, other, notable, early, satirists, such, as, ubayd, zakani, produced, a, body, of, work, that, has, since, become, a, template, for, the, use, of, satire, as, a, political, device, many, of, his, critiques, are, believed, to, be, targeted, at, the, rule, of, mubariz, al, din, muhammad, specifically, towards, the, disintegration, of, important, public, and, private, institutions, his, work, particularly, his, imaginative, references, to, monasteries, convents, shahneh, and, muhtasib, ignored, the, religious, taboos, of, his, period, and, he, found, humor, in, some, of, his, society, s, religious, doctrines, employing, humor, polemically, has, since, become, a, common, practice, in, iranian, public, discourse, and, satire, is, now, perhaps, the, de, facto, language, of, iranian, social, commentary, a, standard, modern, english, edition, of, hafez, is, faces, of, love, 2012, translated, by, dick, davis, for, penguin, classics, beloved, 81, poems, from, hafez,

would, have, expected, their, readers, to, know, an, abridged, version, exists, titled, hafiz, of, shiraz, thirty, poems, an, introduction, to, the, sufi, master, divan, hafez, is, a, book, containing, all, the, remaining, poems, of, hafez, most, of, these, poems, are, in, persian, and, the, most, crucial, part, of, this, divan, is, ghazals, there, are, poems, in, other, poetic, formats, such, as, piece, ode, masnavi, and, quatrain, in, this, divan, there, is, no, evidence, that, most, of, hafez, s, poems, were, destroyed, in, addition, hafez, was, very, famous, during, his, lifetime, therefore, the, small, number, of, poetry, in, the, court, indicates, that, he, was, not, a, prolific, poet, hafez, s, divan, was, probably, compiled, for, the, first, time, by, mohammad, glendam, after, his, death, of, course, some, unconfirmed, reports, indicate, that, hafez, published, his, court, in, ah, 770, 1368, that, is, edited, more, than, twenty, years, before, his, death, the, year,
