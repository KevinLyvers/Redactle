trips, to, italy, at, 17, he, was, a, musician, at, the, salzburg, court, but, grew, restless, and, travelled, in, search, of, a, better, position, mozart, s, search, for, employment, led, to, positions, in, paris, mannheim, munich, and, again, in, salzburg, during, which, he, wrote, his, five, violin, concertos, sinfonia, concertante, and, concerto, for, flute, and, harp, as, well, as,

in, the, jupiter, symphony, the, serenade, eine, kleine, nachtmusik, his, clarinet, concerto, the, four, operas, le, nozze, di, figaro, don, giovanni, cos, fan, tutte, and, the, magic, flute, and, his, requiem, the, requiem, was, largely, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, at, age, 35, the, circumstances, of, which, are, uncertain, and, much, mythologised, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, was, born, on, 27, january, 1756, to, leopold, mozart, and, anna, maria, n, e, pertl, at, getreidegasse, 9, in, salzburg, salzburg, was, the, capital, of, the, archbishopric, of, salzburg, an, ecclesiastic, principality, in, the, holy, roman, empire, today, in, austria, he, was, the, youngest, of, seven, children, five, of, whom, died, in, infancy, his, elder, sister, was, maria, anna, mozart, 1751, 1829, nicknamed, nannerl, mozart, was, baptised, the, day, after, his, birth, at, st, rupert, s, cathedral, in, salzburg, the, baptismal, record, gives, his, name, in, latinized, form, as, joannes, chrysostomus, wolfgangus, theophilus, mozart, he, generally, called, himself, wolfgang, amad, mozart, as, an, adult, but, his, name, had, many, variants, leopold, mozart, a, native, of, augsburg, then, an, imperial, free, city, in, the, holy, roman, empire, was, a, minor, composer, and, an, experienced, teacher, in, 1743, he, was, appointed, as, the, fourth, violinist, in, the, musical, establishment, of, count, leopold, anton, von, firmian, the, ruling, prince, archbishop, of, salzburg, four, years, later, he, married, anna, maria, in, salzburg, leopold, became, the, orchestra, s, deputy, kapellmeister, in, 1763, during, the, year, of, his, son, s, birth, leopold, published, a, violin, textbook, versuch, einer, gr, ndlichen, violinschule, which, achieved, success, when, nannerl, was, seven, she, began, keyboard, lessons, with, her, father, while, her, three, year, old, brother, looked, on, years, later, after, her, brother, s, death, she, reminisced, he, often, spent, much, time, at, the, clavier, picking, out, thirds, which, he, was, ever, striking, and, his, pleasure, showed, that, it, sounded, good, in, the, fourth, year, of, his, age, his, father, for, a, game, as, it, were, began, to, teach, him, a, few, minuets, and, pieces, at, the, clavier, he, could, play, it, faultlessly, and, with, the, greatest, delicacy, and, keeping, exactly, in, time, at, the, age, of, five, he, was, already, composing, little, pieces, which, he, played, to, his, father, who, wrote, them, down, these, early, pieces, k, 1, 5, were, recorded, in, the, nannerl, notenbuch, there, is, some, scholarly, debate, about, whether, mozart, was, four, or, five, years, old, when, he, created, his, first, musical, compositions, though, there, is, little, doubt, that, mozart, composed, his, first, three, pieces, of, music, within, a, few, weeks, of, each, other, k, 1a, 1b, and, 1c, in, his, early, years, wolfgang, s, father, was, his, only, teacher, along, with, music, he, taught, his, children, languages, and, academic, subjects, biographer, solomon, notes, that, while, leopold, was, a, devoted, teacher, to, his, children, there, is, evidence, that, mozart, was, keen, to, progress, beyond, what, he, was, taught, his, first, ink, spattered, composition, and, his, precocious, efforts, with, the, violin, were, of, his, initiative, and, came, as, a, surprise, to, leopold, who, eventually, gave, up, composing, when, his, son, s, musical, talents, became, evident, while, wolfgang, was, young, his, family, made, several, european, journeys, in, which, he, and, nannerl, performed, as, child, prodigies, these, began, with, an, exhibition, in, 1762, at, the, court, of, prince, elector, maximilian, iii, of, bavaria, in, munich, and, at, the, imperial, courts, in, vienna, and, prague, a, long, concert, tour, followed, spanning, three, and, a, half, years, taking, the, family, to, the, courts, of, munich, mannheim, paris, london, dover, the, hague, amsterdam, utrecht, mechelen, and, again, to, paris, and, back, home, via, z, rich, donaueschingen, and, munich, during, this, trip, wolfgang, met, many, musicians, and, acquainted, himself, with, the, works, of, other, composers, a, particularly, significant, influence, was, johann, christian, bach, whom, he, visited, in, london, in, 1764, and, 1765, when, he, was, eight, years, old, mozart, wrote, his, first, symphony, most, of, which, was, probably, transcribed, by, his, father, the, family, trips, were, often, challenging, and, travel, conditions, were, primitive, they, had, to, wait, for, invitations, and, reimbursement, from, the, nobility, and, they, endured, long, near, fatal, illnesses, far, from, home, first, leopold, london, summer, 1764, then, both, children, the, hague, autumn, 1765, the, family, again, went, to, vienna, in, late, 1767, and, remained, there, until, december, 1768, after, one, year, in, salzburg, leopold, and, wolfgang, set, off, for, italy, leaving, anna, maria, and, nannerl, at, home, this, tour, lasted, from, december, 1769, to, march, 1771, as, with, earlier, journeys, leopold, wanted, to, display, his, son, s, abilities, as, a, performer, and, a, rapidly, maturing, composer, wolfgang, met, josef, myslive, ek, and, giovanni, battista, martini, in, bologna, and, was, accepted, as, a, member, of, the, famous, accademia, filarmonica, there, exists, a, myth, according, to, which, while, in, rome, he, heard, gregorio, allegri, s, miserere, twice, in, performance, in, the, sistine, chapel, allegedly, he, subsequently, wrote, it, out, from, memory, thus, producing, the, first, unauthorized, copy, of, this, closely, guarded, property, of, the, vatican, however, both, origin, and, plausibility, of, this, account, are, disputed, in, milan, mozart, wrote, the, opera, mitridate, re, di, ponto, 1770, which, was, performed, with, success, this, led, to, further, opera, commissions, he, returned, with, his, father, twice, to, milan, august, december, 1771, october, 1772, march, 1773, for, the, composition, and, premieres, of, ascanio, in, alba, 1771, and, lucio, silla, 1772, leopold, hoped, these, visits, would, result, in, a, professional, appointment, for, his, son, and, indeed, ruling, archduke, ferdinand, contemplated, hiring, mozart, but, owing, to, his, mother, empress, maria, theresa, s, reluctance, to, employ, useless, people, the, matter, was, dropped, and, leopold, s, hopes, were, never, realized, toward, the, end, of, the, journey, mozart, wrote, the, solo, motet, exsultate, jubilate, k, 165, after, finally, returning, with, his, father, from, italy, on, 13, march, 1773, mozart, was, employed, as, a, court, musician, by, the, ruler, of, salzburg, prince, archbishop, hieronymus, colloredo, the, composer, had, many, friends, and, admirers, in, salzburg, and, had, the, opportunity, to, work, in, many, genres, including, symphonies, sonatas, string, quartets, masses, serenades, and, a, few, minor, operas, between, april, and, december, 1775, mozart, developed, an, enthusiasm, for, violin, concertos, producing, a, series, of, five, the, only, ones, he, ever, wrote, which, steadily, increased, in, their, musical, sophistication, the, last, three, k, 216, k, 218, k, 219, are, now, staples, of, the, repertoire, in, 1776, he, turned, his, efforts, to, piano, concertos, culminating, in, the, e, concerto, k, 271, of, early, 1777, considered, by, critics, to, be, a, breakthrough, work, despite, these, artistic, successes, mozart, grew, increasingly, discontented, with, salzburg, and, redoubled, his, efforts, to, find, a, position, elsewhere, one, reason, was, his, low, salary, 150, florins, a, year, mozart, longed, to, compose, operas, and, salzburg, provided, only, rare, occasions, for, these, the, situation, worsened, in, 1775, when, the, court, theatre, was, closed, especially, since, the, other, theatre, in, salzburg, was, primarily, reserved, for, visiting, troupes, two, long, expeditions, in, search, of, work, interrupted, this, long, salzburg, stay, mozart, and, his, father, visited, vienna, from, 14, july, to, 26, september, 1773, and, munich, from, 6, december, 1774, to, march, 1775, neither, visit, was, successful, though, the, munich, journey, resulted, in, a, popular, success, with, the, premiere, of, mozart, s, opera, la, finta, giardiniera, in, august, 1777, mozart, resigned, his, position, at, salzburg, and, on, 23, september, ventured, out, once, more, in, search, of, employment, with, visits, to, augsburg, mannheim, paris, and, munich, mozart, became, acquainted, with, members, of, the, famous, orchestra, in, mannheim, the, best, in, europe, at, the, time, he, also, fell, in, love, with, aloysia, weber, one, of, four, daughters, of, a, musical, family, there, were, prospects, of, employment, in, mannheim, but, they, came, to, nothing, and, mozart, left, for, paris, on, 14, march, 1778, to, continue, his, search, one, of, his, letters, from, paris, hints, at, a, possible, post, as, an, organist, at, versailles, but, mozart, was, not, interested, in, such, an, appointment, he, fell, into, debt, and, took, to, pawning, valuables, the, nadir, of, the, visit, occurred, when, mozart, s, mother, was, taken, ill, and, died, on, 3, july, 1778, there, had, been, delays, in, calling, a, doctor, probably, according, to, halliwell, because, of, a, lack, of, funds, mozart, stayed, with, melchior, grimm, at, marquise, d, pinay, s, residence, 5, rue, de, la, chauss, e, d, antin, while, mozart, was, in, paris, his, father, was, pursuing, opportunities, of, employment, for, him, in, salzburg, with, the, support, of, the, local, nobility, mozart, was, offered, a, post, as, court, organist, and, concertmaster, the, annual, salary, was, 450, florins, but, he, was, reluctant, to, accept, by, that, time, relations, between, grimm, and, mozart, had, cooled, and, mozart, moved, out, after, leaving, paris, in, september, 1778, for, strasbourg, he, lingered, in, mannheim, and, munich, still, hoping, to, obtain, an, appointment, outside, salzburg, in, munich, he, again, encountered, aloysia, now, a, very, successful, singer, but, she, was, no, longer, interested, in, him, mozart, finally, returned, to, salzburg, on, 15, january, 1779, and, took, up, his, new, appointment, but, his, discontent, with, salzburg, remained, undiminished, among, the, better, known, works, which, mozart, wrote, on, the, paris, journey, are, the, a, minor, piano, sonata, k, 310, 300d, the, paris, symphony, no, 31, which, were, performed, in, paris, on, 12, and, 18, june, 1778, and, the, concerto, for, flute, and, harp, in, c, major, k, 299, 297c, in, january, 1781, mozart, s, opera, idomeneo, premiered, with, considerable, success, in, munich, the, following, march, mozart, was, summoned, to, vienna, where, his, employer, archbishop, colloredo, was, attending, the, celebrations, for, the, accession, of, joseph, ii, to, the, austrian, throne, for, colloredo, this, was, simply, a, matter, of, wanting, his, musical, servant, to, be, at, hand, mozart, indeed, was, required, to, dine, in, colloredo, s, establishment, with, the, valets, and, cooks, he, planned, a, bigger, career, as, he, continued, in, the, archbishop, s, service, for, example, he, wrote, to, his, father, my, main, goal, right, now, is, to, meet, the, emperor, in, some, agreeable, fashion, i, am, absolutely, determined, he, should, get, to, know, me, i, would, be, so, happy, if, i, could, whip, through, my, opera, for, him, and, then, play, a, fugue, or, two, for, that, s, what, he, likes, mozart, did, indeed, soon, meet, the, emperor, who, eventually, was, to, support, his, career, substantially, with, commissions, and, a, part, time, position, in, the, same, letter, to, his, father, just, quoted, mozart, outlined, his, plans, to, participate, as, a, soloist, in, the, concerts, of, the, tonk, nstler, societ, t, a, prominent, benefit, concert, series, this, plan, as, well, came, to, pass, after, the, local, nobility, prevailed, on, colloredo, to, drop, his, opposition, colloredo, s, wish, to, prevent, mozart, from, performing, outside, his, establishment, was, in, other, cases, carried, through, raising, the, composer, s, anger, one, example, was, a, chance, to, perform, before, the, emperor, at, countess, thun, s, for, a, fee, equal, to, half, of, his, yearly, salzburg, salary, the, quarrel, with, the, archbishop, came, to, a, head, in, may, mozart, attempted, to, resign, and, was, refused, the, following, month, permission, was, granted, but, in, a, grossly, insulting, way, the, composer, was, dismissed, literally, with, a, kick, in, the, arse, administered, by, the, archbishop, s, steward, count, arco, mozart, decided, to, settle, in, vienna, as, a, freelance, performer, and, composer, the, quarrel, with, colloredo, was, more, difficult, for, mozart, because, his, father, sided, against, him, hoping, fervently, that, he, would, obediently, follow, colloredo, back, to, salzburg, mozart, s, father, exchanged, intense, letters, with, his, son, urging, him, to, be, reconciled, with, their, employer, mozart, passionately, defended, his, intention, to, pursue, an, independent, career, in, vienna, the, debate, ended, when, mozart, was, dismissed, by, the, archbishop, freeing, himself, both, of, his, employer, and, of, his, father, s, demands, to, return, solomon, characterizes, mozart, s, resignation, as, a, revolutionary, step, that, significantly, altered, the, course, of, his, life, mozart, s, new, career, in, vienna, began, well, he, often, performed, as, a, pianist, notably, in, a, competition, before, the, emperor, with, muzio, clementi, on, 24, december, 1781, and, he, soon, had, established, himself, as, the, finest, keyboard, player, in, vienna, he, also, prospered, as, a, composer, and, in, 1782, completed, the, opera, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, the, abduction, from, the, seraglio, which, premiered, on, 16, july, 1782, and, achieved, considerable, success, the, work, was, soon, being, performed, throughout, german, speaking, europe, and, thoroughly, established, mozart, s, reputation, as, a, composer, near, the, height, of, his, quarrels, with, colloredo, mozart, moved, in, with, the, weber, family, who, had, moved, to, vienna, from, mannheim, the, family, s, father, fridolin, had, died, and, the, webers, were, now, taking, in, lodgers, to, make, ends, meet, after, failing, to, win, the, hand, of, aloysia, weber, who, was, now, married, to, the, actor, and, artist, joseph, lange, mozart, s, interest, shifted, to, the, third, daughter, of, the, family, constanze, the, courtship, did, not, go, entirely, smoothly, surviving, correspondence, indicates, that, mozart, and, constanze, briefly, broke, up, in, april, 1782, over, an, episode, involving, jealousy, constanze, had, permitted, another, young, man, to, measure, her, calves, in, a, parlor, game, mozart, also, faced, a, very, difficult, task, getting, permission, for, the, marriage, from, his, father, leopold, the, marriage, took, place, in, an, atmosphere, of, crisis, daniel, heartz, suggests, that, eventually, constanze, moved, in, with, mozart, which, would, have, placed, her, in, disgrace, by, the, mores, of, the, time, mozart, wrote, to, leopold, on, 31, july, 1782, all, the, good, and, well, intentioned, advice, you, have, sent, fails, to, address, the, case, of, a, man, who, has, already, gone, so, far, with, a, maiden, further, postponement, is, out, of, the, question, heartz, relates, constanze, s, sister, sophie, had, tearfully, declared, that, her, mother, would, send, the, police, after, constanze, if, she, did, not, return, home, on, 4, august, mozart, wrote, to, baroness, von, waldst, tten, asking, can, the, police, here, enter, anyone, s, house, in, this, way, perhaps, it, is, only, a, ruse, of, madame, weber, to, get, her, daughter, back, if, not, i, know, no, better, remedy, than, to, marry, constanze, tomorrow, morning, or, if, possible, today, the, couple, were, finally, married, on, 4, august, 1782, in, st, stephen, s, cathedral, the, day, before, his, father, s, consenting, letter, arrived, in, the, mail, in, the, marriage, contract, constanze, assigns, to, her, bridegroom, five, hundred, gulden, which, the, latter, has, promised, to, augment, with, one, thousand, gulden, with, the, total, to, pass, to, the, survivor, further, all, joint, acquisitions, during, the, marriage, were, to, remain, the, common, property, of, both, the, couple, had, six, children, of, whom, only, two, survived, infancy, in, 1782, and, 1783, mozart, became, intimately, acquainted, with, the, work, of, johann, sebastian, bach, and, george, frideric, handel, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, gottfried, van, swieten, who, owned, many, manuscripts, of, the, baroque, masters, mozart, s, study, of, these, scores, inspired, compositions, in, baroque, style, and, later, influenced, his, musical, language, for, example, in, fugal, passages, in, die, zauberfl, te, the, magic, flute, and, the, finale, of, symphony, no, 41, in, 1783, mozart, and, his, wife, visited, his, family, in, salzburg, his, father, and, sister, were, cordially, polite, to, constanze, but, the, visit, prompted, the, composition, of, one, of, mozart, s, great, liturgical, pieces, the, mass, in, c, minor, though, not, completed, it, was, premiered, in, salzburg, with, constanze, singing, a, solo, part, mozart, met, joseph, haydn, in, vienna, around, 1784, and, the, two, composers, became, friends, when, haydn, visited, vienna, they, sometimes, played, together, in, an, impromptu, string, quartet, mozart, s, six, quartets, dedicated, to, haydn, k, 387, k, 421, k, 428, k, 458, k, 464, and, k, 465, date, from, the, period, 1782, to, 1785, and, are, judged, to, be, a, response, to, haydn, s, opus, 33, set, from, 1781, haydn, wrote, posterity, will, not, see, such, a, talent, again, in, 100, years, and, in, 1785, told, mozart, s, father, i, tell, you, before, god, and, as, an, honest, man, your, son, is, the, greatest, composer, known, to, me, by, person, and, repute, he, has, taste, and, what, is, more, the, greatest, skill, in, composition, from, 1782, to, 1785, mozart, mounted, concerts, with, himself, as, a, soloist, presenting, three, or, four, new, piano, concertos, in, each, season, since, space, in, the, theatres, was, scarce, he, booked, unconventional, venues, a, large, room, in, the, trattnerhof, apartment, building, and, the, ballroom, of, the, mehlgrube, restaurant, the, concerts, were, very, popular, and, his, concertos, premiered, there, are, still, firm, fixtures, in, his, repertoire, solomon, writes, that, during, this, period, mozart, created, a, harmonious, connection, between, an, eager, composer, performer, and, a, delighted, audience, which, was, given, the, opportunity, of, witnessing, the, transformation, and, perfection, of, a, major, musical, genre, with, substantial, returns, from, his, concerts, and, elsewhere, mozart, and, his, wife, adopted, a, more, luxurious, lifestyle, they, moved, to, an, expensive, apartment, with, a, yearly, rent, of, 460, florins, mozart, bought, a, fine, fortepiano, from, anton, walter, for, about, 900, florins, and, a, billiard, table, for, about, 300, the, mozarts, sent, their, son, karl, thomas, to, an, expensive, boarding, school, and, kept, servants, during, this, period, mozart, saved, little, of, his, income, on, 14, december, 1784, mozart, became, a, freemason, admitted, to, the, lodge, zur, wohlt, tigkeit, beneficence, freemasonry, played, an, essential, role, in, the, remainder, of, mozart, s, life, he, attended, meetings, a, number, of, his, friends, were, masons, and, on, various, occasions, he, composed, masonic, music, e, g, the, maurerische, trauermusik, despite, the, great, success, of, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, mozart, did, little, operatic, writing, for, the, next, four, years, producing, only, two, unfinished, works, and, the, one, act, der, schauspieldirektor, he, focused, instead, on, his, career, as, a, piano, soloist, and, writer, of, concertos, around, the, end, of, 1785, mozart, moved, away, from, keyboard, writing, and, began, his, famous, operatic, collaboration, with, the, librettist, lorenzo, da, ponte, the, year, 1786, saw, the, successful, premiere, of, le, nozze, di, figaro, in, vienna, its, reception, in, prague, later, in, the, year, was, even, warmer, and, this, led, to, a, second, collaboration, with, da, ponte, the, opera, don, giovanni, which, premiered, in, october, 1787, to, acclaim, in, prague, but, less, success, in, vienna, during, 1788, the, two, are, among, mozart, s, most, famous, works, and, are, mainstays, of, operatic, repertoire, today, though, at, their, premieres, their, musical, complexity, caused, difficulty, both, for, listeners, and, for, performers, these, developments, were, not, witnessed, by, mozart, s, father, who, had, died, on, 28, may, 1787, in, december, 1787, mozart, finally, obtained, a, steady, post, under, aristocratic, patronage, emperor, joseph, ii, appointed, him, as, his, chamber, composer, a, post, that, had, fallen, vacant, the, previous, month, on, the, death, of, gluck, it, was, a, part, time, appointment, paying, just, 800, florins, per, year, and, required, mozart, only, to, compose, dances, for, the, annual, balls, in, the, redoutensaal, see, mozart, and, dance, this, modest, income, became, important, to, mozart, when, hard, times, arrived, court, records, show, that, joseph, aimed, to, keep, the, esteemed, composer, from, leaving, vienna, in, pursuit, of, better, prospects, in, 1787, the, young, ludwig, van, beethoven, spent, several, weeks, in, vienna, hoping, to, study, with, mozart, no, reliable, records, survive, to, indicate, whether, the, two, composers, ever, met, toward, the, end, of, the, decade, mozart, s, circumstances, worsened, around, 1786, he, had, ceased, to, appear, frequently, in, public, concerts, and, his, income, shrank, this, was, a, difficult, time, for, musicians, in, vienna, because, of, the, austro, turkish, war, both, the, general, level, of, prosperity, and, the, ability, of, the, aristocracy, to, support, music, had, declined, in, 1788, mozart, saw, a, 66, decline, in, his, income, compared, to, his, best, years, in, 1781, by, mid, 1788, mozart, and, his, family, had, moved, from, central, vienna, to, the, suburb, of, alsergrund, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, mozart, aimed, to, reduce, his, rental, expenses, by, moving, to, a, suburb, as, he, wrote, in, his, letter, to, michael, von, puchberg, mozart, had, not, reduced, his, expenses, but, merely, increased, the, housing, space, at, his, disposal, mozart, began, to, borrow, money, most, often, from, his, friend, and, fellow, mason, puchberg, a, pitiful, sequence, of, letters, pleading, for, loans, survives, maynard, solomon, and, others, have, suggested, that, mozart, was, suffering, from, depression, and, it, seems, his, musical, output, slowed, major, works, of, the, period, include, the, last, three, symphonies, nos, 39, 40, and, 41, all, from, 1788, and, the, last, of, the, three, da, ponte, operas, cos, fan, tutte, premiered, in, 1790, around, this, time, mozart, made, some, long, journeys, hoping, to, improve, his, fortunes, visiting, leipzig, dresden, and, berlin, in, the, spring, of, 1789, and, frankfurt, mannheim, and, other, german, cities, in, 1790, mozart, s, last, year, was, until, his, final, illness, struck, a, time, of, high, productivity, and, by, some, accounts, one, of, personal, recovery, he, composed, a, great, deal, including, some, of, his, most, admired, works, the, opera, the, magic, flute, the, final, piano, concerto, k, 595, in, b, the, clarinet, concerto, k, 622, the, last, in, his, series, of, string, quintets, k, 614, in, e, the, motet, ave, verum, corpus, k, 618, and, the, unfinished, requiem, k, 626, mozart, s, financial, situation, a, source, of, anxiety, in, 1790, finally, began, to, improve, although, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, it, appears, that, wealthy, patrons, in, hungary, and, amsterdam, pledged, annuities, to, mozart, in, return, for, the, occasional, composition, he, is, thought, to, have, benefited, from, the, sale, of, dance, music, written, in, his, role, as, imperial, chamber, composer, mozart, no, longer, borrowed, large, sums, from, puchberg, and, began, to, pay, off, his, debts, he, experienced, great, satisfaction, in, the, public, success, of, some, of, his, works, notably, the, magic, flute, which, was, performed, several, times, in, the, short, period, between, its, premiere, and, mozart, s, death, and, the, little, masonic, cantata, k, 623, premiered, on, 17, november, 1791, mozart, fell, ill, while, in, prague, for, the, premiere, on, 6, september, 1791, of, his, opera, la, clemenza, di, tito, which, was, written, in, that, same, year, on, commission, for, emperor, leopold, ii, s, coronation, festivities, he, continued, his, professional, functions, for, some, time, and, conducted, the, premiere, of, the, magic, flute, on, 30, september, his, health, deteriorated, on, 20, november, at, which, point, he, became, bedridden, suffering, from, swelling, pain, and, vomiting, mozart, was, nursed, in, his, final, days, by, his, wife, and, her, youngest, sister, and, was, attended, by, the, family, doctor, thomas, franz, closset, he, was, mentally, occupied, with, the, task, of, finishing, his, requiem, but, the, evidence, that, he, dictated, passages, to, his, student, franz, xaver, s, ssmayr, is, minimal, mozart, died, in, his, home, on, 5, december, 1791, 1791, 12, 05, aged, 35, at, 12, 55, am, the, new, grove, describes, his, funeral, mozart, was, interred, in, a, common, grave, in, accordance, with, contemporary, viennese, custom, at, the, st, marx, cemetery, outside, the, city, on, 7, december, if, as, later, reports, say, no, mourners, attended, that, too, is, consistent, with, viennese, burial, customs, at, the, time, later, otto, jahn, 1856, wrote, that, salieri, s, ssmayr, van, swieten, and, two, other, musicians, were, present, the, tale, of, a, storm, and, snow, is, false, the, day, was, calm, and, mild, the, expression, common, grave, refers, to, neither, a, communal, grave, nor, a, pauper, s, grave, but, an, individual, grave, for, a, member, of, the, common, people, i, e, not, the, aristocracy, common, graves, were, subject, to, excavation, after, ten, years, the, graves, of, aristocrats, were, not, the, cause, of, mozart, s, death, is, not, known, with, certainty, the, official, record, of, hitziges, frieselfieber, severe, miliary, fever, referring, to, a, rash, that, looks, like, millet, seeds, is, more, a, symptomatic, description, than, a, diagnosis, researchers, have, suggested, more, than, a, hundred, causes, of, death, including, acute, rheumatic, fever, streptococcal, infection, trichinosis, influenza, mercury, poisoning, and, a, rare, kidney, ailment, mozart, s, modest, funeral, did, not, reflect, his, standing, with, the, public, as, a, composer, memorial, services, and, concerts, in, vienna, and, prague, were, well, attended, indeed, in, the, period, immediately, after, his, death, his, reputation, rose, substantially, solomon, describes, an, unprecedented, wave, of, enthusiasm, for, his, work, biographies, were, written, first, by, schlichtegroll, niemetschek, and, nissen, and, publishers, vied, to, produce, complete, editions, of, his, works, mozart, s, physical, appearance, was, described, by, tenor, michael, kelly, in, his, reminiscences, a, remarkably, small, man, very, thin, and, pale, with, a, profusion, of, fine, fair, hair, of, which, he, was, rather, vain, his, early, biographer, niemetschek, wrote, there, was, nothing, special, about, physique, he, was, small, and, his, countenance, except, for, his, large, intense, eyes, gave, no, signs, of, his, genius, his, facial, complexion, was, pitted, a, reminder, of, his, childhood, case, of, smallpox, of, his, voice, his, wife, later, wrote, that, it, was, a, tenor, rather, soft, in, speaking, and, delicate, in, singing, but, when, anything, excited, him, or, it, became, necessary, to, exert, it, it, was, both, powerful, and, energetic, he, loved, elegant, clothing, kelly, remembered, him, at, a, rehearsal, was, on, the, stage, with, his, crimson, pelisse, and, gold, laced, cocked, hat, giving, the, time, of, the, music, to, the, orchestra, based, on, paintings, that, researchers, were, able, to, find, of, mozart, he, seemed, to, wear, a, white, wig, for, most, of, his, formal, occasions, researchers, of, the, salzburg, mozarteum, declared, that, only, one, of, his, fourteen, portraits, they, had, found, showed, him, without, his, wig, mozart, usually, worked, long, and, hard, finishing, compositions, at, a, tremendous, pace, as, deadlines, approached, he, often, made, sketches, and, drafts, unlike, beethoven, s, these, are, mostly, not, preserved, as, his, wife, sought, to, destroy, them, after, his, death, mozart, lived, at, the, center, of, the, viennese, musical, world, and, knew, a, significant, number, and, variety, of, people, fellow, musicians, theatrical, performers, fellow, salzburgers, and, aristocrats, including, some, acquaintance, with, emperor, joseph, ii, solomon, considers, his, three, closest, friends, to, have, been, gottfried, von, jacquin, count, august, hatzfeld, and, sigmund, barisani, others, included, his, elder, colleague, joseph, haydn, singers, franz, xaver, gerl, and, benedikt, schack, and, the, horn, player, joseph, leutgeb, leutgeb, and, mozart, carried, on, a, kind, of, friendly, mockery, often, with, leutgeb, as, the, butt, of, mozart, s, practical, jokes, he, enjoyed, billiards, dancing, and, kept, pets, including, a, canary, a, starling, a, dog, and, a, horse, for, recreational, riding, he, had, a, startling, fondness, for, scatological, humour, which, is, preserved, in, his, surviving, letters, notably, those, written, to, his, cousin, maria, anna, thekla, mozart, around, 1777, 1778, and, in, his, correspondence, with, his, sister, and, parents, mozart, also, wrote, scatological, music, a, series, of, canons, that, he, sang, with, his, friends, he, had, an, ear, for, languages, and, having, traveled, all, over, europe, as, a, boy, was, fluent, in, latin, italian, and, french, in, addition, to, his, native, salzburg, dialect, of, german, he, possibly, also, understood, and, spoke, some, english, having, jokingly, written, you, are, an, ass, after, his, 19, year, old, student, thomas, attwood, made, a, thoughtless, mistake, on, his, exercise, papers, mozart, was, raised, a, catholic, and, remained, a, devout, member, of, the, church, throughout, his, life, he, embraced, the, teachings, of, freemasonry, in, 1784, mozart, s, music, like, haydn, s, stands, as, an, archetype, of, the, classical, style, at, the, time, he, began, composing, european, music, was, dominated, by, the, style, galant, a, reaction, against, the, highly, evolved, intricacy, of, the, baroque, progressively, and, in, large, part, at, the, hands, of, mozart, himself, the, contrapuntal, complexities, of, the, late, baroque, emerged, once, more, moderated, and, disciplined, by, new, forms, and, adapted, to, a, new, aesthetic, and, social, milieu, mozart, was, a, versatile, composer, and, wrote, in, every, major, genre, including, symphony, opera, the, solo, concerto, chamber, music, including, string, quartet, and, string, quintet, and, the, piano, sonata, these, forms, were, not, new, but, mozart, advanced, their, technical, sophistication, and, emotional, reach, he, almost, single, handedly, developed, and, popularized, the, classical, piano, concerto, he, wrote, a, great, deal, of, religious, music, including, large, scale, masses, as, well, as, dances, divertimenti, serenades, and, other, forms, of, light, entertainment, the, central, traits, of, the, classical, style, are, all, present, in, mozart, s, music, clarity, balance, and, transparency, are, the, hallmarks, of, his, work, but, simplistic, notions, of, its, delicacy, mask, the, exceptional, power, of, his, finest, masterpieces, such, as, the, piano, concerto, no, 24, in, c, minor, k, 491, the, symphony, no, 40, in, g, minor, k, 550, and, the, opera, don, giovanni, charles, rosen, makes, the, point, forcefully, it, is, only, through, recognizing, the, violence, and, sensuality, at, the, center, of, mozart, s, work, that, we, can, make, a, start, towards, a, comprehension, of, his, structures, and, an, insight, into, his, magnificence, in, a, paradoxical, way, schumann, s, superficial, characterization, of, the, g, minor, symphony, can, help, us, to, see, mozart, s, daemon, more, steadily, in, all, of, mozart, s, supreme, expressions, of, suffering, and, terror, there, is, something, shockingly, voluptuous, during, his, last, decade, mozart, frequently, exploited, chromatic, harmony, a, notable, instance, is, his, string, quartet, in, c, major, k, 465, 1785, whose, introduction, abounds, in, chromatic, suspensions, giving, rise, to, the, work, s, nickname, the, dissonance, quartet, mozart, had, a, gift, for, absorbing, and, adapting, the, valuable, features, of, others, music, his, travels, helped, in, the, forging, of, a, unique, compositional, language, in, london, as, a, child, he, met, j, c, bach, and, heard, his, music, in, paris, mannheim, and, vienna, he, met, with, other, compositional, influences, as, well, as, the, avant, garde, capabilities, of, the, mannheim, orchestra, in, italy, he, encountered, the, italian, overture, and, opera, buffa, both, of, which, deeply, affected, the, evolution, of, his, practice, in, london, and, italy, the, galant, style, was, in, the, ascendent, simple, light, music, with, a, mania, for, cadencing, an, emphasis, on, tonic, dominant, and, subdominant, to, the, exclusion, of, other, harmonies, symmetrical, phrases, and, clearly, articulated, partitions, in, the, overall, form, of, movements, some, of, mozart, s, early, symphonies, are, italian, overtures, with, three, movements, running, into, each, other, many, are, homotonal, all, three, movements, having, the, same, key, signature, with, the, slow, middle, movement, being, in, the, relative, minor, others, mimic, the, works, of, j, c, bach, and, others, show, the, simple, rounded, binary, forms, turned, out, by, viennese, composers, as, mozart, matured, he, progressively, incorporated, more, features, adapted, from, the, baroque, for, example, the, symphony, no, 29, in, a, major, k, 201, has, a, contrapuntal, main, theme, in, its, first, movement, and, experimentation, with, irregular, phrase, lengths, some, of, his, quartets, from, 1773, have, fugal, finales, probably, influenced, by, haydn, who, had, included, three, such, finales, in, his, recently, published, opus, 20, set, the, influence, of, the, sturm, und, drang, storm, and, stress, period, in, music, with, its, brief, foreshadowing, of, the, romantic, era, is, evident, in, the, music, of, both, composers, at, that, time, mozart, s, symphony, no, 25, in, g, minor, k, 183, is, another, excellent, example, mozart, would, sometimes, switch, his, focus, between, operas, and, instrumental, music, he, produced, operas, in, each, of, the, prevailing, styles, opera, buffa, such, as, le, nozze, di, figaro, don, giovanni, and, cos, fan, tutte, opera, seria, such, as, idomeneo, and, singspiel, of, which, die, zauberfl, te, is, the, most, famous, example, by, any, composer, in, his, later, operas, he, employed, subtle, changes, in, instrumentation, orchestral, texture, and, tone, colour, for, emotional, depth, and, to, mark, dramatic, shifts, here, his, advances, in, opera, and, instrumental, composing, interacted, his, increasingly, sophisticated, use, of, the, orchestra, in, the, symphonies, and, concertos, influenced, his, operatic, orchestration, and, his, developing, subtlety, in, using, the, orchestra, to, psychological, effect, in, his, operas, was, in, turn, reflected, in, his, later, non, operatic, compositions, for, unambiguous, identification, of, works, by, mozart, a, k, chel, catalogue, number, is, used, this, is, a, unique, number, assigned, in, regular, chronological, order, to, every, one, of, his, known, works, a, work, is, referenced, by, the, abbreviation, k, or, kv, followed, by, this, number, the, first, edition, of, the, catalogue, was, completed, in, 1862, by, ludwig, von, k, chel, it, has, since, been, repeatedly, updated, as, scholarly, research, improves, knowledge, of, the, dates, and, authenticity, of, individual, works, although, some, of, mozart, s, early, pieces, were, written, for, harpsichord, he, also, became, acquainted, in, his, early, years, with, fortepianos, made, by, regensburg, builder, franz, jakob, sp, th, later, when, mozart, was, visiting, augsburg, he, was, impressed, by, stein, fortepianos, and, shared, this, in, a, letter, to, his, father, on, 22, october, 1777, mozart, had, premiered, his,

1783, when, living, in, vienna, he, purchased, an, instrument, by, walter, leopold, mozart, confirmed, the, attachment, which, mozart, had, with, his, walter, fortepiano, it, is, impossible, to, describe, the, hustle, and, bustle, your, brother, s, pianoforte, has, been, moved, at, least, twelve, times, from, his, house, to, the, theatre, or, to, someone, else, s, house, his, most, famous,

important, is, the, influence, mozart, had, on, composers, of, later, generations, ever, since, the, surge, in, his, reputation, after, his, death, studying, his, scores, has, been, a, standard, part, of, classical, musicians, training, ludwig, van, beethoven, mozart, s, junior, by, fifteen, years, was, deeply, influenced, by, his, work, with, which, he, was, acquainted, as, a, teenager, he, is, thought, to, have, performed, mozart, s, operas, while, playing, in, the, court, orchestra, at, bonn, and, travelled, to, vienna, in, 1787, hoping, to, study, with, the, older, composer, some, of,
