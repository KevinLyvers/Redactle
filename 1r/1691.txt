robert, burns, woodward, formemrs, honfrse, april, 10, 1917, july, 8, 1979, was, an, american, organic, chemist, he, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, preeminent, synthetic, organic, chemist, of, the, twentieth, century, having, made, many, key, contributions, to, the, subject, especially, in, the, synthesis, of, complex, natural, products, and, the, determination, of, their, molecular, structure, he, worked, closely, with, roald, hoffmann, on, theoretical, studies, of, chemical, reactions, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1965, woodward, was, born, in, boston, massachusetts, on, april, 10, 1917, he, was, the, son, of, margaret, burns, an, immigrant, from, scotland, who, claimed, to, be, a, descendant, of, the, poet, robert, burns, and, her, husband, arthur, chester, woodward, himself, the, son, of, roxbury, apothecary, harlow, elliot, woodward, his, father, was, one, of, the, many, victims, of, the, 1918, influenza, pandemic, from, a, very, early, age, woodward, was, attracted, to, and, engaged, in, private, study, of, chemistry, while, he, attended, a, public, primary, school, and, then, quincy, high, school, in, quincy, massachusetts, by, the, time, he, entered, high, school, he, had, already, managed, to, perform, most, of, the, experiments, in, ludwig, gattermann, s, then, widely, used, textbook, of, experimental, organic, chemistry, in, 1928, woodward, contacted, the, consul, general, of, the, german, consulate, in, boston, baron, von, tippelskirch, and, through, him, managed, to, obtain, copies, of, a, few, original, papers, published, in, german, journals, later, in, his, cope, lecture, he, recalled, how, he, had, been, fascinated, when, among, these, papers, he, chanced, upon, diels, and, alder, s, original, communication, about, the, diels, alder, reaction, throughout, his, career, woodward, was, to, repeatedly, and, powerfully, use, and, investigate, this, reaction, both, in, theoretical, and, experimental, ways, in, 1933, he, entered, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, but, neglected, his, formal, studies, badly, enough, to, be, excluded, at, the, end, of, the, 1934, fall, term, mit, readmitted, him, in, the, 1935, fall, term, and, by, 1936, he, had, received, the, bachelor, of, science, degree, only, one, year, later, mit, awarded, him, the, doctorate, when, his, classmates, were, still, graduating, with, their, bachelor, s, degrees, woodward, s, doctoral, work, involved, investigations, related, to, the, synthesis, of, the, female, sex, hormone, estrone, mit, required, that, graduate, students, have, research, advisors, woodward, s, advisors, were, james, flack, norris, and, avery, adrian, morton, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, he, actually, took, any, of, their, advice, after, a, short, postdoctoral, stint, at, the, university, of, illinois, he, took, a, junior, fellowship, at, harvard, university, from, 1937, to, 1938, and, remained, at, harvard, in, various, capacities, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, the, 1960s, woodward, was, named, donner, professor, of, science, a, title, that, freed, him, from, teaching, formal, courses, so, that, he, could, devote, his, entire, time, to, research, the, first, major, contribution, of, woodward, s, career, in, the, early, 1940s, was, a, series, of, papers, describing, the, application, of, ultraviolet, spectroscopy, in, the, elucidation, of, the, structure, of, natural, products, woodward, collected, together, a, large, amount, of, empirical, data, and, then, devised, a, series, of, rules, later, called, the, woodward, s, rules, which, could, be, applied, to, finding, out, the, structures, of, new, natural, substances, as, well, as, non, natural, synthesized, molecules, the, expedient, use, of, newly, developed, instrumental, techniques, was, a, characteristic, woodward, exemplified, throughout, his, career, and, it, marked, a, radical, change, from, the, extremely, tedious, and, long, chemical, methods, of, structural, elucidation, that, had, been, used, until, then, in, 1944, with, his, post, doctoral, researcher, william, von, eggers, doering, woodward, reported, the, synthesis, of, the, alkaloid, quinine, used, to, treat, malaria, although, the, synthesis, was, publicized, as, a, breakthrough, in, procuring, the, hard, to, get, medicinal, compound, from, japanese, occupied, southeast, asia, in, reality, it, was, too, long, and, tedious, to, adopt, on, a, practical, scale, nevertheless, it, was, a, landmark, for, chemical, synthesis, woodward, s, particular, insight, in, this, synthesis, was, to, realize, that, the, german, chemist, paul, rabe, had, converted, a, precursor, of, quinine, called, quinotoxine, to, quinine, in, 1905, hence, a, synthesis, of, quinotoxine, which, woodward, actually, synthesized, would, establish, a, route, to, synthesizing, quinine, when, woodward, accomplished, this, feat, organic, synthesis, was, still, largely, a, matter, of, trial, and, error, and, nobody, thought, that, such, complex, structures, could, actually, be, constructed, woodward, showed, that, organic, synthesis, could, be, made, into, a, rational, science, and, that, synthesis, could, be, aided, by, well, established, principles, of, reactivity, and, structure, this, synthesis, was, the, first, one, in, a, series, of, exceedingly, complicated, and, elegant, syntheses, that, he, would, undertake, culminating, in, the, 1930s, the, british, chemists, christopher, ingold, and, robert, robinson, among, others, had, investigated, the, mechanisms, of, organic, reactions, and, had, come, up, with, empirical, rules, which, could, predict, reactivity, of, organic, molecules, woodward, was, perhaps, the, first, synthetic, organic, chemist, who, used, these, ideas, as, a, predictive, framework, in, synthesis, woodward, s, style, was, the, inspiration, for, the, work, of, hundreds, of, successive, synthetic, chemists, who, synthesized, medicinally, important, and, structurally, complex, natural, products, during, the, late, 1940s, woodward, synthesized, many, complex, natural, products, including, quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic, acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and, colchicine, with, these, woodward, opened, up, a, new, era, of, synthesis, sometimes, called, the, woodwardian, era, in, which, he, showed, that, natural, products, could, be, synthesized, by, careful, applications, of, the, principles, of, physical, organic, chemistry, and, by, meticulous, planning, many, of, woodward, s, syntheses, were, described, as, spectacular, by, his, colleagues, and, before, he, did, them, it, was, thought, by, some, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, create, these, substances, in, the, lab, woodward, s, syntheses, were, also, described, as, having, an, element, of, art, in, them, and, since, then, synthetic, chemists, have, always, looked, for, elegance, as, well, as, utility, in, synthesis, his, work, also, involved, the, exhaustive, use, of, the, then, newly, developed, techniques, of, infrared, spectroscopy, and, later, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, another, important, feature, of, woodward, s, syntheses, was, their, attention, to, stereochemistry, or, the, particular, configuration, of, molecules, in, three, dimensional, space, most, natural, products, of, medicinal, importance, are, effective, for, example, as, drugs, only, when, they, possess, a, specific, stereochemistry, this, creates, the, demand, for, stereoselective, synthesis, producing, a, compound, with, a, defined, stereochemistry, while, today, a, typical, synthetic, route, routinely, involves, such, a, procedure, woodward, was, a, pioneer, in, showing, how, with, exhaustive, and, rational, planning, one, could, conduct, reactions, that, were, stereoselective, many, of, his, syntheses, involved, forcing, a, molecule, into, a, certain, configuration, by, installing, rigid, structural, elements, in, it, another, tactic, that, has, become, standard, today, in, this, regard, especially, his, syntheses, of, reserpine, and, strychnine, were, landmarks, during, world, war, ii, woodward, was, an, advisor, to, the, war, production, board, on, the, penicillin, project, although, often, given, credit, for, proposing, the, beta, lactam, structure, of, penicillin, it, was, actually, first, proposed, by, chemists, at, merck, and, edward, abraham, at, oxford, and, then, investigated, by, other, groups, as, well, e, g, shell, woodward, at, first, endorsed, an, incorrect, tricyclic, thiazolidine, fused, amino, bridged, oxazinone, structure, put, forth, by, the, penicillin, group, at, peoria, subsequently, he, put, his, imprimatur, on, the, beta, lactam, structure, all, of, this, in, opposition, to, the, thiazolidine, oxazolone, structure, proposed, by, robert, robinson, the, then, leading, organic, chemist, of, his, generation, ultimately, the, beta, lactam, structure, was, shown, to, be, correct, by, dorothy, hodgkin, using, x, ray, crystallography, in, 1945, woodward, also, applied, the, technique, of, infrared, spectroscopy, and, chemical, degradation, to, determine, the, structures, of, complicated, molecules, notable, among, these, structure, determinations, were, santonic, acid, strychnine, magnamycin, and, terramycin, in, each, one, of, these, cases, woodward, again, showed, how, rational, facts, and, chemical, principles, combined, with, chemical, intuition, could, be, used, to, achieve, the, task, in, the, early, 1950s, woodward, along, with, the, british, chemist, geoffrey, wilkinson, then, at, harvard, postulated, a, novel, structure, for, ferrocene, a, compound, consisting, of, a, combination, of, an, organic, molecule, with, iron, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, field, of, transition, metal, organometallic, chemistry, which, grew, into, an, industrially, very, significant, field, wilkinson, won, the, nobel, prize, for, this, work, in, 1973, along, with, ernst, otto, fischer, some, historians, think, that, woodward, should, have, shared, this, prize, along, with, wilkinson, remarkably, woodward, himself, thought, so, and, voiced, his, thoughts, in, a, letter, sent, to, the, nobel, committee, woodward, won, the, nobel, prize, in, 1965, for, his, synthesis, of, complex, organic, molecules, he, had, been, nominated, a, total, of, 111, times, from, 1946, to, 1965, in, his, nobel, lecture, he, described, the, total, synthesis, of, the, antibiotic, cephalosporin, and, claimed, that, he, had, pushed, the, synthesis, schedule, so, that, it, would, be, completed, around, the, time, of, the, nobel, ceremony, in, the, early, 1960s, woodward, began, work, on, what, was, the, most, complex, natural, product, synthesized, to, date, vitamin, b, 12, in, a, remarkable, collaboration, with, his, colleague, albert, eschenmoser, in, zurich, a, team, of, almost, one, hundred, students, and, postdoctoral, workers, worked, for, many, years, on, the, synthesis, of, this, molecule, the, work, was, finally, published, in, 1973, and, it, marked, a, landmark, in, the, history, of, organic, chemistry, the, synthesis, included, almost, a, hundred, steps, and, involved, the, characteristic, rigorous, planning, and, analyses, that, had, always, characterised, woodward, s, work, this, work, more, than, any, other, convinced, organic, chemists, that, the, synthesis, of, any, complex, substance, was, possible, given, enough, time, and, planning, see, also, palytoxin, synthesized, by, the, research, group, of, yoshito, kishi, one, of, woodward, s, postdoctoral, students, as, of, 2019, no, other, total, synthesis, of, vitamin, b, 12, has, been, published, that, same, year, based, on, observations, that, woodward, had, made, during, the, b, 12, synthesis, he, and, roald, hoffmann, devised, rules, now, called, the, woodward, hoffmann, rules, for, elucidating, the, stereochemistry, of, the, products, of, organic, reactions, woodward, formulated, his, ideas, which, were, based, on, the, symmetry, properties, of, molecular, orbitals, based, on, his, experiences, as, a, synthetic, organic, chemist, he, asked, hoffman, to, perform, theoretical, calculations, to, verify, these, ideas, which, were, done, using, hoffmann, s, extended, h, ckel, method, the, predictions, of, these, rules, called, the, woodward, hoffmann, rules, were, verified, by, many, experiments, hoffmann, shared, the, 1981, nobel, prize, for, this, work, along, with, kenichi, fukui, a, japanese, chemist, who, had, done, similar, work, using, a, different, approach, woodward, had, died, in, 1979, and, nobel, prizes, are, not, awarded, posthumously, while, at, harvard, woodward, took, on, the, directorship, of, the, woodward, research, institute, based, at, basel, switzerland, in, 1963, he, also, became, a, trustee, of, his, alma, mater, mit, from, 1966, to, 1971, and, of, the, weizmann, institute, of, science, in, israel, woodward, died, in, cambridge, massachusetts, from, a, heart, attack, in, his, sleep, at, the, time, he, was, working, on, the, synthesis, of, an, antibiotic, erythromycin, a, student, of, his, said, about, him, during, his, lifetime, woodward, authored, or, coauthored, almost, 200, publications, of, which, 85, are, full, papers, the, remainder, comprising, preliminary, communications, the, text, of, lectures, and, reviews, the, pace, of, his, scientific, activity, soon, outstripped, his, capacity, to, publish, all, experimental, details, and, much, of, the, work, in, which, he, participated, was, not, published, until, a, few, years, after, his, death, woodward, trained, more, than, two, hundred, ph, d, students, and, postdoctoral, workers, many, of, whom, later, went, on, to, distinguished, careers, some, of, his, best, known, students, include, robert, m, williams, colorado, state, harry, wasserman, yale, yoshito, kishi, harvard, stuart, schreiber, harvard, william, r, roush, scripps, florida, steven, a, benner, uf, james, d, wuest, montreal, christopher, s, foote, ucla, kendall, houk, ucla, porphyrin, chemist, kevin, m, smith, lsu, thomas, r, hoye, university, of, minnesota, ronald, breslow, columbia, university, and, david, dolphin, ubc, woodward, had, an, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, chemistry, and, an, extraordinary, memory, for, detail, probably, the, quality, that, most, set, him, apart, from, his, peers, was, his, remarkable, ability, to, tie, together, disparate, threads, of, knowledge, from, the, chemical, literature, and, bring, them, to, bear, on, a, chemical, problem, for, his, work, woodward, received, many, awards, honors, and, honorary, doctorates, including, election, to, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1948, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1953, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1962, and, membership, in, academies, around, the, world, he, was, also, a, consultant, to, many, companies, such, as, polaroid, pfizer, and, merck, other, awards, include, woodward, also, received, over, twenty, honorary, degrees, including, honorary, doctorates, from, the, following, universities, in, 1938, he, married, irja, pullman, they, had, two, daughters, siiri, anna, b, 1939, and, jean, kirsten, b, 1944, in, 1946, he, married, eudoxia, muller, an, artist, and, technician, whom, he, met, at, the, polaroid, corp, this, marriage, which, lasted, until, 1972, produced, a, daughter, and, a, son, crystal, elisabeth, b, 1947, and, eric, richard, arthur, b, 1953, his, lectures, frequently, lasted, for, three, or, four, hours, his, longest, known, lecture, defined, the, unit, of, time, known, as, the, woodward, after, which, his, other, lectures, were, deemed, to, be, so, many, milli, woodwards, long, in, many, of, these, he, eschewed, the, use, of, slides, and, drew, structures, by, using, multicolored, chalk, typically, to, begin, a, lecture, woodward, would, arrive, and, lay, out, two, large, white, handkerchiefs, on, the, countertop, upon, one, would, be, four, or, five, colors, of, chalk, new, pieces, neatly, sorted, by, color, in, a, long, row, upon, the, other, handkerchief, would, be, placed, an, equally, impressive, row, of, cigarettes, the, previous, cigarette, would, be, used, to, light, the, next, one, his, thursday, seminars, at, harvard, often, lasted, well, into, the, night, he, had, a, fixation, with, blue, and, many, of, his, suits, his, car, and, even, his, parking, space, were, coloured, in, blue, in, one, of, his, laboratories, his, students, hung, a, large, black, and, white, photograph, of, the, master, from, the, ceiling, complete, with, a, large, blue, tie, appended, there, it, hung, for, some, years, early, 1970s, until, scorched, in, a, minor, laboratory, fire, he, detested, exercise, could, get, along, with, only, a, few, hours, of, sleep, every, night, was, a, heavy, smoker, and, enjoyed, scotch, whisky, and, martinis
