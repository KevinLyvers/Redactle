that, the, british, would, retreat, from, india, as, they, had, from, singapore, and, burma, patel, urged, that, the, campaign, start, without, any, delay, though, feeling, that, the, british, would,

india, before, the, japanese, can, come, and, be, ready, to, fight, them, if, they, come, they, will, round, up, the, leaders, round, up, all, then, it, will, be, the, duty, of, every, indian, to, put, forth, his, utmost, effort, within, non, violence, no, source, is, to, be, left, untapped, no, weapon, untried, this, is, going, to, be, the, opportunity, of, a, lifetime, historians, believe, that, patel, s, speech, was, instrumental, in, electrifying, nationalists, who, up, to, then, had, been, sceptical, of, the, proposed, rebellion, patel, s, organising, work, in, this, period, is, credited, by, historians, with, ensuring, the, success, of, the, rebellion, across, india, patel, was, arrested, on, 9, august, and, was, imprisoned, with, the, entire, congress, working, committee, from, 1942, to, 1945, at, the, fort, in, ahmednagar, here, he, spun, cloth, played, bridge, read, a, large, number, of, books, took, long, walks, and, practised, gardening, he, also, provided, emotional, support, to, his, colleagues, while, awaiting, news, and, developments, from, the, outside, patel, was, deeply, pained, at, the, news, of, the, deaths, of, mahadev, desai, and, kasturba, gandhi, later, that, year, but, patel, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, daughter, that, he, and, his, colleagues, were, experiencing, fullest, peace, for, having, done, their, duty, even, though, other, political, parties, had, opposed, the, struggle, and, the, british, colonial, government, had, responded, by, imprisoning, most, of, the, leaders, of, congress, the, quit, india, movement, was, by, far, the, most, serious, rebellion, since, that, of, 1857, as, the, viceroy, cabled, to, winston, churchill, more, than, 100, 000, people, were, arrested, and, numerous, protestors, were, killed, in, violent, confrontations, with, the, indian, imperial, police, strikes, protests, and, other, revolutionary, activities, had, broken, out, across, india, when, patel, was, released, on, 15, june, 1945, he, realised, that, the, british, government, was, preparing, proposals, to, transfer, power, to, india, in, the, 1946, indian, provincial, elections, the, congress, won, a, large, majority, of, the, elected, seats, dominating, the, hindu, electorate, however, the, muslim, league, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, won, a, large, majority, of, muslim, electorate, seats, the, league, had, resolved, in, 1940, to, demand, pakistan, an, independent, state, for, muslims, and, was, a, fierce, critic, of, the, congress, the, congress, formed, governments, in, all, provinces, save, sindh, punjab, and, bengal, where, it, entered, into, coalitions, with, other, parties, when, the, british, mission, proposed, two, plans, for, transfer, of, power, there, was, considerable, opposition, within, the, congress, to, both, the, plan, of, 16, may, 1946, proposed, a, loose, federation, with, extensive, provincial, autonomy, and, the, grouping, of, provinces, based, on, religious, majority, the, plan, of, 16, may, 1946, proposed, the, partition, of, india, on, religious, lines, with, over, 565, princely, states, free, to, choose, between, independence, or, accession, to, either, dominion, the, league, approved, both, plans, while, the, congress, flatly, rejected, the, proposal, of, 16, may, gandhi, criticised, the, 16, may, proposal, as, being, inherently, divisive, but, patel, realising, that, rejecting, the, proposal, would, mean, that, only, the, league, would, be, invited, to, form, a, government, lobbied, the, congress, working, committee, hard, to, give, its, assent, to, the, 16, may, proposal, patel, engaged, in, discussions, with, the, british, envoys, sir, stafford, cripps, and, lord, pethick, lawrence, and, obtained, an, assurance, that, the, grouping, clause, would, not, be, given, practical, force, patel, converted, jawaharlal, nehru, rajendra, prasad, and, rajagopalachari, to, accept, the, plan, when, the, league, retracted, its, approval, of, the, 16, may, plan, the, viceroy, lord, wavell, invited, the, congress, to, form, the, government, under, nehru, who, was, styled, the, vice, president, of, the, viceroy, s, executive, council, patel, took, charge, of, the, departments, of, home, affairs, and, information, and, broadcasting, he, moved, into, a, government, house, on, aurangzeb, road, in, delhi, which, would, be, his, home, until, his, death, in, 1950, vallabhbhai, patel, was, one, of, the, first, congress, leaders, to, accept, the, partition, of, india, as, a, solution, to, the, rising, muslim, separatist, movement, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, he, had, been, outraged, by, jinnah, s, direct, action, campaign, which, had, provoked, communal, violence, across, india, and, by, the, viceroy, s, vetoes, of, his, home, department, s, plans, to, stop, the, violence, on, the, grounds, of, constitutionality, patel, severely, criticised, the, viceroy, s, induction, of, league, ministers, into, the, government, and, the, revalidation, of, the, grouping, scheme, by, the, british, government, without, congress, s, approval, although, further, outraged, at, the, league, s, boycott, of, the, assembly, and, non, acceptance, of, the, plan, of, 16, may, despite, entering, government, he, was, also, aware, that, jinnah, did, enjoy, popular, support, amongst, muslims, and, that, an, open, conflict, between, him, and, the, nationalists, could, degenerate, into, a, hindu, muslim, civil, war, of, disastrous, consequences, the, continuation, of, a, divided, and, weak, central, government, would, in, patel, s, mind, result, in, the, wider, fragmentation, of, india, by, encouraging, more, than, 600, princely, states, towards, independence, in, december, 1946, and, january, 1947, patel, worked, with, civil, servant, v, p, menon, on, the, latter, s, suggestion, for, a, separate, dominion, of, pakistan, created, out, of, muslim, majority, provinces, communal, violence, in, bengal, and, punjab, in, january, and, march, 1947, further, convinced, patel, of, the, soundness, of, partition, patel, a, fierce, critic, of, jinnah, s, demand, that, the, hindu, majority, areas, of, punjab, and, bengal, be, included, in, a, muslim, state, obtained, the, partition, of, those, provinces, thus, blocking, any, possibility, of, their, inclusion, in, pakistan, patel, s, decisiveness, on, the, partition, of, punjab, and, bengal, had, won, him, many, supporters, and, admirers, amongst, the, indian, public, which, had, tired, of, the, league, s, tactics, but, he, was, criticised, by, gandhi, nehru, secular, muslims, and, socialists, for, a, perceived, eagerness, to, do, so, when, lord, louis, mountbatten, formally, proposed, the, plan, on, 3, june, 1947, patel, gave, his, approval, and, lobbied, nehru, and, other, congress, leaders, to, accept, the, proposal, knowing, gandhi, s, deep, anguish, regarding, proposals, of, partition, patel, engaged, him, in, frank, discussion, in, private, meetings, over, what, he, saw, as, the, practical, unworkability, of, any, congress, league, coalition, the, rising, violence, and, the, threat, of, civil, war, at, the, all, india, congress, committee, meeting, called, to, vote, on, the, proposal, patel, said, i, fully, appreciate, the, fears, of, our, brothers, from, nobody, likes, the, division, of, india, and, my, heart, is, heavy, but, the, choice, is, between, one, division, and, many, divisions, we, must, face, facts, we, cannot, give, way, to, emotionalism, and, sentimentality, the, working, committee, has, not, acted, out, of, fear, but, i, am, afraid, of, one, thing, that, all, our, toil, and, hard, work, of, these, many, years, might, go, waste, or, prove, unfruitful, my, nine, months, in, office, has, completely, disillusioned, me, regarding, the, supposed, merits, of, the, cabinet, mission, plan, except, for, a, few, honourable, exceptions, muslim, officials, from, the, top, down, to, the, chaprasis, peons, or, servants, are, working, for, the, league, the, communal, veto, given, to, the, league, in, the, mission, plan, would, have, blocked, india, s, progress, at, every, stage, whether, we, like, it, or, not, de, facto, pakistan, already, exists, in, the, punjab, and, bengal, under, the, circumstances, i, would, prefer, a, de, jure, pakistan, which, may, make, the, league, more, responsible, freedom, is, coming, we, have, 75, to, 80, percent, of, india, which, we, can, make, strong, with, our, own, genius, the, league, can, develop, the, rest, of, the, country, after, gandhi, rejected, and, congress, approved, the, plan, patel, represented, india, on, the, partition, council, where, he, oversaw, the, division, of, public, assets, and, selected, the, indian, council, of, ministers, with, nehru, however, neither, patel, nor, any, other, indian, leader, had, foreseen, the, intense, violence, and, population, transfer, that, would, take, place, with, partition, patel, took, the, lead, in, organising, relief, and, emergency, supplies, establishing, refugee, camps, and, visiting, the, border, areas, with, pakistani, leaders, to, encourage, peace, despite, these, efforts, the, death, toll, is, estimated, at, between, 500, 000, and, 1, million, people, the, estimated, number, of, refugees, in, both, countries, exceeds, 15, million, understanding, that, delhi, and, punjab, policemen, accused, of, organising, attacks, on, muslims, were, personally, affected, by, the, tragedies, of, partition, patel, called, out, the, indian, army, with, south, indian, regiments, to, restore, order, imposing, strict, curfews, and, shoot, on, sight, orders, visiting, the, nizamuddin, auliya, dargah, area, in, delhi, where, thousands, of, delhi, muslims, feared, attacks, he, prayed, at, the, shrine, visited, the, people, and, reinforced, the, presence, of, police, he, suppressed, from, the, press, reports, of, atrocities, in, pakistan, against, hindus, and, sikhs, to, prevent, retaliatory, violence, establishing, the, delhi, emergency, committee, to, restore, order, and, organising, relief, efforts, for, refugees, in, the, capital, patel, publicly, warned, officials, against, partiality, and, neglect, when, reports, reached, patel, that, large, groups, of, sikhs, were, preparing, to, attack, muslim, convoys, heading, for, pakistan, patel, hurried, to, amritsar, and, met, sikh, and, hindu, leaders, arguing, that, attacking, helpless, people, was, cowardly, and, dishonourable, patel, emphasised, that, sikh, actions, would, result, in, further, attacks, against, hindus, and, sikhs, in, pakistan, he, assured, the, community, leaders, that, if, they, worked, to, establish, peace, and, order, and, guarantee, the, safety, of, muslims, the, indian, government, would, react, forcefully, to, any, failures, of, pakistan, to, do, the, same, additionally, patel, addressed, a, massive, crowd, of, approximately, 200, 000, refugees, who, had, surrounded, his, car, after, the, meetings, here, in, this, same, city, the, blood, of, hindus, sikhs, and, muslims, mingled, in, the, bloodbath, of, jallianwala, bagh, i, am, grieved, to, think, that, things, have, come, to, such, a, pass, that, no, muslim, can, go, about, in, amritsar, and, no, hindu, or, sikh, can, even, think, of, living, in, lahore, the, butchery, of, innocent, and, defenceless, men, women, and, children, does, not, behove, brave, men, i, am, quite, certain, that, india, s, interest, lies, in, getting, all, her, men, and, women, across, the, border, and, sending, out, all, muslims, from, east, punjab, i, have, come, to, you, with, a, specific, appeal, pledge, the, safety, of, muslim, refugees, crossing, the, city, any, obstacles, or, hindrances, will, only, worsen, the, plight, of, our, refugees, who, are, already, performing, prodigious, feats, of, endurance, if, we, have, to, fight, we, must, fight, clean, such, a, fight, must, await, an, appropriate, time, and, conditions, and, you, must, be, watchful, in, choosing, your, ground, to, fight, against, the, refugees, is, no, fight, at, all, no, laws, of, humanity, or, war, among, honourable, men, permit, the, murder, of, people, who, have, sought, shelter, and, protection, let, there, be, truce, for, three, months, in, which, both, sides, can, exchange, their, refugees, this, sort, of, truce, is, permitted, even, by, laws, of, war, let, us, take, the, initiative, in, breaking, this, vicious, circle, of, attacks, and, counter, attacks, hold, your, hands, for, a, week, and, see, what, happens, make, way, for, the, refugees, with, your, own, force, of, volunteers, and, let, them, deliver, the, refugees, safely, at, our, frontier, following, his, dialogue, with, community, leaders, and, his, speech, no, further, attacks, occurred, against, muslim, refugees, and, a, wider, peace, and, order, was, soon, re, established, over, the, entire, area, however, patel, was, criticised, by, nehru, secular, muslims, and, gandhi, over, his, alleged, wish, to, see, muslims, from, other, parts, of, india, depart, while, patel, vehemently, denied, such, allegations, the, acrimony, with, maulana, azad, and, other, secular, muslim, leaders, increased, when, patel, refused, to, dismiss, delhi, s, sikh, police, commissioner, who, was, accused, of, discrimination, hindu, and, sikh, leaders, also, accused, patel, and, other, leaders, of, not, taking, pakistan, sufficiently, to, task, over, the, attacks, on, their, communities, there, and, muslim, leaders, further, criticised, him, for, allegedly, neglecting, the, needs, of, muslims, leaving, for, pakistan, and, concentrating, resources, for, incoming, hindu, and, sikh, refugees, patel, clashed, with, nehru, and, azad, over, the, allocation, of, houses, in, delhi, vacated, by, muslims, leaving, for, pakistan, nehru, and, azad, desired, to, allocate, them, for, displaced, muslims, while, patel, argued, that, no, government, professing, secularism, must, make, such, exclusions, however, patel, was, publicly, defended, by, gandhi, and, received, widespread, admiration, and, support, for, speaking, frankly, on, communal, issues, and, acting, decisively, and, resourcefully, to, quell, disorder, and, violence, as, the, first, home, minister, patel, played, one, of, the, major, role, in, the, integration, of, the, princely, states, into, the, indian, federation, this, achievement, formed, the, cornerstone, of, patel, s, popularity, in, the, post, independence, era, he, is, in, this, regard, compared, to, otto, von, bismarck, who, unified, the, many, german, states, in, 1871, under, the, plan, of, 3, june, more, than, 565, princely, states, were, given, the, option, of, joining, either, india, or, pakistan, or, choosing, independence, indian, nationalists, and, large, segments, of, the, public, feared, that, if, these, states, did, not, accede, most, of, the, people, and, territory, would, be, fragmented, the, congress, as, well, as, senior, british, officials, considered, patel, the, best, man, for, the, task, of, achieving, conquest, of, the, princely, states, by, the, indian, dominion, gandhi, had, said, to, patel, the, problem, of, the, states, is, so, difficult, that, you, alone, can, solve, it, patel, was, considered, a, statesman, of, integrity, with, the, practical, acumen, and, resolve, to, accomplish, a, monumental, task, he, asked, v, p, menon, a, senior, civil, servant, with, whom, he, had, worked, on, the, partition, of, india, to, become, his, right, hand, man, as, chief, secretary, of, the, states, ministry, on, 6, august, 1947, patel, began, lobbying, the, princes, attempting, to, make, them, receptive, towards, dialogue, with, the, future, government, and, forestall, potential, conflicts, patel, used, social, meetings, and, unofficial, surroundings, to, engage, most, of, the, monarchs, inviting, them, to, lunch, and, tea, at, his, home, in, delhi, at, these, meetings, patel, explained, that, there, was, no, inherent, conflict, between, the, congress, and, the, princely, order, patel, invoked, the, patriotism, of, india, s, monarchs, asking, them, to, join, in, the, independence, of, their, nation, and, act, as, responsible, rulers, who, cared, about, the, future, of, their, people, he, persuaded, the, princes, of, 565, states, of, the, impossibility, of, independence, from, the, indian, republic, especially, in, the, presence, of, growing, opposition, from, their, subjects, he, proposed, favourable, terms, for, the, merger, including, the, creation, of, privy, purses, for, the, rulers, descendants, while, encouraging, the, rulers, to, act, out, of, patriotism, patel, did, not, rule, out, force, stressing, that, the, princes, would, need, to, accede, to, india, in, good, faith, he, set, a, deadline, of, 15, august, 1947, for, them, to, sign, the, instrument, of, accession, document, all, but, three, of, the, states, willingly, merged, into, the, indian, union, only, jammu, and, kashmir, junagadh, and, hyderabad, did, not, fall, into, his, basket, junagadh, was, especially, important, to, patel, since, it, was, in, his, home, state, of, gujarat, it, was, also, important, because, in, this, kathiawar, district, was, the, ultra, rich, somnath, temple, which, in, the, 11th, century, had, been, plundered, by, mahmud, of, ghazni, who, damaged, the, temple, and, its, idols, to, rob, it, of, its, riches, including, emeralds, diamonds, and, gold, under, pressure, from, sir, shah, nawaz, bhutto, the, nawab, had, acceded, to, pakistan, it, was, however, quite, far, from, pakistan, and, 80, of, its, population, was, hindu, patel, combined, diplomacy, with, force, demanding, that, pakistan, annul, the, accession, and, that, the, nawab, accede, to, india, he, sent, the, army, to, occupy, three, principalities, of, junagadh, to, show, his, resolve, following, widespread, protests, and, the, formation, of, a, civil, government, or, aarzi, hukumat, both, bhutto, and, the, nawab, fled, to, karachi, and, under, patel, s, orders, the, indian, army, and, police, units, marched, into, the, state, a, plebiscite, organised, later, produced, a, 99, 5, vote, for, merger, with, india, in, a, speech, at, the, bahauddin, college, in, junagadh, following, the, latter, s, take, over, patel, emphasised, his, feeling, of, urgency, on, hyderabad, which, he, felt, was, more, vital, to, india, than, kashmir, if, hyderabad, does, not, see, the, writing, on, the, wall, it, goes, the, way, junagadh, has, gone, pakistan, attempted, to, set, off, kashmir, against, junagadh, when, we, raised, the, question, of, settlement, in, a, democratic, way, they, pakistan, at, once, told, us, that, they, would, consider, it, if, we, applied, that, policy, to, kashmir, our, reply, was, that, we, would, agree, to, kashmir, if, they, agreed, to, hyderabad, hyderabad, was, the, largest, of, the, princely, states, and, it, included, parts, of, present, day, telangana, andhra, pradesh, karnataka, and, maharashtra, states, its, ruler, the, nizam, osman, ali, khan, was, a, muslim, although, over, 80, of, its, people, were, hindu, the, nizam, sought, independence, or, accession, with, pakistan, muslim, forces, loyal, to, nizam, called, the, razakars, under, qasim, razvi, pressed, the, nizam, to, hold, out, against, india, while, organising, attacks, on, people, on, indian, soil, even, though, a, standstill, agreement, was, signed, due, to, the, desperate, efforts, of, lord, mountbatten, to, avoid, a, war, the, nizam, rejected, deals, and, changed, his, positions, on, september, 7, jawaharlal, nehru, gave, ultimatum, to, nizam, demanding, ban, on, the, razakars, and, return, of, indian, troops, to, secunderabad, pakistan, foreign, minister, muhammad, zafarullah, khan, warned, india, against, this, ultimatum, the, invasion, of, hyderabad, was, then, launched, on, 13, september, after, the, death, of, jinnah, on, 11, september, after, the, defeat, of, razakars, the, nizam, signed, an, instrument, of, accession, joining, india, the, governor, general, of, india, chakravarti,

enjoyed, the, loyalty, and, the, faith, of, rank, and, file, congressmen, state, leaders, and, india, s, civil, servants, patel, was, a, senior, leader, in, the, constituent, assembly, of, india, and, was, responsible, in, large, measure, for, shaping, india, s, constitution, patel, was, the, chairman, of, the, committees, responsible, for, minorities, tribal, and, excluded, areas, fundamental, rights, and, provincial, constitutions, patel, piloted, a, model, constitution, for, the, provinces, in, the, assembly, which, contained, limited, powers, for, the, state, governor, who, would, defer, to, the, president, he, clarified, it, was, not, the, intention, to, let, the, governor, exercise, power, that, could, impede, an, elected, government, he, worked, closely, with, muslim, leaders, to, end, separate, electorates, and, the, more, potent, demand, for, reservation, of, seats, for, minorities, his, intervention, was, key, to, the, passage, of, two, articles, that, protected, civil, servants, from, political, involvement, and, guaranteed, their, terms, and, privileges, he, was, also, instrumental, in, the, founding, the, indian, administrative, service, and, the, indian, police, service, and, for, his, defence, of, indian, civil, servants, from, political, attack, he, is, known, as, the, patron, saint, of, india, s, services, when, a, delegation, of, gujarati, farmers, came, to, him, citing, their, inability, to, send, their, milk, production, to, the, markets, without, being, fleeced, by, intermediaries, patel, exhorted, them, to, organise, the, processing, and, sale, of, milk, by, themselves, and, guided, them, to, create, the, kaira, district, co, operative, milk, producers, union, limited, which, preceded, the, amul, milk, products, brand, patel, also, pledged, the, reconstruction, of, the, ancient, but, dilapidated, somnath, temple, in, saurashtra, he, oversaw, the, restoration, work, and, the, creation, of, a, public, trust, and, pledged, to, dedicate, the, temple, upon, the, completion, of, work, the, work, was, completed, after, his, death, and, the, temple, was, inaugurated, by, the, first, president, of, india, dr, rajendra, prasad, when, the, pakistani, invasion, of, kashmir, began, in, september, 1947, patel, immediately, wanted, to, send, troops, into, kashmir, but, agreeing, with, nehru, and, mountbatten, he, waited, until, kashmir, s,

and, for, a, major, military, road, connecting, srinagar, to, pathankot, to, be, built, in, six, months, patel, strongly, advised, nehru, against, going, for, arbitration, to, the, united, nations, insisting, that, pakistan, had, been, wrong, to, support, the, invasion, and, the, accession, to, india, was, valid, he, did, not, want, foreign, interference, in, a, bilateral, affair, patel, opposed, the, release, of, rs, 550, million, to, the, government, of, pakistan, convinced, that, the, money, would, go, to, finance, the, war, against, india, in, kashmir, the, cabinet, had, approved, his, point, but, it, was, reversed, when, gandhi, who, feared, an, intensifying, rivalry, and, further, communal, violence, went, on, a, fast, unto, death, to, obtain, the, release, patel, though, not, estranged, from, gandhi, was, deeply, hurt, at, the, rejection, of, his, counsel, and, a, cabinet, decision, in, 1949, a, crisis, arose, when, the, number, of, hindu, refugees, entering, west, bengal, assam, and, tripura, from, east, pakistan, climbed, to, over, 800, 000, the, refugees, in, many, cases, were, being, forcibly, evicted, by, pakistani, authorities, and, were, victims, of,

the, matter, patel, strongly, criticised, nehru, s, plan, to, sign, a, pact, that, would, create, minority, commissions, in, both, countries, and, pledge, both, india, and, pakistan, to, a, commitment, to, protect, each, other, s, minorities, syama, prasad, mookerjee, and, k, c, neogy, two, bengali, ministers, resigned, and, nehru, was, intensely, criticised, in, west, bengal, for,

his, home, ministry, s, officials, nehru, was, offended, by, patel, s, decision, making, regarding, the, states, integration, having, consulted, neither, him, nor, the, cabinet, patel, asked, gandhi, to, relieve, him, of, his, obligation, to, serve, believing, that, an, open, political, battle, would, hurt, india, after, much, personal, deliberation, and, contrary, to, patel, s, prediction, gandhi, on, 30, january, 1948, told, patel, not, to, leave, the, government, a, free, india, according, to, gandhi, needed, both, patel, and, nehru, patel, was, the, last, man, to, privately, talk,

offering, to, leave, the, government, patel, s, secretary, persuaded, him, to, withhold, the, letter, seeing, it, as, fodder, for, patel, s, political, enemies, and, political, conflict, in, india,

hand, in, integrating, the, princely, states, into, india, though, the, two, committed, themselves, to, joint, leadership, and, non, interference, in, congress, party, affairs, they, sometimes, would,

to, tibet, after, its, 1950, invasion, by, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, on, ejecting, the, portuguese, from, goa, by, military, force, when, nehru, pressured, rajendra, prasad, to, decline, a, nomination, to, become, the, first, president, of, india, in, 1950, in, favour, of, rajagopalachari, he, angered, the, party, which, felt, nehru, was, attempting, to, impose, his, will,

tandon, a, conservative, hindu, leader, endorsing, jivatram, kripalani, instead, and, threatening, to, resign, if, tandon, was, elected, patel, rejected, nehru, s, views, and, endorsed, tandon, in, gujarat, where, kripalani, received, not, one, vote, despite, hailing, from, that, state, himself, patel, believed, nehru, had, to, understand, that, his, will, was, not, law, with, the, congress,
