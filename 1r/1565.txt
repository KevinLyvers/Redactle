affected, by, apartheid, he, believed, that, well, intentioned, white, liberals, failed, to, comprehend, the, black, experience, and, often, acted, in, a, paternalistic, manner, he, developed, the, view, that, to, avoid, white, domination, black, people, had, to, organise, independently, and, to, this, end, he, became, a, leading, figure, in, the, creation, of, the, south, african, students,

people, biko, believed, that, black, people, needed, to, rid, themselves, of, any, sense, of, racial, inferiority, an, idea, he, expressed, by, popularizing, the, slogan, black, is, beautiful, in, 1972, he, was, involved, in, founding, the, black, people, s, convention, bpc, to, promote, black, consciousness, ideas, among, the, wider, population, the, government, came, to, see, biko, as, a, subversive, threat, and, placed, him, under, a, banning, order, in, 1973, severely, restricting, his, activities, he, remained, politically, active, helping, organise, bcps, such, as, a, healthcare,

government, alleged, that, he, hated, whites, various, anti, apartheid, activists, accused, him, of, sexism, and, african, racial, nationalists, criticised, his, united, front, with, coloureds, and, indians, nonetheless, biko, became, one, of, the, earliest, icons, of, the, movement, against, apartheid, and, is, regarded, as, a, political, martyr, and, the, father, of, black, consciousness, his,

cook, at, grey, hospital, in, king, william, s, town, according, to, his, sister, it, was, this, observation, of, his, mother, s, difficult, working, conditions, that, resulted, in, biko, s, earliest, politicisation, biko, s, given, name, bantu, means, people, in, isixhosa, biko, interpreted, this, in, terms, of, the, saying, umntu, ngumntu, ngabantu, a, person, is, a, person, by, means, of, other,

banned, both, khaya, and, steve, were, arrested, and, interrogated, by, the, police, the, former, was, convicted, then, acquitted, on, appeal, no, clear, evidence, of, steve, s, connection, to, poqo, was, presented, but, he, was, expelled, from, lovedale, commenting, later, on, this, situation, he, stated, i, began, to, develop, an, attitude, which, was, much, more, directed, at, authority, than, at, anything, else, i, hated, authority, like, hell, from, 1964, to, 1965, biko, studied, at, st, francis, college, a, catholic, boarding, school, in, mariannhill, natal, the, college, had, a, liberal, political, culture, and, biko, developed, his, political, consciousness, there, he, became, particularly, interested, in, the, replacement, of, south, africa, s, white, minority, government, with, an, administration, that, represented, the, country, s, black, majority, among, the, anti, colonialist, leaders, who, became, biko, s, heroes, at, this, time, were, algeria, s, ahmed, ben, bella, and, kenya, s, jaramogi, oginga, odinga, he, later, said, that, most, of, the, politicos, in, his, family, were, sympathetic, to, the, pac, which, had, anti, communist, and, african, racialist, ideas, biko, admired, what, he, described, as, the, pac, s, terribly, good, organisation, and, the, courage, of, many, of, its, members, but, he, remained, unconvinced, by, its, racially, exclusionary, approach, believing, that, members, of, all, racial, groups, should, unite, against, the, government, in, december, 1964, he, travelled, to, zwelitsha, for, the, ulwaluko, circumcision, ceremony, symbolically, marking, his, transition, from, boyhood, to, manhood, biko, was, initially, interested, in, studying, law, at, university, but, many, of, those, around, him, discouraged, this, believing, that, law, was, too, closely, intertwined, with, political, activism, instead, they, convinced, him, to, choose, medicine, a, subject, thought, to, have, better, career, prospects, he, secured, a, scholarship, and, in, 1966, entered, the, university, of, natal, medical, school, there, he, joined, what, his, biographer, xolela, mangcu, called, a, peculiarly, sophisticated, and, cosmopolitan, group, of, students, from, across, south, africa, many, of, them, later, held, prominent, roles, in, the, post, apartheid, era, the, late, 1960s, was, the, heyday, of, radical, student, politics, across, the, world, as, reflected, in, the, protests, of, 1968, and, biko, was, eager, to, involve, himself, in, this, environment, soon, after, he, arrived, at, the, university, he, was, elected, to, the, students, representative, council, src, the, university, s, src, was, affiliated, with, the, national, union, of, south, african, students, nusas, nusas, had, taken, pains, to, cultivate, a, multi, racial, membership, but, remained, white, dominated, because, the, majority, of, south, africa, s, students, were, from, the, country, s, white, minority, as, clive, nettleton, a, white, nusas, leader, put, it, the, essence, of, the, matter, is, that, nusas, was, founded, on, white, initiative, is, financed, by, white, money, and, reflects, the, opinions, of, the, majority, of, its, members, who, are, white, nusas, officially, opposed, apartheid, but, it, moderated, its, opposition, in, order, to, maintain, the, support, of, conservative, white, students, biko, and, several, other, black, african, nusas, members, were, frustrated, when, it, organised, parties, in, white, dormitories, which, black, africans, were, forbidden, to, enter, in, july, 1967, a, nusas, conference, was, held, at, rhodes, university, in, grahamstown, after, the, students, arrived, they, found, that, dormitory, accommodation, had, been, arranged, for, the, white, and, indian, delegates, but, not, the, black, africans, who, were, told, that, they, could, sleep, in, a, local, church, biko, and, other, black, african, delegates, walked, out, of, the, conference, in, anger, biko, later, related, that, this, event, forced, him, to, rethink, his, belief, in, the, multi, racial, approach, to, political, activism, i, realized, that, for, a, long, time, i, had, been, holding, onto, this, whole, dogma, of, nonracism, almost, like, a, religion, but, in, the, course, of, that, debate, i, began, to, feel, there, was, a, lot, lacking, in, the, proponents, of, the, nonracist, idea, they, had, this, problem, you, know, of, superiority, and, they, tended, to, take, us, for, granted, and, wanted, us, to, accept, things, that, were, second, class, they, could, not, see, why, we, could, not, consider, staying, in, that, church, and, i, began, to, feel, that, our, understanding, of, our, own, situation, in, this, country, was, not, coincidental, with, that, of, these, liberal, whites, following, the, 1968, nusas, conference, in, johannesburg, many, of, its, members, attended, a, july, 1968, conference, of, the, university, christian, movement, at, stutterheim, there, the, black, african, members, decided, to, hold, a, december, conference, to, discuss, the, formation, of, an, independent, black, student, group, the, south, african, students, organisation, saso, was, officially, launched, at, a, july, 1969, conference, at, the, university, of, the, north, there, the, group, s, constitution, and, basic, policy, platform, were, adopted, the, group, s, focus, was, on, the, need, for, contact, between, centres, of, black, student, activity, including, through, sport, cultural, activities, and, debating, competitions, though, biko, played, a, substantial, role, in, saso, s, creation, he, sought, a, low, public, profile, during, its, early, stages, believing, that, this, would, strengthen, its, second, level, of, leadership, such, as, his, ally, barney, pityana, nonetheless, he, was, elected, as, saso, s, first, president, pat, matshaka, was, elected, vice, president, and, wuila, mashalaba, elected, secretary, durban, became, its, de, facto, headquarters, like, black, power, in, the, united, states, south, africa, s, black, consciousness, movement, was, grounded, in, the, belief, that, african, descendant, peoples, had, to, overcome, the, enormous, psychological, and, cultural, damage, imposed, on, them, by, a, succession, of, white, racist, domains, such, as, enslavement, and, colonialism, drawing, upon, the, writings, and, speeches, of, frantz, fanon, aim, c, saire, and, malcolm, x, advocates, of, black, consciousness, supported, cultural, and, social, activities, that, promoted, a, knowledge, of, black, protest, history, they, actively, promoted, the, establishment, of, independent, black, owned, institutions, and, favored, radical, reforms, within, school, curricula, that, nurtured, a, positive, black, identity, for, young, people, manning, marable, and, peniel, joseph, biko, developed, saso, s, ideology, of, black, consciousness, in, conversation, with, other, black, student, leaders, a, saso, policy, manifesto, produced, in, july, 1971, defined, this, ideology, as, an, attitude, of, mind, a, way, of, life, the, basic, tenet, of, black, consciousness, is, that, the, blackman, must, reject, all, value, systems, that, seek, to, make, him, a, foreigner, in, the, country, of, his, birth, and, reduce, his, basic, human, dignity, black, consciousness, centred, on, psychological, empowerment, through, combating, the, feelings, of, inferiority, that, most, black, south, africans, exhibited, biko, believed, that, as, part, of, the, struggle, against, apartheid, and, white, minority, rule, blacks, should, affirm, their, own, humanity, by, regarding, themselves, as, worthy, of, freedom, and, its, attendant, responsibilities, it, applied, the, term, black, not, only, to, bantu, speaking, africans, but, also, to, indians, and, coloureds, saso, adopted, this, term, over, non, white, because, its, leadership, felt, that, defining, themselves, in, opposition, to, white, people, was, not, a, positive, self, description, biko, promoted, the, slogan, black, is, beautiful, explaining, that, this, meant, man, you, are, okay, as, you, are, begin, to, look, upon, yourself, as, a, human, being, biko, presented, a, paper, on, white, racism, and, black, consciousness, at, an, academic, conference, in, the, university, of, cape, town, s, abe, bailey, centre, in, january, 1971, he, also, expanded, on, his, ideas, in, a, column, written, for, the, saso, newsletter, under, the, pseudonym, frank, talk, his, tenure, as, president, was, taken, up, largely, by, fundraising, activities, and, involved, travelling, around, various, campuses, in, south, africa, to, recruit, students, and, deepen, the, movement, s, ideological, base, some, of, these, students, censured, him, for, abandoning, nusas, multi, racial, approach, others, disapproved, of, saso, s, decision, to, allow, indian, and, coloured, students, to, be, members, biko, stepped, down, from, the, presidency, after, a, year, insisting, that, it, was, necessary, for, a, new, leadership, to, emerge, and, thus, avoid, any, cult, of, personality, forming, around, him, saso, decided, after, a, debate, to, remain, non, affiliated, with, nusas, but, would, nevertheless, recognise, the, larger, organisation, as, the, national, student, body, one, of, saso, s, founding, resolutions, was, to, send, a, representative, to, each, nusas, conference, in, 1970, saso, withdrew, its, recognition, of, nusas, accusing, it, of, attempting, to, hinder, saso, s, growth, on, various, campuses, saso, s, split, from, nusas, was, a, traumatic, experience, for, many, white, liberal, youth, who, had, committed, themselves, to, the, idea, of, a, multi, racial, organisation, and, felt, that, their, attempts, were, being, rebuffed, the, nusas, leadership, regretted, the, split, but, largely, refrained, from, criticising, saso, the, government, which, regarded, multi, racial, liberalism, as, a, threat, and, had, banned, multi, racial, political, parties, in, 1968, was, pleased, with, saso, s, emergence, regarding, it, as, a, victory, of, apartheid, thinking, the, early, focus, of, the, black, consciousness, movement, bcm, was, on, criticising, anti, racist, white, liberals, and, liberalism, itself, accusing, it, of, paternalism, and, being, a, negative, influence, on, black, africans, in, one, of, his, first, published, articles, biko, stated, that, although, he, was, not, sneering, at, the, liberals, and, their, involvement, in, the, anti, apartheid, movement, one, has, to, come, to, the, painful, conclusion, that, the, liberal, is, in, fact, appeasing, his, own, conscience, or, at, best, is, eager, to, demonstrate, his, identification, with, the, black, people, only, insofar, as, it, does, not, sever, all, ties, with, his, relatives, on, his, side, of, the, colour, line, biko, and, saso, were, openly, critical, of, nusas, protests, against, government, policies, biko, argued, that, nusas, merely, sought, to, influence, the, white, electorate, in, his, opinion, this, electorate, was, not, legitimate, and, protests, targeting, a, particular, policy, would, be, ineffective, for, the, ultimate, aim, of, dismantling, the, apartheid, state, saso, regarded, student, marches, pickets, and, strikes, to, be, ineffective, and, stated, it, would, withdraw, from, public, forms, of, protest, it, deliberately, avoided, open, confrontation, with, the, state, until, such, a, point, when, it, had, a, sufficiently, large, institutional, structure, instead, saso, s, focus, was, on, establishing, community, projects, and, spreading, black, consciousness, ideas, among, other, black, organisations, and, the, wider, black, community, despite, this, policy, in, may, 1972, it, issued, the, alice, declaration, in, which, it, called, for, students, to, boycott, lectures, in, response, to, the, expulsion, of, saso, member, abram, onkgopotse, tiro, from, the, university, of, the, north, after, he, made, a, speech, criticising, its, administration, the, tiro, incident, convinced, the, government, that, saso, was, a, threat, in, durban, biko, entered, a, relationship, with, a, nurse, nontsikelelo, ntsiki, mashalaba, they, married, at, the, king, william, s, town, magistrates, court, in, december, 1970, their, first, child, nkosinathi, was, born, in, 1971, biko, initially, did, well, in, his, university, studies, but, his, grades, declined, as, he, devoted, increasing, time, to, political, activism, six, years, after, starting, his, degree, he, found, himself, repeating, his, third, year, in, 1972, as, a, result, of, his, poor, academic, performance, the, university, of, natal, barred, him, from, further, study, in, august, 1971, biko, attended, a, conference, on, the, development, of, the, african, community, in, edendale, there, a, resolution, was, presented, calling, for, the, formation, of, the, black, people, s, convention, bpc, a, vehicle, for, the, promotion, of, black, consciousness, among, the, wider, population, biko, voted, in, favour, of, the, group, s, creation, but, expressed, reservations, about, the, lack, of, consultation, with, south, africa, s, coloureds, or, indians, a, mayatula, became, the, bpc, s, first, president, biko, did, not, stand, for, any, leadership, positions, the, group, was, formally, launched, in, july, 1972, in, pietermaritzburg, by, 1973, it, had, 41, branches, and, 4000, members, sharing, much, of, its, membership, with, saso, my, major, problem, at, this, moment, is, a, strange, kind, of, guilt, so, many, friends, of, mine, have, been, arrested, for, activities, in, something, that, i, was, most, instrumental, in, starting, a, lot, of, them, are, blokes, i, spoke, into, the, movement, and, yet, i, am, not, with, them, one, does, not, think, this, way, in, political, life, of, course, casualties, are, expected, and, should, be, bargained, for, steve, biko, while, the, bpc, was,

white, liberal, editor, of, the, daily, dispatch, under, woods, editorship, the, newspaper, had, published, articles, criticising, apartheid, and, the, white, minority, regime, and, had, also, given, space, to, the, views, of, various, black, groups, but, not, the, bcm, biko, hoped, to, convince, woods, to, give, the, movement, greater, coverage, and, an, outlet, for, its, views, woods, was, initially, reticent, believing, that, biko, and, the, bcm, advocated, for, racial, exclusivism, in, reverse, when, he, met, biko, for, the, first, time, woods, expressed, his, concern, about, the, anti, white, liberal, sentiment, of, biko, s, early, writings, biko, acknowledged, that, his, earlier, antiliberal, writings, were, overkill, but, said, that, he, remained, committed, to, the, basic, message, contained, within, them, over, the, coming, years, the, pair, became, close, friends, woods, later, related, that, although, he, continued, to, have, concerns, about, the, unavoidably, racist, aspects, of, black, consciousness, it, was, both, a, revelation, and, education, to, socialise, with, blacks, who, had, psychologically, emancipated, attitudes, biko, also, remained, friends, with, another, prominent, white, liberal, duncan, innes, who, served, as, nusas, president, in, 1969, innes, later, commented, that, biko, was, invaluable, in, helping, me, to, understand, black, oppression, not, only, socially, and, politically, but, also, psychologically, and, intellectually, biko, s, friendship, with, these, white, liberals, came, under, criticism, from, some, members, of, the, bcm, in, 1977, biko, broke, his, banning, order, by, travelling, to, cape, town, hoping, to, meet, unity, movement, leader, neville, alexander, and, deal, with, growing, dissent, in, the, western, cape, branch, of, the, bcm, which, was, dominated, by, marxists, like, johnny, issel, biko, drove, to, the, city, with, his, friend, peter, jones, on, 17, august, but, alexander, refused, to, meet, with, biko, fearing, that, he, was, being, monitored, by, the, police, biko, and, jones, drove, back, toward, king, william, s, town, but, on, 18, august, they, were, stopped, at, a, police, roadblock, near, grahamstown, biko, was, arrested, for, having, violated, the, order, restricting, him, to, king, william, s, town, unsubstantiated, claims, have, been, made, that, the, security, services, were, aware, of, biko, s, trip, to, cape, town, and, that, the, road, block, had, been, erected, to, catch, him, jones, was, also, arrested, at, the, roadblock, he, was, subsequently, held, without, trial, for, 533, days, during, which, time, he, was, interrogated, on, numerous, occasions, the, security, services, took, biko, to, the, walmer, police, station, in, port, elizabeth, where, he, was, held, naked, in, a, cell, with, his, legs, in, shackles, on, 6, september, he, was, transferred, from, walmer, to, room, 619, of, the, security, police, headquarters, in, the, sanlam, building, in, central, port, elizabeth, where, he, was, interrogated, for, 22, hours, handcuffed, and, in, shackles, and, chained, to, a, grille, exactly, what, happened, has, never, been, ascertained, but, during, the, interrogation, he, was, severely, beaten, by, at, least, one, of, the, ten, security, police, officers, he, suffered, three, brain, lesions, that, resulted, in, a, massive, brain, haemorrhage, on, 6, september, following, this, incident, biko, s, captors, forced, him, to, remain, standing, and, shackled, to, the, wall, the, police, later, said, that, biko, had, attacked, one, of, them, with, a, chair, forcing, them, to, subdue, him, and, place, him, in, handcuffs, and, leg, irons, biko, was, examined, by, a, doctor, ivor, lang, who, stated, that, there, was, no, evidence, of, injury, on, biko, later, scholarship, has, suggested, biko, s, injuries, must, have, been, obvious, he, was, then, examined, by, two, other, doctors, who, after, a, test, showed, blood, cells, to, have, entered, biko, s, spinal, fluid, agreed, that, he, should, be, transported, to, a, prison, hospital, in, pretoria, on, 11, september, police, loaded, him, into, the, back, of, a, land, rover, naked, and, manacled, and, drove, him, 740, miles, 1, 190, km, to, the, hospital, there, biko, died, alone, in, a, cell, on, 12, september, 1977, according, to, an, autopsy, an, extensive, brain, injury, had, caused, centralisation, of, the, blood, circulation, to, such, an, extent, that, there, had, been, intravasal, blood, coagulation, acute, kidney, failure, and, uremia, he, was, the, twenty, first, person, to, die, in, a, south, african, prison, in, twelve, months, and, the, forty, sixth, political, detainee, to, die, during, interrogation, since, the, government, introduced, laws, permitting, imprisonment, without, trial, in, 1963, news, of, biko, s, death, spread, quickly, across, the, world, and, became, symbolic, of, the, abuses, of, the, apartheid, system, his, death, attracted, more, global, attention, than, he, had, ever, attained, during, his, lifetime, protest, meetings, were, held, in, several, cities, many, were, shocked, that, the, security, authorities, would, kill, such, a, prominent, dissident, leader, biko, s, anglican, funeral, service, held, on, 25, september, 1977, at, king, william, s, town, s, victoria, stadium, took, five, hours, and, was, attended, by, around, 20, 000, people, the, vast, majority, were, black, but, a, few, hundred, whites, also, attended, including, biko, s, friends, such, as, russell, and, woods, and, prominent, progressive, figures, like, helen, suzman, alex, boraine, and, zach, de, beer, foreign, diplomats, from, thirteen, nations, were, present, as, was, an, anglican, delegation, headed, by, bishop, desmond, tutu, the, event, was, later, described, as, the, first, mass, political, funeral, in, the, country, biko, s, coffin, had, been, decorated, with, the, motifs, of, a, clenched, black, fist, the, african, continent, and, the, statement, one, azania, one, nation, azania, was, the, name, that, many, activists, wanted, south, africa, to, adopt, post, apartheid, biko, was, buried, in, the, cemetery, at, ginsberg, two, bcm, affiliated, artists, dikob, ben, martins, and, robin, holmes, produced, a, t, shirt, marking, the, event, the, design, was, banned, the, following, year, martins, also, created, a, commemorative, poster, for, the, funeral, the, first, in, a, tradition, of, funeral, posters, that, proved, popular, throughout, the, 1980s, speaking, publicly, about, biko, s, death, the, country, s, police, minister, jimmy, kruger, initially, implied, that, it, had, been, the, result, of, a, hunger, strike, a, statement, he, later, denied, his, account, was, challenged, by, some, of, biko, s, friends, including, woods, who, said, that, biko, had, told, them, that, he, would, never, kill, himself, in, prison, publicly, he, stated, that, biko, had, been, plotting, violence, a, claim, repeated, in, the, pro, government, press, south, africa, s, attorney, general, initially, stated, that, no, one, would, be, prosecuted, for, biko, s, death, two, weeks, after, the, funeral, the, government, banned, all, black, consciousness, organisations, including, the, bcp, which, had, its, assets, seized, both, domestic, and, international, pressure, called, for, a, public, inquest, to, be, held, to, which, the, government, agreed, it, began, in, pretoria, s, old, synagogue, courthouse, in, november, 1977, and, lasted, for, three, weeks, both, the, running, of, the, inquest, and, the, quality, of, evidence, submitted, came, in, for, extensive, criticism, an, observer, from, the, lawyers, committee, for, civil, rights, under, law, stated, that, the, affidavit, s, statements, were, sometimes, redundant, sometimes, inconsistent, frequently, ambiguous, david, napley, described, the, police, investigation, of, the, incident, as, perfunctory, in, the, extreme, the, security, forces, alleged, that, biko, had, acted, aggressively, and, had, sustained, his, injuries, in, a, scuffle, in, which, he, had, banged, his, head, against, the, cell, wall, the, presiding, magistrate, accepted, the, security, forces, account, of, events, and, refused, to, prosecute, any, of, those, involved, the, verdict, was, treated, with, scepticism, by, much, of, the, international, media, and, the, us, government, led, by, president, jimmy, carter, on, 2, february, 1978, based, on, the, evidence, given, at, the, inquest, the, attorney, general, of, the, eastern, cape, stated, that, he, would, not, prosecute, the, officers, after, the, inquest, biko, s, family, brought, a, civil, case, against, the, state, at, the, advice, of, their, lawyers, they, agreed, to, a, settlement, of, r, 65, 000, us, 78, 000, in, july, 1979, shortly, after, the, inquest, the, south, african, medical, and, dental, council, initiated, proceedings, against, the, medical, professionals, who, had, been, entrusted, with, biko, s, care, eight, years, later, two, of, the, medics, were, found, guilty, of, improper, conduct, the, failure, of, the, government, employed, doctors, to, diagnose, or, treat, biko, s, injuries, has, been, frequently, cited, as, an, example, of, a, repressive, state, influencing, medical, practitioners, decisions, and, biko, s, death, as, evidence, of, the, need, for, doctors, to, serve, the, needs, of, patients, before, those, of, the, state, after, the, abolition, of, apartheid, and, the, establishment, of, a, majority, government, in, 1994, a, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, was, established, to, investigate, past, human, rights, abuses, the, commission, made, plans, to, investigate, biko, s, death, but, his, family, petitioned, against, this, on, the, grounds, that, the, commission, could, grant, amnesty, to, those, responsible, thereby, preventing, the, family, s, right, to, justice, and, redress, in, 1996, the, constitutional, court, ruled, against, the, family, allowing, the, investigation, to, proceed, five, police, officers, harold, snyman, gideon, nieuwoudt, ruben, marx, daantjie, siebert, and, johan, beneke, appeared, before, the, commission, and, requested, amnesty, in, return, for, information, about, the, events, surrounding, biko, s, death, in, december, 1998, the, commission, refused, amnesty, to, the, five, men, this, was, because, their, accounts, were, conflicting, and, thus, deemed, untruthful, and, because, biko, s, killing, had, no, clear, political, motive, but, seemed, to, have, been, motivated, by, ill, will, or, spite, in, october, 2003, south, africa, s, justice, ministry, announced, that, the, five, policemen, would, not, be, prosecuted, because, the, statute, of, limitations, had, elapsed, and, there, was, insufficient, evidence, to, secure, a, prosecution, the, ideas, of, the, black, consciousness, movement, were, not, developed, solely, by, biko, but, through, lengthy, discussions, with, other, black, students, who, were, rejecting, white, liberalism, biko, was, influenced, by, his, reading, of, authors, like, frantz, fanon, malcolm, x, l, opold, s, dar, senghor, james, cone, and, paulo, freire, the, martinique, born, fanon, in, particular, has, been, cited, as, a, profound, influence, over, biko, s, ideas, about, liberation, biko, s, biographer, xolela, mangcu, cautioned, that, it, would, be, wrong, to, reduce, biko, s, thought, to, an, interpretation, of, fanon, and, that, the, impact, of, the, political, and, intellectual, history, of, the, eastern, cape, had, to, be, appreciated, too, additional, influences, on, black, consciousness, were, the, united, states, based, black, power, movement, and, forms, of, christianity, like, the, activist, oriented, black, theology, biko, rejected, the, apartheid, government, s, division, of, south, africa, s, population, into, whites, and, non, whites, a, distinction, that, was, marked, on, signs, and, buildings, throughout, the, country, building, on, fanon, s, work, biko, regarded, non, white, as, a, negative, category, defining, people, in, terms, of, an, absence, of, whiteness, in, response, biko, replaced, non, white, with, the, category, black, which, he, regarded, as, being, neither, derivative, nor, negative, he, defined, blackness, as, a, mental, attitude, rather, than, a, matter, of, pigmentation, referring, to, blacks, as, those, who, are, by, law, or, tradition, politically, economically, and, socially, discriminated, against, as, a, group, in, the, south, african, society, and, who, identify, themselves, as, a, unit, in, the, struggle, towards, the, realization, of, their, aspirations, in, this, way, he, and, the, black, consciousness, movement, used, black, in, reference, not, only, to, bantu, speaking, africans, but, also, to, coloureds, and, indians, who, together, made, up, almost, 90, of, south, africa, s, population, in, the, 1970s, biko, was, not, a, marxist, and, believed, that, it, was, oppression, based, on, race, rather, than, class, which, would, be, the, main, political, motivation, for, change, in, south, africa, he, argued, that, those, on, the, white, left, often, promoted, a, class, based, analysis, as, a, defence, mechanism, primarily, because, they, want, to, detach, us, from, anything, relating, to, race, in, case, it, has, a, rebound, effect, on, them, because, they, are, white, black, consciousness, directs, itself, to, the, black, man, and, to, his, situation, and, the, black, man, is, subjected, to, two, forces, in, this, country, he, is, first, of, all, oppressed, by, an, external, world, through, institutionalised, machinery, and, through, laws, that, restrict, him, from, doing, certain, things, through, heavy, work, conditions, through, poor, pay, through, difficult, living, conditions, through, poor, education, these, are, all, external, to, him, secondly, and, this, we, regard, as, the, most, important, the, black, man, in, himself, has, developed, a, certain, state, of, alienation, he, rejects, himself, precisely, because, he, attaches, the, meaning, white, to, all, that, is, good, in, other, words, he, equates, good, with, white, this, arises, out, of, his, living, and, it, arises, out, of, his, development, from, childhood, steve, biko, biko, saw, white, racism, in, south, africa, as, the, totality, of, the, white, power, structure, he, argued, that, under, apartheid, white, people, not, only, participated, in, the, oppression, of, black, people, but, were, also, the, main, voices, in, opposition, to, that, oppression, he, thus, argued, that, in, dominating, both, the, apartheid, system, and, the, anti, apartheid, movement, white, people, totally, controlled, the, political, arena, leaving, black, people, marginalised, he, believed, white, people, were, able, to, dominate, the, anti, apartheid, movement, because, of, their, access, to, resources, education, and, privilege, he, nevertheless, thought, that, white, south, africans, were, poorly, suited, to, this, role, because, they, had, not, personally, experienced, the, oppression, that, their, black, counterparts, faced, biko, and, his, comrades, regarded, multi, racial, anti, apartheid, groups, as, unwittingly, replicating, the, structure, of, apartheid, because, they, contained, whites, in, dominant, positions, of, control, for, this, reason, biko, and, the, others, did, not, participate, in, these, multi, racial, organisations, instead, they, called, for, an, anti, apartheid, programme, that, was, controlled, by, black, people, although, he, called, on, sympathetic, whites, to, reject, any, concept, that, they, themselves, could, be, spokespeople, for, the, black, majority, biko, nevertheless, believed, that, they, had, a, place, in, the, anti, apartheid, struggle, asking, them, to, focus, their, efforts, on, convincing, the, wider, white, community, on, the, inevitability, of, apartheid, s, fall, biko, clarified, his, position, to, woods, i, don, t, reject, liberalism, as, such, or, white, liberals, as, such, i, reject, only, the, concept, that, black, liberation, can, be, achieved, through, the, leadership, of, white, liberals, he, added, that, the, liberal, is, no, enemy, he, s, a, friend, but, for, the, moment, he, holds, us, back, offering, a, formula, too, gentle, too, inadequate, for, our, struggle, biko, s, approach, to, activism, focused, on, psychological, empowerment, and, both, he, and, the, bcm, saw, their, main, purpose, as, combating, the, feeling, of, inferiority, that, most, black, south, africans, experienced, biko, expressed, dismay, at, how, the, black, man, has, become, a, shell, a, shadow, of, man, bearing, the, yoke, of, oppression, with, sheepish, timidity, and, stated, that, the, most, potent, weapon, in, the, hands, of, the, oppressor, is, the, mind, of, the, oppressed, he, believed, that, blacks, needed, to, affirm, their, own, humanity, by, overcoming, their, fears, and, believing, themselves, worthy, of, freedom, and, its, attendant, responsibilities, he, defined, black, consciousness, as, an, inward, looking, process, that, would, infuse, people, with, pride, and, dignity, to, promote, this, the, bcm, adopted, the, slogan, black, is, beautiful, one, of, the, ways, that, biko, and, the, bcm, sought, to, achieve, psychological, empowerment, was, through, community, development, community, projects, were, seen, not, only, as, a, way, to, alleviate, poverty, in, black, communities, but, also, as, a, means, of, transforming, society, psychologically, culturally, and, economically, they, would, also, help, students, to, learn, about, the, daily, struggles, of, ordinary, black, people, and, to, spread, black, consciousness, ideas, among, the, population, among, the, projects, that, saso, set, its, members, to, conduct, in, the, holidays, were, repairs, to, schools, house, building, and, instructions, on, financial, management, and, agricultural, techniques, healthcare, was, also, a, priority, with, saso, members, focusing, on, primary, and, preventative, care, it, becomes, more, necessary, to, see, the, truth, as, it, is, if, you, realise, that, the, only, vehicle, for, change, are, these, people, who, have, lost, their, personality, the, first, step, therefore, is, to, make, the, black, man, come, to, himself, to, pump, back, life, into, his, empty, shell, to, infuse, him, with, pride, and, dignity, to, remind, him, of, his, complicity, in, the, crime, of, allowing, himself, to, be, mis, used, and, therefore, letting, evil, reign, supreme, in, the, land, of, his, birth, that, is, what, we, mean, by, an, inward, looking, process, this, is, the, definition, of, black, consciousness, steve, biko, biko, opposed, any, collaboration, with, the, apartheid, government, such, as, the, agreements, that, the, coloured, and, indian, communities, made, with, the, regime, in, his, view, the, bantustan, system, was, the, greatest, single, fraud, ever, invented, by, white, politicians, stating, that, it, was, designed, to, divide, the, bantu, speaking, african, population, along, tribal, lines, he, openly, criticised, the, zulu, leader, mangosuthu, buthelezi, stating, that, the, latter, s, co, operation, with, the, south, african, government, the, cause, of, black, liberation, he, believed, that, those, fighting, apartheid, in, south, africa, should, link, with, anti, colonial, struggles, elsewhere, in, the, world, and, with, activists, in, the, global, african, diaspora, combating, racial, prejudice, and, discrimination, he, also, hoped, that, foreign, countries, would, boycott, south, africa, s, economy, biko, believed, that, while, apartheid, and, white, minority, rule, continued, sporadic, outbursts, of, violence, against, the, white, minority, were, inevitable, he, wanted, to, avoid, violence, stating, that, if, at, all, possible, we, want, the, revolution, to, be, peaceful, and, reconciliatory, he, noted, that, views, on, violence, differed, widely, within, the, bcm, which, contained, both, pacifists, and, believers, in, violent, revolution, although, the, group, had, agreed, to, operate, peacefully, and, unlike, the, pac, and, anc, had, no, armed, wing, a, staunch, anti, imperialist, biko, saw, the, south, african, situation, as, a, microcosm, of, the, broader, black, white, power, struggle, which, manifests, as, the, global, confrontation, between, the, third, world, and, the, rich, white, nations, of, the, world, he, was, suspicious, of, the, soviet, union, s, motives, in, supporting, african, liberation, movements, relating, that, russia, is, as, imperialistic, as, america, although, he, acknowledged, that, in, the, eyes, of, the, third, world, they, have, a, cleaner, slate, he, also, acknowledged, that, the, material, assistance, provided, by, the, soviets, was, more, valuable, to, the, anti, apartheid, cause, than, the, speeches, and, wrist, slapping, provided, by, western, governments, he, was, cautious, of, the, possibility, of, a, post, apartheid, south, africa, getting, caught, up, in, the, imperialist, cold, war, rivalries, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, biko, hoped, that, a, future, socialist, south, africa, could, become, a, completely, non, racial, society, with, people, of, all, ethnic, backgrounds, living, peacefully, together, in, a, joint, culture, that, combined, the, best, of, all, communities, he, did, not, support, guarantees, of, minority, rights, believing, that, doing, so, would, continue, to, recognise, divisions, along, racial, lines, instead, he, supported, a, one, person, one, vote, system, initially, arguing, that, one, party, states, were, appropriate, for, africa, he, developed, a, more, positive, view, of, multi, party, systems, after, conversations, with, woods, he, saw, individual, liberty, as, desirable, but, regarded, it, as, a, lesser, priority, than, access, to, food, employment, and, social, security, black, said, biko, is, not, a, colour, black, is, an, experience, if, you, are, oppressed, you, are, black, in, the, south, african, context, this, was, truly, revolutionary, biko, s, subsidiary, message, was, that, the, unity, of, the, oppressed, could, not, be, achieved, through, clandestine, armed, struggle, it, had, to, be, achieved, in, the, open, through, a, peaceful, but, militant, struggle, mahmood, mamdani, biko, was, neither, a, communist, nor, capitalist, described, as, a, proponent, of, african, socialism, he, called, for, a, socialist, solution, that, is, an, authentic, expression, of, black, communalism, this, idea, was, derided, by, some, of, his, marxist, contemporaries, but, later, found, parallels, in, the, ideas, of, the, mexican, zapatistas, noting, that, there, was, significant, inequality, in, the, distribution, of, wealth, in, south, africa, biko, believed, that, a, socialist, society, was, necessary, to, ensure, social, justice, in, his, view, this, required, a, move, towards, a, mixed, economy, that, allowed, private, enterprise, but, in, which, all, land, was, owned, by, the, state, and, in, which, state, industries, played, a, significant, part, in, forestry, mining, and, commerce, he, believed, that, if, post, apartheid, south, africa, remained, capitalist, some, black, people, would, join, the, bourgeoisie, but, inequality, and, poverty, would, remain, as, he, put, it, if, south, africa, transitioned, to, proportional, democracy, without, socialist, economic, reforms, then, it, would, not, change, the, position, of, economic, oppression, of, the, blacks, in, conversation, with, woods, biko, insisted, that, the, bcm, would, not, degenerate, into, anti, white, hatred, because, it, isn, t, a, negative, hating, thing, it, s, a, positive, black, self, confidence, thing, involving, no, hatred, of, anyone, he, acknowledged, that, a, fringe, element, may, retain, anti, white, bitterness, he, added, we, ll, do, what, we, can, to, restrain, that, but, frankly, it, s, not, one, of, our, top, priorities, or, one, of, our, major, concerns, our, main, concern, is, the, liberation, of, the, blacks, elsewhere, biko, argued, that, it, was, the, responsibility, of, a, vanguard, movement, to, ensure, that, in, a, post, apartheid, society, the, black, majority, would, not, seek, vengeance, upon, the, white, minority, he, stated, that, this, would, require, an, education, of, the, black, population, in, order, to, teach, them, how, to, live, in, a, non, racial, society, tall, and, slim, in, his, youth, by, his, twenties, biko, was, over, six, feet, tall, with, the, bulky, build, of, a, heavyweight, boxer, carrying, more, weight, than, when, in, peak, condition, according, to, woods, his, friends, regarded, him, as, handsome, fearless, a, brilliant, thinker, woods, saw, him, as, unusually, gifted, his, quick, brain, superb, articulation, of, ideas, and, sheer, mental, force, were, highly, impressive, according, to, biko, s, friend, trudi, thomas, with, biko, you, had, a, remarkable, sense, of, being, in, the, presence, of, a, great, mind, woods, felt, that, biko, could, enable, one, to, share, his, vision, with, an, economy, of, words, because, he, seemed, to, communicate, ideas, through, extraverbal, media, almost, psychically, biko, exhibited, what, woods, referred, to, as, a, new, style, of, leadership, never, proclaiming, himself, to, be, a, leader, and, discouraging, any, cult, of, personality, from, growing, up, around, him, other, activists, did, regard, him, as, a, leader, and, often, deferred, to, him, at, meetings, when, engaged, in, conversations, he, displayed, an, interest, in, listening, and, often, drew, out, the, thoughts, of, others, the, charisma, of, steve, biko, was, entirely, his, own, he, had, from, an, early, age, the, unmistakable, bearing, and, quality, of, a, unique, leader, i, say, unique, because, his, style, of, leadership, was, his, own, it, was, un, pushy, un, promotional, yet, immediately, acknowledged, by, his, peers, i, was, thirteen, years, older, than, steve, yet, i, always, had, the, feeling, i, was, talking, to, someone, older, and, wiser, and, like, many,
