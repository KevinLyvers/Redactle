outstanding, military, successes, in, the, hundred, years, war, against, france, made, england, one, of, the, strongest, military, powers, in, europe, immortalised, in, shakespeare, s, henriad, plays, henry, is, known, and, celebrated, as, one, of, the, greatest, warrior, kings, of, medieval, england, henry, of, monmouth, the, eldest, son, of, henry, iv, became, heir, apparent, and, prince, of,

owain, glynd, r, and, against, the, powerful, percy, family, of, northumberland, he, played, a, central, part, at, the, battle, of, shrewsbury, despite, being, just, sixteen, years, of, age, as, he, entered, adulthood, henry, played, an, increasingly, central, role, in, england, s, government, due, to, the, declining, health, of, his, father, but, disagreements, between, henry, and, his, father, led, to, political, conflict, between, the, two, after, his, father, s, death, in, march, 1413, henry, ascended, to, the, throne, of, england, and, assumed, complete, control, of, the, country, also, reviving, the, historic, english, claim, to, the, french, throne, in, 1415, henry, followed, in, the, wake, of, his, great, grandfather, edward, iii, by, renewing, the, hundred, years, war, with, france, beginning, the, lancastrian, phase, of, the, conflict, 1415, 1453, his, first, military, campaign, included, capturing, the, port, of, harfleur, and, a, famous, victory, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, which, inspired, a, proto, nationalistic, fervour, in, england, during, his, second, campaign, 1417, 20, his, armies, captured, paris, and, conquered, most, of, northern, france, including, the, formerly, english, held, duchy, of, normandy, taking, advantage, of, political, divisions, within, france, henry, put, unparalleled, pressure, on, charles, vi, of, france, the, mad, resulting, in, the, largest, holding, of, french, territory, by, an, english, king, since, the, angevin, empire, the, treaty, of, troyes, 1420, recognised, henry, v, as, regent, of, france, and, heir, apparent, to, the, french, throne, disinheriting, charles, s, own, son, the, dauphin, charles, henry, was, subsequently, married, to, charles, vi, s, daughter, catherine, of, valois, the, treaty, ratified, the, unprecedented, formation, of, a, union, between, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, france, in, the, person, of, henry, upon, the, death, of, the, ailing, charles, however, henry, died, in, august, 1422, less, than, two, months, before, his, father, in, law, and, was, succeeded, by, his, only, son, and, heir, the, infant, henry, vi, analyses, of, henry, s, reign, are, varied, according, to, charles, ross, he, was, widely, praised, for, his, personal, piety, bravery, and, military, genius, henry, was, admired, even, by, contemporary, french, chroniclers, however, his, occasionally, cruel, temperament, and, lack, of, focus, regarding, domestic, affairs, have, made, him, the, subject, of, criticism, nonetheless, adrian, hastings, believes, his, militaristic, pursuits, during, the, hundred, years, war, fostered, a, strong, sense, of, english, nationalism, and, set, the, stage, for, the, rise, of, england, later, britain, to, prominence, as, a, dominant, global, power, henry, was, born, in, the, tower, above, the, gatehouse, of, monmouth, castle, in, mounmouthshire, and, for, that, reason, was, sometimes, called, henry, of, monmouth, he, was, the, son, of, henry, of, bolingbroke, later, henry, iv, of, england, and, mary, de, bohun, his, father, s, cousin, was, the, reigning, english, monarch, king, richard, ii, henry, s, paternal, grandfather, was, the, influential, john, of, gaunt, a, son, of, king, edward, iii, as, he, was, not, close, to, the, line, of, succession, to, the, throne, henry, s, date, of, birth, was, not, officially, documented, and, for, many, years, it, was, disputed, whether, he, was, born, in, 1386, or, 1387, however, records, indicate, that, his, younger, brother, thomas, was, born, in, the, autumn, of, 1387, and, that, his, parents, were, at, monmouth, in, 1386, but, not, in, 1387, it, is, now, accepted, that, he, was, born, on, 16, september, 1386, upon, the, exile, of, henry, s, father, in, 1398, richard, ii, took, the, boy, into, his, own, charge, and, treated, him, kindly, the, young, henry, accompanied, richard, to, ireland, while, in, the, royal, service, he, visited, trim, castle, in, county, meath, the, ancient, meeting, place, of, the, parliament, of, ireland, in, 1399, john, of, gaunt, died, in, the, same, year, king, richard, ii, was, overthrown, by, the, lancastrian, usurpation, that, brought, henry, s, father, to, the, throne, and, henry, was, recalled, from, ireland, into, prominence, as, heir, apparent, to, the, kingdom, of, england, he, was, created, prince, of, wales, at, his, father, s, coronation, and, duke, of, lancaster, on, 10, november, 1399, the, third, person, to, hold, the, title, that, year, his, other, titles, were, duke, of, cornwall, earl, of, chester, and, duke, of, aquitaine, a, contemporary, record, notes, that, in, 1399, henry, spent, time, at, the, queen, s, college, oxford, under, the, care, of, his, uncle, henry, beaufort, the, chancellor, of, the, university, during, this, time, due, to, taking, a, liking, to, both, literature, and, music, he, learned, to, read, and, write, in, the, vernacular, this, made, him, the, first, english, king, that, was, educated, in, this, regard, he, even, went, on, to, grant, pensions, to, composers, due, to, such, love, for, music, from, 1400, to, 1404, he, carried, out, the, duties, of, high, sheriff, of, cornwall, during, that, time, henry, was, also, in, command, of, part, of, the, english, forces, he, led, his, own, army, into, wales, against, owain, glynd, r, and, joined, forces, with, his, father, to, fight, henry, hotspur, percy, at, the, battle, of, shrewsbury, in, 1403, it, was, there, that, the, 16, year, old, prince, was, almost, killed, by, an, arrow, in, his, left, cheekbone, an, ordinary, soldier, might, have, died, from, such, a, wound, but, henry, had, the, benefit, of, the, best, possible, care, over, a, period, of, several, days, john, bradmore, the, royal, physician, treated, the, wound, with, honey, to, act, as, an, antiseptic, crafted, a, tool, to, screw, into, the, embedded, arrowhead, bodkin, point, and, thus, extract, it, without, doing, further, damage, and, flushed, the, wound, with, alcohol, the, operation, was, successful, but, it, left, henry, with, permanent, scars, evidence, of, his, experience, in, battle, bradmore, recorded, this, account, in, latin, in, his, manuscript, titled, philomena, henry, s, treatment, also, appeared, in, an, anonymous, middle, english, surgical, treatise, dated, to, 1446, that, has, since, been, attributed, to, thomas, morstede, the, welsh, revolt, of, owain, glynd, r, absorbed, henry, s, energies, until, 1408, then, as, a, result, of, the, king, s, ill, health, henry, began, to, take, a, wider, share, in, politics, from, january, 1410, helped, by, his, uncles, henry, and, thomas, beaufort, legitimised, sons, of, john, of, gaunt, he, had, practical, control, of, the, government, both, in, foreign, and, domestic, policy, he, differed, from, the, king, who, discharged, his, son, from, the, council, in, november, 1411, the, quarrel, between, father, and, son, was, political, only, though, it, is, probable, that, the, beauforts, had, discussed, the, abdication, of, henry, iv, their, opponents, certainly, endeavoured, to, defame, prince, henry, it, may, be, that, the, tradition, of, henry, s, riotous, youth, immortalised, by, shakespeare, is, partly, due, to, political, enmity, henry, s, record, of, involvement, in, war, and, politics, even, in, his, youth, disproves, this, tradition, the, most, famous, incident, his, quarrel, with, the, chief, justice, has, no, contemporary, authority, and, was, first, related, by, sir, thomas, elyot, in, 1531, the, story, of, falstaff, originated, in, henry, s, early, friendship, with, sir, john, oldcastle, a, supporter, of, the, lollards, shakespeare, s, falstaff, was, originally, named, oldcastle, following, his, main, source, the, famous, victories, of, henry, v, oldcastle, s, descendants, objected, and, the, name, was, changed, the, character, became, a, composite, of, several, real, persons, including, sir, john, fastolf, that, friendship, and, the, prince, s, political, opposition, to, thomas, arundel, archbishop, of, canterbury, perhaps, encouraged, lollard, hopes, if, so, their, disappointment, may, account, for, the, statements, of, ecclesiastical, writers, like, thomas, walsingham, that, henry, on, becoming, king, was, suddenly, changed, into, a, new, man, after, henry, iv, died, on, 20, march, 1413, henry, v, succeeded, him, and, was, crowned, on, 9, april, 1413, at, westminster, abbey, the, ceremony, was, marked, by, a, terrible, snowstorm, but, the, common, people, were, undecided, as, to, whether, it, was, a, good, or, bad, omen, henry, was, described, as, having, been, very, tall, 6, feet, 3, inches, slim, with, dark, hair, cropped, in, a, ring, above, the, ears, and, clean, shaven, his, complexion, was, ruddy, his, face, lean, with, a, prominent, and, pointed, nose, depending, on, his, mood, his, eyes, flashed, from, the, mildness, of, a, dove, s, to, the, brilliance, of, a, lion, s, henry, tackled, all, of, the, domestic, policies, together, and, gradually, built, on, them, a, wider, policy, from, the, first, he, made, it, clear, that, he, would, rule, england, as, the, head, of, a, united, nation, he, let, past, differences, be, forgotten, the, late, richard, ii, was, honourably, re, interred, the, young, edmund, mortimer, 5th, earl, of, march, was, taken, into, favour, the, heirs, of, those, who, had, suffered, under, the, last, reign, were, restored, gradually, to, their, titles, and, estates, yet, where, henry, saw, a, grave, domestic, danger, he, acted, firmly, and, ruthlessly, such, as, during, the, lollard, discontent, in, january, 1414, and, including, the, execution, by, burning, of, henry, s, old, friend, sir, john, oldcastle, in, 1417, to, nip, the, movement, in, the, bud, and, make, his, own, position, as, ruler, secure, henry, s, reign, was, generally, free, from, serious, trouble, at, home, the, exception, was, the, southampton, plot, in, favour, of, mortimer, involving, henry, baron, scrope, and, richard, earl, of, cambridge, grandfather, of, the, future, king, edward, iv, in, july, 1415, mortimer, himself, remained, loyal, to, the, king, starting, in, august, 1417, henry, promoted, the, use, of, the, english, language, in, government, and, his, reign, marks, the, appearance, of, chancery, standard, english, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, english, as, the, language, of, record, within, government, he, was, the, first, king, to, use, english, in, his, personal, correspondence, since, the, norman, conquest, 350, years, earlier, henry, could, now, turn, his, attention, to, foreign, affairs, a, writer, of, the, next, generation, was, the, first, to, allege, that, henry, was, encouraged, by, ecclesiastical, statesmen, to, enter, into, the, french, war, as, a, means, of, diverting, attention, from, home, troubles, this, story, seems, to, have, no, foundation, old, commercial, disputes, and, the, support, the, french, had, lent, to, owain, glynd, r, were, used, as, an, excuse, for, war, while, the, disordered, state, of, france, afforded, no, security, for, peace, king, charles, vi, of, france, was, prone, to, mental, illness, at, times, he, thought, he, was, made, of, glass, and, his, eldest, surviving, son, louis, duke, of, guyenne, was, an, unpromising, prospect, however, it, was, the, old, dynastic, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, first, pursued, by, edward, iii, of, england, that, justified, war, with, france, in, english, opinion, henry, may, have, regarded, the, assertion, of, his, own, claims, as, part, of, his, royal, duty, but, a, permanent, settlement, of, the, national, debate, was, essential, to, the, success, of, his, foreign, policy, following, the, instability, back, in, england, during, the, reign, of, king, richard, ii, the, war, in, france, came, to, a, halt, as, during, most, of, his, reign, relations, between, england, and, france, were, largely, peaceful, and, so, they, were, during, his, father, s, reign, as, well, but, in, 1415, hostilities, were, renewed, between, the, two, nations, and, though, henry, had, a, claim, to, the, french, throne, through, his, great, grandfather, king, edward, iii, by, his, mother, s, side, the, french, ultimately, rejected, this, claim, as, its, nobles, pointed, out, that, under, the, salic, law, of, the, franks, women, were, forbidden, from, inheriting, the, throne, thus, the, throne, went, to, a, distant, male, relative, of, a, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, capet, philip, vi, of, france, resulting, in, the, hundred, years, war, beginning, in, 1337, wanting, to, claim, the, french, throne, for, himself, henry, resumed, the, war, against, france, in, 1415, this, would, lead, to, one, of, england, s, most, successful, military, campaigns, during, the, whole, conflict, and, would, result, in, one, of, the, most, decisive, victories, for, an, english, army, during, this, period, on, 12, august, 1415, henry, sailed, for, france, where, his, forces, besieged, the, fortress, at, harfleur, capturing, it, on, 22, september, afterwards, he, decided, to, march, with, his, army, across, the, french, countryside, toward, calais, against, the, warnings, of, his, council, on, 25, october, on, the, plains, near, the, village, of, agincourt, a, french, army, intercepted, his, route, despite, his, men, at, arms, being, exhausted, outnumbered, and, malnourished, henry, led, his, men, into, battle, decisively, defeating, the, french, who, suffered, severe, losses, the, french, men, at, arms, were, bogged, down, in, the, muddy, battlefield, soaked, from, the, previous, night, of, heavy, rain, thus, hindering, the, french, advance, and, making, them, sitting, targets, for, the, flanking, english, archers, most, were, simply, hacked, to, death, while, completely, stuck, in, the, deep, mud, it, was, henry, s, greatest, military, victory, ranking, alongside, the, battle, of, cr, cy, 1346, and, the, battle, of, poitiers, 1356, as, the, greatest, english, victories, of, the, hundred, years, war, this, victory, both, solidified, and, strengthened, henry, v, s, own, rule, in, england, and, also, legitimized, his, claim, to, the, french, throne, more, than, ever, during, the, battle, henry, ordered, that, the, french, prisoners, taken, during, the, battle, be, put, to, death, including, some, of, the, most, illustrious, who, could, have, been, held, for, ransom, cambridge, historian, brett, tingley, suggests, that, henry, ordered, them, killed, out, of, concern, that, the, prisoners, might, turn, on, their, captors, when, the, english, were, busy, repelling, a, third, wave, of, enemy, troops, thus, jeopardising, a, hard, fought, victory, the, victorious, conclusion, of, agincourt, from, the, english, viewpoint, was, only, the, first, step, in, the, campaign, to, recover, the, french, possessions, that, henry, felt, belonged, to, the, english, crown, agincourt, also, held, out, the, promise, that, henry, s, pretensions, to, the, french, throne, might, be, realized, after, the, victory, henry, marched, to, calais, and, besieged, the, city, until, it, fell, soon, afterwards, and, the, king, returned, in, triumph, to, england, in, november, and, received, a, hero, s, welcome, the, brewing, nationalistic, sentiment, among, the, english, people, was, so, great, that, contemporary, writers, describe, firsthand, how, henry, was, welcomed, with, triumphal, pageantry, into, london, upon, his, return, these, accounts, also, describe, how, henry, was, greeted, by, elaborate, displays, and, with, choirs, following, his, passage, to, st, paul, s, cathedral, most, importantly, the, victory, at, agincourt, inspired, and, boosted, the, english, morale, while, it, caused, a, heavy, blow, to, the, french, as, it, further, aided, the, english, in, their, conquest, of, normandy, and, much, of, northern, france, by, 1419, the, french, especially, the, nobility, who, by, this, stage, were, weakened, and, exhausted, by, the, disaster, began, quarrelling, and, fighting, among, themselves, this, quarrelling, also, led, to, a, division, in, the, french, aristocracy, and, caused, a, rift, in, the, french, royal, family, leading, to, infighting, by, 1420, a, treaty, was, signed, between, henry, v, and, charles, vi, of, france, known, as, the, treaty, of, troyes, which, acknowledged, henry, as, regent, and, heir, to, the, french, throne, and, also, married, henry, to, charles, s, daughter, catherine, of, valois, following, the, battle, of, agincourt, king, sigismund, of, hungary, later, holy, roman, emperor, made, a, visit, to, henry, in, hopes, of, making, peace, between, england, and, france, his, goal, was, to, persuade, henry, to, modify, his, demands, against, the, french, henry, lavishly, entertained, him, and, even, had, him, enrolled, in, the, order, of, the, garter, sigismund, in, turn, inducted, henry, into, the, order, of, the, dragon, henry, had, intended, to, crusade, for, the, order, after, uniting, the, english, and, french, thrones, but, he, died, before, fulfilling, his, plans, sigismund, left, england, several, months, later, having, signed, the, treaty, of, canterbury, acknowledging, english, claims, to, france, command, of, the, sea, was, secured, by, driving, the, genoese, allies, of, the, french, out, of, the, english, channel, while, henry, was, occupied, with, peace, negotiations, in, 1416, a, french, and, genoese, fleet, surrounded, the, harbour, at, the, english, garrisoned, harfleur, a, french, land, force, also, besieged, the, town, in, march, 1416, a, raiding, force, of, soldiers, under, the, earl, of, dorset, thomas, beaufort, was, attacked, and, narrowly, escaped, defeat, at, the, battle, of, valmont, after, a, counterattack, by, the, garrison, of, harfleur, to, relieve, the, town, henry, sent, his, brother, john, duke, of, bedford, who, raised, a, fleet, and, set, sail, from, beachy, head, on, 14, august, the, franco, genoese, fleet, was, defeated, the, following, day, after, the, gruelling, seven, hour, battle, of, the, seine, and, harfleur, was, relieved, diplomacy, successfully, detached, emperor, sigismund, from, supporting, france, and, the, treaty, of, canterbury, also, signed, in, august, 1416, confirmed, a, short, lived, alliance, between, england, and, the, holy, roman, empire, with, those, two, potential, enemies, gone, and, after, two, years, of, patient, preparation, following, the, battle, of, agincourt, henry, renewed, the, war, on, a, larger, scale, in, 1417, after, taking, caen, he, quickly, conquered, lower, normandy, and, rouen, was, cut, off, from, paris, and, besieged, this, siege, has, cast, an, even, darker, shadow, on, the, reputation, of, the, king, adding, to, the, loss, of, honor, following, his, order, to, slay, the, french, prisoners, at, agincourt, the, leaders, of, rouen, who, were, unable, to, support, and, feed, the, women, and, children, of, the, town, forced, them, out, through, the, gates, believing, that, henry, would, allow, them, to, pass, through, his, army, unmolested, however, henry, refused, to, allow, this, and, the, expelled, women, and, children, died, of, starvation, in, the, ditches, surrounding, the, town, the, french, were, paralysed, by, the, disputes, between, the, burgundians, and, the, armagnacs, henry, skilfully, played, one, against, the, other, without, relaxing, his, warlike, approach, in, january, 1419, rouen, fell, those, norman, french, who, had, resisted, were, severely, punished, alain, blanchard, who, had, hanged, english, prisoners, from, the, walls, of, rouen, was, summarily, executed, robert, de, livet, canon, of, rouen, who, had, excommunicated, the, english, king, was, packed, off, to, england, and, imprisoned, for, five, years, by, august, the, english, were, outside, the, walls, of, paris, the, intrigues, of, the, french, parties, culminated, in, the, assassination, of, john, the, fearless, duke, of, burgundy, by, the, dauphin, charles, s, partisans, at, montereau, fault, yonne, on, 10, september, philip, the, good, the, new, duke, and, the, french, court, threw, themselves, into, henry, s, arms, after, six, months, of, negotiation, the, treaty, of, troyes, recognised, henry, as, the, heir, and, regent, of, france, on, 2, june, 1420, at, troyes, cathedral, henry, married, catherine, daughter, of, charles, vi, they, had, only, one, son, henry, born, on, 6, december, 1421, at, windsor, castle, from, june, to, july, 1420, henry, v, s, army, besieged, and, took, the, military, fortress, castle, at, montereau, fault, yonne, close, to, paris, he, besieged, and, captured, melun, in, november, 1420, returning, to, england, shortly, thereafter, in, 1428, charles, vii, retook, montereau, only, to, see, the, english, once, again, take, it, over, within, a, short, time, finally, on, 10, october, 1437, charles, vii, was, victorious, in, regaining, montereau, fault, yonne, while, henry, was, in, england, his, brother, thomas, duke, of, clarence, led, the, english, forces, in, france, on, 22, march, 1421, thomas, led, the, english, to, a, disastrous, defeat, at, the, battle, of, baug, against, a, franco, scottish, army, the, duke, was, killed, in, the, battle, on, 10, june, henry, sailed, back, to, france, to, retrieve, the, situation, it, was, to, be, his, last, military, campaign, from, july, to, august, henry, s, forces, besieged, and, captured, dreux, thus, relieving, allied, forces, at, chartres, on, 6, october, his, forces, laid, siege, to, meaux, capturing, it, on, 11, may, 1422, henry, v, died, on, 31, august, 1422, at, the, ch, teau, de, vincennes, to, the, east, of, paris, the, commonly, held, view, is, that, henry, v, contracted, dysentery, in, the, period, just, after, the, siege, of, meaux, which, ended, on, 9, may, 1422, however, the, symptoms, and, severity, of, dysentery, present, themselves, fairly, quickly, and, he, seems, to, have, been, healthy, in, the, weeks, following, the, siege, at, the, time, speculative, causes, of, his, illness, also, included, smallpox, the, bacterial, infection, erysipelas, and, even, leprosy, but, there, is, no, doubt, he, had, contracted, a, serious, illness, sometime, between, may, and, june, recovering, at, the, castle, of, vincennes, by, the, end, of, june, it, seems, he, was, well, enough, to, lead, his, forces, with, the, intent, of, engaging, the, dauphinist, forces, at, cosne, sur, loire, at, the, outset, he, would, have, been, riding, in, full, armour, probably, in, blistering, heat, as, the, summer, of, 1422, was, extremely, hot, he, was, struck, down, again, with, a, debilitating, fever, possibly, heatstroke, or, a, relapse, of, his, previous, illness, whatever, the, cause, or, causes, he, would, not, recover, from, this, final, bout, of, illness, for, a, few, short, weeks, he, was, carried, around, in, a, litter, and, his, enemies, having, retreated, he, decided, to, return, to, paris, one, story, has, him, trying, one, last, time, to, mount, a, horse, at, charenton, and, failing, he, was, taken, back, to, vincennes, around, 10, august, where, he, died, some, weeks, later, he, was, 35, years, old, and, had, reigned, for, nine, years, shortly, before, his, death, henry, v, named, his, brother, john, duke, of, bedford, regent, of, france, in, the, name, of, his, son, henry, vi, of, england, then, only, a, few, months, old, henry, v, did, not, live, to, be, crowned, king, of, france, himself, as, he, might, confidently, have, expected, after, the, treaty, of, troyes, because, charles, vi, to, whom, he, had, been, named, heir, survived, him, by, two, months, henry, s, comrade, in, arms, and, lord, steward, john, sutton, 1st, baron, dudley, brought, henry, s, body, back, to, england, and, bore, the, royal, standard, at, his, funeral, henry, v, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, on, 7, november, 1422, henry, v, s, death, at, thirty, five, years, of, age, was, a, political, and, dynastic, turning, point, for, both, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, france, the, lancastrian, ruler, had, been, set, to, rule, both, realms, after, charles, vi, s, death, which, occurred, in, october, 1422, less, than, two, months, after, henry, s, own, premature, death, this, caused, his, infant, son, also, called, henry, to, ascend, the, throne, as, king, henry, vi, of, england, at, the, age, of, nine, months, due, to, the, new, king, s, age, a, regency, government, was, formed, by, henry, s, surviving, brothers, john, duke, of, bedford, and, humphrey, duke, of, gloucester, this, acted, as, the, sole, governing, force, of, england, and, its, possessions, in, france, until, henry, vi, came, of, age, in, 1437, although, for, a, time, this, largely, proved, to, be, a, success, with, england, achieving, their, greatest, territorial, extent, in, france, under, the, command, of, bedford, the, later, reign, of, henry, vi, saw, the, majority, of, the, territories, held, by, the, english, lost, or, returned, to, the, french, through, reconquest, or, diplomatic, secession, english, military, power, in, the, region, eventually, ceased, to, exist, this, marked, the, end, of, england, s, sustained, military, success, in, the, hundred, years, war, with, all, their, historic, possessions, and, land, in, france, being, lost, with, the, exception, of, the, pale, of, calais, which, remained, england, s, only, foothold, in, the, continent, until, it, was, lost, in, 1558, the, loss, of, land, in, france, was, a, major, contributing, factor, in, causing, henry, v, s, heirs, and, relatives, to, descend, into, civil, strife, and, quarrel, over, the, succession, of, the, english, crown, in, ensuing, decades, culminating, in, the, wars, of, the, roses, 1455, 1487, between, henry, v, s, descendants, the, house, of, lancaster, and, its, rival, the, house, of, york, henry, v, is, remembered, by, both, his, countrymen, and, his, foes, as, a, capable, military, commander, during, the, war, against, france, and, is, one, of, the, most, renowned, monarchs, in, english, and, british, history, he, is, largely, seen, as, a, symbol, of, english, military, might, and, power, which, inspired, later, kings, and, queens, of, england, his, effect, on, english, history, culture, and, the, military, is, profound, his, victory, at, agincourt, significantly, impacted, the, war, against, the, french, and, led, to, the, english, capturing, most, of, northern, france, this, led, to, the, treaty, of, troyes, in, 1420, in, which, charles, vi, of, france, appointed, henry, his, successor, although, henry, died, two, months, before, charles, in, october, 1422, henry, s, victories, created, a, national, sensation, and, caused, a, patriotic, fervour, among, the, english, people, that, would, go, on, to, influence, both, the, medieval, english, army, and, the, british, army, for, centuries, to, come, his, continuous, victories, against, the, french, during, 1417, 1422, led, to, many, romanticized, depictions, of,

only, remembered, for, his, military, prowess, but, also, for, his, architectural, patronage, he, commissioned, the, building, of, king, s, college, chapel, and, eton, college, chapel, and, although, some, of, his, building, works, were, discontinued, after, his, death, others, were, continued, by, his, son, and, successor, henry, vi, he, also, contributed, to, the, founding, of, the, monastery, of, the, syon, abbey, completed, by, henry, vi, during, his, lifetime, in, the, 16th, century, the, monastery, was, demolished, as, a, result, of, the, growing, movement, of, the, english, reformation, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, viii, henry, v, further, contributed, to, the, church, as, he, was, forced, to, put, down, an, anti, church, uprising, in, the, form, of, the,

reign, henry, was, able, to, rule, without, any, opposition, against, him, henry, v, was, often, a, figure, of, literary, imagination, and, romantic, interpretations, often, used, as, a, traditional,
