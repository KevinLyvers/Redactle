babur, though, nominally, a, mongol, or, moghul, in, persian, language, drew, much, of, his, support, from, the, local, turkic, and, iranian, people, of, central, asia, and, his, army, was, diverse,

palace, during, this, time, two, of, his, uncles, from, the, neighbouring, kingdoms, who, were, hostile, to, his, father, and, a, group, of, nobles, who, wanted, his, younger, brother, jahangir, to, be, the, ruler, threatened, his, succession, to, the, throne, his, uncles, were, relentless, in, their, attempts, to, dislodge, him, from, this, position, as, well, as, from, many, of, his, other, territorial, possessions, to, come, babur, was, able, to, secure, his, throne, mainly, because, of, help, from, his, maternal, grandmother, aisan, daulat, begum, although, there, was, also, some, luck, involved, most, territories, around, his, kingdom, were, ruled, by, his, relatives, who, were, descendants, of, either, timur, or, genghis, khan, and, were, constantly, in, conflict, at, that, time, rival, princes, were, fighting, over, the, city, of, samarkand, to, the, west, which, was, ruled, by, his, paternal, cousin, babur, had, a, great, ambition, to, capture, the, city, in, 1497, he, besieged, samarkand, for, seven, months, before, eventually, gaining, control, over, it, he, was, fifteen, years, old, and, for, him, the, campaign, was, a, huge, achievement, babur, was, able, to, hold, the, city, despite, desertions, in, his, army, but, he, later, fell, seriously, ill, meanwhile, a, rebellion, back, home, approximately, 350, kilometres, 220, mi, away, amongst, nobles, who, favoured, his, brother, robbed, him, of, fergana, as, he, was, marching, to, recover, it, he, lost, samarkand, to, a, rival, prince, leaving, him, with, neither, he, had, held, samarkand, for, 100, days, and, he, considered, this, defeat, as, his, biggest, loss, obsessing, over, it, even, later, in, his, life, after, his, conquests, in, india, for, three, years, babur, concentrated, on, building, a, strong, army, recruiting, widely, amongst, the, tajiks, of, badakhshan, in, particular, in, 1500, 1501, he, again, laid, siege, to, samarkand, and, indeed, he, took, the, city, briefly, but, he, was, in, turn, besieged, by, his, most, formidable, rival, muhammad, shaybani, khan, of, the, uzbeks, the, situation, became, such, that, babar, was, compelled, to, give, his, sister, khanzada, to, shaybani, in, marriage, as, part, of, the, peace, settlement, only, after, this, were, babur, and, his, troops, allowed, to, depart, the, city, in, safety, samarkand, his, lifelong, obsession, was, thus, lost, again, he, then, tried, to, reclaim, fergana, but, lost, the, battle, there, also, and, escaping, with, a, small, band, of, followers, he, wandered, the, mountains, of, central, asia, and, took, refuge, with, hill, tribes, by, 1502, he, had, resigned, all, hopes, of, recovering, fergana, he, was, left, with, nothing, and, was, forced, to, try, his, luck, elsewhere, he, finally, went, to, tashkent, which, was, ruled, by, his, maternal, uncle, but, he, found, himself, less, than, welcome, there, babur, wrote, during, my, stay, in, tashkent, i, endured, much, poverty, and, humiliation, no, country, or, hope, of, one, thus, during, the, ten, years, since, becoming, the, ruler, of, fergana, babur, suffered, many, short, lived, victories, and, was, without, shelter, and, in, exile, aided, by, friends, and, peasants, kabul, was, ruled, by, babur, s, paternal, uncle, ulugh, beg, ii, who, died, leaving, only, an, infant, as, heir, the, city, was, then, claimed, by, mukin, begh, who, was, considered, to, be, a, usurper, and, was, opposed, by, the, local, populace, in, 1504, babur, was, able, to, cross, the, snowy, hindu, kush, mountains, and, capture, kabul, from, the, remaining, arghunids, who, were, forced, to, retreat, to, kandahar, with, this, move, he, gained, a, new, kingdom, re, established, his, fortunes, and, would, remain, its, ruler, until, 1526, in, 1505, because, of, the, low, revenue, generated, by, his, new, mountain, kingdom, babur, began, his, first, expedition, to, india, in, his, memoirs, he, wrote, my, desire, for, hindustan, had, been, constant, it, was, in, the, month, of, shaban, the, sun, being, in, aquarius, that, we, rode, out, of, kabul, for, hindustan, it, was, a, brief, raid, across, the, khyber, pass, in, the, same, year, babur, united, with, sultan, husayn, mirza, bayqarah, of, herat, a, fellow, timurid, and, distant, relative, against, their, common, enemy, the, uzbek, shaybani, however, this, venture, did, not, take, place, because, husayn, mirza, died, in, 1506, and, his, two, sons, were, reluctant, to, go, to, war, babur, instead, stayed, at, herat, after, being, invited, by, the, two, mirza, brothers, it, was, then, the, cultural, capital, of, the, eastern, muslim, world, though, he, was, disgusted, by, the, vices, and, luxuries, of, the, city, he, marvelled, at, the, intellectual, abundance, there, which, he, stated, was, filled, with, learned, and, matched, men, he, became, acquainted, with, the, work, of, the, chagatai, poet, mir, ali, shir, nava, i, who, encouraged, the, use, of, chagatai, as, a, literary, language, nava, i, s, proficiency, with, the, language, which, he, is, credited, with, founding, may, have, influenced, babur, in, his, decision, to, use, it, for, his, memoirs, he, spent, two, months, there, before, being, forced, to, leave, because, of, diminishing, resources, it, later, was, overrun, by, shaybani, and, the, mirzas, fled, babur, became, the, only, reigning, ruler, of, the, timurid, dynasty, after, the, loss, of, herat, and, many, princes, sought, refuge, with, him, at, kabul, because, of, shaybani, s, invasion, in, the, west, he, thus, assumed, the, title, of, padshah, emperor, among, the, timurids, though, this, title, was, insignificant, since, most, of, his, ancestral, lands, were, taken, kabul, itself, was, in, danger, and, shaybani, continued, to, be, a, threat, babur, prevailed, during, a, potential, rebellion, in, kabul, but, two, years, later, a, revolt, among, some, of, his, leading, generals, drove, him, out, of, kabul, escaping, with, very, few, companions, babur, soon, returned, to, the, city, capturing, kabul, again, and, regaining, the, allegiance, of, the, rebels, meanwhile, shaybani, was, defeated, and, killed, by, ismail, i, shah, of, shia, safavid, persia, in, 1510, babur, and, the, remaining, timurids, used, this, opportunity, to, reconquer, their, ancestral, territories, over, the, following, few, years, babur, and, shah, ismail, formed, a, partnership, in, an, attempt, to, take, over, parts, of, central, asia, in, return, for, ismail, s, assistance, babur, permitted, the, safavids, to, act, as, a, suzerain, over, him, and, his, followers, thus, in, 1513, after, leaving, his, brother, nasir, mirza, to, rule, kabul, he, managed, to, take, samarkand, for, the, third, time, he, also, took, bokhara, but, lost, both, again, to, the, uzbeks, shah, ismail, reunited, babur, with, his, sister, kh, nz, da, who, had, been, imprisoned, by, and, forced, to, marry, the, recently, deceased, shaybani, babur, returned, to, kabul, after, three, years, in, 1514, the, following, 11, years, of, his, rule, mainly, involved, dealing, with, relatively, insignificant, rebellions, from, afghan, tribes, his, nobles, and, relatives, in, addition, to, conducting, raids, across, the, eastern, mountains, babur, began, to, modernise, and, train, his, army, despite, it, being, for, him, relatively, peaceful, times, determined, to, conquer, the, uzbeks, and, recapture, his, ancestral, homeland, babur, was, wary, of, their, allies, the, ottomans, and, made, no, attempt, to, establish, formal, diplomatic, relations, with, them, he, did, however, employ, the, matchlock, commander, mustafa, rumi, and, several, other, ottomans, from, them, he, adopted, the, tactic, of, using, matchlocks, and, cannons, in, the, field, rather, than, only, in, sieges, which, gave, him, an, important, advantage, in, india, babur, still, wanted, to, escape, from, the, uzbeks, and, he, chose, india, as, a, refuge, instead, of, badakhshan, which, was, to, the, north, of, kabul, he, wrote, in, the, presence, of, such, power, and, potency, we, had, to, think, of, some, place, for, ourselves, and, at, this, crisis, and, in, the, crack, of, time, there, was, put, a, wider, space, between, us, and, the, strong, foeman, after, his, third, loss, of, samarkand, babur, gave, full, attention, to, the, conquest, of, north, india, launching, a, campaign, he, reached, the, chenab, river, now, in, pakistan, in, 1519, until, 1524, his, aim, was, to, only, expand, his, rule, to, punjab, mainly, to, fulfill, the, legacy, of, his, ancestor, timur, since, it, used, to, be, part, of, his, empire, at, the, time, parts, of, north, india, were, part, of, the, delhi, sultanate, ruled, by, ibrahim, lodi, of, the, lodi, dynasty, but, the, sultanate, was, crumbling, and, there, were, many, defectors, babur, received, invitations, from, daulat, khan, lodi, governor, of, punjab, and, ala, ud, din, uncle, of, ibrahim, he, sent, an, ambassador, to, ibrahim, claiming, himself, the, rightful, heir, to, the, throne, but, the, ambassador, was, detained, at, lahore, punjab, and, released, months, later, babur, started, for, lahore, in, 1524, but, found, that, daulat, khan, lodi, had, been, driven, out, by, forces, sent, by, ibrahim, lodi, when, babur, arrived, at, lahore, the, lodi, army, marched, out, and, his, army, was, routed, in, response, babur, burned, lahore, for, two, days, then, marched, to, dibalpur, placing, alam, khan, another, rebel, uncle, of, lodi, as, governor, alam, khan, was, quickly, overthrown, and, fled, to, kabul, in, response, babur, supplied, alam, khan, with, troops, who, later, joined, up, with, daulat, khan, lodi, and, together, with, about, 30, 000, troops, they, besieged, ibrahim, lodi, at, delhi, the, sultan, easily, defeated, and, drove, off, alam, s, army, and, babur, realised, that, he, would, not, allow, him, to, occupy, the, punjab, in, november, 1525, babur, got, news, at, peshawar, that, daulat, khan, lodi, had, switched, sides, and, babur, drove, out, ala, ud, din, babur, then, marched, onto, lahore, to, confront, daulat, khan, lodi, only, to, see, daulat, s, army, melt, away, at, their, approach, daulat, surrendered, and, was, pardoned, thus, within, three, weeks, of, crossing, the, indus, river, babur, had, become, the, master, of, punjab, babur, marched, on, to, delhi, via, sirhind, he, reached, panipat, on, 20, april, 1526, and, there, met, ibrahim, lodi, s, numerically, superior, army, of, about, 100, 000, soldiers, and, 100, elephants, in, the, battle, that, began, on, the, following, day, babur, used, the, tactic, of, tulugma, encircling, ibrahim, lodi, s, army, and, forcing, it, to, face, artillery, fire, directly, as, well, as, frightening, its, war, elephants, ibrahim, lodi, died, during, the, battle, thus, ending, the, lodi, dynasty, babur, wrote, in, his, memoirs, about, his, victory, by, the, grace, of, the, almighty, god, this, difficult, task, was, made, easy, to, me, and, that, mighty, army, in, the, space, of, a, half, a, day, was, laid, in, dust, after, the, battle, babur, occupied, delhi, and, agra, took, the, throne, of, lodi, and, laid, the, foundation, for, the, eventual, rise, of, mughal, rule, in, india, however, before, he, became, north, india, s, ruler, he, had, to, fend, off, challengers, such, as, rana, sanga, many, of, babur, s, men, allegedly, wanted, to, leave, india, due, to, its, warm, climate, but, babur, motivated, them, to, stay, and, expand, his, empire, the, battle, of, khanwa, was, fought, between, babur, and, the, rajput, ruler, of, mewar, rana, sanga, on, 16, march, 1527, rana, sanga, wanted, to, overthrow, babur, whom, he, considered, to, be, a, foreigner, ruling, in, india, and, also, to, extend, the, rajput, territories, by, annexing, delhi, and, agra, he, was, supported, by, afghan, chiefs, who, felt, babur, had, been, deceptive, by, refusing, to, fulfil, promises, made, to, them, upon, receiving, news, of, rana, sangha, s, advance, towards, agra, babur, took, a, defensive, position, at, khanwa, currently, in, the, indian, state, of, rajasthan, from, where, he, hoped, to, launch, a, counterattack, later, according, to, k, v, krishna, rao, babur, won, the, battle, because, of, his, superior, generalship, and, modern, tactics, the, battle, was, one, of, the, first, in, india, that, featured, cannons, and, muskets, rao, also, notes, that, rana, sanga, faced, treachery, when, the, hindu, chief, silhadi, joined, babur, s, army, with, a, garrison, of, 6, 000, soldiers, babur, recognised, sanga, s, skill, in, leadership, calling, him, one, of, the, two, greatest, non, muslim, indian, kings, of, the, time, the, other, being, krishnadevaraya, of, vijayanagara, the, battle, of, chanderi, took, place, the, year, after, the, battle, of, khanwa, on, receiving, news, that, rana, sanga, had, made, preparations, to, renew, the, conflict, with, him, babur, decided, to, isolate, the, rana, by, defeating, one, of, his, staunchest, allies, medini, rai, who, was, the, ruler, of, malwa, upon, reaching, chanderi, on, 20, january, 1528, babur, offered, shamsabad, to, medini, rao, in, exchange, for, chanderi, as, a, peace, overture, but, the, offer, was, rejected, the, outer, fortress, of, chanderi, was, taken, by, babur, s, army, at, night, and, the, next, morning, the, upper, fort, was, captured, babur, himself, expressed, surprise, that, the, upper, fort, had, fallen, within, an, hour, of, the, final, assault, seeing, no, hope, of, victory, medini, rai, organized, a, jauhar, during, which, women, and, children, within, the, fortress, immolated, themselves, a, small, number, of, soldiers, also, collected, in, medini, rao, s, house, and, killed, each, other, in, collective, suicide, this, sacrifice, does, not, seem, to, have, impressed, babur, who, did, not, express, a, word, of, admiration, for, the, enemy, in, his, autobiography, babur, defeated, and, killed, ibrahim, lodi, the, last, sultan, of, the, lodi, dynasty, in, 1526, babur, ruled, for, 4, years, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, humayun, whose, reign, was, temporarily, usurped, by, the, suri, dynasty, during, their, 30, year, rule, religious, violence, continued, in, india, records, of, the, violence, and, trauma, from, sikh, muslim, perspective, include, those, recorded, in, sikh, literature, of, the, 16th, century, the, violence, of, babur, in, the, 1520s, was, witnessed, by, guru, nanak, who, commented, upon, it, in, four, hymns, historians, suggest, the, early, mughal, period, of, religious, violence, contributed, to, introspection, and, then, the, transformation, in, sikhism, from, pacifism, to, militancy, for, self, defense, according, to, babur, s, autobiography, baburnama, his, campaign, in, northwest, india, targeted, hindus, and, sikhs, as, well, as, apostates, non, sunni, sects, of, islam, and, an, immense, number, were, killed, with, muslim, camps, building, towers, of, skulls, of, the, infidels, on, hillocks, there, are, no, descriptions, about, babur, s, physical, appearance, except, from, the, paintings, in, the, translation, of, the, baburnama, prepared, during, the, reign, of, akbar, in, his, autobiography, babur, claimed, to, be, strong, and, physically, fit, and, that, he, had, swum, across, every, major, river, he, encountered, including, twice, across, the, ganges, river, in, north, india, babur, did, not, initially, know, old, hindi, however, his, turkic, poetry, indicates, that, he, picked, up, some, of, its, vocabulary, later, in, life, unlike, his, father, he, had, ascetic, tendencies, and, did, not, have, any, great, interest, in, women, in, his, first, marriage, he, was, bashful, towards, aisha, sultan, begum, later, losing, his, affection, for, her, babur, showed, similar, shyness, in, his, interactions, with, baburi, a, boy, in, his, camp, with, whom, he, had, an, infatuation, around, this, time, recounting, that, occasionally, baburi, came, to, me, but, i, was, so, bashful, that, i, could, not, look, him, in, the, face, much, less, converse, freely, with, him, in, my, excitement, and, agitation, i, could, not, thank, him, for, coming, much, less, complain, of, his, leaving, who, could, bear, to, demand, the, ceremonies, of, fealty, however, babur, acquired, several, more, wives, and, concubines, over, the, years, and, as, required, for, a, prince, he, was, able, to, ensure, the, continuity, of, his, line, babur, s, first, wife,
