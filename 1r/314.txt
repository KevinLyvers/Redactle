stated, to, time, magazine, people, misunderstood, that, phrase, i, was, deploring, the, way, in, which, president, clinton, was, being, treated, vis, vis, the, sex, scandal, that, was, surrounding, him, i, said, he, was, being, treated, like, a, black, on, the, street, already, guilty, already, a, perp, i, have, no, idea, what, his, real, instincts, are, in, terms, of, race, in, the, democratic,

saying, we, need, to, have, a, conversation, about, race, this, is, the, conversation, i, want, to, see, a, cop, shoot, a, white, unarmed, teenager, in, the, back, and, i, want, to, see, a, white, man, convicted, for, raping, a, black, woman, then, when, you, ask, me, is, it, over, i, will, say, yes, after, the, 2016, election, of, donald, trump, as, president, of, the, united, states,

supremacy, alive, although, her, novels, typically, concentrate, on, black, women, morrison, did, not, identify, her, works, as, feminist, when, asked, in, a, 1998, interview, why, distance, oneself, from, feminism, she, replied, in, order, to, be, as, free, as, i, possibly, can, in, my, own, imagination, i, can, t, take, positions, that, are, closed, everything, i, ve, ever, done, in, the, writing, world, has, been, to, expand, articulation, rather, than, to, close, it, to, open, doors, sometimes, not, even, closing, the, book, leaving, the, endings, open, for, reinterpretation, revisitation, a, little, ambiguity, she, went, on, to, state, that, she, thought, it, off, putting, to, some, readers, who, may, feel, that, i, m, involved, in, writing, some, kind, of, feminist, tract, i, don, t, subscribe, to, patriarchy, and, i, don, t, think, it, should, be, substituted, with, matriarchy, i, think, it, s, a, question, of, equitable, access, and, opening, doors, to, all, sorts, of, things, in, 2012, she, responded, to, a, question, about, the, difference, between, black, and, white, feminists, in, the, 1970s, womanists, is, what, black, feminists, used, to, call, themselves, she, explained, they, were, not, the, same, thing, and, also, the, relationship, with, men, historically, black, women, have, always, sheltered, their, men, because, they, were, out, there, and, they, were, the, ones, that, were, most, likely, to, be, killed, w, s, kottiswari, writes, in, postmodern, feminist, writers, 2008, that, morrison, exemplifies, characteristics, of, postmodern, feminism, by, altering, euro, american, dichotomies, by, rewriting, a, history, written, by, mainstream, historians, and, by, her, usage, of, shifting, narration, in, beloved, and, paradise, kottiswari, states, instead, of, western, logocentric, abstractions, morrison, prefers, the, powerful, vivid, language, of, women, of, color, she, is, essentially, postmodern, since, her, approach, to, myth, and, folklore, is, re, visionist, the, national, memorial, for, peace, and, justice, in, montgomery, alabama, includes, writing, by, morrison, visitors, can, see, her, quote,
