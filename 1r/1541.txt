electors, of, saxony, holy, roman, emperors, building, literature, theater, liturgies, hymnals, monuments, calendrical, commemoration, thomas, m, ntzer, c, 1489, 27, may, 1525, was, a, german, preacher, and, theologian, of, the, early, reformation, whose, opposition, to, both, martin, luther, and, the, catholic, church, led, to, his, open, defiance, of, late, feudal, authority, in, central, germany, m, ntzer, was, foremost, amongst, those, reformers, who, took, issue, with, luther, s, compromises, with, feudal, authority, he, was, a, leader, of, the, german, peasant, and, plebeian, uprising, of, 1525, commonly, known, as, the, german, peasants, war, in, 1514, m, ntzer, became, a, priest, in, braunschweig, where, he, began, to, question, the, teachings, and, practices, of, the, catholic, church, he, then, became, a, follower, and, acquaintance, of, martin, luther, who, recommended, him, for, a, post, in, zwickau, his, beliefs, became, increasingly, spiritual, and, apocalyptic, by, his, arrival, at, allstedt, in, 1523, he, had, completely, broken, with, luther, amidst, the, peasant, uprisings, in, 1525, m, ntzer, organized, an, armed, militia, in, m, hlhausen, he, was, captured, after, the, battle, of, frankenhausen, tortured, and, finally, executed, few, other, figures, of, the, german, reformation, raised, as, much, controversy, as, m, ntzer, which, continues, to, this, day, a, complex, and, unusual, character, he, is, now, regarded, as, a, significant, personality, in, the, early, years, of, the, german, reformation, and, the, history, of, european, revolutionaries, almost, all, modern, studies, stress, the, necessity, of, understanding, his, revolutionary, actions, as, a, consequence, of, his, theology, m, ntzer, believed, that, the, end, of, the, world, was, imminent, and, that, it, was, the, task, of, the, true, believers, to, aid, god, in, ushering, in, a, new, era, of, history, thomas, m, ntzer, was, born, in, late, 1489, or, possibly, early, 1490, in, the, small, town, of, stolberg, in, the, harz, mountains, of, central, germany, the, legend, that, his, father, had, been, executed, by, the, feudal, authorities, is, untrue, there, is, every, reason, to, suppose, that, m, ntzer, had, a, relatively, comfortable, background, and, upbringing, as, evidenced, by, his, lengthy, education, both, his, parents, were, still, alive, in, 1520, his, mother, dying, at, around, that, time, shortly, after, 1490, the, family, moved, to, the, neighbouring, and, slightly, larger, town, of, quedlinburg, and, it, was, as, thomas, munczer, de, quedlinburgk, that, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, leipzig, in, 1506, here, he, may, have, studied, the, arts, or, even, theology, relevant, records, are, missing, and, it, is, uncertain, whether, m, ntzer, actually, graduated, from, leipzig, he, later, enrolled, in, late, 1512, at, the, viadriana, university, of, frankfurt, an, der, oder, it, is, not, known, what, degrees, he, had, obtained, by, 1514, when, he, found, employment, within, the, church, almost, certainly, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, theology, and, or, the, arts, and, possibly, but, less, certainly, a, master, of, the, arts, again, the, university, records, are, incomplete, or, missing, at, some, time, in, this, rather, obscure, period, of, his, life, possibly, before, his, studies, at, frankfurt, he, was, employed, as, an, assistant, teacher, in, schools, in, halle, and, aschersleben, at, which, time, according, to, his, final, confession, he, is, alleged, to, have, formed, a, league, against, the, incumbent, archbishop, of, magdeburg, to, what, end, the, league, was, formed, is, wholly, unknown, in, may, 1514, he, took, up, a, post, as, priest, in, the, town, of, braunschweig, brunswick, where, he, was, occupied, on, and, off, for, the, next, few, years, it, was, here, that, he, began, to, question, the, practices, of, the, catholic, church, and, to, criticize, for, example, the, selling, of, indulgences, in, letters, of, this, time, he, is, already, being, addressed, by, friends, as, a, castigator, of, unrighteousness, between, 1515, and, 1516, he, also, managed, to, find, a, job, as, schoolmaster, at, a, nunnery, in, frose, near, aschersleben, in, the, autumn, of, 1517, he, was, in, wittenberg, met, with, martin, luther, and, became, involved, in, the, great, discussions, which, preceded, the, posting, of, luther, s, 95, theses, he, attended, lectures, at, the, university, there, and, was, exposed, to, luther, s, ideas, as, well, as, other, ideas, originating, with, the, humanists, among, whom, was, andreas, bodenstein, von, karlstadt, who, later, became, a, radical, opponent, of, luther, m, ntzer, did, not, remain, in, wittenberg, for, long, and, was, reported, in, various, other, locations, in, thuringia, and, franconia, he, continued, to, be, paid, for, his, position, at, braunschweig, until, early, 1519, when, he, turned, up, in, the, town, of, j, terbog, north, east, of, wittenberg, where, he, had, been, asked, to, stand, in, for, the, preacher, franz, g, nther, g, nther, had, already, been, preaching, the, reformed, gospel, but, had, found, himself, attacked, by, the, local, franciscans, requesting, leave, of, absence, he, left, the, scene, and, m, ntzer, was, sent, in, the, latter, picked, up, where, g, nther, had, left, off, before, long, the, local, ecclesiastics, were, complaining, bitterly, about, m, ntzer, s, heretical, articles, which, challenged, both, church, teaching, and, church, institutions, by, this, time, m, ntzer, was, not, simply, following, luther, s, teachings, he, had, already, begun, to, study, the, works, of, the, mystics, henry, suso, and, johannes, tauler, was, seriously, wondering, about, the, possibility, of, enlightenment, through, dreams, and, visions, had, thoroughly, explored, the, early, history, of, the, christian, church, and, was, in, correspondence, with, other, radical, reformers, such, as, karlstadt, in, june, 1519, m, ntzer, attended, the, disputation, in, leipzig, between, the, reformers, of, wittenberg, luther, karlstadt, and, philip, melanchthon, and, the, catholic, church, hierarchy, represented, by, johann, eck, this, was, one, of, the, high, points, of, the, early, reformation, m, ntzer, did, not, go, unnoticed, by, luther, who, recommended, him, to, a, temporary, post, in, the, town, of, zwickau, however, at, the, end, of, that, year, he, was, still, employed, in, a, nunnery, at, beuditz, near, weissenfels, he, spent, the, entire, winter, studying, works, by, the, mystics, the, humanists, and, the, church, historians, in, may, 1520, m, ntzer, was, able, to, capitalize, on, the, recommendation, made, by, luther, a, year, earlier, and, stood, in, as, temporary, replacement, for, a, reformist, humanist, preacher, named, johann, sylvanus, egranus, at, st, mary, s, church, in, the, busy, town, of, zwickau, population, at, that, time, ca, 7, 000, near, the, border, with, bohemia, zwickau, was, in, the, middle, of, the, important, iron, and, silver, mining, area, of, the, erzgebirge, and, was, also, home, to, a, significant, number, of, plebeians, primarily, weavers, money, from, the, mining, operations, and, from, the, commercial, boom, which, mining, generated, had, infiltrated, the, town, this, led, to, an, increasing, division, between, rich, and, poor, citizens, and, a, parallel, consolidation, of, larger, manufacturers, over, small, scale, craftsmen, social, tensions, ran, high, it, was, a, town, which, although, exceptional, for, the, times, nurtured, conditions, which, presaged, the, trajectory, of, many, towns, over, the, following, two, centuries, at, st, mary, s, m, ntzer, carried, on, as, he, had, started, in, j, terbog, this, brought, him, into, conflict, with, the, representatives, of, the, established, church, he, still, regarded, himself, as, a, follower, of, luther, however, and, as, such, he, retained, the, support, of, the, town, council, so, much, so, that, when, egranus, returned, to, post, in, late, september, 1520, the, town, council, appointed, m, ntzer, to, a, permanent, post, at, st, katharine, s, church, st, katharine, s, was, the, church, of, the, weavers, even, before, the, arrival, of, lutheran, doctrines, there, was, already, in, zwickau, a, reform, movement, inspired, by, the, hussite, reformation, of, the, 15th, century, especially, in, its, radical, apocalyptic, taborite, flavour, amongst, the, zwickau, weavers, this, movement, was, particularly, strong, along, with, spiritualism, nikolaus, storch, was, active, here, a, self, taught, radical, who, placed, every, confidence, in, spiritual, revelation, through, dreams, soon, he, and, m, ntzer, were, acting, in, concert, in, the, following, months, m, ntzer, found, himself, more, and, more, at, odds, with, egranus, the, local, representative, of, the, wittenberg, movement, and, increasingly, embroiled, in, riots, against, the, local, catholic, priests, the, town, council, became, nervous, at, what, was, going, on, at, st, katharine, s, and, in, april, 1521, at, last, decided, that, enough, was, enough, m, ntzer, was, dismissed, from, his, post, and, was, forced, to, leave, zwickau, m, ntzer, initially, travelled, over, the, border, into, bohemia, to, the, town, of, atec, saaz, this, town, was, known, as, one, of, the, five, safe, citadels, of, the, radical, taborites, of, bohemia, but, m, ntzer, only, used, this, as, a, stop, over, en, route, to, prague, it, was, in, prague, that, the, hussite, church, was, already, firmly, established, and, m, ntzer, thought, to, find, a, safe, home, where, he, could, develop, his, increasingly, un, lutheran, ideas, he, arrived, here, in, late, june, 1521, was, welcomed, as, a, martinist, a, follower, of, luther, and, was, allowed, to, preach, and, to, give, lectures, he, also, found, the, time, to, prepare, a, summary, of, his, own, beliefs, which, appeared, in, a, document, known, to, posterity, slightly, misleadingly, as, the, prague, manifesto, this, document, exists, in, four, forms, one, in, czech, one, in, latin, and, two, in, german, one, of, them, is, written, on, a, large, piece, of, paper, about, 50, by, 50, centimetres, 20, by, 20, in, much, like, a, poster, but, written, on, both, sides, however, it, is, evident, that, none, of, the, four, items, was, ever, published, in, any, shape, or, form, the, contents, of, this, document, indicate, clearly, just, how, far, he, had, diverged, from, the, road, of, the, wittenberg, reformers, and, how, much, he, believed, that, the, reform, movement, was, something, apocalyptic, in, nature, i, thomas, m, ntzer, beseech, the, church, not, to, worship, a, mute, god, but, a, living, and, speaking, one, none, of, the, gods, is, more, contemptible, to, the, nations, than, this, living, one, to, christians, who, have, no, part, of, him, in, november, or, december, 1521, having, discovered, that, m, ntzer, was, not, at, all, what, they, had, supposed, the, prague, authorities, ran, him, out, of, town, the, next, twelve, months, were, spent, wandering, in, saxony, he, turned, up, in, erfurt, and, in, nordhausen, in, each, of, which, he, spent, several, weeks, applying, for, suitable, posts, but, failing, to, be, appointed, he, also, visited, his, hometown, in, stolberg, to, give, sermons, easter, and, in, november, 1522, visited, weimar, to, attend, a, disputation, from, december, 1522, until, march, 1523, he, found, employment, as, chaplain, at, a, nunnery, at, glaucha, just, outside, halle, here, he, found, little, opportunity, to, continue, with, his, desire, for, change, despite, the, existence, of, a, strong, and, militant, local, reform, movement, his, one, attempt, to, break, the, rules, by, delivering, the, communion, in, both, kinds, utraquism, to, a, noblewoman, named, felicitas, von, selmenitz, probably, led, directly, to, his, dismissal, his, next, post, was, both, relatively, permanent, and, productive, in, early, april, 1523, through, the, patronage, of, selmenitz, he, was, appointed, as, preacher, at, st, john, s, church, in, allstedt, in, saxony, he, found, himself, working, alongside, another, reformer, simon, haferitz, who, preached, at, the, church, of, st, wigberti, the, town, of, allstedt, was, small, barely, more, than, a, large, village, population, 600, with, an, imposing, castle, set, on, the, hill, above, it, elector, friedrich, held, the, right, to, appoint, to, st, john, s, but, the, town, council, either, forgot, to, advise, him, or, did, not, feel, that, his, approval, was, necessary, almost, immediately, on, arrival, m, ntzer, was, preaching, his, version, of, the, reformed, doctrines, and, delivering, the, standard, church, services, and, masses, in, german, such, was, the, popularity, of, his, preaching, and, the, novelty, of, hearing, services, in, german, that, people, from, the, surrounding, countryside, and, towns, were, soon, flocking, to, allstedt, some, reports, suggest, that, upwards, of, two, thousand, people, were, on, the, move, every, sunday, within, weeks, luther, heard, of, this, and, wrote, to, the, allstedt, authorities, asking, them, to, persuade, m, ntzer, to, come, to, wittenberg, for, closer, inspection, m, ntzer, refused, to, go, he, was, far, too, busy, carrying, through, his, reformation, and, wanted, no, discussion, behind, closed, doors, at, this, time, he, also, married, ottilie, von, gersen, a, former, nun, in, the, spring, of, 1524, ottilie, gave, birth, to, a, son, it, was, not, only, luther, who, was, concerned, the, catholic, count, ernst, von, mansfeld, spent, the, summer, of, 1523, trying, to, prevent, his, own, subjects, from, attending, the, reformed, services, in, allstedt, m, ntzer, felt, secure, enough, to, pen, a, letter, to, the, count, in, september, ordering, him, to, leave, off, his, tyranny, i, am, as, much, a, servant, of, god, as, you, so, tread, gently, for, the, whole, world, has, to, be, exercised, in, patience, don, t, grab, or, the, old, coat, may, tear, i, will, deal, with, you, a, thousand, times, more, drastically, than, luther, with, the, pope, throughout, the, remainder, of, 1523, and, into, 1524, m, ntzer, consolidated, his, reformed, services, and, spread, his, message, in, the, small, town, he, arranged, for, the, printing, of, his, german, church, service, the, protestation, or, proposition, by, thomas, m, ntzer, from, stolberg, in, the, harz, mountains, now, pastor, of, allstedt, about, his, teachings, and, on, the, counterfeit, faith, in, which, he, set, out, his, belief, that, the, true, faith, came, from, inner, spiritual, suffering, and, despair, in, the, spring, of, 1524, supporters, of, m, ntzer, burned, down, a, small, pilgrimage, chapel, at, mallerbach, much, to, the, annoyance, of, the, abbess, of, the, naundorf, nunnery, the, town, council, and, the, castellan, failed, to, do, anything, about, her, complaint, but, in, july, m, ntzer, was, invited, before, the, electoral, duke, johann, in, allstedt, castle, possibly, in, lieu, of, a, belated, trial, sermon, and, there, he, preached, his, famous, sermon, on, the, second, chapter, of, the, book, of, daniel, aka, the, sermon, before, the, princes, a, barely, concealed, warning, to, the, princes, that, they, should, pitch, in, with, the, allstedt, reforms, or, face, the, wrath, of, god, what, a, pretty, spectacle, we, have, before, us, now, all, the, eels, and, snakes, coupling, together, immorally, in, one, great, heap, the, priests, and, all, the, evil, clerics, are, the, snakes, and, the, secular, lords, and, rulers, are, the, eels, my, revered, rulers, of, saxony, seek, without, delay, the, righteousness, of, god, and, take, up, the, cause, of, the, gospel, boldly, the, immediate, reaction, of, the, princes, is, not, documented, but, luther, did, not, hold, back, he, published, his, letter, to, the, princes, of, saxony, about, the, rebellious, spirit, demanding, the, radical, s, banishment, from, saxony, however, the, princes, simply, summoned, all, the, relevant, persons, of, allstedt, m, ntzer, included, to, a, hearing, at, weimar, where, after, being, interrogated, separately, they, were, warned, about, their, future, conduct, this, hearing, had, the, desired, effect, upon, town, officials, who, back, pedalled, rapidly, and, withdrew, their, support, for, the, radicals, in, the, night, of, 7, august, 1524, m, ntzer, slipped, out, of, allstedt, by, necessity, abandoning, wife, and, son, who, were, only, later, able, to, join, him, and, headed, for, the, self, ruling, imperial, free, city, of, m, hlhausen, around, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, to, the, southwest, m, hlhausen, was, a, city, with, a, population, of, 8, 500, during, 1523, social, tensions, which, had, been, brewing, for, several, years, came, to, a, head, and, the, poorer, inhabitants, had, managed, to, wrest, some, political, concessions, from, the, town, council, building, on, this, success, the, radical, reform, movement, kept, up, the, pressure, under, the, leadership, of, a, lay, preacher, named, heinrich, pfeiffer, who, had, been, denouncing, the, practices, of, the, old, church, from, the, pulpit, of, st, nikolaus, church, thus, before, m, ntzer, arrived, there, was, already, considerable, tension, in, the, air, he, was, not, appointed, to, any, pulpit, but, this, did, not, stop, him, from, preaching, agitating, and, publishing, pamphlets, against, luther, his, comrade, in, arms, here, was, pfeiffer, while, the, two, men, did, not, necessarily, share, the, same, beliefs, as, in, zwickau, with, storch, there, was, enough, common, ground, in, their, reformatory, zeal, and, belief, in, the, inspired, spirit, to, allow, them, to, work, together, closely, a, minor, civic, coup, took, place, in, late, september, 1524, as, a, result, of, which, leading, members, of, the, town, council, fled, the, town, taking, with, them, the, city, insignia, and, the, municipal, horse, but, the, coup, was, short, lived, partly, because, of, divisions, within, the, reformers, inside, the, town, and, partly, because, the, peasantry, in, the, surrounding, countryside, took, issue, with, the, unchristian, behaviour, of, the, urban, radicals, after, only, seven, weeks, in, the, town, on, 27, september, m, ntzer, was, forced, to, abandon, wife, and, child, once, more, and, escape, with, pfeiffer, to, a, safer, haven, he, travelled, first, to, nuremberg, in, the, south, where, he, arranged, for, the, publication, of, his, anti, lutheran, pamphlet, a, highly, provoked, vindication, and, refutation, of, the, unspiritual, soft, living, flesh, in, wittenberg, as, well, as, one, entitled, a, manifest, expos, of, false, faith, both, were, confiscated, by, the, city, authorities, the, former, before, any, copies, could, be, distributed, m, ntzer, kept, a, low, profile, in, nuremberg, clearly, considering, that, his, best, strategy, would, be, to, spread, his, teaching, in, print, rather, than, end, up, behind, bars, he, remained, there, until, november, and, then, left, for, the, southwest, of, germany, and, switzerland, where, peasants, and, plebeians, were, beginning, to, organize, themselves, for, the, great, peasant, uprising, of, 1525, in, defiance, of, their, feudal, overlords, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, what, m, ntzer, did, in, this, part, of, the, world, but, almost, certainly, he, would, have, come, in, contact, with, leading, members, of, the, various, rebel, conspiracies, it, is, proposed, that, he, met, the, later, anabaptist, leader, balthasar, hubmaier, in, waldshut, and, it, is, known, that, he, was, in, basel, in, december, where, he, met, the, zwinglian, reformer, oecolampadius, and, may, also, have, met, the, swiss, anabaptist, conrad, grebel, there, he, spent, several, weeks, in, the, klettgau, area, and, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, he, helped, the, peasants, to, formulate, their, grievances, while, the, famous, twelve, articles, of, the, swabian, peasants, were, certainly, not, composed, by, m, ntzer, at, least, one, important, supporting, document, the, constitutional, draft, may, well, have, originated, with, him, in, february, 1525, m, ntzer, returned, to, m, hlhausen, via, fulda, where, he, was, briefly, arrested, and, then, unrecognized, released, and, took, over, the, pulpit, at, st, mary, s, church, the, town, council, neither, gave, nor, was, asked, for, permission, to, make, this, appointment, it, would, seem, that, a, popular, vote, thrust, m, ntzer, into, the, pulpit, immediately, he, and, pfeiffer, who, had, managed, to, return, to, the, town, some, three, months, earlier, were, at, the, centre, of, considerable, activity, in, early, march, the, citizens, were, called, upon, to, elect, an, eternal, council, which, was, to, replace, the, existing, town, council, but, whose, duties, went, far, beyond, the, merely, municipal, surprisingly, neither, pfeiffer, nor, m, ntzer, were, admitted, to, the, new, council, nor, to, its, meetings, possibly, because, of, this, m, ntzer, then, founded, the, eternal, league, of, god, in, late, march, but, some, researchers, date, this, league, to, september, 1524, this, was, an, armed, militia, designed, not, just, as, a, defence, league, but, also, as, a, god, fearing, cadre, for, the, coming, apocalypse, it, met, under, a, huge, white, banner, which, had, been, painted, with, a, rainbow, and, decorated, with, the, words, the, word, of, god, will, endure, forever, in, the, surrounding, countryside, and, neighbouring, small, towns, the, events, in, m, hlhausen, found, a, ready, echo, for, the, peasantry, and, the, urban, poor, had, had, news, of, the, great, uprising, in, southwest, germany, and, many, were, ready, to, join, in, in, late, april, all, of, thuringia, was, up, in, arms, with, peasant, and, plebeian, troops, from, various, districts, mobilized, however, the, princes, were, laying, their, own, plans, for, the, suppression, of, the, revolt, the, feudal, authorities, had, far, better, weapons, and, more, disciplined, armies, than, their, subjects, at, the, beginning, of, may, the, m, hlhausen, troop, marched, around, the, countryside, in, north, thuringia, but, failed, to, meet, up, with, other, troops, being, content, to, loot, and, pillage, locally, luther, pitched, in, very, firmly, on, the, side, of, the, princes, he, made, a, tour, of, southern, saxony, stolberg, nordhausen, and, the, mansfeld, district, in, an, attempt, to, dissuade, the, rebels, from, action, although, in, some, of, these, places, he, was, roundly, heckled, he, followed, this, up, with, his, pamphlet, against, the, robbing, and, murdering, hordes, of, peasants, calling, for, the, ruthless, suppression, of, the, revolt, this, had, a, title, and, a, timing, that, could, not, have, been, more, ill, considered, since, it, was, the, german, peasantry, who, at, that, time, died, in, their, thousands, at, the, hands, of, the, princely, armies, estimates, put, the, figure, at, 70, 000, 75, 000, possibly, even, as, high, as, 100, 000, at, length, on, 11, may, m, ntzer, and, what, remained, of, his, troops, arrived, outside, the, town, of, frankenhausen, meeting, up, with, rebels, there, who, had, been, asking, for, help, for, some, time, no, sooner, had, they, set, up, camp, on, a, hill, than, the, princes, army, arrived, having, already, crushed, the, rebellion, in, southern, thuringia, on, 15, may, battle, was, joined, it, lasted, only, a, few, minutes, and, left, the, streams, of, the, hill, running, with, blood, six, thousand, rebels, were, killed, but, only, a, few, soldiers, many, more, rebels, were, executed, in, the, following, days, m, ntzer, fled, but, was, captured, as, he, hid, in, a, house, in, frankenhausen, his, identity, was, revealed, by, a, sack, of, papers, and, letters, which, he, was, clutching, on, 27, may, after, torture, and, confession, he, was, executed, alongside, pfeiffer, outside, the, walls, of, m, hlhausen, their, heads, being, displayed, prominently, for, years, to, come, as, a, warning, to, others, m, ntzer, s, theology, has, been, the, subject, of, many, studies, over, the, years, modern, researchers, agree, that, m, ntzer, was, deeply, read, and, that, it, was, his, theology, and, not, any, socio, political, dogma, which, drove, him, to, stand, up, to, feudal, authority, the, short, paragraphs, below, attempt, to, give, a, very, brief, summary, of, his, theology, evident, from, m, ntzer, s, writings, is, his, broad, knowledge, of, aspects, of, the, christian, religion, from, 1514, onwards, possibly, earlier, he, read, widely, in, the, early, christian, fathers, tertullian, and, cyprian, in, the, history, of, the, early, church, eusebius, and, egesippus, in, the, mystics, of, the, late, medieval, period, suso, and, tauler, in, humanist, ideas, which, harked, back, to, plato, and, in, the, bible, itself, by, around, 1522, after, he, had, left, prague, most, of, his, theology, had, matured, and, settled, around, some, guiding, principles, even, if, some, details, such, as, the, identity, of, the, elect, were, unclear, despite, the, profusion, of, biblical, quotations, in, m, ntzer, s, writings, it, was, his, doctrine, that, true, belief, was, dictated, by, spiritual, experience, not, by, written, testimony, the, bible, was, for, him, evidence, only, of, spiritual, experiences, of, the, past, the, words, of, the, bible, still, had, to, be, validated, by, the, working, of, the, spirit, in, the, believer, s, heart, if, someone, had, never, had, sight, or, sound, of, the, bible, at, any, time, in, his, life, he, could, still, hold, the, one, true, christian, faith, because, of, the, true, teaching, of, the, spirit, just, like, all, those, who, composed, the, holy, scripture, without, any, books, at, all, the, insistence, on, written, biblical, proof, by, the, academics, or, scholars, this, included, luther, meant, that, it, was, impossible, for, the, common, man, to, gain, a, true, understanding, of, the, true, faith, m, ntzer, s, true, believers, also, known, as, the, elect, were, capable, of, reaching, faith, through, personal, suffering, guided, by, true, servants, of, god, and, without, regard, to, catholic, or, lutheran, reformed, priests, spiritual, revelation, came, sometimes, through, dreams, and, visions, and, sometimes, through, suffering, in, zwickau, m, ntzer, s, belief, in, the, possibilities, of, revelation, by, dream, matched, the, same, belief, in, the, sect, of, radicals, led, by, nikolaus, storch, storch, was, later, to, confound, luther, s, colleague, melanchthon, with, plausible, arguments, about, this, m, ntzer, himself, clearly, believed, in, the, power, of, vision, and, dream, as, evidenced, by, his, lengthy, and, carefully, argued, sermon, before, the, princes, which, discussed, the, dream, of, nebuchadnezzar, so, to, expect, visions, and, to, receive, them, while, in, tribulation, and, suffering, is, in, the, true, spirit, of, the, apostles, the, patriarchs, and, the, prophets, hence, it, is, no, wonder, that, brother, fatted, pig, and, brother, soft, life, i, e, luther, reject, them, but, when, one, has, not, yet, heard, the, clear, word, of, god, in, the, soul, one, has, to, have, visions, it, was, essential, in, m, ntzer, s, view, for, a, person, to, experience, real, suffering, and, pain, either, spiritual, or, physical, in, order, to, come, to, a, true, christian, belief, the, theme, of, hardship, and, suffering, purgation, and, sevenfold, cleansing, runs, through, all, of, his, writings, what, you, must, do, is, endure, patiently, and, learn, how, god, himself, will, root, out, your, weeds, thistles, and, thorns, from, the, rich, soil, which, is, your, heart, otherwise, nothing, good, will, grow, there, only, the, raging, devil, even, if, you, have, already, devoured, all, the, books, of, the, bible, you, must, still, suffer, the, sharp, edge, of, the, plough, share, on, the, very, eve, of, battle, at, frankenhausen, he, had, this, to, say, to, the, people, of, allstedt, may, the, pure, fear, of, god, be, with, you, dear, brothers, you, must, remain, unperturbed, if, you, fail, to, do, so, then, your, sacrifice, is, in, vain, your, heart, sad, heart, felt, suffering, you, would, then, have, to, start, suffering, all, over, again, if, you, are, unwilling, to, suffer, for, the, sake, of, god, then, you, will, to, be, martyrs, for, the, devil, one, of, the, principal, dialectics, in, m, ntzer, s, teaching, is, the, opposition, of, the, fear, of, man, to, the, fear, of, god, regardless, of, one, s, position, in, society, it, was, necessary, for, the, true, believer, to, have, a, fear, of, god, and, to, have, no, fear, of, man, this, was, the, thrust, of, his, sermon, before, the, princes, and, it, was, the, rallying, call, in, his, final, letter, to, m, hlhausen, in, may, 1525, may, the, pure, upright, fear, of, god, be, with, you, my, dear, brothers, in, his, sermon, before, the, princes, he, stated, quite, clearly, the, fear, of, god, must, be, pure, unsullied, by, any, fear, of, men, or, creaturely, things, how, desperately, we, need, a, fear, like, this, for, just, as, it, is, impossible, to, fear, two, masters, and, be, saved, so, it, is, impossible, to, fear, both, god, and, created, things, and, be, saved, interwoven, with, m, ntzer, s, mystical, piety, as, for, many, of, his, contemporaries, was, a, conviction, that, the, whole, cosmos, stood, at, a, tipping, point, now, god, would, set, right, all, the, wrongs, of, the, world, largely, by, destruction, but, with, the, active, assistance, of, true, christians, from, this, would, emerge, a, new, age, of, mankind, in, the, prague, manifesto, he, wrote, o, ho, how, ripe, the, rotten, apples, are, o, ho, how, rotten, the, elect, have, become, the, time, of, the, harvest, has, come, that, is, why, he, himself, has, hired, me, for, his, harvest, in, a, letter, to, the, people, of, erfurt, in, may, 1525, he, wrote, help, us, in, any, way, you, can, with, men, and, with, cannon, so, that, we, can, carry, out, the, commands, of, god, himself, in, ezekiel, 34, where, he, says, i, will, rescue, you, from, those, who, lord, it, over, you, in, a, tyrannous, way, in, chapter, 39, come, you, birds, of, heaven, and, devour, the, flesh, of, the, princes, and, you, wild, beasts, drink, up, the, blood, of, all, the, bigwigs, daniel, says, the, same, thing, in, chapter, 7, that, power, should, be, given, to, the, common, man, in, his, final, confession, under, torture, of, may, 1525, m, ntzer, stated, that, one, of, the, primary, aims, of, himself, and, his, comrades, was, omnia, sunt, communia, all, things, are, to, be, held, in, common, and, distribution, should, be, to, each, according, to, his, need, this, statement, has, often, been, cited, as, evidence, of, m, ntzer, s, early, communism, but, it, stands, quite, alone, in, all, of, his, writings, and, letters, it, may, have, been, a, statement, of, what, his, captors, feared, rather, than, what, m, ntzer, actually, believed, in, the, same, confession, m, ntzer, is, reported, as, recommending, that, princes, should, ride, out, with, a, maximum, of, eight, horses, and, gentlemen, with, two, m, ntzer, s, own, writings, and, letters, clearly, propose, that, power, be, taken, from, the, feudal, authorities, and, given, to, the, people, for, that, proposal, he, may, be, described, as, a, revolutionary, but, not, proposing, redistribution, of, wealth, subsequent, scholars, have, analysed, m, ntzer, s, movement, as, a, communist, movement, friedrich, engels, analysis, of, thomas, m, ntzer, s, work, and, the, wider, german, peasants, war, led, him, and, karl, marx, to, conclude, that, the, communist, revolution, when, it, occurred, would, be, led, not, by, a, peasant, army, but, by, an, urban, proletariat, the, doctrines, of, essential, suffering, of, spiritual, revelation, of, denial, of, the, fear, of, man, all, combined, with, the, expectation, of, the, apocalypse, to, place, the, elect, person, in, total, opposition, to, feudal, authority, and, to, both, catholic, and, lutheran, teaching, however, this, was, no, individualistic, path, to, salvation, the, importance, which, m, ntzer, laid, on, communal, activities, the, reformed, liturgies, and, the, leagues, he, founded, or, supported, in, zwickau, allstedt, and, m, hlhausen, are, central, to, his, ministry, to, judge, from, his, writings, of, 1523, and, 1524, it, was, by, no, means, inevitable, that, m, ntzer, would, take, the, road, of, social, revolution, however, it, was, precisely, on, this, same, theological, foundation, that, m, ntzer, s, ideas, briefly, coincided, with, the, aspirations, of, the, peasants, and, plebeians, of, 1525, viewing, the, uprising, as, an, apocalyptic, act, of, god, he, stepped, up, as, god, s, servant, against, the, godless, and, took, his, position, as, leader, of, the, rebels, m, ntzer, was, one, of, many, preachers, and, theologians, caught, up, in, the, extraordinary, atmosphere, of, the, early, reformation, in, this, period, from, around, 1517, to, 1525, martin, luther, had, no, monopoly, of, the, reforms, this, was, the, time, not, only, of, luther, but, also, of, erasmus, of, rotterdam, and, fellow, humanists, of, the, alchemists, paracelsus, and, cornelius, agrippa, of, localized, urban, and, rural, acts, of, defiance, the, social, upheavals, triggered, the, reformation, or, more, precisely, the, reformations, for, it, was, above, all, a, time, of, massive, dissent, and, indeed, dissent, from, dissent, in, turn, the, reformation, of, thought, triggered, further, social, and, political, upheavals, in, this, roiling, pot, of, ideas, m, ntzer, quite, readily, respected, luther, for, a, period, and, then, just, as, readily, rejected, the, lutheran, doctrines, although, it, is, clear, in, retrospect, that, m, ntzer, s, ideas, were, already, diverging, from, luther, s, at, least, as, early, as, the, period, in, zwickau, m, ntzer, himself, may, not, have, been, aware, of, this, luther, like, m, ntzer, had, shown, an, avid, interest, in, the, mystic, and, theologian, johannes, tauler, m, ntzer, may, even, have, looked, at, luther, s, many, admiring, references, to, tauler, in, his, theologia, germanica, and, assumed, him, to, be, a, fellow, fan, of, tauler, s, work, in, july, 1520, m, ntzer, was, still, able, to, sign, off, a, letter, to, luther, as, thomas, m, ntzer, whom, you, brought, to, birth, by, the, gospel, however, it, is, clear, that, luther, considered, that, m, ntzer, was, moving, ahead, too, fast, and, correspondence, now, missing, from, wittenberg, seems, to, have, contained, explicit, criticisms, of, his, activities, by, march, 1522, m, ntzer, was, writing, to, melanchthon, in, wittenberg, warning, that, our, most, beloved, martin, acts, ignorantly, because, he, does, not, want, to, offend, the, little, ones, dear, brothers, leave, your, dallying, the, time, has, come, do, not, delay, summer, is, at, the, door, do, not, flatter, your, princes, otherwise, you, will, live, to, see, your, undoing, an, attempt, at, reconciliation, with, luther, in, a, letter, written, by, m, ntzer, from, allstedt, in, july, 1523, went, without, reply, in, june, 1524, however, luther, published, his, pamphlet, a, letter, to, the, princes, of, saxony, concerning, the, rebellious, spirit, which, essentially, called, on, prince, friedrich, and, duke, johann, to, deal, firmly, with, the, rebellious, spirit, of, allstedt, this, bloodthirsty, satan, shortly, afterwards, m, ntzer, described, luther, as, brother, fatted, pig, and, brother, soft, life, in, his, sermon, before, the, princes, after, the, summer, of, 1524, the, tone, of, the, written, conflict, became, ever, more, bitter, on, both, sides, culminating, in, m, ntzer, s, pamphlet, a, highly, provoked, vindication, and, a, refutation, of, the, unspiritual, soft, living, flesh, in, wittenberg, of, 1524, and, in, luther, s, a, terrible, history, and, judgement, of, god, on, thomas, m, ntzer, of, 1525, in, which, the, radical, preacher, by, then, dead, was, described, as, a, murderous, and, bloodthirsty, prophet, during, the, last, two, years, of, his, life, m, ntzer, had, come, into, contact, with, a, number, of, other, radicals, prominent, amongst, them, were, hans, hut, hans, denck, melchior, rinck, hans, r, mer, and, balthasar, hubmaier, all, of, them, were, leaders, of, the, emerging, anabaptist, movement, which, nurtured, similar, reformed, doctrines, to, those, of, m, ntzer, himself, while, it, is, not, appropriate, to, claim, that, they, were, all, or, consistently, m, ntzerites, it, is, possible, to, argue, that, they, all, shared, some, common, teaching, a, common, thread, links, m, ntzer, the, early, anabaptists, the, kingdom, of, m, nster, in, north, germany, in, 1535, the, dutch, anabaptists, the, radicals, of, the, english, revolution, and, beyond, there, was, a, short, lived, legacy, even, within, the, official, reformed, church, as, well, in, the, towns, where, m, ntzer, had, been, active, his, reformed, liturgies, were, still, being, used, some, ten, years, after, his, death, friedrich, engels, and, karl, kautsky, claimed, him, as, a, precursor, of, the, revolutionaries, of, more, modern, times, they, based, their, analysis, on, the, pioneering, work, of, the, german, liberal, historian, wilhelm, zimmermann, whose, important, three, volume, history, of, the, peasants, war, appeared, in, 1843, it, is, not, only, as, an, early, social, revolutionary, that, m, ntzer, has, historical, importance, as, his, activities, within, the, early, reformation, movement, were, influential, on, luther, and, his, reforms, further, interest, in, m, ntzer, was, spurred, at, various, moments, in, german, occasionally, european, history, during, the, creation, of, a, german, national, identity, between, 1870, and, 1914, in, the, revolutionary, era, in, germany, immediately, after, 1918, in, an, east, germany, looking, for, its, own, history, after, 1945, m, ntzer, s, image, was, used, on, the, 5, east, german, mark, banknote, and, leading, up, to, the, 450th, anniversary, of, the, peasant, war, in, 1975, and, the, 500th, anniversary, of, m, ntzer, s, birth, in, 1989, in, terms, of, pure, statistics, the, number, of, books, articles, and, essays, devoted, to, m, ntzer, rose, dramatically, after, 1945, before, that, year, around, 520, had, appeared, between, 1945, and, 1975, another, 500, between, 1975, and, 2012, 1800, since, around, 1918, the, number, of, fictional, works, on, m, ntzer, has, grown, significantly, this, encompasses, over, 200, novels, poems, plays, and, films, almost, all, in, german, a, film, of, his, life, was, produced, in, east, germany, in, 1956, directed, by, martin, heilberg, and, starring, wolfgang, stumpf, in, 1989, shortly, before, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, the, peasants, war, panorama, at, bad, frankenhausen, was, opened, containing, the, largest, oil, painting, in, the, world, with, m, ntzer, in, central, position, the, painter, was, werner, t, bke, very, little, is, known, about, m, ntzer, s, wife, ottilie, von, gersen, other, than, the, fact, that, she, was, a, nun, who, had, left, a, nunnery, under, the, influence, of, the, reformation, movement, her, family, name, may, have, been, von, g, rschen, she, may, have, been, one, of, a, group, of, sixteen, nuns, who, left, the, convent, at, wiederstedt, some, miles, north, of, allstedt, of, whom, eleven, found, refuge, in, allstedt, she, and, m, ntzer, were, married, in, june, 1523, apart, from, the, son, born, to, her, and, m, ntzer, on, easter, day, 1524, it, is, possible, she, was, again, pregnant, at, the, time, of, her, husband, s, death, by, which, time, the, son, may, also, have, died, a, letter, she, wrote, to, duke, georg, on, 19, august, 1525, pleading, for, the, chance, to, recover, her, belongings, from,
