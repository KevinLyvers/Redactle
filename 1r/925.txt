did, not, set, out, to, write, a, chronological, historically, anchored, story, of, benedict, but, he, did, base, his, anecdotes, on, direct, testimony, to, establish, his, authority, gregory, explains, that, his, information, came, from, what, he, considered, the, best, sources, a, handful, of, benedict, s, disciples, who, lived, with, him, and, witnessed, his, various, miracles, these, followers, he, says, are, constantinus, who, succeeded, benedict, as, abbot, of, monte, cassino, honoratus, who, was, abbot, of, subiaco, when, st, gregory, wrote, his, dialogues, valentinianus, and,

480, is, accepted, as, the, year, of, his, birth, the, year, of, his, abandonment, of, his, studies, and, leaving, home, would, be, about, 500, gregory, s, narrative, makes, it, impossible, to, suppose, him, younger, than, 20, at, the, time, benedict, was, sent, to, rome, to, study, but, was, disappointed, by, the, academic, studies, he, encountered, there, seeking, to, flee, the, great, city, he, left, with, his, nurse, and, settled, in, enfide, enfide, which, the, tradition, of, subiaco, identifies, with, the, modern, affile, is, in, the, simbruini, mountains, about, forty, miles, from, rome, and, two, miles, from, subiaco, a, short, distance, from, enfide, is, the, entrance, to, a, narrow, gloomy, valley, penetrating, the, mountains, and, leading, directly, to, subiaco, the, path, continues, to, ascend, and, the, side, of, the, ravine, on, which, it, runs, becomes, steeper, until, a, cave, is, reached, above, this, point, the, mountain, now, rises, almost, perpendicularly, while, on, the, right, it, strikes, in, a, rapid, descent, down, to, where, in, benedict, s, day, 500, feet, 150, m, below, lay, the, blue, waters, of, a, lake, the, cave, has, a, large, triangular, shaped, opening, and, is, about, ten, feet, deep, on, his, way, from, enfide, benedict, met, a, monk, romanus, of, subiaco, whose, monastery, was, on, the, mountain, above, the, cliff, overhanging, the, cave, romanus, discussed, with, benedict, the, purpose, which, had, brought, him, to, subiaco, and, gave, him, the, monk, s, habit, by, his, advice, benedict, became, a, hermit, and, for, three, years, lived, in, this, cave, above, the, lake, gregory, tells, little, of, benedict, s, later, life, he, now, speaks, of, benedict, no, longer, as, a, youth, puer, but, as, a, man, vir, of, god, romanus, gregory, states, served, benedict, in, every, way, he, could, the, monk, apparently, visited, him, frequently, and, on, fixed, days, brought, him, food, during, these, three, years, of, solitude, broken, only, by, occasional, communications, with, the, outer, world, and, by, the, visits, of, romanus, benedict, matured, both, in, mind, and, character, in, knowledge, of, himself, and, of, his, fellow, man, and, at, the, same, time, he, became, not, merely, known, to, but, secured, the, respect, of, those, about, him, so, much, so, that, on, the, death, of, the, abbot, of, a, monastery, in, the, neighbourhood, identified, by, some, with, vicovaro, the, community, came, to, him, and, begged, him, to, become, its, abbot, benedict, was, acquainted, with, the, life, and, discipline, of, the, monastery, and, knew, that, their, manners, were, diverse, from, his, and, therefore, that, they, would, never, agree, together, yet, at, length, overcome, with, their, entreaty, he, gave, his, consent, 3, the, experiment, failed, the, monks, tried, to, poison, him, the, legend, goes, that, they, first, tried, to, poison, his, drink, he, prayed, a, blessing, over, the, cup, and, the, cup, shattered, thus, he, left, the, group, and, went, back, to, his, cave, at, subiaco, there, lived, in, the, neighborhood, a, priest, called, florentius, who, moved, by, envy,
