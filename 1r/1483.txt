that, it, was, a, bold, strategy, which, could, have, been, successful, if, it, had, been, better, implemented, on, the, ground, this, led, to, an, admiration, for, churchill, as, a, military,

for, returning, unemployed, ex, servicemen, in, 1920, while, mayor, he, wrote, his, first, book, the, social, worker, which, set, out, many, of, the, principles, that, informed, his, political, philosophy, and, that, were, to, underpin, the, actions, of, his, government, in, later, years, the, book, attacked, the, idea, that, looking, after, the, poor, could, be, left, to, voluntary, action, he, wrote, that, in, a, civilised, community, although, it, may, be, composed, of, self, reliant, individuals, there, will, be, some, persons, who, will, be, unable, at, some, period, of, their, lives, to, look, after, themselves, and, the, question, of, what, is, to, happen, to, them, may, be, solved, in, three, ways, they, may, be, neglected, they, may, be, cared, for, by, the, organised, community, as, of, right, or, they, may, be, left, to, the, goodwill, of, individuals, in, the, community, charity, is, only, possible, without, loss, of, dignity, between, equals, a, right, established, by, law, such, as, that, to, an, old, age, pension, is, less, galling, than, an, allowance, made, by, a, rich, man, to, a, poor, one, dependent, on, his, view, of, the, recipient, s, character, and, terminable, at, his, caprice, in, 1921, george, lansbury, the, labour, mayor, of, the, neighbouring, borough, of, poplar, and, future, labour, party, leader, launched, the, poplar, rates, rebellion, a, campaign, of, disobedience, seeking, to, equalise, the, poor, relief, burden, across, all, the, london, boroughs, attlee, who, was, a, personal, friend, of, lansbury, strongly, supported, this, however, herbert, morrison, the, labour, mayor, of, nearby, hackney, and, one, of, the, main, figures, in, the, london, labour, party, strongly, denounced, lansbury, and, the, rebellion, during, this, period, attlee, developed, a, lifelong, dislike, of, morrison, at, the, 1922, general, election, attlee, became, the, member, of, parliament, mp, for, the, constituency, of, limehouse, in, stepney, at, the, time, he, admired, ramsay, macdonald, and, helped, him, get, elected, as, labour, party, leader, at, the, 1922, leadership, election, he, served, as, macdonald, s, parliamentary, private, secretary, for, the, brief, 1922, parliament, his, first, taste, of, ministerial, office, came, in, 1924, when, he, served, as, under, secretary, of, state, for, war, in, the, short, lived, first, labour, government, led, by, macdonald, attlee, opposed, the, 1926, general, strike, believing, that, strike, action, should, not, be, used, as, a, political, weapon, however, when, it, happened, he, did, not, attempt, to, undermine, it, at, the, time, of, the, strike, he, was, chairman, of, the, stepney, borough, electricity, committee, he, negotiated, a, deal, with, the, electrical, trade, union, so, that, they, would, continue, to, supply, power, to, hospitals, but, would, end, supplies, to, factories, one, firm, scammell, and, nephew, ltd, took, a, civil, action, against, attlee, and, the, other, labour, members, of, the, committee, although, not, against, the, conservative, members, who, had, also, supported, this, the, court, found, against, attlee, and, his, fellow, councillors, and, they, were, ordered, to, pay, 300, damages, the, decision, was, later, reversed, on, appeal, but, the, financial, problems, caused, by, the, episode, almost, forced, attlee, out, of, politics, in, 1927, he, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, multi, party, simon, commission, a, royal, commission, set, up, to, examine, the, possibility, of, granting, self, rule, to, india, due, to, the, time, he, needed, to, devote, to, the, commission, and, contrary, to, a, promise, macdonald, made, to, attlee, to, induce, him, to, serve, on, the, commission, he, was, not, initially, offered, a, ministerial, post, in, the, second, labour, government, which, entered, office, after, the, 1929, general, election, attlee, s, service, on, the, commission, equipped, him, with, a, thorough, exposure, to, india, and, many, of, its, political, leaders, by, 1933, he, argued, that, british, rule, was, alien, to, india, and, was, unable, to, make, the, social, and, economic, reforms, necessary, for, india, s, progress, he, became, the, british, leader, most, sympathetic, to, indian, independence, as, a, dominion, preparing, him, for, his, role, in, deciding, on, independence, in, 1947, in, may, 1930, labour, mp, oswald, mosley, left, the, party, after, its, rejection, of, his, proposals, for, solving, the, unemployment, problem, and, attlee, was, given, mosley, s, post, of, chancellor, of, the, duchy, of, lancaster, in, march, 1931, he, became, postmaster, general, a, post, he, held, for, five, months, until, august, when, the, labour, government, fell, after, failing, to, agree, on, how, to, tackle, the, financial, crisis, of, the, great, depression, that, month, macdonald, and, a, few, of, his, allies, formed, a, national, government, with, the, conservatives, and, liberals, leading, them, to, be, expelled, from, labour, macdonald, offered, attlee, a, job, in, the, national, government, but, he, turned, down, the, offer, and, opted, to, stay, loyal, to, the, main, labour, party, after, ramsay, macdonald, formed, the, national, government, labour, was, deeply, divided, attlee, had, long, been, close, to, macdonald, and, now, felt, betrayed, as, did, most, labour, politicians, during, the, course, of, the, second, labour, government, attlee, had, become, increasingly, disillusioned, with, macdonald, whom, he, came, to, regard, as, vain, and, incompetent, and, of, whom, he, later, wrote, scathingly, in, his, autobiography, he, would, write, in, the, old, days, i, had, looked, up, to, macdonald, as, a, great, leader, he, had, a, fine, presence, and, great, oratorical, power, the, unpopular, line, which, he, took, during, the, first, world, war, seemed, to, mark, him, as, a, man, of, character, despite, his, mishandling, of, the, red, letter, episode, i, had, not, appreciated, his, defects, until, he, took, office, a, second, time, i, then, realised, his, reluctance, to, take, positive, action, and, noted, with, dismay, his, increasing, vanity, and, snobbery, while, his, habit, of, telling, me, a, junior, minister, the, poor, opinion, he, had, of, all, his, cabinet, colleagues, made, an, unpleasant, impression, i, had, not, however, expected, that, he, would, perpetrate, the, greatest, betrayal, in, the, political, history, of, this, country, the, shock, to, the, party, was, very, great, especially, to, the, loyal, workers, of, the, rank, and, file, who, had, made, great, sacrifices, for, these, men, the, general, election, held, in, october, 1931, proved, disastrous, for, the, labour, party, which, lost, over, 200, seats, returning, only, 52, mps, to, parliament, the, vast, majority, of, the, party, s, senior, figures, including, the, leader, arthur, henderson, lost, their, seats, attlee, however, narrowly, retained, his, limehouse, seat, with, his, majority, being, slashed, from, 7, 288, to, just, 551, he, was, one, of, only, three, labour, mps, who, had, experience, of, government, to, retain, their, seats, along, with, george, lansbury, and, stafford, cripps, accordingly, lansbury, was, elected, leader, unopposed, with, attlee, as, his, deputy, most, of, the, remaining, labour, mps, after, 1931, were, elderly, trade, union, officials, who, could, not, contribute, much, to, debates, lansbury, was, in, his, 70s, and, stafford, cripps, another, main, figure, of, the, labour, front, bench, who, had, entered, parliament, in, january, 1931, lacked, parliamentary, experience, as, one, of, the, most, capable, and, experienced, of, the, remaining, labour, mps, attlee, therefore, shouldered, a, lot, of, the, burden, of, providing, an, opposition, to, the, national, government, in, the, years, 1931, to, 1935, during, this, time, he, had, to, extend, his, knowledge, of, subjects, which, he, had, not, studied, in, any, depth, before, such, as, finance, and, foreign, affairs, in, order, to, provide, an, effective, opposition, to, the, government, attlee, effectively, served, as, labour, s, acting, leader, for, nine, months, from, december, 1933, after, lansbury, fractured, his, thigh, in, an, accident, this, raised, attlee, s, public, profile, considerably, it, was, during, this, period, however, that, personal, financial, problems, almost, forced, attlee, to, quit, politics, altogether, his, wife, had, become, ill, and, at, that, time, there, was, no, separate, salary, for, the, leader, of, the, opposition, on, the, verge, of, resigning, from, parliament, he, was, persuaded, to, stay, by, stafford, cripps, a, wealthy, socialist, who, agreed, to, make, a, donation, to, party, funds, to, pay, him, an, additional, salary, until, lansbury, could, take, over, again, during, 1932, 33, attlee, flirted, with, and, then, drew, back, from, radicalism, influenced, by, stafford, cripps, who, was, then, on, the, radical, wing, of, the, party, he, was, briefly, a, member, of, the, socialist, league, which, had, been, formed, by, former, independent, labour, party, ilp, members, who, opposed, the, ilp, s, disaffiliation, from, the, main, labour, party, in, 1932, at, one, point, he, agreed, with, the, proposition, put, forward, by, cripps, that, gradual, reform, was, inadequate, and, that, a, socialist, government, would, have, to, pass, an, emergency, powers, act, allowing, it, to, rule, by, decree, to, overcome, any, opposition, by, vested, interests, until, it, was, safe, to, restore, democracy, he, admired, oliver, cromwell, s, strong, armed, rule, and, use, of, major, generals, to, control, england, after, looking, more, closely, at, hitler, mussolini, stalin, and, even, his, former, colleague, oswald, mosley, leader, of, the, new, blackshirt, fascist, movement, in, britain, attlee, retreated, from, radicalism, distanced, himself, from, the, league, and, argued, instead, that, the, labour, party, must, adhere, to, constitutional, methods, and, stand, forthright, for, democracy, and, against, totalitarianism, either, of, the, left, or, of, the, right, he, always, supported, the, crown, and, as, prime, minister, was, close, to, king, george, vi, george, lansbury, a, committed, pacifist, resigned, as, the, leader, of, the, labour, party, at, the, 1935, party, conference, on, 8, october, after, delegates, voted, in, favour, of, sanctions, against, italy, for, its, aggression, against, abyssinia, lansbury, had, strongly, opposed, the, policy, and, felt, unable, to, continue, leading, the, party, taking, advantage, of, the, disarray, in, the, labour, party, the, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, announced, on, 19, october, that, a, general, election, would, be, held, on, 14, november, with, no, time, for, a, leadership, contest, the, party, agreed, that, attlee, should, serve, as, interim, leader, on, the, understanding, that, a, leadership, election, would, be, held, after, the, general, election, attlee, therefore, led, labour, through, the, 1935, election, which, saw, the, party, stage, a, partial, comeback, from, its, disastrous, 1931, performance, winning, 38, per, cent, of, the, vote, the, highest, share, labour, had, won, up, to, that, point, and, gaining, over, one, hundred, seats, attlee, stood, in, the, subsequent, leadership, election, held, soon, afterward, where, he, was, opposed, by, herbert, morrison, who, had, just, re, entered, parliament, in, the, recent, election, and, arthur, greenwood, morrison, was, seen, as, the, favourite, but, was, distrusted, by, many, sections, of, the, party, especially, the, left, wing, arthur, greenwood, meanwhile, was, a, popular, figure, in, the, party, however, his, leadership, bid, was, severely, hampered, by, his, alcohol, problem, attlee, was, able, to, come, across, as, a, competent, and, unifying, figure, particularly, having, already, led, the, party, through, a, general, election, he, went, on, to, come, first, in, both, the, first, and, second, ballots, formally, being, elected, leader, of, the, labour, party, on, 3, december, 1935, throughout, the, 1920s, and, most, of, the, 1930s, the, labour, party, s, official, policy, had, been, to, oppose, rearmament, instead, supporting, internationalism, and, collective, security, under, the, league, of, nations, at, the, 1934, labour, party, conference, attlee, declared, that, we, have, absolutely, abandoned, any, idea, of, nationalist, loyalty, we, are, deliberately, putting, a, world, order, before, our, loyalty, to, our, own, country, we, say, we, want, to, see, put, on, the, statute, book, something, which, will, make, our, people, citizens, of, the, world, before, they, are, citizens, of, this, country, during, a, debate, on, defence, in, commons, a, year, later, attlee, said, we, are, told, in, the, white, paper, that, there, is, danger, against, which, we, have, to, guard, ourselves, we, do, not, think, you, can, do, it, by, national, defence, we, think, you, can, only, do, it, by, moving, forward, to, a, new, world, a, world, of, law, the, abolition, of, national, armaments, with, a, world, force, and, a, world, economic, system, i, shall, be, told, that, that, is, quite, impossible, shortly, after, those, comments, adolf, hitler, proclaimed, that, german, rearmament, offered, no, threat, to, world, peace, attlee, responded, the, next, day, noting, that, hitler, s, speech, although, containing, unfavourable, references, to, the, soviet, union, created, a, chance, to, call, a, halt, in, the, armaments, race, we, do, not, think, that, our, answer, to, herr, hitler, should, be, just, rearmament, we, are, in, an, age, of, rearmaments, but, we, on, this, side, cannot, accept, that, position, attlee, played, little, part, in, the, events, that, would, lead, up, to, the, abdication, of, edward, viii, for, despite, baldwin, s, threat, to, step, down, if, edward, attempted, to, remain, on, the, throne, after, marrying, wallis, simpson, labour, was, widely, accepted, not, to, be, a, viable, alternative, government, owing, to, the, national, government, s, overwhelming, majority, in, the, commons, attlee, along, with, liberal, leader, archibald, sinclair, was, eventually, consulted, with, by, baldwin, on, 24, november, 1936, and, attlee, agreed, with, both, baldwin, and, sinclair, that, edward, could, not, remain, on, the, throne, firmly, eliminating, any, prospect, of, any, alternative, government, forming, were, baldwin, to, resign, in, april, 1936, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, neville, chamberlain, introduced, a, budget, which, increased, the, amount, spent, on, the, armed, forces, attlee, made, a, radio, broadcast, in, opposition, to, it, saying, was, the, natural, expression, of, the, character, of, the, present, government, there, was, hardly, any, increase, allowed, for, the, services, which, went, to, build, up, the, life, of, the, people, education, and, health, everything, was, devoted, to, piling, up, the, instruments, of, death, the, chancellor, expressed, great, regret, that, he, should, have, to, spend, so, much, on, armaments, but, said, that, it, was, absolutely, necessary, and, was, due, only, to, the, actions, of, other, nations, one, would, think, to, listen, to, him, that, the, government, had, no, responsibility, for, the, state, of, world, affairs, the, government, has, now, resolved, to, enter, upon, an, arms, race, and, the, people, will, have, to, pay, for, their, mistake, in, believing, that, it, could, be, trusted, to, carry, out, a, policy, of, peace, this, is, a, war, budget, we, can, look, in, the, future, for, no, advance, in, social, legislation, all, available, resources, are, to, be, devoted, to, armaments, in, june, 1936, the, conservative, mp, duff, cooper, called, for, an, anglo, french, alliance, against, possible, german, aggression, and, called, for, all, parties, to, support, one, attlee, condemned, this, we, say, that, any, suggestion, of, an, alliance, of, this, kind, an, alliance, in, which, one, country, is, bound, to, another, right, or, wrong, by, some, overwhelming, necessity, is, contrary, to, the, spirit, of, the, league, of, nations, is, contrary, to, the, covenant, is, contrary, to, locarno, is, contrary, to, the, obligations, which, this, country, has, undertaken, and, is, contrary, to, the, professed, policy, of, this, government, at, the, labour, party, conference, at, edinburgh, in, october, attlee, reiterated, that, there, can, be, no, question, of, our, supporting, the, government, in, its, rearmament, policy, however, with, the, rising, threat, from, nazi, germany, and, the, ineffectiveness, of, the, league, of, nations, this, policy, eventually, lost, credibility, by, 1937, labour, had, jettisoned, its, pacifist, position, and, came, to, support, rearmament, and, oppose, neville, chamberlain, s, policy, of, appeasement, however, attlee, and, the, labour, party, strongly, opposed, conscription, when, it, was, passed, in, april, 1939, at, the, end, of, 1937, attlee, and, a, party, of, three, labour, mps, visited, spain, and, visited, the, british, battalion, of, the, international, brigades, fighting, in, the, spanish, civil, war, one, of, the, companies, was, named, the, major, attlee, company, in, his, honour, attlee, was, supportive, of, the, republican, government, in, spain, and, at, the, 1937, labour, conference, moved, the, wider, labour, party, towards, opposing, what, he, considered, the, farce, of, the, non, intervention, committee, organised, by, the, british, and, french, governments, in, the, house, of, commons, attlee, stated, i, cannot, understand, the, delusion, that, if, franco, wins, with, italian, and, german, aid, he, will, immediately, become, independent, i, think, it, is, a, ridiculous, proposition, dalton, the, labour, party, s, spokesman, on, foreign, policy, also, thought, that, franco, would, ally, with, germany, and, italy, however, franco, s, subsequent, behaviour, proved, it, was, not, such, a, ridiculous, proposition, as, dalton, later, acknowledged, franco, skilfully, maintained, spanish, neutrality, whereas, hitler, would, likely, have, occupied, spain, if, franco, had, lost, the, civil, war, in, 1938, attlee, opposed, the, munich, agreement, in, which, chamberlain, negotiated, with, hitler, to, give, germany, the, german, speaking, parts, of, czechoslovakia, the, sudetenland, we, all, feel, relief, that, war, has, not, come, this, time, we, cannot, however, feel, that, peace, has, been, established, but, that, we, have, nothing, but, an, armistice, in, a, state, of, war, we, have, been, unable, to, go, in, for, care, free, rejoicing, we, have, felt, that, we, are, in, the, midst, of, a, tragedy, humiliation, this, has, not, been, a, victory, for, reason, and, humanity, it, has, been, a, victory, for, brute, force, at, every, stage, of, the, proceedings, there, have, been, time, limits, laid, down, terms, laid, down, as, ultimata, we, have, seen, to, day, a, gallant, civilised, and, democratic, people, betrayed, and, handed, over, to, a, ruthless, despotism, the, events, of, these, last, few, days, constitute, one, of, the, greatest, diplomatic, defeats, that, this, country, and, france, have, ever, sustained, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, it, is, a, tremendous, victory, for, herr, hitler, without, firing, a, shot, by, the, mere, display, of, military, force, he, has, achieved, a, dominating, position, in, europe, which, germany, failed, to, win, after, four, years, of, war, he, has, overturned, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, destroyed, the, last, fortress, of, democracy, in, eastern, europe, which, stood, in, the, way, of, his, ambition, he, has, opened, his, way, to, the, food, the, oil, and, the, resources, which, he, requires, in, order, to, consolidate, his, military, power, and, he, has, successfully, defeated, and, reduced, to, impotence, the, forces, that, might, have, stood, against, the, rule, of, violence, the, cause, was, not, the, existence, of, minorities, in, czechoslovakia, it, was, not, that, the, position, of, the, sudeten, germans, had, become, intolerable, it, was, not, the, wonderful, principle, of, self, determination, it, was, because, herr, hitler, had, decided, that, the, time, was, ripe, for, another, step, forward, in, his, design, to, dominate, europe, the, minorities, question, is, no, new, one, short, of, a, drastic, and, entire, reshuffling, of, these, populations, there, is, no, possible, solution, to, the, problem, of, minorities, in, europe, except, toleration, however, the, new, czechoslovakian, state, did, not, provide, equal, rights, to, the, slovaks, and, sudeten, germans, with, the, historian, arnold, j, toynbee, already, having, noted, that, for, the, germans, magyars, and, poles, who, account, between, them, for, more, than, one, quarter, of, the, whole, population, the, present, regime, in, czechoslovakia, is, not, essentially, different, from, the, regimes, in, the, surrounding, countries, anthony, eden, in, the, munich, debate, acknowledged, that, there, had, been, discrimination, even, severe, discrimination, against, the, sudeten, germans, in, 1937, attlee, wrote, a, book, entitled, the, labour, party, in, perspective, that, sold, fairly, well, in, which, he, set, out, some, of, his, views, he, argued, that, there, was, no, point, in, labour, compromising, on, its, socialist, principles, in, the, belief, that, this, would, achieve, electoral, success, he, wrote, i, find, that, the, proposition, often, reduces, itself, to, this, that, if, the, labour, party, would, drop, its, socialism, and, adopt, a, liberal, platform, many, liberals, would, be, pleased, to, support, it, i, have, heard, it, said, more, than, once, that, if, labour, would, only, drop, its, policy, of, nationalisation, everyone, would, be, pleased, and, it, would, soon, obtain, a, majority, i, am, convinced, it, would, be, fatal, for, the, labour, party, he, also, wrote, that, there, was, no, point, in, watering, down, labour, s, socialist, creed, in, order, to, attract, new, adherents, who, cannot, accept, the, full, socialist, faith, on, the, contrary, i, believe, that, it, is, only, a, clear, and, bold, policy, that, will, attract, this, support, in, the, late, 1930s, attlee, sponsored, a, jewish, mother, and, her, two, children, enabling, them, to, leave, germany, in, 1939, and, move, to, the, uk, on, arriving, in, britain, attlee, invited, one, of, the, children, into, his, home, in, stanmore, north, west, london, where, he, stayed, for, several, months, attlee, remained, as, leader, of, the, opposition, when, the, second, world, war, broke, out, in, september, 1939, the, ensuing, disastrous, norwegian, campaign, would, result, in, a, motion, of, no, confidence, in, neville, chamberlain, although, chamberlain, survived, this, the, reputation, of, his, administration, was, so, badly, and, publicly, damaged, that, it, became, clear, a, coalition, government, would, be, necessary, even, if, attlee, had, personally, been, prepared, to, serve, under, chamberlain, in, an, emergency, coalition, government, he, would, never, have, been, able, to, carry, labour, with, him, consequently, chamberlain, tendered, his, resignation, and, labour, and, the, conservatives, entered, a, coalition, government, led, by, winston, churchill, on, 10, may, 1940, with, attlee, joining, the, cabinet, as, lord, privy, seal, on, 12, may, attlee, and, churchill, quickly, agreed, that, the, war, cabinet, would, consist, of, three, conservatives, initially, churchill, chamberlain, and, lord, halifax, and, two, labour, members, initially, himself, and, arthur, greenwood, and, that, labour, should, have, slightly, more, than, one, third, of, the, posts, in, the, coalition, government, attlee, and, greenwood, played, a, vital, role, in, supporting, churchill, during, a, series, of, war, cabinet, debates, over, whether, or, not, to, negotiate, peace, terms, with, hitler, following, the, fall, of, france, in, may, 1940, both, supported, churchill, and, gave, him, the, majority, he, needed, in, the, war, cabinet, to, continue, britain, s, resistance, only, attlee, and, churchill, remained, in, the, war, cabinet, from, the, formation, of, the, government, of, national, unity, in, may, 1940, through, to, the, election, in, may, 1945, attlee, was, initially, the, lord, privy, seal, before, becoming, britain, s, first, ever, deputy, prime, minister, in, 1942, as, well, as, becoming, the, dominions, secretary, and, lord, president, of, the, council, on, 28, september, 1943, attlee, himself, played, a, generally, low, key, but, vital, role, in, the, wartime, government, working, behind, the, scenes, and, in, committees, to, ensure, the, smooth, operation, of, government, in, the, coalition, government, three, inter, connected, committees, effectively, ran, the, country, churchill, chaired, the, first, two, the, war, cabinet, and, the, defence, committee, with, attlee, deputising, for, him, in, these, and, answering, for, the, government, in, parliament, when, churchill, was, absent, attlee, himself, instituted, and, later, chaired, the, third, body, the, lord, president, s, committee, which, was, responsible, for, overseeing, domestic, affairs, as, churchill, was, most, concerned, with, overseeing, the, war, effort, this, arrangement, suited, both, men, attlee, himself, had, largely, been, responsible, for, creating, these, arrangements, with, churchill, s, backing, streamlining, the, machinery, of, government, and, abolishing, many, committees, he, also, acted, as, a, conciliator, in, the, government, smoothing, over, tensions, which, frequently, arose, between, labour, and, conservative, ministers, many, labour, activists, were, baffled, by, the, top, leadership, role, for, a, man, they, regarded, as, having, little, charisma, beatrice, webb, wrote, in, her, diary, in, early, 1940, following, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, and, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, in, may, 1945, attlee, and, churchill, favoured, the, coalition, government, remaining, in, place, until, japan, had, been, defeated, however, herbert, morrison, made, it, clear, that, the, labour, party, would, not, be, willing, to, accept, this, and, churchill, was, forced, to, tender, his, resignation, as, prime, minister, and, call, an, immediate, election, the, war, had, set, in, motion, profound, social, changes, within, britain, and, had, ultimately, led, to, a, widespread, popular, desire, for, social, reform, this, mood, was, epitomised, in, the, beveridge, report, of, 1942, by, the, liberal, economist, william, beveridge, the, report, assumed, that, the, maintenance, of, full, employment, would, be, the, aim, of, post, war, governments, and, that, this, would, provide, the, basis, for, the, welfare, state, immediately, upon, its, release, it, sold, hundreds, of, thousands, of, copies, all, major, parties, committed, themselves, to, fulfilling, this, aim, but, most, historians, say, that, attlee, s, labour, party, was, seen, by, the, electorate, as, the, party, most, likely, to, follow, it, through, labour, campaigned, on, the, theme, of, let, us, face, the, future, positioning, themselves, as, the, party, best, placed, to, rebuild, britain, following, the, war, and, were, widely, viewed, as, having, run, a, strong, and, positive, campaign, while, the, conservative, campaign, centred, entirely, on, churchill, despite, opinion, polls, indicating, a, strong, labour, lead, opinion, polls, were, then, viewed, as, a, novelty, which, had, not, proven, their, worth, and, most, commentators, expected, that, churchill, s, prestige, and, status, as, a, war, hero, would, ensure, a, comfortable, conservative, victory, before, polling, day, the, manchester, guardian, surmised, that, the, chances, of, labour, sweeping, the, country, and, obtaining, a, clear, majority, are, pretty, remote, the, news, of, the, world, predicted, a, working, conservative, majority, while, in, glasgow, a, pundit, forecast, the, result, as, conservatives, 360, labour, 220, others, 60, churchill, however, made, some, costly, errors, during, the, campaign, in, particular, his, suggestion, during, one, radio, broadcast, that, a, future, labour, government, would, require, some, form, of, a, gestapo, to, implement, their, policies, was, widely, regarded, as, being, in, very, bad, taste, and, massively, backfired, when, the, results, of, the, election, were, announced, on, 26, july, they, came, as, a, surprise, to, most, including, attlee, himself, labour, had, won, power, by, a, huge, landslide, winning, 47, 7, per, cent, of, the, vote, to, the, conservatives, 36, per, cent, this, gave, them, 393, seats, in, the, house, of, commons, a, working, majority, of, 146, this, was, the, first, time, in, history, that, the, labour, party, had, won, a, majority, in, parliament, when, attlee, went, to, see, king, george, vi, at, buckingham, palace, to, be, appointed, prime, minister, the, notoriously, laconic, attlee, and, the, famously, tongue, tied, king, stood, in, silence, attlee, finally, volunteered, the, remark, i, ve, won, the, election, the, king, replied, i, know, i, heard, it, on, the, six, o, clock, news, francis, 1995, argues, there, was, consensus, both, in, the, labour, s, national, executive, committee, and, at, party, conferences, on, a, definition, of, socialism, that, stressed, moral, improvement, as, well, as, material, improvement, the, attlee, government, was, committed, to, rebuilding, british, society, as, an, ethical, commonwealth, using, public, ownership, and, controls, to, abolish, extremes, of, wealth, and, poverty, labour, s, ideology, contrasted, sharply, with, the, contemporary, conservative, party, s, defence, of, individualism, inherited, privileges, and, income, inequality, on, 5, july, 1948, clement, attlee, replied, to, a, letter, dated, 22, june, from, james, murray, and, ten, other, mps, who, raised, concerns, about, west, indians, who, arrived, on, board, the, hmt, empire, windrush, as, for, the, prime, minister, himself, he, was, not, much, focused, on, economic, policy, letting, others, handle, the, issues, attlee, s, government, also, carried, out, their, manifesto, commitment, for, nationalisation, of, basic, industries, and, public, utilities, the, bank, of, england, and, civil, aviation, were, nationalised, in, 1946, coal, mining, the, railways, road, haulage, canals, and, cable, and, wireless, were, nationalised, in, 1947, and, electricity, and, gas, followed, in, 1948, the, steel, industry, was, nationalised, in, 1951, by, 1951, about, 20, per, cent, of, the, british, economy, had, been, taken, into, public, ownership, nationalisation, failed, to, provide, workers, with, a, greater, say, in, the, running, of, the, industries, in, which, they, worked, it, did, however, bring, about, significant, material, gains, for, workers, in, the, form, of, higher, wages, reduced, working, hours, and, improvements, in, working, conditions, especially, in, regards, to, safety, as, historian, eric, shaw, noted, of, the, years, following, nationalisation, the, electricity, and, gas, supply, companies, became, impressive, models, of, public, enterprise, in, terms, of, efficiency, and, the, national, coal, board, was, not, only, profitable, but, working, conditions, for, miners, had, significantly, improved, as, well, within, a, few, years, of, nationalisation, a, number, of, progressive, measures, had, been, carried, out, which, did, much, to, improve, conditions, in, the, mines, including, better, pay, a, five, day, working, week, a, national, safety, scheme, with, proper, standards, at, all, the, collieries, a, ban, on, boys, under, the, age, of, 16, going, underground, the, introduction, of, training, for, newcomers, before, going, down, to, the, coalface, and, the, making, of, pithead, baths, into, a, standard, facility, the, newly, established, national, coal, board, offered, sick, pay, and, holiday, pay, to, miners, as, noted, by, martin, francis, union, leaders, saw, nationalisation, as, a, means, to, pursue, a, more, advantageous, position, within, a, framework, of, continued, conflict, rather, than, as, an, opportunity, to, replace, the, old, adversarial, form, of, industrial, relations, moreover, most, workers, in, nationalised, industries, exhibited, an, essentially, instrumentalist, attitude, favouring, public, ownership, because, it, secured, job, security, and, improved, wages, rather, than, because, it, promised, the, creation, of, a, new, set, of, socialist, relationships, in, the, workplace, attlee, s, health, minister, aneurin, bevan, fought, hard, against, the, general, disapproval, of, the, medical, establishment, including, the, british, medical, association, by, creating, the, national, health, service, in, 1948, this, was, a, publicly, funded, healthcare, system, which, offered, treatment, for, all, regardless, of, income, free, of, charge, at, the, point, of, use, reflecting, pent, up, demand, that, had, long, existed, for, medical, services, the, nhs, treated, some, 8, 5, million, dental, patients, and, dispensed, more, than, 5, million, pairs, of, spectacles, during, its, first, year, of, operation, consultants, benefited, from, the, new, system, by, being, paid, salaries, that, provided, an, acceptable, standard, of, living, without, the, need, for, them, to, resort, to, private, practice, the, nhs, brought, major, improvements, in, the, health, of, working, class, people, with, deaths, from, diphtheria, pneumonia, and, tuberculosis, significantly, reduced, although, there, were, often, disputes, about, its, organisation, and, funding, british, political, parties, continued, to, voice, their, general, support, for, the, nhs, in, order, to, remain, electable, in, the, field, of, health, care, funds, were, allocated, to, modernisation, and, extension, schemes, aimed, at, improving, administrative, efficiency, improvements, were, made, in, nursing, accommodation, in, order, to, recruit, more, nurses, and, reduce, labour, shortages, which, were, keeping, 60, 000, beds, out, of, use, and, efforts, were, made, to, reduce, the, imbalance, between, an, excess, of, fever, and, tuberculosis, tb, beds, and, a, shortage, of, maternity, beds, bcg, vaccinations, were, introduced, for, the, protection, of, medical, students, midwives, nurses, and, contacts, of, patients, with, tuberculosis, a, pension, scheme, was, set, up, for, employees, of, the, newly, established, nhs, the, national, health, service, superannuation, regulations, 1947, laid, down, a, number, of, provisions, for, beneficiaries, including, an, officer, s, pension, and, retiring, allowance, an, injury, allowance, a, short, service, gratuity, a, death, gratuity, a, widow, s, pension, and, supplementary, payments, in, the, case, of, special, classes, of, officers, provision, was, also, made, for, the, allocation, of, part, of, pension, or, injury, allowance, to, spouse, of, dependent, the, radioactive, substances, act, 1948, set, out, general, provisions, to, control, radioactive, substances, numerous, lesser, reforms, were, also, introduced, some, of, which, were, of, great, benefit, to, certain, segments, of, british, society, such, as, the, mentally, deficient, and, the, blind, between, 1948, and, 1951, attlee, s, government, increased, spending, on, health, from, 6, billion, to, 11, billion, an, increase, of, over, 80, and, from, 2, 1, to, 3, 6, of, gdp, the, government, set, about, implementing, the, wartime, plans, of, william, beveridge, s, plans, for, the, creation, of, a, cradle, to, grave, welfare, state, and, set, in, place, an, entirely, new, system, of, social, security, among, the, most, important, pieces, of, legislation, was, the, national, insurance, act, 1946, in, which, people, in, work, paid, a, flat, rate, of, national, insurance, in, return, they, and, the, wives, of, male, contributors, were, eligible, for, flat, rate, pensions, sickness, benefit, unemployment, benefit, and, funeral, benefit, various,

government, s, health, and, welfare, policies, was, such, that, all, the, indices, of, health, such, as, statistics, of, school, medical, or, dental, officers, or, of, medical, officers, of, health, showed, signs, of, improvement, with, continual, improvements, in, survival, rates, for, infants, and, increased, life, expectancy, for, the, elderly, the, success, of, the, attlee, government, s, welfare, legislation, in, reducing, poverty, was, such, that, in, the, general, election, of, 1950, according, to, one, study, labour, propaganda, could, make, much, of, the, claim, that, social, security, had, eradicated, the, most, abject, destitution, of, the, 1930s, the, attlee, government, ensured, provisions, of, the, education, act, 1944, were, fully, implemented, with, free, secondary, education, becoming, a, right, for, the, first, time, fees, in, state, grammar, schools, were, eliminated, while, new, modern, secondary, schools, were, constructed, the, school, leaving, age, was, raised, to, 15, in, 1947, an, accomplishment, helped, brought, into, fruition, by, initiatives, such, as, the, horsa, huts, operation, for, raising, the, school, leaving, age, scheme, and, the, s, f, o, r, s, a, furniture, scheme, university, scholarships, were, introduced, to, ensure, that, no, one, who, was, qualified, should, be, deprived, of, a, university, education, for, financial, reasons, while, a, large, school, building, programme, was, organised, a, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, trained, teachers, took, place, and, the, number, of, new, school, places, was, increased,

were, not, in, full, time, education, an, emergency, training, scheme, was, also, introduced, which, turned, out, an, extra, 25, 000, teachers, in, 1945, 1951, in, 1947, regional, advisory, councils, were, set, up, to, bring, together, industry, and, education, to, find, out, the, needs, of, young, workers, and, advise, on, the, provision, required, and, to, secure, reasonable, economy, of, provision, that, same, year, thirteen, area, training, organisations, were, set, up, in, england, and, one, in, wales, to, coordinate, teacher, training, attlee, s, government, however, failed, to, introduce, the, comprehensive, education, for, which, many, socialists, had, hoped, this, reform, was, eventually, carried, out, by, harold, wilson, s, government, during, its, time, in, office, the, attlee, government, increased, spending, on, education, by, over, 50, per, cent, from, 6, 5, billion, to, 10, billion, the, most, significant, problem, facing, attlee, and, his, ministers, remained, the, economy, as, the, war, effort, had, left, britain, nearly, bankrupt, overseas, investments, had, been, used, up, to, pay, for, the, war, the, transition, to, a, peacetime, economy, and, the, maintaining, of, strategic, military, commitments, abroad, led, to, continuous, and, severe, problems, with, the, balance, of, trade, this, resulted, in, strict, rationing, of, food, and, other, essential, goods, continuing, in, the, post, war, period, to, force, a, reduction, in, consumption, in, an, effort, to, limit, imports, boost, exports, and, stabilise, the, pound, sterling, so, that, britain, could, trade, its, way, out, of, its, financial, state, the, abrupt, end, of, the, american, lend, lease, programme, in, august, 1945, almost, caused, a, crisis, some, relief, was, provided, by, the, anglo, american, loan, negotiated, in, december, 1945, the, conditions, attached, to, the, loan, included, making, the, pound, fully, convertible, to, the, us, dollar, when, this, was, introduced, in, july, 1947, it, led, to, a, currency, crisis, and, convertibility, had, to, be, suspended, after, just, five, weeks, the, uk, benefited, from, the, american, marshall, aid, program, in, 1948, and, the, economic, situation, improved, significantly, another, balance, of, payments, crisis, in, 1949, forced, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, stafford, cripps, into, devaluation, of, the, pound, despite, these, problems, one, of, the, main, achievements, of, attlee, s, government, was, the, maintenance, of, near, full, employment, the, government, maintained, most, of, the, wartime, controls, over, the, economy, including, control, over, the, allocation, of, materials, and, manpower, and, unemployment, rarely, rose, above, 500, 000, or, 3, per, cent, of, the, total, workforce, labour, shortages, proved, a, more, frequent, problem, the, inflation, rate, was, also, kept, low, during, his, term, the, rate, of, unemployment, rarely, rose, above, 2, per, cent, during, attlee, s, time, in, office, whilst, there, was, no, hard, core, of, long, term, unemployed, both, production, and, productivity, rose, as, a, result, of, new, equipment, while, the, average, working, week, was, shortened, the, government, was, less, successful, in, housing, which, was, the, responsibility, of, aneurin, bevan, the, government, had, a, target, to, build, 400, 000, new, houses, a, year, to, replace, those, which, had, been, destroyed, in, the, war, but, shortages, of, materials, and, manpower, meant, that, less, than, half, this, number, were, built, nevertheless, millions, of, people, were, rehoused, as, a, result, of, the, attlee, government, s, housing, policies, between, august, 1945, and, december, 1951, 1, 016, 349, new, homes, were, completed, in, england, scotland, and, wales, when, the, attlee, government, was, voted, out, of, office, in, 1951, the, economy, had, been, improved, compared, to, 1945, the, period, from, 1946, to, 1951, saw, continuous, full, employment, and, steadily, rising, living, standards, which, increased, by, about, 10, per, cent, each, year, during, that, same, period, the, economy, grew, by, 3, per, cent, a, year, and, by, 1951, the, uk, had, the, best, economic, performance, in, europe, while, output, per, person, was, increasing, faster, than, in, the, united, states, careful, planning, after, 1945, also, ensured, that, demobilisation, was, carried, out, without, having, a, negative, impact, upon, economic, recovery, and, that, unemployment, stayed, at, very, low, levels, in, addition, the, number, of, motor, cars, on, the, roads, rose, from, 3, million, to, 5, million, from, 1945, to, 1951, and, seaside, holidays, were, taken, by, far, more, people, than, ever, before, a, monopolies, and, restrictive, practices, inquiry, and, control, act, was, passed, in, 1948, which, allowed, for, investigations, of, restrictive, practices, and, monopolies, however, some, economic, historians, have, argued, that, the, uk, failed, to, develop, economically, after, the, war, with, failure, to, support, industry, leaving, the, economy, not, recovering, as, effectively, as, germany, 1947, proved, a, particularly, difficult, year, for, the, government, an, exceptionally, cold, winter, that, year, caused, coal, mines, to, freeze, and, cease, production, creating, widespread, power, cuts, and, food, shortages, the, minister, of, fuel, and, power, emanuel, shinwell, was, widely, blamed, for, failing, to, ensure, adequate, coal, stocks, and, soon, resigned, from, his, post, the, conservatives, capitalised, on, the, crisis, with, the, slogan, starve, with, strachey, and, shiver, with, shinwell, referring, to, the, minister, of, food, john, strachey, the, crisis, led, to, an, unsuccessful, plot, by, hugh, dalton, to, replace, attlee, as, prime, minister, with, ernest, bevin, later, that, year, stafford, cripps, tried, to, persuade, attlee, to, stand, aside, for, bevin, these, plots, petered, out, after, bevin, refused, to, cooperate, later, that, year, dalton, resigned, as, chancellor, after, inadvertently, leaking, details, of, the, budget, to, a, journalist, he, was, replaced, by, cripps, in, foreign, affairs, the, attlee, government, was, concerned, with, four, main, issues, post, war, europe, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, the, establishment, of, the, united, nations, and, decolonisation, the, first, two, were, closely, related, and, attlee, was, assisted, by, foreign, secretary, ernest, bevin, attlee, also, attended, the, later, stages, of, the, potsdam, conference, where, he, negotiated, with, president, harry, s, truman, and, joseph, stalin, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, war, the, government, faced, the, challenge, of, managing, relations, with, britain, s, former, war, time, ally, stalin, and, the, soviet, union, ernest, bevin, was, a, passionate, anti, communist, based, largely, on, his, experience, of, fighting, communist, influence, in, the, trade, union, movement, bevin, s, initial, approach, to, the, ussr, as, foreign, secretary, was, wary, and, suspicious, but, not, automatically, hostile, attlee, himself, sought, warm, relations, with, stalin, he, put, his, trust, in, the, united, nations, rejected, notions, that, the, soviet, union, was, bent, on, world, conquest, and, warned, that, treating, moscow, as, an, enemy, would, turn, it, into, one, this, put, attlee, at, sword, s, point, with, his, foreign, minister, the, foreign, office, and, the, military, who, all, saw, the, soviets, as, a, growing, threat, to, britain, s, role, in, the, middle, east, suddenly, in, january, 1947, attlee, reversed, his, position, and, agreed, with, bevin, on, a, hardline, anti, soviet, policy, in, an, early, good, will, gesture, that, was, later, heavily, criticised, the, attlee, government, allowed, the, soviets, to, purchase, under, the, terms, of, a, 1946, uk, ussr, trade, agreement, a, total, of, 25, rolls, royce, nene, jet, engines, in, september, 1947, and, march, 1948, the, agreement, included, an, agreement, not, to, use, them, for, military, purposes, the, price, was, fixed, under, a, commercial, contract, a, total, of, 55, jet, engines, were, sold, to, the, ussr, in, 1947, however, the, cold, war, intensified, during, this, period, and, the, soviets, who, at, the, time, were, well, behind, the, west, in, jet, technology, reverse, engineered, the, nene, and, installed, their, own, version, in, the, mig, 15, interceptor, this, was, used, to, good, effect, against, us, uk, forces, in, the, subsequent, korean, war, as, well, as, in, several, later, mig, models, after, stalin, took, political, control, of, most, of, eastern, europe, and, began, to, subvert, other, governments, in, the, balkans, attlee, s, and, bevin, s, worst, fears, of, soviet, intentions, were, realised, the, attlee, government, then, became, instrumental, in, the, creation, of, the, successful, nato, defence, alliance, to, protect, western, europe, against, any, soviet, expansion, in, a, crucial, contribution, to, the, economic, stability, of, post, war, europe, attlee, s, cabinet, was, instrumental, in, promoting, the, american, marshall, plan, for, the, economic, recovery, of, europe, he, called, it, one, of, the, most, bold, enlightened, and, good, natured, acts, in, the, history, of, nations, a, group, of, labour, mps, organised, under, the, banner, of, keep, left, urged, the, government, to, steer, a, middle, way, between, the, two, emerging, superpowers, and, advocated, the, creation, of, a, third, force, of, european, powers, to, stand, between, the, us, and, ussr, however, deteriorating, relations, between, britain, and, the, ussr, as, well, as, britain, s, economic, reliance, on, america, following, the, marshall, plan, steered, policy, towards, supporting, the, us, in, january, 1947, fear, of, both, soviet, and, american, nuclear, intentions, led, to, a, secret, meeting, of, the, cabinet, where, the, decision, was, made, to, press, ahead, with, the, development, of, britain, s, independent, nuclear, deterrent, an, issue, which, later, caused, a, split, in, the, labour, party, britain, s, first, successful, nuclear, test, however, did, not, occur, until, 1952, one, year, after, attlee, had, left, office, the, london, dock, strike, of, july, 1949, led, by, communists, was, suppressed, when, the, attlee, government, sent, in, 13, 000, army, troops, and, passed, special, legislation, to, promptly, end, the, strike, his, response, reveals, attlee, s, growing, concern, that, soviet, expansionism, supported, by, the, british, communist, party, was, a, genuine, threat, to, national, security, and, that, the, docks, were, highly, vulnerable, to, sabotage, ordered, by, moscow, he, noted, that, the, strike, was, caused, not, by, local, grievances, but, to, help, communist, unions, who, were, on, strike, in, canada, attlee, agreed, with, mi5, that, he, faced, a, very, present, menace, decolonisation, was, never, a, major, election, issue, but, attlee, gave, the, matter, a, great, deal, of, attention, and, was, the, chief, leader, in, beginning, the, process, of, decolonisation, of, the, british, empire, in, august, 1948, the, chinese, communists, victories, caused, attlee, to, begin, preparing, for, a, communist, takeover, of, china, it, kept, open, consulates, in, communist, controlled, areas, and, rejected, the, chinese, nationalists, requests, that, british, citizens, assist, in, the, defence, of, shanghai, by, december, the, government, concluded, that, although, british, property, in, china, would, likely, be, nationalised, british, traders, would, benefit, in, the, long, run, from, a, stable, industrialising, communist, china, retaining, hong, kong, was, especially, important, to, him, although, the, chinese, communists, promised, to, not, interfere, with, its, rule, britain, reinforced, the, hong, kong, garrison, during, 1949, when, the, victorious, chinese, communists, government, declared, on, 1, october, 1949, that, it, would, exchange, diplomats, with, any, country, that, ended, relations, with, the, chinese, nationalists, britain, became, the, first, western, country, to, formally, recognise, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, january, 1950, in, 1954, a, labour, party, delegation, including, attlee, visited, china, at, the, invitation, of, then, foreign, minister, zhou, enlai, attlee, became, the, first, high, ranking, western, politician, to, meet, mao, zedong, attlee, orchestrated, the, granting, of, independence, to, india, and, pakistan, in, 1947, attlee, in, 1928, 1934, had, been, a, member, of, the, indian, statutory, commission, otherwise, known, as, the, simon, commission, he, became, the, labour, party, expert, on, india, and, by, 1934, was, committed, to, granting, india, the, same, independent, dominion, status, that, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, had, recently, been, given, he, faced, strong, resistance, from, the, die, hard, conservative, imperialists, led, by, churchill, who, opposed, both, independence, and, efforts, led, by, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, to, set, up, a, system, of, limited, local, control, by, indians, themselves, attlee, and, the, labour, leadership, were, sympathetic, to, both, the, congress, led, by, jawaharlal, nehru, and, the, pakistan, movement, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, during, the, second, world, war, attlee, was, in, charge, of, indian, affairs, he, set, up, the, cripps, mission, in, 1942, which, tried, and, failed, to, bring, the, factions, together, when, congress, called, for, passive, resistance, in, the, quit, india, movement, of, 1942, 1945, it, was, the, british, regime, ordered, the, widespread, arrest, and, internment, for, the, duration, of, tens, of, thousands, of, congress, leaders, as, part, of, its, efforts, to, crush, the, revolt, labour, s, election, manifesto, in, 1945, called, for, the, advancement, of, india, to, responsible, self, government, in, 1942, the, british, raj, tried, to, enlist, all, major, political, parties, in, support, of, the, war, effort, congress, led, by, nehru, and, gandhi, demanded, immediate, independence, and, full, control, by, congress, of, all, of, india, that, demand, was, rejected, by, the, british, and, congress, opposed, the, war, effort, with, its, quit, india, campaign, the, raj, immediately, responded, in, 1942, by, imprisoning, the, major, national, regional, and, local, congress, leaders, for, the, duration, attlee, did, not, object, by, contrast, the, muslim, league, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, strongly, supported, the, war, effort, they, greatly, enlarged, their, membership, and, won, favour, from, london, for, their, decision, attlee, retained, a, fondness, for, congress, and, until, 1946, accepted, their, thesis, that, they, were, a, non, religious, party, that, accepted, hindus, muslims, sikhs, and, everyone, else, nevertheless, this, difference, in, opinion, between, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, towards, the, british, war, effort, encouraged, attlee, and, his, government, to, consider, further, negotiations, with, the, muslim, league, the, muslim, league, insisted, that, it, was, the, only, true, representative, of, all, of, the, muslims, of, india, with, violence, escalating, in, india, after, the, war, but, with, british, financial, power, at, a, low, ebb, large, scale, military, involvement, was, impossible, viceroy, wavell, said, he, needed, a, further, seven, army, divisions, to, prevent, communal, violence, if, independence, negotiations, failed, no, divisions, were, available, independence, was, the, only, option, given, the, increasing, demands, of, the, muslim, league, independence, implied, a, partition, that, set, off, heavily, muslim, pakistan, from, the, main, portion, of, india, after, becoming, prime, minister, in, 1945, attlee, originally, planned, to, give, india, dominion, status, in, 1948, attlee, suggested, in, his, memoirs, that, traditional, colonial, rule, in, asia, was, no, longer, viable, he, said, that, he, expected, it, to, meet, renewed, opposition, after, the, war, both, by, local, national, movements, as, well, as, by, the, united, states, the, prime, minister, s, biographer, john, bew, says, that, attlee, hoped, for, a, transition, to, a, multilateral, world, order, and, a, commonwealth, and, that, the, old, british, empire, should, not, be, supported, beyond, its, natural, lifespan, and, instead, be, ended, on, the, right, note, his, exchequer, hugh, dalton, meanwhile, feared, that, post, war, britain, could, no, longer, afford, to, garrison, its, empire, ultimately, the, labour, government, gave, full, independence, to, india, and, pakistan, in, 1947, through, the, indian, independence, act, this, involved, creating, a, demarcation, between, the, two, regions, which, was, known, as, the, radcliffe, line, the, boundary, between, the, newly, created, states, of, pakistan, and, india, involved, the, widespread, resettlement, of, millions, of, hindus, sikhs, and, muslims, almost, immediately, extreme, anti, hindu, and, anti, sikh, violence, ensued, in, lahore, multan, and, dacca, when, the, punjab, province, and, the, bengal, province, were, split, in, the, partition, of, india, this, was, followed, by, a, rapid, increase, in, widespread, anti, muslim, violence, in, several, areas, including, amritsar, rajkot, jaipur, calcutta, and, delhi, historian, yasmin, khan, estimates, that, over, a, million, people, were, killed, of, which, several, were, women, and, children, gandhi, himself, was, assassinated, in, january, 1948, attlee, remarked, gandhi, as, the, greatest, citizen, of, india, and, added, this, one, man, has, been, the, major, factor, in, every, consideration, of, the, indian, problem, he, had, become, the, expression, of, the, aspirations, of, the, indian, people, for, independence, historian, andrew, roberts, says, the, independence, of, india, was, a, national, humiliation, but, it, was, necessitated, by, urgent, financial, administrative, strategic, and, political, needs, churchill, in, 1940, 1945, had, tightened, the, hold, on, india, and, imprisoned, the, congress, leadership, with, attlee, s, approval, labour, had,

as, fellow, idealistic, socialists, by, labour, leaders, attlee, was, the, labour, expert, on, india, and, took, special, charge, of, decolonisation, attlee, found, that, churchill, s, viceroy, field, marshal, wavell, was, too, imperialistic, too, keen, on, military, solutions, and, too, neglectful, of, indian, political, alignments, the, eventual, appointee, for, new, viceroy, lord, mountbatten, the, dashing, war, hero, and, a, cousin, of, the, king, was, put, forward, by, v, k, krishna, menon, as, a, candidate, acceptable, to, all, in, a, series, of, clandestine, meetings, with, sir, stafford, scripps, and, with, attlee, attlee, also, sponsored, the, peaceful, transition, to, independence, in, 1948, of, burma, myanmar, and, ceylon, sri, lanka, one, of, the, most, urgent, problems, facing, attlee, concerned, the, future, of, the, british, mandate, in, palestine, which, had, become, too, troublesome, and, expensive, to, handle, british, policies, in, palestine, were, perceived, by, the, zionist, movement, and, the, truman, administration, to, be, pro, arab, and, anti, jewish, and, britain, soon, found, itself, unable, to, maintain, public, order, in, the, face, of, a, jewish, insurgency, and, a, civil, war, during, this, period, 70, 000, holocaust, survivors, attempted, to, reach, palestine, as, part, of, the, aliyah, bet, refugee, movement, attlee, s, government, tried, several, tactics, to, prevent, the, migration, five, ships, were, bombed, by, the, secret, intelligence, service, though, with, no, casualties, with, a, fake, palestinian, group, created, to, take, responsibility, the, navy, apprehended, over, 50, 000, refugees, en, route, interning, them, in, detention, camps, in, cyprus, conditions, in, the, camps, were, harsh, and, faced, global, criticism, later, the, refugee, ship, exodus, 1947, would, be, sent, back, to, mainland, europe, instead, of, being, taken, to, cyprus, in, response, to, the, increasingly, unpopular, mandate, attlee, ordered, the, evacuation, of, all, british, military, personnel, and, handed, over, the, issue, to, the, united, nations, a, decision, which, was, widely, supported, by, the, general, public, in, britain, with, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, in, 1948, the, camps, in, cyprus, were, eventually, closed, with, their, former, occupants, finally, completing, their, journey, to, the, new, country, the, government, s, policies, with, regard, to, the, other, colonies, particularly, those, in, africa, focused, on, keeping, them, as, strategic, cold, war, assets, while, modernising, their, economies, the, labour, party, had, long, attracted, aspiring, leaders, from, africa, and, had, developed, elaborate, plans, before, the, war, implementing, them, overnight, with, an, empty, treasury, proved, too, challenging, a, major, military, base, was, built, in, kenya, and, the, african, colonies, came, under, an, unprecedented, degree, of, direct, control, from, london, development, schemes, were, implemented, to, help, solve, britain, s, post, war, balance, of, payments, crisis, and, raise, african, living, standards, this, new, colonialism, worked, slowly, and, had, failures, such, as, the, tanganyika, groundnut, scheme, the, 1950, election, gave, labour, a, massively, reduced, majority, of, five, seats, compared, to, the, triple, digit, majority, of, 1945, although, re, elected, the, result, was, seen, by, attlee, as, very, disappointing, and, was, widely, attributed, to, the, effects, of, post, war, austerity, denting, labour, s, appeal, to, middle, class, voters, with, such, a, small, majority, leaving, him, dependent, on, a, small, number, of, mps, to, govern, attlee, s, second, term, was, much, tamer, than, his, first, some, major, reforms, were, nevertheless, passed, particularly, regarding, industry, in, urban, areas, and, regulations, to, limit, air, and, water, pollution, by, 1951, the, attlee, government, was, exhausted, with, several, of, its, most, senior, ministers, ailing, or, ageing, and, with, a, lack, of, new, ideas, attlee, s, record, for, settling, internal, differences, in, the, labour, party, fell, in, april, 1951, when, there, was, a, damaging, split, over, an, austerity, budget, brought, in, by, the, chancellor, hugh, gaitskell, to, pay, for, the, cost, of, britain, s, participation, in, the, korean, war, aneurin, bevan, resigned, to, protest, against, the, new, charges, for, teeth, and, spectacles, in, the, national, health, service, introduced, by, that, budget, and, was, joined, in, this, action, by, several, senior, ministers, including, the, future, prime, minister, harold, wilson, then, the, president, of, the, board, of, trade, thus, escalated, a, battle, between, the, left, and, right, wings, of, the, party, that, continues, today, finding, it, increasingly, impossible, to, govern, attlee, s, only, chance, was, to, call, a, snap, election, in, october, 1951, in, the, hope, of, achieving, a, more, workable, majority, and, to, regain, authority, the, gamble, failed, labour, narrowly, lost, to, the, conservative, party, despite, winning, considerably, more, votes, achieving, the, largest, labour, vote, in, electoral, history, attlee, tendered, his, resignation, as, prime, minister, the, following, day, after, six, years, and, three, months, in, office, following, the, defeat, in, 1951, attlee, continued, to, lead, the, party, as, leader, of, the, opposition, his, last, four, years, as, leader, were, however, widely, seen, as, one, of, the, labour, party, s, weaker, periods, the, period, was, dominated, by, infighting, between, the, labour, party, s, right, wing, led, by, hugh, gaitskell, and, its, left, led, by, aneurin, bevan, many, labour, mps, felt, that, attlee, should, have, retired, following, 1951, election, and, allowed, a, younger, man, to, lead, the, party, bevan, openly, called, for, him, to, stand, down, in, the, summer, of, 1954, one, of, his, main, reasons, for, staying, on, as, leader, was, to, frustrate, the, leadership, ambitions, of, herbert, morrison, whom, attlee, disliked, for, both, political, and, personal, reasons, at, one, time, attlee, had, favoured, aneurin, bevan, to, succeed, him, as, leader, but, this, became, problematic, after, bevan, almost, irrevocably, split, the, party, attlee, now, aged, 72, contested, the, 1955, general, election, against, anthony, eden, which, saw, labour, lose, 18, seats, and, the, conservatives, increase, their, majority, in, an, interview, with, the, news, chronicle, columnist, percy, cudlipp, in, mid, september, 1955, attlee, made, clear, his, own, thinking, together, with, his, preference, for, the, leadership, succession, stating, labour, has, nothing, to, gain, by, dwelling, in, the, past, nor, do, i, think, we, can, impress, the, nation, by, adopting, a, futile, left, wingism, i, regard, myself, as, left, of, centre, which, is, where, a, party, leader, ought, to, be, it, is, no, use, asking, what, would, keir, hardie, have, done, we, must, have, at, the, top, men, brought, up, in, the, present, age, not, as, i, was, in, the, victorian, age, he, retired, as, leader, of, the, labour, party, on, 7, december, 1955, having, led, the, party, for, twenty, years, and, on, 14, december, hugh, gaitskell, was, elected, as, his, successor, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a,

peerage, as, earl, attlee, and, viscount, prestwood, on, 16, december, 1955, taking, his, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, on, 25, january, he, believed, eden, had, been, forced, into, taking, a, strong, stand, on, the, suez, crisis, by, his, backbenchers, in, 1958, attlee, along, with, numerous, notables, established, the, homosexual, law, reform, society, this, campaigned, for, the, decriminalisation, of, homosexual, acts, in, private, by, consenting, adults, a, reform, that, was, voted, through, parliament, nine, years, later, in, may, 1961, he, travelled, to, washington, d, c, to, meet, with, president, kennedy, in, 1962, he, spoke, twice, in, the, house, of, lords, against, the, british, government, s, application, for, the, uk, to, join, the, european, communities, common, market, in, his, second, speech, delivered, in, november, attlee, claimed, that, britain, had, a, separate, parliamentary, tradition, from, the, continental, european, countries, that, comprised, the, ec, he, also, claimed, that, if, britain, became, a, member, ec, rules, would, prevent, the, british, government, from, planning, the, economy, and, that, britain, s, traditional, policy, had, been, outward, looking, rather, than, continental, he, attended, winston, churchill, s, funeral, in, january, 1965, he, was, frail, by, that, time, and, had, to, remain, seated, in, the, freezing, cold, as, the, coffin, was, carried, having, tired, himself, out, by, standing, at, the, rehearsal, the, previous, day, he, lived, to, see, the, labour, party, return, to, power, under, harold, wilson, in, 1964, and, also, to, see, his, old, constituency, of, walthamstow, west, fall, to, the, conservatives, in, a, by, election, in, september, 1967, attlee, died, peacefully, in, his, sleep, of, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 84, at, westminster, hospital, on, 8, october, 1967, two, thousand, people, attended, his, funeral, in, november, including, the, then, prime, minister, harold,

richard, attlee, 2nd, earl, attlee, 1927, 1991, who, defected, from, labour, to, the, sdp, in, 1981, it, is, now, held, by, clement, attlee, s, grandson, john, richard, attlee, 3rd, earl, attlee, the, third, earl, a, member, of, the, conservative, party, retained, his, seat, in, the, lords, as, one, of, the, hereditary, peers, to, remain, under, an, amendment, to, labour, s, house, of, lords, act, 1999, attlee, s, estate, was, sworn, for, probate, purposes, at, a, value, of, 7, 295, equivalent, to, 167, 246, in, 2023, a, relatively, modest, sum, for, so, prominent, a, figure, and, only, a, fraction, of, the, 75, 394, in, his, father, s, estate, when, he, died, in, 1908, the, quotation, about, attlee, a, modest, man, but, then, he, has, so, much, to, be, modest, about, is, commonly, ascribed, to, churchill, though, churchill, denied, saying, it, and, respected, attlee, s, service, in, the, war, cabinet, attlee, s, modesty, and, quiet, manner, hid, a, great, deal, that, has, only, come, to, light, with, historical, reappraisal, attlee, himself, is, said, to, have, responded, to, critics, with, a, limerick, there, were, few, who, thought, him, a, starter, many, who, thought, themselves, smarter, but, he, ended, pm, ch, and, om, an, earl, and, a, knight, of, the, garter, his, leadership, style, of, consensual, government, acting, as, a, chairman, rather, than, a, president, won, him, much, praise, from, historians, and, politicians, alike, christopher, soames, the, british, ambassador, to, france, during, the, conservative, government, of, edward, heath, and, cabinet, minister, under, margaret, thatcher, remarked, that, mrs, thatcher, was, not, really, running, a, team, every, time, you, have, a, prime, minister, who, wants, to, make, all, the, decisions, it, mainly, leads, to, bad, results, attlee, didn, t, that, s, why, he, was, so, damn, good, the, journalist, and, broadcaster, anthony, howard, called, him, the, greatest, prime, minister, of, the, 20th, century, thatcher, herself, wrote, in, her, 1995, memoirs, which, charted, her, life, from, her, beginnings, in, grantham, to, her, victory, at, the, 1979, general, election, that, she, admired, attlee, writing, of, clement, attlee, however, i, was, an, admirer, he, was, a, serious, man, and, a, patriot, quite, contrary, to, the, general, tendency, of, politicians, in, the, 1990s, he, was, all, substance, and, no, show, attlee, s, government, presided, over, the, successful, transition, from, a, wartime, economy, to, peacetime, tackling, problems, of, demobilisation, shortages, of, foreign, currency, and, adverse, deficits, in, trade, balances, and, government, expenditure, further, domestic, policies, that, he, brought, about, included, the, creation, of, the, national, health, service, and, the, post, war, welfare, state, which, became, key, to, the, reconstruction, of, post, war, britain, attlee, and, his, ministers, did, much, to, transform, the, uk, into, a, more, prosperous, and, egalitarian, society, during, their, time, in, office, with, reductions, in, poverty, and, a, rise, in, the, general, economic, security, of, the, population, in, foreign, affairs, he, did, much, to, assist, with, the, post, war, economic, recovery, of, europe, he, proved, a, loyal, ally, of, the, us, at, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, due, to, his, style, of, leadership, it, was, not, he, but, ernest, bevin, who, masterminded, foreign, policy, it, was, attlee, s, government, that, decided, britain, should, have, an, independent, nuclear, weapons, programme, and, work, on, it, began, in, 1947, bevin, attlee, s, foreign, secretary, famously, stated, that, we, ve, got, to, have, it, and, it, s, got, to, have, a, bloody, union, jack, on, it, the, first, operational, british, nuclear, bomb, was, not, detonated, until, october, 1952, about, one, year, after, attlee, had, left, office, independent, british, atomic, research, was, prompted, partly, by, the, us, mcmahon, act, which, nullified, wartime, expectations, of, postwar, us, uk, collaboration, in, nuclear, research, and, prohibited, americans, from, communicating, nuclear, technology, even, to, allied, countries, british, atomic, bomb, research, was, kept, secret, even, from, some, members, of, attlee, s, own, cabinet, whose, loyalty, or, discretion, seemed, uncertain, although, a, socialist, attlee, still, believed, in, the, british, empire, of, his, youth, he, thought, of, it, as, an, institution, that, was, a, power, for, good, in, the, world, nevertheless, he, saw, that, a, large, part, of, it, needed, to, be, self, governing, using, the, dominions, of, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, as, a, model, he, continued, the, transformation, of, the, empire, into, the, modern, day, british, commonwealth, his, greatest, achievement, surpassing, many, of, these, was, perhaps, the, establishment, of, a, political, and, economic, consensus, about, the, governance, of, britain, that, all, three, major, parties, subscribed, to, for, three, decades, fixing, the, arena, of, political, discourse, until, the, late, 1970s, in, 2004, he, was, voted, the, most, successful, british, prime, minister, of, the, 20th, century, by, a, poll, of, 139, academics, organised, by, ipsos, mori, a, blue, plaque, unveiled, in, 1979, commemorates, attlee, at, 17, monkhams, avenue, in,

last, surviving, member, of, attlee, s, cabinet, and, the, unveiling, of, the, statue, would, be, one, of, the, last, public, appearances, by, wilson, who, was, by, that, point, in, the, early, stages, of, alzheimer, s, disease, he, died, at, the, age, of, 79, in, may, 1995, limehouse, library, was, closed, in, 2003, after, which, the, statue, was, vandalised, the, council, surrounded, it,

anglicans, with, one, of, his, brothers, becoming, a, clergyman, and, one, of, his, sisters, a, missionary, attlee, himself, is, usually, regarded, as, an, agnostic, in, an, interview, he, described, himself, as, incapable, of, religious, feeling, saying, that, he, believed, in, the, ethics, of, christianity, but, not, the, mumbo, jumbo, when, asked, whether, he, was, an, agnostic, attlee,
