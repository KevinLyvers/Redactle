nevertheless, characterized, by, singular, inconsistencies, prioritizing, plunder, over, killing, showing, leniency, toward, most, jews, in, the, old, kingdom, and, ultimately, refusing, to, adopt, the, final, solution, this, was, made, possible, by, the, fact, that, romania, as, a, junior, ally, of, nazi, germany, was, not, occupied, by, the, wehrmacht, and, preserved, a, degree, of, political, autonomy, aerial, attacks, on, romania, by, the, allies, in, 1944, and, heavy, casualties, on, the, eastern, front, prompted, antonescu, to, open, peace, negotiations, with, the, allies, which, were,

i, and, his, regents, and, with, carol, s, seizure, of, power, in, 1930, during, this, period, antonescu, first, grew, interested, in, the, iron, guard, an, antisemitic, and, fascist, related, movement, headed, by, corneliu, zelea, codreanu, in, his, capacity, as, deputy, chief, of, staff, he, ordered, the, army, s, intelligence, unit, to, compile, a, report, on, the, faction, and, made, a,

provoking, indignation, among, sections, of, the, political, mainstream, on, carol, s, orders, antonescu, was, placed, under, surveillance, by, the, siguran, a, statului, intelligence, service, and, closely, monitored, by, the, interior, ministry, undersecretary, armand, c, linescu, the, officer, s, political, credentials, were, on, the, rise, as, he, was, able, to, establish, and, maintain, contacts, with, people, on, all, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, while, support, for, carol, plummeted, among, these, were, contacts, with, the, two, main, democratic, groups, the, national, liberal, and, the, national, peasants, parties, known, respectively, as, pnl, and, pn, he, was, also, engaged, in, discussions, with, the, rising, far, right, antisemitic, and, fascist, movements, although, in, competition, with, each, other, both, the, national, christian, party, pnc, of, octavian, goga, and, the, iron, guard, sought, to, attract, antonescu, to, their, side, in, 1936, to, the, authorities, alarm, army, general, and, iron, guard, member, gheorghe, cantacuzino, gr, nicerul, arranged, a, meeting, between, ion, antonescu, and, the, movement, s, leader, corneliu, codreanu, antonescu, is, reported, to, have, found, codreanu, arrogant, but, to, have, welcomed, his, revolutionizing, approach, to, politics, in, late, 1937, after, the, december, general, election, came, to, an, inconclusive, result, carol, appointed, goga, prime, minister, over, a, far, right, cabinet, that, was, the, first, executive, to, impose, racial, discrimination, in, its, treatment, of, the, jewish, community, goga, s, appointment, was, meant, to, curb, the, rise, of, the, more, popular, and, even, more, radical, codreanu, initially, given, the, communications, portfolio, by, his, rival, interior, minister, armand, c, linescu, antonescu, repeatedly, demanded, the, office, of, defense, minister, which, he, was, eventually, granted, his, mandate, coincided, with, a, troubled, period, and, saw, romania, having, to, choose, between, its, traditional, alliance, with, france, britain, the, crumbling, little, entente, and, the, league, of, nations, or, moving, closer, to, nazi, germany, and, its, anti, comintern, pact, antonescu, s, own, contribution, is, disputed, by, historians, who, variously, see, him, as, either, a, supporter, of, the, anglo, french, alliance, or, like, the, pnc, itself, more, favourable, to, cooperation, with, adolf, hitler, s, germany, at, the, time, antonescu, viewed, romania, s, alliance, with, the, entente, as, insurance, against, hungarian, and, soviet, revanchism, but, as, an, anti, communist, he, was, suspicious, of, the, franco, soviet, rapprochement, particularly, concerned, about, hungarian, demands, in, transylvania, he, ordered, the, general, staff, to, prepare, for, a, western, attack, however, his, major, contribution, in, office, was, in, relation, to, an, internal, crisis, as, a, response, to, violent, clashes, between, the, iron, guard, and, the, pnc, s, own, fascist, militia, the, l, ncieri, antonescu, extended, the, already, imposed, martial, law, the, goga, cabinet, ended, when, the, tentative, rapprochement,

front, the, deposed, premier, died, in, 1938, while, antonescu, remained, a, close, friend, of, his, widow, veturia, goga, by, that, time, revising, his, earlier, stance, antonescu, had, also, built, a, close, relationship, with, codreanu, and, was, even, said, to, have, become, his, confidant, on, carol, s, request, he, had, earlier, asked, the, guard, s, leader, to, consider, an, alliance, with, the, king, which, codreanu, promptly, refused, in, favour, of, negotiations, with, goga, coupled, with, claims, that, he, was, not, interested, in, political, battles, an, attitude, supposedly, induced, by, antonescu, himself, soon, afterward, c, linescu, acting, on, indications, from, the, monarch, arrested, codreanu, and, prosecuted, him, in, two, successive, trials, antonescu, whose, mandate, of, defense, minister, had, been, prolonged, under, the, premiership, of, miron, cristea, resigned, in, protest, of, codreanu, s, arrest, antonescu, s, mandate, ended, on, 30, march, 1938, he, also, served, as, air, and, marine, minister, between, 2, february, and, his, resignation, on, 30, march, he, was, a, celebrity, defense, witness, at, the, latter, s, first, and, second, trials, during, the, latter, which, resulted, in, codreanu, s, conviction, for, treason, antonescu, vouched, for, his, friend, s, honesty, while, shaking, his, hand, in, front, of, the, jury, upon, the, conclusion, of, the, trial, the, king, ordered, his, former, minister, interned, at, predeal, before, assigning, him, to, command, the, third, army, in, the, remote, eastern, region, of, bessarabia, and, later, removing, him, after, antonescu, expressed, sympathy, for, guardists, imprisoned, in, chi, in, u, attempting, to, discredit, his, rival, carol, also, ordered, antonescu, s, wife, to, be, tried, for, bigamy, based, on, a, false, claim, that, her, divorce, had, not, been, finalized, defended, by, mihai, antonescu, the, officer, was, able, to, prove, his, detractors, wrong, codreanu, himself, was, taken, into, custody, and, discreetly, killed, by, the, gendarmes, acting, on, carol, s, orders, november, 1938, carol, s, regime, slowly, dissolved, into, crisis, a, dissolution, accelerated, after, the, start, of, world, war, ii, when, the, military, success, of, the, core, axis, powers, and, the, non, aggression, pact, signed, by, germany, and, the, soviet, union, saw, romania, isolated, and, threatened, see, romania, during, world, war, ii, in, 1940, two, of, romania, s, regions, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovina, were, lost, to, a, soviet, occupation, consented, to, by, the, king, this, came, as, romania, exposed, by, the, fall, of, france, was, seeking, to, align, its, policies, with, those, of, germany, ion, antonescu, himself, had, come, to, value, a, pro, axis, alternative, after, the, 1938, munich, agreement, when, germany, imposed, demands, on, czechoslovakia, with, the, acquiescence, of, france, and, the, united, kingdom, leaving, locals, to, fear, that, unless, reoriented, romania, would, follow, angered, by, the, territorial, losses, of, 1940, general, antonescu, sent, carol, a, general, note, of, protest, and, as, a, result, was, arrested, and, interned, at, bistri, a, monastery, while, there, he, commissioned, mihai, antonescu, to, establish, contacts, with, nazi, german, officials, promising, to, advance, german, economic, interest, particularly, in, respect, to, the, local, oil, industry, in, exchange, for, endorsement, commenting, on, ion, antonescu, s, ambivalent, stance, hitler, s, minister, to, romania, wilhelm, fabricius, wrote, to, his, superiors, i, am, not, convinced, that, he, is, a, safe, man, romania, s, elite, had, been, intensely, francophile, ever, since, romania, had, won, its, independence, in, the, 19th, century, indeed, so, francophile, that, the, defeat, of, france, in, june, 1940, had, the, effect, of, discrediting, the, entire, elite, antonescu, s, internment, ended, in, august, during, which, interval, under, axis, pressure, romania, had, ceded, southern, dobruja, to, bulgaria, see, treaty, of, craiova, and, northern, transylvania, to, hungary, see, second, vienna, award, the, latter, grant, caused, consternation, among, large, sections, of, romania, s, population, causing, carol, s, popularity, to, fall, to, a, record, low, and, provoking, large, scale, protests, in, bucharest, the, capital, these, movements, were, organized, competitively, by, the, pro, allied, pn, headed, by, iuliu, maniu, and, the, pro, nazi, iron, guard, the, latter, group, had, been, revived, under, the, leadership, of, horia, sima, and, was, organizing, a, coup, d, tat, in, this, troubled, context, antonescu, simply, left, his, assigned, residence, he, may, have, been, secretly, helped, in, this, by, german, intercession, but, was, more, directly, aided, to, escape, by, socialite, alice, sturdza, who, was, acting, on, maniu, s, request, antonescu, subsequently, met, with, maniu, in, ploie, ti, where, they, discussed, how, best, to, manage, the, political, situation, while, these, negotiations, were, carried, out, the, monarch, himself, was, being, advised, by, his, entourage, to, recover, legitimacy, by, governing, in, tandem, with, the, increasingly, popular, antonescu, while, creating, a, new, political, majority, from, the, existing, forces, on, 2, september, 1940, valer, pop, a, courtier, and, an, important, member, of, the, camarilla, first, advised, carol, to, appoint, antonescu, as, prime, minister, as, the, solution, to, the, crisis, pop, s, reasons, for, advising, carol, to, appoint, antonescu, as, prime, minister, were, partly, because, antonescu, who, was, known, to, be, friendly, with, the, iron, guard, and, who, had, been, imprisoned, under, carol, was, believed, to, have, enough, of, an, oppositional, background, to, carol, s, regime, to, appease, the, public, and, partly, because, pop, knew, that, antonescu, for, all, his, legionary, sympathies, was, a, member, of, the, elite, and, believed, he, would, never, turn, against, it, when, carol, proved, reluctant, to, make, antonescu, prime, minister, pop, visited, the, german, legation, to, meet, with, fabricius, on, the, night, of, 4, september, 1940, to, ask, that, the, german, minister, phone, carol, to, tell, him, that, the, reich, wanted, antonescu, as, prime, minister, and, fabricius, promptly, did, just, that, carol, and, antonescu, accepted, the, proposal, antonescu, being, ordered, to, approach, political, party, leaders, maniu, of, the, pn, and, dinu, br, tianu, of, the, pnl, they, all, called, for, carol, s, abdication, as, a, preliminary, measure, while, sima, another, leader, sought, after, for, negotiations, could, not, be, found, in, time, to, express, his, opinion, antonescu, partly, complied, with, the, request, but, also, asked, carol, to, bestow, upon, him, the, reserve, powers, for, romanian, heads, of, state, carol, yielded, and, on, 5, september, 1940, the, general, became, prime, minister, and, carol, transferred, most, of, his, dictatorial, powers, to, him, the, latter, s, first, measure, was, to, curtail, potential, resistance, within, the, army, by, relieving, bucharest, garrison, chief, gheorghe, arge, anu, of, his, position, and, replacing, him, with, dumitru, coroam, shortly, afterward, antonescu, heard, rumours, that, two, of, carol, s, loyalist, generals, gheorghe, mihail, and, paul, teodorescu, were, planning, to, have, him, killed, in, reaction, he, forced, carol, to, abdicate, while, general, coroam, was, refusing, to, carry, out, the, royal, order, of, shooting, down, iron, guardist, protesters, michael, ascended, the, throne, for, the, second, time, while, antonescu, s, dictatorial, powers, were, confirmed, and, extended, on, 6, september, the, day, michael, formally, assumed, the, throne, he, issued, a, royal, decree, declaring, antonescu, conduc, tor, leader, of, the, state, the, same, decree, relegated, the, monarch, to, a, ceremonial, role, among, antonescu, s, subsequent, measures, was, ensuring, the, safe, departure, into, self, exile, of, carol, and, his, mistress, elena, lupescu, granting, protection, to, the, royal, train, when, it, was, attacked, by, armed, members, of, the, iron, guard, the, regime, of, king, carol, had, been, notorious, for, being, the, most, corrupt, regime, in, europe, during, the, 1930s, and, when, carol, fled, romania, he, took, with, him, the, better, part, of, the, romanian, treasury, leaving, the, new, government, with, enormous, financial, problems, antonescu, had, expected, perhaps, na, vely, that, carol, would, take, with, him, enough, money, to, provide, for, a, comfortable, exile, and, was, surprised, that, carol, had, cleared, out, almost, the, entire, national, treasury, for, the, next, four, years, a, major, concern, of, antonescu, s, government, was, attempting, to, have, the, swiss, banks, where, carol, had, deposited, the, assets, return, the, money, to, romania, this, effort, did, not, meet, with, success, horia, sima, s, subsequent, cooperation, with, antonescu, was, endorsed, by, high, ranking, nazi, german, officials, many, of, whom, feared, the, iron, guard, was, too, weak, to, rule, on, its, own, antonescu, therefore, received, the, approval, of, ambassador, fabricius, despite, early, promises, antonescu, abandoned, projects, for, the, creation, of, a, national, government, and, opted, instead, for, a, coalition, between, a, military, dictatorship, lobby, and, the, iron, guard, he, later, justified, his, choice, by, stating, that, the, iron, guard, represented, the, political, base, of, the, country, at, the, time, right, from, the, outset, antonescu, clashed, with, sima, over, economic, questions, with, antonescu, s, main, concern, being, to, get, the, economy, growing, so, as, to, provide, taxes, for, a, treasury, looted, by, carol, while, sima, favored, populist, economic, measures, that, antonescu, insisted, there, was, no, money, for, the, resulting, regime, deemed, the, national, legionary, state, was, officially, proclaimed, on, 14, september, on, that, date, the, iron, guard, was, remodelled, into, the, only, legally, permitted, party, in, romania, antonescu, continued, as, premier, and, conduc, tor, and, was, named, as, the, guard, s, honorary, commander, sima, became, deputy, premier, and, leader, of, the, guard, antonescu, subsequently, ordered, the, guardists, imprisoned, by, carol, to, be, set, free, on, 6, october, he, presided, over, the, iron, guard, s, mass, rally, in, bucharest, one, in, a, series, of, major, celebratory, and, commemorative, events, organized, by, the, movement, during, the, late, months, of, 1940, however, he, tolerated, the, pn, and, pnl, s, informal, existence, allowing, them, to, preserve, much, of, their, political, support, there, followed, a, short, lived, and, always, uneasy, partnership, between, antonescu, and, sima, in, late, september, the, new, regime, denounced, all, pacts, accords, and, diplomatic, agreements, signed, under, carol, bringing, the, country, into, germany, s, orbit, while, subverting, its, relationship, with, a, former, balkan, ally, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, germans, troops, entered, the, country, in, stages, in, order, to, defend, the, local, oil, industry, and, help, instruct, their, romanian, counterparts, on, blitzkrieg, tactics, on, 23, november, antonescu, was, in, berlin, where, his, signature, sealed, romania, s, commitment, to, the, main, axis, instrument, the, tripartite, pact, two, days, later, the, country, also, adhered, to, the, nazi, led, anti, comintern, pact, other, than, these, generic, commitments, romania, had, no, treaty, binding, it, to, germany, and, the, romanian, german, alliance, functioned, informally, speaking, in, 1946, antonescu, claimed, to, have, followed, the, pro, german, path, in, continuation, of, earlier, policies, and, for, fear, of, a, nazi, protectorate, in, romania, during, the, national, legionary, state, period, earlier, antisemitic, legislation, was, upheld, and, strengthened, while, the, romanianization, of, jewish, owned, enterprises, became, standard, official, practice, immediately, after, coming, into, office, antonescu, himself, expanded, the, anti, jewish, and, nuremberg, law, inspired, legislation, passed, by, his, predecessors, goga, and, ion, gigurtu, while, tens, of, new, anti, jewish, regulations, were, passed, in, 1941, 1942, this, was, done, despite, his, formal, pledge, to, wilhelm, filderman, and, the, jewish, communities, federation, that, unless, engaged, in, sabotage, the, jewish, population, will, not, suffer, antonescu, did, not, reject, the, application, of, legionary, policies, but, was, offended, by, sima, s, advocacy, of, paramilitarism, and, the, guard, s, frequent, recourse, to, street, violence, he, drew, much, hostility, from, his, partners, by, extending, some, protection, to, former, dignitaries, whom, the, iron, guard, had, arrested, one, early, incident, opposed, antonescu, to, the, guard, s, newspaper, buna, vestire, which, accused, him, of, leniency, and, was, subsequently, forced, to, change, its, editorial, board, by, then, the, legionary, press, was, routinely, claiming, that, he, was, obstructing, revolution, and, aiming, to, take, control, of, the, iron, guard, and, that, he, had, been, transformed, into, a, tool, of, freemasonry, see, anti, masonry, the, political, conflict, coincided, with, major, social, challenges, including, the, influx, of, refugees, from, areas, lost, earlier, in, the, year, and, a, large, scale, earthquake, affecting, bucharest, disorder, peaked, in, the, last, days, of, november, 1940, when, after, uncovering, the, circumstances, of, codreanu, s, death, the, fascist, movement, ordered, retaliations, against, political, figures, previously, associated, with, carol, carrying, out, the, jilava, massacre, the, assassinations, of, nicolae, iorga, and, virgil, madgearu, and, several, other, acts, of, violence, as, retaliation, for, this, insubordination, antonescu, ordered, the, army, to, resume, control, of, the, streets, unsuccessfully, pressured, sima, to, have, the, assassins, detained, ousted, the, iron, guardist, prefect, of, bucharest, police, tefan, z, voianu, and, ordered, legionary, ministers, to, swear, an, oath, to, the, conduc, tor, his, condemnation, of, the, killings, was, nevertheless, limited, and, discreet, and, the, same, month, he, joined, sima, at, a, burial, ceremony, for, codreanu, s, newly, discovered, remains, the, widening, gap, between, the, dictator, and, sima, s, party, resonated, in, berlin, when, in, december, legionary, foreign, minister, mihail, r, sturdza, obtained, the, replacement, of, fabricius, with, manfred, freiherr, von, killinger, perceived, as, more, sympathetic, to, the, iron, guard, antonescu, promptly, took, over, leadership, of, the, ministry, with, the, compliant, diplomat, constantin, greceanu, as, his, right, hand, in, germany, such, leaders, of, the, nazi, party, as, heinrich, himmler, baldur, von, schirach, and, joseph, goebbels, threw, their, support, behind, the, legionaries, whereas, foreign, minister, joachim, von, ribbentrop, and, the, wehrmacht, stood, by, antonescu, the, latter, group, was, concerned, that, any, internal, conflict, would, threaten, romania, s, oil, industry, vital, to, the, german, war, effort, the, german, leadership, was, by, then, secretly, organizing, operation, barbarossa, the, attack, on, the, soviet, union, antonescu, s, plan, to, act, against, his, coalition, partners, in, the, event, of, further, disorder, hinged, on, hitler, s, approval, a, vague, signal, of, which, had, been, given, during, ceremonies, confirming, romania, s, adherence, to, the, tripartite, pact, a, decisive, turn, occurred, when, hitler, invited, antonescu, and, sima, both, over, for, discussions, whereas, antonescu, agreed, sima, stayed, behind, in, romania, probably, plotting, a, coup, d, tat, while, hitler, did, not, produce, a, clear, endorsement, for, clamping, down, on, sima, s, party, he, made, remarks, interpreted, by, their, recipient, as, oblique, blessings, on, 14, january, 1941, during, a, german, romanian, summit, hitler, informed, antonescu, of, his, plans, to, invade, the, soviet, union, later, that, year, and, asked, romania, to, participate, by, this, time, hitler, had, come, to, the, conclusion, that, while, sima, was, ideologically, closer, to, him, antonescu, was, the, more, competent, leader, capable, of, ensuring, stability, in, romania, while, being, committed, to, aligning, his, country, with, the, axis, the, antonescu, sima, dispute, erupted, into, violence, in, january, 1941, when, the, iron, guard, instigated, a, series, of, attacks, on, public, institutions, and, a, pogrom, incidents, collectively, known, as, the, legionary, rebellion, this, came, after, the, mysterious, assassination, of, major, d, ring, a, german, agent, in, bucharest, which, was, used, by, the, iron, guard, as, a, pretext, to, accuse, the, conduc, tor, of, having, a, secret, anti, german, agenda, and, made, antonescu, oust, the, legionary, interior, minister, constantin, petrovicescu, while, closing, down, all, of, the, legionary, controlled, romanianization, offices, various, other, clashes, prompted, him, to, demand, the, resignation, of, all, police, commanders, who, sympathized, with, the, movement, after, two, days, of, widespread, violence, during, which, guardists, killed, some, 120, bucharest, jews, antonescu, sent, in, the, army, under, the, command, of, general, constantin, s, n, tescu, german, officials, acting, on, hitler, s, orders, including, the, new, ambassador, manfred, freiherr, von, killinger, helped, antonescu, eliminate, the, iron, guardists, but, several, of, their, lower, level, colleagues, actively, aided, sima, s, subordinates, goebbels, was, especially, upset, by, the, decision, to, support, antonescu, believing, it, to, have, been, advantageous, to, the, freemasons, after, the, purge, of, the, iron, guard, hitler, kept, his, options, open, by, granting, political, asylum, to, sima, whom, antonescu, s, courts, sentenced, to, death, and, to, other, legionaries, in, similar, situations, the, guardists, were, detained, in, special, conditions, at, buchenwald, and, dachau, concentration, camps, in, parallel, antonescu, publicly, obtained, the, cooperation, of, codreanists, members, of, an, iron, guardist, wing, which, had, virulently, opposed, sima, and, whose, leader, was, codreanu, s, father, ion, zelea, codreanu, antonescu, again, sought, backing, from, the, pn, and, pnl, to, form, a, national, cabinet, but, his, rejection, of, parliamentarism, made, the, two, groups, refuse, him, antonescu, traveled, to, germany, and, met, hitler, on, eight, more, occasions, between, june, 1941, and, august, 1944, such, close, contacts, helped, cement, an, enduring, relationship, between, the, two, dictators, and, hitler, reportedly, came, to, see, antonescu, as, the, only, trustworthy, person, in, romania, and, the, only, foreigner, to, consult, on, military, matters, the, american, historian, gerhard, weinberg, wrote, that, hitler, after, first, meeting, antonescu, was, greatly, impressed, by, him, no, other, leader, hitler, met, other, than, mussolini, ever, received, such, consistently, favourable, comments, from, the, german, dictator, hitler, even, mustered, the, patience, to, listen, to, antonescu, s, lengthy, disquisitions, on, the, glorious, history, of, romania, and, the, perfidy, of, the, hungarians, a, curious, reversal, for, a, man, who, was, more, accustomed, to, regaling, visitors, with, tirades, of, his, own, in, later, statements, hitler, offered, praise, to, antonescu, s, breadth, of, vision, and, real, personality, a, remarkable, aspect, of, the, hitler, antonescu, friendship, was, neither, could, speak, other, s, language, hitler, only, knew, german, while, the, only, foreign, language, antonescu, knew, was, french, in, which, he, was, completely, fluent, during, their, meetings, antonescu, spoke, french, which, was, then, translated, into, german, by, hitler, s, interpreter, paul, schmidt, and, vice, versa, since, schmidt, did, not, speak, romanian, either, the, german, military, presence, increased, significantly, in, early, 1941, when, using, romania, as, a, base, hitler, invaded, the, rebellious, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, and, the, kingdom, of, greece, see, balkans, campaign, in, parallel, romania, s, relationship, with, the, united, kingdom, at, the, time, the, only, major, adversary, of, nazi, germany, erupted, into, conflict, on, 10, february, 1941, british, premier, winston, churchill, recalled, his, majesty, s, ambassador, reginald, hoare, and, approved, the, blockade, of, romanian, ships, in, british, controlled, ports, on, 12, june, 1941, during, another, summit, with, hitler, antonescu, first, learned, of, the, special, nature, of, operation, barbarossa, namely, that, the, war, against, the, soviet, union, was, to, be, an, ideological, war, to, annihilate, the, forces, of, judeo, bolshevism, a, war, of, extermination, to, be, fought, without, any, mercy, hitler, even, showed, antonescu, a, copy, of, the, guidelines, for, the, conduct, of, the, troops, in, russia, he, had, issued, to, his, forces, about, the, special, treatment, to, be, handed, out, to, soviet, jews, antonescu, completely, accepted, hitler, s, ideas, about, operation, barbarossa, as, a, race, war, between, the, aryans, represented, by, the, nordic, germans, and, latin, romanians, on, the, axis, side, vs, the, slavs, and, asians, commanded, by, the, jews, on, the, soviet, side, besides, anti, semitism, there, was, an, extremely, strong, current, of, anti, slavic, and, anti, asian, racism, to, antonescu, s, remarks, about, the, asiatic, hordes, of, the, red, army, the, asians, antonescu, referred, were, the, various, asian, peoples, of, the, soviet, union, such, as, the, kazakhs, kalmyks, mongols, uzbeks, buryats, etc, during, his, summit, with, hitler, in, june, 1941, antonescu, told, the, f, hrer, that, he, believed, it, was, necessary, to, once, and, for, all, eliminate, russia, as, a, power, because, the, russians, were, the, most, powerful, slavic, nation, and, that, as, a, latin, people, the, romanians, had, an, inborn, hatred, of, all, slavs, and, jews, antonescu, went, on, to, tell, hitler, because, of, its, racial, qualities, romania, can, continue, to, play, its, role, as, an, anti, slavic, buffer, for, the, benefit, of, germany, ancel, wrote, that, romanian, anti, slavic, racism, differed, from, the, german, variety, in, that, the, romanians, had, traditionally, feared, the, slavic, peoples, whereas, the, germans, had, traditionally, held, the, slavic, peoples, in, contempt, in, antonescu, s, mind, the, romanians, as, a, latin, people, had, attained, a, level, of, civilization, that, the, slavs, were, nowhere, close, to, but, theoretically, the, slavic, russians, and, ukrainians, might, be, able, to, reach, under, romanian, auspices, although, antonescu, s, remarks, to, hitler, that, we, must, fight, this, race, i, e, the, slavs, resolutely, together, with, the, need, for, colonization, of, transnistria, suggests, that, he, did, think, this, would, happen, in, his, own, lifetime, subsequently, the, romanians, assigned, to, barbarossa, were, to, learn, that, as, a, latin, people, the, germans, considered, them, to, be, their, inferiors, albeit, not, as, inferior, as, the, slavs, asians, and, jews, who, were, viewed, as, untermenschen, sub, humans, hitler, s, promise, to, antonescu, that, after, the, war, the, germanic, and, latin, races, would, rule, the, world, in, a, partnership, turned, out, to, be, meaningless, in, june, of, that, year, romania, joined, the, attack, on, the, soviet, union, led, by, germany, in, coalition, with, hungary, finland, the, state, of, slovakia, the, kingdom, of, italy, and, the, independent, state, of, croatia, antonescu, had, been, made, aware, of, the, plan, by, german, envoys, and, supported, it, enthusiastically, even, before, hitler, extended, romania, an, offer, to, participate, on, 18, june, 1941, antonescu, gave, orders, to, his, generals, about, cleansing, the, ground, of, jews, when, romanian, forces, entered, bessarabia, and, bukovina, right, from, the, start, antonescu, proclaimed, the, war, against, the, soviet, union, to, be, a, holy, war, a, crusade, in, the, name, of, eastern, orthodox, faith, and, the, romanian, race, against, the, forces, of, judeo, bolshevism, the, propaganda, of, the, antonescu, regime, demonized, everything, jewish, as, antonescu, believed, that, communism, was, invented, by, the, jews, and, all, of, the, soviet, leaders, were, really, jews, reflecting, antonescu, s, anti, slavic, feelings, despite, the, fact, that, the, war, was, billed, as, a, crusade, in, defence, of, orthodoxy, against, judeo, bolshevism, the, war, was, not, presented, as, a, struggle, to, liberate, the, orthodox, russians, and, ukrainians, from, communism, instead, rule, by, judeo, bolshevism, was, portrayed, as, something, brought, about, the, innate, moral, inferiority, of, the, slavs, who, thus, needed, to, be, ruled, by, the, germans, and, the, romanians, the, romanian, force, engaged, formed, a, general, antonescu, army, group, under, the, effective, command, of, german, general, eugen, ritter, von, schobert, romania, s, campaign, on, the, eastern, front, began, without, a, formal, declaration, of, war, and, was, consecrated, by, antonescu, s, statement, soldiers, i, order, you, cross, the, prut, river, in, reference, to, the, bessarabian, border, between, romania, and, post, 1940, soviet, territory, a, few, days, after, this, a, large, scale, pogrom, was, carried, out, in, ia, i, with, antonescu, s, agreement, thousands, of, jews, were, killed, in, the, bloody, ia, i, pogrom, antonescu, had, followed, a, generation, of, younger, right, wing, romanian, intellectuals, led, by, corneliu, zelea, codreanu, who, in, the, 1920s, 30s, had, rejected, the, traditional, francophila, of, the, romanian, elites, and, their, adherence, to, western, notions, of, universal, democratic, values, and, human, rights, antonescu, made, it, clear, that, his, regime, rejected, the, moral, principles, of, the, demo, liberal, world, and, he, saw, the, war, as, an, ideological, struggle, between, his, spiritually, pure, national, totalitarian, regime, vs, jewish, morality, antonescu, believed, that, the, liberal, humanist, democratic, capitalist, values, of, the, west, and, communism, were, both, invented, by, the, jews, to, destroy, romania, in, a, lengthy, speech, just, before, the, war, antonescu, attacked, democracy, in, the, most, violent, terms, as, it, allowed, jews, equal, rights, and, thus, to, undercut, the, romanian, national, idea, as, such, antonescu, stated, what, was, needed, was, a, new, man, who, would, be, tough, virile, and, willing, to, fight, for, an, ethnically, and, religiously, pure, romania, despite, his, quarrel, with, sima, much, of, antonescu, s, speech, clearly, reflected, the, influence, of, the, ideas, of, the, iron, guard, that, antonescu, had, absorbed, in, the, 1930s, antonescu, s, anti, semitism, and, sexism, went, so, far, that, he, tacitly, condoned, the, rape, of, jewish, women, and, girls, in, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovinia, by, his, forces, under, the, grounds, that, he, was, going, take, away, all, of, the, property, that, the, jews, had, stolen, from, the, romanians, and, as, far, he, was, concerned, jewish, females, were, just, another, piece, of, property, since, the, jewish, women, were, going, to, exterminated, anyway, antonescu, felt, there, was, nothing, wrong, about, letting, his, soldiers, and, gendarmes, have, some, fun, before, shooting, them, after, becoming, the, first, romanian, to, be, granted, the, knight, s, cross, of, the, iron, cross, which, he, received, from, hitler, at, their, 6, august, meeting, in, the, ukrainian, city, of, berdychiv, ion, antonescu, was, promoted, to, marshal, of, romania, by, royal, decree, on, 22, august, in, recognition, for, his, role, in, restoring, the, eastern, frontiers, of, greater, romania, in, a, report, to, berlin, a, german, diplomat, wrote, that, marshal, antonescu, had, syphilis, and, that, among, cavalry, officers, this, disease, is, as, widespread, as, a, common, cold, is, among, german, officers, the, marshal, suffers, from, severe, attacks, of, it, every, several, months, antonescu, took, one, of, his, most, debated, decisions, when, with, bessarabia, s, conquest, almost, complete, he, committed, romania, to, hitler, s, war, effort, beyond, the, dniester, that, is, beyond, territory, that, had, been, part, of, romania, between, the, wars, and, thrust, deeper, into, soviet, territory, thus, waging, a, war, of, aggression, on, 30, august, romania, occupied, a, territory, it, deemed, transnistria, formerly, a, part, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, including, the, entire, moldavian, assr, and, further, territories, like, the, decision, to, continue, the, war, beyond, bessarabia, this, earned, antonescu, much, criticism, from, the, semi, clandestine, pnl, and, pn, insofar, as, the, war, against, the, soviet, union, was, a, war, to, recover, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovina, both, regions, that, been, a, part, of, romania, until, june, 1940, and, that, had, romanian, majorities, the, conflict, had, been, very, popular, with, the, romanian, public, opinion, but, the, idea, of, conquering, transnistria, was, not, as, that, region, had, never, been, part, of, romania, and, a, minority, of, the, people, were, ethnic, romanian, soon, after, the, takeover, the, area, was, assigned, to, a, civil, administration, apparatus, headed, by, gheorghe, alexianu, and, became, the, site, for, the, main, component, of, the, holocaust, in, romania, a, mass, deportation, of, the, bessarabian, and, ukrainian, jews, followed, later, by, transports, of, romani, romanians, and, jews, from, moldavia, proper, that, is, the, portions, of, moldavia, west, of, the, prut, the, accord, over, transnistria, s, administration, signed, in, tighina, also, placed, areas, between, the, dniester, and, the, dnieper, under, romanian, military, occupation, while, granting, control, over, all, resources, to, germany, in, september, 1941, antonescu, ordered, romanian, forces, to, take, odessa, a, prize, he, badly, wanted, for, reasons, of, prestige, russians, had, traditionally, been, seen, in, romania, as, brutal, aggressors, and, for, romanian, forces, to, take, a, major, soviet, city, and, one, of, the, largest, black, sea, ports, like, odessa, would, be, a, sign, of, how, far, romania, had, been, regenerated, under, antonescu, s, leadership, much, to, antonescu, s, intense, fury, the, red, army, were, able, to, halt, the, romanian, offensive, on, odessa, and, 24, september, 1941, antonescu, had, to, reluctantly, ask, for, the, help, of, the, wehrmacht, with, the, drive, on, odessa, on, 16, october, 1941, odessa, fell, to, the, german, romanian, forces, the, romanian, losses, had, been, so, heavy, that, the, area, around, odessa, was, known, to, the, romanian, army, as, the, vale, of, tears, antonescu, s, anti, semitism, was, sharpened, by, the, odessa, fighting, as, he, was, convinced, that, the, only, reason, why, the, red, army, had, fought, so, fiercely, around, odessa, was, that, the, average, russian, soldier, had, been, terrorized, by, bloodthirsty, jewish, commissars, into, fighting, hard, when, wilhelm, filderman, wrote, a, letter, to, antonescu, complaining, about, the, murder, of, jews, in, odessa, antonescu, wrote, back, your, jews, who, have, become, soviet, commissars, are, driving, soviet, soldiers, in, the, odessa, region, into, a, futile, bloodbath, through, horrendous, terror, techniques, as, the, russian, prisoners, themselves, have, admitted, simply, to, cause, us, heavy, losses, antonescu, ended, his, letter, with, the, claim, that, russian, jewish, commissars, had, savagely, tortured, romanian, pows, and, that, the, entire, jewish, community, of, romania, filderman, included, were, morally, responsible, for, all, of, the, losses, and, sufferings, of, the, romanians, around, odessa, in, the, fall, of, 1941, antonescu, planned, to, deport, all, of, the, jews, of, the, regat, southern, bukovina, and, southern, transylvania, into, transnistria, as, the, prelude, to, killing, them, but, this, operation, was, vetoed, by, germany, who, complained, that, antonescu, had, not, finished, killing, the, jews, of, transnistria, yet, this, veto, was, largely, motivated, by, bureaucratic, politics, namely, if, antonescu, exterminated, all, of, the, jews, of, romania, himself, there, would, be, nothing, for, the, ss, and, the, ausw, rtiges, amt, to, do, killinger, informed, antonescu, that, germany, would, reduce, its, supplies, of, arms, if, antonescu, went, ahead, with, his, plans, to, deport, the, jews, of, the, regat, into, transnistria, and, told, him, he, would, be, better, off, deporting, the, jews, to, the, death, camps, in, poland, that, the, germans, were, already, busy, building, since, romania, had, almost, no, arms, industry, of, its, own, and, was, almost, entirely, dependent, upon, weapons, from, germany, to, fight, the, war, antonescu, had, little, choice, but, to, comply, with, killinger, s, request, the, romanian, army, s, inferior, arms, insufficient, armour, and, lack, of, training, had, been, major, concerns, for, the, german, commanders, since, before, the, start, of, the, operation, one, of, the, earliest, major, obstacles, antonescu, encountered, on, the, eastern, front, was, the, resistance, of, odessa, a, soviet, port, on, the, black, sea, refusing, any, german, assistance, he, ordered, the, romanian, army, to, maintain, a, two, month, siege, on, heavily, fortified, and, well, defended, positions, the, ill, equipped, 4th, army, suffered, losses, of, some, 100, 000, men, antonescu, s, popularity, again, rose, in, october, when, the, fall, of, odessa, was, celebrated, triumphantly, with, a, parade,

of, the, jewish, population, ordered, by, the, marshal, as, retaliation, for, a, bombing, which, killed, a, number, of, romanian, officers, and, soldiers, general, ioan, glogojeanu, among, them, the, city, subsequently, became, the, administrative, capital, of, transnistria, according, to, one, account, the, romanian, administration, planned, to, change, odessa, s, name, to, antonescu, antonescu,

especially, keen, on, the, former, antonescu, planned, on, attacking, hungary, to, recover, transylvania, at, the, first, opportunity, and, regarded, romanian, involvement, on, the, eastern, front, in, part, as, a, way, of, proving, to, hitler, that, romania, was, a, better, german, ally, than, hungary, and, thus, deserving, of, german, support, when, the, planned, romanian, hungarian, war, began, the, conduc, tor, had, also, created, an, intra, axis, alliance, against, hungary, along, with, croatia, and, slovakia, as, the, soviet, union, recovered, from, the, initial, shock, and, slowed, down, the, axis, offensive, at, the, battle, of, moscow, october, 1941, january, 1942, romania, was, asked, by, its, allies, to, contribute, a, larger, number, of, troops, a, decisive, factor, in, antonescu, s, compliance, with, the, request, appears, to, have, been, a, special, visit, to, bucharest, by, wehrmacht, chief, of, staff, wilhelm, keitel, who, introduced, the, conduc, tor, to, hitler, s, plan, for, attacking, the, caucasus, see, battle, of, the, caucasus, the, romanian, force, engaged, in, the, war, reportedly, exceeded, german, demands, it, came, to, around, 500, 000, troops, and, thirty, actively, involved, divisions, as, a, sign, of, his, satisfaction, hitler, presented, his, romanian, counterpart, with, a, luxury, car, on, 7, december, 1941, after, reflecting, on, the, possibility, for, romania, hungary, and, finland, to, change, their, stance, the, british, government, responded, to, repeated, soviet, requests, and, declared, war, on, all, three, countries, following, japan, s, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, in, compliance, with, its, axis, commitment, romania, declared, war, on, the, united, states, within, five, days, these, developments, contrasted, with, antonescu, s, own, statement, of, 7, december, i, am, an, ally, of, the, reich, against, i, am, neutral, in, the, conflict, between, great, britain, and, germany, i, am, for, america, against, the, japanese, a, crucial, change, in, the, war, came, with, the, battle, of, stalingrad, in, june, 1942, february, 1943, a, major, defeat, for, the, axis, romania, s, armies, alone, lost, some, 150, 000, men, either, dead, wounded, or, captured, and, more, than, half, of, the, country, s, divisions, were, wiped, out, the, loss, of, two, entire, romanian, armies, who, all, either, killed, or, captured, by, the, soviets, produced, a, major, crisis, in, german, romanian, relations, in, the, winter, of, 1943, with, many, people, in, the, romanian, government, for, the, first, time, questioning, the, wisdom, of, fighting, on, the, side, of, the, axis, outside, of, the, elites, by, 1943, the, continuing, heavy, losses, on, the, eastern, front, anger, at, the, contempt, which, the, wehrmacht, treated, their, romanian, allies, and, declining, living, standards, within, romania, made, the, war, unpopular, with, the, romanian, people, and, consequently, the, conduc, tor, himself, the, american, historian, gerhard, weinberg, wrote, that, the, string, of, broken, german, promises, of, equipment, and, support, the, disregard, of, warnings, about, soviet, offensive, preparations, the, unfriendly, treatment, of, retreating, romanian, units, by, german, officers, and, soldiers, and, the, general, german, tendency, to, blame, their, own, miscalculations, and, disasters, on, their, allies, all, combined, to, produce, a, real, crisis, in, german, romanian, relations, for, part, of, that, interval, the, marshal, had, withdrawn, from, public, life, owing, to, an, unknown, affliction, which, is, variously, rumoured, to, have, been, a, mental, breakdown, a, foodborne, illness, or, a, symptom, of, the, syphilis, he, had, contracted, earlier, in, life, he, is, known, to, have, been, suffering, from, digestive, problems, treating, himself, with, food, prepared, by, marlene, von, exner, an, austrian, born, dietitian, who, moved, into, hitler, s, service, after, 1943, upon, his, return, antonescu, blamed, the, romanian, losses, on, german, overseer, arthur, hauffe, whom, hitler, agreed, to, replace, in, parallel, with, the, military, losses, romania, was, confronted, with, large, scale, economic, problems, romania, s, oil, was, the, reich, s, only, source, of, natural, oil, after, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, in, june, 1941, to, august, 1944, germany, also, had, synthetic, oil, plants, operating, from, 1942, onwards, and, as, such, for, economic, reasons, romania, was, always, treated, as, a, major, ally, by, hitler, while, germany, monopolized, romania, s, exports, it, defaulted, on, most, of, its, payments, like, all, countries, whose, exports, to, germany, particularly, in, oil, exceeded, imports, from, that, country, romania, s, economy, suffered, from, nazi, control, of, the, exchange, rate, see, economy, of, nazi, germany, on, the, german, side, those, directly, involved, in, harnessing, romania, s, economic, output, for, german, goals, were, economic, planners, hermann, g, ring, and, walther, funk, together, with, hermann, neubacher, the, special, representative, for, economic, problems, a, recurring, problem, for, antonescu, was, attempting, to, obtain, payments, for, all, of, the, oil, he, shipped, to, germany, while, resisting, german, demands, for, increased, oil, production, the, situation, was, further, aggravated, in, 1942, as, usaaf, and, raf, were, able, to, bomb, the, oil, fields, in, prahova, county, see, bombing, of, romania, in, world, war, ii, operation, tidal, wave, official, sources, from, the, following, period, amalgamate, military, and, civilian, losses, of, all, kinds, which, produces, a, total, of, 554, 000, victims, of, the, war, to, improve, the, romanian, army, s, effectiveness, the, mare, al, tank, destroyer, was, developed, starting, in, late, 1942, marshal, antonescu, after, whom, the, vehicle, was, named, was, involved, in, the, project, himself, the, vehicle, later, influenced, the, development, of, the, german, hetzer, in, this, context, the, romanian, leader, acknowledged, that, germany, was, losing, the, war, and, he, therefore, authorized, his, deputy, premier, and, new, foreign, minister, mihai, antonescu, to, set, up, contacts, with, the, allies, in, early, 1943, antonescu, authorized, his, diplomats, to, contact, british, and, american, diplomats, in, portugal, and, switzerland, to, see, if, were, possible, for, romania, to, sign, an, armistice, with, the, western, powers, the, romanian, diplomats, were, informed, that, no, armistice, was, possible, until, an, armistice, was, signed, with, the, soviet, union, a, condition, antonescu, rejected, in, parallel, he, allowed, the, pn, and, the, pnl, to, engage, in, parallel, talks, with, the, allies, at, various, locations, in, neutral, countries, the, discussions, were, strained, by, the, western, allies, call, for, an, unconditional, surrender, over, which, the, romanian, envoys, bargained, with, allied, diplomats, in, sweden, and, egypt, among, them, the, soviet, representatives, nikolai, novikov, and, alexandra, kollontai, antonescu, was, also, alarmed, by, the, possibility, of, war, being, carried, on, romanian, territory, as, had, happened, in, italy, after, operation, avalanche, the, events, also, prompted, hostile, negotiations, aimed, at, toppling, antonescu, and, involving, the, two, political, parties, the, young, monarch, diplomats, and, soldiers, a, major, clash, between, michael, and, antonescu, took, place, during, the, first, days, of, 1943, when, the, 21, year, old, monarch, used, his, new, year, s, address, on, national, radio, to, part, with, the, axis, war, effort, in, march, 1944, the, soviet, red, army, broke, the, southern, bug, and, dniester, fronts, advancing, on, bessarabia, this, came, just, as, field, marshal, henry, maitland, wilson, the, british, supreme, allied, commander, of, the, mediterranean, theatre, presented, antonescu, with, an, ultimatum, after, a, new, visit, to, germany, and, a, meeting, with, hitler, antonescu, opted, to, continue, fighting, alongside, the, remaining, axis, states, a, decision, which, he, later, claimed, was, motivated, by, hitler, s, promise, to, allow, romania, possession, of, northern, transylvania, in, the, event, of, an, axis, victory, upon, his, return, the, conduc, tor, oversaw, a, counteroffensive, which, stabilized, the, front, on, a, line, between, ia, i, and, chi, in, u, to, the, north, and, the, lower, dniester, to, the, east, this, normalized, his, relations, with, nazi, german, officials, whose, alarm, over, the, possible, loss, of, an, ally, had, resulted, in, the, margarethe, ii, plan, an, adapted, version, of, the, nazi, takeover, in, hungary, however, antonescu, s, non, compliance, with, the, terms, of, wilson, s, ultimatum, also, had, drastic, effects, on, romania, s, ability, to, exit, the, war, by, then, antonescu, was, conceiving, of, a, separate, peace, with, the, western, allies, while, maintaining, contacts, with, the, soviets, in, parallel, the, mainstream, opposition, movement, came, to, establish, contacts, with, the, romanian, communist, party, pcr, which, although, minor, numerically, gained, importance, for, being, the, only, political, group, to, be, favored, by, soviet, leader, joseph, stalin, on, the, pcr, side, the, discussions, involved, lucre, iu, p, tr, canu, and, later, emil, bodn, ra, another, participating, group, at, this, stage, was, the, old, romanian, social, democratic, party, large, scale, allied, bombings, of, bucharest, took, place, in, spring, 1944, while, the, soviet, red, army, approached, romanian, borders, the, battle, for, romania, began, in, late, summer, while, german, commanders, johannes, frie, ner, and, otto, w, hler, of, the, army, group, south, ukraine, attempted, to, hold, bukovina, soviet, steppe, front, leader, rodion, malinovsky, stormed, into, the, areas, of, moldavia, defended, by, petre, dumitrescu, s, troops, in, reaction, antonescu, attempted, to, stabilize, the, front, on, a, line, between, foc, ani, n, moloasa, and, br, ila, deep, inside, romanian, territory, on, 5, august, he, visited, hitler, one, final, time, in, k, trzyn, on, this, occasion, the, german, leader, reportedly, explained, that, his, people, had, betrayed, the, nazi, cause, and, asked, him, if, romania, would, go, on, fighting, to, which, antonescu, reportedly, answered, in, vague, terms, after, soviet, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, more, than, once, stated, that, the, soviet, union, was, not, going, to, require, romanian, subservience, the, factions, opposing, antonescu, agreed, that, the, moment, had, come, to, overthrow, him, by, carrying, out, the, royal, coup, of, 23, august, on, that, day, the, sovereign, asked, antonescu, to, meet, him, in, the, royal, palace, where, he, presented, him, with, a, request, to, take, romania, out, of, its, axis, alliance, the, conduc, tor, refused, and, was, promptly, arrested, by, soldiers, of, the, guard, being, replaced, as, premier, with, general, constantin, s, n, tescu, who, presided, over, a, national, government, the, new, romanian, authorities, declared, peace, with, the, allies, and, advised, the, population, to, greet, soviet, troops, on, 25, august, as, bucharest, was, successfully,

offensive, against, yugoslav, partisans, the, coup, was, nevertheless, a, unilateral, move, and, until, the, signature, of, an, armistice, on, 12, september, the, country, was, still, perceived, as, an, enemy, by, the, soviets, who, continued, to, take, romanian, soldiers, as, prisoners, of, war, in, parallel, hitler, reactivated, the, iron, guardist, exile, creating, a, sima, led, government, in, exile, that, did, not, survive, the, war, s, end, in, europe, placed, in, the, custody, of, pcr, militants, ion, antonescu, spent, the, interval, at, a, house, in, bucharest, s, vatra, luminoas, quarter, he, was, afterward, handed, to, the, soviet, occupation, forces, who, transported, him, to, moscow, together, with, his, deputy, mihai, antonescu, governor, of, transnistria, gheorghe, alexianu, defense, minister, constantin, pantazi, gendarmerie, commander, constantin, vasiliu, and, bucharest, police, chief, mircea, elefterescu, they, were, subsequently, kept, in, luxurious, detention, at, a, mansion, nearby, the, city, and, guarded, by, smersh, a, special, counter, intelligence, body, answering, directly, to, stalin, shortly, after, germany, surrendered, in, may, 1945, the, group, was, moved, to, lubyanka, prison, there, antonescu, was, interrogated, and, reputedly, pressured, by, smersh, operatives, among, them, viktor, abakumov, but, transcripts, of, their, conversations, were, never, sent, back, to, romania, by, the, soviet, authorities, later, research, noted, that, the, main, issues, discussed, were, the, german, romanian, alliance, the, war, on, the, soviet, union, the, economic, toll, on, both, countries, and, romania, s, participation, in, the, holocaust, defined, specifically, as, crimes, against, peaceful, soviet, citizens, at, some, point, during, this, period, antonescu, attempted, suicide, in, his, quarters, he, was, returned, to, bucharest, in, spring, 1946, and, held, in, jilava, prison, he, was, subsequently, interrogated, by, prosecutor, avram, bunaciu, to, whom, he, complained, about, the, conditions, of, his, detainment, contrasting, them, with, those, in, moscow, while, explaining, that, he, was, a, vegetarian, and, demanding, a, special, diet, in, may, 1946, ion, antonescu, was, prosecuted, at, the, first, in, a, series, of, people, s, tribunals, on, charges, of, war, crimes, crimes, against, the, peace, and, treason, the, tribunals, had, first, been, proposed, by, the, pn, and, were, comparable, to, the, nuremberg, trials, in, allied, occupied, germany, the, romanian, legislative, framework, was, drafted, by, coup, participant, p, tr, canu, a, pcr, member, who, had, been, granted, leadership, of, the, justice, ministry, despite, the, idea, having, earned, support, from, several, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, the, procedures, were, politicized, in, a, sense, favourable, to, the, pcr, and, the, soviet, union, and, posed, a, legal, problem, for, being, based, on, ex, post, facto, decisions, the, first, such, local, trial, took, place, in, 1945, resulting, in, the, sentencing, of, iosif, iacobici, nicolae, macici, constantin, trestioreanu, and, other, military, commanders, directly, involved, in, planning, or, carrying, out, the, odessa, massacre, antonescu, was, represented, by, constantin, paraschivescu, b, l, ceanu, and, titus, stoica, two, public, defenders, whom, he, had, first, consulted, with, a, day, before, the, procedures, were, initiated, the, prosecution, team, led, by, vasile, stoican, and, the, panel, of, judges, presided, over, by, alexandru, voitinovici, were, infiltrated, by, pcr, supporters, both, consistently, failed, to, admit, that, antonescu, s, foreign, policies, were, overall, dictated, by, romania, s, positioning, between, germany, and, the, soviet, union, nevertheless, and, although, references, to, the, mass, murders, formed, just, 23, of, the, indictment, and, corpus, of, evidence, ranking, below, charges, of, anti, soviet, aggression, the, procedures, also, included, antonescu, s, admission, of, and, self, exculpating, take, on, war, crimes, including, the, deportations, to, transnistria, they, also, evidence, his, awareness, of, the, odessa, massacre, accompanied, by, his, claim, that, few, of, the, deaths, were, his, direct, responsibility, one, notable, event, at, the, trial, was, a, testimony, by, pn, leader, iuliu, maniu, reacting, against, the, aggressive, tone, of, other, accusers, maniu, went, on, record, saying, we, were, political, adversaries, not, cannibals, upon, leaving, the, bench, maniu, walked, toward, antonescu, and, shook, his, hand, ion, antonescu, was, found, guilty, of, the, charges, this, verdict, was, followed, by, two, sets, of, appeals, which, claimed, that, the, restored, and, amended, 1923, constitution, did, not, offer, a, framework, for, the, people, s, tribunals, and, prevented, capital, punishment, during, peacetime, while, noting, that, contrary, to, the, armistice, agreement, only, one, power, represented, within, the, allied, commission, had, supervised, the, tribunal, they, were, both, rejected, within, six, days, in, compliance, with, a, legal, deadline, on, the, completion, of, trials, by, the, people, s, tribunals, king, michael, subsequently, received, pleas, for, clemency, from, antonescu, s, lawyer, and, his, mother, and, reputedly, considered, asking, the, allies, to, reassess, the, case, as, part, of, the, actual, nuremberg, trials, taking, romanian, war, criminals, into, foreign, custody, subjected, to, pressures, by, the, new, soviet, backed, petru, groza, executive, he, issued, a, decree, in, favour, of, execution, together, with, his, co, defendants, mihai, antonescu, alexianu, and, vasiliu, the, former, conduc, tor, was, executed, by, a, military, firing, squad, on, 1, june, 1946, ion, antonescu, s, supporters, circulated, false, rumours, that, regular, soldiers, had, refused, to, fire, at, their, commander, and, that, the, squad, was, mostly, composed, of, jewish, policemen, another, apologetic, claim, insists, that, he, himself, ordered, the, squad, to, shoot, but, footage, of, the, event, has, proven, it, false, however, he, did, refuse, a, blindfold, and, raised, his, hat, in, salute, once, the, order, was, given, the, execution, site, some, distance, away, from, the, locality, of, jilava, and, the, prison, fort, was, known, as, valea, piersicilor, valley, of, the, peach, trees, his, final, written, statement, was, a, letter, to, his, wife, urging, her, to, withdraw, into, a, convent, while, stating, the, belief, that, posterity, would, reconsider, his, deeds, and, accusing, romanians, of, being, ungrateful, antonescu, s, policies, were, motivated, in, large, part, by, ethnic, nationalism, a, firm, believer, in, the, restoration, of, greater, romania, as, the, union, of, lands, inhabited, by, ethnic, romanians, he, never, reconciled, himself, to, hungary, s, incorporation, of, northern, transylvania, although, hungary, and, romania, were, technically, allied, through, the, axis, system, their, relationship, was, always, tense, and, marked, by, serious, diplomatic, incidents, the, romanian, leader, kept, contacts, with, representatives, of, ethnic, romanian, communities, directly, affected, by, the, second, vienna, award, including, transylvanian, greek, catholic, clergy, another, aspect, of, antonescu, s, nationalist, policies, was, evidenced, after, the, balkans, campaign, antonescu, s, romania, did, not, partake, in, the, military, action, but, laid, a, claim, to, the, territories, in, eastern, vojvodina, western, banat, and, the, timok, valley, home, to, a, sizeable, romanian, community, reportedly, germany, s, initial, designs, of, granting, vojvodina, to, hungary, enhanced, the, tensions, between, antonescu, and, mikl, s, horthy, to, the, point, where, war, between, the, two, countries, became, a, possibility, such, incidents, made, germany, indefinitely, prolong, its, occupation, of, the, region, the, romanian, authorities, issued, projects, for, an, independent, macedonia, with, autonomy, for, its, aromanian, communities, while, an, official, memorandum, on, the, timok, valley, approved, by, antonescu, made, mention, of, romanian, areas, from, timok, to, salonika, the, conduc, tor, also, maintained, contacts, with, aromanian, fascists, in, axis, occupied, greece, awarding, refuge, to, alcibiades, diamandi, and, nicola, matussi, of, the, roman, legion, whose, pro, romanian, policies, had, brought, them, into, conflict, with, other, aromanian, factions, conduc, tor, antonescu, thought, hitler, willing, to, revise, his, stance, on, northern, transylvania, and, claimed, to, have, obtained, the, german, leader, s, agreement, using, it, to, justify, participation, on, the, eastern, front, after, the, recovery, of, bessarabia, however, transcripts, of, the, hitler, antonescu, conversations, do, not, validate, his, interpretation, another, version, has, it, that, hitler, sent, antonescu, a, letter, informing, him, that, bessarabia, s, political, status, still, ultimately, depended, on, german, decisions, in, one, of, his, letters, to, hitler, antonescu, himself, stated, his, anti, communist, ideological, motivation, i, confirm, that, i, will, pursue, operations, in, the, east, to, the, end, against, that, great, enemy, of, civilization, of, europe, and, of, my, country, russian, bolshevism, i, will, not, be, swayed, by, anyone, not, to, extend, this, military, cooperation, into, new, territory, antonescu, s, ideological, perspective, blended, national, sentiment, with, generically, christian, and, particularly, romanian, orthodox, traits, british, historian, arnold, d, harvey, writes, that, while, this, ideology, seems, a, poor, match, with, nazi, doctrine, especially, its, anti, religious, elements, it, seems, that, hitler, was, not, even, perturbed, by, the, militant, christian, orientation, of, the, antonescu, regime, it, is, also, possible, that, contrary, to, antonescu, s, own, will, hitler, viewed, the, transfer, of, transnistria, as, compensation, for, the, transylvanian, areas, and, that, he, therefore, considered, the, matter, closed, according, to, the, romanian, representative, in, berlin, raoul, bossy, various, german, and, hungarian, officials, recommended, the, extension, of, permanent, romanian, rule, into, transnistria, as, well, as, into, podolia, galicia, and, pokuttya, in, exchange, for, delivering, the, whole, of, transylvania, to, hungary, and, relocating, its, ethnic, romanian, majority, to, the, new, provinces, american, political, scientist, charles, king, writes, there, was, never, any, attempt, to, annex, the, occupied, territory, for, it, was, generally, considered, by, the, romanian, government, to, be, a, temporary, buffer, zone, between, greater, romania, and, the, soviet, front, line, at, his, 1946, trial, antonescu, claimed, that, transnistria, had, been, occupied, to, prevent, romania, being, caught, in, a, pincer, between, germany, s, drang, nach, osten, and, the, volksdeutsch, communities, to, the, east, while, denying, charges, of, having, exploited, the, region, for, romania, s, benefit, romanian, historian, lucian, boia, believes, that, ion, antonescu, may, have, nevertheless, had, expansionist, goals, to, the, east, and, that, he, implicitly, understood, operation, barbarossa, as, a, tool, for, containing, slavic, peoples, similar, verdicts, are, provided, by, other, researchers, another, romanian, historian, ottmar, tra, c, argues, that, antonescu, did, not, wish, to, annex, the, region, at, least, until, the, end, of, the, war, but, notes, that, antonescu, s, own, statements, make, reference, to, its, incorporation, in, the, event, of, a, victory, in, addition, to, early, annexation, plans, to, the, southern, bug, reportedly, confessed, to, bossy, in, june, 1941, the, conduc, tor, is, known, to, have, presented, his, ministers, with, designs, for, the, region, s, colonization, the, motivation, he, cited, was, alleged, malnutrition, among, romanian, peasants, to, which, he, added, i, ll, take, this, population, i, ll, lead, it, into, transnistria, where, i, shall, give, it, all, the, land, it, requires, several, nationalists, sympathetic, to, antonescu, acclaimed, the, extension, of, romanian, rule, into, transnistria, which, they, understood, as, permanent, a, recurring, element, in, antonescu, s, doctrines, is, racism, and, in, particular, antisemitism, this, was, linked, to, his, sympathy, for, ethnocratic, ideals, and, complemented, by, his, statements, in, favor, of, integral, nationalism, and, romanianism, like, other, far, right, romanians, he, saw, a, jewish, presence, behind, liberal, democracy, and, believed, in, the, existence, of, judeo, masonry, his, earliest, thoughts, on, codreanu, s, ideology, criticize, the, legionary, leader, for, advocating, brutal, measures, in, dealing, with, the, invasion, of, jews, and, instead, propose, the, organization, of, romanian, classes, as, a, method, for, reaching, the, same, objective, politician, aureliu, weiss, who, met, general, antonescu, during, that, interval, recalled, that, although, antisemitic, to, the, core, he, was, capable, of, restraint, in, public, according, to, historian, mihail, ionescu, the, conduc, tor, was, not, averse, to, the, iron, guard, s, legionary, principles, but, wanted, antisemitism, to, be, applied, in, an, orderly, fashion, as, opposed, to, horia, sima, s, revolutionary, ways, historian, ioan, scurtu, believes, that, during, the, legionary, rebellion, antonescu, deliberately, waited, before, stepping, in, in, order, for, the, guard, to, be, profoundly, discredited, and, for, himself, to, be, perceived, as, a, savior, in, april, 1941, he, let, his, ministers, know, that, he, was, considering, letting, the, mob, deal, with, the, jews, and, after, the, slaughter, i, will, restore, order, lucian, boia, notes, that, the, romanian, leader, was, indeed, motivated, by, antisemitic, beliefs, but, that, these, need, to, be, contextualized, in, order, to, understand, what, separates, antonescu, from, hitler, in, terms, of, radicalism, however, various, other, researchers, assess, that, by, aligning, himself, with, hitler, before, and, during, operation, barbarossa, antonescu, implicitly, agreed, with, his, thoughts, on, the, jewish, question, choosing, racial, over, religious, antisemitism, according, to, harvey, the, ia, i, pogrom, made, the, germans, evidently, willing, to, accept, that, organized, christianity, in, romania, was, very, different, from, what, it, was, in, germany, antonescu, was, a, firm, believer, in, the, conspiracy, theory, of, jewish, bolshevism, according, to, which, all, jews, were, supporters, of, communism, and, the, soviet, union, his, arguments, on, the, matter, involved, a, spurious, claim, that, during, the, 1940, retreat, from, bessarabia, the, jews, had, organized, themselves, and, attacked, romanian, soldiers, in, part, this, notion, exaggerated, unilateral, reports, of, enthusiasm, among, the, marginalized, jews, upon, the, arrival, of, red, army, troops, in, a, summer, 1941, address, to, his, ministers, antonescu, stated, the, satan, is, the, jew, is, a, battle, of, life, and, death, either, we, win, and, the, world, will, be, purified, either, they, win, and, we, will, become, their, slaves, at, around, the, same, time, he, envisaged, the, ethnic, cleansing, cleaning, out, of, jews, from, the, eastern, romanian, held, territories, however, as, early, as, february, 1941, antonescu, was, also, contemplating, the, ghettoization, of, all, jewish, romanians, as, an, early, step, toward, their, expulsion, in, this, context, antonescu, frequently, depicted, jews, as, a, disease, or, a, poison, after, the, battle, of, stalingrad, he, encouraged, the, army, commanders, to, resist, the, counteroffensive, as, otherwise, the, soviets, will, bring, bolshevism, to, the, country, wipe, out, the, entire, leadership, stratum, impose, the, jews, on, us, and, deport, masses, of, our, people, ion, antonescu, s, antiziganism, manifested, itself, as, the, claim, that, some, or, all, romani, people, specifically, nomadic, ones, were, given, to, criminal, behavior, the, regime, did, not, act, consistently, on, this, belief, in, various, cases, those, deported, had, close, relatives, drafted, into, the, romanian, army, although, racist, slogans, targeting, romani, people, had, been, popularized, by, the, iron, guard, it, was, only, under, antonescu, s, unchallenged, rule, that, solving, the, gypsy, problem, became, official, policy, and, antiziganist, measures, were, enforced, after, a, february, 1941, inspection, antonescu, singled, out, bucharest, s, romani, community, for, alleged, offences, committed, during, the, blackout, and, called, on, his, ministers, to, present, him, with, solutions, initially, he, contemplated, sending, all, romani, people, he, considered, undesirable, to, the, inhospitable, b, r, gan, plain, to, join, the, ranks, of, a, local, community, of, manual, labourers, in, 1942, he, commissioned, the, romanian, central, institute, for, statistics, to, compile, a, report, on, romani, demography, which, in, its, edited, form, provided, scientifically, racist, conclusions, warning, the, conduc, tor, about, alleged, romani, romanian, miscegenation, in, rural, romania, in, doing, so, antonescu, offered, some, credit, to, a, marginal, and, pseudoscientific, trend, in, romanian, sociology, which, basing, itself, on, eugenic, theories, recommended, the, marginalization, deportation, or, compulsory, sterilization, of, the, romani, people, whose, numeric, presence, it, usually, exaggerated, among, those, who, signed, the, report, was, demographer, sabin, manuil, who, saw, the, romani, presence, as, a, major, racial, problem, the, exact, effect, of, the, report, s, claims, on, antonescu, is, uncertain, there, is, a, historiographic, dispute, about, whether, ion, antonescu, s, regime, was, fascist, or, more, generically, right, wing, authoritarian, itself, integrated, within, a, larger, debate, about, the, aspects, and, limits, of, fascism, israeli, historian, of, fascism, zeev, sternhell, describes, antonescu, alongside, his, european, counterparts, pierre, tienne, flandin, francisco, franco, mikl, s, horthy, fran, ois, de, la, rocque, philippe, p, tain, and, italian, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, as, a, conservative, noting, that, all, of, them, were, not, deceived, by, a, propaganda, trying, to, place, them, in, the, same, category, a, similar, verdict, is, provided, by, german, historian, of, europe, hagen, schulze, who, views, horthy, franco, and, the, romanian, leader, alongside, portugal, s, estado, novo, theorist, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, and, second, polish, republic, founder, j, zef, pi, sudski, as, rulers, of, either, purely, military, dictatorships, or, else, authoritarian, governments, run, by, civilian, politicians, and, thus, a, category, apart, from, the, leaders, of, fascist, states, for, schulze, the, defining, elements, of, such, governments, is, the, presence, of, a, conservative, establishment, which, ensured, social, stability, by, extending, the, control, of, a, traditional, state, thus, effectively, blocking, revolutionary, suggestions, from, the, far, left, and, the, far, right, alike, the, term, conservative, autocrat, is, used, in, relation, to, the, conduc, tor, by, british, political, theorist, roger, griffin, who, attributes, to, the, iron, guard, the, position, of, a, subservient, fascist, movement, while, others, identify, antonescu, s, post, 1941, rule, as, a, military, rather, than, a, fascist, dictatorship, several, other, scholars, prefer, conservative, as, a, defining, term, for, antonescu, s, policies, antonescu, described, himself, as, by, fate, a, dictator, and, explained, that, his, policies, were, militaristic, or, on, one, occasion, national, totalitarian, nevertheless, other, historians, theorize, a, synthesis, of, fascist, and, conservative, elements, performed, by, antonescu, and, other, european, leaders, of, his, day, routledge, s, 2002, companion, to, fascism, and, the, far, right, uses, the, terms, para, fascist, to, define, antonescu, adding, generally, regarded, as, an, authoritarian, conservative, incorporated, fascism, into, his, regime, in, the, shape, of, the, iron, guard, rather, than, embodying, fascism, himself, para, fascist, is, also, used, by, griffin, to, denote, both, antonescu, and, carol, ii, american, historian, of, fascism, robert, paxton, notes, that, like, salazar, romania, s, dictator, crushed, a, competing, fascist, movement, after, copying, some, of, techniques, of, popular, mobilization, political, scientists, john, gledhill, and, charles, king, discuss, the, iron, guard, as, romania, s, indigenous, fascist, movement, remark, that, antonescu, adopted, much, of, the, ideology, of, the, guardists, and, conclude, that, the, regime, he, led, was, openly, fascist, references, to, the, fascist, traits, of, antonescu, s, dictatorship, are, also, made, by, other, researchers, the, synthetic, aspect, of, antonescu, s, rule, is, discussed, in, detail, by, various, authors, british, historian, dennis, deletant, who, notes, that, the, fascist, label, relies, on, both, antonescu, s, adoption, of, some, fascist, trappings, and, the, dichotomy, of, wartime, and, postwar, evaluation, of, his, regime, also, notes, that, post, 1960, interpretations, do, more, to, explain, his, behaviour, than, the, preceding, orthodoxy, deletant, contrasts, the, lack, of, mass, political, party, or, ideology, with, the, type, of, rule, associated, with, nazism, or, italian, fascism, british, born, sociologist, and, political, analyst, michael, mann, writes, the, authoritarian, regimes, of, antonescu, and, franco, purported, to, be, traditional, but, actually, their, fascist, derived, corporatism, was, a, new, immanent, ideology, of, the, right, another, distinct, view, is, held, by, romanian, born, historian, of, ideas, juliana, geran, pilon, who, describes, romania, s, military, fascist, regime, as, a, successor, to, iron, guardist, mystical, nationalism, while, mentioning, that, antonescu, s, national, ideology, was, rather, more, traditionally, militaristic, and, conservative, in, theory, antonescu, s, policies, had, at, least, one, revolutionary, aspect, the, leader, himself, claimed, i, want, to, introduce, a, patriotic, heroic, military, typed, education, because, economic, education, and, all, the, others, follow, from, it, according, to, boia, his, arrival, in, power, was, explicitly, meant, to, regenerate, romania, and, his, popularity, hinged, on, his, being, perceived, as, a, totalitarian, model, and, a, saviour, figure, like, corneliu, zelea, codreanu, and, carol, ii, before, him, the, providential, and, saviour, themes, are, also, emphasized, by, historian, adrian, majuru, who, notes, that, antonescu, both, adopted, such, ideals, and, criticized, carol, for, failing, to, live, up, to, them, seeing, his, rule, as, legitimized, by, the, national, interest, the, general, is, also, known, to, have, referred, to, political, pluralism, as, poltronerie, poltroonishness, accordingly, antonescu, formally, outlawed, all, political, forces, in, february, 1941, codifying, penal, labor, as, punishment, for, most, public, forms, of, political, expression, in, deletant, s, assessment, his, regenerative, program, was, more, declarative, than, factual, and, contradicted, by, antonescu, s, own, decision, to, allow, the, informal, existence, of, some, opposition, forces, at, the, same, time, some, historians, believe, his, monopolizing, of, power, in, the, name, of, a, german, alliance, turned, romania, into, either, a, puppet, state, of, hitler, or, one, of, germany, s, satellite, governments, however, deletant, notes, romania, retained, her, sovereignty, throughout, the, period, of, the, alliance, antonescu, had, of, course, his, own, country, s, interests, uppermost, in, his, mind, but, in, following, hitler, he, served, the, nazi, cause, he, describes, romania, s, contribution, to, the, war, as, that, of, a, principal, ally, of, germany, as, opposed, to, a, minor, axis, satellite, although, he, assigned, an, unimportant, role, to, king, michael, antonescu, took, steps, to, increase, the, monarchy, s, prestige, personally, inviting, carol, s, estranged, wife, queen, mother, helen, to, return, home, however, his, preferred, military, structures, functioned, in, cooperation, with, a, bureaucracy, inherited, from, the, national, renaissance, front, according, to, historian, of, fascism, philip, morgan, antonescu, probably, wanted, to, create, or, perpetuate, something, like, carol, s, front, organization, much, of, his, permanent, support, base, comprised, former, national, christian, party, members, to, the, point, where, he, was, seen, as, successor, to, octavian, goga, while, maintaining, a, decorative, replacement, for, parliament, known, as, adunarea, ob, teasc, plebiscitar, a, na, iunii, rom, ne, the, general, plebiscitary, assembly, of, the, romanian, nation, and, convoked, only, twice, he, took, charge, of, hierarchical, appointments, and, personally, drafted, new, administrative, projects, in, 1941, he, disestablished, participative, government, in, localities, and, counties, replacing, it, with, a, corporatist, structure, appointed, by, prefects, whom, he, named, in, stages, between, august, and, october, 1941, he, instituted, civilian, administration, of, transnistria, under, governor, gheorghe, alexianu, whose, status, he, made, equivalent, to, that, of, a, cabinet, minister, similar, measures, were, taken, in, bukovina, and, bessarabia, under, governors, corneliu, calotescu, and, gheorghe, voiculescu, respectively, antonescu, strictly, relied, on, the, chain, of, command, and, his, direct, orders, to, the, army, overrode, civilian, hierarchies, this, system, allowed, room, for, endemic, political, corruption, and, administrative, confusion, the, romanian, leader, also, tolerated, a, gradual, loss, of, authority, over, the, german, communities, in, romania, in, particular, the, transylvanian, saxon, and, banat, swabian, groups, in, agreement, with, hitler, s, views, on, the, volksdeutsche, this, trend, was, initiated, by, saxon, nazi, activist, andreas, schmidt, in, cooperation, with, the, volksdeutsche, mittelstelle, resulting, in, de, facto, self, governance, under, a, nazi, system, which, was, also, replicated, among, the, 130, 000, black, sea, germans, of, transnistria, many, young, german, romanian, men, opted, to, join, the, schutzstaffel, as, early, as, 1940, and, in, 1943, an, accord, between, antonescu, and, hitler, automatically, sent, ethnic, germans, of, recruitable, age, into, the, wehrmacht, the, regime, was, characterized, by, the, leader, s, attempts, to, regulate, even, remote, aspects, of, public, life, including, relations, between, the, sexes, he, imposed, drastic, penalties, for, misdemeanors, and, the, legal, use, of, capital, punishment, was, extended, to, an, unprecedented, level, he, personally, set, standards, for, nightclub, programs, for, the, length, of, skirts, and, for, women, s, use, of, bicycles, while, forcing, all, men, to, wear, coats, in, public, his, wife, maria, was, a, patron, of, state, approved, charitable, organizations, initially, designed, to, compete, with, successful, iron, guardist, ventures, such, as, ajutorul, legionar, according, to, romanian, born, gender, studies, academic, maria, bucur, although, the, regime, allowed, women, to, participate, in, the, war, effort, on, the, front, in, a, more, regularized, if, still, marginal, fashion, the, general, tone, was, sexist, the, administrative, apparatus, included, official, press, and, propaganda, sectors, which, moved, rapidly, from, constructing, carol, s, personality, cult, to, doing, the, same, for, the, new, military, leader, journals, universul, and, timpul, as, well, as, camil, petrescu, s, rom, nia, magazine, were, particularly, active, in, this, process, some, other, such, venues, were, porunca, vremii, nichifor, crainic, s, sfarm, piatr, as, well, as, all, the, seemingly,

notable, and, virulent, at, the, level, of, romanian, army, units, addressing, former, soviet, citizens, in, occupied, lands, and, reflected, the, regime, s, preference, for, the, ethnic, slur,

crusade, romania, s, other, enemies, were, generally, treated, differently, antonescu, himself, issued, objections, to, the, anti, british, propaganda, of, explicitly, pro, nazi, papers, such, as, porunca, vremii, a, special, segment, of, antonescu, s, post, 1941, propaganda, was, codrenist, it, revisited, the, iron, guard, s, history, to, minimize, sima, s, contributions, and, to, depict, him, as, radically, different, from, codreanu, three, weeks, after, gaining, power, and, inaugurating, the, national, legionary, regime, ion, antonescu, declared, to, italian, interviewers, at, la, stampa, that, solving, the, jewish, question, was, his, pressing, concern, and, that, he, considered, himself, haunted, by, the, large, jewish, presence, in, moldavian, towns, antonescu, s, crimes, against,

supervision, of, a, national, center, and, their, scope, was, extended, often, discussed, as, a, prelude, to, the, holocaust, in, romania, and, in, connection, with, antonescu, s, views, on, jewish, bolshevism, the, ia, i, pogrom, occurred, just, days, after, the, start, of, operation, barbarossa, and, was, partly, instigated, partly, tolerated, by, the, authorities, in, bucharest, for, a, while, before, the, massacre, these, issued, propaganda, claiming, that, the, jews, in, ia, i, whose, numbers, had, been, increased, by, forced, evictions, from, smaller, localities, were, actively, helping,

some, assistance, in, their, murder, was, provided, by, units, of, the, german, xxxth, army, corps, a, matter, which, later, allowed, the, authorities, to, shift, blame, from, themselves, and, from, antonescu, who, was, nonetheless, implicated, by, the, special, orders, he, had, released, the, complicity, of, the, special, intelligence, service, and, its, director, eugen, cristescu, was, also, advanced, as, a, possibility, the, subsequent, attempts, at, a, cover, up, included, omissive, explanations, given, by, the, central, authorities, to, foreign, diplomats, and, rewriting, official,

if, we, appear, in, history, as, barbarians, there, has, never, been, a, time, more, suitable, in, our, history, to, get, rid, of, the, jews, and, if, necessary, you, are, to, make, use, of, machine, guns, against, them, he, also, explained, that, his, aim, was, the, policy, of, purification, of, the, romanian, race, and, i, will, not, give, way, before, any, obstacle, in, achieving, this,

when, he, ordered, the, transnistrian, deportation, of, romanian, romani, from, the, old, kingdom, transited, through, camps, and, resettled, in, inhumane, conditions, near, the, southern, bug, they, were, joined, there, by, 2, 000, conscientious, objectors, of, the, inochentist, church, a, millennialist, denomination, as, antonescu, admitted, during, his, trial, he, personally, supervised, these, operations, giving, special, orders, to, the, gendarmerie, commanders, in, theory, the, measures, taken, against, romani, people, were, supposed, to, affect, only, nomads, and, those, with, a, criminal, record, created, or, updated, recently, but, arbitrary, exceptions, were, immediately, made, to, this, rule, in, particular, by, using, the, vague, notion, of, undesirable, to, define, some, members, of, sedentary, communities, the, central, authorities, noted, differences, in, the, criteria, applied, locally, and, intervened, to, prevent, or, sanction, under, deportation, and, in, some, cases, over, deportation, antonescu, and, constantin, vasiliu, had, been, made, aware, of, the, problems, transnistria, faced, in, feeding, its, own, population, but, ignored, them, when, deciding, in, favour, of, expulsion, with, most, of, their, property, confiscated, the, romani, men, women, and, children, were, only, allowed, to, carry, hand, luggage, on, which, they, were, supposed, to, survive, winter, famine, and, disease, ensued, from, criminal, negligence, romani, survival, being, largely, dependent, on, occasional, government, handouts, the, locals, charity, stealing, and, an, underground, economy, once, caught, escapees, who, made, their, way, back, into, romania, were, returned, by, the, central, authorities, even, as, local, authorities, were, objecting, the, odessa, massacre, an, act, of, collective, punishment, carried, out, by, the, romanian, army, and, gendarmes, took, the, lives, of, a, minimum, of, between, 15, 000, and, 25, 000, to, as, many, as, 40, 000, or, even, more, than, 50, 000, jewish, people, of, all, ages, the, measure, came, as, the, enforcement, of, antonescu, s, own, orders, as, retaliation, for, an, explosion, that, killed, 67, people, at, romanian, headquarters, on, that, city, antonescu, believed, that, the, original, explosion, was, a, terrorist, act, rejecting, the, possibility, of, the, building, in, question, having, been, fitted, with, land, mines, by, the, retreating, soviets, in, addition, antonescu, blamed, the, jews, specifically, jewish, commissars, in, the, red, army, for, the, losses, suffered, by, his, 4th, army, throughout, the, siege, although, both, an, inquiry, he, had, ordered, and, german, assessments, pointed, to, the, ill, preparedness, of, romanian, soldiers, while, the, local, command, took, the, initiative, for, the, first, executions, antonescu, s, personal, intervention, amplified, the, number, of, victims, required, and, included, specific, quotas, 200, civilians, for, every, dead, officer, 100, for, every, dead, soldier, by, the, time, of, the, explosion, the, jewish, population, was, already, rounded, up, into, makeshift, ghettos, being, made, subject, to, violence, and, selective, murders, purportedly, the, largest, single, massacre, of, jews, in, the, war, s, history, it, involved, mass, shootings, hangings, acts, of, immolation, and, a, mass, detonation, antonescu, is, quoted, saying, that, the, romanian, army, s, criminal, acts, were, reprisals, not, massacres, survivors, were, deported, to, the, nearby, settlement, of, slobidka, and, kept, in, inhumane, conditions, alexianu, himself, intervened, with, antonescu, for, a, solution, to, their, problems, but, the, romanian, leader, decided, he, wanted, them, out, of, the, odessa, area, citing, the, nearby, resistance, of, soviet, troops, in, the, siege, of, sevastopol, as, a, ferment, for, similar, jewish, activities, his, order, to, alexianu, specified, pack, them, into, the, catacombs, throw, them, into, the, black, sea, but, get, them, out, of, odessa, i, don, t, want, to, know, a, hundred, can, die, a, thousand, can, die, all, of, them, can, die, but, i, don, t, want, a, single, romanian, official, or, officer, to, die, defining, the, presence, of, jews, in, occupied, odessa, as, a, crime, antonescu, added, i, don, t, want, to, stain, my, activity, with, such, lack, of, foresight, as, a, result, of, this, around, 35, 000, 40, 000, jewish, people, were, deported, out, of, odessa, area, and, into, other, sectors, of, transnistria, several, thousands, were, purposefully, driven, into, berezivka, and, other, areas, inhabited, by, the, black, sea, germans, where, selbstschutz, organizations, massacred, them, a, common, assessment, ranks, antonescu, s, romania, as, second, only, to, nazi, germany, in, its, antisemitic, extermination, policies, according, to, separate, works, by, historians, dennis, deletant, and, adrian, cioroianu, the, flaws, of, antonescu, s, 1946, trial, notwithstanding, his, responsibility, for, war, crimes, was, such, that, he, would, have, been, equally, likely, to, be, found, guilty, and, executed, in, a, western, allied, jurisdiction, the, often, singular, brutality, of, romanian, organized, massacres, was, a, special, topic, of, reflection, for, jewish, holocaust, escapee, and, american, political, theorist, hannah, arendt, as, discussed, in, her, 1963, work, eichmann, in, jerusalem, official, romanian, estimates, made, in, 2003, by, the, wiesel, commission, mention, that, between, 280, 000, and, 380, 000, jews, were, killed, by, romanian, authorities, under, antonescu, s, rule, the, transnistria, deportations, account, for, 150, 000, to, 170, 000, individual, expulsions, of, jews, from, romania, proper, of, whom, some, 90, 000, 120, 000, never, returned, according, to, romanian, born, israeli, historian, jean, ancel, the, transnistria, deportations, from, other, areas, account, for, around, 145, 000, deaths, while, the, number, of, local, transnistrian, jews, killed, could, be, as, high, as, 280, 000, more, conservative, estimates, for, the, latter, number, mention, some, 130, 000, 180, 000, victims, other, overall, estimates, speak, of, 200, 000, to, over, 300, 000, jews, purposefully, killed, as, a, result, of, romania, s, action, according, to, historians, antony, polonsky, and, joanna, b, michlic, none, of, these, massacres, was, carried, out, by, the, germans, although, certainly, encouraged, such, actions, and, in, some, cases, may, have, coordinated, them, the, romani, deportations, affected, some, 25, 000, people, at, least, 11, 000, of, whom, died, in, transnistria, the, jewish, population, in, the, old, kingdom, numbering, between, 300, 000, and, 400, 000, people, survived, the, holocaust, almost, intact, reflecting, on, this, fact, lucian, boia, noted, that, antonescu, could, not, decently, be, viewed, as, a, rescuer, of, jews, but, that, there, still, is, a, fundamental, difference, between, the, effects, of, his, rule, and, those, of, hitler, s, concluding, that, the, overall, picture, is, not, completely, dark, for, dennis, deletant, this, situation, is, a, major, paradox, of, antonescu, s, time, in, power, more, jews, survived, under, rule, than, in, any, other, country, within, axis, europe, american, historian, of, romania, william, o, oldson, views, antonescu, s, policies, as, characterized, by, violence, inconsistency, and, inanity, but, places, them, in, the, wider, context, of, local, antisemitism, noting, some, ideological, exceptions, from, their, respective, european, counterparts, these, traits, he, argues, became, providential, for, the, more, assimilated, jewish, communities, of, the, old, romanian, kingdom, while, exposing, jews, perceived, as, foreign, discussing, antonescu, s, policy, of, ethnic, cleansing, polonksy, and, mihlic, note, raises, important, questions, about, the, thin, line, between, the, desire, to, expel, an, unwanted, minority, and, a, small, scale, genocidal, project, under, sanctioned, conditions, american, military, historian, gerhard, l, weinberg, made, reference, to, the, antonescu, regime, s, slaughter, of, large, number, of, jews, in, the, areas, ceded, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1940, when, those, areas, were, retaken, in, 1941, as, well, as, in, transnistria, but, commented, the, government, of, marshal, ion, antonescu, preferred, to, rob, and, persecute, jews, the, government, would, not, turn, them, over, to, the, germans, for, killing, alongside, the, noticeable, change, in, fortunes, on, the, eastern, front, a, main, motivator, for, all, post, 1943, changes, noted, by, various, historians, was, the, manifold, financial, opportunity, of, jewish, survival, wealthier, jews, were, financially, extorted, in, order, to, avoid, community, work, and, deportation, and, the, work, of, some, professionals, was, harnessed, by, the, public, sector, and, even, by, the, army, from, the, beginning, the, regime, had, excepted, from, deportations, some, jews, who, were, experts, in, fields, such, as, forestry, and, chemistry, and, some, others, were, even, allowed, to, return, despite, antisemitic, protests, in, their, home, provinces, economic, exploitation, was, institutionalized, in, late, 1941, early, 1942, with, the, creation, of, a, central, jewish, office, supervised, by, commissioner, radu, lecca, and, formally, led, by, the, jewish, intellectuals, nandor, gingold, and, henric, streitman, it, collected, funds, which, were, in, part, redirected, toward, maria, antonescu, s, charities, small, numbers, of, romanian, jews, left, independently, for, the, palestine, as, early, as, 1941, but, british, opposition, to, zionist, plans, made, their, transfer, perilous, one, notorious, example, of, this, being, the, mv, struma, on, a, personal, level, antonescu, s, encouragement, of, crimes, alternated, with, periods, when, he, gave, in, to, the, pleas, of, jewish, community, leader, wilhelm, filderman, in, one, such, instance, he, reversed, his, own, 1942, decision, to, impose, the, wearing, of, yellow, badges, which, nevertheless, remained, in, use, everywhere, outside, the, old, kingdom, and, in, theory, to, any, romanian, jews, elsewhere, in, axis, controlled, europe, assessing, these, contradictions, commentators, also, mention, the, effect, of, allied, promises, to, prosecute, those, responsible, for, genocide, throughout, europe, in, the, late, stages, of, the, war, antonescu, was, attempting, to, shift, all, blame, for, crimes, from, his, regime, while, accusing, jews, of, bring, destruction, upon, themselves, the, regime, permitted, non, deported, romanian, jews, and, american, charities, to, send, humanitarian, aid, into, transnistrian, camps, a, measure, it, took, an, interest, in, enforcing, in, late, 1942, deportations, of, jews, ceased, altogether, in, october, of, the, same, year, a, common, explanation, historians, propose, for, this, reassessment, of, policies, is, the, change, in, germany, s, fortunes, on, the, eastern, front, with, mention, that, antonescu, was, considering, using, the, jewish, population, as, an, asset, in, his, dealings, with, the, western, allies, it, nevertheless, took, the, regime, more, than, a, year, to, allow, more, selective, jewish, returns, from, transnistria, including, some, 2, 000, orphans, after, transnistria, s, 1944, evacuation, antonescu, himself, advocated, the, creation, of, new, camps, in, bessarabia, in, conversations, with, his, cabinet, the, conduc, tor, angrily, maintained, that, surviving, jews, were, better, off, than, romanian, soldiers, the, policies, applied, in, respect, to, the, romani, population, were, ambivalent, while, ordering, the, deportation, of, those, he, considered, criminals, ion, antonescu, was, taking, some, interest, in, improving, the, lives, of, romani, laborers, of, the, b, r, gan, plain, according, to, romanian, historian, viorel, achim, although, it, had, claimed, the, existence, of, a, gypsy, problem, the, antonescu, regime, did, not, count, it, among, its, priorities, by, 1943, antonescu, was, gradually, allowing, those, deported, to, return, home, initially, constantin, vasiliu, allowed, the, families, of, soldiers, to, appeal, their, deportation, on, a, selective, basis, romanian, authorities, also, appear, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, objections, of, nazi, administrators, in, the, reichskommissariat, ukraine, who, feared, that, the, newly, arrived, population, would, outnumber, local, germans, by, january, 1944, the, central, authorities, ordered, local, ones, not, to, send, back, apprehended, fugitives, instructed, them, to, provide, these, with, some, food, and, clothing, and, suggested, corporal, punishment, for, romani, people, who, did, not, adhere, to, a, behavioural, code, as, the, romanian, administrators, abandoned, transnistria, most, survivors, from, the, group, returned, on, their, own, in, summer, 1944, ion, antonescu, and, his, subordinates, were, for, long, divided, on, the, issue, of, the, final, solution, as, applied, in, territories, under, direct, nazi, control, from, 1941, at, an, early, stage, german, attempts, to, impose, the, rsha, s, direct, control, over, old, kingdom, jews, drew, some, objections, from, mihai, antonescu, but, the, two, sides, agreed, to, a, common, policy, with, reference, to, soviet, jews, in, various, of, his, early, 1940s, statements, ion, antonescu, favorably, mentions, the, axis, goal, of, eliminating, the, jewish, presence, in, the, event, of, victory, the, unrestrained, character, of, some, romanian, actions, toward, jews, alarmed, nazi, officials, who, demanded, a, methodical, form, of, extermination, when, confronted, with, german, decisions, to, push, back, jews, he, had, expelled, before, the, occupation, of, transnistria, antonescu, protested, arguing, that, he, had, conformed, with, hitler, s, decisions, regarding, eastern, jews, in, august, 1941, in, preparation, for, the, final, solution, s, universal, application, hitler, remarked, as, for, the, jewish, question, today, in, any, case, one, could, say, that, a, man, like, antonescu, for, example, proceeds, much, more, radically, in, this, manner, than, we, have, done, until, now, but, i, will, not, rest, or, be, idle, until, we, too, have, gone, all, the, way, with, the, jews, by, summer, 1942, german, representatives, in, romania, obtained, antonescu, s, approval, to, deport, the, remaining, jewish, population, to, extermination, camps, in, occupied, poland, among, those, involved, on, the, german, side, were, mass, murderer, adolf, eichmann, and, his, aide, gustav, richter, while, the, romanian, side, was, represented, by, jewish, affairs, commissioner, lecca, reporting, to, antonescu, himself, richter, directed, lecca, in, setting, up, the, central, jewish, office, which, he, assumed, would, function, as, a, judenrat, to, streamline, extermination, policies, according, to, such, plans, only, some, 17, 000, jews, labeled, useful, to, romania, s, economy, were, to, be, exempt, the, transports, had, already, been, announced, to, the, romanian, railways, by, autumn, 1942, but, the, government, eventually, decided, to, postpone, these, measures, indefinitely, as, was, done, with, most, other, deportations, to, transnistria, antonescu, s, new, orders, on, the, matter, were, brought, up, in, his, conversations, with, hitler, at, schloss, klessheim, where, both, leaders, show, themselves, aware, of, the, fate, awaiting, jewish, deportees, to, poland, by, then, german, authorities, charged, with, applying, the, final, solution, in, eastern, europe, completely, abandoned, their, plans, with, respect, to, romania, in, august, 1942, antonescu, had, worked, out, plans, with, the, ss, for, deporting, all, of, the, jews, of, the, regat, or, the, old, kingdom, to, the, german, run, death, camps, in, poland, but, then, cancelled, the, deportation, the, principal, reasons, for, his, change, of, mind, were, signs, of, disapproval, from, court, circles, a, warning, from, the, american, government, passed, on, by, the, swiss, ambassador, that, he, would, prosecuted, for, war, crimes, and, crimes, against, humanity, after, the, allies, had, won, if, the, deportation, went, ahead, and, most, importantly, because, hitler, would, not, undo, the, second, vienna, award, and, return, northern, transylvania, to, romania, antonescu, saw, the, deportation, of, the, jews, of, the, regat, as, the, pro, quid, quo, for, the, return, of, transylvania, and, unable, to, obtain, satisfactory, promises, from, the, german, ambassador, baron, manfred, von, killinger, that, romania, would, be, rewarded, with, the, return, of, transylvania, in, exchange, for, handing, over, its, jews, antonescu, cancelled, the, deportation, until, the, germans, would, make, him, a, better, offer, according, to, oldson, by, the, final, stage, of, the, war, romania, rejected, all, extreme, measures, against, jews, who, could, not, be, proven, to, be, communists, the, planned, transports, to, palestine, the, prospect, of, which, irritated, nazi, german, observers, implied, a, hope, that, the, allies, focus, would, shift, away, from, the, regime, s, previous, guilt, and, at, the, same, time, looked, forward, to, payments, to, be, made, in, exchange, for, each, person, saved, the, contrary, implications, of, romanian, nationalism, manifested, as, reluctance, to, obey, german, commands, and, discomfort, with, drastic, change, in, general, are, occasionally, offered, as, further, explanations, of, the, phenomenon, while, reflecting, upon, the, issue, of, emigration, to, palestine, antonescu, also, yielded, to, pleas, of, jewish, community, leaders, and, allowed, safe, passage, through, romania, for, various, northern, transylvanian, jews, fleeing, the, holocaust, in, hungary, he, was, doing, the, same, for, certain, northern, transylvanian, romani, communities, who, had, escaped, southwards, in, that, context, nazi, german, ideologues, began, objecting, to, antonescu, s, supposed, leniency, antonescu, nevertheless, alternated, tolerance, of, illegal, immigration, with, drastic, measures, in, early, 1944, he, issued, an, order, to, shoot, illegal, immigrants, which, was, probably, never, enforced, by, the, border, police, who, occasionally, turned, in, jewish, refugees, to, the, german, authorities, the, antonescu, regime, allowed, the, extermination, of, the, romanian, jewish, diaspora, in, other, parts, of, europe, formally, opposing, their, deportation, in, some, cases, where, it, appeared, germany, was, impinging, upon, romania, s, sovereignty, the, circumstances, of, wartime, accounted, for, cautious, and, ambivalent, approaches, to, antonescu, s, rule, from, among, the, romanian, political, mainstream, which, grouped, advocates, of, liberal, democracy, and, anti, fascism, according, to, gledhill, and, king, romanian, liberals, had, been, critical, of, their, government, s, warm, relationship, with, hitler, which, had, been, developing, throughout, the, 1930s, but, the, soviet, attack, on, romanian, territory, left, them, with, little, chance, but, to, support, germany, s, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, other, authors, also, cite, the, greater, romanian, agenda, of, the, antonescu, executive, as, a, reason, behind, the, widespread, acquiescence, the, tendency, was, illustrated, by, dinu, br, tianu, who, in, late, january, 1941, told, his, national, liberal, colleagues, that, the, new, government, of, generals, was, the, best, solution, possible, to, the, current, crisis, urging, the, group, to, provide, antonescu, with, all, the, support, we, can, give, him, an, early, point, of, contention, between, antonescu, and, the, national, peasants, party, came, in, spring, 1941, when, antonescu, s, support, for, the, balkans, campaign, and, romania, s, claim, to, parts, of, vojvodina, were, met, with, a, letter, of, protest, from, iuliu, maniu, which, antonescu, dismissed, maniu, and, br, tianu, also, issued, several, condemnations, of, antonescu, s, decision, to, continue, the, war, beyond, the, dniester, one, such, letter, signed, by, both, claimed, that, while, earlier, steps, had, been, legitimized, by, the, entire, soul, of, the, nation, the, romanian, people, will, never, consent, to, the, continuation, of, the, struggle, beyond, our, national, borders, maniu, specifically, mentioned, the, possibility, of, allied, victory, accused, antonescu, of, diverting, attention, from, the, goal, of, greater, romania, northern, transylvania, included, and, stressed, that, romania, s, ongoing, participation, in, the, axis, was, troubling, enough, antonescu, is, known, to, have, publicly, admonished, opposition, leaders, for, their, disobedience, which, he, equated, with, obstruction, and, to, have, monitored, their, activities, through, the, special, intelligence, service, however, some, early, communiqu, s, he, addressed, to, br, tianu, also, feature, offers, of, resignation, which, their, recipient, reluctantly, rejected, the, germans, objected, to, such, ambiguities, and, hitler, once, advised, antonescu, to, have, maniu, killed, an, option, which, the, conduc, tor, rejected, because, of, the, pn, leader, s, popularity, with, the, peasants, while, tolerating, contacts, between, maniu, and, the, allies, antonescu, arrested, the, clandestine, british, envoys, to, romania, thus, putting, a, stop, to, the, 1943, operation, autonomous, in, parallel, his, relationship, with, queen, mother, helen, and, michael, rapidly, deteriorated, after, he, began, advising, the, royal, family, on, how, to, conduct, its, affairs, dissent, from, antonescu, s, policies, sometimes, came, from, inside, his, own, camp, both, the, officer, corps, and, the, general, staff, were, divided, on, the, issue, of, war, beyond, the, dniester, although, it, is, possible, that, the, majority, agreed, it, would, bring, northern, transylvania, back, to, romania, a, prominent, case, was, that, of, iosif, iacobici, the, chief, of, the, romanian, general, staff, whose, objection, to, the, massive, transfer, of, romanian, troops, to, the, eastern, front, resulted, in, his, demotion, and, replacement, with, ilie, teflea, january, 1942, teflea, issued, similar, calls, and, antonescu, s, eventually, agreed, to, preserve, a, home, army, just, before, the, battle, of, stalingrad, various, other, military, men, extended, their, protection, to, persecuted, jews, overall, antonescu, met, significant, challenges, in, exercising, control, over, the, politicized, sectors, in, the, armed, forces, antonescu, s, racial, discrimination, laws, and, romania, s, participation, in, the, holocaust, earned, significant, objections, from, various, individuals, and, groups, in, romanian, society, one, noted, opponent, was, queen, mother, helen, who, actively, intervened, to, save, jews, from, being, deported, the, mayor, of, cern, u, i, traian, popovici, publicly, objected, to, the, deportation, of, jews, as, did, gherman, p, ntea, his, counterpart, in, odessa, the, appeals, of, queen, helen, king, michael, the, orthodox, metropolitan, of, transylvania, nicolae, b, lan, apostolic, nuncio, andrea, cassulo, and, swiss, ambassador, ren, de, weck, are, credited, with, having, helped, avert, the, full, application, of, the, final, solution, in, antonescu, s, romania, cassulo, and, b, lan, together, pleaded, for, the, fate, of, certain, jews, including, all, who, had, converted, to, christianity, and, the, former, publicly, protested, against, deportations, while, romania, and, the, united, states, were, still, at, peace, american, minister, plenipotentiary, franklin, mott, gunther, repeatedly, attempted, to, make, his, superiors, aware, of, romanian, actions, against, the, jews, and, turkish, diplomats, unsuccessfully, sought, american, approval, for, transferring, romanian, jews, to, safe, passage, through, anatolia, and, into, palestine, dinu, br, tianu, also, condemned, antisemitic, measures, prompting, antonescu, to, accuse, him, of, being, an, ally, of, the, yid, in, london, together, with, maniu, and, ion, mihalache, br, tianu, signed, statements, condemning, the, isolation, persecution, and, expulsion, of, jews, which, prompted, antonescu, to, threaten, to, clamp, down, on, them, however, both, parties, were, occasionally, ambiguous, on, racial, issues, and, themselves, produced, antisemitic, messages, br, tianu, is, also, known, for, publicly, defending, the, cause, of, romani, people, opposing, their, deportation, on, grounds, that, it, would, turn, back, the, clock, on, several, centuries, of, history, a, stance, which, drew, support, from, his, civilian, peers, in, parallel, some, regular, romanians, such, as, nurse, viorica, agarici, intervened, to, save, jewish, lives, while, from, inside, the, jewish, community, chief, rabbi, alexandru, afran, and, activist, mi, u, benvenisti, rallied, with, wilhelm, filderman, in, public, protests, against, antonescu, s, decisions, being, occasionally, joined, by, a, l, zissu, in, 1943,

reportedly, jailed, in, compliance, with, his, orders, persecution, targeted, groups, of, religiously, motivated, conscientious, objectors, in, addition, to, the, inochentist, movement, these, groups, included, the, pentecostal, union, the, seventh, day, adventist, conference, and, the, jehovah, s, witnesses, association, antonescu, himself, recounted, having, contemplated, using, the, death,

war, alongside, the, allies, however, it, also, saw, the, early, stages, of, a, communist, takeover, which, culminated, with, king, michael, s, forced, abdication, on, 30, december, 1947, and, the, subsequent, establishment, of, communist, romania, the, antonescu, trial, thus, fit, into, a, long, series, of, similar, procedures, and, political, purges, on, charges, of, collaborationism, instrumented, by, the, romanian, people, s, tribunals, and, various, other, institutions, during, the, rigged, general, election, of, 1946, and, for, years, after, ion, antonescu, s, execution, the, romanian, communist, party, and, its, allies, began, using, the, implications, of, his, trial, as, an, abusive, means, of, compromising, some, of, their, political, opponents, one, such, early, example, was, iuliu, maniu, by, then, one, of, the, country, s, prominent, anti, communists, who, was, accused, of, being, a, fascist, and, an, antonescu, sympathizer, mainly, for, having, shaken, his, hand, during, the, trial, the, enlistment, of, ethnic, germans, into, nazi, german, units, as, approved, by, antonescu, was, used, as, a, pretext, for, a, soviet, led, expulsion, of, germans, from, romania, on, similar, grounds, the, soviet, occupation, forces, organized, the, capture, of, certain, romanian, citizens, as, well, as, the, return, of, war, refugees, from, romania, proper, into, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovina, both, the, arrestees, and, the, returnees, were, often, deported, deeper, into, the, soviet, union, as, part, of, its, deteriorating, relationship, with, romanian, roman, catholics, and, urged, on, by, the, soviets, the, communist, cabinet, of, petru, groza, also, deemed, apostolic, nuncio, andrea, cassulo, a, collaborator, of, antonescu, and, a, persona, non, grata, based, on, transcripts, of, the, cassulo, antonescu, conversations, it, also, used, such, allegations, to, pressure, several, greek, catholic, clergymen, into, accepting, union, with, the, romanian, orthodox, church, nevertheless, romanian, born, holocaust, historian, radu, ioanid, notes, few, romanians, involved, in, organizing, the, holocaust, were, prosecuted, and, of, those, none, were, executed, after, the, antonescu, trial, he, attributes, this, to, nationalist, resistance, within, the, administrative, and, judicial, apparatus, to, communist, fears, of, alienating, a, too, large, number, of, people, to, the, emigration, of, zionist, survivors, and, to, the, open, hostility, of, some, communists, toward, liberal, jewish, community, leaders, jews, also, faced, conflict, with, the, new, authorities, and, with, the, majority, population, as, described, by, other, researchers, there, were, nonetheless, sporadic, trials, for, holocaust, related, crimes, including, one, of, maria, antonescu, arrested, in, september, 1944, and, held, 1945, 1946, in, soviet, custody, she, was, re, arrested, at, home, in, 1950, tried, and, ultimately, found, guilty, of, economic, crimes, for, her, collaboration, with, the, central, jewish, office, five, years, later, she, was, sent, into, internal, exile, and, died, of, heart, problems, in, 1964, after, 1950, a, large, number, of, convicted, war, criminals, even, some, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, were, deemed, fit, for, social, cohabitation, that, is, fit, to, live, amongst, the, general, population, and, released, while, some, suspects, were, never, prosecuted, although, the, marxist, analytical, works, of, the, increasingly, marginalized, communist, figure, lucre, iu, p, tr, canu, make, isolated, mentions, of, the, holocaust, the, heavily, politicized, official, discourse, inspired, by, soviet, historiography, interpreted, romania, s, wartime, evolution, exclusively, based, on, the, marxist, leninist, idea, of, class, conflict, in, this, context, the, main, effort, to, document, and, expose, the, antonescu, era, massacres, came, from, jewish, romanians, this, began, in, 1945, when, jewish, journalists, marius, mircu, and, maier, rudrich, contributed, first, hand, testimonies, in, 1946, 1948, the, jewish, community, leader, matatias, carp, published, cartea, neagr, the, black, book, a, voluminous, and, detailed, account, of, all, stages, of, the, holocaust, after, forming, a, secondary, element, in, antonescu, s, indictment, the, deportation, of, romani, people, was, largely, ignored, in, official, discourse, the, communist, regime, overemphasized, the, part, played, by, the, pcr, in, king, michael, s, coup, while, commemorating, its, 23, august, date, as, a, national, holiday, the, gheorghe, gheorghiu, dej, faction, emerged, as, the, winner, of, the, interior, pcr, struggles, and, incorporated, nationalist, discourse, that, faction, claimed, a, decisive, role, in, toppling, antonescu, even, though, a, majority, of, its, members, had, been, jailed, for, most, of, the, period, in, accordance, with, stalinist, principles, censorship, produced, historical, revisionism, that, excluded, focus, on, such, negative, aspects, of, romanian, behavior, during, the, war, as, antisemitism, and, the, holocaust, and, obscured, romania, s, participation, on, the, eastern, front, beginning, in, the, mid, 1960s, when, nicolae, ceau, escu, took, power, and, embarked, on, a, national, communist, course, the, celebration, of, 23, august, as, the, inception, of, the, communist, regime, was, accompanied, by, a, contradictory, tendency, which, implied, a, gradual, rehabilitation, of, antonescu, and, his, regime, historians, who, focused, on, this, period, believe, that, the, revival, of, nationalist, tenets, and, the, relative, distance, taken, from, soviet, policies, contributed, to, the, rehabilitation, process, after, a, period, of, liberalization, the, increasingly, authoritarian, ceau, escu, regime, revived, the, established, patterns, of, personalized, rule, and, even, made, informal, use, of, the, title, conduc, tor,

both, antonescu, s, rehabilitation, and, the, national, communist, version, of, protochronism, in, contrast, much, of, dissident, culture, and, the, romanian, diaspora, embraced, the, image, of, michael, i, as, its, counterpart, to, the, increasingly, official, antonescu, myth, lucian, boia, described, this, as, the, spectacular, confrontation, between, the, two, contradictory, myths, into, historical, and, mythological, terms, a, fundamental, fissure, which, divides, the, romanian, society, of, today, topics, relating, to, the, holocaust, in, romania, were, distorted, during, the, communist, era, ceau, escu, himself, mentioned, the, number, of, survivors, of, the, deportations, some, 50, 000, people, as, a, total, number, of, victims, failed, to, mention, the, victims, ethnic, background, and, presented, most, of, them, as, communists, and, antifascists, the, regime, also, placed, emphasis, on, the, holocaust, in, northern, transylvania, where, the, final, solution, had, been, applied, by, the, germans, and, the, local, arrow, cross, party, vladimir, tism, neanu, has, said, antonescu, has, a, pseudo, sacred, aura, and, many, romanians, consider, the, attempts, to,
