formulation, of, social, contract, theory, he, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, political, philosophy, hobbes, was, born, prematurely, due, to, his, mother, s, fear, of, the, spanish, armada, his, early, life, overshadowed, by, his, father, s, departure, following, a, fight, was, taken, under, the, care, of, his, wealthy, uncle, hobbes, s, academic, journey, began,

became, a, tutor, to, the, cavendish, family, which, connected, him, to, intellectual, circles, and, initiated, his, extensive, travels, across, europe, these, experiences, including, meetings, with, figures, like, galileo, shaped, his, intellectual, development, after, returning, to, england, from, france, in, 1637, hobbes, witnessed, the, destruction, and, brutality, of, the, english, civil, war, from, 1642, to, 1651, between, parliamentarians, and, royalists, which, heavily, influenced, his, advocacy, for, governance, by, an, absolute, sovereign, in, leviathan, as, the, solution, to, human, conflict, and, societal, breakdown, aside, from, social, contract, theory, leviathan, also, popularized, ideas, such, as, the, state, of, nature, war, of, all, against, all, and, laws, of, nature, his, other, major, works, include, the, trilogy, de, cive, 1642, de, corpore, 1655, and, de, homine, 1658, as, well, as, the, posthumous, work, behemoth, 1681, hobbes, contributed, to, a, diverse, array, of, fields, including, history, jurisprudence, geometry, optics, theology, classical, translations, ethics, as, well, as, philosophy, in, general, marking, him, as, a, polymath, despite, controversies, and, challenges, including, accusations, of, atheism, and, contentious, debates, with, contemporaries, hobbes, s, work, profoundly, influenced, the, understanding, of, political, structure, and, human, nature, thomas, hobbes, was, born, on, 5, april, 1588, old, style, in, westport, now, part, of, malmesbury, in, wiltshire, england, having, been, born, prematurely, when, his, mother, heard, of, the, coming, invasion, of, the, spanish, armada, hobbes, later, reported, that, my, mother, gave, birth, to, twins, myself, and, fear, hobbes, had, a, brother, edmund, about, two, years, older, as, well, as, a, sister, anne, although, thomas, hobbes, s, childhood, is, unknown, to, a, large, extent, as, is, his, mother, s, name, it, is, known, that, hobbes, s, father, thomas, sr, was, the, vicar, of, both, charlton, and, westport, hobbes, s, father, was, uneducated, according, to, john, aubrey, hobbes, s, biographer, and, he, disesteemed, learning, thomas, sr, was, involved, in, a, fight, with, the, local, clergy, outside, his, church, forcing, him, to, leave, london, as, a, result, the, family, was, left, in, the, care, of, thomas, sr, s, older, brother, francis, a, wealthy, glove, manufacturer, with, no, family, of, his, own, hobbes, was, educated, at, westport, church, from, age, four, went, to, the, malmesbury, school, and, then, to, a, private, school, kept, by, a, young, man, named, robert, latimer, a, graduate, of, the, university, of, oxford, hobbes, was, a, good, pupil, and, between, 1601, and, 1602, he, went, to, magdalen, hall, the, predecessor, to, hertford, college, oxford, where, he, was, taught, scholastic, logic, and, mathematics, the, principal, john, wilkinson, was, a, puritan, and, had, some, influence, on, hobbes, before, going, up, to, oxford, hobbes, translated, euripides, medea, from, greek, into, latin, verse, at, university, thomas, hobbes, appears, to, have, followed, his, own, curriculum, as, he, was, little, attracted, by, the, scholastic, learning, leaving, oxford, hobbes, completed, his, b, a, degree, by, incorporation, at, st, john, s, college, cambridge, in, 1608, he, was, recommended, by, sir, james, hussey, his, master, at, magdalen, as, tutor, to, william, the, son, of, william, cavendish, baron, of, hardwick, and, later, earl, of, devonshire, and, began, a, lifelong, connection, with, that, family, william, cavendish, was, elevated, to, the, peerage, on, his, father, s, death, in, 1626, holding, it, for, two, years, before, his, death, in, 1628, his, son, also, william, likewise, became, the, 3rd, earl, of, devonshire, hobbes, served, as, a, tutor, and, secretary, to, both, men, the, 1st, earl, s, younger, brother, charles, cavendish, had, two, sons, who, were, patrons, of, hobbes, the, elder, son, william, cavendish, later, 1st, duke, of, newcastle, was, a, leading, supporter, of, charles, i, during, the, civil, war, in, which, he, personally, financed, an, army, for, the, king, having, been, governor, to, the, prince, of, wales, charles, james, duke, of, cornwall, it, was, to, this, william, cavendish, that, hobbes, dedicated, his, elements, of, law, hobbes, became, a, companion, to, the, younger, william, cavendish, and, they, both, took, part, in, a, grand, tour, of, europe, between, 1610, and, 1615, hobbes, was, exposed, to, european, scientific, and, critical, methods, during, the, tour, in, contrast, to, the, scholastic, philosophy, that, he, had, learned, in, oxford, in, venice, hobbes, made, the, acquaintance, of, fulgenzio, micanzio, an, associate, of, paolo, sarpi, a, venetian, scholar, and, statesman, his, scholarly, efforts, at, the, time, were, aimed, at, a, careful, study, of, classical, greek, and, latin, authors, the, outcome, of, which, was, in, 1628, his, edition, of, thucydides, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, first, translation, of, that, work, into, english, directly, from, a, greek, manuscript, hobbes, professed, a, deep, admiration, for, thucydides, praising, him, as, the, most, politic, historiographer, that, ever, writ, and, one, scholar, has, suggested, that, hobbes, reading, of, thucydides, confirmed, or, perhaps, crystallized, the, broad, outlines, and, many, of, the, details, of, own, thought, it, has, been, argued, that, three, of, the, discourses, in, the, 1620, publication, known, as, horae, subsecivae, observations, and, discourses, also, represent, the, work, of, hobbes, from, this, period, although, he, did, associate, with, literary, figures, like, ben, jonson, and, briefly, worked, as, francis, bacon, s, amanuensis, translating, several, of, his, essays, into, latin, he, did, not, extend, his, efforts, into, philosophy, until, after, 1629, in, june, 1628, his, employer, cavendish, then, the, earl, of, devonshire, died, of, the, plague, and, his, widow, the, countess, christian, dismissed, hobbes, hobbes, soon, in, 1629, found, work, as, a, tutor, to, gervase, clifton, the, son, of, sir, gervase, clifton, 1st, baronet, mostly, spent, in, paris, until, november, 1630, thereafter, he, again, found, work, with, the, cavendish, family, tutoring, william, cavendish, 3rd, earl, of, devonshire, the, eldest, son, of, his, previous, pupil, over, the, next, seven, years, as, well, as, tutoring, he, expanded, his, own, knowledge, of, philosophy, awakening, in, him, curiosity, over, key, philosophic, debates, he, visited, galileo, galilei, in, florence, while, he, was, under, house, arrest, upon, condemnation, in, 1636, and, was, later, a, regular, debater, in, philosophic, groups, in, paris, held, together, by, marin, mersenne, hobbes, s, first, area, of, study, was, an, interest, in, the, physical, doctrine, of, motion, and, physical, momentum, despite, his, interest, in, this, phenomenon, he, disdained, experimental, work, as, in, physics, he, went, on, to, conceive, the, system, of, thought, to, the, elaboration, of, which, he, would, devote, his, life, his, scheme, was, first, to, work, out, in, a, separate, treatise, a, systematic, doctrine, of, body, showing, how, physical, phenomena, were, universally, explicable, in, terms, of, motion, at, least, as, motion, or, mechanical, action, was, then, understood, he, then, singled, out, man, from, the, realm, of, nature, and, plants, then, in, another, treatise, he, showed, what, specific, bodily, motions, were, involved, in, the, production, of, the, peculiar, phenomena, of, sensation, knowledge, affections, and, passions, whereby, man, came, into, relation, with, man, finally, he, considered, in, his, crowning, treatise, how, men, were, moved, to, enter, into, society, and, argued, how, this, must, be, regulated, if, people, were, not, to, fall, back, into, brutishness, and, misery, thus, he, proposed, to, unite, the, separate, phenomena, of, body, man, and, the, state, hobbes, came, back, home, from, paris, in, 1637, to, a, country, riven, with, discontent, which, disrupted, him, from, the, orderly, execution, of, his, philosophic, plan, however, by, the, end, of, the, short, parliament, in, 1640, he, had, written, a, short, treatise, called, the, elements, of, law, natural, and, politic, it, was, not, published, and, only, circulated, as, a, manuscript, among, his, acquaintances, a, pirated, version, however, was, published, about, ten, years, later, although, it, seems, that, much, of, the, elements, of, law, was, composed, before, the, sitting, of, the, short, parliament, there, are, polemical, pieces, of, the, work, that, clearly, mark, the, influences, of, the, rising, political, crisis, nevertheless, many, though, not, all, elements, of, hobbes, s, political, thought, were, unchanged, between, the, elements, of, law, and, leviathan, which, demonstrates, that, the, events, of, the, english, civil, war, had, little, effect, on, his, contractarian, methodology, however, the, arguments, in, leviathan, were, modified, from, the, elements, of, law, when, it, came, to, the, necessity, of, consent, in, creating, political, obligation, hobbes, wrote, in, the, elements, of, law, that, patrimonial, kingdoms, were, not, necessarily, formed, by, the, consent, of, the, governed, while, in, leviathan, he, argued, that, they, were, this, was, perhaps, a, reflection, either, of, hobbes, s, thoughts, about, the, engagement, controversy, or, of, his, reaction, to, treatises, published, by, patriarchalists, such, as, sir, robert, filmer, between, 1640, and, 1651, when, in, november, 1640, the, long, parliament, succeeded, the, short, hobbes, felt, that, he, was, in, disfavour, due, to, the, circulation, of, his, treatise, and, fled, to, paris, he, did, not, return, for, 11, years, in, paris, he, rejoined, the, coterie, around, mersenne, and, wrote, a, critique, of, the, meditations, on, first, philosophy, of, descartes, which, was, printed, as, third, among, the, sets, of, objections, appended, with, replies, from, descartes, in, 1641, a, different, set, of, remarks, on, other, works, by, descartes, succeeded, only, in, ending, all, correspondence, between, the, two, hobbes, also, extended, his, own, works, in, a, way, working, on, the, third, section, de, cive, which, was, finished, in, november, 1641, although, it, was, initially, only, circulated, privately, it, was, well, received, and, included, lines, of, argumentation, that, were, repeated, a, decade, later, in, leviathan, he, then, returned, to, hard, work, on, the, first, two, sections, of, his, work, and, published, little, except, a, short, treatise, on, optics, tractatus, opticus, included, in, the, collection, of, scientific, tracts, published, by, mersenne, as, cogitata, physico, mathematica, in, 1644, he, built, a, good, reputation, in, philosophic, circles, and, in, 1645, was, chosen, with, descartes, gilles, de, roberval, and, others, to, referee, the, controversy, between, john, pell, and, longomontanus, over, the, problem, of, squaring, the, circle, the, english, civil, war, began, in, 1642, and, when, the, royalist, cause, began, to, decline, in, mid, 1644, many, royalists, came, to, paris, and, were, known, to, hobbes, this, revitalised, hobbes, s, political, interests, and, the, de, cive, was, republished, and, more, widely, distributed, the, printing, began, in, 1646, by, samuel, de, sorbiere, through, the, elsevier, press, in, amsterdam, with, a, new, preface, and, some, new, notes, in, reply, to, objections, in, 1647, hobbes, took, up, a, position, as, mathematical, instructor, to, the, young, charles, prince, of, wales, who, had, come, to, paris, from, jersey, around, july, this, engagement, lasted, until, 1648, when, charles, went, to, holland, the, company, of, the, exiled, royalists, led, hobbes, to, produce, leviathan, which, set, forth, his, theory, of, civil, government, in, relation, to, the, political, crisis, resulting, from, the, war, hobbes, compared, the, state, to, a, monster, leviathan, composed, of, men, created, under, pressure, of, human, needs, and, dissolved, by, civil, strife, due, to, human, passions, the, work, closed, with, a, general, review, and, conclusion, in, response, to, the, war, which, answered, the, question, does, a, subject, have, the, right, to, change, allegiance, when, a, former, sovereign, s, power, to, protect, is, irrevocably, lost, during, the, years, of, composing, leviathan, hobbes, remained, in, or, near, paris, in, 1647, he, suffered, a, near, fatal, illness, that, disabled, him, for, six, months, on, recovering, he, resumed, his, literary, task, and, completed, it, by, 1650, meanwhile, a, translation, of, de, cive, was, being, produced, scholars, disagree, about, whether, it, was, hobbes, who, translated, it, in, 1650, a, pirated, edition, of, the, elements, of, law, natural, and, politic, was, published, it, was, divided, into, two, small, volumes, human, nature, or, the, fundamental, elements, of, policie, and, de, corpore, politico, or, the, elements, of, law, moral, and, politick, in, 1651, the, translation, of, de, cive, was, published, under, the, title, philosophical, rudiments, concerning, government, and, society, also, the, printing, of, the, greater, work, proceeded, and, finally, appeared, in, mid, 1651, titled, leviathan, or, the, matter, forme, and, power, of, a, common, wealth, ecclesiastical, and, civil, it, had, a, famous, title, page, engraving, depicting, a, crowned, giant, above, the, waist, towering, above, hills, overlooking, a, landscape, holding, a, sword, and, a, crozier, and, made, up, of, tiny, human, figures, the, work, had, immediate, impact, soon, hobbes, was, more, lauded, and, decried, than, any, other, thinker, of, his, time, the, first, effect, of, its, publication, was, to, sever, his, link, with, the, exiled, royalists, who, might, well, have, killed, him, the, secularist, spirit, of, his, book, greatly, angered, both, anglicans, and, french, catholics, hobbes, appealed, to, the, revolutionary, english, government, for, protection, and, fled, back, to, london, in, winter, 1651, after, his, submission, to, the, council, of, state, he, was, allowed, to, subside, into, private, life, in, fetter, lane, in, 1658, hobbes, published, the, final, section, of, his, philosophical, system, completing, the, scheme, he, had, planned, more, than, 19, years, before, de, homine, consisted, for, the, most, part, of, an, elaborate, theory, of, vision, the, remainder, of, the, treatise, dealt, partially, with, some, of, the, topics, more, fully, treated, in, the, human, nature, and, the, leviathan, in, addition, to, publishing, some, controversial, writings, on, mathematics, including, disciplines, like, geometry, hobbes, also, continued, to, produce, philosophical, works, from, the, time, of, the, restoration, he, acquired, a, new, prominence, hobbism, became, a, byword, for, all, that, respectable, society, ought, to, denounce, the, young, king, hobbes, s, former, pupil, now, charles, ii, remembered, hobbes, and, called, him, to, the, court, to, grant, him, a, pension, of, 100, the, king, was, important, in, protecting, hobbes, when, in, 1666, the, house, of, commons, introduced, a, bill, against, atheism, and, profaneness, that, same, year, on, 17, october, 1666, it, was, ordered, that, the, committee, to, which, the, bill, was, referred, should, be, empowered, to, receive, information, touching, such, books, as, tend, to, atheism, blasphemy, and, profaneness, in, particular, the, book, of, mr, hobbes, called, the, leviathan, hobbes, was, terrified, at, the, prospect, of, being, labelled, a, heretic, and, proceeded, to, burn, some, of, his, compromising, papers, at, the, same, time, he, examined, the, actual, state, of, the, law, of, heresy, the, results, of, his, investigation, were, first, announced, in, three, short, dialogues, added, as, an, appendix, to, his, latin, translation, of, leviathan, published, in, amsterdam, in, 1668, in, this, appendix, hobbes, aimed, to, show, that, since, the, high, court, of, commission, had, been, put, down, there, remained, no, court, of, heresy, at, all, to, which, he, was, amenable, and, that, nothing, could, be, heresy, except, opposing, the, nicene, creed, which, he, maintained, leviathan, did, not, do, the, only, consequence, that, came, of, the, bill, was, that, hobbes, could, never, thereafter, publish, anything, in, england, on, subjects, relating, to, human, conduct, the, 1668, edition, of, his, works, was, printed, in, amsterdam, because, he, could, not, obtain, the, censor, s, licence, for, its, publication, in, england, other, writings, were, not, made, public, until, after, his, death, including, behemoth, the, history, of, the, causes, of, the, civil, wars, of, england, and, of, the, counsels, and, artifices, by, which, they, were, carried, on, from, the, year, 1640, to, the, year, 1662, for, some, time, hobbes, was, not, even, allowed, to, respond, whatever, his, enemies, tried, despite, this, his, reputation, abroad, was, formidable, hobbes, spent, the, last, four, or, five, years, of, his, life, with, his, patron, william, cavendish, 1st, duke, of, devonshire, at, the, family, s, chatsworth, house, estate, he, had, been, a, friend, of, the, family, since, 1608, when, he, first, tutored, an, earlier, william, cavendish, after, hobbes, s, death, many, of, his, manuscripts, would, be, found, at, chatsworth, house, his, final, works, were, an, autobiography, in, latin, verse, in, 1672, and, a, translation, of, four, books, of, the, odyssey, into, rugged, english, rhymes, that, in, 1673, led, to, a, complete, translation, of, both, iliad, and, odyssey, in, 1675, in, october, 1679, hobbes, suffered, a, bladder, disorder, and, then, a, paralytic, stroke, from, which, he, died, on, 4, december, 1679, aged, 91, at, hardwick, hall, owned, by, the, cavendish, family, his, last, words, were, said, to, have, been, a, great, leap, in, the, dark, uttered, in, his, final, conscious, moments, his, body, was, interred, in, st, john, the, baptist, s, church, ault, hucknall, in, derbyshire, hobbes, influenced, by, contemporary, scientific, ideas, had, intended, for, his, political, theory, to, be, a, quasi, geometrical, system, in, which, the, conclusions, followed, inevitably, from, the, premises, the, main, practical, conclusion, of, hobbes, s, political, theory, is, that, state, or, society, cannot, be, secure, unless, at, the, disposal, of, an, absolute, sovereign, from, this, follows, the, view, that, no, individual, can, hold, rights, of, property, against, the, sovereign, and, that, the, sovereign, may, therefore, take, the, goods, of, its, subjects, without, their, consent, this, particular, view, owes, its, significance, to, it, being, first, developed, in, the, 1630s, when, charles, i, had, sought, to, raise, revenues, without, the, consent, of, parliament, and, therefore, of, his, subjects, hobbes, rejected, one, of, the, most, famous, theses, of, aristotle, s, politics, namely, that, human, beings, are, naturally, suited, to, life, in, a, polis, and, do, not, fully, realize, their, natures, until, they, exercise, the, role, of, citizen, it, is, perhaps, also, important, to, note, that, hobbes, extrapolated, his, mechanistic, understanding, of, nature, into, the, social, and, political, realm, making, him, a, progenitor, of, the, term, social, structure, in, leviathan, hobbes, set, out, his, doctrine, of, the, foundation, of, states, and, legitimate, governments, and, creating, an, objective, science, of, morality, much, of, the, book, is, occupied, with, demonstrating, the, necessity, of, a, strong, central, authority, to, avoid, the, evil, of, discord, and, civil, war, beginning, from, a, mechanistic, understanding, of, human, beings, and, their, passions, hobbes, postulates, what, life, would, be, like, without, government, a, condition, which, he, calls, the, state, of, nature, in, that, state, each, person, would, have, a, right, or, license, to, everything, in, the, world, this, hobbes, argues, would, lead, to, a, war, of, all, against, all, bellum, omnium, contra, omnes, the, description, contains, what, has, been, called, one, of, the, best, known, passages, in, english, philosophy, which, describes, the, natural, state, humankind, would, be, in, were, it, not, for, political, community, in, such, condition, there, is, no, place, for, industry, because, the, fruit, thereof, is, uncertain, and, consequently, no, culture, of, the, earth, no, navigation, nor, use, of, the, commodities, that, may, be, imported, by, sea, no, commodious, building, no, instruments, of, moving, and, removing, such, things, as, require, much, force, no, knowledge, of, the, face, of, the, earth, no, account, of, time, no, arts, no, letters, no, society, and, which, is, worst, of, all, continual, fear, and, danger, of, violent, death, and, the, life, of, man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, in, such, states, people, fear, death, and, lack, both, the, things, necessary, to, commodious, living, and, the, hope, of, being, able, to, obtain, them, so, in, order, to, avoid, it, people, accede, to, a, social, contract, and, establish, a, civil, society, according, to, hobbes, society, is, a, population, and, a, sovereign, authority, to, whom, all, individuals, in, that, society, cede, some, right, for, the, sake, of, protection, power, exercised, by, this, authority, cannot, be, resisted, because, the, protector, s, sovereign, power, derives, from, individuals, surrendering, their, own, sovereign, power, for, protection, the, individuals, are, thereby, the, authors, of, all, decisions, made, by, the, sovereign, he, that, complaineth, of, injury, from, his, sovereign, complaineth, that, whereof, he, himself, is, the, author, and, therefore, ought, not, to, accuse, any, man, but, himself, no, nor, himself, of, injury, because, to, do, injury, to, one, s, self, is, impossible, there, is, no, doctrine, of, separation, of, powers, in, hobbes, s, discussion, he, argues, that, any, division, of, authority, would, lead, to, internal, strife, jeopardizing, the, stability, provided, by, an, absolute, sovereign, according, to, hobbes, the, sovereign, must, control, civil, military, judicial, and, ecclesiastical, powers, even, the, words, in, 1654, a, small, treatise, of, liberty, and, necessity, directed, at, hobbes, was, published, by, bishop, john, bramhall, bramhall, a, strong, arminian, had, met, and, debated, with, hobbes, and, afterwards, wrote, down, his, views, and, sent, them, privately, to, be, answered, in, this, form, by, hobbes, hobbes, duly, replied, but, not, for, publication, however, a, french, acquaintance, took, a, copy, of, the, reply, and, published, it, with, an, extravagantly, laudatory, epistle, bramhall, countered, in, 1655, when, he, printed, everything, that, had, passed, between, them, under, the, title, of, a, defence, of, the, true, liberty, of, human, actions, from, antecedent, or, extrinsic, necessity, in, 1656, hobbes, was, ready, with, the, questions, concerning, liberty, necessity, and, chance, in, which, he, replied, with, astonishing, force, to, the, bishop, as, perhaps, the, first, clear, exposition, of, the, psychological, doctrine, of, determinism, hobbes, s, own, two, pieces, were, important, in, the, history, of, the, free, will, controversy, the, bishop, returned, to, the, charge, in, 1658, with, castigations, of, mr, hobbes, s, animadversions, and, also, included, a, bulky, appendix, entitled, the, catching, of, leviathan, the, great, whale, hobbes, opposed, the, existing, academic, arrangements, and, assailed, the, system, of, the, original, universities, in, leviathan, he, went, on, to, publish, de, corpore, which, contained, not, only, tendentious, views, on, mathematics, but, also, an, erroneous, proof, of, the, squaring, of, the, circle, this, all, led, mathematicians, to, target, him, for, polemics, and, sparked, john, wallis, to, become, one, of, his, most, persistent, opponents, from, 1655, the, publishing, date, of, de, corpore, hobbes, and, wallis, continued, name, calling, and, bickering, for, nearly, a, quarter, of, a, century, with, hobbes, failing, to, admit, his, error, to, the, end, of, his, life, after, years, of, debate, the, spat, over, proving, the, squaring, of, the, circle, gained, such, notoriety, that, it, has, become, one, of, the, most, infamous, feuds, in, mathematical, history, the, religious, opinions, of, hobbes, remain, controversial, as, many, positions, have, been, attributed, to, him, and, range, from, atheism, to, orthodox, christianity, in, the, elements, of, law, hobbes, provided, a, cosmological, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, saying, that, god, is, the, first, cause, of, all, causes, hobbes, was, accused, of, atheism, by, several, contemporaries, bramhall, accused, him, of, teachings, that, could, lead, to, atheism, this, was, an, important, accusation, and, hobbes, himself, wrote, in, his, answer, to, bramhall, s, the, catching, of, leviathan, that, atheism, impiety, and, the, like, are, words, of, the, greatest, defamation, possible, hobbes, always, defended, himself, from, such, accusations, in, more, recent, times, also, much, has, been, made, of, his, religious, views, by, scholars, such, as, richard, tuck, and, j, g, a, pocock, but, there, is, still, widespread, disagreement, about, the, exact, significance, of, hobbes, s, unusual, views, on, religion, as, martinich, has, pointed, out, in, hobbes, s, time, the, term, atheist, was, often, applied, to, people, who, believed, in, god, but, not, in, divine, providence, or, to, people, who, believed, in, god, but, also, maintained, other, beliefs, that, were, considered, to, be, inconsistent, with, such, belief, or, judged, incompatible, with, orthodox, christianity, he, says, that, this, sort, of, discrepancy, has, led, to, many, errors, in, determining, who, was, an, atheist, in, the, early, modern, period, in, this, extended, early, modern, sense, of, atheism, hobbes, did, take, positions, that, strongly, disagreed, with, church, teachings, of, his, time, for, example, he, argued, repeatedly, that, there, are, no, incorporeal, substances, and, that, all, things, including, human, thoughts, and, even, god, heaven, and, hell, are, corporeal, matter, in, motion, he, argued, that, though, scripture, acknowledge, spirits, yet, doth, it, nowhere, say, that, they, are, incorporeal, meaning, thereby, without, dimensions, and, quantity, in, this, view, hobbes, claimed, to, be, following, tertullian, like, john, locke, he, also, stated, that, true, revelation, can, never, disagree, with, human, reason, and, experience, although, he, also, argued, that, people, should, accept, revelation, and, its, interpretations, for, the, reason, that, they, should, accept, the, commands, of, their, sovereign, in, order, to, avoid, war, while, in, venice, on, tour, hobbes, made, the, acquaintance, of, fulgenzio, micanzio, a, close, associate, of, paolo, sarpi, who, had, written, against, the, pretensions, of, the, papacy, to, temporal, power, in, response, to, the, interdict, of, pope, paul, v, against, venice, which, refused, to, recognise, papal, prerogatives, james, i, had, invited, both, men, to, england, in, 1612, micanzio, and, sarpi, had, argued, that, god, willed, human, nature, and, that, human, nature, indicated, the, autonomy, of, the, state, in, temporal, affairs, when, he, returned, to, england, in, 1615, william, cavendish, maintained, correspondence, with, micanzio, and, sarpi, and, hobbes, translated, the, latter, s, letters, from, italian, which, were, circulated, among, the, duke, s, circle, editions, compiled, by, william, molesworth, pp, 193,
