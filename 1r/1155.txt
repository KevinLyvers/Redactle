of, denmark, from, 1018, and, king, of, norway, from, 1028, until, his, death, in, 1035, the, three, kingdoms, united, under, cnut, s, rule, are, referred, to, together, as, the, north, sea, empire, by, historians, as, a, danish, prince, cnut, won, the, throne, of, england, in, 1016, in, the, wake, of, centuries, of, viking, activity, in, northwestern, europe, his, later, accession, to, the, danish, throne, in, 1018, brought, the, crowns, of, england, and, denmark, together, cnut, sought, to, keep, this, power, base, by, uniting, danes, and, english, under, cultural, bonds, of, wealth, and, custom, after, a, decade, of, conflict, with, opponents, in, scandinavia, cnut, claimed, the, crown, of, norway, in, trondheim, in, 1028, in, 1031, malcolm, ii, of, scotland, also, submitted, to, him, though, anglo, norse, influence, over, scotland, was, weak, and, ultimately, did, not, last, by, the, time, of, cnut, s, death, dominion, of, england, lent, the, danes, an, important, link, to, the, maritime, zone, between, the, islands, of, great, britain, and, ireland, where, cnut, like, his, father, before, him, had, a, strong, interest, and, wielded, much, influence, among, the, norse, gaels, cnut, s, possession, of, england, s, dioceses, and, the, continental, diocese, of, denmark, with, a, claim, laid, upon, it, by, the, holy, roman, empire, s, archdiocese, of, hamburg, bremen, was, a, source, of, great, prestige, and, leverage, within, the, catholic, church, and, among, the, magnates, of, christendom, gaining, notable, concessions, such, as, one, on, the, price, of, the, pallium, of, his, bishops, though, they, still, had, to, travel, to, obtain, the, pallium, as, well, as, on, the, tolls, his, people, had, to, pay, on, the, way, to, rome, after, his, 1026, victory, against, norway, and, sweden, and, on, his, way, back, from, rome, where, he, attended, the, coronation, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, cnut, deemed, himself, king, of, all, england, and, denmark, and, the, norwegians, and, of, some, of, the, swedes, in, a, letter, written, for, the, benefit, of, his, subjects, medieval, historian, norman, cantor, called, him, the, most, effective, king, in, anglo, saxon, history, he, is, popularly, invoked, in, the, context, of, the, legend, of, king, canute, and, the, tide, cnut, was, a, son, of, the, danish, prince, sweyn, forkbeard, who, was, the, son, and, heir, to, king, harald, bluetooth, and, thus, came, from, a, line, of, scandinavian, rulers, central, to, the, unification, of, denmark, neither, the, place, nor, the, date, of, his, birth, are, known, harthacnut, i, was, the, semi, legendary, founder, of, the, danish, royal, house, at, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, and, his, son, gorm, the, old, became, the, first, in, the, official, line, the, old, in, his, name, indicates, this, harald, bluetooth, gorm, s, son, and, cnut, s, grandfather, was, the, danish, king, at, the, time, of, the, christianization, of, denmark, he, became, one, of, the, first, scandinavian, kings, to, accept, christianity, the, chronicon, of, thietmar, of, merseburg, and, the, encomium, emmae, report, cnut, s, mother, as, having, been, wi, tos, awa, a, daughter, of, mieszko, i, of, poland, norse, sources, of, the, high, middle, ages, most, prominently, heimskringla, by, snorri, sturluson, also, give, a, polish, princess, as, cnut, s, mother, whom, they, call, gunhild, a, daughter, of, burislav, the, king, of, vindland, since, in, the, norse, sagas, the, king, of, vindland, is, always, burislav, this, is, reconcilable, with, the, assumption, that, her, father, was, mieszko, not, his, son, boles, aw, adam, of, bremen, in, gesta, hammaburgensis, ecclesiae, pontificum, is, unique, in, equating, cnut, s, mother, for, whom, he, also, produces, no, name, with, the, former, queen, of, sweden, wife, of, eric, the, victorious, and, by, this, marriage, mother, of, olof, sk, tkonung, to, complicate, the, matter, heimskringla, and, other, sagas, also, have, sweyn, marrying, eric, s, widow, but, she, is, distinctly, another, person, in, these, texts, named, sigrid, the, haughty, whom, sweyn, only, marries, after, gunhild, the, slavic, princess, who, bore, cnut, has, died, different, theories, regarding, the, number, and, ancestry, of, sweyn, s, wives, or, wife, have, been, advanced, see, sigrid, the, haughty, and, gunhild, but, since, adam, is, the, only, source, to, equate, the, identity, of, cnut, s, and, olof, sk, tkonung, s, mother, this, is, often, seen, as, an, error, on, adam, s, part, and, it, is, often, assumed, that, sweyn, had, two, wives, the, first, being, cnut, s, mother, and, the, second, being, the, former, queen, of, sweden, cnut, s, brother, harald, was, the, younger, of, the, two, brothers, according, to, encomium, emmae, some, hint, of, cnut, s, childhood, can, be, found, in, the, flateyjarb, k, a, 13th, century, icelandic, source, that, says, he, was, taught, his, soldiery, by, the, chieftain, thorkell, the, tall, brother, to, sigurd, jarl, of, jomsborg, and, the, legendary, jomsvikings, at, their, stronghold, on, the, island, of, wollin, off, the, coast, of, pomerania, his, date, of, birth, like, his, mother, s, name, is, unknown, contemporary, works, such, as, the, chronicon, and, the, encomium, emmae, do, not, mention, this, even, so, in, a, kn, tsdr, pa, by, the, skald, ttarr, svarti, there, is, a, statement, that, cnut, was, of, no, great, age, when, he, first, went, to, war, it, also, mentions, a, battle, identifiable, with, sweyn, forkbeard, s, invasion, of, england, and, attack, on, the, city, of, norwich, in, 1003, 04, after, the, st, brice, s, day, massacre, of, danes, by, the, english, in, 1002, if, cnut, indeed, accompanied, this, expedition, his, birthdate, may, be, near, 990, or, even, 980, if, not, and, if, the, skald, s, poetic, verse, references, another, assault, such, as, sweyn, s, conquest, of, england, in, 1013, 14, it, may, even, suggest, a, birth, date, nearer, 1000, there, is, a, passage, of, the, encomiast, as, the, author, of, the, encomium, emmae, is, known, with, a, reference, to, the, force, cnut, led, in, his, english, conquest, of, 1015, 16, here, see, below, it, says, all, the, vikings, were, of, mature, age, under, cnut, the, king, a, description, of, cnut, appears, in, the, 13th, century, icelandic, kn, tlinga, saga, knut, was, exceptionally, tall, and, strong, and, the, handsomest, of, men, all, except, for, his, nose, that, was, thin, high, set, and, rather, hooked, he, had, a, fair, complexion, and, a, fine, thick, head, of, hair, his, eyes, were, better, than, those, of, other, men, being, both, more, handsome, and, keener, sighted, hardly, anything, is, known, for, sure, of, cnut, s, life, until, the, year, he, was, part, of, a, scandinavian, force, under, his, father, king, sweyn, in, his, invasion, of, england, in, summer, 1013, cnut, was, likely, part, of, his, father, s, 1003, and, 1004, campaigns, in, england, although, the, evidence, is, not, firm, the, 1013, invasion, was, the, climax, to, a, succession, of, viking, raids, spread, over, a, number, of, decades, following, their, landing, in, the, humber, the, kingdom, fell, to, the, vikings, quickly, and, near, the, end, of, the, year, king, thelred, fled, to, normandy, leaving, sweyn, forkbeard, in, possession, of, england, in, the, winter, sweyn, was, in, the, process, of, consolidating, his, kingship, with, cnut, left, in, charge, of, the, fleet, and, the, base, of, the, army, at, gainsborough, in, lincolnshire, on, the, death, of, sweyn, forkbeard, after, a, few, months, as, king, on, candlemas, sunday, 3, february, 1014, harald, succeeded, him, as, king, of, denmark, while, the, vikings, and, the, people, of, the, danelaw, immediately, elected, cnut, as, king, in, england, however, the, english, nobility, took, a, different, view, and, the, witenagemot, recalled, thelred, from, normandy, the, restored, king, swiftly, led, an, army, against, cnut, who, fled, with, his, army, to, denmark, along, the, way, mutilating, the, hostages, they, had, taken, and, abandoning, them, on, the, beach, at, sandwich, in, kent, cnut, went, to, harald, and, supposedly, made, the, suggestion, they, might, have, a, joint, kingship, although, this, found, no, favour, with, his, brother, harald, is, thought, to, have, offered, cnut, command, of, his, forces, for, another, invasion, of, england, on, the, condition, he, did, not, continue, to, press, his, claim, in, any, case, cnut, succeeded, in, assembling, a, large, fleet, with, which, to, launch, another, invasion, among, the, allies, of, denmark, was, boles, aw, i, the, brave, the, duke, of, poland, later, crowned, king, and, a, relative, to, the, danish, royal, house, he, lent, some, polish, troops, likely, to, have, been, a, pledge, made, to, cnut, and, his, brother, harald, when, in, the, winter, they, went, amongst, the, wends, to, fetch, their, mother, back, to, the, danish, court, she, had, been, sent, away, by, their, father, after, the, death, of, the, swedish, king, eric, the, victorious, in, 995, and, his, marriage, to, sigrid, the, haughty, the, swedish, queen, mother, this, wedlock, formed, a, strong, alliance, between, the, successor, to, the, throne, of, sweden, olof, sk, tkonung, and, the, rulers, of, denmark, his, in,

norway, with, his, brother, sweyn, haakonsson, norway, having, been, under, danish, sovereignty, since, the, battle, of, svolder, in, 999, eir, kr, s, participation, in, the, invasion, left, his, son, hakon, to, rule, norway, with, sweyn, in, the, summer, of, 1015, cnut, s, fleet, set, sail, for, england, with, a, danish, army, of, perhaps, 10, 000, in, 200, longships, cnut, was, at, the, head, of, an, array, of, vikings, from, all, over, scandinavia, the, invading, army, was, composed, primarily, of, mercenaries, the, invasion, force, was, to, engage, in, often, close, and, grisly, warfare, with, the, english, for, the, next, fourteen, months, practically, all, of, the, battles, were, fought, against, the, eldest, son, of, thelred, edmund, ironside, according, to, the, peterborough, chronicle, manuscript, one, of, the, major, witnesses, of, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, early, in, september, 1015, came, into, sandwich, and, straightway, sailed, around, kent, to, wessex, until, he, came, to, the, mouth, of, the, frome, and, harried, in, dorset, and, wiltshire, and, somerset, beginning, a, campaign, of, an, intensity, not, seen, since, the, days, of, alfred, the, great, a, passage, from, queen, emma, s, encomium, provides, a, picture, of, cnut, s, fleet, here, were, there, so, many, kinds, of, shields, that, you, could, have, believed, that, troops, of, all, nations, were, present, gold, shone, on, the, prows, silver, also, flashed, on, the, variously, shaped, ships, for, who, could, look, upon, the, lions, of, the, foe, terrible, with, the, brightness, of, gold, who, upon, the, men, of, metal, menacing, with, golden, face, who, upon, the, bulls, on, the, ships, threatening, death, their, horns, shining, with, gold, without, feeling, any, fear, for, the, king, of, such, a, force, furthermore, in, this, great, expedition, there, was, present, no, slave, no, man, freed, from, slavery, no, low, born, man, no, man, weakened, by, age, for, all, were, noble, all, strong, with, the, might, of, mature, age, all, sufficiently, fit, for, any, type, of, fighting, all, of, such, great, fleetness, that, they, scorned, the, speed, of, horsemen, wessex, long, ruled, by, the, dynasty, of, alfred, and, thelred, submitted, to, cnut, late, in, 1015, as, it, had, to, his, father, two, years, earlier, at, this, point, eadric, streona, the, ealdorman, of, mercia, deserted, thelred, together, with, 40, ships, and, their, crews, and, joined, forces, with, cnut, another, defector, was, thorkell, the, tall, a, jomsviking, chief, who, had, fought, against, the, viking, invasion, of, sweyn, forkbeard, with, a, pledge, of, allegiance, to, the, english, in, 1012, some, explanation, for, this, shift, of, allegiance, may, be, found, in, a, stanza, of, the, j, msv, kinga, saga, that, mentions, two, attacks, against, jomsborg, s, mercenaries, while, they, were, in, england, with, a, man, known, as, henninge, a, brother, of, thorkell, among, their, casualties, if, the, flateyjarb, k, is, correct, that, this, man, was, cnut, s, childhood, mentor, it, explains, his, acceptance, of, his, allegiance, with, jomvikings, ultimately, in, the, service, of, jomsborg, the, 40, ships, eadric, came, with, often, thought, to, be, of, the, danelaw, were, probably, thorkell, s, early, in, 1016, the, vikings, crossed, the, thames, and, harried, warwickshire, while, edmund, ironside, s, attempts, at, opposition, seem, to, have, come, to, nothing, the, chronicler, says, the, english, army, disbanded, because, the, king, and, the, citizenry, of, london, were, not, present, the, mid, winter, assault, by, cnut, devastated, its, way, northwards, across, eastern, mercia, another, summons, of, the, army, brought, the, englishmen, together, and, they, were, met, this, time, by, the, king, although, it, came, to, nothing, as, so, often, before, and, thelred, returned, to, london, with, fears, of, betrayal, edmund, then, went, north, to, join, uhtred, the, earl, of, northumbria, and, together, they, harried, staffordshire, shropshire, and, cheshire, in, western, mercia, possibly, targeting, the, estates, of, eadric, streona, cnut, s, occupation, of, northumbria, meant, uhtred, returned, home, to, submit, himself, to, cnut, who, seems, to, have, sent, a, northumbrian, rival, thurbrand, the, hold, to, massacre, uhtred, and, his, retinue, eir, kr, h, konarson, most, likely, with, another, force, of, scandinavians, came, to, support, cnut, at, this, point, and, the, veteran, norwegian, jarl, was, put, in, charge, of, northumbria, prince, edmund, remained, in, london, still, unsubdued, behind, its, walls, and, was, elected, king, after, the, death, of, thelred, on, 23, april, 1016, cnut, returned, southward, and, the, danish, army, evidently, divided, some, dealing, with, edmund, who, had, broken, out, of, london, before, cnut, s, encirclement, of, the, city, was, complete, and, had, gone, to, gather, an, army, in, wessex, the, traditional, heartland, of, the, english, monarchy, part, of, the, danish, army, besieged, london, constructing, dikes, on, the, northern, and, southern, flanks, and, a, channel, dug, across, the, banks, of, the, thames, to, the, south, of, the, city, enabling, their, longships, to, cut, off, communications, up, river, there, was, a, battle, fought, at, penselwood, in, somerset, with, a, hill, in, selwood, forest, as, the, likely, location, and, a, subsequent, battle, at, sherston, in, wiltshire, which, was, fought, over, two, days, but, left, neither, side, victorious, edmund, was, able, to, temporarily, relieve, london, driving, the, enemy, away, and, defeating, them, after, crossing, the, thames, at, brentford, suffering, heavy, losses, he, withdrew, to, wessex, to, gather, fresh, troops, and, the, danes, again, brought, london, under, siege, but, after, another, unsuccessful, assault, they, withdrew, into, kent, under, attack, by, the, english, with, a, battle, fought, at, otford, at, this, point, eadric, streona, went, over, to, king, edmund, and, cnut, set, sail, northwards, across, the, thames, estuary, to, essex, and, went, from, the, landing, of, the, ships, up, the, river, orwell, to, ravage, mercia, on, 18, october, 1016, the, danes, were, engaged, by, edmund, s, army, as, they, retired, towards, their, ships, leading, to, the, battle, of, assandun, fought, at, either, ashingdon, in, south, east, or, ashdon, in, north, west, essex, in, the, ensuing, struggle, eadric, streona, whose, return, to, the, english, side, had, perhaps, only, been, a, ruse, withdrew, his, forces, from, the, fray, bringing, about, a, decisive, english, defeat, edmund, fled, westwards, and, cnut, pursued, him, into, gloucestershire, with, another, battle, probably, fought, near, the, forest, of, dean, for, edmund, had, an, alliance, with, some, of, the, welsh, on, an, island, near, deerhurst, cnut, and, edmund, who, had, been, wounded, met, to, negotiate, terms, of, peace, it, was, agreed, that, all, of, england, north, of, the, thames, was, to, be, the, domain, of, the, danish, prince, while, all, to, the, south, was, kept, by, the, english, king, along, with, london, accession, to, the, reign, of, the, entire, realm, was, set, to, pass, to, cnut, upon, edmund, s, death, edmund, died, on, 30, november, within, weeks, of, the, arrangement, some, sources, claim, edmund, was, murdered, although, the, circumstances, of, his, death, are, unknown, the, west, saxons, now, accepted, cnut, as, king, of, all, of, england, and, he, was, crowned, by, lyfing, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, london, in, 1017, cnut, ruled, england, for, nearly, two, decades, the, protection, he, lent, against, viking, raiders, many, of, them, under, his, command, restored, the, prosperity, that, had, been, increasingly, impaired, since, the, resumption, of, viking, attacks, in, the, 980s, in, turn, the, english, helped, him, to, establish, control, over, the, majority, of, scandinavia, too, under, his, rule, england, did, not, experience, serious, external, attacks, as, danish, king, of, england, cnut, was, quick, to, eliminate, any, prospective, challenge, from, the, survivors, of, the, mighty, wessex, dynasty, the, first, year, of, his, reign, was, marked, by, the, executions, of, a, number, of, english, noblemen, whom, he, considered, suspect, thelred, s, son, eadwig, theling, fled, from, england, but, was, killed, on, cnut, s, orders, edmund, ironside, s, sons, likewise, fled, abroad, thelred, s, sons, by, emma, of, normandy, went, under, the, protection, of, their, relatives, in, the, duchy, of, normandy, in, july, 1017, cnut, wed, queen, emma, the, widow, of, thelred, and, daughter, of, richard, i, duke, of, normandy, in, 1018, having, collected, a, danegeld, amounting, to, the, colossal, sum, of, 72, 000, levied, nationwide, with, an, additional, 10, 500, extracted, from, london, cnut, paid, off, his, army, and, sent, most, of, them, home, he, retained, 40, ships, and, their, crews, as, a, standing, force, in, england, an, annual, tax, called, heregeld, army, payment, was, collected, through, the, same, system, thelred, had, instituted, in, 1012, to, reward, scandinavians, in, his, service, cnut, built, on, the, existing, english, trend, for, multiple, shires, to, be, grouped, together, under, a, single, ealdorman, thus, dividing, the, country, into, four, large, administrative, units, whose, geographical, extent, was, based, on, the, largest, and, most, durable, of, the, separate, kingdoms, that, had, preceded, the, unification, of, england, the, officials, responsible, for, these, provinces, were, designated, earls, a, title, of, scandinavian, origin, already, in, localised, use, in, england, which, now, everywhere, replaced, that, of, ealdorman, wessex, was, initially, kept, under, cnut, s, personal, control, while, northumbria, went, to, erik, of, hlathir, east, anglia, to, thorkell, the, tall, and, mercia, remained, in, the, hands, of, eadric, streona, this, initial, distribution, of, power, was, short, lived, the, chronically, treacherous, eadric, was, executed, within, a, year, of, cnut, s, accession, mercia, passed, to, one, of, the, leading, families, of, the, region, probably, first, to, leofwine, ealdorman, of, the, hwicce, under, thelred, but, certainly, soon, to, his, son, leofric, in, 1021, thorkel, also, fell, from, favour, and, was, outlawed, following, his, death, in, the, 1020s, erik, of, hlathir, was, succeeded, as, earl, of, northumbria, by, siward, whose, grandmother, estrid, married, to, lfr, thorgilsson, was, cnut, s, sister, bernicia, the, northern, part, of, northumbria, was, theoretically, part, of, erik, and, siward, s, earldom, but, throughout, cnut, s, reign, it, effectively, remained, under, the, control, of, the, english, dynasty, based, at, bamburgh, which, had, dominated, the, area, at, least, since, the, early, 10th, century, they, served, as, junior, earls, of, bernicia, under, the, titular, authority, of, the, earl, of, northumbria, by, the, 1030s, cnut, s, direct, administration, of, wessex, had, come, to, an, end, with, the, establishment, of, an, earldom, under, godwin, an, englishman, from, a, powerful, sussex, family, in, general, after, initial, reliance, on, his, scandinavian, followers, in, the, first, years, of, his, reign, cnut, allowed, those, anglo, saxon, families, of, the, existing, english, nobility, who, had, earned, his, trust, to, assume, rulership, of, his, earldoms, at, the, battle, of, nesjar, in, 1016, olaf, haraldsson, won, the, kingdom, of, norway, from, the, danes, it, was, at, some, time, after, erik, left, for, england, and, on, the, death, of, svein, while, retreating, to, sweden, maybe, intent, on, returning, to, norway, with, reinforcements, that, erik, s, son, hakon, went, to, join, his, father, and, support, cnut, in, england, too, cnut, s, brother, harald, may, have, been, at, cnut, s, coronation, in, 1016, returning, to, denmark, as, its, king, with, part, of, the, fleet, at, some, point, thereafter, it, is, only, certain, though, that, there, was, an, entry, of, his, name, alongside, cnut, s, in, confraternity, with, christ, church, canterbury, in, 1018, this, is, not, conclusive, though, for, the, entry, may, have, been, made, in, harald, s, absence, perhaps, by, the, hand, of, cnut, himself, which, means, that, while, it, is, usually, thought, that, harald, died, in, 1018, it, is, unsure, whether, he, was, still, alive, at, this, point, entry, of, his, brother, s, name, in, the, canterbury, codex, may, have, been, cnut, s, attempt, to, make, his, vengeance, for, harald, s, murder, good, with, the, church, this, may, have, been, just, a, gesture, for, a, soul, to, be, under, the, protection, of, god, there, is, evidence, cnut, was, in, battle, with, pirates, in, 1018, with, his, destruction, of, the, crews, of, thirty, ships, although, it, is, unknown, if, this, was, off, the, english, or, danish, shores, he, himself, mentions, troubles, in, his, 1019, letter, to, england, from, denmark, written, as, the, king, of, england, and, denmark, these, events, can, be, seen, with, plausibility, to, be, in, connection, with, the, death, of, harald, cnut, says, he, dealt, with, dissenters, to,

and, deliverance, if, we, need, it, cnut, was, generally, remembered, as, a, wise, and, successful, king, of, england, although, this, view, may, in, part, be, attributable, to, his, good, treatment, of, the, church, keeper, of, the, historic, record, accordingly, he, is, considered, even, today, as, a, religious, man, despite, the, fact, that, he, was, in, an, arguably, sinful, relationship, with, two, wives, and, the, harsh, treatment, he, dealt, his, fellow, christian, opponents, under, his, reign, cnut, brought, together, the, english, and, danish, kingdoms, and, the, scandinavic, and, saxon, peoples, saw, a, period, of, dominance, across, scandinavia, as, well, as, within, the, british, isles, his, campaigns, abroad, meant, the, tables, of, viking, supremacy, were, stacked, in, favour, of, the, english, turning, the, prows, of, the, longships, towards, scandinavia, he, reinstated, the, laws, of, king, edgar, to, allow, for, the, constitution, of, a, danelaw, and, for, the, activity, of, scandinavians, at, large, cnut, reinstituted, the, extant, laws, with, a, series, of, proclamations, to, assuage, common, grievances, brought, to, his, attention, including, on, inheritance, in, case, of, intestacy, and, on, heriots, and, reliefs, he, also, strengthened, the, currency, initiating, a, series, of, coins, of, equal, weight, to, those, being, used, in, denmark, and, other, parts, of, scandinavia, he, issued, the, law, codes, of, cnut, known, now, as, i, cnut, and, ii, cnut, though, these, seem, primarily, to, have, been, produced, by, wulfstan, of, york, in, his, royal, court, there, were, both, englishmen, and, scandinavians, harald, ii, died, in, 1018, and, cnut, went, to, denmark, to, affirm, his, succession, to, the, danish, crown, stating, his, intention, to, avert, attacks, against, england, in, a, letter, in, 1019, see, above, it, seems, there, were, danes, in, opposition, to, him, and, an, attack, he, carried, out, on, the, wends, of, pomerania, may, have, had, something, to, do, with, this, in, this, expedition, at, least, one, of, cnut, s, englishmen, godwin, apparently, won, the, king, s, trust, after, a, night, time, raid, he, personally, led, against, a, wendish, encampment, his, hold, on, the, danish, throne, presumably, stable, cnut, was, back, in, england, in, 1020, he, appointed, ulf, jarl, the, husband, of, his, sister, estrid, svendsdatter, as, regent, of, denmark, further, entrusting, him, with, his, young, son, by, queen, emma, harthacnut, whom, he, had, designated, the, heir, of, his, kingdom, the, banishment, of, thorkell, the, tall, in, 1021, may, be, seen, in, relation, to, the, attack, on, the, wends, with, the, death, of, olof, sk, tkonung, in, 1022, and, the, succession, to, the, swedish, throne, of, his, son, anund, jacob, bringing, sweden, into, alliance, with, norway, there, was, cause, for, a, demonstration, of, danish, strength, in, the, baltic, jomsborg, the, legendary, stronghold, of, the, jomsvikings, thought, to, be, on, an, island, off, the, coast, of, pomerania, was, probably, the, target, of, cnut, s, expedition, successful, after, this, clear, display, of, cnut, s, intentions, to, dominate, scandinavian, affairs, it, seems, that, thorkell, reconciled, with, cnut, in, 1023, when, the, norwegian, king, olaf, haraldsson, and, anund, jakob, took, advantage, of, cnut, s, commitment, to, england, and, began, to, launch, attacks, against, denmark, ulf, gave, the, danish, freemen, cause, to, accept, harthacnut, still, a, child, as, king, this, ruse, resulted, in, ulf, ruling, the, kingdom, as, regent, upon, news, of, these, events, cnut, set, sail, for, denmark, to, restore, himself, and, to, deal, with, ulf, who, then, got, back, in, line, in, a, battle, known, as, the, battle, of, the, helge, cnut, and, his, men, fought, the, norwegians, and, swedes, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, helge, probably, in, 1026, and, the, apparent, victory, left, cnut, as, the, dominant, leader, in, scandinavia, ulf, the, usurper, s, realignment, and, participation, in, the, battle, did, not, in, the, end, earn, him, cnut, s, forgiveness, some, sources, state, that, the, brothers, in, law, were, playing, chess, at, a, banquet, in, roskilde, when, an, argument, arose, between, them, and, the, next, day, christmas, 1026, one, of, cnut, s, housecarls, killed, the, jarl, with, his, blessing, in, trinity, church, the, predecessor, to, roskilde, cathedral, his, enemies, in, scandinavia, subdued, and, apparently, at, his, leisure, cnut, was, able, to, accept, an, invitation, to, witness, the, accession, in, rome, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, conrad, ii, he, left, his, affairs, in, the, north, and, went, from, denmark, to, the, coronation, at, easter, 1027, which, would, have, been, of, considerable, prestige, for, rulers, of, europe, in, the, middle, ages, on, the, return, journey, he, wrote, his, letter, of, 1027, like, his, letter, of, 1019, informing, his, subjects, in, england, of, his, intentions, from, abroad, and, proclaiming, himself, king, of, all, england, and, denmark, and, the, norwegians, and, of, some, of, the, swedes, consistent, with, his, role, as, a, christian, king, cnut, says, he, went, to, rome, to, repent, for, his, sins, to, pray, for, redemption, and, the, security, of, his, subjects, and, to, negotiate, with, the, pope, for, a, reduction, in, the, costs, of, the, pallium, for, english, archbishops, and, for, a, resolution, to, the, competition, between, the, archdioceses, of, canterbury, and, hamburg, bremen, for, superiority, over, the, danish, dioceses, he, also, sought, to, improve, the, conditions, for, pilgrims, as, well, as, merchants, on, the, road, to, rome, in, his, own, words, i, spoke, with, the, emperor, himself, and, the, lord, pope, and, the, princes, there, about, the, needs, of, all, people, of, my, entire, realm, both, english, and, danes, that, a, juster, law, and, securer, peace, might, be, granted, to, them, on, the, road, to, rome, and, that, they, should, not, be, straitened, by, so, many, barriers, along, the, road, and, harassed, by, unjust, tolls, and, the, emperor, agreed, and, likewise, king, robert, who, governs, most, of, these, same, toll, gates, and, all, the, magnates, confirmed, by, edict, that, my, people, both, merchants, and, the, others, who, travel, to, make, their, devotions, might, go, to, rome, and, return, without, being, afflicted, by, barriers, and, toll, collectors, in, firm, peace, and, secure, in, a, just, law, robert, in, cnut, s, text, is, probably, a, clerical, error, for, rudolph, the, last, ruler, of, an, independent, kingdom, of, burgundy, hence, the, solemn, word, of, the, pope, the, emperor, and, rudolph, was, given, with, the, witness, of, four, archbishops, twenty, bishops, and, innumerable, multitudes, of, dukes, and, nobles, suggesting, it, was, before, the, ceremonies, were, completed, cnut, without, doubt, threw, himself, into, his, role, with, zest, his, image, as, a, just, christian, king, statesman, and, diplomat, and, crusader, against, unjustness, seems, rooted, in, reality, as, well, as, one, he, sought, to, project, a, good, illustration, of, his, status, within, europe, is, the, fact, that, cnut, and, the, king, of, burgundy, went, alongside, the, emperor, in, the, imperial, procession, and, stood, shoulder, to, shoulder, with, him, on, the, same, pedestal, cnut, and, the, emperor, in, accord, with, various, sources, took, to, one, another, s, company, like, brothers, for, they, were, of, a, similar, age, conrad, gave, cnut, lands, in, the, mark, of, schleswig, the, land, bridge, between, the, scandinavian, kingdoms, and, the, continent, as, a, token, of, their, treaty, of, friendship, centuries, of, conflict, in, this, area, between, the, danes, and, the, germans, led, to, the, construction, of, the, danevirke, from, schleswig, on, the, schlei, an, inlet, of, the, baltic, sea, to, the, north, sea, cnut, s, visit, to, rome, was, a, triumph, in, the, verse, of, kn, tsdr, pa, sigvatr, r, arson, praises, cnut, his, king, as, being, dear, to, the, emperor, close, to, peter, in, the, days, of, christendom, a, king, seen, to, be, in, favour, with, god, could, expect, to, be, ruler, over, a, happy, kingdom, he, was, surely, in, a, stronger, position, not, only, with, the, church, and, the, people, but, also, in, the, alliance, with, his, southern, rivals, he, was, able, to, conclude, his, conflicts, with, his, rivals, in, the, north, his, letter, not, only, tells, his, countrymen, of, his, achievements, in, rome, but, also, of, his, ambitions, within, the, scandinavian, world, at, his, arrival, home, i, as, i, wish, to, be, made, known, to, you, returning, by, the, same, route, that, i, took, out, am, going, to, denmark, to, arrange, peace, and, a, firm, treaty, in, the, counsel, of, all, the, danes, with, those, races, and, people, who, would, have, deprived, us, of, life, and, rule, if, they, could, but, they, could, not, god, destroying, their, strength, may, he, preserve, us, by, his, bounteous, compassion, in, rule, and, honour, and, henceforth, scatter, and, bring, to, nothing, the, power, and, might, of, all, our, enemies, and, finally, when, peace, has, been, arranged, with, our, surrounding, peoples, and, all, our, kingdom, here, in, the, east, has, been, properly, ordered, and, pacified, so, that, we, have, no, war, to, fear, on, any, side, or, the, hostility, of, individuals, i, intend, to, come, to, england, as, early, this, summer, as, i, can, to, attend, to, the, equipping, of, a, fleet, cnut, was, to, return, to, denmark, from, rome, arrange, for, its, security, and, afterward, sail, to, england, in, his, 1027, letter, cnut, refers, to, himself, as, king, of, the, norwegians, and, of, some, of, the, swedes, his, victory, over, swedes, suggests, helge, to, be, the, river, in, uppland, and, not, the, one, in, eastern, scania, while, the, king, of, sweden, appears, to, have, been, made, a, renegade, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, swedish, city, sigtuna, was, held, by, cnut, there, were, coins, struck, there, that, called, him, king, but, there, is, no, narrative, record, of, his, occupation, these, coins, are, however, usually, regarded, as, copies, of, coins, minted, in, denmark, coins, stating, that, the, swedish, king, olof, sk, tkonung, was, king, of, england, have, also, been, found, in, sigtuna, cnut, also, stated, his, intention, of, proceeding, to, denmark, to, secure, peace, between, the, kingdoms, of, scandinavia, which, fits, the, account, of, john, of, worcester, that, in, 1027, cnut, heard, some, norwegians, were, discontented, and, sent, them, sums, of, gold, and, silver, to, gain, their, support, for, his, claim, to, the, throne, in, 1028, cnut, set, off, from, england, to, norway, and, the, city, of, trondheim, with, a, fleet, of, fifty, ships, king, olaf, haraldsson, was, unable, to, put, up, a, serious, fight, both, as, his, nobles, had, been, bribed, by, cnut, and, according, to, adam, of, bremen, because, he, tended, to, apprehend, their, wives, for, sorcery, cnut, was, crowned, king, now, of, england, denmark, and, norway, as, well, as, part, of, sweden, he, entrusted, the, earldom, of, lade, to, the, former, line, of, earls, in, h, kon, eiriksson, with, eir, kr, h, konarson, probably, dead, by, this, time, hakon, was, possibly, the, earl, of, northumbria, after, erik, as, well, hakon, a, member, of, a, family, with, a, long, tradition, of, hostility, towards, the, independent, norwegian, kings, and, a, relative, of, cnut, s, was, already, in, lordship, over, the, isles, with, the, earldom, of, worcester, possibly, from, 1016, to, 1017, the, sea, lanes, through, the, irish, sea, and, the, hebrides, led, to, orkney, and, norway, and, were, central, to, cnut, s, ambitions, for, dominance, of, scandinavia, and, the, british, isles, hakon, was, meant, to, be, cnut, s, lieutenant, in, this, strategic, chain, and, the, final, component, was, his, installation, as, the, king, s, deputy, in, norway, after, the, expulsion, of, olaf, haraldsson, in, 1028, unfortunately, he, was, drowned, in, a, shipwreck, in, the, pentland, firth, between, the, orkney, islands, and, the, mainland, coast, either, late, 1029, or, early, 1030, upon, the, death, of, hakon, olaf, haraldsson, returned, to, norway, with, swedes, in, his, army, he, died, at, the, hands, of, his, own, people, at, the, battle, of, stiklestad, in, 1030, cnut, s, subsequent, attempt, to, rule, norway, without, the, key, support, of, the, trondejarls, through, lfgifu, of, northampton, and, his, eldest, son, by, her, sweyn, knutsson, was, not, a, success, the, period, is, known, as, aelfgifu, s, time, in, norway, with, heavy, taxation, a, rebellion, and, the, restoration, of, the, former, norwegian, dynasty, under, saint, olaf, s, illegitimate, son, magnus, the, good, in, 1014, while, cnut, was, preparing, his, re, invasion, of, england, the, battle, of, clontarf, pitted, an, array, of, armies, laid, out, on, the, fields, before, the, walls, of, dublin, m, el, m, rda, mac, murchada, king, of, leinster, and, sigtrygg, silkbeard, ruler, of, the, norse, gaelic, kingdom, of, dublin, had, sent, out, emissaries, to, all, the, viking, kingdoms, to, request, assistance, in, their, rebellion, against, brian, b, ruma, the, high, king, of, ireland, sigurd, the, stout, the, earl, of, orkney, was, offered, command, of, all, the, norse, forces, while, the, high, king, had, sought, assistance, from, the, albannaich, who, were, led, by, domnall, mac, eim, n, meic, cainnig, the, mormaer, of, mar, the, leinster, norse, alliance, was, defeated, and, both, commanders, sigurd, and, m, el, m, rda, were, killed, brian, his, son, his, grandson, and, the, mormaer, domhnall, were, slain, as, well, sigtrygg, s, alliance, was, broken, although, he, was, left, alive, and, the, high, kingship, of, ireland, went, back, to, the, u, n, ill, again, under, m, el, sechnaill, mac, domnaill, there, was, a, brief, period, of, freedom, in, the, irish, sea, zone, for, the, vikings, of, dublin, with, a, political, vacuum, felt, throughout, the, entire, western, maritime, zone, of, the, north, atlantic, archipelago, prominent, among, those, who, stood, to, fill, the, void, was, cnut, whose, leadership, of, the, scandinavian, world, gave, him, a, unique, influence, over, the, western, colonies, and, whose, control, of, their, commercial, arteries, gave, an, economic, edge, to, political, domination, coinage, struck, by, the, king, in, dublin, silkbeard, bearing, cnut, s, quatrefoil, type, in, issue, c, 1017, 25, sporadically, replacing, the, legend, with, one, bearing, his, own, name, and, styling, him, as, ruler, either, of, dublin, or, among, the, irish, provides, evidence, of, cnut, s, influence, further, evidence, is, the, entry, of, one, sihtric, dux, in, three, of, cnut, s, charters, in, one, of, his, verses, cnut, s, court, poet, sigvatr, r, arson, recounts, that, famous, princes, brought, their, heads, to, cnut, and, bought, peace, this, verse, mentions, olaf, haraldsson, in, the, past, tense, his, death, at, the, battle, of, stiklestad, having, occurred, in, 1030, it, was, therefore, at, some, point, after, this, and, the, consolidation, of, norway, that, cnut, went, to, scotland, with, an, army, and, the, navy, in, the, irish, sea, in, 1031, to, receive, without, bloodshed, the, submission, of, three, scottish, kings, maelcolm, the, future, king, maelbeth, and, iehmarc, one, of, these, kings, iehmarc, may, be, one, echmarcach, mac, ragnaill, an, u, mair, chieftain, and, the, ruler, of, a, sea, kingdom, of, the, irish, sea, with, galloway, among, his, domains, nevertheless, it, appears, that, malcolm, adhered, to, little, of, cnut, s, power, and, that, influence, over, scotland, died, out, by, the, time, of, cnut, s, death, further, a, lausav, sa, attributable, to, the, skald, ttarr, svarti, greets, the, ruler, of, the, danes, irish, english, and, island, dwellers, use, of, irish, here, being, likely, to, mean, the, gall, ghaedil, kingdoms, rather, than, the, gaelic, kingdoms, it, brings, to, mind, sweyn, forkbeard, s, putative, activities, in, the, irish, sea, and, adam, of, bremen, s, story, of, his, stay, with, a, rex, scothorum, king, of, the, irish, can, also, be, linked, to, iehmarc, who, submitted, in, 1031, could, be, relevant, to, cnut, s, relations, with, the, irish, cnut, s, actions, as, a, conqueror, and, his, ruthless, treatment, of, the, overthrown, dynasty, had, made, him, uneasy, with, the, church, he, was, already, a, christian, before, he, was, king, being, named, lambert, at, his, baptism, although, the, christianization, of, scandinavia, was, not, at, all, complete, his, marriage, to, emma, of, normandy, even, though, he, was, already, married, to, lfgifu, of, northampton, who, was, kept, in, the, south, with, an, estate, in, exeter, was, another, conflict, with, church, teaching, in, an, effort, to, reconcile, himself, with, his, churchmen, cnut, repaired, all, the, english, churches, and, monasteries, that, were, victims, of, viking, plunder, and, refilled, their, coffers, he, also, built, new, churches, and, was, an, earnest, patron, of, monastic, communities, his, homeland, of, denmark, was, a, christian, nation, on, the, rise, and, the, desire, to, enhance, the, religion, was, still, fresh, as, an, example, the, first, stone, church, recorded, to, have, been, built, in, scandinavia, was, in, roskilde, c, 1027, and, its, patron, was, cnut, s, sister, estrid, it, is, difficult, to, ascertain, whether, cnut, s, attitude, towards, the, church, derived, from, deep, religious, devotion, or, was, merely, a, means, to, reinforce, his, regime, s, hold, on, the, people, there, is, evidence, of, respect, for, the, pagan, religion, in, his, praise, poetry, which, he, was, happy, enough, for, his, skalds, to, embellish, in, norse, mythology, while, other, viking, leaders, were, insistent, on, the, rigid, observation, of, the, christian, line, like, st, olaf, yet, he, also, displays, the, desire, for, a, respectable, christian, nationhood, within, europe, in, 1018, some, sources, suggest, he, was, at, canterbury, on, the, return, of, its, archbishop, lyfing, from, rome, to, receive, letters, of, exhortation, from, the, pope, if, this, chronology, is, correct, he, probably, went, from, canterbury, to, the, witan, at, oxford, with, archbishop, wulfstan, of, york, in, attendance, to, record, the, event, his, ecumenical, gifts, were, widespread, and, often, exuberant, commonly, held, land, was, given, along, with, exemption, from, taxes, as, well, as, relics, christ, church, was, probably, given, rights, at, the, important, port, of, sandwich, as, well, as, tax, exemption, with, confirmation, in, the, placement, of, their, charters, on, the, altar, while, it, got, the, relics, of, st, lfheah, at, the, displeasure, of, the, people, of, london, another, see, in, the, king, s, favour, was, winchester, second, only, to, the, canterbury, see, in, terms, of, wealth, the, new, minster, liber, vitae, records, cnut, as, a, benefactor, of, the, monastery, and, the, winchester, cross, with, 500, marks, of, silver, and, 30, marks, of, gold, as, well, as, relics, of, various, saints, was, given, to, it, old, minster, was, the, recipient, of, a, shrine, for, the, relics, of, st, birinus, and, the, probable, confirmation, of, its, privileges, the, monastery, at, evesham, with, its, abbot, lfweard, purportedly, a, relative, of, the, king, through, lfgifu, the, lady, probably, lfgifu, of, northampton, rather, than, queen, emma, also, known, as, lfgifu, got, the, relics, of, st, wigstan, while, some, english, approved, of, these, policies, which, his, skalds, called, destroying, treasure, the, burden, of, taxation, was, widely, felt, his, attitude, towards, london, s, see, was, clearly, not, benign, the, monasteries, at, ely, and, glastonbury, were, apparently, not, on, good, terms, either, other, gifts, were, also, given, to, his, neighbours, among, these, was, one, to, chartres, of, which, its, bishop, wrote, when, we, saw, the, gift, that, you, sent, us, we, were, amazed, at, your, knowledge, as, well, as, your, faith, since, you, whom, we, had, heard, to, be, a, pagan, prince, we, now, know, to, be, not, only, a, christian, but, also, a, most, generous, donor, to, god, s, churches, and, servants, he, is, known, to, have, sent, a, psalter, and, sacramentary, made, in, peterborough, famous, for, its, illustrations, to, cologne, and, a, book, written, in, gold, among, other, gifts, to, william, the, great, of, aquitaine, this, golden, book, was, apparently, to, support, aquitanian, claims, of, st, martial, patron, saint, of, aquitaine, as, an, apostle, of, some, consequence, its, recipient, was, an, avid, artisan, scholar, and, devout, christian, and, the, abbey, of, saint, martial, was, a, great, library, and, scriptorium, second, only, to, the, one, at, cluny, it, is, likely, that, cnut, s, gifts, were, well, beyond, historian, s, current, knowledge, cnut, s, journey, to, rome, in, 1027, is, another, sign, of, his, dedication, to, the, christian, religion, it, may, be, that, he, went, to, attend, the, coronation, of, conrad, ii, in, order, to, improve, relations, between, the, two, powers, yet, he, had, previously, made, a, vow, to, seek, the, favour, of, st, peter, the, keeper, of, the, keys, to, the, heavenly, kingdom, while, in, rome, cnut, made, an, agreement, with, the, pope, to, reduce, the, fees, paid, by, the, english, archbishops, to, receive, their, pallium, he, also, arranged, that, travellers, from, his, realm, not, be, straitened, by, unjust, tolls, and, that, they, should, be, safeguarded, on, their, way, to, and, from, rome, some, evidence, exists, for, a, second, journey, in, 1030, cnut, died, on, 12, november, 1035, in, shaftesbury, dorset, in, denmark, he, was, succeeded, by, harthacnut, reigning, as, cnut, iii, although, with, a, war, in, scandinavia, against, magnus, i, of, norway, harthacnut, was, forsaken, because, he, was, too, long, in, denmark, his, mother, queen, emma, previously, resident, at, winchester, with, some, of, her, son, s, housecarls, was, made, to, flee, to, bruges, in, flanders, under, pressure, from, supporters, of, cnut, s, other, son, after, svein, by, lfgifu, of, northampton, harold, harefoot, regent, in, england, 1035, 37, who, went, on, to, claim, the, english, throne, in, 1037, reigning, until, his, death, in, 1040, eventual, peace, in, scandinavia, left, harthacnut, free, to, claim, the, throne, himself, in, 1040, and, to, regain, for, his, mother, her, place, he, brought, the, crowns, of, denmark, and, england, together, again, until, his, death, in, 1042, denmark, fell, into, a, period, of, disorder, with, a, power, struggle, between, the, pretender, to, the, throne, sweyn, estridsson, son, of, ulf, and, the, norwegian, king, until, the, death, of, magnus, in, 1047, if, the, sons, of, cnut, had, not, died, within, a, decade, of, his, death, and, if, his, only, known, daughter, gunhilda, who, was, to, marry, conrad, ii, s, son, henry, iii, eight, months, after, his, death, had, not, died, in, italy, before, she, could, become, empress, consort, cnut, s, reign, might, well, have, been, the, foundation, for, a, complete, political, union, between, england, and, scandinavia, a, north, sea, empire, with, blood, ties, to, the, holy, roman, empire, cnut, was, buried, in, the, old, minster, winchester, with, the, events, of, 1066, the, new, regime, of, normandy, was, keen, to, signal, its, arrival, with, an, ambitious, programme, of, grandiose, cathedrals, and, castles, throughout, the, high, middle, ages, winchester, cathedral, was, built, on, the, old, anglo, saxon, site, and, the, previous, burials, including, cnut, s, were, set, in, mortuary, chests, there, during, the, english, civil, war, in, the, 17th, century, plundering, roundhead, soldiers, scattered, the, bones, of, cnut, on, the, floor, and, they, were, spread, amongst, the, various, other, chests, notably, those, of, william, rufus, after, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, the, bones, were, collected, and, replaced, in, their, chests, although, somewhat, out, of, order, the, old, norse, catalogue, of, skalds, known, as, sk, ldatal, lists, eight, skalds, who, were, active, at, cnut, s, court, four, of, them, namely, sigvatr, r, arson, ttarr, svarti, rarinn, loftunga, and, hallvar, r, h, reksblesi, composed, verses, in, honour, of, cnut, which, have, survived, in, some, form, while, no, such, thing, is, apparent, from, the, four, other, skalds, bersi, torfuson, arn, rr, r, arson, jarlask, ld, known, from, other, works, steinn, skaptason, and, arkeptr, unknown, the, principal, works, for, cnut, are, the, three, kn, tsdr, pur, by, sigvatr, r, arson, ttarr, svarti, and, hallvar, r, h, reksblesi, and, the, h, fu, lausn, and, t, gdr, pa, by, rarinn, loftunga, cnut, also, features, in, two, other, contemporary, skaldic, poems, namely, r, r, kolbeinsson, s, eir, ksdr, pa, and, the, anonymous, li, smannaflokkr, cnut, s, skalds, emphasise, the, parallelism, between, cnut, s, rule, of, his, earthly, kingdom, and, god, s, rule, of, heaven, this, is, particularly, apparent, in, their, refrains, thus, the, refrain, of, rarinn, s, h, fu, lausn, translates, to, cnut, protects, the, land, as, the, guardian, of, byzantium, heaven, and, the, refrain, of, hallvar, r, s, kn, tsdr, pa, translates, to, cnut, protects, the, land, as, the, lord, of, all, the, splendid, hall, of, the, mountains, despite, the, christian, message, the, poets, also, make, use, of, traditional, pagan, references, and, this, is, particularly, true, of, hallvar, r, as, an, example, one, of, his, half, stanzas, translates, to, the, freyr, of, the, noise, of, weapons, has, also, cast, under, him, norway, the, battle, server, diminishes, the, hunger, of, the, valcyrie, s, hawks, the, skald, here, refers, to, cnut, as, freyr, of, battle, a, kenning, using, the, name, of, the, pagan, god, freyr, references, of, this, sort, were, avoided, by, poets, composing, for, the, contemporary, kings, of, norway, but, cnut, seems, to, have, had, a, more, relaxed, attitude, towards, pagan, literary, allusions, this, story, of, cnut, resisting, the, incoming, tide, was, first, recorded, by, henry, of, huntingdon, in, his, historia, anglorum, in, the, early, twelfth, century, when, he, was, at, the, height, of, his, ascendancy, he, ordered, his, chair, to, be, placed, on, the, sea, shore, as, the, tide, was, coming, in, then, he, said, to, the, rising, tide, you, are, subject, to, me, as, the, land, on, which, i, am, sitting, is, mine, and, no, one, has, resisted, my, overlordship, with, impunity, i, command, you, therefore, not, to, rise, on, to, my, land, nor, to, presume, to, wet, the, clothing, or, limbs, of, your, master, but, the, sea, came, up, as, usual, and, disrespectfully, drenched, the, king, s, feet, and, shins, so, jumping, back, the, king, cried, let, all, the, world, know, that, the, power, of, kings, is, empty, and, worthless, and, there, is, no, king, worthy, of, the, name, save, him, by, whose, will, heaven, earth, and, the, sea, obey, eternal, laws, this, has, become, by, far, the, best, known, story, about, cnut, although, in, modern, readings, he, is, usually, a, wise, man, who, knows, from, the, start, that, he, cannot, control, the, waves
