franz, joseph, haydn, h, a, d, n, hy, d, n, german, 31, march, 1732, 31, may, 1809, was, an, austrian, composer, of, the, classical, period, he, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, chamber, music, such, as, the, string, quartet, and, piano, trio, his, contributions, to, musical, form, have, led, him, to, be, called, father, of, the, symphony, and, father, of, the, string, quartet, haydn, spent, much, of, his, career, as, a, court, musician, for, the, wealthy, esterh, zy, family, at, their, eszterh, za, castle, until, the, later, part, of, his, life, this, isolated, him, from, other, composers, and, trends, in, music, so, that, he, was, as, he, put, it, forced, to, become, original, yet, his, music, circulated, widely, and, for, much, of, his, career, he, was, the, most, celebrated, composer, in, europe, he, was, a, friend, and, mentor, of, mozart, a, tutor, of, beethoven, and, the, elder, brother, of, composer, michael, haydn, joseph, haydn, was, born, in, rohrau, austria, a, village, that, at, that, time, stood, on, the, border, with, hungary, his, father, was, mathias, haydn, a, wheelwright, who, also, served, as, marktrichter, or, marketplace, supervisor, haydn, s, mother, maria, n, e, koller, had, worked, as, a, cook, in, the, palace, of, aloys, thomas, raimund, count, von, harrach, the, presiding, aristocrat, of, rohrau, neither, parent, could, read, music, however, mathias, was, an, enthusiastic, folk, musician, who, during, the, journeyman, period, of, his, career, had, taught, himself, to, play, the, harp, according, to, haydn, s, later, reminiscences, his, family, was, extremely, musical, and, they, frequently, sang, together, and, with, their, neighbours, haydn, s, parents, had, noticed, that, their, son, was, musically, gifted, and, knew, that, in, rohrau, he, would, have, no, chance, to, obtain, serious, musical, training, it, was, for, this, reason, that, around, the, time, haydn, turned, six, they, accepted, a, proposal, from, their, relative, johann, matthias, frankh, the, schoolmaster, and, choirmaster, in, hainburg, that, haydn, be, apprenticed, to, frankh, in, his, home, to, train, as, a, musician, haydn, therefore, went, off, with, frankh, to, hainburg, and, he, never, again, lived, with, his, parents, life, in, the, frankh, household, was, not, easy, for, haydn, who, later, remembered, being, frequently, hungry, and, humiliated, by, the, filthy, state, of, his, clothing, he, began, his, musical, training, there, and, could, soon, play, both, harpsichord, and, violin, he, also, sang, treble, parts, in, the, church, choir, there, is, reason, to, think, that, haydn, s, singing, impressed, those, who, heard, him, because, in, 1739, he, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, georg, reutter, the, younger, the, director, of, music, in, st, stephen, s, cathedral, in, vienna, who, happened, to, be, visiting, hainburg, and, was, looking, for, new, choirboys, haydn, passed, his, audition, with, reutter, and, after, several, months, of, further, training, moved, to, vienna, 1740, where, he, worked, for, the, next, nine, years, as, a, chorister, haydn, lived, in, the, kapellhaus, next, to, the, cathedral, along, with, reutter, reutter, s, family, and, the, other, four, choirboys, which, after, 1745, included, his, younger, brother, michael, the, choirboys, were, instructed, in, latin, and, other, school, subjects, as, well, as, voice, violin, and, keyboard, reutter, was, of, little, help, to, haydn, in, the, areas, of, music, theory, and, composition, giving, him, only, two, lessons, in, his, entire, time, as, chorister, however, since, st, stephen, s, was, one, of, the, leading, musical, centres, in, europe, haydn, learned, a, great, deal, simply, by, serving, as, a, professional, musician, there, like, frankh, before, him, reutter, did, not, always, bother, to, make, sure, haydn, was, properly, fed, as, he, later, told, his, biographer, albert, christoph, dies, haydn, was, motivated, to, sing, well, in, hopes, of, gaining, more, invitations, to, perform, before, aristocratic, audiences, where, the, singers, were, usually, served, refreshments, by, 1749, haydn, had, matured, physically, to, the, point, that, he, was, no, longer, able, to, sing, high, choral, parts, empress, maria, theresa, herself, complained, to, reutter, about, his, singing, calling, it, crowing, one, day, haydn, carried, out, a, prank, snipping, off, the, pigtail, of, a, fellow, chorister, this, was, enough, for, reutter, haydn, was, first, caned, then, summarily, dismissed, and, sent, into, the, streets, he, had, the, good, fortune, to, be, taken, in, by, a, friend, johann, michael, spangler, who, shared, his, family, s, crowded, garret, room, with, haydn, for, a, few, months, haydn, immediately, began, his, pursuit, of, a, career, as, a, freelance, musician, haydn, struggled, at, first, working, at, many, different, jobs, as, a, music, teacher, as, a, street, serenader, and, eventually, in, 1752, as, valet, accompanist, for, the, italian, composer, nicola, porpora, from, whom, he, later, said, he, learned, the, true, fundamentals, of, composition, he, was, also, briefly, in, count, friedrich, wilhelm, von, haugwitz, s, employ, playing, the, organ, in, the, bohemian, chancellery, chapel, at, the, judenplatz, while, a, chorister, haydn, had, not, received, any, systematic, training, in, music, theory, and, composition, as, a, remedy, he, worked, his, way, through, the, counterpoint, exercises, in, the, text, gradus, ad, parnassum, by, johann, joseph, fux, and, carefully, studied, the, work, of, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, whom, he, later, acknowledged, as, an, important, influence, he, said, of, cpe, bach, s, first, six, keyboard, sonatas, i, did, not, leave, my, clavier, till, i, played, them, through, and, whoever, knows, me, thoroughly, must, discover, that, i, owe, a, great, deal, to, emanuel, bach, that, i, understood, him, and, have, studied, him, with, diligence, according, to, griesinger, and, dies, in, the, 1750s, haydn, studied, an, encyclopedic, treatise, by, johann, mattheson, a, german, composer, as, his, skills, increased, haydn, began, to, acquire, a, public, reputation, first, as, the, composer, of, an, opera, der, krumme, teufel, the, limping, devil, written, for, the, comic, actor, joseph, felix, von, kurz, whose, stage, name, was, bernardon, the, work, was, premiered, successfully, in, 1753, but, was, soon, closed, down, by, the, censors, due, to, offensive, remarks, haydn, also, noticed, apparently, without, annoyance, that, works, he, had, simply, given, away, were, being, published, and, sold, in, local, music, shops, between, 1754, and, 1756, haydn, also, worked, freelance, for, the, court, in, vienna, he, was, among, several, musicians, who, were, paid, for, services, as, supplementary, musicians, at, balls, given, for, the, imperial, children, during, carnival, season, and, as, supplementary, singers, in, the, imperial, chapel, the, hofkapelle, in, lent, and, holy, week, with, the, increase, in, his, reputation, haydn, eventually, obtained, aristocratic, patronage, crucial, for, the, career, of, a, composer, in, his, day, countess, thun, having, seen, one, of, haydn, s, compositions, summoned, him, and, engaged, him, as, her, singing, and, keyboard, teacher, in, 1756, baron, carl, josef, f, rnberg, employed, haydn, at, his, country, estate, weinzierl, where, the, composer, wrote, his, first, string, quartets, of, them, philip, g, downs, said, they, abound, in, novel, effects, and, instrumental, combinations, that, can, only, be, the, result, of, humorous, intent, their, enthusiastic, reception, encouraged, haydn, to, write, more, it, was, a, turning, point, in, his, career, as, a, result, of, the, performances, he, became, in, great, demand, both, as, a, performer, and, a, teacher, f, rnberg, later, recommended, haydn, to, count, morzin, who, in, 1757, became, his, first, full, time, employer, his, salary, was, a, respectable, 200, florins, a, year, plus, free, board, and, lodging, haydn, s, job, title, under, count, morzin, was, kapellmeister, that, is, music, director, he, led, the, count, s, small, orchestra, in, unterlukawitz, and, wrote, his, first, symphonies, for, this, ensemble, perhaps, numbering, in, the, double, figures, philip, downs, comments, of, these, first, symphonies, the, seeds, of, the, future, are, there, his, works, already, exhibit, a, richness, and, profusion, of, material, and, a, disciplined, yet, varied, expression, in, 1760, with, the, security, of, a, kapellmeister, position, haydn, married, his, wife, was, the, former, maria, anna, theresia, keller, 1729, 1800, the, sister, of, therese, b, 1733, with, whom, haydn, had, previously, been, in, love, haydn, and, his, wife, had, a, completely, unhappy, marriage, from, which, time, permitted, no, escape, they, produced, no, children, and, both, took, lovers, count, morzin, soon, suffered, financial, reverses, that, forced, him, to, dismiss, his, musical, establishment, but, haydn, was, quickly, offered, a, similar, job, 1761, by, prince, paul, anton, head, of, the, immensely, wealthy, esterh, zy, family, haydn, s, job, title, was, only, vice, kapellmeister, but, he, was, immediately, placed, in, charge, of, most, of, the, esterh, zy, musical, establishment, with, the, old, kapellmeister, gregor, werner, retaining, authority, only, for, church, music, when, werner, died, in, 1766, haydn, was, elevated, to, full, kapellmeister, as, a, house, officer, in, the, esterh, zy, establishment, haydn, wore, livery, and, followed, the, family, as, they, moved, among, their, various, palaces, most, importantly, the, family, s, ancestral, seat, schloss, esterh, zy, in, eisenstadt, and, later, on, esterh, za, a, grand, new, palace, built, in, rural, hungary, in, the, 1760s, haydn, had, a, huge, range, of, responsibilities, including, composition, running, the, orchestra, playing, chamber, music, for, and, with, his, patrons, and, eventually, the, mounting, of, operatic, productions, despite, this, backbreaking, workload, the, job, was, in, artistic, terms, a, superb, opportunity, for, haydn, the, esterh, zy, princes, paul, anton, then, from, 1762, to, 1790, nikolaus, i, were, musical, connoisseurs, who, appreciated, his, work, and, gave, him, daily, access, to, his, own, small, orchestra, during, the, nearly, thirty, years, that, haydn, worked, at, the, esterh, zy, court, he, produced, a, flood, of, compositions, and, his, musical, style, continued, to, develop, much, of, haydn, s, activity, at, the, time, followed, the, musical, taste, of, his, patron, prince, nikolaus, in, about, 1765, the, prince, obtained, and, began, to, learn, to, play, the, baryton, an, uncommon, musical, instrument, similar, to, the, bass, viol, but, with, a, set, of, plucked, sympathetic, strings, haydn, was, commanded, to, provide, music, for, the, prince, to, play, and, over, the, next, ten, years, produced, about, 200, works, for, this, instrument, in, various, ensembles, the, most, notable, of, which, are, the, 126, baryton, trios, around, 1775, the, prince, abandoned, the, baryton, and, took, up, a, new, hobby, opera, productions, previously, a, sporadic, event, for, special, occasions, became, the, focus, of, musical, life, at, court, and, the, opera, theater, the, prince, had, built, at, esterh, za, came, to, host, a, major, season, with, multiple, productions, each, year, haydn, served, as, company, director, recruiting, and, training, the, singers, and, preparing, and, leading, the, performances, he, wrote, several, of, the, operas, performed, and, wrote, substitution, arias, to, insert, into, the, operas, of, other, composers, 1779, was, a, watershed, year, for, haydn, as, his, contract, was, renegotiated, whereas, previously, all, his, compositions, were, the, property, of, the, esterh, zy, family, he, now, was, permitted, to, write, for, others, and, sell, his, work, to, publishers, haydn, soon, shifted, his, emphasis, in, composition, to, reflect, this, fewer, operas, and, more, quartets, and, symphonies, and, he, negotiated, with, multiple, publishers, both, austrian, and, foreign, his, new, employment, contract, acted, as, a, catalyst, in, the, next, stage, in, haydn, s, career, the, achievement, of, international, popularity, by, 1790, haydn, was, in, the, paradoxical, position, of, being, europe, s, leading, composer, but, someone, who, spent, his, time, as, a, duty, bound, kapellmeister, in, a, remote, palace, in, the, hungarian, countryside, the, new, publication, campaign, resulted, in, the, composition, of, a, great, number, of, new, string, quartets, the, six, quartet, sets, of, op, 33, 50, 54, 55, and, 64, haydn, also, composed, in, response, to, commissions, from, abroad, the, paris, symphonies, 1785, 1786, and, the, original, orchestral, version, of, the, seven, last, words, of, christ, 1786, a, commission, from, c, diz, spain, the, remoteness, of, eszterh, za, which, was, farther, from, vienna, than, eisenstadt, led, haydn, gradually, to, feel, more, isolated, and, lonely, he, longed, to, visit, vienna, because, of, his, friendships, there, of, these, a, particularly, important, one, was, with, maria, anna, von, genzinger, 1754, 1793, the, wife, of, prince, nikolaus, s, personal, physician, in, vienna, who, began, a, close, platonic, relationship, with, the, composer, in, 1789, haydn, wrote, to, mrs, genzinger, often, expressing, his, loneliness, at, esterh, za, and, his, happiness, for, the, few, occasions, on, which, he, was, able, to, visit, her, in, vienna, later, on, haydn, wrote, to, her, frequently, from, london, her, premature, death, in, 1793, was, a, blow, to, haydn, and, his, f, minor, variations, for, piano, hob, xvii, 6, may, have, been, written, in, response, to, her, death, another, friend, in, vienna, was, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, whom, haydn, had, met, sometime, around, 1784, according, to, later, testimony, by, michael, kelly, and, others, the, two, composers, occasionally, played, in, string, quartets, with, carl, ditters, von, dittersdorf, second, violin, and, johann, baptist, wanhal, cello, for, small, gatherings, attended, by, giovanni, paisiello, and, giovanni, battista, casti, impressed, by, mozart, s, work, haydn, praised, it, unstintingly, to, others, mozart, returned, the, esteem, in, his, haydn, quartets, in, 1785, haydn, was, admitted, to, the, same, masonic, lodge, as, mozart, the, zur, wahren, eintracht, in, vienna, in, 1790, prince, nikolaus, died, and, was, succeeded, as, prince, by, his, son, anton, following, a, trend, of, the, time, anton, sought, to, economize, by, dismissing, most, of, the, court, musicians, haydn, retained, a, nominal, appointment, with, anton, at, a, reduced, salary, of, 400, florins, as, well, as, a, 1000, florin, pension, from, nikolaus, since, anton, had, little, need, of, haydn, s, services, he, was, willing, to, let, him, travel, and, the, composer, accepted, a, lucrative, offer, from, johann, peter, salomon, a, german, violinist, and, impresario, to, visit, england, and, conduct, new, symphonies, with, a, large, orchestra, the, choice, was, a, sensible, one, because, haydn, was, already, a, very, popular, composer, there, since, the, death, of, johann, christian, bach, in, 1782, haydn, s, music, had, dominated, the, concert, scene, in, london, hardly, a, concert, did, not, feature, a, work, by, him, haydn, s, work, was, widely, distributed, by, publishers, in, london, including, forster, who, had, their, own, contract, with, haydn, and, longman, broderip, who, served, as, agent, in, england, for, haydn, s, vienna, publisher, artaria, efforts, to, bring, haydn, to, london, had, been, made, since, 1782, though, haydn, s, loyalty, to, prince, nikolaus, had, prevented, him, from, accepting, after, fond, farewells, from, mozart, and, other, friends, haydn, departed, from, vienna, with, salomon, on, 15, december, 1790, arriving, in, calais, in, time, to, cross, the, english, channel, on, new, year, s, day, of, 1791, it, was, the, first, time, that, the, 58, year, old, composer, had, seen, the, sea, arriving, in, london, haydn, stayed, with, salomon, in, great, pulteney, street, london, near, piccadilly, circus, working, in, a, borrowed, studio, at, the, broadwood, piano, firm, nearby, it, was, the, start, of, a, very, auspicious, period, for, haydn, both, the, 1791, 1792, journey, along, with, a, repeat, visit, in, 1794, 1795, were, greatly, successful, audiences, flocked, to, haydn, s, concerts, he, augmented, his, fame, and, made, large, profits, thus, becoming, financially, secure, charles, burney, reviewed, the, first, concert, thus, haydn, himself, presided, at, the, piano, forte, and, the, sight, of, that, renowned, composer, so, electrified, the, audience, as, to, excite, an, attention, and, a, pleasure, superior, to, any, that, had, ever, been, caused, by, instrumental, music, in, england, haydn, made, many, new, friends, and, for, a, time, was, involved, in, a, romantic, relationship, with, rebecca, schroeter, musically, haydn, s, visits, to, england, generated, some, of, his, best, known, work, including, the, surprise, military, drumroll, and, london, symphonies, the, rider, quartet, and, the, gypsy, rondo, piano, trio, the, great, success, of, the, overall, enterprise, does, not, mean, that, the, journeys, were, free, of, trouble, notably, his, first, project, the, commissioned, opera, l, anima, del, filosofo, was, duly, written, during, the, early, stages, of, the, trip, but, the, opera, s, impresario, john, gallini, was, unable, to, obtain, a, license, to, permit, opera, performances, in, the, theatre, he, directed, the, king, s, theatre, haydn, was, well, paid, for, the, opera, 300, but, much, time, was, wasted, thus, only, two, new, symphonies, no, 95, and, no, 96, miracle, could, be, premiered, in, the, 12, concerts, of, salomon, s, spring, concert, series, in, 1791, another, problem, arose, from, the, jealously, competitive, efforts, of, a, senior, rival, orchestra, the, professional, concerts, who, recruited, haydn, s, old, pupil, ignaz, pleyel, as, a, rival, visiting, composer, the, two, composers, refusing, to, play, along, with, the, concocted, rivalry, dined, together, and, put, each, other, s, symphonies, on, their, concert, programs, the, end, of, salomon, s, series, in, june, gave, haydn, a, rare, period, of, relative, leisure, he, spent, some, of, the, time, in, the, country, hertingfordbury, but, also, had, time, to, travel, notably, to, oxford, where, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, by, the, university, the, symphony, performed, for, the, occasion, no, 92, has, since, come, to, be, known, as, the, oxford, symphony, although, it, had, been, written, two, years, before, in, 1789, four, further, new, symphonies, nos, 93, 94, 97, and, 98, were, performed, in, early, 1792, while, traveling, to, london, in, 1790, haydn, had, met, the, young, ludwig, van, beethoven, in, his, native, city, of, bonn, on, haydn, s, return, beethoven, came, to, vienna, and, was, haydn, s, pupil, up, until, the, second, london, journey, haydn, took, beethoven, with, him, to, eisenstadt, for, the, summer, where, haydn, had, little, to, do, and, taught, beethoven, some, counterpoint, while, in, vienna, haydn, purchased, a, house, for, himself, and, his, wife, in, the, suburbs, and, started, remodeling, it, he, also, arranged, for, the, performance, of, some, of, his, london, symphonies, in, local, concerts, by, the, time, he, arrived, on, his, second, journey, to, england, 1794, 1795, haydn, had, become, a, familiar, figure, on, the, london, concert, scene, the, 1794, season, was, dominated, by, salomon, s, ensemble, as, the, professional, concerts, had, abandoned, their, efforts, the, concerts, included, the, premieres, of, the, 99th, 100th, and, 101st, symphonies, for, 1795, salomon, had, abandoned, his, own, series, citing, difficulty, in, obtaining, vocal, performers, of, the, first, rank, from, abroad, and, haydn, joined, forces, with, the, opera, concerts, headed, by, the, violinist, giovanni, battista, viotti, these, were, the, venue, of, the, last, three, symphonies, 102, 103, and, 104, the, final, benefit, concert, for, haydn, dr, haydn, s, night, at, the, end, of, the, 1795, season, was, a, great, success, and, was, perhaps, the, peak, of, his, english, career, haydn, s, biographer, griesinger, wrote, that, haydn, considered, the, days, spent, in, england, the, happiest, of, his, life, he, was, everywhere, appreciated, there, it, opened, a, new, world, to, him, haydn, returned, to, vienna, in, 1795, prince, anton, had, died, and, his, successor, nikolaus, ii, proposed, that, the, esterh, zy, musical, establishment, be, revived, with, haydn, serving, again, as, kapellmeister, haydn, took, up, the, position, on, a, part, time, basis, he, spent, his, summers, with, the, esterh, zys, in, eisenstadt, and, over, the, course, of, several, years, wrote, six, masses, for, them, including, the, lord, nelson, mass, in, 1798, by, this, time, haydn, had, become, a, public, figure, in, vienna, he, spent, most, of, his, time, in, his, home, a, large, house, in, the, suburb, of, windm, hle, and, wrote, works, for, public, performance, in, collaboration, with, his, librettist, and, mentor, gottfried, van, swieten, and, with, funding, from, van, swieten, s, gesellschaft, der, associierten, he, composed, his, two, great, oratorios, the, creation, 1798, and, the, seasons, 1801, both, were, enthusiastically, received, haydn, frequently, appeared, before, the, public, often, leading, performances, of, the, creation, and, the, seasons, for, charity, benefits, including, tonk, nstler, societ, t, programs, with, massed, musical, forces, he, also, composed, instrumental, music, the, popular, trumpet, concerto, and, the, last, nine, in, his, long, series, of, string, quartets, including, the, fifths, emperor, and, sunrise, directly, inspired, by, hearing, audiences, sing, god, save, the, king, in, london, in, 1797, haydn, wrote, a, patriotic, emperor, s, hymn, gott, erhalte, franz, den, kaiser, god, save, emperor, francis, this, achieved, great, success, and, became, the, enduring, emblem, of, austrian, identity, right, up, to, the, first, world, war, jones, the, melody, was, used, for, von, fallersleben, s, deutschlandlied, 1841, which, was, written, as, part, of, the, german, unification, movement, and, whose, third, stanza, is, today, the, national, anthem, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, modern, austria, uses, a, different, anthem, during, the, later, years, of, this, successful, period, haydn, faced, incipient, old, age, and, fluctuating, health, and, he, had, to, struggle, to, complete, his, final, works, his, last, major, work, from, 1802, was, the, sixth, mass, for, the, esterh, zys, the, harmoniemesse, by, the, end, of, 1803, haydn, s, condition, had, declined, to, the, point, that, he, became, physically, unable, to, compose, he, suffered, from, weakness, dizziness, inability, to, concentrate, and, painfully, swollen, legs, since, diagnosis, was, uncertain, in, haydn, s, time, it, is, unlikely, that, the, precise, illness, can, ever, be, identified, though, jones, suggests, arteriosclerosis, the, illness, was, especially, hard, for, haydn, because, the, flow, of, fresh, musical, ideas, continued, unabated, although, he, could, no, longer, work, them, out, as, compositions, his, biographer, dies, reported, haydn, saying, in, 1806, i, must, have, something, to, do, usually, musical, ideas, are, pursuing, me, to, the, point, of, torture, i, cannot, escape, them, they, stand, like, walls, before, me, if, it, s, an, allegro, that, pursues, me, my, pulse, keeps, beating, faster, i, can, get, no, sleep, if, it, s, an, adagio, then, i, notice, my, pulse, beating, slowly, my, imagination, plays, on, me, as, if, i, were, a, clavier, haydn, smiled, the, blood, rushed, to, his, face, and, he, said, i, am, really, just, a, living, clavier, the, winding, down, of, haydn, s, career, was, gradual, the, esterh, zy, family, kept, him, on, as, kapellmeister, to, the, very, end, much, as, they, had, with, his, predecessor, werner, long, before, but, they, appointed, new, staff, to, lead, their, musical, establishment, johann, michael, fuchs, in, 1802, as, vice, kapellmeister, and, johann, nepomuk, hummel, as, konzertmeister, in, 1804, haydn, s, last, summer, in, eisenstadt, was, in, 1803, and, his, last, appearance, before, the, public, as, a, conductor, was, a, charity, performance, of, the, seven, last, words, on, 26, december, 1803, as, debility, set, in, he, made, largely, futile, efforts, at, composition, attempting, to, revise, a, rediscovered, missa, brevis, from, his, teenage, years, and, complete, his, final, string, quartet, the, former, project, was, abandoned, for, good, in, 1805, and, the, quartet, was, published, with, just, two, movements, haydn, was, well, cared, for, by, his, servants, and, he, received, many, visitors, and, public, honors, during, his, last, years, but, they, could, not, have, been, very, happy, years, for, him, during, his, illness, haydn, often, found, solace, by, sitting, at, the, piano, and, playing, his, emperor, s, hymn, a, final, triumph, occurred, on, 27, march, 1808, when, a, performance, of, the, creation, was, organized, in, his, honour, the, very, frail, composer, was, brought, into, the, hall, on, an, armchair, to, the, sound, of, trumpets, and, drums, and, was, greeted, by, beethoven, salieri, who, led, the, performance, and, by, other, musicians, and, members, of, the, aristocracy, haydn, was, both, moved, and, exhausted, by, the, experience, and, had, to, depart, at, intermission, haydn, lived, on, for, 14, more, months, his, final, days, were, hardly, serene, as, in, may, 1809, the, french, army, under, napoleon, launched, an, attack, on, vienna, and, on, 10, may, bombarded, his, neighborhood, according, to, griesinger, four, case, shots, fell, rattling, the, windows, and, doors, of, his, house, he, called, out, in, a, loud, voice, to, his, alarmed, and, frightened, people, don, t, be, afraid, children, where, haydn, is, no, harm, can, reach, you, but, the, spirit, was, stronger, than, the, flesh, for, he, had, hardly, uttered, the, brave, words, when, his, whole, body, began, to, tremble, more, bombardments, followed, until, the, city, fell, to, the, french, on, 13, may, haydn, was, however, deeply, moved, and, appreciative, when, on, 17, may, a, french, cavalry, officer, named, sul, my, came, to, pay, his, respects, and, sang, skillfully, an, aria, from, the, creation, on, 26, may, haydn, played, his, emperor, s, hymn, with, unusual, gusto, three, times, the, same, evening, he, collapsed, and, was, taken, to, what, proved, to, be, to, his, deathbed, he, died, peacefully, in, his, own, home, at, 12, 40, a, m, on, 31, may, 1809, aged, 77, on, 15, june, a, memorial, service, was, held, in, the, schottenkirche, at, which, mozart, s, requiem, was, performed, haydn, s, remains, were, interred, in, the, local, hundsturm, cemetery, until, 1820, when, they, were, moved, to, eisenstadt, by, prince, nikolaus, his, head, took, a, different, journey, it, was, stolen, by, phrenologists, shortly, after, burial, and, the, skull, was, reunited, with, the, other, remains, only, in, 1954, now, interred, in, a, tomb, in, the, north, tower, of, the, bergkirche, james, webster, writes, of, haydn, s, public, character, thus, haydn, s, public, life, exemplified, the, enlightenment, ideal, of, the, honn, te, homme, honest, man, the, man, whose, good, character, and, worldly, success, enable, and, justify, each, other, his, modesty, and, probity, were, everywhere, acknowledged, these, traits, were, not, only, prerequisites, to, his, success, as, kapellmeister, entrepreneur, and, public, figure, but, also, aided, the, favorable, reception, of, his, music, haydn, was, especially, respected, by, the, esterh, zy, court, musicians, whom, he, supervised, as, he, maintained, a, cordial, working, atmosphere, and, effectively, represented, the, musicians, interests, with, their, employer, see, papa, haydn, and, the, tale, of, the, farewell, symphony, haydn, had, a, robust, sense, of, humor, evident, in, his, love, of, practical, jokes, and, often, apparent, in, his, music, and, he, had, many, friends, for, much, of, his, life, he, benefited, from, a, happy, and, naturally, cheerful, temperament, but, in, his, later, life, there, is, evidence, for, periods, of, depression, notably, in, the, correspondence, with, mrs, genzinger, and, in, dies, s, biography, based, on, visits, made, in, haydn, s, old, age, haydn, was, a, devout, catholic, who, often, turned, to, his, rosary, when, he, had, trouble, composing, a, practice, that, he, usually, found, to, be, effective, he, normally, began, the, manuscript, of, each, composition, with, in, nomine, domini, and, ended, with, laus, deo, he, retained, this, practice, even, in, his, secular, works, he, frequently, only, uses, the, initials, l, d, s, d, g, or, laus, deo, et, b, v, m, and, sometimes, adds, et, om, s, si, s, et, omnibus, sanctis, and, all, saints, haydn, s, early, years, of, poverty, and, awareness, of, the, financial, precariousness, of, musical, life, made, him, astute, and, even, sharp, in, his, business, dealings, some, contemporaries, usually, it, has, to, be, said, wealthy, ones, were, surprised, and, even, shocked, at, this, webster, writes, as, regards, money, haydn, always, attempted, to, maximize, his, income, whether, by, negotiating, the, right, to, sell, his, music, outside, the, esterh, zy, court, driving, hard, bargains, with, publishers, or, selling, his, works, three, and, four, times, over, he, regularly, engaged, in, sharp, practice, which, nowadays, might, be, regarded, as, plain, fraud, but, those, were, days, when, copyright, was, in, its, infancy, and, the, pirating, of, musical, works, was, common, publishers, had, few, qualms, about, attaching, haydn, s, name, to, popular, works, by, lesser, composers, an, arrangement, that, effectively, robbed, the, lesser, musician, of, livelihood, webster, notes, that, haydn, s, ruthlessness, in, business, might, be, viewed, more, sympathetically, in, light, of, his, struggles, with, poverty, during, his, years, as, a, freelancer, and, that, outside, the, world, of, business, in, his, dealings, for, example, with, relatives, musicians, and, servants, and, in, volunteering, his, services, for, charitable, concerts, haydn, was, a, generous, man, e, g, offering, to, teach, the, two, infant, sons, of, mozart, for, free, after, their, father, s, death, when, haydn, died, he, was, certainly, comfortably, off, but, by, middle, class, rather, than, aristocratic, standards, haydn, was, short, in, stature, perhaps, as, a, result, of, having, been, underfed, throughout, most, of, his, youth, he, was, not, handsome, and, like, many, in, his, day, he, was, a, survivor, of, smallpox, his, face, was, pitted, with, the, scars, of, this, disease, his, biographer, dies, wrote, he, couldn, t, understand, how, it, happened, that, in, his, life, he, had, been, loved, by, many, a, pretty, woman, they, couldn, t, have, been, led, to, it, by, my, beauty, haydn, had, a, dark, complexion, and, black, eyes, his, nose, large, and, aquiline, was, disfigured, by, the, polyps, he, suffered, during, much, of, his, adult, life, an, agonizing, and, debilitating, disease, that, at, times, prevented, him, from, writing, music, james, webster, summarizes, haydn, s, role, in, the, history, of, classical, music, as, follows, he, excelled, in, every, musical, genre, he, is, familiarly, known, as, the, father, of, the, symphony, because, he, composed, 107, symphonies, and, could, with, greater, justice, be, thus, regarded, for, the, string, quartet, no, other, composer, approaches, his, combination, of, productivity, quality, and, historical, importance, in, these, genres, a, central, characteristic, of, haydn, s, music, is, the, development, of, larger, structures, out, of, very, short, simple, musical, motifs, often, derived, from, standard, accompanying, figures, the, music, is, often, quite, formally, concentrated, and, the, important, musical, events, of, a, movement, can, unfold, rather, quickly, haydn, s, work, was, central, to, the, development, of, what, came, to, be, called, sonata, form, his, practice, however, differed, in, some, ways, from, that, of, mozart, and, beethoven, his, younger, contemporaries, who, likewise, excelled, in, this, form, of, composition, haydn, was, particularly, fond, of, the, so, called, monothematic, exposition, in, which, the, music, that, establishes, the, dominant, key, is, similar, or, identical, to, the, opening, theme, haydn, also, differs, from, mozart, and, beethoven, in, his, recapitulation, sections, where, he, often, rearranges, the, order, of, themes, compared, to, the, exposition, and, uses, extensive, thematic, development, haydn, s, formal, inventiveness, also, led, him, to, integrate, the, fugue, into, the, classical, style, and, to, enrich, the, rondo, form, with, more, cohesive, tonal, logic, see, sonata, rondo, form, haydn, was, also, the, principal, exponent, of, the, double, variation, form, variations, on, two, alternating, themes, which, are, often, major, and, minor, mode, versions, of, each, other, perhaps, more, than, any, other, composer, s, haydn, s, music, is, known, for, its, humor, the, most, famous, example, is, the, sudden, loud, chord, in, the, slow, movement, of, his, surprise, symphony, haydn, s, many, other, musical, jokes, include, numerous, false, endings, e, g, in, the, quartets, op, 33, no, 2, and, op, 50, no, 3, and, the, remarkable, rhythmic, illusion, placed, in, the, trio, section, of, the, third, movement, of, op, 50, no, 1, the, tone, of, haydn, s, music, also, reflects, perhaps, haydn, s, fundamentally, healthy, and, well, balanced, personality, occasional, minor, key, works, often, deadly, serious, in, character, form, striking, exceptions, to, the, general, rule, haydn, s, fast, movements, tend, to, be, rhythmically, propulsive, and, often, impart, a, great, sense, of, energy, especially, in, the, finales, some, characteristic, examples, of, haydn, s, rollicking, finale, type, are, found, in, the, london, symphony, no, 104, the, string, quartet, op, 50, no, 1, and, the, piano, trio, hob, xv, 27, haydn, s, early, slow, movements, are, usually, not, too, slow, in, tempo, relaxed, and, reflective, later, on, the, emotional, range, of, the, slow, movements, increases, notably, in, the, deeply, felt, slow, movements, of, the, quartets, op, 76, nos, 3, and, 5, the, symphonies, no, 98, and, 102, and, the, piano, trio, hob, xv, 23, the, minuets, tend, to, have, a, strong, downbeat, and, a, clearly, popular, character, over, time, haydn, turned, some, of, his, minuets, into, scherzi, which, are, much, faster, at, one, beat, to, the, bar, one, of, the, most, apt, tributes, to, haydn, was, spoken, by, the, poet, john, keats, keats, dying, of, tuberculosis, was, brought, to, rome, by, his, friends, in, november, 1820, in, the, hope, that, the, climate, might, help, to, mitigate, his, suffering, the, poet, died, a, few, weeks, later, on, 23, february, 1821, at, the, age, of, 25, according, to, his, friend, joseph, severn, about, this, time, he, expressed, a, strong, desire, that, we, had, a, pianoforte, so, that, i, might, play, to, him, for, not, only, was, he, passionately, fond, of, music, but, found, that, his, constant, pain, and, o, erfretted, nerves, were, much, soothed, by, it, this, i, managed, to, obtain, on, loan, and, dr, clark, procured, me, many, volumes, and, pieces, of, music, and, keats, had, thus, a, welcome, solace, in, the, dreary, hours, he, had, to, pass, among, the, volumes, was, one, of, haydn, s, symphonies, and, these, were, his, delight, and, he, would, exclaim, enthusiastically, this, haydn, is, like, a, child, for, there, is, no, knowing, what, he, will, do, next, haydn, s, early, work, dates, from, a, period, in, which, the, compositional, style, of, the, high, baroque, seen, in, j, s, bach, and, handel, had, gone, out, of, fashion, this, was, a, period, of, exploration, and, uncertainty, and, haydn, born, 18, years, before, the, death, of, bach, was, himself, one, of, the, musical, explorers, of, this, time, an, older, contemporary, whose, work, haydn, acknowledged, as, an, important, influence, was, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, tracing, haydn, s, work, over, the, six, decades, in, which, it, was, produced, roughly, from, 1749, to, 1802, one, finds, a, gradual, but, steady, increase, in, complexity, and, musical, sophistication, which, developed, as, haydn, learned, from, his, own, experience, and, that, of, his, colleagues, several, important, landmarks, have, been, observed, in, the, evolution, of, haydn, s, musical, style, in, the, late, 1760s, and, early, 1770s, haydn, entered, a, stylistic, period, known, as, sturm, und, drang, storm, and, stress, this, term, is, taken, from, a, literary, movement, of, about, the, same, time, though, it, appears, that, the, musical, development, actually, preceded, the, literary, one, by, a, few, years, the, musical, language, of, this, period, is, similar, to, what, went, before, but, it, is, deployed, in, work, that, is, more, intensely, expressive, especially, in, the, works, in, minor, keys, james, webster, describes, the, works, of, this, period, as, longer, more, passionate, and, more, daring, some, of, the, most, famous, compositions, of, this, time, are, the, trauer, mourning, symphony, no, 44, farewell, symphony, no, 45, the, piano, sonata, in, c, minor, hob, xvi, 20, l, 33, and, the, six, sun, quartets, op, 20, all, from, c, 1771, 72, it, was, also, around, this, time, that, haydn, became, interested, in, writing, fugues, in, the, baroque, style, and, three, of, the, op, 20, quartets, end, with, a, fugue, following, the, climax, of, the, sturm, und, drang, haydn, returned, to, a, lighter, more, overtly, entertaining, style, there, are, no, quartets, from, this, period, and, the, symphonies, take, on, new, features, the, scoring, often, includes, trumpets, and, timpani, these, changes, are, often, related, to, a, major, shift, in, haydn, s, professional, duties, which, moved, him, away, from, pure, music, and, toward, the, production, of, comic, operas, several, of, the, operas, were, haydn, s, own, work, see, list, of, operas, by, joseph, haydn, these, are, seldom, performed, today, haydn, sometimes, recycled, his, opera, music, in, symphonic, works, which, helped, him, continue, his, career, as, a, symphonist, during, this, hectic, decade, in, 1779, an, important, change, in, haydn, s, contract, permitted, him, to, publish, his, compositions, without, prior, authorization, from, his, employer, this, may, have, encouraged, haydn, to, rekindle, his, career, as, a, composer, of, pure, music, the, change, made, itself, felt, most, dramatically, in, 1781, when, haydn, published, the, six, op, 33, string, quartets, announcing, in, a, letter, to, potential, purchasers, that, they, were, written, in, a, new, and, completely, special, way, charles, rosen, has, argued, that, this, assertion, on, haydn, s, part, was, not, just, sales, talk, but, meant, quite, seriously, and, he, points, out, a, number, of, important, advances, in, haydn, s, compositional, technique, that, appear, in, these, quartets, advances, that, mark, the, advent, of, the, classical, style, in, full, flower, these, include, a, fluid, form, of, phrasing, in, which, each, motif, emerges, from, the, previous, one, without, interruption, the, practice, of, letting, accompanying, material, evolve, into, melodic, material, and, a, kind, of, classical, counterpoint, in, which, each, instrumental, part, maintains, its, own, integrity, these, traits, continue, in, the, many, quartets, that, haydn, wrote, after, op, 33, in, the, 1790s, stimulated, by, his, england, journeys, haydn, developed, what, rosen, calls, his, popular, style, a, method, of, composition, that, with, unprecedented, success, created, music, having, great, popular, appeal, but, retaining, a, learned, and, rigorous, musical, structure, an, important, element, of, the, popular, style, was, the, frequent, use, of, folk, or, folk, like, material, see, haydn, and, folk, music, haydn, took, care, to, deploy, this, material, in, appropriate, locations, such, as, the, endings, of, sonata, expositions, or, the, opening, themes, of, finales, in, such, locations, the, folk, material, serves, as, an, element, of, stability, helping, to, anchor, the, larger, structure, haydn, s, popular, style, can, be, heard, in, virtually, all, of, his, later, work, including, the, twelve, london, symphonies, the, late, quartets, and, piano, trios, and, the, two, late, oratorios, the, return, to, vienna, in, 1795, marked, the, last, turning, point, in, haydn, s, career, although, his, musical, style, evolved, little, his, intentions, as, a, composer, changed, while, he, had, been, a, servant, and, later, a, busy, entrepreneur, haydn, wrote, his, works, quickly, and, in, profusion, with, frequent, deadlines, as, a, rich, man, haydn, now, felt, that, he, had, the, privilege, of, taking, his, time, and, writing, for, posterity, this, is, reflected, in, the, subject, matter, of, the, creation, 1798, and, the, seasons, 1801, which, address, such, weighty, topics, as, the, meaning, of, life, and, the, purpose, of, humankind, and, represent, an, attempt, to, render, the, sublime, in, music, haydn, s, new, intentions, also, meant, that, he, was, willing, to, spend, much, time, on, a, single, work, both, oratorios, took, him, over, a, year, to, complete, haydn, once, remarked, that, he, had, worked, on, the, creation, so, long, because, he, wanted, it, to, last, the, change, in, haydn, s, approach, was, important, in, the, history, of, classical, music, as, other, composers, were, soon, following, his, lead, notably, beethoven, adopted, the, practice, of, taking, his, time, and, aiming, high, anthony, van, hoboken, prepared, a, comprehensive, catalogue, of, haydn, s, works, the, hoboken, catalogue, assigns, a, catalog, number, to, each, work, called, its, hoboken, number, abbreviated, h, or, hob, these, hoboken, numbers, are, often, used, in, identifying, haydn, s, compositions, haydn, s, string, quartets, also, have, hoboken, numbers, but, they, are, usually, identified, instead, by, their, opus, numbers, which, have, the, advantage, of, indicating, the, groups, of, six, quartets, that, haydn, published, together, for, example, the, string, quartet, opus, 76, no, 3, is, the, third, of, the, six, quartets, published, in, 1799, as, opus, 76, an, anton, walter, in, wien, fortepiano, used, by, the, composer, is, now, on, display, in, the, haydn, haus, eisenstadt, in, vienna, in, 1788, haydn, bought, himself, a, fortepiano, made, by, wenzel, schantz, when, the, composer, was, visiting, london, for, the, first, time, an, english, piano, builder, john, broadwood, supplied, him, with, a, concert, grand, informational, notes, citations, bibliography, biographical, sources, criticism, and, analysis
