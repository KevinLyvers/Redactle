on, foot, around, this, time, he, knew, he, would, be, a, filmmaker, and, learned, the, basics, from, a, few, pages, in, an, encyclopedia, which, provided, him, with, everything, i, needed, to, get,

superficial, truth, the, truth, of, accountants, herzog, explained, that, there, are, deeper, strata, of, truth, in, cinema, and, there, is, such, a, thing, as, poetic, ecstatic, truth, it, is, mysterious, and, elusive, and, can, be, reached, only, through, fabrication, and, imagination, and, stylization, and, that, facts, sometimes, have, a, strange, and, bizarre, power, that, makes, their, inherent, truth, seem, unbelievable, ebert, later, wrote, of, its, significance, for, the, first, time, it, fully, explained, his, theory, of, ecstatic, truth, in, 2017, herzog, wrote, a, six, point, addendum, to, the, manifesto, prompted, by, a, question, about, truth, in, an, age, of, alt, facts, his, treatment, of, subjects, has, been, characterized, as, wagnerian, in, its, scope, but, film,
