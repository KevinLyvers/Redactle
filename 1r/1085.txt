endeavoring, to, penetrate, into, present, day, gujarat, through, the, thar, desert, only, to, end, up, getting, wounded, and, routed, near, mount, abu, at, kasahrada, by, a, coalition, of, rajput, chiefs, led, by, the, chaulukya, king, mularaja, which, forced, him, to, change, his, route, for, future, inroads, into, the, indian, plains, hence, muhammad, pressed, upon, the, ghaznavids, and, uprooted, them, by, 1186, conquering, the, upper, indus, plain, along, with, most, of, the, punjab, after, expelling, the, ghaznavids, from, their, last, bastion, muhammad, thus, secured, the, khyber, pass, the, traditional, route, of, entry, for, invading, armies, into, northern, india, extending, the, ghurid, dominion, further, eastwards, into, the, gangetic, plain, the, ghurid, forces, suffered, a, decisive, reverse, and, muhammad, himself, got, wounded, in, engagement, with, the, rajput, confederacy, led, by, the, chahamana, ruler, prithviraj, chauhan, at, tarain, in, 1191, muhammad, returned, to, khurasan, and, returned, a, year, later, with, a, vast, army, of, mounted, archers, to, secure, a, decisive, victory, in, the, return, engagement, on, the, same, battleground, and, executed, prithviraj, shortly, afterwards, he, limited, his, presence, in, india, afterwards, deputing, the, political, and, military, operations, in, the, region, to, a, handful, of, elite, slave,

the, death, of, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, in, 1203, muhammad, of, ghor, ascended, the, throne, of, firozkoh, as, well, becoming, the, supreme, sultan, of, the, ghurid, empire, within, a, year, or, so, muhammad, suffered, a, devastating, defeat, at, andkhud, against, their, turkish, rivals, khwarazmians, aided, by, timely, reinforcements, from, the, qara, khitais, which, resulted, in, the, ghurid, power, ebbing, out, in, most, of, the, khurasan, muhammad, quelled, the, widespread, insurrection, throughout, his, empire, after, the, debacle, and, ordered, the, construction, of, a, bridge, over, the, oxus, river, to, launch, a, full, scale, invasion, of, transoxiana, in, order, to, avenge, his, defeat, at, andkhud, although, a, rebellion, by, the, hindu, khokhars, forced, him, to, move, towards, the, salt, range, where, he, brutually, crushed, the, khokhar, revolt, during, his, last, campaign, on, his, way, back, muhammad, of, ghor, was, assassinated, on, the, bank, of, indus, at, damyak, on, 15, march, 1206, by, the, ism, l, emissaries, while, offering, evening, prayers, muhammad, s, assassination, led, to, the, rapid, decline, of, the, ghurids, and, enabled, shah, muhammad, ii, to, annex, remaining, ghurid, territories, west, of, the, indus, river, by, 1215, however, his, conquests, east, of, the, indus, in, the, indian, subcontinent, evolved, into, the, formidable, delhi, sultanate, under, his, slave, commander, qutbuddin, aibak, muhammad, of, ghor, was, born, in, the, ghur, region, of, present, day, west, central, afghanistan, to, the, ghurid, ruler, baha, al, din, sam, i, who, ruled, his, ancestral, realm, briefly, before, he, died, in, 1149, when, muhammad, of, ghor, was, a, child, his, name, is, variously, transliterated, as, muizuddin, sam, shihabuddin, ghuri, muhammad, ghori, and, muhammad, of, ghor, according, to, the, tabaqat, i, nasiri, his, birth, name, was, muhammad, which, is, vernacularly, spelt, as, hamad, by, the, ghurids, during, his, childhood, his, mother, used, to, call, him, zangi, due, to, his, dark, skin, tone, after, the, coronation, in, ghazni, he, styled, himself, as, malik, shihabuddin, and, after, his, occupation, of, khurasan, he, took, the, title, of, muizzuddin, or, mu, izz, al, din, the, synchronous, accounts, did, not, write, much, about, muhammad, s, exact, birth, date, although, based, on, the, writings, of, juzjani, muhammad, was, younger, to, ghiyath, al, din, by, three, years, and, few, months, who, was, born, in, 1140, therefore, muhammad, s, birth, year, can, be, dated, to, 1144, the, early, years, of, both, muhammad, and, his, brother, ghiyath, al, din, were, spent, in, constant, hardship, their, uncle, ala, al, din, husayn, after, his, campaign, in, ghazni, initially, installed, them, as, governors, of, sanjah, however, their, efficient, administration, of, the, province, made, him, doubtful, of, their, uprise, and, seeing, a, possible, challenge, to, his, own, authority, he, ordered, his, nephews, to, be, imprisoned, in, the, castle, of, gharjistan, although, they, were, released, from, the, captivity, by, his, son, sayf, al, din, muhammad, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1161, sayf, al, din, later, died, in, a, battle, against, the, nomadic, oghuzs, of, balkh, after, their, release, from, the, captivity, tarik, i, firishtah, states, that, the, ghurid, siblings, were, reinstated, in, sanjah, although, the, earlier, account, of, tabaqat, i, nasiri, stated, that, the, hardship, continued, due, to, their, financial, conditions, muhammad, thus, took, shelter, in, the, court, of, his, uncle, fakhruddin, masud, who, held, the, principality, of, bamiyan, as, vassal, of, their, uncle, alauddin, husayn, later, fakhr, al, din, masud, laid, his, own, claim, for, the, succession, after, sayf, al, din, death, as, the, elder, member, of, the, ghurid, family, muhammad, helped, his, brother, in, suppressing, the, revolt, of, fakhruddin, who, garnered, a, sizeable, army, in, alliance, with, the, chiefs, of, balkh, and, herat, who, both, were, executed, in, the, battle, although, fakhruddin, was, reinstated, in, bamiyan, in, 1163, afterwards, with, the, support, of, the, remaining, local, ghurid, officers, and, maliks, his, brother, succeeded, sayf, al, din, to, the, throne, in, 1163, and, initially, placed, muhammad, as, a, minor, officer, in, his, court, which, result, in, him, retiring, unhappy, with, his, position, to, the, court, of, sistan, where, he, spend, a, whole, season, however, later, ghiyath, al, din, sent, an, envoy, to, brought, him, back, who, subsequently, placed, him, in, charge, of, the, southern, part, of, the, ghurid, domains, which, possibly, included, istiyan, and, kajuran, during, the, early, campaigns, of, muhammad, as, a, prince, he, was, instructed, to, subdue, the, oghuz, tribes, whose, power, and, influence, began, to, wane, although, they, were, still, controlling, extensive, territories, he, used, qandhar, as, a, base, and, raided, the, principality, of, oghuzs, multiple, times, before, defeating, them, decisively, along, with, ghiyath, al, din, and, followed, up, their, victory, by, conquering, ghazni, in, 1169, along, with, some, other, territories, in, what, is, present, day, eastern, afghanistan, soon, muhammad, s, coronation, took, place, in, ghazni, in, 1173, and, his, brother, returned, to, firuzkuh, for, the, westwards, expansion, in, transoxania, subsequently, muhammad, utilized, the, city, of, ghazni, as, a, launch, pad, to, led, a, series, of, lucrative, forays, down, to, the, indus, delta, and, beyond, in, 1174, muhammad, led, an, expedition, against, the, ghuzzs, of, sanquran, in, present, day, turkmenistan, and, subdued, them, in, 1175, muhammad, marched, from, ghazni, and, helped, his, brother, in, the, annexation, of, the, cosmopolitan, city, of, herat, and, pushang, after, defeating, a, former, general, of, the, seljuks, the, ghurid, siblings, advanced, into, the, present, day, iran, and, brought, nasrid, dynasty, of, sistan, under, their, sway, whose, ruler, taj, al, din, iii, harb, ibn, muhammad, ibn, nasr, acknowledged, the, ghurid, suzerainty, and, later, sent, his, armies, several, times, assisting, the, ghurids, in, their, warfares, afterwards, ghiyath, al, din, captured, balkh, and, territories, adjoining, herat, in, khurasan, after, the, death, of, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, the, senior, partner, in, the, dyarchy, muhammad, assumed, the, title, of, al, sultan, al, azam, which, meant, the, greatest, sultan, on, one, of, colonnade, in, the, qutb, minar, along, with, some, of, his, golden, mints, circulated, in, india, muhammad, is, eulogized, as, the, sikander, al, thani, second, alexander, muhammad, s, courtier, rhetorically, aggrandize, him, as, the, champion, of, islam, styling, him, as, the, sultan, i, ghazi, sultan, of, the, holy, warriors, portraying, his, indian, expeditions, as, the, engagement, between, the, army, of, islam, lashkar, i, islam, and, the, army, of, infidels, lashkar, i, kuffar, the, ghurid, brothers, ruling, in, a, dyarchy, with, the, senior, partner, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, engaged, in, a, protracted, duel, with, the, khwarazmians, from, his, capital, firuzkuh, situated, in, west, central, afghanistan, while, muhammad, expanded, the, ghurid, domains, eastwards, into, the, indian, plains, from, his, capital, at, ghazni, the, expeditions, into, the, indian, plains, and, the, plunder, extracted, from, the, sacking, of, lucrative, hindu, temples, in, the, gangetic, plain, gave, muhammad, access, to, a, vast, amount, of, treasure, in, ghazni, which, according, to, chronicler, juzjani, based, on, the, authority, of, muhammad, s, comptroller, included, 60, 000, kg, 1500, mann, of, jewels, muhammad, s, expeditions, in, the, indian, subcontinent, started, against, the, qarmatians, sevener, branch, of, isma, ilis, who, regained, a, foothold, in, multan, soon, after, the, death, of, mahmud, of, ghazni, who, installed, a, sunni, governor, there, muhammad, defeated, the, qarmatian, ruler, khafif, in, 1175, and, annexed, multan, the, defeat, turned, to, be, a, death, blow, for, the, qarmatian, power, in, multan, who, never, regained, their, influence, in, the, region, again, after, the, conquest, of, multan, muhammad, captured, uch, which, was, situated, south, of, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, chenab, and, jhelum, his, campaign, in, uch, is, not, mentioned, in, detail, in, the, near, contemporary, accounts, except, k, mil, fit, t, r, kh, although, the, detail, in, the, text, about, his, expedition, in, uch, is, possibly, blurred, by, a, legend, associated, with, the, bhati, rajputs, nonetheless, firishta, a, later, chronicler, mentioned, the, year, of, uch, conquest, as, 1176, it, was, placed, under, malik, nasiurdin, aitam, until, his, death, in, the, battle, of, andkhud, in, 1204, afterwards, it, was, placed, under, nasiruddin, qabacha, during, the, course, of, his, early, invasions, muhammad, avoided, punjab, and, instead, focused, on, lands, bordering, the, middle, and, lower, course, of, the, indus, therefore, to, outflank, the, ghaznavids, in, punjab, and, to, open, up, an, alternative, route, to, the, northern, india, muhammad, turned, south, towards, present, day, gujarat, in, anhilwara, before, entering, in, anhilwara, he, laid, siege, to, the, fort, of, nadol, around, marwar, and, captured, it, after, a, short, siege, from, kelhanadeva, along, with, sacking, the, shiva, temple, in, kiradu, after, marching, through, the, dry, thar, desert, south, of, marwar, the, ghurid, army, got, exhausted, when, they, reached, mount, abu, where, they, were, routed, in, the, mountainous, pass, of, gadararaghatta, by, the, solanki, ruler, mularaja, ii, who, was, also, aided, by, other, rajput, chiefs, mainly, the, naddula, chahamana, ruler, kelhanadeva, who, was, earlier, deposed, by, from, nadol, by, muhammad, the, jalor, chahamana, ruler, kirtipala, and, the, arbuda, paramara, ruler, dharavarsha, the, ghurid, army, suffered, heavy, casualties, during, the, battle, and, also, in, the, retreat, back, across, the, desert, to, ghazni, the, defeat, forced, muhammad, to, opt, for, the, northern, routes, who, thenceforth, concentrated, on, creating, a, suitable, base, in, punjab, and, northwest, for, further, incursions, into, northern, india, in, 1179, muhammad, conquered, peshawar, which, was, possibly, ruled, by, the, ghaznavids, thereafter, he, advanced, further, and, besieged, lahore, in, 1181, although, khusrau, malik, managed, to, keep, him, around, the, borders, of, lahore, for, few, more, years, by, sending, tributes, along, with, one, of, the, ghaznavid, prince, malik, shah, under, his, custody, in, ghazni, as, a, hostage, in, 1182, muhammad, followed, a, southerly, arc, to, the, port, city, of, debal, on, the, arabian, sea, coast, of, sindh, subjugating, the, soomras, in, the, subsequent, years, he, expanded, and, consolidated, his, conquests, around, present, day, pakistan, and, annexed, sialkot, along, with, sacking, lahore, and, the, countryside, after, khusrau, malik, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, dislodge, the, ghurid, garrison, in, sialkot, muhammad, made, the, final, assault, on, lahore, and, forced, him, to, surrender, after, a, short, siege, he, imprisoned, khusrau, malik, in, the, fort, of, gharchistan, breaching, his, own, agreement, of, safe, conduct, for, his, presence, khusrau, malik, was, sent, to, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, in, firuzkuh, where, he, and, all, his, kinfolks, were, executed, before, 1192, thus, ended, the, lineage, of, ghaznavids, and, their, historic, struggle, with, the, ghurids, after, uprooting, the, ghaznavids, muhammad, now, established, his, sway, over, the, strategic, indus, basin, including, most, of, the, punjab, he, appointed, mulla, sirajuddin, who, was, earlier, a, high, ranking, q, i, in, his, father, court, as, the, head, of, judicature, department, in, the, newly, conquered, ghaznavid, territories, along, with, the, charge, of, multan, his, son, minhaj, al, siraj, juzjani, born, 1193, later, composed, the, tabaqat, i, nasiri, in, 1260, which, is, regarded, as, a, monumental, work, from, the, medieval, period, on, the, ghurid, dynasty, and, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1190, after, consildating, in, sindh, and, western, punjab, the, ghurid, generals, began, to, raid, the, eastern, punjab, region, and, captured, a, castle, bathinda, in, present, day, punjab, state, on, the, northwestern, frontier, of, prithviraj, chauhan, s, kingdom, after, appointing, a, qazi, zia, ud, din, of, tulak, as, governor, of, the, fortress, with, 1200, horsemen, muhammad, received, the, news, that, prithviraj, s, army, led, by, his, vassal, prince, govind, rai, were, on, their, way, to, besiege, the, fortress, the, two, armies, eventually, met, near, the, town, of, tarain, 14, miles, from, thanesar, in, present, day, haryana, the, battle, was, marked, by, the, initial, attack, of, mounted, mamluk, archers, to, which, prithviraj, responded, by, counter, attacking, from, three, sides, and, thus, dominating, the, battle, muhammad, mortally, wounded, govind, rai, in, personal, combat, and, in, the, process, was, himself, wounded, whereupon, his, army, retreated, and, prithv, r, j, s, army, was, deemed, victorious, according, to, juzjani, muhammad, was, carried, away, from, the, battleground, in, wounded, state, by, a, khalji, horsemen, a, largely, different, account, from, za, inul, masir, claimed, that, muhammad, after, being, wounded, in, combat, with, govindraja, fell, unconscious, and, his, forces, withdrew, in, disarray, after, assuming, him, to, be, dead, later, a, remnant, of, his, soldiers, arrived, in, the, night, and, searched, for, his, body, at, the, battlesite, muhammad, in, extremely, critical, situation, recognised, his, soldiers, who, rejoiced, after, finding, him, alive, and, took, him, from, the, battlefield, in, a, litter, to, ghazni, however, the, version, from, za, inul, masir, is, not, corroborated, by, any, other, contemporary, and, later, writers, which, made, its, authenticity, dubious, and, the, version, of, juzjani, more, credible, the, ghurid, garrison, of, tabarhind, under, ziauddin, held, out, for, thirteen, months, before, being, capitulated, the, rajputs, could, not, make, quick, progressions, during, the, siege, due, to, absence, of, siege, engines, on, their, part, which, strengthened, the, position, of, muhammad, during, these, months, to, raise, a, formidable, army, after, the, defeat, in, tarain, muhammad, meted, out, severe, punishments, to, the, ghurid, khalji, and, afghan, emirs, who, fled, during, the, battle, the, wallets, filled, with, grains, were, tied, around, their, necks, and, under, this, condition, they, were, paraded, through, ghazni, those, who, refused, were, beheaded, the, late, medieval, historian, ferishta, further, states, on, the, testimony, of, folklore, in, ghazni, that, muhammad, vowed, not, to, visit, his, royal, harem, and, heal, his, wounds, sustained, in, the, battle, till, he, avenged, the, humiliation, of, his, defeat, husain, kharmil, a, prominent, iranian, general, of, the, ghurids, was, called, from, ghazni, with, a, large, contingent, along, with, other, seasoned, warlords, like, mukalba, kharbak, and, illah, muhammad, made, necessary, arrangements, to, counter, the, elephant, phalanx, of, the, rajput, forces, by, having, them, attack, mock, elephants, made, of, mud, and, wood, the, near, contemporary, chroniclers, juzjani, and, isami, stated, that, muhammad, brought, 120, 000, 130, 000, fully, armoured, men, to, the, battle, in, 1192, ferishta, placed, the, strength, of, rajput, army, in, the, decisive, battle, at, 3, 000, elephants, 300, 000, cavalry, and, infantry, most, likely, a, gross, exaggeration, prithviraj, chauhan, had, called, his, banners, but, hoped, to, buy, time, as, his, banners, other, rajputs, under, him, or, his, allies, had, not, arrived, instead, of, engaging, in, direct, confrontation, as, they, did, in, the, initial, battle, of, tarain, the, ghurids, adopted, a, strategy, of, deceit, and, diplomacy, to, overcome, the, rajputs, as, documented, in, taj, ul, ma, asir, by, hasan, nizami, upon, ghori, s, arrival, on, the, battlefield, prithviraj, the, rajput, leader, purportedly, sent, a, formal, message, suggesting, a, peaceful, resolution, stating, it, would, be, wise, for, you, to, return, to, your, homeland, and, we, have, no, intention, of, pursuing, you, in, response, ghori, replied, indicating, that, he, had, come, to, face, challenges, on, the, directive, of, his, ruling, sibling, and, proposing, the, dispatch, of, an, envoy, to, negotiate, peace, according, to, accounts, from, hasan, nizami, muhammad, ufi, and, firishta, it, becomes, evident, that, ghori, employed, deception, and, prithviraj, considering, it, a, genuine, truce, accepted, the, proposal, before, the, next, day, the, ghurids, attacked, the, rajput, army, the, assault, occurred, before, sunrise, catching, the, chahamana, army, off, guard, as, they, had, spent, the, night, in, a, state, of, unawareness, although, they, were, able, to, quickly, form, formations, they, suffered, losses, due, to, surprise, attacks, before, sunrise, juzjani, attributed, the, success, of, the, ghurid, army, to, the, 10, 000, elite, mounted, archers, whom, muhammad, stationed, at, a, small, distance, from, the, elephant, phalanx, of, the, rajput, forces, and, which, ultimately, scattered, the, infidel, host, prithviraj, was, captured, during, the, battle, on, the, bank, of, river, saraswati, present, day, sirsa, and, summarily, executed, after, the, victory, muhammad, took, over, much, of, the, chahamana, kingdom, and, sacked, their, capital, ajmer, during, which, several, hindu, temples, were, desecrated, by, the, ghurids, in, ajmer, muhammad, captured, and, placed, strong, garrisons, at, the, strategic, military, stations, of, sirsa, hansi, samana, and, kohram, muhammad, later, installed, prithviraja, s, minor, son, govindaraja, iv, as, his, puppet, ruler, on, condition, of, heavy, tribute, however, later, after, a, revolt, by, his, uncle, hariraja, govindraja, was, forced, to, move, towards, ranthambore, where, he, established, a, new, dynasty, of, the, chahamanas, hariraja, briefly, dislodged, the, ghurid, garrison, from, ajmer, but, was, later, defeated, by, qutb, ud, din, aibak, subsequently, hairaja, immolated, himself, on, a, funeral, pyre, and, the, ghurids, reoccupied, ajmer, and, placed, it, under, a, muslim, governor, soon, after, delhi, was, also, captured, by, muhammad, and, qutb, al, din, aibak, in, 1193, although, in, continuation, with, the, policy, adopted, earlier, in, ajmer, a, puppet, rajput, scion, was, installed, in, delhi, on, tribute, possibly, the, son, of, govindraja, who, died, in, tarain, however, he, was, soon, deposed, on, the, account, of, treason, while, muhammad, continued, to, carry, raids, in, the, north, indian, plain, although, later, he, got, preoccupied, with, the, ghurid, expansion, in, transoxiana, against, the, khwarezmian, empire, as, his, brother, ghiyath, al, din, began, to, have, health, problems, notwithstanding, muhammad, as, per, the, writings, of, fakhr, i, mudabbir, and, minhaj, i, siraj, juzjani, appointed, aibak, as, his, administraitor, of, the, ghurid, domains, in, north, india, after, the, second, battle, of, tarain, his, lieutenants, qutb, ud, din, aibak, bahauddin, tughril, bakhtiyar, khalji, and, yildiz, before, his, assassination, swiftly, raided, the, local, kingdoms, and, expanded, his, empire, in, the, indian, subcontinent, up, to, north, western, parts, of, bengal, in, east, ajmer, and, ranthambore, rajasthan, in, north, and, till, the, borders, of, ujjain, in, south, after, aibak, consolidated, the, ghurid, rule, in, and, around, the, delhi, doab, muhammad, himself, returned, to, india, to, further, expand, down, the, ganges, valley, accordingly, in, 1194, he, crossed, the, jamuna, river, with, an, army, of, 50, 000, horsemen, where, he, confronted, the, forces, of, the, rajput, gahadavala, king, jayachandra, in, the, battle, of, chandawar, the, ghurid, army, was, victorious, jayachandra, was, killed, in, the, battle, and, much, of, his, army, was, slaughtered, following, the, battle, the, ghurids, took, the, fort, at, asni, where, they, plundered, the, royal, treasure, of, the, gahadavalas, and, went, on, to, take, the, pilgrimage, city, of, varanasi, which, was, looted, and, a, large, number, of, its, temples, destroyed, the, gahadavala, capital, kanauj, was, annexed, in, 1198, during, this, campaign, the, buddhist, city, of, sarnath, was, also, sacked, muhammad, returned, to, the, indian, frontier, again, around, 1196, to, consolidate, his, hold, around, the, present, day, rajasthan, the, territory, of, bayana, at, the, time, was, under, the, control, of, a, sect, of, jadaun, rajputs, muhammad, along, with, aibak, advanced, and, besieged, thankar, whose, ruler, kumarpal, was, defeated, muhammad, placed, the, fort, under, his, senior, slave, bahauddin, tughril, who, later, established, sultankot, and, used, it, as, his, stronghold, after, the, conquest, of, thankar, bahaurddin, turghil, reduced, the, fort, of, gwalior, whose, parihar, chief, sallakhanapala, surrendered, after, a, long, siege, and, accepted, the, ghurid, suzerainty, after, the, assassination, of, muhammad, tourghil, styled, himself, as, the, sultan, in, bayana, in, 1197, qutb, ud, din, aibak, invaded, gujarat, and, defeated, bhima, ii, in, sirohi, after, a, sudden, attack, and, afterwards, sacked, his, capital, anhilwara, thus, aibak, avenged, the, rout, of, muhammad, at, the, same, place, in, 1178, muhammad, continued, to, aid, his, brother, for, the, expansion, in, west, against, the, khwarezmians, in, the, interlude, of, his, eastwards, expansion, meanwhile, in, the, affairs, of, khurasan, sultan, shah, was, defeated, by, his, brother, ala, al, din, tekish, in, alliance, with, the, qara, khitai, troops, and, the, later, succeeded, the, throne, of, khwarezm, in, december, 1172, sultan, shah, fled, to, the, ghurid, brothers, and, asked, for, their, assistance, in, order, to, expel, his, brother, tekish, while, they, received, him, well, they, refused, to, give, him, military, aid, against, tekish, with, whom, the, ghurids, were, on, good, terms, till, then, sultan, shah, carved, out, his, independent, principality, in, khurasan, and, began, plundering, the, regions, of, ghor, along, with, his, governor, bahauddin, turghil, thus, ghiyath, al, din, asked, for, aid, from, muhammad, who, was, occupied, with, his, indian, expeditions, at, the, time, marched, with, his, army, from, ghazni, the, ghurid, feudatories, shamsuddin, muhammad, of, bamiyan, and, tajuddin, of, herat, joined, them, with, their, respective, contingents, against, the, khwarezmians, the, ghurid, forces, decisively, defeated, sultan, shah, on, the, banks, of, river, murgabh, after, months, of, campaigning, and, executed, their, governor, of, herat, bahauddin, turghil, while, sultan, shah, fled, to, merv, the, ghurids, followed, their, victory, by, recapturing, herat, sultan, shah, died, after, a, year, in, 1191, possibly, due, to, the, drug, overdose, according, to, historian, a, b, m, habibullah, the, ghurids, could, not, annex, any, territory, in, khurasan, outside, herat, which, remained, under, the, sway, of, tekesh, and, who, by, 1193, captured, much, of, the, persia, along, with, the, trans, caspian, belt, conversely, c, e, bosworth, stated, that, ghurids, annexed, some, part, of, khurasan, after, their, victory, in, merv, tekish, died, in, 1200, which, led, to, a, brief, period, of, struggle, for, the, succession, between, alauddin, shah, of, khwarezm, and, his, nephew, hindu, khan, the, ghurid, siblings, seized, the, opportunity, and, amidst, the, turmoil, in, the, khwarezmian, house, for, succession, muhammad, and, ghiyath, al, din, invaded, and, captured, the, oasis, cities, of, nishapur, merv, and, tus, and, reached, as, far, as, gorgan, the, ghurids, thus, for, a, short, span, established, their, sway, over, most, of, the, khurasan, for, first, time, in, their, history, however, their, success, turned, to, be, a, short, term, affair, as, alauddin, succeeded, the, throne, in, august, 1200, and, soon, after, recaptured, his, lost, territories, by, 1201, despite, the, success, against, the, ghurids, alauddin, sent, an, envoy, for, diplomacy, to, muhammad, probably, in, order, to, focus, solely, on, overcoming, from, the, suzerainty, of, qara, khitais, by, sougthing, peace, with, the, ghurids, however, the, attempt, turned, to, be, futile, and, muhammad, marched, again, with, his, forces, on, nishapur, which, forced, alauddin, to, shut, himself, inside, the, city, walls, muhammad, recaptured, tus, along, with, herat, and, sacked, the, country, side, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, around, this, time, died, at, herat, on, 13, march, 1203, after, months, of, illness, which, briefly, diverted, muhammad, s, attention, from, the, existing, state, of, affairs, thus, taking, advantage, of, his, absence, from, herat, where, he, appointed, his, nephew, alp, ghazi, khwarezmian, forces, captured, merv, and, beheaded, the, ghurid, governor, karang, there, muhammad, of, ghor, possibly, to, take, over, the, entire, khwarezmian, empire, laid, siege, to, their, capital, gurganj, instead, of, herat, which, was, besieged, by, the, khwarezmians, after, ghiyath, al, din, s, death, alauddin, retreated, on, the, ghurid, advance, and, desperately, requested, aid, from, the, qara, khitais, who, sent, a, sizeable, army, to, aid, the, khwarezmians, muhammad, because, of, the, pressure, from, the, qara, khitai, forces, was, forced, to, relieve, the, siege, and, retreat, however, he, was, chased, on, his, way, to, firuzkuh, and, was, decisively, defeated, in, the, battle, of, andkhud, in, 1204, by, the, combined, forces, of, qara, khitai, and, kara, khanid, khanate, under, taniku, and, uthman, ibn, ibrahim, he, was, allowed, to, return, to, his, capital, after, paying, a, heavy, ransom, to, the, qara, khitai, general, taniku, tayangu, which, included, several, elephants, and, gold, coins, according, to, juzjani, the, negotiations, between, muhammad, and, taniku, were, arranged, by, uthman, ibn, ibrahim, of, samarkand, who, do, not, want, the, sultan, of, islam, to, be, captured, by, the, infidels, following, the, defeat, the, ghurids, lost, the, control, over, most, of, the, khurasan, except, herat, and, balkh, thus, muhammad, of, necessity, agreed, for, a, cold, peace, with, the, khwarezmians, after, the, disaster, of, andkhud, and, the, subsequent, rumours, of, muhammad, s, death, in, the, battle, led, to, widespread, insurrections, throughout, the, ghurid, sultanate, most, notably, by, aibak, beg, husain, kharmil, and, by, the, governor, of, ghazni, yildiz, as, well, muhammad, first, marched, to, multan, instead, of, ghazni, where, his, slave, general, aibak, beg, who, rescued, him, in, battle, of, andkhud, assassinated, the, ghurid, governor, amir, dad, hasan, in, a, personal, meeting, and, issued, a, fake, decree, of, him, being, appointed, by, muhammad, as, the, new, governor, of, multan, muhammad, defeated, aibak, beg, decisively, and, captured, him, in, the, battle, afterwards, he, marched, towards, ghazni, where, yildiz, mutinied, earlier, and, seized, the, city, on, the, advance, of, a, vast, army, of, muhammad, of, ghor, foreseeing, an, inevitable, defeat, yildiz, and, his, aristocrats, surrendered, to, muhammad, who, pardoned, them, thus, muhammad, successfully, restored, his, empire, to, stability, after, suppressing, the, mutineers, and, turned, his, attention, towards, the, affairs, of, central, asia, again, to, avenge, the, rout, at, andhkhud, and, to, reclaim, his, holdings, in, khurasan, accordingly, by, july, 1205, muhammad, s, governor, of, balkh, besieged, tirmidh, in, the, present, day, uzbekistan, and, captured, the, city, following, a, short, siege, destroying, the, qara, khitai, garrison, stationed, there, and, placed, it, under, his, son, afterwards, muhammad, ordered, his, viceory, in, the, bamiyan, valley, baha, al, din, sam, ii, to, construct, a, boat, bridge, and, a, castle, across, the, river, oxus, to, facilitate, the, march, of, his, armies, in, transoxiana, muhammad, also, directed, his, indian, soldiers, to, join, him, in, the, expedition, against, the, qara, khitais, however, soon, another, political, unrest, broke, out, which, turned, muhammad, towards, punjab, again, where, he, was, eventually, assassinated, the, khokhar, tribe, whose, influence, extended, from, the, lower, indus, until, siwalik, hills, arose, in, the, wake, of, muhammad, s, rout, in, the, battle, of, andkhud, and, rebelled, by, disrupting, the, ghurid, communication, chain, between, lahore, and, ghazni, along, with, plundering, lahore, according, to, juzjani, the, khokhars, were, hostile, to, muslims, and, use, to, torment, every, musalman, they, captured, hence, muhammad, marched, from, ghazni, in, december, 1205, for, his, last, campaign, in, order, to, subjugate, the, khokhars, the, khokhars, led, by, bakan, and, sarkha, offered, a, battle, somewhere, between, the, chenab, and, jhelum, rivers, and, fought, valiantly, until, the, afternoon, but, muhammad, carried, the, day, after, iltutmish, arrived, with, a, reserve, contingent, whom, muhammad, earlier, stationed, on, the, banks, of, jhelum, muhammad, followed, his, victory, by, a, large, scale, slaughter, of, the, khokhars, his, armies, also, burnt, down, the, forests, where, many, of, them, took, refuge, while, fleeing, iltutmish, was, rewarded, for, his, gallantry, against, the, khokhars, with, a, presentation, of, special, robe, of, honour, from, muhammad, according, to, juzjani, muhammad, also, manumitted, illtutmish, despite, the, fact, that, his, master, aibak, who, purchased, him, originally, was, still, a, slave, along, with, other, senior, slaves, of, muhammad, who, were, not, manumitted, until, that, point, after, crushing, the, khokhars, on, his, way, back, to, his, capital, in, ghazni, muhammad, s, caravan, rested, at, dhamiak, near, sohawa, which, is, near, the, city, of, jhelum, in, the, punjab, province, of, modern, day, pakistan, where, he, was, assassinated, on, march, 15, 1206, by, the, ism, l, emissaries, the, martyrdom, of, the, sovereign, of, sea, and, land, muizz, ud, din, from, the, beginning, of, the, world, the, like, of, whom, no, monarch, arose, on, the, third, of, the, month, sha, ban, in, the, year, six, hundred, and, two, happened, on, the, road, to, ghazni, at, the, halting, place, of, damyak, according, to, some, sketchy, accounts, regarding, the, identity, of, muhammad, s, assassins, claimed, that, the, assassins, were, sent, by, muhammad, ii, of, khwarezm, however, the, khwarezmians, already, curbed, the, ghurid, ambition, in, transoxiana, after, the, andkhud, debacle, and, were, not, facing, any, potential, danger, from, them, hence, historian, mohammad, habib, theorizes, that, this, speculation, that, the, ismaili, assassins, were, sent, by, the, khwarezmian, shah, is, unlikely, to, be, correct, muhammad, s, assassins, were, probably, sent, by, the, imam, of, alamut, whose, castle, he, sacked, during, the, khurasan, expedition, some, later, accounts, possibly, with, the, genesis, in, the, writing, of, ferishta, claimed, that, his, assassins, were, hindu, khokhars, in, tarikh, i, firishta, he, stated, that, twenty, khokhar, infidels, who, were, cowed, down, by, him, earlier, attacked, his, carvan, and, stabbed, him, with, a, dagger, however, this, account, is, not, corroborated, by, the, earlier, authorities, minhaj, al, siraj, juzjani, hasan, nizami, and, shams, ad, d, n, adh, dhahabi, all, contemporary, or, near, contemporary, accounts, confirmed, that, muhammad, was, assassinated, by, a, heretic, devote, fida, i, mulahida, the, story, of, his, assassination, by, the, khokhars, is, probably, an, invention, of, later, times, based, on, indirect, evidences, muhammad, s, coffin, was, carried, from, dhamiak, to, ghazni, by, his, vizier, moidul, mulk, along, with, other, elites, where, he, was, buried, ghazni, in, the, mausoleum, of, his, daughter, despite, the, debacle, of, andhkhud, and, the, successive, plummet, of, their, western, frontier, muhammad, s, empire, at, the, time, of, his, assassination, still, spread, out, as, far, as, herat, in, the, west, zamindawar, valley, in, the, south, and, the, yasin, valley, in, the, north, east, muhammad, s, only, offspring, was, his, daughter, who, died, during, his, own, lifetime, his, sudden, assassination, in, damyak, led, to, a, period, of, struggle, among, his, slaves, and, other, senior, ghurid, elites, for, the, succession, the, ghurid, aristocrats, of, ghazni, and, f, r, zk, h, supported, the, succession, of, baha, al, din, sam, ii, from, the, bamiyan, branch, although, his, turkic, slaves, supported, ghiyath, al, din, mahmud, who, was, his, nephew, and, son, of, his, brother, ghiyath, al, din, nonetheless, baha, al, din, died, on, his, march, to, ghazni, on, 24, february, 1206, due, to, illness, thus, muhammad, was, succeeded, by, ghiyath, al, din, mahmud, in, 1206, although, most, of, his, conquests, in, the, ganga, valley, were, in, the, grasp, of, his, lieutenants, qutb, ud, din, aibak, taj, al, din, yildiz, bahauddin, tughril, nasir, ad, din, qabacha, and, muhammad, bakhtiyar, khilji, who, barely, consulted, ghiyath, al, din, mahmud, in, their, affairs, notwithstanding, they, still, paid, him, a, minimal, tribute, during, his, reign, mahmud, also, officially, grant, manumission, on, aibak, and, yildiz, thus, freed, from, the, slavery, and, with, investment, of, a, chatr, from, mahmud, yildiz, established, himself, as, the, king, of, ghazni, in, 1206, and, aibak, in, lahore, who, declared, independence, in, 1208, established, the, delhi, sultanate, historian, iqtidar, alam, khan, though, doubted, that, aibak, styled, himself, as, the, sultan, as, it, is, not, attested, by, the, numismatic, evidences, soon, mahmud, was, enforced, to, accept, suzerainty, of, alauddin, shah, of, khawarazm, as, attested, by, the, numismatic, evidences, in, which, he, minted, his, name, along, with, placing, alauddin, s, name, in, the, khu, bah, until, his, assassination, in, 1212, afterwards, the, khwarazmians, established, their, puppet, government, in, the, ghurid, lands, although, yildiz, drove, them, back, in, 1213, before, alauddin, eradicated, the, ghurids, and, annexed, f, r, zk, h, from, zia, al, din, ali, in, 1215, who, either, died, as, his, captive, burned, in, iran, or, retired, to, delhi, in, exile, alauddin, also, defeated, and, executed, the, last, ghurid, ruler, jalal, al, din, ali, from, the, bamiyan, line, in, the, same, year, thus, the, ansab, n, house, was, extirpated, by, 1215, yildiz, was, toppled, from, ghazni, around, the, same, time, as, well, who, later, fled, to, delhi, and, laid, his, own, claim, for, succession, of, the, ghurid, conquests, of, muhammad, of, ghor, however, he, was, defeated, and, executed, in, 1216, by, iltutmish, in, tarain, according, to, juzjani, s, tabaqat, i, nasiri, c, 1260, muhammad, enthusiastically, used, to, purchase, several, slaves, during, his, lifetime, who, later, according, to, juzjani, became, renowned, for, their, calibre, in, east, muhammad, purchased, a, young, qabacha, who, was, sold, into, slavery, and, was, later, bestowed, with, the, domains, of, kerman, and, sanjar, for, his, iq, by, the, ghurid, sultan, he, raised, his, slaves, with, affection, and, treated, them, as, his, sons, and, successors, after, his, despondency, with, his, own, ghurid, household, in, his, later, days, according, to, another, contemporary, account, of, fakhr, i, mudabbir, who, wrote, under, the, patronage, of, qutb, ud, din, aibak, also, emphasized, upon, the, importance, of, each, of, the, turkish, slaves, bandagan, to, muhammad, he, further, panegyrise, aibak, for, enduring, the, trust, of, his, master, muhammad, s, slaves, played, a, key, role, in, the, expansion, and, consolidation, of, the, ghurid, conquests, in, the, ganga, jamuna, doab, when, he, was, engaged, in, the, affairs, of, khurasan, and, amidst, this, also, raised, their, own, authority, in, the, north, india, while, still, regarding, muhammad, as, their, supreme, master, until, his, assassination, muhammad, later, also, organized, matrimonial, alliances, among, the, families, of, his, slaves, in, accordance, with, the, practise, of, endogamy, the, notable, among, these, alliances, were, the, marriages, of, the, daughters, of, taj, al, din, yildiz, to, qutb, ud, din, aibak, and, nasir, ad, din, qabacha, further, two, daughters, of, aibak, were, married, to, qabacha, this, policy, was, continued, by, aibak, as, well, who, married, his, daughter, to, his, slave, illtutmish, in, popular, traditions, when, a, courtier, lamented, that, the, sultan, muhammad, had, no, male, heirs, he, retorted, other, monarchs, may, have, one, son, or, two, sons, i, have, thousands, of, sons, my, turkish, slaves, who, will, be, the, heirs, of, my, dominions, and, who, after, me, will, take, care, to, preserve, my, name, in, the, khu, bah, friday, sermon, throughout, these, territories, during, the, dyarchy, of, muhammad, and, his, elder, brother, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, the, ghurids, emerged, as, one, of, the, major, powers, in, the, eastern, islamic, world, the, ghurids, reached, the, greatest, extent, of, their, territorial, expansion, where, they, briefly, ruled, over, a, territory, which, spanned, over, 3000, km, from, east, to, west, during, these, years, their, empire, stretched, from, gorgan, in, eastern, present, day, iran, to, lakhnauti, in, present, day, bangladesh, and, from, the, foothills, of, the, himalaya, south, to, sindh, pakistan, the, catastrophe, of, andkhud, and, the, collapse, of, the, ansab, n, dynasty, within, a, decade, of, his, assassination, along, with, the, rise, of, genghis, khan, who, carved, out, the, largest, contiguous, empire, in, history, made, his, short, lived, successes, in, the, khurasan, and, persia, as, less, consequential, in, contrast, to, the, more, substantial, islamic, monarchs, of, central, asia, while, muhammad, was, not, much, successful, against, his, turkish, adversaries, in, the, transoxiana, notwithstanding, his, success, in, the, indian, subcontinent, had, far, flug, consequences, the, 13th, century, chronicle, jawami, ul, hikayat, by, muhammad, aufi, mentioned, that, the, sultan, muhammad, of, ghor, khu, bah, was, read, in, all, the, mosques, from, herat, to, assam, his, decisive, victory, in, the, second, battle, of, tarain, against, the, rajput, forces, of, prithviraja, iii, laid, to, the, establishment, of, the, delhi, sultanate, by, qutb, ud, din, aibak, which, was, further, consolidated, by, his, slave, commander, illtutmish, in, the, ensuring, times, the, sultanate, of, delhi, turned, to, be, the, only, major, islamic, state, that, survived, amongst, the, carnage, in, the, central, asia, caused, by, the, mongols, during, the, thirteenth, century, the, ghurids, similar, to, the, ghaznavids, were, unpopular, among, their, subjects, of, the, khurasan, according, to, juzjani, muhammad, imposed, heavy, taxes, plundered, and, seized, the, property, in, tus, for, the, expanses, of, his, army, which, was, committed, for, the, protection, of, a, imam, s, shrine, these, events, eventually, turned, the, people, belligerent, towards, the, ghurids, who, retaliated, when, muhammad, besieged, gurganz, and, militarily, supported, the, besieged, khwarezmian, shah, who, as, a, result, collected, a, hughe, army, of, 70, 000, which, eventually, forced, muhammad, to, relieve, the, siege, and, retreat, before, being, cornered, by, the, qara, khitai, forces, the, ghor, region, however, during, his, reign, did, prospered, and, became, a, leading, centre, of, learning, and, culture, he, also, gave, grants, to, various, theologians, like, maulana, fakharudin, razi, who, preached, the, islamic, teachings, in, the, backward, regions, of, the, ghurid, empire, muhammad, also, briefly, contributed, in, the, archietectural, aspect, of, his, region, chiefly, constructing, distinctive, kind, of, islamic, glazed, tiles, in, his, capital, ghazni, the, circulation, of, coins, from, muhammad, s, court, in, ghazni, around, 1199, confirming, to, the, numismatic, standards, of, the, islamic, world, carried, only, arabic, calligraphy, with, the, qalma, and, name, of, his, sibling, ghiyath, al, din, muhammad, along, with, his, title, on, the, obverse, side, of, coin, whereas, the, reverse, side, of, coin, featured, muhammad, s, name, and, his, title, along, with, the, title, of, caliphate, the, paradigm, of, coins, issued, by, muhammad, and, ghiyath, al, din, shifted, drastically, from, 1199, onwards, to, a, further, more, orthodox, ideologue, with, the, quranic, verses, on, both, sides, the, radical, shift, to, orthodoxy, in, the, coinage, is, probably, to, propound, their, recent, change, of, school, from, karramiyya, to, the, mainstream, hanafi, and, shafi, i, schools, of, islam, by, ghiyath, al, din, and, muhammad, respectively, in, order, to, embed, themselves, within, cosmopolitan, networks, of, the, wider, islamic, world, and, shed, off, their, backward, origin, the, coins, issued, by, muhammad, in, northern, india, followed, the, indian, standards, of, weight, and, metallic, purity, the, ghurid, coins, in, india, except, bengal, continued, on, the, same, paradigm, of, pre, conquest, with, the, existing, hindu, iconography, juxtaposed, with, the, name, of, muhammad, written, in, sanskrit, the, language, of, northern, indian, literate, elites, and, not, in, the, arabic, coins, minted, by, muhammad, and, his, lieutenants, in, north, india, continued, featuring, the, iconographic, programme, of, hindu, deity, lakshmi, based, on, the, existing, pattern, of, chahamanas, on, one, side, and, muhammad, s, name, in, the, n, gar, script, on, other, side, written, in, sanskrit, similarly, in, delhi, the, ghurid, circulation, continued, on, the, pre, conquest, paradigm, which, had, the, iconography, of, nandi, bull, and, a, chahaman, horsemen, juxtaposed, with, muhammad, s, name, written, as, shri, hammirah, finbarr, barry, flood, commented, on, the, notion, of, continuity, of, the, pre, conquest, arrangements, in, the, numismatics, as, a, pragmatic, measure, of, ghurids, to, met, the, economic, realities, in, northern, india, sunil, kumar, further, elaborated, on, the, basis, of, hoard, evidences, that, the, coins, issued, by, muhammad, were, accepted, on, the, same, scale, by, the, local, indian, financiers, and, bankers, as, the, previous, coins, which, were, issued, by, the, rajputs, despite, a, period, of, transition, regime, change, in, the, political, milieu, of, northern, india, in, the, 2022, film, samrat, prithviraj, manav, vij, portrayed, muhammad, of, ghor
