augusta, ada, king, countess, of, lovelace, n, e, byron, 10, december, 1815, 27, november, 1852, also, known, as, ada, lovelace, was, an, english, mathematician, and, writer, chiefly, known, for, her, work, on, charles, babbage, s, proposed, mechanical, general, purpose, computer, the, analytical, engine, she, was, the, first, to, recognise, that, the, machine, had, applications, beyond, pure, calculation, lovelace, was, the, only, legitimate, child, of, poet, lord, byron, and, reformer, anne, isabella, milbanke, all, her, half, siblings, lord, byron, s, other, children, were, born, out, of, wedlock, to, other, women, lord, byron, separated, from, his, wife, a, month, after, ada, was, born, and, left, england, forever, he, died, in, greece, when, she, was, eight, lady, byron, was, anxious, about, her, daughter, s, upbringing, and, promoted, lovelace, s, interest, in, mathematics, and, logic, in, an, effort, to, prevent, her, from, developing, her, father, s, perceived, insanity, despite, this, lovelace, remained, interested, in, her, father, naming, her, two, sons, byron, and, gordon, upon, her, death, she, was, buried, next, to, her, father, at, her, request, although, often, ill, in, her, childhood, lovelace, pursued, her, studies, assiduously, she, married, william, king, in, 1835, king, was, made, earl, of, lovelace, in, 1838, ada, thereby, becoming, countess, of, lovelace, lovelace, s, educational, and, social, exploits, brought, her, into, contact, with, scientists, such, as, andrew, crosse, charles, babbage, sir, david, brewster, charles, wheatstone, and, michael, faraday, and, the, author, charles, dickens, contacts, which, she, used, to, further, her, education, lovelace, described, her, approach, as, poetical, science, and, herself, as, an, analyst, metaphysician, when, she, was, eighteen, lovelace, s, mathematical, talents, led, her, to, a, long, working, relationship, and, friendship, with, fellow, british, mathematician, charles, babbage, who, is, known, as, the, father, of, computers, she, was, in, particular, interested, in, babbage, s, work, on, the, analytical, engine, lovelace, first, met, him, on, 5, june, 1833, when, she, and, her, mother, attended, one, of, charles, babbage, s, saturday, night, soir, es, with, their, mutual, friend, and, lovelace, s, private, tutor, mary, somerville, between, 1842, and, 1843, lovelace, translated, an, article, by, the, military, engineer, luigi, menabrea, later, prime, minister, of, italy, about, the, analytical, engine, supplementing, it, with, an, elaborate, set, of, seven, notes, simply, called, notes, lovelace, s, notes, are, important, in, the, early, history, of, computers, especially, since, the, seventh, one, contained, what, many, consider, to, be, the, first, computer, program, that, is, an, algorithm, designed, to, be, carried, out, by, a, machine, other, historians, reject, this, perspective, and, point, out, that, babbage, s, personal, notes, from, 1837, to, 1840, contain, the, first, programs, for, the, engine, she, also, developed, a, vision, of, the, capability, of, computers, to, go, beyond, mere, calculating, or, number, crunching, while, many, others, including, babbage, himself, focused, only, on, those, capabilities, her, mindset, of, poetical, science, led, her, to, ask, questions, about, the, analytical, engine, as, shown, in, her, notes, examining, how, individuals, and, society, relate, to, technology, as, a, collaborative, tool, the, coding, language, ada, is, named, after, her, lord, byron, expected, his, child, to, be, a, glorious, boy, and, was, disappointed, when, lady, byron, gave, birth, to, a, girl, the, child, was, named, after, byron, s, half, sister, augusta, leigh, and, was, called, ada, by, byron, himself, on, 16, january, 1816, at, lord, byron, s, command, lady, byron, left, for, her, parents, home, at, kirkby, mallory, taking, their, five, week, old, daughter, with, her, although, english, law, at, the, time, granted, full, custody, of, children, to, the, father, in, cases, of, separation, lord, byron, made, no, attempt, to, claim, his, parental, rights, but, did, request, that, his, sister, keep, him, informed, of, ada, s, welfare, on, 21, april, lord, byron, signed, the, deed, of, separation, although, very, reluctantly, and, left, england, for, good, a, few, days, later, aside, from, an, acrimonious, separation, lady, byron, continued, throughout, her, life, to, make, allegations, about, her, husband, s, immoral, behaviour, this, set, of, events, made, lovelace, infamous, in, victorian, society, ada, did, not, have, a, relationship, with, her, father, he, died, in, 1824, when, she, was, eight, years, old, her, mother, was, the, only, significant, parental, figure, in, her, life, lovelace, was, not, shown, the, family, portrait, of, her, father, until, her, 20th, birthday, lovelace, did, not, have, a, close, relationship, with, her, mother, she, was, often, left, in, the, care, of, her, maternal, grandmother, judith, hon, lady, milbanke, who, doted, on, her, however, because, of, societal, attitudes, of, the, time, which, favoured, the, husband, in, any, separation, with, the, welfare, of, any, child, acting, as, mitigation, lady, byron, had, to, present, herself, as, a, loving, mother, to, the, rest, of, society, this, included, writing, anxious, letters, to, lady, milbanke, about, her, daughter, s, welfare, with, a, cover, note, saying, to, retain, the, letters, in, case, she, had, to, use, them, to, show, maternal, concern, in, one, letter, to, lady, milbanke, she, referred, to, her, daughter, as, it, i, talk, to, it, for, your, satisfaction, not, my, own, and, shall, be, very, glad, when, you, have, it, under, your, own, lady, byron, had, her, teenage, daughter, watched, by, close, friends, for, any, sign, of, moral, deviation, lovelace, dubbed, these, observers, the, furies, and, later, complained, they, exaggerated, and, invented, stories, about, her, lovelace, was, often, ill, beginning, in, early, childhood, at, the, age, of, eight, she, experienced, headaches, that, obscured, her, vision, in, june, 1829, she, was, paralyzed, after, a, bout, of, measles, she, was, subjected, to, continuous, bed, rest, for, nearly, a, year, something, which, may, have, extended, her, period, of, disability, by, 1831, she, was, able, to, walk, with, crutches, despite, the, illnesses, she, developed, her, mathematical, and, technological, skills, when, ada, was, twelve, years, old, this, future, lady, fairy, as, charles, babbage, affectionately, called, her, decided, she, wanted, to, fly, ada, byron, went, about, the, project, methodically, thoughtfully, with, imagination, and, passion, her, first, step, in, february, 1828, was, to, construct, wings, she, investigated, different, material, and, sizes, she, considered, various, materials, for, the, wings, paper, oilsilk, wires, and, feathers, she, examined, the, anatomy, of, birds, to, determine, the, right, proportion, between, the, wings, and, the, body, she, decided, to, write, a, book, flyology, illustrating, with, plates, some, of, her, findings, she, decided, what, equipment, she, would, need, for, example, a, compass, to, cut, across, the, country, by, the, most, direct, road, so, that, she, could, surmount, mountains, rivers, and, valleys, her, final, step, was, to, integrate, steam, with, the, art, of, flying, ada, byron, had, an, affair, with, a, tutor, in, early, 1833, she, tried, to, elope, with, him, after, she, was, caught, but, the, tutor, s, relatives, recognised, her, and, contacted, her, mother, lady, byron, and, her, friends, covered, the, incident, up, to, prevent, a, public, scandal, lovelace, never, met, her, younger, half, sister, allegra, the, daughter, of, lord, byron, and, claire, clairmont, allegra, died, in, 1822, at, the, age, of, five, lovelace, did, have, some, contact, with, elizabeth, medora, leigh, the, daughter, of, byron, s, half, sister, augusta, leigh, who, purposely, avoided, lovelace, as, much, as, possible, when, introduced, at, court, lovelace, became, close, friends, with, her, tutor, mary, somerville, who, introduced, her, to, charles, babbage, in, 1833, she, had, a, strong, respect, and, affection, for, somerville, and, they, corresponded, for, many, years, other, acquaintances, included, the, scientists, andrew, crosse, sir, david, brewster, charles, wheatstone, michael, faraday, and, the, author, charles, dickens, she, was, presented, at, court, at, the, age, of, seventeen, and, became, a, popular, belle, of, the, season, in, part, because, of, her, brilliant, mind, by, 1834, ada, was, a, regular, at, court, and, started, attending, various, events, she, danced, often, and, was, able, to, charm, many, people, and, was, described, by, most, people, as, being, dainty, although, john, hobhouse, byron, s, friend, described, her, as, a, large, coarse, skinned, young, woman, but, with, something, of, my, friend, s, features, particularly, the, mouth, this, description, followed, their, meeting, on, 24, february, 1834, in, which, ada, made, it, clear, to, hobhouse, that, she, did, not, like, him, probably, due, to, her, mother, s, influence, which, led, her, to, dislike, all, of, her, father, s, friends, this, first, impression, was, not, to, last, and, they, later, became, friends, on, 8, july, 1835, she, married, william, 8th, baron, king, becoming, lady, king, they, had, three, homes, ockham, park, surrey, a, scottish, estate, on, loch, torridon, in, ross, shire, and, a, house, in, london, they, spent, their, honeymoon, at, ashley, combe, near, porlock, weir, somerset, which, had, been, built, as, a, hunting, lodge, in, 1799, and, was, improved, by, king, in, preparation, for, their, honeymoon, it, later, became, their, summer, retreat, and, was, further, improved, during, this, time, from, 1845, the, family, s, main, house, was, horsley, towers, built, in, the, tudorbethan, fashion, by, the, architect, of, the, houses, of, parliament, charles, barry, and, later, greatly, enlarged, to, lovelace, s, own, designs, they, had, three, children, byron, born, 1836, anne, isabella, called, annabella, born, 1837, and, ralph, gordon, born, 1839, immediately, after, the, birth, of, annabella, lady, king, experienced, a, tedious, and, suffering, illness, which, took, months, to, cure, ada, was, a, descendant, of, the, extinct, barons, lovelace, and, in, 1838, her, husband, was, made, earl, of, lovelace, and, viscount, ockham, meaning, ada, became, the, countess, of, lovelace, in, 1843, 44, ada, s, mother, assigned, william, benjamin, carpenter, to, teach, ada, s, children, and, to, act, as, a, moral, instructor, for, ada, he, quickly, fell, for, her, and, encouraged, her, to, express, any, frustrated, affections, claiming, that, his, marriage, meant, he, would, never, act, in, an, unbecoming, manner, when, it, became, clear, that, carpenter, was, trying, to, start, an, affair, ada, cut, it, off, in, 1841, lovelace, and, medora, leigh, the, daughter, of, lord, byron, s, half, sister, augusta, leigh, were, told, by, ada, s, mother, that, ada, s, father, was, also, medora, s, father, on, 27, february, 1841, ada, wrote, to, her, mother, i, am, not, in, the, least, astonished, in, fact, you, merely, confirm, what, i, have, for, years, and, years, felt, scarcely, a, doubt, about, but, should, have, considered, it, most, improper, in, me, to, hint, to, you, that, i, in, any, way, suspected, she, did, not, blame, the, incestuous, relationship, on, byron, but, instead, blamed, augusta, leigh, i, fear, she, is, more, inherently, wicked, than, he, ever, was, in, the, 1840s, ada, flirted, with, scandals, firstly, from, a, relaxed, approach, to, extra, marital, relationships, with, men, leading, to, rumours, of, affairs, and, secondly, from, her, love, of, gambling, she, apparently, lost, more, than, 3, 000, on, the, horses, during, the, later, 1840s, the, gambling, led, to, her, forming, a, syndicate, with, male, friends, and, an, ambitious, attempt, in, 1851, to, create, a, mathematical, model, for, successful, large, bets, this, went, disastrously, wrong, leaving, her, thousands, of, pounds, in, debt, to, the, syndicate, forcing, her, to, admit, it, all, to, her, husband, she, had, a, shadowy, relationship, with, andrew, crosse, s, son, john, from, 1844, onwards, john, crosse, destroyed, most, of, their, correspondence, after, her, death, as, part, of, a, legal, agreement, she, bequeathed, him, the, only, heirlooms, her, father, had, personally, left, to, her, during, her, final, illness, she, would, panic, at, the, idea, of, the, younger, crosse, being, kept, from, visiting, her, from, 1832, when, she, was, seventeen, her, mathematical, abilities, began, to, emerge, and, her, interest, in, mathematics, dominated, the, majority, of, her, adult, life, her, mother, s, obsession, with, rooting, out, any, of, the, insanity, of, which, she, accused, byron, was, one, of, the, reasons, that, ada, was, taught, mathematics, from, an, early, age, she, was, privately, educated, in, mathematics, and, science, by, william, frend, william, king, and, mary, somerville, the, noted, 19th, century, researcher, and, scientific, author, in, the, 1840s, the, mathematician, augustus, de, morgan, extended, her, much, help, in, her, mathematical, studies, including, study, of, advanced, calculus, topics, including, the, numbers, of, bernoulli, that, formed, her, celebrated, algorithm, for, babbage, s, analytical, engine, in, a, letter, to, lady, byron, de, morgan, suggested, that, ada, s, skill, in, mathematics, might, lead, her, to, become, an, original, mathematical, investigator, perhaps, of, first, rate, eminence, lovelace, often, questioned, basic, assumptions, through, integrating, poetry, and, science, whilst, studying, differential, calculus, she, wrote, to, de, morgan, i, may, remark, that, the, curious, transformations, many, formulae, can, undergo, the, unsuspected, and, to, a, beginner, apparently, impossible, identity, of, forms, exceedingly, dissimilar, at, first, sight, is, i, think, one, of, the, chief, difficulties, in, the, early, part, of, mathematical, studies, i, am, often, reminded, of, certain, sprites, and, fairies, one, reads, of, who, are, at, one, s, elbows, in, one, shape, now, and, the, next, minute, in, a, form, most, dissimilar, lovelace, believed, that, intuition, and, imagination, were, critical, to, effectively, applying, mathematical, and, scientific, concepts, she, valued, metaphysics, as, much, as, mathematics, viewing, both, as, tools, for, exploring, the, unseen, worlds, around, us, lovelace, died, at, the, age, of, 36, on, 27, november, 1852, from, uterine, cancer, the, illness, lasted, several, months, in, which, time, annabella, took, command, over, whom, ada, saw, and, excluded, all, of, her, friends, and, confidants, under, her, mother, s, influence, ada, had, a, religious, transformation, and, was, coaxed, into, repenting, of, her, previous, conduct, and, making, annabella, her, executor, she, lost, contact, with, her, husband, after, confessing, something, to, him, on, 30, august, which, caused, him, to, abandon, her, bedside, it, is, not, known, what, she, told, him, she, was, buried, at, her, request, next, to, her, father, at, the, church, of, st, mary, magdalene, in, hucknall, nottinghamshire, throughout, her, life, lovelace, was, strongly, interested, in, scientific, developments, and, fads, of, the, day, including, phrenology, and, mesmerism, after, her, work, with, babbage, lovelace, continued, to, work, on, other, projects, in, 1844, she, commented, to, a, friend, woronzow, greig, about, her, desire, to, create, a, mathematical, model, for, how, the, brain, gives, rise, to, thoughts, and, nerves, to, feelings, a, calculus, of, the, nervous, system, she, never, achieved, this, however, in, part, her, interest, in, the, brain, came, from, a, long, running, pre, occupation, inherited, from, her, mother, about, her, potential, madness, as, part, of, her, research, into, this, project, she, visited, the, electrical, engineer, andrew, crosse, in, 1844, to, learn, how, to, carry, out, electrical, experiments, in, the, same, year, she, wrote, a, review, of, a, paper, by, baron, karl, von, reichenbach, researches, on, magnetism, but, this, was, not, published, and, does, not, appear, to, have, progressed, past, the, first, draft, in, 1851, the, year, before, her, cancer, struck, she, wrote, to, her, mother, mentioning, certain, productions, she, was, working, on, regarding, the, relation, of, maths, and, music, lovelace, first, met, charles, babbage, in, june, 1833, through, their, mutual, friend, mary, somerville, later, that, month, babbage, invited, lovelace, to, see, the, prototype, for, his, difference, engine, she, became, fascinated, with, the, machine, and, used, her, relationship, with, somerville, to, visit, babbage, as, often, as, she, could, babbage, was, impressed, by, lovelace, s, intellect, and, analytic, skills, he, called, her, the, enchantress, of, number, in, 1843, he, wrote, to, her, forget, this, world, and, all, its, troubles, and, if, possible, its, multitudinous, charlatans, every, thing, in, short, but, the, enchantress, of, number, during, a, nine, month, period, in, 1842, 43, lovelace, translated, the, italian, mathematician, luigi, menabrea, s, article, on, babbage, s, newest, proposed, machine, the, analytical, engine, with, the, article, she, appended, a, set, of, notes, explaining, the, analytical, engine, s, function, was, a, difficult, task, many, other, scientists, did, not, grasp, the, concept, and, the, british, establishment, had, shown, little, interest, in, it, lovelace, s, notes, even, had, to, explain, how, the, analytical, engine, differed, from, the, original, difference, engine, her, work, was, well, received, at, the, time, the, scientist, michael, faraday, described, himself, as, a, supporter, of, her, writing, the, notes, are, around, three, times, longer, than, the, article, itself, and, include, in, note, g, in, complete, detail, a, method, for, calculating, a, sequence, of, bernoulli, numbers, using, the, analytical, engine, which, might, have, run, correctly, had, it, ever, been, built, only, babbage, s, difference, engine, has, been, built, completed, in, london, in, 2002, based, on, this, work, lovelace, is, now, considered, by, many, to, be, the, first, computer, programmer, and, her, method, has, been, called, the, world, s, first, computer, program, others, dispute, this, because, some, of, charles, babbage, s, earlier, writings, could, be, considered, computer, programs, note, g, also, contains, lovelace, s, dismissal, of, artificial, intelligence, she, wrote, that, the, analytical, engine, has, no, pretensions, whatever, to, originate, anything, it, can, do, whatever, we, know, how, to, order, it, to, perform, it, can, follow, analysis, but, it, has, no, power, of, anticipating, any, analytical, relations, or, truths, this, objection, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, and, rebuttal, for, example, by, alan, turing, in, his, paper, computing, machinery, and, intelligence, most, modern, computer, scientists, argue, that, this, view, is, outdated, and, that, computer, software, can, develop, in, ways, that, cannot, necessarily, be, anticipated, by, programmers, lovelace, and, babbage, had, a, minor, falling, out, when, the, papers, were, published, when, he, tried, to, leave, his, own, statement, criticising, the, government, s, treatment, of, his, engine, as, an, unsigned, preface, which, could, have, been, mistakenly, interpreted, as, a, joint, declaration, when, taylor, s, scientific, memoirs, ruled, that, the, statement, should, be, signed, babbage, wrote, to, lovelace, asking, her, to, withdraw, the, paper, this, was, the, first, that, she, knew, he, was, leaving, it, unsigned, and, she, wrote, back, refusing, to, withdraw, the, paper, the, historian, benjamin, woolley, theorised, that, his, actions, suggested, he, had, so, enthusiastically, sought, ada, s, involvement, and, so, happily, indulged, her, because, of, her, celebrated, name, their, friendship, recovered, and, they, continued, to, correspond, on, 12, august, 1851, when, she, was, dying, of, cancer, lovelace, wrote, to, him, asking, him, to, be, her, executor, though, this, letter, did, not, give, him, the, necessary, legal, authority, part, of, the, terrace, at, worthy, manor, was, known, as, philosopher, s, walk, it, was, there, that, lovelace, and, babbage, were, reputed, to, have, walked, while, discussing, mathematical, principles, in, 1840, babbage, was, invited, to, give, a, seminar, at, the, university, of, turin, about, his, analytical, engine, luigi, menabrea, a, young, italian, engineer, and, the, future, prime, minister, of, italy, transcribed, babbage, s, lecture, into, french, and, this, transcript, was, subsequently, published, in, the, biblioth, que, universelle, de, gen, ve, in, october, 1842, babbage, s, friend, charles, wheatstone, commissioned, ada, lovelace, to, translate, menabrea, s, paper, into, english, she, then, augmented, the, paper, with, notes, which, were, added, to, the, translation, ada, lovelace, spent, the, better, part, of, a, year, doing, this, assisted, with, input, from, babbage, these, notes, which, are, more, extensive, than, menabrea, s, paper, were, then, published, in, the, september, 1843, edition, of, taylor, s, scientific, memoirs, under, the, initialism, aal, ada, lovelace, s, notes, were, labelled, alphabetically, from, a, to, g, in, note, g, she, describes, an, algorithm, for, the, analytical, engine, to, compute, bernoulli, numbers, it, is, considered, to, be, the, first, published, algorithm, ever, specifically, tailored, for, implementation, on, a, computer, and, ada, lovelace, has, often, been, cited, as, the, first, computer, programmer, for, this, reason, the, engine, was, never, completed, and, so, her, program, was, never, tested, in, 1953, more, than, a, century, after, her, death, ada, lovelace, s, notes, on, babbage, s, analytical, engine, were, republished, as, an, appendix, to, b, v, bowden, s, faster, than, thought, a, symposium, on, digital, computing, machines, the, engine, has, now, been, recognised, as, an, early, model, for, a, computer, and, her, notes, as, a, description, of, a, computer, and, software, in, her, notes, ada, lovelace, emphasised, the, difference, between, the, analytical, engine, and, previous, calculating, machines, particularly, its, ability, to, be, programmed, to, solve, problems, of, any, complexity, she, realised, the, potential, of, the, device, extended, far, beyond, mere, number, crunching, in, her, notes, she, wrote, might, act, upon, other, things, besides, number, were, objects, found, whose, mutual, fundamental, relations, could, be, expressed, by, those, of, the, abstract, science, of, operations, and, which, should, be, also, susceptible, of, adaptations, to, the, action, of, the, operating, notation, and, mechanism, of, the, engine, supposing, for, instance, that, the, fundamental, relations, of, pitched, sounds, in, the, science, of, harmony, and, of, musical, composition, were, susceptible, of, such, expression, and, adaptations, the, engine, might, compose, elaborate, and, scientific, pieces, of, music, of, any, degree, of, complexity, or, extent, this, analysis, was, an, important, development, from, previous, ideas, about, the, capabilities, of, computing, devices, and, anticipated, the, implications, of, modern, computing, one, hundred, years, before, they, were, realised, walter, isaacson, ascribes, ada, s, insight, regarding, the, application, of, computing, to, any, process, based, on, logical, symbols, to, an, observation, about, textiles, when, she, saw, some, mechanical, looms, that, used, punchcards, to, direct, the, weaving, of, beautiful, patterns, it, reminded, her, of, how, babbage, s, engine, used, punched, cards, to, make, calculations, this, insight, is, seen, as, significant, by, writers, such, as, betty, toole, and, benjamin, woolley, as, well, as, the, programmer, john, graham, cumming, whose, project, plan, 28, has, the, aim, of, constructing, the, first, complete, analytical, engine, according, to, the, historian, of, computing, and, babbage, specialist, doron, swade, ada, saw, something, that, babbage, in, some, sense, failed, to, see, in, babbage, s, world, his, engines, were, bound, by, number, what, lovelace, saw, was, that, number, could, represent, entities, other, than, quantity, so, once, you, had, a, machine, for, manipulating, numbers, if, those, numbers, represented, other, things, letters, musical, notes, then, the, machine, could, manipulate, symbols, of, which, number, was, one, instance, according, to, rules, it, is, this, fundamental, transition, from, a, machine, which, is, a, number, cruncher, to, a, machine, for, manipulating, symbols, according, to, rules, that, is, the, fundamental, transition, from, calculation, to, computation, to, general, purpose, computation, and, looking, back, from, the, present, high, ground, of, modern, computing, if, we, are, looking, and, sifting, history, for, that, transition, then, that, transition, was, made, explicitly, by, ada, in, that, 1843, paper, lovelace, recognized, the, difference, between, the, details, of, the, computing, mechanism, as, covered, in, an, 1834, article, on, the, difference, engine, and, the, logical, structure, of, the, analytical, engine, on, which, the, article, she, was, reviewing, dwelt, she, noted, that, different, specialists, might, be, required, in, each, area, the, chiefly, treats, it, under, its, mechanical, aspect, entering, but, slightly, into, the, mathematical, principles, of, which, that, engine, is, the, representative, but, giving, in, considerable, length, many, details, of, the, mechanism, and, contrivances, by, means, of, which, it, tabulates, the, various, orders, of, differences, m, menabrea, on, the, contrary, exclusively, developes, the, analytical, view, taking, it, for, granted, that, mechanism, is, able, to, perform, certain, processes, but, without, attempting, to, explain, how, and, devoting, his, whole, attention, to, explanations, and, illustrations, of, the, manner, in, which, analytical, laws, can, be, so, arranged, and, combined, as, to, bring, every, branch, of, that, vast, subject, within, the, grasp, of, the, assumed, powers, of, mechanism, it, is, obvious, that, in, the, invention, of, a, calculating, engine, these, two, branches, of, the, subject, are, equally, essential, fields, of, investigation, they, are, indissolubly, connected, though, so, different, in, their, intrinsic, nature, that, perhaps, the, same, mind, might, not, be, likely, to, prove, equally, profound, or, successful, in, both, note, a, though, lovelace, is, often, referred, to, as, the, first, computer, programmer, some, biographers, computer, scientists, and, historians, of, computing, suggest, otherwise, allan, g, bromley, in, the, 1990, article, difference, and, analytical, engines, all, but, one, of, the, programs, cited, in, her, notes, had, been, prepared, by, babbage, from, three, to, seven, years, earlier, the, exception, was, prepared, by, babbage, for, her, although, she, did, detect, a, bug, in, it, not, only, is, there, no, evidence, that, ada, ever, prepared, a, program, for, the, analytical, engine, but, her, correspondence, with, babbage, shows, that, she, did, not, have, the, knowledge, to, do, so, bruce, collier, wrote, that, lovelace, made, a, considerable, contribution, to, publicizing, the, analytical, engine, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, she, advanced, the, design, or, theory, of, it, in, any, way, eugene, eric, kim, and, betty, alexandra, toole, consider, it, incorrect, to, regard, lovelace, as, the, first, computer, programmer, as, babbage, wrote, the, initial, programs, for, his, analytical, engine, although, the, majority, were, never, published, bromley, notes, several, dozen, sample, programs, prepared, by, babbage, between, 1837, and, 1840, all, substantially, predating, lovelace, s, notes, dorothy, k, stein, regards, lovelace, s, notes, as, more, a, reflection, of, the, mathematical, uncertainty, of, the, author, the, political, purposes, of, the, inventor, and, above, all, of, the, social, and, cultural, context, in, which, it, was, written, than, a, blueprint, for, a, scientific, development, doron, swade, has, said, that, ada, only, published, the, first, computer, program, instead, of, actually, writing, it, but, agrees, that, she, was, the, only, person, to, see, the, potential, of, the, analytical, engine, as, a, machine, capable, of, expressing, entities, other, than, quantities, in, his, book, idea, makers, stephen, wolfram, defends, lovelace, s, contributions, while, acknowledging, that, babbage, wrote, several, unpublished, algorithms, for, the, analytical, engine, prior, to, lovelace, s, notes, wolfram, argues, that, there, s, nothing, as, sophisticated, or, as, clean, as, ada, s, computation, of, the, bernoulli, numbers, babbage, certainly, helped, and, commented, on, ada, s, work, but, she, was, definitely, the, driver, of, it, wolfram, then, suggests, that, lovelace, s, main, achievement, was, to, distill, from, babbage, s, correspondence, a, clear, exposition, of, the, abstract, operation, of, the, machine, something, which, babbage, never, did, the, computer, language, ada, created, on, behalf, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, was, named, after, lovelace, the,
