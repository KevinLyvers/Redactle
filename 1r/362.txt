lyric, poetry, titled, les, fleurs, du, mal, the, flowers, of, evil, expresses, the, changing, nature, of, beauty, in, the, rapidly, industrialising, paris, caused, by, haussmann, s, renovation, of, paris, during, the, mid, 19th, century, baudelaire, s, original, style, of, prose, poetry, influenced, a, generation, of, poets, including, paul, verlaine, arthur, rimbaud, and, st, phane, mallarm, he, coined, the, term, modernity, modernit, to, designate, the, fleeting, experience, of, life, in, an, urban, metropolis, and, the, responsibility, of, artistic, expression, to, capture, that, experience, marshall, berman, has, credited, baudelaire, as, being, the, first, modernist, baudelaire, was, born, in, paris, france, on, 9, april, 1821, and, baptized, two, months, later, at, saint, sulpice, roman, catholic, church, his, father, joseph, fran, ois, baudelaire, 1759, 1827, a, senior, civil, servant, and, amateur, artist, who, at, 60, was, 34, years, older, than, baudelaire, s, 26,

the, following, year, caroline, married, lieutenant, colonel, jacques, aupick, who, later, became, a, french, ambassador, to, various, noble, courts, baudelaire, s, biographers, have, often, seen, this, as, a, crucial, moment, considering, that, finding, himself, no, longer, the, sole, focus, of, his, mother, s, affection, left, him, with, a, trauma, which, goes, some, way, to, explaining, the, excesses, later, apparent, in, his, life, he, stated, in, a, letter, to, her, that, there, was, in, my, childhood, a, period, of, passionate, love, for, you, baudelaire, regularly, begged, his, mother, for, money, throughout, his, career, often, promising, that, a, lucrative, publishing, contract, or, journalistic, commission, was, just, around, the, corner, baudelaire, was, educated, in, lyon, where, he, boarded, at, 14, he, was, described, by, a, classmate, as, much, more, refined, and, distinguished, than, any, of, our, fellow, pupils, we, are, bound, to, one, another, by, shared, tastes, and, sympathies, the, precocious, love, of, fine, works, of, literature, baudelaire, was, erratic, in, his, studies, at, times, diligent, at, other, times, prone, to, idleness, later, he, attended, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, in, paris, studying, law, a, popular, course, for, those, not, yet, decided, on, any, particular, career, he, began, to, frequent, prostitutes, and, may, have, contracted, gonorrhea, and, syphilis, during, this, period, he, also, began, to, run, up, debts, mostly, for, clothes, upon, gaining, his, degree, in, 1839, he, told, his, brother, i, don, t, feel, i, have, a, vocation, for, anything, his, stepfather, had, in, mind, a, career, in, law, or, diplomacy, but, instead, baudelaire, decided, to, embark, upon, a, literary, career, his, mother, later, recalled, oh, what, grief, if, charles, had, let, himself, be, guided, by, his, stepfather, his, career, would, have, been, very, different, he, would, not, have, left, a, name, in, literature, it, is, true, but, we, should, have, been, happier, all, three, of, us, his, stepfather, sent, him, on, a, voyage, to, calcutta, india, in, 1841, in, the, hope, of, ending, his, dissolute, habits, the, trip, provided, strong, impressions, of, the, sea, sailing, and, exotic, ports, that, he, later, employed, in, his, poetry, baudelaire, later, exaggerated, his, aborted, trip, to, create, a, legend, about, his, youthful, travels, and, experiences, including, riding, on, elephants, on, returning, to, the, taverns, of, paris, he, began, to, compose, some, of, the, poems, of, les, fleurs, du, mal, at, 21, he, received, a, sizable, inheritance, but, squandered, much, of, it, within, a, few, years, his, family, obtained, a, decree, to, place, his, property, in, trust, which, he, resented, bitterly, at, one, point, arguing, that, allowing, him, to, fail, financially, would, have, been, the, one, sure, way, of, teaching, him, to, keep, his, finances, in, order, baudelaire, became, known, in, artistic, circles, as, a, dandy, and, free, spender, going, through, much, of, his, inheritance, and, allowance, in, a, short, period, of, time, during, this, time, jeanne, duval, a, haitian, born, actress, became, his, mistress, she, was, rejected, by, his, family, his, mother, thought, duval, a, black, venus, who, tortured, him, in, every, way, and, drained, him, of, money, at, every, opportunity, baudelaire, made, a, suicide, attempt, during, this, period, he, took, part, in, the, revolutions, of, 1848, and, wrote, for, a, revolutionary, newspaper, however, his, interest, in, politics, was, passing, as, he, was, later, to, note, in, his, journals, in, the, early, 1850s, baudelaire, struggled, with, poor, health, pressing, debts, and, irregular, literary, output, he, often, moved, from, one, lodging, to, another, to, escape, creditors, he, undertook, many, projects, that, he, was, unable, to, complete, though, he, did, finish, translations, of, stories, by, edgar, allan, poe, upon, the, death, of, his, stepfather, in, 1857, baudelaire, received, no, mention, in, the, will, but, he, was, heartened, nonetheless, that, the, division, with, his, mother, might, now, be, mended, at, 36, he, wrote, to, her, believe, that, i, belong, to, you, absolutely, and, that, i, belong, only, to, you, his, mother, died, on, 16, august, 1871, outliving, her, son, by, almost, four, years, his, first, published, work, under, the, pseudonym, baudelaire, dufa, s, was, his, art, review, salon, of, 1845, which, attracted, immediate, attention, for, its, boldness, many, of, his, critical, opinions, were, novel, in, their, time, including, his, championing, of, delacroix, and, some, of, his, views, seem, remarkably, in, tune, with, the, future, theories, of, the, impressionist, painters, in, 1846, baudelaire, wrote, his, second, salon, review, gaining, additional, credibility, as, an, advocate, and, critic, of, romanticism, his, continued, support, of, delacroix, as, the, foremost, romantic, artist, gained, widespread, notice, the, following, year, baudelaire, s, novella, la, fanfarlo, was, published, baudelaire, was, a, slow, and, very, attentive, worker, however, he, often, was, sidetracked, by, indolence, emotional, distress, and, illness, and, it, was, not, until, 1857, that, he, published, les, fleurs, du, mal, the, flowers, of, evil, his, first, and, most, famous, volume, of, poems, some, of, these, poems, had, already, appeared, in, the, revue, des, deux, mondes, review, of, two, worlds, in, 1855, when, they, were, published, by, baudelaire, s, friend, auguste, poulet, malassis, some, of, the, poems, had, appeared, as, fugitive, verse, in, various, french, magazines, during, the, previous, decade, the, poems, found, a, small, yet, appreciative, audience, however, greater, public, attention, was, given, to, their, subject, matter, the, effect, on, fellow, artists, was, as, th, odore, de, banville, stated, immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled, with, admiration, and, with, some, indefinable, anxious, fear, gustave, flaubert, recently, attacked, in, a, similar, fashion, for, madame, bovary, and, acquitted, was, impressed, and, wrote, to, baudelaire, you, have, found, a, way, to, rejuvenate, romanticism, you, are, as, unyielding, as, marble, and, as, penetrating, as, an, english, mist, the, principal, themes, of, sex, and, death, were, considered, scandalous, for, the, period, he, also, touched, on, lesbianism, sacred, and, profane, love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the, corruption, of, the, city, lost, innocence, the, oppressiveness, of, living, and, wine, notable, in, some, poems, is, baudelaire, s, use, of, imagery, of, the, sense, of, smell, and, of, fragrances, which, is, used, to, evoke, feelings, of, nostalgia, and, past, intimacy, the, book, however, quickly, became, a, byword, for, unwholesomeness, among, mainstream, critics, of, the, day, some, critics, called, a, few, of, the, poems, masterpieces, of, passion, art, and, poetry, but, other, poems, were, deemed, to, merit, no, less, than, legal, action, to, suppress, them, j, habas, led, the, charge, against, baudelaire, writing, in, le, figaro, everything, in, it, which, is, not, hideous, is, incomprehensible, everything, one, understands, is, putrid, baudelaire, responded, to, the, outcry, in, a, prophetic, letter, to, his, mother, you, know, that, i, have, always, considered, that, literature, and, the, arts, pursue, an, aim, independent, of, morality, beauty, of, conception, and, style, is, enough, for, me, but, this, book, whose, title, fleurs, du, mal, says, everything, is, clad, as, you, will, see, in, a, cold, and, sinister, beauty, it, was, created, with, rage, and, patience, besides, the, proof, of, its, positive, worth, is, in, all, the, ill, that, they, speak, of, it, the, book, enrages, people, moreover, since, i, was, terrified, myself, of, the, horror, that, i, should, inspire, i, cut, out, a, third, from, the, proofs, they, deny, me, everything, the, spirit, of, invention, and, even, the, knowledge, of, the, french, language, i, don, t, care, a, rap, about, all, these, imbeciles, and, i, know, that, this, book, with, its, virtues, and, its, faults, will, make, its, way, in, the, memory, of, the, lettered, public, beside, the, best, poems, of, v, hugo, th, gautier, and, even, byron, baudelaire, his, publisher, and, the, printer, were, successfully, prosecuted, for, creating, an, offense, against, public, morals, they, were, fined, but, baudelaire, was, not, imprisoned, six, of, the, poems, were, suppressed, but, printed, later, as, les, paves, the, wrecks, brussels, 1866, another, edition, of, les, fleurs, du, mal, without, these, poems, but, with, considerable, additions, appeared, in, 1861, many, notables, rallied, behind, baudelaire, and, condemned, the, sentence, victor, hugo, wrote, to, him, your, fleurs, du, mal, shine, and, dazzle, like, stars, i, applaud, your, vigorous, spirit, with, all, my, might, baudelaire, did, not, appeal, the, judgment, but, his, fine, was, reduced, nearly, 100, years, later, on, 11, may, 1949, baudelaire, was, vindicated, the, judgment, officially, reversed, and, the, six, banned, poems, reinstated, in, france, in, the, poem, au, lecteur, to, the, reader, that, prefaces, les, fleurs, du, mal, baudelaire, accuses, his, readers, of, hypocrisy, and, of, being, as, guilty, of, sins, and, lies, as, the, poet, baudelaire, next, worked, on, a, translation, and, adaptation, of, thomas, de, quincey, s, confessions, of, an, english, opium, eater, other, works, in, the, years, that, followed, included, petits, po, mes, en, prose, small, prose, poems, a, series, of, art, reviews, published, in, the, pays, exposition, universelle, country, world, fair, studies, on, gustave, flaubert, in, l, artiste, 18, october, 1857, on, th, ophile, gautier, revue, contemporaine, september, 1858, various, articles, contributed, to, eug, ne, cr, pet, s, po, tes, fran, ais, les, paradis, artificiels, opium, et, haschisch, french, poets, artificial, paradises, opium, and, hashish, 1860, and, un, dernier, chapitre, de, l, histoire, des, oeuvres, de, balzac, a, final, chapter, of, the, history, of, works, of, balzac, 1880, originally, an, article, comment, on, paye, ses, dettes, quand, on, a, du, g, nie, how, one, pays, one, s, debts, when, one, has, genius, in, which, his, criticism, turns, against, his, friends, honor, de, balzac, th, ophile, gautier, and, g, rard, de, nerval, by, 1859, his, illnesses, his, long, term, use, of, laudanum, his, life, of, stress, and, his, poverty, had, taken, a, toll, and, baudelaire, had, aged, noticeably, but, at, last, his, mother, relented, and, agreed, to, let, him, live, with, her, for, a, while, at, honfleur, baudelaire, was, productive, and, at, peace, in, the, seaside, town, his, poem, le, voyage, being, one, example, of, his, efforts, during, that, time, in, 1860, he, became, an, ardent, supporter, of, richard, wagner, his, financial, difficulties, increased, again, however, particularly, after, his, publisher, poulet, malassis, went, bankrupt, in, 1861, in, 1864, he, left, paris, for, belgium, partly, in, the, hope, of, selling, the, rights, to, his, works, and, to, give, lectures, his, long, standing, relationship, with, jeanne, duval, continued, on, and, off, and, he, helped, her, to, the, end, of, his, life, baudelaire, s, relationships, with, actress, marie, daubrun, and, with, courtesan, apollonie, sabatier, though, the, source, of, much, inspiration, never, produced, any, lasting, satisfaction, he, smoked, opium, and, in, brussels, he, began, to, drink, to, excess, baudelaire, suffered, a, massive, stroke, in, 1866, and, paralysis, followed, after, more, than, a, year, of, aphasia, he, received, the, last, rites, of, the, catholic, church, the, last, year, of, his, life, was, spent, in, a, semi, paralyzed, state, in, various, maisons, de, sant, in, brussels, and, in, paris, where, he, died, on, 31, august, 1867, baudelaire, is, buried, in, the, cimeti, re, du, montparnasse, paris, many, of, baudelaire, s, works, were, published, posthumously, after, his, death, his, mother, paid, off, his, substantial, debts, and, she, found, some, comfort, in, baudelaire, s, emerging, fame, i, see, that, my, son, for, all, his, faults, has, his, place, in, literature, she, lived, another, four, years, who, among, us, has, not, dreamt, in, moments, of, ambition, of, the, miracle, of, a, poetic, prose, musical, without, rhythm, and, rhyme, supple, and, staccato, enough, to, adapt, to, the, lyrical, stirrings, of, the, soul, the, undulations, of, dreams, and, sudden, leaps, of, consciousness, this, obsessive, idea, is, above, all, a, child, of, giant, cities, of, the, intersecting, of, their, myriad, relations, baudelaire, is, one, of, the, major, innovators, in, french, literature, his, poetry, is, influenced, by, the, french, romantic, poets, of, the, earlier, 19th, century, although, its, attention, to, the, formal, features, of, verse, connects, it, more, closely, to, the, work, of, the, contemporary, parnassians, as, for, theme, and, tone, in, his, works, we, see, the, rejection, of, the, belief, in, the, supremacy, of, nature, and, the, fundamental, goodness, of, man, as, typically, espoused, by, the, romantics, and, expressed, by, them, in, rhetorical, effusive, and, public, voice, in, favor, of, a, new, urban, sensibility, an, awareness, of, individual, moral, complexity, an, interest, in, vice, linked, with, decadence, and, refined, sensual, and, aesthetic, pleasures, and, the, use, of, urban, subject, matter, such, as, the, city, the, crowd, individual, passers, by, all, expressed, in, highly, ordered, verse, sometimes, through, a, cynical, and, ironic, voice, formally, the, use, of, sound, to, create, atmosphere, and, of, symbols, images, that, take, on, an, expanded, function, within, the, poem, betray, a, move, towards, considering, the, poem, as, a, self, referential, object, an, idea, further, developed, by, the, symbolists, verlaine, and, mallarm, who, acknowledge, baudelaire, as, a, pioneer, in, this, regard, beyond, his, innovations, in, versification, and, the, theories, of, symbolism, and, correspondences, an, awareness, of, which, is, essential, to, any, appreciation, of, the, literary, value, of, his, work, aspects, of, his, work, that, regularly, receive, much, critical, discussion, include, the, role, of, women, the, theological, direction, of, his, work, and, his, alleged, advocacy, of, satanism, his, experience, of, drug, induced, states, of, mind, the, figure, of, the, dandy, his, stance, regarding, democracy, and, its, implications, for, the, individual, his, response, to, the, spiritual, uncertainties, of, the, time, his, criticisms, of, the, bourgeois, and, his, advocacy, of, modern, music, and, painting, e, g, wagner, delacroix, he, made, paris, the, subject, of, modern, poetry, he, brought, the, city, s, details, to, life, in, the, eyes, and, hearts, of, his, readers, baudelaire, was, an, active, participant, in, the, artistic, life, of, his, times, as, critic, and, essayist, he, wrote, extensively, and, perceptively, about, the, luminaries, and, themes, of, french, culture, he, was, frank, with, friends, and, enemies, rarely, took, the, diplomatic, approach, and, sometimes, responded, violently, verbally, which, often, undermined, his, cause, his, associations, were, numerous, including, gustave, courbet, honor, daumier, f, licien, rops, franz, liszt, champfleury, victor, hugo, gustave, flaubert, and, balzac, in, 1847, baudelaire, became, acquainted, with, the, works, of, poe, in, which, he, found, tales, and, poems, that, had, he, claimed, long, existed, in, his, own, brain, but, never, taken, shape, baudelaire, saw, in, poe, a, precursor, and, tried, to, be, his, french, contemporary, counterpart, from, this, time, until, 1865, he, was, largely, occupied, with, translating, poe, s, works, his, translations, were, widely, praised, baudelaire, was, not, the, first, french, translator, of, poe, but, his, scrupulous, translations, were, considered, among, the, best, these, were, published, as, histoires, extraordinaires, extraordinary, stories, 1856, nouvelles, histoires, extraordinaires, new, extraordinary, stories, 1857, aventures, d, arthur, gordon, pym, eureka, and, histoires, grotesques, et, s, rieuses, grotesque, and, serious, stories, 1865, two, essays, on, poe, are, to, be, found, in, his, uvres, compl, tes, complete, works, vols, v, and, vi, a, strong, supporter, of, the, romantic, painter, delacroix, baudelaire, called, him, a, poet, in, painting, baudelaire, also, absorbed, much, of, delacroix, s, aesthetic, ideas, as, expressed, in, his, journals, as, baudelaire, elaborated, in, his, salon, of, 1846, as, one, contemplates, his, series, of, pictures, one, seems, to, be, attending, the, celebration, of, some, grievous, mystery, this, grave, and, lofty, melancholy, shines, with, a, dull, light, plaintive, and, profound, like, a, melody, by, weber, delacroix, though, appreciative, kept, his, distance, from, baudelaire, particularly, after, the, scandal, of, les, fleurs, du, mal, in, private, correspondence, delacroix, stated, that, baudelaire, really, gets, on, my, nerves, and, he, expressed, his, unhappiness, with, baudelaire, s, persistent, comments, about, melancholy, and, feverishness, baudelaire, had, no, formal, musical, training, and, knew, little, of, composers, beyond, beethoven, and, weber, weber, was, in, some, ways, wagner, s, precursor, using, the, leitmotif, and, conceiving, the, idea, of, the, total, art, work, gesamtkunstwerk, both, of, which, gained, baudelaire, s, admiration, before, even, hearing, wagner, s, music, baudelaire, studied, reviews, and, essays, about, him, and, formulated, his, impressions, later, baudelaire, put, them, into, his, non, technical, analysis, of, wagner, which, was, highly, regarded, particularly, his, essay, richard, wagner, et, tannh, user, paris, baudelaire, s, reaction, to, music, was, passionate, and, psychological, music, engulfs, possesses, me, like, the, sea, after, attending, three, wagner, concerts, in, paris, in, 1860, baudelaire, wrote, to, the, composer, i, had, a, feeling, of, pride, and, joy, in, understanding, in, being, possessed, in, being, overwhelmed, a, truly, sensual, pleasure, like, that, of, rising, in, the, air, baudelaire, s, writings, contributed, to, the, elevation, of, wagner, and, to, the, cult, of, wagnerism, that, swept, europe, in, the, following, decades, gautier, writer, and, poet, earned, baudelaire, s, respect, for, his, perfection, of, form, and, his, mastery, of, language, though, baudelaire, thought, he, lacked, deeper, emotion, and, spirituality, both, strove, to, express, the, artist, s, inner, vision, which, heinrich, heine, earlier, stated, in, artistic, matters, i, am, a, supernaturalist, i, believe, that, the, artist, can, not, find, all, his, forms, in, nature, but, that, the, most, remarkable, are, revealed, to, him, in, his, soul, gautier, s, frequent, meditations, on, death, and, the, horror, of, life, are, themes, which, influenced, baudelaire, s, writings, in, gratitude, for, their, friendship, and, commonality, of, vision, baudelaire, dedicated, les, fleurs, du, mal, to, gautier, manet, and, baudelaire, became, constant, companions, from, around, 1855, in, the, early, 1860s, baudelaire, accompanied, manet, on, daily, sketching, trips, and, often, met, him, socially, manet, also, lent, baudelaire, money, and, looked, after, his, affairs, particularly, when, baudelaire, went, to, belgium, baudelaire, encouraged, manet, to, strike, out, on, his, own, path, and, not, succumb, to, criticism, manet, has, great, talent, a, talent, which, will, stand, the, test, of, time, but, he, has, a, weak, character, he, seems, to, me, crushed, and, stunned, by, shock, in, his, painting, music, in, the, tuileries, manet, includes, portraits, of, his, friends, th, ophile, gautier, jacques, offenbach, and, baudelaire, while, it, s, difficult, to, differentiate, who, influenced, whom, both, manet, and, baudelaire, discussed, and, expressed, some, common, themes, through, their, respective, arts, baudelaire, praised, the, modernity, of, manet, s, subject, matter, almost, all, our, originality, comes, from, the, stamp, that, time, imprints, upon, our, feelings, when, manet, s, famous, olympia, 1865, a, portrait, of, a, nude, prostitute, provoked, a, scandal, for, its, blatant, realism, mixed, with, an, imitation, of, renaissance, motifs, baudelaire, worked, privately, to, support, his, friend, though, he, offered, no, public, defense, he, was, however, ill, at, the, time, when, baudelaire, returned, from, belgium, after, his, stroke, manet, and, his, wife, were, frequent, visitors, at, the, nursing, home, and, she, played, passages, from, wagner, for, baudelaire, on, the, piano, nadar, f, lix, tournachon, was, a, noted, caricaturist, scientist, and, important, early, photographer, baudelaire, admired, nadar, one, of, his, close, friends, and, wrote, nadar, is, the, most, amazing, manifestation, of, vitality, they, moved, in, similar, circles, and, baudelaire, made, many, social, connections, through, him, nadar, s, ex, mistress, jeanne, duval, became, baudelaire, s, mistress, around, 1842, baudelaire, became, interested, in, photography, in, the, 1850s, and, denouncing, it, as, an, art, form, advocated, its, return, to, its, real, purpose, which, is, that, of, being, the, servant, to, the, sciences, and, arts, photography, should, not, according, to, baudelaire, encroach, upon, the, domain, of, the, impalpable, and, the, imaginary, nadar, remained, a, stalwart, friend, right, to, baudelaire, s, last, days, and, wrote, his, obituary, notice, in, le, figaro, many, of, baudelaire, s, philosophical, proclamations, were, considered, scandalous, and, intentionally, provocative, in, his, time, he, wrote, on, a, wide, range, of, subjects, drawing, criticism, and, outrage, from, many, quarters, along, with, poe, baudelaire, named, the, arch, reactionary, joseph, de, maistre, as, his, ma, tre, penser, and, adopted, increasingly, aristocratic, views, in, his, journals, he, wrote, there, is, no, form, of, rational, and, assured, government, save, an, aristocracy, there, are, but, three, beings, worthy, of, respect, the, priest, the, warrior, and, the, poet, to, know, to, kill, and, to, create, the, rest, of, mankind, may, be, taxed, and, drudged, they, are, born, for, the, stable, that, is, to, say, to, practise, what, they, call, professions, baudelaire, s, influence, on, the, direction, of, modern, french, and, english, language, literature, was, considerable, the, most, significant, french, writers, to, come, after, him, were, generous, with, tributes, four, years, after, his, death, arthur, rimbaud, praised, him, in, a, letter, as, the, king, of, poets, a, true, god, in, 1895, st, phane, mallarm, published, le, tombeau, de, charles, baudelaire, a, sonnet, in, baudelaire, s, memory, marcel, proust, in, an, essay, published, in, 1922, stated, that, along, with, alfred, de, vigny, baudelaire, was, the, greatest, poet, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, english, speaking, world, edmund, wilson, credited, baudelaire, as, providing, an, initial,
