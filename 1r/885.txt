not, with, metaphysical, nirguna, brahman, but, with, the, help, of, personal, god, and, saguna, vishnu, ramanuja, believed, that, when, scriptures, such, as, the, vedas, declare, god, as, nirguna, they, should, be, interpreted, as, saying, that, qualities, such, as, pain, sorrow, mortality, and, age, are, absent, in, god, ramanuja, has, long, enjoyed, foremost, authority, in, the, sri, vaishnava, tradition, a, number, of, traditional, biographies, of, ramanuja, are, known, some, written, in, 12th, century, but, some, written, centuries, later, such, as, the, 17th, or, 18th, century, particularly, after, the, split, of, the, r, vai, ava, community, into, the, vadakalais, and, te, kalais, where, each, community, created, its, own, version, of, ramanuja, s, hagiography, the, muv, yirappa, i, guruparampar, prabh, va, by, brahmatantra, svatantra, j, yar, represents, the, earliest, vadakalai, biography, and, reflects, the, vadakalai, view, of, the, succession, following,

grew, up, in, the, tamil, culture, in, a, stable, society, during, the, rule, of, the, chola, dynasty, this, period, was, one, of, pluralistic, beliefs, where, vaishnava, shaiva, smarta, traditions, buddhism, and, jainism, thrived, together, in, hindu, monastic, tradition, advaita, ved, nta, had, been, dominant, and, ramanuja, s, guru, y, dava, pr, k, sha, belonged, to, this, tradition, prior, to, ramanuja, the, sri, vaishnava, sampradaya, was, already, an, established, organization, under, yamun, ch, rya, and, bhakti, songs, and, devotional, ideas, already, a, part, of, tamil, culture, because, of, the, twelve, alv, rs, ramanuja, s, fame, grew, because, he, was, considered, the, first, thinker, in, centuries, that, disputed, shankara, s, theories, and, offered, an, alternative, interpretation, of, upanishadic, scriptures, when, ramanuja, and, his, guru, yadava, prakaasa, parted, ways, due, to, their, differences, in, interpreting, the, vedic, literature, ramanuja, became, a, devotee, of, the, varadaraja, perumal, temple, in, kanchi, during, this, period, ramanuja, s, discourses, and, fame, reached, far, and, wide, yamunacharya, the, vaishnavite, acharya, and, the, religious, head, of, the, ranganathasamy, temple, at, srirangam, had, been, closely, following, ramanuja, from, a, very, young, age, when, it, was, time, to, pass, on, the, legacy, the, acharya, decided, that, he, would, call, upon, ramanuja, accordingly, he, summoned, sri, mahapurna, a, disciple, who, was, helping, him, out, with, the, temple, affairs, and, asked, him, to, go, to, kanchi, and, bring, ramanuja, when, mahapurna, met, ramanuja, and, informed, him, of, his, guru, s, desire, ramanuja, was, overjoyed, and, they, both, immediately, left, for, srirangam, but, bad, news, awaited, them, at, srirangam, and, they, both, learned, that, yamunacharya, had, died, heart, broken, ramanuja, then, left, for, kanchi, and, refused, to, worship, sri, ranganatha, for, he, held, him, responsible, for, taking, away, yamunacharya, from, this, world, as, for, mahapurna, he, began, to, assist, tiruvaranga, araiyar, the, son, of, yamunacharya, in, managing, the, temple, affairs, but, as, time, passed, by, tiruvaranga, araiyar, and, other, senior, members, of, the, vaishnavite, order, felt, that, there, was, a, vacuum, after, yamunacharya, s, demise, and, that, they, lacked, a, person, who, could, interpret, the, vedas, and, sastras, like, yamunacharya, so, it, was, finally, decided, that, sri, mahapurna, should, once, again, go, and, invite, ramanuja, to, srirangam, meanwhile, in, kanchi, ramanuja, met, with, kanchipurna, a, fellow, devotee, regularly, and, soon, decided, that, he, would, become, kanchipurna, s, disciple, when, he, approached, kanchipurna, about, this, kanchipurna, politely, refused, as, he, did, not, belong, to, the, same, caste, as, ramanuja, and, told, him, that, he, would, get, a, more, appropriate, guru, after, this, kanchipurna, left, for, tirupati, to, worship, lord, venkateswara, and, would, return, only, after, six, months, when, he, finally, came, back, it, was, through, him, that, lord, varadaraja, conveyed, his, wish, to, ramanuja, accordingly, kanchipurna, advised, ramanuja, that, it, was, the, lord, s, wish, that, he, leave, for, srirangam, and, find, solace, in, sri, mahapurna, after, it, was, decided, that, mahapurna, would, go, and, invite, ramanuja, to, srirangam, the, acharya, left, for, kanchi, with, his, wife, while, on, his, way, to, kanchi, mahapurna, and, his, wife, decided, to, take, some, rest, at, maduranthakam, a, place, that, is, located, 40, km, from, present, day, chennai, as, fate, would, have, it, ramanuja, who, was, on, his, way, to, srirangam, arrived, at, the, same, place, and, to, his, joy, found, mahapurna, they, soon, embraced, each, other, and, ramanuja, requested, that, he, waste, no, time, in, initiating, him, into, the, vaishnavite, order, mahapurna, immediately, obliged, and, ramanuja, received, the, panchasamskaras, the, five, sacraments, some, hagiographies, composed, centuries, after, ramanuja, died, state, that, a, chola, king, kulothunga, ii, had, immense, hatred, towards, sri, vaishnavism, he, was, called, krimikanta, chola, or, worm, necked, chola, so, called, as, the, king, is, said, to, have, suffered, from, the, cancer, of, the, neck, or, throat, historian, nilakanta, sastri, identifies, krimikanta, chola, with, adhirajendra, chola, or, virarajendra, chola, with, whom, the, main, line, vijayalaya, line, ended, knowing, the, evil, intentions, of, the, king, sri, r, m, nuj, s, disciple, sri, koorathazhwan, persuaded, ramanuja, to, leave, the, chola, kingdom, sri, r, m, nuj, then, moved, to, hoysala, kingdom, for, 14, years, wherein, he, converted, a, jain, king, bitti, deva, to, hinduism, after, miraculously, healing, his, daughter, bitti, deva, changed, his, name, to, vishnuvardhana, king, vishnuvardhana, assisted, sri, r, m, nuj, to, build, a, temple, of, lord, thirunarayanaswamy, at, melukote, which, is, now, a, temple, town, in, mandya, district, of, karnataka, r, m, nuj, later, returned, on, his, own, to, tamil, n, du, after, the, demise, of, krimikanta, chola, according, to, sastri, krimikanta, or, adhirajendra, chola, was, killed, in, a, local, uprising, of, the, vaishnavas, according, to, koil, olugu, temple, records, of, the, srirangam, temple, kulottunga, iii, was, the, son, of, krimikanta, chola, or, karikala, chola, the, former, unlike, his, father, is, said, to, have, been, a, repentant, son, who, supported, vaishnavism, ramanuja, is, said, to, have, made, kulottunga, iii, as, a, disciple, of, his, nephew, dasarathi, the, king, then, granted, the, management, of, the, ranganathaswamy, temple, to, dasarathi, and, his, descendants, as, per, the, wish, of, ramanuja, some, historians, hold, that, krimikanta, who, persecuted, ramanuja, had, a, personal, animosity, towards, ramanuja, and, did, not, persecute, vaishnavites, the, sri, vaishnavite, order, prior, to, ramanuja, was, not, averse, to, people, from, other, castes, as, both, kanchipurna, and, mahapurna, were, non, brahmins, so, when, ramanuja, revolted, against, the, discrimination, that, had, crept, within, the, caste, system, he, was, simply, following, the, same, lines, as, the, alwars, and, helped, the, people, who, were, considered, to, be, untouchables, dasa, dasulu, dasu, to, get, absorbed, into, the, sri, vaishnava, bhakti, movement, encouraging, them, to, attain, spiritual, enlightenment, by, teaching, them, sri, alwar, divyaprabandham, he, called, these, downtrodden, classes, as, tirukulattar, meaning, of, noble, descent, in, tamil, and, was, instrumental, in, admitting, them, into, the, temple, in, melukote, ramanuja, s, liberal, views, also, led, to, the, reorganization, of, rituals, in, srirangam, and, the, involvement, of, non, brahmin, people, in, the, vaishnava, worship, this, policy, change, contributed, to, the, enhancement, of, social, status, for, artisanal, and, other, non, brahmin, caste, groups, especially, the, weavers, senguntharkaikola, mudaliyar, who, were, one, of, the, chief, beneficiaries, after, the, period, of, ramanuja, the, sri, vaishnava, community, split, on, this, issue, and, formed, the, vadakalai, northern, and, sanskritic, and, thenkalai, southern, and, tamil, sects, both, sects, believe, in, initiation, into, sri, vaishnavism, through, pancha, samskara, this, ceremony, or, rite, of, passage, is, necessary, for, one, to, become, a, sri, vaishnava, brahmin, it, is, performed, by, brahmins, and, non, brahmins, in, order, to, become, vaishnavas, there, were, multiple, attempts, on, ramanuja, s, life, when, he, was, a, student, under, yadava, prakasa, the, latter, grew, jealous, of, ramanuja, s, rise, to, fame, so, yadava, prakasa, tried, to, get, rid, of, ramanuja, during, a, tour, to, the, ganges, in, northern, india, govinda, ramanuja, s, cousin, son, of, his, mother, s, sister, learned, of, this, plot, and, warned, ramanuja, who, then, left, the, group, and, escaped, to, kanchi, with, the, help, of, an, elderly, hunter, couple, later, yadava, prakasa, realised, his, folly, and, became, a, disciple, under, ramanuja, later, another, attempt, was, made, on, ramanuja, s, life, while, he, was, about, to, take, charge, of, the, temple, affairs, in, srirangam, the, head, priest, of, the, ranganathaswamy, temple, srirangam, did, not, like, ramanuja, and, decided, to, kill, him, accordingly, he, invited, ramanuja, to, his, house, for, having, food, and, planned, to, kill, him, by, poisoning, his, food, however, when, ramanuja, arrived, the, priest, s, wife, saw, the, divine, glow, of, ramanuja, and, immediately, confessed, her, husband, s, plan, this, did, not, deter, the, priest, who, then, made, another, attempt, when, ramanuja, visited, the, temple, he, poisoned, the, temple, theertham, holy, water, and, served, it, to, ramanuja, however, instead, of, dying, ramanuja, began, to, dance, with, joy, the, priest, taken, aback, at, once, realised, his, mistake, and, fell, at, the, feet, of, ramanuja, the, sri, vaisnava, tradition, attributes, nine, sanskrit, texts, to, ramanuja, vedarthasamgraha, literally, summary, of, the, vedas, s, meaning, sri, bhashya, a, review, and, commentary, on, the, brahma, sutras, bhagavad, gita, bhashya, a, review, and, commentary, on, the, bhagavad, gita, and, the, minor, works, titled, vedantadipa, vedantasara, gadya, trayam, which, is, a, compilation, of, three, texts, called, the, sharanagati, gadyam, sriranga, gadyam, and, the, vaikuntha, gadyam, and, the, nitya, grantham, some, scholars, have, questioned, the, authenticity, of, the, majority, of, his, work, except, the, three, of, the, largest, works, credited, to, ramanuja, sri, bhashya, vedarthasamgraha, and, the, bhagavad, gita, bhashya, ramanuja, s, philosophical, foundation, was, qualified, monism, and, is, called, vishishtadvaita, in, the, hindu, tradition, his, ideas, are, one, of, three, subschools, in, ved, nta, the, other, two, are, known, as, di, shankara, s, advaita, absolute, monism, and, madhv, ch, rya, s, dvaita, dualism, r, m, nuja, s, epistemology, is, hyperrealistic, or, similar, to, na, ve, empiricism, the, first, two, sources, of, knowledge, are, perception, and, inference, and, they, are, trustworthy, notwithstanding, general, human, subjection, to, beginningless, ignorance, knowledge, is, always, of, the, real, even, in, dreams, and, error, is, a, disordered, perception, or, faulty, inference, concerning, what, is, really, there, the, third, source, of, knowledge, is, the, testimony, of, scripture, or, more, strictly, abda, eternal, sound, which, helps, to, establish, much, that, is, uncertain, on, the, basis, of, sense, perception, and, inference, notably, the, existence, and, nature, of, the, ultimate, reality, brahman, though, unlike, some, proponents, of, na, ve, empiricism, r, m, nuja, does, not, think, that, it, suffices, to, intermittently, have, an, acquaintance, with, objects, of, knowledge, knowledge, j, na, only, occurs, when, there, is, direct, perception, of, an, object, unlike, proper, empiricists, r, m, nuja, does, not, restrict, knowledge, to, that, which, can, be, gathered, from, the, senses, r, m, nuja, asserts, that, knowledge, about, god, comes, exclusively, from, the, vedic, scriptures, particularly, the, upanisads, rather, than, from, sensory, perception, or, logical, inference, r, m, nuja, was, unique, in, his, view, that, bhakti, or, devotion, is, itself, an, epistemic, state, he, says, that, when, bhakti, takes, firm, root, in, an, individual, it, turns, into, parabhakti, which, is, the, highest, form, of, bhakti, and, that, bhakti, is, the, direct, awareness, of, brahman, s, nature, and, thus, is, a, kind, of, knowledge, j, na, being, a, realist, r, m, nuja, firmly, opposed, the, notion, of, m, y, illusion, in, his, understanding, three, distinct, realities, exist, a, vast, expanse, of, material, objects, countless, conscious, souls, within, material, bodies, and, the, transcendent, brahman, each, of, these, categories, possesses, a, different, degree, of, awareness, from, the, non, aware, material, world, to, the, fully, aware, brahman, but, they, are, all, equally, real, in, r, m, nuja, s, interpretation, of, advaita, non, dualism, it, is, not, a, form, of, advaita, as, proposed, by, shankara, r, m, nuja, s, conception, of, bhakti, maintains, that, there, must, always, be, a, separation, between, the, lover, the, soul, and, the, beloved, vishnu, for, true, love, cannot, exist, without, distinct, identities, his, stance, suggests, a, qualified, non, dualism, where, both, the, souls, and, the, material, world, though, deeply, interconnected, with, brahman, eternally, remain, different, from, brahman, in, r, m, nuja, s, philosophy, the, foundational, concept, of, the, soul, body, model, revolves, around, the, idea, that, the, entire, universe, including, both, souls, jivas, and, matter, prakrti, serves, as, the, body, sarira, of, god, referred, to, as, sarira, sariri, bhava, where, sarira, means, body, and, sariri, means, the, indwelling, soul, or, consciousness, this, concept, is, rooted, in, sruti, passages, like, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, 3, 7, 3, 23, this, soul, of, yours, who, is, present, within, but, is, different, from, all, beings, whom, all, beings, do, not, know, whose, body, is, all, beings, and, who, controls, all, beings, from, within, he, is, the, inner, controller, the, immortal, one, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, 3, 7, 14, according, to, r, m, nuja, the, highest, good, lies, in, realizing, our, true, nature, and, of, understanding, the, true, essence, of, brahman, moksha, or, spiritual, liberation, is, seen, as, the, joy, of, contemplating, brahman, rather, than, release, from, the, life, death, rebirth, cycle, and, that, joy, is, the, result, of, devotion, praise, worship, and, contemplation, of, divine, perfection, knowledge, of, brahman, consists, in, liberation, for, r, m, nuja, mainly, because, of, the, character, of, brahman, according, to, ramanuja, brahman, encompasses, everything, but, is, not, uniform, in, nature, it, includes, elements, of, plurality, allowing, it, to, manifest, in, a, diverse, world, ramanuja, views, brahman, as, a, personal, god, who, rules, over, a, real, world, filled, with, his, spirit, he, believes, brahman, to, have, the, attributes, of, omnipotence, omniscience, and, infinite, love, he, writes, entities, other, than, brahman, can, be, objects, of, such, cognitions, of, the, nature, of, joy, only, to, a, finite, extent, and, for, limited, duration, but, brahman, is, such, that, cognizing, of, him, is, an, infinite, and, abiding, joy, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, ruti, says, brahman, is, bliss, taittir, ya, upani, ad, ii, 6, since, the, form, of, cognition, as, joy, is, determined, by, its, object, brahman, itself, is, joy, r, m, nuja, clarifies, that, mere, theoretical, knowledge, of, brahman, s, nature, is, insufficient, for, attaining, m, oksha, according, to, r, m, nuja, bhakti, yoga, the, discipline, of, devotion, or, worship, is, the, effective, means, for, liberation, in, his, interpretation, moksha, is, not, a, negative, separation, from, transmigration, or, a, series, of, rebirths, but, rather, the, joy, of, the, contemplating, the, divine, perfection, this, joy, is, attained, by, a, life, of, exclusive, devotion, bhakti, to, brahman, singing, his, praise, performing, adulatory, acts, in, temple, and, private, worship, and, constantly, dwelling, on, his, perfections, in, return, brahman, will, offer, his, grace, which, will, assist, the, devotee, in, gaining, release, ramanuja, s, ethical, framework, asserts, that, morality, has, both, intrinsic, and, instrumental, value, intrinsically, morality, mirrors, the, divine, nature, of, god, who, is, morally, perfect, and, needs, no, external, reasons, to, be, moral, instrumentally, morality, serves, as, a, means, to, alleviate, the, karmic, burdens, of, past, wrongdoings, and, to, appease, the, divine, thus, facilitating, spiritual, liberation, ramanuja, emphasizes, that, while, detachment, through, jnana, yoga, is, possible, in, theory, it, is, impractical, for, most, instead, he, advocates, karma, yoga, which, involves, fulfilling, duties, based, on, individual, capabilities, and, nature, making, morality, accessible, and, suited, to, individual, lives, ramanuja, argued, that, shankara, s, interpretation, of, the, upanishads, had, serious, errors, he, had, four, major, objections, ramanuja, accepted, that, the, vedas, are, a, reliable, source, of, knowledge, then, critiqued, other, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, including, advaita, ved, nta, as, having, failed, in, interpreting, all, of, the, vedic, texts, he, asserted, in, his, sri, bh, shya, that, purvapaksin, previous, schools, selectively, interpret, those, upanishadic, passages, that, support, their, monistic, interpretation, and, ignore, those, passages, that, support, the, pluralism, interpretation, there, is, no, reason, stated, ramanuja, to, prefer, one, part, of, a, scripture, and, not, other, the, whole, of, the, scripture, must, be, considered, on, par, one, cannot, according, to, ramanuja, attempt, to, give, interpretations, of, isolated, portions, of, any, scripture, rather, the, scripture, must, be, considered, one, integrated, corpus, expressing, a, consistent, doctrine, the, vedic, literature, asserted, ramanuja, mention, both, plurality, and, oneness, therefore, the, truth, must, incorporate, pluralism, and, monism, or, qualified, monism, this, method, of, scripture, interpretation, distinguishes, ramanuja, from, di, shankara, shankara, s, exegetical, approach, samanvayat, tatparya, linga, with, anvaya, vyatireka, states, that, for, proper, understanding, all, texts, must, be, examined, in, their, entirety, and, then, their, intent, established, by, six, characteristics, these, include, studying, what, the, author, states, as, his, goal, what, he, repeats, in, his, explanation, what, he, states, as, his, conclusion, and, whether, it, can, be, epistemically, verified, not, everything, in, any, text, states, shankara, has, equal, weight, and, some, ideas, are, the, essence, of, any, expert, s, textual, testimony, this, philosophical, difference, in, scriptural, studies, helped, shankara, conclude, that, the, principal, upanishads, primarily, teach, monism, with, teachings, such, as, tat, tvam, asi, while, helping, ramanuja, conclude, that, qualified, monism, is, at, the,
