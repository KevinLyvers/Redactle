kurt, lewin, l, v, i, n, l, veen, 9, september, 1890, 12, february, 1947, was, a, german, american, psychologist, known, as, one, of, the, modern, pioneers, of, social, organizational, and, applied, psychology, in, the, united, states, during, his, professional, career, lewin, s, academic, research, and, writings, focuses, on, applied, research, action, research, and, group, communication, lewin, is, often, recognized, as, the, founder, of, social, psychology, and, was, one, of, the, first, to, study, group, dynamics, and, organizational, development, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, lewin, as, the, 18th, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, during, his, career, he, was, affiliated, with, several, u, s, and, european, universities, including, the, university, of, berlin, cornell, university, mit, stanford, university, and, the, university, of, iowa, lewin, was, born, in, 1890, into, a, jewish, family, in, mogilno, county, of, mogilno, province, of, posen, prussia, in, present, day, poland, a, small, village, with, then, about, 5, 000, residents, about, 150, of, whom, were, jewish, lewin, received, an, orthodox, jewish, education, at, home, he, was, one, of, four, children, born, into, a, middle, class, family, his, father, owned, a, small, general, store, and, the, family, lived, in, an, apartment, above, the, store, his, father, leopold, operated, a, farm, jointly, with, his, brother, max, however, the, farm, was, legally, owned, by, a, christian, because, jews, were, not, permitted, to, own, farms, at, the, time, in, 1905, lewin, moved, with, his, family, to, berlin, so, lewin, and, his, brothers, could, receive, a, better, education, from, 1905, to, 1908, lewin, studied, at, the, kaiserin, augusta, gymnasium, where, he, received, a, classical, humanistic, education, in, 1909, he, entered, the, university, of, freiburg, to, study, medicine, but, transferred, to, the, university, of, munich, to, study, biology, at, the, university, of, munich, he, became, involved, with, the, socialist, and, women, s, rights, movements, around, this, time, in, april, 1910, lewin, transferred, to, the, royal, friedrich, wilhelms, university, of, berlin, where, he, was, still, a, medical, student, by, the, easter, semester, of, 1911, his, interests, had, shifted, toward, philosophy, by, the, summer, of, 1911, the, majority, of, his, courses, were, in, psychology, while, at, the, university, of, berlin, lewin, took, 14, courses, with, carl, stumpf, 1848, 1936, when, world, war, i, began, he, served, in, the, imperial, german, army, during, which, he, sustained, a, war, wound, and, returned, to, the, university, of, berlin, to, complete, his, phd, lewin, wrote, a, dissertation, proposal, asking, stumpf, to, be, his, supervisor, and, stumpf, assented, even, though, lewin, worked, under, stumpf, to, complete, his, dissertation, their, relationship, did, not, involve, much, communication, lewin, studied, associations, will, and, intention, for, his, dissertation, but, he, did, not, discuss, it, with, stumpf, until, his, final, doctoral, examination, lewin, was, originally, involved, with, schools, of, behavioral, psychology, before, changing, directions, in, research, and, undertaking, work, with, psychologists, of, the, gestalt, school, of, psychology, including, max, wertheimer, and, wolfgang, k, hler, he, also, joined, the, psychological, institute, of, the, university, of, berlin, where, he, lectured, and, gave, seminars, on, both, philosophy, and, psychology, he, served, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, berlin, from, 1926, to, 1932, during, which, time, he, conducted, experiments, about, tension, states, needs, motivation, and, learning, in, 1933, lewin, had, tried, to, negotiate, a, teaching, position, as, the, chair, of, psychology, and, creating, a, research, institute, at, hebrew, university, in, jerusalem, lewin, often, associated, with, the, early, frankfurt, school, originated, by, an, influential, group, of, largely, jewish, marxists, at, the, institute, for, social, research, in, germany, but, when, adolf, hitler, came, to, power, in, nazi, germany, in, 1933, the, institute, members, disbanded, and, moved, to, england, and, then, to, the, united, states, the, same, year, he, met, with, eric, trist, of, the, london, tavistock, clinic, trist, was, impressed, with, his, theories, and, went, on, to, use, them, in, his, studies, on, soldiers, during, world, war, ii, in, august, 1933, lewin, immigrated, to, the, u, s, where, in, 1940, became, a, naturalized, citizen, a, few, years, after, relocating, to, the, u, s, lewin, began, asking, people, to, pronounce, his, name, as, lou, in, rather, than, le, veen, because, the, mispronunciation, of, his, name, by, americans, had, led, to, many, missed, phone, calls, however, shortly, before, his, death, he, began, requesting, students, and, colleagues, to, use, the, correct, pronunciation, le, veen, because, that, is, the, one, he, preferred, earlier, in, 1930, he, spent, six, months, as, a, visiting, professor, at, stanford, university, after, his, immigration, to, the, u, s, lewin, worked, at, cornell, university, the, iowa, child, welfare, research, station, at, the, university, of, iowa, and, as, director, of, the, center, for, group, dynamics, at, mit, following, world, war, ii, lewin, was, involved, in, the, psychological, rehabilitation, of, former, occupants, of, displaced, persons, camps, with, dr, jacob, fine, at, harvard, medical, school, when, trist, and, a, t, m, wilson, wrote, to, lewin, proposing, a, journal, in, partnership, with, their, newly, founded, tavistock, institute, and, his, group, at, mit, lewin, agreed, the, tavistock, journal, human, relations, was, founded, with, two, early, papers, by, lewin, entitled, frontiers, in, group, dynamics, lewin, taught, for, a, time, at, duke, university, lewin, coined, the, notion, of, genidentity, which, has, gained, some, importance, in, various, theories, of, space, time, and, related, fields, for, instance, he, introduced, the, concept, of, hodological, space, or, the, simplest, route, achieved, through, the, resolution, of, different, field, of, forces, oppositions, and, tensions, according, to, their, goals, lewin, also, proposed, herbert, blumer, s, interactionist, perspective, of, 1937, as, an, alternative, to, the, nature, versus, nurture, debate, lewin, suggested, that, neither, nature, inborn, tendencies, nor, nurture, how, experiences, in, life, shape, individuals, alone, can, account, for, individuals, behavior, and, personalities, but, rather, that, both, nature, and, nurture, interact, to, shape, each, person, this, idea, was, presented, in, the, form, of, lewin, s, equation, for, behavior, b, p, e, which, means, that, behavior, b, is, a, function, f, of, personal, characteristics, p, and, environmental, characteristics, e, scholars, in, the, 1930s, reveled, in, fear, that, by, devoting, themselves, to, applied, research, they, would, distract, the, discipline, from, basic, research, on, scholarly, problems, and, create, a, false, binary, on, whether, research, was, developed, for, the, perpetuation, of, their, respective, discipline, or, for, practical, application, despite, this, debate, within, the, social, sciences, at, the, time, lewin, argued, that, applied, research, could, be, conducted, with, rigor, and, that, one, could, test, theoretical, propositions, in, applied, research, the, root, of, this, particular, binary, seemed, to, stem, from, the, epistemological, norms, present, within, the, hard, sciences, where, the, distinction, was, much, more, pronounced, kurt, lewin, argued, that, this, was, contrary, to, the, nature, of, the, social, sciences, with, the, help, of, scholars, including, paul, lazarsfeld, there, was, a, method, through, which, money, could, be, acquired, for, research, in, a, sustainable, manner, lewin, has, encouraged, researchers, to, develop, theories, that, can, be, used, to, address, important, social, problems, to, demonstrate, his, dedication, to, applied, research, and, to, further, prove, that, there, was, value, in, testing, his, theoretical, propositions, lewin, became, a, master, at, transposing, an, everyday, problem, into, a, psychological, experiment, lewin, in, his, beginnings, took, a, seemingly, banal, moment, between, himself, and, a, waiter, and, turned, it, into, the, beginnings, of, his, field, research, which, lewin, reasoned, that, the, intention, to, carry, out, a, specific, task, builds, a, psychological, tension, which, is, released, when, the, intended, task, is, completed, in, tandem, with, when, sigmund, freud, theorized, that, wishes, persist, until, they, are, satisfied, this, happenstance, observation, started, the, demonstration, of, the, existence, of, psychic, tensions, fundamental, to, lewin, s, field, theory, while, applied, research, helped, develop, lewin, into, a, practical, theorist, what, further, defined, him, as, an, academic, and, a, forerunner, was, his, action, research, a, term, he, invented, himself, lewin, was, increasingly, interested, in, the, concepts, of, jewish, migration, and, identity, he, was, confused, by, the, concept, of, how, while, an, individual, distanced, themselves, from, performing, the, jewish, identity, in, terms, of, religious, expression, and, performance, they, were, still, considered, jewish, in, the, eyes, of, nazis, this, concept, of, denying, one, s, identity, and, the, promotion, of, self, loathing, as, a, form, of, coping, with, a, dominant, group, s, oppression, represented, the, crisis, of, lewin, s, own, migration, to, the, united, states, lewin, as, his, student, and, colleague, ron, lippitt, described, had, a, deep, sensitivity, to, social, problems, and, a, commitment, to, use, his, resources, as, a, social, scientist, to, do, something, about, them, in, the, early, 1940s, he, drew, a, triangle, to, represent, the, interdependence, of, research, training, and, action, in, producing, social, change, this, diagramming, of, an, academic, s, interests, and, actions, within, this, triangulation, yields, an, interesting, part, of, accessing, lewin, and, his, contributions, rather, than, noting, social, justice, as, the, beginning, or, the, end, it, was, ingrained, in, every, single, academic, action, that, lewin, took, it, was, this, particular, world, view, and, paradigm, that, furthered, his, research, and, determined, precisely, how, he, was, going, to, utilize, the, findings, from, his, field, research, furthermore, it, all, reflected, upon, lewin, the, man, and, his, way, of, coping, with, the, events, of, his, time, period, this, devotion, to, action, research, was, possibly, a, way, of, resolving, a, dissonance, of, his, own, passage, to, america, and, how, he, left, his, own, back, in, present, day, poland, prominent, psychologists, mentored, by, lewin, included, leon, festinger, 1919, 1989, who, became, known, for, his, cognitive, dissonance, theory, 1956, environmental, psychologist, roger, barker, bluma, zeigarnik, and, morton, deutsch, the, founder, of, modern, conflict, resolution, theory, and, practice, force, field, analysis, provides, a, framework, for, looking, at, the, factors, forces, that, influence, a, situation, originally, social, situations, it, looks, at, forces, that, are, either, driving, movement, toward, a, goal, helping, forces, or, blocking, movement, toward, a, goal, hindering, forces, key, to, this, approach, was, lewin, s, interest, in, gestaltism, understanding, the, totality, and, assessing, a, situation, as, a, whole, and, not, focusing, only, on, individual, aspects, further, the, totality, for, an, individual, their, life, space, derives, from, their, perception, of, their, reality, not, an, objective, viewpoint, the, approach, developed, by, kurt, lewin, is, a, significant, contribution, to, the, fields, of, social, science, psychology, social, psychology, organizational, development, process, management, and, change, management, his, theory, was, expanded, by, john, r, p, french, who, related, it, to, organizational, and, industrial, settings, lewin, then, a, professor, at, mit, first, coined, the, term, action, research, in, about, 1944, and, it, appears, in, his, 1946, paper, action, research, and, minority, problems, in, that, paper, he, described, action, research, as, a, comparative, research, on, the, conditions, and, effects, of, various, forms, of, social, action, and, research, leading, to, social, action, that, uses, a, spiral, of, steps, each, of, which, is, composed, of, a, circle, of, planning, action, and, fact, finding, about, the, result, of, the, action, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, lewinian, spiral, lewin, often, characterized, organizational, management, styles, and, cultures, in, terms, of, leadership, climates, defined, by, 1, authoritarian, 2, democratic, and, 3, laissez, faire, work, environments, he, is, often, confused, with, mcgregor, with, his, work, environments, but, mcgregor, adapted, them, directly, to, leadership, theory, authoritarian, environments, are, characterized, where, the, leader, determines, policy, with, techniques, and, steps, for, work, tasks, dictated, by, the, leader, in, the, division, of, labor, the, leader, is, not, necessarily, hostile, but, is, aloof, from, participation, in, work, and, commonly, offers, personal, praise, and, criticism, for, the, work, done, democratic, climates, are, characterized, where, policy, is, determined, through, collective, processes, with, decisions, assisted, by, the, leader, before, accomplishing, tasks, perspectives, are, gained, from, group, discussion, and, technical, advice, from, a, leader, members, are, given, choices, and, collectively, decide, the, division, of, labor, praise, and, criticism, in, such, an, environment, are, objective, fact, minded, and, given, by, a, group, member, without, necessarily, having, participated, extensively, in, the, actual, work, laissez, faire, environments, give, freedom, to, the, group, for, policy, determination, without, any, participation, from, the, leader, the, leader, remains, uninvolved, in, work, decisions, unless, asked, does, not, participate, in, the, division, of, labor, and, very, infrequently, gives, praise, 39, 40, an, early, model, of, change, developed, by, lewin, described, change, as, a, three, stage, process, the, first, stage, he, called, unfreezing, it, involved, overcoming, inertia, and, dismantling, the, existing, mind, set, it, must, be, part, of, surviving, defense, mechanisms, have, to, be, bypassed, in, the, second, stage, the, change, occurs, this, is, typically, a, period, of, confusion, and, transition, we, are, aware, that, the, old, ways, are, being, challenged, but, we, do, not, have, a, clear, picture, as, to, what, we, are, replacing, them, with, yet, the, third, and, final, stage, he, called, freezing, the, new, mindset, is, crystallizing, and, one, s, comfort, level, is, returning, to, previous, levels, this, is, often, misquoted, as, refreezing, lewin, s, three, step, process, is, regarded, as, a, foundational, model, for, making, change, in, organizations, there, is, now, evidence, however, that, lewin, never, developed, such, a, model, and, that, it, took, form, after, his, death, in, 1947, while, working, at, mit, in, 1946, lewin, received, a, phone, call, from, the, director, of, the, connecticut, state, inter, racial, commission, which, requested, his, help, in, finding, an, effective, way, to, combat, religious, and, racial, prejudices, he, set, up, a, workshop, to, conduct, a, change, experiment, which, laid, the, foundations, for, what, is, now, known, as, sensitivity, training, in, 1947, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, national, training, laboratories, at, bethel, maine, carl, rogers, believed, that, sensitivity, training, is, perhaps, the, most, significant, social, invention, of, this, century, lewin, s, equation, b, p, e, s, psychological, equation, of, behavior, developed, by, lewin, states, that, behavior, is, a, function, of, the, person, in, their, environment, the, equation, is, the, psychologist, s, most, well, known, formula, in, social, psychology, of, which, lewin, was, a, modern, pioneer, when, first, presented, in, lewin, s, book, principles, of, topological, psychology, published, in, 1936, it, contradicted, most, popular, theories, in, that, it, gave, importance, to, a, person, s, momentary, situation, in, understanding, his, or, her, behavior, rather, than, relying, entirely, on, the, past, in, a, 1947, article, lewin, coined, the, term, group, dynamics, he, described, this, notion, as, the, way, that, groups, and, individuals, act, and, react, to, changing, circumstances, this, field, emerged, as, a, concept, dedicated, to, the, advancement, of, knowledge, regarding, the, nature, of, groups, their, laws, establishment, development, and, interactions, with, other, groups, individuals, and, institutions, during, the, early, years, of, research, on, group, processes, many, psychologists, rejected, the, reality, of, group, phenomena, critics, shared, the, opinion, that, groups, did, not, exist, as, scientifically, valid, entities, it, had, been, said, by, skeptics, that, the, actions, of, groups, were, nothing, more, than, those, of, its, members, considered, separately, lewin, applied, his, interactionism, formula, b, p, e, to, explain, group, phenomena, where, a, member, s, personal, characteristics, p, interact, with, the, environmental, factors, of, the, group, e, its, members, and, the, situation, to, elicit, behaviour, b, given, his, background, in, gestalt, psychology, lewin, justified, group, existence, using, the, dictum, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, he, theorized, that, when, a, group, is, established, it, becomes, a, unified, system, with, supervening, qualities, that, cannot, be, understood, by, evaluating, members, individually, this, notion, that, a, group, is, composed, of, more, than, the, sum, of, its, individual, members, quickly, gained, support, from, sociologists, and, psychologists, who, understood, the, significance, of, this, emerging, field, many, pioneers, noted, that, the, majority, of, group, phenomena, could, be, explained, according, to, lewin, s, equation, and, insight, and, opposing, views, were, hushed, the, study, of, group, dynamics, remains, relevant, in, today, s, society, where, a, vast, number, of, professions, e, g, business, and, industry, clinical, counseling, psychology, sports, and, recreation, rely, on, its, mechanisms, to, thrive, the, most, notable, of, lewin, s, contributions, was, his, development, of, group, communication, and, group, dynamics, as, major, facets, of, the, communication, discipline, lewin, and, his, associated, researchers, shifted, from, the, pre, existing, trend, of, individualist, psychology, and, then, expanded, their, work, to, incorporate, a, macro, lens, where, they, focused, on, the, social, psychology, of, small, group, communication, rogers, 1994, lewin, is, associated, with, founding, research, and, training, in, group, dynamics, and, for, establishing, the, participative, management, style, in, organizations, he, carved, out, this, niche, for, himself, from, his, various, experiments, in, his, berlin, research, lewin, utilized, group, discussions, to, advance, his, theory, in, research, in, doing, so, there, was, certainly, the, complication, of, not, knowing, exactly, whom, to, attribute, epiphanies, to, as, an, idea, collectively, came, into, fruition, in, addition, to, group, discussions, he, became, increasingly, interested, in, group, membership, he, was, curious, as, to, how, perspectives, of, an, individual, in, relation, to, the, group, were, solidified, or, weakened, he, tried, to, come, up, with, the, way, identity, was, constructed, from, standpoint, and, perspectives, these, were, the, beginnings, of, what, ended, up, developing, into, groupthink, lewin, started, to, become, quite, interested, in, how, ideas, were, created, and, then, perpetuated, by, the, mentality, of, a, group, not, included, in, this, chapter, is, how, important, this, became, in, looking, at, group, dynamics, across, disciplines, including, studying, john, f, kennedy, and, the, way, he, tried, to, interact, with, his, advisors, in, order, to, prevent, groupthink, from, occurring, lewin, conceived, the, peach, v, coconut, cultural, distinction, peach, cultures, included, india, the, u, s, most, of, latin, america, and, southern, europe, peaches, tend, to, be, soft, and, friendly, on, the, surface, even, with, strangers, but, have, a, hard, protective, inner, core, coconut, cultures, include, china, russia, and, most, of, europe, except, the, south, folk, from, coconut, cultures, have, a, soft, inner, core, but, a, tough, exterior, than, can, lead, to, a, perception, of, unfriendliness, with, strangers, yet, once, a, person, has, gained, their, trust, they, can, be, loyal, friends, for, life, the, peach, v, coconut, analogy, was, later, popularised, by, fons, trompenaars, who, said, it, explains, all, sorts, of, animosities, that, bedevil, cross, cultural, friendships, business, dealings, and, diplomacy, in, 1917, lewin, married, maria, landsberg, in, 1919, the, couple, had, a, daughter, esther, agnes, and, in, 1922, their, son, fritz, reuven, was, born, they, divorced, around, 1927, and, maria, immigrated, to, palestine, with, the, children, in, 1929, lewin, married, gertrud, weiss, their, daughter, miriam, was, born, in, 1931, and, their, son, daniel, was, born, in, 1933, in, 1947, lewin, died, of, heart, failure, in, newtonville, massachusetts, of, heart, failure, and, was, interred, in, mount, auburn, cemetery, in, cambridge, massachusetts, his, wife, died, in, 1987
