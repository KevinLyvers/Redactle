a, comic, troupe, however, in, his, autobiography, harpo, speaks, harpo, marx, stated, that, the, runaway, mule, incident, occurred, in, ada, oklahoma, a, 1930, article, in, the, san, antonio,

believed, to, be, the, only, time, that, all, five, marx, brothers, appeared, together, on, stage, gummo, then, left, to, serve, in, world, war, i, reasoning, that, anything, is, better, than, being, an, actor, zeppo, replaced, him, in, their, final, vaudeville, years, and, in, the, jump, to, broadway, and, then, to, paramount, films, during, world, war, i, anti, german, sentiments, were, common, and, the, family, tried, to, conceal, its, german, origin, upon, minnie, marx, learning, that, farmers, were, excluded, from, the, draft, she, purchased, a, 27, acre, 11, ha, poultry, farm, near, countryside, illinois, stefan, kanfer, wrote, that, each, night, rats, made, off, with, the, day, s, eggs, during, this, time, groucho, discontinued, his, german, stage, personality, in, 1917, the, selective, service, caught, up, with, marxes, and, each, was, rejected, except, gummo, who, was, drafted, he, spent, the, war, serving, in, illinois, following, this, zeppo, the, youngest, brother, joined, the, team, by, this, time, the, four, marx, brothers, had, begun, to, incorporate, their, unique, style, of, comedy, into, their, act, and, to, develop, their, characters, both, groucho, s, and, harpo, s, memoirs, say, that, their, now, famous, on, stage, personae, were, created, by, al, shean, groucho, began, to, wear, his, trademark, greasepaint, mustache, and, to, use, a, stooped, walk, harpo, stopped, speaking, onstage, and, began, to, wear, a, red, fright, wig, and, carry, a, taxi, cab, horn, chico, spoke, with, a, fake, italian, accent, developed, off, stage, to, deal, with, neighborhood, toughs, while, zeppo, adopted, the, role, of, the, romantic, and, peerlessly, cheesy, according, to, james, agee, straight, man, the, on, stage, personalities, of, groucho, chico, and, harpo, were, said, to, have, been, based, on, their, actual, traits, zeppo, on, the, other, hand, was, considered, the, funniest, brother, offstage, despite, his, straight, stage, roles, he, was, the, youngest, and, had, grown, up, watching, his, brothers, so, he, could, fill, in, for, and, imitate, any, of, the, others, when, illness, kept, them, from, performing, he, was, so, good, as, captain, spaulding, that, i, would, have, let, him, play, the, part, indefinitely, if, they, had, allowed, me, to, smoke, in, the, audience, groucho, recalled, zeppo, stood, in, for, groucho, in, the, film, version, of, animal, crackers, groucho, was, unavailable, to, film, the, scene, in, which, the, beaugard, painting, is, stolen, so, the, script, was, contrived, to, include, a, power, failure, which, allowed, zeppo, to, play, the, spaulding, part, in, near, darkness, in, december, 1917, the, marx, brothers, were, noted, in, an, advertisement, playing, in, a, musical, comedy, act, home, again, by, the, 1920s, the, marx, brothers, had, become, one, of, america, s, favorite, theatrical, acts, with, their, sharp, and, bizarre, sense, of, humor, they, satirized, high, society, and, human, hypocrisy, and, they, became, famous, for, their, improvisational, comedy, in, free, form, scenarios, a, famous, early, instance, was, when, harpo, arranged, to, chase, a, fleeing, chorus, girl, across, the, stage, during, the, middle, of, a, groucho, monolog, to, see, if, groucho, would, be, thrown, off, however, to, the, audience, s, delight, groucho, merely, reacted, by, commenting, first, time, i, ever, saw, a, taxi, hail, a, passenger, when, harpo, chased, the, girl, back, in, the, other, direction, groucho, calmly, checked, his, watch, and, ad, libbed, the, 9, 20, s, right, on, time, you, can, set, your, watch, by, the, lehigh, valley, the, brothers, vaudeville, act, had, made, them, stars, on, broadway, under, chico, s, management, and, with, groucho, s, creative, direction, with, the, musical, revue, i, ll, say, she, is, 1924, 1925, its, success, helped, secure, playwright, george, s, kaufman, and, songwriter, irving, berlin, two, of, broadway, s, best, talents, for, the, musical, comedy, the, cocoanuts, 1925, 1926, and, later, animal, crackers, 1928, 1929, out, of, their, distinctive, costumes, the, brothers, looked, alike, even, down, to, their, receding, hairlines, zeppo, could, pass, for, a, younger, groucho, and, played, the, role, of, groucho, s, son, in, horse, feathers, a, scene, in, duck, soup, finds, groucho, harpo, and, chico, all, appearing, in, the, famous, greasepaint, eyebrows, mustache, and, round, glasses, while, wearing, nightcaps, the, three, are, indistinguishable, enabling, them, to, carry, off, the, mirror, scene, perfectly, the, stage, names, of, the, brothers, except, zeppo, were, coined, by, monologist, art, fisher, during, a, poker, game, in, galesburg, illinois, based, both, on, the, brothers, personalities, and, gus, mager, s, sherlocko, the, monk, a, popular, comic, strip, of, the, day, that, included, a, supporting, character, named, groucho, as, fisher, dealt, each, brother, a, card, he, addressed, them, for, the, first, time, by, the, names, they, kept, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, the, reasons, behind, chico, s, and, harpo, s, stage, names, are, undisputed, and, gummo, s, is, fairly, well, established, groucho, s, and, zeppo, s, are, far, less, clear, arthur, was, named, harpo, because, he, played, the, harp, and, leonard, became, chico, pronounced, chick, o, because, he, was, in, the, slang, of, the, period, a, chicken, chaser, chickens, later, chicks, was, period, slang, for, women, in, england, now, said, groucho, they, were, called, birds, in, his, autobiography, harpo, explained, that, milton, became, gummo, because, he, crept, about, the, theater, like, a, gumshoe, detective, other, sources, reported, that, gummo, was, the, family, s, hypochondriac, having, been, the, sickliest, of, the, brothers, in, childhood, and, therefore, wore, rubber, overshoes, called, gumshoes, in, all, kinds, of, weather, still, others, reported, that, milton, was, the, troupe, s, best, dancer, and, dance, shoes, tended, to, have, rubber, soles, groucho, stated, that, the, source, of, the, name, was, gummo, wearing, galoshes, whatever, the, details, the, name, relates, to, rubber, soled, shoes, the, reason, that, julius, was, named, groucho, is, perhaps, the, most, disputed, there, are, three, explanations, i, kept, my, money, in, a, grouch, bag, this, was, a, small, chamois, bag, that, actors, used, to, wear, around, their, neck, to, keep, other, hungry, actors, from, pinching, their, dough, naturally, you, re, going, to, think, that, s, where, i, got, my, name, from, but, that, s, not, so, grouch, bags, were, worn, on, manly, chests, long, before, there, was, a, groucho, herbert, was, not, nicknamed, by, art, fisher, since, he, did, not, join, the, act, until, gummo, had, departed, as, with, groucho, three, explanations, exist, for, herbert, s, name, zeppo, maxine, marx, reported, in, the, unknown, marx, brothers, that, the, brothers, listed, their, real, names, julius, leonard, adolph, milton, and, herbert, on, playbills, and, in, programs, and, only, used, the, nicknames, behind, the, scenes, until, alexander, woollcott, overheard, them, calling, one, another, by, the, nicknames, he, asked, them, why, they, used, their, real, names, publicly, when, they, had, such, wonderful, nicknames, and, they, replied, that, wouldn, t, be, dignified, woollcott, answered, with, a, belly, laugh, woollcott, did, not, meet, the, marx, brothers, until, the, premiere, of, i, ll, say, she, is, which, was, their, first, broadway, show, so, this, would, mean, that, they, used, their, real, names, throughout, their, vaudeville, days, and, that, the, name, gummo, never, appeared, in, print, during, his, time, in, the, act, other, sources, reported, that, the, marx, brothers, went, by, their, nicknames, during, their, vaudeville, era, but, briefly, listed, themselves, by, their, given, names, when, i, ll, say, she, is, opened, because, they, were, worried, that, a, broadway, audience, would, reject, a, vaudeville, act, if, they, were, perceived, as, low, class, the, marx, brothers, stage, shows, became, popular, just, as, motion,

their, first, movie, not, based, on, a, stage, production, horse, feathers, 1932, in, which, the, brothers, satirized, the, american, college, system, and, prohibition, was, their, most, popular, film, yet, and, won, them, the, cover, of, time, magazine, it, included, a, running, gag, from, their, stage, work, in, which, harpo, produces, a, ludicrous, array, of, props, from, inside, his, coat, including, a, wooden, mallet, a, fish, a, coiled, rope, a, tie, a, poster, of, a, woman, in, her, underwear, a, cup, of, hot, coffee, a, sword, and, just, after, groucho, warns, him, that, he, can, t,
