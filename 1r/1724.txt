edward, jenner, frs, frcpe, 17, may, 1749, 26, january, 1823, was, an, english, physician, and, scientist, who, pioneered, the, concept, of, vaccines, and, created, the, smallpox, vaccine, the, world, s, first, vaccine, the, terms, vaccine, and, vaccination, are, derived, from, variolae, vaccinae, pustules, of, the, cow, the, term, devised, by, jenner, to, denote, cowpox, he, used, it, in, 1798, in, the, title, of, his, inquiry, into, the, variolae, vaccinae, known, as, the, cow, pox, in, which, he, described, the, protective, effect, of, cowpox, against, smallpox, in, the, west, jenner, is, often, called, the, father, of, immunology, and, his, work, is, said, to, have, saved, more, lives, than, any, other, man, 100, in, jenner, s, time, smallpox, killed, around, 10, of, the, global, population, with, the, number, as, high, as, 20, in, towns, and, cities, where, infection, spread, more, easily, in, 1821, he, was, appointed, physician, to, king, george, iv, and, was, also, made, mayor, of, berkeley, and, justice, of, the, peace, he, was, a, member, of, the, royal, society, in, the, field, of, zoology, he, was, among, the, first, modern, scholars, to, describe, the, brood, parasitism, of, the, cuckoo, aristotle, also, noted, this, behaviour, in, his, history, of, animals, in, 2002, jenner, was, named, in, the, bbc, s, list, of, the, 100, greatest, britons, edward, jenner, was, born, on, 17, may, 1749, in, berkeley, gloucestershire, england, as, the, eighth, of, nine, children, his, father, the, reverend, stephen, jenner, was, the, vicar, of, berkeley, so, jenner, received, a, strong, basic, education, when, he, was, young, he, went, to, school, in, wotton, under, edge, at, katherine, lady, berkeley, s, school, and, in, cirencester, during, this, time, he, was, inoculated, by, variolation, for, smallpox, which, had, a, lifelong, effect, upon, his, general, health, at, the, age, of, 14, he, was, apprenticed, for, seven, years, to, daniel, ludlow, a, surgeon, of, chipping, sodbury, south, gloucestershire, where, he, gained, most, of, the, experience, needed, to, become, a, surgeon, himself, in, 1770, aged, 21, jenner, became, apprenticed, in, surgery, and, anatomy, under, surgeon, john, hunter, and, others, at, st, george, s, hospital, london, william, osler, records, that, hunter, gave, jenner, william, harvey, s, advice, well, known, in, medical, circles, and, characteristic, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, don, t, think, try, hunter, remained, in, correspondence, with, jenner, over, natural, history, and, proposed, him, for, the, royal, society, returning, to, his, native, countryside, by, 1773, jenner, became, a, successful, family, doctor, and, surgeon, practising, on, dedicated, premises, at, berkeley, in, 1792, with, twenty, years, experience, of, general, practice, and, surgery, jenner, obtained, the, degree, of, md, from, the, university, of, st, andrews, jenner, and, others, formed, the, fleece, medical, society, or, gloucestershire, medical, society, so, called, because, it, met, in, the, parlour, of, the, fleece, inn, rodborough, gloucestershire, members, dined, together, and, read, papers, on, medical, subjects, jenner, contributed, papers, on, angina, pectoris, ophthalmia, and, cardiac, valvular, disease, and, commented, on, cowpox, he, also, belonged, to, a, similar, society, which, met, in, alveston, near, bristol, he, became, a, master, mason, on, 30, december, 1802, in, lodge, of, faith, and, friendship, 449, from, 1812, to, 1813, he, served, as, worshipful, master, of, royal, berkeley, lodge, of, faith, and, friendship, jenner, was, elected, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1788, following, his, publication, of, a, careful, study, of, the, previously, misunderstood, life, of, the, nested, cuckoo, a, study, that, combined, observation, experiment, and, dissection, jenner, described, how, the, newly, hatched, cuckoo, pushed, its, host, s, eggs, and, fledgling, chicks, out, of, the, nest, contrary, to, existing, belief, that, the, adult, cuckoo, did, it, having, observed, this, behaviour, jenner, demonstrated, an, anatomical, adaptation, for, it, the, baby, cuckoo, has, a, depression, in, its, back, not, present, after, 12, days, of, life, that, enables, it, to, cup, eggs, and, other, chicks, the, adult, does, not, remain, long, enough, in, the, area, to, perform, this, task, jenner, s, findings, were, published, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, in, 1788, the, singularity, of, its, shape, is, well, adapted, to, these, purposes, for, different, from, other, newly, hatched, birds, its, back, from, the, scapula, downwards, is, very, broad, with, a, considerable, depression, in, the, middle, this, depression, seems, formed, by, nature, for, the, design, of, giving, a, more, secure, lodgement, to, the, egg, of, the, hedge, sparrow, or, its, young, one, when, the, young, cuckoo, is, employed, in, removing, either, of, them, from, the, nest, when, it, is, about, twelve, days, old, this, cavity, is, quite, filled, up, and, then, the, back, assumes, the, shape, of, nestling, birds, in, general, jenner, s, nephew, assisted, in, the, study, he, was, born, on, 30, june, 1737, jenner, s, understanding, of, the, cuckoo, s, behaviour, was, not, entirely, believed, until, the, artist, jemima, blackburn, a, keen, observer, of, birdlife, saw, a, blind, nestling, pushing, out, a, host, s, egg, blackburn, s, description, and, illustration, were, enough, to, convince, charles, darwin, to, revise, a, later, edition, of, on, the, origin, of, species, jenner, s, interest, in, zoology, played, a, large, role, in, his, first, experiment, with, inoculation, not, only, did, he, have, a, profound, understanding, of, human, anatomy, due, to, his, medical, training, but, he, also, understood, animal, biology, and, its, role, in, human, animal, trans, species, boundaries, in, disease, transmission, at, the, time, there, was, no, way, of, knowing, how, important, this, connection, would, be, to, the, history, and, discovery, of, vaccinations, we, see, this, connection, now, many, present, day, vaccinations, include, animal, parts, from, cows, rabbits, and, chicken, eggs, which, can, be, attributed, to, the, work, of, jenner, and, his, cowpox, smallpox, vaccination, jenner, married, catherine, kingscote, who, died, in, 1815, from, tuberculosis, in, march, 1788, he, might, have, met, her, while, he, and, other, fellows, were, experimenting, with, balloons, jenner, s, trial, balloon, descended, into, kingscote, park, gloucestershire, owned, by, catherine, s, father, anthony, kingscote, they, had, three, children, edward, robert, 1789, 1810, robert, fitzharding, 1792, 1854, and, catherine, 1794, 1833, he, earned, his, md, from, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, 1792, he, is, credited, with, advancing, the, understanding, of, angina, pectoris, in, his, correspondence, with, heberden, he, wrote, how, much, the, heart, must, suffer, from, the, coronary, arteries, not, being, able, to, perform, their, functions, inoculation, was, already, a, standard, practice, in, asian, and, african, medicine, but, involved, serious, risks, including, the, possibility, that, those, inoculated, would, become, contagious, and, spread, the, disease, to, others, in, 1721, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, had, imported, variolation, to, britain, after, having, observed, it, in, istanbul, while, johnnie, notions, had, great, success, with, his, self, devised, inoculation, and, was, reputed, not, to, have, lost, a, single, patient, his, method, s, practice, was, limited, to, the, shetland, isles, voltaire, wrote, that, at, this, time, 60, of, the, population, caught, smallpox, and, 20, of, the, population, died, from, it, voltaire, also, states, that, the, circassians, used, the, inoculation, from, times, immemorial, and, the, custom, may, have, been, borrowed, by, the, turks, from, the, circassians, in, 1766, daniel, bernoulli, analysed, smallpox, morbidity, and, mortality, data, to, demonstrate, the, efficacy, of, inoculation, by, 1768, english, physician, john, fewster, had, realised, that, prior, infection, with, cowpox, rendered, a, person, immune, to, smallpox, in, the, years, following, 1770, at, least, five, investigators, in, england, and, germany, sevel, jensen, jesty, 1774, rendell, plett, 1791, successfully, tested, in, humans, a, cowpox, vaccine, against, smallpox, for, example, dorset, farmer, benjamin, jesty, successfully, vaccinated, and, presumably, induced, immunity, with, cowpox, in, his, wife, and, two, children, during, a, smallpox, epidemic, in, 1774, but, it, was, not, until, jenner, s, work, that, the, procedure, became, widely, understood, jenner, may, have, been, aware, of, jesty, s, procedures, and, success, a, similar, observation, was, later, made, in, france, by, jacques, antoine, rabaut, pommier, in, 1780, jenner, postulated, that, the, pus, in, the, blisters, that, affected, individuals, affected, by, cowpox, a, disease, similar, to, smallpox, but, much, less, virulent, protected, them, from, smallpox, on, 14, may, 1796, jenner, tested, his, hypothesis, by, inoculating, james, phipps, an, eight, year, old, boy, who, was, the, son, of, jenner, s, gardener, he, scraped, pus, from, cowpox, blisters, on, the, hands, of, sarah, nelmes, a, milkmaid, who, had, caught, cowpox, from, a, cow, called, blossom, whose, hide, now, hangs, on, the, wall, of, the, st, george, s, medical, school, library, now, in, tooting, phipps, was, the, 17th, case, described, in, jenner, s, first, paper, on, vaccination, jenner, inoculated, phipps, in, both, arms, that, day, subsequently, producing, in, phipps, a, fever, and, some, uneasiness, but, no, full, blown, infection, later, he, injected, phipps, with, variolous, material, the, routine, method, of, immunization, at, that, time, no, disease, followed, the, boy, was, later, challenged, with, variolous, material, and, again, showed, no, sign, of, infection, no, unexpected, side, effects, occurred, and, neither, phipps, nor, any, other, recipients, underwent, any, future, breakthrough, cases, jenner, s, biographer, john, baron, would, later, speculate, that, jenner, understood, one, could, be, inoculated, against, smallpox, by, being, exposed, to, cowpox, by, observing, the, unblemished, complexion, of, milkmaids, rather, than, building, on, the, work, of, his, predecessors, the, milkmaids, story, is, still, widely, repeated, even, though, it, appears, to, be, a, myth, donald, hopkins, has, written, jenner, s, unique, contribution, was, not, that, he, inoculated, a, few, persons, with, cowpox, but, that, he, then, proved, that, they, were, immune, to, smallpox, moreover, he, demonstrated, that, the, protective, cowpox, pus, could, be, effectively, inoculated, from, person, to, person, not, just, directly, from, cattle, jenner, successfully, tested, his, hypothesis, on, 23, additional, subjects, jenner, continued, his, research, and, reported, it, to, the, royal, society, which, did, not, publish, the, initial, paper, after, revisions, and, further, investigations, he, published, his, findings, on, the, 23, cases, including, his, 11, month, old, son, robert, some, of, his, conclusions, were, correct, some, erroneous, modern, microbiological, and, microscopic, methods, would, make, his, studies, easier, to, reproduce, the, medical, establishment, deliberated, at, length, over, his, findings, before, accepting, them, eventually, vaccination, was, accepted, and, in, 1840, the, british, government, banned, variolation, the, use, of, smallpox, to, induce, immunity, and, provided, vaccination, using, cowpox, free, of, charge, see, vaccination, act, the, success, of, his, discovery, soon, spread, around, europe, and, was, used, en, masse, in, the, spanish, balmis, expedition, 1803, 1806, a, three, year, long, mission, to, the, americas, the, philippines, macao, china, led, by, francisco, javier, de, balmis, with, the, aim, of, giving, thousands, the, smallpox, vaccine, the, expedition, was, successful, and, jenner, wrote, i, don, t, imagine, the, annals, of, history, furnish, an, example, of, philanthropy, so, noble, so, extensive, as, this, napoleon, who, at, the, time, was, at, war, with, britain, had, all, his, french, troops, vaccinated, awarded, jenner, a, medal, and, at, the, request, of, jenner, he, released, two, english, prisoners, of, war, and, permitted, their, return, home, napoleon, remarked, he, could, not, refuse, anything, to, one, of, the, greatest, benefactors, of, mankind, jenner, s, continuing, work, on, vaccination, prevented, him, from, continuing, his, ordinary, medical, practice, he, was, supported, by, his, colleagues, and, the, king, in, petitioning, parliament, and, was, granted, 10, 000, in, 1802, for, his, work, on, vaccination, in, 1807, he, was, granted, another, 20, 000, after, the, royal, college, of, physicians, confirmed, the, widespread, efficacy, of, vaccination, jenner, was, later, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1802, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1804, and, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1806, in, 1803, in, london, he, became, president, of, the, jennerian, society, concerned, with, promoting, vaccination, to, eradicate, smallpox, the, jennerian, ceased, operations, in, 1809, jenner, became, a, member, of, the, medical, and, chirurgical, society, on, its, founding, in, 1805, now, the, royal, society, of, medicine, and, presented, several, papers, there, in, 1808, with, government, aid, the, national, vaccine, establishment, was, founded, but, jenner, felt, dishonoured, by, the, men, selected, to, run, it, and, resigned, his, directorship, 122, 125, returning, to, london, in, 1811, jenner, observed, a, significant, number, of, cases, of, smallpox, after, vaccination, he, found, that, in, these, cases, the, severity, of, the, illness, was, notably, diminished, by, previous, vaccination, in, 1821, he, was, appointed, physician, extraordinary, to, king, george, iv, and, was, also, made, mayor, of, berkeley, and, magistrate, 303, justice, of, the, peace, he, continued, to, investigate, natural, history, and, in, 1823, the, last, year, of, his, life, he, presented, his, observations, on, the, migration, of, birds, to, the, royal, society, jenner, was, a, freemason, jenner, was, found, in, a, state, of, apoplexy, on, 25, january, 1823, with, his, right, side, paralysed, 314, he, did, not, recover, and, died, the, next, day, of, an, apparent, stroke, his, second, on, 26, january, 1823, aged, 73, he, was, buried, in, the, family, vault, at, the, church, of, st, mary, berkeley, neither, fanatic, nor, lax, jenner, was, a, christian, who, in, his, personal, correspondence, showed, himself, quite, spiritual, 141, some, days, before, his, death, he, stated, to, a, friend, i, am, not, surprised, that, men, are, not, grateful, to, me, but, i, wonder, that, they, are, not, grateful, to, god, for, the, good, which, he, has, made, me, the, instrument, of, conveying, to, my, fellow, creatures, 295, in, 1980, the, world, health, organization, declared, smallpox, an, eradicated, disease, this, was, the, result, of, coordinated, public, health, efforts, but, vaccination, was, an, essential, component, although, the, disease, was, declared, eradicated, some, pus, samples, still, remain, in, laboratories, in, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, atlanta, in, the, us, and, in, state, research, center, of, virology, and, biotechnology, vector, in, koltsovo, novosibirsk, oblast, russia, jenner, s, vaccine, laid, the, foundation, for, contemporary, discoveries, in, immunology, in, 2002, jenner, was, named, in, the, bbc, s, list, of, the, 100, greatest, britons, following, a, uk, wide, vote, commemorated, on, postage, stamps, issued, by, the, royal, mail, in, 1999, he, featured, in, their, world, changers, issue, along, with, charles, darwin, michael, faraday, and, alan, turing, the, lunar, crater, jenner, is, named, in, his, honour
