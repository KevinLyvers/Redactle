the, roman, school, with, orlande, de, lassus, and, tom, s, luis, de, victoria, palestrina, is, considered, the, leading, composer, of, late, 16th, century, europe, primarily, known, for, his, masses, and, motets, which, number, over, 105, and, 250, respectively, palestrina, had, a, long, lasting, influence, on, the, development, of, church, and, secular, music, in, europe, especially, on, the, development, of, counterpoint, according, to, grove, music, online, palestrina, s, success, in, reconciling, the, functional, and, aesthetic, aims, of, catholic, church, music, in, the, post, tridentine, period, earned, him, an, enduring, reputation, as, the, ideal, catholic, composer, as, well, as, giving, his, style, or, more, precisely, later, generations, selective, view, of, it, an, iconic, stature, as, a, model, of, perfect, achievement, palestrina, was, born, in, the, town, of, palestrina, near, rome, then, part, of, the, papal, states, to, neapolitan, parents, santo, and, palma, pierluigi, in, 1525, possibly, on, 3, february, his, mother, died, on, 16, january, 1536, when, palestrina, was, 10, documents, suggest, that, he, first, visited, rome, in, 1537, when, he, was, listed, as, a, chorister, at, the, basilica, of, santa, maria, maggiore, one, of, the, papal, basilicas, of, the, diocese, of, rome, which, allowed, him, to, learn, literature, and, music, in, 1540, he, moved, to, rome, where, he, studied, in, the, school, of, the, huguenot, claude, goudimel, he, also, studied, with, robin, mallapert, and, firmin, lebel, he, spent, most, of, his, career, in, the, city, palestrina, came, of, age, as, a, musician, under, the, influence, of, the, northern, european, style, of, polyphony, which, owed, its, dominance, in, italy, primarily, to, two, influential, netherlandish, composers, guillaume, du, fay, and, josquin, des, prez, who, had, spent, significant, portions, of, their, careers, there, italy, itself, had, yet, to, produce, anyone, of, comparable, fame, or, skill, in, polyphony, orlando, di, lasso, who, accompanied, palestrina, in, his, early, years, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, formation, of, his, style, as, an, adviser, from, 1544, to, 1551, palestrina, was, the, organist, of, the, cathedral, of, st, agapito, the, principal, church, of, his, native, city, in, 1551, pope, julius, iii, previously, the, bishop, of, palestrina, appointed, palestrina, maestro, di, cappella, or, musical, director, of, the, cappella, giulia, julian, chapel, in, the, sense, of, choir, the, choir, of, the, chapter, of, canons, at, st, peter, s, basilica, palestrina, dedicated, to, julius, iii, his, first, published, compositions, 1554, a, book, of, masses, it, was, the, first, book, of, masses, by, a, native, composer, since, in, the, italian, states, of, palestrina, s, day, most, composers, of, sacred, music, were, from, the, low, countries, france, or, spain, in, fact, the, book, was, modelled, on, one, by, crist, bal, de, morales, the, woodcut, in, the, front, is, almost, an, exact, copy, of, the, one, from, the, book, by, the, spanish, composer, in, 1555, pope, paul, iv, ordered, that, all, papal, choristers, should, be, clerical, as, palestrina, married, early, in, life, and, had, four, children, he, was, unable, to, continue, in, the, chapel, as, a, layman, during, the, next, decade, palestrina, held, positions, similar, to, his, julian, chapel, appointment, at, other, chapels, and, churches, in, rome, notably, st, john, lateran, 1555, 1560, a, post, previously, held, by, lassus, and, santa, maria, maggiore, 1561, 1566, in, 1571, he, returned, to, the, julian, chapel, and, remained, at, st, peter, s, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, decade, of, the, 1570s, was, difficult, for, him, personally, he, lost, his, brother, two, of, his, sons, and, his, wife, lucrezia, gori, in, three, separate, outbreaks, of, the, plague, 1572, 1575, and, 1580, respectively, he, seems, to, have, considered, becoming, a, priest, at, this, time, but, instead, he, remarried, this, time, to, a, wealthy, widow, virginia, dormoli, this, finally, gave, him, financial, independence, he, was, not, paid, well, as, choirmaster, and, was, able, to, compose, prolifically, until, his, death, he, died, in, rome, of, pleurisy, on, 2, february, 1594, as, was, usual, palestrina, was, buried, on, the, same, day, he, died, in, a, plain, coffin, with, a, lead, plate, on, which, was, inscribed, ioannes, petrus, aloysius, praenestinus, musicae, princeps, a, five, part, libera, me, domine, psalm, for, three, choirs, was, sung, at, the, funeral, palestrina, s, funeral, was, held, at, st, peter, s, and, he, was, buried, beneath, the, floor, of, the, basilica, his, tomb, was, later, covered, by, new, construction, and, attempts, to, locate, his, grave, have, been, unsuccessful, italian, composers, giovanni, maria, nanino, and, gregorio, allegri, both, of, them, disciples, of, his, school, continued, his, works, palestrina, left, hundreds, of, compositions, including, 105, masses, 68, offertories, at, least, 140, madrigals, and, more, than, 300, motets, in, addition, there, are, at, least, 72, hymns, 35, magnificats, 11, litanies, and, four, or, five, sets, of, lamentations, the, gloria, melody, from, palestrina, s, magnificat, tertii, toni, 1591, is, widely, used, today, in, the, resurrection, hymn, tune, victory, the, strife, is, o, er, his, attitude, toward, madrigals, was, somewhat, enigmatic, whereas, in, the, preface, to, his, collection, of, canticum, canticorum, song, of, songs, motets, 1584, he, renounced, the, setting, of, profane, texts, only, two, years, later, he, was, back, in, print, with, book, ii, of, his, secular, madrigals, some, of, these, being, among, the, finest, compositions, in, the, medium, he, published, just, two, collections, of, madrigals, with, profane, texts, one, in, 1555, and, another, in, 1586, the, other, two, collections, were, spiritual, madrigals, a, genre, beloved, by, the, proponents, of, the, counter, reformation, palestrina, s, masses, show, how, his, compositional, style, developed, over, time, his, missa, sine, nomine, seems, to, have, been, particularly, attractive, to, johann, sebastian, bach, who, studied, and, performed, it, while, writing, the, mass, in, b, minor, most, of, palestrina, s, masses, appeared, in, thirteen, volumes, printed, between, 1554, and, 1601, the, last, seven, published, after, his, death, one, of, his, most, important, works, the, missa, papae, marcelli, pope, marcellus, mass, has, been, historically, associated, with, erroneous, information, involving, the, council, of, trent, according, to, this, tale, which, forms, the, basis, of, hans, pfitzner, s, opera, palestrina, it, was, composed, in, order, to, persuade, the, council, of, trent, that, a, draconian, ban, on, the, polyphonic, treatment, of, text, in, sacred, music, as, opposed, that, is, to, a, more, directly, intelligible, homophonic, treatment, was, unnecessary, however, more, recent, scholarship, shows, that, this, mass, was, in, fact, composed, before, the, cardinals, convened, to, discuss, the, ban, possibly, as, much, as, 10, years, before, historical, data, indicates, that, the, council, of, trent, as, an, official, body, never, actually, banned, any, church, music, and, failed, to, make, any, ruling, or, official, statement, on, the, subject, these, stories, originated, from, the, unofficial, points, of, view, of, some, council, attendees, who, discussed, their, ideas, with, those, not, privy, to, the, council, s, deliberations, those, opinions, and, rumors, have, over, centuries, been, transmuted, into, fictional, accounts, put, into, print, and, often, incorrectly, taught, as, historical, fact, while, palestrina, s, compositional, motivations, are, not, known, he, may, have, been, quite, conscious, of, the, need, for, intelligible, text, however, this, was, not, to, conform, with, any, doctrine, of, the, counter, reformation, because, no, such, doctrine, exists, his, characteristic, style, remained, consistent, from, the, 1560s, until, the, end, of, his, life, roche, s, hypothesis, that, palestrina, s, seemingly, dispassionate, approach, to, expressive, or, emotive, texts, could, have, resulted, from, his, having, to, produce, many, to, order, or, from, a, deliberate, decision, that, any, intensity, of, expression, was, unbecoming, in, church, music, reflects, modern, expectations, about, expressive, freedom, and, underestimates, the, extent, to, which, the, mood, of, palestrina, s, settings, is, adapted, to, the, liturgical, occasions, for, which, the, texts, were, set, rather, than, the, line, by, line, meaning, of, the, text, and, depends, on, the, distinctive, characters, of, the, church, modes, and, variations, in, vocal, grouping, for, expressive, effect, performing, editions, and, recordings, of, palestrina, have, tended, to, favour, his, works, in, the, more, familiar, modes, and, standard, satb, voicings, under, representing, the, expressive, variety, of, his, settings, there, are, two, comprehensive, editions, of, palestrina, s, works, a, 33, volume, edition, published, by, breitkopf, and, h, rtel, in, leipzig, germany, between, 1862, and, 1894, edited, by, franz, xaver, haberl, and, a, 34, volume, edition, published, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, by, fratelli, scalera, in, rome, italy, edited, by, r, casimiri, and, others, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, palestrina, s, music, is, that, dissonances, are, typically, relegated, to, the, weak, beats, in, a, measure, this, produced, a, smoother, and, more, consonant, type, of, polyphony, which, is, now, considered, to, be, definitive, of, late, renaissance, music, given, palestrina, s, position, as, europe, s, leading, composer, in, the, wake, of, josquin, des, prez, d, 1521, the, palestrina, style, taught, in, college, courses, covering, renaissance, counterpoint, is, often, based, on, the, codification, by, the, 18th, century, composer, and, theorist, johann, joseph, fux, published, as, gradus, ad, parnassum, steps, to, parnassus, 1725, citing, palestrina, as, his, model, fux, divided, counterpoint, into, five, species, hence, the, term, species, counterpoint, designed, as, exercises, for, the, student, which, deployed, progressively, more, elaborate, rhythmic, combinations, of, voices, while, adhering, to, strict, harmonic, and, melodic, requirements, the, method, was, widely, adopted, and, was, the, main, basis, of, contrapuntal, training, in, the, 19th, century, but, fux, had, introduced, a, number, of, simplifications, to, the, palestrina, style, notably, the, obligatory, use, of, a, cantus, firmus, in, semibreves, which, were, corrected, by, later, authors, such, as, knud, jeppesen, and, r, o, morris, palestrina, s, music, conforms, in, many, ways, to, fux, s, rules, particularly, in, the, fifth, species, but, does, not, fit, his, pedagogical, format, the, main, insight, that, the, pure, style, of, polyphony, achieved, by, palestrina, followed, an, invariable, set, of, stylistic, and, combinational, requirements, was, justified, fux, s, manual, was, endorsed, by, his, contemporary, j, s, bach, who, himself, arranged, two, of, palestrina, s, masses, for, performance, according, to, fux, palestrina, had, established, and, followed, these, basic, guidelines, fux, omits, to, mention, the, manner, in, which, the, musical, phrasing, of, palestrina, followed, the, syntax, of, the, sentences, he, was, setting, to, music, something, not, always, observed, by, earlier, composers, also, to, be, noticed, in, palestrina, is, a, great, deal, of, tone, painting, elementary, examples, of, this, are, descending, musical, motion, with, latin, words, like, descendit, descends, or, of, a, static, musical, or, cadential, moment, with, the, words, de, coelis, from, heaven, palestrina, was, extremely, famous, in, his, day, and, if, anything, his, reputation, and, influence, increased, after, his, death, j, s, bach, studied, and, hand, copied, palestrina, s, first, book, of, masses, and, in, 1742, wrote, his, own, adaptation, of, the, kyrie, and, gloria, of, the, missa, sine, nomine, felix, mendelssohn, placed, him, in, the, pantheon, of, the, greatest, musicians, writing, i, always, get, upset, when, some, praise, only, beethoven, others, only, palestrina, and, still, others, only, mozart, or, bach, all, four, of, them, i, say, or, none, at, all, conservative, music, of, the, roman, school, continued, to, be, written, in, palestrina, s, style, which, in, the, 17th, century, came, to, be, known, as, the, prima, prattica, by, such, students, of, his, as, giovanni, maria, nanino, ruggiero, giovanelli, arcangelo, crivelli, teofilo, gargari, francesco, soriano, and, gregorio, allegri, as, late, as, the, 1750s, palestrina, s, style, was, still, the, reference, for, composers, working, in, the, motet, form, as, can, be, seen, by, francesco, barsanti, s, sei, antifones, in, the, style, of, palestrina, c, 1750, published, by, welcker, c, 1762, much, research, on, palestrina, was, done, in, the, 19th, century, by, giuseppe, baini, who, published, a, monograph, in, 1828, which, made, palestrina, famous, again, and, reinforced, the, already, existing, legend, that, he, was, the, saviour, of, church, music, during, the, reforms, of, the, council, of, trent, 20th, and, 21st, century, scholarship, by, and, large, retains, the, view, that, palestrina, was, a, strong, and, refined, composer, whose, music, represents, a, summit, of, technical, perfection, contemporary, analysis, highlighted, the, modern, qualities, in, the, compositions, of, palestrina, such, as, research, of, color, and, sonority, use, of, sonic, grouping, in, large, scale, setting, interest, in, vertical, as, well, as, horizontal, organization, studied, attention, to, text, setting, these, unique, characteristics, together, with, effortless, delivery, and, an, indefinable, otherness, constitute, to, this, day, the, attraction, of, palestrina, s, work, the, cagliari, music, conservatory, in, cagliari, italy, is, named, in, his, honor, in, 2009, a, film, about, the, composer, was, produced, by, german, television, zdf, arte, title, palestrina, prince, of, music, directed, by, georg,
