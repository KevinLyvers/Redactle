of, further, taxation, in, april, 1182, partially, to, enrich, the, french, crown, he, expelled, all, jews, from, the, demesne, and, confiscated, their, goods, philip, expelled, them, from, the,

return, in, 1181, a, conflict, arose, between, philip, and, count, philip, i, of, flanders, over, the, vermandois, which, king, philip, claimed, as, his, wife, s, dowry, finally, the, count, of, flanders, invaded, france, ravaging, the, whole, district, between, the, somme, and, the, oise, before, penetrating, as, far, as, dammartin, notified, of, philip, s, approach, with, 2, 000, knights, he, headed, back, to, flanders, philip, chased, him, and, the, two, armies, confronted, each, other, near, amiens, by, this, stage, philip, had, managed, to, counter, the, ambitions, of, the, count, by, breaking, his, alliances, with, duke, henry, i, of, brabant, and, the, archbishop, of, cologne, philipp, von, heinsberg, this, together, with, an, uncertain, outcome, were, he, to, engage, the, french, in, battle, forced, the, count, to, conclude, a, peace, in, july, 1185, the, treaty, of, boves, left, the, disputed, territory, partitioned, with, ami, nois, artois, and, numerous, other, places, passing, to, the, king, and, the, remainder, with, the, county, of, vermandois, proper, left, provisionally, to, the, count, of, flanders, it, was, during, this, time, that, philip, ii, was, nicknamed, augustus, by, the, monk, rigord, for, augmenting, french, lands, meanwhile, in, 1184, stephen, i, count, of, sancerre, and, his, braban, on, mercenaries, ravaged, the, orl, anais, philip, defeated, him, with, the, aid, of, the, confr, res, de, la, paix, a, disagreement, arose, between, philip, and, king, henry, ii, of, england, who, was, also, count, of, anjou, and, duke, of, normandy, and, aquitaine, in, france, the, death, of, henry, s, eldest, son, henry, the, young, king, in, june, 1183, began, a, dispute, over, the, dowry, of, philip, s, widowed, sister, margaret, philip, insisted, that, the, dowry, should, be, returned, to, france, as, the, marriage, did, not, produce, any, children, per, the, betrothal, agreement, the, two, kings, would, hold, conferences, at, the, foot, of, an, elm, tree, near, gisors, which, was, so, positioned, that, it, would, overshadow, each, monarch, s, territory, but, to, no, avail, philip, pushed, the, case, further, when, king, b, la, iii, of, hungary, asked, for, the, widow, s, hand, in, marriage, and, thus, her, dowry, had, to, be, returned, to, which, henry, finally, agreed, the, death, of, henry, s, fourth, son, geoffrey, ii, duke, of, brittany, began, a, new, round, of, disputes, as, henry, insisted, that, he, retain, the, guardianship, of, the, duchy, for, his, unborn, grandson, arthur, i, duke, of, brittany, philip, as, henry, s, liege, lord, objected, stating, that, he, should, be, the, rightful, guardian, until, the, birth, of, the, child, philip, then, raised, the, issue, of, his, other, sister, alys, countess, of, vexin, and, her, delayed, betrothal, to, henry, s, son, richard, i, of, england, nicknamed, richard, the, lionheart, with, these, grievances, two, years, of, combat, followed, 1186, 1188, but, the, situation, remained, unchanged, philip, initially, allied, with, henry, s, young, sons, richard, the, lionheart, and, john, who, were, in, rebellion, against, their, father, philip, ii, launched, an, attack, on, berry, in, the, summer, of, 1187, but, by, june, made, a, truce, with, henry, which, left, issoudun, in, philip, s, hands, while, also, granting, him, fr, teval, in, vend, mois, though, the, truce, was, for, two, years, philip, found, grounds, for, resuming, hostilities, in, the, summer, of, 1188, he, skillfully, exploited, the, estrangement, between, henry, and, richard, and, richard, did, homage, to, him, voluntarily, at, bonsmoulins, in, november, 1188, in, 1189, as, henry, s, health, was, failing, richard, openly, joined, forces, with, philip, to, drive, him, into, submission, they, chased, him, from, le, mans, to, saumur, losing, tours, in, the, process, before, forcing, him, to, acknowledge, richard, as, his, heir, finally, by, the, treaty, of, azay, le, rideau, 4, july, 1189, henry, was, forced, to, renew, his, own, homage, confirm, the, cession, of, issoudun, to, philip, along, with, gra, ay, and, renounce, his, claim, to, suzerainty, over, auvergne, henry, died, two, days, later, his, death, and, the, news, of, the, fall, of, jerusalem, to, saladin, diverted, attention, from, the, franco, english, war, the, angevin, kings, of, england, the, line, of, rulers, to, which, henry, ii, belonged, were, philip, s, most, powerful, and, dangerous, vassals, as, dukes, of, normandy, and, aquitaine, and, counts, of, anjou, philip, made, it, his, life, s, work, to, destroy, angevin, s, power, in, france, one, of, his, most, effective, tools, was, to, befriend, all, of, henry, s, sons, and, use, them, to, foment, rebellion, against, their, father, he, maintained, friendships, with, henry, the, young, king, and, geoffrey, duke, of, brittany, until, their, deaths, indeed, at, geoffrey, s, funeral, he, was, so, overcome, with, grief, that, he, had, to, be, forcibly, restrained, from, casting, himself, into, the, grave, he, broke, off, his, friendships, with, henry, s, other, sons, richard, and, john, as, each, ascended, to, the, english, throne, philip, travelled, to, the, holy, land, to, participate, in, the, third, crusade, of, 1189, 1192, with, king, richard, i, of, england, and, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, i, barbarossa, leaving, v, zelay, with, his, army, on, 4, july, 1190, at, first, the, french, and, english, crusaders, travelled, together, but, the, armies, split, at, lyon, after, richard, decided, to, go, by, sea, from, marseille, whereas, philip, took, the, overland, route, through, the, alps, to, genoa, the, french, and, english, armies, were, reunited, in, messina, where, they, wintered, together, on, 30, march, 1191, the, french, set, sail, for, the, holy, land, and, on, 20, april, philip, arrived, at, acre, which, was, already, under, siege, by, a, lesser, contingent, of, crusaders, and, he, started, to, construct, siege, equipment, before, richard, arrived, on, 8, june, by, the, time, acre, surrendered, on, 12, july, philip, was, severely, ill, with, dysentery, which, reduced, his, zeal, ties, with, richard, were, further, strained, after, the, latter, acted, in, a, haughty, manner, after, acre, fell, to, the, crusaders, more, importantly, the, siege, of, acre, resulted, in, the, death, of, philip, count, of, flanders, who, held, the, county, of, vermandois, proper, his, death, threatened, to, derail, the, treaty, of, gisors, that, philip, had, orchestrated, to, isolate, the, powerful, blois, champagne, faction, philip, decided, to, return, to, france, to, settle, the, issue, of, succession, in, flanders, a, decision, that, displeased, richard, who, said, it, is, a, shame, and, a, disgrace, on, my, lord, if, he, goes, away, without, having, finished, the, business, that, brought, him, hither, but, still, if, he, finds, himself, in, bad, health, or, is, afraid, lest, he, should, die, here, his, will, be, done, on, 31, july, 1191, the, french, army, of, 10, 000, men, along, with, 5, 000, silver, marks, to, pay, the, soldiers, remained, in, outremer, under, the, command, of, duke, hugh, iii, of, burgundy, philip, and, his, cousin, peter, of, courtenay, count, of, nevers, made, their, way, to, rome, where, philip, protested, to, pope, celestine, iii, to, no, avail, of, richard, s, abusive, manner, and, from, there, returned, to, france, the, decision, to, return, was, also, fuelled, by, the, realization, that, with, richard, campaigning, in, the, holy, land, english, possessions, in, northern, france, would, be, open, to, attack, after, richard, s, delayed, return, home, the, war, between, england, and, france, would, ensue, over, the, possession, of, english, controlled, territories, the, immediate, cause, of, philip, s, conflict, with, richard, the, lionheart, stemmed, from, richard, s, decision, to, break, his, betrothal, with, philip, s, sister, alys, at, messina, in, 1191, some, of, alys, s, dowry, that, had, been, given, over, to, richard, during, their, engagement, was, part, of, the, territory, of, vexin, this, should, have, reverted, to, philip, upon, the, end, of, the, betrothal, but, philip, to, prevent, the, collapse, of, the, crusade, agreed, that, this, territory, was, to, remain, in, richard, s, hands, and, would, be, inherited, by, his, male, descendants, should, richard, die, without, an, heir, the, territory, would, return, to, philip, and, if, philip, died, without, an, heir, those, lands, would, be, considered, a, part, of, normandy, returning, to, france, in, late, 1191, philip, began, plotting, to, find, a, way, to, have, those, territories, restored, to, him, he, was, in, a, difficult, situation, as, he, had, taken, an, oath, not, to, attack, richard, s, lands, while, he, was, away, on, a, crusade, the, third, crusade, ordained, territory, under, the, protection, of, the, church, in, any, event, philip, was, unsuccessful, in, requesting, a, release, from, his, oath, from, pope, celestine, iii, so, he, was, forced, to, build, his, own, casus, belli, on, 20, january, 1192, philip, met, with, william, fitzralph, richard, s, seneschal, for, normandy, presenting, some, documents, purporting, to, be, from, richard, philip, claimed, that, the, english, king, had, agreed, at, messina, to, hand, disputed, lands, over, to, france, not, having, heard, anything, directly, from, their, sovereign, fitzralph, and, the, norman, barons, rejected, philip, s, claim, to, vexin, philip, at, this, time, also, began, spreading, rumors, about, richard, s, action, in, the, east, to, discredit, the, english, king, in, the, eyes, of, his, subjects, among, the, stories, philip, invented, included, richard, being, involved, in, treacherous, communication, with, saladin, alleging, he, had, conspired, to, cause, the, fall, of, gaza, jaffa, and, ascalon, and, that, he, had, participated, in, the, murder, of, conrad, of, montferrat, finally, philip, made, contact, with, john, richard, s, brother, whom, he, convinced, to, join, the, conspiracy, to, overthrow, the, legitimate, king, of, england, at, the, start, of, 1193, john, visited, philip, in, paris, where, he, paid, homage, for, richard, s, continental, lands, when, word, reached, philip, that, richard, had, finished, crusading, and, had, been, captured, on, his, way, back, from, the, holy, land, he, promptly, invaded, vexin, his, first, target, was, the, fortress, of, gisors, commanded, by, gilbert, de, vascoeuil, which, surrendered, without, putting, up, a, struggle, philip, then, penetrated, deep, into, normandy, reaching, as, far, as, dieppe, to, keep, the, duplicitous, john, on, his, side, philip, entrusted, him, with, the, defence, of, the, town, of, vreux, meanwhile, philip, was, joined, by, count, baldwin, ix, of, flanders, and, together, they, laid, siege, to, rouen, the, ducal, capital, of, normandy, here, philip, s, advance, was, halted, by, a, defense, led, by, the, earl, of, leicester, unable, to, penetrate, this, defense, philip, moved, on, at, mantes, on, 9, july, 1193, philip, came, to, terms, with, richard, s, ministers, who, agreed, that, philip, could, keep, his, gains, and, would, be, given, some, extra, territories, if, he, ceased, all, further, aggressive, actions, in, normandy, along, with, the, condition, that, philip, would, hand, back, the, captured, territory, if, richard, would, pay, homage, to, prevent, richard, from, spoiling, their, plans, philip, and, john, attempted, to, bribe, holy, roman, emperor, henry, vi, in, order, to, keep, the, english, king, captive, for, a, little, while, longer, henry, refused, and, richard, was, released, from, captivity, on, 4, february, 1194, by, 13, march, richard, had, returned, to, england, and, by, 12, may, he, had, set, sail, for, normandy, with, some, 300, ships, eager, to, engage, philip, in, war, philip, had, spent, this, time, consolidating, his, territorial, gains, and, by, now, controlled, much, of, normandy, east, of, the, seine, while, remaining, within, striking, distance, of, rouen, his, next, objective, was, the, castle, of, verneuil, which, had, withstood, an, earlier, siege, once, richard, arrived, at, barfleur, he, soon, marched, towards, verneuil, as, his, forces, neared, the, castle, philip, who, had, been, unable, to, break, through, decided, to, strike, camp, leaving, a, large, force, behind, to, prosecute, the, siege, he, moved, off, towards, vreux, which, john, had, handed, over, to, his, brother, to, prove, his, loyalty, philip, retook, the, town, and, sacked, it, but, during, this, time, his, forces, at, verneuil, abandoned, the, siege, and, richard, entered, the, castle, unopposed, on, 30, may, throughout, june, while, philip, s, campaign, ground, to, a, halt, in, the, north, richard, was, taking, a, number, of, important, fortresses, to, the, south, philip, eager, to, relieve, the, pressure, off, his, allies, in, the, south, marched, to, confront, richard, s, forces, at, vend, me, refusing, to, risk, everything, in, a, major, battle, philip, retreated, only, to, have, his, rear, guard, caught, at, fr, teval, on, 3, july, this, battle, of, fr, teval, turned, into, a, general, encounter, in, which, philip, barely, managed, to, avoid, capture, as, his, army, was, put, to, flight, fleeing, back, to, normandy, philip, avenged, himself, on, the, english, by, attacking, the, forces, of, john, and, the, earl, of, arundel, seizing, their, baggage, train, by, now, both, sides, were, tiring, and, they, agreed, to, the, temporary, truce, of, tilli, res, the, war, resumed, in, 1195, when, philip, once, again, besieged, verneuil, he, continued, the, siege, in, secret, as, richard, arrived, to, negotiate, in, person, when, richard, found, out, he, swore, revenge, and, left, philip, now, pressed, his, advantage, in, northeastern, normandy, where, he, conducted, a, raid, at, dieppe, burning, the, english, ships, in, the, harbor, while, repulsing, an, attack, by, richard, at, the, same, time, philip, now, marched, southward, into, the, berry, region, his, primary, objective, was, the, fortress, of, issoudun, which, had, just, been, captured, by, richard, s, mercenary, commander, mercadier, the, french, king, took, the, town, and, was, besieging, the, castle, when, richard, stormed, through, french, lines, and, made, his, way, in, to, reinforce, the, garrison, while, at, the, same, time, another, army, was, approaching, philip, s, supply, lines, philip, called, off, his, attack, and, another, truce, was, agreed, the, treaty, of, louviers, the, war, slowly, turned, against, philip, over, the, course, of, the, next, three, years, political, and, military, conditions, seemed, promising, at, the, start, of, 1196, when, richard, s, nephew, arthur, i, duke, of, brittany, ended, up, in, philip, s, hands, and, he, won, the, siege, of, aumale, but, philip, s, good, fortune, did, not, last, richard, won, over, a, key, ally, baldwin, of, flanders, in, 1197, the, same, year, the, holy, roman, emperor, henry, vi, died, and, was, succeeded, by, otto, iv, richard, s, nephew, who, put, additional, pressure, on, philip, finally, many, norman, lords, were, switching, sides, and, returning, to, richard, s, camp, this, was, the, state, of, affairs, when, philip, launched, his, campaign, of, 1198, with, an, attack, on, vexin, that, was, pushed, back, and, then, compounded, by, the, flemish, invasion, of, artois, on, 27, september, richard, entered, vexin, taking, courcelles, sur, seine, and, boury, en, vexin, before, returning, to, dangu, philip, believing, that, courcelles, was, still, holding, out, went, to, its, relief, discovering, what, was, happening, richard, decided, to, attack, the, french, king, s, forces, catching, philip, by, surprise, philip, s, forces, withdrew, and, attempted, to, reach, the, fortress, of, gisors, bunched, together, the, french, knights, with, king, philip, attempted, to, cross, the, epte, river, on, a, bridge, that, promptly, collapsed, under, their, weight, almost, drowning, philip, in, the, process, he, was, dragged, out, of, the, river, and, shut, himself, up, in, gisors, having, successfully, evaded, richard, and, reinforced, the, fortress, philip, soon, planned, a, new, offensive, launching, destructive, raids, into, normandy, and, again, targeting, vreux, richard, countered, philip, s, thrust, with, a, counterattack, in, vexin, while, mercadier, led, a, raid, on, abbeville, by, autumn, 1198, richard, had, regained, almost, all, that, had, been, lost, in, 1193, with, the, warring, sides, in, a, deadlock, philip, offered, a, truce, so, that, discussions, could, begin, towards, a, more, permanent, peace, with, the, offer, that, he, would, return, all, of, the, territories, except, for, gisors, in, mid, january, 1199, the, two, kings, met, for, a, final, meeting, richard, standing, on, the, deck, of, a, boat, and, philip, standing, on, the, banks, of, the, seine, river, shouting, terms, at, each, other, they, could, not, reach, an, agreement, on, the, terms, of, a, permanent, truce, but, they, did, agree, to, further, mediation, which, resulted, in, a, five, year, truce, that, held, later, in, 1199, richard, was, killed, during, a, siege, involving, one, of, his, vassals, in, may, 1200, philip, signed, the, treaty, of, le, goulet, with, richard, s, successor, john, the, treaty, was, meant, to, bring, peace, to, normandy, by, settling, the, issue, of, its, much, reduced, boundaries, the, terms, of, john, s, vassalage, were, not, only, for, normandy, but, also, for, anjou, maine, and, touraine, john, agreed, to, heavy, terms, including, the, abandonment, of, all, the, english, possessions, in, berry, and, 20, 000, marks, of, silver, while, philip, in, turn, recognized, john, as, king, of, england, formally, abandoning, arthur, of, brittany, s, candidacy, whom, he, had, hitherto, supported, recognizing, instead, john, s, suzerainty, over, the, duchy, of, brittany, to, seal, the, treaty, a, marriage, between, blanche, of, castile, john, s, niece, and, louis, the, lion, philip, s, son, was, contracted, this, agreement, did, not, bring, warfare, to, an, end, in, france, however, since, john, s, mismanagement, of, aquitaine, led, the, province, to, rebel, later, in, 1200, a, disturbance, that, philip, secretly, encouraged, to, disguise, his, ambitions, philip, invited, john, to, a, conference, at, andely, and, then, entertained, him, at, paris, and, both, times, he, committed, to, complying, with, the, treaty, in, 1202, disaffected, patrons, petitioned, the, french, king, to, summon, john, to, answer, their, charges, in, his, capacity, as, john, s, feudal, lord, in, france, john, refused, to, appear, so, philip, again, took, up, arthur, of, brittany, s, claims, to, the, english, throne, as, well, as, betrothing, him, to, his, six, year, old, daughter, marie, in, retaliation, john, crossed, over, into, normandy, and, his, forces, soon, captured, arthur, presumably, as, well, as, arthur, s, sister, eleanor, in, 1203, arthur, disappeared, with, most, people, believing, that, john, had, had, him, murdered, the, outcry, over, arthur, s, fate, saw, an, increase, in, local, opposition, to, john, which, philip, used, to, his, advantage, he, took, to, the, offensive, and, apart, from, a, five, month, siege, of, andely, swept, all, before, him, after, andely, surrendered, john, fled, to, england, by, the, end, of, 1204, most, of, normandy, and, the, angevin, lands, including, much, of, aquitaine, had, fallen, into, philip, s, hands, philip, requested, john, release, eleanor, of, brittany, claiming, that, she, was, to, be, his, daughter, in, law, but, to, no, avail, what, philip, had, gained, through, victory, in, war, he, sought, to, confirm, by, legal, means, philip, again, acting, as, john, s, liege, lord, over, his, french, lands, summoned, him, to, appear, before, the, court, of, the, twelve, peers, of, france, to, answer, for, arthur, s, murder, john, requested, safe, conduct, but, philip, only, agreed, to, allow, him, to, come, in, peace, while, providing, for, his, return, only, if, it, were, allowed, after, the, judgment, of, his, peers, not, willing, to, risk, his, life, on, such, a, guarantee, john, refused, to, appear, so, philip, summarily, dispossessed, the, english, of, all, lands, pushed, by, his, barons, john, eventually, launched, an, invasion, of, northern, france, in, 1206, disembarking, with, his, army, at, la, rochelle, during, one, of, philip, s, absences, but, the, campaign, ended, up, a, disaster, after, backing, out, of, a, conference, that, he, himself, had, demanded, john, eventually, bargained, at, thouars, for, a, two, year, truce, the, price, of, which, was, his, agreement, to, the, chief, provisions, of, the, judgment, of, the, court, of, peers, including, a, loss, of, his, patrimony, in, 1208, philip, of, swabia, the, successful, candidate, to, become, holy, roman, emperor, was, assassinated, as, a, result, the, imperial, crown, was, given, to, his, rival, otto, iv, the, nephew, of, king, john, otto, prior, to, his, accession, had, promised, to, help, john, recover, his, lost, possessions, in, france, but, circumstances, prevented, him, from, making, good, on, his, promise, by, 1212, both, john, and, otto, were, engaged, in, power, struggles, against, pope, innocent, iii, john, over, his, refusal, to, accept, the, papal, nomination, for, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, otto, over, his, attempt, to, strip, king, frederick, ii, of, germany, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, philip, decided, to, take, advantage, of, this, situation, first, in, germany, where, he, aided, the, german, noble, rebellion, in, support, of, the, young, frederick, john, immediately, threw, england, s, weight, behind, otto, and, philip, now, saw, his, chance, to, launch, a, successful, invasion, of, england, in, order, to, secure, the, cooperation, of, all, his, vassals, in, his, plans, for, the, invasion, philip, denounced, john, as, an, enemy, of, the, church, thereby, justifying, his, attack, as, motivated, solely, by, religious, scruples, he, summoned, an, assembly, of, french, barons, at, soissons, which, was, well, attended, the, only, exception, was, count, ferdinand, of, flanders, who, refused, out, of, anger, over, the, loss, of, the, towns, of, aire, and, saint, omer, that, had, been, captured, by, philip, s, son, louis, the, lion, he, would, not, participate, in, any, campaign, until, he, was, restored, to, his, ancient, lands, philip, was, eager, to, prove, his, loyalty, to, rome, and, thus, secure, papal, support, for, his, planned, invasion, announced, at, soissons, a, reconciliation, with, his, estranged, wife, ingeborg, of, denmark, which, the, popes, had, been, promoting, the, barons, fully, supported, his, plan, and, they, all, gathered, their, forces, and, prepared, to, join, with, philip, at, the, agreed, rendezvous, through, all, of, this, philip, remained, in, constant, communication, with, pandulf, verraccio, the, papal, legate, who, was, encouraging, philip, to, pursue, his, objective, verraccio, however, was, also, holding, secret, discussions, with, king, john, advising, the, english, king, of, his, precarious, predicament, he, persuaded, john, to, abandon, his, opposition, to, papal, investiture, and, agreed, to, accept, the, papal, legate, s, decision, in, any, ecclesiastical, disputes, as, final, in, return, the, pope, agreed, to, accept, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, lordship, of, ireland, as, papal, fiefs, which, john, would, rule, as, the, pope, s, vassal, and, for, which, john, would, do, homage, to, the, pope, no, sooner, had, the, treaty, between, john, and, the, pope, been, ratified, in, may, 1213, than, verraccio, announced, to, philip, that, he, would, have, to, abandon, his, expedition, against, john, since, to, attack, a, faithful, vassal, of, the, holy, see, would, be, a, mortal, sin, philip, argued, in, vain, that, his, plans, had, been, drawn, up, with, the, consent, of, rome, that, his, expedition, was, in, support, of, papal, authority, that, he, only, undertook, on, the, understanding, that, he, would, gain, a, plenary, indulgence, he, had, spent, a, fortune, preparing, for, the, expedition, the, papal, legate, remained, unmoved, but, verraccio, did, suggest, an, alternative, the, count, of, flanders, had, denied, philip, s, right, to, declare, war, on, england, while, king, john, was, still, excommunicated, and, that, his, disobedience, needed, to, be, punished, philip, eagerly, accepted, the, advice, and, quickly, marched, at, the, head, of, his, troops, into, the, territory, of, flanders, the, french, fleet, proceeded, first, to, gravelines, and, then, to, the, port, of, damme, meanwhile, the, army, marched, by, cassel, ypres, and, bruges, before, laying, siege, to, ghent, hardly, had, the, siege, begun, when, philip, learned, that, the, english, fleet, had, captured, a, number, of, his, ships, at, damme, and, that, the, rest, were, so, closely, blockaded, in, its, harbor, that, it, was, impossible, for, them, to, escape, he, ordered, the, fleet, to, be, burned, to, prevent, it, from, falling, into, enemy, hands, the, destruction, of, the, french, fleet, had, once, again, raised, john, s, hopes, so, he, began, preparing, for, an, invasion, of, france, and, a, reconquest, of, his, lost, provinces, the, english, barons, were, initially, unenthusiastic, about, the, expedition, which, delayed, his, departure, so, it, was, not, until, february, 1214, that, he, disembarked, at, la, rochelle, john, was, to, advance, from, the, loire, while, his, ally, otto, iv, made, a, simultaneous, attack, from, flanders, together, with, the, count, of, flanders, the, three, armies, did, not, coordinate, their, efforts, effectively, it, was, not, until, john, had, been, disappointed, in, his, hope, for, an, easy, victory, after, being, driven, from, roche, au, moine, and, had, retreated, to, his, transports, that, the, imperial, army, with, otto, at, its, head, assembled, in, the, low, countries, on, 27, july, 1214, the, opposing, armies, suddenly, discovered, that, they, were, in, close, proximity, to, one, another, on, the, banks, of, a, little, tributary, of, the, river, lys, near, the, bridge, at, bouvines, it, being, a, sunday, philip, did, not, expect, the, allied, army, to, attack, as, it, was, considered, unholy, to, fight, on, the, sabbath, philip, s, army, numbered, some, 7, 000, while, the, allied, forces, possessed, around, 9, 000, troops, the, armies, clashed, at, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, bouvines, philip, was, unhorsed, by, the, flemish, pikemen, in, the, heat, of, battle, and, were, it, not, for, his, mail, armor, he, would, have, probably, been, killed, when, otto, was, carried, off, the, field, by, his, wounded, and, terrified, horse, and, the, count, of, flanders, was, severely, wounded, and, taken, prisoner, the, flemish, and, imperial, troops, saw, that, the, battle, was, lost, turned, and, fled, the, field, the, french, did, not, pursue, philip, returned, to, paris, triumphant, marching, his, captive, prisoners, behind, him, in, a, long, procession, as, his, grateful, subjects, came, out, to, greet, the, victorious, king, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, otto, retreated, to, his, castle, of, harzburg, and, was, soon, overthrown, as, holy, roman, emperor, to, be, replaced, by, frederick, ii, count, ferdinand, remained, imprisoned, following, his, defeat, while, king, john, s, attempt, to, rebuild, the, angevin, empire, ended, in, complete, failure, philip, s, decisive, victory, was, crucial, in, shaping, western, european, politics, in, both, england, and, france, in, england, the, defeated, john, was, so, weakened, that, he, was, soon, required, to, submit, to, the, demands, of, his, barons, and, sign, magna, carta, which, limited, the, power, of, the, crown, and, established, the, basis, for, common, law, the, battle, of, bouvines, marked, the, end, of, the, angevin, empire, after, the, early, death, of, isabella, of, hainault, in, childbirth, in, 1190, philip, decided, to, marry, again, he, decided, on, ingeborg, daughter, of, king, valdemar, i, of, denmark, who, received, 10, 000, marks, of, silver, as, a, dowry, philip, met, her, at, amiens, on, 14, august, 1193, and, they, were, married, that, same, day, at, the, feast, of, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, archbishop, guillaume, of, reims, crowned, both, philip, and, ingeborg, during, the, ceremony, philip, was, pale, nervous, and, could, not, wait, for, the, ceremony, to, end, following, the, ceremony, he, had, ingeborg, sent, to, the, convent, of, saint, maur, des, fosses, and, asked, pope, celestine, iii, for, an, annulment, on, the, grounds, of, non, consummation, philip, had, not, reckoned, with, ingeborg, however, she, insisted, that, the, marriage, had, been, consummated, and, that, she, was, his, wife, and, the, rightful, queen, of, france, the, franco, danish, churchman, william, of, belholt, intervened, on, ingeborg, s, side, drawing, up, a, genealogy, of, the, danish, kings, to, disprove, the, alleged, impediment, of, consanguinity, in, the, meantime, philip, had, sought, a, new, bride, initial, agreement, had, been, reached, for, him, to, marry, margaret, daughter, of, count, william, i, of, geneva, but, the, young, bride, s, journey, to, paris, was, interrupted, by, thomas, count, of, savoy, who, kidnapped, philip, s, intended, new, wife, and, married, her, instead, claiming, that, philip, was, already, bound, in, marriage, philip, finally, achieved, a, third, marriage, in, june, 1196, when, he, was, married, to, agnes, of, merania, from, dalmatia, their, children, were, marie, and, philip, count, of, clermont, pope, innocent, iii, declared, philip, augustus, marriage, to, agnes, of, merania, null, and, void, as, he, was, still, married, to, ingeborg, he, ordered, the, king, to, part, from, agnes, and, when, he, did, not, the, pope, placed, france, under, an, interdict, in, 1199, this, continued, until, 7, september, 1200, due, to, pressure, from, the, pope, ingeborg, s, brother, king, valdemar, ii, of, denmark, and, ultimately, agnes, death, in, 1201, philip, finally, took, ingeborg, back, as, his, wife, but, it, would, not, be, until, 1213, that, she, would, be, recognized, at, court, as, queen, the, only, known, description, of, philip, describes, him, as, a, handsome, strapping, fellow, with, a, cheerful, face, of, ruddy, complexion, and, a, temperament, much, inclined, towards, good, living, wine, and, women, he, was, generous, to, his, friends, stingy, towards, those, who, displeased, him, well, versed, in, the, art, of, stratagem, orthodox, in, belief, prudent, and, stubborn, in, his, resolves, he, made, judgements, with, great, speed, and, exactitude, fortune, s, favorite, fearful, for, his, life, easily, excited, and, easily, placated, he, was, very, tough, with, powerful, men, who, resisted, him, and, took, pleasure, in, provoking, discord, among, them, never, however, did, he, cause, an, adversary, to, die, in, prison, he, liked, to, employ, humble, men, to, be, the, subduer, of, the, proud, the, defender, of, the, church, and, feeder, of, the, poor, when, pope, innocent, iii, called, for, a, crusade, against, the, albigensians, or, cathars, in, languedoc, in, 1208, philip, did, nothing, to, support, it, though, he, did, not, stop, his, nobles, from, joining, in, the, war, against, the, cathars, did, not, end, until, 1244, when, their, last, strongholds, were, finally, captured, the, fruits, of, the, victory, the, submission, of, the, south, of, france, to, the, crown, were, to, be, reaped, by, philip, s, son, louis, viii, and, grandson, louis, ix, from, 1216, to, 1222, philip, also, arbitrated, in, the, war, of, the, succession, of, champagne, and, finally, helped, the, military, efforts, of, duke, odo, iii, of, burgundy, and, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, to, bring, it, to, an, end, philip, ii, augustus, played, a, significant, role, in, one, of, the, greatest, centuries, of, innovation, in, construction, and, education, in, france, with, paris, as, his, capital, he, had, the, main, thoroughfares, paved, built, a, central, market, les, halles, continued, the, construction, begun, in, 1163, of, notre, dame, de, paris, constructed, the, first, incarnation, of, the, louvre, as, a, fortress, and, gave, a, charter, to, the, university, of, paris, in, 1200, under, his, guidance, paris, became, the, first, city, of, teachers, the, medieval, world, knew, in, 1224, the, french, poet, henry, d, andeli, wrote, of, the, great, wine, tasting, competition, that, philip, ii, augustus, commissioned, the, battle, of, the, wines, philip, ii, fell, ill, in, september, 1222, and, had, a, will, made, but, carried, on, with, his, itinerary, traveling, in, hot, weather, the, next, summer, resulted, in, a, fever, the, king, recovered, and, felt, well, enough, to, resume, his, restless, activity, of, touring, his, kingdom, the, partial, return, of, his, health, prompted, him, to, travel, to, paris, on, 13, july, 1223, against, the, advice, of, his, physician, the, journey, proved, too, much, for, him, and, he, died, en, route, the, next, day, in, mantes, la, jolie, at, the, age, of, 57, his, body, was, carried, to, paris, on, a, bier, he, was, interred, in, the, basilica, of, st, denis, in, the, presence, of, his, son, and, successor, louis, viii, as, well, as, his, illegitimate, son, philip, i, count, of, boulogne, and, john, of, brienne, the, king, of, jerusalem
