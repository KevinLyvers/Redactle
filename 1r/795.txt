xenophon, of, athens, z, n, f, n, z, i, n, f, n, ancient, greek, romanized, xenoph, n, c, 430, probably, 355, or, 354, bc, was, a, greek, military, leader, philosopher, and, historian, born, in, athens, at, the, age, of, 30, xenophon, was, elected, as, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, retreating, greek, mercenaries, the, ten, thousand, who, had, been, part, of, cyrus, s, attempt, to, seize, control, of, the, achaemenid, empire, as, the, military, historian, theodore, ayrault, dodge, wrote, the, centuries, since, have, devised, nothing, to, surpass, the, genius, of, this, warrior, xenophon, established, precedents, for, many, logistical, operations, and, was, among, the, first, to, describe, strategic, flanking, maneuvers, and, feints, in, combat, for, at, least, two, millennia, it, has, been, debated, whether, or, not, xenophon, was, first, and, foremost, a, general, historian, or, philosopher, for, the, majority, of, time, in, the, past, two, millennia, xenophon, was, recognized, as, a, philosopher, quintilian, in, the, orator, s, education, discusses, the, most, prominent, historians, orators, and, philosophers, as, examples, of, eloquence, and, recognizes, xenophon, s, historical, work, but, ultimately, places, xenophon, next, to, plato, as, a, philosopher, today, xenophon, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, greatest, writers, of, antiquity, xenophon, s, works, span, multiple, genres, and, are, written, in, plain, attic, greek, which, is, why, they, have, often, been, used, in, translation, exercises, for, contemporary, students, of, the, ancient, greek, language, in, the, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, diogenes, la, rtius, observed, that, xenophon, was, known, as, the, attic, muse, because, of, the, sweetness, of, his, diction, despite, being, born, an, athenian, citizen, xenophon, came, to, be, associated, with, sparta, the, traditional, opponent, of, athens, much, of, what, is, known, today, about, the, spartan, society, comes, from, xenophon, s, royal, biography, of, the, spartan, king, agesilaus, and, the, constitution, of, the, lacedaemonians, the, sub, satrap, mania, is, primarily, known, through, xenophon, s, writings, xenophon, s, anabasis, recounts, his, adventures, with, the, ten, thousand, while, in, the, service, of, cyrus, the, younger, cyrus, s, failed, campaign, to, claim, the, persian, throne, from, artaxerxes, ii, of, persia, and, the, return, of, greek, mercenaries, after, cyrus, s, death, in, the, battle, of, cunaxa, xenophon, wrote, cyropaedia, outlining, both, military, and, political, methods, used, by, cyrus, the, great, to, conquer, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, 539, bc, anabasis, and, cyropaedia, inspired, alexander, the, great, and, other, greeks, to, conquer, babylon, and, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 331, bc, the, hellenica, continues, directly, from, the, final, sentence, of, thucydides, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, covering, the, last, seven, years, of, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, and, the, subsequent, forty, two, years, 404, 362, bc, ending, with, the, second, battle, of, mantinea, xenophon, was, born, c, 430, bc, in, the, deme, local, district, of, erchia, in, athens, xenophon, s, father, gryllus, was, a, member, of, a, wealthy, equestrian, family, it, was, in, his, youth, that, he, first, associated, with, socrates, and, as, was, common, for, wealthy, young, men, in, this, period, he, probably, served, in, the, athenian, cavalry, he, appears, to, have, remained, in, athens, during, the, overthrow, of, athenian, democracy, under, the, thirty, tyrants, and, fought, democratic, insurgents, in, the, civil, war, of, 403, 404, accounts, of, events, in, hellenica, suggest, that, xenophon, personally, witnessed, tumultuous, political, events, such, as, the, return, of, alcibiades, in, 407, bc, the, trial, of, the, generals, in, 406, bc, and, the, overthrow, of, the, thirty, tyrants, in, 403, bc, personally, invited, by, proxenus, of, beotia, anabasis, 3, 1, 9, one, of, the, captains, in, cyrus, s, mercenary, army, xenophon, sailed, to, ephesus, to, meet, cyrus, the, younger, and, participate, in, cyrus, s, military, campaign, against, tissaphernes, the, persian, satrap, of, ionia, xenophon, describes, his, life, in, 401, bc, and, 400, bc, in, the, memoir, anabasis, written, years, after, the, events, it, recounts, xenophon, s, book, anabasis, greek, literally, going, up, is, his, record, of, the, expedition, of, cyrus, and, the, greek, mercenaries, journey, to, home, xenophon, writes, that, he, asked, socrates, for, advice, on, whether, to, go, with, cyrus, and, that, socrates, referred, him, to, the, pythia, xenophon, s, query, to, the, oracle, however, was, not, whether, or, not, to, accept, cyrus, invitation, but, to, which, of, the, gods, he, must, pray, and, do, sacrifice, so, that, he, might, best, accomplish, his, intended, journey, and, return, in, safety, with, good, fortune, the, oracle, answered, his, question, and, told, him, which, gods, to, pray, and, sacrifice, to, when, xenophon, returned, to, athens, and, told, socrates, of, the, oracle, s, advice, socrates, chastised, him, for, asking, so, disingenuous, a, question, anabasis, 3, 1, 5, 7, under, the, pretext, of, fighting, tissaphernes, the, persian, satrap, of, ionia, cyrus, assembled, a, massive, army, composed, of, native, persian, soldiers, and, greeks, prior, to, waging, war, against, artaxerxes, cyrus, proposed, that, the, enemy, was, the, pisidians, and, so, the, greeks, were, unaware, that, they, were, to, battle, against, the, larger, army, of, king, artaxerxes, ii, anabasis, 1, 1, 8, 11, at, tarsus, the, soldiers, became, aware, of, cyrus, s, plans, to, depose, the, king, and, as, a, result, refused, to, continue, anabasis, 1, 3, 1, however, clearchus, a, spartan, general, convinced, the, greeks, to, continue, with, the, expedition, the, army, of, cyrus, met, the, army, of, artaxerxes, ii, in, the, battle, of, cunaxa, cyrus, was, killed, in, the, battle, anabasis, 1, 8, 27, 1, 9, 1, shortly, thereafter, clearchus, was, invited, by, tissaphernes, to, a, feast, where, alongside, four, other, generals, and, many, captains, including, xenophon, s, friend, proxenus, he, was, captured, and, executed, anabasis, 2, 5, 31, 32, the, mercenaries, known, as, the, ten, thousand, had, no, leadership, in, territory, near, mesopotamia, they, elected, new, leaders, including, xenophon, himself, dodge, says, of, xenophon, s, generalship, xenophon, is, the, father, of, the, system, of, retreat, he, reduced, its, management, to, a, perfect, method, xenophon, and, his, men, initially, had, to, deal, with, volleys, by, a, minor, force, of, harassing, persian, missile, cavalry, one, night, xenophon, formed, a, body, of, archers, and, light, cavalry, when, the, persian, cavalry, arrived, the, next, day, now, firing, within, several, yards, xenophon, unleashed, his, new, cavalry, killing, many, and, routing, the, rest, tissaphernes, pursued, xenophon, and, when, the, greeks, reached, the, great, zab, river, one, of, the, men, devised, a, plan, goats, cows, sheep, and, donkeys, were, to, be, slaughtered, and, their, bodies, stuffed, with, hay, sewn, up, laid, across, the, river, and, covered, with, dirt, so, as, not, to, be, slippery, and, be, used, as, a, bridge, to, cross, the, river, this, plan, was, discarded, as, impractical, dodge, notes, on, this, retreat, also, was, first, shown, the, necessary, if, cruel, means, of, arresting, a, pursuing, enemy, by, the, systematic, devastation, of, the, country, traversed, and, the, destruction, of, its, villages, to, deprive, him, of, food, and, shelter, and, xenophon, is, moreover, the, first, who, established, in, rear, of, the, phalanx, a, reserve, from, which, he, could, at, will, feed, weak, parts, of, his, line, this, was, a, superb, first, conception, the, ten, thousand, eventually, made, their, way, into, the, land, of, the, carduchians, a, wild, tribe, inhabiting, the, mountains, of, modern, southeastern, turkey, once, the, great, king, had, sent, into, their, country, an, army, of, 120, 000, men, to, subdue, them, but, of, all, that, great, host, not, one, had, ever, seen, his, home, again, the, ten, thousand, were, shot, at, with, stones, and, arrows, for, several, days, before, they, reached, a, defile, where, the, main, carduchian, host, sat, xenophon, had, 8, 000, men, feint, and, marched, the, other, 2, 000, to, a, pass, revealed, by, a, prisoner, under, the, cover, of, a, rainstorm, and, at, daylight, they, pushed, in, after, the, fighting, the, greeks, went, to, the, northern, foothills, of, the, mountains, at, the, centrites, river, later, finding, a, persian, force, blocking, the, route, north, xenophon, s, scouts, found, another, ford, but, the, persians, blocked, this, as, well, xenophon, sent, a, small, force, back, toward, the, other, ford, causing, the, persians, to, detach, a, major, part, of, their, force, parallel, xenophon, overwhelmed, the, force, at, his, ford, winter, has, arrived, as, the, greeks, marched, through, armenia, absolutely, unprovided, with, clothing, suitable, for, such, weather, the, greeks, decided, to, attack, a, wooden, castle, known, to, have, had, storage, the, castle, was, stationed, on, a, hill, surrounded, by, forest, xenophon, ordered, small, parties, of, his, men, to, appear, on, the, hill, road, and, when, the, defenders, fired, one, soldier, would, leap, into, the, trees, then, the, other, men, followed, his, example, when, the, stones, were, almost, exhausted, the, soldiers, raced, one, another, over, the, exposed, part, of, the, road, storming, the, fortress, with, most, of, the, garrison, now, neutralized, soon, after, xenophon, s, men, reached, trapezus, on, the, coast, of, the, black, sea, anabasis, 4, 8, 22, before, their, departure, the, greeks, made, an, alliance, with, the, locals, and, fought, one, last, battle, against, the, colchians, vassals, of, the, persians, xenophon, ordered, his, men, to, deploy, the, line, extremely, thin, so, as, to, overlap, the, enemy, the, colchians, divided, their, army, to, check, the, greek, deployment, opening, a, gap, in, their, line, through, which, xenophon, rushed, in, his, reserves, they, then, made, their, way, westward, back, to, greek, territory, via, chrysopolis, anabasis, 6, 3, 16, once, there, they, helped, seuthes, ii, make, himself, king, of, thrace, before, being, recruited, into, the, army, of, the, spartan, general, thimbron, whom, xenophon, refers, to, as, thibron, xenophon, s, conduct, of, the, retreat, caused, dodge, to, name, the, athenian, knight, the, greatest, general, that, preceded, alexander, the, great, xenophon, s, anabasis, ends, in, 399, bc, in, the, city, of, pergamon, with, the, arrival, of, the, spartan, commander, thimbron, thimbron, s, campaign, is, described, in, hellenica, in, the, describtors, after, capturing, teuthrania, and, halisarna, the, greeks, led, by, thimbron, lay, siege, to, larissa, failing, to, capture, larissa, the, greeks, fall, back, to, caria, as, a, result, the, ephors, of, sparta, recall, thimbron, and, send, dercylidas, to, lead, the, greek, army, after, facing, the, court, at, sparta, thimbron, is, banished, xenophon, describes, dercylidas, as, a, significantly, more, experienced, commander, than, thimbron, led, by, dercylidas, xenophon, and, the, greek, army, march, to, aeolis, and, capture, nine, cities, in, 8, days, including, larissa, hamaxitus, and, kolonai, the, persians, negotiated, a, temporary, truce, and, the, greek, army, retired, for, a, winter, camp, at, byzantium, in, 398, bc, xenophon, captured, the, city, of, lampsacus, the, spartan, ephors, officially, cleared, the, ten, thousand, of, any, previous, wrongdoing, the, ten, thousand, were, likely, a, part, of, the, investigation, of, thimbron, s, failure, at, larissa, and, integrated, the, ten, thousand, into, dercylidas, army, hellenica, mentions, the, response, of, the, commander, of, the, ten, thousand, but, men, of, lacedaemon, we, are, the, same, men, now, as, we, were, last, year, but, the, commander, now, is, one, man, dercylidas, and, in, the, past, was, another, thimbron, therefore, you, are, at, once, able, to, judge, for, yourselves, the, reason, why, we, are, not, at, fault, now, although, we, were, then, in, 397, bc, dercylidas, force, mirrored, the, movement, of, tissaphernes, and, pharnabazus, forces, near, ephesus, but, did, not, engage, in, battle, the, persian, army, retreated, to, tralles, and, the, greeks, to, leucophrys, dercylidas, proposed, the, new, terms, of, truce, to, tissaphernes, and, pharnabazus, and, the, three, parties, submitted, the, truce, proposal, to, sparta, and, the, persian, king, for, ratification, under, dercylidas, proposal, the, persians, abandoned, claims, to, independent, greek, cities, in, ionia, and, the, spartans, withdrew, the, army, in, 396, bc, the, newly, appointed, spartan, king, agesilaus, arrived, at, ephesus, and, assumed, command, of, the, army, from, dercylidas, xenophon, joined, agesilaus, campaign, for, the, ionian, greece, independence, of, 396, 394, bc, in, 394, bc, agesilaus, army, returned, to, greece, taking, the, route, of, the, persian, invasion, eighty, years, earlier, and, fought, in, the, battle, of, coronea, athens, banished, xenophon, for, fighting, on, the, spartan, side, xenophon, probably, followed, agesilaus, march, to, sparta, in, 394, bc, and, finished, his, military, journey, after, seven, years, xenophon, received, an, estate, in, scillus, where, he, spent, the, next, twenty, three, years, in, 371, bc, after, the, battle, of, leuctra, the, elians, confiscated, xenophon, s, estate, and, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, xenophon, moved, to, corinth, diogenes, writes, that, xenophon, lived, in, corinth, until, his, death, in, 354, bc, at, around, the, age, of, 74, or, 75, pausanias, mentions, xenophon, s, tomb, in, scillus, xenophon, took, a, keen, interest, in, political, philosophy, and, his, work, often, examines, leadership, xenophon, wrote, the, cyropaedia, to, outline, his, political, and, moral, philosophy, he, did, this, by, endowing, a, fictional, version, of, the, boyhood, of, cyrus, the, great, founder, of, the, first, persian, empire, with, the, qualities, of, what, xenophon, considered, the, ideal, ruler, historians, have, asked, whether, xenophon, s, portrait, of, cyrus, was, accurate, or, if, xenophon, imbued, cyrus, with, events, from, xenophon, s, own, life, there, is, a, consensus, that, cyrus, s, career, is, best, outlined, in, the, histories, of, herodotus, herodotus, contradicts, xenophon, at, several, other, points, herodotus, says, that, cyrus, led, a, rebellion, against, his, maternal, grandfather, astyages, king, of, media, and, defeated, him, thereafter, keeping, astyages, in, his, court, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, histories, 1, 130, the, medes, were, thus, reduced, to, subjection, 1, 130, and, became, slaves, 1, 129, to, the, persians, 20, years, before, the, capture, of, babylon, in, 539, bc, the, cyropaedia, relates, instead, that, astyages, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, cyaxares, ii, the, maternal, uncle, of, cyrus, 1, 5, 2, in, the, initial, campaign, against, the, lydians, babylonians, and, their, allies, the, medians, were, led, by, cyaxares, and, the, persians, by, cyrus, who, was, crown, prince, of, the, persians, since, his, father, was, still, alive, 4, 5, 17, xenophon, relates, that, at, this, time, the, medes, were, the, strongest, of, the, kingdoms, that, opposed, the, babylonians, 1, 5, 2, in, the, harran, stele, a, document, from, the, court, of, nabonidus, wrote, the, same, point, in, the, entry, for, year, 14, or, 15, of, his, reign, 542, 540, bc, nabonidus, speaks, of, his, enemies, as, the, kings, of, egypt, the, medes, and, the, arabs, there, is, no, mention, of, the, persians, according, to, herodotus, and, the, current, consensus, the, medians, had, been, made, slaves, of, the, persians, several, years, previously, an, archaeological, bas, reliefs, in, the, stairway, at, persepolis, shows, no, distinction, in, official, status, between, the, persian, and, median, olmstead, nevertheless, wrote, medes, were, honored, equally, with, persians, they, were, employed, in, high, office, and, were, chosen, to, lead, persian, armies, both, herodotus, 1, 123, 214, and, xenophon, 1, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 20, present, cyrus, as, about, 40, years, old, when, his, forces, captured, babylon, in, the, nabonidus, chronicle, there, is, mention, of, the, death, of, the, wife, of, the, king, name, not, given, within, a, month, after, the, capture, of, babylon, it, has, been, conjectured, that, this, was, cyrus, s, first, wife, cyropaedia, s, stated, 8, 5, 19, that, cyaxares, ii, gave, his, daughter, in, marriage, to, cyrus, soon, after, the, fall, of, the, city, with, the, kingdom, of, media, as, her, dowry, the, cyropaedia, praises, the, first, persian, emperor, cyrus, the, great, and, it, was, through, his, greatness, that, the, persian, empire, held, together, however, following, the, lead, of, leo, strauss, david, johnson, suggests, that, there, is, a, subtle, layer, to, the, book, in, which, xenophon, conveys, criticism, of, the, persians, the, spartans, and, the, athenians, in, section, 4, 3, of, the, cyropaedia, cyrus, wrote, his, desire, to, institute, cavalry, he, wrote, that, he, desires, that, no, persian, kalokagathos, noble, and, good, man, literally, or, simply, noble, ever, be, seen, on, foot, but, always, on, a, horse, so, much, so, that, the, persians, may, actually, seem, to, be, centaurs, 4, 3, 22, 23, xenophon, plays, upon, the, post, persian, war, propagandistic, paradigm, of, using, mythological, imagery, to, represent, the, greco, persian, conflict, examples, of, this, include, the, wedding, of, the, lapiths, gigantomachy, trojan, war, and, amazonomachy, on, the, parthenon, frieze, johnson, believes, that, the, unstable, dichotomy, of, man, and, horse, found, in, a, centaur, is, indicative, of, the, unstable, alliance, of, persian, and, mede, formulated, by, cyrus, he, cites, the, regression, of, the, persians, directly, after, the, death, of, cyrus, as, the, result, of, this, instability, a, union, made, possible, only, through, cyrus, the, strength, of, cyrus, in, holding, the, empire, together, is, praiseworthy, according, to, xenophon, however, the, empire, began, to, decline, upon, the, death, of, cyrus, by, this, example, xenophon, sought, to, show, that, empires, lacked, stability, and, could, only, be, maintained, by, a, person, of, remarkable, prowess, such, as, cyrus, xenophon, displays, cyrus, as, a, lofty, temperate, man, he, is, depicted, as, not, subject, to, the, foibles, of, others, he, used, the, example, of, the, persians, to, decry, the, attempts, at, empire, made, by, athens, and, sparta, having, written, the, cyropaedia, after, the, downfall, of, athens, in, the, peloponnesian, war, this, work, criticizes, the, greek, attempts, at, empire, and, monarchy, another, passage, that, johnson, cites, as, criticism, of, monarchy, and, empire, concerns, the, devaluation, of, the, homot, moi, equal, or, same, honours, i, e, peers, homot, moi, were, highly, educated, and, thus, became, the, core, of, the, soldiers, as, heavy, infantry, their, band, 1000, when, cyrus, fought, the, assyrians, shared, equally, in, the, spoils, of, war, however, in, the, face, of, overwhelming, numbers, against, the, assyrians, cyrus, armed, the, commoners, with, similar, arms, instead, of, their, normal, light, ranged, armament, cyropaedia, 2, 1, 9, argument, ensued, as, to, how, the, spoils, would, now, be, split, and, cyrus, enforced, a, meritocracy, many, homot, moi, found, this, unfair, because, their, military, training, was, no, better, than, the, commoners, only, their, education, and, hand, to, hand, combat, was, less, a, matter, of, skill, than, strength, and, bravery, as, johnson, asserts, this, passage, decries, imperial, meritocracy, and, corruption, for, the, homot, moi, now, had, to, ingratiate, themselves, to, the, emperor, for, positions, and, honours, from, this, point, they, were, referred, to, as, ent, moi, no, longer, of, the, same, honours, but, having, to, be, in, to, get, the, honour, the, spartans, wrote, nothing, about, themselves, or, if, they, did, it, it, is, lost, xenophon, in, the, constitution, of, the, spartans, wrote, it, occurred, to, me, one, day, that, sparta, though, among, the, most, thinly, populated, of, states, was, evidently, the, most, powerful, and, most, celebrated, city, in, greece, and, i, fell, to, wondering, how, this, could, have, happened, but, when, i, considered, the, institutions, of, the, spartans, i, wondered, no, longer, xenophon, goes, on, to, describe, in, detail, the, main, aspects, of, laconia, a, short, treatise, on, the, constitution, of, the, athenians, exists, that, was, once, thought, to, be, written, by, xenophon, was, probably, written, when, xenophon, was, about, five, years, old, the, author, often, called, in, english, the, old, oligarch, or, pseudo, xenophon, detests, the, democracy, of, athens, and, the, poorer, classes, but, he, argues, that, the, periclean, institutions, are, well, designed, for, their, deplorable, purposes, xenophon, s, works, include, a, selection, of, socratic, dialogues, these, writings, are, preserved, except, for, the, dialogues, of, plato, they, are, the, only, surviving, representatives, of, the, genre, of, socratic, dialogue, these, works, include, xenophon, s, apology, memorabilia, symposium, and, oeconomicus, the, symposium, outlines, the, character, of, socrates, as, he, and, his, companions, discuss, what, attributes, they, take, pride, in, one, of, the, main, plots, of, the, symposium, is, about, the, type, of, loving, relationship, noble, or, base, a, rich, aristocrat, will, be, able, to, establish, with, a, young, boy, present, at, the, banquet, alongside, his, own, father, in, oeconomicus, socrates, explains, how, to, manage, a, household, both, the, apology, and, the, memorabilia, defend, socrates, character, and, teachings, the, former, is, set, during, the, trial, of, socrates, while, the, latter, explains, his, moral, principles, and, that, he, was, not, a, corrupter, of, the, youth, although, xenophon, claims, to, have, been, present, at, the, symposium, he, was, only, a, young, boy, at, the, date, on, which, he, proposes, xenophon, was, not, present, at, the, trial, of, socrates, having, been, on, campaign, in, anatolia, and, mesopotamia, it, seems, that, xenophon, wrote, his, apology, and, memorabilia, as, defences, of, his, former, teacher, and, to, further, the, philosophic, project, not, to, present, a, literal, transcript, of, socrates, response, to, the, historical, charges, incurred, xenophon, was, a, student, of, socrates, in, his, lives, of, eminent, philosophers, the, greek, biographer, diogenes, la, rtius, who, writes, many, centuries, later, reports, how, xenophon, met, socrates, they, say, that, socrates, met, in, a, narrow, lane, and, put, his, stick, across, it, and, prevented, him, from, passing, by, asking, him, where, all, kinds, of, necessary, things, were, sold, and, when, he, had, answered, him, he, asked, him, again, where, men, were, made, good, and, virtuous, and, as, he, did, not, know, he, said, follow, me, then, and, learn, and, from, this, time, forth, xenophon, became, a, follower, of, socrates, diogenes, la, rtius, also, relates, an, incident, when, in, the, battle, of, delium, xenophon, had, fallen, from, his, horse, and, socrates, reputedly, stepped, in, and, saved, his, life, both, plato, and, xenophon, wrote, apology, concerning, the, death, of, socrates, xenophon, and, plato, seem, to, be, concerned, with, the, failures, of, socrates, to, defend,
