david, mile, durkheim, d, r, k, h, a, m, french, or, 15, april, 1858, 15, november, 1917, professionally, known, simply, as, mile, durkheim, was, a, french, sociologist, durkheim, formally, established, the, academic, discipline, of, sociology, and, is, commonly, cited, as, one, of, the, principal, architects, of, modern, social, science, along, with, both, karl, marx, and, max, weber, much, of, durkheim, s, work, was, concerned, with, how, societies, can, maintain, their, integrity, and, coherence, in, modernity, an, era, in, which, traditional, social, and, religious, ties, are, much, less, universal, and, in, which, new, social, institutions, have, come, into, being, durkheim, s, conception, of, the, scientific, study, of, society, laid, the, groundwork, for, modern, sociology, and, he, used, such, scientific, tools, as, statistics, surveys, and, historical, observation, in, his, analysis, of, suicides, in, catholic, and, protestant, groups, durkheim, s, first, major, sociological, work, was, de, la, division, du, travail, social, 1893, the, division, of, labour, in, society, followed, in, 1895, by, les, r, gles, de, la, m, thode, sociologique, the, rules, of, sociological, method, also, in, 1895, durkheim, set, up, the, first, european, department, of, sociology, and, became, france, s, first, professor, of, sociology, durkheim, s, seminal, monograph, le, suicide, 1897, a, study, of, suicide, rates, in, catholic, and, protestant, populations, especially, pioneered, modern, social, research, serving, to, distinguish, social, science, from, psychology, and, political, philosophy, in, 1898, he, established, the, journal, l, ann, e, sociologique, les, formes, l, mentaires, de, la, vie, religieuse, 1912, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, presented, a, theory, of, religion, comparing, the, social, and, cultural, lives, of, aboriginal, and, modern, societies, durkheim, was, deeply, preoccupied, with, the, acceptance, of, sociology, as, a, legitimate, science, refining, the, positivism, originally, set, forth, by, auguste, comte, 1798, 1857, he, promoted, what, could, be, considered, as, a, form, of, epistemological, realism, as, well, as, the, use, of, the, hypothetico, deductive, model, in, social, science, for, durkheim, sociology, was, the, science, of, institutions, understanding, the, term, in, its, broader, meaning, as, the, beliefs, and, modes, of, behaviour, instituted, by, the, collectivity, with, its, aim, being, to, discover, structural, social, facts, as, such, durkheim, was, a, major, proponent, of, structural, functionalism, a, foundational, perspective, in, both, sociology, and, anthropology, in, his, view, social, science, should, be, purely, holistic, in, the, sense, that, sociology, should, study, phenomena, attributed, to, society, at, large, rather, than, being, limited, to, the, study, of, specific, actions, of, individuals, he, remained, a, dominant, force, in, french, intellectual, life, until, his, death, in, 1917, presenting, numerous, lectures, and, publishing, works, on, a, variety, of, topics, including, the, sociology, of, knowledge, morality, social, stratification, religion, law, education, and, deviance, some, terms, that, he, coined, such, as, collective, consciousness, are, now, also, used, by, laypeople, david, mile, durkheim, was, born, 15, april, 1858, in, pinal, lorraine, france, to, m, lanie, isidor, and, mo, se, durkheim, coming, into, a, long, lineage, of, devout, french, jews, as, his, father, grandfather, and, great, grandfather, had, all, been, rabbis, 1, young, durkheim, began, his, education, in, a, rabbinical, school, however, at, an, early, age, he, switched, schools, deciding, not, to, follow, in, his, family, s, footsteps, 1, in, fact, durkheim, led, a, completely, secular, life, whereby, much, of, his, work, was, dedicated, to, demonstrating, that, religious, phenomena, stemmed, from, social, rather, than, divine, factors, nevertheless, durkheim, did, not, sever, ties, with, his, family, nor, with, the, jewish, community, 1, in, fact, many, of, his, most, prominent, collaborators, and, students, were, jewish, some, even, being, blood, relatives, for, instance, marcel, mauss, a, notable, social, anthropologist, of, the, prewar, era, was, his, nephew, a, precocious, student, durkheim, entered, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, ens, in, 1879, at, his, third, attempt, 2, the, entering, class, that, year, was, one, of, the, most, brilliant, of, the, nineteenth, century, as, many, of, his, classmates, such, as, jean, jaur, s, and, henri, bergson, went, on, to, become, major, figures, in, france, s, intellectual, history, as, well, at, the, ens, durkheim, studied, under, the, direction, of, numa, denis, fustel, de, coulanges, a, classicist, with, a, social, scientific, outlook, and, wrote, his, latin, dissertation, on, montesquieu, at, the, same, time, he, read, auguste, comte, and, herbert, spencer, whereby, durkheim, became, interested, in, a, scientific, approach, to, society, early, on, in, his, career, this, meant, the, first, of, many, conflicts, with, the, french, academic, system, which, had, no, social, science, curriculum, at, the, time, durkheim, found, humanistic, studies, uninteresting, turning, his, attention, from, psychology, and, philosophy, to, ethics, and, eventually, sociology, he, obtained, his, agr, gation, in, philosophy, in, 1882, though, finishing, next, to, last, in, his, graduating, class, owing, to, serious, illness, the, year, before, the, opportunity, for, durkheim, to, receive, a, major, academic, appointment, in, paris, was, inhibited, by, his, approach, to, society, from, 1882, to, 1887, he, taught, philosophy, at, several, provincial, schools, in, 1885, he, decided, to, leave, for, germany, where, for, two, years, he, studied, sociology, at, the, universities, of, marburg, berlin, and, leipzig, as, durkheim, indicated, in, several, essays, it, was, in, leipzig, that, he, learned, to, appreciate, the, value, of, empiricism, and, its, language, of, concrete, complex, things, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, more, abstract, clear, and, simple, ideas, of, the, cartesian, method, by, 1886, as, part, of, his, doctoral, dissertation, he, had, completed, the, draft, of, his, the, division, of, labour, in, society, and, was, working, towards, establishing, the, new, science, of, sociology, durkheim, s, period, in, germany, resulted, in, the, publication, of, numerous, articles, on, german, social, science, and, philosophy, durkheim, was, particularly, impressed, by, the, work, of, wilhelm, wundt, durkheim, s, articles, gained, recognition, in, france, and, he, received, a, teaching, appointment, in, the, university, of, bordeaux, in, 1887, where, he, was, to, teach, the, university, s, first, social, science, course, his, official, title, was, charg, d, un, cours, de, science, sociale, et, de, p, dagogie, thus, he, taught, both, pedagogy, and, sociology, the, latter, having, never, been, taught, in, france, before, 3, the, appointment, of, the, social, scientist, to, the, mostly, humanistic, faculty, was, an, important, sign, of, changing, times, and, the, growing, importance, and, recognition, of, the, social, sciences, from, this, position, durkheim, helped, reform, the, french, school, system, introducing, the, study, of, social, science, in, its, curriculum, however, his, controversial, beliefs, that, religion, and, morality, could, be, explained, in, terms, purely, of, social, interaction, earned, him, many, critics, also, in, 1887, durkheim, married, louise, dreyfus, they, had, two, children, marie, and, andr, the, 1890s, were, a, period, of, remarkable, creative, output, for, durkheim, in, 1893, he, published, the, division, of, labour, in, society, his, doctoral, dissertation, and, fundamental, statement, of, the, nature, of, human, society, and, its, development, x, durkheim, s, interest, in, social, phenomena, was, spurred, on, by, politics, france, s, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, led, to, the, fall, of, the, regime, of, napoleon, iii, which, was, then, replaced, by, the, third, republic, this, in, turn, resulted, in, a, backlash, against, the, new, secular, and, republican, rule, as, many, people, considered, a, vigorously, nationalistic, approach, necessary, to, rejuvenate, france, s, fading, power, durkheim, a, jew, and, a, staunch, supporter, of, the, third, republic, with, a, sympathy, towards, socialism, was, thus, in, the, political, minority, a, situation, that, galvanized, him, politically, the, dreyfus, affair, of, 1894, only, strengthened, his, activist, stance, in, 1895, he, published, the, rules, of, sociological, method, a, manifesto, stating, what, sociology, is, and, how, it, ought, to, be, done, and, founded, the, first, european, department, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, bordeaux, in, 1898, he, founded, l, ann, e, sociologique, the, first, french, social, science, journal, its, aim, was, to, publish, and, publicize, the, work, of, what, was, by, then, a, growing, number, of, students, and, collaborators, this, is, also, the, name, used, to, refer, to, the, group, of, students, who, developed, his, sociological, program, in, 1897, he, published, suicide, a, case, study, that, provided, an, example, of, what, a, sociological, monograph, might, look, like, durkheim, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of, the, use, of, quantitative, methods, in, criminology, which, he, used, in, his, study, of, suicide, by, 1902, durkheim, had, finally, achieved, his, goal, of, attaining, a, prominent, position, in, paris, when, he, became, the, chair, of, education, at, the, sorbonne, durkheim, had, aimed, for, the, position, earlier, but, the, parisian, faculty, took, longer, to, accept, what, some, called, sociological, imperialism, and, admit, social, science, to, their, curriculum, he, became, a, full, professor, specifically, professor, of, the, science, of, education, there, in, 1906, and, in, 1913, he, was, named, chair, in, education, and, sociology, because, french, universities, are, technically, institutions, for, training, secondary, school, teachers, this, position, gave, durkheim, considerable, influence, his, lectures, were, the, only, ones, that, were, mandatory, for, the, entire, student, body, durkheim, had, much, influence, over, the, new, generation, of, teachers, around, that, time, he, also, served, as, an, advisor, to, the, ministry, of, education, in, 1912, he, published, his, last, major, work, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, was, to, have, a, tragic, effect, on, durkheim, s, life, his, leftism, was, always, patriotic, rather, than, internationalist, in, that, he, sought, a, secular, rational, form, of, french, life, however, the, onset, of, the, war, and, the, inevitable, nationalist, propaganda, that, followed, made, it, difficult, to, sustain, this, already, nuanced, position, while, durkheim, actively, worked, to, support, his, country, in, the, war, his, reluctance, to, give, in, to, simplistic, nationalist, fervor, combined, with, his, jewish, background, made, him, a, natural, target, of, the, now, ascendant, french, right, even, more, seriously, the, generations, of, students, that, durkheim, had, trained, were, now, being, drafted, to, serve, in, the, army, many, of, them, perishing, in, the, trenches, finally, durkheim, s, own, son, andr, died, on, the, war, front, in, december, 1915, a, loss, from, which, durkheim, never, recovered, emotionally, devastated, durkheim, collapsed, of, a, stroke, in, paris, two, years, later, on, 15, november, 1917, he, was, buried, at, the, montparnasse, cemetery, in, paris, in, the, rules, of, sociological, method, 1895, durkheim, expressed, his, will, to, establish, a, method, that, would, guarantee, sociology, s, truly, scientific, character, one, of, the, questions, raised, concerns, the, objectivity, of, the, sociologist, how, may, one, study, an, object, that, from, the, very, beginning, conditions, and, relates, to, the, observer, according, to, durkheim, observation, must, be, as, impartial, and, impersonal, as, possible, even, though, a, perfectly, objective, observation, in, this, sense, may, never, be, attained, a, social, fact, must, always, be, studied, according, to, its, relation, with, other, social, facts, never, according, to, the, individual, who, studies, it, sociology, should, therefore, privilege, comparison, rather, than, the, study, of, singular, independent, facts, durkheim, sought, to, create, one, of, the, first, rigorous, scientific, approaches, to, social, phenomena, along, with, herbert, spencer, he, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, explain, the, existence, and, quality, of, different, parts, of, a, society, by, reference, to, what, function, they, served, in, maintaining, the, quotidian, i, e, by, how, they, make, society, work, he, also, agreed, with, spencer, s, organic, analogy, comparing, society, to, a, living, organism, thus, his, work, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, precursor, to, functionalism, durkheim, also, insisted, that, society, was, more, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, unlike, his, contemporaries, ferdinand, t, nnies, and, max, weber, he, did, not, focus, on, what, motivates, the, actions, of, individuals, an, approach, associated, with, methodological, individualism, but, rather, on, the, study, of, social, facts, during, his, university, studies, at, the, ens, durkheim, was, influenced, by, two, neo, kantian, scholars, charles, renouvier, and, mile, boutroux, the, principles, durkheim, absorbed, from, them, included, rationalism, scientific, study, of, morality, anti, utilitarianism, and, secular, education, his, methodology, was, influenced, by, numa, denis, fustel, de, coulanges, a, supporter, of, the, scientific, method, a, fundamental, influence, on, durkheim, s, thought, was, the, sociological, positivism, of, auguste, comte, who, effectively, sought, to, extend, and, apply, the, scientific, method, found, in, the, natural, sciences, to, the, social, sciences, according, to, comte, a, true, social, science, should, stress, empirical, facts, as, well, as, induce, general, scientific, laws, from, the, relationship, among, these, facts, there, were, many, points, on, which, durkheim, agreed, with, the, positivist, thesis, a, second, influence, on, durkheim, s, view, of, society, beyond, comte, s, positivism, was, the, epistemological, outlook, called, social, realism, although, he, never, explicitly, espoused, it, durkheim, adopted, a, realist, perspective, in, order, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, social, realities, outside, the, individual, and, to, show, that, these, realities, existed, in, the, form, of, the, objective, relations, of, society, as, an, epistemology, of, science, realism, can, be, defined, as, a, perspective, that, takes, as, its, central, point, of, departure, the, view, that, external, social, realities, exist, in, the, outer, world, and, that, these, realities, are, independent, of, the, individual, s, perception, of, them, this, view, opposes, other, predominant, philosophical, perspectives, such, as, empiricism, and, positivism, empiricists, like, david, hume, had, argued, that, all, realities, in, the, outside, world, are, products, of, human, sense, perception, thus, all, realities, are, merely, perceived, they, do, not, exist, independently, of, our, perceptions, and, have, no, causal, power, in, themselves, comte, s, positivism, went, a, step, further, by, claiming, that, scientific, laws, could, be, deduced, from, empirical, observations, going, beyond, this, durkheim, claimed, that, sociology, would, not, only, discover, apparent, laws, but, would, be, able, to, discover, the, inherent, nature, of, society, scholars, also, debate, the, exact, influence, of, jewish, thought, on, durkheim, s, work, the, answer, remains, uncertain, some, scholars, have, argued, that, durkheim, s, thought, is, a, form, of, secularized, jewish, thought, while, others, argue, that, proving, the, existence, of, a, direct, influence, of, jewish, thought, on, durkheim, s, achievements, is, difficult, or, impossible, throughout, his, career, durkheim, was, concerned, primarily, with, three, goals, first, to, establish, sociology, as, a, new, academic, discipline, second, to, analyse, how, societies, could, maintain, their, integrity, and, coherence, in, the, modern, era, when, things, such, as, shared, religious, and, ethnic, background, could, no, longer, be, assumed, to, that, end, he, wrote, much, about, the, effect, of, laws, religion, education, and, similar, forces, on, society, and, social, integration, lastly, durkheim, was, concerned, with, the, practical, implications, of, scientific, knowledge, the, importance, of, social, integration, is, expressed, throughout, durkheim, s, work, for, if, society, lacks, the, unity, that, derives, from, the, fact, that, the, relationships, between, its, parts, are, exactly, regulated, that, unity, resulting, from, the, harmonious, articulation, of, its, various, functions, assured, by, effective, discipline, and, if, in, addition, society, lacks, the, unity, based, upon, the, commitment, of, men, s, wills, to, a, common, objective, then, it, is, no, more, than, a, pile, of, sand, that, the, least, jolt, or, the, slightest, puff, will, suffice, to, scatter, durkheim, authored, some, of, the, most, programmatic, statements, on, what, sociology, is, and, how, it, should, be, practiced, his, concern, was, to, establish, sociology, as, a, science, arguing, for, a, place, for, sociology, among, other, sciences, he, wrote, sociology, is, then, not, an, auxiliary, of, any, other, science, it, is, itself, a, distinct, and, autonomous, science, to, give, sociology, a, place, in, the, academic, world, and, to, ensure, that, it, is, a, legitimate, science, it, must, have, an, object, that, is, clear, and, distinct, from, philosophy, or, psychology, and, its, own, methodology, he, argued, that, there, is, in, every, society, a, certain, group, of, phenomena, which, may, be, differentiated, from, those, studied, by, the, other, natural, sciences, 95, in, the, tarde, durkheim, debate, of, 1903, the, anthropological, view, of, gabriel, tarde, was, ridiculed, and, hastily, dismissed, a, fundamental, aim, of, sociology, is, to, discover, structural, social, facts, 13, the, establishment, of, sociology, as, an, independent, recognized, academic, discipline, is, among, durkheim, s, largest, and, most, lasting, legacies, within, sociology, his, work, has, significantly, influenced, structuralism, or, structural, functionalism, a, social, fact, is, every, way, of, acting, fixed, or, not, capable, of, exercising, on, the, individual, an, external, constraint, or, again, every, way, of, acting, which, is, general, throughout, a, given, society, while, at, the, same, time, existing, in, its, own, right, independent, of, its, individual, manifestations, durkheim, s, work, revolved, around, the, study, of, social, facts, a, term, he, coined, to, describe, phenomena, that, have, an, existence, in, and, of, themselves, are, not, bound, to, the, actions, of, individuals, but, have, a, coercive, influence, upon, them, durkheim, argued, that, social, facts, have, sui, generis, an, independent, existence, greater, and, more, objective, than, the, actions, of, the, individuals, that, compose, society, only, such, social, facts, can, explain, the, observed, social, phenomena, being, exterior, to, the, individual, person, social, facts, may, thus, also, exercise, coercive, power, on, the, various, people, composing, society, as, it, can, sometimes, be, observed, in, the, case, of, formal, laws, and, regulations, but, also, in, situations, implying, the, presence, of, informal, rules, such, as, religious, rituals, or, family, norms, unlike, the, facts, studied, in, natural, sciences, a, social, fact, thus, refers, to, a, specific, category, of, phenomena, the, determining, cause, of, a, social, fact, must, be, sought, among, the, antecedent, social, facts, and, not, among, the, states, of, the, individual, consciousness, such, facts, are, endowed, with, a, power, of, coercion, by, reason, of, which, they, may, control, individual, behaviors, according, to, durkheim, these, phenomena, cannot, be, reduced, to, biological, or, psychological, grounds, social, facts, can, be, material, i, e, physical, objects, or, immaterial, i, e, meanings, sentiments, etc, though, the, latter, cannot, be, seen, or, touched, they, are, external, and, coercive, thus, becoming, real, and, gaining, facticity, physical, objects, too, can, represent, both, material, and, immaterial, social, facts, for, example, a, flag, is, a, physical, social, fact, that, is, often, ingrained, with, various, immaterial, social, facts, e, g, its, meaning, and, importance, many, social, facts, however, have, no, material, form, even, the, most, individualistic, or, subjective, phenomena, such, as, love, freedom, or, suicide, were, regarded, by, durkheim, as, objective, social, facts, individuals, composing, society, do, not, directly, cause, suicide, suicide, as, a, social, fact, exists, independently, in, society, and, is, caused, by, other, social, facts, such, as, rules, governing, behavior, and, group, attachment, whether, an, individual, likes, it, or, not, whether, a, person, leaves, a, society, does, not, alter, the, fact, that, this, society, will, still, contain, suicides, suicide, like, other, immaterial, social, facts, exists, independently, of, the, will, of, an, individual, cannot, be, eliminated, and, is, as, influential, coercive, as, physical, laws, like, gravity, sociology, s, task, therefore, consists, of, discovering, the, qualities, and, characteristics, of, such, social, facts, which, can, be, discovered, through, a, quantitative, or, experimental, approach, durkheim, extensively, relied, on, statistics, regarding, the, society, itself, like, social, institutions, in, general, durkheim, saw, it, as, a, set, of, social, facts, even, more, than, what, society, is, durkheim, was, interested, in, answering, how, is, a, society, created, and, what, holds, a, society, together, in, the, division, of, labour, in, society, durkheim, attempts, to, answer, the, latter, question, durkheim, assumes, that, humans, are, inherently, egoistic, while, collective, consciousness, i, e, norms, beliefs, and, values, forms, the, moral, basis, of, the, society, resulting, in, social, integration, collective, consciousness, is, therefore, of, key, importance, to, the, society, its, requisite, function, without, which, the, society, cannot, survive, this, consciousness, produces, the, society, and, holds, it, together, while, at, the, same, time, individuals, produce, collective, consciousness, through, their, interactions, through, collective, consciousness, human, beings, become, aware, of, one, another, as, social, beings, not, just, animals, the, totality, of, beliefs, and, sentiments, common, to, the, average, members, of, a, society, forms, a, determinate, system, with, a, life, of, its, own, it, can, be, termed, the, collective, or, common, consciousness, in, particular, the, emotional, part, of, the, collective, consciousness, overrides, our, egoism, as, we, are, emotionally, bound, to, culture, we, act, socially, because, we, recognize, it, is, the, responsible, moral, way, to, act, a, key, to, forming, society, is, social, interaction, and, durkheim, believes, that, human, beings, when, in, a, group, will, inevitably, act, in, such, a, way, that, a, society, is, formed, groups, when, interacting, create, their, own, culture, and, attach, powerful, emotions, to, it, thus, making, culture, another, key, social, fact, durkheim, was, one, of, the, first, scholars, to, consider, the, question, of, culture, so, intensely, durkheim, was, interested, in, cultural, diversity, and, how, the, existence, of, diversity, nonetheless, fails, to, destroy, a, society, to, that, durkheim, answered, that, any, apparent, cultural, diversity, is, overridden, by, a, larger, common, and, more, generalized, cultural, system, and, the, law, in, a, socio, evolutionary, approach, durkheim, described, the, evolution, of, societies, from, mechanical, solidarity, to, organic, solidarity, one, rising, from, mutual, need, as, societies, become, more, complex, evolving, from, mechanical, to, organic, solidarity, the, division, of, labour, is, counteracting, and, replacing, to, collective, consciousness, in, the, simpler, societies, people, are, connected, to, others, due, to, personal, ties, and, traditions, in, the, larger, modern, society, they, are, connected, due, to, increased, reliance, on, others, with, regard, to, them, performing, their, specialized, tasks, needed, for, the, modern, highly, complex, society, to, survive, in, mechanical, solidarity, people, are, self, sufficient, there, is, little, integration, and, thus, there, is, the, need, for, use, of, force, and, repression, to, keep, society, together, also, in, such, societies, people, have, much, fewer, options, in, life, in, organic, solidarity, people, are, much, more, integrated, and, interdependent, and, specialization, and, cooperation, are, extensive, progress, from, mechanical, to, organic, solidarity, is, based, first, on, population, growth, and, increasing, population, density, second, on, increasing, morality, density, development, of, more, complex, social, interactions, and, thirdly, on, the, increasing, specialization, in, workplace, one, of, the, ways, mechanical, and, organic, societies, differ, is, the, function, of, law, in, mechanical, society, the, law, is, focused, on, its, punitive, aspect, and, aims, to, reinforce, the, cohesion, of, the, community, often, by, making, the, punishment, public, and, extreme, whereas, in, the, organic, society, the, law, focuses, on, repairing, the, damage, done, and, is, more, focused, on, individuals, than, the, community, one, of, the, main, features, of, the, modern, organic, society, is, the, importance, sacredness, even, given, to, the, concept, social, fact, of, the, individual, the, individual, rather, than, the, collective, becomes, the, focus, of, rights, and, responsibilities, the, center, of, public, and, private, rituals, holding, the, society, together, a, function, once, performed, by, the, religion, to, stress, the, importance, of, this, concept, durkheim, talked, of, the, cult, of, the, individual, thus, very, far, from, there, being, the, antagonism, between, the, individual, and, society, which, is, often, claimed, moral, individualism, the, cult, of, the, individual, is, in, fact, the, product, of, society, itself, it, is, society, that, instituted, it, and, made, of, man, the, god, whose, servant, it, is, durkheim, saw, the, population, density, and, growth, as, key, factors, in, the, evolution, of, the, societies, and, advent, of, modernity, as, the, number, of, people, in, a, given, area, increase, so, does, the, number, of, interactions, and, the, society, becomes, more, complex, growing, competition, between, the, more, numerous, people, also, leads, to, further, division, of, labour, in, time, the, importance, of, the, state, the, law, and, the, individual, increases, while, that, of, the, religion, and, moral, solidarity, decreases, in, another, example, of, evolution, of, culture, durkheim, pointed, to, fashion, although, in, this, case, he, noted, a, more, cyclical, phenomenon, according, to, durkheim, fashion, serves, to, differentiate, between, lower, classes, and, upper, classes, but, because, lower, classes, want, to, look, like, the, upper, classes, they, will, eventually, adapt, the, upper, class, fashion, depreciating, it, and, forcing, the, upper, class, to, adopt, a, new, fashion, as, the, society, durkheim, noted, there, are, several, possible, pathologies, that, could, lead, to, a, breakdown, of, social, integration, and, disintegration, of, the, society, the, two, most, important, ones, are, anomie, and, forced, division, of, labour, lesser, ones, include, the, lack, of, coordination, and, suicide, to, durkheim, anomie, refers, to, a, lack, of, social, norms, where, too, rapid, of, population, growth, reduces, the, amount, of, interaction, between, various, groups, which, in, turn, leads, to, a, breakdown, of, understanding, i, e, norms, values, etc, forced, division, of, labour, on, the, other, hand, refers, to, a, situation, in, which, those, who, hold, power, driven, by, their, desire, for, profit, greed, results, in, people, doing, work, that, they, are, unsuited, for, such, people, are, unhappy, and, their, desire, to, change, the, system, can, destabilize, the, society, durkheim, s, views, on, crime, were, a, departure, from, conventional, notions, he, believed, that, crime, is, bound, up, with, the, fundamental, conditions, of, all, social, life, and, serves, a, social, function, 101, he, states, that, crime, implies, not, only, that, the, way, remains, open, to, necessary, changes, but, that, in, certain, cases, it, directly, prepares, these, changes, 101, examining, the, trial, of, socrates, he, argues, that, his, crime, namely, the, independence, of, his, thought, rendered, a, service, not, only, to, humanity, but, to, his, country, as, it, served, to, prepare, a, new, morality, and, faith, that, the, athenians, needed, 101, as, such, his, crime, was, a, useful, prelude, to, reforms, 102, in, this, sense, he, saw, crime, as, being, able, to, release, certain, social, tensions, and, so, have, a, cleansing, or, purging, effect, in, society, 101, the, authority, which, the, moral, conscience, enjoys, must, not, be, excessive, otherwise, no, one, would, dare, to, criticize, it, and, it, would, too, easily, congeal, into, an, immutable, form, to, make, progress, individual, originality, must, be, able, to, express, itself, the, originality, of, the, criminal, shall, also, be, possible, durkheim, thought, deviance, to, be, an, essential, component, of, a, functional, society, he, believed, that, deviance, had, three, possible, effects, on, society, durkheim, s, thoughts, on, deviance, contributed, to, robert, merton, s, strain, theory, in, suicide, 1897, durkheim, explores, the, differing, suicide, rates, among, protestants, and, catholics, arguing, that, stronger, social, control, among, catholics, results, in, lower, suicide, rates, according, to, durkheim, catholic, society, has, normal, levels, of, integration, while, protestant, society, has, low, levels, overall, durkheim, treated, suicide, as, a, social, fact, explaining, variations, in, its, rate, on, a, macro, level, considering, society, scale, phenomena, such, as, lack, of, connections, between, people, group, attachment, and, lack, of, regulations, of, behavior, rather, than, individuals, feelings, and, motivations, durkheim, believed, there, was, more, to, suicide, than, extremely, personal, individual, life, circumstances, such, as, loss, of, a, job, divorce, or, bankruptcy, instead, durkheim, explained, suicide, as, a, symptom, of, collective, social, deviance, like, alcoholism, or, homicide, he, created, a, normative, theory, of, suicide, focusing, on, the, conditions, of, group, life, proposing, four, different, types, of, suicide, which, include, egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and, fatalistic, durkheim, began, his, theory, by, plotting, social, regulation, on, the, x, axis, of, his, chart, and, social, integration, on, the, y, axis, this, study, has, been, extensively, discussed, by, later, scholars, and, several, major, criticisms, have, emerged, first, durkheim, took, most, of, his, data, from, earlier, researchers, notably, adolph, wagner, and, henry, morselli, who, were, much, more, careful, in, generalizing, from, their, own, data, second, later, researchers, found, that, the, protestant, catholic, differences, in, suicide, seemed, to, be, limited, to, german, speaking, europe, and, thus, may, have, always, been, the, spurious, reflection, of, other, factors, durkheim, s, study, of, suicide, has, been, criticized, as, an, example, of, the, logical, error, termed, the, ecological, fallacy, however, diverging, views, have, contested, whether, durkheim, s, work, really, contained, an, ecological, fallacy, more, recent, authors, such, as, berk, 2006, have, also, questioned, the, micro, macro, relations, underlying, durkheim, s, work, some, such, as, inkeles, 1959, johnson, 1965, and, gibbs, 1968, have, claimed, that, durkheim, s, only, intent, was, to, explain, suicide, sociologically, within, a, holistic, perspective, emphasizing, that, he, intended, his, theory, to, explain, variation, among, social, environments, in, the, incidence, of, suicide, not, the, suicides, of, particular, individuals, despite, its, limitations, durkheim, s, work, on, suicide, has, influenced, proponents, of, control, theory, and, is, often, mentioned, as, a, classic, sociological, study, the, book, pioneered, modern, social, research, and, served, to, distinguish, social, science, from, psychology, and, political, philosophy, ch, 1, in, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, 1912, durkheim, s, first, purpose, was, to, identify, the, social, origin, and, function, of, religion, as, he, felt, that, religion, was, a, source, of, camaraderie, and, solidarity, his, second, purpose, was, to, identify, links, between, certain, religions, in, different, cultures, finding, a, common, denominator, he, wanted, to, understand, the, empirical, social, aspect, of, religion, that, is, common, to, all, religions, and, goes, beyond, the, concepts, of, spirituality, and, god, durkheim, defined, religion, as, a, unified, system, of, beliefs, and, practices, relative, to, sacred, things, i, e, things, set, apart, and, forbidden, beliefs, and, practices, which, unite, in, one, single, moral, community, called, a, church, all, those, who, adhere, to, them, in, this, definition, durkheim, avoids, references, to, supernatural, or, god, durkheim, rejected, earlier, definitions, by, tylor, that, religion, was, belief, in, supernatural, beings, finding, that, primitive, societies, such, as, the, australian, aborigines, following, the, ethnologies, of, spencer, and, gillen, largely, discredited, later, did, not, divide, reality, into, natural, vs, supernatural, realms, but, rather, into, realms, of, the, sacred, and, the, profane, which, were, not, moral, categories, since, both, could, include, what, was, good, or, evil, durkheim, argues, we, are, left, with, the, following, three, concepts, out, of, those, three, concepts, durkheim, focused, on, the, sacred, noting, that, it, is, at, the, very, core, of, a, religion, 322, they, are, only, collective, forces, hypostasized, that, is, to, say, moral, forces, they, are, made, up, of, the, ideas, and, sentiments, awakened, in, us, by, the, spectacle, of, society, and, not, of, sensations, coming, from, the, physical, world, durkheim, saw, religion, as, the, most, fundamental, social, institution, of, humankind, and, one, that, gave, rise, to, other, social, forms, it, was, religion, that, gave, humanity, the, strongest, sense, of, collective, consciousness, durkheim, saw, religion, as, a, force, that, emerged, in, the, early, hunter, gatherer, societies, as, the, emotions, collective, effervescence, run, high, in, the, growing, groups, forcing, them, to, act, in, a, new, ways, and, giving, them, a, sense, of, some, hidden, force, driving, them, over, time, as, emotions, became, symbolized, and, interactions, ritualized, religion, became, more, organized, giving, a, rise, to, the, division, between, the, sacred, and, the, profane, however, durkheim, also, believed, that, religion, was, becoming, less, important, as, it, was, being, gradually, superseded, by, science, and, the, cult, of, an, individual, thus, there, is, something, eternal, in, religion, which, is, destined, to, survive, all, the, particular, symbols, in, which, religious, thought, has, successively, enveloped, itself, 427, however, even, if, the, religion, was, losing, its, importance, for, durkheim, it, still, laid, the, foundation, of, modern, society, and, the, interactions, that, governed, it, and, despite, the, advent, of, alternative, forces, durkheim, argued, that, no, replacement, for, the, force, of, religion, had, yet, been, created, he, expressed, his, doubt, about, modernity, seeing, the, modern, times, as, a, period, of, transition, and, moral, mediocrity, durkheim, also, argued, that, our, primary, categories, for, understanding, the, world, have, their, origins, in, religion, it, is, religion, durkheim, writes, that, gave, rise, to, most, if, not, all, other, social, constructs, including, the, larger, society, durkheim, argued, that, categories, are, produced, by, the, society, and, thus, are, collective, creations, thus, as, people, create, societies, they, also, create, categories, but, at, the, same, time, they, do, so, unconsciously, and, the, categories, are, prior, to, any, individual, s, experience, in, this, way, durkheim, attempted, to, bridge, the, divide, between, seeing, categories, as, constructed, out, of, human, experience, and, as, logically, prior, to, that, experience, our, understanding, of, the, world, is, shaped, by, social, facts, for, example, the, notion, of, time, is, defined, by, being, measured, through, a, calendar, which, in, turn, was, created, to, allow, us, to, keep, track, of, our, social, gatherings, and, rituals, those, in, turn, on, their, most, basic, level, originated, from, religion, in, the, end, even, the, most, logical, and, rational, pursuit, of, science, can, trace, its, origins, to, religion, durkheim, states, that, religion, gave, birth, to, all, that, is, essential, in, the, society, in, his, work, durkheim, focused, on, totemism, the, religion, of, the, aboriginal, australians, and, native, americans, durkheim, saw, this, religion, as, the, most, ancient, religion, and, focused, on, it, as, he, believed, its, simplicity, would, ease, the, discussion, of, the, essential, elements, of, religion, as, such, he, wrote, 220, now, the, totem, is, the, flag, of, the, clan, it, is, therefore, natural, that, the, impressions, aroused, by, the, clan, in, individual, minds, impressions, of, dependence, and, of, increased, vitality, should, fix, themselves, to, the, idea, of, the, totem, rather, than, that, of, the, clan, for, the, clan, is, too, complex, a, reality, to, be, represented, clearly, in, all, its, complex, unity, by, such, rudimentary, intelligences, durkheim, s, work, on, religion, was, criticized, on, both, empirical, and, theoretical, grounds, by, specialists, in, the, field, the, most, important, critique, came, from, durkheim, s, contemporary, arnold, van, gennep, an, expert, on, religion, and, ritual, and, also, on, australian, belief, systems, van, gennep, argued, that, durkheim, s, views, of, primitive, peoples, and, simple, societies, were, entirely, erroneous, van, gennep, further, argued, that, durkheim, demonstrated, a, lack, of, critical, stance, towards, his, sources, collected, by, traders, and, priests, naively, accepting, their, veracity, and, that, durkheim, interpreted, freely, from, dubious, data, at, the, conceptual, level, van, gennep, pointed, out, durkheim, s, tendency, to, press, ethnography, into, a, prefabricated, theoretical, scheme, despite, such, critiques, durkheim, s, work, on, religion, has, been, widely, praised, for, its, theoretical, insight, and, whose, arguments, and, propositions, according, to, robert, alun, jones, have, stimulated, the, interest, and, excitement, of, several, generations, of, sociologists, irrespective, of, theoretical, school, or, field, of, specialization, while, durkheim, s, work, deals, with, a, number, of, subjects, including, suicide, the, family, social, structures, and, social, institutions, a, large, part, of, his, work, deals, with, the, sociology, of, knowledge, while, publishing, short, articles, on, the, subject, earlier, in, his, career, durkheim, s, definitive, statement, concerning, the, sociology, of, knowledge, comes, in, his, 1912, magnum, opus, the, elementary, forms, of, religious, life, this, book, has, as, its, goal, not, only, the, elucidation, of, the, social, origins, and, function, of, religion, but, also, the, social, origins, and, impact, of, society, on, language, and, logical, thought, durkheim, worked, largely, out, of, a, kantian, framework, and, sought, to, understand, how, the, concepts, and, categories, of, logical, thought, could, arise, out, of, social, life, he, argued, for, example, that, the, categories, of, space, and, time, were, not, a, priori, rather, the, category, of, space, depends, on, a, society, s, social, grouping, and, geographical, use, of, space, and, a, group, s, social, rhythm, that, determines, our, understanding, of, time, in, this, durkheim, sought, to, combine, elements, of, rationalism, and, empiricism, arguing, that, certain, aspects, of, logical, thought, common, to, all, humans, did, exist, but, that, they, were, products, of, collective, life, thus, contradicting, the, tabula, rasa, empiricist, understanding, whereby, categories, are, acquired, by, individual, experience, alone, and, that, they, were, not, universal, a, prioris, as, kant, argued, since, the, content, of, the, categories, differed, from, society, to, society, another, key, elements, to, durkheim, s, theory, of, knowledge, outlined, in, elementary, forms, is, the, concept, of, repr, sentations, collectives, collective, representations, repr, sentations, collectives, are, the, symbols, and, images, that, come, to, represent, the, ideas, beliefs, and, values, elaborated, by, a, collectivity, and, are, not, reducible, to, individual, constituents, they, can, include, words, slogans, ideas, or, any, number, of, material, items, that, can, serve, as, a, symbol, such, as, a, cross, a, rock, a, temple, a, feather, etc, as, durkheim, elaborates, repr, sentations, collectives, are, created, through, intense, social, interaction, and, are, products, of, collective, activity, as, such, these, representations, have, the, particular, and, somewhat, contradictory, aspect, that, they, exist, externally, to, the, individual, since, they, are, created, and, controlled, not, by, the, individual, but, by, society, as, a, whole, yet, simultaneously, within, each, individual, of, the, society, by, virtue, of, that, individual, s, participation, within, society, arguably, the, most, important, repr, sentations, collectives, is, language, which, according, to, durkheim, is, a, product, of, collective, action, and, because, language, is, a, collective, action, language, contains, within, it, a, history, of, accumulated, knowledge, and, experience, that, no, individual, would, be, capable, of, creating, on, their, own, 435, if, concepts, were, only, general, ideas, they, would, not, enrich, knowledge, a, great, deal, for, as, we, have, already, pointed, out, the, general, contains, nothing, more, than, the, particular, but, if, before, all, else, they, are, collective, representations, they, add, to, that, which, we, can, learn, by, our, own, personal, experience, all, that, wisdom, and, science, which, the, group, has, accumulated, in, the, course, of, centuries, thinking, by, concepts, is, not, merely, seeing, reality, on, its, most, general, side, but, it, is, projecting, a, light, upon, the, sensation, which, illuminates, it, penetrates, it, and, transforms, it, as, such, language, as, a, social, product, literally, structures, and, shapes, our, experience, of, reality, this, discursive, approach, to, language, and, society, was, developed, by, later, french, philosophers, such, as, michel, foucault, durkheim, defines, morality, as, a, system, of, rules, for, conduct, his, analysis, of, morality, is, strongly, marked, by, immanuel, kant, and, his, notion, of, duty, while, durkheim, was, influenced, by, kant, he, was, highly, critical, of, aspects, of, the, latter, s, moral, theory, and, developed, his, own, positions, durkheim, agrees, with, kant, that, within, morality, there, is, an, element, of, obligation, a, moral, authority, which, by, manifesting, itself, in, certain, precepts, particularly, important, to, it, confers, upon, an, obligatory, character, 38, morality, tells, us, how, to, act, from, a, position, of, superiority, there, exists, a, certain, pre, established, moral, norm, to, which, we, must, conform, it, is, through, this, view, that, durkheim, makes, a, first, critique, of, kant, in, saying, that, moral, duties, originate, in, society, and, are, not, to, be, found, in, some, universal, moral, concept, such, as, the, categorical, imperative, durkheim, also, argues, that, morality, is, characterized, not, just, by, this, obligation, but, is, also, something, that, is, desired, by, the, individual, the, individual, believes, that, by, adhering, to, morality, they, are, serving, the, common, good, and, for, this, reason, the, individual, submits, voluntarily, to, the, moral, commandment, 54, however, in, order, to, accomplish, its, aims, morality, must, be, legitimate, in, the, eyes, of, those, to, whom, it, speaks, as, durkheim, argues, this, moral, authority, is, primarily, to, be, located, in, religion, which, is, why, in, any, religion, one, finds, a, code, of, morality, for, durkheim, it, is, only, society, that, has, the, resources, the, respect, and, the, power, to, cultivate, within, an, individual, both, the, obligatory, and, the, desirous, aspects, of, morality, 73, durkheim, has, had, an, important, impact, on, the, development, of, anthropology, and, sociology, as, disciplines, the, establishment, of, sociology, as, an, independent, recognized, academic, discipline, in, particular, is, among, durkheim, s, largest, and, most, lasting, legacies, within, sociology, his, work, has, significantly, influenced, structuralism, or, structural, functionalism, scholars, inspired, by, durkheim, include, marcel, mauss, maurice, halbwachs, c, lestin, bougl, gustave, belot, alfred, radcliffe, brown, talcott, parsons, robert, k, merton, jean, piaget, claude, l, vi, strauss, ferdinand, de, saussure, michel, foucault, clifford, geertz, peter, berger, social, reformer, patrick, hunout, and, others, more, recently, durkheim, has, influenced, sociologists, such, as, steven, lukes, robert, n, bellah, and, pierre, bourdieu, his, description, of, collective, consciousness, also, deeply, influenced, ziya, g, kalp, the, founder, of, turkish, sociology, who, replaced, durkheim, s, concept, of, society, with, nation, an, ideologue, who, provided, the, intellectual, justification, for, the, ottoman, empire, s, wars, of, aggression, and, massive, demographic, engineering, including, the, armenian, genocide, he, could, be, considered, to, pervert, durkheim, s, ideas, randall, collins, has, developed, a, theory, of, what, he, calls, interaction, ritual, chains, a, synthesis, of, durkheim, s, work, on, religion, with, that, of, erving, goffman, s, micro, sociology, goffman, himself, was, also, deeply, influenced, by, durkheim, in, his, development, of, the, interaction, order, outside, of, sociology, durkheim, has, influenced, philosophers, including, henri, bergson, and, emmanuel, levinas, and, his, ideas, can, be, identified, inexplicitly, in, the, work, of, certain, structuralist, theorists, of, the, 1960s, such, as, alain, badiou, louis, althusser, and, michel, foucault, much, of, durkheim, s, work, remains, unacknowledged, in, philosophy, despite, its, direct, relevance, as, proof, one, can, look, to, john, searle, whose, book, the, construction, of, social, reality, elaborates, a, theory, of, social, facts, and, collective, representations, that, searle, believed, to, be, a, landmark, work, that, would, bridge, the, gap, between, analytic, and, continental, philosophy, neil, gross, however, demonstrates, how, searle, s, views, on, society, are, more, or, less, a, reconstitution, of, durkheim, s, theories, of, social, facts, social, institutions, collective, representations, and, the, like, searle, s, ideas, are, thus, open, to, the, same, criticisms, as, durkheim, s, searle, responded, by, arguing, that, durkheim, s, work, was, worse, than, he, had, originally, believed, and, admitting, that, he, had, not, read, much, of, durkheim, s, work, because, durkheim, s, account, seemed, so, impoverished, i, did, not, read, any, further, in, his, work, stephen, lukes, however, responded, to, searle, s, reply, to, gross, refuting, point, by, point, the, allegations, that, searle, makes, against, durkheim, essentially, upholding, the, argument, of, gross, that, searle, s, work, bears, great, resemblance, to, that, of, durkheim, lukes, attributes, searle, s, miscomprehension, of, durkheim, s, work, to, the, fact, that, searle, quite, simply, never, read, durkheim, margaret, gilbert, a, contemporary, british, philosopher, of, social, phenomena, has, offered, a, close, sympathetic, reading, of, durkheim, s, discussion, of, social, facts, in, the, first, chapter, and, the, prefaces, of, the, rules, of, sociological, method, in, her, 1989, book, on, social, facts, the, title, of, which, may, represent, an, homage, to, durkheim, alluding, to, his, faits, sociaux, gilbert, argues, that, some, of, his, statements, that, may, seem, to, be, philosophically, untenable, are, important, and, fruitful, published, posthumously
