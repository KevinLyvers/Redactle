he, was, elected, president, of, the, mystery, writers, of, america, chandler, had, an, immense, stylistic, influence, on, american, popular, literature, he, is, a, founder, of, the, hardboiled,

the, list, the, latter, novel, was, praised, in, an, anthology, of, american, crime, stories, as, arguably, the, first, book, since, hammett, s, the, glass, key, published, more, than, twenty, years, earlier, to, qualify, as, a, serious, and, significant, mainstream, novel, that, just, happened, to, possess, elements, of, mystery, chandler, was, also, a, perceptive, critic, of, detective, fiction, his, the, simple, art, of, murder, is, the, canonical, essay, in, the, field, in, it, he, wrote, down, these, mean, streets, a, man, must, go, who, is, not, himself, mean, who, is, neither, tarnished, nor, afraid, the, detective, must, be, a, complete, man, and, a, common, man, and, yet, an, unusual, man, he, must, be, to, use, a, rather, weathered, phrase, a, man, of, honor, by, instinct, by, inevitability, without, thought, of, it, and, certainly, without, saying, it, he, must, be, the, best, man, in, his, world, and, a, good, enough, man, for, any, world, parker, wrote, that, with, marlowe, chandler, seems, to, have, created, the, culminating, american, hero, wised, up, hopeful, thoughtful, adventurous, sentimental, cynical, and, rebellious, an, innocent, who, knows, better, a, romantic, who, is, tough, enough, to, sustain, romanticism, in, a, world, that, has, seen, the, eternal, footman, hold, its, coat, and, snicker, living, at, the, end, of, the, far, west, where, the, american, dream, ran, out, of, room, no, hero, has, ever, been, more, congruent, with, his, landscape, chandler, had, the, right, hero, in, the, right, place, and, engaged, him, in, the, consideration, of, good, and, evil, at, precisely, the, time, when, our, central, certainty, of, good, no, longer, held, chandler, was, born, in, 1888, in, chicago, the, son, of, florence, dart,

and, continued, writing, romantic, poetry, an, encounter, with, the, slightly, older, richard, barham, middleton, is, said, to, have, influenced, him, into, postponing, his, career, as, writer, i, met, also, a, young, bearded, and, sad, eyed, man, called, richard, middleton, shortly, afterwards, he, committed, suicide, in, antwerp, a, suicide, of, despair, i, should, say, the, incident, made, a, great, impression, on, me, because, middleton, struck, me, as, having, far, more, talent, than, i, was, ever, likely, to, possess, and, if, he, couldn, t, make, a, go, of, it, it, wasn, t, very, likely, that, i, could, accounting, for, that, time, he, said, of, course, in, those, days, as, now, there, were, clever, young, men, who, made, a, decent, living, as, freelances, for, the, numerous, literary, weeklies, but, i, was, distinctly, not, a, clever, young, man, nor, was, i, at, all, a, happy, young, man, in, 1912, he, borrowed, money, from, his, waterford, uncle, who, expected, it, to,

senior, and, the, stepmother, of, gordon, pascal, with, whom, chandler, had, enlisted, cissy, amicably, divorced, her, husband, julian, in, 1920, but, chandler, s, mother, disapproved, of, the,

1923, he, was, free, to, marry, cissy, they, were, married, on, february, 6, 1924, having, begun, in, 1922, as, a, bookkeeper, and, auditor, chandler, was, by, 1931, a, highly, paid, vice, president, of, the, dabney, oil, syndicate, but, his, alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity, with, female, employees, and, threatened, suicides, contributed, to, his, dismissal, a, year, later, in, straitened, financial, circumstances, during, the, great, depression, chandler, turned, to, his, latent, writing, talent, to, earn, a, living, teaching, himself, to, write, pulp, fiction, by, analyzing, and, imitating, a, novelette, by, erle, stanley, gardner, chandler, s, first, professional, work, blackmailers, don, t, shoot, was, published, in, black, mask, magazine, in, 1933, according, to, genre, historian, herbert, ruhm, chandler, who, worked, slowly, and, painstakingly, revising, again, and, again, had, taken, five, months, to, write, the, story, erle, stanley, gardner, could, turn, out, a, pulp, story, in, three, or, four, days, and, turned, out, an, estimated, one, thousand, his, first, novel, the, big, sleep, was, published, in, 1939, featuring, the, detective, philip, marlowe, speaking, in, the, first, person, in, 1950, chandler, described, in, a, letter, to, his, english, publisher, hamish, hamilton, why, he, began, reading, pulp, magazines, and, later, wrote, for, them, wandering, up, and, down, the, pacific, coast, in, an, automobile, i, began, to, read, pulp, magazines, because, they, were, cheap, enough, to, throw, away, and, because, i, never, had, at, any, time, any, taste, for, the, kind, of, thing, which, is, known, as, women, s, magazines, this, was, in, the, great, days, of, the, black, mask, if, i, may, call, them, great, days, and, it, struck, me, that, some, of, the, writing, was, pretty, forceful, and, honest, even, though, it, had, its, crude, aspect, i, decided, that, this, might, be, a, good, way, to, try, to, learn, to, write, fiction, and, get, paid, a, small, amount, of, money, at, the, same, time, i, spent, five, months, over, an, 18, 000, word, novelette, and, sold, it, for, 180, after, that, i, never, looked, back, although, i, had, a, good, many, uneasy, periods, looking, forward, his, second, marlowe, novel, farewell, my, lovely, 1940, became, the, basis, for, three, movie, versions, adapted, by, other, screenwriters, including, the, 1944, film, murder, my, sweet, which, marked, the, screen, debut, of, the, marlowe, character, played, by, dick, powell, whose, depiction, of, marlowe, was, applauded, by, chandler, literary, success, and, film, adaptations, led, to, a, demand, for, chandler, himself, as, a, screenwriter, he, and, billy, wilder, co, wrote, double, indemnity, 1944, based, on, james, m, cain, s, novel, of, the, same, title, the, noir, screenplay, was, nominated, for, an, academy, award, said, wilder, i, would, just, guide, the, structure, and, i, would, also, do, a, lot, of, the, dialogue, and, he, chandler, would, then, comprehend, and, start, constructing, too, wilder, acknowledged, that, the, dialogue, which, makes, the, film, so, memorable, was, largely, chandler, s, chandler, s, only, produced, original, screenplay, was, the, blue, dahlia, 1946, he, had, not, written, a, denouement, for, the, script, and, according, to, producer, john, houseman, chandler, concluded, he, could, finish, the, script, only, if, drunk, with, the, assistance, of, round, the, clock, secretaries, and, drivers, which, houseman, agreed, to, the, script, gained, chandler, s, second, academy,

made, a, show, of, throwing, chandler, s, two, draft, screenplays, into, the, studio, trash, can, while, holding, his, nose, but, chandler, retained, the, lead, screenwriting, credit, along, with, czenzi, ormonde, in, 1946, the, chandlers, moved, to, la, jolla, an, affluent, coastal, neighborhood, of, san, diego, california, where, chandler, wrote, two, more, philip, marlowe, novels, the, long,

a, cry, for, help, given, that, he, called, the, police, beforehand, saying, he, planned, to, kill, himself, chandler, s, personal, and, professional, life, were, both, helped, and, complicated, by,

her, children, is, still, at, the, head, of, his, grave, the, new, one, is, at, the, foot, in, his, introduction, to, trouble, is, my, business, 1950, a, collection, of, many, of, his, short, stories, chandler, provided, insight, on, the, formula, for, the, detective, story, and, how, the, pulp, magazines, differed, from, previous, detective, stories, the, emotional, basis, of, the, standard, detective, story, was, and, had, always, been, that, murder, will, out, and, justice, will, be, done, its, technical, basis, was, the, relative, insignificance, of, everything, except, the, final, denouement, what, led, up, to, that, was, more, or, less, passage, work, the, denouement, would, justify, everything, the, technical, basis, of, the, black, mask, type, of, story, on, the, other, hand, was, that, the, scene, outranked, the, plot, in, the, sense, that, a, good, plot, was, one, which, made, good, scenes, the, ideal, mystery, was, one, you, would, read, if, the, end, was, missing, we, who, tried, to, write, it, had, the, same, point, of, view, as, the, film, makers, when, i, first, went, to, hollywood, a, very, intelligent, producer, told, me, that, you, couldn, t, make, a, successful, motion, picture, from, a, mystery, story, because, the, whole, point, was, a, disclosure, that, took, a, few, seconds, of, screen, time, while, the, audience, was, reaching, for, its, hat, he, was, wrong, but, only, because, he, was, thinking, of, the, wrong, kind, of, mystery, chandler, also, described, the, struggle, that, writers, of, pulp, fiction, had, in, following, the, formula, demanded, by, the, editors, of, the, pulp, magazines, as, i, look, back, on, my, stories, it, would, be, absurd, if, i, did, not, wish, they, had, been, better, but, if, they, had, been, much, better, they, would, not, have, been, published, if, the, formula, had, been, a, little, less, rigid, more, of, the, writing, of, that, time, might, have, survived, some, of, us, tried, pretty, hard, to, break, out, of, the, formula, but, we, usually, got, caught, and, sent, back, to, exceed, the, limits, of, a, formula, without, destroying, it, is, the, dream, of, every, magazine, writer, who, is, not, a, hopeless, hack, critics, and, writers, including, w, h, auden, evelyn, waugh, and, ian, fleming, greatly, admired, chandler, s, prose, in, a, radio, discussion, with, chandler, fleming, said, that, chandler, offered, some, of, the, finest, dialogue, written, in, any, prose, today, contemporary, mystery, writer, paul, levine, has, described, chandler, s, style, as, the, literary, equivalent, of, a, quick, punch, to, the, gut, chandler, s, swift, moving, hardboiled, style, was, inspired, mostly, by, dashiell, hammett, but, his, sharp, and, lyrical, similes, are, original, the, muzzle, of, the, luger, looked, like, the, mouth, of, the, second, street, tunnel, he, had, a, heart, as, big, as, one, of, mae, west, s, hips, dead, men, are, heavier, than, broken, hearts, i, went, back, to, the, seasteps, and, moved, down, them, as, cautiously, as, a, cat, on, a, wet, floor, he, was, crazy, as, a, pair, of, waltzing, mice, but, i, liked, him, i, felt, like, an, amputated, leg, he, was, about, as, inconspicuous, as, a, tarantula, on, a, slice, of, angel, food, chandler, s, writing, redefined, the, private, eye, fiction, genre, led, to, the, coining, of, the, adjective, chandleresque, and, inevitably, became, the, subject, of, parody, and, pastiche, yet, the, detective, philip, marlowe, is, not, a, stereotypical, tough, guy, but, a, complex, sometimes, sentimental, man, with, few, friends, who, attended, university, who, speaks, some, spanish, and, sometimes, admires, mexicans, and, blacks, and, who, is, a, student, of, chess, and, classical, music, he, is, a, man, who, refuses, a, prospective, client, s, fee, for, a, job, he, considers, unethical, the, high, regard, in, which, chandler, is, generally, held, today, is, in, contrast, to, the, critical, sniping, that, stung, the, author, during, his, lifetime, in, a, march, 1942, letter, to, blanche, knopf, published, in, selected, letters, of, raymond, chandler, he, wrote, the, thing, that, rather, gets, me, down, is, that, when, i, write, something, that, is, tough, and, fast, and, full, of, mayhem, and, murder, i, get, panned, for, being, tough, and, fast, and, full, of, mayhem, and, murder, and, then, when, i, try, to, tone, down, a, bit, and, develop, the, mental, and, emotional, side, of, a, situation, i, get, panned, for, leaving, out, what, i, was, panned, for, putting, in, the, first, time, although, his, work, enjoys, general, acclaim, today, chandler, has, been, criticized, for, certain, aspects, of, his, writing, the, washington, post, reviewer, patrick, anderson, described, his, plots, as, rambling, at, best, and, incoherent, at, worst, notoriously, even, chandler, did, not, know, who, murdered, the, chauffeur, in, the, big, sleep, and, anderson, criticized, chandler, s, treatment, of, black, female, and, homosexual, characters, calling, him, a, rather, nasty, man, at, times, anderson, nevertheless, praised, chandler, as, probably, the, most, lyrical, of, the, major, crime, writers, chandler, s, short, stories, and, novels, are, evocatively, written, conveying, the, time, place, and, ambiance, of, los, angeles, and, environs, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, places, are, real, if, pseudonymous, bay, city, is, santa, monica, gray, lake, is, silver, lake, and, idle, valley, a, synthesis, of, wealthy, san, fernando, valley, communities, playback, is, the, only, one, of, his, novels, not, to, have, been, made, into, a, movie, arguably, the, most, notable, adaptation, is, howard, hawks, the, big, sleep, 1946, with, humphrey, bogart, as, marlowe, william, faulkner, and, leigh, brackett, were, co, writers, of, the, screenplay, chandler, s, few, screenwriting, efforts, and, the, cinematic, adaptation, of, his, novels, proved, stylistically, and, thematically, influential, on, the, american, film, noir, genre, notable, for, its, revised, take, on, marlowe, is, robert, altman, s, 1973, neo, noir, adaptation, of, the, long, goodbye, chandler, left, an, unfinished, novel, when, he, died, this, was, completed, by, robert, b, parker, and, published, in, 1989, as, poodle, springs
