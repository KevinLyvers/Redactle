spd, bernstein, had, held, close, association, to, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, but, he, began, to, identify, what, he, believed, to, be, errors, in, marxist, thinking, and, began, to, criticize, views, held, by, marxism, when, he, investigated, and, challenged, the, marxist, materialist, theory, of, history, he, rejected, significant, parts, of, marxist, theory, that, were, based, upon, hegelian, metaphysics, and, rejected, the, hegelian, perspective, of, an, immanent, economic, necessity, to, socialism, bernstein, was, born, in, berlin, kreuzberg, to, jewish, parents, who, were, active, in, the, reform, temple, on, the, johannistrasse, whose, services, were, performed, on, sunday, his, father, was, a, locomotive, driver, from, 1866, to, 1878, he, was, employed, in, banks, as, a, banker, s, clerk, after, leaving, school, bernstein, s, political, career, began, in, 1872, when, he, joined, a, socialist, party, with, marxist, tendencies, known, formally, as, the, social, democratic, workers, party, of, germany, the, party, was, a, proponent, of, the, eisenacher, style, of, german, socialism, named, after, the, german, town, where, it, was, founded, bernstein, soon, became, known, as, an, activist, his, party, contested, two, elections, against, a, rival, socialist, party, the, lassalleans, ferdinand, lassalle, s, general, german, workers, association, but, in, both, elections, neither, party, was, able, to, win, a, significant, majority, of, the, left, wing, vote, consequently, bernstein, together, with, august, bebel, and, wilhelm, liebknecht, prepared, the, einigungsparteitag, unification, party, congress, with, the, lassalleans, in, gotha, in, 1875, karl, marx, s, famous, critique, of, the, gotha, program, criticized, what, he, saw, as, a, lassallean, victory, over, the, eisenachers, whom, he, favoured, bernstein, later, noted, that, it, was, liebknecht, considered, by, many, to, be, the, strongest, marxist, advocate, within, the, eisenacher, faction, who, proposed, the, inclusion, of, many, of, the, ideas, that, so, thoroughly, irritated, marx, in, the, 1877, elections, the, german, social, democratic, party, spd, gained, 493, 000, votes, however, two, assassination, attempts, on, kaiser, wilhelm, i, the, next, year, provided, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, a, pretext, to, introduce, a, law, banning, all, socialist, organizations, assemblies, and, publications, there, had, been, no, social, democratic, involvement, in, either, assassination, attempt, but, the, popular, reaction, against, enemies, of, the, reich, induced, a, compliant, reichstag, to, approve, bismarck, s, anti, socialist, laws, bismarck, s, strict, anti, socialist, legislation, was, passed, on, 12, october, 1878, for, nearly, all, practical, purposes, the, spd, was, outlawed, and, it, was, actively, suppressed, throughout, germany, however, it, was, still, possible, for, social, democrats, to, campaign, as, individuals, for, election, to, the, reichstag, which, they, did, in, spite, of, severe, persecution, the, party, actually, increased, its, electoral, success, gaining, 550, 000, votes, in, 1884, and, 763, 000, in, 1887, the, vehemence, of, bernstein, s, opposition, to, the, government, of, bismarck, made, it, desirable, for, him, to, leave, germany, shortly, before, the, anti, socialist, laws, came, into, effect, bernstein, went, into, exile, in, zurich, accepting, a, position, as, the, private, secretary, of, karl, h, chberg, a, wealthy, supporter, of, social, democracy, a, warrant, subsequently, issued, for, his, arrest, ruled, out, any, possibility, for, him, to, return, to, germany, and, he, was, to, remain, in, exile, for, more, than, 20, years, in, 1888, bismarck, convinced, the, swiss, government, to, expel, a, number, of, important, members, of, german, social, democracy, and, so, bernstein, relocated, to, london, where, he, associated, with, friedrich, engels, and, karl, kautsky, it, was, soon, after, his, arrival, in, switzerland, that, he, began, to, think, of, himself, as, a, marxist, in, 1880, he, accompanied, bebel, to, london, to, clear, up, a, misunderstanding, concerning, his, involvement, with, an, article, published, by, h, chberg, that, was, denounced, by, marx, and, engels, as, being, chock, full, of, bourgeois, and, petty, bourgeois, ideas, the, visit, was, a, success, and, engels, in, particular, was, impressed, by, bernstein, s, zeal, and, ideas, back, in, zurich, bernstein, became, increasingly, active, in, working, for, der, sozialdemokrat, social, democrat, and, later, succeeded, georg, von, vollmar, as, the, paper, s, editor, which, he, was, for, 10, years, it, was, during, those, years, between, 1880, and, 1890, that, bernstein, established, his, reputation, as, a, major, party, theoretician, and, a, marxist, of, impeccable, orthodoxy, he, was, helped, in, that, by, the, close, personal, and, professional, relationship, he, established, with, engels, the, relationship, owed, much, to, the, fact, that, he, shared, engels, s, strategic, vision, and, accepted, most, of, the, particular, policies, that, engels, believed, the, ideas, to, entail, in, 1887, the, german, government, persuaded, the, swiss, authorities, to, ban, der, sozialdemokrat, bernstein, moved, to, london, where, he, resumed, publication, from, premises, in, kentish, town, his, relationship, with, engels, soon, developed, into, friendship, he, also, communicated, with, various, english, socialist, organizations, notably, the, fabian, society, and, henry, mayers, hyndman, s, social, democratic, federation, in, later, years, his, opponents, routinely, claimed, that, his, revisionism, was, caused, by, seeing, the, world, through, english, spectacles, however, bernstein, denied, the, charges, in, 1895, engels, was, deeply, distressed, when, he, discovered, that, his, introduction, to, a, new, edition, of, the, class, struggles, in, france, written, by, marx, in, 1850, had, been, edited, by, bernstein, and, kautsky, in, a, manner, that, left, the, impression, that, he, had, become, a, proponent, of, a, peaceful, road, to, socialism, on, 1, april, 1895, four, months, before, his, death, engels, wrote, to, kautsky, i, was, amazed, to, see, today, in, the, vorw, rts, an, excerpt, from, my, introduction, that, had, been, printed, without, my, knowledge, and, tricked, out, in, such, a, way, as, to, present, me, as, a, peace, loving, proponent, of, legality, quand, m, me, at, all, costs, which, is, all, the, more, reason, why, i, should, like, it, to, appear, in, its, entirety, in, the, neue, zeit, in, order, that, this, disgraceful, impression, may, be, erased, i, shall, leave, liebknecht, in, no, doubt, as, to, what, i, think, about, it, and, the, same, applies, to, those, who, irrespective, of, who, they, may, be, gave, him, this, opportunity, of, perverting, my, views, and, what, s, more, without, so, much, as, a, word, to, me, about, it, in, 1891, bernstein, was, one, of, the, authors, of, the, erfurt, program, and, from, 1896, to, 1898, he, published, a, series, of, articles, entitled, probleme, des, sozialismus, problems, of, socialism, that, resulted, in, the, revisionism, debate, in, the, spd, he, also, published, the, book, die, voraussetzungen, des, sozialismus, und, die, aufgaben, der, sozialdemokratie, the, prerequisites, for, socialism, and, the, tasks, of, social, democracy, in, 1899, the, book, was, in, great, contrast, to, the, positions, of, bebel, kautsky, and, liebknecht, rosa, luxemburg, s, 1900, essay, reform, or, revolution, was, also, a, polemic, against, bernstein, s, position, in, 1900, bernstein, published, zur, geschichte, und, theorie, des, sozialismus, the, history, and, theory, of, socialism, in, 1901, bernstein, returned, to, germany, after, the, end, of, the, ban, that, had, kept, him, from, entering, the, country, he, became, an, editor, of, the, newspaper, vorw, rts, that, year, and, a, member, of, the, reichstag, from, 1902, to, 1918, he, voted, against, the, armament, tabling, in, 1913, together, with, the, spd, fraction, s, left, wing, although, he, voted, for, war, credits, in, august, 1914, he, opposed, world, war, i, from, july, 1915, and, in, 1917, was, among, the, founders, of, the, independent, social, democratic, party, of, germany, uspd, which, united, antiwar, socialists, including, reformists, like, bernstein, centrists, like, kautsky, and, revolutionary, socialists, like, rosa, luxemburg, and, karl, liebknecht, he, was, a, member, of, the, uspd, until, 1919, when, he, rejoined, the, spd, from, 1920, to, 1928, bernstein, was, again, a, member, of, the, reichstag, on, 4, march, 1920, as, an, expert, on, anglo, german, relations, under, the, german, empire, he, became, a, member, of, the, parliamentary, committee, investigating, the, war, guilt, question, he, was, one, of, only, a, few, deputies, on, the, committee, to, admit, germany, s, responsibility, for, the, outbreak, of, war, setting, himself, apart, from, the, majority, of, reichstag, members, in, the, bourgeois, parties, he, retired, from, political, life, in, 1928, bernstein, died, on, 18, december, 1932, in, berlin, a, commemorative, plaque, is, placed, in, his, memory, at, bozener, stra, e, 18, berlin, sch, neberg, where, he, lived, from, 1918, until, his, death, his, grave, in, the, eisackstrasse, cemetery, became, a, grave, of, honour, german, ehrengrab, in, berlin, die, voraussetzungen, des, sozialismus, 1899, was, bernstein, s, most, significant, work, bernstein, was, principally, concerned, with, refuting, karl, marx, s, predictions, about, the, imminent, and, inevitable, demise, of, capitalism, and, marx, s, consequent, laissez, faire, policy, which, opposed, ameliorative, social, interventions, before, the, demise, bernstein, indicated, simple, facts, which, he, considered, to, be, evidence, that, marx, s, predictions, were, not, being, borne, out, while, he, noted, that, while, the, centralization, of, capitalist, industry, was, significant, it, was, not, becoming, wholescale, and, that, the, ownership, of, capital, was, becoming, more, and, not, less, diffuse, bernstein, s, analysis, of, agriculture, according, to, which, bernstein, believed, that, land, ownership, was, becoming, less, concentrated, was, largely, based, on, the, work, of, eduard, david, and, was, in, its, marshalling, of, facts, impressive, enough, that, even, his, orthodox, marxist, opponent, karl, kautsky, acknowledged, its, value, as, to, marx, s, belief, in, the, disappearance, of, the, middleman, bernstein, declared, that, the, entrepreneur, class, was, being, steadily, recruited, from, the, proletariat, class, and, so, all, compromise, measures, such, as, the, state, regulation, of, the, hours, of, labour, and, provisions, for, old, age, pensions, should, be, encouraged, for, that, reason, bernstein, urged, the, labouring, classes, to, take, an, active, interest, in, politics, bernstein, also, indicated, what, he, considered, to, be, some, of, the, flaws, in, marx, s, labour, theory, of, value, looking, especially, at, the, rapid, growth, in, germany, bernstein, argued, that, middle, sized, firms, would, flourish, the, size, and, power, of, the, middle, class, would, grow, and, that, capitalism, would, successfully, adjust, and, not, collapse, he, warned, that, a, violent, proletarian, revolution, as, in, france, in, 1848, produced, only, reactionary, successes, which, undermined, workers, interests, therefore, he, rejected, revolution, and, instead, insisted, the, best, strategy, to, be, patiently, building, up, a, durable, social, movement, working, for, continuous, nonviolent, incremental, change, in, his, work, the, quest, for, evolutionary, socialism, eduard, bernstein, and, social, democracy, manfred, steger, touches, on, bernstein, s, desire, for, socialism, through, peaceful, means, and, incremental, legislation, some, say, that, is, marxism, in, its, mature, form, after, the, revisionists, claimed, many, of, marx, s, theories, to, be, wrong, and, came, up, with, theories, of, their, own, including, socialism, coming, through, democratic, means, bernstein, was, vilified, by, the, orthodox, marxists, led, by, karl, kautsky, as, well, as, the, more, radical, current, led, by, rosa, luxemburg, for, his, revisionism, nonetheless, bernstein, remained, very, much, a, socialist, albeit, an, unorthodox, one, as, he, believed, that, socialism, would, be, achieved, by, the, advancement, of, capitalism, to, social, democracy, and, so, on, not, by, capitalism, s, destruction, as, rights, were, gradually, won, by, workers, their, cause, for, grievance, would, be, diminished, and, consequently, so, too, would, the, motivation, for, revolution, during, the, intra, party, debates, about, his, ideas, bernstein, explained, that, for, him, the, final, goal, of, socialism, was, nothing, progress, toward, that, goal, was, everything, luxemburg, argued, that, socialism, has, its, end, in, social, revolution, and, revisionism, amounts, in, practice, to, the, advice, that, we, abandon, the, social, revolution, the, goal, of, social, democracy, and, turn, social, reform, from, a, means, of, the, class, struggle, into, its, final, aim, she, says, revisionism, has, lost, sight, of, scientific, socialism, and, reverted, to, idealism, and, therefore, lost, its, predictive, force, since, reformists, underestimate, the, anarchy, of, capitalism, and, say, it, has, adaptability, and, viability, by, which, they, mean, that, the, contradictions, of, capitalism, would, not, of, historical, necessity, drive, it, to, its, doom, luxemburg, said, they, would, abandon, the, objective, necessity, for, socialism, and, give, up, all, hope, for, a, socialist, future, the, movement, would, collapse, unless, revisionism, is, repudiated, trade, unionists, who, could, see, the, successes, of, capitalism, and, the, improvement, of, working, conditions, and, who, wanted, to, improve, working, conditions, through, parliament, generally, followed, bernstein, while, those, who, were, more, orthodox, generally, followed, luxemburg, foreign, policy, was, bernstein, s, main, intellectual, interest, between, 1902, and, 1914, with, many, articles, in, the, sozialistische, monatshefte, socialist, monthly, he, advocated, policy, positions, for, germany, that, were, aggressively, nationalist, imperialist, and, expansionist, bernstein, considered, protectionism, high, tariffs, on, imports, as, helping, only, a, selective, few, being, fortschrittsfeindlich, anti, progressive, for, its, negative, effects, on, the, masses, he, argued, germany, s, protectionism, was, based, only, on, political, expediency, isolating, germany, from, the, world, especially, from, britain, creating, an, autarky, that, would, result, only, in, conflict, between, germany, and, the, rest, of, the, world, bernstein, wanted, to, end, germany, s, protectionism, and, argued, that, tariffs, did, not, increase, grain, production, did, not, counter, british, competition, did, not, increase, farm, profits, and, did, not, promote, improvements, in, farming, instead, it, inflated, rents, interest, rates, and, prices, hurting, everyone, involved, in, contrast, he, argued, that, free, trade, led, to, peace, democracy, prosperity, and, the, highest, material, and, moral, well, being, of, all, humanity, bernstein, rejected, reactionary, bourgeois, nationalism, and, called, instead, for, a, cosmopolitan, libertarian, nationalism, he, recognized, the, historical, role, of, the, national, factor, and, said, that, the, proletariat, must, support, their, country, against, external, dangers, he, called, on, workers, to, assimilate, themselves, within, nation, states, which, entailed, support, for, colonial, policies, and, imperial, projects, bernstein, was, sympathetic, to, the, idea, of, imperial, expansions, as, a, positive, and, civilizing, mission, which, resulted, in, a, bitter, series, of, polemics, with, the, anti, imperialist, ernest, belfort, bax, bernstein, supported, colonialism, as, he, believed, it, uplifted, backward, peoples, and, it, worked, well, for, both, britain, and, germany, bernstein, supported, such, policies, in, an, intensely, racialized, manner, arguing, in, 1896, that, races, who, are, hostile, to, or, incapable, of, civilisation, cannot, claim, our, sympathy, when, they, revolt, against, civilisation, and, that, the, savages, be, subjugated, and, made, to, conform, to, the, rules, of, higher, civilisation, however, he, was, disturbed, by, the, kaiser, s, reckless, policies, he, wanted, strong, friendship, especially, with, britain, and, france, and, protection, against, the, russian, threat, to, germany, he, envisioned, a, sort, of, league, of, nations, bernstein, s, views, on, jewish, matters, evolved, he, never, identified, as, a, zionist, but, after, initially, favouring, a, wholly, assimilationist, solution, to, the, jewish, question, his, attitude, toward, zionism, became, considerably, more, sympathetic, after, world, war, i, bernstein, is, also, noted, for, being, one, of, the, first, socialists, to, deal, sympathetically, with, the, issue, of, homosexuality
