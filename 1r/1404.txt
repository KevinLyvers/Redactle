the, basic, governmental, structure, of, the, new, republic, of, indonesia, sukarno, s, vision, for, the, 1945, indonesian, constitution, comprised, the, pancasila, five, principles, sukarno, s, political, philosophy, was, mainly, a, fusion, of, elements, of, marxism, nationalism, and, islam, this, is, reflected, in, a, proposition, of, his, version, of, pancasila, he, proposed, to, the, bpupk, in, a, speech, on, 1, june, 1945, sukarno, argued, that, all, of, the, principles, of, the, nation, could, be, summarised, in, the, phrase, gotong, royong, the, indonesian, parliament, founded, on, the, basis, of, this, original, and, subsequently, revised, constitution, proved, all, but, ungovernable, this, was, due, to, irreconcilable, differences, between, various, social, political, religious, and, ethnic, factions, in, the, days, following, the, proclamation, the, news, of, indonesian, independence, was, spread, by, radio, newspaper, leaflets, and, word, of, mouth, despite,

sukarno, government, quickly, established, governmental, control, while, the, remaining, japanese, mostly, retreated, to, their, barracks, awaiting, the, arrival, of, allied, forces, this, period, was, marked, by, constant, attacks, by, armed, groups, on, anyone, who, were, perceived, to, oppose, indonesian, independence, the, most, serious, cases, were, the, social, revolutions, in, aceh, and, north, sumatera, where, large, numbers, of, acehnese, and, malay, aristocrats, were, killed, and, the, three, regions, affair, in, northwestern, coast, of, central, java, these, bloody, incidents, continued, until, late, 1945, to, early, 1946, and, begin, to, peter, out, as, republican, authorities, begin, to, exert, and, consolidate, control, sukarno, s, government, initially, postponed, the, formation, of, a, national, army, for, fear, of, antagonizing, the, allied, occupation, forces, and, their, doubt, over, whether, they, would, have, been, able, to, form, an, adequate, military, apparatus, to, maintain, control, of, seized, territory, the, members, of, various, militia, groups, formed, during, japanese, occupation, such, as, the, disbanded, peta, and, heiho, at, that, time,

tkr, armed, themselves, mostly, by, attacking, japanese, troops, and, confiscating, their, weapons, due, to, the, sudden, transfer, of, java, and, sumatra, from, general, douglas, macarthur, s,

new, country, rather, than, engage, in, battle, with, british, and, dutch, military, forces, sukarno, was, aware, that, his, history, as, a, japanese, collaborator, and, his, leadership, in, the, japanese, approved, putera, during, the, occupation, would, make, the, western, countries, distrustful, of, him, to, help, gain, international, recognition, as, well, as, to, accommodate, domestic, demands, for, representation, sukarno, allowed, the, formation, of, a, parliamentary, system, of, government, whereby, a, prime, minister, controlled, day, to, day, affairs, of, the, government, while, sukarno, as, president, remained, as, a, figurehead, the, prime, minister, and, his, cabinet, would, be, responsible, to, the, central, indonesian, national, committee, instead, of, the,

publicly, called, for, the, immediate, formation, of, such, a, force, on, 17, may, 1965, however, army, chief, ahmad, yani, and, defence, minister, nasution, procrastinated, in, implementing, this,

sukarno, himself, was, contemptuous, of, macroeconomics, and, was, unable, and, unwilling, to, provide, practical, solutions, to, the, poor, economic, condition, of, the, country, instead, he, produced, more, ideological, conceptions, such, as, trisakti, political, sovereignty, economic, self, sufficiency, and, cultural, independence, he, advocated, indonesians, standing, on, their, own, feet, berdikari, and, achieving, economic, self, sufficiency, free, from, foreign, influence, towards, the, end, of, his, rule, sukarno, s, lack, of, interest, in, economics, created, a, distance, between, himself, and, the, indonesian, people, who, were, suffering, economically, his, face, had, become, bloated, by, disease, and, his, flamboyance, and, sexual, conquests, which, had, once,
