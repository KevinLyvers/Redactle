houses, of, common, citizens, one, of, rainilaiarivony, s, daughters, died, in, her, twenties, following, a, self, induced, abortion, and, the, rest, married, and, lived, quiet, lives, out, of, public, view, the, february, 1852, death, of, prime, minister, rainiharo, left, the, queen, without, her, consort, long, time, political, adviser, and, military, commander, in, chief, she, consequently, awarded, rainilaiarivony, a, double, promotion, to, twelfth, honor, ten, days, afterward, in, preparation, for, an, increase, in, military, and, political, responsibilities, shortly, thereafter, the, queen, expressed, romantic, interest, in, rainilaiarivony, and, proposed, that, he, assume, the, former, role, of, his, father, as, consort, and, prime, minister, the, young, man, refused, on, the, double, basis, of, their, age, difference, as, well, as, the, perceived, impropriety, of, becoming, intimate, with, his, father, s, former, lover, ranavalona, continued, to, harbor, feelings, for, him, throughout, her, lifetime, but, she, did, not, express, resentment, over, his, refusal, to, reciprocate, them, and, went, on, to, take, another, high, ranking, official, as, consort, rainijohary, who, was, jointly, awarded, the, role, of, prime, minister, along, with, the, new, commander, in, chief, rainivoninahitriniony, within, a, year, the, queen, had, assigned, the, 24, year, old, rainilaiarivony, to, his, first, position, of, responsibility, within, the, military, and, promoted, him, to, royal, secretary, keeper, of, the, royal, seal, and, supervisor, to, the, royal, treasurer, several, years, prior, to, his, death, former, prime, minister, rainiharo, had, led, military, campaigns, to, bring, the, peoples, of, the, south, under, merina, control, strong, military, campaigns, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, had, concluded, in, a, peace, agreement, between, the, merina, armies, and, those, of, the, bara, people, of, the, central, southern, highlands, who, were, accorded, semi, autonomous, status, in, exchange, for, serving, as, a, buffer, between, the, sakalava, to, the, west, and, the, tanala, antemoro, antefasy, and, other, ethnic, groups, to, the, southeast, upon, learning, of, rainiharo, s, death, disgruntled, southeastern, factions, rose, up, against, the, merina, military, stationed, at, posts, within, their, territory, queen, ranavalona, responded, by, sending, rainivoninahitriniony, and, rainilaiarivony, on, their, first, military, expedition, to, liberate, the, besieged, merina, colonists, and, quell, the, uprising, under, the, brothers, joint, command, were, ten, thousand, soldiers, armed, with, muskets, and, another, thousand, carrying, swords, an, additional, 80, 000, porters, cooks, servants, and, other, support, staff, accompanied, the, army, throughout, the, massive, campaign, over, 10, 000, were, killed, by, merina, soldiers, in, the, campaign, and, according, to, custom, numerous, women, and, children, were, captured, to, be, sold, into, slavery, in, imerina, rainilaiarivony, took, 80, slaves, while, his, older, brother, took, more, than, 160, however, the, campaign, was, only, partly, successful, in, pacifying, the, region, and, the, merina, hold, over, the, outlying, areas, of, the, island, remained, tenuous, throughout, the, 19th, century, as, the, queen, s, son, radama, grew, to, adulthood, he, became, increasingly, disillusioned, by, the, high, death, toll, of, his, mother, s, military, campaigns, and, traditional, measures, of, justice, and, was, frustrated, by, her, unilateral, rejection, of, european, influence, the, young, prince, developed, sympathetic, relationships, with, the, handful, of, europeans, permitted, by, ranavalona, to, frequent, her, court, namely, jean, laborde, and, joseph, fran, ois, lambert, with, whom, he, privately, concluded, the, lucrative, lambert, charter, the, charter, which, would, come, into, effect, upon, radama, s, accession, to, the, throne, granted, lambert, large, tracts, of, land, and, exclusive, rights, to, road, construction, mineral, extraction, timber, harvesting, and, other, activities, on, the, island, in, may, 1857, when, rainilaiarivony, was, 29, years, old, lambert, consequently, invited, prince, radama, rainivoninahitriniony, rainilaiarivony, and, a, number, of, other, officers, to, conspire, with, him, in, a, plot, to, overthrow, ranavalona, on, the, eve, of, the, coup, rainivoninahitriniony, informed, lambert, that, he, could, not, guarantee, the, support, of, the, army, and, that, the, plot, should, be, aborted, one, of, the, officers, believed, the, brothers, had, betrayed, them, and, sought, to, exonerate, himself, by, notifying, the, queen, of, the, failed, conspiracy, she, reacted, by, expelling, the, foreigners, from, the, island, and, subjecting, all, the, implicated, merina, officers, to, the, tangena, ordeal, in, which, they, were, forced, to, swallow, a, poison, to, determine, their, guilt, or, innocence, rainilaiarivony, and, his, brother, were, excepted, from, this, and, remained, like, her, son, radama, in, the, queen, s, confidence, for, the, few, remaining, years, of, her, life, in, the, summer, of, 1861, when, rainilaiarivony, was, 33, years, old, queen, ranavalona, s, advanced, age, and, acute, illness, produced, speculation, about, who, would, succeed, her, ranavalona, had, repeatedly, stated, her, intention, that, her, progressive, and, pro, european, son, radama, ii, would, be, her, successor, much, to, the, chagrin, of, the, conservative, faction, at, court, the, conservatives, privately, rallied, behind, the, queen, s, nephew, and, adoptive, son, ramboasalama, whom, the, queen, had, initially, declared, heir, apparent, some, years, prior, and, who, had, never, abandoned, hope, to, one, day, reclaim, the, right, that, had, briefly, been, accorded, to, him, according, to, custom, pretenders, to, the, throne, had, historically, been, put, to, death, upon, the, naming, of, a, new, sovereign, radama, was, opposed, to, this, practice, and, asked, the, brothers, to, help, ensure, his, accession, to, the, throne, with, minimum, bloodshed, on, the, day, of, the, queen, s, death, rainilaiarivony, successfully, maintained, authority, over, the, palace, guards, anxiously, awaiting, the, command, from, either, faction, to, slaughter, the, other, when, the, queen, s, attendant, quietly, informed, him, that, her, final, moments, were, approaching, rainilaiarivony, discreetly, summoned, radama, and, rainivoninahitriniony, from, the, prime, minister, s, palace, to, the, royal, rova, compound, and, ordered, the, prince, crowned, before, the, gathered, soldiers, just, as, the, queen, was, pronounced, dead, ramboasalama, was, promptly, escorted, to, the, palace, where, he, was, obliged, to, publicly, swear, allegiance, to, king, radama, rainilaiarivony, was, made, responsible, for, the, tribunal, where, ramboasalama, s, supporters, were, tried, convicted, of, subversion, and, sentenced, to, banishment, and, other, punishments, ramboasalama, was, sent, to, live, with, his, wife, ramatoa, rasoaray, rainilaiarivony, s, sister, in, the, distant, highland, village, of, ambohimirimo, where, he, died, in, april, 1862, rainijohary, the, former, prime, minister, and, consort, of, ranavalona, was, relieved, of, his, rank, and, exiled, leaving, his, co, minister, rainivoninahitriniony, as, the, sole, prime, minister, at, the, same, time, rainilaiarivony, was, promoted, by, radama, to, the, position, of, commander, in, chief, of, the, military, rainilaiarivony, the, father, of, the, one, who, has, the, flower, was, indeed, a, queen, maker, he, selected, elevated, and, married, the, last, three, beginning, with, rasoherina, arthur, stratton, the, great, red, island, 1964, as, commander, in, chief, rainilaiarivony, maintained, a, distance, from, politics, throughout, the, reign, of, the, new, monarch, radama, ii, instead, preferring, to, focus, on, his, military, responsibilities, meanwhile, disputes, between, prime, minister, rainivoninahitriniony, and, king, radama, grew, frequent, as, the, young, sovereign, pursued, radical, reforms, that, had, begun, to, foment, displeasure, among, the, traditional, masses, the, situation, came, to, a, head, on, 7, may, 1863, when, radama, insisted, on, legalizing, duels, despite, widespread, concern, among, the, king, s, advisers, that, the, innovation, would, lead, to, anarchy, the, prime, minister, initiated, the, arrest, of, the, menamaso, the, prince, s, influential, advisers, while, rainilaiarivony, enacted, his, brother, s, instructions, to, keep, the, peace, in, the, capital, city, however, the, situation, deteriorated, in, dramatic, fashion, and, by, the, morning, of, 12, may, king, radama, ii, was, declared, dead, having, been, strangled, on, the, prime, minister, s, orders, not, having, been, involved, in, the, coup, d, tat, rainilaiarivony, provided, direction, for, his, brother, and, the, rest, of, the, court, as, they, grappled, with, the, gravity, of, their, acts, he, proposed, that, future, monarchs, would, no, longer, have, absolute, power, but, would, instead, rule, by, the, consent, of, the, nobles, a, series, of, terms, were, proposed, by, rainilaiarivony, that, the, nobles, agreed, to, impose, on, radama, s, widow, rasoherina, under, rainilaiarivony, s, new, monarchy, a, sovereign, required, the, consent, of, the, nobles, to, issue, a, death, sentence, or, promulgate, a, new, law, and, was, forbidden, to, disband, the, army, the, new, power, sharing, agreement, was, concluded, by, a, political, marriage, between, the, queen, and, the, prime, minister, because, of, the, new, limitations, placed, on, future, merina, monarchs, by, rainilaiarivony, and, the, hova, courtiers, radama, s, strangling, represented, more, than, a, simple, coup, d, tat, the, ruling, conditions, imposed, on, rasoherina, reflected, a, power, shift, toward, the, oligarchs, of, the, hova, commoner, class, and, away, from, the, andriana, sovereigns, who, had, traditionally, drawn, their, legitimacy, from, the, deeply, held, cultural, belief, that, the, royal, line, was, imbued, with, hasina, a, sacred, authority, bestowed, by, the, ray, aman, dreny, ancestors, in, this, respect, the, new, political, structure, in, imerina, embodied, the, erosion, of, certain, traditional, social, values, among, the, merina, elite, who, had, gained, exposure, to, contemporary, european, political, thought, and, assimilated, a, number, of, western, governance, principles, it, also, signalled, the, expansion, of, a, rift, between, the, pro, european, progressive, elite, to, which, rainilaiarivony, and, his, brother, belonged, and, the, majority, of, the, population, in, madagascar, for, whom, traditional, values, such, as, hasina, remained, integral, to, determining, the, legitimacy, of, a, government, a, divide, that, would, deepen, in, the, decades, to, come, through, rainilaiarivony, s, efforts, to, effect, a, modernizing, political, and, social, transformation, on, a, nationwide, scale, rainivoninahitriniony, s, tenure, as, sole, prime, minister, was, short, lived, his, violent, tendencies, irritability, and, insolence, toward, rasoherina, in, addition, to, lingering, popular, resentment, over, rainivoninahitriniony, s, role, in, the, violent, end, to, radama, s, rule, gradually, turned, the, opinion, of, the, nobles, against, him, as, commander, in, chief, rainilaiarivony, attempted, to, counsel, his, brother, while, simultaneously, overseeing, diplomatic, and, military, efforts, to, re, pacify, the, agitated, sakalava, and, other, peoples, who, viewed, the, coup, as, an, indication, of, weakening, merina, control, the, prime, minister, repaid, these, efforts, by, repeatedly, castigating, high, ranking, officers, and, even, threatening, rainilaiarivony, with, his, sword, two, of, rainilaiarivony, s, cousins, urged, him, to, take, his, elder, brother, s, place, in, order, to, end, the, shame, that, rainivoninahitriniony, s, behavior, was, bringing, upon, their, family, after, weighing, the, idea, rainilaiarivony, approached, rasoherina, with, the, proposal, the, queen, readily, consented, and, lent, her, assistance, in, rallying, the, support, of, the, nobles, at, court, on, 14, july, 1864, little, more, than, a, year, after, the, coup, rasoherina, deposed, and, divorced, rainivoninahitriniony, then, exiled, the, fallen, minister, the, following, year, rainilaiarivony, was, promoted, to, prime, minister, the, arrangement, was, sealed, when, rainilaiarivony, took, rasoherina, as, his, bride, and, demoted, his, longtime, spouse, rasoanalina, to, the, status, of, second, wife, rainilaiarivony, confided, in, a, friend, shortly, before, his, death, that, he, deeply, loved, his, first, wife, and, came, to, share, the, same, degree, of, feeling, toward, rasoherina, as, well, but, never, developed, the, same, affection, for, the, subsequent, queens, he, married, none, of, his, royal, spouses, bore, him, any, children, by, taking, this, new, role, rainilaiarivony, became, the, first, hova, to, concurrently, serve, as, both, prime, minister, and, commander, in, chief, the, sociopolitical, transformation, that, had, been, triggered, by, the, strangling, of, radama, ii, reached, its, zenith, with, rainilaiarivony, s, consolidation, of, administrative, power, rasoherina, and, her, successors, remained, the, figureheads, of, traditional, authority, participated, in, political, councils, and, provided, official, approval, for, policies, the, prime, minister, issued, new, policies, and, laws, in, the, queen, s, name, however, the, day, to, day, governance, security, and, diplomatic, activities, of, the, kingdom, principally, originated, with, and, were, managed, by, rainilaiarivony, and, his, counselors, this, new, level, of, authority, enabled, the, prime, minister, to, amass, a, vast, personal, fortune, whether, through, inheritance, gifts, or, purchase, including, 57, houses, large, plantations, and, rice, paddies, numerous, cattle, and, thousands, of, slaves, the, most, prominent, of, rainilaiarivony, s, properties, was, the, andafiavaratra, palace, constructed, for, him, on, the, slope, just, below, the, royal, rova, compound, by, english, architect, william, pool, in, 1873, government, administration, and, bureaucracy, was, strengthened, under, rainilaiarivony, s, leadership, in, march, 1876, rainilaiarivony, established, eight, cabinet, ministries, to, manage, foreign, affairs, the, interior, education, war, justice, commerce, and, industry, finance, and, legislation, state, envoys, were, installed, throughout, the, island, s, provinces, to, manage, administrative, affairs, ensure, the, application, of, law, collect, taxes, and, provide, regular, reports, back, to, antananarivo, on, the, local, state, of, affairs, the, traditional, method, of, tax, collection, through, local, administrators, was, expanded, in, the, provinces, bringing, in, new, revenues, most, commonly, in, the, form, of, locally, produced, goods, such, as, woven, mats, fish, or, wood, rainilaiarivony, actively, encouraged, merina, settlement, in, the, coastal, provinces, but, coastal, peoples, were, not, invited, to, participate, in, political, administration, of, the, territories, they, inhabited, approximately, one, third, of, the, island, had, no, merina, presence, and, retained, de, facto, independence, from, the, authority, of, the, crown, including, parts, of, the, western, provinces, of, ambongo, and, menabe, and, areas, in, the, southern, bara, tanala, antandroy, and, mahafaly, lands, rainilaiarivony, s, first, royal, wife, queen, rasoherina, died, on, 1, april, 1868, and, was, succeeded, by, her, cousin, ranavalona, ii, crowned, on, 3, september, 1868, who, like, rasoherina, was, a, widow, of, radama, ii, ranavalona, ii, was, a, pupil, of, protestant, missionaries, and, had, converted, to, christianity, rainilaiarivony, recognized, the, growing, power, of, christianity, on, the, island, and, identified, the, need, to, bring, it, under, his, influence, in, order, to, avert, destabilizing, cultural, and, political, power, struggles, the, prime, minister, encouraged, the, new, queen, to, christianize, the, court, through, a, public, baptism, ceremony, at, andohalo, on, 21, february, 1869, the, day, of, their, marriage, in, this, ceremony, the, supernatural, royal, talismans, were, ordered, to, be, destroyed, and, replaced, by, the, bible, the, christianization, of, the, court, and, the, establishment, of, the, independent, royal, protestant, chapel, on, the, palace, grounds, prompted, the, wide, scale, conversion, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, malagasy, these, conversions, were, commonly, motivated, by, a, desire, to, express, political, allegiance, to, the, crown, and, as, such, were, largely, nominal, with, the, majority, of, converts, practicing, a, syncretic, blend, of, christian, and, traditional, religions, rainilaiarivony, s, biographers, conclude, that, the, prime, minister, s, own, conversion, was, also, largely, a, political, gesture, and, most, likely, did, not, denote, a, genuine, spiritual, shift, until, late, in, his, life, if, ever, some, local, officials, attempted, to, force, conversions, to, protestantism, by, mandating, church, attendance, and, persecuting, catholics, but, rainilaiarivony, quickly, responded, to, quell, these, overzealous, practices, the, prime, minister, s, criminalization, of, polygamy, and, alcohol, consumption, as, well, as, the, declaration, of, sunday, as, a, day, of, rest, were, likewise, inspired, by, the, growing, british, and, protestant, influences, in, the, country, the, christianization, of, the, court, came, at, a, steep, personal, price, with, the, outlawing, of, polygamy, rainilaiarivony, was, forced, to, repudiate, his, first, wife, the, prime, minister, was, deeply, saddened, by, this, necessity, and, by, the, consequent, souring, of, his, relationships, with, rasoanalina, and, their, children, after, the, divorce, the, prime, minister, recognized, that, the, modernization, of, madagascar, and, its, system, of, state, administration, could, strengthen, the, country, against, invasion, by, a, western, power, and, directed, his, energy, to, this, end, in, 1877, he, outlawed, the, enslavement, of, the, makoa, community, rainilaiarivony, expanded, the, public, education, system, declaring, school, attendance, mandatory, in, 1881, and, forming, a, cadre, of, school, inspectors, the, following, year, to, ensure, education, quality, the, island, s, first, pharmacy, was, established, by, lms, missionaries, in, 1862, and, the, first, hospital, was, inaugurated, in, antananarivo, three, years, later, followed, by, the, launching, in, 1875, of, a, state, medical, system, staffed, by, civil, servant, clinicians, rainilaiarivony, enacted, a, series, of, new, legal, codes, over, the, course, of, his, administration, that, sought, to, create, a, more, humane, social, order, the, number, of, capital, offenses, was, reduced, from, eighteen, to, thirteen, and, he, put, an, end, to, the, tradition, of, collective, family, punishment, for, the, crimes, of, one, individual, fines, were, fixed, for, specific, offenses, and, corporal, punishment, was, limited, to, being, locked, in, irons, the, structure, of, legal, administration, was, reorganized, so, that, matters, that, exceeded, the, authority, of, the, traditional, community, courts, at, the, level, of, the, fokonolona, village, collective, administered, by, local, magistrates, and, village, heads, would, be, referred, to, the, three, high, courts, established, in, the, capital, in, 1876, although, final, judicial, authority, remained, with, rainilaiarivony, the, code, of, 305, laws, established, that, same, year, would, form, the, basis, of, the, legal, system, applied, in, madagascar, for, the, remainder, of, the, 19th, century, and, throughout, much, of, the, colonial, period, to, strengthen, rule, of, law, the, prime, minister, introduced, a, rural, police, force, modernized, the, court, system, and, eliminated, certain, unjust, privileges, that, had, disproportionately, benefited, the, noble, class, beginning, in, 1872, rainilaiarivony, worked, to, modernize, the, army, with, the, assistance, of, a, british, military, instructor, who, was, hired, to, recruit, train, and, manage, its, soldiers, rainilaiarivony, purchased, new, local, and, imported, firearms, reintroduced, regular, exercises, and, reorganized, the, ranking, system, he, prohibited, the, purchasing, of, rank, promotions, or, exemptions, from, military, service, and, instituted, free, medical, care, for, soldiers, in, 1876, the, following, year, rainilaiarivony, introduced, the, mandatory, conscription, of, 5, 000, malagasy, from, each, of, the, island, s, six, provinces, to, serve, five, years, in, the, royal, army, swelling, its, ranks, to, over, 30, 000, soldiers, during, his, time, in, power, rainilaiarivony, proved, himself, a, competent, and, temperate, leader, administrator, and, diplomat, in, foreign, affairs, he, exercised, acumen, and, prudent, diplomacy, successfully, forestalling, french, colonial, designs, upon, madagascar, for, nearly, three, decades, rainilaiarivony, established, embassies, in, mauritius, france, and, britain, while, treaties, of, friendship, and, trade, were, concluded, with, britain, and, france, in, 1862, and, revised, in, 1865, and, 1868, respectively, upon, the, arrival, of, the, first, american, plenipotentiary, in, antananarivo, a, treaty, between, the, united, states, and, madagascar, was, agreed, in, 1867, a, british, contemporary, observed, that, his, diplomatic, communication, skills, were, particularly, evident, in, his, political, speeches, describing, rainilaiarivony, as, a, great, orator, among, a, nation, of, orators, the, early, years, of, rainilaiarivony, s, tenure, as, prime, minister, saw, a, reduction, in, french, influence, on, the, island, to, the, benefit, of, the, british, whose, alliance, he, strongly, preferred, contributing, factors, to, the, eclipse, of, french, presence, included, a, military, defeat, in, 1870, and, economic, constraints, that, forced, an, end, to, french, government, subsidy, of, catholic, missions, in, madagascar, in, 1871, he, permitted, foreigners, to, lease, malagasy, land, for, 99, years, but, forbade, its, sale, to, non, citizens, the, decision, not, to, undertake, the, construction, of, roads, connecting, coastal, towns, to, the, capital, was, adopted, as, a, deliberate, strategy, to, protect, antananarivo, from, potential, invasion, by, foreign, armies, despite, the, strong, presence, of, british, missionaries, military, advisers, and, diplomats, in, antananarivo, in, the, early, part, of, rainilaiarivony, s, administration, the, 1869, opening, of, the, suez, canal, led, the, british, to, shift, their, focus, to, combating, french, presence, in, egypt, at, the, expense, of, their, own, long, standing, interests, in, madagascar, when, jean, laborde, died, in, 1878, and, rainilaiarivony, refused, to, allow, his, heirs, to, inherit, malagasy, land, accorded, him, under, radama, ii, s, lambert, charter, france, had, a, pretext, for, invasion, rainilaiarivony, sent, a, diplomatic, mission, to, england, and, france, to, negotiate, release, of, their, claims, on, malagasy, lands, and, was, successful, in, brokering, a, new, agreement, with, the, british, talks, with, the, french, conducted, between, november, 1881, and, august, 1882, broke, down, without, reaching, consensus, on, the, status, of, french, land, claims, consequently, france, launched, the, first, franco, hova, war, in, 1883, and, occupied, the, coastal, port, towns, of, mahajanga, antsiranana, toamasina, and, vohemar, queen, ranavalona, ii, died, during, the, height, of, these, hostilities, in, july, 1883, rainilaiarivony, chose, her, 22, year, old, niece, princess, razafindrahety, to, replace, her, under, the, throne, name, ranavalona, iii, it, was, widely, rumored, that, rainilaiarivony, may, have, ordered, the, poisoning, of, razafindrahety, s, first, husband, in, order, to, free, the, princess, to, become, his, spouse, and, queen, thirty, three, years, younger, than, her, new, husband, ranavalona, iii, was, relegated, to, a, largely, ceremonial, role, during, her, reign, while, the, prime, minister, continued, to, manage, the, critical, affairs, of, state, in, december, 1885, rainilaiarivony, successfully, negotiated, the, cessation, of, hostilities, in, the, first, franco, hova, war, the, agreement, drafted, between, the, french, and, malagasy, governments, did, not, clearly, establish, a, french, protectorate, over, the, island, partly, because, recent, french, military, involvement, in, the, tonkin, campaign, had, begun, to, turn, popular, opinion, against, french, colonial, expansion, the, malagasy, crown, agreed, to, pay, ten, million, francs, to, france, to, settle, the, dispute, a, sum, that, was, partly, raised, through, the, unpopular, decision, to, increase, fanampoana, forced, labor, in, lieu, of, cash, taxes, to, mobilize, the, populace, in, panning, for, gold, in, the, kingdom, s, rivers, this, expense, coupled, with, rainilaiarivony, s, removal, of, 50, 000, in, silver, and, gold, coins, from, the, tomb, of, ranavalona, i, to, offset, the, cost, of, purchasing, arms, in, the, run, up, to, the, first, franco, hova, war, effectively, emptied, the, royal, treasury, reserves, capitalizing, on, madagascar, s, weakened, position, the, french, government, then, occupied, the, port, town, of, antsiranana, and, installed, french, resident, general, le, myre, de, vilers, in, antananarivo, citing, vague, sections, of, the, treaty, as, justification, the, resident, general, was, empowered, by, the, french, government, to, control, international, trade, and, foreign, affairs, on, the, island, although, the, monarchy, s, authority, over, internal, administration, was, left, unchallenged, refusing, to, acknowledge, the, validity, of, the, french, interpretation, of, the, treaty, rainilaiarivony, continued, managing, trade, and, international, relations, and, unsuccessfully, solicited, assistance, from, the, united, states, in, maintaining, the, island, s, sovereignty, in, 1894, the, french, government, pressed, rainilaiarivony, to, unconditionally, accept, the, status, of, madagascar, as, a, french, protectorate, in, response, rainilaiarivony, broke, off, all, diplomatic, relations, with, france, in, november, 1894, the, cessation, of, diplomatic, relations, between, france, and, madagascar, prompted, immediate, french, military, action, in, a, campaign, that, became, known, as, the, second, franco, hova, war, the, expedition, ended, eleven, months, later, in, september, 1895, when, a, french, military, column, reached, antananarivo, and, bombarded, the, royal, palace, with, heavy, artillery, blasting, a, hole, through, the, roof, of, the, queen, s, quarters, and, inflicting, heavy, casualties, among, the, numerous, courtiers, gathered, in, the, palace, courtyard, rainilaiarivony, sent, an, interpreter, to, carry, a, white, flag, to, the, french, commander, and, entreat, his, clemency, forty, five, minutes, later, he, was, joined, by, radilifera, the, prime, minister, s, son, to, request, the, conditions, of, surrender, these, were, immediately, accepted, the, following, day, queen, ranavalona, signed, a, treaty, accepting, the, french, protectorate, over, madagascar, she, and, her, court, were, permitted, to, remain, at, the, palace, and,

of, great, spontaneity, sincere, friendliness, and, openness, of, heart, but, also, prone, to, mood, swings, touchiness, and, a, tendency, to, be, demanding, especially, in, regard, to, his, particular, tastes, in, clothing, his, intelligence, tact, and, leadership, qualities, won, him, the, admiration, of, many, who, knew, him, including, le, myre, des, vilers, who, referred, to, him,
