personal, god, saguna, brahman, which, conflicts, with, the, m, m, s, school, in, his, varttika, kum, rila, bha, a, goes, to, great, lengths, to, argue, against, the, theory, of, a, creator, god, and, held, that, the, actions, enjoined, in, the, veda, had, definite, results, without, an, external, interference, of, deity, kum, rila, is, also, credited, with, the, logical, formulation, of, the, mimamsic, belief, that, the, vedas, are, unauthored, apauru, ey, in, particular, he, is, known, for, his, defense, of, vedic, ritualism, against, medieval, buddhist, idealism, his, work, strongly, influenced, other, schools, of, indian, philosophy, with, the, exception, that, while, mimamsa, considers, the, upanishads, to, be, subservient, to, the, vedas, the, vedanta, school, does, not, think, so, the, birthplace, of, kum, rila, bhatta, is, uncertain, according, to, the, 16th, century, buddhist, scholar, taranatha, kum, rila, was, a, native, of, south, india, however, anandagiri, s, shankara, vijaya, states, that, kumarila, came, from, the, north, udagde, t, and, debated, the, buddhists, and, the, jains, in, the, south, another, theory, is, that, he, came, from, eastern, india, specifically, kamarupa, present, day, assam, sesa, s, sarvasiddhanta, rahasya, uses, the, eastern, title, bhattacharya, for, him, his, writings, indicate, that, he, was, familiar, with, the, production, of, silk, which, was, common, in, present, day, assam, yet, another, theory, is, that, he, comes, from, mithila, which, has, similar, culture, to, assam, and, produced, another, scholar, on, the, subject, mandana, misra, according, to, legend, in, mithila, the, kumarila, bhatta, dih, at, bhatsimar, or, bhatpura, in, the, mithila, region, is, believed, to, be, the, birthplace, of, kumarila, bhatta, kum, rila, bha, a, and, his, followers, in, the, m, m, s, tradition, known, as, bh, as, argued, for, a, strongly, compositional, view, of, semantics, called, abhihit, nvaya, or, designation, of, what, has, been, denoted, in, this, view, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, was, understood, only, after, understanding, first, the, meanings, of, individual, words, word, referents, were, independent, complete, objects, a, view, that, is, close, to, the, fodorian, view, of, language, according, to, philosopher, daniel, arnold, he, also, used, several, tamil, words, in, his, works, including, one, of, the, earliest, mention, of, the, name, dravida, in, north, indian, sources, found, in, his, tantrav, rttika, the, above, mentioned, view, of, sentence, meaning, was, debated, over, some, seven, or, eight, centuries, by, the, followers, of, the, prabh, kara, school, within, m, m, s, who, argued, that, words, do, not, directly, designate, meaning, rather, word, meanings, are, understood, as, already, connected, with, other, words, anvit, bhidh, na, anvita, connected, abhidh, na, denotation, this, view, was, influenced, by, the, holistic, arguments, of, bhart, hari, s, spho, a, theory, essentially, the, pr, bh, karas, argued, that, sentence, meanings, are, grasped, directly, from, perceptual, and, contextual, cues, skipping, the, stage, of, grasping, singly, the, individual, word, meanings, similar, to, the, modern, view, of, linguistic, underspecification, which, relates, to, the, dynamic, turn, in, semantics, that, also, opposes, purely, compositional, approaches, to, sentence, meaning, in, his, text, slokavarttika, kum, rila, bhatta, argues, that, cognitions, are, intrinsically, valid, svatah, pramanya, it, should, be, understood, that, all, pramanas, have, the, property, of, being, pramanas, intrinsically, for, a, capacity, not, already, existing, by, itself, svatah, cannot, be, produced, by, anything, else, kum, rila, argues, against, the, need, for, second, order, justification, before, accepting, cognitions, as, valid, kum, rila, bha, a, is, known, for, his, defense, of, vedic, ritualism, against, medieval, buddhist, idealism, with, the, aim, to, prove, the, superiority, of, vedic, scripture, kum, rila, bha, a, presented, several, novel, arguments, 1, buddhist, or, jain, scripture, could, not, be, correct, because, it, had, several, grammatical, lapses, he, specifically, takes, the, buddhist, verse, ime, samkhada, dhamma, sambhavanti, sakarana, akarana, vinassanti, these, phenomena, arise, when, the, cause, is, present, and, perish, when, the, cause, is, absent, thus, he, presents, his, argument, the, scriptures, of, buddhists, and, jains, are, composed, in, overwhelmingly, incorrect, asadhu, language, words, of, the, magadha, or, dakshinatya, languages, or, even, their, dialects, tadopabhramsa, therefore, false, compositions, asannibandhana, they, cannot, possibly, be, true, knowledge, shastra, by, contrast, the, very, form, itself, the, well, assembled, language, of, the, veda, proves, its, authority, to, be, independent, and, absolute, 2, every, extant, school, held, some, scripture, to, be, correct, to, show, that, the, veda, was, the, only, correct, scripture, kum, rila, said, that, the, absence, of, an, author, would, safeguard, the, veda, against, all, reproach, apaurusheya, there, was, no, way, to, prove, any, of, the, contents, of, buddhist, scriptures, directly, as, wrong, in, spirit, unless, one, challenges, the, legitimacy, and, eternal, nature, of, the, scripture, itself, it, is, well, known, that, the, pali, canon, was, composed, after, the, buddha, s, parinirvana, further, even, if, they, were, the, buddha, s, words, they, were, not, eternal, or, unauthored, like, the, vedas, 3, the, sautrantika, buddhist, school, believed, that, the, universe, was, momentary, kshanika, kum, rila, said, that, this, was, absurd, given, that, the, universe, does, not, disappear, every, moment, no, matter, how, small, one, would, define, the, duration, of, a, moment, one, could, divide, the, moment, into, infinitely, further, parts, kum, rila, argues, if, the, universe, does, not, exist, between, moments, then, in, which, of, these, moments, does, it, exist, because, a, moment, could, be, infinitesimally, small, bha, a, argued, that, the, buddhist, was, claiming, that, the, universe, was, non, existent, 4, the, determination, of, perception, pratyaksha, pariccheda, some, scholars, believe, that, kum, rila, s, understanding, of, buddhist, philosophy, was, far, greater, than, that, of, any, other, non, buddhist, philosopher, of, his, time, however, see, taber, 2010, for, an, alternate, view, according, to, buton, rinchen, drub, kum, rila, spoke, abusively, towards, his, nephew, dharmak, rti, as, he, was, taking, his, brahminical, garments, this, drove, dharmak, rti, away, and, resolving, to, vanquish, all, non, buddhist, heretics, he, took, the, robes, of, the, buddhist, order, instead, according, to, legend, kum, rila, went, to, study, buddhism, at, nalanda, the, largest, 4th, century, university, in, the, world, with, the, aim, of, refuting, buddhist, doctrine, in, favour, of, vedic, religion, he, was, expelled, from, the, university, when, he, protested, against, his, teacher, dharmakirti, ridiculing, the, vedic, rituals, legend, has, it, that, even, though, he, was, thrown, off, of, the, university, s, tower, he, survived, with, an, eye, injury, by, claiming, if, the, vedas, are, the, ultimate, then, i, will, be, spared, from, death, modern, mimamsa, scholars, and, followers, of, vedanta, believe, that, this, was, because, he, imposed, a, condition, on, the, infallibility, of, the, vedas, thus, encouraging, the, hindu, belief, that, one, should, not, even, doubt, the, infallibility, of, the, vedas, the, madhaviya, sankara, digvijayam, a, 14th, century, hagiographic, work, on, the, life, of, sankara, claims, that, sankara, challenged, bha, a, to, a, debate, on, his, deathbed, kum, rila, bha, a, could, not, debate, sankara, as, he, was, punishing, himself, to, have, disrespected, his, buddhist, teacher, by, defeating, him, in, a, debate, using, the, vedas, by, self, immolation, at, the, banks, of, ganga, at, prayagraj, and, instead, directed, him, to, argue, with, his, student, mandana, misra, in, mahi, mati, he, said, you, will, find, a, home, at, whose, gates, there, are, a, number, of, caged, parrots, discussing, abstract, topics, like, do, the, vedas, have, self, validity, or, do, they, depend, on, some, external, authority, for, their, validity, are, karmas, capable, of, yielding, their, fruits, directly, or, do, they, require, the, intervention, of, god, to, do, so, is, the, world, eternal, or, is, it, a, mere, appearance, where, you, find, the, caged, parrots, discussing, such, abstruse, philosophical, problems, you, will, know, that, you, have, reached, ma, ana, s, place, kumarila, s, importance, in, the, history, of, indian, philosophy, comes, to, light, in, view, of, how, his, work, has, been, extensively, quoted
