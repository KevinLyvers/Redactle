alfred, charles, kinsey, k, n, z, i, june, 23, 1894, august, 25, 1956, was, an, american, sexologist, biologist, and, professor, of, entomology, and, zoology, who, in, 1947, founded, the, institute, for, sex, research, at, indiana, university, now, known, as, the, kinsey, institute, for, research, in, sex, gender, and, reproduction, he, is, best, known, for, writing, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, male, 1948, and, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, 1953, also, known, as, the, kinsey, reports, as, well, as, for, the, kinsey, scale, kinsey, s, research, on, human, sexuality, foundational, to, the, field, of, sexology, provoked, controversy, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, has, continued, to, provoke, controversy, decades, after, his, death, his, work, has, influenced, social, and, cultural, values, in, the, united, states, as, well, as, internationally, alfred, kinsey, was, born, on, june, 23, 1894, in, hoboken, new, jersey, the, son, of, sarah, ann, n, e, charles, and, alfred, seguine, kinsey, he, was, the, eldest, of, three, children, his, mother, received, little, formal, education, his, father, was, a, professor, at, stevens, institute, of, technology, kinsey, s, parents, were, devout, christians, his, father, was, known, as, one, of, the, most, devout, members, of, the, local, methodist, church, most, of, kinsey, s, social, interactions, were, with, other, members, of, the, church, often, as, a, silent, observer, while, his, parents, discussed, religion, kinsey, s, father, imposed, strict, rules, on, the, household, including, mandating, sunday, as, a, day, of, prayer, and, little, else, kinsey, s, parents, were, poor, for, most, of, his, childhood, often, unable, to, afford, proper, medical, care, this, may, have, led, to, a, young, kinsey, receiving, inadequate, treatment, for, a, variety, of, diseases, including, rickets, rheumatic, fever, and, typhoid, fever, his, health, records, indicate, that, kinsey, received, suboptimal, exposure, to, sunlight, often, the, cause, of, rickets, before, milk, and, other, foods, were, fortified, with, vitamin, d, and, lived, in, unsanitary, conditions, for, at, least, part, of, his, childhood, rickets, led, to, a, curvature, of, the, spine, which, resulted, in, a, slight, stoop, that, prevented, kinsey, from, being, drafted, in, 1917, for, world, war, i, at, age, 10, kinsey, moved, with, his, family, to, south, orange, new, jersey, also, at, a, young, age, he, showed, great, interest, in, nature, and, camping, he, worked, and, camped, with, the, local, ymca, throughout, his, early, years, and, enjoyed, these, activities, to, such, an, extent, that, he, intended, to, work, for, the, ymca, after, completing, his, education, kinsey, s, senior, undergraduate, thesis, for, psychology, a, dissertation, on, the, group, dynamics, of, young, boys, echoed, this, interest, he, joined, the, boy, scouts, when, a, troop, was, formed, in, his, community, his, parents, strongly, supported, this, and, joined, as, well, because, the, boy, scouts, was, an, organization, that, was, based, on, the, principles, of, christianity, kinsey, worked, his, way, up, through, the, scouting, ranks, to, earn, eagle, scout, in, 1913, making, him, one, of, the, earliest, eagle, scouts, despite, earlier, disease, having, weakened, his, heart, kinsey, followed, an, intense, sequence, of, difficult, hikes, and, camping, expeditions, throughout, his, early, life, in, high, school, kinsey, was, a, quiet, but, hard, working, student, while, attending, columbia, high, school, he, devoted, his, energy, to, academic, work, and, playing, the, piano, at, one, time, kinsey, had, hoped, to, become, a, concert, pianist, but, decided, to, concentrate, on, his, scientific, pursuits, instead, kinsey, s, ability, to, spend, immense, amounts, of, time, deeply, focused, on, study, was, a, trait, that, would, serve, him, well, in, college, and, during, his, professional, career, he, seems, not, to, have, formed, strong, social, relationships, during, high, school, but, earned, respect, for, his, academic, ability, while, there, kinsey, became, interested, in, biology, botany, and, zoology, kinsey, was, later, to, claim, that, his, high, school, biology, teacher, natalie, roeth, was, the, most, important, influence, on, his, decision, to, become, a, scientist, kinsey, approached, his, father, with, plans, to, study, botany, at, college, his, father, demanded, that, he, study, engineering, at, stevens, institute, of, technology, instead, at, stevens, he, primarily, took, courses, related, to, english, and, engineering, but, was, unable, to, satisfy, his, interest, in, biology, kinsey, was, not, successful, there, and, decided, engineering, was, not, a, field, at, which, he, could, excel, at, the, end, of, two, years, at, stevens, kinsey, gathered, the, courage, to, confront, his, father, about, his, interest, in, biology, and, his, intent, to, continue, studying, at, bowdoin, college, in, brunswick, maine, where, he, majored, in, biology, in, the, fall, of, 1914, kinsey, entered, bowdoin, college, where, he, studied, entomology, under, manton, copeland, and, was, admitted, to, the, zeta, psi, fraternity, in, whose, house, he, lived, for, much, of, his, time, at, college, in, 1916, kinsey, was, elected, to, the, phi, beta, kappa, society, and, graduated, magna, cum, laude, with, degrees, in, biology, and, psychology, alfred, seguine, kinsey, did, not, attend, his, son, s, graduation, ceremony, at, bowdoin, possibly, as, another, sign, of, disapproval, of, his, son, s, choice, of, career, and, studies, kinsey, continued, his, graduate, studies, at, harvard, university, s, bussey, institute, which, had, one, of, the, most, highly, regarded, biology, programs, in, the, united, states, it, was, there, that, kinsey, studied, applied, biology, under, william, morton, wheeler, a, scientist, who, made, outstanding, contributions, to, entomology, under, wheeler, kinsey, worked, almost, completely, autonomously, which, suited, both, men, quite, well, kinsey, wrote, his, doctoral, thesis, on, gall, wasps, zealously, collecting, samples, of, the, species, he, traveled, widely, and, took, 26, detailed, measurements, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, gall, wasps, his, methodology, was, itself, an, important, contribution, to, entomology, as, a, science, in, 1919, kinsey, was, awarded, a, scd, degree, by, harvard, university, and, he, accepted, an, academic, post, in, biology, at, indiana, university, in, 1920, he, published, several, papers, under, the, auspices, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, new, york, city, introducing, the, gall, wasp, to, the, scientific, community, and, describing, its, phylogeny, of, the, more, than, 18, million, insects, in, the, museum, s, collection, some, 5, million, are, gall, wasps, collected, by, kinsey, kinsey, wrote, a, widely, used, high, school, textbook, an, introduction, to, biology, which, was, published, in, october, 1926, the, book, endorsed, evolution, and, unified, at, the, introductory, level, the, previously, separate, fields, of, zoology, and, botany, an, introduction, to, biology, was, unlike, any, other, textbook, on, the, market, kinsey, s, textbook, was, noteworthy, for, the, strong, position, it, took, on, evolution, in, his, textbook, kinsey, laid, out, the, basic, facts, of, evolution, in, a, manner, of, fact, matter, as, though, he, were, discussing, the, life, cycle, of, the, fruit, fly, the, chapter, called, further, evidence, of, change, was, especially, blunt, kinsey, defined, evolution, as, the, scientific, word, for, change, and, while, he, acknowledged, that, there, are, some, people, who, think, they, don, t, believe, in, evolution, he, tried, to, show, his, students, the, folly, of, such, reasoning, to, find, proof, of, evolution, students, had, only, to, look, at, things, they, used, daily, kinsey, ridiculed, the, man, who, denounced, evolution, but, owned, a, new, breed, of, dog, or, smoked, a, cigar, made, from, a, recently, improved, variety, of, tobacco, saying, when, he, says, he, doesn, t, believe, in, evolution, i, wonder, what, he, means, kinsey, co, authored, edible, wild, plants, of, eastern, north, america, published, in, 1943, with, merritt, lyndon, fernald, the, original, draft, of, the, book, was, written, in, 1919, 1920, while, kinsey, was, still, a, doctoral, student, at, the, bussey, institute, and, fernald, was, working, at, the, arnold, arboretum, kinsey, is, widely, regarded, as, the, first, major, figure, in, american, sexology, his, research, helped, pave, the, way, for, a, deeper, exploration, into, sexuality, among, sexologists, and, the, general, public, as, well, as, liberating, female, sexuality, for, example, kinsey, s, work, disputed, the, notions, that, women, generally, are, not, sexual, and, that, female, orgasms, experienced, vaginally, are, superior, to, clitoral, orgasms, he, initially, became, interested, in, different, forms, of, sexual, practices, in, 1933, after, discussing, the, topic, extensively, with, a, colleague, robert, kroc, kinsey, had, been, studying, the, variations, in, mating, practices, among, gall, wasps, during, this, time, he, developed, a, scale, measuring, sexual, orientation, now, known, as, the, kinsey, scale, which, ranges, from, 0, to, 6, where, 0, is, exclusively, heterosexual, and, 6, is, exclusively, homosexual, a, rating, of, x, for, no, socio, sexual, contacts, or, reactions, was, later, added, in, 1935, kinsey, delivered, a, lecture, to, a, faculty, discussion, group, at, indiana, university, his, first, public, discussion, of, the, topic, wherein, he, attacked, the, widespread, ignorance, of, sexual, structure, and, physiology, and, promoted, his, view, that, delayed, marriage, that, is, delayed, sexual, experience, was, psychologically, harmful, kinsey, obtained, research, funding, from, the, rockefeller, foundation, which, enabled, him, to, further, study, human, sexual, behavior, he, published, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, male, in, 1948, followed, in, 1953, by, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, both, of, which, reached, the, top, of, the, bestseller, lists, and, turned, kinsey, into, a, celebrity, these, publications, later, became, known, as, the, kinsey, reports, articles, about, him, appeared, in, magazines, such, as, time, life, look, and, mccall, s, the, kinsey, reports, which, led, to, a, storm, of, controversy, are, regarded, by, many, as, a, precursor, to, the, sexual, revolution, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, kinsey, s, research, went, beyond, theory, and, interview, to, include, observation, of, and, participation, in, sexual, activity, sometimes, involving, co, workers, kinsey, justified, this, sexual, experimentation, as, being, necessary, to, gain, the, confidence, of, his, research, subjects, he, encouraged, his, staff, to, do, likewise, and, to, engage, in, a, wide, range, of, sexual, activity, to, the, extent, that, they, felt, comfortable, he, argued, that, this, would, help, his, interviewers, understand, the, participants, responses, kinsey, filmed, sexual, acts, which, included, co, workers, in, the, attic, of, his, home, as, part, of, his, research, biographer, jonathan, gathorne, hardy, explains, that, this, was, done, to, ensure, the, films, secrecy, which, would, have, caused, a, scandal, had, it, become, public, knowledge, james, h, jones, author, of, alfred, c, kinsey, a, public, private, life, and, british, psychiatrist, anthony, malcolm, daniels, aka, theodore, dalrymple, among, others, have, speculated, that, kinsey, was, driven, by, his, own, sexual, needs, some, of, the, data, published, in, the, two, kinsey, reports, books, is, controversial, in, the, scientific, and, psychiatric, communities, owing, to, kinsey, s, decision, to, interview, volunteers, who, may, not, have, been, representative, of, the, general, population, university, of, chicago, sociology, professor, edward, laumann, also, argued, that, kinsey, s, work, was, focused, on, the, biology, of, sex, and, lacked, psychological, and, clinical, information, and, analysis, kinsey, collected, sexual, material, from, around, the, world, which, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, u, s, customs, service, when, they, seized, some, pornographic, films, in, 1956, he, died, before, this, matter, was, resolved, legally, kinsey, wrote, about, pre, adolescent, orgasms, using, data, in, tables, 30, to, 34, of, the, male, volume, which, report, observations, of, orgasms, in, over, 300, children, aged, from, two, months, up, to, fifteen, years, this, information, was, said, to, have, come, from, adults, childhood, memories, or, from, parent, or, teacher, observation, kinsey, said, he, also, interviewed, nine, men, who, had, sexual, experiences, with, children, and, who, told, him, about, the, children, s, responses, and, reactions, little, attention, was, paid, to, this, part, of, kinsey, s, research, at, the, time, but, where, kinsey, had, gained, this, information, began, to, be, questioned, nearly, 40, years, later, it, was, later, revealed, that, kinsey, used, data, from, a, single, pedophile, and, presented, it, as, being, from, various, sources, kinsey, had, seen, the, need, for, participant, confidentiality, and, anonymity, as, necessary, to, gain, honest, answers, on, such, taboo, subjects, years, later, the, kinsey, institute, said, that, the, data, on, children, in, tables, 31, 34, came, from, one, man, s, journal, started, in, 1917, and, that, the, events, concerned, predated, the, kinsey, reports, these, allegations, have, been, revived, by, a, political, fight, inside, the, indiana, state, senate, but, the, opposition, complained, that, these, are, warmed, over, internet, memes, that, keep, coming, back, indystar, remarked, they, cited, long, held, but, largely, debunked, allegations, about, the, work, of, alfred, kinsey, jones, wrote, that, kinsey, s, sexual, activity, influenced, his, work, that, he, over, represented, prisoners, and, prostitutes, classified, some, single, people, as, married, and, that, he, included, a, disproportionate, number, of, homosexual, men, which, may, have, distorted, his, studies, while, he, has, been, criticized, for, omitting, african, americans, from, his, research, his, report, on, the, human, male, includes, numerous, references, to, african, american, participants, historian, vern, bullough, writes, that, the, data, was, later, reinterpreted, excluding, prisoners, and, data, derived, from, an, exclusively, gay, sample, and, the, results, indicate, that, it, does, not, appear, to, have, skewed, the, data, kinsey, may, have, over, represented, homosexuals, but, bullough, considers, that, this, may, have, been, because, homosexual, behavior, was, stigmatized, and, needed, to, be, better, understood, paul, gebhard, who, was, kinsey, s, colleague, from, 1946, to, 1956, and, who, also, succeeded, kinsey, as, director, of, the, kinsey, institute, following, his, death, attempted, to, justify, kinsey, s, work, in, the, 1970s, by, removing, some, of, the, suspect, data, where, kinsey, allegedly, showed, a, bias, towards, homosexuality, after, gebhard, recalculated, the, findings, in, kinsey, s, work, he, found, only, slight, differences, between, the, original, and, updated, figures, bailey, et, al, in, their, 2016, review, of, the, sexual, orientation, literature, stated, that, kinsey, s, survey, likely, overestimated, the, frequencies, of, nonheterosexual, attractions, and, expressions, because, his, statistics, show, a, higher, percentage, of, the, american, population, as, homosexual, or, bisexual, than, more, modern, studies, do, however, as, kinsey, biographer, jonathan, gathorne, hardy, points, out, kinsey, s, interview, style, was, quite, different, from, the, methodologies, of, modern, studies, so, it, would, make, sense, that, he, got, somewhat, different, answers, kinsey, focused, on, in, depth, interviews, with, subjects, carried, out, by, himself, or, highly, trained, members, of, his, team, and, emphasized, creating, rapport, with, the, interviewee, and, making, them, feel, comfortable, and, secure, modern, interviewers, tend, to, be, less, thoroughly, trained, and, emphasize, scientific, detachment, which, may, make, respondents, less, likely, to, share, sensitive, personal, details, kinsey, was, raised, as, a, methodist, and, for, a, time, converted, to, a, much, less, fundamentalist, congregationalism, during, his, studies, at, harvard, he, apparently, became, agnostic, or, atheist, replacing, religious, fervor, with, fervor, for, science, he, married, clara, mcmillen, in, 1921, their, marriage, ceremony, like, his, college, graduation, was, avoided, by, alfred, sr, the, couple, had, four, children, their, first, son, donald, born, in, 1922, died, from, the, acute, complications, of, juvenile, diabetes, in, 1927, just, before, his, fifth, birthday, their, first, daughter, anne, was, born, in, 1924, followed, by, joan, in, 1925, and, then, by, their, second, son, bruce, in, 1928, kinsey, was, bisexual, and, one, biographer, believes, that, as, a, young, man, he, would, punish, himself, for, having, homoerotic, feelings, he, and, his, wife, agreed, that, both, could, have, sex, with, other, people, as, well, as, with, each, other, kinsey, had, sex, with, other, men, including, his, student, clyde, martin, kinsey, designed, his, own, house, which, was, built, in, the, vinegar, hill, neighborhood, of, bloomington, indiana, at, 1320, first, street, there, he, practiced, his, deep, interest, in, gardening, kinsey, died, on, august, 25, 1956, at, the, age, of, 62, the, cause, of, his, death, was, reported, to, be, a, heart, ailment, and, pneumonia, the, new, york, times, ran, the, following, editorial, on, august, 27, 1956, the, untimely, death, of, dr, alfred, c, kinsey, takes, from, the, american, scene, an, important, and, valuable, as, well, as, controversial, figure, whatever, may, have, been, the, reaction, to, his, findings, and, to, the, unscrupulous, use, of, some, of, them, the, fact, remains, that, he, was, first, last, and, always, a, scientist, in, the, long, run, it, is, probable, that, the, values, of, his, contribution, to, contemporary, thought, will, lie, much, less, in, what, he, found, out, than, in, the, method, he, used, and, his, way, of, applying, it, any, sort, of, scientific, approach, to, the, problems, of, sex, is, difficult, because, the, field, is, so, deeply, overlaid, with, such, things, as, moral, precept, taboo, individual, and, group, training, and, long, established, behavior, patterns, some, of, these, may, be, good, in, themselves, but, they, are, no, help, to, the, scientific, and, empirical, method, of, getting, at, the, truth, dr, kinsey, cut, through, this, overlay, with, detachment, and, precision, his, work, was, conscientious, and, comprehensive, naturally, it, will, receive, a, serious, setback, with, his, death, let, us, earnestly, hope, that, the, scientific, spirit, that, inspired, it, will, not, be, similarly, impaired,
