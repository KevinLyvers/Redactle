two, options, after, graduating, from, law, school, he, could, either, accept, an, instructorship, position, in, the, school, he, had, just, graduated, from, or, he, could, become, the, state, attorney, vargas, chose, the, latter, a, position, that, was, secured, by, his, father, and, he, was, named, the, rio, grande, do, sul, state, attorney, general, by, his, party, while, it, was, very, apparent, that, vargas, received, the, position, due, to, his, political, connections, he, remained, as, state, attorney, until, 1908, vargas, would, gain, valuable, experience, as, state, attorney, and, after, building, himself, a, reputation, for, loyalty, and, brightness, was, elected, to, the, legislative, assembly, of, rio, grande, do, sul, in, 1909, though, he, was, only, in, his, twenties, he, still, managed, to, make, himself, known, for, the, ability, to, temporize, and, became, well, liked, however, the, legislative, assembly, only, convened, for, two, months, in, a, year, and, pay, was, allotted, meaning, that, vargas, needed, to, find, other, income, sources, this, was, partially, because, of, the, downgraded, importance, of, state, legislators, in, rio, grande, do, sul, in, sharp, contrast, to, other, states, believing, s, o, borja, could, not, support, more, than, one, advocate, s, office, vargas, began, his, legal, career, as, a, promotor, or, a, public, prosecutor, in, porto, alegre, vargas, s, first, case, dealt, with, rape, one, which, he, settled, privately, by, convincing, both, parties, to, marry, vargas, s, vocation, as, a, promoter, did, not, last, long, for, he, married, fifteen, year, old, darci, lima, sarmanho, a, woman, thirteen, years, younger, than, himself, in, march, 1911, they, would, remain, together, for, forty, three, years, until, vargas,

m, levine, darci, stayed, in, the, background, for, most, of, vargas, s, life, and, looked, after, the, family, s, households, she, also, devoted, herself, to, public, charity, causes, later, in, their, lives, when, vargas, would, become, president, they, had, five, children, together, lutero, jandira, alzira, manuel, also, known, as, maneco, and, get, lio, also, known, as, getulinho, alzira,

mistress, in, 1937, and, become, devoted, to, her, this, was, later, confirmed, by, his, diaries, published, fifty, years, after, his, death, in, 2004, it, is, believed, the, mistress, was, aim, e, de, soto, maior, later, aim, e, de, heeren, recognized, by, the, international, fashion, press, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, glamorous, and, beautiful, women, heeren, neither, confirmed, nor, denied, the, rumor, manuel, gave, vargas, some, land, near, his, own, and, money, to, set, up, a, home, and, legal, practice, in, s, o, borja, the, combination, of, a, political, and, legal, profession, was, common, in, latin, america, vargas, was, now, a, conciliator, and, advisor, taking, on, many, cases, dealing, with, a, social, factor, an, experience, that, can, be, considered, a, component, of, his, later, social, reform, between, 1913, and, 1917, vargas, s, political, career, ceased, however, while, the, second, term, of, president, borges, de, medeiros, was, underway, vargas, fell, out, with, the, state, president, at, the, end, of, 1912, commenting, on, his, resignation, speech, to, the, assembly, historian, richard, bourne, states, get, lio, s, departure, was, marked, with, finesse, he, made, just, enough, noise, to, indicate, to, the, gaucho, boss, that, he, was, not, to, be, treated, lightly, and, not, such, a, dramatic, ruction, as, to, make, a, later, composition, impossible, medeiros, still, needed, the, powerful, vargases, support, however, near, the, end, of, 1916, vargas, refused, an, offer, from, medeiros, to, become, the, state, s, police, chief, opting, instead, to, successfully, run, for, reelection, as, a, state, deputy, and, would, remain, for, two, terms, throughout, his, renewed, tenure, he, was, satirically, described, as, the, mathematician, of, the, party, and, named, party, or, majority, leader, while, tasked, with, the, crucial, responsibility, of, ensuring, the, reelection, of, medeiros, vargas, was, also, chairman, of, an, assembly, commission, dedicated, to, verifying, election, results, for, the, state, presidency, or, as, his, opposition, put, it, partaking, in, electoral, fraud, in, the, latter, part, of, his, term, vargas, was, in, charge, of, leading, and, reporting, the, budget, during, the, 1923, civil, war, in, rio, grande, do, sul, vargas, was, called, upon, to, lead, a, military, unit, with, republicans, he, would, organize, the, seventh, provisional, division, and, when, republicans, oswaldo, aranha, and, jos, antonio, flores, da, cunha, were, under, siege, by, liberationists, led, two, hundred, fifty, provis, rios, as, lieutenant, colonel, marching, one, hundred, miles, at, night, to, uruguaiana, to, defend, the, ideas, of, his, party, halfway, there, at, itaqui, he, found, the, railway, cut, and, an, absence, of, mounts, for, his, horsemen, according, to, aranha, s, brother, adalberto, vargas, was, persistent, decisive, and, speedy, throughout, the, crisis, he, ordered, his, forces, out, of, the, town, and, the, embarkation, of, his, troops, on, requisitioned, river, barges, vargas, also, ignored, low, water, warnings, to, save, the, detrimental, situation, the, republicans, had, gotten, themselves, into, he, said, i, will, send, them, all, to, arrive, there, in, time, only, the, impossible, will, deter, me, from, coming, to, the, help, of, my, comrades, before, he, could, command, any, real, action, president, medeiros, messaged, vargas, to, hand, over, the, military, as, he, had, been, named, federal, deputy, a, vacant, seat, he, ran, for, in, 1922, and, deputies, could, only, command, troops, with, the, permission, of, the, national, congress, vargas, turned, his, command, over, to, his, cousin, deoclecio, dorneles, motta, immediately, departed, for, rio, de, janeiro, and, now, held, a, far, more, important, task, restoring, the, power, of, rio, grande, do, sul, in, federal, politics, in, may, 1923, vargas, became, a, national, deputy, becoming, medeiros, s, man, of, confidence, during, a, troubling, period, his, objective, was, to, diminish, federal, intervention, in, the, state, civil, war, and, gave, a, speech, stating, the, state, government, had, it, under, control, in, reality, there, was, doubt, this, statement, was, true, and, medeiros, had, had, to, raise, private, loans, in, uruguay, to, pay, for, war, expenses, vargas, also, had, to, lead, his, bloc, of, ga, cho, deputies, demoralized, after, an, editorial, appeared, in, porto, alegre, calling, for, the, acceptance, of, the, incoming, artur, bernardes, administration, in, 1924, vargas, became, the, official, leader, of, the, rio, grande, do, sul, congressional, delegation, the, same, year, he, was, forced, to, take, his, daughter, alzira, out, of, school, in, november, after, a, warship, opened, fire, on, rio, de, janeiro, as, part, of, the, tenente, rebellions, according, to, levine, vargas, s, most, noteworthy, achievement, as, a, congressman, came, in, 1925, when, as, a, member, of, a, commission, studying, constitutional, reform, he, advocated, greater, government, authority, with, the, knowledge, that, a, paulista, would, succeed, bernardes, vargas, cultivated, the, s, o, paulo, delegation, during, bernardes, presidency, when, washington, lu, s, was, elected, president, in, 1926, he, chose, vargas, to, become, his, minister, of, finance, this, was, despite, the, fact, vargas, had, virtually, no, fiscal, experience, even, going, as, far, as, to, deny, joining, a, finance, committee, when, he, was, in, congress, the, appointment, was, based, on, gratitude, toward, medeiros, for, helping, him, become, president, and, a, political, deal, as, part, of, the, many, cabinet, positions, divided, amongst, important, states, though, the, economy, was, prosperous, from, 1926, to, 1928, it, was, entirely, based, upon, coffee, within, a, month, vargas, had, submitted, a, money, reform, bill, to, the, national, congress, similar, to, the, french, poincar, with, the, objective, of, stabilizing, the, value, of, the, brazilian, currency, it, saw, initial, success, before, collapsing, in, the, wake, of, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, vargas, introduced, a, tax, on, consumption, with, the, purpose, of, undermining, the, country, s, dependency, on, customs, revenue, he, would, also, hold, audiences, where, up, to, a, hundred, people, could, submit, their, petitions, requests, and, complaints, ranging, from, ordinary, citizens, to, congressional, deputies, although, vargas, only, served, two, years, as, finance, secretary, before, returning, to, rio, grande, do, sul, to, become, the, president, governor, in, 1928, he, gained, valuable, recognition, and, experience, on, a, national, level, in, 1928, medeiros, was, to, complete, his, lengthy, tenure, and, depart, from, the, presidency, of, rio, grande, do, sul, vargas, meanwhile, looked, on, with, caution, so, far, as, to, prevent, a, journalist, from, writing, about, vargas, s, audiences, in, diario, de, noticias, back, in, porto, alegre, believing, it, would, pass, off, as, an, attempt, for, the, presidency, acknowledging, medeiros, s, autocratic, philosophy, was, the, reason, for, this, a, successor, was, in, medeiros, s, control, and, he, could, have, vetoed, any, nomination, despite, this, vargas, had, many, beneficial, factors, on, his, side, medeiros, s, debt, his, national, achievements, his, distancing, from, intrastate, quarrels, his, popularity, amongst, party, youth, such, as, aranha, and, his, ability, to, mediate, difficult, situations, medeiros, selected, vargas, as, his, successor, followed, by, vargas, s, resignation, from, lu, s, s, cabinet, in, late, 1927, with, the, lack, of, an, opposition, and, the, republican, political, machine, vargas, s, election, was, assured, and, he, became, the, president, of, the, state, with, his, term, set, to, expire, in, 1932, vargas, was, active, throughout, his, two, year, tenure, in, one, instance, he, vetoed, dishonest, election, results, which, favored, his, political, party, in, another, he, negotiated, a, ceasefire, between, his, state, s, two, warring, factions, and, successfully, ended, decades, of, hostility, with, that, he, also, made, peace, with, other, groups, in, the, state, such, as, making, concessions, to, liberationists, levine, states, as, governor, vargas, achieved, bipartisan, support, for, his, government, for, the, first, time, in, generations, along, with, aranha, who, carried, out, his, economic, program, he, provided, credit, to, cattle, ranchers, and, created, interventionist, cooperatives, to, bring, in, resources, and, lower, export, prices, for, agriculture, vargas, established, the, banco, do, rio, grande, do, sul, bank, of, rio, grande, do, sul, to, lend, money, to, farmers, and, touched, upon, education, mining, agriculture, and, roads, the, people, rallied, around, him, as, vargas, promoted, the, planting, of, wheat, and, created, a, department, of, agriculture, vargas, doubled, the, amount, of, primary, schools, in, the, state, oversaw, the, construction, of, bridges, and, roads, and, revisited, the, railroad, contract, between, rio, grande, do, sul, and, the, federal, government, in, order, to, favor, the, state, despite, that, he, remained, loyal, to, lu, s, s, administration, and, maintained, ties, to, the, federal, government, vargas, also, championed, the, varig, airline, and, improved, law, courts, throughout, much, of, the, first, or, old, republic, 1889, 1930, brazilian, politics, were, consolidated, in, an, oligarchic, alliance, known, as, coffee, with, milk, politics, also, referred, to, as, coffee, and, cream, this, alliance, joined, politicians, from, the, dominant, states, of, s, o, paulo, and, minas, gerais, starting, in, the, 1910s, there, was, much, discontent, with, the, republic, including, a, general, strike, in, 1917, and, several, failed, tenente, revolts, of, discontent, junior, military, officers, throughout, the, 1920s, world, coffee, prices, crashed, in, october, 1929, and, with, them, the, brazilian, economy, in, the, midst, of, unrest, and, the, collapse, of, the, economy, president, lu, s, broke, the, coffee, and, milk, agreement, declaring, j, lio, prestes, a, politician, from, s, o, paulo, his, successor, instead, of, a, person, from, minas, gerais, violating, the, four, decade, old, oligarchy, vargas, publicly, announced, his, views, on, the, old, republic, in, a, proclamation, on, 4, october, 1930, the, people, are, starving, and, oppressed, representative, government, has, been, destroyed, by, the, oligarchies, and, the, professional, politicians, brutality, violence, and, squandering, of, public, funds, is, seen, at, every, level, of, brazilian, national, politics, the, ensuing, political, crisis, of, lu, s, choosing, a, paulista, to, succeed, him, led, to, the, formation, of, the, liberal, alliance, alian, a, liberal, consisting, of, minas, gerais, rio, grande, do, sul, and, para, ba, forming, an, opposition, to, prestes, and, nominating, vargas, who, led, a, broad, coalition, of, middle, class, industrialists, planters, from, outside, s, o, paulo, and, the, tenentes, for, the, presidency, support, for, vargas, was, especially, strong, in, the, states, of, the, alliance, during, the, campaign, vargas, had, also, been, careful, not, to, offend, planter, landowners, though, he, did, advocate, moderate, social, reform, and, economic, nationalism, the, liberal, alliance, amongst, other, social, issues, pushed, for, agricultural, schools, industrial, training, centres, sanitation, to, the, countryside, establishing, workers, vacations, and, a, minimum, wage, political, reforms, individuals, freedom, and, consumer, co, operatives, the, majority, of, which, vargas, would, go, on, to, install, in, the, brazilian, economy, much, to, the, distaste, of, the, opposition, j, lio, prestes, was, declared, winner, of, the, 1930, election, this, however, did, not, go, without, many, claims, of, electoral, fraud, though, fraud, was, committed, on, both, sides, electoral, machines, produced, votes, in, all, brazilian, states, including, rio, grande, do, sul, where, vargas, won, 298, 627, votes, to, 982, although, many, in, the, opposition, considered, orchestrating, a, coup, following, the, results, vargas, claimed, that, they, did, not, have, enough, power, to, dispute, the, election, successfully, it, seemed, the, planned, coup, would, not, be, executed, however, in, the, wake, of, the, assassination, of, jo, o, pessoa, vargas, s, running, mate, for, romantic, reasons, the, opposition, decided, it, was, ultimately, time, to, take, up, arms, and, vargas, agreed, although, the, president, was, elected, in, march, he, wasn, t, to, be, sworn, in, until, november, leaving, time, for, lu, s, to, transition, power, to, the, president, elect, prestes, alongside, his, co, conspirators, vargas, planned, to, overthrow, the, federal, government, in, an, armed, revolution, this, revolution, known, as, the, revolution, of, 1930, began, on, 3, october, railway, workers, went, on, strike, in, recife, the, capital, of, pernambuco, citizens, invaded, government, buildings, seized, an, arsenal, and, wrecked, a, telephone, station, revolutionaries, quickly, took, control, of, the, northeast, and, a, large, military, confrontation, in, s, o, paulo, seemed, imminent, this, however, never, happened, as, lu, s, resigned, on, 24, october, 1930, at, the, urging, of, both, the, military, and, cardinal, dom, sebasti, o, leme, a, short, lived, junta, of, brazil, s, military, leaders, took, charge, of, the, government, revolutionary, leaders, surprised, at, the, ousting, of, the, president, were, concerned, as, it, had, been, done, without, previous, notice, to, the, revolutionaries, vargas, went, by, train, to, s, o, paulo, and, continued, toward, rio, de, janeiro, then, the, nation, s, capital, and, telegraphed, to, the, junta, on, 24, october, 1930, i, am, on, the, s, o, paulo, border, with, thirty, thousand, men, perfectly, armed, and, acting, in, combination, with, the, states, of, rio, grande, do, sul, paran, santa, catarina, minas, gerais, and, the, north, not, to, depose, washington, luis, but, to, realise, the, program, of, the, revolution, i, am, merely, a, transitory, expression, of, the, collective, will, members, of, the, junta, of, rio, de, janeiro, will, be, accepted, as, collaborators, but, not, directors, since, these, elements, joined, the, revolution, at, the, time, when, its, success, was, assured, under, these, conditions, i, will, enter, with, the, southern, forces, into, the, state, of, s, o, paulo, which, will, be, occupied, by, troops, i, can, trust, we, will, arrange, the, trip, to, rio, later, it, is, unnecessary, for, me, to, say, that, the, march, upon, s, o, paulo, and, the, subsequent, military, occupation, is, merely, to, guarantee, military, order, we, have, no, desire, to, antagonise, or, humiliate, our, brothers, from, this, state, who, deserve, only, our, esteem, and, appreciation, before, beginning, our, march, for, s, o, paulo, tomorrow, i, want, to, hear, any, proposals, that, the, junta, may, wish, to, make, vargas, arrived, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, a, uniform, and, wide, brimmed, pampa, hat, with, 3, 000, soldiers, in, the, city, in, preparation, of, his, arrival, the, junta, withdrew, from, power, and, installed, vargas, as, interim, president, on, 3, november, 1930, vargas, s, provisional, presidency, began, on, 3, november, 1930, when, he, assumed, unlimited, power, from, the, provisional, government, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, of, 1930, and, gave, a, speech, detailing, a, 17, point, program, he, imprisoned, his, prominent, political, opponents, and, instead, of, taking, the, constitutional, solution, where, vargas, would, act, within, the, boundaries, of, the, 1891, constitution, and, he, would, be, declared, victor, of, the, 1930, election, vargas, chose, the, revolutionary, solution, and, assumed, emergency, powers, with, a, provisional, government, as, he, had, told, aranha, from, ponta, grossa, even, amongst, the, poorest, of, brazilians, vargas, had, brought, hope, to, them, something, which, drove, him, to, oblige, to, his, goals, for, now, the, brazilian, people, lived, under, a, regime, lacking, political, parties, and, one, which, governed, by, decree, which, they, accepted, vargas, also, held, sympathies, for, a, corporatist, state, the, old, political, formula, stressing, the, rights, of, man, appears, to, be, decadent, instead, of, individualism, synonym, for, an, excess, of, liberty, and, of, communism, a, new, mentality, for, slavery, the, perfect, co, ordination, of, all, initiatives, should, prevail, circumscribed, within, the, orbit, of, the, state, and, class, organisations, should, be, recognised, as, collaborators, in, public, administration, through, his, provisional, government, it, was, apparent, that, vargas, was, attempting, to, centralize, his, power, after, dissolving, state, and, municipal, legislatures, as, well, as, the, national, congress, vargas, assumed, all, policymaking, power, of, the, legislative, and, executive, branches, and, the, ability, to, name, and, dismiss, public, officials, at, will, though, the, judiciary, branch, was, allowed, to, remain, with, modification, on, all, levels, of, government, ensuring, his, support, vargas, also, named, federal, intervenors, to, administer, the, brazilian, states, and, replace, presidents, governors, with, the, only, exception, being, minas, gerais, where, the, president, was, allowed, to, remain, as, interventor, nearly, all, these, actions, were, perscribed, in, a, single, decree, on, 11, november, 1930, since, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, there, was, no, longer, any, demand, for, brazil, s, agricultural, production, planters, found, financial, ruin, unemployment, in, cities, grew, foreign, revenue, declined, and, convertible, money, was, no, longer, in, circulation, for, instance, the, price, of, coffee, was, 22, 5, cents, per, pound, in, 1929, but, this, plummeted, to, a, mere, eight, cents, in, 1931, though, vargas, promoted, the, diversification, of, agriculture, especially, with, cotton, he, also, recognized, that, he, could, not, abandon, the, coffee, sector, which, brazil, was, highly, dependent, upon, therefore, the, vargas, government, took, measures, to, address, the, sector, s, financial, ruin, on, 10, february, 1933, vargas, created, the, national, coffee, department, dnc, departamento, nacional, do, caf, and, in, march, 1931, vargas, issued, a, decree, which, barred, imports, of, machinery, for, industries, suffering, from, overproduction, still, vargas, s, government, was, faced, with, a, major, problem, large, stocks, of, coffee, had, no, demand, on, the, international, market, in, july, 1931, the, government, using, the, money, it, received, via, export, taxes, and, exchange, taxes, would, purchase, excess, coffee, and, destroy, some, of, it, doing, such, the, price, of, coffee, would, be, sustained, and, the, supply, would, be, reduced, the, plan, lasted, many, years, only, ending, in, 1944, by, that, point, vargas, s, government, had, destroyed, 78, 200, 000, sacks, of, coffee, equivalent, to, the, world, s, consumption, for, three, years, according, to, historians, boris, and, sergio, fausto, one, of, the, more, coherent, aspects, of, the, vargas, administration, was, its, labor, policy, between, 1930, and, 1945, it, passed, through, several, stages, but, from, the, beginning, it, appeared, as, innovative, as, far, as, what, preceded, it, was, concerned, its, main, objectives, were, to, repress, efforts, of, the, urban, working, class, to, organize, outside, the, aegis, of, the, state, and, to, incorpoate, the, working, class, into, the, government, s, array, of, supporters, to, achieve, these, goals, vargas, notably, created, the, ministry, of, labor, industry, and, commerce, minist, rio, do, trabalho, in, november, 1930, nominating, lindolfo, collor, as, the, first, minister, of, labor, laws, were, passed, to, protect, workers, a, march, 1931, decree, brought, unions, into, line, and, vargas, s, government, established, the, bureaus, of, reconciliation, and, arbitration, juntas, de, concilia, o, e, julgamento, to, mediate, worker, boss, affairs, to, protect, the, rights, of, brazilian, workers, the, government, limited, immigration, and, required, that, at, least, two, thirds, of, all, workers, at, any, given, factory, be, brazilian, the, president, gained, considerable, support, from, organized, labor, with, his, government, beginning, construction, on, long, promised, workers, housing, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, s, o, paulo, despite, it, being, under, par, compared, to, the, needs, of, the, growing, population, he, also, began, taking, repressive, measures, toward, leftist, organizations, in, respect, to, the, economy, particularly, the, brazilian, communist, party, the, economic, regulations, vargas, imposed, however, were, still, being, circumvented, as, late, as, 1941, while, it, was, impossible, for, the, minimum, wage, laws, to, be, evaded, by, large, businesses, or, in, large, towns, the, minimum, rural, salary, of, 1943, was, in, many, cases, simply, not, abided, by, employers, in, fact, many, social, policies, never, extended, to, rural, areas, while, each, state, varied, social, legislation, was, enforced, less, by, the, government, and, more, by, the, good, will, of, employers, and, officials, in, the, remote, regions, of, brazil, vargas, s, legislation, did, more, for, the, industrial, workers, than, for, the, more, numerous, agricultural, workers, despite, the, fact, that, only, relatively, few, industrial, workers, joined, the, unions, that, the, government, encouraged, the, state, run, social, security, system, was, inefficient, and, the, institute, for, retirement, and, social, welfare, produced, few, results, the, popular, backlash, due, to, these, shortcomings, was, evidenced, by, the, rising, popularity, of, the, national, liberation, alliance, a, leftist, front, in, 1935, moreover, the, faustos, state, that, the, nation, s, financial, situation, became, untenable, halfway, through, 1931, payments, on, brazil, s, foreign, debt, ceased, in, september, of, the, same, year, and, the, bank, of, brazil, had, once, more, been, granted, sole, permission, to, exchange, currency, a, measure, that, had, originally, been, put, in, place, by, president, lu, s, s, government, yet, repealed, by, vargas, s, provisional, government, brazil, had, had, a, close, cooperation, between, the, church, and, state, by, the, time, vargas, assumed, power, the, collaboration, began, mostly, in, the, 1920s, under, the, administration, of, artur, bernardes, vargas, now, made, the, relationship, much, closer, evident, in, the, unveiling, of, the, statue, of, christ, the, redeemer, on, 12, october, 1931, vargas, and, his, ministers, were, present, at, the, unveiling, and, cardinal, leme, who, was, influential, in, the, ousting, of, president, lu, s, declared, brazil, as, the, most, holy, heart, of, jesus, whom, it, recognized, as, its, king, and, lord, vargas, s, government, took, special, measures, in, favor, of, the, church, and, the, church, received, support, for, the, new, government, from, the, majority, of, brazil, s, catholics, in, april, 1931, a, decree, allowed, religion, to, be, taught, in, public, schools, this, was, all, despite, the, fact, that, vargas, was, firmly, agnostic, though, darci, practiced, roman, catholicism, going, as, far, as, to, name, his, first, son, lutero, an, un, catholic, name, his, purpose, for, the, union, between, the, church, and, state, was, to, build, popular, support, for, his, government, through, the, channeling, of, religious, feelings, toward, the, state, though, hoping, to, tackle, the, issue, of, education, as, well, vargas, s, government, immediately, introduced, new, measures, to, improve, what, was, perceived, as, a, problem, in, brazil, like, religion, reform, was, tried, in, the, 1920s, at, first, beginning, at, the, state, level, however, vargas, s, new, government, sought, to, centralize, education, creating, the, ministry, of, education, and, health, in, november, 1930, the, initiatives, were, based, on, authoritarianism, and, a, hybrid, between, hierarchical, values, and, catholic, conservatism, though, it, was, never, considered, fascist, indoctrination, major, reforms, also, took, hold, in, higher, education, with, vargas, s, government, creating, conditions, favorable, to, universities, vargas, s, reforms, were, limited, however, though, his, laws, were, in, existence, the, enforcement, of, those, laws, was, lackluster, in, 1948, an, sio, teixeira, considered, to, be, brazil, s, greatest, education, reformer, reviewed, the, education, reform, done, in, the, state, of, bahia, after, twenty, years, 1928, 1948, on, 16, april, 1948, teixeira, gave, a, speech, in, the, capital, salvador, most, of, the, state, s, educational, efforts, are, performed, by, a, cadre, of, primary, schoolteachers, centered, in, cities, or, dispersed, throughout, the, interior, where, in, almost, all, cases, there, are, no, school, buildings, only, makeshift, classrooms, and, virtually, no, teaching, materials, there, are, few, state, funded, secondary, schools, in, bahia, which, lamentably, is, disorganized, and, congested, and, only, three, institutions, to, train, elementary, level, teachers, only, one, of, them, has, adequate, facilities, in, spite, of, the, strangulation, and, humiliation, there, are, still, noble, examples, of, teachers, devotion, and, persistence, the, adjustment, from, the, old, republic, to, a, new, regime, was, painful, despite, vargas, s, reforms, after, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, recife, in, may, 1931, aranha, and, general, leite, de, castro, presented, vargas, with, a, decree, which, would, declare, martial, law, for, mutinies, vargas, told, them, to, redraft, it, and, aranha, told, vargas, s, secretary, this, get, lio, has, a, passive, resistance, that, is, enervating, while, vargas, increased, his, support, with, senior, army, officers, bloody, riots, broke, out, in, recife, in, october, 1931, in, february, 1932, the, democratic, party, of, s, o, paulo, joined, forces, with, republicans, in, a, united, front, against, vargas, there, was, even, a, front, in, vargas, s, home, state, of, rio, grande, do, sul, pushing, for, a, seven, point, program, the, instant, restoration, of, individuals, rights, the, guarantee, of, freedom, of, the, press, and, the, election, of, a, constituent, assembly, at, this, point, some, foreign, diplomats, had, much, doubt, vargas, had, any, control, of, events, observing, the, division, between, revolutionary, leaders, and, unrest, in, the, country, the, painful, transition, between, regimes, was, most, evident, in, the, 1932, constitutionalist, revolution, a, three, month, long, civil, war, in, brazil, 9, july, 2, october, 1932, which, pitted, s, o, paulo, now, suffering, as, their, interests, and, pride, were, lost, against, the, federal, government, in, the, name, of, a, free, constitution, furthermore, the, state, of, s, o, paulo, was, distressed, with, vargas, s, implementation, of, interventors, to, replace, state, presidents, s, o, paulo, s, interventor, jo, o, alberto, lins, de, barros, was, extremely, unpopular, in, the, state, becoming, the, subject, of, hostility, by, politicians, and, the, press, despite, his, best, efforts, to, appease, them, he, was, forced, to, resign, in, july, 1931, after, a, minor, rebellion, in, april, of, that, year, and, three, separate, interventors, succeeded, him, until, mid, 1932, including, a, civilian, interventor, vargas, appointed, in, march, the, state, believed, minas, gerais, and, rio, grande, do, sul, would, join, them, and, a, potential, coup, would, transpire, which, was, not, the, case, however, vargas, felt, depressed, during, the, crisis, with, both, alzira, and, monteiro, noting, he, was, passing, through, an, abrupt, mental, stage, at, the, beginning, of, the, revolt, although, federal, forces, defeated, the, revolutionaries, a, new, constitution, would, be, enacted, two, years, later, in, the, aftermath, vargas, meanwhile, enforced, soft, peace, terms, ordered, the, federal, government, to, pay, half, of, the, rebels, debt, and, refused, to, bomb, or, invade, the, city, of, s, o, paulo, during, the, conflict, rather, limiting, fighting, to, the, outskirts, of, the, city, vargas, especially, during, his, early, years, was, always, in, danger, of, being, ousted, by, one, or, more, of, the, groups, in, his, coalition, including, the, anti, s, o, paulo, planters, the, bourgeoisie, and, the, military, rumors, circulated, in, his, provisional, presidency, about, coups, both, left, and, right, wing, though, they, had, no, basis, under, vargas, s, regime, the, federal, government, maintained, a, responsibility, for, protecting, the, secret, vote, in, elections, and, many, voting, reforms, were, introduced, including, the, establishment, of, the, electoral, justice, women, s, suffrage, and, a, lowering, of, the, voting, age, from, twenty, one, to, eighteen, fraud, was, reduced, and, the, electoral, justice, was, tasked, with, the, organization, and, oversight, of, elections, and, the, judgement, of, appeals, prior, to, the, s, o, paulo, revolt, vargas, made, a, promise, to, hold, elections, in, a, speech, in, may, 1932, the, same, speech, highlighted, the, achievements, produced, by, the, provisional, government, including, education, reform, and, a, balanced, budget, he, contrasted, the, contemporary, history, of, england, and, france, to, brazil, s, situation, justifying, the, need, for, emergency, powers, during, an, economic, crisis, vargas, fulfilled, his, promise, when, in, may, 1933, elections, for, a, national, constituent, assembly, were, held, there, was, an, increase, in, popular, participation, as, well, as, party, organization, the, communist, party, was, banned, however, and, the, many, parties, that, appeared, were, in, states, there, were, no, national, parties, with, the, exception, of, the, right, wing, brazilian, integralist, action, the, constituent, assembly, elected, under, vargas, s, provisional, presidency, convened, from, 1933, until, 1934, after, months, of, debate, they, initiated, a, new, constitution, of, brazil, the, third, one, in, its, history, which, guaranteed, an, impartial, judiciary, government, responsibility, for, the, economy, and, general, welfare, similar, to, the, constitution, of, 1891, it, established, a, federal, republic, in, brazil, and, it, was, modeled, after, germany, s, weimar, constitution, the, new, constitution, reflected, vargas, s, earlier, reforms, it, dealt, with, minimum, wage, labor, rights, compulsory, attendance, and, free, primary, schools, classes, in, religion, although, it, was, open, to, all, religions, and, elective, in, public, schools, and, national, security, the, constitution, went, into, force, on, 14, july, 1934, and, the, constituent, assembly, which, would, be, succeeded, by, the, chamber, of, deputies, elected, vargas, on, 15, july, to, a, four, year, term, to, continue, his, presidency, now, constitutionally, vargas, s, constitutional, presidency, was, set, to, expire, on, 3, may, 1938, historian, thomas, skidmore, reflected, on, vargas, s, transition, to, a, new, regime, it, looked, as, if, brazil, was, finally, going, to, be, allowed, an, experiment, in, modern, democracy, vargas, had, originally, offered, lu, s, carlos, prestes, the, position, as, head, of, the, military, in, 1930, but, prestes, refused, opting, instead, to, lead, the, brazilian, communist, party, the, communist, party, faced, a, problem, however, their, doctrine, revolved, around, urban, workers, whereas, brazil, was, still, an, agricultural, society, urban, workers, were, mostly, from, rural, backgrounds, and, did, not, want, to, participate, and, workers, who, did, were, difficult, to, organize, still, fear, circulated, amongst, politicians, and, generals, and, repressive, measures, were, taken, against, communists, on, 19, january, 1931, vargas, ordered, any, communists, be, arrested, and, their, property, seized, communists, staged, marches, counter, marches, and, street, fights, comparative, to, the, climate, in, central, europe, the, communist, party, and, communist, international, hoped, a, military, coup, would, overthrow, the, brazilian, government, weaken, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, and, strengthen, the, soviet, union, in, november, 1935, a, series, of, uprisings, at, military, bases, in, natal, recife, and, rio, de, janeiro, culminated, in, the, communist, uprising, of, 1935, comintern, believed, they, had, sufficientally, infiltrated, the, army, to, allow, prestes, to, carry, out, the, coup, but, vargas, s, forces, crushed, all, revolts, in, reality, the, uprising, played, into, vargas, s, hands, comintern, and, the, communist, party, were, unaware, they, were, under, surveillance, by, brazilian, police, and, their, attack, gave, evidence, for, a, bolshevik, threat, skidmore, said, that, vargas, s, government, had, a, propaganda, field, day, after, it, crushed, the, revolt, circulating, wildly, exaggerated, stories, later, discredited, by, military, records, about, loyalist, officers, shot, unarmed, in, their, beds, immediately, after, the, revolt, vargas, convinced, the, national, congress, to, declare, a, state, of, emergency, during, which, he, suspended, civil, rights, jailed, trade, unionists, and, his, opposition, increased, presidential, powers, and, bolstered, police, powers, for, the, next, two, years, after, the, 1935, revolt, vargas, would, keep, persuading, the, congress, to, renew, the, ninety, day, state, of, siege, a, period, where, the, government, held, extraordinary, police, powers, and, there, were, growing, concerns, vargas, was, preparing, a, self, coup, prestes, was, also, jailed, in, 1936, and, sentenced, to, over, sixteen, years, in, prison, he, would, later, be, released, in, 1945, and, campaigned, for, vargas, s, policy, the, same, year, the, fears, of, vargas, carrying, out, a, self, coup, were, amplified, by, the, authoritarian, and, pro, german, military, perceptions, of, his, two, top, generals, pedro, aur, lio, de, g, is, monteiro, and, minister, of, war, eurico, gaspar, dutra, he, was, becoming, increasingly, dependent, on, the, military, for, support, and, political, attention, now, turned, to, the, 1938, presidential, elections, now, vargas, s, opposition, turned, to, supporting, armando, salles, de, oliveira, a, member, of, the, paulista, elite, who, skidmore, says, were, now, trying, to, gain, through, the, vote, what, they, had, failed, to, gain, by, arms, in, 1932, while, vargas, government, supported, writer, and, minor, politician, from, the, northeast, jose, americo, de, almeida, the, paulistas, were, now, confident, as, they, sought, and, received, support, from, those, against, vargas, all, the, while, vargas, s, power, was, loosening, political, debates, allowed, for, repressive, measures, to, be, unfastened, 300, people, were, let, out, of, prison, by, order, of, the, minister, of, justice, vargas, and, his, government, did, not, trust, any, of, the, three, candidates, and, one, government, observer, even, believed, brazil, was, at, risk, of, becoming, another, spain, that, is, torn, apart, by, civil, war, leading, up, to, the, coup, which, would, place, vargas, as, dictator, he, was, a, somewhat, depressed, man, and, he, never, seemed, to, admit, to, himself, he, enjoyed, his, power, however, after, a, meeting, with, monteiro, and, j, s, maciel, filho, the, president, became, reenergized, as, evident, by, his, following, journal, entries, though, he, was, still, saddened, by, the, upcoming, elections, one, week, before, the, coup, vargas, celebrated, the, seventh, anniversary, of, his, rise, to, power, devoting, the, evening, to, a, long, conversation, with, monteiro, the, pretext, for, the, coup, was, enunciated, in, the, form, of, the, cohen, plan, a, document, discovered, in, september, 1937, at, the, ministry, of, war, detailing, plans, for, a, violent, communist, uprising, in, actuality, the, document, was, a, blatant, falsification, after, the, cohen, plan, s, revelation, on, 10, november, 1937, the, coup, was, executed, all, but, one, cabinet, member, signed, the, constitution, per, vargas, s, request, military, troops, surrounded, the, national, congress, and, refused, entry, to, congressmen, and, the, 1937, constitution, corporatist, and, totalitarian, was, now, in, force, the, 1938, presidential, elections, were, canceled, and, brazil, became, a, dictatorship, called, the, estado, novo, or, new, state, led, by, vargas, the, national, congress, acquiesced, after, some, congressmen, were, imprisoned, and, eighty, legislators, went, to, see, vargas, in, a, show, of, support, on, 13, november, meanwhile, life, went, on, as, usual, in, brazil, as, the, population, took, the, transition, calmly, vargas, s, most, prominent, opponents, were, either, arrested, or, exiled, as, censorship, concealed, the, media, and, the, police, were, given, increased, powers, the, public, fell, silent, like, when, he, took, office, vargas, effectively, ruled, by, decree, the, integralists, were, initially, supportive, of, the, coup, and, the, transition, toward, right, wing, politics, anticipating, their, fellow, integralista, pl, nio, salgado, to, be, offered, a, cabinet, position, specifically, the, minister, of, education, the, opposite, ensued, vargas, s, government, enforced, new, restrictions, on, the, movement, s, activities, in, retaliation, a, band, of, integralists, tried, to, overthrow, the, federal, government, themselves, from, 10, through, 11, may, 1938, armed, integralists, and, disloyal, palace, guards, attacked, the, presidential, palace, in, an, effort, to, depose, him, they, began, firing, at, the, building, where, vargas, was, sleeping, entering, into, a, multihour, long, siege, with, vargas, and, alzira, federal, reinforcements, arrived, at, vargas, s, aid, four, attackers, were, killed, with, the, rest, being, imprisoned, salgado, sought, exile, in, portugal, meanwhile, the, result, of, the, incident, was, a, temporary, chill, on, german, brazilian, relations, most, of, the, constitution, was, produced, by, a, single, man, anti, liberal, and, anti, communist, francisco, campos, future, minister, of, justice, for, vargas, the, new, constitution, was, highly, detailed, and, comprehensive, even, more, so, since, campos, was, working, in, a, rush, article, ii, stated, that, there, shall, be, only, one, flag, hymn, and, motto, throughout, the, country, for, instance, campos, would, later, hold, a, press, conference, and, publicize, the, establishment, of, the, national, press, council, created, for, the, intention, of, perfect, coordination, with, the, government, in, the, control, of, the, news, and, of, political, and, doctrinal, material, in, general, the, new, era, incorporated, components, from, european, fascism, though, the, president, relied, on, the, army, for, support, rather, than, political, parties, antiliberalism, was, also, very, apparent, vargas, outlawed, all, political, parties, on, 2, december, 1937, a, plebiscite, to, approve, the, new, regime, was, abandoned, the, proposed, congress, never, convened, and, vargas, s, term, of, office, was, prolonged, by, six, years, personally, vargas, told, foreign, reporters, the, estado, novo, was, democratic, at, heart, but, promoted, authoritarianism, at, home, when, alzira, asked, him, about, the, plebiscite, vargas, replied, the, whole, purpose, of, the, coup, of, november, 10, was, to, avoid, any, electoral, action, which, could, prejudice, us, at, this, time, and, yet, you, ask, me, questions, about, the, plebiscite, industrial, expansion, was, performed, and, support, for, coffee, was, diminished, campos, had, suggested, a, totalitarian, party, and, the, minister, of, education, requested, a, fascist, youth, program, both, of, which, vargas, demonstrated, little, enthusiasm, for, and, buried, brasilidade, led, to, a, reform, of, portuguese, spelling, and, the, closure, of, foreign, language, schools, and, newspapers, with, the, main, targets, being, german, and, italian, communities, in, regard, to, fundamental, issues, vargas, s, personal, power, was, the, deciding, factor, trust, between, the, president, and, his, ministers, increased, and, between, march, 1938, and, june, 1941, there, was, not, a, change, in, ministers, according, to, historian, teresa, meade, because, the, major, social, reforms, of, the, estado, novo, were, enactment, of, a, minimum, wage, law, and, the, codification, of, all, labor, reforms, since, 1930, into, a, single, labor, act, vargas, was, able, to, win, to, his, party, the, devotion, of, the, urban, workers, such, labor, laws, were, also, centered, around, corporatism, vargas, s, image, as, the, workers, guardian, took, hold, in, ceremonies, such, as, the, may, day, celebration, where, masses, would, gather, he, used, the, radio, to, communicate, and, bring, workers, and, the, government, together, and, the, labor, minister, gave, weekly, radio, speeches, from, 1930, until, 1938, the, wage, index, rose, from, 230, to, 315, points, this, contrasted, with, the, cost, of, living, however, from, 290, to, 490, points, with, the, cost, of, living, doubling, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, nearly, tripling, in, s, o, paulo, however, in, respect, to, the, great, depression, brazil, reemerged, from, the, economic, crisis, sooner, than, the, united, kingdom, or, the, united, states, a, comeback, sustained, by, world, war, ii, production, american, technology, and, brazilians, turning, to, brazilian, producers, when, shipping, was, interrupted, beginning, in, 1935, industrialists, became, interested, in, establishing, oil, refineries, in, the, country, such, as, standard, oil, 1936, and, texaco, 1938, amongst, others, who, established, huge, refineries, in, brazil, though, they, would, be, nationalized, in, brazilian, hands, in, april, 1938, via, decree, law, the, president, also, decided, to, stop, paying, the, national, debt, right, after, the, coup, too, proclaiming, that, brazil, could, either, modernize, its, armed, forces, and, transportation, or, pay, the, debt, popular, culture, was, also, an, important, aspect, of, vargas, s, dictatorship, in, 1941, his, government, created, the, national, sport, council, and, as, skidmore, concludes, vargas, was, one, of, the, first, politicians, to, appreciate, the, political, payoff, from, supporting, it, another, example, was, the, rio, carnival, vargas, s, government, was, the, first, on, the, federal, level, to, support, samba, schools, and, rio, parades, both, of, which, had, become, a, universal, symbol, of, brazilian, culture, two, achievements, resulted, an, economic, benefit, tourism, and, a, greater, national, identity, moreover, vargas, s, government, launched, an, elaborate, campaign, of, restoring, historic, and, religious, architecture, sculpture, and, painting, in, petr, polis, the, imperial, museum, of, brazil, was, restored, and, the, ministry, of, education, and, culture, building, in, rio, de, janeiro, which, was, designed, by, brazilian, architect, oscar, niemeyer, construction, began, in, 1936, and, finished, in, 1943, a, darker, side, to, the, vargas, sponsored, work, with, a, national, identity, was, to, protect, the, country, from, those, who, were, deemed, un, brazilian, such, as, japanese, brazilians, or, jewish, brazilians, official, and, unofficial, discrimination, was, performed, limited, mainly, to, closing, foreign, newspapers, schools, and, organizations, but, it, never, reached, the, magnitude, of, nazi, germany, in, europe, nazi, germany, viewed, brazil, as, a, key, trading, partner, from, 1933, to, 1938, a, time, period, encompassing, parts, of, all, three, periods, of, vargas, s, first, presidency, german, brazilian, trade, magnified, principally, germany, bought, brazilian, cotton, in, return, for, german, industrial, goods, all, the, while, the, united, kingdom, being, the, main, loser, germany, hoped, to, lure, brazil, into, the, german, politico, military, sphere, they, sold, weapons, to, brazil, and, offered, technical, training, and, the, 1937, coup, was, praised, in, germany, and, italy, the, u, k, did, have, a, major, role, in, aiding, vargas, s, police, and, intelligence, forces, though, british, agents, provided, information, on, foreign, threats, and, assisted, the, country, during, the, 1935, communist, uprising, meanwhile, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1937, coup, the, united, states, immediately, asked, for, an, explanation, from, brazil, s, ambassador, aranha, the, u, s, recognized, brazil, s, strategic, position, on, the, atlantic, coast, and, the, potential, of, it, playing, a, vital, role, in, dominating, air, and, sea, traffic, the, american, military, worried, the, coup, would, bring, brazil, closer, to, nazi, germany, aware, of, vargas, advisers, specifically, dutra, s, and, monteiro, s, beliefs, they, had, been, struggling, to, influence, brazil, and, the, existence, of, a, large, german, speaking, population, in, brazil, s, south, strengthened, american, fears, of, the, vargas, dictatorship, under, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, united, states, began, the, good, neighbor, policy, toward, latin, america, in, what, bourne, describes, as, a, modern, monroe, doctrine, similar, to, pre, world, war, i, the, u, s, state, department, also, denounced, the, german, trade, policy, the, military, tried, to, counter, german, offers, of, arms, and, training, but, they, failed, vargas, had, in, fact, tried, to, negotiate, to, obtain, u, s, military, equipment, first, but, the, isolationist, united, states, congress, refused, even, outlawed, foreign, arms, sales, in, 1937, vargas, offered, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, use, of, brazilian, coastal, bases, but, the, offer, was, refused, this, was, most, likely, because, roosevelt, was, either, to, follow, the, u, s, congress, or, abandon, them, for, if, he, did, accept, the, offer, it, would, have, looked, like, he, was, preparing, for, war, in, 1938, vargas, sent, aim, e, de, heeren, see, personal, life, and, interim, to, paris, as, a, secret, agent, to, investigate, the, situation, in, europe, through, helmuth, james, von, moltke, she, obtained, secret, information, about, hitler, s, plans, for, the, jewish, population, prompting, her, to, use, all, her, influence, on, the, president, to, distance, brazil, from, the, axis, powers, in, 1939, at, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, vargas, and, roosevelt, both, remained, neutral, though, vargas, continued, to, foster, relations, with, the, axis, powers, by, 1941, however, vargas, still, left, his, options, open, approving, a, plan, to, modernize, north, and, northeast, airports, by, pan, american, airways, under, a, contract, by, the, u, s, army, when, japan, attacked, pearl, harbor, on, 7, december, 1941, and, the, leader, of, germany, adolf, hitler, declared, war, on, the, united, states, on, 11, december, it, became, apparent, that, brazil, s, military, odds, were, in, favor, of, the, allies, of, world, war, ii, this, was, reinforced, with, the, disastrous, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, by, germany, and, their, losses, in, the, atlantic, in, addition, the, u, s, was, already, forging, alliances, with, brazil, an, important, commercial, deal, in, 1939, and, the, sale, of, ninety, six, inch, 152, mm, surplus, guns, to, brazil, in, march, 1940, followed, by, a, visit, from, monteiro, to, the, united, states, in, october, centered, foreign, policy, with, the, u, s, with, this, brazil, declared, war, on, italy, and, germany, following, torpedo, attacks, on, brazilian, ships, and, the, sinking, of, a, brazilian, submarine, that, year, on, 21, august, 1942, providing, the, allies, with, raw, materials, and, brazil, s, strategic, coastline, the, siding, with, the, allies, led, to, monteiro, and, dutra, both, turning, in, their, resignations, which, the, president, rejected, moreover, vargas, struck, an, attractive, deal, in, exchange, for, raw, materials, the, u, s, military, provided, equipment, technical, assistance, and, financing, for, a, brazilian, steel, mill, at, volta, redonda, finalized, in, july, 1940, vargas, hoped, to, identify, brazil, with, the, allied, cause, he, offered, three, brazilian, army, divisions, to, fight, the, germans, in, the, mediterranean, with, the, purpose, of, dramatizing, brazil, s, role, in, the, war, and, to, uplift, brazilian, pride, at, home, additionally, a, contingent, of, the, army, fought, crucial, battles, in, the, italian, campaign, in, 1944, and, further, reinforced, war, pride, and, antifascism, vargas, insisted, every, state, be, represented, whatever, the, quality, of, local, recruits, his, government, now, held, even, more, power, as, the, need, to, ration, essentials, increased, and, centralization, persisted, yet, again, in, brazil, though, abroad, the, government, defended, democracy, there, was, increasing, discontent, at, home, when, world, war, ii, finished, due, to, the, authoritarian, policies, by, vargas, and, his, government, growing, political, movements, and, democratic, demonstrations, forced, vargas, to, abolish, censorship, in, 1945, release, numerous, political, prisoners, and, allow, for, the, reformation, of, political, parties, including, the, brazilian, communist, party, which, supported, vargas, after, direction, from, moscow, university, students, began, to, mobilize, in, 1943, against, vargas, strikes, which, were, banned, began, to, re, emerge, thanks, to, war, inflation, and, even, aranha, was, in, favor, of, a, democratic, shift, vargas, himself, built, support, after, establishing, the, brazilian, labour, party, and, his, aforementioned, support, from, urban, workers, and, also, found, help, from, the, left, when, it, applied, with, that, vargas, added, the, additional, act, to, the, constitution, which, among, other, things, provided, for, a, 90, day, period, during, which, a, time, and, date, for, elections, would, be, designated, precisely, ninety, days, afterward, the, new, electoral, code, was, issued, established, 2, december, 1945, for, the, election, of, the, president, and, a, new, constituent, assembly, and, state, elections, on, 6, may, 1946, furthermore, vargas, promulgated, his, intention, not, to, run, for, president, the, military, feared, that, vargas, was, about, to, seize, absolute, power, after, a, detrimental, move, on, 25, october, 1945, removing, jo, o, alberto, from, chief, of, police, of, the, federal, district, and, replacing, him, with, vargas, s, brother, benjamim, so, they, forced, his, resignation, and, deposed, him, on, 29, october, ending, his, first, presidency, in, the, 1945, elections, vargas, demonstrated, his, continued, popular, support, by, winning, election, as, senator, for, s, o, paulo, and, rio, grande, do, sul, and, member, of, the, chamber, of, deputies, from, nine, different, states, he, accepted, the, senate, seat, for, rio, grande, but, effectively, went, into, semiretirement, in, 1950, he, reemerged, as, a, prominent, political, force, when, he, ran, for, president, as, the, candidate, of, the, brazilian, labor, party, he, won, the, election, and, took, office, on, 31, january, 1951, when, he, left, the, estado, novo, presidency, the, economic, surplus, of, brazil, was, high, and, the, industry, was, growing, after, four, years, however, pro, u, s, president, dutra, wasted, huge, quantities, of, money, protecting, foreign, investments, mostly, north, american, and, distanced, himself, from, the, ideas, of, nationalism, and, the, country, s, modernisation, championed, by, vargas, vargas, returned, to, politics, in, 1951, and, through, a, free, and, secret, ballot, was, re, elected, president, of, the, republic, hampered, by, the, economic, crisis, largely, engendered, by, dutra, s, policies, vargas, pursued, a, nationalist, policy, turning, to, the, country, s, own, natural, resources, and, away, from, foreign, dependency, as, part, of, this, policy, he, founded, petrobras, brazilian, petroleum, a, multinational, petroleum, consortium, with, the, government, of, brazil, as, its, majority, stakeholder, vargas, political, adversaries, initiated, a, crisis, which, culminated, in, the, murder, of, an, air, force, officer, major, rubens, vaz, killed, during, an, assassination, attempt, in, the, street, outside, 180, rua, tonelero, the, home, of, vargas, main, adversary, publishing, executive, and, politician, carlos, lacerda, lieutenant, greg, rio, fortunato, chief, of, vargas, personal, guard, also, called, black, angel, was, implicated, in, the, crime, this, aroused, anger, in, the, military, against, vargas, following, which, the, generals, demanded, his, resignation, in, a, last, ditch, effort, vargas, called, a, special, cabinet, meeting, on, the, eve, of, 24, august, but, rumours, spread, that, the, armed, forces, officers, were, implacable, at, 8, 45, brt, on, 24, august, 1954, at, the, catete, palace, vargas, unable, to, manage, the, situation, shot, himself, in, the, chest, with, a, pistol, his, suicide, note, was, found, and, read, out, on, radio, within, two, hours, of, his, son, discovering, the, body, the, famous, last, lines, read, serenely, i, take, my, first, step, on, the, road, to, eternity, i, leave, life, to, enter, history, vargas, suicide, has, been, interpreted, in, various, ways, his, death, by, suicide, simultaneously, traded, on, the, image, of, a, valiant, warrior, selflessly, fighting, for, the, protection, of, national, interests, alongside, the, image, of, a, crafty, and, calculating, statesman, whose, political, machinations, reeked, of, demagoguery, and, self, interest, the, same, day, riots, broke, out, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, porto, alegre, the, vargas, family, refused, a, state, funeral, but, his, successor, caf, filho, declared, official, days, of, mourning, vargas, body, was, on, public, view, in, a, glass, topped, coffin, the, route, of, the, cortege, carrying, the, body, from, the, presidential, palace, to, the, airport, was, lined, with, tens, of, thousands, of, brazilians, the, burial, and, memorial, service, were, in, his, hometown, of, s, o, borja, rio, grande, do, sul, the, museu, hist, rico, nacional, mhn, was, given, the, furnishings, of, the, bedroom, where, vargas, died, by, suicide, and, a, museum, gallery, recreates, the, scene, and, is, a, site, of, remembrance, on, exhibit, in, the, palace, is, his, nightshirt, with, a, bullet, hole, in, the, chest, the, popular, outrage, caused, by, his, suicide, had, supposedly, been, strong, enough, to, thwart, the, ambitions, of, his, enemies, among, the, rightists, anti, nationalists, pro, u, s, elements, and, even, the, pro, prestes, brazilian, communist, party, for, several, years, many, historians, have, regarded, vargas, as, the, most, influential, brazilian, politician, of, the, 20th, century, as, well, as, the, first, to, draw, widespread, support, from, the, masses, having, fought, against, the, influence, of, the, elite, vargas, guided, brazil, through, the, great, depression, and, he, was, nicknamed, the,
