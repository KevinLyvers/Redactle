edward, drinker, cope, july, 28, 1840, april, 12, 1897, was, an, american, zoologist, paleontologist, comparative, anatomist, herpetologist, and, ichthyologist, born, to, a, wealthy, quaker, family, he, distinguished, himself, as, a, child, prodigy, interested, in, science, publishing, his, first, scientific, paper, at, the, age, of, 19, though, his, father, tried, to, raise, cope, as, a, gentleman, farmer, he, eventually, acquiesced, to, his, son, s, scientific, aspirations, cope, had, little, formal, scientific, training, and, he, eschewed, a, teaching, position, for, field, work, he, made, regular, trips, to, the, american, west, prospecting, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, often, as, a, member, of, u, s, geological, survey, teams, a, personal, feud, between, cope, and, paleontologist, othniel, charles, marsh, led, to, a, period, of, intense, fossil, finding, competition, now, known, as, the, bone, wars, cope, s, financial, fortunes, soured, after, failed, mining, ventures, in, the, 1880s, forcing, him, to, sell, off, much, of, his, fossil, collection, he, experienced, a, resurgence, in, his, career, toward, the, end, of, his, life, before, dying, on, april, 12, 1897, though, cope, s, scientific, pursuits, nearly, bankrupted, him, his, contributions, helped, to, define, the, field, of, american, paleontology, he, was, a, prodigious, writer, with, 1, 400, papers, published, over, his, lifetime, although, his, rivals, debated, the, accuracy, of, his, rapidly, published, works, he, discovered, described, and, named, more, than, 1, 000, vertebrate, species, including, hundreds, of, fishes, and, dozens, of, dinosaurs, his, proposal, for, the, origin, of, mammalian, molars, is, notable, among, his, theoretical, contributions, edward, drinker, cope, was, born, on, july, 28, 1840, the, eldest, son, of, alfred, cope, and, hannah, daughter, of, thomas, edge, of, chester, county, pennsylvania, he, was, a, distant, cousin, of, historian, gilbert, cope, his, middle, name, drinker, was, his, paternal, grandmother, s, maiden, name, she, being, daughter, of, john, drinker, of, philadelphia, the, cope, family, were, of, english, origin, the, first, to, settle, in, america, in, 1683, was, oliver, cope, a, tailor, formerly, of, avebury, wiltshire, who, was, granted, two, hundred, and, fifty, acres, in, delaware, the, death, of, his, mother, when, he, was, three, years, old, seemed, to, have, had, little, effect, on, young, edward, as, he, mentioned, in, his, letters, that, he, had, no, recollection, of, her, his, stepmother, rebecca, biddle, filled, the, maternal, role, cope, referred, to, her, warmly, as, well, as, his, younger, stepbrother, james, biddle, cope, alfred, an, orthodox, member, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, quakers, operated, a, lucrative, shipping, business, started, by, his, father, thomas, p, cope, in, 1821, he, was, a, philanthropist, who, gave, money, to, the, edward, was, born, and, raised, in, a, large, stone, house, called, fairfield, whose, location, is, now, within, the, boundaries, of, philadelphia, the, 8, acres, 3, 2, ha, of, pristine, and, exotic, gardens, of, the, house, offered, a, landscape, that, edward, was, able, to, explore, the, copes, began, teaching, their, children, to, read, and, write, while, very, young, and, took, edward, on, trips, across, new, england, and, to, museums, zoos, and, gardens, cope, s, interest, in, animals, became, apparent, at, a, young, age, as, did, his, natural, artistic, ability, alfred, intended, to, give, his, son, the, same, education, he, himself, had, received, at, age, nine, edward, was, sent, to, a, day, school, in, philadelphia, at, 12, he, attended, the, friends, boarding, school, at, westtown, near, west, chester, pennsylvania, the, school, was, founded, in, 1799, with, fundraising, by, members, of, the, society, of, friends, quakers, and, provided, much, of, the, cope, family, s, education, the, prestigious, school, was, expensive, costing, alfred, 500, in, tuition, each, year, and, in, his, first, year, edward, studied, algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and, latin, edward, s, letters, home, requesting, a, larger, allowance, show, he, was, able, to, manipulate, his, father, and, he, was, according, to, author, and, cope, biographer, jane, davidson, a, bit, of, a, spoiled, brat, his, letters, suggest, he, was, lonely, at, the, school, it, was, the, first, time, he, had, been, away, from, his, home, for, an, extended, period, otherwise, edward, s, studies, progressed, much, like, a, typical, boy, he, consistently, had, less, than, perfect, or, not, quite, satisfactory, marks, for, conduct, from, his, teachers, and, did, not, work, hard, on, his, penmanship, lessons, which, may, have, contributed, to, his, often, illegible, handwriting, as, an, adult, edward, returned, to, westtown, in, 1855, accompanied, by, two, of, his, sisters, biology, began, to, interest, him, more, that, year, and, he, studied, natural, history, texts, in, his, spare, time, while, at, the, school, he, frequently, visited, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, edward, often, obtained, bad, marks, due, to, quarreling, and, bad, conduct, his, letters, to, his, father, show, he, chafed, at, farm, work, and, betrayed, flashes, of, the, temper, for, which, he, would, later, become, well, known, after, sending, edward, back, to, the, farm, for, summer, break, in, 1854, and, 1855, alfred, did, not, return, edward, to, school, after, spring, 1856, instead, alfred, attempted, to, turn, his, son, into, a, gentleman, farmer, which, he, considered, a, wholesome, profession, that, would, yield, enough, profit, to, lead, a, comfortable, life, and, improve, the, undersized, edward, s, health, until, 1863, cope, s, letters, to, his, father, continually, expressed, his, yearning, for, a, more, professional, scientific, career, than, that, of, a, farmer, which, he, called, dreadfully, boring, while, working, on, farms, edward, continued, his, education, on, his, own, in, 1858, he, began, working, part, time, at, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, reclassifying, and, cataloguing, specimens, and, published, his, first, series, of, research, results, in, january, 1859, cope, began, taking, french, and, german, classes, with, a, former, westtown, teacher, though, alfred, resisted, his, son, s, pursuit, of, a, science, career, he, paid, for, his, son, s, private, studies, instead, of, working, the, farm, his, father, bought, for, him, edward, rented, out, the, land, and, used, the, income, to, further, his, scientific, endeavors, alfred, finally, gave, in, to, edward, s, wishes, and, paid, for, university, classes, cope, attended, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, the, 1861, and, or, 1862, academic, years, studying, comparative, anatomy, under, joseph, leidy, one, of, the, most, influential, anatomists, and, paleontologists, at, the, time, cope, asked, his, father, to, pay, for, a, tutor, in, german, and, french, to, allow, him, to, read, scholarly, works, in, those, languages, during, this, period, he, had, a, job, recataloging, the, herpetological, collection, at, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, where, he, became, a, member, at, leidy, s, urging, cope, visited, the, smithsonian, institution, on, occasion, where, he, became, acquainted, with, spencer, baird, who, was, an, expert, in, the, fields, of, ornithology, and, ichthyology, in, 1861, he, published, his, first, paper, on, salamandridae, classification, over, the, next, five, years, he, published, primarily, on, reptiles, and, amphibians, cope, s, membership, in, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, and, american, philosophical, society, gave, him, outlets, to, publish, and, announce, his, work, many, of, his, early, paleontological, works, were, published, by, the, philosophical, society, in, 1863, and, 1864, during, the, american, civil, war, cope, traveled, through, europe, taking, the, opportunity, to, visit, the, most, esteemed, museums, and, societies, of, the, time, initially, he, seemed, interested, in, helping, out, at, a, field, hospital, but, in, letters, to, his, father, later, on, in, the, war, this, aspiration, seemed, to, disappear, instead, he, considered, working, in, the, american, south, to, assist, freed, african, americans, davidson, suggests, cope, s, correspondence, with, leidy, and, ferdinand, hayden, who, worked, as, field, surgeons, during, the, war, might, have, informed, cope, of, the, horrors, of, the, occupation, edward, was, involved, in, a, love, affair, his, father, did, not, approve, whether, edward, or, the, unnamed, woman, whom, he, at, one, point, intended, to, marry, broke, off, the, relationship, is, unknown, but, he, took, the, breakup, poorly, biographer, and, paleontologist, henry, fairfield, osborn, attributed, edward, s, sudden, departure, for, europe, as, a, method, of, keeping, him, from, being, drafted, into, the, civil, war, cope, did, write, to, his, father, from, london, on, february, 11, 1864, i, shall, get, home, in, time, to, catch, and, be, caught, by, the, new, draft, i, shall, not, be, sorry, for, this, as, i, know, certain, persons, who, would, be, mean, enough, to, say, that, i, have, gone, to, europe, to, avoid, the, war, eventually, cope, took, the, pragmatic, approach, and, waited, out, the, conflict, he, may, have, suffered, from, mild, depression, during, this, period, and, often, complained, of, boredom, despite, his, torpor, edward, proceeded, with, his, tour, of, europe, and, met, with, some, of, the, most, highly, esteemed, scientists, of, the, world, during, his, travels, through, france, germany, great, britain, ireland, austria, italy, and, eastern, europe, most, likely, with, introductory, letters, from, leidy, and, spencer, baird, in, the, winter, of, 1863, edward, met, othniel, charles, marsh, while, in, berlin, marsh, age, 32, was, attending, the, university, of, berlin, he, held, two, university, degrees, in, comparison, to, edward, s, lack, of, formal, schooling, past, 16, but, edward, had, written, 37, scientific, papers, in, comparison, to, marsh, s, two, published, works, 11, while, they, would, later, become, rivals, the, two, men, appeared, to, take, a, liking, to, each, other, upon, meeting, marsh, led, edward, on, a, tour, of, the, city, and, they, stayed, together, for, days, after, edward, left, berlin, the, two, maintained, correspondence, exchanging, manuscripts, fossils, and, photographs, 11, edward, burned, many, of, his, journals, and, letters, from, europe, upon, his, return, to, the, united, states, friends, intervened, and, stopped, cope, from, destroying, some, of, his, drawings, and, notes, in, what, author, url, lanham, deemed, a, partial, suicide, when, cope, returned, to, philadelphia, in, 1864, his, family, made, every, effort, to, secure, him, a, teaching, post, as, the, professor, of, zoology, at, haverford, college, a, small, quaker, school, where, the, family, had, philanthropic, ties, 48, the, college, awarded, him, an, honorary, master, s, degree, so, he, could, have, the, position, cope, even, began, to, think, about, marriage, and, consulted, his, father, in, the, matter, telling, him, of, the, girl, he, would, like, to, marry, an, amiable, woman, not, over, sensitive, with, considerable, energy, and, especially, one, inclined, to, be, serious, and, not, inclined, to, frivolity, and, display, the, more, truly, christian, of, course, the, better, seems, to, be, the, most, practically, the, most, suitable, for, me, though, intellect, and, accomplishments, have, more, charm, 48, cope, thought, of, annie, pim, a, member, of, the, society, of, friends, as, less, a, lover, than, companion, declaring, her, amiability, and, domestic, qualities, generally, her, capability, of, taking, care, of, a, house, etc, as, well, as, her, steady, seriousness, weigh, far, more, with, me, than, any, of, the, traits, which, form, the, theme, of, poets, cope, s, family, approved, of, his, choice, and, the, marriage, took, place, in, july, 1865, at, pim, s, farmhouse, in, chester, county, pennsylvania, the, two, had, a, single, daughter, julia, biddle, cope, born, june, 10, 1866, cope, s, return, to, the, united, states, also, marked, an, expansion, of, his, scientific, studies, in, 1864, he, described, several, fishes, a, whale, and, the, amphibian, amphibamus, grandiceps, his, first, paleontological, contribution, during, the, period, between, 1866, and, 1867, cope, went, on, trips, to, western, parts, of, the, country, he, related, to, his, father, his, scientific, experiences, to, his, daughter, he, sent, descriptions, of, animal, life, as, part, of, her, education, cope, found, educating, his, students, at, haverford, a, pleasure, but, wrote, to, his, father, that, he, could, not, get, any, work, done, he, resigned, from, his, position, at, haverford, and, moved, his, family, to, haddonfield, in, part, to, be, closer, to, the, fossil, beds, of, western, new, jersey, due, to, the, time, consuming, nature, of, his, haverford, position, cope, had, not, had, time, to, attend, to, his, farm, and, had, let, it, out, to, others, but, eventually, found, he, was, in, need, of, more, money, to, fuel, his, scientific, habits, pleading, with, his, father, for, money, to, pursue, his, career, he, finally, sold, the, farm, in, 1869, alfred, apparently, did, not, press, his, son, to, continue, farming, and, edward, focused, on, his, scientific, career, he, continued, his, continental, travels, including, trips, to, virginia, tennessee, and, north, carolina, he, visited, caves, across, the, region, he, stopped, these, cave, explorations, after, an, 1871, trip, to, the, wyandotte, caves, in, indiana, but, remained, interested, in, the, subject, cope, had, visited, haddonfield, many, times, in, the, 1860s, paying, periodic, visits, to, the, marl, pits, the, fossils, he, found, in, these, pits, became, the, focus, of, several, papers, including, a, description, in, 1868, of, elasmosaurus, platyurus, and, laelaps, marsh, accompanied, him, on, one, of, these, excursions, cope, s, proximity, to, the, beds, after, moving, to, haddonfield, made, more, frequent, trips, possible, the, copes, lived, comfortably, in, a, frame, house, backed, by, an, apple, orchard, two, maids, tended, the, estate, which, entertained, a, number, of, guests, cope, s, only, concern, was, for, more, money, to, spend, on, his, scientific, work, the, 1870s, were, the, golden, years, of, cope, s, career, marked, by, his, most, prominent, discoveries, and, rapid, flow, of, publications, among, his, descriptions, were, the, therapsid, lystrosaurus, 1870, the, archosauromorph, champsosaurus, 1876, and, the, sauropod, amphicoelias, 1878, possibly, the, largest, dinosaur, ever, discovered, in, the, period, of, one, year, from, 1879, to, 1880, cope, published, 76, papers, based, on, his, travels, through, new, mexico, and, colorado, and, on, the, findings, of, his, collectors, in, texas, kansas, oregon, colorado, wyoming, and, utah, during, the, peak, years, cope, published, around, 25, reports, and, preliminary, observations, each, year, the, hurried, publications, led, to, errors, in, interpretation, and, naming, many, of, his, scientific, names, were, later, canceled, or, withdrawn, in, comparison, marsh, wrote, and, published, less, frequently, and, more, succinctly, his, works, appeared, in, the, widely, read, american, journal, of, science, which, led, to, faster, reception, abroad, and, marsh, s, reputation, grew, more, rapidly, than, cope, s, in, autumn, 1871, cope, began, prospecting, farther, west, to, the, fossil, fields, of, kansas, leidy, and, marsh, had, been, to, the, region, earlier, and, cope, employed, one, of, marsh, s, guides, benjamin, mudge, who, was, in, want, of, a, job, cope, s, companion, charles, sternberg, described, the, lack, of, water, and, good, food, available, to, cope, and, his, helpers, on, these, expeditions, cope, would, suffer, from, a, severe, attack, of, nightmare, in, which, every, animal, of, which, we, had, found, trace, during, the, day, played, with, him, at, night, sometimes, he, would, lose, half, the, night, in, this, exhausting, slumber, nevertheless, cope, continued, to, lead, the, party, from, sunrise, to, sunset, sending, letters, to, his, wife, and, child, describing, his, finds, the, severe, desert, conditions, and, cope, s, habit, of, overworking, himself, till, he, was, bedridden, caught, up, with, him, and, in, 1872, he, broke, down, from, exhaustion, 583, cope, maintained, a, regular, pattern, of, summers, spent, prospecting, and, winters, writing, up, his, findings, from, 1871, to, 1879, throughout, the, decade, cope, traveled, across, the, west, exploring, rocks, of, the, eocene, in, 1872, and, the, titanothere, beds, of, colorado, in, 1873, in, 1874, cope, was, employed, with, the, wheeler, survey, a, group, of, surveys, led, by, george, montague, wheeler, that, mapped, parts, of, the, united, states, west, of, the, 100th, meridian, the, survey, traveled, through, new, mexico, whose, puerco, formations, he, wrote, to, his, father, provided, the, most, important, find, in, geology, i, have, ever, made, the, new, mexico, bluffs, contained, millions, of, years, of, formation, and, subsequent, deformation, and, were, in, an, area, which, had, not, been, visited, by, leidy, or, marsh, being, part, of, the, survey, had, other, advantages, cope, was, able, to, draw, on, fort, commissaries, and, defray, publishing, costs, while, there, was, no, salary, his, findings, would, be, published, in, the, annual, reports, the, surveys, printed, cope, brought, annie, and, julia, along, on, one, such, survey, and, rented, a, house, for, them, at, fort, bridger, but, he, spent, more, of, his, own, money, on, these, survey, trips, than, he, would, have, liked, 63, alfred, died, december, 4, 1875, and, left, edward, with, an, inheritance, of, nearly, a, quarter, of, a, million, dollars, alfred, s, death, was, a, blow, to, cope, his, father, was, a, constant, confidant, the, same, year, marked, a, suspension, of, much, of, cope, s, field, work, and, a, new, emphasis, on, writing, up, discoveries, of, the, previous, years, his, chief, publication, of, the, time, the, vertebrata, of, the, cretaceous, formations, of, the, west, was, a, collection, of, 303, pages, and, 54, illustration, plates, the, memoir, summarized, his, experiences, prospecting, in, new, jersey, and, kansas, cope, now, had, the, finances, to, hire, multiple, teams, to, search, for, fossils, for, him, year, round, and, he, advised, the, philadelphia, centennial, exhibition, on, their, fossil, displays, cope, s, studies, of, marine, reptiles, of, kansas, closed, in, 1876, opening, a, new, focus, on, terrestrial, reptiles, the, same, year, cope, moved, from, haddonfield, to, 2100, and, 2102, pine, street, in, philadelphia, he, converted, one, of, the, two, houses, into, a, museum, where, he, stored, his, growing, collection, of, fossils, cope, s, expeditions, took, him, across, kansas, colorado, new, mexico, wyoming, and, montana, his, initial, journey, into, the, clarendon, beds, of, upper, miocene, and, lower, pliocene, of, texas, led, to, an, affiliation, with, the, geological, survey, of, texas, cope, s, papers, on, the, region, constitute, some, of, his, most, important, paleontological, contributions, in, 1877, he, purchased, half, the, rights, to, the, american, naturalist, to, publish, the, papers, he, produced, at, a, rate, so, high, marsh, questioned, their, dating, cope, returned, to, europe, in, august, 1878, in, response, to, an, invitation, to, join, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, s, dublin, meeting, he, was, warmly, welcomed, in, england, and, france, and, met, with, the, distinguished, paleontologists, and, archeologists, of, the, period, marsh, s, attempts, to, sully, cope, s, reputation, had, made, little, impact, on, anyone, save, paleontologist, thomas, henry, huxley, who, according, to, osborn, alone, treated, with, coolness, following, the, dublin, meeting, cope, spent, two, days, with, the, french, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, at, each, gathering, cope, exhibited, dinosaur, restorations, by, philadelphia, colleague, john, a, ryder, and, various, charts, and, plates, from, geological, surveys, of, the, 1870s, led, by, ferdinand, vandeveer, hayden, he, returned, to, london, on, october, 12, meeting, with, anatomist, richard, owen, ichthyologist, albert, g, nther, and, paleontologist, h, g, seeley, while, in, europe, cope, purchased, a, great, collection, of, fossils, from, argentina, cope, never, found, time, to, describe, the, collection, and, many, of, the, boxes, remained, unopened, until, his, death, cope, s, relations, with, marsh, turned, into, a, competition, for, fossils, between, the, two, known, today, as, the, bone, wars, the, conflict, s, seeds, began, upon, the, men, s, return, to, the, united, states, in, the, 1860s, although, cope, named, colosteus, marshii, for, marsh, in, 1867, and, marsh, returned, the, favor, naming, mosasaurus, copeanus, for, cope, in, 1869, 15, cope, introduced, his, colleague, to, the, marl, pit, owner, albert, vorhees, when, the, two, visited, the, site, marsh, went, behind, cope, s, back, and, made, a, private, agreement, with, vorhees, any, fossils, that, vorhees, s, men, found, were, sent, back, to, marsh, at, new, haven, when, marsh, was, at, haddonfield, examining, one, of, cope, s, fossil, finds, a, complete, skeleton, of, a, large, aquatic, plesiosaur, elasmosaurus, that, had, four, flippers, and, a, long, neck, he, commented, that, the, fossil, s, head, was, on, the, wrong, end, evidently, stating, that, cope, had, put, the, skull, at, the, end, of, the, vertebrae, of, the, tail, cope, was, outraged, and, the, two, argued, for, some, time, until, they, agreed, to, have, leidy, examine, the, bones, and, determine, who, was, right, leidy, came, picked, up, the, head, of, the, fossil, and, put, it, on, the, other, end, cope, was, horrified, since, he, had, already, published, a, paper, on, the, fossil, with, the, error, at, the, american, philosophical, society, he, immediately, tried, to, buy, back, the, copies, but, some, remained, with, their, buyers, marsh, and, leidy, kept, theirs, 15, the, whole, ordeal, might, have, passed, easily, enough, had, leidy, not, exposed, the, cover, up, at, the, next, society, meeting, not, to, alienate, cope, but, only, in, response, to, cope, s, brief, statement, where, he, never, admitted, he, was, wrong, cope, and, marsh, would, never, talk, to, each, other, amicably, again, and, by, 1873, open, hostility, had, broken, out, between, them, the, rivalry, between, the, two, increased, towards, the, latter, half, of, the, 1870s, in, 1877, marsh, received, a, letter, from, arthur, lakes, a, schoolteacher, in, golden, colorado, lakes, had, been, hiking, in, the, mountains, near, the, town, of, morrison, with, his, friend, h, c, beckwith, looking, for, fossilized, leaves, in, the, dakota, sandstone, instead, the, pair, found, large, bones, embedded, in, the, rock, lakes, wrote, that, the, bones, were, apparently, a, vertebra, and, a, humerus, bone, of, some, gigantic, saurian, while, lakes, sent, marsh, some, 1, 500, pounds, of, bone, he, also, sent, cope, some, of, the, specimens, marsh, published, his, finds, first, and, having, been, paid, 100, for, the, finds, lakes, wrote, to, cope, that, the, samples, should, be, forwarded, to, marsh, cope, was, offended, by, the, slight, meanwhile, cope, received, bones, from, school, superintendent, o, w, lucas, in, march, 1877, from, ca, on, city, the, remains, were, of, a, dinosaur, even, bigger, than, lakes, that, marsh, had, described, word, that, lakes, had, notified, cope, of, his, finds, galvanized, marsh, into, action, when, marsh, heard, from, union, pacific, railroad, workers, w, e, carlin, and, w, h, reed, about, a, vast, boneyard, northwest, of, laramie, in, como, bluff, marsh, sent, his, agent, samuel, wendell, williston, to, take, charge, of, the, digging, cope, in, response, learned, of, carlin, and, reed, s, discoveries, and, sent, his, own, men, to, find, bones, in, the, area, the, two, scientists, attempted, to, sabotage, each, other, s, progress, cope, was, described, as, a, genius, and, what, marsh, lacked, in, intelligence, he, easily, made, up, for, in, connections, marsh, s, uncle, was, george, peabody, a, rich, banker, who, supported, marsh, with, money, and, a, secure, position, at, the, peabody, museum, marsh, lobbied, john, wesley, powell, to, act, against, cope, and, attempted, to, persuade, hayden, to, muzzle, cope, s, publishing, 106, both, men, tried, to, spy, on, the, other, s, whereabouts, and, attempted, to, offer, their, collectors, more, money, in, the, hopes, of, recruiting, them, to, their, own, side, cope, was, able, to, recruit, david, baldwin, in, new, mexico, and, frank, williston, in, wyoming, from, marsh, 257, cope, and, marsh, were, extremely, secretive, as, to, the, source, of, their, fossils, when, henry, fairfield, osborn, at, the, time, a, student, at, princeton, visited, cope, to, ask, where, to, travel, to, look, for, fossils, in, the, west, cope, politely, refused, to, answer, when, cope, arrived, back, in, the, united, states, after, his, tour, of, europe, in, 1878, he, had, nearly, two, years, of, fossil, findings, from, lucas, among, these, dinosaurs, was, camarasaurus, one, of, the, most, recognizable, dinosaur, recreations, of, the, time, the, summer, of, 1879, took, cope, to, salt, lake, city, san, francisco, and, north, to, oregon, where, he, was, amazed, at, the, rich, flora, and, the, blueness, of, the, pacific, ocean, in, 1879, the, united, states, congress, consolidated, the, various, government, survey, teams, into, the, united, states, geological, survey, with, clarence, king, as, its, leader, this, was, discouraging, to, cope, because, king, named, marsh, an, old, college, friend, as, the, chief, paleontologist, the, period, of, cope, s, and, marsh, s, paleontological, digs, in, the, american, west, spanned, from, 1877, to, 1892, by, which, time, both, men, exhausted, much, of, their, financial, resources, the, 1880s, proved, disastrous, for, cope, marsh, s, close, association, with, the, geological, survey, gave, him, the, resources, to, employ, 54, staff, members, over, the, course, of, ten, years, his, teaching, position, at, yale, meant, he, had, guaranteed, access, to, the, american, journal, of, science, for, publication, cope, had, his, interest, in, the, naturalist, but, it, drained, him, of, funds, after, hayden, was, removed, from, the, survey, cope, lost, his, source, of, government, funding, his, fortune, was, not, enough, to, support, his, rivalry, so, cope, invested, in, mining, most, of, his, properties, were, silver, mines, in, new, mexico, one, mine, yielded, an, ore, vein, worth, 3, million, in, silver, chloride, cope, visited, the, mines, each, summer, from, 1881, to, 1885, taking, the, opportunity, to, supervise, or, collect, other, minerals, for, a, while, he, made, good, money, but, the, mines, stopped, producing, and, by, 1886, he, had, to, give, up, his, now, worthless, stocks, the, same, year, he, received, a, teaching, position, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, he, continued, to, travel, west, but, realized, he, would, not, be, able, to, best, marsh, in, cornering, the, market, for, bones, he, had, to, release, the, collectors, he, had, hired, and, sell, his, collections, during, this, period, he, published, 40, to, 75, papers, each, year, with, the, failure, of, his, mines, cope, began, searching, for, a, job, but, was, turned, down, at, the, smithsonian, and, american, museum, of, natural, history, he, turned, to, giving, lectures, for, hire, and, writing, magazine, articles, each, year, he, lobbied, congress, for, an, appropriation, with, which, to, finish, his, work, on, cope, s, bible, a, volume, on, tertiary, vertebrates, but, was, continually, turned, down, rather, than, work, with, powell, and, the, survey, cope, tried, to, inflame, sentiment, against, them, at, marsh, s, urging, powell, pushed, for, cope, to, return, specimens, he, had, unearthed, during, his, employment, under, the, government, surveys, this, was, an, outrage, to, cope, who, had, used, his, own, money, while, working, as, a, volunteer, in, response, cope, went, to, the, editor, of, the, new, york, herald, and, promised, a, scandalous, headline, since, 1885, cope, had, kept, an, elaborate, journal, of, mistakes, and, misdeeds, that, both, marsh, and, powell, had, committed, over, the, years, from, scientific, errors, to, publishing, mistakes, he, had, them, written, down, in, a, journal, he, kept, in, the, bottom, drawer, of, his, pine, street, desk, cope, sought, out, marsh, s, assistants, who, complained, of, being, denied, access, and, credit, by, their, employer, and, of, being, chronically, underpaid, reporter, william, hosea, ballou, ran, the, first, article, on, january, 12, 1890, in, what, would, become, a, series, of, newspaper, debates, between, marsh, powell, and, cope, cope, attacked, marsh, for, plagiarism, and, financial, mismanagement, and, attacked, powell, for, his, geological, classification, errors, and, misspending, of, government, allocated, funds, marsh, and, powell, published, their, own, side, of, the, story, and, in, the, end, little, changed, no, congressional, hearing, was, created, to, investigate, powell, s, alleged, misallocation, of, funds, while, cope, and, marsh, were, not, held, responsible, for, any, mistakes, indirectly, however, the, attacks, may, have, been, influential, in, marsh, s, fall, from, power, in, the, survey, due, to, pressure, from, powell, over, bad, press, marsh, was, removed, from, his, position, for, the, government, surveys, cope, s, relations, with, the, president, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, soured, and, the, entire, funding, for, paleontology, in, the, government, surveys, was, pulled, 329, 334, cope, took, his, sinking, fortunes, in, stride, in, writing, to, osborn, about, the, articles, he, laughed, at, the, outcome, saying, it, will, now, rest, largely, with, you, whether, or, not, i, am, supposed, to, be, a, liar, and, am, actuated, by, jealousy, and, disappointment, i, think, marsh, is, impaled, on, the, horns, of, monoclonius, sphenocerus, cope, was, well, aware, of, his, enemies, and, was, carefree, enough, to, name, a, species, after, a, combination, of, cope, and, hater, anisonchus, cophater, through, his, years, of, financial, hardship, he, was, able, to, continue, publishing, papers, his, most, productive, years, were, 1884, and, 1885, with, 79, and, 62, papers, published, respectively, the, 1880s, marked, the, publication, of, two, of, the, best, known, fossil, taxa, described, by, cope, the, pelycosaur, edaphosaurus, in, 1882, and, the, early, dinosaur, coelophysis, in, 1889, in, 1889, he, succeeded, leidy, who, had, died, the, previous, year, as, professor, of, zoology, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, 349, the, small, yearly, stipend, was, enough, for, cope, s, family, to, move, back, into, one, of, the, townhouses, he, had, been, forced, to, relinquish, earlier, in, 1892, cope, then, 52, years, old, was, granted, expense, money, for, field, work, from, the, texas, geological, survey, with, his, finances, improved, he, was, able, to, publish, a, massive, work, on, the, batrachians, of, north, america, which, was, the, most, detailed, analysis, and, organization, of, the, continent, s, frogs, and, amphibians, ever, mastered, 350, and, the, 1, 115, page, the, crocodilians, lizards, and, snakes, of, north, america, in, the, 1890s, his, publication, rate, increased, to, an, average, of, 43, articles, a, year, 350, his, final, expedition, to, the, west, took, place, in, 1894, when, he, prospected, for, dinosaurs, in, south, dakota, and, visited, sites, in, texas, and, oklahoma, the, same, year, julia, was, married, to, william, h, collins, a, haverford, astronomy, professor, the, couple, s, ages, julia, was, 28, and, the, groom, 35, were, past, the, conventions, of, victorian, marriage, after, their, european, honeymoon, the, couple, returned, to, haverford, while, annie, moved, to, haverford, as, well, cope, did, not, his, official, reason, was, the, long, commute, and, late, lectures, he, gave, in, philadelphia, in, private, correspondence, however, osborn, wrote, that, the, two, had, essentially, separated, 355, though, they, remained, on, amiable, terms, 356, 357, cope, sold, his, collections, to, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1895, his, set, of, 10, 000, american, fossil, mammals, sold, for, 32, 000, lower, than, cope, s, asking, price, of, 50, 000, the, purchase, was, financed, by, the, donations, from, new, york, s, high, society, 356, 357, cope, sold, three, other, collections, for, 29, 000, while, his, collection, contained, more, than, 13, 000, specimens, cope, s, fossil, hoard, was, still, much, smaller, than, marsh, s, collection, valued, at, over, a, million, dollars, the, university, of, pennsylvania, bought, part, of, cope, s, ethnological, artifact, collection, for, 5, 500, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, philadelphia, s, foremost, museum, did, not, bid, on, any, of, cope, s, sales, due, to, bad, blood, between, cope, and, the, museum, s, leaders, as, a, result, many, of, cope, s, major, finds, left, the, city, 356, 357, cope, s, proceeds, from, the, sales, allowed, him, to, rehire, sternberg, to, prospect, for, fossils, on, his, behalf, 358, in, 1896, cope, began, suffering, from, a, gastrointestinal, illness, he, said, was, cystitis, 359, his, wife, cared, for, him, in, philadelphia, when, she, was, able, at, other, times, cope, s, university, secretary, anna, brown, tended, to, him, cope, at, this, time, lived, in, his, pine, street, museum, and, rested, on, a, cot, surrounded, by, his, fossil, finds, cope, often, prescribed, himself, medications, including, large, amounts, of, morphine, belladonna, and, formalin, a, substance, based, on, formaldehyde, used, to, preserve, specimens, osborn, was, horrified, by, cope, s, actions, and, made, arrangements, for, surgery, but, the, plans, were, put, on, hold, after, a, temporary, improvement, in, cope, s, health, cope, went, to, virginia, looking, for, fossils, became, ill, again, and, returned, to, his, home, very, weak, osborn, visited, cope, on, april, 5, inquiring, about, cope, s, health, but, the, sick, paleontologist, pressed, his, friend, for, his, views, on, the, origin, of, mammals, word, of, cope, s, illness, spread, and, he, was, visited, by, friends, and, colleagues, even, in, a, feverish, condition, cope, delivered, lectures, from, his, bed, cope, died, on, april, 12, 1897, 16, weeks, short, of, his, 57th, birthday, 361, sternberg, still, prospecting, for, cope, that, spring, was, woken, by, a, liveryman, who, relayed, word, from, annie, that, cope, had, died, three, days, earlier, sternberg, wrote, in, his, memoirs, i, had, lost, friends, before, and, i, had, known, what, it, was, to, bury, my, own, dead, even, my, firstborn, son, but, i, had, never, sorrowed, more, deeply, than, i, did, over, the, news, 361, cope, s, quaker, funeral, consisted, of, six, men, osborn, his, colleague, william, berryman, scott, cope, s, friend, persifor, frazer, son, in, law, collins, horatio, wood, and, harrison, allen, the, six, sat, around, cope, s, coffin, among, the, fossils, and, cope, s, pets, a, tortoise, and, a, gila, monster, for, what, osborn, called, a, perfect, quaker, silence, an, interminable, length, of, time, 361, anticipating, the, quiet, osborn, had, brought, along, a, bible, and, read, an, excerpt, from, the, book, of, job, ending, by, saying, these, are, the, problems, to, which, our, friend, devoted, his, life, 362, the, coffin, was, loaded, on, a, hearse, and, carried, to, a, gathering, at, fairfield, much, of, the, gathering, was, spent, in, silence, after, the, coffin, was, removed, the, assembled, began, talking, frazer, recalled, that, each, person, remembered, cope, differently, and, few, men, succeeded, so, well, in, concealing, from, anyone, all, the, sides, of, his, multiform, character, 362, osborn, intending, to, follow, the, coffin, to, the, graveyard, was, instead, pulled, aside, by, collins, and, taken, to, the, reading, of, cope, s, will, osborn, and, cope, s, brother, in, law, john, garrett, were, named, executors, cope, gave, his, family, a, choice, of, his, books, with, the, remainder, to, be, sold, or, donated, to, the, university, of, pennsylvania, after, debts, were, handled, cope, left, small, bequests, to, friends, and, family, anna, brown, and, julia, received, 5000, each, while, the, remainder, went, to, annie, cope, s, estate, was, valued, at, 75, 327, not, including, additional, revenue, raised, by, sales, of, fossils, to, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, for, a, total, of, 84, 600, 363, some, specimens, preserved, in, alcohol, made, their, way, to, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, including, a, few, gordian, worms, cope, insisted, through, his, will, that, no, graveside, service, or, burial, be, held, he, had, donated, his, body, to, science, he, issued, a, final, challenge, to, marsh, at, his, death, he, had, his, skull, donated, to, science, so, his, brain, could, be, measured, hoping, his, brain, would, be, larger, than, that, of, his, adversary, at, the, time, brain, size, was, thought, to, be, the, true, measure, of, intelligence, marsh, never, accepted, the, challenge, osborn, listed, cope, s, cause, of, death, as, uremic, poisoning, combined, with, a, large, prostate, but, the, true, cause, of, death, is, unknown, 361, many, believed, cope, had, died, of, syphilis, contracted, from, the, women, with, whom, he, fraternized, during, his, travels, in, 1995, davidson, gained, permission, to, have, the, skeleton, examined, by, a, medical, doctor, at, the, university, dr, morrie, kricun, a, professor, of, radiology, concluded, no, evidence, of, bony, syphilis, was, found, on, cope, s, skeleton, public, mentions, of, cope, s, death, were, relatively, slight, the, naturalist, ran, four, photographs, a, six, page, obituary, by, editor, j, s, kingsley, and, a, two, page, remembrance, by, frazer, the, national, academy, of, sciences, official, memoir, was, submitted, years, later, and, written, by, osborn, the, american, journal, of, science, devoted, six, paragraphs, to, cope, s, passing, and, incorrectly, gave, his, age, as, 46, cope, was, outlived, by, his, rival, marsh, who, was, suffering, poor, health, 366, julia, assisted, osborn, in, writing, a, biography, of, her, father, titled, cope, master, naturalist, she, would, not, comment, on, the, name, of, the, woman, with, whom, her, father, had, had, an, affair, prior, to, his, first, european, travel, julia, is, believed, to, have, burned, any, of, the, scandalous, letters, and, journals, cope, had, kept, but, many, of, his, friends, were, able, to, give, their, recollections, of, the, scandalous, nature, of, some, of, cope, s, unpublished, routines, charles, r, knight, a, former, friend, called, cope, s, mouth, the, filthiest, from, hearsay, that, in, heyday, no, woman, was, safe, within, five, miles, of, him, as, julia, was, the, major, financier, behind, the, master, naturalist, she, wanted, to, keep, her, father, s, name, in, good, standing, and, refused, to, comment, on, any, misdeeds, her, father, might, have, committed, cope, was, described, by, zoologist, henry, weed, fowler, as, a, man, of, medium, height, and, build, but, always, impressive, with, his, great, energy, and, activity, to, him, fowler, wrote, was, both, genial, and, always, interesting, easily, approachable, and, both, kindly, and, helpful, cope, s, affability, during, visits, to, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, to, compare, specimens, was, later, recalled, by, his, colleague, witmer, stone, i, have, often, seen, him, busily, engaged, in, such, comparisons, all, the, while, whistling, whole, passages, from, grand, opera, or, else, counting, the, scales, on, the, back, of, a, lizard, while, he, conversed, in, a, most, amusing, manner, with, some, small, street, urchin, who, had, drifted, into, the, museum, and, was, watching, in, awe, with, eyes, and, mouth, wide, open, his, self, taught, nature, however, meant, that, he, was, largely, hostile, to, bureaucracy, and, politics, he, had, a, famous, temper, one, friend, called, cope, a, militant, paleontologist, despite, his, faults, he, was, generally, well, liked, by, his, contemporaries, american, paleontologist, alfred, romer, wrote, that, little, slips, from, virtue, were, those, we, might, make, ourselves, were, we, bolder, cope, was, raised, as, a, quaker, and, was, taught, that, the, bible, was, literal, truth, although, he, never, confronted, his, family, about, their, religious, views, osborn, writes, that, cope, was, at, least, aware, of, the, conflict, between, his, scientific, career, and, his, religion, osborn, writes, if, edward, harbored, intellectual, doubts, about, the, literalness, of, the, bible, he, did, not, express, them, in, his, letters, to, his, family, but, there, can, be, little, question, that, he, shared, the, intellectual, unrest, of, the, period, lanham, writes, that, cope, s, religious, fervor, which, seems, to, have, subsided, after, his, father, s, death, was, embarrassing, to, even, his, devout, quaker, associates, biographer, jane, davidson, believes, that, osborn, overstated, cope, s, internal, religious, conflicts, she, ascribes, cope, s, deference, to, his, father, s, beliefs, as, an, act, of, respect, or, a, measure, to, retain, his, father, s, financial, support, frazer, s, reminiscences, about, his, friend, suggest, cope, often, told, people, what, they, wanted, to, hear, rather, than, his, true, views, as, a, young, man, cope, read, charles, darwin, s, voyage, of, a, naturalist, which, had, little, effect, on, him, the, only, comment, about, darwin, s, book, recorded, by, cope, was, that, darwin, discussed, too, much, geology, from, the, account, of, his, voyage, due, to, his, background, in, taxonomy, and, paleontology, cope, focused, on, evolution, in, terms, of, changing, structure, rather, than, emphasizing, geography, and, variation, within, populations, as, darwin, had, over, his, lifetime, cope, s, views, on, evolution, shifted, his, early, views, held, that, while, darwin, s, natural, selection, may, affect, the, preservation, of, superficial, characteristics, in, organisms, natural, selection, alone, could, not, explain, the, formation, of, genera, cope, s, suggested, mechanism, for, this, action, was, a, steady, progressive, development, of, organization, through, what, cope, termed, a, continual, crowding, backward, of, the, successive, steps, of, individual, development, his, beliefs, later, evolved, to, one, with, an, increased, emphasis, on, continual, and, utilitarian, evolution, with, less, involvement, of, a, creator, he, became, one, of, the, founders, of, the, neo, lamarckism, school, of, thought, which, holds, that, an, individual, can, pass, on, traits, acquired, in, its, lifetime, to, offspring, although, the, view, has, been, shown, incorrect, it, was, the, prevalent, theory, among, paleontologists, in, cope, s, time, in, 1887, cope, published, his, own, origin, of, the, fittest, essays, in, evolution, detailing, his, views, on, the, subject, he, was, a, strong, believer, in, the, law, of, use, and, disuse, that, an, individual, will, slowly, over, time, favor, an, anatomical, part, of, its, body, so, much, that, it, will, become, stronger, and, larger, as, time, progresses, down, the, generations, the, giraffe, for, example, stretched, its, neck, to, reach, taller, trees, and, passed, this, acquired, characteristic, to, its, offspring, in, a, developmental, phase, that, is, added, to, gestation, in, the, womb, cope, s, theology, of, evolution, 1887, argued, that, consciousness, comes, from, the, mind, of, the, universe, and, governs, evolution, by, directing, animals, to, new, goals, according, to, sideris, 2003, argued, that, organisms, respond, to, changes, in, their, environments, by, an, exercise, of, choice, consciousness, itself, he, maintained, was, the, principal, force, in, evolution, cope, credited, god, with, having, built, into, evolution, a, life, force, that, propelled, organisms, toward, even, higher, levels, of, consciousness, cope, s, views, on, human, races, and, sex, were, influenced, by, his, lamarckian, beliefs, which, posited, those, of, european, ancestry, as, more, highly, evolved, than, nonwhite, groups, in, his, essays, on, evolution, he, assessed, the, physiognomies, of, three, sub, species, of, human, termed, the, negro, the, mongolian, and, the, indo, european, in, comparison, to, those, of, apes, and, human, embryos, and, drew, the, following, conclusion, the, indo, european, race, is, then, the, highest, by, virtue, of, the, acceleration, of, growth, in, the, development, of, the, muscles, by, which, the, body, is, maintained, in, the, erect, position, extensors, of, the, leg, and, in, those, important, elements, of, beauty, a, well, developed, nose, and, beard, it, is, also, superior, in, those, points, in, which, it, is, more, embryonic, than, the, other, races, viz, the, want, of, prominence, of, the, jaws, and, cheek, bones, since, these, are, associated, with, a, greater, predominance, of, the, cerebral, part, of, the, skull, increased, size, of, cerebral, hemispheres, and, greater, intellectual, power, he, believed, that, if, a, race, was, not, white, then, it, was, inherently, more, ape, like, he, was, opposed, to, blacks, because, of, their, degrading, vices, believing, that, the, inferior, negro, should, go, back, to, africa, and, that, their, poor, virtue, was, inherent, cope, was, against, the, modern, view, of, women, s, rights, believing, in, the, husband, s, role, as, protector, he, was, opposed, to, women, s, suffrage, as, he, felt, they, would, be, unduly, influenced, by, their, husbands, and, that, it, would, lead, to, the, retrogression, of, the, race, as, women, took, on, more, masculine, attributes, in, fewer, than, 40, years, as,
