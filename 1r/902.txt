maudgaly, yana, pali, moggall, na, also, known, as, mah, maudgaly, yana, or, by, his, birth, name, kolita, was, one, of, the, buddha, s, closest, disciples, described, as, a, contemporary, of, disciples, such, as, subhuti, riputra, pali, s, riputta, and, mah, k, yapa, pali, mah, kassapa, he, is, considered, the, second, of, the, buddha, s, two, foremost, male, disciples, together, with, riputra, traditional, accounts, relate, that, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, become, spiritual, wanderers, in, their, youth, after, having, searched, for, spiritual, truth, for, a, while, they, come, into, contact, with, the, buddhist, teaching, through, verses, that, have, become, widely, known, in, the, buddhist, world, eventually, they, meet, the, buddha, himself, and, ordain, as, monks, under, him, maudgaly, yana, attains, enlightenment, shortly, after, that, maudgalyayana, and, riputra, have, a, deep, spiritual, friendship, they, are, depicted, in, buddhist, art, as, the, two, disciples, that, accompany, the, buddha, and, they, have, complementing, roles, as, teachers, as, a, teacher, maudgalyayana, is, known, for, his, psychic, powers, and, he, is, often, depicted, using, these, in, his, teaching, methods, in, many, early, buddhist, canons, maudgaly, yana, is, instrumental, in, re, uniting, the, monastic, community, after, devadatta, causes, a, schism, furthermore, maudgaly, yana, is, connected, with, accounts, about, the, making, of, the, first, buddha, image, maudgaly, yana, dies, at, the, age, of, eighty, four, killed, through, the, efforts, of, a, rival, sect, this, violent, death, is, described, in, buddhist, scriptures, as, a, result, of, maudgaly, yana, s, karma, of, having, killed, his, own, parents, in, a, previous, life, through, post, canonical, texts, maudgaly, yana, became, known, for, his, filial, piety, through, a, popular, account, of, him, transferring, his, merits, to, his, mother, this, led, to, a, tradition, in, many, buddhist, countries, known, as, the, ghost, festival, during, which, people, dedicate, their, merits, to, their, ancestors, maudgaly, yana, has, also, traditionally, been, associated, with, meditation, and, sometimes, abhidharma, texts, as, well, as, the, dharmaguptaka, school, in, the, nineteenth, century, relics, were, found, attributed, to, him, which, have, been, widely, venerated, his, female, counterpart, was, utpalavar, pali, uppalava, in, the, pali, canon, it, is, described, that, maudgaly, yana, had, a, skin, color, like, a, blue, lotus, or, a, rain, cloud, oral, tradition, in, sri, lanka, says, that, this, was, because, he, was, born, in, hell, in, many, lifetimes, see, death, sri, lankan, scholar, karaluvinna, believes, that, originally, a, dark, skin, was, meant, not, blue, in, the, mah, s, ghika, canon, it, is, stated, that, he, was, beautiful, to, look, at, pleasant, wise, intelligent, full, of, merits, as, translated, by, migot, in, some, chinese, accounts, the, clan, name, maudgaly, yana, is, explained, as, referring, to, a, legume, which, was, eaten, by, an, ancestor, of, the, clan, however, the, indologist, ernst, windisch, linked, the, figure, of, maudgalyayana, to, the, figure, of, maudgalya, mugdala, who, appears, in, the, sanskrit, epic, mahabharata, which, would, explain, the, name, windisch, believed, the, account, of, the, diviner, maudgalya, had, influenced, that, of, maudgalyayana, since, both, relate, to, a, journey, to, heaven, author, edward, j, thomas, considered, this, improbable, though, windisch, did, consider, maudgaly, yana, a, historical, person, according, to, buddhist, texts, maudgaly, yana, is, born, in, a, family, of, the, village, kolita, also, known, as, kulika, earlier, thought, to, be, modern, day, kul, in, silao, but, now, identified, as, juafardih, near, nalanda, after, which, he, is, named, his, mother, is, mogall, ni, and, his, father, is, the, village, chief, kolita, is, born, on, the, same, day, as, upati, ya, pali, upatissa, later, to, be, known, as, riputra, and, the, two, are, friends, from, childhood, kolita, and, upati, ya, develop, an, interest, in, the, spiritual, life, when, they, are, young, one, day, while, they, are, watching, a, festival, a, sense, of, disenchantment, and, spiritual, urgency, overcomes, them, they, wish, to, leave, the, worldly, life, behind, and, start, their, spiritual, life, under, the, mendicant, wanderer, sa, jaya, vairatiputra, pali, sa, jaya, belatthiputta, in, the, therav, da, and, mah, s, ghika, canons, sa, jaya, is, described, as, a, teacher, in, the, indian, sceptic, tradition, as, he, does, not, believe, in, knowledge, or, logic, nor, does, he, answer, speculative, questions, since, he, cannot, satisfy, kolita, and, upati, ya, s, spiritual, needs, they, leave, in, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, canon, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, and, in, tibetan, accounts, however, he, is, depicted, as, a, teacher, with, admirable, qualities, such, as, meditative, vision, and, religious, zeal, he, falls, ill, though, and, dies, causing, the, two, disciples, to, look, further, in, some, accounts, he, even, goes, so, far, to, predict, the, coming, of, the, buddha, through, his, visions, regardless, kolita, and, upati, ya, leave, and, continue, their, spiritual, search, splitting, up, in, separate, directions, they, make, an, agreement, that, the, first, to, find, the, ambrosia, of, the, spiritual, life, will, tell, the, other, what, follows, is, the, account, leading, to, kolita, and, upati, ya, taking, refuge, under, the, buddha, which, is, considered, an, ancient, element, of, the, textual, tradition, upati, ya, meets, a, buddhist, monk, named, a, vajit, pali, assaji, one, of, the, first, five, disciples, of, the, buddha, who, is, walking, to, receive, alms, from, devotees, in, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, version, the, buddha, has, sent, him, there, to, teach, upati, ya, a, vajit, s, serene, deportment, inspires, upati, ya, to, approach, him, and, learn, more, a, vajit, tells, him, he, is, still, newly, ordained, and, can, only, teach, a, little, he, then, expresses, the, essence, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, in, these, words, of, all, phenomena, sprung, from, a, cause, the, teacher, the, cause, hath, told, and, he, tells, too, how, each, shall, come, to, its, end, for, such, is, the, word, of, the, sage, these, words, help, upati, ya, to, attain, the, first, stage, on, the, buddhist, spiritual, path, after, this, upati, ya, tells, kolita, about, his, discovery, and, kolita, also, attains, the, first, stage, the, two, disciples, together, with, sa, jaya, s, five, hundred, students, go, to, ordain, as, monks, under, the, buddha, in, ve, uvana, pali, ve, uvana, from, the, time, of, their, ordination, upati, ya, and, kolita, become, known, as, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, respectively, maudgaly, yana, being, the, name, of, kolita, s, clan, after, having, ordained, all, except, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, attain, arhat, pali, arahant, last, stage, of, enlightenment, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, attain, enlightenment, one, to, two, weeks, later, maudgaly, yana, in, magadha, in, a, village, called, kallavala, at, that, time, drowsiness, is, obstructing, him, from, attaining, further, progress, on, the, path, after, he, has, a, vision, of, the, buddha, advising, him, how, to, overcome, it, he, has, a, breakthrough, and, attains, enlightenment, in, some, accounts, it, is, said, that, he, meditates, on, the, elements, in, the, process, in, the, commentary, to, the, pali, dhammapada, the, question, is, asked, why, the, two, disciples, attain, enlightenment, more, slowly, than, the, other, former, students, of, sa, jaya, the, answer, given, is, that, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, are, like, kings, who, require, a, longer, time, to, prepare, for, a, journey, than, commoners, in, other, words, their, attainment, is, of, greater, depth, than, the, other, students, and, therefore, requires, more, time, a, vajit, s, brief, statement, known, as, the, ye, dharma, hetu, stanza, of, all, phenomena, has, traditionally, been, described, as, the, essence, of, the, buddhist, teaching, and, is, the, most, inscribed, verse, throughout, the, buddhist, world, it, can, be, found, in, all, buddhist, schools, is, engraved, in, many, materials, can, be, found, on, many, buddha, statues, and, st, pas, structures, with, relics, and, is, used, in, their, consecration, rituals, according, to, indologist, oldenberg, and, translator, thanissaro, bhikkhu, the, verses, were, recommended, in, one, of, emperor, asoka, s, edicts, as, subject, of, study, and, reflection, the, role, of, the, stanza, is, not, completely, understood, by, scholars, apart, from, the, complex, nature, of, the, statement, it, has, also, been, noted, it, has, not, anywhere, been, attributed, to, the, buddha, in, this, form, which, indicates, it, was, a, vajit, s, own, summary, or, paraphrasing, indologist, t, w, rhys, davids, believed, the, brief, poem, may, have, made, a, special, impression, on, maudgaly, yana, and, sariputta, because, of, the, emphasis, on, causation, typical, for, buddhism, philosopher, paul, carus, explained, that, the, stanza, was, a, bold, and, iconoclastic, response, to, brahmanic, traditions, as, it, repudiates, miracles, of, supernatural, interference, by, unreservedly, recognising, the, law, of, cause, and, effect, as, irrefragable, whereas, japanese, zen, teacher, suzuki, was, reminded, of, the, experience, that, is, beyond, the, intellect, in, which, one, idea, follows, another, in, sequence, finally, to, terminate, in, conclusion, or, judgment, although, in, the, pali, tradition, maudgaly, yana, is, described, as, an, arhat, who, will, no, longer, be, reborn, again, in, the, mahay, na, traditions, this, is, sometimes, interpreted, differently, in, the, lotus, sutra, chapter, 6, bestowal, of, prophecy, the, buddha, is, said, to, predict, that, the, disciples, mah, kasyapa, subhuti, mahakatyayana, and, maudgaly, yana, will, become, buddhas, in, the, future, on, the, day, of, maudgaly, yana, s, ordination, the, buddha, allows, him, and, riputra, to, take, the, seats, of, the, chief, male, disciples, according, to, the, pali, buddhava, sa, text, each, buddha, has, had, such, a, pair, of, chief, disciples, as, they, have, just, ordained, some, other, monks, feel, offended, that, the, buddha, gives, such, honor, to, them, the, buddha, responds, by, pointing, out, that, seniority, in, the, monkhood, is, not, the, only, criterion, in, such, an, appointment, and, explains, his, decision, further, by, relating, a, story, from, the, past, he, says, that, both, disciples, aspired, many, lifetimes, ago, to, become, chief, disciples, under, him, they, made, such, a, resolution, since, the, age, of, the, previous, buddha, a, omadass, when, maudgaly, yana, was, a, layman, called, sirivadha, sirivaddha, felt, inspired, to, become, a, chief, disciple, under, a, future, buddha, after, his, friend, riputra, in, a, previous, life, recommended, that, he, do, so, he, then, invited, buddha, a, omadass, and, the, monastic, community, sa, gha, to, have, food, at, his, house, for, seven, days, during, which, he, made, his, resolution, to, become, a, chief, disciple, for, the, first, time, afterwards, he, and, riputra, continued, to, do, good, deeds, for, many, lifetimes, until, the, time, of, sakyamuni, buddha, after, the, buddha, appoints, maudgaly, yana, as, chief, disciple, he, becomes, known, as, mah, maudgaly, yana, mah, meaning, great, this, epithet, is, given, to, him, as, an, honor, and, to, distinguish, him, from, others, of, the, same, name, post, canonical, texts, describe, maudgaly, yana, as, the, second, chief, male, disciple, next, to, riputra, the, early, canons, agree, that, riputra, is, spiritually, superior, to, maudgaly, yana, and, their, specializations, are, described, as, psychic, powers, sanskrit, ddhi, pali, iddhi, for, maudgaly, yana, and, wisdom, for, riputra, in, buddhist, art, en, literature, buddhas, are, commonly, depicted, with, two, main, disciples, japanese, niky, ji, classical, tibetan, mchog, zung, at, their, side, in, the, case, of, sakyamuni, buddha, the, two, disciples, depicted, are, most, often, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, although, there, are, different, perspectives, among, different, buddhist, canons, as, to, the, merits, of, each, disciple, in, all, buddhist, canons, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, are, recognized, as, the, two, main, disciples, of, the, buddha, this, fact, is, also, confirmed, by, iconography, as, discovered, in, archaeological, findings, in, which, the, two, disciples, tend, to, be, pictured, attending, their, master, moreover, maudgaly, yana, is, often, included, in, traditional, lists, of, four, great, disciples, pinyin, sida, shengwen, and, eight, arhats, despite, these, widespread, patterns, in, both, scripture, and, archaeological, research, it, has, been, noted, that, in, later, iconography, nanda, and, mah, kasyapa, are, depicted, much, more, and, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, are, depicted, much, less, the, lives, of, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, are, closely, connected, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, are, born, on, the, same, day, and, die, in, the, same, period, their, families, have, long, been, friends, in, their, student, years, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, are, co, pupils, under, the, same, teacher, after, having, helped, each, other, to, find, the, essence, of, the, spiritual, life, their, friendship, remains, in, many, sutras, they, show, high, appreciation, and, kindness, to, one, another, for, example, when, riputra, falls, ill, it, is, described, that, maudgaly, yana, used, his, psychic, powers, to, obtain, medicine, for, riputra, riputra, is, considered, the, wisest, disciple, of, the, buddha, but, maudgaly, yana, is, second, to, him, in, wisdom, the, one, thing, that, gives, them, a, strong, bond, as, spiritual, friends, is, the, love, for, the, buddha, which, both, express, often, several, teachings, in, the, pali, canon, are, traditionally, ascribed, to, maudgaly, yana, including, several, verses, in, the, theragatha, and, many, sutras, in, the, samyutta, nikaya, besides, these, there, are, many, passages, that, describe, events, in, his, life, he, is, seen, as, learned, and, wise, in, ethics, philosophy, and, meditation, when, comparing, riputra, with, maudgaly, yana, the, buddha, uses, the, metaphor, of, a, woman, giving, birth, to, a, child, for, riputra, in, that, he, establishes, new, students, in, the, first, attainment, on, the, spiritual, path, pali, sot, panna, maudgaly, yana, however, is, compared, with, the, master, who, trains, the, child, up, in, that, he, develops, his, students, further, along, the, path, to, enlightenment, the, buddha, is, described, in, the, texts, as, placing, great, faith, in, maudgaly, yana, as, a, teacher, he, often, praises, maudgaly, yana, for, his, teachings, and, sometimes, has, maudgaly, yana, teach, in, his, place, maudgaly, yana, is, also, given, the, responsibility, to, train, rahula, the, buddha, s, son, on, another, occasion, the, buddha, has, maudgaly, yana, announce, a, ban, on, a, group, of, monks, living, in, kitigara, whose, problematic, behavior, has, become, widely, known, in, the, area, furthermore, maudgaly, yana, plays, a, crucial, role, during, the, schism, caused, by, the, disciple, devadatta, through, his, ability, to, communicate, with, devas, god, like, beings, he, learns, that, devadatta, was, acting, inappropriately, he, obtains, information, that, devadatta, is, enjoining, prince, aj, tasattu, pali, aj, tasattu, for, help, and, the, two, form, a, dangerous, combination, maudgaly, yana, therefore, informs, the, buddha, of, this, later, when, devadatta, has, successfully, created, a, split, in, the, buddhist, community, the, buddha, asks, maudgaly, yana, and, riputra, to, convince, devadatta, s, following, to, reunite, with, the, buddha, which, in, the, pali, account, they, are, able, to, accomplish, because, devadatta, believes, they, come, to, join, his, following, he, lets, his, guard, down, they, then, persuade, the, other, monks, to, return, while, devadatta, is, asleep, after, the, split, off, party, has, successfully, been, returned, to, the, buddha, maudgaly, yana, expresses, astonishment, because, of, devadatta, s, actions, the, buddha, explains, that, devadatta, had, acted, like, this, habitually, throughout, many, lifetimes, in, the, vinaya, texts, of, some, canons, the, effort, at, persuading, the, split, off, monks, is, met, with, obstinacy, and, fails, french, buddhologist, andr, bareau, believes, this, latter, version, of, the, account, to, be, historically, authentic, which, he, further, supports, by, the, report, of, the, chinese, pilgrim, xuan, zang, twelve, centuries, later, that, devadatta, s, sect, had, still, continued, to, exist, in, the, a, guttara, nik, ya, maudgaly, yana, is, called, foremost, in, psychic, powers, a, title, he, shares, with, his, female, counterpart, utpalavar, in, teaching, maudgaly, yana, relies, much, on, such, powers, varying, accounts, in, the, pali, canon, show, maudgaly, yana, travelling, to, and, speaking, with, pretas, spirits, in, unhappy, destinations, in, order, to, explain, to, them, their, horrific, conditions, he, helps, them, understand, their, own, suffering, so, they, can, be, released, from, it, or, come, to, terms, with, it, he, then, reports, this, to, the, buddha, who, uses, these, examples, in, his, teachings, similarly, maudgaly, yana, is, depicted, as, conversing, with, devas, and, brahmas, heavenly, beings, and, asking, devas, what, deeds, they, did, to, be, reborn, in, heaven, in, summary, maudgaly, yana, s, meditative, insights, and, psychic, powers, are, not, only, to, his, own, benefit, but, benefit, the, public, at, large, in, the, words, of, historian, julie, gifford, he, guides, others, by, providing, a, cosmological, and, karmic, map, of, samsara, maudgaly, yana, is, able, to, use, his, powers, of, mind, reading, in, order, to, give, good, and, fitting, advice, to, his, students, so, they, can, attain, spiritual, fruits, quickly, he, is, described, as, using, his, psychic, powers, to, discipline, not, only, monks, but, also, devas, and, other, beings, one, day, some, monks, are, making, noise, as, they, were, sitting, in, the, same, building, as, the, buddha, maudgaly, yana, then, shakes, the, building, to, teach, the, monks, to, be, more, restrained, but, the, most, quoted, example, of, maudgaly, yana, s, demonstration, of, psychic, powers, is, his, victory, over, the, dragon, naga, nandopananda, which, requires, mastery, of, the, jh, nas, states, in, meditation, many, of, his, demonstrations, of, psychic, powers, are, an, indirect, means, of, establishing, the, buddha, as, a, great, teacher, people, ask, themselves, if, the, disciple, has, these, powers, then, how, spiritually, powerful, will, his, teacher, be, the, account, of, maudgaly, yana, looking, for, his, mother, after, her, death, is, widespread, apart, from, being, used, to, illustrate, the, principles, of, karmic, retribution, and, rebirth, in, china, the, story, developed, a, new, emphasis, there, maudgaly, yana, was, known, as, mulian, and, his, story, was, taught, in, a, mixture, of, religious, instruction, and, entertainment, to, remind, people, of, their, duties, to, deceased, relatives, its, earliest, version, being, the, sanskrit, ullambana, sutra, the, story, has, been, made, popular, in, china, japan, and, korea, through, edifying, folktales, such, as, the, chinese, bianwen, for, example, the, transformation, text, on, mu, lien, saving, his, mother, from, the, dark, regions, in, most, versions, of, the, story, maudgaly, yana, uses, his, psychic, powers, to, look, for, his, deceased, parents, and, see, in, what, world, they, have, been, reborn, although, he, can, find, his, father, in, a, heaven, he, cannot, find, his, mother, and, asks, the, buddha, for, help, the, buddha, brings, him, to, his, mother, who, is, located, in, a, hell, realm, but, maudgaly, yana, cannot, help, her, the, buddha, then, advises, him, to, make, merits, on, his, mother, s, behalf, which, helps, her, to, be, reborn, in, a, better, place, in, the, laotian, version, of, the, story, he, travels, to, the, world, of, yama, the, ruler, of, the, underworld, only, to, find, the, world, abandoned, yama, then, tells, maudgaly, yana, that, he, allows, the, denizens, of, the, hell, to, go, out, of, the, gates, of, hell, to, be, free, for, one, day, that, is, on, the, full, moon, day, of, the, ninth, lunar, month, on, this, day, the, hell, beings, can, receive, merit, transferred, and, be, liberated, from, hell, if, such, merit, is, transferred, to, them, in, some, other, chinese, accounts, maudgaly, yana, finds, his, mother, reborn, as, a, hungry, ghost, when, maudgaly, yana, tries, to, offer, her, food, through, an, ancestral, shrine, the, food, bursts, into, flames, each, time, maudgaly, yana, therefore, asks, the, buddha, for, advice, who, recommends, him, to, make, merit, to, the, sa, gha, and, transfer, it, to, his, mother, the, transfer, not, only, helps, his, mother, to, be, reborn, in, heaven, but, can, also, be, used, to, help, seven, generations, of, parents, and, ancestors, the, offering, was, believed, to, be, most, effective, when, collectively, done, which, led, to, the, arising, of, the, ghost, festival, see, heritage, several, scholars, have, pointed, out, the, similarities, between, the, accounts, of, maudgaly, yana, helping, his, mother, and, the, account, of, phra, malai, an, influential, legend, in, thailand, and, laos, indeed, in, some, traditional, accounts, phra, malai, is, compared, to, maudgaly, yana, on, a, similar, note, maudgaly, yana, s, account, is, also, thought, to, have, influenced, the, central, asian, epic, of, king, gesar, maudgaly, yana, being, a, model, for, the, king, another, account, involving, maudgalyayana, related, in, the, chinese, translation, of, the, ekottara, ag, ma, in, the, thai, jinak, lam, l, and, the, post, canonical, pa, saj, tak, was, the, production, of, what, was, described, as, the, first, buddha, image, the, ud, yana, buddha, the, account, relates, that, the, buddha, pays, a, visit, to, the, tr, yastri, a, heaven, pali, t, vati, sa, to, teach, his, mother, king, ud, yana, misses, the, buddha, so, much, that, he, asks, maudgaly, yana, to, use, his, psychic, powers, to, transport, thirty, two, craftsmen, to, the, heaven, and, make, an, image, of, the, buddha, there, the, image, that, is, eventually, made, is, from, sandalwood, and, many, accounts, have, attempted, to, relate, it, to, later, buddha, images, in, other, areas, and, countries, although, the, traditional, accounts, mentioned, state, that, the, ud, yana, buddha, was, the, first, image, there, were, probably, several, buddha, images, preceding, the, ud, yana, buddha, made, by, both, kings, and, commoners, it, could, also, be, that, these, accounts, originate, from, the, same, common, narrative, about, a, first, buddha, image, according, to, the, pali, tradition, maudgaly, yana, s, death, comes, in, november, of, the, same, year, as, the, buddha, s, passing, when, maudgaly, yana, is, traveling, in, magadha, he, dies, at, the, age, of, eighty, four, some, accounts, put, forth, that, rivaling, traditions, stone, him, to, death, others, say, that, those, people, hire, robbers, the, pali, tradition, states, that, jain, monks, persuade, a, group, of, robbers, led, by, a, sama, a, guttaka, to, kill, maudgaly, yana, out, of, jealousy, for, his, success, maudgaly, yana, often, teaches, about, the, visits, he, has, made, to, heaven, and, hell, the, fruits, of, leading, a, moral, life, and, the, dangers, of, leading, an, immoral, life, these, teachings, make, the, number, of, followers, from, rivaling, traditions, decrease, whoever, kills, maudgaly, yana, the, general, agreement, among, different, accounts, is, that, he, is, killed, in, a, violent, fashion, at, the, k, lasil, cave, on, the, isigili, hill, near, r, jagaha, which, might, be, equated, with, modern, udaya, hill, at, that, time, maudgaly, yana, dwells, alone, in, a, forest, hut, when, he, sees, the, bandits, approaching, he, makes, himself, vanish, with, psychic, powers, the, bandits, find, an, empty, hut, and, although, they, search, everywhere, they, find, nobody, they, leave, and, return, on, the, following, day, for, six, consecutive, days, with, maudgaly, yana, escaping, from, them, in, the, same, way, on, the, seventh, day, maudgaly, yana, suddenly, loses, the, psychic, powers, he, has, long, wielded, maudgaly, yana, realizes, that, he, is, now, unable, to, escape, the, bandits, enter, beat, him, repeatedly, and, leave, him, lying, in, his, blood, being, keen, on, quickly, getting, their, payment, they, leave, at, once, maudgaly, yana, s, great, physical, and, mental, strength, is, such, that, he, is, able, to, regain, consciousness, and, is, able, to, journey, to, the, buddha, in, some, accounts, he, then, returns, to, kalasila, and, dies, there, teaching, his, family, before, dying, in, other, accounts, he, dies, in, the, buddha, s, presence, it, is, described, that, in, a, previous, life, maudgaly, yana, is, the, only, son, born, to, his, family, he, is, dutiful, and, takes, care, of, all, the, household, duties, as, his, parents, age, this, increases, his, workload, his, parents, urge, him, to, find, a, wife, to, help, him, but, he, persistently, refuses, insisting, on, doing, the, work, himself, after, persistent, urging, from, his, mother, he, eventually, marries, his, wife, looks, after, his, elderly, parents, but, after, a, short, period, becomes, hostile, to, them, she, complains, to, her, husband, but, he, pays, no, attention, to, this, one, day, when, he, is, outside, the, house, she, scatters, rubbish, around, and, when, he, returns, blames, it, on, his, blind, parents, after, continual, complaints, he, capitulates, and, agrees, to, deal, with, his, parents, telling, his, parents, that, their, relatives, in, another, region, wish, to, see, them, he, leads, his, parents, onto, a, carriage, and, begins, driving, the, oxen, cart, through, the, forest, while, in, the, depths, of, the, forest, he, dismounts, and, walks, along, with, the, carriage, telling, his, parents, that, he, has, to, watch, out, for, robbers, which, are, common, in, the, area, he, then, impersonates, the, sounds, and, cries, of, thieves, pretending, to, attack, the, carriage, his, parents, tell, him, to, fend, for, himself, as, they, are, old, and, blind, and, implore, the, imaginary, thieves, to, leave, their, son, while, they, are, crying, out, the, man, beats, and, kills, his, parents, and, throws, their, bodies, into, the, forest, before, returning, home, in, another, version, recorded, in, the, commentary, to, the, pali, j, taka, maudgaly, yana, does, not, carry, the, murder, through, though, touched, by, the, words, of, his, parents, after, maudgaly, yana, s, death, people, ask, why, maudgaly, yana, had, not, protected, himself, and, why, a, great, enlightened, monk, would, suffer, such, a, death, the, buddha, then, says, that, because, maudgaly, yana, has, contracted, such, karma, in, a, previous, life, the, murder, of, one, s, own, parents, is, one, of, the, five, heinous, acts, that, reap, the, worst, karma, so, he, could, not, avoid, reaping, the, consequences, he, therefore, accepted, the, results, further, the, buddha, states, that, even, psychic, powers, will, be, of, no, use, in, avoiding, karma, especially, when, it, is, serious, karma, shortly, after, having, left, maudgaly, yana, for, dead, the, bandits, are, all, executed, religious, studies, scholar, james, mcdermott, therefore, concludes, that, there, must, have, been, a, confluence, of, karma, between, maudgaly, yana, and, the, bandits, and, cites, the, killing, as, evidence, that, in, buddhist, doctrine, the, karma, of, different, individuals, can, interact, indologist, richard, gombrich, raises, the, example, of, the, murder, to, prove, another, point, he, points, out, that, maudgaly, yana, is, able, to, attain, enlightenment, despite, his, heavy, karma, from, a, past, life, this, he, says, shows, that, the, buddha, teaches, everyone, can, attain, enlightenment, in, the, here, and, now, rather, than, enlightenment, necessarily, being, a, gradual, process, built, up, through, many, lifetimes, gifford, speculates, that, maudgaly, yana, believes, he, is, experiencing, heavy, karma, from, a, past, life, this, awareness, leads, him, to, want, to, prevent, others, from, making, the, same, mistakes, and, leading, an, unethical, life, this, may, be, the, reason, why, he, is, so, intent, on, teaching, about, the, law, of, karmic, retribution, after, maudgaly, yana, s, and, riputra, s, death, the, buddha, states, the, monastic, community, has, now, become, less, just, like, a, healthy, tree, has, some, branches, that, have, died, off, then, he, adds, to, that, all, impermanent, things, must, perish, in, some, accounts, of, maudgaly, yana, s, death, many, of, his, students, fall, ill, after, his, death, and, die, as, well, in, buddhist, history, maudgaly, yana, has, been, honored, for, several, reasons, in, some, canons, such, as, the, pali, tipi, aka, maudgaly, yana, is, held, up, by, the, buddha, as, an, example, which, monks, should, follow, the, pali, name, moggall, na, was, used, as, a, monastic, name, by, buddhist, monks, up, until, the, twelfth, century, c, e, in, east, asia, maudgaly, yana, is, honored, as, a, symbol, of, filial, piety, and, psychic, powers, maudgaly, yana, has, had, an, important, role, in, many, mah, y, na, traditions, the, ullambana, sutra, is, the, main, mah, y, na, s, tra, in, which, maudgaly, yana, s, rescue, of, his, mother, is, described, see, rescuing, his, mother, the, sutra, was, highly, influential, judging, from, the, more, than, sixty, commentaries, that, were, written, about, it, although, the, original, sanskrit, sutra, already, encouraged, filial, piety, later, chinese, accounts, inspired, by, the, sutra, emphasized, this, even, more, furthermore, chinese, accounts, described, merit, making, practices, and, filial, piety, as, two, inseparable, sides, of, the, same, coin, the, s, tra, became, popular, in, china, japan, and, korea, and, led, to, the, yulan, hui, china, and, obon, japan, festivals, this, festival, probably, spread, from, china, to, japan, in, the, seventh, century, and, similar, festivals, have, been, observed, in, india, avalamba, laos, and, vietnam, the, festival, is, celebrated, on, the, seventh, lunar, month, china, originally, only, on, the, full, moon, on, the, prav, ra, a, day, or, from, 13, to, 15, july, japan, it, is, believed, that, in, this, period, ancestors, reborn, as, pretas, or, hungry, ghosts, wander, around, in, china, this, was, the, time, when, the, yearly, var, a, for, monastics, came, to, an, end, normally, translated, as, rains, retreat, but, in, china, this, was, a, summer, retreat, it, was, a, time, that, the, monastics, completed, their, studies, and, meditation, which, was, celebrated, up, until, the, present, day, people, make, merits, and, transfer, merit, through, several, ceremonies, during, the, festival, so, the, spirits, may, be, reborn, in, a, better, rebirth, the, festival, is, also, popular, among, non, buddhists, and, has, led, taoists, to, integrate, it, in, their, own, funeral, services, the, festival, has, striking, similarities, to, confucian, and, neo, confucian, ideals, in, that, it, deals, with, filial, piety, it, has, been, observed, that, the, account, of, rescuing, the, mother, in, hell, has, helped, buddhism, to, integrate, into, chinese, society, at, the, time, due, to, the, buddhist, emphasis, on, the, renunciant, life, buddhism, was, criticized, by, confucianists, they, felt, buddhism, went, against, the, principle, of, filial, piety, because, buddhist, monks, did, not, have, offspring, to, make, offerings, for, ancestor, worship, maudgaly, yana, s, account, helped, greatly, to, improve, this, problem, and, has, therefore, been, raised, as, a, textbook, example, of, the, adaptive, qualities, of, buddhism, other, scholars, have, proposed, however, that, the, position, of, buddhism, in, india, versus, china, was, not, all, that, different, as, buddhism, had, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, filial, piety, and, renunciation, in, india, as, well, another, impact, the, story, of, maudgaly, yana, s, had, was, that, in, east, asia, the, account, helped, to, shift, the, emphasis, of, filial, piety, towards, the, mother, and, helped, redefine, motherhood, and, femininity, apart, from, the, ghost, festival, maudgaly, yana, also, has, an, important, role, in, the, celebration, of, m, gha, p, j, in, sri, lanka, on, m, gha, p, j, in, sri, lanka, called, navam, full, moon, poya, maudgaly, yana, s, appointment, as, a, chief, disciple, of, the, buddha, is, celebrated, by, various, merit, making, activities, and, a, pageant, there, are, several, canonical, and, post, canonical, texts, that, are, traditionally, connected, to, the, person, of, maudgaly, yana, in, the, therav, da, tradition, the, vim, navatthu, is, understood, to, be, a, collection, of, accounts, related, by, maudgalyayana, to, the, buddha, dealing, with, his, visits, to, heavens, in, the, sarv, stiv, da, tradition, maudgaly, yana, is, said, to, have, composed, the, abhidharma, texts, called, the, dharmaskandha, and, the, praj, ptibh, sya, although, in, some, sanskrit, and, tibetan, scriptures, the, former, is, attributed, to, riputra, scholars, have, their, doubts, on, whether, maudgaly, yana, was, really, the, author, of, these, works, they, do, believe, however, that, maudgaly, yana, and, some, other, main, disciples, compiled, lists, sanskrit, m, t, ik, pali, m, tik, of, teachings, as, mnemonic, devices, these, lists, formed, the, basis, for, what, later, became, the, abhidharma, despite, these, associations, with, abhidharma, texts, pilgrim, xuan, zang, reports, that, during, his, visits, in, india, riputra, was, honored, by, monks, for, his, abhidharma, teachings, whereas, maudgaly, yana, was, honored, for, his, meditation, the, basis, for, psychic, powers, french, scholar, andr, migot, has, proposed, that, in, most, text, traditions, maudgaly, yana, was, associated, with, meditation, and, psychic, powers, as, opposed, to, riputra, s, specialization, in, wisdom, and, abhidharma, traditions, have, also, connected, maudgaly, yana, with, the, symbol, of, the, wheel, of, becoming, sanskrit, bhavacakra, pali, bhavacakka, accounts, in, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, vinaya, and, the, divy, vad, na, relate, that, nanda, once, told, the, buddha, about, maudgaly, yana, s, good, qualities, as, a, teacher, maudgalyayana, was, a, very, popular, teacher, and, his, sermons, with, regard, to, afterlife, destinations, were, very, popular, the, buddha, said, that, in, the, future, a, person, like, him, would, be, hard, to, find, the, buddha, then, had, an, image, painted, on, the, gate, of, the, veluva, a, monastery, to, honor, maudgaly, yana, depicting, the, wheel, of, becoming, this, wheel, showed, the, different, realms, of, the, cycle, of, existence, the, three, poisons, in, the, mind, greed, hatred, and, delusion, and, the, teaching, of, dependent, origination, the, wheel, was, depicted, as, being, in, the, clutches, of, m, ra, but, at, the, same, time, included, the, symbol, of, a, white, circle, for, nirvana, the, buddha, further, decreed, that, a, monk, be, stationed, at, the, painting, to, explain, the, law, of, karma, to, visitors, images, of, the, wheel, of, becoming, are, widespread, in, buddhist, asia, some, of, which, confirm, and, depict, the, original, connection, with, maudgaly, yana, finally, there, was, also, an, entire, tradition, that, traces, its, origins, to, maudgalyayana, or, to, a, follower, of, him, called, dharmagupta, this, is, the, dharmaguptaka, school, one, of, the, early, buddhist, schools, a, shaft, was, sunk, in, the, centre, of, this, tope, and, after, a, few, hours, labour, we, came, to, a, large, slab, upwards, of, 5, feet, in, length, lying, in, a, direction, from, north, to, south, on, raising, this, slab, we, saw, two, large, stone, boxes, each, bearing, a, short, inscription, on, its, lid, that, to, the, south, bore, sariputasa, of, sariputra, that, to, the, north, bore, maha, mogalanasa, of, maha, mogalana, sir, alexander, cunningham, the, bhilsa, topes, in, a, pali, j, taka, account, the, buddha, is, said, to, have, had, the, ashes, of, maudgaly, yana, collected, and, kept, in, a, st, pa, in, the, gateway, of, the, veluva, a, in, two, other, accounts, however, one, from, the, dharmaguptaka, and, the, other, from, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, tradition, an, thapi, ika, and, other, laypeople, requested, the, buddha, to, build, a, st, pa, in, honor, of, maudgaly, yana, according, to, the, divy, vad, na, emperor, ashoka, visited, the, st, pa, and, made, an, offering, on, the, advice, of, upagupta, thera, during, the, succeeding, centuries, xuan, zang, and, other, chinese, pilgrims, reported, that, a, st, pa, with, maudgaly, yana, s, relics, could, be, found, under, the, indian, city, mathura, and, in, several, other, places, in, northeast, india, however, as, of, 1999, none, of, these, had, been, confirmed, by, archaeological, findings, an, important, archaeological, finding, was, made, elsewhere, however, in, the, nineteenth, century, archaeologist, alexander, cunningham, and, lieutenant, fred, c, maisey, discovered, bone, fragments, in, caskets, with, maudgaly, yana, s, and, riputra, s, names, inscribed, on, it, both, in, the, sanchi, st, pa, and, at, the, st, pas, at, satdh, ra, india, the, caskets, contained, pieces, of, bone, and, objects, of, reverence, including, sandalwood, which, cunningham, believed, had, once, been, used, on, the, funeral, pyre, of, riputra, the, finding, was, important, in, several, ways, and, was, dated, from, the, context, to, the, second, century, bce, initially, cunningham, and, maisey, divided, the, shares, of, the, discovered, items, and, had, them, shipped, to, britain, since, some, of, cunningham, s, discovered, items, were, lost, when, one, ship, sank, some, scholars, have, understood, that, the, sanchi, relics, were, lost, however, in, a, 2007, study, the, historian, torkel, brekke, used, extensive, historical, documents, to, argument, that, it, was, maisey, who, took, all, the, relics, with, him, not, cunningham, this, would, imply, that, the, relics, reached, britain, in, their, entirety, after, the, relics, reached, britain, they, were, given, to, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, in, london, in, 1866, when, the, relics, were, given, to, the, v, a, museum, pressure, from, buddhists, to, return, the, relics, to, their, country, of, origin, arose, although, at, first, the, museum, dismissed, the, complaints, as, coming, from, a, marginal, community, of, english, buddhists, when, several, buddhist, societies, in, india, took, notice, as, well, as, societies, in, other, asian, countries, it, became, a, serious, matter, eventually, the, museum, was, pressured, by, the, british, government, to, return, the, relics, and, their, original, caskets, for, diplomatic, reasons, after, many, requests, and, much, correspondence, the, museum, had, the, relics, brought, back, to, the, sri, lankan, maha, bodhi, society, in, 1947, they, were, formally, re, installed, into, a, shrine, at, sanchi, india, in, 1952, after, it, had, been, agreed, that, buddhists, would, continue, to, be, their, caretaker, and, a, long, series, of, ceremonies, had, been, held, to, pay, due, respect, the, relics, were, paraded, through, many, countries, in, south, and, southeast, asia, in, both, therav, da, and, mah, y, na, countries, at, the, same, time, indian, prime, minister, nehru, used, the, opportunity, to, propagate, a, message, of, unity, and, religious, tolerance, and, from, a, political, perspective, legitimate, state, power, indeed, even, for, other, countries, such, as, burma, in, which, the, relics, were, shown, it, helped, to, legitimate, the, government, create, unity, and, revive, religious, practice, those, tiny, pieces, of, bone, moved, not, only, millions, of, devotees, worldwide, but, national, governments, as, well, as, stated, by, art, historian, jack, daulton, for, these, reasons, burma, asked, for, a, portion, of, the, relics, to, keep, there, in, ceremonies, attended, by, hundred, of, thousands, people, the, relics, were, installed, in, the, kaba, aye, pagoda, in, the, same, year, as, india, sri, lanka, also, obtained, a, portion, kept, at, the, maha, bodhi, society, which, is, annually, exhibited, during, a, celebration, in, may, in, 2015, the, catholic, world, was, surprised, to, witness, that, the, maha, bodhi, society, broke, with, tradition, by, showing, the, relics, to, pope, francis, on, a, day, outside, of, the, yearly, festival, responding, to, critics, the, head, of, the, society, stated, that, no, pope, had, set, foot, inside, a, buddhist, temple, since, 1984, and, added, that, religious, leaders, have, to, play, a, positive, role, to, unite, communities, instead, of, dividing, as, for, the, original, sanchi, site, in, india, the, relics, are, shown, every, year, on, the, annual, international, buddhist, festival, in, november, as, of, 2016, the, exhibition, was, visited, by, hundred, thousands, visitors, from, over, the, world, including, thai, princess, sirindhorn
