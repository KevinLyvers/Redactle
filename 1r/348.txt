socialism, he, was, attracted, to, its, logic, its, sense, of, justice, and, its, preoccupation, with, the, destitute, and, the, disadvantaged, however, his, russian, orthodox, faith, and, religious, sensibilities, could, not, accord, with, belinsky, s, admixture, of, atheism, utilitarianism, and, scientific, materialism, leading, to, increasing, friction, between, them, dostoevsky, eventually,

time, rival, turgenev, embraced, him, konstantin, staniukovich, praised, the, speech, in, his, essay, the, pushkin, anniversary, and, dostoevsky, s, speech, in, the, business, writing, that, the, language, of, dostoevsky, s, really, looks, like, a, sermon, he, speaks, with, the, tone, of, a, prophet, he, makes, a, sermon, like, a, pastor, it, is, very, deep, sincere, and, we, understand, that, he, wants, to, impress, the, emotions, of, his, listeners, the, speech, was, criticised, later, by, liberal, political, scientist, alexander, gradovsky, who, thought, that, dostoevsky, idolised, the, people, and, by, conservative, thinker, konstantin, leontiev, who, in, his, essay, on, universal, love, compared, the, speech, to, french, utopian, socialism, the, attacks, led, to, a, further, deterioration, in, his, health, on, 6, february, 1881, while, searching, for, members, of, the, terrorist, organisation, narodnaya, volya, the, people, s, will, who, would, soon, assassinate, tsar,

haemorrhage, anna, denied, that, the, search, had, caused, it, saying, that, the, haemorrhage, had, occurred, after, her, husband, had, been, looking, for, a, dropped, pen, holder, after, another, haemorrhage, anna, called, the, doctors, who, gave, a, poor, prognosis, a, third, haemorrhage, followed, shortly, afterwards, while, seeing, his, children, before, dying, dostoevsky, requested, that, the, parable, of, the, prodigal, son, be, read, to, his, children, the, profound, meaning, of, this, request, is, pointed, out, by, joseph, frank, it, was, this, parable, of, transgression, repentance, and, forgiveness, that, he, wished, to, leave, as, a, last, heritage, to, his, children, and, it, may, well, be, seen, as, his, own, ultimate, understanding, of, the, meaning, of, his, life, and, the, message, of, his, work, among, dostoevsky, s, last, words, was, his, quotation, of, matthew, 3, 14, 15, but, john, forbad, him, saying, i, have, a, need, to, be, baptised, of, thee, and, comest, thou, to, me, and, jesus, answering, said, unto, him, suffer, it, to, be, so, now, for, thus, it, becometh, us, to, fulfil, all, righteousness, and, he, finished, with, hear, now, permit, it, do, not, restrain, me, his, last, words, to, his, wife, anna, were, remember, anya, i, have, always, loved, you, passionately, and, have, never, been, unfaithful, to, you, ever, even, in, my, thoughts, when, he, died, his, body, was, placed, on, a, table, following, russian, custom, he, was, interred, in, the, tikhvin, cemetery, at, the, alexander, nevsky, convent, near, his, favourite, poets, nikolay, karamzin, and, vasily, zhukovsky, it, is, unclear, how, many, attended, his, funeral, according, to, one, reporter, more, than, 100, 000, mourners, were, present, while, others, describe, attendance, between, 40, 000, and, 50, 000, his, tombstone, is, inscribed, with, lines, from, the, new, testament, verily, verily, i, say, unto, you, except, a, corn, of, wheat, fall, into, the, ground, and, die, it, abideth, alone, but, if, it, dies, it, bringeth, forth, much, fruit, dostoevsky, had, his, first, known, affair, with, avdotya, panaeva, whom, he, met, in, the, ivan, panaev, s, circle, in, the, early, 1840s, he, described, her, as, educated, interested, in, literature, and, a, femme, fatale, he, admitted, later, that, he, was, uncertain, about, their, relationship, according, to, anna, dostoevskaya, s, memoirs, dostoevsky, once, asked, his, sister, s, sister, in, law, yelena, ivanova, whether, she, would, marry, him, hoping, to, replace, her, mortally, ill, husband, after, he, died, but, she, rejected, his, proposal, dostoevsky, and, polina, suslova, had, a, short, but, intimate, affair, which, peaked, in, the, winter, of, 1862, 1863, suslova, s, dalliance, with, a, spaniard, in, late, spring, and, dostoevsky, s, gambling, addiction, and, age, ended, their, relationship, he, later, described, her, in, a, letter, to, nadezhda, suslova, as, a, great, egoist, her, egoism, and, her, vanity, are, colossal, she, demands, everything, of, other, people, all, the, perfections, and, does, not, pardon, the, slightest, imperfection, in, the, light, of, other, qualities, that, one, may, possess, and, later, stated, i, still, love, her, but, i, do, not, want, to, love, her, any, more, she, doesn, t, deserve, this, love, in, 1858, dostoevsky, had, a, romance, with, comic, actress, aleksandra, ivanovna, schubert, although, she, divorced, dostoevsky, s, friend, stepan, yanovsky, she, would, not, live, with, him, dostoevsky, did, not, love, her, either, but, they, were, probably, good, friends, she, wrote, that, he, became, very, attracted, to, me, through, a, worker, in, epoch, dostoevsky, learned, of, the, russian, born, martha, brown, n, e, elizaveta, andreyevna, chlebnikova, who, had, had, affairs, with, several, westerners, her, relationship, with, dostoevsky, is, known, only, through, letters, written, between, november, 1864, and, january, 1865, in, 1865, dostoevsky, met, anna, korvin, krukovskaya, their, relationship, is, not, verified, anna, dostoevskaya, spoke, of, a, good, affair, but, korvin, krukovskaya, s, sister, the, mathematician, sofia, kovalevskaya, thought, that, korvin, krukovskaya, had, rejected, him, in, his, youth, dostoevsky, enjoyed, reading, nikolai, karamzin, s, history, of, the, russian, state, which, praised, conservatism, and, russian, independence, ideas, that, dostoevsky, would, embrace, later, in, life, before, his, arrest, for, participating, in, the, petrashevsky, circle, in, 1849, dostoevsky, remarked, as, far, as, i, am, concerned, nothing, was, ever, more, ridiculous, than, the, idea, of, a, republican, government, in, russia, in, an, 1881, edition, of, his, diaries, dostoevsky, stated, that, the, tsar, and, the, people, should, form, a, unity, for, the, people, the, tsar, is, not, an, external, power, not, the, power, of, some, conqueror, but, a, power, of, all, the, people, an, all, unifying, power, the, people, themselves, desired, while, critical, of, serfdom, dostoevsky, was, skeptical, about, the, creation, of, a, constitution, a, concept, he, viewed, as, unrelated, to, russia, s, history, he, described, it, as, a, mere, gentleman, s, rule, and, believed, that, a, constitution, would, simply, enslave, the, people, he, advocated, social, change, instead, for, example, removal, of, the, feudal, system, and, a, weakening, of, the, divisions, between, the, peasantry, and, the, affluent, classes, his, ideal, was, a, utopian, christianized, russia, where, if, everyone, were, actively, christian, not, a, single, social, question, would, come, up, if, they, were, christians, they, would, settle, everything, he, thought, democracy, and, oligarchy, were, poor, systems, of, france, he, wrote, the, oligarchs, are, only, concerned, with, the, interest, of, the, wealthy, the, democrats, only, with, the, interest, of, the, poor, but, the, interests, of, society, the, interest, of, all, and, the, future, of, france, as, a, whole, no, one, there, bothers, about, these, things, he, maintained, that, political, parties, ultimately, led, to, social, discord, in, the, 1860s, he, discovered, pochvennichestvo, a, movement, similar, to, slavophilism, in, that, it, rejected, europe, s, culture, and, contemporary, philosophical, movements, such, as, nihilism, and, materialism, pochvennichestvo, differed, from, slavophilism, in, aiming, to, establish, not, an, isolated, russia, but, a, more, open, state, modelled, on, the, russia, of, peter, the, great, in, his, incomplete, article, socialism, and, christianity, dostoevsky, claimed, that, civilisation, the, second, stage, in, human, history, had, become, degraded, and, that, it, was, moving, towards, liberalism, and, losing, its, faith, in, god, he, asserted, that, the, traditional, concept, of, christianity, should, be, recovered, he, thought, that, contemporary, western, europe, had, rejected, the, single, formula, for, their, salvation, that, came, from, god, and, was, proclaimed, through, revelation, thou, shalt, love, thy, neighbour, as, thyself, and, replaced, it, with, practical, conclusions, such, as, chacun, pour, soi, et, dieu, pour, tous, or, scientific, slogans, like, the, struggle, for, survival, he, considered, this, crisis, to, be, the, consequence, of, the, collision, between, communal, and, individual, interests, brought, about, by, a, decline, in, religious, and, moral, principles, dostoevsky, distinguished, three, enormous, world, ideas, prevalent, in, his, time, roman, catholicism, protestantism, and, russian, orthodoxy, he, claimed, that, catholicism, had, continued, the, tradition, of, imperial, rome, and, had, thus, become, anti, christian, and, proto, socialist, inasmuch, as, the, church, s, interest, in, political, and, mundane, affairs, led, it, to, abandon, the, idea, of, christ, for, dostoevsky, socialism, was, the, latest, incarnation, of, the, catholic, idea, and, its, natural, ally, he, found, protestantism, self, contradictory, and, claimed, that, it, would, ultimately, lose, power, and, spirituality, he, deemed, russian, orthodoxy, to, be, the, ideal, form, of, christianity, for, all, that, to, place, dostoevsky, politically, is, not, that, simple, but, as, a, christian, he, rejected, atheistic, socialism, as, a, traditionalist, he, rejected, the, destruction, of, the, institutions, and, as, a, pacifist, he, rejected, any, violent, method, or, upheaval, led, by, either, progressives, or, reactionaries, he, supported, private, property, and, business, rights, and, did, not, agree, with, many, criticisms, of, the, free, market, from, the, socialist, utopians, of, his, time, during, the, russo, turkish, war, dostoevsky, asserted, that, war, might, be, necessary, if, salvation, were, to, be, granted, he, wanted, the, muslim, ottoman, empire, eliminated, and, the, christian, byzantine, empire, restored, and, he, hoped, for, the, liberation, of, balkan, slavs, and, their, unification, with, the, russian, empire, many, characters, in, dostoevsky, s, works, including, jews, have, been, described, as, displaying, negative, stereotypes, in, an, 1877, letter, to, arkady, kovner, a, jew, who, had, accused, dostoevsky, of, antisemitism, he, replied, with, the, following, i, am, not, an, enemy, of, the, jews, at, all, and, never, have, been, but, as, you, say, its, 40, century, existence, proves, that, this, tribe, has, exceptional, vitality, which, would, not, help, during, the, course, of, its, history, taking, the, form, of, various, status, in, statu, how, can, they, fail, to, find, themselves, even, if, only, partially, at, variance, with, the, indigenous, population, the, russian, tribe, dostoevsky, held, to, a, pan, slavic, ideology, that, was, conditioned, by, the, ottoman, occupations, of, eastern, europe, in, 1876, the, slavic, populations, of, serbia, and, bulgaria, rose, up, against, their, ottoman, overlords, but, the, rebellion, was, put, down, in, the, process, an, estimated, 12, 000, people, were, killed, in, his, diaries, he, scorned, westerners, and, those, who, were, against, the, pan, slavic, movement, this, ideology, was, motivated, in, part, by, the, desire, to, promote, a, common, orthodox, christian, heritage, which, he, saw, as, both, unifying, as, well, as, a, force, for, liberation, dostoevsky, was, an, orthodox, christian, who, was, raised, in, a, religious, family, and, knew, the, gospel, from, a, very, young, age, he, was, influenced, by, the, russian, translation, of, johannes, h, bner, s, one, hundred, and, four, sacred, stories, from, the, old, and, new, testaments, selected, for, children, partly, a, german, bible, for, children, and, partly, a, catechism, he, attended, sunday, liturgies, from, an, early, age, and, took, part, in, annual, pilgrimages, to, the, st, sergius, trinity, monastery, a, deacon, at, the, hospital, gave, him, religious, instruction, among, his, most, cherished, childhood, memories, were, reciting, prayers, in, front, of, guests, and, reading, passages, from, the, book, of, job, that, impressed, him, while, still, almost, a, child, according, to, an, officer, at, the, military, academy, dostoevsky, was, profoundly, religious, followed, orthodox, practice, and, regularly, read, the, gospels, and, heinrich, zschokke, s, die, stunden, der, andacht, hours, of, devotion, which, preached, a, sentimental, version, of, christianity, entirely, free, from, dogmatic, content, and, with, a, strong, emphasis, on, giving, christian, love, a, social, application, this, book, may, have, prompted, his, later, interest, in, christian, socialism, through, the, literature, of, hoffmann, balzac, eug, ne, sue, and, goethe, dostoevsky, created, his, own, belief, system, similar, to, russian, sectarianism, and, the, old, belief, after, his, arrest, aborted, execution, and, subsequent, imprisonment, he, focused, intensely, on, the, figure, of, christ, and, on, the, new, testament, the, only, book, allowed, in, prison, in, a, january, 1854, letter, to, the, woman, who, had, sent, him, the, new, testament, dostoevsky, wrote, that, he, was, a, child, of, unbelief, and, doubt, up, to, this, moment, and, i,

are, peopled, by, neurotics, and, lunatics, and, states, that, dostoevsky, s, characters, do, not, develop, we, get, them, all, complete, at, the, beginning, of, the, tale, and, so, they, remain, he, finds, the, novels, full, of, contrived, surprises, and, complications, of, plot, which, are, effective, when, first, read, but, on, second, reading, without, the, shock, and, benefit, of, these,
