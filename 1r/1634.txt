https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel
augustin, jean, fresnel, 10, may, 1788, 14, july, 1827, was, a, french, civil, engineer, and, physicist, whose, research, in, optics, led, to, the, almost, unanimous, acceptance, of, the, wave, theory, of, light, excluding, any, remnant, of, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, from, the, late, 1830s, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, he, is, perhaps, better, known, for, inventing, the, catadioptric, reflective, refractive, fresnel, lens, and, for, pioneering, the, use, of, stepped, lenses, to, extend, the, visibility, of, lighthouses, saving, countless, lives, at, sea, the, simpler, dioptric, purely, refractive, stepped, lens, first, proposed, by, count, buffon, and, independently, reinvented, by, fresnel, is, used, in, screen, magnifiers, and, in, condenser, lenses, for, overhead, projectors, by, expressing, huygens, s, principle, of, secondary, waves, and, young, s, principle, of, interference, in, quantitative, terms, and, supposing, that, simple, colors, consist, of, sinusoidal, waves, fresnel, gave, the, first, satisfactory, explanation, of, diffraction, by, straight, edges, including, the, first, satisfactory, wave, based, explanation, of, rectilinear, propagation, part, of, his, argument, was, a, proof, that, the, addition, of, sinusoidal, functions, of, the, same, frequency, but, different, phases, is, analogous, to, the, addition, of, forces, with, different, directions, by, further, supposing, that, light, waves, are, purely, transverse, fresnel, explained, the, nature, of, polarization, the, mechanism, of, chromatic, polarization, and, the, transmission, and, reflection, coefficients, at, the, interface, between, two, transparent, isotropic, media, then, by, generalizing, the, direction, speed, polarization, relation, for, calcite, he, accounted, for, the, directions, and, polarizations, of, the, refracted, rays, in, doubly, refractive, crystals, of, the, biaxial, class, those, for, which, huygens, s, secondary, wavefronts, are, not, axisymmetric, the, period, between, the, first, publication, of, his, pure, transverse, wave, hypothesis, and, the, submission, of, his, first, correct, solution, to, the, biaxial, problem, was, less, than, a, year, later, he, coined, the, terms, linear, polarization, circular, polarization, and, elliptical, polarization, explained, how, optical, rotation, could, be, understood, as, a, difference, in, propagation, speeds, for, the, two, directions, of, circular, polarization, and, by, allowing, the, reflection, coefficient, to, be, complex, accounted, for, the, change, in, polarization, due, to, total, internal, reflection, as, exploited, in, the, fresnel, rhomb, defenders, of, the, established, corpuscular, theory, could, not, match, his, quantitative, explanations, of, so, many, phenomena, on, so, few, assumptions, fresnel, had, a, lifelong, battle, with, tuberculosis, to, which, he, succumbed, at, the, age, of, 39, although, he, did, not, become, a, public, celebrity, in, his, lifetime, he, lived, just, long, enough, to, receive, due, recognition, from, his, peers, including, on, his, deathbed, the, rumford, medal, of, the, royal, society, of, london, and, his, name, is, ubiquitous, in, the, modern, terminology, of, optics, and, waves, after, the, wave, theory, of, light, was, subsumed, by, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, theory, in, the, 1860s, some, attention, was, diverted, from, the, magnitude, of, fresnel, s, contribution, in, the, period, between, fresnel, s, unification, of, physical, optics, and, maxwell, s, wider, unification, a, contemporary, authority, humphrey, lloyd, described, fresnel, s, transverse, wave, theory, as, the, noblest, fabric, which, has, ever, adorned, the, domain, of, physical, science, newton, s, system, of, the, universe, alone, excepted, augustin, jean, fresnel, also, called, augustin, jean, or, simply, augustin, born, in, broglie, normandy, on, 10, may, 1788, was, the, second, of, four, sons, of, the, architect, jacques, fresnel, and, his, wife, augustine, n, e, m, rim, e, the, family, moved, twice, in, 1789, 90, to, cherbourg, and, in, 1794, to, jacques, s, home, town, of, mathieu, where, augustine, would, spend, 25, years, as, a, widow, outliving, two, of, her, sons, the, first, son, louis, was, admitted, to, the, cole, polytechnique, became, a, lieutenant, in, the, artillery, and, was, killed, in, action, at, jaca, spain, the, third, l, onor, followed, augustin, into, civil, engineering, succeeded, him, as, secretary, of, the, lighthouse, commission, and, helped, to, edit, his, collected, works, the, fourth, fulgence, fresnel, became, a, linguist, diplomat, and, orientalist, and, occasionally, assisted, augustin, with, negotiations, fulgence, died, in, bagdad, in, 1855, having, led, a, mission, to, explore, babylon, madame, fresnel, s, younger, brother, jean, fran, ois, l, onor, m, rim, e, father, of, the, writer, prosper, m, rim, e, was, a, painter, who, turned, his, attention, to, the, chemistry, of, painting, he, became, the, permanent, secretary, of, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, and, until, 1814, a, professor, at, the, cole, polytechnique, and, was, the, initial, point, of, contact, between, augustin, and, the, leading, optical, physicists, of, the, day, see, below, the, fresnel, brothers, were, initially, home, schooled, by, their, mother, the, sickly, augustin, was, considered, the, slow, one, not, inclined, to, memorization, but, the, popular, story, that, he, hardly, began, to, read, until, the, age, of, eight, is, disputed, at, the, age, of, nine, or, ten, he, was, undistinguished, except, for, his, ability, to, turn, tree, branches, into, toy, bows, and, guns, that, worked, far, too, well, earning, himself, the, title, l, homme, de, g, nie, the, man, of, genius, from, his, accomplices, and, a, united, crackdown, from, their, elders, in, 1801, augustin, was, sent, to, the, cole, centrale, at, caen, as, company, for, louis, but, augustin, lifted, his, performance, in, late, 1804, he, was, accepted, into, the, cole, polytechnique, being, placed, 17th, in, the, entrance, examination, as, the, detailed, records, of, the, cole, polytechnique, begin, in, 1808, we, know, little, of, augustin, s, time, there, except, that, he, made, few, if, any, friends, and, in, spite, of, continuing, poor, health, excelled, in, drawing, and, geometry, in, his, first, year, he, took, a, prize, for, his, solution, to, a, geometry, problem, posed, by, adrien, marie, legendre, graduating, in, 1806, he, then, enrolled, at, the, cole, nationale, des, ponts, et, chauss, es, national, school, of, bridges, and, roads, also, known, as, enpc, or, cole, des, ponts, from, which, he, graduated, in, 1809, entering, the, service, of, the, corps, des, ponts, et, chauss, es, as, an, ing, nieur, ordinaire, aspirant, ordinary, engineer, in, training, directly, or, indirectly, he, was, to, remain, in, the, employment, of, the, corps, des, ponts, for, the, rest, of, his, life, fresnel, s, parents, were, roman, catholics, of, the, jansenist, sect, characterized, by, an, extreme, augustinian, view, of, original, sin, religion, took, first, place, in, the, boys, home, schooling, in, 1802, his, mother, said, i, pray, god, to, give, my, son, the, grace, to, employ, the, great, talents, which, he, has, received, for, his, own, benefit, and, for, the, god, of, all, much, will, be, asked, from, him, to, whom, much, has, been, given, and, most, will, be, required, of, him, who, has, received, most, augustin, remained, a, jansenist, he, regarded, his, intellectual, talents, as, gifts, from, god, and, considered, it, his, duty, to, use, them, for, the, benefit, of, others, according, to, his, fellow, engineer, alphonse, duleau, who, helped, to, nurse, him, through, his, final, illness, fresnel, saw, the, study, of, nature, as, part, of, the, study, of, the, power, and, goodness, of, god, he, placed, virtue, above, science, and, genius, in, his, last, days, he, prayed, for, strength, of, soul, not, against, death, alone, but, against, the, interruption, of, discoveries, of, which, he, hoped, to, derive, useful, applications, jansenism, is, considered, heretical, by, the, roman, catholic, church, and, grattan, guinness, suggests, this, is, why, fresnel, never, gained, a, permanent, academic, teaching, post, his, only, teaching, appointment, was, at, the, ath, n, e, in, the, winter, of, 1819, 20, the, article, on, fresnel, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, does, not, mention, his, jansenism, but, describes, him, as, a, deeply, religious, man, and, remarkable, for, his, keen, sense, of, duty, fresnel, was, initially, posted, to, the, western, d, partement, of, vend, e, there, in, 1811, he, anticipated, what, became, known, as, the, solvay, process, for, producing, soda, ash, except, that, recycling, of, the, ammonia, was, not, considered, that, difference, may, explain, why, leading, chemists, who, learned, of, his, discovery, through, his, uncle, l, onor, eventually, thought, it, uneconomic, about, 1812, fresnel, was, sent, to, nyons, in, the, southern, d, partement, of, dr, me, to, assist, with, the, imperial, highway, that, was, to, connect, spain, and, italy, it, is, from, nyons, that, we, have, the, first, evidence, of, his, interest, in, optics, on, 15, may, 1814, while, work, was, slack, due, to, napoleon, s, defeat, fresnel, wrote, a, p, s, to, his, brother, l, onor, saying, in, part, i, would, also, like, to, have, papers, that, might, tell, me, about, the, discoveries, of, french, physicists, on, the, polarization, of, light, i, saw, in, the, moniteur, of, a, few, months, ago, that, biot, had, read, to, the, institute, a, very, interesting, memoir, on, the, polarization, of, light, though, i, break, my, head, i, cannot, guess, what, that, is, as, late, as, 28, december, he, was, still, waiting, for, information, but, by, 10, february, 1815, he, had, received, biot, s, memoir, the, institut, de, france, had, taken, over, the, functions, of, the, french, acad, mie, des, sciences, and, other, acad, mies, in, 1795, in, 1816, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, regained, its, name, and, autonomy, but, remained, part, of, the, institute, in, march, 1815, perceiving, napoleon, s, return, from, elba, as, an, attack, on, civilization, fresnel, departed, without, leave, hastened, to, toulouse, and, offered, his, services, to, the, royalist, resistance, but, soon, found, himself, on, the, sick, list, returning, to, nyons, in, defeat, he, was, threatened, and, had, his, windows, broken, during, the, hundred, days, he, was, placed, on, suspension, which, he, was, eventually, allowed, to, spend, at, his, mother, s, house, in, mathieu, there, he, used, his, enforced, leisure, to, begin, his, optical, experiments, the, appreciation, of, fresnel, s, reconstruction, of, physical, optics, might, be, assisted, by, an, overview, of, the, fragmented, state, in, which, he, found, the, subject, in, this, subsection, optical, phenomena, that, were, unexplained, or, whose, explanations, were, disputed, are, named, in, bold, type, the, corpuscular, theory, of, light, favored, by, isaac, newton, and, accepted, by, nearly, all, of, fresnel, s, seniors, easily, explained, rectilinear, propagation, the, corpuscles, obviously, moved, very, fast, so, that, their, paths, were, very, nearly, straight, the, wave, theory, as, developed, by, christiaan, huygens, in, his, treatise, on, light, 1690, explained, rectilinear, propagation, on, the, assumption, that, each, point, crossed, by, a, traveling, wavefront, becomes, the, source, of, a, secondary, wavefront, given, the, initial, position, of, a, traveling, wavefront, any, later, position, according, to, huygens, was, the, common, tangent, surface, envelope, of, the, secondary, wavefronts, emitted, from, the, earlier, position, as, the, extent, of, the, common, tangent, was, limited, by, the, extent, of, the, initial, wavefront, the, repeated, application, of, huygens, s, construction, to, a, plane, wavefront, of, limited, extent, in, a, uniform, medium, gave, a, straight, parallel, beam, while, this, construction, indeed, predicted, rectilinear, propagation, it, was, difficult, to, reconcile, with, the, common, observation, that, wavefronts, on, the, surface, of, water, can, bend, around, obstructions, and, with, the, similar, behavior, of, sound, waves, causing, newton, to, maintain, to, the, end, of, his, life, that, if, light, consisted, of, waves, it, would, bend, and, spread, every, way, into, the, shadows, huygens, s, theory, neatly, explained, the, law, of, ordinary, reflection, and, the, law, of, ordinary, refraction, snell, s, law, provided, that, the, secondary, waves, traveled, slower, in, denser, media, those, of, higher, refractive, index, the, corpuscular, theory, with, the, hypothesis, that, the, corpuscles, were, subject, to, forces, acting, perpendicular, to, surfaces, explained, the, same, laws, equally, well, albeit, with, the, implication, that, light, traveled, faster, in, denser, media, that, implication, was, wrong, but, could, not, be, directly, disproven, with, the, technology, of, newton, s, time, or, even, fresnel, s, time, see, foucault, s, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, similarly, inconclusive, was, stellar, aberration, that, is, the, apparent, change, in, the, position, of, a, star, due, to, the, velocity, of, the, earth, across, the, line, of, sight, not, to, be, confused, with, stellar, parallax, which, is, due, to, the, displacement, of, the, earth, across, the, line, of, sight, identified, by, james, bradley, in, 1728, stellar, aberration, was, widely, taken, as, confirmation, of, the, corpuscular, theory, but, it, was, equally, compatible, with, the, wave, theory, as, euler, noted, in, 1746, tacitly, assuming, that, the, aether, the, supposed, wave, bearing, medium, near, the, earth, was, not, disturbed, by, the, motion, of, the, earth, the, outstanding, strength, of, huygens, s, theory, was, his, explanation, of, the, birefringence, double, refraction, of, iceland, crystal, transparent, calcite, on, the, assumption, that, the, secondary, waves, are, spherical, for, the, ordinary, refraction, which, satisfies, snell, s, law, and, spheroidal, for, the, extraordinary, refraction, which, does, not, in, general, huygens, s, common, tangent, construction, implies, that, rays, are, paths, of, least, time, between, successive, positions, of, the, wavefront, in, accordance, with, fermat, s, principle, in, the, special, case, of, isotropic, media, the, secondary, wavefronts, must, be, spherical, and, huygens, s, construction, then, implies, that, the, rays, are, perpendicular, to, the, wavefront, indeed, the, law, of, ordinary, refraction, can, be, separately, derived, from, that, premise, as, ignace, gaston, pardies, did, before, huygens, although, newton, rejected, the, wave, theory, he, noticed, its, potential, to, explain, colors, including, the, colors, of, thin, plates, e, g, newton, s, rings, and, the, colors, of, skylight, reflected, in, soap, bubbles, on, the, assumption, that, light, consists, of, periodic, waves, with, the, lowest, frequencies, longest, wavelengths, at, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, and, the, highest, frequencies, shortest, wavelengths, at, the, violet, end, in, 1672, he, published, a, heavy, hint, to, that, effect, 5088, 5089, but, contemporary, supporters, of, the, wave, theory, failed, to, act, on, it, robert, hooke, treated, light, as, a, periodic, sequence, of, pulses, but, did, not, use, frequency, as, the, criterion, of, color, while, huygens, treated, the, waves, as, individual, pulses, without, any, periodicity, and, pardies, died, young, in, 1673, newton, himself, tried, to, explain, colors, of, thin, plates, using, the, corpuscular, theory, by, supposing, that, his, corpuscles, had, the, wavelike, property, of, alternating, between, fits, of, easy, transmission, and, fits, of, easy, reflection, the, distance, between, like, fits, depending, on, the, color, and, the, medium, and, awkwardly, on, the, angle, of, refraction, or, reflection, into, that, medium, 1144, more, awkwardly, still, this, theory, required, thin, plates, to, reflect, only, at, the, back, surface, although, thick, plates, manifestly, reflected, also, at, the, front, surface, it, was, not, until, 1801, that, thomas, young, in, the, bakerian, lecture, for, that, year, cited, newton, s, hint, 18, 19, and, accounted, for, the, colors, of, a, thin, plate, as, the, combined, effect, of, the, front, and, back, reflections, which, reinforce, or, cancel, each, other, according, to, the, wavelength, and, the, thickness, 37, 39, young, similarly, explained, the, colors, of, striated, surfaces, e, g, gratings, as, the, wavelength, dependent, reinforcement, or, cancellation, of, reflections, from, adjacent, lines, 35, 37, he, described, this, reinforcement, or, cancellation, as, interference, neither, newton, nor, huygens, satisfactorily, explained, diffraction, the, blurring, and, fringing, of, shadows, where, according, to, rectilinear, propagation, they, ought, to, be, sharp, newton, who, called, diffraction, inflexion, supposed, that, rays, of, light, passing, close, to, obstacles, were, bent, inflected, but, his, explanation, was, only, qualitative, huygens, s, common, tangent, construction, without, modifications, could, not, accommodate, diffraction, at, all, two, such, modifications, were, proposed, by, young, in, the, same, 1801, bakerian, lecture, first, that, the, secondary, waves, near, the, edge, of, an, obstacle, could, diverge, into, the, shadow, but, only, weakly, due, to, limited, reinforcement, from, other, secondary, waves, 25, 27, and, second, that, diffraction, by, an, edge, was, caused, by, interference, between, two, rays, one, reflected, off, the, edge, and, the, other, inflected, while, passing, near, the, edge, the, latter, ray, would, be, undeviated, if, sufficiently, far, from, the, edge, but, young, did, not, elaborate, on, that, case, 42, 44, these, were, the, earliest, suggestions, that, the, degree, of, diffraction, depends, on, wavelength, later, in, the, 1803, bakerian, lecture, young, ceased, to, regard, inflection, as, a, separate, phenomenon, and, produced, evidence, that, diffraction, fringes, inside, the, shadow, of, a, narrow, obstacle, were, due, to, interference, when, the, light, from, one, side, was, blocked, the, internal, fringes, disappeared, but, young, was, alone, in, such, efforts, until, fresnel, entered, the, field, huygens, in, his, investigation, of, double, refraction, noticed, something, that, he, could, not, explain, when, light, passes, through, two, similarly, oriented, calcite, crystals, at, normal, incidence, the, ordinary, ray, emerging, from, the, first, crystal, suffers, only, the, ordinary, refraction, in, the, second, while, the, extraordinary, ray, emerging, from, the, first, suffers, only, the, extraordinary, refraction, in, the, second, but, when, the, second, crystal, is, rotated, 90, about, the, incident, rays, the, roles, are, interchanged, so, that, the, ordinary, ray, emerging, from, the, first, crystal, suffers, only, the, extraordinary, refraction, in, the, second, and, vice, versa, this, discovery, gave, newton, another, reason, to, reject, the, wave, theory, rays, of, light, evidently, had, sides, corpuscles, could, have, sides, or, poles, as, they, would, later, be, called, but, waves, of, light, could, not, because, so, it, seemed, any, such, waves, would, need, to, be, longitudinal, with, vibrations, in, the, direction, of, propagation, newton, offered, an, alternative, rule, for, the, extraordinary, refraction, which, rode, on, his, authority, through, the, 18th, century, although, he, made, no, known, attempt, to, deduce, it, from, any, principles, of, optics, corpuscular, or, otherwise, 327, in, 1808, the, extraordinary, refraction, of, calcite, was, investigated, experimentally, with, unprecedented, accuracy, by, tienne, louis, malus, and, found, to, be, consistent, with, huygens, s, spheroid, construction, not, newton, s, rule, malus, encouraged, by, pierre, simon, laplace, 1146, then, sought, to, explain, this, law, in, corpuscular, terms, from, the, known, relation, between, the, incident, and, refracted, ray, directions, malus, derived, the, corpuscular, velocity, as, a, function, of, direction, that, would, satisfy, maupertuis, s, least, action, principle, but, as, young, pointed, out, the, existence, of, such, a, velocity, law, was, guaranteed, by, huygens, s, spheroid, because, huygens, s, construction, leads, to, fermat, s, principle, which, becomes, maupertuis, s, principle, if, the, ray, speed, is, replaced, by, the, reciprocal, of, the, particle, speed, the, corpuscularists, had, not, found, a, force, law, that, would, yield, the, alleged, velocity, law, except, by, a, circular, argument, in, which, a, force, acting, at, the, surface, of, the, crystal, inexplicably, depended, on, the, direction, of, the, possibly, subsequent, velocity, within, the, crystal, worse, it, was, doubtful, that, any, such, force, would, satisfy, the, conditions, of, maupertuis, s, principle, in, contrast, young, proceeded, to, show, that, a, medium, more, easily, compressible, in, one, direction, than, in, any, direction, perpendicular, to, it, as, if, it, consisted, of, an, infinite, number, of, parallel, plates, connected, by, a, substance, somewhat, less, elastic, admits, spheroidal, longitudinal, wavefronts, as, huygens, supposed, but, malus, in, the, midst, of, his, experiments, on, double, refraction, noticed, something, else, when, a, ray, of, light, is, reflected, off, a, non, metallic, surface, at, the, appropriate, angle, it, behaves, like, one, of, the, two, rays, emerging, from, a, calcite, crystal, it, was, malus, who, coined, the, term, polarization, to, describe, this, behavior, although, the, polarizing, angle, became, known, as, brewster, s, angle, after, its, dependence, on, the, refractive, index, was, determined, experimentally, by, david, brewster, in, 1815, malus, also, introduced, the, term, plane, of, polarization, in, the, case, of, polarization, by, reflection, his, plane, of, polarization, was, the, plane, of, the, incident, and, reflected, rays, in, modern, terms, this, is, the, plane, normal, to, the, electric, vibration, in, 1809, malus, further, discovered, that, the, intensity, of, light, passing, through, two, polarizers, is, proportional, to, the, squared, cosine, of, the, angle, between, their, planes, of, polarization, malus, s, law, whether, the, polarizers, work, by, reflection, or, double, refraction, and, that, all, birefringent, crystals, produce, both, extraordinary, refraction, and, polarization, as, the, corpuscularists, started, trying, to, explain, these, things, in, terms, of, polar, molecules, of, light, the, wave, theorists, had, no, working, hypothesis, on, the, nature, of, polarization, prompting, young, to, remark, that, malus, s, observations, present, greater, difficulties, to, the, advocates, of, the, undulatory, theory, than, any, other, facts, with, which, we, are, acquainted, malus, died, in, february, 1812, at, the, age, of, 36, shortly, after, receiving, the, rumford, medal, for, his, work, on, polarization, in, august, 1811, fran, ois, arago, reported, that, if, a, thin, plate, of, mica, was, viewed, against, a, white, polarized, backlight, through, a, calcite, crystal, the, two, images, of, the, mica, were, of, complementary, colors, the, overlap, having, the, same, color, as, the, background, the, light, emerging, from, the, mica, was, de, polarized, in, the, sense, that, there, was, no, orientation, of, the, calcite, that, made, one, image, disappear, yet, it, was, not, ordinary, un, polarized, light, for, which, the, two, images, would, be, of, the, same, color, rotating, the, calcite, around, the, line, of, sight, changed, the, colors, though, they, remained, complementary, rotating, the, mica, changed, the, saturation, not, the, hue, of, the, colors, this, phenomenon, became, known, as, chromatic, polarization, replacing, the, mica, with, a, much, thicker, plate, of, quartz, with, its, faces, perpendicular, to, the, optic, axis, the, axis, of, huygens, s, spheroid, or, malus, s, velocity, function, produced, a, similar, effect, except, that, rotating, the, quartz, made, no, difference, arago, tried, to, explain, his, observations, in, corpuscular, terms, in, 1812, as, arago, pursued, further, qualitative, experiments, and, other, commitments, jean, baptiste, biot, reworked, the, same, ground, using, a, gypsum, lamina, in, place, of, the, mica, and, found, empirical, formulae, for, the, intensities, of, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, images, the, formulae, contained, two, coefficients, supposedly, representing, colors, of, rays, affected, and, unaffected, by, the, plate, the, affected, rays, being, of, the, same, color, mix, as, those, reflected, by, amorphous, thin, plates, of, proportional, but, lesser, thickness, arago, protested, declaring, that, he, had, made, some, of, the, same, discoveries, but, had, not, had, time, to, write, them, up, in, fact, the, overlap, between, arago, s, work, and, biot, s, was, minimal, arago, s, being, only, qualitative, and, wider, in, scope, attempting, to, include, polarization, by, reflection, but, the, dispute, triggered, a, notorious, falling, out, between, the, two, men, later, that, year, biot, tried, to, explain, the, observations, as, an, oscillation, of, the, alignment, of, the, affected, corpuscles, at, a, frequency, proportional, to, that, of, newton, s, fits, due, to, forces, depending, on, the, alignment, this, theory, became, known, as, mobile, polarization, to, reconcile, his, results, with, a, sinusoidal, oscillation, biot, had, to, suppose, that, the, corpuscles, emerged, with, one, of, two, permitted, orientations, namely, the, extremes, of, the, oscillation, with, probabilities, depending, on, the, phase, of, the, oscillation, corpuscular, optics, was, becoming, expensive, on, assumptions, but, in, 1813, biot, reported, that, the, case, of, quartz, was, simpler, the, observable, phenomenon, now, called, optical, rotation, or, optical, activity, or, sometimes, rotary, polarization, was, a, gradual, rotation, of, the, polarization, direction, with, distance, and, could, be, explained, by, a, corresponding, rotation, not, oscillation, of, the, corpuscles, early, in, 1814, reviewing, biot, s, work, on, chromatic, polarization, young, noted, that, the, periodicity, of, the, color, as, a, function, of, the, plate, thickness, including, the, factor, by, which, the, period, exceeded, that, for, a, reflective, thin, plate, and, even, the, effect, of, obliquity, of, the, plate, but, not, the, role, of, polarization, could, be, explained, by, the, wave, theory, in, terms, of, the, different, propagation, times, of, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, waves, through, the, plate, but, young, was, then, the, only, public, defender, of, the, wave, theory, in, summary, in, the, spring, of, 1814, as, fresnel, tried, in, vain, to, guess, what, polarization, was, the, corpuscularists, thought, that, they, knew, while, the, wave, theorists, if, we, may, use, the, plural, literally, had, no, idea, both, theories, claimed, to, explain, rectilinear, propagation, but, the, wave, explanation, was, overwhelmingly, regarded, as, unconvincing, the, corpuscular, theory, could, not, rigorously, link, double, refraction, to, surface, forces, the, wave, theory, could, not, yet, link, it, to, polarization, the, corpuscular, theory, was, weak, on, thin, plates, and, silent, on, gratings, the, wave, theory, was, strong, on, both, but, under, appreciated, concerning, diffraction, the, corpuscular, theory, did, not, yield, quantitative, predictions, while, the, wave, theory, had, begun, to, do, so, by, considering, diffraction, as, a, manifestation, of, interference, but, had, only, considered, two, rays, at, a, time, only, the, corpuscular, theory, gave, even, a, vague, insight, into, brewster, s, angle, malus, s, law, or, optical, rotation, concerning, chromatic, polarization, the, wave, theory, explained, the, periodicity, far, better, than, the, corpuscular, theory, but, had, nothing, to, say, about, the, role, of, polarization, and, its, explanation, of, the, periodicity, was, largely, ignored, and, arago, had, founded, the, study, of, chromatic, polarization, only, to, lose, the, lead, controversially, to, biot, such, were, the, circumstances, in, which, arago, first, heard, of, fresnel, s, interest, in, optics, fresnel, s, letters, from, later, in, 1814, reveal, his, interest, in, the, wave, theory, including, his, awareness, that, it, explained, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, and, was, at, least, compatible, with, stellar, aberration, eventually, he, compiled, what, he, called, his, r, veries, musings, into, an, essay, and, submitted, it, via, l, onor, m, rim, e, to, andr, marie, amp, re, who, did, not, respond, directly, but, on, 19, december, m, rim, e, dined, with, amp, re, and, arago, with, whom, he, was, acquainted, through, the, cole, polytechnique, and, arago, promised, to, look, at, fresnel, s, essay, in, mid, 1815, on, his, way, home, to, mathieu, to, serve, his, suspension, fresnel, met, arago, in, paris, and, spoke, of, the, wave, theory, and, stellar, aberration, he, was, informed, that, he, was, trying, to, break, down, open, doors, il, enfon, ait, des, portes, ouvertes, and, directed, to, classical, works, on, optics, on, 12, july, 1815, as, fresnel, was, about, to, leave, paris, arago, left, him, a, note, on, a, new, topic, i, do, not, know, of, any, book, that, contains, all, the, experiments, that, physicists, are, doing, on, the, diffraction, of, light, m, sieur, fresnel, will, only, be, able, to, get, to, know, this, part, of, the, optics, by, reading, the, work, by, grimaldi, the, one, by, newton, the, english, treatise, by, jordan, and, the, memoirs, of, brougham, and, young, which, are, part, of, the, collection, of, the, philosophical, transactions, fresnel, would, not, have, ready, access, to, these, works, outside, paris, and, could, not, read, english, but, in, mathieu, with, a, point, source, of, light, made, by, focusing, sunlight, with, a, drop, of, honey, a, crude, micrometer, of, his, own, construction, and, supporting, apparatus, made, by, a, local, locksmith, he, began, his, own, experiments, his, technique, was, novel, whereas, earlier, investigators, had, projected, the, fringes, onto, a, screen, fresnel, soon, abandoned, the, screen, and, observed, the, fringes, in, space, through, a, lens, with, the, micrometer, at, its, focus, allowing, more, accurate, measurements, while, requiring, less, light, later, in, july, after, napoleon, s, final, defeat, fresnel, was, reinstated, with, the, advantage, of, having, backed, the, winning, side, he, requested, a, two, month, leave, of, absence, which, was, readily, granted, because, roadworks, were, in, abeyance, on, 23, september, he, wrote, to, arago, beginning, i, think, i, have, found, the, explanation, and, the, law, of, colored, fringes, which, one, notices, in, the, shadows, of, bodies, illuminated, by, a, luminous, point, in, the, same, paragraph, however, fresnel, implicitly, acknowledged, doubt, about, the, novelty, of, his, work, noting, that, he, would, need, to, incur, some, expense, in, order, to, improve, his, measurements, he, wanted, to, know, whether, this, is, not, useless, and, whether, the, law, of, diffraction, has, not, already, been, established, by, sufficiently, exact, experiments, he, explained, that, he, had, not, yet, had, a, chance, to, acquire, the, items, on, his, reading, lists, with, the, apparent, exception, of, young, s, book, which, he, could, not, understand, without, his, brother, s, help, not, surprisingly, he, had, retraced, many, of, young, s, steps, in, a, memoir, sent, to, the, institute, on, 15, october, 1815, fresnel, mapped, the, external, and, internal, fringes, in, the, shadow, of, a, wire, he, noticed, like, young, before, him, that, the, internal, fringes, disappeared, when, the, light, from, one, side, was, blocked, and, concluded, that, the, vibrations, of, two, rays, that, cross, each, other, under, a, very, small, angle, can, contradict, each, other, but, whereas, young, took, the, disappearance, of, the, internal, fringes, as, confirmation, of, the, principle, of, interference, fresnel, reported, that, it, was, the, internal, fringes, that, first, drew, his, attention, to, the, principle, to, explain, the, diffraction, pattern, fresnel, constructed, the, internal, fringes, by, considering, the, intersections, of, circular, wavefronts, emitted, from, the, two, edges, of, the, obstruction, and, the, external, fringes, by, considering, the, intersections, between, direct, waves, and, waves, reflected, off, the, nearer, edge, for, the, external, fringes, to, obtain, tolerable, agreement, with, observation, he, had, to, suppose, that, the, reflected, wave, was, inverted, and, he, noted, that, the, predicted, paths, of, the, fringes, were, hyperbolic, in, the, part, of, the, memoir, that, most, clearly, surpassed, young, fresnel, explained, the, ordinary, laws, of, reflection, and, refraction, in, terms, of, interference, noting, that, if, two, parallel, rays, were, reflected, or, refracted, at, other, than, the, prescribed, angle, they, would, no, longer, have, the, same, phase, in, a, common, perpendicular, plane, and, every, vibration, would, be, cancelled, by, a, nearby, vibration, he, noted, that, his, explanation, was, valid, provided, that, the, surface, irregularities, were, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, on, 10, november, fresnel, sent, a, supplementary, note, dealing, with, newton, s, rings, and, with, gratings, including, for, the, first, time, transmission, gratings, although, in, that, case, the, interfering, rays, were, still, assumed, to, be, inflected, and, the, experimental, verification, was, inadequate, because, it, used, only, two, threads, as, fresnel, was, not, a, member, of, the, institute, the, fate, of, his, memoir, depended, heavily, on, the, report, of, a, single, member, the, reporter, for, fresnel, s, memoir, turned, out, to, be, arago, with, poinsot, as, the, other, reviewer, on, 8, november, arago, wrote, to, fresnel, i, have, been, instructed, by, the, institute, to, examine, your, memoir, on, the, diffraction, of, light, i, have, studied, it, carefully, and, found, many, interesting, experiments, some, of, which, had, already, been, done, by, dr, thomas, young, who, in, general, regards, this, phenomenon, in, a, manner, rather, analogous, to, the, one, you, have, adopted, but, what, neither, he, nor, anyone, had, seen, before, you, is, that, the, external, colored, bands, do, not, travel, in, a, straight, line, as, one, moves, away, from, the, opaque, body, the, results, you, have, achieved, in, this, regard, seem, to, me, very, important, perhaps, they, can, serve, to, prove, the, truth, of, the, undulatory, system, so, often, and, so, feebly, combated, by, physicists, who, have, not, bothered, to, understand, it, fresnel, was, troubled, wanting, to, know, more, precisely, where, he, had, collided, with, young, concerning, the, curved, paths, of, the, colored, bands, young, had, noted, the, hyperbolic, paths, of, the, fringes, in, the, two, source, interference, pattern, corresponding, roughly, to, fresnel, s, internal, fringes, and, had, described, the, hyperbolic, fringes, that, appear, on, the, screen, within, rectangular, shadows, he, had, not, mentioned, the, curved, paths, of, the, external, fringes, of, a, shadow, but, as, he, later, explained, that, was, because, newton, had, already, done, so, newton, evidently, thought, the, fringes, were, caustics, thus, arago, erred, in, his, belief, that, the, curved, paths, of, the, fringes, were, fundamentally, incompatible, with, the, corpuscular, theory, arago, s, letter, went, on, to, request, more, data, on, the, external, fringes, fresnel, complied, until, he, exhausted, his, leave, and, was, assigned, to, rennes, in, the, d, partement, of, ille, et, vilaine, at, this, point, arago, interceded, with, gaspard, de, prony, head, of, the, cole, des, ponts, who, wrote, to, louis, mathieu, mol, head, of, the, corps, des, ponts, suggesting, that, the, progress, of, science, and, the, prestige, of, the, corps, would, be, enhanced, if, fresnel, could, come, to, paris, for, a, time, he, arrived, in, march, 1816, and, his, leave, was, subsequently, extended, through, the, middle, of, the, year, meanwhile, in, an, experiment, reported, on, 26, february, 1816, arago, verified, fresnel, s, prediction, that, the, internal, fringes, were, shifted, if, the, rays, on, one, side, of, the, obstacle, passed, through, a, thin, glass, lamina, fresnel, correctly, attributed, this, phenomenon, to, the, lower, wave, velocity, in, the, glass, arago, later, used, a, similar, argument, to, explain, the, colors, in, the, scintillation, of, stars, fresnel, s, updated, memoir, was, eventually, published, in, the, march, 1816, issue, of, annales, de, chimie, et, de, physique, of, which, arago, had, recently, become, co, editor, that, issue, did, not, actually, appear, until, may, in, march, fresnel, already, had, competition, biot, read, a, memoir, on, diffraction, by, himself, and, his, student, claude, pouillet, containing, copious, data, and, arguing, that, the, regularity, of, diffraction, fringes, like, the, regularity, of, newton, s, rings, must, be, linked, to, newton, s, fits, but, the, new, link, was, not, rigorous, and, pouillet, himself, would, become, a, distinguished, early, adopter, of, the, wave, theory, on, 24, may, 1816, fresnel, wrote, to, young, in, french, acknowledging, how, little, of, his, own, memoir, was, new, but, in, a, supplement, signed, on, 14, july, and, read, the, next, day, fresnel, noted, that, the, internal, fringes, were, more, accurately, predicted, by, supposing, that, the, two, interfering, rays, came, from, some, distance, outside, the, edges, of, the, obstacle, to, explain, this, he, divided, the, incident, wavefront, at, the, obstacle, into, what, we, now, call, fresnel, zones, such, that, the, secondary, waves, from, each, zone, were, spread, over, half, a, cycle, when, they, arrived, at, the, observation, point, the, zones, on, one, side, of, the, obstacle, largely, canceled, out, in, pairs, except, the, first, zone, which, was, represented, by, an, efficacious, ray, this, approach, worked, for, the, internal, fringes, but, the, superposition, of, the, efficacious, ray, and, the, direct, ray, did, not, work, for, the, external, fringes, the, contribution, from, the, efficacious, ray, was, thought, to, be, only, partly, canceled, for, reasons, involving, the, dynamics, of, the, medium, where, the, wavefront, was, continuous, symmetry, forbade, oblique, vibrations, but, near, the, obstacle, that, truncated, the, wavefront, the, asymmetry, allowed, some, sideways, vibration, towards, the, geometric, shadow, this, argument, showed, that, fresnel, had, not, yet, fully, accepted, huygens, s, principle, which, would, have, permitted, oblique, radiation, from, all, portions, of, the, front, in, the, same, supplement, fresnel, described, his, well, known, double, mirror, comprising, two, flat, mirrors, joined, at, an, angle, of, slightly, less, than, 180, with, which, he, produced, a, two, slit, interference, pattern, from, two, virtual, images, of, the, same, slit, a, conventional, double, slit, experiment, required, a, preliminary, single, slit, to, ensure, that, the, light, falling, on, the, double, slit, was, coherent, synchronized, in, fresnel, s, version, the, preliminary, single, slit, was, retained, and, the, double, slit, was, replaced, by, the, double, mirror, which, bore, no, physical, resemblance, to, the, double, slit, and, yet, performed, the, same, function, this, result, which, had, been, announced, by, arago, in, the, march, issue, of, the, annales, made, it, hard, to, believe, that, the, two, slit, pattern, had, anything, to, do, with, corpuscles, being, deflected, as, they, passed, near, the, edges, of, the, slits, but, 1816, was, the, year, without, a, summer, crops, failed, hungry, farming, families, lined, the, streets, of, rennes, the, central, government, organized, charity, workhouses, for, the, needy, and, in, october, fresnel, was, sent, back, to, ille, et, vilaine, to, supervise, charity, workers, in, addition, to, his, regular, road, crew, according, to, arago, with, fresnel, conscientiousness, was, always, the, foremost, part, of, his, character, and, he, constantly, performed, his, duties, as, an, engineer, with, the, most, rigorous, scrupulousness, the, mission, to, defend, the, revenues, of, the, state, to, obtain, for, them, the, best, employment, possible, appeared, to, his, eyes, in, the, light, of, a, question, of, honour, the, functionary, whatever, might, be, his, rank, who, submitted, to, him, an, ambiguous, account, became, at, once, the, object, of, his, profound, contempt, under, such, circumstances, the, habitual, gentleness, of, his, manners, disappeared, fresnel, s, letters, from, december, 1816, reveal, his, consequent, anxiety, to, arago, he, complained, of, being, tormented, by, the, worries, of, surveillance, and, the, need, to, reprimand, and, to, m, rim, e, he, wrote, i, find, nothing, more, tiresome, than, having, to, manage, other, men, and, i, admit, that, i, have, no, idea, what, i, m, doing, on, 17, march, 1817, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, announced, that, diffraction, would, be, the, topic, for, the, biannual, physics, grand, prix, to, be, awarded, in, 1819, the, deadline, for, entries, was, set, at, 1, august, 1818, to, allow, time, for, replication, of, experiments, although, the, wording, of, the, problem, referred, to, rays, and, inflection, and, did, not, invite, wave, based, solutions, arago, and, amp, re, encouraged, fresnel, to, enter, in, the, fall, of, 1817, fresnel, supported, by, de, prony, obtained, a, leave, of, absence, from, the, new, head, of, the, corp, des, ponts, louis, becquey, and, returned, to, paris, he, resumed, his, engineering, duties, in, the, spring, of, 1818, but, from, then, on, he, was, based, in, paris, first, on, the, canal, de, l, ourcq, and, then, from, may, 1819, with, the, cadastre, of, the, pavements, 486, on, 15, january, 1818, in, a, different, context, revisited, below, fresnel, showed, that, the, addition, of, sinusoidal, functions, of, the, same, frequency, but, different, phases, is, analogous, to, the, addition, of, forces, with, different, directions, his, method, was, similar, to, the, phasor, representation, except, that, the, forces, were, plane, vectors, rather, than, complex, numbers, they, could, be, added, and, multiplied, by, scalars, but, not, yet, multiplied, and, divided, by, each, other, the, explanation, was, algebraic, rather, than, geometric, knowledge, of, this, method, was, assumed, in, a, preliminary, note, on, diffraction, dated, 19, april, 1818, and, deposited, on, 20, april, in, which, fresnel, outlined, the, elementary, theory, of, diffraction, as, found, in, modern, textbooks, he, restated, huygens, s, principle, in, combination, with, the, superposition, principle, saying, that, the, vibration, at, each, point, on, a, wavefront, is, the, sum, of, the, vibrations, that, would, be, sent, to, it, at, that, moment, by, all, the, elements, of, the, wavefront, in, any, of, its, previous, positions, all, elements, acting, separately, see, huygens, fresnel, principle, for, a, wavefront, partly, obstructed, in, a, previous, position, the, summation, was, to, be, carried, out, over, the, unobstructed, portion, in, directions, other, than, the, normal, to, the, primary, wavefront, the, secondary, waves, were, weakened, due, to, obliquity, but, weakened, much, more, by, destructive, interference, so, that, the, effect, of, obliquity, alone, could, be, ignored, for, diffraction, by, a, straight, edge, the, intensity, as, a, function, of, distance, from, the, geometric, shadow, could, then, be, expressed, with, sufficient, accuracy, in, terms, of, what, are, now, called, the, normalized, fresnel, integrals, the, same, note, included, a, table, of, the, integrals, for, an, upper, limit, ranging, from, 0, to, 5, 1, in, steps, of, 0, 1, computed, with, a, mean, error, of, 0, 0003, plus, a, smaller, table, of, maxima, and, minima, of, the, resulting, intensity, in, his, final, memoir, on, the, diffraction, of, light, deposited, on, 29, july, and, bearing, the, latin, epigraph, natura, simplex, et, fecunda, nature, simple, and, fertile, fresnel, slightly, expanded, the, two, tables, without, changing, the, existing, figures, except, for, a, correction, to, the, first, minimum, of, intensity, for, completeness, he, repeated, his, solution, to, the, problem, of, interference, whereby, sinusoidal, functions, are, added, like, vectors, he, acknowledged, the, directionality, of, the, secondary, sources, and, the, variation, in, their, distances, from, the, observation, point, chiefly, to, explain, why, these, things, make, negligible, difference, in, the, context, provided, of, course, that, the, secondary, sources, do, not, radiate, in, the, retrograde, direction, then, applying, his, theory, of, interference, to, the, secondary, waves, he, expressed, the, intensity, of, light, diffracted, by, a, single, straight, edge, half, plane, in, terms, of, integrals, which, involved, the, dimensions, of, the, problem, but, which, could, be, converted, to, the, normalized, forms, above, with, reference, to, the, integrals, he, explained, the, calculation, of, the, maxima, and, minima, of, the, intensity, external, fringes, and, noted, that, the, calculated, intensity, falls, very, rapidly, as, one, moves, into, the, geometric, shadow, the, last, result, as, olivier, darrigol, says, amounts, to, a, proof, of, the, rectilinear, propagation, of, light, in, the, wave, theory, indeed, the, first, proof, that, a, modern, physicist, would, still, accept, for, the, experimental, testing, of, his, calculations, fresnel, used, red, light, with, a, wavelength, of, 638, nm, which, he, deduced, from, the, diffraction, pattern, in, the, simple, case, in, which, light, incident, on, a, single, slit, was, focused, by, a, cylindrical, lens, for, a, variety, of, distances, from, the, source, to, the, obstacle, and, from, the, obstacle, to, the, field, point, he, compared, the, calculated, and, observed, positions, of, the, fringes, for, diffraction, by, a, half, plane, a, slit, and, a, narrow, strip, concentrating, on, the, minima, which, were, visually, sharper, than, the, maxima, for, the, slit, and, the, strip, he, could, not, use, the, previously, computed, table, of, maxima, and, minima, for, each, combination, of, dimensions, the, intensity, had, to, be, expressed, in, terms, of, sums, or, differences, of, fresnel, integrals, and, calculated, from, the, table, of, integrals, and, the, extrema, had, to, be, calculated, anew, the, agreement, between, calculation, and, measurement, was, better, than, 1, 5, in, almost, every, case, near, the, end, of, the, memoir, fresnel, summed, up, the, difference, between, huygens, s, use, of, secondary, waves, and, his, own, whereas, huygens, says, there, is, light, only, where, the, secondary, waves, exactly, agree, fresnel, says, there, is, complete, darkness, only, where, the, secondary, waves, exactly, cancel, out, the, judging, committee, comprised, laplace, biot, and, poisson, all, corpuscularists, gay, lussac, uncommitted, and, arago, who, eventually, wrote, the, committee, s, report, although, entries, in, the, competition, were, supposed, to, be, anonymous, to, the, judges, fresnel, s, must, have, been, recognizable, by, the, content, there, was, only, one, other, entry, of, which, neither, the, manuscript, nor, any, record, of, the, author, has, survived, that, entry, identified, as, no, 1, was, mentioned, only, in, the, last, paragraph, of, the, judges, report, noting, that, the, author, had, shown, ignorance, of, the, relevant, earlier, works, of, young, and, fresnel, used, insufficiently, precise, methods, of, observation, overlooked, known, phenomena, and, made, obvious, errors, in, the, words, of, john, worrall, the, competition, facing, fresnel, could, hardly, have, been, less, stiff, we, may, infer, that, the, committee, had, only, two, options, award, the, prize, to, fresnel, no, 2, or, withhold, it, the, committee, deliberated, into, the, new, year, 144, then, poisson, exploiting, a, case, in, which, fresnel, s, theory, gave, easy, integrals, predicted, that, if, a, circular, obstacle, were, illuminated, by, a, point, source, there, should, be, according, to, the, theory, a, bright, spot, in, the, center, of, the, shadow, illuminated, as, brightly, as, the, exterior, this, seems, to, have, been, intended, as, a, reductio, ad, absurdum, arago, undeterred, assembled, an, experiment, with, an, obstacle, 2, mm, in, diameter, and, there, in, the, center, of, the, shadow, was, poisson, s, spot, the, unanimous, report, of, the, committee, read, at, the, meeting, of, the, acad, mie, on, 15, march, 1819, awarded, the, prize, to, the, memoir, marked, no, 2, and, bearing, as, epigraph, natura, simplex, et, fecunda, at, the, same, meeting, 427, after, the, judgment, was, delivered, the, president, of, the, acad, mie, opened, a, sealed, note, accompanying, the, memoir, revealing, the, author, as, fresnel, the, award, was, announced, at, the, public, meeting, of, the, acad, mie, a, week, later, on, 22, march, 432, arago, s, verification, of, poisson, s, counter, intuitive, prediction, passed, into, folklore, as, if, it, had, decided, the, prize, that, view, however, is, not, supported, by, the, judges, report, which, gave, the, matter, only, two, sentences, in, the, penultimate, paragraph, neither, did, fresnel, s, triumph, immediately, convert, laplace, biot, and, poisson, to, the, wave, theory, for, at, least, four, reasons, first, although, the, professionalization, of, science, in, france, had, established, common, standards, it, was, one, thing, to, acknowledge, a, piece, of, research, as, meeting, those, standards, and, another, thing, to, regard, it, as, conclusive, second, it, was, possible, to, interpret, fresnel, s, integrals, as, rules, for, combining, rays, arago, even, encouraged, that, interpretation, presumably, in, order, to, minimize, resistance, to, fresnel, s, ideas, even, biot, began, teaching, the, huygens, fresnel, principle, without, committing, himself, to, a, wave, basis, third, fresnel, s, theory, did, not, adequately, explain, the, mechanism, of, generation, of, secondary, waves, or, why, they, had, any, significant, angular, spread, this, issue, particularly, bothered, poisson, fourth, the, question, that, most, exercised, optical, physicists, at, that, time, was, not, diffraction, but, polarization, on, which, fresnel, had, been, working, but, was, yet, to, make, his, critical, breakthrough, an, emission, theory, of, light, was, one, that, regarded, the, propagation, of, light, as, the, transport, of, some, kind, of, matter, while, the, corpuscular, theory, was, obviously, an, emission, theory, the, converse, did, not, follow, in, principle, one, could, be, an, emissionist, without, being, a, corpuscularist, this, was, convenient, because, beyond, the, ordinary, laws, of, reflection, and, refraction, emissionists, never, managed, to, make, testable, quantitative, predictions, from, a, theory, of, forces, acting, on, corpuscles, of, light, but, they, did, make, quantitative, predictions, from, the, premises, that, rays, were, countable, objects, which, were, conserved, in, their, interactions, with, matter, except, absorbent, media, and, which, had, particular, orientations, with, respect, to, their, directions, of, propagation, according, to, this, framework, polarization, and, the, related, phenomena, of, double, refraction, and, partial, reflection, involved, altering, the, orientations, of, the, rays, and, or, selecting, them, according, to, orientation, and, the, state, of, polarization, of, a, beam, a, bundle, of, rays, was, a, question, of, how, many, rays, were, in, what, orientations, in, a, fully, polarized, beam, the, orientations, were, all, the, same, this, approach, which, jed, buchwald, has, called, selectionism, was, pioneered, by, malus, and, diligently, pursued, by, biot, 110, 113, fresnel, in, contrast, decided, to, introduce, polarization, into, interference, experiments, in, july, or, august, 1816, fresnel, discovered, that, when, a, birefringent, crystal, produced, two, images, of, a, single, slit, he, could, not, obtain, the, usual, two, slit, interference, pattern, even, if, he, compensated, for, the, different, propagation, times, a, more, general, experiment, suggested, by, arago, found, that, if, the, two, beams, of, a, double, slit, device, were, separately, polarized, the, interference, pattern, appeared, and, disappeared, as, the, polarization, of, one, beam, was, rotated, giving, full, interference, for, parallel, polarizations, but, no, interference, for, perpendicular, polarizations, see, fresnel, arago, laws, these, experiments, among, others, were, eventually, reported, in, a, brief, memoir, published, in, 1819, and, later, translated, into, english, in, a, memoir, drafted, on, 30, august, 1816, and, revised, on, 6, october, fresnel, reported, an, experiment, in, which, he, placed, two, matching, thin, laminae, in, a, double, slit, apparatus, one, over, each, slit, with, their, optic, axes, perpendicular, and, obtained, two, interference, patterns, offset, in, opposite, directions, with, perpendicular, polarizations, this, in, combination, with, the, previous, findings, meant, that, each, lamina, split, the, incident, light, into, perpendicularly, polarized, components, with, different, velocities, just, like, a, normal, thick, birefringent, crystal, and, contrary, to, biot, s, mobile, polarization, hypothesis, accordingly, in, the, same, memoir, fresnel, offered, his, first, attempt, at, a, wave, theory, of, chromatic, polarization, when, polarized, light, passed, through, a, crystal, lamina, it, was, split, into, ordinary, and, extraordinary, waves, with, intensities, described, by, malus, s, law, and, these, were, perpendicularly, polarized, and, therefore, did, not, interfere, so, that, no, colors, were, produced, yet, but, if, they, then, passed, through, an, analyzer, second, polarizer, their, polarizations, were, brought, into, alignment, with, intensities, again, modified, according, to, malus, s, law, and, they, would, interfere, this, explanation, by, itself, predicts, that, if, the, analyzer, is, rotated, 90, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, waves, simply, switch, roles, so, that, if, the, analyzer, takes, the, form, of, a, calcite, crystal, the, two, images, of, the, lamina, should, be, of, the, same, hue, this, issue, is, revisited, below, but, in, fact, as, arago, and, biot, had, found, they, are, of, complementary, colors, to, correct, the, prediction, fresnel, proposed, a, phase, inversion, rule, whereby, one, of, the, constituent, waves, of, one, of, the, two, images, suffered, an, additional, 180, phase, shift, on, its, way, through, the, lamina, this, inversion, was, a, weakness, in, the, theory, relative, to, biot, s, as, fresnel, acknowledged, although, the, rule, specified, which, of, the, two, images, had, the, inverted, wave, moreover, fresnel, could, deal, only, with, special, cases, because, he, had, not, yet, solved, the, problem, of, superposing, sinusoidal, functions, with, arbitrary, phase, differences, due, to, propagation, at, different, velocities, through, the, lamina, he, solved, that, problem, in, a, supplement, signed, on, 15, january, 1818, mentioned, above, in, the, same, document, he, accommodated, malus, s, law, by, proposing, an, underlying, law, that, if, polarized, light, is, incident, on, a, birefringent, crystal, with, its, optic, axis, at, an, angle, to, the, plane, of, polarization, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, vibrations, as, functions, of, time, are, scaled, by, the, factors, cos, and, sin, respectively, although, modern, readers, easily, interpret, these, factors, in, terms, of, perpendicular, components, of, a, transverse, oscillation, fresnel, did, not, yet, explain, them, that, way, hence, he, still, needed, the, phase, inversion, rule, he, applied, all, these, principles, to, a, case, of, chromatic, polarization, not, covered, by, biot, s, formulae, involving, two, successive, laminae, with, axes, separated, by, 45, and, obtained, predictions, that, disagreed, with, biot, s, experiments, except, in, special, cases, but, agreed, with, his, own, fresnel, applied, the, same, principles, to, the, standard, case, of, chromatic, polarization, in, which, one, birefringent, lamina, was, sliced, parallel, to, its, axis, and, placed, between, a, polarizer, and, an, analyzer, if, the, analyzer, took, the, form, of, a, thick, calcite, crystal, with, its, axis, in, the, plane, of, polarization, fresnel, predicted, that, the, intensities, of, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, images, of, the, lamina, were, respectively, proportional, to, where, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, angle, from, the, initial, plane, of, polarization, to, the, optic, axis, of, the, lamina, s, displaystyle, s, is, the, angle, from, the, initial, plane, of, polarization, to, the, plane, of, polarization, of, the, final, ordinary, image, and, displaystyle, phi, is, the, phase, lag, of, the, extraordinary, wave, relative, to, the, ordinary, wave, due, to, the, difference, in, propagation, times, through, the, lamina, the, terms, in, displaystyle, phi, are, the, frequency, dependent, terms, and, explain, why, the, lamina, must, be, thin, in, order, to, produce, discernible, colors, if, the, lamina, is, too, thick, cos, displaystyle, cos, phi, will, pass, through, too, many, cycles, as, the, frequency, varies, through, the, visible, range, and, the, eye, which, divides, the, visible, spectrum, into, only, three, bands, will, not, be, able, to, resolve, the, cycles, from, these, equations, it, is, easily, verified, that, i, o, i, e, 1, displaystyle, i, o, i, e, 1, for, all, displaystyle, phi, so, that, the, colors, are, complementary, without, the, phase, inversion, rule, there, would, be, a, plus, sign, in, front, of, the, last, term, in, the, second, equation, so, that, the, displaystyle, phi, dependent, term, would, be, the, same, in, both, equations, implying, incorrectly, that, the, colors, were, of, the, same, hue, these, equations, were, included, in, an, undated, note, that, fresnel, gave, to, biot, to, which, biot, added, a, few, lines, of, his, own, if, we, substitute, then, fresnel, s, formulae, can, be, rewritten, as, which, are, none, other, than, biot, s, empirical, formulae, of, 1812, except, that, biot, interpreted, u, displaystyle, u, and, a, displaystyle, a, as, the, unaffected, and, affected, selections, of, the, rays, incident, on, the, lamina, if, biot, s, substitutions, were, accurate, they, would, imply, that, his, experimental, results, were, more, fully, explained, by, fresnel, s, theory, than, by, his, own, arago, delayed, reporting, on, fresnel, s, works, on, chromatic, polarization, until, june, 1821, when, he, used, them, in, a, broad, attack, on, biot, s, theory, in, his, written, response, biot, protested, that, arago, s, attack, went, beyond, the, proper, scope, of, a, report, on, the, nominated, works, of, fresnel, but, biot, also, claimed, that, the, substitutions, for, u, displaystyle, u, and, a, displaystyle, a, and, therefore, fresnel, s, expressions, for, i, o, displaystyle, i, o, and, i, e, displaystyle, i, e, were, empirically, wrong, because, when, fresnel, s, intensities, of, spectral, colors, were, mixed, according, to, newton, s, rules, the, squared, cosine, and, sine, functions, varied, too, smoothly, to, account, for, the, observed, sequence, of, colors, that, claim, drew, a, written, reply, from, fresnel, who, disputed, whether, the, colors, changed, as, abruptly, as, biot, claimed, and, whether, the, human, eye, could, judge, color, with, sufficient, objectivity, for, the, purpose, on, the, latter, question, fresnel, pointed, out, that, different, observers, may, give, different, names, to, the, same, color, furthermore, he, said, a, single, observer, can, only, compare, colors, side, by, side, and, even, if, they, are, judged, to, be, the, same, the, identity, is, of, sensation, not, necessarily, of, composition, fresnel, s, oldest, and, strongest, point, that, thin, crystals, were, subject, to, the, same, laws, as, thick, ones, and, did, not, need, or, allow, a, separate, theory, biot, left, unanswered, arago, and, fresnel, were, seen, to, have, won, the, debate, moreover, by, this, time, fresnel, had, a, new, simpler, explanation, of, his, equations, on, chromatic, polarization, in, the, draft, memoir, of, 30, august, 1816, fresnel, mentioned, two, hypotheses, one, of, which, he, attributed, to, amp, re, by, which, the, non, interference, of, orthogonally, polarized, beams, could, be, explained, if, polarized, light, waves, were, partly, transverse, but, fresnel, could, not, develop, either, of, these, ideas, into, a, comprehensive, theory, as, early, as, september, 1816, according, to, his, later, account, he, realized, that, the, non, interference, of, orthogonally, polarized, beams, together, with, the, phase, inversion, rule, in, chromatic, polarization, would, be, most, easily, explained, if, the, waves, were, purely, transverse, and, amp, re, had, the, same, thought, on, the, phase, inversion, rule, but, that, would, raise, a, new, difficulty, as, natural, light, seemed, to, be, un, polarized, and, its, waves, were, therefore, presumed, to, be, longitudinal, one, would, need, to, explain, how, the, longitudinal, component, of, vibration, disappeared, on, polarization, and, why, it, did, not, reappear, when, polarized, light, was, reflected, or, refracted, obliquely, by, a, glass, plate, independently, on, 12, january, 1817, young, wrote, to, arago, in, english, noting, that, a, transverse, vibration, would, constitute, a, polarization, and, that, if, two, longitudinal, waves, crossed, at, a, significant, angle, they, could, not, cancel, without, leaving, a, residual, transverse, vibration, young, repeated, this, idea, in, an, article, published, in, a, supplement, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, february, 1818, in, which, he, added, that, malus, s, law, would, be, explained, if, polarization, consisted, in, a, transverse, motion, 333, 335, thus, fresnel, by, his, own, testimony, may, not, have, been, the, first, person, to, suspect, that, light, waves, could, have, a, transverse, component, or, that, polarized, waves, were, exclusively, transverse, and, it, was, young, not, fresnel, who, first, published, the, idea, that, polarization, depends, on, the, orientation, of, a, transverse, vibration, but, these, incomplete, theories, had, not, reconciled, the, nature, of, polarization, with, the, apparent, existence, of, unpolarized, light, that, achievement, was, to, be, fresnel, s, alone, in, a, note, that, buchwald, dates, in, the, summer, of, 1818, fresnel, entertained, the, idea, that, unpolarized, waves, could, have, vibrations, of, the, same, energy, and, obliquity, with, their, orientations, distributed, uniformly, about, the, wave, normal, and, that, the, degree, of, polarization, was, the, degree, of, non, uniformity, in, the, distribution, two, pages, later, he, noted, apparently, for, the, first, time, in, writing, that, his, phase, inversion, rule, and, the, non, interference, of, orthogonally, polarized, beams, would, be, easily, explained, if, the, vibrations, of, fully, polarized, waves, were, perpendicular, to, the, normal, to, the, wave, that, is, purely, transverse, but, if, he, could, account, for, lack, of, polarization, by, averaging, out, the, transverse, component, he, did, not, also, need, to, assume, a, longitudinal, component, it, was, enough, to, suppose, that, light, waves, are, purely, transverse, hence, always, polarized, in, the, sense, of, having, a, particular, transverse, orientation, and, that, the, unpolarized, state, of, natural, or, direct, light, is, due, to, rapid, and, random, variations, in, that, orientation, in, which, case, two, coherent, portions, of, unpolarized, light, will, still, interfere, because, their, orientations, will, be, synchronized, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, fresnel, made, this, last, step, because, there, is, no, relevant, documentation, from, 1820, or, early, 1821, perhaps, because, he, was, too, busy, working, on, lighthouse, lens, prototypes, see, below, but, he, first, published, the, idea, in, a, paper, on, calcul, des, teintes, calculation, of, the, tints, serialized, in, arago, s, annales, for, may, june, and, july, 1821, in, the, first, installment, fresnel, described, direct, unpolarized, light, as, the, rapid, succession, of, systems, of, waves, polarized, in, all, directions, and, gave, what, is, essentially, the, modern, explanation, of, chromatic, polarization, albeit, in, terms, of, the, analogy, between, polarization, and, the, resolution, of, forces, in, a, plane, mentioning, transverse, waves, only, in, a, footnote, the, introduction, of, transverse, waves, into, the, main, argument, was, delayed, to, the, second, installment, in, which, he, revealed, the, suspicion, that, he, and, amp, re, had, harbored, since, 1816, and, the, difficulty, it, raised, he, continued, it, has, only, been, for, a, few, months, that, in, meditating, more, attentively, on, this, subject, i, have, realized, that, it, was, very, probable, that, the, oscillatory, movements, of, light, waves, were, executed, solely, along, the, plane, of, these, waves, for, direct, light, as, well, as, for, polarized, light, according, to, this, new, view, he, wrote, the, act, of, polarization, consists, not, in, creating, these, transverse, movements, but, in, decomposing, them, into, two, fixed, perpendicular, directions, and, in, separating, the, two, components, while, selectionists, could, insist, on, interpreting, fresnel, s, diffraction, integrals, in, terms, of, discrete, countable, rays, they, could, not, do, the, same, with, his, theory, of, polarization, for, a, selectionist, the, state, of, polarization, of, a, beam, concerned, the, distribution, of, orientations, over, the, population, of, rays, and, that, distribution, was, presumed, to, be, static, for, fresnel, the, state, of, polarization, of, a, beam, concerned, the, variation, of, a, displacement, over, time, that, displacement, might, be, constrained, but, was, not, static, and, rays, were, geometric, constructions, not, countable, objects, the, conceptual, gap, between, the, wave, theory, and, selectionism, had, become, unbridgeable, the, other, difficulty, posed, by, pure, transverse, waves, of, course, was, the, apparent, implication, that, the, aether, was, an, elastic, solid, except, that, unlike, other, elastic, solids, it, was, incapable, of, transmitting, longitudinal, waves, the, wave, theory, was, cheap, on, assumptions, but, its, latest, assumption, was, expensive, on, credulity, if, that, assumption, was, to, be, widely, entertained, its, explanatory, power, would, need, to, be, impressive, in, the, second, installment, of, calcul, des, teintes, june, 1821, fresnel, supposed, by, analogy, with, sound, waves, that, the, density, of, the, aether, in, a, refractive, medium, was, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, wave, velocity, and, therefore, directly, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, refractive, index, for, reflection, and, refraction, at, the, surface, between, two, isotropic, media, of, different, indices, fresnel, decomposed, the, transverse, vibrations, into, two, perpendicular, components, now, known, as, the, s, and, p, components, which, are, parallel, to, the, surface, and, the, plane, of, incidence, respectively, in, other, words, the, s, and, p, components, are, respectively, square, and, parallel, to, the, plane, of, incidence, for, the, s, component, fresnel, supposed, that, the, interaction, between, the, two, media, was, analogous, to, an, elastic, collision, and, obtained, a, formula, for, what, we, now, call, the, reflectivity, the, ratio, of, the, reflected, intensity, to, the, incident, intensity, the, predicted, reflectivity, was, non, zero, at, all, angles, the, third, installment, july, 1821, was, a, short, postscript, in, which, fresnel, announced, that, he, had, found, by, a, mechanical, solution, a, formula, for, the, reflectivity, of, the, p, component, which, predicted, that, the, reflectivity, was, zero, at, the, brewster, angle, so, polarization, by, reflection, had, been, accounted, for, but, with, the, proviso, that, the, direction, of, vibration, in, fresnel, s, model, was, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, polarization, as, defined, by, malus, on, the, ensuing, controversy, see, plane, of, polarization, the, technology, of, the, time, did, not, allow, the, s, and, p, reflectivities, to, be, measured, accurately, enough, to, test, fresnel, s, formulae, at, arbitrary, angles, of, incidence, but, the, formulae, could, be, rewritten, in, terms, of, what, we, now, call, the, reflection, coefficient, the, signed, ratio, of, the, reflected, amplitude, to, the, incident, amplitude, then, if, the, plane, of, polarization, of, the, incident, ray, was, at, 45, to, the, plane, of, incidence, the, tangent, of, the, corresponding, angle, for, the, reflected, ray, was, obtainable, from, the, ratio, of, the, two, reflection, coefficients, and, this, angle, could, be, measured, fresnel, had, measured, it, for, a, range, of, angles, of, incidence, for, glass, and, water, and, the, agreement, between, the, calculated, and, measured, angles, was, better, than, 1, 5, in, all, cases, fresnel, gave, details, of, the, mechanical, solution, in, a, memoir, read, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, on, 7, january, 1823, conservation, of, energy, was, combined, with, continuity, of, the, tangential, vibration, at, the, interface, the, resulting, formulae, for, the, reflection, coefficients, and, reflectivities, became, known, as, the, fresnel, equations, the, reflection, coefficients, for, the, s, and, p, polarizations, are, most, succinctly, expressed, as, where, i, displaystyle, i, and, r, displaystyle, r, are, the, angles, of, incidence, and, refraction, these, equations, are, known, respectively, as, fresnel, s, sine, law, and, fresnel, s, tangent, law, by, allowing, the, coefficients, to, be, complex, fresnel, even, accounted, for, the, different, phase, shifts, of, the, s, and, p, components, due, to, total, internal, reflection, this, success, inspired, james, maccullagh, and, augustin, louis, cauchy, beginning, in, 1836, to, analyze, reflection, from, metals, by, using, the, fresnel, equations, with, a, complex, refractive, index, the, same, technique, is, applicable, to, non, metallic, opaque, media, with, these, generalizations, the, fresnel, equations, can, predict, the, appearance, of, a, wide, variety, of, objects, under, illumination, for, example, in, computer, graphics, see, physically, based, rendering, in, a, memoir, dated, 9, december, 1822, fresnel, coined, the, terms, linear, polarization, french, polarisation, rectiligne, for, the, simple, case, in, which, the, perpendicular, components, of, vibration, are, in, phase, or, 180, out, of, phase, circular, polarization, for, the, case, in, which, they, are, of, equal, magnitude, and, a, quarter, cycle, 90, out, of, phase, and, elliptical, polarization, for, other, cases, in, which, the, two, components, have, a, fixed, amplitude, ratio, and, a, fixed, phase, difference, he, then, explained, how, optical, rotation, could, be, understood, as, a, species, of, birefringence, linearly, polarized, light, could, be, resolved, into, two, circularly, polarized, components, rotating, in, opposite, directions, if, these, components, propagated, at, slightly, different, speeds, the, phase, difference, between, them, and, therefore, the, direction, of, their, linearly, polarized, resultant, would, vary, continuously, with, distance, these, concepts, called, for, a, redefinition, of, the, distinction, between, polarized, and, unpolarized, light, before, fresnel, it, was, thought, that, polarization, could, vary, in, direction, and, in, degree, e, g, due, to, variation, in, the, angle, of, reflection, off, a, transparent, body, and, that, it, could, be, a, function, of, color, chromatic, polarization, but, not, that, it, could, vary, in, kind, hence, it, was, thought, that, the, degree, of, polarization, was, the, degree, to, which, the, light, could, be, suppressed, by, an, analyzer, with, the, appropriate, orientation, light, that, had, been, converted, from, linear, to, elliptical, or, circular, polarization, e, g, by, passage, through, a, crystal, lamina, or, by, total, internal, reflection, was, described, as, partly, or, fully, depolarized, because, of, its, behavior, in, an, analyzer, after, fresnel, the, defining, feature, of, polarized, light, was, that, the, perpendicular, components, of, vibration, had, a, fixed, ratio, of, amplitudes, and, a, fixed, difference, in, phase, by, that, definition, elliptically, or, circularly, polarized, light, is, fully, polarized, although, it, cannot, be, fully, suppressed, by, an, analyzer, alone, the, conceptual, gap, between, the, wave, theory, and, selectionism, had, widened, again, by, 1817, it, had, been, discovered, by, brewster, but, not, adequately, reported, 324, that, plane, polarized, light, was, partly, depolarized, by, total, internal, reflection, if, initially, polarized, at, an, acute, angle, to, the, plane, of, incidence, fresnel, rediscovered, this, effect, and, investigated, it, by, including, total, internal, reflection, in, a, chromatic, polarization, experiment, with, the, aid, of, his, first, theory, of, chromatic, polarization, he, found, that, the, apparently, depolarized, light, was, a, mixture, of, components, polarized, parallel, and, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, incidence, and, that, the, total, reflection, introduced, a, phase, difference, between, them, choosing, an, appropriate, angle, of, incidence, not, yet, exactly, specified, gave, a, phase, difference, of, 1, 8, of, a, cycle, 45, two, such, reflections, from, the, parallel, faces, of, two, coupled, prisms, gave, a, phase, difference, of, 1, 4, of, a, cycle, 90, these, findings, were, contained, in, a, memoir, submitted, to, the, acad, mie, on, 10, november, 1817, and, read, a, fortnight, later, an, undated, marginal, note, indicates, that, the, two, coupled, prisms, were, later, replaced, by, a, single, parallelepiped, in, glass, now, known, as, a, fresnel, rhomb, this, was, the, memoir, whose, supplement, dated, january, 1818, contained, the, method, of, superposing, sinusoidal, functions, and, the, restatement, of, malus, s, law, in, terms, of, amplitudes, in, the, same, supplement, fresnel, reported, his, discovery, that, optical, rotation, could, be, emulated, by, passing, the, polarized, light, through, a, fresnel, rhomb, still, in, the, form, of, coupled, prisms, followed, by, an, ordinary, birefringent, lamina, sliced, parallel, to, its, axis, with, the, axis, at, 45, to, the, plane, of, reflection, of, the, fresnel, rhomb, followed, by, a, second, fresnel, rhomb, at, 90, to, the, first, in, a, further, memoir, read, on, 30, march, fresnel, reported, that, if, polarized, light, was, fully, depolarized, by, a, fresnel, rhomb, now, described, as, a, parallelepiped, its, properties, were, not, further, modified, by, a, subsequent, passage, through, an, optically, rotating, medium, or, device, the, connection, between, optical, rotation, and, birefringence, was, further, explained, in, 1822, in, the, memoir, on, elliptical, and, circular, polarization, this, was, followed, by, the, memoir, on, reflection, read, in, january, 1823, in, which, fresnel, quantified, the, phase, shifts, in, total, internal, reflection, and, thence, calculated, the, precise, angle, at, which, a, fresnel, rhomb, should, be, cut, in, order, to, convert, linear, polarization, to, circular, polarization, for, a, refractive, index, of, 1, 51, there, were, two, solutions, about, 48, 6, and, 54, 6, 760, when, light, passes, through, a, slice, of, calcite, cut, perpendicular, to, its, optic, axis, the, difference, between, the, propagation, times, of, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, waves, has, a, second, order, dependence, on, the, angle, of, incidence, if, the, slice, is, observed, in, a, highly, convergent, cone, of, light, that, dependence, becomes, significant, so, that, a, chromatic, polarization, experiment, will, show, a, pattern, of, concentric, rings, but, most, minerals, when, observed, in, this, manner, show, a, more, complicated, pattern, of, rings, involving, two, foci, and, a, lemniscate, curve, as, if, they, had, two, optic, axes, the, two, classes, of, minerals, naturally, become, known, as, uniaxal, and, biaxal, or, in, later, literature, uniaxial, and, biaxial, in, 1813, brewster, observed, the, simple, concentric, pattern, in, beryl, emerald, ruby, c, the, same, pattern, was, later, observed, in, calcite, by, wollaston, biot, and, seebeck, biot, assuming, that, the, concentric, pattern, was, the, general, case, tried, to, calculate, the, colors, with, his, theory, of, chromatic, polarization, and, succeeded, better, for, some, minerals, than, for, others, in, 1818, brewster, belatedly, explained, why, seven, of, the, twelve, minerals, employed, by, biot, had, the, lemniscate, pattern, which, brewster, had, observed, as, early, as, 1812, and, the, minerals, with, the, more, complicated, rings, also, had, a, more, complicated, law, of, refraction, in, a, uniform, crystal, according, to, huygens, s, theory, the, secondary, wavefront, that, expands, from, the, origin, in, unit, time, is, the, ray, velocity, surface, that, is, the, surface, whose, distance, from, the, origin, in, any, direction, is, the, ray, velocity, in, that, direction, in, calcite, this, surface, is, two, sheeted, consisting, of, a, sphere, for, the, ordinary, wave, and, an, oblate, spheroid, for, the, extraordinary, wave, touching, each, other, at, opposite, points, of, a, common, axis, touching, at, the, north, and, south, poles, if, we, may, use, a, geographic, analogy, but, according, to, malus, s, corpuscular, theory, of, double, refraction, the, ray, velocity, was, proportional, to, the, reciprocal, of, that, given, by, huygens, s, theory, in, which, case, the, velocity, law, was, of, the, form, where, v, o, displaystyle, v, o, and, v, e, displaystyle, v, e, were, the, ordinary, and, extraordinary, ray, velocities, according, to, the, corpuscular, theory, and, displaystyle, theta, was, the, angle, between, the, ray, and, the, optic, axis, by, malus, s, definition, the, plane, of, polarization, of, a, ray, was, the, plane, of, the, ray, and, the, optic, axis, if, the, ray, was, ordinary, or, the, perpendicular, plane, containing, the, ray, if, the, ray, was, extraordinary, in, fresnel, s, model, the, direction, of, vibration, was, normal, to, the, plane, of, polarization, hence, for, the, sphere, the, ordinary, wave, the, vibration, was, along, the, lines, of, latitude, continuing, the, geographic, analogy, and, for, the, spheroid, the, extraordinary, wave, the, vibration, was, along, the, lines, of, longitude, on, 29, march, 1819, biot, presented, a, memoir, in, which, he, proposed, simple, generalizations, of, malus, s, rules, for, a, crystal, with, two, axes, and, reported, that, both, generalizations, seemed, to, be, confirmed, by, experiment, for, the, velocity, law, the, squared, sine, was, replaced, by, the, product, of, the, sines, of, the, angles, from, the, ray, to, the, two, axes, biot, s, sine, law, and, for, the, polarization, of, the, ordinary, ray, the, plane, of, the, ray, and, the, axis, was, replaced, by, the, plane, bisecting, the, dihedral, angle, between, the, two, planes, each, of, which, contained, the, ray, and, one, axis, biot, s, dihedral, law, biot, s, laws, meant, that, a, biaxial, crystal, with, axes, at, a, small, angle, cleaved, in, the, plane, of, those, axes, behaved, nearly, like, a, uniaxial, crystal, at, near, normal, incidence, this, was, fortunate, because, gypsum, which, had, been, used, in, chromatic, polarization, experiments, is, biaxial, until, fresnel, turned, his, attention, to, biaxial, birefringence, it, was, assumed, that, one, of, the, two, refractions, was, ordinary, even, in, biaxial, crystals, but, in, a, memoir, submitted, on, 19, november, 1821, fresnel, reported, two, experiments, on, topaz, showing, that, neither, refraction, was, ordinary, in, the, sense, of, satisfying, snell, s, law, that, is, neither, ray, was, the, product, of, spherical, secondary, waves, the, same, memoir, contained, fresnel, s, first, attempt, at, the, biaxial, velocity, law, for, calcite, if, we, interchange, the, equatorial, and, polar, radii, of, huygens, s, oblate, spheroid, while, preserving, the, polar, direction, we, obtain, a, prolate, spheroid, touching, the, sphere, at, the, equator, a, plane, through, the, center, origin, cuts, this, prolate, spheroid, in, an, ellipse, whose, major, and, minor, semi, axes, give, the, magnitudes, of, the, extraordinary, and, ordinary, ray, velocities, in, the, direction, normal, to, the, plane, and, said, fresnel, the, directions, of, their, respective, vibrations, the, direction, of, the, optic, axis, is, the, normal, to, the, plane, for, which, the, ellipse, of, intersection, reduces, to, a, circle, so, for, the, biaxial, case, fresnel, simply, replaced, the, prolate, spheroid, with, a, triaxial, ellipsoid, which, was, to, be, sectioned, by, a, plane, in, the, same, way, in, general, there, would, be, two, planes, passing, through, the, center, of, the, ellipsoid, and, cutting, it, in, a, circle, and, the, normals, to, these, planes, would, give, two, optic, axes, from, the, geometry, fresnel, deduced, biot, s, sine, law, with, the, ray, velocities, replaced, by, their, reciprocals, the, ellipsoid, indeed, gave, the, correct, ray, velocities, although, the, initial, experimental, verification, was, only, approximate, but, it, did, not, give, the, correct, directions, of, vibration, for, the, biaxial, case, or, even, for, the, uniaxial, case, because, the, vibrations, in, fresnel, s, model, were, tangential, to, the, wavefront, which, for, an, extraordinary, ray, is, not, generally, normal, to, the, ray, this, error, which, is, small, if, as, in, most, cases, the, birefringence, is, weak, was, corrected, in, an, extract, that, fresnel, read, to, the, acad, mie, a, week, later, on, 26, november, starting, with, huygens, s, spheroid, fresnel, obtained, a, 4th, degree, surface, which, when, sectioned, by, a, plane, as, above, would, yield, the, wave, normal, velocities, for, a, wavefront, in, that, plane, together, with, their, vibration, directions, for, the, biaxial, case, he, generalized, the, equation, to, obtain, a, surface, with, three, unequal, principal, dimensions, this, he, subsequently, called, the, surface, of, elasticity, but, he, retained, the, earlier, ellipsoid, as, an, approximation, from, which, he, deduced, biot, s, dihedral, law, fresnel, s, initial, derivation, of, the, surface, of, elasticity, had, been, purely, geometric, and, not, deductively, rigorous, his, first, attempt, at, a, mechanical, derivation, contained, in, a, supplement, dated, 13, january, 1822, assumed, that, i, there, were, three, mutually, perpendicular, directions, in, which, a, displacement, produced, a, reaction, in, the, same, direction, ii, the, reaction, was, otherwise, a, linear, function, of, the, displacement, and, iii, the, radius, of, the, surface, in, any, direction, was, the, square, root, of, the, component, in, that, direction, of, the, reaction, to, a, unit, displacement, in, that, direction, the, last, assumption, recognized, the, requirement, that, if, a, wave, was, to, maintain, a, fixed, direction, of, propagation, and, a, fixed, direction, of, vibration, the, reaction, must, not, be, outside, the, plane, of, those, two, directions, in, the, same, supplement, fresnel, considered, how, he, might, find, for, the, biaxial, case, the, secondary, wavefront, that, expands, from, the, origin, in, unit, time, that, is, the, surface, that, reduces, to, huygens, s, sphere, and, spheroid, in, the, uniaxial, case, he, noted, that, this, wave, surface, surface, de, l, onde, is, tangential, to, all, possible, plane, wavefronts, that, could, have, crossed, the, origin, one, unit, of, time, ago, and, he, listed, the, mathematical, conditions, that, it, must, satisfy, but, he, doubted, the, feasibility, of, deriving, the, surface, from, those, conditions, in, a, second, supplement, fresnel, eventually, exploited, two, related, facts, i, the, wave, surface, was, also, the, ray, velocity, surface, which, could, be, obtained, by, sectioning, the, ellipsoid, that, he, had, initially, mistaken, for, the, surface, of, elasticity, and, ii, the, wave, surface, intersected, each, plane, of, symmetry, of, the, ellipsoid, in, two, curves, a, circle, and, an, ellipse, thus, he, found, that, the, wave, surface, is, described, by, the, 4th, degree, equation, where, r, 2, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, displaystyle, r, 2, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, and, a, b, c, displaystyle, a, b, c, are, the, propagation, speeds, in, directions, normal, to, the, coordinate, axes, for, vibrations, along, the, axes, the, ray, and, wave, normal, speeds, being, the, same, in, those, special, cases, later, commentators, 19, put, the, equation, in, the, more, compact, and, memorable, form, earlier, in, the, second, supplement, fresnel, modeled, the, medium, as, an, array, of, point, masses, and, found, that, the, force, displacement, relation, was, described, by, a, symmetric, matrix, confirming, the, existence, of, three, mutually, perpendicular, axes, on, which, the, displacement, produced, a, parallel, force, later, in, the, document, he, noted, that, in, a, biaxial, crystal, unlike, a, uniaxial, crystal, the, directions, in, which, there, is, only, one, wave, normal, velocity, are, not, the, same, as, those, in, which, there, is, only, one, ray, velocity, nowadays, we, refer, to, the, former, directions, as, the, optic, axes, or, binormal, axes, and, the, latter, as, the, ray, axes, or, biradial, axes, see, birefringence, fresnel, s, second, supplement, was, signed, on, 31, march, 1822, and, submitted, the, next, day, less, than, a, year, after, the, publication, of, his, pure, transverse, wave, hypothesis, and, just, less, than, a, year, after, the, demonstration, of, his, prototype, eight, panel, lighthouse, lens, see, below, having, presented, the, pieces, of, his, theory, in, roughly, the, order, of, discovery, fresnel, needed, to, rearrange, the, material, so, as, to, emphasize, the, mechanical, foundations, and, he, still, needed, a, rigorous, treatment, of, biot, s, dihedral, law, he, attended, to, these, matters, in, his, second, memoir, on, double, refraction, published, in, the, recueils, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, for, 1824, this, was, not, actually, printed, until, late, 1827, a, few, months, after, his, death, in, this, work, having, established, the, three, perpendicular, axes, on, which, a, displacement, produces, a, parallel, reaction, and, thence, constructed, the, surface, of, elasticity, he, showed, that, biot, s, dihedral, law, is, exact, provided, that, the, binormals, are, taken, as, the, optic, axes, and, the, wave, normal, direction, as, the, direction, of, propagation, as, early, as, 1822, fresnel, discussed, his, perpendicular, axes, with, cauchy, acknowledging, fresnel, s, influence, cauchy, went, on, to, develop, the, first, rigorous, theory, of, elasticity, of, non, isotropic, solids, 1827, hence, the, first, rigorous, theory, of, transverse, waves, therein, 1830, which, he, promptly, tried, to, apply, to, optics, the, ensuing, difficulties, drove, a, long, competitive, effort, to, find, an, accurate, mechanical, model, of, the, aether, fresnel, s, own, model, was, not, dynamically, rigorous, for, example, it, deduced, the, reaction, to, a, shear, strain, by, considering, the, displacement, of, one, particle, while, all, others, were, fixed, and, it, assumed, that, the, stiffness, determined, the, wave, velocity, as, in, a, stretched, string, whatever, the, direction, of, the, wave, normal, but, it, was, enough, to, enable, the, wave, theory, to, do, what, selectionist, theory, could, not, generate, testable, formulae, covering, a, comprehensive, range, of, optical, phenomena, from, mechanical, assumptions, in, 1815, brewster, reported, that, colors, appear, when, a, slice, of, isotropic, material, placed, between, crossed, polarizers, is, mechanically, stressed, brewster, himself, immediately, and, correctly, attributed, this, phenomenon, to, stress, induced, birefringence, now, known, as, photoelasticity, in, a, memoir, read, in, september, 1822, fresnel, announced, that, he, had, verified, brewster, s, diagnosis, more, directly, by, compressing, a, combination, of, glass, prisms, so, severely, that, one, could, actually, see, a, double, image, through, it, in, his, experiment, fresnel, lined, up, seven, 45, 90, 45, prisms, short, side, to, short, side, with, their, 90, angles, pointing, in, alternating, directions, two, half, prisms, were, added, at, the, ends, to, make, the, whole, assembly, rectangular, the, prisms, were, separated, by, thin, films, of, turpentine, t, r, benthine, to, suppress, internal, reflections, allowing, a, clear, line, of, sight, along, the, row, when, the, four, prisms, with, similar, orientations, were, compressed, in, a, vise, across, the, line, of, sight, an, object, viewed, through, the, assembly, produced, two, images, with, perpendicular, polarizations, with, an, apparent, spacing, of, 1, 5, mm, at, one, metre, at, the, end, of, that, memoir, fresnel, predicted, that, if, the, compressed, prisms, were, replaced, by, unstressed, monocrystalline, quartz, prisms, with, matching, directions, of, optical, rotation, and, with, their, optic, axes, aligned, along, the, row, an, object, seen, by, looking, along, the, common, optic, axis, would, give, two, images, which, would, seem, unpolarized, when, viewed, through, an, analyzer, but, when, viewed, through, a, fresnel, rhomb, would, be, polarized, at, 45, to, the, plane, of, reflection, of, the, rhomb, indicating, that, they, were, initially, circularly, polarized, in, opposite, directions, this, would, show, directly, that, optical, rotation, is, a, form, of, birefringence, in, the, memoir, of, december, 1822, in, which, he, introduced, the, term, circular, polarization, he, reported, that, he, had, confirmed, this, prediction, using, only, one, 14, 152, 14, prism, and, two, glass, half, prisms, but, he, obtained, a, wider, separation, of, the, images, by, replacing, the, glass, half, prism, with, quartz, half, prisms, whose, rotation, was, opposite, to, that, of, the, 14, 152, 14, prism, he, added, in, passing, that, one, could, further, increase, the, separation, by, increasing, the, number, of, prisms, for, the, supplement, to, riffault, s, translation, of, thomson, s, system, of, chemistry, fresnel, was, chosen, to, contribute, the, article, on, light, the, resulting, 137, page, essay, titled, de, la, lumi, re, on, light, was, apparently, finished, in, june, 1821, and, published, by, february, 1822, with, sections, covering, the, nature, of, light, diffraction, thin, film, interference, reflection, and, refraction, double, refraction, and, polarization, chromatic, polarization, and, modification, of, polarization, by, reflection, it, made, a, comprehensive, case, for, the, wave, theory, to, a, readership, that, was, not, restricted, to, physicists, to, examine, fresnel, s, first, memoir, and, supplements, on, double, refraction, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, appointed, amp, re, arago, fourier, and, poisson, their, report, of, which, arago, was, clearly, the, main, author, was, delivered, at, the, meeting, of, 19, august, 1822, then, in, the, words, of, mile, verdet, as, translated, by, ivor, grattan, guinness, immediately, after, the, reading, of, the, report, laplace, took, the, floor, and, proclaimed, the, exceptional, importance, of, the, work, which, had, just, been, reported, he, congratulated, the, author, on, his, steadfastness, and, his, sagacity, which, had, led, him, to, discover, a, law, which, had, escaped, the, cleverest, and, anticipating, somewhat, the, judgement, of, posterity, declared, that, he, placed, these, researches, above, everything, that, had, been, communicated, to, the, acad, mie, for, a, long, time, whether, laplace, was, announcing, his, conversion, to, the, wave, theory, at, the, age, of, 73, is, uncertain, grattan, guinness, entertained, the, idea, buchwald, noting, that, arago, failed, to, explain, that, the, ellipsoid, of, elasticity, did, not, give, the, correct, planes, of, polarization, suggests, that, laplace, may, have, merely, regarded, fresnel, s, theory, as, a, successful, generalization, of, malus, s, ray, velocity, law, embracing, biot, s, laws, in, the, following, year, poisson, who, did, not, sign, arago, s, report, disputed, the, possibility, of, transverse, waves, in, the, aether, starting, from, assumed, equations, of, motion, of, a, fluid, medium, he, noted, that, they, did, not, give, the, correct, results, for, partial, reflection, and, double, refraction, as, if, that, were, fresnel, s, problem, rather, than, his, own, and, that, the, predicted, waves, even, if, they, were, initially, transverse, became, more, longitudinal, as, they, propagated, in, reply, fresnel, noted, inter, alia, that, the, equations, in, which, poisson, put, so, much, faith, did, not, even, predict, viscosity, the, implication, was, clear, given, that, the, behavior, of, light, had, not, been, satisfactorily, explained, except, by, transverse, waves, it, was, not, the, responsibility, of, the, wave, theorists, to, abandon, transverse, waves, in, deference, to, pre, conceived, notions, about, the, aether, rather, it, was, the, responsibility, of, the, aether, modelers, to, produce, a, model, that, accommodated, transverse, waves, according, to, robert, h, silliman, poisson, eventually, accepted, the, wave, theory, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1840, among, the, french, poisson, s, reluctance, was, an, exception, according, to, eugene, frankel, in, paris, no, debate, on, the, issue, seems, to, have, taken, place, after, 1825, indeed, almost, the, entire, generation, of, physicists, and, mathematicians, who, came, to, maturity, in, the, 1820s, pouillet, savart, lam, navier, liouville, cauchy, seem, to, have, adopted, the, theory, immediately, fresnel, s, other, prominent, french, opponent, biot, appeared, to, take, a, neutral, position, in, 1830, and, eventually, accepted, the, wave, theory, possibly, by, 1846, and, certainly, by, 1858, in, 1826, the, british, astronomer, john, herschel, who, was, working, on, a, book, length, article, on, light, for, the, encyclop, dia, metropolitana, addressed, three, questions, to, fresnel, concerning, double, refraction, partial, reflection, and, their, relation, to, polarization, the, resulting, article, titled, simply, light, was, highly, sympathetic, to, the, wave, theory, although, not, entirely, free, of, selectionist, language, it, was, circulating, privately, by, 1828, and, was, published, in, 1830, meanwhile, young, s, translation, of, fresnel, s, de, la, lumi, re, was, published, in, installments, from, 1827, to, 1829, george, biddell, airy, the, former, lucasian, professor, at, cambridge, and, future, astronomer, royal, unreservedly, accepted, the, wave, theory, by, 1831, in, 1834, he, famously, calculated, the, diffraction, pattern, of, a, circular, aperture, from, the, wave, theory, thereby, explaining, the, limited, angular, resolution, of, a, perfect, telescope, see, airy, disk, by, the, end, of, the, 1830s, the, only, prominent, british, physicist, who, held, out, against, the, wave, theory, was, brewster, whose, objections, included, the, difficulty, of, explaining, photochemical, effects, and, in, his, opinion, dispersion, a, german, translation, of, de, la, lumi, re, was, published, in, installments, in, 1825, and, 1828, the, wave, theory, was, adopted, by, fraunhofer, in, the, early, 1820s, and, by, franz, ernst, neumann, in, the, 1830s, and, then, began, to, find, favor, in, german, textbooks, the, economy, of, assumptions, under, the, wave, theory, was, emphasized, by, william, whewell, in, his, history, of, the, inductive, sciences, first, published, in, 1837, in, the, corpuscular, system, every, new, class, of, facts, requires, a, new, supposition, whereas, in, the, wave, system, a, hypothesis, devised, in, order, to, explain, one, phenomenon, is, then, found, to, explain, or, predict, others, in, the, corpuscular, system, there, is, no, unexpected, success, no, happy, coincidence, no, convergence, of, principles, from, remote, quarters, but, in, the, wave, system, all, tends, to, unity, and, simplicity, hence, in, 1850, when, foucault, and, fizeau, found, by, experiment, that, light, travels, more, slowly, in, water, than, in, air, in, accordance, with, the, wave, explanation, of, refraction, and, contrary, to, the, corpuscular, explanation, the, result, came, as, no, surprise, fresnel, was, not, the, first, person, to, focus, a, lighthouse, beam, using, a, lens, that, distinction, apparently, belongs, to, the, london, glass, cutter, thomas, rogers, whose, first, lenses, 53, cm, in, diameter, and, 14, cm, thick, at, the, center, were, installed, at, the, old, lower, lighthouse, at, portland, bill, in, 1789, further, samples, were, installed, in, about, half, a, dozen, other, locations, by, 1804, but, much, of, the, light, was, wasted, by, absorption, in, the, glass, nor, was, fresnel, the, first, to, suggest, replacing, a, convex, lens, with, a, series, of, concentric, annular, prisms, to, reduce, weight, and, absorption, in, 1748, count, buffon, proposed, grinding, such, prisms, as, steps, in, a, single, piece, of, glass, in, 1790, the, marquis, de, condorcet, suggested, that, it, would, be, easier, to, make, the, annular, sections, separately, and, assemble, them, on, a, frame, but, even, that, was, impractical, at, the, time, these, designs, were, intended, not, for, lighthouses, but, for, burning, glasses, 609, brewster, however, proposed, a, system, similar, to, condorcet, s, in, 1811, and, by, 1820, was, advocating, its, use, in, british, lighthouses, meanwhile, on, 21, june, 1819, fresnel, was, temporarily, seconded, by, the, commission, des, phares, commission, of, lighthouses, on, the, recommendation, of, arago, a, member, of, the, commission, since, 1813, to, review, possible, improvements, in, lighthouse, illumination, the, commission, had, been, established, by, napoleon, in, 1811, and, placed, under, the, corps, des, ponts, fresnel, s, employer, by, the, end, of, august, 1819, unaware, of, the, buffon, condorcet, brewster, proposal, fresnel, made, his, first, presentation, to, the, commission, recommending, what, he, called, lentilles, chelons, lenses, by, steps, to, replace, the, reflectors, then, in, use, which, reflected, only, about, half, of, the, incident, light, one, of, the, assembled, commissioners, jacques, charles, recalled, buffon, s, suggestion, leaving, fresnel, embarrassed, for, having, again, broken, through, an, open, door, but, whereas, buffon, s, version, was, biconvex, and, in, one, piece, fresnel, s, was, plano, convex, and, made, of, multiple, prisms, for, easier, construction, with, an, official, budget, of, 500, francs, fresnel, approached, three, manufacturers, the, third, fran, ois, soleil, produced, the, prototype, finished, in, march, 1820, it, had, a, square, lens, panel, 55, cm, on, a, side, containing, 97, polygonal, not, annular, prisms, and, so, impressed, the, commission, that, fresnel, was, asked, for, a, full, eight, panel, version, this, model, completed, a, year, later, in, spite, of, insufficient, funding, had, panels, 76, cm, square, in, a, public, spectacle, on, the, evening, of, 13, april, 1821, it, was, demonstrated, by, comparison, with, the, most, recent, reflectors, which, it, suddenly, rendered, obsolete, fresnel, s, next, lens, was, a, rotating, apparatus, with, eight, bull, s, eye, panels, made, in, annular, arcs, by, saint, gobain, giving, eight, rotating, beams, to, be, seen, by, mariners, as, a, periodic, flash, above, and, behind, each, main, panel, was, a, smaller, sloping, bull, s, eye, panel, of, trapezoidal, outline, with, trapezoidal, elements, this, refracted, the, light, to, a, sloping, plane, mirror, which, then, reflected, it, horizontally, 7, degrees, ahead, of, the, main, beam, increasing, the, duration, of, the, flash, below, the, main, panels, were, 128, small, mirrors, arranged, in, four, rings, stacked, like, the, slats, of, a, louver, or, venetian, blind, each, ring, shaped, as, a, frustum, of, a, cone, reflected, the, light, to, the, horizon, giving, a, fainter, steady, light, between, the, flashes, the, official, test, conducted, on, the, unfinished, arc, de, triomphe, on, 20, august, 1822, was, witnessed, by, the, commission, and, by, louis, xviii, and, his, entourage, from, 32, km, away, the, apparatus, was, stored, at, bordeaux, for, the, winter, and, then, reassembled, at, cordouan, lighthouse, under, fresnel, s, supervision, on, 25, july, 1823, the, world, s, first, lighthouse, fresnel, lens, was, lit, soon, afterwards, fresnel, started, coughing, up, blood, in, may, 1824, fresnel, was, promoted, to, secretary, of, the, commission, des, phares, becoming, the, first, member, of, that, body, to, draw, a, salary, albeit, in, the, concurrent, role, of, engineer, in, chief, he, was, also, an, examiner, not, a, teacher, at, the, cole, polytechnique, since, 1821, but, poor, health, long, hours, during, the, examination, season, and, anxiety, about, judging, others, induced, him, to, resign, that, post, in, late, 1824, to, save, his, energy, for, his, lighthouse, work, in, the, same, year, he, designed, the, first, fixed, lens, for, spreading, light, evenly, around, the, horizon, while, minimizing, waste, above, or, below, ideally, the, curved, refracting, surfaces, would, be, segments, of, toroids, about, a, common, vertical, axis, so, that, the, dioptric, panel, would, look, like, a, cylindrical, drum, if, this, was, supplemented, by, reflecting, catoptric, rings, above, and, below, the, refracting, dioptric, parts, the, entire, apparatus, would, look, like, a, beehive, the, second, fresnel, lens, to, enter, service, was, indeed, a, fixed, lens, of, third, order, installed, at, dunkirk, by, 1, february, 1825, however, due, to, the, difficulty, of, fabricating, large, toroidal, prisms, this, apparatus, had, a, 16, sided, polygonal, plan, in, 1825, fresnel, extended, his, fixed, lens, design, by, adding, a, rotating, array, outside, the, fixed, array, each, panel, of, the, rotating, array, was, to, refract, part, of, the, fixed, light, from, a, horizontal, fan, into, a, narrow, beam, also, in, 1825, fresnel, unveiled, the, carte, des, phares, lighthouse, map, calling, for, a, system, of, 51, lighthouses, plus, smaller, harbor, lights, in, a, hierarchy, of, lens, sizes, called, orders, the, first, order, being, the, largest, with, different, characteristics, to, facilitate, recognition, a, constant, light, from, a, fixed, lens, one, flash, per, minute, from, a, rotating, lens, with, eight, panels, and, two, per, minute, sixteen, panels, in, late, 1825, to, reduce, the, loss, of, light, in, the, reflecting, elements, fresnel, proposed, to, replace, each, mirror, with, a, catadioptric, prism, through, which, the, light, would, travel, by, refraction, through, the, first, surface, then, total, internal, reflection, off, the, second, surface, then, refraction, through, the, third, surface, the, result, was, the, lighthouse, lens, as, we, now, know, it, in, 1826, he, assembled, a, small, model, for, use, on, the, canal, saint, martin, but, he, did, not, live, to, see, a, full, sized, version, the, first, fixed, lens, with, toroidal, prisms, was, a, first, order, apparatus, designed, by, the, scottish, engineer, alan, stevenson, under, the, guidance, of, l, onor, fresnel, and, fabricated, by, isaac, cookson, co, from, french, glass, it, entered, service, at, the, isle, of, may, in, 1836, the, first, large, catadioptric, lenses, were, fixed, third, order, lenses, made, in, 1842, for, the, lighthouses, at, gravelines, and, le, vierge, the, first, fully, catadioptric, first, order, lens, installed, at, ailly, in, 1852, gave, eight, rotating, beams, assisted, by, eight, catadioptric, panels, at, the, top, to, lengthen, the, flashes, plus, a, fixed, light, from, below, the, first, fully, catadioptric, lens, with, purely, revolving, beams, also, of, first, order, was, installed, at, saint, cl, ment, des, baleines, in, 1854, and, marked, the, completion, of, augustin, fresnel, s, original, carte, des, phares, production, of, one, piece, stepped, dioptric, lenses, roughly, as, envisaged, by, buffon, became, practical, in, 1852, when, john, l, gilliland, of, the, brooklyn, flint, glass, company, patented, a, method, of, making, such, lenses, from, press, molded, glass, by, the, 1950s, the, substitution, of, plastic, for, glass, made, it, economic, to, use, fine, stepped, fresnel, lenses, as, condensers, in, overhead, projectors, still, finer, steps, can, be, found, in, low, cost, plastic, sheet, magnifiers, fresnel, was, elected, to, the, soci, t, philomathique, de, paris, in, april, 1819, and, in, 1822, became, one, of, the, editors, of, the, soci, t, s, bulletin, des, sciences, as, early, as, may, 1817, at, arago, s, suggestion, fresnel, applied, for, membership, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, but, received, only, one, vote, the, successful, candidate, on, that, occasion, was, joseph, fourier, in, november, 1822, fourier, s, elevation, to, permanent, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, created, a, vacancy, in, the, physics, section, which, was, filled, in, february, 1823, by, pierre, louis, dulong, with, 36, votes, to, fresnel, s, 20, but, in, may, 1823, after, another, vacancy, was, left, by, the, death, of, jacques, charles, fresnel, s, election, was, unanimous, in, 1824, fresnel, was, made, a, chevalier, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, knight, of, the, legion, of, honour, meanwhile, in, britain, the, wave, theory, was, yet, to, take, hold, fresnel, wrote, to, thomas, young, in, november, 1824, saying, in, part, i, am, far, from, denying, the, value, that, i, attach, to, the, praise, of, english, scholars, or, pretending, that, they, would, not, have, flattered, me, agreeably, but, for, a, long, time, this, sensibility, or, vanity, which, is, called, the, love, of, glory, has, been, much, blunted, in, me, i, work, far, less, to, capture, the, public, s, votes, than, to, obtain, an, inner, approbation, which, has, always, been, the, sweetest, reward, of, my, efforts, doubtless, i, have, often, needed, the, sting, of, vanity, to, excite, me, to, pursue, my, researches, in, moments, of, disgust, or, discouragement, but, all, the, compliments, i, received, from, mm, arago, laplace, and, biot, never, gave, me, as, much, pleasure, as, the, discovery, of, a, theoretical, truth, and, the, confirmation, of, my, calculations, by, experiment, but, the, praise, of, english, scholars, soon, followed, on, 9, june, 1825, fresnel, was, made, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, of, london, in, 1827, he, was, awarded, the, society, s, rumford, medal, for, the, year, 1824, for, his, development, of, the, undulatory, theory, as, applied, to, the, phenomena, of, polarized, light, and, for, his, various, important, discoveries, in, physical, optics, a, monument, to, fresnel, at, his, birthplace, see, above, was, dedicated, on, 14, september, 1884, with, a, speech, by, jules, jamin, permanent, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, fresnel, is, among, the, 72, names, embossed, on, the, eiffel, tower, on, the, south, east, side, fourth, from, the, left, in, the, 19th, century, as, every, lighthouse, in, france, acquired, a, fresnel, lens, every, one, acquired, a, bust, of, fresnel, seemingly, watching, over, the, coastline, that, he, had, made, safer, the, lunar, features, promontorium, fresnel, and, rimae, fresnel, were, later, named, after, him, fresnel, s, health, which, had, always, been, poor, deteriorated, in, the, winter, of, 1822, 1823, increasing, the, urgency, of, his, original, research, and, in, part, preventing, him, from, contributing, an, article, on, polarization, and, double, refraction, for, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, memoirs, on, circular, and, elliptical, polarization, and, optical, rotation, and, on, the, detailed, derivation, of, the, fresnel, equations, and, their, application, to, total, internal, reflection, date, from, this, period, in, the, spring, he, recovered, enough, in, his, own, view, to, supervise, the, lens, installation, at, cordouan, soon, afterwards, it, became, clear, that, his, condition, was, tuberculosis, in, 1824, he, was, advised, that, if, he, wanted, to, live, longer, he, needed, to, scale, back, his, activities, perceiving, his, lighthouse, work, to, be, his, most, important, duty, he, resigned, as, an, examiner, at, the, cole, polytechnique, and, closed, his, scientific, notebooks, his, last, note, to, the, acad, mie, read, on, 13, june, 1825, described, the, first, radiometer, and, attributed, the, observed, repulsive, force, to, a, temperature, difference, although, his, fundamental, research, ceased, his, advocacy, did, not, as, late, as, august, or, september, 1826, he, found, the, time, to, answer, herschel, s, queries, on, the, wave, theory, it, was, herschel, who, recommended, fresnel, for, the, royal, society, s, rumford, medal, fresnel, s, cough, worsened, in, the, winter, of, 1826, 1827, leaving, him, too, ill, to, return, to, mathieu, in, the, spring, the, acad, mie, meeting, of, 30, april, 1827, was, the, last, that, he, attended, in, early, june, he, was, carried, to, ville, d, avray, 12, kilometres, 7, 5, mi, west, of, paris, there, his, mother, joined, him, on, 6, july, arago, arrived, to, deliver, the, rumford, medal, sensing, arago, s, distress, fresnel, whispered, that, the, most, beautiful, crown, means, little, when, it, is, laid, on, the, grave, of, a, friend, fresnel, did, not, have, the, strength, to, reply, to, the, royal, society, he, died, eight, days, later, on, bastille, day, he, is, buried, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, paris, the, inscription, on, his, headstone, is, partly, eroded, away, the, legible, part, says, when, translated, to, the, memory, of, augustin, jean, fresnel, member, of, the, institute, of, france, fresnel, s, second, memoir, on, double, refraction, was, not, printed, until, late, 1827, a, few, months, after, his, death, until, then, the, best, published, source, on, his, work, on, double, refraction, was, an, extract, of, that, memoir, printed, in, 1822, his, final, treatment, of, partial, reflection, and, total, internal, reflection, read, to, the, acad, mie, in, january, 1823, was, thought, to, be, lost, until, it, was, rediscovered, among, the, papers, of, the, deceased, joseph, fourier, 1768, 1830, and, was, printed, in, 1831, until, then, it, was, known, chiefly, through, an, extract, printed, in, 1823, and, 1825, the, memoir, introducing, the, parallelepiped, form, of, the, fresnel, rhomb, read, in, march, 1818, was, mislaid, until, 1846, and, then, attracted, such, interest, that, it, was, soon, republished, in, english, most, of, fresnel, s, writings, on, polarized, light, before, 1821, including, his, first, theory, of, chromatic, polarization, submitted, 7, october, 1816, and, the, crucial, supplement, of, january, 1818, were, not, published, in, full, until, his, oeuvres, compl, tes, complete, works, began, to, appear, in, 1866, the, supplement, of, july, 1816, proposing, the, efficacious, ray, and, reporting, the, famous, double, mirror, experiment, met, the, same, fate, as, did, the, first, memoir, on, double, refraction, publication, of, fresnel, s, collected, works, was, itself, delayed, by, the, deaths, of, successive, editors, the, task, was, initially, entrusted, to, f, lix, savary, who, died, in, 1841, it, was, restarted, twenty, years, later, by, the, ministry, of, public, instruction, of, the, three, editors, eventually, named, in, the, oeuvres, s, narmont, died, in, 1862, verdet, in, 1866, and, l, onor, fresnel, in, 1869, by, which, time, only, two, of, the, three, volumes, had, appeared, at, the, beginning, of, vol, 3, 1870, the, completion, of, the, project, is, described, in, a, long, footnote, by, j, lissajous, not, included, in, the, oeuvres, are, two, short, notes, by, fresnel, on, magnetism, which, were, discovered, among, amp, re, s, manuscripts, 104, in, response, to, rsted, s, discovery, of, electromagnetism, in, 1820, amp, re, initially, supposed, that, the, field, of, a, permanent, magnet, was, due, to, a, macroscopic, circulating, current, fresnel, suggested, instead, that, there, was, a, microscopic, current, circulating, around, each, particle, of, the, magnet, in, his, first, note, he, argued, that, microscopic, currents, unlike, macroscopic, currents, would, explain, why, a, hollow, cylindrical, magnet, does, not, lose, its, magnetism, when, cut, longitudinally, in, his, second, note, dated, 5, july, 1821, he, further, argued, that, a, macroscopic, current, had, the, counterfactual, implication, that, a, permanent, magnet, should, be, hot, whereas, microscopic, currents, circulating, around, the, molecules, might, avoid, the, heating, mechanism, 101, 104, he, was, not, to, know, that, the, fundamental, units, of, permanent, magnetism, are, even, smaller, than, molecules, see, electron, magnetic, moment, the, two, notes, together, with, amp, re, s, acknowledgment, were, eventually, published, in, 1885, fresnel, s, essay, r, veries, of, 1814, has, not, survived, the, article, sur, les, diff, rents, syst, mes, relatifs, la, th, orie, de, la, lumi, re, on, the, different, systems, relating, to, the, theory, of, light, which, fresnel, wrote, for, the, newly, launched, english, journal, european, review, was, received, by, the, publisher, s, agent, in, paris, in, september, 1824, the, journal, failed, before, fresnel, s, contribution, could, be, published, fresnel, tried, unsuccessfully, to, recover, the, manuscript, the, editors, of, his, collected, works, were, unable, to, find, it, and, concluded, that, it, was, probably, lost, in, 1810, arago, found, experimentally, that, the, degree, of, refraction, of, starlight, does, not, depend, on, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, motion, relative, to, the, line, of, sight, in, 1818, fresnel, showed, that, this, result, could, be, explained, by, the, wave, theory, on, the, hypothesis, that, if, an, object, with, refractive, index, n, displaystyle, n, moved, at, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, relative, to, the, external, aether, taken, as, stationary, then, the, velocity, of, light, inside, the, object, gained, the, additional, component, v, 1, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, v, 1, 1, n, 2, he, supported, that, hypothesis, by, supposing, that, if, the, density, of, the, external, aether, was, taken, as, unity, the, density, of, the, internal, aether, was, n, 2, displaystyle, n, 2, of, which, the, excess, namely, n, 2, 1, displaystyle, n, 2, 1, was, dragged, along, at, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, whence, the, average, velocity, of, the, internal, aether, was, v, 1, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, v, 1, 1, n, 2, the, factor, in, parentheses, which, fresnel, originally, expressed, in, terms, of, wavelengths, became, known, as, the, fresnel, drag, coefficient, see, aether, drag, hypothesis, in, his, analysis, of, double, refraction, fresnel, supposed, that, the, different, refractive, indices, in, different, directions, within, the, same, medium, were, due, to, a, directional, variation, in, elasticity, not, density, because, the, concept, of, mass, per, unit, volume, is, not, directional, but, in, his, treatment, of, partial, reflection, he, supposed, that, the, different, refractive, indices, of, different, media, were, due, to, different, aether, densities, not, different, elasticities, the, analogy, between, light, waves, and, transverse, waves, in, elastic, solids, does, not, predict, dispersion, that, is, the, frequency, dependence, of, the, speed, of, propagation, which, enables, prisms, to, produce, spectra, and, causes, lenses, to, suffer, from, chromatic, aberration, fresnel, in, de, la, lumi, re, and, in, the, second, supplement, to, his, first, memoir, on, double, refraction, suggested, that, dispersion, could, be, accounted, for, if, the, particles, of, the, medium, exerted, forces, on, each, other, over, distances, that, were, significant, fractions, of, a, wavelength, later, more, than, once, fresnel, referred, to, the, demonstration, of, this, result, as, being, contained, in, a, note, appended, to, his, second, memoir, on, double, refraction, no, such, note, appeared, in, print, and, the, relevant, manuscripts, found, after, his, death, showed, only, that, around, 1824, he, was, comparing, refractive, indices, measured, by, fraunhofer, with, a, theoretical, formula, the, meaning, of, which, was, not, fully, explained, in, the, 1830s, fresnel, s, suggestion, was, taken, up, by, cauchy, baden, powell, and, philip, kelland, and, it, was, found, to, be, tolerably, consistent, with, the, variation, of, refractive, indices, with, wavelength, over, the, visible, spectrum, for, a, variety, of, transparent, media, see, cauchy, s, equation, these, investigations, were, enough, to, show, that, the, wave, theory, was, at, least, compatible, with, dispersion, if, the, model, of, dispersion, was, to, be, accurate, over, a, wider, range, of, frequencies, it, needed, to, be, modified, so, as, to, take, account, of, resonances, within, the, medium, see, sellmeier, equation, the, analytical, complexity, of, fresnel, s, derivation, of, the, ray, velocity, surface, was, an, implicit, challenge, to, find, a, shorter, path, to, the, result, this, was, answered, by, maccullagh, in, 1830, and, by, william, rowan, hamilton, in, 1832, within, a, century, of, fresnel, s, initial, stepped, lens, proposal, more, than, 10, 000, lights, with, fresnel, lenses, were, protecting, lives, and, property, around, the, world, concerning, the, other, benefits, the, science, historian, theresa, h, levitt, has, remarked, everywhere, i, looked, the, story, repeated, itself, the, moment, a, fresnel, lens, appeared, at, a, location, was, the, moment, that, region, became, linked, into, the, world, economy, in, the, history, of, physical, optics, fresnel, s, successful, revival, of, the, wave, theory, nominates, him, as, the, pivotal, figure, between, newton, who, held, that, light, consisted, of, corpuscles, and, james, clerk, maxwell, who, established, that, light, waves, are, electromagnetic, whereas, albert, einstein, described, maxwell, s, work, as, the, most, profound, and, the, most, fruitful, that, physics, has, experienced, since, the, time, of, newton, commentators, of, the, era, between, fresnel, and, maxwell, made, similarly, strong, statements, about, fresnel, the, theory, of, fresnel, to, which, i, now, proceed, and, which, not, only, embraces, all, the, known, phenomena, but, has, even, outstripped, observation, and, predicted, consequences, which, were, afterwards, fully, verified, will, i, am, persuaded, be, regarded, as, the, finest, generalization, in, physical, science, which, has, been, made, since, the, discovery, of, universal, gravitation, it, would, perhaps, be, too, fanciful, to, attempt, to, establish, a, parallelism, between, the, prominent, persons, who, figure, in, these, two, histories, if, we, were, to, do, this, we, must, consider, huyghens, and, hooke, as, standing, in, the, place, of, copernicus, since, like, him, they, announced, the, true, theory, but, left, it, to, a, future, age, to, give, it, development, and, mechanical, confirmation, malus, and, brewster, grouping, them, together, correspond, to, tycho, brahe, and, kepler, laborious, in, accumulating, observations, inventive, and, happy, in, discovering, laws, of, phenomena, and, young, and, fresnel, combined, make, up, the, newton, of, optical, science, what, whewell, called, the, true, theory, has, since, undergone, two, major, revisions, the, first, by, maxwell, specified, the, physical, fields, whose, variations, constitute, the, waves, of, light, without, the, benefit, of, this, knowledge, fresnel, managed, to, construct, the, world, s, first, coherent, theory, of, light, showing, in, retrospect, that, his, methods, are, applicable, to, multiple, types, of, waves, the, second, revision, initiated, by, einstein, s, explanation, of, the, photoelectric, effect, supposed, that, the, energy, of, light, waves, was, divided, into, quanta, which, were, eventually, identified, with, particles, called, photons, but, photons, did, not, exactly, correspond, to, newton, s, corpuscles, for, example, newton, s, explanation, of, ordinary, refraction, required, the, corpuscles, to, travel, faster, in, media, of, higher, refractive, index, which, photons, do, not, neither, did, photons, displace, waves, rather, they, led, to, the, paradox, of, wave, particle, duality, moreover, the, phenomena, studied, by, fresnel, which, included, nearly, all, the, optical, phenomena, known, at, his, time, are, still, most, easily, explained, in, terms, of, the, wave, nature, of, light, so, it, was, that, as, late, as, 1927, the, astronomer, eug, ne, michel, antoniadi, declared, fresnel, to, be, the, dominant, figure, in, optics
