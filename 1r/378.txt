was, the, city, s, 16th, largest, taxpayer, in, 1833, in, his, unfinished, biography, from, skien, to, rome, henrik, ibsen, wrote, about, the, skien, of, his, childhood, in, my, childhood, skien, was, an, extremely, joyful, and, festive, town, quite, the, opposite, of, what, it, would, later, become, many, highly, cultured, prosperous, families, at, that, time, lived, partly, in, the, city, itself, partly, on, large, farms, in, the, area, close, or, more, remote, kinship, connected, most, of, these, families, amongst, themselves, and, balls, dinner, parties, and, musical, soir, es, came, one, after, another, in, rapid, succession, both, during, winters, and, summers, visits, from, strangers, were, almost, a, constant, occurrence, at, our, spacious, farmhouse, and, especially, around, christmastime, and, the, market, days, our, townhouse, was, full, and, the, table, was, set, from, morning, to, nightfall, haave, writes, that, the, sources, who, knew, henrik, in, childhood, described, him, as, a, boy, who, was, pampered, by, his, father, who, enjoyed, being, creative, in, solitude, and, who, provoked, peers, with, his, superiority, and, arrogance, henrik, engaged, in, model, theater, which, was, particularly, popular, among, boys, from, bourgeois, homes, in, europe, in, the, early, 1800s, in, contrast, to, his, father, who, was, described, as, sociable, and, playful, with, a, cheerful, and, friendly, demeanor, henrik, was, depicted, as, a, more, introverted, personality, this, trait, was, said, to, be, shared, with, several, relatives, in, the, paus, family, and, later, with, his, own, son, sigurd, johan, kielland, bergwitz, claimed, that, it, is, with, the, paus, family, that, henrik, ibsen, has, the, most, pronounced, temperament, traits, in, common, referring, to, the, paus, side, of, the, family, hedvig, ibsen, remarked, we, belong, to, a, silent, family, playfully, echoing, the, similarity, between, taus, silent, and, paus, one, of, the, cudrio, sisters, from, the, neighboring, farm, who, knew, henrik, ibsen, in, childhood, said, he, was, immensely, cunning, and, malicious, and, he, even, beat, us, but, when, he, grew, up, he, became, incredibly, handsome, yet, no, one, liked, him, because, he, was, so, malicious, no, one, wanted, to, be, with, him, when, henrik, ibsen, was, around, seven, years, old, his, father, s, fortunes, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, and, in, 1835, the, family, was, forced, to, sell, altenburgg, rden, the, following, year, they, moved, to, their, stately, summer, home, and, farm, venst, p, outside, of, the, city, they, were, still, relatively, affluent, had, four, servants, and, socialised, with, other, members, of, the, skien, elite, e, g, through, lavish, parties, their, closest, neighbours, on, southern, venst, p, were, former, shipowner, and, mayor, of, skien, ulrich, frederik, cudrio, and, his, family, who, also, had, been, forced, to, sell, their, townhouse, in, 1843, after, henrik, left, home, the, ibsen, family, moved, to, a, townhouse, at, snipetorp, owned, by, knud, ibsen, s, half, brother, and, former, apprentice, christopher, blom, paus, who, had, established, himself, as, an, independent, merchant, in, skien, in, 1836, and, who, eventually, became, one, of, the, city, s, leading, shipowners, knud, continued, to, struggle, to, maintain, his, business, and, had, some, success, in, the, 1840s, but, in, the, 1850s, his, business, ventures, and, professional, activities, came, to, an, end, and, he, became, reliant, on, support, from, his, successful, younger, half, brothers, ibsen, scholar, ellen, rees, notes, that, historical, and, biographical, research, into, ibsen, s, life, in, the, 21st, century, has, been, marked, by, a, revolution, that, has, debunked, numerous, myths, previously, taken, for, granted, older, ibsen, historiography, has, often, claimed, that, knud, ibsen, experienced, financial, ruin, and, became, an, alcoholic, tyrant, that, the, family, lost, contact, with, the, elite, it, had, belonged, to, and, that, this, had, a, strong, influence, on, henrik, ibsen, s, biography, and, work, newer, ibsen, scholarship, in, particular, jon, nygaard, s, book, on, ibsen, s, wider, social, milieu, and, ancestry, and, j, rgen, haave, s, book, the, ibsen, family, familien, ibsen, has, refuted, such, claims, and, haave, has, pointed, out, that, older, biographical, works, have, uncritically, repeated, numerous, unfounded, myths, about, both, of, ibsen, s, parents, and, about, the, playwright, s, childhood, and, background, in, general, haave, points, out, that, knud, ibsen, s, economic, problems, in, the, 1830s, were, mainly, the, result, of, the, difficult, times, and, something, the, ibsen, family, had, in, common, with, most, members, of, the, bourgeoisie, haave, further, argues, that, henrik, ibsen, had, a, happy, and, comfortable, childhood, as, a, member, of, the, upper, class, even, after, the, family, moved, to, venst, p, and, that, they, were, able, to, maintain, their, lifestyle, and, patrician, identity, with, the, help, of, their, extended, family, and, accumulated, cultural, capital, contrary, to, the, incorrect, claims, that, ibsen, had, been, born, in, a, small, or, remote, town, haave, points, out, that, skien, had, been, eastern, norway, s, leading, commercial, city, for, centuries, and, a, centre, of, seafaring, timber, exports, and, early, industrialization, that, had, made, norway, the, developed, and, prosperous, part, of, denmark, norway, rees, characterizes, ibsen, s, family, as, upper, class, rather, than, middle, class, and, part, of, the, closest, thing, norway, had, to, an, aristocracy, albeit, one, that, lost, most, of, its, power, during, his, lifetime, ibsen, scholar, jon, nygaard, stated, that, ibsen, has, an, exceptional, upper, class, background, and, is, a, result, of, norway, being, a, wealthy, country, for, a, very, long, time, haave, points, out, that, virtually, all, of, ibsen, s, ancestors, had, been, wealthy, burghers, and, higher, government, officials, and, members, of, the, local, and, regional, elites, in, the, areas, they, lived, often, of, continental, european, ancestry, he, argues, that, the, ibsen, family, belonged, to, an, elite, that, distanced, itself, strongly, from, the, common, farmer, population, and, considered, itself, part, of, an, educated, european, culture, and, that, it, was, this, patrician, class, that, formed, his, cultural, identity, and, upbringing, haave, points, to, many, examples, of, both, henrik, ibsen, and, other, members, of, his, family, having, a, condescending, attitude, towards, common, norwegian, farmers, viewing, them, as, some, sort, of, primitive, indigenous, population, and, being, very, conscious, of, their, own, identity, as, members, of, the, sophisticated, upper, class, haave, points, out, that, ibsen, s, most, immediate, family, knud, marichen, and, henrik, s, siblings, disintegrated, financially, and, socially, in, the, 1850s, but, that, it, happened, after, henrik, had, left, home, at, a, time, when, he, was, establishing, himself, as, a, successful, man, of, theatre, while, his, extended, family, such, as, his, uncles, henrik, johan, paus, christian, cornelius, paus, and, christopher, blom, paus, were, firmly, established, in, skien, s, elite, as, lawyers, government, officials, and, wealthy, shipowners, haave, argues, that, the, story, of, the, ibsen, family, is, the, story, of, the, slow, collapse, of, a, patrician, merchant, family, amid, the, emergence, of, a, new, democratic, society, in, the, 19th, century, and, that, henrik, ibsen, like, others, of, his, class, had, to, find, new, opportunities, to, maintain, his, social, position, nygaard, summarized, the, revolution, in, the, understanding, of, ibsen, s, childhood, and, background, as, all, the, popular, notions, about, ibsen, being, wrong, many, ibsen, scholars, have, compared, characters, and, themes, in, his, plays, to, his, family, and, upbringing, his, themes, often, deal, with, issues, of, financial, difficulty, as, well, as, moral, conflicts, stemming, from, dark, secrets, hidden, from, society, ibsen, himself, confirmed, that, he, both, modeled, and, named, characters, in, his, plays, after, his, own, family, works, such, as, peer, gynt, the, wild, duck, rosmersholm, hedda, gabler, an, enemy, of, the, people, and, ghosts, include, numerous, references, to, ibsen, s, relatives, family, history, and, childhood, memories, however, despite, ibsen, s, use, of, his, family, as, an, inspiration, for, his, plays, haave, criticizes, the, uncritical, use, of, ibsen, s, dramas, as, biographical, sources, and, the, naive, readings, of, them, as, literal, representations, of, his, family, members, in, particular, his, father, at, fifteen, ibsen, left, school, he, moved, to, the, small, town, of, grimstad, to, become, an, apprentice, pharmacist, at, that, time, he, began, writing, plays, in, 1846, when, ibsen, was, 18, he, had, a, liaison, with, else, sophie, jensdatter, birkedalen, which, produced, a, son, hans, jacob, hendrichsen, birkdalen, whose, upbringing, ibsen, paid, for, until, the, boy, was, fourteen, though, ibsen, never, saw, the, child, ibsen, went, to, christiania, later, spelled, kristiania, and, then, renamed, oslo, intending, to, matriculate, at, the, university, he, soon, rejected, the, idea, his, earlier, attempts, at, entering, university, were, blocked, as, he, did, not, pass, all, his, entrance, exams, preferring, to, commit, himself, to, writing, his, first, play, the, tragedy, catilina, 1850, was, published, under, the, pseudonym, brynjolf, bjarme, when, he, was, only, 22, but, it, was, not, performed, his, first, play, to, be, staged, the, burial, mound, 1850, received, little, attention, still, ibsen, was, determined, to, be, a, playwright, although, the, numerous, plays, he, wrote, in, the, following, years, remained, unsuccessful, ibsen, s, main, inspiration, in, the, early, period, right, up, to, peer, gynt, was, apparently, the, norwegian, author, henrik, wergeland, and, the, norwegian, folk, tales, as, collected, by, peter, christen, asbj, rnsen, and, j, rgen, moe, in, ibsen, s, youth, wergeland, was, the, most, acclaimed, and, by, far, the, most, read, norwegian, poet, and, playwright, ibsen, spent, the, next, several, years, employed, at, det, norske, theater, bergen, where, he, was, involved, in, the, production, of, more, than, 145, plays, as, a, writer, director, and, producer, during, this, period, he, published, five, new, though, largely, unremarkable, plays, despite, ibsen, s, failure, to, achieve, success, as, a, playwright, he, gained, a, great, deal, of, practical, experience, at, the, norwegian, theater, experience, that, was, to, prove, valuable, when, he, continued, writing, ibsen, returned, to, christiania, in, 1858, to, become, the, creative, director, of, the, christiania, theatre, he, married, suzannah, thoresen, on, 18, june, 1858, and, she, gave, birth, to, their, only, child, sigurd, on, 23, december, 1859, the, couple, lived, in, difficult, financial, circumstances, and, ibsen, became, very, disenchanted, with, life, in, norway, in, 1864, he, left, christiania, and, went, to, sorrento, in, italy, in, self, imposed, exile, he, spent, the, next, 27, years, in, italy, and, germany, and, only, visited, norway, a, few, times, during, those, years, his, next, play, brand, 1865, brought, him, the, critical, acclaim, he, sought, along, with, a, measure, of, financial, success, as, did, the, following, play, peer, gynt, 1867, to, which, edvard, grieg, composed, incidental, music, and, songs, although, ibsen, read, excerpts, of, the, danish, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, traces, of, the, latter, s, influence, are, evident, in, brand, it, was, not, until, after, brand, that, ibsen, came, to, take, kierkegaard, seriously, initially, annoyed, with, his, friend, georg, brandes, for, comparing, brand, to, kierkegaard, ibsen, nevertheless, read, either, or, and, fear, and, trembling, ibsen, s, next, play, peer, gynt, was, consciously, informed, by, kierkegaard, with, success, ibsen, became, more, confident, and, began, to, introduce, more, and, more, of, his, own, beliefs, and, judgements, into, the, drama, exploring, what, he, termed, the, drama, of, ideas, his, next, series, of, plays, are, often, considered, his, golden, age, when, he, entered, the, height, of, his, power, and, influence, becoming, the, center, of, dramatic, controversy, across, europe, ibsen, moved, from, italy, to, dresden, germany, in, 1868, where, he, spent, years, writing, the, play, he, regarded, as, his, main, work, emperor, and, galilean, 1873, dramatizing, the, life, and, times, of, the, roman, emperor, julian, the, apostate, although, ibsen, himself, always, looked, back, on, this, play, as, the, cornerstone, of, his, entire, works, very, few, shared, his, opinion, and, his, next, works, would, be, much, more, acclaimed, ibsen, moved, to, munich, in, 1875, and, began, work, on, his, first, contemporary, realist, drama, the, pillars, of, society, first, published, and, performed, in, 1877, a, doll, s, house, followed, in, 1879, this, play, is, a, scathing, criticism, of, the, marital, roles, accepted, by, men, and, women, which, characterized, ibsen, s, society, ibsen, was, already, in, his, fifties, when, a, doll, s, house, was, published, he, himself, saw, his, latter, plays, as, a, series, at, the, end, of, his, career, he, described, them, as, that, series, of, dramas, which, began, with, a, doll, s, house, and, which, is, now, completed, with, when, we, dead, awaken, furthermore, it, was, the, reception, of, a, doll, s, house, which, brought, ibsen, international, acclaim, ghosts, followed, in, 1881, another, scathing, commentary, on, the, morality, of, ibsen, s, society, in, which, a, widow, reveals, to, her, pastor, that, she, had, hidden, the, evils, of, her, marriage, for, its, duration, the, pastor, had, advised, her, to, marry, her, fianc, despite, his, philandering, and, she, did, so, in, the, belief, that, her, love, would, reform, him, but, his, philandering, continued, right, up, until, his, death, and, his, vices, are, passed, on, to, their, son, in, the, form, of, syphilis, the, mention, of, venereal, disease, alone, was, scandalous, but, to, show, how, it, could, poison, a, respectable, family, was, considered, intolerable, in, an, enemy, of, the, people, 1882, ibsen, went, even, further, in, earlier, plays, controversial, elements, were, important, and, even, pivotal, components, of, the, action, but, they, were, on, the, small, scale, of, individual, households, in, an, enemy, controversy, became, the, primary, focus, and, the, antagonist, was, the, entire, community, one, primary, message, of, the, play, is, that, the, individual, who, stands, alone, is, more, often, right, than, the, mass, of, people, who, are, portrayed, as, ignorant, and, sheeplike, contemporary, society, s, belief, was, that, the, community, was, a, noble, institution, that, could, be, trusted, a, notion, ibsen, challenged, in, an, enemy, of, the, people, ibsen, chastised, not, only, the, conservatism, of, society, but, also, the, liberalism, of, the, time, he, illustrated, how, people, on, both, sides, of, the, social, spectrum, could, be, equally, self, serving, an, enemy, of, the, people, was, written, as, a, response, to, the, people, who, had, rejected, his, previous, work, ghosts, the, plot, of, the, play, is, a, veiled, look, at, the, way, people, reacted, to, the, plot, of, ghosts, the, protagonist, is, a, physician, in, a, vacation, spot, whose, primary, draw, is, a, public, bath, the, doctor, discovers, that, the, water, is, contaminated, by, the, local, tannery, he, expects, to, be, acclaimed, for, saving, the, town, from, the, nightmare, of, infecting, visitors, with, disease, but, instead, he, is, declared, an, enemy, of, the, people, by, the, locals, who, band, against, him, and, even, throw, stones, through, his, windows, the, play, ends, with, his, complete, ostracism, it, is, obvious, to, the, reader, that, disaster, is, in, store, for, the, town, as, well, as, for, the, doctor, as, audiences, by, now, expected, ibsen, s, next, play, again, attacked, entrenched, beliefs, and, assumptions, but, this, time, his, attack, was, not, against, society, s, mores, but, against, overeager, reformers, and, their, idealism, always, an, iconoclast, ibsen, saw, himself, as, an, objective, observer, of, society, like, a, lone, franc, tireur, in, the, outposts, playing, a, lone, hand, as, he, put, it, ibsen, perhaps, more, than, any, of, his, contemporaries, relied, upon, immediate, sources, such, as, newspapers, and, second, hand, report, for, his, contact, with, intellectual, thought, he, claimed, to, be, ignorant, of, books, leaving, them, to, his, wife, and, son, but, as, georg, brandes, described, he, seemed, to, stand, in, some, mysterious, correspondence, with, the, fermenting, germinating, ideas, of, the, day, the, wild, duck, 1884, is, by, many, considered, ibsen, s, finest, work, and, it, is, certainly, one, of, the, most, complex, alongside, rosmersholm, when, working, on, the, play, ibsen, received, his, only, visit, from, a, relative, during, his, decades, in, exile, when, 21, year, old, count, christopher, paus, paid, an, extended, visit, to, him, in, rome, j, rgen, haave, notes, that, ibsen, had, not, been, this, close, to, his, own, family, since, he, left, his, hometown, over, 30, years, ago, and, he, was, eager, to, hear, news, from, his, family, and, hometown, shortly, after, the, visit, ibsen, declared, that, he, had, overcome, a, writer, s, block, the, wild, duck, draws, inspiration, from, ibsen, s, family, and, tells, the, story, of, gregers, werle, described, by, ibsen, scholar, jon, nygaard, as, representing, the, spirit, of, the, paus, family, a, young, man, who, returns, to, his, hometown, after, an, extended, exile, and, who, is, reunited, with, his, boyhood, friend, hjalmar, ekdal, over, the, course, of, the, play, the, many, secrets, that, lie, behind, the, ekdals, apparently, happy, home, are, revealed, to, gregers, who, insists, on, pursuing, the, absolute, truth, or, the, summons, of, the, ideal, among, these, truths, gregers, father, impregnated, his, servant, gina, then, married, her, off, to, hjalmar, to, legitimize, the, child, another, man, has, been, disgraced, and, imprisoned, for, a, crime, the, elder, werle, committed, furthermore, while, hjalmar, spends, his, days, working, on, a, wholly, imaginary, invention, his, wife, is, earning, the, household, income, ibsen, displays, masterly, use, of, irony, despite, his, dogmatic, insistence, on, truth, gregers, never, says, what, he, thinks, but, only, insinuates, and, is, never, understood, until, the, play, reaches, its, climax, gregers, hammers, away, at, hjalmar, through, innuendo, and, coded, phrases, until, he, realizes, the, truth, that, gina, s, daughter, hedvig, is, not, his, child, blinded, by, gregers, insistence, on, absolute, truth, hjalmar, disavows, the, child, seeing, the, damage, he, has, wrought, gregers, determines, to, repair, things, and, suggests, to, hedvig, that, she, sacrifice, the, wild, duck, her, wounded, pet, to, prove, her, love, for, hjalmar, hedvig, alone, among, the, characters, recognizes, that, gregers, always, speaks, in, code, and, looking, for, the, deeper, meaning, in, the, first, important, statement, gregers, makes, which, does, not, contain, one, kills, herself, rather, than, the, duck, in, order, to, prove, her, love, for, him, in, the, ultimate, act, of, self, sacrifice, only, too, late, do, hjalmar, and, gregers, realize, that, the, absolute, truth, of, the, ideal, is, sometimes, too, much, for, the, human, heart, to, bear, late, in, his, career, ibsen, turned, to, a, more, introspective, drama, that, had, much, less, to, do, with, denunciations, of, society, s, moral, values, and, more, to, do, with, the, problems, of, individuals, in, such, later, plays, as, hedda, gabler, 1890, and, the, master, builder, 1892, ibsen, explored, psychological, conflicts, that, transcended, a, simple, rejection, of, current, conventions, many, modern, readers, who, might, regard, anti, victorian, didacticism, as, dated, simplistic, or, hackneyed, have, found, these, later, works, to, be, of, absorbing, interest, for, their, hard, edged, objective, consideration, of, interpersonal, confrontation, hedda, gabler, and, a, doll, s, house, are, regularly, cited, as, ibsen, s, most, popular, and, influential, plays, with, the, title, role, of, hedda, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, challenging, and, rewarding, for, an, actress, even, in, the, present, day, ibsen, had, completely, rewritten, the, rules, of, drama, with, a, realism, which, was, to, be, adopted, by, chekhov, and, others, and, which, we, see, in, the, theatre, to, this, day, from, ibsen, forward, challenging, assumptions, and, directly, speaking, about, issues, has, been, considered, one, of, the, factors, that, makes, a, play, art, rather, than, entertainment, his, works, were, brought, to, an, english, speaking, audience, largely, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, william, archer, and, edmund, gosse, these, in, turn, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, young, james, joyce, who, venerates, ibsen, in, his, early, autobiographical, novel, stephen, hero, ibsen, returned, to, norway, in, 1891, but, it, was, in, many, ways, not, the, norway, he, had, left, indeed, he, had, played, a, major, role, in, the, changes, that, had, happened, across, society, modernism, was, on, the, rise, not, only, in, the, theatre, but, across, public, life, ibsen, intentionally, obscured, his, influences, however, asked, later, what, he, had, read, when, he, wrote, catiline, ibsen, replied, that, he, had, read, only, the, danish, norse, saga, inspired, romantic, tragedian, adam, oehlenschl, ger, and, ludvig, holberg, the, scandinavian, moli, re, a, major, influence, on, ibsen, were, danish, writers, such, as, me, r, aron, goldschmidt, and, georg, brandes, as, well, as, his, collaboration, and, friendship, with, the, early, realist, swedish, poet, carl, snoilsky, on, 23, may, 1906, ibsen, died, in, his, home, at, arbins, gade, 1, in, kristiania, now, oslo, after, a, series, of, strokes, in, march, 1900, when, on, 22, may, his, nurse, assured, a, visitor, that, he, was, a, little, better, ibsen, spluttered, his, last, words, on, the, contrary, tvertimod, he, died, the, following, day, at, 2, 30, pm, ibsen, was, buried, in, v, r, frelsers, gravlund, the, graveyard, of, our, savior, in, central, oslo, the,

with, the, house, where, ibsen, had, spent, his, last, eleven, years, completely, restored, with, the, original, interior, colours, and, decor, ivo, de, figueiredo, argues, that, today, ibsen, belongs, to, the, world, but, it, is, impossible, to, understand, path, out, there, without, knowing, the, danish, cultural, sphere, from, which, he, sprang, from, which, he, liberated, himself, and, which, he, ended, up, shaping, ibsen, developed, as, a, person, and, artist, in, a, dialogue, with, danish, theater, and, literature, that, was, anything, but, smooth, on, the, occasion, of, the, 100th, anniversary, of, ibsen, s, death, in, 2006, the, norwegian, government, organised, the, ibsen, year, which, included, celebrations, around, the, world, the, nrk, produced, a, miniseries, on,

performances, conferences, and, publications, an, understanding, of, ibsen, s, works, as, they, are, interpreted, as, texts, and, produced, on, stage, and, in, film, and, other, media, an, annual, newsletter, ibsen, news, and, comment, is, distributed, to, all, members, on, 20, march, 2013, google, celebrated, henrik, ibsen, s, 185th, birthday, with, a, doodle, at, the, time, when, ibsen, was, writing, literature, was, emerging, as, a, formidable, force, in, 19th, century, society, with, the, vast, increase, in, literacy, towards, the, end, of, the, century, the, possibilities, of, literature, being, used, for, subversion, struck, horror, into, the, heart, of, the, establishment, ibsen, s, plays, from, a, doll, s, house, onwards, caused, an, uproar, not, just, in, norway, but, throughout, europe, and, even, across, the, atlantic, in, america, no, other, artist, apart, from, richard, wagner, had, such, an, effect, internationally, inspiring, almost, blasphemous, adoration, and, hysterical, abuse, after, the, publication, of, ghosts, he, wrote, while, the, storm, lasted, i, have, made, many, studies, and, observations, and, i, shall, not, hesitate, to, exploit, them, in, my, future, writings, indeed, his, next, play, an, enemy, of, the, people, was, initially, regarded, by, the, critics, to, be, simply, his, response, to, the, violent, criticism, which, had, greeted, ghosts, ibsen, expected, criticism, as, he, wrote, to, his, publisher, ghosts, will, probably, cause, alarm, in, some, circles, but, it, can, t, be, helped, if, it, did, not, there, would, have, been, no, necessity, for, me, to, have, written, it, ibsen, didn, t, just, read, the, critical, reaction, to, his, plays, he, actively, corresponded, with, critics, publishers, theatre, directors, and, newspaper, editors, on, the, subject, the, interpretation, of, his, work, both, by, critics, and, directors, concerned, him, greatly, he, often, advised, directors, on, which, actor, or, actress, would, be, suitable, for, a, particular, role, an, example, of, this, is, a, letter, he, wrote, to, hans, schroder, in, november, 1884, with, detailed, instructions, for, the, production, of, the, wild, duck, ibsen, s, plays, initially, reached, a, far, wider, audience, as, read, plays, rather, than, in, performance, it, was, 20, years, for, instance, before, the, authorities, would, allow, ghosts, to, be, performed, in, norway, each, new, play, that, ibsen, wrote, from, 1879, onwards, had, an, explosive, effect, on, intellectual, circles, this, was, greatest, for, a, doll, s, house, and, ghosts, and, it, did, lessen, with, the, later, plays, but, the, translation, of, ibsen, s, works, into, german, french, and, english, during, the, decade, following, the, initial, publication, of, each, play, as, well, as, frequent, new, productions, as, and, when, permission, was, granted, meant, that, ibsen, remained, a, topic, of, lively, conversation, throughout, the, latter, decades, of, the, 19th, century, when, a, doll, s, house, was, published, it, had, an, explosive, effect, it, was, the, centre, of, every, conversation, at, every, social, gathering, in, christiania, one, hostess, even, wrote, on, the, invitations, to, her, soir, e, you, are, politely, requested, not, to, mention, mr, ibsen, s, new, play, ibsen, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, 1902, 1903, and, 1904, ibsen, s, ancestry, has, been, a, much, studied, subject, due, to, both, his, perceived, foreignness, and, the, influence, of, his, biography, and, family, on, his, plays, ibsen, often, made, references, to, his, family, in, his, plays, sometimes, by, name, or, by, modelling, characters, after, them, the, oldest, documented, member, of, the, ibsen, family, was, ship, s, captain, rasmus, ibsen, 1632, 1703, from, stege, denmark, his, son, ship, s, captain, peder, ibsen, became, a, burgher, of, bergen, in, norway, in, 1726, henrik, ibsen, had, danish, german, norwegian, and, some, distant, scottish, ancestry, most, of, his, ancestors, belonged, to, the, merchant, class, of, original, danish, and, german, extraction, and, many, of, his, ancestors, were, ship, s, captains, ibsen, s, biographer, henrik, j, ger, famously, wrote, in, 1888, that, ibsen, did, not, have, a, drop, of, norwegian, blood, in, his, veins, stating, that, the, ancestral, ibsen, was, a, dane, this, however, is, not, completely, accurate, notably, through, his, grandmother, hedevig, paus, ibsen, was, descended, from, the, paus, family, often, considered, one, of, the, oldest, families, in, norway, ibsen, s, ancestors, had, mostly, lived, in, norway, for, several, generations, even, though, many, had, foreign, ancestry, the, name, ibsen, is, originally, a, patronymic, meaning, son, of, ib, ib, is, a, danish, variant, of, jacob, the, patronymic, became, frozen, i, e, it, became, a, permanent, family, name, in, the, 17th, century, the, phenomenon, of, patronymics, becoming, frozen, started, in, the, 17th, century, in, bourgeois, families, in, denmark, and, the, practice, was, only, widely, adopted, in, norway, from, around, 1900, from, his, marriage, with, suzannah, thoresen, ibsen, had, one, son, lawyer, government, minister, and, norwegian, prime, minister, sigurd, ibsen, sigurd, ibsen, married, bergljot, bj, rnson, the, daughter, of, bj, rnstjerne,

with, the, male, descended, lines, of, the, wider, ibsen, family, he, belonged, to, will, end, with, the, deaths, of, tancred, jr, s, two, daughters, sigurd, ibsen, s, daughter, irene, ibsen, married, josias, bille, a, member, of, the, danish, ancient, noble, bille, family, their, son, was, danish, actor, joen, bille, ibsen, had, an, illegitimate, child, early, in, his, life, not, entitled, to, the, family, name, or, inheritance, this, line, ended, with, his, biological, grandchildren, in, a, letter, to, george, brandes, shortly, before, the, paris, commune, ibsen, expressed, anarchist, views, that, brandes, later, positively, related, to, the, paris, commune, ibsen, wrote, that, the, state, is, the, curse, of, the, individual, the, state, must, be, abolished, brandes, related, that, ibsen, presented, to, me, as, political, ideals, conditions, and, ideas, whose, nature, did, not, seem, to, me, quite, clear, but, which, were, unquestionably, akin, to, those, that, were, proclaimed, precisely, one, month, later, in, an, extremely, distorted, form, by, the, parisian, commune, and, in, another, letter, shortly, before, the, commune, came, to, an, end, ibsen, expressed, a, disappointment, with, the, commune, insofar, as, it, did, not, go, far, enough, in, its, anarchism, in, its, rejection, of, the, state, and, private, property, ibsen, wrote, is, it, not, impudent, of, the, commune, in, paris, to, go, and, destroy, my, admirable, state, theory, or, rather, no, state, theory, the, idea, is, now, ruined, for, a, long, time, to, come, and, i, cannot, even, set, it, forth, in, verse, with, any, propriety, however, ibsen, nevertheless, expressed, an, optimism, asserting, that, his, no, state, theory, bears, within, itself, a, healthy, core, and, that, some, day, it, will, be, practised, without, any, caricature, plays, entirely, or, partly, in, verse, are, marked, v, major, translation, projects, include, ibsen, was, decorated, knight, in, 1873, commander,
