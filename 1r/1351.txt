the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, she, and, pedro, ii, were, married, by, proxy, in, naples, on, 30, may, 1843, upon, seeing, her, in, person, the, emperor, was, noticeably, disappointed, teresa, cristina, was, short, a, bit, overweight, and, not, considered, conventionally, pretty, he, did, little, to, hide, his, disillusionment, one, observer, stated, that, he, turned, his, back, to, teresa, cristina, another, depicted, him, as, being, so, shocked, that, he, needed, to, sit, that, evening, pedro, ii, wept, and, complained, to, mariana, de, verna, they, have, deceived, me, dadama, it, took, several, hours, to, convince, him, that, duty, demanded, that, he, proceed, the, nuptial, mass, with, the, ratification, of, the, vows, previously, taken, by, proxy, and, the, conferral, of, the, nuptial, blessing, occurred, on, the, following, day, 4, september, in, late, 1845, and, early, 1846, the, emperor, made, a, tour, of, brazil, s, southern, provinces, traveling, through, s, o,

matured, physically, and, mentally, he, grew, into, a, man, who, at, 1, 90, meters, 6, ft, 3, in, tall, with, blue, eyes, and, blond, hair, was, seen, as, handsome, with, growth, his, weaknesses, faded, and, his, strengths, of, character, came, to, the, fore, he, became, self, assured, and, learned, to, be, not, only, impartial, and, diligent, but, also, courteous, patient, and, personable,

importantly, this, period, saw, the, end, of, the, courtier, faction, pedro, ii, began, to, fully, exercise, authority, and, successfully, engineered, the, end, of, the, courtiers, influence, by, removing, them, from, his, inner, circle, while, avoiding, any, public, disruption, pedro, ii, was, faced, by, three, crises, between, 1848, and, 1852, the, first, test, came, in, confronting, the,

by, march, 1849, the, eus, bio, de, queir, s, law, was, promulgated, on, 4, september, 1850, which, gave, the, brazilian, government, broad, authority, to, combat, the, illegal, slave, trade, with, this, new, tool, brazil, moved, to, eliminate, importation, of, slaves, by, 1852, this, first, crisis, was, over, and, britain, accepted, that, the, trade, had, been, suppressed, the, third, crisis, entailed, a, conflict, with, the, argentine, confederation, regarding, ascendancy, over, territories, adjacent, to, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, free, navigation, of, that, waterway, since, the, 1830s, argentine, dictator, juan, manuel, de, rosas, had, supported, rebellions, within, uruguay, and, brazil, it, was, only, in, 1850, that, brazil, was, able, to, address, the, threat, posed, by, rosas, an, alliance, was, forged, between, brazil, uruguay, and, disaffected, argentines, leading, to, the, platine, war, and, the, subsequent, overthrow, of, the, argentine, ruler, in, february, 1852, barman, said, that, a, considerable, portion, of, the, credit, must, be, assigned, to, the, emperor, whose, cool, head, tenacity, of, purpose, and, sense, of, what, was, feasible, proved, indispensable, the, empire, s, successful, navigation, of, these, crises, considerably, enhanced, the, nation, s, stability, and, prestige, and, brazil, emerged, as, a, hemispheric, power, internationally, europeans, began, to, regard, the, country, as, embodying, familiar, liberal, ideals, such, as, freedom, of, the, press, and, constitutional, respect, for, civil, liberties, its, representative, parliamentary, monarchy, also, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, mix, of, dictatorships, and, instability, endemic, in, the, other, nations, of, south, america, during, this, period, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1850s, brazil, enjoyed, internal, stability, and, economic, prosperity, under, the, prime, ministry, of, hon, rio, hermeto, carneiro, le, o, then, viscount, and, later, marquis, of, paran, the, emperor, advanced, his, own, ambitious, program, the, concilia, o, conciliation, and, melhoramentos, material, developments, pedro, ii, s, reforms, aimed, to, promote, less, political, partisanship, and, forward, infrastructure, and, economic, development, the, nation, was, being, interconnected, through, railroad, electrical, telegraph, and, steamship, lines, uniting, it, into, a, single, entity, the, general, opinion, both, at, home, and, abroad, was, that, these, accomplishments, had, been, possible, due, to, brazil, s, governance, as, a, monarchy, and, the, character, of, pedro, ii, pedro, ii, was, neither, a, british, style, figurehead, nor, an, autocrat, in, the, manner, of, russian, czars, the, emperor, exercised, power, through, cooperation, with, elected, politicians, economic, interests, and, popular, support, the, active, presence, of, pedro, ii, on, the, political, scene, was, an, important, part, of, the, government, s, structure, which, also, included, the, cabinet, the, chamber, of, deputies, and, the, senate, the, latter, two, formed, the, general, assembly, he, used, his, participation, in, directing, the, course, of, government, as, a, means, of, influence, his, direction, became, indispensable, although, it, never, devolved, into, one, man, rule, in, his, handling, of, the, political, parties, he, needed, to, maintain, a, reputation, for, impartiality, work, in, accord, with, the, popular, mood, and, avoid, any, flagrant, imposition, of, his, will, on, the, political, scene, the, emperor, s, more, notable, political, successes, were, achieved, primarily, because, of, the, non, confrontational, and, cooperative, manner, with, which, he, approached, both, issues, and, the, partisan, figures, with, whom, he, had, to, deal, he, was, remarkably, tolerant, seldom, taking, offense, at, criticism, opposition, or, even, incompetence, he, did, not, have, the, constitutional, authority, to, force, acceptance, of, his, initiatives, without, support, and, his, collaborative, approach, towards, governing, kept, the, nation, progressing, and, enabled, the, political, system, to, successfully, function, the, emperor, respected, the, prerogatives, of, the, legislature, even, when, they, resisted, delayed, or, thwarted, his, goals, and, appointments, most, politicians, appreciated, and, supported, his, role, many, had, lived, through, the, regency, period, when, the, lack, of, an, emperor, who, could, stand, above, petty, and, special, interests, led, to, years, of, strife, between, political, factions, their, experiences, in, public, life, had, created, a, conviction, that, pedro, ii, was, indispensable, to, brazil, s, continued, peace, and, prosperity, the, marriage, between, pedro, ii, and, teresa, cristina, started, off, badly, with, maturity, patience, and, their, first, child, afonso, their, relationship, improved, later, teresa, cristina, gave, birth, to, more, children, isabel, in, 1846, leopoldina, in, 1847, and, lastly, pedro, afonso, in, 1848, both, boys, died, when, very, young, which, devastated, the, emperor, and, completely, changed, his, view, of, the, empire, s, future, despite, his, affection, for, his, daughters, he, did, not, believe, that, princess, isabel, although, his, heir, would, have, any, chance, of, prospering, on, the, throne, he, felt, his, successor, needed, to, be, male, for, the, monarchy, to, be, viable, he, increasingly, saw, the, imperial, system, as, being, tied, so, inextricably, to, himself, that, it, would, not, survive, him, isabel, and, her, sister, received, a, remarkable, education, although, they, were, given, no, preparation, for, governing, the, nation, pedro, ii, excluded, isabel, from, participation, in, government, business, and, decisions, sometime, around, 1850, pedro, ii, began, having, discreet, affairs, with, other, women, the, most, famous, and, enduring, of, these, relationships, involved, lu, sa, margarida, portugal, de, barros, countess, of, barral, with, whom, he, formed, a, romantic, and, intimate, though, not, adulterous, friendship, after, she, was, appointed, governess, to, the, emperor, s, daughters, in, november, 1856, throughout, his, life, the, emperor, held, onto, a, hope, of, finding, a, soulmate, something, he, felt, cheated, of, due, to, the, necessity, of, a, marriage, of, state, to, a, woman, for, whom, he, never, felt, passion, this, is, but, one, instance, illustrating, his, dual, identity, one, who, assiduously, carried, out, his, duty, as, emperor, and, another, who, considered, the, imperial, office, an, unrewarding, burden, and, who, was, happier, in, the, worlds, of, literature, and, science, pedro, ii, was, hard, working, and, his, routine, was, demanding, he, usually, woke, up, at, 7, 00, and, did, not, sleep, before, 2, 00, in, the, morning, his, entire, day, was, devoted, to, the, affairs, of, state, and, the, meager, free, time,

politicians, and, government, officials, to, the, strict, standards, which, he, exemplified, the, emperor, adopted, a, strict, policy, for, the, selection, of, civil, servants, based, on, morality, and, merit, to, set, the, standard, he, lived, simply, once, having, said, i, also, understand, that, useless, expenditure, is, the, same, as, stealing, from, the, nation, balls, and, assemblies, of,

second, was, the, arrest, of, a, group, of, drunken, british, sailors, who, were, causing, a, disturbance, in, the, streets, of, rio, the, brazilian, government, refused, to, yield, and, christie, issued, orders, for, british, warships, to, capture, brazilian, merchant, vessels, as, indemnity, brazil, prepared, for, what, was, seen, as, an, imminent, conflict, pedro, ii, was, the, main, reason, for, brazil, s, resistance, he, rejected, any, suggestion, of, yielding, this, response, came, as, a, surprise, to, christie, who, changed, his, tenor, and, proposed, a, peaceful, settlement, through, international, arbitration, the, brazilian, government, presented, its, demands, and, upon, seeing, the, british, government, s, position, weaken, severed, diplomatic, ties, with, britain, in, june, 1863, as, war, with, the, british, empire, threatened, brazil, had, to, turn, its, attention, to, its, southern, frontiers, another, civil, war, had, begun, in, uruguay, as, its, political, parties, turned, against, each, other, the, internal, conflict, led, to, the, murder, of, brazilians, and, looting, of, their, property, in, uruguay, brazil, s, government, decided, to, intervene, fearful, of, giving, any, impression, of, weakness, in, the, face, of, conflict, with, the, british, a, brazilian, army, invaded, uruguay, in, december, 1864, beginning, the, brief, uruguayan, war, which, ended, in, february, 1865, meanwhile, the, dictator, of, paraguay, francisco, solano, l, pez, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, establish, his, country, as, a, regional, power, the, paraguayan, army, invaded, the, brazilian, province, of, mato, grosso, the, area, known, after, 1977, as, the, state, of, mato, grosso, do, sul, triggering, the, paraguayan, war, four, months, later, paraguayan, troops, invaded, argentine, territory, as, a, prelude, to, an, attack, on, rio, grande, do, sul, aware, of, the, anarchy, in, rio, grande, do, sul, and, the, incapacity, and, incompetence, of, its, military, chiefs, to, resist, the, paraguayan, army, pedro, ii, decided, to, go, to, the, front, in, person, upon, receiving, objections, from, the, cabinet, the, general, assembly, and, the, council, of, state, pedro, ii, pronounced, if, they, can, prevent, me, from, going, as, an, emperor, they, cannot, prevent, me, from, abdicating, and, going, as, a, fatherland, volunteer, an, allusion, to, those, brazilians, who, volunteered, to, go, to, war, and, became, known, throughout, the, nation, as, the, fatherland, volunteers, the, monarch, himself, was, popularly, called, the, number, one, volunteer, given, permission, to, leave, pedro, ii, disembarked, in, rio, grande, do, sul, in, july, and, proceeded, from, there, by, land, he, travelled, overland, by, horse, and, wagon, sleeping, at, night, in, a, campaign, tent, in, september, pedro, ii, arrived, in, uruguaiana, a, brazilian, town, occupied, by, a, besieged, paraguayan, army, the, emperor, rode, within, rifle, shot, of, uruguaiana, but, the, paraguayans, did, not, attack, him, to, avoid, further, bloodshed, he, offered, terms, of, surrender, to, the, paraguayan, commander, who, accepted, pedro, ii, s, coordination, of, the, military, operations, and, his, personal, example, played, a, decisive, role, in, successfully, repulsing, the, paraguayan, invasion, of, brazilian, territory, before, returning, to, rio, de, janeiro, he, received, the, british, diplomatic, envoy, edward, thornton, who, apologized, on, behalf, of, queen, victoria, and, the, british, government, for, the, crisis, between, the, empires, the, emperor, regarded, this, diplomatic, victory, over, the, most, powerful, nation, of, the, world, as, sufficient, and, renewed, friendly, relations, against, all, expectations, the, war, continued, for, five, years, during, this, period, pedro, ii, s, time, and, energy, were, devoted, to, the, war, effort, he, tirelessly, worked, to, raise, and, equip, troops, to, reinforce, the, front, lines, and, to, push, forward, the, fitting, of, new, warships, for, the, navy, the, rape, of, women, widespread, violence, against, civilians, ransacking, and, destruction, of, properties, that, had, occurred, during, paraguay, s, invasion, of, brazilian, territory, had, made, a, deep, impression, on, him, he, warned, the, countess, of, barral, in, november, 1866, that, the, war, should, be, concluded, as, honor, demands, cost, what, it, cost, difficulties, setbacks, and, war, weariness, had, no, effect, on, his, quiet, resolve, said, barman, mounting, casualties, did, not, distract, him, from, advancing, what, he, saw, as, brazil, s, righteous, cause, and, he, stood, prepared, to, personally, sacrifice, his, own, throne, to, gain, an, honorable, outcome, writing, in, his, journal, a, few, years, previously, pedro, ii, remarked, what, sort, of, fear, could, i, have, that, they, take, the, government, from, me, many, better, kings, than, i, have, lost, it, and, to, me, it, is, no, more, than, the, weight, of, a, cross, which, it, is, my, duty, to, carry, at, the, same, time, pedro, ii, worked, to, prevent, quarrels, between, the, national, political, parties, from, impairing, the, military, response, the, emperor, prevailed, over, a, serious, political, crisis, in, july, 1868, resulting, from, a, quarrel, between, the, cabinet, and, lu, s, alves, de, lima, e, silva, then, marques, and, later, duke, of, caxias, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, brazilian, forces, in, paraguay, caxias, was, also, a, politician, and, was, a, member, of, the, opposing, party, to, the, ministry, the, emperor, sided, with, him, leading, to, the, cabinet, s, resignation, as, pedro, ii, maneuvered, to, bring, about, a, victorious, outcome, in, the, conflict, with, paraguay, he, threw, his, support, behind, the, political, parties, and, factions, that, seemed, to, be, most, useful, in, the, effort, the, reputation, of, the, monarchy, was, harmed, and, its, trusted, position, as, an, impartial, mediator, was, severely, impacted, in, the, long, term, he, was, unconcerned, for, his, personal, position, and, regardless, of, the, impact, upon, the, imperial, system, he, determined, to, put, the, national, interest, ahead, of, any, potential, harm, caused, by, such, expediencies, his, refusal, to, accept, anything, short, of, total, victory, was, pivotal, in, the, outcome, his, tenacity, was, well, paid, with, the, news, that, l, pez, had, died, in, battle, on, 1, march, 1870, bringing, the, war, to, a, close, pedro, ii, turned, down, the, general, assembly, s, suggestion, to, erect, an, equestrian, statue, of, him, to, commemorate, the, victory, and, chose, instead, to, use, the, money, to, build, elementary, schools, in, the, 1870s, progress, was, made, in, both, social, and, political, spheres, as, segments, of, society, benefited, from, the, reforms, and, shared, in, the, increasing, prosperity, brazil, s, international, reputation, for, political, stability, and, investment, potential, greatly, improved, the, empire, was, seen, as, a, modern, and, progressive, nation, unequaled, with, the, exception, of, the, united, states, in, the, americas, the, economy, began, growing, rapidly, and, immigration, flourished, railroad, shipping, and, other, modernization, projects, were, adopted, with, slavery, destined, for, extinction, and, other, reforms, projected, the, prospects, for, moral, and, material, advances, seemed, vast, in, 1870, few, brazilians, opposed, slavery, and, even, fewer, openly, condemned, it, pedro, ii, who, did, not, own, slaves, was, one, of, the, few, who, did, oppose, slavery, its, abolition, was, a, delicate, subject, slaves, were, used, by, all, classes, from, the, richest, to, the, poorest, pedro, ii, wanted, to, end, the, practice, gradually, to, soften, the, impact, to, the, national, economy, with, no, constitutional, authority, to, directly, intervene, to, abolish, slavery, the, emperor, would, need, to, use, all, his, skills, to, convince, influence, and, gather, support, among, politicians, to, achieve, his, goal, his, first, open, move, occurred, back, in, 1850, when, he, threatened, to, abdicate, unless, the, general, assembly, declared, the, atlantic, slave, trade, illegal, having, dealt, with, the, overseas, supply, of, new, slaves, pedro, ii, turned, his, attention, in, the, early, 1860s, to, removing, the, remaining, source, enslavement, of, children, born, to, slaves, legislation, was, drafted, at, his, initiative, but, the, conflict, with, paraguay, delayed, discussion, of, the, proposal, in, the, general, assembly, pedro, ii, openly, asked, for, the, gradual, eradication, of, slavery, in, the, speech, from, the, throne, of, 1867, he, was, heavily, criticized, and, his, move, was, condemned, as, national, suicide, critics, argued, that, abolition, was, his, personal, desire, and, not, that, of, the, nation, he, consciously, ignored, the, growing, political, damage, to, his, image, and, to, the, monarchy, in, consequence, of, his, support, for, abolition, eventually, a, bill, pushed, through, by, prime, minister, jos, paranhos, was, enacted, as, the, law, of, free, birth, on, 28, september, 1871, under, which, all, children, born, to, slave, women, after, that, date, were, considered, free, born, on, 25, may, 1871, pedro, ii, and, his, wife, traveled, to, europe, he, had, long, desired, to, vacation, abroad, when, news, arrived, that, his, younger, daughter, the, 23, year, old, leopoldina, had, died, in, vienna, of, typhoid, fever, on, 7, february, he, finally, had, a, pressing, reason, to, venture, outside, the, empire, upon, arriving, in, lisbon, portugal, he, immediately, went, to, the, janelas, verdes, palace, where, he, met, with, his, stepmother, am, lie, of, leuchtenberg, the, two, had, not, seen, each, other, in, forty, years, and, the, meeting, was, emotional, pedro, ii, remarked, in, his, journal, i, cried, from, happiness, and, also, from, sorrow, seeing, my, mother, so, affectionate, toward, me, but, so, aged, and, so, sick, the, emperor, proceeded, to, visit, spain, great, britain, belgium, germany, austria, italy, egypt, greece, switzerland, and, france, in, coburg, he, visited, his, daughter, s, tomb, he, found, this, to, be, a, time, of, release, and, freedom, he, traveled, under, the, assumed, name, dom, pedro, de, alc, ntara, insisting, upon, being, treated, informally, and, staying, only, in, hotels, he, spent, his, days, sightseeing, and, conversing, with, scientists, and, other, intellectuals, with, whom, he, shared, interests, the, european, sojourn, proved, to, be, a, success, and, his, demeanor, and, curiosity, won, respectful, notices, in, the, nations, which, he, visited, the, prestige, of, both, brazil, and, pedro, ii, were, further, enhanced, during, the, tour, when, news, came, from, brazil, that, the, law, of, free, birth, abolishing, the, last, source, of, enslavement, had, been, ratified, the, imperial, party, returned, to, brazil, in, triumph, on, 31, march, 1872, soon, after, returning, to, brazil, pedro, ii, was, faced, with, an, unexpected, crisis, the, brazilian, clergy, had, long, been, understaffed, undisciplined, and, poorly, educated, leading, to, a, great, loss, of, respect, for, the, catholic, church, the, imperial, government, had, embarked, upon, a, program, of, reform, to, address, these, deficiencies, as, catholicism, was, the, state, religion, the, government, exercised, a, great, deal, of, control, over, church, affairs, paying, clerical, salaries, appointing, parish, priests, nominating, bishops, ratifying, papal, bulls, and, overseeing, seminaries, in, pursuing, reform, the, government, selected, bishops, who, satisfied, its, criteria, for, education, support, for, reform, and, moral, fitness, however, as, more, capable, men, began, to, fill, the, clerical, ranks, resentment, of, government, control, over, the, church, increased, the, bishops, of, olinda, and, bel, m, in, the, provinces, of, pernambuco, and, par, respectively, were, two, of, the, new, generation, of, educated, and, zealous, brazilian, clerics, they, had, been, influenced, by, the, ultramontanism, which, spread, among, catholics, in, this, period, in, 1872, they, ordered, freemasons, expelled, from, lay, brotherhoods, while, european, freemasonry, often, tended, towards, atheism, and, anti, clericalism, things, were, much, different, in, brazil, where, membership, in, masonic, orders, was, common, although, pedro, ii, himself, was, not, a, freemason, the, government, headed, by, the, viscount, of, rio, branco, tried, on, two, separate, occasions, to, persuade, the, bishops, to, repeal, but, they, refused, this, led, to, their, trial, and, conviction, by, the, superior, court, of, justice, in, 1874, they, were, sentenced, four, years, at, hard, labor, although, the, emperor, commuted, this, to, imprisonment, only, pedro, ii, played, a, decisive, role, by, unequivocally, backing, the, government, s, actions, he, was, a, conscientious, adherent, of, catholicism, which, he, viewed, as, advancing, important, civilizing, and, civic, values, while, he, avoided, anything, that, could, be, considered, unorthodox, he, felt, free, to, think, and, behave, independently, the, emperor, accepted, new, ideas, such, as, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, of, which, he, remarked, that, the, laws, that, he, has, discovered, glorify, the, creator, he, was, moderate, in, his, religious, beliefs, but, could, not, accept, disrespect, to, civil, law, and, government, authority, as, he, told, his, son, in, law, has, to, ensure, that, the, constitution, is, obeyed, in, these, proceedings, there, is, no, desire, to, protect, masonry, but, rather, the, goal, of, upholding, the, rights, of, the, civilian, power, the, crisis, was, resolved, in, september, 1875, after, the, emperor, grudgingly, agreed, to, grant, full, amnesty, to, the, bishops, and, the, holy, see, annulled, the, interdicts, once, again, the, emperor, traveled, abroad, this, time, going, to, the, united, states, he, was, accompanied, by, his, faithful, servant, rafael, who, had, raised, him, from, childhood, pedro, ii, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 15, april, 1876, and, set, out, from, there, to, travel, throughout, the, country, going, as, far, as, san, francisco, in, the, west, new, orleans, in, the, south, washington, d, c, and, north, to, toronto, canada, the, trip, was, an, unalloyed, triumph, pedro, ii, making, a, deep, impression, on, the, american, people, with, his, simplicity, and, kindness, he, then, crossed, the, atlantic, where, he, visited, denmark, sweden, finland, russia, the, ottoman, empire, greece, the, holy, land, egypt, italy, austria, germany, france, britain, ireland, the, netherlands, switzerland, and, portugal, he, returned, to, brazil, on, 22, september, 1877, pedro, ii, s, trips, abroad, made, a, deep, psychological, impact, while, traveling, he, was, largely, freed, of, the, restrictions, imposed, by, his, office, under, the, pseudonym, pedro, de, alc, ntara, he, enjoyed, moving, about, as, an, ordinary, person, even, taking, a, train, journey, solely, with, his, wife, only, while, touring, abroad, could, the, emperor, shake, off, the, formal, existence, and, demands, of, the, life, he, knew, in, brazil, it, became, more, difficult, to, reacclimate, to, his, routine, as, head, of, state, upon, returning, upon, his, sons, early, deaths, the, emperor, s, faith, in, the, monarchy, s, future, had, evaporated, his, trips, abroad, now, made, him, resentful, of, the, emperorship, assigned, to, him, at, the, age, of, five, if, he, previously, had, no, interest, in, securing, the, throne, for, the, next, generation, he, now, had, no, desire, to, keep, it, going, during, his, own, lifetime, during, the, 1880s, brazil, continued, to, prosper, and, social, diversity, increased, markedly, including, the, first, organized, push, for, women, s, rights, on, the, other, hand, letters, written, by, pedro, ii, reveal, a, man, grown, world, weary, with, age, and, having, an, increasingly, alienated, and, pessimistic, outlook, he, remained, respectful, of, his, duty, and, was, meticulous, in, performing, the, tasks, demanded, of, the, imperial, office, albeit, often, without, enthusiasm, because, of, his, increasing, indifference, towards, the, fate, of, the, regime, and, his, lack, of, action, in, support, of, the, imperial, system, once, it, was, challenged, historians, have, attributed, the, prime, perhaps, sole, responsibility, for, the, dissolution, of, the, monarchy, to, the, emperor, himself, after, their, experience, of, the, perils, and, obstacles, of, government, the, political, figures, who, had, arisen, during, the, 1830s, saw, the, emperor, as, providing, a, fundamental, source, of, authority, essential, for, governing, and, for, national, survival, these, elder, statesmen, began, to, die, off, or, retire, from, government, until, by, the, 1880s, they, had, almost, entirely, been, replaced, by, a, newer, generation, of, politicians, who, had, no, experience, of, the, early, years, of, pedro, ii, s, reign, they, had, only, known, a, stable, administration, and, prosperity, and, saw, no, reason, to, uphold, and, defend, the, imperial, office, as, a, unifying, force, beneficial, to, the, nation, to, them, pedro, ii, was, merely, an, old, and, increasingly, sick, man, who, had, steadily, eroded, his, position, by, taking, an, active, role, in, politics, for, decades, before, he, had, been, above, criticism, but, now, his, every, action, and, inaction, prompted, meticulous, scrutiny, and, open, criticism, many, young, politicians, had, become, apathetic, toward, the, monarchic, regime, and, when, the, time, came, they, would, do, nothing, to, defend, it, pedro, ii, s, achievements, went, unremembered, and, unconsidered, by, the, ruling, elites, by, his, very, success, the, emperor, had, made, his, position, seem, unnecessary, the, lack, of, an, heir, who, could, feasibly, provide, a, new, direction, for, the, nation, also, diminished, the, long, term, prospects, of, the, brazilian, monarchy, the, emperor, loved, his, daughter, isabel, but, he, considered, the, idea, of, a, female, successor, as, antithetical, to, the, role, required, of, brazil, s, ruler, he, viewed, the, death, of, his, two, sons, as, being, a, sign, that, the, empire, was, destined, to, be, supplanted, resistance, to, accepting, a, female, ruler, was, also, shared, by, the, political, establishment, even, though, the, constitution, allowed, female, succession, to, the, throne, brazil, was, still, very, traditional, and, only, a, male, successor, was, thought, capable, as, head, of, state, by, june, 1887, the, emperor, s, health, had, considerably, worsened, and, his, personal, doctors, suggested, going, to, europe, for, medical, treatment, while, in, milan, he, passed, two, weeks, between, life, and, death, even, being, anointed, while, on, a, bed, recovering, on, 22, may, 1888, he, received, news, that, slavery, had, been, abolished, in, brazil, with, a, weak, voice, and, tears, in, his, eyes, he, said, great, people, great, people, pedro, ii, returned, to, brazil, and, disembarked, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, august, 1888, the, whole, country, welcomed, him, with, an, enthusiasm, never, seen, before, from, the, capital, from, the, provinces, from, everywhere, arrived, proofs, of, affection, and, veneration, with, the, devotion, expressed, by, brazilians, upon, the, return, of, the, emperor, and, the, empress, from, europe, the, monarchy, seemed, to, enjoy, unshakable, support, and, to, be, at, the, height, of, its, popularity, the, nation, enjoyed, great, international, prestige, during, the, final, years, of, the, empire, and, it, had, become, an, emerging, power, within, the, international, arena, predictions, of, economic, and, labor, disruption, caused, by, the, abolition, of, slavery, failed, to, materialize, and, the, 1888, coffee, harvest, was, successful, the, end, of, slavery, had, resulted, in, an, explicit, shift, of, support, to, republicanism, by, rich, and, powerful, coffee, farmers, who, held, great, political, economic, and, social, power, in, the, country, republicanism, was, an, elitist, creed, which, never, flourished, in, brazil, with, little, support, in, the, provinces, the, combination, of, republican, ideas, and, the, dissemination, of, positivism, among, the, army, s, lower, and, medium, officer, ranks, led, to, indiscipline, among, the, corps, and, became, a, serious, threat, to, the, monarchy, they, dreamed, of, a, dictatorial, republic, which, they, believed, would, be, superior, to, the, monarchy, although, there, was, no, desire, in, brazil, among, the, majority, of, the, population, to, change, the, form, of, government, the, civilian, republicans, began, pressuring, army, officers, to, overthrow, the, monarchy, they, launched, a, coup, d, tat, arrested, prime, minister, afonso, celso, viscount, of, ouro, preto, and, instituted, the, republic, on, 15, november, 1889, the, few, people, who, witnessed, what, occurred, did, not, realize, that, it, was, a, rebellion, historian, l, dia, besouchet, noted, that, arely, has, a, revolution, been, so, minor, during, the, ordeal, pedro, ii, showed, no, emotion, as, if, unconcerned, about, the, outcome, he, dismissed, all, suggestions, for, quelling, the, rebellion, that, politicians, and, military, leaders, put, forward, when, he, heard, the, news, of, his, deposition, he, simply, commented, if, it, is, so, it, will, be, my, retirement, i, have, worked, too, hard, and, i, am, tired, i, will, go, rest, then, he, and, his, family, were, sent, into, exile, in, europe, on, 17, november, teresa, cristina, died, three, weeks, after, their, arrival, in, europe, and, isabel, and, her, family, moved, to, another, place, while, pedro, settled, first, in, cannes, and, later, in, paris, pedro, s, last, couple, of, years, were, lonely, and, melancholic, as, he, lived, in, modest, hotels, without, money, and, writing, in, his, journal, of, dreams, in, which, he, was, allowed, to, return, to, brazil, he, never, supported, a, restoration, of, the, monarchy, once, stating, that, he, had, no, desire, to, return, to, the, position, which, i, occupied, especially, not, by, means, of, conspiracy, of, any, sort, one, day, he, caught, an, infection, that, progressed, quickly, into, pneumonia, pedro, rapidly, declined, and, died, at, 00, 35, on, 5, december, 1891, surrounded, by, his, family, his, last, words, were, may, god, grant, me, these, last, wishes, peace, and, prosperity, for, brazil, while, the, body, was, being, prepared, a, sealed, package, in, the, room, was, found, and, next, to, it, a, message, written, by, the, emperor, himself, it, is, soil, from, my, country, i, wish, it, to, be, placed, in, my, coffin, in, case, i, die, away, from, my, fatherland, isabel, wished, to, hold, a, discreet, and, private, burial, ceremony, but, she, eventually, agreed, to, the, french, government, s, request, for, a, state, funeral, on, 9, december, thousands, of, mourners, attended, the, ceremony, at, la, madeleine, aside, from, pedro, s, family, these, included, francesco, ii, former, king, of, the, two, sicilies, isabel, ii, former, queen, of, spain, philippe, comte, de, paris, and, other, members, of, european, royalty, also, present, were, general, joseph, brug, re, representing, president, sadi, carnot, the, presidents, of, the, senate, and, the, chamber, of, deputies, as, well, as, their, members, diplomats, and, other, representatives, of, the, french, government, nearly, all, members, of, the, institut, de, france, were, in, attendance, other, governments, from, the, americas, and, europe, sent, representatives, as, did, the, ottoman, empire, persia, china, and, japan, following, the, services, the, coffin, was, taken, in, procession, to, the, railway, station, to, begin, its, trip, to, portugal, around, 300, 000, people, lined, the, route, under, incessant, rain, and, cold, the, journey, continued, on, to, the, church, of, s, o, vicente, de, fora, near, lisbon, where, the, body, of, pedro, was, interred, in, the, royal, pantheon, of, the, house, of, braganza, on, 12, december, the, brazilian, republican, government, fearful, of, a, backlash, resulting, from, the, death, of, the, emperor, banned, any, official, reaction, nevertheless, brazilians, were, not, indifferent, to, pedro, s, death, and, repercussions, in, brazil, were, also, immense, despite, the, government, s, effort, to, suppress, there, were, demonstrations, of, sorrow, throughout, the, country, shuttered, business, activity, flags, displayed, at, half, staff, black, armbands, on, clothes, death, knells, religious, ceremonies, masses, were, held, in, memory, of, pedro, throughout, brazil, and, he, and, the, monarchy, were, praised, in, the, eulogies, that, followed, after, his, fall, brazilians, remained, attached, to, the, former, emperor, who, was, still, a, popular, and, highly, praised, figure, this, view, was, even, stronger, among, those, of, african, descent, who, equated, the, monarchy, with, freedom, because, of, his, and, his, daughter, isabel, s, part, in, the, abolition, of, slavery, the, continued, support, for, the, deposed, monarch, is, largely, credited, to, a, generally, held, and, unextinguished, belief, that, he, was, a, truly, wise, benevolent, austere, and, honest, ruler, said,
