joseph, priestley, frs, p, r, i, s, t, l, i, 24, march, 1733, 6, february, 1804, was, an, english, chemist, unitarian, natural, philosopher, separatist, theologian, grammarian, multi, subject, educator, and, classical, liberal, political, theorist, he, published, over, 150, works, and, conducted, experiments, in, several, areas, of, science, priestley, is, credited, with, his, independent, discovery, of, oxygen, by, the, thermal, decomposition, of, mercuric, oxide, having, isolated, it, in, 1774, during, his, lifetime, priestley, s, considerable, scientific, reputation, rested, on, his, invention, of, carbonated, water, his, writings, on, electricity, and, his, discovery, of, several, airs, gases, the, most, famous, being, what, priestley, dubbed, dephlogisticated, air, oxygen, priestley, s, determination, to, defend, phlogiston, theory, and, to, reject, what, would, become, the, chemical, revolution, eventually, left, him, isolated, within, the, scientific, community, priestley, s, science, was, integral, to, his, theology, and, he, consistently, tried, to, fuse, enlightenment, rationalism, with, christian, theism, in, his, metaphysical, texts, priestley, attempted, to, combine, theism, materialism, and, determinism, a, project, that, has, been, called, audacious, and, original, he, believed, that, a, proper, understanding, of, the, natural, world, would, promote, human, progress, and, eventually, bring, about, the, christian, millennium, priestley, who, strongly, believed, in, the, free, and, open, exchange, of, ideas, advocated, toleration, and, equal, rights, for, religious, dissenters, which, also, led, him, to, help, found, unitarianism, in, england, the, controversial, nature, of, priestley, s, publications, combined, with, his, outspoken, support, of, the, american, revolution, and, later, the, french, revolution, aroused, public, and, governmental, contempt, eventually, forcing, him, to, flee, in, 1791, first, to, london, and, then, to, the, united, states, after, a, mob, burned, down, his, birmingham, home, and, church, he, spent, his, last, ten, years, in, northumberland, county, pennsylvania, a, scholar, and, teacher, throughout, his, life, priestley, made, significant, contributions, to, pedagogy, including, the, publication, of, a, seminal, work, on, english, grammar, and, books, on, history, he, prepared, some, of, the, most, influential, early, timelines, the, educational, writings, were, among, priestley, s, most, popular, works, arguably, his, metaphysical, works, however, had, the, most, lasting, influence, as, now, considered, primary, sources, for, utilitarianism, by, philosophers, such, as, jeremy, bentham, john, stuart, mill, and, herbert, spencer, priestley, was, born, in, birstall, near, batley, in, the, west, riding, of, yorkshire, to, an, established, english, dissenting, family, who, did, not, conform, to, the, church, of, england, he, was, the, oldest, of, six, children, born, to, mary, swift, and, jonas, priestley, a, finisher, of, cloth, priestley, was, sent, to, live, with, his, grandfather, around, the, age, of, one, he, returned, home, five, years, later, after, his, mother, died, when, his, father, remarried, in, 1741, priestley, went, to, live, with, his, aunt, and, uncle, the, wealthy, and, childless, sarah, d, 1764, and, john, keighley, 3, miles, 4, 8, km, from, fieldhead, priestley, was, a, precocious, child, at, the, age, of, four, he, could, flawlessly, recite, all, 107, questions, and, answers, of, the, westminster, shorter, catechism, and, his, aunt, sought, the, best, education, for, him, intending, him, to, enter, ministry, during, his, youth, priestley, attended, local, schools, where, he, learned, greek, latin, and, hebrew, around, 1749, priestley, became, seriously, ill, and, believed, he, was, dying, raised, as, a, devout, calvinist, he, believed, a, conversion, experience, was, necessary, for, salvation, but, doubted, he, had, had, one, this, emotional, distress, eventually, led, him, to, question, his, theological, upbringing, causing, him, to, reject, election, and, to, accept, universal, salvation, as, a, result, the, elders, of, his, home, church, the, independent, upper, chapel, of, heckmondwike, near, leeds, refused, him, admission, as, a, full, member, priestley, s, illness, left, him, with, a, permanent, stutter, and, he, gave, up, any, thoughts, of, entering, the, ministry, at, that, time, in, preparation, for, joining, a, relative, in, trade, in, lisbon, he, studied, french, italian, and, german, in, addition, to, aramaic, and, arabic, he, was, tutored, by, the, reverend, george, haggerstone, who, first, introduced, him, to, higher, mathematics, natural, philosophy, logic, and, metaphysics, through, the, works, of, isaac, watts, willem, s, gravesande, and, john, locke, priestley, eventually, decided, to, return, to, his, theological, studies, and, in, 1752, matriculated, at, daventry, a, dissenting, academy, because, he, was, already, widely, read, priestley, was, allowed, to, omit, the, first, two, years, of, coursework, he, continued, his, intense, study, this, together, with, the, liberal, atmosphere, of, the, school, shifted, his, theology, further, leftward, and, he, became, a, rational, dissenter, abhorring, dogma, and, religious, mysticism, rational, dissenters, emphasised, rational, analysis, of, the, natural, world, and, the, bible, priestley, later, wrote, that, the, book, that, influenced, him, the, most, save, the, bible, was, david, hartley, s, observations, on, man, 1749, hartley, s, psychological, philosophical, and, theological, treatise, postulated, a, material, theory, of, mind, hartley, aimed, to, construct, a, christian, philosophy, in, which, both, religious, and, moral, facts, could, be, scientifically, proven, a, goal, that, would, occupy, priestley, for, his, entire, life, in, his, third, year, at, daventry, priestley, committed, himself, to, the, ministry, which, he, described, as, the, noblest, of, all, professions, robert, schofield, priestley, s, major, modern, biographer, describes, his, first, call, in, 1755, to, the, dissenting, parish, in, needham, market, suffolk, as, a, mistake, for, both, priestley, and, the, congregation, priestley, yearned, for, urban, life, and, theological, debate, whereas, needham, market, was, a, small, rural, town, with, a, congregation, wedded, to, tradition, attendance, and, donations, dropped, sharply, when, they, discovered, the, extent, of, his, heterodoxy, although, priestley, s, aunt, had, promised, her, support, if, he, became, a, minister, she, refused, any, further, assistance, when, she, realised, he, was, no, longer, a, calvinist, to, earn, extra, money, priestley, proposed, opening, a, school, but, local, families, informed, him, that, they, would, refuse, to, send, their, children, he, also, presented, a, series, of, scientific, lectures, titled, use, of, the, globes, that, was, more, successful, priestley, s, daventry, friends, helped, him, obtain, another, position, and, in, 1758, he, moved, to, nantwich, cheshire, living, at, sweetbriar, hall, in, the, town, s, hospital, street, his, time, there, was, happier, the, congregation, cared, less, about, priestley, s, heterodoxy, and, he, successfully, established, a, school, unlike, many, schoolmasters, of, the, time, priestley, taught, his, students, natural, philosophy, and, even, bought, scientific, instruments, for, them, appalled, at, the, quality, of, the, available, english, grammar, books, priestley, wrote, his, own, the, rudiments, of, english, grammar, 1761, his, innovations, in, the, description, of, english, grammar, particularly, his, efforts, to, dissociate, it, from, latin, grammar, led, 20th, century, scholars, to, describe, him, as, one, of, the, great, grammarians, of, his, time, after, the, publication, of, rudiments, and, the, success, of, priestley, s, school, warrington, academy, offered, him, a, teaching, position, in, 1761, in, 1761, priestley, moved, to, warrington, in, cheshire, and, assumed, the, post, of, tutor, of, modern, languages, and, rhetoric, at, the, town, s, dissenting, academy, although, he, would, have, preferred, to, teach, mathematics, and, natural, philosophy, he, fitted, in, well, at, warrington, and, made, friends, quickly, these, included, the, doctor, and, writer, john, aikin, his, sister, the, children, s, author, anna, laetitia, aikin, and, the, potter, and, businessman, josiah, wedgwood, wedgwood, met, priestley, in, 1762, after, a, fall, from, his, horse, wedgwood, and, priestley, met, rarely, but, exchanged, letters, advice, on, chemistry, and, laboratory, equipment, wedgwood, eventually, created, a, medallion, of, priestley, in, cream, on, blue, jasperware, 37, on, 23, june, 1762, priestley, married, mary, wilkinson, of, wrexham, of, his, marriage, priestley, wrote, this, proved, a, very, suitable, and, happy, connexion, my, wife, being, a, woman, of, an, excellent, understanding, much, improved, by, reading, of, great, fortitude, and, strength, of, mind, and, of, a, temper, in, the, highest, degree, affectionate, and, generous, feeling, strongly, for, others, and, little, for, herself, also, greatly, excelling, in, every, thing, relating, to, household, affairs, she, entirely, relieved, me, of, all, concern, of, that, kind, which, allowed, me, to, give, all, my, time, to, the, prosecution, of, my, studies, and, the, other, duties, of, my, station, on, 17, april, 1763, they, had, a, daughter, whom, they, named, sarah, after, priestley, s, aunt, all, of, the, books, priestley, published, while, at, warrington, emphasised, the, study, of, history, priestley, considered, it, essential, for, worldly, success, as, well, as, religious, growth, he, wrote, histories, of, science, and, christianity, in, an, effort, to, reveal, the, progress, of, humanity, and, paradoxically, the, loss, of, a, pure, primitive, christianity, in, his, essay, on, a, course, of, liberal, education, for, civil, and, active, life, 1765, lectures, on, history, and, general, policy, 1788, and, other, works, priestley, argued, that, the, education, of, the, young, should, anticipate, their, future, practical, needs, this, principle, of, utility, guided, his, unconventional, curricular, choices, for, warrington, s, aspiring, middle, class, students, he, recommended, modern, languages, instead, of, classical, languages, and, modern, rather, than, ancient, history, priestley, s, lectures, on, history, were, particularly, revolutionary, he, narrated, a, providentialist, and, naturalist, account, of, history, arguing, that, the, study, of, history, furthered, the, comprehension, of, god, s, natural, laws, furthermore, his, millennial, perspective, was, closely, tied, to, his, optimism, regarding, scientific, progress, and, the, improvement, of, humanity, he, believed, that, each, age, would, improve, upon, the, previous, and, that, the, study, of, history, allowed, people, to, perceive, and, to, advance, this, progress, since, the, study, of, history, was, a, moral, imperative, for, priestley, he, also, promoted, the, education, of, middle, class, women, which, was, unusual, at, the, time, some, scholars, of, education, have, described, priestley, as, the, most, important, english, writer, on, education, between, the, 17th, century, john, locke, and, the, 19th, century, herbert, spencer, lectures, on, history, was, well, received, and, was, employed, by, many, educational, institutions, such, as, new, college, at, hackney, brown, princeton, yale, and, cambridge, priestley, designed, two, charts, to, serve, as, visual, study, aids, for, his, lectures, these, charts, are, in, fact, timelines, they, have, been, described, as, the, most, influential, timelines, published, in, the, 18th, century, both, were, popular, for, decades, and, the, trustees, of, warrington, were, so, impressed, with, priestley, s, lectures, and, charts, that, they, arranged, for, the, university, of, edinburgh, to, grant, him, a, doctor, of, law, degree, in, 1764, during, this, period, priestley, also, regularly, delivered, lectures, on, rhetoric, that, were, later, published, in, 1777, as, a, course, of, lectures, on, oratory, and, criticism, the, intellectually, stimulating, atmosphere, of, warrington, often, called, the, athens, of, the, north, of, england, during, the, 18th, century, encouraged, priestley, s, growing, interest, in, natural, philosophy, he, gave, lectures, on, anatomy, and, performed, experiments, regarding, temperature, with, another, tutor, at, warrington, his, friend, john, seddon, despite, priestley, s, busy, teaching, schedule, he, decided, to, write, a, history, of, electricity, friends, introduced, him, to, the, major, experimenters, in, the, field, in, britain, john, canton, william, watson, timothy, lane, and, the, visiting, benjamin, franklin, who, encouraged, priestley, to, perform, the, experiments, he, wanted, to, include, in, his, history, priestley, also, consulted, with, franklin, during, the, latter, s, kite, experiments, in, the, process, of, replicating, others, experiments, priestley, became, intrigued, by, unanswered, questions, and, was, prompted, to, undertake, experiments, of, his, own, design, impressed, with, his, charts, and, the, manuscript, of, his, history, of, electricity, canton, franklin, watson, and, richard, price, nominated, priestley, for, a, fellowship, in, the, royal, society, he, was, accepted, in, 1766, in, 1767, the, 700, page, the, history, and, present, state, of, electricity, was, published, to, positive, reviews, the, first, half, of, the, text, is, a, history, of, the, study, of, electricity, to, 1766, the, second, and, more, influential, half, is, a, description, of, contemporary, theories, about, electricity, and, suggestions, for, future, research, the, volume, also, contains, extensive, comments, on, priestley, s, views, that, scientific, inquiries, be, presented, with, all, reasoning, in, one, s, discovery, path, including, false, leads, and, mistakes, he, contrasted, his, narrative, approach, with, newton, s, analytical, proof, like, approach, which, did, not, facilitate, future, researchers, to, continue, the, inquiry, priestley, reported, some, of, his, own, discoveries, in, the, second, section, such, as, the, conductivity, of, charcoal, and, other, substances, and, the, continuum, between, conductors, and, non, conductors, this, discovery, overturned, what, he, described, as, one, of, the, earliest, and, universally, received, maxims, of, electricity, that, only, water, and, metals, could, conduct, electricity, this, and, other, experiments, on, the, electrical, properties, of, materials, and, on, the, electrical, effects, of, chemical, transformations, demonstrated, priestley, s, early, and, ongoing, interest, in, the, relationship, between, chemical, substances, and, electricity, based, on, experiments, with, charged, spheres, priestley, was, among, the, first, to, propose, that, electrical, force, followed, an, inverse, square, law, similar, to, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, he, did, not, generalise, or, elaborate, on, this, and, the, general, law, was, enunciated, by, french, physicist, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, in, the, 1780s, priestley, s, strength, as, a, natural, philosopher, was, qualitative, rather, than, quantitative, and, his, observation, of, a, current, of, real, air, between, two, electrified, points, would, later, interest, michael, faraday, and, james, clerk, maxwell, as, they, investigated, electromagnetism, priestley, s, text, became, the, standard, history, of, electricity, for, over, a, century, alessandro, volta, who, later, invented, the, battery, william, herschel, who, discovered, infrared, radiation, and, henry, cavendish, who, discovered, hydrogen, all, relied, upon, it, priestley, wrote, a, popular, version, of, the, history, of, electricity, for, the, general, public, titled, a, familiar, introduction, to, the, study, of, electricity, 1768, he, marketed, the, book, with, his, brother, timothy, but, unsuccessfully, perhaps, prompted, by, mary, priestley, s, ill, health, or, financial, problems, or, a, desire, to, prove, himself, to, the, community, that, had, rejected, him, in, his, childhood, priestley, moved, with, his, family, from, warrington, to, leeds, in, 1767, and, he, became, mill, hill, chapel, s, minister, two, sons, were, born, to, the, priestleys, in, leeds, joseph, junior, on, 24, july, 1768, and, william, three, years, later, theophilus, lindsey, a, rector, at, catterick, yorkshire, became, one, of, priestley, s, few, friends, in, leeds, of, whom, he, wrote, i, never, chose, to, publish, any, thing, of, moment, relating, to, theology, without, consulting, him, although, priestley, had, extended, family, living, around, leeds, they, do, not, appear, to, have, communicated, schofield, conjectures, that, they, considered, him, a, heretic, each, year, priestley, travelled, to, london, to, consult, with, his, close, friend, and, publisher, joseph, johnson, and, to, attend, meetings, of, the, royal, society, when, priestley, became, its, minister, mill, hill, chapel, was, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, respected, dissenting, congregations, in, england, however, during, the, early, 18th, century, the, congregation, had, fractured, along, doctrinal, lines, and, was, losing, members, to, the, charismatic, methodist, movement, priestley, believed, that, he, could, strengthen, the, bonds, of, the, congregation, by, educating, the, young, people, there, in, his, three, volume, institutes, of, natural, and, revealed, religion, 1772, 74, priestley, outlined, his, theories, of, religious, instruction, more, importantly, he, laid, out, his, belief, in, socinianism, the, doctrines, he, explicated, would, become, the, standards, for, unitarians, in, britain, this, work, marked, a, change, in, priestley, s, theological, thinking, that, is, critical, to, understanding, his, later, writings, it, paved, the, way, for, his, materialism, and, necessitarianism, the, latter, being, the, belief, that, a, divine, being, acts, in, accordance, with, necessary, metaphysical, laws, priestley, s, major, argument, in, the, institutes, was, that, the, only, revealed, religious, truths, that, could, be, accepted, were, those, that, matched, one, s, experience, of, the, natural, world, since, his, views, of, religion, were, tied, deeply, to, his, understanding, of, nature, the, text, s, theism, rested, on, the, argument, from, design, the, institutes, shocked, and, appalled, many, readers, primarily, because, it, challenged, basic, christian, orthodoxies, such, as, the, divinity, of, christ, and, the, miracle, of, the, virgin, birth, methodists, in, leeds, penned, a, hymn, asking, god, to, the, unitarian, fiend, expel, and, chase, his, doctrine, back, to, hell, priestley, wanted, to, return, christianity, to, its, primitive, or, pure, form, by, eliminating, the, corruptions, which, had, accumulated, over, the, centuries, the, fourth, part, of, the, institutes, an, history, of, the, corruptions, of, christianity, became, so, long, that, he, was, forced, to, issue, it, separately, in, 1782, priestley, believed, that, the, corruptions, was, the, most, valuable, work, he, ever, published, in, demanding, that, his, readers, apply, the, logic, of, the, emerging, sciences, and, comparative, history, to, the, bible, and, christianity, he, alienated, religious, and, scientific, readers, alike, scientific, readers, did, not, appreciate, seeing, science, used, in, the, defence, of, religion, and, religious, readers, dismissed, the, application, of, science, to, religion, priestley, engaged, in, numerous, political, and, religious, pamphlet, wars, according, to, schofield, he, entered, each, controversy, with, a, cheerful, conviction, that, he, was, right, while, most, of, his, opponents, were, convinced, from, the, outset, that, he, was, willfully, and, maliciously, wrong, he, was, able, then, to, contrast, his, sweet, reasonableness, to, their, personal, rancor, but, as, schofield, points, out, priestley, rarely, altered, his, opinion, as, a, result, of, these, debates, while, at, leeds, he, wrote, controversial, pamphlets, on, the, lord, s, supper, and, on, calvinist, doctrine, thousands, of, copies, were, published, making, them, some, of, priestley, s, most, widely, read, works, priestley, founded, the, theological, repository, in, 1768, a, journal, committed, to, the, open, and, rational, inquiry, of, theological, questions, although, he, promised, to, print, any, contribution, only, like, minded, authors, submitted, articles, he, was, therefore, obliged, to, provide, much, of, the, journal, s, content, himself, this, material, also, became, the, basis, for, many, of, his, later, theological, and, metaphysical, works, after, only, a, few, years, due, to, a, lack, of, funds, he, was, forced, to, cease, publishing, the, journal, however, he, did, revive, it, briefly, in, 1784, with, similar, results, many, of, priestley, s, political, writings, supported, the, repeal, of, the, test, and, corporation, acts, which, restricted, the, rights, of, dissenters, they, could, not, hold, political, office, serve, in, the, armed, forces, or, attend, oxford, and, cambridge, unless, they, subscribed, to, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, the, church, of, england, dissenters, repeatedly, petitioned, parliament, to, repeal, the, acts, arguing, that, they, were, being, treated, as, second, class, citizens, priestley, s, friends, particularly, other, rational, dissenters, urged, him, to, publish, a, work, on, the, injustices, experienced, by, dissenters, the, result, was, his, essay, on, the, first, principles, of, government, 1768, an, early, work, of, modern, liberal, political, theory, and, priestley, s, most, thorough, treatment, of, the, subject, it, unusually, for, the, time, distinguished, political, rights, from, civil, rights, with, precision, and, argued, for, expansive, civil, rights, priestley, identified, separate, private, and, public, spheres, contending, that, the, government, should, have, control, only, over, the, public, sphere, education, and, religion, in, particular, he, maintained, were, matters, of, private, conscience, and, should, not, be, administered, by, the, state, priestley, s, later, radicalism, emerged, from, his, belief, that, the, british, government, was, infringing, upon, these, individual, freedoms, priestley, also, defended, the, rights, of, dissenters, against, the, attacks, of, william, blackstone, an, eminent, legal, theorist, whose, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, 1765, 69, had, become, the, standard, legal, guide, blackstone, s, book, stated, that, dissent, from, the, church, of, england, was, a, crime, and, that, dissenters, could, not, be, loyal, subjects, furious, priestley, lashed, out, with, his, remarks, on, dr, blackstone, s, commentaries, 1769, correcting, blackstone, s, interpretation, of, the, law, his, grammar, a, highly, politicised, subject, at, the, time, and, history, blackstone, chastened, altered, subsequent, editions, of, his, commentaries, he, rephrased, the, offending, passages, and, removed, the, sections, claiming, that, dissenters, could, not, be, loyal, subjects, but, he, retained, his, description, of, dissent, as, a, crime, although, priestley, claimed, that, natural, philosophy, was, only, a, hobby, he, took, it, seriously, in, his, history, of, electricity, he, described, the, scientist, as, promoting, the, security, and, happiness, of, mankind, priestley, s, science, was, eminently, practical, and, he, rarely, concerned, himself, with, theoretical, questions, his, model, was, his, close, friend, benjamin, franklin, when, he, moved, to, leeds, priestley, continued, his, electrical, and, chemical, experiments, the, latter, aided, by, a, steady, supply, of, carbon, dioxide, from, a, neighbouring, brewery, between, 1767, and, 1770, he, presented, five, papers, to, the, royal, society, from, these, initial, experiments, the, first, four, papers, explored, coronal, discharges, and, other, phenomena, related, to, electrical, discharge, while, the, fifth, reported, on, the, conductivity, of, charcoals, from, different, sources, his, subsequent, experimental, work, focused, on, chemistry, and, pneumatics, priestley, published, the, first, volume, of, his, projected, history, of, experimental, philosophy, the, history, and, present, state, of, discoveries, relating, to, vision, light, and, colours, referred, to, as, his, optics, in, 1772, he, paid, careful, attention, to, the, history, of, optics, and, presented, excellent, explanations, of, early, optics, experiments, but, his, mathematical, deficiencies, caused, him, to, dismiss, several, important, contemporary, theories, he, followed, the, corpuscular, particle, theory, of, light, influenced, by, the, works, of, reverend, john, rowning, and, others, furthermore, he, did, not, include, any, of, the, practical, sections, that, had, made, his, history, of, electricity, so, useful, to, practising, natural, philosophers, unlike, his, history, of, electricity, it, was, not, popular, and, had, only, one, edition, although, it, was, the, only, english, book, on, the, topic, for, 150, years, the, hastily, written, text, sold, poorly, the, cost, of, researching, writing, and, publishing, the, optics, convinced, priestley, to, abandon, his, history, of, experimental, philosophy, priestley, was, considered, for, the, position, of, astronomer, on, james, cook, s, second, voyage, to, the, south, seas, but, was, not, chosen, still, he, contributed, in, a, small, way, to, the, voyage, he, provided, the, crew, with, a, method, for, making, carbonated, water, which, he, erroneously, speculated, might, be, a, cure, for, scurvy, he, then, published, a, pamphlet, with, directions, for, impregnating, water, with, fixed, air, 1772, priestley, did, not, exploit, the, commercial, potential, of, carbonated, water, but, others, such, as, j, j, schweppe, made, fortunes, from, it, for, his, discovery, of, carbonated, water, priestley, has, been, labelled, the, father, of, the, soft, drink, with, the, beverage, company, schweppes, regarding, him, as, the, father, of, our, industry, in, 1773, the, royal, society, recognised, priestley, s, achievements, in, natural, philosophy, by, awarding, him, the, copley, medal, priestley, s, friends, wanted, to, find, him, a, more, financially, secure, position, in, 1772, prompted, by, richard, price, and, benjamin, franklin, lord, shelburne, wrote, to, priestley, asking, him, to, direct, the, education, of, his, children, and, to, act, as, his, general, assistant, although, priestley, was, reluctant, to, sacrifice, his, ministry, he, accepted, the, position, resigning, from, mill, hill, chapel, on, 20, december, 1772, and, preaching, his, last, sermon, on, 16, may, 1773, in, 1773, the, priestleys, moved, to, calne, in, wiltshire, and, a, year, later, lord, shelburne, and, priestley, took, a, tour, of, europe, according, to, priestley, s, close, friend, theophilus, lindsey, priestley, was, much, improved, by, this, view, of, mankind, at, large, upon, their, return, priestley, easily, fulfilled, his, duties, as, librarian, and, tutor, the, workload, was, intentionally, light, allowing, him, time, to, pursue, his, scientific, investigations, and, theological, interests, priestley, also, became, a, political, adviser, to, shelburne, gathering, information, on, parliamentary, issues, and, serving, as, a, liaison, between, shelburne, and, the, dissenting, and, american, interests, when, the, priestleys, third, son, was, born, on, 24, may, 1777, they, named, him, henry, at, the, lord, s, request, priestley, wrote, his, most, important, philosophical, works, during, his, years, with, lord, shelburne, in, a, series, of, major, metaphysical, texts, published, between, 1774, and, 1780, an, examination, of, dr, reid, s, inquiry, into, the, human, mind, 1774, hartley, s, theory, of, the, human, mind, on, the, principle, of, the, association, of, ideas, 1775, disquisitions, relating, to, matter, and, spirit, 1777, the, doctrine, of, philosophical, necessity, illustrated, 1777, and, letters, to, a, philosophical, unbeliever, 1780, he, argues, for, a, philosophy, that, incorporates, four, concepts, determinism, materialism, causation, and, necessitarianism, by, studying, the, natural, world, he, argued, people, would, learn, how, to, become, more, compassionate, happy, and, prosperous, priestley, strongly, suggested, that, there, is, no, mind, body, duality, and, put, forth, a, materialist, philosophy, in, these, works, that, is, one, founded, on, the, principle, that, everything, in, the, universe, is, made, of, matter, that, we, can, perceive, he, also, contended, that, discussing, the, soul, is, impossible, because, it, is, made, of, a, divine, substance, and, humanity, cannot, perceive, the, divine, despite, his, separation, of, the, divine, from, the, mortal, this, position, shocked, and, angered, many, of, his, readers, who, believed, that, such, a, duality, was, necessary, for, the, soul, to, exist, responding, to, baron, d, holbach, s, syst, me, de, la, nature, 1770, and, david, hume, s, dialogues, concerning, natural, religion, 1779, as, well, as, the, works, of, the, french, philosophers, priestley, maintained, that, materialism, and, determinism, could, be, reconciled, with, a, belief, in, god, he, criticised, those, whose, faith, was, shaped, by, books, and, fashion, drawing, an, analogy, between, the, scepticism, of, educated, men, and, the, credulity, of, the, masses, maintaining, that, humans, had, no, free, will, priestley, argued, that, what, he, called, philosophical, necessity, akin, to, absolute, determinism, is, consonant, with, christianity, a, position, based, on, his, understanding, of, the, natural, world, like, the, rest, of, nature, man, s, mind, is, subject, to, the, laws, of, causation, priestley, contended, but, because, a, benevolent, god, created, these, laws, the, world, and, the, people, in, it, will, eventually, be, perfected, evil, is, therefore, only, an, imperfect, understanding, of, the, world, although, priestley, s, philosophical, work, has, been, characterised, as, audacious, and, original, it, partakes, of, older, philosophical, traditions, on, the, problems, of, free, will, determinism, and, materialism, for, example, the, 17th, century, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, argued, for, absolute, determinism, and, absolute, materialism, like, spinoza, and, priestley, leibniz, argued, that, human, will, was, completely, determined, by, natural, laws, unlike, them, leibniz, argued, for, a, parallel, universe, of, immaterial, objects, such, as, human, souls, so, arranged, by, god, that, its, outcomes, agree, exactly, with, those, of, the, material, universe, leibniz, and, priestley, share, an, optimism, that, god, has, chosen, the, chain, of, events, benevolently, however, priestley, believed, that, the, events, were, leading, to, a, glorious, millennial, conclusion, whereas, for, leibniz, the, entire, chain, of, events, was, optimal, in, and, of, itself, as, compared, with, other, conceivable, chains, of, events, when, priestley, s, friend, theophilus, lindsey, decided, to, found, a, new, christian, denomination, that, would, not, restrict, its, members, beliefs, priestley, and, others, hurried, to, his, aid, on, 17, april, 1774, lindsey, held, the, first, unitarian, service, in, britain, at, the, newly, formed, essex, street, chapel, in, london, he, had, even, designed, his, own, liturgy, of, which, many, were, critical, priestley, defended, his, friend, in, the, pamphlet, letter, to, a, layman, on, the, subject, of, the, rev, mr, lindsey, s, proposal, for, a, reformed, english, church, 1774, claiming, that, only, the, form, of, worship, had, been, altered, not, its, substance, and, attacking, those, who, followed, religion, as, a, fashion, priestley, attended, lindsey, s, church, regularly, in, the, 1770s, and, occasionally, preached, there, he, continued, to, support, institutionalised, unitarianism, for, the, rest, of, his, life, writing, several, defenses, of, unitarianism, and, encouraging, the, foundation, of, new, unitarian, chapels, throughout, britain, and, the, united, states, priestley, s, years, in, calne, were, the, only, ones, in, his, life, dominated, by, scientific, investigations, they, were, also, the, most, scientifically, fruitful, his, experiments, were, almost, entirely, confined, to, airs, and, out, of, this, work, emerged, his, most, important, scientific, texts, the, six, volumes, of, experiments, and, observations, on, different, kinds, of, air, 1774, 86, these, experiments, helped, repudiate, the, last, vestiges, of, the, theory, of, four, elements, which, priestley, attempted, to, replace, with, his, own, variation, of, phlogiston, theory, according, to, that, 18th, century, theory, the, combustion, or, oxidation, of, a, substance, corresponded, to, the, release, of, a, material, substance, phlogiston, priestley, s, work, on, airs, is, not, easily, classified, as, historian, of, science, simon, schaffer, writes, it, has, been, seen, as, a, branch, of, physics, or, chemistry, or, natural, philosophy, or, some, highly, idiosyncratic, version, of, priestley, s, own, invention, furthermore, the, volumes, were, both, a, scientific, and, a, political, enterprise, for, priestley, in, which, he, argues, that, science, could, destroy, undue, and, usurped, authority, and, that, government, has, reason, to, tremble, even, at, an, air, pump, or, an, electrical, machine, volume, i, of, experiments, and, observations, on, different, kinds, of, air, outlined, several, discoveries, nitrous, air, nitric, oxide, no, vapor, of, spirit, of, salt, later, called, acid, air, or, marine, acid, air, anhydrous, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, alkaline, air, ammonia, nh, 3, diminished, or, dephlogisticated, nitrous, air, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, and, most, famously, dephlogisticated, air, oxygen, o, 2, as, well, as, experimental, findings, that, showed, plants, revitalised, enclosed, volumes, of, air, a, discovery, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, discovery, of, photosynthesis, by, jan, ingenhousz, priestley, also, developed, a, nitrous, air, test, to, determine, the, goodness, of, air, using, a, pneumatic, trough, he, would, mix, nitrous, air, with, a, test, sample, over, water, or, mercury, and, measure, the, decrease, in, volume, the, principle, of, eudiometry, after, a, small, history, of, the, study, of, airs, he, explained, his, own, experiments, in, an, open, and, sincere, style, as, an, early, biographer, writes, whatever, he, knows, or, thinks, he, tells, doubts, perplexities, blunders, are, set, down, with, the, most, refreshing, candour, priestley, also, described, his, cheap, and, easy, to, assemble, experimental, apparatus, his, colleagues, therefore, believed, that, they, could, easily, reproduce, his, experiments, faced, with, inconsistent, experimental, results, priestley, employed, phlogiston, theory, this, led, him, to, conclude, that, there, were, only, three, types, of, air, fixed, alkaline, and, acid, priestley, dismissed, the, burgeoning, chemistry, of, his, day, instead, he, focused, on, gases, and, changes, in, their, sensible, properties, as, had, natural, philosophers, before, him, he, isolated, carbon, monoxide, co, but, apparently, did, not, realise, that, it, was, a, separate, air, in, august, 1774, he, isolated, an, air, that, appeared, to, be, completely, new, but, he, did, not, have, an, opportunity, to, pursue, the, matter, because, he, was, about, to, tour, europe, with, shelburne, while, in, paris, priestley, replicated, the, experiment, for, others, including, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, after, returning, to, britain, in, january, 1775, he, continued, his, experiments, and, discovered, vitriolic, acid, air, sulphur, dioxide, so, 2, in, march, he, wrote, to, several, people, regarding, the, new, air, that, he, had, discovered, in, august, one, of, these, letters, was, read, aloud, to, the, royal, society, and, a, paper, outlining, the, discovery, titled, an, account, of, further, discoveries, in, air, was, published, in, the, society, s, journal, philosophical, transactions, priestley, called, the, new, substance, dephlogisticated, air, which, he, made, in, the, famous, experiment, by, focusing, the, sun, s, rays, on, a, sample, of, mercuric, oxide, he, first, tested, it, on, mice, who, surprised, him, by, surviving, quite, a, while, entrapped, with, the, air, and, then, on, himself, writing, that, it, was, five, or, six, times, better, than, common, air, for, the, purpose, of, respiration, inflammation, and, i, believe, every, other, use, of, common, atmospherical, air, he, had, discovered, oxygen, gas, o, 2, priestley, assembled, his, oxygen, paper, and, several, others, into, a, second, volume, of, experiments, and, observations, on, air, published, in, 1776, he, did, not, emphasise, his, discovery, of, dephlogisticated, air, leaving, it, to, part, iii, of, the, volume, but, instead, argued, in, the, preface, how, important, such, discoveries, were, to, rational, religion, his, paper, narrated, the, discovery, chronologically, relating, the, long, delays, between, experiments, and, his, initial, puzzlements, thus, it, is, difficult, to, determine, when, exactly, priestley, discovered, oxygen, such, dating, is, significant, as, both, lavoisier, and, swedish, pharmacist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, have, strong, claims, to, the, discovery, of, oxygen, as, well, scheele, having, been, the, first, to, isolate, the, gas, although, he, published, after, priestley, and, lavoisier, having, been, the, first, to, describe, it, as, purified, air, itself, entire, without, alteration, that, is, the, first, to, explain, oxygen, without, phlogiston, theory, in, his, paper, observations, on, respiration, and, the, use, of, the, blood, priestley, was, the, first, to, suggest, a, connection, between, blood, and, air, although, he, did, so, using, phlogiston, theory, in, typical, priestley, fashion, he, prefaced, the, paper, with, a, history, of, the, study, of, respiration, a, year, later, clearly, influenced, by, priestley, lavoisier, was, also, discussing, respiration, at, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, lavoisier, s, work, began, the, long, train, of, discovery, that, produced, papers, on, oxygen, respiration, and, culminated, in, the, overthrow, of, phlogiston, theory, and, the, establishment, of, modern, chemistry, around, 1779, priestley, and, shelburne, soon, to, be, the, 1st, marquess, of, landsdowne, had, a, rupture, the, precise, reasons, for, which, remain, unclear, shelburne, blamed, priestley, s, health, while, priestley, claimed, shelburne, had, no, further, use, for, him, some, contemporaries, speculated, that, priestley, s, outspokenness, had, hurt, shelburne, s, political, career, schofield, argues, that, the, most, likely, reason, was, shelburne, s, recent, marriage, to, louisa, fitzpatrick, apparently, she, did, not, like, the, priestleys, although, priestley, considered, moving, to, america, he, eventually, accepted, birmingham, new, meeting, s, offer, to, be, their, minister, both, priestley, and, shelburne, s, families, upheld, their, unitarian, faith, for, generations, in, december, 2013, it, was, reported, that, sir, christopher, bullock, a, direct, descendant, of, shelburne, s, brother, thomas, fitzmaurice, mp, had, married, his, wife, lady, bullock, n, e, barbara, may, lupton, at, london, s, unitarian, essex, church, in, 1917, barbara, lupton, was, the, second, cousin, of, olive, middleton, n, e, lupton, the, great, grandmother, of, catherine, duchess, of, cambridge, in, 1914, olive, and, noel, middleton, had, married, at, leeds, mill, hill, chapel, which, priestley, as, its, minister, had, once, guided, towards, unitarianism, in, 1780, the, priestleys, moved, to, birmingham, and, spent, a, happy, decade, surrounded, by, old, friends, until, they, were, forced, to, flee, in, 1791, by, religiously, motivated, mob, violence, in, what, became, known, as, the, priestley, riots, priestley, accepted, the, ministerial, position, at, new, meeting, on, the, condition, that, he, be, required, to, preach, and, teach, only, on, sundays, so, that, he, would, have, time, for, his, writing, and, scientific, experiments, as, in, leeds, priestley, established, classes, for, the, youth, of, his, parish, and, by, 1781, he, was, teaching, 150, students, because, priestley, s, new, meeting, salary, was, only, 100, guineas, friends, and, patrons, donated, money, and, goods, to, help, continue, his, investigations, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1782, many, of, the, friends, that, priestley, made, in, birmingham, were, members, of, the, lunar, society, a, group, of, manufacturers, inventors, and, natural, philosophers, who, assembled, monthly, to, discuss, their, work, the, core, of, the, group, included, men, such, as, the, manufacturer, matthew, boulton, the, chemist, and, geologist, james, keir, the, inventor, and, engineer, james, watt, and, the, botanist, chemist, and, geologist, william, withering, priestley, was, asked, to, join, this, unique, society, and, contributed, much, to, the, work, of, its, members, as, a, result, of, this, stimulating, intellectual, environment, he, published, several, important, scientific, papers, including, experiments, relating, to, phlogiston, and, the, seeming, conversion, of, water, into, air, 1783, the, first, part, attempts, to, refute, lavoisier, s, challenges, to, his, work, on, oxygen, the, second, part, describes, how, steam, is, converted, into, air, after, several, variations, of, the, experiment, with, different, substances, as, fuel, and, several, different, collecting, apparatuses, which, produced, different, results, he, concluded, that, air, could, travel, through, more, substances, than, previously, surmised, a, conclusion, contrary, to, all, the, known, principles, of, hydrostatics, this, discovery, along, with, his, earlier, work, on, what, would, later, be, recognised, as, gaseous, diffusion, would, eventually, lead, john, dalton, and, thomas, graham, to, formulate, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, in, 1777, antoine, lavoisier, had, written, m, moire, sur, la, combustion, en, g, n, ral, the, first, of, what, proved, to, be, a, series, of, attacks, on, phlogiston, theory, it, was, against, these, attacks, that, priestley, responded, in, 1783, while, priestley, accepted, parts, of, lavoisier, s, theory, he, was, unprepared, to, assent, to, the, major, revolutions, lavoisier, proposed, the, overthrow, of, phlogiston, a, chemistry, based, conceptually, on, elements, and, compounds, and, a, new, chemical, nomenclature, priestley, s, original, experiments, on, dephlogisticated, air, oxygen, combustion, and, water, provided, lavoisier, with, the, data, he, needed, to, construct, much, of, his, system, yet, priestley, never, accepted, lavoisier, s, new, theories, and, continued, to, defend, phlogiston, theory, for, the, rest, of, his, life, lavoisier, s, system, was, based, largely, on, the, quantitative, concept, that, mass, is, neither, created, nor, destroyed, in, chemical, reactions, i, e, the, conservation, of, mass, by, contrast, priestley, preferred, to, observe, qualitative, changes, in, heat, colour, and, particularly, volume, his, experiments, tested, airs, for, their, solubility, in, water, their, power, of, supporting, or, extinguishing, flame, whether, they, were, respirable, how, they, behaved, with, acid, and, alkaline, air, and, with, nitric, oxide, and, inflammable, air, and, lastly, how, they, were, affected, by, the, electric, spark, by, 1789, when, lavoisier, published, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, and, founded, the, annales, de, chimie, the, new, chemistry, had, come, into, its, own, priestley, published, several, more, scientific, papers, in, birmingham, the, majority, attempting, to, refute, lavoisier, priestley, and, other, lunar, society, members, argued, that, the, new, french, system, was, too, expensive, too, difficult, to, test, and, unnecessarily, complex, priestley, in, particular, rejected, its, establishment, aura, in, the, end, lavoisier, s, view, prevailed, his, new, chemistry, introduced, many, of, the, principles, on, which, modern, chemistry, is, founded, priestley, s, refusal, to, accept, lavoisier, s, new, chemistry, such, as, the, conservation, of, mass, and, his, determination, to, adhere, to, a, less, satisfactory, theory, has, perplexed, many, scholars, schofield, explains, it, thus, priestley, was, never, a, chemist, in, a, modern, and, even, a, lavoisierian, sense, he, was, never, a, scientist, he, was, a, natural, philosopher, concerned, with, the, economy, of, nature, and, obsessed, with, an, idea, of, unity, in, theology, and, in, nature, historian, of, science, john, mcevoy, largely, agrees, writing, that, priestley, s, view, of, nature, as, coextensive, with, god, and, thus, infinite, which, encouraged, him, to, focus, on, facts, over, hypotheses, and, theories, prompted, him, to, reject, lavoisier, s, system, mcevoy, argues, that, priestley, s, isolated, and, lonely, opposition, to, the, oxygen, theory, was, a, measure, of, his, passionate, concern, for, the, principles, of, intellectual, freedom, epistemic, equality, and, critical, inquiry, priestley, himself, claimed, in, the, last, volume, of, experiments, and, observations, that, his, most, valuable, works, were, his, theological, ones, because, they, were, superior, dignity, and, importance, although, priestley, spent, much, of, this, time, defending, phlogiston, theory, from, the, new, chemists, most, of, what, he, published, in, birmingham, was, theological, for, example, in, 1782, he, published, the, fourth, volume, of, his, institutes, an, history, of, the, corruptions, of, christianity, describing, how, he, thought, the, teachings, of, the, early, christian, church, had, been, corrupted, or, distorted, schofield, describes, the, work, as, derivative, disorganized, wordy, and, repetitive, detailed, exhaustive, and, devastatingly, argued, the, text, addresses, issues, ranging, from, the, divinity, of, christ, to, the, proper, form, for, the, lord, s, supper, in, 1786, priestley, published, its, provocatively, titled, sequel, an, history, of, early, opinions, concerning, jesus, christ, compiled, from, original, writers, proving, that, the, christian, church, was, at, first, unitarian, thomas, jefferson, later, wrote, of, the, profound, effect, that, these, two, books, had, on, him, i, have, read, his, corruptions, of, christianity, and, early, opinions, of, jesus, over, and, over, again, and, i, rest, on, them, as, the, basis, of, my, own, faith, these, writings, have, never, been, answered, although, a, few, readers, such, as, jefferson, and, other, rational, dissenters, approved, of, the, work, many, others, reviewed, it, harshly, because, of, its, extreme, theological, positions, particularly, its, rejection, of, the, trinity, in, 1785, while, priestley, was, engaged, in, a, pamphlet, war, over, corruptions, he, also, published, the, importance, and, extent, of, free, enquiry, claiming, that, the, reformation, had, not, really, reformed, the, church, in, words, that, would, boil, over, into, a, national, debate, he, challenged, his, readers, to, enact, change, let, us, not, therefore, be, discouraged, though, for, the, present, we, should, see, no, great, number, of, churches, professedly, unitarian, we, are, as, it, were, laying, gunpowder, grain, by, grain, under, the, old, building, of, error, and, superstition, which, a, single, spark, may, hereafter, inflame, so, as, to, produce, an, instantaneous, explosion, in, consequence, of, which, that, edifice, the, erection, of, which, has, been, the, work, of, ages, may, be, overturned, in, a, moment, and, so, effectually, as, that, the, same, foundation, can, never, be, built, upon, again, although, discouraged, by, friends, from, using, such, inflammatory, language, priestley, refused, to, back, down, from, his, opinions, in, print, and, he, included, it, forever, branding, himself, as, gunpowder, joe, after, the, publication, of, this, seeming, call, for, revolution, in, the, midst, of, the, french, revolution, pamphleteers, stepped, up, their, attacks, on, priestley, and, he, and, his, church, were, even, threatened, with, legal, action, in, 1787, 1789, and, 1790, dissenters, again, tried, to, repeal, the, test, and, corporation, acts, although, they, might, have, succeeded, initially, by, 1790, with, the, fears, of, revolution, looming, in, parliament, few, were, swayed, by, appeals, to, equal, rights, political, cartoons, one, of, the, most, effective, and, popular, media, of, the, time, skewered, the, dissenters, and, priestley, in, parliament, william, pitt, and, edmund, burke, argued, against, the, repeal, a, betrayal, that, angered, priestley, and, his, friends, who, had, expected, the, two, men, s, support, priestley, wrote, a, series, of, letters, to, william, pitt, and, letters, to, burke, dissenters, such, as, priestley, who, supported, the, french, revolution, came, under, increasing, suspicion, as, scepticism, regarding, the, revolution, grew, in, its, propaganda, against, radicals, pitt, s, administration, used, the, gunpowder, statement, to, argue, that, priestley, and, other, dissenters, wanted, to, overthrow, the, government, burke, in, his, famous, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, tied, natural, philosophers, and, specifically, priestley, to, the, french, revolution, writing, that, radicals, who, supported, science, in, britain, considered, man, in, their, experiments, no, more, than, they, do, mice, in, an, air, pump, burke, also, associated, republican, principles, with, alchemy, and, insubstantial, air, mocking, the, scientific, work, done, by, both, priestley, and, french, chemists, he, made, much, in, his, later, writings, of, the, connections, between, gunpowder, joe, science, and, lavoisier, who, was, improving, gunpowder, for, the, french, in, their, war, against, britain, paradoxically, a, secular, statesman, burke, argued, against, science, and, maintained, that, religion, should, be, the, basis, of, civil, society, whereas, a, dissenting, minister, priestley, argued, that, religion, could, not, provide, the, basis, for, civil, society, and, should, be, restricted, to, one, s, private, life, priestley, also, supported, the, campaign, to, abolish, the, british, slave, trade, and, published, a, sermon, in, 1788, in, which, he, declared, that, nobody, treated, enslaved, people, with, so, much, cruelty, as, the, english, the, animus, that, had, been, building, against, dissenters, and, supporters, of, the, american, and, french, revolutions, exploded, in, july, 1791, priestley, and, several, other, dissenters, had, arranged, to, have, a, celebratory, dinner, on, bastille, day, the, anniversary, of, the, storming, of, the, bastille, a, provocative, action, in, a, country, where, many, disapproved, of, the, french, revolution, and, feared, that, it, might, spread, to, britain, amid, fears, of, violence, priestley, was, convinced, by, his, friends, not, to, attend, rioters, gathered, outside, the, hotel, during, the, banquet, and, attacked, the, attendees, as, they, left, the, rioters, moved, on, to, the, new, meeting, and, old, meeting, churches, and, burned, both, to, the, ground, priestley, and, his, wife, fled, from, their, home, although, their, son, william, and, others, stayed, behind, to, protect, their, property, the, mob, overcame, them, and, torched, priestley, s, house, fairhill, at, sparkbrook, destroying, his, valuable, laboratory, and, all, of, the, family, s, belongings, twenty, six, other, dissenters, homes, and, three, more, churches, were, burned, in, the, three, day, riot, priestley, spent, several, days, hiding, with, friends, until, he, was, able, to, travel, safely, to, london, the, carefully, executed, attacks, of, the, mob, and, the, farcical, trials, of, only, a, handful, of, the, leaders, convinced, many, at, the, time, and, modern, historians, later, that, the, attacks, were, planned, and, condoned, by, local, birmingham, magistrates, when, george, iii, was, eventually, forced, to, send, troops, to, the, area, he, said, i, cannot, but, feel, better, pleased, that, priestley, is, the, sufferer, for, the, doctrines, he, and, his, party, have, instilled, and, that, the, people, see, them, in, their, true, light, lo, priestley, there, patriot, and, saint, and, sage, him, full, of, years, from, his, loved, native, land, statesmen, blood, stained, and, priests, idolatrous, by, dark, lies, maddening, the, blind, multitude, drove, with, vain, hate, from, religious, musings, 1796, by, samuel, taylor, coleridge, unable, to, return, to, birmingham, the, priestleys, eventually, settled, in, lower, clapton, a, district, in, hackney, middlesex, where, he, gave, a, series, of, lectures, on, history, and, natural, philosophy, at, the, dissenting, academy, the, new, college, at, hackney, friends, helped, the, couple, rebuild, their, lives, contributing, money, books, and, laboratory, equipment, priestley, tried, to, obtain, restitution, from, the, government, for, the, destruction, of, his, birmingham, property, but, he, was, never, fully, reimbursed, he, also, published, an, appeal, to, the, public, on, the, subject, of, the, riots, in, birmingham, 1791, which, indicted, the, people, of, birmingham, for, allowing, the, riots, to, occur, and, for, violating, the, principles, of, english, government, the, couple, s, friends, urged, them, to, leave, britain, and, emigrate, to, either, france, or, the, new, united, states, even, though, priestley, had, received, an, appointment, to, preach, for, the, gravel, pit, meeting, congregation, priestley, was, minister, between, 1793, and, 1794, and, the, sermons, he, preached, there, particularly, the, two, fast, sermons, reflect, his, growing, millenarianism, his, belief, that, the, end, of, the, world, was, fast, approaching, after, comparing, biblical, prophecies, to, recent, history, priestley, concluded, that, the, french, revolution, was, a, harbinger, of, the, second, coming, of, christ, priestley, s, works, had, always, had, a, millennial, cast, but, after, the, beginning, of, the, french, revolution, this, strain, increased, he, wrote, to, a, younger, friend, that, while, he, himself, would, not, see, the, second, coming, his, friend, may, probably, live, to, see, it, it, cannot, i, think, be, more, than, twenty, years, daily, life, became, more, difficult, for, the, family, priestley, was, burned, in, effigy, along, with, thomas, paine, vicious, political, cartoons, continued, to, be, published, about, him, letters, were, sent, to, him, from, across, the, country, comparing, him, to, the, devil, and, guy, fawkes, tradespeople, feared, the, family, s, business, and, priestley, s, royal, academy, friends, distanced, themselves, as, the, penalties, became, harsher, for, those, who, spoke, out, against, the, government, priestley, examined, options, for, removing, himself, and, his, family, from, england, joseph, priestley, s, son, william, was, presented, to, the, french, assembly, and, granted, letters, of, naturalisation, on, 8, june, 1792, priestley, learned, about, it, from, the, morning, chronicle, a, decree, of, 26, august, 1792, by, the, french, national, assembly, conferred, french, citizenship, on, joseph, priestley, and, others, who, had, served, the, cause, of, liberty, by, their, writings, priestley, accepted, french, citizenship, considering, it, the, greatest, of, honours, in, the, french, national, convention, election, on, 5, september, 1792, joseph, priestley, was, elected, to, the, french, national, convention, by, at, least, two, departments, orne, and, rh, ne, et, loire, he, declined, the, honour, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, not, fluent, in, french, as, relations, between, england, and, france, worsened, a, removal, to, france, became, impracticable, following, the, declaration, of, war, of, february, 1793, and, the, aliens, bill, of, march, 1793, which, forbade, correspondence, or, travel, between, england, and, france, william, priestley, left, france, for, america, joseph, priestley, s, sons, harry, and, joseph, chose, to, leave, england, for, america, in, august, 1793, finally, priestley, himself, followed, with, his, wife, boarding, the, sansom, at, gravesend, on, 7, april, 1794, five, weeks, after, priestley, left, william, pitt, s, administration, began, arresting, radicals, for, seditious, libel, resulting, in, the, famous, 1794, treason, trials, the, priestleys, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 4, june, 1794, where, they, were, f, ted, by, various, political, factions, vying, for, priestley, s, endorsement, priestley, declined, their, entreaties, hoping, to, avoid, political, discord, in, his, new, country, before, travelling, to, a, new, home, in, the, backwoods, of, northumberland, county, pennsylvania, at, point, township, now, the, borough, of, northumberland, priestley, and, his, wife, lodged, in, philadelphia, where, he, gave, a, series, of, sermons, which, led, to, the, founding, of, the, first, unitarian, church, of, philadelphia, priestley, turned, down, an, opportunity, to, teach, chemistry, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, priestley, s, son, joseph, priestley, jr, was, a, leading, member, of, a, consortium, that, had, purchased, 300, 000, acres, 120, 000, ha, of, virgin, woodland, between, the, forks, of, loyalsock, creek, this, they, intended, to, lease, or, sell, in, 400, acre, 160, ha, plots, with, payment, deferred, to, seven, annual, instalments, with, interest, his, brothers, william, and, henry, bought, a, 284, acre, 115, ha, plot, of, woodland, which, they, attempted, to, transform, into, a, farm, later, called, fairhill, felling, and, uprooting, trees, and, making, lime, to, sweeten, the, soil, by, building, their, own, lime, kilns, henry, priestley, died, 11, december, 1795, possibly, of, malaria, which, he, may, have, contracted, after, landing, at, new, york, mary, priestley, s, health, already, poor, deteriorated, further, although, william, s, wife, margaret, foulke, priestley, moved, in, with, the, couple, to, nurse, mary, 24, hours, a, day, mary, priestley, died, 17, september, 1796, priestley, then, moved, in, with, his, elder, son, joseph, jr, and, his, wife, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, thomas, cooper, whose, son, thomas, jr, was, living, with, the, priestleys, was, a, frequent, visitor, since, his, arrival, in, america, priestley, had, continued, to, defend, his, christian, unitarian, beliefs, now, falling, increasingly, under, the, influence, of, thomas, cooper, and, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, he, was, unable, to, avoid, becoming, embroiled, in, political, controversy, in, 1798, when, in, response, to, the, pinckney, affair, a, belligerent, president, adams, sought, to, enlarge, the, navy, and, mobilise, the, militia, into, what, priestley, and, cooper, saw, as, a, standing, army, priestley, published, an, anonymous, newspaper, article, maxims, of, political, arithmetic, which, attacked, adams, defended, free, trade, and, advocated, a, form, of, jeffersonian, isolationism, in, the, same, year, a, small, package, addressed, vaguely, dr, priestley, in, america, was, seized, by, the, royal, navy, on, board, a, neutral, danish, boat, it, was, found, to, contain, three, letters, one, of, which, was, signed, by, the, radical, printer, john, hurford, stone, these, intercepted, letters, were, published, in, london, and, copied, in, numerous, papers, in, america, one, of, the, letters, was, addressed, to, mbp, with, a, note, i, inclose, a, note, for, our, friend, mbp, but, as, ignorant, of, the, name, he, bears, at, present, among, you, i, must, beg, you, to, seal, and, address, it, this, gave, the, intercepted, letters, a, tinge, of, intrigue, fearful, lest, they, be, taken, as, evidence, of, him, being, a, spy, in, the, interest, of, france, priestley, sent, a, clumsy, letter, to, numerous, newspaper, editors, in, which, he, naively, named, mbp, member, of, the, british, parliament, as, mr, benjamin, vaughan, who, like, me, thought, it, necessary, to, leave, england, and, for, some, time, is, said, to, have, assumed, a, feigned, name, william, cobbett, in, his, porcupine, s, gazette, 20, august, 1798, added, that, priestley, has, told, us, who, mr, mbp, is, and, has, confirmed, me, in, the, opinion, of, their, both, being, spies, in, the, interest, of, france, joseph, priestley, jr, left, on, a, visit, to, england, at, christmas, 1798, not, returning, until, august, 1800, in, his, absence, his, wife, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, and, thomas, cooper, became, increasing, close, collaborating, in, numerous, political, essays, priestley, allowed, himself, to, fall, too, heavily, under, elizabeth, and, cooper, s, influences, even, helping, hawk, a, seditious, handbill, cooper, had, printed, around, point, township, and, across, the, susquehanna, at, sunbury, in, september, 1799, william, cobbett, printed, extracts, from, this, handbill, asserting, that, dr, priestley, has, taken, great, pains, to, circulate, this, address, has, travelled, through, the, country, for, the, purpose, and, is, in, fact, the, patron, of, it, he, challenged, priestley, to, clear, himself, of, the, accusation, or, face, prosecution, barely, a, month, later, in, november, and, december, 1799, priestley, stepped, forward, in, his, own, defence, with, his, letters, to, the, inhabitants, of, northumberland, priestley, s, son, william, now, living, in, philadelphia, was, increasingly, embarrassed, by, his, father, s, actions, he, confronted, his, father, expressing, john, and, benjamin, vaughan, s, unease, his, own, wife, s, concerns, about, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, s, dietary, care, and, his, own, concerns, at, the, closeness, of, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, and, thomas, cooper, s, relationship, and, their, adverse, influence, on, dr, priestley, but, this, only, led, to, a, further, estrangement, between, william, and, his, sister, in, law, when, a, while, later, priestley, s, household, suffered, a, bout, of, food, poisoning, perhaps, from, milk, sickness, or, a, bacterial, infection, elizabeth, ryland, priestley, falsely, accused, william, of, having, poisoned, the, family, s, flour, although, this, allegation, has, attracted, the, attention, of, some, modern, historians, it, is, believed, to, be, without, foundation, priestley, continued, the, educational, projects, that, had, always, been, important, to, him, helping, to, establish, the, northumberland, academy, and, donating, his, library, to, the, fledgling, institution, he, exchanged, letters, regarding, the, proper, structure, of, a, university, with, thomas, jefferson, who, used, this, advice, when, founding, the, university, of, virginia, jefferson, and, priestley, became, close, and, when, the, latter, had, completed, his, general, history, of, the, christian, church, he, dedicated, it, to, president, jefferson, writing, that, it, is, now, only, that, i, can, say, i, see, nothing, to, fear, from, the, hand, of, power, the, government, under, which, i, live, being, for, the, first, time, truly, favourable, to, me, priestley, tried, to, continue, his, scientific, investigations, in, america, with, the, support, of, the, american, philosophical, society, to, which, he, had, been, previously, elected, a, member, in, 1785, he, was, hampered, by, lack, of, news, from, europe, unaware, of, the, latest, scientific, developments, priestley, was, no, longer, on, the, forefront, of, discovery, although, the, majority, of, his, publications, focused, on, defending, phlogiston, theory, he, also, did, some, original, work, on, spontaneous, generation, and, dreams, despite, priestley, s, reduced, scientific, output, his, presence, stimulated, american, interest, in, chemistry, by, 1801, priestley, had, become, so, ill, that, he, could, no, longer, write, or, experiment, he, died, on, the, morning, of, 6, february, 1804, aged, seventy, and, was, buried, at, riverview, cemetery, in, northumberland, pennsylvania, priestley, s, epitaph, reads, return, unto, thy, rest, o, my, soul, for, the, lord, hath, dealt, bountifully, with, thee, i, will, lay, me, down, in, peace, and, sleep, till, i, awake, in, the, morning, of, the, resurrection, by, the, time, he, died, in, 1804, priestley, had, been, made, a, member, of, every, major, scientific, society, in, the, western, world, and, he, had, discovered, numerous, substances, the, 19th, century, french, naturalist, george, cuvier, in, his, eulogy, of, priestley, praised, his, discoveries, while, at, the, same, time, lamenting, his, refusal, to, abandon, phlogiston, theory, calling, him, the, father, of, modern, chemistry, never, acknowledged, his, daughter, priestley, published, more, than, 150, works, on, topics, ranging, from, political, philosophy, to, education, to, theology, to, natural, philosophy, he, led, and, inspired, british, radicals, during, the, 1790s, paved, the, way, for, utilitarianism, and, helped, found, unitarianism, a, wide, variety, of, philosophers, scientists, and, poets, became, associationists, as, a, result, of, his, redaction, of, david, hartley, s, observations, on, man, including, erasmus, darwin, coleridge, william, wordsworth, john, stuart, mill, alexander, bain, and, herbert, spencer, immanuel, kant, praised, priestley, in, his, critique, of, pure, reason, 1781, writing, that, he, knew, how, to, combine, his, paradoxical, teaching, with, the, interests, of, religion, indeed, it, was, priestley, s, aim, to, put, the, most, advanced, enlightenment, ideas, into, the, service, of, a, rationalized, though, heterodox, christianity, under, the, guidance, of, the, basic, principles, of, scientific, method, considering, the, extent, of, priestley, s, influence, relatively, little, scholarship, has, been, devoted, to, him, in, the, early, 20th, century, priestley, was, most, often, described, as, a, conservative, and, dogmatic, scientist, who, was, nevertheless, a, political, and, religious, reformer, in, a, historiographic, review, essay, historian, of, science, simon, schaffer, describes, the, two, dominant, portraits, of, priestley, the, first, depicts, him, as, a, playful, innocent, who, stumbled, across, his, discoveries, the, second, portrays, him, as, innocent, as, well, as, warped, for, not, understanding, their, implications, better, assessing, priestley, s, works, as, a, whole, has, been, difficult, for, scholars, because, of, his, wide, ranging, interests, his, scientific, discoveries, have, usually, been, divorced, from, his, theological, and, metaphysical, publications, to, make, an, analysis, of, his, life, and, writings, easier, but, this, approach, has, been, challenged, recently, by, scholars, such, as, john, mcevoy, and, robert, schofield, although, early, priestley, scholarship, claimed, that, his, theological, and, metaphysical, works, were, distractions, and, obstacles, to, his, scientific, work, scholarship, published, in, the, 1960s, 1970s, and, 1980s, maintained, that, priestley, s, works, constituted, a, unified, theory, however, as, schaffer, explains, no, convincing, synthesis, of, his, work, has, yet, been, expounded, more, recently, in, 2001, historian, of, science, dan, eshet, has, argued, that, efforts, to, create, a, synoptic, view, have, resulted, only, in, a, rationalisation, of, the, contradictions, in, priestley, s, thought, because, they, have, been, organized, around, philosophical, categories, and, have, separate, the, producers, of, scientific, ideas, from, any, social, conflict, priestley, has, been, remembered, by, the, towns, in, which, he, served, as, a, reforming, educator, and, minister, and, by, the, scientific, organisations, he, influenced, two, educational, institutions, have, been, named, in, his, honour, priestley, college, in, warrington, and, joseph, priestley, college, in, leeds, now, part, of, leeds, city, college,
