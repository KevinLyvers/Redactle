to, use, you, in, a, very, intense, way, sometimes, it, is, not, pleasant, sometimes, it, is, fearful, but, nevertheless, it, is, inevitable, founded, in, 1926, the, same, year, as, graham, s, professional, dance, company, the, martha, graham, school, is, the, oldest, school, of, dance, in, the, united, states, first, located, in, a, small, studio, within, carnegie, hall, the, school, currently, has, two, different, studios, in, new, york, city, graham, was, born, in, allegheny, city, later, to, become, part, of, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, in, 1894, her, father, george, graham, practiced, as, what, in, the, victorian, era, was, known, as, an, alienist, a, practitioner, of, an, early, form, of, psychiatry, the, grahams, were, strict, presbyterians, her, father, was, a, third, generation, american, of, irish, descent, graham, s, mother, jane, beers, was, a, second, generation, american, of, irish, scots, irish, and, english, ancestry, and, who, claimed, to, be, a, tenth, generation, descendant, of, myles, standish, while, her, parents, provided, a, comfortable, environment, in, her, youth, it, was, not, one, that, encouraged, dancing, the, graham, family, moved, to, santa, barbara, california, when, martha, was, fourteen, years, old, in, 1911, she, attended, the, first, dance, performance, of, her, life, watching, ruth, st, denis, perform, at, the, mason, opera, house, in, los, angeles, in, the, mid, 1910s, martha, graham, began, her, studies, at, the, newly, created, denishawn, school, of, dancing, and, related, arts, founded, by, ruth, st, denis, and, ted, shawn, at, which, she, would, stay, until, 1923, in, 1922, graham, performed, one, of, shawn, s, egyptian, dances, with, lillian, powell, in, a, short, silent, film, by, hugo, riesenfeld, that, attempted, to, synchronize, a, dance, routine, on, film, with, a, live, orchestra, and, an, onscreen, conductor, graham, left, the, denishawn, establishment, in, 1923, in, order, to, become, a, featured, dancer, in, the, greenwich, village, follies, revue, for, two, years, as, a, result, she, felt, a, strong, urge, to, make, dance, an, art, form, that, was, more, grounded, in, the, rawness, of, the, human, experience, and, orientalism, as, opposed, to, just, a, mere, form, of, entertainment, this, motivated, graham, to, strip, away, the, more, decorative, movements, of, ballet, and, of, her, training, at, the, denishawn, school, and, focus, more, on, the, foundational, aspects, of, movement, in, 1925, graham, was, employed, at, the, eastman, school, of, music, where, rouben, mamoulian, was, head, of, the, school, of, drama, among, other, performances, together, mamoulian, and, graham, produced, a, short, two, color, film, called, the, flute, of, krishna, featuring, eastman, students, mamoulian, left, eastman, shortly, thereafter, and, graham, chose, to, leave, also, even, though, she, was, asked, to, stay, on, in, 1926, the, martha, graham, center, of, contemporary, dance, was, established, in, a, small, studio, on, the, upper, east, side, of, new, york, city, on, april, 18, of, the, same, year, graham, debuted, her, first, independent, concert, consisting, of, 18, short, solos, and, trios, that, she, had, choreographed, this, performance, took, place, at, the, 48th, street, theatre, in, manhattan, she, would, later, say, of, the, concert, everything, i, did, was, influenced, by, denishawn, on, november, 28, 1926, graham, and, others, in, her, company, gave, a, dance, recital, at, the, klaw, theatre, in, new, york, city, around, the, same, time, she, entered, an, extended, collaboration, with, japanese, american, pictorialist, photographer, soichi, sunami, and, over, the, next, five, years, they, together, created, some, of, the, most, iconic, images, of, early, modern, dance, graham, was, on, the, faculty, of, neighborhood, playhouse, school, of, the, theatre, when, it, opened, in, 1928, one, of, graham, s, students, was, heiress, bethsab, e, de, rothschild, with, whom, she, became, close, friends, when, rothschild, moved, to, israel, and, established, the, batsheva, dance, company, in, 1965, graham, became, the, company, s, first, director, graham, s, technique, pioneered, a, principle, known, as, contraction, and, release, in, modern, dance, which, was, derived, from, a, stylized, conception, of, breathing, contraction, and, release, the, desire, to, highlight, a, more, base, aspect, of, human, movement, led, graham, to, create, the, contraction, and, release, for, which, she, would, become, known, each, movement, could, separately, be, used, to, express, either, positive, or, negative, freeing, or, constricting, emotions, depending, on, the, placement, of, the, head, the, contraction, and, release, were, both, the, basis, for, graham, s, weighted, and, grounded, style, which, is, in, direct, opposition, to, classical, ballet, techniques, that, typically, aim, to, create, an, illusion, of, weightlessness, to, counter, the, more, percussive, and, staccato, movements, graham, eventually, added, the, spiral, shape, to, the, vocabulary, of, her, technique, to, incorporate, a, sense, of, fluidity, following, her, first, concert, made, up, of, solos, graham, created, heretic, 1929, the, first, group, piece, of, many, that, showcased, a, clear, diversion, from, her, days, with, denishawn, and, served, as, an, insight, to, her, work, that, would, follow, in, the, future, made, up, of, constricted, and, sharp, movement, with, the, dancers, clothed, unglamorously, the, piece, centered, on, the, theme, of, rejection, one, that, would, reoccur, in, other, graham, works, down, the, line, as, time, went, on, graham, moved, away, from, the, more, stark, design, aesthetic, she, initially, embraced, and, began, incorporating, more, elaborate, sets, and, scenery, to, her, work, to, do, this, she, collaborated, often, with, isamu, noguchi, a, japanese, american, designer, whose, eye, for, set, design, was, complementary, to, graham, s, choreography, within, the, many, themes, which, graham, incorporated, into, her, work, there, were, two, that, she, seemed, to, adhere, to, the, most, americana, and, greek, mythology, one, of, graham, s, most, known, pieces, that, incorporates, the, american, life, theme, is, appalachian, spring, 1944, she, collaborated, with, the, composer, aaron, copland, who, won, a, pulitzer, prize, for, his, work, on, the, piece, and, noguchi, who, created, the, nonliteral, set, as, she, did, often, graham, placed, herself, in, her, own, piece, as, the, bride, of, a, newly, married, couple, whose, optimism, for, starting, a, new, life, together, is, countered, by, a, grounded, pioneer, woman, and, a, sermon, giving, revivalist, two, of, graham, s, pieces, cave, of, heart, 1946, and, night, journey, 1947, display, her, interest, in, not, only, greek, mythology, but, also, with, the, psyche, of, a, woman, as, both, pieces, retell, greek, myths, from, a, woman, s, point, of, view, in, 1936, graham, created, chronicle, which, brought, serious, issues, to, the, stage, in, a, dramatic, manner, influenced, by, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, the, great, depression, that, followed, and, the, spanish, civil, war, the, dance, focused, on, depression, and, isolation, reflected, in, the, dark, nature, of, both, the, set, and, costumes, the, same, year, in, conjunction, with, the, 1936, summer, olympic, games, in, berlin, the, german, government, wanted, to, include, dance, in, the, art, competitions, that, took, place, during, the, olympics, an, event, that, previously, included, architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and, literature, although, joseph, goebbels, reich, minister, of, propaganda, was, not, appreciative, of, the, modern, dance, art, form, and, changed, germany, s, dance, from, more, avant, garde, to, traditional, he, and, adolf, hitler, still, agreed, to, invite, graham, to, represent, the, united, states, however, the, united, states, was, not, represented, in, the, art, competitions, as, graham, refused, the, invitation, by, stating, i, would, find, it, impossible, to, dance, in, germany, at, the, present, time, so, many, artists, whom, i, respect, and, admire, have, been, persecuted, have, been, deprived, of, the, right, to, work, for, ridiculous, and, unsatisfactory, reasons, that, i, should, consider, it, impossible, to, identify, myself, by, accepting, the, invitation, with, the, regime, that, has, made, such, things, possible, in, addition, some, of, my, concert, group, would, not, be, welcomed, in, germany, goebbels, himself, wrote, her, a, letter, assuring, her, that, her, jewish, dancers, would, receive, complete, immunity, however, it, was, not, enough, for, graham, to, accept, such, an, invitation, stimulated, by, the, occurrences, of, the, 1936, olympic, games, and, the, propaganda, that, she, heard, through, the, radio, from, the, axis, powers, graham, created, american, document, in, 1938, the, dance, expressed, american, ideals, and, democracy, as, graham, realized, that, it, could, empower, men, and, inspire, them, to, fight, fascist, and, nazi, ideologies, american, document, ended, up, as, a, patriotic, statement, focusing, on, rights, and, injustices, of, the, time, representing, the, american, people, including, its, native, american, heritage, and, slavery, during, the, performance, excerpts, from, the, u, s, declaration, of, independence, lincoln, s, gettysburg, address, and, the, emancipation, proclamation, were, read, these, were, passages, that, highlighted, the, american, ideals, and, represented, what, made, the, american, people, american, for, graham, a, dance, needed, to, reveal, certain, national, characteristics, because, without, these, characteristics, the, dance, would, have, no, validity, no, roots, no, direct, relation, to, life, the, beginning, of, american, document, marks, modern, concepts, of, performance, art, joining, dance, theater, and, literature, and, clearly, defining, the, roles, of, the, spectator, and, the, actors, dancers, the, narrator, actor, starts, with, establishing, an, awareness, of, the, present, place, and, time, which, serves, not, only, as, a, bridge, between, past, and, present, but, also, between, individual, and, collective, particular, and, general, together, with, her, unique, technique, this, sociological, and, philosophical, innovation, sets, dance, as, a, clear, expression, of, current, ideas, and, places, and, graham, as, a, pillar, of, the, modern, dance, revolution, 1938, became, a, big, year, for, graham, the, roosevelts, invited, graham, to, dance, at, the, white, house, making, her, the, first, dancer, to, perform, there, also, in, 1938, erick, hawkins, became, the, first, man, to, dance, with, her, company, he, officially, joined, her, troupe, the, following, year, dancing, male, lead, in, a, number, of, graham, s, works, they, were, married, in, july, 1948, after, the, new, york, premiere, of, night, journey, he, left, her, troupe, in, 1951, and, they, divorced, in, 1954, on, april, 1, 1958, the, martha, graham, dance, company, premiered, the, ballet, clytemnestra, based, on, the, ancient, greek, legend, clytemnestra, and, it, became, a, huge, success, and, great, accomplishment, for, graham, with, a, score, by, egyptian, born, composer, halim, el, dabh, this, ballet, was, a, large, scale, work, and, the, only, full, length, work, in, graham, s, career, graham, choreographed, and, danced, the, title, role, spending, almost, the, entire, duration, of, the, performance, on, the, stage, the, ballet, was, based, on, the, greek, mythology, of, the, same, title, and, tells, the, story, of, queen, clytemnestra, who, is, married, to, king, agamemnon, agamemnon, sacrifices, their, daughter, iphigenia, on, a, pyre, as, an, offering, to, the, gods, to, assure, fair, winds, to, troy, where, the, trojan, war, rages, upon, agamemnon, s, return, after, 10, years, clytemnestra, kills, agamemnon, to, avenge, the, murder, of, iphigenia, clytemnestra, is, then, murdered, by, her, son, orestes, and, the, audience, experiences, clytemnestra, in, the, afterworld, this, ballet, was, deemed, a, masterpiece, of, 20th, century, american, modernism, and, was, so, successful, it, had, a, limited, engagement, showing, at, the, 54th, street, theatre, on, broadway, conducted, by, robert, irving, voice, parts, sung, by, rosalia, maresca, and, ronald, holgate, graham, collaborated, with, many, composers, including, aaron, copland, on, appalachian, spring, louis, horst, samuel, barber, william, schuman, carlos, surinach, norman, dello, joio, and, gian, carlo, menotti, graham, s, mother, died, in, santa, barbara, in, 1958, her, oldest, friend, and, musical, collaborator, louis, horst, died, in, 1964, she, said, of, horst, his, sympathy, and, understanding, but, primarily, his, faith, gave, me, a, landscape, to, move, in, without, it, i, should, certainly, have, been, lost, graham, resisted, requests, for, her, dances, to, be, recorded, because, she, believed, that, live, performances, should, only, exist, on, stage, as, they, are, experienced, there, were, a, few, notable, exceptions, for, example, in, addition, to, her, collaboration, with, sunami, in, the, 1920s, she, also, worked, on, a, limited, basis, with, still, photographers, imogen, cunningham, in, the, 1930s, and, barbara, morgan, in, the, 1940s, graham, considered, philippe, halsman, s, photographs, of, dark, meadow, the, most, complete, photographic, record, of, any, of, her, dances, halsman, also, photographed, in, the, 1940s, letter, to, the, world, cave, of, the, heart, night, journey, and, every, soul, is, a, circus, in, later, years, her, thinking, on, the, matter, evolved, and, others, convinced, her, to, let, them, recreate, some, of, what, was, lost, in, 1952, graham, allowed, taping, of, her, meeting, and, cultural, exchange, with, famed, deaf, blind, author, activist, and, lecturer, helen, keller, who, after, a, visit, to, one, of, graham, s, company, rehearsals, became, a, close, friend, and, supporter, graham, was, inspired, by, keller, s, joy, from, and, interpretation, of, dance, utilizing, her, body, to, feel, the, vibration, of, drums, and, of, feet, and, movement, moving, the, air, around, her, in, her, biography, martha, agnes, de, mille, cites, graham, s, last, performance, as, having, occurred, on, the, evening, of, may, 25, 1968, in, time, of, snow, but, in, a, dancer, s, life, biographer, russell, freedman, lists, the, year, of, graham, s, final, performance, as, 1969, in, her, 1991, autobiography, blood, memory, graham, herself, lists, her, final, performance, as, her, 1970, appearance, in, cortege, of, eagles, when, she, was, 76, years, old, graham, s, choreographies, span, 181, compositions, in, the, years, that, followed, her, departure, from, the, stage, graham, sank, into, a, deep, depression, fueled, by, views, from, the, wings, of, young, dancers, performing, many, of, the, dances, she, had, choreographed, for, herself, and, her, former, husband, graham, s, health, declined, precipitously, as, she, abused, alcohol, to, numb, her, pain, in, blood, memory, she, wrote, it, wasn, t, until, years, after, i, had, relinquished, a, ballet, that, i, could, bear, to, watch, someone, else, dance, it, i, believe, in, never, looking, back, never, indulging, in, nostalgia, or, reminiscing, yet, how, can, you, avoid, it, when, you, look, on, stage, and, see, a, dancer, made, up, to, look, as, you, did, thirty, years, ago, dancing, a, ballet, you, created, with, someone, you, were, then, deeply, in, love, with, your, husband, i, think, that, is, a, circle, of, hell, dante, omitted, i, had, lost, my, will, to, live, i, stayed, home, alone, ate, very, little, and, drank, too, much, and, brooded, my, face, was, ruined, and, people, say, i, looked, odd, which, i, agreed, with, finally, my, system, just, gave, in, i, was, in, the, hospital, for, a, long, time, much, of, it, in, a, coma, graham, not, only, survived, her, hospital, stay, but, she, rallied, in, 1972, she, quit, drinking, returned, to, her, studio, reorganized, her, company, and, went, on, to, choreograph, ten, new, ballets, and, many,

spread, over, the, sangre, de, cristo, mountains, in, northern, new, mexico, graham, has, been, sometimes, termed, the, picasso, of, dance, in, that, her, importance, and, influence, to, modern, dance, can, be, considered, equivalent, to, what, pablo, picasso, was, to, modern, visual, arts, her, impact, has, been, also, compared, to, the, influence, of, stravinsky, on, music, and, frank, lloyd, wright, on, architecture, in, 2013, the, dance, films, by, her, were, selected, for, preservation, in, the, national, film, registry, by, the, registry, s, owner, the, library, of, congress,

said, to, be, the, one, that, brought, dance, into, the, 20th, century, due, to, the, work, of, her, assistants, linda, hodes, pearl, lang, diane, gray, yuriko, and, others, much, of, graham, s, work, and, technique, have, been, preserved, they, taped, interviews, of, graham, describing, her, entire, technique, and, videos, of, her, performances, glen, tetley, told, agnes, de, mille, the, wonderful, thing, about, martha, in, her, good, days, was, her, generosity, so, many, people, stole, martha, s, unique, personal, vocabulary, consciously, or, unconsciously, and, performed, it, in, concerts, i, have, never, once, heard, martha, say, so, and, so, has, used, my, choreography, an, entire, movement, was, created, by, her, that, revolutionized, the, dance, world, and, created, what, is, known, today, as, modern, dance, now, dancers, all, over, the, world, study, and, perform, modern, dance, choreographers, and, professional, dancers, look, to, her, for, inspiration, agnes, de, mille, said, the, greatest, thing, ever, said, to, me, was, in, 1943, after, the, opening, of, oklahoma, when, i, suddenly, had, unexpected, flamboyant, success, for, a, work, i, thought, was, only, fairly, good, after, years, of, neglect, for, work, i, thought, was, fine, i, was, bewildered, and, worried, that, my, entire, scale, of, values, was, untrustworthy, i, talked, to, martha, i, remember, the, conversation, well, it, was, in, a, schrafft, s, restaurant, over, a, soda, i, confessed, that, i, had, a, burning, desire, to, be, excellent, but, no, faith, that, i, could, be, martha, said, to, me, very, quietly, there, is, a, vitality, a, life, force, an, energy, a, quickening, that, is, translated, through, you, into, action, and, because, there, is, only, one, of, you, in, all, of, time, this, expression, is, unique, and, if, you, block, it, it, will, never, exist, through, any, other, medium, and, it, will, be, lost, the, world, will, not, have, it, it, is, not, your, business, to, determine, how, good, it, is, nor, how, valuable, nor, how, it, compares, with, other, expressions, it, is, your, business, to, keep, it, yours, clearly, and, directly, to, keep, the, channel, open, you, do, not, even, have, to, believe, in, yourself, or, your, work, you, have, to, keep, yourself, open, and, aware, to, the, urges, that, motivate, you, keep, the, channel, open, no, artist, is, pleased, no, satisfaction, whatever, at, any, time, there, is, only, a, queer, divine, dissatisfaction, a, blessed, unrest, that, keeps, us, marching, and, makes, us, more, alive,
