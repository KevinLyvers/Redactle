muhammad, ibn, muhammad, ibn, al, hasan, al, tusi, 1201, 1274, also, known, as, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, arabic, persian, or, simply, as, al, tusi, was, a, persian, polymath, architect, philosopher, physician, scientist, and, theologian, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, was, a, well, published, author, writing, on, subjects, of, math, engineering, prose, and, mysticism, additionally, al, tusi, made, several, scientific, advancements, in, astronomy, al, tusi, created, very, accurate, tables, of, planetary, motion, an, updated, planetary, model, and, critiques, of, ptolemaic, astronomy, he, also, made, strides, in, logic, mathematics, but, especially, trigonometry, biology, and, chemistry, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, left, behind, a, great, legacy, as, well, tusi, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, scientists, of, medieval, islam, since, he, is, often, considered, the, creator, of, trigonometry, as, a, mathematical, discipline, in, its, own, right, the, muslim, scholar, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, considered, tusi, to, be, the, greatest, of, the, later, persian, scholars, there, is, also, reason, to, believe, that, he, may, have, influenced, copernican, heliocentrism, nasir, al, din, tusi, was, born, in, the, city, of, tus, in, medieval, khorasan, northeastern, iran, in, the, year, 1201, and, began, his, studies, at, an, early, age, in, hamadan, and, tus, he, studied, the, quran, hadith, ja, fari, jurisprudence, logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and, astronomy, he, was, born, into, a, sh, ah, family, and, lost, his, father, at, a, young, age, fulfilling, the, wish, of, his, father, the, young, muhammad, took, learning, and, scholarship, very, seriously, and, traveled, far, and, wide, to, attend, the, lectures, of, renowned, scholars, and, acquired, knowledge, an, exercise, highly, encouraged, in, his, islamic, faith, at, a, young, age, he, moved, to, nishapur, to, study, philosophy, under, farid, al, din, damad, and, mathematics, under, muhammad, hasib, he, met, also, attar, of, nishapur, the, legendary, sufi, master, who, was, later, killed, by, the, mongols, and, he, attended, the, lectures, of, qutb, al, din, al, misri, a, student, of, al, razi, nasir, al, din, tusi, writes, in, his, work, desideratum, of, the, faithful, ma, l, b, al, mu, min, n, to, become, people, of, spiritual, reality, it, is, incumbent, to, fulfill, the, symbolic, elucidation, ta, w, l, of, the, seven, pillars, of, the, religious, law, shar, at, he, also, explains, that, fulfilling, the, religious, law, is, much, easier, than, fulfilling, its, spiritual, interpretation, he, explains, in, his, book, aghaz, u, anjam, that, the, sacred, accounts, of, history, that, we, perceive, within, the, bounds, of, space, and, time, symbolize, events, that, have, no, such, restrictions, they, are, only, expressed, in, this, way, so, that, humans, are, able, to, comprehend, them, in, mosul, al, tusi, studied, mathematics, and, astronomy, with, kamal, al, din, yunus, d, ah, 639, ad, 1242, a, pupil, of, sharaf, al, d, n, al, s, later, on, he, corresponded, with, sadr, al, din, al, qunawi, the, son, in, law, of, ibn, arabi, and, it, seems, that, mysticism, as, propagated, by, sufi, masters, of, his, time, was, not, appealing, to, him, once, the, occasion, was, suitable, he, composed, his, own, manual, of, philosophical, sufism, in, the, form, of, a, small, booklet, entitled, awsaf, al, ashraf, or, the, attributes, of, the, illustrious, as, the, armies, of, genghis, khan, swept, his, homeland, he, was, employed, by, the, nizari, ismaili, state, and, while, moving, from, stronghold, to, stronghold, made, his, most, important, contributions, in, science, first, in, those, of, the, quhistan, region, under, muhtasham, nasir, al, din, abd, al, rahim, ibn, abi, mansur, where, he, wrote, the, nasirean, ethics, he, was, later, sent, to, the, major, castles, of, alamut, and, maymun, diz, to, continue, his, career, under, nizari, imam, ala, al, din, muhammad, he, was, captured, after, the, fall, of, maymun, diz, to, the, mongol, forces, under, hulagu, khan, nasir, al, din, tusi, s, autobiography, the, voyage, sayr, wa, suluk, explains, that, a, literary, devastation, such, as, the, devastation, of, the, alam, t, libraries, in, 1256, would, not, waver, the, spirit, of, the, nizari, ismaili, community, because, they, give, more, importance, to, the, living, book, the, imam, of, the, time, rather, than, the, written, word, their, hearts, are, attached, to, the, commander, of, the, believers, amir, al, mu, minin, not, just, the, command, itself, there, is, always, a, present, living, imam, in, world, and, following, him, a, believer, will, never, go, astray, in, 1256, al, tusi, was, in, the, castle, of, alamut, when, it, was, attacked, by, the, forces, of, the, mongol, leader, hulegu, a, grandson, of, genghis, khan, some, sources, claim, that, al, tusi, betrayed, the, defences, of, alamut, to, the, invading, mongols, after, his, forces, destroyed, alamut, hulegu, who, was, himself, interested, in, the, natural, sciences, treated, al, tusi, with, great, respect, appointing, him, as, scientific, adviser, and, a, permanent, member, of, his, inner, council, to, great, controversy, it, is, widely, assumed, tusi, was, with, the, mongol, forces, under, hulegu, when, they, attacked, and, massacred, the, inhabitants, of, baghdad, in, 1258, and, he, played, an, essential, role, in, ending, of, the, quraysh, empire, soon, after, he, was, given, the, full, authority, of, administering, the, finances, of, religious, foundations, and, visited, many, of, the, shi, a, shrines, once, the, siege, of, baghdad, was, over, being, in, a, position, of, power, tusi, was, able, to, bolster, the, twelver, shi, a, cause, throughout, persia, and, iraq, tusi, has, about, 150, works, of, which, 25, are, in, persian, and, the, remaining, are, in, arabic, and, there, is, one, treatise, in, persian, arabic, and, turkish, an, example, from, one, of, his, poems, anyone, who, knows, and, knows, that, he, knows, makes, the, steed, of, intelligence, leap, over, the, vault, of, heaven, anyone, who, does, not, know, but, knows, that, he, does, not, know, can, bring, his, lame, little, donkey, to, the, destination, nonetheless, anyone, who, does, not, know, and, does, not, know, that, he, does, not, know, is, stuck, forever, in, double, ignorance, during, his, stay, in, nishapur, tusi, established, a, reputation, as, an, exceptional, scholar, tusi, s, prose, writing, which, numbers, over, 150, works, represent, one, of, the, largest, collections, by, a, single, islamic, author, writing, in, both, arabic, and, persian, nasir, al, din, tusi, dealt, with, both, religious, islamic, topics, and, non, religious, or, secular, subjects, the, ancient, sciences, his, works, include, the, definitive, arabic, versions, of, the, works, of, euclid, archimedes, ptolemy, autolycus, and, theodosius, of, bithynia, tusi, convinced, hulegu, khan, to, construct, an, observatory, for, establishing, accurate, astronomical, tables, for, better, astrological, predictions, beginning, in, 1259, the, rasad, khaneh, observatory, was, constructed, in, azarbaijan, south, of, the, river, aras, and, to, the, west, of, maragheh, the, capital, of, the, ilkhanate, empire, based, on, the, observations, in, this, for, the, time, being, most, advanced, observatory, tusi, made, very, accurate, tables, of, planetary, movements, as, depicted, in, his, book, zij, i, ilkhani, ilkhanic, tables, this, book, contains, astronomical, tables, for, calculating, the, positions, of, the, planets, and, the, names, of, the, stars, his, model, for, the, planetary, system, is, believed, to, be, the, most, advanced, of, his, time, and, was, used, extensively, until, the, development, of, the, heliocentric, model, in, the, time, of, nicolaus, copernicus, between, ptolemy, and, copernicus, he, is, considered, by, many, to, be, one, of, the, most, eminent, astronomers, of, his, time, his, famous, student, shams, al, din, al, bukhari, was, the, teacher, of, byzantine, scholar, gregory, chioniades, who, had, in, turn, trained, astronomer, manuel, bryennios, about, 1300, in, constantinople, for, his, planetary, models, he, invented, a, geometrical, technique, called, a, tusi, couple, which, generates, linear, motion, from, the, sum, of, two, circular, motions, he, used, this, technique, to, replace, ptolemy, s, problematic, equant, for, many, planets, but, was, unable, to, find, a, solution, to, mercury, which, was, used, later, by, ibn, al, shatir, as, well, as, ali, qushji, the, tusi, couple, was, later, employed, in, ibn, al, shatir, s, geocentric, model, and, nicolaus, copernicus, heliocentric, copernican, model, he, also, calculated, the, value, for, the, annual, precession, of, the, equinoxes, and, contributed, to, the, construction, and, usage, of, some, astronomical, instruments, including, the, astrolabe, s, criticized, ptolemy, s, use, of, observational, evidence, to, show, that, the, earth, was, at, rest, noting, that, such, proofs, were, not, decisive, although, it, doesn, t, mean, that, he, was, a, supporter, of, mobility, of, the, earth, as, he, and, his, 16th, century, commentator, al, b, rjand, maintained, that, the, earth, s, immobility, could, be, demonstrated, only, by, physical, principles, found, in, natural, philosophy, tusi, s, criticisms, of, ptolemy, were, similar, to, the, arguments, later, used, by, copernicus, in, 1543, to, defend, the, earth, s, rotation, about, the, real, essence, of, the, milky, way, s, in, his, tadhkira, writes, the, milky, way, i, e, the, galaxy, is, made, up, of, a, very, large, number, of, small, tightly, clustered, stars, which, on, account, of, their, concentration, and, smallness, seem, to, be, cloudy, patches, because, of, this, it, was, likened, to, milk, in, color, three, centuries, later, the, proof, of, the, milky, way, consisting, of, many, stars, came, in, 1610, when, galileo, galilei, used, a, telescope, to, study, the, milky, way, and, discovered, that, it, is, really, composed, of, a, huge, number, of, faint, stars, nasir, al, din, tusi, was, a, supporter, of, avicennian, logic, and, wrote, the, following, commentary, on, avicenna, s, theory, of, absolute, propositions, what, spurred, him, to, this, was, that, in, the, assertoric, syllogistic, aristotle, and, others, sometimes, used, contradictories, of, absolute, propositions, on, the, assumption, that, they, are, absolute, and, that, was, why, so, many, decided, that, absolutes, did, contradict, absolutes, when, avicenna, had, shown, this, to, be, wrong, he, wanted, to, develop, a, method, of, construing, those, examples, from, aristotle, al, tusi, was, the, first, to, write, a, work, on, trigonometry, independently, of, astronomy, al, tusi, in, his, treatise, on, the, quadrilateral, gave, an, extensive, exposition, of, spherical, trigonometry, distinct, from, astronomy, it, was, in, the, works, of, al, tusi, that, trigonometry, achieved, the, status, of, an, independent, branch, of, pure, mathematics, distinct, from, astronomy, to, which, it, had, been, linked, for, so, long, he, was, the, first, to, list, the, six, distinct, cases, of, a, right, triangle, in, spherical, trigonometry, this, followed, earlier, work, by, greek, mathematicians, such, as, menelaus, of, alexandria, who, wrote, a, book, on, spherical, trigonometry, called, sphaerica, and, the, earlier, muslim, mathematicians, ab, al, waf, al, b, zj, n, and, al, jayyani, in, his, on, the, sector, figure, appears, the, famous, sine, law, for, plane, triangles, he, also, stated, the, sine, law, for, spherical, triangles, discovered, the, law, of, tangents, for, spherical, triangles, and, provided, proofs, for, these, laws, while, aristotle, d, 322, bce, had, suggested, that, all, colors, can, be, aligned, on, a, single, line, from, black, to, white, ibn, sina, d, 1037, described, that, there, were, three, paths, from, black, to, white, one, path, via, grey, a, second, path, via, red, and, the, third, path, via, green, al, tusi, ca, 1258, stated, that, there, are, no, less, than, five, of, such, paths, via, lemon, yellow, blood, red, pistachio, green, indigo, blue, and, grey, this, text, which, was, copied, in, the, middle, east, numerous, times, until, at, least, the, nineteenth, century, as, part, of, the, textbook, revision, of, the, optics, tanqih, al, manazir, by, kamal, al, din, al, farisi, d, 1320, made, color, space, effectively, two, dimensional, before, al, tusi, robert, grosseteste, d, 1253, had, proposed, an, effectively, three, dimensional, model, of, color, space, in, his, akhlaq, i, nasiri, tusi, wrote, about, several, biological, topics, he, defended, a, version, of, aristotle, s, scala, naturae, in, which, he, placed, man, above, animals, plants, minerals, and, the, elements, he, described, grasses, which, grow, without, sowing, or, cultivation, by, the, mere, mingling, of, elements, as, closest, to, minerals, among, plants, he, considered, the, date, palm, as, the, most, highly, developed, since, it, only, lacks, one, thing, further, to, reach, the, stage, of, an, animal, to, tear, itself, loose, from, the, soil, and, to, move, away, in, the, quest, for, nourishment, the, lowest, animals, are, adjacent, to, the, region, of, plants, such, are, those, animals, which, propagate, like, grass, being, incapable, of, mating, e, g, earthworms, and, certain, insects, the, animals, which, reach, the, stage, of, perfection, are, distinguished, by, fully, developed, weapons, such, as, antlers, horns, teeth, and, claws, tusi, described, these, organs, as, adaptations, to, each, species, s, lifestyle, in, a, way, anticipating, natural, theology, he, continued, the, noblest, of, the, species, is, that, one, whose, sagacity, and, perception, is, such, that, it, accepts, discipline, and, instruction, thus, there, accrues, to, it, the, perfection, not, originally, created, in, it, such, are, the, schooled, horse, and, the, trained, falcon, the, greater, this, faculty, grows, in, it, the, more, surpassing, its, rank, until, a, point, is, reached, where, the, mere, observation, of, action, suffices, as, instruction, thus, when, they, see, a, thing, they, perform, the, like, of, it, by, mimicry, without, training, this, is, the, utmost, of, the, animal, degrees, and, the, first, of, the, degrees, of, man, in, contiguous, therewith, thus, in, this, paragraph, tusi, described, different, types, of, learning, recognising, observational, learning, as, the, most, advanced, form, and, correctly, attributing, it, to, certain, animals, tusi, seems, to, have, perceived, man, as, belonging, to, the, animals, since, he, stated, that, the, animal, soul, is, restricted, to, individuals, of, the, animal, species, and, that, by, possessing, a, human, soul, mankind, is, distinguished, and, particularized, among, other, animals, some, scholars, have, interpreted, tusi, s, biological, writings, as, suggesting, that, he, adhered, to, some, kind, of, evolutionary, theory, however, tusi, did, not, state, explicitly, that, he, believed, species, to, change, over, time, tusi, contributed, to, the, field, of, chemistry, stating, an, early, law, of, conservation, of, mass, al, tusi, s, theory, of, chemical, transformation, was, based, on, the, idea, that, substances, could, be, transformed, into, other, substances, through, chemical, reactions, but, that, the, total, mass, of, the, substances, involved, in, the, reaction, would, remain, constant, this, idea, was, a, precursor, to, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, which, states, that, the, total, mass, of, a, closed, system, remains, constant, during, a, chemical, reaction, al, tusi, believed, that, chemical, transformations, were, governed, by, natural, laws, and, that, they, could, be, understood, through, observation, experimentation, and, logical, reasoning, tusi, contributed, many, writings, to, the, topic, of, philosophy, amongst, his, philosophical, work, are, his, disagreements, with, fellow, philosopher, avicenna, his, most, famous, philosophical, work, is, akhlaq, i, nasiri, or, nasirean, ethics, in, english, within, this, work, he, discusses, and, compares, islamic, teachings, to, the, ethics, of, aristotle, and, plato, tusi, s, book, became, a, popular, ethical, work, in, the, muslim, world, specifically, in, india, and, persia, tusi, s, work, also, left, an, impact, on, shi, ite, islamic, theology, his, book, targid, also, called, catharsis, is, significant, in, shi, ite, theology, he, also, contributed, five, works, to, the, subject, of, logic, which, were, highly, regarded, by, his, contemporaries, and, achieved, notoriety, in, the, muslim, world, a, 60, km, diameter, lunar, crater, located, on, the, southern, hemisphere, of, the, moon, is, named, after, him, as, nasireddin, a, minor, planet, 10269, tusi, discovered, by, soviet, astronomer, nikolai, stepanovich, chernykh, in, 1979, is, named, after, him, the, k, n, toosi, university, of, technology, in, iran, and, observatory, of, shamakhy, in, the, republic, of, azerbaijan, are, also, named, after, him, in, february, 2013, google, celebrated, his, 812th, birthday, with, a, doodle, which, was, accessible, in, its, websites, with, arabic, language, calling, him, al, farsi, the, persian, his, birthday, is, also, celebrated, as, engineer, s, day, in, iran, some, scholars, believe, that, nicolaus, copernicus, may, have, been, influenced, by, middle, eastern, astronomers, due, to, uncanny, similarities, between, his, work, and, the, uncited, work, of, these, islamic, scholars, including, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, ibn, al, shatir, muayyad, al, din, al, urdi, and, qutb, al, din, al, shirazi, al, tusi, specifically, the, plagiarism, in, question, comes, from, similarities, in, the, tusi, couple, and, copernicus, geometric, method, of, removing, the, equant, from, mathematical, astronomy, not, only, do, both, of, the, methods, match, geometrically, however, more, importantly, they, both, use, the, same, exact, lettering, system, for, each, vertex, a, detail, that, seems, too, preternatural, to, be, happenstance, moreover, the, fact, that, several, other, details, of, his, model, also, mirror, other, islamic, scholars, bolsters, the, notion, that, copernicus, work, may, not, have, been, only, his, own, there, is, no, evidence, that, any, of, the, direct, work, of, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, ever, made, it, to, copernicus, however, there, is, evidence, that, the, mathematics, and, theories, did, make, the, journey, to, europe, there, were, jewish, scientists, and, pilgrims, who, would, make, the, journey, from, the, middle, east, to, europe, bringing, with, them, middle, eastern, scientific, ideas, to, share, with, their, christian, counterparts, while, acknowledging, that, this, is, not, direct, evidence, that, copernicus, has, access, to, al, tusi, s, work, it, does, show, that, it, was, possible, there, was, just, such, a, jewish, scholar, by, the, name, of, abner, of, burgos, who, wrote, a, book, containing, an, incomplete, version, of, the, tusi, couple, that, he, had, learned, second, hand, which, could, have, been, found, by, copernicus, it, is, important, to, note, that, his, version, had, no, proofs, of, the, geometry, either, so, if, copernicus, had, obtained, this, book, he, would, have, had, to, complete, both, the, proof, and, mechanism, additionally, some, scholars, believe, that, if, not, jewish, thinkers, it, could, have, been, transmission, from, the, islamic, school, in, maragheh, home, to, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, s, observatory, to, muslim, spain, from, spain, al, tusi, and, other, islamic, cosmological, theories, could, spread, through, europe, spread, of, islamic, astronomy, from, maragheh, observatory, into, europe, could, have, also, been, possible, in, the, form, of, greek, translations, from, gregory, choniades, there, is, evidence, as, to, the, means, of, copernicus, acquiring, the, tusi, couple, and, suspicious, similarities, not, only, in, math, but, in, visual, details, as, well, despite, this, circumstantial, evidence, there, is, still, no, direct, proof, that, copernicus, did, plagiarize, the, work, of, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, and, if, he, did, that, he, did, so, intentionally, the, tusi, couple, is, not, a, unique, principle, and, as, the, equant, was, a, problematic, necessity, to, preserve, circular, motion, it, is, possible, that, more, than, one, astronomer, wished, to, improve, on, it, to, that, end, some, scholars, argue, it, would, not, be, difficult, for, an, astronomer, to, use, euclid, s, own, work, to, derive, the, tusi, couple, on, their, own, and, that, copernicus, most, likely, did, this, instead, of, stealing, before, copernicus, ever, published, the, work, on, his, geometrical, mechanism, he, had, written, at, length, his, dissatisfaction, over, ptolemaic, astronomy, and, the, use, of, the, equant, so, some, scholars, then, purport, that, it, was, not, unfounded, for, copernicus, to, have, rederived, the, tusi, couple, without, having, seen, it, as, he, had, clear, motive, to, do, so, also, some, scholars, that, argue, copernicus, did, commit, plagiarism, say, that, by, never, claiming, it, as, his, own, he, inherently, condemns, himself, however, others, critique, that, mathematicians, do, not, normally, claim, work, like, other, scientists, so, declaring, a, theorem, for, oneself, is, an, exception, and, not, the, norm, therefore, there, is, motive, and, some, explanation, as, to, why, and, how, copernicus, did, not, plagiarize, despite, the, evidence, against, him
