worked, at, a, bank, although, she, loved, ballet, she, wished, for, her, son, to, join, the, military, this, was, a, difficult, topic, to, enforce, in, the, family, because, not, only, was, the, mother, artistic, george, s, father, was, also, very, talented, at, playing, the, piano, many, believe, that, because, his, father, was, very, invested, in, the, arts, balanchine, s, career, of,

attending, ballet, here, could, have, been, viewed, as, a, convenience, to, the, balanchivadze, family, because, this, is, where, his, father, composed, music, this, theater, was, transferred, to, the, people, s, enlightenment, commissariat, and, became, property, of, the, state, the, theater, reopened, in, 1918, then, two, years, later, the, theater, was, called, the, state, academic, theater,

directors, did, not, approve, of, or, like, george, balanchine, went, about, his, choreography, in, an, experimental, way, during, the, evening, time, he, and, his, colleagues, eventually, performed, this, piece, at, the, state, school, of, ballet, this, was, followed, by, another, duet, enigma, with, the, dancers, in, bare, feet, rather, than, ballet, shoes, while, teaching, at, the, mariinsky, ballet, he, met, tamara, geva, his, future, wife, in, 1923, with, geva, and, fellow, dancers, balanchine, formed, a, small, ensemble, the, young, ballet, in, 1924, the, young, ballet, managed, to,

later, that, in, that, time, they, had, to, dance, in, small, dark, places, in, summer, theaters, and, private, ballrooms, in, beer, gardens, and, before, mental, patients, they, could, barely, afford, paying, for, hotels, and, often, had, only, tea, for, meal, in, london, they, had, two, weeks, of, very, unsuccessful, performances, when, the, audience, met, them, with, dead, silence, with, expiring, visas, they, were, not, welcome, in, any, other, european, country, they, moved, to, paris, where, there, was, a, large, russian, community, at, this, time, the, impresario, sergei,

company, sergei, diaghilev, insisted, that, balanchine, change, his, name, from, balanchivadze, to, balanchine, diaghilev, soon, promoted, balanchine, to, ballet, master, of, the, company, and, encouraged, his, choreography, between, 1924, and, diaghilev, s, death, in, 1929, balanchine, created, ten, ballets, as, well, as, lesser, works, during, these, years, he, worked, with, composers,

creating, new, works, that, combined, all, the, arts, among, his, new, works, during, 1928, in, paris, balanchine, premiered, apollon, musag, te, apollo, and, the, muses, in, a, collaboration, with, stravinsky, it, was, one, of, his, most, innovative, ballets, combining, classical, ballet, and, classical, greek, myth, and, images, with, jazz, movement, he, described, it, as, the, turning, point, in, my, life, apollo, is, regarded, as, the, original, neoclassical, ballet, apollo, brought, the, male, dancer, to, the, forefront, giving, him, two, solos, within, the, ballet, apollo, is, known, for, its, minimalism, using, simple, costumes, and, sets, this, allowed, the, audience, not, to, be, distracted, from, the, movement, balanchine, considered, music, to, be, the, primary, influence, on, choreography, as, opposed, to, the, narrative, due, to, a, serious, knee, injury, balanchine, had, to, limit, his, dancing, effectively, ending, his, performance, career, so, he, decided, to, focus, all, his, attention, on, choreography, after, diaghilev, s, death, the, ballets, russes, went, bankrupt, to, earn, money, balanchine, began, to, stage, dances, for, charles, b, cochran, s,

choreographers, featured, dancers, included, david, lichine, and, tatiana, riabouchinska, in, 1933, without, consulting, blum, col, de, basil, dropped, balanchine, after, one, year, ostensibly, because, he, thought, that, audiences, preferred, the, works, choreographed, by, massine, librettist, boris, kochno, was, also, let, go, while, dancer, tamara, toumanova, a, strong, admirer, of, balanchine, left, the, company, when, balanchine, was, fired, balanchine, and, kochno, immediately, founded, les, ballets, 1933, with, kochno, diaghilev, s, former, secretary, and, companion, serving,

milhaud, henri, sauguet, and, designer, pavel, tchelitchew, balanchine, insisted, that, his, first, project, in, the, united, states, would, be, to, establish, a, ballet, school, because, he, wanted, to, develop, dancers, who, had, strong, technique, along, with, his, particular, style, compared, to, his, classical, training, he, thought, they, could, not, dance, well, with, the, assistance, of,

slaughter, on, tenth, avenue, in, which, a, tap, dancer, falls, in, love, with, a, dance, hall, girl, balanchine, s, choreography, in, musicals, was, unique, at, the, time, because, it, furthered, the, plot, of, the, story, balanchine, relocated, his, company, to, hollywood, in, 1938, where, he, rented, a, white, two, story, house, with, kolya, nicholas, kopeikine, his, rehearsal, pianist, and,
