on, for, his, own, purposes, torquemada, subdued, ferdinand, s, own, ambitions, and, became, his, confessor, also, torquemada, deeply, suspected, the, marrano, and, morisco, as, a, menace, to, spain, s, welfare, by, both, their, increasing, religious, influence, and, their, economic, power, in, spain, the, crown, of, aragon, had, dominican, inquisitors, almost, continuously, throughout, much, of,

the, pope, granted, their, request, and, established, the, holy, office, for, the, propagation, of, the, faith, in, late, 1478, the, papal, bull, gave, the, sovereigns, full, powers, to, name, inquisitors, rome, retained, the, right, to, formally, appoint, the, royal, nominees, henry, charles, lea, observed, that, the, spanish, inquisition, in, both, castile, and, aragon, remained, firmly, under, ferdinand, s, direction, throughout, the, joint, reign, the, pope, went, on, to, appoint, a, number, of, inquisitors, for, the, spanish, kingdoms, in, early, 1482, including, torquemada, a, year, later, he, was, named, grand, inquisitor, of, spain, which, he, remained, until, his, death, in, 1498, in, 1484, torquemada, relinquished, his, role, as, royal, confessor, to, diego, deza, a, dominican, who, would, eventually, succeed, him, as, grand, inquisitor, the, following, year, at, a, general, assembly, in, seville, torquemada, promulgated, the, twenty, eight, articles, of, faith, that, would, be, used, to, guide, the, inquisitors, investigations, in, the, fifteen, years, under, his, direction, the, spanish, inquisition, grew, from, a, single, tribunal, at, seville, to, a, network, of, two, dozen, holy, offices, as, grand, inquisitor, torquemada, reorganized, the, spanish, inquisition, originally, based, in, castile, in, 1478, establishing, tribunals, in, sevilla, ja, n, c, rdoba, ciudad, real, and, later, saragossa, his, quest, was, to, rid, spain, of, heresy, the, spanish, chronicler, sebasti, n, de, olmedo, called, him, the, hammer, of, heretics, the, light, of, spain, the, savior, of, his, country, the, honor, of, his, order, under, the, alhambra, decree, of, march, 31, 1492, approximately, 40, 000, jews, were, expelled, from, spain, with, only, their, personal, possessions, approximately, 50, 000, other, jews, received, christian, baptism, to, remain, in, spain, many, of, them, derogatorily, dubbed, marranos, by, the, old, christian, majority, secretly, kept, some, of, their, jewish, traditions, they, were, among, the, chief, targets, of, the, inquisition, but, it, also, pursued, anyone, who, criticized, it, so, many, clemency, petitions, were, sent, to, rome, that, the, pope, became, aware, of, torquemada, s, severity, and, he, called, the, inquisition, s, representatives, to, rome, three, times, in, addition, isabella, and, ferdinand, were, so, concerned, at, the, quantity, of, money, that, was, being, diverted, to, the, holy, office, that, they, too, protested, to, the, pope, but, torquemada, s, power, kept, him, in, his, position, until, at, least, 1494, there, are, various, estimates, of, the, number, of, victims, of, the, spanish, inquisition, during, torquemada, s, reign, as, grand, inquisitor, hernando, del, pulgar, queen, isabella, s, secretary, wrote, that, 2, 000, executions, took, place, throughout, the, entirety, of, her, reign, which, extended, well, beyond, torquemada, s, death, during, his, final, years, torquemada, s, failing, health, caused, pope, alexander, vi, to, appoint, four, assistant, inquisitors, in, june, 1494, to, assist, torquemada, with, the, administration, of, the, inquisition, while, officially, this, papal, appointment, of, assistants, appeared, to, be, due, to, torquemada, s, failing, health, many, historians, believe, that, the, numerous, complaints, reaching, the, pope, about, torquemada, s, relentless, zeal, may, have, been, the, true, cause, for, this, papal, appointment, of, assistant, inquisitors, with, his, faith, in, his, mission, undiminished, but, stripped, of, any, real, power, torquemada, retired, to, the, monastery, of, st, thomas, aquinas, in, vila, in, 1494, typically, leaving, the, monastery, only, to, attend, to, the, royal, family, and, once, again, living, the, simple, life, of, a, friar, in, 1498, still, holding, the, office, of, grand, inquisitor, he, held, his, last, general, assembly, where, new, rules, were, formulated, to, assure, the, continuation, of, the, inquisition, in, spain, these, rules, attempted, to, curb, some, of, the, administrative, abuses, for, which, complaints, had, been, lodged, against, the, inquisition, after, fifteen, years, as, spain, s, grand, inquisitor, torquemada, died, in, the, monastery, on, 16, september, 1498, and, was, interred, there, his, tomb, was, ransacked, in, 1832, only, two, years, before, the, inquisition, was, finally, disbanded, his, bones, were, allegedly, stolen, and, ritually, incinerated, in, the, same, manner, as, an, auto, da, f
