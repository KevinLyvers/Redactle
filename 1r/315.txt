writings, were, in, russian, but, he, achieved, his, greatest, fame, with, the, novels, he, wrote, in, english, as, a, trilingual, also, writing, in, french, see, mademoiselle, o, master, he, has, been, compared, to, joseph, conrad, but, nabokov, disliked, both, the, comparison, and, conrad, s, work, he, lamented, to, the, critic, edmund, wilson, i, am, too, old, to, change, conradically, which, john, updike, later, called, itself, a, jest, of, genius, this, lament, came, in, 1941, when, nabokov, had, been, an, apprentice, american, for, less, than, one, year, 50, later, in, a, november, 1950, letter, to, wilson, nabokov, offers, a, solid, non, comic, appraisal, conrad, knew, how, to, handle, readymade, english, better, than, i, but, i, know, better, the, other, kind, he, never, sinks, to, the, depths, of, my, solecisms, but, neither, does, he, scale, my, verbal, peaks, 282, nabokov, translated, many, of, his, own, early, works, into, english, sometimes, in, collaboration, with, his, son, dmitri, his, trilingual, upbringing, had, a, profound, influence, on, his, art, nabokov, himself, translated, into, russian, two, books, he, originally, wrote, in, english, conclusive, evidence, and, lolita, the, translation, of, conclusive, evidence, was, made, because, nabokov, felt, that, the, english, version, was, imperfect, writing, the, book, he, noted, that, he, needed, to, translate, his, own, memories, into, english, and, to, spend, time, explaining, things, that, are, well, known, in, russia, he, decided, to, rewrite, the, book, in, his, native, language, before, making, the, final, version, speak, memory, nabokov, first, wanted, to, name, it, speak, mnemosyne, of, translating, lolita, nabokov, writes, i, imagined, that, in, some, distant, future, somebody, might, produce, a, russian, version, of, lolita, i, trained, my, inner, telescope, upon, that, particular, point, in, the, distant, future, and, i, saw, that, every, paragraph, pock, marked, as, it, is, with, pitfalls, could, lend, itself, to, hideous, mistranslation, in, the, hands, of, a, harmful, drudge, the, russian, version, of, lolita, would, be, entirely, degraded, and, botched, by, vulgar, paraphrases, or, blunders, so, i, decided, to, translate, it, myself, nabokov, was, a, proponent, of, individualism, and, rejected, concepts, and, ideologies, that, curtailed, individual, freedom, and, expression, such, as, totalitarianism, in, its, various, forms, as, well, as, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalysis, 412ff, poshlost, or, as, he, transcribed, it, poshlust, is, disdained, and, frequently, mocked, in, his, works, 628ff, nabokov, s, creative, processes, involved, writing, sections, of, text, on, hundreds, of, index, cards, which, he, expanded, into, paragraphs, and, chapters, and, rearranged, to, form, the, structure, of, his, novels, a, process, that, many, screenwriters, later, adopted, nabokov, published, under, the, pseudonym, vladimir, sirin, in, the, 1920s, to, 1940s, occasionally, to, mask, his, identity, from, critics, he, also, makes, cameo, appearances, in, some, of, his, novels, such, as, the, character, vivian, darkbloom, an, anagram, of, vladimir, nabokov, who, appears, in, both, lolita, and, ada, or, ardor, and, the, character, blavdak, vinomori, another, anagram, of, nabokov, s, name, in, king, queen, knave, sirin, is, referenced, as, a, different, migr, author, in, his, memoir, and, is, also, referenced, in, pnin, nabokov, is, noted, for, his, complex, plots, clever, word, play, daring, metaphors, and, prose, style, capable, of, both, parody, and, intense, lyricism, he, gained, both, fame, and, notoriety, with, lolita, 1955, which, recounts, a, grown, man, s, consuming, passion, for, a, 12, year, old, girl, this, and, his, other, novels, particularly, pale, fire, 1962, won, him, a, place, among, the, greatest, novelists, of, the, 20th, century, his, longest, novel, which, met, with, a, mixed, response, is, ada, 1969, he, devoted, more, time, to, the, composition, of, it, than, to, any, other, nabokov, s, fiction, is, characterized, by, linguistic, playfulness, for, example, his, short, story, the, vane, sisters, is, famous, in, part, for, its, acrostic, final, paragraph, in, which, the, first, letters, of, each, word, spell, out, a, message, from, beyond, the, grave, another, of, his, short, stories, signs, and, symbols, features, a, character, suffering, from, an, imaginary, illness, called, referential, mania, in, which, the, affected, perceives, a, world, of, environmental, objects, exchanging, coded, messages, nabokov, s, stature, as, a, literary, critic, is, founded, largely, on, his, four, volume, translation, of, and, commentary, on, alexander, pushkin, s, eugene, onegin, published, in, 1964, the, commentary, ends, with, an, appendix, titled, notes, on, prosody, which, has, developed, a, reputation, of, its, own, it, stemmed, from, his, observation, that, while, pushkin, s, iambic, tetrameters, had, been, a, part, of, russian, literature, for, a, fairly, short, two, centuries, they, were, clearly, understood, by, the, russian, prosodists, on, the, other, hand, he, viewed, the, much, older, english, iambic, tetrameters, as, muddled, and, poorly, documented, in, his, own, words, i, have, been, forced, to, invent, a, simple, little, terminology, of, my, own, explain, its, application, to, english, verse, forms, and, indulge, in, certain, rather, copious, details, of, classification, before, even, tackling, the, limited, object, of, these, notes, to, my, translation, of, pushkin, s, eugene, onegin, an, object, that, boils, down, to, very, little, in, comparison, to, the, forced, preliminaries, namely, to, a, few, things, that, the, non, russian, student, of, russian, literature, must, know, in, regard, to, russian, prosody, in, general, and, to, eugene, onegin, in, particular, nabokov, s, lectures, at, cornell, university, as, collected, in, lectures, on, literature, reveal, his, controversial, ideas, concerning, art, he, firmly, believed, that, novels, should, not, aim, to, teach, and, that, readers, should, not, merely, empathize, with, characters, but, that, a, higher, aesthetic, enjoyment, should, be, attained, partly, by, paying, great, attention, to, details, of, style, and, structure, he, detested, what, he, saw, as, general, ideas, in, novels, and, so, when, teaching, ulysses, for, example, he, would, insist, students, keep, an, eye, on, where, the, characters, were, in, dublin, with, the, aid, of, a, map, rather, than, teaching, the, complex, irish, history, that, many, critics, see, as, being, essential, to, an, understanding, of, the, novel, in, 2010, kitsch, magazine, a, student, publication, at, cornell, published, a, piece, that, focused, on, student, reflections, on, his, lectures, and, also, explored, nabokov, s, long, relationship, with, playboy, nabokov, also, wanted, his, students, to, describe, the, details, of, the, novels, rather, than, a, narrative, of, the, story, and, was, very, strict, when, it, came, to, grading, as, edward, jay, epstein, described, his, experience, in, nabokov, s, classes, nabokov, made, it, clear, from, the, very, first, lectures, that, he, had, little, interest, in, fraternizing, with, students, who, would, be, known, not, by, their, name, but, by, their, seat, number, the, russian, literary, critic, yuly, aykhenvald, was, an, early, admirer, of, nabokov, citing, in, particular, his, ability, to, imbue, objects, with, life, he, saturates, trivial, things, with, life, sense, and, psychology, and, gives, a, mind, to, objects, his, refined, senses, notice, colorations, and, nuances, smells, and, sounds, and, everything, acquires, an, unexpected, meaning, and, truth, under, his, gaze, and, through, his, words, the, critic, james, wood, argues, that, nabokov, s, use, of, descriptive, detail, proved, an, overpowering, and, not, always, very, fruitful, influence, on, two, or, three, generations, after, him, including, authors, such, as, martin, amis, and, john, updike, while, a, student, at, cornell, in, the, 1950s, thomas, pynchon, attended, several, of, nabokov, s, lectures, and, alluded, to, lolita, in, chapter, six, of, his, novel, the, crying, of, lot, 49, 1966, in, which, serge, countertenor, in, the, band, the, paranoids, sings, pynchon, s, prose, style, was, influenced, by, nabokov, s, preference, for, actualism, over, realism, of, the, authors, who, came, to, prominence, during, nabokov, s, life, john, banville, don, delillo, salman, rushdie, and, edmund, white, were, all, influenced, by, him, the, novelist, john, hawkes, took, inspiration, from, nabokov, and, considered, himself, his, follower, nabokov, s, story, signs, and, symbols, was, on, the, reading, list, for, hawkes, s, writing, students, at, brown, university, a, writer, who, truly, and, greatly, sustains, us, is, vladimir, nabokov, hawkes, said, in, a, 1964, interview, several, authors, who, came, to, prominence, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, have, also, cited, nabokov, s, work, as, a, literary, influence, aleksandar, hemon, has, acknowledged, the, latter, s, impact, on, his, writing, pulitzer, prize, winning, novelist, michael, chabon, listed, lolita, and, pale, fire, among, the, books, that, i, thought, changed, my, life, when, i, read, them, and, has, said, nabokov, s, english, combines, aching, lyricism, with, dispassionate, precision, in, a, way, that, seems, to, render, every, human, emotion, in, all, its, intensity, but, never, with, an, ounce, of, schmaltz, or, soggy, language, t, coraghessan, boyle, has, said, that, nabokov, s, playfulness, and, the, ravishing, beauty, of, his, prose, are, ongoing,
