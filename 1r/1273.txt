the, exact, nature, of, the, mental, illness, is, not, known, definitively, but, historians, and, medical, experts, have, suggested, that, his, symptoms, and, behaviour, traits, were, consistent, with, either, bipolar, disorder, or, porphyria, in, 1810, george, suffered, a, final, relapse, and, his, eldest, son, the, prince, of, wales, was, named, prince, regent, the, following, year, the, king, died, aged, 81, at, which, time, the, regent, succeeded, him, as, george, iv, george, iii, reigned, during, much, of, the, georgian, and, regency, eras, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was,

wales, and, augusta, of, saxe, gotha, as, he, was, born, two, months, prematurely, and, thought, unlikely, to, survive, he, was, baptised, the, same, day, by, thomas, secker, who, was, both, rector,

brother, edward, later, duke, of, york, and, albany, were, educated, together, by, private, tutors, family, letters, show, that, he, could, read, and, write, in, both, english, and, german, as, well, as, comment, on, political, events, of, the, time, by, the, age, of, eight, he, was, the, first, british, monarch, to, study, science, systematically, apart, from, chemistry, and, physics, his,

the, new, prologue, what, tho, a, boy, it, may, with, truth, be, said, a, boy, in, england, born, in, england, bred, historian, romney, sedgwick, argued, that, these, lines, appear, to, be, the, source, of, the, only, historical, phrase, with, which, he, is, associated, king, george, ii, disliked, prince, frederick, and, took, little, interest, in, his, grandchildren, however, in, 1751, frederick, died, unexpectedly, from, a, lung, injury, at, the, age, of, 44, and, his, son, george, became, heir, apparent, to, the, throne, and, inherited, his, father, s, title, of, duke, of, edinburgh, the, king, now, took, more, interest, in, his, grandson, and, created, him, prince, of, wales, three, weeks, later, in, the, spring, of, 1756, as, george, approached, his, eighteenth, birthday, the, king, offered, him, a, grand, establishment, at, st, james, s, palace, but, george, refused, the, offer, guided, by, his, mother, and, her, confidant, lord, bute, who, later, served, as, prime, minister, george, s, mother, now, the, dowager, princess, of, wales, preferred, to, keep, george, at, home, where, she, could, imbue, him, with, her, strict, moral, values, in, 1759, george, was, smitten, with, lady, sarah, lennox, sister, of, charles, lennox, 3rd, duke, of, richmond, but, lord, bute, advised, against, the, match, and, george, abandoned, his, thoughts, of, marriage, i, am, born, for, the, happiness, or, misery, of, a, great, nation, he, wrote, and, consequently, must, often, act, contrary, to, my, passions, nevertheless, george, and, his, mother, resisted, attempts, by, the, king, to, marry, george, to, princess, sophie, caroline, of, brunswick, wolfenb, ttel, sophie, caroline, instead, married, frederick, margrave, of, bayreuth, the, following, year, at, the, age, of, 22, george, succeeded, to, the, throne, when, his, grandfather, george, ii, died, suddenly, on, 25, october, 1760, at, age, 76, the, search, for, a, suitable, wife, intensified, after, giving, consideration, to, a, number, of, protestant, german, princesses, george, s, mother, sent, colonel, david, graeme, with, on, her, son, s, behalf, an, offer, of, marriage, to, princess, charlotte, of, mecklenburg, strelitz, charlotte, accepted, while, a, royal, household, and, staff, were, assembled, for, charlotte, in, london, lord, harcourt, the, royal, master, of, the, horse, escorted, her, from, strelitz, to, london, charlotte, arrived, in, the, afternoon, of, 8, september, 1761, and, the, marriage, ceremony, was, conducted, that, same, evening, in, the, chapel, royal, st, james, s, palace, george, and, charlotte, s, coronation, was, held, at, westminster, abbey, a, fortnight, later, on, 22, september, george, never, took, a, mistress, in, contrast, with, his, grandfather, and, his, sons, and, the, couple, enjoyed, a, happy, marriage, until, his, mental, illness, struck, the, king, and, queen, had, 15, children, nine, sons, and, six, daughters, in, 1762, george, purchased, buckingham, house, on, the, site, now, occupied, by, buckingham, palace, for, use, as, a, family, retreat, his, other, residences, were, kew, palace, and, windsor, castle, st, james, s, palace, was, retained, for, official, use, he, did, not, travel, extensively, and, spent, his, entire, life, in, southern, england, in, the, 1790s, the, king, and, his, family, took, holidays, at, weymouth, dorset, which, he, thus, popularised, as, one, of, the, first, seaside, resorts, in, england, george, in, his, accession, speech, to, parliament, proclaimed, born, and, educated, in, this, country, i, glory, in, the, name, of, britain, he, inserted, this, phrase, into, the, speech, written, by, lord, hardwicke, to, demonstrate, his, desire, to, distance, himself, from, his, german, forebears, who, were, perceived, as, caring, more, for, hanover, than, for, britain, during, george, iii, s, lengthy, reign, britain, was, a, constitutional, monarchy, ruled, by, his, ministerial, government, and, prominent, men, in, parliament, although, his, accession, was, at, first, welcomed, by, politicians, of, all, parties, the, first, years, of, his, reign, were, marked, by, political, instability, largely, as, a, result, of, disagreements, over, the, seven, years, war, george, came, to, be, perceived, as, favouring, tory, ministers, which, led, to, his, denunciation, by, the, whigs, as, an, autocrat, on, his, accession, the, crown, lands, produced, relatively, little, income, most, revenue, was, generated, through, taxes, and, excise, duties, george, surrendered, the, crown, estate, to, parliamentary, control, in, return, for, a, civil, list, annuity, for, the, support, of, his, household, and, the, expenses, of, civil, government, claims, that, he, used, the, income, to, reward, supporters, with, bribes, and, gifts, are, disputed, by, historians, who, say, such, claims, rest, on, nothing, but, falsehoods, put, out, by, disgruntled, opposition, debts, amounting, to, over, 3, million, over, the, course, of, george, s, reign, were, paid, by, parliament, and, the, civil, list, annuity, was, increased, from, time, to, time, he, aided, the, royal, academy, of, arts, with, large, grants, from, his, private, funds, and, may, have, donated, more, than, half, of, his, personal, income, to, charity, of, his, art, collection, the, two, most, notable, purchases, are, johannes, vermeer, s, lady, at, the, virginals, and, a, set, of, canalettos, but, it, is, as, a, collector, of, books, that, he, is, best, remembered, the, king, s, library, was, open, and, available, to, scholars, and, was, the, foundation, of, a, new, national, library, in, may, 1762, the, incumbent, whig, government, of, thomas, pelham, holles, 1st, duke, of, newcastle, was, replaced, with, one, led, by, lord, bute, a, scottish, tory, bute, s, opponents, worked, against, him, by, spreading, the, calumny, that, he, was, having, an, affair, with, the, king, s, mother, and, by, exploiting, anti, scottish, sentiment, amongst, the, english, john, wilkes, a, member, of, parliament, published, the, north, briton, which, was, both, inflammatory, and, defamatory, in, its, condemnation, of, bute, and, the, government, wilkes, was, eventually, arrested, for, seditious, libel, but, he, fled, to, france, to, escape, punishment, he, was, expelled, from, the, house, of, commons, and, found, guilty, in, absentia, of, blasphemy, and, libel, in, 1763, after, concluding, the, peace, of, paris, which, ended, the, war, lord, bute, resigned, allowing, the, whigs, under, george, grenville, to, return, to, power, britain, received, enormous, concessions, including, west, florida, britain, restored, to, france, lucrative, slave, sugar, islands, in, the, west, indies, including, guadeloupe, and, martinique, france, ceded, canada, to, britain, in, addition, to, all, land, between, the, allegheny, mountains, and, the, mississippi, river, except, new, orleans, which, was, ceded, to, spain, later, that, year, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, placed, a, limit, upon, the, westward, expansion, of, the, american, colonies, and, created, an, indian, reserve, the, proclamation, aimed, to, divert, colonial, expansion, to, the, north, to, nova, scotia, and, to, the, south, florida, and, protect, the, british, fur, trade, with, the, indians, the, proclamation, line, did, not, bother, the, majority, of, settled, farmers, but, it, was, unpopular, with, a, vocal, minority, this, discontent, ultimately, contributed, to, conflict, between, the, colonists, and, the, british, government, with, the, american, colonists, generally, unburdened, by, british, taxes, the, government, thought, it, appropriate, for, them, to, pay, towards, the, defence, of, the, colonies, against, native, uprisings, and, the, possibility, of, french, incursions, the, central, issue, for, the, colonists, was, not, the, amount, of, taxes, but, whether, parliament, could, levy, a, tax, without, american, approval, for, there, were, no, american, seats, in, parliament, the, americans, protested, that, like, all, englishmen, they, had, rights, to, no, taxation, without, representation, in, 1765, grenville, introduced, the, stamp, act, which, levied, a, stamp, duty, on, every, document, in, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, since, newspapers, were, printed, on, stamped, paper, those, most, affected, by, the, introduction, of, the, duty, were, the, most, effective, at, producing, propaganda, opposing, the, tax, meanwhile, george, had, become, exasperated, at, grenville, s, attempts, to, reduce, the, king, s, prerogatives, and, tried, unsuccessfully, to, persuade, william, pitt, the, elder, to, accept, the, office, of, prime, minister, after, a, brief, illness, which, may, have, presaged, his, illnesses, to, come, george, settled, on, lord, rockingham, to, form, a, ministry, and, dismissed, grenville, lord, rockingham, with, the, support, of, pitt, and, the, king, repealed, grenville, s, unpopular, stamp, act, rockingham, s, government, was, weak, and, he, was, replaced, as, prime, minister, in, 1766, by, pitt, whom, george, created, earl, of, chatham, the, actions, of, lord, chatham, and, george, iii, in, repealing, the, act, were, so, popular, in, america, that, statues, of, them, both, were, erected, in, new, york, city, lord, chatham, fell, ill, in, 1767, and, augustus, fitzroy, 3rd, duke, of, grafton, took, over, the, government, grafton, did, not, formally, become, prime, minister, until, 1768, that, year, john, wilkes, returned, to, england, stood, as, a, candidate, in, the, general, election, and, came, top, of, the, poll, in, the, middlesex, constituency, wilkes, was, again, expelled, from, parliament, he, was, re, elected, and, expelled, twice, more, before, the, house, of, commons, resolved, that, his, candidature, was, invalid, and, declared, the, runner, up, as, the, victor, grafton, s, government, disintegrated, in, 1770, allowing, the, tories, led, by, lord, north, to, return, to, power, george, was, deeply, devout, and, spent, hours, in, prayer, but, his, piety, was, not, shared, by, his, brothers, george, was, appalled, by, what, he, saw, as, their, loose, morals, in, 1770, his, brother, prince, henry, duke, of, cumberland, and, strathearn, was, exposed, as, an, adulterer, the, following, year, henry, married, a, young, widow, anne, horton, the, king, considered, her, inappropriate, as, a, royal, bride, she, was, from, a, lower, social, class, and, german, law, barred, any, children, of, the, couple, from, the, hanoverian, succession, george, insisted, on, a, new, law, that, essentially, forbade, members, of, the, royal, family, from, legally, marrying, without, the, consent, of, the, sovereign, the, subsequent, bill, was, unpopular, in, parliament, including, among, george, s, own, ministers, but, passed, as, the, royal, marriages, act, 1772, shortly, afterwards, another, of, george, s, brothers, prince, william, henry, duke, of, gloucester, and, edinburgh, revealed, he, had, been, secretly, married, to, maria, countess, waldegrave, the, illegitimate, daughter, of, sir, edward, walpole, the, news, confirmed, george, s, opinion, that, he, had, been, right, to, introduce, the, law, maria, was, related, to, his, political, opponents, neither, lady, was, ever, received, at, court, lord, north, s, government, was, chiefly, concerned, with, discontent, in, america, to, assuage, american, opinion, most, of, the, custom, duties, were, withdrawn, except, for, the, tea, duty, which, in, george, s, words, was, one, tax, to, keep, up, the, right, in, 1773, the, tea, ships, moored, in, boston, harbor, were, boarded, by, colonists, and, the, tea, was, thrown, overboard, an, event, that, became, known, as, the, boston, tea, party, in, britain, opinion, hardened, against, the, colonists, with, chatham, now, agreeing, with, north, that, the, destruction, of, the, tea, was, certainly, criminal, with, the, clear, support, of, parliament, lord, north, introduced, measures, which, were, called, the, intolerable, acts, by, the, colonists, the, port, of, boston, was, shut, down, and, the, charter, of, massachusetts, was, altered, so, that, the, upper, house, of, the, legislature, was, appointed, by, the, crown, instead, of, elected, by, the, lower, house, up, to, this, point, in, the, words, of, professor, peter, thomas, george, s, hopes, were, centred, on, a, political, solution, and, he, always, bowed, to, his, cabinet, s, opinions, even, when, sceptical, of, their, success, the, detailed, evidence, of, the, years, from, 1763, to, 1775, tends, to, exonerate, george, iii, from, any, real, responsibility, for, the, american, revolution, though, both, the, americans, and, older, british, historians, characterised, george, as, a, tyrant, in, these, years, he, acted, as, a, constitutional, monarch, supporting, the, initiatives, of, his, ministers, the, american, war, of, independence, was, the, culmination, of, the, civil, and, political, american, revolution, in, the, 1760s, a, series, of, acts, by, parliament, was, met, with, resistance, in, britain, s, thirteen, colonies, in, america, in, particular, they, rejected, new, taxes, levied, by, parliament, a, body, in, which, they, had, no, direct, representation, the, colonies, had, previously, enjoyed, a, high, level, of, autonomy, in, their, internal, affairs, and, viewed, parliament, s, acts, as, a, denial, of, their, rights, as, englishmen, armed, conflict, began, between, british, regulars, and, colonial, militiamen, at, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, in, april, 1775, the, second, continental, congress, sent, petitions, to, the, crown, for, intervention, with, parliament, but, the, king, and, parliament, ignored, them, george, declared, the, american, leaders, to, be, traitors, and, a, year, of, fighting, ensued, thomas, paine, s, book, common, sense, referred, to, george, iii, as, the, royal, brute, of, great, britain, the, colonies, declared, their, independence, in, july, 1776, listing, twenty, seven, grievances, against, the, british, king, and, legislature, while, asking, the, support, of, the, populace, among, george, s, other, offenses, the, declaration, charged, he, has, abdicated, government, here, he, has, plundered, our, seas, ravaged, our, coasts, burnt, our, towns, and, destroyed, the, lives, of, our, people, the, gilded, equestrian, statue, of, the, king, in, new, york, was, pulled, down, the, british, captured, the, city, in, 1776, but, lost, boston, and, the, grand, strategic, plan, of, invading, from, canada, and, cutting, off, new, england, failed, with, the, surrender, of, british, lieutenant, general, john, burgoyne, following, the, battles, of, saratoga, prime, minister, lord, north, was, not, an, ideal, war, leader, but, george, iii, managed, to, give, parliament, a, sense, of, purpose, to, fight, and, north, was, able, to, keep, his, cabinet, together, north, s, cabinet, ministers, the, earl, of, sandwich, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, and, lord, george, germain, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, proved, to, lack, leadership, skills, suited, for, their, positions, george, iii, is, often, accused, of, obstinately, trying, to, keep, great, britain, at, war, with, the, rebels, despite, the, opinions, of, his, own, ministers, in, the, words, of, british, historian, george, otto, trevelyan, the, king, was, determined, never, to, acknowledge, the, independence, of, the, americans, and, to, punish, their, contumacy, by, the, indefinite, prolongation, of, a, war, which, promised, to, be, eternal, he, wanted, to, keep, the, rebels, harassed, anxious, and, poor, until, the, day, when, by, a, natural, and, inevitable, process, discontent, and, disappointment, were, converted, into, penitence, and, remorse, later, historians, defend, george, by, saying, that, in, the, context, of, the, times, no, king, would, willingly, surrender, such, a, large, territory, and, his, conduct, was, far, less, ruthless, than, contemporaneous, monarchs, in, europe, after, saratoga, both, parliament, and, the, british, people, were, in, favour, of, the, war, recruitment, ran, at, high, levels, and, political, opponents, though, vocal, remained, a, small, minority, with, the, setbacks, in, america, lord, north, asked, to, transfer, power, to, lord, chatham, whom, he, thought, more, capable, but, george, refused, to, do, so, he, suggested, instead, that, chatham, serve, as, a, subordinate, minister, in, north, s, administration, but, chatham, refused, he, died, later, in, the, same, year, north, was, allied, to, the, king, s, friends, in, parliament, and, believed, that, george, iii, had, the, right, to, exercise, powers, in, early, 1778, louis, xvi, of, france, britain, s, chief, rival, signed, a, treaty, of, alliance, with, the, united, states, the, french, fleet, outran, the, british, naval, blockade, of, the, mediterranean, and, sailed, to, america, the, conflict, now, affected, america, europe, and, india, charles, iii, of, spain, had, misgivings, because, of, his, own, colonies, but, decided, to, side, with, france, in, the, war, in, limited, fashion, in, 1779, one, faction, of, the, dutch, republic, aided, the, americans, whereas, another, aided, britain, whose, allies, included, loyalists, and, german, auxiliaries, lord, gower, and, lord, weymouth, both, resigned, from, the, government, lord, north, again, requested, that, he, also, be, allowed, to, resign, but, he, stayed, in, office, at, george, iii, s, insistence, during, the, summer, of, 1779, a, combined, french, spanish, naval, fleet, threatened, to, invade, england, and, transport, 31, 000, french, troops, across, the, english, channel, george, iii, said, that, britain, was, confronted, by, the, most, serious, crisis, the, nation, ever, knew, in, august, 66, warships, entered, the, english, channel, but, sickness, hunger, and, adverse, winds, forced, the, french, spanish, armada, to, withdraw, ending, the, invasion, threat, in, late, 1779, george, iii, advocated, sending, more, british, warships, and, troops, across, the, atlantic, to, the, west, indies, he, boldly, said, we, must, risk, something, otherwise, we, will, only, vegetate, in, this, war, i, own, i, wish, either, with, spirit, to, get, through, it, or, with, a, crash, be, ruined, in, january, 1780, 7, 000, british, troops, under, general, sir, john, vaughan, were, transported, to, the, west, indies, nonetheless, opposition, to, the, costly, war, was, increasing, and, in, june, 1780, contributed, to, disturbances, in, london, known, as, the, gordon, riots, as, late, as, the, siege, of, charleston, in, 1780, loyalists, could, still, believe, in, their, eventual, victory, as, british, troops, inflicted, defeats, on, the, continental, forces, at, the, battle, of, camden, and, the, battle, of, guilford, court, house, in, late, 1781, the, news, of, lord, cornwallis, s, surrender, at, the, siege, of, yorktown, reached, london, north, s, parliamentary, support, ebbed, away, and, he, resigned, the, following, year, george, drafted, an, abdication, notice, which, was, never, delivered, he, finally, accepted, the, defeat, in, america, and, authorized, peace, negotiations, britain, formally, recognized, the, independence, of, the, united, states, in, the, treaties, of, paris, signed, in, 1782, and, 1783, in, early, 1783, george, iii, privately, conceded, america, is, lost, he, reflected, that, the, northern, colonies, had, developed, into, britain, s, successful, rivals, in, commercial, trade, and, fishing, up, to, 70, 000, loyalists, fled, to, canada, the, caribbean, or, england, john, adams, was, appointed, american, minister, to, london, in, 1785, by, which, time, george, had, become, resigned, to, the, new, relationship, between, his, country, and, the, former, colonies, he, told, adams, i, was, the, last, to, consent, to, the, separation, but, the, separation, having, been, made, and, having, become, inevitable, i, have, always, said, as, i, say, now, that, i, would, be, the, first, to, meet, the, friendship, of, the, united, states, as, an, independent, power, with, the, collapse, of, lord, north, s, ministry, in, 1782, the, whig, lord, rockingham, became, prime, minister, for, the, second, time, but, died, within, months, the, king, then, appointed, lord, shelburne, to, replace, him, charles, james, fox, however, refused, to, serve, under, shelburne, and, demanded, the, appointment, of, william, cavendish, bentinck, 3rd, duke, of, portland, in, 1783, the, house, of, commons, forced, shelburne, from, office, and, his, government, was, replaced, by, the, fox, north, coalition, portland, became, prime, minister, with, fox, and, lord, north, as, foreign, secretary, and, home, secretary, respectively, the, king, disliked, fox, intensely, for, his, politics, as, well, as, his, character, he, thought, fox, unprincipled, and, a, bad, influence, on, the, prince, of, wales, george, iii, was, distressed, at, having, to, appoint, ministers, not, of, his, liking, but, the, portland, ministry, quickly, built, up, a, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, and, could, not, be, displaced, easily, he, was, further, dismayed, when, the, government, introduced, the, india, bill, which, proposed, to, reform, the, government, of, india, by, transferring, political, power, from, the, east, india, company, to, parliamentary, commissioners, although, george, actually, favoured, greater, control, over, the, company, the, proposed, commissioners, were, all, political, allies, of, fox, immediately, after, the, house, of, commons, passed, it, george, authorised, lord, temple, to, inform, the, house, of, lords, that, he, would, regard, any, peer, who, voted, for, the, bill, as, his, enemy, the, bill, was, rejected, by, the, lords, three, days, later, the, portland, ministry, was, dismissed, and, william, pitt, the, younger, was, appointed, prime, minister, with, temple, as, his, secretary, of, state, on, 17, december, 1783, parliament, voted, in, favour, of, a, motion, condemning, the, influence, of, the, monarch, in, parliamentary, voting, as, a, high, crime, and, temple, was, forced, to, resign, temple, s, departure, destabilised, the, government, and, three, months, later, the, government, lost, its, majority, and, parliament, was, dissolved, the, subsequent, election, gave, pitt, a, firm, mandate, pitt, s, appointment, was, a, great, victory, for, george, it, proved, that, the, king, could, appoint, prime, ministers, on, the, basis, of, his, own, interpretation, of, the, public, mood, without, having, to, follow, the, choice, of, the, current, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, throughout, pitt, s, ministry, george, supported, many, of, pitt, s, political, aims, and, created, new, peers, at, an, unprecedented, rate, to, increase, the, number, of, pitt, s, supporters, in, the, house, of, lords, during, and, after, pitt, s, ministry, george, was, extremely, popular, in, britain, the, british, people, admired, him, for, his, piety, and, for, remaining, faithful, to, his, wife, he, was, fond, of, his, children, and, was, devastated, at, the, death, of, two, of, his, sons, in, infancy, in, 1782, and, 1783, respectively, nevertheless, he, set, his, children, a, strict, regimen, they, were, expected, to, attend, rigorous, lessons, from, seven, in, the, morning, and, to, lead, lives, of, religious, observance, and, virtue, when, his, children, strayed, from, george, s, principles, of, righteousness, as, his, sons, did, as, young, adults, he, was, dismayed, and, disappointed, by, this, time, george, s, health, was, deteriorating, he, had, a, mental, illness, characterised, by, acute, mania, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, king, s, illness, was, generally, considered, to, be, psychological, in, 1966, a, study, by, ida, macalpine, and, richard, hunter, suggested, that, the, illness, was, physiological, caused, by, the, liver, disorder, porphyria, although, meeting, with, some, contemporary, opposition, the, view, gained, widespread, scholarly, acceptance, a, study, of, samples, of, george, s, hair, published, in, 2005, revealed, high, levels, of, arsenic, a, cause, of, metabolic, blood, disorders, and, thus, a, possible, trigger, for, porphyria, the, source, of, the, arsenic, is, not, known, but, it, could, have, been, a, component, of, medicines, or, cosmetics, the, theory, was, also, established, in, the, public, mind, through, influential, dramatisations, such, as, alan, bennett, s, play, the, madness, of, george, iii, and, in, nicholas, hytner, s, subsequent, film, from, 2010, this, view, has, been, increasingly, challenged, and, macalpine, and, hunter, s, study, criticised, recent, scholarship, discounts, the, porphyria, theory, and, contends, that, george, s, illness, was, psychiatric, most, probably, bipolar, disorder, george, may, have, had, a, brief, episode, of, disease, in, 1765, and, a, longer, episode, began, in, the, summer, of, 1788, at, the, end, of, the, parliamentary, session, he, went, to, cheltenham, spa, to, recuperate, and, in, august, visited, the, bishop, of, worcester, at, hartlebury, castle, and, viscount, mount, edgcumbe, at, cotehele, cornwall, with, the, queen, and, their, daughters, the, princess, royal, and, princesses, augusta, and, elizabeth, it, was, the, furthest, he, had, ever, been, from, london, but, his, condition, worsened, in, november, of, that, year, he, became, seriously, deranged, sometimes, speaking, for, many, hours, without, pause, causing, him, to, foam, at, the, mouth, and, his, voice, to, become, hoarse, george, would, frequently, repeat, himself, and, write, sentences, with, over, 400, words, at, a, time, and, his, vocabulary, became, more, complex, creative, and, colourful, possible, symptoms, of, bipolar, disorder, his, doctors, were, largely, at, a, loss, to, explain, his, illness, and, spurious, stories, about, his, condition, spread, such, as, the, claim, that, he, had, shaken, hands, with, a, tree, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, it, was, the, king, of, prussia, treatment, for, mental, illness, was, primitive, by, modern, standards, george, s, doctors, who, included, francis, willis, treated, the, king, by, forcibly, restraining, him, until, he, was, calm, or, applying, caustic, poultices, to, draw, out, evil, humours, in, the, reconvened, parliament, fox, and, pitt, wrangled, over, the, terms, of, a, regency, during, the, king, s, incapacity, while, both, agreed, that, it, would, be, most, reasonable, for, the, prince, of, wales, to, act, as, regent, fox, suggested, to, pitt, s, consternation, that, it, was, the, prince, s, absolute, right, to, act, on, his, ill, father, s, behalf, with, full, powers, pitt, fearing, he, would, be, removed, from, office, if, the, prince, of, wales, were, empowered, argued, that, it, was, for, parliament, to, nominate, a, regent, and, wanted, to, restrict, the, regent, s, authority, in, february, 1789, the, regency, bill, authorising, the, prince, of, wales, to, act, as, regent, was, introduced, and, passed, in, the, house, of, commons, but, before, the, house, of, lords, could, pass, the, bill, george, recovered, after, george, s, recovery, his, popularity, and, that, of, pitt, continued, to, increase, at, the, expense, of, fox, and, the, prince, of, wales, his, humane, and, understanding, treatment, of, two, insane, assailants, margaret, nicholson, in, 1786, and, john, frith, in, 1790, contributed, to, his, popularity, james, hadfield, s, failed, attempt, to, shoot, george, in, the, theatre, royal, drury, lane, on, 15, may, 1800, was, not, political, in, origin, but, motivated, by, the, apocalyptic, delusions, of, hadfield, and, bannister, truelock, george, seemed, unperturbed, by, the, incident, so, much, so, that, he, fell, asleep, in, the, interval, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, in, which, the, french, monarchy, had, been, overthrown, worried, many, british, landowners, france, declared, war, on, great, britain, in, 1793, in, response, to, the, crisis, george, allowed, pitt, to, increase, taxes, raise, armies, and, suspend, the, right, of, habeas, corpus, pitt, prosecuted, british, radicals, for, treason, in, 1794, and, in, october, 1795, crowds, attacked, george, s, carriage, on, his, way, to, opening, parliament, demanding, an, end, to, the, war, and, lower, bread, prices, in, response, parliament, passed, the, treason, and, seditious, meetings, acts, a, month, later, the, first, coalition, to, oppose, revolutionary, france, which, included, austria, prussia, and, spain, broke, up, in, 1795, when, prussia, and, spain, made, separate, peace, with, france, the, second, coalition, which, included, austria, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, was, defeated, in, 1800, only, great, britain, was, left, fighting, napoleon, bonaparte, the, first, consul, of, the, french, republic, a, brief, lull, in, hostilities, allowed, pitt, to, concentrate, effort, on, ireland, where, there, had, been, an, uprising, and, attempted, french, landing, in, 1798, in, 1800, the, british, and, irish, parliaments, passed, an, act, of, union, that, took, effect, on, 1, january, 1801, and, united, great, britain, and, ireland, into, a, single, state, known, as, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, george, used, the, opportunity, to, abandon, the, title, king, of, france, which, english, and, british, sovereigns, had, maintained, since, the, reign, of, edward, iii, it, was, suggested, that, george, adopt, the, title, emperor, of, the, british, isles, but, he, refused, as, part, of, his, irish, policy, pitt, planned, to, remove, certain, legal, disabilities, that, applied, to, roman, catholics, george, iii, claimed, that, to, emancipate, catholics, would, be, to, violate, his, coronation, oath, in, which, sovereigns, promise, to, maintain, protestantism, faced, with, opposition, to, his, religious, reform, policies, from, both, the, king, and, the, british, public, pitt, threatened, to, resign, at, about, the, same, time, george, had, a, relapse, of, his, previous, illness, which, he, blamed, on, worry, over, the, catholic, question, on, 14, march, 1801, pitt, was, formally, replaced, by, the, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, henry, addington, addington, opposed, emancipation, instituted, annual, accounts, abolished, income, tax, and, began, a, programme, of, disarmament, in, october, 1801, he, made, peace, with, the, french, and, in, 1802, signed, the, treaty, of, amiens, george, did, not, consider, the, peace, with, france, as, real, in, his, view, it, was, an, experiment, the, war, resumed, in, 1803, but, public, opinion, distrusted, addington, to, lead, the, nation, in, war, and, instead, favoured, pitt, an, invasion, of, england, by, napoleon, seemed, imminent, and, a, massive, volunteer, movement, arose, to, defend, england, against, the, french, george, s, review, of, 27, 000, volunteers, in, hyde, park, london, on, 26, and, 28, october, 1803, and, at, the, height, of, the, invasion, scare, attracted, an, estimated, 500, 000, spectators, on, each, day, the, times, said, the, enthusiasm, of, the, multitude, was, beyond, all, expression, a, courtier, wrote, on, 13, november, that, the, king, is, really, prepared, to, take, the, field, in, case, of, attack, his, beds, are, ready, and, he, can, move, at, half, an, hour, s, warning, george, wrote, to, his, friend, bishop, hurd, we, are, here, in, daily, expectation, that, bonaparte, will, attempt, his, threatened, invasion, should, his, troops, effect, a, landing, i, shall, certainly, put, myself, at, the, head, of, mine, and, my, other, armed, subjects, to, repel, them, after, admiral, lord, nelson, s, famous, naval, victory, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, the, possibility, of, invasion, was, extinguished, in, 1804, george, s, recurrent, illness, returned, after, his, recovery, addington, resigned, and, pitt, regained, power, pitt, sought, to, appoint, fox, to, his, ministry, but, george, refused, lord, grenville, perceived, an, injustice, to, fox, and, refused, to, join, the, new, ministry, pitt, concentrated, on, forming, a, coalition, with, austria, russia, and, sweden, this, third, coalition, however, met, the, same, fate, as, the, first, and, second, coalitions, collapsing, in, 1805, the, setbacks, in, europe, took, a, toll, on, pitt, s, health, and, he, died, in, 1806, reopening, the, question, of, who, should, serve, in, the, ministry, grenville, became, prime, minister, and, his, ministry, of, all, the, talents, included, fox, grenville, pushed, through, the, slave, trade, act, 1807, which, passed, both, houses, of, parliament, with, large, majorities, george, was, conciliatory, towards, fox, after, being, forced, to, capitulate, over, his, appointment, after, fox, s, death, in, september, 1806, the, king, and, ministry, were, in, open, conflict, to, boost, recruitment, the, ministry, proposed, a, measure, in, february, 1807, whereby, roman, catholics, would, be, allowed, to, serve, in, all, ranks, of, the, armed, forces, george, instructed, them, not, only, to, drop, the, measure, but, also, to, agree, never, to, set, up, such, a, measure, again, the, ministers, agreed, to, drop, the, measure, then, pending, but, refused, to, bind, themselves, in, the, future, they, were, dismissed, and, replaced, by, the, duke, of, portland, as, the, nominal, prime, minister, with, actual, power, being, held, by, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, spencer, perceval, parliament, was, dissolved, and, the, subsequent, election, gave, the, ministry, a, strong, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, george, iii, made, no, further, major, political, decisions, during, his, reign, the, replacement, of, portland, by, perceval, in, 1809, was, of, little, real, significance, in, late, 1810, at, the, height, of, his, popularity, king, george, already, virtually, blind, with, cataracts, and, in, pain, from, rheumatism, suffered, a, relapse, into, his, mental, disorder, and, became, dangerously, ill, in, his, view, the, malady, had, been, triggered, by, stress, over, the, death, of, his, youngest, and, favourite, daughter, princess, amelia, the, princess, s, nurse, reported, that, the, scenes, of, distress, and, crying, every, day, were, melancholy, beyond, description, george, accepted, the, need, for, the, regency, act, 1811, and, the, prince, of, wales, later, george, iv, acted, as, regent, for, the, remainder, of, the, king, s, life, despite, signs, of, a, recovery, in, may, 1811, by, the, end, of, the, year, george, iii, had, become, permanently, insane, and, lived, in, seclusion, at, windsor, castle, until, his, death, prime, minister, spencer, perceval, was, assassinated, in, 1812, and, was, replaced, by, lord, liverpool, liverpool, oversaw, british, victory, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, subsequent, congress, of, vienna, led, to, significant, territorial, gains, for, hanover, which, was, elevated, from, an, electorate, to, a, kingdom, meanwhile, george, s, health, deteriorated, he, developed, dementia, and, became, completely, blind, and, increasingly, deaf, he, was, incapable, of, knowing, or, understanding, that, he, was, declared, king, of, hanover, in, 1814, or, that, his, wife, died, in, 1818, at, christmas, 1819, he, spoke, nonsense, for, 58, hours, and, for, the, last, few, weeks, of, his, life, was, unable, to, walk, he, died, of, pneumonia, at, windsor, castle, at, 8, 38, pm, on, 29, january, 1820, six, days, after, the, death, of, his, fourth, son, prince, edward, duke, of, kent, and, strathearn, his, favourite, son, prince, frederick, duke, of, york, and, albany, was, with, him, george, iii, lay, in, state, for, two, days, and, his, funeral, and, interment, took, place, on, 16, february, in, st, george, s, chapel, windsor, castle, over, the, course, of, george, s, reign, a, coalition, of, abolitionists, and, atlantic, slave, uprisings, caused, the, british, public, to, spurn, slavery, according, to, the, historian, andrew, roberts, george, never, bought, or, sold, a, slave, in, his, life, he, never, invested, in, any, of, the, companies, that, did, such, a, thing, he, signed, legislation, to, abolish, slavery, george, wrote, a, document, in, the, 1750s, denouncing, all, of, the, arguments, for, slavery, and, calling, them, an, execration, and, ridiculous, and, absurd, but, the, king, and, his, son, the, duke, of, clarence, supported, the, efforts, of, the, london, society, of, west, india, planters, and, merchants, to, delay, the, abolition, of, the, british, slave, trade, for, almost, 20, years, william, pitt, the, younger, conversely, wished, to, see, slavery, abolished, but, because, the, cabinet, was, divided, and, the, king, was, in, the, pro, slavery, camp, pitt, decided, to, refrain, from, making, abolition, official, government, policy, instead, he, worked, toward, abolition, in, an, individual, capacity, on, 7, november, 1775, during, the, american, war, of, independence, john, murray, lord, dunmore, issued, a, proclamation, that, offered, freedom, to, the, slaves, of, rebel, masters, if, they, enlisted, to, put, down, the, colonial, rebellion, dunmore, was, the, last, royal, governor, of, virginia, appointed, by, king, george, iii, in, july, 1771, dunmore, s, proclamation, inspired, slaves, to, escape, from, captivity, and, fight, for, the, british, on, 30, june, 1779, george, iii, s, commanding, general, henry, clinton, broadened, dunmore, s, proclamation, with, his, philipsburg, proclamation, for, all, colonial, slaves, who, fled, their, rebel, masters, clinton, forbade, their, recapture, and, resale, giving, them, protection, by, the, british, military, approximately, 20, 000, freed, slaves, joined, the, british, fighting, for, george, iii, in, 1783, given, british, certificates, of, freedom, 3, 000, former, slaves, including, their, families, settled, in, nova, scotia, between, 1791, and, 1800, almost, 400, 000, africans, were, shipped, to, the, americas, by, 1, 340, slaving, voyages, mounted, from, british, ports, including, liverpool, and, bristol, on, 25, march, 1807, george, iii, signed, into, law, an, act, for, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, under, which, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, was, banned, in, the, british, empire, george, was, succeeded, by, two, of, his, sons, george, iv, and, william, iv, in, turn, who, both, died, without, surviving, legitimate, children, leaving, the, throne, to, victoria, the, only, legitimate, child, of, his, fourth, son, prince, edward, george, iii, lived, for, 81, years, and, 239, days, and, reigned, for, 59, years, and, 96, days, both, his, life, and, his, reign, were, longer, than, those, of, any, of, his, predecessors, and, subsequent, kings, only, queens, victoria, and, elizabeth, ii, lived, and, reigned, longer, george, iii, was, dubbed, farmer, george, by, satirists, at, first, to, mock, his, interest, in, mundane, matters, rather, than, politics, but, later, to, portray, him, as, a, man, of, the, people, contrasting, his, homely, thrift, with, his, son, s, grandiosity, under, george, iii, the, british, agricultural, revolution, reached, its, peak, and, great, advances, were, made, in, fields, such, as, science, and, industry, there, was, unprecedented, growth, in, the, rural, population, which, in, turn, provided, much, of, the, workforce, for, the, concurrent, industrial, revolution, george, s, collection, of, mathematical, and, scientific, instruments, is, now, owned, by, king, s, college, london, but, housed, in, the, science, museum, london, to, which, it, has, been, on, long, term, loan, since, 1927, he, had, the, king, s, observatory, built, in, richmond, upon, thames, for, his, own, observations, of, the, 1769, transit, of, venus, when, william, herschel, discovered, uranus, in, 1781, he, at, first, named, it, georgium, sidus, george, s, star, after, the, king, who, later, funded, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, herschel, s, 1785, 40, foot, telescope, which, at, the, time, was, the, biggest, ever, built, george, iii, hoped, that, the, tongue, of, malice, may, not, paint, my, intentions, in, those, colours, she, admires, nor, the, sycophant, extoll, me, beyond, what, i, deserve, but, in, the, popular, mind, george, iii, has, been, both, demonised, and, praised, while, very, popular, at, the, start, of, his, reign, by, the, mid, 1770s, george, had, lost, the, loyalty, of, revolutionary, american, colonists, though, it, has, been, estimated, that, as, many, as, half, of, the, colonists, remained, loyal, the, grievances, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, were, presented, as, repeated, injuries, and, usurpations, that, he, had, committed, to, establish, an, absolute, tyranny, over, the, colonies, the, declaration, s, wording, has, contributed, to, the, american, public, s, perception, of, george, as, a, tyrant, contemporary, accounts, of, george, iii, s, life, fall, into, two, camps, one, demonstrating, attitudes, dominant, in, the, latter, part, of, the, reign, when, the, king, had, become, a, revered, symbol, of, national, resistance, to, french, ideas, and, french, power, while, the, other, derived, their, views, of, the, king, from, the, bitter, partisan, strife, of, the, first, two, decades, of, the, reign, and, they, expressed, in, their, works, the, views, of, the, opposition, building, on, the, latter, of, these, two, assessments, british, historians, of, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, such, as, trevelyan, and, erskine, may, promoted, hostile, interpretations, of, george, iii, s, life, however, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, the, work, of, lewis, namier, who, thought, george, was, much, maligned, started, a, re, evaluation, of, the, man, and, his, reign, scholars, of, the, later, twentieth, century, such, as, butterfield, and, pares, and, macalpine, and, hunter, are, inclined, to, treat, george, sympathetically, seeing, him, as, a, victim, of, circumstance, and, illness, butterfield, rejected, the, arguments, of, his, victorian, predecessors, with, withering, disdain, erskine, may, must, be, a, good, example, of, the, way, in, which, an, historian, may, fall, into, error, through, an, excess, of, brilliance, his, capacity, for, synthesis, and, his, ability, to, dovetail, the, various, parts, of, the, evidence, carried, him, into, a, more, profound, and, complicated, elaboration, of, error, than, some, of, his, more, pedestrian, predecessors, he, inserted, a, doctrinal, element, into, his, history, which, granted, his, original, aberrations, was, calculated, to, project, the, lines, of, his, error, carrying, his, work, still, further, from, centrality, or, truth, in, pursuing, war, with, the, american, colonists, george, iii, believed, he, was, defending, the, right, of, an, elected, parliament, to, levy, taxes, rather, than, seeking, to, expand, his, own, power, or, prerogatives, in, the, opinion, of, modern, scholars, during, the, long, reign, of, george, iii, the, monarchy, continued, to, lose, its, political, power, and, grew, as, the, embodiment, of, national, morality, in, great, britain, george, iii, used, the, official, style, george, the, third, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, great, britain, france, and, ireland, defender, of, the, faith, and, so, forth, in, 1801, when, great, britain, united, with, ireland, he, dropped, the, title, of, king, of, france, which, had, been, used, for, every, english, monarch, since, edward, iii, s, claim, to, the, french, throne, in, the, medieval, period, his, style, became, george, the, third, by, the, grace, of, god, of, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, king, defender, of, the, faith, in, germany, he, was, duke, of, brunswick, and, l, neburg,

of, the, empire, in, 1806, he, then, continued, as, duke, until, the, congress, of, vienna, declared, him, king, of, hanover, in, 1814, before, his, succession, george, was, granted, the, royal, arms, differenced, by, a, label, of, five, points, azure, the, centre, point, bearing, a, fleur, de, lis, or, on, 27, july, 1749, upon, his, father, s, death, and, along, with, the, dukedom, of, edinburgh, and, the, position, of, heir, apparent, he, inherited, his, difference, of, a, plain, label, of, three, points, argent, in, an, additional, difference, the, crown, of, charlemagne, was, not, usually, depicted, on, the, arms, of, the, heir, only, on, the, sovereign, s, from, his, succession, until, 1800, george, bore, the, royal, arms, quarterly, i, gules, three, lions, passant, guardant, in, pale,
