photographs, to, be, sold, for, her, benefit, to, further, aid, coolbrith, george, wharton, james, visited, twain, in, new, york, and, arranged, for, a, new, portrait, session, twain, was, resistant, initially, but, he, eventually, admitted, that, four, of, the, resulting, images, were, the, finest, ones, ever, taken, of, him, in, september, twain, started, publishing, chapters, from, his, autobiography, in, the, north, american, review, the, same, year, charlotte, teller, a, writer, living, with, her, grandmother, at, 3, fifth, avenue, began, an, acquaintanceship, with, him, which, lasted, several, years, and, may, have, included, romantic, intentions, on, his, part, in, 1906, twain, formed, the, angel, fish, and, aquarium, club, for, girls, whom, he, viewed, as, surrogate, granddaughters, its, dozen, or, so, members, ranged, in, age, from, 10, to, 16, twain, exchanged, letters, with, his, angel, fish, girls, and, invited, them, to, concerts, and, the, theatre, and, to,

he, said, in, 1909, i, came, in, with, halley, s, comet, in, 1835, it, is, coming, again, next, year, and, i, expect, to, go, out, with, it, it, will, be, the, greatest, disappointment, of, my, life, if, i, don, t, go, out, with, halley, s, comet, the, almighty, has, said, no, doubt, now, here, are, these, two, unaccountable, freaks, they, came, in, together, they, must, go, out, together, twain, s, prediction, was, eerily, accurate, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, on, april, 21, 1910, in, stormfield, one, month, before, the, comet, passed, earth, that, year, upon, hearing, of, twain, s, death, president, william, howard, taft, said, mark, twain, gave, pleasure, real, intellectual, enjoyment, to, millions, and, his, works, will, continue, to, give, such, pleasure, to, millions, yet, to, come, his, humor, was, american, but, he, was, nearly, as, much, appreciated, by, englishmen, and, people, of, other, countries, as, by, his, own, countrymen, he, has, made, an, enduring, part, of, american, literature, twain, s, funeral, was, at, the, brick, presbyterian, church, on, fifth, avenue, new, york, he, is, buried, in, his, wife, s, family, plot, at, woodlawn, cemetery, in, elmira, new, york, the, langdon, family, plot, is, marked, by, a, 12, foot, monument, two, fathoms, or, mark, twain, placed, there, by, twain, s, surviving, daughter, clara, there, is, also, a, smaller, headstone, he, expressed, a, preference, for, cremation, for, example, in, life, on, the, mississippi, but, he, acknowledged, that, his, surviving, family, would, have, the, last, word, officials, in, connecticut, and, new, york, estimated, the, value, of, twain, s, estate, at, 471, 000, 11, 000, 000, in, 2023, twain, began, his, career, writing, light, humorous, verse, but, he, became, a, chronicler, of, the, vanities, hypocrisies, and, murderous, acts, of, mankind, at, mid, career, twain, combined, rich, humor, sturdy, narrative, and, social, criticism, in, huckleberry, finn, he, was, a, master, of, rendering, colloquial, speech, and, helped, to, create, and, popularize, a, distinctive, american, literature, built, on, american, themes, and, language, many, of, twain, s, works, have, been, suppressed, at, times, for, various, reasons, the, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, has, been, repeatedly, restricted, in, american, high, schools, not, least, for, its, frequent, use, of, the, word, nigger, a, slur, commonly, used, for, black, people, in, the, nineteenth, century, a, complete, bibliography, of, twain, s, works, is, nearly, impossible, to, compile, because, of, the, vast, number, of, pieces, he, wrote, often, in, obscure, newspapers, and, his, use, of, several, different, pen, names, additionally, a, large, portion, of, twain, s, speeches, and, lectures, have, been, lost, or, were, not, recorded, thus, the, compilation, of, his, works, is, an, ongoing, process, researchers, have, rediscovered, published, material, as, recently, as, 1995, and, 2015, twain, was, writing, for, the, virginia, city, newspaper, the, territorial, enterprise, in, 1863, when, he, met, lawyer, tom, fitch, editor, of, the, competing, newspaper, virginia, daily, union, and, known, as, the, silver, tongued, orator, of, the, pacific, 51, twain, credited, fitch, with, giving, him, his, first, really, profitable, lesson, in, writing, when, i, first, began, to, lecture, and, in, my, earlier, writings, twain, later, commented, my, sole, idea, was, to, make, comic, capital, out, of, everything, i, saw, and, heard, in, 1866, he, presented, his, lecture, on, the, sandwich, islands, to, a, crowd, in, washoe, city, nevada, afterwards, fitch, told, him, clemens, your, lecture, was, magnificent, it, was, eloquent, moving, sincere, never, in, my, entire, life, have, i, listened, to, such, a, magnificent, piece, of, descriptive, narration, but, you, committed, one, unpardonable, sin, the, unpardonable, sin, it, is, a, sin, you, must, never, commit, again, you, closed, a, most, eloquent, description, by, which, you, had, keyed, your, audience, up, to, a, pitch, of, the, intensest, interest, with, a, piece, of, atrocious, anti, climax, which, nullified, all, the, really, fine, effect, you, had, produced, it, was, in, these, days, that, twain, became, a, writer, of, the, sagebrush, school, he, was, known, later, as, its, most, famous, member, twain, s, first, important, work, was, the, celebrated, jumping, frog, of, calaveras, county, published, in, the, new, york, saturday, press, on, november, 18, 1865, after, a, burst, of, popularity, the, sacramento, union, commissioned, him, to, write, letters, about, his, travel, experiences, the, first, journey, that, twain, took, for, this, job, was, to, ride, the, steamer, ajax, on, its, maiden, voyage, to, the, sandwich, islands, hawaii, all, the, while, he, was, writing, letters, to, the, newspaper, that, were, meant, for, publishing, chronicling, his, experiences, with, humor, these, letters, proved, to, be, the, genesis, to, twain, s, work, with, the, san, francisco, alta, california, newspaper, which, designated, him, a, traveling, correspondent, for, a, trip, from, san, francisco, to, new, york, city, via, the, panama, isthmus, on, june, 8, 1867, twain, set, sail, on, the, pleasure, cruiser, quaker, city, for, five, months, and, this, trip, resulted, in, the, innocents, abroad, or, the, new, pilgrims, progress, in, 1872, he, published, his, second, piece, of, travel, literature, roughing, it, as, an, account, of, his, journey, from, missouri, to, nevada, his, subsequent, life, in, the, american, west, and, his, visit, to, hawaii, the, book, lampoons, american, and, western, society, in, the, same, way, that, innocents, critiqued, the, various, countries, of, europe, and, the, middle, east, twain, s, next, work, was, the, gilded, age, a, tale, of, today, his, first, attempt, at, writing, a, novel, the, book, written, with, twain, s, neighbor, charles, dudley, warner, is, also, his, only, collaboration, twain, s, next, work, drew, on, his, experiences, on, the, mississippi, river, old, times, on, the, mississippi, was, a, series, of, sketches, published, in, the, atlantic, monthly, in, 1875, featuring, his, disillusionment, with, romanticism, old, times, eventually, became, the, starting, point, for, life, on, the, mississippi, twain, s, next, major, publication, was, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, which, draws, on, his, youth, in, hannibal, tom, sawyer, was, modeled, on, twain, as, a, child, with, traces, of, schoolmates, john, briggs, and, will, bowen, the, book, also, introduces, huckleberry, finn, in, a, supporting, role, based, on, twain, s, boyhood, friend, tom, blankenship, the, prince, and, the, pauper, was, not, as, well, received, despite, a, storyline, that, is, common, in, film, and, literature, today, the, book, tells, the, story, of, two, boys, born, on, the, same, day, who, are, physically, identical, acting, as, a, social, commentary, as, the, prince, and, pauper, switch, places, twain, had, started, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, which, he, consistently, had, problems, completing, and, had, completed, his, travel, book, a, tramp, abroad, which, describes, his, travels, through, central, and, southern, europe, twain, s, next, major, published, work, was, the, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, which, confirmed, him, as, a, noteworthy, american, writer, some, have, called, it, the, first, great, american, novel, and, the, book, has, become, required, reading, in, many, schools, throughout, the, united, states, huckleberry, finn, was, an, offshoot, from, tom, sawyer, and, had, a, more, serious, tone, than, its, predecessor, four, hundred, manuscript, pages, were, written, in, mid, 1876, right, after, the, publication, of, tom, sawyer, the, last, fifth, of, huckleberry, finn, is, subject, to, much, controversy, some, say, that, twain, experienced, a, failure, of, nerve, as, critic, leo, marx, puts, it, ernest, hemingway, once, said, of, huckleberry, finn, if, you, read, it, you, must, stop, where, the, nigger, jim, is, stolen, from, the, boys, that, is, the, real, end, the, rest, is, just, cheating, hemingway, also, wrote, in, the, same, essay, all, modern, american, literature, comes, from, one, book, by, mark, twain, called, huckleberry, finn, near, the, completion, of, huckleberry, finn, twain, wrote, life, on, the, mississippi, which, is, said, to, have, heavily, influenced, the, novel, the, travel, work, recounts, twain, s, memories, and, new, experiences, after, a, 22, year, absence, from, the, mississippi, river, in, it, he, also, explains, that, mark, twain, was, the, call, made, when, the, boat, was, in, safe, water, indicating, a, depth, of, two, or, twain, fathoms, 12, feet, or, 3, 7, metres, mcdowell, s, cave, now, known, as, mark, twain, cave, in, hannibal, missouri, and, frequently, mentioned, in, twain, s, book, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, has, sam, clemens, twain, s, real, name, engraved, on, the, wall, by, twain, himself, twain, produced, president, ulysses, s, grant, s, memoirs, through, his, fledgling, publishing, house, charles, l, webster, and, company, which, he, co, owned, with, charles, l, webster, his, nephew, by, marriage, at, this, time, twain, also, wrote, the, private, history, of, a, campaign, that, failed, for, the, century, magazine, this, piece, detailed, his, two, week, stint, in, a, confederate, militia, during, the, civil, war, twain, next, focused, on, a, connecticut, yankee, in, king, arthur, s, court, written, with, the, same, historical, fiction, style, as, the, prince, and, the, pauper, a, connecticut, yankee, showed, the, absurdities, of, political, and, social, norms, by, setting, them, in, the, court, of, king, arthur, the, book, was, started, in, december, 1885, then, shelved, a, few, months, later, until, the, summer, of, 1887, and, eventually, finished, in, the, spring, of, 1889, twain, s, next, large, scale, work, was, pudd, nhead, wilson, which, he, wrote, rapidly, as, he, was, desperately, trying, to, stave, off, bankruptcy, from, november, 12, to, december, 14, 1893, twain, wrote, 60, 000, words, for, the, novel, critics, have, pointed, to, this, rushed, completion, as, the, cause, of, the, novel, s, rough, organization, and, constant, disruption, of, the, plot, this, novel, also, contains, the, tale, of, two, boys, born, on, the, same, day, who, switch, positions, in, life, like, the, prince, and, the, pauper, it, was, first, published, serially, in, century, magazine, and, when, it, was, finally, published, in, book, form, pudd, nhead, wilson, appeared, as, the, main, title, however, the, subtitles, make, the, entire, title, read, the, tragedy, of, pudd, nhead, wilson, and, the, comedy, of, the, extraordinary, twins, twain, s, next, venture, was, a, work, of, straight, fiction, that, he, called, personal, recollections, of, joan, of, arc, and, dedicated, to, his, wife, twain, said, a, year, before, his, death, that, this, was, the, work, that, he, was, most, proud, of, despite, the, criticism, that, he, received, for, it, writing, i, like, joan, of, arc, best, of, all, my, books, and, it, is, the, best, i, know, it, perfectly, well, and, besides, it, furnished, me, seven, times, the, pleasure, afforded, me, by, any, of, the, others, twelve, years, of, preparation, and, two, years, of, writing, the, others, needed, no, preparation, and, got, none, the, book, had, been, a, dream, of, twain, s, since, childhood, and, he, claimed, that, he, had, found, a, manuscript, detailing, the, life, of, joan, of, arc, when, twain, was, an, adolescent, it, was, written, at, the, time, of, his, bankruptcy, and, twain, was, convinced, that, it, would, save, his, financial, disposition, twain, specifically, insisted, it, to, be, an, anonymous, publication, so, that, readers, would, take, it, as, a, serious, historical, account, with, the, help, of, his, financial, adviser, henry, huttleston, rogers, it, was, published, anonymously, in, serials, in, the, harper, s, magazine, in, 1895, to, pay, the, bills, and, keep, his, business, projects, afloat, twain, had, begun, to, write, articles, and, commentary, furiously, with, diminishing, returns, but, it, was, not, enough, he, filed, for, bankruptcy, in, 1894, during, this, time, of, dire, financial, straits, twain, published, several, literary, reviews, in, newspapers, to, help, make, ends, meet, he, famously, derided, james, fenimore, cooper, in, his, article, detailing, cooper, s, literary, offenses, twain, became, an, extremely, outspoken, critic, of, other, authors, and, other, critics, he, suggested, that, before, praising, cooper, s, work, thomas, lounsbury, brander, matthews, and, wilkie, collins, ought, to, have, read, some, of, it, george, eliot, jane, austen, and, robert, louis, stevenson, also, fell, under, twain, s, attack, during, this, time, period, beginning, around, 1890, and, continuing, until, his, death, twain, outlines, what, he, considers, to, be, quality, writing, in, several, letters, and, essays, in, addition, to, providing, a, source, for, the, tooth, and, claw, style, of, literary, criticism, twain, places, emphasis, on, concision, utility, of, word, choice, and, realism, he, complains, for, example, that, cooper, s, deerslayer, purports, to, be, realistic, but, has, several, shortcomings, ironically, several, of, twain, s, own, works, were, later, criticized, for, lack, of, continuity, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, and, organization, pudd, nhead, wilson, twain, s, wife, died, in, 1904, while, the, couple, were, staying, at, the, villa, di, quarto, in, florence, after, some, time, had, passed, he, published, some, works, that, his, wife, his, de, facto, editor, and, censor, throughout, her, married, life, had, looked, down, upon, the, mysterious, stranger, is, perhaps, the, best, known, depicting, various, visits, of, satan, to, earth, this, particular, work, was, not, published, in, twain, s, lifetime, his, manuscripts, included, three, versions, written, between, 1897, and, 1905, the, so, called, hannibal, eseldorf, and, print, shop, versions, the, resulting, confusion, led, to, extensive, publication, of, a, jumbled, version, and, only, recently, have, the, original, versions, become, available, as, twain, wrote, them, twain, s, last, work, was, his, autobiography, which, he, dictated, and, thought, would, be, most, entertaining, if, he, went, off, on, whims, and, tangents, in, non, chronological, order, some, archivists, and, compilers, have, rearranged, the, biography, into, a, more, conventional, form, thereby, eliminating, some, of, twain, s, humor, and, the, flow, of, the, book, the, first, volume, of, the, autobiography, over, 736, pages, was, published, by, the, university, of, california, in, november, 2010, 100, years, after, his, death, as, twain, wished, it, soon, became, an, unexpected, best, seller, making, twain, one, of, a, very, few, authors, publishing, new, best, selling, volumes, in, the, 19th, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, twain, s, works, have, been, subjected, to, censorship, efforts, according, to, stuart, 2013, leading, these, banning, campaigns, generally, were, religious, organizations, or, individuals, in, positions, of, influence, not, so, much, working, librarians, who, had, been, instilled, with, that, american, library, spirit, which, honored, intellectual, freedom, within, bounds, of, course, in, 1905, the, brooklyn, public, library, banned, both, the, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, and, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, from, the, children, s, department, because, of, their, language, for, two, decades, twain, lived, in, a, house, in, hartford, connecticut, 1871, 1891, and, the, american, publishing, company, in, that, city, published, the, first, edition, of, several, of, his, books, the, same, can, be, said, about, a, number, of, new, york, based, companies, such, as, harper, brothers, and, his, nephew, s, charles, l, webster, and, company, other, memorable, editions, were, created, by, the, ash, ranch, press, of, san, diego, and, barry, moser, s, pennyroyal, press, twain, s, views, became, more, radical, as, he, grew, older, in, a, letter, to, friend, and, fellow, writer, william, dean, howells, in, 1887, twain, acknowledged, that, his, views, had, changed, and, developed, over, his, lifetime, referring, to, one, of, his, favorite, works, when, i, finished, carlyle, s, french, revolution, in, 1871, i, was, a, girondin, every, time, i, have, read, it, since, i, have, read, it, differently, being, influenced, and, changed, little, by, little, by, life, and, environment, and, now, i, lay, the, book, down, once, more, and, recognize, that, i, am, a, sansculotte, and, not, a, pale, characterless, sansculotte, but, a, marat, twain, was, a, staunch, supporter, of, technological, progress, and, commerce, he, was, against, welfare, measures, because, twain, believed, that, society, in, the, business, age, is, governed, by, exact, and, constant, laws, that, should, not, be, interfered, with, for, the, accommodation, of, any, individual, or, political, or, religious, faction, he, opined, that, there, is, no, good, government, at, all, none, possible, in, the, opinion, of, washington, university, professor, guy, a, cardwell, by, present, standards, mark, twain, was, more, conservative, than, liberal, he, believed, strongly, in, laissez, faire, thought, personal, political, rights, secondary, to, property, rights, admired, self, made, plutocrats, and, advocated, a, leadership, to, be, composed, of, men, of, wealth, and, brains, among, his, attitudes, now, more, readily, recognized, as, liberal, were, a, faith, in, progress, through, technology, and, a, hostility, towards, monarchy, inherited, aristocracy, the, roman, catholic, church, and, in, his, later, years, imperialism, twain, wrote, glowingly, about, unions, in, the, river, boating, industry, in, life, on, the, mississippi, which, was, read, in, union, halls, decades, later, he, supported, the, labor, movement, especially, one, of, the, most, important, unions, the, knights, of, labor, in, a, speech, to, them, twain, said, who, are, the, oppressors, the, few, the, king, the, capitalist, and, a, handful, of, other, overseers, and, superintendents, who, are, the, oppressed, the, many, the, nations, of, the, earth, the, valuable, personages, the, workers, they, that, make, the, bread, that, the, soft, handed, and, idle, eat, twain, further, wrote, why, is, it, right, that, there, is, not, a, fairer, division, of, the, spoil, all, around, because, laws, and, constitutions, have, ordered, otherwise, then, it, follows, that, laws, and, constitutions, should, change, around, and, say, there, shall, be, a, more, nearly, equal, division, before, 1899, twain, was, largely, in, favor, of, imperialism, in, the, late, 1860s, and, early, 1870s, he, spoke, out, strongly, in, favor, of, american, interests, in, the, hawaiian, islands, twain, said, the, war, with, spain, in, 1898, was, the, worthiest, war, ever, fought, however, he, reversed, course, in, 1899, in, the, new, york, herald, october, 16, 1900, twain, describes, his, transformation, and, political, awakening, in, the, context, of, the, philippine, american, war, to, anti, imperialism, i, wanted, the, american, eagle, to, go, screaming, into, the, pacific, why, not, spread, its, wings, over, the, philippines, i, asked, myself, i, said, to, myself, here, are, a, people, who, have, suffered, for, three, centuries, we, can, make, them, as, free, as, ourselves, give, them, a, government, and, country, of, their, own, put, a, miniature, of, the, american, constitution, afloat, in, the, pacific, start, a, brand, new, republic, to, take, its, place, among, the, free, nations, of, the, world, it, seemed, to, me, a, great, task, to, which, we, had, addressed, ourselves, but, i, have, thought, some, more, since, then, and, i, have, read, carefully, the, treaty, of, paris, which, ended, the, spanish, american, war, and, i, have, seen, that, we, do, not, intend, to, free, but, to, subjugate, the, people, of, the, philippines, we, have, gone, there, to, conquer, not, to, redeem, it, should, it, seems, to, me, be, our, pleasure, and, duty, to, make, those, people, free, and, let, them, deal, with, their, own, domestic, questions, in, their, own, way, and, so, i, am, an, anti, imperialist, i, am, opposed, to, having, the, eagle, put, its, talons, on, any, other, land, during, the, boxer, rebellion, twain, said, that, the, boxer, is, a, patriot, he, loves, his, country, better, than, he, does, the, countries, of, other, people, i, wish, him, success, from, 1901, soon, after, his, return, from, europe, until, his, death, in, 1910, twain, was, vice, president, of, the, american, anti, imperialist, league, which, opposed, the, annexation, of, the, philippines, by, the, united, states, and, had, tens, of, thousands, of, members, he, wrote, many, political, pamphlets, for, the, organization, the, incident, in, the, philippines, posthumously, published, in, 1924, was, in, response, to, the, moro, crater, massacre, in, which, 600, moros, were, killed, twain, wrote, in, what, way, was, it, a, battle, it, has, no, resemblance, to, a, battle, we, cleaned, up, our, four, days, work, and, made, it, complete, by, butchering, these, helpless, people, many, of, his, neglected, and, previously, uncollected, writings, on, anti, imperialism, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, book, form, in, 1992, twain, was, critical, of, imperialism, in, other, countries, as, well, in, following, the, equator, twain, expresses, hatred, and, condemnation, of, imperialism, of, all, stripes, he, was, highly, critical, of, european, imperialists, such, as, cecil, rhodes, and, king, leopold, ii, of, belgium, both, of, whom, attempted, to, establish, colonies, on, the, african, continent, during, the, scramble, for, africa, king, leopold, s, soliloquy, is, a, political, satire, about, the, monarch, s, private, colony, the, congo, free, state, reports, of, outrageous, exploitation, and, grotesque, abuses, led, to, widespread, international, outcry, in, the, early, 1900s, arguably, the, first, large, scale, human, rights, movement, in, the, soliloquy, the, king, argues, that, bringing, christianity, to, the, colony, outweighs, a, little, starvation, the, abuses, against, congolese, forced, laborers, continued, until, the, movement, forced, the, belgian, government, to, take, direct, control, of, the, colony, during, the, philippine, american, war, twain, wrote, a, short, pacifist, story, titled, the, war, prayer, which, makes, the, point, that, humanism, and, christianity, s, preaching, of, love, are, incompatible, with, the, conduct, of, war, it, was, submitted, to, harper, s, bazaar, for, publication, but, on, march, 22, 1905, the, magazine, rejected, the, story, as, not, quite, suited, to, a, woman, s, magazine, eight, days, later, twain, wrote, to, his, friend, daniel, carter, beard, to, whom, he, had, read, the, story, i, don, t, think, the, prayer, will, be, published, in, my, time, none, but, the, dead, are, permitted, to, tell, the, truth, because, he, had, an, exclusive, contract, with, harper, brothers, twain, could, not, publish, the, war, prayer, elsewhere, it, remained, unpublished, until, 1916, it, was, republished, in, the, 1960s, as, campaigning, material, by, anti, war, activists, twain, acknowledged, that, he, had, originally, sympathized, with, the, more, moderate, girondins, of, the, french, revolution, and, then, shifted, his, sympathies, to, the, more, radical, sansculottes, indeed, identifying, himself, as, a, marat, and, writing, that, the, reign, of, terror, paled, in, comparison, to, the, older, terrors, that, preceded, it, twain, supported, the, revolutionaries, in, russia, against, the, reformists, arguing, that, the, tsar, must, be, got, rid, of, by, violent, means, because, peaceful, ones, would, not, work, he, summed, up, his, views, of, revolutions, in, the, following, statement, i, am, said, to, be, a, revolutionist, in, my, sympathies, by, birth, by, breeding, and, by, principle, i, am, always, on, the, side, of, the, revolutionists, because, there, never, was, a, revolution, unless, there, were, some, oppressive, and, intolerable, conditions, against, which, to, revolute, twain, was, an, adamant, supporter, of, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, the, emancipation, of, slaves, even, going, so, far, as, to, say, lincoln, s, proclamation, not, only, set, the, black, slaves, free, but, set, the, white, man, free, also, he, argued, that, non, whites, did, not, receive, justice, in, the, united, states, once, saying, i, have, seen, chinamen, abused, and, maltreated, in, all, the, mean, cowardly, ways, possible, to, the, invention, of, a, degraded, nature, but, i, never, saw, a, chinaman, righted, in, a, court, of, justice, for, wrongs, thus, done, to, him, twain, paid, for, at, least, one, black, person, to, attend, yale, law, school, and, for, another, black, person, to, attend, a, southern, university, to, become, a, minister, twain, was, also, a, supporter, of, women, s, suffrage, as, evidenced, by, his, votes, for, women, speech, given, in, 1901, helen, keller, benefited, from, twain, s, support, as, she, pursued, her, college, education, and, publishing, despite, her, disabilities, and, financial, limitations, the, two, were, friends, for, roughly, 16, years, through, twain, s, efforts, the, connecticut, legislature, voted, a, pension, for, prudence, crandall, since, 1995, connecticut, s, official, heroine, for, her, efforts, towards, the, education, of, young, african, american, women, in, connecticut, twain, also, offered, to, purchase, for, her, use, her, former, house, in, canterbury, home, of, the, canterbury, female, boarding, school, but, she, declined, 528, at, 62, twain, wrote, in, his, travelogue, following, the, equator, 1897, that, in, colonized, lands, all, over, the, world, savages, have, always, been, wronged, by, whites, in, the, most, merciless, ways, such, as, robbery, humiliation, and, slow, slow, murder, through, poverty, and, the, white, man, s, whiskey, his, conclusion, is, that, there, are, many, humorous, things, in, this, world, among, them, the, white, man, s, notion, that, he, is, less, savage, than, the, other, savages, describing, his, travels, twain, wrote, so, far, as, i, am, able, to, judge, nothing, has, been, left, undone, either, by, man, or, nature, to, make, india, the, most, extraordinary, country, that, the, sun, visits, on, his, rounds, where, every, prospect, pleases, and, only, man, is, vile, twain, s, earlier, writings, on, american, indians, reflected, his, view, of, essentialized, racial, difference, twain, wrote, in, the, noble, red, man, in, 1870, his, heart, is, a, cesspool, of, falsehood, of, treachery, and, of, low, and, devilish, instincts, with, him, gratitude, is, an, unknown, emotion, and, when, one, does, him, a, kindness, it, is, safest, to, keep, the, face, toward, him, lest, the, reward, be, an, arrow, in, the, back, to, accept, of, a, favor, from, him, is, to, assume, a, debt, which, you, can, never, repay, to, his, satisfaction, though, you, bankrupt, yourself, trying, the, scum, of, the, earth, in, the, same, tract, twain, advocates, genocide, describing, the, noble, aborigine, as, nothing, but, a, poor, filthy, naked, scurvy, vagabond, whom, to, exterminate, were, a, charity, to, the, creator, s, worthier, insects, and, reptiles, which, he, oppresses, this, piece, sought, to, undermine, the, sympathy, felt, on, the, atlantic, seabord, for, native, americans, in, 1895, twain, was, still, ridiculing, the, author, of, last, of, the, mohicans, saying, in, fenimore, cooper, s, literary, offenses, that, cooper, was, almost, always, in, error, about, his, indians, there, was, seldom, a, sane, one, among, them, twain, was, a, republican, for, most, of, his, life, however, in, 1884, twain, publicly, broke, with, his, party, and, joined, the, mugwumps, to, support, the, democratic, nominee, grover, cleveland, over, the, republican, nominee, james, g, blaine, whom, he, considered, a, corrupt, politician, twain, spoke, at, rallies, in, favor, of, cleveland, in, the, early, 20th, century, twain, began, decrying, both, democrats, and, republicans, as, insane, and, proposed, in, his, 1907, book, christian, science, that, while, each, party, recognized, the, other, s, insanity, only, the, mugwumps, that, is, those, who, eschewed, party, loyalties, in, favor, of, voting, for, the, best, man, could, perceive, the, overall, madness, linking, the, two, twain, was, a, presbyterian, he, was, critical, of, organized, religion, and, certain, elements, of, christianity, through, his, later, life, for, example, twain, wrote, faith, is, believing, what, you, know, ain, t, so, and, if, christ, were, here, now, there, is, one, thing, he, would, not, be, a, christian, with, anti, catholic, sentiment, rampant, in, 19th, century, america, twain, noted, that, he, was, educated, to, enmity, toward, everything, that, is, catholic, as, an, adult, twain, engaged, in, religious, discussions, and, attended, services, his, theology, developing, as, twain, wrestled, with, the, deaths, of, loved, ones, and, with, his, own, mortality, twain, generally, avoided, publishing, his, most, controversial, opinions, on, religion, in, his, lifetime, and, they, are, known, from, essays, and, stories, that, were, published, later, in, the, essay, three, statements, of, the, eighties, in, the, 1880s, twain, stated, that, he, believed, in, an, almighty, god, but, not, in, any, messages, revelations, holy, scriptures, such, as, the, bible, providence, or, retribution, in, the, afterlife, twain, did, state, that, the, goodness, the, justice, and, the, mercy, of, god, are, manifested, in, his, works, but, also, that, the, universe, is, governed, by, strict, and, immutable, laws, which, determine, small, matters, such, as, who, dies, in, a, pestilence, at, other, times, he, plainly, professed, a, belief, in, providence, in, some, later, writings, in, the, 1890s, twain, was, less, optimistic, about, the, goodness, of, god, observing, that, if, our, maker, is, all, powerful, for, good, or, evil, he, is, not, in, his, right, mind, at, other, times, he, conjectured, sardonically, that, perhaps, god, had, created, the, world, with, all, its, tortures, for, some, purpose, of, his, own, but, was, otherwise, indifferent, to, humanity, which, was, too, petty, and, insignificant, to, deserve, his, attention, anyway, in, 1901, twain, criticized, the, actions, of, the, missionary, dr, william, scott, ament, 1851, 1909, because, ament, and, other, missionaries, had, collected, indemnities, from, chinese, subjects, in, the, aftermath, of, the, boxer, uprising, of, 1900, twain, s, response, to, hearing, of, ament, s, methods, was, published, in, the, north, american, review, in, february, 1901, to, the, person, sitting, in, darkness, and, deals, with, examples, of, imperialism, in, china, south, africa, and, with, the, u, s, occupation, of, the, philippines, a, subsequent, article, to, my, missionary, critics, published, in, the, north, american, review, in, april, 1901, unapologetically, continues, his, attack, but, with, the, focus, shifted, from, ament, to, his, missionary, superiors, the, american, board, of, commissioners, for, foreign, missions, after, his, death, twain, s, family, suppressed, some, of, his, work, that, was, especially, irreverent, toward, conventional, religion, including, letters, from, the, earth, which, was, not, published, until, his, daughter, clara, reversed, her, position, in, 1962, in, response, to, soviet, propaganda, about, the, withholding, the, anti, religious, the, mysterious, stranger, was, published, in, 1916, little, bessie, a, story, ridiculing, christianity, was, first, published, in, the, 1972, collection, mark, twain, s, fables, of, man, twain, raised, money, to, build, a, presbyterian, church, in, nevada, in, 1864, twain, created, a, reverent, portrayal, of, joan, of, arc, a, subject, over, which, he, had, obsessed, for, forty, years, studied, for, a, dozen, years, and, spent, two, years, writing, about, in, 1900, and, again, in, 1908, twain, stated, i, like, joan, of, arc, best, of, all, my, books, it, is, the, best, those, who, knew, twain, well, late, in, life, recount, that, he, dwelt, on, the, subject, of, the, afterlife, his, daughter, clara, saying, sometimes, he, believed, death, ended, everything, but, most, of, the, time, he, felt, sure, of, a, life, beyond, twain, s, frankest, views, on, religion, appeared, in, his, final, work, autobiography, of, mark, twain, the, publication, of, which, started, in, november, 2010, 100, years, after, his, death, in, it, twain, said, there, is, one, notable, thing, about, our, christianity, bad, bloody, merciless, money, grabbing, and, predatory, as, it, is, in, our, country, particularly, and, in, all, other, christian, countries, in, a, somewhat, modified, degree, it, is, still, a, hundred, times, better, than, the, christianity, of, the, bible, with, its, prodigious, crime, the, invention, of, hell, measured, by, our, christianity, of, to, day, bad, as, it, is, hypocritical, as, it, is, empty, and, hollow, as, it, is, neither, the, deity, nor, his, son, is, a, christian, nor, qualified, for, that, moderately, high, place, ours, is, a, terrible, religion, the, fleets, of, the, world, could, swim, in, spacious, comfort, in, the, innocent, blood, it, has, spilled, twain, was, a, freemason, he, belonged, to, polar, star, lodge, no, 79, a, f, a, m, based, in, st, louis, twain, was, initiated, an, entered, apprentice, on, may, 22, 1861, passed, to, the, degree, of, fellow, craft, on, june, 12, and, raised, to, the, degree, of, master, mason, on, july, 10, twain, visited, salt, lake, city, for, two, days, and, met, there, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, they, also, gave, him, a, book, of, mormon, he, later, wrote, in, roughing, it, about, that, book, the, book, seems, to, be, merely, a, prosy, detail, of, imaginary, history, with, the, old, testament, for, a, model, followed, by, a, tedious, plagiarism, of, the, new, testament, twain, used, different, pen, names, before, deciding, on, mark, twain, he, signed, humorous, and, imaginative, sketches, as, josh, until, 1863, additionally, twain, used, the, pen, name, thomas, jefferson, snodgrass, for, a, series, of, humorous, letters, twain, maintained, that, his, primary, pen, name, came, from, his, years, working, on, mississippi, riverboats, where, two, fathoms, a, depth, indicating, water, safe, for, the, passage, of, boat, was, a, measure, on, the, sounding, line, twain, is, an, archaic, term, for, two, as, in, the, veil, of, the, temple, was, rent, in, twain, the, riverboatman, s, cry, was, mark, twain, or, more, fully, by, the, mark, twain, meaning, according, to, the, mark, two, that, is, the, water, is, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, deep, and, it, is, safe, to, pass, twain, said, that, his, famous, pen, name, was, not, entirely, his, invention, in, life, on, the, mississippi, twain, wrote, captain, isaiah, sellers, was, not, of, literary, turn, or, capacity, but, he, used, to, jot, down, brief, paragraphs, of, plain, practical, information, about, the, river, and, sign, them, mark, twain, and, give, them, to, the, new, orleans, picayune, they, related, to, the, stage, and, condition, of, the, river, and, were, accurate, and, valuable, at, the, time, that, the, telegraph, brought, the, news, of, his, death, i, was, on, the, pacific, coast, i, was, a, fresh, new, journalist, and, needed, a, nom, de, guerre, so, i, confiscated, the, ancient, mariner, s, discarded, one, and, have, done, my, best, to, make, it, remain, what, it, was, in, his, hands, a, sign, and, symbol, and, warrant, that, whatever, is, found, in, its, company, may, be, gambled, on, as, being, the, petrified, truth, how, i, have, succeeded, it, would, not, be, modest, in, me, to, say, twain, s, story, about, his, pen, name, has, been, questioned, by, some, with, the, suggestion, that, mark, twain, refers, to, a, running, bar, tab, that, twain, would, regularly, incur, while, drinking, at, john, piper, s, saloon, in, virginia, city, nevada, samuel, clemens, himself, responded, to, this, suggestion, by, saying, mark, twain, was, the, nom, de, plume, of, one, captain, isaiah, sellers, who, used, to, write, river, news, over, it, for, the, new, orleans, picayune, he, died, in, 1863, and, as, he, could, no, longer, need, that, signature, i, laid, violent, hands, upon, it, without, asking, permission, of, the, proprietor, s, remains, that, is, the, history, of, the, nom, de, plume, i, bear, in, his, autobiography, twain, writes, further, of, captain, sellers, s, use, of, mark, twain, i, was, a, cub, pilot, on, the, mississippi, river, then, and, one, day, i, wrote, a, rude, and, crude, satire, which, was, leveled, at, captain, isaiah, sellers, the, oldest, steamboat, pilot, on, the, mississippi, river, and, the, most, respected, esteemed, and, revered, for, many, years, he, had, occasionally, written, brief, paragraphs, concerning, the, river, and, the, changes, which, it, had, undergone, under, his, observation, during, fifty, years, and, had, signed, these, paragraphs, mark, twain, and, published, them, in, the, st, louis, and, new, orleans, journals, in, my, satire, i, made, rude, game, of, his, reminiscences, it, was, a, shabby, poor, performance, but, i, didn, t, know, it, and, the, pilots, didn, t, know, it, the, pilots, thought, it, was, brilliant, they, were, jealous, of, sellers, because, when, the, gray, heads, among, them, pleased, their, vanity, by, detailing, in, the, hearing, of, the, younger, craftsmen, marvels, which, they, had, seen, in, the, long, ago, on, the, river, sellers, was, always, likely, to, step, in, at, the, psychological, moment, and, snuff, them, out, with, wonders, of, his, own, which, made, their, small, marvels, look, pale, and, sick, however, i, have, told, all, about, this, in, old, times, on, the, mississippi, the, pilots, handed, my, extravagant, satire, to, a, river, reporter, and, it, was, published, in, the, new, orleans, true, delta, that, poor, old, captain, sellers, was, deeply, wounded, he, had, never, been, held, up, to, ridicule, before, he, was, sensitive, and, he, never, got, over, the, hurt, which, i, had, wantonly, and, stupidly, inflicted, upon, his, dignity, i, was, proud, of, my, performance, for, a, while, and, considered, it, quite, wonderful, but, i, have, changed, my, opinion, of, it, long, ago, sellers, never, published, another, paragraph, nor, ever, used, his, nom, de, guerre, again, while, twain, is, often, depicted, wearing, a, white, suit, modern, representations, suggesting, that, he, wore, them, throughout, his, life, are, unfounded, evidence, suggests, that, twain, began, wearing, white, suits, on, the, lecture, circuit, after, the, death, of, his, wife, in, 1904, however, there, is, also, evidence, showing, twain, wearing, a, white, suit, before, 1904, in, 1882, he, sent, a, photograph, of, himself, in, a, white, suit, to, 18, year, old, edward, w, bok, later, publisher, of, the, ladies, home, journal, with, a, handwritten, dated, note, the, white, suit, did, eventually, become, twain, s, trademark, as, illustrated, in, anecdotes, about, this, eccentricity, such, as, the, time, he, wore, a, white, summer, suit, to, a, congressional, hearing, during, the, winter, mcmasters, the, mark, twain, encyclopedia, states, that, twain, did, not, wear, a, white, suit, in, his, last, three, years, except, at, one, banquet, speech, in, his, autobiography, twain, writes, of, his, early, experiments, with, wearing, white, out, of, season, next, after, fine, colors, i, like, plain, white, one, of, my, sorrows, when, the, summer, ends, is, that, i, must, put, off, my, cheery, and, comfortable, white, clothes, and, enter, for, the, winter, into, the, depressing, captivity, of, the, shapeless, and, degrading, black, ones, it, is, mid, october, now, and, the, weather, is, growing, cold, up, here, in, the, new, hampshire, hills, but, it, will, not, succeed, in, freezing, me, out, of, these, white, garments, for, here, the, neighbors, are, few, and, it, is, only, of, crowds, that, i, am, afraid
