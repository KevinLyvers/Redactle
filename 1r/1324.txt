a, much, larger, ottoman, force, to, re, occupy, egypt, following, a, brief, french, occupation, that, upended, mamluk, dominance, in, egypt, the, expedition, aboard, xebecs, landed, at, aboukir, in, the, spring, of, 1801, one, of, his, trusted, army, commanders, was, miralay, mustafa, bey, who, had, married, muhammad, s, sister, zubayda, and, was, the, ancestor, of, the, yeghen, family, the, french, withdrawal, left, a, power, vacuum, in, egypt, mamluk, power, had, been, weakened, but, not, destroyed, and, ottoman, forces, clashed, with, the, mamluks, for, power, during, this, period, of, turmoil, muhammad, ali, used, his, loyal, albanian, troops, to, work, with, both, sides, gaining, power, and, prestige, for, himself, as, the, conflict, drew, on, the, local, populace, grew, weary, of, the, power, struggle, in, 1801, he, allied, with, the, egyptian, leader, umar, makram, and, egypt, s, grand, imam, of, al, azhar, during, the, infighting, between, the, ottomans, and, mamluks, between, 1801, and, 1805, muhammad, ali, carefully, acted, to, gain, the, support, of, the, general, public, in, 1805, a, group, of, prominent, egyptians, led, by, the, ulama, scholars, savants, demanded, the, replacement, of, w, li, governor, ahmad, khurshid, pasha, by, muhammad, ali, and, the, ottomans, yielded, in, 1809, though, ali, exiled, makram, to, damietta, according, to, abd, al, rahman, al, jabarti, makram, had, discovered, muhammad, ali, s, intentions, to, seize, power, for, himself, sultan, selim, iii, could, not, oppose, muhammad, ali, s, ascension, by, appearing, as, the, champion, of, the, people, muhammad, ali, was, able, to, forestall, popular, opposition, until, he, had, consolidated, his, power, the, mamluks, still, posed, the, greatest, threat, to, muhammad, ali, they, controlled, egypt, for, more, than, 600, years, and, over, that, time, they, extended, their, rule, systematically, south, along, the, nile, river, to, upper, egypt, muhammad, ali, s, approach, was, to, eliminate, the, mamluk, leadership, then, move, against, the, rank, and, file, muhammad, ali, invited, the, mamluk, leaders, to, a, celebration, at, the, cairo, citadel, in, honour, of, his, son, tusun, pasha, who, was, to, lead, a, military, expedition, into, arabia, the, event, was, held, on, 1, march, 1811, when, the, mamluks, had, gathered, at, the, citadel, they, were, surrounded, and, killed, by, muhammad, ali, s, troops, after, the, leaders, were, killed, muhammad, ali, dispatched, his, army, throughout, egypt, to, rout, the, remainder, of, the, mamluk, forces, muhammad, ali, transformed, egypt, into, a, regional, power, which, he, saw, as, the, natural, successor, to, the, decaying, ottoman, empire, he, summed, up, his, vision, for, egypt, as, follows, i, am, well, aware, that, the, ottoman, empire, is, heading, by, the, day, toward, destruction, on, its, ruins, i, will, build, a, vast, kingdom, up, to, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, sultan, selim, iii, reigned, 1789, 1807, had, recognized, the, need, to, reform, and, modernize, the, ottoman, military, along, european, lines, to, ensure, that, his, state, could, compete, selim, iii, however, faced, stiff, local, opposition, from, an, entrenched, clergy, and, military, apparatus, especially, from, the, janissaries, consequently, he, was, deposed, and, ultimately, killed, in, 1808, muhammad, ali, shared, some, traits, with, common, warlords, seeking, to, gain, the, upper, hand, at, the, expense, of, the, weakened, imperial, power, but, scholars, have, noted, that, muhammad, ali, s, rule, was, the, first, significant, program, of, europeanization, of, the, military, and, its, supporting, institutions, unlike, selim, he, had, dispatched, his, chief, rivals, giving, him, a, free, hand, to, attempt, reforms, similar, to, those, first, begun, by, selim, iii, muhammad, ali, s, goal, was, for, egypt, to, leave, the, ottoman, empire, and, be, ruled, by, his, own, hereditary, dynasty, to, do, that, he, had, to, reorganize, egyptian, society, streamline, the, economy, train, a, professional, bureaucracy, and, build, a, modern, military, his, first, task, was, to, secure, a, revenue, stream, for, egypt, to, accomplish, this, muhammad, ali, nationalized, all, the, iltizam, lands, of, egypt, thereby, officially, owning, all, the, production, of, the, land, he, accomplished, the, state, annexation, of, property, by, raising, taxes, on, the, tax, farmers, who, had, previously, owned, the, land, throughout, egypt, the, new, taxes, were, intentionally, high, and, when, the, tax, farmers, could, not, extract, the, demanded, payments, from, the, peasants, who, worked, the, land, muhammad, ali, confiscated, their, properties, the, other, major, source, of, revenue, muhammad, ali, created, was, a, new, tax, on, waqf, endowments, which, were, previously, tax, free, through, these, endowments, personal, income, could, be, set, aside, for, schools, or, other, charitable, purposes, as, well, as, raising, revenue, to, fund, his, new, military, this, tax, took, revenue, away, from, the, local, elite, mamluks, and, the, ulama, weakening, opposition, to, muhammad, ali, s, reforms, in, practice, muhammad, ali, s, land, reform, amounted, to, a, monopoly, on, trade, in, egypt, he, required, all, producers, to, sell, their, goods, to, the, state, the, state, in, turn, resold, egyptian, goods, within, egypt, and, to, foreign, markets, and, retained, the, surplus, the, practice, proved, very, profitable, for, egypt, with, the, cultivation, of, long, staple, cotton, a, new, cash, crop, to, help, improve, production, he, expanded, the, land, used, for, agriculture, and, overhauled, the, irrigation, system, largely, completed, by, the, corv, e, or, forced, peasant, labor, the, new, found, profits, also, extended, down, to, the, individual, farmers, as, the, average, wage, increased, fourfold, in, addition, to, bolstering, the, agricultural, sector, muhammad, ali, built, an, industrial, base, for, egypt, his, motivation, for, doing, so, was, primarily, an, effort, to, build, a, modern, military, consequently, he, focused, on, weapons, production, factories, based, in, cairo, produced, muskets, and, cannons, with, a, shipyard, he, built, in, alexandria, he, began, construction, of, a, navy, by, the, end, of, the, 1830s, egypt, s, war, industries, had, constructed, nine, 100, gun, warships, and, were, turning, out, 1, 600, muskets, a, month, however, the, industrial, innovations, were, not, limited, to, weapons, production, muhammad, ali, established, a, textile, industry, in, an, effort, to, compete, with, european, industries, and, produce, greater, revenues, for, egypt, while, the, textile, industry, was, not, successful, the, entire, endeavour, employed, tens, of, thousands, of, egyptians, muhammad, ali, used, contracts, called, concessions, to, build, cheap, infrastructure, dams, and, railroads, whereby, foreign, european, companies, would, raise, capital, build, projects, and, collect, most, of, the, operating, revenue, but, would, provide, ali, s, government, with, a, portion, of, that, revenue, ali, also, granted, barth, lemy, prosper, enfantin, permission, to, build, technical, schools, modeled, after, the, ecole, polytechnique, additionally, by, hiring, european, managers, he, was, able, to, introduce, industrial, training, to, the, egyptian, population, to, staff, his, new, industries, muhammad, ali, employed, a, corv, e, labor, system, the, peasantry, objected, to, these, conscriptions, and, many, ran, away, from, their, villages, to, avoid, being, taken, sometimes, fleeing, as, far, away, as, syria, a, number, of, them, maimed, themselves, so, as, to, be, unsuitable, for, combat, common, ways, of, self, maiming, were, blinding, an, eye, with, rat, poison, and, cutting, off, a, finger, of, the, right, hand, so, as, to, be, unable, to, fire, a, rifle, beyond, building, a, functioning, industrial, economy, muhammad, ali, also, made, an, effort, to, train, a, professional, military, and, bureaucracy, he, sent, promising, citizens, to, europe, to, study, again, the, driving, impulse, behind, the, effort, was, to, build, a, european, style, army, students, were, sent, to, study, european, languages, primarily, french, so, they, could, in, turn, translate, military, manuals, into, arabic, he, then, used, both, educated, egyptians, and, imported, european, experts, to, establish, schools, and, hospitals, in, egypt, european, education, also, provided, talented, egyptians, with, a, means, of, social, mobility, a, by, product, of, muhammad, ali, s, training, program, was, the, establishment, of, a, professional, bureaucracy, establishing, an, efficient, central, bureaucracy, was, an, essential, prerequisite, for, the, success, of, muhammad, ali, s, other, reforms, in, the, process, of, destroying, the, mamluks, the, w, li, had, to, fill, the, governmental, roles, that, the, mamluks, had, previously, filled, in, doing, so, muhammad, ali, kept, all, central, authority, for, himself, he, partitioned, egypt, into, ten, provinces, responsible, for, collecting, taxes, and, maintaining, order, muhammad, ali, installed, his, sons, in, most, key, positions, however, his, reforms, did, offer, egyptians, opportunities, beyond, agriculture, and, industry, a, 2015, study, found, that, ali, s, economic, policies, had, a, positive, impact, on, industrialization, in, egypt, the, purpose, of, the, law, was, to, represent, muhammad, ali, in, his, absence, muhammad, ali, s, initial, focus, was, on, reforming, the, criminal, law, passing, his, first, penal, legislation, in, 1829, by, this, time, muhammad, ali, was, already, moving, towards, an, establishment, of, an, independent, state, which, he, first, expressed, in, 1830, by, creating, a, state, of, law, and, order, where, christians, within, egypt, can, be, safe, which, was, a, way, muhammad, ali, was, able, to, pull, influence, from, europe, he, started, gradually, reforming, the, government, in, a, way, that, increased, his, influence, and, reduced, that, of, the, sultan, he, implemented, a, police, force, principally, in, cairo, and, alexandria, that, combined, public, order, and, prosecutorial, functions, strict, shari, a, rules, of, evidence, were, relaxed, and, modern, evidence, particularly, autopsy, reports, became, increasingly, important, in, investigations, and, trials, in, 1832, muhammad, ali, allowed, antoine, clot, known, as, clot, bey, in, egypt, to, establish, a, school, of, medicine, for, women, clot, bey, had, been, invited, in, 1827, by, muhammad, ali, to, found, the, qasral, ayni, school, of, medicine, at, the, army, hospital, of, abou, zabel, which, later, transferred, to, cairo, the, army, medical, school, had, a, difficult, beginning, with, religious, officials, against, dissection, of, corpses, for, anatomy, lessons, the, medical, school, for, women, would, produce, hakimas, doctoress, to, treat, women, and, children, french, women, adherents, of, the, saint, simonian, social, reform, movement, were, living, in, egypt, during, 1833, 36, and, studied, or, provided, medical, care, under, clot, bey, s, direction, french, sage, femme, midwife, suzanne, voilquin, writes, of, assisting, during, the, cholera, epidemic, of, 1834, several, of, the, french, women, contracted, cholera, and, died, ali, s, military, and, economic, goals, required, a, healthy, army, and, population, from, which, young, boys, could, be, conscripted, venereal, diseases, especially, syphilis, were, common, among, soldiers, and, smallpox, outbreaks, led, to, high, childhood, mortality, rates, clot, bey, argued, that, female, provided, health, care, for, women, and, children, was, crucial, to, maintain, a, healthy, population, he, believed, that, the, untrained, local, dayas, midwives, were, unable, to, provide, appropriate, care, and, under, egyptian, law, male, doctors, could, not, treat, women, clot, bey, s, solution, was, a, school, to, train, female, doctors, the, school, of, medicine, for, women, followed, a, french, model, the, first, two, years, of, training, provided, arabic, literacy, in, order, to, communicate, with, patients, the, following, four, included, training, in, obstetrics, pre, and, post, natal, care, dressing, wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application, of, leeches, identification, preparation, of, common, medicines, students, were, provided, housing, food, clothes, and, a, monthly, allowance, from, the, state, graduates, served, at, the, civil, hospital, in, cairo, or, at, health, centres, throughout, egypt, some, stayed, at, the, school, to, serve, as, instructors, marriages, were, arranged, by, the, state, to, male, doctors, once, married, hakimas, were, given, the, title, of, effendi, the, rank, of, second, lieutenant, and, a, monthly, salary, of, 250, piasters, licensed, hakimas, treated, women, and, children, providing, vaccinations, and, delivering, children, they, served, a, fundamental, role, in, reducing, the, incidence, of, smallpox, during, the, 19th, century, by, vaccinating, approximately, 600, children, a, month, in, the, civil, hospital, they, checked, and, treated, women, mainly, prostitutes, for, venereal, diseases, another, important, task, was, the, forensic, examination, of, women, in, this, respect, hakimas, operated, in, a, legal, setting, their, examination, was, used, as, evidence, in, cases, involving, unnatural, death, suspected, premarital, loss, of, virginity, or, miscarriage, although, one, task, of, the, hakimas, was, overseeing, childbirth, the, majority, of, the, population, continued, to, use, the, dayas, hakimas, performed, almost, no, deliveries, and, often, were, only, called, upon, during, difficult, deliveries, however, dayas, were, required, to, have, a, certificate, to, perform, deliveries, which, could, only, be, obtained, from, hakimas, they, were, also, expected, to, report, statistics, on, births, to, the, hakimas, a, significant, issue, was, recruitment, of, students, egyptian, culture, at, the, time, opposed, the, education, of, women, therefore, the, first, students, at, the, medical, school, were, young, slave, girls, slaves, continued, to, be, recruited, through, slave, auctions, as, well, as, orphans, from, hospices, despite, the, modest, success, of, the, school, and, its, graduates, increasing, enrolment, remained, a, consistent, problem, though, the, limit, of, 60, students, was, reached, in, 1846, contemporary, and, modern, historians, have, viewed, the, creation, of, a, school, of, medicine, for, women, and, the, position, of, hakima, as, an, example, of, modernization, and, reform, for, women, under, muhammad, ali, khaled, fahmy, argues, against, this, view, fahmy, states, that, because, the, reasons, for, the, creation, of, the, school, are, primarily, for, the, maintenance, of, a, healthy, army, the, school, was, not, a, sign, of, reform, but, ali, furthering, his, military, goals, for, example, their, treatment, of, venereal, diseases, was, intended, to, curb, its, incidence, among, soldiers, and, smallpox, vaccinations, increased, the, pool, of, potential, soldiers, by, reducing, childhood, mortality, rate, furthermore, the, hakimas, allowed, for, increased, state, control, over, social, life, this, is, observed, in, the, use, of, hakimas, to, collect, statistics, on, childbirth, either, personally, or, through, dayas, as, well, as, in, the, cases, where, a, hakima, was, used, to, examine, a, woman, in, the, 1820s, muhammad, ali, sent, the, first, educational, mission, of, egyptian, students, to, europe, this, contact, resulted, in, literature, that, is, considered, the, dawn, of, the, arabic, literary, renaissance, known, as, the, nahda, to, support, the, modernization, of, industry, and, the, military, muhammad, ali, set, up, a, number, of, schools, in, various, fields, where, french, texts, were, studied, rifa, a, al, tahtawi, supervised, translations, from, french, to, arabic, on, topics, ranging, from, sociology, and, history, to, military, technology, in, 1819, 21, his, government, founded, the, first, indigenous, press, in, the, arab, world, the, bulaq, press, the, bulaq, press, published, the, official, gazette, of, muhammad, ali, s, government, among, his, personal, interests, was, the, accumulation, and, breeding, of, arabian, horses, in, horses, obtained, as, taxes, and, tribute, muhammad, ali, recognized, the, unique, characteristics, and, careful, attention, to, bloodlines, of, the, horses, bred, by, the, bedouin, particularly, by, the, anazeh, in, syria, and, those, bred, in, the, nejd, while, his, immediate, successor, had, minimal, interest, in, the, horse, breeding, program, his, grandson, who, became, abbas, i, shared, this, interest, and, further, built, upon, his, work, though, muhammad, ali, s, chief, aim, was, to, establish, a, european, style, military, and, carve, out, a, personal, empire, he, waged, war, initially, on, behalf, of, the, ottoman, sultan, mahmud, ii, in, arabia, and, greece, although, he, later, came, into, open, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, he, used, several, new, strategies, to, ensure, the, success, of, his, new, military, first, new, recruits, were, isolated, from, the, environment, they, were, used, to, they, began, housing, soldiers, in, barracks, leadership, enforced, a, strict, regime, of, surveillance, roll, call, was, done, several, times, a, day, and, corporal, punishment, used, to, ensure, the, new, fighting, force, grew, to, become, a, strong, disciplined, military, the, army, often, used, the, bastinado, and, the, whip, to, control, and, punish, the, soldiers, muhammad, not, only, wanted, his, soldiers, to, be, disciplined, but, he, also, created, many, military, codes, to, regulate, the, definitions, of, crime, and, punishment, this, helped, to, create, blind, obedience, to, the, laws, a, large, part, of, ali, s, goal, of, a, european, style, military, was, through, the, creation, of, new, labelling, and, organizational, systems, to, identify, soldiers, distinguish, officers, from, enlisted, men, structure, units, and, properly, distribute, salaries, soldiers, were, given, a, unique, number, that, identified, their, unit, and, their, role, within, it, and, officers, were, expected, to, use, lists, with, these, numbers, to, keep, a, close, watch, on, the, men, and, ensure, every, man, performed, his, clearly, assigned, duty, this, was, particularly, useful, in, identifying, deserters, who, often, fled, in, the, chaos, of, massed, movement, such, as, during, forced, marches, or, relocation, to, a, new, encampment, the, soldiers, were, placed, under, strict, surveillance, in, the, barracks, in, order, to, accomplish, this, muhammad, ali, relied, on, the, bedouins, to, guard, the, troops, that, were, sent, to, the, training, camps, despite, being, hired, to, control, the, troops, the, bedouins, were, actually, a, menace, to, the, government, who, often, had, to, use, the, army, to, control, the, bedouins, in, order, to, combat, this, the, government, slowly, switched, from, using, bedouins, to, guard, the, soldiers, and, to, capture, deserters, and, instead, attempted, to, set, up, the, expectation, of, internment, from, the, beginning, of, the, soldiers, stay, at, the, training, camps, in, order, to, deter, them, from, deserting, the, military, in, the, first, place, muhammad, ali, s, first, military, campaign, was, an, expedition, into, the, arabian, peninsula, the, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, had, been, captured, by, the, house, of, saud, who, had, recently, embraced, a, literalist, hanbali, interpretation, of, islam, armed, with, their, newfound, religious, zeal, the, saudis, began, conquering, parts, of, arabia, this, culminated, in, the, capture, of, the, hejaz, region, by, 1805, with, the, main, ottoman, army, tied, up, in, europe, mahmud, ii, turned, to, muhammad, ali, to, recapture, the, arabian, territories, muhammad, ali, in, turn, appointed, his, son, tusun, to, lead, a, military, expedition, in, 1811, the, campaign, was, initially, turned, back, in, arabia, however, a, second, attack, was, launched, in, 1812, that, succeeded, in, recapturing, hejaz, while, the, campaign, was, successful, the, power, of, the, saudis, was, not, broken, they, continued, to, harass, ottoman, and, egyptian, forces, from, the, central, nejd, region, of, the, peninsula, consequently, muhammad, ali, dispatched, another, of, his, sons, ibrahim, at, the, head, of, another, army, to, finally, rout, the, saudis, after, a, two, year, campaign, the, saudis, were, crushed, and, most, of, the, saudi, family, was, captured, the, family, leader, abdullah, ibn, saud, was, sent, to, istanbul, and, executed, muhammad, ali, next, turned, his, attention, to, military, campaigns, independent, of, the, porte, beginning, with, the, sudan, which, he, viewed, as, a, valuable, additional, resource, of, territory, gold, and, slaves, the, sudan, at, the, time, had, no, real, central, authority, as, since, the, 18th, century, many, petty, kingdoms, and, tribal, sheikhdoms, had, seceded, from, the, declining, sultanate, of, sennar, fighting, each, other, with, medieval, weaponry, in, 1820, muhammad, ali, dispatched, an, army, of, 5, 000, troops, commanded, by, his, third, son, ismail, and, abidin, bey, south, into, sudan, with, the, intent, of, conquering, the, territory, and, subjugating, it, to, his, authority, ali, s, troops, made, headway, into, sudan, in, 1821, but, met, with, fierce, resistance, by, the, shaigiya, ultimately, the, superiority, of, the, egyptian, troops, and, firearms, ensured, the, defeat, of, the, shaigiya, and, the, subsequent, conquest, of, the, sudan, ali, now, had, an, outpost, from, which, he, could, expand, to, the, source, of, the, nile, in, ethiopia, and, uganda, his, administration, captured, slaves, from, the, nuba, mountains, and, west, and, south, sudan, all, incorporated, into, a, foot, regiment, known, as, the, gihadiya, pronounced, jihadiya, in, non, egyptian, arabic, which, were, composed, of, the, recently, defeated, shaigiya, who, now, took, service, under, the, invaders, in, exchange, for, keeping, their, domains, ali, s, reign, in, sudan, and, that, of, his, immediate, successors, is, remembered, in, sudan, as, brutal, and, heavy, handed, contributing, to, the, popular, independence, struggle, of, the, self, proclaimed, mahdi, muhammad, ahmad, in, 1881, while, muhammad, ali, was, expanding, his, authority, into, africa, the, ottoman, empire, was, being, challenged, by, ethnic, rebellions, in, its, european, territories, the, rebellion, in, the, greek, provinces, of, the, ottoman, empire, began, in, 1821, the, ottoman, army, proved, ineffectual, in, its, attempts, to, put, down, the, revolt, as, ethnic, violence, spread, as, far, as, constantinople, with, his, own, army, proving, ineffective, sultan, mahmud, ii, offered, muhammad, ali, the, island, of, crete, in, exchange, for, his, support, in, putting, down, the, revolt, muhammad, ali, sent, 16, 000, soldiers, 100, transports, and, 63, escort, vessels, under, command, of, his, son, ibrahim, pasha, after, ibrahim, sustained, successive, defeats, in, greece, see, ottoman, egyptian, invasion, of, mani, britain, france, and, russia, intervened, to, aid, the, greek, revolution, as, a, check, on, ibrahim, s, expansionist, agenda, which, threatened, the, balance, of, power, in, the, east, mediterranean, on, 20, october, 1827, at, the, battle, of, navarino, while, under, the, command, of, muharram, bey, the, ottoman, representative, the, entire, egyptian, navy, was, sunk, by, the, european, allied, fleet, under, the, command, of, admiral, edward, codrington, if, the, porte, was, not, in, the, least, prepared, for, this, confrontation, muhammad, ali, was, even, less, prepared, for, the, loss, of, his, highly, competent, expensively, assembled, and, maintained, navy, with, its, fleet, essentially, destroyed, egypt, had, no, way, to, support, its, forces, in, greece, and, was, forced, to, withdraw, ultimately, the, campaign, cost, muhammad, ali, his, navy, and, yielded, no, tangible, gains, in, compensation, for, his, loss, at, navarino, muhammad, ali, asked, the, porte, for, the, territory, of, syria, the, ottomans, were, indifferent, to, the, request, the, sultan, himself, asked, blandly, what, would, happen, if, syria, was, given, over, and, muhammad, ali, later, deposed, but, muhammad, ali, was, no, longer, willing, to, tolerate, ottoman, indifference, to, compensate, for, his, and, egypt, s, losses, the, wheels, for, the, conquest, of, syria, were, set, in, motion, like, other, rulers, of, egypt, before, him, ali, desired, to, control, bilad, al, sham, the, levant, both, for, its, strategic, value, and, for, its, rich, natural, resources, nor, was, this, a, sudden, vindictive, decision, on, the, part, of, ali, since, he, had, harboured, this, goal, since, his, early, years, as, egypt, s, unofficial, ruler, for, not, only, had, syria, abundant, natural, resources, it, also, had, a, thriving, international, trading, community, with, well, developed, markets, throughout, the, levant, in, addition, it, would, be, a, captive, market, for, the, goods, now, being, produced, in, egypt, yet, perhaps, most, of, all, syria, was, desirable, as, a, buffer, state, between, egypt, and, the, ottoman, sultan, a, new, fleet, was, built, a, new, army, was, raised, and, on, 31, october, 1831, under, ibrahim, pasha, the, egyptian, invasion, of, syria, initiated, the, first, turko, egyptian, war, for, the, sake, of, appearance, on, the, world, stage, a, pretext, for, the, invasion, was, vital, ultimately, the, excuse, for, the, expedition, was, a, quarrel, with, abdullah, pasha, of, acre, the, w, li, alleged, that, 6, 000, fellahin, had, fled, to, acre, to, escape, the, draft, corv, e, and, taxes, and, he, wanted, them, back, see, also, 1834, arab, revolt, in, palestine, the, egyptians, overran, most, of, syria, and, its, hinterland, with, ease, the, strongest, and, only, really, significant, resistance, was, put, up, at, the, port, city, of, acre, the, egyptian, force, eventually, captured, the, city, after, a, six, month, siege, which, lasted, from, 3, november, 1831, to, 27, may, 1832, unrest, on, the, egyptian, home, front, increased, dramatically, during, the, course, of, the, siege, ali, was, forced, to, squeeze, egypt, more, and, more, in, order, to, support, his, campaign, and, his, people, resented, the, increased, burden, after, the, fall, of, acre, the, egyptian, army, marched, north, into, anatolia, at, the, battle, of, konya, 21, december, 1832, ibrahim, pasha, soundly, defeated, the, ottoman, army, led, by, the, sadr, azam, grand, vizier, reshid, pasha, there, were, now, no, military, obstacles, between, ibrahim, s, forces, and, constantinople, itself, through, the, course, of, the, campaign, muhammad, ali, paid, particular, focus, to, the, european, powers, fearing, another, intervention, that, would, reverse, all, his, gains, he, proceeded, slowly, and, cautiously, for, example, muhammad, ali, continued, the, practice, of, using, the, sultan, s, name, at, friday, prayers, in, the, newly, captured, territories, and, continued, to, circulate, ottoman, coins, instead, of, issuing, new, ones, bearing, his, likeness, so, long, as, muhammad, ali, s, march, did, not, threaten, to, cause, the, complete, collapse, of, the, ottoman, state, the, powers, in, europe, remained, as, passive, observers, despite, this, show, muhammad, ali, s, goal, was, now, to, remove, the, current, ottoman, sultan, mahmud, ii, and, replace, him, with, the, sultan, s, son, the, infant, abd, lmecid, this, possibility, so, alarmed, mahmud, ii, that, he, accepted, russia, s, offer, of, military, aid, resulting, in, the, treaty, of, h, nk, r, skelesi, russia, s, gain, dismayed, the, british, and, french, governments, resulting, in, their, direct, intervention, from, this, position, the, european, powers, brokered, a, negotiated, solution, in, may, 1833, known, as, the, convention, of, kutahya, the, terms, of, the, peace, were, that, ali, would, withdraw, his, forces, from, anatolia, and, receive, the, territories, of, crete, then, known, as, candia, and, the, hijaz, as, compensation, and, ibrahim, pasha, would, be, appointed, w, li, of, syria, the, peace, agreement, fell, short, however, of, granting, muhammad, ali, an, independent, kingdom, for, himself, leaving, him, wanting, sensing, that, muhammad, ali, was, not, content, with, his, gains, the, sultan, attempted, to, pre, empt, further, action, against, the, ottoman, empire, by, offering, him, hereditary, rule, in, egypt, and, arabia, if, he, withdrew, from, syria, and, crete, and, renounced, any, desire, for, full, independence, muhammad, ali, rejected, the, offer, knowing, that, mahmud, could, not, force, the, egyptian, presence, from, syria, and, crete, on, 25, may, 1838, muhammad, ali, informed, britain, and, france, that, he, intended, to, declare, independence, from, the, ottoman, empire, this, action, was, contrary, to, the, desire, of, the, european, powers, to, maintain, the, status, quo, within, the, ottoman, empire, with, muhammad, ali, s, intentions, clear, the, european, powers, particularly, russia, attempted, to, moderate, the, situation, and, prevent, conflict, within, the, empire, however, both, sides, were, gearing, for, war, ibrahim, already, had, a, sizable, force, in, syria, in, constantinople, the, ottoman, commander, hafiz, pasha, assured, the, sultan, that, he, could, defeat, the, egyptian, army, when, mahmud, ii, ordered, his, forces, to, advance, on, the, syrian, frontier, ibrahim, attacked, and, destroyed, them, at, the, battle, of, nezib, 24, june, 1839, near, urfa, in, an, echo, of, the, battle, of, konya, constantinople, was, again, left, vulnerable, to, ali, s, forces, a, further, blow, to, the, ottomans, was, the, defection, of, their, fleet, to, muhammad, ali, mahmud, ii, died, almost, immediately, after, the, battle, took, place, and, was, succeeded, by, sixteen, year, old, abd, lmecid, at, this, point, ali, and, ibrahim, began, to, argue, about, which, course, to, follow, ibrahim, favoured, conquering, the, ottoman, capital, and, demanding, the, imperial, seat, while, muhammad, ali, was, inclined, simply, to, demand, numerous, concessions, of, territory, and, political, autonomy, for, himself, and, his, family, at, this, point, the, european, powers, again, intervened, see, oriental, crisis, of, 1840, on, 15, july, 1840, the, british, government, which, had, negotiated, with, austria, prussia, and, russia, to, sign, the, convention, of, london, offered, muhammad, ali, hereditary, rule, of, egypt, as, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, if, he, withdrew, from, the, syrian, hinterland, and, the, coastal, regions, of, mount, lebanon, muhammad, ali, hesitated, believing, he, had, support, from, france, his, hesitation, proved, costly, france, eventually, backed, down, as, king, louis, philippe, did, not, want, his, country, to, find, itself, involved, and, isolated, in, a, war, against, the, other, powers, especially, at, a, time, when, he, also, had, to, deal, with, the, rhine, crisis, british, naval, forces, were, ordered, to, sail, to, syria, and, alexandria, in, the, face, of, such, displays, of, european, military, might, muhammad, ali, acquiesced, after, the, british, and, austrian, navies, established, a, naval, blockade, over, the, nile, delta, coastline, and, launched, an, attack, on, egyptian, controlled, acre, muhammad, ali, agreed, to, the, terms, of, the, convention, on, 27, november, 1840, these, terms, included, renouncing, his, claims, over, crete, and, hijaz, downsizing, his, navy, and, reducing, his, standing, army, to, 18, 000, men, provided, that, he, and, his, descendants, would, enjoy, hereditary, rule, over, egypt, and, sudan, an, unheard, of, status, for, an, ottoman, governor, after, 1843, fast, on, the, heels, of, the, syrian, debacle, and, the, treaty, of, balta, liman, which, forced, the, egyptian, government, to, tear, down, its, import, barriers, and, to, give, up, its, monopolies, muhammad, ali, s, mind, became, increasingly, clouded, and, tended, towards, paranoia, whether, it, was, genuine, senility, or, the, effects, of, the, silver, nitrate, he, had, been, given, years, before, to, treat, an, attack, of, dysentery, remains, a, subject, of, debate, in, 1844, the, tax, receipts, were, in, and, sherif, pasha, the, head, of, the, diwan, al, maliyya, financial, ministry, was, too, fearful, for, his, life, to, tell, ali, the, news, that, egyptian, debt, now, stood, at, 80, million, francs, 2, 400, 000, tax, arrears, came, to, 14, 081, 500, piastres, out, of, a, total, estimated, tax, of, 75, 227, 500, pts, timidly, he, approached, ibrahim, pasha, with, these, facts, and, together, came, up, with, a, report, and, a, plan, anticipating, his, father, s, initial, reaction, ibrahim, arranged, for, muhammad, ali, s, favourite, daughter, to, break, the, news, it, did, little, if, any, good, the, resulting, rage, was, far, beyond, what, had, been, expected, and, it, took, six, full, days, for, a, tenuous, peace, to, take, hold, in, 1846, while, ibrahim, progressively, crippled, by, rheumatic, pains, and, tuberculosis, he, was, beginning, to, cough, up, blood, was, sent, to, italy, to, take, the, waters, muhammad, ali, travelled, to, constantinople, there, he, approached, the, sultan, expressed, his, fears, and, made, his, peace, explaining, ibrahim, is, old, and, sick, abbas, is, indolent, happa, and, then, children, will, rule, egypt, how, will, they, keep, egypt, after, he, secured, hereditary, rule, for, his, family, the, w, li, ruled, until, 1848, when, senility, made, further, governance, by, him, impossible, it, soon, came, to, the, point, where, his, son, and, heir, the, mortally, ailing, ibrahim, had, no, choice, but, to, travel, to, constantinople, and, request, that, the, sultan, recognize, him, ruler, of, egypt, and, sudan, even, though, his, father, was, still, alive, however, on, the, ship, returning, home, ibrahim, gripped, by, fever, and, guilt, succumbed, to, seizures, and, hallucinations, he, survived, the, journey, but, within, six, months, was, dead, he, was, succeeded, by, his, nephew, tosun, s, son, abbas, i, by, this, time, muhammad, ali, had, become, so, ill, and, senile, that, he, was, not, informed, of, his, son, s, death, lingering, a, few, months, more, muhammad, ali, died, at, ras, el, tin, palace, in, alexandria, on, 2, august, 1849, and, ultimately, was, buried, in, the, imposing, mosque, he, had, commissioned, in, the, cairo, citadel, but, the, immediate, reaction, to, his, death, was, noticeably, low, profile, thanks, in, no, small, part, to, the, contempt, the, new, w, li, abbas, pasha, had, always, felt, towards, his, grandfather, eyewitness, british, consul, john, murray, wrote, the, ceremonial, of, the, funeral, was, a, most, meagre, miserable, affair, the, consular, was, not, invited, to, attend, and, neither, the, shops, nor, the, public, offices, were, closed, in, short, a, general, impression, prevails, that, abbas, pasha, has, shown, a, culpable, lack, of, respect, for, the, memory, of, his, illustrious, grandfather, in, allowing, his, obsequies, to, be, conducted, in, so, paltry, a, manner, and, in, neglecting, to, attend, them, in, person, attachment, and, veneration, of, all, classes, in, egypt, for, the, name, of, muhammad, ali, are, prouder, obsequies, than, any, of, which, it, was, in, power, of, his, successor, to, confer, the, old, inhabitants, remember, and, talk, of, the, chaos, and, anarchy, from, which, he, rescued, this, country, the, younger, compare, his, energetic, rule, with, the, capricious, vacillating, government, of, his, successor, all, classes, whether, turk, or, arab, not, only, feel, but, do, not, hesitate, to, say, openly, that, the, prosperity, of, egypt, has, died, with, muhammad, ali, in, truth, my, lord, it, cannot, be, denied, that, muhammad, ali, notwithstanding, all, his, faults, was, a, great, man, the, prevailing, historical, view, of, muhammad, ali, is, as, the, father, of, modern, egypt, being, the, first, ruler, since, the, ottoman, conquest, in, 1517, to, permanently, divest, the, porte, of, its, power, in, egypt, while, failing, to, achieve, formal, independence, for, egypt, during, his, lifetime, he, was, successful, in, laying, the, foundation, for, a, modern, egyptian, state, in, the, process, of, building, an, army, to, defend, and, expand, his, realm, he, built, a, central, bureaucracy, an, educational, system, that, allowed, social, mobility, and, an, economic, base, that, included, an, agricultural, cash, crop, cotton, and, military, based, manufacturing, his, efforts, established, his, progeny, as, the, rulers, of, egypt, and, sudan, for, nearly, 150, years, and, rendered, egypt, a, de, facto, independent, state, others, however, view, him, not, as, a, builder, but, rather, as, a, conqueror, he, was, of, albanian, origin, rather, than, egyptian, and, throughout, his, reign, ottoman, turkish, was, the, official, language, of, his, court, rather, than, arabic, some, argue, that, he, exploited, egyptian, manpower, and, resources, for, his, own, personal, ends, not, egyptian, national, ones, with, the, manpower, requirements, that, he, placed, on, egyptians, being, particularly, onerous, taken, together, in, this, light, muhammad, ali, is, cast, by, some, as, another, in, a, long, line, of, foreign, conquerors, dating, back, to, the, persian, occupation, in, 525, b, c, this, view, however, is, at, odds, with, the, majority, opinion, of, egyptian, and, other, arab, historians, and, egyptian, public, opinion, much, of, the, historical, debate, regarding, muhammad, ali, reflects, the, simultaneous, political, struggles, which, occurred, in, egypt, during, the, 20th, century, fuad, i, of, egypt, in, the, 1930s, sponsored, the, collection, arrangement, and, translation, of, the, available, historical, documents, relating, to, his, predecessors, which, became, the, royal, archives, of, egypt, these, royal, archives, represented, the, primary, and, in, the, case, of, some, important, works, the, only, source, of, information, for, egyptian, history, until, the, sharia, court, records, became, available, in, the, 1970s, fuad, s, portrayal, of, muhammad, ali, as, a, nationalist, and, benevolent, monarch, therefore, heavily, influenced, the, historical, debate, later, nasser, and, his, revolutionary, republican, regime, promoted, an, alternative, narrative, which, portrayed, muhammad, ali, as, the, nationalist, founder, of, modern, egypt, but, also, an, ambitious, monarch, with, little, regard, for, his, people, whose, policies, ultimately, benefited, himself, and, his, dynasty, at, the, expense, of, egypt, in, the, meanwhile, the, albanian, commander, mehmed, ali, came, to, shine, amid, the, limelight, of, politics, and, became, immensely, popular, among, the, inhabitants, as, his, biographer, tells, us, mehmed, ali, was, a, man, who, had, mastered, the, art, of, staging, spectacles, and, of, influencing, audiences, the, french, consul, believed, that, albanian, has, more, character, and, would, probably, be, less, sensitive, to, the, advice, and, the, means, of, seduction, of, our, enemies
