giotto, di, bondone, italian, c, 1267, january, 8, 1337, known, mononymously, as, giotto, uk, d, t, o, jot, oh, us, d, i, t, o, d, t, o, jee, ot, oh, jaw, toh, and, latinised, as, giottus, was, an, italian, painter, and, architect, from, florence, during, the, late, middle, ages, he, worked, during, the, gothic, and, proto, renaissance, period, giotto, s, contemporary, the, banker, and, chronicler, giovanni, villani, wrote, that, giotto, was, the, most, sovereign, master, of, painting, in, his, time, who, drew, all, his, figures, and, their, postures, according, to, nature, and, of, his, publicly, recognized, talent, and, excellence, giorgio, vasari, described, giotto, as, making, a, decisive, break, from, the, prevalent, byzantine, style, and, as, initiating, the, great, art, of, painting, as, we, know, it, today, introducing, the, technique, of, drawing, accurately, from, life, which, had, been, neglected, for, more, than, two, hundred, years, giotto, s, masterwork, is, the, decoration, of, the, scrovegni, chapel, in, padua, also, known, as, the, arena, chapel, which, was, completed, around, 1305, the, fresco, cycle, depicts, the, life, of, the, virgin, and, the, life, of, christ, it, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, supreme, masterpieces, of, the, early, renaissance, the, fact, that, giotto, painted, the, arena, chapel, and, that, he, was, chosen, by, the, commune, of, florence, in, 1334, to, design, the, new, campanile, bell, tower, of, the, florence, cathedral, are, among, the, few, certainties, about, his, life, almost, every, other, aspect, of, it, is, subject, to, controversy, his, birth, date, his, birthplace, his, appearance, his, apprenticeship, the, order, in, which, he, created, his, works, whether, he, painted, the, famous, frescoes, in, the, upper, basilica, of, saint, francis, in, assisi, and, his, burial, place, tradition, says, that, giotto, was, born, in, a, farmhouse, perhaps, at, colle, di, romagnano, or, romignano, since, 1850, a, tower, house, in, nearby, colle, vespignano, has, borne, a, plaque, claiming, the, honor, of, his, birthplace, an, assertion, that, is, commercially, publicized, however, recent, research, has, presented, documentary, evidence, that, he, was, born, in, florence, the, son, of, a, blacksmith, his, father, s, name, was, bondone, most, authors, accept, that, giotto, was, his, real, name, but, may, have, been, an, abbreviation, of, ambrogio, ambrogiotto, or, angelo, angelotto, in, his, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, vasari, states, that, giotto, was, a, shepherd, boy, a, merry, and, intelligent, child, who, was, loved, by, all, who, knew, him, the, great, florentine, painter, cimabue, discovered, giotto, drawing, pictures, of, his, sheep, on, a, rock, they, were, so, lifelike, that, cimabue, approached, giotto, and, asked, if, he, could, take, him, on, as, an, apprentice, cimabue, was, one, of, the, two, most, highly, renowned, painters, of, tuscany, the, other, being, duccio, who, worked, mainly, in, siena, vasari, recounts, a, number, of, such, stories, about, giotto, s, skill, as, a, young, artist, he, tells, of, one, occasion, when, cimabue, was, absent, from, the, workshop, and, giotto, painted, a, remarkably, lifelike, fly, on, a, face, in, a, painting, of, cimabue, when, cimabue, returned, he, tried, several, times, to, brush, the, fly, off, many, scholars, today, are, uncertain, about, giotto, s, training, and, consider, vasari, s, account, that, he, was, cimabue, s, pupil, a, legend, they, cite, earlier, sources, that, suggest, that, giotto, was, not, cimabue, s, pupil, the, story, about, the, fly, is, also, suspect, because, it, parallels, pliny, the, elder, s, anecdote, about, zeuxis, painting, grapes, so, lifelike, that, birds, tried, to, peck, at, them, vasari, also, relates, that, when, pope, benedict, xi, sent, a, messenger, to, giotto, asking, him, to, send, a, drawing, to, demonstrate, his, skill, giotto, drew, a, red, circle, so, perfect, that, it, seemed, as, though, it, was, drawn, using, a, pair, of, compasses, and, instructed, the, messenger, to, send, it, to, the, pope, the, messenger, departed, ill, pleased, believing, that, he, had, been, made, a, fool, of, the, messenger, brought, other, artists, drawings, back, to, the, pope, in, addition, to, giotto, s, when, the, messenger, related, how, he, had, made, the, circle, without, moving, his, arm, and, without, the, aid, of, compasses, the, pope, and, his, courtiers, were, amazed, at, how, giotto, s, skill, greatly, surpassed, all, of, his, contemporaries, around, 1290, giotto, married, ricevuta, di, lapo, del, pela, known, as, ciuta, the, daughter, of, lapo, del, pela, of, florence, the, marriage, produced, four, daughters, and, four, sons, one, of, whom, francesco, became, a, painter, giotto, worked, in, rome, in, 1297, 1300, but, few, traces, of, his, presence, there, remain, today, by, 1301, giotto, owned, a, house, in, florence, and, when, he, was, not, traveling, he, would, return, there, and, live, in, comfort, with, his, family, by, the, early, 1300s, he, had, multiple, painting, commissions, in, florence, the, archbasilica, of, st, john, lateran, houses, a, small, portion, of, a, fresco, cycle, painted, for, the, jubilee, of, 1300, called, by, boniface, viii, he, also, designed, the, navicella, a, mosaic, that, decorated, the, facade, of, old, st, peter, s, basilica, in, this, period, giotto, also, painted, the, badia, polyptych, now, in, the, uffizi, florence, cimabue, went, to, assisi, to, paint, several, large, frescoes, at, the, new, basilica, of, saint, francis, of, assisi, and, it, is, possible, but, not, certain, that, giotto, went, with, him, the, attribution, of, the, fresco, cycle, of, the, life, of, st, francis, in, the, upper, church, has, been, one, of, the, most, disputed, in, art, history, the, documents, of, the, franciscan, friars, that, relate, to, artistic, commissions, during, this, period, were, destroyed, by, napoleon, s, troops, who, stabled, horses, in, the, upper, church, of, the, basilica, so, scholars, have, debated, the, attribution, to, giotto, in, the, absence, of, evidence, to, the, contrary, it, was, convenient, to, attribute, every, fresco, in, the, upper, church, not, obviously, by, cimabue, to, the, better, known, giotto, including, those, frescoes, now, attributed, to, the, master, of, isaac, in, the, 1960s, art, experts, millard, meiss, and, leonetto, tintori, examined, all, of, the, assisi, frescoes, and, found, some, of, the, paint, contained, white, lead, also, used, in, cimabue, s, badly, deteriorated, crucifixion, c, 1283, no, known, works, by, giotto, contain, this, medium, however, giotto, s, panel, painting, of, the, stigmatization, of, st, francis, c, 1297, includes, a, motif, of, the, saint, holding, up, the, collapsing, church, previously, included, in, the, assisi, frescoes, the, authorship, of, a, large, number, of, panel, paintings, ascribed, to, giotto, by, vasari, among, others, is, as, broadly, disputed, as, the, assisi, frescoes, according, to, vasari, giotto, s, earliest, works, were, for, the, dominicans, at, santa, maria, novella, they, include, a, fresco, of, the, annunciation, and, an, enormous, suspended, crucifix, which, is, about, 5, metres, 16, feet, high, it, has, been, dated, to, about, 1290, and, is, thought, to, be, contemporary, with, the, assisi, frescoes, earlier, attributed, works, are, the, san, giorgio, alla, costa, madonna, and, child, now, in, the, diocesan, museum, of, santo, stefano, al, ponte, florence, and, the, signed, panel, of, the, stigmatization, of, st, francis, housed, in, the, louvre, an, early, biographical, source, riccobaldo, of, ferrara, mentions, that, giotto, painted, at, assisi, but, does, not, specify, the, st, francis, cycle, what, kind, of, art, made, is, testified, to, by, works, done, by, him, in, the, franciscan, churches, at, assisi, rimini, padua, since, the, idea, was, put, forward, by, the, german, art, historian, friedrich, rintelen, in, 1912, many, scholars, have, expressed, doubt, that, giotto, was, the, author, of, the, upper, church, frescoes, without, documentation, arguments, on, the, attribution, have, relied, upon, connoisseurship, a, notoriously, unreliable, science, but, technical, examinations, and, comparisons, of, the, workshop, painting, processes, at, assisi, and, padua, in, 2002, have, provided, strong, evidence, that, giotto, did, not, paint, the, st, francis, cycle, there, are, many, differences, between, it, and, the, arena, chapel, frescoes, that, are, difficult, to, account, for, within, the, stylistic, development, of, an, individual, artist, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, four, different, hands, are, identifiable, in, the, assisi, st, francis, frescoes, and, that, they, came, from, rome, if, this, is, the, case, giotto, s, frescoes, at, padua, owe, much, to, the, naturalism, of, the, painters, giotto, s, fame, as, a, painter, spread, he, was, called, to, work, in, padua, and, also, in, rimini, where, there, remains, only, a, crucifix, painted, before, 1309, and, conserved, in, the, church, of, st, francis, it, influenced, the, rise, of, the, riminese, school, of, giovanni, and, pietro, da, rimini, according, to, documents, of, 1301, and, 1304, giotto, by, this, time, possessed, large, estates, in, florence, and, it, is, probable, that, he, was, already, leading, a, large, workshop, and, receiving, commissions, from, throughout, italy, around, 1305, giotto, executed, his, most, influential, work, the, interior, frescoes, of, the, scrovegni, chapel, in, padua, that, in, 2021, were, declared, unesco, world, heritage, together, with, other, 14th, century, fresco, cycles, in, different, buildings, around, the, city, centre, enrico, degli, scrovegni, commissioned, the, chapel, to, serve, as, family, worship, burial, space, and, as, a, backdrop, for, an, annually, performed, mystery, play, the, theme, of, the, decoration, is, salvation, and, there, is, an, emphasis, on, the, virgin, mary, as, the, chapel, is, dedicated, to, the, annunciation, and, to, the, virgin, of, charity, as, was, common, in, church, decoration, of, medieval, italy, the, west, wall, is, dominated, by, the, last, judgement, on, either, side, of, the, chancel, are, complementary, paintings, of, the, angel, gabriel, and, the, virgin, mary, depicting, the, annunciation, the, scene, is, incorporated, into, the, cycles, of, the, life, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, and, the, life, of, christ, giotto, s, inspiration, for, the, life, of, the, virgin, cycle, was, probably, taken, from, the, golden, legend, by, jacobus, de, voragine, and, the, life, of, christ, draws, upon, the, meditations, on, the, life, of, christ, as, well, as, the, bible, the, frescoes, are, more, than, mere, illustrations, of, familiar, texts, however, and, scholars, have, found, numerous, sources, for, giotto, s, interpretations, of, sacred, stories, vasari, drawing, on, a, description, by, giovanni, boccaccio, a, friend, of, giotto, s, says, of, him, that, there, was, no, uglier, man, in, the, city, of, florence, and, indicates, that, his, children, were, also, plain, in, appearance, there, is, a, story, that, dante, visited, giotto, while, he, was, painting, the, scrovegni, chapel, and, seeing, the, artist, s, children, underfoot, asked, how, a, man, who, painted, such, beautiful, pictures, could, have, such, plain, children, giotto, who, according, to, vasari, was, always, a, wit, replied, i, make, my, pictures, by, day, and, my, babies, by, night, the, cycle, is, divided, into, 37, scenes, arranged, around, the, lateral, walls, in, three, tiers, starting, in, the, upper, register, with, the, story, of, st, joachim, and, st, anne, the, parents, of, the, virgin, and, continuing, with, her, early, life, the, life, of, jesus, occupies, two, registers, the, top, south, tier, deals, with, the, lives, of, mary, s, parents, the, top, north, with, her, early, life, and, the, entire, middle, tier, with, the, early, life, and, miracles, of, christ, the, bottom, tier, on, both, sides, is, concerned, with, the, passion, of, christ, he, is, depicted, mainly, in, profile, and, his, eyes, point, continuously, to, the, right, perhaps, to, guide, the, viewer, onwards, in, the, episodes, the, kiss, of, judas, near, the, end, of, the, sequence, signals, the, close, of, this, left, to, right, procession, below, the, narrative, scenes, in, colour, giotto, also, painted, allegories, of, seven, virtues, and, their, counterparts, in, monochrome, grey, grisaille, the, grisaille, frescoes, are, painted, to, look, like, marble, statues, that, personify, virtues, and, vices, the, central, allegories, of, justice, and, injustice, oppose, two, specific, types, of, government, peace, leading, to, a, festival, of, love, and, tyranny, resulting, in, wartime, rape, between, the, narrative, scenes, are, quatrefoil, paintings, of, old, testament, scenes, like, jonah, and, the, whale, that, allegorically, correspond, to, and, perhaps, foretell, the, life, of, christ, much, of, the, blue, in, the, frescoes, has, been, worn, away, by, time, the, expense, of, the, ultramarine, blue, pigment, used, required, it, to, be, painted, on, top, of, the, already, dry, fresco, a, secco, to, preserve, its, brilliance, that, is, why, it, has, disintegrated, faster, than, the, other, colours, which, were, painted, on, wet, plaster, and, have, bonded, with, the, wall, an, example, of, the, decay, can, clearly, be, seen, on, the, robe, of, the, virgin, in, the, fresco, of, the, nativity, giotto, s, style, drew, on, the, solid, and, classicizing, sculpture, of, arnolfo, di, cambio, unlike, those, by, cimabue, and, duccio, giotto, s, figures, are, not, stylized, or, elongated, and, do, not, follow, byzantine, models, they, are, solidly, three, dimensional, have, faces, and, gestures, that, are, based, on, close, observation, and, are, clothed, not, in, swirling, formalized, drapery, but, in, garments, that, hang, naturally, and, have, form, and, weight, he, also, took, bold, steps, in, foreshortening, and, having, characters, face, inwards, with, their, backs, towards, the, observer, creating, the, illusion, of, space, the, figures, occupy, compressed, settings, with, naturalistic, elements, often, using, forced, perspective, devices, so, that, they, resemble, stage, sets, this, similarity, is, increased, by, giotto, s, careful, arrangement, of, the, figures, in, such, a, way, that, the, viewer, appears, to, have, a, particular, place, and, even, an, involvement, in, many, of, the, scenes, that, can, be, seen, most, markedly, in, the, arrangement, of, the, figures, in, the, mocking, of, christ, and, lamentation, in, which, the, viewer, is, bidden, by, the, composition, to, become, mocker, in, one, and, mourner, in, the, other, giotto, s, depiction, of, the, human, face, and, emotion, sets, his, work, apart, from, that, of, his, contemporaries, when, the, disgraced, joachim, returns, sadly, to, the, hillside, the, two, young, shepherds, look, sideways, at, each, other, the, soldier, who, drags, a, baby, from, its, screaming, mother, in, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, does, so, with, his, head, hunched, into, his, shoulders, and, a, look, of, shame, on, his, face, the, people, on, the, road, to, egypt, gossip, about, mary, and, joseph, as, they, go, of, giotto, s, realism, the, 19th, century, english, critic, john, ruskin, said, he, painted, the, madonna, and, st, joseph, and, the, christ, yes, by, all, means, but, essentially, mamma, papa, and, baby, famous, narratives, in, the, series, include, the, adoration, of, the, magi, in, which, a, comet, like, star, of, bethlehem, streaks, across, the, sky, giotto, is, thought, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, 1301, appearance, of, halley, s, comet, which, led, to, the, 1986, space, probe, giotto, being, named, after, the, artist, giotto, worked, on, other, frescoes, in, padua, some, now, lost, such, as, those, that, were, in, the, basilica, of, st, anthony, and, the, palazzo, della, ragione, numerous, painters, from, northern, italy, were, influenced, by, giotto, s, work, in, padua, including, guariento, giusto, de, menabuoi, jacopo, avanzi, and, altichiero, from, 1306, from, 1311, giotto, was, in, assisi, where, he, painted, the, frescoes, in, the, transept, area, of, the, lower, church, of, the, basilica, of, st, francis, including, the, life, of, christ, franciscan, allegories, and, the, magdalene, chapel, drawing, on, stories, from, the, golden, legend, and, including, the, portrait, of, bishop, teobaldo, pontano, who, commissioned, the, work, several, assistants, are, mentioned, including, palerino, di, guido, the, style, demonstrates, developments, from, giotto, s, work, at, padua, in, 1311, giotto, returned, to, florence, a, document, from, 1313, about, his, furniture, there, shows, that, he, had, spent, a, period, in, rome, sometime, beforehand, it, is, now, thought, that, he, produced, the, design, for, the, famous, navicella, mosaic, for, the, courtyard, of, the, old, st, peter, s, basilica, in, 1310, commissioned, by, cardinal, giacomo, or, jacopo, stefaneschi, and, now, lost, to, the, renaissance, church, except, for, some, fragments, and, a, baroque, reconstruction, according, to, the, cardinal, s, necrology, he, also, at, least, designed, the, stefaneschi, triptych, c, 1320, a, double, sided, altarpiece, for, st, peter, s, now, in, the, vatican, pinacoteca, it, shows, st, peter, enthroned, with, saints, on, the, front, and, on, the, reverse, christ, is, enthroned, framed, with, scenes, of, the, martyrdom, of, saints, peter, and, paul, it, is, one, of, the, few, works, by, giotto, for, which, firm, evidence, of, a, commission, exists, however, the, style, seems, unlikely, for, either, giotto, or, his, normal, florentine, assistants, so, he, may, have, had, his, design, executed, by, an, ad, hoc, workshop, of, romans, the, cardinal, also, commissioned, giotto, to, decorate, the, apse, of, st, peter, s, basilica, with, a, cycle, of, frescoes, that, were, destroyed, during, the, 16th, century, renovation, according, to, vasari, giotto, remained, in, rome, for, six, years, subsequently, receiving, numerous, commissions, in, italy, and, in, the, papal, seat, at, avignon, but, some, of, the, works, are, now, recognized, to, be, by, other, artists, in, florence, where, documents, from, 1314, to, 1327, attest, to, his, financial, activities, giotto, painted, an, altarpiece, known, as, the, ognissanti, madonna, which, is, now, on, display, in, the, uffizi, where, it, is, exhibited, beside, cimabue, s, santa, trinita, madonna, and, duccio, s, rucellai, madonna, the, ognissanti, altarpiece, is, the, only, panel, painting, by, giotto, that, has, been, universally, accepted, by, scholars, despite, the, fact, that, it, is, undocumented, it, was, painted, for, the, church, of, the, ognissanti, all, saints, in, florence, which, was, built, by, an, obscure, religious, order, known, as, the, humiliati, it, is, a, large, painting, 325, x, 204, cm, and, scholars, are, divided, on, whether, it, was, made, for, the, main, altar, of, the, church, where, it, would, have, been, viewed, primarily, by, the, brothers, of, the, order, or, for, the, choir, screen, where, it, would, have, been, more, easily, seen, by, a, lay, audience, he, also, painted, around, the, time, the, dormition, of, the, virgin, now, in, the, berlin, gem, ldegalerie, and, the, crucifix, in, the, church, of, ognissanti, according, to, lorenzo, ghiberti, giotto, painted, chapels, for, four, different, florentine, families, in, the, church, of, santa, croce, but, he, does, not, identify, which, chapels, it, is, only, with, vasari, that, the, four, chapels, are, identified, the, bardi, chapel, life, of, st, francis, the, peruzzi, chapel, life, of, st, john, the, baptist, and, st, john, the, evangelist, perhaps, including, a, polyptych, of, madonna, with, saints, now, in, the, museum, of, art, of, raleigh, north, carolina, and, the, lost, giugni, chapel, stories, of, the, apostles, and, the, tosinghi, spinelli, chapel, stories, of, the, holy, virgin, as, with, almost, everything, in, giotto, s, career, the, dates, of, the, fresco, decorations, that, survive, in, santa, croce, are, disputed, the, bardi, chapel, immediately, to, the, right, of, the, main, chapel, of, the, church, was, painted, in, true, fresco, and, to, some, scholars, the, simplicity, of, its, settings, seems, relatively, close, to, those, of, padua, but, the, peruzzi, chapel, s, more, complex, settings, suggest, a, later, date, the, peruzzi, chapel, is, adjacent, to, the, bardi, chapel, and, was, largely, painted, a, secco, the, technique, quicker, but, less, durable, than, a, true, fresco, has, left, the, work, in, a, seriously, deteriorated, condition, scholars, who, date, the, cycle, earlier, in, giotto, s, career, see, the, growing, interest, in, architectural, expansion, that, it, displays, as, close, to, the, developments, of, the, giottesque, frescoes, in, the, lower, church, at, assisi, but, the, bardi, frescoes, have, a, new, softness, of, colour, that, indicates, the, artist, going, in, a, different, direction, probably, under, the, influence, of, sienese, art, so, it, must, be, later, the, peruzzi, chapel, pairs, three, frescoes, from, the, life, of, st, john, the, baptist, the, annunciation, of, john, s, birth, to, his, father, zacharias, the, birth, and, naming, of, john, the, feast, of, herod, on, the, left, wall, with, three, scenes, from, the, life, of, st, john, the, evangelist, the, visions, of, john, on, ephesus, the, raising, of, drusiana, the, ascension, of, john, on, the, right, wall, the, choice, of, scenes, has, been, related, to, both, the, patrons, and, the, franciscans, because, of, the, deteriorated, condition, of, the, frescoes, it, is, difficult, to, discuss, giotto, s, style, in, the, chapel, but, the, frescoes, show, signs, of, his, typical, interest, in, controlled, naturalism, and, psychological, penetration, the, peruzzi, chapel, was, especially, renowned, during, renaissance, times, giotto, s, compositions, influenced, masaccio, s, frescos, at, the, brancacci, chapel, and, michelangelo, is, also, known, to, have, studied, them, the, bardi, chapel, depicts, the, life, of, st, francis, following, a, similar, iconography, to, the, frescoes, in, the, upper, church, at, assisi, dating, from, 20, to, 30, years, earlier, a, comparison, shows, the, greater, attention, given, by, giotto, to, expression, in, the, human, figures, and, the, simpler, better, integrated, architectural, forms, giotto, represents, only, seven, scenes, from, the, saint, s, life, and, the, narrative, is, arranged, somewhat, unusually, the, story, starts, on, the, upper, left, wall, with, st, francis, renounces, his, father, it, continues, across, the, chapel, to, the, upper, right, wall, with, the, approval, of, the, franciscan, rule, moves, down, the, right, wall, to, the, trial, by, fire, across, the, chapel, again, to, the, left, wall, for, the, appearance, at, arles, down, the, left, wall, to, the, death, of, st, francis, and, across, once, more, to, the, posthumous, visions, of, fra, agostino, and, the, bishop, of, assisi, the, stigmatization, of, st, francis, which, chronologically, belongs, between, the, appearance, at, arles, and, the, death, is, located, outside, the, chapel, above, the, entrance, arch, the, arrangement, encourages, viewers, to, link, scenes, together, to, pair, frescoes, across, the, chapel, space, or, relate, triads, of, frescoes, along, each, wall, the, linkings, suggest, meaningful, symbolic, relationships, between, different, events, in, st, francis, s, life, in, 1328, the, altarpiece, of, the, baroncelli, chapel, santa, croce, florence, was, completed, previously, ascribed, to, giotto, it, is, now, believed, to, be, mostly, a, work, by, assistants, including, taddeo, gaddi, who, later, frescoed, the, chapel, the, next, year, giotto, was, called, by, king, robert, of, anjou, to, naples, where, he, remained, with, a, group, of, pupils, until, 1333, few, of, giotto, s, neapolitan, works, have, survived, a, fragment, of, a, fresco, portraying, the, lamentation, of, christ, in, the, church, of, santa, chiara, and, the, illustrious, men, that, is, painted, on, the, windows, of, the, santa, barbara, chapel, of, castel, nuovo, which, are, usually, attributed, to, his,

degli, angeli, and, according, to, some, sources, a, lost, decoration, for, the, chapel, in, the, cardinal, legate, s, castle, in, 1334, giotto, was, appointed, chief, architect, to, florence, cathedral, he, designed, the, bell, tower, known, as, giotto, s, campanile, begun, on, july, 18, 1334, after, giotto, s, death, three, years, later, andrea, pisano, and, finally, francesco, talenti, took, over, the, tower, s, construction, completed, in, 1359, and, not, entirely, to, giotto, s, design, before, 1337, he, was, in, milan, with, azzone, visconti, but, no, trace, of, works, by, him, remains, in, the, city, his, last, known, work, was, with, assistants, help, the, decoration, of, podest, chapel, in, the, bargello, florence, giotto, appears, in, the, writings, of, many, contemporary, authors, including, boccaccio, dante, and, franco, sacchetti, sacchetti, recounted, the, likely, fictional, incident, in, which, a, civilian, commissioned, giotto, to, paint, a, shield, with, his, coat, of, arms, giotto, instead, painted, the, shield, armed, to, the, teeth, complete, with, a, sword, lance, dagger, and, suit, of, armor, he, told, the, man, to, go, into, the, world, a,

the, spot, marked, by, a, white, marble, plaque, according, to, other, sources, he, was, buried, in, the, church, of, santa, reparata, the, apparently, contradictory, reports, are, explained, by, the, fact, that, the, remains, of, santa, reparata, are, directly, beneath, the, cathedral, and, the, church, continued, in, use, while, the, construction, of, the, cathedral, proceeded, in, the, early, 14th, century, during, an, excavation, in, the, 1970s, bones, were, discovered, beneath, the, paving, of, santa, reparata, at, a, spot, close, to, the, location, given, by, vasari, but, unmarked, on, either, level, forensic, examination, of, the, bones, by, anthropologist, francesco, mallegni, and, a, team, of, experts, in, 2000, brought, to, light, some, evidence, that, seemed, to, confirm, that, they, were, those, of, a, painter, particularly, the, range, of, chemicals, including, arsenic, and, lead, both, commonly, found, in, paint, which, the, bones, had, absorbed, the, bones, were, those, of, a, very, short, man, little, over, four, feet, tall, who, may, have, suffered, from, a, form, of, congenital, dwarfism, that, supports, a, tradition, at, the, church, of, santa, croce, that, a, dwarf, who, appears, in, one, of, the, frescoes, is, a, self, portrait, of, giotto, on, the, other, hand, a, man, wearing, a, white, hat, who, appears, in, the, last, judgement, at, padua, is, also, said, to, be, a, portrait, of, giotto, the, appearance, of, this, man, conflicts, with, the, image, in, santa, croce, in, regards, to, stature, forensic, reconstruction, of, the, skeleton, at, santa, reperata, showed, a, short, man, with, a, very, large, head, a, large, hooked, nose, and, one, eye, more, prominent, than, the, other, the, bones, of, the, neck, indicated, that, the, man, spent, a, lot, of, time, with, his, head, tilted, backwards, the, front, teeth, were, worn, in, a, way, consistent, with, frequently, holding, a, brush, between, the, teeth, the, man, was, about, 70, at, the, time, of, death, while, the, italian, researchers, were, convinced, that, the, body, belonged, to, giotto, and, it, was, reburied, with, honour, near, the, grave, of, filippo, brunelleschi, others, have, been, highly, sceptical, franklin, toker, a, professor, of, art, history, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, who, was, present, at, the, original, excavation, in, 1970, says, that, they, are,
