and, his, musical, style, influenced, many, 20th, century, composers, among, his, best, known, works, are, his, pavane, requiem, sicilienne, nocturnes, for, piano, and, the, songs, apr, s, un, r, ve,

years, in, a, more, harmonically, and, melodically, complex, style, faur, was, born, into, a, cultured, but, not, especially, musical, family, his, talent, became, clear, when, he, was, a, young, boy, at, the, age, of, nine, he, was, sent, to, the, cole, niedermeyer, music, college, in, paris, where, he, was, trained, to, be, a, church, organist, and, choirmaster, among, his, teachers, was,

france, faur, s, music, took, decades, to, become, widely, accepted, except, in, britain, where, he, had, many, admirers, during, his, lifetime, faur, s, music, has, been, described, as, linking, the, end, of, romanticism, with, the, modernism, of, the, second, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, when, he, was, born, chopin, was, still, composing, and, by, the, time, of, faur, s, death, jazz, and, the, atonal, music, of, the, second, viennese, school, were, being, heard, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, which, describes, him, as, the, most, advanced, composer, of, his, generation, in, france, notes, that, his, harmonic, and, melodic, innovations, influenced, the, teaching, of, harmony, for, later, generations, during, the, last, twenty, years, of, his, life, he, suffered, from, increasing, deafness, in, contrast, with, the, charm, of, his, earlier, music, his, works, from, this, period, are, sometimes, elusive, and, withdrawn, in, character, and, at, other, times, turbulent, and, impassioned, faur, was, born, in, pamiers, ari, ge, in, the, south, of, france, the, fifth, son, and, youngest, of, six, children, of, toussaint, honor, faur, 1810, 85, and,

family, had, at, one, time, been, substantial, landowners, but, by, the, 19th, century, its, means, had, become, reduced, the, composer, s, paternal, grandfather, gabriel, was, a, butcher, whose, son, became, a, schoolmaster, in, 1829, faur, s, parents, married, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, minor, member, of, the, nobility, he, was, the, only, one, of, the, six, children, to, display, musical, talent, his, four, brothers, pursued, careers, in, journalism, politics, the, army, and, the, civil, service, and, his, sister, had, a, traditional, life, as, the, wife, of, a, public, servant, the, young, faur, was, sent, to, live, with, a, foster, mother, until, he, was, four, years, old, when, his, father, was, appointed, director, of, the, cole, normale, d, instituteurs, a, teacher, training, college, at, montgauzy, near, foix, in, 1849, faur, returned, to, live, with, his, family, there, was, a, chapel, attached, to, the, school, which, faur, recalled, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, i, grew, up, a, rather, quiet, well, behaved, child, in, an, area, of, great, beauty, but, the, only, thing, i, remember, really, clearly, is, the, harmonium, in, that, little, chapel, every, time, i, could, get, away, i, ran, there, and, i, regaled, myself, i, played, atrociously, no, method, at, all, quite, without, technique, but, i, do, remember, that, i, was, happy, and, if, that, is, what, it, means, to, have, a, vocation, then, it, is, a, very, pleasant, thing, an, old, blind, woman, who, came, to, listen, and, give, the, boy, advice, told, his, father, of, faur, s, gift, for, music, in, 1853, simon, lucien, dufaur, de, saubiac, of, the, national, assembly, heard, faur, play, and, advised, toussaint, honor, to, send, him, to, the, cole, de, musique, classique, et, religieuse, school, of, classical, and, religious, music, better, known, as, the, cole, niedermeyer, de, paris, which, louis, niedermeyer, was, setting, up, in, paris, after, reflecting, for, a, year, faur, s, father, agreed, and, took, the, nine, year, old, boy, to, paris, in, october, 1854, helped, by, a, scholarship, from, the, bishop, of, his, home, diocese, faur, boarded, at, the, school, for, 11, years, the, r, gime, was, austere, the, rooms, gloomy, the, food, mediocre, and, the, required, uniform, elaborate, the, musical, tuition, however, was, excellent, niedermeyer, whose, goal, was, to, produce, qualified, organists, and, choirmasters, focused, on, church, music, faur, s, tutors, were, cl, ment, loret, for, organ, louis, dietsch, for, harmony, xavier, wackenthaler, for, counterpoint, and, fugue, and, niedermeyer, for, piano, plainsong, and, composition, when, niedermeyer, died, in, march, 1861, camille, saint, sa, ns, took, charge, of, piano, studies, and, introduced, contemporary, music, including, that, of, schumann, liszt, and, wagner, faur, recalled, in, old, age, after, allowing, the, lessons, to, run, over, he, would, go, to, the, piano, and, reveal, to, us, those, works, of, the, masters, from, which, the, rigorous, classical, nature, of, our, programme, of, study, kept, us, at, a, distance, and, who, moreover, in, those, far, off, years, were, scarcely, known, at, the, time, i, was, 15, or, 16, and, from, this, time, dates, the, almost, filial, attachment, the, immense, admiration, the, unceasing, gratitude, i, had, for, him, throughout, my, life, saint, sa, ns, took, great, pleasure, in, his, pupil, s, progress, which, he, helped, whenever, he, could, nectoux, comments, that, at, each, step, in, faur, s, career, saint, sa, ns, s, shadow, can, effectively, be, taken, for, granted, the, close, friendship, between, them, lasted, until, saint, sa, ns, died, sixty, years, later, faur, won, many, prizes, while, at, the, school, including, a, premier, prix, in, composition, for, the, cantique, de, jean, racine, op, 11, the, earliest, of, his, choral, works, to, enter, the, regular, repertory, he, left, the,

giving, countless, piano, lessons, at, saint, sa, ns, s, regular, prompting, he, continued, to, compose, but, none, of, his, works, from, this, period, survive, he, was, bored, at, rennes, and, had, an, uneasy, relationship, with, the, parish, priest, who, correctly, doubted, faur, s, religious, conviction, faur, was, regularly, seen, stealing, out, during, the, sermon, for, a, cigarette, and, in, early, 1870, when, he, turned, up, to, play, at, mass, one, sunday, still, in, his, evening, clothes, having, been, out, all, night, at, a, ball, he, was, asked, to, resign, almost, immediately, with, the, discreet, aid, of, saint, sa, ns, he, secured, the, post, of, assistant, organist, at, the, church, of, notre, dame, de, clignancourt, in, the, north, of, paris, he, remained, there, for, only, a, few, months, on, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, he, volunteered, for, military, service, he, took, part, in, the, action, to, raise, the, siege, of, paris, and, saw, action, at, le, bourget, champigny, and, cr, teil, he, was, awarded, a, croix, de, guerre, after, france, s, defeat, by, prussia, there, was, a, brief, bloody, conflict, within, paris, from, march, to, may, 1871, during, the, commune, faur, escaped, to, rambouillet, where, one, of, his, brothers, lived, and, then, travelled, to, switzerland, where, he, took, up, a, teaching, post, at, the, cole, niedermeyer, which, had, temporarily, relocated, there, to, avoid, the, violence, in, paris, his, first, pupil, at, the, school, was, andr, messager, who, became, a, lifelong, friend, and, occasional, collaborator, faur, s, compositions, from, this, period, did, not, overtly, reflect, the, turmoil, and, bloodshed, some, of, his, colleagues, including, saint, sa, ns, gounod, and, franck, produced, elegies, and, patriotic, odes, faur, did, not, but, according, to, his, biographer, jessica, duchen, his, music, acquired, a, new, sombreness, a, dark, hued, sense, of, tragedy, evident, mainly, in, his, songs, of, this, period, including, l, absent, seule, and, la, chanson, du, p, cheur, when, faur, returned, to, paris, in, october, 1871, he, was, appointed, choirmaster, at, the, glise, saint, sulpice, under, the, composer, and, organist, charles, marie, widor, in, the, course, of, his, duties, he, wrote, several, canticles, and, motets, few, of, which, have, survived, during, some, services, widor, and, faur, improvised, simultaneously, at, the, church, s, two, organs, trying, to, catch, each, other, out, with, sudden, changes, of, key, faur, regularly, attended, saint, sa, ns, s, musical, salons, and, those, of, pauline, viardot, to, whom, saint, sa, ns, introduced, him, faur, was, a, founding, member, of, the, soci, t, nationale, de, musique, formed, in, february, 1871, under, the, joint, chairmanship, of, romain, bussine, and, saint, sa, ns, to, promote, new, french, music, other, members, included, georges, bizet, emmanuel, chabrier, vincent, d, indy, henri, duparc, c, sar, franck, douard, lalo, and, jules, massenet, faur, became, secretary, of, the, society, in, 1874, many, of, his, works, were, first, presented, at, the, society, s, concerts, in, 1874, faur, moved, from, saint, sulpice, to, the, glise, de, la, madeleine, acting, as, deputy, for, the, principal, organist, saint, sa, ns, during, the, latter, s, many, absences, on, tour, some, admirers, of, faur, s, music, have, expressed, regret, that, although, he, played, the, organ, professionally, for, four, decades, he, left, no, solo, compositions, for, the, instrument, he, was, renowned, for, his, improvisations, and, saint, sa, ns, said, of, him, that, he, was, a, first, class, organist, when, he, wanted, to, be, faur, preferred, the, piano, to, the, organ, which, he, played, only, because, it, gave, him, a, regular, income, duchen, speculates, that, he, positively, disliked, the, organ, possibly, because, for, a, composer, of, such, delicacy, of, nuance, and, such, sensuality, the, organ, was, simply, not, subtle, enough, the, year, 1877, was, significant, for, faur, both, professionally, and, personally, in, january, his, first, violin, sonata, was, performed, at, a, soci, t, nationale, concert, with, great, success, marking, a, turning, point, in, his, composing, career, at, the, age, of, 31, nectoux, counts, the, work, as, the, composer, s, first, great, masterpiece, in, march, saint, sa, ns, retired, from, the, madeleine, succeeded, as, organist, by, th, odore, dubois, his, choirmaster, faur, was, appointed, to, take, over, from, dubois, in, july, faur, became, engaged, to, pauline, viardot, s, daughter, marianne, with, whom, he, was, deeply, in, love, to, his, great, sorrow, she, broke, off, the, engagement, in, november, 1877, for, reasons, that, are, not, clear, to, distract, faur, saint, sa, ns, took, him, to, weimar, and, introduced, him, to, franz, liszt, this, visit, gave, faur, a, liking, for, foreign, travel, which, he, indulged, for, the, rest, of, his, life, from, 1878, he, and, messager, made, trips, abroad, to, see, wagner, operas, they, saw, das, rheingold, and, die, walk, re, at, the, cologne, opera, the, complete, ring, cycle, at, the, hofoper, in, munich, and, at, her, majesty, s, theatre, in, london, and, die, meistersinger, in, munich, and, at, bayreuth, where, they, also, saw, parsifal, they, frequently, performed, as, a, party, piece, their, joint, composition, the, irreverent, souvenirs, de, bayreuth, this, short, up, tempo, piano, work, for, four, hands, sends, up, themes, from, the, ring, faur, admired, wagner, and, had, a, detailed, knowledge, of, his, music, but, he, was, one, of, the, few, composers, of, his, generation, not, to, come, under, wagner, s, musical, influence, in, 1883, faur, married, marie, fremiet, the, daughter, of, a, leading, sculptor, emmanuel, fremiet, nectoux, comments, that, marie, was, without, beauty, wit, or, a, fortune, narrow, and, cold, but, records, that, in, spite, of, everything, still, felt, a, tenderness, towards, her, the, marriage, was, affectionate, but, marie, was, in, nectoux, s, phrase, a, stay, at, home, and, she, did, not, share, her, husband, s, wish, to, go, out, in, the, evenings, and, became, resentful, of, his, frequent, absences, his, dislike, of, domestic, life, horreur, du, domicile, and, his, love, affairs, while, she, remained, at, home, though, faur, valued, marie, as, a, friend, and, confidante, writing, to, her, often, sometimes, daily, when, away, from, home, she, did, not, share, his, passionate, nature, which, found, fulfilment, elsewhere, faur, and, his, wife, had, two, sons, the, first, born, in, 1883, emmanuel, faur, fremiet, marie, insisted, on, combining, her, family, name, with, faur, s, became, a, biologist, of, international, reputation, the, second, son, philippe, born, in, 1889, became, a, writer, his, works, included, histories, plays, and, biographies, of, his, father, and, grandfather, contemporary, accounts, agree, that, faur, was, extremely, attractive, to, women, in, duchen, s, phrase, his, conquests, were, legion, in, the, paris, salons, after, a, romantic, attachment, to, the, singer, emma, bardac, from, around, 1892, followed, by, another, to, the, composer, adela, maddison, in, 1900, faur, met, the, pianist, marguerite, hasselmans, the, daughter, of, alphonse, hasselmans, this, led, to, a, relationship, which, lasted, for, the, rest, of, faur, s, life, he, maintained, her, in, a, paris, apartment, and, she, acted, openly, as, his, companion, to, support, his, family, faur, spent, most, of, his, time, in, running, the, daily, services, at, the, madeleine, and, giving, piano, and, harmony, lessons, his, compositions, earned, him, a, negligible, amount, because, his, publisher, bought, them, outright, paying, him, an, average, of, 60, francs, for, a, song, and, faur, received, no, royalties, during, this, period, he, wrote, several, large, scale, works, in, addition, to, many, piano, pieces, and, songs, but, he, destroyed, most, of, them, after, a, few, performances, only, retaining, a, few, movements, in, order, to, re, use, motifs, among, the, works, surviving, from, this, period, is, the, requiem, begun, in, 1887, and, revised, and, expanded, over, the, years, until, its, final, version, dating, from, 1901, after, its, first, performance, in, 1888, the, priest, in, charge, told, the, composer, we, don, t, need, these, novelties, the, madeleine, s, repertoire, is, quite, rich, enough, as, a, young, man, faur, had, been, very, cheerful, a, friend, wrote, of, his, youthful, even, somewhat, child, like, mirth, from, his, thirties, he, suffered, bouts, of, depression, which, he, described, as, spleen, possibly, first, caused, by, his, broken, engagement, and, his, lack, of, success, as, a, composer, in, 1890, a, prestigious, and, remunerative, commission, to, write, an, opera, with, lyrics, by, paul, verlaine, was, aborted, by, the, poet, s, drunken, inability, to, deliver, a, libretto, faur, was, plunged, into, so, deep, a, depression, that, his, friends, were, seriously, concerned, about, his, health, winnaretta, de, scey, montb, liard, always, a, good, friend, to, faur, invited, him, to, venice, where, she, had, a, palazzo, on, the, grand, canal, he, recovered, his, spirits, and, began, to, compose, again, writing, the, first, of, his, five, m, lodies, de, venise, to, words, by, verlaine, whose, poetry, he, continued, to, admire, despite, the, operatic, debacle, about, this, time, or, shortly, afterwards, faur, s, liaison, with, emma, bardac, began, in, duchen, s, words, for, the, first, time, in, his, late, forties, he, experienced, a, fulfilling, passionate, relationship, which, extended, over, several, years, his, principal, biographers, all, agree, that, this, affair, inspired, a, burst, of, creativity, and, a, new, originality, in, his, music, exemplified, in, the, song, cycle, la, bonne, chanson, faur, wrote, the, dolly, suite, for, piano, duet, between, 1894, and, 1897, and, dedicated, it, to, bardac, s, daughter, h, l, ne, known, as, dolly, some, people, suspected, that, faur, was, dolly, s, father, but, biographers, including, nectoux, and, duchen, think, it, unlikely, faur, s, affair, with, emma, bardac, is, thought, to, have, begun, after, dolly, was, born, though, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, either, way, during, the, 1890s, faur, s, fortunes, improved, when, ernest, guiraud, professor, of, composition, at, the, paris, conservatoire, died, in, 1892, saint, sa, ns, encouraged, faur, to, apply, for, the, vacant, post, the, faculty, of, the, conservatoire, regarded, faur, as, dangerously, modern, and, its, head, ambroise, thomas, blocked, the, appointment, declaring, faur, never, if, he, s, appointed, i, resign, however, faur, was, appointed, to, another, of, guiraud, s, posts, inspector, of, the, music, conservatories, in, the, french, provinces, he, disliked, the, prolonged, travelling, around, the, country, that, the, work, entailed, but, the, post, gave, him, a, steady, income, and, enabled, him, to, give, up, teaching, amateur, pupils, in, 1896, ambroise, thomas, died, and, th, odore, dubois, took, over, as, head, of, the, conservatoire, faur, succeeded, dubois, as, chief, organist, of, the, madeleine, dubois, move, had, further, repercussions, massenet, professor, of, composition, at, the, conservatoire, had, expected, to, succeed, thomas, but, had, overplayed, his, hand, by, insisting, on, being, appointed, for, life, he, was, turned, down, and, when, dubois, was, appointed, instead, massenet, resigned, his, professorship, in, fury, faur, was, appointed, in, his, place, he, taught, many, young, composers, including, maurice, ravel, florent, schmitt, charles, koechlin, louis, aubert, jean, roger, ducasse, george, enescu, paul, ladmirault, alfredo, casella, and, nadia, boulanger, in, faur, s, view, his, students, needed, a, firm, grounding, in, the, basic, skills, which, he, was, happy, to, delegate, to, his, capable, assistant, andr, gedalge, his, own, part, came, in, helping, them, make, use, of, these, skills, in, the, way, that, suited, each, student, s, talents, roger, ducasse, later, wrote, taking, up, whatever, the, pupils, were, working, on, he, would, evoke, the, rules, of, the, form, at, hand, and, refer, to, examples, always, drawn, from, the, masters, ravel, always, remembered, faur, s, open, mindedness, as, a, teacher, having, received, ravel, s, string, quartet, with, less, than, his, usual, enthusiasm, faur, asked, to, see, the, manuscript, again, a, few, days, later, saying, i, could, have, been, wrong, the, musicologist, henry, pruni, res, wrote, what, faur, developed, among, his, pupils, was, taste, harmonic, sensibility, the, love, of, pure, lines, of, unexpected, and, colorful, modulations, but, he, never, gave, them, for, composing, according, to, his, style, and, that, is, why, they, all, sought, and, found, their, own, paths, in, many, different, and, often, opposed, directions, faur, s, works, of, the, last, years, of, the, century, include, incidental, music, for, the, english, premiere, of, maurice, maeterlinck, s, pell, as, et, m, lisande, 1898, and, prom, th, e, a, lyric, tragedy, composed, for, the, amphitheatre, at, b, ziers, written, for, outdoor, performance, the, work, is, scored, for, huge, instrumental, and, vocal, forces, its, premiere, in, august, 1900, was, a, great, success, and, it, was, revived, at, b, ziers, the, following, year, and, in, paris, in, 1907, a, version, with, orchestration, for, normal, opera, house, sized, forces, was, given, at, the, paris, op, ra, in, may, 1917, and, received, more, than, forty, performances, in, paris, thereafter, from, 1903, to, 1921, faur, regularly, wrote, music, criticism, for, le, figaro, a, role, in, which, he, was, not, at, ease, nectoux, writes, that, faur, s, natural, kindness, and, broad, mindedness, predisposed, him, to, emphasise, the, positive, aspects, of, a, work, in, 1905, a, scandal, erupted, in, french, musical, circles, over, the, country, s, top, musical, prize, the, prix, de, rome, faur, s, pupil, ravel, had, been, eliminated, prematurely, in, his, sixth, attempt, for, this, award, and, many, believed, that, reactionary, elements, within, the, conservatoire, had, played, a, part, in, it, dubois, who, became, the, subject, of, much, censure, brought, forward, his, retirement, and, stepped, down, at, once, appointed, in, his, place, and, with, the, support, of, the, french, government, faur, radically, changed, the, administration, and, curriculum, he, appointed, independent, external, judges, to, decide, on, admissions, examinations, and, competitions, a, move, which, enraged, faculty, members, who, had, given, preferential, treatment, to, their, private, pupils, feeling, themselves, deprived, of, a, considerable, extra, income, many, of, them, resigned, faur, was, dubbed, robespierre, by, disaffected, members, of, the, old, guard, as, he, modernised, and, broadened, the, range, of, music, taught, at, the, conservatoire, as, nectoux, puts, it, where, auber, hal, vy, and, especially, meyerbeer, had, reigned, supreme, it, was, now, possible, to, sing, an, aria, by, rameau, or, even, some, wagner, up, to, now, a, forbidden, name, within, the, conservatoire, s, walls, the, curriculum, was, broadened, to, range, from, renaissance, polyphony, to, the, works, of, debussy, faur, s, new, position, left, him, better, off, financially, however, while, he, also, became, much, more, widely, known, as, a, composer, running, the, conservatoire, left, him, with, no, more, time, for, composition, than, when, he, was, struggling, to, earn, a, living, as, an, organist, and, piano, teacher, as, soon, as, the, working, year, was, over, in, the, last, days, of, july, he, would, leave, paris, and, spend, the, two, months, until, early, october, in, a, hotel, usually, by, one, of, the, swiss, lakes, to, concentrate, on, composition, his, works, from, this, period, include, his, lyric, opera, p, n, lope, 1913, and, some, of, his, most, characteristic, later, songs, e, g, the, cycle, la, chanson, d, ve, op, 95, completed, in, 1910, and, piano, pieces, nocturnes, nos, 9, 11, barcarolles, nos, 7, 11, written, between, 1906, and, 1914, faur, was, elected, to, the, institut, de, france, in, 1909, after, his, father, in, law, and, saint, sa, ns, both, long, established, members, had, canvassed, strongly, on, his, behalf, he, won, the, ballot, by, a, narrow, margin, with, 18, votes, against, 16, for, the, other, candidate, widor, in, the, same, year, a, group, of, young, composers, led, by, ravel, and, koechlin, broke, with, the, soci, t, nationale, de, musique, which, under, the, presidency, of, vincent, d, indy, had, become, a, reactionary, organisation, and, formed, a, new, group, the, soci, t, musicale, ind, pendante, while, faur, accepted, the, presidency, of, this, society, he, also, remained, a, member, of, the, older, one, and, continued, on, the, best, of, terms, with, d, indy, his, sole, concern, was, the, fostering, of, new, music, in, 1911, he, oversaw, the, conservatoire, s, move, to, new, premises, in, the, rue, de, madrid, during, this, time, faur, developed, serious, problems, with, his, hearing, not, only, did, he, start, to, go, deaf, but, sounds, became, distorted, so, that, high, and, low, notes, sounded, painfully, out, of, tune, to, him, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, saw, a, rise, in, the, popularity, of, faur, s, music, in, britain, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, germany, spain, and, russia, he, visited, england, frequently, and, an, invitation, to, play, at, buckingham, palace, in, 1908, opened, many, other, doors, in, london, and, beyond, he, was, in, london, for, the, premiere, of, elgar, s, first, symphony, in, 1908, and, dined, with, the, composer, elgar, later, wrote, to, their, mutual, friend, frank, schuster, that, faur, was, such, a, real, gentleman, the, highest, kind, of, frenchman, and, i, admired, him, greatly, elgar, tried, to, get, faur, s, requiem, put, on, at, the, three, choirs, festival, but, it, did, not, finally, have, its, english, premiere, until, 1937, nearly, fifty, years, after, its, first, performance, in, france, composers, from, other, countries, also, loved, and, admired, faur, in, the, 1880s, tchaikovsky, had, thought, him, adorable, alb, niz, and, faur, were, friends, and, correspondents, until, the, former, s, early, death, in, 1909, richard, strauss, sought, his, advice, and, in, faur, s, last, years, the, young, american, aaron, copland, was, a, devoted, admirer, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, almost, stranded, faur, in, germany, where, he, had, gone, for, his, annual, composing, retreat, he, managed, to, get, from, germany, into, switzerland, and, thence, to, paris, he, remained, in, france, for, the, duration, of, the, war, when, a, group, of, french, musicians, led, by, saint, sa, ns, tried, to, organise, a, boycott, of, german, music, faur, and, messager, dissociated, themselves, from, the, idea, though, the, disagreement, did, not, affect, their, friendship, with, saint, sa, ns, faur, did, not, recognise, nationalism, in, music, seeing, in, his, art, a, language, belonging, to, a, country, so, far, above, all, others, that, it, is, dragged, down, when, it, has, to, express, feelings, or, individual, traits, that, belong, to, any, particular, nation, nonetheless, he, was, aware, that, his, own, music, was, respected, rather, than, loved, in, germany, in, january, 1905, visiting, frankfurt, and, cologne, for, concerts, of, his, music, he, had, written, the, criticisms, of, my, music, have, been, that, it, s, a, bit, cold, and, too, well, brought, up, there, s, no, question, about, it, french, and, german, are, two, different, things, in, 1920, at, the, age, of, 75, faur, retired, from, the, conservatoire, because, of, his, increasing, deafness, and, frailty, in, that, year, he, received, the, grand, croix, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, an, honour, rare, for, a, musician, in, 1922, the, president, of, the, republic, alexandre, millerand, led, a, public, tribute, to, faur, a, national, hommage, described, in, the, musical, times, as, a, splendid, celebration, at, the, sorbonne, in, which, the, most, illustrious, french, artists, participated, brought, him, great, joy, it, was, a, poignant, spectacle, indeed, that, of, a, man, present, at, a, concert, of, his, own, works, and, able, to, hear, not, a, single, note, he, sat, gazing, before, him, pensively, and, in, spite, of, everything, grateful, and, content, faur, suffered, from, poor, health, in, his, later, years, brought, on, in, part, by, heavy, smoking, despite, this, he, remained, available, to, young, composers, including, members, of, les, six, most, of, whom, were, devoted, to, him, nectoux, writes, in, old, age, he, attained, a, kind, of, serenity, without, losing, any, of, his, remarkable, spiritual, vitality, but, rather, removed, from, the, sensualism, and, the, passion, of, the, works, he, wrote, between, 1875, and, 1895, in, his, last, months, faur, struggled, to, complete, his, string, quartet, twenty, years, earlier, he, had, been, the, dedicatee, of, ravel, s, string, quartet, ravel, and, others, urged, faur, to, compose, one, of, his, own, he, refused, for, many, years, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, too, difficult, when, he, finally, decided, to, write, it, he, did, so, in, trepidation, telling, his, wife, i, ve, started, a, quartet, for, strings, without, piano, this, is, a, genre, which, beethoven, in, particular, made, famous, and, causes, all, those, who, are, not, beethoven, to, be, terrified, of, it, he, worked, on, the, piece, for, a, year, finishing, it, on, 11, september, 1924, less, than, two, months, before, he, died, working, long, hours, towards, the, end, to, complete, it, the, quartet, was, premiered, after, his, death, he, declined, an, offer, to, have, it, performed, privately, for, him, in, his, last, days, as, his, hearing, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, where, musical, sounds, were, horribly, distorted, in, his, ear, faur, died, in, paris, from, pneumonia, on, 4, november, 1924, at, the, age, of, 79, he, was, given, a, state, funeral, at, the, glise, de, la, madeleine, and, is, buried, in, the, passy, cemetery, in, paris, after, faur, s, death, the, conservatoire, abandoned, his, radicalism, and, became, resistant, to, new, trends, in, music, with, faur, s, own, harmonic, practice, being, held, up, as, the, farthest, limit, of, modernity, beyond, which, students, should, not, go, his, successor, henri, rabaud, director, of, the, conservatoire, from, 1922, to, 1941, declared, modernism, is, the, enemy, the, generation, of, students, born, between, the, wars, rejected, this, outdated, premise, turning, for, inspiration, to, bart, k, the, second, viennese, school, and, the, latest, works, of, stravinsky, in, a, centenary, tribute, in, 1945, the, musicologist, leslie, orrey, wrote, in, the, musical, times, more, profound, than, saint, sa, ns, more, varied, than, lalo, more, spontaneous, than, d, indy, more, classic, than, debussy, gabriel, faur, is, the, master, par, excellence, of, french, music, the, perfect, mirror, of, our, musical, genius, perhaps, when, english, musicians, get, to, know, his, work, better, these, words, of, roger, ducasse, will, seem, not, over, praise, but, no, more, than, his, due, aaron, copland, wrote, that, although, faur, s, works, can, be, divided, into, the, usual, early, middle, and, late, periods, there, is, no, such, radical, difference, between, his, first, and, last, manners, as, is, evident, with, many, other, composers, copland, found, premonitions, of, late, faur, in, even, the, earliest, works, and, traces, of, the, early, faur, in, the, works, of, his, old, age, the, themes, harmonies, form, have, remained, essentially, the, same, but, with, each, new, work, they, have, all, become, more, fresh, more, personal, more, profound, when, faur, was, born, berlioz, and, chopin, were, still, composing, the, latter, was, among, faur, s, early, influences, in, his, later, years, faur, developed, compositional, techniques, that, foreshadowed, the, atonal, music, of, schoenberg, and, later, still, drew, discreetly, on, the, techniques, of, jazz, duchen, writes, that, early, works, such, as, the, cantique, de, jean, racine, are, in, the, tradition, of, french, nineteenth, century, romanticism, yet, his, late, works, are, as, modern, as, any, of, the, works, of, his, pupils, influences, on, faur, particularly, in, his, early, work, included, not, only, chopin, but, mozart, and, schumann, the, authors, of, the, record, guide, 1955, sackville, west, and, shawe, taylor, wrote, that, faur, learnt, restraint, and, beauty, of, surface, from, mozart, tonal, freedom, and, long, melodic, lines, from, chopin, and, from, schumann, the, sudden, felicities, in, which, his, development, sections, abound, and, those, codas, in, which, whole, movements, are, briefly, but, magically, illuminated, his, work, was, based, on, the, strong, understanding, of, harmonic, structures, that, he, gained, at, the, cole, niedermeyer, from, niedermeyer, s, successor, gustave, lef, vre, lef, vre, wrote, the, book, trait, d, harmonie, paris, 1889, in, which, he, sets, out, a, harmonic, theory, that, differs, significantly, from, the, classical, theory, of, rameau, no, longer, outlawing, certain, chords, as, dissonant, by, using, unresolved, mild, discords, and, colouristic, effects, faur, anticipated, the, techniques, of, impressionist, composers, in, contrast, with, his, harmonic, and, melodic, style, which, pushed, the, bounds, for, his, time, faur, s, rhythmic, motives, tended, to, be, subtle, and, repetitive, with, little, to, break, the, flow, of, the, line, although, he, used, discreet, syncopations, similar, to, those, found, in, brahms, s, works, copland, referred, to, him, as, the, brahms, of, france, the, music, critic, jerry, dubins, suggests, that, faur, represents, the, link, between, the, late, german, romanticism, of, brahms, and, the, french, impressionism, of, debussy, to, sackville, west, and, shawe, taylor, faur, s, later, works, do, not, display, the, easy, charm, of, his, earlier, music, the, luscious, romantic, harmony, which, had, always, been, firmly, supported, by, a, single, tonality, later, gave, way, to, a, severely, monochrome, style, full, of, enharmonic, shifts, and, creating, the, impression, of, several, tonal, centres, simultaneously, employed, faur, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, masters, of, the, french, art, song, or, m, lodie, ravel, wrote, in, 1922, that, faur, had, saved, french, music, from, the, dominance, of, the, german, lied, two, years, later, the, critic, samuel, langford, wrote, of, faur, more, surely, almost, than, any, writer, in, the, world, he, commanded, the, faculty, to, create, a, song, all, of, a, piece, and, with, a, sustained, intensity, of, mood, which, made, it, like, a, single, thought, in, a, 2011, article, the, pianist, and, writer, roy, howat, and, the, musicologist, emily, kilpatrick, wrote, his, devotion, to, the, m, lodie, spans, his, career, from, the, ever, fresh, le, papillon, et, la, fleur, of, 1861, to, the, masterly, cycle, l, horizon, chim, rique, composed, sixty, years, and, more, than, a, hundred, songs, later, faur, s, songs, are, now, core, repertoire, for, students, and, professionals, sung, in, conservatories, and, recital, halls, throughout, the, world, in, copland, s, view, the, early, songs, written, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, under, the, influence, of, gounod, except, for, isolated, songs, such, as, apr, s, un, r, ve, or, au, bord, de, l, eau, show, little, sign, of, the, artist, to, come, with, the, second, volume, of, the, sixty, collected, songs, written, during, the, next, two, decades, copland, judged, came, the, first, mature, examples, of, the, real, faur, he, instanced, les, berceaux, les, roses, d, ispahan, and, especially, clair, de, lune, as, so, beautiful, so, perfect, that, they, have, even, penetrated, to, america, and, drew, attention, to, less, well, known, m, lodies, such, as, le, secret, nocturne, and, les, pr, sents, faur, also, composed, a, number, of, song, cycles, cinq, m, lodies, de, venise, op, 58, 1891, was, described, by, faur, as, a, novel, kind, of, song, suite, in, its, use, of, musical, themes, recurring, over, the, cycle, for, the, later, cycle, la, bonne, chanson, op, 61, 1894, there, were, five, such, themes, according, to, faur, he, also, wrote, that, la, bonne, chanson, was, his, most, spontaneous, composition, with, emma, bardac, singing, back, to, him, each, day, s, newly, written, material, among, later, works, were, cycles, drawn, from, the, poems, of, charles, van, lerberghe, la, chanson, d, ve, 1910, and, le, jardin, clos, 1914, the, requiem, op, 48, first, performed, in, 1888, was, not, composed, to, the, memory, of, a, specific, person, but, in, faur, s, words, for, the, pleasure, of, it, it, has, been, described, as, a, lullaby, of, death, because, of, its, predominantly, gentle, tone, faur, omitted, the, dies, irae, though, reference, to, the, day, of, judgment, appears, in, the, libera, me, which, like, verdi, he, added, to, the, normal, liturgical, text, faur, revised, the, requiem, over, the, years, and, a, number, of, different, performing, versions, are, now, in, use, from, the, earliest, for, small, forces, to, the, final, revision, with, full, orchestra, faur, s, operas, have, not, found, a, place, in, the, regular, repertoire, prom, th, e, is, the, more, neglected, of, the, two, with, only, a, handful, of, performances, in, more, than, a, century, copland, considered, p, n, lope, 1913, a, fascinating, work, and, one, of, the, best, operas, written, since, wagner, he, noted, however, that, the, music, is, as, a, whole, distinctly, non, theatrical, the, work, uses, leitmotifs, and, the, two, main, roles, call, for, voices, of, heroic, quality, but, these, are, the, only, ways, in, which, the, work, is, wagnerian, in, faur, s, late, style, tonality, is, stretched, hard, without, breaking, on, the, rare, occasions, when, the, piece, has, been, staged, critical, opinion, has, generally, praised, the, musical, quality, of, the, score, but, has, varied, as, to, the, dramatic, effectiveness, of, the, work, when, the, opera, was, first, presented, in, london, in, 1970, in, a, student, production, by, the, royal, academy, of, music, peter, heyworth, wrote, a, score, that, offers, rich, rewards, to, an, attentive, ear, can, none, the, less, fail, to, cut, much, ice, in, the, theatre, most, of, the, music, is, too, recessive, to, be, theatrically, effective, however, after, a, 2006, production, at, the, wexford, festival, ian, fox, wrote, faur, s, p, n, lope, is, a, true, rarity, and, although, some, lovely, music, was, anticipated, it, was, a, surprise, how, sure, the, composer, s, theatrical, touch, was, faur, s, major, sets, of, piano, works, are, thirteen, nocturnes, thirteen, barcarolles, six, impromptus, and, four, valses, caprices, these, sets, were, composed, across, the, decades, of, his, career, and, display, the, change, in, his, style, from, uncomplicated, youthful, charm, to, a, final, enigmatic, but, sometimes, fiery, introspection, by, way, of, a, turbulent, period, in, his, middle, years, his, other, notable, piano, pieces, including, shorter, works, or, collections, composed, or, published, as, a, set, are, romances, sans, paroles, ballade, in, f, major, mazurka, in, b, major, th, me, et, variations, in, c, minor, and, huit, pi, ces, br, ves, for, piano, duet, faur, composed, the, dolly, suite, and, together, with, his, friend, and, former, pupil, andr, messager, an, exuberant, parody, of, wagner, in, the, short, suite, souvenirs, de, bayreuth, the, piano, works, often, use, arpeggiated, figures, with, the, melody, interspersed, between, the, two, hands, and, include, finger, substitutions, natural, for, organists, these, aspects, make, them, daunting, for, some, pianists, even, a, virtuoso, like, liszt, said, that, he, found, faur, s, music, hard, to, play, the, early, piano, works, are, clearly, influenced, by, chopin, an, even, greater, influence, was, schumann, whose, piano, music, faur, loved, more, than, any, other, in, copland, s, view, it, was, with, the, sixth, nocturne, that, faur, fully, emerged, from, any, predecessor, s, shadow, the, pianist, alfred, cortot, said, there, are, few, pages, in, all, music, comparable, to, these, the, critic, bryce, morrison, has, noted, that, pianists, frequently, prefer, to, play, the, charming, earlier, piano, works, such, as, the, impromptu, no, 2, rather, than, the, later, piano, works, which, express, such, private, passion, and, isolation, such, alternating, anger, and, resignation, that, listeners, are, left, uneasy, in, his, piano, music, as, in, most, of, his, works, faur, shunned, virtuosity, in, favour, of, the, classical, lucidity, often, associated, with, the, french, he, was, unimpressed, by, purely, virtuoso, pianists, saying, the, greater, they, are, the, worse, they, play, me, faur, was, not, greatly, interested, in, orchestration, and, on, occasion, asked, his, former, students, such, as, jean, roger, ducasse, and, charles, koechlin, to, orchestrate, his, concert, and, theatre, works, in, nectoux, s, words, faur, s, generally, sober, orchestral, style, reflects, a, definite, aesthetic, attitude, the, idea, of, timbre, was, not, a, determining, one, in, faur, s, musical, thinking, he, was, not, attracted, by, flamboyant, combinations, of, tone, colours, which, he, thought, either, self, indulgent, or, a, disguise, for, lack, of, real, musical, invention, he, told, his, students, that, it, should, be, possible, to, produce, an, orchestration, without, resorting, to, glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, bells, or, electrical, instruments, debussy, admired, the, spareness, of, faur, s, orchestration, finding, in, it, the, transparency, he, strove, for, in, his, own, 1913, ballet, jeux, poulenc, by, contrast, described, faur, s, orchestration, as, a, leaden, overcoat, instrumental, mud, faur, s, best, known, orchestral, works, are, the, suites, masques, et, bergamasques, based, on, music, for, a, dramatic, entertainment, or, divertissement, comique, which, he, orchestrated, himself, dolly, orchestrated, by, henri, rabaud, and, pell, as, et, m, lisande, which, draws, on, incidental, music, for, maeterlinck, s, play, the, stage, version, was, orchestrated, by, koechlin, but, faur, himself, reworked, the, orchestration, for, the, published, suite, in, the, chamber, repertoire, his, two, piano, quartets, in, c, minor, and, g, minor, particularly, the, former, are, among, faur, s, better, known, works, his, other, chamber, music, includes, two, piano, quintets, two, cello, sonatas, two, violin, sonatas, a, piano, trio, and, a, string, quartet, copland, writing, in, 1924, before, the, string, quartet, was, finished, held, the, second, quintet, in, c, minor, opus, 115, to, be, faur, s, masterpiece, a, pure, well, of, spirituality, extremely, classic, as, far, removed, as, possible, from, the, romantic, temperament, other, critics, have, differed, somewhat, the, record, guide, commented, the, ceaseless, flow, and, restricted, colour, scheme, of, faur, s, last, manner, as, exemplified, in, this, quintet, need, very, careful, management, if, they, are, not, to, become, tedious, faur, s, last, work, the, string, quartet, has, been, described, by, critics, in, gramophone, magazine, as, an, intimate, meditation, on, the, last, things, and, an, extraordinary, work, by, any, standards, ethereal, and, other, worldly, with, themes, that, seem, constantly, to, be, drawn, skywards, faur, made, piano, rolls, of, his, music, for, several, companies, between, 1905, and, 1913, well, over, a, hundred, recordings, of, faur, s, music, were, made, between, 1898,

idiom, all, his, own, by, subtle, application, of, old, modes, he, evoked, the, aura, of, eternally, fresh, art, by, using, unresolved, mild, discords, and, special, coloristic, effects, he,

repertoire, faur, s, biographer, nectoux, writes, in, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, that, faur, is, widely, regarded, as, the, greatest, master, of, french, song, and, that, alongside, the, m, lodies, the, chamber, works, rank, as, faur, s, most, important, contribution, to, music, the, critic, robert, orledge, writes, his, genius, was, one, of, synthesis, he, reconciled,
