with, the, ritual, bedding, the, couple, s, longtime, failure, to, consummate, the, marriage, plagued, the, reputations, of, both, louis, auguste, and, marie, antoinette, for, the, next, seven, years, the, initial, reaction, to, the, marriage, between, marie, antoinette, and, louis, xvi, was, mixed, on, the, one, hand, the, dauphine, was, beautiful, personable, and, well, liked, by, the, common, people, her, first, official, appearance, in, paris, on, 8, june, 1773, was, a, resounding, success, on, the, other, hand, those, opposed, to, the, alliance, with, austria, had, a, difficult, relationship, with, marie, antoinette, as, did, others, who, disliked, her, for, more, personal, or, petty, reasons, madame, du, barry, proved, a, troublesome, foe, to, the, new, dauphine, she, was, louis, xv, s, mistress, and, had, considerable, political, influence, over, him, in, 1770, she, was, instrumental, in, ousting, tienne, fran, ois, duc, de, choiseul, who, had, helped, orchestrate, the, franco, austrian, alliance, and, marie, antoinette, s, marriage, and, in, exiling, his, sister, the, duchess, of, gramont, one, of, marie, antoinette, s, ladies, in, waiting, marie, antoinette, was, persuaded, by, her, husband, s, aunts, to, refuse, to, acknowledge, du, barry, which, some, saw, as, a, political, blunder, that, jeopardized, austria, s, interests, at, the, french, court, marie, antoinette, s, mother, and, the, austrian, ambassador, to, france, comte, de, mercy, argenteau, who, sent, the, empress, secret, reports, on, marie, antoinette, s, behaviour, pressured, marie, antoinette, to, speak, to, madame, du, barry, which, she, grudgingly, agreed, to, do, on, new, year, s, day, 1772, she, merely, commented, to, her, there, are, a, lot, of, people, at, versailles, today, but, it, was, enough, for, madame, du, barry, who, was, satisfied, with, this, recognition, and, the, crisis, passed, two, days, after, the, death, of, louis, xv, in, 1774, louis, xvi, exiled, du, barry, to, the, abbaye, du, pont, aux, dames, in, meaux, pleasing, both, his, wife, and, aunts, two, and, a, half, years, later, at, the, end, of, october, 1776, madame, du, barry, s, exile, ended, and, she, was, allowed, to, return, to, her, beloved, ch, teau, at, louveciennes, but, she, was, never, permitted, to, return, to, versailles, on, 10, may, 1774, upon, the, death, of, louis, xv, the, dauphin, ascended, the, throne, as, king, louis, xvi, of, france, and, navarre, with, marie, antoinette, as, his, queen, consort, at, the, outset, the, new, queen, had, limited, political, influence, with, her, husband, who, with, the, support, of, his, two, most, important, ministers, chief, minister, maurepas, and, foreign, minister, vergennes, blocked, several, of, her, candidates, from, assuming, important, positions, including, choiseul, the, queen, did, play, a, decisive, role, in, the, disgrace, and, exile, of, the, most, powerful, of, louis, xv, s, ministers, the, duc, d, aiguillon, on, 24, may, 1774, two, weeks, after, the, death, of, louis, xv, the, king, gave, his, wife, the, petit, trianon, a, small, ch, teau, on, the, grounds, of, versailles, that, had, been, built, by, louis, xv, for, his, mistress, madame, de, pompadour, louis, xvi, allowed, marie, antoinette, to, renovate, it, to, suit, her, own, tastes, soon, rumours, circulated, that, she, had, plastered, the, walls, with, gold, and, diamonds, the, queen, spent, heavily, on, fashion, luxuries, and, gambling, though, the, country, was, facing, a, grave, financial, crisis, and, the, population, was, suffering, rose, bertin, created, dresses, for, her, and, hairstyles, such, as, poufs, up, to, three, feet, 90, cm, high, and, the, panache, a, spray, of, feather, plumes, she, and, her, court, also, adopted, the, english, fashion, of, dresses, made, of, indienne, a, material, banned, in, france, from, 1686, until, 1759, to, protect, local, french, woolen, and, silk, industries, percale, and, muslin, as, a, result, of, all, these, fashion, activities, marie, antoinette, presided, over, one, of, the, most, important, and, fashionable, courts, in, history, and, she, was, dominant, over, all, of, the, other, ladies, of, the, court, as, for, her, bearing, and, appearance, the, queen, was, very, majestic, and, charismatic, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, she, gained, much, weight, over, the, years, due, to, her, many, pregnancies, by, the, time, of, the, flour, war, of, 1775, a, series, of, riots, due, to, the, high, price, of, flour, and, bread, had, damaged, her, reputation, among, the, general, public, eventually, marie, antoinette, s, reputation, was, no, better, than, that, of, the, favourites, of, previous, kings, many, french, people, were, beginning, to, blame, her, for, the, degrading, economic, situation, suggesting, the, country, s, inability, to, pay, off, its, debt, was, the, result, of, her, wasting, the, crown, s, money, in, her, correspondence, marie, antoinette, s, mother, maria, theresa, expressed, concern, over, her, daughter, s, spending, habits, citing, the, civil, unrest, it, was, beginning, to, cause, as, early, as, 1774, marie, antoinette, had, begun, to, befriend, some, of, her, male, admirers, such, as, the, baron, de, besenval, the, duc, de, coigny, and, count, valentin, esterh, zy, and, also, formed, deep, friendships, with, various, ladies, at, court, most, noted, was, marie, louise, princesse, de, lamballe, related, to, the, royal, family, through, her, marriage, into, the, penthi, vre, family, on, 19, september, 1774, she, appointed, her, superintendent, of, her, household, an, appointment, she, soon, transferred, to, her, new, favourite, the, duchess, of, polignac, in, 1774, she, took, under, her, patronage, her, former, music, teacher, the, german, opera, composer, christoph, willibald, gluck, who, remained, in, france, until, 1779, amidst, the, atmosphere, of, a, wave, of, libelles, the, holy, roman, emperor, joseph, ii, came, to, france, incognito, using, the, name, comte, de, falkenstein, for, a, six, week, visit, during, which, he, toured, paris, extensively, and, was, a, guest, at, versailles, he, met, his, sister, and, her, husband, on, 18, april, 1777, at, the, ch, teau, de, la, muette, and, spoke, frankly, to, his, brother, in, law, curious, as, to, why, the, royal, marriage, had, not, been, consummated, arriving, at, the, conclusion, that, no, obstacle, to, the, couple, s, conjugal, relations, existed, save, the, queen, s, lack, of, interest, and, the, king, s, unwillingness, to, exert, himself, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, leopold, grand, duke, of, tuscany, joseph, ii, described, them, as, a, couple, of, complete, blunderers, he, disclosed, to, leopold, that, the, inexperienced, then, still, only, 22, year, old, louis, xvi, had, confided, in, him, the, course, of, action, he, had, been, undertaking, in, their, marital, bed, saying, louis, xvi, introduces, the, member, but, then, stays, there, without, moving, for, about, two, minutes, withdraws, without, having, completed, the, act, and, bids, goodnight, suggestions, that, louis, suffered, from, phimosis, which, was, relieved, by, circumcision, have, been, discredited, nevertheless, following, joseph, s, intervention, the, marriage, was, finally, consummated, in, august, 1777, eight, months, later, in, april, 1778, it, was, suspected, that, the, queen, was, pregnant, which, was, officially, announced, on, 16, may, marie, antoinette, s, daughter, marie, th, r, se, charlotte, madame, royale, was, born, at, versailles, on, 19, december, 1778, the, child, s, paternity, was, contested, in, the, libelles, as, were, all, her, children, s, in, the, middle, of, the, queen, s, pregnancy, two, events, occurred, which, had, a, profound, effect, on, her, later, life, the, return, of, her, friend, the, swedish, diplomat, count, axel, von, fersen, the, younger, to, versailles, for, two, years, and, her, brother, s, claim, to, the, throne, of, bavaria, contested, by, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, prussia, marie, antoinette, pleaded, with, her, husband, for, the, french, to, intercede, on, behalf, of, austria, the, peace, of, teschen, signed, on, 13, may, 1779, ended, the, brief, conflict, with, the, queen, imposing, french, mediation, at, her, mother, s, insistence, and, austria, s, gaining, the, innviertel, territory, of, at, least, 100, 000, inhabitants, a, strong, retreat, from, the, early, french, position, which, was, hostile, towards, austria, this, gave, the, impression, partially, justified, that, the, queen, had, sided, with, austria, against, france, meanwhile, the, queen, began, to, institute, changes, in, court, customs, some, of, them, met, with, the, disapproval, of, the, older, generation, such, as, the, abandonment, of, heavy, make, up, and, the, popular, wide, hooped, panniers, the, new, fashion, called, for, a, simpler, feminine, look, typified, first, by, the, rustic, robe, la, polonaise, style, and, later, by, the, gaulle, a, layered, muslin, dress, marie, antoinette, wore, in, a, 1783, vig, e, le, brun, portrait, in, 1780, she, began, to, participate, in, amateur, plays, and, musicals, in, the, th, tre, de, la, reine, built, for, her, by, richard, mique, repayment, of, the, french, debt, remained, a, difficult, problem, further, exacerbated, by, vergennes, and, also, by, marie, antoinette, prodding, louis, xvi, to, involve, france, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, primary, motive, for, the, queen, s, involvement, in, political, affairs, in, this, period, may, arguably, have, had, more, to, do, with, court, factionalism, than, any, true, interest, on, her, part, in, politics, themselves, but, she, played, an, important, role, in, aiding, the, american, revolution, by, securing, austrian, and, russian, support, for, france, which, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, the, first, league, of, armed, neutrality, that, stopped, britain, s, attack, and, by, weighing, in, decisively, for, the, nomination, of, philippe, henri, marquis, de, s, gur, as, minister, of, war, and, charles, eug, ne, gabriel, de, la, croix, as, secretary, of, the, navy, in, 1780, who, helped, george, washington, defeat, the, british, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, which, ended, in, 1783, marie, antoinette, s, second, pregnancy, ended, in, a, miscarriage, early, in, july, 1779, as, confirmed, by, letters, between, the, queen, and, her, mother, although, some, historians, believed, that, she, may, have, experienced, bleeding, related, to, an, irregular, menstrual, cycle, which, she, mistook, for, a, lost, pregnancy, her, third, pregnancy, was, affirmed, in, march, 1781, and, on, 22, october, she, gave, birth, to, louis, joseph, xavier, fran, ois, dauphin, of, france, empress, maria, theresa, died, on, 29, november, 1780, in, vienna, marie, antoinette, feared, that, the, death, of, her, mother, would, jeopardise, the, franco, austrian, alliance, as, well, as, ultimately, herself, but, her, brother, joseph, ii, holy, roman, emperor, wrote, to, her, that, he, had, no, intention, of, breaking, the, alliance, a, second, visit, from, joseph, ii, which, took, place, in, july, 1781, to, reaffirm, the, franco, austrian, alliance, and, also, to, see, his, sister, was, tainted, by, false, rumours, that, marie, antoinette, was, sending, money, to, him, from, the, french, treasury, despite, the, general, celebration, over, the, birth, of, an, heir, marie, antoinette, s, political, influence, such, as, it, was, was, perceived, to, greatly, benefit, austria, during, the, kettle, war, in, which, her, brother, joseph, attempted, to, open, the, scheldt, river, for, naval, passage, marie, antoinette, succeeded, in, obliging, vergennes, to, pay, huge, financial, compensation, to, austria, finally, the, queen, was, able, to, obtain, her, brother, s, support, against, great, britain, in, the, american, revolution, and, she, neutralized, french, hostility, to, his, alliance, with, russia, in, 1782, after, the, governess, of, the, royal, children, the, princesse, de, gu, m, n, went, bankrupt, and, resigned, marie, antoinette, appointed, her, favourite, the, duchess, of, polignac, to, the, position, this, decision, met, with, disapproval, from, the, court, as, the, duchess, was, considered, to, be, of, too, modest, origins, to, occupy, such, an, exalted, position, in, contrast, both, the, king, and, the, queen, trusted, madame, de, polignac, completely, gave, her, a, thirteen, room, apartment, in, versailles, and, paid, her, well, the, entire, polignac, family, benefited, greatly, from, royal, favour, in, titles, and, positions, but, its, sudden, wealth, and, lavish, lifestyle, outraged, most, aristocratic, families, who, resented, the, polignacs, dominance, at, court, and, also, fueled, the, increasing, popular, disapproval, of, marie, antoinette, mostly, in, paris, de, mercy, wrote, to, the, empress, it, is, almost, unexampled, that, in, so, short, a, time, the, royal, favour, should, have, brought, such, overwhelming, advantages, to, a, family, in, june, 1783, marie, antoinette, s, new, pregnancy, was, announced, but, on, the, night, of, 1, 2, november, her, 28th, birthday, she, suffered, a, miscarriage, in, 1783, the, queen, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, nomination, of, charles, alexandre, de, calonne, a, close, friend, of, the, polignacs, as, controller, general, of, finances, and, of, the, baron, de, breteuil, as, the, minister, of, the, royal, household, making, him, perhaps, the, strongest, and, most, conservative, minister, of, the, reign, the, result, of, these, two, nominations, was, that, marie, antoinette, s, influence, became, paramount, in, government, and, the, new, ministers, rejected, any, major, change, to, the, structure, of, the, old, regime, more, than, that, the, decree, by, de, s, gur, the, minister, of, war, requiring, four, quarterings, of, nobility, as, a, condition, for, the, appointment, of, officers, mainly, served, the, interest, of, older, noble, families, including, poorer, provincial, ones, who, were, widely, seen, as, a, reactionary, interest, group, by, ambitious, members, of, the, middle, and, professional, classes, by, some, more, recent, nobility, and, even, by, the, parisian, populace, and, press, the, measure, also, blocked, the, access, of, commoners, mainly, sons, of, members, of, the, professional, classes, and, of, more, recently, elevated, nobility, to, important, positions, in, the, armed, forces, as, such, the, decree, became, an, important, grievance, for, social, classes, that, had, been, habitually, supportive, of, the, monarchy, and, established, order, and, which, went, on, to, supply, the, bulk, of, the, early, leadership, of, the, french, revolution, count, axel, von, fersen, after, his, return, from, america, in, june, 1783, was, accepted, into, the, queen, s, private, society, there, were, claims, that, the, two, were, romantically, involved, but, since, most, of, their, correspondence, has, been, lost, destroyed, or, redacted, for, many, years, there, was, no, conclusive, evidence, however, in, 2016, the, daily, telegraph, s, henry, samuel, announced, that, researchers, at, the, centre, for, research, and, restoration, of, museums, of, frances, crcc, using, cutting, edge, x, ray, and, different, infrared, scanners, had, deciphered, letters, from, her, that, proved, the, affair, around, this, time, pamphlets, describing, farcical, sexual, deviance, including, the, queen, and, her, friends, in, the, court, were, growing, in, popularity, around, the, country, the, portefeuille, d, un, talon, rouge, was, one, of, the, earliest, including, the, queen, and, a, variety, of, other, nobles, in, a, political, statement, decrying, the, immoral, practices, of, the, court, as, time, went, on, these, came, to, focus, more, on, the, queen, they, described, amorous, encounters, with, a, wide, range, of, figures, from, the, duchess, of, polignac, to, louis, xv, as, these, attacks, increased, they, were, connected, with, the, public, s, dislike, of, her, association, with, the, rival, nation, of, austria, it, was, publicly, suggested, that, her, supposed, behaviour, was, learned, at, the, austrian, court, particularly, lesbianism, which, was, known, as, the, german, vice, her, mother, again, expressed, concern, for, the, safety, of, her, daughter, and, she, began, to, use, austria, s, ambassador, to, france, comte, de, mercy, to, provide, information, on, marie, antoinette, s, safety, and, movements, in, 1783, the, queen, was, busy, with, the, creation, of, her, hamlet, a, rustic, retreat, built, by, her, favoured, architect, richard, mique, according, to, the, designs, of, the, painter, hubert, robert, its, creation, however, caused, another, uproar, when, its, cost, became, widely, known, however, the, hamlet, was, not, an, eccentricity, of, marie, antoinette, s, it, was, en, vogue, at, the, time, for, nobles, to, have, recreations, of, small, villages, on, their, properties, in, fact, the, design, was, copied, from, that, of, louis, joseph, prince, of, cond, it, was, also, significantly, smaller, and, less, intricate, than, many, other, nobles, around, this, time, she, accumulated, a, library, of, 5, 000, books, those, on, music, often, dedicated, to, her, were, the, most, read, though, she, also, liked, to, read, history, she, sponsored, the, arts, in, particular, music, marie, antoinette, preferred, to, hold, her, musicales, in, the, salon, of, her, petit, appartement, de, la, reine, in, the, palace, of, versailles, or, in, the, th, tre, de, la, reine, she, limited, the, audience, to, her, intimate, circle, and, a, few, musicians, among, them, the, chevalier, de, saint, georges, admitted, to, perform, music, with, the, queen, saint, georges, probably, played, his, violin, sonatas, for, two, instruments, with, her, majesty, playing, the, fortepiano, she, also, supported, some, scientific, endeavours, encouraging, and, witnessing, the, first, launch, of, a, montgolfi, re, a, hot, air, balloon, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, this, extraordinary, feat, which, represented, a, turning, point, in, human, civilization, was, done, by, jean, fran, ois, pil, tre, de, rozier, on, 27, april, 1784, pierre, beaumarchais, s, play, the, marriage, of, figaro, premiered, in, paris, initially, banned, by, the, king, due, to, its, negative, portrayal, of, the, nobility, the, play, was, finally, allowed, to, be, publicly, performed, because, of, the, queen, s, support, and, its, overwhelming, popularity, at, court, where, secret, readings, of, it, had, been, given, by, marie, antoinette, the, play, was, a, disaster, for, the, image, of, the, monarchy, and, aristocracy, it, inspired, mozart, s, the, marriage, of, figaro, which, premiered, in, vienna, on, 1, may, 1786, on, 24, october, 1784, putting, the, baron, de, breteuil, in, charge, of, its, acquisition, louis, xvi, bought, the, ch, teau, de, saint, cloud, from, louis, philippe, i, duke, of, orl, ans, in, the, name, of, his, wife, which, she, wanted, due, to, their, expanding, family, she, wanted, to, be, able, to, own, her, own, property, one, that, was, actually, hers, to, then, have, the, authority, to, bequeath, it, to, whichever, of, my, children, i, wish, choosing, the, child, she, thought, could, use, it, rather, than, it, going, through, patriarchal, inheritance, laws, or, whims, it, was, proposed, that, the, cost, could, be, covered, by, other, sales, such, as, that, of, the, ch, teau, trompette, in, bordeaux, this, was, unpopular, particularly, with, those, factions, of, the, nobility, who, disliked, the, queen, but, also, with, a, growing, percentage, of, the, population, who, disapproved, of, a, queen, of, france, independently, owning, a, private, residence, the, purchase, of, saint, cloud, thus, damaged, the, public, s, image, of, the, queen, even, further, the, ch, teau, s, high, price, almost, 6, million, livres, plus, the, substantial, extra, cost, of, redecorating, ensured, that, much, less, money, was, going, towards, repaying, france, s, substantial, debt, on, 27, march, 1785, marie, antoinette, gave, birth, to, a, second, son, louis, charles, who, bore, the, title, of, duke, of, normandy, the, fact, that, the, birth, occurred, exactly, nine, months, after, fersen, s, return, did, not, escape, the, attention, of, many, leading, to, doubt, as, to, the, parentage, of, the, child, and, to, a, noticeable, decline, of, the, queen, s, reputation, in, public, opinion, the, majority, of, marie, antoinette, s, and, louis, xvii, s, biographers, believe, that, the, young, prince, was, the, biological, son, of, louis, xvi, including, stefan, zweig, and, antonia, fraser, who, believe, that, fersen, and, marie, antoinette, were, indeed, romantically, involved, fraser, has, also, noted, that, the, birthdate, matches, up, perfectly, with, a, known, conjugal, visit, from, the, king, courtiers, at, versailles, noted, in, their, diaries, that, the, date, of, the, child, s, conception, corresponded, perfectly, with, a, period, when, the, king, and, the, queen, had, spent, much, time, together, but, these, details, were, ignored, amid, attacks, on, the, queen, s, character, these, suspicions, of, illegitimacy, along, with, the, continued, publication, of, the, libelles, and, never, ending, cavalcades, of, court, intrigues, the, actions, of, joseph, ii, in, the, kettle, war, the, purchase, of, saint, cloud, and, the, affair, of, the, diamond, necklace, combined, to, turn, popular, opinion, sharply, against, the, queen, and, the, image, of, a, licentious, spendthrift, empty, headed, foreign, queen, was, quickly, taking, root, in, the, french, psyche, a, second, daughter, her, last, child, marie, sophie, h, l, ne, b, atrix, madame, sophie, was, born, on, 9, july, 1786, and, lived, only, eleven, months, until, 19, june, 1787, she, was, named, after, the, king, s, aunt, princess, sophie, of, france, marie, antoinette, began, to, abandon, her, more, carefree, activities, to, become, increasingly, involved, in, politics, in, her, role, as, queen, of, france, by, publicly, showing, her, attention, to, the, education, and, care, of, her, children, the, queen, sought, to, improve, the, dissolute, image, she, had, acquired, in, 1785, from, the, diamond, necklace, affair, in, which, public, opinion, had, falsely, accused, her, of, criminal, participation, in, defrauding, the, jewelers, boehmer, and, bassenge, of, the, price, of, an, expensive, diamond, necklace, they, had, originally, created, for, madame, du, barry, the, main, actors, in, the, scandal, were, cardinal, de, rohan, prince, de, rohan, gu, m, n, grand, almoner, of, france, and, jeanne, de, valois, saint, r, my, countess, de, la, motte, a, descendant, of, an, illegitimate, child, of, henry, ii, of, france, of, the, house, of, valois, marie, antoinette, had, profoundly, disliked, rohan, since, the, time, he, had, been, the, french, ambassador, to, vienna, when, she, was, a, child, despite, his, high, clerical, position, at, the, court, she, never, addressed, a, word, to, him, others, involved, were, nicole, lequay, alias, baronne, d, oliva, a, prostitute, who, happened, to, look, like, marie, antoinette, r, taux, de, villette, a, forger, alessandro, cagliostro, an, italian, adventurer, and, the, count, de, la, motte, jeanne, de, valois, husband, madame, de, la, motte, tricked, rohan, into, buying, the, necklace, as, a, gift, to, marie, antoinette, for, him, to, gain, the, queen, s, favour, when, the, affair, was, discovered, those, involved, except, de, la, motte, and, r, taux, de, villette, who, both, managed, to, flee, were, arrested, tried, convicted, and, either, imprisoned, or, exiled, madame, de, la, motte, was, sentenced, for, life, to, confinement, in, the, piti, salp, tri, re, hospital, which, also, served, as, a, prison, for, women, judged, by, the, parlement, of, paris, rohan, was, found, innocent, of, any, wrongdoing, and, allowed, to, leave, the, bastille, marie, antoinette, who, had, insisted, on, the, arrest, of, the, cardinal, was, dealt, a, heavy, personal, blow, as, was, the, monarchy, and, despite, the, fact, that, the, guilty, parties, were, tried, and, convicted, the, affair, proved, to, be, extremely, damaging, to, her, reputation, which, never, recovered, from, it, suffering, from, an, acute, case, of, depression, the, king, began, to, seek, the, advice, of, his, wife, in, her, new, role, and, with, increasing, political, power, the, queen, tried, to, improve, the, awkward, situation, brewing, between, the, parlement, and, the, king, this, change, of, the, queen, s, position, signaled, the, end, of, the, polignacs, influence, and, their, impact, on, the, finances, of, the, crown, continuing, deterioration, of, the, financial, situation, despite, cutbacks, to, the, royal, retinue, and, court, expenses, ultimately, forced, the, king, the, queen, and, the, controller, general, of, finances, charles, alexandre, de, calonne, at, the, urging, of, vergennes, to, call, a, session, of, the, assembly, of, notables, after, a, hiatus, of, 160, years, the, assembly, was, held, for, the, purpose, of, initiating, necessary, financial, reforms, but, the, assembly, refused, to, cooperate, the, first, meeting, took, place, on, 22, february, 1787, nine, days, after, the, death, of, vergennes, on, 13, february, marie, antoinette, did, not, attend, the, meeting, and, her, absence, resulted, in, accusations, that, the, queen, was, trying, to, undermine, its, purpose, the, assembly, was, a, failure, it, did, not, pass, any, reforms, and, instead, fell, into, a, pattern, of, defying, the, king, on, the, urging, of, the, queen, louis, xvi, dismissed, calonne, on, 8, april, 1787, on, 1, may, 1787, tienne, charles, de, lom, nie, de, brienne, archbishop, of, toulouse, and, one, of, the, queen, s, political, allies, was, appointed, by, the, king, at, her, urging, to, replace, calonne, first, as, controller, general, of, finances, and, then, as, chief, minister, he, began, to, institute, more, cutbacks, at, court, while, trying, to, restore, the, royal, absolute, power, weakened, by, the, parlement, brienne, was, unable, to, improve, the, financial, situation, and, since, he, was, the, queen, s, ally, this, failure, adversely, affected, her, political, position, the, continued, poor, financial, climate, of, the, country, resulted, in, the, 25, may, dissolution, of, the, assembly, of, notables, because, of, its, inability, to, function, and, the, lack, of, solutions, was, blamed, on, the, queen, france, s, financial, problems, were, the, result, of, a, combination, of, factors, several, expensive, wars, a, large, royal, family, whose, expenditures, were, paid, for, by, the, state, and, an, unwillingness, on, the, part, of, most, members, of, the, privileged, classes, aristocracy, and, clergy, to, help, defray, the, costs, of, the, government, out, of, their, own, pockets, by, relinquishing, some, of, their, financial, privileges, as, a, result, of, the, public, perception, that, she, had, single, handedly, ruined, the, national, finances, marie, antoinette, was, given, the, nickname, of, madame, d, ficit, in, the, summer, of, 1787, while, the, sole, fault, for, the, financial, crisis, did, not, lie, with, her, marie, antoinette, was, the, biggest, obstacle, to, any, major, reform, effort, she, had, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, disgrace, of, the, reformer, ministers, of, finance, anne, robert, jacques, turgot, in, 1776, and, jacques, necker, first, dismissal, in, 1781, if, the, secret, expenses, of, the, queen, were, taken, into, account, court, expenses, were, much, higher, than, the, official, estimate, of, 7, of, the, state, budget, the, queen, attempted, to, fight, back, with, propaganda, portraying, her, as, a, caring, mother, most, notably, in, the, painting, by, lisabeth, vig, e, le, brun, exhibited, at, the, royal, acad, mie, salon, de, paris, in, august, 1787, showing, her, with, her, children, around, the, same, time, jeanne, de, valois, saint, r, my, escaped, from, prison, and, fled, to, london, where, she, published, damaging, slander, concerning, her, supposed, amorous, affair, with, the, queen, the, political, situation, in, 1787, worsened, when, at, marie, antoinette, s, urging, the, parlement, of, paris, was, exiled, to, troyes, on, 15, august, it, further, deteriorated, when, louis, xvi, tried, to, use, a, lit, de, justice, on, 11, november, to, impose, legislation, the, new, duke, of, orl, ans, publicly, protested, the, king, s, actions, and, was, subsequently, exiled, to, his, ch, teau, de, villers, cotter, ts, the, may, edicts, issued, on, 8, may, 1788, were, also, opposed, by, the, public, and, parlement, finally, on, 8, august, louis, xvi, announced, his, intention, to, bring, back, the, estates, general, the, traditional, elected, legislature, of, the, country, which, had, not, been, convened, since, 1614, while, from, late, 1787, up, to, his, death, in, june, 1789, marie, antoinette, s, primary, concern, was, the, continued, deterioration, of, the, health, of, the, dauphin, who, suffered, from, tuberculosis, she, was, directly, involved, in, the, exile, of, the, parlement, the, may, edicts, and, the, announcement, regarding, the, estates, general, she, did, participate, in, the, king, council, the, first, queen, to, do, this, in, over, 175, years, since, marie, de, medici, had, been, named, chef, du, conseil, du, roi, between, 1614, and, 1617, and, she, was, making, the, major, decisions, behind, the, scene, and, in, the, royal, council, marie, antoinette, was, instrumental, in, the, reinstatement, of, jacques, necker, as, finance, minister, on, 26, august, 1788, a, popular, move, even, though, she, herself, was, worried, that, it, would, go, against, her, if, necker, proved, unsuccessful, in, reforming, the, country, s, finances, she, accepted, necker, s, proposition, to, double, the, representation, of, the, third, estate, tiers, tat, in, an, attempt, to, check, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, on, the, eve, of, the, opening, of, the, estates, general, the, queen, attended, the, mass, celebrating, its, return, as, soon, as, it, opened, on, 5, may, 1789, the, fracture, between, the, democratic, third, estate, consisting, of, bourgeois, and, radical, aristocrats, and, the, conservative, nobility, of, the, second, estate, widened, and, marie, antoinette, knew, that, her, rival, the, duke, of, orl, ans, who, had, given, money, and, bread, to, the, people, during, the, winter, would, be, acclaimed, by, the, crowd, much, to, her, detriment, the, death, of, the, dauphin, on, 4, june, which, deeply, affected, his, parents, was, virtually, ignored, by, the, french, people, who, were, instead, preparing, for, the, next, meeting, of, the, estates, general, and, hoping, for, a, resolution, to, the, bread, crisis, as, the, third, estate, declared, itself, a, national, assembly, and, took, the, tennis, court, oath, and, as, people, either, spread, or, believed, rumours, that, the, queen, wished, to, bathe, in, their, blood, marie, antoinette, went, into, mourning, for, her, eldest, son, her, role, was, decisive, in, urging, the, king, to, remain, firm, and, not, concede, to, popular, demands, for, reforms, in, addition, she, showed, her, determination, to, use, force, to, crush, the, forthcoming, revolution, the, situation, escalated, on, 20, june, as, the, third, estate, which, had, been, joined, by, several, members, of, the, clergy, and, radical, nobility, found, the, door, to, its, appointed, meeting, place, closed, by, order, of, the, king, it, thus, met, at, the, tennis, court, in, versailles, and, took, the, tennis, court, oath, not, to, separate, before, it, had, given, a, constitution, to, the, nation, on, 11, july, at, marie, antoinette, s, urging, necker, was, dismissed, and, replaced, by, breteuil, the, queen, s, choice, to, crush, the, revolution, with, mercenary, swiss, troops, under, the, command, of, one, of, her, favorites, pierre, victor, baron, de, besenval, de, br, nstatt, at, the, news, paris, was, besieged, by, riots, that, culminated, in, the, storming, of, the, bastille, on, 14, july, on, 15, july, gilbert, du, motier, marquis, de, lafayette, was, named, commander, in, chief, of, the, newly, formed, national, guard, in, the, days, following, the, storming, of, the, bastille, for, fear, of, assassination, and, ordered, by, the, king, the, emigration, of, members, of, the, high, aristocracy, began, on, 17, july, with, the, departure, of, the, count, of, artois, the, cond, s, cousins, of, the, king, and, the, unpopular, polignacs, marie, antoinette, whose, life, was, as, much, in, danger, remained, with, the, king, whose, power, was, gradually, being, taken, away, by, the, national, constituent, assembly, the, abolition, of, feudal, privileges, by, the, national, constituent, assembly, on, 4, august, 1789, and, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, la, d, claration, des, droits, de, l, homme, et, du, citoyen, drafted, by, lafayette, with, the, help, of, thomas, jefferson, and, adopted, on, 26, august, paved, the, way, to, a, constitutional, monarchy, 4, september, 1791, 21, september, 1792, despite, these, dramatic, changes, life, at, the, court, continued, while, the, situation, in, paris, was, becoming, critical, because, of, bread, shortages, in, september, on, 5, october, a, crowd, from, paris, descended, upon, versailles, and, forced, the, royal, family, to, move, to, the, tuileries, palace, in, paris, where, they, lived, under, a, form, of, house, arrest, under, the, watch, of, lafayette, s, national, guard, while, the, count, of, provence, and, his, wife, were, allowed, to, reside, in, the, petit, luxembourg, where, they, remained, until, they, went, into, exile, on, 20, june, 1791, marie, antoinette, continued, to, perform, charitable, functions, and, attend, religious, ceremonies, but, dedicated, most, of, her, time, to, her, children, she, also, played, an, important, political, albeit, not, public, role, between, 1789, and, 1791, when, she, had, a, complex, set, of, relationships, with, several, key, actors, of, the, early, period, of, the, french, revolution, one, of, the, most, important, was, necker, the, prime, minister, of, finances, premier, ministre, des, finances, despite, her, dislike, of, him, she, played, a, decisive, role, in, his, return, to, the, office, she, blamed, him, for, his, support, of, the, revolution, and, did, not, regret, his, resignation, in, 1790, lafayette, one, of, the, former, military, leaders, in, the, american, war, of, independence, 1775, 1783, served, as, the, warden, of, the, royal, family, in, his, position, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, national, guard, despite, his, dislike, of, the, queen, he, detested, her, as, much, as, she, detested, him, and, at, one, time, had, even, threatened, to, send, her, to, a, convent, he, was, persuaded, by, the, mayor, of, paris, jean, sylvain, bailly, to, work, and, collaborate, with, her, and, allowed, her, to, see, fersen, a, number, of, times, he, even, went, as, far, as, exiling, the, duke, of, orl, ans, who, was, accused, by, the, queen, of, fomenting, trouble, his, relationship, with, the, king, was, more, cordial, as, a, liberal, aristocrat, he, did, not, want, the, fall, of, the, monarchy, but, rather, the, establishment, of, a, liberal, one, similar, to, that, of, great, britain, based, on, cooperation, between, the, king, and, the, people, as, was, to, be, defined, in, the, constitution, of, 1791, despite, her, attempts, to, remain, out, of, the, public, eye, marie, antoinette, was, falsely, accused, in, the, libelles, of, having, an, affair, with, lafayette, whom, she, loathed, and, as, was, published, in, le, godmich, royal, the, royal, dildo, of, having, a, sexual, relationship, with, the, english, baroness, lady, sophie, farrell, of, bournemouth, a, well, known, lesbian, of, the, time, publication, of, such, calumnies, continued, to, the, end, climaxing, at, her, trial, with, an, accusation, of, incest, with, her, son, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, accusations, a, significant, achievement, of, marie, antoinette, in, that, period, was, the, establishment, of, an, alliance, with, honor, gabriel, riqueti, comte, de, mirabeau, the, most, important, lawmaker, in, the, assembly, like, lafayette, mirabeau, was, a, liberal, aristocrat, he, had, joined, the, third, estate, and, was, not, against, the, monarchy, but, wanted, to, reconcile, it, with, the, revolution, he, also, wanted, to, be, a, minister, and, was, not, immune, to, corruption, on, the, advice, of, mercy, marie, antoinette, opened, secret, negotiations, with, him, and, both, agreed, to, meet, privately, at, the, ch, teau, de, saint, cloud, on, 3, july, 1790, where, the, royal, family, was, allowed, to, spend, the, summer, free, of, the, radical, elements, who, watched, their, every, move, in, paris, at, the, meeting, mirabeau, was, much, impressed, by, the, queen, and, remarked, in, a, letter, to, auguste, marie, raymond, d, arenberg, comte, de, la, marck, that, she, was, the, only, person, the, king, had, by, him, la, reine, est, le, seul, homme, que, le, roi, ait, aupr, s, de, lui, an, agreement, was, reached, turning, mirabeau, into, one, of, her, political, allies, marie, antoinette, promised, to, pay, him, 6000, livres, per, month, and, one, million, if, he, succeeded, in, his, mission, to, restore, the, king, s, authority, the, only, time, the, royal, couple, returned, to, paris, in, that, period, was, on, 14, july, to, attend, the, f, te, de, la, f, d, ration, an, official, ceremony, held, at, the, champ, de, mars, in, commemoration, of, the, fall, of, the, bastille, one, year, earlier, at, least, 300, 000, persons, participated, from, all, over, france, including, 18, 000, national, guards, with, talleyrand, bishop, of, autun, celebrating, a, mass, at, the, autel, de, la, patrie, altar, of, the, fatherland, the, king, was, greeted, at, the, event, with, loud, cheers, of, long, live, the, king, especially, when, he, took, the, oath, to, protect, the, nation, and, to, enforce, the, laws, voted, by, the, constitutional, assembly, there, were, even, cheers, for, the, queen, particularly, when, she, presented, the, dauphin, to, the, public, mirabeau, sincerely, wanted, to, reconcile, the, queen, with, the, people, and, she, was, happy, to, see, him, restoring, much, of, the, king, s, powers, such, as, his, authority, over, foreign, policy, and, the, right, to, declare, war, over, the, objections, of, lafayette, and, his, allies, the, king, was, given, a, suspensive, veto, allowing, him, to, veto, any, laws, for, a, period, of, four, years, with, time, mirabeau, would, support, the, queen, even, more, going, as, far, as, to, suggest, that, louis, xvi, adjourn, to, rouen, or, compi, gne, this, leverage, with, the, assembly, ended, with, the, death, of, mirabeau, in, april, 1791, despite, the, attempt, of, several, moderate, leaders, of, the, revolution, to, contact, the, queen, to, establish, some, basis, of, cooperation, with, her, in, march, 1791, pope, pius, vi, had, condemned, the, civil, constitution, of, the, clergy, reluctantly, signed, by, louis, xvi, which, reduced, the, number, of, bishops, from, 132, to, 93, imposed, the, election, of, bishops, and, all, members, of, the, clergy, by, departmental, or, district, assemblies, of, electors, and, reduced, the, pope, s, authority, over, the, church, religion, played, an, important, role, in, the, life, of, marie, antoinette, and, louis, xvi, both, raised, in, the, roman, catholic, faith, the, queen, s, political, ideas, and, her, belief, in, the, absolute, power, of, monarchs, were, based, on, france, s, long, established, tradition, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, on, 18, april, as, the, royal, family, prepared, to, leave, for, saint, cloud, to, attend, easter, mass, celebrated, by, a, refractory, priest, a, crowd, soon, joined, by, the, national, guard, disobeying, lafayette, s, orders, prevented, their, departure, from, paris, prompting, marie, antoinette, to, declare, to, lafayette, that, she, and, her, family, were, no, longer, free, this, incident, fortified, her, in, her, determination, to, leave, paris, for, personal, and, political, reasons, not, alone, but, with, her, family, even, the, king, who, had, been, hesitant, accepted, his, wife, s, decision, to, flee, with, the, help, of, foreign, powers, and, counter, revolutionary, forces, fersen, and, breteuil, who, represented, her, in, the, courts, of, europe, were, put, in, charge, of, the, escape, plan, while, marie, antoinette, continued, her, negotiations, with, some, of, the, moderate, leaders, of, the, french, revolution, there, had, been, several, plots, designed, to, help, the, royal, family, escape, which, the, queen, had, rejected, because, she, would, not, leave, without, the, king, or, which, had, ceased, to, be, viable, because, of, the, king, s, indecision, once, louis, xvi, finally, did, commit, to, a, plan, its, poor, execution, was, the, cause, of, its, failure, in, an, elaborate, attempt, known, as, the, flight, to, varennes, to, reach, the, royalist, stronghold, of, montm, dy, some, members, of, the, royal, family, were, to, pose, as, the, servants, of, an, imaginary, mme, de, korff, a, wealthy, russian, baroness, a, role, played, by, louise, lisabeth, de, cro, de, tourzel, governess, of, the, royal, children, after, many, delays, the, escape, was, ultimately, attempted, on, 21, june, 1791, but, the, entire, family, was, arrested, less, than, 24, hours, later, at, varennes, and, taken, back, to, paris, within, a, week, the, escape, attempt, destroyed, much, of, the, remaining, support, of, the, population, for, the, king, upon, learning, of, the, capture, of, the, royal, family, the, national, constituent, assembly, sent, three, representatives, antoine, barnave, j, r, me, p, tion, de, villeneuve, and, charles, c, sar, de, fay, de, la, tour, maubourg, to, varennes, to, escort, marie, antoinette, and, her, family, back, to, paris, on, the, way, to, the, capital, they, were, jeered, and, insulted, by, the, people, as, never, before, the, prestige, of, the, french, monarchy, had, never, been, at, such, a, low, level, during, the, trip, barnave, the, representative, of, the, moderate, party, in, the, assembly, protected, marie, antoinette, from, the, crowds, and, even, p, tion, took, pity, on, the, royal, family, brought, safely, back, to, paris, they, were, met, with, total, silence, by, the, crowd, thanks, to, barnave, the, royal, couple, was, not, brought, to, trial, and, was, publicly, exonerated, of, any, crime, in, relation, with, the, attempted, escape, marie, antoinette, s, first, lady, of, the, bedchamber, jeanne, louise, henriette, campan, wrote, about, what, happened, to, the, queen, s, hair, on, the, night, of, 21, 22, june, in, a, single, night, it, had, turned, white, as, that, of, a, seventy, year, old, woman, en, une, seule, nuit, ils, taient, devenus, blancs, comme, ceux, d, une, femme, de, soixante, dix, ans, after, their, return, from, varennes, and, until, the, storming, of, the, tuileries, on, 10, august, 1792, the, queen, her, family, and, entourage, were, held, under, tight, surveillance, by, the, national, guard, in, the, tuileries, where, the, royal, couple, was, guarded, night, and, day, four, guards, accompanied, the, queen, wherever, she, went, and, her, bedroom, door, had, to, be, left, open, at, night, her, health, also, began, to, deteriorate, thus, further, reducing, her, physical, activities, on, 17, july, 1791, with, the, support, of, barnave, and, his, friends, lafayette, s, garde, nationale, opened, fire, on, the, crowd, that, had, assembled, on, the, champ, de, mars, to, sign, a, petition, demanding, the, deposition, of, the, king, the, estimated, number, of, those, killed, varies, between, 12, and, 50, lafayette, s, reputation, never, recovered, from, the, event, and, on, 8, october, he, resigned, as, commander, of, the, national, guard, their, enmity, continuing, marie, antoinette, played, a, decisive, role, in, defeating, him, in, his, aims, to, become, the, mayor, of, paris, in, november, 1791, as, her, correspondence, shows, while, barnave, was, taking, great, political, risks, in, the, belief, that, the, queen, was, his, political, ally, and, had, managed, despite, her, unpopularity, to, secure, a, moderate, majority, ready, to, work, with, her, marie, antoinette, was, not, considered, sincere, in, her, cooperation, with, the, moderate, leaders, of, the, french, revolution, which, ultimately, ended, any, chance, to, establish, a, moderate, government, moreover, the, view, that, the, unpopular, queen, was, controlling, the, king, further, degraded, the, royal, couple, s, standing, with, the, people, which, the, jacobins, successfully, exploited, after, their, return, from, varennes, to, advance, their, radical, agenda, to, abolish, the, monarchy, this, situation, lasted, until, the, spring, of, 1792, marie, antoinette, continued, to, hope, that, the, military, coalition, of, european, kingdoms, would, succeed, in, crushing, the, revolution, she, counted, most, on, the, support, of, her, austrian, family, after, the, death, of, her, brother, joseph, ii, in, 1790, his, successor, and, younger, brother, leopold, ii, was, willing, to, support, her, to, a, limited, degree, it, was, her, hope, that, the, threat, of, austria, s, advancing, military, would, deter, further, escalation, of, revolutionary, violence, in, a, letter, to, her, brother, penned, in, september, of, 1791, marie, antoinette, expressed, how, she, expected, the, revolution, to, react, it, will, be, effected, by, the, approach, of, the, war, and, not, by, the, war, itself, the, king, his, powers, restored, will, be, entrusted, with, negotiations, with, the, foreign, powers, and, the, princes, will, return, in, the, general, tranquillity, to, reassume, their, ranks, at, his, court, and, in, the, nation, in, the, same, letter, she, wrote, that, the, fall, of, france, s, monarchy, and, the, subsequent, rise, of, revolutionary, principles, would, be, destructive, to, all, governments, upon, leopold, s, death, in, 1792, his, son, francis, a, conservative, ruler, was, ready, to, support, the, cause, of, the, french, royal, couple, more, vigorously, because, he, feared, the, consequences, of, the, french, revolution, and, its, ideas, for, the, monarchies, of, europe, particularly, for, austria, s, influence, in, the, continent, barnave, had, advised, the, queen, to, call, back, mercy, who, had, played, such, an, important, role, in, her, life, before, the, revolution, but, mercy, had, been, appointed, to, another, foreign, diplomatic, position, and, could, not, return, to, france, at, the, end, of, 1791, ignoring, the, danger, she, faced, the, princesse, de, lamballe, who, was, in, london, returned, to, the, tuileries, as, for, fersen, despite, the, strong, restrictions, imposed, on, the, queen, he, was, able, to, see, her, a, final, time, in, february, 1792, leopold, s, and, francis, ii, s, strong, action, on, behalf, of, marie, antoinette, led, to, france, s, declaration, of, war, on, austria, on, 20, april, 1792, this, resulted, in, the, queen, being, viewed, as, an, enemy, although, she, was, personally, against, austrian, claims, to, french, territories, on, european, soil, that, summer, the, situation, was, compounded, by, multiple, defeats, of, the, french, revolutionary, army, by, the, austrians, in, part, because, marie, antoinette, passed, on, military, secrets, to, them, in, addition, at, the, insistence, of, his, wife, louis, xvi, vetoed, several, measures, that, would, have, further, restricted, his, power, earning, the, royal, couple, the, nicknames, monsieur, veto, and, madame, veto, nicknames, then, prominently, featured, in, different, contexts, including, la, carmagnole, barnave, remained, the, most, important, advisor, and, supporter, of, the, queen, who, was, willing, to, work, with, him, as, long, as, he, met, her, demands, which, he, did, to, a, large, extent, barnave, and, the, moderates, comprised, about, 260, lawmakers, in, the, new, legislative, assembly, the, radicals, numbered, around, 136, and, the, rest, around, 350, initially, the, majority, was, with, barnave, but, the, queen, s, policies, led, to, the, radicalization, of, the, assembly, and, the, moderates, lost, control, of, the, legislative, process, the, moderate, government, collapsed, in, april, 1792, to, be, replaced, by, a, radical, majority, headed, by, the, girondins, the, assembly, then, passed, a, series, of, laws, concerning, the, church, the, aristocracy, and, the, formation, of, new, national, guard, units, all, were, vetoed, by, louis, xvi, while, barnave, s, faction, had, dropped, to, 120, members, the, new, girondin, majority, controlled, the, legislative, assembly, with, 330, members, the, two, strongest, members, of, that, government, were, jean, marie, roland, who, was, minister, of, interior, and, general, charles, fran, ois, dumouriez, the, minister, of, foreign, affairs, dumouriez, sympathized, with, the, royal, couple, and, wanted, to, save, them, but, he, was, rebuffed, by, the, queen, marie, antoinette, s, actions, in, refusing, to, collaborate, with, the, girondins, in, power, between, april, and, june, 1792, led, them, to, denounce, the, treason, of, the, austrian, comity, a, direct, allusion, to, the, queen, after, madame, roland, sent, a, letter, to, the, king, denouncing, the, queen, s, role, in, these, matters, urged, by, the, queen, louis, xvi, disbanded, the, government, thus, losing, his, majority, in, the, assembly, dumouriez, resigned, and, refused, a, post, in, any, new, government, at, this, point, the, tide, against, royal, authority, intensified, in, the, population, and, political, parties, while, marie, antoinette, encouraged, the, king, to, veto, the, new, laws, voted, by, the, legislative, assembly, in, 1792, in, august, 1791, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, threatened, an, invasion, of, france, this, led, in, turn, to, a, french, declaration, of, war, in, april, 1792, which, led, to, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, to, the, events, of, august, 1792, which, ended, the, monarchy, on, 20, june, 1792, a, mob, of, terrifying, aspect, broke, into, the, tuileries, made, the, king, wear, the, bonnet, rouge, red, phrygian, cap, to, show, his, loyalty, to, the, revolution, insulted, marie, antoinette, accusing, her, of, betraying, france, and, threatened, her, life, in, consequence, the, queen, asked, fersen, to, urge, the, foreign, powers, to, carry, out, their, plans, to, invade, france, and, to, issue, a, manifesto, in, which, they, threatened, to, destroy, paris, if, anything, happened, to, the, royal, family, the, brunswick, manifesto, issued, on, 25, july, 1792, triggered, the, insurrection, of, 10, august, when, the, approach, of, an, armed, mob, on, its, way, to, the, tuileries, palace, forced, the, royal, family, to, seek, refuge, at, the, legislative, assembly, ninety, minutes, later, the, palace, was, invaded, by, the, mob, who, massacred, the, swiss, guards, on, 13, august, the, royal, family, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, the, temple, in, the, marais, under, conditions, considerably, harsher, than, those, of, their, previous, confinement, in, the, tuileries, a, week, later, several, of, the, royal, family, s, attendants, among, them, the, princesse, de, lamballe, were, taken, for, interrogation, by, the, paris, commune, transferred, to, the, la, force, prison, after, a, rapid, judgment, marie, louise, de, lamballe, was, savagely, killed, on, 3, september, her, head, was, affixed, on, a, pike, and, paraded, through, the, city, to, the, temple, for, the, queen, to, see, marie, antoinette, was, prevented, from, seeing, it, but, fainted, upon, learning, of, it, on, 21, september, 1792, france, was, declared, a, republic, the, monarchy, was, abolished, and, the, national, convention, became, the, governing, body, of, the, french, first, republic, the, royal, family, name, was, downgraded, to, the, non, royal, capets, preparations, began, for, the, trial, of, the, former, king, in, a, court, of, law, charged, with, treason, against, the, french, republic, louis, xvi, was, separated, from, his, family, and, tried, in, december, he, was, found, guilty, by, the, convention, led, by, the, jacobins, who, rejected, the, idea, of, keeping, him, as, a, hostage, on, 15, january, 1793, by, a, majority, of, six, votes, he, was, condemned, to, death, by, guillotine, and, executed, on, 21, january, 1793, the, former, queen, now, called, widow, capet, plunged, into, deep, mourning, she, still, hoped, her, son, louis, charles, whom, the, exiled, count, of, provence, louis, xvi, s, brother, had, recognized, as, louis, xvi, s, successor, would, one, day, rule, france, the, royalists, and, the, refractory, clergy, including, those, preparing, the, insurrection, in, vend, e, supported, marie, antoinette, and, the, return, to, the, monarchy, throughout, her, imprisonment, and, up, to, her, execution, marie, antoinette, could, count, on, the, sympathy, of, conservative, factions, and, social, religious, groups, which, had, turned, against, the, revolution, and, also, on, wealthy, individuals, ready, to, bribe, republican, officials, to, facilitate, her, escape, these, plots, all, failed, while, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, the, temple, marie, antoinette, her, children, and, lisabeth, were, insulted, some, of, the, guards, going, as, far, as, blowing, smoke, in, the, former, queen, s, face, strict, security, measures, were, taken, to, assure, that, marie, antoinette, was, not, able, to, communicate, with, the, outside, world, despite, these, measures, several, of, her, guards, were, open, to, bribery, and, a, line, of, communication, was, kept, with, the, outside, world, after, louis, s, execution, marie, antoinette, s, fate, became, a, central, question, of, the, national, convention, while, some, advocated, her, death, others, proposed, exchanging, her, for, french, prisoners, of, war, or, for, a, ransom, from, the, holy, roman, emperor, thomas, paine, advocated, exile, to, america, in, april, 1793, during, the, reign, of, terror, a, committee, of, public, safety, dominated, by, maximilien, robespierre, was, formed, and, men, such, as, jacques, h, bert, began, to, call, for, marie, antoinette, s, trial, by, the, end, of, may, the, girondins, had, been, chased, from, power, calls, were, also, made, to, retrain, the, eight, year, old, louis, xvii, to, make, him, pliant, to, revolutionary, ideas, to, carry, this, out, louis, charles, was, separated, from, his, mother, on, 3, july, after, a, struggle, during, which, his, mother, fought, in, vain, to, retain, her, son, who, was, handed, over, to, antoine, simon, a, cobbler, and, representative, of, the, paris, commune, until, her, removal, from, the, temple, marie, antoinette, spent, hours, trying, to, catch, a, glimpse, of, her, son, who, within, weeks, had, been, made, to, turn, against, her, accusing, his, mother, of, wrongdoing, on, the, night, of, 1, august, at, 1, 00, in, the, morning, marie, antoinette, was, transferred, from, the, temple, to, an, isolated, cell, in, the, conciergerie, as, prisoner, n, 280, leaving, the, tower, she, bumped, her, head, against, the, lintel, of, a, door, which, prompted, one, of, her, guards, to, ask, her, if, she, was, hurt, to, which, she, answered, no, nothing, now, can, hurt, me, this, was, the, most, difficult, period, of, her, captivity, she, was, under, constant, surveillance, with, no, privacy, the, carnation, plot, le, complot, de, l, illet, an, attempt, to, help, her, escape, at, the, end, of, august, was, foiled, due, to, the, inability, to, corrupt, all, the, guards, she, was, attended, by, rosalie, lamorli, re, who, took, care, of, her, as, much, as, she, could, at, least, once, she, received, a, visit, by, a, catholic, priest, marie, antoinette, was, tried, by, the, revolutionary, tribunal, on, 14, october, 1793, some, historians, believe, the, outcome, of, the, trial, had, been, decided, in, advance, by, the, committee, of, public, safety, around, the, time, the, carnation, plot, was, uncovered, she, and, her, lawyers, were, given, less, than, one, day, to, prepare, her, defense, among, the, accusations, many, previously, published, in, the, libelles, were, orchestrating, orgies, in, versailles, sending, millions, of, livres, of, treasury, money, to, austria, planning, the, massacre, of, the, national, guards, in, 1792, declaring, her, son, to, be, the, new, king, of, france, and, incest, a, charge, made, by, her, son, louis, charles, pressured, into, doing, so, by, the, radical, jacques, h, bert, who, controlled, him, this, last, accusation, drew, an, emotional, response, from, marie, antoinette, who, refused, to, respond, to, this, charge, instead, appealing, to, all, mothers, present, in, the, room, their, reaction, comforted, her, since, these, women, were, not, otherwise, sympathetic, to, her, upon, being, pressed, further, by, a, juror, to, address, the, accusations, of, incest, the, queen, replied, if, i, did, not, respond, it, was, because, it, would, be, against, nature, for, a, mother, to, reply, to, such, an, accusation, on, this, i, appeal, to, all, mothers, who, may, be, here, when, a, juror, joachim, vilate, told, robespierre, of, this, over, dinner, robespierre, broke, his, plate, in, anger, declaring, that, imbecile, h, bert, early, on, 16, october, marie, antoinette, was, declared, guilty, of, the, three, main, charges, against, her, depletion, of, the, national, treasury, conspiracy, against, the, internal, and, external, security, of, the, state, and, high, treason, because, of, her, intelligence, activities, in, the, interest, of, the, enemy, the, latter, charge, alone, was, enough, to, condemn, her, to, death, at, worst, she, and, her, lawyers, had, expected, life, imprisonment, in, the, hours, left, to, her, she, composed, a, letter, to, her, sister, in, law, madame, lisabeth, affirming, her, clear, conscience, her, catholic, faith, and, her, love, and, concern, for, her, children, the, letter, did, not, reach, lisabeth, her, will, was, part, of, the, collection, of, papers, of, robespierre, found, under, his, bed, and, was, published, by, edme, bonaventure, courtois, preparing, for, her, execution, she, had, to, change, clothes, in, front, of, her, guards, she, wanted, to, wear, a, black, dress, but, was, forced, to, wear, a, plain, white, dress, white, being, the, colour, worn, by, widowed, queens, of, france, her, hair, was, shorn, her, hands, bound,

guillotine, at, 12, 15pm, on, 16, october, 1793, during, the, french, revolution, her, last, words, are, recorded, as, pardonnez, moi, monsieur, je, ne, l, ai, pas, fait, expr, s, or, pardon, me, sir, i, did, not, do, it, on, purpose, after, accidentally, stepping, on, her, executioner, s, shoe, marie, tussaud, was, employed, to, make, a, death, mask, of, her, head, her, body, was, thrown, into, an, unmarked, grave, in, the, madeleine, cemetery, located, close, by, in, rue, d, anjou, because, its, capacity, was, exhausted, the, cemetery, was, closed, the, following, year, on, 25, march, 1794, after, her, execution, marie, antoinette, became, a, symbol, abroad, and, a, controversial, figure, of, the, french, revolution, some, used, her, as, a, scapegoat, to, blame, for, the, events, of, the, revolution, thomas, jefferson, writing, in, 1821, claimed, that, her, inordinate, gambling, and, dissipations, with, those, of, the, count, d, artois, and, others, of, her, clique, had, been, a, sensible, item, in, the, exhaustion, of, the, treasury, which, called, into, action, the, reforming, hand, of, the, nation, and, her, opposition, to, it, her, inflexible, perverseness, and, dauntless, spirit, led, herself, to, the, guillotine, adding, that, i, have, ever, believed, that, had, there, been, no, queen, there, would, have, been, no, revolution, in, his, 1790, treatise, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, which, was, written, during, marie, antoinette, s, imprisonment, in, paris, but, prior, to, her, execution, edmund, burke, lamented, that, the, age, of, chivalry, is, gone, that, of, sophisters, economists, and, calculators, has, succeeded, and, the, glory, of, europe, is, extinguished, forever, and, now, never, never, more, shall, we, behold, that, generous, loyalty, to, rank, and, sex, after, receiving, the, news, maria, carolina, queen, of, naples, and, close, sister, to, marie, antoinette, spiraled, into, a, state, of, mourning, and, an, anger, against, the, revolutionaries, she, quickly, suspended, protections, of, reformers, and, intellectuals, in, naples, allowed, neapolitan, bishops, wide, latitude, to, halt, the, secularization, of, the, country, and, offered, succor, to, the, overflowing, number, of, migr, s, fleeing, from, revolutionary, france, many, of, whom, were, granted, pensions, both, marie, antoinette, s, and, louis, xvi, s, bodies, were, exhumed, on, 18, january, 1815, during, the, bourbon, restoration, when, the, count, of, provence, ascended, the, newly, reestablished, throne, as, louis, xviii, king, of,

for, many, revolutionary, figures, marie, antoinette, was, the, symbol, of, what, was, wrong, with, the, old, regime, in, france, the, onus, of, having, caused, the, financial, difficulties, of, the, nation, was, placed, on, her, shoulders, by, the, revolutionary, tribunal, and, under, the, new, republican, ideas, of, what, it, meant, to, be, a, member, of, a, nation, her, austrian, descent, and, continued, correspondence, with, the, competing, nation, made, her, a, traitor, the, people, of, france, saw, her, death, as, a, necessary, step, toward, completing, the, revolution, furthermore, her, execution, was, seen, as, a, sign, that, the, revolution, had, done, its, work, marie, antoinette, is, also, known, for, her, taste, for, fine, things, and, her, commissions, from, famous, craftsmen, such, as, jean, henri, riesener, suggest, more, about, her, enduring, legacy, as, a, woman, of, taste, and, patronage, for, instance, a, writing, table, attributed, to, riesener, now, located, at, waddesdon, manor, bears, witness, to, marie, antoinette, s, desire, to, escape, the, oppressive, formality, of, court, life, when, she, decided, to, move, the, table, from, the, queen, s, boudoir, de, la, meridienne, at, versailles, to, her, humble, interior, the, petit, trianon, her, favourite, objects, filled, her, small, private, chateau, and, reveal, aspects, of, marie, antoinette, s, character, that, have, been, obscured, by, satirical, political, prints, such, as, those, in, les, tableaux, de, la, r, volution, she, owned, several, instruments, in, 1788, she, bought, a, piano, made, by, s, bastien, rard, a, catalog, of, marie, antoinette, s, personal, library, of, 736, volumes, was, published, by, paul, lacroix, in, 1863, using, his, pseudonym, p, l, jacob, the, listed, books, were, from, her, library, at, the, petit, trianon, including, many, found, in, her, boudoir, and, mostly, consist, of, novels, and, plays, a, random, selection, of, her, books, includes,

a, larger, and, more, official, library, belonging, to, marie, antoinette, was, kept, at, the, tuileries, palace, in, paris, long, after, her, death, marie, antoinette, remains, a, major, historical, figure, linked, with, conservatism, the, catholic, church, wealth, and, fashion, she, has, been, the, subject, of, a, number, of, books, films, and, other, media, politically, engaged, authors, have, deemed, her, the, quintessential, representative, of, class, conflict, western, aristocracy, and, absolutism, some, of, her, contemporaries, such, as, thomas, jefferson, attributed, to, her, the, start, of, the, french, revolution, the, phrase, let, them, eat, cake, is, often, conventionally, attributed, to, marie, antoinette, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, she, ever, uttered, it, and, it, is, now, generally, regarded, as, a, journalistic, clich, this, phrase, originally, appeared, in, book, vi, of, the, first, part, of, jean, jacques, rousseau, s, autobiographical, work, les,
