they, are, free, from, any, sin, and, pollution, muhammad, reported, the, karbala, incident, on, several, occasions, for, example, he, gave, a, small, bottle, of, soil, to, umm, salama, and, told, her, that, the, soil, inside, the, bottle, would, turn, into, blood, after, husayn, was, killed, in, the, year, 10, ah, 631, 632, a, christian, envoy, from, najran, now, in, northern, yemen, came, to, muhammad, to, argue, which, of, the, two, parties, erred, in, its, doctrine, concerning, jesus, after, likening, jesus, miraculous, birth, to, adam, s, creation, who, was, born, to, neither, a, mother, nor, a, father, and, when, the, christians, did, not, accept, the, islamic, doctrine, about, jesus, muhammad, reportedly, received, a, revelation, instructing, him, to, call, them, to, mubahala, where, each, party, should, ask, god, to, destroy, the, false, party, and, their, families, if, anyone, dispute, with, you, in, this, matter, after, the, knowledge, which, has, come, to, you, say, come, let, us, call, our, sons, and, your, sons, our, women, and, your, women, ourselves, and, yourselves, then, let, us, swear, an, oath, and, place, the, curse, of, god, on, those, who, lie, qur, an, 3, 61, in, shia, perspective, in, the, verse, of, mubahala, the, phrase, our, sons, would, refer, to, hasan, and, husayn, our, women, refers, to, fatima, and, ourselves, refers, to, ali,

utterly, pure, is, also, attributed, to, this, event, during, which, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, stood, under, muhammad, s, cloak, thus, the, title, the, family, of, the, cloak, is, related, sometimes, to, the, event, of, mubahala, during, the, caliphate, of, abu, bakr, and, umar, husayn, was, present, at, some, events, such, as, testifying, about, the, story, of, fadak, according, to, a,

hasan, accepted, it, later, on, when, several, shia, leaders, suggested, him, to, conduct, a, surprise, attack, on, mu, awiya, s, camp, near, kufa, he, refused, saying, that, as, long, as, mu, awiya, was, alive, he, would, abide, by, the, terms, of, the, peace, treaty, however, after, mu, awiya, s, death, he, will, reconsider, it, after, signing, the, peace, treaty, mu, awiyah, delivered, a, sermon, in, kufa, in, which, he, declared, that, he, had, violated, all, the, provisions, of, the, treaty, and, also, insulted, ali, ibn, abi, talib, husayn, wanted, to, respond, but, hasan, refused, to, do, so, and, hasan, delivered, a, sermon, in, response, husayn, adhered, to, the, terms, of, the, treaty, even, after, hassan, s, death, husayn, then, left, kufa, for, medina, along, with, hasan, and, abdullah, ibn, ja, far, he, adhered, to, the, terms, of, the, treaty, even, after, hasan, s, death, according, to, the, shi, a, husayn, was, the, third, imam, for, a, period, of, ten, years, after, the, death, of, his, brother, hasan, in, 670, ad, all, of, this, time, except, the, last, six, months, coincided, with, the, caliphate, of, mu, awiya, in, the, nine, year, period, between, hasan, s, abdication, in, ah, 41, 660, ad, and, his, death, in, ah, 49, 669, ad, hasan, and, husayn, retreated, to, medina, trying, to, keep, aloof, from, political, involvement, for, or, against, mu, awiya, sentiments, in, favor, of, the, rule, of, ahl, al, bayt, occasionally, emerged, in, the, form, of, small, groups, mostly, from, kufa, visiting, hasan, and, husayn, asking, them, to, be, their, leaders, a, request, to, which, they, declined, to, respond, when, hasan, was, poisoned, he, refused, to, tell, husayn, the, name, of, his, suspect, probably, mu, awiya, in, fear, of, provoking, bloodshed, the, burial, of, hasan, s, body, near, that, of, muhammad, was, another, problem, which, could, have, led, to, bloodshed, as, marwan, ibn, hakam, swore, that, he, would, not, permit, hasan, to, be, buried, near, muhammad, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, while, uthman, was, buried, in, the, cemetery, of, al, baqi, after, the, death, of, hasan, when, iraqis, turned, to, husayn, concerning, an,

shias, to, husayn, mu, awiya, instructed, marwan, not, to, clash, with, husayn, in, the, same, time, he, wrote, a, letter, to, husayn, in, which, he, mingled, generous, promises, with, the, advice, not, to, provoke, him, later, on, when, mu, awiya, was, taking, allegiance, for, his, son, yazid, husayn, was, among, the, five, prominent, persons, who, did, not, give, his, allegiance, as, appointing, a, successor, was, in, violation, of, hasan, s, peace, treaty, with, mu, awiya, before, his, death, in, april, 680, mu, awiya, cautioned, yazid, that, husayn, and, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, might, challenge, his, rule, and, instructed, him, to, defeat, them, if, they, did, yazid, was, further, advised, to, treat, husayn, with, caution, and, not, to, spill, his, blood, since, he, was, the, grandson, of, muhammad, immediately, after, mu, awiya, s, death, on, 15th, of, rajab, 60, ah, 22, april, 680, ad, yazid, charged, the, governor, of, medina, walid, ibn, utba, ibn, abu, sufyan, to, secure, allegiance, from, husayn, with, force, if, necessary, yazid, s, goal, was, to, take, control, of, the, situation, in, the, city, before, the, people, became, aware, of, mu, awiya, s, death, yazid, s, concern, was, especially, about, his, two, rivals, in, the, caliphate, husayn, and, abdullah, ibn, zubayr, who, had, previously, renounced, allegiance, husayn, answered, the, summons, but, declined, to, pledge, allegiance, in, the, secretive, environment, of, the, meeting, suggesting, it, should, be, done, in, public, marwan, ibn, hakam, told, walid, to, imprison, or, behead, him, but, due, to, husayn, s, kinship, with, muhammad, walid, was, unwilling, to, take, any, action, against, him, a, few, days, later, husayn, left, for, mecca, without, acknowledging, yazid, he, arrived, in, mecca, at, the, beginning, of, may, 680, and, stayed, there, until, the, beginning, of, september, he, was, accompanied, by, his, wives, children, and, brothers, as, well, as, hasan, s, sons, husayn, had, considerable, support, in, kufa, which, had, been, the, caliphal, capital, during, the, reigns, of, his, father, and, brother, the, kufans, had, fought, the, umayyads, and, their, syrian, allies, during, the, first, fitna, the, five, year, civil, war, which, had, established, the, umayyad, caliphate, they, were, dissatisfied, with, hasan, s, abdication, and, strongly, resented, umayyad, rule, while, in, mecca, husayn, received, letters, from, pro, alids, in, kufa, informing, him, that, they, were, tired, of, the, umayyad, rule, which, they, considered, to, be, oppressive, and, that, they, had, no, rightful, leader, they, asked, him, to, lead, them, in, revolt, against, yazid, promising, to, remove, the, umayyad, governor, if, husayn, would, consent, to, aid, them, husayn, wrote, back, affirmatively, that, a, rightful, leader, is, the, one, who, acts, according, to, the, qur, an, and, promised, to, lead, them, with, the, right, guidance, then, he, sent, his, cousin, muslim, ibn, aqil, to, assess, the, situation, in, kufa, ibn, aqil, attracted, widespread, support, and, informed, husayn, of, the, situation, suggesting, that, he, join, them, there, yazid, removed, nu, man, ibn, bashir, al, ansari, as, governor, of, kufa, due, to, his, inaction, and, installed, ubayd, allah, ibn, ziyad, then, governor, of, basra, in, his, place, as, a, result, of, ibn, ziyad, s, suppression, and, political, maneuvering, ibn, aqil, s, following, began, to, dissipate, and, he, was, forced, to, declare, the, revolt, prematurely, it, was, defeated, and, ibn, aqil, was, killed, husayn, had, also, sent, a, messenger, to, basra, another, garrison, town, in, iraq, but, the, messenger, could, not, attract, any, following, and, was, quickly, apprehended, and, executed, husayn, was, unaware, of, the, change, of, political, circumstances, in, kufa, and, decided, to, depart, abd, allah, ibn, abbas, and, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, advised, him, not, to, move, to, iraq, or, if, he, was, determined, not, to, take, women, and, children, with, him, nevertheless, he, offered, husayn, support, if, he, would, stay, in, mecca, and, lead, the, opposition, to, yazid, from, there, husayn, refused, this, citing, his, abhorrence, of, bloodshed, in, the, sanctuary, and, decided, to, go, ahead, with, his, plan, despite, the, advice, of, muhammad, ibn, hanafiyya, abdullah, ibn, umar, and, the, constant, insistence, of, abd, allah, ibn, abbas, in, mecca, husayn, did, not, back, down, from, his, decision, to, go, to, kufa, ibn, abbas, pointed, out, that, the, kufis, had, left, both, his, father, ali, and, his, brother, hasan, alone, and, suggested, that, husayn, go, to, yemen, instead, of, kufa, or, at, least, not, take, women, and, children, with, him, if, he, were, to, go, to, iraq, husayn, insisted, on, his, decision, and, wrote, about, his, motives, and, goals, in, a, famous, letter, or, will, that, he, gave, to, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyyah, i, did, not, go, out, for, fun, and, selfishness, and, for, corruption, and, oppression, rather, my, goal, is, to, correct, the, corruptions, that, have, occurred, in, the, nation, of, my, ancestors, i, want, to, command, the, good, and, forbid, the, bad, and, follow, the, tradition, of, my, grandfather, and, the, way, of, my, father, ali, ibn, abi, talib, so, whoever, accepts, this, truth, and, follows, me, has, accepted, the, way, of, god, and, whoever, rejects, and, does, not, follow, me, i, will, walk, my, way, with, patience, and, perseverance, so, that, god, may, be, the, judge, between, me, and, this, nation, and, he, is, the, best, judge, then, husayn, who, had, not, yet, received, the, letters, of, the, new, events, of, kufa, prepared, to, leave, for, kufa, on, the, 8th, or, 10th, of, dhu, al, hijjah, 60, ah, 10, or, 12, september, 680, ad, instead, of, performing, hajj, he, performed, umrah, and, in, the, absence, of, the, governor, of, mecca, amr, ibn, sa, id, ibn,

return, relating, that, muhammad, had, ordered, him, in, a, dream, to, move, forward, irrespective, of, the, consequences, further, on, the, way, he, received, the, news, of, the, execution, of, ibn, aqil, and, the, indifference, of, the, people, of, kufa, he, informed, his, followers, of, the, situation, and, asked, them, to, leave, most, of, the, people, who, had, joined, him, on, the, way, left, while, his, companions, from, mecca, decided, to, stay, with, him, on, the, way, husayn, encountered, various, people, in, response, to, husayn, s, question, about, the, situation, in, iraq, the, poet, farzadaq, explicitly, told, him, that, the, hearts, of, the, iraqi, people, are, with, you, but, their, swords, are, in, the, service, of, the, umayyads, but, husayn, s, decision, was, unwavering, and, in, response, to, those, who, tried, to, dissuade, him, he, said, that, things, were, in, god, s, hands, and, that, god, wanted, the, best, for, his, servants, and, would, not, be, hostile, to, anyone, who, was, right, the, news, of, the, murder, of, muslim, ibn, aqeel, and, hani, ibn, arwa, was, reported, by, some, travellers, for, the, first, time, in, thalabiyah, when, husayn, reached, the, area, of, zabalah, he, found, out, that, his, messenger, qais, ibn, mushar, sa, idawi, or, his, brother, in, law, abdullah, ibn, yaqtar, who, had, been, sent, from, hejaz, to, kufa, to, inform, the, people, of, husayn, s, imminent, arrival, was, exposed, and, killed, by, falling, from, the, roof, of, kufa, palace, upon, hearing, this, husayn, allowed, his, supporters, to, leave, the, caravan, due, to, the, depressing, issues, such, as, the, betrayal, of, the, kufis, a, number, of, those, who, had, joined, him, on, the, way, parted, away, but, those, who, had, come, with, husayn, from, hejaz, did, not, leave, him, the, news, from, kufa, showed, that, the, situation, there, had, completely, changed, from, what, muslim, had, reported, the, political, assessments,

of, uniting, the, ummah, our, family, is, more, deserving, of, government, than, anyone, else, and, those, in, power, do, not, deserve, it, and, rule, unjustly, if, you, support, me, i, will, go, to,

letters, were, brought, to, me, and, your, messengers, came, to, me, saying, come, to, us, for, we, have, no, imam, therefore, if, you, give, me, what, you, guaranteed, in, your, covenants, and, sworn, testimonies, i, will, come, to, your, town, if, you, will, not, and, are, averse, to, my, coming, i, will, leave, you, for, the, place, from, which, i, came, to, you, he, then, showed, them, the, letters, he, had, received, from, the, kufans, including, some, in, hurr, s, force, hurr, denied, any, knowledge, of, the, letters, and, stated, that, husayn, must, go, with, him, to, ibn, ziyad, which, husayn, refused, to, do, hurr, responded, that, he, would, not, allow, husayn, to, either, enter, kufa, or, go, back, to, medina, but, that, he, was, free, to, travel, anywhere, else, he, wished, nevertheless, he, did, not, prevent, four, kufans, from, joining, husayn, husayn, s, caravan, started, to, move, towards, qadisiyya, and, hurr, followed, them, at, naynawa, hurr, received, orders, from, ibn, ziyad, to, force, husayn, s, caravan, to, halt, in, a, desolate, place, without, fortifications, or, water, one, of, husayn, s, companions, suggested, that, they, attack, hurr, and, move, to, the, fortified, village, of, al, aqr, husayn, refused, stating, that, he, did, not, want, to, start, the, hostilities, according, to, valiri, hurr, ordered, his, army, to, take, husayn, and, his, companions, to, ibn, ziyad, without, fighting, and, intended, to, persuade, husayn, to, do, so, but, when, he, saw, that, husayn, was, moving, his, caravan, he, did, not, dare, to, follow, it, however, madlung, and, bahramian, write, that, when, husayn, was, ready, to, leave, hurr, blocked, his, way, and, said, that, if, husayn, did, not, accept, the, order, given, by, ibn, ziyad, hurr, would, not, allow, him, to, go, to, medina, or, kufa, he, suggested, to, husayn, to, neither, go, to, kufa, nor, to, medina, rather, write, a, letter, to, yazid, or, ibn, ziyad, and, wait, for, their, orders, hoping, to, avoid, this, difficult, situation, by, receiving, an, answer, but, husayn, did, not, heed, to, his, advice, and, continued, to, azad, or, qadisiyah, hurr, informed, husayn, that, he, was, doing, this, for, husayn, and, that, if, there, would, be, a, war, husayn, would, be, killed, husayn, however, was, not, afraid, of, death, and, stopped, in, an, area, called, karbala, on, the, outskirts, of, kufa, in, one, place, husayn, recited, a, sermon, and, said, i, do, not, see, death, except, as, martyrdom, and, living, with, the, oppressors, except, as, hardship, in, another, place, he, explained, the, reason, for, his, opposition, to, the, government, while, recalling, the, bitterness, of, breaking, the, allegiance, of, the, people, of, kufa, with, his, father, and, brother, saying, these, people, have, submitted, to, the, obedience, of, satan, and, have, left, the, obedience, of, god, the, merciful, on, the, way, he, refused, to, accept, the, offer, to, go, to, the, tribe, of, tayy, by, pointing, to, his, pact, with, hurr, about, not, returning, later, a, messenger, from, ibn, ziad, came, to, hur, and, without, greeting, husayn, gave, a, letter, to, hur, in, which, ibn, ziad, had, ordered, him, to, not, to, stop, in, a, place, where, husayn, can, have, easy, access, to, water, with, this, letter, obaidullah, wanted, to, force, husayn, to, fight, zuhair, ibn, qayn, suggested, to, husayn, to, attack, the, small, army, of, hur, and, capture, the, fortified, village, of, akr, but, husayn, did, not, accept, because, he, did, not, want, to, start, a, war, on, 2, october, 680, 2, muharram, 61, ah, husayn, arrived, at, karbala, a, desert, plain, 70, kilometers, 43, mi, north, of, kufa, and, set, up, camp, on, the, following, day, a, 4, 000, strong, kufan, army, arrived, under, the, command, of, umar, ibn, sa, d, he, had, been, appointed, governor, of, rayy, to, suppress, a, local, rebellion, but, then, recalled, to, confront, husayn, initially, he, was, unwilling, to, fight, husayn, but, complied, following, ibn, ziyad, s, threat, to, revoke, his, governorship, after, negotiations, with, husayn, ibn, sa, d, wrote, to, ibn, ziyad, that, husayn, was, willing, to, return, ibn, ziyad, replied, that, husayn, must, surrender, or, he, should, be, subdued, by, force, and, that, to, compel, him, he, and, his, companions, should, be, denied, access, to, the, euphrates, river, ibn, sa, d, stationed, 500, horsemen, on, the, route, leading, to, the, river, husayn, and, his, companions, remained, without, water, for, three, days, before, a, group, of, fifty, men, led, by, his, half, brother, abbas, was, able, to, access, the, river, they, could, only, fill, twenty, water, skins, husayn, and, ibn, sa, d, met, during, the, night, to, negotiate, a, settlement, it, was, rumored, that, husayn, made, three, proposals, either, he, be, allowed, to, return, to, medina, submit, to, yazid, directly, or, be, sent, to, a, border, post, where, he, would, fight, alongside, the, muslim, armies, according, to, madelung, these, reports, are, probably, untrue, as, husayn, at, this, stage, is, unlikely, to, have, considered, submitting, to, yazid, a, mawla, of, husayn, s, wife, later, claimed, that, husayn, had, suggested, that, he, be, allowed, to, leave, so, that, all, parties, could, allow, the, fluid, political, situation, to, clarify, ibn, sa, d, sent, the, proposal, whatever, it, was, to, ibn, ziyad, who, is, reported, to, have, accepted, but, then, persuaded, otherwise, by, shemr, ibn, ziljawshan, shemr, argued, that, husayn, was, in, his, domain, and, letting, him, go, would, be, to, demonstrate, weakness, ibn, ziyad, then, sent, shemr, with, orders, to, ask, husayn, for, his, allegiance, once, more, and, to, attack, kill, and, disfigure, him, if, he, was, to, refuse, as, a, rebel, a, seditious, person, a, brigand, an, oppressor, and, he, was, to, do, no, further, harm, after, his, death, if, ibn, sa, d, was, unwilling, to, carry, out, the, attack, he, was, instructed, to, hand, over, command, to, shemr, ibn, sa, d, cursed, shemr, and, accused, him, of, foiling, his, attempts, to, reach, a, peaceful, settlement, but, agreed, to, carry, out, the, orders, he, remarked, that, husayn, would, not, submit, because, there, was, a, proud, soul, in, him, the, army, advanced, toward, husayn, s, camp, on, the, evening, of, 9, october, husayn, sent, abbas, to, ask, ibn, sa, d, to, wait, until, the, next, morning, so, that, they, could, consider, the, matter, ibn, sa, d, agreed, to, this, respite, husayn, told, his, men, that, they, were, all, free, to, leave, with, his, family, under, the, cover, of, night, since, their, opponents, only, wanted, him, very, few, availed, themselves, of, this, opportunity, defense, arrangements, were, made, tents, were, brought, together, and, tied, to, one, another, and, a, ditch, was, dug, behind, the, tents, and, filled, with, wood, ready, to, be, set, alight, in, case, of, attack, husayn, and, his, followers, then, spent, the, rest, of, the, night, praying, after, the, morning, prayer, on, 10, october, both, parties, took, up, battle, positions, husayn, appointed, zuhayr, ibn, qayn, to, command, the, right, flank, of, his, army, habib, ibn, muzahir, to, command, the, left, flank, and, his, half, brother, abbas, as, the, standard, bearer, husayn, s, companions, according, to, most, accounts, numbered, thirty, two, horsemen, and, forty, infantrymen, ibn, sa, d, s, army, totaled, 4, 000, the, ditch, containing, wood, were, set, alight, husayn, then, delivered, a, speech, to, his, opponents, reminding, them, of, his, status, as, muhammad, s, grandson, and, reproaching, them, for, inviting, and, then, abandoning, him, he, asked, to, be, allowed, to, leave, he, was, told, that, first, he, had, to, submit, to, yazid, s, authority, which, he, refused, to, do, husayn, s, speech, moved, hurr, to, defect, to, his, side, after, husayn, s, speech, zuhayr, ibn, qayn, attempted, to, dissuade, ibn, sa, d, s, soldiers, from, killing, husayn, but, in, vain, ibn, sa, d, s, army, fired, several, volleys, of, arrows, this, was, followed, by, duels, in, which, several, of, husayn, s, companions, were, slain, the, right, wing, of, the, kufans, led, by, amr, ibn, al, hajjaj, attacked, husayn, s, force, but, was, repulsed, hand, to, hand, fighting, paused, and, further, volleys, of, arrows, were, exchanged, shemr, who, commanded, the, left, wing, of, the, umayyad, army, launched, an, attack, but, after, losses, on, both, sides, he, was, repulsed, this, was, followed, by, cavalry, attacks, husayn, s, cavalry, resisted, fiercely, and, ibn, sa, d, brought, in, armoured, cavalry, and, five, hundred, archers, after, their, horses, were, wounded, by, arrows, husayn, s, cavalrymen, dismounted, and, fought, on, foot, since, umayyad, forces, could, approach, husayn, s, army, from, the, front, only, ibn, sa, d, ordered, the, tents, to, be, burned, all, except, the, one, which, husayn, and, his, family, were, using, were, set, on, fire, shemr, wanted, to, burn, that, one, too, but, was, prevented, by, his, companions, the, plan, backfired, and, flames, hindered, the, umayyad, advance, for, a, while, after, noon, prayers, husayn, s, companions, were, encircled, and, almost, all, of, them, were, killed, husayn, s, relatives, who, had, not, taken, part, in, the, fighting, so, far, joined, the, battle, husayn, s, son, ali, akbar, was, killed, then, husayn, s, half, brothers, including, abbas, and, the, sons, of, aqil, ibn, abi, talib, jafar, ibn, abi, talib, and, hasan, ibn, ali, were, slain, the, account, of, abbas, death, is, not, given, in, the, primary, sources, al, tabari, and, baladhuri, but, a, prominent, shi, a, theologian, shaykh, al, mufid, states, in, his, account, in, kitab, al, irshad, that, abbas, went, to, the, river, together, with, husayn, but, became, separated, was, surrounded, and, killed, at, some, point, a, young, child, of, husayn, s, who, was, sitting, on, his, lap, was, hit, by, an, arrow, and, died, during, the, battle, of, karbala, the, umayyad, soldiers, hesitated, to, initiate, a, direct, attack, on, husayn, however, he, was, struck, in, the, mouth, by, an, arrow, as, he, went, to, the, river, to, drink, he, collected, his, blood, in, a, cupped, hand, and, cast, towards, the, sky, complaining, to, god, of, his, suffering, later, he, was, surrounded, and, struck, on, the, head, by, malik, ibn, nusayr, the, blow, cut, through, his, hooded, cloak, which, husayn, removed, while, cursing, his, attacker, he, put, a, cap, on, his, head, and, wrapped, a, turban, around, it, to, staunch, the, bleeding, ibn, nusayr, seized, the, bloodied, cloak, and, retreated, shemr, advanced, with, a, group, of, foot, soldiers, towards, husayn, who, was, now, prepared, to, fight, as, few, people, were, left, on, his, side, a, young, boy, from, husayn, s, camp, escaped, from, the, tents, ran, to, him, tried, to, defend, him, from, a, sword, stroke, and, had, his, arm, cut, off, ibn, sa, d, approached, the, tents, and, husayn, s, sister, zaynab, complained, to, him, umar, b, sa, d, will, abu, abd, allah, the, kunya, of, husayn, be, killed, while, you, stand, and, watch, ibn, sa, d, wept, but, did, nothing, husayn, is, said, to, have, killed, many, of, his, attackers, the, umayyad, forces, however, were, still, unwilling, to, kill, him, and, each, of, them, wanted, to, leave, this, to, somebody, else, eventually, shemr, shouted, shame, on, you, why, are, you, waiting, for, the, man, kill, him, may, your, mothers, be, deprived, of, you, the, umayyad, soldiers, then, rushed, husayn, and, wounded, him, on, his, hand, and, shoulder, he, fell, on, the, ground, face, down, and, an, attacker, named, sinan, ibn, anas, stabbed, and, beheaded, him, seventy, or, seventy, two, people, died, on, husayn, s, side, of, whom, about, twenty, were, descendants, of, abu, talib, the, father, of, ali, this, included, two, of, husayn, s, sons, six, of, his, paternal, brothers, three, sons, of, hasan, ibn, ali, three, sons, of, jafar, ibn, abi, talib, and, three, sons, and, three, grandsons, of, aqil, ibn, abi, talib, following, the, battle, husayn, s, clothes, were, stripped, and, his, sword, shoes, and, baggage, were, taken, the, women, s, jewelry, and, cloaks, were, also, seized, shemr, wanted, to, kill, husayn, s, only, surviving, son, ali, al, sajjad, who, had, not, taken, part, in, the, fighting, because, of, illness, but, was, prevented, by, ibn, sa, d, there, are, reports, of, more, than, sixty, wounds, on, husayn, s, body, which, was, then, trampled, with, horses, as, previously, instructed, by, ibn, ziyad, the, bodies, of, husayn, s, companions, were, decapitated, there, were, eighty, eight, dead, in, ibn, sa, d, s, army, who, were, buried, before, he, left, after, his, departure, members, of, the, banu, asad, tribe, from, the, nearby, village, of, ghadiriya, buried, the, headless, bodies, of, husayn, s, companions, husayn, s, family, along, with, the, heads, of, the, dead, were, sent, to, ibn, ziyad, he, poked, husayn, s, mouth, with, a, stick, and, intended, to, kill, ali, al, sajjad, but, spared, him, after, the, pleas, of, husayn, s, sister, zaynab, the, heads, and, the, family, were, then, sent, to, yazid, who, also, poked, husayn, s, mouth, with, a, stick, the, historian, henri, lammens, has, suggested, that, this, is, a, duplication, of, the, report, regarding, ibn, ziyad, no, one, was, compassionate, towards, the, women, and, ali, al, sajjad, one, of, his, courtiers, asked, for, the, hand, of, a, captive, woman, from, husayn, s, family, in, marriage, which, resulted, in, heated, altercation, between, yazid, and, zaynab, the, women, of, yazid, s, household, joined, the, captive, women, in, their, lamentation, for, the, dead, after, a, few, years, the, women, were, compensated, for, their, belongings, looted, in, karbala, and, were, sent, back, to, medina, the, killing, of, the, grandson, of, muhammad, shocked, the, muslim, community, the, image, of, yazid, suffered, and, gave, rise, to, sentiment, that, he, was, impious, prior, to, the, battle, of, karbala, the, muslim, community, was, divided, into, two, political, factions, nonetheless, a, religious, sect, with, distinct, theological, doctrines, and, specific, set, of, rituals, had, not, developed, karbala, gave, this, early, political, party, of, pro, alids, a, distinct, religious, identity, and, helped, transform, it, into, a, distinct, religious, sect, heinz, halm, writes, there, was, no, religious, aspect, to, shi, ism, prior, to, 680, the, death, of, the, third, imam, and, his, followers, marked, the, big, bang, that, created, the, rapidly, expanding, cosmos, of, shi, ism, and, brought, it, into, motion, a, few, prominent, alid, supporters, in, kufa, felt, guilty, for, abandoning, husayn, after, having, invited, him, to, revolt, to, atone, for, what, they, perceived, as, their, sin, they, began, a, movement, known, as, tawwabin, uprising, under, sulayman, ibn, surad, a, companion, of, muhammad, to, fight, the, umayyads, and, attracted, large, scale, support, the, armies, met, in, january, 685, at, battle, of, ayn, al, warda, which, resulted, killing, most, of, them, including, ibn, surad, the, defeat, of, the, tawwabin, left, the, leadership, of, the, kufan, pro, alids, in, the, hand, of, mukhtar, al, thaqafi, in, october, 685, mukhtar, and, his, supporters, seized, kufa, his, control, extended, to, most, of, iraq, and, parts, of, northwestern, iran, mukhtar, executed, kufans, involved, in, the, killing, of, husayn, including, ibn, sa, d, and, shemr, while, thousands, of, people, fled, to, basra, he, then, sent, his, general, ibrahim, ibn, al, ashtar, to, fight, an, approaching, umayyad, army, led, by, ibn, ziyad, which, had, been, sent, to, reconquer, the, province, the, umayyad, army, was, routed, at, the, battle, of, khazir, in, august, 686, and, ibn, ziyad, was, slain, later, on, in, april, 687, mukhtar, was, killed, based, on, an, official, report, sent, to, caliph, yazid, which, describes, the, battle, of, karbala, very, briefly, stating, that, it, lasted, for, no, longer, than, a, siesta, lammens, concludes, that, there, was, no, battle, at, all, but, a, quick, massacre, that, was, over, in, an, hour, he, suggests, that, the, detailed, accounts, found, in, the, primary, sources, are, iraqi, fabrications, since, their, writers, were, dissatisfied, with, their, hero, being, killed, without, putting, up, a, fight, this, is, countered, by, the, historian, laura, veccia, vaglieri, who, argues, that, despite, there, being, some, fabricated, accounts, all, of, the, contemporary, accounts, together, form, a, coherent, and, credible, narrative, she, criticizes, lammens, hypothesis, as, being, based, on, a, single, isolated, report, and, being, devoid, of, critical, analysis, similarly, madelung, and, wellhausen, assert, that, the, battle, lasted, from, sunrise, to, sunset, and, that, the, overall, account, of, the, battle, is, reliable, vaglieri, and, madelung, explain, the, length, of, the, battle, despite, the, numerical, disparity, between, the, opposing, camps, as, ibn, sa, d, s, attempt, to, prolong, the, fight, and, pressure, husayn, into, submission, instead, of, attempting, to, quickly, overwhelm, and, kill, him, according, to, wellhausen, the, compassion, that, yazid, showed, to, the, family, of, husayn, and, his, cursing, of, ibn, ziyad, was, only, for, show, he, argues, that, if, killing, husayn, was, a, crime, its, responsibility, lay, with, yazid, and, not, ibn, ziyad, who, was, only, performing, his, duty, madelung, holds, a, similar, view, according, to, him, early, accounts, place, the, responsibility, for, husayn, s, death, on, ibn, ziyad, instead, of, yazid, yazid, madelung, argues, wanted, to, end, husayn, s, opposition, but, as, a, caliph, of, islam, could, not, afford, to, be, seen, as, publicly, responsible, and, so, diverted, blame, onto, ibn, ziyad, by, hypocritically, cursing, him, according, to, howard, some, traditional, sources, have, a, tendency, to, exonerate, yazid, at, the, cost, of, ibn, ziyad, and, lower, authorities, the, primary, source, of, the, karbala, narrative, is, the, work, of, the, kufan, historian, abu, mikhnaf, titled, kitab, maqtal, al, husayn, abu, mikhnaf, s, was, an, adult, some, twenty, years, after, the, battle, of, karbala, as, such, he, knew, many, eyewitnesses, and, collected, firsthand, accounts, and, some, with, very, short, chains, of, transmitters, usually, one, or, two, intermediaries, the, eyewitnesses, were, of, two, kinds, those, from, husayn, s, side, and, those, from, ibn, sa, d, s, army, since, few, people, from, husayn, s, camp, survived, most, eyewitnesses, were, from, the, second, category, according, to, julius, wellhausen, most, of, them, regretted, their, actions, in, the, battle, and, embellished, the, accounts, of, the, battle, in, favor, of, husayn, in, order, to, dilute, their, guilt, although, as, an, iraqi, abu, mikhnaf, had, pro, alid, tendencies, his, reports, generally, do, not, contain, much, bias, on, his, part, abu, mikhnaf, s, original, text, seems, to, have, been, lost, and, the, version, extant, today, has, been, transmitted, through, secondary, sources, such, as, the, history, of, prophets, and, kings, by, al, tabari, and, ansab, al, ashraf, by, baladhuri, tabari, quotes, either, directly, from, abu, mikhnaf, or, from, his, student, ibn, al, kalbi, who, took, most, of, his, material, from, abu, mikhnaf, tabari, occasionally, takes, material, from, ammar, ibn, mu, awiya, awana, and, other, primary, sources, which, however, adds, little, to, the, narrative, baladhuri, uses, same, sources, as, tabari, information, on, the, battle, found, in, the, works, of, dinawari, and, ya, qubi, is, also, based, on, abu, mikhnaf, s, maqtal, although, they, occasionally, provide, some, extra, notes, and, verses, other, secondary, sources, include, al, mas, udi, s, muruj, al, dhahab, ibn, ath, am, s, kitab, al, futuh, shaykh, al, mufid, s, kitab, al, irshad, and, abu, al, faraj, al, isfahani, s, maqatil, al, talibiyyin, most, of, these, sources, took, material, from, abu, mikhnaf, in, addition, to, some, from, the, primary, works, of, awana, al, mada, ini, and, nasr, ibn, muzahim, although, tabari, and, other, early, sources, contain, some, miraculous, stories, these, sources, are, mainly, historical, and, rational, in, nature, in, contrast, to, the, literature, of, later, periods, which, is, mainly, hagiographical, in, nature, the, battle, of, karbala, was, also, reported, by, an, early, christian, source, a, history, by, the, syriac, christian, scholar, theophilus, of, edessa, who, was, chief, astrologer, in, the, abbasid, court, between, 775, and, 785, is, partially, preserved, in, a, number, of, extant, christian, chronicles, including, those, by, michael, the, syrian, and, the, byzantine, historian, theophanes, the, confessor, husayn, ibn, ali, s, tomb, is, located, in, the, city, of, karbala, about, 90, km, southwest, of, baghdad, this, tomb, was, probably, formed, two, centuries, after, the, event, of, karbala, and, was, rebuilt, and, expanded, until, the, thirteenth, century, ah, this, place, did, not, have, a, building, at, first, and, was, marked, with, a, simple, sign, after, that, in, the, third, century, ah, a, monument, was, built, on, it, which, was, considered, during, the, time, of, some, abbasid, caliphs, and, dailami, princes, and, patriarchal, and, ottoman, rulers, and, over, time, the, city, of, karbala, was, built, and, expanded, around, it, there, are, several, narrations, about, the, burial, place, of, imam, husayn, s, head, for, example, with, his, father, ali, in, najaf, outside, kufa, but, not, with, ali, in, karbala, with, his, whole, body, in, baqiya, in, an, unknown, place, in, damascus, in, raqqa, syria, and, in, a, mosque, mohsen, al, amin, in, cairo, shi, a, muslims, consider, pilgrimages, to, husayn, s, tomb, to, be, a, source, of, divine, blessings, and, rewards, according, to, shi, a, tradition, the, first, such, visit, was, performed, by, husayn, s, son, ali, al, sajjad, and, the, surviving, family, members, during, their, return, from, syria, to, medina, the, first, historically, recorded, visit, is, sulayman, ibn, surad, and, the, penitents, going, to, husayn, s, grave, before, their, departure, to, syria, they, are, reported, to, have, lamented, and, beaten, their, chests, and, to, have, spent, a, night, by, the, tomb, thereafter, this, tradition, was, limited, to, the, shi, a, imams, for, several, decades, before, gaining, momentum, under, the, sixth, shi, a, imam, jafar, sadiq, and, his, followers, buyids, and, safavids, also, encouraged, this, practice, special, visits, are, paid, on, 10, muharram, ashura, pilgrimage, and, 40, days, after, the, anniversary, of, husayn, s, arba, in, pilgrimage, in, shi, a, tradition, husayn, s, martyrdom, is, also, connected, to, the, hagiography, of, john, the, baptist, the, soil, of, karbala, is, considered, to, have, miraculous, healing, effects, mourning, for, husayn, is, considered, by, shi, as, to, be, a, source, of, salvation, in, the, afterlife, and, is, undertaken, as, a, remembrance, of, his, suffering, after, the, death, of, husayn, when, his, family, was, being, taken, to, ibn, ziyad, husayn, s, sister, zaynab, is, reported, to, have, cried, out, after, seeing, his, headless, body, o, muhammad, here, is, husayn, in, the, open, stained, with, blood, and, with, limbs,

an, important, effect, in, the, invoking, the, memory, of, karbala, as, these, help, consolidate, the, collective, identity, and, memory, of, the, shi, a, community, anthropologist, michael, fischer, states, that, commemoration, of, the, battle, of, karbala, by, the, shi, a, is, not, only, the, retelling, of, the, story, but, also, presents, them, with, life, models, and, norms, of, behavior, which, are, applicable, to, all, aspects, of, life, which, he, calls, the, karbala, paradigm, according, to, olmo, g, lz, the, karbala, paradigm, provide, shi, as, with, heroic, norms, and, a, martyr, ethos, and, represents, an, embodiment, of, the, battle, between, good, and, evil, justice, and, injustice, rituals, involving, self, flagellation, have, been, criticized, by, many, shi, a, scholars, as, they, are, considered, to, be, innovative, practices, iranian, supreme, leader, ayatollah, ali, khamenei, has, banned, the, practice, in, iran, since, 1994, husayn, s, first, marriage, was, with, rubab, her, father, imra, al, qais, a, chief, of, banu, kalb, came, to, medina, during, the, caliphate, of, umar, and, was, appointed, by, him, as, the, chief, of, the, quda, a, tribes, ali, proposed, her, marriage, with, husayn, but, since, husayn, and, imra, al, qais, s, daughter, were, too, young, at, the, time, the, actual, marriage, took, place, later, husayn, had, a, daughter, amena, or, amina, or, omayma, who, is, known, as, sakinah, from, her, according, to, a, narration, recorded, by, abu, al, faraj, al, isfahani, hasan, has, blamed, husayn, for, his, excessive, favors, to, rubab, husayn, in, response, depicted, his, great, love, for, rubab, and, sakinah, in, three, lines, of, poetry, later, on, rubab, bore, a, son, abd, allah, or, according, to, recent, shia, sources, ali, al, asghar, for, him, husayn, s, kunya, abu, abd, allah, probably, refers, to, this, son, after, husayn, s, death, rubab, spent, a, year, in, grief, at, his, grave, and, refused, to, marry, again, according, to, madelung, husayn, had, two, sons, named, ali, the, older, one, ali, al, sajjad, who, became, the, fourth, shia, imam, later, was, 23, years, old, when, his, younger, brother, ali, al, akbar, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, karbala, at, the, age, of, 19, ali, al, akbar, was, born, from, layla, the, daughter, of, abi, murrah, al, thaqafi, who, was, an, ally, of, the, umayyads, husayn, s, marriage, with, layla, according, to, madelung, probably, had, material, benefits, for, husayn, ali, al, sajjad, s, mother, on, the, other, hand, was, a, slave, probably, from, sind, named, az, la, sol, fa, sal, ma, hzan, n, or, shahrbanu, according, to, the, reports, commonly, accepted, by, shia, she, was, the, daughter, of, yazdegerd, iii, the, last, sassanid, king, of, iran, to, be, captured, during, the, arab, conquest, on, the, other, hand, in, narrative, sources, mistakes, and, confusion, have, been, made, between, ali, al, asghar, and, abd, allah, contemporary, shiite, circles, have, carefully, identified, sajjad, as, ali, al, awsat, and, ali, al, asghar, as, an, infant, in, karbala, among, these, children, abd, allah, known, by, the, mention, of, his, name, in, the, events, of, ashura, is, considered, the, other, son, of, husayn, according, to, madelung, although, early, sunni, sources, refer, to, ali, al, sajjad, as, ali, al, asghar, and, ali, ii, as, ali, al, akbar, it, is, probably, true, that, sheikh, mufid, and, other, shi, ite, writers, are, correct, in, stating, the, opposite, ali, ii, was, killed, in, karbala, at, the, age, of, 19, his, mother, is, layla, the, daughter, of, abi, murrah, ibn, urwah, al, thaqafi, and, maymuna, bint, abi, sufyan, the, sister, of, mu, awiya, according, to, madelung, after, hasan, s, peace, with, mu, awiya, husayn, married, layla, from, whom, ali, al, akbar, was, born, umm, ishaq, the, daughter, of, talha, was, another, wife, of, husayn, who, had, previously, married, hasan, despite, her, allegedly, bad, character, hasan, was, pleased, with, her, and, asked, his, younger, brother, husayn, to, marry, her, when, he, himself, died, husayn, did, so, and, had, a, daughter, from, her, named, fatima, who, later, married, with, hasan, ibn, hasan, hasan, and, husayn, were, the, only, male, descendants, of, the, muhammad, from, whom, the, next, generations, were, born, hence, any, person, who, says, that, his, lineage, goes, back, to, the, muhammad, is, either, related, to, hasan, or, to, husayn, hasan, and, husayn, are, different, in, this, respect, from, their, half, brothers, such, as, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyya, husayn, had, a, white, face, and, sometimes, wore, a, green, turban, and, sometimes, a, black, turban, he, would, travel, with, the, poor, or, invite, them, to, his, house, and, feed, them, mu, awiya, said, about, husayn, that, he, and, his, father, ali, were, not, deceitful, and, amr, ibn, al, as, considered, him, the, most, beloved, of, the, earthlings, to, the, people, of, heaven, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, islam, one, of, the, moral, characteristics, of, husayn, is, tolerance, humility, eloquence, and, finally, traits, that, can, be, deduced, from, his, behavior, such, as, despising, death, hatred, of, a, shameful, life, pride, and, the, like, in, many, narrations, the, resemblance, of, husayn, and, his, brother, to, muhammad, is, mentioned, and, each, of, them, is, likened, to, half, of, their, grandfather, s, behavior, husayn, is, described, as, looking, like, his, grandfather, muhammad, though, not, as, much, as, his, older, brother, hasan, according, to, madelung, husayn, was, similar, to, his, father, ali, while, hasan, had, the, temperament, of, muhammad, and, criticized, the, policies, of, his, father, ali, madelung, cites, the, fact, that, hasan, named, two, of, his, sons, muhammad, and, did, not, name, any, of, them, ali, and, that, husayn, named, two, of, his, four, sons, ali, and, did, not, name, either, muhammad, as, proof, of, this, claim, rasool, jafarian, considers, the, narrations, in, which, husayn, is, like, ali, and, hasan, is, like, muhammad, to, be, fake, according, to, him, the, image, presented, in, these, narrations, could, have, been, used, to, destroy, the, image, of, ali, and, ashura, and, to, be, useful, to, those, who, were, in, favor, of, uthman, tendencies, according, to, the, shia, scholar, muhammad, husayn, tabatabai, the, opinion, of, some, commentators, about, the, difference, in, taste, between, hasan, and, husayn, is, misplaced, because, despite, not, swearing, allegiance, to, yazid, husayn, like, his, brother, spent, ten, years, in, mu, awiya, s, rule, and, never, opposed, it, mohammad, emadi, haeri, believes, that, husayn, is, considered, to, be, similar, to, muhammad, in, most, sources, and, in, one, narration, the, most, similar, to, him, there, is, also, a, narration, that, ali, considers, hussein, to, be, the, most, similar, person, in, terms, of, behavior, husayn, was, known, for, his, generosity, in, medina, and, he, freed, his, slaves, and, maids, if, they, saw, any, good, behavior, there, is, a, narration, that, mu, awiyah, sent, a, maid, to, husayn, with, a, lot, of, property, and, clothes, when, the, maid, recited, verses, from, the, qur, an, and, a, poem, about, the, instability, of, the, world, and, the, death, of, man, husayn, set, her, free, and, gave, her, property, once, one, of, husayn, s, slaves, did, something, wrong, but, after, the, slave, recited, the, verse, husayn, forgave, him, and, after, that, the, slave, recited, the, verse, and, husayn, released, the, slave, because, of, this, there, is, a, narration, that, husayn, gave, the, property, and, goods, that, he, inherited, before, receiving, them, husayn, gave, his, children, s, teacher, a, large, sum, of, money, and, clothes, while, acknowledging, that, this, does, not, compensate, for, the, value, of, the, teacher, s, work, a, levantine, man, once, cursed, husayn, and, ali, but, husayn, forgave, him, and, treated, him, with, kindness, it, is, said, that, the, place, of, the, food, bags, that, husayn, carried, for, the, poor, was, obvious, on, his, body, on, the, day, of, ashura, many, sunni, and, shia, a, commentators, such, as, fakhr, razi, and, muhammad, husayn, tabataba, i, in, their, interpretation, of, surah, al, insan, attribute, its, revelation, to, ali, and, fatima, and, the, story, of, the, illness, of, their, child, or, children, and, a, vow, for, their, recovery, muhammad, husayn, tabataba, i, in, tafsir, al, mizan, said, the, event, of, the, mubahala, tells, the, story, of, the, confrontation, between, the, prophet, of, islam, and, his, family, on, the, one, hand, and, the, christians, of, najran, on, the, other, tabatabai, says, that, according, to, the, narrations, the, meaning, of, our, sons, in, the, verse, of, mubahila, was, hassan, and, husayn, many, sunni, commentators, have, also, stated, that, the, people, in, it, are, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, in, interpreting, the, verse, of, purification, in, al, mizan, tabatabai, considers, the, addressee, of, this, verse, to, be, the, ahl, al, kisa, and, refers, to, its, hadiths, which, number, more, than, seventy, hadiths, and, are, mostly, from, the, sunnis, sunni, commentators, such, as, fakhr, razi, and, ibn, kathir, in, their, commentary, while, narrating, various, narrations, about, the, example, of, ahl, al, bayt, in, this, verse, consider, ali, fatima, hasan, and, husayn, as, examples, in, the, explanation, and, interpretation, of, verse, 23, of, surah, ash, shura, tabatabai, in, al, mizan, while, reporting, and, criticizing, the, various, sayings, of, the, commentators, has, said, that, the, meaning, of, nearness, is, the, love, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, of, muhammad, that, is, ali, is, fatima, hassan, and, husayn, he, goes, on, to, cite, various, narrations, from, sunnis, and, shiites, that, have, clarified, this, issue, sunni, commentators, such, as, fakhr, al, razi, and, ibn, kathir, have, also, referred, to, this, issue, verse, 15, of, surah, al, ahqaf, talks, about, a, pregnant, woman, who, endures, a, lot, of, pain, and, suffering, this, verse, is, considered, a, reference, to, fatima, zahra, and, the, son, is, also, known, as, husayn, when, god, expressed, his, condolences, to, muhammad, about, the, fate, of, this, grandson, and, muhammad, expressed, this, to, fatima, zahra, she, was, very, upset, other, verses, that, the, shiites, attribute, to, husayn, include, verse, 6, of, surah, al, ahzab, and, 28, of, surah, az, zukhruf, which, have, been, interpreted, to, mean, the, continuation, of, the, imamate, from, his, generation, also, verses, such, as, 77, surah, an, nisa, 33, surah, al, isra, and, 27th, to, 30th, surah, al, fajr, refer, to, the, uprising, and, killing, of, husayn, from, the, shiite, point, of, view, husayn, is, placed, as, an, example, for, the, second, weight, in, the, narrations, related, to, thaqalin, in, another, group, of, narrations, related, to, hasnain, they, are, introduced, as, the, master, of, the, youth, of, paradise, his, name, and, hassan, s, due, to, their, young, age, are, among, those, who, pledge, allegiance, in, renewing, allegiance, to, the, prophet, which, indicates, the, prophet, s, goal, in, strengthening, their, historical, and, social, status, there, are, narrations, that, gabriel, informed, muhammad, at, the, time, of, husayn, s, birth, that, his, ummah, would, kill, husayn, and, that, the, imamate, would, be, from, husayn, and, that, muhammad, informed, his, companions, of, how, husayn, had, been, killed, except, for, muhammad, ali, and, hasan, they, had, said, the, same, thing, god, also, informed, the, previous, prophets, about, the, killing, of, husayn, ali, also, knew, that, husayn, would, be, killed, in, karbala, and, once, he, passed, by, this, area, he, stopped, and, cried, and, remembered, the, news, of, muhammad, he, interpreted, karbala, as, anguish, and, calamity, the, slain, of, karbala, will, enter, paradise, without, any, reckoning, there, are, narrations, sermons, and, letters, left, from, husayn, ibn, ali, which, are, available, in, sunni, and, shiite, sources, narrations, about, him, can, be, divided, into, two, periods, before, and, after, the, imamate, in, the, first, period, which, is, the, period, of, his, life, in, the, life, of, his, grandfather, father, mother, and, brother, there, are, at, least, two, types, of, narrations, about, him, first, his, narrations, from, his, relatives, and, second, his, personal, hadiths, in, sunni, sources, only, the, aspect, of, the, narration, of, his, hadith, has, been, considered, in, these, hadiths, these, musnads, like, the, musnad, of, the, companions, of, the, prophet, of, islam, also, have, a, musnad, named, husayn, ibn, ali, in, his, musnad, abu, bakr, bazar, has, narrated, the, musnad, of, husayn, ibn, ali, with, 4, hadiths, and, tabarani, has, narrated, his, musnad, with, 27, hadiths, respectively, in, the, musnad, of, husayn, ibn, ali, in, addition, to, the, hadiths, of, husayn, himself, there, are, also, hadiths, of, the, prophet, of, islam, and, ali, ibn, abi, talib, in, the, present, era, azizullah, atardi, has, compiled, the, document, of, the, imam, of, the, martyr, abi, abdullah, al, husayn, ibn, ali, in, the, category, of, sermons, of, husayn, ibn, ali, there, are, some, sermons, of, him, in, the, pre, imamate, period, some, of, which, are, very, famous, thus, the, sermon, of, husayn, ibn, ali, after, public, allegiance, to, ali, ibn, abi, talib, and, others, is, his, sermon, in, the, battle, of, safin, another, example, is, a, poem, by, husayn, about, the, loss, of, his, brother, hasan, after, his, burial, the, sermons, and, letters, of, husayn, ibn, ali, during, his, imamate, are, more, than, before, him, his, letters, to, the, shiites, as, well, as, his, letters, to, mu, awiyah, regarding, his, adherence, to, the, peace, treaty, trace, mu, awiyah, s, actions, especially, regarding, yazid, as, well, as, his, sermons, and, letters, in, the, form, of, letters, of, recommendation, at, the, beginning, of, yazid, s, caliphate, an, important, part, of, the, sermons, and, letters, belong, to, the, period, of, the, uprising, of, husayn, bin, ali, correspondence, with, kufis, basrians, and, people, like, muslim, ibn, aqeel, is, like, this, hadiths, on, the, subjects, of, jurisprudence, interpretation, beliefs, rulings, and, sermons, supplications, advice, and, poetry, also, remain, from, husayn, which, are, scattered, in, shiite, and, sunni, sources, and, have, been, compiled, and, published, in, the, form, of, collections, there, are, also, prayers, left, by, husayn, ibn, ali, which, have, been, published, in, the, form, of, collections, entitled, al, sahifa, al, husayn, or, prays, of, imam, al, husayn, one, of, the, most, famous, shia, prayers, as, well, as, the, works, of, husayn, recorded, in, the, book, mafatih, al, janan, is, the, du, a, arafah, according, to, william, c, chittick, this, prayer, is, the, most, famous, prayer, in, terms, of, its, beauty, and, spiritual, structure, and, is, recited, every, year, on, the, day, of, arafah, and, during, the, hajj, season, that, is, when, it, was, first, recited, by, husayn, ibn, ali, by, shia, pilgrims, this, prayer, has, a, special, and, important, role, in, shia, theology, and, mulla, sadra, the, philosopher, and, mystic, has, referred, to, this, prayer, many, times, in, his, works, the, killing, of, husayn, has, had, an, emotional, impact, on, sunnis, who, remember, the, event, as, a, tragic, incident, and, those, killed, in, the, company, of, husayn, as, martyrs, the, impact, on, shi, a, islam, has, been, much, deeper, according, to, vaglieri, only, the, adherents, of, the, umayyad, who, considered, him, as, a, rebel, against, the, established, authority, condoned, his, murder, by, yazid, but, their, opinion, was, opposed, by, the, majority, of, muslims, therefore, almost, all, muslims, consider, husayn, honorable, because, he, was, the, grandson, of, muhammad, and, because, of, the, belief, that, he, sacrificed, himself, for, an, ideal, historian, edward, gibbon, described, the, events, at, karbala, as, a, tragedy, according, to, historian, syed, akbar, hyder, mahatma, gandhi, attributed, the, historical, progress, of, islam, to, the, sacrifices, of, muslim, saints, like, husayn, rather, than, military, force, the, positive, attitude, of, the, sunnis, towards, husayn, according, to, vaglieri, is, most, likely, due, to, the, sad, narrations, that, abu, mikhnaf, has, collected, some, of, which, have, been, narrated, directly, or, with, short, chains, of, transmitters, mostly, from, kufis, who, regretted, their, actions, towards, husayn, these, sad, narrations, of, the, kufis, which, were, a, sign, of, abu, mikhnaf, s, shia, tendencies, became, the, source, of, the, narrations, used, by, later, historians, and, spread, throughout, the, islamic, world, according, to, rasul, jafarian, the, shia, historian, fatalism, being, promoted, by, mu, awiya, caused, husayn, s, move, to, never, be, considered, an, uprising, against, corruption, by, the, sunnis, and, they, only, considered, it, an, illegal, insurrection, fitna, the, most, important, components, of, shia, views, about, husayn, are, the, belief, in, the, imamate, of, husayn, and, the, characteristics, of, an, imam, by, the, shia, religions, twelvers, ismailis, and, zaydis, like, other, imams, husayn, is, a, mediator, with, god, for, those, who, call, on, him, it, is, through, his, intercession, tawassul, that, his, faithful, followers, obtain, guidance, and, attain, salvation, as, a, member, of, holy, five, he, receives, all, the, divine, grace, that, exist, in, his, older, brother, hasan, also, as, the, grandson, of, muhammad, according, to, vaglieri, the, basis, of, the, shias, glorification, of, husayn, is, his, outstanding, sacred, and, moral, action, and, the, noble, ideals, to, which, he, sacrificed, himself, from, the, belief, that, the, imams, know, all, that, was, that, is, and, that, is, to, come, and, that, their, knowledge, does, not, increase, with, time, it, is, inferred, that, husayn, already, knew, the, fate, that, awaited, him, and, his, followers, hence, he, left, mecca, for, kufa, aware, of, his, imminent, sacrifice, and, yet, without, any, hesitation, or, attempt, to, escape, the, will, of, god, a, narration, according, to, which, husayn, was, called, by, god, to, choose, between, sacrifice, and, victory, with, the, help, of, an, angel, gives, even, more, value, to, his, enterprise, about, the, reason, for, husayn, s, sacrifice, in, shia, sources, vaglieri, write, husayn, gave, his, person, and, his, possessions, as, an, offering, to, god, to, revive, the, religion, of, his, grandfather, muhammad, to, redeem, it, and, save, it, from, the, destruction, into, which, it, had, been, thrown, by, the, behaviour, of, yazid, furthermore, he, wished, to, show, that, the, conduct, of, the, hypocrites, was, shameful, and, to, teach, the, peoples, the, necessity, of, revolt, against, unjust, and, impious, governments, fasiks, in, short, he, offered, himself, as, an, example, uswa, to, the, muslim, community, he, is, thus, remembered, as, the, prince, of, martyrs, sayyed, al, shuhada, the, historian, g, r, hawting, describes, the, battle, of, karbala, as, a, supreme, example, of, suffering, and, martyrdom, for, shi, as, according, to, abdulaziz, sachedina, it, is, seen, by, shi, as, the, climax, of, suffering, and, oppression, revenge, for, which, came, to, be, one, of, the, primary, goals, of, many, shi, a, uprisings, this, revenge, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, fundamental, objectives, of, the, future, revolution, of, the, twelfth, shi, a, imam, muhammad, al, mahdi, whose, return, is, awaited, with, his, return, husayn, and, his, seventy, two, companions, are, expected, to, be, resurrected, along, with, their, killers, who, will, then, be, punished, believing, that, husayn, wanted, to, redeem, people, from, their, sins, with, his, blood, and, that, his, action, was, a, redemptive, sacrifice, for, the, salvation, of, the, world, according, to, vaglieri, is, foreign, to, shia, belief, however, it, may, have, been, penetrated, to, shia, ta, zieh, and, recent, poems, later, on, since, it, is, easy, to, make, the, transition, from, tawassul, to, this, idea, or, it, may, be, influenced, by, christian, ideas, among, the, verses, that, interpreted, by, some, shia, sources, as, referring, to, husayn, is, qur, an, 46, 15, which, talks, about, a, pregnant, mother, fatima, the, mother, of, husayn, who, suffers, a, lot, when, god, expressed, his, condolences, to, muhammad, about, the, fate, of, this, grandson, and, muhammad, expressed, this, to, fatima, thus, she, was, very, upset, according, to, another, narration, the, mysterious, letters, of, k, h, y, a, s, at, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, chapter, of, the, qur, an, maryam, surah, refers, to, husayn, and, his, fate, in, karbala, that, was, similar, to, the, fate, of, john, the, baptist, who, was, also, beheaded, and, his, head, was, placed, on, a, plate, it, is, also, narrated, that, ali, knew, that,
