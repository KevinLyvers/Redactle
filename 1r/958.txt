whose, views, became, the, basis, of, arminianism, and, the, dutch, remonstrant, movement, he, served, from, 1603, as, professor, in, theology, at, the, university, of, leiden, and, wrote, many, books, and, treatises, on, theology, following, his, death, his, challenge, to, the, reformed, standard, the, belgic, confession, provoked, ample, discussion, at, the, synod, of, dort, which, crafted, the, five, points, of, calvinism, in, response, to, arminius, s, teaching, jakob, hermanszoon, was, born, in, 1559, or, 1560, in, oudewater, utrecht, he, became, an, orphan, while, still, young, his, father, herman, a, manufacturer, of, weapons, died, leaving, his, wife, a, widow, with, small, children, he, never, knew, his, father, and, his, mother, was, killed, during, the, spanish, massacre, at, oudewater, in, 1575, the, child, was, adopted, by, theodorus, aemilius, a, priest, inclined, towards, protestantism, around, 1572, the, year, oudewater, was, conquered, by, the, rebels, arminius, and, aemilius, settled, in, utrecht, the, young, jacobus, studied, there, probably, at, the, hieronymusschool, after, the, death, of, aemilius, 1574, or, 1575, arminius, became, acquainted, with, the, mathematician, rudolph, snellius, also, from, oudewater, the, latter, brought, arminius, to, marburg, and, enabled, him, to, study, at, the, leiden, university, where, he, taught, in, 1576, arminius, was, registered, as, a, liberal, arts, student, at, the, newly, opened, leiden, university, arminius, remained, a, student, at, leiden, from, 1576, to, 1582, although, he, enrolled, as, a, student, in, liberal, arts, this, allowed, him, to, pursue, an, education, in, theology, as, well, his, teachers, in, theology, included, calvinist, lambertus, danaeus, hebrew, scholar, johannes, drusius, guillaume, feuguereius, or, feugueires, d, 1613, and, johann, kolmann, kolmann, is, now, known, for, teaching, that, the, overemphasis, of, god, s, sovereignty, in, high, calvinism, made, god, a, tyrant, and, an, executioner, although, the, university, in, leiden, was, solidly, reformed, it, had, influences, from, lutheran, zwinglian, and, anabaptist, views, in, addition, to, calvinism, one, leiden, pastor, caspar, coolhaes, held, contra, calvin, that, civil, authorities, did, have, jurisdiction, in, some, church, affairs, that, it, was, wrong, to, punish, and, execute, heretics, and, that, lutherans, calvinists, and, anabaptists, could, unite, around, core, tenets, the, astronomer, and, mathematician, willebrord, snellius, used, ramist, philosophy, in, an, effort, to, encourage, his, students, to, pursue, truth, without, over, reliance, on, aristotle, under, the, influence, of, these, men, arminius, studied, with, success, and, may, have, had, seeds, planted, that, would, begin, to, develop, into, a, theology, that, would, later, question, the, dominant, reformed, theology, of, john, calvin, the, success, he, showed, in, his, studies, motivated, the, merchants, guild, of, amsterdam, to, fund, the, next, three, years, of, his, studies, in, 1582, arminius, began, studying, under, theodore, beza, at, geneva, he, found, himself, under, pressure, for, using, ramist, philosophical, methods, familiar, to, him, from, his, time, at, leiden, arminius, was, publicly, forbidden, to, teach, ramean, philosophy, after, this, difficult, state, of, affairs, he, moved, to, basel, to, continue, his, studies, he, continued, to, distinguish, himself, there, as, an, excellent, student, in, 1583, arminius, was, contemplating, a, return, to, geneva, when, the, theological, faculty, at, basel, spontaneously, offered, him, a, doctorate, he, declined, the, honor, on, account, of, his, youth, he, was, about, 24, and, returned, to, the, school, in, geneva, to, finish, his, schooling, in, geneva, under, beza, upon, the, conclusion, of, arminius, studies, and, a, request, for, him, to, pastor, in, amsterdam, beza, replied, to, leaders, in, amsterdam, with, this, letter, let, it, be, known, to, you, that, from, the, time, arminius, returned, to, us, from, basel, his, life, and, learning, both, have, so, approved, themselves, to, us, that, we, hope, for, the, best, from, him, in, every, respect, if, he, steadily, persists, in, the, same, course, which, by, the, blessing, of, god, we, doubt, not, he, will, for, among, other, endowments, god, has, given, him, an, intellect, well, suited, both, to, the, apprehension, and, to, the, discrimination, of, things, if, this, henceforward, be, regulated, by, piety, which, he, appears, assiduously, to, cultivate, it, cannot, but, happen, that, this, power, of, intellect, when, consolidated, by, mature, age, and, experience, will, be, productive, of, the, richest, fruits, such, is, our, opinion, of, arminius, a, young, man, unquestionably, so, far, as, we, are, able, to, judge, most, worthy, of, your, kindness, and, liberality, letter, of, 3, june, 1585, from, beza, to, amsterdam, from, this, letter, it, would, seem, that, the, earlier, tension, from, arminius, attraction, to, ramist, philosophy, had, dissipated, and, arminius, was, known, even, to, beza, as, an, excellent, though, budding, theologian, three, months, later, john, grynaeus, at, the, university, of, basel, sent, this, letter, of, commendation, to, pious, readers, greeting, inasmuch, as, a, faithful, testimonial, of, learning, and, piety, ought, not, to, be, refused, to, any, learned, and, pious, man, so, neither, to, james, arminius, a, native, of, amsterdam, for, his, deportment, while, he, attended, the, university, of, basel, was, marked, by, piety, moderation, and, assiduity, in, study, and, very, often, in, the, course, of, our, theological, discussions, he, made, his, gift, of, a, discerning, spirit, so, manifest, to, all, of, us, as, to, elicit, from, us, well, merited, congratulations, more, recently, too, in, certain, extraordinary, prelections, delivered, with, the, consent, and, by, the, order, of, the, theological, faculty, in, which, he, publicly, expounded, a, few, chapters, of, the, epistle, to, the, romans, he, gave, us, the, best, ground, to, hope, that, he, was, destined, erelong, if, indeed, he, goes, on, to, stir, up, the, gift, of, god, that, is, in, him, to, undertake, and, sustain, the, function, of, teaching, to, which, he, may, be, lawfully, set, apart, with, much, fruit, to, the, church, i, commend, him, accordingly, to, all, good, men, and, in, particular, to, the, church, of, god, in, the, famous, city, of, amsterdam, and, i, respectfully, entreat, that, regard, may, be, had, to, that, learned, and, pious, youth, so, that, he, may, never, be, under, the, necessity, of, intermitting, theological, studies, which, have, been, thus, far, so, happily, prosecuted, farewell, john, james, grynaeus, professor, of, sacred, literature, and, dean, of, the, theological, faculty, written, with, mine, own, hand, basle, 3rd, september, 1583, arminius, answered, the, call, to, pastor, at, amsterdam, in, 1587, delivering, sunday, and, midweek, sermons, after, being, tested, by, the, church, leaders, he, was, ordained, in, 1588, he, gained, a, reputation, as, a, good, preacher, and, faithful, pastor, one, of, arminius, first, tasks, was, given, to, him, by, ecclesiastical, court, of, amsterdam, namely, to, refute, the, teachings, of, dirck, volckertszoon, coornhert, who, rejected, beza, s, supralapsarian, doctrine, of, god, s, absolute, and, unconditional, decree, to, create, men, so, as, to, save, some, and, damn, others, based, on, nothing, in, themselves, the, discussion, had, already, begun, with, two, ministers, at, delft, who, had, written, an, answer, to, certain, arguments, of, beza, and, calvin, from, a, treatise, on, predestination, as, taught, in, the, ninth, chapter, of, romans, a, document, which, contradicted, both, beza, and, coornhert, they, proposed, that, although, god, s, decree, to, save, only, some, was, indeed, absolute, and, unconditional, it, had, occurred, after, the, fall, proposing, infralapsarianism, rather, than, beza, s, supralapsarianism, arminius, was, tasked, with, refuting, both, coornhert, and, infralapsarianism, theology, he, readily, agreed, to, the, task, but, after, greater, study, found, himself, in, conflict, over, the, matter, he, determined, to, spend, greater, time, in, study, before, continuing, his, refutation, in, 1590, he, married, lijsbet, reael, the, daughter, of, laurens, jacobsz, reael, a, prominent, merchant, and, poet, in, amsterdam, who, also, helped, lead, the, protestant, reformation, and, later, helped, establish, the, first, reformed, church, in, the, area, arminius, s, marriage, to, reael, allowed, him, access, to, her, prestigious, connections, and, he, made, many, friends, in, the, merchant, industry, and, high, society, he, was, commissioned, to, organize, the, educational, system, of, amsterdam, and, is, said, to, have, done, it, well, he, greatly, distinguished, himself, by, faithfulness, to, his, duties, in, 1602, during, a, plague, that, swept, through, amsterdam, going, into, infected, houses, that, others, did, not, dare, to, enter, in, order, to, give, them, water, and, supplying, their, neighbors, with, funds, to, care, for, them, at, amsterdam, arminius, taught, through, a, number, of, sermons, on, the, epistle, of, the, romans, in, discussing, romans, 7, in, 1591, he, taught, that, man, through, grace, and, rebirth, did, not, have, to, live, in, bondage, to, sin, and, that, romans, 7, 14, was, speaking, of, a, man, living, under, the, law, and, convicted, of, sin, by, the, holy, spirit, yet, not, presently, regenerated, this, was, met, with, some, resistance, and, some, detractors, labeled, him, pelagian, for, teaching, that, an, unregenerate, man, could, feel, such, conviction, and, desire, for, salvation, even, with, the, influence, of, the, law, and, the, holy, spirit, in, the, same, year, responding, to, arminius, theological, positions, his, colleague, petrus, plancius, began, to, dispute, him, openly, during, a, gathering, of, ministers, arminius, insisted, he, was, not, teaching, anything, in, contradiction, to, the, heidelberg, confession, and, other, standards, of, orthodoxy, that, early, church, theologians, held, similar, views, and, that, he, utterly, repudiated, the, heresy, of, pelagianism, further, arminius, expressed, some, astonishment, that, he, was, not, to, be, allowed, to, interpret, this, passage, according, to, the, dictates, of, his, own, conscience, and, within, the, pattern, of, historic, orthodoxy, the, amsterdam, burgomasters, intervened, in, an, effort, to, keep, the, peace, and, tamp, down, divisions, in, the, populace, urging, them, to, peacefully, coexist, and, for, arminius, to, teach, nothing, out, of, accord, with, the, reformed, thought, agreed, upon, at, the, time, unless, he, had, consulted, with, the, church, council, or, other, bodies, during, the, following, years, controversy, emerged, as, he, preached, through, romans, 9, although, he, did, not, directly, contradict, calvinist, interpretations, he, focused, on, paul, s, theme, of, justification, by, faith, in, contradiction, to, works, rather, than, focusing, on, god, s, eternal, decrees, during, this, time, he, gradually, developed, opinions, on, grace, predestination, and, free, will, that, were, inconsistent, with, the, doctrine, of, the, reformed, teachers, calvin, and, beza, in, 1603, he, was, called, back, to, leiden, university, to, teach, theology, this, came, about, after, almost, simultaneous, deaths, in, 1602, of, two, faculty, members, franciscus, junius, and, lucas, trelcatius, the, elder, in, an, outbreak, of, plague, lucas, trelcatius, the, younger, and, arminius, despite, plancius, protest, were, appointed, the, decision, resting, largely, with, franciscus, gomarus, the, surviving, faculty, member, while, gomarus, cautiously, approved, arminius, whose, views, were, already, suspected, of, unorthodoxy, his, arrival, opened, a, period, of, debate, rather, than, closed, it, the, appointment, had, also, a, political, dimension, being, backed, by, both, johannes, uytenbogaert, at, the, hague, and, johan, van, oldenbarnevelt, gomarus, a, fleming, who, had, been, in, leiden, since, 1594, has, been, described, as, a, rather, mediocre, scholar, but, a, forceful, defender, of, the, calvinistic, doctrine, a, man, of, deep, rooted, faith, in, contrast, arminius, has, been, described, as, a, seeker, a, doubter, on, the, question, of, predestination, gomarus, was, a, supralapsarian, and, it, was, in, debate, over, this, point, that, the, conflict, between, the, two, began, arminius, advocated, revising, the, belgic, confession, and, the, heidelberg, catechism, but, was, not, explicit, until, much, later, when, the, debate, became, an, open, conflict, the, dispute, took, a, public, turn, on, 7, february, 1604, when, willem, bastingius, in, his, disputation, de, divina, praedestinatione, defended, a, number, of, arminius, s, theses, arminius, himself, presiding, this, event, led, gomarus, to, have, samuel, gruterus, argue, an, opposite, position, to, these, theses, on, 14, october, 1604, but, not, on, the, official, schedule, gomarus, ascribed, the, positions, he, disliked, to, calvin, s, adversary, sebastian, castellio, and, his, follower, dirck, volckertszoon, coornhert, while, arminius, pointed, to, the, bible, to, defend, his, positions, the, calvinist, views, set, forth, by, the, genevan, patriarchs, gradually, acquired, the, force, of, res, judicata, so, that, resistance, against, it, was, no, longer, tolerated, opponents, of, arminius, outside, the, university, gradually, expanded, the, controversy, the, classis, in, dordrecht, drew, up, a, gravamen, in, which, some, differences, that, were, said, to, have, arisen, in, the, church, and, university, of, leiden, on, the, doctrine, of, the, reformed, churches, was, laid, out, in, response, the, three, leiden, professors, of, theology, lucas, trelcatius, jr, joining, arminius, and, gomarus, and, the, regent, of, the, state, college, johannes, cuchlinus, wrote, an, indignant, letter, stating, that, as, far, as, was, known, to, them, there, was, no, conflict, between, the, professors, on, any, fundamental, doctrine, whatsoever, gomarus, was, incited, to, increase, his, opposition, to, arminius, by, leiden, minister, festus, hommius, and, petrus, plancius, arminius, s, old, opponent, an, anonymous, series, of, thirty, one, articles, was, circulated, in, which, all, kinds, of, unorthodox, opinions, held, by, arminius, were, exposed, sibrandus, lubbertus, professor, of, theology, at, the, university, of, franeker, began, sending, letters, to, foreign, theologians, attacking, arminius, with, charges, of, heresy, and, one, of, these, letters, fell, into, arminius, s, hands, because, his, opponents, remained, anonymous, or, bypassed, official, procedures, arminius, in, april, 1608, requested, from, the, states, of, holland, permission, to, expound, his, views, on, 30, may, 1608, arminius, and, gomarus, were, allowed, by, the, states, to, deliver, speeches, before, the, supreme, court, in, the, hague, the, chief, justice, of, the, supreme, court, reinout, van, brederode, oldenbarnevelt, s, son, in, law, concluded, that, the, points, of, difference, between, the, two, professors, mostly, relating, to, the, subtle, details, of, doctrine, of, predestination, were, of, minor, importance, and, could, co, exist, enjoined, both, gentlemen, to, tolerate, one, another, lovingly, in, direct, defiance, of, the, court, gomarus, then, published, the, speech, he, had, made, before, it, and, arminius, followed, suit, by, publishing, his, own, speech, in, response, to, the, court, s, opinion, gomarus, declared, that, he, would, not, dare, die, holding, arminius, opinion, nor, to, appear, with, it, before, god, s, judgement, seat, arminius, then, asked, to, defend, his, positions, in, public, or, for, a, national, or, provincial, synod, to, be, called, to, examine, the, matter, seeking, to, avoid, a, synod, the, states, of, holland, allowed, arminius, to, expound, on, his, views, to, their, assembly, on, 30, october, 1608, before, the, assembly, arminius, finally, explained, his, call, to, rewrite, the, belgic, confession, and, the, heidelberg, catechism, saying, that, he, did, not, feel, obligated, to, explain, his, position, before, for, as, a, professor, he, considered, himself, subject, only, to, the, authority, of, the, leiden, curators, and, the, states, not, to, the, church, arminius, then, gave, an, overview, of, all, the, various, opinions, existing, on, predestination, he, claimed, that, supralapsarianism, was, contrary, to, the, confession, and, catechism, and, that, supra, and, infralapsarianism, basically, amount, to, the, same, thing, arminius, put, forward, his, own, view, on, predestination, which, he, held, was, in, concordance, with, the, confession, and, the, catechism, learning, that, arminius, had, appeared, before, the, states, assembly, gomarus, requested, permission, to, address, it, as, well, which, was, granted, on, 12, december, 1608, gomarus, blasted, arminius, accusing, his, colleague, of, being, a, supporter, of, pelagianism, and, the, jesuits, he, also, attacked, johannes, wtenbogaert, whom, he, branded, a, courtly, trumpeter, the, assembly, took, offence, against, this, polemical, tone, which, contrasted, with, arminius, s, eirenicism, and, ordered, the, speeches, made, before, them, by, both, men, to, be, banned, from, publication, despite, the, ban, the, speeches, soon, appeared, in, print, on, 25, july, 1609, jacobus, bontebal, defended, the, theses, de, vocatione, hominis, ad, salutem, under, arminius, s, presidency, a, roman, catholic, priest, rumored, to, be, a, jesuit, was, in, the, audience, and, dared, to, oppose, arminius, positions, while, an, already, seriously, ill, arminius, refuted, the, arguments, gomarus, who, was, among, the, audience, became, alternately, flushing, and, deathly, pale, and, afterwards, while, the, papist, was, within, earshot, he, insultingly, remarked, to, his, colleague, that, now, the, door, to, papism, had, been, widely, opened, arminius, remained, as, a, teacher, at, leiden, until, his, death, and, was, valued, by, his, students, still, the, conflict, with, gomarus, widened, out, into, a, large, scale, split, within, calvinism, of, the, local, clergy, adrianus, borrius, supported, arminius, while, festus, hommius, opposed, him, close, friends, students, and, supporters, of, arminius, included, johannes, drusius, conrad, vorstius, anthony, thysius, johannes, halsbergius, petrus, bertius, johannes, arnoldi, corvinus, the, brothers, rembert, and, simon, episcopius, his, successor, at, leiden, again, selected, with, the, support, of, uytenbogaert, and, oldenbarnevelt, was, vorstius, a, past, influence, on, arminius, by, his, writings, once, again, the, states, attempted, to, tamp, down, the, growing, controversy, without, calling, a, synod, arminius, was, ordered, to, attend, another, conference, with, gomarus, in, the, hague, in, on, 13, 14, august, 1609, when, the, conference, was, to, reconvene, on, 18, august, arminius, health, began, to, fail, and, so, he, returned, to, leiden, the, states, suspended, the, conference, and, asked, both, men, for, a, written, reaction, to, their, adversary, s, viewpoint, arminius, died, on, 19, october, 1609, at, his, house, at, the, pieterskerkhof, he, was, buried, in, the, pieterskerk, at, leiden, where, a, memorial, stone, on, his, behalf, was, placed, in, 1934, in, attempting, to, defend, calvinistic, predestination, against, the, teachings, of, dirck, volckertszoon, coornhert, arminius, began, to, doubt, aspects, of, calvinism, and, modified, some, parts, of, his, own, view, he, attempted, to, reform, calvinism, and, lent, his, name, to, a, movement, arminianism, which, resisted, some, of, the, calvinist, tenets, unconditional, election, the, nature, of, the, limitation, of, the, atonement, and, irresistible, grace, the, early, dutch, followers, of, his, teaching, became, known, as, remonstrants, after, they, issued, a, document, containing, five, points, of, disagreement, with, mainstream, calvinism, entitled, remonstranti, 1610, arminius, wrote, that, he, sought, to, teach, only, those, things, which, could, be, proved, from, the, scriptures, and, that, tended, toward, edification, among, christians, with, the, exception, of, roman, catholics, with, whom, he, said, there, could, be, no, spiritual, accord, his, motto, was, reputed, to, be, bona, conscientia, paradisus, meaning, a, good, conscience, is, a, paradise, arminius, taught, of, a, preventing, or, prevenient, grace, that, has, been, conferred, upon, all, by, the, holy, spirit, and, this, grace, is, sufficient, for, belief, in, spite, of, our, sinful, corruption, and, thus, for, salvation, arminius, stated, that, the, grace, sufficient, for, salvation, is, conferred, on, the, elect, and, on, the, non, elect, that, if, they, will, they, may, believe, or, not, believe, may, be, saved, or, not, be, saved, william, witt, states, that, arminius, has, a, very, high, theology, of, grace, he, insists, emphatically, that, grace, is, gratuitous, because, it, is, obtained, through, god, s, redemption, in, christ, not, through, human, effort, the, theology, of, arminianism, did, not, become, fully, developed, during, arminius, lifetime, but, after, his, death, 1609, the, five, articles, of, the, remonstrants, 1610, systematized, and, formalized, the, ideas, but, the, calvinist, synod, of, dort, 1618, 19, convening, for, the, purpose, of, condemning, arminius, theology, declared, it, and, its, adherents, anathemas, defined, the, five, points, of, calvinism, and, persecuted, arminian, pastors, who, remained, in, the, netherlands, but, in, spite, of, persecution, the, remonstrants, continued, in, holland, as, a, distinct, church, and, again, and, again, where, calvinism, was, taught, arminianism, raised, its, head, publishers, in, leiden, 1629, and, at, frankfurt, 1631, and, 1635, issued, the, works, of, arminius, in, latin, john, wesley, 1703, 91, the, founder, of, the, methodist, movement, came, to, his, own, religious, beliefs, while, in, college, and, through, his, aldersgate, experience, or, epiphany, and, expressed, himself, strongly, against, the, doctrines, of, calvinistic, election, and, reprobation, his, system, of, thought, has, become, known, as, wesleyan, arminianism, the, foundations, of, which, were, laid, by, wesley, and, his, fellow, preacher, john, william, fletcher, although, wesley, knew, very, little, about, the, beliefs, of, jacobus, arminius, and, arrived, at, his, religious, views, independently, of, arminius, wesley, acknowledged, late, in, life, with, the, 1778, publication, of, the, arminian, magazine, that, he, and, arminius, were, in, general, agreement, theology, professor, w, stephen, gunther, concludes, he, was, a, faithful, representative, of, arminius, beliefs, wesley, was, perhaps, the, clearest, english, proponent, of, arminianism, he, embraced, arminian, theology, and, became, its, most, prominent, champion, today, the, majority, of, methodists, remain, committed, knowingly, or, unknowingly, to, arminian, theology, and, arminianism, itself, has, become, one, of, the, dominant, theological, systems, in, the, united, states, thanks, in, large, part, to, the, influence, of, john, and, charles, wesley, arminius, and, his, wife, lijsbet, laurensdochtor, reael, who, married, in, 1590, had, a, total, of, 12, children, three, of, whom, died, young, during, infancy, they, had, ten, sons, harmen, b, 1594, pieter, b, 1596, jan, b, 1598, laurens, b, 1600, died, in, infancy, laurens, b, 1601, jacob, b, 1603, willem, b, 1605, and, daniel, b, 1606, they, had, two, other, sons, who, also, died, in, infancy, whose, names, are, not, part, of, the, public, record, their, daughters, were, engelte, b, 1593, and, geertruyd, b, 1608, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, and, children, when, he, died
