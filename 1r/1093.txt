which, he, believed, the, shamanic, supreme, deity, tengri, had, destined, him, the, mongol, army, under, genghis, killed, millions, of, people, yet, his, conquests, also, facilitated, unprecedented, commercial, and, cultural, exchange, over, a, vast, geographical, area, he, is, remembered, as, a, backwards, savage, tyrant, in, russia, and, the, arab, world, while, recent, western, scholarship, has, begun, to, reassess, its, previous, view, of, him, as, a, barbarian, warlord, he, was, posthumously, deified, in, mongolia, modern, mongolians, recognise, him, as, the, founding, father, of, their, nation, there, is, no, universal, romanisation, system, used, for, mongolian, as, a, result, modern, spellings, of, mongolian, names, vary, greatly, and, may, result, in, considerably, different, pronunciations, from, the, original, the, honorific, most, commonly, rendered, as, genghis, ultimately, derives, from, the, mongolian, which, may, be, romanised, as, inggis, this, was, adapted, into, chinese, as, ch, ngj, s, and, into, persian, as, ng, z, as, arabic, lacks, a, sound, similar, to, represented, in, the, mongolian, and, persian, romanisations, by, writers, transcribed, the, name, as, j, ingiz, while, syriac, authors, used, ng, z, in, addition, to, genghis, introduced, into, english, during, the, 18th, century, based, on, a, misreading, of, persian, sources, modern, english, spellings, include, chinggis, chingis, jinghis, and, jengiz, his, birth, name, tem, jin, ti, m, zh, n, is, sometimes, also, spelled, temuchin, in, english, when, genghis, s, grandson, kublai, khan, established, the, yuan, dynasty, in, 1271, he, bestowed, the, temple, name, taizu, meaning, supreme, progenitor, and, the, posthumous, name, shengwu, huangdi, meaning, holy, martial, emperor, upon, his, grandfather, kublai, s, great, grandson, k, l, g, khan, later, expanded, this, title, into, fatian, qiyun, shengwu, huangdi, meaning, interpreter, of, the, heavenly, law, initiator, of, the, good, fortune, holy, martial, emperor, as, the, sources, are, written, in, more, than, a, dozen, languages, from, across, eurasia, modern, historians, have, found, it, difficult, to, compile, information, on, the, life, of, genghis, khan, all, accounts, of, his, adolescence, and, rise, to, power, derive, from, two, mongolian, language, sources, the, secret, history, of, the, mongols, and, the, altan, debter, golden, book, the, latter, now, lost, served, as, inspiration, for, two, chinese, chronicles, the, 14th, century, history, of, yuan, and, the, shengwu, qinzheng, lu, campaigns, of, genghis, khan, the, history, of, yuan, while, poorly, edited, provides, a, large, amount, of, detail, on, individual, campaigns, and, people, the, shengwu, is, more, disciplined, in, its, chronology, but, does, not, criticise, genghis, and, occasionally, contains, errors, the, secret, history, survived, through, being, transliterated, into, chinese, characters, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, its, historicity, has, been, disputed, the, 20th, century, sinologist, arthur, waley, considered, it, a, literary, work, with, no, historiographical, value, but, more, recent, historians, have, given, the, work, much, more, credence, although, it, is, clear, that, the, work, s, chronology, is, suspect, and, that, some, passages, were, removed, or, modified, for, better, narration, the, secret, history, is, valued, highly, because, the, anonymous, author, is, often, critical, of, genghis, khan, in, addition, to, presenting, him, as, indecisive, and, as, having, a, phobia, of, dogs, the, secret, history, also, recounts, taboo, events, such, as, his, fratricide, and, the, possibility, of, his, son, jochi, s, illegitimacy, multiple, chronicles, in, persian, have, also, survived, which, display, a, mix, of, positive, and, negative, attitudes, towards, genghis, khan, and, the, mongols, both, minhaj, i, siraj, juzjani, and, ata, malik, juvayni, completed, their, respective, histories, in, 1260, juzjani, was, an, eyewitness, to, the, brutality, of, the, mongol, conquests, and, the, hostility, of, his, chronicle, reflects, his, experiences, his, contemporary, juvayni, who, had, travelled, twice, to, mongolia, and, attained, a, high, position, in, the, administration, of, a, mongol, successor, state, was, more, sympathetic, his, account, is, the, most, reliable, for, genghis, khan, s, western, campaigns, the, most, important, persian, source, is, the, jami, al, tawarikh, compendium, of, chronicles, compiled, by, rashid, al, din, on, the, order, of, genghis, s, descendant, ghazan, in, the, early, 14th, century, ghazan, allowed, rashid, privileged, access, to, both, confidential, mongol, sources, such, as, the, altan, debter, and, to, experts, on, the, mongol, oral, tradition, including, kublai, khan, s, ambassador, bolad, chingsang, as, he, was, writing, an, official, chronicle, rashid, censored, inconvenient, or, taboo, details, there, are, many, other, contemporary, histories, which, include, additional, information, on, genghis, khan, and, the, mongols, although, their, neutrality, and, reliability, are, often, suspect, additional, chinese, sources, include, the, chronicles, of, the, dynasties, conquered, by, the, mongols, and, the, song, diplomat, zhao, hong, who, visited, the, mongols, in, 1221, arabic, sources, include, a, contemporary, biography, of, the, khwarazmian, prince, jalal, al, din, by, his, companion, al, nasawi, there, are, also, several, later, christian, chronicles, including, the, georgian, chronicles, and, works, by, european, travellers, such, as, carpini, and, marco, polo, the, year, of, tem, jin, s, birth, is, disputed, as, historians, favour, different, dates, 1155, 1162, or, 1167, some, traditions, place, his, birth, in, the, year, of, the, pig, which, was, either, 1155, or, 1167, while, a, dating, to, 1155, is, supported, by, the, writings, of, both, zhao, hong, and, rashid, al, din, other, major, sources, such, as, the, history, of, yuan, and, the, shengwu, favour, the, year, 1162, the, 1167, dating, favoured, by, the, sinologist, paul, pelliot, is, derived, from, a, minor, source, a, text, of, the, yuan, artist, yang, weizhen, but, is, more, compatible, with, the, events, of, genghis, khan, s, life, than, a, 1155, placement, which, implies, that, he, did, not, have, children, until, after, the, age, of, thirty, and, continued, actively, campaigning, into, his, seventh, decade, 1162, is, the, date, accepted, by, most, historians, the, historian, paul, ratchnevsky, noted, that, tem, jin, himself, may, not, have, known, the, truth, the, location, of, tem, jin, s, birth, which, the, secret, history, records, as, del, n, boldog, on, the, onon, river, is, similarly, debated, it, has, been, placed, at, either, dadal, in, khentii, province, or, in, southern, agin, buryat, okrug, russia, tem, jin, was, born, into, the, borjigin, clan, of, the, mongol, tribe, to, yes, gei, a, chieftain, who, claimed, descent, from, the, legendary, warlord, bodonchar, munkhag, and, his, principal, wife, h, el, n, originally, of, the, olkhonud, clan, whom, yes, gei, had, abducted, from, her, merkit, bridegroom, chiledu, the, origin, of, his, birth, name, is, contested, the, earliest, traditions, hold, that, his, father, had, just, returned, from, a, successful, campaign, against, the, tatars, with, a, captive, named, tem, chin, uge, after, whom, he, named, the, newborn, in, celebration, of, his, victory, while, later, traditions, highlight, the, root, tem, r, meaning, iron, and, connect, to, theories, that, tem, jin, means, blacksmith, several, legends, surround, tem, jin, s, birth, the, most, prominent, is, that, he, was, born, clutching, a, blood, clot, in, his, hand, a, motif, in, asian, folklore, indicating, the, child, would, be, a, warrior, others, claimed, that, h, el, n, was, impregnated, by, a, ray, of, light, which, announced, the, child, s, destiny, a, legend, which, echoed, that, of, the, mythical, borjigin, ancestor, alan, gua, yes, gei, and, h, el, n, had, three, younger, sons, after, tem, jin, qasar, hachiun, and, tem, ge, as, well, as, one, daughter, tem, l, n, tem, jin, also, had, two, half, brothers, behter, and, belgutei, from, yes, gei, s, secondary, wife, sochigel, whose, identity, is, uncertain, the, siblings, grew, up, at, yesugei, s, main, camp, on, the, banks, of, the, onon, where, they, learned, how, to, ride, a, horse, and, shoot, a, bow, when, tem, jin, was, eight, years, old, his, father, decided, to, betroth, him, to, a, suitable, girl, yes, gei, took, his, heir, to, the, pastures, of, h, el, n, s, prestigious, onggirat, tribe, which, had, intermarried, with, the, mongols, on, many, previous, occasions, there, he, arranged, a, betrothal, between, tem, jin, and, b, rte, the, daughter, of, an, onggirat, chieftain, named, dei, sechen, as, the, betrothal, meant, yes, gei, would, gain, a, powerful, ally, and, as, b, rte, commanded, a, high, bride, price, dei, sechen, held, the, stronger, negotiating, position, and, demanded, that, tem, jin, remain, in, his, household, to, work, off, his, future, debt, accepting, this, condition, yes, gei, requested, a, meal, from, a, band, of, tatars, he, encountered, while, riding, homewards, alone, relying, on, the, steppe, tradition, of, hospitality, to, strangers, however, the, tatars, recognised, their, old, enemy, and, slipped, poison, into, his, food, yes, gei, gradually, sickened, but, managed, to, return, home, close, to, death, he, requested, a, trusted, retainer, called, m, nglig, to, retrieve, tem, jin, from, the, onggirat, he, died, soon, after, yes, gei, s, death, shattered, the, unity, of, his, people, which, included, members, of, the, borjigin, tayichiud, and, other, clans, as, tem, jin, was, not, yet, ten, and, behter, around, two, years, older, neither, was, considered, experienced, enough, to, rule, the, tayichiud, faction, excluded, h, el, n, from, the, ancestor, worship, ceremonies, which, followed, a, ruler, s, death, and, soon, abandoned, her, camp, the, secret, history, relates, that, the, entire, borjigin, clan, followed, despite, h, el, n, s, attempts, to, shame, them, into, staying, by, appealing, to, their, honour, rashid, al, din, and, the, shengwu, however, imply, that, yes, gei, s, brothers, stood, by, the, widow, it, is, possible, that, h, el, n, may, have, refused, to, join, in, levirate, marriage, with, one, resulting, in, later, tensions, or, that, the, author, of, the, secret, history, dramatised, the, situation, all, the, sources, agree, that, most, of, yes, gei, s, people, renounced, his, family, in, favour, of, the, tayichiuds, and, that, h, el, n, s, family, were, reduced, to, a, much, harsher, life, taking, up, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, they, collected, roots, and, nuts, hunted, for, small, animals, and, caught, fish, tensions, developed, as, the, children, grew, older, both, tem, jin, and, behter, had, claims, to, be, their, father, s, heir, although, tem, jin, was, the, child, of, yes, gei, s, chief, wife, behter, was, at, least, two, years, his, senior, there, was, even, the, possibility, that, as, permitted, under, levirate, law, behter, could, marry, h, el, n, upon, attaining, his, majority, and, become, tem, jin, s, stepfather, as, the, friction, exacerbated, by, frequent, disputes, over, the, division, of, hunting, spoils, intensified, tem, jin, and, his, younger, brother, qasar, ambushed, and, killed, behter, this, taboo, act, was, omitted, from, the, official, chronicles, but, not, from, the, secret, history, which, recounts, that, h, el, n, angrily, reprimanded, her, sons, behter, s, younger, full, brother, belgutei, did, not, seek, vengeance, and, became, one, of, tem, jin, s, highest, ranking, followers, alongside, qasar, around, this, time, tem, jin, developed, a, close, friendship, with, jamukha, another, boy, of, aristocratic, descent, the, secret, history, notes, that, they, exchanged, knucklebones, and, arrows, as, gifts, and, swore, the, anda, pact, the, traditional, oath, of, mongol, blood, brothers, at, eleven, as, the, family, lacked, allies, tem, jin, was, taken, prisoner, on, multiple, occasions, captured, by, the, tayichiuds, he, escaped, during, a, feast, and, hid, first, in, the, onon, and, then, in, the, tent, of, sorkan, shira, a, man, who, had, seen, him, in, the, river, and, not, raised, the, alarm, sorkan, shira, sheltered, tem, jin, for, three, days, at, great, personal, risk, before, helping, him, to, escape, tem, jin, was, assisted, on, another, occasion, by, bo, orchu, an, adolescent, who, aided, him, in, retrieving, stolen, horses, soon, afterwards, bo, orchu, joined, tem, jin, s, camp, as, his, first, n, kor, personal, companion, pl, n, kod, these, incidents, related, by, the, secret, history, are, indicative, of, the, emphasis, its, author, put, on, genghis,

in, central, mongolia, but, distrusted, many, of, his, followers, in, need, of, loyal, replacements, he, was, delighted, with, the, valuable, gift, and, welcomed, tem, jin, into, his, protection, the,

of, 20, 000, warriors, and, with, jamukha, in, command, the, campaign, was, soon, won, a, now, pregnant, b, rte, was, recovered, successfully, and, soon, gave, birth, to, a, son, jochi, although, tem, jin, raised, him, as, his, own, questions, over, his, true, paternity, followed, jochi, throughout, his, life, this, is, narrated, in, the, secret, history, and, contrasts, with, rashid, al, din, s, account, which, protects, the, family, s, reputation, by, removing, any, hint, of, illegitimacy, over, the, next, decade, and, a, half, tem, jin, and, b, rte, had, three, more, sons, chagatai, gedei, and, tolui, and, four, more, daughters, checheyigen, alaqa, t, mel, n, and, al, altan, the, followers, of, tem, jin, and, jamukha, camped, together, for, a, year, and, a, half, during, which, their, leaders, reforged, their, anda, pact, and, slept, together, under, one, blanket, according, to, the, secret, history, the, source, presents, this, period, as, close, friends, bonding, but, ratchnevsky, questioned, if, tem, jin, actually, entered, into, jamukha, s, service, in, return, for, the, assistance, with, the, merkits, tensions, arose, and, the, two, leaders, parted, ostensibly, on, account, of, a, cryptic, remark, made, by, jamukha, on, the, subject, of, camping, in, any, case, tem, jin, followed, the, advice, of, h, el, n, and, b, rte, and, began, to, build, an, independent, following, the, major, tribal, rulers, remained, with, jamukha, but, forty, one, leaders, gave, their, support, to, tem, jin, along, with, many, commoners, these, included, subutai, and, others, of, the, uriankhai, the, barulas, the, olkhonuds, and, many, more, many, were, attracted, by, tem, jin, s, reputation, as, a, fair, and, generous, lord, who, could, offer, better, lives, while, his, shamans, prophesied, that, heaven, had, allocated, him, a, great, destiny, tem, jin, was, soon, acclaimed, by, his, close, followers, as, khan, of, the, mongols, toghrul, was, pleased, at, his, vassal, s, elevation, but, jamukha, was, resentful, tensions, escalated, into, open, hostility, and, in, around, 1187, the, two, leaders, clashed, in, battle, at, dalan, baljut, the, two, forces, were, evenly, matched, but, tem, jin, suffered, a, clear, defeat, later, chroniclers, including, rashid, al, din, instead, state, that, he, was, victorious, but, their, accounts, contradict, themselves, and, each, other, modern, historians, such, as, ratchnevsky, and, timothy, may, consider, it, very, likely, that, tem, jin, spent, a, large, portion, of, the, decade, following, the, clash, at, dalan, baljut, as, a, servant, of, the, jurchen, jin, dynasty, in, north, china, zhao, hong, recorded, that, the, future, genghis, khan, spent, several, years, as, a, slave, of, the, jin, formerly, seen, as, an, expression, of, nationalistic, arrogance, the, statement, is, now, thought, to, be, based, in, fact, especially, as, no, other, source, convincingly, explains, tem, jin, s, activities, between, dalan, baljut, and, c, 1195, taking, refuge, across, the, border, was, a, common, practice, both, for, disaffected, steppe, leaders, and, disgraced, chinese, officials, tem, jin, s, reemergence, having, retained, significant, power, indicates, that, he, probably, profited, in, the, service, of, the, jin, as, he, later, overthrew, that, state, such, an, episode, detrimental, to, mongol, prestige, was, omitted, from, all, their, sources, zhao, hong, was, bound, by, no, such, taboos, the, sources, do, not, agree, on, the, events, of, tem, jin, s, return, to, the, steppe, in, early, summer, 1196, he, participated, in, a, joint, campaign, with, the, jin, against, the, tatars, who, had, begun, to, act, contrary, to, jin, interests, as, a, reward, the, jin, awarded, him, the, honorific, cha, ut, kuri, the, meaning, of, which, probably, approximated, commander, of, hundreds, in, jurchen, at, around, the, same, time, he, assisted, toghrul, with, reclaiming, the, lordship, of, the, kereit, which, had, been, usurped, by, one, of, toghrul, s, relatives, with, the, support, of, the, powerful, naiman, tribe, the, actions, of, 1196, fundamentally, changed, tem, jin, s, position, in, the, steppe, although, nominally, still, toghrul, s, vassal, he, was, de, facto, an, equal, ally, jamukha, behaved, cruelly, following, his, victory, at, dalan, baljut, he, allegedly, boiled, seventy, prisoners, alive, and, humiliated, the, corpses, of, leaders, who, had, opposed, him, a, number, of, disaffected, followers, including, yes, gei, s, follower, m, nglig, and, his, sons, defected, to, tem, jin, as, a, consequence, they, were, also, probably, attracted, by, his, newfound, wealth, tem, jin, subdued, the, disobedient, jurkin, tribe, that, had, previously, offended, him, at, a, feast, and, refused, to, participate, in, the, tatar, campaign, after, executing, their, leaders, he, had, belgutei, symbolically, break, a, leading, jurkin, s, back, in, a, staged, wrestling, match, in, retribution, this, latter, incident, which, contravened, mongol, customs, of, justice, was, only, noted, by, the, author, of, the, secret, history, who, openly, disapproved, these, events, occurred, c, 1197, during, the, following, years, tem, jin, and, toghrul, campaigned, against, the, merkits, the, naimans, and, the, tatars, sometimes, separately, and, sometimes, together, in, around, 1201, a, collection, of, dissatisfied, tribes, including, the, onggirat, the, tayichiud, and, the, tatars, swore, to, break, the, domination, of, the, borjigin, kereit, alliance, electing, jamukha, as, their, leader, and, gurkhan, lit, khan, of, the, tribes, after, some, initial, successes, tem, jin, and, toghrul, routed, this, loose, confederation, at, yedi, qunan, and, jamukha, was, forced, to, beg, for, toghrul, s, clemency, desiring, complete, supremacy, in, eastern, mongolia, tem, jin, defeated, first, the, tayichiud, and, then, in, 1202, the, tatars, after, both, campaigns, he, executed, the, clan, leaders, and, took, the, remaining, warriors, into, his, service, these, included, sorkan, shira, who, had, come, to, his, aid, previously, and, a, young, warrior, named, jebe, who, by, killing, tem, jin, s, horse, and, refusing, to, hide, that, fact, had, displayed, martial, ability, and, personal, courage, the, absorption, of, the, tatars, left, three, military, powers, in, the, steppe, the, naimans, in, the, west, the, mongols, in, the, east, and, the, kereit, in, between, seeking, to, cement, his, position, tem, jin, proposed, that,

loyalty, later, known, as, the, baljuna, covenant, to, his, faithful, followers, which, subsequently, granted, them, great, prestige, the, oath, takers, of, baljuna, were, a, very, heterogeneous, group, men, from, nine, different, tribes, who, included, christians, muslims, and, buddhists, united, only, by, loyalty, to, tem, jin, and, to, each, other, this, group, became, a, model, for, the, later, empire, termed, a, proto, government, of, a, proto, nation, by, historian, john, man, the, baljuna, covenant, was, omitted, from, the, secret, history, as, the, group, was, predominantly, non, mongol, the, author, presumably, wished, to, downplay, the, role, of, other, tribes, a, ruse, de, guerre, involving, qasar, allowed, the, mongols, to, ambush, the, kereit, at, the, jej, er, heights, but, though, the, ensuing, battle, still, lasted, three, days, it, ended, in, a, decisive, victory, for, tem, jin, toghrul, and, senggum, were, both, forced, to, flee, and, while, the, latter, escaped, to, tibet, toghrul, was, killed, by, a, naiman, who, did, not, recognise, him, tem, jin, sealed, his, victory, by, absorbing, the, kereit, elite, into, his, own, tribe, he, took, the, princess, ibaqa, as, a, wife, and, married, her, sister, sorghaghtani, and, niece, doquz, to, his, youngest, son, tolui, the, ranks, of, the, naimans, had, swelled, due, to, the, arrival, of, jamukha, and, others, defeated, by, the, mongols, and, they, prepared, for, war, tem, jin, was, informed, of, these, events, by, alaqush, the, sympathetic, ruler, of, the, ongud, tribe, in, may, 1204, at, the, battle, of, chakirmaut, in, the, altai, mountains, the, naimans, were, decisively, defeated, their, leader, tayang, khan, was, killed, and, his, son, kuchlug, was, forced, to, flee, west, the, merkits, were, decimated, later, that, year, while, jamukha, who, had, abandoned, the, naimans, at, chakirmaut, was, betrayed, to, tem, jin, by, companions, who, were, executed, for, their, lack, of, loyalty, according, to, the, secret, history, jamukha, convinced, his, childhood, anda, to, execute, him, honourably, other, accounts, state, that, he, was, killed, by, dismemberment, now, sole, ruler, of, the, steppe, tem, jin, held, a, large, assembly, called, a, kurultai, at, the, source, of, the, onon, river, in, 1206, here, he, formally, adopted, the, title, genghis, khan, the, etymology, and, meaning, of, which, have, been, much, debated, some, commentators, hold, that, the, title, had, no, meaning, simply, representing, tem, jin, s, eschewal, of, the, traditional, gurkhan, title, which, had, been, accorded, to, jamukha, and, was, thus, of, lesser, worth, another, theory, suggests, that, the, word, genghis, bears, connotations, of, strength, firmness, hardness, or, righteousness, a, third, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, title, is, related, to, the, turkic, t, ngiz, ocean, the, title, genghis, khan, would, mean, master, of, the, ocean, and, as, the, ocean, was, believed, to, surround, the, earth, the, title, thus, ultimately, implied, universal, ruler, having, attained, control, over, one, million, people, genghis, khan, began, a, social, revolution, in, may, s, words, as, traditional, tribal, systems, had, primarily, evolved, to, benefit, small, clans, and, families, they, were, unsuitable, as, the, foundations, for, larger, states, and, had, been, the, downfall, of, previous, steppe, confederations, genghis, thus, began, a, series, of, administrative, reforms, designed, to, suppress, the, power, of, tribal, affiliations, and, to, replace, them, with, unconditional, loyalty, to, the, khan, and, the, ruling, family, as, most, of, the, traditional, tribal, leaders, had, been, killed, during, his, rise, to, power, genghis, was, able, to, reconstruct, the, mongol, social, hierarchy, in, his, favour, the, highest, tier, was, occupied, solely, by, his, and, his, brothers, families, who, became, known, as, the, altan, uruq, lit, golden, family, or, chaghan, yasun, lit, white, bone, underneath, them, came, the, qara, yasun, lit, black, bone, sometimes, qarachu, composed, of, the, surviving, pre, empire, aristocracy, and, the, most, important, of, the, new, families, to, break, any, concept, of, tribal, loyalty, mongol, society, was, reorganised, into, a, military, decimal, system, every, man, between, the, age, of, fifteen, and, seventy, was, conscripted, into, a, minqan, pl, minkad, a, unit, of, a, thousand, soldiers, which, was, further, subdivided, into, units, of, hundreds, jaghun, pl, jaghat, and, tens, arban, pl, arbat, the, units, also, encompassed, each, man, s, household, meaning, that, each, military, minqan, was, supported, by, a, minqan, of, households, in, what, may, has, termed, a, military, industrial, complex, each, minqan, operated, as, both, a, political, and, social, unit, while, the, warriors, of, defeated, tribes, were, dispersed, to, different, minqad, to, make, it, difficult, for, them, to, rebel, as, a, single, body, this, was, intended, to, ensure, the, disappearance, of, old, tribal, identities, replacing, them, with, loyalty, to, the, great, mongol, state, and, to, commanders, who, had, gained, their, rank, through, merit, and, loyalty, to, the, khan, this, particular, reform, proved, extremely, effective, even, after, the, division, of, the, mongol, empire, fragmentation, never, happened, along, tribal, lines, instead, the, descendants, of, genghis, continued, to, reign, unchallenged, in, some, cases, until, as, late, as, the, 1700s, and, even, powerful, non, imperial, dynasts, such, as, timur, and, edigu, were, compelled, to, rule, from, behind, a, puppet, ruler, of, his, lineage, genghis, s, senior, n, kod, were, appointed, to, the, highest, ranks, and, received, the, greatest, honours, bo, orchu, and, muqali, were, each, given, ten, thousand, men, to, lead, as, commanders, of, the, right, and, left, wings, of, the, army, respectively, the, other, n, kod, were, each, given, commands, of, one, of, the, ninety, five, minkad, in, a, display, of, genghis, meritocratic, ideals, many, of, these, men, were, born, to, low, social, status, ratchnevsky, cited, jelme, and, subutai, the, sons, of, blacksmiths, in, addition, to, a, carpenter, a, shepherd, and, even, the, two, herdsmen, who, had, warned, tem, jin, of, toghrul, s, plans, in, 1203, as, a, special, privilege, genghis, allowed, certain, loyal, commanders, to, retain, the, tribal, identities, of, their, units, alaqush, of, the, ongud, was, allowed, to, retain, five, thousand, warriors, of, his, tribe, because, his, son, had, entered, into, an, alliance, pact, with, genghis, marrying, his, daughter, alaqa, a, key, tool, which, underpinned, these, reforms, was, the, expansion, of, the, keshig, bodyguard, after, tem, jin, defeated, toghrul, in, 1203, he, had, appropriated, this, kereit, institution, in, a, minor, form, but, at, the, 1206, kurultai, its, numbers, were, greatly, expanded, from, 1, 150, to, 10, 000, men, the, keshig, was, not, only, the, khan, s, bodyguard, but, his, household, staff, a, military, academy, and, the, centre, of, governmental, administration, all, the, warriors, in, this, elite, corps, were, brothers, or, sons, of, military, commanders, and, were, essentially, hostages, the, members, of, the, keshig, nevertheless, received, special, privileges, and, direct, access, to, the, khan, whom, they, served, and, who, in, return, evaluated, their, capabilities, and, their, potential, to, govern, or, command, commanders, such, as, subutai, chormaqan, and, baiju, all, started, out, in, the, keshig, before, being, given, command, of, their, own, force, from, 1204, to, 1209, genghis, khan, was, predominantly, focused, on, consolidating, and, maintaining, his, new, nation, he, faced, a, challenge, from, the, shaman, kokechu, whose, father, m, nglig, had, been, allowed, to, marry, h, el, n, after, he, defected, to, tem, jin, kokechu, who, had, proclaimed, tem, jin, as, genghis, khan, and, taken, the, tengrist, title, teb, tenggeri, lit, wholly, heavenly, on, account, of, his, sorcery, was, very, influential, among, the, mongol, commoners, and, sought, to, divide, the, imperial, family, genghis, s, brother, qasar, was, the, first, of, kokechu, s, targets, always, distrusted, by, his, brother, qasar, was, humiliated, and, almost, imprisoned, on, false, charges, before, h, el, n, intervened, by, publicly, reprimanding, genghis, nevertheless, kokechu, s, power, steadily, increased, and, he, publicly, shamed, tem, ge, genghis, s, youngest, brother, when, he, attempted, to, intervene, b, rte, saw, that, kokechu, was, a, threat, to, genghis, s, power, and, warned, her, husband, who, still, superstitiously, revered, the, shaman, but, now, recognised, the, political, threat, he, posed, genghis, allowed, tem, ge, to, arrange, kokechu, s, death, and, then, usurped, the, shaman, s, position, as, the, mongols, highest, spiritual, authority, during, these, years, the, mongols, imposed, their, control, on, surrounding, areas, genghis, dispatched, jochi, northwards, in, 1207, to, subjugate, the, hoi, yin, irgen, a, collection, of, tribes, on, the, edge, of, the, siberian, taiga, having, secured, a, marriage, alliance, with, the, oirats, and, defeated, the, yenisei, kyrgyz, he, took, control, of, the, region, s, trade, in, grain, and, furs, as, well, as, its, gold, mines, mongol, armies, also, rode, westwards, defeating, the, naiman, merkit, alliance, on, the, river, irtysh, in, late, 1208, their, khan, was, killed, and, kuchlug, fled, into, central, asia, led, by, barchuk, the, uyghurs, freed, themselves, from, the, suzerainty, of, the, qara, khitai, and, pledged, themselves, to, genghis, in, 1211, as, the, first, sedentary, society, to, submit, to, the, mongols, the, mongols, had, started, raiding, the, border, settlements, of, the, tangut, led, western, xia, kingdom, in, 1205, ostensibly, in, retaliation, for, allowing, senggum, toghrul, s, son, refuge, more, prosaic, explanations, include, rejuvenating, the, depleted, mongol, economy, with, an, influx, of, fresh, goods, and, livestock, or, simply, subjugating, a, semi, hostile, state, to, protect, the, nascent, mongol, nation, most, xia, troops, were, stationed, along, the, southern, and, eastern, borders, of, the, kingdom, to, guard, against, attacks, from, the, song, and, jin, dynasties, respectively, while, its, northern, border, relied, only, on, the, gobi, desert, for, protection, after, a, raid, in, 1207, sacked, the, xia, fortress, of, wulahai, genghis, decided, to, personally, lead, a, full, scale, invasion, in, 1209, wulahai, was, captured, again, in, may, and, the, mongols, advanced, on, the, capital, zhongxing, modern, day, yinchuan, but, suffered, a, reverse, against, a, xia, army, after, a, two, month, stalemate, genghis, broke, the, deadlock, with, a, feigned, retreat, the, xia, forces, were, deceived, out, of, their, defensive, positions, and, overpowered, although, zhongxing, was, now, mostly, undefended, the, mongols, lacked, any, siege, equipment, better, than, crude, battering, rams, and, were, unable, to, progress, the, siege, the, xia, requested, aid, from, the, jin, but, emperor, zhangzong, rejected, the, plea, genghis, s, attempt, to, redirect, the, yellow, river, into, the, city, with, a, dam, initially, worked, but, the, poorly, constructed, earthworks, broke, possibly, breached, by, the, xia, in, january, 1210, and, the, mongol, camp, was, flooded, forcing, them, to, retreat, a, peace, treaty, was, soon, formalised, the, xia, emperor, xiangzong, submitted, and, handed, over, tribute, including, his, daughter, chaka, in, exchange, for, the, mongol, withdrawal, wanyan, yongji, usurped, the, jin, throne, in, 1209, he, had, previously, served, on, the, steppe, frontier, and, genghis, greatly, disliked, him, when, asked, to, submit, and, pay, the, annual, tribute, to, yongji, in, 1210, genghis, instead, mocked, the, emperor, spat, and, rode, away, from, the, jin, envoy, a, challenge, that, meant, war, despite, the, possibility, of, being, outnumbered, eight, to, one, by, 600, 000, jin, soldiers, genghis, had, prepared, to, invade, the, jin, since, learning, in, 1206, that, the, state, was, wracked, by, internal, instabilities, genghis, had, two, aims, to, take, vengeance, for, past, wrongs, committed, by, the, jin, foremost, among, which, was, the, death, of, ambaghai, khan, in, the, mid, 12th, century, and, to, win, the, vast, amounts, of, plunder, his, troops, and, vassals, expected, after, calling, for, a, kurultai, in, march, 1211, genghis, launched, his, invasion, of, jin, china, in, may, reaching, the, outer, ring, of, jin, defences, the, following, month, these, border, fortifications, were, guarded, by, alaqush, s, ongud, who, allowed, the, mongols, to, pass, without, difficulty, the, three, pronged, chevauch, e, aimed, both, to, plunder, and, burn, a, vast, area, of, jin, territory, to, deprive, them, of, supplies, and, popular, legitimacy, and, to, secure, the, mountain, passes, which, allowed, access, to, the, north, china, plain, the, jin, lost, numerous, towns, and, were, hindered, by, a, series, of, defections, the, most, prominent, of, which, led, directly, to, muqali, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, huan, erzhui, in, autumn, 1211, the, campaign, was, halted, in, 1212, when, genghis, was, wounded, by, an, arrow, during, the, unsuccessful, siege, of, xijing, modern, datong, following, this, failure, genghis, set, up, a, corps, of, siege, engineers, which, recruited, 500, jin, experts, over, the, next, two, years, the, defences, of, juyong, pass, had, been, strongly, reinforced, by, the, time, the, conflict, resumed, in, 1213, but, a, mongol, detachment, led, by, jebe, managed, to, infiltrate, the, pass, and, surprise, the, elite, jin, defenders, opening, the, road, to, the, jin, capital, zhongdu, modern, day, beijing, the, jin, administration, began, to, disintegrate, after, the, khitans, a, tribe, subject, to, the, jin, entered, open, rebellion, hushahu, the, commander, of, the, forces, at, xijing, abandoned, his, post, and, staged, a, coup, in, zhongdu, killing, yongji, and, installing, his, own, puppet, ruler, xuanzong, this, governmental, breakdown, was, fortunate, for, genghis, s, forces, emboldened, by, their, victories, they, had, seriously, overreached, and, lost, the, initiative, unable, to, do, more, than, camp, before, zhongdu, s, fortifications, while, his, army, suffered, from, an, epidemic, and, famine, they, resorted, to, cannibalism, according, to, carpini, who, may, have, been, exaggerating, genghis, opened, peace, negotiations, despite, his, commanders, militance, he, secured, tribute, including, 3, 000, horses, 500, slaves, a, jin, princess, and, massive, amounts, of, gold, and, silk, before, lifting, the, siege, and, setting, off, homewards, in, may, 1214, as, the, northern, jin, lands, had, been, ravaged, by, plague, and, war, xuanzong, moved, the, capital, and, imperial, court, 600, kilometres, 370,

he, immediately, prepared, to, return, and, capture, zhongdu, according, to, christopher, atwood, it, was, only, at, this, juncture, that, genghis, decided, to, fully, conquer, northern, china, muqali, captured, numerous, towns, in, liaodong, during, winter, 1214, 15, and, although, the, inhabitants, of, zhongdu, surrendered, to, genghis, on, 31, may, 1215, the, city, was, sacked, when, genghis, returned, to, mongolia, in, early, 1216, muqali, was, left, in, command, in, china, he, waged, a, brutal, but, effective, campaign, against, the, unstable, jin, regime, until, his, death, in, 1223, in, 1207, genghis, had, appointed, a, man, named, qorchi, as, governor, of, the, subdued, hoi, yin, irgen, tribes, in, siberia, appointed, not, for, his, talents, but, for, prior, services, rendered, qorchi, s, tendency, to, abduct, women, as, concubines, for, his, harem, caused, the, tribes, to, rebel, and, take, him, prisoner, in, early, 1216, the, following, year, they, ambushed, and, killed, boroqul, one, of, genghis, s, highest, ranking, n, kod, the, khan, was, livid, at, the, loss, of, his, close, friend, and, prepared, to, lead, a, retaliatory, campaign, eventually, dissuaded, from, this, course, he, dispatched, his, eldest, son, jochi, and, a, d, rbet, commander, they, managed, to, surprise, and, defeat, the, rebels, securing, control, over, this, economically, important,

arbitrary, ruler, who, probably, earned, the, enmity, of, the, native, islamic, populace, whom, he, attempted, to, forcibly, convert, to, buddhism, genghis, reckoned, that, kuchlug, could, be, a, threat, to, his, empire, and, jebe, was, sent, with, an, army, of, 20, 000, cavalry, to, the, city, of, kashgar, he, undermined, kuchlug, s, rule, by, emphasising, the, mongol, policies, of, religious, tolerance, and, gained, the, loyalty, of, the, local, elite, kuchlug, was, forced, to, flee, southwards, to, the, pamir, mountains, but, was, captured, by, local, hunters, jebe, had, him, beheaded, and, paraded, his, corpse, through, qara, khitai, proclaiming, the, end, of, religious, persecution, in, the, region, genghis, had, now, attained, complete, control, of, the, eastern,

were, eager, to, restart, trading, which, had, halted, during, kuchlug, s, rule, the, khwarazmian, ruler, muhammad, ii, dispatched, an, envoy, shortly, after, the, mongol, capture, of, zhongdu, while, genghis, instructed, his, merchants, to, obtain, the, high, quality, textiles, and, steel, of, central, and, western, asia, many, members, of, the, altan, uruq, invested, in, one, particular, caravan, of, 450, merchants, which, set, off, to, khwarazmia, in, 1218, with, a, large, quantity, of, wares, inalchuq, the, governor, of, the, khwarazmian, border, town, of, otrar, decided, to, massacre, the,

in, what, the, historian, peter, golden, terms, an, uneasy, diarchy, while, the, khwarazmian, nobility, and, populace, were, discontented, with, his, warring, and, the, centralisation, of, government, for, these, reasons, and, others, he, declined, to, meet, the, mongols, in, the, field, instead, garrisoning, his, unruly, troops, in, his, major, cities, this, allowed, the, lightly, armoured, highly, mobile, mongol, armies, uncontested, superiority, outside, city, walls, otrar, was, besieged, in, autumn, 1219, the, siege, dragged, on, for, five, months, but, in, february, 1220, the, city,

darya, river, and, another, force, southwards, into, central, transoxiana, while, he, and, tolui, took, the, main, mongol, army, across, the, kyzylkum, desert, surprising, the, garrison, of, bukhara, in, a, pincer, movement, bukhara, s, citadel, was, captured, in, february, 1220, and, genghis, moved, against, muhammad, s, residence, samarkand, which, fell, the, following, month, bewildered, by, the, speed, of, the, mongol, conquests, muhammad, fled, from, balkh, closely, followed, by, jebe, and, subutai, the, two, generals, pursued, the, khwarazmshah, until, he, died, from, dysentry, on, a, caspian, sea, island, in, winter, 1220, 21, having, nominated, his, eldest, son, jalal, al, din, as, his, successor, jebe, and, subutai, then, set, out, on, a, 7, 500, kilometre, 4, 700, mi, expedition, around, the, caspian, sea, later, called, the, great, raid, this, lasted, four, years, and, saw, the, mongols, come, into, contact, with, europe, for, the, first, time, meanwhile, the,

was, weakened, by, arguments, among, his, commanders, and, after, losing, decisively, at, the, battle, of, the, indus, in, november, 1221, he, was, compelled, to, escape, across, the, indus, river, into, india, genghis, s, youngest, son, tolui, was, concurrently, conducting, a, brutal, campaign, in, the, regions, of, khorasan, every, city, that, resisted, was, destroyed, nishapur, merv, and, herat, three, of, the, largest, and, wealthiest, cities, in, the, world, were, all, annihilated, this, campaign, established, genghis, s, lasting, image, as, a, ruthless, inhumane, conqueror, contemporary, persian, historians, placed, the, death, toll, from, the, three, sieges, alone, at, over, 5, 7, million, a, number, regarded, as, grossly, exaggerated, by, modern, scholars, nevertheless, even, a, total, death, toll, of, 1, 25, million, for, the, entire, campaign, as, estimated, by, john, man, would, have, been, a, demographic, catastrophe, genghis, abruptly, halted, his, central, asian, campaigns, in, 1221, initially, aiming, to, return, via, india, genghis, realised, that, the, heat, and, humidity, of, the, south, asian, climate, impeded, his, army, s, skills, while, the, omens, were, additionally, unfavourable, although, the, mongols, spent, much, of, 1222, repeatedly, overcoming, rebellions, in, khorasan, they, withdrew, completely, from, the, region, to, avoid, overextending, themselves, setting, their, new, frontier, on, the, amu, darya, river, during, his, lengthy, return, journey, genghis, prepared, a, new, administrative, division, which, would, govern,

and, spoke, with, the, taoist, patriarch, changchun, in, the, hindu, kush, the, khan, listened, attentively, to, changchun, s, teachings, and, granted, his, followers, numerous, privileges, including, tax, exemptions, and, authority, over, all, monks, throughout, the, empire, a, grant, which, the, taoists, later, used, to, try, to, gain, superiority, over, buddhism, the, usual, reason, given, for, the, halting, of, the, campaign, is, that, the, western, xia, having, declined, to, provide, auxiliaries, for, the, 1219, invasion, had, additionally, disobeyed, muqali, in, his, campaign, against, the, remaining, jin, in, shaanxi, may, has, disputed, this, arguing, that, the, xia, fought, in, concert, with, muqali, until, his, death, in, 1223, when, frustrated, by, mongol, control, and, sensing, an, opportunity, with, genghis, campaigning, in, central, asia, they, ceased, fighting, in, either, case, genghis, initially, attempted, to, resolve, the, situation, diplomatically, but, when, the, xia, elite, failed, to, come, to, an, agreement, on, the, hostages, they, were, to, send, to, the, mongols, he, lost, patience, returning, to, mongolia, in, early, 1225, genghis, spent, the, year, in, preparation, for, a, campaign, against, them, this, began, in, the, first, months, of, 1226, with, the, capture, of, khara, khoto, on, the, xia, s, western, border, the, invasion, proceeded, apace, genghis, ordered, that, the, cities, of, the, gansu, corridor, be, sacked, one, by, one, granting, clemency, only, to, a, few, having, crossed, the, yellow, river, in, autumn, the, mongols, besieged, present, day, lingwu, located, just, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, south, of, the, xia, capital, zhongxing, in, november, on, 4, december, genghis, decisively, defeated, a, xia, relief,

hunting, in, the, winter, of, 1226, 27, and, became, increasingly, ill, during, the, following, months, this, slowed, the, siege, of, zhongxing, s, progress, as, his, sons, and, commanders, urged, him, to, end, the, campaign, and, return, to, mongolia, to, recover, arguing, that, the, xia, would, still, be, there, another, year, incensed, by, insults, from, xia, s, leading, commander, genghis, insisted, that, the, siege, be, continued, he, died, on, either, 18, or, 25, august, 1227, but, his, death, was, kept, a, closely, guarded, secret, and, zhongxing, unaware, fell, the, following, month, the, city, was, put, to, the, sword, and, its, population, was, treated, with, extreme, savagery, the, xia, civilization, was, essentially, extinguished, in, what, man, described, as, a, very, successful, ethnocide, the, exact, nature, of, the, khan, s, death, has, been, the, subject, of, intense, speculation, rashid, al, din, and, the, history, of, yuan, mention, he, suffered, from, an, illness, possibly, malaria, typhus, or, bubonic, plague, marco, polo, claimed, that, he, was, shot, by, an, arrow, during, a, siege, while, carpini, reported, that, genghis, was, struck, by, lightning, legends, sprang, up, around, the, event, the, most, famous, recounts, how, the, beautiful, gurbelchin, formerly, the, xia, emperor, s, wife, injured, genghis, s, genitals, with, a, dagger, during, sex, after, his, death, genghis, was, transported, back, to, mongolia, and, buried, on, or, near, the, sacred, burkhan, khaldun, peak, in, the, khentii, mountains, on, a, site, he, had, chosen, years, before, specific, details, of, the, funeral, procession, and, burial, were, not, made, public, knowledge, the, mountain, declared, ikh, khorig, lit, great, taboo, i, e, prohibited,

thirty, maidens, ratchnevsky, theorised, that, the, mongols, who, had, no, knowledge, of, embalming, techniques, may, have, buried, the, khan, in, the, ordos, to, avoid, his, body, decomposing, in, the, summer, heat, while, en, route, to, mongolia, atwood, rejects, this, hypothesis, the, tribes, of, the, mongol, steppe, had, no, fixed, succession, system, but, often, defaulted, to, some, form, of, ultimogeniture, succession, of, the, youngest, son, because, he, would, have, had, the, least, time, to, gain, a, following, for, himself, and, needed, the, help, of, his, father, s, inheritance, however, this, type, of, inheritance, applied, only, to, property, not, to, titles, the, secret, history, records, that, genghis, chose, his, successor, while, preparing, for, the, khwarazmian, campaigns, in, 1219, rashid, al, din, on, the, other, hand, states, that, the, decision, came, before, genghis, s, final, campaign, against, the, xia, regardless, of, the, date, there, were, five, possible, candidates, genghis, s, four, sons, and, his, youngest, brother, tem, ge, who, had, the, weakest, claim, and, who, was, never, seriously, considered, even, though, there, was, a, strong, possibility, jochi, was, illegitimate, genghis, was, not, particularly, concerned, by, this, nevertheless, he, and, jochi, became, increasingly, estranged, over, time, due, to, jochi, s, preoccupation, with, his, own, appanage, after, the, siege, of, gurganj, where, he, only, reluctantly, participated, in, besieging, the, wealthy, city, that, would, become, part, of, his, territory, he, failed, to, give, genghis, the, normal, share, of, the, booty, which, exacerbated, the, tensions, genghis, was, angered, by, jochi, s, refusal, to, return, to, him, in, 1223, and, was, considering, sending, gedei, and, chagatai, to, bring, him, to, heel, when, news, came, that, jochi, had, died, from, an, illness, chagatai, s, attitude, towards, jochi, s, possible, succession, he, had, termed, his, elder, brother, a, merkit, bastard, and, had, brawled, with, him, in, front, of, their, father, led, genghis, to, view, him, as, uncompromising, arrogant, and, narrow, minded, despite, his, great, knowledge, of, mongol, legal, customs, his, elimination, left, gedei, and, tolui, as, the, two, primary, candidates, tolui, was, unquestionably, superior, in, military, terms, his, campaign, in, khorasan, had, broken, the, khwarazmian, empire, while, his, elder, brother, was, far, less, able, as, a, commander, gedei, was, also, known, to, drink, excessively, even, by, mongol, standards, it, eventually, caused, his, death, in, 1241, however, he, possessed, talents, all, his, brothers, lacked, he, was, generous, and, generally, well, liked, aware, of, his, own, lack, of, military, skill, he, was, able, to, trust, his, capable, subordinates, and, unlike, his, elder, brothers, compromise, on, issues, he, was, also, more, likely, to, preserve, mongol, traditions, than, tolui, whose, wife, sorghaghtani, herself, a, nestorian, christian, was, a, patron, of, many, religions, including, islam, gedei, was, thus, recognised, as, the, heir, to, the, mongol, throne, serving, as, regent, after, genghis, s, death, tolui, established, a, precedent, for, the, customary, traditions, after, a, khan, s, death, these, included, the, halting, of, all, military, offensives, involving, mongol, troops, the, establishment, of, a, lengthy, mourning, period, overseen, by, the, regent, and, the, holding, of, a, kurultai, which, would, nominate, successors, and, select, them, for, tolui, this, presented, an, opportunity, he, was, still, a, viable, candidate, for, succession, and, had, the, support, of, the, family, of, jochi, any, general, kurultai, attended, by, the, commanders, genghis, had, promoted, and, honoured, would, however, observe, their, former, ruler, s, desires, without, question, and, appoint, gedei, as, ruler, it, has, been, suggested, that, tolui, s, reluctance, to, hold, the, kurultai, was, driven, by, the, knowledge, of, the, threat, it, posed, to, his, ambitions, in, the, end, tolui, had, to, be, persuaded, by, the, advisor, yel, chucai, to, hold, the, kurultai, in, 1229, it, crowned, gedei, as, khan, with, tolui, in, attendance, b, rte, whom, tem, jin, married, c, 1178, remained, his, senior, wife, she, gave, birth, to,

eyes, and, lively, face, when, meeting, him, atwood, has, suggested, that, many, of, genghis, khan, s, values, especially, the, emphasis, he, placed, on, an, orderly, society, derive, from, his, turbulent, youth, he, valued, loyalty, above, all, and, mutual, fidelity, became, a, cornerstone, of, his, new, nation, genghis, did, not, find, it, difficult, to, gain, the, allegiance, of, others, he, was, superbly, charismatic, even, as, a, youth, as, shown, by, the, number, of, people, who, left, existing, social, roles, behind, to, join, him, although, his, trust, was, hard, to, earn, if, he, felt, loyalty, was, assured, he, granted, his, total, confidence, in, return, recognised, for, his, generosity, towards, his, followers, genghis, unhesitatingly, rewarded, previous, assistance,

across, legal, commercial, and, administrative, fields, he, also, understood, the, need, for, a, smooth, succession, and, modern, historians, agree, he, showed, good, judgement, in, choosing, his, heir, although, he, is, today, renowned, for, his, military, conquests, very, little, is, known, about, genghis, s, personal, generalship, his, skills, were, more, suited, to, identifying, potential, commanders, his, institution, of, a, meritocratic, command, structure, gave, the, mongol, army, military, superiority, even, though, it, was, not, technologically, or, tactically, innovative, the, army, that, genghis, created, was, characterised, by, its, draconian, discipline, its, ability, to, gather, and, use, military, intelligence, efficiently, a, mastery, of, psychological, warfare, and, a, willingness, to, be, utterly, ruthless, genghis, thoroughly, enjoyed, exacting, vengeance, on, his, enemies, the, concept, lay, at, the, heart, of, achi, qari, ulqu, lit, good, for, good, evil, for, evil, the, steppe, code, of, justice, in, exceptional, circumstances, such, as, when, muhammad, of, khwarazm, executed, his, envoys, the, need, for, vengeance, overrode, all, other, considerations, genghis, came, to, believe, the, supreme, deity, tengri, had, ordained, a, great, destiny, for, him, initially, the, bounds, of, this, ambition, were, limited, only, to, mongolia, but, as, success, followed, success, and, the, reach, of, the, mongol, nation, expanded, he, and, his, followers, came, to, believe, he, was, embodied, with, suu, lit, divine, grace, believing, that, he, had, an, intimate, connection, with, heaven, anyone, who, did, not, recognise, his, right, to, world, power, was, treated, as, an, enemy, this, viewpoint, allowed, genghis, to, rationalise, any, hypocritical, or, duplicitous, moments, on, his, own, part, such, as, killing, his, anda, jamukha, or, killing, n, kod, who, wavered, in, their, loyalties, genghis, khan, left, a, vast, and,

islamic, east, asian, civilizations, according, to, atwood, his, conquests, enabled, the, creation, of, eurasian, trading, systems, unprecedented, in, their, scale, which, brought, wealth, and, security, to, the, tribes, although, he, very, likely, did, not, codify, the, written, body, of, laws, known, as, the, great, yasa, he, did, reorganise, the, legal, system, and, establish, a, powerful, judicial, authority, under, shigi, qutuqu, on, the, other, hand, his, conquests, were, ruthless, and, brutal, the, prosperous, civilizations, of, china, central, asia, and, persia, were, devastated, by, the, mongol, assaults, and, underwent, multi, generational, trauma, and, suffering, as, a, result, perhaps, genghis, s, greatest, failing, was, his, inability, to, create, a, working, succession, system, his, division, of, his, empire, into, appanages, meant, to, ensure, stability, actually, did, the, reverse, as, local, and, state, wide, interests, diverged, and, the, empire, began, splitting, into, the, golden, horde, the, chagatai, khanate, the, ilkhanate, and, the, yuan, dynasty, in, the, late, 1200s, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, washington, post, acclaimed, genghis, khan, as, the, man, of, the, millennium, who, embodied, the, half, civilized, half, savage, duality, of, the, human, race, this, complex, image, has, remained, prevalent, in, modern, scholarship, with, historians, emphasising, both, genghis, khan, s, positive, and, negative, contributions, for, many, centuries, genghis, was, remembered, in, mongolia, as, a, religious, figure, not, a, political, one, after, altan, khan, converted, to, tibetan, buddhism, in, the, late, 1500s, genghis, was, deified, and, given, a, central, role, in, the, mongolian, religious, tradition, as, a, deity, genghis, drew, upon, buddhist, shamanistic, and, folk, traditions, for, example, he, was, defined, as, a, new, incarnation, of, a, chakravartin, idealised, ruler, like, ashoka, or, of, vajrapani, the, martial, bodhisattva, he, was, connected, genealogically, to, the, buddha, and, to, ancient, buddhist, kings, he, was, invoked, during, weddings, and, festivals, and, he, took, a, large, role, in, ancestor, veneration, rituals, he, also, became, the, focus, point, of, a, sleeping, hero, legend, which, says, he, will, return, to, help, the, mongol, people, in, a, time, of, great, need, his, cult, was, centred, at, the, naiman, chagan, ordon, lit, eight, white, yurts, today, a, mausoleum, in, inner, mongolia, china, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, genghis, began, to, be, viewed, as, the, national, hero, of, the, mongolian, people, foreign, powers, recognised, this, during, its, occupation, of, inner, mongolia, imperial, japan, funded, the, construction, of, a, temple, to, genghis, while, both, the, kuomintang, and, the, chinese, communist, party, used, the, memory, of, genghis, to, woo, potential, allies, in, the, chinese, civil, war, this, attitude, was, maintained, during, world, war, ii, when, the, soviet, aligned, mongolian, people, s, republic, promoted, genghis, to, build, patriotic, zeal, against, invaders, however, as, he, was, a, non, russian, hero, who, could, serve, as, an, anticommunist, figurehead, this, attitude, swiftly, changed, after, the, war, s, end, according, to, may, genghis, was, condemned, as, a, feudal, and, reactionary, lord, exploited, the, people, his, cult, was, repressed, the, alphabet, he, chose, was, replaced, with, the, cyrillic, script, and, celebrations, planned, for, the, 800th, anniversary, of, his, birth, in, 1962, were, cancelled, and, denigrated, after, loud, soviet, complaints, because, chinese, historians, were, largely, more, favourable, towards, him, than, their, soviet, circumstances, genghis, played, a, minor, role, in, the, sino, soviet, split, the, arrival, of, the, policies, of, glasnost, and, perestroika, in, the, 1980s, paved, the, way, for, official, rehabilitation, less, than, two, years, after, the, 1990, revolution, lenin, avenue, in, the, capital, ulaanbaatar, was, renamed, chinggis, khan, avenue, since, then, mongolia, has, named, chinggis, khaan, international, airport, and, erected, a, large, statue, in, s, khbaatar, square, which, was, itself, renamed, after, genghis, between, 2013, and, 2016, his, visage, appears, on, items, ranging, from, postage, stamps, and, high, value, banknotes, to, brands, of, alcohol, and, toilet, paper, in, 2006, the, mongolian, parliament, officially, discussed, the, trivialization, of, his, name, through, excessive, advertising, modern, mongolians, tend, to, downplay, genghis, s, military, conquests, in, favour, of, his, political, and, civil, legacy, they, view, the, destructive, campaigns, as, a, product, of, their, time, in, the, words, of, the, historian, michal, biran, and, secondary, to, his, other, contributions, to, mongolian, and, world, history, his, policies, such, his, use, of, the, kurultai, his, establishment, of, the, rule, of, law, through, an, independent, judiciary, and, human, rights, are, seen, as, the, foundations, that, allowed, the, creation, of, the, modern, democratic, mongolian, state, viewed, as, someone, who, brought, peace, and, knowledge, rather, than, war, and, destruction, genghis, khan, is, idealised, for, making, mongolia, the, centre, of, international, culture, for, a, period, he, is, generally, recognised, as, the, founding, father, of, mongolia, the, historical, and, modern, muslim, world, has, associated, genghis, khan, with, a, myriad, of, ideologies, and, beliefs, its, first, instinct, as, islamic, thought, had, never, previously, envisioned, being, ruled, by, a, non, muslim, power, was, to, view, genghis, as, the, herald, of, the, approaching, judgement, day, over, time, as, the, world, failed, to, end, and, as, his, descendants, began, converting, to, islam, muslims, began, to, see, genghis, as, an, instrument, of, god, s, will, who, was, destined, to, strengthen, the, muslim, world, by, cleansing, its, innate, corruption, in, post, mongol, asia, genghis, was, also, a, source, of, political, legitimacy, because, his, descendants, had, been, recognised, as, the, only, ones, entitled, to, reign, as, a, result, aspiring, potentates, not, descended, from, him, had, to, justify, their, rule, either, by, nominating, puppet, rulers, of, genghis, s, dynasty, or, by, stressing, their, own, connections, to, him, most, notably, the, great, conqueror, timur, who, established, his, own, empire, in, central, asia, did, both, he, was, obliged, to, pay, homage, to, genghis, s, descendants, soyurgatmish, and, sultan, mahmud, and, his, propaganda, campaigns, vastly, exaggerated, the, prominence, of, his, ancestor, qarachar, noyan, one, of, genghis, s, lesser, commanders, depicting, him, as, genghis, s, blood, relative, and, second, in, command, he, also, married, at, least, two, of, genghis, s, descendants, babur, the, founder, of, the, mughal, empire, in, india, in, turn, derived, his, authority, through, his, descent, from, both, timur, and, genghis, until, the, eighteenth, century, in, central, asia, genghis, was, considered, the, progenitor, of, the, social, order, and, was, second, only, to, the, prophet, muhammad, in, legal, authority, with, the, rise, of, arab, nationalism, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, arab, world, began, to, view, genghis, increasingly, negatively, today, he, is, perceived, as, the, ultimate, accursed, enemy, a, barbarian, savage, who, began, the, demolition, of, civilization, which, culminated, in, by, his, grandson, hulegu, similarly, genghis, is, viewed, extremely, negatively, in, russia, where, historians, have, consistently, portrayed, the, rule, of, the, golden, horde, the, tatar, yoke, as, backwards, destructive, inimical, to, all, progress, and, the, reason, for, all, of, russia, s, flaws, his, treatment, in, modern, central, asia, and, turkey, is, more, ambivalent, his, position, as, a, non, muslim, means, other, national, traditions, and, heroes, such, as, timur, and, the, seljuks, are, viewed, more, highly, under, the, yuan, dynasty, in, china, genghis, was, revered, as, the, nation, s, creator, and, he, remained, in, this, position, even, after, the, foundation, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1368, although, the, late, ming, somewhat, disavowed, his, memory, the, positive, viewpoint, was, restored, under, the, manchu, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1911, who, positioned, themselves, as, his, heirs, the, rise, of, 20th, century, chinese, nationalism, initially, caused, the, denigration, of, genghis, as, a, traumatic, occupier, but, he, was, later, resurrected, as, a, useful, political, symbol, on, a, variety, of, issues, modern, chinese, historiography, has, generally, viewed, genghis, positively, and, he, has, been, portrayed, as, a, chinese, hero, in, contemporary, japan, he, is, most, known, for, the, legend, that, he, was, originally, minamoto, no, yoshitsune, a, samurai, and, tragic, hero, who, was, forced, to, commit, seppuku, in, 1189, the, western, world, never, directly, affected, by, genghis, has, viewed, him, in, shifting, and, contrasting, ways, during, the, 14th, century, as, shown, by, the, works, of, marco, polo, and, geoffrey, chaucer, he, was, seen, as, a, just, and, wise, ruler, but, during, the, eighteenth, century, he, came, to, embody, the, enlightenment, stereotype, of, a, tyrannical, oriental, despot, and, by, the, twentieth, century, he, represented, a, prototypical, barbarian, warlord, in, recent, decades, western, scholarship, has, become, increasingly, nuanced, viewing, genghis, as, a, more, complex, individual
