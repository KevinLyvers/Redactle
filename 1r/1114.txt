prithviraja, iii, iast, p, thv, r, ja, reign, 22, may, 1166, december, 1192, popularly, known, as, prithviraj, chauhan, or, rai, pithora, was, a, king, from, the, chauhan, chahamana, dynasty, who, ruled, the, territory, of, sapadalaksha, with, his, capital, at, ajmer, in, present, day, rajasthan, in, north, western, india, ascending, the, throne, as, a, minor, in, 1177, ce, prithviraj, inherited, a, kingdom, which, stretched, from, thanesar, in, the, north, to, jahazpur, mewar, in, the, south, which, he, aimed, to, expand, by, military, actions, against, neighbouring, kingdoms, most, notably, defeating, the, chandelas, prithviraj, led, a, coalition, of, several, rajput, kings, and, defeated, the, ghurid, army, led, by, muhammad, of, ghor, near, taraori, in, 1191, however, in, 1192, muhammad, returned, with, an, army, of, turkish, mounted, archers, and, defeated, the, rajput, army, on, the, same, battlefield, prithviraj, was, captured, and, summarliy, executed, although, his, minor, son, govindaraja, was, reinstated, by, muhammad, as, his, puppet, ruler, in, ajmer, his, defeat, at, tarain, is, seen, as, a, landmark, event, in, the, islamic, conquest, of, india, and, has, been, described, in, several, semi, legendary, accounts, most, notably, the, prithviraj, raso, the, extant, inscriptions, from, prithviraj, s, reign, are, few, in, number, and, were, not, issued, by, the, king, himself, much, of, the, information, about, him, comes, from, the, medieval, legendary, chronicles, besides, the, muslim, accounts, of, battles, of, tarain, he, has, been, mentioned, in, several, medieval, kavyas, epic, poems, by, hindu, and, jain, authors, these, include, prithviraja, vijaya, hammira, mahakavya, and, prithviraj, raso, these, texts, contain, eulogistic, descriptions, and, are, therefore, not, entirely, reliable, prithviraja, vijaya, is, the, only, surviving, literary, text, from, the, reign, of, prithviraj, prithviraj, raso, which, popularized, prithviraj, as, a, great, king, is, purported, to, be, written, by, his, court, poet, chand, bardai, however, it, contains, many, exaggerated, accounts, much, of, which, is, not, useful, for, the, purposes, of, history, other, chronicles, and, texts, that, mention, prithviraj, include, prabandha, chintamani, prabandha, kosha, and, prithviraja, prabandha, these, were, composed, centuries, after, his, death, and, contain, exaggerations, and, anachronistic, anecdotes, prithviraj, has, also, been, mentioned, in, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, a, sanskrit, text, containing, biographies, of, the, kharatara, jain, monks, while, the, work, was, completed, in, 1336, ce, the, part, that, mentions, prithviraj, was, written, around, 1250, ce, the, alha, khanda, or, alha, raso, of, the, chandela, poet, jaganika, also, provides, an, exaggerated, account, of, prithviraj, s, war, against, the, chandelas, some, other, indian, texts, also, mention, prithviraj, but, do, not, provide, much, information, of, historical, value, for, example, the, sanskrit, poem, anthology, sharngadhara, paddhati, 1363, contains, a, verse, praising, him, and, the, kanhadade, prabandha, 1455, mentions, him, as, an, earlier, incarnation, of, the, jalore, chahamana, king, viramade, prithviraj, was, born, to, the, chahamana, king, someshvara, and, queen, karpuradevi, a, kalachuri, princess, both, prithviraj, and, his, younger, brother, hariraja, were, born, in, gujarat, where, their, father, someshvara, was, brought, up, at, the, chaulukya, court, by, his, maternal, relatives, according, to, prithviraja, vijaya, prithviraj, was, born, on, the, 12th, day, of, the, jyeshtha, month, the, text, does, not, mention, the, year, of, his, birth, but, provides, some, of, the, astrological, planetary, positions, at, the, time, of, his, birth, calling, them, auspicious, based, on, these, positions, and, assuming, certain, other, planetary, positions, dasharatha, sharma, calculated, the, year, of, prithviraj, s, birth, as, 1166, ce, 1223, vs, the, medieval, biographies, of, prithviraj, suggest, that, he, was, educated, well, the, prithviraja, vijaya, states, that, he, mastered, 6, languages, the, prithviraj, raso, claims, that, he, learned, 14, languages, which, appears, to, be, an, exaggeration, the, raso, goes, on, to, claim, that, he, became, well, versed, in, a, number, of, subjects, including, history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy, mimamsa, and, theology, both, the, texts, state, that, he, was, particularly, proficient, in, archery, prithviraj, moved, from, gujarat, to, ajmer, when, his, father, someshvara, was, crowned, the, chahamana, king, after, the, death, of, prithviraja, ii, someshvara, died, in, 1177, ce, 1234, vs, when, prithviraj, was, around, 11, years, old, the, last, inscription, from, someshvara, s, reign, and, the, first, inscription, from, prithviraj, s, reign, are, both, dated, to, this, year, prithviraj, who, was, a, minor, at, the, time, ascended, the, throne, with, his, mother, as, the, regent, the, hammira, mahakavya, claims, that, someshvara, himself, installed, prithviraj, on, the, throne, and, then, retired, to, the, forest, however, this, is, doubtful, during, his, early, years, as, the, king, prithviraj, s, mother, managed, the, administration, assisted, by, a, regency, council, kadambavasa, served, as, the, chief, minister, of, the, kingdom, during, this, period, he, is, also, known, as, kaimasa, kaimash, or, kaimbasa, in, the, folk, legends, which, describe, him, as, an, able, administrator, and, soldier, devoted, to, the, young, king, prithviraja, vijaya, states, that, he, was, responsible, for, all, the, military, victories, during, the, early, years, of, prithviraj, s, reign, according, to, two, different, legends, kadambavasa, was, later, killed, by, prithviraj, the, prithviraja, raso, claims, that, prithviraj, killed, the, minister, after, finding, him, in, the, apartment, of, the, king, s, favourite, concubine, karnati, prithviraja, prabandha, claims, that, a, man, named, pratapa, simha, conspired, against, the, minister, and, convinced, prithviraj, that, the, minister, was, responsible, for, the, repeated, muslim, invasions, both, these, claims, appear, to, be, historically, inaccurate, as, the, much, more, historically, reliable, prithviraja, vijaya, does, not, mention, any, such, incident, bhuvanaikamalla, the, paternal, uncle, of, prithviraj, s, mother, was, another, important, minister, during, this, time, according, to, prithviraja, vijaya, he, was, a, valiant, general, who, served, prithviraj, as, garuda, serves, vishnu, the, text, also, states, that, he, was, proficient, in, the, art, of, subduing, n, ga, s, according, to, the, 15th, century, historian, jonaraja, naga, here, refers, to, elephants, however, har, bilas, sarda, interpreted, naga, as, the, name, of, a, tribe, and, theorized, that, bhuvanaikamalla, defeated, this, tribe, according, to, historian, dasharatha, sharma, prithviraj, assumed, actual, control, of, the, administration, in, 1180, ce, 1237, vs, the, first, military, achievement, of, prithviraj, was, his, suppression, of, a, revolt, by, his, cousin, nagarjuna, and, recapture, of, gudapura, iast, gu, apura, possibly, modern, gurgaon, nagarjuna, was, a, son, of, prithviraj, s, uncle, vigraharaja, iv, and, the, struggle, for, the, chahamana, throne, had, led, to, a, rivalry, between, the, two, branches, of, the, family, according, to, prithviraja, vijaya, nagarjuna, rebelled, against, prithviraj, s, authority, and, occupied, the, fort, of, gudapura, prithviraj, besieged, gudapura, with, a, large, army, comprising, infantry, camels, elephants, and, horses, nagarjuna, fled, the, fort, but, devabhata, possibly, his, general, continued, to, offer, resistance, ultimately, prithviraj, s, army, emerged, victorious, and, captured, the, wife, mother, and, followers, of, nagarjuna, according, to, prithviraja, vijaya, a, garland, made, of, the, defeated, soldiers, heads, was, hung, across, the, ajmer, fort, gate, two, verses, of, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, mention, the, victory, of, prithviraj, over, the, bhadanakas, while, describing, a, debate, between, two, jain, monks, this, victory, can, be, dated, to, sometime, before, 1182, ce, when, the, said, debate, took, place, according, to, cynthia, talbot, the, bhadanakas, were, an, obscure, dynasty, who, controlled, the, area, around, bayana, according, to, dasharatha, sharma, the, bhadanaka, territory, comprised, the, area, around, present, day, bhiwani, rewari, and, alwar, the, 1182, 83, ce, 1239, vs, madanpur, inscriptions, from, prithviraj, s, reign, claim, that, he, laid, to, waste, jejakabhukti, present, day, bundelkhand, which, was, ruled, by, the, chandela, king, paramardi, prithviraj, s, invasion, of, the, chandela, territory, is, also, described, in, the, later, folk, legends, such, as, prithviraj, raso, paramal, raso, and, alha, raso, other, texts, such, as, sarangadhara, paddhati, and, prabandha, chintamani, also, mention, prithviraj, s, attack, on, paramardi, the, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, mentions, that, prithviraj, had, embarked, upon, a, digvijaya, conquest, of, all, the, regions, this, appears, to, be, a, reference, to, the, start, of, prithviraj, s, march, to, jejakabhukti, the, legendary, account, of, prithviraj, s, campaign, against, the, chandelas, goes, like, this, prithviraj, was, returning, to, delhi, after, marrying, the, daughter, of, padamsen, when, his, contingent, was, attacked, by, the, turkic, forces, ghurids, his, army, repulsed, the, attacks, but, suffered, serious, casualties, in, the, process, amid, this, chaos, the, chahamana, soldiers, lost, their, way, and, unknowingly, encamped, in, the, chandela, capital, mahoba, they, killed, the, chandela, royal, gardener, for, objecting, to, their, presence, which, led, to, a, skirmish, between, the, two, sides, the, chandela, king, paramardi, asked, his, general, udal, to, attack, prithviraj, s, camp, but, udal, advised, against, this, move, paramardi, s, brother, in, law, mahil, parihar, ruled, modern, day, orai, he, harboured, ill, will, against, paramardi, and, instigated, the, king, to, go, ahead, with, the, attack, prithviraj, defeated, udal, s, contingent, and, then, left, for, delhi, subsequently, unhappy, with, mahil, s, scheming, udal, and, his, brother, alha, left, the, chandela, court, they, started, serving, jaichand, the, gahadavala, ruler, of, kannauj, mahil, then, secretly, informed, prithviraj, that, chandela, kingdom, had, become, weak, in, absence, of, its, strongest, generals, prithviraj, invaded, the, chandela, kingdom, and, besieged, sirsagarh, which, was, held, by, udal, s, cousin, malkhan, after, failing, to, win, over, malkhan, through, peaceful, methods, and, losing, eight, generals, prithviraj, captured, the, fort, the, chandelas, then, appealed, for, a, truce, and, used, this, time, to, recall, alha, and, udal, from, kannauj, in, support, of, the, chandelas, jaichand, dispatched, an, army, led, by, his, best, generals, including, two, of, his, own, sons, the, combined, chandela, gahadavala, army, attacked, prithviraj, s, camp, but, was, defeated, after, his, victory, prithviraj, sacked, mahoba, he, then, dispatched, his, general, chavand, rai, to, kalinjar, fort, to, capture, paramardi, according, to, the, various, legends, paramardi, either, died, or, retired, shortly, after, the, attack, prithviraj, returned, to, delhi, after, appointing, pajjun, rai, as, the, governor, of, mahoba, later, paramardi, s, son, recaptured, mahoba, the, exact, historicity, of, this, legendary, narrative, is, debatable, the, madanpur, inscriptions, establish, that, prithviraj, sacked, mahoba, but, historical, evidence, suggests, that, his, occupation, of, chandela, territory, is, either, a, fabrication, by, the, bards, or, did, not, last, long, it, is, known, that, paramardi, did, not, die, or, retire, immediately, after, the, chauhan, victory, in, fact, he, continued, ruling, as, a, sovereign, nearly, a, decade, after, prithviraj, s, death, cynthia, talbot, asserts, that, prithviraj, only, raided, jejakabhukti, and, paramardi, regained, control, of, his, kingdom, soon, after, his, departure, from, mahoba, talbot, continues, that, prithviraj, was, not, able, to, annex, the, chandela, territory, to, his, kingdom, conversely, according, to, r, b, singh, it, is, probable, that, some, part, of, chandela, territory, was, annexed, by, chahmanas, albeit, for, a, short, time, the, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, mentions, a, peace, treaty, between, prithviraj, and, bhima, ii, the, chaulukya, solanki, king, of, gujarat, this, implies, that, the, two, kings, were, previously, at, war, this, war, can, be, dated, to, sometime, before, 1187, ce, 1244, vs, the, veraval, inscription, states, that, bhima, s, prime, minister, jagaddeva, pratihara, was, the, moon, to, the, lotus, like, queens, of, prithviraja, a, reference, to, the, belief, that, the, moon, rise, causes, a, day, blooming, lotus, to, close, its, petals, since, bhima, was, a, minor, at, the, time, it, appears, that, jagaddeva, led, the, campaign, on, the, chaulukya, side, the, historically, unreliable, prithviraj, raso, provides, some, details, about, the, chahamana, chaulukya, struggle, according, to, it, both, prithviraj, and, bhima, wanted, to, marry, ichchhini, the, paramara, princess, of, abu, prithviraj, s, marriage, to, her, led, to, a, rivalry, between, the, two, kings, historian, g, h, ojha, dismisses, this, legend, as, fiction, because, it, states, that, ichchhini, was, a, daughter, of, salakha, while, dharavarsha, was, the, paramara, ruler, of, abu, at, the, time, historian, r, b, singh, on, the, other, hand, believes, that, salakha, was, the, head, of, another, paramara, branch, at, abu, the, raso, also, mentions, that, prithviraj, s, uncle, kanhadeva, had, killed, seven, sons, of, bhima, s, uncle, sarangadeva, to, avenge, these, murders, bhima, invaded, the, chahamana, kingdom, and, killed, prithviraj, s, father, someshvara, capturing, nagor, in, the, process, prithviraj, re, captured, nagor, and, defeated, and, killed, bhima, this, is, known, to, be, historically, false, as, the, reign, of, bhima, ii, lasted, nearly, half, a, century, after, prithviraj, s, death, similarly, historical, evidence, suggests, bhima, ii, was, a, child, at, the, time, of, someshvara, s, death, and, therefore, could, not, have, killed, him, despite, these, discrepancies, there, is, some, evidence, of, a, battle, between, the, chahamanas, and, the, chaulukyas, at, nagor, two, inscriptions, found, at, charlu, village, near, bikaner, commemorate, the, death, of, mohil, soldiers, at, the, battle, of, nagor, in, 1184, ce, 1241, vs, the, mohils, are, a, branch, of, the, chauhans, the, chahamanas, and, it, is, possible, the, inscriptions, refer, to, the, battle, described, in, prithviraj, raso, sometime, before, 1187, ce, jagaddeva, pratihara, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, prithviraj, according, to, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, a, chief, named, abhayada, once, sought, jagaddeva, s, permission, to, attack, and, rob, the, wealthy, visitors, from, sapadalaksha, country, the, chahamana, territory, in, response, jagaddeva, told, abhayada, that, he, had, concluded, a, treaty, with, prithviraj, with, much, difficulty, jaggadeva, then, threatened, to, have, abhayada, sewn, in, a, donkey, s, belly, if, he, harassed, the, people, of, sapadalaksha, historian, dasharatha, sharma, theorizes, that, the, chahamana, chaulukya, conflict, ended, with, some, advantage, for, prithviraj, as, jagaddeva, appears, to, have, been, very, anxious, to, preserve, the, treaty, according, to, historian, r, c, majumdar, and, satish, chandra, his, long, drawn, out, struggle, against, gujarat, was, unsuccessful, and, he, suffered, a, reverse, against, bhima, thus, prithviraj, concluded, a, treaty, by, 1187, ce, the, area, around, mount, abu, was, ruled, by, the, chandravati, paramara, ruler, dharavarsha, who, was, a, chaulukya, feudatory, partha, parakrama, vyayoga, a, text, written, by, his, younger, brother, prahaladana, describes, prithviraj, s, night, attack, on, abu, this, attack, according, to, the, text, was, a, failure, for, the, chahamanas, it, probably, happened, during, the, gujarat, campaign, of, prithviraj, the, gahadavala, kingdom, centered, around, kannauj, and, headed, by, another, powerful, king, jayachandra, was, located, to, the, east, of, the, chahamana, kingdom, according, to, a, legend, mentioned, in, prithviraj, raso, prithviraj, eloped, with, jayachandra, s, daughter, samyogita, leading, to, a, rivalry, between, the, two, kings, the, legend, goes, like, this, king, jaichand, jayachandra, of, kannauj, decided, to, conduct, a, rajasuya, ceremony, to, proclaim, his, supremacy, prithviraj, refused, to, participate, in, this, ceremony, and, thus, refused, to, acknowledge, jaichand, as, the, supreme, king, jaichand, s, daughter, samyogita, fell, in, love, with, prithviraj, after, hearing, about, his, heroic, exploits, and, declared, that, she, would, marry, only, him, jaichand, arranged, a, swayamvara, husband, selection, ceremony, for, his, daughter, but, did, not, invite, prithviraj, nevertheless, prithviraj, marched, to, kannauj, with, a, hundred, warriors, and, eloped, with, samyogita, two, thirds, of, his, warriors, sacrificed, their, life, in, fight, against, the, gahadavala, army, allowing, him, to, escape, to, delhi, with, samyogita, in, delhi, prithviraj, became, infatuated, with, his, new, wife, and, started, spending, most, of, his, time, with, her, he, started, ignoring, the, state, affairs, which, ultimately, led, to, his, defeat, against, muhammad, of, ghor, this, legend, is, also, mentioned, in, abu, l, fazl, s, ain, i, akbari, and, chandrashekhara, s, surjana, charita, which, names, the, gahadavala, princess, as, kantimati, prithviraja, vijaya, mentions, that, prithviraj, fell, in, love, with, the, incarnation, of, an, apsara, tilottama, although, he, had, never, seen, this, woman, and, was, already, married, to, other, women, according, to, historian, dasharatha, sharma, this, is, probably, a, reference, to, samyogita, however, this, legend, is, not, mentioned, in, other, historical, sources, such, as, prithviraja, prabandha, prabandha, chintamani, prabandha, kosha, and, hammira, mahakavya, the, gahadavala, records, are, also, silent, about, this, event, including, the, supposed, rajasuya, performance, by, jayachandra, according, to, dasharatha, sharma, and, r, b, singh, there, might, be, some, historical, truth, in, this, legend, as, it, is, mentioned, in, three, different, sources, all, three, sources, place, the, event, sometime, before, prithviraj, s, final, confrontation, with, muhammad, of, ghor, in, 1192, ce, the, prithviraj, raso, mentions, that, prithviraj, defeated, nahar, rai, of, mandovara, and, the, mughal, chief, mudgala, rai, but, these, stories, appear, to, be, pure, fiction, no, historical, records, suggest, existence, of, these, persons, the, construction, of, the, now, ruined, qila, rai, pithora, fort, in, delhi, is, attributed, to, prithviraj, according, to, prithviraj, raso, delhi, s, ruler, anangpal, tomar, gave, the, city, to, his, son, in, law, prithviraj, and, was, defeated, when, he, wanted, it, back, this, is, historically, inaccurate, as, delhi, was, annexed, to, the, chahamana, territory, by, prithviraj, s, uncle, vigraharaja, iv, in, addition, historical, evidence, suggests, that, anangpal, tomar, died, before, the, birth, of, prithviraj, the, claim, about, his, daughter, s, marriage, to, prithviraj, appears, to, have, been, concocted, at, a, later, date, prithviraj, s, predecessors, had, faced, multiple, raids, from, the, muslim, dynasties, that, had, captured, the, north, western, areas, of, the, indian, subcontinent, by, the, 12th, century, by, the, late, 12th, century, the, ghazna, based, ghurid, dynasty, controlled, the, territory, to, the, west, of, the, chahamana, kingdom, while, prithviraj, was, still, a, child, in, 1175, ce, the, ghurid, ruler, muhammad, of, ghor, crossed, the, indus, river, and, captured, multan, in, 1178, ce, he, invaded, gujarat, which, was, ruled, by, the, chaulukyas, solankis, during, its, march, to, gujarat, the, ghurid, army, appears, to, have, passed, through, the, western, frontier, of, the, chahamana, kingdom, as, evident, by, the, destruction, of, several, temples, and, sacking, of, the, bhati, ruled, lodhruva, the, prithviraja, vijaya, mentions, that, the, activities, of, the, ghurid, army, were, like, rahu, to, the, chahamana, kingdom, in, hindu, mythology, rahu, swallows, the, sun, causing, a, solar, eclipse, however, it, does, not, mention, any, military, engagement, between, the, two, kingdoms, on, its, way, to, gujarat, the, ghurid, army, besieged, the, naddula, nadol, fort, which, was, controlled, by, the, chahamanas, of, naddula, prithviraj, s, chief, minister, kadambavasa, advised, him, not, to, offer, any, assistance, to, the, rivals, of, the, ghurids, and, to, stay, away, from, this, conflict, the, chahamanas, did, not, immediately, face, a, ghurid, invasion, because, the, chaulukyas, of, gujarat, defeated, muhammad, at, the, battle, of, kasahrada, in, 1178, ce, forcing, the, ghurids, to, retreat, over, the, next, few, years, muhammad, of, ghor, consolidated, his, power, in, the, territory, to, the, west, of, the, chahamanas, conquering, peshawar, sindh, and, punjab, he, shifted, his, base, from, ghazna, to, punjab, and, made, attempts, to, expand, his, empire, eastwards, which, brought, him, into, conflict, with, prithviraj, prithviraja, vijaya, mentions, that, muhammad, of, ghor, sent, an, ambassador, to, prithviraj, but, does, not, provide, any, details, hasan, nizami, s, taj, ul, maasir, 13th, century, ce, states, that, muhammad, sent, his, chief, judge, qiwam, ul, mulk, ruknud, din, hamza, to, prithviraj, s, court, the, envoy, tried, to, convince, prithviraj, to, abandon, belligerence, and, pursue, the, path, of, rectitude, but, was, unsuccessful, as, a, result, muhammad, decided, to, wage, a, war, against, prithviraj, the, medieval, muslim, writers, mention, only, one, or, two, battles, between, the, two, rulers, the, tabaqat, i, nasiri, and, tarikh, i, firishta, mention, the, two, battles, of, tarain, jami, ul, hikaya, and, taj, ul, maasir, mention, only, the, second, battle, of, tarain, in, which, prithviraj, was, defeated, however, the, hindu, and, jain, writers, state, that, prithviraj, defeated, muhammad, multiple, times, before, being, killed, while, these, accounts, seem, to, exaggerate, the, number, it, is, possible, that, more, than, two, engagements, took, place, between, the, ghurids, and, the, chahamanas, during, prithviraj, s, reign, the, early, victories, mentioned, by, the, hindu, and, jain, writers, probably, refer, to, prithviraj, s, successful, repulsion, of, raids, by, ghurid, generals, during, 1190, 1191, ce, muhammad, of, ghor, invaded, the, chahamana, territory, and, captured, tabarhindah, or, tabar, e, hind, identified, with, bathinda, he, placed, it, under, the, charge, of, zia, ud, din, the, qazi, of, tulak, supported, by, 1200, horsemen, when, prithviraj, learned, about, this, marched, towards, tabarhindah, with, his, feudatories, including, govindaraja, of, delhi, according, to, the, 16th, century, muslim, historian, firishta, his, force, comprised, 200, 000, horses, and, 3, 000, elephants, muhammad, s, original, plan, was, to, return, to, his, base, after, conquering, tabarhindah, but, when, he, heard, about, prithviraj, s, march, he, decided, to, put, up, a, fight, he, set, out, with, an, army, and, encountered, prithviraj, s, forces, at, tarain, in, the, ensuing, battle, prithviraj, s, army, decisively, defeated, the, ghurids, muhammad, of, ghor, was, injured, and, forced, to, retreat, prithviraj, did, not, pursue, the, retreating, ghurid, army, not, wanting, to, invade, hostile, territory, or, misjudge, ghori, s, ambition, he, only, besieged, the, ghurid, garrison, at, tabarhindah, which, surrendered, after, 13, months, of, siege, prithviraj, seems, to, have, treated, the, first, battle, of, tarain, as, merely, a, frontier, fight, this, view, is, strengthened, by, the, fact, that, he, made, little, preparations, for, any, future, clash, with, muhammad, of, ghor, according, to, prithviraj, raso, during, the, period, preceding, his, final, confrontation, with, the, ghurids, he, neglected, the, affairs, of, the, state, and, spent, time, in, merry, making, meanwhile, muhammad, of, ghor, returned, to, ghazna, and, made, preparations, to, avenge, his, defeat, according, to, tabaqat, i, nasiri, he, gathered, a, well, equipped, army, of, 120, 000, select, afghan, tajik, and, turkic, horsemen, over, the, next, few, months, he, then, marched, towards, the, chahamana, kingdom, via, multan, and, lahore, aided, by, vijayaraja, of, jammu, prithviraj, had, been, left, without, any, allies, as, a, result, of, his, wars, against, the, neighbouring, hindu, kings, nevertheless, he, managed, to, gather, a, large, army, to, counter, the, ghurids, prithviraj, successfully, marshaled, a, sizeable, army, composed, of, over, 100, rajput, rulers, mainly, war, elephants, cavalrymen, and, foot, soldiers, the, 16th, century, muslim, historian, firishta, estimated, the, strength, of, prithviraj, s, army, as, 300, 000, horses, and, 3, 000, elephants, in, addition, to, a, large, infantry, this, is, most, likely, a, gross, exaggeration, aimed, at, emphasizing, the, scale, of, the, ghurid, victory, prithviraj, wrote, a, letter, to, muhammad, of, ghor, promising, him, no, harm, if, he, decided, to, return, to, his, own, country, muhammad, insisted, that, he, needed, time, to, confer, his, brother, ghiyath, al, din, who, was, ruling, from, his, capital, at, firozkoh, according, to, firishta, he, agreed, to, a, truce, until, he, received, an, answer, from, his, brother, however, he, planned, an, attack, against, the, chahamanas, according, to, jawami, ul, hikayat, muhammad, assigned, a, few, men, to, keep, the, fires, in, his, camp, burning, at, night, while, he, marched, off, in, another, direction, with, the, rest, of, his, army, this, gave, the, chahamanas, an, impression, that, the, ghurid, army, was, still, encamped, observing, the, truce, after, reaching, several, miles, away, muhammad, formed, four, divisions, with, 10, 000, archers, each, he, kept, the, rest, of, his, army, in, reserve, he, ordered, the, four, divisions, to, launch, an, attack, on, the, chahamana, camp, and, then, pretend, a, retreat, at, dawn, the, four, divisions, of, the, ghurid, army, attacked, the, chahamana, camp, while, prithviraj, was, still, asleep, after, a, brief, fight, the, ghurid, divisions, pretended, to, retreat, in, accordance, with, muhammad, s, strategy, prithviraj, was, thus, lured, into, chasing, them, and, by, the, afternoon, the, chahamana, army, was, exhausted, as, a, result, of, this, pursuit, at, this, point, muhammad, led, his, reserve, force, of, 10, 000, mounted, archers, and, attacked, the, chahamanas, decisively, defeating, them, chronicler, juzjani, attributed, the, success, of, the, ghurid, army, to, the, 10, 000, mounted, archers, which, eventually, overthrow, the, infidel, host, however, scholars, like, dashratha, sharma, and, r, b, singh, argue, that, ghoris, triumph, was, more, a, result, of, deceitful, and, treacherous, strategies, rather, than, the, inherent, strength, of, his, forces, according, to, taj, ul, maasir, prithviraj, s, camp, lost, 100, 000, men, including, govindaraja, of, delhi, in, this, debacle, prithviraj, himself, tried, to, escape, on, a, horse, but, was, pursued, and, caught, near, the, sarasvati, fort, possibly, modern, sirsa, subsequently, muhammad, of, ghor, captured, ajmer, after, killing, several, thousand, defenders, enslaved, many, more, and, destroyed, the, city, s, temples, prabandha, chintamani, by, the, 14th, century, jain, scholar, merutunga, states, that, prithviraj, cut, off, the, ears, of, one, of, his, ministers, who, guided, the, ghurid, invaders, to, his, camp, as, revenge, prithviraj, was, in, deep, sleep, after, a, day, of, religious, fasting, and, therefore, was, easily, captured, hammira, mahakavya, by, the, 15th, century, jain, scholar, nayachandra, suri, states, that, after, his, initial, defeat, the, ghurid, king, raised, a, fresh, army, with, the, support, of, a, neighboring, king, and, marched, to, delhi, before, the, battle, he, bribed, prithviraj, s, master, of, horses, and, musicians, with, gold, coins, the, master, of, horses, had, trained, prithviraj, s, horse, to, prance, to, drumbeats, the, ghurids, attacked, the, chahamana, camp, just, before, dawn, when, prithviraj, was, sleeping, prithviraj, tried, to, escape, on, his, horse, but, his, musicians, sounded, the, drums, the, horse, started, prancing, and, the, invaders, easily, captured, prithviraj, according, to, another, jain, text, prithviraja, prabandha, prithviraj, s, minister, kaimbasa, and, his, spear, bearer, pratapasimha, were, not, on, good, terms, kaimbasa, once, complained, to, king, against, pratapasimha, who, convinced, the, king, that, kaimbasa, was, aiding, the, ghurids, an, angry, prithviraj, attempted, to, kill, kaimbasa, with, an, arrow, one, night, but, ended, up, killing, another, man, when, his, bard, chand, baliddika, admonished, him, the, king, dismissed, both, the, bard, and, the, minister, at, the, time, of, ghurid, invasion, of, delhi, prithviraj, had, been, sleeping, for, ten, days, when, the, ghurids, came, close, his, sister, woke, him, up, prithviraj, tried, to, flee, on, a, horse, but, kaimbasa, helped, the, ghurids, capture, him, by, telling, them, about, a, certain, sound, that, caused, his, horse, to, prance, most, medieval, sources, state, that, prithviraj, was, taken, to, the, chahamana, capital, ajmer, where, muhammad, planned, to, reinstate, him, as, a, ghurid, vassal, sometime, later, prithviraj, rebelled, against, muhammad, and, was, killed, for, treason, this, is, corroborated, by, numismatic, evidence, some, horse, and, bullman, style, coins, bearing, names, of, both, prithviraj, and, muhammad, bin, sam, were, issued, from, the, delhi, mint, although, another, possibility, is, that, the, ghurids, initially, used, chahamana, style, coinage, to, ensure, greater, acceptance, of, their, own, coinage, in, the, former, chahamana, territory, after, prithviraj, s, death, muhammad, installed, the, chahamana, prince, govindaraja, on, the, throne, of, ajmer, which, further, supports, this, theory, the, various, sources, differ, on, the, exact, circumstances, the, 13th, century, persian, historian, minhaj, i, siraj, states, that, prithviraj, was, sent, to, hell, after, being, captured, the, 16th, century, historian, firishta, also, supports, this, account, according, to, historian, satish, chandra, minhaj, s, account, suggests, that, prithviraj, was, executed, immediately, after, his, defeat, but, r, b, singh, believes, that, no, such, conclusion, can, be, drawn, from, minhaj, s, writings, viruddha, vidhi, vidhvansa, by, the, hindu, writer, lakshmidhara, is, the, only, source, that, claims, that, prithviraj, was, killed, on, the, battlefield, the, prithviraj, raso, claims, that, prithviraj, was, taken, to, ghazna, as, a, prisoner, and, blinded, on, hearing, this, the, poet, chand, bardai, traveled, to, ghazna, and, tricked, muhammad, of, ghor, into, watching, an, archery, performance, by, the, blind, prithviraj, during, this, performance, prithviraj, shot, the, arrow, in, the, direction, of, muhammad, s, voice, and, killed, him, shortly, after, prithviraj, and, chand, bardai, killed, each, other, this, is, a, fictional, narrative, not, supported, by, historical, evidence, muhammad, of, ghor, continued, to, rule, for, more, than, a, decade, after, prithviraj, s, death, after, prithviraj, s, death, the, ghurids, appointed, his, son, govindaraja, on, the, throne, of, ajmer, as, their, vassal, in, 1192, ce, prithviraj, s, younger, brother, hariraja, dethroned, govindaraja, and, recaptured, a, part, of, his, ancestral, kingdom, govindaraja, moved, to, ranastambhapura, modern, ranthambore, where, he, established, a, new, chahamana, branch, of, vassal, rulers, hariraja, was, later, defeated, by, the, ghurid, general, qutb, al, din, aibak, prithviraj, had, a, dedicated, ministry, for, pandits, scholars, and, poets, which, was, under, the, charge, of, padmanabha, his, court, had, a, number, of, poets, and, scholars, including, kharatara, gachchha, pattavali, mentions, a, debate, that, took, place, between, the, jain, monks, jinapati, suri, and, padmaprabha, at, naranayana, modern, narena, near, ajmer, prithviraj, had, encamped, there, at, the, time, jinapati, was, later, invited, to, ajmer, by, a, rich, jain, merchant, there, prithviraj, issued, him, a, jaya, patra, certificate, of, victory, according, to, historian, r, b, singh, at, its, height, prithviraj, s, empire, extended, from, sutlej, river, in, the, west, to, the, betwa, river, in, the, east, and, from, the, himalayan, foothills, in, the, north, to, the, foot, of, mount, abu, in, the, south, thus, it, included, parts, of, present, day, rajasthan, uttrakhand, southern, punjab, northern, madhya, pradesh, himachal, pradesh, and, western, uttar, pradesh, however, according, to, archeologist, rima, hooja, and, historian, r, c, majumdar, prithviraj, inherited, a, kingdom, that, only, stretched, till, modern, day, hissar, and, sirhind, bathinda, on, north, west, and, till, delhi, in, north, his, territories, were, bounded, on, southern, frontier, by, guhilas, of, mewar, along, with, chauhans, of, nadol, on, the, eastern, border, by, kingdoms, of, bayana, kachchhapaghatas, of, gwalior, and, gahadavalas, of, varnasi, and, on, north, west, frontier, by, empire, of, the, ghaznavids, majumdar, further, asserts, that, the, military, campaigns, of, prithviraj, on, his, neighbours, do, not, resulted, in, any, annexation, of, territory, only, seven, inscriptions, dated, to, prithviraj, s, reign, are, available, none, of, these, were, issued, by, the, king, himself, the, late, medieval, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, sanskrit, stories, about, prithviraj, present, him, as, an, unsuccessful, king, who, was, memorable, only, for, his, defeat, against, a, foreign, king, prabandha, chintamani, and, prithviraja, prabandha, written, by, jain, authors, portray, him, as, an, inept, and, unworthy, king, who, was, responsible, for, his, own, downfall, and, whose, mistreatment, of, his, devout, subordinates, turned, them, into, traitors, in, contrast, the, hammira, mahakavya, also, written, by, a, jain, author, presents, him, as, a, brave, man, whose, subordinates, turned, against, him, out, of, pure, greed, the, hammira, mahakavya, which, was, probably, intended, to, please, a, chauhan, lord, retains, the, elements, of, the, jain, tradition, that, occur, in, the, two, prabandha, texts, but, also, attempts, to, glorify, prithviraj, who, was, an, ancestor, of, the, text, s, hero, hammira, prithviraj, raso, a, legendary, text, patronized, largely, by, the, rajput, courts, portrays, prithviraj, as, a, great, hero, over, time, prithviraj, came, to, be, portrayed, as, a, patriotic, hindu, warrior, who, fought, against, muslim, enemies, he, is, remembered, as, a, king, whose, reign, separated, the, two, major, epochs, of, indian, history, the, convention, of, portraying, prithviraj, as, a, hindu, king, defeated, as, part, of, the, islamic, conquest, of, india, appears, to, have, started, with, hasan, nizami, s, tajul, ma, asir, early, 13th, century, nizami, presents, his, narrative, as, a, description, of, war, with, enemies, of, the, faith, and, of, how, the, islamic, way, of, life, was, established, in, the, land, of, the, hindus, tajul, ma, asir, as, well, as, the, later, text, tabaqat, i, nasiri, c, 1260, present, the, ghurid, victory, over, prithviraj, as, an, important, milestone, leading, to, the, establishment, of, the, delhi, sultanate, the, 16th, century, legends, describe, him, as, the, ruler, of, india, s, political, centre, delhi, rather, than, ajmer, which, was, his, actual, capital, for, example, abul, fazl, s, ain, i, akbari, does, not, associate, the, chahamana, dynasty, with, ajmer, at, all, prithviraj, s, association, with, delhi, in, these, legends, further, strengthened, his, status, as, a, symbol, of, pre, islamic, indian, power, prithviraj, has, been, described, as, the, last, hindu, emperor, in, eulogies, this, designation, is, inaccurate, as, several, stronger, hindu, rulers, flourished, in, south, india, after, him, and, even, some, contemporary, hindu, rulers, in, northern, india, were, at, least, as, powerful, as, him, nevertheless, the, 19th, century, british, officer, james, tod, repeatedly, used, this, term, to, describe, prithviraj, in, his, annals, and, antiquities, of, rajast, han, tod, was, influenced, by, the, medieval, persian, language, muslim, accounts, which, present, prithviraj, as, a, major,
