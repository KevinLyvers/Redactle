https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz
hendrik, antoon, lorentz, formemrs, l, r, n, t, s, 18, july, 1853, 4, february, 1928, was, a, dutch, physicist, who, shared, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, pieter, zeeman, for, the, discovery, and, theoretical, explanation, of, the, zeeman, effect, he, derived, the, lorentz, transformation, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, as, well, as, the, lorentz, force, which, describes, the, combined, electric, and, magnetic, forces, acting, on, a, charged, particle, in, an, electromagnetic, field, lorentz, was, also, responsible, for, the, lorentz, oscillator, model, a, classical, model, used, to, describe, the, anomalous, dispersion, observed, in, dielectric, materials, when, the, driving, frequency, of, the, electric, field, was, near, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, material, resulting, in, abnormal, refractive, indices, according, to, the, biography, published, by, the, nobel, foundation, it, may, well, be, said, that, lorentz, was, regarded, by, all, theoretical, physicists, as, the, world, s, leading, spirit, who, completed, what, was, left, unfinished, by, his, predecessors, and, prepared, the, ground, for, the, fruitful, reception, of, the, new, ideas, based, on, the, quantum, theory, he, received, many, other, honours, and, distinctions, including, a, term, as, chairman, of, the, international, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, the, forerunner, of, unesco, between, 1925, and, 1928, he, was, the, father, and, doctoral, advisor, of, geertruida, de, haas, lorentz, hendrik, lorentz, was, born, in, arnhem, gelderland, netherlands, the, son, of, gerrit, frederik, lorentz, 1822, 1893, a, well, off, horticulturist, and, geertruida, van, ginkel, 1826, 1861, in, 1862, after, his, mother, s, death, his, father, married, luberta, hupkes, despite, being, raised, as, a, protestant, he, was, a, freethinker, in, religious, matters, and, regularly, attended, catholic, mass, in, his, local, french, church, from, 1866, to, 1869, he, attended, the, hogere, burgerschool, in, arnhem, a, new, type, of, public, high, school, recently, established, by, johan, rudolph, thorbecke, his, results, in, school, were, exemplary, not, only, did, he, excel, in, the, physical, sciences, and, mathematics, but, also, in, english, french, and, german, in, 1870, he, passed, the, exams, in, classical, languages, which, were, then, required, for, admission, to, university, lorentz, studied, physics, and, mathematics, at, leiden, university, where, he, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, teaching, of, astronomy, professor, frederik, kaiser, it, was, his, influence, that, led, him, to, become, a, physicist, after, earning, a, bachelor, s, degree, he, returned, to, arnhem, in, 1871, to, teach, night, school, classes, in, mathematics, but, he, continued, his, studies, in, leiden, in, addition, to, his, teaching, position, in, 1875, lorentz, earned, a, doctoral, degree, under, pieter, rijke, on, a, thesis, entitled, over, de, theorie, der, terugkaatsing, en, breking, van, het, licht, on, the, theory, of, reflection, and, refraction, of, light, in, which, he, refined, the, electromagnetic, theory, of, james, clerk, maxwell, on, 17, november, 1877, only, 24, years, of, age, lorentz, was, appointed, to, the, newly, established, chair, in, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, leiden, the, position, had, initially, been, offered, to, johan, van, der, waals, but, he, accepted, a, position, at, the, universiteit, van, amsterdam, on, 25, january, 1878, lorentz, delivered, his, inaugural, lecture, on, de, moleculaire, theori, n, in, de, natuurkunde, the, molecular, theories, in, physics, in, 1881, he, became, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, during, the, first, twenty, years, in, leiden, lorentz, was, primarily, interested, in, the, electromagnetic, theory, of, electricity, magnetism, and, light, after, that, he, extended, his, research, to, a, much, wider, area, while, still, focusing, on, theoretical, physics, lorentz, made, significant, contributions, to, fields, ranging, from, hydrodynamics, to, general, relativity, his, most, important, contributions, were, in, the, area, of, electromagnetism, the, electron, theory, and, relativity, lorentz, theorized, that, atoms, might, consist, of, charged, particles, and, suggested, that, the, oscillations, of, these, charged, particles, were, the, source, of, light, when, a, colleague, and, former, student, of, lorentz, s, pieter, zeeman, discovered, the, zeeman, effect, in, 1896, lorentz, supplied, its, theoretical, interpretation, the, experimental, and, theoretical, work, was, honored, with, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1902, lorentz, name, is, now, associated, with, the, lorentz, lorenz, equation, the, lorentz, force, the, lorentzian, distribution, the, lorentz, oscillator, model, and, the, lorentz, transformation, in, 1892, and, 1895, lorentz, worked, on, describing, electromagnetic, phenomena, the, propagation, of, light, in, reference, frames, that, move, relative, to, the, postulated, luminiferous, aether, he, discovered, that, the, transition, from, one, to, another, reference, frame, could, be, simplified, by, using, a, new, time, variable, that, he, called, local, time, and, which, depended, on, universal, time, and, the, location, under, consideration, although, lorentz, did, not, give, a, detailed, interpretation, of, the, physical, significance, of, local, time, with, it, he, could, explain, the, aberration, of, light, and, the, result, of, the, fizeau, experiment, in, 1900, and, 1904, henri, poincar, called, local, time, lorentz, s, most, ingenious, idea, and, illustrated, it, by, showing, that, clocks, in, moving, frames, are, synchronized, by, exchanging, light, signals, that, are, assumed, to, travel, at, the, same, speed, against, and, with, the, motion, of, the, frame, see, einstein, synchronisation, and, relativity, of, simultaneity, in, 1892, with, the, attempt, to, explain, the, michelson, morley, experiment, lorentz, also, proposed, that, moving, bodies, contract, in, the, direction, of, motion, see, length, contraction, george, fitzgerald, had, already, arrived, at, this, conclusion, in, 1889, in, 1899, and, again, in, 1904, lorentz, added, time, dilation, to, his, transformations, and, published, what, poincar, in, 1905, named, lorentz, transformations, it, was, apparently, unknown, to, lorentz, that, joseph, larmor, had, used, identical, transformations, to, describe, orbiting, electrons, in, 1897, larmor, s, and, lorentz, s, equations, look, somewhat, dissimilar, but, they, are, algebraically, equivalent, to, those, presented, by, poincar, and, einstein, in, 1905, lorentz, s, 1904, paper, includes, the, covariant, formulation, of, electrodynamics, in, which, electrodynamic, phenomena, in, different, reference, frames, are, described, by, identical, equations, with, well, defined, transformation, properties, the, paper, clearly, recognizes, the, significance, of, this, formulation, namely, that, the, outcomes, of, electrodynamic, experiments, do, not, depend, on, the, relative, motion, of, the, reference, frame, the, 1904, paper, includes, a, detailed, discussion, of, the, increase, of, the, inertial, mass, of, rapidly, moving, objects, in, a, useless, attempt, to, make, momentum, look, exactly, like, newtonian, momentum, it, was, also, an, attempt, to, explain, the, length, contraction, as, the, accumulation, of, stuff, onto, mass, making, it, slow, and, contract, in, 1905, einstein, would, use, many, of, the, concepts, mathematical, tools, and, results, lorentz, discussed, to, write, his, paper, entitled, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, known, today, as, the, special, theory, of, relativity, because, lorentz, laid, the, fundamentals, for, the, work, by, einstein, this, theory, was, originally, called, the, lorentz, einstein, theory, in, 1906, lorentz, s, electron, theory, received, a, full, fledged, treatment, in, his, lectures, at, columbia, university, published, under, the, title, the, theory, of, electrons, the, increase, of, mass, was, the, first, prediction, of, lorentz, and, einstein, to, be, tested, but, some, experiments, by, kaufmann, appeared, to, show, a, slightly, different, mass, increase, this, led, lorentz, to, the, famous, remark, that, he, was, au, bout, de, mon, latin, at, the, end, of, my, latin, at, his, wit, s, end, the, confirmation, of, his, prediction, had, to, wait, until, 1908, and, later, see, kaufmann, bucherer, neumann, experiments, lorentz, published, a, series, of, papers, dealing, with, what, he, called, einstein, s, principle, of, relativity, for, instance, in, 1909, 1910, 1914, in, his, 1906, lectures, published, with, additions, in, 1909, in, the, book, the, theory, of, electrons, updated, in, 1915, he, spoke, affirmatively, of, einstein, s, theory, it, will, be, clear, by, what, has, been, said, that, the, impressions, received, by, the, two, observers, a0, and, a, would, be, alike, in, all, respects, it, would, be, impossible, to, decide, which, of, them, moves, or, stands, still, with, respect, to, the, ether, and, there, would, be, no, reason, for, preferring, the, times, and, lengths, measured, by, the, one, to, those, determined, by, the, other, nor, for, saying, that, either, of, them, is, in, possession, of, the, true, times, or, the, true, lengths, this, is, a, point, which, einstein, has, laid, particular, stress, on, in, a, theory, in, which, he, starts, from, what, he, calls, the, principle, of, relativity, i, cannot, speak, here, of, the, many, highly, interesting, applications, which, einstein, has, made, of, this, principle, his, results, concerning, electromagnetic, and, optical, phenomena, agree, in, the, main, with, those, which, we, have, obtained, in, the, preceding, pages, the, chief, difference, being, that, einstein, simply, postulates, what, we, have, deduced, with, some, difficulty, and, not, altogether, satisfactorily, from, the, fundamental, equations, of, the, electromagnetic, field, by, doing, so, he, may, certainly, take, credit, for, making, us, see, in, the, negative, result, of, experiments, like, those, of, michelson, rayleigh, and, brace, not, a, fortuitous, compensation, of, opposing, effects, but, the, manifestation, of, a, general, and, fundamental, principle, it, would, be, unjust, not, to, add, that, besides, the, fascinating, boldness, of, its, starting, point, einstein, s, theory, has, another, marked, advantage, over, mine, whereas, i, have, not, been, able, to, obtain, for, the, equations, referred, to, moving, axes, exactly, the, same, form, as, for, those, which, apply, to, a, stationary, system, einstein, has, accomplished, this, by, means, of, a, system, of, new, variables, slightly, different, from, those, which, i, have, introduced, though, lorentz, still, maintained, that, there, is, an, undetectable, aether, in, which, resting, clocks, indicate, the, true, time, 1909, yet, i, think, something, may, also, be, claimed, in, favour, of, the, form, in, which, i, have, presented, the, theory, i, cannot, but, regard, the, ether, which, can, be, the, seat, of, an, electromagnetic, field, with, its, energy, and, its, vibrations, as, endowed, with, a, certain, degree, of, substantiality, however, different, it, may, be, from, all, ordinary, matter, 1910, provided, that, there, is, an, aether, then, under, all, systems, x, y, z, t, one, is, preferred, by, the, fact, that, the, coordinate, axes, as, well, as, the, clocks, are, resting, in, the, aether, if, one, connects, with, this, the, idea, which, i, would, abandon, only, reluctantly, that, space, and, time, are, completely, different, things, and, that, there, is, a, true, time, simultaneity, thus, would, be, independent, of, the, location, in, agreement, with, the, circumstance, that, we, can, have, the, idea, of, infinitely, great, velocities, then, it, can, be, easily, seen, that, this, true, time, should, be, indicated, by, clocks, at, rest, in, the, aether, however, if, the, relativity, principle, had, general, validity, in, nature, one, wouldn, t, be, in, the, position, to, determine, whether, the, reference, system, just, used, is, the, preferred, one, then, one, comes, to, the, same, results, as, if, one, following, einstein, and, minkowski, deny, the, existence, of, the, aether, and, of, true, time, and, to, see, all, reference, systems, as, equally, valid, which, of, these, two, ways, of, thinking, one, is, following, can, surely, be, left, to, the, individual, lorentz, also, gave, credit, to, poincar, s, contributions, to, relativity, indeed, for, some, of, the, physical, quantities, which, enter, the, formulas, i, did, not, indicate, the, transformation, which, suits, best, that, was, done, by, poincar, and, then, by, mr, einstein, and, minkowski, i, did, not, succeed, in, obtaining, the, exact, invariance, of, the, equations, poincar, on, the, contrary, obtained, a, perfect, invariance, of, the, equations, of, electrodynamics, and, he, formulated, the, postulate, of, relativity, terms, which, he, was, the, first, to, employ, let, us, add, that, by, correcting, the, imperfections, of, my, work, he, never, reproached, me, for, them, lorentz, was, one, of, few, scientists, who, supported, einstein, s, search, for, general, relativity, from, the, beginning, he, wrote, several, research, papers, and, discussed, with, einstein, personally, and, by, letter, for, instance, he, attempted, to, combine, einstein, s, formalism, with, hamilton, s, principle, 1915, and, to, reformulate, it, in, a, coordinate, free, way, 1916, lorentz, wrote, in, 1919, the, total, eclipse, of, the, sun, of, may, 29, resulted, in, a, striking, confirmation, of, the, new, theory, of, the, universal, attractive, power, of, gravitation, developed, by, albert, einstein, and, thus, reinforced, the, conviction, that, the, defining, of, this, theory, is, one, of, the, most, important, steps, ever, taken, in, the, domain, of, natural, science, lorentz, gave, a, series, of, lectures, in, the, fall, of, 1926, at, cornell, university, on, the, new, quantum, mechanics, in, these, he, presented, erwin, schr, dinger, s, wave, mechanics, einstein, wrote, of, lorentz, 1928, the, enormous, significance, of, his, work, consisted, therein, that, it, forms, the, basis, for, the, theory, of, atoms, and, for, the, general, and, special, theories, of, relativity, the, special, theory, was, a, more, detailed, expose, of, those, concepts, which, are, found, in, lorentz, s, research, of, 1895, 1953, for, me, personally, he, meant, more, than, all, the, others, i, have, met, on, my, life, s, journey, poincar, 1902, said, of, lorentz, s, theory, of, electrodynamics, the, most, satisfactory, theory, is, that, of, lorentz, it, is, unquestionably, the, theory, that, best, explains, the, known, facts, the, one, that, throws, into, relief, the, greatest, number, of, known, relations, it, is, due, to, lorentz, that, the, results, of, fizeau, on, the, optics, of, moving, bodies, the, laws, of, normal, and, abnormal, dispersion, and, of, absorption, are, connected, with, each, other, look, at, the, ease, with, which, the, new, zeeman, phenomenon, found, its, place, and, even, aided, the, classification, of, faraday, s, magnetic, rotation, which, had, defied, all, maxwell, s, efforts, paul, langevin, 1911, said, of, lorentz, it, will, be, lorentz, s, main, claim, to, fame, that, he, demonstrated, that, the, fundamental, equations, of, electromagnetism, also, allow, of, a, group, of, transformations, that, enables, them, to, resume, the, same, form, when, a, transition, is, made, from, one, reference, system, to, another, this, group, differs, fundamentally, from, the, above, group, as, regards, transformations, of, space, and, time, lorentz, and, emil, wiechert, had, an, interesting, correspondence, on, the, topics, of, electromagnetism, and, the, theory, of, relativity, and, lorentz, explained, his, ideas, in, letters, to, wiechert, lorentz, was, chairman, of, the, first, solvay, conference, held, in, brussels, in, the, autumn, of, 1911, shortly, after, the, conference, poincar, wrote, an, essay, on, quantum, physics, which, gives, an, indication, of, lorentz, s, status, at, the, time, at, every, moment, the, twenty, physicists, from, different, countries, could, be, heard, talking, of, the, which, they, contrasted, with, the, old, mechanics, now, what, was, the, old, mechanics, was, it, that, of, newton, the, one, which, still, reigned, uncontested, at, the, close, of, the, nineteenth, century, no, it, was, the, mechanics, of, lorentz, the, one, dealing, with, the, principle, of, relativity, the, one, which, hardly, five, years, ago, seemed, to, be, the, height, of, boldness, in, 1910, lorentz, decided, to, reorganize, his, life, his, teaching, and, management, duties, at, leiden, university, were, taking, up, too, much, of, his, time, leaving, him, little, time, for, research, in, 1912, he, resigned, from, his, chair, of, theoretical, physics, to, become, curator, of, the, physics, cabinet, at, teylers, museum, in, haarlem, he, remained, connected, to, leiden, university, as, an, external, professor, and, his, monday, morning, lectures, on, new, developments, in, theoretical, physics, soon, became, legendary, lorentz, initially, asked, einstein, to, succeed, him, as, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, leiden, however, einstein, could, not, accept, because, he, had, just, accepted, a, position, at, eth, zurich, einstein, had, no, regrets, in, this, matter, since, the, prospect, of, having, to, fill, lorentz, s, shoes, made, him, shiver, instead, lorentz, appointed, paul, ehrenfest, as, his, successor, in, the, chair, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, leiden, university, who, would, found, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, which, would, become, known, as, the, lorentz, institute, after, world, war, i, lorentz, was, one, of, the, driving, forces, behind, the, founding, of, the, wetenschappelijke, commissie, van, advies, en, onderzoek, in, het, belang, van, volkswelvaart, en, weerbaarheid, a, committee, which, was, to, harness, the, scientific, potential, united, in, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, knaw, for, solving, civil, problems, such, as, food, shortage, which, had, resulted, from, the, war, lorentz, was, appointed, chair, of, the, committee, however, despite, the, best, efforts, of, many, of, the, participants, the, committee, would, harvest, little, success, the, only, exception, being, that, it, ultimately, resulted, in, the, founding, of, tno, the, netherlands, organisation, for, applied, scientific, research, lorentz, was, also, asked, by, the, dutch, government, to, chair, a, committee, to, calculate, some, of, the, effects, of, the, proposed, afsluitdijk, enclosure, dam, flood, control, dam, on, water, levels, in, the, waddenzee, hydraulic, engineering, was, mainly, an, empirical, science, at, that, time, but, the, disturbance, of, the, tidal, flow, caused, by, the, afsluitdijk, was, so, unprecedented, that, the, empirical, rules, could, not, be, trusted, originally, lorentz, was, only, supposed, to, have, a, coordinating, role, in, the, committee, but, it, quickly, became, apparent, that, lorentz, was, the, only, physicist, to, have, any, fundamental, traction, on, the, problem, in, the, period, 1918, till, 1926, lorentz, invested, a, large, portion, of, his, time, in, the, problem, lorentz, proposed, to, start, from, the, basic, hydrodynamic, equations, of, motion, and, solve, the, problem, numerically, this, was, feasible, for, a, human, computer, because, of, the, quasi, one, dimensional, nature, of, the, water, flow, in, the, waddenzee, the, afsluitdijk, was, completed, in, 1932, and, the, predictions, of, lorentz, and, his, committee, turned, out, to, be, remarkably, accurate, one, of, the, two, sets, of, locks, in, the, afsluitdijk, was, named, after, him, in, 1881, lorentz, married, aletta, catharina, kaiser, her, father, was, j, w, kaiser, a, professor, at, the, academy, of, fine, arts, he, was, the, director, of, the, museum, which, later, became, the, well, known, rijksmuseum, national, gallery, he, also, was, the, designer, of, the, first, postage, stamps, of, the, netherlands, there, were, two, daughters, and, one, son, from, this, marriage, dr, geertruida, luberta, lorentz, the, eldest, daughter, was, a, physicist, she, married, professor, wander, johannes, de, haas, who, was, the, director, of, the, cryogenic, laboratory, at, the, university, of, leiden, in, january, 1928, lorentz, became, seriously, ill, and, died, shortly, after, on, 4, february, the, respect, in, which, he, was, held, in, the, netherlands, is, apparent, from, owen, willans, richardson, s, description, of, his, funeral, the, funeral, took, place, at, haarlem, at, noon, on, friday, february, 10, at, the, stroke, of, twelve, the, state, telegraph, and, telephone, services, of, holland, were, suspended, for, three, minutes, as, a, revered, tribute, to, the, greatest, man, the, netherlands, has, produced, in, our, time, it, was, attended, by, many, colleagues, and, distinguished, physicists, from, foreign, countries, the, president, sir, ernest, rutherford, represented, the, royal, society, and, made, an, appreciative, oration, by, the, graveside, unique, 1928, film, footage, of, the, funeral, procession, with, a, lead, carriage, followed, by, ten, mourners, followed, by, a, carriage, with, the, coffin, followed, in, turn, by, at, least, four, more, carriages, passing, by, a, crowd, at, the, grote, markt, haarlem, from, the, zijlstraat, to, the, smedestraat, and, then, back, again, through, the, grote, houtstraat, towards, the, barteljorisstraat, on, the, way, to, the, algemene, begraafplaats, at, the, kleverlaan, northern, haarlem, cemetery, has, been, digitized, on, youtube, amongst, others, the, funeral, was, attended, by, albert, einstein, and, maria, sk, odowska, curie, lorentz, is, considered, one, of, the, prime, representatives, of, the, second, dutch, golden, age, a, period, of, several, decades, surrounding, 1900, in, which, the, natural, sciences, flourished, in, the, netherlands, richardson, describes, lorentz, as, a, man, of, remarkable, intellectual, powers, although, steeped, in, his, own, investigation, of, the, moment, he, always, seemed, to, have, in, his, immediate, grasp, its, ramifications, into, every, corner, of, the, universe, the, singular, clearness, of, his, writings, provides, a, striking, reflection, of, his, wonderful, powers, in, this, respect, he, possessed, and, successfully, employed, the, mental, vivacity, which, is, necessary, to, follow, the, interplay, of, discussion, the, insight, which, is, required, to, extract, those, statements, which, illuminate, the, real, difficulties, and, the, wisdom, to, lead, the, discussion, among, fruitful, channels, and, he, did, this, so, skillfully, that, the, process, was, hardly, perceptible, m, j, klein, 1967, wrote, of, lorentz, s, reputation, in, the, 1920s, for, many, years, physicists, had, always, been, eager, to, hear, what, lorentz, will, say, about, it, when, a, new, theory, was, advanced, and, even, at, seventy, two, he, did, not, disappoint, them, in, addition, to, the, nobel, prize, lorentz, received, a, great, many, honours, for, his, outstanding, work, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1905, the, society, awarded, him, their, rumford, medal, in, 1908, and, their, copley, medal, in, 1918, he, was, elected, an, honorary, member, of, the, netherlands, chemical, society, in, 1912, he, was, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, and, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences
