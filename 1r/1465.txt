to, vote, at, a, party, convention, in, early, 1971, in, d, sseldorf, kohl, was, unable, to, prevail, against, protest, coming, from, the, conservative, wing, of, the, party, around, alfred, dregger, and, the, sister, party, csu, costing, him, support, at, the, liberal, wing, of, the, party, to, make, matters, worse, in, a, mistake, during, the, voting, process, kohl, himself, voted, against, the,

again, kohl, succeeded, him, at, a, party, convention, in, bonn, on, 12, june, 1973, amassing, 520, of, 600, votes, with, him, as, the, only, candidate, facing, stiff, opposition, from, the, left, wing, of, the, party, kohl, initially, expected, only, to, serve, as, chairman, for, a, couple, of, months, as, his, critics, planned, to, replace, him, at, another, convention, set, for, november, in, hamburg, kohl, received, the, support, of, his, party, and, remained, in, office, not, least, due, to, the, lauded, work, of, kurt, biedenkopf, whom, kohl, had, brought, in, as, secretary, general, of, the, cdu, kohl, remained, chairman, until, 1998, when, chancellor, brandt, stepped, down, in, may, 1974, following, the, unravelling, of, the, guillaume, affair, kohl, urged, his, party, to, restrain, from, schadenfreude, and, not, to, use, the, position, of, their, political, opponent, for, cheap, polemics, in, june, kohl, campaigned, during, the, state, elections, in, lower, saxony, for, his, party, colleague, wilfried, hasselmann, leading, the, cdu, to, a, strong, result, of, 48, 8, of, the, vote, even, though, it, proved, not, enough, to, prevent, a, continuation, of, the, social, liberal, coalition, in, the, state, on, 9, march, 1975, kohl, and, the, cdu, faced, re, election, in, rhineland, palatinate, what, placed, kohl, who, intended, to, run, for, chancellor, under, increased, pressure, was, the, fact, that, the, sister, parties, of, cdu, and, csu, were, set, to, decide, upon, their, leading, candidate, for, the, upcoming, federal, elections, in, mid, 1975, csu, chairman, franz, josef, strauss, had, ambitions, to, run, and, publicly, put, kohl, under, pressure, over, what, a, result, would, be, acceptable, in, the, state, elections, on, election, day, the, cdu, achieved, a, result, of, 53, 9, per, cent, the, highest, ever, result, in, the, state, consolidating, kohl, s, position, strau, bid, for, the, chancellorship, was, further, put, into, jeopardy, when, in, march, 1975, the, magazine, der, spiegel, published, a, transcript, of, a, speech, held, in, november, 1974, in, which, strau, claimed, that, the, red, army, faction, a, west, german, armed, struggle, group, responsible, for, multiple, attacks, at, the, time, had, sympathizers, in, the, ranks, of, the, spd, and, fdp, the, scandal, deeply, unsettled, the, public, and, effectively, ruled, out, strau, for, the, candidacy, on, 12, may, 1975, the, federal, board, of, the, cdu, unanimously, nominated, kohl, as, the, candidate, for, the, general, elections, without, consulting, their, bavarian, sister, party, beforehand, in, reaction, the, csu, nominated, strau, and, only, a, mediation, by, former, chancellor, kiesinger, was, able, to, resolve, the, issue, and, confirm, kohl, as, the, candidate, for, both, parties, in, june, 1975, kohl, was, also, re, elected, as, party, chairman, achieving, a, result, of, 98, 44, per, cent, strau, took, the, discord, as, a, starting, point, to, evaluate, chances, of, expanding, the, csu, on, the, federal, level, such, as, having, separate, electoral, lists, in, the, states, of, north, rhine, westphalia, lower, saxony, hamburg, and, bremen, he, hoped, to, draw, away, right, wing, voters, from, the, fdp, towards, the, csu, and, went, as, far, as, having, private, meetings, with, industrialists, in, north, rhine, westphalia, these, attempts, led, to, discomfort, within, the, membership, base, of, the, cdu, and, hampered, both, parties, chances, in, the, upcoming, elections, kohl, himself, remained, silent, during, these, tensions, which, some, interpreted, as, a, lack, of, leadership, while, others, such, as, future, president, karl, carstens, praised, him, for, seeking, a, consensus, at, the, centre, of, the, party, in, the, 1976, federal, election, the, cdu, csu, coalition, performed, very, well, winning, 48, 6, of, the, vote, they, were, kept, out, of, government, by, the, center, left, cabinet, formed, by, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, spd, and, free, democratic, party, fdp, led, by, social, democrat, helmut, schmidt, kohl, then, retired, as, minister, president, of, rhineland, palatinate, to, become, the, leader, of, the, cdu, csu, in, the, bundestag, he, was, succeeded, by, bernhard, vogel, in, the, 1980, federal, elections, kohl, had, to, play, second, fiddle, when, csu, leader, franz, josef, strauss, became, the, cdu, csu, s, candidate, for, chancellor, strau, was, also, unable, to, defeat, the, coalition, of, the, spd, and, the, fdp, unlike, kohl, strau, did, not, want, to, continue, as, the, leader, of, the, cdu, csu, and, remained, minister, president, of, bavaria, kohl, remained, as, leader, of, the, opposition, under, the, third, schmidt, cabinet, 1980, 82, on, 17, september, 1982, a, conflict, of, economic, policy, occurred, between, the, governing, spd, fdp, coalition, partners, the, fdp, wanted, to, radically, liberalise, the, labour, market, while, the, spd, preferred, greater, job, security, the, fdp, began, talks, with, the, cdu, csu, to, form, a, new, government, on, 1, october, 1982, the, cdu, proposed, a, constructive, vote, of, no, confidence, which, was, supported, by, the, fdp, the, motion, carried, to, date, the, only, time, that, a, chancellor, has, been, deposed, in, this, manner, three, days, later, the, bundestag, voted, in, a, new, cdu, csu, fdp, coalition, cabinet, with, kohl, as, chancellor, many, of, the, important, details, of, the, new, coalition, had, been, hammered, out, on, 20, september, though, minor, details, were, reportedly, still, being, negotiated, as, the, vote, took, place, though, kohl, s, election, was, done, according, to, the, basic, law, it, came, amid, some, controversy, the, fdp, had, fought, its, 1980, campaign, on, the, side, of, the, spd, and, even, placed, chancellor, schmidt, on, some, of, their, campaign, posters, there, were, also, doubts, that, the, new, government, had, the, support, of, a, majority, of, the, people, in, answer, the, new, government, aimed, at, new, elections, at, the, earliest, possible, date, polls, suggested, that, a, clear, majority, was, indeed, in, reach, as, the, basic, law, only, allows, the, dissolution, of, parliament, after, an, unsuccessful, confidence, motion, kohl, had, to, take, another, controversial, move, he, called, for, a, confidence, vote, only, a, month, after, being, sworn, in, which, he, intentionally, lost, because, the, members, of, his, coalition, abstained, president, karl, carstens, then, dissolved, the, bundestag, at, kohl, s, request, and, called, new, elections, the, move, was, controversial, as, the, coalition, parties, denied, their, votes, to, the, same, man, they, had, elected, chancellor, a, month, before, and, whom, they, wanted, to, re, elect, after, the, parliamentary, election, however, this, step, was, condoned, by, the, german, federal, constitutional, court, as, a, legal, instrument, and, was, again, applied, by, spd, chancellor, gerhard, schr, der, in, 2005, in, the, federal, elections, of, march, 1983, kohl, won, a, resounding, victory, the, cdu, csu, won, 48, 8, while, the, fdp, won, 7, 0, some, opposition, members, of, the, bundestag, angered, by, what, spd, figures, in, the, hessian, regional, elections, had, called, the, fdp, s, betrayal, in, bonn, asked, the, federal, constitutional, court, to, declare, the, whole, proceeding, unconstitutional, it, denied, their, claim, but, did, set, restrictions, on, a, similar, move, in, the, future, the, second,

first, ever, visit, by, an, east, german, head, of, state, to, west, germany, this, is, generally, seen, as, a, sign, that, kohl, pursued, ostpolitik, a, policy, of, d, tente, between, east, and, west, that, had, been, begun, by, the, spd, led, governments, and, strongly, opposed, by, kohl, s, own, cdu, during, the, 1970s, the, cdu, s, general, secretary, heiner, gei, ler, considered, the, party, to, be, in, a, downward, spiral, following, the, relatively, poor, showing, in, the, 1987, elections, behind, the, scenes, he, attempted, to, find, a, majority, to, unseat, kohl, as, the, party, s, chairman, and, replace, him, with, lothar, sp, th, the, minister, president, of, baden, w, rttemberg, before, the, cdu, party, convention, in, bremen, started, on, 11, september, 1989, kohl, was, diagnosed, with, an, inflammation, of, his, prostate, his, doctor, recommended, immediate, surgery, but, kohl, refused, to, miss, the, convention, and, attended, while, wearing, a, catheter, and, with, his, doctor, by, his, side, whom, he, introduced, as, his, new, speech, writer, in, the, end, the, coup, was, unsuccessful, as, kohl, was, re, elected, as, chairman, with, 79, 52, of, the, votes, sp, th, who, did, not, stand, for, the, position, of, chairman, after, support, for, kohl, became, apparent, was, punished, by, his, party, failing, to, be, elected, as, vice, chairman, with, just, 357, of, 731, votes, gei, ler, meanwhile, was, relieved, of, his, duties, as, general, secretary, and, replaced, by, volker, r, he, following, the, breach, of, the, berlin, wall, and, the, collapse, of, the, east, german, communist, regime, in, 1989, kohl, s, handling, of, the, east, german, issue, would, become, the, turning, point, of, his, chancellorship, kohl, like, most, west, germans, was, initially, caught, unaware, when, the, socialist, unity, party, was, toppled, in, late, 1989, well, aware, of, his, constitutional, mandate, to, seek, german, unity, he, immediately, moved, to, make, it, a, reality, taking, advantage, of, the, historic, political, changes, occurring, in, east, germany, kohl, presented, a, ten, point, plan, for, overcoming, of, the, division, of, germany, and, europe, without, consulting, his, coalition, partner, the, fdp, or, the, western, allies, in, february, 1990, he, visited, the, soviet, union, seeking, a, guarantee, from, mikhail, gorbachev, that, the, ussr, would, allow, german, reunification, to, proceed, one, month, later, the, party, of, democratic, socialism, the, renamed, sed, was, roundly, defeated, by, a, grand, coalition, headed, by, the, east, german, counterpart, of, kohl, s, cdu, which, ran, on, a, platform, of, speedy, reunification, on, 18, may, 1990, kohl, signed, an, economic, and, social, union, treaty, with, east, germany, this, treaty, stipulated, that, when, reunification, took, place, it, would, be, under, the, quicker, provisions, of, article, 23, of, the, basic, law, that, article, stated, that, any, new, states, could, adhere, to, the, basic, law, by, a, simple, majority, vote, the, alternative, would, have, been, the, more, protracted, route, of, drafting, a, completely, new, constitution, for, the, newly, reunified, country, as, provided, by, article, 146, of, the, basic, law, however, the, article, 146, process, would, have, opened, up, contentious, issues, in, west, germany, even, without, this, to, consider, by, this, time, east, germany, was, in, a, state, of, utter, collapse, in, contrast, an, article, 23, reunification, could, be, completed, in, as, little, as, six, months, over, the, objections, of, bundesbank, president, karl, otto, p, hl, he, allowed, a, 1, 1, exchange, rate, for, wages, interest, and, rent, between, the, west, and, east, marks, in, the, end, this, policy, would, seriously, hurt, companies, in, the, new, federal, states, together, with, foreign, minister, hans, dietrich, genscher, kohl, was, able, to, resolve, talks, with, the, former, allies, of, world, war, ii, to, allow, german, reunification, he, received, assurances, from, gorbachev, that, a, reunified, germany, would, be, able, to, choose, which, international, alliance, it, wanted, to, join, although, kohl, made, no, secret, that, he, wanted, the, reunified, germany, to, inherit, west, germany, s, seats, at, nato, and, the, ec, a, reunification, treaty, was, signed, on, 31, august, 1990, and, was, overwhelmingly, approved, by, both, parliaments, on, 20, september, 1990, at, midnight, central, european, time, on, 3, october, 1990, east, germany, officially, ceased, to, exist, and, its, territory, joined, the, federal, republic, as, the, five, states, of, brandenburg, mecklenburg, vorpommern, saxony, saxony, anhalt, and, thuringia, these, states, had, been, the, original, five, states, of, east, germany, before, being, abolished, in, 1952, and, had, been, reconstituted, in, august, east, and, west, berlin, were, reunited, as, a, city, state, which, became, the, capital, of, the, enlarged, federal, republic, after, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, kohl, affirmed, that, former, german, territories, east, of, the, oder, neisse, line, were, definitively, part, of, poland, thereby, relinquishing, any, claim, germany, had, to, them, in, a, treaty, signed, on, 14, november, 1990, in, warsaw, though, earlier, in, march, of, that, year, kohl, caused, a, diplomatic, firestorm, when, he, suggested, that, a, reunified, germany, would, not, accept, the, oder, neisse, line, and, implied, that, the, federal, republic, might, wish, to, restore, the, frontier, of, 1937, by, force, if, necessary, after, the, statement, caused, a, major, international, backlash, that, threatened, to, halt, german, reunification, kohl, retracted, his, comments, after, knuckling, under, international, rebuke, and, assured, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, that, a, reunified, germany, would, accept, the, oder, neisse, line, as, the, final, border, between, poland, and, germany, in, 1993, kohl, confirmed, via, treaty, with, the, czech, republic, that, germany, would, no, longer, bring, forward, territorial, claims, as, to, the, pre, 1945, ethnic, german, sudetenland, this, treaty, was, a, disappointment, for, the, german, heimatvertriebene, displaced, persons, reunification, placed, kohl, in, a, momentarily, unassailable, position, in, the, 1990, elections, the, first, free, fair, and, democratic, all, german, elections, since, the, weimar, republic, era, kohl, won, by, a, landslide, over, opposition,

reduced, majority, defeating, minister, president, of, rhineland, palatinate, rudolf, scharping, the, spd, was, able, to, win, a, majority, in, the, bundesrat, which, significantly, limited, kohl, s, power, in, foreign, politics, kohl, was, more, successful, for, instance, getting, frankfurt, am, main, as, the, seat, for, the, european, central, bank, in, 1997, kohl, received, the, vision, for, europe, award, for, his, efforts, in, the, unification, of, europe, by, the, late, 1990s, kohl, s, popularity, had, dropped, amid, rising, unemployment, he, was, defeated, by, a, large, margin, in,

a, member, of, the, bundestag, until, he, decided, not, to, run, for, reelection, in, the, 2002, election, kohl, s, life, after, political, office, in, the, beginning, was, dominated, by, the, cdu, donations, scandal, the, party, financing, scandal, became, public, in, 1999, when, it, was, discovered, that, the, cdu, had, received, and, kept, illegal, donations, during, kohl, s, leadership, der, spiegel, reported, it, was, never, suggested, that, kohl, benefited, personally, from, political, donations, but, he, did, lead, the, party, financial, system, outside, of, the, legal, boundaries, doing, such, things, as, opening, secret, bank, accounts, and, establishing, civic, associations, that, could, act, as, middle, men, or, procurement, agencies, for, campaign, donations, while, his, reputation, in, germany, suffered, in, the, immediate, years, after, the, finance, affair, it, did, not, affect, his, reputation, internationally, outside, of, germany, he, was, perceived, as, a, great, european, statesman, and, remembered, for, his, role, in, solving, the, five, great, problems, of, his, era, german, reunification, european, integration, the, relations, with, russia, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, bosnian, war, in, 2002, kohl, left, the, bundestag, and, officially, retired, from, politics, later, he, was, largely, rehabilitated, by, his, party,

the, european, debt, crisis, and, later, also, towards, russia, in, the, russo, ukrainian, war, which, he, saw, as, opposed, to, his, politics, of, peaceful, bi, lateral, european, integration, during, his, time, as, chancellor, he, published, the, book, aus, sorge, um, europa, out, of, concern, for, europe, outlining, these, criticisms, of, merkel, while, also, attacking, his, immediate,

for, committing, to, nuclear, power, phaseout, by, 2022, following, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, disaster, saying, that, a, nuclear, phase, out, would, make, the, world, a, more, dangerous,

president, fran, ois, mitterrand, parallel, to, this, he, was, committed, to, german, reunification, although, he, continued, the, ostpolitik, of, his, social, democratic, predecessors, kohl,

west, german, political, left, and, was, mocked, for, his, large, physical, stature, alleged, provinciality, simplistic, language, and, slight, local, palatinate, dialect, including, hypercorrections, similar, to, historical, french, cartoons, of, louis, philippe, of, france, hans, traxler, depicted, kohl, as, a, pear, in, the, left, leaning, satirical, journal, titanic, the, german, word, birne,

rhineland, palatinate, 1969, 1976, was, a, young, reformer, in, a, somewhat, backward, state, and, a, newcomer, who, heavily, criticised, the, older, party, leaders, the, national, media, for, as, much, as, they, took, notice, of, him, regarded, him, with, curiosity, but, this, changed, when, kohl, became, chair, of, the, federal, party, in, 1973, and, even, more, dramatically, when, in, late, 1975, his, party, made, him, candidate, for, the, chancellery, his, opponents, within, the, federal, party, but, also, journalists, and, other, observers, had, their, doubts, whether, the, parochial, though, successful, moderniser, of, a, manageable, smaller, state, was, the, right, person, to, lead, the, federal, republic, a, big, and, complicated, industrial, country, biographer, hans, peter,

profound, knowledge, of, economics, but, also, a, lack, of, charisma, and, no, cultural, acceptance, in, northern, germany, in, small, circles, kohl, was, fascinating, and, a, perfect, host, the, larger, the, crowd, the, vaguer, weaker, and, paler, he, appeared, his, gaze, into, tv, cameras, made, him, look, helpless, when, attacked, e, g, in, election, campaigns, he, became, a, good, fighter, but, in, general, he, was, no, great, orator, his, speeches, were, lengthy, and, verbose, according, to, schwarz, additionally, the, catholic, with, his, palatinate, dialect, a, folksy, man, who, had,

franz, josef, strauss, kohl, was, never, regarded, as, charismatic, or, media, savvy, and, many, of, his, peculiar, coinings, were, heavily, lampooned, and, criticised, nonetheless, many, of, them, have, entered, the, general, lexicon, despite, or, perhaps, because, of, attempts, by, his, opponents, to, mock, them, examples, of, kohlisms, that, have, gained, some, currency, include, his, description, of, the, 1982, change, in, government, as, geistig, moralische, wende, spiritual, and, moral, turnaround, or, the, grace, of, late, birth, gnade, der, sp, ten, geburt, meaning, that, kohl, born, in, 1930, was, only, involved, in, the, war, as, a, flakhelfer, and, escaped, the, possibility, of, involvement, in, nazi, atrocities, by, virtue, of, being, too, young, at, the, time, another, frequently, mocked, turn, of, phrase, by, kohl, was, his, prediction, the, new, states, of, germany, would, soon, turn, into, bl, hende, landschaften, flowering, landscapes, with, some, cynics, pointing, out, that, former, industrial, sites, were, indeed, turning, into, flowering, meadows, in, the, course, of, ecological, succession, as, a, consequence, of, deindustrialisation, kohl, was, a, true, people, s, person, and, loved, to, be, in, company, of, others, his, tremendous, memory, about, people, and, their, lives, helped, him, to, build, up, his, networks, in, the, christian, democratic, union, in, government, and, abroad, in, a, study, of, german, chancellorship, as, political, leadership, henrik, gast, highlights, how, much, time, kohl, invested, in, personal, relationships, even, with, the, backbenchers, in, the, bundestag, and, also, party, officials, up, to, the, local, level, this, worked, because, it, fitted, kohl, s, character, and, was, authentic, kohl, knew, that, all, these, people, were, the, basis, of, his, political, power, and, that, he, needed, their, loyalty, and, personal, affection, he, could, also, be, rude, to, subordinates, and, assistants, and, confront, political, adversaries, he, was, capable, of, both, being, empathetic, and, being, extremely, confrontational, if, you, did, not, do, what, he, wanted, empathy, was, over, as, gast, quotes, a, federal, minister, of, kohl, s, own, party, there, was, also, a, difference, between, the, younger, kohl, and, the, chancellor, in, his, later, years, a, parliamentary, state,
