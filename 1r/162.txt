around, the, world, as, public, works, of, art, moore, also, produced, many, drawings, including, a, series, depicting, londoners, sheltering, from, the, blitz, during, the, second, world, war, along, with, other, graphic, works, on, paper, his, forms, are, usually, abstractions, of, the, human, figure, typically, depicting, mother, and, child, or, reclining, figures, moore, s, works, are, usually, suggestive, of, the, female, body, apart, from, a, phase, in, the, 1950s, when, he, sculpted, family, groups, his, forms, are, generally, pierced, or, contain, hollow, spaces, many, interpreters, liken, the, undulating, form, of, his, reclining, figures, to, the, landscape, and, hills, of, his, yorkshire, birthplace, moore, became, well, known, through, his, carved, marble, and, larger, scale, abstract, cast, bronze, sculptures, and, was, instrumental, in, introducing, a, particular, form, of, modernism, to, the, united, kingdom, his, ability, in, later, life, to, fulfil, large, scale, commissions, made, him, exceptionally, wealthy, despite, this, he, lived, frugally, most, of, the, money, he, earned, went, towards, endowing, the, henry, moore, foundation, which, continues, to, support, education, and, promotion, of, the, arts, moore, was, born, in, castleford, west, riding, of, yorkshire, england, to, mary, n, e, baker, and, raymond, spencer, moore, his, father, was, of, irish, descent, and, became, pit, deputy, responsible, for, safety, and, then, under, manager, of, the, wheldale, colliery, in, castleford, he, was, an, autodidact, with, an, interest, in, music, and, literature, determined, that, his, sons, would, not, work, in, the, mines, he, saw, formal, education, as, the, route, to, their, advancement, henry, was, the, seventh, of, eight, children, in, a, family, that, often, struggled, with, poverty, he, attended, infant, and, elementary, schools, in, castleford, where, he, began, modelling, in, clay, and, carving, in, wood, he, professed, to, have, decided, to, become, a, sculptor, when, he, was, eleven, after, hearing, of, michelangelo, s, achievements, at, a, sunday, school, reading, on, his, second, attempt, he, was, accepted, at, castleford, secondary, school, which, several, of, his, siblings, had, attended, where, his, headmaster, soon, noticed, his, talent, and, interest, in, medieval, sculpture, his, art, teacher, alice, gostick, broadened, his, knowledge, of, art, and, with, her, encouragement, he, determined, to, make, art, his, career, first, by, sitting, for, examinations, for, a, scholarship, to, the, local, art, college, moore, s, earliest, recorded, carvings, a, plaque, for, the, scott, society, at, castleford, secondary, school, and, a, roll, of, honour, commemorating, the, boys, who, went, to, fight, in, the, first, world, war, from, the, school, were, executed, around, this, time, despite, his, early, promise, moore, s, parents, had, been, against, him, training, as, a, sculptor, a, vocation, they, considered, manual, labour, with, few, career, prospects, after, a, brief, introduction, as, a, student, teacher, moore, became, a, teacher, at, the, school, he, had, attended, upon, turning, eighteen, moore, volunteered, for, army, service, in, the, first, world, war, he, was, the, youngest, man, in, the, prince, of, wales, own, civil, service, rifles, regiment, and, was, injured, in, 1917, in, a, gas, attack, on, 30, november, at, bourlon, wood, during, the, battle, of, cambrai, after, recovering, in, hospital, he, saw, out, the, remainder, of, the, war, as, a, physical, training, instructor, only, returning, to, france, as, the, armistice, was, signed, he, recalled, later, for, me, the, war, passed, in, a, romantic, haze, of, trying, to, be, a, hero, this, attitude, changed, as, he, reflected, on, the, destructiveness, of, war, and, in, 1940, he, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, arthur, sale, that, a, year, or, two, after, the, sight, of, a, khaki, uniform, began, to, mean, everything, in, life, that, was, wrong, and, wasteful, and, anti, life, and, i, still, have, that, feeling, after, the, war, moore, received, an, ex, serviceman, s, grant, to, continue, his, education, and, in, 1919, he, became, a, student, at, the, leeds, school, of, art, now, leeds, arts, university, which, set, up, a, sculpture, studio, especially, for, him, at, the, college, he, met, barbara, hepworth, a, fellow, student, who, would, also, become, a, well, known, british, sculptor, and, began, a, friendship, and, gentle, professional, rivalry, that, lasted, for, many, years, in, leeds, moore, also, had, access, to, the, modernist, works, in, the, collection, of, sir, michael, sadler, the, university, vice, chancellor, which, had, a, pronounced, effect, on, his, development, in, 1921, moore, won, a, scholarship, to, study, at, the, royal, college, of, art, in, london, along, with, hepworth, and, other, yorkshire, contemporaries, while, in, london, moore, extended, his, knowledge, of, primitive, art, and, sculpture, studying, the, ethnographic, collections, at, the, british, museum, the, student, sculptures, of, both, moore, and, hepworth, followed, the, standard, romantic, victorian, style, and, included, natural, forms, landscapes, and, figurative, modelling, of, animals, moore, later, became, uncomfortable, with, classically, derived, ideals, his, later, familiarity, with, primitivism, and, the, influence, of, sculptors, such, as, constantin, br, ncu, i, jacob, epstein, henri, gaudier, brzeska, and, frank, dobson, led, him, to, the, method, of, direct, carving, in, which, imperfections, in, the, material, and, marks, left, by, tools, became, part, of, the, finished, sculpture, having, adopted, this, technique, moore, was, in, conflict, with, academic, tutors, who, did, not, appreciate, such, a, modern, approach, during, one, exercise, set, by, derwent, wood, the, professor, of, sculpture, at, the, royal, college, moore, was, asked, to, reproduce, a, marble, relief, of, domenico, rosselli, s, the, virgin, and, child, by, first, modelling, the, relief, in, plaster, then, reproducing, it, in, marble, using, the, mechanical, aid, known, as, a, pointing, machine, a, technique, called, pointing, instead, he, carved, the, relief, directly, even, marking, the, surface, to, simulate, the, prick, marks, that, would, have, been, left, by, the, pointing, machine, in, 1924, moore, won, a, six, month, travelling, scholarship, which, he, spent, in, northern, italy, studying, the, great, works, of, michelangelo, giotto, di, bondone, giovanni, pisano, and, several, other, old, masters, during, this, period, he, also, visited, paris, took, advantage, of, the, timed, sketching, classes, at, the, acad, mie, colarossi, and, viewed, in, the, trocadero, a, plaster, cast, of, a, toltec, maya, sculptural, form, the, chac, mool, which, he, had, previously, seen, in, book, illustrations, the, reclining, figure, was, to, have, a, profound, effect, upon, moore, s, work, becoming, the, primary, motif, of, his, sculpture, on, returning, to, london, moore, undertook, a, seven, year, teaching, post, at, the, royal, college, of, art, he, was, required, to, work, two, days, a, week, which, allowed, him, time, to, spend, on, his, own, work, his, first, public, commission, west, wind, 1928, 29, was, one, of, the, eight, reliefs, of, the, four, winds, high, on, the, walls, of, london, underground, s, headquarters, at, 55, broadway, the, other, winds, were, carved, by, contemporary, sculptors, including, eric, gill, with, the, ground, level, pieces, provided, by, epstein, 1928, saw, moore, s, first, solo, exhibition, held, at, the, warren, gallery, in, london, on, 19, july, 1929, moore, married, irina, radetsky, a, painting, student, at, the, royal, college, irina, was, born, in, kyiv, in, 1907, her, father, was, killed, in, the, russian, revolution, and, her, mother, was, evacuated, to, paris, where, she, married, a, british, army, officer, irina, was, smuggled, to, paris, a, year, later, and, went, to, school, there, until, she, was, 16, after, which, she, was, sent, to, live, with, her, stepfather, s, relatives, in, buckinghamshire, irina, found, security, in, her, marriage, to, moore, and, was, soon, posing, for, him, shortly, after, they, married, the, couple, moved, to, a, studio, in, hampstead, at, 11a, parkhill, road, nw3, joining, a, small, colony, of, avant, garde, artists, who, were, taking, root, there, shortly, afterward, hepworth, and, her, second, husband, ben, nicholson, moved, into, a, studio, around, the, corner, from, moore, while, naum, gabo, roland, penrose, cecil, stephenson, and, the, art, critic, herbert, read, also, lived, in, the, area, read, referred, to, the, area, as, a, nest, of, gentle, artists, the, area, was, also, a, stopping, off, point, for, many, refugee, artists, architects, and, designers, from, continental, europe, en, route, to, america, in, 1932, after, six, years, teaching, at, the, royal, college, moore, took, up, a, post, as, the, head, of, the, department, of, sculpture, at, the, chelsea, school, of, art, artistically, moore, hepworth, and, other, members, of, the, seven, and, five, society, would, develop, steadily, more, abstract, work, partly, influenced, by, their, frequent, trips, to, paris, and, their, contact, with, leading, progressive, artists, notably, pablo, picasso, georges, braque, jean, arp, and, alberto, giacometti, moore, flirted, with, surrealism, joining, paul, nash, s, modern, art, movement, unit, one, in, 1933, in, 1934, moore, visited, spain, he, visited, the, cave, of, altamira, which, he, described, as, the, royal, academy, of, cave, painting, madrid, toledo, and, pamplona, in, 1936, moore, joined, a, group, of, surrealist, artists, founded, by, roland, penrose, and, the, same, year, was, honorary, treasurer, to, the, organising, committee, of, the, london, international, surrealist, exhibition, in, 1937, roland, penrose, purchased, an, abstract, mother, and, child, in, stone, from, moore, that, he, displayed, in, the, front, garden, of, his, house, in, hampstead, the, work, proved, controversial, with, other, residents, and, the, local, press, ran, a, campaign, against, the, piece, over, the, next, two, years, at, this, time, moore, gradually, transitioned, from, direct, carving, to, casting, in, bronze, modelling, preliminary, maquettes, in, clay, or, plaster, rather, than, making, preparatory, drawings, in, 1938, moore, met, kenneth, clark, for, the, first, time, from, this, time, clark, became, an, unlikely, but, influential, champion, of, moore, s, work, and, through, his, position, as, member, of, the, arts, council, of, great, britain, he, secured, exhibitions, and, commissions, for, the, artist, at, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, the, chelsea, school, of, art, was, evacuated, to, northampton, and, moore, resigned, his, teaching, post, during, the, war, moore, produced, powerful, drawings, of, londoners, sleeping, in, the, london, underground, while, sheltering, from, the, blitz, kenneth, clark, the, chairman, of, the, war, artists, advisory, committee, waac, had, previously, tried, to, recruit, moore, as, a, full, time, salaried, war, artist, and, now, agreed, to, purchase, some, of, the, shelter, drawings, and, issued, contracts, for, further, examples, the, shelter, drawings, waac, acquired, were, completed, between, the, autumn, of, 1940, and, the, spring, of, 1941, and, are, regarded, as, among, the, finest, products, of, the, waac, scheme, in, august, 1941, waac, commissioned, moore, to, draw, miners, working, underground, at, the, wheldale, colliery, in, yorkshire, where, his, father, had, worked, at, the, start, of, the, century, moore, drew, the, people, in, the, shelters, as, passively, waiting, the, all, clear, while, miners, aggressively, worked, the, coal, faces, it, has, been, suggested, that, moore, s, wartime, drawings, of, the, underground, and, coalmines, were, inspired, in, part, by, gustave, dor, s, illustrations, for, dante, s, divine, comedy, moore, s, drawings, helped, to, boost, his, international, reputation, particularly, in, america, where, examples, were, included, in, the, waac, britain, at, war, exhibition, which, toured, north, america, throughout, the, war, after, their, hampstead, home, was, hit, by, bomb, shrapnel, in, september, 1940, moore, and, irina, moved, out, of, london, to, live, in, a, farmhouse, called, hoglands, in, the, hamlet, of, perry, green, near, much, hadham, hertfordshire, this, was, to, become, moore, s, home, and, workshop, for, the, rest, of, his, life, despite, acquiring, significant, wealth, later, in, life, moore, never, felt, the, need, to, move, to, larger, premises, and, apart, from, the, addition, of, a, number, of, outbuildings, and, studios, the, house, changed, little, over, the, years, in, 1943, he, received, a, commission, from, st, matthew, s, church, northampton, to, carve, a, madonna, and, child, this, sculpture, was, the, first, in, an, important, series, of, family, group, sculptures, after, the, war, and, following, several, earlier, miscarriages, irina, gave, birth, to, their, daughter, mary, moore, in, march, 1946, the, child, was, named, after, moore, s, mother, who, had, died, two, years, earlier, both, the, loss, of, his, mother, and, the, arrival, of, a, baby, focused, moore, s, mind, on, the, family, which, he, expressed, in, his, work, by, producing, many, mother, and, child, compositions, although, reclining, and, internal, external, figures, also, remained, popular, in, the, same, year, moore, made, his, first, visit, to, america, when, a, retrospective, exhibition, of, his, work, opened, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, before, the, war, moore, had, been, approached, by, educator, henry, morris, who, was, trying, to, reform, education, with, his, concept, of, the, village, college, morris, had, engaged, walter, gropius, as, the, architect, for, his, second, village, college, at, impington, near, cambridge, and, he, wanted, moore, to, design, a, major, public, sculpture, for, the, site, the, county, council, however, could, not, afford, gropius, s, full, design, and, scaled, back, the, project, when, gropius, emigrated, to, america, lacking, funds, morris, had, to, cancel, moore, s, sculpture, which, had, not, progressed, beyond, the, maquette, stage, moore, was, able, to, reuse, the, design, in, 1950, for, a, similar, commission, outside, a, secondary, school, for, the, new, town, of, stevenage, this, time, the, project, was, completed, and, family, group, became, moore, s, first, large, scale, public, bronze, in, the, 1950s, moore, began, to, receive, increasingly, significant, commissions, he, exhibited, reclining, figure, festival, at, the, festival, of, britain, in, 1951, and, in, 1958, produced, a, large, marble, reclining, figure, for, the, unesco, building, in, paris, with, many, more, public, works, of, art, the, scale, of, moore, s, sculptures, grew, significantly, and, he, started, to, employ, an, increasing, number, of, assistants, to, work, with, him, at, much, hadham, including, anthony, caro, roland, pich, and, richard, wentworth, on, the, campus, of, the, university, of, chicago, in, december, 1967, 25, years, to, the, minute, after, the, team, of, physicists, led, by, enrico, fermi, achieved, the, first, controlled, self, sustaining, nuclear, chain, reaction, moore, s, nuclear, energy, was, unveiled, on, the, site, of, what, was, once, the, university, s, football, field, stands, in, the, rackets, court, beneath, which, the, experiments, had, taken, place, this, 12, foot, tall, piece, in, the, middle, of, a, large, open, plaza, is, often, thought, to, represent, a, mushroom, cloud, topped, by, a, massive, human, skull, but, moore, s, interpretation, was, very, different, he, once, told, a, friend, that, he, hoped, viewers, would, go, around, it, looking, out, through, the, open, spaces, and, that, they, may, have, a, feeling, of, being, in, a, cathedral, in, chicago, illinois, moore, also, commemorated, science, with, a, large, bronze, sundial, locally, named, man, enters, the, cosmos, 1980, which, was, commissioned, to, recognise, the, space, exploration, program, the, last, three, decades, of, moore, s, life, continued, in, a, similar, vein, several, major, retrospectives, took, place, around, the, world, notably, a, very, prominent, exhibition, in, the, summer, of, 1972, in, the, grounds, of, the, forte, di, belvedere, overlooking, florence, following, the, pioneering, documentary, henry, moore, produced, by, john, read, in, 1951, he, appeared, in, many, films, in, 1964, for, instance, moore, was, featured, in, the, documentary, 5, british, sculptors, work, and, talk, by, american, filmmaker, warren, forma, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, there, were, some, 40, exhibitions, a, year, featuring, his, work, the, number, of, commissions, continued, to, increase, he, completed, knife, edge, two, piece, in, 1962, for, college, green, near, the, houses, of, parliament, in, london, according, to, moore, when, i, was, offered, the, site, near, the, house, of, lords, i, liked, the, place, so, much, that, i, didn, t, bother, to, go, and, see, an, alternative, site, in, hyde, park, one, lonely, sculpture, can, be, lost, in, a, large, park, the, house, of, lords, site, is, quite, different, it, is, next, to, a, path, where, people, walk, and, it, has, a, few, seats, where, they, can, sit, and, contemplate, it, as, his, wealth, grew, moore, began, to, worry, about, his, legacy, with, the, help, of, his, daughter, mary, he, set, up, the, henry, moore, trust, in, 1972, with, a, view, to, protecting, his, estate, from, death, duties, by, 1977, he, was, paying, close, to, a, million, pounds, a, year, in, income, tax, to, mitigate, his, tax, burden, he, established, the, henry, moore, foundation, as, a, registered, charity, with, irina, and, mary, as, trustees, the, foundation, was, established, to, encourage, the, public, appreciation, of, the, visual, arts, and, especially, the, works, of, moore, it, now, runs, his, house, and, estate, at, perry, green, with, a, gallery, sculpture, park, and, studios, in, 1979, henry, moore, became, unexpectedly, known, in, germany, when, his, sculpture, large, two, forms, was, installed, in, the, forecourt, of, the, german, chancellery, in, bonn, which, was, the, capital, city, of, west, germany, prior, to, german, reunification, in, october, 1990, moore, died, on, 31, august, 1986, at, his, home, in, perry, green, his, body, was, interred, at, the, churchyard, of, st, thomas, s, church, moore, s, signature, form, is, a, reclining, figure, moore, s, exploration, of, this, form, under, the, influence, of, the, toltec, mayan, figure, he, had, seen, at, the, louvre, was, to, lead, him, to, increasing, abstraction, as, he, turned, his, thoughts, towards, experimentation, with, the, elements, of, design, moore, s, earlier, reclining, figures, deal, principally, with, mass, while, his, later, ones, contrast, the, solid, elements, of, the, sculpture, with, the, space, not, only, round, them, but, generally, through, them, as, he, pierced, the, forms, with, openings, earlier, figures, are, pierced, in, a, conventional, manner, in, which, bent, limbs, separate, from, and, rejoin, the, body, the, later, more, abstract, figures, are, often, penetrated, by, spaces, directly, through, the, body, by, which, means, moore, explores, and, alternates, concave, and, convex, shapes, these, more, extreme, piercings, developed, in, parallel, with, barbara, hepworth, s, sculptures, hepworth, first, pierced, a, torso, after, misreading, a, review, of, one, of, henry, moore, s, early, shows, the, plaster, reclining, figure, festival, 1951, in, the, tate, is, characteristic, of, moore, s, later, sculptures, an, abstract, female, figure, intercut, with, voids, as, with, much, of, the, post, war, work, there, are, several, bronze, casts, of, this, sculpture, when, moore, s, niece, asked, why, his, sculptures, had, such, simple, titles, he, replied, all, art, should, have, a, certain, mystery, and, should, make, demands, on, the, spectator, giving, a, sculpture, or, a, drawing, too, explicit, a, title, takes, away, part, of, that, mystery, so, that, the, spectator, moves, on, to, the, next, object, making, no, effort, to, ponder, the, meaning, of, what, he, has, just, seen, everyone, thinks, that, he, or, she, looks, but, they, don, t, really, you, know, moore, s, early, work, is, focused, on, direct, carving, in, which, the, form, of, the, sculpture, evolves, as, the, artist, repeatedly, whittles, away, at, the, block, in, the, 1930s, moore, s, transition, into, modernism, paralleled, that, of, barbara, hepworth, the, two, exchanged, new, ideas, with, each, other, and, several, other, artists, then, living, in, hampstead, moore, made, many, preparatory, sketches, and, drawings, for, each, sculpture, most, of, these, sketchbooks, have, survived, and, provide, insight, into, moore, s, development, he, placed, great, importance, on, drawing, in, old, age, when, he, had, arthritis, he, continued, to, draw, after, the, second, world, war, moore, s, bronzes, took, on, their, larger, scale, which, was, particularly, suited, for, public, art, commissions, as, a, matter, of, practicality, he, largely, abandoned, direct, carving, and, took, on, several, assistants, to, help, produce, the, larger, forms, based, on, maquettes, by, the, end, of, the, 1940s, he, produced, sculptures, increasingly, by, modelling, working, out, the, shape, in, clay, or, plaster, before, casting, the, final, work, in, bronze, using, the, lost, wax, technique, these, maquettes, often, began, as, small, forms, shaped, by, moore, s, hands, a, process, that, gives, his, work, an, organic, feeling, they, are, from, the, body, at, his, home, in, much, hadham, moore, built, up, a, collection, of, natural, objects, skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks, and, shells, which, he, would, use, to, provide, inspiration, for, organic, forms, for, his, largest, works, he, usually, produced, a, half, scale, working, model, before, scaling, up, for, the, final, moulding, and, casting, at, a, bronze, foundry, moore, often, refined, the, final, full, plaster, shape, and, added, surface, marks, before, casting, moore, produced, at, least, three, significant, examples, of, architectural, sculpture, during, his, career, in, 1928, despite, his, own, self, described, extreme, reservations, he, accepted, his, first, public, commission, for, west, wind, for, the, london, underground, building, at, 55, broadway, in, london, joining, the, company, of, jacob, epstein, and, eric, gill, in, 1953, he, completed, a, four, part, screen, carved, in, portland, stone, for, the, time, life, building, in, new, bond, street, london, and, in, 1955, moore, turned, to, his, first, and, only, work, in, carved, brick, wall, relief, at, the, bouwcentrum, in, rotterdam, the, brick, relief, was, sculpted, with, 16, 000, bricks, by, two, dutch, bricklayers, under, moore, s, supervision, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, the, holocaust, and, the, age, of, the, atomic, bomb, instilled, in, the, sculpture, of, the, mid, 1940s, a, sense, that, art, should, return, to, its, pre, cultural, and, pre, rational, origins, in, the, literature, of, the, day, writers, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, advocated, a, similar, reductive, philosophy, at, an, introductory, speech, in, new, york, city, for, an, exhibition, of, one, of, the, finest, modernist, sculptors, alberto, giacometti, sartre, spoke, of, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, history, moore, s, sense, of, england, emerging, undefeated, from, siege, led, to, his, focus, on, pieces, characterised, by, endurance, and, continuity, most, sculptors, who, emerged, during, the, height, of, moore, s, fame, and, in, the, aftermath, of, his, death, found, themselves, cast, in, his, shadow, by, the, late, 1940s, moore, was, a, worldwide, celebrity, he, was, the, voice, of, british, sculpture, and, of, british, modernism, in, general, the, next, generation, was, constantly, compared, against, him, and, reacted, by, challenging, his, legacy, his, establishment, credentials, and, his, position, at, the, 1952, venice, biennale, eight, new, british, sculptors, produced, their, geometry, of, fear, works, as, a, direct, contrast, to, the, ideals, behind, moore, s, idea, of, endurance, continuity, his, large, bronze, double, standing, figure, stood, outside, the, british, pavilion, and, contrasted, strongly, with, the, rougher, and, more, angular, works, inside, yet, moore, had, a, direct, influence, on, several, generations, of, sculptors, of, both, british, and, international, reputation, among, the, artists, who, have, acknowledged, moore, s, importance, to, their, work, are, sir, anthony, caro, phillip, king, and, isaac,
