for, koreans, and, park, s, grades, were, plummeting, in, 1935, he, was, ranked, last, among, the, 73, students, in, his, class, and, missed, more, days, of, school, each, year, park, s, teachers, attributed, this, to, his, dire, economic, situation, lee, theorizes, that, the, absences, were, caused, by, his, parents, inability, to, gather, enough, money, for, his, expenses, at, the, school, in, time, which, caused, him, to, miss, the, first, several, weeks, of, each, term, in, addition, park, s, older, brother, sang, hee, lost, his, job, and, two, children, to, disease, in, 1935, making,

was, being, sent, home, to, collect, money, for, his, living, expenses, despite, knowing, that, his, family, would, not, have, it, lee, speculates, that, park, became, more, pragmatic, and, calculating, during, this, time, as, they, were, traits, that, were, needed, for, not, only, staying, enrolled, but, also, to, avoid, starving, in, 1934, park, began, secretly, dating, yi, ch, ng, ok, who, was, attending, a, girls, school, in, the, same, city, park, s, father, wished, to, see, park, married, as, soon, as, possible, and, not, knowing, about, his, son, s, relationship, arranged, a, marriage, to, a, different, woman, kim, ho, nam, the, two, married, in, 1935, while, park, was, still, in, love, with, yi, while, the, marriage, produced, a, daughter, park, jae, ok, kim, was, reportedly, appalled, at, the, family, s, poverty, and, the, couple, avoided, each, other, as, much, as, possible, after, their, marriage, park, had, a, year, left, to, go, at, school, so, he, left, her, at, the, park, household, and, returned, on, march, 20, 1937, park, graduated, from, taegu, ranked, 69, out, of, 70, in, his, class, as, part, of, the, conditions, of, his, schooling, he, was,

began, receiving, a, comfortable, salary, which, he, sent, part, of, to, his, family, but, just, as, he, had, once, done, his, students, walked, to, the, school, daily, often, from, far, away, and, struggled, to, afford, meals, he, offered, assistance, to, several, of, them, in, order, to, have, them, keep, coming, to, the, school, while, park, was, remembered, by, his, students, as, a, caring, and, enthusiastic, teacher, lee, speculates, that, in, such, a, small, town, park, was, lonely, and, understimulated, he, and, his, roommate, reportedly, drank, large, amounts, of, makgeolli, korean, rice, wine, to, pass, the, time, shortly, after, park, began, teaching, japan, launched, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, began, making, significant, victories, in, quick, succession, park, was, inspired, by, the, success, of, the, japanese, he, even, wrote, a, stageplay, that, his, students, acted, out, entitled, volunteer, soldiers, go, to, war, the, play, reflected, contemporary, events, as, around, february, 1938, the, colonial, government, had, instituted, the, special, volunteer, enlistment, system, thousands, of, korean, youths, applied, although, whether, most, applied, willingly, or, even, just, for, the, salary, and, benefits, is, a, subject, of, academic, debate, however, the, japanese, military, was, wary, of, accepting, koreans, due, to, concerns, over, their, loyalty, and, thus, only, accepted, a, fraction, of, the, applicants, each, year, if, a, korean, could, demonstrate, unshakable, patriotism, they, were, considered, to, have, a, better, chance, of, being, accepted, in, 1938, park, applied, to, join, the, manchukuo, army, military, academy, which, was, to, open, the, following, year, however, he, was, three, years, over, the, maximum, age, limit, of, 19, for, candidates, he, wrote, a, request, for, the, admissions, office, to, overlook, his, age, but, was, rejected, park, sought, out, kang, chae, ho, an, ethnic, korean, captain, in, the, manchukuo, army, and, a, native, of, daegu, for, advice, kang, offered, to, use, his, connections, to, try, and, get, an, exception, for, park, he, also, advised, park, to, swear, a, blood, oath, hy, ls, in, order, to, demonstrate, his, fealty, to, japan, and, draw, publicity, for, his, cause, park, did, so, on, march, 31, 1939, the, manchukuo, newspaper, mansh, shimbun, ran, an, article, called, blood, oath, desire, to, be, an, army, officer, young, teacher, from, the, peninsula, on, the, 29th, admissions, officers, of, the, military, government, command, were, deeply, moved, by, a, piece, of, registered, mail, from, park, chung, hee, a, teacher, at, western, mungyeong, public, school, in, north, gyeongsang, province, korea, included, in, the, mail, was, a, passionate, letter, that, expressed, park, s, desire, to, be, an, army, officer, as, well, as, an, oath, written, in, blood, that, read, service, until, death, becoming, an, officer, however, is, limited, to, those, already, in, the, army, being, 23, years, old, he, exceeded, the, age, limit, of, 19, therefore, and, regretfully, his, application, was, politely, rejected, in, spite, of, this, second, rejection, park, was, somehow, eventually, accepted, to, the, academy, the, circumstances, surrounding, his, acceptance, are, not, known, with, certainty, and, are, a, source, of, controversy, the, leading, theory, is, that, arikawa, then, a, colonel, in, the, kwantung, army, personally, asked, the, commandant, of, the, academy, major, general, nagumo, to, let, park, in, another, theory, proposed, by, the, korean, chinese, historian, ryu, y, n, san, in, 2003, posits, that, park, may, have, joined, the, gando, special, force, as, another, show, of, fealty, the, unit, was, meant, to, suppress, korean, independence, activism, in, the, jiandao, region, gando, in, korean, kant, in, japanese, of, northeast, china, however, this, theory, is, rejected, by, biographers, cho, gab, je, and, chong, sik, lee, who, argue, that, the, testimony, that, the, theory, is, based, on, does, not, align, with, the, chronology, of, widely, accepted, events, in, park, s, life, the, schooling, environment, at, the, manchukuo, academy, was, tense, in, part, due, to, its, significant, ethnic, linguistic, and, political, diversity, its, student, body, was, composed, of, around, 10, korean, 223, chinese, and, 107, japanese, people, according, to, chong, sik, lee, park, excelled, at, the, academy, especially, in, comparison, to, the, non, japanese, students, he, was, fluent, in, japanese, comparatively, well, educated, and, already, accustomed, to, military, drills, and, regimented, dormitory, life, from, his, time, at, taegu, normal, school, he, adopted, and, went, by, the, japanese, name, takagi, masao, park, was, made, to, assist, other, students, several, of, his, chinese, and, korean, classmates, later, described, him, as, arrogant, and, recalled, that, other, students, picked, fights, with, him, in, spite, of, this, according, to, lee, park, remembered, his, time, at, the, academy, fondly, at, a, state, dinner, in, tokyo, in, november, 1961, park, made, a, point, to, find, and, thank, general, nagumo, shinichir, the, former, commandant, of, the, academy, for, his, time, there, nagumo, revealed, that, park, had, been, sending, him, gifts, of, ginseng, at, the, time, manchukuo, was, seen, as, a, haven, for, japanese, political, extremists, of, both, the, left, and, right, and, the, academy, similarly, had, instructors, who, were, then, and, later, associated, with, significant, controversy, according, to, one, account, a, captain, kanno, hiroshi, had, previously, partaken, in, the, failed, february, 26, incident, coup, in, japan, and, taught, an, analysis, of, the, coup, that, park, possibly, heeded, lee, evaluated, this, account, as, convincing, and, theorized, that, years, later, park, applied, the, lessons, to, his, own, coup, in, march, 1942, park, graduated, among, the, top, five, students, of, the, academy, after, graduation, he, took, a, three, month, apprenticeship, in, the, kwantung, army, s, 30th, infantry, regiment, in, harbin, as, a, liaison, his,

was, we, can, do, anything, if, we, try, as, park, argued, that, all, problems, could, be, overcome, by, sheer, willpower, eckert, wrote, when, interviewing, park, s, closest, friends, he, always, received, the, same, answer, when, he, asked, them, what, was, the, important, influence, on, park, namely, his, officer, training, by, the, japanese, in, manchukuo, all, of, park, s, friends, told, eckert, that, to, understand, him, one, needed, to, understand, his, ilbonsik, sagwan, kyoyuk, japanese, officer, training, as, they, all, maintained, park, s, values, were, those, of, an, imperial,
