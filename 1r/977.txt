ali, ibn, abi, talib, arabic, romanized, al, ibn, ab, lib, c, 600, 661, ce, was, the, cousin, and, son, in, law, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, was, the, fourth, rashidun, caliph, who, ruled, from, 656, ce, to, 661, as, well, as, the, first, shia, imam, born, to, abu, talib, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, and, fatima, bint, asad, young, ali, was, raised, by, his, elder, cousin, muhammad, and, was, among, the, first, to, accept, his, teachings, ali, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, early, years, of, islam, when, muslims, were, severely, persecuted, in, mecca, after, immigration, hijra, to, medina, in, 622, muhammad, gave, his, daughter, fatima, to, ali, in, marriage, and, swore, a, pact, of, brotherhood, with, him, ali, served, as, muhammad, s, secretary, and, deputy, in, this, period, and, was, the, flag, bearer, of, his, army, numerous, sayings, of, muhammad, praise, ali, the, most, controversial, of, which, was, uttered, in, 632, at, the, ghadir, khumm, whoever, i, am, his, mawla, this, ali, is, his, mawla, the, interpretation, of, the, polysemous, arabic, word, mawla, is, disputed, for, shia, muslims, muhammad, thus, invested, ali, with, his, religious, and, political, authority, while, sunni, muslims, view, this, as, a, mere, statement, of, friendship, and, rapport, when, muhammad, died, in, the, same, year, a, group, of, muslims, met, in, the, absence, of, ali, and, appointed, abu, bakr, r, 632, 634, as, their, leader, ali, later, relinquished, his, claims, to, leadership, and, resigned, from, public, life, during, the, reigns, of, abu, bakr, and, his, successor, umar, r, 634, 644, even, though, his, advice, was, occasionally, sought, the, conflicts, between, ali, and, the, first, two, caliphs, are, epitomized, by, his, refusal, to, follow, their, practices, this, refusal, cost, ali, the, caliphate, to, the, benefit, of, uthman, r, 644, 656, who, was, thus, appointed, to, succeed, umar, by, the, electoral, council, ali, was, also, highly, critical, of, uthman, who, was, widely, accused, of, nepotism, and, corruption, yet, ali, also, repeatedly, mediated, between, the, caliph, and, the, provincial, dissidents, angered, by, his, policies, following, uthman, s, assassination, in, june, 656, ali, was, elected, caliph, in, medina, he, immediately, faced, two, separate, rebellions, both, ostensibly, to, avenge, uthman, the, triumvirate, of, talha, zubayr, both, companions, of, muhammad, and, his, widow, aisha, captured, basra, in, iraq, but, were, defeated, by, ali, in, the, battle, of, the, camel, in, 656, elsewhere, mu, awiya, whom, ali, had, just, removed, from, the, governorship, of, syria, fought, against, ali, the, inconclusive, battle, of, siffin, in, 657, which, ended, in, a, failed, arbitration, process, that, alienated, some, of, ali, s, supporters, these, formed, the, kharijites, who, later, terrorized, the, public, and, were, crushed, by, ali, in, the, battle, of, nahrawan, in, 658, ali, was, assassinated, in, 661, by, the, kharijite, dissident, ibn, muljam, which, paved, the, way, for, mu, awiya, to, seize, power, and, found, the, dynastic, umayyad, caliphate, ali, is, revered, for, his, courage, honesty, unbending, devotion, to, islam, magnanimity, and, equal, treatment, of, all, muslims, for, his, admirers, he, has, thus, become, the, archetype, of, uncorrupted, islam, and, pre, islamic, chivalry, sunni, muslims, regard, him, as, the, last, of, the, rashidun, lit, rightly, guided, caliphs, while, shia, muslims, venerate, him, as, their, first, imam, that, is, the, rightful, religious, and, political, successor, to, muhammad, ali, s, place, is, said, to, be, second, only, to, muhammad, in, shia, muslim, culture, the, shrine, of, ali, in, najaf, iraq, is, a, major, destination, for, shia, pilgrimage, the, legacy, of, ali, is, collected, and, studied, in, numerous, books, the, most, famous, of, which, is, nahj, al, balagha, ali, was, born, in, mecca, to, abu, talib, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, and, his, wife, fatima, bint, asad, around, 600, ce, his, date, of, birth, is, possibly, 13, rajab, which, is, the, occasion, celebrated, annually, by, shia, muslims, ali, may, have, been, the, only, person, born, inside, the, ka, ba, the, holiest, site, of, islam, which, is, located, in, mecca, however, this, is, disputed, by, sunni, sources, which, state, hakim, ibn, hizam, was, also, born, in, the, ka, ba, furthermore, sunni, scholar, al, nawawi, regards, the, birth, of, ali, in, the, ka, ba, as, weak, ali, s, father, was, a, leading, member, of, the, banu, hashim, a, clan, within, the, meccan, tribe, of, quraysh, abu, talib, also, raised, his, nephew, muhammad, after, his, parents, died, later, when, abu, talib, fell, into, poverty, ali, was, taken, in, at, the, age, of, about, five, and, raised, by, muhammad, and, his, wife, khadija, aged, about, eleven, ali, was, among, the, first, to, accept, muhammad, s, teachings, and, profess, islam, ali, did, so, either, after, khadija, or, after, khadija, and, muhammad, s, successor, abu, bakr, while, the, precise, order, here, is, debated, among, shia, and, sunni, scholars, the, earliest, sources, place, ali, before, abu, bakr, muhammad, s, call, to, islam, in, mecca, lasted, from, 610, to, 622, during, which, ali, assiduously, supported, the, small, muslim, community, especially, the, poor, some, three, years, after, his, first, revelation, muhammad, gathered, his, relatives, for, a, feast, invited, them, to, islam, and, asked, for, their, assistance, aged, about, fourteen, ali, was, the, only, relative, there, who, offered, his, support, after, which, muhammad, told, his, guests, that, ali, was, his, brother, and, his, successor, according, to, the, sunni, historian, al, tabari, d, 923, the, shia, interpretation, of, this, episode, is, that, muhammad, had, already, designated, ali, as, his, successor, when, tipped, off, about, an, assassination, plot, in, 622, muhammad, escaped, to, yathrib, now, known, as, medina, but, ali, stayed, behind, as, his, decoy, that, ali, risked, his, life, for, muhammad, is, said, to, be, the, reason, for, the, revelation, of, the, quranic, passage, but, there, is, also, a, kind, of, man, who, gives, his, life, away, to, please, god, this, emigration, marks, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, calendar, ah, ali, too, escaped, mecca, after, returning, the, goods, entrusted, to, muhammad, there, later, in, medina, muhammad, selected, ali, as, his, brother, when, he, paired, muslims, for, fraternity, pacts, around, 623, 625, muhammad, gave, his, daughter, fatima, to, ali, in, marriage, aged, about, twenty, two, at, the, time, muhammad, had, earlier, turned, down, marriage, proposals, for, fatima, by, some, of, his, companions, notably, abu, bakr, and, umar, a, christian, envoy, from, najran, located, in, south, arabia, arrived, in, medina, circa, 632, and, negotiated, a, peace, treaty, with, muhammad, the, envoy, also, debated, with, muhammad, the, nature, of, jesus, human, or, divine, linked, to, this, episode, is, verse, 3, 61, of, the, quran, which, instructs, muhammad, to, challenge, his, opponents, to, mubahala, lit, mutual, cursing, perhaps, when, their, debate, had, reached, a, deadlock, even, though, the, delegation, ultimately, withdrew, from, the, challenge, muhammad, appeared, for, the, occasion, of, mubahala, accompanied, by, ali, his, wife, fatima, and, their, two, sons, hasan, and, husayn, the, inclusion, of, these, four, by, muhammad, in, the, mubahala, ritual, as, his, witnesses, and, guarantors, likely, raised, their, religious, rank, within, the, community, if, the, word, ourselves, in, the, verse, is, a, reference, to, ali, and, muhammad, as, shia, authors, argue, then, the, former, naturally, enjoys, a, similar, religious, authority, in, the, quran, as, the, latter, in, medina, ali, acted, as, muhammad, s, secretary, and, deputy, he, was, also, one, of, the, scribes, tasked, with, committing, the, quran, to, writing, in, 628, ali, wrote, down, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, al, hudaybiya, the, peace, treaty, between, muslims, and, meccan, pagans, in, 630, divine, orders, pushed, muhammad, to, replace, abu, bakr, with, ali, for, a, key, quranic, announcement, in, mecca, according, to, the, canonical, sunni, source, sunan, al, nasa, i, ali, also, helped, ensure, that, the, conquest, of, mecca, in, 630, was, bloodless, and, later, destroyed, the, idols, housed, in, ka, ba, in, 631, ali, was, sent, to, preach, islam, in, yemen, as, a, consequence, of, which, the, hamdanids, peacefully, converted, ali, also, peacefully, resolved, a, blood, feud, between, muslims, and, the, banu, jadhima, ali, accompanied, muhammad, in, all, of, his, military, missions, except, the, expedition, of, tabuk, in, 630, during, which, ali, was, left, behind, in, charge, of, medina, the, hadith, of, the, position, is, linked, to, this, occasion, are, you, not, content, ali, to, stand, to, me, as, aaron, stood, to, moses, except, that, there, will, be, no, prophet, after, me, this, statement, appears, in, the, canonical, sunni, sources, sahih, al, bukhari, and, sahih, muslim, among, others, for, the, shia, this, hadith, signifies, ali, s, usurped, right, to, succeed, muhammad, in, the, absence, of, muhammad, ali, commanded, the, expedition, to, fadak, in, 628, ali, was, renowned, for, his, bravery, on, the, battlefield, and, for, his, magnanimity, towards, his, defeated, enemies, he, was, the, standard, bearer, in, the, battle, of, badr, 624, and, the, battle, of, khaybar, 628, he, vigorously, defended, muhammad, in, the, battle, of, uhud, 625, and, the, battle, of, hunayn, 630, and, muslims, victory, in, the, battle, of, khaybar, has, been, attributed, to, his, courage, where, he, is, said, to, have, torn, off, the, iron, gate, of, the, enemy, fort, ali, also, defeated, the, pagan, champion, amr, ibn, abd, wudd, in, the, battle, of, the, trench, in, 627, according, to, al, tabari, muhammad, reported, hearing, a, divine, voice, at, uhud, no, sword, but, zulfiqar, no, chivalrous, youth, fata, but, ali, ali, and, another, companion, zubayr, apparently, oversaw, the, killing, of, the, banu, qurayza, men, for, treachery, in, 626, 627, though, the, historicity, of, this, account, has, been, doubted, on, his, return, trip, from, the, hajj, pilgrimage, in, 632, muhammad, halted, the, large, caravan, of, pilgrims, at, the, ghadir, khumm, and, addressed, them, after, the, congregational, prayer, after, the, prayer, muhammad, delivered, a, sermon, to, a, large, number, of, muslims, in, which, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, quran, and, his, ahl, al, bayt, lit, people, of, the, house, his, family, taking, ali, by, the, hand, muhammad, then, asked, if, he, was, not, awla, lit, have, more, authority, over, or, closer, to, the, believers, than, themselves, this, is, evidently, a, reference, to, verse, 33, 6, of, the, quran, when, they, affirmed, muhammad, then, declared, he, whose, mawla, i, am, ali, is, his, mawla, musnad, ibn, hanbal, a, canonical, sunni, source, adds, that, muhammad, repeated, this, statement, three, or, four, more, times, and, that, umar, congratulated, ali, after, the, sermon, you, have, now, become, the, mawla, of, every, faithful, man, and, woman, muhammad, had, earlier, alerted, muslims, about, his, impending, death, shia, sources, describe, the, event, in, greater, detail, linking, the, announcement, to, verses, 5, 3, and, 5, 67, of, the, quran, the, authenticity, of, the, ghadir, khumm, is, rarely, contested, as, its, among, the, most, extensively, acknowledged, and, substantiated, reports, in, classical, islamic, sources, however, mawla, is, a, polysemous, arabic, word, and, its, interpretation, in, the, context, of, the, ghadir, khumm, is, split, along, sectarian, lines, shia, sources, interpret, mawla, as, leader, master, and, patron, while, sunni, sources, interpret, it, as, love, or, support, for, ali, shias, therefore, view, the, ghadir, khumm, as, the, investiture, of, ali, with, muhammad, s, religious, and, political, authority, while, sunnis, regard, it, as, a, statement, about, the, rapport, between, the, two, men, or, that, ali, should, execute, muhammad, s, will, shias, point, to, the, extraordinary, nature, of, the, announcement, give, quranic, and, textual, evidence, and, argue, to, eliminate, other, meanings, of, mawla, in, the, hadith, except, for, authority, while, sunnis, minimize, the, importance, of, the, ghadir, khumm, by, casting, it, as, a, simple, response, to, earlier, complaints, about, ali, during, his, caliphate, ali, is, known, to, have, asked, muslims, to, come, forward, with, their, testimonies, about, the, ghadir, khumm, presumably, to, counter, challenges, to, his, legitimacy, muhammad, died, in, 632, when, ali, was, in, his, early, thirties, as, he, and, other, close, relatives, prepared, for, the, burial, a, group, of, the, ansar, medinan, natives, lit, helpers, gathered, at, the, saqifa, to, discuss, the, future, of, muslims, or, to, retake, control, of, their, city, medina, abu, bakr, and, umar, were, among, the, few, representatives, of, the, muhajirun, meccan, converts, lit, migrants, at, the, saqifa, the, case, of, ali, was, unsuccessfully, brought, up, at, the, saqifa, in, his, absence, and, ultimately, those, present, there, appointed, abu, bakr, to, leadership, after, a, heated, debate, that, is, said, to, have, become, violent, clan, rivalries, at, the, saqifa, played, a, key, role, in, favor, of, abu, bakr, and, the, outcome, may, have, been, different, in, a, broad, council, shura, with, ali, as, a, candidate, in, particular, the, quraysh, tradition, of, hereditary, succession, strongly, favored, ali, even, though, his, youth, weakened, his, case, by, contrast, the, succession, caliphate, of, abu, bakr, is, often, justified, on, the, basis, that, he, led, some, of, the, prayers, in, muhammad, s, final, days, but, the, veracity, and, political, significance, of, such, reports, have, been, questioned, while, the, appointment, of, abu, bakr, was, met, with, little, resistance, in, medina, the, banu, hashim, and, some, companions, of, muhammad, soon, gathered, in, protest, at, ali, s, house, among, them, were, zubayr, and, muhammad, s, uncle, abbas, these, protestors, held, ali, to, be, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, probably, in, reference, to, the, ghadir, khumm, among, others, al, tabari, reports, that, umar, then, led, an, armed, mob, to, ali, s, residence, and, threatened, to, set, the, house, on, fire, if, ali, and, his, supporters, did, not, pledge, their, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, the, scene, soon, grew, violent, but, the, mob, retreated, after, ali, s, wife, fatima, pleaded, with, them, abu, bakr, later, placed, a, successful, boycott, on, the, banu, hashim, who, eventually, abandoned, their, support, for, ali, most, likely, ali, himself, did, not, pledge, his, allegiance, to, abu, bakr, until, fatima, died, within, six, months, of, her, father, muhammad, in, shia, sources, the, death, and, miscarriage, of, the, young, fatima, are, attributed, to, an, attack, on, her, house, to, subdue, ali, by, the, order, of, abu, bakr, sunnis, categorically, reject, these, reports, but, there, is, evidence, in, their, early, sources, that, a, mob, entered, fatima, s, house, by, force, and, arrested, ali, an, incident, that, abu, bakr, regretted, on, his, deathbed, likely, a, political, move, to, weaken, the, banu, hashim, abu, bakr, had, earlier, confiscated, from, fatima, the, rich, lands, of, fadak, which, she, considered, her, inheritance, or, a, gift, from, her, father, the, confiscation, of, fadak, is, often, justified, in, sunni, sources, with, a, hadith, about, prophetic, inheritance, the, authenticity, of, which, has, been, doubted, partly, because, it, contradicts, quranic, injunctions, in, the, absence, of, popular, support, ali, eventually, accepted, the, temporal, rule, of, abu, bakr, probably, for, the, sake, of, muslim, unity, in, particular, ali, turned, down, proposals, to, forcefully, pursue, the, caliphate, he, nevertheless, viewed, himself, as, the, most, qualified, candidate, for, leadership, by, virtue, of, his, merits, and, his, kinship, with, muhammad, evidence, suggests, that, ali, further, considered, himself, as, the, designated, successor, of, muhammad, unlike, muhammad, s, lifetime, ali, retired, from, public, life, during, the, caliphates, of, abu, bakr, and, his, successors, umar, and, uthman, ali, did, not, participate, in, the, ridda, wars, and, the, early, muslim, conquests, though, he, remained, an, advisor, to, abu, bakr, and, umar, on, government, and, religious, matters, however, their, conflicts, with, ali, is, also, well, documented, but, largely, ignored, in, sunni, sources, these, tensions, were, epitomized, during, the, proceedings, of, the, electoral, council, in, 644, when, ali, refused, to, be, bound, by, the, precedence, of, the, first, two, caliphs, in, contrast, shia, sources, view, ali, s, pledge, to, abu, bakr, as, a, coerced, act, of, political, expediency, taqiya, the, conflicts, with, ali, are, probably, magnified, in, shia, sources, before, his, death, in, 634, abu, bakr, designated, umar, as, his, successor, ali, was, not, consulted, about, this, appointment, which, was, initially, resisted, by, some, senior, companions, ali, himself, did, not, press, any, claims, this, time, and, kept, aloof, from, public, affairs, during, the, caliphate, of, umar, who, nevertheless, consulted, ali, in, certain, matters, for, instance, ali, is, credited, with, the, idea, of, adopting, the, migration, to, medina, hijra, as, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, calendar, yet, ali, s, political, advice, was, probably, ignored, for, example, umar, devised, a, state, register, diwan, to, distribute, excess, state, revenues, according, to, islamic, precedence, but, ali, held, that, those, revenues, should, be, equally, distributed, among, muslims, following, the, practice, of, muhammad, and, abu, bakr, ali, was, also, absent, from, the, strategic, meeting, of, notables, near, damascus, ali, did, not, participate, in, umar, s, military, expeditions, although, he, does, not, seem, to, have, publicly, objected, to, them, umar, likely, opposed, the, combination, of, prophethood, and, caliphate, in, the, banu, hashim, and, he, thus, prevented, muhammad, from, dictating, his, will, on, his, deathbed, possibly, fearing, that, he, might, expressly, designate, ali, as, his, successor, nevertheless, perhaps, realizing, the, necessity, of, ali, s, cooperation, in, his, collaborative, scheme, of, governance, umar, made, some, limited, overtures, to, ali, and, the, banu, hashim, during, his, caliphate, for, instance, umar, returned, muhammad, s, estates, in, medina, to, ali, but, kept, fadak, and, khayber, by, some, accounts, umar, also, insisted, on, marrying, ali, s, daughter, umm, kulthum, to, which, ali, reluctantly, agreed, when, the, former, enlisted, public, support, for, his, demand, before, his, death, in, 644, umar, tasked, a, small, committee, with, choosing, the, next, caliph, among, themselves, ali, and, uthman, were, the, strongest, candidates, in, this, committee, whose, members, were, all, early, companions, of, muhammad, from, the, quraysh, tribe, another, member, abd, al, rahman, ibn, awf, was, given, the, deciding, vote, either, by, the, committee, or, by, umar, after, deliberations, ibn, awf, appointed, his, brother, in, law, uthman, as, the, next, caliph, when, the, latter, promised, to, follow, the, precedent, of, the, first, two, caliphs, by, contrast, ali, rejected, this, condition, or, gave, an, evasive, answer, the, ansar, were, not, represented, in, the, committee, which, was, evidently, biased, toward, uthman, both, of, these, factors, worked, against, ali, who, could, have, not, been, simply, excluded, from, the, proceedings, uthman, was, widely, accused, of, nepotism, corruption, and, injustice, ali, too, criticized, uthman, s, conduct, including, his, lavish, gifts, for, his, kinsmen, ali, also, protected, outspoken, companions, such, as, abu, dharr, and, ammar, and, overall, acted, as, a, restraining, influence, on, uthman, some, supporters, of, ali, were, part, of, the, opposition, movement, joined, in, their, efforts, by, talha, and, zubayr, both, senior, companions, of, muhammad, and, by, his, widow, aisha, among, such, supporters, of, ali, were, malik, al, ashtar, and, other, religiously, learned, qurra, lit, quran, readers, these, supporters, wanted, to, see, ali, as, the, next, caliph, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, coordinated, with, them, ali, also, rejected, the, requests, to, lead, the, rebels, although, he, probably, sympathized, with, their, grievances, he, was, therefore, considered, a, natural, focus, for, the, opposition, at, least, morally, as, their, grievances, mounted, provincial, dissidents, poured, into, medina, in, 656, the, egyptian, opposition, sought, the, advice, of, ali, who, urged, them, to, negotiate, with, uthman, ali, similarly, asked, the, iraqi, opposition, to, refrain, from, violence, which, they, heeded, he, also, repeatedly, mediated, between, uthman, and, the, dissidents, to, address, their, economical, and, political, grievances, in, particular, ali, negotiated, and, guaranteed, the, agreement, that, ended, the, first, siege, he, then, convinced, uthman, to, publicly, repent, but, the, caliph, soon, retracted, his, statement, possibly, pressed, by, his, secretary, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, egyptian, rebels, laid, siege, to, uthman, s, residence, for, a, second, time, when, they, intercepted, an, official, letter, ordering, their, punishment, they, demanded, the, caliph, s, abdication, but, he, refused, and, maintained, his, innocence, about, the, letter, for, which, marwan, is, often, blamed, in, the, early, sources, ali, also, sided, with, uthman, but, the, caliph, apparently, accused, him, about, the, letter, this, is, probably, when, ali, refused, to, further, intercede, for, uthman, who, was, assassinated, soon, afterward, by, egyptian, rebels, ali, played, no, role, in, the, deadly, attack, and, his, son, hasan, was, injured, while, guarding, uthman, s, besieged, residence, at, the, request, of, ali, he, also, convinced, the, rebels, to, deliver, water, to, uthman, s, house, during, the, siege, when, uthman, was, assassinated, in, 656, by, egyptian, rebels, the, potential, candidates, for, caliphate, were, ali, and, talha, the, umayyads, had, fled, medina, leaving, the, provincial, rebels, and, the, ansar, in, control, of, the, city, among, the, egyptians, talha, enjoyed, some, support, but, the, iraqis, and, most, of, the, ansar, supported, ali, the, majority, of, the, muhajirun, and, key, tribal, figures, also, favored, ali, at, this, time, the, caliphate, was, offered, by, these, groups, to, ali, who, after, some, hesitation, publicly, took, the, oath, of, office, malik, al, ashtar, might, have, been, the, first, to, pledge, his, allegiance, to, ali, talha, and, zubayr, who, both, aspired, to, the, caliphate, also, gave, their, pledges, to, ali, most, likely, willingly, but, later, broke, their, oaths, ali, probably, did, not, force, anyone, to, pledge, and, there, is, little, evidence, of, any, violence, even, though, many, broke, with, ali, later, claiming, that, they, had, pledged, under, duress, at, the, same, time, the, supporters, who, were, in, majority, in, medina, might, have, intimidated, others, ali, thus, filled, the, power, vacuum, created, by, the, regicide, his, election, irregular, and, without, a, council, faced, little, public, opposition, in, medina, but, the, rebels, support, for, him, left, him, exposed, to, accusations, of, complicity, in, uthman, s, assassination, even, though, underprivileged, groups, readily, rallied, around, ali, he, had, limited, support, among, the, powerful, quraysh, some, of, whom, aspired, to, caliphate, within, the, quraysh, two, camps, opposed, ali, the, umayyads, who, believed, that, the, caliphate, was, their, right, after, uthman, and, those, who, wished, to, restore, the, caliphate, of, quraysh, on, the, same, principles, laid, by, abu, bakr, and, umar, this, second, group, was, likely, the, majority, within, the, quraysh, ali, was, indeed, vocal, about, the, divine, prerogative, of, muhammad, s, kin, to, leadership, which, would, have, jeopardized, the, political, ambitions, of, the, rest, of, the, quraysh, the, caliphate, of, ali, was, characterized, by, his, strict, justice, he, implemented, radical, policies, to, restore, his, vision, of, prophetic, governance, and, dismissed, nearly, all, of, uthman, s, governors, whom, he, considered, corrupt, ali, also, distributed, the, treasury, funds, equally, among, muslims, following, the, practice, of, muhammad, and, is, said, to, have, shown, zero, tolerance, for, corruption, some, of, those, affected, by, ali, s, egalitarian, policies, soon, revolted, against, him, under, the, pretext, of, revenge, for, uthman, among, them, was, mu, awiya, the, incumbent, governor, of, syria, ali, has, therefore, been, criticized, by, some, for, political, naivety, and, excessive, rigorism, and, praised, by, others, for, righteousness, and, lack, of, political, expediency, his, supporters, identify, similar, decisions, of, muhammad, and, argue, that, islam, never, allows, for, compromising, on, a, just, cause, citing, verse, 68, 9, of, the, quran, they, wish, that, thou, might, compromise, and, that, they, might, compromise, some, instead, suggest, that, ali, s, decisions, were, actually, justified, on, a, practical, level, for, instance, the, removal, of, unpopular, governors, was, perhaps, the, only, option, available, to, ali, because, injustice, was, the, main, grievance, of, the, rebels, as, evident, from, his, public, speeches, ali, viewed, himself, not, only, as, the, temporal, leader, of, the, muslim, community, but, also, as, its, exclusive, religious, authority, he, thus, laid, claim, to, the, religious, authority, to, interpret, the, quran, and, sunna, some, supporters, of, ali, indeed, held, him, as, their, divinely, guided, leader, who, deserved, the, same, type, of, loyalty, that, muhammad, did, they, felt, an, absolute, and, all, encompassing, bond, of, spiritual, loyalty, walaya, to, ali, that, transcended, politics, for, instance, many, of, them, publicly, offered, ali, their, unconditional, support, circa, 658, they, justified, their, absolute, loyalty, to, ali, on, the, basis, of, his, merits, precedent, in, islam, his, kinship, with, muhammad, and, also, the, announcement, by, the, latter, at, the, ghadir, khumm, many, of, these, supporters, also, viewed, ali, as, the, rightful, successor, to, muhammad, after, his, death, as, evidenced, in, the, poetry, from, that, period, for, instance, ali, opposed, centralized, control, over, provincial, revenues, he, equally, distributed, excess, taxes, and, booty, among, muslims, following, the, precedent, of, muhammad, and, abu, bakr, in, comparison, umar, had, distributed, the, state, revenues, according, to, perceived, islamic, merit, and, uthman, was, widely, accused, of, nepotism, and, corruption, the, strictly, egalitarian, policies, of, ali, earned, him, the, support, of, underprivileged, groups, including, the, ansar, the, qurra, and, the, late, immigrants, to, iraq, by, contrast, talha, and, zubayr, were, both, qurayshite, companions, of, muhammad, who, had, amassed, immense, wealth, under, uthman, they, both, revolted, against, ali, when, he, refused, to, grant, them, favors, some, other, figures, among, the, quraysh, similarly, turned, against, ali, who, even, withheld, public, funds, from, his, relatives, whereas, his, archenemy, mu, awiya, readily, offered, bribes, ali, instructed, his, officials, to, collect, tax, payments, on, a, voluntary, basis, and, without, harassment, and, to, prioritize, the, poor, when, distributing, public, funds, a, letter, attributed, to, ali, directs, his, governor, to, pay, more, attention, to, land, development, than, taxation, during, the, muslim, civil, war, ali, forbade, his, soldiers, from, looting, and, instead, paid, them, from, tax, revenues, he, also, pardoned, his, enemies, in, victory, both, of, these, practices, were, later, enshrined, in, islamic, law, ali, also, advised, his, commander, al, ashtar, not, to, reject, any, calls, to, peace, not, to, violate, any, agreements, and, ordered, him, not, to, commence, hostilities, ali, similarly, barred, his, troops, from, disturbing, civilians, killing, the, wounded, and, those, who, fled, mutilating, the, dead, entering, homes, without, permission, looting, and, harming, women, he, prevented, the, enslavement, of, women, in, victory, even, though, some, protested, before, the, battle, of, siffin, with, mu, awiya, ali, did, not, retaliate, and, allowed, his, enemies, to, access, drinking, water, when, he, gained, the, upper, hand, aisha, publicly, campaigned, against, ali, immediately, after, his, accession, she, was, joined, in, mecca, by, her, close, relatives, talha, and, zubayr, who, thus, broke, their, earlier, oaths, of, allegiance, to, ali, this, opposition, demanded, the, punishment, of, uthman, s, assassins, and, accused, ali, of, complicity, in, the, assassination, they, also, called, for, the, removal, of, ali, from, office, and, for, a, qurayshite, council, to, appoint, his, successor, their, primary, goal, was, likely, the, removal, of, ali, rather, than, vengeance, for, uthman, against, whom, the, triumvirate, had, stirred, up, public, opinion, the, opposition, failed, to, gain, enough, traction, in, hejaz, and, instead, captured, basra, in, iraq, killing, many, there, ali, raised, an, army, from, nearby, kufa, which, formed, the, core, of, ali, s, forces, in, the, coming, battles, the, two, armies, soon, camped, just, outside, of, basra, both, probably, numbered, around, ten, thousand, men, after, three, days, of, failed, negotiations, the, two, sides, readied, for, battle, the, battle, took, place, in, december, 656, the, rebels, commenced, hostilities, and, aisha, was, present, on, the, battlefield, riding, in, an, armored, palanquin, atop, a, red, camel, after, which, the, battle, is, named, talha, was, soon, killed, by, another, rebel, marwan, the, secretary, of, uthman, zubayr, an, experienced, fighter, deserted, shortly, after, the, battle, had, begun, but, was, pursued, and, killed, his, desertion, suggests, he, had, serious, moral, misgivings, about, their, cause, ali, won, the, day, and, aisha, was, respectfully, escorted, back, to, hejaz, ali, then, announced, a, public, pardon, setting, free, all, war, prisoners, even, marwan, and, prohibiting, the, enslavement, of, their, women, their, seized, properties, were, also, returned, ali, then, stationed, himself, in, kufa, which, thus, became, his, de, facto, capital, mu, awiya, the, incumbent, governor, of, syria, was, deemed, corrupt, and, unfit, by, ali, who, wrote, to, and, removed, him, from, his, post, in, turn, mu, awiya, as, uthman, s, cousin, launched, a, propaganda, campaign, across, syria, blaming, ali, for, the, regicide, and, calling, for, revenge, mu, awiya, also, joined, forces, with, amr, ibn, al, as, a, military, strategist, who, pledged, to, back, the, umayyads, against, ali, in, return, for, life, long, governorship, of, egypt, yet, mu, awiya, also, secretly, offered, to, recognize, the, caliphate, of, ali, in, return, for, syria, and, egypt, which, ali, rejected, mu, awiya, then, formally, declared, war, charging, ali, with, regicide, demanding, his, removal, and, a, syrian, council, thereafter, to, elect, the, next, caliph, contemporary, authors, tend, to, view, mu, awiya, s, call, for, revenge, as, a, pretext, for, a, power, grab, in, the, summer, of, 657, the, armies, of, ali, and, mu, awiya, camped, at, siffin, west, of, the, euphrates, river, numbering, perhaps, at, 100, 000, and, 130, 000, respectively, many, of, muhammad, s, companions, were, present, in, ali, s, army, whereas, mu, awiya, could, only, boast, a, handful, the, two, sides, negotiated, for, a, while, to, no, avail, after, which, the, main, battle, took, place, from, wednesday, 26, july, 657, until, friday, or, saturday, morning, ali, probably, refrained, from, initiating, hostilities, and, later, fought, alongside, his, men, on, the, frontline, whereas, mu, awiya, led, from, his, pavilion, and, rejected, a, proposal, to, settle, the, matters, in, a, personal, duel, with, ali, among, those, killed, fighting, for, ali, was, ammar, in, canonical, sunni, sources, a, prophetic, hadith, predicts, ammar, s, death, at, the, hands, of, al, fi, a, al, baghiya, lit, rebellious, aggressive, group, who, call, to, hellfire, fighting, stopped, when, some, syrians, raised, pages, of, the, quran, on, their, lances, shouting, let, the, book, of, god, be, the, judge, between, us, since, mu, awiya, had, for, long, insisted, on, battle, this, call, for, arbitration, suggests, that, he, now, feared, defeat, by, contrast, ali, exhorted, his, men, to, fight, telling, them, that, raising, qurans, was, for, deception, but, to, no, avail, through, their, representatives, the, qurra, and, the, ridda, tribesmen, of, kufa, the, largest, bloc, in, ali, s, army, both, threatened, ali, with, mutiny, if, he, did, not, answer, the, syrians, call, facing, strong, peace, sentiments, in, his, army, ali, accepted, the, arbitration, proposal, most, likely, against, his, own, judgment, mu, awiya, now, proposed, that, representatives, from, both, sides, should, find, a, quranic, resolution, mu, awiya, was, represented, by, his, ally, amr, whereas, despite, ali, s, opposition, the, majority, in, his, camp, pressed, for, the, neutral, abu, musa, the, erstwhile, governor, of, kufa, the, arbitration, agreement, was, written, and, signed, on, 2, august, 657, stipulating, that, the, two, representatives, should, meet, on, neutral, territory, adhere, to, the, quran, and, sunna, and, restore, peace, both, armies, left, the, battlefield, after, the, agreement, the, arbitration, agreement, thus, divided, ali, s, camp, as, many, did, not, support, his, negotiations, with, mu, awiya, whose, claims, they, considered, fraudulent, by, contrast, the, agreement, strengthened, mu, awiya, s, position, who, was, now, an, equal, contender, for, the, caliphate, some, of, ali, s, men, left, him, in, protest, to, the, arbitration, agreement, many, of, them, eventually, rejoined, ali, while, the, rest, gathered, in, the, town, of, al, nahrawan, they, became, known, as, the, kharijites, lit, seceders, who, later, took, up, arms, against, ali, in, the, battle, of, nahrawan, the, kharijites, many, of, whom, belonged, to, the, qurra, were, likely, disillusioned, with, the, arbitration, process, their, slogan, was, no, judgment, but, that, of, god, highlighting, their, rejection, of, arbitration, by, men, in, reference, to, the, quranic, verse, 49, 9, ali, called, this, slogan, a, word, of, truth, by, which, the, seceders, sought, falsehood, because, he, viewed, the, ruler, as, indispensable, in, the, conduct, of, religion, the, two, arbitrators, met, together, in, dumat, al, jandal, perhaps, in, february, 658, there, they, reached, the, verdict, that, uthman, had, been, killed, wrongfully, and, that, mu, awiya, had, the, right, to, seek, revenge, they, could, not, agree, on, anything, else, rather, than, a, judicial, ruling, this, was, a, political, concession, by, abu, musa, who, probably, hoped, that, amr, would, later, reciprocate, this, gesture, ali, denounced, the, conduct, of, the, two, arbitrators, as, contrary, to, the, quran, and, began, organizing, a, second, syria, campaign, solely, an, initiative, of, mu, awiya, there, was, also, a, second, meeting, in, udhruh, the, negotiations, there, also, failed, as, the, two, arbitrators, could, not, agree, on, the, next, caliph, amr, supported, mu, awiya, while, abu, musa, nominated, his, son, in, law, abd, allah, ibn, umar, who, stood, down, at, its, closure, abu, musa, publicly, deposed, both, mu, awiya, and, ali, and, called, for, a, council, to, appoint, his, successor, per, earlier, agreements, with, amr, when, amr, took, the, stage, however, he, deposed, ali, and, appointed, mu, awiya, as, his, successor, the, kufan, delegation, reacted, furiously, to, abu, musa, s, concessions, and, the, common, view, is, that, the, arbitration, failed, or, was, inconclusive, it, nevertheless, strengthened, the, syrians, support, for, mu, awiya, and, weakened, the, position, of, ali, after, the, arbitration, mu, awiya, received, the, syrians, pledge, as, caliph, ali, then, organized, a, new, much, smaller, syria, campaign, but, he, postponed, the, expedition, and, instead, marched, to, nahrawan, with, his, army, when, he, learned, that, the, kharijites, were, interrogating, and, executing, civilians, they, killed, many, apparently, not, even, sparing, women, ali, convinced, many, of, the, kharijites, to, separate, from, their, army, leaving, about, 1, 500, 1, 800, or, 2, 800, out, of, about, 4, 000, fighters, the, rest, of, the, kharijites, then, attacked, and, were, crushed, by, ali, s, army, of, about, 14, 000, men, the, battle, took, place, either, on, 17, july, 658, or, in, 657, ali, has, been, criticized, by, some, for, killing, his, erstwhile, allies, many, of, whom, were, outwardly, pious, muslims, for, others, subduing, the, kharijites, was, necessary, for, they, were, violent, and, radicalized, rebels, who, posed, a, danger, to, ali, s, base, in, kufa, following, the, battle, of, nahrawan, ali, could, not, muster, enough, support, for, a, second, syria, campaign, perhaps, his, soldiers, were, demoralized, or, perhaps, they, were, recalled, by, their, tribal, leaders, many, of, whom, had, been, bribed, and, swayed, by, mu, awiya, by, contrast, ali, did, not, grant, any, financial, favors, to, tribal, chiefs, as, a, matter, of, principle, at, any, rate, the, secession, of, so, many, of, the, qurra, and, the, coolness, of, the, tribal, leaders, weakened, ali, ali, consequently, lost, egypt, to, mu, awiya, in, 658, mu, awiya, also, began, dispatching, military, detachments, which, targeted, civilians, along, the, euphrates, river, near, kufa, and, most, successfully, in, the, hejaz, and, yemen, ali, could, not, mount, a, timely, response, to, these, assaults, he, eventually, found, sufficient, support, for, a, second, syria, offensive, set, to, commence, in, late, winter, 661, his, success, was, in, part, due, to, the, public, outrage, over, syrian, raids, however, plans, for, a, second, campaign, were, abandoned, after, the, assassination, of, ali, ali, was, assassinated, during, the, morning, prayer, on, 28, january, 661, 19, ramadan, 40, ah, at, the, great, mosque, of, kufa, the, other, given, dates, are, 26, and, 30, january, he, was, struck, over, his, head, by, the, kharijite, dissident, ibn, muljam, with, a, poison, coated, sword, in, revenge, for, their, defeat, in, the, battle, of, nahrawan, ali, died, from, his, wounds, about, two, days, later, aged, sixty, two, or, sixty, three, by, some, accounts, he, had, long, known, about, his, fate, by, premonition, or, through, muhammad, before, his, death, ali, requested, either, a, meticulous, application, of, lex, talionis, to, ibn, muljam, or, his, pardon, at, any, rate, ibn, muljam, was, later, executed, by, hasan, the, eldest, son, of, ali, fearing, that, his, body, might, be, exhumed, and, profaned, by, his, enemies, ali, s, burial, place, was, kept, a, secret, and, remains, uncertain, several, sites, are, mentioned, as, containing, ali, s, remains, including, the, shrine, of, ali, in, najaf, and, the, shrine, of, ali, in, mazar, the, former, site, was, identified, during, the, reign, of, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, r, 786, 809, and, the, town, of, najaf, developed, around, it, which, has, become, a, major, destination, for, shia, pilgrimage, the, present, shrine, was, built, by, the, safavid, monarch, safi, r, 1629, 1642, near, which, lies, an, immense, cemetery, for, shias, who, wished, to, be, buried, next, to, their, imam, najaf, is, also, home, to, top, religious, colleges, and, prominent, shia, scholars, other, sites, for, ali, s, burial, are, claimed, to, be, baghdad, damascus, medina, ray, while, a, minority, of, shias, believe, it, be, somewhere, in, the, city, of, kufa, when, ali, died, his, son, hasan, was, acknowledged, as, the, next, caliph, in, kufa, as, ali, s, legatee, hasan, was, the, obvious, choice, for, the, kufans, especially, because, ali, was, vocal, about, the, exclusive, right, of, muhammad, s, kin, to, leadership, most, surviving, companions, of, muhammad, were, in, ali, s, army, and, they, also, pledged, their, allegiance, to, hasan, but, overall, the, kufans, support, for, hasan, was, likely, weak, hasan, later, abdicated, in, august, 661, to, mu, awiya, when, the, latter, marched, on, iraq, with, a, large, force, mu, awiya, thus, founded, the, dynastic, umayyad, caliphate, throughout, his, reign, he, persecuted, the, family, and, supporters, of, ali, and, mandated, regular, public, cursing, of, ali, the, first, marriage, of, ali, was, to, fatima, who, bore, him, three, sons, hasan, husayn, and, muhsin, muhsin, either, died, in, infancy, or, fatima, miscarried, him, when, she, was, injured, in, a, raid, on, her, house, during, the, succession, crisis, the, descendants, of, hasan, and, husayn, are, known, as, the, hasanids, and, the, husaynids, respectively, as, the, progeny, of, muhammad, they, are, honored, in, muslim, communities, by, nobility, titles, such, as, sharif, and, sayyid, ali, and, fatima, also, had, two, daughters, zaynab, and, umm, kulthum, after, fatima, s, death, in, 632, ali, remarried, multiple, times, and, had, more, children, including, muhammad, al, awsat, and, abbas, ibn, ali, in, his, life, ali, fathered, seventeen, daughters, and, eleven, fourteen, or, eighteen, sons, among, whom, hasan, husayn, and, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyya, played, a, historical, role, descendants, of, ali, are, known, as, the, alids, mu, awiya, succeeded, ali, in, 661, and, founded, the, dynastic, umayyad, caliphate, during, which, alids, were, severely, persecuted, after, ali, his, followers, shi, a, recognized, his, eldest, son, hasan, as, their, imam, when, he, died, in, 670, likely, poisoned, at, the, instigation, of, mu, awiya, the, shia, community, followed, hasan, s, younger, brother, husayn, who, was, killed, by, umayyad, forces, in, the, battle, of, karbala, in, 680, alongside, many, of, his, relatives, to, revenge, the, karbala, massacre, soon, followed, in, 685, the, shia, uprising, of, al, mukhtar, who, claimed, to, represent, ibn, al, hanafiyya, the, main, movements, that, followed, this, uprising, were, the, now, extinct, kaysanites, and, the, imamites, the, kaysanites, mostly, followed, abu, hashim, the, son, of, ibn, al, hanafiya, when, abu, hashim, died, around, 716, this, group, largely, aligned, itself, with, the, abbasids, that, is, the, descendants, of, muhammad, s, uncle, abbas, on, the, other, hand, the, imamites, were, led, by, quiescent, descendants, of, husayn, through, his, only, surviving, son, ali, zayn, al, abidin, d, 713, an, exception, was, ali, s, son, zayd, who, led, a, failed, uprising, against, the, umayyads, around, 740, for, his, followers, known, as, the, zaydites, any, learned, hasanid, or, husaynid, who, rose, against, tyranny, qualified, as, imam, alids, were, also, persecuted, under, the, abbasids, who, toppled, the, umayyads, in, 750, some, of, the, alids, thus, revolted, while, some, established, regional, dynasties, in, remote, areas, in, particular, through, imprisonment, or, surveillance, the, abbasids, removed, the, imams, of, the, imamites, from, public, life, and, they, are, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, imams, deaths, mainstream, imamites, were, the, antecedents, of, the, twelvers, who, believe, that, their, twelfth, and, final, imam, muhammad, al, mahdi, was, born, around, 868, but, was, hidden, from, the, public, in, 874, for, fear, of, persecution, he, remains, in, occultation, by, divine, will, until, his, reappearance, at, the, end, of, time, to, eradicate, injustice, and, evil, the, only, historic, split, among, the, imamites, happened, when, their, sixth, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, died, in, 765, some, claimed, that, his, designated, successor, was, his, son, isma, il, who, had, predeceased, al, sadiq, these, were, the, antecedents, of, the, isma, ilites, who, found, political, success, at, the, turn, of, the, tenth, century, as, the, fatimid, caliphate, in, egypt, and, the, qarmatians, in, bahrain, most,

prophetic, hadiths, he, is, further, credited, with, the, first, systematic, evaluations, of, hadiths, and, is, often, considered, a, founding, figure, for, hadith, sciences, ali, is, also, regarded, by, some, as, the, founder, of, islamic, theology, and, his, sayings, contain, the, first, rational, proofs, of, the, unity, of, god, tawhid, in, islam, in, later, islamic, philosophy, ali, s, sayings, and, sermons, were, mined, for, metaphysical, knowledge, in, particular, nahj, al, balagha, is, a, vital, source, for, shia, philosophical, doctrines, after, the, quran, and, sunna, as, a, shia, imam, statements, and, practices, attributed, to, ali, are, widely, studied, in, shia, islam, where, they, are, viewed, as, the, continuation, of, prophetic, teachings, ali, is, known, by, many, honorifics, in, the, islamic, tradition, some, of, which, are, especially, used, by, shias, his, main, kunya, teknonym, was, ab, al, asan, father, of, al, hasan, his, titles, include, al, murta, lit, one, with, whom, is, pleased, or, one, who, is, chosen, and, contented, asad, all, h, lit, lion, of, god, aydar, lit, lion, the, name, initially, her, mother, gave, him, am, r, al, mu, min, n, lit, commander, of, the, faithful, or, prince, of, the, faithful, and, im, m, al, muttaqin, lit, leader, of, the, god, fearing, in, particular, twelvers, consider, the, title, of, amir, al, mu, minin, to, be, unique, to, ali, he, is, also, referred, to, as, ab, tur, b, lit, father, of, dust, which, might, have, initially, been, a, pejorative, by, his, enemies, often, praised, for, his, piety, and, courage, ali, fought, to, uphold, his, beliefs, but, was, also, magnanimous, in, victory, even, risking, the, ire, of, some, supporters, to, prevent, the, enslavement, of, women, he, also, showed, his, grief, wept, for, the, dead, and, reportedly, prayed, over, his, enemies, yet, ali, has, also, been, criticized, for, his, idealism, and, political, inflexibility, for, his, egalitarian, policies, and, strict, justice, antagonized, many, or, perhaps, these, qualities, were, also, present, in, muhammad, whom, the, quran, addresses, as, they, wish, that, thou, might, compromise, and, that, they, might, compromise, at, any, rate, these, qualities, of, ali, rooted, in, his, religious, beliefs, contributed, to, his, image, today, for, his, followers, as, a, paragon, of, islamic, virtues, particularly, justice, ali, is, also, viewed, as, the, model, par, excellence, for, islamic, chivalry, futuwwa, historical, accounts, about, ali, are, often, tendentious, for, instance, in, person, ali, is, described, in, some, sunni, sources, as, bald, heavy, built, short, legged, with, broad, shoulders, hairy, body, long, white, beard, and, affected, by, eye, inflammation, shia, accounts, about, the, appearance, of, ali, are, markedly, different, those, perhaps, better, match, his, reputation, as, a, capable, warrior, likewise, in, manner, ali, is, presented, in, some, sunni, sources, as, rough, brusque, and, unsociable, by, contrast, shia, sources, describe, him, as, generous, gentle, and, cheerful, to, the, point, that, the, syrian, war, propaganda, accused, him, of, frivolity, shia, and, sufi, sources, are, also, replete, with, reports, about, his, acts, of, kindness, especially, to, the, poor, the, necessary, qualities, in, a, commander, described, in, a, letter, attributed, to, ali, may, have, well, been, a, portrait, of, himself, slow, to, anger, happy, to, pardon, kind, to, the, weak, and, severe, with, the, strong, his, companion, sa, sa, a, ibn, suhan, described, him, similarly, he, was, amongst, us, as, one, of, us, of, gentle, disposition, intense, humility, leading, with, a, light, touch, even, though, we, were, in, awe, of, him, with, the, kind, of, awe, that, a, bound, prisoner, has, before, one, who, holds, a, sword, over, his, head, ali, s, place, is, said, to, be, second, only, to, muhammad, in, muslim, culture, ali, is, revered, for, his, courage, honesty, unbending, devotion, to, islam, magnanimity, and, equal, treatment, of, all, muslims, for, his, admirers, he, has, thus, become, the, archetype, of, uncorrupted, islam, and, pre, islamic, chivalry, ali, regularly, represented, muhammad, in, missions, which, are, commonly, linked, to, quranic, injunctions, for, instance, the, verse, of, walaya, 5, 55, is, a, reference, to, when, ali, gave, his, ring, to, a, beggar, while, praying, in, the, mosque, according, to, shia, and, some, sunni, accounts, if, so, then, this, verse, gives, ali, the, same, spiritual, authority, walaya, as, muhammad, in, shia, sources, the, verse, of, tabligh, 5, 67, spurred, muhammad, to, designate, ali, as, his, successor, at, the, ghadir, khumm, while, the, verse, of, ikmal, al, din, 5, 3, subsequently, announced, the, perfection, of, islam, the, verse, of, purification, 33, 33, concerns, the, status, of, purity, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, lit, people, of, the, house, which, is, limited, to, ali, fatima, and, their, two, sons, in, shia, and, some, sunni, sources, another, reference, to, the, ahl, al, bayt, might, be, the, verse, of, mawadda, 42, 23, for, shias, this, verse, is, a, quranic, mandate, to, love, and, follow, the, ahl, al, bayt, muhammad, frequently, praise, the, qualities, of, ali, the, most, controversial, such, statement, he, whose, mawla, i, am, ali, is, his, mawla, was, delivered, at, the, ghadir, khumm, this, gave, ali, the, same, spiritual, authority, walaya, as, muhammad, according, to, the, shia, elsewhere, the, hadith, of, the, position, likens, muhammad, and, ali, to, moses, and, aaron, and, thus, supports, the, usurped, right, of, ali, to, succeed, muhammad, in, shia, islam, other, examples, in, standard, shia, and, sunni, collections, of, hadith, include, there, is, no, youth, braver, than, ali, no, one, but, a, believer, loves, ali, and, no, one, but, a, hypocrite, munafiq, hates, ali, i, am, from, ali, and, ali, is, from, me, and, he, is, the, wali, lit, patron, or, guardian, of, every, believer, after, me, the, truth, revolves, around, him, wherever, he, goes, i, am, the, city, of, knowledge, and, ali, is, its, gate, bab, ali, is, with, the, quran, and, the, quran, is, with, ali, they, will, not, separate, until, they, return, to, me, at, the, pool, ali, is, the, common, source, of, mystical, and, spiritual, currents, within, both, sunni, and, shia, sects, of, islam, in, particular, ali, is, the, spiritual, head, of, some, sufi, movements, for, sufis, believe, that, ali, inherited, from, muhammad, his, esoteric, knowledge, and, saintly, authority, which, guide, believers, on, their, journey, toward, god, nearly, all, sufi, orders, trace, their, lineage, to, muhammad, through, ali, an, exception, being, the, naqshbandis, who, reach, muhammad, through, abu, bakr, in, sunni, islam, ali, is, venerated, as, a, close, companion, of, muhammad, a, foremost, authority, on, the, quran, and, islamic, law, and, the, fountainhead, of, wisdom, in, sunni, spirituality, when, the, prophet, died, in, 632, ali, had, his, claims, to, leadership, perhaps, in, reference, to, the, ghadir, khumm, but, he, eventually, accepted, the, temporal, rule, of, the, first, three, caliphs, in, the, interest, of, muslim, unity, ali, is, portrayed, in, sunni, sources, as, a, trusted, advisor, of, the, first, three, caliphs, while, their, conflicts, with, ali, are, minimized, in, line, with, the, sunni, tendency, to, show, accord, among, companions, as, the, fourth, and, final, rashidun, caliph, ali, holds, a, particularly, high, status, in, sunni, islam, although, this, doctrinal, reverence, for, ali, is, a, recent, development, for, which, the, prominent, sunni, traditionist, ibn, hanbal, d, 855, is, likely, to, be, credited, sunni, hierarchy, of, companions, places, ali, below, his, three, predecessors, and, above, those, who, fought, against, him, this, ordering, has, required, sunni, reinterpretation, of, those, prophetic, sayings, that, explicitly, elevate, ali, above, all, companions, ali, takes, center, stage, in, shia, islam, the, arabic, word, shi, a, itself, is, short, for, shi, a, of, ali, lit, followers, of, ali, his, name, is, incorporated, into, the, daily, call, to, prayer, adhan, and, he, is, regarded, as, the, foremost, companion, of, muhammad, the, defining, doctrine, of, shia, islam, is, that, ali, was, the, rightful, successor, of, muhammad, through, divinely, ordained, designation, which, is, primarily, a, reference, to, the, ghadir, khumm, ali, is, thought, to, have, inherited, the, political, and, religious, authority, of, muhammad, even, before, his, ascension, to, the, caliphate, in, 656, in, particular, ali, s, predecessors, are, regarded, as, illegitimate, rulers, and, usurpers, of, his, rights, the, all, encompassing, bond, of, loyalty, between, shia, muslims, and, their, imams, and, muhammad, in, his, capacity, as, imam, is, known, as, walaya, ali, is, also, thought, to, be, endowed, with, the, privilege, of, intercession, on, the, judgment, day, early, on, some, shias, even, attributed, divinity, to, ali, but, such, extreme, views, were, gradually, rooted, out, of, shi, ism, in, shia, belief, ali, also, inherited, the, esoteric, knowledge, of, muhammad, for, instance, in, view, of, the, prophetic, hadith, i, am, the, city, of, knowledge, and, ali, is, its, gate, ali, is, thus, regarded, after, muhammad, as, the, interpreter, par, excellence, of, the, quran, and, the, sole, authoritative, source, of, its, esoteric, teachings, unlike, muhammad, however, ali, is, not, thought, to, have, received, divine, revelation, wahy, though, he, might, have, been, guided, by, divine, inspiration, ilham, verse, 21, 73, of, the, quran, is, sometimes, cited, here, we, made, them, imams, guiding, by, our, command, and, we, revealed, awhayna, to, them, the, performance, of, good, deeds, the, maintenance, of, prayers, and, the, giving, of, zakat, alms, and, they, used, to, worship, us, shia, muslims, also, believe, in, the, infallibility, of, ali, as, with, muhammad, that, is, their, divine, protection, from, sins, here, the, verse, of, purification, is, sometimes, cited, ali, s, words, and, deeds, are, therefore, considered, a, model, for, the, shia, community, and, a, source, for, their, religious, injunctions, the, alawites, venerate, ali, the, first, of, the, twelve, imams, as, the, physical, manifestation, of, god, even, the, alawite, testimony, of, faith, shahada, translates, as, there, is, no, god, but, ali, the, alawite, trinity, envisions, god, as, being, composed, of, three, distinct, manifestations, ma, na, meaning, ism, name, and, bab, door, which, together, constitute, an, indivisible, trinity, ma, na, symbolises, the, source, and, meaning, of, all, things, in, alawite, mythology, according, to, alawite, doctrines, ma, na, generated, the, ism, which, in, turn, built, the, bab, these, beliefs, are, closely, tied, to, the, alawite, doctrine, of, reincarnations, of, the, trinity, the, final, trinity, of, reincarnation, in, the, alawite, trinity, consists, of, ali, ma, na, muhammad, ism, and, salman, the, persian, bab, alewites, depict, them, as, the, sky, sun, and, moon, respectively, alawites, deify, ali, as, the, last, and, supreme, manifestation, of, god, who, built, the, universe, attribute, to, him, divine, superiority, and, believe, that, ali, created, muhammad, and, gave, him, the, mission, to, spread, qur, anic, teachings, on, earth, in, the, druze, faith, ali, is, considered, a, minor, prophet, like, plato, and, socrates, even, though, the, faith, originally, developed, out, of, the, isma, ili, branch, of, shia, islam, the, druze, are, not, muslims, and, do, not, accept, the, five, pillars, of, islam, in, yarsanism, a, religion, founded, by, the, kurdish, mystic, sultan, sahak, ali, is, thought, to, be, an, incarnation, of, god, and, superior, to, muhammad, but, their, image, as, a, ghulat, lit, exaggerators, or, extremists, subsect, of, shia, islam, is, incorrect, much, has, been, written, about, ali, in, islamic, literature, second, only, to, muhammad, however, much, of, this, material, is, colored, by, a, positive, or, negative, bias, towards, ali, the, primary, sources, about, ali, are, the, quran, hadiths, and, other, early, islamic, works, the, most, notable, being, the, book, of, sulaym, ibn, qays, attributed, to, a, companion, of, ali, such, works, were, initially, scarce, but, this, changed, with, the, introduction, of, affordable, paper, in, the, abbasid, period, for, instance, at, least, twenty, one, monographs, were, composed, on, the, battle, of, siffin, between, 750, and, 950, thirteen, of, which, were, authored, by, the, early, historian, abu, mikhnaf, d, 773, 774, most, of, these, monographs, are, not, extant, except, through, quotations, in, later, collections, such, as, the, tenth, century, tarikh, al, tabari, in, addition, to, numerous, works, authored, by, muslims, the, secondary, sources, about, ali, include, writings, of, arab, christians, hindus, and, also, works, by, western, scholars, when, writing, about, ali, early, western, scholars, often, dismissed, as, fabricated, the, reports, gathered, in, later, periods, because, their, authors, often, advanced, their, own, sunni, or, shia, partisan, views, for, instance, l, caetani, d, 1935, often, rejected, the, historical, reports, attributed, to, the, pro, ali, ibn, abbas, and, anti, ali, aisha, caetani, instead, preferred, accounts, reported, without, isnad, by, early, historians, like, ibn, ishaq, d, 767, by, contrast, w, madelung, d, 2023, argued, that, the, tendentiousness, of, a, report, alone, does, not, imply, its, fabrication, madelung, instead, advocated, for, the, authentication, of, historical, reports, on, the, basis, of, their, compatibility, with, other, events, and, figures
