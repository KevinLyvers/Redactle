or, farcical, and, typically, built, around, a, star, because, the, efforts, of, rodgers, and, hammerstein, were, so, successful, many, musicals, that, followed, contained, thought, provoking, plots,

as, having, had, a, crucial, influence, on, his, work, rodgers, and, hammerstein, also, use, the, technique, of, what, some, call, the, formula, musical, while, some, hail, this, approach, others, criticize, it, for, its, predictability, the, term, formula, musical, may, refer, to, a, musical, with, a, predictable, plot, but, it, also, refers, to, the, casting, requirements, of, rodgers, hammerstein, characters, typically, any, musical, from, this, team, will, have, the, casting, of, a, strong, baritone, lead, a, dainty, and, light, soprano, lead, a, supporting, lead, tenor, and, a, supporting, alto, lead, although, there, are, exceptions, to, this, generalization, it, simplifies, the, audition, process, and, gives, audiences, an, idea, of, what, to, expect, vocally, from, a, rodgers, and, hammerstein, musical, however, this, formula, had, been, used, in, viennese, operetta, such, as, the, merry, widow, william, a, everett, and, paul, r, laird, wrote, that, oklahoma, like, show, boat, became, a, milestone, so, that, later, historians, writing, about, important, moments, in, twentieth, century, theatre, would, begin, to, identify, eras, according, to, their, relationship, to, oklahoma, in, the, complete, book, of, light, opera, mark, lubbock, adds, after, oklahoma, rodgers, and, hammerstein, were, the, most, important, contributors, to, the, musical, play, form, with, such, masterworks, as, carousel, the, king, and, i, and, south, pacific, the, examples, they, set, in, creating, vital, plays, often, rich, with, social, thought, provided, the, necessary, encouragement, for, other, gifted, writers, to, create, musical, plays, of, their, own, in, 1950, the, team, of, rodgers, and, hammerstein, received, the, hundred, year, association, of,
