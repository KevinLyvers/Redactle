career, rogers, eventually, came, to, be, described, as, agnostic, however, in, his, later, years, it, is, reported, he, spoke, about, spirituality, thorne, who, knew, rogers, and, worked, with, him, on, a, number, of, occasions, during, his, final, ten, years, writes, that, in, his, later, years, his, openness, to, experience, compelled, him, to, acknowledge, the, existence, of, a, dimension, to, which, he, attached, such, adjectives, as, mystical, spiritual, and, transcendental, rogers, concluded, that, there, is, a, realm, beyond, scientific, psychology, a, realm, he, came, to, prize, as, the, indescribable, the, spiritual, after, two, years, rogers, left, the, seminary, to, attend, teachers, college, columbia, university, obtaining, an, m, a, in, 1927, and, a, ph, d, in, 1931, while,

1983, he, remained, a, la, jolla, resident, for, the, rest, of, his, life, doing, therapy, giving, speeches, and, writing, rogers, s, last, years, were, devoted, to, applying, his, theories, in,

a, successful, operation, but, his, pancreas, failed, the, next, night, and, he, died, a, few, days, later, after, a, heart, attack, one, of, rogers, s, most, famous, lines, is, death, is, final, and, accepting, that, is, the, most, difficult, thing, to, undertake, that, loved, one, is, not, coming, back, and, nothing, can, change, that, nothing, compares, to, them, life, is, precious, and, vulnerable, so, be, wise, with, how, you, choose, to, spend, it, because, once, death, arrives, there, is, no, turning, back, rogers, s, theory, of, the, self, is, considered, humanistic, existential, and, phenomenological, it, is, based, directly, on, the, phenomenal, field, personality, theory, of, combs, and, snygg, 1949, rogers, s, elaboration, of, his, theory, is, extensive, he, wrote, 16, books, and, many, more, journal, articles, about, it, prochaska, and, norcross, 2003, states, rogers, consistently, stood, for, an, empirical, evaluation, of, psychotherapy, he, and, his, followers, have, demonstrated, a, humanistic, approach, to, conducting, therapy, and, a, scientific, approach, to, evaluating, therapy, need, not, be, incompatible, rogers, s, theory, as, of, 1951, was, based, on, 19, propositions, in, relation, to, no, 17, rogers, is, known, for, practicing, unconditional, positive, regard, which, is, defined, as, accepting, a, person, without, negative, judgment, of, basic, worth, with, regard, to, development, rogers, described, principles, rather, than, stages, the, main, issue, is, the, development, of, a, self, concept, and, the, progress, from, an, undifferentiated, self, to, being, fully, differentiated, self, concept, the, organized, consistent, conceptual, gestalt, composed, of, perceptions, of, the, characteristics, of, i, or, me, and, the, perceptions, of, the, relationships, of, the, i, or, me, to, others, and, to, various, aspects, of, life, together, with, the, values, attached, to, these, perceptions, it, is, a, gestalt, which, is, available, to, awareness, though, not, necessarily, in, awareness, it, is, a, fluid, and, changing, gestalt, a, process, but, at, any, given, moment, it, is, a, specific, entity, rogers, 1959, in, the, development, of, the, self, concept, he, saw, conditional, and, unconditional, positive, regard, as, key, those, raised, in, an, environment, of, unconditional, positive, regard, have, the, opportunity, to, fully, actualize, themselves, those, raised, in, an, environment, of, conditional, positive, regard, feel, worthy, only, if, they, match, conditions, what, rogers, describes, as, conditions, of, worth, that, others, have, laid, down, for, them, optimal, development, as, referred, to, in, proposition, 14, results, in, a, certain, process, rather, than, static, state, rogers, calls, this, the, good, life, where, the, organism, continually, aims, to, fulfill, its, potential, he, listed, the, characteristics, of, a, fully, functioning, person, rogers, 1961, this, process, of, the, good, life, is, not, i, am, convinced, a, life, for, the, faint, hearted, it, involves, the, stretching, and, growing, of, becoming, more, and, more, of, one, s, potentialities, it, involves, the, courage, to, be, it, means, launching, oneself, fully, into, the, stream, of, life, rogers, 1961, rogers, identified, the, real, self, as, the, aspect, of, a, person, that, is, founded, in, the, actualizing, tendency, follows, organismic, values, and, needs, and, receives, positive, regard, from, others, and, self, on, the, other, hand, to, the, extent, that, society, is, out, of, sync, with, the, actualizing, tendency, and, people, are, forced, to, live, with, conditions, of, worth, that, are, out, of, step, with, organismic, valuing, receiving, only, conditional, positive, regard, and, self, regard, rogers, said, that, people, develop, instead, an, ideal, self, by, ideal, he, was, suggesting, something, not, real, something, always, out, of, reach, a, standard, people, cannot, meet, this, gap, between, the, real, self, and, the, ideal, self, the, i, am, and, the, i, should, rogers, called, incongruity, rogers, described, the, concepts, of, congruence, and, incongruence, as, important, in, his, theory, in, proposition, 6, he, refers, to, the, actualizing, tendency, at, the, same, time, he, recognized, the, need, for, positive, regard, in, a, fully, congruent, person, realizing, their, potential, is, not, at, the, expense, of, experiencing, positive, regard, they, are, able, to, lead, authentic, and, genuine, lives, incongruent, individuals, in, their, pursuit, of, positive, regard, lead, lives, that, include, falsity, and, do, not, realize, their, potential, conditions, put, on, them, by, those, around, them, make, it, necessary, for, them, to, forgo, their, genuine, authentic, lives, to, meet, with, others, approval, they, live, lives, that, are, not, true, to, themselves, rogers, suggested, that, the, incongruent, individual, who, is, always, on, the, defensive, and, cannot, be, open, to, all, experiences, is, not, functioning, ideally, and, may, even, be, malfunctioning, they, work, hard, at, maintaining, and, protecting, their, self, concept, because, their, lives, are, not, authentic, this, is, difficult, and, they, are, under, constant, threat, they, deploy, defense, mechanisms, to, achieve, this, he, describes, two, mechanisms, distortion, and, denial, distortion, occurs, when, the, individual, perceives, a, threat, to, their, self, concept, they, distort, the, perception, until, it, fits, their, self, concept, this, defensive, behavior, reduces, the, consciousness, of, the, threat, but, not, the, threat, itself, and, so, as, the, threats, mount, the, work, of, protecting, the, self, concept, becomes, more, difficult, and, the, individual, becomes, more, defensive, and, rigid, in, their, self, structure, if, the, incongruity, is, immoderate, this, process, may, lead, the, individual, to, a, state, that, would, typically, be, described, as, neurotic, their, functioning, becomes, precarious, and, psychologically, vulnerable, if, the, situation, worsens, it, is, possible, that, the, defenses, cease, to, function, altogether, and, the, individual, becomes, aware, of, the, incongruity, of, their, situation, their, personality, becomes, disorganised, and, bizarre, irrational, behavior, associated, with, earlier, denied, aspects, of, self, may, erupt, uncontrollably, rogers, originally, developed, his, theory, as, the, foundation, for, a, system, of, therapy, he, initially, called, it, non, directive, therapy, but, later, replaced, the, term, non, directive, with, client, centered, and, still, later, person, centered, even, before, the, publication, of, client, centered, therapy, in, 1951, rogers, believed, the, principles, he, was, describing, could, be, applied, in, a, variety, of, contexts, not, just, in, therapy, as, a, result, he, started, to, use, the, term, person, centered, approach, to, describe, his, overall, theory, person, centered, therapy, is, the, application, of, the, person, centered, approach, to, therapy, other, applications, include, a, theory, of, personality, interpersonal, relations, education, nursing, cross, cultural, relations, and, other, helping, professions, and, situations, in, 1946, rogers, co, authored, counseling, with, returned, servicemen, with, john, l, wallen, the, creator, of, the, behavioral, model, known, as, the, interpersonal, gap, documenting, the, application, of, person, centered, approach, to, counseling, military, personnel, returning, from, world, war, ii, the, first, empirical, evidence, of, the, client, centered, approach, s, effectiveness, was, published, in, 1941, at, the, ohio, state, university, by, elias, porter, using, the, recordings, of, therapeutic, sessions, between, rogers, and, his, clients, porter, used, rogers, s, transcripts, to, devise, a, system, to, measure, the, degree, of, directiveness, or, non, directiveness, a, counselor, employed, the, counselor, s, attitude, and, orientation, were, shown, to, be, instrumental, in, the, decisions, the, client, made, the, application, to, education, has, a, large, robust, research, tradition, similar, to, that, of, therapy, with, studies, having, begun, in, the, late, 1930s, and, continuing, today, cornelius, white, 2007, rogers, described, the, approach, to, education, in, client, centered, therapy, and, wrote, freedom, to, learn, devoted, exclusively, to, the, subject, in, 1969, freedom, to, learn, was, revised, twice, the, new, learner, centered, model, is, similar, in, many, regards, to, this, classical, person, centered, approach, to, education, before, rogers, s, death, he, and, harold, lyon, began, a, book, on, becoming, an, effective, teacher, person, centered, teaching, psychology, philosophy, and, dialogues, with, carl, r, rogers, and, harold, lyon, that, lyon, and, reinhard, tausch, completed, and, published, in, 2013, it, contains, rogers, s, last, unpublished, writings, on, person, centered, teaching, rogers, had, the, following, five, hypotheses, regarding, learner, centered, education, in, 1970, richard, young, alton, l, becker, and, kenneth, pike, published, rhetoric, discovery, and, change, a, widely, influential, college, writing, textbook, that, used, a, rogerian, approach, to, communication, to, revise, the, traditional, aristotelian, framework, for, rhetoric, the, rogerian, method, of, argument, involves, each, side, restating, the, other, s, position, to, the, satisfaction, of, the, other, among, other, principles, in, a, paper, it, can, be, expressed, by, carefully, acknowledging, and, understanding, the, opposition, rather, than, dismissing, them, the, application, to, cross, cultural, relations, has, involved, workshops, in, highly, stressful, situations, and, global, locations, including, conflicts, and, challenges, in, south, africa, central, america, and, ireland, rogers, alberto, zucconi, and, charles, devonshire, co, founded, the, istituto, dell, approccio, centrato, sulla, persona, person, centered, approach, institute, in, rome, italy, rogers, s, international, work, for, peace, culminated, in, the, rust, peace, workshop, which, took, place, in, november, 1985, in, rust, austria, leaders, from, 17, nations, convened, to, discuss, the, topic, the, central, america, challenge, the, meeting, was, notable, for, several, reasons, it, brought, national, figures, together, as, people, not, as, their, positions, it, was, a, private, event, and, was, an, overwhelming, positive, experience, where, members, heard, one, another, and, established, real, personal, ties, as, opposed, to, stiffly, formal, and, regulated, diplomatic, meetings, some, scholars, believe, there, is, a, politics, implicit, in, rogers, s, approach, to, psychotherapy, toward, the, end, of, his, life, rogers, came, to, that, view, himself, the, central, tenet, of, rogerian, person, centered, politics, is, that, public, life, need, not, consist, of, an, endless, series, of, winner, take, all, battles, among, sworn, opponents, rather, it, can, and, should, consist, of, an, ongoing, dialogue, among, all, parties, such, dialogue, is, characterized, by, respect, among, the, parties, authentic, speaking, by, each, and, ultimately, empathic, understanding, among, all, parties, out, of, such, understanding, mutually, acceptable, solutions, will, or, at, least, can, flow, during, his, last, decade, rogers, facilitated, or, participated, in, a, wide, variety, of, dialogic, activities, among, politicians, activists, and, other, social, leaders, often, outside, the, u, s, he, also, lent, his, support, to, several, non, traditional, u, s, political, initiatives, including, the, 12, hour, political, party, of, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, and, the, founding, of, a, transformational, political, organization, the, new, world, alliance, by, the, 21st, century, interest, in, dialogic, approaches, to, political, engagement, and, change, had, become, widespread, especially, among, academics, and, activists, theorists, of, a, specifically, rogerian, person, centered, approach, to, politics, as, dialogue, have, made, substantial, contributions, to, that, project, from, the, late, 1950s, into, the, 60s, rogers, served, on, the, board, of, the, human, ecology, fund, a, cia, funded, organization, that, provided, grants, to, researchers, looking, into, personality, in, addition, he, and, other, people, in, the, field, of, personality, and, psychotherapy, were, given, a, lot, of, information, about, khrushchev, we, were, asked, to, figure, out, what, we, thought, of, him, and, what, would, be, the, best, way, of, dealing, with, him, and, that, seemed, to, be, an, entirely, principled, and, legitimate, aspect, i, don, t, think, we, contributed, very, much, but, anyway, we, tried, howard, kirschenbaum, has, conducted, extensive, research, on, the, work, of, carl, rogers, and, the, person, centered, client, centered, approach, kirschenbaum, published, the, first, thorough, book, in, english, on, rogers, life, and, work, titled, on, becoming, carl, rogers, in, 1979, followed, by, the, biography, the, life, and, work, of, carl, rogers, in, 2007
