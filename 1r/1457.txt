which, earned, him, 57, 000, francs, the, equivalent, of, more, than, a, million, 1983, francs, the, history, of, thiers, was, particularly, popular, in, liberal, circles, and, among, younger, parisians, it, praised, the, principles, leaders, and, accomplishments, of, the, 1789, revolution, though, not, the, later, terror, and, condemned, the, monarchy, aristocracy, and, clergy, for, their, inability, to, change, the, book, played, a, notable, role, in, undermining, the, legitimacy, of, the, bourbon, regime, of, charles, x, and, bringing, about, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, the, work, was, praised, by, the, french, authors, chateaubriand, stendhal, and, sainte, beuve, was, translated, into, english, 1838, and, spanish, 1889, and, won, him, a, seat, in, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1834, it, was, less, appreciated, by, british, critics, in, large, part, because, of, his, favorable, view, of, the, french, revolution, and, of, napoleon, bonaparte, the, british, historian, thomas, carlyle, who, wrote, his, own, history, of, the, french, revolution, complained, that, it, was, far, as, possible, from, meriting, its, high, reputation, though, he, admitted, that, thiers, is, a, brisk, man, in, his, way, and, will, tell, you, much, if, you, know, nothing, the, historian, george, saintsbury, wrote, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, 1911, thiers, historical, work, is, marked, by, extreme, inaccuracy, by, prejudice, which, passes, the, limits, of, accidental, unfairness, and, by, an, almost, complete, indifference, to, the, merits, as, compared, with, the, successes, of, his, heroes, a, new, king, charles, x, had, come, to, the, french, throne, in, 1824, with, a, strong, belief, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, and, the, worthlessness, of, parliamentary, government, thiers, had, been, planning, a, literary, career, but, in, august, 1829, when, the, king, appointed, the, ultra, royalist, polignac, as, his, new, prime, minister, thiers, began, to, write, increasingly, fierce, attacks, on, the, royal, government, in, a, celebrated, article, he, wrote, that, the, king, rules, but, does, not, govern, and, called, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, if, the, king, did, not, accept, it, he, proposed, simply, changing, the, king, as, the, english, had, done, in, 1688, when, the, constitutionel, hesitated, to, publish, some, of, his, more, energetic, attacks, on, the, government, thiers, with, armand, carrel, mignet, stendhal, and, others, started, a, new, opposition, newspaper, the, national, whose, first, issue, appeared, on, 3, january, 1830, the, government, responded, by, taking, the, newspaper, to, court, charging, it, with, attacks, on, the, person, of, the, king, and, that, of, the, royal, family, it, was, fined, three, thousand, francs, the, writer, lamartine, left, a, vivid, description, of, thiers, with, whom, he, had, dinner, at, this, time, he, spoke, first, he, spoke, last, he, hardly, listened, to, the, replies, but, he, spoke, with, an, accuracy, with, an, audacity, with, a, fecundity, of, ideas, that, excused, his, volubility, of, words, from, his, lips, it, was, his, spirit, and, heart, which, spoke, there, was, enough, gunpowder, in, his, nature, to, explode, six, governments, in, august, 1829, charles, x, had, decided, to, show, his, authority, over, the, unruly, chamber, of, deputies, and, named, a, fervent, royalist, jules, de, polignac, as, his, new, prime, minister, on, 19, march, 1830, he, raised, the, temperature, warning, that, if, the, deputies, put, obstacles, in, his, path, he, would, find, the, force, to, overcome, them, in, my, resolution, to, maintain, the, public, peace, with, the, full, confidence, of, the, french, and, the, love, they, have, also, shown, toward, their, king, he, also, launched, an, overseas, expedition, for, the, conquest, of, algeria, which, he, was, certain, would, increase, his, popularity, at, home, and, called, for, new, elections, which, he, was, certain, he, would, win, the, french, flag, was, hoisted, over, algiers, on, 5, july, 1830, and, new, elections, were, held, from, 13, to, 19, july, the, elections, were, a, disaster, for, the, king, the, opposition, won, 270, seats, against, 145, supporters, of, the, king, the, opponents, were, for, the, most, part, not, republicans, they, simply, wanted, a, constitutional, monarchy, the, king, responded, however, on, 25, july, with, new, decrees, dissolving, the, chamber, of, deputies, changing, the, election, laws, and, putting, restrictions, on, the, press, the, king, confident, in, his, popularity, neglected, to, put, the, army, on, alert, or, to, bring, in, soldiers, to, maintain, order, thiers, reacted, immediately, and, forcefully, on, the, front, page, of, his, newspaper, the, national, he, declared, the, legal, regime, is, over, that, of, force, has, begun, in, the, situation, in, which, we, are, placed, obedience, has, ceased, to, be, an, obligation, he, persuaded, the, editors, of, the, other, major, liberal, newspapers, to, publish, a, joint, declaration, of, opposition, which, was, published, on, the, morning, of, 27, july, later, that, morning, the, prefect, of, police, arrived, at, the, national, with, orders, to, put, the, newspaper, out, of, business, he, brought, workers, who, seized, key, mechanical, parts, of, the, printing, presses, and, locked, the, building, as, soon, as, the, prefect, left, the, same, workers, who, had, locked, the, building, and, disabled, the, presses, re, opened, it, and, put, the, presses, back, into, service, anti, royalist, demonstrations, broke, out, in, many, parts, of, paris, thiers, and, his, allies, briefly, left, the, city, to, avoid, arrest, but, soon, came, back, thiers, noticed, that, the, anti, royalist, demonstrators, had, attacked, shops, which, had, signs, showing, that, they, were, patronized, by, charles, x, but, not, those, which, advertised, they, were, patronized, by, the, king, s, cousin, louis, philippe, the, duke, of, orleans, whose, family, had, been, sympathetic, to, the, french, revolution, without, consulting, with, louis, philippe, whom, he, had, never, met, thiers, immediately, had, posters, printed, and, put, up, around, paris, declaring, that, the, duke, of, orleans, was, a, friend, of, the, people, and, he, should, take, the, crown, with, the, painter, ary, scheffer, a, friend, of, louis, philippe, he, rode, on, horseback, immediately, to, the, duke, s, residence, in, neuilly, but, found, that, the, duke, had, left, and, was, in, hiding, at, another, chateau, in, raincy, thiers, talked, instead, to, the, duke, s, wife, marie, am, lie, and, his, sister, madame, ad, la, de, thiers, explained, that, they, wanted, a, representative, monarchy, and, a, new, dynasty, and, that, everyone, knew, that, louis, philippe, was, not, ambitious, and, had, not, sought, the, crown, for, himself, madame, adelaide, agreed, to, take, the, proposition, to, the, duke, the, duke, returned, to, neuilly, at, ten, in, the, evening, and, learned, what, had, happened, from, his, wife, he, put, on, a, tricolor, ribbon, the, symbol, of, the, opposition, and, rode, to, the, palais, royal, where, thiers, the, marquis, de, lafayette, and, jacques, laffitte, were, waiting, together, they, persuaded, him, to, take, the, throne, and, discussed, how, it, would, be, done, that, afternoon, they, rode, to, the, hotel, de, ville, louis, philippe, wrapped, in, a, tricolor, flag, was, presented, to, the, huge, and, cheering, crowd, in, front, of, the, hotel, de, ville, by, lafayette, king, charles, x, withdrew, his, proposed, new, government, and, offered, to, negotiate, but, it, was, too, late, he, and, his, son, departed, the, chateau, of, saint, cloud, and, left, france, for, exile, in, england, when, the, new, government, was, formed, thiers, with, no, government, experience, was, given, a, lesser,

salary, he, ranked, as, one, of, the, radical, supporters, of, the, new, dynasty, in, opposition, to, the, party, of, which, his, rival, fran, ois, guizot, was, the, chief, literary, man, and, guizot, s, patron, the, duc, de, broglie, the, main, pillar, to, have, real, influence, and, independence, thiers, knew, that, he, needed, a, seat, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, not, just, a, government, position, but, to, be, eligible, to, run, he, needed, to, own, property, important, enough, that, he, paid, taxes, of, at, least, one, thousand, francs, a, year, his, intimate, friend, madame, dosne,

speech, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, on, the, financial, situation, of, the, country, a, month, after, his, election, he, had, no, experience, as, an, orator, because, of, his, small, stature, his, head, barely, appeared, over, the, podium, and, he, spoke, with, strong, proven, al, accent, which, made, the, parisians, smile, the, long, carefully, prepared, speech, was, greeted, at, the, end, with, silence, though, the, content, was, approved, thiers, worked, very, hard, to, improve, his, speaking, style, and, eventually, became, a, very, effective, orator, the, new, government, faced, many, difficulties, it, gradually, divided, into, two, informal, parties, the, so, called, party, of, movement, to, which, thiers, belonged, which, wanted, the, maximum, number, of, reforms, as, soon, as, possible, and, the, conservative, party, of, order, who, once, the, new, government, was, installed, wanted, no, further, turbulence, louis, philippe, made, jacques, laffitte, an, advocate, of, rapid, reform, his, chief, minister, in, the, anticipation, that, he, would, soon, fail, and, would, have, to, be, replaced, which, was, exactly, the, result, after, four, and, half, months, of, turmoil, the, king, dismissed, laffitte, and, replaced, him, with, a, supporter, of, order, casimir, p, rier, thiers, was, out, of, the, government, and, left, only, with, his, position, as, deputy,

will, never, make, anything, of, thiers, but, nonetheless, he, will, be, an, excellent, instrument, but, he, is, one, of, those, men, whom, you, can, make, use, of, only, if, you, give, them, satisfaction, but, he, is, never, satisfied, the, misfortune, for, you, and, for, him, is, that, you, cannot, make, him, a, cardinal, thiers, accepted, the, position, and, chose, a, government, keeping, for, himself, the, position, of, foreign, minister, he, told, the, chamber, of, deputies, our, country, is, in, the, middle, of, the, greatest, perils, and, we, must, fight, the, disorder, with, all, of, our, force, to, save, a, revolution, we, must, preserve, it, from, its, own, excesses, whether, these, excesses, are, produced, on, the, streets, or, in, the, abusive, use, of, institutions, i, will, contribute, through, force, and, by, the, laws, to, put, them, down, he, was, given, the, support, of, the, deputies, by, a, vote, of, 251, to, 99, his, new, government, proposed, the, construction, of, the, first, railroad, in, france, from, paris, to, saint, germain, though, thiers, privately, described, it, as, a, toy, for, the, parisians, and, suppressed, the, national, lottery, on, the, grounds, of, morality, violent, opposition, to, louis, philippe, increased, a, gunman, named, alibaud, attempted, to, shoot, louis, philippe, who, was, saved, by, the, armored, walls, of, his, carriage, the, police, linked, alibaud, to, a, secret, revolutionary, group, called, les, familles, by, armand, barb, s, and, louis, blanqui, both, were, arrested, and, imprisoned, but, later, released, and, went, on, to, much, more, ambitious, revolutionary, projects, because, of, the, new, threat, of, terrorist, attacks, louis, philippe, decided, not, to, inaugurate, the, newly, completed, arc, de, triomphe, begun, by, napoleon, thiers, dedicated, the, monument, on, 29, july, 1836, the, relationship, between, thiers, and, louis, philippe, became, more, and, more, strained, the, king, blocked, many, of, thiers, diplomatic, initiatives, and, conducted, his, own, foreign, policy, thiers, suggested, to, the, king, that, france, should, follow, the, british, model, and, allow, the, prime, minister, to, conduct, all, of, the, diplomatic, and, military, affairs, louis, philippe, refused, insisting, that, france, was, not, england, and, he, was, the, chief, diplomat, and, head, of, the, army, thiers, felt, he, had, no, alternative, but, to, resign, as, prime, minister, which, he, did, on, 29, august, 1836, his, place, was, taken, by, a, conservative, royalist, louis, mathieu, mol, out, of, office, he, traveled, in, italy, he, went, first, to, rome, where, his, friend, ingres, the, director, of, the, villa, medici, gave, him, a, tour, of, the, monuments, then, to, florence, where, he, had, the, idea, of, writing, a, history, of, that, city, he, rented, a, villa, at, lake, como, and, began, collecting, documents, for, his, research, he, went, to, italy, two, more, times, in, 1837, renting, the, villa, di, castello, and, going, through, the, archives, in, the, meanwhile, louis, philippe, was, increasingly, unpopular, he, survived, three, more, assassination, attempts, and, new, elections, on, 4, november, showed, gains, for, the, center, left, and, losses, for, the, center, right, thiers, returned, to, the, deputies, and, in, january, 1839, delivered, of, series, of, speeches, denouncing, the, government, of, the, king, led, by, mol, the, government, was, assaulted, from, all, sides, from, the, extreme, right, extreme, left, and, center, mol, was, forced, to, resign, and, call, for, new, elections, which, were, held, on, 2, march, 1839, the, opposition, won, the, elections, but, because, of, their, diverse, views, struggled, to, form, a, majority, for, three, months, france, was, without, a, government, the, most, radical, french, revolutionaries, barb, s, and, blanqui, saw, this, as, the, moment, to, launch, a, violent, revolution, they, had, formed, a, secret, organization, the, societ, des, saisons, with, about, fifteen, thousand, members, on, sunday, 12, march, 1839, when, the, center, of, paris, was, deserted, they, formed, armed, columns, and, successfully, seized, the, palais, de, justice, and, the, h, tel, de, ville, from, the, balcony, of, the, h, tel, de, ville, barb, s, read, a, decree, announcing, the, creation, of, a, revolutionary, government, but, the, army, reacted, immediately, and, by, the, evening, the, revolution, was, reduced, to, a, few, barricades, in, the, faubourg, saint, denis, barb, s, and, blanqui, were, arrested, and, sentenced, to, confinement, for, life, in, the, prison, on, mont, saint, michel, thiers, saw, his, moment, and, ran, for, president, of, the, chamber, but, was, narrowly, defeated, by, a, vote, of, 213, 206, louis, philippe, who, by, this, time, detested, thiers, said, with, satisfaction, that, thiers, had, the, effect, of, a, melon, striking, a, stone, but, thiers, still, had, a, strong, following, in, the, chamber, in, offering, him, the, position, of, head, of, the, government, louis, philippe, told, thiers, here, i, am, obliged, to, submit, to, you, and, accept, my, dishonor, you, have, been, forced, upon, me, you, will, put, my, children, out, onto, the, streets, but, finally, i, am, a, constitutional, king, and, i, have, no, choice, but, to, go, through, with, it, as, president, of, the, council, or, prime, minister, thiers, kept, for, himself, the, title, of, foreign, minister, his, most, notable, accomplishment, was, to, obtain, from, britain, the, return, of, napoleon, s, ashes, from, saint, helena, the, idea, was, particularly, pleasing, to, thiers, because, he, had, just, begun, writing, a, history, of, the, consulate, and, empire, in, twenty, volumes, rather, than, making, the, request, public, he, wrote, to, a, personal, english, friend, lord, clarendon, who, was, a, member, of, the, british, government, saying, to, keep, a, cadaver, as, a, prisoner, is, not, worthy, of, you, nor, is, it, possible, on, the, part, of, a, government, such, as, yours, the, restitution, of, these, remains, is, the, final, act, of, putting, behind, us, the, fifty, years, that, have, passed, and, will, be, the, seal, placed, on, our, reconciliation, and, our, close, alliance, the, british, prime, minister, lord, palmerston, considered, and, accepted, the, request, the, transfer, was, opposed, by, some, in, the, french, parliament, including, lamartine, who, feared, that, it, would, stir, republican, sentiment, in, france, but, it, was, welcomed, by, the, population, a, warship, was, dispatched, to, saint, helena, and, thiers, worked, on, the, details, of, the, design, of, the, tomb, and, the, plan, of, the, parade, that, would, carry, it, to, the, tomb, constructed, within, les, invalides, the, return, of, the, ashes, was, a, huge, success, attracting, enormous, crowds, in, paris, but, by, the, time, it, took, place, thiers, was, no, longer, in, the, government, more, unexpected, news, arrived, on, 5, august, while, the, remains, of, napoleon, were, still, en, route, from, st, helena, to, paris, louis, napoleon, the, nephew, of, the, emperor, had, landed, at, boulogne, with, a, small, force, of, soldiers, and, had, tried, to, spark, an, uprising, by, the, army, to, overthrow, louis, philippe, the, soldiers, in, boulogne, refused, to, change, sides, louis, napoleon, was, captured, taken, to, the, conciergerie, in, paris, and, put, on, trial, he, was, sentenced, to, life, in, prison, and, sent, to, serve, his, sentence, to, the, fortress, of, ham, the, year, 1840, also, brought, a, political, crisis, between, france, russia, and, britain, because, of, france, s, support, for, the, ruler, of, egypt, muhammad, ali, a, long, time, ally, in, 1829, he, had, donated, the, luxor, obelisk, now, standing, in, the, place, de, la, concorde, lord, palmerston, was, convinced, that, the, french, would, not, fight, and, sent, a, fleet, to, bombard, beirut, and, threaten, egypt, the, french, cabinet, was, divided, fearing, that, france, was, not, ready, for, war, the, french, army, was, already, engaged, in, the, long, expensive, military, conquest, of, algeria, the, king, made, it, clear, to, thiers, that, he, wanted, peace, thiers, offered, to, resign, but, the, king, refused, his, resignation, arguing, that, he, wanted, the, british, to, believe, that, france, would, fight, when, thiers, drafted, a, note, to, britain, warning, that, a, british, ultimatum, to, egypt, would, upset, the, global, balance, of, power, and, he, ordered, construction, of, a, new, ring, of, fortresses, around, paris, palmerston, did, not, attack, egypt, and, crisis, ended, the, fortifications, begun, by, thiers, during, crisis, were, eventually, finished, and, became, known, as, the, thiers, wall, which, later, became, and, remain, today, the, city, limits, of, paris, after, the, end, of, the, crisis, tensions, remained, between, the, king, and, thiers, who, drafted, the, king, s, annual, address, to, the, chamber, of, deputies, adding, the, line, france, is, strongly, attached, to, peace, but, it, will, not, purchase, peace, at, a, price, unworthy, of, the, nation, and, its, king, and, would, not, sacrifice, the, sacred, independence, and, national, honor, which, the, french, revolution, had, put, into, his, hands, louis, philippe, removed, this, line, from, the, speech, considering, it, too, provocative, to, other, european, rulers, thiers, promptly, offered, his, resignation, and, this, time, it, was, accepted, a, month, later, he, rose, in, parliament, to, denounce, the, king, s, foreign, policy, declaring, that, france, had, lost, its, influence, in, the, middle, east, and, had, a, duty, to, defend, egypt, against, britain, and, turkey, against, russia, once, outside, of, the, government, he, devoted, much, of, his, time, to, writing, histoire, du, consulat, et, de, l, empire, the, first, volume, of, which, appeared, in, 1845, the, book, was, a, huge, success, selling, twenty, thousand, copies, in, a, few, weeks, the, book, was, criticized, by, chateaubriand, who, called, it, an, odious, advertisement, for, bonaparte, edited, in, the, style, of, a, newspaper, it, had, the, unplanned, effect, of, raising, even, further, the, prestige, of, napoleon, s, nephew, and, thiers, future, enemy, louis, napoleon, in, december, 1840, thiers, helped, secure, the, election, of, victor, hugo, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, despite, the, opposition, of, the, more, conservative, members, hugo, was, accepted, only, on, the, fifth, ballot, by, a, single, vote, when, elected, hugo, sent, a, copy, of, his, new, poem, about, napoleon, to, thiers, declaring, to, thiers, that, thiers, was, a, man, i, honor, and, love, your, spirit, is, one, of, those, that, seduces, my, own, one, feels, that, before, you, entered, the, world, of, great, affairs, you, traversed, that, of, great, ideas, with, my, full, sympathy, high, estime, and, vivid, admiration, from, 1840, through, 1844, thiers, traveled, around, europe, crisscrossing, holland, germany, switzerland, and, spain, and, visiting, he, battlefields, where, napoleon, fought, and, meeting, people, who, had, witnessed, them, in, the, meanwhile, his, chief, political, rival, guizot, the, leader, of, the, right, wing, in, the, deputies, headed, the, government, he, called, new, elections, in, july, 1846, which, guizot, s, party, narrowly, won, with, 266, seats, of, 449, however, in, an, ominous, sign, ten, of, the, twelve, deputies, from, paris, opposed, the, government, as, the, king, s, unpopularity, grew, he, suffered, also, a, personal, tragedy, with, great, political, implications, his, son, the, heir, to, the, throne, was, killed, in, an, accident, his, grandson, the, new, heir, was, only, a, child, opposition, to, the, king, continued, to, grow, he, was, the, target, of, two, more, assassination, attempts, in, 1846, in, the, spring, of, 1846, louis, napoleon, disguised, as, a, stonemason, escaped, from, the, prison, at, ham, and, fled, to, england, where, he, waited, for, an, opportunity, to, make, a, grand, return, to, france, thiers, the, leader, of, the, center, left, deputies, began, to, take, a, more, active, part, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, he, told, a, colleague, the, king, is, easily, frightened, he, will, only, call, on, me, when, he, is, in, danger, i, will, only, take, the, ministry, if, i, can, be, the, master, of, it, a, proposal, to, make, a, larger, number, of, citizens, eligible, to, vote, was, rejected, by, guizot, and, his, government, guizot, declared, to, the, chamber, the, day, will, not, come, for, universal, suffrage, the, last, parliamentary, session, of, the, constitutional, monarchy, began, on, 28, december, 1847, with, the, announcement, of, a, military, success, the, resistance, to, french, rule, in, algeria, had, been, defeated, but, immediately, opposition, to, the, government, grew, since, political, meetings, were, forbidden, the, left, opposition, began, to, organize, banquets, large, dinners, in, public, places, which, were, really, opposition, meetings, thiers, declared, to, the, chamber, our, country, is, marching, with, giant, steps, toward, a, catastrophe, there, will, be, a, civil, war, a, revision, of, the, charter, and, perhaps, a, change, of, personnel, at, the, highest, level, if, napoleon, ii, were, alive, he, would, take, the, place, of, the, present, king, the, left, opposition, declared, that, they, would, hold, an, enormous, banquet, on, the, place, de, la, madeleine, on, 22, february, fearing, trouble, guizot, declared, the, banquet, illegal, and, ammunition, was, given, to, the, army, garrison, and, they, prepared, for, trouble, thiers, believing, that, the, government, was, too, strong, to, allow, an, uprising, advised,

of, ammunition, and, exhausted, during, the, night, more, barricades, had, appeared, all, over, paris, thiers, proposed, withdrawing, the, army, to, saint, cloud, gathering, his, forces, and,

the, republic, thiers, fled, on, foot, and, made, his, way, back, to, his, house, a, new, government, was, quickly, formed, by, the, republicans, lamartine, and, ledru, rollin, but, thiers, had, no, part, in, it, the, new, interim, government, quickly, decreed, the, freedom, of, the, press, and, freedom, of, assembly, and, called, for, new, parliamentary, elections, in, which, all, men, over,

napoleon, promptly, withdrew, his, candidacy, and, remained, in, london, waiting, for, a, more, opportune, moment, thiers, had, been, considered, a, leftist, republican, in, the, government, of, louis, philippe, but, after, the, political, earthquake, of, the, 1848, revolution, and, the, influx, of, new, deputies, he, appeared, relatively, conservative, while, he, was, out, of, the, assembly, he, published, an, essay, in, defense, of, capitalism, and, private, property, which, won, him, the, support, of, the, french, business, community, and, middle, class, thiers, took, his, seat, as,

and, awkward, speaking, style, persuaded, thiers, and, other, deputies, that, he, was, minus, habens, an, imbecile, this, was, also, the, view, of, ledru, rollin, and, the, socialist, deputies, the, new, assembly, voted, to, hold, elections, for, a, new, president, of, the, republic, the, first, in, which, all, frenchmen, with, residences, could, vote, elections, were, set, for, 10, december, 1848, thiers, considered, running, but, told, falloux, another, deputy, if, i, lost, it, would, be, a, grave, setback, for, the, ideas, of, order, if, i, won, i, would, be, obliged, to, embrace, the, ideas, of, the, republic, and, in, truth, i, am, too, honest, a, lad, to, marry, such, a, bad, woman, instead, he, made, the, major, mistake, of, his, political, career, he, decided, to, support, louis, napoleon, certain, that, he, could, control, him, he, believed, that, louis, napoleon, s, term, would, be, a, failure, which, would, open, the, way, for, thiers, to, run, in, 1852, on, the, eve, of, the, vote, thiers, hosted, louis, napoleon, at, his, home, for, dinner, in, the, december, 1848, elections, the, moderate, republican, lamartine, received, just, 18, 000, votes, the,

philosophy, unlimited, liberty, leads, to, a, barbaric, society, where, the, strong, oppress, the, others, and, only, the, strongest, have, unlimited, liberty, the, liberty, of, one, person, stops, at, the, liberty, of, other, laws, are, born, from, this, principle, and, a, civilized, society, no, one, person, has, it, in, his, power, to, instantly, achieve, the, happiness, of, nations, on, social, issues, he, became, more, conservative, formerly, a, critic, of, the, role, of, the, church, in, education, he, supported, the, falloux, laws, of, 1850, which, established, a, mixture, of, both, catholic, and, public, schools, and, for, the, first, time, required, that, each, commune, of, over, five, hundred, persons, have, a, school, for, girls, the, most, conservative, measure, he, proposed, was, a, change, in, the, electoral, laws, which, required, that, voters, have, lived, in, their, residences, for, at, least, three, years, and, required, a, certain, minimum, income, he, declared, to, the, assembly, our, goal, is, not, to, exclude, the, poor, from, voting, but, to, exclude, the, vile, multitude, those, who, have, handed, over, the, liberty, of, so, many, republics, to, so, many, tyrants, over, the, years, the, law, was, approved, removing, one, third, of, the, voters, in, france, from, the, voting, lists, thiers, did, not, foresee, that, louis, napoleon, elected, by, universal, suffrage, would, later, use, this, law, as, a, weapon, against, the, assembly, to, reinforce, his, own, rule, when, a, friend, of, louis, napoleon, asked, him, if, he, wasn, t, afraid, of, losing, power, without, universal, suffrage, he, replied, not, at, all, when, the, assembly, is, hanging, over, the, precipice, i, will, cut, the, cord, as, 1852, approached, thiers, looked, forward, to, the, end, of, the, term, of, louis, napoleon, under, the, constitution, he, could, not, run, again, thiers, began, looking, for, other, candidates, to, replace, louis, napoleon, perhaps, with, the, duke, of, joinville, from, the, orleans, family, thiers, and, the, other, conservative, leaders, of, the, assembly, also, rebelled, against, the, high, cost, of, louis, napoleon,

s, proposal, won, a, majority, of, the, assembly, but, not, the, two, thirds, required, by, the, constitution, blocked, by, the, national, assembly, louis, napoleon, decided, to, take, a, different, route, in, public, he, blamed, thiers, and, the, assembly, for, restricting, the, right, to, vote, and, for, refusing, to, alter, the, constitution, for, a, second, term, and, secretly, brought, loyal, army, forces, to, paris, early, in, the, morning, of, 2, december, 1851, in, what, became, known, as, the, december, 1851, coup, d, tat, the, army, took, up, positions, in, key, positions, in,

their, seats, thiers, was, uncomfortable, with, this, way, of, speaking, and, his, first, few, speeches, were, failures, but, he, soon, mastered, the, form, on, 11, january, 1864, he, delivered, a, blistering, attack, on, napoleon, s, government, and, listed, the, necessary, liberties, he, said, were, lacking, in, france, security, of, the, citizen, against, violence, from, individuals, or, from, the, arbitrary, use, of, power, liberty, but, not, impunity, for, the, press, free, elections, freedom, of, the, people, s, representatives, and, public, opinion, expressed, by, the, majority, guiding, the, steps, of, the, government, these, are, the, liberties, that, the, people, are, asking, for, today, tomorrow, in, a, tone, very, different, they, may, be, demanding, them, the, speech, made, him, again, a, leading, figure, of, the, opposition, he, was, cheered, by, a, crowd, outside, his, house, when, he, returned, home, in, the, months, that, followed, thiers, criticized, the, emperor, s, costly, and, doomed, expedition, to, conquer, mexico, he, also, condemned, the, emperor, s, principle, of, nationalities, as, applied, in, italy, of, supporting, the, unification, into, one, country, of, small, states, whose, populations, spoke, a, common, language, this, principle, will, lead, thiers, said, one, day, or, the, other, to, a, policy, of, race, which, will, generate, future, wars, on, 3, may, 1866, when, war, seemed, likely, between, prussia, and, austria, over, the, prussian, annexation, of, holstein, thiers, told, the, assembly, if, prussia, is, successful, we, will, see, the, creation, of, a, new, german, empire, the, empire, of, charles, v, which, once, resided, in, vienna, will, now, reside, in, berlin, an, empire, which, will, press, against, our, borders, after, the, crushing, defeat, of, austria, by, prussia, at, the, battle, of, sadowa, thiers, declared, it, was, france, which, was, defeated, at, sadowa, on, 14, march, 1867, he, told, the,

interests, and, as, far, as, spain, is, concerned, never, have, the, pyrenees, been, so, high, we, have, to, secure, an, alliance, with, england, and, rally, the, small, states, this, is, a, modest, policy, but, confirms, with, good, sense, we, cannot, afford, to, commit, another, error, on, economic, policy, he, was, relentlessly, conservative, he, called, for, protectionism, to, defend, french, industry, and, condemned, the, high, cost, of, baron, georges, eug, ne, haussmann, s, rebuilding, of, paris, which, had, reached, 461, million, francs, under, pressure, from, the, assembly, napoleon,

adroitly, managed, a, diplomatic, crisis, over, the, spanish, throne, to, bring, about, a, war, with, france, which, he, was, confident, prussia, would, win, the, press, in, paris, began, clamoring, for, war, and, napoleon, s, marshals, assured, him, that, france, would, win, bismarck, privately, told, his, friends, that, his, declaration, to, the, french, on, the, crisis, had, the, effect, of, a, red, flag, on, a, bull, thiers, knew, bismarck, well, and, saw, clearly, what, he, was, doing, the, prime, minister, mile, ollivier, spoke, to, the, assembly, on, 15, july, saying, that, france, had, done, all, it, could, to, avoid, war, but, now, it, was, inevitable, and, france, was, well, prepared, and, would, win, thiers, rose, to, speak, and, declared, do, you, really, mean, to, say, that, for, a, question, of, form, you, have, decided, to, release, torrents, of, blood, he, demanded, proof, that, prussia, had, really, insulted, france, the, members, of, the, right, wing, parties, jeered, and, hooted, thiers, and, one, deputy, called, out, you, are, the, anti, patriotic, trumpet, of, disaster, thiers, responded, i, find, this, war, extremely, imprudent, more, than, anyone,

appearance, of, the, count, of, chambord, provoked, a, political, crisis, which, worked, to, the, advantage, of, thiers, he, persuaded, the, republicans, that, he, was, the, least, monarchist, of, the, monarchists, and, persuaded, the, monarchists, that, he, was, the, least, republican, of, the, republicans, on, 30, august, 1871, the, assembly, voted, 494, to, 94, to, change, the, title, of, thiers, from, chief, of, the, executive, power, to, president, of, the, republic, under, the, authority, of, the, national, assembly, it, was, a, remarkable, political, achievement, the, third, republic, had, been, created, with, the, votes, of, the, anti, republican, monarchists, in, private, he, was, not, very, kind, to, the, assembly, he, told, a, friend, that, i, have, an, assembly, of, 150, insurgents, and, four, hundred, poltrons, chicken, hearts, one, could, say, that, the, real, founder, of, the, republic, is, the, count, of, chambord, thiers, moved, quickly, to, set, up, a,

of, september, 1871, after, the, payment, of, 1, 5, billion, francs, six, more, departments, were, liberated, but, twelve, were, still, occupied, until, the, debt, could, entirely, be, paid, off, the, sum, amounted, to, one, sixth, of, the, entire, budget, of, the, republic, within, the, assembly, the, republicans, were, gaining, at, the, expense, of, the, constitutional, monarchists, but, they, were, also, divided, into, several, factions, with, thiers, usually, among, the, moderate, republicans, while, l, on, gambetta, led, the, far, left, the, right, was, also, divided, into, factions, some, wishing, a, constitutional, monarchy, under, the, orleanist, count, of, paris, others, under, the, bourbon, count, of, chambord, it, was, a, very, unstable, mixture, early, in, his, presidency, thiers, declared, in, general, the, country, is, wise, but, the, political, parties, are, not, it, is, these, and, only, these, that, we, have, to, fear, it, is, only, these, which, we, have, to, guard, against, thiers, wrote, late, in, his, memoirs, that, he, would, have, preferred, a, constitutional, monarchy, but, he, knew, it, was, impossible, at, that, moment, given, the, strong, majority, of, republicans, and, supporting, a, monarchy, would, have, been, a, violation, of, my, duties, toward, france, i, had, as, my, mission, to, pacify, and, to, prevent, the, conflicts, of, parties, in, january, 1872, in, partial, elections, for, the, national, assembly, victor, hugo, ran, for, a, seat, in, the, national, assembly, for, paris, as, a, radical, republican, against, a,

government, of, thiers, thiers, further, won, the, support, of, the, middle, class, and, businessmen, by, opposing, a, proposed, income, tax, which, he, declared, was, entirely, arbitrary, inspired, by, political, hatreds, and, passions, the, tax, was, rejected, he, was, a, convinced, protectionist, wishing, to, shelter, french, industry, against, free, trade, and, foreign, competition, on, this, issue, he, was, in, a, minority, the, assembly, voted, 367, to, 297, to, reduce, tariffs, on, imported, goods, thiers, offered, his, resignation, which, was, rejected, by, the, assembly, with, only, eight, dissenting, voices, they, insisted, that, he, remain, as, president, thiers, was, an, advocate, of, obligatory, long, military, service, he, pushed, through, a, law, requiring, obligatory, service, of, five, years, for, french, men, to, the, monarchists, he, seemed, more, and, more, like, a, republican, he, told, them, i, found, the, republic, already, made, a, monarchy, is, impossible, because, there, are, three, dynasties, for, a, single, throne, in, 1873, the, monarchists, of, the, assembly, led, by, the, duke, de, broglie, began, looking, for, a, way, to, bring, about, his, downfall, the, primary, goal, of, thiers, in, 1873, was, to, pay, off, the, debt, to, germany, to, liberate, the, last, french, territory, occupied, by, the, germans, france, still, owed, three, billion, francs, more, than, the, national, budget, with, final, payment, due, in, august, 1875, he, made, agreements, with, the, major, fifty, five, banks, of, europe, and, issued, bonds, which, based, on, the, good, credit, of, france, brought, in, more, than, the, amount, required, thiers, signed, a, new, convention, with, germany, on, 15, march, 1873, calling, for, the, germans, to, leave, the, last, four, french, departments, they, held, ardennes, vosges, meurthe, et, moselle, and, meuse, by, july, 1873, two, years, ahead, of, schedule, germany, retained, only, the, fortress, of, verdun, and, the, territory, of, a, radius, of, three, kilometers, around, it, the, national, assembly, voted, a, special, resolution, to, thank, thiers, for, liberating, french, territory, ahead, of, schedule, the, right, wing, deputies, abstained, but, it, passed, with, the, full, support, of, the, republicans, after, the, resolution, passed, thiers, was, congratulated, by, his, longtime, friend, and, ally, jules, simon, now, you, just, have, to, name, a, successor, thiers, responded, but, there, s, no, one, simon, replied, they, have, marshal, macmahon, oh, about, that, thiers, responded, don, t, worry, he, would, never, accept, the, duke, de, broglie, was, carefully, preparing, a, way, to, bring, down, thiers, he, modified, the, rules, of, the, assembly, so, that, the, president, had, the, power, to, veto, laws, passed, by, the, assembly, but, also, requiring, that, the, president, ask, permission, from, the, head, of, the, assembly, before, he, spoke, to, the, body, on, 2, april, the, moderate, republican, president, of, the, assembly, jules, gr, vy, was, forced, to, resign, by, a, personal, scandal, and, was, replaced, by, a, deputy, of, the, center, right, buffet, who, supported, a, constitutional, monarchy, soon, afterwards, on, 27, april, an, election, was, held, in, paris, to, fill, a, vacant, seat, in, the, assembly, both, the, candidate, of, the, monarchists, and, the, moderate, republican, candidate, supported, by, thiers, was, defeated, by, a, more, radical, republican, named, barodet, who, was, supported, by, l, on, gambetta, and, the, left, wing, of, the, republicans, further, elections, were, held, on, 11, may, five, of, the, six, open, seats, were, won, by, republicans, the, right, wing, of, the, assembly, became, alarmed, that, the, country, was, moving, too, far, to, the, left, and, decided, it, was, time, to, get, rid, of, thiers, the, duke, de, broglie, turned, to, marshal, macmahon, a, veteran, soldier, who, had, defeated, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, magenta, had, been, wounded, fighting, the, germans, and, had, defeated, the, commune, macmahon, declined, at, first, but, as, broglie, persisted, he, said, that, he, had, no, political, ambitions, but, that, if, thiers, retired, he, did, not, want, to, leave, france, without, a, government, in, the, parliamentary, debate, that, soon, followed, thiers, declared, of, course, i, am, for, a, republic, outside, of, a, republic, there, is, nothing, but, chaos, thiers, was, immediately, supported, by, gambetta, leader, of, the, left, republicans, who, said, thiers, is, the, best, shield, against, the, monarchists, in, the, assembly, his, ally, jules, simon, warned, him, you, irritate, the, left, but, you, don, t, appease, the, right, but, thiers, was, confident, of, victory, he, told, simon, i, have, the, popularity, the, country, is, with, me, thiers, proposed, a, new, cabinet, but, de, broglie, and, the, right, wing, objected, that, the, new, government, was, not, conservative, enough, a, debate, and, vote, of, confidence, in, his, government, was, scheduled, for, 23, may, the, diplomatic, corps, was, in, the, audience, along, with, the, thiers, family, and, marshal, macmahon, in, civilian, clothes, de, broglie, began, the, debate, warning, that, the, country, needed, a, firm, government, of, the, right, because, without, it, the, radical, party, which, had, never, repudiated, the, commune, would, win, posterity, is, merciless, he, said, to, governments, and, ministers, who, by, weakness, surrender, to, the, enemy, the, laws, and, societies, they, are, charged, to, defend, under, the, new, rules, of, the, assembly, thiers, as, president, was, not, allowed, to, respond, directly, on, the, floor, of, the, assembly, however, he, demanded, and, received, the, right, to, reply, he, spoke, emotionally, at, length, explaining, that, he, a, longtime, supporter, of, the, monarchy, had, decided, that, considering, the, way, of, things, today, in, the, civilized, world, for, you, and, me, in, practice, a, monarchy, is, absolutely, impossible, he, described, accomplishments, and, policies, and, concluded, what, i, am, describing, is, a, policy, of, conservatism, the, path, of, our, policy, is, the, policy, between, two, extremes, the, assembly, then, voted, resulting, in, a, declaration, of, no, confidence, in, the, thiers, government, by, a, vote, of, 362, to, 348, the, next, day, on, 24, may, thiers, submitted, his, resignation, as, president, the, same, day, the, assembly, voted, to, replace, thiers,

he, spoke, only, once, on, 27, march, 1874, against, a, proposal, to, build, more, forts, around, paris, rather, than, making, paris, a, battlefield, again, thiers, preferred, using, the, money, to, add, more, soldiers, to, the, army, despite, his, opposition, the, measure, was, passed, by, the, conservative, government, thiers, did, have, the, satisfaction, of, seeing, de, broglie, fail, in,

emilie, married, another, man, two, years, later, not, long, after, he, arrived, in, paris, thiers, met, eurydice, dosne, the, wife, of, a, wealthy, businessman, and, real, estate, speculator, when, she, met, thiers, she, had, been, married, fifteen, years, and, had, two, children, she, was, just, three, years, older, than, thiers, they, became, very, close, and, it, is, very, probable, that, she, became, his, mistress, her, husband, provided, important, financial, support, to, thiers, throughout, his, political, career, on, 7, november, 1833, thiers, married, her, daughter, elise, dosne, who, was, sixteen, years, old, twenty, years, younger, than, thiers, the, wedding, allowed, thiers, to, pay, off, his, debts, and, to, buy, the, house, on, place, saint, georges, his, enemies, claimed, that, his, new, wife, was, his, own, daughter, but, elise, was, born, while, thiers, was, still, a, law, student, in, aix, en, provence, thiers, attended, all, official, events, accompanied, by, both, his, wife, and, his, mother, in, law, whom, he, called, my, ladies, mes, dames, this, offended, the, aristocratic, society, of, paris, who, considered, thiers, even, as, a, government, minister, a, social, climber, and, parvenu, in, the, earlier, part, of, his, life, in, paris, thiers, like, other, political, and, literary, figures, of, the, time, had, several, mistresses, he, was, involved, in, one, minor, scandal, in, the, summer, of, 1835, when, he, was, married, minister, of, the, interior, and, member, of, the, academie, fran, aise, he, and, several, ministers, of, government, officials, had, a, very, rowdy, party, at, the, chateau, of, grandvaux, outside, paris, one, group, of, ministers, intoxicated, formed, a, chorus, and, serenaded, thiers, outside, his, window, he, opened, the, window, and, showed, them, his, rear, end, reports, of, the, event, soon, appeared, in, the, press, in, france, and, across, europe, and, did, not, improve, thiers, reputation, with, the, paris, aristocracy, in, appearance, thiers, was, very, short, barely, appearing, over, the, tribune, in, the, assembly, it, was, lowered, slightly, when, he, became, president, to, make, him, more, visible, his, voice, was, harsh, and, he, spoke, with, a, pronounced, proven, al, accent, despite, this, after, a, great, deal, of, practice, he, developed, a, conversational, direct, style, and, became, a, very, effective, public, speaker, his, opponents, tried, every, way, they, could, to, prevent, him, from, speaking, with, little, success, thiers, was, just, one, example, of, 19th, century, french, writers, who, also, had, prominent, political, careers, others, were, victor, hugo, alphonse, de, lamartine, and, alexis, de, tocqueville, but, thiers, was, the, only, writer, who, reached, the, highest, level, of, the, french, state, his, major, literary, works, were, his, ten, volume, history, of, the, french, revolution, and, his, twenty, volume, history, of, the, following, period, the, consulate, and, empire, of, napoleon, i, both, works, were, filled, with, thiers, personal, opinions, and, judgments, but, also, benefited, from, his, personal, access, to, many, of, the, participants, including, his, political, mentor, talleyrand, and, napoleon, s, surviving, generals, the, first, work, on, the, french, revolution, published, between, 1823, and, 1827, was, highly, praised, by, french, critics, it, was, the, first, major, history, in, french, of, the, revolution, and, won, thiers, a, seat, as, the, second, youngest, elected, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, and, in, addition, was, a, major, commercial, success, it, condemned, the, violence, of, the, terror, and, the, most, radical, leaders, including, marat, robespierre, and, saint, just, and, glorified, the, ideals, and, the, more, moderate, leaders, of, the, french, revolution, including, mirabeau, bailly, and, lafayette, though, at, the, time, the, book, was, published, france, was, still, a, monarchy, and, the, singing, of, the, marseillaise, was, still, forbidden, the, books, did, much, to, undermine, public, support, for, the, last, bourbon, king, overthrown, in, the, revolution, of, 1830, his, second, major, work, was, his, enormous, history, of, the, consulate, and, the, empire, in, twenty, volumes, published, between, 1845, and, 1862, like, the, history, of, the, revolution, it, was, a, critical, and, popular, success, in, france, published, at, a, time, when, the, french, public, was, looking, for, heroes, it, sold, 50, 000, complete, sets, of, the, book, an, american, professor, of, french, literature, o, b, super, wrote, a, foreword, to, an, american, edition, of, the, volume, of, thiers, book, on, the, battle, of, waterloo, published, in, 1902, he, wrote, thiers, style, is, characterized, by, brilliant, and, dramatic, descriptions, and, a, liberal, and, tolerant, spirit, but, he, is, at, times, deficient, in, rigorous, historical, accuracy, and, owing, to, the, intense, national, feeling, of, the, writer, his, admiration, for, napoleon, sometimes, gets, the, better, of, his, judgement, thiers, did, more, than, any, other, frenchman, to, keep, alive, in, france, la, l, gende, napol, onienne, which, made, possible, the, second, empire, with, all, its, disastrous, consequences, for, france, thiers, account, of, the, french, invasion, of, russia, was, sharply, criticized, by, leo, tolstoy, for, its, factual, inaccuracies, and, general, high, flown, pompous, style, devoid, of, any, direct, meaning, thiers, also, wrote, a, history, of, the, 1830, revolution, in, which, he, played, an, important, part, and, a, memoir, called, souvenirs, his, speeches, were, collected, by, his, widow, and, published, after, his, death, contemporary, judgements, about, the, place, of, thiers, in, history, depended, largely, upon, the, politics, of, those, doing, the, judging, the, most, virulent, critic, of, thiers, was, certainly, karl, marx, who, had, been, forced, to, leave, paris, when, thiers, was, head, of, the, french, government, in, 1871, he, described, thiers, as, follows, thiers, that, monstrous, gnome, has, charmed, the, french, bourgeoisie, for, almost, half, a, century, because, he, is, the, most, consummate, intellectual, expression, of, their, own, class, corruption, thiers, was, consistent, only, in, his, greed, for, wealth, and, his, hatred, of, the, men, that, produce, it, victor, hugo, lavishly, praised, thiers, when, thiers, supported, him, in, gaining, a, seat, in, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, but, later, when, a, candidate, backed, by, thiers, defeated, hugo, for, a, seat, in, the, assembly, hugo, wrote, i, have, always, felt, for, that, celebrated, statesman, eminent, orator, that, mediocre, writer, that, man, with, a, narrow, and, small, heart, an, undefinable, sentiment, of, admiration, aversion, and, disdain, nonetheless, hugo, along, with, l, on, gambetta, led, the, procession, of, mourners, at, thiers, funeral, thiers, achieved, a, place, in, french, literature, as, the, model, for, eug, ne, de, rastignac, one, of, the, main, characters, in, the, la, com, die, humaine, of, honor, de, balzac, the, character, appears, in, twenty, eight, of, balzac, s, novels, rastignac, s, rapid, rise, from, poverty, to, success, in, finance, and, politics, and, his, unusual, family, life, parallel, those, of, thiers, following, the, death, of, thiers, gustave, flaubert, wrote, about, the, massive, crowds, that, appeared, at, his, funeral, this, truly, national, demonstration, greatly, struck, me, i, did, not, like, this, king, of, the, bourgeois, but, it, doesn, t, matter, compared, with, the, others, who, surrounded, him, he, was, a, giant, and, in, addition, he, had, one, great, virtue, patriotism, no, one, better, summed, up, france, better, than, he, did, that, was, the, reason, for, the, huge, effect, of, his, death, another, historian, maxime, du, camp, wrote, after, thiers, funeral, certainly, people, laughed, at, his, contradictions, and, during, his, lifetime, he, was, not, spared, mockery, but, he, continued, to, be, respected, because, he, passionately, loved, france, in, times, of, good, fortune, he, dreamed, of, a, france, that, was, great, strong, and, respected, and, when, france, was, bent, under, the, weight, of, misfortune, which, its, faults, had, brought, upon, it, he, made, a, superhuman, effort, to, save, it, and, to, make, it, less, miserable, this, pleads, in, his, favor, and, should, earn, him, the, indulgence, of, the, future, the, historian, george, saintsbury, gave, this, assessment, of, thiers, his, constant, tendency, to, inflame, the, aggressive, and, chauvinistic, spirit, of, his, country, was, not, based, on, any, sound, estimate, of, the, relative, power, and, interests, of, france, and, led, his, country, more, than, once, to, the, verge, of, a, great, calamity, in, opposition, both, under, louis, philippe, and, under, the, empire, and, even, to, some, extent, in, the, last, four, years, of, his, life, his, worst, qualities, were, always, evident, but, with, all, these, drawbacks, he, conquered, and, will, retain, a, place, in, what, is, perhaps, the, highest, as, it, is, certainly, the, smallest, class, of, statesmen, the, class, of, those, to, whom, their, country, has, had, recourse, in, a, great, disaster, who, have, shown, in, bringing, her, through, that, disaster, with, constancy, courage, devotion, and, skill, and, have, been, rewarded, by, as, much, success, as, the, occasion, permitted, after, the, student, worker, uprising, in, paris, of, may, 1968, and, during, the, presidency, of, the, socialist, fran, ois, mitterrand, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, thiers, reputation, reached, a, low, point, the, new, government, renamed, several, paris, streets, squares, and, metro, station, for, the, revolutionary, leaders, of, the, paris, commune, while, historians, of, the, left, blamed, thiers, for, lack, of, attention, to, social, issues, and, especially, for, the, suppression, of, the, commune, in, 1983, the, historian, ren, de, la, croix, de, castries, summarized, the, career, of, thiers, this, way, thiers, was, essentially, an, ambitious, man, and, an, egoist, he, never, thought, of, anything, except, his, own, career, and, he, imagined, reaching, the, highest, level, he, wanted, to, be, at, the, top, which, from, the, very, beginning, led, him, naturally, to, desire, one, day, to, be, head, of, state, a, dream, that, for, a, long, time, was, not, practical, because, there, was, a, monarchy, or, an, empire, when, he, did, have, a, chance, to, try, in, 1848, he, thought, it, was, more, judicious, to, support, louis, napoleon, it, was, thus, an, extraordinary, circumstance, that, he, could, actually, achieve, his, dream, in, 1871, at, the, age, of, seventy, four, an, age, which, considerably, passed, the, average, life, expectancy, of, that, time, the, work, of, thiers, did, not, include, a, single, social, law, on, this, point, he, was, truly, a, bourgeois, of, the, 19th, century, insensible, to, the, miseries, of, the, working, class, and, not, hesitant, to, open, fire, on, the, masses, when, the, public, order, was, threatened, to, him, belongs, the, glory, of, having, brought, an, end, to, the, german, occupation, and, to, have, given, to, a, humiliated, france, the, desire, to, live, again, but, if, he, earned, admiration, he, did, not, inspire, much, sympathy, thiers, was, nothing, less, than, the, summary, of, french, politics, in, the, 19th, century, the, historian, pierre, guiral, wrote, in, adolphe, thiers, ou, de, la, n, cessite, en, politique, in, 1986, he, was, a, founder, the, washington, of, france, a, man, full, of, weaknesses, but, an, uncontested, patriot, he, expelled, the, prussians, from, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, from, the, july, revolution, when, he, founded, the, journal, called, the, national, to, 1871, when, he, defended, the, nation, against, divisions, which, threatened, to, destroy, it, he, was, national, the, reconstructed, h, tel, thiers, on, place, saint, georges, in, paris, became, after, his, death, the, headquarters, of, the, fondation, dosne, thiers, which, now, is, part, of, institute, of, france, it, contains, his, library, his, archives, and, a, collection, of, personal, effects, it, can, be, consulted, by, requesting, permission, from, the, institute, of, france, the, house, is, also, a, regular, venue, for, concerts, of, chamber, music, thiers, was, responsible, for, the, construction, of, napoleon, s, tomb, at, les, invalides, and, for, the, completion, of, the, column, on, place, vend, me, and, the, arc, de, triomphe, both, of, which, he, dedicated, thiers, also, built, the, ring, of, fortifications, around, paris, known, as, the, thiers, wall, of, which, a, few, traces, can, still, be, seen, the, location, of, the, wall, now, marks, the, city, limits, of, paris, a, small, street, and, square, in, the, 16th, arrondissement, in, paris, are, named, for, thiers, there, are, streets, and, squares, named, for, thiers, in, bordeaux, nancy, tours, fontainebleau, melun, meudon, chaumont, graion, and, his, native, aix, en, provence, and, there, is, a, lyc, e, thiers, in, marseille, there, were, formerly, statues, of, thiers, in, a, number, of, french, towns, including, nancy, and, saint, germain, en, laye, but, some, were, removed, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s
