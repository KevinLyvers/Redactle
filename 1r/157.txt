gian, lorenzo, or, gianlorenzo, bernini, uk, b, r, n, i, n, i, us, b, r, italian, italian, giovanni, lorenzo, 7, december, 1598, 28, november, 1680, was, an, italian, sculptor, and, architect, while, a, major, figure, in, the, world, of, architecture, he, was, more, prominently, the, leading, sculptor, of, his, age, credited, with, creating, the, baroque, style, of, sculpture, as, one, scholar, has, commented, what, shakespeare, is, to, drama, bernini, may, be, to, sculpture, the, first, pan, european, sculptor, whose, name, is, instantaneously, identifiable, with, a, particular, manner, and, vision, and, whose, influence, was, inordinately, powerful, in, addition, he, was, a, painter, mostly, small, canvases, in, oil, and, a, man, of, the, theatre, he, wrote, directed, and, acted, in, plays, mostly, carnival, satires, for, which, he, designed, stage, sets, and, theatrical, machinery, he, produced, designs, as, well, for, a, wide, variety, of, decorative, art, objects, including, lamps, tables, mirrors, and, even, coaches, as, an, architect, and, city, planner, he, designed, secular, buildings, churches, chapels, and, public, squares, as, well, as, massive, works, combining, both, architecture, and, sculpture, especially, elaborate, public, fountains, and, funerary, monuments, and, a, whole, series, of, temporary, structures, in, stucco, and, wood, for, funerals, and, festivals, his, broad, technical, versatility, boundless, compositional, inventiveness, and, sheer, skill, in, manipulating, marble, ensured, that, he, would, be, considered, a, worthy, successor, of, michelangelo, far, outshining, other, sculptors, of, his, generation, his, talent, extended, beyond, the, confines, of, sculpture, to, a, consideration, of, the, setting, in, which, it, would, be, situated, his, ability, to, synthesize, sculpture, painting, and, architecture, into, a, coherent, conceptual, and, visual, whole, has, been, termed, by, the, late, art, historian, irving, lavin, the, unity, of, the, visual, arts, bernini, was, born, on, 7, december, 1598, in, naples, to, angelica, galante, a, neapolitan, and, mannerist, sculptor, pietro, bernini, originally, from, florence, he, was, the, sixth, of, their, thirteen, children, gian, lorenzo, bernini, was, recognized, as, a, prodigy, when, he, was, only, eight, years, old, he, was, consistently, encouraged, by, his, father, pietro, his, precocity, earned, him, the, admiration, and, favour, of, powerful, patrons, who, hailed, him, as, the, michelangelo, of, his, century, more, specifically, it, was, pope, paul, v, who, after, first, attesting, to, the, boy, bernini, s, talent, famously, remarked, this, child, will, be, the, michelangelo, of, his, age, later, repeating, that, prophecy, to, cardinal, maffeo, barberini, the, future, pope, urban, viii, as, domenico, bernini, reports, in, his, biography, of, his, father, in, 1606, his, father, received, a, papal, commission, to, contribute, a, marble, relief, to, the, cappella, paolina, of, santa, maria, maggiore, and, so, moved, from, naples, to, rome, taking, his, entire, family, with, him, and, continuing, in, earnest, the, training, of, his, son, gian, lorenzo, several, extant, works, dating, circa, 1615, 1620, are, by, general, scholarly, consensus, collaborative, efforts, by, both, father, and, son, they, include, the, faun, teased, by, putti, c, 1615, metropolitan, museum, nyc, boy, with, a, dragon, c, 1616, 17, getty, museum, los, angeles, the, aldobrandini, four, seasons, c, 1620, private, collection, and, the, recently, discovered, bust, of, the, savior, 1615, 16, new, york, private, collection, sometime, after, the, arrival, of, the, bernini, family, in, rome, word, about, the, great, talent, of, the, boy, gian, lorenzo, spread, throughout, the, city, and, he, soon, caught, the, attention, of, cardinal, scipione, borghese, nephew, to, the, reigning, pope, paul, v, who, spoke, of, the, boy, genius, to, his, uncle, bernini, was, therefore, presented, before, pope, paul, v, curious, to, see, if, the, stories, about, gian, lorenzo, s, talent, were, true, the, boy, improvised, a, sketch, of, saint, paul, for, the, marvelling, pope, and, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, pope, s, attention, on, this, young, talent, once, he, was, brought, to, rome, he, rarely, left, its, walls, except, much, against, his, will, for, a, five, month, stay, in, paris, in, the, service, of, king, louis, xiv, and, brief, trips, to, nearby, towns, including, civitavecchia, tivoli, and, castelgandolfo, mostly, for, work, related, reasons, rome, was, bernini, s, city, you, are, made, for, rome, said, pope, urban, viii, to, him, and, rome, for, you, it, was, in, this, world, of, 17th, century, rome, and, the, international, religious, political, power, which, resided, there, that, bernini, created, his, greatest, works, bernini, s, works, are, therefore, often, characterized, as, perfect, expressions, of, the, spirit, of, the, assertive, triumphal, but, self, defensive, counter, reformation, catholic, church, certainly, bernini, was, a, man, of, his, times, and, deeply, religious, at, least, later, in, life, but, he, and, his, artistic, production, should, not, be, reduced, simply, to, instruments, of, the, papacy, and, its, political, doctrinal, programs, an, impression, that, is, at, times, communicated, by, the, works, of, the, three, most, eminent, bernini, scholars, of, the, previous, generation, rudolf, wittkower, howard, hibbard, and, irving, lavin, as, tomaso, montanari, s, recent, revisionist, monograph, la, libert, di, bernini, turin, einaudi, 2016, argues, and, franco, mormando, s, anti, hagiographic, biography, bernini, his, life, and, his, rome, chicago, university, of, chicago, press, 2011, illustrates, bernini, and, his, artistic, vision, maintained, a, certain, degree, of, freedom, from, the, mindset, and, mores, of, counter, reformation, roman, catholicism, under, the, patronage, of, the, extravagantly, wealthy, and, most, powerful, cardinal, scipione, borghese, the, young, bernini, rapidly, rose, to, prominence, as, a, sculptor, among, his, early, works, for, the, cardinal, as, an, assistant, in, his, father, s, workshop, would, have, been, small, contributions, to, decorative, pieces, for, the, garden, of, the, villa, borghese, such, as, perhaps, the, allegory, of, autumn, formerly, in, the, hester, diamond, collection, in, new, york, another, small, garden, ornament, work, in, the, galleria, borghese, since, bernini, s, lifetime, the, goat, amalthea, with, the, infant, jupiter, and, a, faun, was, from, 1926, until, 2022, generally, considered, by, scholars, to, be, the, earliest, work, executed, entirely, by, the, young, bernini, himself, despite, the, fact, that, it, is, never, mentioned, in, any, of, the, contemporary, sources, except, for, a, late, reference, 1675, as, a, bernini, work, by, joachim, von, sandrart, a, german, visitor, to, rome, an, attribution, that, was, given, no, credence, until, the, twentieth, century, indeed, the, official, 2022, catalogo, generale, vol, 1, sculture, moderne, cat, 41, of, the, galleria, borghese, edited, by, anna, coliva, former, director, of, the, gallery, formally, removes, the, attribution, to, bernini, completely, on, the, basis, of, both, stylistic, technical, and, historical, documentary, grounds, instead, among, bernini, s, earliest, and, securely, documented, work, is, his, collaboration, on, his, father, s, commission, of, february, 1618, from, cardinal, maffeo, barberini, to, create, four, marble, putti, for, the, barberini, family, chapel, in, the, church, of, sant, andrea, della, valle, the, contract, stipulating, that, his, son, gian, lorenzo, would, assist, in, the, execution, of, the, statues, also, dating, to, 1618, is, a, letter, by, maffeo, barberini, in, rome, to, his, brother, carlo, in, florence, which, mentions, that, he, maffeo, was, thinking, of, asking, the, young, gian, lorenzo, to, finish, one, of, the, statues, left, incomplete, by, michelangelo, then, in, possession, of, michelangelo, s, grandnephew, which, maffeo, was, hoping, to, purchase, a, remarkable, attestation, of, the, great, skill, that, the, young, bernini, was, already, believed, to, possess, although, the, michelangelo, statue, completion, commission, came, to, nought, the, young, bernini, was, shortly, thereafter, in, 1619, commissioned, to, repair, and, complete, a, famous, work, of, antiquity, the, sleeping, hermaphroditus, owned, by, cardinal, scipione, borghese, galleria, borghese, rome, and, later, circa, 1622, restored, the, so, called, ludovisi, ares, museo, nazionale, romano, rome, also, dating, to, this, early, period, are, the, so, called, damned, soul, and, blessed, soul, of, circa, 1619, two, small, marble, busts, which, may, have, been, influenced, by, a, set, of, prints, by, pieter, de, jode, i, or, karel, van, mallery, but, which, were, in, fact, unambiguously, catalogued, in, the, inventory, of, their, first, documented, owner, fernando, de, botinete, y, acevedo, as, depicting, a, nymph, and, a, satyr, a, commonly, paired, duo, in, ancient, sculpture, they, were, not, commissioned, by, nor, ever, belonged, to, either, scipione, borghese, or, as, most, scholarship, erroneously, claims, the, spanish, cleric, pedro, foix, montoya, by, the, time, he, was, twenty, two, bernini, was, considered, talented, enough, to, have, been, given, a, commission, for, a, papal, portrait, the, bust, of, pope, paul, v, now, in, the, j, paul, getty, museum, bernini, s, reputation, however, was, definitively, established, by, four, masterpieces, executed, between, 1619, and, 1625, all, now, displayed, in, the, galleria, borghese, in, rome, to, the, art, historian, rudolf, wittkower, these, four, works, aeneas, anchises, and, ascanius, 1619, the, rape, of, proserpina, 1621, 22, apollo, and, daphne, 1622, 1625, and, david, 1623, 24, inaugurated, a, new, era, in, the, history, of, european, sculpture, it, is, a, view, repeated, by, other, scholars, such, as, howard, hibbard, who, proclaimed, that, in, all, of, the, seventeenth, century, there, were, no, sculptors, or, architects, comparable, to, bernini, adapting, the, classical, grandeur, of, renaissance, sculpture, and, the, dynamic, energy, of, the, mannerist, period, bernini, forged, a, new, distinctly, baroque, conception, for, religious, and, historical, sculpture, powerfully, imbued, with, dramatic, realism, stirring, emotion, and, dynamic, theatrical, compositions, bernini, s, early, sculpture, groups, and, portraits, manifest, a, command, of, the, human, form, in, motion, and, a, technical, sophistication, rivalled, only, by, the, greatest, sculptors, of, classical, antiquity, moreover, bernini, possessed, the, ability, to, depict, highly, dramatic, narratives, with, characters, showing, intense, psychological, states, but, also, to, organize, large, scale, sculptural, works, that, convey, a, magnificent, grandeur, unlike, sculptures, done, by, his, predecessors, these, focus, on, specific, points, of, narrative, tension, in, the, stories, they, are, trying, to, tell, aeneas, and, his, family, fleeing, the, burning, troy, the, instant, that, pluto, finally, grasps, the, hunted, persephone, the, precise, moment, that, apollo, sees, his, beloved, daphne, begin, her, transformation, into, a, tree, they, are, transitory, but, dramatic, powerful, moments, in, each, story, bernini, s, david, is, another, stirring, example, of, this, michelangelo, s, motionless, idealized, david, shows, the, subject, holding, a, rock, in, one, hand, and, a, sling, in, the, other, contemplating, the, battle, similarly, immobile, versions, by, other, renaissance, artists, including, donatello, s, show, the, subject, in, his, triumph, after, the, battle, with, goliath, bernini, illustrates, david, during, his, active, combat, with, the, giant, as, he, twists, his, body, to, catapult, toward, goliath, to, emphasize, these, moments, and, to, ensure, that, they, were, appreciated, by, the, viewer, bernini, designed, the, sculptures, with, a, specific, viewpoint, in, mind, though, he, sculpted, them, fully, in, the, round, their, original, placements, within, the, villa, borghese, were, against, walls, so, that, the, viewers, first, view, was, the, dramatic, moment, of, the, narrative, the, result, of, such, an, approach, is, to, invest, the, sculptures, with, greater, psychological, energy, the, viewer, finds, it, easier, to, gauge, the, state, of, mind, of, the, characters, and, therefore, understands, the, larger, story, at, work, daphne, s, wide, open, mouth, in, fear, and, astonishment, david, biting, his, lip, in, determined, concentration, or, proserpina, desperately, struggling, to, free, herself, this, is, shown, by, how, bernini, portrays, her, braids, coming, undone, which, reveals, her, emotional, distress, in, addition, to, portraying, psychological, realism, they, show, a, greater, concern, for, representing, physical, details, the, tousled, hair, of, pluto, the, pliant, flesh, of, proserpina, or, the, forest, of, leaves, beginning, to, envelop, daphne, all, demonstrate, bernini, s, exactitude, and, delight, for, representing, complex, real, world, textures, in, marble, form, in, 1621, pope, paul, v, borghese, was, succeeded, on, the, throne, of, st, peter, by, another, admiring, friend, of, bernini, s, cardinal, alessandro, ludovisi, who, became, pope, gregory, xv, although, his, reign, was, very, short, he, died, in, 1623, pope, gregory, commissioned, portraits, of, himself, both, in, marble, and, bronze, by, bernini, the, pontiff, also, bestowed, upon, bernini, the, honorific, rank, of, cavaliere, the, title, with, which, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, artist, was, habitually, referred, in, 1623, came, the, ascent, to, the, papal, throne, of, his, aforementioned, friend, and, former, tutor, cardinal, maffeo, barberini, as, pope, urban, viii, and, henceforth, until, urban, s, death, in, 1644, bernini, enjoyed, near, monopolistic, patronage, from, the, barberini, pope, and, family, the, new, pope, urban, is, reported, to, have, remarked, it, is, a, great, fortune, for, you, o, cavaliere, to, see, cardinal, maffeo, barberini, made, pope, but, our, fortune, is, even, greater, to, have, cavalier, bernini, alive, in, our, pontificate, although, he, did, not, fare, as, well, during, the, reign, 1644, 55, of, innocent, x, under, innocent, s, successor, alexander, vii, reigned, 1655, 67, bernini, once, again, gained, pre, eminent, artistic, domination, and, continued, in, the, successive, pontificate, to, be, held, in, high, regard, by, clement, ix, during, his, short, reign, 1667, 69, under, urban, viii, s, patronage, bernini, s, horizons, rapidly, and, widely, broadened, he, was, not, just, producing, sculpture, for, private, residences, but, playing, the, most, significant, artistic, and, engineering, role, on, the, city, stage, as, sculptor, architect, and, urban, planner, his, official, appointments, also, testify, to, this, curator, of, the, papal, art, collection, director, of, the, papal, foundry, at, castel, sant, angelo, commissioner, of, the, fountains, of, piazza, navona, such, positions, gave, bernini, the, opportunity, to, demonstrate, his, versatile, skills, throughout, the, city, to, great, protest, from, older, experienced, master, architects, he, with, virtually, no, architectural, training, to, his, name, was, appointed, architect, of, st, peter, s, in, 1629, upon, the, death, of, carlo, maderno, from, then, on, bernini, s, work, and, artistic, vision, would, be, placed, at, the, symbolic, heart, of, rome, bernini, s, artistic, pre, eminence, under, urban, viii, and, later, under, alexander, vii, meant, he, was, able, to, secure, the, most, important, commissions, in, the, rome, of, his, day, namely, the, various, massive, embellishment, projects, of, the, newly, finished, st, peter, s, basilica, completed, under, pope, paul, v, with, the, addition, of, maderno, s, nave, and, facade, and, finally, re, consecrated, by, pope, urban, viii, on, 18, november, 1626, after, 100, years, of, planning, and, building, within, the, basilica, he, was, responsible, for, the, baldacchino, the, decoration, of, the, four, piers, under, the, cupola, the, cathedra, petri, or, chair, of, st, peter, in, the, apse, the, tomb, of, countess, matilda, of, tuscany, the, chapel, of, the, blessed, sacrament, in, the, right, nave, and, the, decoration, floor, walls, and, arches, of, the, new, nave, the, baldacchino, immediately, became, the, visual, centrepiece, of, the, basilica, designed, as, a, massive, spiraling, gilded, bronze, canopy, over, the, tomb, of, st, peter, bernini, s, four, columned, creation, reached, nearly, 30, m, 98, ft, from, the, ground, and, cost, around, 200, 000, roman, scudi, about, 8, million, us, dollars, in, the, currency, of, the, early, 21st, century, quite, simply, writes, one, art, historian, nothing, like, it, had, ever, been, seen, before, soon, after, the, completion, of, the, baldacchino, bernini, undertook, the, whole, scale, embellishment, of, the, four, massive, piers, at, the, crossing, of, the, basilica, i, e, the, structures, supporting, the, cupola, including, most, notably, four, colossal, theatrically, dramatic, statues, among, the, latter, is, the, majestic, st, longinus, executed, by, bernini, himself, the, other, three, are, by, other, contemporary, sculptors, fran, ois, duquesnoy, francesco, mochi, and, bernini, s, disciple, andrea, bolgi, in, the, basilica, bernini, also, began, work, on, the, tomb, for, urban, viii, completed, only, after, urban, s, death, in, 1644, one, in, a, long, distinguished, series, of, tombs, and, funerary, monuments, for, which, bernini, is, famous, and, a, traditional, genre, upon, which, his, influence, left, an, enduring, mark, often, copied, by, subsequent, artists, indeed, bernini, s, final, and, most, original, tomb, monument, the, tomb, of, pope, alexander, vii, in, st, peter, s, basilica, represents, according, to, erwin, panofsky, the, very, pinnacle, of, european, funerary, art, whose, creative, inventiveness, subsequent, artists, could, not, hope, to, surpass, despite, this, busy, engagement, with, large, works, of, public, architecture, bernini, was, still, able, to, devote, himself, to, his, sculpture, especially, portraits, in, marble, but, also, large, statues, such, as, the, life, size, saint, bibiana, 1624, church, of, santa, bibiana, rome, bernini, s, portraits, show, his, ever, increasing, ability, to, capture, the, utterly, distinctive, personal, characteristics, of, his, sitters, as, well, as, his, ability, to, achieve, in, cold, white, marble, almost, painterly, like, effects, that, render, with, convincing, realism, the, various, surfaces, involved, human, flesh, hair, fabric, of, varying, type, metal, etc, these, portraits, included, a, number, of, busts, of, urban, viii, himself, the, family, bust, of, francesco, barberini, and, most, notably, the, two, busts, of, scipione, borghese, the, second, of, which, had, been, rapidly, created, by, bernini, once, a, flaw, had, been, found, in, the, marble, of, the, first, the, transitory, nature, of, the, expression, on, scipione, s, face, is, often, noted, by, art, historians, as, iconic, of, the, baroque, concern, for, representing, fleeting, movement, in, static, artworks, to, rudolf, wittkower, the, beholder, feels, that, in, the, twinkle, of, an, eye, not, only, might, the, expression, and, attitude, change, but, also, the, folds, of, the, casually, arranged, mantle, other, marble, portraits, in, this, period, include, that, of, costanza, bonarelli, unusual, in, its, more, personal, intimate, nature, at, the, time, of, the, sculpting, of, the, portrait, bernini, was, having, an, affair, with, costanza, wife, of, one, of, his, assistants, sculptor, matteo, indeed, it, would, appear, to, be, the, first, marble, portrait, of, a, non, aristocratic, woman, by, a, major, artist, in, european, history, beginning, in, the, late, 1630s, now, known, in, europe, as, one, of, the, most, accomplished, portraitists, in, marble, bernini, also, began, to, receive, royal, commissions, from, outside, rome, for, subjects, such, as, cardinal, richelieu, of, france, francesco, i, d, este, the, powerful, duke, of, modena, charles, i, of, england, and, his, wife, queen, henrietta, maria, the, bust, of, charles, i, was, produced, in, rome, from, a, triple, portrait, oil, on, canvas, executed, by, van, dyck, that, survives, today, in, the, british, royal, collection, the, bust, of, charles, was, lost, in, the, whitehall, palace, fire, of, 1698, though, its, design, is, known, through, contemporary, copies, and, drawings, and, that, of, henrietta, maria, was, not, undertaken, due, to, the, outbreak, of, the, english, civil, war, in, 1644, with, the, death, of, pope, urban, with, whom, bernini, had, been, so, intimately, connected, and, the, ascent, to, power, of, the, fierce, barberini, enemy, pope, innocent, x, pamphilj, bernini, s, career, suffered, a, major, unprecedented, eclipse, which, was, to, last, four, years, this, had, not, only, to, do, with, innocent, s, anti, barberini, politics, but, also, with, bernini, s, role, in, the, disastrous, project, of, the, new, bell, towers, for, st, peter, s, basilica, designed, and, supervised, entirely, by, bernini, the, infamous, bell, tower, affair, was, to, be, the, biggest, failure, of, his, career, both, professionally, and, financially, in, 1636, eager, to, finally, finish, the, exterior, of, st, peter, s, pope, urban, had, ordered, bernini, to, design, and, build, the, two, long, intended, bell, towers, for, its, facade, the, foundations, of, the, two, towers, had, already, been, designed, and, constructed, namely, the, last, bays, at, either, extremity, of, the, facade, by, carlo, maderno, architect, of, the, nave, and, the, fa, ade, decades, earlier, once, the, first, tower, was, finished, in, 1641, cracks, began, to, appear, in, the, fa, ade, but, curiously, enough, work, nonetheless, continued, on, the, second, tower, and, the, first, storey, was, completed, despite, the, presence, of, the, cracks, work, only, stopped, in, july, 1642, once, the, papal, treasury, had, been, exhausted, by, the, disastrous, wars, of, castro, knowing, that, bernini, could, no, longer, depend, on, the, protection, of, a, favourable, pope, his, enemies, especially, francesco, borromini, raised, a, great, alarm, over, the, cracks, predicting, a, disaster, for, the, whole, basilica, and, placing, the, blame, entirely, on, bernini, the, subsequent, investigations, in, fact, revealed, the, cause, of, the, cracks, as, maderno, s, defective, foundations, and, not, bernini, s, elaborate, design, an, exoneration, later, confirmed, by, the, meticulous, investigation, conducted, in, 1680, under, pope, innocent, xi, nonetheless, bernini, s, opponents, in, rome, succeeded, in, seriously, damaging, the, reputation, of, urban, s, artist, and, in, persuading, pope, innocent, to, order, in, february, 1646, the, complete, demolition, of, both, towers, to, bernini, s, great, humiliation, and, indeed, financial, detriment, in, the, form, of, a, substantial, fine, for, the, failure, of, the, work, after, this, one, of, the, rare, failures, of, his, career, bernini, retreated, into, himself, according, to, his, son, domenico, his, subsequent, unfinished, statue, of, 1647, truth, unveiled, by, time, was, intended, to, be, his, self, consoling, commentary, on, this, affair, expressing, his, faith, that, eventually, time, would, reveal, the, actual, truth, behind, the, story, and, exonerate, him, fully, as, indeed, did, occur, although, he, received, no, personal, commissions, from, innocent, or, the, pamphilj, family, in, the, early, years, of, the, new, papacy, bernini, did, not, lose, his, former, positions, granted, to, him, by, previous, popes, innocent, x, maintained, bernini, in, all, of, the, official, roles, given, to, him, by, urban, including, his, most, prestigious, one, as, architect, of, st, peter, s, under, bernini, s, design, and, direction, work, continued, on, decorating, the, massive, recently, completed, but, still, entirely, unadorned, nave, of, st, peter, s, with, the, addition, of, elaborate, multi, coloured, marble, flooring, marble, facing, on, the, walls, and, pilasters, and, scores, of, stuccoed, statues, and, reliefs, it, is, not, without, reason, that, pope, alexander, vii, once, quipped, if, one, were, to, remove, from, saint, peter, s, everything, that, had, been, made, by, the, cavalier, bernini, that, temple, would, be, stripped, bare, indeed, given, all, of, his, many, and, various, works, within, the, basilica, over, several, decades, it, is, to, bernini, that, is, due, the, lion, s, share, of, responsibility, for, the, final, and, enduring, aesthetic, appearance, and, emotional, impact, of, st, peter, s, he, was, also, allowed, to, continue, to, work, on, urban, viii, s, tomb, despite, innocent, s, antipathy, for, the, barberini, a, few, months, after, completing, urban, s, tomb, in, 1648, bernini, won, through, furtive, manoeuvring, with, the, complicity, of, the, pope, s, sister, in, law, donna, olimpia, the, pamphilj, commission, for, the, prestigious, four, rivers, fountain, on, piazza, navona, marking, the, end, of, his, disgrace, and, the, beginning, a, yet, another, glorious, chapter, in, his, life, if, there, had, been, doubts, over, bernini, s, position, as, rome, s, preeminent, artist, they, were, definitively, removed, by, the, unqualified, success, of, the, marvellously, delightful, and, technically, ingenious, four, rivers, fountain, featuring, a, heavy, ancient, obelisk, placed, over, a, void, created, by, a, cavelike, rock, formation, placed, in, the, centre, of, an, ocean, of, exotic, sea, creatures, bernini, continued, to, receive, commissions, from, pope, innocent, x, and, other, senior, members, of, rome, s, clergy, and, aristocracy, as, well, as, from, exalted, patrons, outside, of, rome, such, as, francesco, d, este, recovering, quickly, from, the, humiliation, of, the, bell, towers, bernini, s, boundless, creativity, continued, as, before, new, types, of, funerary, monument, were, designed, such, as, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, the, seemingly, floating, medallion, hovering, in, the, air, as, it, were, for, the, deceased, nun, maria, raggi, while, chapels, he, designed, such, as, the, raimondi, chapel, in, the, church, of, san, pietro, in, montorio, illustrated, how, bernini, could, use, hidden, lighting, to, help, suggest, divine, intervention, within, the, narratives, he, was, depicting, and, to, add, a, dramatically, theatrical, spotlight, to, enhance, the, main, focus, of, the, space, one, of, the, most, accomplished, and, celebrated, works, to, come, from, bernini, s, hand, in, this, period, was, the, cornaro, family, chapel, in, the, small, carmelite, church, of, santa, maria, della, vittoria, rome, the, cornaro, chapel, inaugurated, in, 1651, showcased, bernini, s, ability, to, integrate, sculpture, architecture, fresco, stucco, and, lighting, into, a, marvellous, whole, bel, composto, to, use, early, biographer, filippo, baldinucci, s, term, to, describe, his, approach, to, architecture, and, thus, create, what, scholar, irving, lavin, has, called, the, unified, work, of, art, the, central, focus, of, the, cornaro, chapel, is, the, ecstasy, of, saint, teresa, depicting, the, so, called, transverberation, of, the, spanish, nun, and, saint, mystic, teresa, of, avila, bernini, presents, the, spectator, with, a, theatrically, vivid, portrait, in, gleaming, white, marble, of, the, swooning, teresa, and, the, quietly, smiling, angel, who, delicately, grips, the, arrow, piercing, the, saint, s, heart, on, either, side, of, the, chapel, the, artist, places, in, what, can, only, strike, the, viewer, as, theatre, boxes, portraits, in, relief, of, various, members, of, the, cornaro, family, the, venetian, family, memorialized, in, the, chapel, including, cardinal, federico, cornaro, who, commissioned, the, chapel, from, bernini, who, are, in, animated, conversation, among, themselves, presumably, about, the, event, taking, place, before, them, the, result, is, a, complex, but, subtly, orchestrated, architectural, environment, providing, the, spiritual, context, a, heavenly, setting, with, a, hidden, source, of, light, that, suggests, to, viewers, the, ultimate, nature, of, this, miraculous, event, nonetheless, during, bernini, s, lifetime, and, in, the, centuries, following, till, this, very, day, bernini, s, saint, teresa, has, been, accused, of, crossing, a, line, of, decency, by, sexualizing, the, visual, depiction, of, the, saint, s, experience, to, a, degree, that, no, artist, before, or, after, bernini, dared, to, do, in, depicting, her, at, an, impossibly, young, chronological, age, as, an, idealized, delicate, beauty, in, a, semi, prostrate, position, with, her, mouth, open, and, her, legs, splayed, apart, her, wimple, coming, undone, with, prominently, displayed, bare, feet, discalced, carmelites, for, modesty, always, wore, sandals, with, heavy, stockings, and, with, the, seraph, undressing, her, by, unnecessarily, parting, her, mantle, to, penetrate, her, heart, with, his, arrow, matters, of, decorum, aside, bernini, s, teresa, was, still, an, artistic, tour, de, force, that, incorporates, all, of, the, multiple, forms, of, visual, art, and, technique, that, bernini, had, at, his, disposal, including, hidden, lighting, thin, gilded, beams, recessive, architectural, space, secret, lens, and, over, twenty, diverse, types, of, colored, marble, these, all, combine, to, create, the, final, artwork, a, perfected, highly, dramatic, and, deeply, satisfying, seamless, ensemble, upon, his, accession, to, the, chair, of, st, peter, pope, alexander, vii, chigi, reigned, 1655, 1667, began, to, implement, his, extremely, ambitious, plan, to, transform, rome, into, a, magnificent, world, capital, by, means, of, systematic, bold, and, costly, urban, planning, in, so, doing, he, brought, to, fruition, the, long, slow, recreation, of, the, urban, glory, of, rome, the, deliberate, campaign, for, the, renovatio, romae, that, had, begun, in, the, fifteenth, century, under, the, renaissance, popes, over, the, course, of, his, pontificate, alexander, commissioned, many, large, scale, architectural, changes, in, the, city, indeed, some, of, the, most, significant, ones, in, the, city, s, recent, history, and, for, years, to, come, choosing, bernini, as, his, principal, collaborator, though, other, architects, especially, pietro, da, cortona, were, also, involved, thus, did, commence, another, extraordinarily, prolific, and, successful, chapter, in, bernini, s, career, bernini, s, major, commissions, during, this, period, include, st, peter, s, square, in, a, previously, broad, irregular, and, completely, unstructured, space, he, created, two, massive, semi, circular, colonnades, each, row, of, which, was, formed, of, four, simple, white, doric, columns, this, resulted, in, an, oval, shape, that, formed, an, inclusive, arena, within, which, any, gathering, of, citizens, pilgrims, and, visitors, could, witness, the, appearance, of, the, pope, either, as, he, appeared, on, the, loggia, on, the, fa, ade, of, st, peter, s, or, at, the, traditional, window, of, the, neighbouring, palazzo, vaticano, to, the, right, of, the, square, in, addition, to, being, logistically, efficient, for, carriages, and, crowds, bernini, s, design, was, completely, in, harmony, with, the, pre, existing, buildings, and, added, to, the, majesty, of, the, basilica, often, likened, to, two, arms, reaching, out, from, the, church, to, embrace, the, waiting, crowd, bernini, s, creation, extended, the, symbolic, greatness, of, the, vatican, area, creating, an, emotionally, thrilling, and, exhilarating, expanse, that, was, architecturally, an, unequivocal, success, elsewhere, within, the, vatican, bernini, created, systematic, rearrangements, and, majestic, embellishment, of, either, empty, or, aesthetically, undistinguished, spaces, that, exist, as, he, designed, them, to, the, present, day, and, have, become, indelible, icons, of, the, splendour, of, the, papal, precincts, within, the, hitherto, unadorned, apse, of, the, basilica, the, cathedra, petri, the, symbolic, throne, of, st, peter, was, rearranged, as, a, monumental, gilded, bronze, extravagance, that, matched, the, baldacchino, created, earlier, in, the, century, bernini, s, complete, reconstruction, of, the, scala, regia, the, stately, papal, stairway, between, st, peters, s, and, the, vatican, palace, was, slightly, less, ostentatious, in, appearance, but, still, taxed, bernini, s, creative, powers, employing, for, example, clever, tricks, of, optical, illusion, to, create, a, seemingly, uniform, totally, functional, but, nonetheless, regally, impressive, stairway, to, connect, two, irregular, buildings, within, an, even, more, irregular, space, not, all, works, during, this, era, were, on, such, a, large, scale, indeed, the, commission, bernini, received, to, build, the, church, of, sant, andrea, al, quirinale, for, the, jesuits, was, relatively, modest, in, physical, size, though, great, in, its, interior, chromatic, splendour, which, bernini, executed, completely, free, of, charge, sant, andrea, shared, with, piazza, san, pietro, unlike, the, complex, geometries, of, his, rival, francesco, borromini, a, focus, on, basic, geometric, shapes, circles, and, ovals, to, create, spiritually, intense, spaces, he, also, designed, the, church, of, santa, maria, assunta, 1662, 65, in, the, town, of, ariccia, with, its, circular, outline, rounded, dome, and, three, arched, portico, reminiscent, of, the, pantheon, in, santa, maria, assunta, as, in, his, church, of, st, thomas, of, villanova, in, castelgandolfo, 1658, 61, bernini, completely, eschewed, the, rich, polychrome, marble, decoration, dramatically, seen, in, sant, andrea, and, the, cornaro, chapel, in, santa, maria, della, vittoria, in, favour, of, an, essentially, white, somewhat, stark, interior, albeit, still, much, adorned, with, stucco, work, and, painted, altarpieces, at, the, end, of, april, 1665, and, still, considered, the, most, important, artist, in, rome, if, indeed, not, in, all, of, europe, bernini, was, forced, by, political, pressure, from, both, the, french, court, and, pope, alexander, vii, to, travel, to, paris, to, work, for, king, louis, xiv, who, required, an, architect, to, complete, work, on, the, royal, palace, of, the, louvre, bernini, would, remain, in, paris, until, mid, october, louis, xiv, assigned, a, member, of, his, court, to, serve, as, bernini, s, translator, tourist, guide, and, overall, companion, paul, fr, art, de, chantelou, who, kept, a, journal, of, bernini, s, visit, that, records, much, of, bernini, s, behaviour, and, utterances, in, paris, the, writer, charles, perrault, who, was, serving, at, this, time, as, an, assistant, to, the, french, controller, general, of, finances, jean, baptiste, colbert, also, provided, a, first, hand, account, of, bernini, s, visit, bernini, was, popular, among, the, crowds, who, gathered, wherever, he, stopped, which, led, him, to, compare, his, itinerary, to, the, travelling, exhibition, of, an, elephant, on, his, walks, in, paris, the, streets, were, lined, with, admiring, crowds, too, but, things, soon, turned, sour, bernini, presented, finished, designs, for, the, east, front, i, e, the, all, important, principal, facade, of, the, entire, palace, of, the, louvre, which, were, ultimately, rejected, albeit, not, formally, until, 1667, well, after, his, departure, from, paris, indeed, the, already, constructed, foundations, for, bernini, s, louvre, addition, were, inaugurated, in, october, 1665, in, an, elaborate, ceremony, with, both, bernini, and, king, louis, in, attendance, it, is, often, stated, in, the, scholarship, on, bernini, that, his, louvre, designs, were, turned, down, because, louis, and, his, finance, minister, jean, baptiste, colbert, considered, them, too, italianate, or, too, baroque, in, style, in, fact, as, franco, mormando, points, out, aesthetics, are, never, mentioned, in, any, of, surviving, memos, by, colbert, or, any, of, the, artistic, advisors, at, the, french, court, the, explicit, reasons, for, the, rejections, were, utilitarian, namely, on, the, level, of, physical, security, and, comfort, e, g, location, of, the, latrines, it, is, also, indisputable, that, there, was, an, interpersonal, conflict, between, bernini, and, the, young, french, king, each, one, feeling, insufficiently, respected, by, the, other, though, his, design, for, the, louvre, went, unbuilt, it, circulated, widely, throughout, europe, by, means, of, engravings, and, its, direct, influence, can, be, seen, in, subsequent, stately, residences, such, as, chatsworth, house, derbyshire, england, seat, of, the, dukes, of, devonshire, other, projects, in, paris, suffered, a, similar, fate, such, as, bernini, s, plans, for, the, bourbon, funerary, chapel, in, the, cathedral, of, saint, denis, and, the, main, altar, of, the, church, of, val, de, gr, ce, done, at, the, request, of, its, patron, the, queen, mother, as, well, as, his, idea, for, a, fountain, for, saint, cloud, the, estate, of, king, louis, s, brother, philippe, with, the, exception, of, chantelou, bernini, failed, to, forge, significant, friendships, at, the, french, court, his, frequent, negative, comments, on, various, aspects, of, french, culture, especially, its, art, and, architecture, did, not, go, down, well, particularly, in, juxtaposition, to, his, praise, for, the, art, and, architecture, of, italy, especially, rome, he, said, that, a, painting, by, guido, reni, the, annunciation, altarpiece, then, in, the, carmelite, convent, now, the, louvre, museum, was, alone, worth, half, of, paris, the, sole, work, remaining, from, his, time, in, paris, is, the, bust, of, louis, xiv, although, he, also, contributed, a, great, deal, to, the, execution, of, the, christ, child, playing, with, a, nail, marble, relief, now, in, the, louvre, by, his, son, paolo, as, a, gift, to, queen, maria, theresa, back, in, rome, bernini, created, a, monumental, equestrian, statue, of, louis, xiv, when, it, finally, reached, paris, in, 1685, five, years, after, the, artist, s, death, the, french, king, found, it, extremely, repugnant, and, wanted, it, destroyed, it, was, instead, re, carved, into, a, representation, of, the, ancient, roman, hero, marcus, curtius, bernini, remained, physically, and, mentally, vigorous, and, active, in, his, profession, until, just, two, weeks, before, his, death, which, came, as, a, result, of, a, stroke, the, pontificate, of, his, old, friend, clement, ix, was, too, short, barely, two, years, to, accomplish, more, than, the, dramatic, refurbishment, by, bernini, of, the, ponte, sant, angelo, while, the, artist, s, elaborate, plan, under, clement, for, a, new, apse, for, the, basilica, of, santa, maria, maggiore, came, to, an, unpleasant, end, in, the, midst, of, public, uproar, over, its, cost, and, the, destruction, of, ancient, mosaics, that, it, entailed, the, last, two, popes, of, bernini, s, life, clement, x, and, innocent, xi, were, both, not, especially, close, or, sympathetic, to, bernini, and, not, particularly, interested, in, financing, works, of, art, and, architecture, especially, given, the, disastrous, conditions, of, the, papal, treasury, the, most, important, commission, by, bernini, executed, entirely, by, him, in, just, six, months, in, 1674, under, clement, x, was, the, statue, of, the, blessed, ludovica, albertoni, another, nun, mystic, the, work, reminiscent, of, bernini, s, ecstasy, of, saint, teresa, is, located, in, the, chapel, dedicated, to, ludovica, remodelled, under, bernini, s, supervision, in, the, trastevere, church, of, san, francesco, a, ripa, whose, fa, ade, was, designed, by, bernini, s, disciple, mattia, de, rossi, in, his, last, two, years, bernini, also, carved, supposedly, for, queen, christina, the, bust, of, the, savior, basilica, of, san, sebastiano, fuori, le, mura, rome, and, supervised, the, restoration, of, the, historic, palazzo, della, cancelleria, a, direct, commission, from, pope, innocent, xi, the, latter, commission, is, an, outstanding, confirmation, of, both, bernini, s, continuing, professional, reputation, and, good, health, of, mind, and, body, even, in, advanced, old, age, inasmuch, as, the, pope, had, chosen, him, over, any, number, of, talented, younger, architects, plentiful, in, rome, for, this, prestigious, and, most, difficult, assignment, since, as, his, son, domenico, points, out, deterioration, of, the, palace, had, advanced, to, such, an, extent, that, the, threat, of, its, imminent, collapse, was, quite, apparent, shortly, after, the, completion, of, the, latter, project, bernini, died, in, his, home, on, 28, november, 1680, and, was, buried, with, little, public, fanfare, in, the, simple, unadorned, bernini, family, vault, along, with, his, parents, in, the, basilica, of, santa, maria, maggiore, though, an, elaborate, funerary, monument, had, once, been, planned, documented, by, a, single, extant, sketch, of, circa, 1670, by, disciple, ludovico, gimignani, it, was, never, built, and, bernini, remained, with, no, permanent, public, acknowledgement, of, his, life, and, career, in, rome, until, 1898, when, on, the, anniversary, of, his, birth, a, simple, plaque, and, small, bust, was, affixed, to, the, face, of, his, home, on, the, via, della, mercede, proclaiming, here, lived, and, died, gianlorenzo, bernini, a, sovereign, of, art, before, whom, reverently, bowed, popes, princes, and, a, multitude, of, peoples, in, the, late, 1630s, bernini, had, an, affair, with, a, married, woman, named, costanza, wife, of, his, workshop, assistant, matteo, bonucelli, also, called, bonarelli, and, sculpted, a, bust, of, her, now, in, the, bargello, florence, during, the, height, of, their, romance, however, at, some, point, costanza, began, at, the, same, time, an, affair, also, with, bernini, s, younger, brother, luigi, who, was, bernini, s, right, hand, man, in, his, studio, when, bernini, found, out, about, costanza, and, his, brother, in, a, fit, of, mad, fury, he, chased, luigi, through, the, streets, of, rome, and, into, the, basilica, of, santa, maria, maggiore, almost, ending, his, life, to, punish, his, unfaithful, mistress, bernini, had, a, servant, go, to, the, house, of, costanza, where, the, servant, slashed, her, face, several, times, with, a, razor, the, servant, was, later, jailed, while, costanza, herself, was, jailed, for, adultery, bernini, himself, was, exonerated, by, the, pope, even, though, he, had, committed, a, crime, in, ordering, the, face, slashing, soon, after, in, may, 1639, at, age, forty, one, bernini, wed, a, twenty, two, year, old, roman, woman, caterina, tezio, in, an, arranged, marriage, under, orders, from, pope, urban, she, had, eleven, children, including, youngest, son, domenico, bernini, who, would, later, be, his, father, s, first, biographer, after, his, never, repeated, episode, of, stalking, and, disfigurement, by, proxy, in, his, subsequent, marriage, bernini, turned, more, sincerely, to, the, practice, of, his, faith, according, to, his, early, official, biographers, luigi, however, once, again, brought, scandal, to, his, family, in, 1670, by, raping, a, young, bernini, workshop, assistant, at, the, construction, site, of, the, constantine, memorial, in, st, peter, s, basilica, during, his, lifetime, bernini, lived, in, various, residences, throughout, the, city, principal, among, them, a, palazzo, right, across, from, santa, maria, maggiore, and, still, extant, at, via, liberiana, 24, while, his, father, was, still, alive, after, his, father, died, in, 1629, bernini, moved, the, clan, to, the, long, ago, demolished, santa, marta, neighbourhood, behind, the, apse, of, st, peter, s, basilica, which, afforded, him, more, convenient, access, to, the, vatican, foundry, and, to, his, working, studio, also, on, the, vatican, site, in, 1639, bernini, bought, property, on, the, corner, of, the, via, della, mercede, and, the, via, del, collegio, di, propaganda, fide, in, rome, this, gave, him, the, distinction, of, being, only, one, of, two, artists, the, other, is, pietro, da, cortona, to, be, the, proprietor, of, his, own, large, palatial, though, not, sumptuous, residence, furnished, as, well, with, its, own, water, supply, bernini, refurbished, and, expanded, the, existing, palazzo, on, the, via, della, mercede, site, at, what, are, now, nos, 11, and, 12, the, building, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, palazzo, bernini, but, that, title, more, properly, pertains, to, the, bernini, family, s, later, and, larger, home, on, via, del, corso, to, which, they, moved, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, now, known, as, the, palazzo, manfroni, bernini, bernini, lived, at, no, 11, extensively, remodelled, in, the, 19th, century, where, his, working, studio, was, located, as, well, as, a, large, collection, of, works, of, art, his, own, and, those, of, other, artists, it, is, imagined, that, it, must, have, been, galling, for, bernini, to, witness, through, the, windows, of, his, dwelling, the, construction, of, the, tower, and, dome, of, sant, andrea, delle, fratte, by, his, rival, borromini, and, also, the, demolition, of, the, chapel, that, he, bernini, had, designed, at, the, collegio, di, propaganda, fide, which, was, later, replaced, by, borromini, s, chapel, in, 1660, because, the, collegio, required, a, much, larger, chapel, but, there, is, no, documentation, of, this, belief, the, construction, of, sant, andrea, however, was, completed, by, bernini, s, close, disciple, mattia, de, rossi, and, it, contains, to, this, day, the, marble, originals, of, two, of, bernini, s, own, angels, executed, by, the, master, for, the, ponte, sant, angelo, although, he, proved, during, his, long, lifetime, to, be, a, uomo, universale, truly, accomplished, in, so, many, areas, of, artistic, production, like, michelangelo, and, leonardo, da, vinci, before, him, bernini, was, first, and, foremost, a, sculptor, he, was, trained, from, his, earliest, youth, in, that, profession, by, his, sculptor, father, pietro, the, most, recent, and, most, comprehensive, catalogue, raisonn, of, his, works, of, sculpture, compiled, by, maria, grazia, bernardini, bernini, catalogo, delle, sculture, turin, allemandi, 2022, 2, vols, comprises, 143, entries, not, including, those, of, debated, attribution, they, span, bernini, s, entire, productive, life, the, first, securely, attributed, work, dating, to, 1610, 1612, the, marble, portrait, bust, of, bishop, giovanni, battista, santoni, for, his, tomb, monument, in, rome, s, santa, prassede, and, the, last, to, 1679, the, marble, salvator, mundi, bust, basilica, of, san, sebastian, fuori, le, mura, rome, these, many, works, range, in, size, from, small, garden, pieces, of, his, earliest, years, e, g, the, boy, with, a, dragon, 1617, getty, museum, los, angeles, to, colossal, works, such, as, the, saint, longinus, 1629, 38, st, peter, s, basilica, rome, the, majority, are, in, marble, with, other, works, being, in, bronze, most, notably, his, various, papal, portrait, busts, and, the, monumental, statues, adorning, his, baldacchino, 1624, 33, and, cathedra, petri, 1656, 66, in, st, peter, s, basilica, in, virtually, all, cases, bernini, first, produced, numerous, clay, models, as, preparation, for, the, final, product, these, models, are, now, treasured, as, works, of, art, in, themselves, though, regrettably, only, a, minuscule, percentage, have, survived, from, what, must, have, been, a, great, multitude, the, single, largest, sub, group, of, his, sculptural, production, is, represented, by, his, portrait, busts, either, free, standing, or, incorporated, into, larger, funerary, monuments, mostly, of, his, papal, patrons, or, other, ecclesiastical, personages, as, well, as, those, few, secular, potentates, who, could, afford, the, extraordinary, expense, of, commissioning, a, portrait, from, bernini, e, g, king, louis, xiv, 1665, palace, of, versailles, other, large, groups, are, represented, by, his, religious, works, statues, of, biblical, figures, angels, saints, of, the, church, the, crucified, christ, etc, and, his, mythological, figures, either, free, standing, such, as, his, earliest, masterpieces, in, the, galleria, borghese, rome, or, serving, as, ornaments, in, his, complex, fountain, designs, such, as, the, fountain, of, the, four, rivers, 1647, 51, piazza, navona, rome, bernini, s, vast, sculptural, output, can, also, be, categorized, according, to, the, degree, to, which, bernini, himself, contributed, to, both, the, design, and, execution, of, the, final, product, to, wit, some, works, are, entirely, of, his, own, design, and, execution, others, of, his, design, and, partial, but, still, substantial, execution, while, others, of, his, design, but, with, little, or, no, actual, execution, by, bernini, such, as, the, madonna, and, child, carmelite, church, of, saint, joseph, paris, a, further, category, contains, those, works, commissioned, from, bernini, and, fully, credited, to, his, workshop, but, represent, neither, his, direct, design, nor, execution, only, his, signature, stylistic, inspiration, such, as, several, of, the, angels, on, the, ponte, sant, angelo, refurbished, by, bernini, and, all, of, the, saints, atop, the, two, arms, of, the, portico, of, saint, peter, s, square, in, general, the, more, prestigious, the, commission, and, the, earlier, the, commission, in, his, career, the, greater, is, bernini, s, role, in, both, design, and, execution, though, notable, exceptions, exist, to, both, of, these, general, rules, although, his, formal, professional, training, was, as, sculptor, and, his, entrance, into, the, field, of, architecture, not, of, his, own, volition, but, that, of, pope, urban, viii, bernini, had, by, the, end, of, his, life, reached, what, has, proven, to, be, his, enduring, status, as, one, of, the, most, influential, architects, of, seventeenth, century, europe, he, was, certainly, one, of, the, most, prolific, over, the, many, decades, of, his, long, active, life, despite, the, fact, that, he, rarely, left, the, city, of, rome, and, that, all, of, his, works, of, architecture, were, confined, to, the, limits, of, the, papal, capital, or, to, nearby, towns, bernini, s, influence, was, indeed, european, wide, this, is, thanks, both, to, the, many, engravings, that, disseminated, his, ideas, across, the, continent, and, to, the, many, non, italian, students, of, architecture, who, made, long, pilgrimages, to, rome, from, all, corners, of, europe, to, study, and, be, inspired, by, the, ancient, and, modern, masters, bernini, among, them, bernini, s, architectural, works, include, sacred, and, secular, buildings, and, sometimes, their, urban, settings, and, interiors, he, made, adjustments, to, existing, buildings, and, designed, new, constructions, among, his, most, well, known, works, are, st, peter, s, square, 1656, 67, the, piazza, and, colonnades, in, front, of, st, peter, s, basilica, and, the, interior, decoration, of, the, basilica, among, his, secular, works, are, a, number, of, roman, palaces, following, the, death, of, carlo, maderno, he, took, over, the, supervision, of, the, building, works, at, the, palazzo, barberini, from, 1630, on, which, he, worked, with, francesco, borromini, the, palazzo, ludovisi, now, palazzo, montecitorio, started, 1650, and, the, palazzo, chigi, now, palazzo, chigi, odescalchi, started, 1664, his, first, architectural, projects, were, the, creation, of, the, new, fa, ade, and, refurbishment, of, the, interior, of, the, church, of, santa, bibiana, 1624, 26, and, the, st, peter, s, baldachin, 1624, 33, the, bronze, columned, canopy, over, the, high, altar, of, st, peter, s, basilica, in, 1629, and, before, the, baldachin, was, complete, urban, viii, put, him, in, charge, of, all, the, ongoing, architectural, works, in, the, basilica, bestowing, upon, him, the, official, rank, of, architect, of, st, peter, s, however, bernini, fell, out, of, favour, during, the, papacy, of, innocent, x, pamphili, because, of, that, pope, s, already, mentioned, animosity, towards, the, barberini, and, hence, towards, their, clients, including, bernini, and, the, above, described, failure, of, the, bell, towers, designed, and, built, by, bernini, for, st, peter, s, basilica, never, wholly, without, patronage, during, the, pamphili, years, and, never, losing, his, status, as, architect, of, st, peter, s, after, innocent, s, death, in, 1655, bernini, regained, a, major, role, in, the, decoration, of, the, basilica, with, the, pope, alexander, vii, chigi, leading, to, his, design, of, the, piazza, and, colonnade, in, front, of, st, peter, s, further, significant, works, by, bernini, at, the, vatican, include, the, scala, regia, 1663, 66, the, monumental, grand, stairway, entrance, to, the, vatican, palace, and, the, cathedra, petri, the, chair, of, saint, peter, in, the, apse, of, st, peter, s, in, addition, to, the, chapel, of, the, blessed, sacrament, in, the, nave, bernini, did, not, build, many, churches, ex, novo, from, the, ground, up, rather, his, efforts, were, concentrated, on, pre, existing, structures, such, as, the, restored, church, of, santa, bibiana, and, in, particular, st, peter, s, he, fulfilled, three, commissions, for, new, churches, in, rome, and, nearby, small, towns, best, known, is, the, small, but, richly, ornamented, oval, church, of, sant, andrea, al, quirinale, done, beginning, in, 1658, for, the, jesuit, novitiate, representing, one, of, the, rare, works, of, his, hand, with, which, bernini, s, son, domenico, reports, that, his, father, was, truly, and, very, pleased, bernini, also, designed, churches, in, castelgandolfo, san, tommaso, da, villanova, 1658, 1661, and, ariccia, santa, maria, assunta, 1662, 1664, and, was, responsible, for, the, re, modelling, of, the, sanctuary, of, santa, maria, di, galloro, ariccia, endowing, it, with, a, majestic, new, fa, ade, when, bernini, was, invited, to, paris, in, 1665, to, prepare, works, for, louis, xiv, he, presented, designs, for, the, east, fa, ade, of, the, louvre, palace, but, his, projects, were, ultimately, turned, down, in, favour, of, the, more, sober, and, classic, proposals, of, a, committee, consisting, of, three, frenchmen, louis, le, vau, charles, le, brun, and, the, doctor, and, amateur, architect, claude, perrault, signalling, the, waning, influence, of, italian, artistic, hegemony, in, france, bernini, s, projects, were, essentially, rooted, in, the, italian, baroque, urbanist, tradition, of, relating, public, buildings, to, their, settings, often, leading, to, innovative, architectural, expression, in, urban, spaces, like, piazze, or, squares, however, by, this, time, the, french, absolutist, monarchy, now, preferred, the, classicizing, monumental, severity, of, the, louvre, s, facade, no, doubt, with, the, added, political, bonus, that, it, had, been, designed, by, frenchmen, the, final, version, did, however, include, bernini, s, feature, of, a, flat, roof, behind, a, palladian, balustrade, true, to, the, decorative, dynamism, of, baroque, which, loved, the, aesthetic, pleasure, and, emotional, delight, afforded, by, the, sight, and, sound, of, water, in, motion, among, bernini, s, most, gifted, and, applauded, creations, were, his, roman, fountains, which, were, both, utilitarian, public, works, and, personal, monuments, to, their, patrons, papal, or, otherwise, his, first, fountain, the, barcaccia, commissioned, in, 1627, finished, 1629, at, the, foot, of, the, spanish, steps, cleverly, surmounted, a, challenge, that, bernini, was, to, face, in, several, other, fountain, commissions, the, low, water, pressure, in, many, parts, of, rome, roman, fountains, were, all, driven, by, gravity, alone, creating, a, low, lying, flat, boat, that, was, able, to, take, greatest, advantage, of, the, small, amount, of, water, available, another, example, is, the, long, ago, dismantled, woman, drying, her, hair, fountain, that, bernini, created, for, the, no, longer, extant, villa, barberini, ai, bastioni, on, the, edge, of, the, janiculum, hill, overlooking, st, peter, s, basilica, his, other, fountains, include, the, fountain, of, the, triton, or, fontana, del, tritone, in, piazza, barberini, celebrated, in, ottorino, respighi, s, fountains, of, rome, and, the, nearby, barberini, fountain, of, the, bees, the, fontana, delle, api, the, fountain, of, the, four, rivers, or, fontana, dei, quattro, fiumi, in, the, piazza, navona, is, an, exhilarating, masterpiece, of, spectacle, and, political, allegory, in, which, bernini, again, brilliantly, overcame, the, problem, of, the, piazza, s, low, water, pressure, creating, the, illusion, of, an, abundance, of, water, that, in, reality, did, not, exist, an, oft, repeated, but, false, anecdote, tells, that, one, of, the, bernini, s, river, gods, defers, his, gaze, in, disapproval, of, the, fa, ade, of, sant, agnese, in, agone, designed, by, the, talented, but, less, politically, successful, rival, francesco, borromini, impossible, because, the, fountain, was, built, several, years, before, the, fa, ade, of, the, church, was, completed, bernini, also, provided, the, design, for, the, statue, of, the, moor, in, la, fontana, del, moro, in, piazza, navona, 1653, another, major, category, of, bernini, s, activity, was, that, of, the, tomb, monument, a, genre, on, which, his, distinctive, new, style, exercised, a, decisive, and, long, enduring, influence, included, in, this, category, are, his, tombs, for, popes, urban, viii, and, alexander, vii, both, in, st, peter, s, basilica, cardinal, domenico, pimentel, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, rome, design, only, and, matilda, of, canossa, st, peter, s, basilica, related, to, the, tomb, monument, is, the, funerary, memorial, of, which, bernini, executed, several, including, that, most, notably, of, maria, raggi, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, rome, also, of, greatly, innovative, style, and, long, enduring, influence, among, his, smaller, commissions, although, not, mentioned, by, either, of, his, earliest, biographers, baldinucci, or, domenico, bernini, the, elephant, and, obelisk, is, a, sculpture, located, near, the, pantheon, in, the, piazza, della, minerva, in, front, of, the, dominican, church, of, santa, maria, sopra, minerva, pope, alexander, vii, decided, that, he, wanted, a, small, ancient, egyptian, obelisk, that, was, discovered, beneath, the, piazza, to, be, erected, on, the, same, site, and, in, 1665, he, commissioned, bernini, to, create, a, sculpture, to, support, the, obelisk, the, sculpture, of, an, elephant, bearing, the, obelisk, on, its, back, was, executed, by, one, of, bernini, s, students, ercole, ferrata, upon, a, design, by, his, master, and, finished, in, 1667, an, inscription, on, the, base, relates, the, egyptian, goddess, isis, and, the, roman, goddess, minerva, to, the, virgin, mary, who, supposedly, supplanted, those, pagan, goddesses, and, to, whom, the, church, is, dedicated, bernini, s, elephants, are, highly, realistic, as, bernini, had, twice, the, opportunity, to, see, a, live, elephant, don, diego, in, 1630, and, hansken, in, 1655, a, popular, anecdote, concerns, the, elephant, s, smile, to, find, out, why, it, is, smiling, legend, has, it, the, viewer, must, examine, the, rear, end, of, the, animal, and, notice, that, its, muscles, are, tensed, and, its, tail, is, shifted, to, the, left, as, if, it, were, defecating, the, animal, s, rear, is, pointed, directly, at, one, of, the, headquarters, of, the, dominican, order, housing, the, offices, of, its, inquisitors, as, well, as, the, office, of, father, giuseppe, paglia, a, dominican, friar, who, was, one, of, the, main, antagonists, of, bernini, as, a, final, salute, and, last, word, among, his, minor, commissions, for, non, roman, patrons, or, venues, in, 1677, bernini, worked, along, with, ercole, ferrata, to, create, a, fountain, for, the, lisbon, palace, of, the, portuguese, nobleman, lu, s, de, meneses, 3rd, count, of, ericeira, copying, his, earlier, fountains, bernini, supplied, the, design, of, the, fountain, sculpted, by, ferrata, featuring, neptune, with, four, tritons, around, a, basin, the, fountain, has, survived, and, since, 1945, has, been, outside, the, precincts, of, the, gardens, of, the, palace, of, queluz, several, miles, outside, of, lisbon, bernini, would, have, studied, painting, as, a, normal, part, of, his, artistic, training, begun, in, early, adolescence, under, the, guidance, of, his, father, pietro, in, addition, to, some, further, training, in, the, studio, of, the, florentine, painter, cigoli, his, earliest, activity, as, a, painter, was, probably, no, more, than, a, sporadic, diversion, practised, mainly, in, his, youth, until, the, mid, 1620s, that, is, the, beginning, of, the, pontificate, of, pope, urban, viii, reigned, 1623, 1644, who, ordered, bernini, to, study, painting, in, greater, earnest, because, the, pontiff, wanted, him, to, decorate, the, benediction, loggia, of, st, peter, s, the, latter, commission, was, never, executed, most, likely, because, the, required, large, scale, narrative, compositions, were, simply, beyond, bernini, s, ability, as, a, painter, according, to, his, early, biographers, baldinucci, and, domenico, bernini, bernini, completed, at, least, 150, canvases, mostly, in, the, decades, of, the, 1620s, and, 30s, but, currently, there, are, no, more, than, 35, 40, surviving, paintings, that, can, be, confidently, attributed, to, his, hand, the, extant, securely, attributed, works, are, mostly, portraits, seen, close, up, and, set, against, an, empty, background, employing, a, confident, indeed, brilliant, painterly, brushstroke, similar, to, that, of, his, spanish, contemporary, velasquez, free, from, any, trace, of, pedantry, and, a, very, limited, palette, of, mostly, warm, subdued, colours, with, deep, chiaroscuro, his, work, was, immediately, sought, after, by, major, collectors, most, noteworthy, among, these, extant, works, are, several, vividly, penetrating, self, portraits, all, dating, to, the, mid, 1620s, early, 1630s, especially, that, in, the, uffizi, gallery, florence, purchased, during, bernini, s, lifetime, by, cardinal, leopoldo, de, medici, bernini, s, apostles, andrew, and, thomas, in, london, s, national, gallery, is, the, sole, canvas, by, the, artist, whose, attribution, approximate, date, of, execution, circa, 1625, and, provenance, the, barberini, collection, rome, are, securely, known, as, for, bernini, s, drawings, about, 350, still, exist, but, this, represents, a, minuscule, percentage, of, the, drawings, he, would, have, created, in, his, lifetime, these, include, rapid, sketches, relating, to, major, sculptural, or, architectural, commissions, presentation, drawings, given, as, gifts, to, his, patrons, and, aristocratic, friends, and, exquisite, fully, finished, portraits, such, as, those, of, agostino, mascardi, ecole, des, beaux, arts, paris, and, scipione, borghese, and, sisinio, poli, both, in, new, york, s, morgan, library, another, area, of, artistic, endeavour, to, which, bernini, devoted, much, of, his, spare, time, between, major, commissions, and, which, earned, him, further, popular, acclaim, was, that, of, the, theatre, for, many, years, especially, during, the, reign, of, pope, urban, viii, 1623, 44, bernini, created, a, long, series, of, theatrical, productions, in, which, he, simultaneously, served, as, scriptwriter, stage, director, actor, scenographer, and, special, effects, technician, these, plays, were, mostly, carnival, comedies, held, often, in, his, own, home, which, drew, large, audiences, and, much, attention, and, in, which, the, artist, satirized, contemporary, roman, life, especially, court, life, with, his, pungent, witticisms, at, the, same, time, they, also, dazzled, spectators, with, daring, displays, of, special, effects, such, as, the, flooding, of, the, tiber, river, or, a, controlled, but, very, real, fiery, blaze, as, reported, by, his, son, domenico, s, biography, however, although, there, is, much, disparate, scattered, documentation, showing, that, all, of, this, theatrical, work, was, not, simply, a, limited, or, passing, diversion, for, bernini, the, only, extant, remains, of, these, endeavours, are, the, partial, script, of, one, play, and, a, drawing, of, a, sunset, or, sunrise, relating, to, the, creation, of, a, special, effect, on, stage, among, the, many, sculptors, who, worked, under, his, supervision, even, though, most, were, accomplished, masters, in, their, own, right, were, luigi, bernini, stefano, speranza, giuliano, finelli, andrea, bolgi, giacomo, antonio, fancelli, lazzaro, morelli, francesco, baratta, ercole, ferrata, the, frenchman, niccol, sale, giovanni, antonio, mari, antonio, raggi, and, fran, ois, duquesnoy, but, his, most, trusted, right, hand, man, in, sculpture, was, giulio, cartari, while, in, architecture, it, was, mattia, de, rossi, both, of, whom, travelled, to, paris, with, bernini, to, assist, him, in, his, work, there, for, king, louis, xiv, other, architect, disciples, include, giovanni, battista, contini, and, carlo, fontana, while, swedish, architect, nicodemus, tessin, the, younger, who, visited, rome, twice, after, bernini, s, death, was, also, much, influenced, by, him, among, his, rivals, in, architecture, were, above, all, francesco, borromini, and, pietro, da, cortona, early, in, their, careers, they, had, all, worked, at, the, same, time, at, the, palazzo, barberini, initially, under, carlo, maderno, and, following, his, death, under, bernini, later, on, however, they, were, in, competition, for, commissions, and, fierce, rivalries, developed, particularly, between, bernini, and, borromini, in, sculpture, bernini, competed, with, alessandro, algardi, and, fran, ois, duquesnoy, but, they, both, died, decades, earlier, than, bernini, respectively, in, 1654, and, 1643, leaving, bernini, effectively, with, no, sculptor, of, his, same, exalted, status, in, rome, francesco, mochi, can, also, be, included, among, bernini, s, significant, rivals, though, he, was, not, as, accomplished, in, his, art, as, bernini, algardi, or, duquesnoy, there, was, also, a, succession, of, painters, the, so, called, pittori, berniniani, who, working, under, the, master, s, close, guidance, and, at, times, according, to, his, designs, produced, canvases, and, frescos, that, were, integral, components, of, bernini, s, larger, multi, media, works, such, as, churches, and, chapels, carlo, pellegrini, guido, ubaldo, abbatini, frenchman, guillaume, courtois, guglielmo, cortese, known, as, il, borgognone, ludovico, gimignani, and, giovanni, battista, gaulli, who, thanks, to, bernini, was, granted, the, prized, commission, to, fresco, the, vault, of, the, jesuit, mother, church, of, the, ges, by, bernini, s, friend, jesuit, superior, general, giovanni, paolo, oliva, as, far, as, caravaggio, is, concerned, in, all, the, voluminous, bernini, sources, his, name, appears, only, once, this, occurs, in, the, chantelou, diary, in, which, the, french, diarist, claims, that, bernini, agreed, with, his, disparaging, remark, about, caravaggio, specifically, his, fortune, teller, that, had, just, arrived, from, italy, as, a, pamphilj, gift, to, king, louis, xiv, yet, how, much, bernini, really, scorned, caravaggio, s, art, is, a, matter, of, debate, whereas, arguments, have, been, made, in, favour, of, a, strong, influence, of, caravaggio, on, bernini, bernini, would, of, course, have, heard, much, about, caravaggio, and, seen, many, of, his, works, not, only, because, in, rome, at, the, time, such, contact, was, impossible, to, avoid, but, also, because, during, his, own, lifetime, caravaggio, had, come, to, the, favourable, attention, of, bernini, s, own, early, patrons, both, the, borghese, and, the, barberini, indeed, much, like, caravaggio, bernini, often, devised, strikingly, bold, compositions, akin, to, theatrical, tableaux, that, arrest, the, scene, at, its, dramatic, key, moment, such, as, in, his, ecstasy, of, saint, teresa, in, santa, maria, della, vittoria, and, again, much, like, caravaggio, he, made, full, and, skillful, use, of, theatrical, lighting, as, an, important, aesthetic, and, metaphorical, device, in, his, religious, settings, often, employing, hidden, light, sources, that, could, intensify, the, focus, of, religious, worship, or, enhance, the, dramatic, moment, of, a, sculptural, narrative, the, most, important, primary, source, for, the, life, of, bernini, is, the, biography, written, by, his, youngest, son, domenico, entitled, vita, del, cavalier, gio, lorenzo, bernino, published, in, 1713, though, first, compiled, in, the, last, years, of, his, father, s, life, c, 1675, 80, filippo, baldinucci, s, life, of, bernini, was, published, in, 1682, and, a, meticulous, private, journal, the, diary, of, the, cavaliere, bernini, s, visit, to, france, was, kept, by, the, frenchman, paul, fr, art, de, chantelou, during, the, artist, s, four, month, stay, from, june, through, october, 1665, at, the, court, of, king, louis, xiv, also, there, is, a, short, biographical, narrative, the, vita, brevis, of, gian, lorenzo, bernini, written, by, his, eldest, son, monsignor, pietro, filippo, bernini, in, the, mid, 1670s, until, the, late, 20th, century, it, was, generally, believed, that, two, years, after, bernini, s, death, queen, christina, of, sweden, then, living, in, rome, commissioned, filippo, baldinucci, to, write, his, biography, which, was, published, in, florence, in, 1682, however, recent, research, now, strongly, suggests, that, it, was, in, fact, bernini, s, sons, and, specifically, the, eldest, son, mons, pietro, filippo, who, commissioned, the, biography, from, baldinucci, sometime, in, the, late, 1670s, with, the, intent, of, publishing, it, while, their, father, was, still, alive, this, would, mean, that, first, the, commission, did, not, at, all, originate, in, queen, christina, who, would, have, merely, lent, her, name, as, patron, in, order, to, hide, the, fact, that, the, biography, was, coming, directly, from, the, family, and, secondly, that, baldinucci, s, narrative, was, largely, derived, from, some, pre, publication, version, of, domenico, bernini, s, much, longer, biography, of, his, father, as, evidenced, by, the, extremely, large, amount, of, text, repeated, verbatim, there, is, no, other, explanation, otherwise, for, the, massive, amount, of, verbatim, repetition, and, it, is, known, that, baldinucci, routinely, copied, verbatim, material, for, his, artists, biographies, supplied, by, family, and, friends, of, his, subjects, as, the, most, detailed, account, and, the, only, one, coming, directly, from, a, member, of, the, artist, s, immediate, family, domenico, s, biography, despite, having, been, published, later, than, baldinucci, s, therefore, represents, the, earliest, and, more, important, full, length, biographical, source, of, bernini, s, life, even, though, it, idealizes, its, subject, and, whitewashes, a, number, of, less, than, flattering, facts, about, his, life, and, personality, as, one, bernini, scholar, has, summarized, perhaps, the, most, important, result, of, all, of, the, studies, and, research, of, these, past, few, decades, has, been, to, restore, to, bernini, his, status, as, the, great, principal, protagonist, of, baroque, art, the, one, who, was, able, to, create, undisputed, masterpieces, to, interpret, in, an, original, and, genial, fashion, the, new, spiritual, sensibilities, of, the, age, to, give, the, city, of, rome, an, entirely, new, face, and, to, unify, the, language, of, the, times, few, artists, have, had, as, decisive, an, influence, on, the, physical, appearance, and, emotional, tenor, of, a, city, as, bernini, had, on, rome, maintaining, a, controlling, influence, over, all, aspects, of, his, many, and, large, commissions, and, over, those, who, aided, him, in, executing, them, he, was, able, to, carry, out, his, unique, and, harmoniously, uniform, vision, over, decades, of, work, with, his, long, and, productive, life, although, by, the, end, of, bernini, s, life, there, was, in, motion, a, decided, reaction, against, his, brand, of, flamboyant, baroque, the, fact, is, that, sculptors, and, architects, continued, to, study, his, works, and, be, influenced, by, them, for, several, more, decades, nicola, salvi, s, later, trevi, fountain, is, a, prime, example, of, the, enduring, post, mortem, influence, of, bernini, on, the, city, s, landscape, in, the, eighteenth, century, bernini, and, virtually, all, baroque, artists, fell, from, favor, in, the, neoclassical, criticism, of, the, baroque, that, criticism, aimed, above, all, at, the, latter, s, supposedly, extravagant, and, thus, illegitimate, departures, from, the, pristine, sober, models, of, greek, and, roman, antiquity, it, is, only, from, the, late, nineteenth, century, that, art, historical, scholarship, in, seeking, a, more, objective, understanding, of, artistic, output, within, the, specific, cultural, context, in, which, it, was, produced, without, the, a, priori, prejudices, of, neoclassicism, began, to, recognize, bernini, s, achievements, and, slowly, began, to, restore, his, artistic, reputation, however, the, reaction, against, bernini, and, the, too, sensual, and, therefore, decadent, too, emotionally, charged, baroque, in, the, larger, culture, especially, in, non, catholic, countries, of, northern, europe, and, particularly, in, victorian, england, remained, in, effect, until, well, into, the, twentieth, century, most, notable, are, the, public, disparagement, of, bernini, by, francesco, milizia, joshua, reynolds, and, jacob, burkhardt, among, the, influential, 18th, and, 19th, century, figures, who, despised, bernini, s, art, was, also, and, most, prominently, johann, joachim, winckelmann, 1717, 68, considered, by, many, the, father, of, the, modern, discipline, of, art, history, for, the, neo, classicist, winkelmann, the, one, true, laudable, high, style, of, art, was, characterized, by, noble, simplicity, joined, with, a, quiet, grandeur, that, eschewed, any, exuberance, of, emotion, whether, positive, or, negative, as, exemplified, by, ancient, greek, sculpture, the, baroque, bernini, instead, represented, the, opposite, of, this, ideal, and, moreover, according, to, winkelmann, had, been, utterly, corrupted, by, a, vulgar, flattery, of, the, coarse, and, uncultivated, in, attempting, to, render, everything, more, intelligible, to, them, another, major, condemning, voice, is, that, of, colen, campbell, 1676, 1729, who, on, the, very, first, page, of, his, monumental, and, influential, vitruvius, britannicus, london, 1715, introduction, vol, 1, p, 1, singles, out, bernini, and, borromini, as, examples, of, the, utter, degradation, of, post, palladian, architecture, in, italy, with, the, great, palladio, the, great, manner, and, exquisite, taste, of, building, is, lost, for, the, italians, can, no, more, now, relish, the, antique, simplicity, but, are, entirely, employed, in, capricious,
