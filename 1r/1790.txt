johann, peter, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, d, r, k, l, e, german, 13, february, 1805, 5, may, 1859, was, a, german, mathematician, in, number, theory, he, proved, special, cases, of, fermat, s, last, theorem, and, created, analytic, number, theory, in, analysis, he, advanced, the, theory, of, fourier, series, and, was, one, of, the, first, to, give, the, modern, formal, definition, of, a, function, in, mathematical, physics, he, studied, potential, theory, boundary, value, problems, and, heat, diffusion, and, hydrodynamics, although, his, surname, is, lejeune, dirichlet, he, is, commonly, referred, to, by, his, mononym, dirichlet, in, particular, for, results, named, after, him, gustav, lejeune, dirichlet, was, born, on, 13, february, 1805, in, d, ren, a, town, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, which, at, the, time, was, part, of, the, first, french, empire, reverting, to, prussia, after, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, his, father, johann, arnold, lejeune, dirichlet, was, the, postmaster, merchant, and, city, councilor, his, paternal, grandfather, had, come, to, d, ren, from, richelette, or, more, likely, richelle, a, small, community, 5, km, 3, miles, north, east, of, li, ge, in, belgium, from, which, his, surname, lejeune, dirichlet, le, jeune, de, richelette, french, for, the, youth, from, richelette, was, derived, although, his, family, was, not, wealthy, and, he, was, the, youngest, of, seven, children, his, parents, supported, his, education, they, enrolled, him, in, an, elementary, school, and, then, private, school, in, hope, that, he, would, later, become, a, merchant, the, young, dirichlet, who, showed, a, strong, interest, in, mathematics, before, age, 12, persuaded, his, parents, to, allow, him, to, continue, his, studies, in, 1817, they, sent, him, to, the, gymnasium, bonn, under, the, care, of, peter, joseph, elvenich, a, student, his, family, knew, in, 1820, dirichlet, moved, to, the, jesuit, gymnasium, in, cologne, where, his, lessons, with, georg, ohm, helped, widen, his, knowledge, in, mathematics, he, left, the, gymnasium, a, year, later, with, only, a, certificate, as, his, inability, to, speak, fluent, latin, prevented, him, from, earning, the, abitur, dirichlet, again, persuaded, his, parents, to, provide, further, financial, support, for, his, studies, in, mathematics, against, their, wish, for, a, career, in, law, as, germany, provided, little, opportunity, to, study, higher, mathematics, at, the, time, with, only, gauss, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, who, was, nominally, a, professor, of, astronomy, and, anyway, disliked, teaching, dirichlet, decided, to, go, to, paris, in, may, 1822, there, he, attended, classes, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, and, at, the, university, of, paris, learning, mathematics, from, hachette, among, others, while, undertaking, private, study, of, gauss, s, disquisitiones, arithmeticae, a, book, he, kept, close, for, his, entire, life, in, 1823, he, was, recommended, to, general, maximilien, foy, who, hired, him, as, a, private, tutor, to, teach, his, children, german, the, wage, finally, allowing, dirichlet, to, become, independent, from, his, parents, financial, support, his, first, original, research, comprising, part, of, a, proof, of, fermat, s, last, theorem, for, the, case, n, 5, brought, him, immediate, fame, being, the, first, advance, in, the, theorem, since, fermat, s, own, proof, of, the, case, n, 4, and, euler, s, proof, for, n, 3, adrien, marie, legendre, one, of, the, referees, soon, completed, the, proof, for, this, case, dirichlet, completed, his, own, proof, a, short, time, after, legendre, and, a, few, years, later, produced, a, full, proof, for, the, case, n, 14, in, june, 1825, he, was, accepted, to, lecture, on, his, partial, proof, for, the, case, n, 5, at, the, french, academy, of, sciences, an, exceptional, feat, for, a, 20, year, old, student, with, no, degree, his, lecture, at, the, academy, had, also, put, dirichlet, in, close, contact, with, fourier, and, poisson, who, raised, his, interest, in, theoretical, physics, especially, fourier, s, analytic, theory, of, heat, as, general, foy, died, in, november, 1825, and, he, could, not, find, any, paying, position, in, france, dirichlet, had, to, return, to, prussia, fourier, and, poisson, introduced, him, to, alexander, von, humboldt, who, had, been, called, to, join, the, court, of, king, friedrich, wilhelm, iii, humboldt, planning, to, make, berlin, a, center, of, science, and, research, immediately, offered, his, help, to, dirichlet, sending, letters, in, his, favour, to, the, prussian, government, and, to, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, humboldt, also, secured, a, recommendation, letter, from, gauss, who, upon, reading, his, memoir, on, fermat, s, theorem, wrote, with, an, unusual, amount, of, praise, that, dirichlet, showed, excellent, talent, with, the, support, of, humboldt, and, gauss, dirichlet, was, offered, a, teaching, position, at, the, university, of, breslau, however, as, he, had, not, passed, a, doctoral, dissertation, he, submitted, his, memoir, on, the, fermat, theorem, as, a, thesis, to, the, university, of, bonn, again, his, lack, of, fluency, in, latin, rendered, him, unable, to, hold, the, required, public, disputation, of, his, thesis, after, much, discussion, the, university, decided, to, bypass, the, problem, by, awarding, him, an, honorary, doctorate, in, february, 1827, also, the, minister, of, education, granted, him, a, dispensation, for, the, latin, disputation, required, for, the, habilitation, dirichlet, earned, the, habilitation, and, lectured, in, the, 1827, 28, year, as, a, privatdozent, at, breslau, while, in, breslau, dirichlet, continued, his, number, theoretic, research, publishing, important, contributions, to, the, biquadratic, reciprocity, law, which, at, the, time, was, a, focal, point, of, gauss, s, research, alexander, von, humboldt, took, advantage, of, these, new, results, which, had, also, drawn, enthusiastic, praise, from, friedrich, bessel, to, arrange, for, him, the, desired, transfer, to, berlin, given, dirichlet, s, young, age, he, was, 23, years, old, at, the, time, humboldt, was, able, to, get, him, only, a, trial, position, at, the, prussian, military, academy, in, berlin, while, remaining, nominally, employed, by, the, university, of, breslau, the, probation, was, extended, for, three, years, until, the, position, becoming, definite, in, 1831, after, dirichlet, s, move, to, berlin, humboldt, introduced, him, to, the, great, salons, held, by, the, banker, abraham, mendelssohn, bartholdy, and, his, family, their, house, was, a, weekly, gathering, point, for, berlin, artists, and, scientists, including, abraham, s, children, felix, and, fanny, mendelssohn, both, outstanding, musicians, and, the, painter, wilhelm, hensel, fanny, s, husband, dirichlet, showed, great, interest, in, abraham, s, daughter, rebecka, whom, he, married, in, 1832, rebecka, henriette, lejeune, dirichlet, n, e, rebecka, mendelssohn, 11, april, 1811, 1, december, 1858, was, a, granddaughter, of, moses, mendelssohn, and, the, youngest, sister, of, felix, mendelssohn, and, fanny, mendelssohn, rebecka, was, born, in, hamburg, in, 1816, her, parents, arranged, for, her, to, be, baptised, at, which, point, she, took, the, names, rebecka, henriette, mendelssohn, bartholdy, she, became, a, part, of, the, notable, salon, of, her, parents, abraham, mendelssohn, and, his, wife, lea, having, social, contacts, with, the, important, musicians, artists, and, scientists, in, a, highly, creative, period, of, german, intellectual, life, in, 1829, she, sang, a, small, role, in, the, premiere, given, at, the, mendelssohn, house, of, felix, s, singspiel, die, heimkehr, aus, der, fremde, she, later, wrote, my, older, brother, and, sister, stole, my, reputation, as, an, artist, in, any, other, family, i, would, have, been, highly, regarded, as, a, musician, and, perhaps, been, leader, of, a, group, next, to, felix, and, fanny, i, could, not, aspire, to, any, recognition, in, 1832, she, married, dirichlet, who, was, introduced, to, the, mendelssohn, family, by, alexander, von, humboldt, in, 1833, their, first, son, walter, was, born, she, died, in, g, ttingen, in, 1858, as, soon, as, he, came, to, berlin, dirichlet, applied, to, lecture, at, the, university, of, berlin, and, the, education, minister, approved, the, transfer, and, in, 1831, assigned, him, to, the, faculty, of, philosophy, the, faculty, required, him, to, undertake, a, renewed, habilitation, qualification, and, although, dirichlet, wrote, a, habilitationsschrift, as, needed, he, postponed, giving, the, mandatory, lecture, in, latin, for, another, 20, years, until, 1851, as, he, had, not, completed, this, formal, requirement, he, remained, attached, to, the, faculty, with, less, than, full, rights, including, restricted, emoluments, forcing, him, to, keep, in, parallel, his, teaching, position, at, the, military, school, in, 1832, dirichlet, became, a, member, of, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, the, youngest, member, at, only, 27, years, old, dirichlet, had, a, good, reputation, with, students, for, the, clarity, of, his, explanations, and, enjoyed, teaching, especially, as, his, university, lectures, tended, to, be, on, the, more, advanced, topics, in, which, he, was, doing, research, number, theory, he, was, the, first, german, professor, to, give, lectures, on, number, theory, analysis, and, mathematical, physics, he, advised, the, doctoral, theses, of, several, important, german, mathematicians, as, gotthold, eisenstein, leopold, kronecker, rudolf, lipschitz, and, carl, wilhelm, borchardt, while, being, influential, in, the, mathematical, formation, of, many, other, scientists, including, elwin, bruno, christoffel, wilhelm, weber, eduard, heine, ludwig, von, seidel, and, julius, weingarten, at, the, military, academy, dirichlet, managed, to, introduce, differential, and, integral, calculus, in, the, curriculum, raising, the, level, of, scientific, education, there, however, he, gradually, started, feeling, that, his, double, teaching, load, at, the, military, academy, and, at, the, university, was, limiting, the, time, available, for, his, research, while, in, berlin, dirichlet, kept, in, contact, with, other, mathematicians, in, 1829, during, a, trip, he, met, carl, jacobi, at, the, time, professor, of, mathematics, at, k, nigsberg, university, over, the, years, they, kept, meeting, and, corresponding, on, research, matters, in, time, becoming, close, friends, in, 1839, during, a, visit, to, paris, dirichlet, met, joseph, liouville, the, two, mathematicians, becoming, friends, keeping, in, contact, and, even, visiting, each, other, with, the, families, a, few, years, later, in, 1839, jacobi, sent, dirichlet, a, paper, by, ernst, kummer, at, the, time, a, schoolteacher, realizing, kummer, s, potential, they, helped, him, get, elected, in, the, berlin, academy, and, in, 1842, obtained, for, him, a, full, professor, position, at, the, university, of, breslau, in, 1840, kummer, married, ottilie, mendelssohn, a, cousin, of, rebecka, s, in, 1843, when, jacobi, fell, ill, dirichlet, traveled, to, k, nigsberg, to, help, him, then, obtained, for, him, the, assistance, of, king, friedrich, wilhelm, iv, s, personal, physician, when, the, physician, recommended, that, jacobi, spend, some, time, in, italy, dirichlet, joined, him, on, the, trip, together, with, his, family, they, were, accompanied, to, italy, by, ludwig, schl, fli, who, came, as, a, translator, as, he, was, strongly, interested, in, mathematics, both, dirichlet, and, jacobi, lectured, to, him, during, the, trip, and, he, later, became, an, important, mathematician, himself, the, dirichlet, family, extended, their, stay, in, italy, to, 1845, their, daughter, flora, being, born, there, in, 1844, jacobi, moved, to, berlin, as, a, royal, pensioner, their, friendship, becoming, even, closer, in, 1846, when, the, heidelberg, university, tried, to, recruit, dirichlet, jacobi, provided, von, humboldt, the, needed, support, to, obtain, a, doubling, of, dirichlet, s, pay, at, the, university, in, order, to, keep, him, in, berlin, however, even, then, he, was, not, paid, a, full, professor, wage, and, could, not, leave, the, military, academy, holding, liberal, views, dirichlet, and, his, family, supported, the, 1848, revolution, he, even, guarded, with, a, rifle, the, palace, of, the, prince, of, prussia, after, the, revolution, failed, the, military, academy, closed, temporarily, causing, him, a, large, loss, of, income, when, it, reopened, the, environment, became, more, hostile, to, him, as, officers, he, was, teaching, were, expected, to, be, loyal, to, the, constituted, government, some, of, the, press, who, had, not, sided, with, the, revolution, pointed, him, out, as, well, as, jacobi, and, other, liberal, professors, as, the, red, contingent, of, the, staff, in, 1849, dirichlet, participated, together, with, his, friend, jacobi, in, the, jubilee, of, gauss, s, doctorate, despite, dirichlet, s, expertise, and, the, honours, he, received, and, even, though, by, 1851, he, had, finally, completed, all, formal, requirements, for, a, full, professor, the, issue, of, raising, his, pay, at, the, university, still, dragged, on, and, he, was, still, unable, to, leave, the, military, academy, in, 1855, upon, gauss, s, death, the, university, of, g, ttingen, decided, to, call, dirichlet, as, his, successor, given, the, difficulties, faced, in, berlin, he, decided, to, accept, the, offer, and, immediately, moved, to, g, ttingen, with, his, family, kummer, was, called, to, assume, his, position, as, a, professor, of, mathematics, in, berlin, dirichlet, enjoyed, his, time, in, g, ttingen, as, the, lighter, teaching, load, allowed, him, more, time, for, research, and, he, came, into, close, contact, with, the, new, generation, of, researchers, especially, richard, dedekind, and, bernhard, riemann, after, moving, to, g, ttingen, he, was, able, to, obtain, a, small, annual, stipend, for, riemann, to, retain, him, in, the, teaching, staff, there, dedekind, riemann, moritz, cantor, and, alfred, enneper, although, they, had, all, already, earned, their, phds, attended, dirichlet, s, classes, to, study, with, him, dedekind, who, felt, that, there, were, gaps, in, his, mathematics, education, considered, that, the, occasion, to, study, with, dirichlet, made, him, a, new, human, being, he, later, edited, and, published, dirichlet, s, lectures, and, other, results, in, number, theory, under, the, title, vorlesungen, ber, zahlentheorie, lectures, on, number, theory, in, the, summer, of, 1858, during, a, trip, to, montreux, dirichlet, suffered, a, heart, attack, on, 5, may, 1859, he, died, in, g, ttingen, several, months, after, the, death, of, his, wife, rebecka, dirichlet, s, brain, is, preserved, in, the, department, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, along, with, the, brain, of, gauss, the, academy, in, berlin, honored, him, with, a, formal, memorial, speech, presented, by, kummer, in, 1860, and, later, ordered, the, publication, of, his, collected, works, edited, by, kronecker, and, lazarus, fuchs, number, theory, was, dirichlet, s, main, research, interest, a, field, in, which, he, found, several, deep, results, and, in, proving, them, introduced, some, fundamental, tools, many, of, which, were, later, named, after, him, in, 1837, dirichlet, proved, his, theorem, on, arithmetic, progressions, using, concepts, from, mathematical, analysis, to, tackle, an, algebraic, problem, thus, creating, the, branch, of, analytic, number, theory, in, proving, the, theorem, he, introduced, the, dirichlet, characters, and, l, functions, in, that, article, he, also, noted, the, difference, between, the, absolute, and, conditional, convergence, of, series, and, its, impact, in, what, was, later, called, the, riemann, series, theorem, in, 1841, he, generalized, his, arithmetic, progressions, theorem, from, integers, to, the, ring, of, gaussian, integers, z, i, displaystyle, mathbb, z, in, a, couple, of, papers, in, 1838, and, 1839, he, proved, the, first, class, number, formula, for, quadratic, forms, later, refined, by, his, student, kronecker, the, formula, which, jacobi, called, a, result, touching, the, utmost, of, human, acumen, opened, the, way, for, similar, results, regarding, more, general, number, fields, based, on, his, research, of, the, structure, of, the, unit, group, of, quadratic, fields, he, proved, the, dirichlet, unit, theorem, a, fundamental, result, in, algebraic, number, theory, he, first, used, the, pigeonhole, principle, a, basic, counting, argument, in, the, proof, of, a, theorem, in, diophantine, approximation, later, named, after, him, dirichlet, s, approximation, theorem, he, published, important, contributions, to, fermat, s, last, theorem, for, which, he, proved, the, cases, n, 5, and, n, 14, and, to, the, biquadratic, reciprocity, law, the, dirichlet, divisor, problem, for, which, he, found, the, first, results, by, introducing, the, dirichlet, hyperbola, method, is, still, an, unsolved, problem, in, number, theory, despite, later, contributions, by, other, mathematicians, inspired, by, the, work, of, his, mentor, in, paris, dirichlet, published, in, 1829, a, famous, memoir, giving, the, conditions, showing, for, which, functions, the, convergence, of, the, fourier, series, holds, before, dirichlet, s, solution, not, only, fourier, but, also, poisson, and, cauchy, had, tried, unsuccessfully, to, find, a, rigorous, proof, of, convergence, the, memoir, pointed, out, cauchy, s, mistake, and, introduced, dirichlet, s, test, for, the, convergence, of, series, it, also, introduced, the, dirichlet, function, as, an, example, of, a, function, that, is, not, integrable, the, definite, integral, was, still, a, developing, topic, at, the, time, and, in, the, proof, of, the, theorem, for, the, fourier, series, introduced, the, dirichlet, kernel, and, the, dirichlet, integral, dirichlet, also, studied, the, first, boundary, value, problem, for, the, laplace, equation, proving, the, uniqueness, of, the, solution, this, type, of, problem, in, the, theory, of, partial, differential, equations, was, later, named, the, dirichlet, problem, after, him, a, function, satisfying, a, partial, differential, equation, subject, to, the, dirichlet, boundary, conditions, must, have, fixed, values, on, the, boundary, in, the, proof, he, notably, used, the, principle, that, the, solution, is, the, function, that, minimizes, the, so, called, dirichlet, energy, riemann, later, named, this, approach, the, dirichlet, principle, although, he, knew, it, had, also, been, used, by, gauss, and, by, lord, kelvin, while, trying, to, gauge, the, range, of, functions, for, which, convergence, of, the, fourier, series, can, be, shown, dirichlet, defines, a, function, by, the, property, that, to, any, x, there, corresponds, a, single, finite, y, but, then, restricts, his, attention, to, piecewise, continuous, functions, based, on, this, he, is, credited, with, introducing, the, modern, concept, of, a, function, as, opposed, to, the, older, vague, understanding, of, a, function, as, an, analytic, formula, imre, lakatos, cites, hermann, hankel, as, the, early, origin, of, this, attribution, but, disputes, the, claim, saying, that, there, is, ample, evidence, that, he, had, no, idea, of, this, concept, for, instance, when, he, discusses, piecewise, continuous, functions, he, says, that, at, points, of, discontinuity, the, function, has, two, values, dirichlet, also, worked, in, mathematical, physics, lecturing, and, publishing, research, in, potential, theory, including, the, dirichlet, problem, and, dirichlet, principle, mentioned, above, the, theory, of, heat, and, hydrodynamics, he, improved, on, lagrange, s, work, on, conservative, systems, by, showing, that, the, condition, for, equilibrium, is, that, the, potential, energy, is, minimal, dirichlet, also, lectured, on, probability, theory, and, least, squares, introducing, some, original, methods, and, results, in, particular, for, limit, theorems, and, an, improvement, of, laplace, s, method, of, approximation, related, to, the, central, limit, theorem, the, dirichlet, distribution, and, the, dirichlet, process, based, on, the, dirichlet, integral, are, named, after, him, dirichlet, was, elected, as, a, member, of, several, academies, in, 1855, dirichlet, was, awarded, the, civil, class, medal, of, the, pour, le, m, rite, order, at, alexander, von, humboldt, s, recommendation, the, dirichlet, crater, on, the, moon, and, the, 11665, dirichlet, asteroid, are, named, after, him, a, complete, bibliography, of, dirichlet, s, published, works, including, translations, thereof, and, lectures, not, contained, in, the, werke, is, available, in
