signifying, respect, the, asa, di, var, ballad, of, hope, and, the, sidh, gosht, discussion, with, the, siddhas, it, is, part, of, sikh, religious, belief, that, the, spirit, of, nanak, s, sanctity,

bhoi, d, talva, village, present, day, nankana, sahib, punjab, pakistan, in, the, lahore, province, of, the, delhi, sultanate, although, according, to, one, tradition, he, was, born, in, the, indian, month, of, k, rtik, or, november, known, as, kattak, in, punjabi, he, was, born, into, the, khatri, punjabi, clan, like, all, of, the, sikh, gurus, specifically, guru, nanak, was, a, bedi, khatri, most, janamsakhis, birth, stories, or, traditional, biographies, of, nanak, mention, that, he, was, born, on, the, third, day, of, the, bright, lunar, fortnight, in, the, baisakh, month, april, of, samvat, 1526, these, include, the, puratan, traditional, or, ancient, janamsakhi, miharban, janamsakhi, gyan, ratanavali, by, bhai, mani, singh, and, the, vilayat, vali, janamsakhi, gurbilas, patashahi, 6, written, 1718, also, attributed, to, bhai, mani, singh, contradicts, mani, singh, s, janamsakhi, as, it, instead, says, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, the, sikh, records, state, that, nanak, died, on, the, 10th, day, of, the, asauj, month, of, samvat, 1596, 22, september, 1539, ce, at, the, age, of, 70, years, 5, months, and, 7, days, this, further, suggests, that, he, was, born, in, the, month, of, vaisakh, april, not, kattak, november, in, as, late, as, 1815, during, the, reign, of, ranjit, singh, the, festival, commemorating, nanak, s, birthday, was, held, in, april, at, the, place, of, his, birth, known, by, then, as, nankana, sahib, however, the, anniversary, of, nanak, s, birth, the, gurpurab, gur, purab, celebration, subsequently, came, to, be, celebrated, on, the, full, moon, day, of, the, kattak, month, in, november, the, earliest, record, of, such, a, celebration, in, nankana, sahib, is, from, 1868, ce, there, may, be, several, reasons, for, the, adoption, of, the, kattak, birthdate, by, the, sikh, community, for, one, it, may, have, been, the, date, of, nanak, s, enlightenment, or, spiritual, birth, in, 1496, as, suggested, by, the, dabestan, e, mazaheb, some, of, the, sources, that, support, the, katak, birthday, incident, the, bala, janamasakhi, supports, the, kattak, birth, tradition, it, is, the, only, janamsakhi, that, does, bhai, bala, is, said, to, have, obtained, nanak, s, horoscope, from, nanak, s, uncle, lalu, according, to, which, nanak, was, born, on, a, date, corresponding, to, 20, october, 1469, ce, however, this, janamsakhi, was, written, by, handalis, a, sect, of, sikhs, who, followed, a, sikh, convert, known, as, handal, attempting, to, depict, the, founder, as, superior, to, nanak, according, to, a, superstition, prevailing, in, contemporary, northern, india, a, child, born, in, the, kattak, month, was, believed, to, be, weak, and, unlucky, hence, why, the, work, states, that, nanak, was, born, in, that, month, bhai, gurdas, having, written, on, a, full, moon, day, of, the, kattak, month, several, decades, after, nanak, s, death, mentions, that, nanak, had, obtained, omniscience, on, the, same, day, and, it, was, now, the, author, s, turn, to, get, divine, light, according, to, eyewitness, sikh, chronicles, known, as, bhatt, vahis, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, gurbilas, patashahi, 6, written, 1718, attributed, to, bhai, mani, singh, says, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, meham, parkash, written, in, 1776, also, says, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, kesar, singh, chibber, s, bansavalinama, dasan, patashahia, ka, meaning, genealogy, of, the, ten, emperors, written, in, 1769, says, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, as, well, gurpurnali, written, in, 1727, and, guru, tegh, bahadur, malwe, da, safar, written, in, 1716, both, mention, guru, nanank, being, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, nanak, chandrodaya, sanskrit, janamsakhi, from, 1797, and, janam, sakhi, baba, nanak, by, sant, das, chibber, from, the, 18th, century, both, mention, guru, nanak, being, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, gurpur, parkash, granth, written, by, sant, ren, singh, based, on, a, granth, written, by, binod, singh, states, guru, nanak, was, born, on, the, full, moon, of, katak, according, to, max, arthur, macauliffe, 1909, a, hindu, festival, held, in, the, 19th, century, on, kartik, purnima, in, amritsar, attracted, a, large, number, of, sikhs, the, sikh, community, leader, giani, sant, singh, did, not, like, this, thus, starting, a, festival, at, the, sikh, shrine, of, the, golden, temple, on, the, same, day, presenting, it, as, the, birth, anniversary, celebration, of, guru, nanak, macauliffe, also, notes, that, vaisakh, march, april, already, saw, a, number, of, important, festivals, such, as, holi, rama, navami, and, vaisakhi, therefore, people, would, be, busy, in, agricultural, activities, after, the, harvest, festival, of, baisakhi, therefore, holding, nanak, s, birth, anniversary, celebrations, immediately, after, vaisakhi, would, have, resulted, in, thin, attendance, and, therefore, smaller, donations, for, the, sikh, shrines, on, the, other, hand, by, the, kattak, full, moon, day, the, major, hindu, festival, of, diwali, was, already, over, and, the, peasants, who, had, surplus, cash, from, crop, sales, were, able, to, donate, generously, nanak, s, parents, including, father, kalyan, chand, das, bedi, commonly, shortened, to, mehta, kalu, and, mother, mata, tripta, were, both, hindu, khatris, and, employed, as, merchants, his, father, in, particular, was, the, local, patwari, accountant, for, crop, revenue, in, the, village, of, talwandi, nanak, s, paternal, grandfather, was, named, shiv, ram, bedi, and, his, great, grandfather, was, ram, narayan, bedi, according, to, sikh, traditions, the, birth, and, early, years, of, nanak, s, life, were, marked, with, many, events, that, demonstrated, that, nanak, had, been, blessed, with, divine, grace, commentaries, on, his, life, give, details, of, his, blossoming, awareness, from, a, young, age, for, instance, at, the, age, of, five, nanak, is, said, to, have, voiced, interest, in, divine, subjects, at, age, seven, his, father, enrolled, him, at, the, village, school, as, per, custom, notable, lore, recounts, that, as, a, child, nanak, astonished, his, teacher, by, describing, the, implicit, symbolism, of, the, first, letter, of, the, alphabet, resembling, the, mathematical, version, of, one, as, denoting, the, unity, or, oneness, of, god, other, stories, of, his, childhood, refer, to, strange, and, miraculous, events, about, nanak, such, as, the, one, witnessed, by, rai, bular, in, which, the, sleeping, child, s, head, was, shaded, from, the, harsh, sunlight, by, in, one, account, by, the, stationary, shadow, of, a, tree, or, in, another, by, a, venomous, cobra, nanaki, nanak, s, only, sister, was, five, years, older, than, him, in, 1475, she, married, and, moved, to, sultanpur, jai, ram, nanaki, s, husband, was, employed, at, a, modikhana, a, storehouse, for, revenues, collected, in, non, cash, form, in, the, service, of, the, delhi, sultanate, s, lahore, governor, daulat, khan, at, which, ram, would, help, nanak, get, a, job, nanak, moved, to, sultanpur, and, started, working, at, the, modikhana, around, the, age, of, 16, as, a, young, man, nanak, married, sulakhani, daughter, of, m, l, chand, aka, mula, and, chando, ra, i, they, were, married, on, 24, september, 1487, in, the, town, of, batala, and, would, go, on, to, have, two, sons, sri, chand, and, lakhmi, chand, or, lakhmi, das, nanak, lived, in, sultanpur, until, c, 1500, which, would, be, a, formative, time, for, him, as, the, puratan, janamsakhi, suggests, and, in, his, numerous, allusions, to, governmental, structure, in, his, hymns, most, likely, gained, at, this, time, around, the, age, of, 55, nanak, settled, in, kartarpur, living, there, until, his, death, in, september, 1539, during, this, period, he, went, on, short, journeys, to, the, nath, yogi, centre, of, achal, and, the, sufi, centres, of, pakpattan, and, multan, by, the, time, of, his, death, nanak, had, acquired, several, followers, in, the, punjab, region, although, it, is, hard, to, estimate, their, number, based, on, the, extant, historical, evidence, the, followers, of, nanak, were, called, kart, r, s, meaning, the, people, who, belonged, to, the, village, of, kartarpur, by, others, nanak, appointed, bhai, lehna, as, the, successor, guru, renaming, him, as, guru, angad, meaning, one, s, very, own, or, part, of, you, shortly, after, proclaiming, his, successor, nanak, died, on, 22, september, 1539, in, kartarpur, at, the, age, of, 70, according, to, sikh, hagiography, his, body, was, never, found, when, the, quarreling, hindus, and, muslims, tugged, at, the, sheet, covering, his, body, they, found, instead, a, heap, of, flowers, and, so, nanak, s, simple, faith, would, in, course, of, time, flower, into, a, religion, beset, by, its, own, contradictions, and, customary, practices, during, first, quarter, of, the, 16th, century, nanak, went, on, long, udasiya, journeys, for, spiritual, pursuits, a, verse, authored, by, him, states, that, he, visited, several, places, in, nau, khand, the, nine, regions, of, the, earth, presumably, the, major, hindu, and, muslim, pilgrimage, centres, some, modern, accounts, state, that, he, visited, tibet, most, of, south, asia, and, arabia, starting, in, 1496, at, age, 27, when, he, left, his, family, for, a, thirty, year, period, these, claims, include, nanak, s, visit, to, mount, sumeru, of, indian, mythology, as, well, as, mecca, baghdad, achal, batala, and, multan, where, he, would, debate, religious, ideas, with, opposing, groups, these, stories, became, widely, popular, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, and, exist, in, many, versions, in, 1508, nanak, visited, the, sylhet, region, in, bengal, the, janamsakhis, suggest, that, nanak, visited, the, ram, janmabhoomi, temple, in, ayodhya, in, 1510, 11, ce, the, baghdad, inscription, remains, the, basis, of, writing, by, indian, scholars, that, guru, nanak, journeyed, in, the, middle, east, with, some, claiming, he, visited, jerusalem, mecca, vatican, azerbaijan, and, sudan, the, hagiographic, details, are, a, subject, of, dispute, with, modern, scholarship, questioning, the, details, and, authenticity, of, many, claims, for, example, callewaert, and, snell, 1994, state, that, early, sikh, texts, do, not, contain, such, stories, from, when, the, travel, stories, first, appear, in, hagiographic, accounts, of, guru, nanak, centuries, after, his, death, they, continue, to, become, more, sophisticated, as, time, goes, on, with, the, late, phase, puratan, version, describing, four, missionary, journeys, which, differ, from, the, miharban, version, some, of, the, stories, about, guru, nanak, s, extensive, travels, first, appear, in, the, 19th, century, puratan, janamsakhi, though, even, this, version, does, not, mention, nanak, s, travel, to, baghdad, such, embellishments, and, insertion, of, new, stories, according, to, callewaert, and, snell, 1993, closely, parallel, claims, of, miracles, by, islamic, pirs, found, in, sufi, tadhkirahs, of, the, same, era, giving, reason, to, believe, that, these, legends, may, have, been, written, in, a, competition, another, source, of, dispute, has, been, the, baghdad, stone, bearing, an, inscription, in, a, turkish, script, some, interpret, the, inscription, as, saying, baba, nanak, fakir, was, there, in, 1511, 1512, others, read, it, as, saying, 1521, 1522, and, that, he, lived, in, the, middle, east, for, 11, years, away, from, his, family, others, particularly, western, scholars, argue, that, the, stone, inscription, is, from, the, 19th, century, and, the, stone, is, not, a, reliable, evidence, that, nanak, visited, baghdad, in, early, 16th, century, moreover, beyond, the, stone, no, evidence, or, mention, of, his, journey, in, the, middle, east, has, been, found, in, any, other, middle, eastern, textual, or, epigraphical, records, claims, have, been, asserted, of, additional, inscriptions, but, no, one, has, been, able, to, locate, and, verify, them, novel, claims, about, his, travels, as, well, as, claims, such, as, his, body, vanishing, after, his, death, are, also, found, in, later, versions, and, these, are, similar, to, the, miracle, stories, in, sufi, literature, about, their, pirs, other, direct, and, indirect, borrowings, in, the, sikh, janamsakhis, relating, to, legends, around, his, journeys, are, from, hindu, epics, and, puranas, and, buddhist, jataka, stories, the, earliest, biographical, sources, on, nanak, s, life, recognised, today, are, the, janamsakhis, birth, stories, which, recount, the, circumstances, of, his, birth, in, extended, detail, gyan, ratanavali, is, the, janamsakhi, attributed, to, bhai, mani, singh, a, disciple, of, guru, gobind, singh, who, was, approached, by, some, sikhs, with, a, request, that, he, should, prepare, an, authentic, account, of, nanak, s, life, as, such, it, is, said, that, bhai, mani, singh, wrote, his, story, with, the, express, intention, of, correcting, heretical, accounts, of, nanak, one, popular, janamsakhi, was, allegedly, written, by, bhai, bala, a, close, companion, of, nanak, however, the, writing, style, and, language, employed, have, left, scholars, such, as, max, arthur, macauliffe, certain, that, they, were, composed, after, his, death, according, to, such, scholars, there, are, good, reasons, to, doubt, the, claim, that, the, author, was, a, close, companion, of, guru, nanak, and, accompanied, him, on, many, of, his, travels, bhai, gurdas, a, scribe, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, also, wrote, about, nanak, s, life, in, his, vars, odes, which, were, compiled, some, time, after, nanak, s, life, though, are, less, detailed, than, the, janamsakhis, nanak, s, teachings, can, be, found, in, the, sikh, scripture, guru, granth, sahib, as, a, collection, of, verses, recorded, in, gurmukhi, there, are, three, competing, theories, on, nanak, s, teachings, the, first, according, to, cole, and, sambhi, 1995, 1997, based, on, the, hagiographical, janamsakhis, states, that, nanak, s, teachings, and, sikhism, were, revelations, from, god, and, not, a, social, protest, movement, nor, an, attempt, to, reconcile, hinduism, and, islam, in, the, 15th, century, the, second, theory, states, that, nanak, was, a, guru, not, a, prophet, according, to, singha, 2009, sikhism, does, not, subscribe, to, the, theory, of, incarnation, or, the, concept, of, prophet, hood, but, it, has, a, pivotal, concept, of, guru, he, is, not, an, incarnation, of, god, not, even, a, prophet, he, is, an, illumined, soul, the, third, theory, is, that, guru, nanak, is, the, incarnation, of, god, this, has, been, supported, by, many, sikhs, including, bhai, gurdas, bhai, vir, singh, santhok, singh, and, is, supported, by, the, guru, granth, sahib, bhai, gurdas, says, the, guru, and, god, are, one, he, is, the, true, master, and, the, whole, world, craves, for, him, additionally, in, the, guru, granth, sahib, it, is, stated, o, nanak, serve, the, guru, the, lord, incarnate, the, blessed, vision, of, his, darshan, is, profitable, and, in, the, end, you, shall, not, be, called, to, account, 2, guru, ram, das, says, the, guru, is, god, and, god, is, the, guru, o, nanak, there, is, no, difference, between, the, two, o, siblings, of, destiny, 4, 1, 8, the, hagiographical, janamsakhis, were, not, written, by, nanak, but, by, later, followers, without, regard, for, historical, accuracy, containing, numerous, legends, and, myths, created, to, show, respect, for, nanak, in, sikhism, the, term, revelation, as, cole, and, sambhi, clarify, is, not, limited, to, the, teachings, of, nanak, rather, they, include, all, sikh, gurus, as, well, as, the, words, of, men, and, women, from, nanak, s, past, present, and, future, who, possess, divine, knowledge, intuitively, through, meditation, the, sikh, revelations, include, the, words, of, non, sikh, bhagats, hindu, muslim, devotees, some, who, lived, and, died, before, the, birth, of, nanak, and, whose, teachings, are, part, of, the, sikh, scriptures, the, adi, granth, and, successive, sikh, gurus, repeatedly, emphasised, suggests, mandair, 2013, that, sikhism, is, not, about, hearing, voices, from, god, but, it, is, about, changing, the, nature, of, the, human, mind, and, anyone, can, achieve, direct, experience, and, spiritual, perfection, at, any, time, nanak, emphasised, that, all, human, beings, can, have, direct, access, to, god, without, rituals, or, priests, the, concept, of, man, as, elaborated, by, nanak, states, mandair, 2009, refines, and, negates, the, monotheistic, concept, of, self, god, where, monotheism, becomes, almost, redundant, in, the, movement, and, crossings, of, love, the, goal, of, man, taught, the, sikh, gurus, is, to, end, all, dualities, of, self, and, other, i, and, not, i, attaining, the, attendant, balance, of, separation, fusion, self, other, action, inaction, attachment, detachment, in, the, course, of, daily, life, nanak, and, other, sikh, gurus, emphasised, bhakti, love, devotion, or, worship, and, taught, that, the, spiritual, life, and, secular, householder, life, are, intertwined, in, the, sikh, perspective, the, everyday, world, is, part, of, an, infinite, reality, where, increased, spiritual, awareness, leads, to, increased, and, vibrant, participation, in, the, everyday, world, nanak, described, living, an, active, creative, and, practical, life, of, truthfulness, fidelity, self, control, and, purity, as, being, higher, than, the, metaphysical, truth, through, popular, tradition, nanak, s, teaching, is, understood, to, be, practised, in, three, ways, nanak, is, the, founder, of, sikhism, the, fundamental, beliefs, of, sikhism, articulated, in, the, sacred, scripture, guru, granth, sahib, include, faith, and, meditation, on, the, name, of, the, one, creator, unity, of, all, humankind, engaging, in, selfless, service, striving, for, social, justice, for, the, benefit, and, prosperity, of, all, and, honest, conduct, and, livelihood, while, living, a, householder, s, life, the, guru, granth, sahib, is, worshipped, as, the, supreme, authority, of, sikhism, and, is, considered, the, final, and, perpetual, guru, of, sikhism, as, the, first, guru, of, sikhism, nanak, contributed, a, total, of, 974, hymns, to, the, book, many, sikhs, believe, that, nanak, s, message, was, divinely, revealed, as, his, own, words, in, guru, granth, sahib, state, that, his, teachings, are, as, he, has, received, them, from, the, creator, himself, the, critical, event, of, his, life, in, sultanpur, in, which, he, returned, after, three, days, with, enlightenment, also, supports, this, belief, many, modern, historians, give, weight, to, his, teachings, linkage, with, the, pre, existing, bhakti, sant, and, wali, of, hindu, islamic, tradition, scholars, state, that, in, its, origins, nanak, and, sikhism, were, influenced, by, the, nirguni, formless, god, tradition, of, the, bhakti, movement, in, medieval, india, however, some, historians, do, not, see, evidence, of, sikhism, as, simply, an, extension, of, the, bhakti, movement, sikhism, for, instance, disagreed, with, some, views, of, bhakti, saints, kabir, and, ravidas, the, roots, of, the, sikh, tradition, are, perhaps, in, the, sant, tradition, of, india, whose, ideology, grew, to, become, the, bhakti, tradition, fenech, 2014, suggests, that, indic, mythology, permeates, the, sikh, sacred, canon, the, guru, granth, sahib, and, the, secondary, canon, the, dasam, granth, and, adds, delicate, nuance, and, substance, to, the, sacred, symbolic, universe, of, the, sikhs, of, today, and, of, their, past, ancestors, in, a, letter, dated, 27, october, 1985, to, the, national, spiritual, assembly, of, the, bah, s, of, india, the, universal, house, of, justice, stated, that, nanak, was, endowed, with, a, saintly, character, and, that, he, was, inspired, to, reconcile, the, religions, of, hinduism, and, isl, m, the, followers, of, which, religions, had, been, in, violent, conflict, the, bah, s, thus, view, guru, nanak, as, a, saint, of, the, highest, order, nanak, is, highly, influential, amongst, punjabi, hindus, and, sindhi, hindus, the, majority, of, whom, follow, nanakpanthi, teachings, trilochan, singh, claims, that, for, centuries, tibetans, have, been, making, pilgrimages, to, the, golden, temple, shrine, in, amritsar, to, pay, homage, to, guru, nanak, s, memory, 338, however, tibetans, seem, to, have, confused, nanak, with, the, visit, of, padmasambhava, centuries, earlier, and, have, superimposed, details, of, padmasambhava, onto, nanak, out, of, reverence, believing, the, essence, of, both, figures, is, one, and, the, same, or, mistaken, chronology, according, to, tibetan, scholar, tarthang, tulku, many, tibetans, believe, guru, nanak, was, an, incarnation, of, padmasambhava, both, buddhist, and, bon, tibetans, made, pilgrimages, to, the, golden, temple, in, amritsar, however, they, revered, the, site, for, different, reasons, between, 1930, and, 1935, the, tibetan, spiritual, leader, khyungtr, l, rinpoche, khyung, sprul, rinpoche, travelled, to, india, for, a, second, time, visiting, the, golden, temple, in, amritsar, during, this, visit, 78, whilst, visiting, amritsar, in, 1930, or, 1931, khyung, sprul, and, his, tibetan, entourage, walked, around, the, golden, temple, while, making, offerings, 78, khyung, sprul, referred, to, the, golden, temple, as, guru, nanak, s, palace, tibetan, guru, na, nig, gi, pho, brang, 78, khyung, sprul, returned, to, the, golden, temple, in, amritsar, for, another, time, during, his, third, and, final, visit, to, india, in, 1948, 80, several, years, later, after, the, 1930, 31, visit, of, khyung, sprul, a, tibetan, bonpo, monk, by, the, name, of, kyangts, n, sherab, namgyel, rkyang, btsun, shes, rab, rnam, rgyal, visited, the, golden, temple, at, amritsar, and, offered, the, following,
