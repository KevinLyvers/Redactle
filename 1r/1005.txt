akhenaten, pronounced, k, n, t, n, listen, also, spelled, akhenaton, or, echnaton, ancient, egyptian, n, jtn, n, y, t, y, pronounced, meaning, effective, for, the, aten, was, an, ancient, egyptian, pharaoh, reigning, c, 1353, 1336, or, 1351, 1334, bc, the, tenth, ruler, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, before, the, fifth, year, of, his, reign, he, was, known, as, amenhotep, iv, ancient, egyptian, jmn, tp, meaning, amun, is, satisfied, hellenized, as, amenophis, iv, as, a, pharaoh, akhenaten, is, noted, for, abandoning, traditional, ancient, egyptian, religion, of, polytheism, and, introducing, atenism, or, worship, centered, around, aten, the, views, of, egyptologists, differ, as, to, whether, the, religious, policy, was, absolutely, monotheistic, or, whether, it, was, monolatristic, syncretistic, or, henotheistic, this, culture, shift, away, from, traditional, religion, was, reversed, after, his, death, akhenaten, s, monuments, were, dismantled, and, hidden, his, statues, were, destroyed, and, his, name, excluded, from, lists, of, rulers, compiled, by, later, pharaohs, traditional, religious, practice, was, gradually, restored, notably, under, his, close, successor, tutankhamun, who, changed, his, name, from, tutankhaten, early, in, his, reign, when, some, dozen, years, later, rulers, without, clear, rights, of, succession, from, the, eighteenth, dynasty, founded, a, new, dynasty, they, discredited, akhenaten, and, his, immediate, successors, and, referred, to, akhenaten, as, the, enemy, or, that, criminal, in, archival, records, akhenaten, was, all, but, lost, to, history, until, the, late, 19th, century, discovery, of, amarna, or, akhetaten, the, new, capital, city, he, built, for, the, worship, of, aten, furthermore, in, 1907, a, mummy, that, could, be, akhenaten, s, was, unearthed, from, the, tomb, kv55, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, by, edward, r, ayrton, genetic, testing, has, determined, that, the, man, buried, in, kv55, was, tutankhamun, s, father, but, its, identification, as, akhenaten, has, since, been, questioned, akhenaten, s, rediscovery, and, flinders, petrie, s, early, excavations, at, amarna, sparked, great, public, interest, in, the, pharaoh, and, his, queen, nefertiti, he, has, been, described, as, enigmatic, mysterious, revolutionary, the, greatest, idealist, of, the, world, and, the, first, individual, in, history, but, also, as, a, heretic, fanatic, possibly, insane, and, mad, public, and, scholarly, fascination, with, akhenaten, comes, from, his, connection, with, tutankhamun, the, unique, style, and, high, quality, of, the, pictorial, arts, he, patronized, and, the, religion, he, attempted, to, establish, foreshadowing, monotheism, the, future, akhenaten, was, born, amenhotep, a, younger, son, of, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, and, his, principal, wife, tiye, akhenaten, had, an, elder, brother, crown, prince, thutmose, who, was, recognized, as, amenhotep, iii, s, heir, akhenaten, also, had, four, or, five, sisters, sitamun, henuttaneb, iset, nebetah, and, possibly, beketaten, thutmose, s, early, death, perhaps, around, amenhotep, iii, s, thirtieth, regnal, year, meant, that, akhenaten, was, next, in, line, for, egypt, s, throne, akhenaten, was, married, to, nefertiti, his, great, royal, wife, the, exact, timing, of, their, marriage, is, unknown, but, inscriptions, from, the, pharaoh, s, building, projects, suggest, that, they, married, either, shortly, before, or, after, akhenaten, took, the, throne, for, example, egyptologist, dimitri, laboury, suggests, that, the, marriage, took, place, in, akhenaten, s, fourth, regnal, year, a, secondary, wife, of, akhenaten, named, kiya, is, also, known, from, inscriptions, some, egyptologists, theorize, that, she, gained, her, importance, as, the, mother, of, tutankhamun, william, murnane, proposes, that, kiya, is, the, colloquial, name, of, the, mitanni, princess, tadukhipa, daughter, of, the, mitanni, king, tushratta, who, had, married, amenhotep, iii, before, becoming, the, wife, of, akhenaten, akhenaten, s, other, attested, consorts, are, the, daughter, of, the, eni, asi, ruler, atiya, and, another, daughter, of, the, babylonian, king, burna, buriash, ii, akhenaten, could, have, had, seven, or, eight, children, based, on, inscriptions, egyptologists, are, fairly, certain, about, his, six, daughters, who, are, well, attested, in, contemporary, depictions, among, his, six, daughters, meritaten, was, born, in, regnal, year, one, or, five, meketaten, in, year, four, or, six, ankhesenpaaten, later, queen, of, tutankhamun, before, year, five, or, eight, neferneferuaten, tasherit, in, year, eight, or, nine, neferneferure, in, year, nine, or, ten, and, setepenre, in, year, ten, or, eleven, tutankhamun, born, tutankhaten, was, most, likely, akhenaten, s, son, with, nefertiti, or, another, wife, there, is, less, certainty, around, akhenaten, s, relationship, with, smenkhkare, akhenaten, s, coregent, or, successor, and, husband, to, his, daughter, meritaten, he, could, have, been, akhenaten, s, eldest, son, with, an, unknown, wife, or, akhenaten, s, younger, brother, some, historians, such, as, edward, wente, and, james, allen, have, proposed, that, akhenaten, took, some, of, his, daughters, as, wives, or, sexual, consorts, to, father, a, male, heir, while, this, is, debated, some, historical, parallels, exist, akhenaten, s, father, amenhotep, iii, married, his, daughter, sitamun, while, ramesses, ii, married, two, or, more, of, his, daughters, even, though, their, marriages, might, simply, have, been, ceremonial, in, akhenaten, s, case, his, oldest, daughter, meritaten, is, recorded, as, great, royal, wife, to, smenkhkare, but, is, also, listed, on, a, box, from, tutankhamun, s, tomb, alongside, pharaohs, akhenaten, and, neferneferuaten, as, great, royal, wife, additionally, letters, written, to, akhenaten, from, foreign, rulers, make, reference, to, meritaten, as, mistress, of, the, house, egyptologists, in, the, early, 20th, century, also, believed, that, akhenaten, could, have, fathered, a, child, with, his, second, oldest, daughter, meketaten, meketaten, s, death, at, perhaps, age, ten, to, twelve, is, recorded, in, the, royal, tombs, at, akhetaten, from, around, regnal, years, thirteen, or, fourteen, early, egyptologists, attribute, her, death, to, childbirth, because, of, the, depiction, of, an, infant, in, her, tomb, because, no, husband, is, known, for, meketaten, the, assumption, had, been, that, akhenaten, was, the, father, aidan, dodson, believes, this, to, be, unlikely, as, no, egyptian, tomb, has, been, found, that, mentions, or, alludes, to, the, cause, of, death, of, the, tomb, owner, further, jacobus, van, dijk, proposes, that, the, child, is, a, portrayal, of, meketaten, s, soul, finally, various, monuments, originally, for, kiya, were, reinscribed, for, akhenaten, s, daughters, meritaten, and, ankhesenpaaten, the, revised, inscriptions, list, a, meritaten, tasherit, junior, and, an, ankhesenpaaten, tasherit, according, to, some, this, indicates, that, akhenaten, fathered, his, own, grandchildren, others, hold, that, since, these, grandchildren, are, not, attested, to, elsewhere, they, are, fictions, invented, to, fill, the, space, originally, portraying, kiya, s, child, egyptologists, know, very, little, about, akhenaten, s, life, as, prince, amenhotep, donald, b, redford, dates, his, birth, before, his, father, amenhotep, iii, s, 25th, regnal, year, c, 1363, 1361, bc, based, on, the, birth, of, akhenaten, s, first, daughter, who, was, likely, born, fairly, early, in, his, own, reign, the, only, mention, of, his, name, as, the, king, s, son, amenhotep, was, found, on, a, wine, docket, at, amenhotep, iii, s, malkata, palace, where, some, historians, suggested, akhenaten, was, born, others, contend, that, he, was, born, at, memphis, where, growing, up, he, was, influenced, by, the, worship, of, the, sun, god, ra, practiced, at, nearby, heliopolis, redford, and, james, k, hoffmeier, state, however, that, ra, s, cult, was, so, widespread, and, established, throughout, egypt, that, akhenaten, could, have, been, influenced, by, solar, worship, even, if, he, did, not, grow, up, around, heliopolis, some, historians, have, tried, to, determine, who, was, akhenaten, s, tutor, during, his, youth, and, have, proposed, scribes, heqareshu, or, meryre, ii, the, royal, tutor, amenemotep, or, the, vizier, aperel, the, only, person, who, we, know, for, certain, served, the, prince, was, parennefer, whose, tomb, mentions, this, fact, egyptologist, cyril, aldred, suggests, that, prince, amenhotep, might, have, been, a, high, priest, of, ptah, in, memphis, although, no, evidence, supporting, this, had, been, found, it, is, known, that, amenhotep, s, brother, crown, prince, thutmose, served, in, this, role, before, he, died, if, amenhotep, inherited, all, his, brother, s, roles, in, preparation, for, his, accession, to, the, throne, he, might, have, become, a, high, priest, in, thutmose, s, stead, aldred, proposes, that, akhenaten, s, unusual, artistic, inclinations, might, have, been, formed, during, his, time, serving, ptah, the, patron, god, of, craftsmen, whose, high, priests, were, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, greatest, of, the, directors, of, craftsmanship, there, is, much, controversy, around, whether, amenhotep, iv, ascended, to, egypt, s, throne, on, the, death, of, his, father, amenhotep, iii, or, whether, there, was, a, coregency, lasting, perhaps, as, long, as, 12, years, eric, cline, nicholas, reeves, peter, dorman, and, other, scholars, argue, strongly, against, the, establishment, of, a, long, coregency, between, the, two, rulers, and, in, favor, of, either, no, coregency, or, one, lasting, at, most, two, years, donald, b, redford, william, j, murnane, alan, gardiner, and, lawrence, berman, contest, the, view, of, any, coregency, whatsoever, between, akhenaten, and, his, father, most, recently, in, 2014, archaeologists, found, both, pharaohs, names, inscribed, on, the, wall, of, the, luxor, tomb, of, vizier, amenhotep, huy, the, egyptian, ministry, of, antiquities, called, this, conclusive, evidence, that, akhenaten, shared, power, with, his, father, for, at, least, eight, years, based, on, the, dating, of, the, tomb, however, this, conclusion, has, since, been, called, into, question, by, other, egyptologists, according, to, whom, the, inscription, only, means, that, construction, on, amenhotep, huy, s, tomb, started, during, amenhotep, iii, s, reign, and, ended, under, akhenaten, s, and, amenhotep, huy, thus, simply, wanted, to, pay, his, respects, to, both, rulers, akhenaten, took, egypt, s, throne, as, amenhotep, iv, most, likely, in, 1353, or, 1351, bc, it, is, unknown, how, old, amenhotep, iv, was, when, he, did, this, estimates, range, from, 10, to, 23, he, was, most, likely, crowned, in, thebes, or, less, likely, at, memphis, or, armant, the, beginning, of, amenhotep, iv, s, reign, followed, established, pharaonic, traditions, he, did, not, immediately, start, redirecting, worship, toward, the, aten, and, distancing, himself, from, other, gods, egyptologist, donald, b, redford, believes, this, implied, that, amenhotep, iv, s, eventual, religious, policies, were, not, conceived, of, before, his, reign, and, he, did, not, follow, a, pre, established, plan, or, program, redford, points, to, three, pieces, of, evidence, to, support, this, first, surviving, inscriptions, show, amenhotep, iv, worshipping, several, different, gods, including, atum, osiris, anubis, nekhbet, hathor, and, the, eye, of, ra, and, texts, from, this, era, refer, to, the, gods, and, every, god, and, every, goddess, the, high, priest, of, amun, was, also, still, active, in, the, fourth, year, of, amenhotep, iv, s, reign, second, even, though, he, later, moved, his, capital, from, thebes, to, akhetaten, his, initial, royal, titulary, honored, thebes, his, nomen, was, amenhotep, god, ruler, of, thebes, and, recognizing, its, importance, he, called, the, city, southern, heliopolis, the, first, great, seat, of, re, or, the, disc, third, amenhotep, iv, did, not, yet, destroy, temples, to, the, other, gods, and, he, even, continued, his, father, s, construction, projects, at, karnak, s, precinct, of, amun, re, he, decorated, the, walls, of, the, precinct, s, third, pylon, with, images, of, himself, worshipping, ra, horakhty, portrayed, in, the, god, s, traditional, form, of, a, falcon, headed, man, artistic, depictions, continued, unchanged, early, in, amenhotep, iv, s, reign, tombs, built, or, completed, in, the, first, few, years, after, he, took, the, throne, such, as, those, of, kheruef, ramose, and, parennefer, show, the, pharaoh, in, the, traditional, artistic, style, in, ramose, s, tomb, amenhotep, iv, appears, on, the, west, wall, seated, on, a, throne, with, ramose, appearing, before, the, pharaoh, on, the, other, side, of, the, doorway, amenhotep, iv, and, nefertiti, are, shown, in, the, window, of, appearances, with, the, aten, depicted, as, the, sun, disc, in, parennefer, s, tomb, amenhotep, iv, and, nefertiti, are, seated, on, a, throne, with, the, sun, disc, depicted, over, the, pharaoh, and, his, queen, while, continuing, the, worship, of, other, gods, amenhotep, iv, s, initial, building, program, sought, to, build, new, places, of, worship, to, the, aten, he, ordered, the, construction, of, temples, or, shrines, to, the, aten, in, several, cities, across, the, country, such, as, bubastis, tell, el, borg, heliopolis, memphis, nekhen, kawa, and, kerma, he, also, ordered, the, construction, of, a, large, temple, complex, dedicated, to, the, aten, at, karnak, in, thebes, northeast, of, the, parts, of, the, karnak, complex, dedicated, to, amun, the, aten, temple, complex, collectively, known, as, the, per, aten, house, of, the, aten, consisted, of, several, temples, whose, names, survive, the, gempaaten, the, aten, is, found, in, the, estate, of, the, aten, the, hwt, benben, house, or, temple, of, the, benben, the, rud, menu, enduring, of, monuments, for, aten, forever, the, teni, menu, exalted, are, the, monuments, of, the, aten, forever, and, the, sekhen, aten, booth, of, aten, around, regnal, year, two, or, three, amenhotep, iv, organized, a, sed, festival, sed, festivals, were, ritual, rejuvenations, of, an, aging, pharaoh, which, usually, took, place, for, the, first, time, around, the, thirtieth, year, of, a, pharaoh, s, reign, and, every, three, or, so, years, thereafter, egyptologists, only, speculate, as, to, why, amenhotep, iv, organized, a, sed, festival, when, he, was, likely, still, in, his, early, twenties, some, historians, see, it, as, evidence, for, amenhotep, iii, and, amenhotep, iv, s, coregency, and, believed, that, amenhotep, iv, s, sed, festival, coincided, with, one, of, his, father, s, celebrations, others, speculate, that, amenhotep, iv, chose, to, hold, his, festival, three, years, after, his, father, s, death, aiming, to, proclaim, his, rule, a, continuation, of, his, father, s, reign, yet, others, believe, that, the, festival, was, held, to, honor, the, aten, on, whose, behalf, the, pharaoh, ruled, egypt, or, as, amenhotep, iii, was, considered, to, have, become, one, with, the, aten, following, his, death, the, sed, festival, honored, both, the, pharaoh, and, the, god, at, the, same, time, it, is, also, possible, that, the, purpose, of, the, ceremony, was, to, figuratively, fill, amenhotep, iv, with, strength, before, his, great, enterprise, the, introduction, of, the, aten, cult, and, the, founding, of, the, new, capital, akhetaten, regardless, of, the, celebration, s, aim, egyptologists, believe, that, during, the, festivities, amenhotep, iv, only, made, offerings, to, the, aten, rather, than, the, many, gods, and, goddesses, as, was, customary, among, the, last, documents, that, refer, to, akhenaten, as, amenhotep, iv, are, two, copies, of, a, letter, to, the, pharaoh, from, ipy, the, high, steward, of, memphis, these, letters, found, at, gurob, informing, the, pharaoh, that, the, royal, estates, in, memphis, are, in, good, order, and, the, temple, of, ptah, is, prosperous, and, flourishing, are, dated, to, regnal, year, five, day, nineteen, of, the, growing, season, s, third, month, about, a, month, later, day, thirteen, of, the, growing, season, s, fourth, month, one, of, the, boundary, stela, at, akhetaten, already, had, the, name, akhenaten, carved, on, it, implying, that, the, pharaoh, changed, his, name, between, the, two, inscriptions, amenhotep, iv, changed, his, royal, titulary, to, show, his, devotion, to, the, aten, no, longer, would, he, be, known, as, amenhotep, iv, and, be, associated, with, the, god, amun, but, rather, he, would, completely, shift, his, focus, to, the, aten, egyptologists, debate, the, exact, meaning, of, akhenaten, his, new, personal, name, the, word, akh, ancient, egyptian, could, have, different, translations, such, as, satisfied, effective, spirit, or, serviceable, to, and, thus, akhenaten, s, name, could, be, translated, to, mean, aten, is, satisfied, effective, spirit, of, the, aten, or, serviceable, to, the, aten, respectively, gertie, englund, and, florence, friedman, arrive, at, the, translation, effective, for, the, aten, by, analyzing, contemporary, texts, and, inscriptions, in, which, akhenaten, often, described, himself, as, being, effective, for, the, sun, disc, englund, and, friedman, conclude, that, the, frequency, with, which, akhenaten, used, this, term, likely, means, that, his, own, name, meant, effective, for, the, aten, some, historians, such, as, william, f, albright, edel, elmar, and, gerhard, fecht, propose, that, akhenaten, s, name, is, misspelled, and, mispronounced, these, historians, believe, aten, should, rather, be, j, ti, thus, rendering, the, pharaoh, s, name, akhenj, ti, or, a, anj, ti, pronounced, k, n, j, t, as, it, could, have, been, pronounced, in, ancient, egypt, kanakht, qai, shuti, strong, bull, of, the, double, plumes, beloved, of, aten, great, of, kingship, in, karnak, great, of, kingship, in, akhet, aten, crowned, in, heliopolis, of, the, south, thebes, exalter, of, the, name, of, aten, amun, is, satisfied, divine, lord, of, thebes, effective, for, the, aten, around, the, same, time, he, changed, his, royal, titulary, on, the, thirteenth, day, of, the, growing, season, s, fourth, month, akhenaten, decreed, that, a, new, capital, city, be, built, akhetaten, ancient, egyptian, t, jtn, meaning, horizon, of, the, aten, better, known, today, as, amarna, the, events, egyptologists, know, the, most, about, during, akhenaten, s, life, are, connected, with, founding, akhetaten, as, several, so, called, boundary, stelae, were, found, around, the, city, to, mark, its, boundary, the, pharaoh, chose, a, site, about, halfway, between, thebes, the, capital, at, the, time, and, memphis, on, the, east, bank, of, the, nile, where, a, wadi, and, a, natural, dip, in, the, surrounding, cliffs, form, a, silhouette, similar, to, the, horizon, hieroglyph, additionally, the, site, had, previously, been, uninhabited, according, to, inscriptions, on, one, boundary, stela, the, site, was, appropriate, for, aten, s, city, for, not, being, the, property, of, a, god, nor, being, the, property, of, a, goddess, nor, being, the, property, of, a, ruler, nor, being, the, property, of, a, female, ruler, nor, being, the, property, of, any, people, able, to, lay, claim, to, it, historians, do, not, know, for, certain, why, akhenaten, established, a, new, capital, and, left, thebes, the, old, capital, the, boundary, stelae, detailing, akhetaten, s, founding, is, damaged, where, it, likely, explained, the, pharaoh, s, motives, for, the, move, surviving, parts, claim, what, happened, to, akhenaten, was, worse, than, those, that, i, heard, previously, in, his, reign, and, worse, than, those, heard, by, any, kings, who, assumed, the, white, crown, and, alludes, to, offensive, speech, against, the, aten, egyptologists, believe, that, akhenaten, could, be, referring, to, conflict, with, the, priesthood, and, followers, of, amun, the, patron, god, of, thebes, the, great, temples, of, amun, such, as, karnak, were, all, located, in, thebes, and, the, priests, there, achieved, significant, power, earlier, in, the, eighteenth, dynasty, especially, under, hatshepsut, and, thutmose, iii, thanks, to, pharaohs, offering, large, amounts, of, egypt, s, growing, wealth, to, the, cult, of, amun, historians, such, as, donald, b, redford, therefore, posited, that, by, moving, to, a, new, capital, akhenaten, may, have, been, trying, to, break, with, amun, s, priests, and, the, god, akhetaten, was, a, planned, city, with, the, great, temple, of, the, aten, small, aten, temple, royal, residences, records, office, and, government, buildings, in, the, city, center, some, of, these, buildings, such, as, the, aten, temples, were, ordered, to, be, built, by, akhenaten, on, the, boundary, stela, decreeing, the, city, s, founding, the, city, was, built, quickly, thanks, to, a, new, construction, method, that, used, substantially, smaller, building, blocks, than, under, previous, pharaohs, these, blocks, called, talatats, measured, 1, 2, by, 1, 2, by, 1, ancient, egyptian, cubits, c, 27, by, 27, by, 54, cm, and, because, of, the, smaller, weight, and, standardized, size, using, them, during, constructions, was, more, efficient, than, using, heavy, building, blocks, of, varying, sizes, by, regnal, year, eight, akhetaten, reached, a, state, where, it, could, be, occupied, by, the, royal, family, only, his, most, loyal, subjects, followed, akhenaten, and, his, family, to, the, new, city, while, the, city, continued, to, be, built, in, years, five, through, eight, construction, work, began, to, stop, in, thebes, the, theban, aten, temples, that, had, begun, were, abandoned, and, a, village, of, those, working, on, valley, of, the, kings, tombs, was, relocated, to, the, workers, village, at, akhetaten, however, construction, work, continued, in, the, rest, of, the, country, as, larger, cult, centers, such, as, heliopolis, and, memphis, also, had, temples, built, for, aten, the, amarna, letters, have, provided, important, evidence, about, akhenaten, s, reign, and, foreign, policy, the, letters, are, a, cache, of, 382, diplomatic, texts, and, literary, and, educational, materials, discovered, between, 1887, and, 1979, and, named, after, amarna, the, modern, name, for, akhenaten, s, capital, akhetaten, the, diplomatic, correspondence, comprises, clay, tablet, messages, between, amenhotep, iii, akhenaten, and, tutankhamun, various, subjects, through, egyptian, military, outposts, rulers, of, vassal, states, and, the, foreign, rulers, of, babylonia, assyria, syria, canaan, alashiya, arzawa, mitanni, and, the, hittites, the, amarna, letters, portray, the, international, situation, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, that, akhenaten, inherited, from, his, predecessors, in, the, 200, years, preceding, akhenaten, s, reign, following, the, expulsion, of, the, hyksos, from, lower, egypt, at, the, end, of, the, second, intermediate, period, the, kingdom, s, influence, and, military, might, increased, greatly, egypt, s, power, reached, new, heights, under, thutmose, iii, who, ruled, approximately, 100, years, before, akhenaten, and, led, several, successful, military, campaigns, into, nubia, and, syria, egypt, s, expansion, led, to, confrontation, with, the, mitanni, but, this, rivalry, ended, with, the, two, nations, becoming, allies, slowly, however, egypt, s, power, started, to, wane, amenhotep, iii, aimed, to, maintain, the, balance, of, power, through, marriages, such, as, his, marriage, to, tadukhipa, daughter, of, the, mitanni, king, tushratta, and, vassal, states, under, amenhotep, iii, and, akhenaten, egypt, was, unable, or, unwilling, to, oppose, the, rise, of, the, hittites, around, syria, the, pharaohs, seemed, to, eschew, military, confrontation, at, a, time, when, the, balance, of, power, between, egypt, s, neighbors, and, rivals, was, shifting, and, the, hittites, a, confrontational, state, overtook, the, mitanni, in, influence, early, in, his, reign, akhenaten, was, evidently, concerned, about, the, expanding, power, of, the, hittite, empire, under, uppiluliuma, i, a, successful, hittite, attack, on, mitanni, and, its, ruler, tushratta, would, have, disrupted, the, entire, international, balance, of, power, in, the, ancient, middle, east, at, a, time, when, egypt, had, made, peace, with, mitanni, this, would, cause, some, of, egypt, s, vassals, to, switch, their, allegiances, to, the, hittites, as, time, would, prove, a, group, of, egypt, s, allies, who, attempted, to, rebel, against, the, hittites, were, captured, and, wrote, letters, begging, akhenaten, for, troops, but, he, did, not, respond, to, most, of, their, pleas, evidence, suggests, that, the, troubles, on, the, northern, frontier, led, to, difficulties, in, canaan, particularly, in, a, struggle, for, power, between, labaya, of, shechem, and, abdi, heba, of, jerusalem, which, required, the, pharaoh, to, intervene, in, the, area, by, dispatching, medjay, troops, northwards, akhenaten, pointedly, refused, to, save, his, vassal, rib, hadda, of, byblos, whose, kingdom, was, being, besieged, by, the, expanding, state, of, amurru, under, abdi, ashirta, and, later, aziru, son, of, abdi, ashirta, despite, rib, hadda, s, numerous, pleas, for, help, from, the, pharaoh, rib, hadda, wrote, a, total, of, 60, letters, to, akhenaten, pleading, for, aid, from, the, pharaoh, akhenaten, wearied, of, rib, hadda, s, constant, correspondences, and, once, told, rib, hadda, you, are, the, one, that, writes, to, me, more, than, all, the, other, mayors, or, egyptian, vassals, in, ea, 124, what, rib, hadda, did, not, comprehend, was, that, the, egyptian, king, would, not, organize, and, dispatch, an, entire, army, north, just, to, preserve, the, political, status, quo, of, several, minor, city, states, on, the, fringes, of, egypt, s, asiatic, empire, rib, hadda, would, pay, the, ultimate, price, his, exile, from, byblos, due, to, a, coup, led, by, his, brother, ilirabih, is, mentioned, in, one, letter, when, rib, hadda, appealed, in, vain, for, aid, from, akhenaten, and, then, turned, to, aziru, his, sworn, enemy, to, place, him, back, on, the, throne, of, his, city, aziru, promptly, had, him, dispatched, to, the, king, of, sidon, where, rib, hadda, was, almost, certainly, executed, in, a, view, discounted, by, the, 21st, century, several, egyptologists, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, interpreted, the, amarna, letters, to, mean, that, akhenaten, was, a, pacifist, who, neglected, foreign, policy, and, egypt, s, foreign, territories, in, favor, of, his, internal, reforms, for, example, henry, hall, believed, akhenaten, succeeded, by, his, obstinate, doctrinaire, love, of, peace, in, causing, far, more, misery, in, his, world, than, half, a, dozen, elderly, militarists, could, have, done, while, james, henry, breasted, said, akhenaten, was, not, fit, to, cope, with, a, situation, demanding, an, aggressive, man, of, affairs, and, a, skilled, military, leader, others, noted, that, the, amarna, letters, counter, the, conventional, view, that, akhenaten, neglected, egypt, s, foreign, territories, in, favour, of, his, internal, reforms, for, instance, norman, de, garis, davies, praised, akhenaten, s, emphasis, on, diplomacy, over, war, while, james, baikie, said, that, the, fact, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, revolt, within, the, borders, of, egypt, itself, during, the, whole, reign, is, surely, ample, proof, that, there, was, no, such, abandonment, of, his, royal, duties, on, the, part, of, akhenaten, as, has, been, assumed, indeed, several, letters, from, egyptian, vassals, notified, the, pharaoh, that, they, have, followed, his, instructions, implying, that, the, pharaoh, sent, such, instructions, the, amarna, letters, also, show, that, vassal, states, were, told, repeatedly, to, expect, the, arrival, of, the, egyptian, military, on, their, lands, and, provide, evidence, that, these, troops, were, dispatched, and, arrived, at, their, destination, dozens, of, letters, detail, that, akhenaten, and, amenhotep, iii, sent, egyptian, and, nubian, troops, armies, archers, chariots, horses, and, ships, only, one, military, campaign, is, known, for, certain, under, akhenaten, s, reign, in, his, second, or, twelfth, year, akhenaten, ordered, his, viceroy, of, kush, tuthmose, to, lead, a, military, expedition, to, quell, a, rebellion, and, raids, on, settlements, on, the, nile, by, nubian, nomadic, tribes, the, victory, was, commemorated, on, two, stelae, one, discovered, at, amada, and, another, at, buhen, egyptologists, differ, on, the, size, of, the, campaign, wolfgang, helck, considered, it, a, small, scale, police, operation, while, alan, schulman, considered, it, a, war, of, major, proportions, other, egyptologists, suggested, that, akhenaten, could, have, waged, war, in, syria, or, the, levant, possibly, against, the, hittites, cyril, aldred, based, on, amarna, letters, describing, egyptian, troop, movements, proposed, that, akhenaten, launched, an, unsuccessful, war, around, the, city, of, gezer, while, marc, gabolde, argued, for, an, unsuccessful, campaign, around, kadesh, either, of, these, could, be, the, campaign, referred, to, on, tutankhamun, s, restoration, stela, if, an, army, was, sent, to, djahy, to, broaden, the, boundaries, of, egypt, no, success, of, their, cause, came, to, pass, john, coleman, darnell, and, colleen, manassa, also, argued, that, akhenaten, fought, with, the, hittites, for, control, of, kadesh, but, was, unsuccessful, the, city, was, not, recaptured, until, 60, 70, years, later, under, seti, i, overall, archeological, evidence, suggests, that, akhenaten, paid, close, attention, to, the, affairs, of, egyptian, vassals, in, canaan, and, syria, though, primarily, not, through, letters, such, as, those, found, at, amarna, but, through, reports, from, government, officials, and, agents, akhenaten, managed, to, preserve, egypt, s, control, over, the, core, of, its, near, eastern, empire, which, consisted, of, present, day, israel, as, well, as, the, phoenician, coast, while, avoiding, conflict, with, the, increasingly, powerful, and, aggressive, hittite, empire, of, uppiluliuma, i, which, overtook, the, mitanni, as, the, dominant, power, in, the, northern, part, of, the, region, only, the, egyptian, border, province, of, amurru, in, syria, around, the, orontes, river, was, lost, to, the, hittites, when, its, ruler, aziru, defected, to, the, hittites, ordered, by, akhenaten, to, come, to, egypt, aziru, was, released, after, promising, to, stay, loyal, to, the, pharaoh, nonetheless, turning, to, the, hittites, soon, after, his, release, egyptologists, know, little, about, the, last, five, years, of, akhenaten, s, reign, beginning, in, c, 1341, or, 1339, bc, these, years, are, poorly, attested, and, only, a, few, pieces, of, contemporary, evidence, survive, the, lack, of, clarity, makes, reconstructing, the, latter, part, of, the, pharaoh, s, reign, a, daunting, task, and, a, controversial, and, contested, topic, of, discussion, among, egyptologists, among, the, newest, pieces, of, evidence, is, an, inscription, discovered, in, 2012, at, a, limestone, quarry, in, deir, el, bersha, just, north, of, akhetaten, from, the, pharaoh, s, sixteenth, regnal, year, the, text, refers, to, a, building, project, in, amarna, and, establishes, that, akhenaten, and, nefertiti, were, still, a, royal, couple, just, a, year, before, akhenaten, s, death, the, inscription, is, dated, to, year, 16, month, 3, of, akhet, day, 15, of, the, reign, of, akhenaten, before, the, 2012, discovery, of, the, deir, el, bersha, inscription, the, last, known, fixed, date, event, in, akhenaten, s, reign, was, a, royal, reception, in, regnal, year, twelve, in, which, the, pharaoh, and, the, royal, family, received, tributes, and, offerings, from, allied, countries, and, vassal, states, at, akhetaten, inscriptions, show, tributes, from, nubia, the, land, of, punt, syria, the, kingdom, of, hattusa, the, islands, in, the, mediterranean, sea, and, libya, egyptologists, such, as, aidan, dodson, consider, this, year, twelve, celebration, to, be, the, zenith, of, akhenaten, s, reign, thanks, to, reliefs, in, the, tomb, of, courtier, meryre, ii, historians, know, that, the, royal, family, akhenaten, nefertiti, and, their, six, daughters, were, present, at, the, royal, reception, in, full, however, historians, are, uncertain, about, the, reasons, for, the, reception, possibilities, include, the, celebration, of, the, marriage, of, future, pharaoh, ay, to, tey, celebration, of, akhenaten, s, twelve, years, on, the, throne, the, summons, of, king, aziru, of, amurru, to, egypt, a, military, victory, at, sumur, in, the, levant, a, successful, military, campaign, in, nubia, nefertiti, s, ascendancy, to, the, throne, as, coregent, or, the, completion, of, the, new, capital, city, akhetaten, following, year, twelve, donald, b, redford, and, other, egyptologists, proposed, that, egypt, was, struck, by, an, epidemic, most, likely, a, plague, contemporary, evidence, suggests, that, a, plague, ravaged, through, the, middle, east, around, this, time, and, ambassadors, and, delegations, arriving, to, akhenaten, s, year, twelve, reception, might, have, brought, the, disease, to, egypt, alternatively, letters, from, the, hattians, might, suggest, that, the, epidemic, originated, in, egypt, and, was, carried, throughout, the, middle, east, by, egyptian, prisoners, of, war, regardless, of, its, origin, the, epidemic, might, account, for, several, deaths, in, the, royal, family, that, occurred, in, the, last, five, years, of, akhenaten, s, reign, including, those, of, his, daughters, meketaten, neferneferure, and, setepenre, akhenaten, could, have, ruled, together, with, smenkhkare, and, nefertiti, for, several, years, before, his, death, based, on, depictions, and, artifacts, from, the, tombs, of, meryre, ii, and, tutankhamun, smenkhkare, could, have, been, akhenaten, s, coregent, by, regnal, year, thirteen, or, fourteen, but, died, a, year, or, two, later, nefertiti, might, not, have, assumed, the, role, of, coregent, until, after, year, sixteen, when, a, stela, still, mentions, her, as, akhenaten, s, great, royal, wife, while, nefertiti, s, familial, relationship, with, akhenaten, is, known, whether, akhenaten, and, smenkhkare, were, related, by, blood, is, unclear, smenkhkare, could, have, been, akhenaten, s, son, or, brother, as, the, son, of, amenhotep, iii, with, tiye, or, sitamun, archaeological, evidence, makes, it, clear, however, that, smenkhkare, was, married, to, meritaten, akhenaten, s, eldest, daughter, for, another, the, so, called, coregency, stela, found, in, a, tomb, at, akhetaten, might, show, queen, nefertiti, as, akhenaten, s, coregent, but, this, is, uncertain, as, the, stela, was, recarved, to, show, the, names, of, ankhesenpaaten, and, neferneferuaten, egyptologist, aidan, dodson, proposed, that, both, smenkhkare, and, neferiti, were, akhenaten, s, coregents, to, ensure, the, amarna, family, s, continued, rule, when, egypt, was, confronted, with, an, epidemic, dodson, suggested, that, the, two, were, chosen, to, rule, as, tutankhaten, s, coregent, in, case, akhenaten, died, and, tutankhaten, took, the, throne, at, a, young, age, or, rule, in, tutankhaten, s, stead, if, the, prince, also, died, in, the, epidemic, akhenaten, died, after, seventeen, years, of, rule, and, was, initially, buried, in, a, tomb, in, the, royal, wadi, east, of, akhetaten, the, order, to, construct, the, tomb, and, to, bury, the, pharaoh, there, was, commemorated, on, one, of, the, boundary, stela, delineating, the, capital, s, borders, let, a, tomb, be, made, for, me, in, the, eastern, mountain, let, my, burial, be, made, in, it, in, the, millions, of, jubilees, which, the, aten, my, father, decreed, for, me, in, the, years, following, the, burial, akhenaten, s, sarcophagus, was, destroyed, and, left, in, the, akhetaten, necropolis, reconstructed, in, the, 20th, century, it, is, in, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, as, of, 2019, despite, leaving, the, sarcophagus, behind, akhenaten, s, mummy, was, removed, from, the, royal, tombs, after, tutankhamun, abandoned, akhetaten, and, returned, to, thebes, it, was, most, likely, moved, to, tomb, kv55, in, valley, of, the, kings, near, thebes, this, tomb, was, later, desecrated, likely, during, the, ramesside, period, whether, smenkhkare, also, enjoyed, a, brief, independent, reign, after, akhenaten, is, unclear, if, smenkhkare, outlived, akhenaten, and, became, sole, pharaoh, he, likely, ruled, egypt, for, less, than, a, year, the, next, successor, was, nefertiti, or, meritaten, ruling, as, neferneferuaten, reigning, in, egypt, for, about, two, years, she, was, in, turn, probably, succeeded, by, tutankhaten, with, the, country, being, administered, by, the, vizier, and, future, pharaoh, ay, while, akhenaten, along, with, smenkhkare, was, most, likely, reburied, in, tomb, kv55, the, identification, of, the, mummy, found, in, that, tomb, as, akhenaten, remains, controversial, to, this, day, the, mummy, has, repeatedly, been, examined, since, its, discovery, in, 1907, most, recently, egyptologist, zahi, hawass, led, a, team, of, researchers, to, examine, the, mummy, using, medical, and, dna, analysis, with, the, results, published, in, 2010, in, releasing, their, test, results, hawass, s, team, identified, the, mummy, as, the, father, of, tutankhamun, and, thus, most, probably, akhenaten, however, the, study, s, validity, has, since, been, called, into, question, for, instance, the, discussion, of, the, study, results, does, not, discuss, that, tutankhamun, s, father, and, the, father, s, siblings, would, share, some, genetic, markers, if, tutankhamun, s, father, was, akhenaten, the, dna, results, could, indicate, that, the, mummy, is, a, brother, of, akhenaten, possibly, smenkhkare, with, akhenaten, s, death, the, aten, cult, he, had, founded, fell, out, of, favor, at, first, gradually, and, then, with, decisive, finality, tutankhaten, changed, his, name, to, tutankhamun, in, year, 2, of, his, reign, c, 1332, bc, and, abandoned, the, city, of, akhetaten, their, successors, then, attempted, to, erase, akhenaten, and, his, family, from, the, historical, record, during, the, reign, of, horemheb, the, last, pharaoh, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, and, the, first, pharaoh, after, akhenaten, who, was, not, related, to, akhenaten, s, family, egyptians, started, to, destroy, temples, to, the, aten, and, reuse, the, building, blocks, in, new, construction, projects, including, in, temples, for, the, newly, restored, god, amun, horemheb, s, successor, continued, in, this, effort, seti, i, restored, monuments, to, amun, and, had, the, god, s, name, re, carved, on, inscriptions, where, it, was, removed, by, akhenaten, seti, i, also, ordered, that, akhenaten, smenkhkare, neferneferuaten, tutankhamun, and, ay, be, excised, from, official, lists, of, pharaohs, to, make, it, appear, that, amenhotep, iii, was, immediately, succeeded, by, horemheb, under, the, ramessides, who, succeeded, seti, i, akhetaten, was, gradually, destroyed, and, the, building, material, reused, across, the, country, such, as, in, constructions, at, hermopolis, the, negative, attitudes, toward, akhenaten, were, illustrated, by, for, example, inscriptions, in, the, tomb, of, scribe, mose, or, mes, where, akhenaten, s, reign, is, referred, to, as, the, time, of, the, enemy, of, akhet, aten, some, egyptologists, such, as, jacobus, van, dijk, and, jan, assmann, believe, that, akhenaten, s, reign, and, the, amarna, period, started, a, gradual, decline, in, the, egyptian, government, s, power, and, the, pharaoh, s, standing, in, egyptian, s, society, and, religious, life, akhenaten, s, religious, reforms, subverted, the, relationship, ordinary, egyptians, had, with, their, gods, and, their, pharaoh, as, well, as, the, role, the, pharaoh, played, in, the, relationship, between, the, people, and, the, gods, before, the, amarna, period, the, pharaoh, was, the, representative, of, the, gods, on, earth, the, son, of, the, god, ra, and, the, living, incarnation, of, the, god, horus, and, maintained, the, divine, order, through, rituals, and, offerings, and, by, sustaining, the, temples, of, the, gods, additionally, even, though, the, pharaoh, oversaw, all, religious, activity, egyptians, could, access, their, gods, through, regular, public, holidays, festivals, and, processions, this, led, to, a, seemingly, close, connection, between, people, and, the, gods, especially, the, patron, deity, of, their, respective, towns, and, cities, akhenaten, however, banned, the, worship, of, gods, beside, the, aten, including, through, festivals, he, also, declared, himself, to, be, the, only, one, who, could, worship, the, aten, and, required, that, all, religious, devotion, previously, exhibited, toward, the, gods, be, directed, toward, himself, after, the, amarna, period, during, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, dynasties, c, 270, years, following, akhenaten, s, death, the, relationship, between, the, people, the, pharaoh, and, the, gods, did, not, simply, revert, to, pre, amarna, practices, and, beliefs, the, worship, of, all, gods, returned, but, the, relationship, between, the, gods, and, the, worshipers, became, more, direct, and, personal, circumventing, the, pharaoh, rather, than, acting, through, the, pharaoh, egyptians, started, to, believe, that, the, gods, intervened, directly, in, their, lives, protecting, the, pious, and, punishing, criminals, the, gods, replaced, the, pharaoh, as, their, own, representatives, on, earth, the, god, amun, once, again, became, king, among, all, gods, according, to, van, dijk, the, king, was, no, longer, a, god, but, god, himself, had, become, king, once, amun, had, been, recognized, as, the, true, king, the, political, power, of, the, earthly, rulers, could, be, reduced, to, a, minimum, consequently, the, influence, and, power, of, the, amun, priesthood, continued, to, grow, until, the, twenty, first, dynasty, c, 1077, bc, by, which, time, the, high, priests, of, amun, effectively, became, rulers, over, parts, of, egypt, akhenaten, s, reforms, also, had, a, longer, term, impact, on, ancient, egyptian, language, and, hastened, the, spread, of, the, spoken, late, egyptian, language, in, official, writings, and, speeches, spoken, and, written, egyptian, diverged, early, on, in, egyptian, history, and, stayed, different, over, time, during, the, amarna, period, however, royal, and, religious, texts, and, inscriptions, including, the, boundary, stelae, at, akhetaten, or, the, amarna, letters, started, to, regularly, include, more, vernacular, linguistic, elements, such, as, the, definite, article, or, a, new, possessive, form, even, though, they, continued, to, diverge, these, changes, brought, the, spoken, and, written, language, closer, to, one, another, more, systematically, than, under, previous, pharaohs, of, the, new, kingdom, while, akhenaten, s, successors, attempted, to, erase, his, religious, artistic, and, even, linguistic, changes, from, history, the, new, linguistic, elements, remained, a, more, common, part, of, official, texts, following, the, amarna, years, starting, with, the, nineteenth, dynasty, akhenaten, is, also, recognized, as, a, prophet, in, the, druze, faith, egyptians, worshipped, a, sun, god, under, several, names, and, solar, worship, had, been, growing, in, popularity, even, before, akhenaten, especially, during, the, eighteenth, dynasty, and, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, akhenaten, s, father, during, the, new, kingdom, the, pharaoh, started, to, be, associated, with, the, sun, disc, for, example, one, inscription, called, the, pharaoh, hatshepsut, the, female, re, shining, like, the, disc, while, amenhotep, iii, was, described, as, he, who, rises, over, every, foreign, land, nebmare, the, dazzling, disc, during, the, eighteenth, dynasty, a, religious, hymn, to, the, sun, also, appeared, and, became, popular, among, egyptians, however, egyptologists, question, whether, there, is, a, causal, relationship, between, the, cult, of, the, sun, disc, before, akhenaten, and, akhenaten, s, religious, policies, the, implementation, of, atenism, can, be, traced, through, gradual, changes, in, the, aten, s, iconography, and, egyptologist, donald, b, redford, divided, its, development, into, three, stages, earliest, intermediate, and, final, in, his, studies, of, akhenaten, and, atenism, the, earliest, stage, was, associated, with, a, growing, number, of, depictions, of, the, sun, disc, though, the, disc, is, still, seen, resting, on, the, head, of, the, falcon, headed, sun, god, ra, horakhty, as, the, god, was, traditionally, represented, the, god, was, only, unique, but, not, exclusive, the, intermediate, stage, was, marked, by, the, elevation, of, the, aten, above, other, gods, and, the, appearance, of, cartouches, around, his, inscribed, name, cartouches, traditionally, indicating, that, the, enclosed, text, is, a, royal, name, the, final, stage, had, the, aten, represented, as, a, sun, disc, with, sunrays, like, long, arms, terminating, in, human, hands, and, the, introduction, of, a, new, epithet, for, the, god, the, great, living, disc, which, is, in, jubilee, lord, of, heaven, and, earth, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, amenhotep, iv, lived, at, thebes, the, old, capital, city, and, permitted, worship, of, egypt, s, traditional, deities, to, continue, however, some, signs, already, pointed, to, the, growing, importance, of, the, aten, for, example, inscriptions, in, the, theban, tomb, of, parennefer, from, the, early, rule, of, amenhotep, iv, state, that, one, measures, the, payments, to, every, other, god, with, a, level, measure, but, for, the, aten, one, measures, so, that, it, overflows, indicating, a, more, favorable, attitude, to, the, cult, of, aten, than, the, other, gods, additionally, near, the, temple, of, karnak, amun, ra, s, great, cult, center, amenhotep, iv, erected, several, massive, buildings, including, temples, to, the, aten, the, new, aten, temples, had, no, roof, and, the, god, was, thus, worshipped, in, the, sunlight, under, the, open, sky, rather, than, in, dark, temple, enclosures, as, had, been, the, previous, custom, the, theban, buildings, were, later, dismantled, by, his, successors, and, used, as, infill, for, new, constructions, in, the, temple, of, karnak, when, they, were, later, dismantled, by, archaeologists, some, 36, 000, decorated, blocks, from, the, original, aten, building, here, were, revealed, that, preserve, many, elements, of, the, original, relief, scenes, and, inscriptions, one, of, the, most, important, turning, points, in, the, early, reign, of, amenhotep, iv, is, a, speech, given, by, the, pharaoh, at, the, beginning, of, his, second, regnal, year, a, copy, of, the, speech, survives, on, one, of, the, pylons, at, the, karnak, temple, complex, near, thebes, speaking, to, the, royal, court, scribes, or, the, people, amenhotep, iv, said, that, the, gods, were, ineffective, and, had, ceased, their, movements, and, that, their, temples, had, collapsed, the, pharaoh, contrasted, this, with, the, only, remaining, god, the, sun, disc, aten, who, continued, to, move, and, exist, forever, some, egyptologists, such, as, donald, b, redford, compared, this, speech, to, a, proclamation, or, manifesto, which, foreshadowed, and, explained, the, pharaoh, s, later, religious, reforms, centered, around, the, aten, in, his, speech, akhenaten, said, the, temples, of, the, gods, fallen, to, ruin, their, bodies, do, not, endure, since, the, time, of, the, ancestors, it, is, the, wise, man, that, knows, these, things, behold, i, the, king, am, speaking, so, that, i, might, inform, you, concerning, the, appearances, of, the, gods, i, know, their, temples, and, i, am, versed, in, the, writings, specifically, the, inventory, of, their, primeval, bodies, and, i, have, watched, as, they, have, ceased, their, appearances, one, after, the, other, all, of, them, have, stopped, except, the, god, who, gave, birth, to, himself, and, no, one, knows, the, mystery, of, how, he, performs, his, tasks, this, god, goes, where, he, pleases, and, no, one, else, knows, his, going, i, approach, him, the, things, which, he, has, made, how, exalted, they, are, in, year, five, of, his, reign, amenhotep, iv, took, decisive, steps, to, establish, the, aten, as, the, sole, god, of, egypt, the, pharaoh, disbanded, the, priesthoods, of, all, the, other, gods, and, diverted, the, income, from, these, cults, to, support, the, aten, to, emphasize, his, complete, allegiance, to, the, aten, the, king, officially, changed, his, name, from, amenhotep, iv, to, akhenaten, ancient, egyptian, n, jtn, meaning, effective, for, the, aten, meanwhile, the, aten, was, becoming, a, king, itself, artists, started, to, depict, him, with, the, trappings, of, pharaohs, placing, his, name, in, cartouches, a, rare, but, not, unique, occurrence, as, the, names, of, ra, horakhty, and, amun, ra, had, also, been, found, enclosed, in, cartouches, and, wearing, a, uraeus, a, symbol, of, kingship, the, aten, may, also, have, been, the, subject, of, akhenaten, s, royal, sed, festival, early, in, the, pharaoh, s, reign, with, aten, becoming, a, sole, deity, akhenaten, started, to, proclaim, himself, as, the, only, intermediary, between, aten, and, his, people, and, the, subject, of, their, personal, worship, and, attention, a, feature, not, unheard, of, in, egyptian, history, with, fifth, dynasty, pharaohs, such, as, nyuserre, ini, proclaiming, to, be, sole, intermediaries, between, the, people, and, the, gods, osiris, and, ra, by, year, nine, of, his, reign, akhenaten, declared, that, aten, was, not, merely, the, supreme, god, but, the, only, worshipable, god, he, ordered, the, defacing, of, amun, s, temples, throughout, egypt, and, in, a, number, of, instances, inscriptions, of, the, plural, gods, were, also, removed, this, emphasized, the, changes, encouraged, by, the, new, regime, which, included, a, ban, on, images, with, the, exception, of, a, rayed, solar, disc, in, which, the, rays, appear, to, represent, the, unseen, spirit, of, aten, who, by, then, was, evidently, considered, not, merely, a, sun, god, but, rather, a, universal, deity, all, life, on, earth, depended, on, the, aten, and, the, visible, sunlight, representations, of, the, aten, were, always, accompanied, with, a, sort, of, hieroglyphic, footnote, stating, that, the, representation, of, the, sun, as, all, encompassing, creator, was, to, be, taken, as, just, that, a, representation, of, something, that, by, its, very, nature, as, something, transcending, creation, cannot, be, fully, or, adequately, represented, by, any, one, part, of, that, creation, aten, s, name, was, also, written, differently, starting, as, early, as, year, eight, or, as, late, as, year, fourteen, according, to, some, historians, from, living, re, horakhty, who, rejoices, in, the, horizon, in, his, name, shu, re, who, is, in, aten, the, god, s, name, changed, to, living, re, ruler, of, the, horizon, who, rejoices, in, his, name, of, re, the, father, who, has, returned, as, aten, removing, the, aten, s, connection, to, re, horakhty, and, shu, two, other, solar, deities, the, aten, thus, became, an, amalgamation, that, incorporated, the, attributes, and, beliefs, around, re, horakhty, universal, sun, god, and, shu, god, of, the, sky, and, manifestation, of, the, sunlight, akhenaten, s, atenist, beliefs, are, best, distilled, in, the, great, hymn, to, the, aten, the, hymn, was, discovered, in, the, tomb, of, ay, one, of, akhenaten, s, successors, though, egyptologists, believe, that, it, could, have, been, composed, by, akhenaten, himself, the, hymn, celebrates, the, sun, and, daylight, and, recounts, the, dangers, that, abound, when, the, sun, sets, it, tells, of, the, aten, as, a, sole, god, and, the, creator, of, all, life, who, recreates, life, every, day, at, sunrise, and, on, whom, everything, on, earth, depends, including, the, natural, world, people, s, lives, and, even, trade, and, commerce, in, one, passage, the, hymn, declares, o, sole, god, beside, whom, there, is, none, you, made, the, earth, as, you, wished, you, alone, the, hymn, also, states, that, akhenaten, is, the, only, intermediary, between, the, god, and, egyptians, and, the, only, one, who, can, understand, the, aten, you, are, in, my, heart, and, there, is, none, who, knows, you, except, your, son, some, debate, has, focused, on, the, extent, to, which, akhenaten, forced, his, religious, reforms, on, his, people, certainly, as, time, drew, on, he, revised, the, names, of, the, aten, and, other, religious, language, to, increasingly, exclude, references, to, other, gods, at, some, point, also, he, embarked, on, the, wide, scale, erasure, of, traditional, gods, names, especially, those, of, amun, some, of, his, court, changed, their, names, to, remove, them, from, the, patronage, of, other, gods, and, place, them, under, that, of, aten, or, ra, with, whom, akhenaten, equated, the, aten, yet, even, at, amarna, itself, some, courtiers, kept, such, names, as, ahmose, child, of, the, moon, god, the, owner, of, tomb, 3, and, the, sculptor, s, workshop, where, the, famous, nefertiti, bust, and, other, works, of, royal, portraiture, were, found, is, associated, with, an, artist, known, to, have, been, called, thutmose, child, of, thoth, an, overwhelmingly, large, number, of, faience, amulets, at, amarna, also, show, that, talismans, of, the, household, and, childbirth, gods, bes, and, taweret, the, eye, of, horus, and, amulets, of, other, traditional, deities, were, openly, worn, by, its, citizens, indeed, a, cache, of, royal, jewelry, found, buried, near, the, amarna, royal, tombs, now, in, the, national, museum, of, scotland, includes, a, finger, ring, referring, to, mut, the, wife, of, amun, such, evidence, suggests, that, though, akhenaten, shifted, funding, away, from, traditional, temples, his, policies, were, fairly, tolerant, until, some, point, perhaps, a, particular, event, as, yet, unknown, toward, the, end, of, the, reign, archaeological, discoveries, at, akhetaten, show, that, many, ordinary, residents, of, this, city, chose, to, gouge, or, chisel, out, all, references, to, the, god, amun, on, even, minor, personal, items, that, they, owned, such, as, commemorative, scarabs, or, make, up, pots, perhaps, for, fear, of, being, accused, of, having, amunist, sympathies, references, to, amenhotep, iii, akhenaten, s, father, were, partly, erased, since, they, contained, the, traditional, amun, form, of, his, name, nebmaatre, amunhotep, following, akhenaten, s, death, egypt, gradually, returned, to, its, traditional, polytheistic, religion, partly, because, of, how, closely, associated, the, aten, became, with, akhenaten, atenism, likely, stayed, dominant, through, the, reigns, of, akhenaten, s, immediate, successors, smenkhkare, and, neferneferuaten, as, well, as, early, in, the, reign, of, tutankhaten, for, some, years, the, worship, of, aten, and, a, resurgent, worship, of, amun, coexisted, over, time, however, akhenaten, s, successors, starting, with, tutankhaten, took, steps, to, distance, themselves, from, atenism, tutankhaten, and, his, wife, ankhesenpaaten, dropped, the, aten, from, their, names, and, changed, them, to, tutankhamun, and, ankhesenamun, respectively, amun, was, restored, as, the, supreme, deity, tutankhamun, reestablished, the, temples, of, the, other, gods, as, the, pharaoh, propagated, on, his, restoration, stela, he, reorganized, this, land, restoring, its, customs, to, those, of, the, time, of, re, he, renewed, the, gods, mansions, and, fashioned, all, their, images, he, raised, up, their, temples, and, created, their, statues, when, he, had, sought, out, the, gods, precincts, which, were, in, ruins, in, this, land, he, refounded, them, just, as, they, had, been, since, the, time, of, the, first, primeval, age, additionally, tutankhamun, s, building, projects, at, thebes, and, karnak, used, talatat, s, from, akhenaten, s, buildings, which, implies, that, tutankhamun, might, have, started, to, demolish, temples, dedicated, to, the, aten, aten, temples, continued, to, be, torn, down, under, ay, and, horemheb, tutankhamun, s, successors, and, the, last, pharaohs, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, horemheb, might, also, have, ordered, the, demolition, of, akhetaten, akhenaten, s, capital, city, further, underlining, the, break, with, aten, worship, horemheb, claimed, to, have, been, chosen, to, rule, by, the, god, horus, finally, seti, i, the, second, pharaoh, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, ordered, the, name, of, amun, to, be, restored, on, inscriptions, where, it, had, been, removed, or, replaced, by, aten, styles, of, art, that, flourished, during, the, reigns, of, akhenaten, and, his, immediate, successors, known, as, amarna, art, are, markedly, different, from, the, traditional, art, of, ancient, egypt, representations, are, more, realistic, expressionistic, and, naturalistic, especially, in, depictions, of, animals, plants, and, people, and, convey, more, action, and, movement, for, both, non, royal, and, royal, individuals, than, the, traditionally, static, representations, in, traditional, art, a, pharaoh, s, divine, nature, was, expressed, by, repose, even, immobility, the, portrayals, of, akhenaten, himself, greatly, differ, from, the, depictions, of, other, pharaohs, traditionally, the, portrayal, of, pharaohs, and, the, egyptian, ruling, class, was, idealized, and, they, were, shown, in, stereotypically, beautiful, fashion, as, youthful, and, athletic, however, akhenaten, s, portrayals, are, unconventional, and, unflattering, with, a, sagging, stomach, broad, hips, thin, legs, thick, thighs, large, almost, feminine, breasts, a, thin, exaggeratedly, long, face, and, thick, lips, based, on, akhenaten, s, and, his, family, s, unusual, artistic, representations, including, potential, depictions, of, gynecomastia, and, androgyny, some, have, argued, that, the, pharaoh, and, his, family, have, either, had, aromatase, excess, syndrome, and, sagittal, craniosynostosis, syndrome, or, antley, bixler, syndrome, in, 2010, results, published, from, genetic, studies, on, akhenaten, s, purported, mummy, did, not, find, signs, of, gynecomastia, or, antley, bixler, syndrome, although, these, results, have, since, been, questioned, arguing, instead, for, a, symbolic, interpretation, dominic, montserrat, in, akhenaten, history, fantasy, and, ancient, egypt, states, that, there, is, now, a, broad, consensus, among, egyptologists, that, the, exaggerated, forms, of, akhenaten, s, physical, portrayal, are, not, to, be, read, literally, because, the, god, aten, was, referred, to, as, the, mother, and, father, of, all, humankind, montserrat, and, others, suggest, that, akhenaten, was, made, to, look, androgynous, in, artwork, as, a, symbol, of, the, androgyny, of, the, aten, this, required, a, symbolic, gathering, of, all, the, attributes, of, the, creator, god, into, the, physical, body, of, the, king, himself, which, will, display, on, earth, the, aten, s, multiple, life, giving, functions, akhenaten, claimed, the, title, the, unique, one, of, re, and, he, may, have, directed, his, artists, to, contrast, him, with, the, common, people, through, a, radical, departure, from, the, idealized, traditional, pharaoh, image, depictions, of, other, members, of, the, court, especially, members, of, the, royal, family, are, also, exaggerated, stylized, and, overall, different, from, traditional, art, significantly, and, for, the, only, time, in, the, history, of, egyptian, royal, art, the, pharaoh, s, family, life, is, depicted, the, royal, family, is, shown, mid, action, in, relaxed, casual, and, intimate, situations, taking, part, in, decidedly, naturalistic, activities, showing, affection, for, each, other, such, as, holding, hands, and, kissing, nefertiti, also, appears, both, beside, the, king, and, alone, or, with, her, daughters, in, actions, usually, reserved, for, a, pharaoh, such, as, smiting, the, enemy, a, traditional, depiction, of, male, pharaohs, this, suggests, that, she, enjoyed, unusual, status, for, a, queen, early, artistic, representations, of, her, tend, to, be, indistinguishable, from, her, husband, s, except, by, her, regalia, but, soon, after, the, move, to, the, new, capital, nefertiti, begins, to, be, depicted, with, features, specific, to, her, questions, remain, whether, the, beauty, of, nefertiti, is, portraiture, or, idealism, akhenaten, s, status, as, a, religious, revolutionary, has, led, to, much, speculation, ranging, from, scholarly, hypotheses, to, non, academic, fringe, theories, although, some, believe, the, religion, he, introduced, was, mostly, monotheistic, many, others, see, akhenaten, as, a, practitioner, of, an, aten, monolatry, as, he, did, not, actively, deny, the, existence, of, other, gods, he, simply, refrained, from, worshiping, any, but, the, aten, the, idea, that, akhenaten, was, the, pioneer, of, a, monotheistic, religion, that, later, became, judaism, has, been, considered, by, various, scholars, one, of, the, first, to, mention, this, was, sigmund, freud, the, founder, of, psychoanalysis, in, his, book, moses, and, monotheism, basing, his, arguments, on, his, belief, that, the, exodus, story, was, historical, freud, argued, that, moses, had, been, an, atenist, priest, who, was, forced, to, leave, egypt, with, his, followers, after, akhenaten, s, death, freud, argued, that, akhenaten, was, striving, to, promote, monotheism, something, that, the, biblical, moses, was, able, to, achieve, following, the, publication, of, his, book, the, concept, entered, popular, consciousness, and, serious, research, freud, commented, on, the, connection, between, adonai, the, egyptian, aten, and, the, syrian, divine, name, of, adonis, as, stemming, from, a, common, root, in, this, he, was, following, the, argument, of, egyptologist, arthur, weigall, jan, assmann, s, opinion, is, that, aten, and, adonai, are, not, linguistically, related, there, are, strong, similarities, between, akhenaten, s, great, hymn, to, the, aten, and, the, biblical, psalm, 104, but, there, is, debate, as, to, relationship, implied, by, this, similarity, others, have, likened, some, aspects, of, akhenaten, s, relationship, with, the, aten, to, the, relationship, in, christian, tradition, between, jesus, christ, and, god, particularly, interpretations, that, emphasize, a, more, monotheistic, interpretation, of, atenism, than, a, henotheistic, one, donald, b, redford, has, noted, that, some, have, viewed, akhenaten, as, a, harbinger, of, jesus, after, all, akhenaten, did, call, himself, the, son, of, the, sole, god, thine, only, son, that, came, forth, from, thy, body, james, henry, breasted, likened, him, to, jesus, arthur, weigall, saw, him, as, a, failed, precursor, of, christ, and, thomas, mann, saw, him, as, right, on, the, way, and, yet, not, the, right, one, for, the, way, although, scholars, like, brian, fagan, 2015, and, robert, alter, 2018, have, re, opened, the, debate, in, 1997, redford, concluded, before, much, of, the, archaeological, evidence, from, thebes, and, from, tell, el, amarna, became, available, wishful, thinking, sometimes, turned, akhenaten, into, a, humane, teacher, of, the, true, god, a, mentor, of, moses, a, christlike, figure, a, philosopher, before, his, time, but, these, imaginary, creatures, are, now, fading, away, as, the, historical, reality, gradually, emerges, there, is, little, or, no, evidence, to, support, the, notion, that, akhenaten, was, a, progenitor, of, the, full, blown, monotheism, that, we, find, in, the, bible, the, monotheism, of, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, new, testament, had, its, own, separate, development, one, that, began, more, than, half, a, millennium, after, the, pharaoh, s, death, the, unconventional, portrayals, of, akhenaten, different, from, the, traditional, athletic, norm, in, the, portrayal, of, pharaohs, have, led, egyptologists, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, to, suppose, that, akhenaten, had, some, kind, of, genetic, abnormality, various, illnesses, have, been, put, forward, with, fr, hlich, s, syndrome, or, marfan, syndrome, being, mentioned, most, commonly, cyril, aldred, following, up, earlier, arguments, of, grafton, elliot, smith, and, james, strachey, suggested, that, akhenaten, may, have, had, fr, hlich, s, syndrome, on, the, basis, of, his, long, jaw, and, his, feminine, appearance, however, this, is, unlikely, because, this, disorder, results, in, sterility, and, akhenaten, is, known, to, have, fathered, numerous, children, his, children, are, repeatedly, portrayed, through, years, of, archaeological, and, iconographic, evidence, burridge, suggested, that, akhenaten, may, have, had, marfan, syndrome, which, unlike, fr, hlich, s, does, not, result, in, mental, impairment, or, sterility, people, with, marfan, syndrome, tend, towards, tallness, with, a, long, thin, face, elongated, skull, overgrown, ribs, a, funnel, or, pigeon, chest, a, high, curved, or, slightly, cleft, palate, and, larger, pelvis, with, enlarged, thighs, and, spindly, calves, symptoms, that, appear, in, some, depictions, of, akhenaten, marfan, syndrome, is, a, dominant, characteristic, which, means, those, affected, have, a, 50, chance, of, passing, it, on, to, their, children, however, dna, tests, on, tutankhamun, in, 2010, proved, negative, for, marfan, syndrome, by, the, early, 21st, century, most, egyptologists, argued, that, akhenaten, s, portrayals, are, not, the, results, of, a, genetic, or, medical, condition, but, rather, should, be, interpreted, as, stylized, portrayals, influenced, by, atenism, akhenaten, was, made, to, look, androgynous, in, artwork, as, a, symbol, of, the, androgyny, of, the, aten, akhenaten, s, life, accomplishments, and, legacy, have, been, preserved, and, depicted, in, many, ways, and, he, has, figured, in, works, of, both, high, and, popular, culture, since, his, rediscovery, in, the, 19th, century, ad, akhenaten, alongside, cleopatra, and, alexander, the, great, is, among, the, most, often, popularized, and, fictionalized, ancient, historical, figures, on, page, amarna, novels, most, often, take, one, of, two, forms, they, are, either, a, bildungsroman, focusing, on, akhenaten, s, psychological, and, moral, growth, as, it, relates, to, establishing, atenism, and, akhetaten, as, well, as, his, struggles, against, the, theban, amun, cult, alternatively, his, literary, depictions, focus, on, the, aftermath, of, his, reign, and, religion, a, dividing, line, also, exists, between, depictions, of, akhenaten, from, before, the, 1920s, and, since, when, more, and, more, archeological, discoveries, started, to, provide, artists, with, material, evidence, about, his, life, and, times, thus, before, the, 1920s, akhenaten, had, appeared, as, a, ghost, a, spectral, figure, in, art, while, since, he, has, become, realistic, material, and, tangible, examples, of, the, former, include, the, romance, novels, in, the, tombs, of, the, kings, 1910, by, lilian, bagnall, the, first, appearance, by, akhenaten, and, his, wife, nefertiti, in, fiction, and, a, wife, out, of, egypt, 1913, and, there, was, a, king, in, egypt, 1918, by, norma, lorimer, examples, of, the, latter, include, akhnaton, king, of, egypt, 1924, by, dmitry, merezhkovsky, joseph, and, his, brothers, 1933, 1943, by, thomas, mann, akhnaton, 1973, by, agatha, christie, and, akhenaten, dweller, in, truth, 1985, by, naguib, mahfouz, akhenaten, also, appears, in, the, egyptian, 1945, by, mika, waltari, which, was, adapted, into, the, movie, the, egyptian, 1953, in, this, movie, akhenaten, portrayed, by, michael, wilding, appears, to, represent, jesus, christ, and, his, followers, proto, christians, a, sexualized, image, of, akhenaten, building, on, early, western, interest, in, the, pharaoh, s, androgynous, depictions, perceived, potential, homosexuality, and, identification, with, oedipal, storytelling, also, influenced, modern, works, of, art, the, two, most, notable, portrayals, are, akenaten, 1975, an, unfilmed, screenplay, by, derek, jarman, and, akhnaten, 1984, an, opera, by, philip, glass, both, were, influenced, by, the, unproven, and, scientifically, unsupported, theories, of, immanuel, velikovsky, who, equated, oedipus, with, akhenaten, although, glass, specifically, denies, his, personal, belief, in, velikovsky, s, oedipus, theory, or, caring, about, its, historical, validity, instead, being, drawn, to, its, potential, theatricality, in, the, 21st, century, akhenaten, appeared, as, an, antagonist, in, comic, books, and, video, games, for, example, he, is, the, major, antagonist, in, limited, comic, book, series, marvel, the, end, 2003, in, this, series, akhenaten, is, abducted, by, an, alien, order, in, the, 14th, century, bc, and, reappears, on, modern, earth, seeking, to, restore, his, kingdom, he, is, opposed, by, essentially, all, of, the, other, superheroes, and, supervillains, in, the, marvel, comic, book, universe, and, is, eventually, defeated, by, thanos, additionally, akhenaten, appears, as, the, enemy, in, the, assassin, s, creed, origins, the, curse, of, the, pharaohs, downloadable, content, 2017, and, must, be, defeated, to, remove, his, curse, on, thebes, his, afterlife, takes, the, form, of, aten, a, location, that, draws, heavily, on, the, architecture, of, the, city, of, amarna, american, death, metal, band, nile, depicted, akhenaten, s, judgement, punishment, and, erasure, from, history, at, the, hands, of, the, pantheon, that, he, replaced, with, aten, in, the, song, cast, down, the, heretic, from, their, 2005, album, annihilation, of, the, wicked, he, was, also, featured, on, the, cover, artwork, of, their, 2009, album, those, whom, the, gods, detest, hoffmeier, 2005, p, 239, there, has, been, some, debate, whether, the, similarities, direct, or, indirect, borrowing, it, is, unlikely, that, the, israelite, who, composed, psalm, 104, borrowed, directly, from, the, sublime, egyptian, hymn, to, the, aten, as, stager, has, recently, claimed, alter, 2018, p, 54, i, think, there, may, be, some, likelihood, however, unprovable, that, our, psalmist, was, familiar, with, at, least, an, intermediate, version, of, akhenaton, s, hymn, and, adopted, some, elements, from, it, brown, 2014, p, 61, 73, the, question, of, the, relationship, between, egyptian, hymns, and, the, psalms, remains, open, day, 2014, pp, 22, 23, a, significant, part, of, the, rest, of, psalm, 104, esp, vv, 20, 30, is, dependent, on, akhenaten, s, hymn, to, the, sun, god, aten, these, parallels, almost, all, come, in, the, same, order, day, 2013, pp, 223, 224, this, dependence, is, confined, to, vv, 20, 30, here, the, evidence, is, particularly, impressive, since, we, have, six, parallels, with, akhenaten, s, hymn, occurring, in, the, identical, order, with, one, exception, landes, 2011, pp, 155, 178, the, hymn, to, aten, quoted, as, epigraph, to, this, chapter, replicates, the, intense, religiosity, and, even, the, language, of, the, hebrew, psalm, 104, indeed, most, egyptologists, argue, that, this, hymn, inspired, the, psalm, for, some, the, relationship, to, hebraic, monotheism, seems, extremely, close, including, the, nearly, verbatim, passages, in, psalm, 104, and, the, hymn, to, aten, found, in, one, of, the, tombs, at, akhetaten, shaw, 2004, p, 19, an, intriguing, direct, literary, and, perhaps, religious, link, between, egypt, and, the, bible, is, psalm, 104, which, has, strong, similarities, with, a, hymn, to, the, aten
