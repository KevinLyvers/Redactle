up, earning, about, 600, 000, for, winchester, 73, significantly, more, than, his, usual, fee, and, other, stars, quickly, capitalized, on, this, new, way, of, doing, business, which, further, undermined, the, decaying, studio, system, stewart, chose, mann, to, direct, and, the, film, gave, him, the, idea, of, redefining, his, screen, persona, through, the, western, genre, in, the, film, stewart, is, a, tough, vengeful, sharpshooter, the, winner, of, a, prized, rifle, that, is, stolen, and, passes, through, many, hands, until, the, showdown, between, him, and, his, brother,

all, the, rest, that, a, virtually, brand, new, experience, is, still, in, store, for, even, those, who, saw, the, play, while, variety, called, him, perfect, in, the, role, john, mccarten, of, the, new, yorker, stated, that, although, he, doesn, t, bring, his, part, to, the, battered, authority, of, frank, fay, he, nevertheless, succeeds, in, making, plausible, the, notion, that, harvey, the, rabbit, would, accept, him, as, a, pal, stewart, later, stated, that, he, was, dissatisfied, with, his, performance, stating, i, played, him, a, little, too, dreamily, a, little, too, cute, cute,

on, to, win, the, academy, award, for, best, picture, critics, were, curious, why, stewart, had, taken, such, a, small, out, of, character, role, he, responded, that, he, was, inspired, by, lon, chaney, s, ability, to, disguise, himself, while, letting, his, character, emerge, in, the, same, year, stewart, starred, in, a, critically, and, commercially, failed, biopic, carbine, williams, 1952,

violence, first, hand, and, struggles, to, control, it, the, stewart, mann, collaborations, laid, the, foundation, for, many, of, the, westerns, of, the, 1950s, and, remain, popular, today, for, their, grittier, more, realistic, depiction, of, the, classic, movie, genre, in, addition, stewart, starred, in, the, western, radio, show, the, six, shooter, for, its, one, season, run, from, 1953, to, 1954, he, and, mann, also, collaborated, on, films, outside, the, western, genre, such, as, thunder, bay, 1953, and, the, glenn, miller, story, 1954, the, latter, a, critically, acclaimed, biopic,

and, comes, to, believe, that, he, has, witnessed, a, murder, limited, by, his, wheelchair, stewart, had, to, react, to, what, his, character, sees, with, mostly, facial, responses, like, mann, hitchcock, uncovered, new, depths, to, stewart, s, acting, showing, a, protagonist, confronting, his, fears, and, repressed, desires, although, most, of, the, initial, acclaim, for, rear, window, was, directed, towards, hitchcock, critic, vincent, canby, later, described, stewart, s, performance, in, it, as, grand, and, stated, that, longtime, star, status, in, hollywood, has, always, obscured, recognition, of, his, talent, 1954, was, a, landmark, year, in, stewart, s, career, in, terms, of, audience, success, and, he, topped, look, magazine, s, list, of, the, most, popular, movie, stars,

film, the, man, who, knew, too, much, 1956, the, film, was, another, success, even, though, critics, preferred, the, first, version, hitchcock, himself, considered, his, remake, superior, stewart, s, next, film, billy, wilder, s, the, spirit, of, st, louis, 1957, saw, him, star, as, his, young, adulthood, hero, charles, lindbergh, it, was, a, big, budget, production, with, elaborate, special,

later, become, considered, one, of, hitchcock, s, key, works, and, was, ranked, the, greatest, film, ever, made, by, the, sight, sound, critics, poll, in, 2012, it, was, met, with, unenthusiastic, reviews, and, poor, box, office, receipts, upon, its, release, regardless, several, critics, complimented, stewart, for, his, performance, with, bosley, crowther, noting, mr, stewart, as, usual, manages, to, act, awfully, tense, in, a, casual, way, hitchcock, blamed, the, film, s, failure, on, stewart, being, too, old, to, convincingly, be, novak, s, love, interest, he, was, fifty, years, old, at, the, time, and, had, begun, wearing, a, silver, hairpiece, in, his, movies, consequently, hitchcock, cast, cary, grant, in, his, next, film, north, by, northwest, 1959, a, role, stewart,

poor, reviews, and, resulted, in, a, box, office, failure, however, according, to, film, scholar, david, bingham, by, the, early, 1950s, stewart, s, personality, was, so, credible, and, well, established, that, his, choice, of, role, no, longer, affected, his, popularity, stewart, ended, the, decade, with, otto, preminger, s, realistic, courtroom, drama, anatomy, of, a, murder, 1959, and,

awkward, unlike, many, actors, who, developed, their, on, screen, persona, over, time, stewart, s, on, screen, persona, was, recognizable, as, early, as, art, trouble, 1934, his, uncredited, debut, film, role, where, stewart, was, relaxed, and, comfortable, on, screen, he, portrayed, this, persona, most, strongly, in, the, 1940s, but, maintained, a, classic, everyman, persona, throughout, his, career, film, scholar, dennis, bingham, wrote, that, stewart, was, both, a, personality, star, and, a, chameleon, who, evoked, both, masculine, and, feminine, qualities, consequently, it, was, difficult, for, filmmakers, to, sell, stewart, as, the, stereotypical, leading, man, and, thus, he, became, a, star, in, films, that, capitalized, on, his, sexual, ambivalence, stewart, s, asexual, persona, as, a, leading, man, was, unusual, for, the, time, period, for, an, actor, who, was, not, mainly, a, comedian, however, during, his, career, stewart, the, furthest, extremes, of, american, masculinity, from, reaganite, militarist, patriotism, to, hitchcockian, perversity, according, to, roger, ebert, stewart, s, pre, world, war, ii, characters, were, usually, likable, but, in, postwar, years, directors, chose, to, cast, stewart, in, darker, roles, such, as, jeffries, in, rear, window, ebert, put, this, into, contemporary, perspective, by, asking, what, would, it, feel, like, to, see, in, a, bizarre, and, twisted, light, explaining, that, it, is, jarring, to, see, a, beloved, everyman, persona, such, as, stewart, in, dark, roles, furthermore, jonathan, rosenbaum, explained, that, since, audiences, were, more, interested, in, stewart, s, star, persona, and, aura, than, his, characters, this, makes, it, more, striking, when, anthony, mann, and, alfred, hitchcock, periodically, explore, the, neurotic, and, obsessive, aspects, of, stewart, s, persona, to, play, against, his, all, american, innocence, and, earnestness, film, scholar, john, belton, argued, that, rather, than, playing, characters, in, his, films, stewart, often, played, his, own, screen, persona, he, had, difficulty, playing, famous, historical, personages, because, his, persona, could, not, accommodate, the, historical, character, belton, explained, that, james, stewart, is, more, james, stewart, than, glenn, miller, in, the, glenn, miller, story, 1954, or, charles, lindbergh, in, the, spirit, of, st, louis, 1957, moreover, jonathan, rosenbaum, continued, that, stewart, s, pre, existing, life, size, persona, in, winchester, 73, helped, to, shape, and, determine, the, impact, of, in, on, the, other, hand, stewart, has, been, described, as, a, character, actor, who, went, through, several, distinct, career, phases, according, to, film, scholar, amy, lawrence, the, main, elements, of, stewart, s, persona, a, propensity, for, physical, and, spiritual, suffering, lingering, fears, of, inadequacy, were, established, by, frank, capra, in, the, 1930s, and, were, enhanced, through, his, later, work, with, hitchcock, and, mann, john, belton, explained, that, james, stewart, evolves, from, the, naive, small, town, populist, hero, of, frank, capra, s, 1930s, comedies, to, the, bitter, anxiety, ridden, vengeance, obsessed, cowboy, in, anthony, mann, s, 1950s, westerns, and, the, disturbed, voyeur, and, sexual, fetishist, in, alfred, hitchcock, s, 1950s, suspense, thrillers, during, his, postwar, career, stewart, usually, avoided, appearing, in, comedies, harvey, and, take, her, she, s, mine, being, exceptions, he, played, many, different, types, of, characters, including, manipulative, cynical, obsessive, or, crazy, characters, stewart, found, that, acting, allowed, him, to, express, the, fear, and, anxiety, that, he, could, not, express, during, the, war, his, post, war, performances, were, received, well, by, audiences, because, they, could, still, see, the, innocent, pre, war, stewart, underneath, his, dark, roles, according, to, andrew, sarris, stewart, was, the, most, complete, actor, personality, in, the, american, cinema, selected, credits, stewart, is, remembered, for, portraying, idealist, everyman, characters, in, his, films, his, heroism, on, screen, and, devotion, to, his, family, made, him, relatable, and, representative, of, the, american, ideal, leading, stewart, to, be, considered, one, of, the, best, loved, figures, in, twentieth, century, american, popular, culture, according, to, film, scholar, dennis, bingham, his, ability, to, play, even, symbolize, honesty, and, american, ideals, made, him, an, icon, into, whose, mold, later, male, stars, tried, to, pour, themselves, similarly, film, scholar, james, naremore, has, called, stewart, the, most, successful, actor, of, the, common, man, in, the, history, of, movies, and, the, most, intensely, emotional, leading, man, to, emerge, from, the, studio, system, who, could, cry, on, screen, without, losing, his, masculinity, david, thomson, has, explained, stewart, s, appeal, by, stating, that, we, wanted, to, be, him, and, we, wanted, to, be, liked, by, him, while, roger, ebert, has, stated, that, whether, he, played, everyman, or, everyman, s, hidden, psyche, stewart, was, an, innately, likable, man, whose, face, loping, gait, and, distinctive, drawl, became, famous, all, over, the, world, among, stewart, s, most, recognizable, qualities, was, his, manner, of, speaking, with, a, hesitant, drawl, according, to, film, scholar, tim, palmer, stewart, s, legacy, rests, on, his, roles, as, the, nervous, idealist, standing, trial, for, and, gaining, stature, from, the, sincerity, of, his, beliefs, while, his, emotive, convictions, are, put, to, the, test, film, critic, david, ansen, wrote, about, stewart, s, appeal, as, a, person, in, addition, to, his, appeal, as, an, actor, ansen, retold, a, story, in, which, jack, warner, upon, being, told, about, ronald, reagan, s, presidential, ambitions, said, no, jimmy, stewart, for, president, ronald, reagan, for, best, friend, ansen, further, explained, that, stewart, was, the, ultimate, trustworthy, movie, star, in, contrast, to, his, popularly, remembered, all, american, screen, persona, film, critics, and, scholars, have, tended, to, emphasize, that, his, performances, also, showed, a, dark, side, according, to, film, scholar, murray, pomerance, the, other, jimmy, stewart, was, a, different, type, altogether, a, repressed, and, neurotic, man, buried, beneath, an, apparently, calm, facade, but, ready, at, any, moment, to, explode, with, vengeful, anxiety, and, anger, or, else, with, deeply, twisted, and, constrained, passions, that, could, never, match, up, with, cheery, personality, of, the, alter, ego, bingham, has, described, him, as, having, two, coequal, personas, the, earnest, idealist, the, nostalgic, figure, of, the, homespun, boy, next, door, and, the, risk, taking, actor, who, probably, performed, in, films, for, more, canonical, auteurs, than, any, other, american, star, according, to, him, it, is, this, complexity, and, his, ambiguous, masculinity, and, sexuality, with, which, he, approached, his, roles, that, characterized, his, persona, naremore, has, stated, that, there, was, a, troubled, cranky, slightly, repressed, feeling, in, behavior, and, thomson, has, written, that, it, was, his, dark, side, that, produced, great, cinema, stewart, was, one, of, the, most, sought, after, actors, in, 1950s, hollywood, proving, that, independent, actors, could, be, successful, in, the, film, industry, which, led, more, actors, in, hollywood, to, forego, studio, contracts, according, to, bingham, stewart, marked, the, transition, between, the, studio, period, and, the, era, of, free, lance, actors, independent, production, and, powerful, talent, agents, that, made, possible, the, new, kind, of, star, of, the, late, 1960s, although, stewart, was, not, the, first, big, name, freelance, actor, his, mythic, sweetness, and, idealism, were, combined, with, eccentric, physical, equipment, and, capacity, as, an, actor, to, enact, emotion, anxiety, and, pain, enabled, him, to, succeed, in, both, the, studio, system, which, emphasized, the, star, as, a, real, person, and, the, skeptical, post, studio, era, a, number, of, stewart, s, films, have, become, classics, of, american, cinema, with, twelve, of, his, films, having, been, inducted,
