hippocrates, of, kos, h, p, k, r, t, i, z, greek, translit, hippokr, t, s, ho, k, ios, c, 460, c, 370, bc, also, known, as, hippocrates, ii, was, a, greek, physician, and, philosopher, of, the, classical, period, who, is, considered, one, of, the, most, outstanding, figures, in, the, history, of, medicine, he, is, traditionally, referred, to, as, the, father, of, medicine, in, recognition, of, his, lasting, contributions, to, the, field, such, as, the, use, of, prognosis, and, clinical, observation, the, systematic, categorization, of, diseases, and, the, however, misguided, formulation, of, humoral, theory, the, hippocratic, school, of, medicine, revolutionized, ancient, greek, medicine, establishing, it, as, a, discipline, distinct, from, other, fields, with, which, it, had, traditionally, been, associated, theurgy, and, philosophy, thus, establishing, medicine, as, a, profession, however, the, achievements, of, the, writers, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, the, practitioners, of, hippocratic, medicine, and, the, actions, of, hippocrates, himself, were, often, conflated, thus, very, little, is, known, about, what, hippocrates, actually, thought, wrote, and, did, hippocrates, is, commonly, portrayed, as, the, paragon, of, the, ancient, physician, and, credited, with, coining, the, hippocratic, oath, which, is, still, relevant, and, in, use, today, he, is, also, credited, with, greatly, advancing, the, systematic, study, of, clinical, medicine, summing, up, the, medical, knowledge, of, previous, schools, and, prescribing, practices, for, physicians, through, the, hippocratic, corpus, and, other, works, historians, agree, that, hippocrates, was, born, around, the, year, 460, bc, on, the, greek, island, of, kos, other, biographical, information, however, is, likely, to, be, untrue, soranus, of, ephesus, a, 2nd, century, greek, physician, was, hippocrates, s, first, biographer, and, is, the, source, of, most, personal, information, about, him, later, biographies, are, in, the, suda, of, the, 10th, century, ad, and, in, the, works, of, john, tzetzes, which, date, from, the, 12th, century, ad, hippocrates, is, mentioned, in, passing, in, the, writings, of, two, contemporaries, in, plato, s, dialogues, protagoras, and, phaedrus, and, in, aristotle, s, politics, all, of, which, date, from, the, 4th, century, bc, soranus, wrote, that, hippocrates, s, father, was, heraclides, a, physician, and, his, mother, was, praxitela, daughter, of, tizane, the, two, sons, of, hippocrates, thessalus, and, draco, and, his, son, in, law, polybus, were, his, students, according, to, galen, a, later, physician, polybus, was, hippocrates, s, true, successor, while, thessalus, and, draco, each, had, a, son, named, hippocrates, hippocrates, iii, and, iv, soranus, said, that, hippocrates, learned, medicine, from, his, father, and, grandfather, hippocrates, i, and, studied, other, subjects, with, democritus, and, gorgias, hippocrates, was, probably, trained, at, the, asklepieion, of, kos, and, took, lessons, from, the, thracian, physician, herodicus, of, selymbria, plato, mentions, hippocrates, in, two, of, his, dialogues, in, protagoras, plato, describes, hippocrates, as, hippocrates, of, kos, the, asclepiad, while, in, phaedrus, plato, suggests, that, hippocrates, the, asclepiad, thought, that, a, complete, knowledge, of, the, nature, of, the, body, was, necessary, for, medicine, hippocrates, taught, and, practiced, medicine, throughout, his, life, traveling, at, least, as, far, as, thessaly, thrace, and, the, sea, of, marmara, several, different, accounts, of, his, death, exist, he, died, probably, in, larissa, at, the, age, of, 83, 85, or, 90, though, some, say, he, lived, to, be, well, over, 100, it, is, thus, with, regard, to, the, disease, called, sacred, it, appears, to, me, to, be, nowise, more, divine, nor, more, sacred, than, other, diseases, but, has, a, natural, cause, from, the, originates, like, other, affections, men, regard, its, nature, and, cause, as, divine, from, ignorance, and, wonder, hippocrates, is, credited, as, the, first, person, to, believe, that, diseases, were, caused, naturally, not, because, of, superstition, and, gods, he, was, acknowledged, by, the, disciples, of, pythagoras, for, allying, philosophy, and, medicine, he, separated, the, discipline, of, medicine, from, religion, believing, and, arguing, that, disease, was, not, a, punishment, inflicted, by, the, gods, but, rather, the, product, of, environmental, factors, diet, and, living, habits, there, is, not, a, single, mention, of, a, mystical, illness, in, the, entirety, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, however, hippocrates, did, hold, many, convictions, that, were, based, on, incorrect, anatomy, and, physiology, such, as, humorism, ancient, greek, schools, of, medicine, were, split, into, the, knidian, and, koan, on, how, to, deal, with, disease, the, knidian, school, of, medicine, focused, on, diagnosis, medicine, at, the, time, of, hippocrates, knew, almost, nothing, of, human, anatomy, and, physiology, because, of, the, greek, taboo, forbidding, the, dissection, of, humans, the, knidian, school, consequently, failed, to, distinguish, when, one, disease, caused, many, possible, series, of, symptoms, the, hippocratic, school, or, koan, school, achieved, greater, success, by, applying, general, diagnoses, and, passive, treatments, its, focus, was, on, patient, care, and, prognosis, not, diagnosis, it, could, effectively, treat, diseases, and, allowed, for, a, great, development, in, clinical, practice, hippocratic, medicine, and, its, philosophy, are, far, removed, from, modern, medicine, in, which, the, physician, focuses, on, specific, diagnosis, and, specialized, treatment, both, of, which, were, espoused, by, the, knidian, school, this, shift, in, medical, thought, since, hippocrates, s, day, has, generated, serious, criticism, of, their, denunciations, for, example, the, french, doctor, m, s, houdart, called, the, hippocratic, treatment, a, meditation, upon, death, if, you, want, to, learn, about, the, health, of, a, population, look, at, the, air, they, breathe, the, water, they, drink, and, the, places, where, they, live, analogies, have, been, drawn, between, thucydides, historical, method, and, the, hippocratic, method, in, particular, the, notion, of, human, nature, as, a, way, of, explaining, foreseeable, repetitions, for, future, usefulness, for, other, times, or, for, other, cases, an, important, concept, in, hippocratic, medicine, was, that, of, a, crisis, a, point, in, the, progression, of, disease, at, which, either, the, illness, would, begin, to, triumph, and, the, patient, would, succumb, to, death, or, the, opposite, would, occur, and, natural, processes, would, make, the, patient, recover, after, a, crisis, a, relapse, might, follow, and, then, another, deciding, crisis, according, to, this, doctrine, crises, tend, to, occur, on, critical, days, which, were, supposed, to, be, a, fixed, time, after, the, contraction, of, a, disease, if, a, crisis, occurred, on, a, day, far, from, a, critical, day, a, relapse, might, be, expected, galen, believed, that, this, idea, originated, with, hippocrates, though, it, is, possible, that, it, predated, him, hippocratic, medicine, was, humble, and, passive, the, therapeutic, approach, was, based, on, the, healing, power, of, nature, vis, medicatrix, naturae, in, latin, according, to, this, doctrine, the, body, contains, within, itself, the, power, to, re, balance, the, four, humours, and, heal, itself, physis, hippocratic, therapy, focused, on, simply, easing, this, natural, process, to, this, end, hippocrates, believed, rest, and, immobilization, of, capital, importance, in, general, the, hippocratic, medicine, was, very, kind, to, the, patient, treatment, was, gentle, and, emphasized, keeping, the, patient, clean, and, sterile, for, example, only, clean, water, or, wine, were, ever, used, on, wounds, though, dry, treatment, was, preferable, soothing, balms, were, sometimes, employed, hippocrates, was, reluctant, to, administer, drugs, and, engage, in, specialized, treatment, that, might, prove, to, be, wrongly, chosen, generalized, therapy, followed, a, generalized, diagnosis, some, of, the, generalized, treatments, he, prescribed, are, fasting, and, the, consumption, of, a, mix, of, honey, and, vinegar, hippocrates, once, said, that, to, eat, when, you, are, sick, is, to, feed, your, sickness, however, potent, drugs, were, used, on, certain, occasions, this, passive, approach, was, very, successful, in, treating, relatively, simple, ailments, such, as, broken, bones, which, required, traction, to, stretch, the, skeletal, system, and, relieve, pressure, on, the, injured, area, the, hippocratic, bench, and, other, devices, were, used, to, this, end, in, hippocrates, s, time, it, was, thought, that, fever, was, a, disease, in, and, of, itself, hippocrates, treated, patients, with, fever, by, starving, them, out, believing, that, starving, the, fever, was, a, way, to, neutralize, the, disease, he, may, therefore, have, been, the, originator, of, the, idea, feed, a, cold, starve, a, fever, one, of, the, strengths, of, hippocratic, medicine, was, its, emphasis, on, prognosis, at, hippocrates, s, time, medicinal, therapy, was, quite, immature, and, often, the, best, thing, that, physicians, could, do, was, to, evaluate, an, illness, and, predict, its, likely, progression, based, upon, data, collected, in, detailed, case, histories, hippocratic, medicine, was, notable, for, its, strict, professionalism, discipline, and, rigorous, practice, the, hippocratic, work, on, the, physician, recommends, that, physicians, always, be, well, kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and, serious, the, hippocratic, physician, paid, careful, attention, to, all, aspects, of, his, practice, he, followed, detailed, specifications, for, lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning, of, the, patient, and, techniques, of, bandaging, and, splinting, in, the, ancient, operating, room, he, even, kept, his, fingernails, to, a, precise, length, the, hippocratic, school, gave, importance, to, the, clinical, doctrines, of, observation, and, documentation, these, doctrines, dictate, that, physicians, record, their, findings, and, their, medicinal, methods, in, a, very, clear, and, objective, manner, so, that, these, records, may, be, passed, down, and, employed, by, other, physicians, hippocrates, made, careful, regular, note, of, many, symptoms, including, complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and, excretions, he, is, said, to, have, measured, a, patient, s, pulse, when, taking, a, case, history, to, discover, whether, the, patient, was, lying, hippocrates, extended, clinical, observations, into, family, history, and, environment, to, him, medicine, owes, the, art, of, clinical, inspection, and, observation, hippocrates, and, his, followers, were, the, first, to, describe, many, diseases, and, medical, conditions, he, is, given, credit, for, the, first, description, of, clubbing, of, the, fingers, an, important, diagnostic, sign, in, chronic, lung, disease, lung, cancer, and, cyanotic, heart, disease, for, this, reason, clubbed, fingers, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, hippocratic, fingers, hippocrates, was, also, the, first, physician, to, describe, hippocratic, face, in, prognosis, shakespeare, famously, alludes, to, this, description, when, writing, of, falstaff, s, death, in, act, ii, scene, iii, of, henry, v, hippocrates, began, to, categorize, illnesses, as, acute, chronic, endemic, and, epidemic, and, use, terms, such, as, exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and, convalescence, another, of, hippocrates, s, major, contributions, may, be, found, in, his, descriptions, of, the, symptomatology, physical, findings, surgical, treatment, and, prognosis, of, thoracic, empyema, i, e, suppuration, of, the, lining, of, the, chest, cavity, his, teachings, remain, relevant, to, present, day, students, of, pulmonary, medicine, and, surgery, hippocrates, was, the, first, documented, chest, surgeon, and, his, findings, and, techniques, while, crude, such, as, the, use, of, lead, pipes, to, drain, chest, wall, abscess, are, still, valid, the, hippocratic, school, of, medicine, described, well, the, ailments, of, the, human, rectum, and, the, treatment, thereof, despite, the, school, s, poor, theory, of, medicine, hemorrhoids, for, instance, though, believed, to, be, caused, by, an, excess, of, bile, and, phlegm, were, treated, by, hippocratic, physicians, in, relatively, advanced, ways, cautery, and, excision, are, described, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, in, addition, to, the, preferred, methods, ligating, the, hemorrhoids, and, drying, them, with, a, hot, iron, other, treatments, such, as, applying, various, salves, are, suggested, as, well, today, treatment, still, includes, burning, strangling, and, excising, also, some, of, the, fundamental, concepts, of, proctoscopy, outlined, in, the, corpus, are, still, in, use, for, example, the, uses, of, the, rectal, speculum, a, common, medical, device, are, discussed, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, this, constitutes, the, earliest, recorded, reference, to, endoscopy, hippocrates, often, used, lifestyle, modifications, such, as, diet, and, exercise, to, treat, diseases, such, as, diabetes, what, is, today, called, lifestyle, medicine, two, popular, but, likely, misquoted, attributions, to, hippocrates, are, let, food, be, your, medicine, and, medicine, be, your, food, and, walking, is, man, s, best, medicine, both, appear, to, be, misquotations, and, their, exact, origins, remain, unknown, in, 2017, researchers, claimed, that, while, conducting, restorations, on, the, saint, catherine, s, monastery, in, south, sinai, they, found, a, manuscript, which, contains, a, medical, recipe, of, hippocrates, the, manuscript, also, contains, three, recipes, with, pictures, of, herbs, that, were, created, by, an, anonymous, scribe, the, hippocratic, corpus, latin, corpus, hippocraticum, is, a, collection, of, around, seventy, early, medical, works, collected, in, alexandrian, greece, it, is, written, in, ionic, greek, the, question, of, whether, hippocrates, himself, was, the, author, of, any, of, the, treatises, in, the, corpus, has, not, been, conclusively, answered, but, modern, debate, revolves, around, only, a, few, of, the, treatises, seen, as, potentially, authored, by, him, because, of, the, variety, of, subjects, writing, styles, and, apparent, date, of, construction, the, hippocratic, corpus, could, not, have, been, written, by, one, person, ermerins, numbers, the, authors, at, nineteen, the, corpus, came, to, be, known, by, his, name, because, of, his, fame, possibly, all, medical, works, were, classified, under, hippocrates, by, a, librarian, in, alexandria, the, volumes, were, probably, produced, by, his, students, and, followers, the, hippocratic, corpus, contains, textbooks, lectures, research, notes, and, philosophical, essays, on, various, subjects, in, medicine, in, no, particular, order, these, works, were, written, for, different, audiences, both, specialists, and, laymen, and, were, sometimes, written, from, opposing, viewpoints, significant, contradictions, can, be, found, between, works, in, the, corpus, among, the, treatises, of, the, corpus, are, the, hippocratic, oath, the, book, of, prognostics, on, regimen, in, acute, diseases, aphorisms, on, airs, waters, and, places, instruments, of, reduction, on, the, sacred, disease, etc, the, hippocratic, oath, a, seminal, document, on, the, ethics, of, medical, practice, was, attributed, to, hippocrates, in, antiquity, although, new, information, shows, it, may, have, been, written, after, his, death, this, is, probably, the, most, famous, document, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, recently, the, authenticity, of, the, document, s, author, has, come, under, scrutiny, while, the, oath, is, rarely, used, in, its, original, form, today, it, serves, as, a, foundation, for, other, similar, oaths, and, laws, that, define, good, medical, practice, and, morals, such, derivatives, are, regularly, taken, by, modern, medical, graduates, about, to, enter, medical, practice, although, hippocrates, neither, founded, the, school, of, medicine, named, after, him, nor, wrote, most, of, the, treatises, attributed, to, him, he, is, traditionally, regarded, as, the, father, of, medicine, his, contributions, revolutionized, the, practice, of, medicine, but, after, his, death, the, advancement, stalled, so, revered, was, hippocrates, that, his, teachings, were, largely, taken, as, too, great, to, be, improved, upon, and, no, significant, advancements, of, his, methods, were, made, for, a, long, time, the, centuries, after, hippocrates, s, death, were, marked, as, much, by, retrograde, movement, as, by, further, advancement, for, instance, after, the, hippocratic, period, the, practice, of, taking, clinical, case, histories, died, out, according, to, fielding, garrison, after, hippocrates, another, significant, physician, was, galen, a, greek, who, lived, from, ad, 129, to, ad, 200, galen, perpetuated, the, tradition, of, hippocratic, medicine, making, some, advancements, but, also, some, regressions, in, the, middle, ages, the, islamic, world, adopted, hippocratic, methods, and, developed, new, medical, technologies, after, the, european, renaissance, hippocratic, methods, were, revived, in, western, europe, and, even, further, expanded, in, the, 19th, century, notable, among, those, who, employed, hippocrates, s, rigorous, clinical, techniques, were, thomas, sydenham, william, heberden, jean, martin, charcot, and, william, osler, henri, huchard, a, french, physician, said, that, these, revivals, make, up, the, whole, history, of, internal, medicine, according, to, aristotle, s, testimony, hippocrates, was, known, as, the, great, hippocrates, concerning, his, disposition, hippocrates, was, first, portrayed, as, a, kind, dignified, old, country, doctor, and, later, as, stern, and, forbidding, he, is, certainly, considered, wise, of, very, great, intellect, and, especially, as, very, practical, francis, adams, describes, him, as, strictly, the, physician, of, experience, and, common, sense, his, image, as, the, wise, old, doctor, is, reinforced, by, busts, of, him, which, wear, large, beards, on, a, wrinkled, face, many, physicians, of, the, time, wore, their, hair, in, the, style, of, jove, and, asklepius, accordingly, the, busts, of, hippocrates, that, have, been, found, could, be, only, altered, versions, of, portraits, of, these, deities, hippocrates, and, the, beliefs, that, he, embodied, are, considered, medical, ideals, fielding, garrison, an, authority, on, medical, history, stated, he, is, above, all, the, exemplar, of, that, flexible, critical, well, poised, attitude, of, mind, ever, on, the, lookout, for, sources, of, error, which, is, the, very, essence, of, the, scientific, spirit, his, figure, stands, for, all, time, as, that, of, the, ideal, physician, according, to, a, short, history, of, medicine, inspiring, the, medical, profession, since, his, death, the, travels, of, sir, john, mandeville, reports, incorrectly, that, hippocrates, was, the, ruler, of, the, islands, of, kos, and, lango, and, recounts, a, legend, about, hippocrates, s, daughter, she, was, transformed, into, a, hundred, foot, long, dragon, by, the, goddess, diana, and, is, the, lady, of, the, manor, of, an, old, castle, she, emerges, three, times, a, year, and, will, be, turned, back, into, a, woman, if, a, knight, kisses, her, making, the, knight, into, her, consort, and, ruler, of, the, islands, various, knights, try, but, flee, when, they, see, the, hideous, dragon, they, die, soon, thereafter, this, is, a, version, of, the, legend, of, melusine, some, clinical, symptoms, and, signs, have, been, named, after, hippocrates, as, he, is, believed, to, be, the, first, person, to, describe, them, hippocratic, face, is, the, change, produced, in, the, countenance, by, death, or, long, sickness, excessive, evacuations, excessive, hunger, and, the, like, clubbing, a, deformity, of, the, fingers, and, fingernails, is, also, known, as, hippocratic, fingers, hippocratic, succussion, is, the, internal, splashing, noise, of, hydropneumothorax, or, pyopneumothorax, hippocratic, bench, a, device, which, uses, tension, to, aid, in, setting, bones, and, hippocratic, cap, shaped, bandage, are, two, devices, named, after, hippocrates, hippocratic, corpus, and, hippocratic, oath, are, also, his, namesakes, risus, sardonicus, a, sustained, spasming, of, the, face, muscles, may, also, be, termed, the, hippocratic, smile,
