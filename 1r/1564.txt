her, life, after, her, injury, tubman, began, experiencing, strange, visions, and, vivid, dreams, which, she, ascribed, to, premonitions, from, god, these, experiences, combined, with, her, methodist, upbringing, led, her, to, become, devoutly, religious, in, 1849, tubman, escaped, to, philadelphia, only, to, return, to, maryland, to, rescue, her, family, soon, after, slowly, one, group, at, a, time, she, brought, relatives, with, her, out, of, the, state, and, eventually, guided, dozens, of, other, enslaved, people, to, freedom, tubman, or, moses, as, she, was, called, travelled, by, night,

to, the, family, home, on, property, she, had, purchased, in, 1859, in, auburn, new, york, where, she, cared, for, her, aging, parents, she, was, active, in, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, until, illness, overtook, her, and, was, admitted, to, a, home, for, elderly, african, americans, which, she, had, helped, establish, years, earlier, tubman, is, commonly, viewed, as, an, icon, of, courage, and, freedom, tubman, was, born, araminta, minty, ross, to, enslaved, parents, harriet, rit, green, and, ben, ross, rit, was, enslaved, by, mary, pattison, brodess, and, later, her, son, edward, ben,

maryland, as, with, many, enslaved, people, in, the, united, states, neither, the, exact, year, nor, place, of, tubman, s, birth, is, known, tubman, reported, the, year, of, her, birth, as, 1825, while, her, death, certificate, lists, 1815, and, her, gravestone, lists, 1820, historian, kate, larson, s, 2004, biography, of, tubman, records, the, year, as, 1822, based, on, a, midwife, payment, and, several, other, historical, documents, including, her, runaway, advertisement, based, on, larson, s, work, more, recent, biographies, have, accepted, march, 1822, as, the, most, likely, timing, of, tubman, s, birth, tubman, s, maternal, grandmother, modesty, arrived, in, the, u, s, on, a, slave, ship, from, africa, no, information, is, available, about, her, other, ancestors, as, a, child, tubman, was, told, that, she, seemed, like, an, ashanti, person, because, of, her, character, traits, though, no, evidence, has, been, found, to, confirm, or, deny, this, lineage, her, mother, rit, who, may, have, had, a, white, father, was, a, cook, for, the, brodess, family, her, father, ben, was, a, skilled, woodsman, who, managed, the, timber, work, on, thompson, s, plantation, they, married, around, 1808, and, according, to, court, records, had, nine, children, together, linah, mariah, ritty, soph, robert, minty, harriet, ben, rachel, henry, and, moses, rit, struggled, to, keep, her, family, together, as, slavery, threatened, to, tear, it, apart, edward, brodess, sold, three, of, her, daughters, linah, mariah, ritty, and, soph, separating, them, from, the, family, forever, when, a, trader, from, georgia, approached, brodess, about, buying, rit, s, youngest, son, moses, she, hid, him, for, a, month, aided, by, other, enslaved, people, and, freedmen, in, the, community, at, one, point, she, confronted, brodess, about, the, sale, finally, brodess, and, the, georgia, man, came, toward, the, slave, quarters, to, seize, the, child, where, rit, told, them, you, are, after, my, son, but, the, first, man, that, comes, into, my, house, i, will, split, his, head, open, brodess, backed, away, and, abandoned, the, sale, tubman, s, biographers, agree, that, stories, told, about, this, event, within, the, family, influenced, her, belief, in, the, possibilities, of, resistance, tubman, s, mother, was, assigned, to, the, big, house, and, had, scarce, time, for, her, own, family, consequently, as, a, child, tubman, took, care, of, a, younger, brother, and, baby, as, was, typical, in, large, families, when, she, was, five, or, six, years, old, brodess, hired, her, out, as, a, nursemaid, to, a, woman, named, miss, susan, tubman, was, ordered, to, care, for, the, baby, and, rock, the, cradle, as, it, slept, when, the, baby, woke, up, and, cried, tubman, was, whipped, she, later, recounted, a, particular, day, when, she, was, lashed, five, times, before, breakfast, she, carried, the, scars, for, the, rest, of, her, life, she, found, ways, to, resist, such, as, running, away, for, five, days, wearing, layers, of, clothing, as, protection, against, beatings, and, fighting, back, also, in, her, childhood, tubman, was, sent, to, work, for, a, planter, named, james, cook, she, had, to, check, his, muskrat, traps, in, nearby, marshes, even, after, contracting, measles, she, became, so, ill, that, cook, sent, her, back, to, brodess, where, her, mother, nursed, her, back, to, health, brodess, then, hired, her, out, again, she, spoke, later, of, her, acute, childhood, homesickness, comparing, herself, to, the, boy, on, the, swanee, river, an, allusion, to, stephen, foster, s, song, old, folks, at, home, as, she, grew, older, and, stronger, she, was, assigned, to, field, and, forest, work, driving, oxen, plowing, and, hauling, logs, as, an, adolescent, tubman, suffered, a, severe, head, injury, when, an, overseer, threw, a, two, pound, 1, kg, metal, weight, at, another, slave, who, was, attempting, to, flee, the, weight, struck, tubman, instead, which, she, said, broke, my, skull, bleeding, and, unconscious, she, was, returned, to, her, enslaver, s, house, and, laid, on, the, seat, of, a, loom, where, she, remained, without, medical, care, for, two, days, after, this, incident, tubman, frequently, experienced, extremely, painful, headaches, she, also, began, having, seizures, and, would, seemingly, fall, unconscious, although, she, claimed, to, be, aware, of, her, surroundings, while, appearing, to, be, asleep, larson, suggests, she, may, have, had, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, possibly, as, a, result, of, brain, injury, clinton, suggests, her, condition, may, have, been, narcolepsy, or, cataplexy, a, definitive, diagnosis, is, not, possible, due, to, lack, of, contemporary, medical, evidence, but, this, condition, remained, with, her, for, the, rest, of, her, life, after, her, injury, tubman, began, experiencing, visions, and, vivid, dreams, which, she, interpreted, as, revelations, from, god, these, spiritual, experiences, had, a, profound, effect, on, tubman, s, personality, and, she, acquired, a, passionate, faith, in, god, although, tubman, was, illiterate, she, was, told, bible, stories, by, her, mother, and, likely, attended, a, methodist, church, with, her, family, mystical, inspiration, guided, her, actions, she, rejected, the, teachings, of, white, preachers, who, urged, enslaved, people, to, be, passive, and, obedient, victims, to, those, who, trafficked, and, enslaved, them, instead, she, found, guidance, in, the, old, testament, tales, of, deliverance, this, religious, perspective, informed, her, actions, throughout, her, life, anthony, thompson, promised, to, manumit, tubman, s, father, at, age, 45, after, thompson, died, his, son, followed, through, with, that, promise, in, 1840, tubman, s, father, continued, working, as, a, timber, estimator, and, foreman, for, the, thompson, family, later, in, the, 1840s, tubman, paid, a, white, attorney, five, dollars, equivalent, to, 160, in, 2023, to, investigate, the, legal, status, of, her, mother, rit, the, lawyer, discovered, that, atthow, pattison, the, grandfather, of, mary, brodess, indicated, in, his, will, that, rit, and, any, of, her, children, would, be, manumitted, at, age, 45, and, that, any, children, born, after, she, reached, age, 45, would, be, freeborn, the, pattison, and, brodess, families, ignored, this, stipulation, when, they, inherited, the, enslaved, family, but, taking, legal, action, to, enforce, it, was, an, impossible, task, for, tubman, around, 1844, she, married, john, tubman, a, free, black, man, although, little, is, known, about, him, or, their, time, together, the, union, was, complicated, because, of, her, enslaved, status, the, mother, s, status, dictated, that, of, children, and, any, children, born, to, harriet, and, john, would, be, enslaved, such, blended, marriages, free, people, of, color, marrying, enslaved, people, were, not, uncommon, on, the, eastern, shore, of, maryland, where, by, this, time, half, the, black, population, was, free, most, african, american, families, had, both, free, and, enslaved, members, larson, suggests, that, they, might, have, planned, to, buy, tubman, s, freedom, tubman, changed, her, name, from, araminta, to, harriet, soon, after, her, marriage, though, the, exact, timing, is, unclear, larson, suggests, this, happened, right, after, the, wedding, and, clinton, suggests, that, it, coincided, with, tubman, s, plans, to, escape, from, slavery, she, adopted, her, mother, s, name, possibly, as, part, of, a, religious, conversion, or, to, honor, another, relative, in, 1849, tubman, became, ill, again, which, diminished, her, value, to, slave, traders, edward, brodess, tried, to, sell, her, but, could, not, find, a, buyer, angry, at, him, for, trying, to, sell, her, and, for, continuing, to, enslave, her, relatives, tubman, began, to, pray, for, god, to, make, brodess, change, his, ways, she, said, later, i, prayed, all, night, long, for, my, master, till, the, first, of, march, and, all, the, time, he, was, bringing, people, to, look, at, me, and, trying, to, sell, me, when, it, appeared, as, though, a, sale, was, being, concluded, tubman, changed, her, prayer, first, of, march, i, began, to, pray, oh, lord, if, you, ain, t, never, going, to, change, that, man, s, heart, kill, him, lord, and, take, him, out, of, the, way, a, week, later, brodess, died, and, tubman, expressed, regret, for, her, earlier, sentiments, as, in, many, estate, settlements, brodess, s, death, increased, the, likelihood, that, tubman, would, be, sold, and, her, family, broken, apart, his, widow, eliza, began, working, to, sell, the, family, s, enslaved, people, tubman, refused, to, wait, for, the, brodess, family, to, decide, her, fate, despite, her, husband, s, efforts, to, dissuade, her, she, later, said, that, there, was, one, of, two, things, i, had, a, right, to, liberty, or, death, if, i, could, not, have, one, i, would, have, the, other, tubman, and, her, brothers, ben, and, henry, escaped, from, slavery, on, september, 17, 1849, tubman, had, been, hired, out, to, anthony, thompson, the, son, of, her, father, s, former, owner, who, owned, a, large, plantation, in, an, area, called, poplar, neck, in, neighboring, caroline, county, it, is, likely, her, brothers, labored, for, thompson, as, well, because, they, were, hired, out, eliza, brodess, probably, did, not, recognize, their, absence, as, an, escape, attempt, for, some, time, two, weeks, later, she, posted, a, runaway, notice, in, the, cambridge, democrat, offering, a, reward, of, up, to, us, 100, each, equivalent, to, 3, 660, in, 2023, for, their, capture, and, return, to, slavery, once, they, had, left, tubman, s, brothers, had, second, thoughts, ben, may, have, regretted, leaving, his, wife, and, children, the, two, men, went, back, forcing, tubman, to, return, with, them, sometime, in, october, or, november, tubman, escaped, again, this, time, without, her, brothers, before, leaving, she, sang, a, farewell, song, to, hint, at, her, intentions, which, she, hoped, would, be, understood, by, mary, a, trusted, fellow, slave, i, ll, meet, you, in, the, morning, she, intoned, i, m, bound, for, the, promised, land, while, her, exact, route, is, unknown, tubman, made, use, of, the, network, known, as, the, underground, railroad, this, informal, system, was, composed, of, free, and, enslaved, black, people, white, abolitionists, and, other, activists, most, prominent, among, the, latter, in, maryland, at, the, time, were, quakers, members, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, the, preston, area, near, poplar, neck, contained, a, substantial, quaker, community, and, was, probably, an, important, first, stop, during, tubman, s, escape, from, there, she, probably, took, a, common, route, for, people, fleeing, slavery, northeast, along, the, choptank, river, through, delaware, and, then, north, into, pennsylvania, a, journey, of, nearly, 90, miles, 145, km, by, foot, would, have, taken, between, five, days, and, three, weeks, tubman, had, to, travel, by, night, guided, by, the, north, star, and, trying, to, avoid, slave, catchers, eager, to, collect, rewards, for, fugitive, slaves, the, conductors, in, the, underground, railroad, used, deceptions, for, protection, at, an, early, stop, the, lady, of, the, house, instructed, tubman, to, sweep, the, yard, so, as, to, seem, to, be, working, for, the, family, when, night, fell, the, family, hid, her, in, a, cart, and, took, her, to, the, next, friendly, house, given, her, familiarity, with, the, woods, and, marshes, of, the, region, tubman, likely, hid, in, these, locales, during, the, day, the, particulars, of, her, first, journey, are, unknown, because, other, escapees, from, slavery, used, the, routes, tubman, did, not, discuss, them, until, later, in, life, she, crossed, into, pennsylvania, with, a, feeling, of, relief, and, awe, and, recalled, the, experience, years, later, when, i, found, i, had, crossed, that, line, i, looked, at, my, hands, to, see, if, i, was, the, same, person, there, was, such, a, glory, over, everything, the, sun, came, like, gold, through, the, trees, and, over, the, fields, and, i, felt, like, i, was, in, heaven, after, reaching, philadelphia, tubman, thought, of, her, family, i, was, a, stranger, in, a, strange, land, she, said, later, y, father, my, mother, my, brothers, and, sisters, and, friends, were, but, i, was, free, and, they, should, be, free, while, tubman, saved, money, from, working, odd, jobs, in, philadelphia, and, cape, may, new, jersey, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, fugitive, slave, act, of, 1850, which, forced, law, enforcement, officials, to, assist, in, the, capture, of, escaped, slaves, even, in, states, that, had, outlawed, slavery, and, heavily, punished, abetting, escape, the, law, increased, risks, for, those, who, had, escaped, slavery, more, of, whom, therefore, sought, refuge, in, southern, ontario, where, slavery, had, been, abolished, racial, tensions, were, also, increasing, in, philadelphia, as, poor, irish, immigrants, competed, with, free, blacks, for, work, in, december, 1850, tubman, was, warned, that, her, niece, kessiah, and, kessiah, s, children, would, soon, be, sold, in, cambridge, maryland, tubman, went, to, baltimore, where, her, brother, in, law, tom, tubman, hid, her, until, the, sale, kessiah, s, husband, a, free, black, man, named, john, bowley, made, the, winning, bid, for, his, wife, while, the, auctioneer, stepped, away, to, have, lunch, john, kessiah, and, their, children, escaped, to, a, nearby, safe, house, when, night, fell, bowley, sailed, the, family, on, a, log, canoe, 60, miles, 97, km, to, baltimore, where, they, met, with, tubman, who, brought, the, family, to, philadelphia, early, next, year, she, returned, to, maryland, to, guide, away, other, family, members, during, her, second, trip, she, recovered, her, youngest, brother, moses, along, with, two, other, men, word, of, her, exploits, had, encouraged, her, family, and, she, became, more, confident, with, each, trip, to, maryland, in, late, 1851, tubman, returned, to, dorchester, county, for, the, first, time, since, her, escape, this, time, to, find, her, husband, john, when, she, arrived, there, she, learned, that, john, had, married, another, woman, named, caroline, tubman, sent, word, that, he, should, join, her, but, he, insisted, that, he, was, happy, where, he, was, suppressing, her, anger, she, found, some, enslaved, people, who, wanted, to, escape, and, led, them, to, philadelphia, because, the, fugitive, slave, law, had, made, the, northern, united, states, a, more, dangerous, place, for, those, escaping, slavery, to, remain, many, escapees, began, migrating, to, southern, ontario, in, december, 1851, tubman, guided, an, unidentified, group, of, 11, escapees, possibly, including, the, bowleys, and, several, others, she, had, helped, rescue, earlier, northward, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, tubman, and, her, group, stopped, at, the, home, of, abolitionist, and, former, slave, frederick, douglass, douglass, and, tubman, admired, one, another, greatly, as, they, both, struggled, against, slavery, years, later, he, contrasted, his, efforts, with, hers, writing, most, that, i, have, done, and, suffered, in, the, service, of, our, cause, has, been, in, public, and, i, have, received, much, encouragement, at, every, step, of, the, way, you, on, the, other, hand, have, labored, in, a, private, way, i, have, wrought, in, the, day, you, in, the, night, the, midnight, sky, and, the, silent, stars, have, been, the, witnesses, of, your, devotion, to, freedom, and, of, your, heroism, excepting, john, brown, of, sacred, memory, i, know, of, no, one, who, has, willingly, encountered, more, perils, and, hardships, to, serve, our, enslaved, people, than, you, have, from, 1851, to, 1862, tubman, returned, repeatedly, to, the, eastern, shore, of, maryland, rescuing, some, 70, slaves, in, about, 13, expeditions, including, her, other, brothers, henry, ben, and, robert, their, wives, and, some, of, their, children, she, also, provided, specific, instructions, to, 50, to, 60, additional, enslaved, people, who, escaped, because, of, her, efforts, she, was, nicknamed, moses, alluding, to, the, biblical, prophet, who, led, the, hebrews, to, freedom, from, egypt, one, of, her, last, missions, into, maryland, was, to, retrieve, her, aging, parents, her, father, purchased, her, mother, from, eliza, brodess, in, 1855, but, even, when, they, were, both, free, the, area, was, hostile, in, 1857, tubman, received, word, that, her, father, was, at, risk, of, arrest, for, harboring, a, group, of, eight, people, escaping, slavery, she, led, her, parents, north, to, st, catharines, canada, where, a, community, of, formerly, enslaved, people, including, other, relatives, and, friends, of, tubman, had, gathered, tubman, s, dangerous, work, required, ingenuity, she, usually, worked, during, winter, when, long, nights, and, cold, weather, minimized, the, chance, of, being, seen, she, would, start, the, escapes, on, saturday, evenings, since, newspapers, would, not, print, runaway, notices, until, monday, morning, she, used, subterfuges, to, avoid, detection, tubman, once, disguised, herself, with, a, bonnet, and, carried, two, live, chickens, to, give, the, appearance, of, running, errands, suddenly, finding, herself, walking, toward, a, former, enslaver, she, yanked, the, strings, holding, the, birds, legs, and, their, agitation, allowed, her, to, avoid, eye, contact, later, she, recognized, a, fellow, train, passenger, as, a, former, enslaver, she, snatched, a, nearby, newspaper, and, pretended, to, read, tubman, was, known, to, be, illiterate, and, the, man, ignored, her, in, an, 1897, interview, with, historian, wilbur, siebert, tubman, named, some, people, who, helped, her, and, places, she, stayed, along, the, underground, railroad, she, stayed, with, sam, green, a, free, black, minister, living, in, east, new, market, maryland, she, also, hid, near, her, parents, home, at, poplar, neck, she, would, travel, from, there, northeast, to, sandtown, and, willow, grove, delaware, and, to, the, camden, area, where, free, black, agents, william, and, nat, brinkley, and, abraham, gibbs, guided, her, north, past, dover, smyrna, and, blackbird, where, other, agents, would, take, her, across, the, chesapeake, and, delaware, canal, to, new, castle, and, wilmington, in, wilmington, quaker, thomas, garrett, would, secure, transportation, to, william, still, s, office, or, the, homes, of, other, underground, railroad, operators, in, the, greater, philadelphia, area, still, is, credited, with, helping, hundreds, escape, to, safer, places, in, new, york, new, england, and, southern, ontario, tubman, s, faith, was, another, important, resource, as, she, ventured, repeatedly, into, maryland, the, visions, from, her, childhood, head, injury, continued, and, she, saw, them, as, divine, premonitions, she, spoke, of, consulting, with, god, and, trusted, that, he, would, keep, her, safe, garrett, once, said, of, her, i, never, met, with, any, person, of, any, color, who, had, more, confidence, in, the, voice, of, god, as, spoken, direct, to, her, soul, her, faith, also, provided, immediate, assistance, she, used, spirituals, as, coded, messages, warning, fellow, travelers, of, danger, or, to, signal, a, clear, path, she, sang, versions, of, go, down, moses, and, changed, the, lyrics, to, indicate, that, it, was, either, safe, or, too, dangerous, to, proceed, as, she, led, escapees, across, the, border, she, would, call, out, glory, to, god, and, jesus, too, one, more, soul, is, safe, she, carried, a, revolver, as, protection, from, slave, catchers, and, their, dogs, tubman, also, threatened, to, shoot, anyone, who, tried, to, turn, back, since, that, would, risk, the, safety, of, the, remaining, group, as, well, as, anyone, who, helped, them, on, the, way, tubman, spoke, of, one, man, who, insisted, he, was, going, to, go, back, to, the, plantation, she, pointed, the, gun, at, his, head, and, said, go, on, or, die, several, days, later, the, man, who, wavered, crossed, into, canada, with, the, rest, of, the, group, by, the, late, 1850s, eastern, shore, slaveholders, were, holding, public, meetings, about, the, large, number, of, escapes, in, the, area, they, cast, suspicion, on, free, blacks, and, white, abolitionists, they, did, not, know, that, minty, the, petite, disabled, woman, who, had, run, away, years, before, was, responsible, for, freeing, so, many, enslaved, people, though, a, popular, legend, persists, about, a, reward, of, 40, 000, equivalent, to, 1, 356, 000, in, 2023, for, tubman, s, capture, this, is, a, manufactured, figure, in, 1867, in, support, of, tubman, s, claim, for, a, military, pension, an, abolitionist, named, sallie, holley, wrote, that, 40, 000, was, not, too, great, a, reward, for, maryland, slaveholders, to, offer, for, her, if, it, were, real, such, a, high, reward, would, have, garnered, national, attention, a, reward, of, 12, 000, has, also, been, claimed, though, no, documentation, has, been, found, for, either, figure, tubman, and, the, fugitives, she, assisted, were, never, captured, years, later, she, told, an, audience, i, was, conductor, of, the, underground, railroad, for, eight, years, and, i, can, say, what, most, conductors, can, t, say, i, never, ran, my, train, off, the, track, and, i, never, lost, a, passenger, in, april, 1858, tubman, was, introduced, to, the, abolitionist, john, brown, an, insurgent, who, advocated, the, use, of, violence, to, destroy, slavery, in, the, united, states, although, she, was, not, previously, involved, in, armed, insurrection, she, agreed, with, his, course, of, direct, action, and, supported, his, goals, like, tubman, he, spoke, of, being, called, by, god, and, trusted, the, divine, to, protect, him, from, the, wrath, of, slavers, she, meanwhile, claimed, to, have, had, a, prophetic, vision, of, meeting, brown, before, their, encounter, thus, as, he, began, recruiting, supporters, for, an, attack, on, slaveholders, brown, was, joined, by, general, tubman, as, he, called, her, her, knowledge, of, support, networks, and, resources, in, the, border, states, of, pennsylvania, maryland, and, delaware, was, invaluable, to, brown, and, his, planners, although, other, abolitionists, like, douglass, did, not, endorse, his, tactics, brown, dreamed, of, fighting, to, create, a, new, state, for, those, freed, from, slavery, and, made, preparations, for, military, action, he, believed, that, after, he, began, the, first, battle, the, enslaved, would, rise, up, and, carry, out, a, rebellion, across, the, slave, states, he, asked, tubman, to, gather, former, slaves, then, living, in, southern, ontario, who, might, be, willing, to, join, his, fighting, force, which, she, did, on, may, 8, 1858, brown, held, a, meeting, in, chatham, canada, where, he, unveiled, his, plan, for, a, raid, on, harpers, ferry, virginia, when, word, of, the, plan, was, leaked, to, the, government, brown, put, the, scheme, on, hold, and, began, raising, funds, for, its, eventual, resumption, tubman, aided, him, in, this, effort, and, with, more, detailed, plans, for, the, assault, tubman, was, busy, during, this, time, giving, talks, to, abolitionist, audiences, and, tending, to, her, relatives, in, early, october, 1859, as, brown, and, his, men, prepared, to, launch, the, attack, tubman, was, ill, in, new, bedford, massachusetts, it, is, not, known, whether, she, still, intended, to, join, brown, s, raid, or, if, she, had, become, skeptical, of, the, plan, but, when, the, raid, on, harpers, ferry, took, place, on, october, 16, tubman, had, recovered, from, her, illness, and, was, in, new, york, city, the, raid, failed, brown, was, convicted, of, treason, murder, and, inciting, a, rebellion, and, he, was, hanged, on, december, 2, his, actions, were, seen, by, many, abolitionists, as, a, symbol, of, proud, resistance, carried, out, by, a, noble, martyr, tubman, herself, was, effusive, with, praise, she, later, told, a, friend, e, done, more, in, dying, than, 100, men, would, in, living, in, early, 1859, frances, adeline, seward, the, wife, of, abolitionist, republican, u, s, senator, william, h, seward, sold, tubman, a, seven, acre, 2, 8, ha, farm, in, fleming, new, york, for, 1, 200, equivalent, to, 43, 900, in, 2023, the, adjacent, city, of, auburn, was, a, hotbed, of, antislavery, activism, and, tubman, took, the, opportunity, to, move, her, parents, from, canada, back, to, the, u, s, her, farmstead, became, a, haven, for, tubman, s, family, and, friends, for, years, she, took, in, relatives, and, boarders, offering, a, safe, place, for, black, americans, seeking, a, better, life, in, the, north, shortly, after, acquiring, the, farm, tubman, went, back, to, maryland, and, returned, with, an, eight, year, old, light, skinned, black, girl, named, margaret, who, tubman, said, was, her, niece, she, also, indicated, the, girl, s, parents, were, free, blacks, according, to, margaret, s, daughter, alice, margaret, later, described, her, childhood, home, as, prosperous, and, said, that, she, left, behind, a, twin, brother, these, descriptions, conflict, with, what, is, known, about, the, families, of, tubman, s, siblings, which, created, uncertainty, among, historians, about, the, relationship, and, tubman, s, motivations, alice, called, tubman, s, actions, a, kidnapping, saying, she, had, taken, the, child, from, a, sheltered, good, home, to, a, place, where, there, was, nobody, to, care, for, her, after, speculating, in, her, 2004, biography, of, tubman, that, margaret, might, have, been, tubman, s, own, secret, daughter, kate, larson, found, evidence, that, margaret, was, the, daughter, of, isaac, and, mary, woolford, a, free, black, couple, who, were, neighbors, of, tubman, s, parents, in, maryland, and, who, had, twins, named, james, and, margaret, in, november, 1860, tubman, conducted, her, last, rescue, mission, throughout, the, 1850s, tubman, had, been, unable, to, effect, the, escape, of, her, sister, rachel, and, rachel, s, two, children, ben, and, angerine, upon, returning, to, dorchester, county, tubman, discovered, that, rachel, had, died, and, the, children, could, be, rescued, only, if, she, could, pay, a, bribe, of, 30, equivalent, to, 1, 020, in, 2023, she, did, not, have, the, money, so, the, children, remained, enslaved, their, fates, remain, unknown, never, one, to, waste, a, trip, tubman, gathered, another, group, including, the, ennalls, family, ready, and, willing, to, take, the, risks, of, the, journey, north, it, took, them, weeks, to, get, away, safely, because, of, slave, catchers, forcing, them, to, hide, out, longer, than, expected, the, weather, was, unseasonably, cold, and, they, had, little, food, the, ennalls, infant, child, was, quieted, with, paregoric, while, slave, patrols, rode, by, they, safely, reached, the, home, of, david, and, martha, wright, in, auburn, on, december, 28, 1860, when, the, civil, war, broke, out, in, 1861, tubman, had, a, vision, that, the, war, would, soon, lead, to, the, abolition, of, slavery, more, immediately, enslaved, people, near, union, positions, began, escaping, in, large, numbers, general, benjamin, butler, declared, these, escapees, to, be, contraband, property, seized, by, northern, forces, and, put, them, to, work, initially, without, pay, at, fort, monroe, in, virginia, the, number, of, contrabands, encamped, at, fort, monroe, and, other, union, positions, rapidly, increased, in, january, 1862, tubman, volunteered, to, support, the, union, cause, and, began, helping, refugees, in, the, camps, particularly, in, port, royal, south, carolina, in, south, carolina, tubman, met, general, david, hunter, a, strong, supporter, of, abolition, he, declared, all, of, the, contrabands, in, the, port, royal, district, free, and, began, gathering, formerly, enslaved, people, for, a, regiment, of, black, soldiers, u, s, president, abraham, lincoln, was, not, yet, prepared, to, enforce, emancipation, on, the, southern, states, and, reprimanded, hunter, for, his, actions, tubman, condemned, lincoln, s, response, and, his, general, unwillingness, to, consider, ending, slavery, in, the, u, s, for, both, moral, and, practical, reasons, god, won, t, let, master, lincoln, beat, the, south, till, he, does, the, right, thing, master, lincoln, he, s, a, great, man, and, i, am, a, poor, negro, but, the, negro, can, tell, master, lincoln, how, to, save, the, money, and, the, young, men, he, can, do, it, by, setting, the, negro, free, tubman, served, as, a, nurse, in, port, royal, preparing, remedies, from, local, plants, and, aiding, soldiers, suffering, from, dysentery, and, infectious, diseases, at, first, she, received, government, rations, for, her, work, but, to, dispel, a, perception, that, she, was, getting, special, treatment, she, gave, up, her, right, to, these, supplies, and, made, money, selling, pies, and, root, beer, which, she, made, in, the, evenings, when, lincoln, issued, the, emancipation, proclamation, tubman, considered, it, a, positive, but, incomplete, step, toward, the, goal, of, liberating, all, black, people, from, slavery, she, turned, her, own, efforts, towards, more, direct, actions, to, defeat, the, confederacy, in, early, 1863, tubman, used, her, knowledge, of, covert, travel, and, subterfuge, to, lead, a, band, of, scouts, through, the, land, around, port, royal, her, group, working, under, the, orders, of, secretary, of, war, edwin, stanton, mapped, the, unfamiliar, terrain, and, reconnoitered, its, inhabitants, she, later, worked, alongside, colonel, james, montgomery, and, provided, him, with, key, intelligence, that, aided, in, the, capture, of, jacksonville, florida, later, that, year, tubman, s, intelligence, gathering, played, a, key, role, in, the, raid, at, combahee, ferry, she, guided, three, steamboats, with, black, soldiers, under, montgomery, s, command, past, mines, on, the, combahee, river, to, assault, several, plantations, once, ashore, the, union, troops, set, fire, to, the, plantations, destroying, infrastructure, and, seizing, thousands, of, dollars, worth, of, food, and, supplies, forewarned, of, the, raid, by, tubman, s, spy, network, enslaved, people, throughout, the, area, heard, steamboats, whistles, and, understood, that, they, were, being, liberated, tubman, watched, as, those, fleeing, slavery, stampeded, toward, the, boats, she, later, described, a, scene, of, chaos, with, women, carrying, still, steaming, pots, of, rice, pigs, squealing, in, bags, slung, over, shoulders, and, babies, hanging, around, their, parents, necks, armed, overseers, tried, to, stop, the, mass, escape, but, their, efforts, were, nearly, useless, in, the, tumult, as, confederate, troops, raced, to, the, scene, the, steamboats, took, off, toward, beaufort, with, more, than, 750, formerly, enslaved, people, newspapers, heralded, tubman, s, patriotism, sagacity, energy, ability, in, the, raid, and, she, was, praised, for, her, recruiting, efforts, more, than, 100, of, the, newly, liberated, men, joined, the, union, army, reports, about, her, involvement, in, the, raid, led, to, a, revival, of, the, general, tubman, appellation, previously, given, to, her, by, john, brown, although, her, contributions, have, sometimes, been, exaggerated, her, role, in, the, raid, led, to, her, being, widely, credited, as, the, first, woman, to, lead, u, s, troops, in, an, armed, assault, in, july, 1863, tubman, worked, with, colonel, robert, gould, shaw, at, the, assault, on, fort, wagner, reportedly, serving, him, his, last, meal, she, later, described, the, battle, to, historian, albert, bushnell, hart, and, then, we, saw, the, lightning, and, that, was, the, guns, and, then, we, heard, the, thunder, and, that, was, the, big, guns, and, then, we, heard, the, rain, falling, and, that, was, the, drops, of, blood, falling, and, when, we, came, to, get, the, crops, it, was, dead, men, that, we, reaped, for, two, more, years, tubman, worked, for, the, union, forces, tending, to, newly, liberated, people, scouting, into, confederate, territory, and, nursing, wounded, soldiers, in, virginia, a, task, she, continued, for, several, months, after, the, confederacy, surrendered, in, april, 1865, tubman, had, received, little, pay, for, her, union, military, service, she, was, not, a, regular, soldier, and, was, only, occasionally, compensated, for, her, work, as, a, spy, and, scout, her, work, as, a, nurse, was, entirely, unpaid, for, over, three, years, of, service, she, received, a, total, of, 200, equivalent, to, 3, 980, in, 2023, her, unofficial, status, caused, great, difficulty, in, documenting, her, service, and, the, u, s, government, was, slow, to, recognize, any, debt, to, her, meanwhile, her, humanitarian, work, for, her, family, and, the, formerly, enslaved, kept, her, in, a, state, of, constant, poverty, when, a, promised, appointment, to, an, official, military, nursing, position, fell, through, in, july, 1865, tubman, decided, to, return, to, her, home, in, new, york, during, a, train, ride, to, new, york, in, october, 1865, tubman, traveled, on, a, half, fare, ticket, provided, to, her, because, of, her, service, a, conductor, told, her, to, move, from, a, regular, passenger, car, into, the, less, desirable, smoking, car, when, she, refused, he, cursed, at, her, and, grabbed, her, she, resisted, and, he, summoned, additional, men, for, help, they, muscled, her, into, the, smoking, car, injuring, her, in, the, process, as, these, events, transpired, white, passengers, cursed, tubman, and, told, the, conductor, to, kick, her, off, the, train, tubman, spent, her, remaining, years, in, auburn, tending, to, her, family, and, other, people, in, need, in, addition, to, managing, her, farm, she, took, in, boarders, and, worked, various, jobs, to, pay, the, bills, and, support, her, elderly, parents, one, of, the, people, tubman, took, in, was, a, farmer, named, nelson, davis, born, enslaved, in, north, carolina, he, had, served, as, a, private, in, the, 8th, united, states, colored, infantry, regiment, from, september, 1863, to, november, 1865, he, began, working, in, auburn, as, a, bricklayer, and,

biography, entitled, scenes, in, the, life, of, harriet, tubman, the, 132, page, volume, was, published, in, 1869, and, brought, tubman, some, 1, 200, in, income, equivalent, to, 27, 500, in, 2023, even, with, this, assistance, paying, off, the, mortgage, on, her, farm, in, may, 1873, exhausted, tubman, s, savings, that, october, she, fell, prey, to, swindlers, two, black, men, claimed, to, know, a, former, slave, who, had, a, trunk, of, gold, coins, smuggled, out, of, south, carolina, which, they, would, sell, for, cash, at, less, than, half, the, coins, value, she, knew, white, people, in, the, south, had, buried, valuables, when, union, forces, threatened, the, region, and, black, men, were, frequently, assigned, to, digging, duties, so, the, claim, seemed, plausible, to, her, she, borrowed, money, from, a, wealthy, friend, and, arranged, to, receive, the, gold, late, one, night, once, the, men, had, lured, her, into, the, woods, they, knocked, her, out, with, chloroform, and, stole, her, purse, tubman, was, found, dazed, and, injured, the, trunk, was, filled, with, rocks, the, crime, brought, new, attention, from, local, leaders, to, tubman, s, precarious, financial, state, and, spurred, renewed, efforts, to, get, compensation, for, her, civil, war, service, in, 1874, representatives, clinton, d, macdougall, of, new, york, and, gerry, w, hazelton, of, wisconsin, introduced, a, bill, to, pay, tubman, a, 2, 000, equivalent, to, 53, 900, in, 2023, lump, sum, for, services, rendered, by, her, to, the, union, army, as, scout, nurse, and, spy, but, it, was, defeated, in, the, senate, in, february, 1880, tubman, s, wood, framed, house, burned, down, but, with, the, help, of, her, supporters, it, was, quickly, replaced, with, a, new, brick, home, nelson,

monthly, pension, of, 25, equivalent, to, 920, in, 2023, although, congress, received, documents, and, letters, to, support, tubman, s, claims, some, members, objected, to, a, woman, being, paid, a, full, soldier, s, pension, in, february, 1899, congress, approved, a, compromise, amount, of, 20, equivalent, to, 730, in, 2023, per, month, the, 8, from, her, widow, s, pension, plus, 12, for, her, service, as, a, nurse, but, did, not, acknowledge, her, as, a, scout, and, spy, in, her, later, years, tubman, worked, to, promote, the, cause, of, women, s, suffrage, a, white, woman, once, asked, tubman, whether, she, believed, women, ought, to, have, the, vote, and, received, the, reply, i, suffered, enough, to, believe, it, tubman, began, attending, meetings, of, suffragist, organizations, and, was, soon, working, alongside, women, such, as, susan, b, anthony, and, emily, howland, tubman, traveled, to, new, york, boston, and, washington, d, c, to, speak, in, favor, of, women, s, voting, rights, she, described, her, actions, during, and, after, the, civil, war, and, used, the, sacrifices, of, countless, women, throughout, modern, history, as, evidence, of, women, s, equality, to, men, when, the, national, federation, of, afro, american, women, was, founded, in, 1896, tubman, was, the, keynote, speaker, at, its, first, meeting, this, wave, of, activism, kindled, a, new, wave, of, admiration, for, tubman, among, the, press, in, the, united, states, a, publication, called, the, woman, s, era, launched, a, series, of, articles, on, eminent, women, with, a, profile, of, tubman, an, 1897, suffragist, newspaper, reported, a, series, of, receptions, in, boston, honoring, tubman, and, her, lifetime, of, service, to, the, nation, however, her, endless, contributions, to, others,

for, indigent, colored, people, despite, her, financial, limitations, in, 1896, tubman, bid, 1215, equivalent, to, 44, 500, in, 2023, at, auction, for, a, 25, acre, 10, ha, farm, adjacent, to, the, one, she, already, owned, to, use, for, the, new, facility, she, designated, one, of, the, farm, s, buildings, as, its, primary, residence, and, named, it, john, brown, hall, to, honor, her, late, abolitionist, ally, however, raising, funds, for, the, project, was, difficult, and, attempts, to, donate, the, property, were, complicated, by, the, multiple, mortgage, loans, used, to, pay, for, it, after, tubman, almost, lost, the, property, because, of, her, financial, difficulties, ame, zion, agreed, to, take, it, over, in, 1903, the, home, did, not, open, for, another, five, years, and, tubman, was, dismayed, when, the, church, ordered, residents, to, pay, a, 100, entrance, fee, equivalent, to, 3, 390, in, 2023, she, said, hey, make, a, rule, that, nobody, should, come, in, without, they, have, a, hundred, dollars, now, i, wanted, to, make, a, rule, that, nobody, should, come, in, unless, they, didn, t, have, no, money, at, all, she, was, frustrated, by, the, new, rule, but, was, the, guest, of, honor, nonetheless, when, the, home, celebrated, its, opening, on, june, 23, 1908, as, tubman, aged, her, childhood, head, trauma, continued, to, trouble, her, unable, to, sleep,

and, raised, it, up, and, now, it, feels, more, comfortable, she, reportedly, received, no, anesthesia, and, instead, bit, down, on, a, bullet, as, she, had, seen, civil, war, soldiers, do, when, their, limbs, were, amputated, by, 1911, tubman, s, body, was, so, frail, that, she, was, admitted, into, the, rest, home, named, in, her, honor, a, new, york, newspaper, described, her, as, ill, and, penniless, prompting, supporters, to, offer, a, new, round, of, donations, surrounded, by, friends, and, family, members, she, died, of, pneumonia, on, march, 10, 1913, just, before, she, died, she,
