phil, hill, 1961, enzo, ferrari, s, strong, personality, and, controversial, management, style, became, notorious, in, 1962, following, a, rather, weak, title, defence, of, phil, hill, s, 1961, world,

volpi, ats, managed, to, lure, away, phil, hill, and, giancarlo, baghetti, from, ferrari, who, responded, by, promoting, junior, engineers, like, mauro, forghieri, sergio, scaglietti, and, giampaolo, dallara, and, hiring, ludovico, scarfiotti, lorenzo, bandini, willy, mairesse, and, john, surtees, to, drive, his, formula, one, cars, the, great, walkout, came, at, an, especially, difficult, time, for, ferrari, at, the, urging, of, chiti, the, company, was, developing, a, new, 250, based, model, even, if, the, car, would, be, finished, it, was, unclear, if, it, could, be, raced, successfully,

following, a, troubled, formula, one, 1963, campaign, with, both, cars, retiring, four, times, in, five, races, folded, at, the, end, of, the, year, in, 1998, tavoni, declared, in, an, interview, that, he, and, the, remainder, of, ferrari, s, senior, figures, did, not, leave, on, their, initiative, but, were, ousted, following, a, disagreement, with, ferrari, over, the, role, of, his, wife, in, the, company, he, said, our, mistake, was, to, go, to, a, lawyer, and, write, him, a, letter, instead, of, openly, discussing, the, issue, with, him, we, knew, that, his, wife, wasn, t, well, we, should, have, been, able, to, deal, with, it, in, a, different, way, when, he, called, the, meeting, to, fire, us, he, had, already, nominated, our, successors, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, increasing, financial, difficulties, and, the, problem, of, racing, in, many, categories, and, having, to, meet, new, safety, and, clean, air, emissions, requirement, for, road, car, production, and, development, caused, ferrari, to, start, looking, for, a, business, partner, in, 1969, ferrari, sold, 50, of, his, company, to, fiat, s, p, a, with, the, caveat, that, he, would, remain, 100, in, control, of, the, racing, activities, and, that, fiat, would, pay, a, sizable, subsidy, until, his, death, for, use, by, his, maranello, and, modena, production, plants, ferrari, had, previously, offered, ford, the, opportunity, to, buy, the, firm, in, 1963, for, us, 18, million, 179, 139, 130, in, 2023, dollars, but, late, in, negotiations, ferrari, withdrew, once, he, realized, that, ford, would, not, agree, to, grant, him, independent, control, of, the, company, racing, department, ferrari, became, a, joint, stock, company, and, fiat, took, a, small, share, in, 1965, in, 1969, fiat, increased, their, holding, to, 50, of, the, company, in, 1988, fiat, s, holding, rose, to, 90, following, the, agreement, with, fiat, ferrari, stepped, down, as, managing, director, of, the, road, car, division, in, 1971, in, 1974, ferrari, appointed, luca, cordero, di, montezemolo, as, sporting, director, formula, one, team, manager, montezemolo, eventually, assumed, the, presidency, of, ferrari, in, 1992, a, post, he, held, until, september, 2014, clay, regazzoni, was, runner, up, in, 1974, while, niki, lauda, won, the, championship, in, 1975, and, 1977, in, 1977, ferrari, was, criticized, in, the, press, for, replacing, world, champion, lauda, with, newcomer, gilles, villeneuve, ferrari, claimed, that, villeneuve, s, aggressive, driving, style, reminded, him, of, tazio, nuvolari, these, feelings, were, reinforced, after, the, 1979, french, grand, prix, when, villeneuve, finished, second, after, an, intense, battle, with, ren, arnoux, according, to, technical, director, mauro, forghieri, when, we, returned, to, maranello, ferrari, was, ecstatic, i, have, never, seen, him, so, happy, for, a, second, place, in, the, early, 1970s, ferrari, aided, by, fellow, modena, constructors, maserati, and, automobili, stanguellini, demanded, that, the, modena, town, council, and, automobile, club, d, italia, upgrade, the, modena, autodrome, the, reasoning, being, that, the, race, track, was, obsolete, and, inadequate, to, test, modern, racing, cars, the, proposal, was, initially, discussed, with, interest, but, eventually, stalled, due, to, lack, of, political, will, ferrari, then, proceeded, to, buy, the, land, adjacent, to, his, factory, and, build, the, fiorano, circuit, a, 3, km, track, still, in, use, to, test, ferrari, racing, and, road, cars, after, jody, scheckter, won, the, title, in, 1979, the, team, experienced, a, disastrous, 1980, campaign, in, 1981, ferrari, attempted, to, revive, his, team, s, fortunes, by, switching, to, turbo, engines, in, 1982, the, second, turbo, powered, ferrari, the, 126c2, showed, great, promise, however, driver, gilles, villeneuve, was, killed, in, an, accident, during, the, last, session, of, free, practice, for, the, belgian, grand, prix, in, zolder, in, may, in, august, at, hockenheim, teammate, didier, pironi, had, his, career, cut, short, in, a, violent, end, over, end, flip, on, the, misty, back, straight, after, hitting, the, renault, f1, driven, by, alain, prost, pironi, was, leading, the, driver, s, championship, at, the, time, he, would, lose, the, lead, and, the, championship, by, five, points, as, he, sat, out, the, remaining, five, races, the, scuderia, went, on, to, win, the, constructors, championship, at, the, end, of, the, season, and, in, 1983, with, driver, ren, arnoux, in, contention, for, the, championship, until, the, very, last, race, michele, alboreto, finished, second, in, 1985, but, the, team, would, not, see, championship, glory, again, before, ferrari, s, death, in, 1988, the, final, race, win, ferrari, saw, before, his, death, was, when, gerhard, berger, and, alboreto, scored, a, 1, 2, finish, at, the, final, round, of, the, 1987, season, in, australia, ferrari, s, management, style, was, autocratic, and, he, was, known, to, pit, drivers, against, each, other, in, the, hope, of, improving, their, performance, some, critics, believe, that, ferrari, deliberately, increased, psychological, pressure, on, his, drivers, encouraging, intra, team, rivalries, and, fostering, an, atmosphere, of, intense, competition, for, the, position, of, number, one, driver, he, thought, that, psychological, pressure, would, produce, better, results, for, the, drivers, said, ferrari, team, driver, tony, brooks, he, would, expect, a, driver, to, go, beyond, reasonable, limits, you, can, drive, to, the, maximum, of, your, ability, but, once, you, start, psyching, yourself, up, to, do, things, that, you, don, t, feel, are, within, your, ability, it, gets, stupid, there, was, enough, danger, at, that, time, without, going, over, the, limit, according, to, mario, andretti, just, demanded, results, but, he, was, a, guy, that, also, understood, when, the, cars, had, shortcomings, he, was, one, that, could, always, appreciate, the, effort, that, a, driver, made, when, you, were, just, busting, your, butt, flat, out, flinging, the, car, and, all, that, he, knew, and, saw, that, he, was, all, in, had, no, other, interest, in, life, outside, of, motor, racing, and, all, of, the, intricacies, of, it, somewhat, misunderstood, in, many, ways, because, he, was, so, demanding, so, tough, on, everyone, but, at, the, end, of, the, day, he, was, correct, always, correct, and, that, s, why, you, had, the, respect, that, you, had, for, him, between, 1955, and, 1971, eight, ferrari, drivers, were, killed, driving, ferrari, racing, cars, alberto, ascari, eugenio, castellotti, alfonso, de, portago, luigi, musso, peter, collins, wolfgang, von, trips, lorenzo, bandini, and, ignazio, giunti, although, such, a, high, death, toll, was, not, unusual, in, motor, racing, in, those, days, the, vatican, newspaper, l, osservatore, romano, described, ferrari, as, being, like, the, god, saturn, who, consumed, his, own, sons, in, ferrari, s, defence, contemporary, f1, race, car, driver, stirling, moss, commented, i, can, t, think, of, a, single, occasion, where, a, ferrari, driver, s, life, was, taken, because, of, mechanical, failure, in, public, ferrari, was, careful, to, acknowledge, the, drivers, who, risked, their, life, for, his, team, insisting, that, praise, should, be, shared, equally, between, car, and, driver, for, any, race, won, however, his, longtime, friend, and, company, accountant, carlo, benzi, related, that, privately, ferrari, would, say, that, the, car, was, the, reason, for, any, success, following, the, deaths, of, giuseppe, campari, in, 1933, and, alberto, ascari, in, 1955, both, of, whom, he, had, a, strong, personal, relationship, with, he, chose, not, to, get, too, close, to, his, drivers, out, of, fear, of, emotionally, hurting, himself, later, in, life, he, relented, his, position, and, grew, very, close, to, clay, regazzoni, and, especially, gilles, villeneuve, enzo, ferrari, lived, a, reserved, life, and, rarely, granted, interviews, he, seldom, left, modena, and, maranello, and, never, went, to, any, grands, prix, outside, of, italy, after, the, 1950s, he, was, usually, seen, at, the, grands, prix, at, monza, near, milan, and, imola, not, far, from, the, ferrari, factory, where, the, circuit, was, named, after, the, late, dino, his, last, known, trip, abroad, was, in, 1982, when, he, went, to, paris, to, broker, a, compromise, between, the, warring, fisa, and, foca, parties, he, never, flew, in, an, aeroplane, and, never, set, foot, in, a, lift, ferrari, met, his, future, wife, laura, domenica, garello, c, 1900, 1978, in, turin, they, lived, together, for, two, years, and, married, on, 28, april, 1923, according, to, brock, yates, 1991, book, enzo, ferrari, the, man, and, the, machine, ferrari, married, to, keep, up, appearances, for, the, sake, of, his, career, as, divorce, was, frowned, upon, in, the, predominantly, catholic, italy, and, sought, sexual, conquests, not, so, much, for, pleasure, but, for, the, gratification, of, his, ego, according, to, yates, ferrari, once, remarked, to, racing, manager, romolo, tavoni, that, a, man, should, always, have, two, wives, and, at, one, point, in, 1961, when, he, was, dating, three, women, simultaneously, he, wrote, i, am, convinced, that, when, a, man, tells, a, woman, he, loves, her, he, only, means, that, he, desires, her, and, that, the, only, perfect, love, in, this, world, is, that, of, a, father, for, his, son, a, comment, that, came, several, years, after, the, death, of, his, first, son, ferrari, and, laura, s, one, son, alfredo, dino, who, was, born, in, 1932, and, groomed, as, enzo, s, successor, suffered, from, ill, health, and, died, from, muscular, dystrophy, in, 1956, according, to, time, magazine, ferrari, and, laura, s, love, for, their, son, is, what, kept, them, together, although, dino, never, raced, his, father, provided, him, with, a, fleet, of, cars, that, he, raced, for, pleasure, he, also, designed, engine, parts, while, bedridden, ferrari, and, laura, remained, married, until, her, death, in, 1978, john, nikas, writer, and, expert, on, the, history, of, cars, who, founded, the, british, sports, car, hall, of, fame, said, of, ferrari, his, real, loves, in, life, were, racing, and, dino, enzo, had, a, second, son, piero, with, his, mistress, lina, lardi, in, 1945, as, divorce, was, illegal, in, italy, until, 1970, piero, could, only, be, recognized, as, enzo, s, son, after, laura, s, death, in, 1978, piero, lardi, s, existence, was, kept, a, secret, known, only, to, a, few, of, his, father, s, confidantes, according, to, yates, there, is, no, question, that, at, some, point, in, the, late, 1950s, laura, ferrari, discovered, her, husband, s, second, life, and, openly, derided, him, as, a, bastard, when, she, saw, him, in, a, factory, after, laura, s, death, ferrari, adopted, piero, who, took, the, name, piero, lardi, ferrari, as, of, 2023, he, is, vice, chairman, of, the, company, and, owns, a, 10, share, of,

age, of, 90, of, leukemia, because, he, was, a, private, person, and, because, he, feared, popular, protests, due, to, the, fact, that, ferrari, s, team, had, been, beaten, by, mclaren, in, every, race, of, the, 1988, season, so, far, enzo, expressed, the, wish, for, his, death, to, be, reported, in, the, media, only, on, 16, august, the, day, after, his, burial, witnessed, only, by, his,
