the, purpose, of, distinguishing, the, identities, of, two, like, named, individuals, thus, giovanni, was, the, son, of, bicci, and, cosimo, s, name, was, properly, rendered, cosimo, di, giovanni, de, medici, he, was, born, along, with, a, twin, brother, damiano, who, survived, only, a, short, time, the, twins, were, named, after, saints, cosmas, and, damian, whose, feast, day, was, then,

branch, in, rome, independently, since, the, dissolution, of, the, latter, s, bank, into, three, separate, and, independent, entities, until, 1397, when, he, left, rome, to, return, to, florence, to, found, his, own, bank, the, medici, bank, over, the, next, two, decades, the, medici, bank, opened, branches, in, rome, geneva, venice, and, temporarily, in, naples, the, majority, of, profits, was, derived, from, rome, the, branch, manager, in, rome, was, a, papal, depositario, generale, who, managed, church, finances, in, return, for, a, commission, cosimo, would, later, expand, the, bank, throughout, western, europe, and, opened, offices, in, london, pisa, avignon, bruges, milan, and, l, beck, the, far, flung, branches, of, the, medici, rendered, it, the, best, bank, for, the, business, of, the, papacy, since, it, enabled, bishoprics, in, many, parts, of, europe, to, pay, their, fees, into, the, nearest, branch, whose, manager, would, then, issue, a, papal, license, and, the, popes, could, more, easily, order, a, variety, of, wares, such, as, spices, textiles, and, relics, through, the, bankers, wholesale, trade, in, fifteen, years, giovanni, would, make, a, profit, of, 290, 791, florins, in, 1415, cosimo, allegedly, accompanied, the, antipope, john, xxiii, at, the, council, of, constance, in, 1410, giovanni, lent, john, xxiii, then, simply, known, as, baldassare, cossa, the, money, to, buy, himself, the, office, of, cardinal, which, he, repaid, by, making, the, medici, bank, head, of, all, papal, finances, once, he, claimed, the, papacy, this, gave, the, medici, family, tremendous, power, allowing, them, for, instance, to, threaten, defaulting, debtors, with, excommunication, but, misfortune, hit, the, medici, bank, in, 1415, when, the, council, of, constance, unseated, john, xxiii, thus, taking, away, the, near, monopoly, they, had, held, on, the, finances, of, the, roman, curia, thereafter, the, medici, bank, had, to, compete, with, other, banks, however, after, the, spini, bank, of, florence, went, insolvent, in, 1420, they, again, secured, priority, john, xxiii, facing, the, enmity, of, a, church, council, at, which, he, was, accused, of, a, large, variety, of, offenses, against, the, church, was, confined, by, sigismund, holy, roman, emperor, to, heidelberg, castle, until, the, medici, paid, his, ransom, and, granted, him, asylum, in, the, same, year, as, john, s, dethronement, 1415, cosimo, was, named, priore, of, the, republic, later, he, acted, frequently, as, an, ambassador, for, florence, and, demonstrated, a, prudence, for, which, he, became, renowned, about, 1415, cosimo, married, contessina, de, bardi, the, daughter, of, alessandro, di, sozzo, bardi, count, of, vernio, and, camilla, pannocchieschi, the, wedding, was, arranged, by, his, father, as, an, effort, to, reaffirm, relations, with, the, long, standing, noble, bardi, family, who, had, operated, one, of, the, richest, banks, in, europe, until, its, spectacular, collapse, in, 1345, they, nevertheless, remained, highly, influential, in, the, financial, sphere, only, part, of, the, bardi, family, were, involved, in, this, marriage, alliance, for, some, of, the, branches, considered, themselves, the, opponents, of, the, medici, clan, the, couple, had, two, sons, piero, the, gouty, b, 1416, and, giovanni, de, medici, b, 1421, cosimo, also, had, an, illegitimate, son, carlo, by, a, circassian, slave, who, would, go, on, to, become, a, prelate, giovanni, withdrew, from, the, medici, bank, in, 1420, leaving, its, leadership, to, both, of, his, surviving, sons, he, left, them, 179, 221, florins, upon, his, death, in, 1429, two, thirds, of, this, came, from, the, business, in, rome, while, only, a, tenth, came, from, florence, even, venice, offered, better, returns, than, florence, the, brothers, would, earn, two, thirds, of, the, profits, from, the, bank, with, the, other, third, going, to, a, partner, besides, the, bank, the, family, owned, much, land, in, the, area, surrounding, florence, including, mugello, the, place, from, which, the, family, originally, came, cosimo, s, power, over, florence, stemmed, from, his, wealth, which, he, used, to, control, the, votes, of, office, holders, in, the, municipal, councils, most, importantly, the, signoria, of, florence, as, florence, was, proud, of, its, democracy, he, pretended, to, have, little, political, ambition, and, did, not, often, hold, public, office, enea, silvio, piccolomini, bishop, of, siena, and, later, pope, pius, ii, said, of, him, political, questions, are, settled, in, house, the, man, he, chooses, holds, office, he, is, who, decides, peace, and, war, he, is, king, in, all, but, name, in, 1433, cosimo, s, power, over, florence, began, to, look, like, a, menace, to, the, anti, medici, party, led, by, figures, such, as, palla, strozzi, and, the, albizzi, family, headed, by, rinaldo, degli, albizzi, in, september, of, that, year, cosimo, was, imprisoned, in, the, palazzo, vecchio, for, his, part, in, a, failure, to, conquer, the, republic, of, lucca, but, he, managed, to, turn, the, jail, term, into, one, of, exile, some, prominent, florentines, such, as, francesco, filelfo, demanded, his, execution, a, fate, that, may, have, been, almost, certain, without, the, intervention, of, the, monk, ambrogio, traversari, on, his, behalf, cosimo, travelled, to, padua, and, then, to, venice, taking, his, bank, along, with, him, and, finding, friends, and, sympathizers, wherever, he, went, for, his, willingness, to, accept, exile, rather, than, resume, the, bloody, conflicts, that, had, chronically, afflicted, the, streets, of, florence, venice, sent, an, envoy, to, florence, on, his, behalf, and, requested, that, they, rescind, the, order, of, banishment, when, they, refused, cosimo, settled, down, in, venice, his, brother, lorenzo, accompanying, him, however, prompted, by, his, influence, and, his, money, others, followed, him, such, as, the, architect, michelozzo, whom, cosimo, commissioned, to, design, a, library, as, a, gift, to, the, venetian, people, within, a, year, the, flight, of, capital, from, florence, was, so, great, that, the, decree, of, exile, had, to, be, lifted, cosimo, returned, a, year, later, in, 1434, to, influence, the, government, of, florence, especially, through, the, pitti, and, soderini, families, for, the, last, 30, years, of, his, life, of, 75, years, cosimo, s, time, in, exile, instilled, in, him, the, need, to, quash, the, factionalism, that, resulted, in, his, exile, in, the, first, place, in, order, to, do, this, he, instigated, a, series, of, constitutional, changes, with, the, help, of, favourable, priors, in, the, signoria, to, secure, his, power, through, influence, following, the, death, of, filippo, maria, visconti, who, had, ruled, the, duchy, of, milan, from, 1412, until, his, death, in, 1447, cosimo, sent, francesco, i, sforza, to, establish, himself, in, milan, to, prevent, an, impending, military, advance, from, the, republic, of, venice, francesco, sforza, was, a, condottiere, a, mercenary, soldier, who, had, stolen, land, from, the, papacy, and, proclaimed, himself, its, lord, he, had, yearned, to, establish, himself, at, milan, as, well, an, ambition, that, was, aided, by, the, fact, that, the, current, visconti, head, lacked, legitimate, children, save, for, a, daughter, bianca, whom, sforza, ultimately, married, in, november, 1441, after, a, failed, attempt, at, winning, her, hand, from, her, father, the, resultant, balance, of, power, with, milan, and, florence, on, the, one, side, and, venice, and, the, kingdom, of, naples, on, the, other, created, nearly, half, a, century, of, peace, that, enabled, the, development, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, however, despite, the, benefits, to, florence, from, keeping, venice, at, bay, the, intervention, in, milan, was, unpopular, among, cosimo, s, fellow, citizens, primarily, because, they, were, called, upon, to, finance, the, sforza, succession, the, milanese, made, a, brief, attempt, at, democracy, before, sforza, was, finally, acclaimed, duke, by, the, city, in, february, 1450, in, terms, of, foreign, policy, cosimo, worked, to, create, peace, in, northern, italy, through, the, creation, of, a, balance, of, power, between, florence, naples, venice, and, milan, during, the, wars, in, lombardy, between, 1423, and, 1454, and, the, discouragement, of, outside, powers, notably, the, french, and, the, holy, roman, empire, from, interfering, in, italian, affairs, in, 1439, he, was, instrumental, in, convincing, pope, eugene, iv, to, move, the, ecumenical, council, of, ferrara, to, florence, the, arrival, of, many, notable, byzantine, figures, from, the, eastern, roman, empire, including, emperor, john, viii, palaiologos, for, this, event, further, inspired, the, growing, interest, in, ancient, greek, arts, and, literature, the, father, of, a, line, of, princes, whose, name, and, age, are, almost, synonymous, with, the, restoration, of, learning, his, credit, was, ennobled, into, fame, his, riches, were, dedicated, to, the, service, of, mankind, he, corresponded, at, once, with, cairo, and, london, and, a, cargo, of, indian, spices, and, greek, books, were, often, imported, in, the, same, vessel, edward, gibbon, 1880, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, philadelphia, nottingham, society, pp, 456, 457, on, his, death, in, 1464, at, careggi, cosimo, was, succeeded, by, his, son, piero, father, of, lorenzo, the, magnificent, after, cosimo, s, death, the, signoria, awarded, him, the, title, pater, patriae, father, of, the, fatherland, an, honour, once, awarded, to, cicero, and, had, it, carved, upon, his, tomb, in, the, church, of, san, lorenzo, cosimo, de, medici, used, his, personal, fortune, to, control, the, florentine, political, system, and, to, sponsor, orators, poets, and, philosophers, as, well, as, a, series, of, artistic, accomplishments, cosimo, was, also, noted, for, his, patronage, of, culture, and, the, arts, during, the, renaissance, and, spent, the, family, fortune, liberally, to, enrich, the, civic, life, of, florence, according, to, salviati, s, zibaldone, cosimo, stated, all, those, things, have, given, me, the, greatest, satisfaction, and, contentment, because, they, are, not, only, for, the, honour, of, god, but, are, likewise, for, my, own, remembrance, for, fifty, years, i, have, done, nothing, else, but, earn, money, and, spend, money, and, it, became, clear, that, spending, money, gives, me, greater, pleasure, than, earning, it, additionally, his, patronage, of, the, arts, both, recognized, and, proclaimed, the, humanistic, responsibility, of, the, civic, duty, that, came, with, wealth, cosimo, hired, the, young, michelozzo, michelozzi, to, create, what, is, today, perhaps, the, prototypical, florentine, palazzo, the, austere, and, magnificent, palazzo, medici, the, building, still, includes, as, its, only, 15th, century, interior, that, is, largely, intact, the, magi, chapel, frescoed, by, benozzo, gozzoli, completed, in, 1461, with, portraits, of, members, of, the, medici, family, parading, through, tuscany, in, the, guise, of, the, three, wise, men, he, was, a, patron, and, confidante, of, fra, angelico, fra, filippo, lippi, and, donatello, whose, famed, david, and, judith, slaying, holofernes, were, medici, commissions, his, patronage, enabled, the, eccentric, and, bankrupt, architect, brunelleschi, to, complete, the, dome, of, santa, maria, del, fiore, the, duomo, in, 1436, cosimo, de, medici, a, citizen, of, rare, wisdom, and, inestimable, riches, and, therefore, most, celebrated, all, over, europe, especially, because, he, had, spent, over, 400, 000, ducats, in, building, churches, monasteries, and, other, sumptuous, edifices, not, only, in, his, own, country, but, in, many, other, parts, of, the, world, doing, all, this, with, admirable, magnificence, and, truly, regal, spirit, since, he, had, been, more, concerned, with, immortalizing, his, name, than, providing, for, his, descendants, francesco, guicciardini, the, history, of, italy, translated, by, sidney, alexander, princeton, n, j, princeton, university, press, p, 60, in, 1444, cosimo, de, medici, founded, the, first, public, library, in, florence, at, san, marco, which, was, of, central, importance, to, the, humanist, movement, in, florence, during, the, renaissance, it, was, designed, by, michelozzo, a, student, of, lorenzo, ghiberti, who, later, collaborated, with, donatello, and, was, also, a, good, friend, and, patron, to, cosimo, cosimo, contributed, the, funds, necessary, to, repair, the, library, and, provide, it, with, a, book, collection, which, people, were, allowed, to, use, at, no, charge, that, cosimo, de, medici, was, able, to, finance, the, construction, of, such, a, site, placed, him, in, a, privileged, position, of, leadership, in, the, city, he, hand, selected, those, individuals, who, were, given, access, to, this, laboratory, of, learning, and, through, this, social, dynamic, he, actively, shaped, the, politics, of, the, republic, he, also, commissioned, michelozzo, to, design, a, library, for, his, grandson, lorenzo, de, medici, his, first, library, however, was, designed, by, michelozzo, while, the, two, were, in, venice, where, cosimo, had, been, temporarily, exiled, in, 1433, in, gratitude, for, the, hospitality, of, that, city, he, left, it, as, a, gift, his, only, such, work, outside, florence, his, libraries, were, noted, for, their, renaissance, style, of, architecture, and, distinguished, artwork, cosimo, had, grown, up, with, only, three, books, but, by, the, time, he, was, thirty, his, collection, had, grown, to, 70, volumes, after, being, introduced, to, humanism, by, a, group, of, literati, who, had, asked, for, his, help, in, preserving, books, he, grew, to, love, the, movement, and, gladly, sponsored, the, effort, to, renew, greek, and, roman, civilization, through, literature, for, which, book, collecting, was, a, central, activity, heartened, by, the, romantic, wanderlust, of, a, true, bibliophile, the, austere, banker, even, embarked, on, several, journeys, in, the, hunt, for, books, while, guaranteeing, just, about, any, undertaking, that, involved, books, he, financed, trips, to, nearly, every, european, town, as, well, as, to, syria, egypt, and, greece, organized, by, poggio,

later, be, the, cornerstone, of, the, laurentian, library, a, library, in, florence, founded, by, cosimo, s, grandson, lorenzo, de, medici, in, the, realm, of, philosophy, cosimo, influenced, by, the,
