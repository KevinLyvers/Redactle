water, rights, were, not, clearly, assigned, and, the, colonial, authorities, were, not, especially, cooperative, as, a, result, in, 1859, dunant, decided, to, appeal, directly, to, french, emperor, napol, on, iii, who, was, with, his, army, in, lombardy, at, the, time, france, was, fighting, on, the, side, of, piedmont, sardinia, against, austria, in, the, austro, sardinian, war, napoleon, s, headquarters, were, located, in, the, small, city, of, solferino, dunant, wrote, a, flattering, book, full, of, praise, for, napoleon, iii, with, the, intention, to, present, it, to, the, emperor, and, then, traveled, to, solferino, to, meet, with, him, personally, dunant, arrived, in, solferino, on, the, evening, of, 24, june, 1859, on, the, same, day, a, battle, between, the, two, sides, had, occurred, nearby, forty, thousand, wounded, dying, and, dead, remained, on, the, battlefield, and, there, appeared, to, be, little, attempt, to, provide, care, shocked, dunant, himself, took, the, initiative, to, organize, the, civilian, population, especially, the, women, and, girls, to, provide, assistance, to, the, injured, and, sick, soldiers, they, lacked, sufficient, materials, and, supplies, and, dunant, himself, organized, the, purchase, of, needed, materials, and, helped, erect, makeshift, hospitals, he, convinced, the, population, to, service, the, wounded, without, regard, to, their, side, in, the, conflict, as, per, the, slogan, tutti, fratelli, all, are, brothers, coined, by, the, women, of, nearby, city, castiglione, delle, stiviere, he, also, succeeded, in, gaining, the, release, of, austrian, doctors, captured, by, the, french, and, british, after, returning, to, geneva, early, in, july, dunant, decided, to, write, a, book, about, his, experiences, which, he, titled, un, souvenir, de, solferino, a, memory, of, solferino, it, was, published, in, 1862, in, an, edition, of, 1, 600, copies, and, was, printed, at, dunant, s, own, expense, in, the, book, he, described, the, battle, its, costs, and, the, chaotic, circumstances, afterwards, he, also, developed, the, idea, that, in, the, future, a, neutral, organization, should, exist, to, provide, care, to, wounded, soldiers, he, distributed, the, book, to, many, leading, political, and, military, figures, in, europe, dunant, also, began, to, travel, through, europe, to, promote, his, ideas, his, book, was, largely, positively, received, and, the, president, of, the, geneva, society, for, public, welfare, jurist, gustave, moynier, made, the, book, and, its, suggestions, the, topic, of, the, 9, february, 1863, meeting, of, the, organization, dunant, s, recommendations, were, examined, and, positively, assessed, by, the, members, they, created, a, five, person, committee, to, further, pursue, the, possibility, of, their, implementation, and, made, dunant, one, of, the, members, the, others, were, moynier, the, swiss, army, general, henri, dufour, and, doctors, louis, appia, and, th, odore, maunoir, their, first, meeting, on, 17, february, 1863, is, now, considered, the, founding, date, of, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, from, early, on, moynier, and, dunant, had, increasing, disagreements, and, conflicts, regarding, their, respective, visions, and, plans, moynier, considered, dunant, s, idea, to, establish, neutrality, protections, for, care, providers, unfeasible, and, advised, dunant, not, to, insist, upon, this, concept, however, dunant, continued, to, advocate, this, position, in, his, travels, and, conversations, with, high, ranking, political, and, military, figures, this, intensified, the, personal, conflict, between, moynier, who, took, a, rather, pragmatic, approach, to, the, project, and, dunant, who, was, the, idealist, among, the, five, in, october, 1863, 14, states, took, part, in, a, meeting, in, geneva, organized, by, the, committee, to, discuss, the, improvement, of, care, for, wounded, soldiers, dunant, was, a, protocol, leader, during, the, meeting, a, year, later, on, 22, august, 1864, a, diplomatic, conference, organized, by, the, swiss, government, led, to, the, signing, of, the, first, geneva, convention, by, 12, states, dunant, was, in, charge, of, organizing, accommodation, for, the, attendees, dunant, s, businesses, in, algeria, had, suffered, in, april, 1867, the, bankruptcy, of, the, financial, firm, cr, dit, genevois, led, to, a, scandal, involving, dunant, he, declared, bankruptcy, the, social, outcry, in, geneva, a, city, deeply, rooted, in, calvinist, traditions, also, led, to, calls, for, him, to, separate, himself, from, the, international, committee, already, on, 25, august, 1867, he, resigned, as, secretary, and, on, 8, september, 1867, he, was, fully, removed, from, the, committee, dunant, was, condemned, by, the, geneva, trade, court, on, 17, august, 1868, for, deceptive, practices, in, the, bankruptcies, due, to, their, investments, in, the, firm, his, family, and, many, of, his, friends, were, also, heavily, affected, by, the, downfall, of, the, company, in, february, 1868, dunant, s, mother, died, later, that, year, he, was, expelled, from, the, ymca, because, he, was, the, geneva, founder, of, it, and, they, felt, his, business, failure, tainted, the, group, in, march, 1867, he, left, his, home, city, geneva, and, would, not, return, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, the, following, years, moynier, likely, used, his, influence, to, attempt, to, ensure, that, dunant, would, not, receive, assistance, and, support, from, his, friends, for, example, the, gold, medal, prize, of, sciences, morales, at, the, paris, world, s, fair, did, not, go, to, dunant, as, originally, planned, but, to, moynier, dufour, and, dunant, together, so, that, the, prize, money, would, only, go, to, the, committee, as, a, whole, napol, on, iii, s, offer, to, take, over, half, of, dunant, s, debts, if, dunant, s, friends, would, secure, the, other, half, was, also, thwarted, by, moynier, s, efforts, dunant, moved, to, paris, where, he, lived, in, meagre, conditions, however, he, continued, to, pursue, his, humanitarian, ideas, and, plans, during, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 1871, he, founded, the, common, relief, society, allgemeine, f, rsorgegesellschaft, and, soon, after, the, common, alliance, for, order, and, civilisation, allgemeine, allianz, f, r, ordnung, und, zivilisation, he, argued, for, disarmament, negotiations, and, for, the, erection, of, an, international, court, to, mediate, international, conflicts, later, he, worked, for, the, creation, of, a, world, library, an, idea, which, had, echoes, in, future, projects, such, as, unesco, in, his, continued, pursuit, and, advocacy, of, his, ideas, he, further, neglected, his, personal, situation, and, income, falling, further, in, debt, and, being, shunned, by, his, acquaintances, despite, being, appointed, an, honorary, member, of, the, national, red, cross, societies, of, austria, the, netherlands, sweden, prussia, and, spain, he, was, nearly, forgotten, in, the, official, discourse, of, the, red, cross, movement, even, as, it, was, rapidly, expanding, to, new, countries, he, lived, in, poverty, moving, to, various, places, between, 1874, and, 1886, including, stuttgart, rome, corfu, basel, and, karlsruhe, in, stuttgart, he, met, the, t, bingen, university, student, rudolf, m, ller, with, whom, he, would, have, a, close, friendship, in, 1881, together, with, friends, from, stuttgart, he, went, to, the, small, swiss, resort, village, heiden, for, the, first, time, in, 1887, while, living, in, london, he, began, to, receive, some, monthly, financial, support, from, some, distant, family, members, this, enabled, him, to, live, a, somewhat, more, secure, existence, and, he, moved, to, heiden, in, july, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, there, and, after, 30, april, 1892, he, lived, in, a, hospital, and, nursing, home, led, by, dr, hermann, altherr, in, heiden, he, met, the, young, teacher, wilhelm, sonderegger, and, his, wife, susanna, they, encouraged, him, to, record, his, life, experiences, sonderegger, s, wife, founded, a, branch, of, the, red, cross, in, heiden, and, in, 1890, dunant, became, its, honorary, president, with, sonderegger, dunant, hoped, to, further, promote, his, ideas, including, publishing, a, new, edition, of, his, book, however, their, friendship, later, was, strained, by, dunant, s, unjustified, accusations, that, sonderegger, with, moynier, in, geneva, was, somehow, conspiring, against, dunant, sonderegger, died, in, 1904, at, age, 42, despite, their, strained, relationship, dunant, was, deeply, moved, by, the, unexpected, death, wilhelm, and, susanna, sonderegger, s, admiration, for, dunant, felt, by, both, even, after, dunant, s, allegations, was, passed, on, to, their, children, in, 1935, their, son, ren, published, a, compilation, of, letters, from, dunant, to, his, father, in, september, 1895, georg, baumberger, the, chief, editor, of, the, st, gall, newspaper, die, ostschweiz, wrote, an, article, about, the, red, cross, founder, whom, he, had, met, and, conversed, with, during, a, walk, in, heiden, a, month, earlier, the, article, entitled, henri, dunant, the, founder, of, the, red, cross, appeared, in, the, german, illustrated, magazine, ber, land, und, meer, and, the, article, was, soon, reprinted, in, other, publications, throughout, europe, the, article, struck, a, chord, and, he, received, renewed, attention, and, support, he, received, the, swiss, binet, fendt, prize, and, a, note, from, pope, leo, xiii, because, of, support, from, russian, tsarist, widow, maria, feodorovna, and, other, donations, his, financial, situation, improved, remarkably, in, 1897, rudolf, m, ller, who, was, now, working, as, a, teacher, in, stuttgart, wrote, a, book, about, the, origins, of, the, red, cross, altering, the, official, history, to, stress, dunant, s, role, the, book, also, contained, the, text, of, a, memory, of, solferino, dunant, began, an, exchange, of, correspondence, with, bertha, von, suttner, and, wrote, numerous, articles, and, writings, he, was, especially, active, in, writing, about, women, s, rights, and, in, 1897, facilitated, the, founding, of, a, green, cross, women, s, organization, whose, only, section, was, briefly, active, in, brussels, in, 1901, dunant, was, awarded, the, first, ever, nobel, peace, prize, for, his, role, in, founding, the, international, red, cross, movement, and, initiating, the, geneva, convention, by, public, and, private, means, m, ller, and, later, norwegian, military, physician, hans, daae, who, had, received, a, copy, of, m, ller, s, book, advocated, dunant, s, case, to, the, nobel, committee, over, the, course, of, 4, years, the, award, was, jointly, given, to, french, pacifist, fr, d, ric, passy, founder, of, the, peace, league, and, active, with, dunant, in, the, alliance, for, order, and, civilization, the, official, congratulations, which, he, received, from, the, international, committee, finally, represented, the, rehabilitation, of, dunant, s, reputation, there, is, no, man, who, more, deserves, this, honour, for, it, was, you, forty, years, ago, who, set, on, foot, the, international, organization, for, the, relief, of, the, wounded, on, the, battlefield, without, you, the, red, cross, the, supreme, humanitarian, achievement, of, the, nineteenth, century, would, probably, have, never, been, undertaken, moynier, and, the, international, committee, as, a, whole, had, also, been, nominated, for, the, prize, although, dunant, was, supported, by, a, broad, spectrum, in, the, selection, process, he, was, still, a, controversial, candidate, some, argued, that, the, red, cross, and, the, geneva, convention, had, made, war, more, attractive, and, imaginable, by, eliminating, some, of, its, suffering, therefore, m, ller, in, a, letter, to, the, committee, argued, that, the, prize, should, be, divided, between, dunant, and, passy, who, for, some, time, in, the, debate, had, been, the, leading, candidate, to, be, the, sole, recipient, of, the, prize, m, ller, also, suggested, that, if, a, prize, were, to, be, warranted, for, dunant, it, should, be, given, immediately, because, of, his, advanced, age, and, ill, health, by, dividing, the, prize, between, passy, a, pacifist, and, dunant, a, humanitarian, the, nobel, committee, set, a, precedent, for, the, conditions, of, the, nobel, peace, prize, selection, which, would, have, significant, consequences, in, later, years, a, section, of, nobel, s, will, had, indicated, that, the, prize, should, go, to, an, individual, who, had, worked, to, reduce, or, eliminate, standing, armies, or, directly, to, promote, peace, conferences, which, made, passy, a, natural, choice, for, his, peace, work, on, the, other, hand, the, arguably, distinct, bestowal, for, humanitarian, effort, alone, was, seen, by, some, as, a, wide, interpretation, of, nobel, s, will, however, another, part, of, nobel, s, testament, marked, the, prize, for, the, individual, who, had, best, enhanced, the, brotherhood, of, people, which, could, be, interpreted, more, generally, as, seeing, humanitarian, work, like, dunant, s, as, connected, to, peacemaking, as, well, many, recipients, of, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, later, years, can, be, assigned, to, either, of, these, two, categories, first, roughly, established, by, the, nobel, committee, s, decision, in, 1901, hans, daae, succeeded, in, placing, dunant, s, part, of, the, prize, money, 104, 000, swiss, francs, in, a, norwegian, bank, and, preventing, access, by, his, creditors, dunant, himself, never, spent, any, of, the, money, during, his, lifetime, continuing, to, live, simply, and, reserving, it, for, bequests, in, his, will, to, those, who, cared, for, him, and, charitable, causes, among, several, other, awards, in, the, following, years, in, 1903, dunant, was, given, an, honorary, doctorate, by, the, medical, faculty, of, the, university, of, heidelberg, he, lived, in, the, nursing, home, in, heiden, until, his, death, in, the, final, years, of, his, life, he, suffered, from, depression, and, paranoia, about, pursuit, by, his, creditors, and, moynier, there, were, even, days, when, dunant, insisted, that, the, cook, of, the, nursing, home, first, taste, his, food, before, his, eyes, to, protect, him, against, possible, poisoning, in, his, final, years, he, spurned, and, attacked, calvinism, and, organized, religion, generally, he, was, said, to, be, agnostic, according, to, his, nurses, the, final, act, of, his, life, was, to, send, a, copy, of, m, ller, s, book, to, the, italian, queen, with, a, personal, dedication, he, died, on, 30, october, 1910, and, his, final, words, were, where, has, humanity, gone, according, to, his, wishes, he, was, buried, without, ceremony, in, the, sihlfeld, cemetery, in, z, rich, in, his, will, he, donated, funds, to, secure, a, free, bed, in, the, heiden, nursing, home, always, to, be, available, for, a, poor, citizen, of, the, region, and, deeded, some, money, to, friends, and, charitable, organizations, in, norway, and, switzerland, the, remaining, funds, went, to, his, creditors, partially, relieving, his, debt, his, inability, to, fully, erase, his, debts, was, a, major, burden, to, him, until, his, death, his, birthday, 8, may, is, celebrated, as, the, world, red, cross, and, red, crescent, day, the, former, nursing, home, in, heiden, now, houses, the, henry, dunant, museum, in, geneva, and, other, places, there, are, numerous, streets, squares, and, schools, named, after, him, the, henry, dunant, medal, awarded, every, two, years, by, the, standing, commission, of, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, is, its, highest, decoration, his, life, is, represented, with, some, fictional, elements, in, the, film, d, homme, hommes, 1948, starring, jean, louis, barrault, and, the, period, of, his, life, when, the, red, cross, was, founded, in, the, international, film, coproduction, henry, dunant,
