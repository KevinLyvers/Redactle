opposition, to, the, voting, rights, of, african, americans, stanton, was, quoted, to, have, said, it, becomes, a, serious, question, whether, we, had, better, stand, aside, and, let, sambo, walk,

a, critical, examination, of, the, bible, that, is, based, on, the, premise, that, its, attitude, toward, women, reflects, prejudice, from, a, less, civilized, age, elizabeth, cady, was, born, into,

three, african, american, manservants, in, her, household, when, she, was, young, researchers, have, determined, that, one, of, them, peter, teabout, was, a, slave, and, probably, remained, so, until, all, enslaved, people, in, new, york, state, were, freed, on, july, 4, 1827, stanton, recalled, him, fondly, saying, that, she, and, her, sisters, attended, the, episcopal, church, with, teabout, and, sat, with, him, in, the, back, of, the, church, rather, than, in, front, with, the, white, families, stanton, received, a, better, education, than, most, women, of, her, era, she, attended, johnstown,

became, a, skilled, debater, she, enjoyed, her, years, at, the, school, and, said, she, did, not, encounter, any, barriers, there, due, to, her, gender, she, was, made, sharply, aware, of, society, s,

mother, were, incapacitated, by, grief, the, ten, year, old, stanton, tried, to, comfort, her, father, saying, she, would, try, to, be, all, her, brother, had, been, her, father, said, oh, my, daughter, i, wish, you, were, a, boy, stanton, had, many, educational, opportunities, as, a, young, child, their, neighbor, reverend, simon, hosack, taught, her, greek, and, mathematics, edward, bayard, her, brother, in, law, and, eleazar, s, former, classmate, at, union, college, taught, her, philosophy, and, horsemanship, her, father, brought, her, law, books, to, study, so, she, could, participate, in, debates, with, his, law, clerks, at, the, dinner, table, she, wanted, to, go, to, college, but, no, colleges, at, that, time, accepted, female, students, moreover, her, father, initially, decided, she, did, not, need, further, education, he, eventually, agreed, to, enroll, her, in, the, troy, female, seminary, in, troy, new, york, which, was, founded, and, run, by, emma, willard, in, her, memoirs, stanton, said, that, during, her, student, days, in, troy, she, was, greatly, disturbed, by, a, six, week, religious, revival, conducted, by, charles, grandison, finney, an, evangelical, preacher, and, a, central, figure, in, the, revivalist, movement, his, preaching, combined, with, the, calvinistic, presbyterianism, of, her, childhood, terrified, her, with, the, possibility, of, her, own, damnation, fear, of, judgment, seized, my, soul, visions, of, the, lost, haunted, my, dreams, mental, anguish, prostrated, my, health, stanton, credited, her, father, and, brother, in, law, with, convincing, her, to, disregard, finney, s, warnings, she, said, they, took, her, on, a, six, week, trip, to, niagara, falls, during, which, she, read, works, of, rational, philosophers, who, restored, her, reason, and, sense, of, balance, lori, d, ginzberg, one, of, stanton, s, biographers, says, there, are, problems, with, this, story, for, one, thing, finney, did, not, preach, for, six, weeks, in, troy, while, stanton, was, there, ginzberg, suspects, that, stanton, embellished, a, childhood, memory, to, underline, her, belief, that, women, harm, themselves, by, falling, under, the, spell, of, religion, as, a, young, woman, stanton, traveled, often, to, the, home, of, her, cousin, gerrit, smith, who, also, lived, in, upstate, new, york, his, views, were, very, different, from, those, of, her, conservative, father, smith, was, an, abolitionist, and, a, member, of, the, secret, six, a, group, of, men, who, financed, john, brown, s, raid, on, harpers, ferry, in, an, effort, to, spark, an, armed, uprising, of, enslaved, african, americans, at, smith, s, home, where, she, spent, summers, and, was, considered, part, of, the, family, she, met, henry, brewster, stanton, a, prominent, abolitionist, agent, despite, her, father, s, reservations, the, couple, married, in, 1840, omitting, the, word, obey, from, the, marriage, ceremony, stanton, later, wrote, i, obstinately, refused, to, obey, one, with, whom, i, supposed, i, was, entering, into, an, equal, relation, while, uncommon, this, practice, was, not, unheard, of, quakers, had, been, omitting, obey, from, the, marriage, ceremony, for, some, time, stanton, took, her, husband, s, surname, as, part, of, her, own, signing, herself, elizabeth, cady, stanton, or, e, cady, stanton, but, not, mrs, henry, b, stanton, soon, after, returning, from, their, european, honeymoon, the, stantons, moved, into, the, cady, household, in, johnstown, henry, stanton, studied, law, under, his, father, in, law, until, 1843, when, the, stantons, moved, to, boston, chelsea, massachusetts, where, henry, joined, a, law, firm, while, living, in, boston, elizabeth, enjoyed, the, social, political, and, intellectual, stimulation, that, came, with, a, constant, round, of, abolitionist, gatherings, here, she, was, influenced, by, such, people, as, frederick, douglass, william, lloyd, garrison, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, in, 1847, the, stantons, moved, to, seneca, falls, new, york, in, the, finger, lakes, region, their, house, which, is, now, a, part, of, the, women, s, rights, national, historical, park, was, purchased, for, them, by, elizabeth, s, father, the, couple, had, seven, children, at, that, time, child, bearing, was, considered, to, be, a, subject, that, should, be, handled, with, great, delicacy, stanton, took, a, different, approach, raising, a, flag, in, front, of, her, house, after, giving, birth, a, red, flag, for, a, boy, and, a, white, one, for, a, girl, one, of, her, daughters, harriot, stanton, blatch, became, like, her, mother, a, leader, of, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, because, of, the, spacing, of, their, children, s, births, one, historian, has, concluded, that, the, stantons, must, have, used, birth, control, methods, stanton, herself, said, her, children, were, conceived, by, what, she, called, voluntary, motherhood, in, an, era, when, it, was, commonly, held, that, a, wife, must, submit, to, her, husband, s, sexual, demands, stanton, believed, that, women, should, have, command, over, their, sexual, relationships, and, childbearing, she, also, said, however, that, a, healthy, woman, has, as, much, passion, as, a, man, stanton, encouraged, both, her, sons, and, daughters, to, pursue, a, broad, range, of, interests, activities, and, learning, she, was, remembered, by, her, daughter, margaret, as, being, cheerful, sunny, and, indulgent, she, enjoyed, motherhood, and, running, a, large, household, but, she, found, herself, unsatisfied, and, even, depressed, by, the, lack, of, intellectual, companionship, and, stimulation, in, seneca, falls, during, the, 1850s, henry, s, work, as, a, lawyer, and, politician, kept, him, away, from, home, for, nearly, 10, months, out, of, every, year, this, frustrated, elizabeth, when, the, children, were, small, because, it, made, it, difficult, for, her, to, travel, the, pattern, continued, in, later, years, with, husband, and, wife, living, apart, more, often, than, together, maintaining, separate, households, for, several, years, their, marriage, which, lasted, 47, years, ended, with, henry, stanton, s, death, in, 1887, both, henry, and, elizabeth, were, staunch, abolitionists, but, henry, like, elizabeth, s, father, disagreed, with, the, idea, of, female, suffrage, one, biographer, described, henry, as, at, best, a, halfhearted, women, s, rights, man, while, on, their, honeymoon, in, england, in, 1840, the, stantons, attended, the, world, anti, slavery, convention, in, london, elizabeth, was, appalled, by, the, convention, s, male, delegates, who, voted, to, prevent, women, from, participating, even, if, they, had, been, appointed, as, delegates, of, their, respective, abolitionist, societies, the, men, required, the, women, to, sit, in, a, separate, section, hidden, by, curtains, from, the, convention, s, proceedings, william, lloyd, garrison, a, prominent, american, abolitionist, and, supporter, of, women, s, rights, who, arrived, after, the, vote, had, been, taken, refused, to, sit, with, the, men, and, sat, with, the, women, instead, lucretia, mott, a, quaker, minister, abolitionist, and, women, s, rights, advocate, was, one, of, the, women, who, had, been, sent, as, a, delegate, although, mott, was, much, older, than, stanton, they, quickly, bonded, in, an, enduring, friendship, with, stanton, eagerly, learning, from, the, more, experienced, activist, while, in, london, stanton, heard, mott, preach, in, a, unitarian, chapel, the, first, time, stanton, had, heard, a, woman, give, a, sermon, or, even, speak, in, public, stanton, later, gave, credit, to, this, convention, for, focusing, her, interests, on, women, s, rights, an, accumulation, of, experiences, was, having, an, effect, on, stanton, the, london, convention, had, been, a, turning, point, in, her, life, her, study, of, law, books, had, convinced, her, that, legal, changes, were, necessary, to, overcome, gender, inequities, she, had, personal, experience, of, the, stultifying, role, of, women, as, wives, and, housekeepers, she, said, the, wearied, anxious, look, of, the, majority, of, women, impressed, me, with, a, strong, feeling, that, some, active, measures, should, be, taken, to, remedy, the, wrongs, of, society, in, general, and, of, women, in, particular, this, knowledge, however, did, not, immediately, lead, to, action, relatively, isolated, from, other, social, reformers, and, fully, occupied, with, household, duties, she, was, at, a, loss, as, to, how, she, could, engage, in, social, reform, in, the, summer, of, 1848, lucretia, mott, traveled, from, pennsylvania, to, attend, a, quaker, meeting, near, the, stanton, s, home, stanton, was, invited, to, visit, with, mott, and, three, other, progressive, quaker, women, finding, herself, in, sympathetic, company, stanton, said, she, poured, out, her, long, accumulating, discontent, with, such, vehemence, and, indignation, that, i, stirred, myself, as, well, as, the, rest, of, the, party, to, do, and, dare, anything, the, gathered, women, agreed, to, organize, a, women, s, rights, convention, in, seneca, falls, a, few, days, later, while, mott, was, still, in, the, area, the, history, of, mankind, is, a, history, of, repeated, injuries, and, usurpation, on, the, part, of, man, toward, woman, having, in, direct, object, the, establishment, of, an, absolute, tyranny, over, her, he, has, not, ever, permitted, her, to, exercise, her, inalienable, right, to, the, elective, franchise, he, has, compelled, her, to, submit, to, laws, in, the, formation, of, which, she, had, no, voice, elizabeth, cady, stanton, the, declaration, of, sentiments, of, the, seneca, falls, convention, stanton, was, the, primary, author, of, the, convention, s, declaration, of, rights, and, sentiments, which, was, modeled, on, the, u, s, declaration, of, independence, its, list, of, grievances, included, the, wrongful, denial, of, women, s, right, to, vote, signaling, stanton, s, intent, to, generate, a, discussion, of, women, s, suffrage, at, the, convention, this, was, a, highly, controversial, idea, at, the, time, but, not, an, entirely, new, one, her, cousin, gerrit, smith, no, stranger, to, radical, ideas, himself, had, called, for, women, s, suffrage, shortly, before, at, the, liberty, league, convention, in, buffalo, when, henry, stanton, saw, the, inclusion, of, women, s, suffrage, in, the, document, he, told, his, wife, that, she, was, acting, in, a, way, that, would, turn, the, proceedings, into, a, farce, lucretia, mott, the, main, speaker, was, also, disturbed, by, the, proposal, an, estimated, 300, women, and, men, attended, the, two, day, seneca, falls, convention, in, her, first, address, to, a, large, audience, stanton, explained, the, purpose, of, the, gathering, and, the, importance, of, women, s, rights, following, a, speech, by, mott, stanton, read, the, declaration, of, sentiments, which, the, attendees, were, invited, to, sign, next, came, the, resolutions, all, of, which, the, convention, adopted, unanimously, except, for, the, ninth, which, read, it, is, the, duty, of, the, women, of, this, country, to, secure, to, themselves, the, sacred, right, of, the, elective, franchise, following, a, vigorous, debate, this, resolution, was, adopted, only, after, frederick, douglass, an, abolitionist, leader, who, had, formerly, been, enslaved, gave, it, his, strong, support, stanton, s, sister, harriet, attended, the, convention, and, signed, its, declaration, of, sentiments, her, husband, however, made, her, remove, her, signature, although, this, was, a, local, convention, organized, on, short, notice, its, controversial, nature, ensured, that, it, was, widely, noted, in, the, press, with, articles, appearing, in, newspapers, in, new, york, city, philadelphia, and, many, other, places, the, seneca, falls, convention, is, now, recognized, as, an, historic, event, the, first, convention, to, be, called, for, the, purpose, of, discussing, women, s, rights, the, convention, s, declaration, of, sentiments, became, the, single, most, important, factor, in, spreading, news, of, the, women, s, rights, movement, around, the, country, in, 1848, and, into, the, future, according, to, judith, wellman, a, historian, of, the, convention, the, convention, initiated, the, use, of, women, s, rights, conventions, as, organizing, tools, for, the, early, women, s, movement, by, the, time, of, the, second, national, women, s, rights, convention, in, 1851, the, demand, for, women, s, right, to, vote, had, become, a, central, tenet, of, the, united, states, women, s, rights, movement, a, rochester, women, s, rights, convention, was, held, in, rochester, new, york, two, weeks, later, organized, by, local, women, who, had, attended, the, one, in, seneca, falls, both, stanton, and, mott, spoke, at, this, convention, the, convention, in, seneca, falls, had, been, chaired, by, james, mott, the, husband, of, lucretia, mott, the, rochester, convention, was, chaired, by, a, woman, abigail, bush, another, historic, first, many, people, were, disturbed, by, the, idea, of, a, woman, chairing, a, convention, of, both, men, and, women, how, for, example, might, people, react, if, a, woman, ruled, a, man, out, of, order, stanton, herself, spoke, in, opposition, to, the, election, of, a, woman, as, the, chair, of, this, convention, although, she, later, acknowledged, her, mistake, and, apologized, for, her, action, when, the, first, national, women, s, rights, convention, was, organized, in, 1850, stanton, was, unable, to, attend, because, she, was, pregnant, instead, she, sent, a, letter, to, the, convention, entitled, should, women, hold, office, that, outlined, the, movement, s, goals, the, letter, emphatically, endorsed, women, s, right, to, hold, office, stating, that, women, might, have, a, purifying, elevating, softening, influence, on, the, political, experiment, of, our, republic, thereafter, it, became, a, tradition, to, open, national, women, s, rights, conventions, with, a, letter, by, stanton, who, did, not, participate, in, person, in, a, national, convention, until, 1860, while, visiting, seneca, falls, in, 1851, susan, b, anthony, was, introduced, to, stanton, by, amelia, bloomer, a, mutual, friend, and, a, supporter, of, women, s, rights, anthony, who, was, five, years, younger, than, stanton, came, from, a, quaker, family, that, was, active, in, reform, movements, anthony, and, stanton, soon, became, close, friends, and, co, workers, forming, a, relationship, that, was, a, turning, point, in, their, lives, and, of, great, importance, to, the, women, s, movement, the, two, women, had, complementary, skills, anthony, excelled, at, organizing, while, stanton, had, an, aptitude, for, intellectual, matters, and, writing, stanton, later, said, in, writing, we, did, better, work, together, than, either, could, alone, while, she, is, slow, and, analytical, in, composition, i, am, rapid, and, synthetic, i, am, the, better, writer, she, the, better, critic, anthony, deferred, to, stanton, in, many, ways, throughout, their, years, of, work, together, not, accepting, an, office, in, any, organization, that, would, place, her, above, stanton, in, their, letters, they, referred, to, one, another, as, susan, and, mrs, stanton, because, stanton, was, homebound, with, seven, children, while, anthony, was, unmarried, and, free, to, travel, anthony, assisted, stanton, by, supervising, her, children, while, stanton, wrote, among, other, things, this, allowed, stanton, to, write, speeches, for, anthony, to, give, one, of, anthony, s, biographers, said, susan, became, one, of, the, family, and, was, almost, another, mother, to, mrs, stanton, s, children, one, of, stanton, s, biographers, said, stanton, provided, the, ideas, rhetoric, and, strategy, anthony, delivered, the, speeches, circulated, petitions, and, rented, the, halls, anthony, prodded, and, stanton, produced, stanton, s, husband, said, susan, stirred, the, puddings, elizabeth, stirred, up, susan, and, then, susan, stirs, up, the, world, stanton, herself, said, i, forged, the, thunderbolts, she, fired, them, by, 1854, anthony, and, stanton, had, perfected, a, collaboration, that, made, the, new, york, state, movement, the, most, sophisticated, in, the, country, according, to, ann, d, gordon, a, professor, of, women, s, history, after, the, stantons, moved, from, seneca, falls, to, new, york, city, in, 1861, a, room, was, set, aside, for, anthony, in, every, house, they, lived, in, one, of, stanton, s, biographers, estimated, that, over, her, lifetime, stanton, spent, more, time, with, anthony, than, with, any, other, adult, including, her, own, husband, in, december, 1865, stanton, and, anthony, submitted, the, first, women, s, suffrage, petition, directed, to, congress, during, the, drafting, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, the, women, challenged, the, use, of, the, word, male, in, the, version, submitted, to, the, states, for, ratification, when, congress, failed, to, remove, the, language, stanton, announced, her, candidacy, as, the, first, woman, to, run, for, congress, in, october, 1866, she, ran, as, an, independent, and, secured, only, 24, votes, but, her, candidacy, sparked, conversations, surrounding, women, s, officeholding, separate, from, suffrage, in, december, 1872, stanton, and, anthony, each, wrote, new, departure, memorials, to, congress, and, were, invited, to, read, their, memorials, to, the, senate, judiciary, committee, this, further, brought, women, s, suffrage, and, officeholding, to, the, forefront, of, congress, s, agenda, even, though, the, new, departure, agenda, was, ultimately, rejected, the, relationship, was, not, without, its, strains, especially, as, anthony, could, not, match, stanton, s, charm, and, charisma, in, 1871, anthony, said, whoever, goes, into, a, parlor, or, before, an, audience, with, that, woman, does, it, at, the, cost, of, a, fearful, overshadowing, a, price, which, i, have, paid, for, the, last, ten, years, and, that, cheerfully, because, i, felt, that, our, cause, was, most, profited, by, her, being, seen, and, heard, and, my, best, work, was, making, the, way, clear, for, her, excessive, consumption, of, alcohol, was, a, severe, social, problem, during, this, period, one, that, began, to, diminish, only, in, the, 1850s, many, activists, considered, temperance, to, be, a, women, s, rights, issue, because, of, laws, that, gave, husbands, complete, control, of, the, family, and, its, finances, the, law, provided, almost, no, recourse, to, a, woman, with, a, drunken, husband, even, if, his, condition, left, the, family, destitute, and, he, was, abusive, to, her, and, their, children, if, she, managed, to, obtain, a, divorce, which, was, difficult, to, do, he, could, easily, end, up, with, sole, guardianship, of, their, children, in, 1852, anthony, was, elected, as, a, delegate, to, the, new, york, state, temperance, convention, when, she, tried, to, participate, in, the, discussion, the, chairman, stopped, her, saying, that, women, delegates, were, there, only, to, listen, and, learn, years, later, anthony, observed, no, advanced, step, taken, by, women, has, been, so, bitterly, contested, as, that, of, speaking, in, public, for, nothing, which, they, have, attempted, not, even, to, secure, the, suffrage, have, they, been, so, abused, condemned, and, antagonized, anthony, and, other, women, walked, out, and, announced, their, intention, to, organize, a, women, s, temperance, convention, later, that, year, about, five, hundred, women, met, in, rochester, and, created, the, women, s, state, temperance, society, with, stanton, as, president, and, anthony, as, state, agent, this, leadership, arrangement, with, stanton, in, the, public, role, as, president, and, anthony, as, the, energetic, force, behind, the, scenes, was, characteristic, of, the, organizations, they, founded, in, later, years, in, her, first, public, speech, since, 1848, stanton, delivered, the, convention, s, keynote, address, one, that, antagonized, religious, conservatives, she, called, for, drunkenness, to, be, legal, grounds, for, divorce, at, a, time, when, many, conservatives, opposed, divorce, for, any, reason, she, appealed, for, wives, of, drunkard, husbands, to, take, control, of, their, marital, relations, saying, let, no, woman, remain, in, relation, of, wife, with, the, confirmed, drunkard, let, no, drunkard, be, the, father, of, her, children, she, attacked, the, religious, establishment, calling, for, women, to, donate, their, money, to, the, poor, instead, of, to, the, education, of, young, men, for, the, ministry, for, the, building, up, a, theological, aristocracy, and, gorgeous, temples, to, the, unknown, god, at, the, organization, s, convention, the, following, year, conservatives, voted, stanton, out, as, president, whereupon, she, and, anthony, resigned, from, the, organization, temperance, was, not, a, significant, reform, activity, for, stanton, afterwards, although, she, continued, to, use, local, temperance, societies, in, the, early, 1850s, as, conduits, for, advocating, women, s, rights, she, regularly, wrote, articles, for, the, lily, a, monthly, temperance, newspaper, that, she, helped, transform, into, one, that, reported, news, of, the, women, s, rights, movement, she, also, wrote, for, the, una, a, women, s, rights, periodical, edited, by, paulina, wright, davis, and, for, the, new, york, tribune, a, daily, newspaper, edited, by, horace, greeley, the, status, of, married, women, at, that, time, was, in, part, set, by, english, common, law, which, for, centuries, had, set, the, doctrine, of, coverture, in, local, courts, it, held, wives, were, under, the, protection, and, control, of, their, husbands, in, the, words, of, william, blackstone, s, 1769, book, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, by, marriage, the, husband, and, wife, are, one, person, in, law, that, is, the, very, being, or, legal, existence, of, the, woman, is, suspended, during, the, marriage, the, husband, of, a, married, woman, became, the, owner, of, any, property, she, brought, into, a, marriage, she, could, not, sign, contracts, operate, a, business, in, her, own, name, or, retain, custody, of, their, children, in, the, event, of, a, divorce, in, practice, some, american, courts, followed, the, common, law, some, southern, states, like, texas, and, florida, provided, more, equality, for, women, across, the, country, state, legislatures, were, taking, control, away, from, common, law, traditions, by, passing, legislation, in, 1836, the, new, york, legislature, began, considering, a, married, women, s, property, act, with, women, s, rights, advocate, ernestine, rose, an, early, supporter, who, circulated, petitions, in, its, favor, stanton, s, father, supported, this, reform, having, no, sons, to, pass, his, considerable, wealth, to, he, was, faced, with, the, prospect, of, having, it, eventually, pass, to, the, control, of, his, daughters, husbands, stanton, circulated, petitions, and, lobbied, legislators, in, favor, of, the, proposed, law, as, early, as, 1843, the, law, eventually, passed, in, 1848, it, allowed, a, married, woman, to, retain, the, property, that, she, possessed, before, the, marriage, or, acquired, during, the, marriage, and, it, protected, her, property, from, her, husband, s, creditors, enacted, shortly, before, the, seneca, falls, convention, it, strengthened, the, women, s, rights, movement, by, increasing, the, ability, of, women, to, act, independently, by, weakening, the, traditional, belief, that, husbands, spoke, for, their, wives, it, assisted, many, of, the, reforms, that, stanton, championed, such, as, the, right, of, women, to, speak, in, public, and, to, vote, in, 1853, susan, b, anthony, organized, a, petition, campaign, in, new, york, state, for, an, improved, property, rights, law, for, married, women, as, part, of, the, presentation, of, these, petitions, to, the, legislature, stanton, spoke, in, 1854, to, a, joint, session, of, the, judiciary, committee, arguing, that, voting, rights, were, needed, to, enable, women, to, protect, their, newly, won, property, rights, in, 1860, stanton, spoke, again, to, the, judiciary, committee, this, time, before, a, large, audience, in, the, assembly, chamber, arguing, that, women, s, suffrage, was, the, only, real, protection, for, married, women, their, children, and, their, material, assets, she, pointed, to, similarities, in, the, legal, status, of, woman, and, slaves, saying, the, prejudice, against, color, of, which, we, hear, so, much, is, no, stronger, than, that, against, sex, it, is, produced, by, the, same, cause, and, manifested, very, much, in, the, same, way, the, negro, s, skin, and, the, woman, s, sex, are, both, prima, facie, evidence, that, they, were, intended, to, be, in, subjection, to, the, white, saxon, man, the, legislature, passed, the, improved, law, in, 1860, in, 1851, elizabeth, smith, miller, stanton, s, cousin, brought, a, new, style, of, dress, to, the, upstate, new, york, area, unlike, traditional, floor, length, dresses, it, consisted, of, pantaloons, worn, under, a, knee, length, dress, amelia, bloomer, stanton, s, friend, and, neighbor, publicized, the, attire, in, the, lily, a, monthly, magazine, that, she, published, thereafter, it, was, popularly, known, as, the, bloomer, dress, or, just, bloomers, it, was, soon, adopted, by, many, female, reform, activists, despite, harsh, ridicule, from, traditionalists, who, considered, the, idea, of, women, wearing, any, sort, of, trousers, as, a, threat, to, the, social, order, to, stanton, it, solved, the, problem, of, climbing, stairs, with, a, baby, in, one, hand, a, candle, in, the, other, and, somehow, also, lifting, the, skirt, of, a, long, dress, to, avoid, tripping, stanton, wore, bloomers, for, two, years, abandoning, the, attire, only, after, it, became, clear, that, the, controversy, it, created, was, distracting, people, from, the, campaign, for, women, s, rights, other, women, s, rights, activists, eventually, did, the, same, stanton, had, already, antagonized, traditionalists, in, 1852, at, the, women, s, temperance, convention, by, advocating, a, woman, s, right, to, divorce, a, drunken, husband, in, an, hour, long, speech, at, the, tenth, national, women, s, rights, convention, in, 1860, she, went, further, generating, a, heated, debate, that, took, up, an, entire, session, she, cited, tragic, examples, of, unhealthy, marriages, suggesting, that, some, marriages, amounted, to, legalized, prostitution, she, challenged, both, the, sentimental, and, the, religious, views, of, marriage, defining, marriage, as, a, civil, contract, subject, to, the, same, restrictions, of, any, other, contract, if, a, marriage, did, not, produce, the, expected, happiness, she, said, then, it, would, be, a, duty, to, end, it, strong, opposition, to, her, speech, was, voiced, in, the, ensuing, discussion, abolitionist, leader, wendell, phillips, arguing, that, divorce, was, not, a, women, s, rights, issue, because, it, affected, both, women, and, men, equally, said, the, subject, was, out, of, order, and, tried, unsuccessfully, to, have, it, removed, from, the, record, in, later, years, on, the, lecture, circuit, stanton, s, speech, on, divorce, was, one, of, her, most, popular, drawing, audiences, of, up, to, 1200, people, in, an, 1890, essay, entitled, divorce, versus, domestic, warfare, stanton, opposed, calls, by, some, women, activists, for, stricter, divorce, laws, saying, the, rapidly, increasing, number, of, divorces, far, from, showing, a, lower, state, of, morals, proves, exactly, the, reverse, woman, is, in, a, transition, period, from, slavery, to, freedom, and, she, will, not, accept, the, conditions, and, married, life, that, she, has, heretofore, meekly, endured, in, 1860, stanton, published, a, pamphlet, called, the, slaves, appeal, written, from, what, she, imagined, to, be, the, viewpoint, of, a, female, slave, the, fictional, speaker, uses, vivid, religious, language, men, and, women, of, new, york, the, god, of, thunder, speaks, through, you, that, expresses, religious, views, very, different, from, those, that, stanton, herself, held, the, speaker, describes, the, horrors, of, slavery, saying, the, trembling, girl, for, whom, thou, didst, pay, a, price, but, yesterday, in, a, new, orleans, market, is, not, thy, lawful, wife, foul, and, damning, both, to, the, master, and, the, slave, is, this, wholesale, violation, of, the, immutable, laws, of, god, the, pamphlet, called, for, defiance, of, the, federal, fugitive, slave, act, and, it, included, petitions, to, be, used, for, opposing, the, practice, of, hunting, escaped, slaves, in, 1861, anthony, organized, a, tour, of, abolitionist, lecturers, in, upstate, new, york, that, included, stanton, and, several, other, speakers, the, tour, began, in, january, just, after, south, carolina, had, seceded, from, the, union, but, before, other, states, had, seceded, and, before, the, outbreak, of, war, in, her, speech, stanton, said, that, south, carolina, was, like, a, willful, son, whose, behavior, jeopardized, the, whole, family, and, that, the, best, course, of, action, was, to, let, it, secede, the, lecture, meetings, were, repeatedly, disrupted, by, mobs, operating, under, the, belief, that, abolitionist, activity, was, causing, southern, states, to, secede, stanton, was, not, able, to, participate, in, some, of, the, lectures, because, she, had, to, return, home, to, her, children, at, her, husband, s, urging, she, left, the, lecture, tour, because, of, the, persistent, threat, of, violence, in, 1863, anthony, moved, into, the, stantons, house, in, new, york, city, and, the, two, women, began, organizing, the, women, s, loyal, national, league, to, campaign, for, an, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, that, would, abolish, slavery, stanton, became, president, of, the, new, organization, and, anthony, was, secretary, it, was, the, first, national, women, s, political, organization, in, the, united, states, in, the, largest, petition, drive, in, the, nation, s, history, up, to, that, time, the, league, collected, nearly, 400, 000, signatures, to, abolish, slavery, representing, approximately, one, out, of, every, twenty, four, adults, in, the, northern, states, the, petition, drive, significantly, assisted, the, passage, of, the, thirteenth, amendment, which, ended, slavery, the, league, disbanded, in, 1864, after, it, became, clear, that, the, amendment, would, be, approved, although, its, purpose, was, the, abolition, of, slavery, the, league, made, it, clear, that, it, also, stood, for, political, equality, for, women, approving, a, resolution, at, its, founding, convention, that, called, for, equal, rights, for, all, citizens, regardless, of, race, or, sex, the, league, indirectly, advanced, the, cause, of, women, s, rights, in, several, ways, stanton, pointedly, reminded, the, public, that, petitioning, was, the, only, political, tool, available, to, women, at, a, time, when, only, men, were, allowed, to, vote, the, success, of, the, league, s, petition, drive, demonstrated, the, value, of, formal, organization, to, the, women, s, movement, which, had, traditionally, resisted, being, anything, other, than, loosely, organized, up, to, that, point, its, 5000, members, constituted, a, widespread, network, of, women, activists, who, gained, experience, that, helped, create, a, pool, of, talent, for, future, forms, of, social, activism, including, suffrage, stanton, and, anthony, emerged, from, this, endeavor, with, significant, national, reputations, after, the, civil, war, stanton, and, anthony, became, alarmed, at, reports, that, the, proposed, fourteenth, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, which, would, provide, citizenship, for, african, americans, would, also, for, the, first, time, introduce, the, word, male, into, the, constitution, stanton, said, if, that, word, male, be, inserted, it, will, take, us, a, century, at, least, to, get, it, out, organizing, opposition, to, this, development, required, preparation, because, the, women, s, movement, had, become, largely, inactive, during, the, civil, war, in, january, 1866, stanton, and, anthony, sent, out, petitions, calling, for, a, constitutional, amendment, providing, for, women, s, suffrage, with, stanton, s, name, at, the, top, of, the, list, of, signatures, stanton, and, anthony, organized, the, eleventh, national, women, s, rights, convention, in, may, 1866, the, first, since, the, civil, war, began, the, convention, voted, to, transform, itself, into, the, american, equal, rights, association, aera, whose, purpose, was, to, campaign, for, the, equal, rights, of, all, citizens, regardless, of, race, or, sex, especially, the, right, of, suffrage, stanton, was, offered, the, post, of, president, but, declined, in, a, favor, of, lucretia, mott, other, officers, included, stanton, as, first, vice, president, anthony, as, a, corresponding, secretary, frederick, douglass, as, a, vice, president, and, lucy, stone, as, a, member, of, the, executive, committee, stanton, provided, hospitality, for, some, of, the, attendees, at, this, convention, sojourner, truth, an, abolitionist, and, women, s, rights, activist, who, had, formerly, been, enslaved, stayed, at, stanton, s, house, as, of, course, did, anthony, leading, abolitionists, opposed, the, aera, s, drive, for, universal, suffrage, horace, greeley, a, prominent, newspaper, editor, told, anthony, and, stanton, this, is, a, critical, period, for, the, republican, party, and, the, life, of, our, nation, i, conjure, you, to, remember, that, this, is, the, negro, s, hour, abolitionist, leaders, wendell, phillips, and, theodore, tilton, arranged, a, meeting, with, stanton, and, anthony, trying, to, convince, them, that, the, time, had, not, yet, come, for, women, s, suffrage, that, they, should, campaign, for, voting, rights, for, black, men, only, not, for, all, african, americans, and, all, women, the, two, women, rejected, this, guidance, and, continued, to, work, for, universal, suffrage, in, 1866, stanton, declared, herself, a, candidate, for, congress, the, first, woman, to, do, so, she, said, that, although, she, could, not, vote, there, was, nothing, in, the, constitution, to, prevent, her, from, running, for, congress, running, as, an, independent, against, both, the, democrat, and, republican, candidates, she, received, only, 24, votes, her, campaign, was, noted, by, newspapers, as, far, away, as, new, orleans, in, 1867, the, aera, campaigned, in, kansas, for, referendums, that, would, enfranchise, both, african, americans, and, women, wendell, phillips, who, opposed, mixing, those, two, causes, blocked, the, funding, that, the, aera, had, expected, for, their, campaign, by, the, end, of, summer, the, aera, campaign, had, almost, collapsed, and, its, finances, were, exhausted, anthony, and, stanton, created, a, storm, of, controversy, by, accepting, help, during, the, last, days, of, the, campaign, from, george, francis, train, a, wealthy, businessman, who, supported, women, s, rights, train, antagonized, many, activists, by, attacking, the, republican, party, and, openly, disparaging, the, integrity, and, intelligence, of, african, americans, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, stanton, and, anthony, hoped, to, draw, the, volatile, train, away, from, his, cruder, forms, of, racism, and, that, he, had, actually, begun, to, do, so, in, any, case, stanton, said, she, would, accept, support, from, the, devil, himself, if, he, supported, women, s, suffrage, after, the, ratification, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, in, 1868, a, sharp, dispute, erupted, within, the, aera, over, the, proposed, fifteenth, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, which, would, prohibit, the, denial, of, suffrage, because, of, race, stanton, and, anthony, opposed, the, amendment, which, would, have, the, effect, of, enfranchising, black, men, insisting, that, all, women, and, all, african, americans, should, be, enfranchised, at, the, same, time, stanton, argued, in, the, pages, of, the, revolution, that, by, effectively, enfranchising, all, men, while, excluding, all, women, the, amendment, would, create, an, aristocracy, of, sex, giving, constitutional, authority, to, the, idea, that, men, were, superior, to, women, lucy, stone, who, was, emerging, as, a, leader, of, those, who, were, opposed, to, stanton, and, anthony, argued, that, suffrage, for, women, would, be, more, beneficial, to, the, country, than, suffrage, for, black, men, but, supported, the, amendment, saying, i, will, be, thankful, in, my, soul, if, any, body, can, get, out, of, the, terrible, pit, during, the, debate, over, the, fifteenth, amendment, stanton, wrote, articles, for, the, revolution, with, language, that, was, elitist, and, racially, condescending, she, believed, that, a, long, process, of, education, would, be, needed, before, many, of, the, former, slaves, and, immigrant, workers, would, be, able, to, participate, meaningfully, as, voters, stanton, wrote, american, women, of, wealth, education, virtue, and, refinement, if, you, do, not, wish, the, lower, orders, of, chinese, africans, germans, and, irish, with, their, low, ideas, of, womanhood, to, make, laws, for, you, and, your, daughters, demand, that, women, too, shall, be, represented, in, government, in, another, article, stanton, objected, to, laws, being, made, for, women, by, patrick, and, sambo, and, hans, and, yung, tung, who, do, not, know, the, difference, between, a, monarchy, and, a, republic, she, also, used, the, term, sambo, on, other, occasions, drawing, a, rebuke, from, her, old, friend, frederick, douglass, douglass, strongly, supported, women, s, suffrage, but, said, that, suffrage, for, african, americans, was, a, more, urgent, issue, literally, a, matter, of, life, and, death, he, said, that, white, women, already, exerted, a, positive, influence, on, government, through, the, voting, power, of, their, husbands, fathers, and, brothers, and, that, it, does, not, seem, generous, for, anthony, and, stanton, to, insist, that, black, men, should, not, achieve, suffrage, unless, women, achieved, it, at, the, same, time, sojourner, truth, on, the, other, hand, supported, stanton, s, position, saying, if, colored, men, get, their, rights, and, not, colored, women, theirs, you, see, the, colored, men, will, be, masters, over, the, women, and, it, will, be, just, as, bad, as, it, was, before, early, in, 1869, stanton, called, for, a, sixteenth, amendment, that, would, provide, suffrage, for, women, saying, the, male, element, is, a, destructive, force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving, war, violence, conquest, acquisition, in, the, dethronement, of, woman, we, have, let, loose, the, elements, of, violence, and, ruin, that, she, only, has, the, power, to, curb, the, aera, increasingly, divided, into, two, wings, each, advocating, universal, suffrage, but, with, different, approaches, one, wing, whose, leading, figure, was, lucy, stone, was, willing, for, black, men, to, achieve, suffrage, first, and, wanted, to, maintain, close, ties, with, the, republican, party, and, the, abolitionist, movement, the, other, whose, leading, figures, were, stanton, and, anthony, insisted, that, all, women, and, all, african, americans, should, be, enfranchised, at, the, same, time, and, worked, toward, a, women, s, movement, that, would, no, longer, be, tied, to, the, republican, party, or, be, financially, dependent, on, abolitionists, the, aera, effectively, dissolved, after, an, acrimonious, meeting, in, may, 1869, and, two, competing, woman, suffrage, organizations, were, created, in, its, aftermath, in, the, words, of, one, of, stanton, s, biographers, one, consequence, of, the, split, for, stanton, was, that, old, friends, became, either, enemies, like, lucy, stone, or, wary, associates, as, in, the, case, of, frederick, douglass, the, establishing, of, woman, on, her, rightful, throne, is, the, greatest, revolution, the, world, has, ever, known, or, ever, will, know, elizabeth, cady, stanton, in, 1868, anthony, and, stanton, began, publishing, a, sixteen, page, weekly, newspaper, called, the, revolution, in, new, york, city, stanton, was, co, editor, along, with, parker, pillsbury, an, experienced, editor, who, was, an, abolitionist, and, a, supporter, of, women, s, rights, anthony, the, owner, managed, the, business, aspects, of, the, paper, initial, funding, was, provided, by, george, francis, train, the, controversial, businessman, who, supported, women, s, rights, but, who, alienated, many, activists, with, his, political, and, racial, views, the, newspaper, focused, primarily, on, women, s, rights, especially, suffrage, for, women, but, it, also, covered, topics, such, as, politics, the, labor, movement, and, finance, one, of, its, stated, goals, was, to, provide, a, forum, in, which, women, could, exchange, opinions, on, key, issues, its, motto, was, men, their, rights, and, nothing, more, women, their, rights, and, nothing, less, sisters, harriet, beecher, stowe, and, isabella, beecher, hooker, offered, to, provide, funding, for, the, newspaper, if, its, name, was, changed, to, something, less, inflammatory, but, stanton, declined, their, offer, strongly, favoring, its, existing, name, their, goal, was, to, grow, the, revolution, into, a, daily, paper, with, its, own, printing, press, all, owned, and, operated, by, women, the, funding, that, train, had, arranged, for, the, newspaper, however, was, less, than, expected, moreover, train, sailed, for, england, after, the, revolution, published, its, first, issue, and, was, soon, jailed, for, supporting, irish, independence, train, s, financial, support, eventually, disappeared, entirely, after, twenty, nine, months, mounting, debts, forced, the, transfer, of, the, paper, to, a, wealthy, women, s, rights, activist, who, gave, it, a, less, radical, tone, despite, the, relatively, short, time, it, was, in, their, hands, the, revolution, gave, stanton, and, anthony, a, means, for, expressing, their, views, during, the, developing, split, within, the, women, s, movement, it, also, helped, them, promote, their, wing, of, the, movement, which, eventually, became, a, separate, organization, stanton, refused, to, take, responsibility, for, the, 10, 000, debt, the, newspaper, had, accumulated, saying, she, had, children, to, support, anthony, who, had, less, money, than, stanton, took, responsibility, for, the, debt, repaying, it, over, a, six, year, period, through, paid, speaking, tours, in, may, 1869, two, days, after, the, final, aera, convention, stanton, anthony, and, others, formed, the, national, woman, suffrage, association, nwsa, with, stanton, as, president, six, months, later, lucy, stone, julia, ward, howe, and, others, formed, the, rival, american, woman, suffrage, association, awsa, which, was, larger, and, better, funded, the, immediate, cause, for, the, split, in, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, was, the, proposed, fifteenth, amendment, but, the, two, organizations, had, other, differences, as, well, the, nwsa, was, politically, independent, while, the, awsa, aimed, for, close, ties, with, the, republican, party, hoping, that, ratification, of, the, fifteenth, amendment, would, lead, to, republican, support, for, women, s, suffrage, the, nwsa, focused, primarily, on, winning, suffrage, at, the, national, level, while, the, awsa, pursued, a, state, by, state, strategy, the, nwsa, initially, worked, on, a, wider, range, of, women, s, issues, than, the, awsa, including, divorce, reform, and, equal, pay, for, women, as, the, new, organization, was, being, formed, stanton, proposed, to, limit, its, membership, to, women, but, her, proposal, was, not, accepted, in, practice, however, the, overwhelming, majority, of, its, members, and, officers, were, women, stanton, disliked, many, aspects, of, organizational, work, because, it, interfered, with, her, ability, to, study, think, and, write, she, begged, anthony, without, success, to, arrange, the, nwsa, s, first, convention, so, that, she, herself, would, not, need, to, attend, for, the, rest, of, her, life, stanton, attended, conventions, only, reluctantly, if, at, all, wanting, to, maintain, the, freedom, to, express, her, opinions, without, worrying, about, who, in, the, organization, might, be, offended, of, the, fifteen, nwsa, meetings, between, 1870, and, 1879, stanton, presided, at, four, and, was, present, at, only, one, other, leaving, anthony, effectively, in, charge, of, the, organization, in, 1869, francis, and, virginia, minor, husband, and, wife, suffragists, from, missouri, developed, a, strategy, based, on, the, idea, that, the, u, s, constitution, implicitly, enfranchised, women, it, relied, heavily, on, the, fourteenth, amendment, which, says, no, state, shall, make, or, enforce, any, law, which, shall, abridge, the, privileges, or, immunities, of, citizens, of, the, united, states, nor, deny, to, any, person, within, its, jurisdiction, the, equal, protection, of, the, laws, in, 1871, the, nwsa, officially, adopted, what, had, become, known, as, the, new, departure, strategy, encouraging, women, to, attempt, to, vote, and, to, file, lawsuits, if, denied, that, right, soon, hundreds, of, women, tried, to, vote, in, dozens, of, localities, susan, b, anthony, actually, succeeded, in, voting, in, 1872, for, which, she, was, arrested, and, found, guilty, in, a, widely, publicized, trial, in, 1880, stanton, also, tried, to, vote, when, the, election, officials, refused, to, let, her, place, her, ballot, in, the, box, she, threw, it, at, them, when, the, supreme, court, ruled, in, 1875, in, minor, v, happersett, that, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, does, not, confer, the, right, of, suffrage, upon, anyone, the, nwsa, decided, to, pursue, the, far, more, difficult, strategy, of, campaigning, for, a, constitutional, amendment, that, would, guarantee, voting, rights, for, women, in, 1878, stanton, and, anthony, convinced, senator, aaron, a, sargent, to, introduce, into, congress, a, women, s, suffrage, amendment, that, more, than, forty, years, later, would, be, ratified, as, the, nineteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, its, text, is, identical, to, that, of, the, fifteenth, amendment, except, that, it, prohibits, the, denial, of, suffrage, because, of, sex, rather, than, race, color, or, previous, condition, of, servitude, stanton, traveled, with, her, daughter, harriet, to, europe, in, may, 1882, and, did, not, return, for, a, year, and, a, half, already, a, public, figure, of, some, prominence, in, europe, she, gave, several, speeches, there, and, wrote, reports, for, american, newspapers, she, visited, her, son, theodore, in, france, where, she, met, her, first, grandchild, and, traveled, to, england, for, harriet, s, marriage, to, an, englishman, after, anthony, joined, her, in, england, in, march, 1883, they, traveled, together, to, meet, with, leaders, of, european, women, s, movements, laying, the, groundwork, for, an, international, women, s, organization, stanton, and, anthony, returned, to, the, u, s, together, in, november, 1883, hosted, by, the, nwsa, delegates, from, fifty, three, women, s, organizations, in, nine, countries, met, in, washington, in, 1888, to, form, the, organization, that, stanton, and, anthony, had, been, working, toward, the, international, council, of, women, icw, which, is, still, active, stanton, traveled, again, to, europe, in, october, 1886, visiting, her, children, in, france, and, england, she, returned, to, the, u, s, in, march, 1888, barely, in, time, to, deliver, a, major, speech, at, the, founding, meeting, of, the, icw, when, anthony, discovered, that, stanton, had, not, yet, written, her, speech, she, insisted, that, stanton, stay, in, her, hotel, room, until, she, had, written, it, and, she, placed, a, younger, colleague, outside, her, door, to, make, sure, she, did, so, stanton, later, teased, anthony, saying, well, as, all, women, are, supposed, to, be, under, the, thumb, of, some, man, i, prefer, a, tyrant, of, my, own, sex, so, i, shall, not, deny, the, patent, fact, of, my, subjection, the, convention, succeeded, in, bringing, increased, publicity, and, respectability, to, the, women, s, movement, especially, when, president, grover, cleveland, honored, the, delegates, by, inviting, them, to, a, reception, at, the, white, house, despite, her, record, of, racially, insensitive, remarks, and, occasional, appeals, to, the, racial, prejudices, of, white, people, stanton, applauded, the, marriage, in, 1884, of, her, friend, frederick, douglass, to, helen, pitts, a, white, woman, a, marriage, that, enraged, racists, stanton, wrote, douglass, a, warm, letter, of, congratulation, to, which, douglass, responded, that, he, had, been, sure, that, she, would, be, happy, for, him, when, anthony, realized, that, stanton, was, planning, to, publish, her, letter, she, convinced, her, not, to, do, so, wanting, to, avoid, associating, women, s, suffrage, with, an, unrelated, and, divisive, issue, in, 1876, anthony, moved, into, stanton, s, house, in, new, jersey, to, begin, working, with, stanton, on, the, history, of, woman, suffrage, she, brought, with, her, several, trunks, and, boxes, of, letters, newspaper, clippings, and, other, documents, originally, envisioned, as, a, modest, publication, that, could, be, produced, quickly, the, history, evolved, into, a, six, volume, work, of, more, than, 5700, pages, written, over, a, period, of, 41, years, the, first, three, volumes, which, cover, the, movement, up, to, 1885, were, produced, by, stanton, anthony, and, matilda, joslyn, gage, anthony, handled, the, production, details, and, the, correspondence, with, contributors, stanton, wrote, most, of, the, first, three, volumes, with, gage, writing, three, chapters, of, the, first, volume, and, stanton, writing, the, rest, gage, was, forced, to, abandon, the, project, afterwards, because, of, the, illness, of, her, husband, after, stanton, s, death, anthony, published, volume, 4, with, the, help, of, ida, husted, harper, after, anthony, s, death, harper, completed, the, last, two, volumes, which, brought, the, history, up, to, 1920, stanton, and, anthony, encouraged, their, rival, lucy, stone, to, assist, with, the, work, or, at, least, to, send, material, that, could, be, used, by, someone, else, to, write, the, history, of, her, wing, of, the, movement, but, she, refused, to, cooperate, in, any, way, stanton, s, daughter, harriot, stanton, blatch, who, had, returned, from, europe, to, assist, with, the, editing, insisted, that, the, history, would, not, be, taken, seriously, if, stone, and, the, awsa, were, not, included, she, herself, wrote, a, 120, page, chapter, on, stone, and, the, awsa, which, appears, in, volume, 2, the, history, of, woman, suffrage, preserves, an, enormous, amount, of, material, that, might, have, been, lost, forever, written, by, leaders, of, one, wing, of, the, divided, women, s, movement, it, does, not, however, give, a, balanced, view, of, events, where, their, rivals, are, concerned, it, overstates, the, role, of, stanton, and, anthony, and, it, understates, or, ignores, the, roles, of, stone, and, other, activists, who, did, not, fit, into, the, historical, narrative, they, had, developed, because, it, was, for, years, the, main, source, of, documentation, about, the, suffrage, movement, historians, have, had, to, uncover, other, sources, to, provide, a, more, balanced, view, stanton, worked, as, a, lecturer, for, the, new, york, bureau, of, the, redpath, lyceum, from, late, 1869, until, 1879, this, organization, was, part, of, the, lyceum, movement, which, arranged, for, speakers, and, entertainers, to, tour, the, country, often, visiting, small, communities, where, educational, opportunities, and, theaters, were, scarce, for, ten, years, stanton, traveled, eight, months, of, the, year, on, the, lecture, circuit, usually, delivering, one, lecture, per, day, two, on, sundays, she, also, arranged, smaller, meetings, with, local, women, who, were, interested, in, women, s, rights, traveling, was, sometimes, difficult, one, year, when, deep, snow, closed, the, railroads, stanton, hired, a, sleigh, and, kept, going, bundled, in, furs, to, protect, against, freezing, weather, during, 1871, she, and, anthony, traveled, together, for, three, months, through, several, western, states, eventually, arriving, in, california, her, most, popular, lecture, our, girls, urged, young, women, to, be, independent, and, to, seek, self, fulfillment, in, the, antagonism, of, sex, she, addressed, the, question, of, women, s, rights, with, a, special, fervor, other, popular, lectures, were, our, boys, co, education, marriage, and, divorce, and, the, subjugation, of, women, on, sundays, she, would, often, speak, on, famous, women, in, the, bible, and, the, bible, and, women, s, rights, her, earnings, were, impressive, during, her, first, three, months, on, the, road, stanton, reported, she, cleared, 2000, above, all, expenses, besides, stirring, women, generally, up, to, rebellion, accounting, for, inflation, that, would, be, about, 63, 100, in, today, s, dollars, because, her, husband, s, income, had, always, been, erratic, and, he, had, invested, it, badly, the, money, she, earned, was, welcome, especially, with, most, of, their, children, either, in, college, or, soon, to, begin, after, 15, years, in, seneca, falls, stanton, moved, to, new, york, city, in, 1862, when, her, husband, secured, the, position, of, deputy, collector, for, the, port, of, new, york, their, son, neil, who, worked, for, henry, as, his, clerk, was, caught, taking, bribes, causing, both, father, and, son, to, lose, their, jobs, henry, worked, intermittently, afterward, as, a, journalist, and, a, lawyer, when, her, father, died, in, 1859, stanton, received, an, inheritance, worth, an, estimated, 50, 000, or, about, 1, 700, 000, in, today, s, dollars, in, 1868, she, bought, a, substantial, country, house, near, tenafly, new, jersey, an, hour, s, ride, by, train, from, new, york, city, the, stanton, house, in, tenafly, is, now, a, national, historic, landmark, henry, remained, in, the, city, in, a, rented, apartment, aside, from, visits, she, and, henry, afterward, mostly, lived, apart, six, of, the, seven, stanton, children, graduated, from, college, colleges, were, closed, to, women, when, stanton, sought, higher, education, but, both, of, her, daughters, were, educated, at, vassar, college, because, graduate, studies, were, not, yet, available, to, women, in, the, u, s, harriet, enrolled, in, a, master, s, program, in, france, which, she, abandoned, after, she, became, engaged, to, be, married, harriet, earned, a, master, s, degree, from, vassar, at, the, age, of, 35, after, 1884, henry, began, to, spend, more, time, at, tenafly, in, 1885, just, before, his, 80th, birthday, he, published, a, short, autobiography, called, random, recollections, in, it, he, said, that, he, had, married, the, daughter, of, the, famous, judge, cady, but, he, did, not, provide, her, name, in, the, third, edition, of, his, book, he, mentioned, his, wife, by, name, a, single, time, he, died, in, 1887, while, she, was, in, england, visiting, their, daughter, the, fifteenth, amendment, was, ratified, in, 1870, removing, much, of, the, original, reason, for, the, split, in, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, as, early, as, 1875, anthony, began, urging, the, nwsa, to, focus, more, tightly, on, women, s, suffrage, instead, of, a, variety, of, women, s, issues, which, brought, it, closer, to, the, awsa, s, approach, the, rivalry, between, the, two, organizations, remained, bitter, however, as, the, awsa, began, to, decline, in, strength, during, the, 1880s, in, the, late, 1880s, alice, stone, blackwell, daughter, of, awsa, leader, lucy, stone, began, working, to, heal, the, breach, among, the, older, generation, of, leaders, anthony, warily, cooperated, with, this, effort, but, stanton, did, not, disappointed, that, both, organizations, wanted, to, focus, almost, exclusively, on, suffrage, she, wrote, to, a, friend, lucy, susan, alike, see, suffrage, only, they, do, not, see, women, s, religious, social, bondage, neither, do, the, young, women, in, either, association, hence, they, may, as, well, combine, in, 1890, the, two, organizations, merged, as, the, national, american, woman, suffrage, association, nawsa, at, anthony, s, insistence, stanton, accepted, its, presidency, despite, her, unease, at, the, direction, of, the, new, organization, in, her, speech, at, the, founding, convention, she, urged, it, to, work, on, a, broad, range, of, women, s, issues, and, called, for, it, to, include, all, races, creeds, and, classes, including, mormon, indian, and, black, women, the, day, after, she, was, elected, president, stanton, sailed, to, her, daughter, s, home, in, england, where, she, stayed, for, eighteen, months, leaving, anthony, effectively, in, charge, when, stanton, declined, reelection, to, the, presidency, at, the, 1892, convention, anthony, was, elected, to, that, post, in, 1892, stanton, delivered, the, speech, that, became, known, as, the, solitude, of, self, three, different, times, in, as, many, days, twice, to, congressional, committees, and, once, as, her, final, address, to, the, nawsa, she, considered, it, her, best, speech, and, many, others, agreed, lucy, stone, printed, it, in, its, entirety, in, the, woman, s, journal, in, the, space, where, her, own, speech, normally, would, have, appeared, in, pursuit, of, her, lifelong, quest, to, overturn, the, belief, that, women, were, lesser, beings, than, men, and, therefore, not, suited, for, independence, stanton, said, in, this, speech, that, women, must, develop, themselves, acquiring, an, education, and, nourishing, an, inner, strength, a, belief, in, themselves, self, sovereignty, was, the, essential, element, in, a, woman, s, life, not, her, role, as, daughter, wife, or, mother, stanton, said, no, matter, how, much, women, prefer, to, lean, to, be, protected, and, supported, nor, how, much, men, desire, to, have, them, do, so, they, must, make, the, voyage, of, life, alone, stanton, said, she, had, been, terrified, as, a, child, by, a, minister, s, talk, of, damnation, but, after, overcoming, those, fears, with, the, help, of, her, father, and, brother, in, law, had, rejected, that, type, of, religion, entirely, as, an, adult, her, religious, views, continued, to, evolve, while, living, in, boston, in, the, 1840s, she, was, attracted, to, the, preaching, of, theodore, parker, who, like, her, cousin, gerritt, smith, was, a, member, of, the, secret, six, a, group, of, men, who, financed, john, brown, s, raid, on, harpers, ferry, in, an, effort, to, spark, an, armed, slave, rebellion, parker, was, a, transcendentalist, and, a, prominent, unitarian, minister, who, taught, that, the, bible, need, not, be, taken, literally, that, god, need, not, be, envisioned, as, a, male, and, that, individual, men, and, women, had, the, ability, to, determine, religious, truth, for, themselves, in, the, declaration, of, sentiments, written, for, the, 1848, seneca, falls, convention, stanton, listed, a, series, of, grievances, against, males, who, among, other, things, excluded, women, from, the, ministry, and, other, leading, roles, in, religion, in, one, of, those, grievances, stanton, said, that, man, has, usurped, the, prerogative, of, jehovah, himself, claiming, it, as, his, right, to, assign, for, her, a, sphere, of, action, when, that, belongs, to, her, conscience, and, her, god, this, was, the, only, grievance, that, was, not, a, matter, of, fact, such, as, exclusion, of, women, from, colleges, from, the, right, to, vote, etc, but, one, of, belief, one, that, challenged, a, fundamental, basis, of, authority, and, autonomy, the, years, after, the, civil, war, saw, a, significant, increase, in, the, variety, of, women, s, social, reform, organizations, and, the, number, of, activists, in, them, stanton, was, uneasy, about, the, belief, held, by, many, of, these, activists, that, government, should, enforce, christian, ethics, through, such, actions, as, teaching, the, bible, in, public, schools, and, strengthening, sunday, closing, laws, in, her, speech, at, the, 1890, unity, convention, that, established, the, nawsa, stanton, said, i, hope, this, convention, will, declare, that, the, woman, suffrage, association, is, opposed, to, all, union, of, church, and, state, and, pledges, itself, to, maintain, the, secular, nature, of, our, government, do, all, you, can, no, matter, what, to, get, people, to, think, on, your, reform, and, then, if, the, reform, is, good, it, will, come, about, in, due, season, elizabeth, cady, stanton, diary, entry, in, 1898, in, 1895, stanton, published, the, woman, s, bible, a, provocative, examination, of, the, bible, that, questioned, its, status, as, the, word, of, god, and, attacked, the, way, it, was, being, used, to, relegate, women, to, an, inferior, status, stanton, wrote, most, of, it, with, the, assistance, of, several, other, women, including, matilda, joslyn, gage, who, had, assisted, with, the, history, of, woman, suffrage, in, it, stanton, methodically, worked, her, way, through, the, bible, quoting, selected, passages, and, commenting, on, them, often, sarcastically, a, best, seller, with, seven, printings, in, six, months, it, was, translated, into, several, languages, a, second, volume, was, published, in, 1898, the, book, created, a, storm, of, controversy, that, affected, the, entire, women, s, rights, movement, stanton, could, not, have, been, surprised, having, earlier, told, an, acquaintance, well, if, we, who, do, see, the, absurdities, of, the, old, superstitions, never, unveil, them, to, others, how, is, the, world, to, make, any, progress, in, the, theologies, i, am, in, the, sunset, of, life, and, i, feel, it, to, be, my, special, mission, to, tell, people, what, they, are, not, prepared, to, hear, the, process, of, critically, examining, the, text, of, the, bible, known, as, historical, criticism, was, already, an, established, practice, in, scholarly, circles, what, stanton, did, that, was, new, was, to, scrutinize, the, bible, from, a, woman, s, point, of, view, basing, her, findings, on, the, proposition, that, much, of, its, text, reflected, not, the, word, of, god, but, prejudice, against, women, during, a, less, civilized, age, in, her, book, stanton, explicitly, denied, much, of, what, was, central, to, traditional, christianity, saying, i, do, not, believe, that, any, man, ever, saw, or, talked, with, god, i, do, not, believe, that, god, inspired, the, mosaic, code, or, told, the, historians, what, they, say, he, did, about, woman, for, all, the, religions, on, the, face, of, the, earth, degrade, her, and, so, long, as, woman, accepts, the, position, that, they, assign, her, her, emancipation, is, impossible, in, the, book, s, closing, words, stanton, expressed, the, hope, for, reconstructing, a, more, rational, religion, for, the, nineteenth, century, and, thus, escape, all, the, perplexities, of, the, jewish, mythology, as, of, no, more, importance, than, those, of, the, greek, persian, and, egyptian, at, the, 1896, nawsa, convention, rachel, foster, avery, a, rising, young, leader, harshly, attacked, the, woman, s, bible, calling, it, a, volume, with, a, pretentious, title, without, either, scholarship, or, literary, merit, avery, introduced, a, resolution, to, distance, the, organization, from, stanton, s, book, despite, anthony, s, strong, objection, that, such, a, move, was, unnecessary, and, hurtful, the, resolution, passed, by, a, vote, of, 53, to, 41, stanton, told, anthony, that, she, should, resign, from, her, leadership, post, in, protest, but, anthony, refused, stanton, afterward, grew, increasingly, alienated, from, the, suffrage, movement, the, incident, led, many, of, the, younger, suffrage, leaders, to, hold, stanton, in, low, regard, for, the, rest, of, her, life, when, stanton, returned, from, her, final, trip, to, europe, in, 1891, she, moved, in, with, two, of, her, unmarried, children, who, shared, a, home, in, new, york, city, she, increased, her, advocacy, of, educated, suffrage, something, she, had, long, promoted, in, 1894, she, debated, william, lloyd, garrison, jr, on, this, issue, in, the, pages, of, woman, s, journal, her, daughter, harriot, stanton, blatch, who, was, then, active, in, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, in, britain, and, would, later, be, a, leading, figure, in, the, u, s, movement, was, disturbed, by, the, views, that, stanton, expressed, during, this, debate, she, published, a, critique, of, her, mother, s, views, saying, there, were, many, people, who, had, not, enjoyed, the, opportunity, to, acquire, an, education, and, yet, were, intelligent, and, accomplished, citizens, who, deserved, the, right, to, vote, in, a, letter, to, the, 1902, nawsa, convention, stanton, continued, her, campaign, calling, for, a, constitutional, amendment, requiring, an, educational, qualification, and, saying, that, everyone, who, votes, should, read, and, write, the, english, language, intelligently, i, am, opposed, to, the, domination, of, one, sex, over, the, other, it, cultivates, arrogance, in, the, one, and, destroys, the, self, respect, in, the, other, i, am, opposed, to, the, admission, of, another, man, either, foreign, or, native, to, the, polling, booth, until, woman, the, greatest, factor, in, civilization, is, first, enfranchised, an, aristocracy, of, men, composed, of, all, types, shades, and, degrees, of, intelligence, and, ignorance, is, not, the, most, desirable, substratum, for, government, to, subject, intelligent, highly, educated, virtuous, honorable, women, to, the, behests, of, such, an, aristocracy, is, the, height, of, cruelty, and, injustice, elizabeth, cady, stanton, advocating, educated, suffrage, in, her, later, years, stanton, became, interested, in, efforts, to, create, cooperative, communities, and, workplaces, she, was, also, attracted, to, various, forms, of, political, radicalism, applauding, the, populist, movement, and, identifying, herself, with, socialism, especially, fabianism, a, gradualist, form, of, democratic, socialism, in, 1898, stanton, published, her, memoirs, eighty, years, and, more, in, which, she, presented, the, image, of, herself, by, which, she, wished, to, be, remembered, in, it, she, minimized, political, and, personal, conflicts, and, omitted, any, discussion, of, the, split, in, the, women, s, movement, largely, dealing, with, political, topics, the, memoir, barely, mentions, her, mother, husband, or, children, despite, some, degree, of, friction, between, stanton, and, anthony, in, their, later, years, on, the, dedication, page, stanton, said, i, dedicate, this, volume, to, susan, b, anthony, my, steadfast, friend, for, half, a, century, stanton, continued, to, write, articles, prolifically, for, a, variety, of, publications, right, up, until, she, died, stanton, died, in, new, york, city, on, october, 26, 1902, 18, years, before, women, achieved, the, right, to, vote, in, the, united, states, via, the, nineteenth, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, the, medical, report, said, the, cause, of, death, was, heart, failure, according, to, her, daughter, harriet, she, had, developed, breathing, problems, that, had, begun, to, interfere, with, her, work, the, day, before, she, died, stanton, told, her, doctor, a, woman, to, give, her, something, to, speed, her, death, if, the, problem, could, not, be, cured, stanton, had, signed, a, document, two, years, earlier, directing, that, her, brain, was, to, be, donated, to, cornell, university, for, scientific, study, after, her, death, but, her, wishes, in, that, regard, were, not, carried, out, she, was, interred, beside, her, husband, in, woodlawn, cemetery, in, the, bronx, new, york, city, after, stanton, s, death, susan, b, anthony, wrote, to, a, friend, oh, this, awful, hush, it, seems, impossible, that, voice, is, stilled, which, i, have, loved, to, hear, for, fifty, years, always, i, have, felt, i, must, have, mrs, stanton, s, opinion, of, things, before, i, knew, where, i, stood, myself, i, am, all, at, sea, even, after, her, death, foes, of, women, s, suffrage, continued, to, use, stanton, s, more, unorthodox, statements, to, promote, opposition, to, ratification, of, the, nineteenth, amendment, which, became, law, in, 1920, younger, women, in, the, suffrage, movement, responded, by, belittling, stanton, and, glorifying, anthony, in, 1923, alice, paul, leader, of, the, national, women, s, party, introduced, the, proposed, equal, rights, amendment, in, seneca, falls, on, the, 75th, anniversary, of, the, seneca, falls, convention, the, planned, ceremony, and, printed, program, made, no, mention, of, stanton, the, primary, force, behind, the, convention, one, of, the, speakers, was, stanton, s, daughter, harriot, stanton, blatch, who, insisted, on, paying, tribute, to, her, mother, s, role, aside, from, a, collection, of, her, letters, published, by, her, children, no, significant, book, about, stanton, was, written, until, a, full, length, biography, was, published, in, 1940, with, the, assistance, of, her, daughter, stanton, began, to, regain, recognition, for, her, role, in, the, women, s, rights, movement, with, the, rise, of, the, new, feminist, movement, in, the, 1960s, and, the, establishment, of, academic, women, s, history, programs, stanton, is, commemorated, along, with, lucretia, mott, and, susan, b, anthony, in, the, 1921, sculpture, portrait, monument, by, adelaide, johnson, in, the, united, states, capitol, placed, for, years, in, the, crypt, of, the,
