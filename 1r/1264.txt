of, existence, in, what, became, known, as, the, deluge, the, russians, unopposed, quickly, appropriated, nearly, everything, that, was, not, already, occupied, by, the, swedes, when, the, poles, offered, to, negotiate, the, whole, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, was, the, least, of, the, demands, made, by, alexis, however, alexis, and, the, king, of, sweden, quarrelled, over, the, apportionment, of, the, spoils, and, at, the, end, of, may, 1656, with, encouragement, by, the, habsburg, emperor, and, the, other, enemies, of, sweden, alexis, declared, war, on, sweden, great, things, were, expected, by, russia, of, the, swedish, war, but, nothing, came, of, it, dorpat, was, taken, but, countless, multitudes, of, men, were, lost, in, vain, before, riga, in, the, meantime, poland, had, so, far, recovered, herself, as, to, become, a, much, more, dangerous, foe, than, sweden, and, as, it, was, impossible, to, wage, war, with, both, simultaneously, the, tsar, resolved, to, rid, himself, of, the, swedes, first, in, the, peace, of, kardis, 2, july, 1661, russia, retroceded, all, her, conquests, the, polish, war, dragged, on, for, six, years, longer, and, was, then, concluded,

restored, to, poland, but, the, more, important, cities, of, smolensk, and, kiev, remained, in, the, hands, of, russia, together, with, the, whole, eastern, bank, of, the, dnieper, river, this, truce, was, the, achievement, of, afanasy, ordin, nashchokin, the, first, russian, chancellor, and, diplomat, in, the, modern, sense, who, after, the, disgrace, of, nikon, became, the, tsar, s, first, minister, until, 1670, when, he, was, superseded, by, the, equally, able, artamon, matveyev, whose, beneficent, influence, prevailed, to, the, end, of, alexis, s, reign, when, charles, i, of, england, was, beheaded, by, the, parliamentarians, under, oliver, cromwell, in, 1649, an, outraged, alexis, broke, off, diplomatic, relations, with, england, and, accepted, royalist, refugees, in, moscow, he, also, banned, all, english, merchants, from, his, country, notably, members, of, the, muscovy, company, and, provided, financial, assistance, to, the, disconsolate, widow, of, that, glorious, martyr, king, charles, i, in, 1653, patriarch, nikon, established, a, series, of, reforms, that, aimed, to, bring, the, practices, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, into, line, with, its, greek, counterpart, most, notably, the, church, began, to, mandate, the, use, of, three, fingers, instead, of, two, in, making, the, sign, of, the, cross, this, resulted, in, significant, dissent, among, the, church, community, nevertheless, alexis, continued, to, support, nikon, until, 1658, when, nikon, abandoned, his, post, due, to, a, personal, insult, leaving, the, seat, of, the, patriarch, vacant, in, 1666, the, tsar, convened, the, great, moscow, synod, which, was, attended, by, patriarch, macarius, iii, ibn, al, za, im, and, patriarch, paisius, of, alexandria, in, order, to, address, the, problems, caused, by, nikon, the, synod, agreed, to, formally, depose, nikon, and, also, decided, to, excommunicate, all, who, opposed, the, reforms, of, the, church, those, opponents, broke, away, from, the, official, russian, orthodox, church, to, form, the, old, believers, movement, across, russia, old, believers, were, harshly, persecuted, one, such, old, believer, was, avvakum, the, leader, of, the, old, believers, avvakum, had, his, wife, and, children, buried, alive, in, front, of, him, he, himself, was, just, exiled, several, old, believers, fled, to, the, monastery, of, solovki, which, had, revolted, in, the, solovetsky, monastery, uprising, the, monastery, would, be, besieged, for, seven, years, until, 22, january, 1676, which, was, a, few, days, before, alexis, s, death, on, 8, february, 1676, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, it, is, the, crowning, merit, of, the, tsar, alexei, that, he, discovered, so, many, great, men, like, fyodor, rtishchev, ordin, matveyev, the, best, of, peter, s, precursors, and, suitably, employed, them, he, was, not, a, man, of, superior, strength, of, character, or, he, would, never, have, submitted, to, the, dictation, of, nikon, but, on, the, other, hand, he, was, naturally, if, timorously, progressive, or, he, would, never, have, encouraged, the, great, reforming, boyar, matveyev, his, last, years, notwithstanding, the, terrible, rebellion, of, stenka, razin, were, deservedly, tranquil, alexis, s, letters, were, first, published, by, pyotr, bartenev, in, 1856, they, have, earned, him, a, place, in, the, history, of, russian, literature, as, assessed, by, d, s, mirsky, a, few, private, letters, and, an, instruction, to, his, falconers, is, all, we, have, of, him, but, it, is, sufficient, for, sergey, platonov, to, proclaim, him, the, most, attractive, of, russian, monarchs, he, acquired, the, moniker, tishayshy, which, means, most, quiet, or, most, peaceful, he, received, this, moniker, through, the, ways, he, behaved, he, would, be, kind, and, friendly, but, the, sounds, created, from, instruments, would, provoke, him, certain, aspects, of, russian, orthodoxy, not, its, most, purely, spiritual, but, its, aesthetic, and, worldly, aspects, found, in, him, their, most, complete, expression, the, essence, of, alexis, s, personality, is, a, certain, spiritual, epicureanism, manifested, in, an, optimistic, christian, faith, in, a, profound, but, unfanatical, attachment, to, the, traditions, and, ritual, of, the, church, in, a, desire, to, see, everyone, round, him, happy, and, at, peace, and, in, a, highly, developed, capacity, to, extract, a, quiet, and, mellow, enjoyment, from, all, things, in, 1666, his, doctor, samuel, collins, described, alexis, then, aged, 37, as, having, a, sanguine, complexion, with, light, brown, hair, his, beard, uncut, he, is, tall, and, fat, of, a, majestical, deportment, severe, in, his, anger, bountiful, charitable, the, full, title, of, alexis, in, 1667, was, by, the, grace, of, god, we, the, great, sovereign, tsar, and, grand, prince, alexei, mikhailovich, autocrat, of, all, great,
