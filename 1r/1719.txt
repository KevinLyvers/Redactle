james, dewey, watson, born, april, 6, 1928, is, an, american, molecular, biologist, geneticist, and, zoologist, in, 1953, he, co, authored, with, francis, crick, the, academic, paper, proposing, the, double, helix, structure, of, the, dna, molecule, watson, crick, and, maurice, wilkins, were, awarded, the, 1962, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discoveries, concerning, the, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, and, its, significance, for, information, transfer, in, living, material, watson, earned, degrees, at, the, university, of, chicago, bs, 1947, and, indiana, university, phd, 1950, following, a, post, doctoral, year, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, with, herman, kalckar, and, ole, maal, e, watson, worked, at, the, university, of, cambridge, s, cavendish, laboratory, in, england, where, he, first, met, his, future, collaborator, francis, crick, from, 1956, to, 1976, watson, was, on, the, faculty, of, the, harvard, university, biology, department, promoting, research, in, molecular, biology, from, 1968, watson, served, as, director, of, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, cshl, greatly, expanding, its, level, of, funding, and, research, at, cshl, he, shifted, his, research, emphasis, to, the, study, of, cancer, along, with, making, it, a, world, leading, research, center, in, molecular, biology, in, 1994, he, started, as, president, and, served, for, 10, years, he, was, then, appointed, chancellor, serving, until, he, resigned, in, 2007, after, making, comments, claiming, that, there, is, a, genetic, link, between, intelligence, and, race, in, 2019, following, the, broadcast, of, a, documentary, in, which, watson, reiterated, these, views, on, race, and, genetics, cshl, revoked, his, honorary, titles, and, severed, all, ties, with, him, watson, has, written, many, science, books, including, the, textbook, molecular, biology, of, the, gene, 1965, and, his, bestselling, book, the, double, helix, 1968, between, 1988, and, 1992, watson, was, associated, with, the, national, institutes, of, health, helping, to, establish, the, human, genome, project, which, completed, the, task, of, mapping, the, human, genome, in, 2003, watson, was, born, in, chicago, on, april, 6, 1928, as, the, only, son, of, jean, n, e, mitchell, and, james, d, watson, a, businessman, descended, mostly, from, colonial, english, immigrants, to, america, his, mother, s, father, lauchlin, mitchell, a, tailor, was, from, glasgow, scotland, and, her, mother, lizzie, gleason, was, the, child, of, parents, from, county, tipperary, ireland, his, mother, was, a, modestly, religious, catholic, and, his, father, an, episcopalian, who, had, lost, his, belief, in, god, watson, was, raised, catholic, but, he, later, described, himself, as, an, escapee, from, the, catholic, religion, watson, said, the, luckiest, thing, that, ever, happened, to, me, was, that, my, father, didn, t, believe, in, god, by, age, 11, watson, stopped, attending, mass, and, embraced, the, pursuit, of, scientific, and, humanistic, knowledge, watson, grew, up, on, the, south, side, of, chicago, and, attended, public, schools, including, horace, mann, elementary, school, and, south, shore, high, school, he, was, fascinated, with, bird, watching, a, hobby, shared, with, his, father, so, he, considered, majoring, in, ornithology, watson, appeared, on, quiz, kids, a, popular, radio, show, that, challenged, bright, youngsters, to, answer, questions, thanks, to, the, liberal, policy, of, university, president, robert, hutchins, he, enrolled, at, the, university, of, chicago, where, he, was, awarded, a, tuition, scholarship, at, the, age, of, 15, among, his, professors, was, louis, leon, thurstone, from, whom, watson, learned, about, factor, analysis, which, he, would, later, reference, on, his, controversial, views, on, race, after, reading, erwin, schr, dinger, s, book, what, is, life, in, 1946, watson, changed, his, professional, ambitions, from, the, study, of, ornithology, to, genetics, watson, earned, his, bs, degree, in, zoology, from, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1947, in, his, autobiography, avoid, boring, people, watson, described, the, university, of, chicago, as, an, idyllic, academic, institution, where, he, was, instilled, with, the, capacity, for, critical, thought, and, an, ethical, compulsion, not, to, suffer, fools, who, impeded, his, search, for, truth, in, contrast, to, his, description, of, later, experiences, in, 1947, watson, left, the, university, of, chicago, to, become, a, graduate, student, at, indiana, university, attracted, by, the, presence, at, bloomington, of, the, 1946, nobel, prize, winner, hermann, joseph, muller, who, in, crucial, papers, published, in, 1922, 1929, and, in, the, 1930s, had, laid, out, all, the, basic, properties, of, the, heredity, molecule, that, schr, dinger, presented, in, his, 1944, book, he, received, his, phd, degree, from, indiana, university, in, 1950, salvador, luria, was, his, doctoral, advisor, originally, watson, was, drawn, into, molecular, biology, by, the, work, of, salvador, luria, luria, eventually, shared, the, 1969, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, work, on, the, luria, delbr, ck, experiment, which, concerned, the, nature, of, genetic, mutations, he, was, part, of, a, distributed, group, of, researchers, who, were, making, use, of, the, viruses, that, infect, bacteria, called, bacteriophages, he, and, max, delbr, ck, were, among, the, leaders, of, this, new, phage, group, an, important, movement, of, geneticists, from, experimental, systems, such, as, drosophila, towards, microbial, genetics, early, in, 1948, watson, began, his, phd, research, in, luria, s, laboratory, at, indiana, university, that, spring, he, met, delbr, ck, first, in, luria, s, apartment, and, again, that, summer, during, watson, s, first, trip, to, the, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, cshl, the, phage, group, was, the, intellectual, medium, where, watson, became, a, working, scientist, importantly, the, members, of, the, phage, group, sensed, that, they, were, on, the, path, to, discovering, the, physical, nature, of, the, gene, in, 1949, watson, took, a, course, with, felix, haurowitz, that, included, the, conventional, view, of, that, time, that, genes, were, proteins, and, able, to, replicate, themselves, the, other, major, molecular, component, of, chromosomes, dna, was, widely, considered, to, be, a, stupid, tetranucleotide, serving, only, a, structural, role, to, support, the, proteins, even, at, this, early, time, watson, under, the, influence, of, the, phage, group, was, aware, of, the, avery, macleod, mccarty, experiment, which, suggested, that, dna, was, the, genetic, molecule, watson, s, research, project, involved, using, x, rays, to, inactivate, bacterial, viruses, watson, then, went, to, copenhagen, university, in, september, 1950, for, a, year, of, postdoctoral, research, first, heading, to, the, laboratory, of, biochemist, herman, kalckar, kalckar, was, interested, in, the, enzymatic, synthesis, of, nucleic, acids, and, he, wanted, to, use, phages, as, an, experimental, system, watson, wanted, to, explore, the, structure, of, dna, and, his, interests, did, not, coincide, with, kalckar, s, after, working, part, of, the, year, with, kalckar, watson, spent, the, remainder, of, his, time, in, copenhagen, conducting, experiments, with, microbial, physiologist, ole, maal, e, then, a, member, of, the, phage, group, the, experiments, which, watson, had, learned, of, during, the, previous, summer, s, cold, spring, harbor, phage, conference, included, the, use, of, radioactive, phosphate, as, a, tracer, to, determine, which, molecular, components, of, phage, particles, actually, infect, the, target, bacteria, during, viral, infection, the, intention, was, to, determine, whether, protein, or, dna, was, the, genetic, material, but, upon, consultation, with, max, delbr, ck, they, determined, that, their, results, were, inconclusive, and, could, not, specifically, identify, the, newly, labeled, molecules, as, dna, watson, never, developed, a, constructive, interaction, with, kalckar, but, he, did, accompany, kalckar, to, a, meeting, in, italy, where, watson, saw, maurice, wilkins, talk, about, x, ray, diffraction, data, for, dna, watson, was, now, certain, that, dna, had, a, definite, molecular, structure, that, could, be, elucidated, in, 1951, the, chemist, linus, pauling, in, california, published, his, model, of, the, amino, acid, alpha, helix, a, result, that, grew, out, of, pauling, s, efforts, in, x, ray, crystallography, and, molecular, model, building, after, obtaining, some, results, from, his, phage, and, other, experimental, research, conducted, at, indiana, university, statens, serum, institut, denmark, cshl, and, the, california, institute, of, technology, watson, now, had, the, desire, to, learn, to, perform, x, ray, diffraction, experiments, so, he, could, work, to, determine, the, structure, of, dna, that, summer, luria, met, john, kendrew, and, he, arranged, for, a, new, postdoctoral, research, project, for, watson, in, england, in, 1951, watson, visited, the, stazione, zoologica, anton, dohrn, in, naples, in, mid, march, 1953, watson, and, crick, deduced, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, crucial, to, their, discovery, were, the, experimental, data, collected, at, king, s, college, london, mainly, by, rosalind, franklin, for, which, they, did, not, provide, proper, attribution, sir, lawrence, bragg, the, director, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, where, watson, and, crick, worked, made, the, original, announcement, of, the, discovery, at, a, solvay, conference, on, proteins, in, belgium, on, april, 8, 1953, it, went, unreported, by, the, press, watson, and, crick, submitted, a, paper, entitled, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, a, structure, for, deoxyribose, nucleic, acid, to, the, scientific, journal, nature, which, was, published, on, april, 25, 1953, bragg, gave, a, talk, at, the, guy, s, hospital, medical, school, in, london, on, thursday, may, 14, 1953, which, resulted, in, a, may, 15, 1953, article, by, ritchie, calder, in, the, london, newspaper, news, chronicle, entitled, why, you, are, you, nearer, secret, of, life, sydney, brenner, jack, dunitz, dorothy, hodgkin, leslie, orgel, and, beryl, m, oughton, were, some, of, the, first, people, in, april, 1953, to, see, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, constructed, by, crick, and, watson, at, the, time, they, were, working, at, oxford, university, s, chemistry, department, all, were, impressed, by, the, new, dna, model, especially, brenner, who, subsequently, worked, with, crick, at, cambridge, in, the, cavendish, laboratory, and, the, new, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, according, to, the, late, beryl, oughton, later, rimmer, they, all, travelled, together, in, two, cars, once, dorothy, hodgkin, announced, to, them, that, they, were, off, to, cambridge, to, see, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, the, cambridge, university, student, newspaper, varsity, ran, its, own, short, article, on, the, discovery, on, saturday, may, 30, 1953, watson, subsequently, presented, a, paper, on, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, at, the, 18th, cold, spring, harbor, symposium, on, viruses, in, early, june, 1953, six, weeks, after, the, publication, of, the, watson, and, crick, paper, in, nature, many, at, the, meeting, had, not, yet, heard, of, the, discovery, the, 1953, cold, spring, harbor, symposium, was, the, first, opportunity, for, many, to, see, the, model, of, the, dna, double, helix, watson, crick, and, wilkins, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1962, for, their, research, on, the, structure, of, nucleic, acids, rosalind, franklin, had, died, in, 1958, and, was, therefore, ineligible, for, nomination, the, publication, of, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, has, been, described, as, a, turning, point, in, science, understanding, of, life, was, fundamentally, changed, and, the, modern, era, of, biology, began, watson, and, crick, s, use, of, dna, x, ray, diffraction, data, collected, by, rosalind, franklin, and, her, student, raymond, gosling, has, attracted, scrutiny, it, has, been, argued, that, watson, and, his, colleagues, did, not, properly, acknowledge, colleague, rosalind, franklin, for, her, contributions, to, the, discovery, of, the, double, helix, structure, robert, p, crease, notes, that, such, stingy, behaviour, may, not, be, unknown, or, even, uncommon, among, scientists, franklin, s, high, quality, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, of, dna, were, unpublished, results, which, watson, and, crick, used, without, her, knowledge, or, consent, in, their, construction, of, the, double, helix, model, of, dna, franklin, s, results, provided, estimates, of, the, water, content, of, dna, crystals, and, these, results, were, consistent, with, the, two, sugar, phosphate, backbones, being, on, the, outside, of, the, molecule, franklin, told, crick, and, watson, that, the, backbones, had, to, be, on, the, outside, before, then, linus, pauling, and, watson, and, crick, had, erroneous, models, with, the, chains, inside, and, the, bases, pointing, outwards, her, identification, of, the, space, group, for, dna, crystals, revealed, to, crick, that, the, two, dna, strands, were, antiparallel, the, x, ray, diffraction, images, collected, by, gosling, and, franklin, provided, the, best, evidence, for, the, helical, nature, of, dna, watson, and, crick, had, three, sources, for, franklin, s, unpublished, data, in, a, 1954, article, watson, and, crick, acknowledged, that, without, franklin, s, data, the, formulation, of, our, structure, would, have, been, most, unlikely, if, not, impossible, in, the, double, helix, watson, later, admitted, that, rosy, of, course, did, not, directly, give, us, her, data, for, that, matter, no, one, at, king, s, realized, they, were, in, our, hands, in, recent, years, watson, has, garnered, controversy, in, the, popular, and, scientific, press, for, his, misogynist, treatment, of, franklin, and, his, failure, to, properly, attribute, her, work, on, dna, according, to, one, critic, watson, s, portrayal, of, franklin, in, the, double, helix, was, negative, giving, the, impression, that, she, was, wilkins, assistant, and, was, unable, to, interpret, her, own, dna, data, watson, s, accusation, was, indefensible, since, franklin, told, crick, and, watson, that, the, helix, backbones, had, to, be, on, the, outside, from, a, 2003, piece, by, brenda, maddox, in, nature, other, comments, dismissive, of, rosy, in, watson, s, book, caught, the, attention, of, the, emerging, women, s, movement, in, the, late, 1960s, clearly, rosy, had, to, go, or, be, put, in, her, place, unfortunately, maurice, could, not, see, any, decent, way, to, give, rosy, the, boot, and, certainly, a, bad, way, to, go, out, into, the, foulness, of, a, november, night, was, to, be, told, by, a, woman, to, refrain, from, venturing, an, opinion, about, a, subject, for, which, you, were, not, trained, robert, p, crease, remarks, that, was, close, to, figuring, out, the, structure, of, dna, but, did, not, do, it, the, title, of, discoverer, goes, to, those, who, first, fit, the, pieces, together, jeremy, bernstein, rejects, that, franklin, was, a, victim, and, states, that, made, the, double, helix, scheme, work, it, is, as, simple, as, that, matthew, cobb, and, nathaniel, c, comfort, write, that, franklin, was, no, victim, in, how, the, dna, double, helix, was, solved, but, that, she, was, an, equal, contributor, to, the, solution, of, the, structure, a, review, of, the, correspondence, from, franklin, to, watson, in, the, archives, at, cshl, revealed, that, the, two, scientists, later, exchanged, constructive, scientific, correspondence, franklin, consulted, with, watson, on, her, tobacco, mosaic, virus, rna, research, franklin, s, letters, were, framed, with, the, normal, and, unremarkable, forms, of, address, beginning, with, dear, jim, and, concluding, with, best, wishes, yours, rosalind, each, of, the, scientists, published, their, own, unique, contributions, to, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, in, separate, articles, and, all, of, the, contributors, published, their, findings, in, the, same, volume, of, nature, these, classic, molecular, biology, papers, are, identified, as, watson, j, d, and, crick, f, h, c, a, structure, for, deoxyribose, nucleic, acid, nature, 171, 737, 738, 1953, wilkins, m, h, f, stokes, a, r, wilson, h, r, molecular, structure, of, deoxypentose, nucleic, acids, nature, 171, 738, 740, 1953, franklin, r, and, gosling, r, g, molecular, configuration, in, sodium, thymonucleate, nature, 171, 740, 741, 1953, in, 1956, watson, accepted, a, position, in, the, biology, department, at, harvard, university, his, work, at, harvard, focused, on, rna, and, its, role, in, the, transfer, of, genetic, information, watson, championed, a, switch, in, focus, for, the, school, from, classical, biology, to, molecular, biology, stating, that, disciplines, such, as, ecology, developmental, biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc, had, stagnated, and, could, progress, only, once, the, underlying, disciplines, of, molecular, biology, and, biochemistry, had, elucidated, their, underpinnings, going, so, far, as, to, discourage, their, study, by, students, watson, continued, to, be, a, member, of, the, harvard, faculty, until, 1976, even, though, he, took, over, the, directorship, of, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, in, 1968, during, his, tenure, at, harvard, watson, participated, in, a, protest, against, the, vietnam, war, leading, a, group, of, 12, biologists, and, biochemists, calling, for, the, immediate, withdrawal, of, u, s, forces, from, vietnam, in, 1975, on, the, thirtieth, anniversary, of, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, watson, was, one, of, over, 2000, scientists, and, engineers, who, spoke, out, against, nuclear, proliferation, to, president, gerald, ford, arguing, that, there, was, no, proven, method, for, the, safe, disposal, of, radioactive, waste, and, that, nuclear, plants, were, a, security, threat, due, to, the, possibility, of, terrorist, theft, of, plutonium, watson, s, first, textbook, the, molecular, biology, of, the, gene, used, the, concept, of, heads, brief, declarative, subheadings, his, next, textbook, was, molecular, biology, of, the, cell, in, which, he, coordinated, the, work, of, a, group, of, scientist, writers, his, third, was, recombinant, dna, which, described, the, ways, in, which, genetic, engineering, has, brought, new, information, about, how, organisms, function, in, 1968, watson, wrote, the, double, helix, listed, by, the, board, of, the, modern, library, as, number, seven, in, their, list, of, 100, best, nonfiction, books, the, book, details, the, story, of, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, as, well, as, the, personalities, conflicts, and, controversy, surrounding, their, work, and, includes, many, of, his, private, emotional, impressions, at, the, time, watson, s, original, title, was, to, have, been, honest, jim, controversy, surrounded, the, publication, of, the, book, watson, s, book, was, originally, to, be, published, by, the, harvard, university, press, but, francis, crick, and, maurice, wilkins, among, others, objected, watson, s, home, university, dropped, the, project, and, the, book, was, commercially, published, in, an, interview, with, anne, sayre, for, her, book, rosalind, franklin, and, dna, published, in, 1975, and, reissued, in, 2000, francis, crick, said, that, he, regarded, watson, s, book, as, a, contemptible, pack, of, damned, nonsense, in, 1968, watson, became, the, director, of, the, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, cshl, between, 1970, and, 1972, the, watsons, two, sons, were, born, and, by, 1974, the, young, family, made, cold, spring, harbor, their, permanent, residence, watson, served, as, the, laboratory, s, director, and, president, for, about, 35, years, and, later, he, assumed, the, role, of, chancellor, and, then, chancellor, emeritus, in, his, roles, as, director, president, and, chancellor, watson, led, cshl, to, articulate, its, present, day, mission, dedication, to, exploring, molecular, biology, and, genetics, in, order, to, advance, the, understanding, and, ability, to, diagnose, and, treat, cancers, neurological, diseases, and, other, causes, of, human, suffering, cshl, substantially, expanded, both, its, research, and, its, science, educational, programs, under, watson, s, direction, he, is, credited, with, transforming, a, small, facility, into, one, of, the, world, s, great, education, and, research, institutions, initiating, a, program, to, study, the, cause, of, human, cancer, scientists, under, his, direction, have, made, major, contributions, to, understanding, the, genetic, basis, of, cancer, in, a, retrospective, summary, of, watson, s, accomplishments, there, bruce, stillman, the, laboratory, s, president, said, jim, watson, created, a, research, environment, that, is, unparalleled, in, the, world, of, science, in, 2007, watson, said, i, turned, against, the, left, wing, because, they, don, t, like, genetics, because, genetics, implies, that, sometimes, in, life, we, fail, because, we, have, bad, genes, they, want, all, failure, in, life, to, be, due, to, the, evil, system, in, 1990, watson, was, appointed, as, the, head, of, the, human, genome, project, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, a, position, he, held, until, april, 10, 1992, watson, left, the, genome, project, after, conflicts, with, the, new, nih, director, bernadine, healy, watson, was, opposed, to, healy, s, attempts, to, acquire, patents, on, gene, sequences, and, any, ownership, of, the, laws, of, nature, two, years, before, stepping, down, from, the, genome, project, he, had, stated, his, own, opinion, on, this, long, and, ongoing, controversy, which, he, saw, as, an, illogical, barrier, to, research, he, said, the, nations, of, the, world, must, see, that, the, human, genome, belongs, to, the, world, s, people, as, opposed, to, its, nations, he, left, within, weeks, of, the, 1992, announcement, that, the, nih, would, be, applying, for, patents, on, brain, specific, cdnas, the, issue, of, the, patentability, of, genes, has, since, been, resolved, in, the, us, by, the, us, supreme, court, see, association, for, molecular, pathology, v, u, s, patent, and, trademark, office, in, 1994, watson, became, president, of, cshl, francis, collins, took, over, the, role, as, director, of, the, human, genome, project, watson, was, quoted, in, the, sunday, telegraph, in, 1997, as, stating, if, you, could, find, the, gene, which, determines, sexuality, and, a, woman, decides, she, doesn, t, want, a, homosexual, child, well, let, her, the, biologist, richard, dawkins, wrote, a, letter, to, the, independent, claiming, that, watson, s, position, was, misrepresented, by, the, sunday, telegraph, article, and, that, watson, would, equally, consider, the, possibility, of, having, a, heterosexual, child, to, be, just, as, valid, as, any, other, reason, for, abortion, to, emphasise, that, watson, is, in, favor, of, allowing, choice, on, the, issue, of, obesity, watson, was, quoted, in, 2000, saying, whenever, you, interview, fat, people, you, feel, bad, because, you, know, you, re, not, going, to, hire, them, watson, has, repeatedly, supported, genetic, screening, and, genetic, engineering, in, public, lectures, and, interviews, arguing, that, stupidity, is, a, disease, and, the, really, stupid, bottom, 10, of, people, should, be, cured, he, has, also, suggested, that, beauty, could, be, genetically, engineered, saying, in, 2003, people, say, it, would, be, terrible, if, we, made, all, girls, pretty, i, think, it, would, be, great, in, 2007, watson, became, the, second, person, to, publish, his, fully, sequenced, genome, online, after, it, was, presented, to, him, on, may, 31, 2007, by, 454, life, sciences, corporation, in, collaboration, with, scientists, at, the, human, genome, sequencing, center, baylor, college, of, medicine, watson, was, quoted, as, saying, i, am, putting, my, genome, sequence, on, line, to, encourage, the, development, of, an, era, of, personalized, medicine, in, which, information, contained, in, our, genomes, can, be, used, to, identify, and, prevent, disease, and, to, create, individualized, medical, therapies, in, 2014, watson, published, a, paper, in, the, lancet, suggesting, that, biological, oxidants, may, have, a, different, role, than, is, thought, in, diseases,
