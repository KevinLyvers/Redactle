nicolas, poussin, uk, p, u, s, us, p, u, s, french, june, 1594, 19, november, 1665, was, a, french, painter, who, was, a, leading, painter, of, the, classical, french, baroque, style, although, he, spent, most, of, his, working, life, in, rome, most, of, his, works, were, on, religious, and, mythological, subjects, painted, for, a, small, group, of, italian, and, french, collectors, he, returned, to, paris, for, a, brief, period, to, serve, as, first, painter, to, the, king, under, louis, xiii, and, cardinal, richelieu, but, soon, returned, to, rome, and, resumed, his, more, traditional, themes, in, his, later, years, he, gave, growing, prominence, to, the, landscape, in, his, paintings, his, work, is, characterized, by, clarity, logic, and, order, and, favors, line, over, color, until, the, 20th, century, he, remained, a, major, inspiration, for, such, classically, oriented, artists, as, jacques, louis, david, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, and, paul, c, zanne, details, of, poussin, s, artistic, training, are, somewhat, obscure, around, 1612, he, traveled, to, paris, where, he, studied, under, minor, masters, and, completed, his, earliest, surviving, works, his, enthusiasm, for, the, italian, works, he, saw, in, the, royal, collections, in, paris, motivated, him, to, travel, to, rome, in, 1624, where, he, studied, the, works, of, renaissance, and, baroque, painters, especially, raphael, who, had, a, powerful, influence, on, his, style, he, befriended, a, number, of, artists, who, shared, his, classicizing, tendencies, and, met, important, patrons, such, as, cardinal, francesco, barberini, and, the, antiquarian, cassiano, dal, pozzo, the, commissions, poussin, received, for, modestly, scaled, paintings, of, religious, mythological, and, historical, subjects, allowed, him, to, develop, his, individual, style, in, works, such, as, the, death, of, germanicus, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, and, the, first, of, his, two, series, of, the, seven, sacraments, he, was, persuaded, to, return, to, france, in, 1640, to, be, first, painter, to, the, king, but, dissatisfied, with, the, overwhelming, workload, and, the, court, intrigues, returned, permanently, to, rome, after, a, little, more, than, a, year, among, the, important, works, from, his, later, years, are, orion, blinded, searching, for, the, sun, landscape, with, hercules, and, cacus, and, the, seasons, nicolas, poussin, s, early, biographer, was, his, friend, giovanni, pietro, bellori, who, relates, that, poussin, was, born, near, les, andelys, in, normandy, and, that, he, received, an, education, that, included, some, latin, which, would, stand, him, in, good, stead, another, early, friend, and, biographer, andr, f, libien, reported, that, he, was, busy, without, cease, filling, his, sketchbooks, with, an, infinite, number, of, different, figures, which, only, his, imagination, could, produce, his, early, sketches, attracted, the, notice, of, quentin, varin, who, passed, some, time, in, andelys, but, there, is, no, mention, by, his, biographers, that, he, had, a, formal, training, in, varin, s, studio, though, his, later, works, showed, the, influence, of, varin, particularly, by, their, storytelling, accuracy, of, facial, expression, finely, painted, drapery, and, rich, colors, his, parents, apparently, opposed, a, painting, career, for, him, and, in, or, around, 1612, at, the, age, of, eighteen, he, ran, away, to, paris, he, arrived, in, paris, during, the, regency, of, marie, de, medici, when, art, was, flourishing, as, a, result, of, the, royal, commissions, given, by, marie, de, medici, for, the, decoration, of, her, palace, and, by, the, rise, of, wealthy, paris, merchants, who, bought, art, there, was, also, a, substantial, market, for, paintings, in, the, redecoration, of, churches, outside, paris, destroyed, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, which, had, recently, ended, and, for, the, numerous, convents, in, paris, and, other, cities, however, poussin, was, not, a, member, of, the, powerful, guild, of, master, painters, and, sculptors, which, had, a, monopoly, on, most, art, commissions, and, brought, lawsuits, against, outsiders, like, poussin, who, tried, to, break, into, the, profession, his, early, sketches, gained, him, a, place, in, the, studios, of, established, painters, he, worked, for, three, months, in, the, studio, of, the, flemish, painter, ferdinand, elle, who, painted, almost, exclusively, portraits, a, genre, that, was, of, little, interest, to, poussin, afterward, he, is, thought, to, have, studied, for, one, month, in, the, studio, of, georges, lallemand, but, lallemand, s, inattention, to, precise, drawing, and, the, articulation, of, his, figures, apparently, displeased, poussin, moreover, poussin, did, not, fit, well, into, the, studio, system, in, which, several, painters, worked, on, the, same, painting, thereafter, he, preferred, to, work, very, slowly, and, alone, little, is, known, of, his, life, in, paris, at, this, time, court, records, show, that, he, ran, up, considerable, debts, which, he, was, unable, to, pay, he, studied, anatomy, and, perspective, but, the, most, important, event, of, his, first, residence, in, paris, was, his, discovery, of, the, royal, art, collections, thanks, to, his, friendship, with, alexandre, courtois, the, valet, de, chambre, of, marie, de, medicis, there, he, saw, for, the, first, time, engravings, of, the, works, of, giulio, romano, and, especially, of, raphael, whose, work, had, an, enormous, influence, on, his, future, style, he, first, tried, to, travel, to, rome, in, 1617, or, 1618, but, made, it, only, as, far, as, florence, where, as, his, biographer, bellori, reported, as, a, result, of, some, sort, of, accident, he, returned, to, france, on, his, return, he, began, making, paintings, for, paris, churches, and, convents, in, 1622, made, another, attempt, to, go, to, rome, but, went, only, as, far, as, lyon, before, returning, in, the, summer, of, the, same, year, he, received, his, first, important, commission, the, order, of, jesuits, requested, a, series, of, six, large, paintings, to, honor, the, canonization, of, their, founder, saint, francis, xavier, the, originality, and, energy, of, these, paintings, since, lost, brought, him, a, series, of, important, commissions, giambattista, marino, the, court, poet, to, marie, de, medici, employed, him, to, make, a, series, of, fifteen, drawings, eleven, illustrating, ovid, s, metamorphoses, and, four, illustrating, battle, scenes, from, roman, history, the, marino, drawings, now, at, windsor, castle, are, among, the, earliest, identifiable, works, of, poussin, marino, s, influence, led, to, a, commission, for, some, decoration, of, marie, de, medici, s, residence, the, luxembourg, palace, then, a, commission, from, the, first, archbishop, of, paris, jean, fran, ois, de, gondi, for, a, painting, of, the, death, of, the, virgin, since, lost, for, the, archbishop, s, family, chapel, at, the, cathedral, of, notre, dame, de, paris, marino, took, him, into, his, household, and, when, he, returned, to, rome, in, 1623, invited, poussin, to, join, him, poussin, remained, in, paris, to, finish, his, earlier, commissions, then, arrived, to, rome, in, the, spring, of, 1624, poussin, was, thirty, when, he, arrived, in, rome, in, 1624, the, new, pope, urban, viii, elected, in, 1623, was, determined, to, maintain, the, position, of, rome, as, the, artistic, capital, of, europe, and, artists, from, around, the, world, gathered, there, poussin, could, visit, the, churches, and, convents, to, study, the, works, of, raphael, and, other, renaissance, painters, as, well, as, the, more, recent, works, of, carracci, guido, reni, and, caravaggio, whose, work, poussin, detested, saying, that, caravaggio, was, born, to, destroy, painting, he, studied, the, art, of, painting, nudes, at, the, academy, of, domenichino, and, frequented, the, academy, of, saint, luke, which, brought, together, the, leading, painters, in, rome, and, whose, head, in, 1624, was, another, french, painter, simon, vouet, who, offered, lodging, to, poussin, poussin, became, acquainted, with, other, artists, in, rome, and, tended, to, befriend, those, with, classicizing, artistic, leanings, the, french, sculptor, fran, ois, duquesnoy, whom, he, lodged, with, in, 1626, in, via, dei, maroniti, the, french, artist, jacques, stella, claude, lorraine, domenichino, andrea, sacchi, and, joined, an, informal, academy, of, artists, and, patrons, opposed, to, the, current, baroque, style, that, formed, around, joachim, von, sandrart, rome, also, offered, poussin, a, flourishing, art, market, and, an, introduction, to, an, important, number, of, art, patrons, through, marino, he, was, introduced, to, cardinal, francesco, barberini, the, brother, of, the, new, pope, and, to, cassiano, dal, pozzo, the, cardinal, s, secretary, and, a, passionate, scholar, of, ancient, rome, and, greece, who, both, later, became, his, important, patrons, the, new, art, collectors, demanded, a, different, format, of, paintings, instead, of, large, altarpieces, and, decoration, for, palaces, they, wanted, smaller, size, religious, paintings, for, private, devotion, or, picturesque, landscapes, mythological, and, history, paintings, the, early, years, of, poussin, in, rome, were, difficult, his, patron, marino, departed, rome, for, naples, in, may, 1624, shortly, after, poussin, arrived, and, died, there, in, 1625, his, other, major, sponsor, cardinal, francesco, barberini, was, named, a, papal, legate, to, spain, and, also, departed, soon, afterwards, taking, cassiano, dal, pozzo, with, him, poussin, became, ill, with, syphilis, but, refused, to, go, to, the, hospital, where, the, care, was, extremely, poor, and, he, was, unable, to, paint, for, months, he, survived, by, selling, the, paintings, he, had, for, a, few, ecus, thanks, to, the, assistance, of, a, chef, jacques, dughet, whose, family, took, him, in, and, cared, for, him, he, largely, recovered, by, 1629, and, on, 1, september, 1630, he, married, anne, marie, dughet, the, daughter, of, dughet, his, two, brothers, in, law, were, artists, and, gaspard, dughet, later, took, poussin, s, surname, cardinal, barberini, and, cassiano, dal, pozzo, returned, to, rome, in, 1626, and, by, their, patronage, poussin, received, two, major, commissions, in, 1627, poussin, painted, the, death, of, germanicus, minneapolis, institute, of, arts, for, cardinal, barberini, the, painting, s, erudite, use, of, ancient, textual, and, visual, sources, the, histories, of, tacitus, and, the, meleager, sarcophagus, stoic, restraint, and, pictorial, clarity, established, poussin, s, reputation, as, a, major, artist, in, 1628, he, was, living, on, the, via, paolino, babuino, with, jean, le, maire, the, success, of, the, germanicus, led, to, an, even, more, prestigious, commission, in, 1628, for, an, altarpiece, depicting, the, martyrdom, of, st, erasmus, for, the, erasmus, chapel, in, the, basilica, of, st, peter, s, now, in, the, vatican, pinacoteca, the, fabricca, di, san, pietro, had, originally, awarded, the, commission, to, pietro, da, cortona, who, had, produced, only, preliminary, designs, for, the, altarpiece, when, he, was, unexpectedly, transferred, to, another, project, thanks, to, cassiano, dal, pozzo, s, influence, poussin, was, chosen, to, paint, the, saint, erasmus, altarpiece, following, pietro, da, cortona, s, original, design, with, its, plunging, diagonal, composition, and, high, narrative, drama, the, martyrdom, of, st, erasmus, is, poussin, s, most, overtly, baroque, work, despite, its, adherence, to, the, pictorial, idiom, of, the, day, for, unknown, reasons, the, martyrdom, of, st, erasmus, seems, to, have, met, with, official, displeasure, and, generated, no, further, papal, commissions, this, disappointment, and, the, loss, of, a, competition, for, a, fresco, cycle, in, san, luigi, dei, francesi, convinced, poussin, abandon, the, pursuit, of, large, scale, public, commissions, and, the, burdensome, competitions, content, restrictions, and, political, machinations, they, entailed, instead, poussin, would, re, orient, his, art, towards, private, collectors, for, whom, he, could, work, more, slowly, with, increasing, control, over, subject, matter, and, style, along, with, cardinal, barberini, and, cassiano, dal, pozzo, for, whom, he, painted, the, first, seven, sacraments, series, poussin, s, early, private, patrons, included, the, chanoine, gian, maria, roscioli, who, bought, the, young, pyrrhus, saved, and, several, other, important, works, cardinal, rospigliosi, for, whom, he, painted, the, second, version, of, the, shepherds, of, arcadia, and, cardinal, luigi, omodei, who, received, the, triumphs, of, flora, c, 1630, 32, louvre, he, painted, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, for, the, banker, vincenzo, giustiniani, the, jewel, thief, and, art, swindler, fabrizio, valguarnera, bought, plague, of, ashdod, and, commissioned, the, empire, of, flora, he, also, received, his, first, french, commissions, from, the, marechal, de, crequi, the, french, envoy, to, italy, later, from, cardinal, de, richelieu, for, a, series, of, bacchanales, buoyed, by, this, commercial, success, poussin, bought, a, life, interest, in, a, small, house, on, via, paolina, babuino, for, his, wife, and, himself, in, 1632, and, entered, his, most, productive, period, his, house, was, at, the, foot, of, trinit, des, monts, near, the, city, gate, where, other, foreigners, and, artists, lived, its, exact, location, is, not, known, but, it, was, opposite, the, church, of, sant, atanasio, dei, greci, as, the, work, of, poussin, became, well, known, in, rome, he, received, invitations, to, return, to, paris, for, important, royal, commissions, proposed, by, sublet, de, noyers, the, superintendent, of, buildings, for, louis, xiii, when, poussin, declined, noyers, sent, his, cousins, roland, fr, art, de, chambray, and, paul, fr, art, to, rome, to, persuade, poussin, to, come, home, offering, him, the, title, of, first, painter, to, the, king, plus, a, substantial, residence, at, the, tuileries, palace, poussin, yielded, and, in, december, 1640, he, was, back, in, paris, the, correspondence, of, poussin, to, cassiano, dal, pozzo, and, his, other, friends, in, rome, show, that, he, was, appreciative, of, the, money, and, honors, but, he, was, quickly, overwhelmed, by, a, large, number, of, commissions, particularly, since, he, had, taken, the, habit, of, working, slowly, and, carefully, his, new, projects, included, the, institution, of, the, eucharist, for, the, chapel, of, the, ch, teau, de, saint, germain, en, laye, and, the, miracle, of, saint, francis, xavier, for, the, altar, of, the, church, of, the, novitiate, of, the, jesuits, in, addition, he, was, asked, to, the, ceilings, and, vaults, for, the, grand, gallery, of, the, louvre, and, to, paint, a, large, allegorical, work, for, the, study, of, cardinal, richelieu, on, the, theme, time, defending, truth, from, the, attacks, of, envy, and, discord, with, the, figure, of, truth, clearly, standing, for, cardinal, richelieu, he, was, also, expected, to, provide, designs, for, royal, tapestries, and, the, front, pieces, for, books, from, the, royal, printing, house, he, was, also, subjected, to, considerable, criticism, from, the, partisans, of, other, french, painters, including, his, old, friend, simon, vouet, he, completed, a, painting, of, the, last, supper, now, in, the, louvre, eight, cartoons, for, the, gobelins, tapestry, manufactory, drawings, for, a, proposed, series, of, grisaille, paintings, of, the, labors, of, hercules, for, the, louvre, and, a, painting, of, the, triumph, of, truth, for, cardinal, richelieu, now, in, the, louvre, he, was, increasingly, unhappy, with, the, court, intrigues, and, the, overwhelming, number, of, commissions, in, the, autumn, of, 1642, when, the, king, and, court, were, out, of, paris, in, languedoc, he, found, a, pretext, to, leave, paris, and, to, return, permanently, to, rome, when, he, returned, to, rome, in, 1642, he, found, the, art, world, was, in, transition, pope, urban, viii, died, in, 1644, and, the, new, pope, innocent, x, was, less, interested, in, art, patronage, and, preferred, spanish, over, french, culture, poussin, s, great, patrons, the, barberinis, departed, rome, for, france, he, still, had, a, few, important, patrons, in, rome, including, cassiano, dal, pozzo, and, the, future, cardinal, camillo, massimi, but, began, to, paint, more, frequently, for, the, patrons, he, had, found, in, paris, cardinal, richelieu, died, in, 1642, and, louis, xiii, died, in, 1643, and, poussin, s, paris, sponsor, sublet, de, noyer, lost, his, position, but, richelieu, s, successor, cardinal, mazarin, began, to, collect, poussin, s, works, in, october, 1643, poussin, sold, the, furnishings, of, his, house, in, the, tuileries, in, paris, and, settled, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, rome, in, 1647, andr, f, libien, the, secretary, of, the, french, embassy, in, rome, became, a, friend, and, painting, student, of, poussin, and, published, the, first, book, devoted, entirely, to, his, work, his, growing, number, of, french, patrons, included, the, abb, louis, fouquet, brother, of, nicolas, fouquet, the, celebrated, superintendent, of, finances, of, the, young, louis, xiv, in, 1655, fouquet, obtained, for, poussin, official, recognition, of, his, earlier, title, as, first, painter, of, the, king, along, with, payment, for, his, past, french, commissions, to, thank, fouquet, poussin, made, designs, for, the, baths, fouquet, was, constructing, at, his, ch, teau, at, vaux, le, vicomte, another, important, french, patron, of, poussin, in, this, period, was, paul, fr, art, de, chantelou, who, came, to, rome, in, 1643, and, stayed, there, for, several, months, he, commissioned, from, poussin, some, of, his, most, important, works, including, the, second, series, of, the, seven, sacraments, painted, between, 1644, and, 1648, and, his, landscape, with, diogenes, in, 1649, he, painted, the, vision, of, st, paul, for, the, comic, poet, paul, scarron, and, in, 1651, the, holy, family, for, the, duc, de, cr, quy, landscapes, had, been, a, secondary, feature, of, his, early, work, in, his, later, work, nature, and, the, landscape, was, frequently, the, central, element, of, the, painting, he, lived, an, austere, and, comfortable, life, working, slowly, and, apparently, without, assistants, the, painter, charles, le, brun, joined, him, in, rome, for, three, years, and, poussin, s, work, had, a, major, influence, on, le, brun, s, style, in, 1647, his, patrons, chantelou, and, pointel, requested, portraits, of, poussin, he, responded, by, making, two, self, portraits, completed, together, in, 1649, he, suffered, from, declining, health, after, 1650, and, was, troubled, by, a, worsening, tremor, in, his, hand, evidence, of, which, is, apparent, in, his, late, drawings, nonetheless, in, his, final, eight, years, he, painted, some, of, the, most, ambitious, and, celebrated, of, his, works, including, the, birth, of, bacchus, orion, blinded, searching, for, the, sun, landscape, with, hercules, and, cacus, the, four, paintings, of, the, seasons, and, apollo, in, love, with, daphn, his, wife, anne, marie, died, in, 1664, and, thereafter, his, own, health, sank, rapidly, on, 21, september, he, dictated, his, will, and, he, died, in, rome, on, 19, november, 1665, and, was, buried, in, the, church, of, san, lorenzo, in, lucina, each, of, poussin, s, paintings, told, a, story, though, he, had, little, formal, education, poussin, became, very, knowledgeable, in, the, nuances, of, religious, history, mythology, and, classical, literature, and, usually, after, consulting, with, his, clients, took, his, subjects, from, these, topics, many, of, his, paintings, combined, several, different, incidents, occurring, at, different, times, into, the, same, painting, in, order, to, tell, the, story, and, the, affetti, or, facial, expressions, of, the, participants, showed, their, different, reactions, aside, from, his, self, portraits, poussin, never, painted, contemporary, subjects, religion, was, the, most, common, subject, of, his, paintings, as, the, church, was, the, most, important, art, patron, in, rome, and, because, there, was, a, growing, demand, by, wealthy, patrons, for, devotional, paintings, at, home, he, took, a, large, part, of, his, themes, from, the, old, testament, which, offered, more, variety, and, the, stories, were, often, more, vague, and, gave, him, more, freedom, to, invent, he, painted, different, versions, of, the, stories, of, eliazer, and, rebecca, from, the, book, of, genesis, and, made, three, versions, of, moses, saved, from, the, waters, the, new, testament, provided, the, subject, of, one, of, his, most, dramatic, paintings, the, massacre, of, the, innocents, where, the, general, slaughter, was, reduced, to, a, single, brutal, incident, in, his, judgement, of, solomon, 1649, the, story, can, be, read, in, the, varied, facial, expressions, of, the, participants, his, religious, paintings, were, sometimes, criticized, by, his, rivals, for, their, variation, from, tradition, his, painting, of, christ, in, the, sky, in, his, painting, of, saint, francis, xavier, was, criticized, by, partisans, of, simon, vouet, for, having, too, much, pride, and, resembling, the, god, jupiter, more, than, a, god, of, mercy, poussin, responded, that, he, could, not, and, should, not, imagine, a, christ, no, matter, what, he, is, doing, looking, like, a, gentle, father, considering, that, when, he, was, on, earth, among, men, it, was, difficult, to, look, him, in, the, face, the, most, famous, of, his, religious, works, were, the, two, series, called, the, seven, sacraments, representing, the, meaning, of, the, moral, laws, behind, each, of, the, principal, ceremonies, of, the, church, illustrated, by, incidents, in, the, life, of, christ, the, first, series, was, painted, in, rome, by, his, major, early, patron, cassiano, dal, pozzo, and, was, finished, in, 1642, it, was, viewed, by, his, later, patron, paul, fr, art, de, chantelou, who, asked, for, a, copy, instead, of, making, copies, poussin, painted, an, entirely, new, series, of, paintings, which, was, finished, by, 1647, the, new, series, had, less, of, the, freshness, and, originality, of, the, first, series, but, was, striking, for, its, simplicity, and, austerity, in, achieving, its, effects, the, second, series, illustrated, his, mastery, of, the, balance, of, the, figures, the, variety, of, expressions, and, the, juxtaposition, of, colors, classical, greek, and, roman, mythology, history, and, literature, provided, the, subjects, for, many, of, his, paintings, particularly, during, his, early, years, in, rome, his, first, successful, painting, in, rome, the, death, of, germanicus, was, based, upon, a, story, in, the, annals, of, tacitus, in, his, early, years, he, devoted, a, series, of, paintings, full, of, color, movement, and, sensuality, to, the, bacchanals, colorful, portrayals, of, ceremonies, devoted, to, the, god, of, wine, bacchus, and, celebrating, the, goddesses, venus, and, flore, he, also, created, the, birth, of, venus, 1635, telling, the, story, of, the, roman, goddess, through, an, elaborate, composition, full, of, dynamic, figures, for, the, french, patron, cardinal, richelieu, who, had, also, commissioned, the, bacchanals, many, of, his, mythological, paintings, featured, gardens, and, floral, themes, his, first, roman, patrons, the, barberini, family, had, one, of, largest, and, most, famous, gardens, in, rome, another, of, his, early, major, themes, was, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, recounting, how, the, king, of, rome, romulus, wanting, wives, for, his, soldiers, invited, the, members, of, the, neighboring, sabine, tribe, for, a, festival, and, then, on, his, signal, kidnapped, all, of, the, women, he, painted, two, versions, one, in, 1634, now, in, the, metropolitan, museum, and, the, other, in, 1637, now, in, the, louvre, he, also, painted, two, versions, illustrating, a, story, of, ovid, in, the, metamorphoses, in, which, venus, mourning, the, death, of, adonis, after, a, hunting, accident, transforms, his, blood, into, the, color, of, the, anemone, flower, throughout, his, career, poussin, frequently, achieved, what, the, art, historian, willibald, sauerl, nder, terms, a, consonance, between, the, pagan, and, the, christian, world, an, example, is, the, four, seasons, 1660, 64, in, which, christian, and, pagan, themes, are, mingled, spring, traditionally, personified, by, the, roman, goddess, flora, instead, features, adam, and, eve, in, the, garden, of, eden, summer, is, symbolized, not, by, ceres, but, by, the, biblical, ruth, in, his, later, years, his, mythological, paintings, became, more, somber, and, often, introduced, the, symbols, of, mortality, and, death, the, last, painting, he, was, working, on, before, his, death, was, apollo, in, love, with, daphne, which, he, presented, to, his, patron, the, future, cardinal, massimi, in, 1665, the, figures, on, the, left, of, the, canvas, around, apollo, largely, represented, vitality, and, life, while, those, on, the, right, around, daphne, were, symbols, of, sterility, and, death, he, was, unable, to, complete, the, painting, because, of, the, trembling, of, his, hand, and, the, figures, on, the, right, are, unfinished, besides, classical, literature, and, myth, he, drew, often, from, works, of, the, romantic, and, heroic, literature, of, his, own, time, usually, subjects, decided, in, advance, with, his, patrons, he, painted, scenes, from, the, epic, poem, jerusalem, delivered, by, torquato, tasso, 1544, 1595, published, in, 1581, and, one, of, the, most, popular, books, in, poussin, s, lifetime, his, painting, renaud, and, armide, illustrated, the, death, of, the, christian, knight, arnaud, at, the, hands, of, the, magician, armide, who, when, she, saw, his, face, saw, her, hatred, turn, to, love, another, poem, by, tasso, with, a, similar, theme, inspired, tancred, and, hermiene, a, woman, finds, a, wounded, knight, on, the, road, breaks, down, in, tears, then, finds, the, strength, through, love, to, heal, him, allegories, of, death, are, common, in, poussin, s, work, one, of, the, best, known, examples, is, et, in, arcadia, ego, a, subject, he, painted, in, about, 1630, and, again, in, the, late, 1630s, idealized, shepherds, examine, a, tomb, inscribed, with, the, title, phrase, even, in, arcadia, i, exist, reminding, that, death, was, ever, present, a, fertile, source, for, poussin, was, cardinal, giulio, rospigliosi, who, wrote, moralistic, theatrical, pieces, which, were, staged, at, the, palace, barberini, his, early, patron, one, of, his, most, famous, works, a, dance, to, the, music, of, time, was, inspired, by, another, rospigliosi, piece, according, to, his, early, biographers, bellori, and, felibien, the, four, figures, in, the, dance, represent, the, stages, of, life, poverty, leads, to, work, work, to, riches, and, riches, to, luxury, then, following, christian, doctrine, luxury, leads, back, to, poverty, and, the, cycle, begins, again, the, three, women, and, one, man, who, dance, represent, the, different, stages, and, are, distinguished, by, their, different, clothing, and, headdresses, ranging, from, plain, to, jeweled, in, the, sky, over, the, dancing, figures, the, chariot, of, apollo, passes, accompanied, by, the, goddess, aurora, and, the, hours, a, symbol, of, passing, time, poussin, is, an, important, figure, in, the, development, of, landscape, painting, in, his, early, paintings, the, landscape, usually, forms, a, graceful, background, for, a, group, of, figures, but, later, the, landscape, played, a, larger, and, larger, role, and, dominated, the, figures, illustrating, stories, usually, tragic, taken, from, the, bible, mythology, ancient, history, or, literature, his, landscapes, were, very, carefully, composed, with, the, vertical, trees, and, classical, columns, carefully, balanced, by, the, horizontal, bodies, of, water, and, flat, building, stones, all, organized, to, lead, the, eye, to, the, often, tiny, figures, the, foliage, in, his, trees, and, bushes, is, very, carefully, painted, often, showing, every, leaf, his, skies, played, a, particularly, important, part, from, the, blue, skies, and, gray, clouds, with, bright, sunlit, borders, a, sight, often, called, in, france, a, poussin, sky, to, illustrate, scenes, of, tranquility, and, the, serenity, of, faith, such, as, the, landscape, with, saint, john, on, patmos, painted, in, the, late, 1630s, before, his, departure, for, paris, or, extremely, dark, turbulent, and, threatening, as, a, setting, for, tragic, events, as, in, his, landscape, with, pyramus, and, thisbe, 1651, many, of, his, landscapes, have, enigmatic, elements, noticeable, only, with, closer, inspection, for, example, in, the, center, of, the, landscape, with, pyramus, and, thisbe, despite, the, storm, in, the, sky, the, surface, of, the, lake, is, perfectly, calm, reflecting, the, trees, between, 1650, and, 1655, poussin, also, painted, a, series, of, paintings, now, often, called, townscapes, where, classical, architecture, replaces, trees, and, mountains, in, the, background, the, painting, the, death, of, saphire, uses, this, setting, to, illustrate, two, stories, simultaneously, in, the, foreground, the, wife, of, a, wealthy, merchant, dies, after, being, chastised, by, st, peter, for, not, giving, more, money, to, the, poor, while, in, the, background, another, man, more, generous, gives, alms, to, a, beggar, throughout, his, life, poussin, stood, apart, from, the, popular, tendency, toward, the, decorative, in, french, art, of, his, time, in, poussin, s, works, a, survival, of, the, impulses, of, the, renaissance, is, coupled, with, conscious, reference, to, the, art, of, classical, antiquity, as, the, standard, of, excellence, rejecting, the, emotionalism, of, baroque, artists, such, as, bernini, and, pietro, da, cortona, he, emphasized, the, cerebral, his, goal, was, clarity, of, expression, achieved, by, disegno, or, nobility, of, design, in, preference, to, colore, or, color, during, the, late, 1620s, and, 1630s, he, experimented, and, formulated, his, own, style, he, studied, the, antique, as, well, as, works, such, as, titian, s, bacchanals, the, bacchanal, of, the, andrians, bacchus, and, ariadne, and, the, worship, of, venus, at, the, casino, ludovisi, and, the, paintings, of, domenichino, and, guido, reni, in, contrast, to, the, warm, and, atmospheric, style, of, his, early, paintings, poussin, by, the, 1630s, developed, a, cooler, palette, a, drier, touch, and, a, more, stage, like, presentation, of, figures, dispersed, within, a, well, defined, space, in, the, triumph, of, david, c, 1633, 34, dulwich, picture, gallery, the, figures, enacting, the, scene, are, arranged, in, rows, that, like, the, architectural, facade, that, serves, as, the, background, are, parallel, to, the, picture, plane, the, violence, of, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, c, 1638, louvre, has, the, same, abstract, choreographed, quality, seen, in, a, dance, to, the, music, of, time, 1639, 40, contrary, to, the, standard, studio, practice, of, his, time, poussin, did, not, make, detailed, figure, drawings, as, preparation, for, painting, and, he, seems, not, to, have, used, assistants, in, the, execution, of, his, paintings, he, produced, few, drawings, as, independent, works, aside, from, the, series, of, drawings, illustrating, ovid, s, metamorphoses, he, made, early, in, his, career, his, drawings, typically, in, pen, and, ink, wash, include, landscapes, drawn, from, nature, to, be, used, as, references, for, painting, and, composition, studies, in, which, he, blocked, in, his, figures, and, their, settings, to, aid, him, in, formulating, his, compositions, he, made, miniature, wax, figures, and, arranged, them, in, a, box, that, was, open, on, one, side, like, a, theatre, stage, to, serve, as, models, for, his, composition, sketches, pierre, rosenberg, described, poussin, as, not, a, brilliant, elegant, or, seductive, draughtsman, far, from, it, his, lack, of, virtuosity, is, however, compensated, for, by, uncompromising, rigour, there, is, never, an, irrelevant, mark, or, a, superfluous, line, in, the, years, following, poussin, s, death, his, style, had, a, strong, influence, on, french, art, thanks, in, particular, to, charles, le, brun, who, had, studied, briefly, with, poussin, in, rome, and, who, like, poussin, became, a, court, painter, for, the, king, and, later, the, head, of, the, french, academy, in, rome, poussin, s, work, had, an, important, influence, on, the, 17th, century, paintings, of, jacques, stella, and, s, bastien, bourdon, the, italian, painter, pier, francesco, mola, and, the, dutch, painter, gerard, de, lairesse, a, debate, emerged, in, the, art, world, between, the, advocates, of, poussin, s, style, who, said, the, drawing, was, the, most, important, element, of, a, painting, and, the, advocates, of, rubens, who, placed, color, above, the, drawing, during, the, french, revolution, poussin, s, style, was, championed, by, jacques, louis, david, in, part, because, the, leaders, of, the, revolution, looked, to, replace, the, frivolity, of, french, court, art, with, republican, severity, and, civic, mindedness, the, influence, of, poussin, was, evident, in, paintings, such, as, brutus, and, death, of, marat, benjamin, west, an, american, painter, of, the, 18th, century, who, worked, in, britain, found, inspiration, for, his, canvas, of, the, death, of, general, wolfe, in, poussin, s, the, death, of, germanicus, the, 19th, century, brought, a, resurgence, of, enthusiasm, for, poussin, french, writers, were, seeking, to, create, a, national, art, movement, and, poussin, became, one, of, their, heroes, the, founding, father, of, the, french, school, he, appears, in, plays, stories, and, novels, as, well, as, physiognomic, studies, he, also, became, the, model, for, the, myth, of, the, child, genius, who, becomes, the, miserable, artist, rejected, by, society, as, can, be, seen, in, francois, marius, granet, s, painting, of, the, death, of, poussin, one, of, his, greatest, admirers, was, ingres, who, studied, in, rome, and, became, director, of, the, french, academy, there, ingres, wrote, only, great, painters, of, history, can, paint, a, beautiful, landscape, he, poussin, was, the, first, and, only, to, capture, the, nature, of, italy, by, the, character, and, taste, of, his, compositions, he, proved, that, such, nature, belonged, to, him, so, much, so, that, when, facing, a, beautiful, site, one, says, and, says, correctly, that, it, is, poussinesque, another, 19th, century, admirer, of, poussin, was, ingres, great, rival, eug, ne, delacroix, he, wrote, in, 1853, the, life, of, poussin, is, reflected, in, his, works, it, is, in, perfect, harmony, with, the, beauty, and, nobility, of, his, inventions, poussin, was, one, of, the, greatest, innovators, found, in, the, history, of, painting, he, arrived, in, the, middle, of, the, school, of, mannerism, where, the, craft, was, preferred, to, the, intellectual, role, of, art, he, broke, with, all, of, that, falseness, c, zanne, appreciated, poussin, s, version, of, classicism, imagine, how, poussin, entirely, redid, nature, that, is, the, classicism, that, i, mean, what, i, don, t, accept, is, the, classicism, that, limits, you, i, want, that, a, visit, to, a, master, will, help, me, find, myself, every, time, i, leave, a, poussin, i, know, better, who, i, am, c, zanne, was, described, in, 1907, by, maurice, denis, as, the, poussin, of, impressionism, georges, seurat, was, another, post, impressionist, artist, who, admired, the, formal, qualities, of, poussin, s, work, in, the, 20th, century, some, art, critics, suggested, that, the, analytic, cubist, experiments, of, pablo, picasso, and, georges, braque, were, also, founded, upon, poussin, s, example, in, 1963, picasso, based, a, series, of, paintings, on, poussin, s, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, andr, derain, jean, h, lion, balthus, and, jean, hugo, were, other, modern, artists, who, acknowledged, the, influence, of, poussin, markus, l, pertz, made, a, series, of, paintings, in, 1989, 90, based, on, poussin, s, works, the, finest, collection, of, poussin, s, paintings, today, is, at, the, louvre, in, paris, other, significant, collections, are, in, the, national, gallery, in, london, the, national, gallery, of, scotland, the, dulwich, picture, gallery, the, mus, e, cond,
