leif, erikson, also, known, as, leif, the, lucky, c, 970s, c, 1018, to, 1025, was, a, norse, explorer, who, is, thought, to, have, been, the, first, european, to, set, foot, on, continental, america, approximately, half, a, millennium, before, christopher, columbus, according, to, the, sagas, of, icelanders, he, established, a, norse, settlement, at, vinland, which, is, usually, interpreted, as, being, coastal, north, america, there, is, ongoing, speculation, that, the, settlement, made, by, leif, and, his, crew, corresponds, to, the, remains, of, a, norse, settlement, found, in, newfoundland, canada, called, l, anse, aux, meadows, which, was, occupied, approximately, 1, 000, years, ago, leif, s, place, of, birth, is, unknown, although, it, is, assumed, to, have, been, in, iceland, his, father, erik, the, red, founded, the, first, norse, settlement, in, greenland, where, leif, was, later, raised, following, his, voyage, to, vinland, and, the, subsequent, death, of, his, father, leif, became, chief, of, the, greenland, settlement, he, had, two, known, sons, thorgils, born, in, the, hebrides, and, thorkell, who, succeeded, him, as, greenland, s, chieftain, leif, was, the, son, of, erik, the, red, and, his, wife, thjodhild, old, norse, j, hildur, and, through, his, paternal, line, the, grandson, of, thorvald, svaldsson, when, erik, the, red, was, young, his, father, was, banished, from, norway, for, manslaughter, and, the, family, went, into, exile, in, iceland, which, during, the, century, preceding, leif, s, birth, had, been, colonized, by, norsemen, mainly, from, norway, leif, was, also, a, distant, relative, of, naddodd, who, discovered, iceland, leif, s, year, of, birth, is, often, estimated, in, the, c, 970, s, though, his, birthplace, is, not, accounted, for, in, the, sagas, it, is, likely, he, was, born, in, iceland, where, his, parents, met, probably, somewhere, on, the, edge, of, brei, afj, r, ur, and, possibly, at, the, farm, haukadal, where, his, mother, s, family, was, based, erik, was, later, banished, from, iceland, and, sailed, west, to, a, place, he, named, greenland, he, then, briefly, returned, to, iceland, to, bring, his, family, and, other, colonists, back, with, him, to, greenland, establishing, its, first, permanent, settlement, in, 986, leif, grew, up, on, the, family, estate, brattahl, in, the, eastern, settlement, of, greenland, he, had, two, brothers, whose, names, were, thorstein, and, thorvald, and, a, sister, freyd, s, tyrker, one, of, erik, s, thralls, had, been, specially, trusted, to, keep, charge, of, erik, s, children, as, leif, later, referred, to, him, as, his, foster, father, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, and, the, saga, of, the, greenlanders, both, thought, to, have, been, written, around, 1200, contain, different, accounts, of, the, voyages, to, vinland, usually, interpreted, as, coastal, north, america, the, only, two, known, strictly, historical, mentions, of, vinland, are, found, in, the, work, of, adam, of, bremen, c, 1075, and, in, the, book, of, icelanders, compiled, c, 1122, by, ari, the, wise, according, to, this, saga, leif, discovered, vinland, after, being, blown, off, course, on, his, way, from, norway, to, greenland, before, this, voyage, leif, had, spent, time, at, the, court, of, norwegian, king, olaf, tryggvesson, where, he, had, converted, to, christianity, when, leif, encountered, the, storm, that, forced, him, off, course, he, had, been, on, his, way, to, introduce, christianity, to, the, greenlanders, after, they, had, arrived, at, an, unknown, shore, the, crew, disembarked, and, explored, the, area, they, found, wild, grapes, self, sown, wheat, and, maple, trees, afterwards, they, loaded, their, ship, with, samples, of, these, newly, found, goods, and, sailed, east, to, greenland, rescuing, a, group, of, shipwrecked, sailors, along, the, way, for, this, act, and, for, converting, norse, greenland, to, christianity, leif, earned, the, nickname, leif, the, lucky, leif, did, not, return, to, vinland, but, others, from, greenland, and, iceland, did, including, thorfinn, karlsefni, according, to, this, saga, leif, was, not, the, first, european, to, discover, vinland, instead, bjarni, herj, lfsson, and, his, crew, on, a, voyage, from, iceland, to, greenland, were, overtaken, by, wind, and, fog, missed, the, southern, tip, of, greenland, and, encountered, an, unknown, coast, believing, it, to, be, somewhere, other, than, greenland, they, did, not, disembark, but, rather, continued, to, sail, and, found, two, additional, coasts, that, did, not, correspond, with, their, understanding, of, greenland, after, sailing, back, east, they, eventually, made, it, to, their, original, destination, and, then, told, of, their, discoveries, roughly, 15, years, later, leif, approached, bjarni, purchased, his, ship, gathered, a, crew, of, thirty, five, men, and, mounted, an, expedition, towards, the, land, bjarni, had, described, his, father, erik, was, set, to, join, him, but, dropped, out, after, he, fell, from, his, horse, on, his, way, to, the, ship, an, incident, he, interpreted, as, a, bad, omen, leif, followed, bjarni, s, route, in, reverse, and, landed, first, in, a, rocky, and, desolate, place, he, named, helluland, flat, rock, land, possibly, baffin, island, or, northern, parts, of, labrador, after, venturing, further, by, sea, he, landed, the, second, time, in, a, forested, place, he, named, markland, forest, land, possibly, near, cape, porcupine, labrador, after, two, more, days, at, sea, he, landed, on, an, island, to, the, north, possibly, belle, isle, and, then, returned, to, the, mainland, going, past, a, cape, on, the, north, side, perhaps, cape, bauld, they, sailed, to, the, west, of, this, and, landed, in, a, verdant, area, with, a, mild, climate, and, plentiful, supplies, of, salmon, as, winter, approached, he, decided, to, encamp, there, and, sent, out, parties, to, explore, the, country, during, one, of, these, explorations, tyrker, discovered, that, the, land, was, full, of, vines, and, grapes, leif, therefore, named, the, land, vinland, wineland, there, he, and, his, crew, built, a, small, settlement, which, was, called, leifsbudir, leif, s, booths, by, later, visitors, from, greenland, after, having, wintered, over, in, vinland, leif, returned, to, greenland, in, the, spring, with, a, cargo, of, grapes, and, timber, on, the, return, voyage, he, rescued, an, icelandic, castaway, and, his, crew, earning, him, the, nickname, leif, the, lucky, leif, never, returned, to, vinland, but, others, from, greenland, and, iceland, did, most, researchers, and, scholars, agree, that, vinland, was, a, region, in, north, america, research, done, in, the, early, 1960s, by, norwegian, explorer, helge, ingstad, and, his, wife, archaeologist, anne, stine, ingstad, identified, a, norse, site, located, at, the, northern, tip, of, newfoundland, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, site, known, as, l, anse, aux, meadows, carbon, dating, estimates, 990, 1050, ce, and, tree, ring, analysis, dating, to, the, year, 1021, could, be, leifsbudir, the, ingstads, demonstrated, that, norsemen, had, reached, north, america, about, 500, years, before, christopher, columbus, later, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, vinland, may, have, been, the, areas, around, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, and, that, the, l, anse, aux, meadows, site, was, a, ship, repair, station, and, waypoint, for, voyages, there, that, does, not, necessarily, contradict, the, identification, of, l, anse, aux, meadows, as, leifsbudir, since, the, two, sagas, appear, to, describe, vinland, as, a, wider, region, which, included, several, settlements, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, mentions, two, other, settlements, in, vinland, one, called, straumfj, r, r, which, lay, beyond, kjalarnes, promontory, and, the, wonderstrands, and, one, called, h, p, which, was, located, even, farther, south, leif, has, been, described, in, the, vinland, sagas, as, a, wise, considerate, and, strong, man, of, striking, appearance, when, he, was, of, a, proper, age, leif, went, to, norway, likely, to, serve, as, a, retainer, to, its, king, olaf, tryggvason, it, was, on, this, journey, to, norway, that, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, states, that, leif, s, ship, was, driven, to, the, hebrides, where, he, and, his, crew, were, forced, to, remain, for, much, of, the, summer, awaiting, favorable, winds, during, his, stay, there, leif, fell, in, love, with, a, noblewoman, thorgunna, who, gave, birth, to, their, son, thorgils, thorgunna, remained, in, the, hebrides, when, leif, left, as, he, refused, to, take, her, along, without, permission, from, her, family, thorgils, was, later, sent, to, leif, in, greenland, but, he, did, not, become, popular, after, arriving, at, the, court, of, norway, s, king, olaf, tryggvason, leif, was, converted, to, christianity, according, to, both, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, and, olaf, tryggvason, s, saga, as, found, in, heimskringla, after, leif, s, conversion, the, king, then, commissioned, him, to, return, to, greenland, to, convert, the, settlers, there, during, the, journey, he, was, blown, off, course, and, discovered, vinland, before, finding, his, way, to, greenland, leif, s, father, erik, reacted, coldly, to, the, suggestion, that, he, should, abandon, his, religion, while, his, mother, thj, hildr, became, a, christian, and, built, a, church, called, thj, hild, s, church, a, different, version, of, olaf, tryggvason, s, saga, found, in, flateyjarb, k, makes, no, reference, to, leif, being, blown, off, course, and, discovering, vinland, during, his, return, from, norway, but, indicates, that, after, arriving, in, greenland, all, of, that, country, was, converted, including, leif, s, father, erik, some, versions, of, olaf, tryggvason, s, saga, also, indicate, that, to, help, with, the, conversion, leif, brought, a, priest, and, clerics, with, him, to, greenland, the, winter, following, leif, s, return, from, vinland, his, father, died, shortly, after, 1000, ce, making, leif, paramount, chief, in, greenland, leif, is, last, mentioned, alive, in, 1018, in, the, saga, of, st, olaf, according, to, the, saga, of, the, sworn, brothers, by, 1025, the, chieftaincy, of, eir, ksfj, r, r, had, passed, to, his, son, thorkel, nothing, is, mentioned, about, his, death, in, the, sagas, he, probably, died, in, greenland, some, time, between, these, dates, nothing, further, is, known, about, his, family, beyond, the, succession, of, thorkell, as, chieftain, leif, is, in, all, likelihood, a, historical, figure, who, remains, the, first, known, european, to, set, foot, in, continental, north, america, but, other, details, of, his, life, vary, and, are, a, subject, of, debate, it, has, been, suggested, by, several, scholars, that, both, leif, s, sister, freyd, s, and, his, foster, father, tyrker, are, works, of, fiction, as, are, their, roles, in, the, vinland, sagas, leif, s, commission, as, a, missionary, to, greenland, may, also, be, fictional, as, that, aspect, of, his, story, is, often, attributed, to, gunnlaugr, leifsson, s, version, of, l, fs, saga, tryggvasonar, which, likely, served, as, a, source, for, some, of, the, other, sagas, which, mention, leif, leif, s, successful, expedition, in, vinland, encouraged, other, norsemen, to, also, make, the, journey, and, the, norse, became, the, first, europeans, to, colonize, the, area, in, the, end, there, were, no, permanent, norse, settlements, although, sporadic, voyages, at, least, to, markland, for, forages, timber, and, trade, possibly, lasted, for, centuries, the, casual, tone, of, references, to, these, areas, may, suggest, that, their, discovery, was, not, seen, as, particularly, significant, by, contemporaries, or, that, it, was, assumed, to, be, public, knowledge, or, both, knowledge, of, the, vinland, journeys, spread, around, medieval, europe, although, to, what, extent, is, unclear, writers, made, mention, of, remote, lands, to, the, west, and, notably, the, medieval, chronicler, adam, of, bremen, directly, mentions, vinland, c, 1075, based, upon, reports, from, the, danes, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, knowledge, of, vinland, might, have, been, maintained, in, european, seaports, in, the, 15th, century, and, that, christopher, columbus, who, claimed, in, a, letter, to, have, visited, iceland, in, 1477, could, have, heard, stories, of, it, while, leif, had, no, contact, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, vinland, later, norse, explorers, did, referring, to, them, as, skr, lingi, an, archaic, term, for, wretches, according, to, the, saga, of, erik, the, red, the, first, encounter, was, made, during, a, colonizing, expedition, led, by, thorfinn, karlsefni, which, also, included, leif, s, brother, thorvald, at, first, this, group, traded, with, the, natives, but, weeks, later, the, new, norse, settlement, at, h, p, was, attacked, and, karlsefni, decided, to, abandon, it, the, norse, retreated, to, their, other, settlement, at, straumfj, r, r, where, they, remained, and, continued, to, explore, the, general, area, one, morning, they, encountered, a, one, legged, native, who, shot, an, arrow, that, killed, thorvald, he, is, famously, known, for, pulling, the, arrow, out, and, poetically, reciting, the, phrase, this, is, a, rich, country, we, have, found, there, is, plenty, of, fat, around, my, entrails, upon, which, he, dies, on, their, return, to, greenland, karlsefni, s, crew, captured, two, native, boys, taking, them, to, greenland, according, to, the, saga, of, the, greenlanders, leif, s, brother, thorvald, made, first, contact, with, the, natives, the, encounter, happened, while, thorvald, and, his, crew, were, exploring, the, coast, likely, in, the, markland, area, and, found, nine, natives, asleep, under, boats, they, attacked, the, natives, killing, eight, of, them, while, one, escaped, shortly, after, in, an, apparent, reprisal, thorvald, was, killed, by, a, native, s, arrow, later, thorfinn, karlsefni, led, a, group, to, colonize, vinland, and, encountered, natives, who, they, initially, traded, with, but, relations, soured, when, a, native, was, killed, attempting, to, steal, weapons, from, the, norse, in, retaliation, the, natives, attacked, and, karlsefni, decided, to, abandon, the, colony, stories, of, leif, s, journey, to, north, america, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, identity, and, self, perception, of, later, nordic, americans, and, nordic, immigrants, to, the, united, states, the, first, statue, of, erikson, by, anne, whitney, was, erected, in, boston, in, 1887, at, the, instigation, of, eben, norton, horsford, who, was, among, those, who, believed, that, vinland, could, have, been, located, on, the, charles, river, or, cape, cod, not, long, after, another, casting, of, whitney, s, statue, was, erected, in, milwaukee, a, statue, was, also, erected, in, chicago, in, 1901, having, been, originally, commissioned, for, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, to, coincide, with, the, arrival, of, the, reconstructed, viking, ship, from, bergen, norway, another, work, of, art, made, for, the, 1893, world, s, columbian, exposition, the, painting, leiv, eirikson, discovering, america, by, christian, krohg, was, in, the, possession, of, a, leif, erikson, memorial, association, in, chicago, before, being, given, back, to, the, national, gallery, of, norway, in, 1900, for, the, centenary, of, the, first, official, immigration, of, norwegians, to, america, president, calvin, coolidge, stated, at, the, 1925, minnesota, state, fair, to, a, crowd, of, 100, 000, people, that, leif, had, indeed, been, the, first, european, to, discover, america, additional, statues, of, him, were, erected, at, the, minnesota, state, capitol, in, st, paul, in, 1949, near, lake, superior, in, duluth, minnesota, in, 1956, and, in, downtown, seattle, in, 1924, a, party, of, four, consisting, of, a, swede, an, englishman, and, two, americans, attempted, to, emulate, leif, s, voyage, in, an, eponymous, 40, foot, vessel, but, were, lost, after, reaching, the, west, coast, of, greenland, 267, in, 1930, a, statue, of, leif, was, erected, in, the, city, center, of, reykjav, k, iceland, currently, situated, in, front, of, hallgr, mskirkja, as, a, gift, from, the, united, states, to, iceland, to, commemorate, the, 1, 000, year, anniversary, of, al, ingi, the, parliament, of, iceland, the, leif, erikson, awards, established, 2015, are, awarded, annually, by, the, exploration, museum, in, h, sav, k, iceland, they, are, awarded, for, achievements, in, exploration, and, in, the, study, of, the, history, of, exploration, several, ships, are, named, after, leif, a, viking, ship, replica, a, commercial, passenger, vehicle, ferry, and, a, large, dredger, erikson, is, recalled, as, leif, the, lucky, in, the, robert, frost, poem, wild, grapes, in, 1929, the, wisconsin, legislature, passed, a, bill, to, make, 9, october, leif, erikson, day, in, the, state, and, in, the, years, following, several, other, states, adopted, laws, to, observe, the, day, in, 1935, legislation, was, introduced, to, the, united, states, congress, requesting, federal, observance, of, the, day, before, the, legislation, was, passed, it, was, amended, so, that, the, observance, would, only, occur, in, 1935, which, it, was, following, a, proclamation, that, year, by, president, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, the, subsequent, decades, a, number, of, unsuccessful, attempts, were, made, to, pass, legislation, requesting, leif, erikson, day, be, proclaimed, annually, by, the, president, proponents, eventually, succeeded, when, in, 1964, the, congress, authorized, and, requested, the, president, to, proclaim, 9, october, of, each, year, as, leif, erikson, day, in, the, years, since, each, president, has, issued, an, annual, proclamation, calling, for, observance, of, the, day, the, sagas, do, not, give, the, exact, date, of, leif, s,
