in, vietnam, did, not, rival, the, party, outside, of, the, major, cities, but, particularly, in, the, south, in, saigon, cochinchina, they, had, been, a, challenge, from, the, outset, they, had, called, for, armed, resistance, to, a, french, restoration, and, an, immediate, transfer, of, industry, to, workers, and, land, to, peasants, the, french, socialist, leader, daniel, gu, rin, recalls, that, when, in, paris, in, 1946, he, asked, h, ch, minh, about, the, fate, of, the, trotskyist, leader, t, thu, th, u, h, ch, minh, had, replied, with, unfeigned, emotion, that, th, u, was, a, great, patriot, and, we, mourn, him, but, then, a, moment, later, added, in, a, steady, voice, all, those, who, do, not, follow, the, line, which, i, have, laid, down, will, be, broken, the, communists, eventually, suppressed, all, non, communist, parties, but, they, failed, to, secure, a, peace, deal, with, france, in, the, final, days, of, 1946, after, a, year, of, diplomatic, failure, and, many, concessions, in, agreements, such, as, the, dalat, and, fontainebleau, conferences, the, democratic, republic, of, vietnam, government, found, that, war, was, inevitable, the, bombardment, of, haiphong, by, the, french, navy, only, strengthened, the, belief, that, france, had, no, intention, of, allowing, an, autonomous, independent, state, in, vietnam, the, attack, reportedly, killed, more, than, 6, 000, vietnamese, civilians, in, haiphong, french, forces, marched, into, hanoi, now, the, capital, city, of, the, democratic, republic, of, vietnam, on, 19, december, 1946, after, the,

french, negotiators, arrived, at, the, meeting, site, they, found, a, mud, hut, with, a, thatched, roof, inside, they, found, a, long, table, with, chairs, in, one, corner, of, the, room, a, silver, ice, bucket, contained, ice, and, a, bottle, of, good, champagne, indicating, that, h, expected, the, negotiations, to, succeed, one, demand, by, the, french, was, the, return, to, french, custody, of, several, japanese, military, officers, who, had, been, helping, the, vietnamese, armed, forces, by, training, them, in, the, use, of, weapons, of, japanese, origin, for, them, to, stand, trial, for, war, crimes, committed, during, world, war, ii, h, ch, minh, replied, that, the, japanese, officers, were, allies, and, friends, whom, he, could, not, betray, therefore, he, walked, out, to, seven, more, years, of, war, in, february, 1950, after, the, battle, of, route, coloniale, 4, successfully, broke, the, french, border, blockade, he, met, with, joseph, stalin, and, mao, zedong, in,

in, august, that, china, planned, to, train, 60, 000, 70, 000, viet, minh, shortly, the, road, to, the, outside, world, was, open, for, vi, t, minh, forces, to, receive, additional, supplies, which, would, allow, them, to, escalate, the, fight, against, the, french, regime, throughout, indochina, at, the, outset, of, the, conflict, h, reportedly, told, a, french, visitor, you, can, kill, ten, of, my, men, for, every, one, i, kill, of, yours, but, even, at, those, odds, you, will, lose, and, i, will, win, in, 1954, the, first, indochina, war, came, to, an, end, after, the, decisive, battle, of, dien, bien, phu, where, more, than, 10, 000, french, soldiers, surrendered, to, the, viet, minh, the, subsequent, geneva, accords, peace, process, partitioned, north, vietnam, at, the, 17th, parallel,

under, the, supervision, of, local, commissions, the, united, states, with, the, support, of, britain, and, the, associated, states, of, vietnam, laos, and, cambodia, suggested, united, nations, supervision, this, plan, was, rejected, by, soviet, representative, vyacheslav, molotov, who, argued, for, a, commission, composed, of, an, equal, number, of, communist, and, non, communist, members, which, could, determine, important, issues, only, by, unanimous, agreement, the, negotiators, were, unable, to, agree, on, a, date, for, the, elections, for, reunification, north, vietnam, argued, that, the, elections, should, be, held, within, six, months, of, the, ceasefire, while, the, western, allies, sought, to, have, no, deadline, molotov, proposed, june, 1955, then, later, softened, this, to, any, time, in, 1955, and, finally, july, 1956, the, di, m, government, supported, reunification, elections, but, only, with, effective, international, supervision, arguing, that, genuinely, free, elections, were, otherwise, impossible, in, the, totalitarian, north, by, the, afternoon, of, 20, july, 1954, the, remaining, outstanding, issues, were, resolved, as, the, parties, agreed, that,

on, a, proposal, by, chinese, delegation, head, zhou, enlai, an, international, control, commission, icc, chaired, by, india, with, canada, and, poland, as, members, was, placed, in, charge, of,

the, treaty, the, unsigned, final, declaration, of, the, geneva, conference, called, for, reunification, elections, which, the, majority, of, delegates, expected, to, be, supervised, by, the, icc, the, vi, t, minh, never, accepted, icc, authority, over, such, elections, insisting, that, the, icc, s, competence, was, to, be, limited, to, the, supervision, and, control, of, the, implementation, of, the, agreement, on, the, cessation, of, hostilities, by, both, parties, of, the, nine, nations, represented, only, the, united, states, and, the, state, of, vietnam, refused, to, accept, the,

free, elections, supervised, by, the, united, nations, to, ensure, that, they, are, conducted, fairly, between, 1953, and, 1956, the, north, vietnamese, government, instituted, various, agrarian, reforms, including, rent, reduction, and, land, reform, which, were, accompanied, with, executions, of, reactionary, and, evil, landlords, during, the, land, reform, testimonies, by, north, vietnamese, witnesses, suggested, a, ratio, of, one, execution, per, 160, village, residents, which, if, extrapolated, would, indicate, a, nationwide, total, of, nearly, 100, 000, executions, because, the, campaign, was, concentrated, mainly, in, the, red, river, delta, area, a, lower, estimate, of, 50, 000, executions, was, widely, accepted, by, scholars, at, the, time, however, declassified, documents, from, the, vietnamese, and, hungarian, archives, indicate, that, the, number, of, executions, was, much, lower, than, reported, at, the, time, although, it, was, likely, greater, than, 13, 500, in, early, 1956, north, vietnam, ended, the, land, reform, and, initiated, a, correction, of, errors, to, rectify, the, mistakes, and, damage, done, that, year, h, ch, minh, apologised, and, acknowledged, the, serious, errors, the, government, had, made, in, the, land, reform, as, part, of, the, campaign, as, many, as, 23, 748, political, prisoners, were, released, by, north, vietnam, by, september, 1957, by, 1958, the, correction, campaign, had, resulted, in, the, return, of, land, to, many, of, those, harmed, by, the, land, reform, as, early, as, june, 1956, the, idea, of, overthrowing, the, south, vietnamese, government, was, presented, at, a, politburo, meeting, in, 1959, h, ch, minh, began, urging, the, politburo, to, send, aid, to, the, vi, t, c, ng, in, south, vietnam, a, people, s, war, on, the, south, was, approved, at, a, session, in, january, 1959, and, this, decision, was, confirmed, by, the, politburo, in, march, north, vietnam, invaded, laos, in, july, 1959, aided, by, the, pathet, lao, and, used, 30, 000, men, to, build, a, network, of, supply, and, reinforcement, routes, running, through, laos, and, cambodia, that, became, known, as, the, h, ch, minh, trail, it, allowed, the, north, to, send, manpower, and, material, to, the, vi, t, c, ng, with, much, less, exposure, to, south, vietnamese, forces, achieving, a, considerable, advantage, to, counter, the, accusation, that, north, vietnam, was, violating, the, geneva, accord, the, independence, of, the, vi, t, c, ng, was, stressed, in, communist, propaganda, north, vietnam, created, the, national, liberation, front, of, south, vietnam, in, december, 1960, as, a, united, front, or, political, branch, of, the, vi, t, c, ng, intended, to, encourage, the, participation, of, non, communists, at, the, end, of, 1959, aware, that, the, planned, national, elections, would, never, be, held, and, that, di, m, intended, to, purge, opposing, forces, mostly, ex, vi, t, minh, from, south, vietnamese, society, h, ch, minh, informally, chose, l, du, n, to, become, the, next, party, leader, this, was, interpreted, by, western, analysts, as, a, loss, of, influence, for, h, who, was, said, to, have, preferred, the, more, moderate, v, nguy, n, gi, p, for, the, position, from, 1959, onward, the, elderly, h, became, increasingly, worried, about, the, prospect, of, his, death, and, that, year, he, wrote, down, his, will, h, stepped, down, as, general, secretary, of, the, vietnam, communist, party, in, september, 1960, and, l, du, n, was, officially, named, party, leader, leaving, h, to, function, in, a, secondary, role, as, head, of, state, and, member, of, the, politburo, he, nevertheless, maintained, considerable, influence, in, the, government, l, du, n, t, h, u, tr, ng, chinh, and, ph, m, v, n, ng, often, shared, dinner, with, h, and, all, of, them, remained, key, figures, throughout, and, after, the, war, in, the, early, 1960s, the, north, vietnamese, politburo, was, divided, into, the, north, first, faction, which, favored, focusing, on, the, economic, development, of, north, vietnam, and, the, south, first, faction, which, favored, a, guerrilla, war, in, south, vietnam, to, reunite, the, country, within, the, short, term, between, 1961, and, 1963, 40, 000, communist, soldiers, infiltrated, south, vietnam, from, the, north, in, 1963, h, purportedly, corresponded, with, south, vietnamese, president, di, m, in, hopes, of, achieving, a, negotiated, peace, during, the, so, called, maneli, affair, of, 1963, a, french, diplomatic, initiative, was, launched, to, achieve, a, federation, of, the, two, vietnams, which, would, be, neutral, in, the, cold, war, the, four, principal, diplomats, involved, in, the, maneli, affair, were, ramchundur, goburdhun, the, indian, chief, commissioner, of, the, icc, mieczys, aw, maneli, the, polish, commissioner, to, the, icc, roger, lalouette, the, french, ambassador, to, south, vietnam, and, giovanni, d, orlandi, the, italian, ambassador, to, south, vietnam, maneli, reported, that, h, was, very, interested, in, the, signs, of, a, split, between, president, di, m, and, president, kennedy, and, that, his, attitude, was, our, real, enemies, are, the, americans, get, rid, of, them, and, we, can, cope, with, di, m, and, nhu, afterward, h, and, maneli, also, discussed, the, ho, chi, minh, trail, which, passed, through, officially, neutral, cambodia, and, laos, saying, indochina, is, just, one, single, entity, at, a, meeting, in, hanoi, held, in, french, h, told, goburdhun, that, di, m, was, in, his, way, a, patriot, noting, that, di, m, had, opposed, french, rule, over, vietnam, and, ended, the, meeting, saying, that, the, next, time, goburdhun, met, di, m, shake, hands, with, him, for, me, the, north, vietnamese, premier, ph, m, v, n, ng, speaking, on, behalf, of, h, told, maneli, he, was, interested, in, the, peace, plan, saying, that, just, as, long, as, the, american, advisers, left, south, vietnam, we, can, agree, with, any, vietnamese, on, 2, september, 1963, maneli, met, with, ng, nh, nhu, the, younger, brother, and, right, hand, man, to, di, m, to, discuss, the, french, peace, plan, it, remains, unclear, if, the, ngo, brothers, were, serious, about, the, french, peace, plan, or, were, merely, using, the, possibility, of, accepting, it, to, blackmail, the, united, states, into, supporting, them, at, a, time, when, the, buddhist, crisis, had, seriously, strained, relations, between, saigon, and, washington, supporting, the, latter, theory, is, the, fact, that, nhu, promptly, leaked, his, meeting, with, maneli, to, the, american, columnist, joseph, alsop, who, publicized, it, in, a, column, entitled, very, ugly, stuff, the, possibility, that, the, ngo, brothers, might, accept, the, peace, plan, contributed, to, the, kennedy, administration, s, plan, to, support, a, coup, against, them, on, 1, november, 1963, a, coup, overthrew, di, m, who, was, killed, the, next, day, together, with, his, brother, di, m, had, followed, a, policy, of, deconstructing, the, state, by, creating, several, overlapping, agencies, and, departments, that, were, encouraged, to, feud, with, one, another, to, disorganize, the, south, vietnamese, state, to, such, an, extent, that, he, hoped, that, it, would, make, a, coup, against, him, impossible, when, di, m, was, overthrown, and, killed, without, any, kind, of, arbiter, between, the, rival, arms, of, the, south, vietnamese, state, regime, authority, in, south, vietnam, promptly, disintegrated, the, american, defense, secretary, robert, mcnamara, reported, after, visiting, south, vietnam, in, december, 1963, that, there, is, no, organized, government, worthy, of, the, name, in, saigon, at, a, meeting, of, the, plenum, of, the, politburo, in, december, 1963, l, du, n, s, south, first, faction, triumphed, with, the, politburo, passing, a, resolution, calling, for, north, vietnam, to, complete, the, overthrow, of, the, regime, in, saigon, as, soon, as, possible, while, the, members, of, the, north, first, faction, were, dismissed, as, the, south, descended, into, chaos, whatever, interest, h, might, have, had, in, the, french, peace, plan, faded, as, it, became, clear, the, vi, t, c, ng, could, overthrow, the, saigon, government, a, cia, report, from, 1964, stated, that, factionalism, in, south, vietnam, had, reached, almost, the, point, of, anarchy, as, various, south, vietnamese, leaders, fought, one, another, making, any, sort, of, concerted, effort, against, the, vi, t, c, ng, impossible, leading, to, much, of, the, south, vietnamese, countryside, being, rapidly, taken, over, by, communist, guerilla, forces, as, south, vietnam, collapsed, into, factionalism, and, in, fighting, while, the, vi, t, c, ng, continued, to, win, the, war, it, became, increasingly, apparent, to, president, lyndon, johnson, that, only, american, military, intervention, could, save, south, vietnam, though, johnson, did, not, wish, to, commit, american, forces, until, he, had, won, the, 1964, election, he, decided, to, make, his, intentions, clear, to, hanoi, in, june, 1964, the, seaborn, mission, began, as, j, blair, seaborn, the, canadian, commissioner, to, the, icc, arrived, in, hanoi, with, a, message, from, johnson, offering, billions, of, american, economic, aid, and, diplomatic, recognition, in, exchange, for, which, north, vietnam, would, cease, trying, to, overthrow, the, government, of, south, vietnam, seaborn, also, warned, that, north, vietnam, would, suffer, the, greatest, devastation, from, american, bombing, saying, that, johnson, was, seriously, considering, a, strategic, bombing, campaign, against, north, vietnam, little, came, of, the, backchannel, of, the, seaborn, mission, as, the, north, vietnamese, distrusted, seaborn, who, pointedly, was, never, allowed, to, meet, h, in, late, 1964, the, people, s, army, of, vietnam, combat, troops, were, sent, southwest, into, officially, neutral, laos, and, cambodia, by, march, 1965, american, combat, troops, began, arriving, in, south, vietnam, first, to, protect, the, airbases, around, chu, lai, and, da, nang, later, to, take, on, most, of, the, fight, as, ore, and, more, american, troops, were, put, in, to, replace, saigon, troops, who, could, not, or, would, not, get, involved, in, the, fighting, as, fighting, escalated, widespread, aerial, and, artillery, bombardment, all, over, north, vietnam, by, the, united, states, air, force, and, navy, began, with, operation, rolling, thunder, on, 8, 9, april, 1965, h, made, a, secret, visit, to, beijing, to, meet, mao, zedong, it, was, agreed, that, no, chinese, combat, troops, would, enter, north, vietnam, unless, the, united, states, invaded, north, vietnam, but, that, china, would, send, support, troops, to, north, vietnam, to, help, maintain, the, infrastructure, damaged, by, american, bombing, there, was, deep, distrust, and, fear, of, china, within, the, north, vietnamese, politburo, and, the, suggestion, that, chinese, troops, even, support, troops, be, allowed, into, north, vietnam, caused, outrage, in, the, politburo, h, had, to, use, all, his, moral, authority, to, obtain, politburo, s, approval, according, to, chen, jian, during, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, l, du, n, permitted, 320, 000, chinese, volunteers, into, north, vietnam, to, help, build, infrastructure, for, the, country, thereby, freeing, a, similar, number, of, pavn, personnel, to, go, south, there, are, no, sources, from, vietnam, the, united, states, or, the, soviet, union, that, confirm, the, number, of, chinese, troops, stationed, in, north, vietnam, however, the, chinese, government, later, admitted, to, sending, 320, 000, chinese, soldiers, to, vietnam, during, the, 1960s, and, spent, over, 20, billion, to, support, hanoi, s, regular, north, vietnamese, army, and, vi, t, c, ng, guerrilla, units, to, counter, the, american, bombing, the, entire, population, of, north, vietnam, was, mobilized, for, the, war, effort, with, vast, teams, of, women, being, used, to, repair, the, damage, to, roads, and, bridges, done, by, the, aerial, bombers, often, at, a, speed, that, astonished, the, americans, the, bombing, of, north, vietnam, proved, to, be, the, principal, obstacle, to, opening, peace, talks, as, h, repeatedly, stated, that, no, peace, talks, would, be, possible, unless, the, united, states, unconditionally, ceased, bombing, north, vietnam, like, many, of, the, other, leaders, of, the, newly, independent, states, of, asia, and, africa, h, was, extremely, sensitive, about, threats, whether, perceived, or, real, to, his, nation, s, independence, and, sovereignty, h, regarded, the, american, bombing, as, a, violation, of, north, vietnam, s, sovereignty, and, he, felt, that, to, negotiate, with, the, americans, reserving, the, right, to, bomb, north, vietnam, should, he, not, behave, as, they, wanted, him, to, do, would, diminish, north, vietnam, s, independence, in, march, 1966, a, canadian, diplomat, chester, ronning, arrived, in, hanoi, with, an, offer, to, use, his, good, offices, to, begin, peace, talks, however, the, ronning, mission, foundered, upon, the, bombing, issue, as, the, north, vietnamese, demanded, an, unconditional, halt, to, the, bombing, an, undertaking, that, johnson, refused, to, give, in, june, 1966, janusz, lewandowski, the, polish, commissioner, to, the, icc, was, able, via, d, orlandi, to, see, henry, cabot, lodge, jr, the, american, ambassador, to, south, vietnam, with, an, offer, from, h, h, s, offer, for, a, political, compromise, as, transmitted, by, lewandowski, included, allowing, south, vietnam, to, maintain, its, alliance, with, the, u, s, instead, of, becoming, neutral, having, the, vi, t, c, ng, take, part, in, negotiations, for, a, coalition, government, instead, of, being, allowed, to, automatically, enter, a, coalition, government, and, allowing, a, reasonable, calendar, for, the, withdrawal, of, american, troops, instead, of, an, immediate, withdrawal, operation, marigold, as, the, lewandowski, channel, came, to, be, codenamed, almost, led, to, american, north, vietnamese, talks, in, warsaw, in, december, 1966, but, such, plans, ultimately, collapsed, over, the, bombing, issue, in, january, 1967, general, nguy, n, ch, thanh, the, commander, of, communist, forces, in, south, vietnam, returned, to, hanoi, to, present, a, plan, that, became, the, genesis, of, the, tet, offensive, a, year, later, thanh, expressed, much, concern, about, the, americans, invading, laos, to, cut, the, ho, chi, minh, trail, and, to, preempt, this, possibility, urged, an, all, out, offensive, to, win, the, war, with, a, sudden, blow, l, du, n, supported, thanh, s, plans, which, were, stoutly, opposed, by, the, defense, minister, general, v, nguy, n, gi, p, who, preferred, to, continue, with, guerrilla, war, arguing, that, superior, american, firepower, would, ensure, the, failure, of, thanh, s, proposed, offensive, with, the, politburo, divided, it, was, agreed, to, study, and, debate, the, issue, more, in, july, 1967, h, ch, minh, and, most, of, the, politburo, of, the, communist, party, met, in, a, high, profile, conference, where, they, concluded, that, the, war, had, fallen, into, a,

road, to, power, in, vietnam, 1982, duiker, suggests, that, h, ch, minh, s, cult, of, personality, is, indicative, of, a, larger, legacy, one, that, drew, on, elements, traditional, to, the, exercise, of, control, and, authority, in, vietnamese, society, duiker, is, drawn, to, an, irresistible, and, persuasive, comparison, with, china, as, in, china, leading, party, cadres, were, most, likely, to, be, intellectuals, descended, from, rural, scholar, gentry, families, in, the, interior, the, protectorates, of, annam, and, tonkin, conversely, the, pioneers, of, constitutional, nationalism, tended, to, be, from, the, more, westernised, coastal, south, saigon, and, surrounding, french, direct, rule, cochinchina, and, to, be, from, commercial, families, without, a, traditional, confucian, background, in, vietnam, as, in, china, communism, presented, itself, as, a, root, and, branch, rejection, of, confucianism, condemned, for, its, ritualism, inherent, conservatism, and, resistance, to, change, once, in, power, the, vietnamese, communists, may, not, have, fought, confucianism, as, bitterly, as, did, their, chinese, counterparts, but, its, social, prestige, was, essentially,

conception, of, social, equality, destroyed, the, confucian, views, of, class, duiker, argues, many, were, to, find, the, new, ideology, congenial, precisely, because, of, its, similarities, with, the, teachings, of, the, old, master, the, belief, in, one, truth, embodied, in, quasi, sacred, texts, in, an, anointed, elite, trained, in, an, all, embracing, doctrine, and, responsible, for, leading, the, broad, masses, and, indoctrinating, them, in, proper, thought, and, behavior, in, the, subordination, of, the, individual, to, the, community, and, in, the, perfectibility, through, corrective, action, of, human, nature, all, of, this, duiker, suggests, was, in, some, manner, present, in, the, aura, of, the, new, master, chi, minh, the, bringer, of, light, uncle, h, to, whom, all, the, desirable, qualities, of, confucian, ethics, are, ascribed, under, h, ch, minh, vietnamese, marxism, developed, in, effect, as, a, kind, of, reformed, confucianism, revised, to, meet, the, challenges, of, the, modern, era, and, not, least, among, these, of, total, mobilization, in, the, struggle, for, national, independence, and, state, power, this, congeniality, with, confucian, tradition, was, remarked, on, by, nguyen, khac, vien, a, leading, hanoi, intellectual, of, the, 1960s, and, 70s, in, confucianism, and, marxism, in, vietnam, nguyen, khac, vien, saw, definite, parallels, between, confucian, and, party, discipline, between, the, traditional, scholar, gentry, and, h, ch, minh, s, party, cadres, a, completely, different, form, of, the, cult, of, h, ch, minh, and, one, tolerated, by, the, government, with, uneasiness, is, his, identification, in, vietnamese, folk, religion, with, the, jade, emperor, who, supposedly, incarnated, again, on, earth, as, h, ch,
