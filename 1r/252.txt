century, italian, renaissance, and, the, founding, of, renaissance, humanism, in, the, 16th, century, pietro, bembo, created, the, model, for, the, modern, italian, language, based, on, petrarch, s, works, as, well, as, those, of, giovanni, boccaccio, and, to, a, lesser, extent, dante, alighieri, petrarch, was, later, endorsed, as, a, model, for, italian, style, by, the, accademia, della, crusca, petrarch, s, sonnets, were, admired, and, imitated, throughout, europe, during, the, renaissance, and, became, a, model, for, lyrical, poetry, he, is, also, known, for, being, the, first, to, develop, the, concept, of, the, dark, ages, petrarch, was, born, in, the, tuscan, city, of, arezzo, on, 20, july, 1304, he, was, the, son, of, ser, petracco, a, diminutive, nickname, for, pietro, and, his, wife, eletta, canigiani, petrarch, s, birth, name, was, francesco, di, petracco, francesco, of, petracco, which, he, latinized, to, franciscus, petrarcha, his, younger, brother, gherardo, gerard, petrarch, was, born, in, incisa, in, val, d, arno, in, 1307, dante, alighieri, was, a, friend, of, his, father, petrarch, spent, his, early, childhood, in, the, village, of, incisa, near, florence, he, spent, much, of, his, early, life, at, avignon, and, nearby, carpentras, where, his, family, moved, to, follow, pope, clement, v, who, moved, there, in, 1309, to, begin, the, avignon, papacy, petrarch, studied, law, at, the, university, of, montpellier, 1316, 20, and, bologna, 1320, 23, with, a, lifelong, friend, and, schoolmate, guido, sette, future, archbishop, of, genoa, because, his, father, was, in, the, legal, profession, a, notary, he, insisted, that, petrarch, and, his, brother, also, study, law, petrarch, however, was, primarily, interested, in, writing, and, studying, latin, literature, and, considered, these, seven, years, wasted, petrarch, became, so, distracted, by, his, non, legal, interests, that, his, father, once, threw, his, books, into, a, fire, which, he, later, lamented, additionally, he, proclaimed, that, through, legal, manipulation, his, guardians, robbed, him, of, his, small, property, inheritance, in, florence, which, only, reinforced, his, dislike, for, the, legal, system, he, protested, i, couldn, t, face, making, a, merchandise, of, my, mind, since, he, viewed, the, legal, system, as, the, art, of, selling, justice, petrarch, was, a, prolific, letter, writer, and, counted, boccaccio, among, the, notable, friends, with, whom, he, regularly, corresponded, after, the, death, of, their, parents, petrarch, and, his, brother, gherardo, went, back, to, avignon, in, 1326, where, he, worked, in, numerous, clerical, offices, this, work, gave, him, much, time, to, devote, to, his, writing, with, his, first, large, scale, work, africa, an, epic, poem, in, latin, about, the, great, roman, general, scipio, africanus, petrarch, emerged, as, a, european, celebrity, on, 8, april, 1341, he, became, the, second, poet, laureate, since, classical, antiquity, and, was, crowned, by, roman, senatori, giordano, orsini, and, orso, dell, anguillara, on, the, holy, grounds, of, rome, s, capitol, he, traveled, widely, in, europe, served, as, an, ambassador, and, has, been, called, the, first, tourist, because, he, traveled, for, pleasure, such, as, his, ascent, of, mont, ventoux, during, his, travels, he, collected, crumbling, latin, manuscripts, and, was, a, prime, mover, in, the, recovery, of, knowledge, from, writers, of, rome, and, greece, he, encouraged, and, advised, leontius, pilatus, s, translation, of, homer, from, a, manuscript, purchased, by, boccaccio, although, he, was, severely, critical, of, the, result, petrarch, had, acquired, a, copy, which, he, did, not, entrust, to, leontius, but, he, knew, no, greek, petrarch, said, of, himself, homer, was, dumb, to, him, while, he, was, deaf, to, homer, in, 1345, he, personally, discovered, a, collection, of, cicero, s, letters, not, previously, known, to, have, existed, the, collection, epistulae, ad, atticum, in, the, chapter, library, biblioteca, capitolare, of, verona, cathedral, disdaining, what, he, believed, to, be, the, ignorance, of, the, era, in, which, he, lived, petrarch, is, credited, with, creating, the, concept, of, a, historical, dark, ages, which, most, modern, scholars, now, find, inaccurate, and, misleading, petrarch, recounts, that, on, 26, april, 1336, with, his, brother, and, two, servants, he, climbed, to, the, top, of, mont, ventoux, 1, 912, meters, 6, 273, ft, a, feat, which, he, undertook, for, recreation, rather, than, necessity, the, exploit, is, described, in, a, famous, letter, addressed, to, his, friend, and, confessor, the, monk, dionigi, di, borgo, san, sepolcro, composed, some, time, after, the, fact, in, it, petrarch, claimed, to, have, been, inspired, by, philip, v, of, macedon, s, ascent, of, mount, haemo, and, that, an, aged, peasant, had, told, him, that, nobody, had, ascended, ventoux, before, or, after, himself, 50, years, earlier, and, warned, him, against, attempting, to, do, so, the, nineteenth, century, swiss, historian, jacob, burckhardt, noted, that, jean, buridan, had, climbed, the, same, mountain, a, few, years, before, and, ascents, accomplished, during, the, middle, ages, have, been, recorded, including, that, of, anno, ii, archbishop, of, cologne, scholars, note, that, petrarch, s, letter, to, dionigi, displays, a, strikingly, modern, attitude, of, aesthetic, gratification, in, the, grandeur, of, the, scenery, and, is, still, often, cited, in, books, and, journals, devoted, to, the, sport, of, mountaineering, in, petrarch, this, attitude, is, coupled, with, an, aspiration, for, a, virtuous, christian, life, and, on, reaching, the, summit, he, took, from, his, pocket, a, volume, by, his, beloved, mentor, saint, augustine, that, he, always, carried, with, him, for, pleasure, alone, he, climbed, mont, ventoux, which, rises, to, more, than, six, thousand, feet, beyond, vaucluse, it, was, no, great, feat, of, course, but, he, was, the, first, recorded, alpinist, of, modern, times, the, first, to, climb, a, mountain, merely, for, the, delight, of, looking, from, its, top, or, almost, the, first, for, in, a, high, pasture, he, met, an, old, shepherd, who, said, that, fifty, years, before, he, had, attained, the, summit, and, had, got, nothing, from, it, save, toil, and, repentance, and, torn, clothing, petrarch, was, dazed, and, stirred, by, the, view, of, the, alps, the, mountains, around, lyons, the, rhone, the, bay, of, marseilles, he, took, augustine, s, confessions, from, his, pocket, and, reflected, that, his, climb, was, merely, an, allegory, of, aspiration, toward, a, better, life, as, the, book, fell, open, petrarch, s, eyes, were, immediately, drawn, to, the, following, words, and, men, go, about, to, wonder, at, the, heights, of, the, mountains, and, the, mighty, waves, of, the, sea, and, the, wide, sweep, of, rivers, and, the, circuit, of, the, ocean, and, the, revolution, of, the, stars, but, themselves, they, consider, not, petrarch, s, response, was, to, turn, from, the, outer, world, of, nature, to, the, inner, world, of, soul, i, closed, the, book, angry, with, myself, that, i, should, still, be, admiring, earthly, things, who, might, long, ago, have, learned, from, even, the, pagan, philosophers, that, nothing, is, wonderful, but, the, soul, which, when, great, itself, finds, nothing, great, outside, itself, then, in, truth, i, was, satisfied, that, i, had, seen, enough, of, the, mountain, i, turned, my, inward, eye, upon, myself, and, from, that, time, not, a, syllable, fell, from, my, lips, until, we, reached, the, bottom, again, e, look, about, us, for, what, is, to, be, found, only, within, how, many, times, think, you, did, i, turn, back, that, day, to, glance, at, the, summit, of, the, mountain, which, seemed, scarcely, a, cubit, high, compared, with, the, range, of, human, contemplation, james, hillman, argues, that, this, rediscovery, of, the, inner, world, is, the, real, significance, of, the, ventoux, event, the, renaissance, begins, not, with, the, ascent, of, mont, ventoux, but, with, the, subsequent, descent, the, return, to, the, valley, of, soul, as, hillman, puts, it, arguing, against, such, a, singular, and, hyperbolic, periodization, paul, james, suggests, a, different, reading, in, the, alternative, argument, that, i, want, to, make, these, emotional, responses, marked, by, the, changing, senses, of, space, and, time, in, petrarch, s, writing, suggest, a, person, caught, in, unsettled, tension, between, two, different, but, contemporaneous, ontological, formations, the, traditional, and, the, modern, petrarch, spent, the, later, part, of, his, life, journeying, through, northern, italy, and, southern, france, as, an, international, scholar, and, poet, diplomat, his, career, in, the, church, did, not, allow, him, to, marry, but, he, is, believed, to, have, fathered, two, children, by, a, woman, or, women, unknown, to, posterity, a, son, giovanni, was, born, in, 1337, and, a, daughter, francesca, was, born, in, 1343, he, later, legitimized, both, for, a, number, of, years, in, the, 1340s, and, 1350s, he, lived, in, a, small, house, at, fontaine, de, vaucluse, east, of, avignon, in, france, giovanni, died, of, the, plague, in, 1361, in, the, same, year, petrarch, was, named, canon, in, monselice, near, padua, francesca, married, francescuolo, da, brossano, who, was, later, named, executor, of, petrarch, s, will, that, same, year, in, 1362, shortly, after, the, birth, of, a, daughter, eletta, the, same, name, as, petrarch, s, mother, they, joined, petrarch, in, venice, to, flee, the, plague, then, ravaging, parts, of, europe, a, second, grandchild, francesco, was, born, in, 1366, but, died, before, his, second, birthday, francesca, and, her, family, lived, with, petrarch, in, venice, for, five, years, from, 1362, to, 1367, at, palazzo, molina, although, petrarch, continued, to, travel, in, those, years, between, 1361, and, 1369, the, younger, boccaccio, paid, the, older, petrarch, two, visits, the, first, was, in, venice, the, second, was, in, padua, about, 1368, petrarch, and, francesca, with, her, family, moved, to, the, small, town, of, arqu, in, the, euganean, hills, near, padua, where, he, passed, his, remaining, years, in, religious, contemplation, he, died, in, his, house, in, arqu, on, 18, 19, july, 1374, the, house, now, hosts, a, permanent, exhibition, of, petrarch, s, works, and, curiosities, including, the, famous, tomb, of, an, embalmed, cat, long, believed, to, be, petrarch, s, although, there, is, no, evidence, petrarch, actually, had, a, cat, on, the, marble, slab, there, is, a,

laura, s, grace, and, beauty, she, first, inspired, the, poet, s, lay, but, since, i, drove, the, mice, away, his, love, repaid, my, duty, through, all, my, exemplary, life, so, well, did, i, in, constant, strife, employ, my, claws, and, curses, that, even, now, though, i, am, dead, those, nibbling, wretches, dare, not, tread, on, one, of, petrarch, s, verses, petrarch, s, will, dated, 4, april, 1370, leaves, fifty, florins, to, boccaccio, to, buy, a, warm, winter, dressing, gown, various, legacies, a, horse, a, silver, cup, a, lute, a, madonna, to, his, brother, and, his, friends, his, house, in, vaucluse, to, its, caretaker, money, for, masses, offered, for, his, soul, and, money, for, the, poor, and, the, bulk, of, his, estate, to, his, son, in, law, francescuolo, da, brossano, who, is, to, give, half, of, it, to, the, person, to, whom, as, he, knows, i, wish, it, to, go, presumably, his, daughter, francesca, brossano, s, wife, the, will, mentions, neither, the, property, in, arqu, nor, his, library, petrarch, s, library, of, notable, manuscripts, was, already, promised, to, venice, in, exchange, for, the, palazzo, molina, this, arrangement, was, probably, cancelled, when, he, moved, to, padua, the, enemy, of, venice, in, 1368, the, library, was, seized, by, the, lords, of, padua, and, his, books, and, manuscripts, are, now, widely, scattered, over, europe, nevertheless, the, biblioteca, marciana, traditionally, claimed, this, bequest, as, its, founding, although, it, was, in, fact, founded, by, cardinal, bessarion, in, 1468, petrarch, is, best, known, for, his, italian, poetry, notably, the, rerum, vulgarium, fragmenta, fragments, of, vernacular, matters, a, collection, of, 366, lyric, poems, in, various, genres, also, known, as, canzoniere, songbook, and, i, trionfi, the, triumphs, a, six, part, narrative, poem, of, dantean, inspiration, however, petrarch, was, an, enthusiastic, latin, scholar, and, did, most, of, his, writing, in, this, language, his, latin, writings, include, scholarly, works, introspective, essays, letters, and, more, poetry, among, them, are, secretum, my, secret, book, an, intensely, personal, imaginary, dialogue, with, a, figure, inspired, by, augustine, of, hippo, de, viris, illustribus, on, famous, men, a, series, of, moral, biographies, rerum, memorandarum, libri, an, incomplete, treatise, on, the, cardinal, virtues, de, otio, religiosorum, on, religious, leisure, and, de, vita, solitaria, on, the, solitary, life, which, praise, the, contemplative, life, de, remediis, utriusque, fortunae, remedies, for, fortune, fair, and, foul, a, self, help, book, which, remained, popular, for, hundreds, of, years, itinerarium, petrarch, s, guide, to, the, holy, land, invectives, against, opponents, such, as, doctors, scholastics, and, the, french, the, carmen, bucolicum, a, collection, of, 12, pastoral, poems, and, the, unfinished, epic, africa, he, translated, seven, psalms, a, collection, known, as, the, penitential, psalms, petrarch, also, published, many, volumes, of, his, letters, including, a, few, written, to, long, dead, figures, from, history, such, as, cicero, and, virgil, cicero, virgil, and, seneca, were, his, literary, models, most, of, his, latin, writings, are, difficult, to, find, today, but, several, of, his, works, are, available, in, english, translations, several, of, his, latin, works, are, scheduled, to, appear, in, the, harvard, university, press, series, i, tatti, it, is, difficult, to, assign, any, precise, dates, to, his, writings, because, he, tended, to, revise, them, throughout, his, life, petrarch, collected, his, letters, into, two, major, sets, of, books, called, rerum, familiarum, liber, letters, on, familiar, matters, and, seniles, letters, of, old, age, both, of, which, are, available, in, english, translation, the, plan, for, his, letters, was, suggested, to, him, by, knowledge, of, cicero, s, letters, these, were, published, without, names, to, protect, the, recipients, all, of, whom, had, close, relationships, to, petrarch, the, recipients, of, these, letters, included, philippe, de, cabassoles, bishop, of, cavaillon, ildebrandino, conti, bishop, of, padua, cola, di, rienzo, tribune, of, rome, francesco, nelli, priest, of, the, prior, of, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, in, florence, and, niccol, di, capoccia, a, cardinal, and, priest, of, saint, vitalis, his, letter, to, posterity, the, last, letter, in, seniles, gives, an, autobiography, and, a, synopsis, of, his, philosophy, in, life, it, was, originally, written, in, latin, and, was, completed, in, 1371, or, 1372, the, first, such, autobiography, in, a, thousand, years, since, saint, augustine, while, petrarch, s, poetry, was, set, to, music, frequently, after, his, death, especially, by, italian, madrigal, composers, of, the, renaissance, in, the, 16th, century, only, one, musical, setting, composed, during, petrarch, s, lifetime, survives, this, is, non, al, suo, amante, by, jacopo, da, bologna, written, around, 1350, on, 6, april, 1327, after, petrarch, gave, up, his, vocation, as, a, priest, the, sight, of, a, woman, called, laura, in, the, church, of, sainte, claire, d, avignon, awoke, in, him, a, lasting, passion, celebrated, in, the, rerum, vulgarium, fragmenta, fragments, of, vernacular, matters, laura, may, have, been, laura, de, noves, the, wife, of, count, hugues, de, sade, an, ancestor, of, the, marquis, de, sade, there, is, little, definite, information, in, petrarch, s, work, concerning, laura, except, that, she, is, lovely, to, look, at, fair, haired, with, a, modest, dignified, bearing, laura, and, petrarch, had, little, or, no, personal, contact, according, to, his, secretum, she, refused, him, because, she, was, already, married, he, channeled, his, feelings, into, love, poems, that, were, exclamatory, rather, than, persuasive, and, wrote, prose, that, showed, his, contempt, for, men, who, pursue, women, upon, her, death, in, 1348, the, poet, found, that, his, grief, was, as, difficult, to, live, with, as, was, his, former, despair, later, in, his, letter, to, posterity, petrarch, wrote, in, my, younger, days, i, struggled, constantly, with, an, overwhelming, but, pure, love, affair, my, only, one, and, i, would, have, struggled, with, it, longer, had, not, premature, death, bitter, but, salutary, for, me, extinguished, the, cooling, flames, i, certainly, wish, i, could, say, that, i, have, always, been, entirely, free, from, desires, of, the, flesh, but, i, would, be, lying, if, i, did, while, it, is, possible, she, was, an, idealized, or, pseudonymous, character, particularly, since, the, name, laura, has, a, linguistic, connection, to, the, poetic, laurels, petrarch, coveted, petrarch, himself, always, denied, it, his, frequent, use, of, l, aura, is, also, remarkable, for, example, the, line, erano, i, capei, d, oro, a, l, aura, sparsi, may, mean, both, her, hair, was, all, over, laura, s, body, and, the, wind, l, aura, blew, through, her, hair, there, is, psychological, realism, in, the, description, of, laura, although, petrarch, draws, heavily, on, conventionalised, descriptions, of, love, and, lovers, from, troubadour, songs, and, other, literature, of, courtly, love, her, presence, causes, him, unspeakable, joy, but, his, unrequited, love, creates, unendurable, desires, inner, conflicts, between, the, ardent, lover, and, the, mystic, christian, making, it, impossible, to, reconcile, the, two, petrarch, s, quest, for, love, leads, to, hopelessness, and, irreconcilable, anguish, as, he, expresses, in, the, series, of, paradoxes, in, rima, 134, pace, non, trovo, et, non, da, far, guerra, e, temo, et, spero, et, ardo, et, son, un, ghiaccio, i, find, no, peace, and, yet, i, make, no, war, and, fear, and, hope, and, burn, and, i, am, ice, laura, is, unreachable, and, evanescent, descriptions, of, her, are, evocative, yet, fragmentary, francesco, de, sanctis, praises, the, powerful, music, of, his, verse, in, his, storia, della, letteratura, italiana, gianfranco, contini, in, a, famous, essay, preliminari, sulla, lingua, del, petrarca, petrarca, canzoniere, turin, einaudi, 1964, has, described, petrarch, s, language, in, terms, of, unilinguismo, contrasted, with, dantean, plurilinguismo, aura, che, quelle, chiome, bionde, et, crespe, cercondi, et, movi, et, se, mossa, da, loro, soavemente, et, spargi, quel, dolce, oro, et, poi, l, raccogli, e, n, bei, nodi, il, rincrespe, tu, stai, nelli, occhi, ond,

seeing, her, happy, air, remain, here, with, your, living, rays, and, you, clear, running, stream, why, can, t, i, exchange, my, path, for, yours, petrarch, is, very, different, from, dante, and, his, divina, commedia, in, spite, of, the, metaphysical, subject, the, commedia, is, deeply, rooted, in, the, cultural, and, social, milieu, of, turn, of, the, century, florence, dante, s, rise, to, power, 1300, and, exile, 1302, his, political, passions, call, for, a, violent, use, of, language, where, he, uses, all, the, registers, from, low, and, trivial, to, sublime, and, philosophical, petrarch, confessed, to, boccaccio, that, he, had, never, read, the, commedia, remarks, contini, wondering, whether, this, was, true, or, petrarch, wanted, to, distance, himself, from, dante, dante, s, language, evolves, as, he, grows, old, from, the, courtly, love, of, his, early, stilnovistic, rime, and, vita, nuova, to, the, convivio, and, divina, commedia, where, beatrice, is, sanctified, as, the, goddess, of, philosophy, the, philosophy, announced, by, the, donna, gentile, at, the, death, of, beatrice, in, contrast, petrarch, s, thought, and, style, are, relatively, uniform, throughout, his, life, he, spent, much, of, it, revising, the, songs, and, sonnets, of, the, canzoniere, rather, than, moving, to, new, subjects, or, poetry, here, poetry, alone, provides, a, consolation, for, personal, grief, much, less, philosophy, or, politics, as, in, dante, for, petrarch, fights, within, himself, sensuality, versus, mysticism, profane, versus, christian, literature, not, against, anything, outside, of, himself, the, strong, moral, and, political, convictions, which, had, inspired, dante, belong, to, the, middle, ages, and, the, libertarian, spirit, of, the, commune, petrarch, s, moral, dilemmas, his, refusal, to, take, a, stand, in, politics, his, reclusive, life, point, to, a, different, direction, or, time, the, free, commune, the, place, that, had, made, dante, an, eminent, politician, and, scholar, was, being, dismantled, the, signoria, was, taking, its, place, humanism, and, its, spirit, of, empirical, inquiry, however, were, making, progress, but, the, papacy, especially, after, avignon, and, the, empire, henry, vii, the, last, hope, of, the, white, guelphs, died, near, siena, in, 1313, had, lost, much, of, their, original, prestige, petrarch,
