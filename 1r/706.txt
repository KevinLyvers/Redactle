good, hope, west, of, staten, land, near, the, cape, horn, of, south, america, and, south, of, the, solomon, islands, one, of, the, objectives, was, to, obtain, knowledge, of, all, the, totally, unknown, provinces, of, beach, this, was, a, purported, yet, non, existent, landmass, said, to, have, plentiful, gold, which, had, appeared, on, european, maps, since, the, 15th, century, as, a, result, of, an, error, in, some, editions, of, marco, polo, s, works, the, expedition, was, to, use, two, small, ships, heemskerck, and, zeehaen, in, accordance, with, visscher, s, directions, tasman, sailed, from, batavia, on, 14, august, 1642, and, arrived, at, mauritius, on, 5, september, 1642, according, to, the, captain, s, journal, the, reason, for, this, was, the, crew, could, be, fed, well, on, the, island, there, was, plenty, of, fresh, water, and, timber, to, repair, the, ships, tasman, got, the, assistance, of, the, governor, adriaan, van, der, stel, because, of, the, prevailing, winds, mauritius, was, chosen, as, a, turning, point, after, a, four, week, stay, on, the, island, both, ships, left, on, 8, october, using, the, roaring, forties, to, sail, east, as, fast, as, possible, no, one, had, gone, as, far, as, pieter, nuyts, in, 1626, 27, on, 7, november, snow, and, hail, influenced, the, ship, s, council, to, alter, course, to, a, more, north, easterly, direction,

he, named, his, discovery, van, diemen, s, land, after, antonio, van, diemen, governor, general, of, the, dutch, east, indies, proceeding, south, tasman, skirted, the, southern, end, of, tasmania, and, turned, north, east, he, then, tried, to, work, his, two, ships, into, adventure, bay, on, the, east, coast, of, south, bruny, island, but, he, was, blown, out, to, sea, by, a, storm, this, area, he, named, storm, bay, two, days, later, on, 1, december, tasman, anchored, to, the, north, of, cape, frederick, hendrick, just, north, of, the, forestier, peninsula, on, 2, december, two, ship, s, boats, under, the, command, of, the, pilot, major, visscher, rowed, through, the, marion, narrows, into, blackman, bay, and, then, west, to, the, outflow, of, boomer, creek, where, they, gathered, some, edible, greens, tasman, named, the, bay, frederick, hendrik, bay, which, included, the, present, north, bay, marion, bay, and, what, is, now, blackman, bay, tasman, s, original, naming, frederick, henrick, bay, was, mistakenly, transferred, to, its, present, location, by, marion, dufresne, in, 1772, the, next, day, an, attempt, was, made, to, land, in, north, bay, however, because, the, sea, was, too, rough, a, ship, s, carpenter, swam, through, the, surf, and, planted, the, dutch, flag, tasman, then, claimed, formal, possession, of, the, land, on, 3, december, 1642, for, two, more, days, he, continued, to, follow, the, east, coast, northward, to, see, how, far, it, went, when, the, land, veered, to, the, north, west, at, eddystone, point, he, tried, to, follow, the, coast, line, but, his, ships, were, suddenly, hit, by, the, roaring, forties, howling, through, bass, strait, tasman, was, on, a, mission, to, find, the, southern, continent, not, more, islands, so, he, abruptly, turned, away, to, the, east, and, continued, his, continent, hunting, tasman, had, intended, to, proceed, in, a, northerly, direction, but, as, the, wind, was, unfavourable, he, steered, east, the, expedition, endured, a, rough, voyage, and, in, one, of, his, diary, entries, tasman, claimed, that, his, compass, was, the, only, thing, that, had, kept, him, alive, on, 13, december, 1642, they, sighted, land, on, the, north, west, coast, of, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, sight, new, zealand, tasman, named, it, staten, landt, in, honour, of, the, states, general, dutch, parliament, he, wrote, it, is, possible, that, this, land, joins, to, the, staten, landt, but, it, is, uncertain, referring, to, isla, de, los, estados, a, landmass, of, the, same, name, at, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, encountered, by, the, dutch, navigator, jacob, le, maire, in, 1616, however, in, 1643, brouwer, s, expedition, to, valdivia, found, out, that, staaten, landt, was, separated, by, sea, from, the, hypothetical, southern, land, tasman, continued, we, believe, that, this, is, the, mainland, coast, of, the, unknown, southland, tasman, thought, he, had, found, the, western, side, of, the, long, imagined, terra, australis, that, stretched, across, the, pacific, to, near, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, after, sailing, north, then, east, for, five, days, the, expedition, anchored, about, 7, kilometres, 4, 3, mi, from, the, coast, off, what, is, now, golden, bay, a, group, of, m, ori, paddled, out, in, a, waka, canoe, and, attacked, some, sailors, who, were, rowing, between, the, two, dutch, vessels, four, sailors, were, clubbed, to, death, with, patu, in, the, evening, about, one, hour, after, sunset, we, saw, many, lights, on, land, and, four, vessels, near, the, shore, two, of, which, betook, themselves, towards, us, when, our, two, boats, returned, to, the, ships, reporting, that, they, had, found, not, less, than, thirteen, fathoms, of, water, and, with, the, sinking, of, the, sun, which, sank, behind, the, high, land, they, had, been, still, about, half, a, mile, from, the, shore, after, our, people, had, been, on, board, about, one, glass, people, in, the, two, canoes, began, to, call, out, to, us, in, gruff, hollow, voices, we, could, not, in, the, least, understand, any, of, it, however, when, they, called, out, again, several, times, we, called, back, to, them, as, a, token, answer, but, they, did, not, come, nearer, than, a, stone, s, shot, they, also, blew, many, times, on, an, instrument, which, produced, a, sound, like, the, moors, trumpets, we, had, one, of, our, sailors, who, could, play, somewhat, on, the, trumpet, play, some, tunes, to, them, in, answer, as, tasman, sailed, out, of, the, bay, he, observed, 22, waka, near, the, shore, of, which, eleven, swarming, with, people, came, off, towards, us, the, waka, approached, the, zeehaen, which, fired, and, hit, a, man, in, the, largest, waka, holding, a, small, white, flag, canister, shot, also, hit, the, side, of, a, waka, archaeologist, ian, barber, suggests, that, local, maori, were, trying, to, secure, a, cultivation, field, under, ritual, protection, tapu, where, they, believed, the, dutch, were, attempting, to, land, as, the, month, of, this, contact, december, was, at, the, mid, point, of, the, locally, important, sweetpotato, k, mara, ipomoea, batatas, growing, season, tasman, named, the, area, murderers, bay, the, expedition, then, sailed, north, sighting, cook, strait, which, separates, the, north, and, south, islands, of, new, zealand, and, which, it, mistook, for, a, bight, and, named, zeehaen, s, bight, two, names, that, the, expedition, gave, to, landmarks, in, the, far, north, of, new, zealand, still, endure, cape, maria, van, diemen, and, three, kings, islands, kaap, pieter, boreels, was, renamed, cape, egmont, by, captain, james, cook, 125, years, later, en, route, back, to, batavia, tasman, came, across, the, tongan, archipelago, on, 20, january, 1643, while, passing, the, fiji, islands, tasman, s, ships, came, close, to, being, wrecked, on, the, dangerous, reefs, of, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, fiji, group, he, charted, the, eastern, tip, of, vanua, levu, and, cikobia, i, lau, before, making, his, way, back, into, the, open, sea, the, expedition, turned, north, west, towards, new, guinea, and, arrived, back, in, batavia, on, 15, june, 1643, tasman, left, batavia, on, 30, january, 1644, on, his, second, voyage, with, three, ships, limmen, zeemeeuw, and, the, tender, braek, he, followed, the, south, coast, of, new, guinea, eastwards, in, an, attempt, to, find, a, passage, to, the, eastern, side, of, new, holland, however, he, missed, the, torres, strait, between, new, guinea, and, australia, probably, due, to, the, numerous, reefs, and, islands, obscuring, potential, routes, and, continued, his, voyage, by, following, the, shore, of, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, westwards, along, the, north, australian, coast, he, mapped, the, north, coast, of, australia, making, observations, on, new, holland, and, its, people, he, arrived, back, in, batavia, in, august, 1644, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, tasman, s, explorations, were, a, disappointment, he, had, neither, found, a, promising, area, for, trade, nor, a, useful, new, shipping, route, although, tasman, was, received, courteously, on, his, return, the, company, was, upset, that, tasman, had, not, fully, explored, the, lands, he, found, and, decided, that, a, more, persistent, explorer, should, be, chosen, for, any, future, expeditions, for, over, a, century, until, the, era, of, james, cook, tasmania, and, new, zealand, were, not, visited, by, europeans, mainland, australia, was, visited, but, usually, only, by, accident, on, 2, november, 1644, abel, tasman, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, council, of, justice, in, batavia, he, went, to, sumatra, in, 1646, and, in, august, 1647, to, siam, now, thailand, with, letters, from, the, company, to, the, king, in, may, 1648, he, was, in, charge, of, an, expedition, sent, to, manila, to, try, to, intercept, and, loot, the, spanish, silver, ships, coming, from, america, but, he, had, no, success, and, returned, to, batavia, in, january, 1649, in, november, 1649, he, was, charged, and, found, guilty, of, having, in, the, previous, year, hanged, one, of, his, men, without, trial, was, suspended, from, his, office, of, commander, fined, and, made, to, pay, compensation, to, the, relatives, of, the, sailor, on, 5, january, 1651, he, was, formally, reinstated, in, his, rank, and, spent, his, remaining, years, at, batavia, he, was, in, good, circumstances, being, one, of, the, larger, landowners, in, the, town, he, died, at, batavia, on, 10, october, 1659, and, was, survived, by, his, second, wife, and, a, daughter, by, his, first, wife, his, property, was, divided, between, his, wife, and, his, daughter, in, his, will, dating, from, 1657, he, left, 25, guilders, to, the, poor, of, his, village, lutjegast, although, tasman, s, pilot, frans, visscher, published, memoir, concerning, the, discovery, of, the, south, land, in, 1642, tasman, s, detailed, journal, was, not, published, until, 1898, nevertheless, some, of, his, charts, and, maps, were, in, general, circulation, and, used, by, subsequent, explorers, the, journal, signed, by, abel, tasman, of, the, 1642, voyage, is, held, in, the, dutch, national, archives, at, the, hague, tasman, s, ten, month, voyage, in, 1642, 43, had, significant, consequences, by, circumnavigating, australia, albeit, at, a, distance, tasman, proved, that, the, small, fifth, continent, was, not, joined, to, any, larger, sixth, continent, such, as, the, long, imagined, southern, continent, further, tasman, s, suggestion, that, new, zealand, was, the, western, side, of, that, southern, continent, was, seized, upon, by, many, european, cartographers, who, for, the, next, century, depicted, new, zealand, as, the, west, coast, of, a, terra, australis, rising, gradually, from, the, waters, around, tierra, del, fuego, this, theory, was, eventually, disproved, when, captain, cook, circumnavigated, new, zealand, in, 1769, multiple, places, have, been, named, after, tasman, including, also, named, after, tasman, are, his, portrait, has, been, on, four, new, zealand, postage, stamp, issues, on, a, 1992, 5, nzd, coin, and, on, 1963, 1966, and, 1985, australian, postage, stamps, in, the, netherlands, many, streets, are, named, after, him, in, lutjegast, the, village, where, he, was, born, there, is, a, museum, dedicated, to, his, life, and, travels, tasman, s, life, was, dramatised, for, radio, in, early, in, the, morning, 1946, a, play, by, ruth, park, a, drawing, titled, abel, janssen, tasman, navigateur, en, australie, is, held, by, the, state, library, of, new, south, wales, as, part, of, a, portfolio, of, 26, ink, drawings, of, 16th, and, 17th, century, dutch, admirals, navigators, and, governor, generals, of, the, voc, the, portfolio, was, acquired, at, an, art, auction, in, the, hague, in, 1862, however, it, is, unclear, if, the, drawing, is, of, tasman, and, its, original, source, is, unknown, although, it, has, been, said, to, resemble, the, work, of, dutch, engraver, jacobus, houbraken, the, drawing, has, been, assessed, as, having, the, most, reliable, provenance, of, any, depiction, of, tasman, with, no, strong, reason, to, doubt, that, the, drawing, is, not, genuine, in, 1948, the, national, library, of, australia, acquired, from, rex, nan, kivell, a, portrait, purporting, to, depict, tasman, with, his, wife, and, stepdaughter, which, was, attributed, to, jacob, gerritsz, cuyp, and, dated, to, 1637, in, 2018, the, painting, was, exhibited, by, the, groninger, museum, in, the, netherlands, which, identified, it, as, the, only, known, portrait, of, the, explorer, however, the, netherlands, institute, for, art, history, has, instead, attributed, the, painting, to, dirck, van, santvoort, and, concluded, that, the, painting, does, not, depict, tasman, and, his, family, the, provenance, provided, from, nan, kivell, for, the, family, portrait, has, been, unable, to, be, verified, nan, kivell, claimed, that, the, portrait, was, passed, down, through, the, springer, family, relatives, of, tasman, s, widow, and, was, sold, at, christie, s, in, 1877, however, christie, s, records, indicate, that, the, portrait, was, not, owned, by, the, springer, family, or, associated, with, tasman, and, was, instead, sold, as, portrait, of, an, astronomer, by, anthonie, palamedes, nan, kivell, additionally, claimed, that, the, portrait, was, sold, at, christie, s, a, second, time, in, 1941, however, no, records, exist, to, support, this, a, survey, of, portraits, of, tasman, published, in, 2019, concluded, that, the, provenance, was, either, invented, by, rex, nan, kivell, or, by, the, unnamed, art, dealer, who, sold, it, to, rex, nan, kivell, and, that, the, painting, should, therefore, not, be, considered, a, portrait, of, abel, tasman, s, family, outside, of, the, nan, kivell, painting, another, purported, portrait, of, tasman, was, discovered, in, 1893, and, eventually, acquired, by, the, tasmanian, government, in, 1976, for, the, tasmanian, museum, and, art, gallery, tmag, the, painting, is, unsigned, and, was, attributed, to, bartholomeus, van, der, helst, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, but, this, attribution, was, disputed, by, dutch, art, historian, cornelis, hofstede, de, groot, and, alec, martin, of, christie, s, in, 1985, tmag, curator, dan, gregg, stated, that, the, painter, of, the, life, sized, portrait, is, unknown, there, is, some, uncertainty, as, to, whether, the, portrait, is, really, of, tasman, held, within, the, collection, of, the, state, library, of, new, south, wales, is, the, tasman, map, thought, to, have, been, drawn, by, isaac, gilsemans, or, completed, under, the, supervision, of, franz, jacobszoon, visscher, the, map, is, also, known, as, the, bonaparte, map, as, it, was, once, owned, by, prince, roland, bonaparte, the, great, nephew, of, napoleon, the, map, was, completed, sometime, after, 1644, and, is, based, on, the, original, charts, drawn, during, tasman, s, first, and, second, voyages, as, none, of, the, journals, or, logs, composed, during, tasman, s, second, voyage, have, survived, the, bonaparte, map, remains, as, an, important, contemporary, artefact, of, tasman, s, voyage, to, the, northern, coast, of, the, australian, continent, the, tasman, map, reveals, the, extent, of, understanding, the, dutch, had, of, the, australian, continent, at, the, time, the, map, includes, the, western, and, southern, coasts, of, australia, accidentally, encountered, by, dutch, voyagers, as, they, journeyed, by, way, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, to, the, voc, headquarters, in, batavia, in, addition, the, map, shows, the, tracks, of, tasman, s, two, voyages, of, his, second, voyage, the, map, shows, the, banda, islands, the, southern, coast, of, new, guinea, and, much, of, the, northern, coast, of, australia, however, the, land, areas, adjacent, to, the, torres, strait, are, shown, unexamined, this, is, despite, tasman, having, been, given, orders, by, voc, council, at, batavia, to, explore, the, possibility, of, a, channel, between, new, guinea, and, the, australian, continent, there, is, debate, as, to, the, origin, of, the, map, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, map, was, produced, in, batavia, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, map, was, produced, in, amsterdam, the, authorship, of, the, map, has, also, been, debated, while, the, map, is, commonly, attributed, to, tasman, it, is, now, thought, to, have, been, the, result, of, a, collaboration, probably, involving, franchoijs, visscher, and, isaack, gilsemans, who, took, part, in, both, of, tasman, s, voyages, whether, the, map, was, produced, in, 1644, is, also, subject, to, debate, as, a, voc, company, report, in, december, 1644, suggested, that, at, that, time, no, maps, showing, tasman, s, voyages, were, yet, complete, in, 1943, a, mosaic, version, of, the, map, composed, of, coloured, brass, and, marble, was, inlaid, into, the, vestibule, floor, of, the, mitchell, library, in, sydney, the, work, was, commissioned, by, the, principal, librarian, william, ifould, and, completed, by, the, melocco, brothers, of, annandale, who, also, worked, on, anzac, war, memorial, in, hyde, park, and, the, crypt, at, st, mary, s, cathedral, sydney
