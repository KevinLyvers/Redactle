and, the, grandson, of, publius, cornelius, sulla, was, born, into, a, branch, of, the, patrician, gens, cornelia, but, his, family, had, fallen, to, an, impoverished, condition, at, the, time, of, his, birth, publius, cornelius, rufinus, one, of, sulla, s, ancestors, and, also, the, last, member, of, his, family, to, be, consul, was, banished, from, the, senate, after, having, been, caught,

praetor, but, details, are, unclear, his, father, married, twice, and, sulla, s, stepmother, was, of, considerable, wealth, which, certainly, helped, the, young, sulla, s, ambitions, one, story, as, false, as, it, is, charming, relates, that, when, sulla, was, a, baby, his, nurse, was, carrying, him, around, the, streets, until, a, strange, woman, walked, up, to, her, and, said, puer, tibi, et, reipublicae, tuae, felix, which, can, be, translated, as, the, boy, will, be, a, source, of, luck, to, you, and, your, state, after, his, father, s, death, around, the, time, sulla, reached, adulthood, sulla, found, himself, impoverished, he, might, have, been, disinherited, though, it, was, more, likely, that, his, father, simply, had, nothing, to, bequeath, lacking, ready, money, sulla, spent, his, youth, among, rome, s, comedians, actors, lute, players, and, dancers, during, these, times, on, the, stage, after, initially, only, singing, he, started, writing, plays, atellan, farces,

night, and, day, sulla, almost, certainly, received, a, normal, education, for, his, class, grounded, in, ancient, greek, and, latin, classics, sallust, declares, him, well, read, intelligent, and, he, was, fluent, in, greek, regardless, by, the, standards, of, the, roman, political, class, sulla, was, a, very, poor, man, his, first, wife, was, called, either, ilia, or, julia, if, the, latter, he, may, have, married, into, the, julii, caesares, he, had, one, child, from, this, union, before, his, first, wife, s, death, he, married, again, with, a, woman, called, aelia, of, whom, nothing, is, known, other, than, her, name, during, these, marriages, he, engaged, in, an, affair, with, the, hetaira, nicopolis, who, also, was, older, than, he, the, means, by, which, sulla, attained, the, fortune, which, later, would, enable, him, to, ascend, the, ladder, of, roman, politics, are, not, clear, plutarch, refers, to, two, inheritances, one, from, his, stepmother, who, loved, him, dearly, and, the, other, from, his, mistress, nicopolis, keaveney, 2005, pp, 10, 11, accepts, these, inheritances, without, much, comment, and, places, them, around, sulla, s, turning, thirty, years, of, age, after, meeting, the, minimum, age, requirement, of, thirty, he, stood, for, the, quaestorship, in, 108, bc, normally, candidates, had, to, have, first, served, for, ten, years, in, the, military, but, by, sulla, s, time, this, had, been, superseded, by, an, age, requirement, he, was, then, assigned, by, lot, to, serve, under, the, consul, gaius, marius, the, jugurthine, war, had, started, in, 112, bc, when, jugurtha, grandson, of, massinissa, of, numidia, claimed, the, entire, kingdom, of, numidia, in, defiance, of, roman, decrees, that, divided, it, among, several, members, of, the, royal, family, after, the, massacre, of, a, number, of, italian, traders, who, supported, one, of, his, rivals, indignation, erupted, as, to, jugurtha, s, use, of, bribery, to, secure, a, favourable, peace, treaty, called, to, rome, to, testify, on, bribery, charges, he, plotted, successfully, the, assassination, of, another, royal, claimant, before, returning, home, after, the, war, started, several,

lieutenant, of, metellus, returned, to, rome, to, stand, for, the, consulship, in, 107, bc, marius, was, elected, consul, and, through, assignment, by, tribunician, legislation, took, over, the, campaign, sulla, was, assigned, by, lot, to, his, staff, when, marius, took, over, the, war, he, entrusted, sulla, to, organise, cavalry, forces, in, italy, needed, to, pursue, the, mobile, numidians, into, the, desert, if, sulla, had, married, one, of, the, julii, caesares, this, could, explain, marius, willingness, to, entrust, such, an, important, task, to, a, young, man, with, no, military, experience, as, marius, too, had, married, into, that, family, under, marius, the, roman, forces, followed, a, plan, very, similar, to, that, of, metellus, capturing, and, garrisoning, fortified, positions, in, the, african, countryside, sulla, was, popular, with, the, men, charming, and, benign, he, built, up, a, healthy, rapport, while, also, winning, popularity, with, other, officers, including, marius, ultimately, the, numidians, were, defeated, in, 106, bc, due, in, large, part, to, sulla, s, initiative, in, capturing, the, numidian, king, jugurtha, had, fled, to, his, father, in, law, king, bocchus, i, of, mauretania, a, nearby, kingdom, marius, invaded, mauretania, and, after, a, pitched, battle, in, which, both, sulla, and, marius, played, important, roles, in, securing, victory, bocchus, felt, forced, by, roman, arms, to, betray, jugurtha, after, the, senate, approved, negotiations, with, bocchus, it, delegated, the, talks, to, marius, who, appointed, sulla, as, envoy, plenipotentiary, winning, bocchus, friendship, and, making, plain, rome, s, demands, for, jugurtha, s, deliverance, sulla, successfully, concluded, negotiations, and, secured, bocchus, capture, of, jugurtha, and, the, king, s, rendition, to, marius, camp, the, publicity, attracted, by, this, feat, boosted, sulla, s, political, career, years, later, in, 91, bc, bocchus, paid, for, the, erection, of, a, gilded, equestrian, statue, depicting, sulla, s, capture, of, jugurtha, in, 104, bc, the, cimbri, and, the, teutones, two, germanic, tribes, who, had, bested, the, roman, legions, on, several, occasions, seemed, again, to, be, heading, for, italy, marius, in, the, midst, of, this, military, crisis, sought, and, won, repeated, consulships, which, upset, aristocrats, in, the, senate, it, is, likely, however, that, they, acknowledged, the, indispensability, of, marius, military, capabilities, in, defeating, the, germanic, invaders, amid, a, reorganisation, of, political, alliances, the, traditionalists, in, the, senate, raised, up, sulla, a, patrician, even, if, a, poor, one, as, a, counterweight, against, the, newcomer, marius, starting, in, 104, bc, marius, moved, to, reform, the, defeated, roman, armies, in, southern, gaul, sulla, then, served, as, legate, under, his, former, commander, and, in, that, stead, successfully, subdued, a, gallic, tribe, which, revolted, in, the, aftermath, of, a, previous, roman, defeat, the, next, year, sulla, was, elected, military, tribune, and, served, under, marius, and, assigned, to, treat, with, the, marsi, part, of, the, germanic, invaders, he, was, able, to, negotiate, their, defection, from, the, cimbri, and, teutones, his, prospects, for, advancement, under, marius, being, stalled, however, sulla, started, to, complain, most, unfairly, that, marius, was, withholding, opportunities, from, him, demanding, transfer, to, catulus, marius, consular, colleague, army, he, received, it, in, 102, bc, the, invaders, returned, and, moved, to, force, the, alps, catulus, with, sulla, moved, to, block, their, advance, the, two, men, likely, cooperated, well, but, catulus, army, was, defeated, in, the, eastern, alps, and, withdrew, from, venetia, and, thence, to, the, southern, side, of, the, river, po, at, the, same, time, marius, had, annihilated, the, cimbri, s, allies, the, teutones, at, the, battle, of, aquae, sextiae, marius, elected, again, to, the, consulship, of, 101, came, to, catulus, aid, sulla, in, charge, of, supporting, army, provisioning, did, so, competently, and, was, able, to, feed, both, armies, the, two, armies, then, crossed, the, po, and, attacked, the, cimbri, after, the, failure, of, negotiations, the, romans, and, cimbri, engaged, in, the, battle, of, the, raudian, field, in, which, the, cimbri, were, routed, and, destroyed, victorious, marius, and, catulus, were, both, granted, triumphs, as, the, commanding, generals, refusing, to, stand, for, an, aedileship, which, due, to, its, involvement, in, hosting, public, games, was, extremely, expensive, sulla, became, a, candidate, for, the, praetorship, in, 99, bc, he, was, however, defeated, in, memoirs, related, via, plutarch, he, claimed, this, was, because, the, people, demanded, that, he, first, stand, for, the, aedilate, so, due, to, his, friendship, with, bocchus, a, rich, foreign, monarch, he, might, spend, money, on, games, whether, this, story, of, sulla, s, defeat, is, true, is, unclear, regardless, sulla, stood, for, the, praetorship, again, the, next, year, and, promising, he, would, pay, for, good, shows, was, elected, praetor, for, 97, bc, he, was, assigned, by, lot, to, the, urban, praetorship, his, term, as, praetor, was, largely, uneventful, excepting, a, public, dispute, with, gaius, julius, caesar, strabo, possibly, his, brother, in, law, and, his, magnificent, holding, of, the, ludi, apollinares, the, next, year, 96, bc, he, was, assigned, probably, pro, consule, as, was, customary, to, cilicia, in, asia, minor, while, governing, cilicia, sulla, received, orders, from, the, senate, to, restore, ariobarzanes, to, the, throne, of, cappadocia, ariobarzanes, had, been, driven, out, by, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, who, wanted, to, install, one, of, his, own, sons, ariarathes, on, the, cappadocian, throne, despite, initial, difficulties, sulla, was, successful, with, minimal, resources, and, preparation, with, few, roman, troops, he, hastily, levied, allied, soldiers, and, advanced, quickly, into, rugged, terrain, before, routing, superior, enemy, forces, his, troops, were, sufficiently, impressed, by, his, leadership, that, they, hailed, him, imperator, sulla, s, campaign, in, cappadocia, had, led, him, to, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, where, he, was, approached, by, an, embassy, from, the, parthian, empire, sulla, was, the, first, roman, magistrate, to, meet, a, parthian, ambassador, at, the, meeting, he, took, the, seat, between, the, parthian, ambassador, orobazus, and, ariobarzanes, seeking, to, gain, psychological, advantage, over, the, parthian, envoy, by, portraying, the, parthians, and, the, cappadocians, as, equals, with, rome, being, superior, the, parthian, ambassador, orobazus, was, executed, upon, his, return, to, parthia, for, allowing, this, humiliation, the, parthians, however, ratified, the, treaty, reached, which, established, the, euphrates, as, a, clear, boundary, between, parthia, and, rome, at, this, meeting, sulla, was, told, by, a, chaldean, seer, that, he, would, die, at, the, height, of, his, fame, and, fortune, this, prophecy, was, to, have, a, powerful, hold, on, sulla, throughout, his, lifetime, in, 94, bc, sulla, repulsed, the, forces, of, tigranes, the, great, of, armenia, from, cappadocia, he, may, have, stayed, in, the, east, until, 92, bc, when, he, returned, to, rome, keaveney, places, his, departure, in, the, year, 93bc, sulla, was, regarded, to, have, done, well, in, the, east, he, had, restored, ariobarzanes, to, the, throne, been, hailed, imperator, by, his, men, and, was, the, first, roman, to, treat, successfully, with, the, parthians, with, military, and, diplomatic, victory, his, political, fortunes, seemed, positive, however, his, candidature, was, dealt, a, blow, when, he, was, brought, up, on, charges, of, extorting, ariobarzanes, even, though, the, prosecutor, declined, to, show, up, on, the, day, of, the, trial, leading, to, sulla, s, victory, by, default, sulla, s, ambitions, were, frustrated, relations, between, rome, and, its, allies, the, socii, had, deteriorated, over, the, years, up, to, 91, bc, from, 133, bc, and, the, start, of, tiberius, gracchus, land, reforms, italian, communities, were, displaced, from, de, jure, roman, public, lands, over, which, no, title, had, been, enforced, for, generations, various, proposals, to, give, the, allies, roman, citizenship, over, the, decades, had, failed, for, various, reasons, just, as, the, allies, also, became, progressively, more, aware, of, the, need, to, cease, to, be, subjects, and, to, share, in, the, exercise, of, imperial, power, by, acquiring, that, citizenship, the, cimbric, war, also, revived, italian, solidarity, aided, by, roman, extension, of, corruption, laws, to, allow, allies, to, lodge, extortion, claims, when, the, pro, italian, plebeian, tribune, marcus, livius, drusus, was, assassinated, in, 91, bc, while, trying, again, to, pass, a, bill, extending, roman, citizenship, the, italians, revolted, the, same, year, bocchus, paid, for, the, erection, of, a, statue, depicting, sulla, s, capture, of, jugurtha, this, may, have, been, related, to, sulla, s, campaign, for, the, consulship, regardless, if, he, had, immediate, plans, for, a, consulship, they, were, forced, into, the, background, at, the, outbreak, of, war, at, the, start, of, the, war, there, were, largely, two, theatres, a, northern, theatre, from, picenum, to, the, fucine, lake, and, a, southern, theatre, including, samnium, sulla, served, as, one, of, the, legates, in, the, southern, theatre, assigned, to, consul, lucius, julius, caesar, in, the, first, year, of, fighting, roman, strategy, was, largely, one, of, containment, attempting, to, stop, the, revolting, allies, from, spreading, their, rebellion, into, roman, controlled, territory, sulla, in, southern, italy, operated, largely, defensively, on, lucius, julius, caesar, s, flank, while, the, consul, conducted, offensive, campaigning, late, in, the, year, sulla, cooperated, with, marius, who, was, a, legate, in, the, northern, theatre, in, the, northern, part, of, southern, italy, to, defeat, the, marsi, marius, defeated, the, marsi, sending, them, headlong, into, sulla, s, waiting, forces, sulla, attempted, also, to, assist, lucius, relief, of, the, city, of, aesernia, which, was, under, siege, but, both, men, were, unsuccessful, the, next, year, 89, bc, sulla, served, as, legate, under, the, consul, lucius, porcius, cato, but, after, cato, s, death, in, battle, with, the, marsi, sulla, was, prorogued, pro, consule, and, placed, in, supreme, command, of, the, southern, theatre, he, brought, pompeii, under, siege, after, one, of, the, other, legates, was, killed, by, his, men, sulla, refused, to, discipline, them, except, by, issuing, a, proclamation, imploring, them, to, show, more, courage, against, the, enemy, while, besieging, pompeii, an, italian, relief, force, came, under, lucius, cluentius, which, sulla, defeated, and, forced, into, flight, towards, nola, killing, cluentius, before, the, city, s, walls, sulla, then, invested, the, town, and, for, his, efforts, was, awarded, a, grass, crown, the, highest, roman, military, honour, pompeii, was, taken, some, time, during, the, year, along, with, stabiae, and, aeclanum, with, the, capture, of, aeclanum, sulla, forced, the, hirpini, to, surrender, he, then, attacked, the, samnites, and, routed, one, of, their, armies, near, aesernia, before, capturing, the, new, italian, capital, at, bovianum, undecimanorum, all, of, these, victories, would, have, been, won, before, the, consular, elections, in, october, 89, political, developments, in, rome, also, started, to, bring, an, end, to, the, war, in, 89, bc, one, of, the, tribunes, of, the, plebs, passed, the, lex, plautia, papiria, which, granted, citizenship, to, all, of, the, allies, with, exception, for, the, samnites, and, lucanians, still, under, arms, this, had, been, preceded, by, the, lex, julia, passed, by, lucius, julius, caesar, in, october, 90, bc, which, had, granted, citizenship, to, those, allies, who, remained, loyal, buttressed, by, success, against, rome, s, traditional, enemies, the, samnites, and, general, roman, victory, across, italy, sulla, stood, for, and, was, elected, easily, to, the, consulship, of, 88, bc, his, colleague, would, be, quintus, pompeius, rufus, sulla, s, election, to, the, consulship, successful, likely, due, to, his, military, success, in, 89, bc, was, not, uncontested, gaius, julius, caesar, strabo, merely, an, ex, aedile, and, one, of, sulla, s, long, time, enemies, had, contested, the, top, magistracy, beyond, personal, enmity, caesar, strabo, may, also, have, stood, for, office, because, it, was, evident, that, rome, s, relations, with, the, pontic, king, mithridates, vi, eupator, were, deteriorating, and, that, the, consuls, of, 88, would, be, assigned, an, extremely, lucrative, and, glorious, command, against, pontus, pompey, strabo, may, have, coveted, a, second, consulship, for, similar, reasons, the, question, as, to, whom, to, send, against, mithridates, would, be, one, of, the, sources, of, the, following, domestic, crisis, shortly, after, sulla, s, election, probably, in, the, last, weeks, of, the, year, sulla, married, his, daughter, to, one, of, his, colleague, pompeius, rufus, sons, he, also, divorced, his, then, wife, cloelia, and, married, metella, widow, of, the, recently, deceased, marcus, aemilius, scaurus, these, marriages, helped, build, political, alliances, with, the, influential, caecilii, metelli, and, the, pompeys, he, was, also, assigned, by, the, senate, probably, with, the, support, of, his, consular, colleague, quintus, pompeius, rufus, the, mithridatic, command, sulla, became, embroiled, in, a, political, fight, against, one, of, the, plebeian, tribunes, publius, sulpicius, rufus, on, the, matter, of, how, the, new, italian, citizens, were, to, be, distributed, into, the, roman, tribes, for, purposes, of, voting, sulla, and, pompeius, rufus, opposed, the, bill, which, sulpicius, took, as, a, betrayal, sulpicius, without, the, support, of, the, consuls, looked, elsewhere, for, political, allies, this, led, him, to, a, secret, deal, with, marius, who, had, for, years, been, coveting, another, military, command, according, to, which, marius, would, support, sulpicius, italian, legislation, in, exchange, for, a, law, transferring, sulla, s, command, to, marius, sulpicius, attempts, to, push, through, the, italian, legislation, again, brought, him, into, violent, urban, conflict, although, he, offered, nothing, to, the, urban, plebs, so, it, continued, to, resist, him, the, consuls, fearful, of, intimidation, of, sulpicius, and, his, armed, bodyguards, declared, a, suspension, of, public, business, iustitium, which, led, to, sulpicius, and, his, mob, forcing, the, consuls, to, flee, during, the, violence, sulla, was, forced, to, shelter, in, marius, nearby, house, later, denied, in, his, memoirs, marius, arranged, for, sulla, to, lift, the, iustitium, and, allow, sulpicius, to, bring, proposals, sulla, in, a, desperately, weak, position, little, in, return, perhaps, no, more, than, a, promise, that, sulla, s, life, would, be, safe, sulla, then, left, for, capua, before, joining, an, army, near, nola, in, southern, italy, he, may, have, felt, after, this, political, humiliation, that, the, only, way, to, recover, his, career, was, to, come, back, from, the, mithridatic, command, victorious, with, sulpicius, able, to, enact, legislation, without, consular, opposition, sulla, discovered, that, marius, had, tricked, him, for, the, first, piece, of, legislation, sulpicius, brought, was, a, law, transferring, the, command, against, mithridates, to, marius, thus, sulla, was, presented, with, a, choice, he, could, acknowledge, the, law, as, valid, to, do, so, would, mean, total, humiliation, at, the, hands, of, his, opponents, the, end, of, his, political, career, and, perhaps, even, further, danger, to, his, life, or, he, could, attempt, to, reverse, it, and, regain, his, command, he, can, hardly, have, been, in, any, doubt, like, caesar, he, was, an, outsider, in, politics, totally, self, centred, in, pursuit, of, his, ambitions, always, ready, to, break, the, rules, of, the, political, game, to, achieve, his, objective, if, sulla, hesitated, it, can, only, have, been, because, he, was, not, sure, how, his, army, would, react, speaking, to, the, men, sulla, complained, to, them, of, the, outrageous, behaviour, of, marius, and, sulpicius, he, hinted, to, them, that, marius, would, find, other, men, to, fight, mithridates, forcing, them, to, give, up, opportunities, to, plunder, the, east, claims, which, were, surely, false, the, troops, were, willing, to, follow, sulla, to, rome, his, officers, however, realised, sulla, s, plans, and, deserted, him, except, his, quaestor, and, kinsman, almost, certainly, lucius, licinius, lucullus, they, then, killed, marcus, gratidius, one, of, marius, legates, when, gratidius, attempted, to, effect, the, transfer, of, command, when, the, march, on, rome, started, the, senate, and, people, were, appalled, the, senate, immediately, sent, an, embassy, demanding, an, explanation, for, his, seeming, march, on, the, fatherland, to, which, sulla, responded, boldly, saying, that, he, was, freeing, it, from, tyrants, rome, having, no, troops, to, defend, itself, sulla, entered, the, city, once, there, however, his, men, were, pelted, with, stones, from, the, rooftops, by, common, people, almost, breaking, before, marius, makeshift, forces, sulla, then, stationed, troops, all, over, the, city, before, summoning, the, senate, and, inducing, it, to, outlaw, marius, marius, son, sulpicius, and, nine, others, he, then, reinforced, this, decision, by, legislation, retroactively, justifying, his, illegal, march, on, the, city, and, stripping, the, twelve, outlaws, of, their, roman, citizenship, of, the, twelve, outlaws, only, sulpicius, was, killed, after, being, betrayed, by, a, slave, marius, and, his, son, along, with, some, others, escaped,

strengthen, the, senate, s, position, in, the, state, and, weaken, the, plebeian, tribunes, by, eliminating, the, comitia, tributa, as, a, legislative, body, and, requiring, that, tribunes, first, receive, senatorial, approval, for, legislation, some, scholars, however, reject, appian, s, account, as, mere, retrojection, of, legislation, passed, during, sulla, s, dictatorship, he, sent, his,

allegedly, escaped, with, only, 10, 000, after, the, battle, of, chaeronea, sulla, learnt, that, cinna, s, government, had, sent, lucius, valerius, flaccus, to, take, over, his, command, sulla, had, officially, been, declared, an, outlaw, and, in, the, eyes, of, the, cinnan, regime, flaccus, was, to, take, command, of, an, army, without, a, legal, commander, sulla, moved, to, intercept, flaccus, army, in, thessaly, but, turned, around, when, pontic, forces, reoccupied, boetia, turning, south, he, engaged, the, pontic, army, allegedly, 90, 000, on, the, plain, of, orchomenus, his, troops, prepared, the, ground, by, starting, to, dig, a, series, of, three, trenches, which, successfully, contained, pontic, cavalry, when, the, pontic, cavalry, attacked, to, interrupt, the, earthworks,

unsuccessful, sulla, then, annihilated, the, pontic, army, and, captured, its, camp, archelaus, then, hid, in, the, nearby, marshes, before, escaping, to, chalcis, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, sulla, was, approached, by, archelaus, for, terms, with, mithridates, armies, in, europe, almost, entirely, destroyed, archelaus, and, sulla, negotiated, a, set, of, relatively, cordial, peace, terms, which, were, then, forwarded, to, mithridates, mithridates, was, to, give, asia, and, paphlagonia, back, to, rome, he, was, to, return, the, kingdoms, of, bithynia, and, cappadocia, to, nicomedes, and, ariobarzanes, respectively, mithridates, would, also, equip, sulla, with, seventy, or, eighty, ships, and, pay, a, war, indemnity, of, two, or, three, thousand, talents, sulla, would, ratify, mithridates, position, in, pontus, and, have, him, declared, a, roman, ally, mithridates, still, in, asia, was, faced, with, local, uprisings, against, his, rule, adding, to, his, challenges, was, lucullus, fleet, reinforced, by, rhodian, allies, when, flaccus, consular, army, marched, through, macedonia, towards, thrace, his, command, was, usurped, by, his, legate, gaius, flavius, fimbria,

mithridates, eventually, met, with, sulla, at, dardanus, in, autumn, 85, bc, and, accepted, the, terms, negotiated, by, archelaus, after, peace, was, reached, sulla, advanced, on, fimbria, s, forces, which, deserted, their, upstart, commander, fimbria, then, committed, suicide, after, a, failed, attempt, on, sulla, s, life, sulla, then, settled, affairs, reparations, rewards, administrative, and, financial, arrangements, for, the, future, in, asia, staying, there, until, 84, bc, he, then, sailed, for, italy, at, the, head, of, 1, 200, ships, the, peace, reached, with, mithridates, was, condemned, in, ancient, times, as, a, betrayal, of, roman, interests, in, favour, of, sulla, s, private, interest, in, fighting, and, winning, the, coming, civil, war, modern, sources, have, been, somewhat, less, damning, as, the, mithridatic, campaigns, later, showed, that, no, quick, victory, over, pontus, was, possible, as, long, as, mithridates, survived, however, this, and, sulla, s, delay, in, asia, are, not, enough, to, absolve, him, of, the, charge, of, being, more, concerned, with, revenge, on, opponents, in, italy, than, with, mithridates, the, extra, time, spent, in, asia, moreover, equipped, him, with, forces, and, money, later, put, to, good, use, in, italy, sulla, crossed, the, adriatic, for, brundisium, in, spring, of, 83, bc, with, five, legions, of, mithridatic, veterans, capturing, brundisium, without, a, fight, sulla, s, arrival, in, brundisium, induced, defections, from, the, senate, in, rome, marcus, licinius, crassus, who, had, already, fled, from, the, cinnan, regime, raised, an, army, in, spain, and, departed, for, africa, to, join, with, metellus, pius, who, also, joined, the, sullans, joined, sulla, even, before, his, landing, in, italy, pompey, the, son, of, pompey, strabo, raised, a, legion, from, his, clients, in, picenum, and, also, joined, sulla, sulla, treated, him, with, great, respect, and, addressed, him, as, imperator, before, dispatching, him, to, raise, more, troops, even, those, whom, sulla, had, quarrelled, with, including, publius, cornelius, cethegus, whom, sulla, had, outlawed, in, 88, bc, defected, to, join, his, side, the, general, feeling, in, italy, however, was, decidedly, anti, sullan, many, people, feared, sulla, s, wrath, and, still, held, memories, of, his, extremely, unpopular, occupation, of, rome, during, his, consulship, the, senate, moved, the, senatus, consultum, ultimum, against, him, and, was, successful, in, levying, large, amount, of, men, and, materiel, from, the, italians, sulla, buoyed, by, his, previous, looting, in, asia, was, able, to, advance, quickly, and, largely, without, the, ransacking, of, the, italian, countryside, advancing, on, capua, he, met, the, two, consuls, of, that, year, lucius, cornelius, scipio, asiaticus, and, gaius, norbanus, who, had, dangerously, divided, their, forces, he, defeated, norbanus, at, the, battle, of, mount, tifata, forcing, the, consul, to, withdraw, continuing, towards, scipio, s, position, at, teanum, sidicinum, sulla, negotiated, and, was, almost, able, to, convince, scipio, to, defect, negotiations, broke, down, after, one, of, scipio, s, lieutenants, seized, a, town, held, by, sulla, in, violation, of, a, ceasefire, the, breakdown, allowed, sulla, to, play, the, aggrieved, party, and, place, blame, on, his, enemies, for, any, further, bloodshed, scipio, s, army, blamed, him, for, the, breakdown, in, negotiations, and, made, it, clear, to, the, consul, that, they, would, not, fight, sulla, who, at, this, point, appeared, the, peacemaker, sulla, hearing, this, feigned, an, attack, while, instructing, his, men, to, fraternise, with, scipio, s, army, scipio, s, men, quickly, abandoned, him, for, sulla, finding, him, almost, alone, in, his, camp, sulla, tried, again, to, persuade, scipio, to, defect, when, scipio, refused, sulla, let, him, go, sulla, attempted, to, open, negotiations, with, norbanus, who, was, at, capua, but, norbanus, refused, to, treat, and, withdrew, to, praeneste, as, sulla, advanced, while, sulla, was, moving, in, the, south, scipio, fought, pompey, in, picenum, but, was, defeated, when, his, troops, again, deserted, for, 82, bc, the, consular, elections, returned, gnaeus, papirius, carbo, in, his, third, consulship, with, the, younger, gaius, marius, the, son, of, the, seven, time, consul, who, was, then, twenty, six, the, remainder, of, 83, bc, was, dedicated, to, recruiting, for, the, next, year, s, campaign, amid, poor, weather, quintus, sertorius, had, raised, a, considerable, force, in, etruria, but, was, alienated, from, the, consuls, by, the, election, of, gaius, marius, son, rather, than, himself, and, so, left, to, his, praetorian, province, of, hispania, citerior, sulla, repudiated, recognition, of, any, treaties, with, the, samnites, whom, he, did, not, consider, to, be, roman, citizens, due, to, his, rejection, of, marius, and, cinna, s, deal, in, 87, bc, fighting, in, 82, bc, began, with, reverses, for, sulla, s, opponents, their, governors, in, africa, and, sardinia, were, deposed, when, the, campaign, in, italy, started, two, theatres, emerged, with, sulla, facing, the, younger, marius, in, the, south, and, metellus, pius, facing, carbo, in, the, north, marius, buttressed, by, samnite, support, fought, a, long, and, hard, battle, with, sulla, at, sacriportus, that, resulted, in, defeat, when, five, of, his, cohorts, defected, after, the, battle, marius, withdrew, to, praeneste, and, was, there, besieged, after, the, younger, marius, defeat, sulla, had, the, samnite, war, captives, massacred, which, triggered, an, uprising, in, his, rear, he, left, one, of, his, allies, quintus, lucretius, afella, to, maintain, the, siege, at, praeneste, and, moved, for, rome, at, the, same, time, the, younger, marius, sent, word, to, assemble, the, senate, and, purge, it, of, suspected, sullan, sympathisers, the, urban, praetor, lucius, junius, brutus, damasippus, then, had, four, prominent, men, killed, at, the, ensuing, meeting, the, purge, did, little, to, strengthen, resolve, and, when, sulla, arrived, at, rome, the, city, opened, its, gates, and, his, opponents, fled, sulla, had, his, enemies, declared, hostes, probably, from, outside, the, pomerium, and, after, assembling, an, assembly, where, he, apologised, for, the, war, left, to, fight, carbo, in, etruria, carbo, who, had, suffered, defeats, by, metellus, pius, and, pompey, attempted, to, redeploy, so, to, relieve, his, co, consul, marius, at, praeneste, skilfully, withdrawing, to, clusium, he, delegated, to, norbanus, command, of, troops, to, hold, metellus, pius, there, sulla, attacked, him, in, an, indecisive, battle, pompey, ambushed, eight, legions, sent, to, relieve, praeneste, but, an, uprising, from, the, samnites, and, the, lucanians, forced, sulla, to, deploy, south, as, they, moved, also, to, relieve, praeneste, or, join, with, carbo, in, the, north, sulla, s, specific, movements, are, very, vaguely, described, in, appian, but, he, was, successful, in, preventing, the, italians, from, relieving, praeneste, or, joining, with, carbo, in, the, north, at, the, same, time, norbanus, was, defeated, and, fled, for, rhodes, where, he, eventually, committed, suicide, after, another, attempt, to, relieve, praeneste, failed, carbo, lost, his, nerve, and, attempted, to, retreat, to, africa, his, lieutenants, attempted, again, to, relieve, praeneste, but, after, another, failure, marched, on, rome, to, force, sulla, from, his, well, defended, positions, sulla, hurried, in, full, force, towards, rome, and, there, fought, the, battle, of, the, colline, gate, on, the, afternoon, of, 1, november, 82, bc, sulla, was, defeated, and, forced, to, flee, into, his, camp, but, his, lieutenant, crassus, on, the, right, wing, was, victorious, sulla, s, wing, fled, to, the, gates, of, rome, but, were, met, with, a, closed, gate, forcing, them, to, stand, and, fight, eventually, winning, in, the, night, with, crassus, pursuing, the, enemy, as, far, into, the, countryside, and, victory, at, the, colline, gate, sulla, s, forces, had, won, the, samnite, and, anti, sullan, commanders, were, then, hunted, down, as, for, all, intents, and, purposes, the, civil, war, in, italy, was, over, after, the, battle, at, the, colline, gate, sulla, summoned, the, senate, to, the, temple, of, bellona, on, the, campus, martius, there, while, giving, a, speech, he, had, three, or, four, thousand, samnite, prisoners, butchered, to, the, shock, of, the, attending, senators, sulla, marched, to, praeneste, and, forced, its, siege, to, a, close, with, the, younger, marius, dead, from, suicide, before, its, surrender, sulla, had, his, stepdaughter, aemilia, daughter, of, princeps, senatus, marcus, aemilius, scaurus, married, to, pompey, although, she, shortly, died, in, childbirth, pompey, was, then, dispatched, to, recover, sicily, with, the, capture, and, execution, of, carbo, who, had, fled, sicily, for, egypt, both, consuls, for, 82, bc, were, now, dead, in, total, control, of, the, city, and, its, affairs, sulla, instituted, a, proscription, a, program, of, executing, and, confiscating, the, property, of, those, whom, he, perceived, as, enemies, of, the, state, plutarch, states, in, his, life, of, sulla, that, sulla, now, began, to, make, blood, flow, and, he, filled, the, city, with, deaths, without, number, or, limit, further, alleging, that, many, of, the, murdered, victims, had, nothing, to, do, with, sulla, though, sulla, killed, them, to, please, his, adherents, sulla, immediately, proscribed, 80, persons, without, communicating, with, any, magistrate, as, this, caused, a, general, murmur, he, let, one, day, pass, and, then, proscribed, 220, more, and, again, on, the, third, day, as, many, in, an, harangue, to, the, people, he, said, with, reference, to, these, measures, that, he, had, proscribed, all, he, could, think, of, and, as, to, those, who, now, escaped, his, memory, he, would, proscribe, them, at, some, future, time, the, proscriptions, are, widely, perceived, as, a, response, to, similar, killings, that, marius, and, cinna, had, implemented, while, they, controlled, the, republic, during, sulla, s, absence, proscribing, or, outlawing, every, one, of, those, whom, he, perceived, to, have, acted, against, the, best, interests, of, the, republic, while, he, was, in, the, east, sulla, ordered, some, 1, 500, nobles, i, e, senators, and, equites, executed, although, as, many, as, 9, 000, people, were, estimated, to, have, been, killed, the, purge, went, on, for, several, months, helping, or, sheltering, a, proscribed, person, was, punishable, by, death, while, killing, a, proscribed, person, was, rewarded, with, two, talents, family, members, of, the, proscribed, were, not, excluded, from, punishment, and, slaves, were, not, excluded, from, rewards, as, a, result, husbands, were, butchered, in, the, arms, of, their, wives, sons, in, the, arms, of, their, mothers, the, majority, of, the, proscribed, had, not, been, enemies, of, sulla, but, instead, were, killed, for, their, property, which, was, confiscated, and, auctioned, off, the, proceeds, from, auctioned, property, more, than, made, up, for, the, cost, of, rewarding, those, who, killed, the, proscribed, filling, the, treasury, possibly, to, protect, himself, from, future, political, retribution, sulla, had, the, sons, and, grandsons, of, the, proscribed, banned, from, running, for, political, office, a, restriction, not, removed, for, over, 30, years, the, teenaged, gaius, julius, caesar, as, cinna, s, son, in, law, became, one, of, sulla, s, targets, and, fled, the, city, he, was, saved, through, the, efforts, of, his, relatives, many, of, whom, were, sulla, s, supporters, sulla, later, noted, in, his, memoirs, that, he, regretted, sparing, the, boy, s, life, in, light, of, the, grown, man, s, notorious, ambition, historian, suetonius, records, that, when, agreeing, to, spare, caesar, sulla, warned, those, who, were, pleading, his, case, that, he, would, become, a, danger, to, them, in, the, future, saying, in, this, caesar, there, are, many, mariuses, at, the, end, of, 82, bc, or, the, beginning, of, 81, bc, the, senate, appointed, sulla, dictator, legibus, faciendis, et, reipublicae, constituendae, causa, dictator, for, the, making, of, laws, and, for, the, settling, of, the, constitution, the, assembly, of, the, people, subsequently, ratified, the, decision, with, no, limit, set, on, his, time, in, office, sulla, had, total, control, of, the, city, and, republic, of, rome, except, for, hispania, which, the, prominent, marian, general, quintus, sertorius, had, established, as, an, independent, state, this, unusual, appointment, used, hitherto, only, in, times, of, extreme, danger, to, the, city, such, as, during, the, second, punic, war, and, then, only, for, 6, month, periods, represented, an, exception, to, rome, s, policy, of, not, giving, total, power, to, an, individual, sulla, can, be, seen, as, setting, the, precedent, for, julius, caesar, s, dictatorship, and, for, the, eventual, end, of, the, republic, under, augustus, sulla, sought, to, strengthen, the, senatorial, aristocracy, s, position, in, the, state, sulla, retained, his, earlier, reforms, which, required, senatorial, approval, before, any, bill, could, be, submitted, to, the, plebeian, council, the, principal, popular, assembly, and, which, had, also, restored, the, older, more, aristocratic, servian, organization, to, the, centuriate, assembly, assembly, of, soldiers, sulla, himself, a, patrician, thus, ineligible, for, election, to, plebeian, tribunate, thoroughly, disliked, the, office, as, sulla, viewed, the, office, the, tribunate, was, especially, dangerous, and, his, intention, was, to, not, only, deprive, the, tribunate, of, power, but, also, of, prestige, sulla, himself, had, been, officially, deprived, of, his, eastern, command, through, the, underhanded, activities, of, a, tribune, over, the, previous, 300, years, the, tribunes, had, directly, challenged, the, patrician, class, and, attempted, to, deprive, it, of, power, in, favor, of, the, plebeian, class, through, sulla, s, reforms, to, the, plebeian, council, tribunes, lost, the, power, to, initiate, legislation, sulla, then, prohibited, ex, tribunes, from, ever, holding, any, other, office, so, ambitious, individuals, would, no, longer, seek, election, to, the, tribunate, since, such, an, election, would, end, their, political, career, finally, sulla, revoked, the, power, of, the, tribunes, to, veto, acts, of, the, senate, although, he, left, intact, the, tribunes, power, to, protect, individual, roman, citizens, sulla, then, increased, the, number, of, magistrates, elected, in, any, given, year, and, required, that, all, newly, elected, quaestores, gain, automatic, membership, in, the, senate, these, two, reforms, were, enacted, primarily, to, allow, sulla, to, increase, the, size, of, the, senate, from, 300, to, 600, senators, this, also, removed, the, need, for, the, censor, to, draw, up, a, list, of, senators, since, more, than, enough, former, magistrates, were, always, available, to, fill, the, senate, to, further, solidify, the, prestige, and, authority, of, the, senate, sulla, transferred, the, control, of, the, courts, from, the, equites, who, had, held, control, since, the, gracchan, reforms, to, the, senators, this, along, with, the, increase, in, the, number, of, courts, further, added, to, the, power, that, was, already, held, by, the, senators, sulla, also, codified, and, thus, established, definitively, the, cursus, honorum, which, required, an, individual, to, reach, a, certain, age, and, level, of, experience, before, running, for, office, sulla, wanted, to, reduce, the, risk, that, a, general, might, attempt, to, seize, power, as, he, had, done, to, this, end, he, reaffirmed, the, requirement, that, an, individual, must, wait, for, ten, years, before, being, re, elected, to, an, office, sulla, then, established, a, system, where, all, consuls, and, praetors, served, in, rome, during, their, year, in, office, and, then, commanded, a, provincial, army, as, a, governor, for, the, year, after, they, left, office, finally, in, a, demonstration, of, his, absolute, power, sulla, expanded, the, pomerium, the, sacred, boundary, of, rome, unchanged, since, the, time, of, the, kings, sulla, s, reforms, both, looked, to, the, past, often, repassing, former, laws, and, regulated, for, the, future, particularly, in, his, redefinition, of, maiestas, treason, laws, and, in, his, reform, of, the, senate, at, the, start, of, his, second, consulship, in, 80, bc, with, metellus, pius, sulla, resigned, his, dictatorship, he, also, disbanded, his, legions, and, through, these, gestures, attempted, to, show, the, re, establishment, of, normal, consular, government, he, dismissed, his, lictores, and, walked, unguarded, in, the, forum, offering, to, give, account, of, his, actions, to, any, citizen, in, a, manner, that, the, historian, suetonius, thought, arrogant, julius, caesar, later, mocked, sulla, for, resigning, the, dictatorship, as, promised, when, his, tasks, were, complete, sulla, returned, his, powers, and, withdrew, to, his, country, villa, near, puteoli, to, be, with, his, family, plutarch, states, in, his, life, of, sulla, that, he, retired, to, a, life, spent, in, dissolute, luxuries, and, he, consorted, with, actresses, harpists, and, theatrical, people, drinking, with, them, on, couches, all, day, long, from, this, distance, sulla, remained, out, of, the, day, to, day, political, activities, in, rome, intervening, only, a, few, times, when, his, policies, were, involved, e, g, the, execution, of, granius, shortly, before, his, own, death, sulla, s, goal, now, was, to, write, his, memoirs, which, he, finished, in, 78, bc, just, before, his, death, they, are, now, largely, lost, although, fragments, from, them, exist, as, quotations, in, later, writers, ancient, accounts, of, sulla, s, death, indicate, that, he, died, from, liver, failure, or, a, ruptured, gastric, ulcer, symptomized, by, a, sudden, hemorrhage, from, his, mouth, followed, by, a, fever, from, which, he, never, recovered, possibly, caused, by, chronic, alcohol, abuse, accounts, were, also, written, that, he, had, an, infestation, of, worms, caused, by, the, ulcers, which, led, to, his, death, his, public, funeral, in, rome, in, the, forum, in, the, presence, of, the, whole, city, was, on, a, scale, unmatched, until, that, of, augustus, in, ad, 14, sulla, s, body, was, brought, into, the, city, on, a, golden, bier, escorted, by, his, veteran, soldiers, and, funeral, orations, were, delivered, by, several, eminent, senators, with, the, main, oration, possibly, delivered, by, lucius, marcius, philippus, or, hortensius, sulla, s, body, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, placed, in, his, tomb, in, the, campus, martius, an, epitaph, which, sulla, composed, himself, was, inscribed, onto, the, tomb, reading, no, friend, ever, served, me, and, no, enemy, ever, wronged, me, whom, i, have, not, repaid, in, full, plutarch, claims, he, had, seen, sulla, s, personal, motto, carved, on, his, tomb, on, the, campus, martius, the, personal, motto, was, no, better, friend, no, worse, enemy, sulla, is, generally, seen, as, having, set, the, precedent, for, caesar, s, march, on, rome, and, dictatorship, cicero, comments, that, pompey, once, said, if, sulla, could, why, can, t, i, sulla, s, example, proved, that, it, could, be, done, therefore, inspiring, others, to, attempt, it, in, this, respect, he, has, been, seen, as, another, step, in, the, republic, s, fall, sulla, attempted, to, mitigate, this, by, passing, laws, to, limit, the, actions, of, generals, in, their, provinces, and, although, these, laws, remained, in, effect, well, into, the, imperial, period, they, did, not, prevent, determined, generals, such, as, pompey, and, julius, caesar, from, using, their, armies, for, personal, ambition, against, the, senate, a, danger, of, which, sulla, was, intimately, aware, while, sulla, s, laws, such, as, those, concerning, qualification, for, admittance, to, the, senate, reform, of, the, legal, system, and, regulations, of, governorships, remained, on, rome, s, statutes, long, into, the, principate, much, of, his, legislation, was, repealed, less, than, a, decade, after, his, death, the, veto, power, of, the, tribunes, and, their, legislating, authority, were, soon, reinstated, ironically, during, the, consulships, of, pompey, and, crassus, sulla, s, descendants, continued, to, be, prominent, in, roman, politics, into, the, imperial, period, his, son, faustus, cornelius, sulla, issued, denarii, bearing, the, name, of, the, dictator, as, did, a, grandson, quintus, pompeius, rufus, his, descendants, among, the, cornelii, sullae, would, hold, four, consulships, during, the, imperial, period, lucius, cornelius, sulla, in, 5, bc, faustus, cornelius, sulla, in, ad, 31, lucius, cornelius, sulla, felix, in, ad, 33, and, faustus, cornelius, sulla, felix, in, 52, ad, he, was, the, son, of, the, consul, of, 31, and, the, husband, of, claudia, antonia, daughter, of, the, emperor, claudius, his, execution, in, ad, 62, on, the, orders, of, emperor, nero, made, him, the, last, of, the, cornelii, sullae, it, is, recorded, that, emperor, caracalla, visited, and, renovated, sulla, s, tomb, and, commissioned, a, statue, of, sulla, to, be, erected, alongside, one, of, hannibal, in, troy, his, rival, gnaeus, papirius, carbo, described, sulla, as, having, the, cunning, of, a, fox, and, the, courage, of, a, lion, but, that, it, was, his, cunning, that, was, by, far, the, most, dangerous, this, mixture, was, later, referred, to, by, machiavelli, in, his, description, of, the, ideal, characteristics, of, a, ruler, sulla, was, red, blond, and, blue, eyed, and, had, a, dead, white, face, covered, with, red, marks, plutarch, notes, that, sulla, considered, that, his, golden, head, of, hair, gave, him, a, singular, appearance, he, was, said, to, have, a, duality, between, being, charming, easily, approachable, and, able, to, joke, and, cavort, with, the, most, simple, of, people, while, also, assuming, a, stern, demeanor, when, he, was, leading, armies, and, as, dictator, an, example, of, the, extent, of, his, charming, side, was, that, his, soldiers, would, sing, a, ditty, about, sulla, s, one, testicle, although, without, truth, which, he, allowed, as, being, fond, of, a, jest, this, duality, or, inconsistency, made, him, very, unpredictable, and, at, the, slightest, pretext, he, might, have, a, man, crucified, but, on, another, occasion, would, make, light, of, the, most, appalling, crimes, or, he, might, happily, forgive, the, most, unpardonable, offenses, and, then, punish, trivial, insignificant, misdemeanors, with, death, and, confiscation, of, property, his, excesses, and, penchant, for, debauchery, could, be, attributed, to, the, difficult, circumstances, of, his, youth, such, as, losing, his, father, while, he, was, still, in, his, teens, and, retaining, a, doting, stepmother, necessitating, an, independent, streak, from, an, early, age, the, circumstances, of, his, relative, poverty, as, a, young, man, left, him, removed, from, his, patrician, brethren, enabling, him, to, consort, with, revelers, and, experience, the, baser, side, of, human, nature, this, firsthand, understanding, of, human, motivations, and, the, ordinary, roman, citizen, may, explain, why, he, was, able, to, succeed, as, a, general, despite, lacking, any, significant, military, experience, before, his, 30s, the, historian, sallust, fleshes, out, this, character, sketch, of, sulla, he, was, well, versed, both, in, greek, and, roman, literature, and, had, a, truly, remarkable, mind, he, was, devoted, to, pleasure, but, more, devoted, to, glory, he, never, allowed, his, debaucheries, to, interfere, with, his, duties, but, he, devoted, all, his, leisure, time, to, them, he, was, both, eloquent, and, clever, and, he, made, friends, easily, when, it, came, to, hiding, his, intentions, his, mind, was, incredibly, unfathomable, yet, with, all, else, he, was, extremely, generous, especially, with, money
