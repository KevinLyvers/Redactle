from, leading, the, case, for, sir, pherozeshah, himself, a, noted, barrister, it, was, after, his, case, that, jinnah, posted, a, successful, record, becoming, well, known, for, his, advocacy, and, legal, logic, in, 1908, his, factional, foe, in, the, indian, national, congress, bal, gangadhar, tilak, was, arrested, for, sedition, before, tilak, unsuccessfully, represented, himself, at, trial,

one, of, jinnah, s, fellow, barristers, from, the, bombay, high, court, remembered, that, jinnah, s, faith, in, himself, was, incredible, he, recalled, that, on, being, admonished, by, a, judge, with, mr, jinnah, remember, that, you, are, not, addressing, a, third, class, magistrate, jinnah, shot, back, my, lord, allow, me, to, warn, you, that, you, are, not, addressing, a, third, class, pleader, another, of, his, fellow, barristers, described, him, saying, he, was, what, god, made, him, a, great, pleader, he, had, a, sixth, sense, he, could, see, around, corners, that, is, where, his, talents, lay, he, was, a, very, clear, thinker, but, he, drove, his, points, home, points, chosen, with, exquisite, selection, slow, delivery, word, by, word, jinnah, was, also, a, supporter, of, working, class, causes, and, an, active, trade, unionist, he, was, elected, president, of, all, india, postal, staff, union, in, 1925, whose, membership, was, 70, 000, according, to, all, pakistan,

and, struggled, for, getting, a, living, wage, and, fair, conditions, for, them, he, also, played, an, important, role, in, enactment, of, trade, union, act, of, 1926, which, gave, trade, union, movement, legal, cover, to, organise, themselves, in, 1857, many, indians, had, risen, in, revolt, against, british, rule, in, the, aftermath, of, the, conflict, some, anglo, indians, as, well, as, indians, in, britain, called, for, greater, self, government, for, the, subcontinent, resulting, in, the, founding, of, the, indian, national, congress, in, 1885, most, founding, members, had, been, educated, in, britain, and, were, content, with, the, minimal, reform, efforts, being, made, by, the, government, muslims, were, not, enthusiastic, about, calls, for, democratic, institutions, in, british, india, as, they, constituted, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, the, population, outnumbered, by, the, hindus, early, meetings, of, the, congress, contained, a, minority, of, muslims, mostly, from, the, elite, jinnah, devoted, much, of, his, time, to, his, law, practice, in, the, early, 1900s, but, remained, politically, involved, jinnah, began, political, life, by, attending, the, congress, s, twentieth, annual, meeting, in, bombay, in, december, 1904, he, was, a, member, of, the, moderate, group, in, the, congress, favouring, hindu, muslim, unity, in, achieving, self, government, and, following, such, leaders, as, mehta, naoroji, and, gopal, krishna, gokhale, they, were, opposed, by, leaders, such, as, tilak, and, lala, lajpat, rai, who, sought, quick, action, towards, independence, in, 1906, a, delegation, of, muslim, leaders, known, as, the, simla, delegation, headed, by, the, aga, khan, called, on, the, new, viceroy, of, india, lord, minto, to, assure, him, of, their, loyalty, and, to, ask, for, assurances, that, in, any, political, reforms, they, would, be, protected, from, the, unsympathetic, majority, dissatisfied, with, this, jinnah, wrote, a, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, newspaper, gujarati, asking, what, right, the, members, of, the, delegation, had, to, speak, for, indian, muslims, as, they, were, unelected, and, self, appointed, when, many, of, the, same, leaders, met, in, dacca, in, december, of, that, year, to, form, the, all, india, muslim, league, to, advocate, for, their, community, s, interests, jinnah, was, again, opposed, the, aga, khan, later, wrote, that, it, was, freakishly, ironic, that, jinnah, who, would, lead, the, league, to, independence, came, out, in, bitter, hostility, toward, all, that, i, and, my, friends, had, done, he, said, that, our, principle, of, separate, electorates, was, dividing, the, nation, against, itself, in, its, earliest, years, however, the, league, was, not, influential, minto, refused, to, consider, it, as, the, muslim, community, s, representative, and, it, was, ineffective, in, preventing, the, 1911, repeal, of, the, partition, of, bengal, an, action, seen, as, a, blow, to, muslim, interests, although, jinnah, initially, opposed, separate, electorates, for, muslims, he, used, this, means, to, gain, his, first, elective, office, in, 1909, as, bombay, s, muslim, representative, on, the, imperial, legislative, council, he, was, a, compromise, candidate, when, two, older, better, known, muslims, who, were, seeking, the, post, deadlocked, the, council, which, had, been, expanded, to, 60, members, as, part, of, reforms, enacted, by, minto, recommended, legislation, to, the, viceroy, only, officials, could, vote, in, the, council, non, official, members, such, as, jinnah, had, no, vote, throughout, his, legal, career, jinnah, practised, probate, law, with, many, clients, from, india, s, nobility, and, in, 1911, introduced, the, wakf, validation, act, to, place, muslim, religious, trusts, on, a, sound, legal, footing, under, british, indian, law, two, years, later, the, measure, passed, the, first, act, sponsored, by, non, officials, to, pass, the, council, and, be, enacted, by, the, viceroy, jinnah, was, also, appointed, to, a, committee, which, helped, to, establish, the, indian, military, academy, in, dehra, dun, in, december, 1912, jinnah, addressed, the, annual, meeting, of, the, muslim, league, although, he, was, not, yet, a, member, he, joined, the, following, year, although, he, remained, a, member, of, the, congress, as, well, and, stressed, that, league, membership, took, second, priority, to, the, greater, national, cause, of, an, independent, india, in, april, 1913, he, again, went, to, britain, with, gokhale, to, meet, with, officials, on, behalf, of, the, congress, gokhale, a, hindu, later, stated, that, jinnah, has, true, stuff, in, him, and, that, freedom, from, all, sectarian, prejudice, which, will, make, him, the, best, ambassador, of, hindu, muslim, unity, jinnah, led, another, delegation, of, the, congress, to, london, in, 1914, but, due, to, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, in, august, 1914, found, officials, little, interested, in, indian, reforms, by, coincidence, he, was, in, britain, at, the, same, time, as, a, man, who, would, become, his, great, political, rival, mohandas, gandhi, a, hindu, lawyer, who, had, become, well, known, for, advocating, satyagraha, non, violent, non, co, operation, while, in, south, africa, jinnah, attended, a, reception, for, gandhi, where, the, two, men, met, and, talked, with, each, other, for, the, first, time, shortly, afterwards, jinnah, returned, home, to, india, in, january, 1915, jinnah, s, moderate, faction, in, the, congress, was, undermined, by, the, deaths, of, mehta, and, gokhale, in, 1915, he, was, further, isolated, by, the, fact, that, naoroji, was, in, london, where, he, remained, until, his, death, in, 1917, nevertheless, jinnah, worked, to, bring, the, congress, and, league, together, in, 1916, with, jinnah, now, president, of, the, muslim, league, the, two, organisations, signed, the, lucknow, pact, setting, quotas, for, muslim, and, hindu, representation, in, the, various, provinces, although, the, pact, was, never, fully, implemented, its, signing, ushered, in, a, period, of, co, operation, between, the, congress, and, the, league, during, the, war, jinnah, joined, other, indian, moderates, in, supporting, the, british, war, effort, hoping, that, indians, would, be, rewarded, with, political, freedoms, jinnah, played, an, important, role, in, the, founding, of, the, all, india, home, rule, league, in, 1916, along, with, political, leaders, annie, besant, and, tilak, jinnah, demanded, home, rule, for, india, the, status, of, a, self, governing, dominion, in, the, empire, similar, to, canada, new, zealand, and, australia, although, with, the, war, britain, s, politicians, were, not, interested, in, considering, indian, constitutional, reform, british, cabinet, minister, edwin, montagu, recalled, jinnah, in, his, memoirs, young, perfectly, mannered, impressive, looking, armed, to, the, teeth, with, dialectics, and, insistent, on, the, whole, of, his, scheme, in, 1918, jinnah, married, his, second, wife, rattanbai, petit, ruttie, 24, years, his, junior, she, was, the, fashionable, young, daughter, of, his, friend, sir, dinshaw, petit, and, was, part, of, an, elite, parsi, family, of, bombay, there, was, great, opposition, to, the, marriage, from, rattanbai, s, family, and, the, parsi, community, as, well, as, from, some, muslim, religious, leaders, rattanbai, defied, her, family, and, nominally, converted, to, islam, adopting, though, never, using, the, name, maryam, jinnah, resulting, in, a, permanent, estrangement, from, her, family, and, parsi, society, the, couple, resided, at, south, court, mansion, in, bombay, and, frequently, travelled, across, india, and, europe, the, couple, s, only, child, daughter, dina, was, born, on, 15, august, 1919, the, couple, separated, prior, to, ruttie, s, death, in, 1929, and, subsequently, jinnah, s, sister, fatima, looked, after, him, and, his, child, relations, between, indians, and, british, were, strained, in, 1919, when, the, imperial, legislative, council, extended, emergency, wartime, restrictions, on, civil, liberties, jinnah, resigned, from, it, when, it, did, there, was, unrest, across, india, which, worsened, after, the, jallianwala, bagh, massacre, in, amritsar, in, which, british, indian, army, troops, fired, upon, a, protest, meeting, killing, hundreds, in, the, wake, of, amritsar, gandhi, who, had, returned, to, india, and, become, a, widely, respected, leader, and, highly, influential, in, the, congress, called, for, satyagraha, against, the, british, gandhi, s, proposal, gained, broad, hindu, support, and, was, also, attractive, to, many, muslims, of, the, khilafat, faction, these, muslims, supported, by, gandhi, sought, retention, of, the, ottoman, caliphate, which, supplied, spiritual, leadership, to, many, muslims, the, caliph, was, the, ottoman, emperor, who, would, be, deprived, of, both, offices, following, his, nation, s, defeat, in, the, first, world, war, gandhi, had, achieved, considerable, popularity, among, muslims, because, of, his, work, during, the, war, on, behalf, of, killed, or, imprisoned, muslims, unlike, jinnah, and, other, leaders, of, the, congress, gandhi, did, not, wear, western, style, clothing, did, his, best, to, use, an, indian, language, instead, of, english, and, was, deeply, rooted, in, indian, culture, gandhi, s, local, style, of, leadership, gained, great, popularity, with, the, indian, people, jinnah, criticised, gandhi, s, khilafat, advocacy, which, he, saw, as, an, endorsement, of, religious, zealotry, jinnah, regarded, gandhi, s, proposed, satyagraha, campaign, as, political, anarchy, and, believed, that, self, government, should, be, secured, through, constitutional, means, he, opposed, gandhi, but, the, tide, of, indian, opinion, was, against, him, at, the, 1920, session, of, the, congress, in, nagpur, jinnah, was, shouted, down, by, the, delegates, who, passed, gandhi, s, proposal, pledging, satyagraha, until, india, was, independent, jinnah, did, not, attend, the, subsequent, league, meeting, held, in, the, same, city, which, passed, a, similar, resolution, because, of, the, action, of, the, congress, in, endorsing, gandhi, s, campaign, jinnah, resigned, from, it, leaving, all, positions, except, in, the, muslim, league, the, alliance, between, gandhi, and, the, khilafat, faction, did, not, last, long, and, the, campaign, of, resistance, proved, less, effective, than, hoped, as, india, s, institutions, continued, to, function, jinnah, sought, alternative, political, ideas, and, contemplated, organising, a, new, political, party, as, a, rival, to, the, congress, in, september, 1923, jinnah, was, elected, as, muslim, member, for, bombay, in, the, new, central, legislative, assembly, he, showed, much, skill, as, a, parliamentarian, organising, many, indian, members, to, work, with, the, swaraj, party, and, continued, to, press, demands, for, full, responsible, government, in, 1925, as, recognition, for, his, legislative, activities, he, was, offered, a, knighthood, by, lord, reading, who, was, retiring, from, the, viceroyalty, he, replied, i, prefer, to, be, plain, mr, jinnah, in, 1927, the, british, government, under, conservative, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, undertook, a, decennial, review, of, indian, policy, mandated, by, the, government, of, india, act, 1919, the, review, began, two, years, early, as, baldwin, feared, he, would, lose, the, next, election, which, he, did, in, 1929, the, cabinet, was, influenced, by, minister, winston, churchill, who, strongly, opposed, self, government, for, india, and, members, hoped, that, by, having, the, commission, appointed, early, the, policies, for, india, which, they, favoured, would, survive, their, government, the, resulting, commission, led, by, liberal, mp, john, simon, though, with, a, majority, of, conservatives, arrived, in, india, in, march, 1928, they, were, met, with, a, boycott, by, india, s, leaders, muslim, and, hindu, alike, angered, at, the, british, refusal, to, include, their, representatives, on, the, commission, a, minority, of, muslims, though, withdrew, from, the, league, choosing, to, welcome, the, simon, commission, and, repudiating, jinnah, most, members, of, the, league, s, executive, council, remained, loyal, to, jinnah, attending, the, league, meeting, in, december, 1927, and, january, 1928, which, confirmed, him, as, the, league, s, permanent, president, at, that, session, jinnah, told, the, delegates, that, a, constitutional, war, has, been, declared, on, great, britain, negotiations, for, a, settlement, are, not, to, come, from, our, side, by, appointing, an, exclusively, white, commission, lord, birkenhead, has, declared, our, unfitness, for, self, government, birkenhead, in, 1928, challenged, indians, to, come, up, with, their, own, proposal, for, constitutional, change, for, india, in, response, the, congress, convened, a, committee, under, the, leadership, of, motilal, nehru, the, nehru, report, favoured, constituencies, based, on, geography, on, the, ground, that, being, dependent, on, each, other, for, election, would, bind, the, communities, closer, together, jinnah, though, he, believed, separate, electorates, based, on, religion, necessary, to, ensure, muslims, had, a, voice, in, the, government, was, willing, to, compromise, on, this, point, but, talks, between, the, two, parties, failed, he, put, forth, proposals, that, he, hoped, might, satisfy, a, broad, range, of, muslims, and, reunite, the, league, calling, for, mandatory, representation, for, muslims, in, legislatures, and, cabinets, these, became, known, as, his, fourteen, points, he, could, not, secure, adoption, of, the, fourteen, points, as, the, league, meeting, in, delhi, at, which, he, hoped, to, gain, a, vote, instead, dissolved, into, chaotic, argument, after, baldwin, was, defeated, at, the, 1929, british, parliamentary, election, ramsay, macdonald, of, the, labour, party, became, prime, minister, macdonald, desired, a, conference, of, indian, and, british, leaders, in, london, to, discuss, india, s, future, a, course, of, action, supported, by, jinnah, three, round, table, conferences, followed, over, as, many, years, none, of, which, resulted, in, a, settlement, jinnah, was, a, delegate, to, the, first, two, conferences, but, was, not, invited, to, the, last, he, remained, in, britain, for, most, of, the, period, 1930, through, 1934, practising, as, a, barrister, before, the, privy, council, where, he, dealt, with, a, number, of, india, related, cases, his, biographers, disagree, over, why, he, remained, so, long, in, britain, wolpert, asserts, that, had, jinnah, been, made, a, law, lord, he, would, have, stayed, for, life, and, that, jinnah, alternatively, sought, a, parliamentary, seat, early, biographer, hector, bolitho, denied, that, jinnah, sought, to, enter, the, british, parliament, while, jaswant, singh, deems, jinnah, s, time, in, britain, as, a, break, or, sabbatical,

in, 1931, fatima, jinnah, joined, her, brother, in, england, from, then, on, muhammad, ali, jinnah, would, receive, personal, care, and, support, from, her, as, he, aged, and, began, to, suffer, from, the, lung, ailments, which, would, eventually, kill, him, she, lived, and, travelled, with, him, and, became, a, close, advisor, muhammad, jinnah, s, daughter, dina, was, educated, in, england, and, india, jinnah, later, became, estranged, from, dina, after, she, decided, to, marry, a, parsi, neville, wadia, from, a, prominent, business, family, when, jinnah, urged, dina, to, marry, a, muslim, she, reminded, him, that, he, had, married, a, woman, not, raised, in, his, faith, jinnah, continued, to, correspond, cordially, with, his, daughter, but, their, personal, relationship, was, strained, and, she, did, not, come, to, pakistan, in, his, lifetime, but, only, for, his, funeral, the, early, 1930s, saw, a, resurgence, in, indian, muslim, nationalism, which, came, to, a, head, with, the, pakistan, declaration, in, 1933, indian, muslims, especially, from, the, united, provinces, began, to, urge, jinnah, to, return, and, take, up, again, his, leadership, of, the, muslim, league, an, organisation, which, had, fallen, into, inactivity, he, remained, titular, president, of, the, league, but, declined, to, travel, to, india, to, preside, over, its, 1933, session, in, april, writing, that, he, could, not, possibly, return, there, until, the, end, of, the, year, among, those, who, met, with, jinnah, to, seek, his, return, was, liaquat, ali, khan, who, would, be, a, major, political, associate, of, jinnah, in, the, years, to, come, and, the, first, prime, minister, of, pakistan, at, jinnah, s, request, liaquat, discussed, the, return, with, a, large, number, of, muslim, politicians, and, confirmed, his, recommendation, to, jinnah, in, early, 1934, jinnah, relocated, to, the, subcontinent, though, he, shuttled, between, london, and, india, on, business, for, the, next, few, years, selling, his, house, in, hampstead, and, closing, his, legal, practice, in, britain, muslims, of, bombay, elected, jinnah, though, then, absent, in, london, as, their, representative, to, the, central, legislative, assembly, in, october, 1934, the, british, parliament, s, government, of, india, act, 1935, gave, considerable, power, to, india, s, provinces, with, a, weak, central, parliament, in, new, delhi, which, had, no, authority, over, such, matters, as, foreign, policy, defence, and, much, of, the, budget, full, power, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, viceroy, however, who, could, dissolve, legislatures, and, rule, by, decree, the, league, reluctantly, accepted, the, scheme, though, expressing, reservations, about, the, weak, parliament, the, congress, was, much, better, prepared, for, the, provincial, elections, in, 1937, and, the, league, failed, to, win, a, majority, even, of, the, muslim, seats, in, any, of, the, provinces, where, members, of, that, faith, held, a, majority, it, did, win, a, majority, of, the, muslim, seats, in, delhi, but, could, not, form, a, government, anywhere, though, it, was, part, of, the, ruling, coalition, in, bengal, the, congress, and, its, allies, formed, the, government, even, in, the, north, west, frontier, province, n, w, f, p, where, the, league, won, no, seats, despite, the, fact, that, almost, all, residents, were, muslim, according, to, jaswant, singh, the, events, of, 1937, had, a, tremendous, almost, a, traumatic, effect, upon, jinnah, despite, his, beliefs, of, twenty, years, that, muslims, could, protect, their, rights, in, a, united, india, through, separate, electorates, provincial, boundaries, drawn, to, preserve, muslim, majorities, and, by, other, protections, of, minority, rights, muslim, voters, had, failed, to, unite, with, the, issues, jinnah, hoped, to, bring, forward, lost, amid, factional, fighting, singh, notes, the, effect, of, the, 1937, elections, on, muslim, political, opinion, when, the, congress, formed, a, government, with, almost, all, of, the, muslim, mlas, sitting, on, the, opposition, benches, non, congress, muslims, were, suddenly, faced, with, this, stark, reality, of, near, total, political, powerlessness, it, was, brought, home, to, them, like, a, bolt, of, lightning, that, even, if, the, congress, did, not, win, a, single, muslim, seat, as, long, as, it, won, an, absolute, majority, in, the, house, on, the, strength, of, the, general, seats, it, could, and, would, form, a, government, entirely, on, its, own, in, the, next, two, years, jinnah, worked, to, build, support, among, muslims, for, the, league, he, secured, the, right, to, speak, for, the, muslim, led, bengali, and, punjabi, provincial, governments, in, the, central, government, in, new, delhi, the, centre, he, worked, to, expand, the, league, reducing, the, cost, of, membership, to, two, annas, 1, 8, of, a, rupee, half, of, what, it, cost, to, join, the, congress, he, restructured, the, league, along, the, lines, of, the, congress, putting, most, power, in, a, working, committee, which, he, appointed, by, december, 1939, liaquat, estimated, that, the, league, had, three, million, two, anna, members, until, the, late, 1930s, most, muslims, of, the, british, raj, expected, upon, independence, to, be, part, of, a, unitary, state, encompassing, all, of, british, india, as, did, the, hindus, and, others, who, advocated, self, government, despite, this, other, nationalist, proposals, were, being, made, in, a, speech, given, at, allahabad, to, a, league, session, in, 1930, sir, muhammad, iqbal, called, for, a, state, for, muslims, in, british, india, choudhary, rahmat, ali, published, a, pamphlet, in, 1933, advocating, a, state, pakistan, in, the, indus, valley, with, other, names, given, to, muslim, majority, areas, elsewhere, in, india, jinnah, and, iqbal, corresponded, in, 1936, and, 1937, in, subsequent, years, jinnah, credited, iqbal, as, his, mentor, and, used, iqbal, s, imagery, and, rhetoric, in, his, speeches, although, many, leaders, of, the, congress, sought, a, strong, central, government, for, an, indian, state, some, muslim, politicians, including, jinnah, were, unwilling, to, accept, this, without, powerful, protections, for, their, community, other, muslims, supported, the, congress, which, officially, advocated, a, secular, state, upon, independence, though, the, traditionalist, wing, including, politicians, such, as, madan, mohan, malaviya, and, vallabhbhai, patel, believed, that, an, independent, india, should, enact, laws, such, as, banning, the, killing, of, cows, and, making, hindi, a, national, language, the, failure, of, the, congress, leadership, to, disavow, hindu, communalists, worried, congress, supporting, muslims, nevertheless, the, congress, enjoyed, considerable, muslim, support, up, to, about, 1937, events, which, separated, the, communities, included, the, failed, attempt, to, form, a, coalition, government, including, the, congress, and, the, league, in, the, united, provinces, following, the, 1937, election, according, to, historian, ian, talbot, the, provincial, congress, governments, made, no, effort, to, understand, and, respect, their, muslim, populations, cultural, and, religious, sensibilities, the, muslim, league, s, claims, that, it, alone, could, safeguard, muslim, interests, thus, received, a, major, boost, significantly, it, was, only, after, this, period, of, congress, rule, that, it, took, up, the, demand, for, a, pakistan, state, balraj, puri, in, his, journal, article, about, jinnah, suggests, that, the, muslim, league, president, after, the, 1937, vote, turned, to, the, idea, of, partition, in, sheer, desperation, historian, akbar, s, ahmed, suggests, that, jinnah, abandoned, hope, of, reconciliation, with, the, congress, as, he, rediscover, his, own, islamic, roots, his, own, sense, of, identity, of, culture, and, history, which, would, come, increasingly, to, the, fore, in, the, final, years, of, his, life, jinnah, also, increasingly, adopted, muslim, dress, in, the, late, 1930s, in, the, wake, of, the, 1937, balloting, jinnah, demanded, that, the, question, of, power, sharing, be, settled, on, an, all, india, basis, and, that, he, as, president, of, the, league, be, accepted, as, the, sole, spokesman, for, the, muslim, community, there, is, only, one, way, out, muslims, should, strengthen, jinnah, s, hands, they, should, join, the, muslim, league, indian, question, as, is, now, being, solved, can, be, countered, by, our, united, front, against, both, the, hindus, and, the, english, without, it, our, demands, are, not, going, to, be, accepted, people, say, our, demands, smack, of, communalism, this, is, sheer, propaganda, these, demands, relate, to, the, defence, of, our, national, existence, the, united, front, can, be, formed, under, the, leadership, of, the, muslim, league, and, the, muslim, league, can, succeed, only, on, account, of, jinnah, now, none, but, jinnah, is, capable, of, leading, the, muslims, muhammad, iqbal, 1938, the, well, documented, influence, of, iqbal, on, jinnah, with, regard, to, taking, the, lead, in, creating, pakistan, has, been, described, as, significant, powerful, and, even, unquestionable, by, scholars, iqbal, has, also, been, cited, as, an, influential, force, in, convincing, jinnah, to, end, his, self, imposed, exile, in, london, and, re, enter, the, politics, of, india, initially, however, iqbal, and, jinnah, were, opponents, as, iqbal, believed, jinnah, did, not, care, about, the, crises, confronting, the, muslim, community, during, the, british, raj, according, to, akbar, s, ahmed, this, began, to, change, during, iqbal, s, final, years, prior, to, his, death, in, 1938, iqbal, gradually, succeeded, in, converting, jinnah, over, to, his, view, who, eventually, accepted, iqbal, as, his, mentor, ahmed, comments, that, in, his, annotations, to, iqbal, s, letters, jinnah, expressed, solidarity, with, iqbal, s, view, that, indian, muslims, required, a, separate, homeland, iqbal, s, influence, also, gave, jinnah, a, deeper, appreciation, for, muslim, identity, the, evidence, of, this, influence, began, to, be, revealed, from, 1937, onwards, jinnah, not, only, began, to, echo, iqbal, in, his, speeches, he, started, using, islamic, symbolism, and, began, directing, his, addresses, to, the, underprivileged, ahmed, noted, a, change, in, jinnah, s, words, while, he, still, advocated, freedom, of, religion, and, protection, of, the, minorities, the, model, he, was, now, aspiring, to, was, that, of, the, prophet, muhammad, rather, than, that, of, a, secular, politician, ahmed, further, avers, that, those, scholars, who, have, painted, the, later, jinnah, as, secular, have, misread, his, speeches, which, he, argues, must, be, read, in, the, context, of, islamic, history, and, culture, accordingly, jinnah, s, imagery, of, the, pakistan, began, to, become, clear, that, it, was, to, have, an, islamic, nature, this, change, has, been, seen, to, last, for, the, rest, of, jinnah, s, life, he, continued, to, borrow, ideas, directly, from, iqbal, including, his, thoughts, on, muslim, unity, on, islamic, ideals, of, liberty, justice, and, equality, on, economics, and, even, on, practices, such, as, prayers, in, a, speech, in, 1940, two, years, after, the, death, of, iqbal, jinnah, expressed, his, preference, for, implementing, iqbal, s, vision, for, an, islamic, pakistan, even, if, it, meant, he, himself, would, never, lead, a, nation, jinnah, stated, if, i, live, to, see, the, ideal, of, a, muslim, state, being, achieved, in, india, and, i, was, then, offered, to, make, a, choice, between, the, works, of, iqbal, and, the, rulership, of, the, muslim, state, i, would, prefer, the, former, on, 3, september, 1939, british, prime, minister, neville, chamberlain, announced, the, commencement, of, war, with, nazi, germany, the, following, day, the, viceroy, lord, linlithgow, without, consulting, indian, political, leaders, announced, that, india, had, entered, the, war, along, with, britain, there, were, widespread, protests, in, india, after, meeting, with, jinnah, and, with, gandhi, linlithgow, announced, that, negotiations, on, self, government, were, suspended, for, the, duration, of, the, war, the, congress, on, 14, september, demanded, immediate, independence, with, a, constituent, assembly, to, decide, a, constitution, when, this, was, refused, its, eight, provincial, governments, resigned, on, 10, november, and, governors, in, those, provinces, thereafter, ruled, by, decree, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, jinnah, on, the, other, hand, was, more, willing, to, accommodate, the, british, and, they, in, turn, increasingly, recognised, him, and, the, league, as, the, representatives, of, india, s, muslims, jinnah, later, stated, after, the, war, began, i, was, treated, on, the, same, basis, as, mr, gandhi, i, was, wonderstruck, why, i, was, promoted, and, given, a, place, side, by, side, with, mr, gandhi, although, the, league, did, not, actively, support, the, british, war, effort, neither, did, they, try, to, obstruct, it, with, the, british, and, muslims, to, some, extent, co, operating, the, viceroy, asked, jinnah, for, an, expression, of, the, muslim, league, s, position, on, self, government, confident, that, it, would, differ, greatly, from, that, of, the, congress, to, come, up, with, such, a, position, the, league, s, working, committee, met, for, four, days, in, february, 1940, to, set, out, terms, of, reference, to, a, constitutional, sub, committee, the, working, committee, asked, that, the, sub, committee, return, with, a, proposal, that, would, result, in, independent, dominions, in, direct, relationship, with, great, britain, where, muslims, were, dominant, on, 6, february, jinnah, informed, the, viceroy, that, the, muslim, league, would, be, demanding, partition, instead, of, the, federation, contemplated, in, the, 1935, act, the, lahore, resolution, sometimes, called, the, pakistan, resolution, although, it, does, not, contain, that, name, based, on, the, sub, committee, s, work, embraced, the, two, nation, theory, and, called, for, a, union, of, the, muslim, majority, provinces, in, the, northwest, of, british, india, with, complete, autonomy, similar, rights, were, to, be, granted, to, the, muslim, majority, areas, in, the, east, and, unspecified, protections, given, to, muslim, minorities, in, other, provinces, the, resolution, was, passed, by, the, league, session, in, lahore, on, 23, march, 1940, gandhi, s, reaction, to, the, lahore, resolution, was, muted, he, called, it, baffling, but, told, his, disciples, that, muslims, in, common, with, other, people, of, india, had, the, right, to, self, determination, leaders, of, the, congress, were, more, vocal, jawaharlal, nehru, referred, to, lahore, as, jinnah, s, fantastic, proposals, while, chakravarti, rajagopalachari, deemed, jinnah, s, views, on, partition, a, sign, of, a, diseased, mentality, linlithgow, met, with, jinnah, in, june, 1940, soon, after, winston, churchill, became, the, british, prime, minister, and, in, august, offered, both, the, congress, and, the, league, a, deal, whereby, in, exchange, for, full, support, for, the, war, linlithgow, would, allow, indian, representation, on, his, major, war, councils, the, viceroy, promised, a, representative, body, after, the, war, to, determine, india, s, future, and, that, no, future, settlement, would, be, imposed, over, the, objections, of, a, large, part, of, the, population, this, was, satisfactory, to, neither, the, congress, nor, the, league, though, jinnah, was, pleased, that, the, british, had, moved, towards, recognising, jinnah, as, the, representative, of, the, muslim, community, s, interests, jinnah, was, reluctant, to, make, specific, proposals, as, to, the, boundaries, of, pakistan, or, its, relationships, with, britain, and, with, the, rest, of, the, subcontinent, fearing, that, any, precise, plan, would, divide, the, league, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, december, 1941, brought, the, united, states, into, the, war, in, the, following, months, the, japanese, advanced, in, southeast, asia, and, the, british, cabinet, sent, a, mission, led, by, sir, stafford, cripps, to, try, to, conciliate, the, indians, and, cause, them, to, fully, back, the, war, cripps, proposed, giving, some, provinces, what, was, dubbed, the, local, option, to, remain, outside, of, an, indian, central, government, either, for, a, period, of, time, or, permanently, to, become, dominions, on, their, own, or, be, part, of, another, confederation, the, muslim, league, was, far, from, certain, of, winning, the, legislative, votes, that, would, be, required, for, mixed, provinces, such, as, bengal, and, punjab, to, secede, and, jinnah, rejected, the, proposals, as, not, sufficiently, recognising, pakistan, s, right, to, exist, the, congress, also, rejected, the, cripps, plan, demanding, immediate, concessions, which, cripps, was, not, prepared, to, give, despite, the, rejection, jinnah, and, the, league, saw, the, cripps, proposal, as, recognising, pakistan, in, principle, the, congress, followed, the, failed, cripps, mission, by, demanding, in, august, 1942, that, the, british, immediately, quit, india, proclaiming, a, mass, campaign, of, satyagraha, until, they, did, the, british, promptly, arrested, most, major, leaders, of, the, congress, and, imprisoned, them, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, gandhi, however, was, placed, on, house, arrest, in, one, of, the, aga, khan, s, palaces, prior, to, his, release, for, health, reasons, in, 1944, with, the, congress, leaders, absent, from, the, political, scene, jinnah, warned, against, the, threat, of, hindu, domination, and, maintained, his, pakistan, demand, without, going, into, great, detail, about, what, that, would, entail, jinnah, also, worked, to, increase, the, league, s, political, control, at, the, provincial, level, he, helped, to, found, the, newspaper, dawn, in, the, early, 1940s, in, delhi, it, helped, to, spread, the, league, s, message, and, eventually, became, the, major, english, language, newspaper, of, pakistan, he, also, started, living, in, delhi, on, aurangzeb, road, now, dr, a, p, j, abdul, kalam, road, near, birla, house, where, mahatma, gandhi, stayed, and, jinnah, was, neighbours, with, the, wealthiest, man, in, delhi, at, the, time, sir, sobha, singh, his, house, is, now, the, embassy, of, netherlands, in, india, and, is, known, as, jinnah, house, by, most, in, september, 1944, jinnah, hosted, gandhi, recently, released, from, confinement, at, his, home, on, malabar, hill, in, bombay, two, weeks, of, talks, between, them, followed, which, resulted, in, no, agreement, jinnah, insisted, on, pakistan, being, conceded, prior, to, the, british, departure, and, to, come, into, being, immediately, while, gandhi, proposed, that, plebiscites, on, partition, occur, sometime, after, a, united, india, gained, its, independence, in, early, 1945, liaquat, and, the, congress, leader, bhulabhai, desai, met, with, jinnah, s, approval, and, agreed, that, after, the, war, the, congress, and, the, league, should, form, an, interim, government, with, the, members, of, the, executive, council, of, the, viceroy, to, be, nominated, by, the, congress, and, the, league, in, equal, numbers, when, the, congress, leadership, were, released, from, prison, in, june, 1945, they, repudiated, the, agreement, and, censured, desai, for, acting, without, proper, authority, field, marshal, viscount, wavell, succeeded, linlithgow, as, viceroy, in, 1943, in, june, 1945, following, the, release, of, the, congress, leaders, wavell, called, for, a, conference, and, invited, the, leading, figures, from, the, various, communities, to, meet, with, him, at, simla, he, proposed, a, temporary, government, along, the, lines, which, liaquat, and, desai, had, agreed, however, wavell, was, unwilling, to, guarantee, that, only, the, league, s, candidates, would, be, placed, in, the, seats, reserved, for, muslims, all, other, invited, groups, submitted, lists, of, candidates, to, the, viceroy, wavell, cut, the, conference, short, in, mid, july, without, further, seeking, an, agreement, with, a, british, general, election, imminent, churchill, s, government, did, not, feel, it, could, proceed, british, voters, returned, clement, attlee, and, his, labour, party, to, government, later, in, july, attlee, and, his, secretary, of, state, for, india, lord, frederick, pethick, lawrence, immediately, ordered, a, review, of, the, indian, situation, jinnah, had, no, comment, on, the, change, of, government, but, called, a, meeting, of, his, working, committee, and, issued, a, statement, calling, for, new, elections, in, india, the, league, held, influence, at, the, provincial, level, in, the, muslim, majority, states, mostly, by, alliance, and, jinnah, believed, that, given, the, opportunity, the, league, would, improve, its, electoral, standing, and, lend, added, support, to, his, claim, to, be, the, sole, spokesman, for, the, muslims, wavell, returned, to, india, in, september, after, consultation, with, his, new, masters, in, london, elections, both, for, the, centre, and, for, the, provinces, were, announced, soon, after, the,

bolitho, this, was, jinnah, s, glorious, hour, his, arduous, political, campaigns, his, robust, beliefs, and, claims, were, at, last, justified, wolpert, wrote, that, the, league, election, showing, appeared, to, prove, the, universal, appeal, of, pakistan, among, muslims, of, the, subcontinent, the, congress, dominated, the, central, assembly, nevertheless, though, it, lost, four, seats, from, its, previous, strength, in, february, 1946, the, british, cabinet, resolved, to, send, a, delegation, to, india, to, negotiate, with, leaders, there, this, cabinet, mission, included, cripps, and, pethick, lawrence, the, highest, level, delegation, to, try, to, break, the, deadlock, it, arrived, in, new, delhi, in, late, march, little, negotiation, had, been, done, since, the, previous, october, because, of, the, elections, in, india, the, british, in, may, released, a, plan, for, a, united, indian, state, comprising, substantially, autonomous, provinces, and, called, for, groups, of, provinces, formed, on, the, basis, of, religion, matters, such, as, defence, external, relations, and, communications, would, be, handled, by, a, central, authority, provinces, would, have, the, option, of, leaving, the, union, entirely, and, there, would, be, an, interim, government, with, representation, from, the, congress, and, the, league, jinnah, and, his, working, committee, accepted, this, plan, in, june, but, it, fell, apart, over, the, question, of, how, many, members, of, the, interim, government, the, congress, and, the, league, would, have, and, over, the, congress, s, desire, to, include, a, muslim, member, in, its, representation, before, leaving, india, the, british, ministers, stated, that, they, intended, to, inaugurate, an, interim, government, even, if, one, of, the, major, groups, was, unwilling, to, participate, the, congress, soon, joined, the, new, indian, ministry, the, league, was, slower, to, do, so, not, entering, until, october, 1946, in, agreeing, to, have, the, league, join, the, government, jinnah, abandoned, his, demands, for, parity, with, the, congress, and, a, veto, on, matters, concerning, muslims, the, new, ministry, met, amid, a, backdrop, of, rioting, especially, in, calcutta, the, congress, wanted, the, viceroy, to, immediately, summon, the, constituent, assembly, and, begin, the, work, of, writing, a, constitution, and, felt, that, the, league, ministers, should, either, join, in, the, request, or, resign, from, the, government, wavell, attempted, to, save, the, situation, by, flying, leaders, such, as, jinnah, liaquat, and, jawaharlal, nehru, to, london, in, december, 1946, at, the, end, of, the, talks, participants, issued, a, statement, that, the, constitution, would, not, be, forced, on, any, unwilling, parts, of, india, on, the, way, back, from, london, jinnah, and, liaquat, stopped, in, cairo, for, several, days, of, pan, islamic, meetings, the, congress, endorsed, the, joint, statement, from, the, london, conference, over, the, angry, dissent, from, some, elements, the, league, refused, to, do, so, and, took, no, part, in, the, constitutional, discussions, jinnah, had, been, willing, to, consider, some, continued, links, to, hindustan, as, the, hindu, majority, state, which, would, be, formed, on, partition, was, sometimes, referred, to, such, as, a, joint, military, or, communications, however, by, december, 1946, he, insisted, on, a, fully, sovereign, pakistan, with, dominion, status, following, the, failure, of, the, london, trip, jinnah, was, in, no, hurry, to, reach, an, agreement, considering, that, time, would, allow, him, to, gain, the, undivided, provinces, of, bengal, and, punjab, for, pakistan, but, these, wealthy, populous, provinces, had, sizeable, non, muslim, minorities, complicating, a, settlement, the, attlee, ministry, desired, a, rapid, british, departure, from, the, subcontinent, but, had, little, confidence, in, wavell, to, achieve, that, end, beginning, in, december, 1946, british, officials, began, looking, for, a, viceregal, successor, to, wavell, and, soon, fixed, on, admiral, lord, mountbatten, of, burma, a, war, leader, popular, among, conservatives, as, the, great, grandson, of, queen, victoria, and, among, labour, for, his, political, views, on, 20, february, 1947, attlee, announced, mountbatten, s, appointment, and, that, britain, would, transfer, power, in, india, not, later, than, june, 1948, mountbatten, took, office, as, viceroy, on, 24, march, 1947, two, days, after, his, arrival, in, india, by, then, the, congress, had, come, around, to, the, idea, of, partition, nehru, stated, in, 1960, the, truth, is, that, we, were, tired, men, and, we, were, getting, on, in, years, the, plan, for, partition, offered, a, way, out, and, we, took, it, leaders, of, the, congress, decided, that, having, loosely, tied, muslim, majority, provinces, as, part, of, a, future, india, was, not, worth, the, loss, of, the, powerful, government, at, the, centre, which, they, desired, however, the, congress, insisted, that, if, pakistan, were, to, become, independent, bengal, and, punjab, would, have, to, be, divided, mountbatten, had, been, warned, in, his, briefing, papers, that, jinnah, would, be, his, toughest, customer, who, had, proved, a, chronic, nuisance, because, no, one, in, this, country, had, so, far, gotten, into, jinnah, s, mind, the, men, met, over, six, days, beginning, on, 5, april, the, sessions, began, lightly, when, jinnah, photographed, between, louis, and, edwina, mountbatten, quipped, a, rose, between, two, thorns, which, the, viceroy, took, perhaps, gratuitously, as, evidence, that, the, muslim, leader, had, pre, planned, his, joke, but, had, expected, the, vicereine, to, stand, in, the, middle, mountbatten, was, not, favourably, impressed, with, jinnah, repeatedly, expressing, frustration, to, his, staff, about, jinnah, s, insistence, on, pakistan, in, the, face, of, all, argument, jinnah, feared, that, at, the, end, of, the, british, presence, in, the, subcontinent, they, would, turn, control, over, to, the, congress, dominated, constituent, assembly, putting, muslims, at, a, disadvantage, in, attempting, to, win, autonomy, he, demanded, that, mountbatten, divide, the, army, prior, to, independence, which, would, take, at, least, a, year, mountbatten, had, hoped, that, the, post, independence, arrangements, would, include, a, common, defence, force, but, jinnah, saw, it, as, essential, that, a, sovereign, state, should, have, its, own, forces, mountbatten, met, with, liaquat, the, day, of, his, final, session, with, jinnah, and, concluded, as, he, told, attlee, and, the, cabinet, in, may, that, it, had, become, clear, that, the, muslim, league, would, resort, to, arms, if, pakistan, in, some, form, were, not, conceded, the, viceroy, was, also, influenced, by, negative, muslim, reaction, to, the, constitutional, report, of, the, assembly, which, envisioned, broad, powers, for, the, post, independence, central, government, on, 2, june, 1947, the, final, plan, was, given, by, the, viceroy, to, indian, leaders, on, 15, august, the, british, would, turn, over, power, to, two, dominions, the, provinces, would, vote, on, whether, to, continue, in, the, existing, constituent, assembly, or, to, have, a, new, one, that, is, to, join, pakistan, bengal, and, punjab, would, also, vote, both, on, the, question, of, which, assembly, to, join, and, on, the, partition, a, boundary, commission, would, determine, the, final, lines, in, the, partitioned, provinces, plebiscites, would, take, place, in, the, north, west, frontier, province, which, did, not, have, a, league, government, despite, an, overwhelmingly, muslim, population, and, in, the, majority, muslim, sylhet, district, of, assam, adjacent, to, eastern, bengal, on, 3, june, mountbatten, nehru, jinnah, and, sikh, leader, baldev, singh, made, the, formal, announcement, by, radio, jinnah, concluded, his, address, with, pakistan, zindabad, long, live, pakistan, which, was, not, in, the, script, some, listeners, misunderstood, his, urdu, as, pakistan, s, in, the, bag, in, the, weeks, which, followed, punjab, and, bengal, cast, the, votes, which, resulted, in, partition, sylhet, and, the, n, w, f, p, voted, to, cast, their, lots, with, pakistan, a, decision, joined, by, the, assemblies, in, sind, and, baluchistan, on, 4, july, 1947, liaquat, asked, mountbatten, on, jinnah, s, behalf, to, recommend, to, the, british, king, george, vi, that, jinnah, be, appointed, pakistan, s, first, governor, general, this, request, angered, mountbatten, who, had, hoped, to, have, that, position, in, both, dominions, he, would, be, india, s, first, post, independence, governor, general, but, jinnah, felt, that, mountbatten, would, be, likely, to, favour, the, new, hindu, majority, state, because, of, his, closeness, to, nehru, in, addition, the, governor, general, would, initially, be, a, powerful, figure, and, jinnah, did, not, trust, anyone, else, to, take, that, office, although, the, boundary, commission, led, by, british, lawyer, sir, cyril, radcliffe, had, not, yet, reported, there, were, already, massive, movements, of, populations, between, the, nations, to, be, as, well, as, sectarian, violence, jinnah, arranged, to, sell, his, house, in, bombay, and, procured, a, new, one, in, karachi, on, 7, august, jinnah, with, his, sister, and, close, staff, flew, from, delhi, to, karachi, in, mountbatten, s, plane, and, as, the, plane, taxied, he, was, heard, to, murmur, that, s, the, end, of, that, on, 11, august, he, presided, over, the, new, constituent, assembly, for, pakistan, at, karachi, and, addressed, them, you, are, free, you, are, free, to, go, to, your, temples, you, are, free, to, go, to, your, mosques, or, to, any, other, place, of, worship, in, this, state, of, pakistan, you, may, belong, to, any, religion, or, caste, or, creed, that, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, business, of, the, state, i, think, we, should, keep, that, in, front, of, us, as, our, ideal, and, you, will, find, that, in, course, of, time, hindus, would, cease, to, be, hindus, and, muslims, would, cease, to, be, muslims, not, in, the, religious, sense, because, that, is, the, personal, faith, of, each, individual, but, in, the, political, sense, as, citizens, of, the, state, on, 14, august, pakistan, became, independent, jinnah, led, the, celebrations, in, karachi, one, observer, wrote, here, indeed, is, pakistan, s, king, emperor, archbishop, of, canterbury, speaker, and, prime, minister, concentrated, into, one, formidable, quaid, e, azam, the, radcliffe, commission, dividing, bengal, and, punjab, completed, its, work, and, reported, to, mountbatten, on, 12, august, the, last, viceroy, held, the, maps, until, the, 17th, not, wanting, to, spoil, the, independence, celebrations, in, both, nations, there, had, already, been, ethnically, charged, violence, and, movement, of, populations, publication, of, the, radcliffe, line, dividing, the, new, nations, sparked, mass, migration, murder, and, ethnic, cleansing, many, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, lines, fled, or, were, murdered, or, murdered, others, hoping, to, make, facts, on, the, ground, which, would, reverse, the, commission, s, verdict, radcliffe, wrote, in, his, report, that, he, knew, that, neither, side, would, be, happy, with, his, award, he, declined, his, fee, for, the, work, christopher, beaumont, radcliffe, s, private, secretary, later, wrote, that, mountbatten, must, take, the, blame, though, not, the, sole, blame, for, the, massacres, in, the, punjab, in, which, between, 500, 000, to, a, million, men, women, and, children, perished, jinnah, did, what, he, could, for, the, eight, million, people, who, migrated, to, pakistan, although, by, now, over, 70, and, frail, from, lung, ailments, he, travelled, across, west, pakistan, and, personally, supervised, the, provision, of, aid, according, to, ahmed, what, pakistan, needed, desperately, in, those, early, months, was, a, symbol, of, the, state, one, that, would, unify, people, and, give, them, the, courage, and, resolve, to, succeed, among, the, restive, regions, of, the, new, nation, was, the, north, west, frontier, province, the, referendum, there, in, july, 1947, had, been, tainted, by, low, turnout, as, less, than, 10, per, cent, of, the, population, were, allowed, to, vote, on, 22, august, 1947, just, after, a, week, of, becoming, governor, general, jinnah, dissolved, the, elected, government, of, khan, abdul, jabbar, khan, later, on, abdul, qayyum, khan, was, put, in, place, by, jinnah, in, the, pashtun, dominated, province, despite, him, being, a, kashmiri, on, 12, august, 1948, the, babrra, massacre, in, charsadda, occurred, resulting, in, the, death, of, 400, people, aligned, with, the, khudai, khidmatgar, movement, along, with, liaquat, and, abdur, rab, nishtar, jinnah, represented, pakistan, s, interests, in, the, division, council, to, appropriately, divide, public, assets, between, india, and, pakistan, pakistan, was, supposed, to, receive, one, sixth, of, the, pre, independence, government, s, assets, carefully, divided, by, agreement, even, specifying, how, many, sheets, of, paper, each, side, would, receive, the, new, indian, state, however, was, slow, to, deliver, hoping, for, the, collapse, of, the, nascent, pakistani, government, and, reunion, few, members, of, the, indian, civil, service, and, the, indian, police, service, had, chosen, pakistan, resulting, in, staff, shortages, partition, meant, that, for, some, farmers, the, markets, to, sell, their, crops, were, on, the, other, side, of, an, international, border, there, were, shortages, of, machinery, not, all, of, which, was, made, in, pakistan, in, addition, to, the, massive, refugee, problem, the, new, government, sought, to, save, abandoned, crops, establish, security, in, a, chaotic, situation, and, provide, basic, services, according, to, economist, yasmeen, niaz, mohiuddin, in, her, study, of, pakistan, although, pakistan, was, born, in, bloodshed, and, turmoil, it, survived, in, the, initial, and, difficult, months, after, partition, only, because, of, the, tremendous, sacrifices, made, by, its, people, and, the, selfless, efforts, of, its, great, leader, the, princely, states, of, india, were, advised, by, the, departing, british, to, choose, whether, to, join, pakistan, or, india, most, did, so, prior, to, independence, but, the, holdouts, contributed, to, what, have, become, lasting, divisions, between, the, two, nations, indian, leaders, were, angered, at, jinnah, s, attempts, to, convince, the, princes, of, jodhpur, udaipur, bhopal, and, indore, to, accede, to, pakistan, the, latter, three, princely, states, did, not, border, pakistan, jodhpur, bordered, it, and, had, both, a, hindu, majority, population, and, a, hindu, ruler, the, coastal, princely, state, of, junagadh, which, had, a, majority, hindu, population, did, accede, to, pakistan, in, september, 1947, with, its, ruler, s, dewan, sir, shah, nawaz, bhutto, personally, delivering, the, accession, papers, to, jinnah, but, two, of, three, vassal, states, that, were, subject, to, the, suzerainty, of, junagadh, mangrol, and, babariawad, declared, their, independence, from, junagadh, and, acceded, to, india, in, response, the, nawab, of, junagarh, militarily, occupied, the, two, states, subsequently, the, indian, army, occupied, the, principality, in, november, forcing, its, former, leaders, including, bhutto, to, flee, to, pakistan, beginning, the, politically, influential, bhutto, family, the, most, contentious, of, the, disputes, was, and, continues, to, be, that, over, the, princely, state, of, kashmir, it, had, a, muslim, majority, population, and, a, hindu, maharaja, sir, hari, singh, who, stalled, his, decision, on, which, nation, to, join, with, the, population, in, revolt, in, october, 1947, aided, by, pakistani, irregulars, the, maharaja, acceded, to, india, indian, troops, were, airlifted, in, jinnah, objected, to, this, action, and, ordered, that, pakistani, troops, move, into, kashmir, the, pakistani, army, was, still, commanded, by, british, officers, and, the, commanding, officer, general, sir, douglas, gracey, refused, the, order, stating, that, he, would, not, move, into, what, he, considered, the, territory, of, another, nation, without, approval, from, higher, authority, which, was, not, forthcoming, jinnah, withdrew, the, order, this, did, not, stop, the, violence, there, which, broke, into, the, first, india, pakistan, war, some, historians, allege, that, jinnah, s, courting, the, rulers, of, hindu, majority, states, and, his, gambit, with, junagadh, are, evidence, of, ill, intent, towards, india, as, jinnah, had, promoted, separation, by, religion, yet, tried, to, gain, the, accession, of, hindu, majority, states, in, his, book, patel, a, life, rajmohan, gandhi, asserts, that, jinnah, hoped, for, a, plebiscite, in, junagadh, knowing, pakistan, would, lose, in, the, hope, the, principle, would, be, established, for, kashmir, however, when, mountbatten, proposed, to, jinnah, that, in, all, the, princely, states, where, the, ruler, did, not, accede, to, a, dominion, corresponding, to, the, majority, population, which, would, have, included, junagadh, hyderabad, and, kashmir, the, accession, should, be, decided, by, an, impartial, reference, to, the, will, of, the, people, jinnah, rejected, the, offer, despite, the, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 47, issued, at, india, s, request, for, a, plebiscite, in, kashmir, after, the, withdrawal, of, pakistani, forces, this, has, never, occurred, in, january, 1948, the, indian, government, finally, agreed, to, pay, pakistan, its, share, of, british, india, s, assets, on, 15, january, 1948, the, partition, violence, stopped, by, 18, january, following, the, fast, by, mahatma, gandhi, with, religious, rioters, promising, gandhi, to, frown, upon, the, violence, only, days, later, on, 30, january, gandhi, was, assassinated, by, nathuram, godse, a, hindutva, activist, who, claimed, that, gandhi, was, pro, muslim, after, hearing, about, gandhi, s, murder, jinnah, publicly, made, a, brief, statement, of, condolence, calling, gandhi, one, of, the, greatest, men, produced, by, the, hindu, community, in, february, 1948, in, a, radio, talk, broadcast, addressed, to, the, people, of, the, us, jinnah, expressed, his, views, regarding, pakistan, s, constitution, to, be, in, the, following, way, the, constitution, of, pakistan, is, yet, to, be, framed, by, the, pakistan, constituent, assembly, i, do, not, know, what, the, ultimate, shape, of, the, constitution, is, going, to, be, but, i, am, sure, that, it, will, be, of, a, democratic, type, embodying, the, essential, principles, of, islam, today, these, are, as, applicable, in, actual, life, as, these, were, 1300, years, ago, islam, and, its, idealism, have, taught, us, democracy, it, has, taught, equality, of, man, justice, and, fair, play, to, everybody, we, are, the, inheritors, of, these, glorious, traditions, and, are, fully, alive, to, our, responsibilities, and, obligations, as, framers, of, the, future, constitution, of, pakistan, in, march, jinnah, despite, his, declining, health, made, his, only, post, independence, visit, to, east, pakistan, in, a, speech, before, a, crowd, estimated, at, 300, 000, jinnah, stated, in, english, that, urdu, alone, should, be, the, national, language, believing, a, single, language, was, needed, for, a, nation, to, remain, united, the, bengali, speaking, people, of, east, pakistan, strongly, opposed, this, policy, and, in, 1971, the, official, language, issue, was, a, factor, in, the, region, s, secession, to, form, the, country, of, bangladesh, from, the, 1930s, jinnah, suffered, from, tuberculosis, only, his, sister, and, a, few, others, close, to, him, were, aware, of, his, condition, jinnah, believed, public, knowledge, of, his, lung, ailments, would, hurt, him, politically, in, a, 1938, letter, he, wrote, to, a, supporter, that, you, must, have, read, in, the, papers, how, during, my, tours, i, suffered, which, was, not, because, there, was, anything, wrong, with, me, but, the, irregularities, and, over, strain, told, upon, my, health, many, years, later, mountbatten, stated, that, if, he, had, known, jinnah, was, so, physically, ill, he, would, have, stalled, hoping, jinnah, s, death, would, avert, partition, fatima, jinnah, later, wrote, even, in, his, hour, of, triumph, the, quaid, e, azam, was, gravely, ill, he, worked, in, a, frenzy, to, consolidate, pakistan, and, of, course, he, totally, neglected, his, health, jinnah, was, a, heavy, smoker, who, worked, with, a, tin, of, craven, a, cigarettes, at, his, desk, of, which, he, had, smoked, 50, or, more, a, day, for, the, previous, 30, years, as, well, as, a, box, of, cuban, cigars, as, his, health, got, worse, he, took, longer, and, longer, rest, breaks, in, the, private, wing, of, government, house, in, karachi, where, only, he, fatima, and, the, servants, were, allowed, in, june, 1948, he, and, fatima, flew, to, quetta, in, the, mountains, of, balochistan, where, the, weather, was, cooler, than, in, karachi, he, could, not, completely, rest, there, addressing, the, officers, at, the, command, and, staff, college, saying, you, along, with, the, other, forces, of, pakistan, are, the, custodians, of, the, life, property, and, honour, of, the, people, of, pakistan, he, returned, to, karachi, for, the, 1, july, opening, ceremony, for, the, state, bank, of, pakistan, at, which, he, spoke, a, reception, by, the, canadian, trade, commissioner, that, evening, in, honour, of, canada, s, dominion, day, was, the, last, public, event, he, attended, on, 6, july, 1948, jinnah, returned, to, quetta, but, at, the, advice, of, doctors, soon, journeyed, to, an, even, higher, retreat, at, ziarat, jinnah, had, always, been, reluctant, to, undergo, medical, treatment, but, realising, his, condition, was, getting, worse, the, pakistani, government, sent, the, best, doctors, it, could, find, to, treat, him, tests, confirmed, tuberculosis, and, also, showed, evidence, of, advanced, lung, cancer, he, was, treated, with, the, new, miracle, drug, of, streptomycin, but, it, did, not, help, jinnah, s, condition, continued, to, deteriorate, despite, the, eid, prayers, of, his, people, he, was, moved, to, the, lower, altitude, of, quetta, on, 13, august, the, eve, of, independence, day, for, which, a, ghost, written, statement, for, him, was, released, despite, an, increase, in, appetite, he, then, weighed, just, over, 36, kilograms, or, 79, pounds, it, was, clear, to, his, doctors, that, if, he, was, to, return, to, karachi, in, life, he, would, have, to, do, so, very, soon, jinnah, however, was, reluctant, to, go, not, wishing, his, aides, to, see, him, as, an, invalid, on, a, stretcher, by, 9, september, jinnah, had, also, developed, pneumonia, doctors, urged, him, to, return, to, karachi, where, he, could, receive, better, care, and, with, his, agreement, he, was, flown, there, on, the, morning, of, 11, september, dr, ilahi, bux, his, personal, physician, believed, that, jinnah, s, change, of, mind, was, caused, by, foreknowledge, of, death, the, plane, landed, at, karachi, that, afternoon, to, be, met, by, jinnah, s, limousine, and, an, ambulance, into, which, jinnah, s, stretcher, was, placed, the, ambulance, broke, down, on, the, road, into, town, and, the, governor, general, and, those, with, him, waited, for, another, to, arrive, he, could, not, be, placed, in, the, car, as, he, could, not, sit, up, they, waited, by, the, roadside, in, oppressive, heat, as, trucks, and, buses, passed, by, unsuitable, for, transporting, the, dying, man, and, with, their, occupants, not, knowing, of, jinnah, s, presence, after, an, hour, the, replacement, ambulance, came, and, transported, jinnah, to, government, house, arriving, there, over, two, hours, after, the, landing, jinnah, died, later, that, night, at, 10, 20, pm, at, his, home, in, karachi, on, 11, september, 1948, at, the, age, of, 71, just, over, a, year, after, pakistan, s, creation, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, stated, upon, jinnah, s, death, how, shall, we, judge, him, i, have, been, very, angry, with, him, often, during, the, past, years, but, now, there, is, no, bitterness, in, my, thought, of, him, only, a, great, sadness, for, all, that, has, been, he, succeeded, in, his, quest, and, gained, his, objective, but, at, what, a, cost, and, with, what, a, difference, from, what, he, had, imagined, jinnah, was, buried, on, 12, september, 1948, amid, official, mourning, in, pakistan, a, million, people, gathered, for, his, funeral, led, by, shabbir, ahmad, usmani, today, jinnah, rests, in, a, large, marble, mausoleum, mazar, e, quaid, in, karachi, after, jinnah, died, his, sister, fatima, asked, the, court, to, execute, jinnah, s, will, under, shia, islamic, law, this, subsequently, became, part, of, the, argument, in, pakistan, about, jinnah, s, religious, affiliation, iranian, american, academic, vali, nasr, claimed, that, jinnah, was, an, ismaili, by, birth, and, a, twelver, shia, by, confession, though, not, a, religiously, observant, man, in, a, 1970, legal, challenge, hussain, ali, ganji, walji, claimed, jinnah, had, converted, to, sunni, islam, witness, syed, sharifuddin, pirzada, stated, in, court, that, jinnah, converted, to, sunni, islam, in, 1901, when, his, sisters, married, sunnis, in, 1970, liaquat, ali, khan, and, fatima, jinnah, s, joint, affidavit, that, jinnah, was, shia, was, rejected, but, in, 1976, the, court, rejected, walji, s, claim, that, jinnah, was, sunni, effectively, implying, that, he, was, a, shia, in, 1984, a, high, court, bench, reversed, the, 1976, verdict, and, maintained, that, the, quaid, was, definitely, not, a, shia, which, suggested, that, jinnah, was, sunni, according, to, the, journalist, khaled, ahmed, jinnah, publicly, had, a, non, sectarian, stance, and, was, at, pains, to, gather, the, muslims, of, india, under, the, banner, of, a, general, muslim, faith, and, not, under, a, divisive, sectarian, identity, liaquat, h, merchant, jinnah, s, grandnephew, writes, that, the, quaid, was, not, a, shia, he, was, also, not, a, sunni, he, was, simply, a, muslim, an, eminent, lawyer, who, practised, in, the, bombay, high, court, until, 1940, testified, that, jinnah, used, to, pray, as, an, orthodox, sunni, according, to, akbar, ahmed, jinnah, became, a, firm, sunni, muslim, by, the, end, of, his, life, jinnah, s, legacy, is, pakistan, according, to, mohiuddin, he, was, and, continues, to, be, as, highly, honored, in, pakistan, as, george, washington, is, in, the, united, states, pakistan, owes, its, very, existence, to, his, drive, tenacity, and, judgment, jinnah, s, importance, in, the, creation, of, pakistan, was, monumental, and, immeasurable, american, historian, stanley, wolpert, giving, a, speech, in, honour, of, jinnah, in, 1998, deemed, him, pakistan, s, greatest, leader, according, to, jaswant, singh, with, jinnah, s, death, pakistan, lost, its, moorings, in, india, there, will, not, easily, arrive, another, gandhi, nor, in, pakistan, another, jinnah, malik, writes, as, long, as, jinnah, was, alive, he, could, persuade, and, even, pressure, regional, leaders, toward, greater, mutual, accommodation, but, after, his, death, the, lack, of, consensus, on, the, distribution, of, political, power, and, economic, resources, often, turned, controversial, according, to, mohiuddin, jinnah, s, death, deprived, pakistan, of, a, leader, who, could, have, enhanced, stability, and, democratic, governance, the, rocky, road, to, democracy, in, pakistan, and, the, relatively, smooth, one, in, india, can, in, some, measure, be, ascribed, to, pakistan, s, tragedy, of, losing, an, incorruptible, and, highly, revered, leader, so, soon, after, independence, his, birthday, is, observed, as, a, national, holiday, quaid, e, azam, day, in, pakistan, jinnah, earned, the, title, quaid, e, azam, meaning, great, leader, his, other, title, is, baba, e, qawm, father, of, the, nation, the, former, title, was, reportedly, given, to, jinnah, at, first, by, mian, ferozuddin, ahmed, it, became, an, official, title, by, effect, of, a, resolution, passed, on, 11, august, 1947, by, liaquat, ali, khan, in, the, constituent, assembly, of, pakistan, within, a, few, days, of, pakistan, s, creation, jinnah, s, name, was, read, in, the, sermon, at, mosques, as, amir, ul, millat, a, traditional, title, of, muslim, rulers, the, civil, awards, of, pakistan, includes, an, order, of, quaid, i, azam, the, jinnah, society, also, confers, the, jinnah, award, annually, to, a, person, that, renders, outstanding, and, meritorious, services, to, pakistan, and, its, people, jinnah, is, depicted, on, all, pakistani, rupee, currency, and, is, the, namesake, of, many, pakistani, public, institutions, the, former, quaid, i, azam, international, airport, in, karachi, now, called, the, jinnah, international, airport, is, pakistan, s, busiest, one, of, the, largest, streets, in, the, turkish, capital, ankara, cinnah, caddesi, is, named, after, him, as, is, the, mohammad, ali, jenah, expressway, in, tehran, iran, in, chicago, a, portion, of, devon, avenue, was, named, mohammed, ali, jinnah, way, a, section, of, coney, island, avenue, in, brooklyn, new, york, was, also, named, muhammad, ali, jinnah, way, in, honour, of, the, founder, of, pakistan, the, mazar, e, quaid, jinnah, s, mausoleum, is, among, karachi, s, notable, landmarks, the, jinnah, tower, in, guntur, andhra, pradesh, india, was, built, to, commemorate, jinnah, the, royalist, government, of, iran, also, released, a, stamp, commemorating, the, centennial, of, jinnah, s, birth, in, 1976, the, jinnah, mansion, in, malabar, hill, bombay, is, in, the, possession, of, the, government, of, india, but, the, issue, of, its, ownership, has, been, disputed, by, the, government, of, pakistan, jinnah, had, personally, requested, prime, minister, nehru, to, preserve, the, house, hoping, one, day, he, could, return, to, bombay, there, are, proposals, for, the, house, to, be, offered, to, the, government, of, pakistan, to, establish, a, consulate, in, the, city, as, a, goodwill, gesture, but, dina, wadia, had, also, staked, a, claim, on, the, property, there, is, a, considerable, amount, of, scholarship, on, jinnah, which, stems, from, pakistan, according, to, akbar, s, ahmed, it, is, not, widely, read, outside, the, country, and, usually, avoids, even, the, slightest, criticism, of, jinnah, according, to, ahmed, some, books, published, about, jinnah, outside, pakistan, mention, that, he, consumed, alcohol, but, this, is, omitted, from, books, published, inside, pakistan, ahmed, suggests, that, depicting, the, quaid, drinking, would, weaken, jinnah, s, islamic, identity, and, by, extension, pakistan, s, some, sources, allege, he, gave, up, alcohol, near, the, end, of, his, life, the, professor, maya, tudor, concluded, that, jinnah, could, not, be, described, as, a, practicing, muslim, given, his, consumption, of, pork, use, of, alcohol, and, usage, of, interest, on, the, other, hand, yahya, bakhtiar, who, observed, jinnah, at, close, quarters, concluded, that, jinnah, was, a, very, sincere, deeply, committed, and, dedicated, mussalman, according, to, historian, ayesha, jalal, while, there, is, a, tendency, towards, hagiography, in, the, pakistani, view, of, jinnah, in, india, he, is, viewed, negatively, ahmed, deems, jinnah, the, most, maligned, person, in, recent, indian, history, in, india, many, see, him, as, the, demon, who, divided, the, land, even, many, indian, muslims, see, jinnah, negatively, blaming, him, for, their, woes, as, a, minority, in, that, state, some, historians, such, as, jalal, and, h, m, seervai, assert, that, jinnah, never, wanted, the, partition, of, india, it, was, the, outcome, of, the, congress, leaders, being, unwilling, to, share, power, with, the, muslim, league, they, contend, that, jinnah, only, used, the, pakistan, demand, in, an, attempt, to, mobilise, support, to, obtain, significant, political, rights, for, muslims, francis, mudie, the, last, british, governor, of, sindh, in, jinnah, s, honour, once, said, in, judging, jinnah, we, must, remember, what, he, was, up, against, he, had, against, him, not, only, the, wealth, and, brains, of, the, hindus, but, also, nearly, the, whole, of, british, officialdom, and, most, of, the, home, politicians, who, made, the, great, mistake, of, refusing, to, take, pakistan, seriously, never, was, his, position, really, examined, muhammad, ali, jinnah, according, to, yasser, latif, hamdani, and, eamon, murphy, is, associated, with, his, call, for, direct, action, day, which, resulted, in, bloodshed, and, communal, violence, that, culminated, in, the, partition, of, india, and, the, creation, of, pakistan, this, incident, and, jinnah, s, role, according, to, these, authors, is, viewed, with, contempt, in, india, jinnah, has, gained, the, admiration, of, indian, nationalist, politicians, such, as, lal, krishna, advani, whose, comments, praising, jinnah, caused, an, uproar, in, his, bharatiya, janata, party, bjp, indian, politician, jaswant, singh, s, book, jinnah, india, partition, independence, 2009, caused, controversy, in, india, the, book, was, based, on, jinnah, s, ideology, and, alleged, that, nehru, s, desire, for, a, powerful, centre, led, to, partition, upon, the, book, release, singh, was, expelled, from, his, membership, of, bharatiya, janata, party, to, which, he, responded, that, bjp, is, narrow, minded, and, has, limited, thoughts, jinnah, was, the, central, figure, of, the, 1998, film, jinnah, which, was, based, on, jinnah, s, life, and, his, struggle, for, the, creation, of, pakistan, christopher, lee, who, portrayed, jinnah, called, his, performance, the, best, of, his, career, the, 1954, hector, bolitho, s, book, jinnah, creator, of, pakistan, prompted, fatima, jinnah, to, release, a, book, titled, my, brother, 1987, as, she, thought, that, bolitho, s, book, had, failed, to, express, the, political, aspects, of, jinnah, the, book, received, positive, reception, in, pakistan, jinnah, of, pakistan, 1984, by, stanley, wolpert, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, best, biographical, books, on, jinnah, the, view, of, jinnah, in, the, west, has, been, shaped, to, some, extent, by, his, portrayal, in, sir, richard, attenborough, s, 1982, film, gandhi, the, film, was, dedicated, to, nehru, and, mountbatten, and, was, given, considerable, support, by, nehru, s, daughter, the, indian, prime, minister, indira, gandhi, it, portrays, jinnah, played, by, alyque, padamsee, in, an, unflattering, light, who, seems, to, act, out, of, jealousy, of, gandhi, padamsee, later, stated, that, his, portrayal, was, not, historically, accurate, in, a, journal, article, on, pakistan, s, first, governor, general, historian, r, j, moore, wrote, that, jinnah, is, universally, recognised, as, central, to, the, creation, of, pakistan, stanley, wolpert, summarises, the, profound, effect, that, jinnah, had, on, the, world, few, individuals, significantly, alter, the, course, of, history, fewer, still, modify, the, map, of, the, world, hardly, anyone, can, be, credited, with, creating, a, nation, state, mohammad, ali, jinnah, did, all, three
