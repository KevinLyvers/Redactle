figure, during, the, scottish, enlightenment, seen, by, some, as, the, father, of, economics, or, the, father, of, capitalism, he, wrote, two, classic, works, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, 1759, and, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, the, latter, often, abbreviated, as, the, wealth, of, nations, is, considered, his, magnum, opus, and, the, first, modern, work, that, treats, economics, as, a, comprehensive, system, and, as, an, academic, discipline, smith, refuses, to, explain, the, distribution, of, wealth, and, power, in, terms, of, god, s, will, and, instead, appeals, to, natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental, and, technological, factors, and, the, interactions, among, them, among, other, economic, theories, the, work, introduced, smith, s, idea, of, absolute, advantage, smith, studied, social, philosophy, at, the, university, of, glasgow, and, at, balliol, college, oxford, where, he, was, one, of, the, first, students, to, benefit, from, scholarships, set, up, by, fellow, scot, john, snell, after, graduating, he, delivered, a, successful, series, of, public, lectures, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, leading, him, to, collaborate, with, david, hume, during, the, scottish, enlightenment, smith, obtained, a, professorship, at, glasgow, teaching, moral, philosophy, and, during, this, time, wrote, and, published, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, in, his, later, life, he, took, a, tutoring, position, that, allowed, him, to, travel, throughout, europe, where, he, met, other, intellectual, leaders, of, his, day, as, a, reaction, to, the, common, policy, of, protecting, national, markets, and, merchants, through, minimizing, imports, and, maximizing, exports, what, came, to, be, known, as, mercantilism, smith, laid, the, foundations, of, classical, free, market, economic, theory, the, wealth, of, nations, was, a, precursor, to, the, modern, academic, discipline, of, economics, in, this, and, other, works, he, developed, the, concept, of, division, of, labour, and, expounded, upon, how, rational, self, interest, and, competition, can, lead, to, economic, prosperity, smith, was, controversial, in, his, own, day, and, his, general, approach, and, writing, style, were, often, satirised, by, writers, such, as, horace, walpole, smith, was, born, in, kirkcaldy, in, fife, scotland, his, father, adam, smith, senior, was, a, scottish, writer, to, the, signet, senior, solicitor, advocate, and, prosecutor, judge, advocate, and, also, served, as, comptroller, of, the, customs, in, kirkcaldy, smith, s, mother, was, born, margaret, douglas, daughter, of, the, landed, robert, douglas, of, strathendry, also, in, fife, she, married, smith, s, father, in, 1720, two, months, before, smith, was, born, his, father, died, leaving, his, mother, a, widow, the, date, of, smith, s, baptism, into, the, church, of, scotland, at, kirkcaldy, was, 5, june, 1723, and, this, has, often, been, treated, as, if, it, were, also, his, date, of, birth, which, is, unknown, although, few, events, in, smith, s, early, childhood, are, known, the, scottish, journalist, john, rae, smith, s, biographer, recorded, that, smith, was, abducted, by, romani, at, the, age, of, three, and, released, when, others, went, to, rescue, him, smith, was, close, to, his, mother, who, probably, encouraged, him, to, pursue, his, scholarly, ambitions, he, attended, the, burgh, school, of, kirkcaldy, characterised, by, rae, as, one, of, the, best, secondary, schools, of, scotland, at, that, period, from, 1729, to, 1737, he, learned, latin, mathematics, history, and, writing, smith, entered, the, university, of, glasgow, at, age, 14, and, studied, moral, philosophy, under, francis, hutcheson, here, he, developed, his, passion, for, the, philosophical, concepts, of, reason, civilian, liberties, and, free, speech, in, 1740, he, was, the, graduate, scholar, presented, to, undertake, postgraduate, studies, at, balliol, college, oxford, under, the, snell, exhibition, smith, considered, the, teaching, at, glasgow, to, be, far, superior, to, that, at, oxford, which, he, found, intellectually, stifling, in, book, v, chapter, ii, of, the, wealth, of, nations, he, wrote, in, the, university, of, oxford, the, greater, part, of, the, public, professors, have, for, these, many, years, given, up, altogether, even, the, pretence, of, teaching, smith, is, also, reported, to, have, complained, to, friends, that, oxford, officials, once, discovered, him, reading, a, copy, of, david, hume, s, a, treatise, of, human, nature, and, they, subsequently, confiscated, his, book, and, punished, him, severely, for, reading, it, according, to, william, robert, scott, the, oxford, of, time, gave, little, if, any, help, towards, what, was, to, be, his, lifework, nevertheless, he, took, the, opportunity, while, at, oxford, to, teach, himself, several, subjects, by, reading, many, books, from, the, shelves, of, the, large, bodleian, library, when, smith, was, not, studying, on, his, own, his, time, at, oxford, was, not, a, happy, one, according, to, his, letters, near, the, end, of, his, time, there, he, began, suffering, from, shaking, fits, probably, the, symptoms, of, a, nervous, breakdown, he, left, oxford, university, in, 1746, before, his, scholarship, ended, in, book, v, of, the, wealth, of, nations, smith, comments, on, the, low, quality, of, instruction, and, the, meager, intellectual, activity, at, english, universities, when, compared, to, their, scottish, counterparts, he, attributes, this, both, to, the, rich, endowments, of, the, colleges, at, oxford, and, cambridge, which, made, the, income, of, professors, independent, of, their, ability, to, attract, students, and, to, the, fact, that, distinguished, men, of, letters, could, make, an, even, more, comfortable, living, as, ministers, of, the, church, of, england, smith, s, discontent, at, oxford, might, be, in, part, due, to, the, absence, of, his, beloved, teacher, in, glasgow, francis, hutcheson, who, was, well, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, prominent, lecturers, at, the, university, of, glasgow, in, his, day, and, earned, the, approbation, of, students, colleagues, and, even, ordinary, residents, with, the, fervor, and, earnestness, of, his, orations, which, he, sometimes, opened, to, the, public, his, lectures, endeavoured, not, merely, to, teach, philosophy, but, also, to, make, his, students, embody, that, philosophy, in, their, lives, appropriately, acquiring, the, epithet, the, preacher, of, philosophy, unlike, smith, hutcheson, was, not, a, system, builder, rather, his, magnetic, personality, and, method, of, lecturing, so, influenced, his, students, and, caused, the, greatest, of, those, to, reverentially, refer, to, him, as, the, never, to, be, forgotten, hutcheson, a, title, that, smith, in, all, his, correspondence, used, to, describe, only, two, people, his, good, friend, david, hume, and, influential, mentor, francis, hutcheson, smith, began, delivering, public, lectures, in, 1748, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, sponsored, by, the, philosophical, society, of, edinburgh, under, the, patronage, of, lord, kames, his, lecture, topics, included, rhetoric, and, belles, lettres, and, later, the, subject, of, the, progress, of, opulence, on, this, latter, topic, he, first, expounded, his, economic, philosophy, of, the, obvious, and, simple, system, of, natural, liberty, while, smith, was, not, adept, at, public, speaking, his, lectures, met, with, success, in, 1750, smith, met, the, philosopher, david, hume, who, was, his, senior, by, more, than, a, decade, in, their, writings, covering, history, politics, philosophy, economics, and, religion, smith, and, hume, shared, closer, intellectual, and, personal, bonds, than, with, other, important, figures, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, in, 1751, smith, earned, a, professorship, at, glasgow, university, teaching, logic, courses, and, in, 1752, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, philosophical, society, of, edinburgh, having, been, introduced, to, the, society, by, lord, kames, when, the, head, of, moral, philosophy, in, glasgow, died, the, next, year, smith, took, over, the, position, he, worked, as, an, academic, for, the, next, 13, years, which, he, characterised, as, by, far, the, most, useful, and, therefore, by, far, the, happiest, and, most, honorable, period, smith, published, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, in, 1759, embodying, some, of, his, glasgow, lectures, this, work, was, concerned, with, how, human, morality, depends, on, sympathy, between, agent, and, spectator, or, the, individual, and, other, members, of, society, smith, defined, mutual, sympathy, as, the, basis, of, moral, sentiments, he, based, his, explanation, not, on, a, special, moral, sense, as, the, third, lord, shaftesbury, and, hutcheson, had, done, nor, on, utility, as, hume, did, but, on, mutual, sympathy, a, term, best, captured, in, modern, parlance, by, the, 20th, century, concept, of, empathy, the, capacity, to, recognise, feelings, that, are, being, experienced, by, another, being, following, the, publication, of, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, smith, became, so, popular, that, many, wealthy, students, left, their, schools, in, other, countries, to, enroll, at, glasgow, to, learn, under, smith, at, this, time, smith, began, to, give, more, attention, to, jurisprudence, and, economics, in, his, lectures, and, less, to, his, theories, of, morals, for, example, smith, lectured, that, the, cause, of, increase, in, national, wealth, is, labour, rather, than, the, nation, s, quantity, of, gold, or, silver, which, is, the, basis, for, mercantilism, the, economic, theory, that, dominated, western, european, economic, policies, at, the, time, in, 1762, the, university, of, glasgow, conferred, on, smith, the, title, of, doctor, of, laws, ll, d, at, the, end, of, 1763, he, obtained, an, offer, from, british, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, charles, townshend, who, had, been, introduced, to, smith, by, david, hume, to, tutor, his, stepson, henry, scott, the, young, duke, of, buccleuch, as, preparation, for, a, career, in, international, politics, smith, resigned, from, his, professorship, in, 1764, to, take, the, tutoring, position, he, subsequently, attempted, to, return, the, fees, he, had, collected, from, his, students, because, he, had, resigned, partway, through, the, term, but, his, students, refused, smith, s, tutoring, job, entailed, touring, europe, with, scott, during, which, time, he, educated, scott, on, a, variety, of, subjects, he, was, paid, 300, per, year, plus, expenses, along, with, a, 300, per, year, pension, roughly, twice, his, former, income, as, a, teacher, smith, first, travelled, as, a, tutor, to, toulouse, france, where, he, stayed, for, a, year, and, a, half, according, to, his, own, account, he, found, toulouse, to, be, somewhat, boring, having, written, to, hume, that, he, had, begun, to, write, a, book, to, pass, away, the, time, after, touring, the, south, of, france, the, group, moved, to, geneva, where, smith, met, with, the, philosopher, voltaire, from, geneva, the, party, moved, to, paris, here, smith, met, american, publisher, and, diplomat, benjamin, franklin, who, a, few, years, later, would, lead, the, opposition, in, the, american, colonies, against, four, british, resolutions, from, charles, townshend, in, history, known, as, the, townshend, acts, which, threatened, american, colonial, self, government, and, imposed, revenue, duties, on, a, number, of, items, necessary, to, the, colonies, smith, discovered, the, physiocracy, school, founded, by, fran, ois, quesnay, and, discussed, with, their, intellectuals, physiocrats, were, opposed, to, mercantilism, the, dominating, economic, theory, of, the, time, illustrated, in, their, motto, laissez, faire, et, laissez, passer, le, monde, va, de, lui, m, me, let, do, and, let, pass, the, world, goes, on, by, itself, the, wealth, of, france, had, been, virtually, depleted, by, louis, xiv, and, louis, xv, in, ruinous, wars, and, was, further, exhausted, in, aiding, the, american, revolutionary, soldiers, against, the, british, given, that, the, british, economy, of, the, day, yielded, an, income, distribution, that, stood, in, contrast, to, that, which, existed, in, france, smith, concluded, that, with, all, its, imperfections, is, perhaps, the, nearest, approximation, to, the, truth, that, has, yet, been, published, upon, the, subject, of, political, economy, the, distinction, between, productive, versus, unproductive, labour, the, physiocratic, classe, steril, was, a, predominant, issue, in, the, development, and, understanding, of, what, would, become, classical, economic, theory, in, 1766, henry, scott, s, younger, brother, died, in, paris, and, smith, s, tour, as, a, tutor, ended, shortly, thereafter, smith, returned, home, that, year, to, kirkcaldy, and, he, devoted, much, of, the, next, decade, to, writing, his, magnum, opus, there, he, befriended, henry, moyes, a, young, blind, man, who, showed, precocious, aptitude, smith, secured, the, patronage, of, david, hume, and, thomas, reid, in, the, young, man, s, education, in, may, 1767, smith, was, elected, fellow, of, the, royal, society, of, london, and, was, elected, a, member, of, the, literary, club, in, 1775, the, wealth, of, nations, was, published, in, 1776, and, was, an, instant, success, selling, out, its, first, edition, in, only, six, months, in, 1778, smith, was, appointed, to, a, post, as, commissioner, of, customs, in, scotland, and, went, to, live, with, his, mother, who, died, in, 1784, in, panmure, house, in, edinburgh, s, canongate, five, years, later, as, a, member, of, the, philosophical, society, of, edinburgh, when, it, received, its, royal, charter, he, automatically, became, one, of, the, founding, members, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, from, 1787, to, 1789, he, occupied, the, honorary, position, of, lord, rector, of, the, university, of, glasgow, smith, died, in, the, northern, wing, of, panmure, house, in, edinburgh, on, 17, july, 1790, after, a, painful, illness, his, body, was, buried, in, the, canongate, kirkyard, on, his, deathbed, smith, expressed, disappointment, that, he, had, not, achieved, more, smith, s, literary, executors, were, two, friends, from, the, scottish, academic, world, the, physicist, and, chemist, joseph, black, and, the, pioneering, geologist, james, hutton, smith, left, behind, many, notes, and, some, unpublished, material, but, gave, instructions, to, destroy, anything, that, was, not, fit, for, publication, he, mentioned, an, early, unpublished, history, of, astronomy, as, probably, suitable, and, it, duly, appeared, in, 1795, along, with, other, material, such, as, essays, on, philosophical, subjects, smith, s, library, went, by, his, will, to, david, douglas, lord, reston, son, of, his, cousin, colonel, robert, douglas, of, strathendry, fife, who, lived, with, smith, it, was, eventually, divided, between, his, two, surviving, children, cecilia, margaret, mrs, cunningham, and, david, anne, mrs, bannerman, on, the, death, in, 1878, of, her, husband, the, reverend, w, b, cunningham, of, prestonpans, mrs, cunningham, sold, some, of, the, books, the, remainder, passed, to, her, son, professor, robert, oliver, cunningham, of, queen, s, college, belfast, who, presented, a, part, to, the, library, of, queen, s, college, after, his, death, the, remaining, books, were, sold, on, the, death, of, mrs, bannerman, in, 1879, her, portion, of, the, library, went, intact, to, the, new, college, of, the, free, church, in, edinburgh, and, the, collection, was, transferred, to, the, university, of, edinburgh, main, library, in, 1972, not, much, is, known, about, smith, s, personal, views, beyond, what, can, be, deduced, from, his, published, articles, his, personal, papers, were, destroyed, after, his, death, per, his, request, he, never, married, and, seems, to, have, maintained, a, close, relationship, with, his, mother, with, whom, he, lived, after, his, return, from, france, and, who, died, six, years, before, him, smith, was, described, by, several, of, his, contemporaries, and, biographers, as, comically, absent, minded, with, peculiar, habits, of, speech, and, gait, and, a, smile, of, inexpressible, benignity, he, was, known, to, talk, to, himself, a, habit, that, began, during, his, childhood, when, he, would, smile, in, rapt, conversation, with, invisible, companions, he, also, had, occasional, spells, of, imaginary, illness, and, he, is, reported, to, have, had, books, and, papers, placed, in, tall, stacks, in, his, study, according, to, one, story, smith, took, charles, townshend, on, a, tour, of, a, tanning, factory, and, while, discussing, free, trade, smith, walked, into, a, huge, tanning, pit, from, which, he, needed, help, to, escape, he, is, also, said, to, have, put, bread, and, butter, into, a, teapot, drunk, the, concoction, and, declared, it, to, be, the, worst, cup, of, tea, he, had, ever, had, according, to, another, account, smith, distractedly, went, out, walking, in, his, nightgown, and, ended, up, 15, miles, 24, km, outside, of, town, before, nearby, church, bells, brought, him, back, to, reality, james, boswell, who, was, a, student, of, smith, s, at, glasgow, university, and, later, knew, him, at, the, literary, club, says, that, smith, thought, that, speaking, about, his, ideas, in, conversation, might, reduce, the, sale, of, his, books, so, his, conversation, was, unimpressive, according, to, boswell, he, once, told, sir, joshua, reynolds, that, he, made, it, a, rule, when, in, company, never, to, talk, of, what, he, understood, smith, has, been, alternatively, described, as, someone, who, had, a, large, nose, bulging, eyes, a, protruding, lower, lip, a, nervous, twitch, and, a, speech, impediment, and, one, whose, countenance, was, manly, and, agreeable, smith, is, said, to, have, acknowledged, his, looks, at, one, point, saying, i, am, a, beau, in, nothing, but, my, books, smith, rarely, sat, for, portraits, so, almost, all, depictions, of, him, created, during, his, lifetime, were, drawn, from, memory, the, best, known, portraits, of, smith, are, the, profile, by, james, tassie, and, two, etchings, by, john, kay, the, line, engravings, produced, for, the, covers, of, 19th, century, reprints, of, the, wealth, of, nations, were, based, largely, on, tassie, s, medallion, considerable, scholarly, debate, has, occurred, about, the, nature, of, smith, s, religious, views, his, father, had, shown, a, strong, interest, in, christianity, and, belonged, to, the, moderate, wing, of, the, church, of, scotland, and, the, fact, he, received, the, snell, exhibition, suggests, that, he, may, have, gone, to, oxford, with, the, intention, of, pursuing, a, career, in, the, church, of, england, anglo, american, economist, ronald, coase, challenged, the, view, that, smith, was, a, deist, based, on, the, fact, that, smith, s, writings, never, explicitly, invoke, god, as, an, explanation, of, the, harmonies, of, the, natural, or, the, human, worlds, according, to, coase, though, smith, does, sometimes, refer, to, the, great, architect, of, the, universe, later, scholars, such, as, jacob, viner, have, very, much, exaggerated, the, extent, to, which, adam, smith, was, committed, to, a, belief, in, a, personal, god, a, belief, for, which, coase, finds, little, evidence, in, passages, such, as, the, one, in, the, wealth, of, nations, in, which, smith, writes, that, the, curiosity, of, mankind, about, the, great, phenomena, of, nature, such, as, the, generation, the, life, growth, and, dissolution, of, plants, and, animals, has, led, men, to, enquire, into, their, causes, and, that, superstition, first, attempted, to, satisfy, this, curiosity, by, referring, all, those, wonderful, appearances, to, the, immediate, agency, of, the, gods, philosophy, afterwards, endeavoured, to, account, for, them, from, more, familiar, causes, or, from, such, as, mankind, were, better, acquainted, with, than, the, agency, of, the, gods, some, authors, argue, that, smith, s, social, and, economic, philosophy, is, inherently, theological, and, that, his, entire, model, of, social, order, is, logically, dependent, on, the, notion, of, god, s, action, in, nature, brendan, long, argues, that, smith, was, a, theist, whereas, according, to, professor, gavin, kennedy, smith, was, in, some, sense, a, christian, smith, was, also, a, close, friend, of, david, hume, who, despite, debate, about, his, religious, views, in, modern, scholarship, was, commonly, characterised, in, his, own, time, as, an, atheist, the, publication, in, 1777, of, smith, s, letter, to, william, strahan, in, which, he, described, hume, s, courage, in, the, face, of, death, in, spite, of, his, irreligiosity, attracted, considerable, controversy, in, 1759, smith, published, his, first, work, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, sold, by, co, publishers, andrew, millar, of, london, and, alexander, kincaid, of, edinburgh, smith, continued, making, extensive, revisions, to, the, book, until, his, death, although, the, wealth, of, nations, is, widely, regarded, as, smith, s, most, influential, work, smith, himself, is, believed, to, have, considered, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, to, be, a, superior, work, in, the, work, smith, critically, examines, the, moral, thinking, of, his, time, and, suggests, that, conscience, arises, from, dynamic, and, interactive, social, relationships, through, which, people, seek, mutual, sympathy, of, sentiments, his, goal, in, writing, the, work, was, to, explain, the, source, of, mankind, s, ability, to, form, moral, judgment, given, that, people, begin, life, with, no, moral, sentiments, at, all, smith, proposes, a, theory, of, sympathy, in, which, the, act, of, observing, others, and, seeing, the, judgments, they, form, of, both, others, and, oneself, makes, people, aware, of, themselves, and, how, others, perceive, their, behaviour, the, feedback, received, by, an, individual, from, perceiving, or, imagining, others, judgment, creates, an, incentive, to, achieve, mutual, sympathy, of, sentiments, with, them, and, leads, people, to, develop, habits, and, then, principles, of, behaviour, which, come, to, constitute, one, s, conscience, some, scholars, have, perceived, a, conflict, between, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, and, the, wealth, of, nations, the, former, emphasises, sympathy, for, others, while, the, latter, focuses, on, the, role, of, self, interest, in, recent, years, however, some, scholars, of, smith, s, work, have, argued, that, no, contradiction, exists, they, contend, that, in, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, smith, develops, a, theory, of, psychology, in, which, individuals, seek, the, approval, of, the, impartial, spectator, as, a, result, of, a, natural, desire, to, have, outside, observers, sympathise, with, their, sentiments, rather, than, viewing, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, and, the, wealth, of, nations, as, presenting, incompatible, views, of, human, nature, some, smith, scholars, regard, the, works, as, emphasising, different, aspects, of, human, nature, that, vary, depending, on, the, situation, in, the, first, part, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, he, laid, down, the, foundation, of, his, vision, of, humanity, and, society, in, the, second, the, wealth, of, nations, he, elaborated, on, the, virtue, of, prudence, which, for, him, meant, the, relations, between, people, in, the, private, sphere, of, the, economy, it, was, his, plan, to, further, elaborate, on, the, virtue, of, justice, in, the, third, book, otteson, argues, that, both, books, are, newtonian, in, their, methodology, and, deploy, a, similar, market, model, for, explaining, the, creation, and, development, of, large, scale, human, social, orders, including, morality, economics, as, well, as, language, ekelund, and, hebert, offer, a, differing, view, observing, that, self, interest, is, present, in, both, works, and, that, in, the, former, sympathy, is, the, moral, faculty, that, holds, self, interest, in, check, whereas, in, the, latter, competition, is, the, economic, faculty, that, restrains, self, interest, disagreement, exists, between, classical, and, neoclassical, economists, about, the, central, message, of, smith, s, most, influential, work, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, neoclassical, economists, emphasise, smith, s, invisible, hand, a, concept, mentioned, in, the, middle, of, his, work, book, iv, chapter, ii, and, classical, economists, believe, that, smith, stated, his, programme, for, promoting, the, wealth, of, nations, in, the, first, sentences, which, attributes, the, growth, of, wealth, and, prosperity, to, the, division, of, labour, he, elaborated, on, the, virtue, of, prudence, which, for, him, meant, the, relations, between, people, in, the, private, sphere, of, the, economy, it, was, his, plan, to, further, elaborate, on, the, virtue, of, justice, in, the, third, book, smith, used, the, term, the, invisible, hand, in, history, of, astronomy, referring, to, the, invisible, hand, of, jupiter, and, once, in, each, of, his, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, 1759, and, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, this, last, statement, about, an, invisible, hand, has, been, interpreted, in, numerous, ways, as, every, individual, therefore, endeavours, as, much, as, he, can, both, to, employ, his, capital, in, the, support, of, domestic, industry, and, so, to, direct, that, industry, that, its, produce, may, be, of, the, greatest, value, every, individual, necessarily, labours, to, render, the, annual, revenue, of, the, society, as, great, as, he, can, he, generally, indeed, neither, intends, to, promote, the, public, interest, nor, knows, how, much, he, is, promoting, it, by, preferring, the, support, of, domestic, to, that, of, foreign, industry, he, intends, only, his, own, security, and, by, directing, that, industry, in, such, a, manner, as, its, produce, may, be, of, the, greatest, value, he, intends, only, his, own, gain, and, he, is, in, this, as, in, many, other, cases, led, by, an, invisible, hand, to, promote, an, end, which, was, no, part, of, his, intention, nor, is, it, always, the, worse, for, the, society, that, it, was, no, part, of, it, by, pursuing, his, own, interest, he, frequently, promotes, that, of, the, society, more, effectually, than, when, he, really, intends, to, promote, it, i, have, never, known, much, good, done, by, those, who, affected, to, trade, for, the, public, good, it, is, an, affectation, indeed, not, very, common, among, merchants, and, very, few, words, need, be, employed, in, dissuading, them, from, it, those, who, regard, that, statement, as, smith, s, central, message, also, quote, frequently, smith, s, dictum, it, is, not, from, the, benevolence, of, the, butcher, the, brewer, or, the, baker, that, we, expect, our, dinner, but, from, their, regard, to, their, own, interest, we, address, ourselves, not, to, their, humanity, but, to, their, self, love, and, never, talk, to, them, of, our, own, necessities, but, of, their, advantages, however, in, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, he, had, a, more, sceptical, approach, to, self, interest, as, driver, of, behaviour, how, selfish, soever, man, may, be, supposed, there, are, evidently, some, principles, in, his, nature, which, interest, him, in, the, fortune, of, others, and, render, their, happiness, necessary, to, him, though, he, derives, nothing, from, it, except, the, pleasure, of, seeing, it, in, relation, to, mandeville, s, contention, that, private, vices, may, be, turned, into, public, benefits, smith, s, belief, that, when, an, individual, pursues, his, self, interest, under, conditions, of, justice, he, unintentionally, promotes, the, good, of, society, self, interested, competition, in, the, free, market, he, argued, would, tend, to, benefit, society, as, a, whole, by, keeping, prices, low, while, still, building, in, an, incentive, for, a, wide, variety, of, goods, and, services, nevertheless, he, was, wary, of, businessmen, and, warned, of, their, conspiracy, against, the, public, or, in, some, other, contrivance, to, raise, prices, again, and, again, smith, warned, of, the, collusive, nature, of, business, interests, which, may, form, cabals, or, monopolies, fixing, the, highest, price, which, can, be, squeezed, out, of, the, buyers, smith, also, warned, that, a, business, dominated, political, system, would, allow, a, conspiracy, of, businesses, and, industry, against, consumers, with, the, former, scheming, to, influence, politics, and, legislation, smith, states, that, the, interest, of, manufacturers, and, merchants, in, any, particular, branch, of, trade, or, manufactures, is, always, in, some, respects, different, from, and, even, opposite, to, that, of, the, public, the, proposal, of, any, new, law, or, regulation, of, commerce, which, comes, from, this, order, ought, always, to, be, listened, to, with, great, precaution, and, ought, never, be, adopted, till, after, having, been, long, and, carefully, examined, not, only, with, the, most, scrupulous, but, with, the, most, suspicious, attention, thus, smith, s, chief, worry, seems, to, be, when, business, is, given, special, protections, or, privileges, from, government, by, contrast, in, the, absence, of, such, special, political, favours, he, believed, that, business, activities, were, generally, beneficial, to, the, whole, society, it, is, the, great, multiplication, of, the, production, of, all, the, different, arts, in, consequence, of, the, division, of, labour, which, occasions, in, a, well, governed, society, that, universal, opulence, which, extends, itself, to, the, lowest, ranks, of, the, people, every, workman, has, a, great, quantity, of, his, own, work, to, dispose, of, beyond, what, he, himself, has, occasion, for, and, every, other, workman, being, exactly, in, the, same, situation, he, is, enabled, to, exchange, a, great, quantity, of, his, own, goods, for, a, great, quantity, or, what, comes, to, the, same, thing, for, the, price, of, a, great, quantity, of, theirs, he, supplies, them, abundantly, with, what, they, have, occasion, for, and, they, accommodate, him, as, amply, with, what, he, has, occasion, for, and, a, general, plenty, diffuses, itself, through, all, the, different, ranks, of, society, the, wealth, of, nations, i, i, 10, the, neoclassical, interest, in, smith, s, statement, about, an, invisible, hand, originates, in, the, possibility, of, seeing, it, as, a, precursor, of, neoclassical, economics, and, its, concept, of, general, equilibrium, samuelson, s, economics, refers, six, times, to, smith, s, invisible, hand, to, emphasise, this, connection, samuelson, quotes, smith, s, invisible, hand, statement, substituting, general, interest, for, public, interest, samuelson, concludes, smith, was, unable, to, prove, the, essence, of, his, invisible, hand, doctrine, indeed, until, the, 1940s, no, one, knew, how, to, prove, even, to, state, properly, the, kernel, of, truth, in, this, proposition, about, perfectly, competitive, market, conversely, classical, economists, see, in, smith, s, first, sentences, his, programme, to, promote, the, wealth, of, nations, using, the, physiocratical, concept, of, the, economy, as, a, circular, process, to, secure, growth, the, inputs, of, period, 2, must, exceed, the, inputs, of, period, 1, therefore, those, outputs, of, period, 1, which, are, not, used, or, usable, as, inputs, of, period, 2, are, regarded, as, unproductive, labour, as, they, do, not, contribute, to, growth, this, is, what, smith, had, heard, in, france, from, among, others, fran, ois, quesnay, whose, ideas, smith, was, so, impressed, by, that, he, might, have, dedicated, the, wealth, of, nations, to, him, had, he, not, died, beforehand, to, this, french, insight, that, unproductive, labour, should, be, reduced, to, use, labour, more, productively, smith, added, his, own, proposal, that, productive, labour, should, be, made, even, more, productive, by, deepening, the, division, of, labour, smith, argued, that, deepening, the, division, of, labour, under, competition, leads, to, greater, productivity, which, leads, to, lower, prices, and, thus, an, increasing, standard, of, living, general, plenty, and, universal, opulence, for, all, extended, markets, and, increased, production, lead, to, the, continuous, reorganisation, of, production, and, the, invention, of, new, ways, of, producing, which, in, turn, lead, to, further, increased, production, lower, prices, and, improved, standards, of, living, smith, s, central, message, is, therefore, that, under, dynamic, competition, a, growth, machine, secures, the, wealth, of, nations, smith, s, argument, predicted, britain, s, evolution, as, the, workshop, of, the, world, underselling, and, outproducing, all, its, competitors, the, opening, sentences, of, the, wealth, of, nations, summarise, this, policy, the, annual, labour, of, every, nation, is, the, fund, which, originally, supplies, it, with, all, the, necessaries, and, conveniences, of, life, which, it, annually, consumes, his, produce, bears, a, greater, or, smaller, proportion, to, the, number, of, those, who, are, to, consume, it, ut, this, proportion, must, in, every, nation, be, regulated, by, two, different, circumstances, however, smith, added, that, the, abundance, or, scantiness, of, this, supply, too, seems, to, depend, more, upon, the, former, of, those, two, circumstances, than, upon, the, latter, shortly, before, his, death, smith, had, nearly, all, his, manuscripts, destroyed, in, his, last, years, he, seemed, to, have, been, planning, two, major, treatises, one, on, the, theory, and, history, of, law, and, one, on, the, sciences, and, arts, the, posthumously, published, essays, on, philosophical, subjects, a, history, of, astronomy, down, to, smith, s, own, era, plus, some, thoughts, on, ancient, physics, and, metaphysics, probably, contain, parts, of, what, would, have, been, the, latter, treatise, lectures, on, jurisprudence, were, notes, taken, from, smith, s, early, lectures, plus, an, early, draft, of, the, wealth, of, nations, published, as, part, of, the, 1976, glasgow, edition, of, the, works, and, correspondence, of, smith, other, works, including, some, published, posthumously, include, lectures, on, justice, police, revenue, and, arms, 1763, first, published, in, 1896, and, essays, on, philosophical, subjects, 1795, the, wealth, of, nations, was, a, precursor, to, the, modern, academic, discipline, of, economics, in, this, and, other, works, smith, expounded, how, rational, self, interest, and, competition, can, lead, to, economic, prosperity, smith, was, controversial, in, his, own, day, and, his, general, approach, and, writing, style, were, often, satirised, by, tory, writers, in, the, moralising, tradition, of, hogarth, and, swift, as, a, discussion, at, the, university, of, winchester, suggests, in, 2005, the, wealth, of, nations, was, named, among, the, 100, best, scottish, books, of, all, time, in, light, of, the, arguments, put, forward, by, smith, and, other, economic, theorists, in, britain, academic, belief, in, mercantilism, began, to, decline, in, britain, in, the, late, 18th, century, during, the, industrial, revolution, britain, embraced, free, trade, and, smith, s, laissez, faire, economics, and, via, the, british, empire, used, its, power, to, spread, a, broadly, liberal, economic, model, around, the, world, characterised, by, open, markets, and, relatively, barrier, free, domestic, and, international, trade, george, stigler, attributes, to, smith, the, most, important, substantive, proposition, in, all, of, economics, it, is, that, under, competition, owners, of, resources, for, example, labour, land, and, capital, will, use, them, most, profitably, resulting, in, an, equal, rate, of, return, in, equilibrium, for, all, uses, adjusted, for, apparent, differences, arising, from, such, factors, as, training, trust, hardship, and, unemployment, paul, samuelson, finds, in, smith, s, pluralist, use, of, supply, and, demand, as, applied, to, wages, rents, and, profit, a, valid, and, valuable, anticipation, of, the, general, equilibrium, modelling, of, walras, a, century, later, smith, s, allowance, for, wage, increases, in, the, short, and, intermediate, term, from, capital, accumulation, and, invention, contrasted, with, malthus, ricardo, and, karl, marx, in, their, propounding, a, rigid, subsistence, wage, theory, of, labour, supply, joseph, schumpeter, criticised, smith, for, a, lack, of, technical, rigour, yet, he, argued, that, this, enabled, smith, s, writings, to, appeal, to, wider, audiences, his, very, limitation, made, for, success, had, he, been, more, brilliant, he, would, not, have, been, taken, so, seriously, had, he, dug, more, deeply, had, he, unearthed, more, recondite, truth, had, he, used, more, difficult, and, ingenious, methods, he, would, not, have, been, understood, but, he, had, no, such, ambitions, in, fact, he, disliked, whatever, went, beyond, plain, common, sense, he, never, moved, above, the, heads, of, even, the, dullest, readers, he, led, them, on, gently, encouraging, them, by, trivialities, and, homely, observations, making, them, feel, comfortable, all, along, classical, economists, presented, competing, theories, to, those, of, smith, termed, the, labour, theory, of, value, later, marxian, economics, descending, from, classical, economics, also, use, smith, s, labour, theories, in, part, the, first, volume, of, karl, marx, s, major, work, das, kapital, was, published, in, german, in, 1867, in, it, marx, focused, on, the, labour, theory, of, value, and, what, he, considered, to, be, the, exploitation, of, labour, by, capital, the, labour, theory, of, value, held, that, the, value, of, a, thing, was, determined, by, the, labour, that, went, into, its, production, this, contrasts, with, the, modern, contention, of, neoclassical, economics, that, the, value, of, a, thing, is, determined, by, what, one, is, willing, to, give, up, to, obtain, the, thing, the, body, of, theory, later, termed, neoclassical, economics, or, marginalism, formed, from, about, 1870, to, 1910, the, term, economics, was, popularised, by, such, neoclassical, economists, as, alfred, marshall, as, a, concise, synonym, for, economic, science, and, a, substitute, for, the, earlier, broader, term, political, economy, used, by, smith, this, corresponded, to, the, influence, on, the, subject, of, mathematical, methods, used, in, the, natural, sciences, neoclassical, economics, systematised, supply, and, demand, as, joint, determinants, of, price, and, quantity, in, market, equilibrium, affecting, both, the, allocation, of, output, and, the, distribution, of, income, it, dispensed, with, the, labour, theory, of, value, of, which, smith, was, most, famously, identified, with, in, classical, economics, in, favour, of, a, marginal, utility, theory, of, value, on, the, demand, side, and, a, more, general, theory, of, costs, on, the, supply, side, the, bicentennial, anniversary, of, the, publication, of, the, wealth, of, nations, was, celebrated, in, 1976, resulting, in, increased, interest, for, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, and, his, other, works, throughout, academia, after, 1976, smith, was, more, likely, to, be, represented, as, the, author, of, both, the, wealth, of, nations, and, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, and, thereby, as, the, founder, of, a, moral, philosophy, and, the, science, of, economics, his, homo, economicus, or, economic, man, was, also, more, often, represented, as, a, moral, person, additionally, economists, david, levy, and, sandra, peart, in, the, secret, history, of, the, dismal, science, point, to, his, opposition, to, hierarchy, and, beliefs, in, inequality, including, racial, inequality, and, provide, additional, support, for, those, who, point, to, smith, s, opposition, to, slavery, colonialism, and, empire, emphasised, also, are, smith, s, statements, of, the, need, for, high, wages, for, the, poor, and, the, efforts, to, keep, wages, low, in, the, vanity, of, the, philosopher, from, equality, to, hierarchy, in, postclassical, economics, peart, and, levy, also, cite, smith, s, view, that, a, common, street, porter, was, not, intellectually, inferior, to, a, philosopher, and, point, to, the, need, for, greater, appreciation, of, the, public, views, in, discussions, of, science, and, other, subjects, now, considered, to, be, technical, they, also, cite, smith, s, opposition, to, the, often, expressed, view, that, science, is, superior, to, common, sense, smith, also, explained, the, relationship, between, growth, of, private, property, and, civil, government, men, may, live, together, in, society, with, some, tolerable, degree, of, security, though, there, is, no, civil, magistrate, to, protect, them, from, the, injustice, of, those, passions, but, avarice, and, ambition, in, the, rich, in, the, poor, the, hatred, of, labour, and, the, love, of, present, ease, and, enjoyment, are, the, passions, which, prompt, to, invade, property, passions, much, more, steady, in, their, operation, and, much, more, universal, in, their, influence, wherever, there, is, great, property, there, is, great, inequality, for, one, very, rich, man, there, must, be, at, least, five, hundred, poor, and, the, affluence, of, the, few, supposes, the, indigence, of, the, many, the, affluence, of, the, rich, excites, the, indignation, of, the, poor, who, are, often, both, driven, by, want, and, prompted, by, envy, to, invade, his, possessions, it, is, only, under, the, shelter, of, the, civil, magistrate, that, the, owner, of, that, valuable, property, which, is, acquired, by, the, labour, of, many, years, or, perhaps, of, many, successive, generations, can, sleep, a, single, night, in, security, he, is, at, all, times, surrounded, by, unknown, enemies, whom, though, he, never, provoked, he, can, never, appease, and, from, whose, injustice, he, can, be, protected, only, by, the, powerful, arm, of, the, civil, magistrate, continually, held, up, to, chastise, it, the, acquisition, of, valuable, and, extensive, property, therefore, necessarily, requires, the, establishment, of, civil, government, where, there, is, no, property, or, at, least, none, that, exceeds, the, value, of, two, or, three, days, labour, civil, government, is, not, so, necessary, civil, government, supposes, a, certain, subordination, but, as, the, necessity, of, civil, government, gradually, grows, up, with, the, acquisition, of, valuable, property, so, the, principal, causes, which, naturally, introduce, subordination, gradually, grow, up, with, the, growth, of, that, valuable, property, men, of, inferior, wealth, combine, to, defend, those, of, superior, wealth, in, the, possession, of, their, property, in, order, that, men, of, superior, wealth, may, combine, to, defend, them, in, the, possession, of, theirs, all, the, inferior, shepherds, and, herdsmen, feel, that, the, security, of, their, own, herds, and, flocks, depends, upon, the, security, of, those, of, the, great, shepherd, or, herdsman, that, the, maintenance, of, their, lesser, authority, depends, upon, that, of, his, greater, authority, and, that, upon, their, subordination, to, him, depends, his, power, of, keeping, their, inferiors, in, subordination, to, them, they, constitute, a, sort, of, little, nobility, who, feel, themselves, interested, to, defend, the, property, and, to, support, the, authority, of, their, own, little, sovereign, in, order, that, he, may, be, able, to, defend, their, property, and, to, support, their, authority, civil, government, so, far, as, it, is, instituted, for, the, security, of, property, is, in, reality, instituted, for, the, defence, of, the, rich, against, the, poor, or, of, those, who, have, some, property, against, those, who, have, none, at, all, smith, opposed, empire, he, challenged, ideas, that, colonies, were, key, to, british, prosperity, and, power, he, rejected, that, other, cultures, such, as, china, and, india, were, culturally, and, developmentally, inferior, to, europe, while, he, favoured, commercial, society, he, did, not, support, radical, social, change, and, the, imposition, of, commercial, society, on, other, societies, he, proposed, that, colonies, be, given, independence, or, that, full, political, rights, be, extended, to, colonial, subjects, smith, s, chapter, on, colonies, in, turn, would, help, shape, british, imperial, debates, from, the, mid, 19th, century, onward, the, wealth, of, nations, would, become, an, ambiguous, text, regarding, the, imperial, question, in, his, chapter, on, colonies, smith, pondered, how, to, solve, the, crisis, developing, across, the, atlantic, among, the, empire, s, 13, american, colonies, he, offered, two, different, proposals, for, easing, tensions, the, first, proposal, called, for, giving, the, colonies, their, independence, and, by, thus, parting, on, a, friendly, basis, britain, would, be, able, to, develop, and, maintain, a, free, trade, relationship, with, them, and, possibly, even, an, informal, military, alliance, smith, s, second, proposal, called, for, a, theoretical, imperial, federation, that, would, bring, the, colonies, and, the, metropole, closer, together, through, an, imperial, parliamentary, system, and, imperial, free, trade, smith, s, most, prominent, disciple, in, 19th, century, britain, peace, advocate, richard, cobden, preferred, the, first, proposal, cobden, would, lead, the, anti, corn, law, league, in, overturning, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, shifting, britain, to, a, policy, of, free, trade, and, empire, on, the, cheap, for, decades, to, come, this, hands, off, approach, toward, the, british, empire, would, become, known, as, cobdenism, or, the, manchester, school, by, the, turn, of, the, century, however, advocates, of, smith, s, second, proposal, such, as, joseph, shield, nicholson, would, become, ever, more, vocal, in, opposing, cobdenism, calling, instead, for, imperial, federation, as, marc, william, palen, notes, on, the, one, hand, adam, smith, s, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, cobdenite, adherents, used, his, theories, to, argue, for, gradual, imperial, devolution, and, empire, on, the, cheap, on, the, other, various, proponents, of, imperial, federation, throughout, the, british, world, sought, to, use, smith, s, theories, to, overturn, the, predominant, cobdenite, hands, off, imperial, approach, and, instead, with, a, firm, grip, bring, the, empire, closer, than, ever, before, smith, s, ideas, thus, played, an, important, part, in, subsequent, debates, over, the, british, empire, smith, has, been, commemorated, in, the, uk, on, banknotes, printed, by, two, different, banks, his, portrait, has, appeared, since, 1981, on, the, 50, notes, issued, by, the, clydesdale, bank, in, scotland, and, in, march, 2007, smith, s, image, also, appeared, on, the, new, series, of, 20, notes, issued, by, the, bank, of, england, making, him, the, first, scotsman, to, feature, on, an, english, banknote, a, large, scale, memorial, of, smith, by, alexander, stoddart, was, unveiled, on, 4, july, 2008, in, edinburgh, it, is, a, 10, foot, 3, 0, m, tall, bronze, sculpture, and, it, stands, above, the, royal, mile, outside, st, giles, cathedral, in, parliament, square, near, the, mercat, cross, 20th, century, sculptor, jim, sanborn, best, known, for, the, kryptos, sculpture, at, the, united, states, central, intelligence, agency, has, created, multiple, pieces, which, feature, smith, s, work, at, central, connecticut, state, university, is, circulating, capital, a, tall, cylinder, which, features, an, extract, from, the, wealth, of, nations, on, the, lower, half, and, on, the, upper, half, some, of, the, same, text, but, represented, in, binary, code, at, the, university, of, north, carolina, at, charlotte, outside, the, belk, college, of, business, administration, is, adam, smith, s, spinning, top, another, smith, sculpture, is, at, cleveland, state, university, he, also, appears, as, the, narrator, in, the, 2013, play, the, low, road, centred, on, a, proponent, on, laissez, faire, economics, in, the, late, 18th, century, but, dealing, obliquely, with, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, the, recession, which, followed, in, the, premiere, production, he, was, portrayed, by, bill, paterson, a, bust, of, smith, is, in, the, hall, of, heroes, of, the, national, wallace, monument, in, stirling, five, paving, stones, displaying, quotations, from, smith, s, works, were, unveiled, in, december, 2023, in, the, high, street, glasgow, the, stones, were, commissioned, by, the, university, of, glasgow, to, mark, the, 300th, anniversary, of, smith, s, birth, adam, smith, resided, at, panmure, house, from, 1778, to, 1790, in, 2008, the, house, was, purchased, by, the, edinburgh, business, school, at, heriot, watt, university, and, funds, were, raised, for, its, restoration, in, 2018, it, was, formally, opened, as, a, study, centre, in, smith, s, honour, smith, has, been, celebrated, by, advocates, of, free, market, policies, as, the, founder, of, free, market, economics, a, view, reflected, in, the, naming, of, bodies, such, as, the, adam, smith, institute, in, london, multiple, entities, known, as, the, adam, smith, society, including, an, historical, italian, organisation, and, the, u, s, based, adam, smith, society, and, the, australian, adam, smith, club, and, in, terms, such, as, the, adam, smith, necktie, former, us, federal, reserve, chairman, alan, greenspan, argues, that, while, smith, did, not, coin, the, term, laissez, faire, it, was, left, to, adam, smith, to, identify, the, more, general, set, of, principles, that, brought, conceptual, clarity, to, the, seeming, chaos, of, market, transactions, greenspan, continues, that, the, wealth, of, nations, was, one, of, the, great, achievements, in, human, intellectual, history, p, j, o, rourke, describes, smith, as, the, founder, of, free, market, economics, nobel, laureate, economist, milton, friedman, believed, in, 1976, 200, years, after, the, publishing, of, the, wealth, of, nations, that, the, work, of, adam, smith, was, far, more, immediately, relevant, today, than, he, was, at, the, centennial, of, the, wealth, of, nations, in, 1876, other, writers, have, argued, that, smith, s, support, for, laissez, faire, which, in, french, means, leave, alone, has, been, overstated, herbert, stein, wrote, that, the, people, who, wear, an, adam, smith, necktie, do, it, to, make, a, statement, of, their, devotion, to, the, idea, of, free, markets, and, limited, government, and, that, this, misrepresents, smith, s, ideas, stein, writes, that, smith, was, not, pure, or, doctrinaire, about, this, idea, he, viewed, government, intervention, in, the, market, with, great, skepticism, yet, he, was, prepared, to, accept, or, propose, qualifications, to, that, policy, in, the, specific, cases, where, he, judged, that, their, net, effect, would, be, beneficial, and, would, not, undermine, the, basically, free, character, of, the, system, he, did, not, wear, the, adam, smith, necktie, in, stein, s, reading, the, wealth, of, nations, could, justify, the, food, and, drug, administration, the, consumer, product, safety, commission, mandatory, employer, health, benefits, environmentalism, and, discriminatory, taxation, to, deter, improper, or, luxurious, behavior, similarly, vivienne, brown, stated, in, the, economic, journal, that, in, the, 20th, century, united, states, reaganomics, supporters, the, wall, street, journal, and, other, similar, sources, have, spread, among, the, general, public, a, partial, and, misleading, vision, of, smith, portraying, him, as, an, extreme, dogmatic, defender, of, laissez, faire, capitalism, and, supply, side, economics, in, fact, the, wealth, of, nations, includes, the, following, statement, on, the, payment, of, taxes, the, subjects, of, every, state, ought, to, contribute, towards, the, support, of, the, government, as, nearly, as, possible, in, proportion, to, their, respective, abilities, that, is, in, proportion, to, the, revenue, which, they, respectively, enjoy, under, the, protection, of, the, state, some, commentators, have, argued, that, smith, s, works, show, support, for, a, progressive, not, flat, income, tax, and, that, he, specifically, named, taxes, that, he, thought, should, be, required, by, the, state, among, them, luxury, goods, taxes, and, tax, on, rent, yet, smith, argued, for, the, impossibility, of, taxing, the, people, in, proportion, to, their, economic, revenue, by, any, capitation, smith, argued, that, taxes, should, principally, go, toward, protecting, justice, and, certain, publick, institutions, that, were, necessary, for, the, benefit, of, all, of, society, but, that, could, not, be, provided, by, private, enterprise, additionally, smith, outlined, the, proper, expenses, of, the, government, in, the, wealth, of, nations, book, v, ch, i, included, in, his, requirements, of, a, government, is, to, enforce, contracts, and, provide, justice, system, grant, patents, and, copy, rights, provide, public, goods, such, as, infrastructure, provide, national, defence, and, regulate, banking, the, role, of, the, government, was, to, provide, goods, of, such, a, nature, that, the, profit, could, never, repay, the, expense, to, any, individual, such, as, roads, bridges, canals, and, harbours, he, also, encouraged, invention, and, new, ideas, through, his, patent, enforcement, and, support, of, infant, industry, monopolies, he, supported, partial, public, subsidies, for, elementary, education, and, he, believed, that, competition, among, religious, institutions, would, provide, general, benefit, to, the, society, in, such, cases, however, smith, argued, for, local, rather, than, centralised, control, even, those, publick, works, which, are, of, such, a, nature, that, they, cannot, afford, any, revenue, for, maintaining, themselves, are, always, better, maintained, by, a, local, or, provincial, revenue, under, the, management, of, a, local, and, provincial, administration, than, by, the, general, revenue, of, the, state, wealth, of, nations, v, i, d, 18, finally, he, outlined, how, the, government, should, support, the, dignity, of, the, monarch, or, chief, magistrate, such, that, they, are, equal, or, above, the, public, in, fashion, he, even, states, that, monarchs, should, be, provided, for, in, a, greater, fashion, than, magistrates, of, a, republic, because, we, naturally, expect, more, splendor, in, the, court, of, a, king, than, in, the, mansion, house, of, a, doge, in, addition, he, allowed, that, in, some, specific, circumstances, retaliatory, tariffs, may, be, beneficial, the, recovery, of, a, great, foreign, market, will, generally, more, than, compensate, the, transitory, inconvenience, of, paying, dearer, during, a, short, time, for, some, sorts, of, goods, however, he, added, that, in, general, a, retaliatory, tariff, seems, a, bad, method, of, compensating, the, injury, done, to, certain, classes, of, our, people, to, do, another, injury, ourselves, not, only, to, those, classes, but, to, almost, all, the, other, classes, of, them, economic, historians, such, as, jacob, viner, regard, smith, as, a, strong, advocate, of, free, markets, and, limited, government, what, smith, called, natural, liberty, but, not, as, a, dogmatic, supporter, of, laissez, faire, economist, daniel, klein, believes, using, the, term, free, market, economics, or, free, market, economist, to, identify, the, ideas, of, smith, is, too, general, and, slightly, misleading, klein, offers, six, characteristics, central, to, the, identity, of, smith, s, economic, thought, and, argues, that, a, new, name, is, needed, to, give, a, more, accurate, depiction, of, the, smithian, identity, economist, david, ricardo, set, straight, some, of, the, misunderstandings, about, smith, s, thoughts, on, free, market, many, continue, to, fall, victim, to, the, thinking, that, smith, was, a, free, market, economist, without, exception, though, he, was, not, ricardo, pointed, out, that, smith, was, in, support, of, helping, infant, industries, smith, believed, that, the, government, should, subsidise, newly, formed, industry, but, he, did, fear, that, when, the, infant, industry, grew, into, adulthood, it, would, be, unwilling, to, surrender, the, government, help, smith, also, supported, tariffs, on, imported, goods, to, counteract, an, internal, tax, on, the, same, good, smith, also, fell, to, pressure, in, supporting, some, tariffs, in, support, for, national, defence, some, have, also, claimed, emma, rothschild, among, them, that, smith, would, have, supported, a, minimum, wage, although, no, direct, textual, evidence, supports, the, claim, indeed, smith, wrote, the, price, of, labour, it, must, be, observed, cannot, be, ascertained, very, accurately, anywhere, different, prices, being, often, paid, at, the, same, place, and, for, the, same, sort, of, labour, not, only, according, to, the, different, abilities, of, the, workmen, but, according, to, the, easiness, or, hardness, of, the, masters, where, wages, are, not, regulated, by, law, all, that, we, can, pretend, to, determine, is, what, are, the, most, usual, and, experience, seems, to, show, that, law, can, never, regulate, them, properly, though, it, has, often, pretended, to, do, so, the, wealth, of, nations, book, 1, chapter, 8, however, smith, also, noted, to, the, contrary, the, existence, of, an, imbalanced, inequality, of, bargaining, power, a, landlord, a, farmer, a, master, manufacturer, a, merchant, though, they, did, not, employ, a, single, workman, could, generally, live, a, year, or, two, upon, the, stocks, which, they, have, already, acquired, many, workmen, could, not, subsist, a, week, few, could, subsist, a, month, and, scarce, any, a, year, without, employment, in, the, long, run, the, workman, may, be, as, necessary, to, his, master, as, his, master, is, to, him, but, the, necessity, is, not, so, immediate
