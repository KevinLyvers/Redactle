recording, session, which, was, produced, by, owen, bradley, he, attended, two, more, sessions, in, nashville, but, with, the, producer, selecting, the, session, musicians, and, arrangements, holly, became, increasingly, frustrated, by, his, lack, of, creative, control, in, april, 1956, decca, released, blue, days, black, nights, as, a, single, with, love, me, on, the, b, side, denny, included, holly, on, a, tour, as, the, opening, act, for, faron, young, during, the, tour, they, were, promoted, as, buddy, holly, and, the, two, tones, while, later, decca, called, them, buddy, holly, and, the, three, tunes, the, label, later, released, holly, s, second, single, modern, don, juan, backed, with, you, are, my, one, desire, neither, single, made, an, impression, on, january, 22, 1957, decca, informed, holly, his, contract, would, not, be, renewed, but, insisted, he, could, not, record, the, same, songs, for, anyone, else, for, five, years, holly, was, unhappy, with, the, results, of, his, time, with, decca, and, inspired, by, the, success, of, buddy, knox, s, party, doll, and, jimmy, bowen, s, i, m, stickin, with, you, he, visited, norman, petty, who, had, produced, and, promoted, both, records, together, with, allison, bassist, larry, welborn, and, rhythm, guitarist, niki, sullivan, he, went, to, petty, s, studio, in, clovis, new, mexico, the, group, recorded, a, demo, of, that, ll, be, the, day, a, song, they, had, previously, recorded, in, nashville, in, june, 1956, holly, along, with, his, older, brother, larry, as, well, as, allison, and, sonny, curtis, had, gone, to, see, the, film, the, searchers, starring, john, wayne, in, which, wayne, repeatedly, used, the, phrase, that, ll, be, the, day, this, line, of, dialogue, inspired, the, young, musicians, now, playing, lead, guitar, holly, achieved, the, sound, he, desired, petty, became, his, manager, and, sent, the, record, to, brunswick, records, in, new, york, city, holly, still, under, contract, with, decca, could, not, release, the, record, under, his, name, so, a, band, name, was, used, allison, proposed, the, name, crickets, brunswick, gave, holly, a, basic, agreement, to, release, that, ll, be, the, day, leaving, him, with, both, artistic, control, and, financial, responsibility, for, future, recordings, impressed, with, the, demo, the, label, s, executives, released, it, without, recording, a, new, version, i, m, looking, for, someone, to, love, was, the, b, side, the, single, was, credited, to, the, crickets, petty, and, holly, later, learned, that, brunswick, was, a, subsidiary, of, decca, which, legally, cleared, future, recordings, under, the, name, buddy, holly, recordings, credited, to, the, crickets, would, be, released, on, brunswick, while, the, recordings, under, holly, s, name, were, released, on, another, subsidiary, label, coral, records, holly, concurrently, held, a, recording, contract, with, both, labels, norman, petty, reasoned, correctly, that, disc, jockeys, would, be, reluctant, to, play, and, promote, multiple, new, records, by, the, same, artist, but, would, have, no, problem, playing, these, same, records, if, they, were, credited, to, different, performers, holly, himself, was, unaware, of, this, strategy, in, a, 1957, radio, interview, with, dale, lowery, holly, said, we, have, three, records, going, out, right, now, of, course, the, first, one, was, that, ll, be, the, day, the, first, one, released, then, we, have, a, new, one, out, by, the, crickets, called, oh, boy, and, not, fade, away, and, then, there, s, one, out, it, s, the, same, group, but, it, s, under, my, name, i, don, t, know, why, they, did, it, that, way, but, it, went, out, under, my, name, called, peggy, sue, and, everyday, holly, s, records, were, released, with, labels, reading, buddy, holly, or, the, crickets, the, band, was, never, credited, on, records, as, buddy, holly, and, the, crickets, until, 1962, when, a,
