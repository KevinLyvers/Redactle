commemorated, his, death, sri, aurobindo, s, close, spiritual, collaborator, mirra, alfassa, born, alfassa, came, to, be, known, as, the, mother, she, was, a, french, national, born, in, paris, on,

in, 1920, sri, aurobindo, considered, her, his, spiritual, equal, and, collaborator, after, 24, november, 1926, when, sri, aurobindo, retired, into, seclusion, he, left, it, to, her, to, plan, build, and, run, the, ashram, the, community, of, disciples, which, had, gathered, around, them, sometime, later, when, families, with, children, joined, the, ashram, she, established, and, supervised, the, sri, aurobindo, international, centre, of, education, with, its, experiments, in, the, field, of, education, when, he, died, in, 1950, she, continued, their, spiritual, work, directed, the, ashram, and, guided, their, disciples, sri, aurobindo, s, concept, of, the, integral, yoga, system, is, described, in, his, books, the, synthesis, of, yoga, and, the, life, divine, the, life, divine, is, a, compilation, of, essays, published, serially, in, arya, sri, aurobindo, argues, that, divine, brahman, manifests, as, empirical, reality, through, l, l, or, divine, play, instead, of, positing, that, the, world, we, experience, is, an, illusion, m, y, aurobindo, argues, that, world, can, evolve, and, become, a, new, world, with, new, species, far, above, the, human, species, just, as, human, species, have, evolved, after, the, animal, species, as, such, he, argued, that, the, end, goal, of, spiritual, practice, could, not, merely, be, a, liberation, from, the, world, into, samadhi, but, would, also, be, that, of, descent, of, the, divine, into, the, world, in, order, to, transform, it, into, a, divine, existence, thus, this, constituted, the, purpose, of, integral, yoga, regarding, the, involution, of, consciousness, in, matter, he, wrote, that, this, descent, this, sacrifice, of, the, purusha, the, divine, soul, submitting, itself, to, force, and, matter, so, that, it, may, inform, and, illuminate, them, is, the, seed, of, redemption, of, this, world, of, inconscience, and, ignorance, sri, aurobindo, believed, that, darwinism, merely, describes, a, phenomenon, of, the, evolution, of, matter, into, life, but, does, not, explain, the, reason, behind, it, while, he, finds, life, to, be, already, present, in, matter, because, all, of, existence, is, a, manifestation, of, brahman, he, argues, that, nature, which, he, interpreted, as, divine, has, evolved, life, out, of, matter, and, the, mind, out, of, life, all, of, existence, he, argues, is, attempting, to, manifest, to, the, level, of, the, supermind, that, evolution, had, a, purpose, he, stated, that, he, found, the, task, of, understanding, the, nature, of, reality, arduous, and, difficult, to, justify, by, immediate, tangible, results, at, the, centre, of, sri, aurobindo, s, metaphysical, system, is, the, supermind, an, intermediary, power, between, the, unmanifested, brahman, and, the, manifested, world, sri, aurobindo, claims, that, the, supermind, is, not, completely, alien, to, us, and, can, be, realized, within, ourselves, as, it, is, always, present, within, mind, since, the, latter, is, in, reality, identical, with, the, former, and, contains, it, as, a, potentiality, within, itself, sri, aurobindo, does, not, portray, supermind, as, an, original, invention, of, his, own, but, believes, it, can, be, found, in, the, vedas, and, that, the, vedic, gods, represent, powers, of, the, supermind, in, the, integral, yoga, he, declares, that, by, the, supermind, is, meant, the, full, truth, consciousness, of, the, divine, nature, in, which, there, can, be, no, place, for, the, principle, of, division, and, ignorance, it, is, always, a, full, light, and, knowledge, superior, to, all, mental, substance, or, mental, movement, supermind, is, a, bridge, between, sachchidananda, and, the, lower, manifestation, and, it, is, only, through, the, supramental, that, mind, life, and, body, can, be, spiritually, transformed, as, opposed, to, through, sachchidananda, the, descent, of, supermind, will, mean, the, creation, of, a, supramental, race, in, his, writings, talks, and, letters, sri, aurobindo, has, referred, to, several, european, philosophers, with, whose, basic, concepts, he, was, familiar, commenting, on, their, ideas, and, discussing, the, question, of, affinity, to, his, own, line, of, thought, thus, he, wrote, a, long, essay, on, the, greek, philosopher, heraclitus, and, mentioned, especially, plato, plotinus, nietzsche, and, bergson, as, thinkers, in, whom, he, was, interested, because, of, their, more, intuitive, approach, on, the, other, hand, he, felt, little, attraction, for, the, philosophy, of, kant, or, hegel, several, studies, have, shown, a, remarkable, closeness, to, the, evolutionary, thought, of, teilhard, de, chardin, whom, he, did, not, know, whereas, the, latter, came, to, know, of, sri, aurobindo, at, a, late, stage, after, reading, some, chapters, of, the, life, divine, he, is, reported, to, have, said, that, sri, aurobindo, s, vision, of, evolution, was, basically, the, same, as, his, own, though, stated, for, asian, readers, several, scholars, have, discovered, significant, similarities, in, the, thought, of, sri, aurobindo, and, hegel, steve, odin, has, discussed, this, subject, comprehensively, in, a, comparative, study, odin, writes, that, sri, aurobindo, has, appropriated, hegel, s, notion, of, an, absolute, spirit, and, employed, it, to, radically, restructure, the, architectonic, framework, of, the, ancient, hindu, vedanta, system, in, contemporary, terms, in, his, analysis, odin, arrives, at, the, conclusion, that, both, philosophers, similarly, envision, world, creation, as, the, progressive, self, manifestation, and, evolutionary, ascent, of, a, universal, consciousness, in, its, journey, toward, self, realization, he, points, out, that, in, contrast, to, the, deterministic, and, continuous, dialectal, unfolding, of, absolute, reason, by, the, mechanism, of, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or, affirmation, negation, integration, sri, aurobindo, argues, for, a, creative, emergent, mode, of, evolution, in, his, r, sum, odin, states, that, sri, aurobindo, has, overcome, the, ahistorical, world, vision, of, traditional, hinduism, and, presented, a, concept, which, allows, for, a, genuine, advance, and, novelty, although, sri, aurobindo, was, familiar, with, the, most, important, lines, of, thought, in, western, philosophy, he, did, not, acknowledge, their, influence, on, his, own, writings, he, wrote, that, his, philosophy, was, formed, first, by, the, study, of, the, upanishads, and, the, gita, they, were, the, basis, of, my, first, practice, of, yoga, with, the, help, of, his, readings, he, tried, to, move, on, to, actual, experience, and, it, was, on, this, experience, that, later, on, i, founded, my, philosophy, not, on, ideas, themselves, he, assumes, that, the, seers, of, the, upanishads, had, basically, the, same, approach, and, gives, some, details, of, his, vision, of, the, past, in, a, long, passage, in, the, renaissance, of, india, the, upanishads, have, been, the, acknowledged, source, of, numerous, profound, philosophies, and, religions, he, writes, even, buddhism, with, all, its, developments, was, only, a, restatement, from, a, new, standpoint, and, with, fresh, terms, and, furthermore, the, ideas, of, the, upanishads, can, be, rediscovered, in, much, of, the, thought, of, pythagoras, and, plato, and, form, the, profound, part, of, neo, platonism, and, gnosticism, finally, the, larger, part, of, german, metaphysics, is, little, more, in, substance, than, an, intellectual, development, of, great, realities, more, spiritually, seen, in, this, ancient, teaching, when, once, he, was, asked, by, a, disciple, whether, plato, got, some, of, his, ideas, from, indian, books, he, responded, that, though, something, of, the, philosophy, of, india, got, through, by, means, of, pythagoras, and, others, he, assumed, that, plato, got, most, of, his, ideas, from, intuition, sri, aurobindo, s, indebtedness, to, the, indian, tradition, also, becomes, obvious, through, his, placing, a, large, number, of, quotations, from, the, rig, veda, the, upanishads, and, the, bhagavadgita, at, the, beginning, of, the, chapters, in, the, life, divine, showing, the, connection, of, his, own, thought, to, veda, and, vedanta, the, isha, upanishad, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, more, accessible, writings, of, sri, aurobindo, before, he, published, his, final, translation, and, analysis, he, wrote, ten, incomplete, commentaries, in, a, key, passage, he, points, out, that, the, brahman, or, absolute, is, both, the, stable, and, the, moving, we, must, see, it, in, eternal, and, immutable, spirit, and, in, all, the, changing, manifestations, of, universe, and, relativity, sri, aurobindo, s, biographer, k, r, s, iyengar, quotes, r, s, mugali, as, stating, that, sri, aurobindo, might, have, obtained, in, this, upanishad, the, thought, seed, which, later, grew, into, the, life, divine, sisir, kumar, maitra, who, was, a, leading, exponent, of, sri, aurobindo, s, philosophy, has, referred, to, the, issue, of, external, influences, and, written, that, sri, aurobindo, does, not, mention, names, but, as, one, reads, his, books, one, cannot, fail, to, notice, how, thorough, is, his, grasp, of, the, great, western, philosophers, of, the, present, age, although, he, is, indian, one, should, not, underrate, the, influence, of, western, thought, upon, him, this, influence, is, there, very, clearly, visible, but, sri, aurobindo, has, not, allowed, himself, to, be, dominated, by, it, he, has, made, full, use, of, western, thought, but, he, has, made, use, of, it, for, the, purpose, of, building, up, his, own, system, thus, maitra, like, steve, odin, sees, sri, aurobindo, not, only, in, the, tradition, and, context, of, indian, but, also, western, philosophy, and, assumes, he, may, have, adopted, some, elements, from, the, latter, for, his, synthesis, r, puligandla, supports, this, viewpoint, in, his, book, fundamentals, of, indian, philosophy, he, describes, sri, aurobindo, s, philosophy, as, an, original, synthesis, of, the, indian, and, western, traditions, he, integrates, in, a, unique, fashion, the, great, social, political, and, scientific, achievements, of, the, modern, west, with, the, ancient, and, profound, spiritual, insights, of, hinduism, the, vision, that, powers, the, life, divine, of, aurobindo, is, none, other, than, the, upanishadic, vision, of, the, unity, of, all, existence, puligandla, also, discusses, sri, aurobindo, s, critical, position, vis, vis, shankara, and, his, thesis, that, the, latter, s, vedanta, is, a, world, negating, philosophy, as, it, teaches, that, the, world, is, unreal, and, illusory, from, puligandla, s, standpoint, this, is, a, misrepresentation, of, shankara, s, position, which, may, have, been, caused, by, sri, aurobindo, s, endeavour, to, synthesize, hindu, and, western, modes, of, thought, identifying, shankara, s, mayavada, with, the, subjective, idealism, of, george, berkeley, however, sri, aurobindo, s, critique, of, shankara, is, supported, by, u, c, dubey, in, his, paper, titled, integralism, the, distinctive, feature, of, sri, aurobindo, s, philosophy, he, points, out, that, sri, aurobindo, s, system, presents, an, integral, view, of, reality, where, there, is, no, opposition, between, the, absolute, and, its, creative, force, as, they, are, actually, one, furthermore, he, refers, to, sri, aurobindo, s, conception, of, the, supermind, as, the, mediatory, principle, between, the, absolute, and, the, finite, world, and, quotes, s, k, maitra, stating, that, this, conception, is, the, pivot, round, which, the, whole, of, sri, aurobindo, s, philosophy, moves, dubey, proceeds, to, analyse, the, approach, of, the, shankarites, and, believes, that, they, follow, an, inadequate, kind, of, logic, that, does, not, do, justice, to, the, challenge, of, tackling, the, problem, of, the, absolute, which, cannot, be, known, by, finite, reason, with, the, help, of, the, finite, reason, he, says, we, are, bound, to, determine, the, nature, of, reality, as, one, or, many, being, or, becoming, but, sri, aurobindo, s, integral, advaitism, reconciles, all, apparently, different, aspects, of, existence, in, an, all, embracing, unity, of, the, absolute, next, dubey, explains, that, for, sri, aurobindo, there, is, a, higher, reason, the, logic, of, the, infinite, in, which, his, integralism, is, rooted, sri, aurobindo, was, an, indian, nationalist, but, is, best, known, for, his, philosophy, on, human, evolution, and, integral, yoga, his, influence, has, been, wide, ranging, in, india, s, k, maitra, anilbaran, roy, and, d, p, chattopadhyaya, commented, on, sri, aurobindo, s, work, writers, on, esotericism, and, traditional, wisdom, such, as, mircea, eliade, paul, brunton, and, rene, guenon, all, saw, him, as, an, authentic, representative, of, the, indian, spiritual, tradition, though, rene, guenon, thought, sri, aurobindo, s, thoughts, were, betrayed, by, some, of, his, followers, and, that, some, works, published, under, his, name, were, not, authentic, since, not, traditional, haridas, chaudhuri, and, frederic, spiegelberg, were, among, those, who, were, inspired, by, aurobindo, who, worked, on, the, newly, formed, american, academy, of, asian, studies, in, san, francisco, soon, after, chaudhuri, and, his, wife, bina, established, the, cultural, integration, fellowship, from, which, later, emerged, the,

was, heavily, inspired, by, satprem, s, writings, about, sri, aurobindo, during, a, week, in, may, 1968, a, time, at, which, the, composer, was, undergoing, a, personal, crisis, and, had, found, sri, aurobindo, s, philosophies, were, relevant, to, his, feelings, after, this, experience, stockhausen, s, music, took, a, completely, different, turn, focusing, on, mysticism, that, was, to, continue, until, the, end, of, his, career, jean, gebser, acknowledged, sri, aurobindo, s, influence, on, his, work, and, referred, to, him, several, times, in, his, writings, thus, in, the, invisible, origin, he, quotes, a, long, passage, from, the, synthesis, of, yoga, gebser, believes, that, he, was, in, some, way, brought, into, the, extremely, powerful, spiritual, field, of, force, radiating, through,
