tended, to, revise, james, s, reputation, and, treat, him, as, a, serious, and, thoughtful, monarch, he, was, strongly, committed, to, a, peace, policy, and, tried, to, avoid, involvement, in, religious, wars, especially, the, thirty, years, war, that, devastated, much, of, central, europe, he, tried, but, failed, to, prevent, the, rise, of, hawkish, elements, in, the, english, parliament,

also, instilled, in, him, a, lifelong, passion, for, literature, and, learning, buchanan, sought, to, turn, james, into, a, god, fearing, protestant, king, who, accepted, the, limitations, of,

wrote, james, melville, followed, a, banquet, at, dalkeith, palace, given, by, james, douglas, earl, of, morton, morton, was, elected, to, mar, s, office, and, proved, in, many, ways, the, most, effective, of, james, s, regents, but, he, made, enemies, by, his, rapacity, he, fell, from, favour, when, frenchman, esm, stewart, sieur, d, aubigny, first, cousin, of, james, s, father, lord, darnley, and, future, earl, of, lennox, arrived, in, scotland, and, quickly, established, himself, as, the, first, of, james, s, powerful, favourites, james, was, proclaimed, an, adult, ruler, in, a, ceremony, of, entry, to, edinburgh, on, 19, october, 1579, morton, was, executed, on, 2, june, 1581, belatedly, charged, with, complicity, in, darnley, s, murder, on, 8, august, james, made, lennox, the, only, duke, in, scotland, the, king, then, fifteen, years, old, remained, under, the, influence, of, lennox, for, about, one, more, year, lennox, was, a, protestant, convert, but, he, was, distrusted, by, scottish, calvinists, who, noticed, the, physical, displays, of, affection, between, him, and, the, king, and, alleged, that, lennox, went, about, to, draw, the, king, to, carnal, lust, in, august, 1582, in, what, became, known, as, the, ruthven, raid, the, protestant, earls, william, ruthven, earl, of, gowrie, and, archibald, douglas, earl, of, angus, lured, james, into, ruthven, castle, imprisoned, him, and, forced, lennox, to, leave, scotland, on, 19, september, 1582, during, james, s, imprisonment, john, craig, whom, the, king, had, personally, appointed, royal, chaplain, in, 1579, rebuked, him, so, sharply, from, the, pulpit, for, having, issued, a, proclamation, so, offensive, to, the, clergy, that, the, king, wept, after, james, escaped, from, falkland, on, 27, june, 1583, he, assumed, increasing, control, of, his, kingdom, he, pushed, through, the, black, acts, to, assert, royal, authority, over, the, kirk, and, denounced, the, writings, of, his, former, tutor, buchanan, between, 1584, and, 1603, he, established, effective, royal, government, and, relative, peace, among, the, lords, ably, assisted, by, john, maitland, of, thirlestane, who, led, the, government, until, 1592, an, eight, man, commission, known, as, the, octavians, brought, some, control, over, the, ruinous, state, of, james, s, finances, in, 1596, but, it, drew, opposition, from, vested, interests, it, was, disbanded, within, a, year, after, a, riot, in, edinburgh, which, was, stoked, by, anti, catholicism, and, led, the, court, to, withdraw, to, linlithgow, temporarily, one, last, scottish, attempt, against, the, king, s, person, occurred, in, august, 1600, when, james, was, apparently, assaulted, by, alexander, ruthven, the, younger, brother, of, john, ruthven, earl, of, gowrie, at, gowrie, house, the, seat, of, the, ruthvens, ruthven, was, run, through, by, james, s, page, john, ramsay, and, the, earl, of, gowrie, was, killed, in, the, ensuing, fracas, there, were, few, surviving, witnesses, given, james, s, history, with, the, ruthvens, and, the, fact, that, he, owed, them, a, great, deal, of, money, his, account, of, the, circumstances, was, not, universally, believed, in, 1586, james, signed, the, treaty, of, berwick, with, england, that, and, his, mother, s, execution, in, 1587, which, he, denounced, as, a, preposterous, and, strange, procedure, helped, clear, the, way, for, his, succession, south, of, the, border, queen, elizabeth, was, unmarried, and, childless, and, james, was, her, most, likely, successor, securing, the, english, succession, became, a, cornerstone, of, his, policy, during, the, spanish, armada, crisis, of, 1588, he, assured, elizabeth, of, his, support, as, your, natural, son, and, compatriot, of, your, country, elizabeth, sent, james, an, annual, subsidy, from, 1586, which, gave, her, some, leverage, over, affairs, in, scotland, throughout, his, youth, james, was, praised, for, his, chastity, since, he, showed, little, interest, in, women, after, the, loss, of, lennox, he, continued, to, prefer, male, company, a, suitable, marriage, however, was, necessary, to, reinforce, his, rule, and, the, choice, fell, on, fourteen, year, old, anne, of, denmark, younger, daughter, of, the, protestant, danish, king, frederick, ii, shortly, after, a, proxy, marriage, in, copenhagen, in, august, 1589, anne, sailed, for, scotland, but, was, forced, by, storms, to, the, coast, of, norway, on, hearing, that, the, crossing, had, been, abandoned, james, sailed, from, leith, with, a, 300, strong, retinue, to, fetch, anne, personally, in, what, historian, david, harris, willson, called, the, one, romantic, episode, of, his, life, the, couple, were, married, formally, at, the, bishop, s, palace, in, oslo, on, 23, november, james, received, a, dowry, of, 75, 000, danish, dalers, and, a, gift, of, 10, 000, dalers, from, his, mother, in, law, sophie, of, mecklenburg, g, strow, after, stays, at, elsinore, and, copenhagen, and, a, meeting, with, tycho, brahe, james, and, anne, returned, to, scotland, on, 1, may, 1590, by, all, accounts, james, was, at, first, infatuated, with, anne, and, in, the, early, years, of, their, marriage, seems, always, to, have, shown, her, patience, and, affection, the, royal, couple, produced, three, children, who, survived, to, adulthood, henry, frederick, prince, of, wales, who, died, of, typhoid, fever, in, 1612, aged, 18, elizabeth, later, queen, of, bohemia, and, charles, james, s, successor, anne, suffered, from, recurrent, bouts, of, sickness, and, was, seriously, ill, from, 1617, james, visited, anne, only, three, times, during, her, last, illness, she, died, before, her, husband, in, march, 1619, james, s, visit, to, denmark, a, country, familiar, with, witch, hunts, sparked, an, interest, in, the, study, of, witchcraft, which, he, considered, a, branch, of, theology, he, attended, the, north, berwick, witch, trials, the, first, major, persecution, of, witches, in, scotland, under, the, witchcraft, act, 1563, several, people, were, convicted, of, using, witchcraft, to, send, storms, against, james, s, ship, most, notably, agnes, sampson, james, became, concerned, with, the, threat, posed, by, witches, and, wrote, daemonologie, in, 1597, a, tract, inspired, by, his, personal, involvement, that, opposed, the, practice, of, witchcraft, and, that, provided, background, material, for, shakespeare, s, macbeth, james, personally, supervised, the, torture, of, women, accused, of, being, witches, after, 1599, his, views, became, more, sceptical, in, a, later, letter, written, in, england, to, his, son, henry, james, congratulates, the, prince, on, the, discovery, of, yon, little, counterfeit, wench, i, pray, god, ye, may, be, my, heir, in, such, discoveries, most, miracles, now, a, days, prove, but, illusions, and, ye, may, see, by, this, how, wary, judges, should, be, in, trusting, accusations, the, forcible, dissolution, of, the, lordship, of, the, isles, by, james, iv, of, scotland, in, 1493, had, led, to, troubled, times, for, the, western, seaboard, james, iv, had, subdued, the, organised, military, might, of, the, hebrides, but, he, and, his, immediate, successors, lacked, the, will, or, ability, to, provide, an, alternative, form, of, governance, as, a, result, the, 16th, century, became, known, as, linn, nan, creach, the, time, of, raids, furthermore, the, effects, of, the, reformation, were, slow, to, affect, the, g, idhealtachd, driving, a, religious, wedge, between, this, area, and, centres, of, political, control, in, the, central, belt, in, 1540, james, v, had, toured, the, hebrides, forcing, the, clan, chiefs, to, accompany, him, there, followed, a, period, of, peace, but, the, clans, were, soon, at, loggerheads, with, one, another, again, during, james, vi, s, reign, the, citizens, of, the, hebrides, were, portrayed, as, lawless, barbarians, rather, than, being, the, cradle, of, scottish, christianity, and, nationhood, official, documents, describe, the, peoples, of, the, highlands, as, void, of, the, knawledge, and, feir, of, god, who, were, prone, to, all, kynd, of, barbarous, and, bestile, cruelteis, the, gaelic, language, spoken, fluently, by, james, iv, and, probably, by, james, v, became, known, in, the, time, of, james, vi, as, erse, or, irish, implying, that, it, was, foreign, in, nature, parliament, decided, that, gaelic, had, become, a, principal, cause, of, the, highlanders, shortcomings, and, sought, to, abolish, it, it, was, against, this, background, that, james, vi, authorised, the, gentleman, adventurers, of, fife, to, civilise, the, most, barbarous, isle, of, lewis, in, 1598, james, wrote, that, the, colonists, were, to, act, not, by, agreement, with, the, local, inhabitants, but, by, extirpation, of, thame, their, landing, at, stornoway, began, well, but, the, colonists, were, driven, out, by, local, forces, commanded, by, murdoch, and, neil, macleod, the, colonists, tried, again, in, 1605, with, the, same, result, although, a, third, attempt, in, 1607, was, more, successful, the, statutes, of, iona, were, enacted, in, 1609, which, required, clan, chiefs, to, provide, support, for, protestant, ministers, to, highland, parishes, to, outlaw, bards, to, report, regularly, to, edinburgh, to, answer, for, their, actions, and, to, send, their, heirs, to, lowland, scotland, to, be, educated, in, english, speaking, protestant, schools, so, began, a, process, specifically, aimed, at, the, extirpation, of, the, gaelic, language, the, destruction, of, its, traditional, culture, and, the, suppression, of, its, bearers, in, the, northern, isles, james, s, cousin, patrick, stewart, earl, of, orkney, resisted, the, statutes, of, iona, and, was, consequently, imprisoned, his, natural, son, robert, led, an, unsuccessful, rebellion, against, james, and, the, earl, and, his, son, were, hanged, their, estates, were, forfeited, and, the, orkney, and, shetland, islands, were, annexed, to, the, crown, in, 1597, 98, james, wrote, the, true, law, of, free, monarchies, and, basilikon, doron, royal, gift, in, which, he, argues, a, theological, basis, for, monarchy, in, the, true, law, he, sets, out, the, divine, right, of, kings, explaining, that, kings, are, higher, beings, than, other, men, for, biblical, reasons, though, the, highest, bench, is, the, sliddriest, to, sit, upon, the, document, proposes, an, absolutist, theory, of, monarchy, by, which, a, king, may, impose, new, laws, by, royal, prerogative, but, must, also, pay, heed, to, tradition, and, to, god, who, would, stirre, up, such, scourges, as, pleaseth, him, for, punishment, of, wicked, kings, basilikon, doron, was, written, as, a, book, of, instruction, for, the, four, year, old, prince, henry, and, provides, a, more, practical, guide, to, kingship, the, work, is, considered, to, be, well, written, and, perhaps, the, best, example, of, james, s, prose, james, s, advice, concerning, parliaments, which, he, understood, as, merely, the, king, s, head, court, foreshadows, his, difficulties, with, the, english, house, of, commons, hold, no, parliaments, he, tells, henry, but, for, the, necesitie, of, new, lawes, which, would, be, but, seldome, in, the, true, law, james, maintains, that, the, king, owns, his, realm, as, a, feudal, lord, owns, his, fief, because, kings, arose, before, any, estates, or, ranks, of, men, before, any, parliaments, were, holden, or, laws, made, and, by, them, was, the, land, distributed, which, at, first, was, wholly, theirs, and, so, it, follows, of, necessity, that, kings, were, the, authors, and, makers, of, the, laws, and, not, the, laws, of, the, kings, in, the, 1580s, and, 1590s, james, promoted, the, literature, of, his, native, country, he, published, his, treatise, some, rules, and, cautions, to, be, observed, and, eschewed, in, scottish, prosody, in, 1584, at, the, age, of, 18, it, was, both, a, poetic, manual, and, a, description, of, the, poetic, tradition, in, his, mother, tongue, of, scots, applying, renaissance, principles, he, also, made, statutory, provision, to, reform, and, promote, the, teaching, of, music, seeing, the, two, in, connection, one, act, of, his, reign, urges, the, scottish, burghs, to, reform, and, support, the, teaching, of, music, in, sang, sculis, in, furtherance, of, these, aims, james, was, both, patron, and, head, of, a, loose, circle, of, scottish, jacobean, court, poets, and, musicians, known, as, the, castalian, band, which, included, william, fowler, and, alexander, montgomerie, among, others, montgomerie, being, a, favourite, of, the, king, james, was, himself, a, poet, and, was, happy, to, be, seen, as, a, practising, member, of, the, group, by, the, late, 1590s, james, s, championing, of, native, scottish, tradition, was, reduced, to, some, extent, by, the, increasing, likelihood, of, his, succession, to, the, english, throne, william, alexander, and, other, courtier, poets, started, to, anglicise, their, written, language, and, followed, the, king, to, london, after, 1603, james, s, role, as, active, literary, participant, and, patron, made, him, a, defining, figure, in, many, respects, for, english, renaissance, poetry, and, drama, which, reached, a, pinnacle, of, achievement, in, his, reign, but, his, patronage, of, the, high, style, in, the, scottish, tradition, which, included, his, ancestor, james, i, of, scotland, became, largely, sidelined, from, 1601, in, the, last, years, of, elizabeth, s, life, certain, english, politicians, notably, her, chief, minister, robert, cecil, maintained, a, secret, correspondence, with, james, to, prepare, in, advance, for, a, smooth, succession, with, the, queen, clearly, dying, cecil, sent, james, a, draft, proclamation, of, his, accession, to, the, english, throne, in, march, 1603, elizabeth, died, in, the, early, hours, of, 24, march, and, james, was, proclaimed, king, in, london, later, the, same, day, on, 5, april, james, left, edinburgh, for, london, promising, to, return, every, three, years, a, promise, that, he, did, not, keep, and, progressed, slowly, southwards, local, lords, received, him, with, lavish, hospitality, along, the, route, and, james, was, amazed, by, the, wealth, of, his, new, land, and, subjects, claiming, that, he, was, swapping, a, stony, couch, for, a, deep, feather, bed, james, arrived, in, the, capital, on, 7, may, nine, days, after, elizabeth, s, funeral, his, new, subjects, flocked, to, see, him, relieved, that, the, succession, had, triggered, neither, unrest, nor, invasion, on, arrival, at, london, he, was, mobbed, by, a, crowd, of, spectators, james, s, english, coronation, took, place, on, 25, july, at, westminster, abbey, an, outbreak, of, plague, restricted, festivities, the, royal, entry, to, london, with, elaborate, allegories, provided, by, dramatic, poets, such, as, thomas, dekker, and, ben, jonson, was, deferred, to, 15, march, 1604, dekker, wrote, that, the, streets, seemed, to, be, paved, with, men, stalls, instead, of, rich, wares, were, set, out, with, children, open, casements, filled, up, with, women, the, kingdom, to, which, james, succeeded, however, had, its, problems, monopolies, and, taxation, had, engendered, a, widespread, sense, of, grievance, and, the, costs, of, war, in, ireland, had, become, a, heavy, burden, on, the, government, which, had, debts, of, 400, 000, james, survived, two, conspiracies, in, the, first, year, of, his, reign, despite, the, smoothness, of, the, succession, and, the, warmth, of, his, welcome, the, bye, plot, and, main, plot, which, led, to, the, arrest, of, henry, brooke, lord, cobham, and, walter, raleigh, among, others, those, hoping, for, a, change, in, government, from, james, were, disappointed, at, first, when, he, kept, elizabeth, s, privy, councillors, in, office, as, secretly, planned, with, cecil, but, james, soon, added, long, time, supporter, henry, howard, and, his, nephew, thomas, howard, to, the, privy, council, as, well, as, five, scottish, nobles, in, the, early, years, of, james, s, reign, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, government, was, tightly, managed, by, the, shrewd, cecil, later, earl, of, salisbury, ably, assisted, by, the, experienced, thomas, egerton, whom, james, made, baron, ellesmere, and, lord, chancellor, and, by, thomas, sackville, soon, earl, of, dorset, who, continued, as, lord, treasurer, as, a, consequence, james, was, free, to, concentrate, on, bigger, issues, such, as, a, scheme, for, a, closer, union, between, england, and, scotland, and, matters, of, foreign, policy, as, well, as, to, enjoy, his, leisure, pursuits, particularly, hunting, james, was, ambitious, to, build, on, the, personal, union, of, scotland, and, england, to, establish, a, single, country, under, one, monarch, one, parliament, and, one, law, a, plan, that, met, opposition, in, both, realms, hath, he, not, made, us, all, in, one, island, james, told, the, english, parliament, compassed, with, one, sea, and, of, itself, by, nature, indivisible, in, april, 1604, however, the, commons, refused, his, request, to, be, titled, king, of, great, britain, on, legal, grounds, in, october, 1604, he, assumed, the, title, king, of, great, britain, instead, of, king, of, england, and, king, of, scotland, though, francis, bacon, told, him, that, he, could, not, use, the, style, in, any, legal, proceeding, instrument, or, assurance, and, the, title, was, not, used, on, english, statutes, james, forced, the, scottish, parliament, to, use, it, and, it, was, used, on, proclamations, coinage, letters, and, treaties, in, both, realms, james, achieved, more, success, in, foreign, policy, never, having, been, at, war, with, spain, he, devoted, his, efforts, to, bringing, the, long, anglo, spanish, war, to, an, end, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, between, the, two, countries, in, august, 1604, thanks, to, the, skilled, diplomacy, of, the, delegation, in, particular, robert, cecil, and, henry, howard, now, earl, of, northampton, james, celebrated, the, treaty, by, hosting, a, great, banquet, freedom, of, worship, for, catholics, in, england, however, continued, to, be, a, major, objective, of, spanish, policy, causing, constant, dilemmas, for, james, distrusted, abroad, for, repression, of, catholics, while, at, home, being, encouraged, by, the, privy, council, to, show, even, less, tolerance, towards, them, a, dissident, catholic, guy, fawkes, was, discovered, in, the, cellars, of, the, parliament, buildings, on, the, night, of, 4, 5, november, 1605, the, eve, of, the, state, opening, of, the, second, session, of, james, s, first, english, parliament, fawkes, was, guarding, a, pile, of, wood, not, far, from, 36, barrels, of, gunpowder, with, which, he, intended, to, blow, up, parliament, house, the, following, day, and, cause, the, destruction, as, james, put, it, not, only, of, my, person, nor, of, my, wife, and, posterity, also, but, of, the, whole, body, of, the, state, in, general, the, sensational, discovery, of, the, gunpowder, plot, as, it, quickly, became, known, aroused, a, mood, of, national, relief, at, the, delivery, of, the, king, and, his, sons, the, earl, of, salisbury, exploited, this, to, extract, higher, subsidies, from, the, ensuing, parliament, than, any, but, one, granted, to, elizabeth, fawkes, and, others, implicated, in, the, unsuccessful, conspiracy, were, executed, the, co, operation, between, monarch, and, parliament, following, the, gunpowder, plot, was, atypical, instead, it, was, the, previous, session, of, 1604, that, shaped, the, attitudes, of, both, sides, for, the, rest, of, the, reign, though, the, initial, difficulties, owed, more, to, mutual, incomprehension, than, conscious, enmity, on, 7, july, 1604, james, had, angrily, prorogued, parliament, after, failing, to, win, its, support, either, for, full, union, or, financial, subsidies, i, will, not, thank, where, i, feel, no, thanks, due, he, had, remarked, in, his, closing, speech, i, am, not, of, such, a, stock, as, to, praise, fools, you, see, how, many, things, you, did, not, well, i, wish, you, would, make, use, of, your, liberty, with, more, modesty, in, time, to, come, as, james, s, reign, progressed, his, government, faced, growing, financial, pressures, partly, due, to, creeping, inflation, but, also, to, the, profligacy, and, financial, incompetence, of, james, s, court, in, february, 1610, salisbury, proposed, a, scheme, known, as, the, great, contract, whereby, parliament, in, return, for, ten, royal, concessions, would, grant, a, lump, sum, of, 600, 000, to, pay, off, the, king, s, debts, plus, an, annual, grant, of, 200, 000, the, ensuing, prickly, negotiations, became, so, protracted, that, james, eventually, lost, patience, and, dismissed, parliament, on, 31, december, 1610, your, greatest, error, he, told, salisbury, hath, been, that, ye, ever, expected, to, draw, honey, out, of, gall, the, same, pattern, was, repeated, with, the, so, called, addled, parliament, of, 1614, which, james, dissolved, after, a, mere, nine, weeks, when, the, commons, hesitated, to, grant, him, the, money, he, required, james, then, ruled, without, parliament, until, 1621, employing, officials, such, as, the, merchant, lionel, cranfield, who, were, astute, at, raising, and, saving, money, for, the, crown, and, sold, baronetcies, and, other, dignities, many, created, for, the, purpose, as, an, alternative, source, of, income, another, potential, source, of, income, was, the, prospect, of, a, spanish, dowry, from, a, marriage, between, charles, prince, of, wales, and, infanta, maria, anna, of, spain, the, policy, of, the, spanish, match, as, it, was, called, was, also, attractive, to, james, as, a, way, to, maintain, peace, with, spain, and, avoid, the, additional, costs, of, a, war, peace, could, be, maintained, as, effectively, by, keeping, the, negotiations, alive, as, by, consummating, the, match, which, may, explain, why, james, protracted, the, negotiations, for, almost, a, decade, the, policy, was, supported, by, the, howards, and, other, catholic, leaning, ministers, and, diplomats, together, known, as, the, spanish, party, but, deeply, distrusted, in, protestant, england, when, walter, raleigh, was, released, from, imprisonment, in, 1616, he, embarked, on, a, hunt, for, gold, in, south, america, with, strict, instructions, from, james, not, to, engage, the, spanish, raleigh, s, expedition, was, a, disastrous, failure, and, his, son, walter, was, killed, fighting, the, spanish, on, raleigh, s, return, to, england, james, had, him, executed, to, the, indignation, of, the, public, who, opposed, the, appeasement, of, spain, james, s, policy, was, further, jeopardised, by, the, outbreak, of, the, thirty, years, war, especially, after, his, protestant, son, in, law, frederick, v, elector, palatine, was, ousted, from, bohemia, by, the, catholic, emperor, ferdinand, ii, in, 1620, and, spanish, troops, simultaneously, invaded, frederick, s, rhineland, home, territory, matters, came, to, a, head, when, james, finally, called, a, parliament, in, 1621, to, fund, a, military, expedition, in, support, of, his, son, in, law, the, commons, on, the, one, hand, granted, subsidies, inadequate, to, finance, serious, military, operations, in, aid, of, frederick, and, on, the, other, remembering, the, profits, gained, under, elizabeth, by, naval, attacks, on, spanish, gold, shipments, called, for, a, war, directly, against, spain, in, november, 1621, roused, by, edward, coke, they, framed, a, petition, asking, not, only, for, war, with, spain, but, also, for, prince, charles, to, marry, a, protestant, and, for, enforcement, of, the, anti, catholic, laws, james, flatly, told, them, not, to, interfere, in, matters, of, royal, prerogative, or, they, would, risk, punishment, which, provoked, them, into, issuing, a, statement, protesting, their, rights, including, freedom, of, speech, urged, on, by, george, villiers, duke, of, buckingham, and, the, spanish, ambassador, diego, sarmiento, de, acu, a, count, of, gondomar, james, ripped, the, protest, out, of, the, record, book, and, dissolved, parliament, in, early, 1623, prince, charles, now, 22, and, buckingham, decided, to, seize, the, initiative, and, travel, to, spain, incognito, to, win, infanta, maria, anna, directly, but, the, mission, proved, an, ineffectual, mistake, maria, anna, detested, charles, and, the, spanish, confronted, them, with, terms, that, included, the, repeal, of, anti, catholic, legislation, by, parliament, though, a, treaty, was, signed, charles, and, buckingham, returned, to, england, in, october, without, the, infanta, and, immediately, renounced, the, treaty, much, to, the, delight, of, the, british, people, disillusioned, by, the, visit, to, spain, charles, and, buckingham, now, turned, james, s, spanish, policy, upon, its, head, and, called, for, a, french, match, and, a, war, against, the, habsburg, empire, to, raise, the, necessary, finance, they, prevailed, upon, james, to, call, another, parliament, which, met, in, february, 1624, for, once, the, outpouring, of, anti, catholic, sentiment, in, the, commons, was, echoed, in, court, where, control, of, policy, was, shifting, from, james, to, charles, and, buckingham, who, pressured, the, king, to, declare, war, and, engineered, the, impeachment, of, lord, treasurer, lionel, cranfield, by, now, made, earl, of, middlesex, when, he, opposed, the, plan, on, grounds, of, cost, the, outcome, of, the, parliament, of, 1624, was, ambiguous, james, still, refused, to, declare, or, fund, a, war, but, charles, believed, the, commons, had, committed, themselves, to, finance, a, war, against, spain, a, stance, that, was, to, contribute, to, his, problems, with, parliament, in, his, own, reign, after, the, gunpowder, plot, james, sanctioned, harsh, measures, to, control, english, catholics, in, may, 1606, parliament, passed, the, popish, recusants, act, which, could, require, any, subject, to, take, an, oath, of, allegiance, denying, the, pope, s, authority, over, the, king, james, was, conciliatory, towards, catholics, who, took, the, oath, of, allegiance, and, tolerated, crypto, catholicism, even, at, court, henry, howard, for, example, was, a, crypto, catholic, received, back, into, the, catholic, church, in, his, final, months, on, ascending, the, english, throne, james, suspected, that, he, might, need, the, support, of, catholics, in, england, so, he, assured, henry, percy, earl, of, northumberland, a, prominent, sympathiser, of, the, old, religion, that, he, would, not, persecute, any, that, will, be, quiet, and, give, but, an, outward, obedience, to, the, law, in, the, millenary, petition, of, 1603, the, puritan, clergy, demanded, the, abolition, of, confirmation, wedding, rings, and, the, term, priest, among, other, things, and, that, the, wearing, of, cap, and, surplice, become, optional, james, was, strict, in, enforcing, conformity, at, first, inducing, a, sense, of, persecution, amongst, many, puritans, but, ejections, and, suspensions, from, livings, became, rarer, as, the, reign, continued, as, a, result, of, the, hampton, court, conference, of, 1604, some, puritan, demands, were, acceded, to, in, the, 1604, book, of, common, prayer, though, many, remained, displeased, the, conference, also, commissioned, a, new, translation, and, compilation, of, approved, books, of, the, bible, to, resolve, discrepancies, among, different, translations, then, being, used, the, king, james, version, as, it, came, to, be, known, was, completed, in, 1611, and, is, considered, a, masterpiece, of, jacobean, prose, it, is, still, in, widespread, use, in, scotland, james, attempted, to, bring, the, scottish, kirk, so, neir, as, can, be, to, the, english, church, and, to, reestablish, episcopacy, a, policy, that, met, with, strong, opposition, from, presbyterians, james, returned, to, scotland, in, 1617, for, the, only, time, after, his, accession, in, england, in, the, hope, of, implementing, anglican, ritual, james, s, bishops, forced, his, five, articles, of, perth, through, a, general, assembly, the, following, year, but, the, rulings, were, widely, resisted, james, left, the, church, in, scotland, divided, at, his, death, a, source, of, future, problems, for, his, son, throughout, his, life, james, had, close, relationships, with, male, courtiers, which, has, caused, debate, among, historians, about, their, exact, nature, in, scotland, anne, murray, was, known, as, the, king, s, mistress, after, his, accession, in, england, his, peaceful, and, scholarly, attitude, contrasted, strikingly, with, the, bellicose, and, flirtatious, behaviour, of, elizabeth, as, indicated, by, the, contemporary, epigram, rex, fuit, elizabeth, nunc, est, regina, iacobus, elizabeth, was, king, now, james, is, queen, some, of, james, s, biographers, conclude, that, esm, stewart, duke, of, lennox, robert, carr, earl, of, somerset, and, george, villiers, duke, of, buckingham, were, his, lovers, john, oglander, observed, that, he, never, yet, saw, any, fond, husband, make, so, much, or, so, great, dalliance, over, his, beautiful, spouse, as, i, have, seen, king, james, over, his, favourites, especially, the, duke, of, buckingham, whom, the, king, would, recalled, sir, edward, peyton, tumble, and, kiss, as, a, mistress, restoration, of, apethorpe, palace, northamptonshire, undertaken, in, 2004, 08, revealed, a, previously, unknown, passage, linking, the, bedchambers, of, james, and, villiers, some, biographers, of, james, argue, that, the, relationships, were, not, sexual, james, s, basilikon, doron, lists, sodomy, among, crimes, ye, are, bound, in, conscience, never, to, forgive, and, james, s, wife, anne, gave, birth, to, seven, live, children, as, well, as, suffering, two, stillbirths, and, at, least, three, other, miscarriages, contemporary, huguenot, poet, th, ophile, de, viau, observed, that, it, is, well, known, that, the, king, of, england, fucks, the, duke, of, buckingham, buckingham, himself, provides, evidence, that, he, slept, in, the, same, bed, as, the, king, writing, to, james, many, years, later, that, he, had, pondered, whether, you, loved, me, now, better, than, at, the, time, which, i, shall, never, forget, at, farnham, where, the, bed, s, head, could, not, be, found, between, the, master, and, his, dog, buckingham, s, words, may, be, interpreted, as, non, sexual, in, the, context, of, 17th, century, court, life, and, remain, ambiguous, despite, their, fondness, it, is, also, possible, that, james, was, bisexual, when, the, earl, of, salisbury, died, in, 1612, he, was, little, mourned, by, those, who, jostled, to, fill, the, power, vacuum, until, salisbury, s, death, the, elizabethan, administrative, system, over, which, he, had, presided, continued, to, function, with, relative, efficiency, from, this, time, forward, however, james, s, government, entered, a, period, of, decline, and, disrepute, salisbury, s, passing, gave, james, the, notion, of, governing, in, person, as, his, own, chief, minister, of, state, with, his, young, scottish, favourite, robert, carr, carrying, out, many, of, salisbury, s, former, duties, but, james, s, inability, to, attend, closely, to, official, business, exposed, the, government, to, factionalism, the, howard, party, consisting, of, henry, howard, earl, of, northampton, thomas, howard, earl, of, suffolk, suffolk, s, son, in, law, william, knollys, lord, knollys, charles, howard, earl, of, nottingham, and, thomas, lake, soon, took, control, of, much, of, the, government, and, its, patronage, even, the, powerful, carr, fell, into, the, howard, camp, hardly, experienced, for, the, responsibilities, thrust, upon, him, and, often, dependent, on, his, intimate, friend, thomas, overbury, for, assistance, with, government, papers, carr, had, an, adulterous, affair, with, frances, howard, countess, of, essex, daughter, of, the, earl, of, suffolk, james, assisted, frances, by, securing, an, annulment, of, her, marriage, to, free, her, to, marry, carr, now, earl, of, somerset, in, summer, 1615, however, it, emerged, that, overbury, had, been, poisoned, he, had, died, on, 15, september, 1613, in, the, tower, of, london, where, he, had, been, placed, at, the, king, s, request, among, those, convicted, of, the, murder, were, the, earl, and, countess, of, somerset, the, earl, had, been, replaced, as, the, king, s, favourite, in, the, meantime, by, villiers, james, pardoned, the, countess, and, commuted, the, earl, s, sentence, of, death, eventually, pardoning, him, in, 1624, the, implication, of, the, king, in, such, a, scandal, provoked, much, public, and, literary, conjecture, and, irreparably, tarnished, james, s, court, with, an, image, of, corruption, and, depravity, the, subsequent, downfall, of, the, howards, left, villiers, unchallenged, as, the, supreme, figure, in, the, government, by, 1619, in, his, later, years, james, suffered, increasingly, from, arthritis, gout, and, kidney, stones, he, also, lost, his, teeth, and, drank, heavily, the, king, was, often, seriously, ill, during, the, last, year, of, his, life, leaving, him, an, increasingly, peripheral, figure, rarely, able, to, visit, london, while, buckingham, consolidated, his, control, of, charles, to, ensure, his, own, future, one, theory, is, that, james, suffered, from, porphyria, a, disease, of, which, his, descendant, george, iii, exhibited, some, symptoms, james, described, his, urine, to, physician, th, odore, de, mayerne, as, being, the, dark, red, colour, of, alicante, wine, the, theory, is, dismissed, by, some, experts, particularly, in, james, s, case, because, he, had, kidney, stones, which, can, lead, to, blood, in, the, urine, colouring, it, red, in, early, 1625, james, was, plagued, by, severe, attacks, of, arthritis, gout, and, fainting, fits, and, fell, seriously, ill, in, march, with, tertian, ague, and, then, suffered, a, stroke, he, died, at, theobalds, house, in, hertfordshire, on, 27, march, during, a, violent, attack, of, dysentery, with, buckingham, at, his, bedside, james, s, funeral, on, 7, may, was, a, magnificent, but, disorderly, affair, bishop, john, williams, of, lincoln, preached, the, sermon, observing, king, solomon, died, in, peace, when, he, had, lived, about, sixty, years, and, so, you, know, did, king, james, the, sermon, was, later, printed, as, great, britain, s, salomon, james, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, the, position, of, the, tomb, was, lost, for, many, years, until, his, lead, coffin, was, found, in, the, henry, vii, vault, during, an, excavation, in, the, 19th, century, james, was, widely, mourned, for, all, his, flaws, he, had, largely, retained, the, affection, of, his, people, who, had, enjoyed, uninterrupted, peace, and, comparatively, low, taxation, during, the, jacobean, era, as, he, lived, in, peace, remarked, the, earl, of, kellie, so, did, he, die, in, peace, and, i, pray, god, our, king, may, follow, him, the, earl, prayed, in, vain, once, in, power, king, charles, i, and, the, duke, of, buckingham, sanctioned, a, series, of, reckless, military, expeditions, that, ended, in, humiliating, failure, james, had, often, neglected, the, business, of, government, for, leisure, pastimes, such, as, the, hunt, his, later, dependence, on, favourites, at, a, scandal, ridden, court, undermined, the, respected, image, of, monarchy, so, carefully, constructed, by, elizabeth, i, under, james, the, plantation, of, ulster, by, english, and, scots, protestants, began, and, the, english, colonisation, of, north, america, started, its, course, with, the, foundation, of, jamestown, virginia, in, 1607, and, cuper, s, cove, newfoundland, in, 1610, during, the, next, 150, years, england, would, fight, with, spain, the, netherlands, and, france, for, control, of, the, continent, while, religious, division, in, ireland, between, protestants, and, catholics, has, lasted, for, 400, years, by, actively, pursuing, more, than, just, a, personal, union, of, his, realms, james, helped, lay, the, foundations, for, a, unitary, british, state, according, to, a, tradition, originating, with, anti, stuart, historians, of, the, mid, 17th, century, james, s, taste, for, political, absolutism, his, financial, irresponsibility, and, his, cultivation, of, unpopular, favourites, established, the, foundations, of, the, english, civil, war, james, bequeathed, his, son, charles, a, fatal, belief, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, combined, with, a, disdain, for, parliament, which, culminated, in, the, execution, of, charles, i, and, the, abolition, of, the, monarchy, over, the, last, three, hundred, years, the, king, s, reputation, has, suffered, from, the, acid, description, of, him, by, anthony, weldon, whom, james, had, sacked, and, who, wrote, treatises, on, james, in, the, 1650s, other, influential, anti, james, histories, written, during, the, 1650s, include, edward, peyton, s, divine, catastrophe, of, the, kingly, family, of, the, house, of, stuarts, 1652, arthur, wilson, s, history, of, great, britain, being, the, life, and, reign, of, king, james, i, 1658, and, francis, osborne, s, historical, memoirs, of, the, reigns, of, queen, elizabeth, and, king, james, 1658, david, harris, willson, s, 1956, biography, continued, much, of, this, hostility, in, the, words, of, historian, jenny, wormald, willson, s, book, was, an, astonishing, spectacle, of, a, work, whose, every, page, proclaimed, its, author, s, increasing, hatred, for, his, subject, since, willson, however, the, stability, of, james, s, government, in, scotland, and, in, the, early, part, of, his, english, reign, as, well, as, his, relatively, enlightened, views, on, religion, and, war, have, earned, him, a, re, evaluation, from, many, historians, who, have, rescued, his, reputation, from, this, tradition, of, criticism, representative, of, the, new, historical, perspective, is, the, 2003, biography, by, pauline, croft, reviewer, john, cramsie, summarises, her, findings, croft, s, overall, assessment, of, james, is, appropriately, mixed, she, recognises, his, good, intentions, in, matters, like, anglo, scottish, union, his, openness, to, different, points, of, view, and, his, agenda, of, a, peaceful, foreign, policy, within, his, kingdoms, financial, means, his, actions, moderated, frictions, between, his, diverse, peoples, yet, he, also, created, new, ones, particularly, by, supporting, colonisation, that, polarised, the, crown, s, interest, groups, in, ireland, obtaining, insufficient, political, benefit, with, his, open, handed, patronage, an, unfortunate, lack, of, attention, to, the, image, of, monarchy, particularly, after, the, image, obsessed, regime, of, elizabeth, pursuing, a, pro, spanish, foreign, policy, that, fired, religious, prejudice, and, opened, the, door, for, arminians, within, the, english, church, and, enforcing, unpalatable, religious, changes, on, the, scottish, kirk, many, of, these, criticisms, are, framed, within, a, longer, view, of, james, reigns, including, the, legacy, now, understood, to, be, more, troubled, which, he, left, charles, i, in, scotland, james, was, james, the, sixth, king, of, scotland, until, 1604, he, was, proclaimed, james, the, first, king, of, england, france, and, ireland, defender, of, the, faith, in, london, on, 24, march, 1603, on, 20, october, 1604, james, issued, a, proclamation, at, westminster, changing, his, style, to, king, of, great, brittaine, france, and, ireland, defender, of, the, faith, c, the, style, was, not, used, on, english, statutes, but, was, used, on, proclamations, coinage, letters, treaties, and, in, scotland, james, styled, himself, king, of, france, in, line, with, other, monarchs, of, england, between, 1340, and, 1801, although, he, did, not, actually, rule, france, as, king, of, scotland, james, bore, the, ancient, royal, arms, of, scotland, or, a, lion, rampant, gules, armed, and, langued, azure, within, a, double, tressure, flory, counter, flory, gules, the, arms, were, supported, by, two, unicorns, argent, armed, crined, and, unguled, proper, gorged, with, a, coronet, or, composed, of, crosses, pat, e, and, fleurs, de, lys, a,

combining, their, arms, supporters, and, badges, contention, as, to, how, the, arms, should, be, marshalled, and, to, which, kingdom, should, take, precedence, was, solved, by, having, different, arms, for, each, country, the, arms, used, in, england, were, quarterly, i, and, iv, quarterly, 1st, and, 4th, azure, three, fleurs, de, lys, or, for, france, 2nd, and, 3rd, gules, three, lions,
