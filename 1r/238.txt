to, have, spent, his, whole, life, in, south, caucasus, according, to, de, blois, ganja, was, a, city, which, at, that, time, had, predominantly, an, iranian, population, the, armenian, historian, kirakos, gandzaketsi, c, 1200, 1271, mentions, that, this, city, was, densely, populated, with, iranians, and, a, small, number, of, christians, because, nizami, was, not, a, court, poet, he, does, not, appear, in, the, annals, of, the, dynasties, tazkerehs, which, are, the, compilations, of, literary, memoirs, that, include, maxims, of, the, great, poets, along, with, biographical, information, and, commentary, of, styles, refer, to, him, briefly, much, of, this, material, in, these, tazkerehs, are, based, on, legends, anecdotes, and, hearsays, consequently, few, facts, are, known, about, nezami, s, life, the, only, source, being, his, own, work, which, does, not, provide, much, information, on, his, personal, life, nizami, was, orphaned, early, and, was, raised, by, his, maternal, uncle, khwaja, umar, who, took, responsibility, for, him, and, afforded, him, an, excellent, education, his, mother, named, ra, isa, was, of, kurdish, origin, his, father, whose, name, was, yusuf, is, mentioned, once, by, nizami, in, his, poetry, in, the, same, verse, nizami, mentions, his, grandfather, s, name, as, zakki, in, part, of, the, same, verse, some, have, taken, the, word, mu, ayyad, as, a, title, for, zakki, while, others, have, interpreted, it, as, the, name, of, his, great, grandfather, some, sources, have, stated, that, his, father, might, be, possibly, from, qom, nizami, is, variously, mentioned, as, a, persian, and, or, iranian, nizami, was, married, three, times, his, first, wife, was, an, enslaved, kipchak, who, was, sent, to, him, by, fakhr, al, din, bahramshah, the,

my, eyes, in, haft, peykar, seven, beauties, he, also, mentions, and, advises, his, son, about, taking, more, responsibility, as, the, father, was, growing, more, frail, some, modern, writers, in, the, late, 20th, century, have, claimed, that, this, wife, was, called, afaq, vahid, dastgerdi, seems, to, be, the, first, writer, to, propose, this, name, for, nezami, s, first, wife, but, said, nafisi, at, the, same, time, and, a, recent, source, have, challenged, this, interpretation, of, the, corresponding, verse, in, nizami, s, work, and, the, assumption, that, afaq, was, the, real, name, of, his, wife, and, have, taken, the, afaq, in, that, verse, to, simply, mean, horizon, rather, than, a, proper, name, strangely, enough, nezami, s, two, other, wives, too, died, prematurely, the, death, of, each, coinciding, with, the, completion, of, an, epic, prompting, the, poet, to, say, god, why, is, it, that, for, every, mathnavi, i, must, sacrifice, a, wife, nizami, was, not, a, philosopher, in, the, sense, of, avicenna, or, an, expositor, of, theoretical, sufism, in, the, sense, of, ibn, arabi, however, he, is, regarded, as, a, philosopher, and, gnostic, who, mastered, various, fields, of, islamic, thoughts, which, he, synthesized, in, a, way, that, brings, to, mind, the, traditions, of, later, hakims, such, as, qutb, al, din, shirazi, often, referred, to, by, the, honorific, hakim, the, sage, nizami, is, both, a, learned, poet, and, master, of, a, lyrical, and, sensuous, style, about, nizami, s, prodigious, learning, there, is, no, doubt, poets, were, expected, to, be, well, versed, in, many, subjects, but, nizami, seems, to, have, been, exceptionally, so, his, poems, show, that, not, only, he, was, fully, acquainted, with, arabic, and, persian, literatures, and, with, oral, and, written, popular, and, local, traditions, but, was, also, familiar, with, such, diverse, fields, as, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, botany, koranic, exegesis, islamic, theory, and, law, iranian, myths, and, legends, history, ethics, philosophy, and, esoteric, thought, music, and, the, visual, arts, his, strong, character, social, sensibility, and, knowledge, of, oral, and, written, historical, records, as, well, as, his, rich, persian, cultural, heritage, unite, pre, islamic, and, islamic, iran, into, the, creation, of, a, new, standard, of, literary, achievement, being, a, product, of, the, iranian, culture, of, the, time, he, not, only, created, a, bridge, between, pre, islamic, and, islamic, iran, but, also, between, iran, and, the, whole, ancient, world, the, recent, discovery, and, publication, of, the, anthology, titled, nozhat, al, majales, contains, persian, language, quatrains, from, nizami, and, 115, other, poets, from, the, northwestern, iran, arr, n, arv, n, azerbaijan, including, 24, poets, from, ganja, alone, during, the, same, era, unlike, other, parts, of, persia, where, the, poets, mostly, belonged, to, higher, echelons, of, society, such, as, scholars, bureaucrats, and, secretaries, a, good, number, of, poets, in, the, northwestern, areas, rose, from, among, the, common, people, with, working, class, backgrounds, and, they, frequently, used, colloquial, expressions, in, their, poetry, accordingly, the, book, demonstrates, the, social, conditions, at, the, time, reflecting, the, full, spread, of, persian, language, and, the, culture, in, the, region, which, is, evidenced, by, the, common, use, of, spoken, idioms, in, poems, and, the, professions, of, many, of, the, poets, the, influence, of, the, northwestern, pahlavi, language, for, example, which, had, been, the, spoken, dialect, of, the, region, is, clearly, observed, in, the, poems, contained, in, this, anthology, however, at, the, same, time, the, caucasus, region, was, entertaining, a, unique, mixture, of, ethnic, cultures, khaqani, s, mother, was, a, nestorian, christian, mojir, baylqani, s, mother, was, an, armenian, and, nezami, s, mother, was, a, kurd, their, works, reflect, the, cultural, and, linguistic, diversity, of, the, region, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, persian, literature, became, widespread, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, the, banks, of, the, indus, the, earliest, extant, example, of, persian, poetry, from, the, area, is, that, of, qatran, tabrizi, 1009, 1072, who, served, in, the, courts, of, the, shaddadid, and, rawadid, dynasties, qatran, tabrizi, is, credited, with, what, some, scholars, in, the, last, century, have, termed, as, the, founder, of, the, azerbaijan, or, trans, cacausian, school, or, tabriz, school, or, shirvan, school, or, arranian, style, of, persian, poetry, this, school, produced, a, distinctive, style, of, poetry, in, persian, which, contrasted, with, khurasani, eastern, style, in, its, rhetorical, sophistication, its, innovative, use, of, metaphor, its, use, of, technical, terminology, and, christian, imagery, the, presence, of, persian, archaism, while, borrowing, from, arabic, vocabulary, as, well, as, new, concepts, other, sources, including, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, and, traditional, iranian, literary, sources, have, used, the, term, iraqi, style, for, the, persian, poetry, of, nezami, the, seljuqs, took, control, of, ganja, from, the, shaddadids, in, 1075, and, spread, persian, literary, westwards, to, their, courts, in, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, the, seljuk, empire, s, control, of, the, region, weakened, and, their, provincial, governors, virtually, autonomous, local, princes, further, encouraged, persian, culture, art, and, poetry, in, their, courts, persian, culture, characteristically, flourished, in, this, era, when, political, power, was, diffused, and, persian, remained, the, primary, language, persian, civil, servants, and, merchants, were, in, great, demand, and, rival, dynasties, continued, to, vie, for, the, service, of, persian, poets, this, was, especially, true, in, ganjeh, the, caucasian, outpost, town, where, nizami, lived, nezami, was, patronized, by, different, rulers, and, dedicated, his, epics, to, various, rival, dynasties, including, the, seljuqs, eldiguzids, who, maintained, control, of, ganja, during, most, of, the, later, 12th, century, shirvanshahs, the, ruler, of, ahar, and, ahmadilis, although, he, enjoyed, the, patronage, of, various, rulers, and, princes, he, avoided, the, courts, and, is, generally, believed, to, have, lived, a, secluded, life, since, he, was, not, a, court, poet, he, does, not, appear, in, the, annals, of, the, dynasties, which, list, the, names, of, events, of, the, ruling, families, according, to, literary, scholar, chelkowski, it, seems, that, nezami, s, favorite, pastime, was, reading, firdawsi, s, monumental, epic, shahnameh, the, book, of, kings, nezami, mentioned, ferdowsi, as, the, sage, hakim, and, knower, wise, daanaa, and, the, great, master, of, discourse, who, has, decorated, words, like, new, bride, nezami, advises, the, son, of, the, shirvanshah, to, read, the, shah, nama, and, to, remember, the, meaningful, sayings, of, the, wise, nezami, used, the, shahnameh, as, a, source, in, his, three, epics, of, haft, peykar, khosrow, and, shirin, and, eskandar, nameh, the, story, of, vis, and, ramin, also, had, an, immense, influence, on, nezami, although, nezami, takes, the, bases, for, most, of, his, plots, from, ferdowsi, but, the, basis, for, his, rhetoric, comes, from, gorgani, this, is, especially, noticeable, in, khosrow, and, shirin, which, is, of, the, same, meter, and, imitates, some, scenes, from, vis, and, ramin, nezami, s, concern, with, astrology, also, has, a, precedent, in, an, elaborate, astrological, description, of, the, night, sky, in, vis, and, ramin, nezami, had, a, paramount, influence, on, the, romantic, tradition, and, gorgani, can, be, said, to, have, initiated, much, of, the, distinctive, rhetoric, and, poetic, atmosphere, of, this, tradition, with, the, absence, of, the, sufi, influences, which, are, seen, in, nezami, s, epic, poetry, the, first, monumental, work, of, nezami, the, makhzan, al, asrar, is, influenced, by, sanai, s, hadikat, al, hakika, nezami, acknowledges, this, but, considers, his, work, to, be, superior, the, main, similarities, between, sanai, s, poem, and, nezami, s, are, in, its, ethico, philosophical, genre, although, nezami, uses, a, different, metre, and, organized, the, whole, work, in, a, different, fashion, khaqani, sherwani, daring, imagery, was, to, have, a, momentous, influence, on, nezami, ganjavi, and, through, the, latter, on, persian, poetry, in, general, nezami, lived, in, an, age, of, both, political, instability, and, intense, intellectual, activity, which, his, poems, reflect, but, little, is, known, about, his, life, his, relations, with, his, patrons, or, the, precise, dates, of, his, works, as, the, many, legends, built, up, around, the, poet, color, the, accounts, of, his, later, biographers, he, dedicated, his, poems, to, various, rulers, of, the, region, as, was, custom, of, that, time, for, great, poets, but, avoided, court, life, nezami, was, a, master, of, the, masnavi, style, double, rhymed, verses, nizami, s, main, poetical, work, for, which, he, is, best, known, is, a, set, of, five, long, narrative, poems, known, as, the, khamsa, quintet, or, quinary, or, panj, ganj, five, treasures, the, first, of, these, poems, makhzan, ol, asr, r, was, influenced, by, sanai, s, d, 1131, monumental, garden, of, truth, the, four, other, poems, are, medieval, romances, khosrow, and, shirin, bahram, e, gur, and, alexander, the, great, who, all, have, episodes, devoted, to, them, in, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, appear, again, here, at, the, center, of, three, of, four, of, nezami, s, narrative, poems, the, adventure, of, the, paired, lovers, layla, and, majnun, is, the, subject, of, the, second, of, his, four, romances, and, derived, from, arabic, sources, in, all, these, cases, nezami, reworked, the, material, from, his, sources, in, a, substantial, way, the, khamsa, was, a, popular, subject, for, lavish, manuscripts, illustrated, with, painted, miniatures, at, the, persian, and, mughal, courts, in, later, centuries, examples, include, the, khamsa, of, nizami, british, library, or, 12208, created, for, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, in, the, 1590s, the, ethico, philosophical, poems, of, about, 2, 250, persian, distichs, was, dedicated, to, fakhr, al, din, bahramshah, the, ruler, of, erzinjan, the, story, deals, with, such, esoteric, subjects, as, philosophy, and, theology, the, story, contains, twenty, discourses, each, of, them, portraying, an, exemplary, story, on, religious, and, ethical, topics, each, chapter, concludes, with, apostrophe, to, the, poet, himself, containing, his, pen, name, the, content, of, the, poems, are, indicated, in, the, heading, to, each, chapter, and, are, written, in, a, typical, homiletics, style, the, stories, which, discuss, spiritual, and, practical, concerns, enjoin, kingly, justice, riddance, of, hypocrisy, warning, of, vanity, of, this, world, and, the, need, to, prepare, for, the, after, life, the, general, message, of, the, discourse, is, that, nezami, preaches, the, ideal, way, of, life, drawing, attention, to, his, reader, of, the, supreme, rank, man, among, god, s, creatures, and, approaching, of, the, end, life, and, the, necessity, of, man, becoming, aware, of, his, spiritual, destination, in, a, few, chapters, he, address, the, duties, of, a, king, but, as, a, whole, he, addresses, himself, to, mankind, in, general, rather, than, to, his, royal, patrons, in, the, introduction, the, poet, provides, an, account, of, his, solitary, vigils, called, khalwat, there, is, no, indication, that, these, were, sufi, vigils, but, they, are, used, as, a, literary, fantasy, on, the, spiritually, inclined, poet, he, wanted, to, be, in, highly, rhetorical, style, the, aim, he, pursues, is, to, transcend, the, limitation, of, secular, literature, of, the, courts, with, this, work, nezami, joins, the, destination, of, persian, poetry, which, had, started, with, sanai, and, was, continued, by, others, in, the, first, place, by, attar, not, a, romantic, epic, the, treasury, of, mysteries, was, translated, into, english, by, gholam, h, darab, in, 1945, after, this, early, work, nezami, turned, towards, narrative, poetry, a, story, of, pre, islamic, persian, origin, which, is, found, in, the, great, epico, historical, poems, of, shahnameh, and, is, based, on, a, true, story, that, was, further, romanticized, by, persian, poets, the, story, chosen, by, nizami, was, commissioned, and, dedicated, to, the, seljuk, sultan, toghril, ii, the, atabek, muhammad, ibn, eldiguz, jahan, pahlavan, and, his, brother, qizil, arslan, it, contains, about, 6, 500, distichs, in, length, the, story, depicts, the, love, of, sasanian,

khosrow, endures, long, journeys, physical, and, spiritual, before, returning, to, shirin, his, true, love, they, are, eventually, married, but, finally, khosrow, is, killed, by, his, son, and, shirin, commits, suicide, over, the, body, of, her, murdered, husband, pure, and, selfless, love, is, represented, here, embodied, in, the, figure, of, farhad, secretly, in, love, with, shirin, who, falls, victim, to, the, king, s, ire, and, jealousy, the, influence, of, vis, o, ramin, is, visible, as, the, poem, imitates, a, major, scene, that, of, the, lovers, arguing, in, the, snow, from, vis, o, r, min, as, well, as, being, in, the, same, meter, hazaj, as, gorg, ni, s, poem, nezami, s, concern, with, astrology, also, has, a, precedent, in, an, elaborate, astrological, description, of, the, night, sky, in, vis, o, r, min, in, turn, nezami, s, great, work, had, a, tremendous, influence, on, later, authors, and, many, imitations, of, this, work, were, made, with, complete, artistic, and, structural, unity, the, epic, of, khosrow, o, shirin, turned, to, be, a, turning, point, not, only, for, nizami, but, for, all, of, persian, literature, a, story, of, arabic, origin, which, was, later, adapted, and, embellished, by, the, persians, the, poem, of, 4, 600, distichs, was, dedicated, in, 1192, to, abu, al, muzaffar, shirvanshah, who, claimed, descent, from, the, sasanian, king,

his, cousin, layla, but, is, prevented, from, marrying, her, by, layla, s, father, layla, s, father, forbids, contact, with, qays, so, that, qays, becomes, obsessed, and, starts, singing, of, his, love, for, layla, in, public, the, obsession, becomes, so, severe, that, he, sees, and, evaluates, everything, in, terms, of, layla, hence, his, sobriquet, the, possessed, majnun, realizing, that, he, cannot, obtain, union, even, when, other, people, intercede, for, him, he, leaves, society, and, roams, naked, in, the, desert, among, the, beasts, however, the, image, of, layla, was, so, ingrained, in, him, that, he, cannot, eat, or, sleep, his, only, activity, becomes, composing, poetry, of, longing, for, layla, meanwhile, layla, is, married, against, her, will, but, she, guards, her, virginity, by, resisting, the, advances, of, her, husband, in, a, secret, meeting, with, majnun, they, meet, but, have, no, physical, contact, rather, they, recite, poetry, to, each, other, from, a, distance, layla, s, husband, dies, eventually, which, removes, the, legal, obstacles, to, a, licit, union, however, majnun, is, so, focused, on, the, ideal, picture, of, layla, in, his, mind, that, he, fled, into, the, desert, again, layla, dies, out, of, grief, and, is, buried, in, her, bridal, dress, hearing, this, news, majun, rushes, to, her, grave, where, he, instantly, dies, they, are, buried, side, by, side, and, their, grave, becomes, a, site, of, pilgrimage, someone, dreams, that, in, paradise, they, are, united, and, live, as, a, king, and, queen, nezami, composed, his, romance, at, the, request, of, the, shirvanshah, akhsatan, initially, he, doubted, that, this, simple, story, about, the, agony, and, pain, of, an, arab, boy, wandering, in, rough, mountains, and, burning, deserts, would, be, a, suitable, subject, for, royal, court, poetry, and, his, cultured, audience, it, was, his, son, who, persuaded, him, to, undertake, the, project, saying, wherever, tales, of, love, are, read, this, will, add, spice, to, them, nezami, used, many, arabic, anecdotes, in, the, story, but, also, adds, a, strong, persian, flavor, to, the, legend, an, important, aspect, of, layla, and, majun, is, the, poet, s, highly, humanitarian, approach, during, the, war, by, nawfal, in, favor, of, majnun, the, latter, is, unhappy, wishing, the, termination, of, the, war, majun, gives, away, his, horse, and, amours, to, save, a, gazelle, and, a, stag, nezami, gave, a, persian, character, to, the, poem, by, adding, several, techniques, borrowed, from, the, persian, epic, tradition, such, as, the, portrayal, of, characters, the, relationship, between, characters, description, of, time, and, setting, etc, further, he, adapted, the, different, stories, about, majnun, to, fit, a, well, crafted, persian, romantic, epic, the, story, of, layla, and, majnun, by, nizami, was, edited, and, translated, into, english, by, swiss, scholar, of, islamic, culture, rudolf, gelpke, and, published, in, 1966, a, comprehensive, analysis, in, english, containing, partial, translations, of, nezami, s, romance, layla, and, majnun, examining, key, themes, such, as, chastity, constancy,
