alchemy, theories, while, abulfaraj, and, casiri, claimed, that, the, cause, was, a, diet, of, beans, only, allegedly, he, was, approached, by, a, physician, offering, an, ointment, to, cure, his, blindness, al, razi, then, asked, him, how, many, layers, does, the, eye, contain, and, when, he, was, unable, to, receive, an, answer, he, declined, the, treatment, stating, my, eyes, will, not, be, treated, by, one, who, does, not, know, the, basics, of, its, anatomy, the, lectures, of, al, razi, attracted, many, students, as, ibn, al, nadim, relates, in, fihrist, al, razi, was, considered, a, shaikh, an, honorary, title, given, to, one, entitled, to, teach, and, surrounded, by, several, circles, of, students, when, someone, raised, a, question, it, was, passed, on, to, students, of, the,

mature, wine, at, this, stage, smallpox, shows, up, essentially, as, bubbles, found, in, wine, as, blisters, this, disease, can, also, occur, at, other, times, meaning, not, only, during, childhood, the, best, thing, to, do, during, this, first, stage, is, to, keep, away, from, it, otherwise, this, disease, might, turn, into, an, epidemic, al, razi, s, book, al, judari, wa, al, hasbah, on, smallpox, and, measles, was, the, first, book, describing, smallpox, and, measles, as, distinct, diseases, it, was, translated, more, than, a, dozen, times, into, latin, and, other, european, languages, its, lack, of, dogmatism, and, its, hippocratic, reliance, on, clinical, observation, show, al, razi, s, medical, methods, for, example, he, wrote, the, eruption, of, smallpox, is, preceded, by, a, continued, fever, pain, in, the, back, itching, in, the, nose, and, nightmares, during, sleep, these, are, the, more, acute, symptoms, of, its, approach, together, with, a, noticeable, pain, in, the, back, accompanied, by, fever, and, an, itching, felt, by, the, patient, all, over, his, body, a, swelling, of, the, face, appears, which, comes, and, goes, and, one,

experiences, heat, over, the, whole, body, one, has, an, inflamed, colon, and, one, shows, an, overall, shining, redness, with, a, very, pronounced, redness, of, the, gums, rhazes, encyclopaedia, of, medicine, al, razi, compared, the, outcome, of, patients, with, meningitis, treated, with, blood, letting, with, the, outcome, of, those, treated, without, it, to, see, if, blood, letting, could, help, al, razi, contributed, in, many, ways, to, the, early, practice, of, pharmacy, by, compiling, texts, in, which, he, introduces, the, use, of, mercurial, ointments, and, his, development, of, apparatus, such, as, mortars, flasks, spatulas, and, phials, which, were, used, in, pharmacies, until, the, early, twentieth, century, on, a, professional, level, al, razi, introduced, many, practical, progressive, medical, and, psychological, ideas, he, attacked, charlatans, and, fake, doctors, who, roamed, the, cities, and, countryside, selling, their, nostrums, and, cures, at, the, same, time, he, warned, that, even, highly, educated, doctors, did, not, have, the, answers, to, all, medical, problems, and, could, not, cure, all, sicknesses, or, heal, every, disease, which, was, humanly, speaking, impossible, to, become, more, useful, in, their, services, and, truer, to, their, calling, al, razi, advised, practitioners, to, keep, up, with, advanced, knowledge, by, continually, studying, medical, books, and, exposing, themselves, to, new, information, he, made, a, distinction, between, curable, and, incurable, diseases, pertaining, to, the, latter, he, commented, that, in, the, case, of, advanced, cases, of, cancer, and, leprosy, the, physician, should, not, be, blamed, when, he, could, not, cure, them, to, add, a, humorous, note, al, razi, felt, great, pity, for, physicians, who, took, care, for, the, well, being, of, princes, nobility, and, women, because, they, did, not, obey, the, doctor, s, orders, to, restrict, their, diet, or, get, medical, treatment, thus, making, it, most, difficult, being, their, physician, he, also, wrote, the, following, on, medical, ethics, the, doctor, s, aim, is, to, do, good, even, to, our, enemies, so, much, more, to, our, friends, and, my, profession, forbids, us, to, do, harm, to, our, kindred, as, it, is, instituted, for, the, benefit, and, welfare, of, the, human, race, and, god, imposed, on, physicians, the, oath, not, to, compose, mortiferous, remedies, this, 23, volume, set, medical, textbooks, contains, the, foundation, of, gynaecology, obstetrics, and, ophthalmic, surgery, this, monumental, medical, encyclopedia, in, nine, volumes, known, in, europe, also, as, the, large, comprehensive, or, continens, liber, contains, considerations, and, criticism, on, the, greek, philosophers, aristotle, and, plato, and, expresses, innovative, views, on, many, subjects, because, of, this, book, alone, many, scholars, consider, al, razi, the, greatest, medical, doctor, of, the, middle, ages, the, al, hawi, is, not, a, formal, medical, encyclopedia, but, a, posthumous, compilation, of, al, razi, s, working, notebooks, which, included, knowledge, gathered, from, other, books, as, well, as, original, observations, on, diseases, and, therapies, based, on, his, own, clinical, experience, it, is, significant, since, it, contains, a, celebrated, monograph, on, smallpox, the, earliest, one, known, it, was, translated, into, latin, in, 1279, by, faraj, ben, salim, a, physician, of, sicilian, jewish, origin, employed, by, charles, of, anjou, and, after, which, it, had, a, considerable, influence, in, europe, the, al, hawi, also, criticized, the, views, of, galen, after, al, razi, had, observed, many, clinical, cases, which, did, not, follow, galen, s, descriptions, of, fevers, for, example, he, stated, that, galen, s, descriptions, of, urinary, ailments, were, inaccurate, as, he, had, only, seen, three, cases, while, al, razi, had, studied, hundreds, of, such, cases, in, hospitals, of, baghdad, and, rey, al, razi, was, possibly, the, first, persian, doctor, to, deliberately, write, a, home, medical, manual, remedial, directed, at, the, general, public, he, dedicated, it, to, the, poor, the, traveller, and, the, ordinary, citizen, who, could, consult, it, for, treatment, of, common, ailments, when, a, doctor, was, not, available, this, book, is, of, special, interest, to, the, history, of, pharmacy, since, similar, books, were, very, popular, until, the, 20th, century, al, razi, described, in, its, 36, chapters, diets, and, drug, components, that, can, be, found, in, either, an, apothecary, a, market, place, in, well, equipped, kitchens, or, and, in, military, camps, thus, every, intelligent, person, could, follow, its, instructions, and, prepare, the, proper, recipes, with, good, results, some, of, the, illnesses, treated, were, headaches, colds, coughing, melancholy, and, diseases, of, the, eye, ear, and, stomach, for, example, he, prescribed, for, a, feverish, headache, 2, parts, of, duhn, oily, extract, of, rose, to, be, mixed, with, 1, part, of, vinegar, in, which, a, piece, of, linen, cloth, is, dipped, and, compressed, on, the, forehead, he, recommended, as, a, laxative, 7, drams, of, dried, violet, flowers, with, 20, pears, macerated, and, well, mixed, then, strained, add, to, this, filtrate, 20, drams, of, sugar, for, a, drink, in, cases, of, melancholy, he, invariably, recommended, prescriptions, which, included, either, poppies, or, its, juice, opium, cuscuta, epithymum, clover, dodder, or, both, for, an, eye, remedy, he, advised, myrrh, saffron, and, frankincense, 2, drams, each, to, be, mixed, with, 1, dram, of, yellow, arsenic, formed, into, tablets, each, tablet, was, to, be, dissolved, in, a, sufficient, quantity, of, coriander, water, and, used, as, eye, drops, al, razi, dedicated, this, work, to, his, patron, ab, li, al, man, r, the, samanid, governor, of, ray, it, was, translated, into, latin, by, gerard, of, cremona, around, 1180, a, latin, translation, of, it, was, edited, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, dutch, anatomist, and, physician, andreas, vesalius, in, his, book, doubts, about, galen, al, razi, rejects, several, claims, made, by, the, greek, physician, as, far, as, the, alleged, superiority, of, the, greek, language, and, many, of, his, cosmological, and, medical, views, he, links, medicine, with, philosophy, and, states, that, sound, practice, demands, independent, thinking, he, reports, that, galen, s, descriptions, do, not, agree, with, his, own, clinical, observations, regarding, the, run, of, a, fever, and, in, some, cases, he, finds, that, his, clinical, experience, exceeds, galen, s, he, criticized, galen, s, theory, that, the, body, possessed, four, separate, humors, liquid, substances, whose, balance, are, the, key, to, health, and, a, natural, body, temperature, a, sure, way, to, upset, such, a, system, was, to, insert, a, liquid, with, a, different, temperature, into, the, body, resulting, in, an, increase, or, decrease, of, bodily, heat, which, resembled, the, temperature, of, that, particular, fluid, al, razi, noted, that, a, warm, drink, would, heat, up, the, body, to, a, degree, much, higher, than, its, own, natural, temperature, thus, the, drink, would, trigger, a, response, from, the, body, rather, than, transferring, only, its, own, warmth, or, coldness, to, it, cf, i, e, goodman, this, line, of, criticism, essentially, had, the, potential, to, completely, refute, galen, s, theory, of, humors, as, well, as, aristotle, s, theory, of, the, four, elements, on, which, it, was, grounded, al, razi, s, own, alchemical, experiments, suggested, other, qualities, of, matter, such, as, oiliness, and, sulphurousness, or, inflammability, and, salinity, which, were, not, readily, explained, by, the, traditional, fire, water, earth, and, air, division, of, elements, al, razi, s, challenge, to, the, current, fundamentals, of, medical, theory, was, quite, controversial, many, accused, him, of, ignorance, and, arrogance, even, though, he, repeatedly, expressed, his, praise, and, gratitude, to, galen, for, his, contributions, and, labours, saying, i, prayed, to, god, to, direct, and, lead, me, to, the, truth, in, writing, this, book, it, grieves, me, to, oppose, and, criticize, the, man, galen, from, whose, sea, of, knowledge, i, have, drawn, much, indeed, he, is, the, master, and, i, am, the, disciple, although, this, reverence, and, appreciation, will, and, should, not, prevent, me, from, doubting, as, i, did, what, is, erroneous, in, his, theories, i, imagine, and, feel, deeply, in, my, heart, that, galen, has, chosen, me, to, undertake, this, task, and, if, he, were, alive, he, would, have, congratulated, me, on, what, i, am, doing, i, say, this, because, galen, s, aim, was, to, seek, and, find, the, truth, and, bring, light, out, of, darkness, i, wish, indeed, he, were, alive, to, read, what, i, have, published, al, razi, s, the, diseases, of, children, was, the, first, monograph, to, deal, with, pediatrics, as, an, independent, field, of, medicine, al, razi, s, interest, in, alchemy, and, his, strong, belief, in, the, possibility, of, transmutation, of, lesser, metals, to, silver, and, gold, was, attested, half, a, century, after, his, death, by, ibn, an, nadim, s, book, the, philosopher, s, stone, lapis, philosophorum, in, latin, nadim, attributed, a, series, of, twelve, books, to, al, razi, plus, an, additional, seven, including, his, refutation, to, al, kindi, s, denial, of, the, validity, of, alchemy, al, kindi, 801, 873, ce, had, been, appointed, by, the, abbasid, caliph, ma, mun, founder, of, baghdad, to, the, house, of, wisdom, in, that, city, he, was, a, philosopher, and, an, opponent, of, alchemy, al, razi, s, two, best, known, alchemical, texts, which, largely, superseded, his, earlier, ones, al, asrar, the, secrets, and, sirr, al, asrar, the, secret, of, secrets, which, incorporates, much, of, the, previous, work, apparently, al, razi, s, contemporaries, believed, that, he, had, obtained, the, secret, of, turning, iron, and, copper, into, gold, biographer, khosro, moetazed, reports, in, mohammad, zakaria, razi, that, a, certain, general, simjur, confronted, al, razi, in, public, and, asked, whether, that, was, the, underlying, reason, for, his, willingness, to, treat, patients, without, a, fee, it, appeared, to, those, present, that, al, razi, was, reluctant, to, answer, he, looked, sideways, at, the, general, and, replied, i, understand, alchemy, and, i, have, been, working, on, the, characteristic, properties, of, metals, for, an, extended, time, however, it, still, has, not, turned, out, to, be, evident, to, me, how, one, can, transmute, gold, from, copper, despite, the, research, from, the, ancient, scientists, done, over, the, past, centuries, there, has, been, no, answer, i, very, much, doubt, if, it, is, possible, al, razi, s, works, present, the, first, systematic, classification, of, carefully, observed, and, verified, facts, regarding, chemical, substances, reactions, and, apparatus, described, in, a, language, almost, entirely, free, from, mysticism, and, ambiguity, the, secrets, al, asrar, kit, b, al, asr, r, book, of, secrets, was, written, in, response, to, a, request, from, al, razi, s, close, friend, colleague, and, former, student, abu, muhammad, ibn, yunis, al, bukhari, a, muslim, mathematician, philosopher, and, natural, scientist, this, is, al, razi, s, most, famous, book, here, he, gives, systematic, attention, to, basic, chemical, operations, important, to, the, history, of, pharmacy, in, this, book, al, razi, divides, the, subject, of, matter, into, three, categories, as, in, his, previous, book, al, asrar, similar, to, the, commentary, on, the, 8th, century, text, on, amalgams, ascribed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, al, razi, gives, methods, and, procedures, of, coloring, a, silver, object, to, imitate, gold, gold, leafing, and, the, reverse, technique, of, removing, its, color, back, to, silver, gilding, and, silvering, of, other, metals, alum, calcium, salts, iron, copper, and, tutty, are, also, described, as, well, as, how, colors, will, last, for, years, without, tarnishing, or, changing, al, razi, classified, minerals, into, six, divisions, al, razi, gives, also, a, list, of, apparatus, used, in, alchemy, this, consists, of, 2, classes, although, al, razi, wrote, extensively, on, philosophy, most, of, his, works, on, this, subject, are, now, lost, most, of, his, religio, philosophical, ideas, including, his, belief, in, five, eternal, principles, are, only, known, from, fragments, and, testimonies, found, in, other, authors, who, were, often, strongly, opposed, to, his, thought, al, razi, s, metaphysical, doctrine, derives, from, the, theory, of, the, five, eternals, according, to, which, the, world, is, produced, out, of, an, interaction, between, god, and, four, other, eternal, principles, soul, matter, time, and, place, he, accepted, a, pre, socratic, type, of, atomism, of, the, bodies, and, for, that, he, differed, from, both, the, falasifa, and, the, mutakallimun, while, he, was, influenced, by, plato, and, the, medical, writers, mainly, galen, he, rejected, taqlid, and, thus, expressed, criticism, about, some, of, their, views, this, is, evident, from, the, title, of, one, of, his, works, doubts, about, galen, a, number, of, contradictory, works, and, statements, about, religion, have, been, ascribed, to, al, razi, many, sources, claim, that, al, razi, viewed, prophecy, and, revealed, religion, as, unnecessary, and, delusional, claiming, that, all, humans, have, the, ability, to, access, and, discover, truth, including, the, existence, of, god, through, god, given, reason, according, to, these, sources, his, skepticism, of, prophecy, and, view, that, no, one, group, or, religion, has, privileged, access, to, the, truth, is, driven, by, his, view, that, all, people, have, an, equal, basic, capacity, for, rationality, and, discovery, of, truth, and, that, apparent, differences, in, this, capacity, are, simply, a, feature, of, interest, opportunity, and, effort, because, of, his, supposed, rejection, of, prophecy, and, acceptance, of, reason, as, the, primary, method, for, accessing, the, truth, al, razi, came, to, be, admired, as, a, freethinker, by, some, according, to, al, biruni, s, bibliography, of, al, razi, ris, la, f, fihrist, kutub, al, r, z, al, razi, wrote, two, heretical, books, f, al, nubuww, t, on, prophecies, and, f, iyal, al, mutanabb, n, on, the, tricks, of, false, prophets, according, to, biruni, the, first, was, claimed, to, be, against, religions, and, the, second, was, claimed, as, attacking, the, necessity, of, the, prophets, however, biruni, also, listed, some, other, works, of, al, razi, on, religion, including, fi, wujub, da, wat, al, nabi, ala, man, nakara, bi, al, nubuwwat, obligation, to, propagate, the, teachings, of, the, prophet, against, those, who, denied, prophecies, and, fi, anna, li, al, insan, khaliqan, mutqinan, hakiman, that, man, has, a, wise, and, perfect, creator, listed, under, his, works, on, the, divine, sciences, none, of, his, works, on, religion, are, now, extant, in, full, sarah, stroumsa, has, argued, that, al, razi, was, a, freethinker, who, rejected, all, revealed, religions, however, peter, adamson, marwan, rashed, and, others, hold, that, al, razi, did, not, reject, revealed, religion, on, the, basis, of, more, recent, evidence, found, in, the, writings, of, the, theologian, and, philosopher, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, died, 1210, adamson, states, it, is, worth, noting, that, stroumsa, s, work, predates, rashed, s, discovery, of, this, evidence, in, fakhr, al, d, n, so, that, she, did, not, have, the, benefit, of, being, able, to, consider, how, this, new, information, could, be, reconciled, with, the, proofs, that, is, the, goal, i, will, set, for, myself, in, this, chapter, i, should, lay, my, cards, on, the, table, and, say, that, i, am, persuaded, by, rashed, s, account, and, do, not, believe, that, razi, was, staging, a, general, attack, on, prophecy, or, religion, as, ab, tim, would, have, us, think, the, views, and, quotes, that,

which, documents, a, debate, between, abu, hatim, and, al, razi, abu, hatim, was, an, isma, ili, missionary, who, debated, al, razi, but, whether, he, has, faithfully, recorded, the, views, of, al, razi, is, disputed, some, historians, claim, that, abu, hatim, accurately, represented, al, razi, s, scepticism, of, revealed, religion, while, others, argue, that, abu, hatim, s, work, should, be, treated, with, scepticism, given, that, he, is, a, hostile, source, of, al, razi, s, beliefs, and, might, have, portrayed, him, as, a, heretic, to, discount, his, critique, of, the, ism, l, s,
