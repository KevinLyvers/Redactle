one, detail, after, another, into, place, like, iron, scraps, attaching, to, a, magnet, and, in, this, way, an, overall, picture, of, a, person, materializes, afterward, i, often, think, that, certain, details, resemble, those, of, a, real, person, but, most, of, the, process, happens, automatically, i, think, i, almost, unconsciously, pull, information, and, various, fragments, from, the, cabinets, in, my, brain, and, then, weave, them, together, murakami, named, this, process, the, automatic, dwarfs, he, continued, one, of, the, things, i, most, enjoy, about, writing, novels, is, the, sense, that, i, can, become, anybody, i, want, to, be, noting, that, characters, who, are, in, a, literary, sense, alive, will, eventually, break, free, of, the, writer, s, control, and, begin, to,
