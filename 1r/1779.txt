the, generating, circles, of, these, hypocycloids, later, named, cardano, circles, or, cardanic, circles, were, used, for, the, construction, of, the, first, high, speed, printing, presses, today, cardano, is, well, known, for, his, achievements, in, algebra, in, his, 1545, book, ars, magna, he, made, the, first, systematic, use, of, negative, numbers, in, europe, published, with, attribution, the, solutions, of, other, mathematicians, for, cubic, and, quartic, equations, and, acknowledged, the, existence, of, imaginary, numbers, cardano, was, born, on, 24, september, 1501, in, pavia, lombardy, the, illegitimate, child, of, fazio, cardano, a, mathematically, gifted, jurist, lawyer, and, close, friend, of, leonardo, da, vinci, in, his, autobiography, cardano, wrote, that, his, mother, chiara, micheri, had, taken, various, abortive, medicines, to, terminate, the, pregnancy, he, said, i, was, taken, by, violent, means, from, my, mother, i, was, almost, dead, she, was, in,

depressing, childhood, with, frequent, illnesses, and, the, rough, upbringing, by, his, overbearing, father, in, 1520, cardano, entered, the, university, of, pavia, against, the, wish, of, his, father, who, wanted, his, son, to, undertake, studies, of, law, girolamo, felt, more, attracted, to, philosophy, and, science, during, the, italian, war, of, 1521, 1526, however, the, authorities, in, pavia, were, forced, to, close, the, university, in, 1524, cardano, resumed, his, studies, at, the, university, of, padua, where, he, graduated, with, a, doctorate, in, medicine, in, 1525, his, eccentric, and, confrontational, style, did, not, earn, him, many, friends, and, he, had, a, difficult, time, finding, work, after, he, completed, his, studies, in, 1525, cardano, repeatedly, applied, to, the, college, of, physicians, in, milan, but, was, not, admitted, owing, to, his, combative, reputation, and, illegitimate, birth, however, he, was, consulted, by, many, members, of, the, college, of, physicians, because, of, his, irrefutable, intelligence, cardano, wanted, to, practice, medicine, in, a, large, rich, city, like, milan, but, he, was, denied, a, license, to, practice, so, he, settled, for, the, town, of, piove, di, sacco, where, he, practised, without, a, license, there, he, married, lucia, banderini, in, 1531, before, her, death, in, 1546, they, had, three, children, giovanni, battista, 1534, chiara, 1537, and, aldo, urbano, 1543, cardano, later, wrote, that, those, were, the, happiest, days, of, his, life, with, the, help, of, a, few, noblemen, cardano, obtained, a, mathematics, teaching, position, in, milan, having, finally, received, his, medical, license, he, practised, mathematics, and, medicine, simultaneously, treating, a, few, influential, patients, in, the, process, because, of, this, he, became, one, of, the, most, sought, after, doctors, in, milan, in, fact, by, 1536, he, was, able, to, quit, his, teaching, position, although, he, was, still, interested, in, mathematics, his, notability, in, the, medical, field, was, such, that, the, aristocracy, tried, to, lure, him, out, of, milan, cardano, later, wrote, that, he, turned, down, offers, from, the, kings, of, denmark, and, france, and, the, queen, of, scotland, gerolamo, cardano, was, the, first, european, mathematician, to, make, systematic, use, of, negative, numbers, he, published, with, attribution, the, solution, of, scipione, del, ferro, to, the, cubic, equation, and, the, solution, of, cardano, s, student, lodovico, ferrari, to, the, quartic, equation, in, his, 1545, book, ars, magna, an, influential, work, on, algebra, the, solution, to, one, particular, case, of, the, cubic, equation, a, x, 3, b, x, c, 0, displaystyle, ax, 3, bx, c, 0, in, modern, notation, had, been, communicated, to, him, in, 1539, by, niccol, fontana, tartaglia, who, later, claimed, that, cardano, had, sworn, not, to, reveal, it, and, engaged, cardano, in, a, decade, long, dispute, in, the, form, of, a, poem, but, del, ferro, s, solution, predated, tartaglia, s, in, his, exposition, he, acknowledged, the, existence, of, what, are, now, called, imaginary, numbers, although, he, did, not, understand, their, properties, described, for, the, first, time, by, his, italian, contemporary, rafael, bombelli, in, opus, novum, de, proportionibus, he, introduced, the, binomial, coefficients, and, the, binomial, theorem, cardano, was, notoriously, short, of, money, and, kept, himself, solvent, by, being, an, accomplished, gambler, and, chess, player, his, book, about, games, of, chance, liber, de, ludo, aleae, book, on, games, of, chance, written, around, 1564, but, not, published, until, 1663, contains, the, first, systematic, treatment, of, probability, as, well, as, a, section, on, effective, cheating, methods, he, used, the, game, of, throwing, dice, to, understand, the, basic, concepts, of, probability, he, demonstrated, the, efficacy, of, defining, odds, as, the, ratio, of, favourable, to, unfavourable, outcomes, which, implies, that, the, probability, of, an, event, is, given, by, the, ratio, of, favourable, outcomes, to, the, total, number, of, possible, outcomes, he, was, also, aware, of, the, multiplication, rule, for, independent, events, but, was, not, certain, about, what, values, should, be, multiplied, cardano, was, a, music, theorist, who, studied, music, privately, in, milan, in, his, youth, he, wrote, two, treatises, on, music, both, of, which, were, titled, de, musica, the, first, was, published, within, his, 1663, work, hieronymi, cardani, mediolanensis, opera, omnia, it, is, of, interest, to, scholars, on, the, history, of, woodwind, instruments, because, of, its, discussion, of, instruments, from, that, family, the, second, treatise, was, published, in, 1574, and, a, copy, of, it, is, held, in, the, vatican, library, the, work, is, valuable, for, studies, in, harmony, for, its, discussion, of, the, use, of, microtones, it, is, also, of, interest, to, scholars, of, historically, informed, performance, practice, for, its, details, on, 16th, century, performance, the, later, treatise, of, music, della, natura, de, principii, et, regole, musicali, which, has, been, attributed, to, cardano, by, some, is, according, to, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, most, likely, falsely, attributed, to, cardano, and, is, by, another, writer, cardano, also, dabbled, in, composing, writing, the, motet, beati, estis, which, is, scored, for, 12, voices, and, contains, four, overlapping, canons, cardano, s, work, with, hypocycloids, led, him, to, cardan, s, movement, or, cardan, gear, mechanism, in, which, a, pair, of, gears, with, the, smaller, being, one, half, the, size, of, the, larger, gear, is, used, to, convert, rotational, motion, to, linear, motion, with, greater, efficiency, and, precision, than, a, scotch, yoke, for, example, he, is, also, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, cardan, suspension, or, gimbal, cardano, made, several, contributions, to, hydrodynamics, and, held, that, perpetual, motion, is, impossible, except, in, celestial, bodies, he, published, two, encyclopedias, of, natural, science, which, contain, a, wide, variety, of, inventions, facts, and, occult, superstitions, he, also, introduced, the, cardan, grille, a, cryptographic, writing, tool, in, 1550, significantly, in, the, history, of, education, of, the, deaf, he, said, that, deaf, people, were, capable, of, using, their, minds, argued, for, the, importance, of, teaching, them, and, was, one, of, the, first, to, state, that, deaf, people, could, learn, to, read, and, write, without, learning, how, to, speak, first, he, was, familiar, with, a, report, by, rudolph, agricola, about, a, deaf, mute, who, had, learned, to, write, cardano, s, medical, writings, included, a, commentary, on, mundinus, anatomy, and, of, galen, s, medicine, along, with, the, treaties, delle, cause, dei, segni, e, dei, luoghi, delle, malattie, picciola, terapeutica, degli, abusi, dei, medici, and, delle, orine, libro, quattro, cardano, has, been, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, so, called, cardano, s, rings, also, called, chinese, rings, but, it, is, very, probable, that, they, predate, cardano, the, universal, joint, sometimes, called, cardan, joint, was, not, described, by, cardano, as, quoted, from, charles, lyell, s, principles, of, geology, the, title, of, a, work, of, cardano, s, published, in, 1552, de, subtilitate, corresponding, to, what, would, now, be, called, transcendental, philosophy, would, lead, us, to, expect, in, the, chapter, on, minerals, many, far, fetched, theories, characteristic, of, that, age, but, when, treating, of, petrified, shells, he, decided, that, they, clearly, indicated, the, former, sojourn, of, the, sea, upon, the, mountains, in, 1552, cardano, travelled, to, scotland, with, the, spanish, physician, william, casanatus, via, london, to, treat, the, archbishop, of, st, andrews, who, suffered, of, a, disease, that, had, left, him, speechless, and, was, thought, incurable, the, treatment, was, a, success, and, the, diplomat, thomas, randolph, recorded, that, merry, tales, about, cardano, s, methods, were, still, current, in, edinburgh, in, 1562, cardano, and, casanatus, argued, over, the, archbishop, s, cure, cardano, wrote, that, the, archbishop, had, been, short, of, breath, for, ten, years, and, after, the, cure, was, effected, by, his, assistant, he, was, paid, 1, 400, gold, crowns, two, of, cardano, s, children, giovanni, battista, and, aldo, urbano, came, to, ignoble, ends, giovanni, battista, cardano, s, eldest, and, favourite, son, was, arrested, in, 1560, for, having, poisoned, his, wife, after, he, had, discovered, that, their, three, children, were, not, his, giovanni, was, put, to, trial, and, when, cardano, could, not, pay, the, restitution, demanded, by, the, victim, s, family, was, sentenced, to, death, and, beheaded, gerolamo, s, other, son, aldo, urbano, was, a, gambler, who, stole, money, from, his, father, and, so, cardano, disinherited, him, in, 1569, cardano, moved, from, pavia, to, bologna, in, part, because, he, believed, that, the, decision, to, execute, his, son, was, influenced, by, gerolamo, s, battles, with, the, academic, establishment, in, pavia, and, his, colleagues, jealousy, at, his, scientific, achievements, and, also, because, he, was, beset, with, allegations, of, sexual, impropriety, with, his, students, he, obtained, a, position, as, professor, of, medicine, at, the, university, of, bologna, cardano, was, arrested, by, the, inquisition, in, 1570, after, an, accusation, of, heresy, by, the, inquisitor, of, como, who, targeted, cardano, s, de, rerum, varietate, 1557, the, inquisitors, complained, about, cardano, s, writings, on, astrology, especially, his, claim, that, self, harming, religiously, motivated, actions, of, martyrs, and, heretics, were, caused, by, the, stars, in, his, 1543, book, de, supplemento, almanach, a, commentary, on, the, astrological, work, tetrabiblos, by, ptolemy, cardano, had, also, published, a, horoscope, of, jesus, cardano, was, imprisoned, for, several, months, and, lost, his, professorship, in, bologna, he, abjured, and, was, freed, probably, with, help, from, powerful, churchmen, in, rome, all, his, non, medical, works, were, prohibited, and, placed, on, the, index, he, moved, to, rome, where, he, received, a, lifetime, annuity, from, pope, gregory, xiii, after, first, having, been, rejected, by, pope, pius, v, who, died, in, 1572, and, finished, his, autobiography, he, was, accepted, into, the, royal, college, of, physicians, and, as, well, as, practising, medicine, he, continued, his, philosophical, studies, until, his, death, in, 1576, the, seventeenth, century, english, physician, and, philosopher, sir, thomas, browne, possessed, the, ten, volumes, of, the, lyon, 1663, edition, of, the, complete, works, of, cardan, in, his, library, browne, critically, viewed, cardan, as, that, famous, physician, of, milan, a, great, enquirer, of, truth, but, too, greedy, a, receiver, of, it, he, hath, left, many, excellent, discourses, medical, natural, and, astrological, the, most, suspicious, are, those, two, he, wrote, by, admonition, in, a, dream, that, is, de, subtilitate, varietate, rerum, assuredly, this, learned, man, hath, taken, many, things, upon, trust, and, although, examined, some, hath, let, slip, many, others, he, is, of, singular, use, unto, a, prudent, reader, but, unto, him, that, only, desireth, hoties, or, to, replenish, his, head, with, varieties, like, many, others, before, related, either, in, the, original, or, confirmation, he, may, become, no, small, occasion, of, error, richard, hinckley, allen, tells, of, an, amusing, reference, made, by, samuel, butler, in, his, book, hudibras, cardan, believ, d, great, states, depend, upon,

bears, have, no, tails, alessandro, manzoni, s, novel, i, promessi, sposi, portrays, a, pedantic, scholar, of, the, obsolete, don, ferrante, as, a, great, admirer, of, cardano, significantly, he, values, him, only, for, his, superstitious, and, astrological, writings, his, scientific, writings, are, dismissed, because, they, contradict, aristotle, but, excused, on, the, ground, that, the, author, of, the, astrological, works, deserves, to, be, listened, to, even, when, he, is, wrong, english, novelist, e, m, forster, s, abinger, harvest, a, 1936, volume, of, essays, authorial, reviews, and, a, play, provides, a, sympathetic, treatment, of, cardano, in, the, section, titled, the, past, forster, believes, cardano, was, so, absorbed, in, self, analysis, that, he, often, forgot, to, repent, of, his, bad, temper, his, stupidity, his, licentiousness, and, love, of, revenge, 212, a, chronological, key, to, this, edition, is, supplied, by, m, fierz
