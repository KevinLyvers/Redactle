theodosius, i, greek, theodosios, 11, january, 347, 17, january, 395, also, called, theodosius, the, great, was, a, roman, emperor, from, 379, to, 395, he, won, two, civil, wars, and, was, instrumental, in, establishing, the, nicene, creed, as, the, orthodox, doctrine, for, nicene, christianity, theodosius, was, the, last, emperor, to, rule, the, entire, roman, empire, before, its, administration, was, permanently, split, between, the, western, roman, empire, and, the, eastern, roman, empire, he, successfully, ended, the, gothic, war, 376, 382, with, terms, advantageous, to, the, empire, with, the, goths, remaining, in, roman, territory, but, as, subject, allies, born, in, hispania, theodosius, was, the, son, of, a, high, ranking, general, of, the, same, name, count, theodosius, under, whose, guidance, he, rose, through, the, ranks, of, the, roman, army, theodosius, held, independent, command, in, moesia, in, 374, where, he, had, some, success, against, the, invading, sarmatians, not, long, afterwards, he, was, forced, into, retirement, and, his, father, was, executed, under, obscure, circumstances, theodosius, soon, regained, his, position, following, a, series, of, intrigues, and, executions, at, emperor, gratian, s, court, in, 379, after, the, eastern, roman, emperor, valens, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, against, the, goths, gratian, appointed, theodosius, as, a, successor, with, orders, to, take, charge, of, the, military, emergency, the, new, emperor, s, resources, and, depleted, armies, were, not, sufficient, to, drive, the, invaders, out, in, 382, the, goths, were, allowed, to, settle, south, of, the, danube, as, autonomous, allies, of, the, empire, in, 386, theodosius, signed, a, treaty, with, the, sasanian, empire, which, partitioned, the, long, disputed, kingdom, of, armenia, and, secured, a, durable, peace, between, the, two, powers, theodosius, was, a, strong, adherent, of, the, christian, doctrine, of, consubstantiality, and, an, opponent, of, arianism, he, convened, a, council, of, bishops, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, which, confirmed, the, former, as, orthodoxy, and, the, latter, as, a, heresy, although, theodosius, interfered, little, in, the, functioning, of, traditional, pagan, cults, and, appointed, non, christians, to, high, offices, he, failed, to, prevent, or, punish, the, damaging, of, several, hellenistic, temples, of, classical, antiquity, such, as, the, serapeum, of, alexandria, by, christian, zealots, during, his, earlier, reign, theodosius, ruled, the, eastern, provinces, while, the, west, was, overseen, by, the, emperors, gratian, and, valentinian, ii, whose, sister, he, married, theodosius, sponsored, several, measures, to, improve, his, capital, and, main, residence, constantinople, most, notably, his, expansion, of, the, forum, tauri, which, became, the, biggest, public, square, known, in, antiquity, theodosius, marched, west, twice, in, 388, and, 394, after, both, gratian, and, valentinian, had, been, killed, to, defeat, the, two, pretenders, magnus, maximus, and, eugenius, who, rose, to, replace, them, theodosius, s, final, victory, in, september, 394, made, him, master, of, the, entire, empire, he, died, a, few, months, later, and, was, succeeded, by, his, two, sons, arcadius, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, and, honorius, in, the, west, theodosius, was, said, to, have, been, a, diligent, administrator, austere, in, his, habits, merciful, and, a, devout, christian, for, centuries, after, his, death, theodosius, was, regarded, as, a, champion, of, christian, orthodoxy, who, decisively, stamped, out, paganism, modern, scholars, tend, to, see, this, as, an, interpretation, of, history, by, christian, writers, more, than, an, accurate, representation, of, actual, history, he, is, fairly, credited, with, presiding, over, a, revival, in, classical, art, that, some, historians, have, termed, a, theodosian, renaissance, although, his, pacification, of, the, goths, secured, peace, for, the, empire, during, his, lifetime, their, status, as, an, autonomous, entity, within, roman, borders, caused, problems, for, succeeding, emperors, theodosius, has, also, received, criticism, for, defending, his, own, dynastic, interests, at, the, cost, of, two, civil, wars, his, two, sons, proved, weak, and, incapable, rulers, and, they, presided, over, a, period, of, foreign, invasions, and, court, intrigues, which, heavily, weakened, the, empire, the, descendants, of, theodosius, ruled, the, roman, world, for, the, next, six, decades, and, the, east, west, division, endured, until, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, late, 5th, century, theodosius, was, born, in, hispania, on, 11, january, probably, in, the, year, 347, his, father, of, the, same, name, count, theodosius, was, a, successful, and, high, ranking, general, magister, equitum, under, the, western, roman, emperor, valentinian, i, and, his, mother, was, called, thermantia, the, family, appear, to, have, been, minor, landed, aristocrats, in, hispania, although, it, is, not, clear, if, this, social, status, went, back, several, generations, or, if, theodosius, the, elder, was, simply, awarded, land, there, for, his, military, service, their, roots, to, hispania, were, nevertheless, probably, long, standing, since, various, relatives, of, the, future, emperor, theodosius, are, likewise, attested, as, being, from, there, and, theodosius, himself, was, ubiquitously, associated, in, the, ancient, literary, sources, and, panegyrics, with, the, image, of, fellow, spanish, born, emperor, trajan, though, he, never, again, visited, the, peninsula, after, becoming, emperor, very, little, is, recorded, of, the, upbringing, of, theodosius, the, 5th, century, author, theodoret, claimed, the, future, emperor, grew, up, and, was, educated, in, his, iberian, homeland, but, his, testimony, is, unreliable, one, modern, historian, instead, thinks, theodosius, must, have, grown, up, among, the, army, participating, in, his, father, s, campaigns, throughout, the, provinces, as, was, customary, at, the, time, for, families, with, a, tradition, of, military, service, one, source, says, he, received, a, decent, education, and, developed, a, particular, interest, in, history, which, theodosius, then, valued, as, a, guide, to, his, own, conduct, throughout, life, theodosius, is, first, attested, accompanying, his, father, to, britain, on, his, expedition, in, 368, 369, to, suppress, the, great, conspiracy, a, concerted, celtic, and, germanic, invasion, of, the, island, provinces, after, probably, serving, in, his, father, s, staff, on, further, campaigns, theodosius, received, his, first, independent, command, by, 374, when, he, was, appointed, the, dux, commanding, officer, of, the, province, of, moesia, prima, in, the, danube, in, the, autumn, of, 374, he, successfully, repulsed, an, incursion, of, sarmatians, on, his, sector, of, the, frontier, and, forced, them, into, submission, not, long, afterwards, however, under, mysterious, circumstances, theodosius, s, father, suddenly, fell, from, imperial, favor, and, was, executed, and, the, future, emperor, felt, compelled, to, retire, to, his, estates, in, hispania, although, these, events, are, poorly, documented, historians, usually, attribute, this, fall, from, grace, to, the, machinations, of, a, court, faction, led, by, maximinus, a, senior, civilian, official, according, to, another, theory, the, future, emperor, theodosius, lost, his, father, his, military, post, or, both, in, the, purges, of, high, officials, that, resulted, from, the, accession, of, the, 4, year, old, emperor, valentinian, ii, in, november, 375, theodosius, s, period, away, from, service, in, hispania, during, which, he, was, said, to, have, received, threats, from, those, responsible, for, his, father, s, death, did, not, last, long, however, as, maximinus, the, probable, culprit, was, himself, removed, from, power, around, april, 376, and, then, executed, the, emperor, gratian, immediately, began, replacing, maximinus, and, his, associates, with, relatives, of, theodosius, in, key, government, positions, indicating, the, family, s, full, rehabilitation, and, by, 377, theodosius, himself, had, regained, his, command, against, the, sarmatians, theodosius, s, renewed, term, of, office, seems, to, have, gone, uneventfully, until, news, arrived, that, the, eastern, roman, emperor, valens, had, been, killed, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, august, 378, against, invading, goths, the, disastrous, defeat, left, much, of, rome, s, military, leadership, dead, discredited, or, barbarian, in, origin, to, the, result, that, theodosius, notwithstanding, his, own, modest, record, became, the, establishment, s, choice, to, replace, valens, and, assume, control, of, the, crisis, with, the, begrudging, consent, of, the, western, emperor, gratian, theodosius, was, formally, invested, with, the, purple, by, a, council, of, officials, at, sirmium, on, 19, january, 379, the, immediate, problem, facing, theodosius, upon, his, accession, was, how, to, check, the, bands, of, goths, that, were, laying, waste, to, the, balkans, with, an, army, that, had, been, severely, depleted, of, manpower, following, the, debacle, at, adrianople, the, western, emperor, gratian, who, seems, to, have, provided, only, little, immediate, assistance, surrendered, to, theodosius, control, of, the, praetorian, prefecture, of, illyricum, for, the, duration, of, the, conflict, giving, his, new, colleague, full, charge, the, war, effort, theodosius, implemented, stern, and, desperate, recruiting, measures, resorting, to, the, conscription, of, farmers, and, miners, punishments, were, instituted, for, harboring, deserters, and, furnishing, unfit, recruits, and, even, self, mutilation, did, not, exempt, men, from, service, theodosius, also, admitted, large, numbers, of, non, roman, auxiliaries, into, the, army, even, gothic, deserters, from, beyond, the, danube, some, of, these, foreign, recruits, were, exchanged, with, more, reliable, roman, garrison, troops, stationed, in, egypt, in, the, second, half, of, 379, theodosius, and, his, generals, based, at, thessalonica, won, some, minor, victories, over, individual, bands, of, raiders, however, they, suffered, at, least, one, serious, defeat, in, 380, which, was, blamed, on, the, treachery, of, the, new, barbarian, recruits, during, the, autumn, of, 380, a, life, threatening, illness, from, which, theodosius, recovered, prompted, him, to, request, baptism, some, obscure, victories, were, recorded, in, official, sources, around, this, time, however, and, in, november, 380, the, military, situation, was, found, to, be, sufficiently, stable, for, theodosius, to, move, his, court, to, constantinople, there, the, emperor, enjoyed, a, propaganda, victory, when, in, january, 381, he, received, the, visit, and, submission, of, a, minor, gothic, leader, athanaric, by, this, point, however, theodosius, seems, to, have, no, longer, believed, that, the, goths, could, be, completely, ejected, from, roman, territory, after, athanaric, died, that, very, same, month, the, emperor, gave, him, a, funeral, with, full, honors, impressing, his, entourage, and, signaling, to, the, enemy, that, the, empire, was, disposed, to, negotiate, terms, during, the, campaigning, season, of, 381, reinforcements, from, gratian, drove, the, goths, out, of, the, diocese, of, macedonia, and, thessaly, into, the, diocese, of, thrace, while, in, the, latter, sector, theodosius, or, one, of, his, generals, repulsed, an, incursion, by, a, group, of, sciri, and, huns, across, the, danube, following, negotiations, which, likely, lasted, at, least, several, months, the, romans, and, goths, finally, concluded, a, settlement, on, 3, october, 382, in, return, for, military, service, to, rome, the, goths, were, allowed, to, settle, some, tracts, of, roman, land, south, of, the, danube, the, terms, were, unusually, favorable, to, the, goths, reflecting, the, fact, that, they, were, entrenched, in, roman, territory, and, had, not, been, driven, out, namely, instead, of, fully, submitting, to, roman, authority, they, were, allowed, to, remain, autonomous, under, their, own, leaders, and, thus, remaining, a, strong, unified, body, the, goths, now, settled, within, the, empire, would, largely, fight, for, the, romans, as, a, national, contingent, as, opposed, to, being, fully, integrated, into, the, roman, forces, according, to, the, chronicon, paschale, theodosius, celebrated, his, quinquennalia, on, 19, january, 383, at, constantinople, on, this, occasion, he, raised, his, eldest, son, arcadius, to, co, emperor, augustus, sometime, in, 383, gratian, s, wife, constantia, died, gratian, remarried, wedding, laeta, whose, father, was, a, consularis, of, roman, syria, early, 383, saw, the, acclamation, of, magnus, maximus, as, emperor, in, britain, and, the, appointment, of, themistius, as, praefectus, urbi, in, constantinople, on, 25, august, 383, according, to, the, consularia, constantinopolitana, gratian, was, killed, at, lugdunum, lyon, by, andragathius, the, magister, equitum, of, the, rebel, emperor, during, the, rebellion, of, magnus, maximus, constantia, s, body, arrived, in, constantinople, on, 12, september, that, year, and, was, buried, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, on, 1, december, gratian, was, deified, as, latin, divus, gratianus, lit, the, divine, gratian, theodosius, unable, to, do, much, about, maximus, due, to, ongoing, military, inadequacy, opened, negotiations, with, the, persian, emperor, shapur, iii, r, 383, 388, of, the, sasanian, empire, according, to, the, consularia, constantinopolitana, theodosius, received, in, constantinople, an, embassy, from, them, in, 384, in, an, attempt, to, curb, maximus, s, ambitions, theodosius, appointed, flavius, neoterius, as, the, praetorian, prefect, of, italy, in, the, summer, of, 384, theodosius, met, his, co, emperor, valentinian, ii, in, northern, italy, theodosius, brokered, a, peace, agreement, between, valentinian, and, magnus, maximus, which, endured, for, several, years, theodosius, i, was, based, in, constantinople, and, according, to, peter, heather, wanted, for, his, own, dynastic, reasons, for, his, two, sons, each, eventually, to, inherit, half, of, the, empire, refused, to, appoint, a, recognized, counterpart, in, the, west, as, a, result, he, was, faced, with, rumbling, discontent, there, as, well, as, dangerous, usurpers, who, found, plentiful, support, among, the, bureaucrats, and, military, officers, who, felt, they, were, not, getting, a, fair, share, of, the, imperial, cake, theodosius, s, second, son, honorius, was, born, on, 9, december, 384, and, titled, nobilissimus, puer, or, nobilissimus, iuvenis, the, death, of, aelia, flaccilla, theodosius, s, first, wife, and, the, mother, of, arcadius, honorius, and, pulcheria, occurred, by, 386, she, died, at, scotumis, in, thrace, and, was, buried, at, constantinople, her, funeral, oration, delivered, by, gregory, of, nyssa, a, statue, of, her, was, dedicated, in, the, byzantine, senate, in, 384, or, 385, theodosius, s, niece, serena, was, married, to, the, magister, militum, stilicho, in, the, beginning, of, 386, theodosius, s, daughter, pulcheria, also, died, that, summer, more, goths, were, defeated, and, many, were, settled, in, phrygia, according, to, the, consularia, constantinopolitana, a, roman, triumph, over, the, gothic, greuthungi, was, then, celebrated, at, constantinople, the, same, year, work, began, on, the, great, triumphal, column, in, the, forum, of, theodosius, in, constantinople, the, column, of, theodosius, the, consularia, constantinopolitana, records, that, on, 19, january, 387, arcadius, celebrated, his, quinquennalia, in, constantinople, by, the, end, of, the, month, there, was, an, uprising, or, riot, in, antioch, modern, antakya, the, roman, persian, wars, concluded, with, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, acilisene, with, persia, by, the, terms, of, the, agreement, the, ancient, kingdom, of, armenia, was, divided, between, the, powers, by, the, end, of, the, 380s, theodosius, and, the, court, were, in, milan, and, northern, italy, had, settled, down, to, a, period, of, prosperity, peter, brown, says, gold, was, being, made, in, milan, by, those, who, owned, land, as, well, as, by, those, who, came, with, the, court, for, government, service, great, landowners, took, advantage, of, the, court, s, need, for, food, turning, agrarian, produce, into, gold, while, repressing, and, misusing, the, poor, who, grew, it, and, brought, it, in, according, to, brown, modern, scholars, link, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, to, the, avarice, of, the, rich, of, this, era, he, quotes, paulinus, of, milan, as, describing, these, men, as, creating, a, court, where, everything, was, up, for, sale, in, the, late, 380s, ambrose, the, bishop, of, milan, took, the, lead, in, opposing, this, presenting, the, need, for, the, rich, to, care, for, the, poor, as, a, necessary, consequence, of, the, unity, of, all, christians, this, led, to, a, major, development, in, the, political, culture, of, the, day, called, the, advocacy, revolution, of, the, later, roman, empire, this, revolution, had, been, fostered, by, the, imperial, government, and, it, encouraged, appeals, and, denunciations, of, bad, government, from, below, however, brown, adds, that, in, the, crucial, area, of, taxation, and, the, treatment, of, fiscal, debtors, the, late, roman, state, remained, impervious, to, christianity, the, peace, with, magnus, maximus, was, broken, in, 387, and, valentinian, escaped, to, the, east, with, justina, reaching, thessalonica, thessaloniki, in, summer, or, autumn, 387, and, appealing, to, theodosius, for, aid, valentinian, ii, s, sister, galla, was, then, married, to, the, eastern, emperor, at, thessalonica, in, late, autumn, theodosius, may, still, have, been, in, thessalonica, when, he, celebrated, his, decennalia, on, 19, january, 388, theodosius, was, consul, for, the, second, time, in, 388, galla, and, theodosius, s, first, child, a, son, named, gratian, was, born, in, 388, or, 389, in, summer, 388, theodosius, recovered, italy, from, magnus, maximus, for, valentinian, and, in, june, the, meeting, of, christians, deemed, heretics, was, banned, by, valentinian, the, armies, of, theodosius, and, maximus, fought, at, the, battle, of, poetovio, in, 388, which, saw, maximus, defeated, on, 28, august, 388, maximus, was, executed, now, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, western, empire, as, well, theodosius, celebrated, his, victory, in, rome, on, 13, june, 389, and, stayed, in, milan, until, 391, installing, his, own, loyalists, in, senior, positions, including, the, new, magister, militum, of, the, west, the, frankish, general, arbogast, according, to, the, consularia, constantinopolitana, arbogast, killed, flavius, victor, r, 384, 388, magnus, maximus, s, young, son, and, co, emperor, in, gaul, in, august, september, that, year, damnatio, memoriae, was, pronounced, against, them, and, inscriptions, naming, them, were, erased, the, massacre, of, thessalonica, thessaloniki, in, greece, was, a, massacre, of, local, civilians, by, roman, troops, the, best, estimate, of, the, date, is, april, of, 390, fn, 1, 215, the, massacre, was, most, likely, a, response, to, an, urban, riot, that, led, to, the, murder, of, a, roman, official, what, most, scholars, such, as, philosopher, stanislav, dole, al, see, as, the, most, reliable, of, the, sources, is, the, historia, ecclesiastica, written, by, sozomen, about, 442, in, it, sozomen, supplies, the, identity, of, the, murdered, roman, official, as, butheric, the, commanding, general, of, the, field, army, in, illyricum, magister, militum, per, illyricum, 91, according, to, sozomen, a, popular, charioteer, tried, to, rape, a, cup, bearer, or, possibly, butheric, himself, and, in, response, butheric, arrested, and, jailed, the, charioteer, 93, 94, the, populace, demanded, the, chariot, racer, s, release, and, when, butheric, refused, a, general, revolt, rose, up, costing, butheric, his, life, 216, 217, dole, al, says, the, name, butheric, indicates, he, might, have, been, a, goth, and, that, the, general, s, ethnicity, could, have, been, a, factor, in, the, riot, but, none, of, the, early, sources, actually, say, so, 92, 96, there, are, no, contemporaneous, accounts, church, historians, sozomen, theodoret, the, bishop, of, cyrrhus, socrates, of, constantinople, and, rufinus, wrote, the, earliest, accounts, during, the, fifth, century, these, are, moral, accounts, emphasizing, imperial, piety, and, ecclesial, action, rather, than, historical, and, political, details, 215, 218, further, difficulty, is, created, by, these, events, moving, into, legend, in, art, and, literature, almost, immediately, 251, dole, al, explains, that, yet, another, problem, is, created, by, aspects, of, these, accounts, contradicting, one, another, to, the, point, of, being, mutually, exclusive, 216, nonetheless, most, classicists, accept, at, least, the, basic, account, of, the, massacre, although, they, continue, to, dispute, when, it, happened, who, was, responsible, for, it, what, motivated, it, and, what, impact, it, had, on, subsequent, events, theodosius, was, not, in, thessalonica, when, the, massacre, occurred, the, court, was, in, milan, 223, several, scholars, such, as, historian, g, w, bowersock, and, authors, stephen, williams, and, gerard, friell, think, that, theodosius, ordered, the, massacre, in, an, excess, of, volcanic, anger, mclynn, also, puts, all, the, blame, on, the, emperor, 103, as, does, the, less, dependable, fifth, century, historian, theodoret, other, scholars, such, as, historians, mark, hebblewhite, and, n, q, king, do, not, agree, peter, brown, points, to, the, empire, s, established, process, of, decision, making, which, required, the, emperor, to, listen, to, his, ministers, before, acting, 111, there, is, some, indication, in, the, sources, theodosius, did, listen, to, his, counselors, but, received, bad, or, misleading, advice, 95, 98, j, f, matthews, argues, that, the, emperor, first, tried, to, punish, the, city, by, selective, executions, peter, brown, concurs, as, it, was, what, was, probably, planned, as, a, selective, killing, got, out, of, hand, 110, dole, al, says, sozomen, is, very, specific, in, saying, that, in, response, to, the, riot, the, soldiers, made, random, arrests, in, the, hippodrome, to, perform, a, few, public, executions, as, a, demonstration, of, imperial, disfavor, but, the, citizenry, objected, dole, al, suggests, the, soldiers, realizing, that, they, were, surrounded, by, angry, citizens, perhaps, panicked, and, forcibly, cleared, the, hippodrome, at, the, cost, of, several, thousands, of, lives, of, local, inhabitants, 103, 104, mclynn, says, theodosius, was, unable, to, impose, discipline, upon, the, faraway, troops, and, covered, that, failure, by, taking, responsibility, for, the, massacre, on, himself, declaring, he, had, given, the, order, then, countermanded, it, too, late, to, stop, it, 102, 104, ambrose, the, bishop, of, milan, and, one, of, theodosius, s, many, counselors, was, away, from, court, after, being, informed, of, events, concerning, thessalonica, he, wrote, theodosius, a, letter, offering, what, mclynn, calls, a, different, way, for, the, emperor, to, save, face, and, restore, his, public, image, 262, ambrose, urges, a, semi, public, demonstration, of, penitence, telling, the, emperor, he, will, not, give, theodosius, communion, until, this, is, done, wolf, liebeschuetz, says, theodosius, duly, complied, and, came, to, church, without, his, imperial, robes, until, christmas, when, ambrose, openly, admitted, him, to, communion, 262, 263, washburn, says, the, image, of, the, mitered, prelate, braced, in, the, door, of, the, cathedral, in, milan, blocking, theodosius, from, entering, is, a, product, of, the, imagination, of, theodoret, who, wrote, of, the, events, of, 390, using, his, own, ideology, to, fill, the, gaps, in, the, historical, record, 215, peter, brown, also, says, there, was, no, dramatic, encounter, at, the, church, door, 111, mclynn, states, that, the, encounter, at, the, church, door, has, long, been, known, as, a, pious, fiction, wolfe, liebeschuetz, says, ambrose, advocated, a, course, of, action, which, avoided, the, kind, of, public, humiliation, theodoret, describes, and, that, is, the, course, theodosius, chose, 262, according, to, the, early, twentieth, century, historian, henry, smith, williams, history, s, assessment, of, theodosius, s, character, has, been, stained, by, the, massacre, of, thessalonica, for, centuries, williams, describes, theodosius, as, a, virtuous, minded, courageous, man, who, was, vigorous, in, pursuit, of, any, important, goal, but, through, contrasting, the, inhuman, massacre, of, the, people, of, thessalonica, with, the, generous, pardon, of, the, citizens, of, antioch, after, civil, war, williams, also, concludes, theodosius, was, hasty, and, choleric, it, is, only, modern, scholarship, that, has, begun, disputing, theodosius, s, responsibility, for, those, events, from, the, time, edward, gibbon, wrote, his, rise, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, ambrose, s, action, after, the, fact, has, been, cited, as, an, example, of, the, church, s, dominance, over, the, state, in, antiquity, alan, cameron, says, the, assumption, is, so, widespread, it, would, be, superfluous, to, cite, authorities, but, there, is, not, a, shred, of, evidence, for, ambrose, exerting, any, such, influence, over, theodosius, brown, says, ambrose, was, just, one, among, many, advisors, and, cameron, says, there, is, no, evidence, theodosius, favored, him, above, anyone, else, by, the, time, of, the, thessalonian, affair, ambrose, an, aristocrat, and, former, governor, had, been, a, bishop, for, 16, years, and, during, his, episcopate, had, seen, the, death, of, three, emperors, before, theodosius, these, produced, significant, political, storms, yet, ambrose, held, his, place, using, what, mclynn, calls, his, considerable, qualities, considerable, luck, to, survive, theodosius, was, in, his, 40s, had, been, emperor, for, 11, years, had, temporarily, settled, the, gothic, wars, and, won, a, civil, war, as, a, latin, speaking, nicene, western, leader, of, the, greek, largely, arian, east, boniface, ramsey, says, he, had, already, left, an, indelible, mark, on, history, 12, mclynn, asserts, that, the, relationship, between, theodosius, and, ambrose, transformed, into, myth, within, a, generation, of, their, deaths, he, also, observes, that, the, documents, revealing, the, relationship, between, these, two, formidable, men, do, not, show, the, personal, friendship, the, legends, portray, instead, those, documents, read, more, as, negotiations, between, the, institutions, the, men, represent, the, roman, state, and, the, italian, church, in, 391, theodosius, left, his, trusted, general, arbogast, who, had, served, in, the, balkans, after, adrianople, to, be, magister, militum, for, the, western, emperor, valentinian, ii, while, theodosius, attempted, to, rule, the, entire, empire, from, constantinople, on, 15, may, 392, valentinian, ii, died, at, vienna, in, gaul, vienne, either, by, suicide, or, as, part, of, a, plot, by, arbogast, valentinian, had, quarrelled, publicly, with, arbogast, and, was, found, hanged, in, his, room, arbogast, announced, that, this, had, been, a, suicide, stephen, williams, asserts, that, valentinian, s, death, left, arbogast, in, an, untenable, position, he, had, to, carry, on, governing, without, the, ability, to, issue, edicts, and, rescripts, from, a, legitimate, acclaimed, emperor, arbogast, was, unable, to, assume, the, role, of, emperor, himself, because, of, his, non, roman, background, instead, on, 22, august, 392, arbogast, had, valentinian, s, master, of, correspondence, eugenius, proclaimed, emperor, in, the, west, at, lugdunum, at, least, two, embassies, went, to, theodosius, to, explain, events, one, of, them, christian, in, make, up, but, they, received, ambivalent, replies, and, were, sent, home, without, achieving, their, goals, theodosius, raised, his, second, son, honorius, to, emperor, on, 23, january, 393, implying, the, illegality, of, eugenius, s, rule, williams, and, friell, say, that, by, the, spring, of, 393, the, split, was, complete, and, in, april, arbogast, and, eugenius, at, last, moved, into, italy, without, resistance, flavianus, the, praetorian, prefect, of, italy, whom, theodosius, had, appointed, defected, to, their, side, through, early, 394, both, sides, prepared, for, war, theodosius, gathered, a, large, army, including, the, goths, whom, he, had, settled, in, the, eastern, empire, as, foederati, and, caucasian, and, saracen, auxiliaries, and, marched, against, eugenius, the, battle, began, on, 5, september, 394, with, theodosius, s, full, frontal, assault, on, eugenius, s, forces, thousands, of, goths, died, and, in, theodosius, s, camp, the, loss, of, the, day, decreased, morale, it, is, said, by, theodoret, that, theodosius, was, visited, by, two, heavenly, riders, all, in, white, who, gave, him, courage, the, next, day, the, extremely, bloody, battle, began, again, and, theodosius, s, forces, were, aided, by, a, natural, phenomenon, known, as, the, bora, which, can, produce, hurricane, strength, winds, the, bora, blew, directly, against, the, forces, of, eugenius, and, disrupted, the, line, eugenius, s, camp, was, stormed, eugenius, was, captured, and, soon, after, executed, according, to, socrates, scholasticus, theodosius, defeated, eugenius, at, the, battle, of, the, frigidus, the, vipava, on, 6, september, 394, on, 8, september, arbogast, killed, himself, according, to, socrates, on, 1, january, 395, honorius, arrived, in, mediolanum, and, a, victory, celebration, was, held, there, zosimus, records, that, at, the, end, of, april, 394, theodosius, s, wife, galla, had, died, while, he, was, away, at, war, a, number, of, christian, sources, report, that, eugenius, cultivated, the, support, of, the, pagan, senators, by, promising, to, restore, the, altar, of, victory, and, provide, public, funds, for, the, maintenance, of, cults, if, they, would, support, him, and, if, he, won, the, coming, war, against, theodosius, cameron, notes, that, the, ultimate, source, for, this, is, ambrose, s, biographer, paulinus, the, deacon, whom, he, argues, fabricated, the, entire, narrative, and, deserves, no, credence, historian, michele, renee, salzman, explains, that, two, newly, relevant, texts, john, chrysostom, s, homily, 6, adversus, catharos, pg, 63, 491, 492, and, the, consultationes, zacchei, et, apollonii, re, dated, to, the, 390s, reinforces, the, view, that, religion, was, not, the, key, ideological, element, in, the, events, at, the, time, according, to, maijastina, kahlos, finnish, historian, and, docent, of, latin, language, and, roman, literature, at, the, university, of, helsinki, the, notion, of, pagan, aristocrats, united, in, a, heroic, and, cultured, resistance, who, rose, up, against, the, ruthless, advance, of, christianity, in, a, final, battle, near, frigidus, in, 394, is, a, romantic, myth, theodosius, suffered, from, a, disease, involving, severe, edema, he, died, in, mediolanum, milan, on, 17, january, 395, and, his, body, lay, in, state, in, the, palace, there, for, forty, days, his, funeral, was, held, in, the, cathedral, on, 25, february, bishop, ambrose, delivered, a, panegyric, titled, de, obitu, theodosii, in, the, presence, of, stilicho, and, honorius, in, which, ambrose, praised, the, suppression, of, paganism, by, theodosius, on, 8, november, 395, his, body, was, transferred, to, constantinople, where, according, to, the, chronicon, paschale, he, was, buried, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, he, was, honored, as, divus, theodosius, lit, the, divine, theodosius, he, was, interred, in, a, porphyry, sarcophagus, that, was, described, in, the, 10th, century, by, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, in, his, work, de, ceremoniis, theodosius, was, initially, styled, the, great, simply, as, a, way, to, differentiate, him, from, his, grandson, theodosius, ii, later, at, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, 451, the, honorific, was, deemed, merited, due, to, his, promotion, of, nicene, christianity, theodosius, the, great, is, venerated, in, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, emperor, king, theodosius, is, commemorated, in, armenian, anaphora, with, saint, kings, abgar, constantine, and, tiridates, in, eastern, orthodox, church, he, is, commemorated, as, ktetor, of, vatopedi, and, donator, of, vatopedi, icon, of, the, mother, of, god, according, to, art, historian, david, wright, art, of, the, era, around, the, year, 400, reflects, optimism, amongst, the, traditional, polytheists, 355, this, is, likely, connected, to, what, ine, jacobs, calls, a, renaissance, of, classical, styles, of, art, in, the, theodosian, period, ad, 379, 395, often, referred, to, in, modern, scholarship, as, the, theodosian, renaissance, the, forum, tauri, in, constantinople, was, renamed, and, redecorated, as, the, forum, of, theodosius, including, a, column, and, a, triumphal, arch, in, his, honour, 535, the, missorium, of, theodosius, the, city, of, aprodisias, s, statue, of, the, emperor, the, base, of, the, obelisk, of, theodosius, the, columns, of, theodosius, and, arcadius, and, the, diptych, of, probus, were, all, commissioned, by, the, court, and, reflect, a, similar, renaissance, of, classicism, 535, according, to, armin, wirsching, two, obelisks, were, shipped, by, the, romans, from, karnak, to, alexandria, in, 13, 12, bc, in, 357, constantius, ii, had, one, that, became, known, as, the, lateran, obelisk, shipped, to, rome, wirsching, says, the, romans, had, previously, watched, and, learned, from, the, egyptians, how, to, transport, such, large, heavy, objects, so, they, constructed, a, special, sea, going, version, of, the, nile, vessels, a, double, ship, with, three, hulls, in, 390, theodosius, oversaw, the, removal, of, the, other, to, constantinople, the, obelisk, with, its, sculpted, base, in, the, former, hippodrome, of, constantinople, is, well, known, as, a, rare, datable, work, of, late, antique, art, a, sixth, century, source, puts, the, raising, of, the, obelisk, in, the, year, 390, and, greek, and, latin, epigrams, on, the, plinth, the, lower, part, of, the, base, credit, theodosius, i, and, the, urban, prefect, proclus, with, this, feat, linda, safran, says, that, relocating, the, obelisk, was, motivated, by, theodosius, s, victory, over, the, tyrants, most, likely, maximus, magnus, and, his, son, victor, 410, it, is, now, known, as, the, obelisk, of, theodosius, and, still, stands, in, the, hippodrome, of, constantinople, the, long, roman, circus, that, was, at, one, time, the, centre, of, constantinople, s, public, life, re, erecting, the, monolith, was, a, challenge,

the, imperial, box, with, a, cover, over, them, as, a, mark, of, their, status, from, the, perspective, of, style, it, has, served, as, the, key, monument, in, identifying, a, so, called, theodosian, court, style, which, is, usually, described, as, a, renaissance, of, earlier, roman, classicism, 411, it, is, traditionally, stated, that, the, arian, controversy, a, dispute, concerning, the, nature, of, the, divine, trinity, and, its, accompanying, struggles, for, political, influence, started, in, alexandria, during, the, reign, of, constantine, the, great, between, a, presbyter, arius, of, alexandria, and, his, bishop, alexander, of, alexandria, however, many, of, the, issues, raised, by, the, controversy, were, under, lively, discussion, before, arius, and, alexander, publicly, clashed, the, views, of, arius, were, such, as, to, bring, into, unavoidable, prominence, a, doctrinal, crisis, which, had, gradually, been, gathering, he, was, the, spark, that, started, the, explosion, but, in, himself, he, was, of, no, great, significance, it, is, also, traditionally, stated, that, alexander, represented, orthodoxy, and, that, when, he, died, his, successor, athanasius, became, the, representative, of, orthodoxy, in, reality, nicene, apologists, turn, arianism, into, a, self, conscious, sect, as, if, the, boundaries, of, catholic, identity, were, firmly, and, clearly, drawn, in, advance, but, the, whole, history, of, arius, and, of, arianism, reminds, us, that, this, was, not, so, rw, 83, the, arian, controversy, is, not, the, story, of, a, defence, of, orthodoxy, but, of, a, search, for, orthodoxy, arius, asserted, that, god, the, father, created, the, son, this, meant, the, son, though, still, seen, as, divine, was, not, equal, to, the, father, because, he, had, a, beginning, and, was, not, eternal, the, controversy, had, spread, from, alexandria, into, almost, all, the, african, regions, and, was, considered, a, disturbance, of, the, public, order, by, the, roman, empire, eusebius, of, caesarea, in, the, life, of, constantine, constantine, had, tried, to, settle, the, issues, at, the, council, of, nicaea, but, as, arnold, hugh, martin, jones, states, the, rules, laid, down, at, nicaea, were, not, universally, accepted, after, the, nicene, creed, was, formulated, in, 325, many, in, the, church, reacted, strongly, against, the, word, homoousios, in, the, creed, and, therefore, councils, at, ariminum, rimini, nike, southeast, of, adrianople, and, constantinople, held, in, 359, 60, by, emperor, constantius, ii, formulated, creeds, that, were, intended, to, replace, or, revise, the, nicene, creed, in, particular, to, find, alternatives, for, homoousios, these, councils, are, no, longer, regarded, as, ecumenical, councils, in, the, tradition, of, the, church, their, creeds, which, are, at, odds, with, the, nicene, creed, are, known, as, arian, creeds, during, this, time, athanasius, was, at, the, center, of, the, controversy, and, became, the, champion, of, orthodoxy, after, alexander, died, 28, 29, 31, to, athanasius, arius, s, interpretation, of, jesus, s, nature, homoiousian, that, the, father, and, son, are, similar, but, not, identical, in, substance, could, not, explain, how, jesus, could, accomplish, the, redemption, of, humankind, which, is, the, foundational, principle, of, christianity, according, to, athanasius, god, had, to, become, human, so, that, humans, could, become, divin, that, led, him, to, conclude, that, the, divine, nature, in, jesus, was, identical, to, that, of, the, father, and, that, father, and, son, have, the, same, substance, homoousios, athanasius, s, teaching, was, a, major, influence, in, the, west, especially, on, theodosius, i, 20, on, 28, february, 380, theodosius, issued, the, edict, of, thessalonica, a, decree, addressed, to, the, city, of, constantinople, determining, that, only, christians, who, believed, in, the, consubstantiality, of, god, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, could, style, themselves, catholic, and, have, their, own, places, of, worship, officially, recognized, as, churches, deviants, were, labeled, heretics, and, described, as, out, of, their, minds, and, insane, recent, scholarship, has, tended, to, reject, former, views, that, the, edict, was, a, key, step, in, establishing, christianity, as, the, official, religion, of, the, empire, since, it, was, aimed, exclusively, at, constantinople, and, seems, to, have, gone, largely, unnoticed, by, contemporaries, outside, the, capital, for, example, german, ancient, historian, karl, leo, noethlichs, writes, that, the, edict, of, thessalonica, was, neither, anti, pagan, nor, antisemitic, it, did, not, declare, christianity, to, be, the, official, religion, of, the, empire, and, it, gave, no, advantage, to, christians, over, other, faiths, it, is, clear, from, mandates, issued, in, the, years, after, 380, that, theodosius, had, made, no, requirement, for, pagans, or, jews, to, convert, to, christianity, nonetheless, the, edict, is, the, first, known, secular, roman, law, to, positively, define, a, religious, orthodoxy, according, to, robinson, thornton, theodosius, began, taking, steps, to, repress, arianism, immediately, after, his, baptism, in, 380, 39, on, 26, november, 380, two, days, after, he, had, arrived, in, constantinople, theodosius, expelled, the, homoian, bishop, demophilus, of, constantinople, and, appointed, meletius, patriarch, of, antioch, and, gregory, of, nazianzus, one, of, the, cappadocian, fathers, from, cappadocia, today, in, turkey, patriarch, of, constantinople, theodosius, had, just, been, baptized, by, bishop, ascholius, of, thessalonica, during, a, severe, illness, in, may, 381, theodosius, summoned, a, new, ecumenical, council, at, constantinople, to, repair, the, schism, between, east, and, west, on, the, basis, of, nicene, orthodoxy, the, council, went, on, to, define, orthodoxy, including, the, third, person, of, the, trinity, the, holy, spirit, as, equal, to, the, father, and, proceeding, from, him, the, council, also, condemned, the, apollonarian, and, macedonian, heresies, clarified, jurisdictions, of, the, bishops, according, to, the, civil, boundaries, of, dioceses, and, ruled, that, constantinople, was, second, in, precedence, to, rome, theodosius, seems, to, have, adopted, a, cautious, policy, toward, traditional, non, christian, cults, reiterating, his, christian, predecessors, bans, on, animal, sacrifice, divination, and, apostasy, while, allowing, other, pagan, practices, to, be, performed, publicly, and, temples, to, remain, open, he, also, voiced, his, support, for, the, preservation, of, temple, buildings, but, nonetheless, failed, to, prevent, the, damaging, of, many, holy, sites, images, and, objects, of, piety, by, christian, zealots, some, including, even, his, own, officials, theodosius, also, turned, pagan, holidays, into, workdays, but, the, festivals, associated, with, them, continued, a, number, of, laws, against, paganism, were, issued, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, in, 391, and, 392, but, historians, have, tended, to, downplay, their, practical, effects, and, even, the, emperor, s, direct, role, in, them, modern, scholars, think, there, is, little, if, any, evidence, theodosius, pursued, an, active, and, sustained, policy, against, the, traditional, cults, there, is, evidence, that, theodosius, took, care, to, prevent, the, empire, s, still, substantial, pagan, population, from, feeling, ill, disposed, toward, his, rule, following, the, death, in, 388, of, his, praetorian, prefect, cynegius, who, had, vandalized, a, number, of, pagan, shrines, in, the, eastern, provinces, theodosius, replaced, him, with, a, moderate, pagan, who, subsequently, moved, to, protect, the, temples, 53, during, his, first, official, tour, of, italy, 389, 391, the, emperor, won, over, the, influential, pagan, lobby, in, the, roman, senate, by, appointing, its, foremost, members, to, important, administrative, posts, theodosius, also, nominated, the, last, pair, of, pagan, consuls, in, roman, history, tatianus, and, symmachus, in, 391, contemporary, archaeology, has, found, that, the, area, with, the, most, destruction, against, temples, by, christians, took, place, in, the, territory, around, constantinople, in, the, diocese, of, orientis, the, east, under, theodosius, s, prefect, maternus, cynegius, where, archaeological, digs, have, discovered, several, destroyed, temples, theodosius, officially, supported, temple, preservation, but, garth, fowden, says, cynegius, did, not, limit, himself, to, theodosius, s, official, policy, but, instead, commissioned, temple, destruction, on, a, wide, scale, even, employing, the, military, under, his, command, for, this, purpose, 63, christopher, haas, also, says, cynegius, oversaw, temple, closings, the, prohibition, of, sacrifices, and, the, destruction, of, temples, in, osrhoene, carrhae, and, beroea, 160, 162, earlier, scholars, believed, cynegius, s, actions, were, just, part, of, a, tide, of, violence, against, temples, that, continued, throughout, the, 390s, 114, 47, however, recent, archaeological, discoveries, have, undermined, this, view, the, archaeological, evidence, for, the, violent, destruction, of, temples, in, the, fourth, and, early, fifth, centuries, around, the, entire, mediterranean, is, limited, to, a, handful, of, sites, temple, destruction, is, attested, to, in, 43, cases, in, the, written, sources, but, only, 4, of, them, were, confirmed, by, archaeological, evidence, trombley, and, macmullen, say, part, of, what, creates, this, discrepancy, are, details, in, the, historical, sources, that, are, commonly, ambiguous, and, unclear, for, example, malalas, claimed, constantine, destroyed, all, the, temples, then, he, said, theodosius, did, then, he, said, constantine, converted, them, all, to, churches, 246, 282, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, desire, on, the, part, of, the, emperor, to, institute, a, systematic, destruction, of, temples, anywhere, in, the, theodosian, code, and, no, evidence, in, the, archaeological, record, that, extensive, temple, destruction, ever, took, place, 63, according, to, the, cambridge, ancient, history, the, theodosian, law, code, is, a, set, of, laws, originally, dated, from, constantine, to, theodosius, i, that, were, gathered, together, organized, by, theme, and, reissued, throughout, the, empire, between, 389, and, 391, jill, harries, and, ian, s, wood, explain, that, in, their, original, forms, these, laws, were, created, by, different, emperors, and, governors, to, resolve, the, issues, of, a, particular, place, at, a, particular, time, they, were, not, intended, as, general, laws, 5, 16, local, politics, and, culture, had, produced, divergent, attitudes, and, as, a, result, these, laws, present, a, series, of, conflicting, opinions, for, example, some, laws, called, for, the, complete, destruction, of, the, temples, and, others, for, their, preservation, 47, french, historian, of, antiquity, philippe, fleury, observes, that, ammianus, marcellinus, says, this, legal, complexity, produced, corruption, forgery, of, rescripts, falsified, appeals, and, costly, judicial, delays, the, theodosian, law, code, has, long, been, one, of, the, principal, historical, sources, for, the, study, of, late, antiquity, gibbon, described, the, theodosian, decrees, in, his, memoires, as, a, work, of, history, rather, than, jurisprudence, brown, says, the, language, of, these, laws, is, uniformly, vehement, and, penalties, are, harsh, and, frequently, horrifying, leading, some, historians, such, as, ramsay, macmullen, to, see, them, as, a, declaration, of, war, on, traditional, religious, practices, 100, 638, it, is, a, common, belief, the, laws, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, decline, of, paganism, 12, yet, many, contemporary, scholars, such, as, lepelly, brown, and, cameron, question, the, use, of, the, code, a, legal, document, not, an, actual, historical, work, for, understanding, history, one, of, many, problems, with, using, the, theodosian, code, as, a, record, of, history, is, described, by, archaeologists, luke, lavan, and, michael, mulryan, they, explain, that, the, code, can, be, seen, to, document, christian, ambition, but, not, historic, reality, the, overtly, violent, fourth, century, that, one, would, expect, to, find, from, taking, the, laws, at, face, value, is, not, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, from, around, the, mediterranean, 41, the, picture, of, theodosius, as, the, most, pious, emperor, who, presided, over, the, end, of, paganism, through, the, aggressive, application, of, law, and, coercion, a, view, which, r, malcolm, errington, says, has, dominated, the, european, historical, tradition, almost, to, this, day, was, first, written, by, theodoret, who, in, errington, s, view, had, a, habit, of, ignoring, facts, and, cherry, picking, in, the, centuries, following, his, death, theodosius, gained, a, reputation, as, the, champion, of, orthodoxy, and, the, vanquisher, of, paganism, but, modern, historians, see, this, as, a, later, interpretation, of, history, by, christian, writers, rather, than, actual, history, an, increase, in, the, variety, and, abundance, of, sources, has, brought, about, the, reinterpretation, of, religion, of, this, era, according, to, salzman, although, the, debate, on, the, death, of, paganism, continues, scholars, by, and, large, concur, that, the, once, dominant, notion, of, overt, pagan, christian, religious, conflict, cannot, fully, explain, the, texts, and, artifacts, or, the, social, religious, and, political, realities, of, late, antique, rome, 2, scholars, agree, that, theodosius, gathered, copious, legislation, on, religious, subjects, and, that, he, continued, the,
