and, mari, he, ousted, ishme, dagan, i, the, king, of, assyria, and, forced, his, son, mut, ashkur, to, pay, tribute, bringing, almost, all, of, mesopotamia, under, babylonian, rule, hammurabi, is, best, known, for, having, issued, the, code, of, hammurabi, which, he, claimed, to, have, received, from, shamash, the, babylonian, god, of, justice, unlike, earlier, sumerian, law, codes, such, as, the, code, of, ur, nammu, which, had, focused, on, compensating, the, victim, of, the, crime, the, law, of, hammurabi, was, one, of, the, first, law, codes, to, place, greater, emphasis, on, the, physical, punishment, of, the, perpetrator, it, prescribed, specific, penalties, for, each, crime, and, is, among, the, first, codes, to, establish, the, presumption, of, innocence, they, were, intended, to, limit, what, a, wronged, person, was, permitted, to, do, in, retribution, the, code, of, hammurabi, and, the, law, of, moses, in, the, torah, contain, numerous, similarities, hammurabi, was, seen, by, many, as, a, god, within, his, own, lifetime, after, his, death, hammurabi, was, revered, as, a, great, conqueror, who, spread, civilization, and, forced, all, peoples, to, pay, obeisance, to, marduk, the, national, god, of, the, babylonians, later, his, military, accomplishments, became, de, emphasized, and, his, role, as, the, ideal, lawgiver, became, the, primary, aspect, of, his, legacy, for, later, mesopotamians, hammurabi, s, reign, became, the, frame, of, reference, for, all, events, occurring, in, the, distant, past, even, after, the, empire, he, built, collapsed, he, was, still, revered, as, a, model, ruler, and, many, kings, across, the, near, east, claimed, him, as, an, ancestor, hammurabi, was, rediscovered, by, archaeologists, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, and, has, since, been, seen, as, an, important, figure, in, the, history, of, law, hammurabi, ascended, to, the, throne, as, the, king, of, a, minor, kingdom, in, the, midst, of, a, complex, geopolitical, situation, hammurabi, was, an, amorite, first, dynasty, king, of, the, city, state, of, babylon, and, inherited, the, power, from, his, father, sin, muballit, in, c, 1792, bc, babylon, was, one, of, the, many, largely, amorite, ruled, city, states, that, dotted, the, central, and, southern, mesopotamian, plains, and, waged, war, on, each, other, for, control, of, fertile, agricultural, land, though, many, cultures, co, existed, in, mesopotamia, babylonian, culture, gained, a, degree, of, prominence, among, the, literate, classes, throughout, the, middle, east, under, hammurabi, the, kings, who, came, before, hammurabi, had, founded, a, relatively, minor, city, state, in, 1894, bc, which, controlled, little, territory, outside, of, the, city, itself, babylon, was, overshadowed, by, older, larger, and, more, powerful, kingdoms, such, as, elam, assyria, isin, eshnunna, and, larsa, for, a, century, or, so, after, its, founding, however, his, father, sin, muballit, had, begun, to, consolidate, rule, of, a, small, area, of, south, central, mesopotamia, under, babylonian, rule, and, by, the, time, of, his, reign, had, conquered, the, minor, city, states, of, borsippa, kish, and, sippar, the, powerful, kingdom, of, eshnunna, controlled, the, upper, tigris, river, while, larsa, controlled, the, river, delta, to, the, east, of, mesopotamia, lay, the, powerful, kingdom, of, elam, which, regularly, invaded, and, forced, tribute, upon, the, small, states, of, southern, mesopotamia, in, northern, mesopotamia, the, assyrian, king, shamshi, adad, i, who, had, already, inherited, centuries, old, assyrian, colonies, in, asia, minor, had, expanded, his, territory, into, the, levant, and, central, mesopotamia, although, his, untimely, death, would, somewhat, fragment, his, empire, elam, larsa, the, first, few, years, of, hammurabi, s, reign, were, quite, peaceful, hammurabi, used, his, power, to, undertake, a, series, of, public, works, including, heightening, the, city, walls, for, defensive, purposes, and, expanding, the, temples, the, powerful, kingdom, of, elam, which, straddled, important, trade, routes, across, the, zagros, mountains, invaded, the, mesopotamian, plain, with, allies, among, the, plain, states, elam, attacked, and, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, eshnunna, destroying, a, number, of, cities, and, imposing, its, rule, on, portions, of, the, plain, for, the, first, time, in, order, to, consolidate, its, position, elam, tried, to, start, a, war, between, hammurabi, s, babylonian, kingdom, and, the, kingdom, of, larsa, hammurabi, and, the, king, of, larsa, made, an, alliance, when, they, discovered, this, duplicity, and, were, able, to, crush, the, elamites, although, larsa, did, not, contribute, greatly, to, the, military, effort, angered, by, larsa, s, failure, to, come, to, his, aid, hammurabi, turned, on, that, southern, power, thus, gaining, control, of, the, entirety, of, the, lower, mesopotamian, plain, by, c, 1763, bc, as, hammurabi, was, assisted, during, the, war, in, the, south, by, his, allies, from, the, north, such, as, yamhad, and, mari, the, absence, of, soldiers, in, the, north, led, to, unrest, continuing, his, expansion, hammurabi, turned, his, attention, northward, quelling, the, unrest, soon, after, he, destroyed, eshnunna, next, the, babylonian, armies, conquered, the, remaining, northern, states, including, babylon, s, former, ally, mari, although, it, is, possible, that, the, conquest, of, mari, was, a, surrender, without, any, actual, conflict, hammurabi, entered, into, a, protracted, war, with, ishme, dagan, i, of, assyria, for, control, of, mesopotamia, with, both, kings, making, alliances, with, minor, states, in, order, to, gain, the, upper, hand, eventually, hammurabi, prevailed, ousting, ishme, dagan, i, just, before, his, own, death, mut, ashkur, the, new, king, of, assyria, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, hammurabi, in, just, a, few, years, hammurabi, succeeded, in, uniting, all, of, mesopotamia, under, his, rule, the, assyrian, kingdom, survived, but, was, forced, to, pay, tribute, during, his, reign, and, of, the, major, city, states, in, the, region, only, aleppo, and, qatna, to, the, west, in, the, levant, maintained, their, independence, however, one, stele, stone, monument, of, hammurabi, has, been, found, as, far, north, as, diyarbekir, where, he, claims, the, title, king, of, the, amorites, vast, numbers, of, contract, tablets, dated, to, the, reigns, of, hammurabi, and, his, successors, have, been, discovered, as, well, as, 55, of, his, own, letters, these, letters, give, a, glimpse, into, the, daily, trials, of, ruling, an, empire, from, dealing, with, floods, and, mandating, changes, to, a, flawed, calendar, to, taking, care, of, babylon, s, massive, herds, of, livestock, hammurabi, died, and, passed, the, reins, of, the, empire, on, to, his, son, samsu, iluna, in, c, 1750, bc, under, whose, rule, the, babylonian, empire, quickly, began, to, unravel, the, code, of, hammurabi, was, a, collection, of, 282, laws, dealing, with, a, wide, range, of, issues, it, is, not, the, earliest, surviving, law, code, but, was, proved, more, influential, in, world, politics, and, international, relations, as, instead, of, focusing, on, compensating, the, victim, of, crime, as, in, earlier, sumerian, law, codes, the, code, of, hammurabi, instead, focused, on, physically, punishing, the, perpetrator, it, was, also, one, of, the, first, law, codes, to, place, restrictions, on, what, a, wronged, person, was, allowed, to, do, in, retribution, and, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, the, idea, of, presumption, of, innocence, suggesting, that, the, accused, and, accuser, have, the, opportunity, to, provide, evidence, the, structure, of, the, code, is, very, specific, with, each, offense, receiving, a, specified, punishment, many, offenses, resulted, in, death, disfigurement, or, the, use, of, the, lex, talionis, philosophy, eye, for, eye, tooth, for, tooth, the, code, of, hammurabi, was, inscribed, on, a, stele, and, placed, in, a, public, place, so, that, all, could, see, it, although, it, is, thought, that, few, were, literate, the, stele, was, later, plundered, by, the, elamites, and, removed, to, their, capital, susa, it, was, rediscovered, there, in, 1901, in, iran, and, is, now, in, the, louvre, museum, in, paris, the, code, of, hammurabi, contains, 282, laws, written, by, scribes, on, 12, tablets, unlike, earlier, laws, it, was, written, in, akkadian, the, daily, language, of, babylon, and, could, therefore, be, read, by, any, literate, person, in, the, city, at, this, time, akkadian, replaced, sumerian, and, hammurabi, began, language, reforms, that, would, make, akkadian, the, most, common, language, at, this, time, a, carving, at, the, top, of, the, stele, portrays, hammurabi, receiving, the, laws, from, shamash, the, babylonian, god, of, justice, and, the, preface, states, that, hammurabi, was, chosen, by, shamash, to, bring, the, laws, to, the, people, because, of, hammurabi, s, reputation, as, a, lawgiver, his, depiction, can, be, found, in, law, buildings, throughout, the, world, hammurabi, is, one, of, the, 23, lawgivers, depicted, in, marble, bas, reliefs, in, the, chamber, of, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, in, the, united, states, capitol, a, frieze, by, adolph, weinman, depicting, the, great, lawgivers, of, history, including, hammurabi, is, on, the, south, wall, of, the, u, s, supreme, court, building, hammurabi, was, honored, above, all, other, kings, of, the, second, millennium, bc, and, he, received, the, unique, honor, of, being, declared, to, be, a, god, within, his, own, lifetime, the, personal, name, hammurabi, ili, meaning, hammurabi, is, my, god, became, common, during, and, after, his, reign, in, writings, from, shortly, after, his, death, hammurabi, is, commemorated, mainly, for, three, achievements, bringing, victory, in, war, bringing, peace, and, bringing, justice, hammurabi, s, conquests, came, to, be, regarded, as, part, of, a, sacred, mission, to, spread, civilization, to, all, nations, a, stele, from, ur, glorifies, him, in, his, own, voice, as, a, mighty, ruler, who, forces, evil, into, submission, and, compels, all, peoples, to, worship, marduk, the, stele, declares, the, people, of, elam, gutium, subartu, and, tukrish, whose, mountains, are, distant, and, whose, languages, are, obscure, i, placed, into, hand, i, myself, continued, to, put, straight, their, confused, minds, a, later, hymn, also, written, in, hammurabi, s, own, voice, extols, him, as, a, powerful, supernatural, force, for, marduk, i, am, the, king, the, brace, that, grasps, wrongdoers, that, makes, people, of, one, mind, i, am, the, great, dragon, among, kings, who, throws, their, counsel, in, disarray, i, am, the, net, that, is, stretched, over, the, enemy, i,

breaks, nets, and, scepters, i, am, the, battle, net, that, catches, him, who, offends, me, after, extolling, hammurabi, s, military, accomplishments, the, hymn, finally, declares, i, am, hammurabi, the, king, of, justice, in, later, commemorations, hammurabi, s, role, as, a, great, lawgiver, came, to, be, emphasized, above, all, his, other, accomplishments, and, his, military, achievements, became, de, emphasized, hammurabi, s, reign, became, the, point, of, reference, for, all, events, in, the, distant, past, a, hymn, to, the, goddess, ishtar, whose, language, suggests, it, was, written, during, the, reign, of, ammisaduqa, hammurabi, s, fourth, successor, declares, the, king, who, first, heard, this, song, as, a, song, of, your, heroism, is, hammurabi, this, song, for, you, was, composed, in, his, reign, may, he, be, given, life, forever, for, centuries, after, his, death, hammurabi, s, laws, continued, to, be, copied, by, scribes, as, part, of, their, writing, exercises, and, they, were, even, partially, translated, into, sumerian, during, the, reign, of, hammurabi, babylon, usurped, the, position, of, most, holy, city, in, southern, mesopotamia, from, its, predecessor, nippur, under, the, rule, of, hammurabi, s, successor, samsu, iluna, the, short, lived, babylonian, empire, began, to, collapse, in, northern, mesopotamia, both, the, amorites, and, babylonians, were, driven, from, assyria, by, puzur, sin, a, native, akkadian, speaking, ruler, c, 1740, bc, around, the, same, time, native, akkadian, speakers, threw, off, amorite, babylonian, rule, in, the, far, south, of, mesopotamia, creating, the, sealand, dynasty, in, more, or, less, the, region, of, ancient, sumer, hammurabi, s, ineffectual, successors, met, with, further, defeats, and, loss, of, territory, at, the, hands, of, assyrian, kings, such, as, adasi, and, bel, ibni, as, well, as, to, the, sealand, dynasty, to, the, south, elam, to, the, east, and, to, the, kassites, from, the, northeast, thus, was, babylon, quickly, reduced, to, the, small, and, minor, state, it, had, once, been, upon, its, founding, the, coup, de, grace, for, the, hammurabi, s, amorite, dynasty, occurred, in, 1595, bc, when, babylon, was, sacked, and, conquered, by, the, powerful, hittite, empire, thereby, ending, all, amorite, political, presence, in, mesopotamia, however, the, indo, european, speaking, hittites, did, not, remain, turning, over, babylon, to, their, kassite, allies, a, people, speaking, a, language, isolate, from, the, zagros, mountains, region, this, kassite, dynasty, ruled, babylon, for, over, 400, years, and, adopted, many, aspects, of, the, babylonian, culture, including, hammurabi, s, code, of, laws, even, after, the, fall, of, the, amorite, dynasty, however, hammurabi, was, still, remembered, and, revered, when, the, elamite, king, shutruk, nahhunte, i, raided, babylon, in, 1158, bc, and, carried, off, many, stone, monuments, he, had, most, of, the, inscriptions, on, these, monuments, erased, and, new, inscriptions, carved, into, them, on, the, stele, containing, hammurabi, s, laws, however, only, four, or, five, columns, were, wiped, out, and, no, new, inscription, was, ever, added, over, a, thousand, years, after, hammurabi, s, death, the, kings, of, suhu, a, land, along, the, euphrates, river, just, northwest, of, babylon, claimed, him, as, their, ancestor, a, neo, babylonian, royal, inscription, which, was, intended, for, display, on, a, stele, commemorates, a, royal, grant, of, tax, exemptions, to, nine, babylonian, cities, and, presents, the, royal, protagonist, as, a, second, hammurabi, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, code, of, hammurabi, became, a, major, center, of, debate, in, the, heated, babel, und, bibel, babylon, and, bible, controversy, in, germany, over, the, relationship, between, the, bible, and, ancient, babylonian, texts, in, january, 1902, the, german, assyriologist, friedrich, delitzsch, gave, a, lecture, at, the, sing, akademie, zu, berlin, in, front, of, the, kaiser, and, his, wife, in, which, he, argued, that, the, mosaic, laws, of, the, old, testament, were, directly, copied, off, the, code, of, hammurabi, delitzsch, s, lecture, was, so, controversial, that, by, september, 1903, he, had, managed, to, collect, 1, 350, short, articles, from, newspapers, and, journals, over, 300, longer, ones, and, twenty, eight, pamphlets, all, written, in, response, to, this, lecture, as, well, as, the, preceding, one, about, the, flood, story, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, these, articles, were, overwhelmingly, critical, of, delitzsch, though, a, few, were, sympathetic, the, kaiser, distanced, himself, from, delitzsch, and, his, radical, views, and, in, fall, of, 1904, delitzsch, was, forced, to, give, his, third, lecture, in, cologne, and, frankfurt, am, main, rather, than, in, berlin, the, putative, relationship, between, the, mosaic, law, and, the, code, of, hammurabi, later, became, a, major, part, of, delitzsch, s, argument, in, his, 1920, 21, book, die, gro, e, t, uschung, the, great, deception, that, the, hebrew, bible, was, irredeemably, contaminated, by, babylonian, influence, and, that, only, by, eliminating, the, human, old, testament, entirely, could, christians, finally, believe, in, the, true, aryan, message, of, the, new, testament, in, the, early, twentieth, century, many, scholars, believed, that, hammurabi, was, amraphel, the, king, of, shinar, in, the, book, of, genesis, 14, 1, this, view, has, now, been, largely, rejected, and, amraphel, s, existence, is, not, attested, in, any, writings, from, outside, the, bible, parallels, between, this, narrative, and, the, giving, of, the, covenant, code, to, moses, by, yahweh, atop, mount, sinai, in, the, biblical, book, of, exodus, and, similarities, between, the, two, legal, codes, suggest, a, common, ancestor, in, the, semitic, background, of, the, two, nonetheless, fragments, of, previous, law, codes, have, been, found, and, it, is, unlikely, that, the, mosaic, laws, were, directly, inspired, by, the, code, of, hammurabi, some, scholars, have, disputed, this, david, p, wright, argues, that, the, jewish, covenant, code, is, directly, primarily, and, throughout, based, upon, the, laws, of, hammurabi, in, 2010, a, team, of, archaeologists, from, hebrew, university, discovered, a, cuneiform, tablet, dating, to, the, eighteenth, or, seventeenth, century, bc, at, hazor, in, israel, containing, laws, clearly, derived, from, the, code, of,
