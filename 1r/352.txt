he, had, a, brief, but, unstable, romance, polonskaya, who, was, in, love, with, the, poet, but, unwilling, to, leave, her, husband, was, the, last, one, to, see, mayakovsky, alive, but, as, lilya, brik, stated, in, her, memoirs, the, idea, of, suicide, was, like, a, chronic, disease, inside, him, and, like, any, chronic, disease, it, worsened, under, circumstances, that, for, him, were, undesirable, according, to, polonskaya, mayakovsky, mentioned, suicide, on, 13, april, when, the, two, were, at, valentin, katayev, s, place, but, she, thought, he, was, trying, to, emotionally, blackmail, her, and, refused, to, believe, for, a, second, could, do, such, a, thing, the, circumstances, of, mayakovsky, s, death, became, a, matter, of, lasting, controversy, it, appeared, that, the, suicide, note, had, been, written, two, days, before, his, death, soon, after, the, poet, s, death, lilya, and, osip, brik, were, hastily, sent, abroad, the, bullet, removed, from, his, body,

himself, killed, fueling, speculation, about, the, nature, of, mayakovsky, s, death, such, speculation, often, alluding, to, suspicion, of, murder, by, state, services, especially, intensified, during, the, periods, of, first, krushchevian, de, stalinisation, later, glasnost, and, perestroika, as, soviet, politicians, sought, to, weaken, stalin, s, reputation, or, brik, s, and, by, association, stalin, s, and, the, positions, of, contemporary, opponents, according, to, chantal, sundaram, the, extent, to, which, rumours, of, mayakovsky, s, murder, remained, widespread, is, indicated, by, the, fact, that, even, as, late, as, the, end, of, 1991, they, prompted, the, state, mayakovsky, museum, to, commission, an, expert, medical, and, criminological, inquiry, into, the, material, evidence, of, his, death, kept, in, the, museum, photographs, the, shirt, with, traces, from, the, gunshot, the, carpet, on, which, mayakovsky, fell, and, the, authenticity, of, the, suicide, note, the, possibility, of, a, forgery, suggested, by, koloskov, had, survived, as, a, theory, with, different, variants, but, the, results, of, a, detailed, hand, writing, analysis, found, that, the, suicide, note, was, undoubtedly, written, by, mayakovsky, and, also, included, the, conclusion, that, its, irregularities, depict, a, diagnostic, complex, testifying, to, the, influence, at, the, moment, of, execution, of, disconcerting, factors, among, which, the, most, probable, is, a, psycho, physiological, state, linked, with, agitation, although, the, findings, are, hardly, surprising, the, event, is, indicative, of, a, fascination, with, mayakovsky, s, contradictory, relationship, with, the, soviet, authorities, which, survived, into, the, era, of, perestroika, despite, the, fact, that, he, was, being, attacked, and, rejected, for, his, political, conformism, at, this, time, mayakovsky, met, husband, and, wife, osip, and, lilya, brik, in, july, 1915, at, their, dacha, in, malakhovka, nearby, moscow, soon, after, that, lilya, s, sister, elsa, triolet, who, d, had, a, brief, affair, with, the, poet, before, invited, him, to, the, briks, petrograd, flat, the, couple, at, the, time, showed, no, interest, in, literature, and, were, successful, coral, traders, that, evening, mayakovsky, recited, the, yet, unpublished, poem, a, cloud, in, trousers, and, announced, it, as, dedicated, to, the, hostess, for, you, lilya, that, was, the, happiest, day, in, my, life, was, how, he, referred, to, the, episode, in, his, autobiography, years, later, according, to, lilya, brik, s, memoirs, her, husband, too, fell, in, love, with, the, poet, how, could, i, have, possibly, failed, to, fall, for, him, if, osya, loved, him, so, she, once, argued, whereas, volodya, did, not, merely, fall, in, love, with, me, he, attacked, me, it, was, an, assault, for, two, and, a, half, years, i, didn, t, have, a, moment, s, peace, i, understood, right, away, that, volodya, was, a, genius, but, i, didn, t, like, him, i, didn, t, like, clamorous, people, i, didn, t, like, the, fact, that, he, was, so, tall, and, people, in, the, street, would, stare, at, him, i, was, annoyed, that, he, enjoyed, listening, to, his, own, voice, i, couldn, t, even, stand, the, name, mayakovsky, sounding, so, much, like, a, cheap, pen, name, both, mayakovsky, s, persistent, adoration, and, rough, appearance, irritated, her, it, was, allegedly, to, please, her, that, mayakovsky, attended, a, dentist, started, to, wear, a, bow, tie, and, use, a, walking, stick, soon, after, osip, brik, published, a, cloud, in, trousers, in, september, 1915, mayakovsky, settled, in, the, palace, royal, hotel, at, the, pushkinskaya, street, petrograd, not, far, from, where, they, lived, he, introduced, the, couple, to, his, futurist, friends, and, the, briks, flat, quickly, evolved, into, a, modern, literary, salon, from, then, on, mayakovsky, was, dedicating, every, one, of, his, large, poems, with, the, obvious, exception, of, vladimir, ilyich, lenin, to, lilya, such, dedications, later, started, to, appear, even, in, the, texts, he, had, written, before, they, met, much, to, her, displeasure, in, summer, 1918, soon, after, lilya, and, vladimir, starred, in, the, film, encased, in, a, film, only, fragments, of, which, survived, mayakovsky, and, the, briks, moved, in, together, in, march, 1919, all, three, came, to, moscow, and, in, 1920, settled, in, a, flat, at, the, gondrikov, lane, taganka, in, 1920, mayakovsky, had, a, brief, romance, with, lilya, lavinskaya, an, artist, who, also, contributed, to, rosta, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, gleb, nikita, lavinsky, 1921, 1986, later, a, soviet, sculptor, in, 1922, lilya, brik, fell, in, love, with, alexander, krasnoshchyokov, the, head, of, the, soviet, prombank, this, affair, resulted, in, the, three, months, rift, which, was, to, some, extent, reflected, in, the, poem, about, that, 1923, brik, and, mayakovsky, s, relationships, ended, in, 1923, but, they, never, parted, now, i, am, free, from, placards, and, love, he, confessed, in, the, poem, called, for, the, jubilee, 1924, still, when, in, 1926, mayakovsky, was, granted, a, state, owned, flat, at, the, gendrikov, lane, in, moscow, all, three, of, them, moved, in, and, lived, there, until, 1930, having, turned, the, place, into, the, lef, headquarters, mayakovsky, continued, to, profess, his, devotion, to, lilya, whom, he, considered, a, family, member, it, was, brik, who, in, the, mid, 1930s, famously, addressed, stalin, with, a, personal, letter, which, made, all, the, difference, in, the, way, the, poet, s, legacy, has, been, treated, since, in, the, ussr, still, she, had, many, detractors, among, them, lyudmila, mayakovskaya, the, poet, s, sister, who, regarded, her, as, an, insensitive, femme, fatale, and, cynical, manipulator, who, had, never, been, really, interested, in, either, mayakovsky, or, his, poetry, to, me, she, was, a, kind, of, monster, but, mayakovsky, apparently, loved, her, that, way, armed, with, a, whip, remembered, poet, andrey, voznesensky, who, knew, lilya, brik, personally, literary, critic, and, historian, viktor, shklovsky, who, resented, what, he, saw, as, the, briks, exploitation, of, mayakovsky, both, when, he, lived, and, after, his, death, once, called, them, a, family, of, corpse, mongers, in, summer, 1925, mayakovsky, traveled, to, new, york, where, he, met, russian, migr, elli, jones, born, yelizaveta, petrovna, zibert, an, interpreter, who, spoke, russian, french, german, and, english, fluently, they, fell, in, love, for, three, months, were, inseparable, but, decided, to, keep, their, affair, secret, soon, after, the, poet, s, return, to, the, soviet, union, elli, gave, birth, to, daughter, patricia, mayakovsky, saw, the, girl, just, once, in, nice, france, in, 1928, when, she, was, three, patricia, thompson, a, professor, of, philosophy, and, women, s, studies, at, lehman, college, in, new, york, city, is, the, author, of, the, book, mayakovsky, in, manhattan, in, which, she, told, the, story, of, her, parents, love, affair, relying, on, her, mother, s, unpublished, memoirs, and, their, private, conversations, prior, to, her, death, in, 1985, thompson, traveled, to, russia, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, looking, for, her, roots, was, welcomed, there, with, respect, and, since, then, started, to, use, her, russian, name, yelena, vladimirovna, mayakovskaya, in, 1928, in, paris, mayakovsky, met, russian, migr, tatyana, yakovleva, a, 22, year, old, model, working, for, the, chanel, fashion, house, and, niece, of, painter, alexandre, jacovleff, he, fell, in, love, madly, and, wrote, two, poems, dedicated, to, her, letter, to, comrade, kostrov, on, the, essence, of, love, and, letter, to, tatiana, yakovleva, some, argued, that, since, it, was, elsa, triolet, lilya, s, sister, who, acquainted, them, the, liaison, might, have, been, the, result, of, brik, s, intrigue, aimed, at, stopping, the, poet, from, getting, closer, to, elli, jones, and, especially, daughter, patricia, but, the, power, of, this, passion, apparently, caught, her, by, surprise, mayakovsky, tried, to, persuade, tatyana, to, return, to, russia, but, she, refused, in, late, 1929, he, made, an, attempt, to, travel, to, paris, in, order, to, marry, her, lover, but, was, refused, a, visa, for, the, first, time, again, as, many, believed, due, to, lilya, s, making, full, use, of, her, numerous, connections, it, became, known, that, she, accidentally, read, mayakovsky, out, a, letter, from, paris, alleging, that, tatiana, was, getting, married, while, as, it, turned, out, soon, the, latter, s, wedding, was, not, on, the, agenda, at, that, very, moment, lydia, chukovskaya, insisted, it, was, the, ever, powerful, yakov, agranov, another, one, of, lilya, s, lovers, who, prevented, mayakovsky, s, getting, a, visa, upon, her, request, in, the, late, 1920s, mayakovsky, had, two, more, affairs, with, student, later, goslitizdat, editor, natalya, bryukhanenko, 1905, 1984, and, with, veronika, polonskaya, 1908, 1994, a, young, mat, actress, then, the, wife, of, actor, mikhail, yanshin, it, was, veronika, s, unwillingness, to, divorce, the, latter, that, resulted, in, her, rows, with, mayakovsky, the, last, of, which, preceded, the, poet, s, suicide, yet, according, to, natalya, bryukhanenko, it, was, not, polonskaya, but, yakovleva, whom, he, was, pining, for, in, january, 1929, mayakovsky, he, would, put, a, bullet, to, his, brain, if, he, didn, t, see, that, woman, any, time, soon, she, later, remembered, which, on, 14, april, 1930, he, did, mayakovsky, s, early, poems, established, him, as, one, of, the, more, original, poets, to, come, out, of, the, russian, futurism, a, movement, rejecting, the, traditional, poetry, in, favour, of, formal, experimentation, and, welcoming, the, social, change, promised, by, modern, technology, his, 1913, verses, surreal, seemingly, disjointed, and, nonsensical, relying, on, forceful, rhythms, and, exaggerated, imagery, with, the, words, split, into, pieces, and, staggered, across, the, page, peppered, with, street, language, were, considered, unpoetic, in, literary, circles, at, the, time, while, the, confrontational, aesthetics, of, his, fellow, futurist, group, members, poetry, were, mostly, confined, to, formal, experiments, mayakovsky, s, idea, was, creating, the, new, democratic, language, of, the, streets, in, 1914, his, first, large, work, an, avant, garde, tragedy, vladimir, mayakovsky, came, out, the, fierce, critique, of, the, city, life, and, capitalism, in, general, was, at, the, same, time, a, paean, to, the, modern, industrial, power, featuring, the, protagonist, sacrificing, himself, for, the, sake, of, the, people, s, happiness, in, the, future, in, september, 1915, a, cloud, in, trousers, came, out, mayakovsky, s, first, major, poem, of, appreciable, length, it, depicted, the, subjects, of, love, revolution, religion, and, art, written, from, the, vantage, point, of, a, spurned, lover, the, language, of, the, work, was, the, language, of, the, streets, and, mayakovsky, went, to, considerable, lengths, to, debunk, idealistic, and, romanticized, notions, of, poetry, and, poets, your, thoughts, dreaming, on, a, softened, brain, like, an, over, fed, lackey, on, a, greasy, settee, with, my, heart, s, bloody, tatters, i, ll, mock, again, impudent, and, caustic, i, ll, jeer, to,

recommended, that, he, d, be, hospitalized, immediately, in, retrospect, it, is, seen, as, a, groundbreaking, piece, introducing, the, new, forms, of, expressing, social, anger, and, personal, frustrations, the, period, from, 1917, to, 1921, was, a, fruitful, one, for, mayakovsky, who, greeted, the, bolshevik, revolution, with, a, number, of, poetic, and, dramatic, works, starting, with, ode, to, the, revolution, 1918, and, left, march, 1918, a, hymn, to, the, proletarian, might, calling, for, the, fight, against, the, enemies, of, the, revolution, mystery, bouffe, 1918, revised,

patterns, different, typesetting, styles, and, using, neologisms, which, were, describing, the, currents, events, in, dynamics, in, three, years, he, produced, some, 1100, pieces, he, called, rosta, windows, in, 1921, mayakovsky, s, poem, 150, 000, 000, came, out, which, hailed, the, russian, people, s, mission, in, igniting, the, world, revolution, but, failed, to, impress, lenin, the, latter, praised, the, 1922, poem, re, conferences, a, scathing, satire, on, the, nascent, soviet, bureaucracy, starting, to, eat, up, the, apparently, flawed, state, system, mayakovsky, s, poetry, was, saturated, with, politics, but, the, love, theme, in, the, early, 1920s, became, prominent, too, mainly, in, i, love, 1922, and, about, that, 1923, both, dedicated, to, lilya, brik, whom, he,

1925, 1926, as, well, as, a, set, of, analytical, satirical, essays, in, 1926, mayakovsky, wrote, and, published, talking, with, the, taxman, about, poetry, the, first, in, a, series, of, works, criticizing, the, new, soviet, philistinism, the, result, of, the, new, economic, policy, his, 1927, epic, all, right, sought, to, unite, heroic, pathos, with, lyricism, and, irony, extoling, the,

plays, were, met, with, in, the, soviet, press, was, overstated, and, politically, charged, but, still, in, retrospect, mayakovsky, s, work, in, the, 1920s, is, regarded, as, patchy, even, vladimir, ilyich, lenin, and, all, right, being, inferior, to, his, passionate, and, innovative, 1910s, work, several, authors, among, them, valentin, katayev, and, close, friend, boris, pasternak, reproached,

the, most, talented, poet, of, our, soviet, epoch, indifference, to, his, cultural, heritage, amounts, to, a, crime, brik, s, complaints, are, in, my, opinion, justified, the, effect, of, this, letter, was, startling, mayakovsky, was, instantly, hailed, a, soviet, classic, proving, to, be, the, only, member, of, the, artistic, avant, garde, of, the, early, 20th, century, to, enter, the,
