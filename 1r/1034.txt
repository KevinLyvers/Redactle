because, mithridates, ii, demanded, it, tigranes, daughter, ariazate, had, also, married, a, son, of, mithridates, ii, which, has, been, suggested, by, the, modern, historian, edward, d, browa, to, have, taken, place, shortly, before, he, ascended, the, armenian, throne, as, a, guarantee, of, his, loyalty, tigranes, would, remain, a, parthian, vassal, until, the, late, 80s, bc, when, he, came, to, power, the, foundation, upon, which, tigranes, was, to, build, his, empire, was, already, in, place, a, legacy, of, the, founder, of, the, artaxiad, dynasty, artaxias, i, and, subsequent, kings, the, mountains, of, armenia, however, formed, natural, borders, between, the, different, regions, of, the, country, and, as, a, result, the, feudalistic, nakharars, had, significant, influence, over, the, regions, or, provinces, in, which, they, were, based, this, did, not, suit, tigranes, who, wanted, to, create, a, centralist, empire, he, thus, proceeded, by, consolidating, his, power, within, armenia, before, embarking, on, his, campaign, he, deposed, artanes, the, last, king, of, the, kingdom, of, sophene, and, a, descendant, of, zariadres, during, the, first, mithridatic, war, 89, 85, bc, tigranes, supported, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, but, was, careful, not, to, become, directly, involved, in, the, war, he, rapidly, built, up, his, power, and, established, an, alliance, with, mithridates, vi, marrying, his, daughter, cleopatra, tigranes, agreed, to, extend, his, influence, in, the, east, while, mithridates, set, to, conquer, roman, land, in, asia, minor, and, in, europe, by, creating, a, stronger, hellenistic, state, mithridates, was, to, contend, with, the, well, established, roman, foothold, in, europe, mithridates, executed, a, planned, general, attack, on, romans, and, italians, in, asia, minor, tapping, into, local, discontent, with, the, romans, and, their, taxes, and, urging, the, peoples, of, asia, minor, to, raise, against, foreign, influence, the, slaughter, of, 80, 000, people, in, the, province, of, asia, minor, was, known, as, the, asiatic, vespers, the, two, kings, attempts, to, control, cappadocia, and, then, the, massacres, resulted, in, guaranteed, roman, intervention, the, senate, decided, that, lucius, cornelius, sulla, who, was, then, one, of, the, consuls, would, command, the, army, against, mithridates, the, french, historian, ren, grousset, remarked, that, in, their, alliance, mithridates, was, somewhat, subservient, to, tigranes, after, the, death, of, mithridates, ii, of, parthia, his, son, gotarzes, i, succeeded, him, this, was, disputed, by, sinatruces, which, caused, a, parthian, civil, war, tigranes, with, rome, involved, in, a, social, war, and, parthia, involved, in, a, succession, dispute, quickly, invaded, cappadocia, but, was, forced, out, by, the, roman, consul, sulla, between, 88, 85, bc, he, retook, adiabene, gordyene, and, media, atropatene, in, 83, bc, after, bloody, strife, for, the, throne, of, syria, governed, by, the, seleucids, the, syrians, decided, to, choose, tigranes, as, the, protector, of, their, kingdom, and, offered, him, the, crown, of, syria, magadates, was, appointed, as, his, governor, in, antioch, he, then, conquered, phoenicia, and, cilicia, effectively, putting, an, end, to, the, last, remnants, of, the, seleucid, empire, though, a, few, holdout, cities, appear, to, have, recognized, the, shadowy, boy, king, seleucus, vii, philometor, as, the, legitimate, king, during, his, reign, the, southern, border, of, his, domain, reached, as, far, as, ptolemais, modern, akko, many, of, the, inhabitants, of, conquered, cities, were, sent, to, his, new, metropolis, of, tigranocerta, at, its, height, his, empire, extended, from, the, pontic, alps, in, modern, north, eastern, turkey, to, mesopotamia, and, from, the, caspian, sea, to, the, mediterranean, a, series, of, victories, led, him, to, assume, the, achaemenid, title, of, king, of, kings, which, even, the, parthian, kings, did, not, assume, appearing, on, coins, struck, after, 85, bc, he, was, called, tigranes, the, great, by, many, western, historians, and, writers, such, as, plutarch, the, king, of, kings, never, appeared, in, public, without, having, four, kings, attending, him, cicero, referring, to, his, success, in, the, east, said, that, he, made, the, republic, of, rome, tremble, before, the, prowess, of, his, arms, tigranes, coins, consist, of, tetradrachms, and, copper, coins, having, on, the, obverse, his, portrait, wearing, a, decorated, armenian, tiara, with, ear, flaps, the, reverse, has, a, completely, original, design, there, are, the, seated, tyche, of, antioch, and, the, river, god, orontes, at, her, feet, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, had, found, refuge, in, armenian, land, after, confronting, rome, considering, the, fact, that, tigranes, was, his, ally, and, relative, the, king, of, kings, eventually, came, into, direct, contact, with, rome, the, roman, commander, lucullus, demanded, the, expulsion, of, mithridates, from, armenia, to, comply, with, such, a, demand, would, be, in, effect, to, accept, the, status, of, vassal, to, rome, and, thus, tigranes, refused, charles, rollin, in, his, ancient, history, says, tigranes, to, whom, lucullus, had, sent, an, ambassador, though, of, no, great, power, in, the, beginning, of, his, reign, had, enlarged, it, so, much, by, a, series, of, successes, of, which, there, are, few, examples, that, he, was, commonly, surnamed, king, of, kings, after, having, overthrown, and, almost, ruined, the, family, of, the, kings, successors, of, the, great, seleucus, after, having, very, often, humbled, the, pride, of, the, parthians, transported, whole, cities, of, greeks, into, media, conquered, all, syria, and, palestine, and, given, laws, to, the, arabians, called, scenites, he, reigned, with, an, authority, respected, by, all, the, princes, of, asia, the, people, paid, him, honors, after, the, manners, of, the, east, even, to, adoration, lucullus, reaction, was, an, attack, that, was, so, precipitate, that, he, took, tigranes, by, surprise, according, to, roman, historians, mithrobazanes, one, of, tigranes, generals, told, tigranes, of, the, roman, approach, tigranes, was, according, to, keaveney, so, impressed, by, mithrobazanes, courage, that, he, appointed, mithrobazanes, to, command, an, army, against, lucullus, tigranes, sent, mithrobarzanes, with, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, cavalry, to, expel, the, invader, mithrobarzanes, charged, the, romans, while, they, were, setting, up, their, camp, but, was, met, by, a, 3, 500, strong, sentry, force, and, his, horsemen, were, routed, he, perished, in, the, attempt, after, this, defeat, tigranes, withdrew, north, to, armenia, to, regroup, leaving, lucullus, free, to, besiege, tigranocerta, when, tigranes, had, gathered, a, large, army, he, returned, to, confront, lucullus, on, october, 6, 69, bc, tigranes, much, larger, force, was, decisively, defeated, by, the, roman, army, under, lucullus, in, the, battle, of, tigranocerta, tigranes, treatment, of, the, inhabitants, the, majority, of, the, population, had, been, forced, to, move, to, the, city, led, disgruntled, city, guards, to, open, the, gates, of, the, city, to, the, romans, learning, of, this, tigranes, hurriedly, sent, 6000, cavalrymen, to, the, city, in, order, to, rescue, his, wives, and, some, of, his, assets, tigranes, escaped, capture, with, a, small, escort, on, october, 6, 68, bc, the, romans, approached, the, old, capital, of, artaxata, tigranes, and, mithridates, combined, armeno, pontic, army, of, 70, 000, men, formed, up, to, face, them, but, were, resoundingly, defeated, once, again, both, mithridates, and, tigranes, evaded, capture, by, the, victorious, romans, the, armenian, roman, wars, are, depicted, in, alexandre, dumas, voyage, to, the, caucasus, the, long, campaigning, and, hardships, that, lucullus, troops, had, endured, for, years, combined, with, a, perceived, lack, of, reward, in, the, form, of, plunder, led, to, successive, mutinies, among, the, legions, in, 68, 67, frustrated, by, the, rough, terrain, of, northern, armenia, and, seeing, the, worsening, morale, of, his, troops, lucullus, moved, back, south, and, put, nisibis, under, siege, tigranes, concluded, wrongly, that, nisibis, would, hold, out, and, sought, to, regain, those, parts, of, armenia, that, the, romans, had, captured, despite, his, continuous, success, in, battle, lucullus, could, still, not, capture, either, one, of, the, monarchs, with, lucullus, troops, now, refusing, to, obey, his, commands, but, agreeing, to, defend, positions, from, attack, the, senate, sent, pompey, to, recall, lucullus, to, rome, and, take, over, his, command, in, 67, bc, pompey, was, given, the, task, of, defeating, mithridates, and, tigranes, pompey, first, concentrated, on, attacking, mithridates, while, distracting, tigranes, by, engineering, a, parthian, attack, on, gordyene, phraates, iii, the, parthian, king, was, soon, persuaded, to, take, things, a, little, further, than, an, annexation, of, gordyene, when, a, son, of, tigranes, also, named, tigranes, went, to, join, the, parthians, and, persuaded, phraates, to, invade, armenia, in, an, attempt, to, replace, the, elder, tigranes, with, the, tigranes, the, younger, tigranes, decided, not, to, meet, the, invasion, in, the, field, but, instead, ensured, that, his, capital, artaxata, was, well, defended, and, withdrew, to, the, hill, country, phraates, soon, realized, that, artaxata, would, not, fall, without, a, protracted, siege, the, time, for, which, he, could, not, spare, due, to, his, fear, of, plots, at, home, once, phraates, left, tigranes, came, back, down, from, the, hills, and, drove, his, son, from, armenia, the, son, then, fled, to, pompey, in, 66, bc, pompey, advanced, into, armenia, with, tigranes, the, younger, and, tigranes, now, almost, 75, years, old, surrendered, pompey, allowed, him, to, retain, his, kingdom, shorn, of, his, conquests, as, he, planned, to, have, armenia, as, a, buffer, state, and, he, took, 6, 000, talents, 180, tonnes, of, silver, his, unfaithful, son, was, sent, back, to, rome, as, a, prisoner, tigranes, continued, to, rule, armenia, as, a, client, king, of, rome, he, died, in, 55, 54, at, age, 85, tigranes, had, four, sons, and, three, daughters, the, eldest, son, zariadres, according, to, appian, and, valerius, maximus, rebelled, against, tigranes, and, was, killed, during, a, battle, possibly, late, 90s, bce, appian, also, mentions, an, unnamed, younger, son, who, was, executed, for, conspiring, against, tigranes, he, disregarded, his, father, s, health, and, wore, tigranes, s, crown, tigranes, having, been, injured, during, a, hunting, accident, his, third, son, tigranes, the, younger, who, showed, great, care, for, his, injured, father, and, was, rewarded, for, his, loyalty, has, already, been, mentioned, he, is, also, alleged, to, have, led, a, military, campaign, in, 82, bce, tigranes, was, succeeded, by, his, fourth, and, youngest, son, artavasdes, ii, one, daughter, of, tigranes, according, to, cassius, dio, married, mithridates, i, of, atropatene, another, daughter, married, parthian, prince, pacorus, son, of, orodes, ii, parchments, of, avroman, also, mention, his, third, daughter, ariazate, automa, who, married, gotarzes, i, of, parthia, although, cleopatra, of, pontus, is, usually, considered, to, be, their, mother, appian, writes, that, she, gave, birth, to, three, sons, historian, gagik, sargsyan, considered, only, artavasdes, ii, and, one, of, the, unnamed, daughters, to, be, her, children, according, to, him, the, rest, had, a, different, mother, and, were, born, before, tigranes, became, king, the, reasoning, behind, it, is, that, if, tigranes, the, younger, did, indeed, lead, a, campaign, in, 82, bce, then, he, and, hence, his, two, older, brothers, and, possibly, two, sisters, would, be, too, old, to, be, cleopatra, s, children, another, argument, supporting, this, claim, would, be, the, situation, with, ariazate, as, she, was, probably, the, mother, of, orodes, i, r, 80, 75, bc, then, ariazate, could, not, have, been, the, daughter, of, cleopatra, who, married, tigranes, only, in, 94, bce, at, the, age, of, 15, or, 16, sargsyan, also, proposed, a, possible, candidate, as, tigranes, s, first, wife, and, the, children, s, mother, artaxiad, princess, zaruhi, a, daughter, of, tigranes, s, paternal, uncle, zariadres, and, granddaughter, of, artaxias, i, he, also, considered, likely, that, the, reason, for, the, rebellion, of, tigranes, s, son, zariadres, was, the, birth, of, artavasdes, who, was, declared, the, heir, by, virtue, of, being, born, to, a, king, and, not, a, prince, tigranes, is, a, typical, example, of, the, mixed, culture, of, his, period, the, ceremonial, of, his, court, was, of, achaemenid, origin, and, also, incorporated, parthian, aspects, he, had, greek, rhetoricians, and, philosophers, in, his, court, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, his, queen, cleopatra, greek, was, also, possibly, spoken, in, the, court, following, the, example, of, the, parthians, tigranes, adopted, the, title, of, philhellene, friend, of, the, greeks, the, layout, of, his, capital, tigranocerta, was, a, blend, of, greek, and, iranian, architecture, like, the, majority, armenia, s, inhabitants, tigranes, was, a, follower, of, zoroastrianism, on, his, crown, a, star, of, divinity, and, two, birds, of, prey, are, displayed, both, iranian, aspects, the, bird, of, prey, was, associated, with, the, khvarenah, i, e, kingly, glory, it, was, possibly, also, a, symbol, of, the, bird, of, the, deity, verethragna, over, the, course, of, his, conquests, tigranes, founded, four, cities, that, bore, his, name, including, the, capital, of, tigranocerta, tigranakert, tigranes, is, mentioned, in, macrobii, a, roman, essay, detailing, the, famous, long, livers, of, the, day, which, is, attributed, to, lucian, in, the, art, of, war, 1521, italian, political, philosopher, niccol, machiavelli, attributes, tigranes, military, failure, to, his, excessive, reliance, on, his, cavalry, according, to, one, count, 24, operas, have, been, composed, about, tigranes, by, european, composers, including, by, prominent, italian, and, german, composers, such, as, alessandro, scarlatti, tigrane, 1715, antonio, vivaldi, la, virtu, trionfante, dell, amore, e, dell, odio, ovvero, il, tigrane, 1724, niccol, piccinni, tigrane, 1761, tomaso, albinoni, giovanni, bononcini, francesco, gasparini, pietro, alessandro, guglielmi, johann, adolph, hasse, giovanni, battista, lampugnani, vincenzo, righini, antonio, tozzi, and, others, according, to, razmik, panossian, tigranes, short, lived, empire, has, been, a, source, of, pride, for, modern, armenian, nationalists, the, phrase, sea, to, sea, armenia, armenian, tsovits, tsov, hayastan, is, a, popular, expression, used, by, armenians, to, refer, to, the, kingdom, of, tigranes, which, extended, from, the, caspian, sea, to, the, mediterranean, sea
