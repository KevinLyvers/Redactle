sent, to, the, augustinian, nuns, school, in, vila, after, completing, her, education, she, initially, resisted, the, idea, of, a, religious, vocation, but, after, a, stay, with, her, uncle, and,

nomenclature, as, oratio, recollectionis, she, also, dipped, into, other, mystical, ascetical, works, such, as, the, tractatus, de, oratione, et, meditatione, of, peter, of, alcantara, her, zeal, for, mortification, caused, her, to, become, ill, again, and, she, spent, almost, a, year, in, bed, causing, huge, worry, to, her, community, and, family, she, nearly, died, but, she, recovered, attributing, her, recovery, to, the, miraculous, intercession, of, saint, joseph, she, began, to, experience, bouts, of, religious, ecstasy, she, reported, that, during, her, illness, she, had, progressed, from, the, lowest, stage, of, recollection, to, the, devotions, of, silence, and, even, to, the, devotions, of, ecstasy, in, which, was, one, of, perceived, in, perfect, union, with, god, see, mysticism, she, said, she, frequently, experienced, the, rich, blessing, of, tears, during, this, final, stage, as, the, catholic, distinction, between, mortal, and, venial, sin, became, clear, to, her, she, came, to, understand, the, awful, horror, of, sin, and, the, inherent, nature, of, original, sin, she, also, became, conscious, of, her, own, natural, impotence, in, confronting, sin, and, the, need, for, absolute, surrender, to, god, around, the, same, time, she, received, a, copy, of, the, full, spanish, translation, of, augustine, of, hippo, s, autobiographical, work, confessions, which, helped, her, resolve, and, to, tend, to, her, own, bouts, of, religious, scruples, the, text, helped, her, realize, that, holiness, was, indeed, possible, and, she, found, solace, in, the, idea, that, such, a, great, saint, was, once, an, inveterate, sinner, in, her, autobiography, she, wrote, that, she, was, very, fond, of, st, augustine, for, he, was, a, sinner, too, around, 1556, friends, suggested, that, her, newfound, knowledge, could, be, of, diabolical, rather, than, divine, origin, she, had, begun, to, inflict, mortifications, of, the, flesh, upon, herself, but, her, confessor, the, jesuit, francis, borgia, reassured, her, of, the, divine, inspiration, of, her, thoughts, on, st, peter, s, day, in, 1559, teresa, became, firmly, convinced, that, jesus, christ, had, presented, himself, to, her, in, bodily, form, though, invisible, these, visions, lasted, almost, uninterruptedly, for, more, than, two, years, in, another, vision, the, famous, transverberation, a, seraph, drove, the, fiery, point, of, a, golden, lance, repeatedly, through, her, heart, causing, her, an, ineffable, spiritual, and, bodily, pain, i, saw, in, his, hand, a, long, spear, of, gold, and, at, the, point, there, seemed, to, be, a, little, fire, he, appeared, to, me, to, be, thrusting, it, at, times, into, my, heart, and, to, pierce, my, very, entrails, when, he, drew, it, out, he, seemed, to, draw, them, out, also, and, to, leave, me, all, on, fire, with, a, great, love, of, god, the, pain, was, so, great, that, it, made, me, moan, and, yet, so, surpassing, was, the, sweetness, of, this, excessive, pain, that, i, could, not, wish, to, be, rid, of, it, the, account, of, this, vision, was, the, inspiration, for, one, of, bernini, s, most, famous, works, the, ecstasy, of, saint, teresa, at, santa, maria, della, vittoria, in, rome, although, based, in, part, on, teresa, s, description, of, her, mystical, transverberation, in, her, autobiography, bernini, s, depiction, of, the, event, is, considered, by, some, to, be, highly, eroticized, especially, when, compared, to, the, entire, preceding, artistic, teresian, tradition, the, memory, of, this, episode, served, as, an, inspiration, throughout, the, rest, of, her, life, and, motivated, her, lifelong, imitation, of, the, life, and, suffering, of, jesus, epitomized, in, the, adage, often, associated, with, her, lord, either, let, me, suffer, or, let, me, die, teresa, who, became, a, celebrity, in, her, town, dispensing, wisdom, from, behind, the, convent, grille, was, known, for, her, raptures, which, sometimes, involved, levitation, it, was, a, source, of, embarrassment, to, her, and, she, bade, her, sisters, hold, her, down, when, this, occurred, subsequently, historians, neurologists, and, psychiatrists, like, peter, fenwick, and, javier, lvarez, rodr, guez, among, others, have, taken, an, interest, in, her, symptomatology, the, fact, that, she, wrote, down, virtually, everything, that, happened, to, her, during, her, religious, life, means, that, an, invaluable, and, exceedingly, rare, medical, record, from, the, 16th, century, has, been, preserved, examination, of, this, record, has, led, to, the, speculative, conclusion, that, she, may, have, suffered, from, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, over, time, teresa, found, herself, increasingly, at, odds, with, the, spiritual, malaise, prevailing, in, her, convent, of, the, incarnation, among, the, 150, nuns, living, there, the, observance, of, cloister, designed, to, protect, and, strengthen, spiritual, practice, and, prayer, became, so, lax, that, it, appeared, to, lose, its, purpose, the, daily, invasion, of, visitors, many, of, high, social, and, political, rank, disturbed, the, atmosphere, with, frivolous, concerns, and, vacuous, conversation, such, intrusions, in, the, solitude, essential, to, develop, and, sustain, contemplative, prayer, so, grieved, teresa, that, she, longed, to, intervene, the, incentive, to, take, the, practical, steps, inspired, by, her, inward, motivation, was, supported, by, the, franciscan, priest, peter, of, alcantara, who, met, her, early, in, 1560, and, became, her, spiritual, adviser, she, resolved, to, found, a, reformed, carmelite, convent, correcting, the, laxity, which, she, had, found, at, the, incarnation, convent, and, elsewhere, besides, do, a, guiomar, of, ulloa, a, friend, was, granted, permission, for, the, project, the, abject, poverty, of, the, new, convent, established, in, 1562, and, named, st, joseph, s, san, jos, at, first, caused, a, scandal, among, the, citizens, and, authorities, of, vila, and, the, small, house, with, its, chapel, was, in, peril, of, suppression, however, powerful, patrons, including, the, local, bishop, coupled, with, the, impression, of, well, ordered, subsistence, and, purpose, turned, animosity, into, approval, in, march, 1563, after, teresa, had, moved, to, the, new, convent, house, she, received, papal, sanction, for, her, primary, principles, of, absolute, poverty, and, renunciation, of, ownership, of, property, which, she, proceeded, to, formulate, into, a, constitution, her, plan, was, the, revival, of, the, earlier, stricter, monastic, rules, supplemented, by, new, regulations, including, the, three, disciplines, of, ceremonial, flagellation, prescribed, for, the, divine, office, every, week, and, the, discalceation, of, the, religious, for, the, first, five, years, teresa, remained, in, seclusion, mostly, engaged, in, prayer, and, writing, in, 1567, teresa, received, a, patent, from, the, carmelite, general, rubeo, de, ravenna, to, establish, further, houses, of, the, new, order, this, process, required, many, visitations, and, long, journeys, across, nearly, all, the, provinces, of, spain, she, left, a, record, of, the, arduous, project, in, her, libro, de, las, fundaciones, between, 1567, and, 1571, reformed, convents, were, established, at, medina, del, campo, malag, n, valladolid, toledo, pastrana, salamanca, and, alba, de, tormes, as, part, of, the, original, patent, teresa, was, given, permission, to, set, up, two, houses, for, men, who, wished, to, adopt, the, reforms, she, convinced, two, carmelite, friars, john, of, the, cross, and, anthony, of, jesus, to, help, with, this, they, founded, the, first, monastery, of, discalced, carmelite, brothers, in, november, 1568, at, duruelo, another, friend, of, teresa, jer, nimo, graci, n, the, carmelite, visitator, of, the, older, observance, of, andalusia, and, apostolic, commissioner, and, later, provincial, of, the, teresian, order, gave, her, powerful, support, in, founding, monasteries, at, segovia, 1571, beas, de, segura, 1574, seville, 1575, and, caravaca, de, la, cruz, murcia, 1576, meanwhile, john, of, the, cross, promoted, the, inner, life, of, the, movement, through, his, power, as, a, teacher, and, preacher, in, 1576, unreformed, members, of, the, carmelite, order, began, to, persecute, teresa, her, supporters, and, her, reforms, following, a, number, of, resolutions, adopted, at, the, general, chapter, at, piacenza, the, governing, body, of, the, order, forbade, all, further, founding, of, reformed, convents, the, general, chapter, instructed, her, to, go, into, voluntary, retirement, at, one, of, her, institutions, she, obeyed, and, chose, st, joseph, s, at, toledo, meanwhile, her, friends, and, associates, were, subjected, to, further, attacks, several, years, later, her, appeals, by, letter, to, king, philip, ii, of, spain, secured, relief, as, a, result, in, 1579, the, cases, before, the, inquisition, against, her, graci, n, and, others, were, dropped, this, allowed, the, reform, to, resume, an, edict, from, pope, gregory, xiii, allowed, the, appointment, of, a, special, provincial, for, the, newer, branch, of, the, carmelite, religious, and, a, royal, decree, created, a, protective, board, of, four, assessors, for, the, reform, during, the, last, three, years, of, her, life, teresa, founded, convents, at, villanueva, de, la, jara, in, northern, andalusia, 1580, palencia, 1580, soria, 1581, burgos, and, granada, 1582, in, total, seventeen, convents, all, but, one, founded, by, her, and, as, many, men, s, monasteries, were, owed, to, her, reforms, over, twenty, years, her, final, illness, overtook, her, on, one, of, her, journeys, from, burgos, to, alba, de, tormes, she, died, in, 1582, just, as, catholic, europe, was, making, the, switch, from, the, julian, to, the, gregorian, calendar, which, required, the, excision, of, the, dates, of, 5, 14, october, from, the, calendar, she, died, either, before, midnight, of, 4, october, or, early, in, the, morning, of, 15, october, which, is, celebrated, as, her, feast, day, according, to, the, liturgical, calendar, then, in, use, she, died, on, the, 15th, her, last, words, were, my, lord, it, is, time, to, move, on, well, then, may, your, will, be, done, o,

occupying, ottoman, turks, from, whom, he, had, to, redeem, it, with, a, few, rings, and, 20, reales, the, body, was, exhumed, again, on, 25, november, 1585, to, be, moved, to, vila, and, found, to, be, incorrupt, an, arm, was, removed, and, left, in, alba, de, tormes, at, the, nuns, request, to, compensate, for, losing, the, main, relic, of, teresa, but, the, rest, of, the, body, was, reburied, in, the, discalced, carmelite, chapter, house, in, vila, the, removal, was, done, without, the, approval, of, the, duke, of, alba, de, tormes, and, he, brought, the, body, back, in, 1586, with, pope,

had, granted, her, the, title, doctor, ecclesiae, latin, for, doctor, of, the, church, with, a, diploma, in, her, lifetime, but, that, title, is, distinct, from, the, papal, honour, of, doctor, of, the, church, which, is, always, conferred, posthumously, the, latter, was, finally, bestowed, upon, her, by, pope, paul, vi, on, 27, september, 1970, along, with, catherine, of, siena, making, them, the, first, women, to, be, awarded, the, distinction, teresa, is, revered, as, the, doctor, of, prayer, the, mysticism, in, her, works, exerted, a, formative, influence, upon, many, theologians, of, the, following, centuries, such, as, francis, of, sales, f, nelon, and, the, port, royalists, in, 1670, her, coffin, was, plated, in, silver, teresa, of, avila, is, honored, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, on, 15, october, in, 1626, at, the, request, of, philip, iv, of, spain, the, castilian, parliament, elected, teresa, without, lacking, one, vote, as, copatron, saint, of, castile, this, status, was, affirmed, by, pope, urban, viii, in, a, brief, issued, on, 21, july, 1627, in, which, he, stated, for, these, reasons, and, for, the, great, devotion, which, they, have, for, teresa, they, elected, her, for, patron, and, advocate, of, these, kingdoms, in, the, last, cortes, of, the, aforementioned, kingdoms, and, because, the, representatives, in, the, cortes, desired, it, so, greatly, that, their, vote, be, firm, and, perpetual, we, grant, it, our, patronage, and, the, approval, of, the, holy, apostolic, see, more, broadly, the, 1620s, the, entirety, of, spain, castile, and, beyond, debated, who, should, be, the, country, s, patron, saint, the, choices, were, either, the, current, patron, james, matamoros, or, a, pairing, of, him, and, the, newly, canonised, saint, teresa, of, vila, teresa, s, promoters, said, spain, faced, newer, challenges, especially, the, threat, of, protestantism, and, societal, decline, at, home, thus, needing, a, more, contemporary, patron, who, understood, those, issues, and, could, guide, the, spanish, nation, santiago, s, supporters, santiaguistas, fought, back, and, eventually, won, the, argument, but, teresa, of, vila, remained, far, more, popular, at, the, local, level, james, the, great, kept, the, title, of, patron, saint, for, the, spanish, people, and, the, most, blessed, virgin, mary, under, the, title, immaculate, conception, as, the, sole, patroness, for, the, entire, spanish, kingdom, the, spanish, nuns, who, established, carmel, in, france, brought, a, devotion, to, the, infant, jesus, with, them, and, it, became, widespread, in, france, though, there, are, no, written, historical, accounts, establishing, that, teresa, of, vila, ever, owned, the, famous, infant, jesus, of, prague, statue, according, to, tradition, such, a, statue, is, said, to, have, been, in, her, possession, and, teresa, is, reputed, to, have, given, it, to, a, noblewoman, travelling, to, prague, the, age, of, the, statue, dates, to, approximately, the, same, time, as, teresa, it, has, been, thought, that, teresa, carried, a, portable, statue, of, the, child, jesus, wherever, she, went, the, idea, circulated, by, the, early, 1700s, the, autobiography, la, vida, de, la, santa, madre, teresa, de, jes, s, the, life, of, the, holy, mother, teresa, of, jesus, was, written, at, avila, between, 1562, and, 1565, but, published, posthumously, editions, include, the, way, of, perfection, spanish, camino, de, perfecci, n, was, published, in, 1566, teresa, called, this, a, living, book, and, in, it, set, out, to, teach, her, nuns, how, to, progress, through, prayer, and, christian, meditation, she, discusses, the, rationale, for, being, a, carmelite, and, the, rest, deals, with, the, purpose, of, and, approaches, to, spiritual, life, the, title, was, inspired, by, the, devotional, book, the, imitation, of, christ, 1418, which, had, become, a, favourite, expression, of, teresa, much, before, she, wrote, this, work, as, it, appeared, at, several, places, in, her, autobiography, the, life, of, teresa, of, jesus, like, her, other, books, the, way, of, perfection, was, written, on, the, advice, of, her, counsellors, to, describe, her, experiences, in, prayer, during, the, period, when, the, reformation, was, spreading, through, europe, herein, she, describes, ways, of, attaining, spiritual, perfection, through, prayer, and, its, four, stages, as, in, meditation, quiet, repose, of, soul, and, finally, perfect, union, with, god, which, she, equates, with, rapture, the, interior, castle, or, the, mansions, spanish, el, castillo, interior, or, las, moradas, was, written, in, 1577, and, published, in, 1588, it, contained, the, basis, for, what, she, felt, should, be, the, ideal, journey, of, faith, comparing, the, contemplative, soul, to, a, castle, with, seven, successive, interior, courts, or, chambers, analogous, to, the, seven, mansions, the, work, was, inspired, by, her, vision, of, the, soul, as, a, diamond, in, the, shape, of, a, castle, containing, seven, mansions, which, she, interpreted, as, the, journey, of, faith, through, seven, stages, ending, with, union, with, god, fray, diego, one, of, teresa, s, former, confessors, wrote, that, god, revealed, to, teresa, a, most, beautiful, crystal, globe, made, in, the, shape, of, a, castle, and, containing, seven, mansions, in, the, seventh, and, innermost, of, which, was, the, king, of, glory, in, the, greatest, splendour, illumining, and, beautifying, them, all, the, nearer, one, got, to, the, centre, the, stronger, was, the, light, outside, the, palace, limits, everything, was, foul, dark, and, infested, with, toads, vipers, and, other, venomous, creatures, christia, mercer, columbia, university, philosophy, professor, claims, that, the, seventeenth, century, frenchman, ren, descartes, lifted, some, of, his, most, influential, ideas, from, teresa, of, vila, who, fifty, years, before, descartes, wrote, popular, books, about, the, role, of, philosophical, reflection, in, intellectual, growth, she, describes, a, number, of, striking, similarities, between, descartes, s, seminal, work, meditations, on, first, philosophy, and, teresa, s, interior, castle, st, teresa, s, mystical, experiences, have, inspired, several, authors, in, modern, times, but, not, necessarily, from, teresa, s, christian, theological, perspective, the, prayer, nada, te, turbe, let, nothing, disturb, you, is, attributed, to, teresa, having, been, found, within, her, breviary, let, nothing, disturb, you, let, nothing, make, you, afraid, all, things, are, passing, god, alone, never, changes, patience, gains, all, things, if, you, have, god, you, will, want, for, nothing, god, alone, suffices, the, ultimate, preoccupation, of, teresa, s, mystical, thought, as, consistently, reflected, in, her, writings, is, the, ascent, of, the, soul, to, god, aumann, notes, that, the, grades, of, prayer, described, in, the, life, do, not, correspond, to, the, division, of, prayer, commonly, given, in, the, manuals, of, spiritual, life, due, to, the, fact, that, st, teresa, did, not, write, a, systematic, theology, of, prayer, according, to, zimmerman, in, all, her, writings, on, this, subject, she, deals, with, her, personal, experiences, there, is, no, vestige, in, her, writings, of, any, influence, of, the, areopagite, the, patristic, or, the, scholastic, mystical, schools, as, represented, among, others, by, the, german, dominican, mystics, she, is, intensely, personal, her, system, going, exactly, as, far, as, her, experiences, but, not, a, step, further, teresa, describes, in, the, interior, castle, that, the, treasure, of, heaven, lies, buried, within, our, hearts, and, that, there, is, an, interior, part, of, the, heart, which, is, the, centre, of, the, soul, in, her, autobiography, she, describes, four, stages, in, which, she, uses, the, image, of, watering, one, s, garden, as, a, metaphor, for, mystical, prayer, the, interior, castle, is, divided, into, seven, mansions, also, called, dwelling, places, each, level, describing, a, step, to, get, closer, to, god, in, her, work, teresa, already, assumed, entrance, into, the, first, mansions, by, prayer, and, meditation, the, purgative, stage, involving, active, prayer, and, asceticism, the, illuminative, stage, the, beginning, of, mystical, or, contemplative, or, supernatural, prayer, unitive, stage, some, scholars, have, compared, the, seven, mansions, to, the, seven, chakras, in, hindu, culture, the, first, four, grades, of, teresa, s, classifications, of, prayer, belong, to, the, ascetical, stage, of, spiritual, life, these, are, vocal, prayer, meditational, or, mental, prayer, affective, prayer, and, acquired, or, natural, recollection, according, to, augustin, poulain, and, robert, thouless, teresa, described, four, degrees, or, stages, of, mystical, union, namely, the, prayer, of, quiet, full, or, semi, ecstatic, union, ecstatic, union, or, ecstasy, and, transforming, or, deifying, union, or, spiritual, marriage, properly, of, the, soul, with, god, while, augustin, poulain, and, robert, thouless, do, not, mention, the, prayer, of, supernatural, or, passive, recollection, as, a, separate, stage, aumann, discerns, infused, contemplation, as, a, separate, stage, in, the, fourth, mansion, of, the, interior, castle, together, these, five, grades, are, infused, prayer, and, belong, to, the, mystical, phase, of, spiritual, life, thomas, merton, disagrees, on, a, fine, cut, distinction, between, acquired, contemplation, and, the, prayer, of, quiet, noticing, the, carmelite, tendency, of, systematization, whereas, teresa, herself, was, just, describing, her, personal, experiences, commenting, on, teresa, s, writings, and, the, scholarly, discussions, on, the, precise, stages, thomas, merton, comments, with, all, these, divisions, and, distinctions, comings, and, goings, and, varieties, of, terms, one, tends, to, become, impatient, with, the, saint, aumann, synthesizes, teresa, s, writings, into, nine, grades, of, prayer, mental, prayer, is, a, form, of, prayer, performed, without, aid, of, any, particular, formula, it, is, distinguished, from, vocal, prayers, prayers, performed, by, means, of, a, given, formula, prayer, is, mental, when, the, thoughts, and, affections, of, the, soul, are, not, expressed, in, a, previously, determined, formula, according, to, teresa, of, vila, mental, prayer, is, meditational, prayer, in, which, the, person, is, like, a, gardener, who, with, much, labour, draws, the, water, up, from, the, depths, of, the, well, to, water, the, plants, and, flowers, according, to, teresa, of, avila, mental, prayer, can, proceed, by, using, vocal, prayers, in, order, to, improve, dialogue, with, god, according, to, lehodey, mental, prayer, can, be, divided, into, meditation, more, active, in, reflections, and, contemplation, more, quiet, and, gazeful, for, teresa, of, avila, in, natural, or, acquired, contemplation, also, called, the, prayer, of, simplicity, there, is, one, dominant, thought, or, sentiment, which, recurs, constantly, and, easily, although, with, little, or, no, development, amid, many, other, thoughts, beneficial, or, otherwise, the, prayer, of, simplicity, often, has, a, tendency, to, simplify, itself, even, in, respect, to, its, object, leading, one, to, think, chiefly, of, god, and, of, his, presence, but, in, a, confused, manner, in, the, words, of, saint, alphonsus, maria, de, liguori, acquired, contemplation, consists, in, seeing, at, a, simple, glance, the, truths, which, could, previously, be, discovered, only, through, prolonged, discourse, reasoning, is, largely, replaced, by, intuition, and, affections, and, resolutions, though, not, absent, are, only, slightly, varied, and, expressed, in, a, few, words, similarly, saint, ignatius, of, loyola, in, his, 30, day, retreat, or, spiritual, exercises, beginning, in, the, second, week, with, its, focus, on, the, life, of, jesus, describes, less, reflection, and, more, simple, contemplation, on, the, events, of, jesus, life, these, contemplations, consist, mainly, in, a, simple, gaze, and, include, an, application, of, the, senses, to, the, events, 121, to, further, one, s, empathy, for, jesus, values, to, love, him, more, and, to, follow, him, more, closely, 104, definitions, similar, to, that, of, saint, alphonsus, maria, de, liguori, are, given, by, adolphe, tanquerey, a, simple, gaze, on, god, and, divine, things, proceeding, from, love, and, tending, thereto, and, saint, francis, de, sales, a, loving, simple, and, permanent, attentiveness, of, the, mind, to, divine, things, natural, or, acquired, contemplation, has, been, compared, to, the, attitude, of, a, mother, watching, over, the, cradle, of, her, child, she, thinks, lovingly, of, the, child, without, reflection, and, amid, interruptions, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, what, is, contemplative, prayer, st, teresa, answers, contemplative, prayer, in, my, opinion, is, nothing, else, than, a, close, sharing, between, friends, it, means, taking, time, frequently, to, be, alone, with, him, who, we, know, loves, us, contemplative, prayer, seeks, him, whom, my, soul, loves, it, is, jesus, and, in, him, the, father, we, seek, him, because, to, desire, him, is, always, the, beginning, of, love, and, we, seek, him, in, that, pure, faith, which, causes, us, to, be, born, of, him, and, to, live, in, him, in, this, inner, prayer, we, can, still, meditate, but, our, attention, is, fixed, on, the, lord, himself, according, to, hardon, infused, contemplation, is, a, supernatural, gift, by, which, a, person, s, mind, and, will, become, totally, centered, on, god, under, this, influence, the, intellect, receives, special, insights, into, things, of, the, spirit, and, the, affections, are, extraordinarily, animated, with, divine, love, infused, contemplation, assumes, the, free, co, operation, of, the, human, will, according, to, poulain, it, is, a, form, of, mystical, union, with, god, a, union, characterized, by, the, fact, that, it, is, god, and, god, only, who, manifests, himself, according, to, poulain, mystical, grace, may, also, manifest, as, visions, of, the, humanity, of, christ, or, an, angel, or, revelations, of, a, future, event, and, include, miraculous, bodily, phenomena, sometimes, observed, in, ecstatics, in, teresa, s, mysticism, infused, contemplation, is, described, as, a, divinely, originated, general, non, conceptual, loving, awareness, of, god, according, to, dubay, it, is, a, wordless, awareness, and, love, that, we, of, ourselves, cannot, initiate, or, prolong, the, beginnings, of, this, contemplation, are, brief, and, frequently, interrupted, by, distractions, the, reality, is, so, unimposing, that, one, who, lacks, instruction, can, fail, to, appreciate, what, exactly, is, taking, place, initial, infused, prayer, is, so, ordinary, and, unspectacular, in, the, early, stages, that, many, fail, to, recognize, it, for, what, it, is, yet, with, generous, people, that, is, with, those, who, try, to, live, the, whole, gospel, wholeheartedly, and, who, engage, in, an, earnest, prayer, life, it, is, common, according, to, thomas, dubay, infused, contemplation, is, the, normal, ordinary, development, of, discursive, prayer, mental, prayer, meditative, prayer, which, it, gradually, replaces, dubay, considers, infused, contemplation, as, common, only, among, those, who, try, to, live, the, whole, gospel, wholeheartedly, and, who, engage, in, an, earnest, prayer, life, other, writers, view, contemplative, prayer, in, its, infused, supernatural, form, as, far, from, common, john, baptist, scaramelli, reacting, in, the, 17th, century, against, quietism, taught, that, asceticism, and, mysticism, are, two, distinct, paths, to, perfection, the, former, being, the, normal, ordinary, end, of, the, christian, life, and, the, latter, something, extraordinary, and, very, rare, jordan, aumann, considered, that, this, idea, of, the, two, paths, was, an, innovation, in, spiritual, theology, and, a, departure, from, the, traditional, catholic, teaching, and, jacques, maritain, proposed, that, one, should, not, say, that, every, mystic, necessarily, enjoys, habitual, infused, contemplation, in, the, mystical, state, since, the, gifts, of, the, holy, spirit, are, not, limited, to, intellectual, operations, for, teresa, of, avila, the, prayer, of, quiet, is, a, state, in, which, the, soul, experiences, an, extraordinary, peace, and, rest, accompanied, by, delight, or, pleasure, in, contemplating, god, as, present, according, to, poulain, mystical, union, will, be, called, spiritual, quiet, when, the, divine, action, is, still, too, weak, to, prevent, distractions, in, a, word, when, the, imagination, still, retains, a, certain, liberty, according, to, poulain, in, incomplete, mystical, union, or, the, prayer, of, quiet, or, supernatural, recollection, the, action, of, god, is, not, strong, enough, to, prevent, distractions, and, the, imagination, still, retains, a, certain, liberty, according, to, poulain, mystical, union, will, be, called, full, union, when, its, strength, is, so, great, that, the, soul, is, fully, occupied, with, the, divine, object, whilst, on, the, other, hand, the, senses, continue, to, act, under, these, conditions, by, making, a, greater, or, less, effort, one, can, cease, from, prayer, according, to, poulain, mystical, union, will, be, called, ecstasy, when, communications, with, the, external, world, are, severed, or, nearly, so, in, this, event, one, can, no, longer, make, voluntary, movement, nor, energy, from, the, state, at, will, the, transforming, union, differs, from, the, other, three, specifically, and, not, merely, in, intensity, according, to, poulain, it, consists, in, the, habitual, consciousness, of, a, mysterious, grace, which, all, shall, possess, in, heaven, the, anticipation, of, the, divine, nature, the, soul, is, conscious, of, the, divine, assistance, in, its, superior, supernatural, operations, those, of, the, intellect, and, the, will, spiritual, marriage, differs, from, spiritual, espousals, inasmuch, as, the, first, of, these, states, is, permanent, and, the, second, only, transitory, portrayals, of, teresa, include, the, following, theresa, is, usually, shown, in, the, habit, of, the, discalced, carmelites, and, writing, in, a, book, with, a, quill, pen, sometimes, there, is, a, dove, symbolizing, the, holy, spirit, this, article, was,
