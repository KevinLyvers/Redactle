writers, of, the, period, but, he, was, also, a, poet, himself, if, not, one, of, particular, ability, francis, worked, diligently, at, improving, the, royal, library, he, appointed, the, great, french, humanist, guillaume, bud, as, chief, librarian, and, began, to, expand, the, collection, francis, employed, agents, in, italy, to, look, for, rare, books, and, manuscripts, just, as, he, had, agents, looking, for, artworks, during, his, reign, the, size, of, the, library, greatly, increased, not, only, did, he, expand, the, library, but, there, is, also, evidence, that, he, read, the, books, he, bought, for, it, a, much, rarer, event, in, the, royal, annals, francis, set, an, important, precedent, by, opening, his, library, to, scholars, from, around, the, world, in, order, to, facilitate, the, diffusion, of, knowledge, in, 1537, francis, signed, the, ordonnance, de, montpellier, which, decreed, that, his, library, be, given, a, copy, of, every, book, to, be, sold, in, france, francis, older, sister, marguerite, queen, of, navarre, was, an, accomplished, writer, who, produced, the, classic, collection, of, short, stories, known, as, the, heptameron, francis, corresponded, with, the, abbess, and, philosopher, claude, de, bectoz, of, whose, letters, he, was, so, fond, that, he, would, carry, them, around, and, show, them, to, the, ladies, of, his, court, together, with, his, sister, he, visited, her, in, tarascon, francis, poured, vast, amounts, of, money, into, new, structures, he, continued, the, work, of, his, predecessors, on, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, and, also, started, renovations, on, the, ch, teau, de, blois, early, in, his, reign, he, began, construction, of, the, magnificent, ch, teau, de, chambord, inspired, by, the, architectural, styles, of, the, italian, renaissance, and, perhaps, even, designed, by, leonardo, da, vinci, francis, rebuilt, the, louvre, palace, transforming, it, from, a, medieval, fortress, into, a, building, of, renaissance, splendour, he, financed, the, building, of, a, new, city, hall, the, h, tel, de, ville, for, paris, in, order, to, have, control, over, the, building, s, design, he, constructed, the, ch, teau, de, madrid, in, the, bois, de, boulogne, and, rebuilt, the, ch, teau, de, saint, germain, en, laye, the, largest, of, francis, building, projects, was, the, reconstruction, and, expansion, of, the, ch, teau, de, fontainebleau, which, quickly, became, his, favourite, place, of, residence, as, well, as, the, residence, of, his, official, mistress, anne, duchess, of, tampes, although, the, italian, wars, 1494, 1559, came, to, dominate, the, reign, of, francis, i, which, he, constantly, participated, in, at, the, forefront, as, le, roi, chevalier, the, wars, were, not, the, sole, focus, of, his, policies, he, merely, continued, the, wars, that, he, succeeded, from, his, predecessors, and, that, his, heir, and, successor, on, the, throne, henry, ii, of, france, would, inherit, after, francis, death, indeed, the, italian, wars, had, begun, when, milan, sent, a, plea, to, king, charles, viii, of, france, for, protection, against, the, aggressive, actions, of, the, king, of, naples, militarily, and, diplomatically, the, reign, of, francis, i, was, a, mixed, bag, of, success, and, failure, francis, tried, and, failed, to, become, holy, roman, emperor, at, the, imperial, election, of, 1519, primarily, due, to, his, adversary, charles, having, threatened, the, electors, with, violence, however, there, were, also, temporary, victories, such, as, in, the, portion, of, the, italian, wars, called, the, war, of, the, league, of, cambrai, 1508, 1516, and, more, specifically, to, the, final, stage, of, that, war, which, history, refers, to, simply, as, francis, first, italian, war, 1515, 1516, when, francis, routed, the, combined, forces, of, the, papal, states, and, the, old, swiss, confederacy, at, marignano, on, 13, 15, september, 1515, this, grand, victory, at, marignano, allowed, francis, to, capture, the, italian, city, state, of, duchy, of, milan, however, in, november, 1521, during, the, four, years, war, 1521, 1526, francis, was, forced, to, abandon, milan, in, the, face, of, the, advancing, imperial, forces, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, open, revolt, within, the, duchy, much, of, the, military, activity, of, francis, s, reign, was, focused, on, his, sworn, enemy, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, francis, and, charles, maintained, an, intense, personal, rivalry, charles, in, fact, brashly, dared, to, challenge, francis, to, single, combat, multiple, times, in, addition, to, the, holy, roman, empire, charles, personally, ruled, spain, austria, and, a, number, of, smaller, possessions, neighbouring, france, he, was, thus, a, constant, threat, to, francis, i, s, kingdom, francis, i, attempted, to, arrange, an, alliance, with, henry, viii, at, the, famous, meeting, at, the, field, of, cloth, of, gold, on, 7, june, 1520, but, despite, a, lavish, fortnight, of, diplomacy, they, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, francis, and, henry, viii, both, shared, the, dreams, of, power, and, chivalric, glory, however, their, relationship, featured, intense, personal, and, dynastic, rivalry, francis, was, driven, by, his, intense, eagerness, to, retake, milan, despite, the, strong, opposition, of, other, powers, henry, viii, was, likewise, determined, to, recapture, northern, france, which, francis, could, not, allow, however, the, situation, was, grave, francis, had, to, face, not, only, the, whole, might, of, western, europe, but, also, internal, hostility, in, the, form, of, charles, iii, de, bourbon, a, capable, commander, who, fought, alongside, francis, as, his, constable, at, the, great, battle, of, marignano, but, defected, to, charles, v, after, his, conflict, with, francis, mother, over, inheritance, of, bourbon, estates, despite, all, this, the, kingdom, of, france, still, held, the, balance, of, power, in, its, favour, nevertheless, the, defeat, suffered, from, the, cataclystic, battle, of, pavia, on, 24, february, 1525, during, part, of, the, continuing, italian, wars, known, as, the, four, years, war, upheaved, the, political, ground, of, europe, he, was, actually, taken, prisoner, cesare, hercolani, injured, his, horse, and, francis, himself, was, subsequently, captured, by, charles, de, lannoy, some, claim, he, was, captured, by, diego, d, vila, alonso, pita, da, veiga, and, juan, de, urbieta, from, guip, zcoa, for, this, reason, hercolani, was, named, victor, of, the, battle, of, pavia, zuppa, alla, pavese, was, supposedly, invented, on, the, spot, to, feed, the, captive, king, after, the, battle, francis, was, held, captive, morbidly, in, madrid, in, a, letter, to, his, mother, he, wrote, of, all, things, nothing, remains, to, me, but, honour, and, life, which, is, safe, this, line, has, come, down, in, history, famously, as, all, is, lost, save, honour, francis, was, compelled, to, make, major, concessions, to, charles, in, the, treaty, of, madrid, 1526, signed, on, 14, january, before, he, was, freed, on, 17, march, an, ultimatum, from, ottoman, sultan, suleiman, to, charles, additionally, played, a, role, in, his, release, francis, was, forced, to, surrender, any, claims, to, naples, and, milan, in, italy, francis, was, forced, to, recognised, the, independence, of, the, duchy, of, burgundy, which, had, been, part, of, france, since, the, death, of, charles, the, bold, in, 1477, and, finally, francis, was, betrothed, to, charles, sister, eleanor, francis, returned, to, france, in, exchange, for, his, two, sons, francis, and, henry, duke, of, orl, ans, the, future, henry, ii, of, france, but, once, he, was, free, he, revoked, the, forced, concessions, as, his, agreement, with, charles, was, made, under, duress, he, also, proclaimed, that, the, agreement, was, void, because, his, sons, were, taken, hostage, with, the, implication, that, his, word, alone, could, not, be, trusted, thus, he, firmly, repudiated, it, a, renewed, alliance, with, england, enabled, francis, to, repudiate, the, treaty, of, madrid, francis, persevered, in, his, rivalry, against, charles, and, his, intent, to, control, italy, by, the, mid, 1520s, pope, clement, vii, wished, to, liberate, italy, from, foreign, domination, especially, that, of, charles, so, he, allied, with, venice, to, form, the, league, of, cognac, francis, joined, the, league, in, may, 1526, in, the, war, of, the, league, of, cognac, of, 1526, 30, francis, allies, proved, weak, and, the, war, was, ended, by, the, treaty, of, cambrai, 1529, the, peace, of, the, ladies, negotiated, by, francis, mother, and, charles, aunt, the, two, princes, were, released, and, francis, married, eleanor, on, 24, july, 1534, francis, inspired, by, the, spanish, tercios, and, the, roman, legions, issued, an, edict, to, form, seven, infantry, l, gions, of, 6, 000, troops, each, of, which, 12, 000, of, 42, 000, were, arquebusiers, testifying, to, the, growing, importance, of, gunpowder, the, force, was, a, national, standing, army, where, any, soldier, could, be, promoted, on, the, basis, of, vacancies, were, paid, wages, by, grade, and, granted, exemptions, from, the, taille, and, other, taxes, up, to, 20, sous, a, heavy, burden, on, the, state, budget, after, the, league, of, cognac, failed, francis, concluded, a, secret, alliance, with, the, landgrave, of, hesse, on, 27, january, 1534, this, was, directed, against, charles, on, the, pretext, of, assisting, the, duke, of, w, rttemberg, to, regain, his, traditional, seat, from, which, charles, had, removed, him, in, 1519, francis, also, obtained, the, help, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, after, the, death, of, francesco, ii, sforza, ruler, of, milan, renewed, the, contest, in, italy, in, the, italian, war, of, 1536, 1538, this, round, of, fighting, which, had, little, result, was, ended, by, the, truce, of, nice, the, agreement, collapsed, however, which, led, to, francis, final, attempt, on, italy, in, the, italian, war, of, 1542, 1546, francis, i, managed, to, hold, off, the, forces, of, charles, and, henry, viii, charles, was, forced, to, sign, the, treaty, of, cr, py, because, of, his, financial, difficulties, and, conflicts, with, the, schmalkaldic, league, francis, had, been, much, aggrieved, at, the, papal, bull, aeterni, regis, in, june, 1481, portuguese, rule, over, africa, and, the, indies, was, confirmed, by, pope, sixtus, iv, thirteen, years, later, on, 7, june, 1494, portugal, and, the, crown, of, castille, signed, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, under, which, the, newly, discovered, lands, would, be, divided, between, the, two, signatories, all, this, prompted, francis, to, declare, the, sun, shines, for, me, as, it, does, for, others, i, would, very, much, like, to, see, the, clause, of, adam, s, will, by, which, i, should, be, denied, my, share, of, the, world, in, order, to, counterbalance, the, power, of, the, habsburg, empire, under, charles, v, especially, its, control, of, large, parts, of, the, new, world, through, the, crown, of, spain, francis, endeavoured, to, develop, contacts, with, the, new, world, and, asia, fleets, were, sent, to, the, americas, and, the, far, east, and, close, contacts, were,

the, ottoman, empire, and, to, set, up, instruction, in, the, arabic, language, under, the, guidance, of, guillaume, postel, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, a, watershed, moment, in, european, diplomacy, francis, came, to, an, understanding, with, the, ottoman, empire, that, developed, into, a, franco, ottoman, alliance, the, objective, for, francis, was, to, find, an, ally, against, the, house, of, habsburg, the, pretext, used, by, francis, was, the, protection, of, the, christians, in, ottoman, lands, the, alliance, has, been, called, the, first, nonideological, diplomatic, alliance, of, its, kind, between, a, christian, and, non, christian, empire, it, did, however, cause, quite, a, scandal, in, the, christian, world, and, was, designated, the, impious, alliance, or, the, sacrilegious, union, of, the, lily, and, the, crescent, nevertheless, it, endured, for, many, years, since, it, served, the, objective, interests, of, both, parties, the, two, powers, colluded,
