of, the, national, allegory, form, that, all, third, world, literature, takes, gloria, davies, compares, lu, xun, to, nietzsche, saying, that, both, were, trapped, in, the, construction, of, a, modernity, which, is, fundamentally, problematic, according, to, leonardo, vittorio, arena, lu, xun, cultivated, an, ambiguous, standpoint, towards, nietzsche, a, mixture, of, attraction, and,

the, missionary, writer, arthur, smith, his, disillusionment, with, politics, led, him, to, conclude, in, 1927, that, revolutionary, literature, alone, could, not, bring, about, radical, change,
