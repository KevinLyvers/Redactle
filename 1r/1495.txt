of, the, warring, states, in, ancient, china, about, 475, 221, bc, those, combat, combinations, had, specific, names, descriptions, and, classifications, sun, tzu, s, historicity, is, uncertain, the, han, dynasty, historian, sima, qian, and, other, traditional, chinese, historians, placed, him, as, a, minister, to, king, hel, of, wu, and, dated, his, lifetime, to, 544, 496, bc, modern, scholars, accepting, his, historicity, place, the, extant, text, of, the, art, of, war, in, the, later, warring, states, period, of, 475, to, 221, bc, based, on, its, style, of, composition, and, its, descriptions, of, warfare, traditional, accounts, state, that, the, general, s, descendant, sun, bin, wrote, a, treatise, on, military, tactics, also, titled, the, art, of, war, since, both, sun, wu, and, sun, bin, were, referred, to, as, sun, tzu, in, classical, chinese, texts, some, historians, believed, them, identical, prior, to, the, rediscovery, of, sun, bin, s, treatise, in, 1972, sun, tzu, s, work, has, been, praised, and, employed, throughout, the, arc, of, east, asian, military, history, since, its, composition, and, eventually, earned, global, attention, during, the, twentieth, century, the, art, of, war, grew, in, popularity, and, saw, practical, use, in, the, western, world, as, well, it, remains, influential, in, many, contemporary, competitive, endeavors, across, the, modern, world, beyond, military, strategy, and, warfare, including, espionage, culture, governance, business, and, sports, the, oldest, available, sources, disagree, as, to, where, sun, tzu, was, born, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, and, sima, qian, s, later, records, of, the, grand, historian, shiji, state, that, sun, tzu, was, born, in, qi, both, sources, also, agree, that, sun, tzu, was, born, in, the, late, spring, and, autumn, period, and, that, he, was, active, as, a, general, and, strategist, serving, king, hel, of, wu, in, the, sixth, century, bc, beginning, around, 512, bc, sun, tzu, s, victories, then, inspired, him, to, write, the, art, of, war, the, art, of, war, was, one, of, the, most, widely, read, military, treatises, in, the, subsequent, warring, states, period, a, time, of, constant, war, among, seven, ancient, chinese, states, zhao, qi, qin, chu, han, wei, and, yan, who, fought, to, control, the, vast, expanse, of, fertile, territory, in, eastern, china, one, of, the, better, known, stories, about, sun, tzu, taken, from, sima, qian, illustrates, sun, tzu, s, temperament, as, follows, before, hiring, sun, tzu, the, king, of, wu, tested, sun, tzu, s, skills, by, commanding, him, to, train, a, harem, of, 180, concubines, into, soldiers, sun, tzu, divided, them, into, two, companies, appointing, the, two, concubines, most, favored, by, the, king, as, the, company, commanders, when, sun, tzu, first, ordered, the, concubines, to, face, right, they, giggled, in, response, sun, tzu, said, that, the, general, in, this, case, himself, was, responsible, for, ensuring, that, soldiers, understood, the, commands, given, to, them, then, he, reiterated, the, command, and, again, the, concubines, giggled, sun, tzu, then, ordered, the, execution, of, the, king, s, two, favored, concubines, to, the, king, s, protests, he, explained, that, if, the, general, s, soldiers, understood, their, commands, but, did, not, obey, it, was, the, fault, of, the, officers, sun, tzu, also, said, that, once, a, general, was, appointed, it, was, his, duty, to, carry, out, his, mission, even, if, the, king, protested, after, both, concubines, were, killed, new, officers, were, chosen, to, replace, them, afterward, both, companies, now, well, aware, of, the, costs, of, further, frivolity, performed, their, maneuvers, flawlessly, sima, qian, claimed, that, sun, tzu, later, proved, on, the, battlefield, that, his, theories, were, effective, for, example, at, the, battle, of, boju, that, he, had, a, successful, military, career, and, that, he, wrote, the, art, of, war, based, on, his, tested, expertise, however, the, zuozhuan, a, historical, text, written, centuries, earlier, than, the, shiji, provides, a, much, more, detailed, account, of, the, battle, of, boju, but, does, not, mention, sun, tzu, at, all, around, the, 12th, century, ad, some, chinese, scholars, began, to, doubt, the, historical, existence, of, sun, tzu, primarily, on, the, grounds, that, he, is, not, mentioned, in, the, historical, classic, zuo, zhuan, which, mentions, most, of, the, notable, figures, from, the, spring, and, autumn, period, the, name, sun, wu, does, not, appear, in, any, text, prior, to, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, and, may, have, been, a, made, up, descriptive, cognomen, meaning, the, fugitive, warrior, the, surname, sun, can, be, glossed, as, the, related, term, fugitive, x, n, while, wu, is, the, ancient, chinese, virtue, of, martial, valiant, w, which, corresponds, to, sun, tzu, s, role, as, the, hero, s, doppelg, nger, in, the, story, of, wu, zixu, the, only, historical, battle, attributed, to, sun, tzu, the, battle, of, boju, has, no, record, of, him, fighting, in, that, battle, skeptics, cite, possible, historical, inaccuracies, and, anachronisms, in, the, text, and, that, the, book, was, actually, a, compilation, from, different, authors, and, military, strategists, attribution, of, the, authorship, of, the, art, of, war, varies, among, scholars, and, has, included, people, and, movements, including, sun, chu, scholar, wu, zixu, an, anonymous, author, a, school, of, theorists, in, qi, or, wu, sun, bin, and, others, sun, bin, appears, to, have, been, an, actual, person, who, was, a, genuine, authority, on, military, matters, and, may, have, been, the, inspiration, for, the, creation, of, the, historical, figure, sun, tzu, through, a, form, of, euhemerism, the, name, sun, wu, does, appear, in, later, sources, such, as, the, shiji, and, the, wu, yue, chunqiu, but, were, written, centuries, after, sun, tzu, s, era, the, use, of, the, strips, in, other, works, however, such, as, the, methods, of, the, sima, is, considered, proof, of, sun, tzu, s, historical, priority, according, to, ralph, sawyer, it, is, very, likely, sun, tzu, did, exist, and, not, only, served, as, a, general, but, also, wrote, the, core, of, the, book, that, bears, his, name, it, is, argued, that, there, is, a, disparity, between, the, large, scale, wars, and, sophisticated, techniques, detailed, in, the, text, and, the, more, primitive, small, scale, battles, that, many, believe, predominated, in, china, during, the, 6th, century, bc, against, this, sawyer, argues, that, the, teachings, of, sun, wu, were, probably, taught, to, succeeding, generations, in, his, family, or, a, small, school, of, disciples, which, eventually, included, sun, bin, these, descendants, or, students, may, have, revised, or, expanded, upon, certain, points, in, the, original, text, skeptics, who, identify, issues, with, the, traditionalist, view, point, to, possible, anachronisms, in, the, art, of, war, including, terms, technology, such, as, anachronistic, crossbows, philosophical, ideas, events, and, military, techniques, that, should, not, have, been, available, to, sun, wu, additionally, there, are, no, records, of, professional, generals, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, these, are, only, extant, from, the, warring, states, period, so, there, is, doubt, as, to, sun, tzu, s, rank, and, generalship, this, caused, much, confusion, as, to, when, the, art, of, war, was, actually, written, the, first, traditional, view, is, that, it, was, written, in, 512, bc, by, the, historical, sun, wu, active, in, the, last, years, of, the, spring, and, autumn, period, c, 722, 481, bc, a, second, view, held, by, scholars, such, as, samuel, griffith, places, the, art, of, war, during, the, middle, to, late, warring, states, period, c, 481, 221, bc, finally, a, third, school, claims, that, the, slips, were, published, in, the, last, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, this, is, based, on, how, its, adherents, interpret, the, bamboo, slips, discovered, at, yinque, shan, in, 1972, the, art, of, war, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, sun, tzu, it, presents, a, philosophy, of, war, for, managing, conflicts, and, winning, battles, it, is, accepted, as, a, masterpiece, on, strategy, and, has, been, frequently, cited, and, referred, to, by, generals, and, theorists, since, it, was, first, published, translated, and, distributed, internationally, there, are, numerous, theories, concerning, when, the, text, was, completed, and, concerning, the, identity, of, the, author, or, authors, but, archeological, recoveries, show, the, art, of, war, had, taken, roughly, its, current, form, by, at, least, the, early, han, period, because, it, is, impossible, to, prove, definitively, when, the, art, of, war, was, completed, before, this, date, the, differing, theories, concerning, the, work, s, author, or, authors, and, date, of, completion, are, unlikely, to, be, completely, resolved, some, modern, scholars, believe, that, it, contains, not, only, the, thoughts, of, its, original, author, but, also, commentary, and, clarifications, from, later, military, theorists, such, as, li, quan, and, du, mu, of, the, military, texts, written, before, the, unification, of, china, and, shi, huangdi, s, subsequent, book, burning, in, the, second, century, bc, six, major, works, have, survived, during, the, much, later, song, dynasty, these, six, works, were, combined, with, a, tang, text, into, a, collection, called, the, seven, military, classics, as, a, central, part, of, that, compilation, the, art, of, war, formed, the, foundations, of, orthodox, military, theory, in, early, modern, china, illustrating, this, point, the, book, was, required, reading, to, pass, the, tests, for, imperial, appointment, to, military, positions, sun, tzu, s, the, art, of, war, uses, language, that, may, be, unusual, in, a, western, text, on, warfare, and, strategy, for, example, the, eleventh, chapter, states, that, a, leader, must, be, serene, and, inscrutable, and, capable, of, comprehending, unfathomable, plans, the, text, contains, many, similar, remarks, that, have, long, confused, western, readers, lacking, an, awareness, of, the, east, asian, context, the, meanings, of, such, statements, are, clearer, when, interpreted, in, the, context, of, taoist, thought, and, practice, despite, its, title, the, art, of, war, addresses, strategy, in, a, broad, fashion, touching, upon, public, administration, and, planning, the, text, outlines, theories, of, battle, but, also, advocates, diplomacy, and, the, cultivation, of, relationships, with, other, nations, as, essential, to, the, health, of, a, state, as, such, the, book, has, also, become, popular, among, political, leaders, and, those, in, business, management, for, example, in, the, 1987, film, wall, street, the, protagonist, gordon, gekko, frequently, cites, passages, from, the, art, of, war, as, guiding, principles, for, his, aggressive, trading, techniques, on, 10, april, 1972, the, yinqueshan, han, tombs, were, accidentally, unearthed, by, construction, workers, in, shandong, scholars, uncovered, a, collection, of, ancient, texts, written, on, unusually, well, preserved, bamboo, slips, among, them, were, the, art, of, war, and, sun, bin, s, military, methods, although, han, dynasty, bibliographies, noted, the, latter, publication, as, extant, and, written, by, a, descendant, of, sun, it, had, previously, been, lost, the, rediscovery, of, sun, bin, s, work, is, regarded, as, extremely, important, by, scholars, both, because, of, sun, bin, s, relationship, to, sun, tzu, and, because, of, the, work, s, addition, to, the, body, of, military, thought, in, chinese, late, antiquity, the, discovery, as, a, whole, significantly, expanded, the, body, of, surviving, warring, states, military, theory, sun, bin, s, treatise, is, the, only, known, military, text, surviving, from, the, warring, states, period, discovered, in, the, twentieth, century, and, bears, the, closest, similarity, to, the, art, of, war, of, all, surviving, texts, sun, tzu, s, art, of, war, has, influenced, many, notable, figures, the, han, dynasty, historian, sima, qian, recounted, that, china, s, first, historical, emperor, qin, s, shi, huangdi, considered, the, book, invaluable, in, ending, the, time, of, the, warring, states, in, the, 20th, century, the, chinese, communist, leader, mao, zedong, partially, credited, his, 1949, victory, over, chiang, kai, shek, and, the, kuomintang, to, the, art, of, war, the, work, strongly, influenced, mao, s, writings, about, guerrilla, warfare, which, further, influenced, communist, insurgencies, around, the, world, the, art, of, war, was, introduced, into, nara, japan, in, c, ad, 760, and, the, book, quickly, became, popular, among, japanese, military, generals, through, its, later, influence, on, the, sengoku, period, great, unifiers, of, japan, oda, nobunaga, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, it, significantly, affected, the, unification, of, japan, in, the, early, modern, era, the, mastery, of, its, teachings, was, honored, among, the, samurai, and, its, teachings, were, both, exhorted, and, exemplified, by, influential, daimy, s, and, sh, guns, after, the, meiji, restoration, it, remained, popular, among, the, imperial, japanese, armed, forces, the, admiral, of, the, fleet, t, g, heihachir, who, led, japan, s, forces, to, victory, in, the, russo, japanese, war, was, an, avid, reader, of, sun, tzu, ho, chi, minh, translated, the, work, for, his, vietnamese, officers, to, study, his, general, v, nguy, n, gi,

are, obliged, to, prepare, short, papers, for, presentation, to, other, officers, on, their, readings, similarly, sun, tzu, s, art, of, war, is, listed, on, the, marine, corps, professional, reading, program, during, the, gulf, war, in, the, 1990s, both, generals, norman, schwarzkopf, jr, and, colin, powell, employed, principles, from, sun, tzu, related, to, deception, speed, and, striking, one, s, enemy, s, weak, points, however, the, united, states, and, other, western, countries, have, been, criticized, for, not, truly, understanding, sun, tzu, s, work, and, not, appreciating, the, art, of, war, within, the, wider, context, of, chinese, society, daoist, rhetoric, is, a, component, incorporated, in, the, art, of, war, according, to, steven, c, combs, in, sun, zi, and, the, art, of,
