japanese, lyrics, in, 2012, kraftwerk, have, been, recognized, as, pioneers, of, electronic, music, as, well, as, subgenres, such, as, electropop, art, pop, house, music, synth, pop, and, electronic, rock, in, its, early, incarnation, the, band, pursued, an, avant, garde, experimental, rock, style, inspired, by, the, compositions, of, karlheinz, stockhausen, h, tter, has, also, listed, the, beach, boys, as, a, major, influence, the, group, was, also, inspired, by, the, funk, music, of, james, brown, and, later, punk, rock, they, were, initially, connected, to, the, german, krautrock, scene, in, the, mid, 1970s, they, transitioned, to, an, electronic, sound, which, they, described, as, robot, pop, kraftwerk, s, lyrics, dealt, with, post, war, european, urban, life, and, technology, traveling, by, car, on, the, autobahn, traveling, by, train, using, home, computers, and, the, like, they, were, influenced, by, the, modernist, bauhaus, aesthetic, seeing, art, as, inseparable, from, everyday, function, usually, the, lyrics, are, very, minimal, but, reveal, both, an, innocent, celebration, of, and, a, knowing, caution, about, the, modern, world, as, well, as, playing, an, integral, role, in, the, rhythmic, structure, of, the, songs, many, of, kraftwerk, s, songs, express, the, paradoxical, nature, of, modern, urban, life, a, strong, sense, of, alienation, existing, side, by, side, with, a, celebration, of, the, joys, of, modern, technology, starting, with, the, release, of, autobahn, kraftwerk, began, to, release, a, series, of, concept, albums, radio, activity, trans, europe, express, the, man, machine, computer, world, tour, de, france, soundtracks, all, of, kraftwerk, s, albums, from, trans, europe, express, onwards, except, tour, de, france, soundtracks, have, been, released, in, separate, versions, one, with, german, vocals, for, sale, in, germany, switzerland, and, austria, and, one, with, english, vocals, for, the, rest, of, the, world, with, occasional, variations, in, other, languages, when, conceptually, appropriate, live, performance, has, always, played, an, important, part, in, kraftwerk, s, activities, also, despite, its, live, shows, generally, being, based, around, formal, songs, and, compositions, live, improvisation, often, plays, a, noticeable, role, in, its, performances, this, trait, can, be, traced, back, to, the, group, s, roots, in, the, first, experimental, krautrock, scene, of, the, late, 1960s, but, significantly, it, has, continued, to, be, a, part, of, its, playing, even, as, it, makes, ever, greater, use, of, digital, and, computer, controlled, sequencing, in, its, performances, some, of, the, band, s, familiar, compositions, have, been, observed, to, have, developed, from, live, improvisations, at, its, concerts, or, sound, checks, throughout, their, career, kraftwerk, have, pushed, the, limits, of, music, technology, with, some, notable, innovations, such, as, home, made, instruments, and, custom, built, devices, the, group, has, always, perceived, their, kling, klang, studio, as, a, complex, music, instrument, as, well, as, a, sound, laboratory, florian, schneider, in, particular, developed, a, fascination, with, music, technology, with, the, result, that, the, technical, aspects, of, sound, generation, and, recording, gradually, became, his, main, fields, of, activity, within, the, band, alexei, monroe, called, kraftwerk, the, first, successful, artists, to, incorporate, representations, of, industrial, sounds, into, non, academic, electronic, music, kraftwerk, used, a, custom, built, vocoder, on, their, albums, ralf, und, florian, and, autobahn, the, device, was, constructed, by, engineers, p, leunig, and, k, obermayer, of, the, physikalisch, technische, bundesanstalt, braunschweig, h, tter, and, schneider, received, a, patent, for, an, electronic, drum, kit, with, sensor, pads, filed, in, july, 1975, and, issued, in, june, 1977, it, must, be, hit, with, metal, sticks, which, are, connected, to, the, device, to, complete, a, circuit, that, triggers, analog, synthetic, percussion, sounds, the, band, first, performed, in, public, with, this, device, in, 1973, on, the, television, program, aspekte, on, the, all, german, channel, zweites, deutsches, fernsehen, where, it, was, played, by, wolfgang, fl, r, they, created, drum, machines, for, autobahn, and, trans, europe, express, on, the, radio, activity, tour, in, 1976, kraftwerk, tested, out, an, experimental, light, beam, activated, drum, cage, allowing, fl, r, to, trigger, electronic, percussion, through, arm, and, hand, movements, unfortunately, the, device, did, not, work, as, planned, and, it, was, quickly, abandoned, the, same, year, ralf, h, tter, and, florian, schneider, commissioned, bonn, based, synthesizerstudio, bonn, matten, wiechers, to, design, and, build, the, synthanorma, sequenzer, with, intervallomat, a, 4, 8, 2, 16, 1, 32, step, sequencer, system, with, some, features, that, commercial, products, couldn, t, provide, at, that, time, the, music, sequencer, was, used, by, the, band, for, the, first, time, to, control, the, electronic, sources, creating, the, rhythmic, sound, of, the, album, trans, europe, express, since, 2002, kraftwerk, s, live, performances, have, been, conducted, with, the, use, of, virtual, technology, i, e, software, replicating, and, replacing, original, analogue, or, digital, equipment, according, to, fritz, hilpert, the, mobility, of, music, technology, and, the, reliability, of, the, notebooks, and, software, have, greatly, simplified, the, realization, of, complex, touring, setups, we, generate, all, sounds, on, the, laptops, in, real, time, and, manipulate, them, with, controller, maps, it, takes, almost, no, time, to, get, our, compact, stage, system, set, up, for, performance, this, way, we, can, bring, our, kling, klang, studio, with, us, on, stage, the, physical, light, weight, of, our, equipment, also, translates, into, an, enormous, ease, of, use, when, working, with, software, synthesizers, and, sound, processors, every, tool, imaginable, is, within, immediate, reach, or, just, a, few, mouse, clicks, away, on, the, internet, the, band, is, also, known, for, being, notoriously, reclusive, providing, rare, and, enigmatic, interviews, using, life, size, mannequins, and, robots, while, conducting, official, photo, shoots, refusing, to, answer, fanmail, and, barring, visitors, from, the, kling, klang, studio, the, precise, location, of, which, they, used, to, keep, secret, another, notable, example, of, this, eccentric, behavior, was, reported, to, johnny, marr, of, the, smiths, by, karl, bartos, who, explained, that, anyone, trying, to, contact, the, band, for, collaboration, would, be, told, the, studio, telephone, did, not, have, a, ringer, since, while, recording, the, band, did, not, like, to, hear, any, kind, of, noise, pollution, instead, callers, were, instructed, to, phone, the, studio, precisely, at, a, certain, time, whereupon, the, phone, would, be, answered, by, ralf, h, tter, despite, never, hearing, the, phone, ring, chris, martin, of, coldplay, recalled, in, a, 2007, article, in, q, magazine, the, process, of, requesting, permission, to, use, the, melody, from, the, track, computer, love, on, talk, from, the, album, x, y, he, sent, a, letter, through, the, lawyers, of, the, respective, parties, and, several, weeks, later, received, an, envelope, containing, a, handwritten, reply, that, simply, said, yes, according, to, music, journalist, neil, mccormick, kraftwerk, might, be, the, most, influential, group, in, pop, history, nme, wrote, the, beatles, and, kraftwerk, may, not, have, the, ring, of, the, beatles, and, the, stones, but, nonetheless, these, are, the, two, most, important, bands, in, music, history, allmusic, wrote, that, their, music, resonates, in, virtually, every, new, development, to, impact, the, contemporary, pop, scene, of, the, late, 20th, century, kraftwerk, s, musical, style, and, image, can, be, heard, and, seen, in, 1980s, synth, pop, groups, such, as, gary, numan, ultravox, john, foxx, the, human, league, visage, soft, cell, and, yellow, magic, orchestra, kraftwerk, influenced, other, forms, of, music, such, as, hip, hop, house, and, drum, and, bass, and, they, are, also, regarded, as, pioneers, of, the, electro, genre, karl, hyde, of, underworld, has, referenced, kraftwerk, as, a, prominent, influence, most, notably, trans, europe, express, and, numbers, were, interpolated, into, planet, rock, by, afrika, bambaataa, the, soul, sonic, force, one, of, the, earliest, hip, hop, electro, hits, kraftwerk, helped, ignite, the, new, york, electro, movement, techno, was, created, by, three, musicians, from, detroit, often, referred, to, as, the, belleville, three, juan, atkins, kevin, saunderson, derrick, may, who, fused, the, repetitive, melodies, of, kraftwerk, with, funk, rhythms, the, belleville, three, were, heavily, influenced, by, kraftwerk, and, their, sounds, because, kraftwerk, s, sounds, appealed, to, the, middle, class, black, people, residing, in, detroit, at, this, time, depeche, mode, s, composer, martin, gore, said, for, anyone, of, our, generation, involved, in, electronic, music, kraftwerk, were, the, godfathers, daniel, miller, founder, of, mute, records, purchased, the, vocoder, used, by, kraftwerk, in, their, early, albums, comparing, it, to, owning, the, guitar, jimi, hendrix, used, on, purple, haze, andy, mccluskey, and, paul, humphreys, founding, members, of, orchestral, manoeuvres, in, the, dark, omd, have, stated, that, kraftwerk, was, a, major, reference, on, their, early, work, omd, covered, neon, lights, on, the, 1991, album,

of, his, 13, favourite, albums, of, all, time, according, to, nme, kraftwerk, s, pioneering, robot, pop, also, spawned, groups, like, the, prodigy, and, daft, punk, kraftwerk, inspired, many, acts,

siouxsie, and, the, banshees, is, extraordinary, just, like, the, arrangements, of, alexander, b, l, nescu, for, his, balanescu, quartet, release, we, also, like, the, album, el, baile, alem, n, of, se, or, coconut, a, lot, members, of, blondie, have, admitted, on, several, occasions, that, kraftwerk, were, an, important, reference, for, their, sound, by, the, time, they, were, working, on, their, third, album, parallel, lines, the, worldwide, hit, heart, of, glass, turned, radically, from, an, initial, reggae, flavoured, style, to, its, distinctive, electronic, sound, in, order, to,
