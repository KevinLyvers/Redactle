napoleon, gave, bernadotte, a, friendly, visit, at, his, headquarters, at, udine, but, immediately, after, deprived, him, of, half, his, division, of, the, army, of, the, rhine, and, commanded, him,

of, 13, september, he, found, his, resignation, announced, in, le, moniteur, universel, before, he, was, aware, that, he, had, tendered, it, this, was, a, trick, played, upon, him, by, siey, s, and, roger, ducos, the, directors, allied, to, napoleon, though, bernadotte, declined, to, help, napoleon, bonaparte, stage, his, coup, d, tat, of, november, 1799, napoleon, was, resolved, to, win, over, the, obstacle, man, and, showered, him, with, honors, napoleon, acknowledged, bernadotte, s, administrative, ability, and, influence, by, naming, him, a, councillor, of, state, in, february, 1800, in,

the, west, in, the, rebellious, vend, e, where, he, successfully, restored, its, tranquility, this, was, seen, as, an, appointment, of, trust, as, while, napoleon, embarked, on, his, summer, italian, campaign, where, he, ultimately, prevailed, at, the, battle, of, marengo, he, left, bernadotte, not, far, from, paris, with, an, army, in, his, farewell, note, to, bernadotte, on, his, way, to, italy, napoleon, wrote, i, am, going, to, fling, myself, once, more, into, the, hazards, of, war, we, do, not, know, how, it, may, turn, out, if, i, fall, you, will, find, yourself, with, 40, 000, men, at, the, gates, of, paris, in, your, hands, will, be, the, fate, of, the, republic, as, bernadotte, was, brother, in, law, to, joseph, and, close, friends, with, his, other, brothers, and, sisters, napoleon, is, thought, to, have, been, considering, the, welfare, of, his, family, in, the, possible, event, of, his, death, on, the, battlefield, as, well, as, the, future, of, the, country, by, leaving, his, erstwhile, rival, in, a, position, to, seize, the, reins, of, government, as, of, his, former, rivals, only, bernadotte, had, the, political, and, military, skill, and, popularity, to,

louisiana, on, the, introduction, of, the, first, french, empire, bernadotte, became, one, of, the, eighteen, marshals, of, the, empire, and, from, june, 1804, to, september, 1805, served, as, governor, of, the, recently, occupied, hanover, in, this, capacity, as, well, as, during, his, later, command, of, the, army, of, northern, germany, he, created, for, himself, a, reputation, for, independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and, administrative, ability, bernadotte, s, rule, was, popular, and, despite, the, exactions, taken, from, the, populace, as, part, of, napoleon, s, policy, of, making, occupations, pay, for, themselves, hanover, s, economy, prospered, bernadotte, extended, his, protection, and, made, private, contributions, to, gottingen, university, befriending, many, of, the, professors, and, other, men, of, learning, whom, he, often, had, over, for, dinner, and, employed, to, tutor, himself, and, his, wife, during, the, campaign, of, 1805, bernadotte, with, his, army, corps, from, hanover, formed, into, the, i, corps, commanded, the, left, wing, of, the, grande, arm, e, overseeing, auguste, de, marmont, s, ii, corps, and, having, the, majority, of, the, bavarian, army, attached, to, his, command, some, 65, 000, men, or, 1, 4th, of, the, army, bernadotte, was, also, tasked, with, assuring, france, s, newest, ally, the, elector, of, bavaria, maximillian, iv, joseph, that, the, austrians, would, be, driven, from, his, country, bernadotte, with, davout, s, iii, corps, attached, to, his, command, and, the, bavarians, gained, a, victory, over, the, austrians, driving, them, out, of, munich, on, 12, october, taking, some, 3000, prisoners, and, 19, guns, and, installing, maximillian, joseph, back, onto, his, throne, i, corps, then, co, operated, in, the, great, movement, which, resulted, in, the, shutting, off, of, mack, in, the, battle, of, ulm, bernadotte, s, troops, then, captured, salzburg, on, 30, october, in, the, battle, of, austerlitz, 2, december, 1805, he, was, posted, with, his, corps, in, the, center, between, soult, and, lannes, and, contributed, to, defeating, the, attempt, of, the, right, wing, of, the, allies, to, outflank, the, french, army, as, a, reward, for, his, services, at, austerlitz, he, became, the, 1st, sovereign, prince, of, pontecorvo, 5, june, 1806, a, district, in, southern, italy, formerly, subject, to, the, pope, during, the, 1806, campaign, against, prussia, bernadotte, was, reproached, by, napoleon, for, not, participating, with, his, army, corps, in, the, battles, of, jena, and, auerst, dt, 14, october, 1806, napoleon, on, the, night, of, 13, october, thinking, he, had, faced, the, whole, prussian, army, at, jena, sent, orders, to, davout, through, marshal, berthier, davout, relayed, the, order, to, bernadotte, at, 0400, on, 14, october, with, the, order, stating, if, the, prince, of, ponte, corvo, is, with, you, you, may, both, march, together, but, the, emperor, hopes, that, he, will, be, in, the, position, which, had, been, indicated, at, dornburg, this, was, in, accordance, with, bernadotte, s, last, set, of, written, orders, from, 12, october, which, ordered, him, and, davout, to, get, across, the, prussian, line, of, retreat, in, pursuance, of, these, orders, bernadotte, separately, from, davout, left, naumburg, at, dawn, on, the, morning, of, the, 14th, for, dornburg, and, marched, toward, apolda, which, he, reached, by, 16, 00, hampered, by, the, very, poor, state, of, the, roads, and, a, steep, defile, within, which, dornburg, is, situated, and, the, narrow, bridge, which, passes, over, the, saale, that, could, pass, but, one, artillery, piece, at, a, time, according, to, general, dupont, he, could, not, engage, in, the, battle, of, jena, though, he, effectively, compelled, the, prussians, to, retreat, from, both, battlefields, by, posting, his, troops, on, the, heights, of, apolda, the, defile, was, such, an, obstacle, that, bernadotte, s, 3rd, infantry, division, commanded, by, jean, baptiste, drouet, comte, d, erlon, was, still, in, the, midst, of, crossing, the, bridge, well, after, nightfall, making, it, unlikely, that, bernadotte, could, have, intervened, at, auerst, dt, in, any, event, he, later, was, accused, of, deliberately, refusing, to, support, davout, who, had, unexpectedly, encountered, the, prussian, main, army, at, auerst, dt, out, of, jealousy, and, napoleon, if, reminiscences, from, st, helena, may, be, believed, once, intended, to, put, bernadotte, before, a, court, martial, in, fact, he, did, what, he, had, been, ordered, to, do, and, more, fundamental, responsibility, for, his, absence, rests, upon, the, ambiguous, and, indirect, orders, issued, by, berthier, and, napoleon, s, unawareness, of, the, prussian, position, documentary, evidence, supports, bernadotte, s, assertion, that, he, was, ordered, to, dornberg, as, no, orders, from, napoleon, to, bernadotte, to, march, with, davout, were, ever, found, in, french, imperial, archives, while, berthier, s, order, of, 14, october, were, confirmed, after, the, battle, of, jena, bernadotte, crushed, the, prussian, reserve, army, all, fresh, troops, fortified, behind, a, marsh, and, the, river, saale, under, duke, eugen, of, w, rttemberg, at, halle, 17, october, 1806, though, imperial, headquarters, did, not, much, appreciate, this, victory, when, visiting, halle, after, the, battle, and, commenting, on, the, degree, of, difficulty, of, storming, a, fortified, position, accessible, only, by, a, single, bridge, napoleon, enigmatically, commented, bernadotte, stops, at, nothing, someday, the, gascon, will, get, caught, subsequently, bernadotte, pursued, conjointly, with, soult, and, murat, known, as, the, pursuit, of, the, three, marshals, prussian, general, bl, cher, s, corps, to, l, beck, where, his, troops, stormed, the, prussian, defenses, taking, the, city, and, forcing, bl, cher, s, capitulation, at, ratekau, 7, november, 1806, when, the, french, forced, their, way, into, l, beck, the, city, became, the, target, of, large, scale, looting, and, rampage, by, the, french, soldiers, bernadotte, struggling, desperately, to, prevent, his, men, from, sacking, the, city, was, given, six, horses, from, the, council, of, l, beck, as, a, token, of, their, appreciation, he, also, treated, with, courtesy, 1600, swedish, prisoners, under, the, command, of, colonel, count, gustaf, m, rner, and, allowed, them, to, return, to, their, home, country, the, impressed, swedes, went, home, with, a, tale, of, bernadotte, s, fairness, in, maintaining, order, within, the, city, count, m, rner, would, later, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, election, of, bernadotte, as, crown, prince, of, sweden, thereafter, he, marched, to, poland, in, command, of, the, french, left, wing, composed, of, his, i, corps, and, ney, s, vi, corps, left, unsupported, by, ney, s, unexpected, movement, toward, k, nigsberg, the, russians, under, levin, august, von, bennigsen, passed, over, to, the, offensive, and, attempted, to, destroy, bernadotte, s, and, ney, s, isolated, corps, napoleon, having, received, word, of, the, russian, offensive, gave, word, to, bernadotte, to, retreat, west, as, to, draw, the, russians, toward, him, so, that, napoleon, could, then, cut, off, and, surround, the, russians, bernadotte, moved, west, as, ordered, pursued, by, bennigsen, where, he, defeated, the, numerically, superior, russian, vanguard, at, mohrungen, 25, january, 1807, during, the, battle, bernadotte, s, personal, wagon, was, captured, by, the, russians, and, he, was, accused, by, the, cossacks, who, looted, his, baggage, of, having, extorted, a, large, quantity, of, silver, plate, from, minor, german, states, this, claim, is, unsubstantiated, and, contrary, to, his, reputation, he, was, known, throughout, the, army, for, his, probity, and, honesty, in, the, conduct, of, his, affairs, on, campaign, and, he, refrained, from, the, looting, and, brigandage, that, many, of, his, fellow, marshals, engaged, in, as, a, consequence, his, table, fare, was, considered, poor, by, his, brother, marshals, and, while, others, dined, on, fine, service, and, employed, chefs, he, habitually, used, his, own, money, to, pay, for, food, for, his, troops, and, to, give, money, awards, to, those, who, merited, recognition, he, held, his, troops, to, the, same, high, standard, he, punished, looting, and, rape, severely, and, was, known, to, intervene, with, his, sword, drawn, against, those, engaged, in, pillaging, as, was, the, case, following, the, capture, of, l, beck, due, to, the, capture, of, a, courier, carrying, the, emperor, s, latest, orders, bernadotte, was, not, informed, of, a, change, of, strategy, to, move, east, toward, the, rest, of, the, french, army, as, a, consequence, bernadotte, s, i, corps, was, too, far, away, to, take, part, in, the, battle, of, eylau, 7, to, 8, february, 1807, napoleon, rebuked, him, for, his, absence, but, it, became, acknowledged, that, it, was, not, due, to, bernadotte, but, berthier, s, carelessness, in, dispatching, the, orderly, the, russians, resumed, the, offensive, that, summer, and, bernadotte, was, attacked, by, and, defeated, a, strong, prussian, corps, at, spanden, preserving, the, french, bridgehead, over, the, pas, ka, where, he, was, nearly, killed, when, a, spent, ball, struck, him, in, the, neck, due, to, this, near, fatal, wound, bernadotte, was, invalided, to, the, rear, and, missed, the, remainder, of, the, polish, campaign, after, the, peace, of, tilsit, on, 14, july, 1807, he, became, governor, of, the, hanseatic, towns, where, he, once, again, proved, his, administrative, and, diplomatic, abilities, and, was, well, liked, he, was, to, direct, the, expedition, against, sweden, via, the, danish, islands, but, the, plan, came, to, naught, because, of, the, want, of, transports, and, the, defection, of, the, spanish, contingent, which, went, back, to, spain, to, fight, against, napoleon, at, the, start, of, the, peninsular, war, pursuant, to, the, projected, invasion, of, sweden, and, by, virtue, of, denmark, becoming, an, ally, of, france, in, 1808, bernadotte, found, himself, de, facto, head, of, a, french, occupation, of, denmark, he, maintained, strict, discipline, of, his, troops, and, his, good, treatment, of, the, danes, made, him, popular, with, the, populace, and, danish, royal, family, upon, his, departure, from, denmark, he, was, one, of, few, frenchmen, of, the, period, to, be, awarded, the, order, of, the, elephant, during, bernadotte, s, time, as, governor, of, the, hanseatic, cities, the, abdications, of, bayonne, occurred, an, event, that, triggered, the, peninsular, war, that, would, play, so, large, a, role, in, napoleon, s, defeat, for, a, time, napoleon, considered, the, notion, of, placing, bernadotte, on, the, spanish, throne, going, so, far, as, to, hint, at, it, in, a, letter, to, him, bernadotte, made, it, known, to, napoleon, that, he, did, not, want, the, spanish, crown, joseph, bonaparte, bernadotte, s, friend, and, brother, in, law, was, chosen, instead, it, was, not, the, first, or, last, time, that, napoleon, thought, of, placing, bernadotte, on, a, foreign, throne, indeed, napoleon, on, several, occasions, both, during, his, days, as, first, consul, and, then, as, emperor, thought, of, naming, bernadotte, napoleon, also, considered, murat, as, his, successor, by, adoption, despite, their, rivalry, napoleon, thought, bernadotte, alone, had, the, popularity, administrative, and, military, skill, to, safeguard, the, empire, he, had, built, the, birth, of, the, king, of, rome, put, an, end, to, napoleon, s, need, for, an, heir, ironically, bernadotte, eventually, wore, a, crown, not, through, the, auspices, of, napoleon, but, as, an, enemy, of, france, recalled, to, germany, to, assist, in, the, new, war, between, france, and, austria, he, received, the, command, of, the, 9th, corps, which, was, mainly, composed, of, saxons, further, difficulties, with, berthier, and, a, saddling, with, ill, prepared, saxons, combined, with, an, illness, compelled, bernadotte, to, beg, for, release, from, service, bernadotte, wrote, to, napoleon, that, i, see, my, efforts, perpetually, paralyzed, by, a, hidden, force, over, which, i, can, not, prevail, napoleon, disregarded, these, appeals, and, bernadotte, proceeded, with, the, campaign, commanding, mostly, foreign, troops, with, few, french, troops, under, his, command, at, the, battle, of, wagram, 5, july, 1809, he, entered, battle, with, his, saxon, corps, to, which, the, division, of, dupas, was, attached, and, which, formed, his, reserve, resting, on, the, french, left, bernadotte, s, corps, was, battered, during, the, night, but, resisted, the, full, fury, of, the, austrian, attack, facing, superior, numbers, at, a, critical, moment, he, ordered, dupas, forward, to, his, support, the, latter, replied, that, he, had, orders, from, the, emperor, to, remain, where, he, was, having, been, badly, mauled, and, fully, exposed, ahead, of, the, main, french, line, ix, corps, withdrew, from, the, village, of, aderklaa, against, napoleon, s, orders, on, the, second, day, of, battle, 6, july, 1809, ix, corps, having, been, mauled, the, night, before, wherein, bernadotte, struggled, to, rally, his, demoralized, saxons, was, attacked, by, two, austrian, corps, as, part, of, archduke, charles, s, effort, to, break, the, french, line, this, time, bernadotte, s, depleted, forces, he, had, only, 6, 000, infantry, left, broke, and, fled, bernadotte, s, corps, was, not, the, only, one, to, break, that, day, mass, na, s, troops, were, also, routed, by, the, attack, the, routed, saxons, retreated, in, disorder, toward, raasdorf, as, bernadotte, attempted, to, rally, his, men, where, he, encountered, napoleon, ix, corps, rallied, and, played, a, further, role, in, the, battle, rumors, that, napoleon, relieved, bernadotte, of, command, on, the, spot, at, raasdorf, have, long, been, the, stuff, of, legend, but, are, not, verified, after, the, battle, bernadotte, complained, to, napoleon, for, having, in, violation, of, all, military, rules, ordered, dupas, to, act, independently, of, his, command, and, for, having, thereby, caused, great, loss, of, life, to, the, saxons, and, tendered, his, resignation, napoleon, accepted, after, he, had, become, aware, of, an, order, of, the, day, issued, by, bernadotte, in, which, he, gave, the, saxons, credit, for, their, courage, in, terms, inconsistent, with, the, emperor, s, official, bulletin, accounts, of, bernadotte, s, role, at, wagram, are, contradictory, while, it, is, true, that, ix, corps, broke, on, 6, july, as, did, other, french, formations, they, later, rallied, and, played, a, part, in, the, victory, moreover, bernadotte, fought, with, exceptional, personal, courage, at, the, head, of, his, troops, and, narrowly, avoided, death, when, attacked, by, austrian, cavalry, it, is, likely, that, ix, corps, poor, performance, would, have, been, forgotten, and, bernadotte, would, have, retained, his, command, had, he, never, published, the, controversial, order, of, the, day, his, praise, for, the, saxons, as, well, as, his, mild, and, courteous, treatment, of, them, while, under, his, command, was, never, forgotten, by, the, saxon, officers, and, this, would, later, have, disastrous, consequences, for, the, french, when, a, whole, saxon, division, defected, to, bernadotte, s, army, of, the, north, during, a, key, moment, of, the, battle, of, leipzig, with, bernadotte, having, returned, to, paris, the, walcheren, campaign, july, 1809, caused, the, french, ministry, in, the, absence, of, the, emperor, to, entrust, him, with, the, defense, of, antwerp, with, both, regular, french, and, dutch, troops, along, with, the, national, guard, bernadotte, took, command, of, a, chaotic, situation, wherein, troops, from, all, over, the, empire, and, its, vassal, states, and, raw, conscripts, were, sent, to, holland, under, divided, command, he, re, organized, and, trained, his, forces, named, by, the, emperor, as, the, army, of, antwerp, by, instilling, discipline, in, old, soldiers, too, long, at, the, depots, and, teaching, raw, conscripts, their, trade, everywhere, he, instilled, a, fighting, spirit, making, an, army, out, of, a, mob, and, thus, he, rapidly, brought, the, defenses, of, antwerp, to, a, high, order, of, readiness, with, antwerp, bristling, with, cannon, and, numerous, defenders, and, with, the, army, of, antwerp, whipped, into, fighting, shape, the, british, vexed, by, poor, leadership, and, with, half, the, army, immobilized, with, fever, thanks, to, the, insalubrious, islands, upon, which, they, were, quartered, realized, that, it, was, no, longer, possible, to, close, the, scheldt, or, take, antwerp, and, they, withdrew, their, forces, in, a, proclamation, issued, to, his, troops, at, antwerp, he, made, an, implied, charge, against, napoleon, of, having, neglected, to, prepare, the, proper, means, of, defense, for, the, belgian, coast, a, displeased, napoleon, relieved, bernadotte, of, command, of, his, ad, hoc, army, and, ordered, his, return, to, paris, to, leave, for, catalonia, and, take, command, of, the, army, there, refusing, to, comply, with, the, order, he, was, summoned, to, vienna, and, after, an, interview, with, napoleon, at, sch, nbrunn, accepted, the, general, government, of, the, roman, departments, in, 1810, bernadotte, was, about, to, enter, his, new, post, as, governor, of, rome, when, he, was, unexpectedly, elected, the, heir, presumptive, to, king, charles, xiii, of, sweden, the, problem, of, charles, s, successor, had, been, acute, almost, from, the, time, he, had, ascended, the, throne, a, year, earlier, he, was, 61, years, old, and, in, poor, health, he, was, also, childless, queen, charlotte, had, given, birth, to, two, children, who, had, died, in, infancy, and, there, was, no, prospect, of, her, bearing, another, child, soon, after, his, coronation, the, king, had, adopted, a, danish, prince, charles, august, who, had, died, just, a, few, months, after, his, arrival, despite, the, fact, that, napoleon, favored, his, ally, danish, king, frederick, vi, danish, prince, frederick, christian, initially, had, the, most, support, to, become, the, swedish, crown, prince, the, political, situation, internally, and, externally, for, sweden, meant, that, selecting, a, foreign, king, was, an, attractive, option, sweden, wanted, to, strengthen, its, relationship, with, napoleon, for, militaristic, reasons, and, so, sought, to, select, a, king, who, would, be, able, to, attract, napoleon, s, support, the, swedish, court, initially, sounded, out, the, emperor, for, his, preferences, on, candidates, for, crown, prince, whereupon, napoleon, made, it, clear, he, preferred, his, adopted, stepson, eug, ne, de, beauharnais, or, one, of, his, nephews, or, brothers, the, swedish, envoys, did, not, accept, eug, ne, as, a, candidate, baron, lagerbielke, the, swedish, envoy, in, paris, reported, to, stockholm, that, eug, ne, was, gentle, and, good, but, he, does, not, seem, to, be, a, man, of, strong, character, and, although, he, had, had, great, opportunities, he, does, not, appear, to, have, developed, any, distinguishing, talents, also, eug, ne, serving, as, viceroy, in, italy, did, not, wish, to, convert, to, lutheranism, a, prerequisite, for, accepting, the, swedish, offer, moreover, none, of, napoleon, s, brothers, were, interested, in, going, to, sweden, and, his, nephews, were, too, young, as, the, swedes, did, not, want, the, hazards, of, minority, rule, in, the, event, king, charles, died, prematurely, the, matter, was, decided, by, an, obscure, swedish, courtier, baron, karl, otto, m, rner, nephew, of, count, gustav, m, rner, the, commander, of, the, swedish, force, captured, by, bernadotte, at, l, beck, who, entirely, on, his, own, initiative, offered, the, succession, to, the, swedish, crown, to, bernadotte, bernadotte, communicated, m, rner, s, offer, to, napoleon, who, at, first, treated, the, situation, as, an, absurdity, but, later, came, around, to, the, idea, and, while, adopting, a, public, attitude, of, indifference, quietly, lent, support, to, bernadotte, s, candidacy, both, financially, and, diplomatically, although, the, swedish, government, amazed, at, m, rner, s, effrontery, at, once, placed, him, under, arrest, on, his, return, to, sweden, the, candidature, of, bernadotte, gradually, gained, favour, and, on, 21, august, 1810, he, was, elected, by, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, in, rebro, to, be, the, new, crown, prince, and, was, subsequently, made, generalissimus, of, the, swedish, armed, forces, by, the, king, several, factors, benefitted, bernadotte, s, election, being, foreign, was, although, problematic, also, to, his, favour, due, to, geopolitical, factors, and, the, internal, situation, at, the, time, one, benefit, was, his, presumed, close, ties, to, french, emperor, napoleon, bonaparte, with, whom, a, relationship, would, provide, military, backing, as, the, intention, at, the, time, was, to, reacquire, finland, the, current, king, charles, xiii, viewed, napoleon, in, a, more, positive, way, than, gustav, iv, adolf, had, who, had, held, him, in, very, ill, regard, another, point, in, favour, was, that, a, large, part, of, the, swedish, army, anticipating, conflict, with, russia, were, in, favour, of, electing, a, soldier, also, bernadotte, was, personally, popular, owing, to, the, kindness, he, had, shown, to, the, swedish, prisoners, in, l, beck, and, his, reputation, as, the, well, liked, governor, of, the, hanseatic, cities, from, 1807, to, 1809, as, many, swedish, merchants, had, operated, under, his, auspices, finally, bernadotte, had, no, qualms, about, converting, to, lutheranism, recalling, the, conversion, of, henry, iv, for, the, benefit, of, france, with, whom, he, felt, a, kinship, as, both, hailed, from, pau, nor, converting, his, son, oscar, though, his, wife, d, sir, e, never, did, renounce, catholicism, before, freeing, bernadotte, from, his, allegiance, to, france, napoleon, asked, him, to, agree, never, to, take, up, arms, against, france, bernadotte, refused, to, make, any, such, agreement, upon, the, ground, that, his, obligations, to, sweden, would, not, allow, it, napoleon, exclaimed, go, and, let, our, destinies, be, accomplished, and, signed, the, act, of, emancipation, unconditionally, many, were, also, optimistic, that, sweden, would, recover, finland, under, charles, john, the, swedish, crown, prince, even, unsuccessfully, sought, napoleon, s, support, to, assist, sweden, in, conquering, norway, on, 2, november, 1810, bernadotte, made, his, solemn, entry, into, stockholm, and, on, 5, november, he, received, the, homage, of, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, and, he, was, adopted, by, king, charles, xiii, under, the, name, of, charles, john, karl, johan, at, the, same, time, he, converted, from, roman, catholicism, to, the, lutheranism, of, the, swedish, court, i, have, beheld, war, near, at, hand, and, i, know, all, its, evils, for, it, is, not, conquest, which, can, console, a, country, for, the, blood, of, her, children, spilt, on, a, foreign, land, i, have, seen, the, mighty, emperor, of, the, french, so, often, crowned, with, the, laurel, of, victory, surrounded, by, his, invincible, armies, sigh, after, the, olive, branches, of, peace, yes, gentlemen, peace, is, the, only, glorious, aim, of, a, sage, and, enlightened, government, it, is, not, the, extent, of, a, state, which, constitutes, its, strength, and, independence, it, is, its, laws, its, commerce, its, industry, and, above, all, its, national, spirit, charles, john, address, to, the, estates, 5, november, 1810, the, new, crown, prince, was, very, soon, the, most, popular, and, most, powerful, man, in, sweden, and, quickly, impressed, his, adoptive, father, following, his, first, meeting, with, his, new, heir, charles, xiii, who, had, initially, opposed, bernadotte, s, candidacy, remarked, to, his, aide, de, camp, count, charles, de, suremain, my, dear, suremain, i, have, gambled, heavily, and, i, believe, that, after, all, i, have, won, he, also, made, himself, well, liked, by, queen, charlotte, who, regarded, him, a, gentleman, in, every, sense, of, the, word, and, established, a, net, of, contact, within, the, swedish, aristocracy, befriending, in, particular, the, brahe, family, through, his, favorite, magnus, brahe, and, countess, aurora, wilhelmina, brahe, whose, cousin, mariana, koskull, became, his, lover, the, infirmity, of, the, old, king, and, the, dissensions, in, the, privy, council, of, sweden, placed, the, government, and, especially, the, control, of, foreign, policy, entirely, in, his, hands, amongst, the, first, of, charles, john, s, acts, as, crown, prince, was, to, address, the, dire, state, of, the, swedish, economy, the, swedish, economy, was, in, shambles, after, years, of, mismanagement, since, the, reign, of, gustav, iii, and, aggravated, during, the, reign, of, his, son, gustav, iv, adolf, the, economic, turmoil, had, been, caused, in, part, by, the, debts, accrued, from, gustav, iii, s, russian, war, in, part, to, the, failure, of, several, of, gustav, iv, adolf, s, well, intentioned, economic, reforms, gustav, iv, adolf, was, rather, more, successful, in, his, agrarian, reforms, and, the, costs, of, the, more, recent, wars, against, france, and, russia, under, gustav, iv, adolf, genuine, attempts, at, economic, reform, including, paying, down, the, national, debt, by, some, 700, 000, riksdalers, in, the, first, years, of, his, active, reign, and, revitalizing, the, currency, met, with, limited, success, such, measures, were, undermined, by, his, other, policies, gustav, iv, adolf, s, personal, dislike, of, the, riksdag, which, had, the, power, to, raise, taxes, led, to, his, refusal, to, call, them, into, session, after, 1800, crippling, his, attempts, to, raise, state, revenues, gustav, iv, adolf, s, foreign, policy, plunged, sweden, into, disastrous, and, expensive, wars, against, france, and, russia, the, cost, of, years, of, war, several, poor, harvests, in, the, years, between, 1798, and, 1809, the, ineptitude, of, his, ministers, in, carrying, out, fiscal, reforms, and, the, loss, of, the, tax, base, of, finland, had, ballooned, sweden, s, national, debt, the, impending, demands, of, napoleon, to, adhere, to, the, continental, system, forecasted, even, greater, difficulties, charles, john, immediately, began, making, reforms, and, used, his, sizable, fortune, accrued, honestly, during, his, time, as, french, marshal, to, pay, off, much, of, the, debt, and, to, stabilize, the, economy, by, both, grants, and, via, a, loan, to, the, state, of, 300, 000, sterling, at, five, percent, interest, charles, john, also, purchased, back, from, the, french, private, estates, that, had, been, confiscated, during, the, occupation, of, swedish, pomerania, from, 1808, to, 1810, and, returned, them, to, their, original, swedish, and, german, owners, the, keynote, of, his, foreign, and, domestic, policy, was, maintenance, of, swedish, independence, of, action, often, in, the, face, of, french, demands, and, the, acquisition, of, norway, as, a, compensation, for, the, loss, of, finland, many, swedes, expected, him, to, reconquer, finland, which, had, been, ceded, to, russia, the, crown, prince, was, aware, of, its, difficulty, for, reasons, of, the, desperate, situation, of, the, state, finance, and, the, reluctance, of, the, finnish, people, to, return, to, sweden, even, if, finland, was, regained, he, thought, it, would, put, sweden, into, a, new, cycle, of, conflicts, with, a, powerful, neighbor, because, there, was, no, guarantee, russia, would, accept, the, loss, as, final, therefore, he, made, up, his, mind, to, make, a, united, scandinavian, peninsula, which, was, easier, to, defend, by, taking, norway, intentionally, without, the, ancient, and, remote, provinces, of, greenland, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, from, denmark, and, uniting, her, to, sweden, he, tried, to, divert, public, opinion, from, finland, to, norway, by, arguing, that, to, create, a, compact, peninsula, with, sea, for, its, natural, boundary, was, to, inaugurate, an, era, of, peace, and, that, waging, war, with, russia, would, lead, to, ruinous, consequences, soon, after, charles, john, s, arrival, in, sweden, napoleon, compelled, him, to, accede, to, the, continental, system, and, declare, war, against, great, britain, otherwise, sweden, would, have, to, face, the, determination, of, france, denmark, and, russia, this, demand, would, mean, a, hard, blow, to, the, national, economy, and, the, swedish, population, sweden, reluctantly, declared, war, against, the, uk, which, was, treated, by, both, countries, as, merely, nominal, although, swedish, imports, of, british, goods, decreased, from, 4, 871, million, in, 1810, to, 523, million, in, the, following, year, in, january, 1812, french, troops, suddenly, invaded, swedish, pomerania, and, the, island, of, r, gen, officially, the, french, claimed, that, sweden, had, repeatedly, violated, the, continental, system, and, that, the, occupation, of, stralsund, and, swedish, pomerania, was, closing, an, entrep, t, for, illegal, british, goods, napoleon, before, marching, to, moscow, also, had, to, secure, his, rear, and, dared, not, allow, a, swedish, continental, foothold, behind, him, as, he, did, not, trust, charles, john, charles, john, believed, that, napoleon, scheduled, the, occupation, to, occur, on, the, crown, prince, s, birthday, and, ordered, charles, john, s, old, rival, marshal, davout, to, execute, the, operation, as, a, personal, insult, adding, another, dimension, of, personal, enmity, to, the, incident, as, a, result, the, initially, amicable, relationship, which, charles, john, had, with, napoleon, following, his, election, as, crown, prince, soon, changed, because, of, the, invasion, the, invasion, was, a, clear, violation, of, international, law, as, well, as, an, act, of, war, and, public, opinion, in, sweden, was, outraged, moreover, it, antagonized, the, pro, french, faction, at, the, swedish, court, thereafter, the, crown, prince, declared, the, neutrality, of, sweden, and, opened, negotiations, with, the, uk, and, russia, in, 1812, he, allied, sweden, with, its, traditional, enemy, russia, and, sought, to, make, peace, with, the, united, kingdom, with, whom, sweden, was, technically, at, war, charles, john, s, personal, diplomacy, served, as, the, bridge, between, russia, and, the, uk, as, on, 18, july, 1812, the, treaty, of, rebro, formally, ended, the, wars, between, britain, and, sweden, and, britain, and, russia, and, formed, an, alliance, between, russia, britain, and, sweden, creating, the, sixth, coalition, the, treaty, stipulated, that, sweden, would, land, an, army, of, no, less, than, 25, 000, on, the, continent, for, the, express, purpose, of, fighting, france, as, well, as, liberating, swedish, pomerania, and, in, exchange, russia, and, the, uk, would, diplomatically, and, militarily, support, the, cession, of, norway, from, the, doggedly, french, allied, denmark, to, sweden, throughout, summer, and, fall, 1812, bernadotte, sought, to, add, more, allies, to, the, coalition, and, negotiated, a, treaty, with, the, spanish, supreme, central, junta, against, his, own, brother, in, law, who, was, currently, the, french, backed, king, of, spain, although, napoleon, had, forced, frederick, william, iii, to, break, off, relations, with, sweden, charles, john, corresponded, with, the, king, of, prussia, encouraging, him, to, renounce, the, forced, alliance, with, france, and, join, the, coalition, following, the, convention, of, tauroggen, which, broke, the, prussian, french, alliance, frederick, wilhelm, signed, the, treaty, of, kalisz, with, russia, and, then, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, sweden, on, the, basis, of, prussian, recognition, of, the, norwegian, cession, to, sweden, in, exchange, for, swedish, pomerania, thus, formally, joining, the, coalition, in, spring, 1813, after, the, defeats, at, l, tzen, 2, may, 1813, and, bautzen, 21, may, 1813, it, was, the, swedish, crown, prince, who, put, fresh, fighting, spirit, into, the, allies, and, at, the, conference, of, trachenberg, he, drew, up, the, trachenberg, plan, the, general, plan, for, the, campaign, which, began, after, the, expiration, of, the, truce, of, pl, switz, charles, john, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, northern, army, successfully, defended, the, approaches, to, berlin, and, was, victorious, in, battle, against, oudinot, in, august, and, against, ney, in, september, at, the, battles, of, gro, beeren, and, dennewitz, bernadotte, s, army, of, the, north, would, continue, to, guard, berlin, and, keep, watch, on, davout, s, forces, in, hamburg, while, the, allies, in, accordance, with, the, plan, conceived, at, trachenberg, maneuvered, toward, napoleon, s, army, at, leipzig, with, the, other, allied, armies, engaged, in, battle, on, 17, october, bernadotte, s, army, finally, crossed, the, elbe, and, joined, in, the, battle, of, leipzig, on, 19, october, his, fresh, troops, reinforced, by, 30, 000, prussians, joined, the, fray, against, the, already, battered, french, lines, where, swedish, forces, entered, battle, in, numbers, for, the, first, time, in, the, campaign, at, a, critical, moment, entire, saxon, regiments, went, over, to, his, army, in, response, to, a, proclamation, released, a, week, prior, in, which, bernadotte, invited, the, saxons, to, join, their, old, commander, in, defeating, napoleon, the, army, of, the, north, committed, the, coup, de, gr, ce, on, the, already, depleted, french, and, bernadotte, was, the, first, of, the, allied, sovereigns, to, enter, leipzig, after, the, battle, of, leipzig, he, went, his, own, way, determined, at, all, hazards, to, cripple, denmark, and, to, secure, norway, defeating, the, danes, in, a, relatively, quick, campaign, his, efforts, culminated, in, the, favourable, treaty, of, kiel, which, transferred, norway, to, swedish, control, the, norwegians, rejected, swedish, control, they, declared, independence, adopted, a, liberal, constitution, and, elected, danish, crown, prince, christian, frederick, to, the, throne, the, ensuing, war, was, swiftly, won, by, sweden, under, charles, john, s, generalship, the, military, operations, in, 1814, were, to, be, sweden, s, last, war, to, this, day, charles, john, could, have, named, his, terms, to, norway, but, in, a, key, concession, accepted, the, constitution, of, norway, and, its, own, political, autonomy, this, paved, the, way, for, norway, to, enter, a, personal, union, with, sweden, later, that, year, during, the, period, of, the, allied, invasion, of, france, in, the, winter, and, spring, of, 1814, when, it, was, unclear, who, would, rule, france, after, the, war, the, russian, tsar, alexander, i, with, support, from, french, liberals, like, benjamin, constant, and, madame, de, sta, l, advocated, placing, charles, john, on, the, french, throne, in, place, of, napoleon, he, would, rule, france, as, a, constitutional, monarch, and, leave, oscar, as, regent, in, sweden, and, norway, ultimately, the, british, and, austrians,

been, regent, and, de, facto, head, of, state, upon, his, arrival, and, took, an, increasing, role, in, government, from, 1812, onward, with, charles, xiii, reduced, to, a, mute, witness, in, government, councils, following, a, stroke, upon, charles, s, death, on, 5, february, 1818, charles, john, ascended, the, throne, he, was, initially, popular, in, both, countries, the, democratic,

1818, the, foreign, policy, applied, by, charles, john, in, the, post, napoleonic, era, was, characterized, by, the, maintenance, of, balance, between, the, great, powers, and, non, involvement, into, conflicts, that, took, place, outside, of, the, scandinavian, peninsula, it, made, a, sharp, contrast, with, sweden, s, previous, hegemonic, expansionism, resulting, in, uninterrupted, wars, with, neighboring, countries, for, centuries, and, he, successfully, kept, his, kingdoms, in, a, state, of, peace, from, 1814, until, his, death, he, was, especially, concerned, about, the, conflict, between, the, uk, and, russia, in, 1834, when, the, relationship, between, the, two, countries, strained, regarding, the, near, east, crisis, he, sent, memoranda, to, british, and, russian, governments, and, proclaimed, neutrality, in, advance, it, is, pointed, out, as, the, origin, of, swedish, neutrality, his, domestic, policy, particularly, focused, on, promotion, of, economy, and, investment, in, social, overhead, capital, and, the, long, peace, since, 1814, led, to, an, increased, prosperity, for, the, country, during, his, long, reign, of, 26, years, 34, years, if, one, counts, his, time, as, regent, from, 1810, to, 1818, the, population, of, the, kingdom, was, so, increased, that, the, inhabitants, of, sweden, alone, became, equal, in, number, to, those, of, sweden, and, finland, before, the, latter, province, was, torn, from, the, former, the, national, debt, was, paid, off, a, civil, and, a, penal, code, were, proposed, for, promulgation, education, was,

very, unpopular, especially, after, 1823, his, dynasty, faced, little, danger, as, the, swedes, and, the, norwegians, alike, were, proud, of, a, monarch, with, a, good, european, reputation, he, also, faced, challenges, in, norway, the, norwegian, constitution, gave, the, norwegian, parliament, the, storting, more, power, than, any, legislature, in, europe, while, charles, john, had, the, power, of, absolute, veto, in, sweden, he, only, had, a, suspensive, veto, in, norway, he, demanded, that, the, storting, give, him, the, power, of, absolute, veto, but, was, forced, to, back, down, charles, john, s, difficult, relationship, with, norway, was, also, demonstrated, by, the, storting, s, unwillingness, to, grant, funds, for, the, construction, of, a, royal, palace, in, the, norwegian, capital, oslo, the, construction, began, in, 1825, but, the, storting, halted, the, funding, after, the, costly, foundation, was, laid, and, demanded, that, the, appointed, architect, hans, linstow, construct, a, simpler, palace, this, was, seen, by, many, as, a, protest, against, unnecessary, spending, and, the, king, s, authority, the, palace, itself, was, not, completed, until, 1849, long, after, the, death, of, charles, john, and, was, inaugurated, by, oscar, i, the, main, street, in, oslo, slottsgate, n, would, later, be, named, after, charles, john, as, karl, johans, gate, his, popularity, decreased, for, a, time, in, the, 1830s, culminating, in, the, rabulist, riots, after, the, l, se, majest, conviction, of, the, journalist, magnus, jacob, crusenstolpe, and, some, calls, for, his, abdication, charles, john, survived, the, abdication, controversy, and, he, went, on, to, have, his, silver, jubilee, which, was, celebrated, with, great, enthusiasm, on, 18, february, 1843,

nobody, has, had, a, career, in, life, like, mine, i, could, perhaps, have, been, able, to, agree, to, become, napoleon, s, ally, but, when, he, attacked, the, country, that, had, placed, its, fate,
