konrad, ernst, otto, zuse, german, 22, june, 1910, 18, december, 1995, was, a, german, civil, engineer, pioneering, computer, scientist, inventor, and, businessman, his, greatest, achievement, was, the, world, s, first, programmable, computer, the, functional, program, controlled, turing, complete, z3, became, operational, in, may, 1941, thanks, to, this, machine, and, its, predecessors, zuse, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, inventor, and, father, of, the, modern, computer, zuse, was, noted, for, the, s2, computing, machine, considered, the, first, process, control, computer, in, 1941, he, founded, one, of, the, earliest, computer, businesses, producing, the, z4, which, became, the, world, s, first, commercial, computer, from, 1943, to, 1945, he, designed, plankalk, l, the, first, high, level, programming, language, in, 1969, zuse, suggested, the, concept, of, a, computation, based, universe, in, his, book, rechnender, raum, calculating, space, much, of, his, early, work, was, financed, by, his, family, and, commerce, but, after, 1939, he, was, given, resources, by, the, government, of, nazi, germany, due, to, world, war, ii, zuse, s, work, went, largely, unnoticed, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, possibly, his, first, documented, influence, on, a, us, company, was, ibm, s, option, on, his, patents, in, 1946, konrad, zuse, was, born, in, berlin, on, 22, june, 1910, in, 1912, his, family, moved, to, east, prussian, braunsberg, now, braniewo, in, poland, where, his, father, was, a, postal, clerk, zuse, attended, the, collegium, hosianum, in, braunsberg, and, in, 1923, the, family, moved, to, hoyerswerda, where, he, passed, his, abitur, in, 1928, qualifying, him, to, enter, university, he, enrolled, at, technische, hochschule, berlin, now, technische, universit, t, berlin, and, explored, both, engineering, and, architecture, but, found, them, boring, zuse, then, pursued, civil, engineering, graduating, in, 1935, after, graduation, zuse, worked, for, the, ford, motor, company, using, his, artistic, skills, in, the, design, of, advertisements, he, started, work, as, a, design, engineer, at, the, henschel, aircraft, factory, in, sch, nefeld, near, berlin, this, required, the, performance, of, many, routine, calculations, by, hand, leading, him, to, theorize, and, plan, a, way, of, doing, them, by, machine, beginning, in, 1935, he, experimented, in, the, construction, of, computers, in, his, parents, flat, on, wrangelstra, e, 38, moving, with, them, into, their, new, flat, on, methfesselstra, e, 10, the, street, leading, up, the, kreuzberg, berlin, 418, working, in, his, parents, apartment, in, 1936, he, produced, his, first, attempt, the, z1, a, floating, point, binary, mechanical, calculator, with, limited, programmability, reading, instructions, from, a, perforated, 35, mm, film, in, 1937, zuse, submitted, two, patents, that, anticipated, a, von, neumann, architecture, in, 1938, he, finished, the, z1, which, contained, some, 30, 000, metal, parts, and, never, worked, well, due, to, insufficient, mechanical, precision, on, 30, january, 1944, the, z1, and, its, original, blueprints, were, destroyed, with, his, parents, flat, and, many, neighbouring, buildings, by, a, british, air, raid, in, world, war, ii, 426, zuse, completed, his, work, entirely, independently, of, other, leading, computer, scientists, and, mathematicians, of, his, day, between, 1936, and, 1945, he, was, in, near, total, intellectual, isolation, in, 1939, zuse, was, called, to, military, service, where, he, was, given, the, resources, to, ultimately, build, the, z2, in, september, 1940, zuse, presented, the, z2, covering, several, rooms, in, the, parental, flat, to, experts, of, the, deutsche, versuchsanstalt, f, r, luftfahrt, dvl, german, research, institute, for, aviation, 424, the, z2, was, a, revised, version, of, the, z1, using, telephone, relays, in, 1940, the, german, government, began, funding, him, and, his, company, through, the, aerodynamische, versuchsanstalt, ava, aerodynamic, research, institute, forerunner, of, the, dlr, which, used, his, work, for, the, production, of, glide, bombs, zuse, built, the, s1, and, s2, computing, machines, which, were, special, purpose, devices, which, computed, aerodynamic, corrections, to, the, wings, of, radio, controlled, flying, bombs, the, s2, featured, an, integrated, analog, to, digital, converter, under, program, control, making, it, the, first, process, controlled, computer, 75, in, 1941, zuse, started, a, company, zuse, apparatebau, zuse, apparatus, construction, to, manufacture, his, machines, renting, a, workshop, on, the, opposite, side, in, methfesselstra, e, 7, and, stretching, through, the, block, to, belle, alliance, stra, e, 29, renamed, and, renumbered, as, mehringdamm, 84, in, 1947, 418, 425, in, 1941, he, improved, on, the, basic, z2, machine, and, built, the, z3, on, 12, may, 1941, zuse, presented, the, z3, built, in, his, workshop, to, the, public, 425, the, z3, was, a, binary, 22, bit, floating, point, calculator, featuring, programmability, with, loops, but, without, conditional, jumps, with, memory, and, a, calculation, unit, based, on, telephone, relays, the, telephone, relays, used, in, his, machines, were, largely, collected, from, discarded, stock, despite, the, absence, of, conditional, jumps, the, z3, was, a, turing, complete, computer, however, turing, completeness, was, never, considered, by, zuse, who, was, unaware, of, turing, s, work, and, had, practical, applications, in, mind, and, only, demonstrated, in, 1998, see, history, of, computing, hardware, the, z3, the, first, fully, operational, electromechanical, computer, was, partially, financed, by, german, government, supported, dvl, which, wanted, their, extensive, calculations, automated, a, request, by, his, co, worker, helmut, schreyer, who, had, helped, zuse, build, the, z3, prototype, in, 1938, for, government, funding, for, an, electronic, successor, to, the, z3, was, denied, as, strategically, unimportant, in, 1937, schreyer, had, advised, zuse, to, use, vacuum, tubes, as, switching, elements, zuse, at, this, time, considered, it, a, crazy, idea, schnapsidee, in, his, own, words, zuse, s, workshop, on, methfesselstra, e, 7, along, with, the, z3, was, destroyed, in, an, allied, air, raid, in, late, 1943, and, the, parental, flat, with, z1, and, z2, on, 30, january, the, following, year, whereas, the, successor, z4, which, zuse, had, begun, constructing, in, 1942, 75, in, new, premises, in, the, industriehof, on, oranienstra, e, 6, remained, intact, 428, on, 3, february, 1945, aerial, bombing, caused, devastating, destruction, in, the, luisenstadt, the, area, around, oranienstra, e, including, neighbouring, houses, this, event, effectively, brought, zuse, s, research, and, development, to, a, complete, halt, the, partially, finished, telephone, relay, based, z4, computer, was, then, packed, and, moved, from, berlin, on, 14, february, arriving, in, g, ttingen, approximately, two, weeks, later, 428, these, machines, contributed, to, the, henschel, werke, hs, 293, and, hs, 294, guided, missiles, developed, by, the, german, military, between, 1941, and, 1945, which, were, the, precursors, to, the, modern, cruise, missile, 75, the, circuit, design, of, the, s1, was, the, predecessor, of, zuse, s, z11, 75, zuse, believed, that, these, machines, had, been, captured, by, occupying, soviet, troops, in, 1945, 75, while, working, on, his, z4, computer, zuse, realised, that, programming, in, machine, code, was, too, complicated, he, started, working, on, a, phd, thesis, containing, groundbreaking, research, years, ahead, of, its, time, mainly, the, first, high, level, programming, language, plankalk, l, plan, calculus, and, as, an, elaborate, example, program, the, first, real, computer, chess, engine, after, the, 1945, luisenstadt, bombing, he, fled, from, berlin, to, the, rural, allg, u, in, the, extreme, deprivation, of, post, war, germany, zuse, was, unable, to, build, computers, zuse, founded, one, of, the, earliest, computer, companies, the, zuse, ingenieurb, ro, hopferau, capital, was, raised, in, 1946, through, eth, zurich, and, an, ibm, option, on, zuse, s, patents, in, 1947, according, to, the, memoirs, of, the, german, computer, pioneer, heinz, billing, from, the, max, planck, institute, for, physics, there, was, a, meeting, between, alan, turing, and, konrad, zuse, in, g, ttingen, the, encounter, had, the, form, of, a, colloquium, participants, were, womersley, turing, porter, from, england, and, a, few, german, researchers, like, zuse, walther, and, billing, for, more, details, see, herbert, bruderer, konrad, zuse, und, die, schweiz, it, was, not, until, 1949, that, zuse, was, able, to, resume, work, on, the, z4, he, would, show, the, computer, to, the, mathematician, eduard, stiefel, of, the, eth, zurich, the, two, men, settled, a, deal, to, lend, the, z4, to, the, eth, in, november, 1949, zuse, founded, another, company, zuse, kg, in, haunetal, neukirchen, in, 1957, the, company, s, head, office, moved, to, bad, hersfeld, the, z4, was, finished, and, delivered, to, the, eth, zurich, in, july, 1950, where, it, proved, very, reliable, at, that, time, it, was, the, only, working, digital, computer, in, central, europe, and, the, second, computer, in, the, world, to, be, sold, or, loaned, beaten, only, by, the, binac, which, never, worked, properly, after, it, was, delivered, other, computers, all, numbered, with, a, leading, z, up, to, z43, were, built, by, zuse, and, his, company, notable, are, the, z11, which, was, sold, to, the, optics, industry, and, to, universities, and, the, z22, the, first, computer, with, a, memory, based, on, magnetic, storage, unable, to, do, any, hardware, development, he, continued, working, on, plankalk, l, eventually, publishing, some, brief, excerpts, of, his, thesis, in, 1948, and, 1959, the, work, in, its, entirety, however, remained, unpublished, until, 1972, the, phd, thesis, was, submitted, at, university, of, augsburg, but, it, was, rejected, because, zuse, forgot, to, pay, the, dm, 400, university, enrollment, fee, the, rejection, did, not, bother, him, plankalk, l, slightly, influenced, the, design, of, algol, 58, but, was, itself, implemented, only, in, 1975, in, a, dissertation, by, joachim, hohmann, heinz, rutishauser, one, of, the, inventors, of, algol, wrote, the, very, first, attempt, to, devise, an, algorithmic, language, was, undertaken, in, 1948, by, k, zuse, his, notation, was, quite, general, but, the, proposal, never, attained, the, consideration, it, deserved, further, implementations, followed, in, 1998, and, then, in, 2000, by, a, team, from, the, free, university, of, berlin, donald, knuth, suggested, a, thought, experiment, what, might, have, happened, had, the, bombing, not, taken, place, and, had, the, phd, thesis, accordingly, been, published, as, planned, in, 1956, zuse, began, to, work, on, a, high, precision, large, format, plotter, it, was, demonstrated, at, the, 1961, hanover, fair, and, became, well, known, also, outside, of, the, technical, world, thanks, to, frieder, nake, s, pioneering, computer, art, work, other, plotters, designed, by, zuse, include, the, zuse, z90, and, zuse, z9004, in, 1967, zuse, suggested, that, the, universe, itself, is, running, on, a, cellular, automaton, or, similar, computational, structure, digital, physics, in, 1969, he, published, the, book, rechnender, raum, translated, into, english, as, calculating, space, between, 1989, and, 1995, zuse, conceptualized, and, created, a, purely, mechanical, extensible, modular, tower, automaton, he, named, helix, tower, helixturm, the, structure, is, based, on, a, gear, drive, that, employs, rotary, motion, e, g, provided, by, a, crank, to, assemble, modular, components, from, a, storage, space, elevating, a, tube, shaped, tower, the, process, is, reversible, and, inverting, the, input, direction, will, deconstruct, the, tower, and, store, the, components, in, 2009, the, deutsches, museum, restored, zuse, s, original, 1, 30, functional, model, that, can, be, extended, to, a, height, of, 2, 7, m, zuse, intended, the, full, construction, to, reach, a, height, of, 120, m, and, envisioned, it, for, use, with, wind, power, generators, and, radio, transmission, installations, between, 1987, and, 1989, zuse, recreated, the, z1, suffering, a, heart, attack, midway, through, the, project, it, cost, 800, 000, dm, approximately, 500, 000, and, required, four, individuals, including, zuse, to, assemble, it, funding, for, this, retrocomputing, project, was, provided, by, siemens, and, a, consortium, of, five, companies, konrad, zuse, married, gisela, brandes, in, january, 1945, employing, a, carriage, himself, dressed, in, tailcoat, and, top, hat, and, with, gisela, in, a, wedding, veil, for, zuse, attached, importance, to, a, noble, ceremony, their, son, horst, the, first, of, five, children, was, born, in, november, 1945, while, zuse, never, became, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, he, is, not, known, to, have, expressed, any, doubts, or, qualms, about, working, for, the, nazi, war, effort, much, later, he, suggested, that, in, modern, times, the, best, scientists, and, engineers, usually, have, to, choose, between, either, doing, their, work, for, more, or, less, questionable, business, and, military, interests, in, a, faustian, bargain, or, not, pursuing, their, line, of, work, at, all, after, zuse, retired, he, focused, on, his, hobby, of, painting, he, signed, his, paintings, as, kuno, see, zuse, was, an, atheist, 12, 13, zuse, died, on, 18, december, 1995, in, h, nfeld, hesse, near, fulda, from, heart, failure, zuse, received, several, awards, for, his, work, the, zuse, institute, berlin, is, named, in, his, honour, the, konrad, zuse, medal, of, the, gesellschaft, f, r, informatik, and, the, konrad, zuse, medal, of, the, zentralverband, des, deutschen, baugewerbes, central, association, of, german, construction, are, both, named, after, zuse, a, replica, of, the, z3, as, well, as, the, original, z4, is, in, the, deutsches, museum, in, munich, the, deutsches, technikmuseum, in, berlin, has, an, exhibition, devoted, to, zuse, displaying, twelve, of, his, machines, including, a, replica, of, the, z1, and, several, of, zuse, s, paintings, the, 100th, anniversary, of, his, birth, was, celebrated, by, exhibitions, lectures, and, workshops
