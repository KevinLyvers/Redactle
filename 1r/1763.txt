samuel, finley, breese, morse, april, 27, 1791, april, 2, 1872, was, an, american, inventor, and, painter, after, establishing, his, reputation, as, a, portrait, painter, morse, in, his, middle, age, contributed, to, the, invention, of, a, single, wire, telegraph, system, based, on, european, telegraphs, he, was, a, co, developer, of, morse, code, in, 1837, and, helped, to, develop, the, commercial, use, of, telegraphy, samuel, f, b, morse, was, born, in, charlestown, massachusetts, the, first, child, of, the, pastor, jedidiah, morse, 1761, 1826, who, was, also, a, geographer, and,

puritan, traditions, strict, observance, of, sabbath, among, other, things, and, believed, in, the, federalist, support, of, an, alliance, with, britain, and, a, strong, central, government, morse, strongly, believed, in, education, within, a, federalist, framework, alongside, the, instillation, of, calvinist, virtues, morals, and, prayers, for, his, first, son, his, first, ancestor, in, america, was, anthony, morse, of, marlborough, wiltshire, who, had, emigrated, to, america, in, 1635, and, settled, in, newbury, massachusetts, after, attending, phillips, academy, in, andover,

clothing, as, well, as, the, people, s, austere, facial, features, his, image, captured, the, psychology, of, the, federalists, calvinists, from, england, brought, to, north, america, ideas, of, religion, and, government, thus, linking, the, two, countries, this, work, attracted, the, attention, of, the, notable, artist, washington, allston, allston, wanted, morse, to, accompany, him, to, england, to, meet, the, artist, benjamin, west, allston, arranged, with, morse, s, father, a, three, year, stay, for, painting, study, in, england, the, two, men, set, sail, aboard, the, libya, on, july, 15, 1811, in, england, morse, perfected, his, painting, techniques, under, allston, s, watchful, eye, by, the, end, of, 1811, he, gained, admittance, to, the, royal, academy, at, the, academy, he, was, moved, by, the, art, of, the, renaissance, and, paid, close, attention, to, the, works, of, michelangelo, and, raphael, after, observing, and, practicing, life, drawing, and, absorbing, its, anatomical, demands, the, young, artist, produced, his, masterpiece, the, dying, hercules, he, first, made, a, sculpture, as, a, study, for, the, painting, to, some, the, dying, hercules, seemed, to, represent, a, political, statement, against, the, british, and, also, the, american, federalists, the, muscles, symbolized, the, strength, of, the, young, and, vibrant, united, states, versus, the, british, and, british, american, supporters, during, morse, s, time, in, britain, the, americans, and, british, were, engaged, in, the, war, of, 1812, both, societies, were, conflicted, over, loyalties, anti, federalist, americans, aligned, themselves, with, the, french, abhorred, the, british, and, believed, a, strong, central, government, to, be, inherently, dangerous, to, democracy, as, the, war, raged, on, morse, s, letters, to, his, parents, became, more, anti, federalist, in, tone, in, one, such, letter, morse, wrote, i, assert, that, the, federalists, in, the, northern, states, have, done, more, injury, to, their, country, by, their, violent, opposition, measures, than, a, french, alliance, could, their, proceedings, are, copied, into, the, english, papers, read, before, parliament, and, circulated, through, their, country, and, what, do, they, say, of, them, they, call, them, cowards, a, base, set, say, they, are, traitors, to, their, country, and, ought, to, be, hanged, like, traitors, although, jedidiah, morse, did, not, change, samuel, s, political, views, he, continued, as, an, influence, critics, believe, that, the, elder, morse, s, calvinist, ideas, are, integral, to, morse, s, judgment, of, jupiter, another, significant, work, completed, in, england, jupiter, is, shown, in, a, cloud, accompanied, by, his, eagle, with, his, hand, spread, above, the, parties, and, he, is, pronouncing, judgment, marpessa, with, an, expression, of, compunction, and, shame, is, throwing, herself, into, the, arms, of, her, husband, idas, who, tenderly, loved, marpessa, is, eagerly, rushing, forward, to, receive, her, while, apollo, stares, with, surprise, critics, have, suggested, that, jupiter, represents, god, s, omnipotence, watching, every, move, that, is, made, some, call, the, portrait, a, moral, teaching, by, morse, on, infidelity, although, marpessa, fell, victim, she, realized, that, her, eternal, salvation, was, important, and, desisted, from, her, wicked, ways, apollo, shows, no, remorse, for, what, he, did, but, stands, with, a, puzzled, look, many, american, paintings, throughout, the, early, nineteenth, century, had, religious, themes, and, morse, was, an, early, exemplar, of, this, judgment, of, jupiter, allowed, morse, to, express, his, support, of, anti, federalism, while, maintaining, his, strong, spiritual, convictions, benjamin, west, sought, to, present, the, jupiter, at, another, royal, academy, exhibition, but, morse, s, time, had, run, out, he, left, england, on, august, 21, 1815, to, return, to, the, united, states, and, begin, his, full, time, career, as, a, painter, the, decade, 1815, 1825, marked, significant, growth, in, morse, s, work, as, he, sought, to, capture, the, essence, of, america, s, culture, and, life, he, painted, the, federalist, former, president, john, adams, 1816, the, federalists, and, anti, federalists, clashed, over, dartmouth, college, morse, painted, portraits, of, francis, brown, the, college, s, president, and, judge, woodward, 1817, who, was, involved, in, bringing, the, dartmouth, case, before, the, u, s, supreme, court, morse, also, sought, commissions, among, the, elite, of, charleston, south, carolina, morse, s, 1818, painting, of, mrs, emma, quash, symbolized, the, opulence, of, charleston, the, young, artist, was, doing, well, for, himself, between, 1819, and, 1821, morse, went, through, great, changes, in, his, life, including, a, decline, in, commissions, due, to, the, panic, of, 1819, morse, was, commissioned, to, paint, president, james, monroe, in, 1820, he, embodied, jeffersonian, democracy, by, favoring, the, common, man, over, the, aristocrat, morse, had, moved, to, new, haven, his, commissions, for, the, house, of, representatives, 1821, and, a, portrait, of, the, marquis, de, lafayette, 1825, engaged, his, sense, of, democratic, nationalism, the, house, of, representatives, was, designed, to, capitalize, on, the, success, of, fran, ois, marius, granet, s, the, capuchin, chapel, in, rome, which, toured, the, united, states, extensively, throughout, the, 1820s, attracting, audiences, willing, to, pay, the, 25, cent, admission, fee, the, artist, chose, to, paint, the, house, of, representatives, in, a, similar, way, with, careful, attention, to, architecture, and, dramatic, lighting, he, also, wished, to, select, a, uniquely, american, topic, that, would, bring, glory, to, the, young, nation, his, subject, did, just, that, showing, american, democracy, in, action, he, traveled, to, washington, d, c, to, draw, the, architecture, of, the, new, capitol, and, placed, eighty, individuals, within, the, painting, he, chose, to, portray, a, night, scene, balancing, the, architecture, of, the, rotunda, with, the, figures, and, using, lamplight, to, highlight, the, work, pairs, of, people, those, who, stood, alone, individuals, bent, over, their, desks, working, were, each, painted, simply, but, with, faces, of, character, morse, chose, nighttime, to, convey, that, congress, dedication, to, the, principles, of, democracy, transcended, day, the, house, of, representatives, failed, to, draw, a, crowd, when, exhibited, in, new, york, city, in, 1823, by, contrast, john, trumbull, s, declaration, of, independence, had, won, popular, acclaim, a, few, years, earlier, viewers, may, have, felt, that, the, architecture, of, the, house, of, representatives, overshadows, the, individuals, making, it, hard, to, appreciate, the, drama, of, what, was, happening, morse, was, honored, to, paint, the, marquis, de, lafayette, the, leading, french, supporter, of, the, american, revolution, he, felt, compelled, to, paint, a, grand, portrait, of, the, man, who, helped, to, establish, a, free, and, independent, america, he, features, lafayette, against, a, magnificent, sunset, he, has, positioned, lafayette, to, the, right, of, three, pedestals, one, has, a, bust, of, benjamin, franklin, another, of, george, washington, and, the, third, seems, reserved, for, lafayette, a, peaceful, woodland, landscape, below, him, symbolized, american, tranquility, and, prosperity, as, it, approached, the, age, of, fifty, the, developing, friendship, between, morse, and, lafayette, and, their, discussions, of, the, revolutionary, war, affected, the, artist, after, his, return, to, new, york, city, in, 1826, he, helped, found, the, national, academy, of, design, in, new, york, city, he, served, as, the, academy, s, president, from, 1826, to, 1845, and, again, from, 1861, to, 1862, from, 1830, to, 1832, morse, traveled, and, studied, in, europe, to, improve, his, painting, skills, visiting, italy, switzerland, and, france, during, his, time, in, paris, he, developed, a, friendship, with, the, writer, james, fenimore, cooper, as, a, project, he, painted, miniature, copies, of, 38, of, the, louvre, s, famous, paintings, on, a, single, canvas, 6, ft, x, 9, ft, which, he, entitled, the, gallery, of, the, louvre, he, completed, the, work, upon, his, return, to, the, united, states, in, 1832, after, his, return, to, the, united, states, morse, was, appointed, professor, of, painting, and, sculpture, at, the, university, of, the, city, of, new, york, now, new, york, university, this, was, the, first, such, professorship, in, the, united, states, on, a, subsequent, visit, to, paris, in, 1839, morse, met, louis, daguerre, he, became, interested, in, the, latter, s, daguerreotype, the, first, practical, means, of, photography, morse, wrote, a, letter, to, the, new, york, observer, describing, the, invention, which, was, published, widely, in, the, american, press, and, provided, broad, awareness, of, the, new, technology, mathew, brady, one, of, the, earliest, photographers, in, american, history, famous, for, his, depictions, of, the, civil, war, initially, studied, under, morse, and, later, took, photographs, of, him, some, of, morse, s, paintings, and, sculptures, are, on, display, at, his, locust, grove, estate, in, poughkeepsie, new, york, while, returning, by, ship, from, europe, in, 1832, morse, encountered, charles, thomas, jackson, of, boston, a, man, who, was, well, schooled, in, electromagnetism, witnessing, various, experiments, with, jackson, s, electromagnet, morse, developed, the, concept, of, a, single, wire, telegraph, he, set, aside, the, painting, he, had, been, working, on, the, gallery, of, the, louvre, the, original, morse, telegraph, submitted, with, his, patent, application, is, part, of, the, collections, of, the, national, museum, of, american, history, at, the, smithsonian, institution, in, time, the, morse, code, that, he, developed, would, become, the, primary, language, of, telegraphy, in, the, world, it, is, still, the, standard, for, rhythmic, transmission, of, data, meanwhile, william, cooke, and, professor, charles, wheatstone, had, learned, of, the, wilhelm, weber, and, carl, gauss, electromagnetic, telegraph, in, 1833, they, had, reached, the, stage, of, launching, a, commercial, telegraph, prior, to, morse, despite, starting, later, in, england, cooke, became, fascinated, by, electrical, telegraphy, in, 1836, four, years, after, morse, aided, by, his, greater, financial, resources, cooke, abandoned, his, primary, subject, of, anatomy, and, built, a, small, electrical, telegraph, within, three, weeks, wheatstone, also, was, experimenting, with, telegraphy, and, most, importantly, understood, that, a, single, large, battery, would, not, carry, a, telegraphic, signal, over, long, distances, he, theorized, that, numerous, small, batteries, were, far, more, successful, and, efficient, in, this, task, wheatstone, was, building, on, the, primary, research, of, joseph, henry, an, american, physicist, cooke, and, wheatstone, formed, a, partnership, and, patented, the, electrical, telegraph, in, may, 1837, and, within, a, short, time, had, provided, the, great, western, railway, with, a, 13, mile, 21, km, stretch, of, telegraph, however, within, a, few, years, cooke, and, wheatstone, s, multiple, wire, signaling, method, would, be, overtaken, by, morse, s, cheaper, method, in, an, 1848, letter, to, a, friend, morse, describes, how, vigorously, he, fought, to, be, called, the, sole, inventor, of, the, electromagnetic, telegraph, despite, the, previous, inventions, i, have, been, so, constantly, under, the, necessity, of, watching, the, movements, of, the, most, unprincipled, set, of, pirates, i, have, ever, known, that, all, my, time, has, been, occupied, in, defense, in, putting, evidence, into, something, like, legal, shape, that, i, am, the, inventor, of, the, electro, magnetic, telegraph, would, you, have, believed, it, ten, years, ago, that, a, question, could, be, raised, on, that, subject, morse, encountered, the, problem, of, getting, a, telegraphic, signal, to, carry, over, more, than, a, few, hundred, yards, of, wire, his, breakthrough, came, from, the, insights, of, professor, leonard, gale, who, taught, chemistry, at, new, york, university, he, was, a, personal, friend, of, joseph, henry, with, gale, s, help, morse, introduced, extra, circuits, or, relays, at, frequent, intervals, and, was, soon, able, to, send, a, message, through, ten, miles, 16, km, of, wire, this, was, the, great, breakthrough, he, had, been, seeking, morse, and, gale, were, soon, joined, by, alfred, vail, an, enthusiastic, young, man, with, excellent, skills, insights, and, money, at, the, speedwell, ironworks, in, morristown, new, jersey, on, january, 11, 1838, morse, and, vail, made, the, first, public, demonstration, of, the, electric, telegraph, although, morse, and, alfred, vail, had, done, most, of, the, research, and, development, in, the, ironworks, facilities, they, chose, a, nearby, factory, house, as, the, demonstration, site, without, the, repeater, morse, devised, a, system, of, electromagnetic, relays, this, was, the, key, innovation, as, it, freed, the, technology, from, being, limited, by, distance, in, sending, messages, the, range, of, the, telegraph, was, limited, to, two, miles, 3, 2, km, and, the, inventors, had, pulled, two, miles, 3, 2, km, of, wires, inside, the, factory, house, through, an, elaborate, scheme, the, first, public, transmission, with, the, message, a, patient, waiter, is, no, loser, was, witnessed, by, a, mostly, local, crowd, morse, traveled, to, washington, d, c, in, 1838, seeking, federal, sponsorship, for, a, telegraph, line, but, was, not, successful, he, went, to, europe, seeking, both, sponsorship, and, patents, but, in, london, discovered, that, cooke, and, wheatstone, had, already, established, priority, after, his, return, to, the, us, morse, finally, gained, financial, backing, by, maine, congressman, francis, ormand, jonathan, smith, this, funding, may, be, the, first, instance, of, government, support, to, a, private, researcher, especially, funding, for, applied, as, opposed, to, basic, or, theoretical, research, morse, made, his, last, trip, to, washington, d, c, in, december, 1842, stringing, wires, between, two, committee, rooms, in, the, capitol, and, sent, messages, back, and, forth, to, demonstrate, his, telegraph, system, congress, appropriated, 30, 000, equivalent, to, 981, 000, in, 2023, in, 1843, for, construction, of, an, experimental, 38, mile, 61, km, telegraph, line, between, washington, d, c, and, baltimore, along, the, right, of, way, of, the, baltimore, and, ohio, railroad, an, impressive, demonstration, occurred, on, may, 1, 1844, when, news, of, the, whig, party, s, nomination, of, henry, clay, for, u, s, president, was, telegraphed, from, the, party, s, convention, in, baltimore, to, the, capitol, building, in, washington, on, may, 24, 1844, the, line, was, officially, opened, as, morse, sent, the, now, famous, words, what, hath, god, wrought, from, the, supreme, court, chamber, in, the, basement, of, the, u, s, capitol, building, in, washington, d, c, to, the, b, o, s, mount, clare, station, in, baltimore, annie, ellsworth, chose, these, words, from, the, bible, numbers, 23, 23, her, father, u, s, patent, commissioner, henry, leavitt, ellsworth, had, championed, morse, s, invention, and, secured, early, funding, for, it, his, telegraph, could, transmit, thirty, characters, per, minute, in, may, 1845, the, magnetic, telegraph, company, was, formed, in, order, to, build, telegraph, lines, from, new, york, city, toward, philadelphia, boston, buffalo, and, the, mississippi, telegraphic, lines, rapidly, spread, throughout, the, united, states, in, the, next, few, years, with, 12, 000, miles, of, wire, laid, by, 1850, morse, at, one, time, adopted, wheatstone, and, carl, august, von, steinheil, s, idea, of, broadcasting, an, electrical, telegraph, signal, through, a, body, of, water, or, down, steel, railroad, tracks, or, anything, conductive, he, went, to, great, lengths, to, win, a, lawsuit, for, the, right, to, be, called, inventor, of, the, telegraph, and, promoted, himself, as, being, an, inventor, but, alfred, vail, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, morse, code, which, was, based, on, earlier, codes, for, the, electromagnetic, telegraph, morse, received, a, patent, for, the, telegraph, in, 1847, at, the, old, beylerbeyi, palace, the, present, beylerbeyi, palace, was, built, in, 1861, 1865, on, the, same, location, in, istanbul, which, was, issued, by, sultan, abd, lmecid, who, personally, tested, the, new, invention, he, was, elected, an, associate, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1849, the, original, patent, went, to, the, breese, side, of, the, family, after, the, death, of, samuel, morse, in, 1856, morse, went, to, copenhagen, and, visited, the, thorvaldsens, museum, where, the, sculptor, s, grave, is, in, the, inner, courtyard, he, was, received, by, king, frederick, vii, who, decorated, him, with, the, order, of, the, dannebrog, for, the, telegraph, morse, expressed, his, wish, to, donate, his, thorvaldsen, portrait, from, 1831, in, rome, to, the, king, the, thorvaldsen, portrait, today, belongs, to, margrethe, ii, of, denmark, the, morse, telegraphic, apparatus, was, officially, adopted, as, the, standard, for, european, telegraphy, in, 1851, only, the, united, kingdom, with, its, extensive, overseas, empire, kept, the, needle, telegraph, of, cooke, and, wheatstone, in, 1858, morse, introduced, wired, communication, to, latin, america, when, he, established, a, telegraph, system, in, puerto, rico, then, a, spanish, colony, morse, s, oldest, daughter, susan, walker, morse, 1819, 1885, would, often, visit, her, uncle, charles, pickering, walker, who, owned, the, hacienda, concordia, in, the, town, of, guayama, during, one, of, her, visits, she, met, edward, lind, a, danish, merchant, who, worked, in, his, brother, in, law, s, hacienda, la, henriqueta, in, the, town, of, arroyo, they, later, married, lind, purchased, the, hacienda, from, his, sister, when, she, became, a, widow, morse, who, often, spent, his, winters, at, the, hacienda, with, his, daughter, and, son, in, law, set, a, two, mile, telegraph, line, connecting, his, son, in, law, s, hacienda, to, their, house, in, arroyo, the, line, was, inaugurated, on, march, 1, 1859, in, a, ceremony, flanked, by, the, spanish, and, american, flags, the, first, words, transmitted, by, samuel, morse, that, day, in, puerto, rico, were, puerto, rico, beautiful, jewel, when, you, are, linked, with, the, other, jewels, of, the, antilles, in, the, necklace, of, the, world, s, telegraph, yours, will, not, shine, less, brilliantly, in, the, crown, of, your, queen, morse, was, a, leader, in, the, anti, catholic, and, anti, immigration, movement, of, the, mid, 19th, century, in, 1836, he, ran, unsuccessfully, for, mayor, of, new, york, under, the, anti, immigrant, nativist, party, s, banner, receiving, only, 1, 496, votes, when, morse, visited, rome, he, allegedly, refused, to, take, his, hat, off, in, the, presence, of, the, pope, morse, worked, to, unite, protestants, against, catholic, institutions, including, schools, wanted, to, forbid, catholics, from, holding, public, office, and, promoted, changing, immigration, laws, to, limit, immigration, from, catholic, countries, on, this, topic, he, wrote, we, must, first, stop, the, leak, in, the, ship, through, which, muddy, waters, from, without, threaten, to, sink, us, he, wrote, numerous, letters, to, the, new, york, observer, his, brother, sidney, was, the, editor, at, the, time, urging, people, to, fight, the, perceived, catholic, menace, these, were, widely, reprinted, in, other, newspapers, among, other, claims, he, believed, that, the, austrian, government, and, catholic, aid, organizations, were, subsidizing, catholic, immigration, to, the, united, states, in, order, to, gain, control, of, the, country, in, his, foreign, conspiracy, against, the, liberties, of, the, united, states, morse, wrote, surely, american, protestants, freemen, have, discernment, enough, to, discover, beneath, them, the, cloven, foot, of, this, subtle, foreign, heresy, they, will, see, that, popery, is, now, what, it, has, ever, been, a, system, of, the, darkest, political, intrigue, and, despotism, cloaking, itself, to, avoid, attack, under, the, sacred, name, of, religion, they, will, be, deeply, impressed, with, the, truth, that, popery, is, a, political, as, well, as, a, religious, system, that, in, this, respect, it, differs, totally, from, all, other, sects, from, all, other, forms, of, religion, in, the, country, in, the, same, book, published, in, 1835, under,

after, a, couple, of, years, differences, regarding, questions, of, jurisdiction, arose, between, him, and, ambrose, mar, chal, archbishop, of, baltimore, kelly, was, offered, the, recently, vacant, see, of, waterford, and, lismore, in, his, homeland, in, the, 1850s, morse, became, well, known, as, a, defender, of, slavery, considering, it, to, be, sanctioned, by, god, in, his, treatise, an, argument, on, the, ethical, position, of, slavery, he, wrote, my, creed, on, the, subject, of, slavery, is, short, slavery, per, se, is, not, sin, it, is, a, social, condition, ordained, from, the, beginning, of, the, world, for, the, wisest, purposes, benevolent, and, disciplinary, by, divine, wisdom, the, mere, holding, of, slaves, therefore, is, a, condition, having, per, se, nothing, of, moral, character, in, it, any, more, than, the, being, a, parent, or, employer, or, ruler, in, the, united, states, morse, held, his, telegraph, patent, for, many, years, but, it, was, both, ignored, and, contested, in, 1853, the, telegraph, patent, case, o, reilly, v, morse, came, before, the, u, s, supreme, court, where, after, very, lengthy, investigation, chief, justice, roger, b, taney, ruled, that, morse, had, been, the, first, to, combine, the, battery, electromagnetism, the, electromagnet, and, the, correct, battery, configuration, into, a, workable, practical, telegraph, however, in, spite, of, this, clear, ruling, morse, still, received, no, official, recognition, from, the, united, states, government, the, supreme, court, did, not, accept, all, of, morse, s, claims, the, o, reilly, v, morse, case, has, become, widely, known, among, patent, lawyers, because, the, supreme, court, explicitly, denied, morse, s, claim, 8, for, any, and, all, use, of, the, electromagnetic, force, for, purposes, of, transmitting, intelligible, signals, to, any, distance, the, supreme, court, sustained, however, morse, s, claim, to, such, telecommunication, when, effectuated, by, means, of, morse, s, inventive, repeater, apparatus, this, was, an, electrical, circuit, in, which, a, cascade, of, many, sets, comprising, a, relay, and, a, battery, were, connected, in, series, so, that, when, each, relay, closed, it, closed, a, circuit, to, cause, the, next, battery, to, power, the, succeeding, relay, as, suggested, in, the, accompanying, figure, this, caused, morse, s, signal, to, pass, along, the, cascade, without, degrading, into, noise, as, its, amplitude, decreased, with, the, distance, traveled, each, time, the, amplitude, of, the, signal, approaches, the, noise, level, the, repeater, boosts, the, signal, amplitude, well, above, the, noise, level, this, use, of, repeaters, permitted, a, message, to, be, sent, to, great, distances, which, was, previously, not, feasible, the, supreme, court, thus, held, that, morse, could, properly, claim, a, patent, monopoly, on, the, system, or, process, of, transmitting, signals, at, any, distance, by, means, of, the, repeater, circuitry, indicated, above, but, he, could, not, properly, claim, a, monopoly, over, any, and, all, uses, of, electromagnetic, force, to, transmit, signals, the, apparatus, limitation, in, the, former, type, of, claim, limited, the, patent, monopoly, to, what, morse, taught, and, gave, the, world, the, lack, of, that, limitation, in, the, latter, type, of, claim, i, e, claim, 8, both, gave, morse, more, than, was, commensurate, with, what, he, had, contributed, to, society, and, discouraged, the, inventive, efforts, of, others, who, might, come, up, with, different, and, or, better, ways, to, send, signals, at, a, distance, using, the, electromagnetic, force, the, problem, that, morse, faced, the, deterioration, of, the, signal, with, distance, and, how, he, solved, it, is, discussed, in, more, detail, in, the, article, o, reilly, v, morse, in, summary, the, solution, as, the, supreme, court, stated, was, the, repeater, apparatus, described, in, the, preceding, paragraphs, the, importance, of, this, legal, precedent, in, patent, law, cannot, be, overstated, as, it, became, the, foundation, of, the, law, governing, the, eligibility, of, computer, program, implemented, inventions, as, well, as, inventions, implementing, natural, laws, to, be, granted, patents, assisted, by, the, american, ambassador, in, paris, the, governments, of, europe, were, approached, about, their, long, neglect, of, morse, while, their, countries, were, using, his, invention, there, was, a, widespread, recognition, that, something, must, be, done, and, in, 1858, morse, was, awarded, the, sum, of, 400, 000, french, francs, equivalent, to, about, 80, 000, at, the, time, by, the, governments, of, france, austria, belgium, the, netherlands, piedmont, russia, sweden, tuscany, and, the, ottoman, empire, each, of, which, contributed, a, share, according, to, the, number, of, morse, instruments, in, use, in, each, country, in, 1858, he, was, also, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, morse, lent, his, support, to, cyrus, west, field, s, ambitious, plan, to, construct, the, first, transoceanic, telegraph, line, morse, had, experimented, with, underwater, telegraph, circuits, since, 1842, he, invested, 10, 000, in, field, s, atlantic, telegraph, company, took, a, seat, on, its, board, of, directors, and, was, appointed, honorary, electrician, in, 1856, morse, traveled, to, london, to, help, charles, tilston, bright, and, edward, whitehouse, test, a, 2, 000, mile, length, of, spooled, cable, after, the, first, two, cable, laying, attempts, failed, field, reorganized, the, project, removing, morse, from, direct, involvement, though, the, cable, broke, three, times, during, the, third, attempt, it, was, successfully, repaired, and, the, first, transatlantic, telegraph, messages, were, sent, in, 1858, the, cable, failed, after, just, three, months, of, use, though, field, had, to, wait, out, the, civil, war, the, cable, laid, in, 1866, proved, more, durable, and, the, era, of, reliable, transatlantic, telegraph, service, had, begun, in, addition, to, the, telegraph, morse, invented, a, marble, cutting, machine, that, could, carve, three, dimensional, sculptures, in, marble, or, stone, he, could, not, patent, it, however, because, of, an, existing, 1820, thomas, blanchard, design, samuel, morse, gave, large, sums, to, charity, he, also, became, interested, in, the, relationship, of, science, and, religion, and, provided, the, funds, to, establish, a, lectureship, on, the, relation, of, the, bible, to, the, sciences, though, he, was, rarely, awarded, any, royalties, for, the, later, uses, and, implementations, of, his, inventions, he, was, able, to, live, comfortably, morsemere, in, ridgefield, new, jersey, takes, its, name, from, morse, who, had, bought, property, there, to, build, a, home, but, died, before, its, completion, he, died, of, meningitis, in, new, york, city, on, april, 2, 1872, and, was, interred, at, green, wood, cemetery, in, brooklyn, by, the, time, of, his, death, his, estate, was, valued, at, some, 500, 000, 12, 7, million, today, in, his, will, he, provided, an, award, medal, that, is, presented, annually, by, the, new, york, university, to, one, undergraduate, student, who, shows, special, ability, in, physics, morse, was, elected, a, member, of, the, american, antiquarian, society, in, 1815, despite, honors, and, financial, awards, received, from, foreign, countries, there, was, no, such, recognition, in, the, u, s, until, he, neared, the, end, of, his, life, when, on, june, 10, 1871, a, bronze, statue, of, samuel, morse, was, unveiled, in, central, park, new, york, city, an, engraved, portrait, of, morse, appeared, on, the, reverse, side, of, the, united, states, two, dollar, bill, silver, certificate, series, of, 1896, he, was, depicted, along, with, robert, fulton, an, example, can, be, seen, on, the, website, of, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, san, francisco, s, website, in, their, american, currency, exhibit, a, blue, plaque, was, erected, to, commemorate, him, at, 141, cleveland, street, london, where, he, lived, from, 1812, to, 1815, in, 1848, morse, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, according, to, his, the, new, york, times, obituary, published, on, april, 3, 1872, morse, received, respectively, the, decoration, of, the, atiq, nishan, i, iftikhar, english, order, of, glory, set, in, diamonds, from, sultan, abd, lmecid, of, turkey, c, 1847, a, golden,
