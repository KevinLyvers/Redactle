aristotle, greek, aristot, l, s, 384, 322, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, philosopher, and, polymath, his, writings, cover, a, broad, range, of, subjects, spanning, the, natural, sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and, the, arts, as, the, founder, of, the, peripatetic, school, of, philosophy, in, the, lyceum, in, athens, he, began, the, wider, aristotelian, tradition, that, followed, which, set, the, groundwork, for, the, development, of, modern, science, little, is, known, about, aristotle, s, life, he, was, born, in, the, city, of, stagira, in, northern, greece, during, the, classical, period, his, father, nicomachus, died, when, aristotle, was, a, child, and, he, was, brought, up, by, a, guardian, at, 17, or, 18, he, joined, plato, s, academy, in, athens, and, remained, there, until, the, age, of, 37, c, 347, bc, shortly, after, plato, died, aristotle, left, athens, and, at, the, request, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, tutored, his, son, alexander, the, great, beginning, in, 343, bc, he, established, a, library, in, the, lyceum, which, helped, him, to, produce, many, of, his, hundreds, of, books, on, papyrus, scrolls, though, aristotle, wrote, many, treatises, and, dialogues, for, publication, only, around, a, third, of, his, original, output, has, survived, none, of, it, intended, for, publication, aristotle, provided, a, complex, synthesis, of, the, various, philosophies, existing, prior, to, him, his, teachings, and, methods, of, inquiry, have, had, a, significant, impact, across, the, world, and, remain, a, subject, of, contemporary, philosophical, discussion, aristotle, s, views, profoundly, shaped, medieval, scholarship, the, influence, of, his, physical, science, extended, from, late, antiquity, and, the, early, middle, ages, into, the, renaissance, and, was, not, replaced, systematically, until, the, enlightenment, and, theories, such, as, classical, mechanics, were, developed, he, influenced, judeo, islamic, philosophies, during, the, middle, ages, as, well, as, christian, theology, especially, the, neoplatonism, of, the, early, church, and, the, scholastic, tradition, of, the, catholic, church, aristotle, was, revered, among, medieval, muslim, scholars, as, the, first, teacher, and, among, medieval, christians, like, thomas, aquinas, as, simply, the, philosopher, while, the, poet, dante, called, him, the, master, of, those, who, know, his, works, contain, the, earliest, known, formal, study, of, logic, and, were, studied, by, medieval, scholars, such, as, peter, abelard, and, jean, buridan, aristotle, s, influence, on, logic, continued, well, into, the, 19th, century, in, addition, his, ethics, although, always, influential, gained, renewed, interest, with, the, modern, advent, of, virtue, ethics, in, general, the, details, of, aristotle, s, life, are, not, well, established, the, biographies, written, in, ancient, times, are, often, speculative, and, historians, only, agree, on, a, few, salient, points, aristotle, was, born, in, 384, bc, in, stagira, chalcidice, about, 55, km, 34, miles, east, of, modern, day, thessaloniki, his, father, nicomachus, was, the, personal, physician, to, king, amyntas, of, macedon, while, he, was, young, aristotle, learned, about, biology, and, medical, information, which, was, taught, by, his, father, both, of, aristotle, s, parents, died, when, he, was, about, thirteen, and, proxenus, of, atarneus, became, his, guardian, although, little, information, about, aristotle, s, childhood, has, survived, he, probably, spent, some, time, within, the, macedonian, palace, making, his, first, connections, with, the, macedonian, monarchy, at, the, age, of, seventeen, or, eighteen, aristotle, moved, to, athens, to, continue, his, education, at, plato, s, academy, he, probably, experienced, the, eleusinian, mysteries, as, he, wrote, when, describing, the, sights, one, viewed, at, the, eleusinian, mysteries, to, experience, is, to, learn, aristotle, remained, in, athens, for, nearly, twenty, years, before, leaving, in, 348, 47, bc, the, traditional, story, about, his, departure, records, that, he, was, disappointed, with, the, academy, s, direction, after, control, passed, to, plato, s, nephew, speusippus, although, it, is, possible, that, he, feared, the, anti, macedonian, sentiments, in, athens, at, that, time, and, left, before, plato, died, aristotle, then, accompanied, xenocrates, to, the, court, of, his, friend, hermias, of, atarneus, in, asia, minor, after, the, death, of, hermias, aristotle, travelled, with, his, pupil, theophrastus, to, the, island, of, lesbos, where, together, they, researched, the, botany, and, zoology, of, the, island, and, its, sheltered, lagoon, while, in, lesbos, aristotle, married, pythias, either, hermias, s, adoptive, daughter, or, niece, they, had, a, daughter, whom, they, also, named, pythias, in, 343, bc, aristotle, was, invited, by, philip, ii, of, macedon, to, become, the, tutor, to, his, son, alexander, aristotle, was, appointed, as, the, head, of, the, royal, academy, of, macedon, during, aristotle, s, time, in, the, macedonian, court, he, gave, lessons, not, only, to, alexander, but, also, to, two, other, future, kings, ptolemy, and, cassander, aristotle, encouraged, alexander, toward, eastern, conquest, and, aristotle, s, own, attitude, towards, persia, was, unabashedly, ethnocentric, in, one, famous, example, he, counsels, alexander, to, be, a, leader, to, the, greeks, and, a, despot, to, the, barbarians, to, look, after, the, former, as, after, friends, and, relatives, and, to, deal, with, the, latter, as, with, beasts, or, plants, by, 335, bc, aristotle, had, returned, to, athens, establishing, his, own, school, there, known, as, the, lyceum, aristotle, conducted, courses, at, the, school, for, the, next, twelve, years, while, in, athens, his, wife, pythias, died, and, aristotle, became, involved, with, herpyllis, of, stagira, they, had, a, son, whom, aristotle, named, after, his, father, nicomachus, if, the, suda, an, uncritical, compilation, from, the, middle, ages, is, accurate, he, may, also, have, had, an, er, menos, palaephatus, of, abydus, this, period, in, athens, between, 335, and, 323, bc, is, when, aristotle, is, believed, to, have, composed, many, of, his, works, he, wrote, many, dialogues, of, which, only, fragments, have, survived, those, works, that, have, survived, are, in, treatise, form, and, were, not, for, the, most, part, intended, for, widespread, publication, they, are, generally, thought, to, be, lecture, aids, for, his, students, his, most, important, treatises, include, physics, metaphysics, nicomachean, ethics, politics, on, the, soul, and, poetics, aristotle, studied, and, made, significant, contributions, to, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and, theatre, near, the, end, of, his, life, alexander, and, aristotle, became, estranged, over, alexander, s, relationship, with, persia, and, persians, a, widespread, tradition, in, antiquity, suspected, aristotle, of, playing, a, role, in, alexander, s, death, but, the, only, evidence, of, this, is, an, unlikely, claim, made, some, six, years, after, the, death, following, alexander, s, death, anti, macedonian, sentiment, in, athens, was, rekindled, in, 322, bc, demophilus, and, eurymedon, the, hierophant, reportedly, denounced, aristotle, for, impiety, prompting, him, to, flee, to, his, mother, s, family, estate, in, chalcis, on, euboea, at, which, occasion, he, was, said, to, have, stated, i, will, not, allow, the, athenians, to, sin, twice, against, philosophy, a, reference, to, athens, s, trial, and, execution, of, socrates, he, died, in, chalcis, euboea, of, natural, causes, later, that, same, year, having, named, his, student, antipater, as, his, chief, executor, and, leaving, a, will, in, which, he, asked, to, be, buried, next, to, his, wife, with, the, prior, analytics, aristotle, is, credited, with, the, earliest, study, of, formal, logic, and, his, conception, of, it, was, the, dominant, form, of, western, logic, until, 19th, century, advances, in, mathematical, logic, kant, stated, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, that, with, aristotle, logic, reached, its, completion, most, of, aristotle, s, work, is, probably, not, in, its, original, form, because, it, was, most, likely, edited, by, students, and, later, lecturers, the, logical, works, of, aristotle, were, compiled, into, a, set, of, six, books, called, the, organon, around, 40, bc, by, andronicus, of, rhodes, or, others, among, his, followers, the, books, are, the, order, of, the, books, or, the, teachings, from, which, they, are, composed, is, not, certain, but, this, list, was, derived, from, analysis, of, aristotle, s, writings, it, goes, from, the, basics, the, analysis, of, simple, terms, in, the, categories, the, analysis, of, propositions, and, their, elementary, relations, in, on, interpretation, to, the, study, of, more, complex, forms, namely, syllogisms, in, the, analytics, and, dialectics, in, the, topics, and, sophistical, refutations, the, first, three, treatises, form, the, core, of, the, logical, theory, stricto, sensu, the, grammar, of, the, language, of, logic, and, the, correct, rules, of, reasoning, the, rhetoric, is, not, conventionally, included, but, it, states, that, it, relies, on, the, topics, what, is, today, called, aristotelian, logic, with, its, types, of, syllogism, methods, of, logical, argument, aristotle, himself, would, have, labelled, analytics, the, term, logic, he, reserved, to, mean, dialectics, the, word, metaphysics, appears, to, have, been, coined, by, the, first, century, ad, editor, who, assembled, various, small, selections, of, aristotle, s, works, to, the, treatise, we, know, by, the, name, metaphysics, aristotle, called, it, first, philosophy, and, distinguished, it, from, mathematics, and, natural, science, physics, as, the, contemplative, theoretik, philosophy, which, is, theological, and, studies, the, divine, he, wrote, in, his, metaphysics, 1026a16, if, there, were, no, other, independent, things, besides, the, composite, natural, ones, the, study, of, nature, would, be, the, primary, kind, of, knowledge, but, if, there, is, some, motionless, independent, thing, the, knowledge, of, this, precedes, it, and, is, first, philosophy, and, it, is, universal, in, just, this, way, because, it, is, first, and, it, belongs, to, this, sort, of, philosophy, to, study, being, as, being, both, what, it, is, and, what, belongs, to, it, just, by, virtue, of, being, aristotle, examines, the, concepts, of, substance, ousia, and, essence, to, ti, n, einai, the, what, it, was, to, be, in, his, metaphysics, book, vii, and, he, concludes, that, a, particular, substance, is, a, combination, of, both, matter, and, form, a, philosophical, theory, called, hylomorphism, in, book, viii, he, distinguishes, the, matter, of, the, substance, as, the, substratum, or, the, stuff, of, which, it, is, composed, for, example, the, matter, of, a, house, is, the, bricks, stones, timbers, etc, or, whatever, constitutes, the, potential, house, while, the, form, of, the, substance, is, the, actual, house, namely, covering, for, bodies, and, chattels, or, any, other, differentia, that, let, us, define, something, as, a, house, the, formula, that, gives, the, components, is, the, account, of, the, matter, and, the, formula, that, gives, the, differentia, is, the, account, of, the, form, like, his, teacher, plato, aristotle, s, philosophy, aims, at, the, universal, aristotle, s, ontology, places, the, universal, katholou, in, particulars, kath, hekaston, things, in, the, world, whereas, for, plato, the, universal, is, a, separately, existing, form, which, actual, things, imitate, for, aristotle, form, is, still, what, phenomena, are, based, on, but, is, instantiated, in, a, particular, substance, plato, argued, that, all, things, have, a, universal, form, which, could, be, either, a, property, or, a, relation, to, other, things, when, one, looks, at, an, apple, for, example, one, sees, an, apple, and, one, can, also, analyse, a, form, of, an, apple, in, this, distinction, there, is, a, particular, apple, and, a, universal, form, of, an, apple, moreover, one, can, place, an, apple, next, to, a, book, so, that, one, can, speak, of, both, the, book, and, apple, as, being, next, to, each, other, plato, argued, that, there, are, some, universal, forms, that, are, not, a, part, of, particular, things, for, example, it, is, possible, that, there, is, no, particular, good, in, existence, but, good, is, still, a, proper, universal, form, aristotle, disagreed, with, plato, on, this, point, arguing, that, all, universals, are, instantiated, at, some, period, of, time, and, that, there, are, no, universals, that, are, unattached, to, existing, things, in, addition, aristotle, disagreed, with, plato, about, the, location, of, universals, where, plato, spoke, of, the, forms, as, existing, separately, from, the, things, that, participate, in, them, aristotle, maintained, that, universals, exist, within, each, thing, on, which, each, universal, is, predicated, so, according, to, aristotle, the, form, of, apple, exists, within, each, apple, rather, than, in, the, world, of, the, forms, concerning, the, nature, of, change, kinesis, and, its, causes, as, he, outlines, in, his, physics, and, on, generation, and, corruption, 319b, 320a, he, distinguishes, coming, to, be, genesis, also, translated, as, generation, from, coming, to, be, is, a, change, where, the, substrate, of, the, thing, that, has, undergone, the, change, has, itself, changed, in, that, particular, change, he, introduces, the, concept, of, potentiality, dynamis, and, actuality, entelecheia, in, association, with, the, matter, and, the, form, referring, to, potentiality, this, is, what, a, thing, is, capable, of, doing, or, being, acted, upon, if, the, conditions, are, right, and, it, is, not, prevented, by, something, else, for, example, the, seed, of, a, plant, in, the, soil, is, potentially, dynamei, a, plant, and, if, it, is, not, prevented, by, something, it, will, become, a, plant, potentially, beings, can, either, act, poiein, or, be, acted, upon, paschein, which, can, be, either, innate, or, learned, for, example, the, eyes, possess, the, potentiality, of, sight, innate, being, acted, upon, while, the, capability, of, playing, the, flute, can, be, possessed, by, learning, exercise, acting, actuality, is, the, fulfilment, of, the, end, of, the, potentiality, because, the, end, telos, is, the, principle, of, every, change, and, potentiality, exists, for, the, sake, of, the, end, actuality, accordingly, is, the, end, referring, then, to, the, previous, example, it, can, be, said, that, an, actuality, is, when, a, plant, does, one, of, the, activities, that, plants, do, for, that, for, the, sake, of, which, to, hou, heneka, a, thing, is, is, its, principle, and, the, becoming, is, for, the, sake, of, the, end, and, the, actuality, is, the, end, and, it, is, for, the, sake, of, this, that, the, potentiality, is, acquired, for, animals, do, not, see, in, order, that, they, may, have, sight, but, they, have, sight, that, they, may, see, in, summary, the, matter, used, to, make, a, house, has, potentiality, to, be, a, house, and, both, the, activity, of, building, and, the, form, of, the, final, house, are, actualities, which, is, also, a, final, cause, or, end, then, aristotle, proceeds, and, concludes, that, the, actuality, is, prior, to, potentiality, in, formula, in, time, and, in, substantiality, with, this, definition, of, the, particular, substance, i, e, matter, and, form, aristotle, tries, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, unity, of, the, beings, for, example, what, is, it, that, makes, a, man, one, since, according, to, plato, there, are, two, ideas, animal, and, biped, how, then, is, man, a, unity, however, according, to, aristotle, the, potential, being, matter, and, the, actual, one, form, are, one, and, the, same, aristotle, s, immanent, realism, means, his, epistemology, is, based, on, the, study, of, things, that, exist, or, happen, in, the, world, and, rises, to, knowledge, of, the, universal, whereas, for, plato, epistemology, begins, with, knowledge, of, universal, forms, or, ideas, and, descends, to, knowledge, of, particular, imitations, of, these, aristotle, uses, induction, from, examples, alongside, deduction, whereas, plato, relies, on, deduction, from, a, priori, principles, aristotle, s, natural, philosophy, spans, a, wide, range, of, natural, phenomena, including, those, now, covered, by, physics, biology, and, other, natural, sciences, in, aristotle, s, terminology, natural, philosophy, is, a, branch, of, philosophy, examining, the, phenomena, of, the, natural, world, and, includes, fields, that, would, be, regarded, today, as, physics, biology, and, other, natural, sciences, aristotle, s, work, encompassed, virtually, all, facets, of, intellectual, inquiry, aristotle, makes, philosophy, in, the, broad, sense, coextensive, with, reasoning, which, he, also, would, describe, as, science, however, his, use, of, the, term, science, carries, a, different, meaning, than, that, covered, by, the, term, scientific, method, for, aristotle, all, science, dianoia, is, either, practical, poetical, or, theoretical, metaphysics, 1025b25, his, practical, science, includes, ethics, and, politics, his, poetical, science, means, the, study, of, fine, arts, including, poetry, his, theoretical, science, covers, physics, mathematics, and, metaphysics, in, his, on, generation, and, corruption, aristotle, related, each, of, the, four, elements, proposed, earlier, by, empedocles, earth, water, air, and, fire, to, two, of, the, four, sensible, qualities, hot, cold, wet, and, dry, in, the, empedoclean, scheme, all, matter, was, made, of, the, four, elements, in, differing, proportions, aristotle, s, scheme, added, the, heavenly, aether, the, divine, substance, of, the, heavenly, spheres, stars, and, planets, aristotle, describes, two, kinds, of, motion, violent, or, unnatural, motion, such, as, that, of, a, thrown, stone, in, the, physics, 254b10, and, natural, motion, such, as, of, a, falling, object, in, on, the, heavens, 300a20, in, violent, motion, as, soon, as, the, agent, stops, causing, it, the, motion, stops, also, in, other, words, the, natural, state, of, an, object, is, to, be, at, rest, since, aristotle, does, not, address, friction, with, this, understanding, it, can, be, observed, that, as, aristotle, stated, heavy, objects, on, the, ground, say, require, more, force, to, make, them, move, and, objects, pushed, with, greater, force, move, faster, this, would, imply, the, equation, incorrect, in, modern, physics, natural, motion, depends, on, the, element, concerned, the, aether, naturally, moves, in, a, circle, around, the, heavens, while, the, 4, empedoclean, elements, move, vertically, up, like, fire, as, is, observed, or, down, like, earth, towards, their, natural, resting, places, in, the, physics, 215a25, aristotle, effectively, states, a, quantitative, law, that, the, speed, v, of, a, falling, body, is, proportional, say, with, constant, c, to, its, weight, w, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, density, of, the, fluid, in, which, it, is, falling, aristotle, implies, that, in, a, vacuum, the, speed, of, fall, would, become, infinite, and, concludes, from, this, apparent, absurdity, that, a, vacuum, is, not, possible, opinions, have, varied, on, whether, aristotle, intended, to, state, quantitative, laws, henri, carteron, held, the, extreme, view, that, aristotle, s, concept, of, force, was, basically, qualitative, but, other, authors, reject, this, archimedes, corrected, aristotle, s, theory, that, bodies, move, towards, their, natural, resting, places, metal, boats, can, float, if, they, displace, enough, water, floating, depends, in, archimedes, scheme, on, the, mass, and, volume, of, the, object, not, as, aristotle, thought, its, elementary, composition, aristotle, s, writings, on, motion, remained, influential, until, the, early, modern, period, john, philoponus, in, late, antiquity, and, galileo, in, early, modern, period, are, said, to, have, shown, by, experiment, that, aristotle, s, claim, that, a, heavier, object, falls, faster, than, a, lighter, object, is, incorrect, a, contrary, opinion, is, given, by, carlo, rovelli, who, argues, that, aristotle, s, physics, of, motion, is, correct, within, its, domain, of, validity, that, of, objects, in, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, immersed, in, a, fluid, such, as, air, in, this, system, heavy, bodies, in, steady, fall, indeed, travel, faster, than, light, ones, whether, friction, is, ignored, or, not, and, they, do, fall, more, slowly, in, a, denser, medium, newton, s, forced, motion, corresponds, to, aristotle, s, violent, motion, with, its, external, agent, but, aristotle, s, assumption, that, the, agent, s, effect, stops, immediately, it, stops, acting, e, g, the, ball, leaves, the, thrower, s, hand, has, awkward, consequences, he, has, to, suppose, that, surrounding, fluid, helps, to, push, the, ball, along, to, make, it, continue, to, rise, even, though, the, hand, is, no, longer, acting, on, it, resulting, in, the, medieval, theory, of, impetus, aristotle, suggested, that, the, reason, for, anything, coming, about, can, be, attributed, to, four, different, types, of, simultaneously, active, factors, his, term, aitia, is, traditionally, translated, as, cause, but, it, does, not, always, refer, to, temporal, sequence, it, might, be, better, translated, as, explanation, but, the, traditional, rendering, will, be, employed, here, aristotle, describes, experiments, in, optics, using, a, camera, obscura, in, problems, book, 15, the, apparatus, consisted, of, a, dark, chamber, with, a, small, aperture, that, let, light, in, with, it, he, saw, that, whatever, shape, he, made, the, hole, the, sun, s, image, always, remained, circular, he, also, noted, that, increasing, the, distance, between, the, aperture, and, the, image, surface, magnified, the, image, according, to, aristotle, spontaneity, and, chance, are, causes, of, some, things, distinguishable, from, other, types, of, cause, such, as, simple, necessity, chance, as, an, incidental, cause, lies, in, the, realm, of, accidental, things, from, what, is, spontaneous, there, is, also, more, a, specific, kind, of, chance, which, aristotle, names, luck, that, only, applies, to, people, s, moral, choices, in, astronomy, aristotle, refuted, democritus, s, claim, that, the, milky, way, was, made, up, of, those, stars, which, are, shaded, by, the, earth, from, the, sun, s, rays, pointing, out, partly, correctly, that, if, the, size, of, the, sun, is, greater, than, that, of, the, earth, and, the, distance, of, the, stars, from, the, earth, many, times, greater, than, that, of, the, sun, then, the, sun, shines, on, all, the, stars, and, the, earth, screens, none, of, them, he, also, wrote, descriptions, of, comets, including, the, great, comet, of, 371, bc, aristotle, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, record, any, geological, observations, he, stated, that, geological, change, was, too, slow, to, be, observed, in, one, person, s, lifetime, the, geologist, charles, lyell, noted, that, aristotle, described, such, change, including, lakes, that, had, dried, up, and, deserts, that, had, become, watered, by, rivers, giving, as, examples, the, growth, of, the, nile, delta, since, the, time, of, homer, and, the, upheaving, of, one, of, the, aeolian, islands, previous, to, a, volcanic, eruption, meteorologica, lends, its, name, to, the, modern, study, of, meteorology, but, its, modern, usage, diverges, from, the, content, of, aristotle, s, ancient, treatise, on, meteors, the, ancient, greeks, did, use, the, term, for, a, range, of, atmospheric, phenomena, but, also, for, earthquakes, and, volcanic, eruptions, aristotle, proposed, that, the, cause, of, earthquakes, was, a, gas, or, vapor, anathymiaseis, that, was, trapped, inside, the, earth, and, trying, to, escape, following, other, greek, authors, anaxagoras, empedocles, and, democritus, aristotle, also, made, many, observations, about, the, hydrologic, cycle, for, example, he, made, some, of, the, earliest, observations, about, desalination, he, observed, early, and, correctly, that, when, seawater, is, heated, freshwater, evaporates, and, that, the, oceans, are, then, replenished, by, the, cycle, of, rainfall, and, river, runoff, i, have, proved, by, experiment, that, salt, water, evaporated, forms, fresh, and, the, vapor, does, not, when, it, condenses, condense, into, sea, water, again, aristotle, was, the, first, person, to, study, biology, systematically, and, biology, forms, a, large, part, of, his, writings, he, spent, two, years, observing, and, describing, the, zoology, of, lesbos, and, the, surrounding, seas, including, in, particular, the, pyrrha, lagoon, in, the, centre, of, lesbos, his, data, in, history, of, animals, generation, of, animals, movement, of, animals, and, parts, of, animals, are, assembled, from, his, own, observations, statements, given, by, people, with, specialized, knowledge, such, as, beekeepers, and, fishermen, and, less, accurate, accounts, provided, by, travellers, from, overseas, his, apparent, emphasis, on, animals, rather, than, plants, is, a, historical, accident, his, works, on, botany, have, been, lost, but, two, books, on, plants, by, his, pupil, theophrastus, have, survived, aristotle, reports, on, the, sea, life, visible, from, observation, on, lesbos, and, the, catches, of, fishermen, he, describes, the, catfish, electric, ray, and, frogfish, in, detail, as, well, as, cephalopods, such, as, the, octopus, and, paper, nautilus, his, description, of, the, hectocotyl, arm, of, cephalopods, used, in, sexual, reproduction, was, widely, disbelieved, until, the, 19th, century, he, gives, accurate, descriptions, of, the, four, chambered, fore, stomachs, of, ruminants, and, of, the, ovoviviparous, embryological, development, of, the, hound, shark, he, notes, that, an, animal, s, structure, is, well, matched, to, function, so, birds, like, the, heron, which, live, in, marshes, with, soft, mud, and, live, by, catching, fish, have, a, long, neck, long, legs, and, a, sharp, spear, like, beak, whereas, ducks, that, swim, have, short, legs, and, webbed, feet, darwin, too, noted, these, sorts, of, differences, between, similar, kinds, of, animal, but, unlike, aristotle, used, the, data, to, come, to, the, theory, of, evolution, aristotle, s, writings, can, seem, to, modern, readers, close, to, implying, evolution, but, while, aristotle, was, aware, that, new, mutations, or, hybridizations, could, occur, he, saw, these, as, rare, accidents, for, aristotle, accidents, like, heat, waves, in, winter, must, be, considered, distinct, from, natural, causes, he, was, thus, critical, of, empedocles, s, materialist, theory, of, a, survival, of, the, fittest, origin, of, living, things, and, their, organs, and, ridiculed, the, idea, that, accidents, could, lead, to, orderly, results, to, put, his, views, into, modern, terms, he, nowhere, says, that, different, species, can, have, a, common, ancestor, or, that, one, kind, can, change, into, another, or, that, kinds, can, become, extinct, aristotle, did, not, do, experiments, in, the, modern, sense, he, used, the, ancient, greek, term, pepeiramenoi, to, mean, observations, or, at, most, investigative, procedures, like, dissection, in, generation, of, animals, he, finds, a, fertilized, hen, s, egg, of, a, suitable, stage, and, opens, it, to, see, the, embryo, s, heart, beating, inside, instead, he, practiced, a, different, style, of, science, systematically, gathering, data, discovering, patterns, common, to, whole, groups, of, animals, and, inferring, possible, causal, explanations, from, these, this, style, is, common, in, modern, biology, when, large, amounts, of, data, become, available, in, a, new, field, such, as, genomics, it, does, not, result, in, the, same, certainty, as, experimental, science, but, it, sets, out, testable, hypotheses, and, constructs, a, narrative, explanation, of, what, is, observed, in, this, sense, aristotle, s, biology, is, scientific, from, the, data, he, collected, and, documented, aristotle, inferred, quite, a, number, of, rules, relating, the, life, history, features, of, the, live, bearing, tetrapods, terrestrial, placental, mammals, that, he, studied, among, these, correct, predictions, are, the, following, brood, size, decreases, with, adult, body, mass, so, that, an, elephant, has, fewer, young, usually, just, one, per, brood, than, a, mouse, lifespan, increases, with, gestation, period, and, also, with, body, mass, so, that, elephants, live, longer, than, mice, have, a, longer, period, of, gestation, and, are, heavier, as, a, final, example, fecundity, decreases, with, lifespan, so, long, lived, kinds, like, elephants, have, fewer, young, in, total, than, short, lived, kinds, like, mice, aristotle, distinguished, about, 500, species, of, animals, arranging, these, in, the, history, of, animals, in, a, graded, scale, of, perfection, a, nonreligious, version, of, the, scala, naturae, with, man, at, the, top, his, system, had, eleven, grades, of, animal, from, highest, potential, to, lowest, expressed, in, their, form, at, birth, the, highest, gave, live, birth, to, hot, and, wet, creatures, the, lowest, laid, cold, dry, mineral, like, eggs, animals, came, above, plants, and, these, in, turn, were, above, minerals, he, grouped, what, the, modern, zoologist, would, call, vertebrates, as, the, hotter, animals, with, blood, and, below, them, the, colder, invertebrates, as, animals, without, blood, those, with, blood, were, divided, into, the, live, bearing, mammals, and, the, egg, laying, birds, reptiles, fish, those, without, blood, were, insects, crustacea, non, shelled, cephalopods, and, shelled, and, the, hard, shelled, molluscs, bivalves, and, gastropods, he, recognised, that, animals, did, not, exactly, fit, into, a, linear, scale, and, noted, various, exceptions, such, as, that, sharks, had, a, placenta, like, the, tetrapods, to, a, modern, biologist, the, explanation, not, available, to, aristotle, is, convergent, evolution, philosophers, of, science, have, generally, concluded, that, aristotle, was, not, interested, in, taxonomy, but, zoologists, who, studied, this, question, in, the, early, 21st, century, think, otherwise, he, believed, that, purposive, final, causes, guided, all, natural, processes, this, teleological, view, justified, his, observed, data, as, an, expression, of, formal, design, aristotle, s, psychology, given, in, his, treatise, on, the, soul, peri, psych, s, posits, three, kinds, of, soul, psyches, the, vegetative, soul, the, sensitive, soul, and, the, rational, soul, humans, have, all, three, the, vegetative, soul, is, concerned, with, growth, and, nourishment, the, sensitive, soul, experiences, sensations, and, movement, the, unique, part, of, the, human, rational, soul, is, its, ability, to, receive, forms, of, other, things, and, to, compare, them, using, the, nous, intellect, and, logos, reason, for, aristotle, the, soul, is, the, form, of, a, living, being, because, all, beings, are, composites, of, form, and, matter, the, form, of, living, beings, is, that, which, endows, them, with, what, is, specific, to, living, beings, e, g, the, ability, to, initiate, movement, or, in, the, case, of, plants, growth, and, transformations, which, aristotle, considers, types, of, movement, in, contrast, to, earlier, philosophers, but, in, accordance, with, the, egyptians, he, placed, the, rational, soul, in, the, heart, rather, than, the, brain, notable, is, aristotle, s, division, of, sensation, and, thought, which, generally, differed, from, the, concepts, of, previous, philosophers, with, the, exception, of, alcmaeon, in, on, the, soul, aristotle, famously, criticizes, plato, s, theory, of, the, soul, and, develops, his, own, in, response, the, first, criticism, is, against, plato, s, view, of, the, soul, in, the, timaeus, that, the, soul, takes, up, space, and, is, able, to, come, into, physical, contact, with, bodies, 20th, century, scholarship, overwhelmingly, opposed, aristotle, s, interpretation, of, plato, and, maintained, that, he, had, misunderstood, him, today, s, scholars, have, tended, to, re, assess, aristotle, s, interpretation, and, been, more, positive, about, it, aristotle, s, other, criticism, is, that, plato, s, view, of, reincarnation, entails, that, it, is, possible, for, a, soul, and, its, body, to, be, mis, matched, in, principle, aristotle, alleges, any, soul, can, go, with, any, body, according, to, plato, s, theory, aristotle, s, claim, that, the, soul, is, the, form, of, a, living, being, eliminates, that, possibility, and, thus, rules, out, reincarnation, according, to, aristotle, in, on, the, soul, memory, is, the, ability, to, hold, a, perceived, experience, in, the, mind, and, to, distinguish, between, the, internal, appearance, and, an, occurrence, in, the, past, in, other, words, a, memory, is, a, mental, picture, phantasm, that, can, be, recovered, aristotle, believed, an, impression, is, left, on, a, semi, fluid, bodily, organ, that, undergoes, several, changes, in, order, to, make, a, memory, a, memory, occurs, when, stimuli, such, as, sights, or, sounds, are, so, complex, that, the, nervous, system, cannot, receive, all, the, impressions, at, once, these, changes, are, the, same, as, those, involved, in, the, operations, of, sensation, aristotelian, common, sense, and, thinking, aristotle, uses, the, term, memory, for, the, actual, retaining, of, an, experience, in, the, impression, that, can, develop, from, sensation, and, for, the, intellectual, anxiety, that, comes, with, the, impression, because, it, is, formed, at, a, particular, time, and, processing, specific, contents, memory, is, of, the, past, prediction, is, of, the, future, and, sensation, is, of, the, present, retrieval, of, impressions, cannot, be, performed, suddenly, a, transitional, channel, is, needed, and, located, in, past, experiences, both, for, previous, experience, and, present, experience, because, aristotle, believes, people, receive, all, kinds, of, sense, perceptions, and, perceive, them, as, impressions, people, are, continually, weaving, together, new, impressions, of, experiences, to, search, for, these, impressions, people, search, the, memory, itself, within, the, memory, if, one, experience, is, offered, instead, of, a, specific, memory, that, person, will, reject, this, experience, until, they, find, what, they, are, looking, for, recollection, occurs, when, one, retrieved, experience, naturally, follows, another, if, the, chain, of, images, is, needed, one, memory, will, stimulate, the, next, when, people, recall, experiences, they, stimulate, certain, previous, experiences, until, they, reach, the, one, that, is, needed, recollection, is, thus, the, self, directed, activity, of, retrieving, the, information, stored, in, a, memory, impression, only, humans, can, remember, impressions, of, intellectual, activity, such, as, numbers, and, words, animals, that, have, perception, of, time, can, retrieve, memories, of, their, past, observations, remembering, involves, only, perception, of, the, things, remembered, and, of, the, time, passed, aristotle, believed, the, chain, of, thought, which, ends, in, recollection, of, certain, impressions, was, connected, systematically, in, relationships, such, as, similarity, contrast, and, contiguity, described, in, his, laws, of, association, aristotle, believed, that, past, experiences, are, hidden, within, the, mind, a, force, operates, to, awaken, the, hidden, material, to, bring, up, the, actual, experience, according, to, aristotle, association, is, the, power, innate, in, a, mental, state, which, operates, upon, the, unexpressed, remains, of, former, experiences, allowing, them, to, rise, and, be, recalled, aristotle, describes, sleep, in, on, sleep, and, wakefulness, sleep, takes, place, as, a, result, of, overuse, of, the, senses, or, of, digestion, so, it, is, vital, to, the, body, while, a, person, is, asleep, the, critical, activities, which, include, thinking, sensing, recalling, and, remembering, do, not, function, as, they, do, during, wakefulness, since, a, person, cannot, sense, during, sleep, they, cannot, have, desire, which, is, the, result, of, sensation, however, the, senses, are, able, to, work, during, sleep, albeit, differently, unless, they, are, weary, dreams, do, not, involve, actually, sensing, a, stimulus, in, dreams, sensation, is, still, involved, but, in, an, altered, manner, aristotle, explains, that, when, a, person, stares, at, a, moving, stimulus, such, as, the, waves, in, a, body, of, water, and, then, looks, away, the, next, thing, they, look, at, appears, to, have, a, wavelike, motion, when, a, person, perceives, a, stimulus, and, the, stimulus, is, no, longer, the, focus, of, their, attention, it, leaves, an, impression, when, the, body, is, awake, and, the, senses, are, functioning, properly, a, person, constantly, encounters, new, stimuli, to, sense, and, so, the, impressions, of, previously, perceived, stimuli, are, ignored, however, during, sleep, the, impressions, made, throughout, the, day, are, noticed, as, there, are, no, new, distracting, sensory, experiences, so, dreams, result, from, these, lasting, impressions, since, impressions, are, all, that, are, left, and, not, the, exact, stimuli, dreams, do, not, resemble, the, actual, waking, experience, during, sleep, a, person, is, in, an, altered, state, of, mind, aristotle, compares, a, sleeping, person, to, a, person, who, is, overtaken, by, strong, feelings, toward, a, stimulus, for, example, a, person, who, has, a, strong, infatuation, with, someone, may, begin, to, think, they, see, that, person, everywhere, because, they, are, so, overtaken, by, their, feelings, since, a, person, sleeping, is, in, a, suggestible, state, and, unable, to, make, judgements, they, become, easily, deceived, by, what, appears, in, their, dreams, like, the, infatuated, person, this, leads, the, person, to, believe, the, dream, is, real, even, when, the, dreams, are, absurd, in, nature, in, de, anima, iii, 3, aristotle, ascribes, the, ability, to, create, to, store, and, to, recall, images, in, the, absence, of, perception, to, the, faculty, of, imagination, phantasia, one, component, of, aristotle, s, theory, of, dreams, disagrees, with, previously, held, beliefs, he, claimed, that, dreams, are, not, foretelling, and, not, sent, by, a, divine, being, aristotle, reasoned, naturalistically, that, instances, in, which, dreams, do, resemble, future, events, are, simply, coincidences, aristotle, claimed, that, a, dream, is, first, established, by, the, fact, that, the, person, is, asleep, when, they, experience, it, if, a, person, had, an, image, appear, for, a, moment, after, waking, up, or, if, they, see, something, in, the, dark, it, is, not, considered, a, dream, because, they, were, awake, when, it, occurred, secondly, any, sensory, experience, that, is, perceived, while, a, person, is, asleep, does, not, qualify, as, part, of, a, dream, for, example, if, while, a, person, is, sleeping, a, door, shuts, and, in, their, dream, they, hear, a, door, is, shut, this, sensory, experience, is, not, part, of, the, dream, lastly, the, images, of, dreams, must, be, a, result, of, lasting, impressions, of, waking, sensory, experiences, aristotle, s, practical, philosophy, covers, areas, such, as, ethics, politics, economics, and, rhetoric, aristotle, considered, ethics, to, be, a, practical, rather, than, theoretical, study, i, e, one, aimed, at, becoming, good, and, doing, good, rather, than, knowing, for, its, own, sake, he, wrote, several, treatises, on, ethics, most, notably, including, the, nicomachean, ethics, aristotle, taught, that, virtue, has, to, do, with, the, proper, function, ergon, of, a, thing, an, eye, is, only, a, good, eye, in, so, much, as, it, can, see, because, the, proper, function, of, an, eye, is, sight, aristotle, reasoned, that, humans, must, have, a, function, specific, to, humans, and, that, this, function, must, be, an, activity, of, the, psuch, soul, in, accordance, with, reason, logos, aristotle, identified, such, an, optimum, activity, the, virtuous, mean, between, the, accompanying, vices, of, excess, or, deficiency, of, the, soul, as, the, aim, of, all, human, deliberate, action, eudaimonia, generally, translated, as, happiness, or, sometimes, well, being, to, have, the, potential, of, ever, being, happy, in, this, way, necessarily, requires, a, good, character, thik, aret, often, translated, as, moral, or, ethical, virtue, or, excellence, aristotle, taught, that, to, achieve, a, virtuous, and, potentially, happy, character, requires, a, first, stage, of, having, the, fortune, to, be, habituated, not, deliberately, but, by, teachers, and, experience, leading, to, a, later, stage, in, which, one, consciously, chooses, to, do, the, best, things, when, the, best, people, come, to, live, life, this, way, their, practical, wisdom, phronesis, and, their, intellect, nous, can, develop, with, each, other, towards, the, highest, possible, human, virtue, the, wisdom, of, an, accomplished, theoretical, or, speculative, thinker, or, in, other, words, a, philosopher, in, addition, to, his, works, on, ethics, which, address, the, individual, aristotle, addressed, the, city, in, his, work, titled, politics, aristotle, considered, the, city, to, be, a, natural, community, moreover, he, considered, the, city, to, be, prior, in, importance, to, the, family, which, in, turn, is, prior, to, the, individual, for, the, whole, must, of, necessity, be, prior, to, the, part, he, famously, stated, that, man, is, by, nature, a, political, animal, and, argued, that, humanity, s, defining, factor, among, others, in, the, animal, kingdom, is, its, rationality, aristotle, conceived, of, politics, as, being, like, an, organism, rather, than, like, a, machine, and, as, a, collection, of, parts, none, of, which, can, exist, without, the, others, aristotle, s, conception, of, the, city, is, organic, and, he, is, considered, one, of, the, first, to, conceive, of, the, city, in, this, manner, the, common, modern, understanding, of, a, political, community, as, a, modern, state, is, quite, different, from, aristotle, s, understanding, although, he, was, aware, of, the, existence, and, potential, of, larger, empires, the, natural, community, according, to, aristotle, was, the, city, polis, which, functions, as, a, political, community, or, partnership, koin, nia, the, aim, of, the, city, is, not, just, to, avoid, injustice, or, for, economic, stability, but, rather, to, allow, at, least, some, citizens, the, possibility, to, live, a, good, life, and, to, perform, beautiful, acts, the, political, partnership, must, be, regarded, therefore, as, being, for, the, sake, of, noble, actions, not, for, the, sake, of, living, together, this, is, distinguished, from, modern, approaches, beginning, with, social, contract, theory, according, to, which, individuals, leave, the, state, of, nature, because, of, fear, of, violent, death, or, its, inconveniences, in, protrepticus, the, character, aristotle, states, for, we, all, agree, that, the, most, excellent, man, should, rule, i, e, the, supreme, by, nature, and, that, the, law, rules, and, alone, is, authoritative, but, the, law, is, a, kind, of, intelligence, i, e, a, discourse, based, on, intelligence, and, again, what, standard, do, we, have, what, criterion, of, good, things, that, is, more, precise, than, the, intelligent, man, for, all, that, this, man, will, choose, if, the, choice, is, based, on, his, knowledge, are, good, things, and, their, contraries, are, bad, and, since, everybody, chooses, most, of, all, what, conforms, to, their, own, proper, dispositions, a, just, man, choosing, to, live, justly, a, man, with, bravery, to, live, bravely, likewise, a, self, controlled, man, to, live, with, self, control, it, is, clear, that, the, intelligent, man, will, choose, most, of, all, to, be, intelligent, for, this, is, the, function, of, that, capacity, hence, it, s, evident, that, according, to, the, most, authoritative, judgment, intelligence, is, supreme, among, goods, as, plato, s, disciple, aristotle, was, rather, critical, concerning, democracy, and, following, the, outline, of, certain, ideas, from, plato, s, statesman, he, developed, a, coherent, theory, of, integrating, various, forms, of, power, into, a, so, called, mixed, state, it, is, constitutional, to, take, from, oligarchy, that, offices, are, to, be, elected, and, from, democracy, that, this, is, not, to, be, on, a, property, qualification, this, then, is, the, mode, of, the, mixture, and, the, mark, of, a, good, mixture, of, democracy, and, oligarchy, is, when, it, is, possible, to, speak, of, the, same, constitution, as, a, democracy, and, as, an, oligarchy, aristotle, made, substantial, contributions, to, economic, thought, especially, to, thought, in, the, middle, ages, in, politics, aristotle, addresses, the, city, property, and, trade, his, response, to, criticisms, of, private, property, in, lionel, robbins, s, view, anticipated, later, proponents, of, private, property, among, philosophers, and, economists, as, it, related, to, the, overall, utility, of, social, arrangements, aristotle, believed, that, although, communal, arrangements, may, seem, beneficial, to, society, and, that, although, private, property, is, often, blamed, for, social, strife, such, evils, in, fact, come, from, human, nature, in, politics, aristotle, offers, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, of, the, origin, of, money, money, came, into, use, because, people, became, dependent, on, one, another, importing, what, they, needed, and, exporting, the, surplus, for, the, sake, of, convenience, people, then, agreed, to, deal, in, something, that, is, intrinsically, useful, and, easily, applicable, such, as, iron, or, silver, aristotle, s, discussions, on, retail, and, interest, was, a, major, influence, on, economic, thought, in, the, middle, ages, he, had, a, low, opinion, of, retail, believing, that, contrary, to, using, money, to, procure, things, one, needs, in, managing, the, household, retail, trade, seeks, to, make, a, profit, it, thus, uses, goods, as, a, means, to, an, end, rather, than, as, an, end, unto, itself, he, believed, that, retail, trade, was, in, this, way, unnatural, similarly, aristotle, considered, making, a, profit, through, interest, unnatural, as, it, makes, a, gain, out, of, the, money, itself, and, not, from, its, use, aristotle, gave, a, summary, of, the, function, of, money, that, was, perhaps, remarkably, precocious, for, his, time, he, wrote, that, because, it, is, impossible, to, determine, the, value, of, every, good, through, a, count, of, the, number, of, other, goods, it, is, worth, the, necessity, arises, of, a, single, universal, standard, of, measurement, money, thus, allows, for, the, association, of, different, goods, and, makes, them, commensurable, he, goes, on, to, state, that, money, is, also, useful, for, future, exchange, making, it, a, sort, of, security, that, is, if, we, do, not, want, a, thing, now, we, shall, be, able, to, get, it, when, we, do, want, it, aristotle, s, rhetoric, proposes, that, a, speaker, can, use, three, basic, kinds, of, appeals, to, persuade, his, audience, ethos, an, appeal, to, the, speaker, s, character, pathos, an, appeal, to, the, audience, s, emotion, and, logos, an, appeal, to, logical, reasoning, he, also, categorizes, rhetoric, into, three, genres, epideictic, ceremonial, speeches, dealing, with, praise, or, blame, forensic, judicial, speeches, over, guilt, or, innocence, and, deliberative, speeches, calling, on, an, audience, to, make, a, decision, on, an, issue, aristotle, also, outlines, two, kinds, of, rhetorical, proofs, enthymeme, proof, by, syllogism, and, paradeigma, proof, by, example, aristotle, writes, in, his, poetics, that, epic, poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic, poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and, dance, are, all, fundamentally, acts, of, mimesis, imitation, each, varying, in, imitation, by, medium, object, and, manner, he, applies, the, term, mimesis, both, as, a, property, of, a, work, of, art, and, also, as, the, product, of, the, artist, s, intention, and, contends, that, the, audience, s, realisation, of, the, mimesis, is, vital, to, understanding, the, work, itself, aristotle, states, that, mimesis, is, a, natural, instinct, of, humanity, that, separates, humans, from, animals, and, that, all, human, artistry, follows, the, pattern, of, nature, because, of, this, aristotle, believed, that, each, of, the, mimetic, arts, possesses, what, stephen, halliwell, calls, highly, structured, procedures, for, the, achievement, of, their, purposes, for, example, music, imitates, with, the, media, of, rhythm, and, harmony, whereas, dance, imitates, with, rhythm, alone, and, poetry, with, language, the, forms, also, differ, in, their, object, of, imitation, comedy, for, instance, is, a, dramatic, imitation, of, men, worse, than, average, whereas, tragedy, imitates, men, slightly, better, than, average, lastly, the, forms, differ, in, their, manner, of, imitation, through, narrative, or, character, through, change, or, no, change, and, through, drama, or, no, drama, while, it, is, believed, that, aristotle, s, poetics, originally, comprised, two, books, one, on, comedy, and, one, on, tragedy, only, the, portion, that, focuses, on, tragedy, has, survived, aristotle, taught, that, tragedy, is, composed, of, six, elements, plot, structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and, lyric, poetry, the, characters, in, a, tragedy, are, merely, a, means, of, driving, the, story, and, the, plot, not, the, characters, is, the, chief, focus, of, tragedy, tragedy, is, the, imitation, of, action, arousing, pity, and, fear, and, is, meant, to, effect, the, catharsis, of, those, same, emotions, aristotle, concludes, poetics, with, a, discussion, on, which, if, either, is, superior, epic, or, tragic, mimesis, he, suggests, that, because, tragedy, possesses, all, the, attributes, of, an, epic, possibly, possesses, additional, attributes, such, as, spectacle, and, music, is, more, unified, and, achieves, the, aim, of, its, mimesis, in, shorter, scope, it, can, be, considered, superior, to, epic, aristotle, was, a, keen, systematic, collector, of, riddles, folklore, and, proverbs, he, and, his, school, had, a, special, interest, in, the, riddles, of, the, delphic, oracle, and, studied, the, fables, of, aesop, aristotle, asserted, that, men, were, superior, to, women, writing, the, male, is, by, nature, superior, and, the, female, inferior, the, male, ruler, and, the, female, subject, on, this, ground, proponents, of, feminist, metaphysics, have, accused, aristotle, of, misogyny, and, sexism, however, aristotle, gave, equal, weight, to, women, s, happiness, as, he, did, to, men, s, and, commented, in, his, rhetoric, that, the, things, that, lead, to, happiness, need, to, be, in, women, as, well, as, men, aristotle, like, other, greek, philosophers, such, plato, and, xenophon, rejected, the, homosexuality, believing, that, it, could, lead, people, to, become, immoral, due, to, the, fact, that, he, believed, it, went, against, nature, s, purpose, more, than, 2300, years, after, his, death, aristotle, remains, one, of, the, most, influential, people, who, ever, lived, he, contributed, to, almost, every, field, of, human, knowledge, then, in, existence, and, he, was, the, founder, of, many, new, fields, according, to, the, philosopher, bryan, magee, it, is, doubtful, whether, any, human, being, has, ever, known, as, much, as, he, did, among, countless, other, achievements, aristotle, was, the, founder, of, formal, logic, pioneered, the, study, of, zoology, and, left, every, future, scientist, and, philosopher, in, his, debt, through, his, contributions, to, the, scientific, method, taneli, kukkonen, observes, that, his, achievement, in, founding, two, sciences, is, unmatched, and, his, reach, in, influencing, every, branch, of, intellectual, enterprise, including, western, ethical, and, political, theory, theology, rhetoric, and, literary, analysis, is, equally, long, as, a, result, kukkonen, argues, any, analysis, of, reality, today, will, almost, certainly, carry, aristotelian, overtones, evidence, of, an, exceptionally, forceful, mind, jonathan, barnes, wrote, that, an, account, of, aristotle, s, intellectual, afterlife, would, be, little, less, than, a, history, of, european, thought, aristotle, has, been, called, the, father, of, logic, biology, political, science, zoology, embryology, natural, law, scientific, method, rhetoric, psychology, realism, criticism, individualism, teleology, and, meteorology, the, scholar, taneli, kukkonen, notes, that, in, the, best, 20th, century, scholarship, aristotle, comes, alive, as, a, thinker, wrestling, with, the, full, weight, of, the, greek, philosophical, tradition, what, follows, is, an, overview, of, the, transmission, and, influence, of, his, texts, and, ideas, into, the, modern, era, aristotle, s, pupil, and, successor, theophrastus, wrote, the, history, of, plants, a, pioneering, work, in, botany, some, of, his, technical, terms, remain, in, use, such, as, carpel, from, carpos, fruit, and, pericarp, from, pericarpion, seed, chamber, theophrastus, was, much, less, concerned, with, formal, causes, than, aristotle, was, instead, pragmatically, describing, how, plants, functioned, the, immediate, influence, of, aristotle, s, work, was, felt, as, the, lyceum, grew, into, the, peripatetic, school, aristotle, s, students, included, aristoxenus, dicaearchus, demetrius, of, phalerum, eudemos, of, rhodes, harpalus, hephaestion, mnason, of, phocis, nicomachus, and, theophrastus, aristotle, s, influence, over, alexander, the, great, is, seen, in, the, latter, s, bringing, with, him, on, his, expedition, a, host, of, zoologists, botanists, and, researchers, he, had, also, learned, a, great, deal, about, persian, customs, and, traditions, from, his, teacher, although, his, respect, for, aristotle, was, diminished, as, his, travels, made, it, clear, that, much, of, aristotle, s, geography, was, clearly, wrong, when, the, old, philosopher, released, his, works, to, the, public, alexander, complained, thou, hast, not, done, well, to, publish, thy, acroamatic, doctrines, for, in, what, shall, i, surpass, other, men, if, those, doctrines, wherein, i, have, been, trained, are, to, be, all, men, s, common, property, after, theophrastus, the, lyceum, failed, to, produce, any, original, work, though, interest, in, aristotle, s, ideas, survived, they, were, generally, taken, unquestioningly, it, is, not, until, the, age, of, alexandria, under, the, ptolemies, that, advances, in, biology, can, be, again, found, the, first, medical, teacher, at, alexandria, herophilus, of, chalcedon, corrected, aristotle, placing, intelligence, in, the, brain, and, connected, the, nervous, system, to, motion, and, sensation, herophilus, also, distinguished, between, veins, and, arteries, noting, that, the, latter, pulse, while, the, former, do, not, though, a, few, ancient, atomists, such, as, lucretius, challenged, the, teleological, viewpoint, of, aristotelian, ideas, about, life, teleology, and, after, the, rise, of, christianity, natural, theology, would, remain, central, to, biological, thought, essentially, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, ernst, mayr, states, that, there, was, nothing, of, any, real, consequence, in, biology, after, lucretius, and, galen, until, the, renaissance, following, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, aristotle, s, vast, philosophical, and, scientific, corpus, lay, largely, dormant, in, the, west, however, his, works, underwent, a, remarkable, revival, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, translated, into, arabic, alongside, other, greek, classics, aristotle, s, logic, ethics, and, natural, philosophy, ignited, the, minds, of, early, islamic, scholars, through, meticulous, commentaries, and, critical, engagements, figures, like, al, farabi, and, ibn, sina, avicenna, breathed, new, life, into, aristotle, s, ideas, they, harmonized, his, logic, with, islamic, theology, employed, his, scientific, methodologies, to, explore, the, natural, world, and, even, reinterpreted, his, ethics, within, the, framework, of, islamic, morality, this, revival, was, not, mere, imitation, islamic, thinkers, embraced, aristotle, s, rigorous, methods, while, simultaneously, challenging, his, conclusions, where, they, diverged, from, their, own, religious, beliefs, greek, christian, scribes, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, preservation, of, aristotle, by, copying, all, the, extant, greek, language, manuscripts, of, the, corpus, the, first, greek, christians, to, comment, extensively, on, aristotle, were, philoponus, elias, and, david, in, the, sixth, century, and, stephen, of, alexandria, in, the, early, seventh, century, john, philoponus, stands, out, for, having, attempted, a, fundamental, critique, of, aristotle, s, views, on, the, eternity, of, the, world, movement, and, other, elements, of, aristotelian, thought, philoponus, questioned, aristotle, s, teaching, of, physics, noting, its, flaws, and, introducing, the, theory, of, impetus, to, explain, his, observations, after, a, hiatus, of, several, centuries, formal, commentary, by, eustratius, and, michael, of, ephesus, reappeared, in, the, late, eleventh, and, early, twelfth, centuries, apparently, sponsored, by, anna, comnena, aristotle, was, one, of, the, most, revered, thinkers, in, early, islamic, theology, most, of, the, still, extant, works, of, aristotle, as, well, as, a, number, of, the, original, greek, commentaries, were, translated, into, arabic, and, studied, by, muslim, philosophers, scientists, and, scholars, averroes, avicenna, and, alpharabius, who, wrote, on, aristotle, in, great, depth, also, influenced, thomas, aquinas, and, other, western, christian, scholastic, philosophers, alkindus, greatly, admired, aristotle, s, philosophy, and, averroes, spoke, of, aristotle, as, the, exemplar, for, all, future, philosophers, medieval, muslim, scholars, regularly, described, aristotle, as, the, first, teacher, the, title, was, later, used, by, western, philosophers, as, in, the, famous, poem, of, dante, who, were, influenced, by, the, tradition, of, islamic, philosophy, with, the, loss, of, the, study, of, ancient, greek, in, the, early, medieval, latin, west, aristotle, was, practically, unknown, there, from, c, ce, 600, to, c, 1100, except, through, the, latin, translation, of, the, organon, made, by, boethius, in, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, centuries, interest, in, aristotle, revived, and, latin, christians, had, translations, made, both, from, arabic, translations, such, as, those, by, gerard, of, cremona, and, from, the, original, greek, such, as, those, by, james, of, venice, and, william, of, moerbeke, after, the, scholastic, thomas, aquinas, wrote, his, summa, theologica, working, from, moerbeke, s, translations, and, calling, aristotle, the, philosopher, the, demand, for, aristotle, s, writings, grew, and, the, greek, manuscripts, returned, to, the, west, stimulating, a, revival, of, aristotelianism, in, europe, that, continued, into, the, renaissance, these, thinkers, blended, aristotelian, philosophy, with, christianity, bringing, the, thought, of, ancient, greece, into, the, middle, ages, scholars, such, as, boethius, peter, abelard, and, john, buridan, worked, on, aristotelian, logic, according, to, scholar, roger, theodore, lafferty, dante, built, up, the, philosophy, of, the, comedy, with, the, works, of, aristotle, as, a, foundation, just, as, the, scholastics, used, aristotle, as, the, basis, for, their, thinking, dante, knew, aristotle, directly, from, latin, translations, of, his, works, and, indirectly, through, quotations, in, the, works, of, albert, magnus, dante, even, acknowledges, aristotle, s, influence, explicitly, in, the, poem, specifically, when, virgil, justifies, the, inferno, s, structure, by, citing, the, nicomachean, ethics, dante, famously, refers, to, him, as, he, who, is, acknowledged, master, of, those, who, know, moses, maimonides, considered, to, be, the, foremost, intellectual, figure, of, medieval, judaism, adopted, aristotelianism, from, the, islamic, scholars, and, based, his, guide, for, the, perplexed, on, it, and, that, became, the, basis, of, jewish, scholastic, philosophy, maimonides, also, considered, aristotle, to, be, the, greatest, philosopher, that, ever, lived, and, styled, him, as, the, chief, of, the, philosophers, also, in, his, letter, to, samuel, ibn, tibbon, maimonides, observes, that, there, is, no, need, for, samuel, to, study, the, writings, of, philosophers, who, preceded, aristotle, because, the, works, of, the, latter, are, sufficient, by, themselves, and, to, all, that, were, written, before, them, his, intellect, aristotle, s, is, the, extreme, limit, of, human, intellect, apart, from, him, upon, whom, the, divine, emanation, has, flowed, forth, to, such, an, extent, that, they, reach, the, level, of, prophecy, there, being, no, level, higher, in, the, early, modern, period, scientists, such, as, william, harvey, in, england, and, galileo, galilei, in, italy, reacted, against, the, theories, of, aristotle, and, other, classical, era, thinkers, like, galen, establishing, new, theories, based, to, some, degree, on, observation, and, experiment, harvey, demonstrated, the, circulation, of, the, blood, establishing, that, the, heart, functioned, as, a, pump, rather, than, being, the, seat, of, the, soul, and, the, controller, of, the, body, s, heat, as, aristotle, thought, galileo, used, more, doubtful, arguments, to, displace, aristotle, s, physics, proposing, that, bodies, all, fall, at, the, same, speed, whatever, their, weight, the, english, mathematician, george, boole, fully, accepted, aristotle, s, logic, but, decided, to, go, under, over, and, beyond, it, with, his, system, of, algebraic, logic, in, his, 1854, book, the, laws, of, thought, this, gives, logic, a, mathematical, foundation, with, equations, enables, it, to, solve, equations, as, well, as, check, validity, and, allows, it, to, handle, a, wider, class, of, problems, by, expanding, propositions, of, any, number, of, terms, not, just, two, charles, darwin, regarded, aristotle, as, the, most, important, contributor, to, the, subject, of, biology, in, an, 1882, letter, he, wrote, that, linnaeus, and, cuvier, have, been, my, two, gods, though, in, very, different, ways, but, they, were, mere, schoolboys, to, old, aristotle, also, in, later, editions, of, the, book, on, the, origin, of, species, darwin, traced, evolutionary, ideas, as, far, back, as, aristotle, the, text, he, cites, is, a, summary, by, aristotle, of, the, ideas, of, the, earlier, greek, philosopher, empedocles, the, philosopher, bertrand, russell, claims, that, almost, every, serious, intellectual, advance, has, had, to, begin, with, an, attack, on, some, aristotelian, doctrine, russell, calls, aristotle, s, ethics, repulsive, and, labelled, his, logic, as, definitely, antiquated, as, ptolemaic, astronomy, russell, states, that, these, errors, make, it, difficult, to, do, historical, justice, to, aristotle, until, one, remembers, what, an, advance, he, made, upon, all, of, his, predecessors, the, dutch, historian, of, science, eduard, jan, dijksterhuis, writes, that, aristotle, and, his, predecessors, showed, the, difficulty, of, science, by, proceed, so, readily, to, frame, a, theory, of, such, a, general, character, on, limited, evidence, from, their, senses, in, 1985, the, biologist, peter, medawar, could, still, state, in, pure, seventeenth, century, tones, that, aristotle, had, assembled, a, strange, and, generally, speaking, rather, tiresome, farrago, of, hearsay, imperfect, observation, wishful, thinking, and, credulity, amounting, to, downright, gullibility, zoologists, have, frequently, mocked, aristotle, for, errors, and, unverified, secondhand, reports, however, modern, observation, has, confirmed, several, of, his, more, surprising, claims, aristotle, s, work, remains, largely, unknown, to, modern, scientists, though, zoologists, sometimes, mention, him, as, the, father, of, biology, or, in, particular, of, marine, biology, practising, zoologists, are, unlikely, to, adhere, to, aristotle, s, chain, of, being, but, its, influence, is, still, perceptible, in, the, use, of, the, terms, lower, and, upper, to, designate, taxa, such, as, groups, of, plants, the, evolutionary, biologist, armand, marie, leroi, has, reconstructed, aristotle, s, biology, while, niko, tinbergen, s, four, questions, based, on, aristotle, s, four, causes, are, used, to, analyse, animal, behaviour, they, examine, function, phylogeny, mechanism, and, ontogeny, the, concept, of, homology, began, with, aristotle, the, evolutionary, developmental, biologist, lewis, i, held, commented, that, he, would, be, interested, in, the, concept, of, deep, homology, the, works, of, aristotle, that, have, survived, from, antiquity, through, medieval, manuscript, transmission, are, collected, in, the, corpus, aristotelicum, these, texts, as, opposed, to, aristotle, s, lost, works, are, technical, philosophical, treatises, from, within, aristotle, s, school, reference, to, them, is, made, according, to, the, organization, of, immanuel, bekker, s, royal, prussian, academy, edition, aristotelis, opera, edidit, academia, regia, borussica, berlin, 1831, 1870, which, in, turn, is, based, on, ancient, classifications, of, these, works, aristotle, wrote, his, works, on, papyrus, scrolls, the, common, writing, medium, of, that, era, his, writings, are, divisible, into, two, groups, the, exoteric, intended, for, the, public, and, the, esoteric, for, use, within, the, lyceum, school, aristotle, s, lost, works, stray, considerably, in, characterization, from, the, surviving, aristotelian, corpus, whereas, the, lost, works, appear, to, have, been, originally, written, with, a, view, to, subsequent, publication, the, surviving, works, mostly, resemble, lecture, notes, not, intended, for, publication, cicero, s, description, of, aristotle, s, literary, style, as, a, river, of, gold, must, have, applied, to, the, published, works, not, the, surviving, notes, a, major, question, in, the, history, of, aristotle, s, works, is, how, the, exoteric, writings, were, all, lost, and, how, the, ones, now, possessed, came, to, be, found, the, consensus, is, that, andronicus, of, rhodes, collected, the, esoteric, works, of, aristotle, s, school, which, existed, in, the, form, of, smaller, separate, works, distinguished, them, from, those, of, theophrastus, and, other, peripatetics, edited, them, and, finally, compiled, them, into, the, more, cohesive, larger, works, as, they, are, known, today, according, to, strabo, and, plutarch, after, aristotle, s, death, his, library, and, writings, went, to, theophrastus, aristotle, s, successor, as, head, of, the, lycaeum, and, the, peripatetic, school, after, the, death, of, theophrastus, the, peripatetic, library, went, to, neleus, of, scepsis, 5, some, time, later, the, kingdom, of, pergamon, began, conscripting, books, for, a, royal, library, and, the, heirs, of, neleus, hid, their, collection, in, a, cellar, to, prevent, it, from, being, seized, for, that, purpose, the, library, was, stored, there, for, about, a, century, and, a, half, in, conditions, that, were, not, ideal, for, document, preservation, on, the, death, of, attalus, iii, which, also, ended, the, royal, library, ambitions, the, existence, of, aristotelian, library, was, disclosed, and, it, was, purchased, by, apellicon, and, returned, to, athens, in, about, 100, bc, 5, 6, apellicon, sought, to, recover, the, texts, many, of, which, were, seriously, degraded, at, this, point, due, to, the, conditions, in, which, they, were, stored, he, had, them, copied, out, into, new, manuscripts, and, used, his, best, guesswork, to, fill, in, the, gaps, where, the, originals, were, unreadable, 5, 6, when, sulla, seized, athens, in, 86, bc, he, seized, the, library, and, transferred, it, to, rome, there, andronicus, of, rhodes, organized, the, texts, into, the, first, complete, edition, of, aristotle, s, works, and, works, attributed, to, him, the, aristotelian, texts, we, have, today, are, based, on, these, 6, 8, aristotle, has, been, depicted, by, major, artists, including, lucas, cranach, the, elder, justus, van, gent, raphael, paolo, veronese, jusepe, de, ribera, rembrandt, and, francesco, hayez, over, the, centuries, among, the, best, known, depictions, is, raphael, s, fresco, the, school, of, athens, in, the, vatican, s, apostolic, palace, where, the, figures, of, plato, and, aristotle, are, central, to, the, image, at, the, architectural, vanishing, point, reflecting, their, importance, rembrandt, s, aristotle, with, a, bust, of, homer, too, is, a, celebrated, work, showing, the, knowing, philosopher, and, the, blind, homer, from, an, earlier, age, as, the, art, critic, jonathan, jones, writes, this, painting, will, remain, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, mysterious, in, the, world, ensnaring, us, in, its, musty, glowing, pitch, black, terrible, knowledge, of, time, the, aristotle, mountains, in, antarctica, are, named, after, aristotle, he, was, the, first, person, known, to, conjecture, in, his, book, meteorology, the, existence, of, a, landmass, in, the, southern, high, latitude, region, which, he, called, antarctica, aristoteles, is, a, crater, on, the, moon, bearing, the, classical, form, of, aristotle, s, name, 6123, aristoteles, an, asteroid, in, the, main, asteroid, belt, is, also, bearing, the, classical, form, of, his, name, the, secondary, literature, on, aristotle, is, vast, the, following, is, only, a, small, selection
