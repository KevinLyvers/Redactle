were, given, pieces, of, white, silk, for, them, to, hang, themselves, with, in, addition, cixi, refused, outright, the, idea, of, executing, the, family, members, of, the, regents, as, would, be, done, in, accordance, with, imperial, tradition, of, an, alleged, usurper, ironically, qing, imperial, tradition, also, dictated, that, women, and, princes, were, never, to, engage, in, politics, in,

weng, xincun, and, woren, this, group, was, later, joined, by, weng, xincun, s, son, weng, tonghe, the, emperor, s, governor, also, selected, by, cixi, was, mianyu, the, imperial, teachers, instructed, the, emperor, in, the, classics, and, various, old, texts, for, which, tongzhi, displayed, little, or, no, interest, despite, or, perhaps, because, of, the, pressure, and, stress, put, upon, the, young, emperor, he, despised, learning, for, the, majority, of, his, life, according, to, weng, tonghe, s, diary, tongzhi, could, not, read, a, memorandum, in, full, sentences, by, the, age, of, 16, worried, about, her, son, s, inability, to, learn, cixi, only, pressured, him, more, when, he, was, given, personal, rule, in, november, 1873, at, the, age, of, 18, four, years, behind, the, usual, custom, tongzhi, proved, to, be, an, incompetent, ruler, tongzhi, made, two, important, policy, decisions, during, his, short, stint, of, rule, which, lasted, from, 1873, to, 1875, first, he, decreed, that, the, summer, palace, destroyed, by, the, english, and, french, in, the, second, opium, war, would, be, completely, rebuilt, under, the, pretext, that, it, was, a, gift, to, cixi, and, ci, an, historians, also, suggest, that, it, was, an, attempt, to, drive, cixi, from, the, forbidden, city, so, that, he, could, rule, without, interference, in, policy, or, his, private, affairs, the, imperial, treasury, was, almost, depleted, at, the, time, from, internal, strife, and, foreign, wars, and, as, a, result, tongzhi, asked, the, board, of, finance, to, forage, for, the, necessary, funds, in, addition, he, encouraged, members, of, the, nobility, and, high, officials, to, donate, funds, from, their, personal, resources, once, construction, began, the, emperor, checked, its, progress, on, a, monthly, basis, and, would, often, spend, days, away, from, court, indulging, himself, in, pleasures, outside, of, the, forbidden, city, uneasy, about, tongzhi, s, neglect, of, national, affairs, the, emperor, s, uncles, prince, gong, and, prince, chun, along, with, other, senior, court, officials, submitted, a, joint, memorandum, asking, the, emperor, to, cease, the, construction, of, the, summer, palace, among, other, recommendations, tongzhi, unwilling, to, submit, to, criticism, issued, an, imperial, edict, in, august, 1874, to, strip, prince, gong, of, his, princely, title, and, demote, him, to, the, status, of, a, commoner, two, days, later, prince, dun, prince, chun, prince, fu, jingshou, prince, qing, wenxiang, baojun, and, grand, councillors, shen, guifen, and, li, hongzao, were, all, to, be, stripped, of, their, respective, titles, and, jobs, seeing, the, mayhem, unfold, from, behind, the, scenes, cixi, and, ci, an, made, an, unprecedented, appearance, at, court, directly, criticising, tongzhi, for, his, wrongful, actions, and, asked, him, to, withdraw, the, edict, cixi, said, that, without, prince, gong, the, situation, today, would, not, exist, for, you, and, me, feeling, a, grand, sense, of, loss, at, court, and, unable, to, assert, his, authority, tongzhi, returned, to, his, former, habits, it, was, rumoured, that, he, caught, syphilis, and, became, visibly, ill, the, physicians, spread, a, rumour, that, tongzhi, had, smallpox, and, proceeded, to, give, medical, treatment, accordingly, within, a, few, weeks, on, 13, january, 1875, tongzhi, died, his, wife, followed, suit, in, march, judging, from, a, modern, medical, perspective, the, onset, of, syphilis, comes, in, stages, thus, the, emperor, s, quick, death, does, not, seem, to, reflect, its, symptoms, therefore, most, historians, maintain, that, tongzhi, did, in, fact, die, from, smallpox, regardless, by, 1875, cixi, was, back, onto, the, helm, of, imperial, power, tongzhi, died, without, a, male, heir, a, circumstance, that, created, an, unprecedented, succession, crisis, in, the, dynastic, line, members, of, the, generation, above, were, considered, unfit, as, they, could, not, by, definition, be, the, successor, of, their, nephew, therefore, the, new, emperor, had, to, be, from, a, generation, below, or, the, same, generation, as, the, tongzhi, after, considerable, disagreement, between, the, two, empresses, dowager, zaitian, the, four, year, old, firstborn, son, of, prince, chun, and, cixi, s, sister, was, to, become, the, new, emperor, 1875, was, declared, the, first, year, of, the, guangxu, era, guangxu, was, the, new, emperor, s, regnal, name, and, it, means, glorious, succession, zaitian, was, taken, from, home, and, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, would, be, cut, completely, off, from, his, family, while, addressing, ci, an, conventionally, as, huang, e, niang, empress, mother, the, guangxu, emperor, was, forced, to, address, cixi, as, qin, baba, dear, father, in, order, to, enforce, an, image, that, she, was, the, fatherly, figure, in, the, household, guangxu, began, his, education, when, he, was, aged, five, taught, by, the, imperial, tutor, weng, tonghe, with, whom, he, would, develop, a, lasting, bond, shortly, after, guangxu, s, accession, cixi, fell, severely, ill, this, rendered, her, largely, inaccessible, to, her, young, nephew, and, had, the, result, of, leaving, ci, an, to, attend, to, most, of, the, affairs, of, state, the, sudden, death, of, ci, an, in, april, 1881, brought, cixi, a, new, challenge, ci, an, had, taken, little, interest, in, running, state, affairs, but, was, the, decision, maker, in, most, family, affairs, as, the, empress, of, the, xianfeng, emperor, she, took, seniority, over, cixi, despite, being, two, years, her, junior, some, believe, that, rumours, began, circulating, at, court, to, the, effect, that, cixi, had, poisoned, ci, an, perhaps, as, a, result, of, a, possible, conflict, between, cixi, and, ci, an, over, the, execution, of, the, eunuch, an, dehai, in, 1869, or, a, possible, will, from, the, late, xianfeng, emperor, that, was, issued, exclusively, to, ci, an, because, of, a, lack, of, evidence, however, historians, are, reluctant, to, believe, that, cixi, poisoned, ci, an, but, instead, choose, to, believe, that, the, cause, of, death, was, a, sudden, stroke, as, validated, by, traditional, chinese, medicine, in, the, years, between, 1881, and, 1883, cixi, resorted, to, written, communication, only, with, her, ministers, the, young, emperor, reportedly, was, forced, to, conduct, some, audiences, alone, without, cixi, to, assist, him, the, once, fierce, and, determined, prince, gong, frustrated, by, cixi, s, iron, grip, on, power, did, little, to, question, cixi, on, state, affairs, and, supported, manchu, involvement, in, the, sino, french, war, of, 1884, 1885, cixi, used, china, s, loss, in, the, war, as, a, pretext, for, getting, rid, of, prince, gong, and, other, important, decision, makers, in, the, grand, council, in, 1885, she, downgraded, prince, gong, to, advisor, and, elevated, the, more, easily, influenced, prince, chun, guangxu, s, father, when, it, was, first, developed, by, empress, dowager, cixi, the, beiyang, fleet, was, said, to, be, the, strongest, navy, in, east, asia, before, her, nephew, guangxu, took, over, the, throne, in, 1889, cixi, wrote, out, explicit, orders, that, the, navy, should, continue, to, develop, and, expand, gradually, however, after, cixi, went, into, retirement, all, naval, and, military, development, came, to, a, drastic, halt, japan, s, victories, over, china, has, often, been, falsely, rumored, to, be, the, fault, of, cixi, many, believed, that, cixi, was, the, cause, of, the, navy, s, defeat, by, embezzling, funds, from, the, navy, in, order, to, build, the, summer, palace, in, beijing, the, greatest, symbol, of, this, enduring, belief, is, the, marble, boat, that, is, part, of, the, summer, palace, however, extensive, research, by, chinese, historians, suggests, that, cixi, was, not, the, cause, of, the, chinese, navy, s, decline, in, actuality, china, s, defeat, was, caused, by, guangxu, s, lack, of, interest, in, developing, and, maintaining, the, military, his, close, adviser, grand, tutor, weng, tonghe, advised, guangxu, to, cut, all, funding, to, the, navy, and, army, because, he, did, not, see, japan, as, a, true, threat, and, there, were, several, natural, disasters, during, the, early, 1890s, which, the, emperor, thought, to, be, more, pressing, to, expend, funds, on, guangxu, technically, gained, the, right, to, rule, at, the, age, of, 16, in, 1887, after, cixi, issued, an, edict, to, arrange, a, ceremony, to, mark, his, accession, because, of, her, prestige, and, power, however, court, officials, voiced, their, opposition, to, guangxu, s, personal, rule, citing, the, emperor, s, youth, as, the, main, reason, prince, chun, and, weng, tonghe, each, with, a, different, motive, requested, that, guangxu, s, accession, be, postponed, until, a, later, date, cixi, with, her, reputed, reluctance, accepted, the, advice, and, legitimised, her, continued, rule, through, a, new, legal, document, that, allowed, her, to, aid, guangxu, in, his, rule, indefinitely, guangxu, slowly, began, to, take, on, more, responsibilities, in, spite, of, cixi, s, prolonged, regency, in, 1886, he, attended, his, first, field, plowing, ceremony, and, began, commenting, on, imperial, state, documents, by, 1887, he, began, to, rule, under, cixi, s, supervision, guangxu, married, and, took, up, the, reins, of, power, in, 1889, by, that, year, the, emperor, was, already, 18, older, than, the, conventional, marriage, age, for, emperors, prior, to, his, wedding, a, large, fire, engulfed, the, gate, of, supreme, harmony, at, the, forbidden, city, this, event, followed, a, trend, of, recent, natural, disasters, that, were, considered, alarming, by, many, observers, according, to, traditional, chinese, political, theory, such, incidents, were, taken, as, a, warning, of, the, imminent, loss, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, by, current, rulers, for, guangxu, s, empress, cixi, chose, her, niece, and, guangxu, s, cousin, jingfen, cixi, in, addition, selected, two, concubines, for, the, emperor, who, were, sisters, consorts, jin, and, zhen, guangxu, eventually, would, prefer, to, spend, more, time, with, consort, zhen, neglecting, his, empress, much, to, cixi, s, dismay, in, 1894, cixi, degraded, consort, zhen, citing, intervention, in, political, affairs, as, the, main, reason, according, to, some, reports, she, even, had, her, flogged, consort, jin, had, also, been, implicated, in, consort, zhen, s, reported, influence, peddling, and, also, apparently, suffered, a, similar, punishment, a, cousin, of, theirs, zhirui, was, banished, from, the, capital, to, a, military, outpost, on, 5, march, 1889, cixi, retired, from, her, second, regency, but, nonetheless, served, as, the, effective, head, of, the, imperial, family, many, officials, felt, and, showed, more, loyalty, to, the, empress, dowager, than, they, did, to, the, emperor, owing, in, part, to, her, seniority, and, in, part, to, her, personalised, approach, to, cultivating, court, favourites, many, of, whom, would, be, given, gifts, of, her, artwork, and, invitations, to, join, her, at, the, theater, for, opera, and, acrobatics, in, spite, of, her, residence, for, a, period, of, time, at, the, summer, palace, which, had, been, constructed, with, the, official, intention, of, providing, her, a, suitable, place, to, live, after, retiring, from, political, affairs, cixi, continued, to, influence, the, decisions, and, actions, of, the, guangxu, emperor, even, after, he, began, his, formal, rule, at, age, 19, along, with, an, entourage, of, court, officials, guangxu, would, pay, visits, to, her, every, second, or, third, day, at, which, major, political, decisions, would, be, made, weng, tonghe, observed, that, while, the, emperor, dealt, with, day, to, day, administration, the, grand, councillors, gave, their, advice, in, more, complex, cases, and, in, the, most, complex, cases, of, all, the, advice, of, cixi, was, sought, in, 1894, the, first, sino, japanese, war, broke, out, over, korea, whose, age, old, allegiance, to, beijing, was, wavering, after, the, decisive, victory, and, ensuing, treaty, of, shimonoseki, japan, annexed, taiwan, from, qing, china, during, this, period, cixi, was, continuously, called, upon, to, arbitrate, policy, making, and, the, emperor, was, sometimes, even, bypassed, in, decision, making, processes, cixi, eventually, was, given, copies, of, the, secret, palace, memorials, as, well, a, practice, that, was, carried, on, until, 1898, when, it, became, unnecessary, in, november, 1894, cixi, celebrated, her, 60th, birthday, borrowing, from, the, plans, used, for, the, celebrations, of, the, 70th, and, 80th, birthdays, of, empress, xiaoshengxian, the, qianlong, emperor, s, mother, plans, included, a, triumphal, progress, along, the, decorated, road, between, the, forbidden, city, and, the, summer, palace, decorations, for, the, beijing, city, gates, and, monumental, archways, free, theatrical, performances, remission, of, punishments, and, the, restoration, of, degraded, officials, however, the, war, between, china, and, japan, forced, the, empress, dowager, to, cancel, the, lavish, celebrations, she, had, planned, and, settle, for, a, much, smaller, commemoration, that, was, held, in, the, forbidden, city, after, coming, to, the, throne, guangxu, became, more, reform, minded, after, a, humiliating, defeat, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, of, 1894, during, which, the, chinese, beiyang, fleet, was, virtually, destroyed, by, the, imperial, japanese, navy, the, qing, government, faced, unprecedented, challenges, internally, and, abroad, with, its, very, existence, at, stake, under, the, influence, of, reformist, officials, kang, youwei, and, liang, qichao, guangxu, believed, that, by, learning, from, constitutional, monarchies, such, as, japan, and, germany, china, would, become, politically, and, economically, powerful, in, june, 1898, guangxu, launched, the, hundred, days, reform, aimed, at, sweeping, political, legal, and, social, changes, and, issued, edicts, for, far, reaching, modernising, reforms, these, abrupt, reforms, however, came, without, building, support, either, at, court, or, in, the, bureaucracy, cixi, whether, concerned, that, they, would, check, her, power, or, fearful, that, they, would, lead, to, disorder, stepped, in, to, prevent, them, from, going, further, some, government, and, military, officials, warned, cixi, that, the, ming, shi, reformation, bureau, had, been, geared, toward, conspiracy, allegations, of, treason, against, the, emperor, as, well, as, suspected, japanese, influence, within, the, reform, movement, led, cixi, to, resume, the, role, of, regent, and, resume, control, at, the, court, the, manchu, general, ronglu, on, 21, september, 1898, took, the, emperor, to, ocean, terrace, a, small, palace, on, an, island, in, the, middle, of, zhongnanhai, linked, to, the, rest, of, the, forbidden, city, only, by, a, controlled, causeway, cixi, followed, this, action, with, an, edict, that, proclaimed, guangxu, s, total, disgrace, and, unfitness, to, be, emperor, guangxu, s, reign, effectively, came, to, an, end, according, to, research, by, professor, lei, chia, sheng, during, the, hundred, days, reform, former, japanese, prime, minister, it, hirobumi, arrived, in, china, on, 11, september, 1898, almost, at, the, same, time, british, missionary, timothy, richard, was, invited, to, beijing, by, the, reformist, kang, youwei, richard, suggested, that, china, should, hand, over, some, political, power, to, it, in, order, to, help, push, the, reforms, further, on, 18, september, richard, convinced, kang, to, adopt, a, plan, by, which, china, would, join, a, federation, composed, of, china, japan, the, united, states, and, england, this, suggestion, did, not, reflect, the, policies, of, the, countries, concerned, it, was, richard, s, and, perhaps, it, s, trick, to, convince, china, to, hand, over, national, rights, kang, nonetheless, asked, fellow, reformers, yang, shenxiu, and, song, bolu, to, report, this, plan, to, guangxu, on, 20, september, yang, sent, a, memorial, to, this, effect, to, the, emperor, in, another, memorial, written, the, next, day, song, bolu, also, advocated, the, formation, of, a, federation, and, the, sharing, of, the, diplomatic, fiscal, and, military, powers, of, the, four, countries, under, a, hundred, man, committee, still, according, to, lei, s, findings, on, 13, october, british, ambassador, claude, macdonald, reported, to, his, government, about, the, chinese, situation, saying, that, chinese, reforms, had, been, damaged, by, kang, youwei, and, his, friends, actions, british, diplomat, frederick, bourne, claimed, in, his, own, report, that, kang, was, a, dreamer, who, had, been, seduced, by, timothy, richard, s, sweet, words, bourne, thought, richard, was, a, plotter, the, british, and, u, s, governments, were, unaware, of, the, federation, plot, which, seems, to, have, been, richard, s, personal, idea, because, richard, s, partner, it, hirobumi, had, been, prime, minister, of, japan, the, japanese, government, might, have, known, about, richard, s, plan, but, there, is, no, evidence, to, this, effect, a, crisis, over, the, issue, of, abdication, emerged, bowing, to, increasing, pressure, from, the, west, and, general, civil, discontent, cixi, did, not, forcibly, remove, guangxu, from, the, throne, although, she, attempted, to, have, pujun, a, boy, of, 14, who, was, from, a, close, branch, of, the, imperial, family, installed, as, crown, prince, the, guangxu, era, nominally, continued, until, his, death, in, 1908, but, the, emperor, lost, all, respect, power, and, privileges, including, his, freedom, of, movement, most, of, his, supporters, including, his, political, mentor, kang, youwei, fled, into, exile, and, the, six, prominent, reformers, including, tan, sitong, and, kang, s, younger, brother, were, publicly, beheaded, kang, continued, to, work, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, while, in, exile, remaining, loyal, to, guangxu, and, hoping, eventually, to, restore, him, to, power, his, efforts, would, prove, to, be, in, vain, in, 1900, the, boxer, rebellion, broke, out, in, northern, china, perhaps, fearing, further, foreign, intervention, cixi, threw, her, support, to, these, anti, foreign, bands, by, making, an, official, announcement, of, her, support, for, the, movement, and, a, formal, declaration, of, war, on, the, western, powers, the, general, ronglu, deliberately, sabotaged, the, performance, of, the, imperial, army, during, the, rebellion, dong, fuxiang, s, muslim, troops, the, kansu, braves, were, able, and, eager, to, destroy, the, foreign, military, forces, in, the, legations, but, ronglu, stopped, them, from, doing, so, the, manchu, prince, zaiyi, was, xenophobic, and, friendly, with, dong, fuxiang, zaiyi, wanted, artillery, for, dong, s, troops, to, destroy, the, legations, ronglu, blocked, the, transfer, of, artillery, to, zaiyi, and, dong, preventing, them, from, destroying, the, legations, when, artillery, was, finally, supplied, to, the, imperial, army, and, boxers, it, was, done, in, only, limited, amounts, ronglu, deliberately, held, back, the, rest, of, them, the, chinese, forces, defeated, the, small, 2, 000, man, western, relief, force, at, the, battle, of, langfang, but, lost, several, decisive, battles, including, the, battle, of, beicang, and, the, entire, imperial, court, was, forced, to, retreat, as, the, forces, of, the, eight, nation, alliance, invaded, beijing, because, moderates, at, the, qing, imperial, court, tried, to, appease, the, foreigners, by, moving, the, muslim, kansu, braves, out, of, their, way, the, allied, army, was, able, to, march, into, beijing, and, seize, the, capital, during, the, war, cixi, displayed, concern, about, china, s, situation, and, foreign, aggression, saying, perhaps, their, magic, is, not, to, be, relied, upon, but, can, we, not, rely, on, the, hearts, and, minds, of, the, people, today, china, is, extremely, weak, we, have, only, the, people, s, hearts, and, minds, to, depend, upon, if, we, cast, them, aside, and, lose, the, people, s, hearts, what, can, we, use, to, sustain, the, country, the, chinese, people, were, almost, unanimous, in, their, support, for, the, boxers, due, to, the, western, allied, invasion, when, cixi, received, an, ultimatum, demanding, that, china, surrender, total, control, over, all, its, military, and, financial, affairs, to, foreigners, she, defiantly, stated, before, the, grand, council, now, they, have, started, the, aggression, and, the, extinction, of, our, nation, is, imminent, if, we, just, fold, our, arms, and, yield, to, them, i, would, have, no, face, to, see, our, ancestors, after, death, if, we, must, perish, why, not, fight, to, the, death, it, was, at, this, point, that, cixi, began, to, blockade, the, legations, with, the, armies, of, the, beijing, field, force, which, began, the, siege, cixi, stated, that, i, have, always, been, of, the, opinion, that, the, allied, armies, had, been, permitted, to, escape, too, easily, in, 1860, only, a, united, effort, was, then, necessary, to, have, given, china, the, victory, today, at, last, the, opportunity, for, revenge, has, come, and, said, that, millions, of, chinese, would, join, the, cause, of, fighting, the, foreigners, since, the, manchus, had, provided, great, benefits, to, china, during, the, battle, of, beijing, the, entire, imperial, court, including, cixi, and, guangxu, fled, beijing, and, evacuated, to, xi, an, as, the, allied, forces, invaded, the, city, after, the, fall, of, beijing, the, eight, nation, alliance, negotiated, a, treaty, with, the, qing, government, sending, messengers, to, the, empress, dowager, in, xi, an, included, in, the, terms, of, the, agreement, was, a, guarantee, that, china, would, not, have, to, give, up, any, further, territories, to, foreign, powers, many, of, cixi, s, advisers, in, the, imperial, court, insisted, that, the, war, against, the, foreigners, be, continued, they, recommended, that, dong, fuxiang, be, given, responsibility, to, continue, the, war, effort, cixi, was, practical, however, and, decided, that, the, terms, were, generous, enough, for, her, to, acquiesce, and, stop, the, war, at, least, after, she, was, assured, of, her, continued, reign, when, the, war, was, concluded, the, western, powers, needed, a, government, strong, enough, to, suppress, further, anti, foreign, movements, but, too, weak, to, act, on, its, own, they, supported, the, continuation, of, the, qing, dynasty, rather, than, allowing, it, to, be, overthrown, cixi, turned, once, more, to, li, hongzhang, to, negotiate, li, agreed, to, sign, the, boxer, protocol, which, stipulated, the, presence, of, an, international, military, force, in, beijing, and, the, payment, of, 67, million, almost, 333, million, in, war, reparations, the, united, states, used, its, share, of, the, war, indemnity, to, fund, the, creation, of, china, s, prestigious, tsinghua, university, guangxu, and, cixi, did, not, return, to, beijing, from, xi, an, until, roughly, 18, months, after, their, flight, in, january, 1902, cixi, guangxu, the, empress, and, the, rest, of, the, court, made, a, ceremonious, return, to, beijing, at, the, railhead, at, chengtingfu, cixi, and, the, court, boarded, a, 21, car, train, to, convey, them, the, rest, of, the, way, to, the, capital, in, beijing, many, of, the, legation, women, turned, out, to, watch, the, procession, from, the, beijing, railway, station, to, the, forbidden, city, and, for, the, first, time, commoners, were, permitted, to, watch, as, well, once, back, in, the, palace, cixi, implemented, sweeping, political, reforms, high, officials, were, dispatched, to, japan, and, europe, to, gather, facts, and, draw, up, plans, for, sweeping, administrative, reforms, in, law, education, government, structure, and, social, policy, many, of, which, were, modeled, on, the, reforms, of, the, meiji, restoration, the, abolition, of, the, examination, system, in, 1905, was, only, the, most, visible, of, these, sweeping, reforms, ironically, cixi, sponsored, the, implementation, of, the, new, policies, a, reform, program, more,
