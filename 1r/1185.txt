empire, as, mercenaries, they, fought, the, enemies, of, the, italian, city, states, sometimes, fighting, for, the, byzantines, and, sometimes, against, them, but, in, the, following, century, they, gradually, became, the, rulers, of, the, major, polities, south, of, rome, roger, i, ruled, the, county, of, sicily, at, the, time, of, the, birth, of, his, youngest, son, roger, at, mileto, calabria, in, 1095, roger, i, s, nephew, roger, borsa, was, the, duke, of, apulia, and, calabria, and, his, great, nephew, richard, ii, of, capua, was, the, prince, of, capua, alongside, these, three, major, rulers, were, a, large, number, of, minor, counts, who, effectively, exercised, sovereign, power, in, their, own, localities, these, counts, at, least, nominally, owed, allegiance, to, one, of, these, three, norman, rulers, but, such, allegiance, was, usually, weak, and, often, ignored, when, roger, i, died, in, 1101, his, young, son, simon, became, count, with, his, mother, adelaide, del, vasto, as, regent, simon, died, four, years, later, in, 1105, at, the, age, of, 12, adelaide, continued, as, regent, to, her, younger, son, roger, who, was, nine, upon, the, death, in, 1105, of, his, elder, brother, simon, of, hauteville, roger, inherited, the, county, of, sicily, under, the, regency, of, his, mother, adelaide, del, vasto, his, mother, was, assisted, by, such, notables, as, christodulus, the, greek, emir, of, palermo, in, 1109, byzantine, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, bestowed, upon, him, the, title, of, protonobilissimos, in, recognition, of, his, knowledge, of, the, byzantine, court, in, the, summer, of, 1110, roger, was, visited, by, the, norwegian, king, sigurd, the, crusader, who, was, on, his, way, to, jerusalem, the, story, in, icelandic, sources, suggests, that, sigurd, called, roger, the, king, of, sicily, twenty, years, before, the, latter, actually, obtained, this, title, in, 1112, at, the, age, of, sixteen, roger, began, his, personal, rule, being, named, now, knight, now, count, of, sicily, and, calabria, in, a, charter, document, dated, 12, june, 1112, in, 1117, his, mother, who, had, married, baldwin, i, of, jerusalem, returned, to, sicily, since, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, had, declared, the, marriage, invalid, roger, seems, to, have, felt, the, slight, and, this, might, explain, his, later, reluctance, to, go, crusading, roger, married, his, first, wife, elvira, daughter, of, king, alfonso, vi, of, castile, and, later, his, fourth, wife, isabella, who, may, be, identical, to, his, former, concubine, the, converted, moor, zaida, who, was, baptized, with, the, name, of, isabella, in, 1122, duke, william, ii, of, apulia, who, was, fighting, with, count, jordan, of, ariano, offered, to, renounce, his, remaining, claims, to, sicily, as, well, as, part, of, calabria, roger, in, exchange, provided, william, with, 600, knights, and, access, to, money, for, his, campaign, when, william, ii, of, apulia, died, childless, in, july, 1127, roger, claimed, all, hauteville, family, possessions, in, the, peninsula, as, well, as, the, overlordship, of, the, principality, of, capua, which, had, been, nominally, given, to, apulia, almost, thirty, years, earlier, however, the, union, of, sicily, and, apulia, was, resisted, by, pope, honorius, ii, and, by, the, subjects, of, the, duchy, itself, the, popes, had, long, been, suspicious, of, the, growth, of, norman, power, in, southern, italy, and, at, capua, in, december, the, pope, preached, a, crusade, against, roger, setting, robert, ii, of, capua, and, ranulf, ii, of, alife, his, own, brother, in, law, against, him, after, this, coalition, failed, in, august, 1128, honorius, invested, roger, at, benevento, as, duke, of, apulia, the, baronial, resistance, backed, by, naples, bari, salerno, and, other, cities, whose, aim, was, civic, freedom, gave, way, in, september, 1129, roger, was, generally, recognized, as, duke, of, apulia, by, sergius, vii, of, naples, robert, of, capua, and, the, rest, he, began, at, once, to, enforce, order, in, the, duchy, where, ducal, power, had, long, been, fading, on, the, death, of, pope, honorius, in, february, 1130, there, were, two, claimants, to, the, papal, throne, roger, supported, antipope, anacletus, ii, against, innocent, ii, the, reward, was, a, crown, and, on, 27, september, 1130, anacletus, papal, bull, made,

could, not, have, been, used, for, his, coronation, this, lavish, item, made, for, special, events, to, show, power, and, regality, was, most, likely, worn, as, a, symbol, of, the, norman, s, victory, and, new, dynasty, in, sicily, it, was, later, used, as, a, coronation, cloak, by, the, holy, roman, emperors, and, is, now, in, the, imperial, treasury, schatzkammer, in, vienna, the, mantle, is, an, example, of, the, normans, multicultural, court, and, a, mark, of, trade, in, palermo, it, is, a, luxury, object, made, from, red, silk, imported, from, the, byzantine, empire, its, outer, panels,

roger, sent, john, of, palermo, across, the, strait, of, messina, to, join, up, with, a, royal, troop, from, apulia, and, calabria, and, march, on, amalfi, by, land, while, george, of, antioch, blockaded, the, town, by, sea, and, set, up, a, base, on, capri, amalfi, soon, capitulated, in, 1132, roger, sent, robert, ii, of, capua, and, ranulf, ii, of, alife, to, rome, in, a, show, of, force, in, support, of, anacletus, while, they, were, away, roger, s, half, sister, matilda, ranulf, s, wife, fled, to, roger, claiming, abuse, simultaneously, roger, annexed, ranulf, s, brother, s, county, of, avellino, ranulf, demanded, the, restitution, of, both, wife, and, countship, both, were, denied, and, ranulf, left, rome, against, orders, with, robert, following, first, roger, dealt, with, a, rebellion, in, apulia, where, he, defeated, and, deposed, grimoald, prince, of, bari, replacing, him, with, his, second, son, tancred, meanwhile, robert, and, ranulf, took, papal, benevento, roger, went, to, meet, them, but, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, nocera, on, 25, july, 1132, he, retreated, to, salerno, the, next, year, lothair, iii, came, down, to, rome, for, his, imperial, coronation, the, rebel, leaders, met, him, there, but, they, were, refused, help, because, lothair, s, force, was, too, small, with, the, emperor, s, departure, divisions, in, his, opponents, ranks, allowed, roger, to, reverse, his, fortunes, by, july, 1134, his, troops, had, forced, ranulf, sergius, and, the, other, ringleaders, to, submit, robert, was, expelled, from, capua, and, roger, installed, his, third, son, alfonso, of, hauteville, as, prince, of, capua, roger, ii, s, eldest, son, roger, was, given, the, title, of, duke, of, apulia, meanwhile, lothair, s, contemplated, attack, upon, roger, had, gained, the, backing, of, the, republic, of, pisa, the, republic, of, genoa, and, the, byzantine, emperor, john, ii, each, of, whom, feared, the, growth, of, a, powerful, norman, kingdom, a, pisan, fleet, led, by, the, exiled, prince, of, capua, dropped, anchor, off, naples, in, 1135, ranulf, joined, robert, and, sergius, there, encouraged, by, news, coming, from, sicily, that, roger, was, fatally, ill, or, even, already, dead, the, important, fortress, of, aversa, among, others, passed, to, the, rebels, and, only, capua, resisted, under, the, royal, chancellor, guarin, on, 5, june, however, roger, disembarked, in, salerno, much, to, the, surprise, of, all, the, mainland, provinces, the, royal, army, split, into, several, forces, easily, conquered, aversa, and, even, alife, the, base, of, the, natural, rebel, leader, ranulf, most, of, the, rebels, took, refuge, in, naples, which, was, besieged, in, july, but, despite, poor, health, conditions, within, the, city, roger, was, unable, to, take, it, and, returned, to, messina, late, in, the, year, in, 1136, the, long, awaited, imperial, army, led, by, lothair, and, the, duke, of, bavaria, henry, the, proud, descended, the, peninsula, to, support, the, three, rebels, henry, robert, and, ranulf, took, a, large, contingent, of, troops, to, besiege, the, peninsular, capital, of, the, kingdom, salerno, roger, remained, in, sicily, leaving, its, mainland, garrisons, helpless, under, the, chancellor, robert, of, selby, while, even, the, byzantine, emperor, john, ii, comnenus, sent, subsidies, to, lothair, salerno, surrendered, and, the, large, army, of, germans, and, normans, marched, to, the, very, south, of, apulia, there, in, june, 1137, lothair, besieged, and, took, bari, at, san, severino, after, the, victorious, campaign, he, and, the, pope, jointly, invested, ranulf, as, duke, of, apulia, in, august, 1137, and, the, emperor, then, retired, to, germany, roger, freed, from, the, utmost, danger, immediately, disembarked, in, calabria, at, tropea, with, 400, knights, and, other, troops, probably, mostly, muslims, after, having, been, welcomed, by, the, salernitans, he, recovered, ground, in, campania, sacking, pozzuoli, alife, capua, and, avellino, sergius, was, forced, to, acknowledge, him, as, overlord, of, naples, and, switch, his, allegiance, to, anacletus, this, moment, marked, the, fall, of, an, independent, neapolitan, duchy, and, thereafter, the, ancient, city, was, fully, integrated, into, the, norman, realm, from, there, roger, moved, to, benevento, and, northern, apulia, where, duke, ranulf, although, steadily, losing, his, bases, of, power, had, some, german, troops, plus, some, 1, 500, knights, from, the, cities, of, melfi, trani, troia, and, bari, who, were, ready, to, die, rather, than, lead, a, miserable, life, on, 30, october, 1137, at, the, battle, of, rignano, next, to, monte, gargano, the, younger, roger, and, his, father, with, sergius, of, naples, met, the, defensive, army, of, duke, ranulf, it, was, the, greatest, defeat, of, roger, ii, s, career, sergius, died, and, roger, fled, to, salerno, it, capped, ranulf, s, meteoric, career, twice, victor, over, roger, anacletus, ii, died, in, january, 1138, but, innocent, ii, refused, to, reconcile, with, the, king, in, spring, 1138, the, royal, army, invaded, the, principality, of, capua, with, the, precise, intent, of, avoiding, a, pitched, battle, and, of, dispersing, ranulf, s, army, with, a, series, of, marches, through, difficult, terrain, while, the, count, of, alife, hesitated, roger, now, supported, by, benevento, destroyed, all, the, rebels, castles, in, the, region, capturing, an, immense, booty, in, april, 1139, at, the, second, council, of, the, lateran, innocent, ii, declared, roger, excommunicated, ranulf, himself, who, had, taken, refuge, in, his, capital, troia, died, of, malarial, fever, on, 30, april, 1139, roger, exhumed, his, body, from, his, grave, in, troia, cathedral, and, threw, it, in, a, ditch, only, to, repent, subsequently, and, rebury, him, decently, at, this, time, with, sergius, dead, alfonso, was, elected, to, replace, him, and, together, with, his, brother, roger, went, off, to, conquer, the, abruzzi, after, the, death, of, anacletus, in, january, 1138, roger, had, sought, the, confirmation, of, his, title, from, innocent, however, the, pope, wanted, an, independent, principality, of, capua, as, a, buffer, state, between, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, the, papal, states, something, roger, would, not, accept, in, the, summer, of, 1139, innocent, ii, invaded, the, kingdom, with, a, large, army, but, was, ambushed, on, 22, july, 1139, at, galluccio, southeast, of, present, day, cassino, by, roger, s, son, and, was, captured, three, days, later, by, the, treaty, of, mignano, the, pope, proclaimed, roger, ii, rex, siciliae, ducatus, apuliae, et, principatus, capuae, king, of, sicily, duke, of, apulia, and, commander, of, capua, the, boundaries, of, his, regno, were, only, later, fixed, by, a, truce, with, the, pope, in, october, 1144, these, lands, were, for, the, next, seven, centuries, to, constitute, the, kingdoms, of, naples, and, sicily, in, 1139, bari, the, 50, 000, inhabitants, of, which, had, remained, unscathed, behind, its, massive, walls, during, the, wars, of, the, past, year, decided, to, surrender, the, excellentissimus, princeps, jaquintus, who, had, led, the, rebellion, of, the, city, was, hanged, along, with, many, of, his, followers, but, the, city, avoided, being, sacked, roger, s, execution, of, the, prince, and, his, counsellors, was, perhaps, the, most, violent, act, of, his, life, while, his, sons, overcame, pockets, of, resistance, on, the, mainland, on, 5, november, 1139, roger, returned, to, palermo, to, plan, a, great, act, of, legislation, the, assizes, of, ariano, an, attempt, to, establish, his, dominions, in, southern, italy, as, a, coherent, state, he, returned, to, check, on, his, sons, progress, in, 1140, and, then, went, to, ariano, a, town, central, to, the, peninsular, possessions, and, a, center, of, rebellion, under, his, predecessors, there, he, promulgated, the, great, law, regulating, all, sicilian, affairs, it, invested, the, king, and, his, bureaucracy, with, absolute, powers, and, reduced, the, authority, of, the, often, rebellious, vassals, while, there, centralising, his, kingdom, roger, declared, a, new, standard, coinage, named, after, the, duchy, of, apulia, the, ducat, roger, s, reforms, in, laws, and, administration, aimed, not, only, to, strengthen, his, rule, but, also, to, improve, the, economic, standing, of, sicily, and, southern, italy, he, was, very, concerned, to, gain, money, but, hardly, very, prodigal, in, expending, it, in, 1140, at, his, assembly, at, ariano, he, introduced, new, coinage, including, smaller, denominations, to, facilitate, trade, with, the, rest, of, the, mediterranean, however, although, this, new, coinage, made, long, distance, trade, easier, it, was, detrimental, to, local, trade, which, spread, hatred, throughout, italy, by, the, 1150s, most, of, this, coinage, was, no, longer, in, use, and, soon, after, it, disappeared, altogether, nevertheless, the, controversy, over, the, coinage, did, not, hinder, the, kingdom, s, prosperity, roger, ii, had, acquired, large, wealth, not, only, through, his, royal, patrimony, but, also, through, his, military, campaigns, and, their, financial, rewards, for, example, gold, and, silver, were, gained, through, the, campaigns, in, apulia, in, 1133, and, greece, in, 1147, sicily, s, geographic, situation, at, the, centre, of, the, mediterranean, favored, trade, with, europe, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, its, primary, export, was, durum, wheat, others, included, foods, like, cheese, and, vine, fruits, unlike, other, states, sicily, also, had, a, strong, political, and, military, standing, so, its, merchants, were, supported, and, to, some, extent, protected, this, standing, allowed, for, an, increase, in, internal, trade, and, a, stronger, market, which, led, to, noticeable, developments, in, agriculture, roger, had, now, become, one, of, the, greatest, kings, in, europe, at, palermo, he, gathered, round, him, distinguished, men, from, a, variety, of, ethnicities, and, cultures, such, as, the, famous, arab, geographer, muhammad, al, idrisi, and, the, byzantine, greek, historian, nilus, doxopatrius, or, neilos, doxapatres, sicily, in, the, center, of, the, mediterranean, and, a, natural, stopping, point, for, people, traveling, across, it, had, been, run, by, several, different, groups, in, its, history, and, roger, welcomed, the, learned, and, practiced, tolerance, toward, the, several, religions, ethnicities, and, languages, of, his, realm, to, administer, his, domain, he, hired, many, greeks, and, arabs, who, were, trained, in, long, established, traditions, of, centralized, government, he, was, served, by, men, of, several, nationalities, such, as, the, englishman, thomas, brun, a, kaid, of, the, curia, and, in, the, fleet, by, two, greeks, first, christodulus, and, then, george, of, antioch, whom, he, made, in, 1132, ammiratus, ammiratorum, or, emir, of, emirs, in, effect, prime, vizier, this, title, later, became, the, english, word, admiral, roger, made, sicily, the, leading, maritime, power, in, the, mediterranean, a, powerful, fleet, was, built, up, under, several, admirals, or, emirs, of, whom, the, greatest, was, george, formerly, in, the, service, of, the, muslim, prince, of, mahdia, mainly, thanks, to, him, a, series, of, conquests, were, made, on, the, african, coast, 1146, 1153, from, 1135, roger, ii, started, to, conquer, the, coast, of, tunisia, and, enlarge, his, dominions, tripoli, was, captured, in, 1146, and, cape, bona, in, 1148, these, conquests, were, lost, in, the, reign, of, roger, s, successor, william, however, and, never, formed, an, integral, part, of, the, kingdom, in, southern, italy, the, second, crusade, 1147, 1148, offered, roger, an, opportunity, to, revive, attacks, on, the, byzantine, empire, the, traditional, norman, enemy, to, the, east, it, also, afforded, him, an, opportunity, through, the, agency, of, theodwin, a, cardinal, ever, vigilant, for, crusade, supporters, to, strike, up, a, correspondence, with, conrad, iii, of, germany, in, an, effort, to, break, his, alliance, with, manuel, i, comnenus, roger, himself, never, went, on, an, expedition, against, byzantium, instead, handing, command, to, the, skillful, george, in, 1147, george, set, sail, from, otranto, with, seventy, galleys, to, attack, corfu, according, to, nicetas, choniates, the, island, capitulated, thanks, to, george, s, bribes, and, the, tax, burden, of, the, imperial, government, welcoming, the, normans, as, their, liberators, leaving, a, garrison, of, 1, 000, men, george, sailed, on, to, the, peloponnesus, he, sacked, athens, and, quickly, moved, on, to, the, aegean, islands, he, ravaged, the, coast, all, along, euboea, and, the, gulf, of, corinth, and, penetrated, as, far, as, thebes, where, he, pillaged, the, silk, factories, and, carried, off, the, jewish, damask, brocade, and, silk, weavers, taking, them, back, to, palermo, where, they, formed, the, basis, for, the, sicilian, silk, industry, george, capped, the, expedition, with, a, sack, of, corinth, in, which, the, relics, of, saint, theodore, were, stolen, and, then, returned, to, sicily, in, 1149, however, corfu, was, retaken, george, went, on, a, punitive, expedition, against, constantinople, but, could, not, land, and, instead, defied, the, byzantine, emperor, by, firing, arrows, against, the, palace, windows, despite, this, act, his, expedition, left, no, enduring, effects, roger, died, at, palermo, on, 26, february, 1154, and, was, buried, in, the, cathedral, of,
