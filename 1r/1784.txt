niels, henrik, abel, b, l, ah, b, l, norwegian, 5, august, 1802, 6, april, 1829, was, a, norwegian, mathematician, who, made, pioneering, contributions, in, a, variety, of, fields, his, most, famous, single, result, is, the, first, complete, proof, demonstrating, the, impossibility, of, solving, the, general, quintic, equation, in, radicals, this, question, was, one, of, the, outstanding, open, problems, of, his, day, and, had, been, unresolved, for, over, 250, years, he, was, also, an, innovator, in, the, field, of, elliptic, functions, and, the, discoverer, of, abelian, functions, he, made, his, discoveries, while, living, in, poverty, and, died, at, the, age, of, 26, from, tuberculosis, most, of, his, work, was, done, in, six, or, seven, years, of, his, working, life, regarding, abel, the, french, mathematician, charles, hermite, said, abel, has, left, mathematicians, enough, to, keep, them, busy, for, five, hundred, years, another, french, mathematician, adrien, marie, legendre, said, what, a, head, the, young, norwegian, has, the, abel, prize, in, mathematics, originally, proposed, in, 1899, to, complement, the, nobel, prizes, but, first, awarded, in, 2003, is, named, in, his, honour, niels, henrik, abel, was, born, prematurely, in, nedstrand, norway, as, the, second, child, of, the, pastor, s, ren, georg, abel, and, anne, marie, simonsen, when, niels, henrik, abel, was, born, the, family, was, living, at, a, rectory, on, finn, y, much, suggests, that, niels, henrik, was, born, in, the, neighboring, parish, as, his, parents, were, guests, of, the, bailiff, in, nedstrand, in, july, august, of, his, year, of, birth, niels, henrik, abel, s, father, s, ren, georg, abel, had, a, degree, in, theology, and, philosophy, and, served, as, pastor, at, finn, y, s, ren, s, father, niels, s, grandfather, hans, mathias, abel, was, also, a, pastor, at, gjerstad, church, near, the, town, of, ris, r, s, ren, had, spent, his, childhood, at, gjerstad, and, had, also, served, as, chaplain, there, and, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1804, s, ren, was, appointed, pastor, at, gjerstad, and, the, family, moved, there, the, abel, family, originated, in, schleswig, and, came, to, norway, in, the, 17th, century, anne, marie, simonsen, was, from, ris, r, her, father, niels, henrik, saxild, simonsen, was, a, tradesman, and, merchant, ship, owner, and, said, to, be, the, richest, person, in, ris, r, anne, marie, had, grown, up, with, two, stepmothers, in, relatively, luxurious, surroundings, at, gjerstad, rectory, she, enjoyed, arranging, balls, and, social, gatherings, much, suggests, she, was, early, on, an, alcoholic, and, took, little, interest, in, the, upbringing, of, the, children, niels, henrik, and, his, brothers, were, given, their, schooling, by, their, father, with, handwritten, books, to, read, an, addition, table, in, a, book, of, mathematics, reads, 1, 0, 0, with, norwegian, independence, and, the, first, election, held, in, norway, in, 1814, s, ren, abel, was, elected, as, a, representative, to, the, storting, meetings, of, the, storting, were, held, until, 1866, in, the, main, hall, of, the, cathedral, school, in, christiania, now, known, as, oslo, almost, certainly, this, is, how, he, came, into, contact, with, the, school, and, he, decided, that, his, eldest, son, hans, mathias, should, start, there, the, following, year, however, when, the, time, for, his, departure, approached, hans, was, so, saddened, and, depressed, over, having, to, leave, home, that, his, father, did, not, dare, send, him, away, he, decided, to, send, niels, instead, in, 1815, niels, abel, entered, the, cathedral, school, at, the, age, of, 13, his, elder, brother, hans, joined, him, there, a, year, later, they, shared, rooms, and, had, classes, together, hans, got, better, grades, than, niels, however, a, new, mathematics, teacher, bernt, michael, holmboe, was, appointed, in, 1818, he, gave, the, students, mathematical, tasks, to, do, at, home, he, saw, niels, henrik, s, talent, in, mathematics, and, encouraged, him, to, study, the, subject, to, an, advanced, level, he, even, gave, niels, private, lessons, after, school, in, 1818, s, ren, abel, had, a, public, theological, argument, with, the, theologian, stener, johannes, stenersen, regarding, his, catechism, from, 1806, the, argument, was, well, covered, in, the, press, s, ren, was, given, the, nickname, abel, treating, norwegian, abel, spandabel, niels, reaction, to, the, quarrel, was, said, to, have, been, excessive, gaiety, at, the, same, time, s, ren, also, almost, faced, impeachment, after, insulting, carsten, anker, the, host, of, the, norwegian, constituent, assembly, and, in, september, 1818, he, returned, to, gjerstad, with, his, political, career, in, ruins, he, began, drinking, heavily, and, died, only, two, years, later, in, 1820, aged, 48, bernt, michael, holmboe, supported, niels, henrik, abel, with, a, scholarship, to, remain, at, the, school, and, raised, money, from, his, friends, to, enable, him, to, study, at, the, royal, frederick, university, when, abel, entered, the, university, in, 1821, he, was, already, the, most, knowledgeable, mathematician, in, norway, holmboe, had, nothing, more, he, could, teach, him, and, abel, had, studied, all, the, latest, mathematical, literature, in, the, university, library, during, that, time, abel, started, working, on, the, quintic, equation, in, radicals, mathematicians, had, been, looking, for, a, solution, to, this, problem, for, over, 250, years, in, 1821, abel, thought, he, had, found, the, solution, the, two, professors, of, mathematics, in, christiania, s, ren, rasmussen, and, christopher, hansteen, found, no, errors, in, abel, s, formulas, and, sent, the, work, on, to, the, leading, mathematician, in, the, nordic, countries, carl, ferdinand, degen, in, copenhagen, he, too, found, no, faults, but, still, doubted, that, the, solution, which, so, many, outstanding, mathematicians, had, sought, for, so, long, could, really, have, been, found, by, an, unknown, student, in, far, off, christiania, degen, noted, however, abel, s, unusually, sharp, mind, and, believed, that, such, a, talented, young, man, should, not, waste, his, abilities, on, such, a, sterile, object, as, the, fifth, degree, equation, but, rather, on, elliptic, functions, and, transcendence, for, then, wrote, degen, he, would, discover, magellanian, thoroughfares, to, large, portions, of, a, vast, analytical, ocean, degen, asked, abel, to, give, a, numerical, example, of, his, method, while, trying, to, provide, an, example, abel, found, a, mistake, in, his, paper, this, led, to, a, discovery, in, 1823, that, a, solution, by, formula, to, a, fifth, or, higher, degree, equation, was, not, necessarily, possible, abel, graduated, in, 1822, his, performance, was, exceptionally, high, in, mathematics, and, average, in, other, matters, after, he, graduated, professors, from, university, supported, abel, financially, and, professor, christopher, hansteen, let, him, live, in, a, room, in, the, attic, of, his, home, abel, would, later, view, ms, hansteen, as, his, second, mother, while, living, here, abel, helped, his, younger, brother, peder, abel, through, examen, artium, he, also, helped, his, sister, elisabeth, to, find, work, in, the, town, in, early, 1823, niels, abel, published, his, first, article, in, magazin, for, naturvidenskaberne, norway, s, first, scientific, journal, which, had, been, co, founded, by, professor, hansteen, abel, published, several, articles, but, the, journal, soon, realized, that, this, was, not, material, for, the, common, reader, in, 1823, abel, also, wrote, a, paper, in, french, it, was, a, general, representation, of, the, possibility, to, integrate, all, differential, formulas, norwegian, en, alminnelig, fremstilling, af, muligheten, at, integrere, alle, mulige, differential, formler, he, applied, for, funds, at, the, university, to, publish, it, however, the, work, was, lost, while, being, reviewed, never, to, be, found, thereafter, in, mid, 1823, professor, rasmussen, gave, abel, a, gift, of, 100, speciedaler, so, he, could, travel, to, copenhagen, and, visit, ferdinand, degen, and, other, mathematicians, there, while, in, copenhagen, abel, did, some, work, on, fermat, s, last, theorem, abel, s, uncle, peder, mandrup, tuxen, lived, at, the, naval, base, in, christianshavn, copenhagen, and, at, a, ball, there, niels, abel, met, christine, kemp, his, future, fianc, e, in, 1824, christine, moved, to, son, norway, to, work, as, a, governess, and, the, couple, got, engaged, over, christmas, after, returning, from, copenhagen, abel, applied, for, a, government, scholarship, in, order, to, visit, top, mathematicians, in, germany, and, france, but, he, was, instead, granted, 200, speciedaler, yearly, for, two, years, to, stay, in, christiania, and, study, german, and, french, in, the, next, two, years, he, was, promised, a, scholarship, of, 600, speciedaler, yearly, and, he, would, then, be, permitted, to, travel, abroad, while, studying, these, languages, abel, published, his, first, notable, work, in, 1824, m, moire, sur, les, quations, alg, briques, o, on, d, montre, l, impossibilit, de, la, r, solution, de, l, quation, g, n, rale, du, cinqui, me, degr, memoir, on, algebraic, equations, in, which, the, impossibility, of, solving, the, general, equation, of, the, fifth, degree, is, proven, by, 1823, abel, had, at, last, proved, the, impossibility, of, solving, the, quintic, equation, in, radicals, now, referred, to, as, the, abel, ruffini, theorem, however, this, paper, was, in, an, abstruse, and, difficult, form, in, part, because, he, had, restricted, himself, to, only, six, pages, in, order, to, save, money, on, printing, a, more, detailed, proof, was, published, in, 1826, in, the, first, volume, of, crelle, s, journal, in, 1825, abel, wrote, a, personal, letter, to, king, carl, johan, of, norway, sweden, requesting, permission, to, travel, abroad, he, was, granted, this, permission, and, in, september, 1825, he, left, christiania, together, with, four, friends, from, university, christian, p, b, boeck, balthazar, m, keilhau, nicolay, b, m, ller, and, otto, tank, these, four, friends, of, abel, were, traveling, to, berlin, and, to, the, alps, to, study, geology, abel, wanted, to, follow, them, to, copenhagen, and, from, there, make, his, way, to, g, ttingen, the, terms, for, his, scholarship, stipulated, that, he, was, to, visit, gauss, in, g, ttingen, and, then, continue, to, paris, however, when, he, got, as, far, as, copenhagen, he, changed, his, plans, he, wanted, to, follow, his, friends, to, berlin, instead, intending, to, visit, g, ttingen, and, paris, afterwards, on, the, way, he, visited, the, astronomer, heinrich, christian, schumacher, in, altona, now, a, district, of, hamburg, he, then, spent, four, months, in, berlin, where, he, became, well, acquainted, with, august, leopold, crelle, who, was, then, about, to, publish, his, mathematical, journal, journal, f, r, die, reine, und, angewandte, mathematik, this, project, was, warmly, encouraged, by, abel, who, contributed, much, to, the, success, of, the, venture, abel, contributed, seven, articles, to, it, in, its, first, year, from, berlin, abel, also, followed, his, friends, to, the, alps, he, went, to, leipzig, and, freiberg, to, visit, georg, amadeus, carl, friedrich, naumann, and, his, brother, the, mathematician, august, naumann, in, freiberg, abel, did, research, in, the, theory, of, functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and, a, new, class, now, known, as, abelian, functions, from, freiberg, they, went, on, to, dresden, prague, vienna, trieste, venice, verona, bolzano, innsbruck, luzern, and, basel, from, july, 1826, abel, traveled, on, his, own, from, basel, to, paris, abel, had, sent, most, of, his, work, to, berlin, to, be, published, in, crelle, s, journal, but, he, had, saved, what, he, regarded, as, his, most, important, work, for, the, french, academy, of, sciences, a, theorem, on, addition, of, algebraic, differentials, with, the, help, of, a, painter, johan, g, rbitz, he, found, an, apartment, in, paris, and, continued, his, work, on, the, theorem, he, finished, in, october, 1826, and, submitted, it, to, the, academy, it, was, to, be, reviewed, by, augustin, louis, cauchy, abel, s, work, was, scarcely, known, in, paris, and, his, modesty, restrained, him, from, proclaiming, his, research, the, theorem, was, put, aside, and, forgotten, until, his, death, abel, s, limited, finances, finally, compelled, him, to, abandon, his, tour, in, january, 1827, he, returned, to, berlin, and, was, offered, a, position, as, editor, of, crelle, s, journal, but, opted, out, by, may, 1827, he, was, back, in, norway, his, tour, abroad, was, viewed, as, a, failure, he, had, not, visited, gauss, in, g, ttingen, and, he, had, not, published, anything, in, paris, his, scholarship, was, therefore, not, renewed, and, he, had, to, take, up, a, private, loan, in, norges, bank, of, 200, spesidaler, he, never, repaid, this, loan, he, also, started, tutoring, he, continued, to, send, most, of, his, work, to, crelle, s, journal, but, in, mid, 1828, he, published, in, rivalry, with, carl, jacobi, an, important, work, on, elliptic, functions, in, astronomische, nachrichten, in, altona, while, in, paris, abel, contracted, tuberculosis, at, christmas, 1828, he, traveled, by, sled, to, froland, norway, to, visit, his, fianc, e, he, became, seriously, ill, on, the, journey, although, a, temporary, improvement, allowed, the, couple, to, enjoy, the, holiday, together, he, died, relatively, soon, after, on, 6, april, 1829, just, two, days, before, a, letter, arrived, from, august, crelle, telling, abel, that, crelle, had, secured, him, an, appointment, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, berlin, abel, showed, that, there, is, no, general, algebraic, solution, for, the, roots, of, a, quintic, equation, or, any, general, polynomial, equation, of, degree, greater, than, four, in, terms, of, explicit, algebraic, operations, with, the, abel, ruffini, theorem, to, do, this, he, invented, independently, of, galois, a, branch, of, mathematics, known, as, group, theory, which, is, invaluable, not, only, in, many, areas, of, mathematics, but, for, much, of, physics, as, well, abel, sent, a, paper, on, the, unsolvability, of, the, quintic, equation, to, carl, friedrich, gauss, who, proceeded, to, discard, without, a, glance, what, he, believed, to, be, the, worthless, work, of, a, crank, as, a, 16, year, old, abel, gave, a, rigorous, proof, of, the, binomial, theorem, valid, for, all, numbers, extending, euler, s, result, which, had, held, only, for, rationals, abel, wrote, a, fundamental, work, on, the, theory, of, elliptic, integrals, containing, the, foundations, of, the, theory, of, elliptic, functions, while, travelling, to, paris, he, published, a, paper, revealing, the, double, periodicity, of, elliptic, functions, which, adrien, marie, legendre, later, described, to, augustin, louis, cauchy, as, a, monument, more, lasting, than, bronze, borrowing, a, famous, sentence, by, the, roman, poet, horatius, the, paper, was, however, misplaced, by, cauchy, while, abroad, abel, had, sent, most, of, his, work, to, berlin, to, be, published, in, the, crelle, s, journal, but, he, had, saved, what, he, regarded, as, his, most, important, work, for, the, french, academy, of, sciences, a, theorem, on, addition, of, algebraic, differentials, the, theorem, was, put, aside, and, forgotten, until, his, death, while, in, freiberg, abel, did, research, in, the, theory, of, functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and, a, new, class, now, known, as, abelian, functions, in, 1823, abel, wrote, a, paper, titled, a, general, representation, of, the, possibility, to, integrate, all, differential, formulas, norwegian, en, alminnelig, fremstilling, af, muligheten, at, integrere, alle, mulige, differential, formler, he, applied, for, funds, at, the, university, to, publish, it, however, the, work, was, lost, while, being, reviewed, never, to, be, found, thereafter, abel, said, famously, of, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, writing, style, he, is, like, the, fox, who, effaces, his, tracks, in, the, sand, with, his, tail, gauss, replied, to, him, by, saying, no, self, respecting, architect, leaves, the, scaffolding, in, place, after, completing, his, building, under, abel, s, guidance, the, prevailing, obscurities, of, analysis, began, to, be, cleared, new, fields, were, entered, upon, and, the, study, of, functions, so, advanced, as, to, provide, mathematicians, with, numerous, ramifications, along, which, progress, could, be, made, his, works, the, greater, part, of, which, originally, appeared, in, crelle, s, journal, were, edited, by, bernt, michael, holmboe, and, published, in, 1839, by, the, norwegian, government, and, a, more, complete, edition, by, ludwig, sylow, and, sophus, lie, was, published, in, 1881, the, adjective, abelian, derived, from, his, name, has, become, so, commonplace, in, mathematical, writing, that, it, is, conventionally, spelled, with, a, lower, case, initial, a, e, g, abelian, group, abelian, category, and, abelian, variety, on, 6, april, 1929, four, norwegian, stamps, were, issued, for, the, centenary, of, abel, s, death, his, portrait, appears, on, the, 500, kroner, banknote, version, v, issued, during, 1978, 1985, on, 5, june, 2002, four, norwegian, stamps, were, issued, in, honour, of, abel, two, months, before, the, bicentenary, of, his, birth, there, is, also, a, 20, kroner, coin, issued, by, norway, in, his, honour, a, statue, of, abel, stands, in, oslo, and, crater, abel, on, the, moon, was, named, after, him, in, 2002, the, abel, prize, was, established, in, his, memory, mathematician, felix, klein, wrote, about, abel, but, i, would, not, like, to, part, from, this, ideal, type, of, researcher, such, as, has, seldom, appeared, in, the, history, of, mathematics, without, evoking, a, figure, from, another, sphere, who, in, spite, of, his, totally, different, field, still, seems, related, thus, although, abel, shared, with, many, mathematicians, a, complete, lack, of, musical, talent, i, will, not, sound, absurd, if, i, compare, his, kind, of, productivity, and, his, personality, with, mozart, s, thus, one, might, erect, a, monument, to, this, divinely, inspired, mathematician, like, the, one, to, mozart, in, vienna, simple, and, unassuming, he, stands, there, listening, while, graceful, angels, float, about, playfully, bringing, him, inspiration, from, another, world, instead, i, must, mention, the, very, different, type, of, memorial, that, was, in, fact, erected, to, abel, in, christiania, and, which, must, greatly, disappoint, anyone, familiar, with, his, nature, on, a, towering, steep, block, of, granite, a, youthful, athlete, of, the, byronic, type, steps, over, two, greyish, sacrificial, victims, his, direction, toward, the, heavens, if, needed, be, one, might, take, the, hero, to, be, a, symbol, of, the, human, spirit, but, one, ponders, the, deeper, significance, of, the, two, monsters, in, vain, are, they, the, conquered, quintic, equations, or, elliptic, functions, or, the, sorrows, and, cares, of, his, everyday, life, the, pedestal, of, the, monument, bears, in, immense, letters, the, inscription, abel
