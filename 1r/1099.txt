this, forced, the, chinese, to, use, any, available, ships, including, river, boats, most, importantly, the, chinese, under, kublai, s, control, built, many, ships, quickly, in, order, to, contribute, to, the, fleets, in, both, of, the, invasions, hayashida, theorizes, that, had, kublai, used, standard, well, constructed, ocean, going, ships, with, curved, keels, to, prevent, capsizing, his, navy, might, have, survived, the, journey, to, and, from, japan, and, might, have, conquered, it, as, intended, in, october, 2011, a, wreck, possibly, one, of, kublai, s, invasion, craft, was, found, off,

to, his, and, mongol, prestige, of, the, first, two, defeats, and, only, his, death, and, the, unanimous, agreement, of, his, advisers, not, to, invade, prevented, a, third, attempt, kublai, khan,
