early, leader, of, the, 1791, war, for, freedom, in, saint, domingue, initially, allied, with, the, spaniards, of, neighboring, santo, domingo, louverture, switched, his, allegiance, to, the, french, when, the, new, republican, government, abolished, slavery, louverture, gradually, established, control, over, the, whole, island, and, used, his, political, and, military, influence, to, gain, dominance, over, his, rivals, throughout, his, years, in, power, he, worked, to, balance, the, economy, and, security, of, saint, domingue, worried, about, the, economy, which, had, stalled, he, restored, the, plantation, system, using, paid, labor, negotiated, trade, agreements, with, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, and, maintained, a, large, and, well, trained, army, louverture, seized, power, in, saint, domingue, established, his, own, system, of, government, and, promulgated, his, own, colonial, constitution, in, 1801, that, named, him, as, governor, general, for, life, which, challenged, napoleon, bonaparte, s, authority, in, 1802, he, was, invited, to, a, parley, by, french, divisional, general, jean, baptiste, brunet, but, was, arrested, upon, his, arrival, he, was, deported, to, france, and, jailed, at, the, fort, de, joux, he, died, in, 1803, although, louverture, died, before, the, final, and, most, violent, stage, of, the, haitian, revolution, his, achievements, set, the, grounds, for, the, haitian, army, s, final, victory, suffering, massive, losses, in, multiple, battles, at, the, hands, of, the, haitian, army, and, losing, thousands, of, men, to, yellow, fever, the, french, capitulated, and, withdrew, permanently, from, saint, domingue, the, very, same, year, the, haitian, revolution, continued, under, louverture, s, lieutenant, jean, jacques, dessalines, who, declared, independence, on, 1, january, 1804, thereby, establishing, the, sovereign, state, of, haiti, louverture, was, born, into, slavery, the, eldest, son, of, hyppolite, an, allada, slave, from, the, slave, coast, of, west, africa, and, his, second, wife, pauline, a, slave, from, the, aja, ethnic, group, and, given, the, name, toussaint, at, birth, louverture, s, son, issac, would, later, name, his, great, grandfather, hyppolite, s, father, as, gaou, guinou, and, a, son, of, the, king, of, allada, although, there, is, little, extant, evidence, of, this, the, name, gaou, possibly, originated, in, the, title, deguenon, meaning, old, man, or, wise, man, in, the, allada, kingdom, making, gaou, guinou, and, his, son, hyppolite, members, of, the, bureaucracy, or, nobility, but, not, members, of, the, royal, family, in, africa, hyppolite, and, his, first, wife, catherine, were, forced, into, enslavement, due, to, a, series, of, imperialist, wars, of, expansion, by, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, into, the, allada, territory, in, order, to, remove, their, political, rivals, and, obtain, european, trade, goods, dahomean, slavers, separated, the, couple, and, sold, them, to, the, crew, of, the, french, slave, ship, hermione, which, then, sailed, to, the, french, west, indies, the, original, names, of, toussaint, s, parents, are, unknown, since, the, code, noir, mandated, that, slaves, brought, to, their, colonies, be, made, into, catholics, stripped, of, their, african, names, and, be, given, more, european, names, in, order, to, assimilate, them, into, the, french, plantation, system, toussaint, s, father, received, the, name, hyppolite, upon, his, baptism, on, saint, domingue, as, latin, and, greek, names, were, the, most, fashionable, for, slaves, at, this, time, followed, by, french, and, biblical, christian, names, louverture, is, thought, to, have, been, born, on, the, plantation, of, br, da, at, haut, du, cap, in, saint, domingue, where, his, parents, were, enslaved, and, where, he, would, spend, the, majority, of, his, life, before, the, revolution, his, parents, would, go, on, to, have, several, children, after, him, with, five, surviving, infancy, marie, jean, paul, pierre, jean, and, gaou, named, for, his, grandfather, louverture, would, grow, closest, to, his, younger, brother, paul, who, along, with, his, other, siblings, were, baptized, into, the, catholic, church, by, the, local, jesuit, order, pierre, baptiste, simon, a, carpenter, and, gatekeeper, on, the, br, da, plantation, is, considered, to, have, been, louverture, s, godfather, and, went, on, to, become, a, parental, figure, to, louverture, s, family, along, with, his, foster, mother, pelage, after, the, death, of, toussaint, s, parents, growing, up, toussaint, first, learned, to, speak, the, african, fon, language, of, the, allada, slaves, on, the, plantation, then, the, creole, french, of, the, greater, colony, and, eventually, the, standard, french, of, the, elite, class, grands, blancs, during, the, revolution, although, he, would, later, become, known, for, his, stamina, and, riding, prowess, louverture, earned, the, nickname, fatras, b, ton, sickly, stick, in, reference, to, his, small, thin, stature, in, his, youth, 26, 27, toussaint, and, his, siblings, were, trained, to, be, domestic, servants, with, louverture, being, trained, as, an, equestrian, and, coachmen, after, showing, a, talent, for, handling, the, horses, and, oxen, on, the, plantation, this, allowed, the, siblings, to, work, in, the, manor, house, and, stables, away, from, the, grueling, physical, labor, and, deadly, corporal, punishment, meted, out, in, the, sugar, cane, fields, in, spite, of, this, relative, privilege, there, is, evidence, that, even, in, his, youth, louverture, s, pride, pushed, him, to, engage, in, fights, with, members, of, the, petits, blancs, white, commoner, community, who, worked, on, the, plantation, as, hired, help, there, is, a, record, that, louverture, beat, a, young, petit, blanc, named, ferere, but, was, able, to, escape, punishment, after, being, protected, by, the, new, plantation, overseer, fran, ois, antoine, bayon, de, libertat, de, libertat, had, become, steward, of, the, br, da, property, after, it, was, inherited, by, pantal, on, de, br, da, jr, a, grand, blanc, white, nobleman, and, managed, by, br, da, s, nephew, the, count, of, noah, in, spite, or, perhaps, because, of, this, protection, louverture, went, on, to, engage, in, other, fights, on, one, occasion, he, threw, the, plantation, attorney, berg, off, a, horse, belonging, to, the, br, da, plantation, when, he, attempted, to, take, it, outside, the, bounds, of, the, property, without, permission, until, 1938, historians, believed, that, louverture, had, been, a, slave, until, the, start, of, the, revolution, in, the, later, 20th, century, discovery, of, a, personal, marriage, certificate, and, baptismal, record, dated, between, 1776, and, 1777, documented, that, louverture, was, a, freeman, meaning, that, he, had, been, manumitted, sometime, between, 1772, and, 1776, the, time, de, libertat, had, become, overseer, this, finding, retrospectively, clarified, a, private, letter, that, louverture, sent, to, the, french, government, in, 1797, in, which, he, mentioned, he, had, been, free, for, more, than, twenty, years, 62, upon, being, freed, toussaint, took, up, the, name, of, toussaint, de, br, da, toussaint, of, br, da, or, more, simply, toussaint, br, da, in, reference, to, the, plantation, where, he, grew, up, toussaint, went, from, being, a, slave, of, the, br, da, plantation, to, becoming, a, member, of, the, greater, community, of, gens, de, couleur, libres, free, people, of, color, this, was, a, diverse, group, of, affranchis, freed, slaves, free, blacks, of, full, or, majority, african, ancestry, and, mulattos, mixed, race, peoples, which, included, the, children, of, french, planters, and, their, african, slaves, as, well, as, distinct, multiracial, families, who, had, multi, generational, mixed, ancestries, from, the, varying, different, populations, on, the, island, the, gens, de, couleur, libres, strongly, identified, with, saint, domingue, with, a, popular, slogan, being, that, while, the, french, felt, at, home, in, france, and, the, slaves, felt, at, home, in, africa, they, felt, at, home, on, the, island, now, enjoying, a, greater, degree, of, relative, freedom, louverture, dedicated, himself, to, building, wealth, and, gaining, further, social, mobility, through, emulating, the, model, of, the, grands, blancs, and, rich, gens, de, couleur, libres, by, becoming, a, planter, he, began, by, renting, a, small, coffee, plantation, along, with, its, 13, slaves, from, his, future, son, in, law, one, of, the, slaves, louverture, owned, at, this, time, is, believed, to, have, been, jean, jacques, dessalines, who, would, go, onto, become, one, of, louverture, s, most, loyal, lieutenants, and, a, member, of, his, personal, guard, during, the, haitian, revolution, between, 1761, and, 1777, louverture, met, and, married, his, first, wife, c, cile, in, a, catholic, ceremony, the, couple, went, on, to, have, two, sons, toussaint, jr, and, gabrielle, toussaint, and, a, daughter, marie, marthe, during, this, time, louverture, bought, several, slaves, although, this, was, a, means, to, grow, a, greater, pool, of, exploitable, labor, this, was, one, of, the, few, legal, methods, available, to, free, the, remaining, members, of, a, former, slave, s, extended, family, and, social, circle, louverture, eventually, bought, the, freedom, of, c, cile, their, children, his, sister, marie, jean, his, wife, s, siblings, and, a, slave, named, jean, baptist, freeing, him, so, that, he, could, legally, marry, louverture, s, own, marriage, however, soon, became, strained, and, eventually, broke, down, as, his, coffee, plantation, failed, to, make, adequate, returns, a, few, years, later, the, newly, freed, c, cile, left, louverture, for, a, wealthy, creole, planter, while, louverture, had, begun, a, relationship, with, a, woman, named, suzanne, who, is, believed, to, have, gone, on, to, become, his, second, wife, there, is, little, evidence, that, any, formal, divorce, occurred, as, that, was, illegal, at, the, time, louverture, in, fact, would, go, on, to, completely, excise, his, first, marriage, from, his, recollections, of, his, pre, revolutionary, life, to, the, extent, that, until, recent, documents, uncovered, the, marriage, few, researchers, were, aware, of, the, existence, of, c, cile, and, her, children, with, louverture, in, 1782, louverture, married, his, second, wife, suzanne, simone, baptiste, who, is, thought, to, have, been, his, cousin, or, the, daughter, of, his, godfather, pierre, baptiste, 263, toward, the, end, of, his, life, louverture, told, general, caffarelli, that, he, had, fathered, at, least, 16, children, of, whom, 11, had, predeceased, him, between, his, two, wives, and, a, series, of, mistresses, 264, 267, in, 1785, louverture, s, eldest, child, the, 24, year, old, toussaint, jr, died, from, a, fever, and, the, family, organized, a, formal, catholic, funeral, for, him, this, was, officiated, by, a, local, priest, as, a, favor, for, the, devout, louverture, gabrielle, toussaint, disappeared, from, the, historical, record, at, this, time, and, is, presumed, to, have, also, died, possibly, from, the, same, illness, that, took, toussaint, jr, not, all, of, louverture, s, children, can, be, identified, with, certainty, but, the, three, children, from, his, first, marriage, and, his, three, sons, from, his, second, marriage, are, well, known, suzanne, s, eldest, child, placide, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, fathered, by, seraphim, le, clerc, a, creole, planter, in, spite, of, this, placide, was, adopted, by, louverture, and, raised, as, his, own, louverture, went, on, to, have, at, least, two, sons, with, suzanne, isaac, born, in, 1784, and, saint, jean, born, in, 1791, they, would, remain, enslaved, until, the, start, of, the, revolution, as, louverture, spent, the, 1780s, attempting, to, regain, the, wealth, he, had, lost, with, the, failure, of, his, coffee, plantation, in, the, 1770s, 264, 267, it, appears, that, during, this, time, louverture, returned, to, play, an, important, role, on, the, br, da, plantation, to, remain, closer, to, old, friends, and, his, family, he, remained, there, until, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, as, a, salaried, employee, and, contributed, to, the, daily, functions, of, the, plantation, he, took, up, his, old, responsibilities, of, looking, after, the, livestock, and, care, of, the, horses, by, 1789, his, responsibilities, expanded, to, include, acting, as, a, muleteer, master, miller, and, possibly, a, slave, driver, charged, with, organizing, the, workforce, during, this, time, the, br, da, family, attempted, to, divide, the, plantation, and, the, slaves, on, it, among, a, new, series, of, four, heirs, in, an, attempt, to, protect, his, foster, mother, pelage, louverture, bought, a, young, 22, year, old, female, slave, and, traded, her, to, the, br, das, to, prevent, pelage, from, being, sold, to, a, new, owner, by, the, start, of, the, revolution, louverture, began, to, accumulate, a, moderate, fortune, and, was, able, to, buy, a, small, plot, of, land, adjacent, to, the, br, da, property, to, build, a, house, for, his, family, he, was, nearly, 48, years, old, at, this, time, louverture, gained, some, education, from, his, godfather, pierre, baptiste, on, the, br, da, plantation, his, extant, letters, demonstrate, a, moderate, familiarity, with, epictetus, the, stoic, philosopher, who, had, lived, as, a, slave, while, his, public, speeches, showed, a, familiarity, with, machiavelli, some, cite, enlightenment, thinker, abb, raynal, a, french, critic, of, slavery, and, his, publication, histoire, des, deux, indes, predicting, a, slave, revolt, in, the, west, indies, as, a, possible, influence, 30, 36, louverture, received, a, degree, of, theological, education, from, the, jesuit, and, capuchin, missionaries, through, his, church, attendance, and, devout, catholicism, his, medical, knowledge, is, attributed, to, a, familiarity, with, the, folk, medicine, of, the, african, plantation, slaves, and, creole, communities, as, well, as, more, formal, techniques, found, in, the, hospitals, founded, by, the, jesuits, and, the, free, people, of, color, legal, documents, signed, on, louverture, s, behalf, between, 1778, and, 1781, suggest, that, he, could, not, yet, write, at, that, time, 61, 67, throughout, his, military, and, political, career, during, the, revolution, he, was, known, to, have, verbally, dictated, his, letters, to, his, secretaries, who, prepared, most, of, his, correspondences, a, few, surviving, documents, from, the, end, of, his, life, in, his, own, hand, confirm, that, he, eventually, learned, to, write, although, his, standard, french, spelling, was, strictly, phonetic, and, closer, to, the, creole, french, he, spoke, for, the, majority, of, his, life, beginning, in, 1789, the, black, and, mulatto, population, of, saint, domingue, became, inspired, by, a, multitude, of, factors, that, converged, on, the, island, in, the, late, 1780s, and, early, 1790s, leading, them, to, organize, a, series, of, rebellions, against, the, central, white, colonial, assembly, in, le, cap, in, 1789, two, mix, race, creole, merchants, vincent, og, and, julien, raimond, happened, to, be, in, france, during, the, early, stages, of, the, french, revolution, here, they, began, lobbying, the, french, national, assembly, to, expand, voting, rights, and, legal, protections, from, the, grands, blancs, to, the, wealthy, slave, owning, gens, de, couleur, such, as, themselves, being, of, majority, white, descent, and, with, og, having, been, educated, in, france, the, two, were, incensed, that, their, black, african, ancestry, prevented, them, from, having, the, same, legal, rights, as, their, fathers, who, were, both, grand, blanc, planters, rebuffed, by, the, assembly, they, returned, to, the, colony, where, og, met, up, with, jean, baptiste, chavannes, a, wealthy, mixed, race, veteran, of, the, american, revolution, and, an, abolitionist, here, the, two, organized, a, small, scale, revolt, in, 1790, composed, of, a, few, hundred, gens, de, couleur, who, engaged, in, several, battles, against, the, colonial, militias, on, the, island, however, after, the, movement, failed, to, gain, traction, og, and, chavannes, were, quickly, captured, and, publicly, broken, on, the, wheel, in, the, public, square, in, le, cap, in, february, 1791, for, the, slaves, on, the, island, worsening, conditions, due, to, the, neglect, of, legal, protections, afforded, them, by, the, code, noir, stirred, animosities, and, made, a, revolt, more, attractive, compared, to, the, continued, exploitation, by, the, grands, and, petits, blancs, then, the, political, and, social, disability, caused, by, the, french, revolution, s, attempt, to, expand, the, rights, to, all, men, inspired, a, series, of, revolts, across, several, neighboring, french, possessions, in, the, caribbean, which, upset, much, of, the, established, trade, between, the, colonies, many, of, the, devout, catholic, slaves, and, freedmen, including, toussaint, identified, as, free, frenchmen, and, royalists, who, desired, to, protect, a, series, of, progressive, legal, protections, afforded, to, the, black, citizenry, by, king, louis, xvi, and, his, predecessors, on, 14, august, 1791, two, hundred, members, of, the, black, and, mixed, race, population, made, up, of, slave, foremen, creoles, and, freed, slaves, gathered, in, secret, at, a, plantation, in, morne, rouge, in, the, north, of, saint, domingue, to, plan, their, revolt, here, prominent, early, figures, of, the, revolution, such, as, dutty, fran, ois, boukman, jean, fran, ois, papillon, georges, biassou, jeannot, bullet, and, toussaint, gathered, to, nominate, a, single, leader, to, guide, the, revolt, toussaint, wary, of, the, dangers, of, taking, on, such, a, public, role, especially, after, hearing, about, what, happened, to, og, and, chavannes, went, on, to, nominate, georges, biassou, as, leader, he, would, later, join, his, forces, as, a, secretary, and, lieutenant, and, be, in, command, of, a, small, detachment, of, soldiers, during, this, time, toussaint, took, up, the, name, of, monsieur, toussaint, a, title, that, was, once, been, reserved, for, the, white, population, of, saint, domingue, surviving, documents, show, him, participating, in, the, leadership, of, the, rebellion, discussing, strategy, and, negotiating, with, the, spanish, supporters, of, the, rebellion, for, supplies, wanting, to, identify, with, the, royalist, cause, louverture, and, other, rebels, wore, white, cockades, upon, their, sleeves, and, crosses, of, st, louis, a, few, days, after, this, gathering, a, vodou, ceremony, at, bois, ca, man, marked, the, public, start, of, the, major, slave, rebellion, in, the, north, which, had, the, largest, plantations, and, enslaved, population, louverture, did, not, openly, take, part, in, the, earliest, stages, of, the, rebellion, as, he, spent, the, next, few, weeks, sending, his, family, to, safety, in, santo, domingo, and, helping, his, old, overseer, bayon, de, libertat, louverture, hid, him, and, his, family, in, a, nearby, wood, and, brought, them, food, from, a, nearby, rebel, camp, he, eventually, helped, bayon, de, libertat, s, family, escape, the, island, and, in, the, coming, years, supported, them, financially, as, they, resettled, in, the, united, states, and, mainland, france, in, 1791, louverture, was, involved, in, negotiations, between, rebel, leaders, and, the, french, governor, blanchelande, for, the, release, of, their, white, prisoners, and, a, return, to, work, in, exchange, for, a, ban, on, the, use, of, whips, an, extra, non, working, day, per, week, and, the, freedom, of, imprisoned, leaders, when, the, offer, was, rejected, he, was, instrumental, in, preventing, the, massacre, of, biassou, s, white, prisoners, the, prisoners, were, released, after, further, negotiations, and, escorted, to, le, cap, by, louverture, he, hoped, to, use, the, occasion, to, present, the, rebellion, s, demands, to, the, colonial, assembly, but, they, refused, to, meet, throughout, 1792, as, a, leader, in, an, increasingly, formal, alliance, between, the, black, rebellion, and, the, spanish, louverture, ran, the, fortified, post, of, la, tannerie, and, maintained, the, cordon, de, l, ouest, a, line, of, posts, between, rebel, and, colonial, territory, he, gained, a, reputation, for, his, discipline, training, his, men, in, guerrilla, tactics, and, the, european, style, of, war, louverture, emphasized, brotherhood, and, fraternity, among, his, troops, and, aimed, to, unify, individuals, of, many, populations, he, used, republican, rhetoric, to, rally, the, varying, groups, within, saint, dominigue, and, was, successful, in, this, effort, his, favor, of, fraternity, and, strict, discipline, defined, the, kind, of, leader, he, was, after, hard, fighting, he, lost, la, tannerie, in, january, 1793, to, the, french, general, tienne, maynaud, de, bizefranc, de, laveaux, but, it, was, in, these, battles, that, the, french, first, recognized, him, as, a, significant, military, leader, some, time, in, 1792, 1793, toussaint, adopted, the, surname, louverture, from, the, french, word, for, opening, or, the, one, who, opened, the, way, although, some, modern, writers, spell, his, adopted, surname, with, an, apostrophe, as, in, l, ouverture, he, did, not, the, most, common, explanation, is, that, it, refers, to, his, ability, to, create, openings, in, battle, the, name, is, sometimes, attributed, to, french, commissioner, polverel, s, exclamation, that, man, makes, an, opening, everywhere, some, writers, think, the, name, referred, to, a, gap, between, his, front, teeth, despite, adhering, to, royalist, views, louverture, began, to, use, the, language, of, freedom, and, equality, associated, with, the, french, revolution, from, being, willing, to, bargain, for, better, conditions, of, slavery, late, in, 1791, he, had, become, committed, to, its, complete, abolition, after, an, offer, of, land, privileges, and, recognizing, the, freedom, of, slave, soldiers, and, their, families, jean, fran, ois, and, biassou, formally, allied, with, the, spanish, in, may, 1793, louverture, likely, did, so, in, early, june, he, had, made, covert, overtures, to, general, laveaux, prior, but, was, rebuffed, as, louverture, s, conditions, for, alliance, were, deemed, unacceptable, at, this, time, the, republicans, were, yet, to, make, any, formal, offer, to, the, slaves, in, arms, and, conditions, for, the, blacks, under, the, spanish, looked, better, than, that, of, the, french, in, response, to, the, civil, commissioners, radical, 20, june, proclamation, not, a, general, emancipation, but, an, offer, of, freedom, to, male, slaves, who, agreed, to, fight, for, them, louverture, stated, that, the, blacks, wanted, to, serve, under, a, king, and, the, spanish, king, offered, his, protection, on, 29, august, 1793, he, made, his, famous, declaration, of, camp, turel, to, the, black, population, of, st, domingue, brothers, and, friends, i, am, toussaint, louverture, perhaps, my, name, has, made, itself, known, to, you, i, have, undertaken, vengeance, i, want, liberty, and, equality, to, reign, in, st, domingue, i, am, working, to, make, that, happen, unite, yourselves, to, us, brothers, and, fight, with, us, for, the, same, cause, on, the, same, day, the, beleaguered, french, commissioner, l, ger, f, licit, sonthonax, proclaimed, emancipation, for, all, slaves, in, french, saint, domingue, hoping, to, bring, the, black, troops, over, to, his, side, initially, this, failed, perhaps, because, louverture, and, the, other, leaders, knew, that, sonthonax, was, exceeding, his, authority, however, on, 4, february, 1794, the, french, revolutionary, government, in, france, proclaimed, the, abolition, of, slavery, for, months, louverture, had, been, in, diplomatic, contact, with, the, french, general, tienne, maynaud, de, bizefranc, de, laveaux, during, this, time, his, competition, with, the, other, rebel, leaders, was, growing, and, the, spanish, had, started, to, look, with, disfavor, on, his, near, autonomous, control, of, a, large, and, strategically, important, region, louverture, s, auxiliary, force, was, employed, to, great, success, with, his, army, responsible, for, half, of, all, spanish, gains, north, of, the, artibonite, in, the, west, in, addition, to, capturing, the, port, town, of, gona, ves, in, december, 1793, however, tensions, had, emerged, between, louverture, and, the, spanish, higher, ups, his, superior, with, whom, he, enjoyed, good, relations, mat, as, de, armona, was, replaced, with, juan, de, lleonart, who, was, disliked, by, the, black, auxiliaries, lleonart, failed, to, support, louverture, in, march, 1794, during, his, feud, with, biassou, who, had, been, stealing, supplies, for, louverture, s, men, and, selling, their, families, as, slaves, unlike, jean, fran, ois, and, bissaou, louverture, refused, to, round, up, enslaved, women, and, children, to, sell, to, the, spanish, this, feud, also, emphasized, louverture, s, inferior, position, in, the, trio, of, black, generals, in, the, minds, of, the, spanish, a, check, upon, any, ambitions, for, further, promotion, on, 29, april, 1794, the, spanish, garrison, at, gona, ves, was, suddenly, attacked, by, black, troops, fighting, in, the, name, of, the, king, of, the, french, who, demanded, that, the, garrison, surrender, approximately, 150, men, were, killed, and, much, of, the, populace, forced, to, flee, white, guardsmen, in, the, surrounding, area, had, been, murdered, and, spanish, patrols, sent, into, the, area, never, returned, louverture, is, suspected, to, have, been, behind, this, attack, although, was, not, present, he, wrote, to, the, spanish, 5, may, protesting, his, innocence, supported, by, the, spanish, commander, of, the, gona, ves, garrison, who, noted, that, his, signature, was, absent, from, the, rebels, ultimatum, it, was, not, until, 18, may, that, louverture, would, claim, responsibility, for, the, attack, when, he, was, fighting, under, the, banner, of, the, french, the, events, at, gona, ves, made, lleonart, increasingly, suspicious, of, louverture, when, they, had, met, at, his, camp, 23, april, the, black, general, had, shown, up, with, 150, armed, and, mounted, men, as, opposed, to, the, usual, 25, choosing, not, to, announce, his, arrival, or, waiting, for, permission, to, enter, lleonart, found, him, lacking, his, usual, modesty, or, submission, and, after, accepting, an, invitation, to, dinner, 29, april, louverture, afterward, failed, to, show, the, limp, that, had, confined, him, to, his, bed, during, the, gona, ves, attack, was, thought, to, be, feigned, and, lleonart, suspected, him, of, treachery, remaining, distrustful, of, the, black, commander, lleonart, housed, his, wife, and, children, whilst, louverture, led, an, attack, on, dondon, in, early, may, an, act, which, lleonart, later, believed, confirmed, louverture, s, decision, to, turn, against, the, spanish, the, timing, of, and, motivation, behind, louverture, s, volte, face, against, spain, remains, debated, among, historians, c, l, r, james, claimed, that, upon, learning, of, the, emancipation, decree, in, may, 1794, louverture, decided, to, join, the, french, in, june, it, is, argued, by, beaubrun, ardouin, that, toussaint, was, indifferent, toward, black, freedom, concerned, primarily, for, his, own, safety, and, resentful, over, his, treatment, by, the, spanish, leading, him, to, officially, join, the, french, on, 4, may, 1794, when, he, raised, the, republican, flag, over, gona, ves, thomas, ott, sees, louverture, as, both, a, power, seeker, and, sincere, abolitionist, who, was, working, with, laveaux, since, january, 1794, and, switched, sides, on, 6, may, louverture, claimed, to, have, switched, sides, after, emancipation, was, proclaimed, and, the, commissioners, sonthonax, and, polverel, had, returned, to, france, in, june, 1794, however, a, letter, from, toussaint, to, general, laveaux, confirms, that, he, was, already, fighting, officially, on, the, behalf, of, the, french, by, 18, may, 1794, in, the, first, weeks, louverture, eradicated, all, spanish, supporters, from, the, cordon, de, l, ouest, which, he, had, held, on, their, behalf, he, faced, attack, from, multiple, sides, his, former, colleagues, in, the, slave, rebellion, were, now, fighting, against, him, for, the, spanish, as, a, french, commander, he, was, faced, with, british, troops, who, had, landed, on, saint, domingue, in, september, as, the, british, hoped, to, take, advantage, of, the, ongoing, instability, to, capture, the, prosperous, island, henry, dundas, 1st, viscount, melville, who, was, secretary, of, state, for, war, for, british, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, instructed, sir, adam, williamson, the, lieutenant, governor, of, jamaica, to, sign, an, agreement, with, representatives, of, the, french, colonists, that, promised, to, restore, the, ancien, regime, slavery, and, discrimination, against, mixed, race, colonists, a, move, that, drew, criticism, from, abolitionists, william, wilberforce, and, thomas, clarkson, on, the, other, hand, louverture, was, able, to, pool, his, 4, 000, men, with, laveaux, s, troops, in, joint, actions, by, now, his, officers, included, men, who, were, to, remain, important, throughout, the, revolution, his, brother, paul, his, nephew, mo, se, hyacinthe, jean, jacques, dessalines, and, henri, christophe, before, long, louverture, had, put, an, end, to, the, spanish, threat, to, french, saint, domingue, in, any, case, the, treaty, of, basel, of, july, 1795, marked, a, formal, end, to, hostilities, between, the, two, countries, black, leaders, jean, fran, ois, and, biassou, continued, to, fight, against, louverture, until, november, when, they, left, for, spain, and, florida, respectively, at, that, point, most, of, their, men, joined, louverture, s, forces, louverture, also, made, inroads, against, the, british, presence, but, was, unable, to, oust, them, from, saint, marc, he, contained, them, by, resorting, to, guerilla, tactics, throughout, 1795, and, 1796, louverture, was, also, concerned, with, re, establishing, agriculture, and, exports, and, keeping, the, peace, in, areas, under, his, control, in, speeches, and, policy, he, revealed, his, belief, that, the, long, term, freedom, of, the, people, of, saint, domingue, depended, on, the, economic, viability, of, the, colony, he, was, held, in, general, respect, and, resorted, to, a, mixture, of, diplomacy, and, force, to, return, the, field, hands, to, the, plantations, as, emancipated, and, paid, workers, workers, regularly, staged, small, rebellions, protesting, poor, working, conditions, their, lack, of, real, freedom, or, their, fear, of, a, return, to, slavery, they, wanted, to, establish, their, own, small, holdings, and, work, for, themselves, rather, than, on, plantations, another, of, louverture, s, concerns, was, to, manage, potential, rivals, for, power, within, the, french, part, of, the, colony, the, most, serious, of, these, was, the, mulatto, commander, jean, louis, villatte, based, in, cap, fran, ais, louverture, and, villate, had, competed, over, the, command, of, some, sections, of, troops, and, territory, since, 1794, villatte, was, thought, to, be, somewhat, racist, toward, black, soldiers, such, as, louverture, and, planned, to, ally, with, andr, rigaud, a, free, man, of, color, after, overthrowing, french, general, tienne, laveaux, in, 1796, villate, drummed, up, popular, support, by, accusing, the, french, authorities, of, plotting, a, return, to, slavery, on, 20, march, he, succeeded, in, capturing, the, french, governor, laveaux, and, appointed, himself, governor, louverture, s, troops, soon, arrived, at, cap, fran, ais, to, rescue, the, captured, governor, and, to, drive, villatte, out, of, town, louverture, was, noted, for, opening, the, warehouses, to, the, public, proving, that, they, were, empty, of, the, chains, that, residents, feared, had, been, imported, to, prepare, for, a, return, to, slavery, he, was, promoted, to, commander, of, the, west, province, two, months, later, and, in, 1797, was, appointed, as, saint, domingue, s, top, ranking, officer, laveaux, proclaimed, louverture, as, lieutenant, governor, announcing, at, the, same, time, that, he, would, do, nothing, without, his, approval, to, which, louverture, replied, after, god, laveaux, a, few, weeks, after, louverture, s, triumph, over, the, villate, insurrection, france, s, representatives, of, the, third, commission, arrived, in, saint, domingue, among, them, was, sonthonax, the, commissioner, who, had, previously, declared, abolition, of, slavery, on, the, same, day, as, louverture, s, proclamation, of, camp, turel, at, first, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, was, positive, sonthonax, promoted, louverture, to, general, and, arranged, for, his, sons, placide, and, isaac, who, were, eleven, and, fourteen, respectively, to, attend, a, school, in, mainland, france, for, the, children, of, colonial, officials, this, was, done, to, provide, them, with, a, formal, education, in, the, french, language, and, culture, one, that, louverture, highly, desired, for, his, children, but, to, also, use, them, as, political, hostages, against, louverture, should, he, act, against, the, will, of, the, central, french, authority, in, paris, in, spite, of, this, placide, and, isaac, ran, away, enough, times, from, the, school, that, they, were, moved, to, the, coll, ge, de, la, marche, a, division, of, the, old, university, of, paris, here, in, paris, they, would, regularly, dine, with, members, of, the, french, nobility, such, as, jos, phine, de, beauharnais, who, would, go, on, to, become, empress, of, france, as, the, wife, of, napoleon, bonaparte, in, september, 1796, elections, were, held, to, choose, colonial, representatives, for, the, french, national, assembly, louverture, s, letters, show, that, he, encouraged, laveaux, to, stand, and, historians, have, speculated, as, to, whether, he, was, seeking, to, place, a, firm, supporter, in, france, or, to, remove, a, rival, in, power, sonthonax, was, also, elected, either, at, louverture, s, instigation, or, on, his, own, initiative, while, laveaux, left, saint, domingue, in, october, sonthonax, remained, sonthonax, a, fervent, revolutionary, and, fierce, supporter, of, racial, equality, soon, rivaled, louverture, in, popularity, although, their, goals, were, similar, they, had, several, points, of, conflict, while, louverture, was, quoted, as, saying, that, i, am, black, but, i, have, the, soul, of, a, white, man, in, reference, to, his, self, identification, as, a, frenchman, loyalty, to, the, french, nation, and, catholicism, sonthonax, who, had, married, a, free, black, woman, by, this, time, countered, with, i, am, white, but, i, have, the, soul, of, a, black, man, in, reference, to, his, strong, abolitionist, and, secular, republican, sentiments, they, strongly, disagreed, about, accepting, the, return, of, the, white, planters, who, had, fled, saint, domingue, at, the, start, of, the, revolution, to, the, ideologically, motivated, sonthonax, they, were, potential, counter, revolutionaries, who, had, fled, the, liberating, force, of, the, french, revolution, and, were, forbidden, from, returning, to, the, colony, under, pain, of, death, louverture, on, the, other, hand, saw, them, as, wealth, generators, who, could, restore, the, commercial, viability, of, the, colony, the, planters, political, and, familial, connections, to, metropolitan, france, could, also, foster, better, diplomatic, and, economic, ties, to, europe, in, summer, 1797, louverture, authorized, the, return, of, bayon, de, libertat, the, former, overseer, of, the, br, da, plantation, with, whom, he, had, shared, a, close, relationship, with, ever, since, he, was, enslaved, sonthonax, wrote, to, louverture, threatening, him, with, prosecution, and, ordering, him, to, get, de, libertat, off, the, island, louverture, went, over, his, head, and, wrote, to, the, french, directoire, directly, for, permission, for, de, libertat, to, stay, only, a, few, weeks, later, he, began, arranging, for, sonthonax, s, return, to, france, that, summer, louverture, had, several, reasons, to, want, to, get, rid, of, sonthonax, officially, he, said, that, sonthonax, had, tried, to, involve, him, in, a, plot, to, make, saint, domingue, independent, starting, with, a, massacre, of, the, whites, of, the, island, the, accusation, played, on, sonthonax, s, political, radicalism, and, known, hatred, of, the, aristocratic, grands, blancs, but, historians, have, varied, as, to, how, credible, they, consider, it, on, reaching, france, sonthonax, countered, by, accusing, louverture, of, royalist, counter, revolutionary, and, pro, independence, tendencies, louverture, knew, that, he, had, asserted, his, authority, to, such, an, extent, that, the, french, government, might, well, suspect, him, of, seeking, independence, at, the, same, time, the, french, directoire, government, was, considerably, less, revolutionary, than, it, had, been, suspicions, began, to, brew, that, it, might, reconsider, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, november, 1797, louverture, wrote, again, to, the, directoire, assuring, them, of, his, loyalty, but, reminding, them, firmly, that, abolition, must, be, maintained, for, months, louverture, was, in, sole, command, of, french, saint, domingue, except, for, a, semi, autonomous, state, in, the, south, where, general, andr, rigaud, had, rejected, the, authority, of, the, third, commission, both, generals, continued, harassing, the, british, whose, position, on, saint, domingue, was, increasingly, weak, louverture, was, negotiating, their, withdrawal, when, france, s, latest, commissioner, gabriel, h, douville, arrived, in, march, 1798, with, orders, to, undermine, his, authority, nearing, the, end, of, the, revolution, louverture, grew, substantially, wealthy, owning, numerous, slaves, at, ennery, obtaining, thirty, one, properties, and, earning, almost, 300, 000, colonial, livre, per, year, from, these, properties, as, leader, of, the, revolution, this, accumulated, wealth, made, louverture, the, richest, person, on, saint, domingue, louverture, s, actions, evoked, a, collective, sense, of, worry, among, the, european, powers, and, the, us, who, feared, that, the, success, of, the, revolution, would, inspire, slave, revolts, across, the, caribbean, the, south, american, colonies, and, the, southern, united, states, on, 30, april, 1798, louverture, signed, a, treaty, with, british, army, officer, thomas, maitland, exchanging, the, withdrawal, of, british, troops, from, western, saint, domingue, in, return, for, a, general, amnesty, for, the, french, counter, revolutionaries, in, those, areas, in, may, port, au, prince, was, returned, to, french, rule, in, an, atmosphere, of, order, and, celebration, in, july, louverture, and, rigaud, met, commissioner, h, douville, together, hoping, to, create, a, rivalry, that, would, diminish, louverture, s, power, h, douville, displayed, a, strong, preference, for, rigaud, and, an, aversion, to, louverture, however, general, maitland, was, also, playing, on, french, rivalries, and, evaded, h, douville, s, authority, to, deal, with, louverture, directly, in, august, louverture, and, maitland, signed, treaties, for, the, evacuation, of, all, remaining, british, troops, in, saint, dominigue, on, 31, august, they, signed, a, secret, treaty, that, lifted, the, british, royal, navy, s, blockade, on, saint, domingue, in, exchange, for, a, promise, that, louverture, would, not, attempt, to, cause, unrest, in, the, british, west, indies, as, louverture, s, relationship, with, h, douville, reached, the, breaking, point, an, uprising, began, among, the, troops, of, his, adopted, nephew, hyacinthe, mo, se, attempts, by, h, douville, to, manage, the, situation, made, matters, worse, and, louverture, declined, to, help, him, as, the, rebellion, grew, to, a, full, scale, insurrection, h, douville, prepared, to, leave, the, island, while, louverture, and, dessalines, threatened, to, arrest, him, as, a, troublemaker, h, douville, sailed, for, france, in, october, 1798, nominally, transferring, his, authority, to, rigaud, louverture, decided, instead, to, work, with, phillipe, roume, a, member, of, the, third, commission, who, had, been, posted, to, the, spanish, parts, of, the, colony, although, louverture, continued, to, protest, his, loyalty, to, the, french, government, he, had, expelled, a, second, government, representative, from, the, territory, and, was, about, to, negotiate, another, autonomous, agreement, with, one, of, france, s, enemies, the, united, states, had, suspended, trade, with, france, in, 1798, because, of, increasing, tensions, between, the, american, and, french, governments, over, the, issue, of, privateering, the, two, countries, entered, into, the, so, called, quasi, war, but, trade, between, saint, domingue, and, the, united, states, was, desirable, to, both, louverture, and, the, united, states, with, h, douville, gone, louverture, sent, diplomat, joseph, bunel, a, grand, blanc, former, planter, married, to, a, black, haitian, wife, to, negotiate, with, the, administration, of, john, adams, adams, as, a, new, englander, who, was, openly, hostile, to, slavery, was, much, more, sympathetic, to, the, haitian, cause, than, the, washington, administration, before, and, jefferson, after, both, of, whom, came, from, southern, slave, owning, planter, backgrounds, the, terms, of, the, treaty, were, similar, to, those, already, established, with, the, british, but, louverture, continually, rebuffed, suggestions, from, either, power, that, he, should, declare, independence, as, long, as, france, maintained, the, abolition, of, slavery, he, appeared, to, be, content, to, have, the, colony, remain, french, at, least, in, name, in, 1799, the, tensions, between, louverture, and, rigaud, came, to, a, head, louverture, accused, rigaud, of, trying, to, assassinate, him, to, gain, power, over, saint, domingue, rigaud, claimed, louverture, was, conspiring, with, the, british, to, restore, slavery, the, conflict, was, complicated, by, racial, overtones, that, escalated, tensions, between, full, blacks, and, mulattoes, louverture, had, other, political, reasons, for, eliminating, rigaud, only, by, controlling, every, port, could, he, hope, to, prevent, a, landing, of, french, troops, if, necessary, after, rigaud, sent, troops, to, seize, the, border, towns, of, petit, goave, and, grand, goave, in, june, 1799, louverture, persuaded, roume, to, declare, rigaud, a, traitor, and, attacked, the, southern, state, the, resulting, civil, war, known, as, the, war, of, knives, lasted, more, than, a, year, with, the, defeated, rigaud, fleeing, to, guadeloupe, then, france, in, august, 1800, louverture, delegated, most, of, the, campaign, to, his, lieutenant, jean, jacques, dessalines, who, became, infamous, during, and, after, the, war, for, massacring, mulatto, captives, and, civilians, the, number, of, deaths, is, contested, the, contemporary, french, general, fran, ois, joseph, pamphile, de, lacroix, suggested, 10, 000, deaths, while, the, 20th, century, trinidadian, historian, c, l, r, james, claimed, there, were, only, a, few, hundred, deaths, in, november, 1799, during, the, civil, war, napoleon, bonaparte, gained, power, in, france, and, passed, a, new, constitution, declaring, that, french, colonies, would, be, subject, to, special, laws, although, many, black, people, in, the, colonies, suspected, this, meant, the, re, introduction, of, slavery, napoleon, began, by, confirming, louverture, s, position, and, promising, to, maintain, existing, anti, slavery, laws, but, he, also, forbade, louverture, to, invade, spanish, santo, domingo, an, action, that, would, put, louverture, in, a, powerful, defensive, position, louverture, was, determined, to, proceed, anyway, and, coerced, roume, into, supplying, the, necessary, permission, at, the, same, time, in, order, to, improve, his, political, relationships, with, other, european, powers, louverture, tooks, steps, to, stabilize, the, political, landscape, of, the, caribbean, which, included, limiting, his, anti, slavery, sentiments, in, the, interest, of, realpolitik, when, isaac, yeshurun, sasportas, a, sephardic, jewish, merchant, from, saint, dominigue, attempted, to, travel, to, the, british, colony, of, jamaica, to, foment, a, slave, rebellion, there, louverture, initially, supported, him, however, as, he, decided, he, needed, britain, s, support, louverture, subsequently, leaked, sasportas, intentions, to, the, british, authorities, in, jamaica, who, arrested, and, hung, him, in, kingston, on, december, 23, 1799, in, january, 1801, louverture, and, his, nephew, general, hyacinthe, mo, se, invaded, the, spanish, territory, taking, possession, of, it, from, the, governor, don, garcia, with, few, difficulties, the, area, had, been, less, developed, and, populated, than, the, french, section, louverture, brought, it, under, french, law, abolishing, slavery, and, embarking, on, a, program, of, modernization, he, now, controlled, the, entire, island, napoleon, had, informed, the, inhabitants, of, saint, domingue, that, france, would, draw, up, a, new, constitution, for, its, colonies, in, which, they, would, be, subjected, to, special, laws, despite, his, protestations, to, the, contrary, the, former, slaves, feared, that, he, might, restore, slavery, in, march, 1801, louverture, appointed, a, constitutional, assembly, composed, chiefly, of, white, planters, to, draft, a, constitution, for, saint, domingue, he, promulgated, the, constitution, on, 7, july, 1801, officially, establishing, his, authority, over, the, entire, island, of, hispaniola, it, made, him, governor, general, for, life, with, near, absolute, powers, and, the, possibility, of, choosing, his, successor, however, louverture, had, not, explicitly, declared, saint, domingue, s, independence, acknowledging, in, article, 1, that, it, was, a, single, colony, of, the, french, empire, article, 3, of, the, constitution, states, there, cannot, exist, slaves, servitude, is, therein, forever, abolished, all, men, are, born, live, and, die, free, and, french, the, constitution, guaranteed, equal, opportunity, and, equal, treatment, under, the, law, for, all, races, but, confirmed, louverture, s, policies, of, forced, labor, and, the, importation, of, workers, through, the, slave, trade, identifying, as, a, loyal, christian, frenchman, louverture, was, not, willing, to, compromise, catholicism, for, vodou, the, dominant, faith, among, former, slaves, article, 6, states, that, the, catholic, apostolic, roman, faith, shall, be, the, only, publicly, professed, faith, this, strong, preference, for, catholicism, went, hand, in, hand, with, louverture, s, self, identification, of, being, a, frenchman, and, his, movement, away, from, associating, with, vodou, and, its, origins, in, the, practices, of, the, plantation, slaves, from, africa, louverture, charged, colonel, charles, humbert, marie, vincent, who, personally, opposed, the, drafted, constitution, with, the, task, of, delivering, it, to, napoleon, several, aspects, of, the, constitution, were, damaging, to, france, the, absence, of, provision, for, french, government, officials, the, lack, of, trade, advantages, and, louverture, s, breach, of, protocol, in, publishing, the, constitution, before, submitting, it, to, the, french, government, despite, his, disapproval, vincent, attempted, to, submit, the, constitution, to, napoleon, but, was, briefly, exiled, to, the, mediterranean, island, of, elba, for, his, pains, louverture, identified, as, a, frenchman, and, strove, to, convince, bonaparte, of, his, loyalty, he, wrote, to, napoleon, but, received, no, reply, napoleon, eventually, decided, to, send, an, expedition, of, 20, 000, men, to, saint, domingue, to, restore, french, authority, and, possibly, to, restore, slavery, as, well, given, the, fact, that, france, had, signed, a, temporary, truce, with, great, britain, in, the, treaty, of, amiens, napoleon, was, able, to, plan, this, operation, without, the, risk, of, his, ships, being, intercepted, by, the, royal, navy, napoleon, s, troops, under, the, command, of, his, brother, in, law, general, charles, emmanuel, leclerc, were, directed, to, seize, control, of, the, island, by, diplomatic, means, proclaiming, peaceful, intentions, and, keep, secret, his, orders, to, deport, all, black, officers, meanwhile, louverture, was, preparing, for, defense, and, ensuring, discipline, this, may, have, contributed, to, a, rebellion, against, forced, labor, led, by, his, nephew, and, top, general, mo, se, in, october, 1801, because, the, activism, was, violently, repressed, when, the, french, ships, arrived, not, all, of, saint, domingue, supported, louverture, in, late, january, 1802, while, leclerc, sought, permission, to, land, at, cap, fran, ais, and, christophe, held, him, off, the, vicomte, de, rochambeau, suddenly, attacked, fort, libert, effectively, quashing, the, diplomatic, option, christophe, had, written, to, leclerc, you, will, only, enter, the, city, of, cap, after, having, watched, it, reduced, to, ashes, and, even, upon, these, ashes, i, will, fight, you, louverture, s, plan, in, case, of, war, was, to, burn, the, coastal, cities, and, as, much, of, the, plains, as, possible, retreat, with, his, troops, into, the, inaccessible, mountains, and, wait, for, yellow, fever, to, decimate, the, french, the, biggest, impediment, to, this, plan, proved, to, be, difficulty, in, internal, communications, christophe, burned, cap, fran, ais, and, retreated, but, paul, louverture, was, tricked, by, a, false, letter, into, allowing, the, french, to, occupy, santo, domingo, other, officers, believed, napoleon, s, diplomatic, proclamation, while, some, attempted, resistance, instead, of, burning, and, retreating, with, both, sides, shocked, by, the, violence, of, the, initial, fighting, leclerc, tried, belatedly, to, revert, to, the, diplomatic, solution, louverture, s, sons, and, their, tutor, had, been, sent, from, france, to, accompany, the, expedition, with, this, end, in, mind, and, were, now, sent, to, present, napoleon, s, proclamation, to, louverture, when, these, talks, broke, down, months, of, inconclusive, fighting, followed, this, ended, when, christophe, ostensibly, convinced, that, leclerc, would, not, re, institute, slavery, switched, sides, in, return, for, retaining, his, generalship, in, the, french, military, general, jean, jacques, dessalines, did, the, same, shortly, later, on, 6, may, 1802, louverture, rode, into, cap, fran, ais, and, negotiated, an, acknowledgement, of, leclerc, s, authority, in, return, for, an, amnesty, for, him, and, his, remaining, generals, louverture, was, then, forced, to, capitulate, and, placed, under, house, arrest, on, his, property, in, ennery, jean, jacques, dessalines, was, at, least, partially, responsible, for, louverture, s, arrest, as, asserted, by, several, authors, including, louverture, s, son, isaac, on, 22, may, 1802, after, dessalines, learned, that, louverture, had, failed, to, instruct, a, local, rebel, leader, to, lay, down, his, arms, per, the, recent, ceasefire, agreement, he, immediately, wrote, to, leclerc, to, denounce, louverture, s, conduct, as, extraordinary, for, this, action, dessalines, and, his, spouse, received, gifts, from, jean, baptiste, brunet, leclerc, originally, asked, dessalines, to, arrest, louverture, but, he, declined, jean, baptiste, brunet, was, ordered, to, do, so, but, accounts, differ, as, to, how, he, accomplished, this, one, version, said, that, brunet, pretended, that, he, planned, to, settle, in, saint, domingue, and, was, asking, louverture, s, advice, about, plantation, management, louverture, s, memoirs, however, suggest, that, brunet, s, troops, had, been, provocative, leading, louverture, to, seek, a, discussion, with, him, either, way, louverture, had, a, letter, in, which, brunet, described, himself, as, a, sincere, friend, to, take, with, him, to, france, embarrassed, about, his, trickery, brunet, absented, himself, during, the, arrest, finally, on, june, 7, 1802, despite, the, promises, made, in, exchange, for, his, surrender, toussaint, louverture, as, well, as, a, hundred, members, of, his, inner, circle, were, captured, and, deported, to, france, brunet, transported, louverture, and, his, companions, on, the, frigate, cr, ole, and, the, 74, gun, h, ros, claiming, that, he, suspected, the, former, leader, of, plotting, another, uprising, upon, boarding, the, cr, ole, toussaint, louverture, warned, his, captors, that, the, rebels, would, not, repeat, his, mistake, saying, that, in, overthrowing, me, you, have, cut, down, in, saint, domingue, only, the, trunk, of, the, tree, of, liberty, it, will, spring, up, again, from, the, roots, for, they, are, numerous, and, they, are, deep, the, ships, reached, france, on, 2, july, 1802, and, on, 25, august, louverture, was, imprisoned, at, fort, de, joux, in, doubs, during, this, time, louverture, wrote, a, memoir, he, died, in, prison, on, 7, april, 1803, at, the, age, of, 59, suggested, causes, of, death, include, exhaustion, malnutrition, apoplexy, pneumonia, and, possibly, tuberculosis, throughout, his, life, louverture, was, known, as, a, devout, roman, catholic, having, been, baptized, into, the, church, as, a, slave, by, the, jesuits, louverture, would, go, on, to, be, one, of, the, few, slaves, on, the, br, da, plantation, to, be, labeled, devout, he, celebrated, mass, every, day, when, possible, regularly, served, as, godfather, at, multiple, slave, baptisms, and, constantly, quizzed, others, on, the, catechism, of, the, church, in, 1763, the, jesuits, were, expelled, for, spreading, catholicism, among, the, slaves, and, undermining, planter, propaganda, that, slaves, were, mentally, inferior, toussaint, would, grow, closer, to, the, capuchin, order, that, succeeded, them, in, 1768, especially, as, they, did, not, own, plantations, like, the, jesuits, louverture, would, also, go, on, to, have, two, formal, catholic, weddings, to, both, of, his, wives, once, freed, in, his, memoirs, he, fondly, recounted, the, weekly, ritual, his, family, had, on, sundays, of, going, to, church, and, enjoying, a, communal, meal, although, spending, most, of, his, life, as, a, member, of, the, catholic, faith, louverture, s, early, life, included, aspects, of, the, vodou, religion, vodou, was, common, among, slaves, in, saint, dominque, as, it, was, passed, down, through, black, communities, of, allada, origin, characteristics, of, the, vodou, belief, include, a, link, between, spirits, and, herbs, used, for, medicine, historian, and, author, sudhir, hazareesingh, writes, toussaint, undoubtably, made, this, connection, and, drew, upon, the, magical, recipes, of, sorcerers, in, his, practice, of, natural, medicine, louverture, was, regarded, as, a, doctor, for, some, time, during, his, travels, across, the, colony, which, aided, in, his, process, of, generating, a, following, among, those, in, saint, dominque, in, the, earlier, years, of, louverture, s, adult, life, after, defeating, forces, led, by, andr, rigaud, in, the, war, of, the, knives, louverture, consolidated, his, power, by, decreeing, a, new, constitution, for, the, colony, in, 1801, it, established, catholicism, as, the, official, religion, although, vodou, was, generally, practiced, on, saint, domingue, in, combination, with, catholicism, little, is, known, for, certain, if, louverture, had, any, connection, with, it, officially, as, ruler, of, saint, domingue, he, discouraged, its, practice, and, eventually, persecuted, its, followers, historians, have, suggested, that, he, was, a, member, of, high, degree, of, the, masonic, lodge, of, saint, domingue, mostly, based, on, a, masonic, symbol, he, used, in, his, signature, the, membership, of, several, free, blacks, and, white, men, close, to, him, have, been, confirmed, in, his, absence, jean, jacques, dessalines, led, the, haitian, rebellion, until, its, completion, finally, defeating, the, french, forces, in, 1803, two, thirds, of, the, men, had, died, when, napoleon, withdrew, his, forces, john, brown, claimed, influence, by, louverture, in, his, plans, to, invade, harpers, ferry, during, the, 19th, century, african, americans, referred, to, louverture, as, an, example, of, how, to, reach, freedom, on, 29, august, 1954, the, haitian, ambassador, to, france, l, on, th, baud, inaugurated, a, stone, cross, memorial, for, toussaint, louverture, at, the, foot, of, fort, de, joux, years, afterward, the, french, government, ceremoniously, presented, a, shovelful, of, soil, from, the, grounds, of, fort, de, joux, to, the, haitian, government, as, a, symbolic, transfer, of, louverture, s, remains, an, inscription, in, his, memory, was, installed, in, 1998, on, the, wall, of, the, panth, on, in, paris, his, desire, for, personal, power, the, expulsion, of, sonthonax, and, his, rehabilitation, of, the, white, planters, have, all, attracted, historical, criticism, the, making, of, his, legacy, was, also, in, the, notion, that, he, was, devoted, to, his, military, leadership, strategies, and, etiquette, that, was, looked, upon, with, great, attachment, to, the, officers, in, his, military, command, as, sudhir, hazareesingh, author, of, black, spartacus, says, the, absolute, dedication, toussaint, expected, of, his, soldiers, on, the, battlefield, was, more, than, exemplified, by, their, commander, he, was, the, epitome, of, the, charismatic, military, leader, a, model, of, sobriety, he, slept, only, a, few, hours, every, night, drank, no, alcohol, and, his, capacity, for, physical, endurance, was, greater, than, even, the, hardiest, of, men, hazareesingh, pg, 72, the, youngest, child, of, toussaint, and, suzanne, saint, jean, toussaint, was, affected, by, the, death, of, his, father, and, died, in, 1804, in, agen, his, wife, suzanne, underwent, torture, from, french, soldiers, until, toussaint, s, death, and, was, deported, to, jamaica, where, she, died, on, may, 19, 1816, in, the, arms, of, their, surviving, sons, placide, and, isaac, both, surviving, brothers, returned, to, france, in, 1831, placide,
