people, he, led, two, resistance, movements, against, the, government, of, canada, and, its, first, prime, minister, john, a, macdonald, riel, sought, to, defend, m, tis, rights, and, identity, as, the, northwest, territories, came, progressively, under, the, canadian, sphere, of, influence, the, first, resistance, movement, led, by, riel, was, the, red, river, resistance, of, 1869, 1870, the, provisional, government, established, by, riel, ultimately, negotiated, the, terms, under, which, the, new, province, of, manitoba, entered, the, canadian, confederation, however, while, carrying, out, the, resistance, riel, had, a, canadian, nationalist, thomas, scott, executed, riel, soon, fled, to, the, united, states, to, escape, prosecution, he, was, elected, three, times, as, member, of, the, house, of, commons, but, fearing, for, his, life, never, took, his, seat, during, these, years, in, exile, he, came, to, believe, that, he, was, a, divinely, chosen, leader, and, prophet, he, married, in, 1881, while, in, exile, in, the, montana, territory, in, 1884, riel, was, called, upon, by, the, m, tis, leaders, in, saskatchewan, to, help, resolve, longstanding, grievances, with, the,

imprisoned, in, regina, where, he, was, convicted, at, trial, of, high, treason, despite, protests, popular, appeals, and, the, jury, s, call, for, clemency, riel, was, executed, by, hanging, riel, was, seen, as, a, heroic, victim, by, french, canadians, his, execution, had, a, lasting, negative, impact, on, canada, polarizing, the, new, nation, along, ethno, religious, lines, the, m, tis, were, marginalized, in, the, prairie, provinces, by, the, increasingly, english, dominated, majority, a, long, term, effect, of, these, actions, was, the, bitter, alienation, felt, by, francophones, across, canada, and, their, anger, against, the, repression, by, their, countrymen, riel, s, historical, reputation, has, long, been, polarized, between, portrayals, as, a, dangerous, religious, fanatic, and, rebel, opposed, to, the, canadian, nation, and, by, contrast, as, a, charismatic, leader, intent, on, defending, his, m, tis, people, from, the, unfair, encroachments, by, the, federal, government, eager, to, give, orangemen, dominated, ontario, settlers, priority, access, to, land, riel, has, received, among, the, most, formal, organizational, and, academic, scrutiny, of, any, figure, in, canadian, history, the, red, river, settlement, was, a, rupert, s, land, territory, administered, by, the, hudson, s, bay, company, hbc, at, the, mid, 19th, century, the, settlement, was, largely, inhabited, by, m, tis, people, of, mixed, first, nations, european, descent, their, ancestors, were, for, the, most, part, scottish, and, english, men, married, to, cree, women, and, french, canadian, men, married, to, saulteaux, plains, ojibwe, women, louis, riel, was, born, in, 1844, in, his, grandparents, small, one, room, home, in, st, boniface, near, the, fork, of, the, red, and, seine, rivers, riel, was, the, eldest, of, eleven, children, in, a, locally, well, respected, family, his, father, who, was, of, franco, chipewyan, m, tis, descent, had, gained, prominence, in, this, community, by, organizing, a, group, that, supported, guillaume, sayer, a, m, tis, arrested, and, tried, for, challenging, the, hbc, s, historical, trade, monopoly, sayer, s, eventual, release, due, to, agitations, by, louis, sr, s, group, effectively, ended, the, monopoly, and, the, name, riel, was, therefore, well, known, in, the, red, river, area, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, jean, baptiste, lagimodi, re, and, marie, anne, gaboury, one, of, the, earliest, white, families, to, settle, in, red, river, in, 1812, the, riels, were, noted, for, their, devout, catholicism, and, strong, family, ties, riel, began, his, schooling, at, age, seven, and, by, age, ten, he, attended, st, boniface, catholic, schools, including, eventually, a, school, run, by, the, french, christian, brothers, at, age, thirteen, he, came, to, the, attention, of, bishop, alexandre, tach, who, was, eagerly, promoting, the, priesthood, for, talented, young, m, tis, in, 1858, tach, arranged, for, riel, to, attend, the, petit, s, minaire, de, montr, al, descriptions, of, him, at, the, time, indicate, that, he, was, a, fine, scholar, of, languages, science, and, philosophy, while, a, good, student, he, was, also, hot, tempered, extreme, in, his, views, intolerant, of, criticism, and, opposition, and, not, opposed, to, arguing, with, his, teachers, following, news, of, his, father, s, premature, death, in, 1864, riel, lost, interest, in, the, priesthood, and, withdrew, from, the, college, in, march, 1865, for, a, time, he, continued, his, studies, as, a, day, student, in, the, convent, of, the, grey, nuns, but, was, soon, asked, to, leave, following, breaches, of, discipline, during, riel, s, period, of, mourning, of, his, father, he, believed, that, louis, riel, was, dead, and, he, himself, was, david, mordecai, a, jew, from, marseilles, and, as, david, he, was, not, eligible, to, the, immense, inheritance, of, his, father, which, in, fact, was, of, little, value, seized, with, religious, fervour, he, announced, that, he, was, going, to, form, a, new, religious, movement, he, remained, in, montreal, for, over, a, year, living, at, the, home, of, his, aunt, lucie, riel, impoverished, by, the, death, of, his, father, riel, took, employment, as, a, law, clerk, in, the, montreal, office, of, rodolphe, laflamme, during, this, time, he, was, involved, in, a, failed, romance, with, a, young, woman, named, marie, julie, guernon, this, progressed, to, the, point, of, riel, having, signed, a, contract, of, marriage, but, his, fianc, e, s, family, opposed, her, involvement, with, a, m, tis, and, the, engagement, was, soon, broken, compounding, this, disappointment, riel, found, legal, work, unpleasant, and, by, early, 1866, he, had, resolved, to, leave, canada, east, some, of, his, friends, said, later, that, he, worked, odd, jobs, in, chicago, while, staying, with, poet, louis, honor, fr, chette, and, wrote, poems, himself, in, the, manner, of, lamartine, and, that, he, was, briefly, employed, as, a, clerk, in, saint, paul, minnesota, before, returning, to, the, red, river, settlement, on, 26, july, 1868, the, majority, population, of, the, red, river, had, historically, been, m, tis, and, first, nations, people, upon, his, return, riel, found, that, religious, nationalistic, and, racial, tensions, were, exacerbated, by, an, influx, of, anglophone, protestant, settlers, from, ontario, the, political, situation, was, also, uncertain, as, ongoing, negotiations, for, the, transfer, of, rupert, s, land, from, the, hudson, s, bay, company, to, canada, had, not, addressed, the, political, terms, of, transfer, bishop, tach, and, the, hbc, governor, william, mactavish, both, warned, the, macdonald, government, that, the, lack, of, consultation, and, consideration, of, m, tis, views, would, precipitate, unrest, finally, the, canadian, minister, of, public, works, william, mcdougall, ordered, a, survey, of, the, area, the, arrival, of, a, survey, party, on, 20, august, 1869, increased, anxiety, among, the, m, tis, as, the, survey, was, being, carried, out, as, a, grid, system, of, townships, an, american, system, that, cut, across, existing, m, tis, river, lots, in, late, august, riel, denounced, the, survey, in, a, speech, and, on, 11, october, 1869, the, survey, s, work, was, disrupted, by, a, group, of, m, tis, that, included, riel, this, group, organized, itself, as, the, national, committee, of, the, m, tis, on, 16, october, with, riel, as, secretary, and, john, bruce, as, president, when, summoned, by, the, hbc, controlled, council, of, assiniboia, to, explain, his, actions, riel, declared, that, any, attempt, by, canada, to, assume, authority, would, be, contested, unless, ottawa, had, first, negotiated, terms, with, the, m, tis, nevertheless, the, non, bilingual, mcdougall, was, appointed, the, lieutenant, governor, designate, and, attempted, to, enter, the, settlement, on, 2, november, mcdougall, s, party, was, turned, back, near, the, canada, us, border, and, on, the, same, day, m, tis, led, by, riel, seized, fort, garry, on, 6, november, riel, invited, anglophones, to, attend, a, convention, alongside, m, tis, representatives, to, discuss, a, course, of, action, and, on, 1, december, he, proposed, to, this, convention, a, list, of, rights, to, be, demanded, as, a, condition, of, union, much, of, the, settlement, came, to, accept, the, m, tis, point, of, view, but, a, passionately, pro, canadian, minority, began, organizing, in, opposition, loosely, constituted, as, the, canadian, party, this, group, was, led, by, john, christian, schultz, charles, mair, colonel, john, stoughton, dennis, and, a, more, reticent, major, charles, boulton, mcdougall, attempted, to, assert, his, authority, by, authorizing, dennis, to, raise, a, contingent, of, armed, men, but, the, anglophone, settlers, largely, ignored, this, call, to, arms, schultz, however, attracted, approximately, fifty, recruits, and, fortified, his, home, and, store, riel, ordered, schultz, s, home, surrounded, and, the, outnumbered, canadians, soon, surrendered, and, were, imprisoned, in, upper, fort, garry, hearing, of, the, unrest, ottawa, sent, three, emissaries, to, the, red, river, including, hbc, representative, donald, alexander, smith, while, they, were, en, route, the, m, tis, national, committee, declared, a, provisional, government, on, 8, december, with, riel, becoming, its, president, on, 27, december, meetings, between, riel, and, the, ottawa, delegation, took, place, on, 5, and, 6, january, 1870, when, these, proved, fruitless, smith, chose, to, present, his, case, in, a, public, forum, after, large, meetings, on, 19, and, 20, january, riel, suggested, the, formation, of, a, new, convention, split, evenly, between, francophone, and, anglophone, settlers, to, consider, smith, s, proposals, on, 7, february, a, new, list, of, rights, was, presented, to, the, ottawa, delegation, and, smith, and, riel, agreed, to, send, representatives, to, ottawa, to, engage, in, direct, negotiations, on, that, basis, the, provisional, government, established, by, louis, riel, published, its, own, newspaper, titled, new, nation, and, established, the, legislative, assembly, of, assiniboia, to, pass, laws, the, legislative, assembly, of, assiniboia, was, the, first, elected, government, at, the, red, river, settlement, and, functioned, from, 9, march, to, 24, june, 1870, the, assembly, had, 28, elected, representatives, including, a, president, louis, riel, an, executive, council, government, cabinet, adjutant, general, chief, of, military, staff, chief, justice, and, clerk, despite, the, progress, on, the, political, front, the, canadian, party, continued, to, plot, against, the, provisional, government, they, attempted, to, recruit, supporters, to, overthrow, riel, however, they, suffered, a, setback, on, 17, february, when, forty, eight, men, including, boulton, and, thomas, scott, were, arrested, near, fort, garry, boulton, was, tried, by, a, tribunal, headed, by, ambroise, dydime, l, pine, and, sentenced, to, death, for, his, interference, with, the, provisional, government, he, was, pardoned, but, scott, interpreted, this, as, weakness, by, the, m, tis, who, he, regarded, with, open, contempt, after, scott, repeatedly, quarreled, with, his, guards, they, insisted, that, he, be, tried, for, insubordination, at, his, court, martial, he, was, found, guilty, and, was, sentenced, to, death, riel, was, repeatedly, entreated, to, commute, the, sentence, but, riel, responded, i, have, done, three, good, things, since, i, have, commenced, i, have, spared, boulton, s, life, at, your, instance, i, pardoned, gaddy, and, now, i, shall, shoot, scott, scott, was, soon, executed, by, a, m, tis, firing, squad, on, 4, march, riel, s, motivations, have, been, the, cause, of, much, speculation, but, his, justification, was, that, he, felt, it, necessary, to, demonstrate, to, the, canadians, that, the, m, tis, must, be, taken, seriously, protestant, canada, did, take, notice, swore, revenge, and, set, up, a, canada, first, movement, to, mobilize, their, anger, riel, biographer, lewis, thomas, noted, that, as, people, then, and, later, have, said, it, was, riel, s, one, great, political, blunder, the, delegates, representing, the, provisional, government, arrived, in, ottawa, in, april, although, they, initially, met, with, legal, difficulties, arising, from, the, execution, of, scott, they, soon, entered, into, direct, talks, with, macdonald, and, george, tienne, cartier, the, parties, agreed, on, several, of, the, demands, in, the, list, of, rights, including, language, religious, and, land, rights, excepting, ownership, of, public, lands, this, agreement, formed, the, basis, for, the, manitoba, act, which, formally, admitted, manitoba, into, the, canadian, confederation, the, legislative, assembly, of, assiniboia, unanimously, supported, joining, however, the, negotiators, could, not, secure, a, general, amnesty, for, the, provisional, government, cartier, held, that, this, was, a, question, for, the, british, government, as, a, means, of, exercising, canadian, authority, in, the, settlement, and, dissuading, american, expansionists, a, canadian, military, expedition, under, colonel, garnet, wolseley, was, dispatched, to, the, red, river, although, the, government, described, it, as, an, errand, of, peace, riel, learned, that, canadian, militia, elements, in, the, expedition, meant, to, lynch, him, it, was, not, until, 2, september, 1870, that, the, new, lieutenant, governor, adams, george, archibald, arrived, and, set, about, the, establishment, of, civil, government, without, an, amnesty, and, with, the, canadian, militia, threatening, his, life, riel, fled, to, the, safety, of, the, st, joseph, s, mission, across, the, canada, us, border, in, the, dakota, territory, the, results, of, the, first, provincial, election, in, december, 1870, were, promising, for, riel, as, many, of, his, supporters, came, to, power, nevertheless, stress, and, financial, troubles, precipitated, a, serious, illness, perhaps, a, harbinger, of, his, future, mental, afflictions, that, prevented, his, return, to, manitoba, until, may, 1871, the, settlement, now, faced, a, possible, threat, from, cross, border, fenian, raids, coordinated, by, his, former, associate, william, bernard, o, donoghue, archibald, issued, a, call, to, arms, in, october, and, assured, riel, that, if, he, participated, he, would, not, be, arrested, riel, organized, several, companies, of, m, tis, troops, for, the, defense, of, manitoba, when, archibald, reviewed, the, troops, in, st, boniface, he, made, the, significant, gesture, of, publicly, shaking, riel, s, hand, signaling, that, a, rapprochement, had, been, effected, when, this, news, reached, ontario, mair, and, members, of, the, canada, first, movement, whipped, up, anti, riel, and, anti, archibald, sentiment, with, federal, elections, coming, in, 1872, macdonald, could, ill, afford, further, rift, in, quebec, ontario, relations, and, so, he, did, not, offer, an, amnesty, instead, he, quietly, arranged, for, tach, to, offer, riel, a, bribe, of, c, 1, 000, to, remain, in, voluntary, exile, this, was, supplemented, by, an, additional, 600, from, smith, for, the, care, of, riel, s, family, nevertheless, by, late, june, riel, was, back, in, manitoba, and, was, soon, persuaded, to, run, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, the, electoral, district, of, provencher, however, following, the, early, september, defeat, of, george, tienne, cartier, in, his, home, riding, in, quebec, riel, stood, aside, so, that, cartier, on, record, as, being, in, favour, of, amnesty, for, riel, might, secure, a, seat, in, provencher, cartier, won, by, acclamation, but, riel, s, hopes, for, a, swift, resolution, to, the, amnesty, question, were, dashed, following, cartier, s, death, on, 20, may, 1873, in, the, ensuing, by, election, in, october, 1873, riel, ran, unopposed, as, an, independent, although, he, had, again, fled, a, warrant, having, been, issued, for, his, arrest, in, september, l, pine, was, not, so, lucky, he, was, captured, and, faced, trial, riel, made, his, way, to, montreal, and, fearing, arrest, or, assassination, vacillated, as, to, whether, he, should, attempt, to, take, up, his, seat, in, the, house, of, commons, edward, blake, the, premier, of, ontario, had, announced, a, bounty, of, 5, 000, for, his, arrest, riel, was, the, only, member, of, parliament, who, was, not, present, for, the, great, pacific, scandal, debate, of, 1873, that, led, to, the, resignation, of, the, macdonald, government, in, november, liberal, leader, alexander, mackenzie, became, the, interim, prime, minister, and, a, general, election, was, held, in, january, 1874, although, the, liberals, under, mackenzie, formed, the, new, government, riel, easily, retained, his, seat, formally, riel, had, to, sign, a, register, book, at, least, once, upon, being, elected, and, he, did, so, under, disguise, in, late, january, he, was, nevertheless, stricken, from, the, rolls, following, a, motion, supported, by, schultz, who, had, become, the, member, for, the, electoral, district, of, lisgar, riel, prevailed, again, in, the, resulting, by, election, and, was, again, expelled, during, this, period, riel, had, been, staying, with, the, oblate, fathers, in, plattsburgh, new, york, who, introduced, him, to, parish, priest, fabien, martin, dit, barnab, in, the, nearby, village, of, keeseville, it, was, here, that, he, received, news, of, l, pine, s, fate, following, his, trial, for, the, murder, of, scott, which, had, begun, on, 13, october, 1874, l, pine, was, found, guilty, and, sentenced, to, death, this, sparked, outrage, in, the, sympathetic, quebec, press, and, calls, for, amnesty, for, both, l, pine, and, riel, were, renewed, this, presented, a, severe, political, difficulty, for, mackenzie, who, was, hopelessly, caught, between, the, demands, of, quebec, and, ontario, however, a, solution, was, forthcoming, when, acting, on, his, own, initiative, the, governor, general, lord, dufferin, commuted, l, pine, s, sentence, in, january, 1875, this, opened, the, door, for, mackenzie, to, secure, from, parliament, an, amnesty, for, riel, on, the, condition, that, he, remain, in, exile, for, five, years, during, his, time, of, exile, riel, was, primarily, concerned, with, religion, rather, than, politics, much, of, these, emerging, religious, beliefs, were, based, on, a, supportive, letter, dated, 14, july, 1875, that, he, received, from, montreal, s, bishop, ignace, bourget, his, mental, state, deteriorated, and, following, a, violent, outburst, he, was, taken, to, montreal, where, he, was, under, the, care, of, his, uncle, john, lee, for, a, few, months, but, after, riel, disrupted, a, religious, service, lee, arranged, to, have, him, committed, in, an, asylum, in, longue, pointe, on, 6, march, 1876, under, the, assumed, name, louis, r, david, fearing, discovery, his, doctors, soon, transferred, him, to, the, beauport, asylum, near, quebec, city, under, the, name, louis, larochelle, while, he, suffered, from, sporadic, irrational, outbursts, he, continued, his, religious, writing, composing, theological, tracts, with, an, admixture, of, christian, and, judaic, ideas, he, consequently, began, calling, himself, louis, david, riel, prophet, infallible, pontiff, and, priest, king, nevertheless, he, slowly, recovered, and, was, released, from, the, asylum, on, 23, january, 1878, with, an, admonition, to, lead, a, quiet, life, he, returned, for, a, time, to, keeseville, where, he, became, involved, in, a, passionate, romance, with, evelina, martin, dite, barnab, sister, of, father, fabien, he, asked, her, to, marry, him, before, moving, west, with, the, avowed, intention, of, establishing, himself, before, sending, for, her, however, their, correspondence, ended, abruptly, in, the, fall, of, 1878, riel, returned, to, st, paul, and, briefly, visited, his, friends, and, family, this, was, a, time, of, rapid, change, for, the, m, tis, of, the, red, river, the, bison, on, which, they, depended, were, becoming, increasingly, scarce, the, influx, of, settlers, was, ever, increasing, and, much, land, was, sold, to, unscrupulous, land, speculators, like, other, red, river, m, tis, who, had, left, manitoba, riel, headed, further, west, to, start, a, new, life, travelling, to, the, montana, territory, he, became, a, trader, and, interpreter, in, the, area, surrounding, fort, benton, observing, the, detrimental, impact, of, alcohol, on, the, m, tis, he, engaged, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, curtail, the, whisky, trade, in, pointe, au, loup, fort, berthold, dakota, territory, in, 1881, he, married, the, young, m, tis, marguerite, monet, dite, bellehumeur, according, to, the, custom, of, the, country, la, fa, on, du, pays, on, 28, april, the, marriage, being, solemnized, on, 9, march, 1882, evelina, learned, of, this, marriage, from, a, newspaper, and, wrote, a, letter, accusing, riel, of, infamy, marguerite, and, louis, were, to, have, three, children, jean, louis, 1882, 1908, marie, ang, lique, 1883, 1897, and, a, boy, who, was, born, and, died, on, 21, october, 1885, less, than, one, month, before, riel, was, hanged, riel, soon, became, involved, in, the, politics, of, montana, and, in, 1882, actively, campaigned, on, behalf, of, the, republican, party, he, brought, a, suit, against, a, democrat, for, rigging, a, vote, but, was, then, himself, accused, of, fraudulently, inducing, british, subjects, to, take, part, in, the, election, in, response, riel, applied, for, united, states, citizenship, and, was, naturalized, on, 16, march, 1883, with, two, young, children, he, had, by, 1884, settled, down, and, was, teaching, school, at, the, st, peter, s, jesuit, mission, in, the, sun, river, district, of, montana, following, the, red, river, resistance, m, tis, travelled, west, and, settled, in, the, saskatchewan, valley, but, by, the, 1880s, the, rapid, collapse, of, the, buffalo, herd, was, causing, near, starvation, among, the, first, nations, this, was, exacerbated, by, a, reduction, in, government, assistance, and, by, a, general, failure, of, ottawa, to, live, up, to, its, treaty, obligations, the, m, tis, were, likewise, obliged, to, give, up, the, hunt, and, take, up, agriculture, but, this, transition, was, accompanied, by, complex, issues, surrounding, land, claims, similar, to, those, that, had, previously, arisen, in, manitoba, moreover, settlers, from, europe, and, the, eastern, provinces, were, also, moving, into, the, saskatchewan, territories, and, they, too, had, complaints, related, to, the, administration, of, the, territories, virtually, all, parties, therefore, had, grievances, and, by, 1884, anglophone, settlers, anglo, m, tis, and, m, tis, communities, were, holding, meetings, and, petitioning, a, largely, unresponsive, government, for, redress, in, the, electoral, district, of, lorne, a, meeting, of, the, south, branch, m, tis, was, held, in, the, village, of, batoche, on, 24, march, and, representatives, voted, to, ask, riel, to, return, and, represent, their, cause, on, 6, may, a, joint, settler, s, union, meeting, was, attended, by, both, the, m, tis, and, english, speaking, representatives, from, prince, albert, including, william, henry, jackson, an, ontario, settler, sympathetic, to, the, m, tis, and, known, to, them, as, honor, jackson, and, james, isbister, of, the, anglo, m, tis, it, was, here, resolved, to, send, a, delegation, to, ask, riel, to, return, the, head, of, the, delegation, to, riel, was, gabriel, dumont, a, respected, buffalo, hunter, and, leader, of, the, saint, laurent, m, tis, who, had, known, riel, in, manitoba, james, isbister, was, the, lone, anglo, m, tis, delegate, riel, was, easily, swayed, to, support, their, cause, riel, also, intended, to, use, the, new, position, of, influence, to, pursue, his, own, land, claims, in, manitoba, upon, his, arrival, m, tis, and, anglophone, settlers, alike, formed, an, initially, favourable, impression, of, riel, following, a, series, of, speeches, in, which, he, advocated, moderation, and, a, reasoned, approach, during, june, 1884, the, plains, cree, leaders, big, bear, and, poundmaker, were, independently, formulating, their, complaints, and, subsequently, held, meetings, with, riel, however, the, native, grievances, were, quite, different, from, those, of, the, settlers, and, nothing, was, then, resolved, honor, jackson, and, representatives, of, other, communities, set, about, drafting, a, petition, to, be, sent, to, ottawa, in, the, interim, riel, s, support, began, to, waver, as, riel, s, religious, pronouncements, became, increasingly, heretical, the, clergy, distanced, themselves, and, father, alexis, andr, cautioned, riel, against, mixing, religion, and, politics, also, in, response, to, bribes, by, territorial, lieutenant, governor, and, indian, commissioner, edgar, dewdney, local, english, language, newspapers, adopted, an, editorial, stance, critical, of, riel, nevertheless, the, work, continued, and, on, 16, december, riel, forwarded, the, committee, s, petition, to, the, government, along, with, the, suggestion, that, delegates, be, sent, to, ottawa, to, engage, in, direct, negotiation, receipt, of, the, petition, was, acknowledged, by, joseph, adolphe, chapleau, macdonald, s, secretary, of, state, although, macdonald, himself, would, later, deny, having, ever, seen, it, by, then, many, original, followers, had, left, only, 250, remained, at, batoche, when, it, fell, in, may, 1885, while, riel, awaited, news, from, ottawa, he, considered, returning, to, montana, but, had, by, february, resolved, to, stay, without, a, productive, course, of, action, riel, began, to, engage, in, obsessive, prayer, and, was, experiencing, a, significant, relapse, of, his, mental, agitations, this, led, to, a, deterioration, in, his, relationship, with, the, catholic, clergy, as, he, publicly, espoused, an, increasingly, heretical, doctrine, on, 11, february, 1885, a, response, to, the, petition, was, received, the, government, proposed, to, take, a, census, of, the, north, west, territories, and, to, form, a, commission, to, investigate, grievances, this, angered, a, faction, of, the, m, tis, who, saw, it, as, a, mere, delaying, tactic, they, favoured, taking, up, arms, at, once, riel, became, the, leader, of, this, faction, but, he, lost, the, support, of, almost, all, anglophones, and, anglo, m, tis, and, the, catholic, church, he, also, lost, the, support, of, the, m, tis, faction, supporting, local, leader, charles, nolin, but, riel, undoubtedly, influenced, by, his, messianic, delusions, became, increasingly, supportive, of, this, course, of, action, disenchanted, with, the, status, quo, and, swayed, by, riel, s, charisma, and, eloquent, rhetoric, hundreds, of, m, tis, remained, loyal, to, riel, despite, his, proclamations, that, bishop, ignace, bourget, should, be, accepted, as, pope, and, that, rome, has, fallen, the, provisional, government, of, saskatchewan, was, declared, at, batoche, on, 19, march, with, riel, as, the, political, and, spiritual, leader, and, with, dumont, assuming, responsibility, for, military, affairs, riel, formed, a, council, called, the, exovedate, a, neologism, meaning, those, who, picked, from, the, flock, on, 21, march, riel, s, emissaries, demanded, that, crozier, surrender, fort, carlton, scouting, near, duck, lake, on, 26, march, a, force, led, by, gabriel, dumont, unexpectedly, chanced, upon, a, party, from, fort, carlton, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, duck, lake, the, police, were, routed, and, the, north, west, rebellion, was, begun, in, earnest, the, near, completion, of, the, canadian, pacific, railway, allowed, troops, from, eastern, canada, to, quickly, arrive, in, the, territory, knowing, that, he, could, not, defeat, the, canadians, in, direct, confrontation, dumont, had, hoped, to, force, the, canadians, to, negotiate, by, engaging, in, a, long, drawn, out, campaign, of, guerrilla, warfare, dumont, realized, a, modest, success, along, these, lines, at, the, battle, of, fish, creek, on, 24, april, 1885, riel, however, insisted, on, concentrating, forces, at, batoche, to, defend, his, city, of, god, the, outcome, of, the, ensuing, battle, of, batoche, which, took, place, from, 9, to, 12, may, was, never, in, doubt, and, on, 15, may, a, disheveled, riel, surrendered, to, canadian, forces, although, big, bear, s, forces, managed, to, hold, out, until, the, battle, of, loon, lake, on, 3, june, the, rebellion, was, a, dismal, failure, for, indigenous, communities, several, individuals, closely, tied, to, the, government, requested, that, the, trial, be, held, in, winnipeg, in, july, 1885, some, historians, contend, that, the, trial, was, moved, to, regina, because, of, concerns, with, the, possibility, of, an, ethnically, mixed, and, sympathetic, jury, prime, minister, macdonald, ordered, the, trial, to, be, convened, in, regina, where, riel, was, tried, before, a, jury, of, six, anglophone, protestants, the, trial, began, on, 20, july, 1885, riel, delivered, two, long, speeches, during, his, trial, defending, his, own, actions, and, affirming, the, rights, of, the, m, tis, people, he, rejected, his, lawyers, attempt, to, argue, that, he, was, not, guilty, by, reason, of, insanity, the, jury, found, him, guilty, but, recommended, mercy, nonetheless, judge, hugh, richardson, sentenced, him, to, death, on, 1, august, 1885, with, the, date, of, his, execution, initially, set, for, 18, september, 1885, we, tried, riel, for, treason, one, juror, later, said, and, he, was, hanged, for, the, murder, of, scott, lewis, thomas, notes, that, the, government, s, conduct, of, the, case, was, to, be, a, travesty, of, justice, boulton, writes, in, his, memoirs, that, as, the, date, of, his, execution, approached, riel, regretted, his, opposition, to, the, defence, of, insanity, and, vainly, attempted, to, provide, evidence, that, he, was, not, sane, requests, for, a, retrial, petitions, for, a, commuted, sentence, and, an, appeal, to, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, in, britain, were, denied, john, a, macdonald, who, was, instrumental, in, upholding, riel, s, sentence, is, famously, quoted, as, saying, he, shall, hang, though, every, dog, in, quebec, bark, in, his, favour, although, the, veracity, of, this, quote, is, uncertain, before, his, execution, riel, received, father, andr, as, his, spiritual, advisor, he, was, also, given, writing, materials, and, allowed, to, correspond, with, friends, and, relatives, louis, riel, was, hanged, for, treason, on, 16, november, 1885, at, the, north, west, mounted, police, barracks, in, regina, boulton, writes, of, riel, s, final, moments, p, re, andr, after, explaining, to, riel, that, the, end, was, at, hand, asked, him, if, he, was, at, peace, with, men, riel, answered, yes, the, next, question, was, do, you, forgive, all, your, enemies, yes, riel, then, asked, him, if, he, might, speak, father, andr, advised, him, not, to, do, so, he, then, received, the, kiss, of, peace, from, both, the, priests, and, father, andr, exclaimed, in, french, alors, allez, au, ciel, meaning, so, go, to, heaven, last, words, were, to, say, good, bye, to, dr, jukes, and, thank, him, for, his, kindness, and, just, before, the, white, cap, was, pulled, over, his, face, he, said, remerciez, madame, forget, meaning, thank, mrs, forget, the, cap, was, pulled, down, and, while, he, was, praying, the, trap, was, pulled, death, was, not, instantaneous, louis, riel, s, pulse, ceased, four, minutes, after, the, trap, door, fell, and, during, that, time, the, rope, around, his, neck, slowly, strangled, and, choked, him, to, death, the, body, was, to, have, been, interred, inside, the, gallows, enclosure, and, the, grave, was, commenced, but, an, order, came, from, the, lieutenant, governor, to, hand, the, body, over, to, sheriff, chapleau, which, was, accordingly, done, that, night, following, the, execution, riel, s, body, was, returned, to, his, mother, s, home, in, st, vital, where, it, lay, in, state, on, 12, december, 1886, his, remains, were, interred, in, the, churchyard, of, the, saint, boniface, cathedral, following, the, celebration, of, a, requiem, mass, the, trial, and, execution, of, riel, caused, a, bitter, and, prolonged, reaction, which, convulsed, canadian, politics, for, decades, the, execution, was, both, supported, and, opposed, by, the, provinces, for, example, conservative, ontario, strongly, supported, riel, s, execution, but, quebec, was, vehemently, opposed, to, it, francophones, were, upset, riel, was, hanged, because, they, thought, his, execution, was, a, symbol, of, anglophone, dominance, of, canada, the, orange, irish, protestant, element, in, ontario, had, demanded, the, execution, as, the, punishment, for, riel, s, treason, and, his, execution, of, thomas, scott, in, 1870, in, quebec, the, politician, honor, mercier, rose, to, power, by, mobilizing, the, opposition, in, 1886, historians, have, debated, the, riel, case, so, often, and, so, passionately, that, he, is, the, most, written, about, person, in, canadian, history, interpretations, have, varied, dramatically, over, time, the, first, amateur, english, language, histories, hailed, the, triumph, of, civilization, represented, by, english, speaking, protestants, over, savagery, represented, by, the, half, breed, m, tis, who, were, catholic, and, spoke, french, riel, was, portrayed, as, an, insane, traitor, and, an, obstacle, to, the, expansion, of, canada, to, the, west, by, the, mid, 20th, century, academic, historians, had, dropped, the, theme, of, savagery, versus, civilization, deemphasized, the, m, tis, and, focused, on, riel, presenting, his, execution, as, a, major, cause, of, the, bitter, division, in, canada, along, ethnocultural, and, geographical, lines, of, religion, and, language, w, l, morton, says, of, the, execution, that, it, convulsed, the, course, of, national, politics, for, the, next, decade, it, was, well, received, in, ontario, particularly, among, orangemen, but, francophone, quebec, defended, riel, as, the, symbol, indeed, as, a, hero, of, his, race, morton, concluded, that, some, of, riel, s, positions, were, defensible, but, that, they, did, not, present, a, program, of, practical, substance, which, the, government, might, have, granted, without, betrayal, of, its, responsibilities, j, m, bumsted, in, 2000, said, that, for, manitoba, historian, james, jackson, the, shooting, of, scott, perhaps, the, result, of, riel, s, incipient, madness, was, the, great, blemish, on, riel, s, achievement, depriving, him, of, his, proper, role, as, the, father, of, manitoba, the, catholic, clergy, had, originally, supported, the, m, tis, but, reversed, themselves, when, they, realized, that, riel, was, leading, a, heretical, movement, they, made, sure, that, he, was, not, honored, as, a, martyr, however, the, clergy, lost, their, influence, during, the, quiet, revolution, and, activists, in, quebec, found, in, riel, the, perfect, hero, with, the, image, now, of, a, freedom, fighter, who, stood, up, for, his, people, against, an, oppressive, government, in, the, face, of, widespread, racist, bigotry, he, was, made, a, folk, hero, by, m, tis, french, canadian, and, other, canadian, minorities, activists, who, espoused, violence, embraced, his, image, in, the, 1960s, the, quebec, terrorist, group, the, front, de, lib, ration, du, qu, bec, adopted, the, name, louis, riel, for, one, of, its, terrorist, cells, across, canada, there, emerged, a, new, interpretation, of, reality, in, his, rebellion, holding, that, the, m, tis, had, major, unresolved, grievances, that, the, government, was, indeed, unresponsive, that, riel, had, chosen, violence, only, as, a, last, resort, and, he, was, given, a, questionable, trial, then, executed, by, a, vengeful, government, john, foster, said, in, 1985, that, the, interpretive, drift, of, the, last, half, century, has, witnessed, increasingly, shrill, though, frequently, uncritical, condemnations, of, canadian, government, culpability, and, equally, uncritical, identification, with, the, victimization, of, the, innocent, m, tis, however, political, scientist, thomas, flanagan, reversed, his, views, after, editing, riel, s, writings, he, argued, that, the, m, tis, grievances, were, at, least, partly, of, their, own, making, that, riel, s, violent, approach, was, unnecessary, given, the, government, s, response, to, his, initial, constitutional, agitation, and, that, he, received, a, surprisingly, fair, trial, an, article, by, doug, owram, appearing, in, the, canadian, historical, review, in, 1982, found, that, riel, had, become, a, canadian, folk, hero, even, mythical, in, english, canada, corresponding, with, the, designation, of, batoche, as, a, national, historic, site, and, the, compilation, of, his, writings, that, compilation, consisted, of, three, volumes, of, letters, diaries, and, other, prose, writings, a, fourth, volume, of, his, poetry, and, a, fifth, volume, which, contained, reference, materials, edited, by, george, stanley, raymond, huel, gilles, martel, thomas, flanagan, and, glen, campbell, this, work, ma, it, possible, to, think, comprehensively, about, riel, s, life, and, his, achievements, but, was, also, criticized, for, some, of, its, editorial, decisions, in, a, 2010, speech, beverley, mclachlin, then, chief, justice, of, canada, summed, up, riel, as, being, a, rebel, by, the, standards, of, the, time, but, a, patriot, viewed, through, our, modern, lens, the, saskatchewan, m, tis, requested, land, grants, were, all, provided, by, the, government, by, the, end, of, 1887, and, the, government, resurveyed, the, m, tis, river, lots, in, accordance, with, their, wishes, however, much, of, the, land, was, soon, bought, by, speculators, who, later, turned, huge, profits, from, it, riel, s, worst, fears, were, realized, following, the, failed, rebellion, the, french, language, and, roman, catholic, religion, faced, increasing, marginalization, in, both, saskatchewan, and, manitoba, as, exemplified, by, the, controversy, surrounding, the, manitoba, schools, question, the, m, tis, themselves, were, increasingly, forced, to, live, in, shantytowns, on, undesirable, land, saskatchewan, did, not, become, a, province, until, 1905, riel, s, execution, and, macdonald, s, refusal, to, commute, his, sentence, caused, lasting, discord, in, quebec, honor, mercier, exploited, the, discontent, to, reconstitute, the, parti, national, this, party, which, promoted, quebec, nationalism, won, a, majority, in, the, 1886, quebec, election, the, federal, election, of, 1887, likewise, saw, significant, gains, by, the, federal, liberals, this, led, to, the, victory, of, the, liberal, party, under, wilfrid, laurier, in, the, federal, election, of, 1896, which, in, turn, set, the, stage, for, the, domination, of, canadian, federal, politics, particularly, in, quebec, by, the, liberal, party, in, the, 20th, century, since, the, 1980s, numerous, federal, politicians, have, introduced, private, member, s, bills, seeking, to, pardon, riel, or, recognize, him, as, a, father, of, confederation, in, 1992, the, house, of, commons, passed, a, resolution, recognizing, the, unique, and, historic, role, of, louis, riel, as, a, founder, of, manitoba, and, his, contribution, in, the, development, of, confederation, the, cbc, s, greatest, canadian, project, ranked, riel, as, the, 11th, greatest, canadian, on, the, basis, of, a, public, vote, on, 19, february, 2024, riel, was, formally, recognized, as, manitoba, s, first, premier, by, virtue, of, the, louis, riel, act, in, 2007, manitoba, s, provincial, government, voted, to, recognize, louis, riel, day, as, a, provincial, holiday, observed, on, the, third, monday, of, february, two, statues, of, riel, are, located, in, winnipeg, one, of, these, statues, the, work, of, architect, tienne, gaboury, and, sculptor, marcien, lemay, depicts, riel, as, a, naked, and, tortured, figure, it, was, unveiled, in, 1971, and, stood, in, the, grounds, of, the, manitoba, legislative, building, for, 23, years, after, much, outcry, especially, from, the, m, tis, community, that, the, statue, was, an, undignified, misrepresentation, the, statue, was, removed, and, placed, at, the, universit, de, saint, boniface, it, was, replaced, with, a, statue, of, louis, riel, designed, by, miguel, joyal, depicting, riel, as, a, dignified, statesman, the, unveiling, ceremony, was, on, 12, may, 1996, in, winnipeg, a, statue, of,
