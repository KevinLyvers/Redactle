murray, gell, mann, m, r, i, l, m, n, september, 15, 1929, may, 24, 2019, was, an, american, theoretical, physicist, who, played, a, preeminent, role, in, the, development, of, the, theory, of, elementary, particles, gell, mann, introduced, the, concept, of, quarks, as, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, the, strongly, interacting, particles, and, the, renormalization, group, as, a, foundational, element, of, quantum, field, theory, and, statistical, mechanics, he, played, key, roles, in, developing, the, concept, of, chirality, in, the, theory, of, the, weak, interactions, and, spontaneous, chiral, symmetry, breaking, in, the, strong, interactions, which, controls, the, physics, of, the, light, mesons, in, the, 1970s, he, was, a, co, inventor, of, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, which, explains, the, confinement, of, quarks, in, mesons, and, baryons, and, forms, a, large, part, of, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particles, and, forces, murray, gell, mann, received, the, 1969, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, work, on, the, theory, of, elementary, particles, gell, mann, was, born, in, lower, manhattan, to, a, family, of, jewish, immigrants, from, the, austro, hungarian, empire, specifically, from, czernowitz, in, present, day, ukraine, his, parents, were, pauline, n, e, reichstein, and, arthur, isidore, gelman, who, taught, english, as, a, second, language, propelled, by, an, intense, boyhood, curiosity, and, love, for, nature, and, mathematics, he, graduated, valedictorian, from, the, columbia, grammar, preparatory, school, aged, 14, and, subsequently, entered, yale, college, as, a, member, of, jonathan, edwards, college, at, yale, he, participated, in, the, william, lowell, putnam, mathematical, competition, and, was, on, the, team, representing, yale, university, along, with, murray, gerstenhaber, and, henry, o, pollak, that, won, the, second, prize, in, 1947, gell, mann, graduated, from, yale, with, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, physics, in, 1948, and, intended, to, pursue, graduate, studies, in, physics, he, sought, to, remain, in, the, ivy, league, for, his, graduate, education, and, applied, to, princeton, university, as, well, as, harvard, university, he, was, rejected, by, princeton, and, accepted, by, harvard, but, the, latter, institution, was, unable, to, offer, him, needed, financial, assistance, he, was, accepted, by, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, and, received, a, letter, from, victor, weisskopf, urging, him, to, attend, mit, and, become, weisskopf, s, research, assistant, this, would, provide, gell, mann, with, the, financial, assistance, he, required, unaware, of, mit, s, eminent, status, in, physics, research, gell, mann, was, miserable, with, the, fact, that, he, would, not, be, able, to, attend, princeton, or, harvard, and, in, characteristic, dark, irony, said, he, considered, suicide, gell, mann, stated, that, he, realized, he, could, try, to, first, enter, mit, and, commit, suicide, afterwards, if, he, found, it, to, be, truly, terrible, however, he, couldn, t, first, choose, suicide, and, then, attend, mit, the, two, didn, t, commute, as, gell, mann, said, he, received, his, ph, d, in, physics, from, mit, in, 1951, after, completing, a, doctoral, dissertation, titled, coupling, strength, and, nuclear, reactions, under, the, supervision, of, weisskopf, subsequently, gell, mann, was, a, postdoctoral, fellow, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, at, princeton, in, 1951, and, a, visiting, research, professor, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, from, 1952, to, 1953, he, was, a, visiting, associate, professor, at, columbia, university, and, an, associate, professor, at, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1954, 1955, before, moving, to, the, california, institute, of, technology, where, he, taught, from, 1955, until, he, retired, in, 1993, he, was, on, sabbatical, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, for, the, academic, year, 1958, 1959, gell, mann, married, j, margaret, dow, in, 1955, they, had, a, daughter, and, a, son, margaret, died, in, 1981, and, in, 1992, he, married, marcia, southwick, whose, son, became, his, stepson, in, 2011, gell, mann, attended, an, event, on, jeffrey, epstein, s, private, island, little, saint, james, known, as, the, mindshift, conference, hosted, by, epstein, and, al, seckel, gell, mann, s, extensive, interests, outside, of, physics, included, archaeology, numismatics, birdwatching, and, linguistics, along, with, s, a, starostin, he, established, the, evolution, of, human, languages, project, at, the, santa, fe, institute, as, a, humanist, and, an, agnostic, gell, mann, was, a, humanist, laureate, in, the, international, academy, of, humanism, novelist, cormac, mccarthy, saw, gell, mann, as, a, polymath, who, knew, more, things, about, more, things, than, anyone, i, ve, ever, met, losing, murray, is, like, losing, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, gell, mann, died, on, may, 24, 2019, at, his, home, in, santa, fe, new, mexico, gell, mann, was, the, robert, andrews, millikan, professor, of, theoretical, physics, emeritus, at, california, institute, of, technology, as, well, as, a, university, professor, in, the, physics, and, astronomy, department, of, the, university, of, new, mexico, in, albuquerque, new, mexico, and, the, presidential, professor, of, physics, and, medicine, at, the, university, of, southern, california, he, was, a, member, of, the, editorial, board, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, gell, mann, spent, several, periods, at, cern, a, nuclear, research, facility, in, switzerland, among, others, as, a, john, simon, guggenheim, memorial, foundation, fellow, in, 1972, in, 1984, gell, mann, was, one, of, several, co, founders, of, the, santa, fe, institute, a, non, profit, theoretical, research, institute, in, santa, fe, new, mexico, intended, to, study, various, aspects, of, a, complex, system, and, disseminate, the, notion, of, a, separate, interdisciplinary, study, of, complexity, theory, he, wrote, a, popular, science, book, about, physics, and, complexity, science, the, quark, and, the, jaguar, adventures, in, the, simple, and, the, complex, 1994, the, title, of, the, book, is, taken, from, a, line, of, a, poem, by, arthur, sze, the, world, of, the, quark, has, everything, to, do, with, a, jaguar, circling, in, the, night, the, author, george, johnson, has, written, a, biography, of, gell, mann, strange, beauty, murray, gell, mann, and, the, revolution, in, 20th, century, physics, 1999, which, was, shortlisted, for, the, royal, society, book, prize, although, gell, mann, himself, criticized, strange, beauty, for, some, inaccuracies, with, one, interviewer, reporting, him, wincing, at, the, mention, of, it, the, book, was, acclaimed, by, a, number, of, his, colleagues, a, revised, second, edition, was, published, in, 2023, by, the, santa, fe, institute, press, with, a, foreword, by, douglas, hofstadter, in, 2012, gell, mann, and, his, companion, mary, mcfadden, published, the, book, mary, mcfadden, a, lifetime, of, design, collecting, and, adventure, in, 1958, gell, mann, in, collaboration, with, richard, feynman, in, parallel, with, the, independent, team, of, e, c, george, sudarshan, and, robert, marshak, discovered, the, chiral, structures, of, the, weak, interaction, of, physics, and, developed, the, v, a, theory, vector, minus, axial, vector, theory, this, work, followed, the, experimental, discovery, of, the, violation, of, parity, by, chien, shiung, wu, as, suggested, theoretically, by, chen, ning, yang, and, tsung, dao, lee, gell, mann, s, work, in, the, 1950s, involved, recently, discovered, cosmic, ray, particles, that, came, to, be, called, kaons, and, hyperons, classifying, these, particles, led, him, to, propose, that, a, quantum, number, called, strangeness, would, be, conserved, by, the, strong, and, the, electromagnetic, interactions, but, not, by, the, weak, interaction, another, of, gell, mann, s, ideas, is, the, gell, mann, okubo, formula, which, was, initially, a, formula, based, on, empirical, results, but, was, later, explained, by, his, quark, model, gell, mann, and, abraham, pais, were, involved, in, explaining, this, puzzling, aspect, of, the, neutral, kaon, mixing, murray, gell, mann, s, fortunate, encounter, with, mathematician, richard, earl, block, at, caltech, in, the, fall, of, 1960, enlightened, him, to, introduce, a, novel, classification, scheme, in, 1961, for, hadrons, a, similar, scheme, had, been, independently, proposed, by, yuval, ne, eman, and, has, come, to, be, explained, by, the, quark, model, gell, mann, referred, to, the, scheme, as, the, eightfold, way, because, of, the, octets, of, particles, in, the, classification, the, term, is, a, reference, to, the, eightfold, path, of, buddhism, gell, mann, along, with, maurice, l, vy, developed, the, sigma, model, of, pions, which, describes, low, energy, pion, interactions, in, 1964, gell, mann, and, independently, george, zweig, went, on, to, postulate, the, existence, of, quarks, particles, which, make, up, the, hadrons, of, this, scheme, the, name, quark, was, coined, by, gell, mann, and, is, a, reference, to, the, novel, finnegans, wake, by, james, joyce, three, quarks, for, muster, mark, book, 2, episode, 4, zweig, had, referred, to, the, particles, as, aces, but, gell, mann, s, name, caught, on, quarks, antiquarks, and, gluons, were, soon, established, as, the, underlying, elementary, objects, in, the, study, of, the, structure, of, hadrons, he, was, awarded, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1969, for, his, contributions, and, discoveries, concerning, the, classification, of, elementary, particles, and, their, interactions, in, the, 1960s, he, introduced, current, algebra, as, a, method, of, systematically, exploiting, symmetries, to, extract, predictions, from, quark, models, in, the, absence, of, reliable, dynamical, theory, this, method, led, to, model, independent, sum, rules, confirmed, by, experiment, and, provided, starting, points, underpinning, the, development, of, the, standard, model, sm, the, widely, accepted, theory, of, elementary, particles, in, 1972, gell, mann, while, on, sabbatical, leave, to, cern, together, with, harald, fritzsch, heinrich, leutwyler, and, william, a, bardeen, considered, a, yang, mills, theory, of, quark, color, and, coined, the, term, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, as, the, gauge, theory, of, the, strong, interaction, the, quark, model, is, a, part, of, qcd, and, it, has, been, robust, enough, to, accommodate, in, a, natural, fashion, the, discovery, of, new, flavors, of, quarks, which, has, superseded, the, eightfold, way, scheme, gell, mann, was, responsible, with, pierre, ramond, and, richard, slansky, and, independently, of, peter, minkowski, rabindra, mohapatra, goran, senjanovi, sheldon, glashow, and, tsutomu, yanagida, for, proposing, the, seesaw, theory, of, neutrino, masses, this, produces, masses, at, the, large, scale, in, any, theory, with, a, right, handed, neutrino, he, is, also, known, to, have, played, a, role, in, keeping, string, theory, alive, through, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, supporting, that, line, of, research, at, a, time, when, it, was, a, topic, of, niche, interest, gell, mann, was, a, proponent, of, the, consistent, histories, approach, to, understanding, quantum, mechanics, which, he, advocated, in, papers, with, james, hartle, gell, mann, won, numerous, awards, and, honours, including, the, following, universities, that, gave, gell, mann, honorary, doctorates, include, cambridge, columbia, the, university, of, chicago, oxford, and, yale
