the, management, of, the, dauphin, then, a, province, in, southeastern, france, louis, s, ceaseless, intrigues, however, led, his, father, to, banish, him, from, court, from, the, dauphin, louis, led, his, own, political, establishment, and, married, charlotte, of, savoy, daughter, of, louis, duke, of, savoy, against, the, will, of, his, father, charles, vii, sent, an, army, to, compel, his, son, to, his, will, but, louis, fled, to, burgundy, where, he, was, hosted, by, philip, the, good, the, duke, of, burgundy, charles, greatest, enemy, when, charles, vii, died, in, 1461, louis, left, the, burgundian, court, to, take, possession, of, his, kingdom, his, taste, for, intrigue, and, his, intense, diplomatic, activity, earned, him, the, nicknames, the, cunning, middle, french, le, rus, and, the, universal, spider, middle, french, l, universelle, aragne, as, his, enemies, accused, him, of, spinning, webs, of, plots, and, conspiracies, in, 1472, the, subsequent, duke, of, burgundy, charles, the, bold, took, up, arms, against, his, rival, louis, however, louis, was, able, to, isolate, charles, from, his, english, allies, by, signing, the, treaty, of, picquigny, 1475, with, edward, iv, of, england, the, treaty, formally, ended, the, hundred, years, war, with, the, death, of, charles, the, bold, at, the, battle, of, nancy, in, 1477, the, dynasty, of, the, dukes, of, burgundy, died, out, louis, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, seize, numerous, burgundian, territories, including, burgundy, itself, and, picardy, without, direct, foreign, threats, louis, was, able, to, eliminate, his, rebellious, vassals, expand, royal, power, and, strengthen, the, economic, development, of, his, country, he, died, in, 1483, and, was, succeeded, by, his, minor, son, charles, viii, louis, was, born, in, bourges, on, 3, july, 1423, the, son, of, king, charles, vii, of, france, and, marie, of, anjou, at, the, time, of, the, hundred, years, war, the, english, held, northern, france, including, the, city, of, paris, and, charles, vii, was, restricted, to, the, centre, and, south, of, the, country, louis, was, the, grandson, of, yolande, of, aragon, who, was, a, force, in, the, royal, family, for, driving, the, english, out, of, france, which, was, at, a, low, point, in, its, struggles, just, a, few, weeks, after, louis, s, christening, at, the, cathedral, of, st, tienne, on, 4, july, 1423, the, french, army, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, by, the, english, at, cravant, shortly, thereafter, a, combined, anglo, burgundian, army, briefly, raided, bourges, itself, during, the, reign, of, louis, s, grandfather, charles, vi, 1380, 1422, the, duchy, of, burgundy, was, very, much, connected, with, the, french, throne, but, because, the, central, government, lacked, any, real, power, all, the, duchies, of, france, tended, to, act, independently, in, its, position, of, independence, from, the, french, throne, burgundy, had, grown, in, size, and, power, by, the, reign, of, louis, s, father, charles, vii, philip, the, good, was, reigning, as, duke, of, burgundy, and, the, duchy, had, expanded, its, borders, to, include, all, the, territory, in, france, from, the, north, sea, in, the, north, to, the, jura, mountains, in, the, south, and, from, the, somme, river, in, the, west, to, the, moselle, river, in, the, east, during, the, hundred, years, war, the, burgundians, allied, themselves, with, england, against, the, french, crown, in, 1429, young, louis, found, himself, at, loches, in, the, presence, of, joan, of, arc, fresh, from, her, first, victory, over, the, english, at, the, siege, of, orl, ans, which, initiated, a, turning, point, for, the, french, in, the, hundred, years, war, joan, later, led, troops, in, other, victories, at, the, battle, of, jargeau, and, the, battle, of, patay, paris, was, recaptured, after, her, death, and, louis, and, his, father, were, able, to, ride, in, triumph, into, the, city, on, 12, november, 1437, nevertheless, louis, grew, up, aware, of, the, continuing, weakness, of, france, he, regarded, his, father, as, a, weakling, and, despised, him, for, this, on, 24, june, 1436, louis, met, margaret, daughter, of, king, james, i, of, scotland, the, bride, his, father, had, chosen, for, diplomatic, reasons, there, are, no, direct, accounts, from, louis, or, his, young, bride, of, their, first, impressions, of, each, other, and, it, is, mere, speculation, whether, they, actually, had, negative, feelings, for, each, other, several, historians, think, that, louis, had, a, predetermined, attitude, to, hate, his, wife, but, it, is, universally, agreed, that, louis, entered, the, ceremony, and, the, marriage, itself, dutifully, as, evidenced, by, his, formal, embrace, of, margaret, upon, their, first, meeting, louis, s, marriage, with, margaret, resulted, from, the, nature, of, medieval, royal, diplomacy, and, the, precarious, position, of, the, french, monarchy, at, the, time, the, wedding, ceremony, very, plain, by, the, standards, of, the, time, took, place, in, the, chapel, of, the, castle, of, tours, on, the, afternoon, of, 25, june, 1436, and, was, presided, over, by, renaud, of, chartres, the, archbishop, of, reims, the, 13, year, old, louis, clearly, looked, more, mature, than, his, 11, year, old, bride, who, was, said, to, resemble, a, beautiful, doll, and, was, treated, as, such, by, her, in, laws, charles, wore, grey, riding, pants, and, did, not, even, bother, to, remove, his, spurs, the, scottish, guests, were, quickly, hustled, out, after, the, wedding, reception, as, the, french, royal, court, was, quite, impoverished, at, this, time, they, simply, could, not, afford, an, extravagant, ceremony, or, to, host, their, scottish, guests, for, any, longer, than, they, did, the, scots, however, saw, this, behaviour, as, an, insult, to, their, small, but, proud, country, following, the, ceremony, doctors, advised, against, consummation, because, of, the, relative, immaturity, of, the, bride, and, bridegroom, margaret, continued, her, studies, and, louis, went, on, tour, with, charles, to, loyal, areas, of, the, kingdom, even, at, this, time, charles, was, taken, aback, by, the, intelligence, and, temper, of, his, son, during, this, tour, louis, was, named, dauphin, of, france, by, charles, as, was, traditional, for, the, eldest, son, of, the, king, the, beautiful, and, cultured, margaret, was, popular, at, the, court, of, france, but, her, marriage, to, louis, was, not, a, happy, one, in, part, because, of, his, strained, relations, with, her, father, in, law, who, was, very, attached, to, her, she, died, childless, at, the, age, of, 20, in, 1445, in, 1440, louis, aged, 16, took, part, in, an, uprising, known, as, the, praguerie, which, sought, to, neutralize, charles, and, install, louis, as, regent, of, france, the, uprising, failed, and, louis, was, forced, to, submit, to, the, king, who, chose, to, forgive, him, in, this, revolt, louis, came, under, the, influence, of, charles, i, duke, of, bourbon, whose, troops, were, in, no, condition, to, mount, such, a, serious, threat, to, royal, authority, louis, was, forced, to, retreat, to, paris, but, was, by, no, means, trounced, in, fact, before, his, final, defeat, military, strength, combined, with, antipathy, of, the, masses, for, great, lords, won, him, the, support, of, the, citizens, of, paris, this, was, a, great, learning, experience, for, louis, james, cleugh, notes, like, other, strong, minded, boys, he, had, found, at, last, he, could, not, carry, all, before, him, by, mere, bluster, neither, as, prince, nor, as, king, did, he, ever, forget, his, lesson, he, never, acted, on, pure, impulse, without, reflection, though, to, his, life, s, end, he, was, constantly, tempted, to, take, such, a, risk, in, 1444, louis, led, an, army, of, corcheurs, bands, of, mercenary, soldiers, against, the, swiss, at, the, battle, of, st, jakob, an, der, birs, where, he, sought, to, reconquer, territories, of, his, future, brother, in, law, sigismund, of, austria, tyrol, he, won, only, one, victory, before, suing, for, peace, he, failed, to, achieve, his, original, objective, he, still, quarreled, with, his, father, his, objectionable, scheming, which, included, disrespectful, behavior, directed, against, his, father, s, beloved, mistress, agn, s, sorel, caused, him, to, be, ordered, out, of, court, on, 27, september, 1446, and, sent, to, his, own, province, of, dauphin, he, lived, mainly, in, grenoble, in, the, tour, de, la, tr, sorerie, despite, frequent, summons, by, the, king, the, two, would, never, meet, again, in, dauphin, louis, ruled, as, king, in, all, but, name, continuing, his, intrigues, against, his, father, on, 14, february, 1451, louis, who, had, been, widowed, for, six, years, made, a, strategic, marriage, to, the, eight, year, old, charlotte, of, savoy, without, charles, consent, this, marriage, was, to, have, long, ranging, effects, on, foreign, policy, as, the, beginning, of, french, involvement, in, the, affairs, of, the, italian, peninsula, finally, in, august, 1456, charles, sent, an, army, to, dauphin, under, the, command, of, antoine, de, chabannes, louis, fled, to, burgundy, where, he, was, granted, refuge, by, duke, philip, the, good, and, settled, in, the, castle, of, genappe, king, charles, was, furious, when, philip, refused, to, hand, over, louis, and, warned, the, duke, that, he, was, giving, shelter, to, a, fox, who, will, eat, his, chickens, in, 1461, louis, learned, that, his, father, was, dying, he, hurried, to, reims, to, be, crowned, in, case, his, brother, charles, duke, of, berry, should, try, to, do, the, same, louis, xi, became, king, of, france, on, 22, july, 1461, louis, pursued, many, of, the, same, goals, that, his, father, had, such, as, limiting, the, powers, of, the, dukes, and, barons, of, france, with, consistently, greater, success, among, other, initiatives, louis, instituted, reforms, to, make, the, tax, system, more, efficient, he, suppressed, many, of, his, former, co, conspirators, who, had, thought, him, their, friend, and, he, appointed, to, government, service, many, men, of, no, rank, but, who, had, shown, promising, talent, he, particularly, favored, the, associates, of, the, great, french, merchant, jacques, coeur, he, also, allowed, enterprising, nobles, to, engage, in, trade, without, losing, their, privileges, of, nobility, he, eliminated, offices, within, the, government, bureaucracy, and, increased, the, demand, on, other, offices, within, the, government, in, order, to, promote, efficiency, louis, spent, a, large, part, of, his, kingship, on, the, road, travelling, from, town, to, town, in, his, kingdom, louis, would, surprise, local, officials, investigate, local, governments, establish, fairs, and, promote, trade, regulations, perhaps, the, most, significant, contribution, of, louis, xi, to, the, organization, of, the, modern, state, of, france, was, his, development, of, the, system, of, royal, postal, roads, in, 1464, in, this, system, relays, at, instant, service, to, the, king, operated, on, all, the, high, roads, of, france, this, communications, network, spread, all, across, france, and, led, to, the, king, acquiring, his, nickname, universal, spider, as, king, louis, became, extremely, prudent, fiscally, whereas, he, had, previously, been, lavish, and, extravagant, he, wore, rough, and, simple, clothes, and, mixed, with, ordinary, people, and, merchants, a, candid, account, of, some, of, his, activities, is, recorded, by, the, courtier, philippe, de, commines, in, his, memoirs, of, the, period, louis, made, a, habit, of, surrounding, himself, with, valuable, advisers, of, humble, origins, such, as, commines, himself, olivier, le, daim, louis, tristan, l, hermite, and, jean, balue, louis, was, anxious, to, speed, up, everything, transform, everything, and, build, his, own, new, world, in, recognition, of, all, the, changes, that, louis, xi, made, to, the, government, of, france, he, has, the, reputation, of, a, leading, civil, reformer, in, french, history, and, his, reforms, were, in, the, interests, of, the, rising, trading, and, mercantile, classes, that, would, later, become, the, bourgeoisie, of, france, louis, xi, also, involved, himself, in, the, affairs, of, the, church, in, france, in, october, 1461, louis, abolished, the, pragmatic, sanction, that, his, father, had, instituted, in, 1438, to, establish, a, french, gallican, church, free, of, the, controls, of, the, popes, in, rome, philip, iii, was, the, duke, of, burgundy, at, the, time, that, louis, came, to, the, throne, and, was, keen, to, initiate, a, crusade, against, the, ottoman, empire, however, he, needed, funds, to, organize, such, an, enterprise, louis, xi, gave, him, 400, 000, gold, crowns, for, the, crusade, in, exchange, for, a, number, of, territories, including, picardy, and, amiens, however, philip, s, son, the, future, charles, i, duke, of, burgundy, known, as, the, count, of, charolais, at, the, time, of, louis, s, accession, was, angry, about, this, transaction, feeling, that, he, was, being, deprived, of, his, inheritance, he, joined, a, rebellion, called, the, league, of, the, public, weal, led, by, louis, s, brother, charles, the, duke, of, berry, although, the, rebels, were, largely, unsuccessful, in, battle, louis, had, no, better, luck, louis, xi, fought, an, indecisive, battle, against, the, rebels, at, montlh, ry, and, was, forced, to, grant, an, unfavourable, peace, as, a, matter, of, political, expediency, when, the, count, of, charolais, became, duke, of, burgundy, in, 1467, as, charles, i, the, bold, he, seriously, considered, declaring, an, independent, kingdom, of, his, own, however, louis, s, progress, toward, a, strong, centralized, government, had, advanced, to, the, point, where, the, dukes, of, burgundy, could, no, longer, act, as, independently, as, they, had, in, the, past, the, duchy, now, faced, many, problems, and, revolts, in, its, territories, especially, from, the, people, of, li, ge, who, conducted, the, li, ge, wars, against, the, duke, of, burgundy, in, the, li, ge, wars, louis, xi, allied, himself, at, first, with, the, people, of, li, ge, in, 1468, louis, and, charles, met, at, p, ronne, but, during, the, course, of, negotiations, they, learned, that, the, citizens, of, li, ge, had, again, risen, up, against, charles, and, killed, the, burgundian, governor, charles, was, furious, philippe, de, commines, at, that, time, in, the, service, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, had, to, calm, him, down, with, the, help, of, the, duke, s, other, advisors, for, fear, that, he, might, hit, the, king, louis, was, forced, into, a, humiliating, treaty, he, gave, up, many, of, the, lands, he, had, acquired, from, philip, the, good, turned, on, his, erstwhile, allies, in, li, ge, and, swore, to, help, charles, put, down, the, uprising, in, li, ge, louis, then, witnessed, a, siege, of, li, ge, in, which, hundreds, were, massacred, however, once, out, of, charles, s, reach, louis, declared, the, treaty, invalid, and, set, about, building, up, his, forces, his, aim, was, to, destroy, burgundy, once, and, for, all, nothing, was, more, odious, to, louis, dream, of, a, centralized, monarchy, than, the, existence, of, an, over, mighty, vassal, such, as, the, duke, of, burgundy, war, broke, out, in, 1472, duke, charles, laid, siege, to, beauvais, and, other, towns, however, these, sieges, proved, unsuccessful, the, siege, of, beauvais, was, lifted, on, 22, july, 1472, and, charles, finally, sued, for, peace, philippe, de, commines, was, then, welcomed, into, the, service, of, king, louis, in, 1469, louis, founded, the, order, of, st, michael, probably, in, imitation, of, the, prestigious, burgundian, order, of, the, golden, fleece, founded, by, charles, father, philip, the, good, just, as, king, john, ii, of, france, had, founded, the, now, defunct, order, of, the, star, in, imitation, of, the, order, of, the, garter, of, king, edward, iii, of, england, in, both, cases, a, french, king, appears, to, have, been, motivated, to, found, an, order, of, chivalry, to, increase, the, prestige, of, the, french, royal, court, by, the, example, of, his, chief, political, adversary, at, the, same, time, that, france, and, burgundy, were, fighting, each, other, england, was, experiencing, a, bitter, civil, conflict, now, known, as, the, wars, of, the, roses, louis, had, an, interest, in, this, war, for, the, duke, of, burgundy, charles, the, bold, was, allied, with, the, yorkists, who, opposed, king, henry, vi, when, the, earl, of, warwick, fell, out, with, the, yorkist, king, edward, iv, after, helping, edward, attain, his, throne, louis, granted, warwick, refuge, in, france, through, louis, s, diplomacy, warwick, then, formed, an, alliance, with, his, bitter, enemy, margaret, of, anjou, in, order, to, restore, her, husband, henry, vi, to, the, throne, the, plan, worked, and, edward, was, forced, into, exile, in, 1470, but, he, later, returned, to, england, in, 1471, warwick, was, then, killed, at, the, battle, of, barnet, in, 1471, king, henry, vi, was, soon, murdered, afterwards, now, the, undisputed, master, of, england, edward, invaded, france, in, 1475, but, louis, was, able, to, negotiate, the, treaty, of, picquigny, by, which, the, english, army, left, france, in, return, for, a, large, sum, of, money, the, english, renounced, their, claim, to, french, lands, such, as, normandy, and, the, hundred, years, war, could, be, said, to, be, finally, over, louis, bragged, that, although, his, father, had, driven, the, english, out, by, force, of, arms, he, had, driven, them, out, by, force, of, p, t, venison, and, good, french, wine, just, as, his, father, had, done, louis, spent, most, of, his, reign, dealing, with, political, disputes, with, the, reigning, duke, of, burgundy, and, for, this, purpose, he, employed, the, swiss, whose, military, might, was, renowned, he, had, admired, it, himself, at, the, battle, of, st, jakob, an, der, birs, war, broke, out, between, charles, and, the, swiss, after, he, invaded, switzerland, the, invasion, proved, to, be, a, tremendous, mistake, on, 2, march, 1476, the, swiss, attacked, and, defeated, the, burgundians, first, at, grandson, and, then, again, a, few, months, later, on, 22, june, that, year, at, murten, the, duke, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, nancy, on, 5, january, 1477, an, event, that, marked, the, end, of, the, burgundian, wars, louis, was, thus, able, to, see, the, destruction, of, his, sworn, enemy, those, lords, who, still, favored, the, feudal, system, gave, in, to, his, authority, others, such, as, jacques, d, armagnac, duke, of, nemours, were, executed, the, lands, belonging, to, the, duchy, of, burgundy, as, constituted, by, louis, s, great, great, grandfather, john, ii, for, the, benefit, of, his, son, philip, the, bold, reverted, to, the, crown, of, france, the, marriage, on, 14, february, 1451, between, 28, year, old, louis, and, the, 8, year, old, charlotte, of, savoy, was, the, true, beginning, of, french, involvement, in, the, affairs, of, italy, the, italian, peninsula, was, a, compact, and, politically, competitive, space, dominated, by, five, powers, venice, milan, florence, the, papacy, and, the, kingdom, of, naples, beside, these, five, great, regional, powers, there, were, about, a, dozen, smaller, states, in, italy, that, were, constantly, changing, policies, and, shifting, alliances, between, and, towards, the, various, regional, powers, the, city, state, of, genoa, and, the, rising, state, of, savoy, which, centered, on, the, city, of, turin, were, examples, of, these, lesser, powers, in, northern, italy, even, the, italic, league, the, combination, of, the, five, major, powers, of, italy, that, had, been, born, out, of, the, treaty, of, lodi, of, 1454, was, constantly, undergoing, internal, realignments, both, louis, xi, and, his, father, charles, vii, had, been, too, busy, with, their, struggles, with, burgundy, to, pay, much, attention, to, political, affairs, smoldering, in, italy, additionally, louis, had, his, attention, drawn, away, from, italy, by, disagreements, with, the, rulers, of, england, and, his, struggles, with, maximilian, of, austria, who, married, the, heir, of, charles, the, bold, mary, of, burgundy, and, wanted, to, keep, her, territorial, inheritance, intact, however, the, death, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, in, 1477, which, conclusively, settled, the, issue, of, burgundy, s, position, under, the, french, throne, the, conclusion, of, the, treaty, of, picquigny, with, england, in, 1475, and, the, peaceful, resolution, in, 1482, of, the, disposition, of, the, burgundian, inheritance, left, to, mary, of, burgundy, finally, allowed, louis, xi, to, turn, his, attention, to, italy, viewed, from, the, italian, states, the, death, of, the, duke, of, burgundy, in, 1477, and, the, resultant, downfall, of, his, duchy, as, a, threat, to, the, french, throne, signalled, vast, changes, in, the, states, relationships, with, the, kingdom, of, france, despite, his, connection, by, marriage, to, the, royal, house, of, savoy, louis, xi, continuously, courted, a, strong, relationship, with, francesco, i, sforza, the, duke, of, milan, who, was, a, traditional, enemy, of, savoy, as, a, confirmation, of, the, close, relationship, between, milan, and, the, king, of, france, sforza, sent, his, son, galeazzo, maria, sforza, to, aid, louis, xi, in, his, war, against, the, league, of, public, weal, in, 1465, at, the, head, of, a, large, army, later, differences, arose, between, france, and, milan, that, caused, milan, to, seek, ways, of, separating, itself, from, dependence, on, the, french, however, with, the, downfall, of, burgundy, in, 1477, france, was, seen, in, a, new, light, by, milan, which, now, hurriedly, repaired, its, relationship, with, louis, xi, likewise, france, s, old, enemy, king, ferdinand, i, of, naples, began, to, seek, a, marriage, alliance, between, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, france, louis, xi, also, opened, new, friendly, relations, with, the, papal, states, forgetting, the, past, devotion, of, the, popes, for, the, duke, of, burgundy, in, january, 1478, he, signed, a, favorable, treaty, with, the, republic, of, venice, french, involvement, in, the, affairs, of, italy, would, be, carried, to, new, levels, by, louis, xi, s, son, charles, viii, in, 1493, when, he, answered, an, appeal, for, help, from, ludovico, sforza, the, younger, son, of, francesco, sforza, that, led, to, an, invasion, of, italy, this, would, become, a, significant, turning, point, in, italian, political, history, louis, xi, having, suffered, from, bouts, of, apoplexy, and, years, of, illness, died, on, 30, august, 1483, and, was, interred, in, the, basilica, of, notre, dame, de, cl, ry, in, cl, ry, saint, andr, in, the, arrondissement, of, orl, ans, his, widow, charlotte, died, a, few, months, later, and, is, interred, with, him, louis, xi, was, succeeded, by, his, son, charles, viii, who, was, thirteen, years, of, age, louis, eldest, daughter, anne, became, regent, on, charles, behalf, eager, to, obtain, information, about, his, enemies, louis, created, from, 1464, a, net, of, postal, relays, all, over, france, which, was, a, precursor, to, the, modern, french, postal, service, louis, developed, his, kingdom, by, encouraging, trade, fairs, and, the, building, and, maintenance, of, roads, louis, xi, pursued, the, organization, of, the, kingdom, of, france, with, the, assistance, of, bourgeois, officials, in, some, respects, louis, xi, perfected, the, framework, of, the, modern, french, government, which, was, to, last, until, the, french,
