french, educator, and, historian, co, founder, of, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, and, its, second, president, he, is, known, as, the, father, of, the, modern, olympic, games, he, was, particularly, active, in, promoting, the, introduction, of, sport, in, french, schools, born, into, a, french, aristocratic, family, coubertin, became, an, academic, and, studied, a, broad, range, of, topics, most, notably, education, and, history, he, graduated, with, a, degree, in, law, and, public, affairs, from, the, institut, d, tudes, politiques, de, paris, sciences, po, it, was, at, the, institut, d, tudes, politiques, de, paris, that, he, came, up, with, the, idea, of, reviving, the, olympic, games, the, pierre, de, coubertin, world, trophy, and, the, pierre, de, coubertin, medal, are, named, in, his, honour, pierre, de, fr, dy, was, born, in, paris, on, 1, january, 1863, into, an, aristocratic, family, he, was, the, fourth, child, of, baron, charles, louis, de, fr, dy, baron, de, coubertin, and, marie, marcelle, gigault, de, crisenoy, family, tradition, held, that, the, fr, dy, name, had, first, arrived, in, france, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, the, first, recorded, title, of, nobility, granted, to, the, family, was, given, by, louis, xi, to, an, ancestor, also, named, pierre, de, fr, dy, in, 1477, but, other, branches, of, his, family, tree, delved, even, further, into, french, history, and, the, annals, of, both, sides, of, his, family, included, nobles, of, various, stations, military, leaders, and, associates, of, kings, and, princes, of, france, his, father, charles, was, a, staunch, royalist, and, accomplished, artist, whose, paintings, were, displayed, and, given, prizes, at, the, parisian, salon, at, least, in, those, years, when, he, was, not, absent, in, protest, of, the, rise, to, power, of, louis, napoleon, his, paintings, often, centered, on, themes, related, to, the, catholic, church, classicism, and, nobility, which, reflected, those, things, he, thought, most, important, in, a, later, semi, fictional, autobiographical, piece, called, le, roman, d, un, ralli, coubertin, describes, his, relationship, with, both, his, mother, and, his, father, as, having, been, somewhat, strained, during, his, childhood, and, adolescence, his, memoirs, elaborated, further, describing, as, a, pivotal, moment, his, disappointment, upon, meeting, henri, count, of, chambord, whom, the, elder, coubertin, believed, to, be, the, rightful, king, coubertin, grew, up, in, a, time, of, profound, change, in, france, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, the, paris, commune, and, the, establishment, of, the, third, republic, but, while, these, events, were, the, setting, of, his, childhood, his, school, experiences, were, just, as, formative, in, october, 1874, his, parents, enrolled, him, in, a, new, jesuit, school, called, externat, de, la, rue, de, vienne, which, was, still, under, construction, for, his, first, five, years, there, while, many, of, the, school, s, attendees, were, day, students, coubertin, boarded, at, the, school, under, the, supervision, of, a, jesuit, priest, which, his, parents, hoped, would, instill, him, with, a, strong, moral, and, religious, education, there, he, was, among, the, top, three, students, in, his, class, and, was, an, officer, of, the, school, s, elite, academy, made, up, of, its, best, and, brightest, this, suggests, that, despite, his, rebelliousness, at, home, coubertin, adapted, well, to, the, strict, rigors, of, a, jesuit, education, as, an, aristocrat, coubertin, had, a, number, of, career, paths, from, which, to, choose, including, potentially, prominent, roles, in, the, military, or, politics, but, he, chose, instead, to, pursue, a, career, as, an, intellectual, studying, and, later, writing, on, a, broad, range, of, topics, including, education, history, literature, and, sociology, the, subject, which, he, seems, to, have, been, most, deeply, interested, in, was, education, and, his, study, focused, in, particular, on, physical, education, and, the, role, of, sport, in, schooling, in, 1883, at, the, age, of, twenty, he, visited, england, for, the, first, time, and, studied, the, program, of, physical, education, instituted, under, thomas, arnold, at, the, rugby, school, coubertin, credited, these, methods, with, leading, to, the, expansion, of, british, power, during, the, 19th, century, and, advocated, their, use, in, french, institutions, the, inclusion, of, physical, education, in, the, curriculum, of, french, schools, would, become, an, ongoing, pursuit, and, passion, of, coubertin, s, coubertin, is, thought, to, have, exaggerated, the, importance, of, sport, to, thomas, arnold, whom, he, viewed, as, one, of, the, founders, of, athletic, chivalry, the, character, reforming, influence, of, sport, with, which, coubertin, was, so, impressed, is, more, likely, to, have, originated, in, the, novel, tom, brown, s, school, days, published, in, 1857, rather, than, exclusively, in, the, ideas, of, arnold, himself, nonetheless, coubertin, was, an, enthusiast, in, need, of, a, cause, and, he, found, it, in, england, and, in, thomas, arnold, thomas, arnold, the, leader, and, classic, model, of, english, educators, wrote, coubertin, gave, the, precise, formula, for, the, role, of, athletics, in, education, the, cause, was, quickly, won, playing, fields, sprang, up, all, over, england, he, visited, other, english, schools, to, see, for, himself, he, described, the, results, in, a, book, l, education, en, angleterre, which, was, published, in, paris, in, 1888, the, hero, of, his, book, is, thomas, arnold, and, on, his, second, visit, in, 1886, coubertin, reflected, on, arnold, s, influence, in, the, chapel, at, rugby, school, what, coubertin, saw, on, the, playing, fields, of, the, english, schools, he, visited, was, how, organised, sport, can, create, moral, and, social, strength, not, only, did, organized, games, help, to, set, the, mind, and, body, in, equilibrium, it, also, prevented, the, time, being, wasted, in, other, ways, first, developed, by, the, ancient, greeks, it, was, an, approach, to, education, that, he, felt, the, rest, of, the, world, had, forgotten, and, to, whose, revival, he, was, to, dedicate, the, rest, of, his, life, as, a, historian, and, a, thinker, on, education, coubertin, romanticized, ancient, greece, thus, when, he, began, to, develop, his, theory, of, physical, education, he, naturally, looked, to, the, example, set, by, the, athenian, idea, of, the, gymnasium, a, training, facility, that, simultaneously, encouraged, physical, and, intellectual, development, he, saw, in, these, gymnasia, what, he, called, a, triple, unity, between, old, and, young, between, disciplines, and, between, different, types, of, people, meaning, between, those, whose, work, was, theoretical, and, those, whose, work, was, practical, coubertin, advocated, for, these, concepts, this, triple, unity, to, be, incorporated, into, schools, while, coubertin, was, certainly, a, romantic, and, while, his, idealized, vision, of, ancient, greece, would, lead, him, later, to, the, idea, of, reviving, the, olympic, games, his, advocacy, for, physical, education, was, also, based, on, practical, concerns, he, believed, that, men, who, received, physical, education, would, be, better, prepared, to, fight, in, wars, and, better, able, to, win, conflicts, like, the, franco, prussian, war, in, which, france, had, been, humiliated, he, also, saw, sport, as, democratic, in, that, sports, competition, crossed, class, lines, although, it, did, so, without, causing, a, mingling, of, classes, which, he, did, not, support, unfortunately, for, coubertin, his, efforts, to, incorporate, more, physical, education, into, french, schools, failed, the, failure, of, this, endeavor, however, was, closely, followed, by, the, development, of, a, new, idea, the, revival, of, the, ancient, olympic, games, the, creation, of, a, festival, of, international, athleticism, he, was, the, referee, of, the, first, ever, french, championship, rugby, union, final, on, 20, march, 1892, between, racing, club, de, france, and, stade, fran, ais, thomas, arnold, the, head, master, of, rugby, school, was, an, important, influence, on, coubertin, s, thoughts, about, education, but, his, meetings, with, william, penny, brookes, also, influenced, his, thinking, about, athletic, competition, to, some, extent, a, trained, physician, brookes, believed, that, the, best, way, to, prevent, illness, was, through, physical, exercise, in, 1850, he, had, initiated, a, local, athletic, competition, that, he, referred, to, as, meetings, of, the, olympian, class, at, the, gaskell, recreation, ground, at, much, wenlock, shropshire, along, with, the, liverpool, athletic, club, who, began, holding, their, own, olympic, festival, in, the, 1860s, brookes, created, a, national, olympian, association, which, aimed, to, encourage, such, local, competition, in, cities, across, britain, these, efforts, were, largely, ignored, by, the, british, sporting, establishment, brookes, also, maintained, communication, with, the, government, and, sporting, advocates, in, greece, seeking, a, revival, of, the, olympic, games, internationally, under, the, auspices, of, the, greek, government, there, the, philanthropist, cousins, evangelos, and, konstantinos, zappas, had, used, their, wealth, to, fund, olympics, within, greece, and, paid, for, the, restoration, of, the, panathinaiko, stadium, that, was, later, used, during, the, 1896, summer, olympics, the, efforts, of, brookes, to, encourage, the, internationalization, of, these, games, came, to, naught, in, his, own, lifetime, before, his, death, in, 1895, however, brookes, did, organize, a, national, olympic, games, in, london, at, crystal, palace, in, 1866, and, this, was, the, first, olympics, to, resemble, an, olympic, games, to, be, held, outside, of, greece, but, while, others, had, created, olympic, contests, within, their, countries, and, broached, the, idea, of, international, competition, it, was, coubertin, whose, work, would, lead, to, the, establishment, of, the, international, olympic, committee, and, the, organization, of, the, first, modern, olympic, games, in, 1888, coubertin, founded, the, comit, pour, la, propagation, des, exercises, physiques, more, well, known, as, the, comit, jules, simon, coubertin, s, earliest, reference, to, the, modern, notion, of, olympic, games, criticizes, the, idea, the, idea, for, reviving, the, olympic, games, as, an, international, competition, came, to, coubertin, in, 1889, apparently, independently, of, brookes, and, he, spent, the, following, five, years, organizing, an, international, meeting, of, athletes, and, sports, enthusiasts, that, might, make, it, happen, in, response, to, a, newspaper, appeal, brookes, wrote, to, coubertin, in, 1890, and, the, two, began, an, exchange, of, letters, on, education, and, sport, although, he, was, too, old, to, attend, the, 1894, congress, brookes, would, continue, to, support, coubertin, s, efforts, most, importantly, by, using, his, connections, with, the, greek, government, to, seek, its, support, in, the, endeavour, while, brookes, contribution, to, the, revival, of, the, olympic, games, was, recognized, in, britain, at, the, time, coubertin, in, his, later, writings, largely, neglected, to, mention, the, role, the, englishman, played, in, their, development, he, did, mention, the, roles, of, evangelis, zappas, and, his, cousin, konstantinos, zappas, but, drew, a, distinction, between, their, founding, of, athletic, olympics, and, his, own, role, in, the, creation, of, an, international, contest, however, coubertin, together, with, a, mercatis, a, close, friend, of, konstantinos, encouraged, the, greek, government, to, utilise, part, of, konstantinos, legacy, to, fund, the, 1896, athens, olympic, games, separately, and, in, addition, to, the, legacy, of, evangelis, zappas, that, konstantinos, had, been, executor, of, moreover, george, averoff, was, invited, by, the, greek, government, to, fund, the, second, refurbishment, of, the, panathinaiko, stadium, that, had, already, been, fully, funded, by, evangelis, zappas, forty, years, earlier, coubertin, s, advocacy, for, the, games, centered, on, a, number, of, ideals, about, sport, he, believed, that, the, early, ancient, olympics, encouraged, competition, among, amateur, rather, than, professional, athletes, and, saw, value, in, that, the, ancient, practice, of, a, sacred, truce, in, association, with, the, games, might, have, modern, implications, giving, the, olympics, a, role, in, promoting, peace, this, role, was, reinforced, in, coubertin, s, mind, by, the, tendency, of, athletic, competition, to, promote, understanding, across, cultures, thereby, lessening, the, dangers, of, war, in, addition, he, saw, the, games, as, important, in, advocating, his, philosophical, ideal, for, athletic, competition, that, the, competition, itself, the, struggle, to, overcome, one, s, opponent, was, more, important, than, winning, coubertin, expressed, this, ideal, thus, l, important, dans, la, vie, ce, n, est, point, le, triomphe, mais, le, combat, l, essentiel, ce, n, est, pas, d, avoir, vaincu, mais, de, s, tre, bien, battu, the, important, thing, in, life, is, not, the, triumph, but, the, struggle, the, essential, thing, is, not, to, have, conquered, but, to, have, fought, well, as, coubertin, prepared, for, his, congress, he, continued, to, develop, a, philosophy, of, the, olympic, games, while, he, certainly, intended, the, games, to, be, a, forum, for, competition, between, amateur, athletes, his, conception, of, amateurism, was, complex, by, 1894, the, year, the, congress, was, held, he, publicly, criticized, the, type, of, amateur, competition, embodied, in, english, rowing, contests, arguing, that, its, specific, exclusion, of, working, class, athletes, was, wrong, while, he, believed, that, athletes, should, not, be, paid, to, be, such, he, did, think, that, compensation, was, in, order, for, the, time, when, athletes, were, competing, and, would, otherwise, have, been, earning, money, following, the, establishment, of, a, definition, for, an, amateur, athlete, at, the, 1894, congress, he, would, continue, to, argue, that, this, definition, should, be, amended, as, necessary, and, as, late, as, 1909, would, argue, that, the, olympic, movement, should, develop, its, definition, of, amateurism, gradually, along, with, the, development, of, an, olympic, philosophy, coubertin, invested, time, in, the, creation, and, development, of, a, national, association, to, coordinate, athletics, in, france, the, union, des, soci, t, s, fran, aises, de, sports, athl, tiques, usfsa, in, 1889, french, athletics, associations, had, grouped, together, for, the, first, time, and, coubertin, founded, a, monthly, magazine, la, revue, athletique, the, first, french, periodical, devoted, exclusively, to, athletics, and, modelled, on, the, athlete, an, english, journal, established, around, 1862, formed, by, seven, sporting, societies, with, approximately, 800, members, by, 1892, the, association, had, expanded, to, 62, societies, with, 7, 000, members, that, november, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, usfsa, coubertin, first, publicly, suggested, the, idea, of, reviving, the, olympics, his, speech, met, general, applause, but, little, commitment, to, the, olympic, ideal, he, was, advocating, for, perhaps, because, sporting, associations, and, their, members, tended, to, focus, on, their, area, of, expertise, and, had, little, identity, as, sportspeople, in, a, general, sense, this, disappointing, result, was, the, prelude, to, several, challenges, he, would, face, in, organizing, his, international, conference, to, develop, support, for, the, conference, he, began, to, play, down, its, role, in, reviving, olympic, games, and, instead, promoted, it, as, a, conference, on, amateurism, in, sport, which, he, thought, was, slowly, being, eroded, by, betting, and, sponsorships, this, led, to, later, suggestions, that, participants, were, convinced, to, attend, under, false, pretenses, little, interest, was, expressed, by, those, he, spoke, to, during, trips, to, the, united, states, in, 1893, and, london, in, 1894, and, an, attempt, to, involve, the, germans, angered, french, gymnasts, who, did, not, want, the, germans, invited, at, all, despite, these, challenges, the, usfsa, continued, its, planning, for, the, games, adopting, in, its, first, program, for, the, meeting, eight, articles, to, address, only, one, of, which, had, to, do, with, the, olympics, a, later, program, would, give, the, olympics, a, much, more, prominent, role, in, the, meeting, the, congress, was, held, on, 23, june, 1894, at, the, sorbonne, in, paris, once, there, participants, divided, the, congress, into, two, commissions, one, on, amateurism, and, the, other, on, reviving, the, olympics, a, greek, participant, demetrios, vikelas, was, appointed, to, head, the, commission, on, the, olympics, and, would, later, become, the, first, president, of, the, international, olympic, committee, along, with, coubertin, c, herbert, of, britain, s, amateur, athletic, association, and, w, m, sloane, of, the, united, states, helped, lead, the, efforts, of, the, commission, in, its, report, the, commission, proposed, that, the, olympic, games, be, held, every, four, years, and, that, the, program, for, the, games, be, one, of, modern, rather, than, ancient, sports, they, also, set, the, date, and, location, for, the, first, modern, olympic, games, the, 1896, summer, olympics, in, athens, greece, and, the, second, the, 1900, summer, olympics, in, paris, coubertin, had, originally, opposed, the, choice, of, greece, as, he, had, concerns, about, the, ability, of, a, weakened, greek, state, to, host, the, competition, but, was, convinced, by, vikelas, to, support, the, idea, the, commission, s, proposals, were, accepted, unanimously, by, the, congress, and, the, modern, olympic, movement, was, officially, born, the, proposals, of, the, other, commission, on, amateurism, were, more, contentious, but, this, commission, also, set, important, precedents, for, the, olympic, games, specifically, the, use, of, heats, to, narrow, participants, and, the, banning, of, prize, money, in, most, contests, following, the, congress, the, institutions, created, there, began, to, be, formalized, into, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, with, demetrios, vikelas, as, its, first, president, the, work, of, the, ioc, increasingly, focused, on, the, planning, of, the, 1896, athens, games, and, de, coubertin, played, a, background, role, as, greek, authorities, took, the, lead, in, logistical, organization, of, the, games, in, greece, itself, offering, technical, advice, such, as, a, sketch, of, a, design, of, a, velodrome, to, be, used, in, cycling, competitions, he, also, took, the, lead, in, planning, the, program, of, events, although, to, his, disappointment, polo, football, and, boxing, were, not, included, in, 1896, the, greek, organizing, committee, had, been, informed, that, four, foreign, football, teams, had, entered, however, none, of, them, showed, up, in, athens, and, despite, greek, preparations, for, a, football, tournament, it, was, cancelled, during, the, games, the, greek, authorities, were, also, frustrated, that, he, could, not, provide, an, exact, estimate, of, the, number, of, attendees, more, than, a, year, in, advance, in, france, coubertin, s, efforts, to, elicit, interest, in, the, games, among, athletes, and, the, press, met, difficulty, largely, because, the, participation, of, german, athletes, angered, french, nationalists, who, begrudged, germany, their, victory, in, the, franco, prussian, war, germany, also, threatened, not, to, participate, after, rumors, spread, that, coubertin, had, sworn, to, keep, germany, out, but, following, a, letter, to, the, kaiser, denying, the, accusation, the, german, national, olympic, committee, decided, to, attend, coubertin, himself, was, frustrated, by, the, greeks, who, increasingly, ignored, him, in, their, planning, and, who, wanted, to, continue, to, hold, the, games, in, athens, every, four, years, against, de, coubertin, s, wishes, the, conflict, was, resolved, after, he, suggested, to, the, king, of, greece, that, he, hold, pan, hellenic, games, in, between, olympiads, an, idea, which, the, king, accepted, although, coubertin, would, receive, some, angry, correspondence, even, after, the, compromise, was, reached, and, the, king, did, not, mention, him, at, all, during, the, banquet, held, in, honor, of, foreign, athletes, during, the, 1896, games, coubertin, took, over, the, ioc, presidency, when, demetrios, vikelas, stepped, down, after, the, olympics, in, his, own, country, despite, the, initial, success, the, olympic, movement, faced, hard, times, as, the, 1900, games, in, de, coubertin, s, own, paris, and, 1904, games, were, both, overshadowed, by, world, s, fairs, in, the, same, cities, and, received, little, attention, further, to, this, the, paris, games, were, organized, by, the, organizing, committee, of, the, exposition, universelle, who, disagreed, with, de, coubertin, s, ideas, and, subsequently, fired, him, nor, were, they, called, olympics, at, that, time, while, the, st, louis, games, were, predominantly, american, the, 1906, summer, olympics, revived, the, momentum, and, the, olympic, games, have, come, to, be, regarded, as, the, world, s, foremost, sports, competition, coubertin, created, the, modern, pentathlon, for, the, 1912, olympics, and, subsequently, stepped, down, from, his, ioc, presidency, after, the, 1924, olympics, in, paris, which, proved, much, more, successful, than, the, first, attempt, in, that, city, in, 1900, he, was, succeeded, as, president, in, 1925, by, belgian, henri, de, baillet, latour, years, later, coubertin, came, out, of, retirement, to, lend, his, prestige, to, assisting, berlin, to, land, the, 1936, games, in, exchange, germany, nominated, him, for, the, nobel, peace, prize, the, 1935, winner, however, was, the, anti, nazi, carl, von, ossietzky, coubertin, won, the, gold, medal, for, literature, at, the, 1912, summer, olympics, for, his, poem, ode, to, sport, coubertin, entered, the, poem, under, the, pseudonym, of, georges, hohrod, and, m, eschbach, which, were, the, names, of, villages, close, to, his, wife, s, place, of, birth, following, francisco, amoros, ideas, de, coubertin, developed, a, new, type, of, utilitarian, sport, les, d, brouillards, the, resourceful, men, from, 1900, the, first, d, brouillards, season, was, organized, in, 1905, 1906, and, the, program, was, wide, running, jumping, throwing, climbing, swimming, sword, fighting, boxing, shooting, walking, horse, riding, rowing, and, cycling, source, ffepgv, archives, in, 1911, pierre, de, coubertin, founded, the, inter, religious, scouting, organization, aka, claireurs, fran, ais, ef, in, france, which, later, merged, to, form, the, claireuses, et, claireurs, de, france, in, 1895, pierre, de, coubertin, married, marie, rothan, the, daughter, of, family, friends, their, son, jacques, 1896, 1952, became, sick, after, being, in, the, sun, too, long, when, he, was, a, little, child, their, daughter, ren, e, 1902, 1968, suffered, emotional, disturbances, and, never, married, marie, and, pierre, tried, to, console, themselves, with, two, nephews, but, they, were, killed, at, the, front, in, world, war, i, coubertin, died, of, a, heart, attack, in, geneva, switzerland, on, 2, september, 1937, and, was, buried, in, bois, de, vaux, cemetery, in, lausanne, marie, died, in, 1963, at, the, 139th, ioc, session, around, the, 2022, winter, olympics, french, ioc, member, and, olympic, gold, medalist, guy, drut, informed, the, ioc, of, his, proposal, to, have, de, coubertin, s, remains, reinterred, at, the, panth, on, in, time, for, the, 2024, summer, olympics, drut, stated, that, he, had, support, from, de, coubertin, s, family, as, well, as, acad, mie, fran, aise, member, rik, orsenna, and, had, written, to, french, president, emmanuel, macron, in, response, ioc, president, thomas, bach, commented, that, he, thought, it, was, a, wonderful, proposal, and, deserves, to, be, successful, however, he, doubted, the, ioc, could, make, any, steps, on, this, initiative, which, we, appreciate, considerably, yet, wished, him, on, behalf, of, the, ioc, the, best, of, success, in, getting, this, initiative, to, fruition, drut, announced, that, he, had, written, to, macron, to, propose, the, creation, of, a, study, commission, for, this, project, after, his, death, and, according, to, his, wish, his, heart, was, taken, to, olympia, to, rest, in, the, memorial, stele, erected, in, his, honor, by, the, greek, government, in, 1937, the, stele, is, located, in, the, coubertin, grove, of, the, international, olympic, academy, when, the, olympic, flame, is, lit, in, olympia, the, first, torchbearer, brings, it, to, light, the, marble, altar, in, the, coubertin, grove, the, flame, then, goes, onto, athens, and, subsequently, the, host, city, pierre, de, coubertin, was, the, last, person, to, possess, his, family, name, in, the, words, of, his, biographer, john, macaloon, the, last, of, his, lineage, pierre, de, coubertin, was, the, only, member, of, it, whose, fame, would, outlive, him, a, number, of, scholars, have, criticized, coubertin, s, legacy, david, c, young, believes, that, coubertin, s, assertion, that, ancient, olympic, athletes, were, amateurs, was, incorrect, the, issue, is, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, young, and, others, argue, that, the, athletes, of, the, ancient, games, were, professional, while, opponents, led, by, pleket, argue, that, the, earliest, olympic, athletes, were, in, fact, amateur, and, that, the, games, only, became, professionalized, after, about, 480, bc, coubertin, agreed, with, this, latter, view, and, saw, this, professionalization, as, undercutting, the, morality, of, the, competition, further, young, asserts, that, the, effort, to, limit, international, competition, to, amateur, athletes, which, coubertin, was, a, part, of, was, in, fact, part, of, efforts, to, give, the, upper, classes, greater, control, over, athletic, competition, removing, such, control, from, the, working, classes, coubertin, may, have, played, a, role, in, such, a, movement, but, his, defenders, argue, that, he, did, so, unconscious, of, any, class, repercussions, however, it, is, clear, that, his, romanticized, vision, of, the, ancient, olympic, games, was, fundamentally, different, from, that, described, in, the, historical, record, for, example, coubertin, s, idea, that, participation, is, more, important, than, winning, l, important, c, est, de, participer, is, at, odds, with, the, ideals, of, the, greeks, coubertin, s, assertion, that, the, games, were, the, impetus, for, peace, was, also, an, exaggeration, the, peace, which, he, spoke, of, only, existed, to, allow, athletes, to, travel, safely, to, olympia, and, neither, prevented, the, outbreak, of, wars, nor, ended, ongoing, ones, scholars, have, critiqued, the, idea, that, athletic, competition, might, lead, to, greater, understanding, between, cultures, and, therefore, to, peace, christopher, hill, claims, that, modern, participants, in, the, olympic, movement, may, defend, this, particular, belief, in, a, spirit, similar, to, that, in, which, the, church, of, england, remains, attached, to, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, religion, which, a, priest, in, that, church, must, sign, in, other, words, that, they, may, not, wholly, believe, it, but, hold, to, it, for, historical, reasons, questions, have, also, been, raised, about, the, veracity, of, coubertin, s, account, of, his, role, in, the, planning, of, the, 1896, athens, games, reportedly, coubertin, played, little, role, in, planning, despite, entreaties, by, vikelas, young, suggests, that, the, story, about, coubertin, s, having, sketched, the, velodrome, were, untrue, and, that, he, had, in, fact, given, an, interview, in, which, he, suggested, he, did, not, want, germans, to, participate, coubertin, later, denied, this, coubertin, also, spoke, against, women, s, sports, and, the, women, s, world, games, impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic, and, we, are, not, afraid, to, add, incorrect, such, would, be, in, our, opinion, this, female, half, olympiad, the, traditional, olympic, motto, citius, altius, fortius, faster, higher, stronger, was, proposed, by, coubertin, in, 1894, and, was, official, from, 1924, until, modified, to, the, current, citius, altius, fortius, communiter, faster, higher, stronger, together, in, 2021, the, traditional, motto, was, coined, by, henri, didon, op, a, friend, of, coubertin, for, a, paris, youth, gathering, of, 1891, the, pierre, de, coubertin, world, trophy, given, by, the, international, fair, play, committee, has, been, awarded,
