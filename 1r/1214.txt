reader, and, later, developed, an, interest, in, writing, and, a, life, outside, saint, croix, he, wrote, a, detailed, letter, to, his, father, regarding, a, hurricane, that, devastated,

from, there, to, new, york, city, where, he, took, lodgings, with, the, irish, born, hercules, mulligan, brother, of, a, trader, known, to, hamilton, s, benefactors, who, assisted, hamilton, in, selling, cargo, that, was, used, to, pay, for, his, education, and, support, later, that, year, in, preparation, for, college, hamilton, began, to, fill, gaps, in, his, education, at, the, elizabethtown, academy, a, preparatory, school, run, by, francis, barber, in, elizabeth, new, jersey, while, there, he, came, under, the, influence, of, william, livingston, a, local, leading, intellectual, and, revolutionary, with, whom, he, lived, for, a, time, hamilton, entered, mulligan, s, alma, mater, king, s, college, now, columbia, university, in, new, york, city, in, the, autumn, of, 1773, as, a, private, student, while, again, boarding, with, mulligan, until, officially, matriculating, in, may, 1774, his, college, roommate, and, lifelong, friend, robert, troup, spoke, glowingly, of, hamilton, s, clarity, in, concisely, explaining, the, patriots, case, against, the, british, in, what, is, credited, as, hamilton, s, first, public, appearance, on, july, 6, 1773, as,

writings, a, full, vindication, of, the, measures, of, congress, and, the, farmer, refuted, seabury, essentially, tried, to, provoke, fear, in, the, colonies, with, an, objective, of, preventing, the, colonies, from, uniting, against, the, british, hamilton, published, two, additional, pieces, attacking, the, quebec, act, and, may, have, also, authored, the, 15, anonymous, installments, of, the, monitor, for, holt, s, new, york, journal, hamilton, was, a, supporter, of, the, revolutionary, cause, before, the, war, began, although, he, did, not, approve, of, mob, reprisals, against, loyalists, on, may, 10, 1775, hamilton, won, credit, for, saving, his, college, s, president, loyalist, myles, cooper, from, an, angry, mob, by, speaking, to, the, crowd, long, enough, to, allow, cooper, to, escape, hamilton, was, forced, to, discontinue, his, studies, before, graduating, when, the, college, closed, its, doors, during, the, british, occupation, of, new, york, city, in, 1775, after, the,

after, and, at, the, battle, of, white, plains, a, month, later, at, the, battle, of, trenton, the, company, was, stationed, at, the, high, point, of, trenton, at, the, intersection, of, present, day,

nathanael, greene, or, alexander, mcdougall, he, declined, these, invitations, believing, his, best, chance, for, improving, his, station, in, life, was, glory, on, the, revolutionary, war, s, battlefields, hamilton, eventually, received, an, invitation, he, felt, he, could, not, refuse, to, serve, as, washington, s, aide, with, the, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, washington, believed, that, aides, de, camp, are, persons, in, whom, entire, confidence, must, be, placed, and, it, requires, men, of, abilities, to, execute, the, duties, with, propriety, and, dispatch, hamilton, served, four, years, as, washington, s, chief, staff, aide, he, handled, letters, to, the, continental, congress, state, governors, and, the, most, powerful, generals, of, the, continental, army, he, drafted,

a, wide, variety, of, high, level, duties, including, intelligence, diplomacy, and, negotiation, with, senior, army, officers, as, washington, s, emissary, during, the, revolutionary, war, hamilton, became, the, close, friend, of, several, fellow, officers, his, letters, to, the, marquis, de, lafayette, and, to, john, laurens, employing, the, sentimental, literary, conventions, of, the, late, 18th, century, and, alluding, to, greek, history, and, mythology, have, been, read, by, jonathan, ned, katz, as, revelatory, of, a, homosocial, or, even, homosexual, relationship, biographer, gregory, d, massey, amongst, others, by, contrast, dismisses, all, such, speculation, as, unsubstantiated, describing, their, friendship, as, purely, platonic, camaraderie, instead, and, placing, their, correspondence, in, the, context, of, the, flowery, diction, of, the, time, while, on, washington, s, staff, hamilton, long, sought, command, and, a, return, to, active, combat, as, the, war, drew, nearer, to, an, end, he, knew, that, opportunities, for, military, glory, were, diminishing, on, february, 15, 1781, hamilton, was, reprimanded, by, washington, after, a, minor, misunderstanding, although, washington, quickly, tried, to, mend, their, relationship, hamilton, insisted, on, leaving, his, staff, he, officially, left, in, march, and, settled, with, his, new, wife, elizabeth, schuyler, close, to, washington, s, headquarters, he, continued, to, repeatedly, ask, washington, and, others, for, a, field, command, washington, continued, to, demur, citing, the, need, to, appoint, men, of, higher, rank, this, continued, until, early, july, 1781, when, hamilton, submitted, a, letter, to, washington, with, his, commission, enclosed, thus, tacitly, threatening, to, resign, if, he, didn, t, get, his, desired, command, on, july, 31, washington, relented, and, assigned, hamilton, as, commander, of, a, battalion, of, light, infantry, companies, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, new, york, regiments, and, two, provisional, companies, from, connecticut, in, the, planning, for, the, assault, on, yorktown, hamilton, was, given, command, of, three, battalions, which, were, to, fight, in, conjunction, with, the, allied, french, troops, in, taking, redoubts, no, 9, and, no, 10, of, the, british, fortifications, at, yorktown, hamilton, and, his, battalions, took, redoubt, no, 10, with, bayonets, in, a, nighttime, action, as, planned, the, french, also, suffered, heavy, casualties, and, took, redoubt, no, 9, these, actions, forced, the, british, surrender, of, an, entire, army, at, yorktown, marking, the, de, facto, end, of, the, war, although, small, battles, continued, for, two, more, years, until, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, and, the, departure, of, the, last, british, troops, after, yorktown, hamilton, returned, to, new, york, city, and, resigned, his, commission, in, march, 1782, he, passed, the, bar, in, july, after, six, months, of, self, directed, education, and, in, october, was, licensed, to, argue, cases, before, the, supreme, court, of, new, york, he, also, accepted, an, offer, from, robert, morris, to, become, receiver, of, continental, taxes, for, the, new, york, state, hamilton, was, appointed, in, july, 1782, to, the, congress, of, the, confederation, as, a, new, york, representative, for, the, term, beginning, in, november, 1782, before, his, appointment, to, congress, in, 1782, hamilton, was, already, sharing, his, criticisms, of, congress, he, expressed, these, criticisms, in, his, letter, to, james, duane, dated, september, 3, 1780, the, fundamental, defect, is, a, want, of, power, in, congress, the, confederation, itself, is, defective, and, requires, to, be, altered, it, is, neither, fit, for, war, nor, peace, while, on, washington, s, staff, hamilton, had, become, frustrated, with, the, decentralized, nature, of, the, wartime, continental, congress, particularly, its, dependence, upon, the, states, for, voluntary, financial, support, that, was, not, often, forthcoming, under, the, articles, of, confederation, congress, had, no, power, to, collect, taxes, or, to, demand, money, from, the, states, this, lack, of, a, stable, source, of, funding, had, made, it, difficult, for, the, continental, army, both, to, obtain, its, necessary, provisions, and, to, pay, its, soldiers, during, the, war, and, for, some, time, after, congress, obtained, what, funds, it, could, from, subsidies, from, the, king, of, france, european, loans, and, aid, requested, from, the, several, states, which, were, often, unable, or, unwilling, to, contribute, an, amendment, to, the, articles, had, been, proposed, by, thomas, burke, in, february, 1781, to, give, congress, the, power, to, collect, a, five, percent, impost, or, duty, on, all, imports, but, this, required, ratification, by, all, states, securing, its, passage, as, law, proved, impossible, after, it, was, rejected, by, rhode, island, in, november, 1782, james, madison, joined, hamilton, in, influencing, congress, to, send, a, delegation, to, persuade, rhode, island, to, change, its, mind, their, report, recommending, the, delegation, argued, the, national, government, needed, not, just, some, level, of, financial, autonomy, but, also, the, ability, to, make, laws, that, superseded, those, of, the, individual, states, hamilton, transmitted, a, letter, arguing, that, congress, already, had, the, power, to, tax, since, it, had, the, power, to, fix, the, sums, due, from, the, several, states, but, virginia, s, rescission, of, its, own, ratification, of, this, amendment, ended, the, rhode, island, negotiations, while, hamilton, was, in, congress, discontented, soldiers, began, to, pose, a, danger, to, the, young, united, states, most, of, the, army, was, then, posted, at, newburgh, new, york, those, in, the, army, were, funding, much, of, their, own, supplies, and, they, had, not, been, paid, in, eight, months, furthermore, after, valley, forge, the, continental, officers, had, been, promised, in, may, 1778, a, pension, of, half, their, pay, when, they, were, discharged, by, the, early, 1780s, due, to, the, structure, of, the, government, under, the, articles, of, confederation, it, had, no, power, to, tax, to, either, raise, revenue, or, pay, its, soldiers, in, 1782, after, several, months, without, pay, a, group, of, officers, organized, to, send, a, delegation, to, lobby, congress, led, by, captain, alexander, mcdougall, the, officers, had, three, demands, the, army, s, pay, their, own, pensions, and, commutation, of, those, pensions, into, a, lump, sum, payment, if, congress, were, unable, to, afford, the, half, salary, pensions, for, life, congress, rejected, the, proposal, several, congressmen, including, hamilton, robert, morris, and, gouverneur, morris, attempted, to, use, the, so, called, newburgh, conspiracy, as, leverage, to, secure, support, from, the, states, and, in, congress, for, funding, of, the, national, government, they, encouraged, macdougall, to, continue, his, aggressive, approach, implying, unknown, consequences, if, their, demands, were, not, met, and, defeated, proposals, designed, to, end, the, crisis, without, establishing, general, taxation, that, the, states, assume, the, debt, to, the, army, or, that, an, impost, be, established, dedicated, to, the, sole, purpose, of, paying, that, debt, hamilton, suggested, using, the, army, s, claims, to, prevail, upon, the, states, for, the, proposed, national, funding, system, the, morrises, and, hamilton, contacted, general, henry, knox, to, suggest, he, and, the, officers, defy, civil, authority, at, least, by, not, disbanding, if, the, army, were, not, satisfied, hamilton, wrote, washington, to, suggest, that, hamilton, covertly, take, direction, of, the, officers, efforts, to, secure, redress, to, secure, continental, funding, but, keep, the, army, within, the, limits, of, moderation, washington, wrote, hamilton, back, declining, to, introduce, the, army, after, the, crisis, had, ended, washington, warned, of, the, dangers, of, using, the, army, as, leverage, to, gain, support, for, the, national, funding, plan, on, march, 15, washington, defused, the, newburgh, situation, by, addressing, the, officers, personally, congress, ordered, the, army, officially, disbanded, in, april, 1783, in, the, same, month, congress, passed, a, new, measure, for, a, 25, year, impost, which, hamilton, voted, against, that, again, required, the, consent, of, all, the, states, it, also, approved, a, commutation, of, the, officers, pensions, to, five, years, of, full, pay, rhode, island, again, opposed, these, provisions, and, hamilton, s, robust, assertions, of, national, prerogatives, in, his, previous, letter, were, widely, held, to, be, excessive, in, june, 1783, a, different, group, of, disgruntled, soldiers, from, lancaster, pennsylvania, sent, congress, a, petition, demanding, their, back, pay, when, they, began, to, march, toward, philadelphia, congress, charged, hamilton, and, two, others, with, intercepting, the, mob, hamilton, requested, militia, from, pennsylvania, s, supreme, executive, council, but, was, turned, down, hamilton, instructed, assistant, secretary, of, war, william, jackson, to, intercept, the, men, jackson, was, unsuccessful, the, mob, arrived, in, philadelphia, and, the, soldiers, proceeded, to, harangue, congress, for, their, pay, hamilton, argued, that, congress, ought, to, adjourn, to, princeton, new, jersey, congress, agreed, and, relocated, there, frustrated, with, the, weakness, of, the, central, government, hamilton, while, in, princeton, drafted, a, call, to, revise, the, articles, of, confederation, this, resolution, contained, many, features, of, the, future, constitution, of, the, united, states, including, a, strong, federal, government, with, the, ability, to, collect, taxes, and, raise, an, army, it, also, included, the, separation, of, powers, into, the, legislative, executive, and, judicial, branches, hamilton, resigned, from, congress, in, 1783, when, the, british, left, new, york, in, 1783, he, practiced, there, in, partnership, with, richard, harison, he, specialized, in, defending, tories, and, british, subjects, as, in, rutgers, v, waddington, in, which, he, defeated, a, claim, for, damages, done, to, a, brewery, by, the, englishmen, who, held, it, during, the, military, occupation, of, new, york, he, pleaded, for, the, mayor, s, court, to, interpret, state, law, consistent, with, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, which, had, ended, the, revolutionary, war, 64, 69, in, 1784, hamilton, founded, the, bank, of, new, york, long, dissatisfied, with, the, articles, of, confederation, as, too, weak, to, be, effective, hamilton, played, a, major, leadership, role, at, the, 1786, annapolis, convention, he, drafted, its, resolution, for, a, constitutional, convention, and, in, doing, so, brought, one, step, closer, to, reality, his, longtime, desire, to, have, a, more, effectual, more, financially, self, sufficient, federal, government, as, a, member, of, the, legislature, of, new, york, hamilton, argued, forcefully, and, at, length, in, favor, of, a, bill, to, recognize, the, sovereignty, of, the, state, of, vermont, against, numerous, objections, to, its, constitutionality, and, policy, consideration, of, the, bill, was, deferred, to, a, later, date, from, 1787, to, 1789, hamilton, exchanged, letters, with, nathaniel, chipman, a, lawyer, representing, vermont, after, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, went, into, effect, hamilton, said, one, of, the, first, subjects, of, deliberation, with, the, new, congress, will, be, the, independence, of, kentucky, for, which, the, southern, states, will, be, anxious, the, northern, will, be, glad, to, send, a, counterpoise, in, vermont, vermont, was, admitted, to, the, union, in, 1791, in, 1788, he, was, awarded, a, master, of, arts, degree, from, his, alma, mater, the, former, king, s, college, now, reconstituted, as, columbia, college, it, was, during, this, post, war, period, that, hamilton, served, on, the, college, s, board, of, trustees, playing, a, part, in, the, reopening, of, the, college, and, placing, it, on, firm, financial, footing, in, 1787, hamilton, served, as, assemblyman, from, new, york, county, in, the, new, york, state, legislature, and, was, chosen, as, a, delegate, at, the, constitutional, convention, in, philadelphia, by, his, father, in, law, philip, schuyler, 191, even, though, hamilton, had, been, a, leader, in, calling, for, a, new, constitutional, convention, his, direct, influence, at, the, convention, itself, was, quite, limited, governor, george, clinton, s, faction, in, the, new, york, legislature, had, chosen, new, york, s, other, two, delegates, john, lansing, jr, and, robert, yates, and, both, of, them, opposed, hamilton, s, goal, of, a, strong, national, government, thus, whenever, the, other, two, members, of, the, new, york, delegation, were, present, they, decided, new, york, s, vote, to, ensure, that, there, were, no, major, alterations, to, the, articles, of, confederation, 195, early, in, the, convention, hamilton, made, a, speech, proposing, a, president, for, life, it, had, no, effect, upon, the, deliberations, of, the, convention, he, proposed, to, have, an, elected, president, and, elected, senators, who, would, serve, for, life, contingent, upon, good, behavior, and, subject, to, removal, for, corruption, or, abuse, this, idea, contributed, later, to, the, hostile, view, of, hamilton, as, a, monarchist, sympathizer, held, by, james, madison, according, to, madison, s, notes, hamilton, said, in, regards, to, the, executive, the, english, model, was, the, only, good, one, on, this, subject, the, hereditary, interest, of, the, king, was, so, interwoven, with, that, of, the, nation, and, his, personal, emoluments, so, great, that, he, was, placed, above, the, danger, of, being, corrupted, from, abroad, let, one, executive, be, appointed, for, life, who, dares, execute, his, powers, hamilton, argued, and, let, me, observe, that, an, executive, is, less, dangerous, to, the, liberties, of, the, people, when, in, office, during, life, than, for, seven, years, it, may, be, said, this, constitutes, as, an, elective, monarchy, but, by, making, the, executive, subject, to, impeachment, the, term, monarchy, cannot, apply, in, his, notes, of, the, convention, madison, interpreted, hamilton, s, proposal, as, claiming, power, for, the, rich, and, well, born, madison, s, perspective, all, but, isolated, hamilton, from, his, fellow, delegates, and, others, who, felt, they, did, not, reflect, the, ideas, of, revolution, and, liberty, during, the, convention, hamilton, constructed, a, draft, for, the, constitution, based, on, the, convention, debates, but, he, never, presented, it, this, draft, had, most, of, the, features, of, the, actual, constitution, in, this, draft, the, senate, was, to, be, elected, in, proportion, to, the, population, being, two, fifths, the, size, of, the, house, and, the, president, and, senators, were, to, be, elected, through, complex, multistage, elections, in, which, chosen, electors, would, elect, smaller, bodies, of, electors, they, would, hold, office, for, life, but, were, removable, for, misconduct, the, president, would, have, an, absolute, veto, the, supreme, court, was, to, have, immediate, jurisdiction, over, all, lawsuits, involving, the, united, states, and, state, governors, were, to, be, appointed, by, the, federal, government, at, the, end, of, the, convention, hamilton, was, still, not, content, with, the, final, constitution, but, signed, it, anyway, as, a, vast, improvement, over, the, articles, of, confederation, and, urged, his, fellow, delegates, to, do, so, also, since, the, other, two, members, of, the, new, york, delegation, lansing, and, yates, had, already, withdrawn, hamilton, was, the, only, new, york, signer, to, the, united, states, constitution, 206, he, then, took, a, highly, active, part, in, the, successful, campaign, for, the, document, s, ratification, in, new, york, in, 1788, which, was, a, crucial, step, in, its, national, ratification, he, first, used, the, popularity, of, the, constitution, by, the, masses, to, compel, george, clinton, to, sign, but, was, unsuccessful, the, state, convention, in, poughkeepsie, in, june, 1788, pitted, hamilton, jay, james, duane, robert, livingston, and, richard, morris, against, the, clintonian, faction, led, by, melancton, smith, lansing, yates, and, gilbert, livingston, clinton, s, faction, wanted, to, amend, the, constitution, while, maintaining, the, state, s, right, to, secede, if, their, attempts, failed, and, members, of, hamilton, s, faction, were, against, any, conditional, ratification, under, the, impression, that, new, york, would, not, be, accepted, into, the, union, during, the, state, convention, new, hampshire, and, virginia, becoming, the, ninth, and, tenth, states, to, ratify, the, constitution, respectively, had, ensured, any, adjournment, would, not, happen, and, a, compromise, would, have, to, be, reached, hamilton, s, arguments, used, for, the, ratifications, were, largely, iterations, of, work, from, the, federalist, papers, and, smith, eventually, went, for, ratification, though, it, was, more, out, of, necessity, than, hamilton, s, rhetoric, the, vote, in, the, state, convention, was, ratified, 30, to, 27, on, july, 26, 1788, hamilton, recruited, john, jay, and, james, madison, to, write, the, federalist, papers, a, series, of, essays, to, defend, the, proposed, constitution, he, made, the, largest, contribution, to, that, effort, writing, 51, of, the, 85, essays, published, hamilton, supervised, the, entire, project, enlisted, the, participants, wrote, the, majority, of, the, essays, and, oversaw, the, publication, during, the, project, each, person, was, responsible, for, their, areas, of, expertise, jay, covered, foreign, relations, madison, covered, the, history, of, republics, and, confederacies, along, with, the, anatomy, of, the, new, government, hamilton, covered, the, branches, of, government, most, pertinent, to, him, the, executive, and, judicial, branches, with, some, aspects, of, the, senate, as, well, as, covering, military, matters, and, taxation, the, papers, first, appeared, in, the, independent, journal, on, october, 27, 1787, hamilton, wrote, the, first, paper, signed, as, publius, and, all, of, the, subsequent, papers, were, signed, under, the, name, 210, jay, wrote, the, next, four, papers, to, elaborate, on, the, confederation, s, weakness, and, the, need, for, unity, against, foreign, aggression, and, against, splitting, into, rival, confederacies, and, except, for, no, 64, was, not, further, involved, 211, hamilton, s, highlights, included, discussion, that, although, republics, have, been, culpable, for, disorders, in, the, past, advances, in, the, science, of, politics, had, fostered, principles, that, ensured, that, those, abuses, could, be, prevented, such, as, the, division, of, powers, legislative, checks, and, balances, an, independent, judiciary, and, legislators, that, were, represented, by, electors, no, 7, 9, hamilton, also, wrote, an, extensive, defense, of, the, constitution, no, 23, 36, and, discussed, the, senate, and, executive, and, judicial, branches, no, 65, 85, hamilton, and, madison, worked, to, describe, the, anarchic, state, of, the, confederation, no, 15, 22, and, the, two, have, been, described, as, not, being, significantly, different, in, thought, during, this, time, period, in, contrast, to, their, stark, opposition, later, in, life, subtle, differences, appeared, with, the, two, when, discussing, the, necessity, of, standing, armies, before, the, adjournment, of, the, house, in, september, 1789, they, requested, hamilton, to, make, a, report, on, suggestions, to, improve, the, public, credit, by, january, 1790, hamilton, had, written, to, robert, morris, as, early, as, 1781, that, fixing, the, public, credit, will, win, their, objective, of, independence, the, sources, that, hamilton, used, ranged, from, frenchmen, such, as, jacques, necker, and, montesquieu, to, british, writers, such, as, hume, hobbes, and, malachy, postlethwayt, while, writing, the, report, he, also, sought, out, suggestions, from, contemporaries, such, as, john, witherspoon, and, madison, although, they, agreed, on, additional, taxes, such, as, distilleries, and, duties, on, imported, liquors, and, land, taxes, madison, feared, that, the, securities, from, the, government, debt, would, fall, into, foreign, hands, 244, 45, in, the, report, hamilton, felt, that, the, securities, should, be, paid, at, full, value, to, their, legitimate, owners, including, those, who, took, the, financial, risk, of, buying, government, bonds, that, most, experts, thought, would, never, be, redeemed, he, argued, that, liberty, and, property, security, were, inseparable, and, that, the, government, should, honor, the, contracts, as, they, formed, the, basis, of, public, and, private, morality, to, hamilton, the, proper, handling, of, the, government, debt, would, also, allow, america, to, borrow, at, affordable, interest, rates, and, would, also, be, a, stimulant, to, the, economy, hamilton, divided, the, debt, into, national, and, state, and, further, divided, the, national, debt, into, foreign, and, domestic, debt, while, there, was, agreement, on, how, to, handle, the, foreign, debt, especially, with, france, there, was, not, with, regards, to, the, national, debt, held, by, domestic, creditors, during, the, revolutionary, war, affluent, citizens, had, invested, in, bonds, and, war, veterans, had, been, paid, with, promissory, notes, and, ious, that, plummeted, in, price, during, the, confederation, in, response, the, war, veterans, sold, the, securities, to, speculators, for, as, little, as, fifteen, to, twenty, cents, on, the, dollar, hamilton, felt, the, money, from, the, bonds, should, not, go, to, the, soldiers, who, had, shown, little, faith, in, the, country, s, future, but, the, speculators, that, had, bought, the, bonds, from, the, soldiers, the, process, of, attempting, to, track, down, the, original, bondholders, along, with, the, government, showing, discrimination, among, the, classes, of, holders, if, the, war, veterans, were, to, be, compensated, also, weighed, in, as, factors, for, hamilton, as, for, the, state, debts, hamilton, suggested, consolidating, them, with, the, national, debt, and, label, it, as, federal, debt, for, the, sake, of, efficiency, on, a, national, scale, the, last, portion, of, the, report, dealt, with, eliminating, the, debt, by, utilizing, a, sinking, fund, that, would, retire, five, percent, of, the, debt, annually, until, it, was, paid, off, due, to, the, bonds, being, traded, well, below, their, face, value, the, purchases, would, benefit, the, government, as, the, securities, rose, in, price, 300, when, the, report, was, submitted, to, the, house, of, representatives, detractors, soon, began, to, speak, against, it, some, of, the, negative, views, expressed, in, the, house, were, that, the, notion, of, programs, that, resembled, british, practice, were, wicked, and, that, the, balance, of, power, would, be, shifted, away, from, the, representatives, to, the, executive, branch, william, maclay, suspected, that, several, congressmen, were, involved, in, government, securities, seeing, congress, in, an, unholy, league, with, new, york, speculators, 302, congressman, james, jackson, also, spoke, against, new, york, with, allegations, of, speculators, attempting, to, swindle, those, who, had, not, yet, heard, about, hamilton, s, report, 303, the, involvement, of, those, in, hamilton, s, circle, such, as, schuyler, william, duer, james, duane, gouverneur, morris, and, rufus, king, as, speculators, was, not, favorable, to, those, against, the, report, either, though, hamilton, personally, did, not, own, or, deal, a, share, in, the, debt, 304, 250, madison, eventually, spoke, against, it, by, february, 1790, although, he, was, not, against, current, holders, of, government, debt, to, profit, he, wanted, the, windfall, to, go, to, the, original, holders, madison, did, not, feel, that, the, original, holders, had, lost, faith, in, the, government, but, sold, their, securities, out, of, desperation, 305, the, compromise, was, seen, as, egregious, to, both, hamiltonians, and, their, dissidents, such, as, maclay, and, madison, s, vote, was, defeated, 36, votes, to, 13, on, february, 22, 305, 255, the, fight, for, the, national, government, to, assume, state, debt, was, a, longer, issue, and, lasted, over, four, months, during, the, period, the, resources, that, hamilton, was, to, apply, to, the, payment, of, state, debts, was, requested, by, alexander, white, and, was, rejected, due, to, hamilton, s, not, being, able, to, prepare, information, by, march, 3, and, was, even, postponed, by, his, own, supporters, in, spite, of, configuring, a, report, the, next, day, which, consisted, of, a, series, of, additional, duties, to, meet, the, interest, on, the, state, debts, 297, 98, duer, resigned, as, assistant, secretary, of, the, treasury, and, the, vote, of, assumption, was, voted, down, 31, votes, to, 29, on, april, 12, 258, 59, during, this, period, hamilton, bypassed, the, rising, issue, of, slavery, in, congress, after, quakers, petitioned, for, its, abolition, returning, to, the, issue, the, following, year, another, issue, in, which, hamilton, played, a, role, was, the, temporary, location, of, the, capital, from, new, york, city, tench, coxe, was, sent, to, speak, to, maclay, to, bargain, about, the, capital, being, temporarily, located, to, philadelphia, as, a, single, vote, in, the, senate, was, needed, and, five, in, the, house, for, the, bill, to, pass, 263, thomas, jefferson, wrote, years, afterward, that, hamilton, had, a, discussion, with, him, around, this, time, period, about, the, capital, of, the, united, states, being, relocated, to, virginia, by, means, of, a, pill, that, would, be, peculiarly, bitter, to, the, southern, states, and, that, some, concomitant, measure, should, be, adopted, to, sweeten, it, a, little, to, them, 263, the, bill, passed, in, the, senate, on, july, 21, and, in, the, house, 34, votes, to, 28, on, july, 26, 1790, 263, hamilton, s, report, on, a, national, bank, was, a, projection, from, the, first, report, on, the, public, credit, although, hamilton, had, been, forming, ideas, of, a, national, bank, as, early, as, 1779, 268, he, had, gathered, ideas, in, various, ways, over, the, past, eleven, years, these, included, theories, from, adam, smith, extensive, studies, on, the, bank, of, england, the, blunders, of, the, bank, of, north, america, and, his, experience, in, establishing, the, bank, of, new, york, he, also, used, american, records, from, james, wilson, pelatiah, webster, gouverneur, morris, and, from, his, assistant, treasury, secretary, tench, coxe, he, thought, that, this, plan, for, a, national, bank, could, help, in, any, sort, of, financial, crisis, hamilton, suggested, that, congress, should, charter, the, national, bank, with, a, capitalization, of, 10, million, one, fifth, of, which, would, be, handled, by, the, government, since, the, government, did, not, have, the, money, it, would, borrow, the, money, from, the, bank, itself, and, repay, the, loan, in, ten, even, annual, installments, 194, the, rest, was, to, be, available, to, individual, investors, the, bank, was, to, be, governed, by, a, twenty, five, member, board, of, directors, that, was, to, represent, a, large, majority, of, the, private, shareholders, which, hamilton, considered, essential, for, his, being, under, a, private, direction, 268, hamilton, s, bank, model, had, many, similarities, to, that, of, the, bank, of, england, except, hamilton, wanted, to, exclude, the, government, from, being, involved, in, public, debt, but, provide, a, large, firm, and, elastic, money, supply, for, the, functioning, of, normal, businesses, and, usual, economic, development, among, other, differences, 194, 95, the, tax, revenue, to, initiate, the, bank, was, the, same, as, he, had, previously, proposed, increases, on, imported, spirits, rum, liquor, and, whiskey, 195, 96, the, bill, passed, through, the, senate, practically, without, a, problem, but, objections, to, the, proposal, increased, by, the, time, it, reached, the, house, of, representatives, it, was, generally, held, by, critics, that, hamilton, was, serving, the, interests, of, the, northeast, by, means, of, the, bank, and, those, of, the, agrarian, lifestyle, would, not, benefit, from, it, 270, among, those, critics, was, james, jackson, of, georgia, who, also, attempted, to, refute, the, report, by, quoting, from, the, federalist, papers, 270, madison, and, jefferson, also, opposed, the, bank, bill, the, potential, of, the, capital, not, being, moved, to, the, potomac, if, the, bank, was, to, have, a, firm, establishment, in, philadelphia, was, a, more, significant, reason, and, actions, that, pennsylvania, members, of, congress, took, to, keep, the, capital, there, made, both, men, anxious, 199, 200, the, whiskey, rebellion, also, showed, how, in, other, financial, plans, there, was, a, distance, between, the, classes, as, the, wealthy, profited, from, the, taxes, madison, warned, the, pennsylvania, congress, members, that, he, would, attack, the, bill, as, unconstitutional, in, the, house, and, followed, up, on, his, threat, 200, madison, argued, his, case, of, where, the, power, of, a, bank, could, be, established, within, the, constitution, but, he, failed, to, sway, members, of, the, house, and, his, authority, on, the, constitution, was, questioned, by, a, few, members, 200, 01, the, bill, eventually, passed, in, an, overwhelming, fashion, 39, to, 20, on, february, 8, 1791, 271, washington, hesitated, to, sign, the, bill, as, he, received, suggestions, from, attorney, general, edmund, randolph, and, thomas, jefferson, jefferson, dismissed, the, necessary, and, proper, clause, as, reasoning, for, the, creation, of, a, national, bank, stating, that, the, enumerated, powers, can, all, be, carried, into, execution, without, a, bank, 271, 72, along, with, randolph, and, jefferson, s, objections, washington, s, involvement, in, the, movement, of, the, capital, from, philadelphia, is, also, thought, to, be, a, reason, for, his, hesitation, 202, 03, in, response, to, the, objection, of, the, clause, hamilton, stated, that, necessary, often, means, no, more, than, needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or, conductive, to, and, the, bank, was, a, convenient, species, of, medium, in, which, are, to, be, paid, 272, 73, washington, would, eventually, sign, the, bill, into, law, 272, 73, in, 1791, hamilton, submitted, the, report, on, the, establishment, of, a, mint, to, the, house, of, representatives, many, of, hamilton, s, ideas, for, this, report, were, from, european, economists, resolutions, from, the, 1785, and, 1786, continental, congress, meetings, and, people, such, as, robert, morris, gouverneur, morris, and, thomas, jefferson, 197, because, the, most, circulated, coins, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, were, spanish, currency, hamilton, proposed, that, minting, a, united, states, dollar, weighing, almost, as, much, as, the, spanish, peso, would, be, the, simplest, way, to, introduce, a, national, currency, hamilton, differed, from, european, monetary, policymakers, in, his, desire, to, overprice, gold, relative, to, silver, on, the, grounds, that, the, united, states, would, always, receive, an, influx, of, silver, from, the, west, indies, 197, despite, his, own, preference, for, a, monometallic, gold, standard, he, ultimately, issued, a, bimetallic, currency, at, a, fixed, 15, 1, ratio, of, silver, to, gold, 197, hamilton, proposed, that, the, u, s, dollar, should, have, fractional, coins, using, decimals, rather, than, eighths, like, the, spanish, coinage, this, innovation, was, originally, suggested, by, superintendent, of, finance, robert, morris, with, whom, hamilton, corresponded, after, examining, one, of, morris, s, nova, constellatio, coins, in, 1783, he, also, desired, the, minting, of, small, value, coins, such, as, silver, ten, cent, and, copper, cent, and, half, cent, pieces, for, reducing, the, cost, of, living, for, the, poor, 198, one, of, his, main, objectives, was, for, the, general, public, to, become, accustomed, to, handling, money, on, a, frequent, basis, 198, by, 1792, hamilton, s, principles, were, adopted, by, congress, resulting, in, the, coinage, act, of, 1792, and, the, creation, of, the, mint, there, was, to, be, a, ten, dollar, gold, eagle, coin, a, silver, dollar, and, fractional, money, ranging, from, one, half, to, fifty, cents, the, coining, of, silver, and, gold, was, issued, by, 1795, smuggling, off, american, coasts, was, an, issue, before, the, revolutionary, war, and, after, the, revolution, it, was, more, problematic, along, with, smuggling, lack, of, shipping, control, pirating, and, a, revenue, unbalance, were, also, major, problems, in, response, hamilton, proposed, to, congress, to, enact, a, naval, police, force, called, revenue, cutters, in, order, to, patrol, the, waters, and, assist, the, custom, collectors, with, confiscating, contraband, this, idea, was, also, proposed, to, assist, in, tariff, controlling, boosting, the, american, economy, and, promote, the, merchant, marine, it, is, thought, that, his, experience, obtained, during, his, apprenticeship, with, nicholas, kruger, was, influential, in, his, decision, making, concerning, some, of, the, details, of, the, system, of, cutters, hamilton, wanted, the, first, ten, cutters, in, different, areas, in, the, united, states, from, new, england, to, georgia, each, of, those, cutters, was, to, be, armed, with, ten, muskets, and, bayonets, twenty, pistols, two, chisels, one, broad, ax, and, two, lanterns, the, fabric, of, the, sails, was, to, be, domestically, manufactured, and, provisions, were, made, for, the, employees, food, supply, and, etiquette, when, boarding, ships, congress, established, the, revenue, cutter, service, on, august, 4, 1790, which, is, viewed, as, the, birth, of, the, united, states, coast, guard, one, of, the, principal, sources, of, revenue, hamilton, prevailed, upon, congress, to, approve, was, an, excise, tax, on, whiskey, in, his, first, tariff, bill, in, january, 1790, hamilton, proposed, to, raise, the, three, million, dollars, needed, to, pay, for, government, operating, expenses, and, interest, on, domestic, and, foreign, debts, by, means, of, an, increase, on, duties, on, imported, wines, distilled, spirits, tea, coffee, and, domestic, spirits, it, failed, with, congress, complying, with, most, recommendations, excluding, the, excise, tax, on, whiskey, the, same, year, madison, modified, hamilton, s, tariff, to, involve, only, imported, duties, it, was, passed, in, september, in, response, of, diversifying, revenues, as, three, fourths, of, revenue, gathered, was, from, commerce, with, great, britain, hamilton, attempted, once, again, during, his, report, on, public, credit, when, presenting, it, in, 1790, to, implement, an, excise, tax, on, both, imported, and, domestic, spirits, the, taxation, rate, was, graduated, in, proportion, to, the, whiskey, proof, and, hamilton, intended, to, equalize, the, tax, burden, on, imported, spirits, with, imported, and, domestic, liquor, in, lieu, of, the, excise, on, production, citizens, could, pay, 60, cents, by, the, gallon, of, dispensing, capacity, along, with, an, exemption, on, small, stills, used, exclusively, for, domestic, consumption, he, realized, the, loathing, that, the, tax, would, receive, in, rural, areas, but, thought, of, the, taxing, of, spirits, more, reasonable, than, land, taxes, opposition, initially, came, from, pennsylvania, s, house, of, representatives, protesting, the, tax, william, maclay, had, noted, that, not, even, the, pennsylvanian, legislators, had, been, able, to, enforce, excise, taxes, in, the, western, regions, of, the, state, hamilton, was, aware, of, the, potential, difficulties, and, proposed, inspectors, the, ability, to, search, buildings, that, distillers, were, designated, to, store, their, spirits, and, would, be, able, to, search, suspected, illegal, storage, facilities, to, confiscate, contraband, with, a, warrant, although, the, inspectors, were, not, allowed, to, search, houses, and, warehouses, they, were, to, visit, twice, a, day, and, file, weekly, reports, in, extensive, detail, hamilton, cautioned, against, expedited, judicial, means, and, favored, a, jury, trial, with, potential, offenders, as, soon, as, 1791, locals, began, to, shun, or, threaten, inspectors, as, they, felt, the, inspection, methods, were, intrusive, inspectors, were, also, tarred, and, feathered, blindfolded, and, whipped, hamilton, had, attempted, to, appease, the, opposition, with, lowered, tax, rates, but, it, did, not, suffice, strong, opposition, to, the, whiskey, tax, by, cottage, producers, in, remote, rural, regions, erupted, into, the, whiskey, rebellion, in, 1794, in, western, pennsylvania, and, western, virginia, whiskey, was, the, basic, export, product, and, was, fundamental, to, the, local, economy, in, response, to, the, rebellion, believing, compliance, with, the, laws, was, vital, to, the, establishment, of, federal, authority, hamilton, accompanied, to, the, rebellion, s, site, president, washington, general, henry, light, horse, harry, lee, and, more, federal, troops, than, were, ever, assembled, in, one, place, during, the, revolution, this, overwhelming, display, of, force, intimidated, the, leaders, of, the, insurrection, ending, the, rebellion, virtually, without, bloodshed, hamilton, s, next, report, was, his, report, on, manufactures, although, he, was, requested, by, congress, on, january, 15, 1790, for, a, report, for, manufacturing, that, would, expand, the, united, states, independence, the, report, was, not, submitted, until, december, 5, 1791, 274, 277, in, the, report, hamilton, quoted, from, wealth, of, nations, and, used, the, french, physiocrats, as, an, example, for, rejecting, agrarianism, and, the, physiocratic, theory, respectively, 233, hamilton, also, refuted, smith, s, ideas, of, government, noninterference, as, it, would, have, been, detrimental, for, trade, with, other, countries, 244, hamilton, also, thought, that, the, united, states, being, a, primarily, agrarian, country, would, be, at, a, disadvantage, in, dealing, with, europe, in, response, to, the, agrarian, detractors, hamilton, stated, that, the, agriculturists, interest, would, be, advanced, by, manufactures, 276, and, that, agriculture, was, just, as, productive, as, manufacturing, 233, 276, hamilton, argued, that, developing, an, industrial, economy, is, impossible, without, protective, tariffs, among, the, ways, that, the, government, should, assist, manufacturing, hamilton, argued, for, government, assistance, to, infant, industries, so, they, can, achieve, economies, of, scale, by, levying, protective, duties, on, imported, foreign, goods, that, were, also, manufactured, in, the, united, states, for, withdrawing, duties, levied, on, raw, materials, needed, for, domestic, manufacturing, 277, and, pecuniary, boundaries, 277, he, also, called, for, encouraging, immigration, for, people, to, better, themselves, in, similar, employment, opportunities, congress, shelved, the, report, without, much, debate, except, for, madison, s, objection, to, hamilton, s, formulation, of, the, general, welfare, clause, which, hamilton, construed, liberally, as, a, legal, basis, for, his, extensive, programs, in, 1791, hamilton, along, with, coxe, and, several, entrepreneurs, from, new, york, city, and, philadelphia, formed, the, society, for, the, establishment, of, useful, manufactures, a, private, industrial, corporation, in, may, 1792, the, directors, decided, to, examine, the, great, falls, of, the, passaic, river, in, new, jersey, as, a, possible, location, for, a, manufacturing, center, on, july, 4, 1792, the, society, directors, met, philip, schuyler, at, abraham, godwin, s, hotel, on, the, passaic, river, where, they, led, a, tour, prospecting, the, area, for, the, national, manufactory, it, was, originally, suggested, that, they, dig, mile, long, trenches, and, build, the, factories, away, from, the, falls, but, hamilton, argued, that, it, would, be, too, costly, and, laborious, the, location, at, great, falls, of, the, passaic, river, in, new, jersey, was, selected, due, to, access, to, raw, materials, it, being, densely, inhabited, and, having, access, to, water, power, from, the, falls, of, the, passaic, 231, the, factory, town, was, named, paterson, after, new, jersey, s, governor, william, paterson, who, signed, the, charter, 232, the, profits, were, to, derive, from, specific, corporates, rather, than, the, benefits, to, be, conferred, to, the, nation, and, the, citizens, which, was, unlike, the, report, hamilton, also, suggested, the, first, stock, to, be, offered, at, 500, 000, and, to, eventually, increase, to, 1, million, and, welcomed, state, and, federal, government, subscriptions, alike, 280, the, company, was, never, successful, with, numerous, shareholders, reneged, on, stock, payments, and, some, going, bankrupt, william, duer, the, governor, of, the, program, was, sent, to, debtors, prison, where, he, died, in, spite, of, hamilton, s, efforts, to, mend, the, disaster, the, company, folded, when, france, and, britain, went, to, war, in, early, 1793, all, four, members, of, the, cabinet, were, consulted, on, what, to, do, they, and, washington, unanimously, agreed, to, remain, neutral, and, to, have, the, french, ambassador, who, was, raising, privateers, and, mercenaries, on, american, soil, edmond, charles, gen, t, recalled, 336, 41, however, in, 1794, policy, toward, britain, became, a, major, point, of, contention, between, the, two, parties, hamilton, and, the, federalists, wished, for, more, trade, with, britain, the, largest, trading, partner, of, the, newly, formed, united, states, the, republicans, saw, monarchist, britain, as, the, main, threat, to, republicanism, and, proposed, instead, to, start, a, trade, war, 327, 28, to, avoid, war, washington, sent, chief, justice, john, jay, to, negotiate, with, the, british, with, hamilton, largely, writing, jay, s, instructions, the, result, was, a, treaty, denounced, by, the, republicans, but, hamilton, mobilized, support, throughout, the, land, the, jay, treaty, passed, the, senate, in, 1795, by, exactly, the, required, two, thirds, majority, the, treaty, resolved, issues, remaining, from, the, revolution, averted, war, and, made, possible, ten, years, of, peaceful, trade, between, the, united, states, and, britain, ch, 9, historian, george, herring, notes, the, remarkable, and, fortuitous, economic, and, diplomatic, gains, produced, by, the, treaty, several, european, states, had, formed, the, second, league, of, armed, neutrality, against, incursions, on, their, neutral, rights, the, cabinet, was, also, consulted, on, whether, the, united, states, should, join, the, alliance, and, decided, not, to, it, kept, that, decision, secret, but, hamilton, revealed, it, in, private, to, george, hammond, the, british, minister, to, the, united, states, without, telling, jay, or, anyone, else, his, act, remained, unknown, until, hammond, s, dispatches, were, read, in, the, 1920s, this, revelation, may, have, had, limited, effect, on, the, negotiations, jay, did, threaten, to, join, the, league, at, one, point, but, the, british, had, other, reasons, not, to, view, the, alliance, as, a, serious, threat, 411, ff, hamilton, s, wife, suffered, a, miscarriage, while, he, was, absent, during, his, armed, repression, of, the, whiskey, rebellion, in, the, wake, of, this, hamilton, tendered, his, resignation, from, office, on, december, 1, 1794, giving, washington, two, months, notice, before, leaving, his, post, on, january, 31, 1795, hamilton, submitted, the, report, on, a, plan, for, the, further, support, of, public, credit, to, congress, to, curb, the, debt, problem, hamilton, grew, dissatisfied, with, what, he, viewed, as, a, lack, of, a, comprehensive, plan, to, fix, the, public, debt, he, wished, to, have, new, taxes, passed, with, older, ones, made, permanent, and, stated, that, any, surplus, from, the, excise, tax, on, liquor, would, be, pledged, to, lower, public, debt, his, proposals, were, included, in, a, bill, by, congress, within, slightly, over, a, month, after, his, departure, as, treasury, secretary, some, months, later, hamilton, resumed, his, law, practice, in, new, york, to, remain, closer, to, his, family, hamilton, s, vision, was, challenged, by, virginia, agrarians, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, who, formed, the, democratic, republican, party, they, favored, strong, state, governments, based, in, rural, america, and, protected, by, state, militias, as, opposed, to, a, strong, national, government, supported, by, a, national, army, and, navy, they, denounced, hamilton, as, insufficiently, devoted, to, republicanism, too, friendly, toward, corrupt, britain, and, the, monarchy, in, general, and, too, oriented, toward, cities, business, and, banking, the, two, party, system, began, to, emerge, as, political, parties, coalesced, around, competing, interests, a, congressional, caucus, led, by, madison, jefferson, and, william, branch, giles, began, as, an, opposition, group, to, hamilton, s, financial, programs, hamilton, and, his, allies, began, to, call, themselves, the, federalists, hamilton, assembled, a, nationwide, coalition, to, garner, support, for, the, administration, including, the, expansive, financial, programs, hamilton, had, made, administration, policy, and, especially, the, president, s, policy, of, neutrality, in, the, european, war, between, britain, and, france, hamilton, publicly, denounced, french, minister, gen, t, who, commissioned, american, privateers, and, recruited, americans, for, private, militias, to, attack, british, ships, and, colonial, possessions, of, british, allies, eventually, even, jefferson, joined, hamilton, in, seeking, gen, t, s, recall, if, hamilton, s, administrative, republic, was, to, succeed, americans, had, to, see, themselves, first, as, citizens, of, a, nation, and, experience, an, administration, that, proved, firm, and, demonstrated, the, concepts, found, within, the, constitution, the, federalists, did, impose, some, internal, direct, taxes, but, they, departed, from, most, implications, of, hamilton, s, administrative, republic, as, risky, the, republicans, opposed, banks, and, cities, and, favored, the, series, of, unstable, revolutionary, governments, in, france, they, built, their, own, national, coalition, to, oppose, the, federalists, both, sides, gained, the, support, of, local, political, factions, and, each, side, developed, its, own, partisan, newspapers, noah, webster, john, fenno, and, william, cobbett, were, energetic, editors, for, the, federalists, while, benjamin, franklin, bache, and, philip, freneau, were, fiery, republican, editors, all, of, their, newspapers, were, characterized, by, intense, personal, attacks, major, exaggerations, and, invented, claims, in, 1801, hamilton, established, a, daily, newspaper, the, new, york, evening, post, and, brought, in, william, coleman, as, its, editor, hamilton, s, and, jefferson, s, incompatibility, was, heightened, by, the, unavowed, wish, of, each, to, be, washington, s, principal, and, most, trusted, advisor, an, additional, partisan, irritant, to, hamilton, was, the, 1791, united, states, senate, election, in, new, york, which, resulted, in, the, election, of, democratic, republican, candidate, aaron, burr, over, federalist, candidate, philip, schuyler, the, incumbent, and, hamilton, s, father, in, law, hamilton, blamed, burr, personally, for, this, outcome, and, negative, characterizations, of, burr, began, to, appear, in, his, correspondence, thereafter, the, two, men, did, work, together, from, time, to, time, thereafter, on, various, projects, including, hamilton, s, army, of, 1798, and, the, manhattan, water, company, hamilton, s, resignation, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, in, 1795, did, not, remove, him, from, public, life, with, the, resumption, of, his, law, practice, he, remained, close, to, washington, as, an, advisor, and, friend, hamilton, influenced, washington, in, the, composition, of, his, farewell, address, by, writing, drafts, for, washington, to, compare, with, the, latter, s, draft, although, when, washington, contemplated, retirement, in, 1792, he, had, consulted, madison, for, a, draft, that, was, used, in, a, similar, manner, to, hamilton, s, in, the, election, of, 1796, under, the, constitution, as, it, stood, then, each, of, the, presidential, electors, had, two, votes, which, they, were, to, cast, for, different, men, from, different, states, the, one, who, received, the, most, votes, would, become, president, the, second, most, vice, president, this, system, was, not, designed, with, the, operation, of, parties, in, mind, as, they, had, been, thought, disreputable, and, factious, the, federalists, planned, to, deal, with, this, by, having, all, their, electors, vote, for, john, adams, then, vice, president, and, all, but, a, few, for, thomas, pinckney, adams, resented, hamilton, s, influence, with, washington, and, considered, him, overambitious, and, scandalous, in, his, private, life, hamilton, compared, adams, unfavorably, with, washington, and, thought, him, too, emotionally, unstable, to, be, president, hamilton, took, the, election, as, an, opportunity, he, urged, all, the, northern, electors, to, vote, for, adams, and, pinckney, lest, jefferson, get, in, but, he, cooperated, with, edward, rutledge, to, have, south, carolina, s, electors, vote, for, jefferson, and, pinckney, if, all, this, worked, pinckney, would, have, more, votes, than, adams, pinckney, would, become, president, and, adams, would, remain, vice, president, but, it, did, not, work, the, federalists, found, out, about, it, and, northern, federalists, voted, for, adams, but, not, for, pinckney, in, sufficient, numbers, that, pinckney, came, in, third, and, jefferson, became, vice, president, adams, resented, the, intrigue, since, he, felt, his, service, to, the, nation, was, much, more, extensive, than, pinckney, s, in, the, summer, of, 1797, hamilton, became, the, first, major, american, politician, publicly, involved, in, a, sex, scandal, six, years, earlier, in, the, summer, of, 1791, 34, year, old, hamilton, became, involved, in, an, affair, with, 23, year, old, maria, reynolds, according, to, hamilton, s, account, maria, approached, him, at, his, house, in, philadelphia, claiming, that, her, husband, james, reynolds, was, abusive, and, had, abandoned, her, and, she, wished, to, return, to, her, relatives, in, new, york, but, lacked, the, means, 366, 69, hamilton, recorded, her, address, and, subsequently, delivered, 30, personally, to, her, boarding, house, where, she, led, him, into, her, bedroom, and, some, conversation, ensued, from, which, it, was, quickly, apparent, that, other, than, pecuniary, consolation, would, be, acceptable, the, two, began, an, intermittent, illicit, affair, that, lasted, approximately, until, june, 1792, over, the, course, of, that, year, while, the, affair, was, taking, place, james, reynolds, was, well, aware, of, his, wife, s, infidelity, and, likely, orchestrated, it, from, the, beginning, he, continually, supported, their, relationship, to, extort, blackmail, money, regularly, from, hamilton, the, common, practice, of, the, day, for, men, of, equal, social, standing, was, for, the, wronged, husband, to, seek, retribution, in, a, duel, but, reynolds, of, a, lower, social, status, and, realizing, how, much, hamilton, had, to, lose, if, his, activity, came, into, public, view, resorted, to, extortion, after, an, initial, request, of, 1, 000, to, which, hamilton, complied, reynolds, invited, hamilton, to, renew, his, visits, to, his, wife, as, a, friend, only, to, extort, forced, loans, after, each, visit, that, most, likely, in, collusion, maria, solicited, with, her, letters, in, the, end, the, blackmail, payments, totaled, over, 1, 300, including, the, initial, extortion, 369, hamilton, at, this, point, may, have, been, aware, of, both, spouses, being, involved, in, the, blackmail, and, he, welcomed, and, strictly, complied, with, james, reynolds, eventual, request, to, end, the, affair, in, november, 1792, james, reynolds, and, his, associate, jacob, clingman, were, arrested, for, counterfeiting, and, speculating, in, revolutionary, war, veterans, unpaid, back, wages, clingman, was, released, on, bail, and, relayed, information, to, democratic, republican, congressman, james, monroe, that, reynolds, had, evidence, incriminating, hamilton, in, illicit, activity, as, treasury, secretary, monroe, consulted, with, congressmen, muhlenberg, and, venable, on, what, actions, to, take, and, the, congressmen, confronted, hamilton, on, december, 15, 1792, hamilton, refuted, the, suspicions, of, financial, speculation, by, exposing, his, affair, with, maria, and, producing, as, evidence, the, letters, by, both, of, the, reynolds, proving, that, his, payments, to, james, reynolds, related, to, blackmail, over, his, adultery, and, not, to, treasury, misconduct, the, trio, agreed, on, their, honor, to, keep, the, documents, privately, with, the, utmost, confidence, 366, 69, five, years, later, however, in, the, summer, of, 1797, the, notoriously, scurrilous, journalist, james, t, callender, published, a, history, of, the, united, states, for, the, year, 1796, 334, the, pamphlet, contained, accusations, based, on, documents, from, the, confrontation, of, december, 15, 1792, taken, out, of, context, that, james, reynolds, had, been, an, agent, of, hamilton, on, july, 5, 1797, hamilton, wrote, to, monroe, muhlenberg, and, venable, asking, them, to, confirm, that, there, was, nothing, that, would, damage, the, perception, of, his, integrity, while, secretary, of, treasury, all, but, monroe, complied, with, hamilton, s, request, hamilton, then, published, a, 100, page, booklet, later, usually, referred, to, as, the, reynolds, pamphlet, and, discussed, the, affair, in, indelicate, detail, for, the, time, hamilton, s, wife, elizabeth, eventually, forgave, him, but, never, forgave, monroe, although, hamilton, faced, ridicule, from, the, democratic, republican, faction, he, maintained, his, availability, for, public, service, 334, 36, during, the, military, build, up, of, the, quasi, war, with, france, and, with, the, strong, endorsement, of, washington, adams, reluctantly, appointed, hamilton, a, major, general, of, the, army, at, washington, s, insistence, hamilton, was, made, the, senior, major, general, prompting, continental, army, major, general, henry, knox, to, decline, the, appointment, to, serve, as, hamilton, s, junior, believing, it, would, be, degrading, to, serve, beneath, him, hamilton, served, as, inspector, general, of, the, united, states, army, from, july, 18, 1798, to, june, 15, 1800, because, washington, was, unwilling, to, leave, mount, vernon, unless, it, were, to, command, an, army, in, the, field, hamilton, was, the, de, facto, head, of, the, army, to, adams, s, considerable, displeasure, if, full, scale, war, broke, out, with, france, hamilton, argued, that, the, army, should, conquer, the, north, american, colonies, of, france, s, ally, spain, bordering, the, united, states, hamilton, was, prepared, to, march, the, army, through, the, southern, united, states, if, necessary, to, fund, this, army, hamilton, wrote, regularly, to, oliver, wolcott, jr, his, successor, at, the, treasury, representative, william, loughton, smith, and, u, s, senator, theodore, sedgwick, he, urged, them, to, pass, a, direct, tax, to, fund, the, war, smith, resigned, in, july, 1797, as, hamilton, complained, to, him, for, slowness, and, urged, wolcott, to, tax, houses, instead, of, land, the, eventual, program, included, taxes, on, land, houses, and, slaves, calculated, at, different, rates, in, different, states, and, requiring, assessment, of, houses, and, a, stamp, act, like, that, of, the, british, before, the, revolution, though, this, time, americans, were, taxing, themselves, through, their, own, representatives, this, provoked, resistance, in, southeastern, pennsylvania, nevertheless, led, primarily, by, men, such, as, john, fries, who, had, marched, with, washington, against, the, whiskey, rebellion, hamilton, aided, in, all, areas, of, the, army, s, development, and, after, washington, s, death, he, was, by, default, the, senior, officer, of, the, united, states, army, from, december, 14, 1799, to, june, 15, 1800, the, army, was, to, guard, against, invasion, from, france, adams, however, derailed, all, plans, for, war, by, opening, negotiations, with, france, that, led, to, peace, there, was, no, longer, a, direct, threat, for, the, army, hamilton, was, commanding, to, respond, to, adams, discovered, that, key, members, of, his, cabinet, namely, secretary, of, state, timothy, pickering, and, secretary, of, war, james, mchenry, were, more, loyal, to, hamilton, than, himself, adams, fired, them, in, may, 1800, in, november, 1799, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, had, left, one, democratic, republican, newspaper, functioning, in, new, york, city, when, the, last, newspaper, the, new, daily, advertiser, reprinted, an, article, saying, that, hamilton, had, attempted, to, purchase, the, philadelphia, aurora, to, close, it, down, and, said, the, purchase, could, have, been, funded, by, british, secret, service, money, hamilton, urged, the, new, york, attorney, general, to, prosecute, the, publisher, for, seditious, libel, and, the, prosecution, compelled, the, owner, to, close, the, paper, in, the, 1800, election, hamilton, worked, to, defeat, not, only, the, democratic, republicans, but, also, his, party, s, own, nominee, john, adams, 392, 99, aaron, burr, had, won, new, york, for, jefferson, in, may, via, the, new, york, city, legislative, elections, as, the, legislature, was, to, choose, new, york, s, electors, now, hamilton, proposed, a, direct, election, with, carefully, drawn, districts, where, each, district, s, voters, would, choose, an, elector, such, that, the, federalists, would, split, the, electoral, vote, of, new, york, jay, who, had, resigned, from, the, supreme, court, to, be, governor, of, new, york, wrote, on, the, back, of, a, letter, proposing, a, measure, for, party, purposes, which, it, would, not, become, me, to, adopt, and, declined, to, reply, adams, was, running, this, time, with, charles, cotesworth, pinckney, the, elder, brother, of, former, vice, presidential, candidate, thomas, hamilton, toured, new, england, again, urging, northern, electors, to, hold, firm, for, pinckney, in, the, renewed, hope, of, making, pinckney, president, and, he, again, intrigued, in, south, carolina, 350, 51, hamilton, s, ideas, involved, coaxing, middle, state, federalists, to, assert, their, non, support, for, adams, if, there, was, no, support, for, pinckney, and, writing, to, more, of, the, modest, supports, of, adams, concerning, his, supposed, misconduct, while, president, 350, 51, hamilton, expected, to, see, southern, states, such, as, the, carolinas, cast, their, votes, for, pinckney, and, jefferson, and, would, result, in, the, former, being, ahead, of, both, adams, and, jefferson, 394, 95, in, accordance, with, the, second, of, the, aforementioned, plans, and, a, recent, personal, rift, with, adams, 351, hamilton, wrote, a, pamphlet, called, letter, from, alexander, hamilton, concerning, the, public, conduct, and, character, of, john, adams, esq, president, of, the, united, states, that, was, highly, critical, of, him, though, it, closed, with, a, tepid, endorsement, 396, jefferson, had, beaten, adams, but, both, he, and, aaron, burr, had, received, 73, votes, in, the, electoral, college, with, jefferson, and, burr, tied, the, house, of, representatives, had, to, choose, between, the, two, men, 352, 399, several, federalists, who, opposed, jefferson, supported, burr, and, for, the, first, 35, ballots, jefferson, was, denied, a, majority, before, the, 36th, ballot, hamilton, threw, his, weight, behind, jefferson, supporting, the, arrangement, reached, by, james, a, bayard, of, delaware, in, which, five, federalist, representatives, from, maryland, and, vermont, abstained, from, voting, allowing, those, states, delegations, to, go, for, jefferson, ending, the, impasse, and, electing, jefferson, president, rather, than, burr, 350, 51, even, though, hamilton, did, not, like, jefferson, and, disagreed, with, him, on, many, issues, he, viewed, jefferson, as, the, lesser, of, two, evils, hamilton, spoke, of, jefferson, as, being, by, far, not, so, a, dangerous, man, and, of, burr, as, a, mischievous, enemy, to, the, principal, measure, of, the, past, administration, it, was, for, that, reason, along, with, the, fact, that, burr, was, a, northerner, and, not, a, virginian, that, many, federalist, representatives, voted, for, him, hamilton, wrote, many, letters, to, friends, in, congress, to, convince, the, members, to, see, otherwise, 352, 401, in, the, end, burr, would, become, vice, president, after, losing, to, jefferson, however, according, to, several, historians, the, federalists, had, rejected, hamilton, s, diatribe, as, reasons, to, not, vote, for, burr, 353, 401, in, his, book, american, machiavelli, alexander, hamilton, and, the, origins, of, us, foreign, policy, historian, john, lamberton, harper, stated, hamilton, could, have, perhaps, contributed, to, a, degree, in, burr, s, defeat, ron, chernow, alternatively, claimed, that, hamilton, squelched, burr, s, chance, at, becoming, president, when, it, became, clear, that, jefferson, had, developed, his, own, concerns, about, burr, and, would, not, support, his, return, to, the, vice, presidency, burr, sought, the, new, york, governorship, in, 1804, with, federalist, support, against, the, jeffersonian, morgan, lewis, but, was, defeated, by, forces, including, hamilton, soon, after, lewis, gubernatorial, victory, the, albany, register, published, charles, d, cooper, s, letters, citing, hamilton, s, opposition, to, burr, and, alleging, that, hamilton, had, expressed, a, still, more, despicable, opinion, of, the, vice, president, at, an, upstate, new, york, dinner, party, cooper, claimed, that, the, letter, was, intercepted, after, relaying, the, information, but, stated, he, was, unusually, cautious, in, recollecting, the, information, from, the, dinner, burr, sensing, an, attack, on, his, honor, and, recovering, from, his, defeat, demanded, an, apology, in, the, form, of, a, letter, hamilton, wrote, a, letter, in, response, and, ultimately, refused, because, he, could, not, recall, the, instance, of, insulting, burr, hamilton, would, also, have, been, accused, of, recanting, cooper, s, letter, out, of, cowardice, 423, 24, after, a, series, of, attempts, to, reconcile, were, to, no, avail, a, duel, was, arranged, through, liaisons, on, june, 27, 1804, 426, the, concept, of, honor, was, fundamental, to, hamilton, s, vision, of, himself, and, of, the, nation, historians, have, noted, as, evidence, of, the, importance, that, honor, held, in, hamilton, s, value, system, that, hamilton, had, previously, been, a, party, to, seven, affairs, of, honor, as, a, principal, and, to, three, as, an, advisor, or, second, such, affairs, of, honor, were, often, concluded, prior, to, reaching, the, final, stage, of, a, duel, before, the, duel, hamilton, wrote, an, explanation, of, his, decision, to, participate, while, at, the, same, time, intending, to, throw, away, his, shot, his, desire, to, be, available, for, future, political, matters, also, played, a, factor, a, week, before, the, duel, at, an, annual, independence, day, dinner, of, the, society, of, the, cincinnati, both, hamilton, and, burr, were, in, attendance, separate, accounts, confirm, that, hamilton, was, uncharacteristically, effusive, while, burr, was, by, contrast, uncharacteristically, withdrawn, accounts, also, agree, that, burr, became, roused, when, hamilton, again, uncharacteristically, sang, a, favorite, song, which, recent, scholarship, indicates, that, it, was, how, stands, the, glass, around, an, anthem, sung, by, military, troops, about, fighting, and, dying, in, war, the, duel, began, at, dawn, on, july, 11, 1804, along, the, west, bank, of, the, hudson, river, on, a, rocky, ledge, in, weehawken, new, jersey, both, opponents, were, rowed, over, from, manhattan, separately, from, different, locations, as, the, spot, was, not, accessible, from, the, west, due, to, the, steepness, of, the, adjoining, cliffs, coincidentally, the, duel, took, place, relatively, close, to, the, location, of, the, duel, that, had, ended, the, life, of, hamilton, s, eldest, son, philip, three, years, earlier, lots, were, cast, for, the, choice, of, position, and, which, second, should, start, the, duel, both, were, won, by, hamilton, s, second, who, chose, the, upper, edge, of, the, ledge, for, hamilton, facing, the, city, to, the, east, toward, the, rising, sun, after, the, seconds, had, measured, the, paces, hamilton, according, to, both, william, p, van, ness, and, burr, raised, his, pistol, as, if, to, try, the, light, and, had, to, wear, his, glasses, to, prevent, his, vision, from, being, obscured, hamilton, also, refused, the, more, sensitive, hairspring, setting, for, the, dueling, pistols, offered, by, nathaniel, pendleton, and, burr, was, unaware, of, the, option, vice, president, burr, shot, hamilton, delivering, what, proved, to, be, a, fatal, wound, hamilton, s, shot, was, said, to, have, broken, a, tree, branch, directly, above, burr, s, head, neither, of, the, seconds, pendleton, nor, van, ness, could, determine, who, fired, first, as, each, claimed, that, the, other, man, had, fired, first, soon, after, they, measured, and, triangulated, the, shooting, but, could, not, determine, from, which, angle, hamilton, had, fired, burr, s, shot, hit, hamilton, in, the, lower, abdomen, above, his, right, hip, the, bullet, ricocheted, off, hamilton, s, second, or, third, false, rib, fracturing, it, and, causing, considerable, damage, to, his, internal, organs, particularly, his, liver, and, diaphragm, before, becoming, lodged, in, his, first, or, second, lumbar, vertebra, 429, the, biographer, ron, chernow, considers, the, circumstances, to, indicate, that, after, taking, deliberate, aim, burr, fired, second, while, the, biographer, james, earnest, cooke, suggests, that, burr, took, careful, aim, and, shot, first, and, hamilton, fired, while, falling, after, being, struck, by, burr, s, bullet, the, paralyzed, hamilton, was, immediately, attended, by, the, same, surgeon, who, tended, philip, hamilton, and, ferried, to, the, greenwich, village, boarding, house, of, his, friend, william, bayard, jr, who, had, been, waiting, on, the, dock, on, his, deathbed, hamilton, asked, the, episcopal, bishop, of, new, york, benjamin, moore, to, give, him, holy, communion, moore, initially, declined, to, do, so, on, the, grounds, that, participating, in, a, duel, was, a, mortal, sin, and, that, hamilton, although, undoubtedly, sincere, in, his, faith, was, not, a, member, of, the, episcopalian, denomination, after, leaving, moore, was, persuaded, to, return, that, afternoon, by, the, urgent, pleas, of, hamilton, s, friends, upon, receiving, hamilton, s, solemn, assurance, that, he, repented, for, his, part, in, the, duel, moore, gave, him, communion, after, final, visits, from, his, family, friends, and, considerable, suffering, for, at, least, 31, hours, hamilton, died, at, two, o, clock, the, following, afternoon, july, 12, 1804, at, bayard, s, home, just, below, the, present, gansevoort, street, the, city, fathers, halted, all, business, at, noon, two, days, later, for, hamilton, s, funeral, the, procession, route, of, about, two, miles, organized, by, the, society, of, the, cincinnati, had, so, many, participants, of, every, class, of, citizen, that, it, took, hours, to, complete, and, was, widely, reported, nationwide, by, newspapers, moore, conducted, the, funeral, service, at, trinity, church, gouverneur, morris, gave, the, eulogy, and, secretly, established, a, fund, to, support, his, widow, and, children, hamilton, was, buried, in, the, church, s, cemetery, as, a, youth, in, the, west, indies, hamilton, was, an, orthodox, and, conventional, presbyterian, of, the, new, lights, he, was, mentored, there, by, a, former, student, of, john, witherspoon, a, moderate, of, the, new, school, he, wrote, two, or, three, hymns, which, were, published, in, the, local, newspaper, robert, troup, his, college, roommate, noted, that, hamilton, was, in, the, habit, of, praying, on, his, knees, night, and, morning, 10, according, to, gordon, wood, hamilton, dropped, his, youthful, religiosity, during, the, revolution, and, became, a, conventional, liberal, with, theistic, inclinations, who, was, an, irregular, churchgoer, at, best, however, he, returned, to, religion, in, his, last, years, chernow, wrote, that, hamilton, was, nominally, an, episcopalian, but, e, was, not, clearly, affiliated, with, the, denomination, and, did, not, seem, to, attend, church, regularly, or, take, communion, like, adams, franklin, and, jefferson, hamilton, had, probably, fallen, under, the, sway, of, deism, which, sought, to, substitute, reason, for, revelation, and, dropped, the, notion, of, an, active, god, who, intervened, in, human, affairs, at, the, same, time, he, never, doubted, god, s, existence, embracing, christianity, as, a, system, of, morality, and, cosmic, justice, stories, were, circulated, that, hamilton, had, made, two, quips, about, god, at, the, time, of, the, constitutional, convention, in, 1787, during, the, french, revolution, he, displayed, a, utilitarian, approach, to, using, religion, for, political, ends, such, as, by, maligning, jefferson, as, the, atheist, and, insisting, that, christianity, and, jeffersonian, democracy, were, incompatible, 316, after, 1801, hamilton, further, attested, his, belief, in, christianity, proposing, a, christian, constitutional, society, in, 1802, to, take, hold, of, some, strong, feeling, of, the, mind, to, elect, fit, men, to, office, and, advocating, christian, welfare, societies, for, the, poor, after, being, shot, hamilton, spoke, of, his, belief, in, god, s, mercy, on, his, deathbed, hamilton, asked, the, episcopal, bishop, of, new, york, benjamin, moore, to, give, him, holy, communion, moore, initially, declined, to, do, so, on, two, grounds, that, to, participate, in, a, duel, was, a, mortal, sin, and, that, hamilton, although, undoubtedly, sincere, in, his, faith, was, not, a, member, of, the, episcopalian, denomination, after, leaving, moore, was, persuaded, to, return, that, afternoon, by, the, urgent, pleas, of, hamilton, s, friends, and, upon, receiving, hamilton, s, solemn, assurance, that, he, never, intended, to, shoot, burr, and, repented, for, his, part, in, the, duel, moore, gave, him, communion, bishop, moore, returned, the, next, morning, stayed, with, hamilton, for, several, hours, until, his, death, and, conducted, the, funeral, service, at, trinity, church, hamilton, s, birthplace, had, a, large, jewish, community, constituting, one, quarter, of, charlestown, s, white, population, by, the, 1720s, he, came, into, contact, with, jews, on, a, regular, basis, as, a, small, boy, he, was, tutored, by, a, jewish, schoolmistress, and, had, learned, to, recite, the, ten, commandments, in, the, original, hebrew, hamilton, exhibited, a, degree, of, respect, for, jews, that, was, described, by, chernow, as, a, life, long, reverence, he, believed, that, jewish, achievement, was, a, result, of, divine, providence, the, state, and, progress, of, the, jews, from, their, earliest, history, to, the, present, time, has, been, so, entirely, out, of, the, ordinary, course, of, human, affairs, is, it, not, then, a, fair, conclusion, that, the, cause, also, is, an, extraordinary, one, in, other, words, that, it, is, the, effect, of, some, great, providential, plan, the, man, who, will, draw, this, conclusion, will, look, for, the, solution, in, the, bible, he, who, will, not, draw, it, ought, to, give, us, another, fair, solution, based, primarily, on, the, phonetic, similarity, of, lavien, to, a, common, jewish, surname, it, has, been, suggested, that, johann, lavien, the, first, husband, of, hamilton, s, mother, was, jewish, or, of, jewish, descent, on, this, contested, foundation, it, was, rumored, that, hamilton, himself, was, born, jewish, a, claim, that, gained, some, popularity, early, in, the, 20th, century, and, that, was, given, serious, consideration, by, one, present, day, historian, the, belief, that, lavien, was, jewish, was, popularized, by, gertrude, atherton, in, her, 1902, novel, the, conqueror, a, fictionalized, biography, of, hamilton, which, made, the, earliest, known, written, assertion, of, the, claim, the, consensus, of, mainstream, scholars, and, historians, who, have, addressed, the, underlying, question, of, whether, lavien, was, jewish, such, as, ron, chernow, is, that, the, assertion, is, not, credible, hamilton, s, interpretations, of, the, constitution, set, forth, in, the, federalist, papers, remain, highly, influential, as, seen, in, scholarly, studies, and, court, decisions, although, the, constitution, was, ambiguous, as, to, the, exact, balance, of, power, between, national, and, state, governments, hamilton, consistently, took, the, side, of, greater, federal, power, at, the, expense, of, the, states, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, hamilton, found, himself, in, opposition, to, then, secretary, of, state, thomas, jefferson, who, opposed, establishing, a, de, facto, central, bank, hamilton, justified, the, creation, of, this, bank, and, other, federal, powers, under, congress, s, constitutional, authority, to, issue, currency, regulate, interstate, commerce, and, do, anything, else, that, would, be, necessary, and, proper, to, enact, the, provisions, of, the, constitution, jefferson, however, took, a, stricter, view, of, the, constitution, parsing, the, text, carefully, he, found, no, specific, authorization, for, the, establishment, of, a, national, bank, this, controversy, was, eventually, settled, in, mcculloch, v, maryland, which, essentially, adopted, hamilton, s, view, granting, the, federal, government, broad, freedom, to, select, the, best, means, to, execute, its, constitutionally, enumerated, powers, essentially, confirming, the, doctrine, of, implied, powers, nevertheless, the, american, civil, war, and, the, progressive, era, demonstrated, the, sorts, of, crises, and, politics, hamilton, s, administrative, republic, sought, to, avoid, hamilton, s, policies, have, had, great, influence, on, the, development, of, the, u, s, government, his, constitutional, interpretation, particularly, of, the, necessary, and, proper, clause, set, precedents, for, federal, authority, that, are, still, used, by, the, courts, and, are, considered, an, authority, on, constitutional, interpretation, french, diplomat, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, p, rigord, who, spent, 1794, in, the, united, states, wrote, i, consider, napoleon, fox, and, hamilton, the, three, greatest, men, of, our, epoch, and, if, i, were, forced, to, decide, between, the, three, i, would, give, without, hesitation, the, first, place, to, hamilton, adding, that, hamilton, had, intuited, the, problems, of, european, conservatives, opinions, of, hamilton, run, the, gamut, both, adams, and, jefferson, viewed, him, as, unprincipled, and, dangerously, aristocratic, hamilton, s, reputation, was, mostly, negative, in, the, eras, of, jeffersonian, democracy, and, jacksonian, democracy, the, older, jeffersonian, view, attacked, hamilton, as, a, centralizer, sometimes, to, the, point, of, accusations, that, he, advocated, monarchy, by, the, progressive, era, herbert, croly, henry, cabot, lodge, and, theodore, roosevelt, praised, his, leadership, of, a, strong, government, several, republicans, in, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, entered, politics, by, writing, laudatory, biographies, of, hamilton, according, to, princeton, university, historian, sean, wilentz, more, recent, views, of, hamilton, and, his, reputation, have, been, favorable, among, scholars, who, portray, hamilton, as, the, visionary, architect, of, the, modern, liberal, capitalist, economy, and, of, a, dynamic, federal, government, headed, by, an, energetic, executive, conversely, modern, scholars, favoring, hamilton, have, portrayed, jefferson, and, his, allies, as, na, ve, dreamy, idealists, hamilton, is, not, known, to, have, ever, owned, slaves, although, members, of, his, family, did, at, the, time, of, her, death, hamilton, s, mother, owned, two, slaves, and, wrote, a, will, leaving, them, to, her, sons, however, due, to, their, illegitimacy, hamilton, and, his, brother, were, held, ineligible, to, inherit, her, property, and, never, took, ownership, of, the, slaves, 17, later, as, a, youth, in, saint, croix, hamilton, worked, for, a, company, trading, in, commodities, that, included, slaves, 17, historians, have, discussed, whether, hamilton, personally, owned, slaves, later, in, life, biographer, ron, chernow, argued, that, while, there, is, no, definite, proof, that, hamilton, personally, owned, slaves, oblique, hints, in, hamilton, s, papers, suggest, he, and, eliza, may, have, owned, one, or, two, household, slaves, hamilton, occasionally, handled, slave, transactions, as, the, legal, representative, of, his, own, family, members, and, his, grandson, allan, mclane, hamilton, interpreted, some, of, these, journal, entries, as, being, purchases, for, himself, in, 1840, however, his, son, john, maintained, that, his, father, never, owned, a, slave, but, on, the, contrary, having, learned, that, a, domestic, whom, he, had, hired, was, about, to, be, sold, by, her, master, he, immediately, purchased, her, freedom, by, the, time, of, hamilton, s, early, participation, in, the, american, revolution, his, abolitionist, sensibilities, had, become, evident, he, was, active, during, the, revolutionary, war, in, trying, to, raise, black, troops, for, the, army, with, the, promise, of, freedom, in, the, 1780s, and, 1790s, hamilton, generally, opposed, pro, slavery, southern, interests, which, he, saw, as, hypocritical, to, the, values, of, the, revolution, in, 1785, he, joined, his, close, associate, john, jay, in, founding, the, new, york, manumission, society, which, successfully, promoted, the, abolition, of, the, international, slave, trade, in, new, york, city, and, passed, a, state, law, to, end, slavery, in, new, york, through, a, decades, long, process, of, emancipation, with, a, final, end, to, slavery, in, the, state, on, july, 4, 1827, at, a, time, when, most, white, leaders, doubted, the, capacity, of, blacks, hamilton, believed, slavery, was, morally, wrong, and, wrote, that, their, natural, faculties, are, as, good, as, ours, unlike, contemporaries, such, as, jefferson, who, considered, the, removal, of, freed, slaves, to, a, western, territory, west, indies, or, africa, to, be, essential, to, any, plan, for, emancipation, hamilton, pressed, for, abolition, without, such, provisions, 22, hamilton, and, other, federalists, supported, the, haitian, revolution, which, had, originated, as, a, slave, revolt, 23, his, suggestions, helped, shape, the, haitian, constitution, in, 1804, when, haiti, became, an, independent, state, with, a, majority, black, population, hamilton, urged, closer, economic, and, diplomatic, ties, 23, hamilton, has, been, portrayed, as, the, patron, saint, of, the, american, school, economic, philosophy, that, according, to, one, historian, later, dominated, american, economic, policy, after, 1861, his, ideas, and, work, influenced, the, 19th, century, german, economist, friedrich, list, and, abraham, lincoln, s, chief, economic, advisor, henry, charles, carey, as, early, as, the, fall, of, 1781, hamilton, firmly, supported, government, intervention, in, favor, of, business, after, the, manner, of, jean, baptiste, colbert, in, contrast, to, the, british, policy, of, international, mercantilism, which, he, believed, skewed, benefits, to, colonial, and, imperial, powers, hamilton, was, a, pioneering, advocate, of, protectionism, he, is, credited, with, the, idea, that, industrialization, would, only, be, possible, with, tariffs, to, protect, the, infant, industries, of, an, emerging, nation, political, theorists, credit, hamilton, with, the, creation, of, the, modern, administrative, state, citing, his, arguments, in, favor, of, a, strong, executive, linked, to, the, support, of, the, people, as, the, linchpin, of, an, administrative, republic, the, dominance, of, executive, leadership, in, the, formulation, and, carrying, out, of, policy, was, in, his, view, essential, to, resist, the, deterioration, of, a, republican, government, some, scholars, have, raised, similarities, between, hamiltonian, recommendations, and, the, development, of, meiji, japan, as, evidence, of, the, global, influence, of, hamilton, s, theory, hamilton, has, appeared, as, a, significant, figure, in, popular, works, of, historical, fiction, including, many, that, focused, on, other, american, political, figures, of, his, time, in, comparison, to, other, founding, fathers, hamilton, attracted, relatively, little, attention, in, american, popular, culture, in, the, 20th, century, in, 2015, he, gained, significant, mainstream, attention, after, the, debut, of, the, broadway, show, hamilton, lin, manuel, miranda, played, the, title, role, and, wrote, the, musical, based, on, a, biography, by, ron, chernow, the, musical, was, described, by, the, new, yorker, as, an, achievement, of, historical, and, cultural, reimagining, in, miranda, s, telling, the, headlong, rise, of, one, self, made, immigrant, becomes, the, story, of, america, the, off, broadway, production, of, hamilton, won, the, 2015, drama, desk, award, for, outstanding, musical, as, well, as, seven, other, drama, desk, awards, in, 2016, hamilton, received, the, pulitzer, prize, for, drama, and, set, a, record, with, 16, tony, award, nominations, of, which, the, show, won, 11, including, best, musical, during, the, presidency, of, barack, obama, a, plan, to, replace, hamilton, on, the, ten, dollar, bill,
