skeptic, who, tried, to, uphold, optimate, principles, during, the, political, crises, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, roman, empire, his, extensive, writings, include, treatises, on, rhetoric, philosophy, and, politics, he, is, considered, one, of, rome, s, greatest, orators, and, prose, stylists, and, the, innovator, of, what, became, known, as, ciceronian, rhetoric, cicero, was, educated, in, rome, and, in, greece, he, came, from, a, wealthy, municipal, family, of, the, roman, equestrian, order, and, served, as, consul, in, 63, bc, he, greatly, influenced, both, ancient, and, modern, reception, of, the, latin, language, a, substantial, percentage, of, his, work, has, survived, and, he, was, admired, by, both, ancient, and, modern, authors, alike, cicero, adapted, the, arguments, of, the, chief, schools, of, hellenistic, philosophy, in, latin, and, created, a, large, amount, of, latin, philosophical, vocabulary, via, lexical, innovation, e, g, neologisms, such, as, evidentia, generator, humanitas, infinitio, qualitas, quantitas, almost, 150, of, which, were, the, result, of, translating, greek, philosophical, terms, though, he, was, an, accomplished, orator, and, successful, lawyer, cicero, believed, his, political, career, was, his, most, important, achievement, it, was, during, his, consulship, that, the, catiline, conspiracy, attempted, to, overthrow, the, government, through, an, attack, on, the, city, by, outside, forces, and, cicero, by, his, own, account, suppressed, the, revolt, by, summarily, and, controversially, executing, five, conspirators, without, trial, an, act, which, would, later, lead, to, his, exile, during, the, chaotic, middle, period, of, the, first, century, bc, marked, by, civil, wars, and, the, dictatorship, of, julius, caesar, cicero, was, a, supporter, of, the, optimates, faction, following, caesar, s, death, cicero, became, an, enemy, of, mark, antony, in, the, ensuing, power, struggle, attacking, him, in, a, series, of, speeches, he, was, proscribed, as, an, enemy, of, the, state, by, the, second, triumvirate, and, consequently, executed, by, soldiers, operating, on, their, behalf, in, 43, bc, having, been, intercepted, during, an, attempted, flight, from, the, italian, peninsula, his, severed, hands, and, head, taken, by, order, of, antony, and, displayed, representing, the, repercussions, of, his, anti, antonian, actions, as, a, writer, and, as, an, orator, respectively, were, then, displayed, on, the, rostra, petrarch, s, rediscovery, of, cicero, s, letters, is, often, credited, for, initiating, the, 14th, century, renaissance, in, public, affairs, humanism, and, classical, roman, culture, according, to, polish, historian, tadeusz, zieli, ski, the, renaissance, was, above, all, things, a, revival, of, cicero, and, only, after, him, and, through, him, of, the, rest, of, classical, antiquity, the, peak, of, cicero, s, authority, and, prestige, came, during, the, 18th, century, enlightenment, and, his, impact, on, leading, enlightenment, thinkers, and, political, theorists, such, as, john, locke, david, hume, montesquieu, and, edmund, burke, was, substantial, his, works, rank, among, the, most, influential, in, global, culture, and, today, still, constitute, one, of, the, most, important, bodies, of, primary, material, for, the, writing, and, revision, of, roman, history, especially, the, last, days, of, the, roman, republic, marcus, tullius, cicero, was, born, on, 3, january, 106, bc, in, arpinum, a, hill, town, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, southeast, of, rome, he, belonged, to, the, tribus, cornelia, his, father, was, a, wealthy, member, of, the, equestrian, order, and, possessed, good, connections, in, rome, however, being, a, semi, invalid, he, could, not, enter, public, life, and, studied, extensively, to, compensate, little, is, known, about, cicero, s, mother, helvia, but, cicero, s, brother, quintus, wrote, in, a, letter, that, she, was, a, thrifty, housewife, cicero, s, cognomen, a, hereditary, nickname, comes, from, the, latin, for, chickpea, cicer, plutarch, explains, that, the, name, was, originally, given, to, one, of, cicero, s, ancestors, who, had, a, cleft, in, the, tip, of, his, nose, resembling, a, chickpea, the, famous, family, names, of, fabius, lentulus, and, piso, come, from, the, latin, names, of, beans, lentils, and, peas, respectively, plutarch, writes, that, cicero, was, urged, to, change, this, deprecatory, name, when, he, entered, politics, but, refused, saying, that, he, would, make, cicero, more, glorious, than, scaurus, swollen, ankled, and, catulus, puppy, at, the, age, of, 15, in, 90, bc, cicero, started, serving, under, pompey, strabo, and, later, sulla, in, the, social, war, between, rome, and, its, italian, allies, when, in, rome, during, the, turbulent, plebeian, tribunate, of, publius, sulpicius, rufus, in, 88, bc, which, saw, a, short, bout, of, fighting, between, the, sulpicius, and, sulla, who, had, been, elected, consul, for, that, year, cicero, found, himself, greatly, impressed, by, sulpicius, oratory, even, if, he, disagreed, with, his, politics, he, continued, his, studies, at, rome, writing, a, pamphlet, titled, on, invention, relating, to, rhetorical, argumentation, and, studying, philosophy, with, greek, academics, who, had, fled, the, ongoing, first, mithridatic, war, during, this, period, in, roman, history, greek, language, and, cultural, studies, were, highly, valued, by, the, elite, classes, cicero, was, therefore, educated, in, the, teachings, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, poets, and, historians, as, he, obtained, much, of, his, understanding, of, the, theory, and, practice, of, rhetoric, from, the, greek, poet, archias, cicero, used, his, knowledge, of, greek, to, translate, many, of, the, theoretical, concepts, of, greek, philosophy, into, latin, thus, translating, greek, philosophical, works, for, a, larger, audience, it, was, precisely, his, broad, education, that, tied, him, to, the, traditional, roman, elite, cicero, s, interest, in, philosophy, figured, heavily, in, his, later, career, and, led, to, him, providing, a, comprehensive, account, of, greek, philosophy, for, a, roman, audience, including, creating, a, philosophical, vocabulary, in, latin, in, 87, bc, philo, of, larissa, the, head, of, the, platonic, academy, that, had, been, founded, by, plato, in, athens, about, 300, years, earlier, arrived, in, rome, cicero, inspired, by, an, extraordinary, zeal, for, philosophy, sat, enthusiastically, at, his, feet, and, absorbed, carneades, academic, skeptic, philosophy, according, to, plutarch, cicero, was, an, extremely, talented, student, whose, learning, attracted, attention, from, all, over, rome, affording, him, the, opportunity, to, study, roman, law, under, quintus, mucius, scaevola, cicero, s, fellow, students, were, gaius, marius, minor, servius, sulpicius, rufus, who, became, a, famous, lawyer, one, of, the, few, whom, cicero, considered, superior, to, himself, in, legal, matters, and, titus, pomponius, the, latter, two, became, cicero, s, friends, for, life, and, pomponius, who, later, received, the, nickname, atticus, and, whose, sister, married, cicero, s, brother, would, become, in, cicero, s, own, words, as, a, second, brother, with, both, maintaining, a, lifelong, correspondence, in, 79, bc, cicero, left, for, greece, asia, minor, and, rhodes, this, was, perhaps, to, avoid, the, potential, wrath, of, sulla, as, plutarch, claims, though, cicero, himself, says, it, was, to, hone, his, skills, and, improve, his, physical, fitness, in, athens, he, studied, philosophy, with, antiochus, of, ascalon, the, old, academic, and, initiator, of, middle, platonism, in, asia, minor, he, met, the, leading, orators, of, the, region, and, continued, to, study, with, them, cicero, then, journeyed, to, rhodes, to, meet, his, former, teacher, apollonius, molon, who, had, taught, him, in, rome, molon, helped, cicero, hone, the, excesses, in, his, style, as, well, as, train, his, body, and, lungs, for, the, demands, of, public, speaking, charting, a, middle, path, between, the, competing, attic, and, asiatic, styles, cicero, would, ultimately, become, considered, second, only, to, demosthenes, among, history, s, orators, while, cicero, had, feared, that, the, law, courts, would, be, closed, forever, they, were, reopened, in, the, aftermath, of, sulla, s, civil, war, and, the, purging, of, sulla, s, political, opponents, in, the, proscriptions, many, of, the, orators, whom, cicero, had, admired, in, his, youth, were, now, dead, from, age, or, political, violence, his, first, major, appearance, in, the, courts, was, in, 81, bc, at, the, age, of, 26, when, he, delivered, pro, quinctio, a, speech, defending, certain, commercial, transactions, which, cicero, had, recorded, and, disseminated, his, more, famous, speech, defending, sextus, roscius, of, ameria, pro, roscio, amerino, on, charges, of, parricide, in, 80, bc, was, his, first, appearance, in, criminal, court, in, this, high, profile, case, cicero, accused, a, freedman, of, the, dictator, sulla, chrysogonus, of, fabricating, roscius, father, s, proscription, to, obtain, roscius, family, s, property, successful, in, his, defence, cicero, tactfully, avoided, incriminating, sulla, of, any, wrongdoing, and, developed, a, positive, oratorical, reputation, for, himself, while, plutarch, claims, that, cicero, left, rome, shortly, thereafter, out, of, fear, of, sulla, s, response, according, to, kathryn, tempest, most, scholars, now, dismiss, this, suggestion, because, cicero, left, rome, after, sulla, resigned, his, dictatorship, cicero, for, his, part, later, claimed, that, he, left, rome, headed, for, asia, to, develop, his, physique, and, develop, his, oratory, after, marrying, his, wife, terentia, in, 80, bc, he, eventually, left, for, asia, minor, with, his, brother, quintus, his, friend, titus, atticus, and, others, on, a, long, trip, spanning, most, of, 79, through, 77, bc, returning, to, rome, in, 77, bc, cicero, again, busied, himself, with, legal, defence, in, 76, bc, at, the, quaestorian, elections, cicero, was, elected, at, the, minimum, age, required, 30, years, in, the, first, returns, from, the, comitia, tributa, to, the, post, of, quaestor, ex, officio, he, also, became, a, member, of, the, senate, in, the, quaestorian, lot, he, was, assigned, to, sicily, for, 75, bc, the, post, which, was, largely, one, related, to, financial, administration, in, support, of, the, state, or, provincial, governors, proved, for, cicero, an, important, place, where, he, could, gain, clients, in, the, provinces, his, time, in, sicily, saw, him, balance, his, duties, largely, in, terms, of, sending, more, grain, back, to, rome, with, his, support, for, the, provincials, roman, businessmen, in, the, area, and, local, potentates, adeptly, balancing, those, responsibilities, he, won, their, gratitude, he, was, also, appreciated, by, local, syracusans, for, the, rediscovery, of, the, lost, tomb, of, archimedes, which, he, personally, financed, promising, to, lend, the, sicilians, his, oratorical, voice, he, was, called, on, a, few, years, after, his, quaestorship, to, prosecute, the, roman, province, s, governor, gaius, verres, for, abuse, of, power, and, corruption, in, 70, bc, at, the, age, of, 36, cicero, launched, his, first, high, profile, prosecution, against, verres, an, emblem, of, the, corrupt, sullan, supporters, who, had, risen, in, the, chaos, of, the, civil, war, the, prosecution, of, gaius, verres, was, a, great, forensic, success, for, cicero, while, verres, hired, the, prominent, lawyer, quintus, hortensius, after, a, lengthy, period, in, sicily, collecting, testimonials, and, evidence, and, persuading, witnesses, to, come, forward, cicero, returned, to, rome, and, won, the, case, in, a, series, of, dramatic, court, battles, his, unique, style, of, oratory, set, him, apart, from, the, flamboyant, hortensius, on, the, conclusion, of, this, case, cicero, came, to, be, considered, the, greatest, orator, in, rome, the, view, that, cicero, may, have, taken, the, case, for, reasons, of, his, own, is, viable, hortensius, was, at, this, point, known, as, the, best, lawyer, in, rome, to, beat, him, would, guarantee, much, success, and, the, prestige, that, cicero, needed, to, start, his, career, cicero, s, oratorical, ability, is, shown, in, his, character, assassination, of, verres, and, various, other, techniques, of, persuasion, used, on, the, jury, one, such, example, is, found, in, the, speech, in, verrem, where, he, states, with, you, on, this, bench, gentlemen, with, marcus, acilius, glabrio, as, your, president, i, do, not, understand, what, verres, can, hope, to, achieve, oratory, was, considered, a, great, art, in, ancient, rome, and, an, important, tool, for, disseminating, knowledge, and, promoting, oneself, in, elections, in, part, because, there, were, no, regular, newspapers, or, mass, media, cicero, was, neither, a, patrician, nor, a, plebeian, noble, his, rise, to, political, office, despite, his, relatively, humble, origins, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, his, brilliance, as, an, orator, cicero, grew, up, in, a, time, of, civil, unrest, and, war, sulla, s, victory, in, the, first, of, a, series, of, civil, wars, led, to, a, new, constitutional, framework, that, undermined, libertas, liberty, the, fundamental, value, of, the, roman, republic, nonetheless, sulla, s, reforms, strengthened, the, position, of, the, equestrian, class, contributing, to, that, class, s, growing, political, power, cicero, was, both, an, italian, eques, and, a, novus, homo, but, more, importantly, he, was, a, roman, constitutionalist, his, social, class, and, loyalty, to, the, republic, ensured, that, he, would, command, the, support, and, confidence, of, the, people, as, well, as, the, italian, middle, classes, the, optimates, faction, never, truly, accepted, cicero, and, this, undermined, his, efforts, to, reform, the, republic, while, preserving, the, constitution, nevertheless, he, successfully, ascended, the, cursus, honorum, holding, each, magistracy, at, or, near, the, youngest, possible, age, quaestor, in, 75, bc, age, 30, aedile, in, 69, bc, age, 36, and, praetor, in, 66, bc, age, 39, when, he, served, as, president, of, the, reclamation, or, extortion, court, he, was, then, elected, consul, at, age, 42, cicero, seizing, the, opportunity, offered, by, optimate, fear, of, reform, was, elected, consul, for, the, year, 63, bc, he, was, elected, with, the, support, of, every, unit, of, the, centuriate, assembly, rival, members, of, the, post, sullan, establishment, and, the, leaders, of, municipalities, throughout, post, social, war, italy, his, co, consul, for, the, year, gaius, antonius, hybrida, played, a, minor, role, he, began, his, consular, year, by, opposing, a, land, bill, proposed, by, a, plebeian, tribune, which, would, have, appointed, commissioners, with, semi, permanent, authority, over, land, reform, cicero, was, also, active, in, the, courts, defending, gaius, rabirius, from, accusations, of, participating, in, the, unlawful, killing, of, plebeian, tribune, lucius, appuleius, saturninus, in, 100, bc, the, prosecution, occurred, before, the, comita, centuriata, and, threatened, to, reopen, conflict, between, the, marian, and, sullan, factions, at, rome, cicero, defended, the, use, of, force, as, being, authorised, by, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, which, would, prove, similar, to, his, own, use, of, force, under, such, conditions, most, famously, in, part, because, of, his, own, publicity, he, thwarted, a, conspiracy, led, by, lucius, sergius, catilina, to, overthrow, the, roman, republic, with, the, help, of, foreign, armed, forces, cicero, procured, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, a, recommendation, from, the, senate, attempting, to, legitimise, the, use, of, force, and, drove, catiline, from, the, city, with, four, vehement, speeches, the, catilinarian, orations, which, remain, outstanding, examples, of, his, rhetorical, style, the, orations, listed, catiline, and, his, followers, debaucheries, and, denounced, catiline, s, senatorial, sympathizers, as, roguish, and, dissolute, debtors, clinging, to, catiline, as, a, final, and, desperate, hope, cicero, demanded, that, catiline, and, his, followers, leave, the, city, at, the, conclusion, of, cicero, s, first, speech, which, was, made, in, the, temple, of, jupiter, stator, catiline, hurriedly, left, the, senate, in, his, following, speeches, cicero, did, not, directly, address, catiline, he, delivered, the, second, and, third, orations, before, the, people, and, the, last, one, again, before, the, senate, by, these, speeches, cicero, wanted, to, prepare, the, senate, for, the, worst, possible, case, he, also, delivered, more, evidence, against, catiline, catiline, fled, and, left, behind, his, followers, to, start, the, revolution, from, within, while, he, himself, assaulted, the, city, with, an, army, of, moral, and, financial, bankrupts, or, of, honest, fanatics, and, adventurers, it, is, alleged, that, catiline, had, attempted, to, involve, the, allobroges, a, tribe, of, transalpine, gaul, in, their, plot, but, cicero, working, with, the, gauls, was, able, to, seize, letters, that, incriminated, the, five, conspirators, and, forced, them, to, confess, in, front, of, the, senate, the, senate, then, deliberated, upon, the, conspirators, punishment, as, it, was, the, dominant, advisory, body, to, the, various, legislative, assemblies, rather, than, a, judicial, body, there, were, limits, to, its, power, however, martial, law, was, in, effect, and, it, was, feared, that, simple, house, arrest, or, exile, the, standard, options, would, not, remove, the, threat, to, the, state, at, first, decimus, junius, silanus, spoke, for, the, extreme, penalty, but, during, the, debate, many, were, swayed, by, julius, caesar, who, decried, the, precedent, it, would, set, and, argued, in, favor, of, life, imprisonment, in, various, italian, towns, cato, the, younger, then, rose, in, defense, of, the, death, penalty, and, the, senate, finally, agreed, on, the, matter, and, came, down, in, support, of, the, death, penalty, cicero, had, the, conspirators, taken, to, the, tullianum, the, notorious, roman, prison, where, they, were, strangled, cicero, himself, accompanied, the, former, consul, publius, cornelius, lentulus, sura, one, of, the, conspirators, to, the, tullianum, cicero, received, the, honorific, pater, patriae, for, his, efforts, to, suppress, the, conspiracy, but, lived, thereafter, in, fear, of, trial, or, exile, for, having, put, roman, citizens, to, death, without, trial, while, the, senatus, consultum, ultimum, gave, some, legitimacy, to, the, use, of, force, against, the, conspirators, cicero, also, argued, that, catiline, s, conspiracy, by, virtue, of, its, treason, made, the, conspirators, enemies, of, the, state, and, forfeited, the, protections, intrinsically, possessed, by, roman, citizens, the, consuls, moved, decisively, antonius, hybrida, was, dispatched, to, defeat, catiline, in, battle, that, year, preventing, crassus, or, pompey, from, exploiting, the, situation, for, their, own, political, aims, after, the, suppression, of, the, conspiracy, cicero, was, proud, of, his, accomplishment, some, of, his, political, enemies, argued, that, though, the, act, gained, cicero, popularity, he, exaggerated, the, extent, of, his, success, he, overestimated, his, popularity, again, several, years, later, after, being, exiled, from, italy, and, then, allowed, back, from, exile, at, this, time, he, claimed, that, the, republic, would, be, restored, along, with, him, shortly, after, completing, his, consulship, in, late, 62, bc, cicero, arranged, the, purchase, of, a, large, townhouse, on, the, palatine, hill, previously, owned, by, rome, s, richest, citizen, marcus, licinius, crassus, to, finance, the, purchase, cicero, borrowed, some, two, million, sesterces, from, publius, cornelius, sulla, whom, he, had, previously, defended, from, court, cicero, boasted, his, house, was, in, conspectu, prope, totius, urbis, in, sight, of, nearly, the, whole, city, only, a, short, walk, from, the, roman, forum, in, 60, bc, julius, caesar, invited, cicero, to, be, the, fourth, member, of, his, existing, partnership, with, pompey, and, marcus, licinius, crassus, an, assembly, that, would, eventually, be, called, the, first, triumvirate, cicero, refused, the, invitation, because, he, suspected, it, would, undermine, the, republic, and, because, he, was, strongly, opposed, to, anything, unconstitutional, that, limited, the, powers, of, the, consuls, and, replaced, them, with, non, elected, officials, during, caesar, s, consulship, of, 59, bc, the, triumvirate, had, achieved, many, of, their, goals, of, land, reform, publicani, debt, forgiveness, ratification, of, pompeian, conquests, etc, with, caesar, leaving, for, his, provinces, they, wished, to, maintain, their, hold, on, politics, they, engineered, the, adoption, of, patrician, publius, clodius, pulcher, into, a, plebeian, family, and, had, him, elected, as, one, of, the, ten, tribunes, of, the, plebs, for, 58, bc, clodius, used, the, triumvirate, s, backing, to, push, through, legislation, that, benefited, them, he, introduced, several, laws, the, leges, clodiae, that, made, him, popular, with, the, people, strengthening, his, power, base, then, he, turned, on, cicero, clodius, passed, a, law, which, made, it, illegal, to, offer, fire, and, water, i, e, shelter, or, food, to, anyone, who, executed, a, roman, citizen, without, a, trial, cicero, having, executed, members, of, the, catiline, conspiracy, four, years, previously, without, formal, trial, was, clearly, the, intended, target, furthermore, many, believed, that, clodius, acted, in, concert, with, the, triumvirate, who, feared, that, cicero, would, seek, to, abolish, many, of, caesar, s, accomplishments, while, consul, the, year, before, cicero, argued, that, the, senatus, consultum, ultimum, indemnified, him, from, punishment, and, he, attempted, to, gain, the, support, of, the, senators, and, consuls, especially, of, pompey, cicero, grew, out, his, hair, dressed, in, mourning, and, toured, the, streets, clodius, gangs, dogged, him, hurling, abuse, stones, and, even, excrement, hortensius, trying, to, rally, to, his, old, rival, s, support, was, almost, lynched, the, senate, and, the, consuls, were, cowed, caesar, who, was, still, encamped, near, rome, was, apologetic, but, said, he, could, do, nothing, when, cicero, brought, himself, to, grovel, in, the, proconsul, s, tent, everyone, seemed, to, have, abandoned, cicero, after, clodius, passed, a, law, to, deny, to, cicero, fire, and, water, i, e, shelter, within, four, hundred, miles, of, rome, cicero, went, into, exile, he, arrived, at, thessalonica, on, 23, may, 58, bc, in, his, absence, clodius, who, lived, next, door, to, cicero, on, the, palatine, arranged, for, cicero, s, house, to, be, confiscated, by, the, state, and, was, even, able, to, purchase, a, part, of, the, property, in, order, to, extend, his, own, house, after, demolishing, cicero, s, house, clodius, had, the, land, consecrated, and, symbolically, erected, a, temple, of, liberty, aedes, libertatis, on, the, vacant, land, cicero, s, exile, caused, him, to, fall, into, depression, he, wrote, to, atticus, your, pleas, have, prevented, me, from, committing, suicide, but, what, is, there, to, live, for, don, t, blame, me, for, complaining, my, afflictions, surpass, any, you, ever, heard, of, earlier, after, the, intervention, of, recently, elected, tribune, titus, annius, milo, acting, on, the, behalf, of, pompey, who, wanted, cicero, as, a, client, the, senate, voted, in, favor, of, recalling, cicero, from, exile, clodius, cast, the, single, vote, against, the, decree, cicero, returned, to, italy, on, 5, august, 57, bc, landing, at, brundisium, he, was, greeted, by, a, cheering, crowd, and, to, his, delight, his, beloved, daughter, tullia, in, his, oratio, de, domo, sua, ad, pontifices, cicero, convinced, the, college, of, pontiffs, to, rule, that, the, consecration, of, his, land, was, invalid, thereby, allowing, him, to, regain, his, property, and, rebuild, his, house, on, the, palatine, cicero, tried, to, re, enter, politics, as, an, independent, operator, but, his, attempts, to, attack, portions, of, caesar, s, legislation, were, unsuccessful, and, encouraged, caesar, to, re, solidify, his, political, alliance, with, pompey, and, crassus, the, conference, at, luca, in, 56, bc, left, the, three, man, alliance, in, domination, of, the, republic, s, politics, this, forced, cicero, to, recant, and, support, the, triumvirate, out, of, fear, from, being, entirely, excluded, from, public, life, after, the, conference, cicero, lavishly, praised, caesar, s, achievements, got, the, senate, to, vote, a, thanksgiving, for, caesar, s, victories, and, grant, money, to, pay, his, troops, he, also, delivered, a, speech, on, the, consular, provinces, latin, de, provinciis, consularibus, which, checked, an, attempt, by, caesar, s, enemies, to, strip, him, of, his, provinces, in, gaul, after, this, a, cowed, cicero, concentrated, on, his, literary, works, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, was, directly, involved, in, politics, for, the, following, few, years, his, legal, work, largely, consisted, of, defending, allies, of, the, ruling, triumvirs, and, his, own, personal, friends, and, allies, he, defended, his, former, pupil, marcus, caelius, rufus, against, a, charge, of, murder, in, 56, under, the, influence, of, the, triumvirs, he, had, also, defended, his, former, enemies, publius, vatinius, in, august, 54, bce, marcus, aemilius, scaurus, between, july, and, september, and, gnaeus, plancius, with, the, pro, plancio, in, september, which, weakened, his, prestige, and, sparked, attacks, on, his, integrity, luca, grillo, has, suggested, these, cases, as, the, source, of, the, poet, catullus, s, double, edged, comment, that, cicero, was, the, best, defender, of, anybody, in, 51, bc, he, reluctantly, accepted, a, promagistracy, as, proconsul, in, cilicia, for, the, year, there, were, few, other, former, consuls, eligible, as, a, result, of, a, legislative, requirement, enacted, by, pompey, in, 52, bc, specifying, an, interval, of, five, years, between, a, consulship, or, praetorship, and, a, provincial, command, he, served, as, proconsul, of, cilicia, from, may, 51, bc, arriving, in, the, provinces, three, months, later, around, august, in, 53, bc, marcus, licinius, crassus, had, been, defeated, by, the, parthians, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, this, opened, the, roman, east, for, a, parthian, invasion, causing, unrest, in, syria, and, cilicia, cicero, restored, calm, by, his, mild, system, of, government, he, discovered, that, a, great, amount, of, public, property, had, been, embezzled, by, corrupt, previous, governors, and, members, of, their, staff, and, did, his, utmost, to, restore, it, thus, he, greatly, improved, the, condition, of, the, cities, he, retained, the, civil, rights, of, and, exempted, from, penalties, the, men, who, gave, the, property, back, besides, this, he, was, extremely, frugal, in, his, outlays, for, staff, and, private, expenses, during, his, governorship, and, this, made, him, highly, popular, among, the, natives, besides, his, activity, in, ameliorating, the, hard, pecuniary, situation, of, the, province, cicero, was, also, creditably, active, in, the, military, sphere, early, in, his, governorship, he, received, information, that, prince, pacorus, son, of, orodes, ii, the, king, of, the, parthians, had, crossed, the, euphrates, and, was, ravaging, the, syrian, countryside, and, had, even, besieged, cassius, the, interim, roman, commander, in, syria, in, antioch, cicero, eventually, marched, with, two, understrength, legions, and, a, large, contingent, of, auxiliary, cavalry, to, cassius, s, relief, pacorus, and, his, army, had, already, given, up, on, besieging, antioch, and, were, heading, south, through, syria, ravaging, the, countryside, again, cassius, and, his, legions, followed, them, harrying, them, wherever, they, went, eventually, ambushing, and, defeating, them, near, antigonea, another, large, troop, of, parthian, horsemen, was, defeated, by, cicero, s, cavalry, who, happened, to, run, into, them, while, scouting, ahead, of, the, main, army, cicero, next, defeated, some, robbers, who, were, based, on, mount, amanus, and, was, hailed, as, imperator, by, his, troops, afterwards, he, led, his, army, against, the, independent, cilician, mountain, tribes, besieging, their, fortress, of, pindenissum, it, took, him, 47, days, to, reduce, the, place, which, fell, in, december, on, 30, july, 50, bc, cicero, left, the, province, to, his, brother, quintus, who, had, accompanied, him, on, his, governorship, as, his, legate, on, his, way, back, to, rome, he, stopped, in, rhodes, and, then, went, to, athens, where, he, caught, up, with, his, old, friend, titus, pomponius, atticus, and, met, men, of, great, learning, cicero, arrived, in, rome, on, 4, january, 49, bc, he, stayed, outside, the, pomerium, to, retain, his, promagisterial, powers, either, in, expectation, of, a, triumph, or, to, retain, his, independent, command, authority, in, the, coming, civil, war, the, struggle, between, pompey, and, julius, caesar, grew, more, intense, in, 50, bc, cicero, favored, pompey, seeing, him, as, a, defender, of, the, senate, and, republican, tradition, but, at, that, time, avoided, openly, alienating, caesar, when, caesar, invaded, italy, in, 49, bc, cicero, fled, rome, caesar, seeking, an, endorsement, by, a, senior, senator, courted, cicero, s, favor, but, even, so, cicero, slipped, out, of, italy, and, traveled, to, dyrrhachium, where, pompey, s, staff, was, situated, cicero, traveled, with, the, pompeian, forces, to, pharsalus, in, macedonia, in, 48, bc, though, he, was, quickly, losing, faith, in, the, competence, and, righteousness, of, the, pompeian, side, eventually, he, provoked, the, hostility, of, his, fellow, senator, cato, who, told, him, that, he, would, have, been, of, more, use, to, the, cause, of, the, optimates, if, he, had, stayed, in, rome, after, caesar, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, pharsalus, on, 9, august, cicero, refused, to, take, command, of, the, pompeian, forces, and, continue, the, war, he, returned, to, rome, still, as, a, promagistrate, with, his, lictors, in, 47, bc, and, dismissed, them, upon, his, crossing, the, pomerium, and, renouncing, his, command, in, a, letter, to, varro, on, c, 20, april, 46, bc, cicero, outlined, his, strategy, under, caesar, s, dictatorship, cicero, however, was, taken, by, surprise, when, the, liberatores, assassinated, caesar, on, the, ides, of, march, 44, bc, cicero, was, not, included, in, the, conspiracy, even, though, the, conspirators, were, sure, of, his, sympathy, marcus, junius, brutus, called, out, cicero, s, name, asking, him, to, restore, the, republic, when, he, lifted, his, bloodstained, dagger, after, the, assassination, a, letter, cicero, wrote, in, february, 43, bc, to, trebonius, one, of, the, conspirators, began, how, i, could, wish, that, you, had, invited, me, to, that, most, glorious, banquet, on, the, ides, of, march, cicero, became, a, popular, leader, during, the, period, of, instability, following, the, assassination, he, had, no, respect, for, mark, antony, who, was, scheming, to, take, revenge, upon, caesar, s, murderers, in, exchange, for, amnesty, for, the, assassins, he, arranged, for, the, senate, to, agree, not, to, declare, caesar, to, have, been, a, tyrant, which, allowed, the, caesarians, to, have, lawful, support, and, kept, caesar, s, reforms, and, policies, intact, in, april, 43, bc, diehard, republicans, may, have, revived, the, ancient, position, of, princeps, senatus, leader, of, the, senate, for, cicero, this, position, had, been, very, prestigious, until, the, constitutional, reforms, of, sulla, in, 82, 80, bc, which, removed, most, of, its, importance, on, the, other, side, antony, was, consul, and, leader, of, the, caesarian, faction, and, unofficial, executor, of, caesar, s, public, will, relations, between, the, two, were, never, friendly, and, worsened, after, cicero, claimed, that, antony, was, taking, liberties, in, interpreting, caesar, s, wishes, and, intentions, octavian, was, caesar, s, adopted, son, and, heir, after, he, returned, to, italy, cicero, began, to, play, him, against, antony, he, praised, octavian, declaring, he, would, not, make, the, same, mistakes, as, his, father, he, attacked, antony, in, a, series, of, speeches, he, called, the, philippics, named, after, demosthenes, s, denunciations, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, at, the, time, cicero, s, popularity, as, a, public, figure, was, unrivalled, cicero, supported, decimus, junius, brutus, albinus, as, governor, of, cisalpine, gaul, gallia, cisalpina, and, urged, the, senate, to, name, antony, an, enemy, of, the, state, the, speech, of, lucius, piso, caesar, s, father, in, law, delayed, proceedings, against, antony, antony, was, later, declared, an, enemy, of, the, state, when, he, refused, to, lift, the, siege, of, mutina, which, was, in, the, hands, of, decimus, brutus, cicero, s, plan, to, drive, out, antony, failed, antony, and, octavian, reconciled, and, allied, with, lepidus, to, form, the, second, triumvirate, after, the, successive, battles, of, forum, gallorum, and, mutina, the, alliance, came, into, official, existence, with, the, lex, titia, passed, on, 27, november, 43, bc, which, gave, each, triumvir, a, consular, imperium, for, five, years, the, triumvirate, immediately, began, a, proscription, of, their, enemies, modeled, after, that, of, sulla, in, 82, bc, cicero, and, all, of, his, contacts, and, supporters, were, numbered, among, the, enemies, of, the, state, even, though, octavian, argued, for, two, days, against, cicero, being, added, to, the, list, cicero, was, one, of, the, most, viciously, and, doggedly, hunted, among, the, proscribed, he, was, viewed, with, sympathy, by, a, large, segment, of, the, public, and, many, people, refused, to, report, that, they, had, seen, him, he, was, caught, on, 7, december, 43, bc, leaving, his, villa, in, formiae, in, a, litter, heading, to, the, seaside, where, he, hoped, to, embark, on, a, ship, destined, for, macedonia, when, his, killers, herennius, a, centurion, and, popilius, a, tribune, arrived, cicero, s, own, slaves, said, they, had, not, seen, him, but, he, was, given, away, by, philologus, a, freedman, of, his, brother, quintus, cicero, as, reported, by, seneca, the, elder, according, to, the, historian, aufidius, bassus, cicero, s, last, words, are, said, to, have, been, ego, vero, consisto, accede, veterane, et, si, hoc, saltim, potes, recte, facere, incide, cervicem, i, go, no, further, approach, veteran, soldier, and, if, you, can, at, least, do, so, much, properly, sever, this, neck, he, bowed, to, his, captors, leaning, his, head, out, of, the, litter, in, a, gladiatorial, gesture, to, ease, the, task, by, baring, his, neck, and, throat, to, the, soldiers, he, was, indicating, that, he, would, not, resist, according, to, plutarch, herennius, first, slew, him, then, cut, off, his, head, on, antony, s, instructions, his, hands, which, had, penned, the, philippics, against, antony, were, cut, off, as, well, these, were, nailed, along, with, his, head, on, the, rostra, in, the, forum, romanum, according, to, the, tradition, of, marius, and, sulla, both, of, whom, had, displayed, the, heads, of, their, enemies, in, the, forum, cicero, was, the, only, victim, of, the, proscriptions, who, was, displayed, in, that, manner, according, to, cassius, dio, in, a, story, often, mistakenly, attributed, to, plutarch, antony, s, wife, fulvia, took, cicero, s, head, pulled, out, his, tongue, and, jabbed, it, repeatedly, with, her, hairpin, in, final, revenge, against, cicero, s, power, of, speech, cicero, s, son, marcus, tullius, cicero, minor, during, his, year, as, a, consul, in, 30, bc, avenged, his, father, s, death, to, a, certain, extent, when, he, announced, to, the, senate, mark, antony, s, naval, defeat, at, actium, in, 31, bc, by, octavian, octavian, is, reported, to, have, praised, cicero, as, a, patriot, and, a, scholar, of, meaning, in, later, times, within, the, circle, of, his, family, however, it, was, octavian, s, acquiescence, that, had, allowed, cicero, to, be, killed, as, cicero, was, condemned, by, the, new, triumvirate, cicero, s, career, as, a, statesman, was, marked, by, inconsistencies, and, a, tendency, to, shift, his, position, in, response, to, changes, in, the, political, climate, his, indecision, may, be, attributed, to, his, sensitive, and, impressionable, personality, he, was, prone, to, overreaction, in, the, face, of, political, and, private, change, would, that, he, had, been, able, to, endure, prosperity, with, greater, self, control, and, adversity, with, more, fortitude, wrote, c, asinius, pollio, a, contemporary, roman, statesman, and, historian, cicero, married, terentia, probably, at, the, age, of, 27, in, 79, bc, according, to, the, upper, class, mores, of, the, day, it, was, a, marriage, of, convenience, but, lasted, harmoniously, for, nearly, 30, years, terentia, s, family, was, wealthy, probably, the, plebeian, noble, house, of, terenti, varrones, thus, meeting, the, needs, of, cicero, s, political, ambitions, in, both, economic, and, social, terms, she, had, a, half, sister, named, fabia, who, as, a, child, had, become, a, vestal, virgin, a, great, honour, terentia, was, a, strong, willed, woman, and, citing, plutarch, took, more, interest, in, her, husband, s, political, career, than, she, allowed, him, to, take, in, household, affairs, in, the, 50s, bc, cicero, s, letters, to, terentia, became, shorter, and, colder, he, complained, to, his, friends, that, terentia, had, betrayed, him, but, did, not, specify, in, which, sense, perhaps, the, marriage, could, not, outlast, the, strain, of, the, political, upheaval, in, rome, cicero, s, involvement, in, it, and, various, other, disputes, between, the, two, the, divorce, appears, to, have, taken, place, in, 51, bc, or, shortly, before, in, 46, or, 45, bc, cicero, married, a, young, girl, publilia, who, had, been, his, ward, it, is, thought, that, cicero, needed, her, money, particularly, after, having, to, repay, the, dowry, of, terentia, who, came, from, a, wealthy, family, although, his, marriage, to, terentia, was, one, of, convenience, it, is, commonly, known, that, cicero, held, great, love, for, his, daughter, tullia, when, she, suddenly, became, ill, in, february, 45, bc, and, died, after, having, seemingly, recovered, from, giving, birth, to, a, son, in, january, cicero, was, stunned, i, have, lost, the, one, thing, that, bound, me, to, life, he, wrote, to, atticus, atticus, told, him, to, come, for, a, visit, during, the, first, weeks, of, his, bereavement, so, that, he, could, comfort, him, when, his, pain, was, at, its, greatest, in, atticus, s, large, library, cicero, read, everything, that, the, greek, philosophers, had, written, about, overcoming, grief, but, my, sorrow, defeats, all, consolation, caesar, and, brutus, as, well, as, servius, sulpicius, rufus, sent, him, letters, of, condolence, cicero, hoped, that, his, son, marcus, would, become, a, philosopher, like, him, but, marcus, himself, wished, for, a, military, career, he, joined, the, army, of, pompey, in, 49, bc, and, after, pompey, s, defeat, at, pharsalus, 48, bc, he, was, pardoned, by, caesar, cicero, sent, him, to, athens, to, study, as, a, disciple, of, the, peripatetic, philosopher, kratippos, in, 48, bc, but, he, used, this, absence, from, his, father, s, vigilant, eye, to, eat, drink, and, be, merry, after, cicero, s, death, he, joined, the, army, of, the, liberatores, but, was, later, pardoned, by, augustus, augustus, s, bad, conscience, for, having, given, in, to, cicero, s, being, put, on, the, proscription, list, during, the, second, triumvirate, led, him, to, aid, considerably, marcus, minor, s, career, he, became, an, augur, and, was, nominated, consul, in, 30, bc, together, with, augustus, as, such, he, was, responsible, for, revoking, the, honors, of, mark, antony, who, was, responsible, for, the, proscription, and, could, in, this, way, take, revenge, later, he, was, appointed, proconsul, of, syria, and, the, province, of, asia, cicero, has, been, traditionally, considered, the, master, of, latin, prose, with, quintilian, declaring, that, cicero, was, not, the, name, of, a, man, but, of, eloquence, itself, the, english, words, ciceronian, meaning, eloquent, and, cicerone, meaning, local, guide, derive, from, his, name, he, is, credited, with, transforming, latin, from, a, modest, utilitarian, language, into, a, versatile, literary, medium, capable, of, expressing, abstract, and, complicated, thoughts, with, clarity, julius, caesar, praised, cicero, s, achievement, by, saying, it, is, more, important, to, have, greatly, extended, the, frontiers, of, the, roman, spirit, than, the, frontiers, of, the, roman, empire, according, to, john, william, mackail, cicero, s, unique, and, imperishable, glory, is, that, he, created, the, language, of, the, civilized, world, and, used, that, language, to, create, a, style, which, nineteen, centuries, have, not, replaced, and, in, some, respects, have, hardly, altered, cicero, was, also, an, energetic, writer, with, an, interest, in, a, wide, variety, of, subjects, in, keeping, with, the, hellenistic, philosophical, and, rhetorical, traditions, in, which, he, was, trained, the, quality, and, ready, accessibility, of, ciceronian, texts, favored, very, wide, distribution, and, inclusion, in, teaching, curricula, as, suggested, by, a, graffito, at, pompeii, admonishing, you, will, like, cicero, or, you, will, be, whipped, cicero, was, greatly, admired, by, influential, church, fathers, such, as, augustine, of, hippo, who, credited, cicero, s, lost, hortensius, for, his, eventual, conversion, to, christianity, and, st, jerome, who, had, a, feverish, vision, in, which, he, was, accused, of, being, follower, of, cicero, and, not, of, christ, before, the, judgment, seat, this, influence, further, increased, after, the, early, middle, ages, in, europe, where, more, of, his, writings, survived, than, any, other, latin, author, medieval, philosophers, were, influenced, by, cicero, s, writings, on, natural, law, and, innate, rights, petrarch, s, rediscovery, of, cicero, s, letters, provided, the, impetus, for, searches, for, ancient, greek, and, latin, writings, scattered, throughout, european, monasteries, and, the, subsequent, rediscovery, of, classical, antiquity, led, to, the, renaissance, subsequently, cicero, became, synonymous, with, classical, latin, to, such, an, extent, that, a, number, of, humanist, scholars, began, to, assert, that, no, latin, word, or, phrase, should, be, used, unless, it, appeared, in, cicero, s, works, a, stance, criticised, by, erasmus, his, voluminous, correspondence, much, of, it, addressed, to, his, friend, atticus, has, been, especially, influential, introducing, the, art, of, refined, letter, writing, to, european, culture, cornelius, nepos, the, first, century, bc, biographer, of, atticus, remarked, that, cicero, s, letters, contained, such, a, wealth, of, detail, concerning, the, inclinations, of, leading, men, the, faults, of, the, generals, and, the, revolutions, in, the, government, that, their, reader, had, little, need, for, a, history, of, the, period, among, cicero, s, admirers, were, desiderius, erasmus, martin, luther, and, john, locke, following, the, invention, of, johannes, gutenberg, s, printing, press, de, officiis, was, the, second, book, printed, in, europe, after, the, gutenberg, bible, scholars, note, cicero, s, influence, on, the, rebirth, of, religious, toleration, in, the, 17th, century, cicero, was, especially, popular, with, the, philosophes, of, the, 18th, century, including, edward, gibbon, diderot, david, hume, montesquieu, and, voltaire, gibbon, wrote, of, his, first, experience, reading, the, author, s, collective, works, thus, i, tasted, the, beauty, of, the, language, i, breathed, the, spirit, of, freedom, and, i, imbibed, from, his, precepts, and, examples, the, public, and, private, sense, of, a, man, after, finishing, the, great, author, a, library, of, eloquence, and, reason, i, formed, a, more, extensive, plan, of, reviewing, the, latin, classics, voltaire, called, cicero, the, greatest, as, well, as, the, most, elegant, of, roman, philosophers, and, even, staged, a, play, based, on, cicero, s, role, in, the, catilinarian, conspiracy, called, rome, sauv, e, ou, catilina, to, make, young, people, who, go, to, the, theatre, acquainted, with, cicero, voltaire, was, spurred, to, pen, the, drama, as, a, rebuff, to, his, rival, claude, prosper, jolyot, de, cr, billon, s, own, play, catilina, which, had, portrayed, cicero, as, a, coward, and, villain, who, hypocritically, married, his, own, daughter, to, catiline, montesquieu, produced, his, discourse, on, cicero, in, 1717, in, which, he, heaped, praise, on, the, author, because, he, rescued, philosophy, from, the, hands, of, scholars, and, freed, it, from, the, confusion, of, a, foreign, language, montesquieu, went, on, to, declare, that, cicero, was, of, all, the, ancients, the, one, who, had, the, most, personal, merit, and, whom, i, would, prefer, to, resemble, internationally, cicero, the, republican, inspired, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, and, the, revolutionaries, of, the, french, revolution, john, adams, said, as, all, the, ages, of, the, world, have, not, produced, a, greater, statesman, and, philosopher, united, than, cicero, his, authority, should, have, great, weight, thomas, jefferson, names, cicero, as, one, of, a, handful, of, major, figures, who, contributed, to, a, tradition, of, public, right, that, informed, his, draft, of, the, declaration, of, independence, and, shaped, american, understandings, of, the, common, sense, basis, for, the, right, of, revolution, camille, desmoulins, said, of, the, french, republicans, in, 1789, that, they, were, mostly, young, people, who, nourished, by, the, reading, of, cicero, at, school, had, become, passionate, enthusiasts, for, liberty, jim, powell, starts, his, book, on, the, history, of, liberty, with, the, sentence, marcus, tullius, cicero, expressed, principles, that, became, the, bedrock, of, liberty, in, the, modern, world, likewise, no, other, ancient, personality, has, inspired, as, much, venomous, dislike, as, cicero, especially, in, more, modern, times, his, commitment, to, the, values, of, the, republic, accommodated, a, hatred, of, the, poor, and, persistent, opposition, to, the, advocates, and, mechanisms, of, popular, representation, friedrich, engels, referred, to, him, as, the, most, contemptible, scoundrel, in, history, for, upholding, republican, democracy, while, at, the, same, time, denouncing, land, and, class, reforms, cicero, has, faced, criticism, for, exaggerating, the, democratic, qualities, of, republican, rome, and, for, defending, the, roman, oligarchy, against, the, popular, reforms, of, caesar, michael, parenti, admits, cicero, s, abilities, as, an, orator, but, finds, him, a, vain, pompous, and, hypocritical, personality, who, when, it, suited, him, could, show, public, support, for, popular, causes, that, he, privately, despised, parenti, presents, cicero, s, prosecution, of, the, catiline, conspiracy, as, legally, flawed, at, least, and, possibly, unlawful, cicero, also, had, an, influence, on, modern, astronomy, nicolaus, copernicus, searching, for, ancient, views, on, earth, motion, said, that, he, first, found, in, cicero, that, hicetas, supposed, the, earth, to, move, notably, cicero, was, the, name, attributed, to, size, 12, font, in, typesetting, table, drawers, for, ease, of, reference, type, sizes, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and, 20, were, all, given, different, names, cicero, was, declared, a, righteous, pagan, by, the, early, church, and, therefore, many, of, his, works, were, deemed, worthy, of, preservation, subsequent, roman, and, medieval, christian, writers, quoted, liberally, from, his, works, de, re, publica, on, the, commonwealth, and, de, legibus, on, the, laws, and, much, of, his, work, has, been, recreated, from, these, surviving, fragments, cicero, also, articulated, an, early, abstract, conceptualization, of, rights, based, on, ancient, law, and, custom, of, cicero, s, books, six, on, rhetoric, have, survived, as, well, as, parts, of, seven, on, philosophy, of, his, speeches, 88, were, recorded, but, only, 52, survive, cicero, s, great, repute, in, italy, has, led, to, numerous, ruins, being, identified, as, having, belonged, to, him, though, none, have, been, substantiated, with, absolute, certainty, in, formia, two, roman, era, ruins, are, popularly, believed, to, be, cicero, s, mausoleum, the, tomba, di, cicerone, and, the, villa, where, he, was, assassinated, in, 43, bc, the, latter, building, is,
