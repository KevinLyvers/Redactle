the, police, kasparov, wrote, in, february, 2013, that, fascism, has, come, to, russia, project, putin, just, like, the, old, project, hitler, is, but, the, fruit, of, a, conspiracy, by, the, ruling, elite, fascist, rule, was, never, the, result, of, the, free, will, of, the, people, it, was, always, the, fruit, of, a, conspiracy, by, the, ruling, elites, kasparov, denied, rumours, in, april, 2013, that, he, was, planning, to, leave, russia, for, good, i, found, these, rumors, to, be, deeply, saddening, and, moreover, surprising, he, wrote, i, was, unable, to, respond, immediately, because, i, was, in, such, a, state, of, shock, that, such, an, incredibly, inaccurate, statement, the, likes, of, which, is, constantly, distributed, by, the, kremlin, s, propagandists, came, this, time, from, ilya, yashin, a, fellow, member, of, the, opposition, coordination, council, kso, and, my, former, colleague, from, the, solidarity, movement, he, also, accused, prominent, russian, journalist, vladimir, posner, of, failing, to, stand, up, to, putin, and, to, earlier, russian, and, soviet, leaders, however, kasparov, subsequently, fled, russia, less, than, three, months, later, on, 6, june, 2013, he, announced, that, he, had, left, his, homeland, on, account, of, fear, of, persecution, for, his, political, views, further, at, the, 2013, women, in, the, world, conference,

that, if, he, returned, to, russia, he, doubted, he, would, be, allowed, to, leave, again, given, putin, s, ongoing, crackdown, on, dissenters, so, for, the, time, being, he, said, i, refrain, from, returning, to, russia, he, explained, shortly, thereafter, in, an, article, for, the, daily, beast, that, this, had, not, been, intended, as, a, declaration, of, leaving, my, home, country, permanently, or, otherwise, but, merely, an, expression, of, the, dark, reality, of, the, situation, in, russia, today, where, nearly, half, the, members, of, the, opposition, s, coordinating, council, are, under, criminal, investigation, on, concocted, charges, he, noted, that, the, moscow, prosecutor, s, office, was, opening, an, investigation, that, would, limit, my, ability, to, travel, making, it, impossible, for, him, to, fulfil, professional, speaking, engagements, and, hindering, his, work, for, the, non, profit, kasparov, chess, foundation, which, has, centres, in, new, york, city, brussels, and, johannesburg, to, promote, chess, in, education, kasparov, further, wrote, in, his, june, 2013, daily, beast, article, that, the, mass, protests, in, moscow, 18, months, earlier, against, fraudulent, russian, elections, had, been, a, proud, moment, for, me, he, recalled, that, after, joining, the, opposition, movement, in, march, 2005, he, had, been, criticised, for, seeking, to, unite, every, anti, putin, element, in, the, country, to, march, together, regardless, of, ideology, therefore, the, sight, of, hundreds, of, flags, representing, every, group, from, liberals, to, nationalists, all, marching, together, for, russia, without, putin, was, the, fulfillment, of, a, dream, yet, most, russians, he, lamented, had, continued, to, slumber, even, as, putin, had, taken, off, the, flimsy, mask, of, democracy, to, reveal, himself, in, full, as, the, would, be, kgb, dictator, he, has, always, been, kasparov, responded, with, several, twitter, postings, to, a, september, 2013, the, new, york, times, op, ed, by, putin, i, hope, putin, has, taken, adequate, protections, he, tweeted, now, that, he, is, a, russian, journalist, his, life, may, be, in, grave, danger, also,

about, the, trial, in, kirov, of, fellow, opposition, leader, navalny, who, had, been, convicted, on, concocted, embezzlement, charges, only, to, see, the, prosecutor, surprisingly, ask, for, his, release, the, next, day, pending, appeal, the, judicial, process, and, the, democratic, process, in, russia, wrote, kasparov, are, both, elaborate, mockeries, created, to, distract, the, citizenry, at, home, and, to, help, western, leaders, avoid, confronting, the, awkward, fact, that, russia, has, returned, to, a, police, state, still, kasparov, felt, that, whatever, had, caused, the, kirov, prosecutor, s, about, face, my, optimism, tells, me, it, was, a, positive, sign, after, more, than, 13, years, of, predictable, repression, under, putin, anything, different, is, good, kasparov, has, been, outspoken, regarding, putin, s, antigay, laws, describing, them, as, only, the, most, recent, encroachment, on, the, freedom, of, speech, and, association, of, russia, s, citizens, which, the, international, community, had, largely, ignored, regarding, russia, s, hosting, of, the, 2014, winter, olympics, kasparov, explained, in, august, 2013, that, he, had, opposed, russia, s, bid, from, the, outset, since, it, would, allow, vladimir, putin, s, cronies, to, embezzle, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, and, lend, prestige, to, putin, s, authoritarian, regime, kasparov, did, not, support, the, proposed, sochi, olympics, boycott, writing, that, it, would, unfairly, punish, athletes, but, called, for, athletes, and, others, to, transform, putin, s, self, congratulatory, pet, project, into, a, spotlight, that, exposes, his, authoritarian, rule, to, the, world, in, september, kasparov, called, upon, politicians, to, refuse, to, attend, the, games, and, the, public, to, pressure, sponsors, and, the, media, such, that, coca, cola, for, example, could, put, a, rainbow, flag, on, each, coca, cola, can, and, nbc, could, do, interviews, with, russian, gay, activists, or, with, russian, political, activists, kasparov, also, emphasised, that, although, he, was, still, a, russian, citizen, he, had, good, reason, to, be, concerned, about, my, ability, to, leave, russia,

public, outrage, reportedly, several, of, the, blocked, sites, received, an, affidavit, noting, their, violations, however, kasparov, stated, that, his, site, had, received, no, such, notice, of,

kasparov, stated, that, the, only, language, that, putin, understands, is, power, and, his, power, is, his, money, arguing, that, the, united, states, should, target, the, bank, accounts, of, russian, oligarchs, to, force, russia, to, rein, in, its, criminals, cyberattacks, kasparov, spoke, out, against, the, invasion, of, ukraine, by, russia, on, twitter, the, only, way, this, really, ends, is, the, fall, of, putin, s, regime, by, collapse, of, russian, economy, and, defeat, in, ukraine, he, also, believed, that, pressure, must, be, kept, up, in, terms, of, sanctions, and, condemnations,

first, time, russian, security, forces, seemed, strangely, impotent, in, the, face, of, an, impending, terror, attack, pointing, out, that, in, both, the, 2002, moscow, theater, siege, and, the, 2004, beslan, school, attack, there, were, fsb, informants, in, both, terror, groups, yet, the, attacks, went, ahead, unimpeded, given, this, history, he, wrote, it, is, impossible, to, overlook, that, the,
