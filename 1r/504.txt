later, remembered, the, self, discipline, with, which, the, young, shostakovich, prepared, for, the, 1927, competition, was, astonishing, for, three, weeks, he, locked, himself, away, at, home, practicing, for, hours, at, a, time, having, postponed, his, composing, and, given, up, trips, to, the, theatre, and, visits, with, friends, even, more, startling, was, the, result, of, this, seclusion, of, course, prior, to, this, time, he, had, played, superbly, and, occasioned, glazunov, s, now, famous, glowing, reports, but, during, those, days, his, pianism, sharply, idiosyncratic, and, rhythmically, impulsive, multi, timbered, yet, graphically, defined, emerged, in, its, concentrated, form, natan, perelman, who, heard, shostakovich, play, his, chopin, programs, before, he, went, to, warsaw, said, that, his, anti, sentimental, playing, which, eschewed, rubato, and, extreme, dynamic, contrasts, was, unlike, anything, he, had, ever, heard, arnold, alschwang, called, shostakovich, s, playing, profound, and, lacking, any, salon, like, mannerisms, shostakovich, was, stricken, with, appendicitis, on, the, opening, day, of, the, competition, but, his, condition, improved, by, the, time, of, his, first, performance, on, 27, january, 1927, he, had, his, appendix, removed, on, 25, april, according, to, shostakovich, his, playing, found, favor, with, the, audience, he, persisted, into, the, final, round, of, the, competition, but, ultimately, earned, only, a, diploma, no, prize, oborin, was, declared, the, winner, shostakovich, was, upset, about, the, result, but, for, a, time, resolved, to, continue, a, career, as, performer, while, recovering, from, his, appendectomy, in, april, 1927, shostakovich, said, he, was, beginning, to, reassess, those, plans, when, i, was, well, i, practiced, the, piano, every, day, i, wanted, to, carry, on, like, that, until, autumn, and, then, decide, if, i, saw, that, i, had, not, improved, i, would, quit, the, whole, business, to, be, a, pianist, who, is, worse, than, szpinalski, etkin, ginzburg, and, bryushkov, it, is, commonly, thought, that, i, am, worse, than, them, is, not, worth, it, after, the, competition, shostakovich, and, oborin, spent, a, week, in, berlin, there, he, met, the, conductor, bruno, walter, who, was, so, impressed, by, shostakovich, s, first, symphony, that, he, conducted, its, first, performance, outside, russia, later, that, year, leopold, stokowski, led, the, american, premiere, the, next, year, in, philadelphia, and, also, made, the, work, s, first, recording, in, 1927, shostakovich, wrote, his, second, symphony, subtitled, to, october, a, patriotic, piece, with, a, pro, soviet, choral, finale, owing, to, its, modernism, it, did, not, meet, with, the, same, enthusiasm, as, his, first, this, year, also, marked, the, beginning, of, shostakovich, s, close, friendship, with, musicologist, and, theatre, critic, ivan, sollertinsky, whom, he, had, first, met, in, 1921, through, their, mutual, friends, lev, arnshtam, and, lydia, zhukova, shostakovich, later, said, that, sollertinsky, taught, to, understand, and, love, such, great, masters, as, brahms, mahler, and, bruckner, and, that, he, instilled, in, him, an, interest, in, music, from, bach, to, offenbach, while, writing, the, second, symphony, shostakovich, also, began, work, on, his, satirical, opera, the, nose, based, on, the, story, by, nikolai, gogol, in, june, 1929, against, the, composer, s, wishes, the, opera, was, given, a, concert, performance, it, was, ferociously, attacked, by, the, russian, association, of, proletarian, musicians, rapm, its, stage, premiere, on, 18, january, 1930, opened, to, generally, poor, reviews, and, widespread, incomprehension, among, musicians, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, shostakovich, worked, at, tram, a, proletarian, youth, theatre, although, he, did, little, work, in, this, post, it, shielded, him, from, ideological, attack, much, of, this, period, was, spent, writing, his, opera, lady, macbeth, of, mtsensk, which, was, first, performed, in, 1934, it, was, initially, immediately, successful, on, both, popular, and, official, levels, it, was, described, as, the, result, of, the, general, success, of, socialist, construction, of, the, correct, policy, of, the, party, and, as, an, opera, that, could, have, been, written, only, by, a, soviet, composer, brought, up, in, the, best, tradition, of, soviet, culture, shostakovich, married, his, first, wife, nina, varzar, in, 1932, difficulties, led, to,

for, a, performance, of, a, new, work, quiet, flows, the, don, based, on, the, novel, by, mikhail, sholokhov, by, the, little, known, composer, ivan, dzerzhinsky, who, was, called, to, stalin, s, box, at, the, end, of, the, performance, and, told, that, his, work, had, considerable, ideological, political, value, on, 26, january, stalin, revisited, the, opera, accompanied, by, vyacheslav, molotov, andrei, zhdanov, and, anastas, mikoyan, to, hear, lady, macbeth, of, the, mtsensk, district, he, and, his, entourage, left, without, speaking, to, anyone, shostakovich, had, been, forewarned, by, a, friend, that, he, should, postpone, a, planned, concert, tour, in, arkhangelsk, in, order, to, be, present, at, that, particular, performance, eyewitness, accounts, testify, that, shostakovich, was, white, as, a, sheet, when, he, went, to, take, his, bow, after, the, third, act, the, next, day, shostakovich, left, for, arkhangelsk, where, he, heard, on, 28, january, that, pravda, had, published, an, editorial, titled, muddle, instead, of, music, complaining, that, the, opera, was, a, deliberately, dissonant, muddled, stream, of, sounds, quacks, hoots, pants, and, gasps, shostakovich, continued, his, performance, tour, as, scheduled, with, no, disruptions, from, arkhangelsk, he, instructed, isaac, glikman, to, subscribe, to, a, clipping, service, the, editorial, was, the, signal, for, a, nationwide, campaign, during, which, even, soviet, music, critics, who, had, praised, the, opera, were, forced, to, recant, in, print, saying, they, failed, to, detect, the, shortcomings, of, lady, macbeth, as, pointed, out, by, pravda, there, was, resistance, from, those, who, admired, shostakovich, including, sollertinsky, who, turned, up, at, a, composers, meeting, in, leningrad,

the, leningrad, military, district, who, had, been, asked, by, marshal, mikhail, tukhachevsky, to, make, sure, that, he, was, all, right, when, the, writer, isaac, babel, was, under, arrest, four, years, later, he, told, his, interrogators, that, it, was, common, ground, for, us, to, proclaim, the, genius, of, the, slighted, shostakovich, on, 6, february, shostakovich, was, again, attacked, in, pravda, this, time, for, his, light, comic, ballet, the, limpid, stream, which, was, denounced, because, it, jangles, and, expresses, nothing, and, did, not, give, an, accurate, picture, of, peasant, life, on, a, collective, farm, fearful, that, he, was, about, to, be, arrested, shostakovich, secured, an, appointment, with, the, chairman, of, the, ussr, state, committee, on, culture, platon, kerzhentsev, who, reported, to, stalin, and, molotov, that, he, had, instructed, the, composer, to, reject, formalist, errors, and, in, his, art, attain, something, that, could, be, understood, by, the, broad, masses, and, that, shostakovich, had, admitted, being, in, the, wrong, and, had, asked, for, a, meeting, with, stalin, which, was, not, granted, the, pravda, campaign, against,

rsfsr, accused, the, composers, including, sergei, prokofiev, and, aram, khachaturian, of, writing, inappropriate, and, formalist, music, this, was, part, of, an, ongoing, anti, formalism, campaign, intended, to, root, out, all, western, compositional, influence, as, well, as, any, perceived, non, russian, output, the, conference, resulted, in, the, publication, of, the, central, committee, s, decree, on, v, muradeli, s, opera, the, great, friendship, which, targeted, all, soviet, composers, and, demanded, that, they, write, only, proletarian, music, or, music, for, the, masses, the, accused, composers, including, shostakovich, were, summoned, to, make, public, apologies, in, front, of, the, committee, most, of, shostakovich, s, works, were, banned, and, his, family, had, privileges, withdrawn, yuri, lyubimov, says, that, at, this, time, he, waited, for, his, arrest, at, night, out, on, the, landing, by, the, lift, so, that, at, least, his, family, wouldn, t, be, disturbed, the, decree, s, consequences, for, composers, were, harsh, shostakovich, was, among, those, dismissed, from, the, conservatory, altogether, for, him, the, loss, of, money, was, perhaps, the, heaviest, blow, others, still, in, the, conservatory, experienced, an, atmosphere, thick, with, suspicion, no, one, wanted, his, work, to, be, understood, as, formalist, so, many, resorted, to, accusing, their, colleagues, of, writing, or, performing, anti, proletarian, music, during, the, next, few, years, shostakovich, composed, three, categories, of, work, film, music, to, pay, the, rent, official, works, aimed, at, securing, official, rehabilitation, and, serious, works, for, the, desk, drawer, the, last, included, the, violin, concerto, no, 1, and, the, song, cycle, from, jewish, folk, poetry, the, cycle, was, written, at, a, time, when, the, postwar, anti, semitic, campaign, was, already, under, way, with, widespread, arrests, including, that, of, dobrushin, and, yiditsky, the, compilers, of, the, book, from, which, shostakovich, took, his, texts, the, restrictions, on, shostakovich, s, music, and, living, arrangements, were, eased, in, 1949, when, stalin, decided, that, the, soviets, needed, to, send, artistic, representatives, to, the, cultural, and, scientific, congress, for, world, peace, in, new, york, city, and, that, shostakovich, should, be, among, them, for, shostakovich, it, was, a, humiliating, experience, culminating, in, a, new, york, press, conference, where, he, was, expected, to, read, a, prepared, speech, nicolas, nabokov, who, was, present, in, the, audience, witnessed, shostakovich, starting, to, read, in, a, nervous, and, shaky, voice, before, he, had, to, break, off, and, the, speech, was, continued, in, english, by, a, suave, radio, baritone, fully, aware, that, shostakovich, was, not, free, to, speak, his, mind, nabokov, publicly, asked, him, whether, he, supported, the, then, recent, denunciation, of, stravinsky, s, music, in, the, soviet, union, a, great, admirer, of, stravinsky, who, had, been, influenced, by, his, music, shostakovich, had, no, alternative, but, to, answer, in, the, affirmative, nabokov, did, not, hesitate, to, write, that, this, demonstrated, that, shostakovich, was, not, a, free, man, but, an, obedient, tool, of, his, government, shostakovich, never, forgave, nabokov, for, this, public, humiliation, that, same, year, he, composed, the, cantata, song, of, the, forests, which, praised, stalin, as, the, great, gardener, stalin, s, death, in, 1953, was, the, biggest, step, toward, shostakovich, s, rehabilitation, as, a, creative, artist, which, was, marked, by, his, tenth, symphony, it, features, a, number, of, musical, quotations, and, codes, notably, the, dsch, and, elmira, motifs, elmira, nazirova, being, a, pianist, and, composer, who, had, studied, under, shostakovich, in, the, year, before, his, dismissal, from, the, moscow, conservatory, the, meaning, of, which, is, still, debated, while, the, savage, second, movement, according, to, testimony, is, intended, as, a, musical, portrait, of, stalin, the, tenth, ranks, alongside, the, fifth, and, seventh, as, one, of, shostakovich, s, most, popular, works, 1953, also, saw, a, stream, of, premieres, of, the, desk, drawer, works, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, shostakovich, had, close, relationships, with, two, of, his, pupils, galina, ustvolskaya, and, elmira, nazirova, in, the, background, to, all, this, remained, shostakovich, s, first, open, marriage, to, nina, varzar, until, her, death, in, 1954, he, taught, ustvolskaya, from, 1939, to, 1941, and, then, from, 1947, to, 1948, the, nature, of, their, relationship, is, far, from, clear, mstislav, rostropovich, described, it, as, tender, ustvolskaya, rejected, a, proposal, of, marriage, from, him, after, nina, s, death, shostakovich, s, daughter, galina, recalled, her, father, consulting, her, and, maxim, about, the, possibility, of, ustvolskaya, becoming, their, stepmother, ustvolskaya, s, friend, viktor, suslin, said, that, she, had, been, deeply, disappointed, by, conspicuous, silence, when, her, music, faced, criticism, after, her, graduation, from, the, leningrad, conservatory, the, relationship, with, nazirova, seems, to, have, been, one, sided, expressed, largely, in, his, letters, to, her, and, can, be, dated, to, around, 1953, to, 1956, he, married, his, second, wife, komsomol, activist, margarita, kainova, in, 1956, the, couple, proved, ill, matched, and, divorced, five, years, later, in, 1954, shostakovich, wrote, the, festive, overture, opus, 96, it, was, used, as, the, theme, music, for, the, 1980, summer, olympics, his, theme, from, the, film, pirogov, opus, 76a, finale, was, played, as, the, cauldron, was, lit, at, the, 2004, summer, olympics, in, athens, greece, in, 1959, shostakovich, appeared, on, stage, in, moscow, at, the, end, of, a, concert, performance, of, his, fifth, symphony, congratulating, leonard, bernstein, and, the, new, york, philharmonic, orchestra, for, their, performance, part, of, a, concert, tour, of, the, soviet, union, later, that, year, bernstein, and, the, philharmonic, recorded, the, symphony, in, boston, for, columbia, records, the, year, 1960, marked, another, turning, point, in, shostakovich, s, life, he, joined, the, communist, party, the, government, wanted, to, appoint, him, chairman, of, the, rsfsr, union, of, composers, but, to, hold, that, position, he, was, required, to, obtain, party, membership, it, was, understood, that, nikita, khrushchev, the, first, secretary, of, the, communist, party, from, 1953, to, 1964, was, looking, for, support, from, the, intelligentsia, s, leading, ranks, in, an, effort, to, create, a, better, relationship, with, the, soviet, union, s, artists, this, event, has, variously, been, interpreted, as, a, show, of, commitment, a, mark, of, cowardice, the, result, of, political, pressure, and, his, free, decision, on, the, one, hand, the, apparat, was, less, repressive, than, it, had, been, before, stalin, s, death, on, the, other, his, son, recalled, that, the, event, reduced, shostakovich, to, tears, and, that, he, later, told, his, wife, irina, that, he, had, been, blackmailed, lev, lebedinsky, has, said, that, the, composer, was, suicidal, in, 1960, he, was, appointed, chairman, of, the, rsfsr, union, of, composers, from, 1962, until, his, death, he, also, served, as, a, delegate, in, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, ussr, by, joining, the, party, shostakovich, also, committed, himself, to, finally, writing, the, homage, to, lenin, that, he, had, promised, before, his, twelfth, symphony, which, portrays, the, bolshevik, revolution, and, was, completed, in, 1961, was, dedicated, to, lenin, and, called, the, year, 1917, shostakovich, s, musical, response, to, these, personal, crises, was, the, eighth, string, quartet, composed, in, only, three, days, he, subtitled, the, piece, to, the, victims, of, fascism, and, war, ostensibly, in, memory, of, the, dresden, fire, bombing, that, took, place, in, 1945, yet, like, the, tenth, symphony, the, quartet, incorporates, quotations, from, several, of, his, past, works, and, his, musical, monogram, shostakovich, confessed, to, his, friend, isaac, glikman, i, started, thinking, that, if, some, day, i, die, nobody, is, likely, to, write, a, work, in, memory, of, me, so, i, had, better, write, one, myself, several, of, shostakovich, s, colleagues, including, natalya, vovsi, mikhoels, and, the, cellist, valentin, berlinsky, were, also, aware, of, the, eighth, quartet, s, biographical, intent, peter, j, rabinowitz, has, also, pointed, to, covert, references, to, richard, strauss, s, metamorphosen, in, it, in, 1962, shostakovich, married, for, the, third, time, to, irina, supinskaya, in, a, letter, to, glikman, he, wrote, her, only, defect, is, that, she, is, 27, years, old, in, all, other, respects, she, is, splendid, clever, cheerful, straightforward, and, very, likeable, according, to, galina, vishnevskaya, who, knew, the, shostakoviches, well, this, marriage, was, a, very, happy, one, it, was, with, her, that, dmitri, dmitriyevich, finally, came, to, know, domestic, peace, surely, she, prolonged, his, life, by, several, years, in, november, he, conducted, publicly, for, the, only, time, in, his, life, leading, a, couple, of, his, own, works, in, gorky, otherwise, he, declined, to, conduct, citing, nerves, and, ill, health, that, year, saw, shostakovich, again, turn, to, the, subject, of, anti, semitism, in, his, thirteenth, symphony, subtitled, babi, yar, the, symphony, sets, a, number, of, poems, by, yevgeny, yevtushenko, the, first, of, which, commemorates, a, massacre, of, ukrainian, jews, during, the, second, world, war, opinions, are, divided, as, to, how, great, a, risk, this, was, the, poem, had, been, published, in, soviet, media, and, was, not, banned, but, it, remained, controversial, after, the, symphony, s, premiere, yevtushenko, was, forced, to, add, a, stanza, to, his, poem, that, said, that, russians, and, ukrainians, had, died, alongside, the, jews, at, babi, yar, in, 1965, shostakovich, raised, his, voice, in, defence, of, poet, joseph, brodsky, who, was, sentenced, to, five, years, of, exile, and, hard, labor, shostakovich, co, signed, protests, with, yevtushenko, fellow, soviet, artists, kornei, chukovsky, anna, akhmatova, samuil, marshak, and, the, french, philosopher, jean, paul, sartre, after, the, protests, the, sentence, was, commuted, and, brodsky, returned, to, leningrad, in, 1964, shostakovich, composed, the, music, for, the, russian, film, hamlet, which, was, favorably, reviewed, by, the, new, york, times, but, the, lack, of, this, aural, stimulation, of, shakespeare, s, eloquent, words, is, recompensed, in, some, measure, by, a, splendid, and, stirring, musical, score, by, dmitri, shostakovich, this, has, great, dignity, and, depth, and, at, times, an, appropriate, wildness, or, becoming, levity, in, later, life, shostakovich, suffered, from, chronic, ill, health, but, he, resisted, giving, up, cigarettes, and, vodka, beginning, in, 1958, he, suffered, from, a, debilitating, condition, that, particularly, affected, his, right, hand, eventually, forcing, him, to, give, up, piano, playing, in, 1965, it, was, diagnosed, as, poliomyelitis, but, consensus, on, his, diagnosis, is, unclear, he, also, suffered, heart, attacks, in, 1966, 1970, and, 1971, as, well, as, several, falls, in, which, he, broke, both, his, legs, in, 1967, he, wrote, in, a, letter, target, achieved, so, far, 75, right, leg, broken, left, leg, broken, right, hand, defective, all, i, need, to, do, now, is, wreck, the, left, hand, and, then, 100, of, my, extremities, will, be, out, of, order, a, preoccupation, with, his, own, mortality, permeates, shostakovich, s, later, works, such, as, the, later, quartets, and, the, fourteenth, symphony, of, 1969, a, song, cycle, based, on, a, number, of, poems, on, the, theme, of, death, he, dedicated, the, fourteenth, to, his, close, friend, benjamin, britten, who, conducted, its, western, premiere, at, the, 1970, aldeburgh, festival, the, fifteenth, symphony, of, 1971, is, by, contrast, melodic, and, retrospective, in, nature, quoting, wagner, rossini, and, the, composer, s, own, fourth, symphony, despite, suffering, from, motor, neurone, disease, als, or, some, other, neurological, ailment, from, as, early, as, the, 1950s, shostakovich, insisted, upon, writing, all, his, own, correspondence, and, music, himself, even, when, his, right, hand, became, virtually, unusable, his, last, work, was, his, viola, sonata, which, was, first, performed, officially, on, 1, october, 1975, shostakovich, a, smoker, since, his, youth, was, forced, to, give, up, the, habit, after, having, his, first, heart, attack, in, 1966, he, was, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, in, 1973, his, death, is, variously, attributed, to, lung, cancer, or, heart, failure, shostakovich, died, on, 9, august, 1975, at, the, central, clinical, hospital, in, moscow, a, civic, funeral, was, held, he, was, interred, in, novodevichy, cemetery, moscow, shostakovich, left, behind, several, recordings, of, his, own, piano, works, other, noted, interpreters, of, his, music, include, mstislav, rostropovich, tatiana, nikolayeva, maria, yudina, david, oistrakh, and, members, of, the, beethoven, quartet, shostakovich, s, influence, on, later, composers, outside, the, former, soviet, union, has, been, relatively, slight, his, influence, can, be, seen, in, some, nordic, composers, such, as, lars, erik, larsson, the, shostakovich, peninsula, on, alexander, island, antarctica, is, named, for, him, shostakovich, s, works, are, broadly, tonal, but, with, elements, of, atonality, and, chromaticism, in, some, of, his, later, works, e, g, the, twelfth, quartet, he, made, use, of, tone, rows, his, output, is, dominated, by, his, cycles, of, symphonies, and, string, quartets, each, totaling, 15, the, symphonies, are, distributed, fairly, evenly, throughout, his, career, while, the, quartets, are, concentrated, towards, the, latter, part, among, the, most, popular, are, the, fifth, and, seventh, symphonies, and, the, eighth, and, fifteenth, quartets, other, works, include, operas, concertos, chamber, music, and, a, large, quantity, of, theatre, and, film, music, shostakovich, s, music, shows, the, influence, of, many, of, the, composers, he, most, admired, bach, in, his, fugues, and, passacaglias, beethoven, in, the, late, quartets, mahler, in, the, symphonies, and, berg, in, his, use, of, musical, codes, and, quotations, among, russian, composers, he, particularly, admired, modest, mussorgsky, whose, operas, boris, godunov, and, khovanshchina, he, reorchestrated, mussorgsky, s, influence, is, most, prominent, in, the, wintry, scenes, of, lady, macbeth, and, the, eleventh, symphony, as, well, as, in, satirical, works, such, as, rayok, prokofiev, s, influence, is, most, apparent, in, the, earlier, piano, works, such, as, the, first, sonata, and, first, concerto, the, influence, of, russian, church, and, folk, music, is, evident, in, his, works, for, unaccompanied, choir, of, the, 1950s, shostakovich, s, relationship, with, stravinsky, was, profoundly, ambivalent, as, he, wrote, to, glikman, stravinsky, the, composer, i, worship, stravinsky, the, thinker, i, despise, he, was, particularly, enamoured, of, the, symphony, of, psalms, presenting, a, copy, of, his, own, piano, version, of, it, to, stravinsky, when, the, latter, visited, the, ussr, in, 1962, the, meeting, of, the, two, composers, was, not, very, successful, observers, commented, on, shostakovich, s, extreme, nervousness, and, stravinsky, s, cruelty, to, him, many, commentators, have, noted, the, disjunction, between, the, experimental, works, before, the, 1936, denunciation, and, the, more, conservative, ones, that, followed, the, composer, told, flora, litvinova, without, party, guidance, i, would, have, displayed, more, brilliance, used, more, sarcasm, i, could, have, revealed, my, ideas, openly, instead, of, having, to, resort, to, camouflage, articles, shostakovich, published, in, 1934, and, 1935, cited, berg, schoenberg, krenek, hindemith, and, especially, stravinsky, among, his, influences, key, works, of, the, earlier, period, are, the, first, symphony, which, combined, the, academicism, of, the, conservatory, with, his, progressive, inclinations, the, nose, the, most, uncompromisingly, modernist, of, all, his, stage, works, lady, macbeth, which, precipitated, the, denunciation, and, the, fourth, symphony, described, in, grove, s, dictionary, as, a, colossal, synthesis, of, shostakovich, s, musical, development, to, date, the, fourth, was, also, the, first, piece, in, which, mahler, s, influence, came, to, the, fore, prefiguring, the, route, shostakovich, took, to, secure, his, rehabilitation, while, he, himself, admitted, that, the, preceding, two, were, his, least, successful, after, 1936, shostakovich, s, music, became, more, conservative, during, this, time, he, also, composed, more, chamber, music, while, his, chamber, works, were, largely, tonal, the, late, chamber, works, which, grove, s, dictionary, calls, a, world, of, purgatorial, numbness, included, tone, rows, although, he, treated, these, thematically, rather, than, serially, vocal, works, are, also, a, prominent, feature, of, his, late, output, in, the, 1940s, shostakovich, began, to, show, an, interest, in, jewish, themes, he, was, intrigued, by, jewish, music, s, ability, to, build, a, jolly, melody, on, sad, intonations, examples, of, works, that, included, jewish, themes, are, the, fourth, string, quartet, 1949, the, first, violin, concerto, 1948, and, the, four, monologues, on, pushkin, poems, 1952, as, well, as, the, piano, trio, in, e, minor, 1944, he, was, further, inspired, to, write, with, jewish, themes, when, he, examined, moisei, beregovski, s, 1944, thesis, on, jewish, folk, music, in, 1948, shostakovich, acquired, a, book, of, jewish, folk, songs, from, which, he, composed, the, song, cycle, from, jewish, folk, poetry, he, initially, wrote, eight, songs, meant, to, represent, the, hardships, of, being, jewish, in, the, soviet, union, to, disguise, this, he, added, three, more, meant, to, demonstrate, the, great, life, jews, had, under, the, soviet, regime, despite, his, efforts, to, hide, the, real, meaning, in, the, work, the, union, of, composers, refused, to, approve, his, music, in, 1949, under, the, pressure, of, the, anti, semitism, that, gripped, the, country, from, jewish, folk, poetry, could, not, be, performed, until, after, stalin, s, death, in, march, 1953, along, with, all, the, other, works, that, were, forbidden, throughout, his, compositions, shostakovich, demonstrated, a, controlled, use, of, musical, quotation, this, stylistic, choice, had, been, common, among, earlier, composers, but, shostakovich, developed, it, into, a, defining, characteristic, of, his, music, rather, than, quoting, other, composers, shostakovich, preferred, to, quote, himself, musicologists, such, as, sofia, moshevich, ian, mcdonald, and, stephen, harris, have, connected, his, works, through, their, quotations, one, example, is, the, main, theme, of, katerina, s, aria, seryozha, khoroshiy, moy, from, the, fourth, act, of, lady, macbeth, of, the, mtsensk, district, the, aria, s, beauty, comes, as, a, breath, of, fresh, air, in, the, intense, overbearing, tone, of, the, scene, in, which, katerina, visits, her, lover, sergei, in, prison, the, theme, is, made, tragic, when, sergei, betrays, her, and, finds, a, new, lover, upon, blaming, katerina, for, his, incarceration, more, than, 25, years, later, shostakovich, quoted, this, theme, in, his, eighth, string, quartet, in, the, midst, of, this, quartet, s, oppressive, and, somber, themes, the, cello, introduces, the, seryozha, theme, in, the, bright, key, of, f, sharp, major, about, three, minutes, into, the, fourth, movement, this, theme, emerges, once, again, in, his, fourteenth, string, quartet, as, in, the, eighth, quartet, the, cello, introduces, the, theme, which, here, serves, as, a, dedication, to, the, cellist, of, the, beethoven, string, quartet, sergei, shirinsky, in, 2004, the, musicologist, olga, digonskaya, discovered, a, trove, of, shostakovich, manuscripts, at, the, glinka, state, central, museum, of, musical, culture, in, moscow, in, a, cardboard, file, were, some, 300, pages, of, musical, sketches, pieces, and, scores, in, shostakovich, s, hand, a, composer, friend, bribed, shostakovich, s, housemaid, to, regularly, deliver, the, contents, of, shostakovich, s, office, waste, bin, to, him, instead, of, taking, it, to, the, garbage, some, of, those, cast, offs, eventually, found, their, way, into, the, glinka, the, glinka, archive, contained, a, huge, number, of, pieces, and, compositions, which, were, completely, unknown, or, could, be, traced, quite, indirectly, digonskaya, said, among, these, were, shostakovich, s, piano, and, vocal, sketches, for, a, prologue, to, an, opera, orango, 1932, they, were, orchestrated, by, the, british, composer, gerard, mcburney, and, premiered, in, december, 2011, by, the, los, angeles, philharmonic, conducted, by, esa, pekka, salonen, according, to, mcburney, opinion, is, divided, on, whether, shostakovich, s, music, is, of, visionary, power, and, originality, as, some, maintain, or, as, others, think, derivative, trashy, empty, and, second, hand, william, walton, his, british, contemporary, described, him, as, the, greatest, composer, of, the, 20th, century, musicologist, david, fanning, concludes, in, grove, s, dictionary, that, amid, the, conflicting, pressures, of, official, requirements, the, mass, suffering, of, his, fellow, countrymen, and, his, personal, ideals, of, humanitarian, and, public, service, he, succeeded, in, forging, a, musical, language, of, colossal, emotional, power, some, modern, composers, have, been, critical, pierre, boulez, dismissed, shostakovich, s, music, as, the, second, or, even, third, pressing, of, mahler, the, romanian, composer, and, webern, disciple, philip, gershkovich, called, shostakovich, a, hack, in, a, trance, a, related, complaint, is, that, shostakovich, s, style, is, vulgar, and, strident, stravinsky, wrote, of, lady, macbeth, brutally, hammering, and, monotonous, english, composer, and, musicologist, robin, holloway, described, his, music, as, battleship, grey, in, melody, and, harmony, factory, functional, in, structure, in, content, all, rhetoric, and, coercion, in, the, 1980s, the, finnish, conductor, and, composer, esa, pekka, salonen, was, critical, of, shostakovich, and, refused, to, conduct, his, music, for, instance, he, said, in, 1987, shostakovich, is, in, many, ways, a, polar, counter, force, for, stravinsky, when, i, have, said, that, the, 7th, symphony, of, shostakovich, is, a, dull, and, unpleasant, composition, people, have, responded, yes, yes, but, think, of, the, background, of, that, symphony, such, an, attitude, does, no, good, to, anyone, salonen, has, since, performed, and, recorded, several, of, shostakovich, s, works, including, leading, the, world, premiere, of, orango, but, has, dismissed, the, fifth, symphony, as, overrated, adding, that, he, was, very, suspicious, of, heroic, things, in, general, shostakovich, borrows, extensively, from, the, material, and, styles, both, of, earlier, composers, and, of, popular, music, the, vulgarity, of, low, music, is, a, notable, influence, on, this, greatest, of, eclectics, mcburney, traces, this, to, the, avant, garde, artistic, circles, of, the, early, soviet, period, in, which, shostakovich, moved, early, in, his, career, and, argues, that, these, borrowings, were, a, deliberate, technique, to, allow, him, to, create, patterns, of, contrast, repetition, exaggeration, that, gave, his, music,
