and, retire, on, the, proceeds, eiffel, was, not, a, studious, child, and, thought, his, classes, at, the, lyc, e, royal, in, dijon, boring, and, a, waste, of, time, although, in, his, last, two, years, influenced, by, his, teachers, for, history, and, literature, he, began, to, study, seriously, and, he, gained, his, baccalaur, ats, in, humanities, and, science, an, important, part, in, his, education, was, played, by, his, uncle, jean, baptiste, mollerat, who, had, invented, a, process, for, distilling, vinegar, and, had, a, large, chemical, works, near, dijon, and, one, of, his, uncle, s, friends, the, chemist, michel, perret, both, men, spent, a, lot, of, time, with, the, young, eiffel, teaching, him, about, everything, from, chemistry, and, mining, to, theology, and, philosophy, eiffel, went, on, to, attend, the, coll, ge, sainte, barbe, in, paris, to, prepare, for, the, difficult, entrance, exams, set, by, engineering, colleges, in, france, and, qualified, for, entry, to, two, of, the, most, prestigious, schools, cole, polytechnique, and, cole, centrale, des, arts, et, manufactures, and, ultimately, entered, the, latter, during, his, second, year, he, chose, to, specialize, in, chemistry, and, graduated, ranking, at, 13th, place, out, of, 80, candidates, in, 1855, this, was, the, year, that, paris, hosted, a, world, s, fair, and, eiffel, was, bought, a, season, ticket, by, his, mother, after, graduation, eiffel, had, hoped, to, find, work, in, his, uncle, s, workshop, in, dijon, but, a, family, dispute, made, this, impossible, after, a, few, months, working, as, an, unpaid, assistant, to, his, brother, in, law, who, managed, a, foundry, eiffel, approached, the, railway, engineer, charles, nepveu, who, gave, eiffel, his, first, paid, job, as, his, private, secretary, however, shortly, afterwards, nepveu, s, company, went, bankrupt, nepveu, found, eiffel, a, job, designing, a, 22, m, 72, ft, sheet, iron, bridge, for, the, saint, germaine, railway, some, of, nepveu, s, businesses, were, then, acquired, by, the, compagnie, belge, de, mat, riels, de, chemin, de, fer, nepveu, was, appointed, the, managing, director, of, the, two, factories, in, paris, and, offered, eiffel, a, job, as, head, of, the, research, department, in, 1857, nepveu, negotiated, a, contract, to, build, a, railway, bridge, over, the, river, garonne, at, bordeaux, connecting, the, paris, bordeaux, line, to, the, lines, running, to, s, te, and, bayonne, which, involved, the, construction, of, a, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, iron, girder, bridge, supported, by, six, pairs, of, masonry, piers, on, the, river, bed, these, were, constructed, with, the, aid, of, compressed, air, caissons, and, hydraulic, rams, both, innovative, techniques, at, the, time, eiffel, was, initially, given, the, responsibility, of, assembling, the, metalwork, and, eventually, took, over, the, management, of, the, entire, project, from, nepveu, who, resigned, in, march, 1860, following, the, completion, of, the, project, on, schedule, eiffel, was, appointed, as, the, principal, engineer, of, the, compagnie, belge, his, work, had, also, gained, the, attention, of, several, people, who, were, later, to, give, him, work, including, stanislas, de, la, roche, toulay, who, had, prepared, the, design, for, the, metalwork, of, the, bordeaux, bridge, jean, baptiste, krantz, and, wilhelm, nordling, further, promotion, within, the, company, followed, but, the, business, began, to, decline, and, in, 1865, eiffel, seeing, no, future, there, resigned, and, set, up, as, an, independent, consulting, engineer, he, was, already, working, independently, on, the, construction, of, two, railway, stations, at, toulouse, and, agen, and, in, 1866, he, was, given, a, contract, to, oversee, the, construction, of, 33, locomotives, for, the, egyptian, government, a, profitable, but, undemanding, job, in, the, course, of, which, he, visited, egypt, where, he, visited, the, suez, canal, which, was, being, constructed, by, ferdinand, de, lesseps, at, the, same, time, he, was, employed, by, jean, baptiste, kranz, to, assist, him, in, the, design, of, the, exhibition, hall, for, the, exposition, universelle, which, was, to, be, held, in, 1867, eiffel, s, principal, job, was, to, draw, up, the, arch, girders, of, the, galerie, des, machines, in, order, to, carry, out, this, work, eiffel, and, henri, treca, the, director, of, the, conservatoire, des, arts, et, metiers, conducted, valuable, research, on, the, structural, properties, of, cast, iron, definitively, establishing, the, modulus, of, elasticity, applicable, to, compound, castings, at, the, end, of, 1866, eiffel, managed, to, borrow, enough, cash, to, set, up, his, own, workshops, at, 48, rue, fouquet, in, levallois, perret, his, first, important, commission, was, for, two, viaducts, for, the, railway, line, between, lyon, and, bordeaux, and, the, company, also, began, to, undertake, work, in, other, countries, including, st, mark, s, cathedral, in, arica, peru, which, was, an, all, metal, prefabricated, building, manufactured, in, france, and, shipped, to, south, america, in, pieces, to, be, assembled, on, site, first, it, was, intended, for, the, city, of, anc, n, a, beach, near, lima, but, the, peruvian, government, of, president, jos, balta, changed, the, final, destination, to, arica, because, the, old, church, was, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, on, 13, august, 1868, because, of, this, a, committee, of, ladies, of, arica, asked, balta, to, relocate, eiffel, s, structure, to, arica, on, 6, october, 1868, he, entered, into, partnership, with, th, ophile, seyrig, a, fellow, graduate, of, the, cole, centrale, forming, the, company, eiffel, et, cie, in, 1875, eiffel, et, cie, were, given, two, important, contracts, one, for, the, budapest, nyugati, railway, station, for, the, vienna, to, budapest, railway, and, the, other, for, a, bridge, over, the, river, douro, in, portugal, the, station, in, budapest, was, an, innovative, design, the, usual, pattern, for, building, a, railway, terminus, was, to, conceal, the, metal, structure, behind, an, elaborate, facade, eiffel, s, design, for, budapest, used, the, metal, structure, as, the, centerpiece, of, the, building, flanked, on, either, side, by, conventional, stone, and, brick, clad, structures, housing, administrative, offices, the, bridge, over, the, douro, came, about, as, the, result, of, a, competition, held, by, the, royal, portuguese, railroad, company, the, task, was, a, demanding, one, the, river, was, fast, flowing, up, to, 20, m, 66, ft, deep, and, had, a, bed, formed, of, a, deep, layer, of, gravel, which, made, the, construction, of, piers, on, the, river, bed, impossible, and, so, the, bridge, had, to, have, a, central, span, of, 160, m, 520, ft, this, was, greater, than, the, longest, arch, span, which, had, been, built, at, the, time, eiffel, s, proposal, was, for, a, bridge, whose, deck, was, supported, by, five, iron, piers, with, the, abutments, of, the, pair, on, the, river, bank, also, bearing, a, central, supporting, arch, the, price, quoted, by, eiffel, was, ff, 965, 000, far, below, the, nearest, competitor, and, so, he, was, given, the, job, although, since, his, company, was, less, experienced, than, his, rivals, the, portuguese, authorities, appointed, a, committee, to, report, on, eiffel, et, cie, s, suitability, the, members, included, jean, baptiste, krantz, henri, dion, and, l, on, molinos, both, of, whom, had, known, eiffel, for, a, long, time, their, report, was, favorable, and, eiffel, got, the, job, on, site, work, began, in, january, 1876, and, was, complete, by, the, end, of, october, 1877, the, bridge, was, ceremonially, opened, by, king, lu, s, i, and, queen, maria, pia, after, whom, the, bridge, was, named, on, 4, november, the, exposition, universelle, in, 1878, firmly, established, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, leading, engineers, of, the, time, as, well, as, exhibiting, models, and, drawings, of, work, undertaken, by, the, company, eiffel, was, also, responsible, for, the, construction, of, several, of, the, exhibition, buildings, one, of, these, a, pavilion, for, the, paris, gas, company, was, eiffel, s, first, collaboration, with, stephen, sauvestre, who, was, later, to, become, the, head, of, the, company, s, architectural, office, in, 1879, the, partnership, with, seyrig, was, dissolved, and, the, company, was, renamed, the, compagnie, des, tablissements, eiffel, the, same, year, the, company, was, given, the, contract, for, the, garabit, viaduct, a, railway, bridge, near, ruynes, en, margeride, in, the, cantal, d, partement, like, the, douro, bridge, the, project, involved, a, lengthy, viaduct, crossing, the, river, valley, as, well, as, the, river, itself, and, eiffel, was, given, the, job, without, any, process, of, competitive, tendering, due, to, his, success, with, the, bridge, over, the, douro, to, assist, him, in, the, work, he, took, on, several, people, who, were, to, play, important, roles, in, the, design, and, construction, of, the, eiffel, tower, including, maurice, koechlin, a, young, graduate, of, the, zurich, polytechnikum, who, was, engaged, to, undertake, calculations, and, make, drawings, and, mile, nouguier, who, had, previously, worked, for, eiffel, on, the, construction, of, the, douro, bridge, the, same, year, eiffel, started, work, on, a, system, of, standardised, prefabricated, bridges, an, idea, that, was, the, result, of, a, conversation, with, the, governor, of, cochin, china, these, used, a, small, number, of, standard, components, all, small, enough, to, be, readily, transportable, in, areas, with, poor, or, non, existent, roads, and, were, joined, using, bolts, rather, than, rivets, reducing, the, need, for, skilled, labour, on, site, a, number, of, different, types, were, produced, ranging, from, footbridges, to, standard, gauge, railway, bridges, in, 1881, eiffel, was, contacted, by, auguste, bartholdi, who, was, in, need, of, an, engineer, to, help, him, to, realise, the, statue, of, liberty, some, work, had, already, been, carried, out, by, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, but, he, had, died, in, 1879, eiffel, was, selected, because, of, his, experience, with, wind, stresses, eiffel, devised, a, structure, consisting, of, a, four, legged, pylon, to, support, the, copper, sheeting, which, made, up, the, body, of, the, statue, the, entire, statue, was, erected, at, the, eiffel, works, in, paris, before, being, dismantled, and, shipped, to, the, united, states, in, 1886, eiffel, also, designed, the, dome, for, the, astronomical, observatory, in, nice, this, was, the, most, important, building, in, a, complex, designed, by, charles, garnier, later, among, the, most, prominent, critics, of, the, tower, the, dome, with, a, diameter, of, 22, 4, m, 73, ft, was, the, largest, in, the, world, when, built, and, used, an, ingenious, bearing, device, rather, than, running, on, wheels, or, rollers, it, was, supported, by, a, ring, shaped, hollow, girder, floating, in, a, circular, trough, containing, a, solution, of, magnesium, chloride, in, water, this, had, been, patented, by, eiffel, in, 1881, the, design, of, the, eiffel, tower, was, originated, by, maurice, koechlin, and, emile, nouguier, who, had, discussed, ideas, for, a, centrepiece, for, the, 1889, exposition, universelle, in, may, 1884, koechlin, working, at, his, home, made, an, outline, drawing, of, their, scheme, described, by, him, as, a, great, pylon, consisting, of, four, lattice, girders, standing, apart, at, the, base, and, coming, together, at, the, top, joined, together, by, metal, trusses, at, regular, intervals, initially, eiffel, showed, little, enthusiasm, although, he, did, sanction, further, study, of, the, project, and, the, two, engineers, then, asked, stephen, sauvestre, to, add, architectural, embellishments, sauvestre, added, the, decorative, arches, to, the, base, a, glass, pavilion, to, the, first, level, and, the, cupola, at, the, top, the, enhanced, idea, gained, eiffel, s, support, for, the, project, and, he, bought, the, rights, to, the, patent, on, the, design, which, koechlin, nougier, and, sauvestre, had, taken, out, the, design, was, exhibited, at, the, exhibition, of, decorative, arts, in, the, autumn, of, 1884, and, on, 30, march, 1885, eiffel, read, a, paper, on, the, project, to, the, soci, t, des, ing, nieurs, civils, after, discussing, the, technical, problems, and, emphasising, the, practical, uses, of, the, tower, he, finished, his, talk, by, saying, that, the, tower, would, symbolise, not, only, the, art, of, the, modern, engineer, but, also, the, century, of, industry, and, science, in, which, we, are, living, and, for, which, the, way, was, prepared, by, the, great, scientific, movement, of, the, eighteenth, century, and, by, the, revolution, of, 1789, to, which, this, monument, will, be, built, as, an, expression, of, france, s, gratitude, little, happened, until, the, beginning, of, 1886, but, with, the, re, election, of, jules, gr, vy, as, president, and, his, appointment, of, edouard, lockroy, as, minister, for, trade, decisions, began, to, be, made, a, budget, for, the, exposition, was, passed, and, on, 1, may, lockroy, announced, an, alteration, to, the, terms, of, the, open, competition, which, was, being, held, for, a, centerpiece, for, the, exposition, which, effectively, made, the, choice, of, eiffel, s, design, a, foregone, conclusion, all, entries, had, to, include, a, study, for, a, 300, m, 980, ft, four, sided, metal, tower, on, the, champ, de, mars, on, 12, may, a, commission, was, set, up, to, examine, eiffel, s, scheme, and, its, rivals, and, on, 12, june, it, presented, its, decision, which, was, that, only, eiffel, s, proposal, met, their, requirements, after, some, debate, about, the, exact, site, for, the, tower, a, contract, was, signed, on, 8, january, 1887, this, was, signed, by, eiffel, acting, in, his, own, capacity, rather, than, as, the, representative, of, his, company, and, granted, him, one, and, a, half, million, francs, toward, the, construction, costs, this, was, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, estimated, cost, of, six, and, a, half, million, francs, eiffel, was, to, receive, all, income, from, the, commercial, exploitation, during, the, exhibition, and, for, the, following, twenty, years, eiffel, later, established, a, separate, company, to, manage, the, tower, the, tower, had, been, a, subject, of, some, controversy, attracting, criticism, both, from, those, who, did, not, believe, it, feasible, and, from, those, who, objected, on, artistic, grounds, just, as, work, began, at, the, champ, de, mars, the, committee, of, three, hundred, one, member, for, each, metre, of, the, tower, s, height, was, formed, led, by, charles, garnier, and, including, some, of, the, most, important, figures, of, the, french, arts, establishment, including, adolphe, bouguereau, guy, de, maupassant, charles, gounod, and, jules, massenet, a, petition, was, sent, to, jean, charles, adolphe, alphand, the, minister, of, works, and, was, published, by, le, temps, to, bring, our, arguments, home, imagine, for, a, moment, a, giddy, ridiculous, tower, dominating, paris, like, a, gigantic, black, smokestack, crushing, under, its, barbaric, bulk, notre, dame, the, tour, saint, jacques, the, louvre, the, dome, of, les, invalides, the, arc, de, triomphe, all, of, our, humiliated, monuments, will, disappear, in, this, ghastly, dream, and, for, twenty, years, we, shall, see, stretching, like, a, blot, of, ink, the, hateful, shadow, of, the, hateful, column, of, bolted, sheet, metal, work, on, the, foundations, started, on, 28, january, 1887, those, for, the, east, and, south, legs, were, straightforward, each, leg, resting, on, four, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, concrete, slabs, one, for, each, of, the, principal, girders, of, each, leg, but, the, other, two, being, closer, to, the, river, seine, were, more, complicated, each, slab, needed, two, piles, installed, by, using, compressed, air, caissons, 15, m, 49, ft, long, and, 6, m, 20, ft, in, diameter, driven, to, a, depth, of, 22, m, 72, ft, to, support, the, concrete, slabs, which, were, 6, m, 20, ft, thick, each, of, these, slabs, supported, a, limestone, block, each, with, an, inclined, top, to, bear, the, supporting, shoe, for, the, ironwork, these, shoes, were, anchored, by, bolts, 10, cm, 4, in, in, diameter, and, 7, 5, m, 25, ft, long, work, on, the, foundations, was, complete, by, 30, june, and, the, erection, of, the, iron, work, was, started, although, no, more, than, 250, men, were, employed, on, the, site, a, prodigious, amount, of, exacting, preparatory, work, was, entailed, the, drawing, office, produced, 1, 700, general, drawings, and, 3, 629, detail, drawings, of, the, 18, 038, different, parts, needed, the, task, of, drawing, the, components, was, complicated, by, the, complex, angles, involved, in, the, design, and, the, degree, of, precision, required, the, positions, of, rivet, holes, were, specified, to, within, 0, 1, mm, 0, 004, in, and, angles, worked, out, to, one, second, of, arc, the, components, some, already, riveted, together, into, sub, assemblies, were, first, bolted, together, the, bolts, being, replaced, by, rivets, as, construction, progressed, no, drilling, or, shaping, was, done, on, site, if, any, part, did, not, fit, it, was, sent, back, to, the, factory, for, alteration, the, four, legs, each, at, an, angle, of, 54, to, the, ground, were, initially, constructed, as, cantilevers, relying, on, the, anchoring, bolts, in, the, masonry, foundation, blocks, eiffel, had, calculated, that, this, would, be, satisfactory, until, they, approached, halfway, to, the, first, level, accordingly, work, was, stopped, for, the, purpose, of, erecting, a, wooden, supporting, scaffold, this, gave, ammunition, to, his, critics, and, lurid, headlines, including, eiffel, suicide, and, gustave, eiffel, has, gone, mad, he, has, been, confined, in, an, asylum, appeared, in, the, popular, press, at, this, stage, a, small, creeper, crane, was, installed, in, each, leg, designed, to, move, up, the, tower, as, construction, progressed, and, making, use, of, the, guides, for, the, elevators, which, were, to, be, fitted, in, each, leg, after, this, brief, pause, erection, of, the, metalwork, continued, and, the, critical, operation, of, linking, the, four, legs, was, successfully, completed, by, march, 1888, in, order, to, precisely, align, the, legs, so, that, the, connecting, girders, could, be, put, into, place, a, provision, had, been, made, to, enable, precise, adjustments, by, placing, hydraulic, jacks, in, the, footings, for, each, of, the, girders, making, up, the, legs, the, main, structural, work, was, completed, at, the, end, of, march, 1889, and, on, 31, march, eiffel, celebrated, by, leading, a, group, of, government, officials, accompanied, by, representatives, of, the, press, to, the, top, of, the, tower, since, the, lifts, were, not, yet, in, operation, the, ascent, was, made, by, foot, and, took, over, an, hour, eiffel, frequently, stopping, to, make, explanations, of, various, features, most, of, the, party, chose, to, stop, at, the, lower, levels, but, a, few, including, nouguier, compagnon, the, president, of, the, city, council, and, reporters, from, le, figaro, and, le, monde, illustr, completed, the, climb, at, 2, 35, eiffel, hoisted, a, large, tricolour, to, the, accompaniment, of, a, 25, gun, salute, fired, from, the, lower, level, in, 1887, eiffel, became, involved, with, the, french, effort, to, construct, a, canal, across, the, panama, isthmus, the, french, panama, canal, company, headed, by, ferdinand, de, lesseps, had, been, attempting, to, build, a, sea, level, canal, but, came, to, the, realization, that, this, was, impractical, the, plan, was, changed, to, one, using, locks, which, eiffel, was, contracted, to, design, and, build, the, locks, were, on, a, large, scale, most, having, a, change, of, level, of, 11, m, 36, ft, eiffel, had, been, working, on, the, project, for, little, more, than, a, year, when, the, company, suspended, payments, of, interest, on, 14, december, 1888, and, shortly, afterwards, was, put, into, liquidation, eiffel, s, reputation, was, badly, damaged, when, he, was, implicated, in, the, financial, and, political, scandal, which, followed, although, he, was, simply, a, contractor, he, was, charged, along, with, the, directors, of, the, project, with, raising, money, under, false, pretenses, and, misappropriation, of, funds, on, 9, february, 1893, eiffel, was, found, guilty, on, the, charge, of, misuse, of, funds, and, was, fined, 20, 000, francs, and, sentenced, to, two, years, in, prison, although, he, was, acquitted, on, appeal, the, later, american, built, canal, used, new, lock, designs, see, history, of, the, panama, canal, shortly, before, the, trial, eiffel, had, announced, his, intention, to, resign, from, the, board, of, directors, of, the, compagnie, des, etablissements, eiffel, and, did, so, at, a, general, meeting, held, on, 14, february, saying, i, have, absolutely, decided, to, abstain, from, any, participation, in, any, manufacturing, business, from, now, on, and, so, that, no, one, can, be, misled, and, to, make, it, most, evident, i, intend, to, remain, uninvolved, with, the, establishments, that, bears, my, name, and, insist, that, it, be, removed, from, the, company, s, name, the, company, changed, its, name, to, la, soci, t, constructions, levallois, perret, with, maurice, koechlin, as, managing, director, the, name, was, changed, to, the, anciens, etablissements, eiffel, in, 1937, after, his, retirement, from, the, compagnie, des, etablissements, eiffel, eiffel, went, on, to, do, important, work, in, meteorology, and, aerodynamics, eiffel, s, interest, in, these, areas, was, a, consequence, of, the, problems, he, had, encountered, with, the, effects, of, wind, forces, on, the, structures, he, had, built, his, first, aerodynamic, experiments, investigating, the, air, resistance, of, surfaces, were, carried, out, by, dropping, the, surface, to, be, investigated, together, with, a, measuring, apparatus, down, a, vertical, cable, stretched, between, the, second, level, of, the, eiffel, tower, and, the, ground, using, this, eiffel, definitely, established, that, the, air, resistance, of, a, body, was, very, closely, related, to, the, square, of, the, airspeed, he, then, built, a, laboratory, on, the, champ, de, mars, at, the, foot, of, the, tower, in, 1905, building, his, first, wind, tunnel, there, in, 1909, the, wind, tunnel, was, used, to, investigate, the, characteristics, of, the, airfoil, sections, used, by, the, early, pioneers, of, aviation, such, as, the, wright, brothers, gabriel, voisin, and, louis, bl, riot, eiffel, established, that, the, lift, produced, by, an, airfoil, was, the, result, of, a, reduction, of, air, pressure, above, the, wing, rather, than, an, increase, of, pressure, acting, on, the, under, surface, following, complaints, about, noise, from, people, living, nearby, he, moved, his, experiments, to, a, new, establishment, at, auteuil, in, 1912, here, it, was, possible, to, build, a, larger, wind, tunnel, and, eiffel, began, to, make, tests, using, scale, models, of, aircraft, designs, in, 1913, eiffel, was, awarded, the, samuel, p, langley, medal, for, aerodromics, by, the, smithsonian, institution, in, his, speech, at, the, presentation, of, the, medal, alexander, graham, bell, said, his, writings, upon, the, resistance, of, the, air, have, already, become, classical, his, researches, published, in, 1907, and, 1911, on, the, resistance, of, the, air, in, connection, with, aviation, are, especially, valuable, they, have, given, engineers, the, data, for, designing, and, constructing, flying, machines, upon, sound, scientific, principles, eiffel, had, meteorological, measuring, equipment, placed, on, the, tower, in, 1889, and, also, built, a, weather, station, at, his, house, in, s, vres, between, 1891, and, 1892, he, compiled, a, complete, set, of, meteorological, readings, and, later, extended, his, record, taking, to, include, measurements, from, 25, different, locations, across, france, eiffel, died, on, 27, december, 1923, while, listening, to, beethoven, s, 5th, symphony, andante, in, his, mansion, on, rue, rabelais, in, paris, he, was, buried, in, the, family, tomb, in, levallois, perret, cemetery, gustave, eiffel, s, career, was, a, result, of, the, industrial, revolution, for, a, variety, of, economic, and, political, reasons, this, had, been, slow, to, make, an, impact, in, france, and, eiffel, had, the, good, fortune, to, be, working, at, a, time, of, rapid, industrial, development, in, france, eiffel, s, importance, as, an, engineer, was, twofold, firstly, he, was, ready, to, adopt, innovative, techniques, first, used, by, others, such, as, his, use, of, compressed, air, caissons, and, hollow, cast, iron, piers, and, secondly, he, was, a, pioneer, in, his, insistence, on, basing, all, engineering, decisions, on, thorough, calculation, of, the, forces, involved, combining, this, analytical, approach, with, an, insistence, on, a, high, standard, of, accuracy, in, drawing, and, manufacture, the, growth, of, the, railway, network, had, an, immense, effect, on, people, s, lives, but, although, the, enormous, number, of, bridges, and, other, work, undertaken, by, eiffel, were, an, important, part, of, this, the, two, works, that, did, most, to, make, him, famous, are, the, statue, of, liberty, and, the, eiffel, tower, both, projects, of, immense, symbolic, importance, and, today, internationally, recognized, landmarks, the, tower, is, also, important, because, of, its, role, in, establishing, the, aesthetic, potential, of, structures, whose, appearance, is, largely, dictated, by, practical, considerations, his, contribution, to, the, science, of, aerodynamics, is, probably, of, equal, importance, to, his, work, as, an, engineer, a, number, of, works, of, gustave, eiffel, are, in, danger, today, some, have, already, been, destroyed, like, in, vietnam, a, proposal, to, demolish, the, railway, bridge, of, bordeaux, also, known, as, the, passerelle, st, jean, the, first, major, work, of, gustave, eiffel, resulted, in, a, large, response, from, the, public, actions, to, protect, the, bridge, were, taken, as, early, as, 2002, by, the, association, of, the, descendants, of, gustave, eiffel, joined, from, 2005, onwards, by, the, association, sauvons, la, passerelle, eiffel, save, the, eiffel, bridge, they, led, in, 2010, to, the, decision, to, list, eiffel, s, bordeaux, bridge, as, a, french, historical, monument
