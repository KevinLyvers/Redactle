he, was, frequently, ill, and, is, believed, to, have, had, epilepsy, charles, twice, purchased, peace, with, viking, raiders, including, at, the, infamous, siege, of, paris, which, led, to, his,

death, splintering, into, five, separate, successor, kingdoms, the, territory, it, had, occupied, was, not, entirely, reunited, under, one, ruler, until, the, conquests, of, napoleon, the, nickname, charles, the, fat, latin, carolus, crassus, is, not, contemporary, it, was, first, used, by, the, annalista, saxo, the, anonymous, saxon, annalist, in, the, twelfth, century, there, is, no, contemporary, reference, to, charles, s, physical, size, but, the, nickname, has, stuck, and, is, the, common, name, in, most, modern, european, languages, french, charles, le, gros, german, karl, der, dicke, italian, carlo, il, grosso, his, numeral, is, roughly, contemporary, regino, of, pr, m, a, contemporary, of, charles, s, recording, his, death, calls, him, emperor, charles, third, of, that, name, and, dignity, latin, carolus, imperator, tertius, huius, nominis, et, dignitatis, charles, was, the, youngest, of, the, three, sons, of, louis, the, german, first, king, of, east, francia, and, hemma, from, the, house, of, welf, an, incident, of, demonic, possession, is, recorded, in, his, youth, in, which, he, was, said, to, have, been, foaming, at, the, mouth, before, he, was, taken, to, the, altar, of, the, church, this, greatly, affected, him, and, his, father, he, was, described, as, a, very, christian, prince, fearing, god, with, all, his, heart, keeping, his, commandments, very, devoutly, obeying, the, orders, of, the, church, generous, in, alms, giving, practising, unceasingly, prayer, and, song, always, intent, upon, celebrating, the, praises, of, god, in, 859, charles, was, made, count, of, the, breisgau, an, alemannic, march, bordering, southern, lotharingia, in, 863, his, rebellious, eldest, brother, carloman, revolted, against, their, father, the, next, year, louis, the, younger, followed, carloman, in, revolt, and, charles, joined, him, carloman, received, rule, over, the, duchy, of, bavaria, in, 865, the, elder, louis, was, forced, to, divide, his, remaining, lands, among, his, heirs, the, duchy, of, saxony, along, with, the, duchy, of, franconia, and, the, duchy, of, thuringia, went, to, louis, alemannia, the, duchy, of, swabia, along, with, rhaetia, went, to, charles, and, lotharingia, was, to, be, divided, between, the, younger, two, when, in, 875, the, emperor, louis, ii, who, was, also, king, of, italy, died, having, agreed, with, louis, the, german, that, carloman, would, succeed, him, in, italy, charles, the, bald, of, west, francia, invaded, the, peninsula, and, had, himself, crowned, king, and, emperor, louis, the, german, sent, first, charles, and, then, carloman, himself, with, armies, containing, italian, forces, under, berengar, of, friuli, their, cousin, to, the, italian, kingdom, these, wars, however, were, not, successful, until, the, death, of, charles, the, bald, in, 877, in, 876, louis, the, german, died, and, the, inheritance, was, divided, as, planned, after, a, conference, at, ries, though, charles, received, less, of, his, share, of, lotharingia, than, planned, in, his, charters, charles, s, reign, in, germania, is, dated, from, his, inheritance, in, 876, three, brothers, ruled, in, cooperation, and, avoided, wars, over, the, division, of, their, patrimony, a, rare, occurrence, in, the, early, middle, ages, in, 877, carloman, finally, inherited, italy, from, his, uncle, charles, the, bald, louis, divided, lotharingia, and, offered, a, third, to, carloman, and, a, third, to, charles, in, 878, carloman, returned, his, lotharingian, share, to, louis, who, then, divided, it, evenly, with, charles, in, 879, carloman, was, incapacitated, by, a, stroke, and, divided, his, domains, between, his, brothers, bavaria, went, to, louis, and, italy, to, charles, charles, dated, his, reign, in, italia, from, this, point, and, from, then, he, spent, most, of, his, reign, until, 886, in, his, italian, kingdom, in, 880, charles, joined, louis, iii, of, france, and, carloman, ii, the, joint, kings, of, west, francia, in, a, failed, siege, of, boso, of, provence, in, vienne, from, august, to, september, provence, legally, a, part, of, the, italian, kingdom, from, 863, had, rebelled, under, boso, in, august, 882, charles, sent, richard, duke, of, burgundy, count, of, autun, to, take, the, city, which, he, finally, did, in, september, after, this, boso, was, restricted, to, the, vicinity, of, vienne, on, 18, july, 880, pope, john, viii, sent, a, letter, to, guy, ii, of, spoleto, seeking, peace, but, the, duke, ignored, him, and, invaded, the, papal, states, john, responded, by, begging, the, aid, of, charles, in, his, capacity, as, king, of, italy, and, crowned, charles, emperor, on, 12, february, 881, this, was, accompanied, by, hopes, of, a, general, revival, in, western, europe, but, charles, proved, to, be, unequal, to, the, task, charles, did, little, to, help, against, guy, ii, papal, letters, as, late, as, november, were, still, petitioning, charles, for, action, as, emperor, charles, began, the, construction, of, a, palace, at, s, lestat, in, alsace, he, modelled, it, after, the, palace, at, aachen, which, was, built, by, charlemagne, whom, he, consciously, sought, to, emulate, as, indicated, by, the, gesta, karoli, magni, of, notker, the, stammerer, as, aachen, was, located, in, the, kingdom, of, his, brother, it, was, necessary, for, charles, to, build, a, new, palace, for, his, court, in, his, own, power, base, of, western, alemannia, s, lestat, was, also, more, centrally, located, than, aachen, in, february, 882, charles, convoked, a, diet, in, ravenna, the, duke, emperor, and, pope, made, peace, and, guy, and, his, uncle, guy, of, camerino, vowed, to, return, the, papal, lands, in, a, march, letter, to, charles, john, claimed, that, the, vows, went, unfulfilled, in, 883, guy, of, camerino, now, duke, of, spoleto, as, guy, iii, was, accused, of, treason, at, an, imperial, synod, held, at, nonantula, late, in, may, he, returned, to, spoleto, and, made, an, alliance, with, the, saracens, charles, sent, berengar, against, guy, iii, berengar, was, initially, successful, until, an, epidemic, of, disease, which, ravaged, all, of, italy, affecting, the, emperor, and, his, entourage, as, well, as, berengar, s, army, forced, him, to, retreat, in, 883, charles, signed, a, treaty, with, giovanni, ii, participazio, doge, of, venice, granting, that, any, assassin, of, a, doge, who, fled, to, the, territory, of, the, empire, would, be, fined, 100, lbs, of, gold, and, banished, in, the, early, 880s, the, remnants, of, the, great, heathen, army, defeated, by, alfred, the, great, at, the, battle, of, ethandun, in, 878, began, to, settle, in, the, low, countries, charles, s, brother, louis, the, younger, had, opposed, them, with, some, success, but, he, died, after, a, short, campaign, on, 20, january, 882, leaving, his, throne, to, charles, who, reunited, the, whole, east, frankish, kingdom, after, returning, from, italy, charles, held, an, assembly, at, worms, with, the, purpose, of, dealing, with, the, vikings, armies, from, the, whole, east, francia, were, assembled, in, the, summer, under, arnulf, duke, of, carinthia, and, henry, count, of, saxony, the, chief, viking, camp, was, then, besieged, at, asselt, charles, then, opened, negotiations, with, the, viking, chiefs, godfrid, and, sigfred, godfrid, accepted, christianity, and, became, charles, s, vassal, he, was, married, to, gisela, daughter, of, lothair, ii, of, lotharingia, sigfred, was, bribed, off, despite, the, insinuations, of, some, modern, historians, no, contemporary, account, criticised, charles, s, actions, during, this, campaign, in, 885, fearing, godfrid, and, his, brother, in, law, hugh, duke, of, alsace, charles, arranged, for, a, conference, at, spijk, near, lobith, where, the, viking, leader, fell, into, his, trap, godfrid, was, executed, and, hugh, was, blinded, and, sent, to, pr, m, from, 882, to, 884, the, wilhelminer, war, engulfed, the, march, of, pannonia, later, march, of, austria, arnulf, of, carinthia, charles, s, illegitimate, nephew, made, an, alliance, with, the, rebel, engelschalk, ii, against, aribo, of, austria, charles, s, appointed, margrave, of, the, region, svatopluk, i, ruler, of, great, moravia, agreed, to, help, aribo, and, in, 884, at, kaumberg, took, an, oath, of, fidelity, to, charles, though, the, emperor, lost, his, vassals, of, the, wilhelminer, family, and, his, relationship, with, his, nephew, was, broken, he, gained, powerful, new, allies, in, the, moravian, dux, and, other, slavic, duces, of, the, region, when, carloman, ii, of, west, francia, died, on, 12, december, 884, the, nobles, of, the, kingdom, invited, charles, to, assume, the, kingship, charles, gladly, accepted, it, being, the, third, kingdom, to, fall, into, his, lap, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, charles, succeeded, to, all, of, the, kingdom, of, carloman, except, brittany, but, this, does, not, seem, to, have, been, true, it, is, likely, that, charles, was, crowned, by, geilo, bishop, of, langres, as, rex, in, gallia, on, 20, may, 885, at, grand, in, the, vosges, in, southern, lorraine, although, geilo, even, developed, a, special, west, frankish, seal, for, him, charles, s, government, in, the, west, was, always, very, distant, and, he, left, most, day, to, day, business, to, the, higher, nobility, though, west, francia, the, future, france, was, far, less, menaced, by, the, vikings, than, the, low, countries, it, was, heavily, hit, nonetheless, in, 885, a, huge, fleet, led, by, sigfred, sailed, up, the, seine, for, the, first, time, in, years, and, besieged, paris, sigfred, demanded, a, bribe, again, but, this, time, charles, refused, he, was, in, italy, at, the, time, and, odo, count, of, paris, sneaked, some, men, through, enemy, lines, to, seek, his, aid, charles, sent, henry, of, saxony, to, paris, in, 886, as, disease, began, to, spread, through, paris, odo, himself, went, to, charles, to, seek, support, charles, brought, a, large, army, and, encircled, the, army, of, rollo, and, set, up, a, camp, at, montmartre, however, charles, had, no, intention, of, fighting, he, sent, the, attackers, up, the, seine, to, ravage, burgundy, which, was, in, revolt, when, the, vikings, withdrew, from, france, next, spring, he, gave, them, 700, pounds, of, promised, silver, charles, s, prestige, in, france, was, greatly, diminished, charles, issued, a, number, of, charters, for, west, frankish, recipients, during, his, stay, in, paris, during, and, after, the, siege, he, recognised, rights, and, privileges, granted, by, his, predecessors, to, recipients, in, the, spanish, march, and, provence, but, especially, in, neustria, where, he, had, contact, with, nantes, at, a, time, when, the, breton, duke, alan, i, was, known, to, be, powerful, in, the, county, of, nantes, it, is, probable, that, charles, granted, alan, the, right, to, be, titled, rex, as, emperor, he, would, have, had, that, prerogative, and, alan, s, use, of, the, title, appears, legitimate, a, charter, dated, to, between, 897, and, 900, makes, reference, to, the, soul, of, karolus, on, whose, behalf, alan, had, ordered, prayers, to, be, said, in, the, monastery, of, redon, this, was, probably, charles, the, fat, charles, childless, by, his, marriage, to, richgard, tried, to, have, bernard, his, illegitimate, son, by, an, unknown, concubine, recognised, as, his, heir, in, 885, but, this, met, with, opposition, from, several, bishops, he, had, the, support, of, pope, hadrian, iii, whom, he, invited, to, an, assembly, in, worms, in, october, 885, but, the, pope, died, on, the, way, there, just, after, crossing, the, river, po, hadrian, was, going, to, remove, the, obstructing, bishops, for, charles, as, he, doubted, he, could, do, this, himself, and, legitimise, bernard, based, on, the, unfavorable, attitude, shown, by, the, chronicler, responsible, for, the, mainz, continuation, of, the, annales, fuldenses, the, chief, of, charles, s, opponents, in, this, matter, was, most, likely, liutbert, archbishop, of, mainz, because, charles, had, called, together, the, bishops, and, counts, of, gaul, as, well, as, the, pope, to, meet, him, at, worms, it, is, likely, that, he, had, plans, to, make, bernard, king, of, lotharingia, notker, the, stammerer, who, considered, bernard, as, a, possible, heir, wrote, in, his, deeds, of, charlemagne, i, will, not, tell, you, of, this, until, i, see, your, little, son, bernard, with, a, sword, girt, to, his, thigh, after, the, failure, of, this, first, attempt, charles, set, about, to, try, again, he, had, the, term, proles, offspring, inserted, into, his, charters, it, had, not, been, in, previous, years, in, a, likely, attempt, to, legitimise, bernard, in, early, 886, charles, met, the, new, pope, stephen, v, and, probably, negotiated, for, the, recognition, of, his, illegitimate, son, as, heir, an, assembly, was, planned, for, april, and, may, of, the, following, year, at, waiblingen, pope, stephen, cancelled, his, planned, attendance, on, 30, april, 887, nevertheless, at, waiblingen, berengar, who, after, a, brief, feud, with, liutward, had, lost, the, favour, of, the, emperor, came, in, early, may, 887, made, peace, with, the, emperor, and, compensated, for, his, actions, of, the, previous, year, by, dispensing, great, gifts, charles, eventually, abandoned, his, plans, for, bernard, and, instead, adopted, louis, of, provence, as, his, son, at, an, assembly, at, kirchen, in, may, it, is, possible, however, that, the, agreement, with, louis, was, only, designed, to, engender, support, for, bernard, s, sub, kingship, in, lotharingia, in, june, or, july, berengar, arrived, in, kirchen, probably, pining, to, be, declared, charles, s, heir, he, may, in, fact, have, been, so, named, in, italy, where, he, was, acclaimed, or, made, himself, king, immediately, after, charles, s, deposition, odo, count, of, paris, may, have, had, a, similar, purpose, in, visiting, charles, at, kirchen, on, the, other, hand, the, presence, of, these, magnates, at, these, two, great, assemblies, may, merely, have, been, necessary, to, confirm, charles, s, illegitimate, son, as, his, heir, waiblingen, a, plan, which, failed, when, the, pope, refused, to, attend, and, then, to, confirm, louis, instead, kirchen, with, charles, increasingly, seen, as, spineless, and, incompetent, matters, came, to, a, head, in, late, 887, in, the, summer, of, that, year, having, given, up, on, plans, for, his, son, s, succession, charles, received, odo, and, berengar, margrave, of, friuli, a, relative, of, his, at, his, court, he, may, have, accepted, neither, one, or, both, of, these, as, his, heir, in, their, respective, kingdoms, his, inner, circle, then, began, to, fall, apart, first, he, accused, his, wife, richgard, of, having, an, affair, with, his, chief, minister, and, archchancellor, liutward, bishop, of, vercelli, she, proved, her, innocence, in, an, ordeal, of, fire, and, left, him, for, the, monastic, life, he, then, turned, against, liutward, who, was, hated, by, all, and, removed, him, from, office, appointing, liutbert, archbishop, of, mainz, in, his, place, in, that, year, his, first, cousin, once, removed, ermengard, of, provence, daughter, of, the, emperor, louis, ii, and, wife, of, boso, of, provence, brought, her, son, louis, the, blind, to, him, for, protection, charles, confirmed, louis, in, provence, he, may, even, have, adopted, him, and, allowed, them, to, live, at, his, court, he, probably, intended, to, make, louis, heir, to, the, whole, realm, and, the, imperium, on, november, he, called, an, assembly, to, frankfurt, while, there, he, received, news, that, an, ambitious, nephew, arnulf, of, carinthia, had, fomented, a, general, rebellion, and, was, marching, into, germany, with, an, army, of, bavarians, and, slavs, the, next, week, saw, the, collapse, of, all, his, support, in, east, francia, the, last, to, abandon, him, were, his, loyal, alemanni, though, the, men, of, lotharingia, never, seem, to, have, formally, accepted, his, deposition, by, 17, november, charles, was, out, of, power, though, the, exact, course, of, events, is, unknown, aside, from, rebuking, his, faithlessness, he, did, little, to, prevent, arnulf, s, move, he, had, recently, been, ill, again, but, assured, that, bernard, was, entrusted, to, his, care, and, possibly, louis, too, he, asked, for, a, few, estates, in, swabia, on, which, to, live, out, his, days, and, thus, received, naudingen, donaueschingen, there, he, died, six, weeks, later, on, 13, january, 888, the, empire, fell, apart, never, to, be, restored, according, to, regino, of, pr, m, each, part, of, the, realm, elected, a, kinglet, from, its, own, bowels, the, bowels, being, the, regions, inside, the, realm, it, is, probable, that, arnulf, desired, the, whole, empire, but, the, only, part, he, received, other, than, east, francia, was, lotharingia, the, french, elected, odo, although, he, was, opposed, at, first, by, guy, iii, of, spoleto, who, also, opposed, arnulf, in, lotharingia, guy, sought, the, kingship, in, italy, after, his, failures, in, francia, despite, berengar, having, already, been, crowned, louis, was, crowned, in, provence, as, charles, had, intended, and, he, sought, the, support, of, arnulf, and, gained, it, probably, through, supplication, to, him, odo, would, eventually, submit, to, arnulf, s, supremacy, as, well, in, upper, burgundy, one, rudolph, a, dux, of, the, region, was, elected, as, king, in, a, distinctly, non, carolingian, creation, probably, the, result, of, his, failure, to, succeed, in, the, whole, of, lotharingia, in, aquitaine, ranulf, ii, declared, himself, king, and, took, the, guardianship, of, the, young, charles, the, simple, the, carolingian, heir, to, the, west, refusing, to, recognise, odo, s, election, it, is, unknown, if, these, elections, were, a, response, to, charles, s, east, frankish, deposition, or, to, his, death, only, those, of, arnulf, and, berengar, can, be, certainly, placed, before, his, death, only, the, magnates, of, the, east, ever, formally, deposed, him, he, was, buried, with, honour, in, reichenau, after, his, death, and, the, annales, fuldenses, heap, praises, on, his, piety, and, godliness, indeed, contemporary, opinion, of, charles, is, consistently, kinder, than, later, historiography, though, it, is, a, modern, suggestion, that, his, lack, of, apparent, successes, is, the, excusable, result, of, near, constant, illness, and, infirmity, charles, was, the, subject, of, a, hortative, piece, of, latin, prose, the, visio, karoli, grossi, designed, to, champion, the, cause, of, louis, the, blind, and, warn, the, carolingians, that, their, continued, rule, was, not, certain, if, they, did, not, have, divine, i, e, ecclesiastical, favour
