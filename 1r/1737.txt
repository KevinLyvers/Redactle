marie, tharp, july, 30, 1920, august, 23, 2006, was, an, american, geologist, and, oceanographic, cartographer, in, the, 1950s, she, collaborated, with, geologist, bruce, heezen, to, produce, the, first, scientific, map, of, the, atlantic, ocean, floor, her, cartography, revealed, a, more, detailed, topography, and, multi, dimensional, geographical, landscape, of, the, ocean, bottom, tharp, s, discovery, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, caused, a, paradigm, shift, in, earth, science, that, led, to, the, acceptance, of, the, theories, of, plate, tectonics, and, continental, drift, marie, tharp, was, born, on, july, 30, 1920, in, ypsilanti, michigan, the, only, child, of, bertha, louise, tharp, a, german, and, latin, teacher, and, william, edgar, tharp, a, soil, surveyor, for, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, she, often, accompanied, her, father, on, his, fieldwork, which, gave, her, an, early, introduction, to, mapmaking, despite, this, she, had, no, interest, in, pursuing, a, career, in, fieldwork, as, during, that, time, this, was, understood, to, be, men, s, work, due, to, the, nature, of, william, tharp, s, work, the, family, constantly, moved, until, he, retired, in, 1931, at, that, point, marie, had, attended, over, 17, public, schools, in, alabama, iowa, michigan, and, indiana, which, made, it, difficult, for, her, to, establish, friendships, her, mother, who, died, when, marie, was, 15, was, her, closest, female, acquaintance, a, full, school, year, in, florence, alabama, was, particularly, influential, for, her, she, attended, a, class, called, current, science, where, she, learned, about, contemporary, scientists, and, their, research, projects, in, addition, she, undertook, school, field, trips, on, weekends, to, study, trees, and, rocks, after, her, father, s, retirement, marie, tharp, moved, to, a, farm, in, bellefontaine, ohio, where, she, graduated, from, the, local, high, school, she, spent, gap, years, between, high, school, and, college, working, on, her, family, s, farm, she, entered, the, ohio, university, in, 1939, where, she, changed, her, major, every, semester, tharp, graduated, from, ohio, university, in, 1943, with, bachelor, s, degrees, in, english, and, music, and, four, minors, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, many, young, men, left, schools, and, universities, to, join, the, armed, forces, during, world, war, ii, more, women, were, recruited, into, professions, like, petroleum, geology, normally, restricted, to, men, with, classrooms, empty, of, men, during, the, war, years, michigan, which, had, never, allowed, women, into, its, geology, program, was, trying, to, fill, seats, though, less, than, 4, of, all, earth, sciences, doctorates, at, the, time, were, obtained, by, women, having, taken, a, geology, class, at, ohio, tharp, attended, the, university, of, michigan, at, ann, arbor, s, petroleum, geology, program, where, she, completed, a, master, s, degree, in, 1944, after, graduating, tharp, began, work, as, a, junior, geologist, at, the, stanolind, oil, company, in, tulsa, oklahoma, but, discovered, that, the, company, did, not, permit, women, to, do, nor, attend, fieldwork, the, company, only, permitted, tharp, to, coordinate, maps, and, data, for, male, colleagues, trips, while, still, working, as, a, geologist, for, the, stanolind, oil, company, tharp, enrolled, in, the, faculty, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, tulsa, obtaining, her, second, bsc, by, 1948, tharp, had, spent, four, years, in, tulsa, and, was, looking, for, her, next, career, step, she, moved, to, new, york, city, and, initially, sought, work, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, still, after, learning, how, time, consuming, paleontological, research, was, she, looked, for, positions, at, columbia, university, she, eventually, found, drafting, work, with, maurice, ewing, the, founder, of, the, lamont, geological, observatory, now, the, lamont, doherty, earth, observatory, curiously, when, interviewed, for, the, job, tharp, did, not, mention, she, had, a, master, s, degree, in, geology, tharp, was, one, of, the, first, women, to, work, at, the, lamont, geological, observatory, while, there, she, met, bruce, heezen, and, in, early, work, together, they, used, photographic, data, to, locate, downed, military, aircraft, from, world, war, ii, eventually, she, worked, for, heezen, exclusively, plotting, the, ocean, floor, in, 1964, due, to, a, professional, disagreement, between, ewing, and, heezen, ewing, cut, off, heezen, s, access, to, lamont, data, and, then, fired, tharp, she, continued, to, work, on, mapping, projects, from, her, home, being, paid, by, heezen, through, navy, contracts, for, the, first, 18, years, of, their, collaboration, heezen, collected, bathymetric, data, aboard, the, research, ship, vema, while, tharp, drew, maps, from, that, data, since, women, were, barred, from, working, on, ships, at, the, time, she, was, later, able, to, join, a, 1968, data, collection, expedition, on, the, usns, kane, she, independently, used, data, collected, from, the, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, s, research, ship, atlantis, and, seismographic, data, from, undersea, earthquakes, her, work, with, heezen, represented, the, first, systematic, attempt, to, map, the, entire, ocean, floor, as, early, as, the, mid, 19th, century, a, submarine, mountain, range, in, the, atlantic, had, been, roughly, outlined, by, john, murray, and, johan, hjort, marie, tharp, also, discovered, the, rift, valley, on, her, more, precise, graphical, representations, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, which, were, based, on, new, measurement, data, obtained, with, the, echo, sounder, it, took, her, a, year, to, convince, bruce, heezen, of, this, later, she, also, mapped, the, other, mid, ocean, ridges, before, the, early, 1950s, scientists, knew, very, little, about, the, ocean, floor, structure, though, studying, geology, on, land, was, cheaper, and, easier, the, overall, structure, of, the, earth, could, not, be, understood, without, knowledge, of, the, structure, and, evolution, of, the, seafloor, in, 1952, tharp, painstakingly, aligned, sounding, profiles, from, atlantis, acquired, during, 1946, 1952, and, one, profile, from, the, naval, ship, stewart, acquired, in, 1921, she, created, approximately, six, profiles, stretching, west, to, east, across, the, north, atlantic, from, these, profiles, she, examined, the, bathymetry, of, the, northern, sections, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, tharp, identified, an, aligned, v, shaped, structure, running, continuously, through, the, axis, of, the, ridge, and, believed, that, it, might, be, a, rift, valley, formed, by, the, oceanic, surface, being, pulled, apart, heezen, was, initially, unconvinced, as, the, idea, would, have, supported, continental, drift, then, a, controversial, theory, many, scientists, including, heezen, believed, that, continental, drift, was, impossible, at, the, time, instead, for, a, time, he, favored, the, expanding, earth, hypothesis, now, infamously, dismissing, her, explanation, as, girl, talk, heezen, soon, hired, howard, foster, to, plot, the, location, of, earthquake, epicenters, in, the, oceans, for, a, project, relating, large, scale, turbidity, currents, to, undersea, earthquakes, the, creation, of, this, earthquake, epicenter, map, proved, to, be, a, useful, secondary, dataset, for, examining, the, bathymetry, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, when, foster, s, map, of, earthquake, epicenters, was, overlaid, with, tharp, s, profile, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, it, became, clear, that, the, location, of, these, earthquakes, aligned, with, tharp, s, rift, valley, after, putting, together, these, two, datasets, tharp, became, convinced, that, a, rift, valley, existed, within, the, crest, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, it, was, only, after, seeing, that, the, location, of, earthquake, epicenters, aligned, with, tharp, s, rift, valley, that, heezen, accepted, her, hypothesis, and, turned, to, the, alternative, theories, of, plate, tectonics, and, continental, drift, because, of, the, cold, war, the, u, s, government, forbade, topographic, seafloor, maps, to, be, published, for, fear, that, soviet, submarines, could, use, them, to, circumvent, that, restriction, tharp, and, heezen, decided, to, draw, their, maps, in, a, more, realistic, style, and, published, their, first, physiographic, map, of, the, north, atlantic, in, 1957, tharp, s, name, did, not, appear, on, any, of, the, major, papers, on, plate, tectonics, that, heezen, and, others, published, between, 1959, and, 1963, tharp, continued, working, with, graduate, student, assistants, to, further, map, the, extent, of, the, central, rift, valley, tharp, demonstrated, that, the, rift, valley, extended, along, with, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, into, the, south, atlantic, and, found, a, similar, valley, structure, in, the, indian, ocean, arabian, sea, red, sea, and, gulf, of, aden, suggesting, the, presence, of, a, global, oceanic, rift, zone, subsequently, in, collaboration, with, the, austrian, landscape, painter, heinrich, berann, tharp, and, heezen, realized, their, map, of, the, entire, ocean, floor, which, was, published, in, 1977, by, national, geographic, under, the, title, of, the, world, ocean, floor, although, tharp, was, later, recognized, and, credited, for, her, work, on, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, it, was, heezen, who, at, the, time, in, 1956, put, out, and, received, credit, for, the, discovery, that, was, made, after, heezen, s, death, tharp, continued, to, serve, on, the, faculty, of, columbia, university, until, 1983, after, which, she, operated, a, map, distribution, business, in, south, nyack, during, her, retirement, tharp, donated, her, map, collection, and, notes, to, the, map, and, geography, division, of, the, library, of, congress, in, 1995, in, 2001, tharp, was, awarded, the, first, annual, lamont, doherty, heritage, award, at, her, home, institution, for, her, life, s, work, as, a, pioneer, of, oceanography, tharp, died, of, cancer, in, nyack, new, york, on, august, 23, 2006, at, the, age, of, 86, in, 1948, she, married, david, flanagan, and, moved, with, him, to, new, york, they, divorced, in, 1952, like, many, scientists, marie, tharp, was, recognized, mainly, later, in, life, her, awards, include, tharp, was, recognized, in, 1997, by, the, library, of, congress, as, one, of, the, four, greatest, cartographers, of, the, 20th, century, the, position, of, marie, tharp, lamont, research, professor, was, created, in, her, honor, created, by, lamont, in, 2004, the, marie, tharp, fellowship, is, a, competitive, academic, visiting, fellowship, awarded, to, women, to, work, with, researchers, at, the, earth, institute, of, columbia, university, women, who, are, accepted, are, given, the, opportunity, to, work, with, faculty, research, staff, postdoctoral, researchers, and, graduate, students, and, in, the, duration, of, 3, months, they, are, awarded, up, to, 30, 000, as, financial, aid, google, earth, included, the, marie, tharp, historical, map, layer, in, 2009, allowing, people, to, view, tharp, s, ocean, map, using, the, google, earth, interface, she, is, the, subject, of, the, 2013, biography, by, hali, felt, entitled, soundings, the, story, of, the, remarkable, woman, who, mapped, the, ocean, floor, which, was, cited, by, the, new, york, times, for, its, standing, as, an, eloquent, testament, both, to, tharp, s, importance, and, to, felt, s, powers, of, imagination, she, was, animated, in, the, lost, worlds, of, planet, earth, the, ninth, episode, of, neil, degrasse, tyson, s, cosmos, a, spacetime, odyssey, and, voiced, by, actress, amanda, seyfried, the, episode, depicts, her, discovery, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, later, in, the, episode, degrasse, tyson, recognized, tharp, not, only, as, an, influential, scientist, who, happens, to, be, a, woman, but, also, as, one, who, should, be, recognized, as, a, scientist, who, overcame, sexism, to, contribute, to, her, field, her, life, story, is, told, in, three, children, s, books, solving, the, puzzle, under, the, sea, marie, tharp, maps, the, ocean, floor, by, robert, burleigh, and, illustrated, by, ra, l, col, n, ocean,
