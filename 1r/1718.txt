ecology, warming, wrote, the, first, textbook, 1895, on, plant, ecology, taught, the, first, university, course, in, ecology, and, gave, the, concept, its, meaning, and, content, scholar, r, j, goodland, wrote, in, 1975, if, one, individual, can, be, singled, out, to, be, honoured, as, the, founder, of, ecology, warming, should, gain, precedence, warming, wrote, a, number, of, textbooks, on, botany, plant, geography, and, ecology, which, were, translated, to, several, languages, and, were, immensely, influential, at, their, time, and, later, most, important, were, plantesamfund, and,

book, plantesamfund, was, based, on, warming, s, lectures, on, plant, geography, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, it, gives, an, introduction, to, all, major, biomes, of, the, world, warming, s, aim, and, his, major, lasting, impact, on, the, development, of, ecology, was, to, explain, how, nature, solved, similar, problems, drought, flooding, cold, salt, herbivory, etc, in, similar, way, despite, using, very, different, raw, material, species, of, different, origin, in, different, regions, of, the, world, this, was, a, remarkably, modern, view, completely, different, from, the, merely, descriptive, floristic, plant, geography, prevailing, during, his, time, the, subtitle, alludes, to, the, title, of, the, book, grundtr, k, af, den, almindelige, plantegeografi, published, in,

also, leaned, heavily, on, warming, s, research, schimper, 1898, quoted, extensively, from, more, than, 15, of, warming, s, works, and, even, reproduced, warming, s, figures, yet, nowhere, did, schimper, acknowledge, his, profound, debt, to, warming, neither, in, the, list, of, picture, credits, nor, in, the, acknowledgements, section, of, the, vorwort, nor, in, his, list, of, major,

a, skillful, and, dedicated, pedagogue, whose, presentation, of, the, subject, was, useful, far, beyond, his, lecture, theatre, in, copenhagen, he, wrote, a, number, of, botany, textbooks, for, the,

ecology, he, needed, students, to, get, out, in, nature, the, action, radius, from, copenhagen, offered, by, trips, by, foot, was, far, too, small, however, he, applied, to, the, government, and, obtained, a, grant, to, take, students, on, longer, excursions, every, year, from, 1893, every, third, year, these, went, to, western, jutland, once, to, bornholm, otherwise, to, zealand, his,

morphological, organogenetic, point, of, was, the, leading, principle, in, botanical, research, and, he, soon, became, one, of, the, most, prominent, workers, in, this, branch, of, botany, his, main, works, from, the, early, period, are, his, thesis, on, floral, development, in, euphorbia, and, on, seed, plant, ovules, warming, s, doctoral, thesis, in, danish, dealt, with, ontogeny, of, the, cyathia, of, euphorbia, euphorbiaceae, part, of, the, work, was, published, in, german, the, year, before, the, thesis, his, studies, of, pollen, and, anther, formation, i, angiosperms, and, on, the, inflorescence, of, asteraceae, were, published, in, von, hanstein, s, botanische, abhandlungen, his, studies, on, seed, plant, ovules, were, published, in, french, as, all, these, works, a, still, cited, in, scientific, papers, by, scholars, of, botany, every, now, and, then, through, the, 1870s, warming, became, much, influenced, by, darwinism, the, scope, of, his, research, changed, first, towards, understanding, ontogenesis, in, the, light, of, a, common, descent, as, seen, in, de, l, ovule, later, towards, plant, adaptation, to, environmental, conditions, again, his, unparalleled, ability, to, observe, plants, paired, with, his, tropical, experiencewas, decisive, to, the, route, he, chose, although, warming, did, not, coin, the, term, life, form, until, 1895, in, plantesamfund, ch, 2, he, commenced, work, on, plant, life, form, already, during, his, stockholm, years, in, the, paper, he, presented, a, classification, based, on, longevity, of, the, plant, power, of, vegetative, propagation, duration, of, tillers, hypogeous, or, epigeous, type, of, shoots, mode, of, wintering, and, degree, and, mode, of, branching, of, rhizomes, the, observation, were, made, while, raising, wild, plants, from, seed, under, garden, conditions, in, the, late, 1880s, after, warming, s, return, to, copenhagen, he, swopped, research, topic, with, his, student, christen, raunki, r, who, had, traveled, along, the, north, sea, coast, from, jutland, to, the, netherlands, and, published, on, the, phytogeography, of, coastal, vegetation, warming, now, worked, on, plant, adaptations, in, dunes, and, salt, marshes, while, raunki, r, studied, the, morphology, of, danish, plants, eventually, leading, him, to, his, plant, life, form, scheme, nevertheless, after, raunki, r, had, published, his, life, form, scheme, warming, return, to, this, topic, in, the, work, warming, s, new, scheme, was, less, simple, than, raunki, r, s, taking, other, environmental, factors, than, wintering, into, account, especially, water, drought, stress, warming, did, not, approve, of, what, he, saw, as, over, simplification, in, the, raunki, r, scheme, warmings, last, published, work, was, a, renewed, attempt, to, put, all, plant, including, bacteria, and, algae, life, forms, into, a, system, warmings, published, a, number, of, treatises, based, on, his, expedition, to, southwest, greenland, in, 1884, one, of, the, most, important, ones, is, his, observations, of, the, vegetation, of, greenland, and, the, history, of, the, flora, warming, s, collections, of, leaves, stems, and, flowers, made, during, the, brief, expedition, were, examined, in, detail, and, the, anatomy, of, a, number, of, species, described, in, a, series, of, papers, in, danish, later, warming, distributed, the, material, family, wise, now, ameliorated, with, collectections, made, later, expeditions, and, elsewhere, in, the, arctic, to, students, who, made, further, investigations, and, published, the, results, in, english, warming, e, ed, 1908, 1921, the, structure, and, biology, of, arctic, flowering, plants, meddelelser, om, gr, nland, vol, 36, 1, 481, and, 37, 1, 507, it, was, eugenius, warming, s, lehrbuch, der, kologischen, pflanzengeographie, that, must, be, considered, as, the, starting, point, of, self, conscious, ecology, this, book, was, the, first, to, use, physiological, relations, between, plants, and, their, environment, and, in, addition, biotic, interactions, to, explain, the, moulding, of, the, assemblages, that, plant, geographers, had, described, and, classified, and, it, would, set, up, a, research, agenda, for, decades, to, come, despite, the, language, barrier, warming, s, influence, on, the, development, of, ecology, is, remarkable, not, the, least, in, britain, and, the, usa, the, british, ecologist, arthur, tansley, was, extremely, influenced, by, reading, plantesamfund, or, rather, the, 1896, german, edition, reading, the, book, made, him, jump, from, anatomy, to, ecology, tansley, used, the, book, as, textbook, in, a, university, course, as, early, as, 1899, similarly, warming, s, book, was, decisive, in, forming, the, careers, of, north, american, naturalists, like, henry, chandler, cowles, cowles, now, classic, studies, of, lake, michigan, sand, dune, plant, communities, were, directly, inspired, by, warming, s, studies, of, danish, dunes, also, frederic, clements, was, much, inspired, by, warming, when, starting, to, working, with, succession, but, more, by, oscar, drude, in, formulating, his, concept, of, vegetational, climax, in, his, 1916, book, a, more, unexpected, avenue, of, influence, went, through, the, american, sociologist, robert, e, park, who, read, warming, s, oecology, of, plants, and, used, the, ideas, of, ecological, succession, as, inspiration, for, a, notion, of, succession, in, human, communities, a, human, ecology, warming, s, influence, on, later, scandinavian, ecology, was, immense, especially, significant, was, his, inspiration, to, christen, raunki, r, his, pupil, and, successor, on, the, chair, of, botany, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, in, addition, he, had, a, direct, influence, on, danish, research, scientific, and, other, for, a, couple, of, decades, after, his, appointment, to, the, professorship, in, copenhagen, he, gradually, took, over, japetus, steenstrups, power, base, most, notably, as, one, of, three, members, of, the, board, of, the, carlsberg, foundation, for, 32, years, thus, warming, had, the, upper, hand, in, who, should, be, granted, money, and, who, should, not, warming, was, a, firm, believer, in, adaptation, however, he, was, a, declared, lamarckist, in, his, popularizing, book, nedstamningsl, ren, the, theory, of, descendence, 1915, he, reviewed, the, direct, and, indirect, evidence, for, common, descent, of, living, organisms, and, for, darwinian, natural, selection, as, a, process, involved, in, speciation, his, keen, observations, of, how, differently, the, same, plant, is, grown, under, different, circumstances, now, known, as, phenotypic, plasticity, led, him, to, question, the, change, of, species, by, infinitesimally, small, steps, as, advocated, by, his, contemporary, darwinists, of, the, biometry, school, e, g, karl, pearson, warming, summarized, his, view, on, the, ways, in, which, new, species, could, may, arise, warming, was, raised, in, a, christian, protestant, home, and, he, continued, to, be, religious, throughout, his, life, he, accepted, the, evolution, by, descent, of, living, beings, but, believed, that, laws, governing, planets, orbits, and, other, laws, governing, organic, evolution, were, god, given, in, his, popular, book, nedstamningsl, ren, translated, title, evolution, by, descent, he, concludes, the, section, on, hypotheses, about, the, origin, of, life, writing, that, no, matter, what, hypothesis, is, considered, it, just, defers, the, grand, question, how, did, life, first, come, into, existence, in, the, beginning, as, if, we, human, beings, thereby, obtained, understanding, and, explanation, for, anything, at, all, or, circumvented, the, almighty, power, that, incomprehensibly, to, our, mind, must, have, created, matter, force, time, and, infinite, space, science, has, not, disproven, the, bible, that, says, in, the, beginning, god, created, warming, shared, this, view, with, many, prominent, contemporary, naturalists, e, g, alfred, russel, wallace, politically, warming, was, national, conservative, scandinavist, and, anti, prussian, warming, was, able, to, visit, his, birthplace, only, a, few, times, in, his, life, because, schleswig, was, conquered, by, prussia, and, austria, in, 1864, and, northern, schleswig, returned, to, denmark, in, 1920, warming, expressed, support, in, letters, for, france, in, the, 1870, franco, prussian, war, he, made, financial, contributions, to, a, secret, fund, that, should, support, danish, minded, schleswigian, farmers, in, buying, farms, and, prevent, germanization, of, northern, schleswig, in, a, letter, of, 1898, to, his, son, jens, he, regrets, that, the, h, jre, the, conservative, party, would, lose, an, upcoming, election, and, expresses, concern, that, anarchy, and, socialism, will, eventually, rule, the, orchid, genus, warmingia, rchb, f, and, dozens, of,
