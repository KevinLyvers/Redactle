geoffrey, of, monmouth, latin, galfridus, monemutensis, galfridus, arturus, welsh, gruffudd, ap, arthur, sieffre, o, fynwy, c, 1095, c, 1155, was, a, catholic, cleric, from, monmouth, wales, and, one, of, the, major, figures, in, the, development, of, british, historiography, and, the, popularity, of, tales, of, king, arthur, he, is, best, known, for, his, chronicle, the, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, latin, de, gestis, britonum, or, historia, regum, britanniae, which, was, widely, popular, in, its, day, being, translated, into, other, languages, from, its, original, latin, it, was, given, historical, credence, well, into, the, 16th, century, but, is, now, considered, historically, unreliable, geoffrey, was, born, between, about, 1090, and, 1100, in, wales, or, the, welsh, marches, he, had, reached, the, age, of, majority, by, 1129, when, he, is, recorded, as, witnessing, a, charter, geoffrey, refers, to, himself, in, his, historia, as, galfridus, monemutensis, geoffrey, of, monmouth, which, indicates, a, significant, connection, to, monmouth, wales, and, may, refer, to, his, birthplace, his, works, attest, to, some, acquaintance, with, the, place, names, of, the, region, geoffrey, was, known, to, his, contemporaries, as, galfridus, arturus, or, variants, thereof, the, arthur, in, these, versions, of, his, name, may, indicate, the, name, of, his, father, or, a, nickname, based, on, his, scholarly, interests, earlier, scholars, assumed, that, geoffrey, was, welsh, or, at, least, spoke, welsh, his, knowledge, of, this, language, appears, to, have, been, slight, however, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, was, of, either, welsh, or, cambro, norman, descent, he, may, have, come, from, the, same, french, speaking, elite, of, the, welsh, border, country, as, gerald, of, wales, walter, map, and, robert, earl, of, gloucester, to, whom, geoffrey, dedicated, versions, of, his, history, frank, merry, stenton, and, others, have, suggested, that, geoffrey, s, parents, may, have, been, among, the, many, bretons, who, took, part, in, william, the, conqueror, s, conquest, and, settled, in, the, southeast, of, wales, monmouth, had, been, in, the, hands, of, breton, lords, since, 1075, or, 1086, and, the, names, galfridus, and, arthur, were, more, common, among, the, bretons, than, the, welsh, he, may, have, served, for, a, while, in, the, benedictine, monmouth, priory, but, most, of, his, adult, life, appears, to, have, been, spent, outside, wales, between, 1129, and, 1151, his, name, appears, on, six, charters, in, the, oxford, area, sometimes, styled, magister, teacher, he, was, probably, a, secular, canon, of, st, george, s, college, all, the, charters, signed, by, geoffrey, are, also, signed, by, walter, archdeacon, of, oxford, a, canon, at, that, church, another, frequent, co, signatory, is, ralph, of, monmouth, a, canon, of, lincoln, archbishop, theobald, of, bec, consecrated, geoffrey, as, bishop, of, st, asaph, at, lambeth, on, 24, february, 1152, having, ordained, him, a, priest, at, westminster, 10, days, before, according, to, lewis, thorpe, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, ever, visited, his, see, and, indeed, the, wars, of, owain, gwynedd, make, this, most, unlikely, he, appears, to, have, died, between, 25, december, 1154, and, 24, december, 1155, according, to, welsh, chronicles, when, his, successor, took, office, geoffrey, s, structuring, and, shaping, of, the, merlin, and, arthur, myths, engendered, their, vast, popularity, which, continues, today, and, he, is, generally, viewed, by, scholars, as, the, major, establisher, of, the, arthurian, canon, the, history, s, effect, on, the, legend, of, king, arthur, was, so, vast, that, arthurian, works, have, been, categorised, as, pre, galfridian, and, post, galfridian, depending, on, whether, or, not, they, were, influenced, by, him, geoffrey, wrote, several, works, in, latin, the, language, of, learning, and, literature, in, europe, during, the, medieval, period, his, major, work, was, the, historia, regum, britanniae, the, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, the, work, best, known, to, modern, readers, it, relates, the, purported, history, of, britain, from, its, first, settlement, by, brutus, of, troy, a, descendant, of, trojan, hero, aeneas, to, the, death, of, cadwaladr, in, the, 7th, century, covering, julius, caesar, s, invasions, of, britain, kings, leir, and, cymbeline, and, one, of, the, earliest, developed, narratives, of, king, arthur, geoffrey, claims, in, his, dedication, that, the, book, is, a, translation, of, an, ancient, book, in, the, british, language, that, told, in, orderly, fashion, the, deeds, of, all, the, kings, of, britain, given, to, him, by, walter, archdeacon, of, oxford, but, modern, historians, have, dismissed, this, claim, it, is, likely, however, that, the, archdeacon, did, furnish, geoffrey, with, some, materials, in, the, welsh, language, which, helped, inspire, his, work, as, geoffrey, s, position, and, acquaintance, with, him, would, not, have, permitted, him, to, fabricate, such, a, claim, outright, much, of, it, is, based, on, the, historia, britonum, a, 9th, century, welsh, latin, historical, compilation, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, and, gildas, s, 6th, century, polemic, de, excidio, et, conquestu, britanniae, expanded, with, material, from, bardic, oral, tradition, and, genealogical, tracts, and, embellished, by, geoffrey, s, own, imagination, in, an, exchange, of, manuscript, material, for, their, own, histories, robert, of, torigny, gave, henry, of, huntingdon, a, copy, of, history, which, both, robert, and, henry, used, uncritically, as, authentic, history, and, subsequently, used, in, their, own, works, by, which, means, geoffrey, s, fictions, became, embedded, in, popular, history, the, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, is, now, usually, considered, a, literary, forgery, containing, little, reliable, history, this, has, since, led, many, modern, scholars, to, agree, with, william, of, newburgh, who, wrote, around, 1190, that, it, is, quite, clear, that, everything, this, man, wrote, about, arthur, and, his, successors, or, indeed, about, his, predecessors, from, vortigern, onwards, was, made, up, partly, by, himself, and, partly, by, others, other, contemporaries, were, similarly, unconvinced, by, geoffrey, s, history, for, example, giraldus, cambrensis, recounts, the, experience, of, a, man, possessed, by, demons, if, the, evil, spirits, oppressed, him, too, much, the, gospel, of, st, john, was, placed, on, his, bosom, when, like, birds, they, immediately, vanished, but, when, the, book, was, removed, and, the, history, of, the, britons, by, geoffrey, arthur, was, substituted, in, its, place, they, instantly, reappeared, in, greater, numbers, and, remained, a, longer, time, than, usual, on, his, body, and, on, the, book, geoffrey, s, major, work, was, nevertheless, widely, disseminated, throughout, medieval, western, europe, acton, griscom, listed, 186, extant, manuscripts, in, 1929, and, others, have, been, identified, since, it, enjoyed, a, significant, afterlife, in, a, variety, of, forms, including, translations, and, adaptations, such, as, wace, s, old, norman, french, roman, de, brut, layamon, s, middle, english, brut, and, several, anonymous, middle, welsh, versions, known, as, brut, y, brenhinedd, brut, of, the, kings, where, it, was, generally, accepted, as, a, true, account, in, 2017, miles, russell, published, the, initial, results, of, the, lost, voices, of, celtic, britain, project, established, at, bournemouth, university, the, main, conclusion, of, the, study, was, that, the, historia, regum, britanniae, appears, to, contain, significant, demonstrable, archaeological, fact, despite, being, compiled, many, centuries, after, the, period, that, it, describes, geoffrey, seems, to, have, brought, together, a, disparate, mass, of, source, material, including, folklore, chronicles, king, lists, dynastic, tables, oral, tales, and, bardic, praise, poems, some, of, which, was, irrevocably, garbled, or, corrupted, in, doing, so, geoffrey, exercised, considerable, editorial, control, massaging, the, information, and, smoothing, out, apparent, inconsistencies, in, order, to, create, a, single, grand, narrative, which, fed, into, the, preferred, narrative, of, the, norman, rulers, of, britain, much, of, the, information, that, he, used, can, be, shown, to, be, derived, from, two, discrete, sources, stretching, this, source, material, out, chopping, changing, and, re, editing, it, in, the, process, geoffrey, added, not, just, his, own, fictions, but, also, additional, information, culled, from, roman, and, early, medieval, histories, and, early, medieval, writers, such, as, gildas, and, bede, geoffrey, s, earliest, writing, was, probably, the, prophetiae, merlini, prophecies, of, merlin, which, he, wrote, before, 1135, and, which, appears, both, independently, and, incorporated, into, the, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, it, consists, of, a, series, of, obscure, prophetic, utterances, attributed, to, merlin, which, he, claimed, to, have, translated, from, an, unspecified, language, the, third, work, attributed, to, geoffrey, is, the, hexameter, poem, vita, merlini, life, of, merlin, based, more, closely, on, traditional, material, about, merlin, than, the, other, works, here, he, is, known, as, merlin, of, the, woods, merlinus, sylvestris, or, scottish, merlin, merlinus, caledonius, and, is, portrayed, as, an, old, man, living, as, a, crazed, and, grief, stricken, outcast, in, the, forest, the, story, is, set, long, after, the, timeframe, of, the, history, s, merlin, but, the, author, tries, to, synchronise, the, works, with, references, to, the, mad, prophet, s, previous, dealings, with, vortigern, and, arthur, the, vita, did, not, circulate, widely, and, the, attribution, to, geoffrey, appears, in, only, one, late, 13th, century, manuscript, but, it, contains, recognisably, galfridian, elements, in, its, construction, and, content, and, most, critics, recognise, it, as, his, notes, bibliography
