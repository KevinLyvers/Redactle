to, the, government, were, sim, ui, gyeom, and, kim, hyowon, sim, was, a, relative, of, the, queen, and, heavily, conservative, kim, was, the, leading, figure, of, the, new, generation, of, officials, and, called, for, liberal, reforms, the, scholars, who, supported, king, seonjo, began, to, split, into, two, factions, headed, by, sim, and, kim, members, of, the, two, factions, even, lived, in, the, same, neighborhood, sim, s, faction, lived, on, west, side, of, the, city, while, kim, s, followers, gathered, on, the, east, side, consequently, the, two, factions, began, to, be, called, the,

s, indecisiveness, helped, the, easterners, take, power, and, the, westerners, fell, out, of, favor, reforms, were, accelerated, during, the, first, period, of, influence, of, the, easterners, but, then, many, easterners, began, to, urge, others, to, slow, down, the, reforms, the, easterners, were, once, again, divided, into, the, northern, and, the, southern, faction, yu, seong, ryong, led, the, southern, faction, while, the, northerners, divided, even, further, after, arguments, over, many, issues, the, greater, northern, faction, came, to, become, extremely, liberal, in, the, scope, of, their, reform, goals, while, the, lesser, northern, faction, was, less, reformist, but, still, more, open, to, reform, than, the, southerners, the, political, divisions, caused, the, nation, to, be, weakened, since, the, size, of, the, military, was, also, one, of, the, issues, on, the, reform, agenda, yi, i, a, neutral, conservative, urged, the, king, to, increase, the, size, of, the, army, to, prepare, against, future, invasions, from, the, jurchens, and, japanese, however, both, factions, rejected, yi, s, suggestions, and, the, size, of, the, army, was, decreased, further, since, many, believed, the, peaceful, period, would, last, the, jurchens, and, japanese, used, this, opportunity, to, expand, their, influence, in, east, asia, resulting, in, the, seven, year, war, and, the, foundation, of, the, qing, dynasty, in, china, both, of, which, would, lead, to, devastation, on, the, korean, peninsula, king, seonjo, faced, many, difficulties, dealing, with, both, new, threats, sending, many, skilled, military, commanders, to, the, northern, front, while, contending, with, japanese, leaders, oda, nobunaga, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, in, the, south, however, after, toyotomi, hideyoshi, unified, japan, the, japanese, soon, proved, themselves, to, be, the, greater, threat, and, many, koreans, began, to, fear, that, their, country, would, be, taken, over, by, the, japanese, many, officials, concerned, with, the, defense, of, the, kingdom, urged, the, king, to, send, delegates, to, hideyoshi, their, major, purpose, being, to, find, out, whether, hideyoshi, was, preparing, for, invasion, or, not, however, the, two, government, factions, could, not, even, agree, on, this, issue, of, national, importance, so, a, compromise, was, made, and, one, delegate, from, each, faction, was, sent, to, hideyoshi, when, they, returned, to, korea, their, reports, only, caused, more, controversy, and, confusion, hwang, yun, gil, of, the, westerners, faction, reported, that, hideyoshi, was, raising, huge, numbers, of, troops, but, kim, seong, il, of, the, easterners, faction, told, the, king, that, he, thought, these, large, forces, were, not, for, the, war, against, korea, since, he, was, trying, to, complete, his, reforms, quickly, to, prevent, lawlessness, and, quash, the, bandits, now, roaming, the, countryside, since, the, easterners, had, the, bigger, voice, in, government, at, the, time, hwang, s, reports, were, ignored, and, seonjo, decided, not, to, prepare, for, war, even, though, the, attitude, of, hideyoshi, in, his, letter, to, seonjo, clearly, showed, his, interest, in, the, conquest, of, asia, the, factional, infighting, of, the, joseon, court, combined, with, the, 1589, rebellion, of, jeong, yeo, rip, that, led, to, the, purge, of, more, than, 1, 000, scholars, affiliated, with, the, eastern, faction, led, to, joseon, s, unpreparedness, against, the, imminent, japanese, invasions, in, 1591, after, the, delegates, had, returned, from, japan, toyotomi, hideyoshi, sent, his, own, delegates, to, visit, king, seonjo, and, asked, permission, to, pass, through, the, korean, peninsula, to, invade, china, in, effect, declaring, war, against, the, joseon, kingdom, the, king, was, surprised, after, refusing, the, japanese, request, he, sent, a, letter, to, beijing, to, alert, the, chinese, that, the, japanese, were, actually, preparing, for, full, scale, war, against, the, korean, chinese, alliance, he, also, ordered, the, construction, of, many, forts, in, the, coastal, regions, and, sent, generals, sin, rip, and, yi, il, to, the, southern, coast, to, prepare, for, war, while, the, koreans, were, busy, making, their, preparations, the, japanese, manufactured, muskets, for, many, of, their, soldiers,

defeated, then, seonjo, appointed, general, kim, myeong, won, as, commander, in, chief, and, field, marshal, and, ordered, him, to, defend, the, capita, and, moved, to, pyongyang, as, the, japanese, began, encroaching, upon, the, city, he, later, moved, even, further, north, to, the, border, city, of, uiju, just, before, the, fall, of, pyongyang, while, the, king, was, absent, from, the, capital, many, people, who, had, lost, hope, in, the, government, plundered, the, palace, and, burned, many, public, buildings, including, the, gyeongbokgung, during, seonjo, s, stay, at, uiju, he, wrote, the, joseon, government, s, first, public, document, written, solely, in, hangul, rather, than, hanja, historians, believe, that, the, king, deliberately, chose, hangul, to, ensure, commoners, could, understand, the, message, and, to, prevent, the, japanese, from, understanding, it, although, the, army, continued, to, lose, men, and, battles, the, navy, under, admiral, yi, sun, sin, defeated, the, japanese, fleet, several, times, and, did, much, damage, to, the, supply, ships, with, the, navy, blocking, supplies, ming, forces, arrived, at, the, request, of, seonjo, and, began, to, push, the, japanese, southward, eventually, retaking, pyongyang, konishi, yukinaga, successfully, blocked, a, chinese, advance, at, battle, of, byeokjegwan, and, again, tried, to, push, the, koreans, northward, but, the, crucial, blow, came, at, the, battle, of, hangju, where, general, gwon, yul, defeated, the, japanese, with, a, much, smaller, force, the, japanese, then, decided, to, enter, into, peace, negotiations, while, both, sides, continued, fighting, a, month, before, he, returned, to, hanyang, seonjo, wrote, an, edict, in, hangeul, where, anyone, that, either, captured, japanese, forces, in, battle, reported, on, invading, troop, movements, or, rescued, korean, prisoners, would, receive, the, title, of, government, official, regardless, of, class, during, these, negotiations, korean, forces, retook, hanseong, but, the, palaces, had, all, been, burnt, to, the, ground, so, seonjo, repaired, one, of, the, old, royal, family, s, houses, and, renamed, it, to, deoksugung, making, it, one, of, the, official, palaces, the, peace, negotiations, between, the, chinese, and, japanese, ended, unsuccessfully, due, to, disagreements, between, the, two, sides, and, misrepresentation, of, the, koreans, the, japanese, again, invaded, korea, in, 1597, but, this, time, all, three, nations, were, ready, for, war, and, the, japanese, were, not, able, to, advance, as, easily, as, in, 1592, the, japanese, tried, to, take, hanyang, from, both, land, and, sea, routes, at, first, the, plan, seemed, to, work, well, when, todo, takatora, defeated, admiral, won, gyun, at, the, battle, of, chilchonryang, but, it, was, eventually, thwarted, when, the, korean, navy, under, admiral, yi, sun, sin, defeated, the, japanese, fleet, under, todo, takatora, in, the, battle, of, myeongnyang, with, only, 13, ships, after, the, sudden, death, of, toyotomi, hideyoshi, in, 1598, the, japanese, completely, withdrew, from, korea, in, 1598, the, ensuing, battle, of, noryang, marked, the, end, of, the, war, with, the, last, japanese, units, under, konishi, yukinaga, leaving, korea, despite, all, the, efforts, put, in, by, seonjo, during, the, war, such, as, establishing, army, training, facilities,
