eastern, united, states, and, those, of, eastern, continental, asia, and, japan, and, the, line, of, demarcation, between, arctic, floras, of, america, and, greenland, as, probable, causes, they, considered, the, glacial, periods, and, an, earlier, land, connection, with, an, arctic, continent, a, difficult, question, was, why, in, the, great, mountain, chains, of, the, western, united, states, there, appeared, to, be, only, a, few, botanical, enclaves, of, plants, of, eastern, asiatic, afinities, among, plants, of, mexican, and, more, southern, types, hooker, visited, a, number, of,

the, theory, and, responded, with, notes, giving, darwin, calm, critical, feedback, their, correspondence, continued, throughout, the, development, of, darwin, s, theory, and, in, 1858, darwin, wrote, that, hooker, was, the, one, living, soul, from, whom, i, have, constantly, received, sympathy, freeman, 1978, wrote, hooker, was, charles, darwin, s, greatest, friend, and, confidant, certainly,

wallace, s, famous, letter, arrived, at, down, house, enclosing, his, paper, on, natural, selection, hooker, was, instrumental, in, creating, the, device, whereby, the, wallace, paper, was, accompanied, by, darwin, s, notes, and, his, letter, to, asa, gray, showing, his, prior, realisation, of, natural, selection, in, a, presentation, to, the, linnean, society, hooker, was, the, one, who, formally, presented, this, material, to, the, linnean, society, meeting, in, 1858, in, 1859, the, author, of, the, origin, of, species, recorded, his, indebtedness, to, hooker, s, wide,

in, this, essay, which, appeared, just, one, month, after, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, that, hooker, announced, his, support, for, the, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, thus, becoming, the, first, recognised, man, of, science, to, publicly, back, darwin, at, the, historic, debate, on, evolution, held, at, the, oxford, university, museum, on, 30, june, 1860, bishop, samuel, wilberforce, benjamin, brodie, and, robert, fitzroy, spoke, against, darwin, s, theory, and, hooker, and, thomas, henry, huxley, defended, it, according, to, hooker, s, own, account, it, was, he, and, not, huxley, who, delivered, the, most, effective, reply, to, wilberforce, s, arguments, hooker, acted, as, president, of, the, british, association, at, its, norwich, meeting, of, 1868, when, his, address, was, remarkable, for, its, championship, of, darwinian, theories, he, was, a, close, friend, of, thomas, henry, huxley, a, member, of, the, x, club, which, dominated, the, royal, society, in, the, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, and, the, first, of, the, three, x, clubbers, in, succession, to, become, president, of, the, royal, society, in, 1862,

intersperse, work, at, kew, with, foreign, exploration, and, collecting, his, journeys, to, palestine, morocco, and, the, united, states, all, produced, valuable, information, and, specimens, for, kew, he, started, the, series, flora, indica, in, 1855, together, with, thomas, thompson, their, botanical, observations, and, the, publication, of, the, rhododendrons, of, sikkim, himalaya, 1849, 51, formed, the, basis, of, elaborate, works, on, the, rhododendrons, of, the, sikkim, himalaya, and, on, the, flora, of, india, his, works, were, illustrated, with, lithographs, by, walter, hood, fitch, his, greatest, botanical, work, was, the, flora, of, british, india, published, in, seven, volumes, starting, in, 1872, on, the, publication, of, the, last, part, in, 1897, he, was, promoted, knight, grand, commander, of, the, order, of, the, star, of, india, being, made, a, knight, commander, of, that, order, in, 1877, ten, years, later, on, attaining, the, age, of, ninety, in, 1907, he, was, awarded, the, order, of, merit, he, was, the, author, of, numerous, scientific, papers, and, monographs, and, his, larger, books, included, in, addition, to, those, already, mentioned, a, standard, students, flora, of, the, british, isles, and, a, monumental, work, the, genera, plantarum, 1860, 83, based, on, the, collections, at, kew, in, which, he, had, the, assistance, of, george, bentham, his, collaboration, with, george, bentham, was, especially, important, bentham, an, amateur, botanist, who, worked, at, kew, for, many, years, was, perhaps, the, leading, botanical, systematist, of, the, 19th, century, the, handbook, of, the, british, flora, begun, by, bentham, and, completed, by, hooker, was, the, standard, text, for, a, hundred, years, it, was, always, known, as, bentham, hooker, in, 1904, at, the, age, of, 87, hooker, published, a, sketch, of, the, vegetation, of, the, indian, empire, he, continued, the, compilation, of, his, father, sir, william, jackson, hooker, s, project, icones, plantarum, illustrations, of, plants, producing, volumes, eleven, through, nineteen, with, most, of, the, illustrations, being, prepared, for, him, by, matilda, smith, the, herbarium, at, kew, was, founded, in, 1853, and, quickly, grew, in, size, and, importance, at, the, time, richard, owen, was, the, superintendent, of, the, natural, history, departments, of, the, british, museum, reporting, only, to, the, head, of, the, british, museum, hooker, appointed, in, 1855, as, assistant, director, of, kew, was, the, man, most, responsible, for, bringing, foreign, specimens, to, kew, there, is, no, doubt, that, rivalry, resulted, between, the, british, museum, where, there, was, the, very, important, herbarium, of, the, department, of, botany, and, kew, the, rivalry, at, times, became, extremely, personal, especially, between, joseph, hooker, and, owen, at, the, root, was, owen, s, feeling, that, kew, should, be, subordinate, to, the, british, museum, and, to, owen, and, should, not, be, allowed, to, develop, as, an, independent, scientific, institution, with, the, advantage, of, a, great, botanic, garden, the, relationship, between, the, two, men, continued, to, deteriorate, after, hooker, became, a, supporter, of, darwin, s, views, and, a, member, of, the, x, club, who, set, out, to, get, their, way, with, the, royal, society, in, 1868, hooker, had, proposed, that, the, whole, of, the, huge, herbarium, collection, of, joseph, banks, should, be, moved, from, the, british, museum, to, kew, a, reasonable, idea, but, a, threat, to, owen, s, plans, for, a, museum, in, south, kensington, to, house, the, natural, history, collections, hooker, cited, mismanagement, at, the, british, museum, as, a, justification, after, joseph, had, succeeded, his, father, as, director, in, 1865, the, independence, of, kew, was, seriously, threatened, by, the, machinations, of, a, member, of, parliament, acton, smee, ayrton, whose, appointment, as, first, commissioner, of, works, by, gladstone, in, 1869, was, greeted, in, the, times, with, the, prophecy, that, it, would, prove, another, instance, of, mr, ayrton, s, unfortunate, tendency, to, carry, out, what, he, thinks, right, in, as, unpleasant, a, manner, as, possible, this, was, relevant, because, kew, was, funded, by, the, board, of, works, and, the, director, of, kew, reported, to, the, first, commissioner, the, conflict, between, the, two, men, lasted, from, 1870, to, 1872, and, there, is, a, voluminous, correspondence, on, the, ayrton, episode, held, at, kew, ayrton, behaved, in, an, extraordinary, way, interfering, in, matters, and, approaching, hooker, s, colleagues, behind, his, back, apparently, with, the, aim, of, getting, hooker, to, resign, when, the, expenditure, on, kew, could, be, curtailed, and, diverted, ayrton, actually, took, staff, appointments, out, of, hooker, s, hands, he, seemed, not, to, value, the, scientific, work, and, to, believe, kew, should, be, just, an, amusement, park, hooker, wrote, my, life, has, become, utterly, detestable, and, i, do, long, to, throw, up, the, directorship, what, can, be, more, humiliating, than, two, years, of, wrangling, with, such, a, creature, finally, hooker, asked, to, be, put, in, communication, with, gladstone, s, private, secretary, algernon, west, a, statement, was, drawn, up, over, the, signatures, of, darwin, lyell, huxley, tyndall, bentham, and, others, it, was, laid, before, parliament, by, john, lubbock, and, additional, papers, laid, before, the, house, of, lords, lord, derby, called, for, all, the, correspondence, on, the, matter, the, treasury, supported, hooker, and, criticised, ayrton, s, behaviour, one, extraordinary, fact, emerged, there, had, been, an, official, report, on, kew, which, had, not, previously, been, seen, in, public, which, ayrton, had, caused, to, be, written, by, richard, owen, hooker, had, not, seen, the, report, and, so, had, not, been, given, right, of, reply, nonetheless, the, report, was, amongst, the, papers, laid, before, parliament, and, it, contained, an, attack, on, both, the, hookers, and, suggested, amongst, much, else, that, they, had, mismanaged, the, care, of, their, trees, and, that, their, systematic, approach, to, botany, was, nothing, more, than, attaching, barbarous, binomials, to, foreign, weeds, the, discovery, of, this, report, no, doubt, helped, to, sway, opinion, in, favour, of, hooker, and, kew, there, was, debate, in, the, press, as, well, as, parliament, hooker, replied, to, the, owen, report, in, a, point, by, point, factual, manner, and, his, reply, was, placed, with, the, other, papers, on, the, case, when, ayrton, was, questioned, about, it, in, the, debate, led, by, lubbock, he, replied, that, hooker, was, too, low, an, official, to, raise, questions, of, matter, with, a, minister, of, the, crown, the, outcome, was, not, a, vote, in, the, commons, but, a, kind, of, truce, until, in, august, 1874, gladstone, transferred, ayrton, from, the, board, of, works, to, the, office, of, judge, advocate, general, just, before, his, government, fell, ayrton, failed, to, get, re, elected, to, parliament, from, that, moment, to, this, the, value, of, the, botanic, gardens, has, never, been, seriously, questioned, in, the, midst, of, this, crisis, hooker, was, elected, as, president, of, the, royal, society, in, 1873, this, showed, publicly, the, high, regard, which, hooker, s, fellow, scientists, had, for, him, and, the, great, importance, they, attached, to, his, work, hooker, oak, in, chico, california, was, named, after, him, hooker, island, in, franz, josef, land, was, named, after, him, following, its, 1880, discovery
