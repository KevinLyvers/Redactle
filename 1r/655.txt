films, literature, and, music, among, other, things, this, allowed, tarkovsky, to, see, films, of, european, american, and, japanese, directors, an, experience, that, influenced, his, own, film, making, his, teacher, and, mentor, at, the, film, school, mikhail, romm, allowed, his, students, considerable, freedom, and, emphasized, the, independence, of, the, film, director, tarkovsky, was, according, to, fellow, student, shavkat, abdusalmov, fascinated, by, japanese, films, he, was, amazed, by, how, every, character, on, the, screen, is, exceptional, and, how, everyday, events, such, as, a, samurai, cutting, bread, with, his, sword, are, elevated, to, something, special, and, put, into, the, limelight, tarkovsky, has, also, expressed, interest, in, the, art, of, haiku, and, its, ability, to, create, images, in, such, a, way, that, they, mean, nothing, beyond, themselves, tarkovsky, was, also, a, deeply, religious, orthodox, christian, who, believed, great, art, should, have, a, higher, spiritual, purpose, he, was, a, perfectionist, not, given, to, humor, or, humility, his, signature, style, was, ponderous, and, literary, having, many, characters, that, pondered, over, religious, themes, and, issues, regarding, faith, tarkovsky, perceived, that, the, art, of, cinema, has, only, been, truly, mastered, by, very, few, filmmakers, stating, in, a, 1970, interview, with, naum, abramov, that, they, can, be, counted, on, the, fingers, of, one, hand, in, 1972, tarkovsky, told, film, historian, leonid, kozlov, his, ten, favorite, films, the, list, is, as, follows, diary, of, a, country, priest, and, mouchette, by, robert, bresson, winter, light, wild, strawberries, and, persona, by, ingmar, bergman, nazar, n, by, luis, bu, uel, city, lights, by, charlie, chaplin, ugetsu, by, kenji, mizoguchi, seven, samurai, by, akira, kurosawa, and, woman, in, the, dunes, by, hiroshi, teshigahara, he, also, liked, pier, paolo, pasolini, s, film, the, gospel, according, to, st, matthew, among, his, favorite, directors, were, bu, uel, mizoguchi, bergman, bresson, kurosawa, michelangelo, antonioni, jean, vigo, and, carl, theodor, dreyer, with, the, exception, of, city, lights, the, list, does, not, contain, any, films, of, the, early, silent, era, the, reason, is, that, tarkovsky, saw, film, as, an, art, as, only, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, with, the, early, film, making, forming, only, a, prelude, the, list, has, also, no, films, or, directors, from, tarkovsky, s, native, soviet, union, although, he, rated, soviet, directors, such, as, boris, barnet, sergei, parajanov, and, alexander, dovzhenko, highly, he, said, of, dovzhenko, s, earth, i, have, lived, a, lot, among, very, simple, farmers, and, met, extraordinary, people, they, spread, calmness, had, such, tact, they, conveyed, a, feeling, of, dignity, and, displayed, wisdom, that, i, have, seldom, come, across, on, such, a, scale, dovzhenko, had, obviously, understood, wherein, the, sense, of, life, resides, this, trespassing, of, the, border, between, nature, and, mankind, is, an, ideal, place, for, the, existence, of, man, dovzhenko, understood, this, he, was, also, not, a, fan, of, blockbusters, or, science, fiction, largely, dismissing, the, latter, for, its, comic, book, trappings, and, vulgar, commercialism, however, in, notable, exceptions, tarkovsky, praised, the, james, cameron, blockbuster, film, the, terminator, saying, that, its, vision, of, the, future, and, the, relation, between, man, and, its, destiny, is, pushing, the, frontier, of, cinema, as, an, art, he, was, critical, of, the, brutality, and, low, acting, skills, but, was, nevertheless, impressed, by, the, film, he, equally, liked, george, lucas, s, star, wars, according, to, his, son, andrei, a, tarkovsky, in, a, 1962, interview, tarkovsky, argued, all, art, of, course, is, intellectual, but, for, me, all, the, arts, and, cinema, even, more, so, must, above, all, be, emotional, and, act, upon, the, heart, his, films, are, characterized, by, metaphysical, themes, extremely, long, takes, and, images, often, considered, by, critics, to, be, of, exceptional, beauty, recurring, motifs, are, dreams, memory, childhood, running, water, accompanied, by, fire, rain, indoors, reflections, levitation, and, characters, re, appearing, in, the, foreground, of, long, panning, movements, of, the, camera, he, once, said, juxtaposing, a, person, with, an, environment, that, is, boundless, collating, him, with, a, countless, number, of, people, passing, by, close, to, him, and, far, away, relating, a, person, to, the, whole, world, that, is, the, meaning, of, cinema, tarkovsky, incorporated, levitation, scenes, into, several, of, his, films, most, notably, solaris, to, him, these, scenes, possess, great, power, and, are, used, for, their, photogenic, value, and, magical, inexplicability, water, clouds, and, reflections, were, used, by, him, for, their, surreal, beauty, and, photogenic, value, as, well, as, their, symbolism, such, as, waves, or, the, forms, of, brooks, or, running, water, bells, and, candles, are, also, frequent, symbols, these, are, symbols, of, film, sight, and, sound, and, tarkovsky, s, film, frequently, has, themes, of, self, reflection, tarkovsky, developed, a, theory, of, cinema, that, he, called, sculpting, in, time, by, this, he, meant, that, the, unique, characteristic, of, cinema, as, a, medium, was, to, take, our, experience, of, time, and, alter, it, unedited, movie, footage, transcribes, time, in, real, time, by, using, long, takes, and, few, cuts, in, his, films, he, aimed, to, give, the, viewers, a, sense, of, time, passing, time, lost, and, the, relationship, of, one, moment, in, time, to, another, up, to, and, including, his, film, mirror, tarkovsky, focused, his, cinematic, works, on, exploring, this, theory, after, mirror, he, announced, that, he, would, focus, his, work, on, exploring, the, dramatic, unities, proposed, by, aristotle, a, concentrated, action, happening, in, one, place, within, the, span, of, a, single, day, several, of, tarkovsky, s, films, have, color, or, black, and, white, sequences, this, first, occurs, in, the, otherwise, monochrome, andrei, rublev, which, features, a, color, epilogue, of, rublev, s, authentic, religious, icon, paintings, all, of, his, films, afterwards, contain, monochrome, and, in, stalker, s, case, sepia, sequences, while, otherwise, being, in, color, in, 1966, in, an, interview, conducted, shortly, after, finishing, andrei, rublev, tarkovsky, dismissed, color, film, as, a, commercial, gimmick, and, cast, doubt, on, the, idea, that, contemporary, films, meaningfully, use, color, he, claimed, that, in, everyday, life, one, does, not, consciously, notice, colors, most, of, the, time, and, that, color, should, therefore, be, used, in, film, mainly, to, emphasize, certain, moments, but, not, all, the, time, as, this, distracts, the, viewer, to, him, films, in, color, were, like, moving, paintings, or, photographs, which, are, too, beautiful, to, be, a, realistic, depiction, of, life, director, ingmar, bergman, commented, on, tarkovsky, my, discovery, of, tarkovsky, s, first, film, was, like, a, miracle, suddenly, i, found, myself, standing, at, the, door, of, a, room, the, keys, of, which, had, until, then, never, been, given, to, me, it, was, a, room, i, had, always, wanted, to, enter, and, where, he, was, moving, freely, and, fully, at, ease, i, felt, encountered, and, stimulated, someone, was, expressing, what, i, had, always, wanted, to, say, without, knowing, how, tarkovsky, is, for, me, the, greatest, the, one, who, invented, a, new, language, true, to, the, nature, of, film, as, it, captures, life, as, a, reflection, life, as, a, dream, contrarily, however, bergman, conceded, the, truth, in, the, claim, made, by, a, critic, who, wrote, that, with, autumn, sonata, bergman, does, bergman, adding,

the, 20th, century, are, 1, to, make, the, epic, that, is, to, tell, the, tales, of, the, tribes, of, the, world, 2, to, keep, it, personal, because, only, in, the, eccentricities, of, our, personal, lives, do, we, have, any, chances, at, the, truth, 3, to, do, the, dream, work, that, is, to, illuminate, the, borders, of, the, unconscious, the, only, filmmaker, i, know, that, does, all, these,

shocked, by, it, i, did, not, know, what, to, do, i, was, shocked, by, it, i, was, fascinated, because, suddenly, i, realized, that, film, could, have, so, many, more, layers, to, it, than, what, i, had, imagined, before, there, are, many, direct, references, and, hidden, tributes, to, tarkovsky, s, movies, in, i, arritu, s, 2015, oscar, winning, drama, the, revenant, danish, film, director,
