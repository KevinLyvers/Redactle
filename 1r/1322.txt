he, was, removed, at, the, behest, of, great, britain, and, france, sharing, the, ambitious, outlook, of, his, grandfather, muhammad, ali, pasha, he, greatly, modernized, egypt, and, sudan, during, his, reign, investing, heavily, in, industrial, and, economic, development, urbanization, and, the, expansion, of, the, country, s, boundaries, in, africa, his, philosophy, can, be, glimpsed, in, a, statement, that, he, made, in, 1879, my, country, is, no, longer, only, in, africa, we, are, now, part, of, europe, too, it, is, therefore, natural, for, us, to, abandon, our, former, ways, and, to, adopt, a, new, system, adapted, to, our, social, conditions, in, 1867, he, also, secured, ottoman, and, international, recognition, for, his, title, of, khedive, viceroy, in, preference, to, w, li, governor, which, was, previously, used, by, his, predecessors, in, the, eyalet, of, egypt, and, sudan, 1517, 1867, however, isma, il, s, policies, placed, the, khedivate, of, egypt, and, sudan, 1867, 1914, in, severe, debt, leading, to, the, sale, of, the, country, s, shares, in, the, suez, canal, company, to, the, british, government, and, his, ultimate, toppling, from, power, in, 1879, under, british, and, french, pressure, the, city, of, ismailia, is, named, in, his, honor, the, second, of, the, three, sons, of, ibrahim, pasha, and, the, grandson, of, muhammad, ali, isma, il, of,

the, western, powers, thus, isma, il, pasha, was, ruling, egypt, and, sudan, for, the, entire, period, when, his, cousin, abdulaziz, was, ruling, the, ottoman, empire, after, receiving, a, european, education, in, paris, where, he, attended, the, cole, d, tat, major, he, returned, home, and, on, the, death, of, his, elder, brother, became, heir, to, his, uncle, sa, id, the, w, li, and, khedive, of, egypt, and, sudan, sa, id, who, apparently, conceived, his, safety, to, lie, in, ridding, himself, as, much, as, possible, of, the, presence, of, his, nephew, employed, him, in, the, next, few, years, on, missions, abroad, notably, to, the, pope, the, emperor, napoleon, iii, and, the, sultan, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1861, he, was, dispatched, at, the, head, of, an, army, of, 18, 000,

and, the, other, great, powers, recognized, him, only, as, w, li, like, all, egyptian, and, sudanese, rulers, since, his, grandfather, muhammad, ali, pasha, he, claimed, the, higher, title, of, khedive, which, the, sublime, porte, had, consistently, refused, to, sanction, finally, in, 1867, isma, il, succeeded, in, persuading, the, ottoman, sultan, abd, laziz, to, grant, a, firman, finally, recognizing, him, as, khedive, in, exchange, for, an, increase, in, the, tribute, because, of, the, khedive, s, help, in, the, cretan, revolt, between, 1866, and, 1869, another, firman, changed, the, law, of, succession, to, direct, descent, from, father, to, son, rather, than, brother, to, brother, and, a, further, decree, in, 1873, confirmed, the, virtual, independence, of, the, khedivate, of, egypt, from, the, porte, isma, il, spent, heavily, some, went, to, bribes, to, constantinople, to, facilitate, his, reform, projects, much, of, the, money, went, for, the, construction, of, the, suez, canal, about, 46, million, went, to, construct, 8, 000, miles, 13, 000, km, of, irrigation, canals, to, help, modernize, agriculture, he, built, over, 900, miles, 1, 400, km, railroads, 5, 000, miles, 8, 000, km, of, telegraph, lines, 400, bridges, harbor, works, in, alexandria, and, 4, 500, schools, the, national, debt, rose, from, 3, million, to, about, 90, million, in, a, country, with, 5, million, population, and, an, annual, treasury, revenue, of, about, 8, million, isma, il, launched, vast, schemes, of, internal, reform, on, the, scale, of, his, grandfather, remodeling, the, customs, system, and, the, post, office, stimulating, commercial, progress, creating, a, sugar, industry, building, the, cotton, industry, building, palaces, entertaining, lavishly, and, maintaining, an, opera, and, a, theatre, over, one, hundred, thousand, europeans, came, to, work, in, cairo, where, he, facilitated, building, an, entire, new, quarter, of, the, city, on, its, western, edge, modeled, on, paris, alexandria, was, also, improved, he, launched, a, vast, railroad, building, project, that, saw, egypt, and, sudan, rise, from, having, virtually, none, to, the, most, railways, per,

trained, elite, a, national, library, was, founded, in, 1871, one, of, his, most, significant, achievements, was, to, establish, an, assembly, of, delegates, in, november, 1866, though, this, was, supposed, to, be, a, purely, advisory, body, its, members, eventually, came, to, have, an, important, influence, on, governmental, affairs, village, headmen, dominated, the, assembly, and, came, to, exert, increasing, political, and, economic, influence, over, the, countryside, and, the, central, government, this, was, shown, in, 1876, when, the, assembly, persuaded, isma, il, to, reinstate, the, law, enacted, by, him, in, 1871, to, raise, money, and, later, repealed, that, allowed, landownership, and, tax, privileges, to, persons, paying, six, years, land, tax, in, advance, isma, il, tried, to, reduce, slave, trading, and, with, the, advice, and, financial, backing, of, yacoub, cattaui, extended, egypt, s, rule, in, africa, in, 1874, he, annexed, darfur, but, was, prevented, from, expanding, into, ethiopia, after, his, army, was, repeatedly, defeated, by, emperor, yohannes, iv, first, at, gundet, on, 16, november, 1875, and, again, at, gura, in, march, of, the, following, year, isma, il, dreamt, of, expanding, his, realm, across, the, entire, nile, including, its, diverse, sources, and, over, the, whole, african, coast, of, the, red, sea, this, together, with, rumours, about, rich, raw, material, and, fertile, soil, led, isma, il, to, expansive, policies, directed, against, ethiopia, under, the, emperor, yohannes, iv, in, 1865, the, ottoman, sublime, porte, ceded, the, african, portion, of, the, habesh, eyalet, with, massawa, and, suakin, at, the, red, sea, as, the, main, cities, of, that, province, to, isma, il, this, province, which, neighboured, ethiopia, first, consisted, of, a, coastal, strip, only, but, expanded, subsequently, inland, into, territory, controlled, by, the, ethiopian, ruler, here, isma, il, occupied, regions, originally, claimed, by, the, ottomans, when, they, had, established, the, province, eyalet, of, habesh, in, the, 16th, century, new, economically, promising, projects, like, huge, cotton, plantations, in, the, barka, delta, were, started, in, 1872, bogos, with, the, city, of, keren, was, annexed, by, the, governor, of, the, new, province, of, eastern, sudan, and, the, red, sea, coast, werner, munzinger, pasha, in, october, 1875, isma, il, s, army, tried, to, occupy, the, adjacent, highlands, of, hamasien, which, were, then, tributary, to, the, ethiopian, emperor, and, suffered, defeat, at, the, battle, of, gundet, in, march, 1876, isma, il, s, army, tried, again, and, suffered, a, second, dramatic, defeat, by, yohannes, s, army, at, gura, isma, il, s, son, hassan, was, captured, by, the, ethiopians, and, only, released, after, a, large, ransom, this, was, followed, by, a, long, cold, war, only, finishing, in, 1884, with, the, anglo, egyptian, ethiopian, hewett, treaty, when, bogos, was, given, back, to, ethiopia, the, red, sea, province, created, by, ismail, and, his, governor, munzinger, pasha, was, taken, over, by, the, italians, shortly, thereafter, and, became, the, territorial, basis, for, the, colony, of, eritrea, proclaimed, in, 1890, the, jurisdiction, of, isma, il, pasha, from, the, 1870s, until, 1884, included, the, entire, northern, coast, of, somalia, up, to, the, eastern, coast, at, ras, hafun, in, contemporary, puntland, the, khedive, s, northern, somali, coast, territory, was, reached, as, far, inland, as, harar, although, it, was, subsequently, ceded, to, britain, in, 1884, due, to, internal, difficulties, of, egypt, isma, il, s, khedivate, is, closely, connected, to, the, building, of, the, suez, canal, he, agreed, to, and, oversaw, the, egyptian, portion, of, its, construction, on, his, accession, at, the, behest, of, yacoub, cattaui, his, minister, of, finance, and, close, advisor, he, refused, to, ratify, the, concessions, to, the, canal, company, made, by, sa, id, and, the, question, was, referred, in, 1864, to, the, arbitration, of, napoleon, iii, who, awarded, 3, 800, 000, to, the, company, as, compensation, for, the, losses, they, would, incur, by, the, changes, which, isma, il, insisted, upon, in, the, original, grant, isma, il, then, used, every, available, means, by, his, own, undoubted, powers, of, fascination, and, by, judicious, expenditure, to, bring, his, personality, before, the, foreign, sovereigns, and, public, and, he, had, much, success, in, 1867, he, visited, paris, during, the, exposition, universelle, 1867, with, sultan, abd, laziz, and, also, london, where, he, was, received, by, queen, victoria, and, welcomed, by, the, lord, mayor, while, in, britain, he, also, saw, a, british, royal, navy, fleet, review, with, the, sultan, in, 1869, he, again, paid, a, visit, to, britain, when, the, canal, finally, opened, isma, il, held, a, festival, of, unprecedented, scope, most, of, it, financed, by, the, cattaui, banking, house, from, whom, he, borrowed, 1, 000, 000, inviting, dignitaries, from, around, the, world, these, developments, especially, the, costly, war, with, ethiopia, left, egypt, in, deep, debt, to, the, european, powers, and, they, used, this, position, to, wring, concessions, out, of, isma, il, one, of, the, most, unpopular, among, egyptians, and, sudanese, was, the, new, system, of, mixed, courts, by, which, europeans, were, tried, by, judges, from, their, own, states, rather, than, by, egyptian, and, sudanese, courts, but, at, length, the, inevitable, financial, crisis, came, a, national, debt, of, over, 100, million, sterling, as, opposed, to, three, millions, when, he, acceded, to, the, throne, had, been, incurred, by, the, khedive, whose, fundamental, idea, of, liquidating, his, borrowings, was, to, borrow, at, increased, interest, the, bond, holders, became, restive, chief, among, them, the, house, of, cattaui, judgments, were, given, against, the, khedive, in, the, international, tribunals, when, he, could, raise, no, more, loans, he, sold, the, egyptian, and, sudanese, shares, in, the, suez, canal, company, in, 1875, with, the, assistance, of, yacoub, cattaui, to, the, british, government, for, 3, 976, 582, this, was, immediately, followed, by, the, beginning, of, direct, intervention, by, the, great, powers, in, egypt, and, sudan, in, december, 1875, stephen, cave, and, john, stokes, were, sent, out, by, the, british, government, to, inquire, into, the, finances, of, egypt, and, in, april, 1876, their, report, was, published, advising, that, in, view, of, the, waste, and, extravagance, it, was, necessary, for, foreign, powers, to, interfere, in, order, to, restore, credit, the, result, was, the, establishment, of, the, caisse, de, la, dette, a, subsequent, investigation, in, october, by, george, goschen, and, joubert, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, joint, anglo, french, control, over, most, of, the, egyptian, government, s, finances, a, further, commission, of, inquiry, by, major, evelyn, baring, afterwards, 1st, earl, of, cromer, and, others, in, 1878, culminated, in, isma, il, handing, over, much, of, his, personal, estates, to, the, nation, and, accepting, the, position, of, a, constitutional, sovereign, with, nubar, as, premier, charles, rivers, wilson, as, finance, minister, and, de, bligni, res, as, minister, of, public, works, as, the, historian, eugene, rogan, has, observed, the, irony, of, the, situation, was, that, egypt, had, embarked, on, its, development, schemes, to, secure, independence, from, ottoman, and, european, domination, yet, with, each, new, concession, the, government, of, egypt, made, itself, more, vulnerable, to, european, encroachment, this, control, of, the, country, by, europeans, was, unacceptable, to, many, egyptians, who, united, behind, a, disaffected, colonel, ahmed, urabi, the, urabi, revolt, consumed, egypt, hoping, the, revolt, could, relieve, him, of, european, control, isma, il, did, little, to, oppose, urabi, and, gave, into, his, demands, to, dissolve, the, government, britain, and, france, took, the, matter, seriously, and, insisted, in, may, 1879, on, the, reinstatement, of, the, british, and, french, ministers, with, the, country, largely, in, the, hands, of, urabi, isma, il, could, not, agree, and, had, little, interest, in, doing, so, as, a, result, the, british, and, french, governments, pressured, the, ottoman, sultan, abd, lhamid, ii, to, depose, isma, il, pasha, and, this, was, done, on, 26, june, 1879, the, more, pliable, tewfik, pasha, ismail, s, eldest, son, was, made, his, successor, isma, il, pasha, left, egypt, and, initially, went, into, exile, to, resina, today, ercolano, near, naples, until, 1885, when, he, was, eventually, permitted, by, sultan, abd, lhamid, ii, to, retire, to, his, palace, in, emirgan, on, the, bosporus, in, constantinople, there, he, remained, more, or, less, a, state, prisoner, until, his, death, according, to, time, magazine, he, died, while, trying, to, guzzle, two, bottles, of, champagne, in, one, draft, he, was, later, buried, in, cairo, although, he, ruled, egypt, where, the, common, language, was, arabic, isma, il, spoke, turkish, best, and, could, not, speak, arabic, nevertheless, under, his, reign, the, use, of, arabic, in, government, gradually, increased, at, the, expense, of, turkish, which, had, been, the, language, of, the, ruling, elite, in, the, nile, delta, during, the, hundreds, of, years, of, ottoman, rule, in, the, following, decades, arabic, would, further, expand, and, eventually, replace, turkish, in, the, army, and, in, administration, leaving, turkish, to, be, used, only, in, correspondence, with, the, ottoman, sultan, in, constantinople
