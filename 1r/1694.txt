be, the, greatest, proponent, of, settlement, in, new, south, wales, a, genus, of, the, proteaceae, was, named, in, his, honour, as, banksia, in, 1779, banks, giving, evidence, before, a, committee, of, the, house, of, commons, had, stated, that, in, his, opinion, the, place, most, eligible, for, the, reception, of, convicts, was, botany, bay, on, the, coast, of, new, holland, on, the, general, grounds, that, it, was, not, to, be, doubted, that, a, tract, of, land, such, as, new, holland, which, was, larger, than, the, whole, of, europe, would, furnish, matter, of, advantageous, return, although, banks, remained, uninvolved, in, these, colonies, in, a, hands, on, manner, he, was, nonetheless, the, general, adviser, to, the, government, on, all, australian, matters, for, twenty, years, he, arranged, that, a, large, number, of, useful, trees, and, plants, should, be, sent, out, in, the, supply, ship, hms, guardian, which, was, unfortunately, wrecked, as, well, as, other, ships, many, of, these, were, supplied, by, hugh, ronalds, from, his, nursery, in, brentford, every, vessel, that, came, from, new, south, wales, brought, to, banks, plants, or, animals, or,

banks, had, seemingly, listed, as, among, his, desiderata, he, was, continually, called, on, for, help, in, developing, the, agriculture, and, trade, of, the, colony, and, his, influence, was, used, in, connection, with, the, sending, out, of, early, free, settlers, one, of, whom, a, young, gardener, george, suttor, later, wrote, a, memoir, of, banks, the, three, earliest, governors, of, the,

matthew, flinders, george, bass, and, lieutenant, james, grant, and, among, his, paid, helpers, were, george, caley, robert, brown, and, allan, cunningham, however, banks, backed, william, bligh, to, be, installed, as, the, new, governor, of, new, south, wales, and, to, crack, down, on, the, new, south, wales, corps, or, rum, corps, which, made, a, fortune, on, the, trading, of, rum, this, brought, him, in, direct, confrontation, with, post, rum, rebellion, de, facto, leaders, such, as, john, macarthur, and, george, johnston, this, backing, led, to, the, rum, rebellion, in, sydney, whereby, the, governor, was, overthrown, by, the, two, men, this, became, an, embarrassment, for, sir, joseph, banks, also, because, years, earlier, he, campaigned, that, john, macarthur, not, be, granted, 4, 000, hectares, 10, 000, acres, of, land, near, sydney, in, the, cow, pastures, which, was, later, granted, by, lord, camden, the, next, governor, lachlan, macquarie, was, asked, to, arrest, macarthur, and, johnston, only, to, realise, that, they, had, left, sydney, for, london, to, defend, themselves, he, was, humiliated, that, macarthur, and, johnston, were, acquitted, from, all, charges, in, london, and, both, later, returned, to, sydney, banks, met, the, young, alexander, von, humboldt, in, 1790, when, banks, was, already, the, president, of, the, royal, society,
