translator, and, historian, he, is, commonly, known, as, saint, jerome, he, is, best, known, for, his, translation, of, the, bible, into, latin, the, translation, that, became, known, as, the, vulgate, and, his, commentaries, on, the, whole, bible, jerome, attempted, to, create, a, translation, of, the, old, testament, based, on, a, hebrew, version, rather, than, the, septuagint, as, prior, latin, bible, translations, used, his, list, of, writings, is, extensive, in, addition, to, his, biblical, works, he, wrote, polemical, and, historical, essays, always, from, a, theologian, s, perspective, jerome, was, known, for, his, teachings, on, christian, moral, life, especially, those, in, cosmopolitan, centers, such, as, rome, he, often, focused, on, women, s, lives, and, identified, how, a, woman, devoted, to, jesus, should, live, her, life, this, focus, stemmed, from, his, close, patron, relationships, with, several, prominent, female, ascetics, who, were, members, of, affluent, senatorial, families, in, addition, his, works, are, a, crucial, source, of, information, on, the, pronunciation, of, the, hebrew, language, in, byzantine, palestine, due, to, his, work, jerome, is, recognized, as, a, saint, and, doctor, of, the, church, by, the, catholic, church, and, as, a, saint, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, lutheran, church, and, the, anglican, communion, his, feast, day, is, 30, september, gregorian, calendar, eusebius, sophronius, hieronymus, was, born, at, stridon, around, 342, 347, ad, he, was, of, illyrian, ancestry, he, was, not, baptized, until, about, 360, 369, in, rome, where, he, had, gone, with, his, friend, bonosus, of, sardica, to, pursue, rhetorical, and, philosophical, studies, this, bonosus, may, or, may, not, have, been, the, same, bonosus, whom, jerome, identifies, as, his, friend, who, went, to, live, as, a, hermit, on, an, island, in, the, adriatic, jerome, studied, under, the, philologist, aelius, donatus, there, he, learned, latin, and, at, least, some, koine, greek, though, he, probably, did, not, yet, acquire, the, familiarity, with, greek, literature, that, he, later, claimed, to, have, acquired, as, a, schoolboy, as, a, student, jerome, engaged, in, the, superficial, escapades, and, sexual, experimentation, of, students, in, rome, he, indulged, himself, quite, casually, but, he, suffered, terrible, bouts, of, guilt, afterwards, to, appease, his, conscience, on, sundays, he, visited, the, sepulchers, of, the, martyrs, and, the, apostles, in, the, catacombs, this, experience, reminded, him, of, the, terrors, of, hell, often, i, would, find, myself, entering, those, crypts, deep, dug, in, the, earth, with, their, walls, on, either, side, lined, with, the, bodies, of, the, dead, where, everything, was, so, dark, that, almost, it, seemed, as, though, the, psalmist, s, words, were, fulfilled, let, them, go, down, quick, into, hell, here, and, there, the, light, not, entering, in, through, windows, but, filtering, down, from, above, through, shafts, relieved, the, horror, of, the, darkness, but, again, as, soon, as, you, found, yourself, cautiously, moving, forward, the, black, night, closed, around, and, there, came, to, my, mind, the, line, of, virgil, horror, ubique, animos, simul, ipsa, silentia, terrent, the, quotation, from, virgil, reads, in, translation, on, all, sides, round, horror, spread, wide, the, very, silence, breathed, a, terror, on, my, soul, although, at, first, afraid, of, christianity, he, eventually, converted, seized, with, a, desire, for, a, life, of, ascetic, penance, jerome, went, for, a, time, to, the, desert, of, chalcis, to, the, southeast, of, antioch, known, as, the, syrian, thebaid, from, the, number, of, eremites, hermits, inhabiting, it, during, this, period, he, seems, to, have, found, time, for, studying, and, writing, he, made, his, first, attempt, to, learn, hebrew, under, the, guidance, of, a, converted, jew, and, he, seems, to, have, been, in, correspondence, with, jewish, christians, in, antioch, around, this, time, he, had, copied, for, himself, a, hebrew, gospel, of, which, fragments, are, preserved, in, his, notes, it, is, known, today, as, the, gospel, of, the, hebrews, which, the, nazarenes, considered, to, be, the, true, gospel, of, matthew, jerome, translated, parts, of, this, hebrew, gospel, into, greek, as, prot, g, of, pope, damasus, i, jerome, was, given, duties, in, rome, and, he, undertook, a, revision, of, the, vetus, latina, gospels, based, on, greek, manuscripts, he, also, updated, the, psalter, containing, the, book, of, psalms, then, in, use, in, rome, based, on, the, septuagint, throughout, his, epistles, he, shows, himself, to, be, surrounded, by, women, and, united, with, close, ties, it, is, estimated, that, 40, of, his, epistles, were, addressed, to, someone, of, the, female, sex, and, at, the, time, he, was, criticized, for, it, even, in, his, time, jerome, noted, porphyry, s, accusation, that, the, christian, communities, were, run, by, women, and, that, the, favor, of, the, ladies, decided, who, could, accede, to, the, dignity, of, the, priesthood, in, rome, jerome, was, surrounded, by, a, circle, of, well, born, and, well, educated, women, including, some, from, the, noblest, patrician, families, among, these, women, were, such, as, the, widows, lea, marcella, and, paula, and, paula, s, daughters, blaesilla, and, eustochium, the, resulting, inclination, of, these, women, towards, the, monastic, life, away, from, the, indulgent, lasciviousness, in, rome, and, his, unsparing, criticism, of, the, secular, clergy, of, rome, brought, a, growing, hostility, against, him, among, the, roman, clergy, and, their, supporters, soon, after, the, death, of, his, patron, pope, damasus, i, on, 10, december, 384, jerome, was, forced, to, leave, his, position, at, rome, after, an, inquiry, was, brought, up, by, the, roman, clergy, into, allegations, that, he, had, an, improper, relationship, with, the, widow, paula, still, his, writings, were, highly, regarded, by, women, who, were, attempting, to, maintain, vows, of, becoming, consecrated, virgins, his, letters, were, widely, read, and, distributed, throughout, the, christian, empire, and, it, is, clear, through, his, writing, that, he, knew, these, virgin, women, were, not, his, only, audience, additionally, jerome, s, condemnation, of, blaesilla, s, hedonistic, lifestyle, in, rome, led, her, to, adopt, ascetic, practices, but, these, affected, her, health, and, worsened, her, physical, weakness, to, the, point, that, she, died, just, four, months, after, starting, to, follow, his, instructions, much, of, the, roman, populace, was, outraged, that, jerome, in, their, view, thus, caused, the, premature, death, of, such, a, lively, young, woman, additionally, his, insistence, to, paula, that, blaesilla, should, not, be, mourned, and, complaints, that, her, grief, was, excessive, were, seen, as, heartless, which, further, polarized, roman, opinion, against, him, jerome, was, a, scholar, at, a, time, when, that, statement, implied, a, fluency, in, greek, he, knew, some, hebrew, when, he, started, his, translation, project, but, moved, to, jerusalem, to, strengthen, his, grip, on, jewish, scripture, commentary, a, wealthy, roman, aristocrat, paula, funded, jerome, s, stay, in, a, monastery, in, the, nearby, city, of, bethlehem, where, he, settled, next, to, the, church, of, the, nativity, built, half, a, century, prior, on, orders, of, emperor, constantine, over, what, was, reputed, to, be, the, site, of, the, nativity, of, jesus, and, he, completed, his, translation, there, he, began, in, 382, by, correcting, the, existing, latin, language, version, of, the, new, testament, commonly, referred, to, as, the, vetus, latina, by, 390, he, turned, to, translating, the, hebrew, bible, from, the, original, hebrew, having, previously, translated, portions, from, the, septuagint, which, came, from, alexandria, he, believed, that, the, mainstream, rabbinical, judaism, had, rejected, the, septuagint, as, invalid, jewish, scriptural, texts, because, of, what, were, ascertained, as, mistranslations, along, with, its, hellenistic, heretical, elements, he, completed, this, work, by, 405, prior, to, jerome, s, vulgate, all, latin, translations, of, the, old, testament, were, based, on, the, septuagint, not, the, hebrew, jerome, s, decision, to, use, a, hebrew, text, instead, of, the, previous, translated, septuagint, went, against, the, advice, of, most, other, christians, including, augustine, who, thought, the, septuagint, inspired, modern, scholarship, however, has, sometimes, cast, doubts, on, the, actual, quality, of, jerome, s, hebrew, knowledge, many, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, greek, hexapla, is, the, main, source, for, jerome, s, iuxta, hebraeos, i, e, close, to, the, hebrews, immediately, following, the, hebrews, translation, of, the, old, testament, however, detailed, studies, have, shown, that, to, a, considerable, degree, jerome, was, a, competent, hebraist, jerome, also, produced, two, onomastica, for, the, next, 15, years, until, he, died, jerome, produced, a, number, of, commentaries, on, scripture, often, explaining, his, translation, choices, in, using, the, original, hebrew, rather, than, suspect, translations, his, patristic, commentaries, align, closely, with, jewish, tradition, and, he, indulges, in, allegorical, and, mystical, subtleties, after, the, manner, of, philo, and, the, alexandrian, school, unlike, his, contemporaries, he, emphasizes, the, difference, between, the, hebrew, bible, apocrypha, and, the, hebraica, veritas, of, the, protocanonical, books, in, his, vulgate, s, prologues, he, describes, some, portions, of, books, in, the, septuagint, that, were, not, found, in, the, hebrew, as, being, non, canonical, he, called, them, apocrypha, for, baruch, he, mentions, by, name, in, his, prologue, to, jeremiah, and, notes, that, it, is, neither, read, nor, held, among, the, hebrews, but, does, not, explicitly, call, it, apocryphal, or, not, in, the, canon, his, preface, to, the, books, of, samuel, and, kings, commonly, called, the, helmeted, preface, includes, the, following, statement, this, preface, to, the, scriptures, may, serve, as, a, helmeted, introduction, to, all, the, books, which, we, turn, from, hebrew, into, latin, so, that, we, may, be, assured, that, what, is, not, found, in, our, list, must, be, placed, amongst, the, apocryphal, writings, wisdom, therefore, which, generally, bears, the, name, of, solomon, and, the, book, of, jesus, the, son, of, sirach, and, judith, and, tobias, and, the, shepherd, are, not, in, the, canon, the, first, book, of, maccabees, i, have, found, to, be, hebrew, the, second, is, greek, as, can, be, proved, from, the, very, style, the, following, passage, taken, from, jerome, s, life, of, st, hilarion, which, was, written, c, 392, appears, to, be, the, earliest, account, of, the, etiology, symptoms, and, cure, of, severe, vitamin, a, deficiency, from, his, thirty, first, to, his, thirty, fifth, year, he, had, for, food, six, ounces, of, barley, bread, and, vegetables, slightly, cooked, without, oil, but, finding, that, his, eyes, were, growing, dim, and, that, his, whole, body, was, shrivelled, with, an, eruption, and, a, sort, of, stony, roughness, impetigine, et, pumicea, quad, scabredine, he, added, oil, to, his, former, food, and, up, to, the, sixty, third, year, of, his, life, followed, this, temperate, course, tasting, neither, fruit, nor, pulse, nor, anything, whatsoever, besides, jerome, s, letters, or, epistles, both, by, the, great, variety, of, their, subjects, and, by, their, qualities, of, style, form, an, important, portion, of, his, literary, remains, whether, he, is, discussing, problems, of, scholarship, or, reasoning, on, cases, of, conscience, comforting, the, afflicted, or, saying, pleasant, things, to, his, friends, scourging, the, vices, and, corruptions, of, the, time, and, against, sexual, immorality, among, the, clergy, exhorting, to, the, ascetic, life, and, renunciation, of, the, world, or, debating, his, theological, opponents, he, gives, a, vivid, picture, not, only, of, his, own, mind, but, of, the, age, and, its, peculiar, characteristics, see, plowboy, trope, because, there, was, no, distinct, line, between, personal, documents, and, those, meant, for, publication, we, frequently, find, in, his, letters, both, confidential, messages, and, treatises, meant, for, others, besides, the, one, to, whom, he, was, writing, due, to, the, time, he, spent, in, rome, among, wealthy, families, belonging, to, the, roman, upper, class, jerome, was, frequently, commissioned, by, women, who, had, taken, a, vow, of, virginity, to, write, to, them, in, guidance, of, how, to, live, their, life, as, a, result, he, spent, a, great, deal, of, his, life, corresponding, with, these, women, about, certain, abstentions, and, lifestyle, practices, jerome, warned, that, those, substituting, false, interpretations, for, the, actual, meaning, of, scripture, belonged, to, the, synagogue, of, the, antichrist, he, that, is, not, of, christ, is, of, antichrist, he, wrote, to, pope, damasus, i, he, believed, that, the, mystery, of, iniquity, written, about, by, paul, in, 2, thessalonians, 2, 7, was, already, in, action, when, every, one, chatters, about, his, views, to, jerome, the, power, restraining, this, mystery, of, iniquity, was, the, roman, empire, but, as, it, fell, this, restraining, force, was, removed, he, warned, a, noblewoman, of, gaul, he, that, letteth, is, taken, out, of, the, way, and, yet, we, do, not, realize, that, antichrist, is, near, yes, antichrist, is, near, whom, the, lord, jesus, christ, shall, consume, with, the, spirit, of, his, mouth, woe, unto, them, he, cries, that, are, with, child, and, to, them, that, give, suck, in, those, days, savage, tribes, in, countless, numbers, have, overrun, all, parts, of, gaul, the, whole, country, between, the, alps, and, the, pyrenees, between, the, rhine, and, the, ocean, has, been, laid, waste, by, hordes, of, quadi, vandals, sarmatians, alans, gepids, herules, saxons, burgundians, allemanni, and, alas, for, the, commonweal, even, pannonians, his, commentary, on, daniel, was, expressly, written, to, offset, the, criticisms, of, porphyry, who, taught, that, daniel, related, entirely, to, the, time, of, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, and, was, written, by, an, unknown, individual, living, in, the, second, century, bc, against, porphyry, jerome, identified, rome, as, the, fourth, kingdom, of, chapters, two, and, seven, but, his, view, of, chapters, eight, and, eleven, was, more, complex, jerome, held, that, chapter, eight, describes, the, activity, of, antiochus, epiphanes, who, is, understood, as, a, type, of, a, future, antichrist, 11, 24, onwards, applies, primarily, to, a, future, antichrist, but, was, partially, fulfilled, by, antiochus, instead, he, advocated, that, the, little, horn, was, the, antichrist, we, should, therefore, concur, with, the, traditional, interpretation, of, all, the, commentators, of, the, christian, church, that, at, the, end, of, the, world, when, the, roman, empire, is, to, be, destroyed, there, shall, be, ten, kings, who, will, partition, the, roman, world, amongst, themselves, then, an, insignificant, eleventh, king, will, arise, who, will, overcome, three, of, the, ten, kings, after, they, have, been, slain, the, seven, other, kings, also, will, bow, their, necks, to, the, victor, in, his, commentary, on, daniel, he, noted, let, us, not, follow, the, opinion, of, some, commentators, and, suppose, him, to, be, either, the, devil, or, some, demon, but, rather, one, of, the, human, race, in, whom, satan, will, wholly, take, up, his, residence, in, bodily, form, instead, of, rebuilding, the, jewish, temple, to, reign, from, jerome, thought, the, antichrist, sat, in, god, s, temple, inasmuch, as, he, made, himself, out, to, be, like, god, jerome, identified, the, four, prophetic, kingdoms, symbolized, in, daniel, 2, as, the, neo, babylonian, empire, the, medes, and, persians, macedon, and, rome, ch, 2, vv, 31, 40, jerome, identified, the, stone, cut, out, without, hands, as, namely, the, lord, and, savior, ch, 2, v, 40, jerome, refuted, porphyry, s, application, of, the, little, horn, of, chapter, seven, to, antiochus, he, expected, that, at, the, end, of, the, world, rome, would, be, destroyed, and, partitioned, among, ten, kingdoms, before, the, little, horn, appeared, ch, 7, v, 8, jerome, believed, that, cyrus, of, persia, is, the, higher, of, the, two, horns, of, the, medo, persian, ram, of, daniel, 8, 3, the, he, goat, is, greece, smiting, persia, ch, 8, v, 5, jerome, opposed, the, doctrine, of, pelagianism, and, wrote, against, it, three, years, before, his, death, jerome, despite, being, opposed, to, origen, was, influenced, by, origenism, in, his, soteriology, although, he, taught, that, the, devil, and, the, unbelieving, will, be, eternally, punished, unlike, origen, he, believed, that, the, punishment, for, christian, sinners, who, have, once, believed, but, sin, and, fall, away, will, be, temporal, in, nature, some, scholars, such, as, j, n, d, kelly, have, also, interpreted, ambrose, to, have, held, similar, views, considering, the, judgement, of, christians, although, augustine, does, not, name, jerome, personally, the, view, that, all, christians, would, eventually, be, reunited, to, god, was, criticized, by, augustine, in, his, treatise, on, faith, and, works, jerome, is, the, second, most, voluminous, writer, after, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, in, ancient, latin, christianity, the, catholic, church, recognizes, him, as, the, patron, saint, of, translators, librarians, and, encyclopedists, jerome, translated, many, biblical, texts, into, latin, from, hebrew, aramaic, and, greek, his, translations, formed, part, of, the, vulgate, the, vulgate, eventually, superseded, the, preceding, latin, translations, of, the, bible, the, vetus, latina, the, council, of, trent, in, 1546, declared, the, vulgate, authoritative, in, public, lectures, disputations, sermons, and, expositions, jerome, showed, more, zeal, and, interest, in, the, ascetic, ideal, than, in, abstract, speculation, he, lived, as, an, ascetic, for, 4, 5, years, in, the, syrian, desert, and, later, near, bethlehem, for, 34, years, nevertheless, his, writings, show, outstanding, scholarship, and, his, correspondence, has, great, historical, importance, the, church, of, england, honours, jerome, with, a, commemoration, on, 30, september, jerome, is, also, often, depicted, with, a, lion, in, reference, to, the, popular, hagiographical, belief, that, jerome, once, tamed, a, lion, in, the, wilderness, by, healing, its, paw, the, source, for, the, story, may, actually, have, been, the, second, century, roman, tale, of, androcles, or, confusion, with, the, exploits, of, gerasimus, jerome, in, later, latin, is, geronimus, it, is, a, figment, found, in, the, thirteenth, century, golden, legend, by, jacobus, de, voragine, hagiographies, of, jerome, talk, of, his, having, spent, many, years, in, the, syrian, desert, and, artists, often, depict, him, in, a, wilderness, which, for, west, european, painters, can, take, the, form, of, a, wood, from, the, late, middle, ages, depictions, of, jerome, in, a, wider, setting, became, popular, he, is, either, shown, in, his, study, surrounded, by, books, and, the, equipment, of, a, scholar, or, in, a, rocky, desert, or, in, a, setting, that, combines, both, aspects, with, him, studying, a, book, under, the, shelter, of, a, rock, face, or, cave, mouth, his, study, is, often, shown, as, large, and, well, provided, for, he, is, often, clean, shaven, and, well, dressed, and, a, cardinal, s, hat, may, appear, these, images, derive, from, the, tradition, of, the, evangelist, portrait, though, jerome, is, often, given, the, library, and, desk, of, a, serious, scholar, his, attribute, of, the, lion, often, shown, at, a, smaller, scale, may, be, beside, him, in, either, setting, the, subject, of, jerome,
