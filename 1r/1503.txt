sir, william, wallace, scottish, gaelic, uilleam, uallas, pronounced, norman, french, william, le, waleys, c, 1270, 23, august, 1305, was, a, scottish, knight, who, became, one, of, the, main, leaders, during, the, first, war, of, scottish, independence, along, with, andrew, moray, wallace, defeated, an, english, army, at, the, battle, of, stirling, bridge, in, september, 1297, he, was, appointed, guardian, of, scotland, and, served, until, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, in, july, 1298, in, august, 1305, wallace, was, captured, in, robroyston, near, glasgow, and, handed, over, to, king, edward, i, of, england, who, had, him, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, for, high, treason, and, crimes, against, english, civilians, since, his, death, wallace, has, obtained, a, legendary, status, beyond, his, homeland, he, is, the, protagonist, of, blind, harry, s, 15th, century, epic, poem, the, wallace, and, the, subject, of, literary, works, by, jane, porter, and, sir, walter, scott, and, of, the, academy, award, winning, film, braveheart, william, wallace, was, a, member, of, the, lesser, nobility, but, little, is, definitely, known, of, his, family, history, or, even, his, parentage, william, s, own, seal, found, on, a, letter, sent, to, the, hanse, city, of, l, beck, in, 1297, gives, his, father, s, name, as, alan, wallace, this, alan, wallace, may, be, the, same, as, the, one, listed, in, the, 1296, ragman, rolls, as, a, crown, tenant, in, ayrshire, but, there, is, no, additional, confirmation, others, have, speculated, this, alan, held, ellerslie, near, kilmarnock, ayrshire, and, if, true, the, estate, could, be, a, possible, birthplace, for, william, though, there, is, no, record, of, wallaces, holding, the, estate, in, the, mid, 13th, century, blind, harry, s, late, 15th, century, poem, offers, an, alternate, father, for, william, a, sir, malcolm, of, elderslie, in, renfrewshire, and, has, similarly, given, rise, to, a, possible, birthplace, for, william, there, is, no, contemporary, evidence, linking, him, with, either, location, although, both, areas, had, connections, with, the, wider, wallace, family, records, show, early, members, of, the, family, as, holding, estates, at, riccarton, tarbolton, auchincruive, in, kyle, and, stenton, in, east, lothian, they, were, vassals, of, james, stewart, 5th, high, steward, of, scotland, as, their, lands, fell, within, his, territory, it, has, been, claimed, that, wallace, s, brothers, malcolm, and, john, are, known, from, other, sources, but, there, is, a, lack, of, verifiable, evidence, for, john, s, relationship, with, william, the, origins, of, the, wallace, surname, and, its, association, with, southwest, scotland, are, also, far, from, certain, other, than, the, name, s, being, derived, from, the, old, english, wylisc, pronounced, wullish, meaning, foreigner, or, welshman, it, is, possible, that, all, the, wallaces, in, the, clyde, area, were, medieval, immigrants, from, wales, but, as, the, term, was, also, used, for, the, cumbric, speaking, strathclyde, kingdom, of, the, celtic, britons, it, seems, equally, likely, that, the, surname, refers, to, people, who, were, seen, as, being, welsh, due, to, their, cumbric, language, when, wallace, was, growing, up, king, alexander, iii, ruled, scotland, his, reign, had, seen, a, period, of, peace, and, economic, stability, on, 19, march, 1286, however, alexander, died, after, falling, from, his, horse, the, heir, to, the, throne, was, alexander, s, granddaughter, margaret, maid, of, norway, as, she, was, still, a, child, and, in, norway, the, scottish, lords, set, up, a, government, of, guardians, margaret, fell, ill, on, the, voyage, to, scotland, and, died, in, orkney, in, late, september, 1290, the, lack, of, a, clear, heir, led, to, a, period, known, as, the, great, cause, with, a, total, of, thirteen, contenders, laying, claim, to, the, throne, the, most, credible, claims, were, john, balliol, and, robert, bruce, grandfather, of, the, future, king, robert, the, bruce, with, scotland, threatening, to, descend, into, civil, war, king, edward, i, of, england, was, invited, in, by, the, scottish, nobility, to, arbitrate, before, the, process, could, begin, he, insisted, that, all, of, the, contenders, recognise, him, as, lord, paramount, of, scotland, in, early, november, 1292, at, a, great, feudal, court, held, in, the, castle, at, berwick, upon, tweed, judgment, was, given, in, favour, of, john, balliol, having, the, strongest, claim, in, law, based, on, being, senior, in, genealogical, primogeniture, even, though, not, in, proximity, of, blood, edward, proceeded, to, take, steps, to, progressively, undermine, john, s, authority, treating, scotland, as, a, feudal, vassal, state, demanding, homage, be, paid, towards, himself, and, military, support, in, his, war, against, france, even, summoning, king, john, balliol, to, stand, before, the, english, court, as, a, common, plaintiff, the, scots, soon, tired, of, their, deeply, compromised, king, and, the, direction, of, affairs, was, allegedly, taken, out, of, his, hands, by, the, leading, men, of, the, kingdom, who, appointed, a, council, of, twelve, in, practice, a, new, panel, of, guardians, at, stirling, in, july, 1295, they, went, on, to, conclude, a, treaty, of, mutual, assistance, with, france, known, in, later, years, as, the, auld, alliance, in, retaliation, for, scotland, s, treaty, with, france, edward, i, invaded, storming, berwick, upon, tweed, and, commencing, the, wars, of, scottish, independence, the, scots, were, defeated, at, dunbar, and, the, english, took, dunbar, castle, on, 27, april, 1296, edward, forced, john, to, abdicate, which, he, did, at, stracathro, near, montrose, on, 10, july, 1296, here, the, arms, of, scotland, were, formally, torn, from, john, s, surcoat, giving, him, the, abiding, name, of, toom, tabard, empty, coat, by, july, edward, had, instructed, his, officers, to, receive, formal, homage, from, some, 1, 800, scottish, nobles, many, of, the, rest, being, prisoners, of, war, at, that, time, some, historians, believe, wallace, must, have, had, some, earlier, military, experience, in, order, to, lead, a, successful, military, campaign, in, 1297, campaigns, like, edward, i, of, england, s, wars, in, wales, might, have, provided, a, good, opportunity, for, a, younger, son, of, a, landholder, to, become, a, mercenary, soldier, wallace, s, personal, seal, bears, the, archer, s, insignia, so, he, may, have, fought, as, an, archer, in, edward, s, army, walter, bower, s, mid, 15th, century, scotichronicon, states, that, wallace, was, a, tall, man, with, the, body, of, a, giant, with, lengthy, flanks, broad, in, the, hips, with, strong, arms, and, legs, with, all, his, limbs, very, strong, and, firm, blind, harry, s, late, 15th, century, poem, the, wallace, asserts, wallace, reached, seven, feet, the, first, act, definitely, known, to, have, been, carried, out, by, wallace, was, his, killing, of, william, de, heselrig, the, english, high, sheriff, of, lanark, in, may, 1297, he, then, joined, with, william, the, hardy, lord, of, douglas, and, they, carried, out, the, raid, of, scone, this, was, one, of, several, rebellions, taking, place, across, scotland, including, those, of, several, scottish, nobles, and, andrew, moray, in, the, north, the, uprising, suffered, a, blow, when, the, nobles, submitted, to, the, english, at, irvine, in, july, wallace, and, moray, were, not, involved, and, continued, their, rebellions, wallace, used, the, ettrick, forest, as, a, base, for, raiding, and, attacked, wishart, s, palace, at, ancrum, wallace, and, moray, met, and, joined, their, forces, possibly, at, the, siege, of, dundee, in, early, september, on, 11, september, 1297, an, army, jointly, led, by, wallace, and, andrew, moray, won, the, battle, of, stirling, bridge, although, vastly, outnumbered, the, scottish, army, routed, the, english, army, john, de, warenne, 6th, earl, of, surrey, s, feudal, army, of, 3, 000, cavalry, and, 8, 000, to, 10, 000, infantry, met, disaster, as, they, crossed, over, to, the, north, side, of, the, river, the, narrowness, of, the, bridge, prevented, many, soldiers, from, crossing, together, possibly, as, few, as, three, men, abreast, so, while, the, english, soldiers, crossed, the, scots, held, back, until, half, of, them, had, passed, and, then, killed, the, english, as, quickly, as, they, could, cross, the, infantry, were, sent, on, first, followed, by, heavy, cavalry, the, scots, schiltron, formations, forced, the, infantry, back, into, the, advancing, cavalry, a, pivotal, charge, led, by, one, of, wallace, s, captains, caused, some, of, the, english, soldiers, to, retreat, as, others, pushed, forward, and, under, the, overwhelming, weight, the, bridge, collapsed, and, many, english, soldiers, drowned, thus, the, scots, won, a, significant, victory, boosting, the, confidence, of, their, army, hugh, de, cressingham, edward, s, treasurer, in, scotland, died, in, the, fighting, and, it, is, reputed, that, his, body, was, subsequently, flayed, and, the, skin, cut, into, small, pieces, as, tokens, of, the, victory, the, lanercost, chronicle, records, that, wallace, had, a, broad, strip, taken, from, the, head, to, the, heel, to, make, therewith, a, baldrick, for, his, sword, after, the, battle, moray, and, wallace, assumed, the, title, of, guardians, of, the, kingdom, of, scotland, on, behalf, of, king, john, balliol, moray, died, of, wounds, suffered, on, the, battlefield, sometime, in, late, 1297, wallace, soon, mounted, an, invasion, of, northern, england, crossing, into, northumberland, the, scots, army, followed, the, english, army, fleeing, south, caught, between, two, armies, hundreds, of, refugees, fled, to, safety, behind, the, walls, of, newcastle, the, scots, laid, waste, a, swathe, of, countryside, before, turning, west, into, cumberland, and, pillaging, all, the, way, to, cockermouth, before, wallace, led, his, men, back, into, northumberland, and, fired, 700, villages, wallace, then, returned, from, england, laden, with, booty, in, a, ceremony, at, the, kirk, o, the, forest, selkirk, towards, the, end, of, the, year, wallace, was, knighted, this, would, have, been, carried, out, by, one, of, three, scottish, earls, carrick, strathearn, or, lennox, in, april, 1298, edward, ordered, a, second, invasion, of, scotland, two, days, prior, to, the, battle, 25, 781, foot, soldiers, were, paid, more, than, half, of, them, would, have, been, welsh, there, are, no, clear, cut, sources, for, the, presence, of, cavalry, but, it, is, safe, to, assume, that, edward, had, roughly, 1, 500, horse, under, his, command, they, plundered, lothian, and, regained, some, castles, but, failed, to, bring, william, wallace, to, combat, the, scots, shadowed, the, english, army, intending, to, avoid, battle, until, shortages, of, supplies, and, money, forced, edward, to, withdraw, at, which, point, the, scots, would, harass, his, retreat, the, english, quartermasters, failure, to, prepare, for, the, expedition, left, morale, and, food, supplies, low, and, a, resulting, riot, within, edward, s, own, army, had, to, be, put, down, by, his, cavalry, in, july, while, planning, a, return, to, edinburgh, for, supplies, edward, received, intelligence, that, the, scots, were, encamped, nearby, at, falkirk, and, he, moved, quickly, to, engage, them, in, the, pitched, battle, he, had, long, hoped, for, wallace, arranged, his, spearmen, in, four, schiltrons, circular, defensive, hedgehog, formations, probably, surrounded, by, wooden, stakes, connected, with, ropes, to, keep, the, infantry, in, formation, the, english, however, employed, welsh, longbowmen, who, swung, tactical, superiority, in, their, favour, the, english, proceeded, to, attack, with, cavalry, and, put, the, scottish, archers, to, flight, the, scottish, cavalry, withdrew, as, well, due, to, its, inferiority, to, the, english, heavy, horses, edward, s, men, began, to, attack, the, schiltrons, which, were, still, able, to, inflict, heavy, casualties, on, the, english, cavalry, it, remains, unclear, whether, the, infantry, shooting, bolts, arrows, and, stones, at, the, spearmen, proved, the, deciding, factor, although, it, is, very, likely, that, it, was, the, arrows, of, edward, s, bowmen, gaps, in, the, schiltrons, soon, appeared, and, the, english, exploited, these, to, crush, the, remaining, resistance, the, scots, lost, many, men, including, john, de, graham, wallace, escaped, though, his, military, reputation, suffered, badly, by, september, 1298, wallace, resigned, as, guardian, of, scotland, in, favour, of, robert, the, bruce, earl, of, carrick, and, future, king, and, john, comyn, king, john, balliol, s, nephew, details, of, wallace, s, activities, after, this, are, vague, but, there, is, some, evidence, that, he, left, on, a, mission, to, the, court, of, king, philip, iv, of, france, to, plead, the, case, for, assistance, in, the, scottish, struggle, for, independence, there, is, a, surviving, letter, from, the, french, king, dated, 7, november, 1300, to, his, envoys, in, rome, demanding, that, they, should, help, sir, william, it, also, suggests, that, wallace, intended, to, travel, to, rome, although, it, is, not, known, if, he, did, there, is, also, a, report, from, an, english, spy, at, a, meeting, of, scottish, leaders, where, they, said, wallace, was, in, france, by, 1304, wallace, was, back, in, scotland, and, involved, in, skirmishes, at, happrew, and, earnside, wallace, evaded, capture, by, the, english, until, 5, august, 1305, when, john, de, menteith, a, scottish, knight, loyal, to, edward, turned, wallace, over, to, english, soldiers, at, robroyston, near, glasgow, a, site, commemorated, by, a, small, monument, in, the, form, of, a, celtic, cross, letters, of, safe, conduct, from, haakon, v, of, norway, philip, iv, of, france, and, john, balliol, along, with, other, documents, were, found, in, wallace, s, possession, and, delivered, to, edward, by, john, de, segrave, wallace, was, transported, to, london, and, taken, to, westminster, hall, there, he, was, tried, for, treason, for, which, his, defence, was, that, he, unlike, most, of, the, other, scottish, leaders, had, never, sworn, allegiance, to, edward, he, was, also, charged, with, committing, atrocities, against, civilians, in, war, sparing, neither, age, nor, sex, monk, nor, nun, as, a, result, the, trial, has, attracted, the, attention, of, modern, legal, scholarship, as, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, what, would, now, be, considered, a, prosecution, for, war, crimes, it, is, one, of, only, three, known, pre, modern, trials, which, raised, in, today, s, terms, issues, of, international, humanitarian, law, following, the, trial, on, 23, august, 1305, wallace, was, taken, from, the, hall, to, the, tower, of, london, then, stripped, naked, and, dragged, through, the, city, at, the, heels, of, a, horse, to, the, elms, at, smithfield, he, was, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, strangled, by, hanging, but, released, while, he, was, still, alive, emasculated, eviscerated, with, his, bowels, burned, before, him, beheaded, then, cut, into, four, parts, wallace, s, head, was, dipped, in, tar, and, placed, on, a, spike, atop, london, bridge, his, preserved, head, was, later, joined, by, the, heads, of, his, brother, john, and, his, compatriots, simon, fraser, and, john, of, strathbogie, wallace, s, limbs, were, displayed, separately, in, newcastle, berwick, stirling, and, perth, a, plaque, unveiled, 8, april, 1956, stands, in, a, wall, of, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, near, the, site, of, wallace, s, execution, at, smithfield, it, includes, in, latin, the, words, dico, tibi, verum, libertas, optima, rerum, nunquam, servili, sub, nexu, vivito, fili, i, tell, you, the, truth, freedom, is, what, is, best, son, never, live, your, life, like, a, slave, and, in, gaelic, bas, agus, buaidh, death, and, victory, an, old, scottish, battle, cry, in, 1869, the, wallace, monument, was, erected, close, to, the, site, of, his, victory, at, stirling, bridge, the, wallace, sword, which, supposedly, belonged, to, wallace, although, some, parts, were, made, at, least, 160, years, later, was, held, for, many, years, in, dumbarton, castle, and, is, now, in, the, wallace, monument
