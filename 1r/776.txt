the, years, following, his, death, he, continued, to, be, a, controversial, figure, in, academic, circles, however, with, the, arrival, of, the, internet, and, the, world, wide, web, interest, was,

the, autumn, of, 1934, studied, under, i, a, richards, and, f, r, leavis, and, was, influenced, by, new, criticism, years, afterward, upon, reflection, he, credited, the, faculty, there, with, influencing, the, direction, of, his, later, work, because, of, their, emphasis, on, the, training, of, perception, as, well, as, such, concepts, as, richards, notion, of, feedforward, these, studies, formed, an, important, precursor, to, his, later, ideas, on, technological, forms, he, received, the, required, bachelor, s, degree, from, cambridge, in, 1936, and, entered, their, graduate, program, at, the, university, of, manitoba, mcluhan, explored, his, conflicted, relationship, with, religion, and, turned, to, literature, to, gratify, his, soul, s, hunger, for, truth, and, beauty, later, referring, to, this, stage, as, agnosticism, while, studying, the, trivium, at, cambridge, he, took, the, first, steps, toward, his, eventual, conversion, to, catholicism, in, 1937, founded, on, his, reading, of, g, k, chesterton, in, 1935, he, wrote, to, his, mother, had, i, not, encountered, chesterton, i, would, have, remained, agnostic, for, many, years, at, least, chesterton, did, not, convince, me, of, religious, faith, but, he, prevented, my, despair, from, becoming, a, habit, or, hardening, into, misanthropy, he, opened, my, eyes, to, european, culture, and, encouraged, me, to, know, it, more, closely, he, taught, me, the, reasons, for, all, that, in, me, was, simply, blind, anger, and, misery, at, the, end, of, march, 1937, mcluhan, completed, what, was, a, slow, but, total, conversion, process, when, he, was, formally, received, into, the, catholic, church, after, consulting, a, minister, his, father, accepted, the, decision, to, convert, his, mother, however, felt, that, his, conversion, would, hurt, his, career, and, was, inconsolable, mcluhan, was, devout, throughout, his, life, but, his, religion, remained, a, private, matter, he, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, the, number, three, e, g, the, trivium, the, trinity, and, sometimes, said, that, the, virgin, mary, provided, intellectual, guidance, for, him, for, the, rest, of, his, career, he, taught, in, catholic, institutions, of, higher, education, unable, to, find, a, suitable, job, in, canada, he, went, to, the, united, states, to, take, a, job, as, a, teaching, assistant, at, the,

toronto, where, hugh, kenner, would, be, one, of, his, students, canadian, economist, and, communications, scholar, harold, innis, was, a, university, colleague, who, had, a, strong, influence, on, his, work, mcluhan, wrote, in, 1964, i, am, pleased, to, think, of, my, own, book, the, gutenberg, galaxy, as, a, footnote, to, the, observations, of, innis, on, the, subject, of, the, psychic, and, social, consequences, first, of, writing, then, of, printing, in, the, early, 1950s, mcluhan, began, the, communication, and, culture, seminars, at, the, university, of, toronto, funded, by, the, ford, foundation, as, his, reputation, grew, he, received, a, growing, number, of, offers, from, other, universities, during, this, period, he, published, his, first, major, work, the, mechanical, bride, 1951, in, which, he, examines, the, effect, of, advertising, on, society, and, culture, throughout, the, 1950s, he, and, edmund, carpenter, also, produced, an, important, academic, journal, called, explorations, mcluhan, and, carpenter, have, been, characterized, as, the, toronto, school, of, communication, theory, together, with, harold, innis, eric, a, havelock, and, northrop, frye, during, this, time, mcluhan, supervised, the, doctoral, thesis, of, modernist, writer, sheila, watson, on, the, subject, of, wyndham, lewis, hoping, to, keep, him, from, moving, to, another, institute, the, university, of, toronto, created, the, centre, for, culture, and, technology, cct, in, 1963, from, 1967, to, 1968, mcluhan, was, named, the, albert, schweitzer, chair, in, humanities, at, fordham, university, in, the, bronx, while, at, fordham, he, was, diagnosed, with, a, benign, brain, tumor, which, was, treated, successfully, he, returned, to, toronto, where, he, taught, at, the, university, of, toronto, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, lived, in, wychwood, park, a, bucolic, enclave, on, a, hill, overlooking, the, downtown, where, anatol, rapoport, was, his, neighbour, in, 1970, he, was, made, a, companion, of, the, order, of, canada, in, 1975, the, university, of, dallas, hosted, him, from, april, to, may, appointing, him, to, the, mcdermott, chair, marshall, and, corinne, mcluhan, had, six, children, eric, twins, mary, and, teresa, stephanie, elizabeth, and, michael, the, associated, costs, of, a, large, family, eventually, drove, him, to, advertising, work, and, accepting, frequent, consulting, and, speaking, engagements, for, large, corporations, including, ibm, and, at, t, in, september, 1979, mcluhan, suffered, a, stroke, which, affected, his, ability, to, speak, the, university, of, toronto, s, school, of, graduate, studies, tried, to, close, his, research, center, shortly, thereafter, but, was, deterred, by, substantial, protests, mcluhan, never, fully, recovered, from, the, stroke, and, died, in, his, sleep, on, december, 31, 1980, he, is, buried, at, holy, cross, cemetery, in, thornhill, ontario, canada, during, his, years, at, saint, louis, university, 1937, 1944, mcluhan, worked, concurrently, on, two, projects, his, doctoral, dissertation, and, the, manuscript, that, was, eventually, published, in, 1951, as, a, book, titled, the, mechanical, bride, folklore, of, industrial, man, which, included, only, a, representative, selection, of, the, materials, that, mcluhan, had, prepared, for, it, mcluhan, s, 1942, cambridge, university, doctoral, dissertation, surveys, the, history, of, the, verbal, arts, grammar, logic, and, rhetoric, collectively, known, as, the, trivium, from, the, time, of, cicero, down, to, the, time, of, thomas, nashe, in, his, later, publications, mcluhan, at, times, uses, the, latin, concept, of, the, trivium, to, outline, an, orderly, and, systematic, picture, of, certain, periods, in, the, history, of, western, culture, mcluhan, suggests, that, the, late, middle, ages, for, instance, were, characterized, by, the, heavy, emphasis, on, the, formal, study, of, logic, the, key, development, that, led, to, the, renaissance, was, not, the, rediscovery, of, ancient, texts, but, a, shift, in, emphasis, from, the, formal, study, of, logic, to, rhetoric, and, grammar, modern, life, is, characterized, by, the, re, emergence, of, grammar, as, its, most, salient, feature, a, trend, mcluhan, felt, was, exemplified, by, the, new, criticism, of, richards, and, leavis, mcluhan, also, began, the, academic, journal, explorations, with, anthropologist, edmund, ted, carpenter, in, a, letter, to, walter, ong, dated, 31, may, 1953, mcluhan, reports, that, he, had, received, a, two, year, grant, of, 43, 000, from, the, ford, foundation, to, carry, out, a, communication, project, at, the, university, of, toronto, involving, faculty, from, different, disciplines, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, journal, at, a, fordham, lecture, in, 1999, tom, wolfe, suggested, that, a, major, under, acknowledged, influence, on, mcluhan, s, work, is, the, jesuit, philosopher, pierre, teilhard, de, chardin, whose, ideas, anticipated, those, of, mcluhan, especially, the, evolution, of, the, human, mind, into, the, noosphere, in, fact, mcluhan, warns, against, outright, dismissing, or, whole, heartedly, accepting, de, chardin, s, observations, early, on, in, his, second, published, book, the, gutenberg, galaxy, this, externalization, of, our, senses, creates, what, de, chardin, calls, the, noosphere, or, a, technological, brain, for, the, world, instead, of, tending, towards, a, vast, alexandrian, library, the, world, has, become, a, computer, an, electronic, brain, exactly, as, in, an, infantile, piece, of, science, fiction, and, as, our, senses, have, gone, outside, us, big, brother, goes, inside, so, unless, aware, of, this, dynamic, we, shall, at, once, move, into, a, phase, of, panic, terrors, exactly, befitting, a, small, world, of, tribal, drums, total, interdependence, and, super, imposed, co, existence, in, his, private, life, mcluhan, wrote, to, friends, saying, i, am, not, a, fan, of, pierre, teilhard, de, chardin, the, idea, that, anything, is, better, because, it, comes, later, is, surely, borrowed, from, pre, electronic, technologies, further, mcluhan, noted, to, a, catholic, collaborator, the, idea, of, a, cosmic, thrust, in, one, direction, is, surely, one, of, the, lamest, semantic, fallacies, ever, bred, by, the, word, evolution, that, development, should, have, any, direction, at, all, is, inconceivable, except, to, the, highly, literate, community, some, of, mcluhan, s, main, ideas, were, influenced, or, prefigured, by, anthropologists, like, edward, sapir, and, claude, l, vi, strauss, arguably, with, a, more, complex, historical, and, psychological, analysis, the, idea, of, the, retribalization, of, western, society, by, the, far, reaching, techniques, of, communication, the, view, on, the, function, of, the, artist, in, society, and, the, characterization, of, means, of, transportation, like, the, railroad, and, the, airplane, as, means, of, communication, are, prefigured, in, sapir, s, 1933, article, on, communication, in, the, encyclopaedia, of, the, social, sciences, while, the, distinction, between, hot, and, cool, media, draws, from, l, vi, strauss, distinction, between, hot, and, cold, societies, mcluhan, s, first, book, the, mechanical, bride, folklore, of, industrial, man, 1951, is, a, pioneering, study, in, the, field, now, known, as, popular, culture, in, the, book, mcluhan, turns, his, attention, to, analysing, and, commenting, on, numerous, examples, of, persuasion, in, contemporary, popular, culture, this, followed, naturally, from, his, earlier, work, as, both, dialectic, and, rhetoric, in, the, classical, trivium, aimed, at, persuasion, at, this, point, his, focus, shifted, dramatically, turning, inward, to, study, the, influence, of, communication, media, independent, of, their, content, his, famous, aphorism, the, medium, is, the, message, elaborated, in, his, understanding, media, the, extensions, of, man, 1964, calls, attention, to, this, intrinsic, effect, of, communications, media, his, interest, in, the, critical, study, of, popular, culture, was, influenced, by, the, 1933, book, culture, and, environment, by, f, r, leavis, and, denys, thompson, and, the, title, the, mechanical, bride, is, derived, from, a, piece, by, the, dadaist, artist, marcel, duchamp, the, mechanical, bride, is, composed, of, 59, short, essays, that, may, be, read, in, any, order, what, he, styled, the, mosaic, approach, to, writing, a, book, each, essay, begins, with, a, newspaper, or, magazine, article, or, an, advertisement, followed, by, mcluhan, s, analysis, thereof, the, analyses, bear, on, aesthetic, considerations, as, well, as, on, the, implications, behind, the, imagery, and, text, mcluhan, chose, these, ads, and, articles, not, only, to, draw, attention, to, their, symbolism, as, well, as, their, implications, for, the, corporate, entities, who, created, and, disseminated, them, but, also, to, mull, over, what, such, advertising, implies, about, the, wider, society, at, which, it, is, aimed, roland, barthes, s, essays, 1957, mythologies, echoes, mcluhan, s, mechanical, bride, as, a, series, of, exhibits, of, popular, mass, culture, like, advertisements, newspaper, articles, and, photographs, that, are, analyzed, in, a, semiological, way, written, in, 1961, and, first, published, by, university, of, toronto, press, the, gutenberg, galaxy, the, making, of, typographic, man, 1962, is, a, pioneering, study, in, the, fields, of, oral, culture, print, culture, cultural, studies, media, ecology, or, media, adequacy, throughout, the, book, mcluhan, makes, efforts, to, reveal, how, communication, technology, i, e, alphabetic, writing, the, printing, press, and, the, electronic, media, affects, cognitive, organization, which, in, turn, has, profound, ramifications, for, social, organization, f, a, new, technology, extends, one, or, more, of, our, senses, outside, us, into, the, social, world, then, new, ratios, among, all, of, our, senses, will, occur, in, that, particular, culture, it, is, comparable, to, what, happens, when, a, new, note, is, added, to, a, melody, and, when, the, sense, ratios, alter, in, any, culture, then, what, had, appeared, lucid, before, may, suddenly, become, opaque, and, what, had, been, vague, or, opaque, will, become, translucent, mcluhan, s, episodic, history, takes, the, reader, from, pre, alphabetic, tribal, humankind, to, the, electronic, age, according, to, mcluhan, the, invention, of, movable, type, greatly, accelerated, intensified, and, ultimately, enabled, cultural, and, cognitive, changes, that, had, already, been, taking, place, since, the, invention, and, implementation, of, the, alphabet, by, which, mcluhan, means, phonemic, orthography, mcluhan, is, careful, to, distinguish, the, phonetic, alphabet, from, logographic, or, logogramic, writing, systems, such, as, egyptian, hieroglyphs, or, ideograms, print, culture, ushered, in, by, the, advance, in, printing, during, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, when, the, gutenberg, press, was, invented, brought, about, the, cultural, predominance, of, the, visual, over, the, aural, oral, quoting, with, approval, an, observation, on, the, nature, of, the, printed, word, from, william, ivins, prints, and, visual, communication, mcluhan, remarks, in, this, passage, not, only, notes, the, ingraining, of, lineal, sequential, habits, but, even, more, important, points, out, the, visual, homogenizing, of, experience, of, print, culture, and, the, relegation, of, auditory, and, other, sensuous, complexity, to, the, background, the, technology, and, social, effects, of, typography, incline, us, to, abstain, from, noting, interplay, and, as, it, were, formal, causality, both, in, our, inner, and, external, lives, print, exists, by, virtue, of, the, static, separation, of, functions, and, fosters, a, mentality, that, gradually, resists, any, but, a, separative, and, compartmentalizing, or, specialist, outlook, the, main, concept, of, mcluhan, s, argument, later, elaborated, upon, in, the, medium, is, the, massage, is, that, new, technologies, such, as, alphabets, printing, presses, and, even, speech, exert, a, gravitational, effect, on, cognition, which, in, turn, affects, social, organization, print, technology, changes, our, perceptual, habits, visual, homogenizing, of, experience, which, in, turn, affects, social, interactions, fosters, a, mentality, that, gradually, resists, all, but, a, specialist, outlook, according, to, mcluhan, this, advance, of, print, technology, contributed, to, and, made, possible, most, of, the, salient, trends, in, the, modern, period, in, the, western, world, individualism, democracy, protestantism, capitalism, and, nationalism, for, mcluhan, these, trends, all, reverberate, with, print, technology, s, principle, of, segmentation, of, actions, and, functions, and, principle, of, visual, quantification, in, the, early, 1960s, mcluhan, wrote, that, the, visual, individualistic, print, culture, would, soon, be, brought, to, an, end, by, what, he, called, electronic, interdependence, wherein, electronic, media, replaces, visual, culture, with, aural, oral, culture, in, this, new, age, humankind, would, move, from, individualism, and, fragmentation, to, a, collective, identity, with, a, tribal, base, mcluhan, s, coinage, for, this, new, social, organization, is, the, global, village, the, term, is, sometimes, described, as, having, negative, connotations, in, the, gutenberg, galaxy, but, mcluhan, was, interested, in, exploring, effects, not, making, value, judgments, instead, of, tending, towards, a, vast, alexandrian, library, the, world, has, become, a, computer, an, electronic, brain, exactly, as, an, infantile, piece, of, science, fiction, and, as, our, senses, have, gone, outside, us, big, brother, goes, inside, so, unless, aware, of, this, dynamic, we, shall, at, once, move, into, a, phase, of, panic, terrors, exactly, befitting, a, small, world, of, tribal, drums, total, interdependence, and, superimposed, co, existence, terror, is, the, normal, state, of, any, oral, society, for, in, it, everything, affects, everything, all, the, time, in, our, long, striving, to, recover, for, the, western, world, a, unity, of, sensibility, and, of, thought, and, feeling, we, have, no, more, been, prepared, to, accept, the, tribal, consequences, of, such, unity, than, we, were, ready, for, the, fragmentation, of, the, human, psyche, by, print, culture, key, to, mcluhan, s, argument, is, the, idea, that, technology, has, no, per, se, moral, bent, it, is, a, tool, that, profoundly, shapes, an, individual, s, and, by, extension, a, society, s, self, conception, and, realization, is, it, not, obvious, that, there, are, always, enough, moral, problems, without, also, taking, a, moral, stand, on, technological, grounds, print, is, the, extreme, phase, of, alphabet, culture, that, detribalizes, or, decollectivizes, man, in, the, first, instance, print, raises, the, visual, features, of, alphabet, to, highest, intensity, of, definition, thus, print, carries, the, individuating, power, of, the, phonetic, alphabet, much, further, than, manuscript, culture, could, ever, do, print, is, the, technology, of, individualism, if, men, decided, to, modify, this, visual, technology, by, an, electric, technology, individualism, would, also, be, modified, to, raise, a, moral, complaint, about, this, is, like, cussing, a, buzz, saw, for, lopping, off, fingers, but, someone, says, we, didn, t, know, it, would, happen, yet, even, witlessness, is, not, a, moral, issue, it, is, a, problem, but, not, a, moral, problem, and, it, would, be, nice, to, clear, away, some, of, the, moral, fogs, that, surround, our, technologies, it, would, be, good, for, morality, the, moral, valence, of, technology, s, effects, on, cognition, is, for, mcluhan, a, matter, of, perspective, for, instance, mcluhan, contrasts, the, considerable, alarm, and, revulsion, that, the, growing, quantity, of, books, aroused, in, the, latter, 17th, century, with, the, modern, concern, for, the, end, of, the, book, if, there, can, be, no, universal, moral, sentence, passed, on, technology, mcluhan, believes, that, there, can, only, be, disaster, arising, from, unawareness, of, the, causalities, and, effects, inherent, in, our, technologies, though, the, world, wide, web, was, invented, almost, 30, years, after, the, gutenberg, galaxy, and, 10, years, after, his, death, mcluhan, prophesied, the, web, technology, seen, today, as, early, as, 1962, the, next, medium, whatever, it, is, it, may, be, the, extension, of, consciousness, will, include, television, as, its, content, not, as, its, environment, and, will, transform, television, into, an, art, form, a, computer, as, a, research, and, communication, instrument, could, enhance, retrieval, obsolesce, mass, library, organization, retrieve, the, individual, s, encyclopedic, function, and, flip, into, a, private, line, to, speedily, tailored, data, of, a, saleable, kind, furthermore, mcluhan, coined, and, certainly, popularized, the, usage, of, the, term, surfing, to, refer, to, rapid, irregular, and, multidirectional, movement, through, a, heterogeneous, body, of, documents, or, knowledge, e, g, statements, such, as, heidegger, surf, boards, along, on, the, electronic, wave, as, triumphantly, as, descartes, rode, the, mechanical, wave, paul, levinson, s, 1999, book, digital, mcluhan, explores, the, ways, that, mcluhan, s, work, may, be, understood, better, through, using, the, lens, of, the, digital, revolution, mcluhan, frequently, quoted, walter, ong, s, ramus, method, and, the, decay, of, dialogue, 1958, which, evidently, had, prompted, mcluhan, to, write, the, gutenberg, galaxy, ong, wrote, a, highly, favorable, review, of, this, new, book, in, america, however, ong, later, tempered, his, praise, by, describing, mcluhan, s, the, gutenberg, galaxy, as, a, racy, survey, indifferent, to, some, scholarly, detail, but, uniquely, valuable, in, suggesting, the, sweep, and, depth, of, the, cultural, and, psychological, changes, entailed, in, the, passage, from, illiteracy, to, print, and, beyond, mcluhan, himself, said, of, the, book, i, m, not, concerned, to, get, any, kudos, out, of, it, seems, to, me, a, book, that, somebody, should, have, written, a, century, ago, i, wish, somebody, else, had, written, it, it, will, be, a, useful, prelude, to, the, rewrite, of, understanding, media, that, i, m, doing, now, mcluhan, s, the, gutenberg, galaxy, won, canada, s, highest, literary, award, the, governor, general, s, award, for, non, fiction, in, 1962, the, chairman, of, the, selection, committee, was, mcluhan, s, colleague, at, the, university, of, toronto, and, oftentime, intellectual, sparring, partner, northrop, frye, mcluhan, s, best, known, work, understanding, media, the, extensions, of, man, 1964, is, a, seminal, study, in, media, theory, dismayed, by, the, way, in, which, people, approach, and, use, new, media, such, as, television, mcluhan, famously, argues, that, in, the, modern, world, we, live, mythically, and, integrally, but, continue, to, think, in, the, old, fragmented, space, and, time, patterns, of, the, pre, electric, age, mcluhan, proposes, that, media, themselves, not, the, content, they, carry, should, be, the, focus, of, study, popularly, quoted, as, the, medium, is, the, message, his, insight, is, that, a, medium, affects, the, society, in, which, it, plays, a, role, not, by, the, content, it, delivers, but, by, its, own, characteristics, mcluhan, points, to, the, light, bulb, as, a, clear, demonstration, of, this, a, light, bulb, does, not, have, content, in, the, way, that, a, newspaper, has, articles, or, a, television, has, programs, but, it, is, a, medium, that, has, a, social, effect, that, is, a, light, bulb, enables, people, to, create, spaces, at, night, that, would, otherwise, be, enveloped, by, darkness, he, describes, the, light, bulb, as, a, medium, without, any, content, mcluhan, writes, a, light, bulb, creates, an, environment, by, its, mere, presence, more, controversially, he, postulates, that, content, has, little, effect, on, society, for, example, whether, television, broadcasts, children, s, shows, or, violent, programming, its, effect, on, society, is, identical, he, notes, that, all, media, have, characteristics, that, engage, the, viewer, in, different, ways, for, instance, a, passage, in, a, book, can, be, reread, at, will, but, a, movie, must, be, screened, again, in, its, entirety, to, study, any, part, of, it, in, the, first, part, of, understanding, media, mcluhan, writes, that, different, media, invite, different, degrees, of, participation, on, the, part, of, a, person, who, chooses, to, consume, a, medium, using, terminology, derived, from, french, anthropologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, s, distinction, between, hot, and, cold, societies, mcluhan, argues, that, a, cool, medium, requires, increased, involvement, due, to, decreased, description, while, a, hot, medium, is, the, opposite, decreasing, involvement, and, increasing, description, in, other, words, a, society, that, appears, to, be, actively, participating, in, streaming, content, but, does, not, consider, the, tool, s, effects, is, not, allowing, an, extension, of, ourselves, a, movie, is, thus, said, to, be, high, definition, demanding, a, viewer, s, attention, and, a, comic, book, low, definition, requiring, much, more, conscious, participation, by, the, reader, to, extract, value, any, hot, medium, allows, of, less, participation, than, a, cool, one, as, a, lecture, makes, for, less, participation, than, a, seminar, and, a, book, for, less, than, a, dialogue, some, media, such, as, movies, are, hot, that, is, they, enhance, a, single, sense, in, this, case, vision, in, such, a, manner, that, a, person, does, not, need, to, exert, much, effort, to, perceive, a, detailed, moving, image, hot, media, usually, but, not, always, provide, complete, involvement, with, considerable, stimulus, in, contrast, cool, print, may, also, occupy, visual, space, using, visual, senses, but, require, focus, and, comprehension, to, immerse, readers, hot, media, creation, favour, analytical, precision, quantitative, analysis, and, sequential, ordering, as, they, are, usually, sequential, linear, and, logical, they, emphasize, one, sense, for, example, of, sight, or, sound, over, the, others, for, this, reason, hot, media, include, film, especially, silent, films, radio, the, lecture, and, photography, mcluhan, contrasts, hot, media, with, cool, specifically, television, which, he, claims, requires, more, effort, from, the, viewer, to, determine, meaning, and, comics, which, due, to, their, minimal, presentation, of, visual, detail, require, a, high, degree, of, effort, to, fill, in, details, the, cartoonist, may, have, intended, to, portray, cool, media, are, usually, but, not, always, those, that, provide, little, involvement, with, substantial, stimulus, they, require, more, active, participation, on, the, part, of, the, user, including, the, perception, of, abstract, patterning, and, simultaneous, comprehension, of, all, parts, therefore, in, addition, to, television, cool, media, include, seminars, and, cartoons, mcluhan, describes, the, term, cool, media, as, emerging, from, jazz, and, popular, music, used, in, this, context, to, mean, detached, this, appears, to, force, media, into, binary, categories, but, mcluhan, s, hot, and, cool, exist, on, a, continuum, they, are, more, correctly, measured, on, a, scale, than, as, dichotomous, terms, some, theorists, have, attacked, mcluhan, s, definition, and, treatment, of, the, word, medium, for, being, too, simplistic, umberto, eco, for, instance, contends, that, mcluhan, s, medium, conflates, channels, codes, and, messages, under, the, overarching, term, of, the, medium, confusing, the, vehicle, internal, code, and, content, of, a, given, message, in, his, framework, in, media, manifestos, r, gis, debray, also, takes, issue, with, mcluhan, s, envisioning, of, the, medium, like, eco, he, is, ill, at, ease, with, this, reductionist, approach, summarizing, its, ramifications, as, follows, the, list, of, objections, could, be, and, has, been, lengthened, indefinitely, confusing, technology, itself, with, its, use, of, the, media, makes, of, the, media, an, abstract, undifferentiated, force, and, produces, its, image, in, an, imaginary, public, for, mass, consumption, the, magical, naivete, of, supposed, causalities, turns, the, media, into, a, catch, all, and, contagious, mana, apocalyptic, millenarianism, invents, the, figure, of, a, homo, mass, mediaticus, without, ties, to, historical, and, social, context, and, so, on, furthermore, when, wired, magazine, interviewed, him, in, 1995, debray, said, he, saw, mcluhan, more, as, a, poet, than, a, historian, a, master, of, intellectual, collage, rather, than, a, systematic, analyst, mcluhan, overemphasizes, the, technology, behind, cultural, change, at, the, expense, of, the, usage, that, the, messages, and, codes, make, of, that, technology, dwight, macdonald, in, turn, reproached, mcluhan, for, his, focus, on, television, and, for, his, aphoristic, prose, style, which, he, believes, leaves, understanding, media, filled, with, contradictions, non, sequiturs, facts, that, are, distorted, and, facts, that, are, not, facts, exaggerations, and, chronic, rhetorical, vagueness, brian, winston, s, misunderstanding, media, published, in, 1986, chides, mcluhan, for, what, he, sees, as, his, technologically, deterministic, stances, raymond, williams, furthers, this, point, of, contention, claiming, the, work, of, mcluhan, was, a, particular, culmination, of, an, aesthetic, theory, which, became, negatively, a, social, theory, it, is, an, apparently, sophisticated, technological, determinism, which, has, the, significant, effect, of, indicating, a, social, and, cultural, determinism, for, if, the, medium, whether, print, or, television, is, the, cause, all, other, causes, all, that, men, ordinarily, see, as, history, are, at, once, reduced, to, effects, david, carr, wrote, that, there, has, been, a, long, line, of, academics, who, have, made, a, career, out, of, deconstructing, mcluhan, s, effort, to, define, the, modern, media, ecosystem, whether, it, be, due, to, what, they, see, as, mcluhan, s, ignorance, of, sociohistorical, context, or, the, style, of, his, argument, while, some, critics, have, taken, issue, with, mcluhan, s, writing, style, and, mode, of, argument, mcluhan, himself, urged, readers, to, think, of, his, work, as, probes, or, mosaics, offering, a, toolkit, approach, to, thinking, about, media, his, eclectic, writing, style, has, also, been, praised, for, its, postmodern, sensibilities, and, suitability, for, virtual, space, the, medium, is, the, massage, an, inventory, of, effects, published, in, 1967, was, mcluhan, s, best, seller, eventually, selling, nearly, a, million, copies, worldwide, initiated, by, quentin, fiore, mcluhan, adopted, the, term, massage, to, denote, the, effect, each, medium, has, on, the, human, sensorium, taking, inventory, of, the, effects, of, numerous, media, in, terms, of, how, they, massage, the, sensorium, fiore, at, the, time, a, prominent, graphic, designer, and, communications, consultant, set, about, composing, the, visual, illustration, of, these, effects, which, were, compiled, by, jerome, agel, near, the, beginning, of, the, book, fiore, adopted, a, pattern, in, which, an, image, demonstrating, a, media, effect, was, presented, with, a, textual, synopsis, on, the, facing, page, the, reader, experiences, a, repeated, shifting, of, analytic, registers, from, reading, typographic, print, to, scanning, photographic, facsimiles, reinforcing, mcluhan, s, overarching, argument, in, this, book, namely, that, each, medium, produces, a, different, massage, or, effect, on, the, human, sensorium, in, the, medium, is, the, massage, mcluhan, also, rehashed, the, argument, which, first, appeared, in, the, prologue, to, 1962, s, the, gutenberg, galaxy, that, all, media, are, extensions, of, our, human, senses, bodies, and, minds, finally, mcluhan, described, key, points, of, change, in, how, man, has, viewed, the, world, and, how, these, views, were, changed, by, the, adoption, of, new, media, the, technique, of, invention, was, the, discovery, of, the, nineteenth, brought, on, by, the, adoption, of, fixed, points, of, view, and, perspective, by, typography, while, he, technique, of, the, suspended, judgment, is, the, discovery, of, the, twentieth, century, brought, on, by, the, bard, abilities, of, radio, movies, and, television, the, past, went, that, a, way, when, faced, with, a, totally, new, situation, we, tend, always, to, attach, ourselves, to, the, objects, to, the, flavor, of, the, most, recent, past, we, look, at, the, present, through, a, rear, view, mirror, we, march, backward, into, the, future, suburbia, lives, imaginatively, in, bonanza, land, an, audio, recording, version, of, mcluhan, s, famous, work, was, made, by, columbia, records, the, recording, consists, of, a, pastiche, of, statements, made, by, mcluhan, interrupted, by, other, speakers, including, people, speaking, in, various, phonations, and, falsettos, discordant, sounds, and, 1960s, incidental, music, in, what, could, be, considered, a, deliberate, attempt, to, translate, the, disconnected, images, seen, on, tv, into, an, audio, format, resulting, in, the, prevention, of, a, connected, stream, of, conscious, thought, various, audio, recording, techniques, and, statements, are, used, to, illustrate, the, relationship, between, spoken, literary, speech, and, the, characteristics, of, electronic, audio, media, mcluhan, biographer, philip, marchand, called, the, recording, the, 1967, equivalent, of, a, mcluhan, video, i, wouldn, t, be, seen, dead, with, a, living, work, of, art, old, man, speaking, drop, this, jiggery, pokery, and, talk, straight, turkey, middle, aged, man, speaking, in, war, and, peace, in, the, global, village, mcluhan, used, james, joyce, s, finnegans, wake, an, inspiration, for, this, study, of, war, throughout, history, as, an, indicator, as, to, how, war, may, be, conducted, in, the, future, joyce, s, wake, is, claimed, to, be, a, gigantic, cryptogram, that, reveals, a, cyclic, pattern, for, human, history, through, its, ten, thunders, each, thunder, below, is, a, 100, character, portmanteau, of, other, words, to, create, a, statement, mcluhan, likens, to, an, effect, that, each, technology, has, on, the, society, into, which, it, is, introduced, in, order, to, glean, the, most, understanding, out, of, each, the, reader, must, break, the, portmanteau, into, separate, words, many, of, these, themselves, portmanteaus, of, words, taken, from, multiple, languages, other, than, english, and, speak, them, aloud, for, the, spoken, effect, of, each, word, there, is, much, dispute, over, what, each, portmanteau, truly, denotes, mcluhan, claims, that, the, ten, thunders, in, wake, represent, different, stages, in, the, history, of, man, collaborating, with, canadian, poet, wilfred, watson, in, from, clich, to, archetype, 1970, mcluhan, approaches, the, various, implications, of, the, verbal, clich, and, of, the, archetype, one, major, facet, in, mcluhan, s, overall, framework, introduced, in, this, book, that, is, seldom, noticed, is, the, provision, of, a, new, term, that, actually, succeeds, the, global, village, the, global, theater, in, mcluhan, s, terms, a, clich, is, a, normal, action, phrase, etc, which, becomes, so, often, used, that, we, are, anesthetized, to, its, effects, mcluhan, provides, the, example, of, eug, ne, ionesco, s, play, the, bald, soprano, whose, dialogue, consists, entirely, of, phrases, ionesco, pulled, from, an, assimil, language, book, ionesco, originally, put, all, these, idiomatic, english, clich, s, into, literary, french, which, presented, the, english, in, the, most, absurd, aspect, possible, mcluhan, s, archetype, is, a, quoted, extension, medium, technology, or, environment, environment, would, also, include, the, kinds, of, awareness, and, cognitive, shifts, brought, upon, people, by, it, not, totally, unlike, the, psychological, context, carl, jung, described, mcluhan, also, posits, that, there, is, a, factor, of, interplay, between, the, clich, and, the, archetype, or, a, doubleness, another, theme, of, the, wake, that, helps, in, the, understanding, of, the, paradoxical, shift, from, clich, to, archetype, is, past, time, are, pastimes, the, dominant, technologies, of, one, age, become, the, games, and, pastimes, of, a, later, age, in, the, 20th, century, the, number, of, past, times, that, are, simultaneously, available, is, so, vast, as, to, create, cultural, anarchy, when, all, the, cultures, of, the, world, are, simultaneously, present, the, work, of, the, artist, in, the, elucidation, of, form, takes, on, new, scope, and, new, urgency, most, men, are, pushed, into, the, artist, s, role, the, artist, cannot, dispense, with, the, principle, of, doubleness, or, interplay, because, this, type, of, hendiadys, dialogue, is, essential, to, the, very, structure, of, consciousness, awareness, and, autonomy, mcluhan, relates, the, clich, to, archetype, process, to, the, theater, of, the, absurd, pascal, in, the, seventeenth, century, tells, us, that, the, heart, has, many, reasons, of, which, the, head, knows, nothing, the, theater, of, the, absurd, is, essentially, a, communicating, to, the, head, of, some, of, the, silent, languages, of, the, heart, which, in, two, or, three, hundred, years, it, has, tried, to, forget, all, about, in, the, seventeenth, century, world, the, languages, of, the, heart, were, pushed, down, into, the, unconscious, by, the, dominant, print, clich, the, languages, of, the, heart, or, what, mcluhan, otherwise, defined, as, oral, culture, were, thus, made, archetype, by, means, of, the, printing, press, and, turned, into, clich, according, to, mcluhan, the, satellite, medium, encloses, the, earth, in, a, man, made, environment, which, ends, nature, and, turns, the, globe, into, a, repertory, theater, to, be, programmed, all, previous, environments, book, newspaper, radio, etc, and, their, artifacts, are, retrieved, under, these, conditions, past, times, are, pastimes, mcluhan, thereby, meshes, this, into, the, term, global, theater, this, updates, his, concept, of, the, global, village, which, in, its, own, definitions, can, be, said, to, be, subsumed, into, the, overall, condition, of, the, global, theater, in, his, posthumous, book, the, global, village, transformations, in, world, life, and, media, in, the, 21st, century, 1989, mcluhan, collaborating, with, bruce, r, powers, provides, a, strong, conceptual, framework, for, understanding, the, cultural, implications, of, the, technological, advances, associated, with, the, rise, of, a, worldwide, electronic, network, this, is, a, major, work, of, mcluhan, s, as, it, contains, the, most, extensive, elaboration, of, his, concept, of, acoustic, space, and, provides, a, critique, of, standard, 20th, century, communication, models, such, as, the, shannon, weaver, model, mcluhan, distinguishes, between, the, existing, worldview, of, visual, space, a, linear, quantitative, classically, geometric, model, and, that, of, acoustic, space, a, holistic, qualitative, order, with, an, intricate, paradoxical, topology, acoustic, space, has, the, basic, character, of, a, sphere, whose, focus, or, center, is, simultaneously, everywhere, and, whose, margin, is, nowhere, the, transition, from, visual, to, acoustic, space, was, not, automatic, with, the, advent, of, the, global, network, but, would, have, to, be, a, conscious, project, the, universal, environment, of, simultaneous, electronic, flow, inherently, favors, right, brain, acoustic, space, yet, we, are, held, back, by, habits, of, adhering, to, a, fixed, point, of, view, there, are, no, boundaries, to, sound, we, hear, from, all, directions, at, once, yet, acoustic, and, visual, space, are, inseparable, the, resonant, interval, is, the, invisible, borderline, between, visual, and, acoustic, space, this, is, like, the, television, camera, that, the, apollo, 8, astronauts, focused, on, the, earth, after, they, had, orbited, the, moon, mcluhan, illustrates, how, it, feels, to, exist, within, acoustic, space, by, quoting, from, the, autobiography, of, jacques, lusseyran, and, there, was, light, lusseyran, lost, his, eyesight, in, a, violent, accident, as, a, child, and, the, autobiography, describes, how, a, reordering, of, his, sensory, life, and, perception, followed, when, i, came, upon, the, myth, of, objectivity, in, certain, modern, thinkers, it, made, me, angry, so, there, was, only, one, world, for, these, people, the, same, for, everyone, and, all, the, other, worlds, were, to, be, counted, as, illusions, left, over, from, the, past, or, why, not, call, them, by, their, name, hallucinations, i, had, learned, to, my, cost, how, wrong, they, were, from, my, own, experience, i, knew, very, well, that, it, was, enough, to, take, from, a, man, a, memory, here, an, association, there, to, deprive, him, of, hearing, or, sight, for, the, world, to, undergo, immediate, transformation, and, for, another, world, entirely, different, but, entirely, coherent, to, be, born, another, world, not, really, the, same, world, rather, but, seen, from, a, different, angle, and, counted, in, entirely, new, measures, when, this, happened, all, the, hierarchies, they, called, objective, were, turned, upside, down, scattered, to, the, four, winds, not, even, theories, but, like, whims, reading, writing, and, hierarchical, ordering, are, associated, with, the, left, brain, and, visual, space, as, are, the, linear, concept, of, time, and, phonetic, literacy, the, left, brain, is, the, locus, of, analysis, classification, and, rationality, the, right, brain, and, acoustic, space, are, the, locus, of, the, spatial, tactile, and, musical, comprehensive, awareness, results, when, the, two, sides, of, the, brain, are, in, true, balance, visual, space, is, associated, with, the, simplified, worldview, of, euclidean, geometry, the, intuitive, three, dimensions, useful, for, the, architecture, of, buildings, and, the, surveying, of, land, it, is, linearly, rational, and, has, no, grasp, of, the, acoustic, acoustic, space, is, multisensory, mcluhan, writes, about, robotism, in, the, context, of, japanese, zen, buddhism, and, how, it, can, offer, us, new, ways, of, thinking, about, technology, the, western, way, of, thinking, about, technology, is, too, related, to, the, left, brain, which, has, a, rational, and, linear, focus, what, he, called, robotism, might, better, be, called, androidism, in, the, wake, of, blade, runner, and, the, novels, of, philip, k, dick, robotism, androidism, emerges, from, the, further, development, of, the, right, brain, creativity, and, a, new, relationship, to, spacetime, most, humans, are, still, living, in, 17th, century, classical, newtonian, physics, spacetime, robots, androids, will, have, much, greater, flexibility, than, humans, have, had, until, now, in, both, mind, and, body, robots, androids, will, teach, humanity, this, new, flexibility, and, this, flexibility, of, androids, what, mcluhan, calls, robotism, has, a, strong, affinity, with, japanese, culture, and, life, mcluhan, quotes, from, ruth, benedict, s, the, chrysanthemum, and, the, sword, an, anthropological, study, of, japanese, culture, published, in, 1946, occidentals, cannot, easily, credit, the, ability, of, the, japanese, to, swing, from, one, behavior, to, another, without, psychic, cost, such, extreme, possibilities, are, not, included, in, our, experience, yet, in, japanese, life, the, contradictions, as, they, seem, to, us, are, as, deeply, based, in, their, view, of, life, as, our, uniformities, are, in, ours, the, ability, to, live, in, the, present, and, instantly, readjust, all, western, scientific, models, of, communication, are, like, the, shannon, weaver, model, linear, sequential, and, logical, as, a, reflection, of, the, late, medieval, emphasis, on, the, greek, notion, of, efficient, causality, mcluhan, and, powers, criticize, the, shannon, weaver, model, of, communication, as, emblematic, of, left, hemisphere, bias, and, linearity, descended, from, a, print, era, perversion, of, aristotle, s, notion, of, efficient, causality, a, third, term, of, the, global, village, that, mcluhan, and, powers, develop, at, length, is, the, tetrad, mcluhan, had, begun, development, on, the, tetrad, as, early, as, 1974, the, tetrad, is, an, analogical, simultaneous, fourfold, pattern, of, transformation, at, full, maturity, the, tetrad, reveals, the, metaphoric, structure, of, the, artifact, as, having, two, figures, and, two, grounds, in, dynamic, and, analogical, relationship, to, each, other, like, the, camera, focused, on, the, earth, by, the, apollo, 8, astronauts, the, tetrad, reveals, figure, moon, and, ground, earth, simultaneously, the, right, brain, hemisphere, thinking, is, the, capability, of, being, in, many, places, at, the, same, time, electricity, is, acoustic, it, is, simultaneously, everywhere, the, tetrad, with, its, fourfold, m, bius, topological, structure, of, enhancement, reversal, retrieval, and, obsolescence, is, mobilized, by, mcluhan, and, powers, to, illuminate, the, media, or, technological, inventions, of, cash, money, the, compass, the, computer, the, database, the, satellite, and, the, global, media, network, in, laws, of, media, 1988, published, posthumously, by, his, son, eric, mcluhan, summarized, his, ideas, about, media, in, a, concise, tetrad, of, media, effects, the, tetrad, is, a, means, of, examining, the, effects, on, society, of, any, technology, i, e, any, medium, by, dividing, its, effects, into, four, categories, and, displaying, them, simultaneously, mcluhan, designed, the, tetrad, as, a, pedagogical, tool, phrasing, his, laws, as, questions, with, which, to, consider, any, medium, the, laws, of, the, tetrad, exist, simultaneously, not, successively, or, chronologically, and, allow, the, questioner, to, explore, the, grammar, and, syntax, of, the, language, of, media, mcluhan, departs, from, his, mentor, harold, innis, in, suggesting, that, a, medium, overheats, or, reverses, into, an, opposing, form, when, taken, to, its, extreme, visually, a, tetrad, can, be, depicted, as, four, diamonds, forming, an, x, with, the, name, of, a, medium, in, the, centre, the, two, diamonds, on, the, left, of, a, tetrad, are, the, enhancement, and, retrieval, qualities, of, the, medium, both, figure, qualities, the, two, diamonds, on, the, right, of, a, tetrad, are, the, obsolescence, and, reversal, qualities, both, ground, qualities, using, the, example, of, radio, mcluhan, adapted, the, gestalt, psychology, idea, of, a, figure, and, a, ground, which, underpins, the, meaning, of, the, medium, is, the, message, he, used, this, concept, to, explain, how, a, form, of, communications, technology, the, medium, or, figure, necessarily, operates, through, its, context, or, ground, mcluhan, believed, that, in, order, to, grasp, fully, the, effect, of, a, new, technology, one, must, examine, figure, medium, and, ground, context, together, since, neither, is, completely, intelligible, without, the, other, mcluhan, argued, that, we, must, study, media, in, their, historical, context, particularly, in, relation, to, the, technologies, that, preceded, them, the, present, environment, itself, made, up, of, the, effects, of, previous, technologies, gives, rise, to, new, technologies, which, in, their, turn, further, affect, society, and, individuals, all, technologies, have, embedded, within, them, their, own, assumptions, about, time, and, space, the, message, which, the, medium, conveys, can, only, be, understood, if, the, medium, and, the, environment, in, which, the, medium, is, used, and, which, simultaneously, it, effectively, creates, are, analysed, together, he, believed, that, an, examination, of, the, figure, ground, relationship, can, offer, a, critical, commentary, on, culture, and, society, in, mcluhan, s, and, harley, parker, s, work, electric, media, have, an, affinity, with, haptic, and, hearing, perception, while, mechanical, media, have, an, affinity, with, visual, perception, this, opposition, between, optic, and, haptic, had, previously, been, formulated, by, art, historians, alois, riegl, in, his, 1901, late, roman, art, industry, and, by, erwin, panofsky, in, his, 1927, perspective, as, symbolic, form, in, his, the, work, of, art, in, the, age, of, mechanical, reproduction, 1935, walter, benjamin, observed, how, in, perceptions, of, modern, western, culture, from, about, the, 19th, century, a, shift, began, from, the, optic, toward, the, haptic, this, shift, is, one, of, the, main, recurring, topics, in, mcluhan, s, work, which, mcluhan, attributes, to, the, advent, of, the, electronic, era, after, the, publication, of, understanding, media, mcluhan, received, an, astonishing, amount, of, publicity, making, him, perhaps, the, most, publicized, 20th, century, english, teacher, and, arguably, the, most, controversial, this, publicity, began, with, the, work, of, two, california, advertising, executives, howard, gossage, and, gerald, feigen, who, used, personal, funds, to, fund, their, practice, of, genius, scouting, much, enamoured, of, mcluhan, s, work, feigen, and, gossage, arranged, for, mcluhan, to, meet, with, editors, of, several, major, new, york, magazines, in, may, 1965, at, the, lombardy, hotel, in, new, york, philip, marchand, reports, that, as, a, direct, consequence, of, these, meetings, mcluhan, was, offered, the, use, of, an, office, in, the, headquarters, of, both, time, and, newsweek, anytime, he, wanted, it, in, august, 1965, feigen, and, gossage, held, what, they, called, a, mcluhan, festival, in, the, offices, of, gossage, s, advertising, agency, in, san,

significant, was, the, presence, at, the, festival, of, tom, wolfe, who, wrote, about, mcluhan, in, a, subsequent, article, what, if, he, is, right, published, in, new, york, magazine, and, wolfe, s, own, the, pump, house, gang, according, to, feigen, and, gossage, their, work, had, only, a, moderate, effect, on, mcluhan, s, eventual, celebrity, they, claimed, that, their, work, only, probably, speeded, up, the, recognition, of, his, genius, by, about, six, months, in, any, case, mcluhan, soon, became, a, fixture, of, media, discourse, newsweek, magazine, did, a, cover, story, on, him,

him, by, mcluhan, during, a, lunch, in, new, york, city, leary, said, mcluhan, was, very, much, interested, in, ideas, and, marketing, and, he, started, singing, something, like, psychedelics, hit, the, spot, five, hundred, micrograms, that, s, a, lot, to, the, tune, of, a, pepsi, commercial, then, he, started, going, tune, in, turn, on, and, drop, out, during, his, lifetime, and, afterward, mcluhan, heavily, influenced, cultural, critics, thinkers, and, media, theorists, such, as, neil, postman, jean, baudrillard, timothy, leary, terence, mckenna, william, irwin, thompson, paul, levinson, douglas, rushkoff, jaron, lanier, hugh, kenner, and, john, david, ebert, as, well, as, political, leaders, such, as, pierre, elliott, trudeau, and, jerry, brown, andy, warhol, was,

language, to, recycle, and, revitalize, it, but, the, new, title, is, more, than, mcluhan, indulging, his, insatiable, taste, for, puns, more, than, a, clever, fusion, of, self, mockery, and, self,
