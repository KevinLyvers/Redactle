experienced, periods, of, sudden, illness, those, who, knew, the, family, described, her, as, suddenly, falling, to, the, floor, writhing, and, screaming, or, silent, and, apparently, unconscious, sometimes, for, hours, historian, robert, peel, wrote, that, these, fits, would, require, the, family, to, send, eddy, to, the, village, doctor, the, cause, for, eddy, s, illness, was, unclear, but, biographer, caroline, fraser, wrote, she, believed, the, cause, was, most, likely, psychogenic, in, nature, according, to, psychoanalyst, julius, silberger, eddy, may, have, been, motivated, to, have, these, fits, in, an, effort, to, control, her, father, s, attitude, toward, her, fraser, attributed, the, illness, likely, to, a, combination, of, hypochondria, and, histrionics, as, well, in, 1836, when, eddy, was, about, 14, to, 15, years, old, she, moved, with, her, family, to, the, town, of, sanbornton, bridge, new, hampshire, approximately, twenty, miles, 32, km, north, of, bow, sanbornton,

received, private, tuition, from, the, reverend, enoch, corser, she, entered, sanbornton, academy, in, 1842, she, was, received, into, the, congregational, church, in, tilton, on, july, 26, 1838, when, she, was, 17, according, to, church, records, published, by, cather, and, milmine, eddy, had, written, in, her, autobiography, in, 1891, that, she, was, 12, when, this, happened, and, that, she, had, discussed, the, idea, of, predestination, with, the, pastor, during, the, examination, for, her, membership, this, may, have, been, an, attempt, to, mirror, the, story, of, a, 12, year, old, jesus, in, the, temple, eddy, was, badly, affected, by, four, deaths, in, the, 1840s, she, regarded, her, brother, albert, as, a, teacher, and, mentor, but, he, died, in, 1841, in, 1844, her, first, husband, george, washington, glover, a, friend, of, her, brother, samuel, died, after, six, months, of, marriage, they, had, married, in, december, 1843, and, set, up, home, in, charleston, south, carolina, where, glover, had, business, but, he, died, of, yellow, fever, in, june, 1844, while, living, in, wilmington, north, carolina, eddy, was, with, him, in, wilmington, six, months, pregnant, she, had, to, make, her, way, back, to, new, hampshire, 1, 400, miles, 2, 300, km, by, train, and, steamboat, where, her, only, child, george, washington, glover, ii, was, born, on, september, 12, in, her, father, s, home, her, husband, s, death, the, journey, back, and, the, birth, left, her, physically, and, mentally, exhausted, and, she, ended, up, bedridden, for, months, as, eddy, was, unable, to, care, for, him, her, son, was, nursed, by, a, local, woman, while, eddy, herself, was, cared, for, by, a, household, servant, eddy, s, mother, died, in, november, 1849, her, mother, s, death, was, then, followed, three, weeks, later, by, the, death, of, eddy, s, fianc, lawyer, john, bartlett, eddy, s, father, mark, baker, remarried, in, 1850, his, second, wife, elizabeth, patterson, duncan, d, june, 6, 1875, had, been, widowed, twice, and, had, some, property, and, income, from, her, second, marriage, baker, apparently, made, clear, to, eddy, that, her, son, would, not, be, welcome, in, the, new, marital, home, eddy, married, dr, daniel, patterson, a, dentist, in, 1853, mesmerism, had, become, popular, in, new, england, and, on, october, 14, 1861, patterson, wrote, to, mesmerist, phineas, parkhurst, quimby, who, reportedly, cured, people, without, medicine, asking, if, he, could, cure, his, wife, quimby, replied, that, he, had, too, much, work, in, portland, maine, and, that, he, could, not, visit, her, but, if, patterson, brought, his, wife, to, him, he, would, treat, her, eddy, did, not, immediately, go, instead, trying, the, water, cure, at, dr, vail, s, hydropathic, institute, but, her, health, deteriorated, even, further, a, year, later, in, october, 1862, eddy, first, visited, quimby, she, improved, considerably, and, publicly, declared, that, she, had, been, able, to, walk, up, 182, steps, to, the, dome, of, city, hall, after, a, week, of, treatment, the, cures, were, temporary, however, and, eddy, suffered, relapses, despite, the, temporary, nature, of, the, cure, she, attached, religious, significance, to, it, which, quimby, did, not, she, believed, that, it, was, the, same, type, of, healing, that, christ, jesus, had, performed, from, 1862, to, 1865, quimby, and, eddy, engaged, in, lengthy, discussions, about, healing, methods, practiced, by, quimby, and, others, she, took, notes, on, her, own, ideas, on, healing, as, well, as, writing, dictations, from, him, and, correcting, them, with, her, own, ideas, some, of, which, possibly, ended, up, in, the, quimby, manuscripts, that, were, published, later, and, attributed, to, him, despite, quimby, not, being, especially, religious, he, embraced, the, religious, connotations, eddy, was, bringing, to, his, work, since, he, knew, his, more, religious, patients, would, appreciate, it, phineas, quimby, died, on, january, 16, 1866, shortly, after, eddy, s, father, j, gordon, melton, has, argued, certainly, eddy, shared, some, ideas, with, quimby, she, differed, with, him, in, some, key, areas, however, such, as, specific, healing, techniques, moreover, she, did, not, share, quimby, s, hostility, toward, the, bible, and, christianity, biographer, gillian, gill, has, disagreed, with, other, scholars, arguing, they, have, flouted, the, evidence, and, shown, willful, bias, in, accusing, mrs, eddy, of, owing, her, theory, of, healing, to, quimby, and, of, plagiarizing, his, unpublished, work, on, february, 1, 1866, while, living, in, lynn, massachusetts, eddy, slipped, and, fell, on, a, patch, of, ice, a, contemporary, account, by, the, lynn, reporter, stated, mrs, mary, patterson, of, swampscott, fell, upon, the, ice, near, the, corner, of, market, and, oxford, streets, on, thursday, evening, and, was, severely, injured, she, was, taken, up, in, an, insensible, condition, and, carried, into, the, residence, of, s, m, bubier, esq, near, by, where, she, was, kindly, cared, for, during, the, night, dr, cushing, who, was, called, found, her, injuries, to, be, internal, and, of, a, severe, nature, inducing, spasms, and, internal, suffering, she, was, removed, to, her, home, in, swampscott, yesterday, afternoon, though, in, a, very, critical, condition, when, georgine, milmine, interviewed, dr, cushing, forty, years, later, he, stated, that, his, records, from, the, time, documented, that, eddy, was, in, a, semi, hysterical, intense, emotional, state, which, subsided, after, she, was, given, a, small, amount, of, morphine, on, february, 14, 1866, the, day, after, eddy, finished, her, care, with, dr, cushing, eddy, wrote, to, julius, dresser, another, patient, of, phineas, quimby, claiming, that, her, injury, and, her, subsequent, medical, care, had, undone, all, of, the, healing, that, quimby, had, done, before, and, requested, that, he, heal, her, dresser, refused, stating, that, he, was, not, enough, to, take, on, the, burden, of, healing, and, urged, eddy, to, instead, spread, quimby, s, teachings, further, eddy, would, later, credit, her, fall, as, her, moment, of, spiritual, revelation, claiming, that, after, rejecting, the, medicines, offered, to, her, by, her, doctor, she, opened, her, bible, three, days, after, her, fall, and, returned, to, full, health, after, reading, of, jesus, healing, the, sick, eddy, separated, from, her, second, husband, daniel, patterson, in, 1866, after, which, she, boarded, for, four, years, with, several, families, in, lynn, massachusetts, and, elsewhere, frank, podmore, wrote, but, she, was, never, able, to, stay, long, in, one, family, she, quarrelled, successively, with, all, her, hostesses, and, her, departure, from, the, house, was, heralded, on, two, or, three, occasions, by, a, violent, scene, her, friends, during, these, years, were, generally, spiritualists, she, seems, to, have, professed, herself, a, spiritualist, and, to, have, taken, part, in, s, ances, she, was, occasionally, entranced, and, had, received, spirit, communications, from, her, deceased, brother, albert, her, first, advertisement, as, a, healer, appeared, in, 1868, in, the, spiritualist, paper, the, banner, of, light, during, these, years, she, carried, about, with, her, a, copy, of, one, of, quimby, s, manuscripts, giving, an, abstract, of, his, philosophy, this, manuscript, she, permitted, some, of, her, pupils, to, copy, according, to, peel, spiritualists, were, eager, to, claim, her, as, one, of, their, own, after, she, became, well, known, reports, surfaced, that, eddy, had, been, a, medium, years, earlier, in, boston, and, st, louis, however, at, the, time, when, she, was, said, to, be, a, medium, there, she, lived, some, distance, away, in, north, groton, where, she, was, bedridden, according, to, gill, eddy, knew, spiritualists, and, took, part, in, some, of, their, activities, but, was, never, a, convinced, believer, for, example, she, visited, her, friend, sarah, crosby, in, 1864, who, believed, in, spiritualism, according, to, sibyl, wilbur, eddy, attempted, to, show, crosby, the, folly, of, it, by, pretending, to, channel, eddy, s, dead, brother, albert, and, writing, letters, which, she, attributed, to, him, in, regard, to, the, deception, biographer, hugh, evelyn, wortham, stated, mrs, eddy, s, followers, explain, it, all, as, a, pleasantry, on, her, part, to, cure, mrs, crosby, of, her, credulous, belief, in, spiritualism, however, martin, gardner, has, argued, against, this, stating, that, eddy, was, working, as, a, spiritualist, medium, and, was, convinced, by, the, messages, according, to, gardner, eddy, s, mediumship, converted, crosby, to, spiritualism, in, one, of, her, spiritualist, trances, to, crosby, eddy, gave, a, message, that, was, supportive, of, phineas, parkhurst, quimby, stating, p, quimby, of, portland, has, the, spiritual, truth, of, diseases, you, must, imbibe, it, to, be, healed, go, to, him, again, and, lean, on, no, material, or, spiritual, medium, the, paragraph, that, included, this, quote, was, later, omitted, from, an, official, sanctioned, biography, of, eddy, between, 1866, and, 1870, eddy, boarded, at, the, home, of, brene, paine, clark, who, was, interested, in, spiritualism, seances, were, often, conducted, there, but, eddy, and, clark, engaged, in, vigorous, good, natured, arguments, about, them, eddy, s, arguments, against, spiritualism, convinced, at, least, one, other, who, was, there, at, the, time, hiram, crafts, that, her, science, was, far, superior, to, spirit, teachings, clark, s, son, george, tried, to, convince, eddy, to, take, up, spiritualism, but, he, said, that, she, abhorred, the, idea, according, to, cather, and, milmine, richard, hazeltine, attended, seances, at, clark, s, home, and, eddy, had, acted, as, a, trance, medium, claiming, to, channel, the, spirits, of, the, apostles, mary, gould, a, spiritualist, from, lynn, claimed, that, one, of, the, spirits, that, eddy, channeled, was, abraham, lincoln, according, to, eyewitness, reports, cited, by, cather, and, milmine, eddy, was, still, attending, s, ances, as, late, as, 1872, in, these, later, s, ances, eddy, would, attempt, to, convert, her, audience, into, accepting, christian, science, eddy, showed, extensive, familiarity, with, spiritualist, practice, but, she, denounced, it, in, later, christian, science, writings, historian, ann, braude, wrote, that, there, were, similarities, between, spiritualism, and, christian, science, but, the, main, difference, was, that, eddy, came, to, believe, after, she, founded, christian, science, that, spirit, manifestations, had, never, really, had, bodies, to, begin, with, because, matter, is, unreal, and, that, all, that, really, exists, is, spirit, before, and, after, death, in, the, fiftieth, edition, of, her, book, science, and, health, with, key, to, the, scriptures, published, in, 1891, eddy, added, the, chapter, christian, science, and, spiritualism, this, chapter, was, renamed, in, 1910, to, christian, science, versus, spiritualism, eddy, divorced, daniel, patterson, for, adultery, in, 1873, she, published, her, work, in, 1875, in, a, book, entitled, science, and, health, years, later, retitled, science, and, health, with, key, to, the, scriptures, which, she, called, the, textbook, of, christian, science, after, several, years, of, offering, her, healing, method, the, first, publication, run, was, 1, 000, copies, which, she, self, published, during, these, years, she, taught, what, she, considered, the, science, of, primitive, christianity, to, at, least, 800, people, many, of, her, students, became, healers, themselves, the, last, 100, pages, of, science, and, health, chapter, entitled, fruitage, contains, testimonies, of, people, who, claimed, to, have, been, healed, by, reading, her, book, she, made, numerous, revisions, to, her, book, from, the, time, of, its, first, publication, until, shortly, before, her, death, in, january, 1877, eddy, spurned, an, approach, from, one, of, her, students, daniel, spofford, she, then, married, another, student, of, hers, asa, gilbert, eddy, on, january, 1, 1877, the, two, were, wed, and, she, became, mary, baker, eddy, in, a, small, ceremony, presided, over, by, a, unitarian, minister, in, 1881, mary, baker, eddy, started, the, massachusetts, metaphysical, college, with, a, charter, from, the, state, which, allowed, her, to, grant, degrees, in, spring, 1882, the, eddys, moved, to, boston, to, massachusetts, metaphysical, college, gilbert, eddy, s, health, began, to, decline, around, this, time, and, he, died, june, 3, that, year, eddy, devoted, the, rest, of, her, life, to, the, establishment, of, the, church, writing, its, bylaws, the, manual, of, the, mother, church, and, revising, science, and, health, by, the, 1870s, she, was, telling, her, students, some, day, i, will, have, a, church, of, my, own, in, 1879, she, and, her, students, established, the, church, of, christ, scientist, to, commemorate, the, word, and, works, of, our, master, which, should, reinstate, primitive, christianity, and, its, lost, element, of, healing, in, 1881, she, founded, the, massachusetts, metaphysical, college, where, she, taught, approximately, 800, students, between, the, years, 1882, and, 1889, when, she, closed, it, eddy, charged, her, students, 300, each, for, tuition, a, large, sum, for, the, time, in, 1892, at, eddy, s, direction, the, church, reorganized, as, the, first, church, of, christ, scientist, in, 1894, an, edifice, for, the, first, church, of, christ, scientist, was, completed, in, boston, her, students, spread, across, the, country, practicing, healing, and, instructing, others, eddy, authorized, these, students, to, list, themselves, as, christian, science, practitioners, in, the, church, s, the, christian, science, journal, she, also, founded, the, christian, science, sentinel, a, weekly, magazine, with, articles, about, how, to, heal, and, testimonies, of, healing, when, the, church, re, organized, in, 1892, eddy, was, made, the, leader, of, the, church, as, pastor, emeritus, in, 1895, she, ordained, the, bible, and, science, and, health, as, the, pastor, eddy, founded, the, christian, science, publishing, society, in, 1898, which, became, the, publishing, home, for, numerous, publications, launched, by, her, and, her, followers, in, 1908, at, the, age, of, 87, she, founded, the, christian, science, monitor, a, daily, newspaper, she, also, founded, the, christian, science, journal, in, 1883, a, monthly, magazine, aimed, at, the, church, s, members, and, in, 1898, the, christian, science, sentinel, a, weekly, religious, periodical, written, for, a, more, general, audience, and, the, herald, of, christian, science, a, religious, magazine, with, editions, in, many, languages, the, opposite, of, christian, science, mental, healing, was, the, use, of, mental, powers, for, destructive, or, selfish, reasons, for, which, eddy, used, terms, such, as, animal, magnetism, hypnotism, or, mesmerism, interchangeably, malicious, animal, magnetism, sometimes, abbreviated, as, m, a, m, is, what, catherine, albanese, called, a, calvinist, devil, lurking, beneath, the, metaphysical, surface, as, there, is, no, personal, devil, or, evil, in, christian, science, m, a, m, or, mesmerism, became, the, explanation, for, the, problem, of, evil, eddy, was, concerned, that, a, new, practitioner, could, inadvertently, harm, a, patient, through, unenlightened, use, of, their, mental, powers, and, that, less, scrupulous, individuals, could, use, them, as, a, weapon, animal, magnetism, became, one, of, the, most, controversial, aspects, of, eddy, s, life, the, mcclure, s, biography, spends, a, significant, amount, of, time, on, malicious, animal, magnetism, which, it, uses, to, make, the, case, that, eddy, had, paranoia, during, the, next, friends, lawsuit, it, was, used, to, charge, eddy, with, incompetence, and, general, insanity, according, to, gillian, gill, eddy, s, experience, with, richard, kennedy, one, of, her, early, students, was, what, led, her, to, began, her, examination, of, malicious, animal, magnetism, eddy, had, agreed, to, form, a, partnership, with, kennedy, in, 1870, in, which, she, would, teach, him, how, to, heal, and, he, would, take, patients, the, partnership, was, rather, successful, at, first, but, by, 1872, kennedy, had, fallen, out, with, his, teacher, and, torn, up, their, contract, although, there, were, multiple, issues, raised, the, main, reason, for, the, break, according, to, gill, was, eddy, s, insistence, that, kennedy, stop, rubbing, his, patient, s, head, and, solar, plexus, which, she, saw, as, harmful, since, as, gill, states, traditionally, in, mesmerism, or, hypnosis, the, head, and, abdomen, were, manipulated, so, that, the, subject, would, be, prepared, to, enter, into, trance, kennedy, clearly, did, believe, in, clairvoyance, mind, reading, and, absent, mesmeric, treatment, and, after, their, split, eddy, believed, that, kennedy, was, using, his, mesmeric, abilities, to, try, to, harm, her, and, her, movement, in, 1882, eddy, publicly, claimed, that, her, last, husband, asa, gilbert, eddy, had, died, of, mental, assassination, daniel, spofford, was, another, christian, scientist, expelled, by, eddy, after, she, accused, him, of, practicing, malicious, animal, magnetism, this, gained, notoriety, in, a, case, irreverently, dubbed, the, second, salem, witch, trial, later, eddy, set, up, watches, for, her, staff, to, pray, about, challenges, facing, the, christian, science, movement, and, to, handle, animal, magnetism, which, arose, gill, writes, that, eddy, got, the, term, from, the, new, testament, account, of, the, garden, of, gethsemane, where, jesus, chastises, his, disciples, for, being, unable, to, watch, even, for, a, short, time, and, that, eddy, used, it, to, refer, to, a, particularly, vigilant, and, active, form, of, prayer, a, set, period, of, time, when, specific, people, would, put, their, thoughts, toward, god, review, questions, and, problems, of, the, day, and, seek, spiritual, understanding, critics, such, as, georgine, milmine, in, mclure, s, edwin, dakin, and, john, dittemore, all, claimed, this, was, evidence, that, eddy, had, a, great, fear, of, malicious, animal, magnetism, although, gilbert, carpenter, one, of, eddy, s, staff, at, the, time, insisted, she, was, not, fearful, of, it, and, that, she, was, simply, being, vigilant, as, time, went, on, eddy, tried, to, lessen, the, focus, on, animal, magnetism, within, the, movement, and, she, worked, to, clearly, define, it, as, unreality, which, only, had, power, if, one, conceded, to, it, though, it, continued, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, teaching, of, christian, science, the, belief, in, malicious, animal, magnetism, remains, a, part, of, christian, science, doctrine, christian, scientists, use, it, as, a, specific, term, for, a, hypnotic, belief, in, a, power, apart, from, god, scholars, debate, the, influence, of, hinduism, on, eddy, and, her, work, the, 1930, work, hinduism, invades, america, argues, eddy, referenced, the, bhagavad, gita, in, the, 33rd, edition, of, science, and, health, gillian, gill, argued, that, that, her, editor, reverend, james, henry, wiggin, had, introduced, the, references, and, eddy, removed, from, the, 1891, revision, all, the, references, to, eastern, religions, christian, scientist, church, member, and, historian, stephen, gottschalk, argued, that, eddy, consciously, distinguished, christian, science, from, eastern, religions, starting, in, the, mid, 1880s, damodar, singhal, noted, that, whether, or, not, eddy, was, directly, influenced, by, hindu, philosophy, the, echoes, of, vedanta, in, literature, are, often, striking, eddy, was, introduced, to, british, israelism, by, julia, field, king, who, herself, was, introduced, by, the, writings, of, c, a, l, totten, totten, alleged, to, have, traced, queen, victoria, s, genealogy, to, king, david, and, field, king, offered, to, create, a, genealogy, tracing, eddy, to, king, david, eddy, eventually, requested, field, king, cease, work, on, the, genealogy, and, transferred, her, to, london, to, work, on, expanding, the, church, there, since, her, death, academics, have, debated, the, extent, of, eddy, s, relationship, with, british, israelism, with, christian, scientist, historian, robert, peel, arguing, she, was, intrigued, by, the, theory, for,
