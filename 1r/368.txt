as, 1857, he, devoted, much, of, his, time, to, an, ongoing, project, les, deux, cloportes, the, two, woodlice, which, later, became, bouvard, et, p, cuchet, breaking, the, obsessive, project, only, to, write, the, three, tales, in, 1877, this, book, comprises, three, stories, un, c, ur, simple, a, simple, heart, la, l, gende, de, saint, julien, l, hospitalier, the, legend, of, st, julian, the, hospitaller, and, h, rodias, herodias, after, the, publication, of, the, stories, he, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, toiling, on, the, unfinished, bouvard, et, p, cuchet, which, was, posthumously, printed, in, 1881, it, was, a, grand, satire, on, the, futility, of, human, knowledge, and, the, ubiquity, of, mediocrity, he, believed, the, work, to, be, his, masterpiece, though, the, posthumous, version, received, lukewarm, reviews, flaubert, was, a, prolific, letter, writer, and, his, letters, have, been, collected, in, several, publications, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, may, have, been, working, on, a, further, historical, novel, based, on, the, battle, of, thermopylae, flaubert, famously, avoided, the, inexact, the, abstract, and, the, vaguely, inapt, expression, and, scrupulously, eschewed, the, clich, in, a, letter, to, george, sand, he, said, that, he, spent, his, time, trying, to, write, harmonious, sentences, avoiding, assonances, flaubert, believed, in, and, pursued, the, principle, of, finding, le, mot, juste, the, right, word, which, he, considered, as, the, key, means, to, achieve, high, quality, in, literary, art, he, worked, in, sullen, solitude, sometimes, occupying, a, week, in, the, completion, of, one, page, never, satisfied, with, what, he, had, composed, in, flaubert, s, correspondence, he, intimates, this, explaining, correct, prose, did, not, flow, out, of, him, and, that, his, style, was, achieved, through, work, and, revision, flaubert, said, he, wished, to, forge, a, style, that, would, be, rhythmic, as, verse, precise, as, the, language, of, the, sciences, undulant, deep, voiced, as, a, cello, tipped, with, flame, a, style, that, would, pierce, your, idea, like, a, dagger, and, on, which, your, thought, would, sail, easily, ahead, over, a, smooth, surface, like, a, skiff, before, a, good, tail, wind, he, famously, said, that, an, author, in, his, book, must, be, like, god, in, the, universe, present, everywhere, and, visible, nowhere, this, painstaking, style, of, writing, is, also, evident, when, one, compares, flaubert, s, output, over, a, lifetime, to, that, of, his, peers, for, example, balzac, or, zola, flaubert, published, much, less, prolifically, than, was, the, norm, for, his, time, and, never, got, near, the, pace, of, a, novel, a, year, as, his, peers, often, achieved, during, their, peaks, of, activity, walter, pater, famously, called, flaubert, the, martyr, of, style, in, the, assessment, of, critic, james, wood, novelists, should, thank, flaubert, the, way, poets, thank, spring, it, all, begins, again, with, him, there, really, is, a, time, before, flaubert, and, a, time, after, him, flaubert, decisively, established, what, most, readers, and, writers, think, of, as, modern, realist, narration, and, his, influence, is, almost, too, familiar, to, be, visible, we, hardly, remark, of, good, prose, that, it, favors, the, telling, and, brilliant, detail, that, it, privileges, a, high, degree, of, visual, noticing, that, it, maintains, an, unsentimental, composure, and, knows, how, to, withdraw, like, a, good, valet, from, superfluous, commentary, that, it, judges, good, and, bad, neutrally, that, it, seeks, out, the, truth, even, at, the, cost, of, repelling, us, and, that, the, author, s, fingerprints, on, all, this, are, paradoxically, traceable, but, not, visible, you, can, find, some, of, this, in, defoe, or, austen, or, balzac, but, not, all, of, it, until, flaubert, as, a, writer, other, than, a, pure, stylist, flaubert, was, nearly, equal, parts, romantic, and, realist, hence, members, of, various, schools, especially, realists, and, formalists, have, traced, their, origins, to, his, work, the, exactitude, with, which, he, adapts, his, expressions, to, his, purpose, can, be, seen, in, all, parts, of, his, work, especially, in, the, portraits, he, draws, of, the, figures, in, his, principal, romances, the, degree, to, which, flaubert, s, fame, has, extended, since, his, death, presents, an, interesting, chapter, of, literary, history, in, itself, he, is, also, credited, with, spreading, the, popularity, of, the, color, tuscany, cypress, a, color, often, mentioned, in, his, chef, d, uvre, madame, bovary, flaubert, s, lean, and, precise, writing, style, has, had, a, large, influence, on, 20th, century, writers, such, as, franz, kafka, and, j, m, coetzee, as, vladimir, nabokov, discussed, in, his, famous, lecture, series, the, greatest, literary, influence, upon, kafka, was, flaubert, s, flaubert, who, loathed, pretty, pretty, prose, would, have, applauded, kafka, s, attitude, towards, his, tool, kafka, liked, to, draw, his, terms, from, the, language, of, law, and, science, giving, them, a, kind, of, ironic, precision, with, no, intrusion, of, the, author, s, private, sentiments, this, was, exactly, flaubert, s, method, through, which, he, achieved, a, singular, poetic, effect, the, legacy, of, his, work, habits, can, best, be, described, therefore, as, paving, the, way, towards, a, slower, and, more, introspective, manner, of, writing, the, publication, of, madame, bovary, in, 1856, was, followed, by, more, scandal, than, admiration, it, was, not, understood, at, first, that, this, novel, was, the, beginning, of, something, new, the, scrupulously, truthful, portraiture, of, life, gradually, this, aspect, of, his, genius, was, accepted, and, it, began, to, crowd, out, all, others, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, widely, regarded, as, the, most, influential, french, realist, under, this, aspect, flaubert, exercised, an, extraordinary, influence, over, guy, de, maupassant, edmond, de, goncourt, alphonse, daudet, and, mile, zola, even, after, the, decline, of, the, realist, school, flaubert, did, not, lose, prestige, in, the, literary, community, he, continues, to, appeal, to, other, writers, because, of, his, deep, commitment, to, aesthetic, principles, his, devotion, to, style, and, his, indefatigable, pursuit, of, the, perfect, expression, his, uvres, compl, tes, 8, vols, 1885, were, printed, from, the, original, manuscripts, and, included, besides, the, works, mentioned, already, the, two, plays, le, candidat, and, le, ch, teau, des, c, urs, another, edition, 10, vols, appeared, in, 1873, 85, flaubert, s, correspondence, with, george, sand, was, published, in, 1884, with, an, introduction, by, guy, de, maupassant, he, has, been, admired, or, written, about, by, almost, every, major, literary, personality, of, the, 20th, century, including, philosophers, and, sociologists, such, as, michel, foucault, roland, barthes, pierre, bourdieu, and, jean, paul, sartre, the, latter, of, whose, partially, psychoanalytic, portrait, of, flaubert, in, the, family, idiot, was, published, in, 1971, georges, perec, named, sentimental, education, as, one, of, his, favourite, novels, the, peruvian, novelist, mario, vargas, llosa, is, another, great, admirer, of, flaubert, apart, from, perpetual, orgy, which, is, solely, devoted, to, flaubert, s, art, one, can, find, lucid, discussions, in, vargas, llosa, s, letters, to, a, young, novelist, published, 2003, in, a, public, lecture, in, may, 1966, at, the, kaufmann, art, gallery, in, new, york, marshall, mcluhan, claimed, i, derived, all, my, knowledge, of, media, from, people, like, flaubert, and, rimbaud, and, baudelaire, on, the, occasion, of, flaubert, s, 198th, birthday, 12, december, 2019, a, group, of, researchers, at, cnrs, published, a, neural, language, model, under, his, name
