because, of, a, rift, between, the, two, over, his, dissertation, horkheimer, had, made, unacceptable, demands, for, revision, as, well, as, his, own, belief, that, the, frankfurt, school, had,

drawing, on, a, number, of, intellectual, traditions, j, rgen, habermas, considers, his, major, contribution, to, be, the, development, of, the, concept, and, theory, of, communicative, reason, or, communicative, rationality, which, distinguishes, itself, from, the, rationalist, tradition, by, locating, rationality, in, structures, of, interpersonal, linguistic, communication, rather, than, in, the, structure, of, the, cosmos, this, social, theory, advances, the, goals, of, human, emancipation, while, maintaining, an, inclusive, universalist, moral, framework, this, framework, rests, on, the, argument, called, universal, pragmatics, that, all, speech, acts, have, an, inherent, telos, the, greek, word, for, purpose, the, goal, of, mutual, understanding, and, that, human, beings, possess, the, communicative, competence, to, bring, about, such, understanding, habermas, built, the, framework, out, of, the, speech, act, philosophy, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, j, l, austin, and, john, searle, the, sociological, theory, of, the, interactional, constitution, of, mind, and, self, of, george, herbert, mead, the, theories, of, moral, development, of, jean, piaget, and, lawrence, kohlberg, and, the, discourse, ethics, of, his, frankfurt, colleague, and, fellow, student, karl, otto, apel, habermas, s, works, resonate, within, the, traditions, of, kant, and, the, enlightenment, and, of, democratic, socialism, through, his, emphasis, on, the, potential, for, transforming, the, world, and, arriving, at, a, more, humane, just, and, egalitarian, society, through, the, realization, of, the, human, potential, for, reason, in, part, through, discourse, ethics, while, habermas, has, stated, that, the, enlightenment, is, an, unfinished, project, he, argues, it, should, be, corrected, and, complemented, not, discarded, in, this, he, distances, himself, from, the, frankfurt, school, criticizing, it, as, well, as, much, of, postmodernist, thought, for, excessive, pessimism, radicalism, and, exaggerations, within, sociology, habermas, s, major, contribution, was, the, development, of, a, comprehensive, theory, of, societal, evolution, and, modernization, focusing, on, the, difference, between, communicative, rationality, and, rationalization, on, one, hand, and, strategic, instrumental, rationality, and, rationalization, on, the, other, this, includes, a, critique, from, a, communicative, standpoint, of, the, differentiation, based, theory, of, social, systems, developed, by, niklas, luhmann, a, student, of, talcott, parsons, his, defence, of, modernity, and, civil, society, has, been, a, source, of, inspiration, to, others, and, is, considered, a, major, philosophical, alternative, to, the, varieties, of, poststructuralism, he, has, also, offered, an, influential, analysis, of, late, capitalism, habermas, perceives, the, rationalization, humanization, and, democratization, of, society, in, terms, of, the, institutionalization, of, the, potential, for, rationality, that, is, inherent, in, the, communicative, competence, that, is, unique, to, the, human, species, habermas, contends, that, communicative, competence, has, developed, through, the, course, of, evolution, but, in, contemporary, society, it, is, often, suppressed, or, weakened, by, the, way, in, which, major, domains, of, social, life, such, as, the, market, the, state, and, organizations, have, been, given, over, to, or, taken, over, by, strategic, instrumental, rationality, so, that, the, logic, of, the, system, supplants, that, of, the, lifeworld, habermas, introduces, the, concept, of, reconstructive, science, with, a, double, purpose, to, place, the, general, theory, of, society, between, philosophy, and, social, science, and, re, establish, the, rift, between, the, great, theorization, and, the, empirical, research, the, model, of, rational, reconstructions, represents, the, main, thread, of, the, surveys, about, the, structures, of, the, world, of, life, culture, society, and, personality, and, their, respective, functions, cultural, reproductions, social, integrations, and, socialization, for, this, purpose, the, dialectics, between, symbolic, representation, of, the, structures, subordinated, to, all, worlds, of, life, internal, relationships, and, the, material, reproduction, of, the, social, systems, in, their, complex, external, relationships, between, social, systems, and, environment, has, to, be, considered, this, model, finds, an, application, above, all, in, the, theory, of, the, social, evolution, starting, from, the, reconstruction, of, the, necessary, conditions, for, a, phylogeny, of, the, socio, cultural, life, forms, the, hominization, until, an, analysis, of, the, development, of, social, formations, which, habermas, subdivides, into, primitive, traditional, modern, and, contemporary, formations, this, paper, is, an, attempt, primarily, to, formalize, the, model, of, reconstruction, of, the, logic, of, development, of, social, formations, summed, up, by, habermas, through, the, differentiation, between, vital, world, and, social, systems, and, within, them, through, the, rationalization, of, the, world, of, life, and, the, growth, in, complexity, of, the, social, systems, secondly, it, tries, to, offer, some, methodological, clarifications, about, the, explanation, of, the, dynamics, of, historical, processes, and, in, particular, about, the, theoretical, meaning, of, the, evolutional, theory, s, propositions, even, if, the, german, sociologist, considers, that, the, ex, post, rational, reconstructions, and, the, models, system, environment, cannot, have, a, complete, historiographical, application, these, certainly, act, as, a, general, premise, in, the, argumentative, structure, of, the, historical, explanation, in, the, structural, transformation, of, the, public, sphere, habermas, argues, that, prior, to, the, 18th, century, european, culture, had, been, dominated, by, a, representational, culture, where, one, party, sought, to, represent, itself, on, its, audience, by, overwhelming, its, subjects, as, an, example, of, representational, culture, habermas, argued, that, louis, xiv, s, palace, of, versailles, was, meant, to, show, the, greatness, of, the, french, state, and, its, king, by, overpowering, the, senses, of, visitors, to, the, palace, habermas, identifies, representational, culture, as, corresponding, to, the, feudal, stage, of, development, according, to, marxist, theory, arguing, that, the, coming, of, the, capitalist, stage, of, development, marked, the, appearance, of, ffentlichkeit, the, public, sphere, in, the, culture, characterized, by, ffentlichkeit, there, occurred, a, public, space, outside, of, the, control, by, the, state, where, individuals, exchanged, views, and, knowledge, in, habermas, s, view, the, growth, in, newspapers, journals, reading, clubs, masonic, lodges, and, coffeehouses, in, 18th, century, europe, all, in, different, ways, marked, the, gradual, replacement, of, representational, culture, with, ffentlichkeit, culture, habermas, argued, that, the, essential, characteristic, of, the, ffentlichkeit, culture, was, its, critical, nature, unlike, representational, culture, where, only, one, party, was, active, and, the, other, passive, the, ffentlichkeit, culture, was, characterized, by, a, dialogue, as, individuals, either, met, in, conversation, or, exchanged, views, via, the, print, media, habermas, maintains, that, as, britain, was, the, most, liberal, country, in, europe, the, culture, of, the, public, sphere, emerged, there, first, around, 1700, and, the, growth, of, ffentlichkeit, culture, took, place, over, most, of, the, 18th, century, in, continental, europe, in, his, view, the, french, revolution, was, in, large, part, caused, by, the, collapse, of, representational, culture, and, its, replacement, by, ffentlichkeit, culture, though, habermas, s, main, concern, in, the, structural, transformation, of, the, public, sphere, was, to, expose, what, he, regarded, as, the, deceptive, nature, of, free, institutions, in, the, west, his, book, had, a, major, effect, on, the, historiography, of, the, french, revolution, according, to, habermas, a, variety, of, factors, resulted, in, the, eventual, decay, of, the, public, sphere, including, the, growth, of, a, commercial, mass, media, which, turned, the, critical, public, into, a, passive, consumer, public, and, the, welfare, state, which, merged, the, state, with, society, so, thoroughly, that, the, public, sphere, was, squeezed, out, it, also, turned, the, public, sphere, into, a, site, of, self, interested, contestation, for, the, resources, of, the, state, rather, than, a, space, for, the, development, of, a, public, minded, rational, consensus, his, most, known, work, to, date, the, theory, of, communicative, action, 1981, is, based, on, an, adaptation, of, talcott, parsons, agil, paradigm, in, this, work, habermas, voiced, criticism, of, the, process, of, modernization, which, he, saw, as, inflexible, direction, forced, through, by, economic, and, administrative, rationalization, habermas, outlined, how, our, everyday, lives, are, penetrated, by, formal, systems, as, parallel, to, development, of, the, welfare, state, corporate, capitalism, and, mass, consumption, these, reinforcing, trends, rationalize, public, life, disfranchisement, of, citizens, occurs, as, political, parties, and, interest, groups, become, rationalized, and, representative, democracy, replaces, participatory, one, in, consequence, boundaries, between, public, and, private, the, individual, and, society, the, system, and, the, lifeworld, are, deteriorating, democratic, public, life, cannot, develop, where, matters, of, public, importance, are, not, discussed, by, citizens, an, ideal, speech, situation, requires, participants, to, have, the, same, capacities, of, discourse, social, equality, and, their, words, are, not, confused, by, ideology, or, other, errors, in, this, version, of, the, consensus, theory, of, truth, habermas, maintains, that, truth, is, what, would, be, agreed, upon, in, an, ideal, speech, situation, habermas, has, expressed, optimism, about, the, possibility, of, the, revival, of, the, public, sphere, he, discerns, a, hope, for, the, future, where, the, representative, democracy, reliant, nation, state, is, replaced, by, a, deliberative, democracy, reliant, political, organism, based, on, the, equal, rights, and, obligations, of, citizens, in, such, a, direct, democracy, driven, system, the, activist, public, sphere, is, needed, for, debates, on, matters, of, public, importance, as, well, as, the, mechanism, for, that, discussion, to, affect, the, decision, making, process, habermas, offered, some, early, criticisms, in, an, essay, modernity, versus, postmodernity, 1981, which, has, achieved, wide, recognition, in, that, essay, habermas, raises, the, issue, of, whether, in, light, of, the, failures, of, the, twentieth, century, we, should, try, to, hold, on, to, the, intentions, of, the, enlightenment, feeble, as, they, may, be, or, should, we, declare, the, entire, project, of, modernity, a, lost, cause, habermas, refuses, to, give, up, on, the, possibility, of, a, rational, scientific, understanding, of, the, life, world, habermas, has, several, main, criticisms, of, postmodernism, the, positivism, dispute, was, a, political, philosophical, dispute, between, the, critical, rationalists, karl, popper, hans, albert, and, the, frankfurt, school, theodor, adorno, j, rgen, habermas, in, 1961, about, the, methodology, of, the, social, sciences, it, grew, into, a, broad, discussion, within, german, sociology, from, 1961, to, 1969, there, is, a, controversy, between, habermas, and, hans, georg, gadamer, about, limits, of, hermeneutics, gadamer, completed, his, magnum, opus, truth, and, method, in, 1960, and, engaged, in, his, debate, with, habermas, over, the, possibility, of, transcending, history, and, culture, in, order, to, find, a, truly, objective, position, from, which, to, critique, society, during, the, 1960s, gadamer, supported, habermas, and, advocated, for, him, to, be, offered, a, job, at, heidelberg, before, he, had, completed, his, habilitation, despite, max, horkheimer, s, objections, while, they, both, criticized, positivism, a, philosophical, disagreement, arose, between, them, in, the, 1970s, this, disagreement, expanded, the, scope, of, gadamer, s, philosophical, influence, despite, fundamental, agreements, between, them, such, as, starting, from, the, hermeneutic, tradition, and, returning, to, greek, practical, philosophy, habermas, argued, that, gadamer, s, emphasis, on, tradition, and, prejudice, blinded, him, to, the, ideological, operation, of, power, habermas, believed, that, gadamer, s, approach, failed, to, enable, critical, reflection, on, the, sources, of, ideology, in, society, he, accused, gadamer, of, endorsing, a, dogmatic, stance, toward, tradition, which, made, it, difficult, to, identify, distortions, in, understanding, gadamer, countered, that, refusing, the, universal, nature, of, hermeneutics, was, the, more, dogmatic, stance, because, it, affirmed, the, deception, that, the, subject, can, free, itself, from, the, past, there, is, a, dispute, concerning, whether, michel, foucault, s, ideas, of, power, analytics, and, genealogy, or, j, rgen, habermas, s, ideas, of, communicative, rationality, and, discourse, ethics, provide, a, better, critique, of, the, nature, of, power, in, society, the, debate, compares, and, evaluates, the, central, ideas, of, habermas, and, foucault, as, they, pertain, to, questions, of, power, reason, ethics, modernity, democracy, civil, society, and, social, action, niklas, luhmann, proposed, that, society, could, be, successfully, analyzed, through, systems, theory, there, is, a, conflict, between, j, rgen, habermas, s, theory, of, communicative, action, and, luhmann, s, systems, theory, habermas, and, karl, otto, apel, both, support, a, postmetaphysical, universal, moral, theory, but, they, disagree, on, the, nature, and, justification, of, this, principle, habermas, disagrees, with, apel, s, view, that, the, principle, is, a, transcendental, condition, of, human, activity, while, apel, asserts, that, it, is, they, each, criticize, the, other, s, position, habermas, argues, that, apel, is, too, concerned, with, transcendental, conditions, while, apel, argues, that, habermas, doesn, t, value, critical, discourse, enough, there, is, a, debate, between, habermas, and, john, rawls, the, debate, centers, around, the, question, of, how, to, do, political, philosophy, under, conditions, of, cultural, pluralism, if, the, aim, of, political, philosophy, is, to, uncover, the, normative, foundation, of, a, modern, liberal, democracy, habermas, believes, that, rawls, s, view, is, inconsistent, with, the, idea, of, popular, sovereignty, while, rawls, argues, that, political, legitimacy, is, solely, a, matter, of, sound, moral, reasoning, or, that, democratic, will, formation, has, been, unduly, downgraded, in, his, theory, habermas, is, famous, as, a, public, intellectual, as, well, as, a, scholar, most, notably, in, the, 1980s, he, used, the, popular, press, to, attack, the, german, historians, ernst, nolte, michael, st, rmer, klaus, hildebrand, and, andreas, hillgruber, habermas, first, expressed, his, views, on, the, above, mentioned, historians, in, the, die, zeit, on, 11, july, 1986, in, a, feuilleton, a, type, of, culture, and, arts, opinion, essay, in, german, newspapers, entitled, a, kind, of, settlement, of, damages, habermas, criticized, nolte, hildebrand, st, rmer, and, hillgruber, for, apologistic, history, writing, in, regard, to, the, nazi, era, and, for, seeking, to, close, germany, s, opening, to, the, west, that, in, habermas, s, view, had, existed, since, 1945, habermas, argued, that, nolte, st, rmer, hildebrand, and, hillgruber, had, tried, to, detach, nazi, rule, and, the, holocaust, from, the, mainstream, of, german, history, explain, away, nazism, as, a, reaction, to, bolshevism, and, partially, rehabilitate, the, reputation, of, the, wehrmacht, german, army, during, world, war, ii, habermas, wrote, that, st, rmer, was, trying, to, create, a, vicarious, religion, in, german, history, which, together, with, the, work, of, hillgruber, glorifying, the, last, days, of, the, german, army, on, the, eastern, front, was, intended, to, serve, as, a, kind, of, nato, philosophy, colored, with, german, nationalism, about, hillgruber, s, statement, that, adolf, hitler, wanted, to, exterminate, the, jews, because, only, such, a, racial, revolution, could, lend, permanence, to, the, world, power, status, of, his, reich, habermas, wrote, since, hillgruber, does, not, use, the, verb, in, the, subjunctive, one, does, not, know, whether, the, historian, has, adopted, the, perspective, of, the, particulars, this, time, too, habermas, wrote, the, unconditional, opening, of, the, federal, republic, to, the, political, culture, of, the, west, is, the, greatest, intellectual, achievement, of, our, postwar, period, my, generation, should, be, especially, proud, of, this, this, event, cannot, and, should, not, be, stabilized, by, a, kind, of, nato, philosophy, colored, with, german, nationalism, the, opening, of, the, federal, republic, has, been, achieved, precisely, by, overcoming, the, ideology, of, central, europe, that, our, revisionists, are, trying, to, warm, up, for, us, with, their, geopolitical, drumbeat, about, the, old, geographically, central, position, of, the, germans, in, europe, st, rmer, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, destroyed, european, center, hillgruber, the, only, patriotism, that, will, not, estrange, us, from, the, west, is, a, constitutional, patriotism, the, so, called, historikerstreit, historians, quarrel, was, not, at, all, one, sided, because, habermas, was, himself, attacked, by, scholars, like, joachim, fest, hagen, schulze, horst, m, ller, imanuel, geiss, and, klaus, hildebrand, in, turn, habermas, was, supported, by, historians, such, as, martin, broszat, eberhard, j, ckel, hans, mommsen, and, hans, ulrich, wehler, habermas, and, jacques, derrida, engaged, in, a, series, of, disputes, beginning, in, the, 1980s, and, culminating, in, a, mutual, understanding, and, friendship, in, the, late, 1990s, that, lasted, until, derrida, s, death, in, 2004, they, originally, came, in, contact, when, habermas, invited, derrida, to, speak, at, the, university, of, frankfurt, in, 1984, the, next, year, habermas, published, beyond, a, temporalized, philosophy, of, origins, derrida, in, the, philosophical, discourse, of, modernity, in, which, he, described, derrida, s, method, as, being, unable, to, provide, a, foundation, for, social, critique, derrida, citing, habermas, as, an, example, remarked, that, those, who, have, accused, me, of, reducing, philosophy, to, literature, or, logic, to, rhetoric, have, visibly, and, carefully, avoided, reading, me, after, derrida, s, final, rebuttal, in, 1989, the, two, philosophers, did, not, continue, but, as, derrida, described, it, groups, in, the, academy, conducted, a, kind, of, war, in, which, we, ourselves, never, took, part, either, personally, or, directly, at, the, end, of, the, 1990s, habermas, approached, derrida, at, a, party, held, at, an, american, university, where, both, were, lecturing, they, then, met, at, paris, over, dinner, and, participated, afterwards, in, many, joint, projects, in, 2000, they, held, a, joint, seminar, on, problems, of, philosophy, right, ethics, and, politics, at, the, university, of, frankfurt, in, december, 2000, in, paris, habermas, gave, a, lecture, entitled, how, to, answer, the, ethical, question, at, the, judeities, questions, for, jacques, derrida, conference, organized, by, joseph, cohen, and, raphael, zagury, orly, following, the, lecture, by, habermas, both, thinkers, engaged, in, a, very, heated, debate, on, heidegger, and, the, possibility, of, ethics, the, conference, volume, was, published, at, the, editions, galil, e, paris, in, 2002, and, subsequently, in, english, at, fordham, university, press, 2007, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 11, september, attacks, derrida, and, habermas, laid, out, their, individual, opinions, on, 9, 11, and, the, war, on, terror, in, giovanna, borradori, s, philosophy, in, a, time, of, terror, dialogues, with, j, rgen, habermas, and, jacques, derrida, in, early, 2003, both, habermas, and, derrida, were, very, active, in, opposing, the, coming, iraq, war, in, a, manifesto, that, later, became, the, book, old, europe, new, europe, core, europe, the, two, called, for, a, tighter, unification, of, the, states, of, the, european, union, in, order, to, create, a, power, capable, of, opposing, american, foreign, policy, derrida, wrote, a, foreword, expressing, his, unqualified, subscription, to, habermas, s, declaration, of, february, 2003, february, 15, or, what, binds, europeans, together, plea, for, a, common, foreign, policy, beginning, in, core, europe, in, the, book, which, was, a, reaction, to, the, bush, administration, s, demands, upon, european, nations, for, support, in, the, coming, iraq, war, habermas, s, attitudes, toward, religion, have, changed, throughout, the, years, analyst, phillippe, portier, identifies, three, phases, in, habermas, s, attitude, towards, this, social, sphere, the, first, in, the, decade, of, 1980, when, the, younger, j, rgen, in, the, spirit, of, marx, argued, against, religion, seeing, it, as, an, alienating, reality, and, control, tool, the, second, phase, from, the, mid, 1980s, to, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, when, he, stopped, discussing, it, and, as, a, secular, commentator, relegated, it, to, matters, of, private, life, and, the, third, from, then, until, now, when, habermas, saw, a, positive, social, role, of, religion, in, an, interview, in, 1999, habermas, had, stated, for, the, normative, self, understanding, of, modernity, christianity, has, functioned, as, more, than, just, a, precursor, or, catalyst, universalistic, egalitarianism, from, which, sprang, the, ideals, of, freedom, and, a, collective, life, in, solidarity, the, autonomous, conduct, of, life, and, emancipation, the, individual, morality, of, conscience, human, rights, and, democracy, is, the, direct, legacy, of, the, judaic, ethic, of, justice, and, the, christian, ethic, of, love, this, legacy, substantially, unchanged, has, been, the, object, of, a, continual, critical, reappropriation, and, reinterpretation, up, to, this, very, day, there, is, no, alternative, to, it, and, in, light, of, the, current, challenges, of, a, post, national, constellation, we, must, draw, sustenance, now, as, in, the, past, from, this, substance, everything, else, is, idle, postmodern, talk, the, original, german, from, the, habermas, forum, website, of, the, disputed, quotation, is, das, christentum, ist, f, r, das, normative, selbstverst, ndnis, der, moderne, nicht, nur, eine, vorl, ufergestalt, oder, ein, katalysator, gewesen, der, egalit, re, universalismus, aus, dem, die, ideen, von, freiheit, und, solidarischem, zusammenleben, von, autonomer, lebensf, hrung, und, emanzipation, von, individueller, gewissensmoral, menschenrechten, und, demokratie, entsprungen, sind, ist, unmittelbar, ein, erbe, der, j, dischen, gerechtigkeits, und, der, christlichen, liebesethik, in, der, substanz, unver, ndert, ist, dieses, erbe, immer, wieder, kritisch, angeeignet, und, neu, interpretiert, worden, dazu, gibt, es, bis, heute, keine, alternative, auch, angesichts, der, aktuellen, herausforderungen, einer, postnationalen, konstellation, zehren, wir, nach, wie, vor, von, dieser, substanz, alles, andere, ist, postmodernes, gerede, this, statement, has, been, misquoted, in, a, number, of, articles, and, books, where, habermas, instead, is, quoted, for, saying, christianity, and, nothing, else, is, the, ultimate, foundation, of, liberty, conscience, human, rights, and, democracy, the, benchmarks, of, western, civilization, to, this, day, we, have, no, other, options, we, continue, to, nourish, ourselves, from, this, source, everything, else, is, postmodern, chatter, in, his, book, zwischen, naturalismus, und, religion, between, naturalism, and, religion, 2005, habermas, stated, that, the, forces, of, religious, strength, as, a, result, of, multiculturalism, and, immigration, are, stronger, than, in, previous, decades, and, therefore, there, is, a, need, of, tolerance, which, must, be, understood, as, a, two, way, street, secular, people, need, to, tolerate, the, role, of, religious, people, in, the, public, square, and, vice, versa, in, early, 2007, ignatius, press, published, a, dialogue, between, habermas, and, the, then, prefect, of, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, of, the, holy, office, joseph, ratzinger, elected, as, pope, benedict, xvi, in, 2005, entitled, the, dialectics, of, secularization, the, dialogue, took, place, on, 14, january, 2004, after, an, invitation, to, both, thinkers, by, the, catholic, academy, of, bavaria, in, munich, it, addressed, contemporary, questions, such, as, in, this, debate, a, shift, of, habermas, became, evident, in, particular, his, rethinking, of, the, public, role, of, religion, habermas, stated, that, he, wrote, as, a, methodological, atheist, which, means, that, when, doing, philosophy, or, social, science, he, presumed, nothing, about, particular, religious, beliefs, yet, while, writing, from, this, perspective, his, evolving, position, towards, the, role, of, religion, in, society, led, him, to, some, challenging, questions, and, as, a, result, conceding, some, ground, in, his, dialogue, with, the, future, pope, that, would, seem, to, have, consequences, which, further, complicated, the, positions, he, holds, about, a, communicative, rational, solution, to, the, problems, of, modernity, habermas, believes, that, even, for, self, identified, liberal, thinkers, to, exclude, religious, voices, from, the, public, square, is, highly, illiberal, in, addition, habermas, has, popularized, the, concept, of, post, secular, society, to, refer, to, current, times, in, which, the, idea, of, modernity, is, perceived, as, unsuccessful, and, at, times, morally, failed, so, that, rather, than, a, stratification, or, separation, a, new, peaceful, dialogue, and, coexistence, between, faith, and, reason, must, be, sought, in, order, to, learn, mutually, habermas, has, sided, with, other, 20th, century, commentators, on, marx, such, as, hannah, arendt, who, have, indicated, concerns, with, the, limits, of, totalitarian, perspectives, often, associated, with, marx, s, over, estimation, of, the, emancipatory, potential, of, the, forces, of, production, arendt, had, presented, this, in, her, book, the, origins, of, totalitarianism, and, habermas, extends, this, critique, in, his, writings, on, functional, reductionism, in, the, life, world, in, his, lifeworld, and, system, a, critique, of, functionalist, reason, as, habermas, states, traditional, marxist, analysis, today, when, we, use, the, means, of, the, critique, of, political, economy, can, no, longer, make, clear, predictions, for, that, one, would, still, have, to, assume, the, autonomy, of, a, self, reproducing, economic, system, i, do, not, believe, in, such, an, autonomy, precisely, for, this, reason, the, laws, governing, the, economic, system, are, no, longer, identical, to, the, ones, marx, analyzed, of, course, this, does, not, mean, that, it, would, be, wrong, to, analyze, the, mechanism, which, drives, the, economic, system, but, in, order, for, the, orthodox, version, of, such, an, analysis, to, be, valid, the, influence, of, the, political, system, would, have, to, be, ignored, habermas, reiterated, the, positions, that, what, refuted, marx, and, his, theory, of, class, struggle, was, the, pacification, of, class, conflict, by, the, welfare, state, which, had, developed, in, the, west, since, 1945, thanks, to, a, reformist, relying, on, the, instruments, of, keynesian, economics, italian, philosopher, and, historian, domenico, losurdo, criticised, the, main, point, of, these, claims, as, marked, by, the, absence, of, a, question, that, should, be, obvious, was, the, advent, of, the, welfare, state, the, inevitable, result, of, a, tendency, inherent, in, capitalism, or, was, it, the, result, of, political, and, social, mobilization, by, the, subaltern, classes, in, the, final, analysis, of, a, class, struggle, had, the, german, philosopher, posed, this, question, perhaps, he, would, have, avoided, assuming, the, permanence, of, the, welfare, state, whose, precariousness, and, progressive, dismantlement, are, now, obvious, to, everyone, in, 1999, habermas, addressed, the, kosovo, war, habermas, defended, nato, s, intervention, in, an, article, for, die, zeit, which, stirred, controversy, in, 2001, habermas, argued, that, the, united, states, should, not, go, to, war, in, iraq, on, 13, november, 2023, habermas, issued, a, statement, supporting, israel, s, military, response, to, the, hamas, led, attack, on, israel, rejecting, the, term, genocide, in, reference, to, its, actions, in, the, gaza, strip, during, the, european, debt, crisis, habermas, criticized, angela, merkel, s, leadership, in, europe, in, 2013, habermas, clashed, with, wolfgang, streeck, who, argued, the, kind, of, european, federalism, espoused, by, habermas, was, the, root, of, the, continent, s, crisis
