the, conventional, ceremonial, banquet, for, laureates, asking, that, its, 192, 000, cost, be, given, to, the, poor, in, india, and, saying, that, earthly, rewards, were, important, only, if, they, helped, her, to, help, the, world, s, needy, when, mother, teresa, received, the, prize, she, was, asked, what, can, we, do, to, promote, world, peace, she, answered, go, home, and, love, your, family, building, on, this, theme, in, her, nobel, lecture, she, said, around, the, world, not, only, in, the, poor, countries, but, i, found, the, poverty, of, the, west, so, much, more, difficult, to, remove, when, i, pick, up, a, person, from, the, street, hungry, i, give, him, a, plate, of, rice, a, piece, of, bread, i, have, satisfied, i, have, removed, that, hunger, but, a, person, that, is, shut, out, that, feels, unwanted, unloved, terrified, the, person, that, has, been, thrown, out, from, society, that, poverty, is, so, hurtable, and, so, much, and, i, find, that, very, difficult, mother, teresa, singled, out, abortion, as, the, greatest, destroyer, of, peace, today, because, if, a, mother, can, kill, her, own, child, what, is, left, for, me, to, kill, you, and, you, kill, me, there, is, nothing, between, barbara, smoker, of, the, secular, humanist, magazine, the, freethinker, criticised, mother, teresa, after, the, peace, prize, award, saying, that, her, promotion, of, catholic, moral, teachings, on, abortion, and, contraception, diverted, funds, from, effective, methods, to, solve, india, s, problems, at, the, fourth, world, conference, on, women, in, beijing, mother, teresa, said, yet, we, can, destroy, this, gift, of, motherhood, especially, by, the, evil, of, abortion, but, also, by, thinking, that, other, things, like, jobs, or, positions, are, more, important, than, loving, abortion, rights, groups, have, also, criticised, mother, teresa, s, stance, against, abortion, and, contraception, according, to, a, paper, by, canadian, academics, serge, lariv, e, genevi, ve, ch, nard, and, carole, s, n, chal, mother, teresa, s, clinics, received, millions, of, dollars, in, donations, but, lacked, medical, care, systematic, diagnosis, necessary, nutrition, and, sufficient, analgesics, for, those, in, pain, in, the, opinion, of, the, three, academics, mother, teresa, believed, the, sick, must, suffer, like, christ, on, the, cross, it, was, said, that, the, additional, money, might, have, transformed, the, health, of, the, city, s, poor, by, creating, advanced, palliative, care, facilities, one, of, mother, teresa, s, most, outspoken, critics, was, english, journalist, and, antitheist, christopher, hitchens, host, of, the, documentary, hell, s, angel, 1994, and, author, of, the, essay, the, missionary, position, mother, teresa, in, theory, and, practice, 1995, who, wrote, in, a, 2003, article, this, returns, us, to, the, medieval, corruption, of, the, church, which, sold, indulgences, to, the, rich, while, preaching, hellfire, and, continence, to, the, poor, was, not, a, friend, of, the, poor, she, was, a, friend, of, poverty, she, said, that, suffering, was, a, gift, from, god, she, spent, her, life, opposing, the, only, known, cure, for, poverty, which, is, the, empowerment, of, women, and, the, emancipation, of, them, from, a, livestock, version, of, compulsory, reproduction, he, accused, her, of, hypocrisy, for, choosing, advanced, treatment, for, her, heart, condition, hitchens, said, that, her, intention, was, not, to, help, people, and, that, she, lied, to, donors, about, how, their, contributions, were, used, it, was, by, talking, to, her, that, i, discovered, and, she, assured, me, that, she, wasn, t, working, to, alleviate, poverty, he, said, she, was, working, to, expand, the, number, of, catholics, she, said, i, m, not, a, social, worker, i, don, t, do, it, for, this, reason, i, do, it, for, christ, i, do, it, for, the, church, navin, b, chawla, points, out, that, mother, teresa, never, intended, to, build, hospitals, but, to, provide, a, place, where, those, who, had, been, refused, admittance, could, at, least, die, being, comforted, and, with, some, dignity, he, also, counters, critics, of, mother, teresa, by, stating, that, her, periodic, hospitalizations, were, instigated, by, staff, members, against, her, wishes, and, he, disputes, the, claim, that, she, conducted, unethical, conversions, those, who, are, quick, to, criticise, mother, teresa, and, her, mission, are, unable, or, unwilling, to, do, anything, to, help, with, their, own, hands, similarly, sister, mary, prema, pierick, the, former, superior, general, of, the, missionaries, of, charity, also, stated, that, mother, teresa, s, homes, were, never, intended, to, be, a, substitute, for, hospitals, but, rather, homes, for, those, not, accepted, in, the, hospital, but, if, they, need, hospital, care, then, we, have, to, take, them, to, the, hospital, and, we, do, that, sister, pierick, also, contested, the, claims, that, mother, teresa, deliberately, cultivated, suffering, and, affirmed, her, order, s, goal, was, to, alleviate, suffering, fr, des, wilson, who, had, hosted, her, in, belfast, in, 1971, argued, that, mother, theresa, was, content, to, pick, up, the, sad, pieces, left, by, a, vicious, political, and, economic, system, and, he, noted, that, hers, was, a, fate, very, different, to, that, of, archbishop, scar, romero, of, el, salvador, while, she, got, the, nobel, prize, romero, who, attacked, the, causes, of, misery, as, well, as, picking, up, the, pieces, was, shot, in, the, head, in, 1994, mother, teresa, argued, that, the, sexual, abuse, allegations, against, jesuit, priest, donald, mcguire, were, untrue, when, he, was, convicted, of, sexually, molesting, multiple, children, in, 2006, mother, teresa, s, defence, of, him, was, criticised, analysing, her, deeds, and, achievements, pope, john, paul, ii, said, where, did, mother, teresa, find, the, strength, and, perseverance, to, place, herself, completely, at, the, service, of, others, she, found, it, in, prayer, and, in, the, silent, contemplation, of, jesus, christ, his, holy, face, his, sacred, heart, privately, mother, teresa, experienced, doubts, and, struggle, in, her, religious, beliefs, which, lasted, nearly, 50, years, until, the, end, of, her, life, mother, teresa, expressed, grave, doubts, about, god, s, existence, and, pain, over, her, lack, of, faith, where, is, my, faith, even, deep, down, there, is, nothing, but, emptiness, and, darkness, if, there, be, god, please, forgive, me, when, i, try, to, raise, my, thoughts, to, heaven, there, is, such, convicting, emptiness, that, those, very, thoughts, return, like, sharp, knives, and, hurt, my, very, soul, other, saints, including, teresa, s, namesake, th, r, se, of, lisieux, who, called, it, a, night, of, nothingness, had, similar, experiences, of, spiritual, dryness, according, to, james, langford, these, doubts, were, typical, and, would, not, be, an, impediment, to, canonisation, after, ten, years, of, doubt, mother, teresa, described, a, brief, period, of, renewed, faith, after, pope, pius, xii, s, death, in, 1958, she, was, praying, for, him, at, a, requiem, mass, when, she, was, relieved, of, the, long, darkness, that, strange, suffering, however, five, weeks, later, her, spiritual, dryness, returned, mother, teresa, wrote, many, letters, to, her, confessors, and, superiors, over, a, 66, year, period, most, notably, to, calcutta, archbishop, ferdinand, perier, and, jesuit, priest, celeste, van, exem, her, spiritual, advisor, since, the, formation, of, the, missionaries, of, charity, she, requested, that, her, letters, be, destroyed, concerned, that, people, will, think, more, of, me, less, of, jesus, however, the, correspondence, was, compiled, in, mother, teresa, come, be, my, light, mother, teresa, wrote, to, spiritual, confidant, michael, van, der, peet, jesus, has, a, very, special, love, for, you, as, for, me, the, silence, and, the, emptiness, is, so, great, that, i, look, and, do, not, see, listen, and, do, not, hear, the, tongue, moves, but, does, not, speak, i, want, you, to, pray, for, me, that, i, let, him, have, free, hand, in, deus, caritas, est, his, first, encyclical, pope, benedict, xvi, mentioned, mother, teresa, three, times, and, used, her, life, to, clarify, one, of, the, encyclical, s, main, points, in, the, example, of, blessed, teresa, of, calcutta, we, have, a, clear, illustration, of, the, fact, that, time, devoted, to, god, in, prayer, not, only, does, not, detract, from, effective, and, loving, service, to, our, neighbour, but, is, in, fact, the, inexhaustible, source, of, that, service, she, wrote, it, is, only, by, mental, prayer, and, spiritual, reading, that, we, can, cultivate, the, gift, of, prayer, although, her, order, was, not, connected, with, the, franciscan, orders, mother, teresa, admired, francis, of, assisi, and, was, influenced, by, franciscan, spirituality, the, sisters, of, charity, recite, the, prayer, of, saint, francis, every, morning, at, mass, during, the, thanksgiving, after,
