would, become, the, velvet, underground, were, laid, in, late, 1964, singer, songwriter, and, guitarist, lou, reed, had, performed, with, a, few, short, lived, garage, bands, and, had, worked, as, a, songwriter, for, pickwick, records, reed, described, his, tenure, there, as, being, a, poor, man, s, carole, king, reed, met, john, cale, a, welshman, who, had, moved, to, the, united, states, to, study, classical, music, upon, securing, a, leonard, bernstein, scholarship, cale, had, worked, with, experimental, composers, john, cage, cornelius, cardew, and, la, monte, young, and, had, performed, with, young, s, theatre, of, eternal, music, though, was, also, interested, in, rock, music, young, s, use, of, extended, drones, would, be, a, profound, influence, on, the, band, s, early, sound, cale, was, pleasantly, surprised, to, discover, that, reed, s, experimentalist, tendencies, were, similar, to, his, own, reed, sometimes, used, alternative, guitar, tunings, to, create, a, droning, sound, the, pair, rehearsed, and, performed, together, their, partnership, and, shared, interests, built, the, path, towards, what, would, later, become, the, velvet, underground, reed, s, first, group, with, cale, was, the, primitives, a, short, lived, group, assembled, to, issue, budget, priced, recordings, and, support, an, anti, dance, single, written, by, reed, the, ostrich, to, which, cale, added, a, viola, passage, reed, and, cale, recruited, sterling, morrison, a, college, classmate, of, reed, s, at, syracuse, university, as, a, replacement, for, walter, de, maria, who, had, been, a, third, member, of, the, primitives, reed, and, morrison, both, played, guitars, cale, played, viola, keyboards, and, bass, and, angus, maclise, joined, on, percussion, to, complete, the,

about, the, secret, sexual, subculture, of, the, early, 1960s, cale, s, friend, and, dream, syndicate, associate, tony, conrad, showed, it, to, the, group, and, maclise, made, a, suggestion, to, adopt, the, title, as, the, band, s, name, according, to, reed, and, morrison, the, group, liked, the, name, considering, it, evocative, of, underground, cinema, and, fitting, as, reed, had, already, written, venus, in, furs, a, song, inspired, by, leopold, von, sacher, masoch, s, book, of, the, same, name, which, dealt, with, masochism, the, band, immediately, and, unanimously, adopted, the, velvet, underground, as, its, new, name, in, november, 1965, the, newly, named, velvet, underground, rehearsed, and, performed, in, new, york, city, their, music, was, generally, much, more, relaxed, than, it, would, later, become, cale, described, this, era, as, reminiscent, of, beat, poetry, with, maclise, playing, gentle, pitter, and, patter, rhythms, behind, the, drone, in, july, 1965, reed, cale, and, morrison, recorded, a, demo, tape, at, their, ludlow, street, loft, without, maclise, because, he, refused, to, be, tied, down, to, a, schedule, and, would, turn, up, to, band, practice, sessions, only, when, he, wanted, when, he, briefly, returned, to, britain, cale, attempted, to, give, a, copy, of, the, tape, to, marianne, faithfull, hoping, she, would, pass, it, on, to, mick, jagger, lead, singer, of, the, rolling, stones, nothing, ever, came, of, this, but, the, demo, was, eventually, released, on, the, 1995, box, set, peel, slowly, and, see, manager, and, music,

when, they, decided, to, take, the, gig, maclise, abruptly, left, the, group, protesting, what, he, considered, a, sellout, he, was, also, unwilling, to, be, told, when, to, start, and, stop, playing, angus, was, in, it, for, art, morrison, reported, maclise, was, replaced, by, maureen, moe, tucker, the, younger, sister, of, morrison, s, friend, jim, tucker, tucker, s, playing, style, was, rather, unusual, she, generally, played, standing, up, rather, than, seated, and, had, an, abbreviated, drum, setup, of, tom, toms, snare, and, an, upturned, bass, drum, using, mallets, as, often, as, drumsticks, and, rarely, using, cymbals, she, admits, that, she, always, hated, cymbals, when, the, band, asked, her, to, do, something, unusual, she, turned, her, bass, drum, on, its, side, and, played, standing, up, after, her, drums, were, stolen, from, one, club, she, replaced, them, with, garbage, cans, brought, in, from, outside, her, rhythms, at, once, simple, and, exotic, influenced, by, the, likes, of, babatunde, olatunji, and, bo, diddley, as, well, as, charlie, watts, of, the, rolling, stones, became, a, vital, part, of, the, group, s, music, despite, cale, s, initial, objections, to, the, presence, of, a, female, drummer, the, group, earned, a, regular, paying, gig, at, the, caf, bizarre, and, gained, an, early, reputation, as, a, promising, ensemble, in, 1965, after, being, introduced, to, the, velvet, underground, by, filmmaker, barbara, rubin, andy, warhol, became, the, band, s, manager, and, suggested, they, use, the, german, born, singer, nico, born, christa, p, ffgen, on, several, songs, warhol, s, reputation, helped, the, band, gain, a, higher, profile, he, helped, the, band, secure, a, recording, contract, with, mgm, s, verve, records, with, himself, as, nominal, producer, and, gave, the, velvets, free, rein, over, the, sound, they, created, during, their, stay, with, andy, warhol, the, band, became, part, of, his, multimedia, roadshow, exploding, plastic, inevitable, which, combined, warhol, s, films, with, the, band, s, music, which, made, use, of, minimalist, devices, such, as, drones, warhol, included, the, band, with, his, show, in, an, effort, to, use, rock, as, a, part, of, a, larger, interdisciplinary, art, work, based, around, performance, mcdonald, they, played, shows, for, several, months, in, new, york, city, then, traveled, throughout, the, united, states, and, canada, until, its, last, installment, in, may, 1967, during, a, short, period, in, september, 1966, when, cale, was, ill, the, avant, garde, musician, henry, flynt, and, reed, s, friend, richard, mishkin, took, turns, to, cover, for, him, the, show, included, 16, mm, film, projections, by, warhol, combined, with, a, stroboscopic, light, show, designed, by, danny, williams, because, of, the, punishing, lights, the, band, took, to, wearing, sunglasses, onstage, early, promo, posters, referred, to, the, group, as, the, erupting, plastic, inevitable, this, soon, changed, to, the, exploding, plastic, inevitable, in, 1966, maclise, temporarily, rejoined, the, velvet, underground, for, a, few, epi, shows, when, reed, was, suffering, from, hepatitis, and, unable, to, perform, for, these, appearances, cale, sang, and, played, organ, tucker, switched, to, bass, guitar, and, maclise, was, on, drums, also, at, these, appearances, the, band, often, played, an, extended, jam, they, had, dubbed, booker, t, after, musician, booker, t, jones, some, of, these, performances, have, been, released, as, a, bootleg, they, remain, the, only, record, of, maclise, with, the, velvet, underground, according, to, morrison, maclise, is, said, to, have, regretted, leaving, the, velvet, underground, and, wanted, to, rejoin, but, reed, specifically, prohibited, this, and, made, it, clear, that, this, stint, was, only, temporary, maclise, still, behaved, eccentrically, with, time, and, commerce, and, went, by, his, own, clock, for, instance, he, showed, up, half, an, hour, late, to, one, show, and, carried, on, with, a, half, hour, of, drumming, to, compensate, for, his, late, arrival, long, after, the, set, had, finished, in, december, 1966,

were, settled, by, which, time, the, record, had, lost, its, modest, commercial, momentum, and, the, still, was, airbrushed, out, of, the, remaining, copies, of, the, album, by, the, time, the, record, was, re, distributed, into, stores, it, faced, stiff, competition, in, the, marketplace, the, album, was, re, distributed, at, nearly, the, same, time, as, sgt, pepper, s, lonely, hearts, club, band, in, june, 1967, which, further, hindered, the, release, regarding, mgm, verve, s, delay, in, releasing, the, album, warhol, s, business, manager, paul, morrissey, once, offered, the, following, verve, mgm, didn, t, know, what, to, do, with, the, velvet, underground, and, nico, because, it, was, so, peculiar, they, did, not, release, it, for, almost, a, year, tom, wilson, at, verve, mgm, only, bought, the, album, from, me, because, of, nico, he, saw, no, talent, in, lou, in, 1982, brian, eno, said, that, while, the, album, sold, only, 30, 000, copies, in, its, early, years, everyone, who, bought, one, of, those, 30, 000, copies, started, a, band, filmmaker, and, music, writer, grant, mcphee, conducted, a, 2021, investigation, into, eno, s, famous, claim, into, the, popularity, of, the, band, s, first, album, and, concluded, that, it, may, have, sold, as, many, as, 200, 000, copies, by, 1971, alone, nico, moved, on, after, the, velvets, severed, their, relationship, with, andy, warhol, reed, once, commented, on, their, leaving, warhol, he, sat, down, and, had, a, talk, with, me, you, gotta, decide, what, you, want, to, do, do, you, want, to, keep, just, playing, museums, from, now, on, and, the, art, festivals, or, do, you, want, to, start, moving, into, other, areas, lou, don, t, you, think, you, should, think, about, it, so, i, thought, about, it, and, i, fired, him, because, i, thought, that, was, one, of, the, things, to, do, if, we, were, going, to, move, away, from, that, steve, sesnick, was, soon, brought, in, as, a, replacement, manager, much, to, the, chagrin, of, cale, who, believes, that, sesnick, tried, to, push, reed, as, band, leader, at, the, expense, of, band, harmony, both, cale, and, reed, called, sesnick, a, snake, in, different, interviews, after, leaving, the, band, in, september, 1967, the, velvet, underground, began, recording, their, second, album, white, light, white, heat, with, tom, wilson, as, producer, the, band, performed, live, often, and, their, performances, became, louder, and, harsher, and, often, included, extended, improvisations, warhol, arranged, for, the, band, to, get, an, endorsement, deal, with, vox, to, enable, them, to, use, vox, equipment, including, special, effects, pedals, and, an, organ, for, free, sterling, morrison, believed, they, were, the, first, american, band, to, get, a, vox, endorsement, sterling, morrison, offered, the, following, input, regarding, the, recording, there, was, fantastic, leakage, cause, everyone, was, playing, so, loud, and, we, had, so, much, electronic, junk, with, us, in, the, studio, all, these, fuzzers, and, compressors, gary, kellgren, who, is, ultra, competent, told, us, repeatedly, you, can, t, do, it, all, the, needles, are, on, red, and, we, reacted, as, we, always, reacted, look, we, don, t, know, what, goes, on, in, there, and, we, don, t, want, to, hear, about, it, just, do, the, best, you, can, and, so, the, album, is, fuzzy, there, s, all, that, white, noise, we, wanted, to, do, something, electronic, and, energetic, we, had, the, energy, and, the, electronics, but, we, didn, t, know, it, couldn, t, be, recorded, what, we, were, trying, to, do, was, really, fry, the, tracks, cale, has, said, that, while, the, debut, had, some, moments, of, fragility, and, beauty, white, light, white, heat, was, consciously, anti, beauty, the, title, track, sets, a, harsh, opening, bassist, cale, overdubbing, a, piano, that, has, been, described, as, a, cross, between, jerry, lee, lewis, and, henry, cowell, along, with, brash, songs, like, sister, ray, and, i, heard, her, call, my, name, there, was, the, darkly, comic, the, gift, a, short, story, written, by, reed, and, narrated, by, cale, in, his, deadpan, welsh, accent, the, meditative, here, she, comes, now, was, later, covered, by, galaxie, 500, cabaret, voltaire, and, nirvana, among, others, the, album, was, released, on, january, 30, 1968, entering, the, billboard, top, 200, chart, for, two, weeks, at, number, 199, tensions, were, growing, the, group, was, tired, of, receiving, little, recognition, for, its, work, and, reed, and, cale, were, pulling, the, velvet, underground, in, different, directions, the, differences, showed, in, the, last, recording, sessions, the, band, had, with, john, cale, in, 1968, three, pop, like, songs, in, reed, s, direction, temptation, inside, your, heart, stephanie, says, and, beginning, to, see, the, light, and, a, viola, driven, drone, in, cale, s, direction, hey, mr, rain, further, some, songs, the, band, had, performed, with, cale, in, concert, or, that, he, had, co, written, were, not, recorded, until, after, he, had, left, the, group, such, as, walk, it, and, talk, it, ride, into, the, sun, and, countess, from, hong, kong, reed, called, morrison, and, tucker, to, a, meeting, at, the, riviera, cafe, in, the, west, village, without, cale, s, knowledge, and, informed, them, that, cale, was, out, of, the, band, when, morrison, objected, reed, said, it, was, either, cale, was, sacked, or, the, velvets, were, dissolved, neither, morrison, nor, tucker, was, happy, with, the, idea, but, faced, with, a, choice, of, either, no, cale, or, no, band, at, all, the, pair, reluctantly, sided, with, reed, it, has, often, been, reported, that, before, cale, s, departure, following, white, light, white, heat, there, was, a, struggle, between, his, creative, impulses, and, reed, s, cale, s, experimentalist, tendencies, had, contrasted, with, reed, s, more, conventional, approach, according, to, tim, mitchell, however, morrison, reported, that, while, there, was, creative, tension, between, reed, and, cale, its, effects, have, been, exaggerated, over, the, years, cale, played, his, last, show, with, the, band, at, the, boston, tea, party, in, september, 1968, and, was, fired, shortly, afterwards, according, to, michael, carlucci, a, friend, of, robert, quine, lou, told, quine, that, the, reason, why, he, had, to, get, rid, of, cale, in, the, band, was, cale, s, ideas, were, just, too, out, there, cale, had, some, wacky, ideas, he, wanted, to, record, the, next, album, with, the, amplifiers, underwater, and, just, couldn, t, have, it, he, was, trying, to, make, the, band, more, accessible, ultimately, morrison, was, dispatched, by, reed, to, tell, cale, that, he, was, out, of, the, band, before, work, on, their, third, album, started, cale, was, replaced, by, musician, doug, yule, of, the, boston, group, the, grass, menagerie, who, had, been, a, close, associate, of, the, band, yule, a, native, new, yorker, had, moved, to, boston, to, attend, boston, university, as, a, theater, major, but, left, the, program, after, one, year, to, continue, playing, music, yule, had, first, seen, the, velvets, perform, at, a, student, event, at, harvard, university, in, cambridge, in, early, 1968, and, when, the, band, played, at, the, boston, tea, party, later, that, year, the, band, stayed, at, yule, s, apartment, on, river, street, which, he, happened, to, be, renting, from, their, road, manager, hans, onsager, who, worked, closely, with, their, manager, steve, sesnick, it, was, during, this, period, that, morrison, heard, yule, playing, guitar, in, his, apartment, and, mentioned, to, reed, that, yule, was, practicing, guitar, and, was, improving, quickly, it, was, following, this, discussion, that, led, to, a, phone, call, from, steve, sesnick, inviting, yule, to, meet, with, the, band, at, max, s, kansas, city, in, new, york, city, in, october, 1968, to, discuss, joining, the, velvets, before, two, upcoming, shows, in, cleveland, ohio, at, the, club, la, cave, upon, meeting, reed, sesnick, and, morrison, at, max, s, yule, was, asked, to, handle, bass, and, organ, duties, in, the, band, and, he, would, soon, contribute, vocals, as, well, after, several, months, of, shows, in, the, us, the, band, swiftly, recorded, their, third, album, the, velvet, underground, in, late, 1968, at, ttg, studios, in, hollywood, california, it, was, released, in, march, 1969, the, cover, photograph, was, taken, by, billy, name, the, lp, sleeve, was, designed, by, dick, smith, then, a, staff, artist, at, mgm, verve, released, on, march, 12, 1969, the, album, failed, to, make, billboard, s, top, 200, album, chart, the, harsh, abrasive, tendencies, on, the, first, two, records, were, almost, entirely, absent, on, their, third, album, this, resulted, in, a, gentler, sound, influenced, by, folk, music, prescient, of, the, songwriting, style, that, would, soon, form, reed, s, solo, career, while, reed, had, covered, a, vast, range, of, lyrical, subjects, on, the, first, two, velvet, underground, albums, the, lyrical, themes, of, the, third, album, were, more, intimate, in, nature, reed, s, songwriting, also, covered, new, emotional, ground, as, well, as, heard, in, the, songs, pale, blue, eyes, jesus, beginning, to, see, the, light, and, i, m, set, free, the, personal, tone, of, the, album, s, subject, matter, resulted, in, reed, s, desire, to, create, a, closet, mix, that, boosted, the, vocals, to, the, forefront, while, reducing, the, album, s, instrumentation, the, second, and, more, widely, distributed, mix, is, the, stereo, mix, done, by, mgm, verve, staff, recording, engineer, val, valentin, another, factor, in, the, change, of, sound, was, the, band, s, vox, amplifiers, and, assorted, fuzzboxes, were, rumored, to, have, been, stolen, from, an, airport, while, they, were, on, tour, and, they, obtained, replacements, by, signing, a, new, endorsement, deal, with, sunn, in, addition, reed, and, morrison, had, purchased, matching, fender, 12, string, electric, guitars, but, doug, yule, plays, down, the, influence, of, the, new, equipment, morrison, s, ringing, guitar, parts, and, yule, s, melodic, bass, guitar, and, harmony, vocals, are, used, prominently, on, the, album, reed, s, songs, and, singing, are, subdued, and, confessional, in, nature, and, he, shared, lead, vocals, with, yule, particularly, when, his, own, voice, would, fail, under, stress, doug, yule, sang, the, lead, vocal, on, candy, says, about, the, warhol, superstar, candy, darling, which, opens, the, lp, and, a, rare, moe, tucker, lead, vocal, is, used, on, after, hours, which, closes, the, album, because, reed, felt, her, innocent, voice, was, more, believable, for, a, sad, song, the, album, contains, the, experimental, track, the, murder, mystery, which, utilized, all, four, band, members, reed, yule, tucker, and, morrison, reading, different, lyrics, sometimes, simultaneously, as, well, as, the, ballad, pale, blue, eyes, the, velvet, underground, spent, much, of, 1969, on, the, road, both, in, the, us, and, canada, and, not, making, much, headway, commercially, despite, these, commercial, setbacks, the, band, focused, on, performing, live, shows, on, the, road, playing, both, re, worked, songs, from, their, past, albums, and, debuting, new, songs, that, would, find, their, way, onto, the, loaded, album, such, as, new, age, rock, and, roll, and, sweet, jane, while, the, band, continued, to, do, extended, improvisations, in, their, live, shows, by, 1969, they, were, focusing, on, tight, live, performances, and, several, of, the, live, shows, the, band, played, during, this, period, would, end, up, released, as, live, albums, many, years, later, the, live, album, 1969, the, velvet, underground, live, with, reed, yule, morrison, tucker, was, recorded, in, october, 1969, but, not, released, until, 1974, on, mercury, records, at, the, urging, of, rock, critic, paul, nelson, who, worked, in, a, r, for, mercury, at, the, time, nelson, asked, singer, songwriter, elliott, murphy, to, write, liner, notes, for, the, double, album, in, his, notes, murphy, described, a, scene, 100, years, in, the, future, with, a, student, taking, a, class, on, classical, rock, n, roll, and, listening, to, the, velvet, underground, he, wondered, what, the, student, would, make, of, the, music, and, concluded, i, wish, it, was, a, hundred, years, from, today, i, can, t, stand, the, suspense, during, this, period, the, band, played, a, series, of, shows, in, november, 1969, at, the, matrix, and, the, family, dog, venues, in, san, francisco, recordings, of, these, shows, were, released, in, 2001, as, a, triple, live, album, bootleg, series, volume, 1, the, quine, tapes, which, included, the, line, up, of, reed, yule, morrison, and, tucker, during, 1969, the, band, recorded, on, and, off, in, the, studio, creating, a, lot, of, promising, material, both, singles, and, one, offs, that, were, never, officially, released, at, the, time, due, to, disputes, with, their, record, label, what, many, consider, to, be, the, prime, songs, of, these, recording, sessions, were, released, years, later, in, 1985, in, a, compilation, album, called, vu, the, album, vu, marks, the, transitional, sound, between, the, whisper, soft, third, album, and, the, band, s, movement, to, the, later, pop, rock, song, style, of, their, final, record, loaded, two, of, the, songs, the, velvets, recorded, during, this, period, were, later, used, on, film, soundtracks, stephanie, says, was, used, in, the, 2001, film, the, royal, tenenbaums, i, m, sticking, with, you, has, a, rare, moe, tucker, lou, reed, dual, lead, vocal, track, with, doug, yule, accompanying, on, piano, and, was, included, in, the, film, juno, the, rest, of, the, recordings, as, well, as, some, alternative, takes, and, instrumental, tracks, were, later, bundled, on, another, view, which, was, released, in, 1986, after, reed, s, departure, he, later, reworked, a, number, of, these, songs, for, his, solo, records, over, the, years, stephanie, says, ocean, i, can, t, stand, it, lisa, says, and, andy, s, chest, as, well, as, she, s, my, best, friend, which, had, been, originally, sung, by, doug, yule, by, 1969, the, mgm, and, verve, record, labels, had, been, losing, money, for, several, years, a, new, president, mike, curb, was, hired, and, he, decided, to, cancel, the, recording, contracts, of, 18, of, their, acts, who, supposedly, glorified, drugs, in, their, lyrics, including, their, many, controversial, and, unprofitable, acts, the, drug, or, hippie, related, bands, were, released, from, mgm, nonetheless, mgm, insisted, on, retaining, ownership, of, all, master, tapes, of, their, recordings, and, according, to, an, mgm, representative, in, a, rolling, stone, article, from, 1970, it, wasn, t, eighteen, groups, was, misquoted, the, cuts, were, made, partly, to, do, with, the, drug, scene, like, maybe, a, third, of, them, had, to, do, with, drug, reasons, the, others, were, dropped, because, they, weren, t, selling, lou, reed, would, later, remark, in, the, 1987, issue, of, creem, that, while, he, did, not, believe, that, mgm, dropped, the, velvets, for, drug, associations, he, did, acknowledge, we, wanted, to, get, out, of, there, cotillion, records, a, subsidiary, of, atlantic, records, that, specialized, in, blues, and, southern, soul, signed, the, velvet, underground, for, what, would, be, its, final, studio, album, with, lou, reed, loaded, the, album, s, title, refers, to, atlantic, s, request, that, the, band, produce, an, album, loaded, with, hits, though, the, record, was, not, the, smash, hit, the, company, had, anticipated, it, contains, the, most, accessible, pop, the, velvet, underground, had, performed, and, two, of, reed, s, best, known, songs, sweet, jane, and, rock, and, roll, by, the, recording, of, loaded, doug, yule, played, a, more, prominent, role, in, the, band, and, with, reed, s, encouragement, sang, the, lead, vocal, on, four, songs, who, loves, the, sun, which, opened, the, album, new, age, lonesome, cowboy, bill, and, the, final, track, oh, sweet, nuthin, yule, once, commented, on, the, recording, of, loaded, lou, leaned, on, me, a, lot, in, terms, of, musical, support, and, for, harmonies, vocal, arrangements, i, did, a, lot, on, loaded, it, sort, of, devolved, down, to, the, lou, and, doug, recreational, recording, while, the, third, velvets, lp, was, recorded, mostly, live, in, a, collaborative, atmosphere, the, bulk, of, loaded, was, crafted, in, the, studio, in, addition, to, handling, all, the, bass, and, piano, duties, on, loaded, yule, also, contributed, several, lead, guitar, parts, and, played, drums, on, five, of, the, album, s, ten, tracks, most, notably, on, the, songs, rock, and, roll, and, sweet, jane, since, moe, tucker, who, was, erroneously, credited, as, the, album, s, drummer, despite, not, playing, on, it, was, absent, on, maternity, leave, to, have, her, first, child, a, daughter, named, kerry, other, drum, parts, were, performed, by, engineer, adrian, barber, session, musician, tommy, castanaro, and, billy, yule, doug, yule, s, younger, brother, who, was, still, in, high, school, at, the, time, during, the, sessions, sterling, morrison, resumed, his, undergraduate, studies, at, the, city, college, of, new, york, although, he, contributed, guitar, tracks, to, the, album, he, began, to, split, his, time, between, classes, the, sessions, and, the, gigs, at, max, s, thus, leaving, reed, and, yule, to, handle, the, bulk, of, the, arrangements, it, was, during, the, loaded, recording, sessions, that, the, velvets, with, billy, yule, deputizing, on, drums, secured, a, now, legendary, nine, week, residency, from, june, 24, august, 28, 1970, at, the, new, york, nightclub, max, s, kansas, city, playing, two, lengthy, sets, per, night, and, showcasing, altered, arrangements, of, older, songs, from, their, previous, albums,

years, later, in, 1972, as, live, at, max, s, kansas, city, also, on, atlantic, records, disillusioned, with, the, lack, of, progress, the, band, was, making, and, facing, pressure, by, manager, steve, sesnick, reed, decided, to, quit, the, band, during, the, last, week, of, the, max, s, kansas, city, shows, in, august, 1970, although, reed, had, informed, tucker, who, was, attending, the, show, but, not, playing, with, the, band, because, of, her, pregnancy, that, he, planned, to, leave, the, group, on, his, last, evening, he, did, not, tell, morrison, or, yule, in, a, 2006, interview, yule, said, sesnick, waited, until, one, hour, before, the, band, was, scheduled, to, take, the, stage, the, following, night, before, notifying, him, that, reed, was, not, coming, i, was, expecting, to, show, up, i, thought, he, was, late, yule, blamed, sesnick, for, reed, s, departure, sesnick, had, engineered, lou, s, leaving, the, group, he, and, lou, had, a, relationship, where, lou, had, depended, on, him, for, moral, support, and, he, trusted, him, and, sesnick, basically, said, screw, you, it, must, have, been, hard, for, lou, to, hear, that, because, he, depended, on, him, so, he, quit, while, loaded, was, finalized, and, mixed, it, had, yet, to, be, mastered, and, was, not, set, to, be, released, by, atlantic, until, november, of, that, year, reed, often, said, he, was, completely, surprised, when, he, saw, loaded, in, stores, he, also, said, i, left, them, to, their, album, full, of, hits, that, i, made, reed, was, perturbed, about, a, verse, being, edited, from, the, loaded, version, of, sweet, jane, new, age, was, changed, as, well, as, originally, recorded, its, closing, line, it, s, the, beginning, of, a, new, age, as, sung, by, yule, was, repeated, many, more, times, a, brief, interlude, in, rock, and, roll, was, also, removed, for, the, 1995, box, set, peel, slowly, and, see, the, album, was, presented, as, reed, intended, the, fully, loaded, two, disc, edition, includes, the, full, versions, of, sweet, jane, and, new, age, on, the, other, hand, yule, has, pointed, out, that, the, album, was, for, all, intents, and, purposes, finished, when, reed, left, the, band, and, that, reed, had, been, aware, of, most, if, not, all, of, the, edits, with, manager, steve, sesnick, looking, to, fill, bookings, following, the, departure, of, lou, reed, and, with, the, pending, release, of, loaded, in, november, 1970, the, band, now, with, sterling, morrison, on, guitar, moe, tucker, on, drums, walter, powers, on, bass, and, doug, yule, taking, over,

university, of, texas, at, austin, he, had, packed, an, empty, suitcase, and, when, the, time, came, for, the, band, to, return, to, new, york, city, he, told, them, at, the, airport, that, he, was, staying, in, texas, and, quitting, the, band, the, last, founding, member, to, quit, morrison, s, replacement, was, singer, keyboard, player, willie, alexander, this, brief, line, up, of, the, band,

underground, in, europe, sesnick, was, able, to, secure, a, single, album, deal, with, polydor, in, the, uk, and, a, handful, of, promotional, shows, were, booked, in, the, uk, in, november, and, december, 1972, after, sesnick, reached, out, to, yule, a, new, velvet, underground, lineup, was, quickly, assembled, by, yule, to, do, the, uk, shows, this, brief, lineup, of, the, velvet, underground, consisted, of, yule, guitarist, rob, norris, later, of, the, bongos, bassist, george, kay, krzyzewski, and, drummer, mark, nauseef, after, sesnick, failed, to, show, up, in, london, to, meet, the, band, with, the, necessary, equipment, and, tour, funds, they, played, the, handful, of, dates, to, secure, enough, money, for, flights, back, to, the, us, and, yule, left, the, band, when, the, brief, tour, ended, in, december, 1972, it, was, during, this, brief, period, in, the, uk, that, yule, recorded, the, polydor, album, ultimately, titled, squeeze, under, the, velvet, underground, name, virtually, by, himself, with, only, the, assistance, of, deep, purple, drummer, ian, paice, and, a, few, other, session, musicians, in, an, unspecified, london, studio, while, yule, intended, to, recruit, moe, tucker, to, play, drums, on, squeeze, and, the, handful, of, promotional, shows, sesnick, vetoed, his, decision, and, claimed, she, was, too, expensive, to, hire, yule, was, also, prevented, by, sesnick, to, participate, in, the, mixing, of, the, album, s, tracks, prior, to, the, album, s, release, the, following, year, squeeze, was, released, in, february, the, following, year, 1973, in, europe, only, with, minimal, promotion, by, the, label, and, was, held, in, low, regard, by, fans, and, critics, stephen, thomas, erlewine, notes, that, the, album, received, uniformly, terrible, reviews, upon, initial, release, and, in, the, early, 1970s, the, nme, book, of, rock, counted, it, as, a, velvet, underground, album, in, name, only, when, asked, about, squeeze, yule, hinted, that, band, manager, steve, sesnick, orchestrated, the, album, purely, as, a, money, ploy, sesnick, dumped, the, second, iteration, of, the, band, in, england, with, no, money, and, no, equipment, and, just, left, us, there, to, find, our, way, back, he, gave, me, six, copies, of, squeeze, as, pay, i, never, got, any, money, when, you, sign, with, ascap, or, bmi, you, get, an, advance, he, not, only, made, an, arrangement, with, them, but, actually, signed, as, me, and, took, the, money, despite, the, negative, reviews, of, the, album, upon, its, initial, release, in, recent, years, the, album, has, been, revisited, by, both, critics, and, musicians, with, more, sympathetic, and, favorable, reviews, in, 2011, music, writer, steven, shehori, included, squeeze, in, his, criminally, overlooked, albums, series, for, the, huffington, post, and, in, a, lengthy, review, of, the, album, offered, the, following, positive, assessment, of, squeeze, if, you, pluck, it, from, the, shackles, of, its, murky, back, story, squeeze, is, nothing, short, of, a, quintessential, listening, experience, the, uk, band, squeeze, took, their, name, from, its, title, according, to, band, member, chris, difford, who, offered, the, following, opinion, of, the, album, in, a, 2012, interview, it, s, an, odd, record, but, the, name, came, from, that, definitely, in, a, retrospective, way, i, really, enjoy, it, it, has, kind, of, a, naivety, about, it, although, yule, had, put, an, end, to, the, velvet, underground, in, late, 1972, a, band, with, him, billy, yule, george, kay, and, guitarist, don, silverman, later, known, as, noor, khan, was, incorrectly, billed, as, the, velvet, underground, for, two, shows, in, boston, and, long, island, the, band, members, objected, to, the, billing, instigated, by, their, tour, manager, according, to, yule, the, promoter, was, not, supposed, to, bill, the, band, as, the, velvet, underground, in, late, may, 1973, the, band, and, the, tour, manager, parted, ways, thus, bringing, the, velvet, underground, to, an, end, until, the, classic, line, up, of, reed, tucker, morrison, and, cale, reunited, in, the, 1990s, reed, cale, and, nico, teamed, up, at, the, beginning, of, 1972, to, play, a, concert, in, paris, at, the, bataclan, club, this, concert, was, bootlegged, and, finally, received, an, official, release, as, le,

of, the, 1989, velvet, revolution, which, ended, more, than, 40, years, of, communist, rule, in, czechoslovakia, to, the, band, reed, pointed, out, that, the, name, velvet, revolution, derives, from, its, peaceful, nature, that, no, one, was, actually, hurt, during, those, events, reed, has, also, given, at, least, one, radio, interview, where, he, stated, that, it, was, called, the, velvet, revolution, because, all, of, the, dissidents, were, listening, to, the, velvet, underground, leading, up, to, the, overthrow, and, this, music, was, an, inspiration, for, the, events, that, followed, after, havel, s, election, as, president, first, of, czechoslovakia, and, then, the, czech, republic, reed, visited, him, in, prague, on, september, 16, 1998, at, havel, s, request, reed, performed,
