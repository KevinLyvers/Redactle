role, of, prime, minister, becoming, responsible, for, appointing, advancements, favors, and, dismissals, and, contributing, in, domestic, and, foreign, politics, in, 1755, she, was, approached, by, wenzel, anton, prince, of, kaunitz, rietberg, a, prominent, austrian, diplomat, asking, her, to, intervene, in, the, negotiations, which, led, to, the, treaty, of, versailles, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, diplomatic, revolution, which, saw, france, allied, to, their, former, enemy, austria, under, these, changed, alliances, the, european, powers, entered, the, seven, years, war, which, saw, france, austria, and, russia, pitted, against, britain, and, prussia, france, suffered, a, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, prussians, in, the, battle, of, rossbach, in, 1757, and, eventually, lost, the, american, colonies, to, the, british, after, rossbach, madame, de, pompadour, is, alleged, to, have, comforted, the, king, with, the, now, famous, au, reste, apr, s, nous, le, d, luge, besides, after, us, the, deluge, france, emerged, from, the, war, diminished, and, virtually, bankrupt, madame, de, pompadour, persisted, in, her, support, of, these, policies, and, when, cardinal, de, bernis, failed, her, she, brought, choiseul, into, office, and, supported, and, guided, him, in, all, his, plans, the, pacte, de, famille, the, suppression, of, the, jesuits, and, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, britain, s, victories, in, the, war, had, allowed, it, to, surpass, france, as, the, leading, colonial, power, something, which, was, commonly, blamed, on, pompadour, pompadour, protected, the, physiocrates, school, its, leader, was, quesnay, her, own, doctor, which, paved, the, way, for, adam, smith, s, theories, she, also, defended, the, encyclop, die, edited, by, denis, diderot, and, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, against, those, among, them, the, archbishop, of, paris, christophe, de, beaumont, who, sought, to, have, it, suppressed, in, diderot, s, first, novel, les, bijoux, indiscrets, the, indiscreet, jewels, the, characters, of, mangogul, and, mirzoza, are, allegories, of, louis, xv, and, pompadour, respectively, diderot, portrayed, pompadour, in, a, flattering, light, most, likely, to, ensure, her, support, for, encyclopedie, pompadour, had, a, copy, of, les, bijoux, indiscrets, in, her, library, which, may, explain, why, the, crown, did, not, pursue, diderot, for, such, an, indiscretion, against, the, king, the, marquise, had, many, enemies, among, the, royal, courtiers, who, felt, it, a, disgrace, that, the, king, would, thus, compromise, himself, with, a, commoner, she, was, very, sensitive, to, the, unending, libels, called, poissonnades, analogous, to, mazarinade, against, cardinal, mazarin, and, a, pun, on, her, family, name, poisson, which, means, fish, in, french, only, with, great, reluctance, did, louis, take, punitive, action, against, her, known, enemies, such, as, louis, fran, ois, armand, du, plessis, duc, de, richelieu, madame, de, pompadour, was, able, to, wield, such, influence, at, court, due, to, the, invaluable, role, she, played, as, a, friend, and, confidante, of, the, king, in, opposition, to, previous, mistresses, of, louis, xv, pompadour, made, herself, invaluable, to, the, king, by, becoming, the, only, person, whom, louis, trusted, and, who, could, be, counted, on, to, tell, him, the, truth, pompadour, was, an, indispensable, comfort, to, louis, who, was, prone, to, melancholy, and, boredom, she, alone, was, able, to, captivate, and, amuse, him, and, would, entertain, louis, with, elegant, private, parties, and, operas, afternoons, of, hunting, and, journeying, among, their, various, chateaux, and, lodgings, she, would, sometimes, even, invite, his, wife, queen, marie, leszczy, ska, with, his, help, around, 1750, madame, de, pompadour, s, role, as, friend, of, the, king, became, her, solitary, role, as, she, ceased, her, sexual, relationship, with, the, king, the, end, of, this, sexual, relationship, was, in, part, attributed, to, pompadour, s, poor, health, as, she, suffered, the, aftereffects, of, whooping, cough, recurring, colds, and, bronchitis, spitting, blood, headaches, three, miscarriages, to, the, king, as, well, as, an, unconfirmed, case, of, leucorrhoea, in, addition, pompadour, admitted, to, having, the, misfortune, to, be, of, a, very, cold, temperament, and, attempts, to, increase, her, libido, with, a, diet, of, truffles, celery, and, vanilla, were, unsuccessful, furthermore, in, 1750, the, jubilee, year, placed, pressure, upon, the, king, to, repent, of, his, sins, and, renounce, his, mistress, in, order, to, cement, her, continuing, importance, as, favourite, in, the, face, of, these, impediments, pompadour, took, on, the, role, of, friend, of, the, king, which, she, announced, through, artistic, patronage, pompadour, s, announcement, was, most, prominently, declared, through, her, commission, from, jean, baptiste, pigalle, of, a, sculpture, representing, herself, as, amiti, offering, herself, to, a, now, lost, pendant, sculpture, of, louis, xv, pompadour, also, had, a, related, sculpture, depicted, in, a, portrait, of, herself, painted, by, fran, ois, boucher, in, 1759, built, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, ch, teau, de, saint, ouen, near, paris, in, the, seine, saint, denis, department, has, belonged, to, the, prestigious, dukes, of, gesvres, until, its, destruction, in, 1821, to, build, the, actual, ch, teau, for, the, comtesse, du, cayla, after, the, sale, of, her, ch, teau, de, cr, cy, unexpectedly, the, marquise, de, pompadour, did, not, purchase, saint, ouen, but, benefited, from, the, usufruct, of, this, residence, from, 1759, until, her, death, in, 1764, the, plan, of, the, ch, teau, originally, designed, by, antoine, lepautre, was, a, classical, u, shape, and, consisted, of, a, long, fa, ade, with, two, wings, prolonging, the, main, body, facing, the, river, seine, on, the, garden, side, saint, ouen, s, originality, resided, in, its, interior, distribution, the, main, body, consisted, of, a, succession, of, three, salons, l, italienne, whose, decoration, was, entirely, modified, by, the, slodtz, family, in, the, 1750s, for, the, gesvres, family, in, french, architecture, a, salon, l, italienne, is, a, room, filling, all, the, height, of, a, building, a, memorable, example, is, the, grand, salon, at, vaux, le, vicomte, in, addition, to, this, layout, as, soon, as, madame, de, pompadour, acquired, the, estate, a, vast, project, of, reorganisation, of, the, entire, buildings, including, stables, and, dependences, was, planned, costing, more, than, 500, 000, livres, in, the, absence, of, the, original, plans, a, restitution, of, the, ground, floor, has, been, proposed, it, seems, that, the, architect, who, supervised, this, reorganisation, was, ange, jacques, gabriel, who, at, that, time, directed, all, the, renovation, and, building, works, of, the, different, residences, of, mme, de, pompadour, using, the, central, salon, l, italienne, as, a, pivot, an, apartment, was, created, for, the, king, as, a, counterpart, to, that, of, the, henceforth, duchesse, de, pompadour, making, the, prestigious, ch, teau, de, saint, ouen, into, a, reflection, of, her, own, status, a, symbol, of, her, social, and, political, achievements, despite, misconceptions, perpetuated, by, her, contemporaries, and, much, of, historical, discourse, pompadour, did, not, supplement, her, role, as, mistress, by, employing, replacement, lovers, for, the, king, following, the, cessation, of, pompadour, s, sexual, relationship, with, louis, the, king, met, with, young, women, in, a, house, in, versailles, established, particularly, for, that, purpose, called, the, parc, aux, cerfs, or, stag, park, it, was, not, as, often, described, a, harem, it, was, occupied, by, only, one, woman, at, a, time, pompadour, was, not, involved, other, than, to, accept, it, as, a, necessity, pompadour, s, only, contribution, to, the, stag, park, was, to, accept, it, as, a, favorable, alternative, to, a, rival, at, court, as, she, stated, it, is, his, heart, i, want, all, these, little, girls, with, no, education, will, not, take, it, from, me, i, would, not, be, so, calm, if, i, saw, some, pretty, woman, of, the, court, or, the, capital, trying, to, conquer, it, madame, de, pompadour, was, an, influential, patron, of, the, arts, who, played, a, central, role, in, making, paris, the, perceived, capital, of, taste, and, culture, in, europe, she, attained, this, influence, through, the, appointment, of, her, guardian, charles, fran, ois, paul, le, normant, de, tournehem, and, later, her, brother, abel, fran, ois, poisson, in, the, post, of, directeur, g, n, ral, des, b, timents, which, controlled, government, policy, and, expenditures, for, the, arts, she, championed, french, pride, by, constructing, and, later, outright, buying, a, porcelain, factory, at, s, vres, in, 1759, which, became, one, of, the, most, famous, porcelain, manufacturers, in, europe, and, which, provided, skilled, jobs, for, the, region, numerous, sculptors, and, portrait, painters, were, patronized, by, pompadour, among, them, the, court, artist, jean, marc, nattier, in, the, 1750s, fran, ois, boucher, jean, baptiste, r, veillon, and, fran, ois, hubert, drouais, she, patronized, jacques, guay, the, gemstone, engraver, who, taught, her, to, engrave, in, onyx, jasper, and, other, semi, precious, stones, pompadour, greatly, influenced, and, stimulated, innovation, in, what, is, known, as, the, rococo, style, in, the, fine, and, decorative, arts, for, example, through, her, patronage, of, the, artists, like, boucher, and, the, constant, refurnishing, of, the, fifteen, residences, she, held, with, louis, like, pompadour, this, style, was, critiqued, by, some, as, a, pernicious, feminine, influence, despite, the, fact, that, it, was, embraced, by, many, men, as, well, as, women, however, it, is, also, widely, recognised, that, madame, de, pompadour, engaged, with, prominent, artists, as, a, way, to, capture, the, attention, of, the, king, whilst, cultivating, her, public, image, the, oil, sketch, of, pompadour, s, lost, portrait, by, boucher, sits, in, the, starhemberg, room, at, waddesdon, manor, built, by, baron, ferdinand, de, rothschild, surrounded, by, s, vres, porcelain, another, industry, that, she, greatly, influenced, and, innovated, through, personal, dissemination, across, an, international, network, of, her, own, clientele, in, addition, to, supporting, the, arts, as, a, patron, pompadour, also, participated, in, them, more, directly, besides, being, one, of, the, few, 18th, century, practitioners, of, gem, engraving, she, was, an, acclaimed, stage, actress, in, plays, staged, at, her, private, theaters, at, versailles, and, bellevue, some, of, the, artworks, made, under, pompadour, s, purview, by, other, hands, notably, the, 1758, portrait, by, boucher, of, mme, de, pompadour, at, her, toilette, can, be, viewed, as, collaborations, with, pompadour, madame, de, pompadour, is, considered, an, amateur, printmaker, who, made, print, engravings, with, the, help, of, boucher, she, had, engraving, equipment, to, create, the, prints, of, works, by, boucher, and, guay, brought, within, her, personal, apartments, in, versailles, her, political, mind, also, can, be, attributed, to, her, great, book, collection, she, collected, influential, books, such, as, the, history, of, the, stuarts, printed, in, 1760, with, her, own, printing, press, which, can, be, determined, through, the, stamp, markings, of, her, arms, located, on, the, cover, baron, ferdinand, de, rothschild, an, avid, 19th, century, collector, in, london, and, waddesdon, manor, collected, a, number, of, her, books, including, this, previously, mentioned, book, and, a, copy, of, her, published, catalogue, of, books, from, 1764, which, lists, her, entire, collection, madame, de, pompadour, created, 52, engraved, prints, of, drawings, by, boucher, after, gemstone, engravings, by, guay, her, collection, of, work, in, book, form, is, titled, suite, d, estampes, grav, es, par, madame, la, marquise, de, pompadour, d, apres, les, pierres, grav, es, de, guay, graveur, du, roy, which, in, english, is, series, of, prints, engraved, by, madame, la, marquise, de, pompadour, after, the, engraved, stones, of, guay, engraver, of, the, king, the, personal, portfolio, of, madame, de, pompadour, was, found, in, the, walters, art, museum, manuscript, room, by, art, historian, susan, wager, some, art, historians, argue, whether, or, not, she, should, be, considered, a, collaborator, with, the, artists, under, her, patronage, since, there, is, no, documentation, of, how, much, pompadour, might, have, contributed, to, the, works, whose, idea, and, whose, composition, will, remain, a, mystery, louis, xv, remained, devoted, to, pompadour, until, her, death, from, tuberculosis, in, 1764, at, the, age, of, 42, louis, nursed, her, through, her, illness, even, her, enemies, admired, her, courage, during, the, final, painful, weeks, voltaire, wrote, i, am, very, sad, at, the, death, of, madame, de, pompadour, i, was, indebted, to, her, and, i, mourn, her, out, of, gratitude, it, seems, absurd, that, while, an, ancient, pen, pusher, hardly, able, to, walk, should, still, be, alive, a, beautiful, woman, in, the, midst, of, a, splendid, career, should, die, at, the, age, of, forty, two, many, of, her, enemies, were, however, greatly, relieved, looking, at, the, rain, during, the, departure, of, his, mistress, s, coffin, from, versailles, the, devastated, king, reportedly, said, la, marquise, n, aura, pas, de, beau, temps, pour, son, voyage, the, marquise, will, not, have, good, weather, for, her, journey, she, was, buried, at, the, couvent, des, capucines, in, paris, madame, de, pompadour, has, been, depicted, on, screen, in, film, and, television, on, many, occasions, beginning, in, 1924, with, paulette, duval, opposite, rudolph, valentino, in, monsieur, beaucaire, a, biopic, came, out, three, years, later, called, madame, pompadour, directed, by, herbert, wilcox, in, which, she, was, played, by, dorothy, gish, other, actresses, to, have, played, her, include
