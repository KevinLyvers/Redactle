held, paris, the, legislative, assembly, had, no, choice, but, to, suspend, louis, xvi, and, replace, him, with, a, provisional, executive, council, of, six, members, composed, of, former, girondin, ministers, roland, in, the, interior, servan, in, the, war, clavi, re, in, finance, monge, in, the, navy, and, lebrun, in, foreign, affairs, the, girondins, hostile, to, revolutionary, paris, needed,

punished, with, death, the, tocsin, we, are, about, to, ring, is, not, an, alarm, signal, it, sounds, the, charge, on, the, enemies, of, our, country, he, continued, after, the, applause, to, conquer, them, we, must, dare, dare, again, always, dare, and, france, is, saved, his, speech, acted, as, a, call, for, direct, action, among, the, citizens, as, well, as, a, strike, against, the, external, enemy, many, believe, this, speech, was, responsible, for, inciting, the, september, massacres, it, is, estimated, that, around, 1, 100, 1, 600, people, were, murdered, madame, roland, held, danton, responsible, for, their, deaths, danton, was, also, accused, by, the, french, historians, adolphe, thiers, alphonse, de, lamartine, jules, michelet, louis, blanc, and, edgar, quinet, however, according, to, albert, soboul, there, is, no, proof, that, the, massacres, were, organized, by, danton, or, by, anyone, else, though, it, is, certain, that, he, did, nothing, to, stop, them, he, did, intervene, however, in, protecting, roland, and, brissot, from, an, arrest, warrant, from, the, supervisory, committee, of, the, commune, on, 4, september, opposing, marat, by, having, the, mandates, removed, and, was, complicit, in, the, escape, of, adrien, duport, talleyrand, and, charles, de, lameth, on, 6, september, he, was, elected, by, his, section, th, tre, fran, ais, to, be, a, deputy, for, the, convention, gathering, on, 22, september, danton, remained, a, member, of, the, ministry, although, holding, both, positions, simultaneously, was, illegal, danton, robespierre, and, marat, were, accused, of, forming, a, triumvirate, on, 26, september, danton, was, forced, to, give, up, his, position, in, the, government, he, stepped, down, on, 9, october, at, the, new, national, convention, on, 4, october, 1792, danton, proposed, to, declare, that, the, fatherland, was, no, longer, in, danger, asking, only, to, renounce, extreme, measures, he, measured, the, risks, posed, to, the, revolution, by, fratricidal, quarrels, between, republicans, he, preached, conciliation, and, calls, the, assembly, several, times, to, holy, harmony, it, was, in, vain, that, we, complained, to, danton, about, the, girondine, faction, wrote, robespierre, he, maintained, that, there, was, no, faction, there, and, that, everything, was, the, result, of, vanity, and, personal, animosities, but, the, attacks, from, the, girondins, concentrated, on, him, marat, and, robespierre, the, triumvirs, accused, of, aspiring, to, dictatorship, danton, defends, robespierre, at, the, end, of, october, by, declaring, that, all, those, who, talk, about, the, robespierre, faction, are, in, my, eyes, either, prejudiced, men, or, bad, citizens, but, dissociates, himself, from, marat, by, pronouncing, i, don, t, like, the, individual, marat, i, say, frankly, that, i, have, experiences, his, temperament, he, is, volcanic, cantankerous, and, unsociable, the, girondins, attacked, danton, for, his, management, of, the, secret, funds, of, the, ministry, of, justice, roland, minister, of, the, interior, scrupulously, gave, his, accounts, but, danton, would, not, harassed, by, brissot, he, only, escaped, through, weariness, of, the, convention, and, for, months, the, girondins, shouted, and, the, accounts, to, interrupt, him, at, the, podium, meanwhile, his, influence, began, to, decline, in, favor, of, robespierre, as, the, real, leader, of, the, mountain, on, 10, february, 1793, while, danton, was, on, a, mission, in, belgium, his, wife, died, while, giving, birth, to, their, fourth, child, who, also, died, robespierre, sent, danton, a, message, danton, was, so, affected, by, their, deaths, that, he, recruited, the, sculptor, claude, andr, deseine, and, a, week, after, charpentier, s, death, brought, him, to, sainte, catherine, cemetery, to, exhume, her, body, and, execute, a, plaster, bust, of, her, appearance, on, 10, march, danton, supported, the, foundation, of, a, revolutionary, tribunal, he, proposed, the, release, of, all, imprisoned, debtors, as, conscripts, in, the, army, on, 6, april, the, committee, of, public, safety, which, was, then, composed, of, only, nine, members, was, installed, on, the, proposal, of, maximin, isnard, who, was, supported, by, georges, danton, danton, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, committee, he, and, other, members, of, the, committee, despite, its, primary, charge, of, defeating, invasion, and, internal, rebellions, were, advocates, of, the, moderation, necessary, to, minimize, popular, resistance, to, military, requisitions, due, to, military, reversals, in, 1793, many, especially, among, the, sans, culottes, criticized, its, conduct, and, subsequent, committee, membership, included, more, radical, thinkers, who, pressed, for, more, extreme, measures, to, ensure, victory, over, enemies, of, the, revolution, internal, and, external, on, 20, march, 1793, the, national, convention, send, danton, and, delacroix, to, leuven, to, investigate, dumouriez, during, war, with, the, dutch, republic, and, his, generals, on, 27, april, the, convention, decreed, on, the, proposal, of, danton, to, send, additional, military, forces, to, the, departments, in, revolt, on, 1, june, hanriot, was, ordered, to, fire, a, cannon, on, the, pont, neuf, as, a, sign, of, alarm, when, the, convention, assembled,

on, 2, june, according, to, louis, madelin, and, mignet, a, large, force, of, armed, citizens, some, estimated, 80, 000, or, 100, 000, but, danton, spoke, of, only, 30, 000, surrounded, the, convention, with, 48, pieces, of, artillery, the, next, day, the, interior, minister, garat, forced, danton, to, disavow, the, events, from, the, evening, before, on, 1, july, 1793, danton, married, louise, s, bastienne, g, ly, aged, 17, daughter, of, marc, antoine, g, ly, court, usher, huissier, audiencier, at, the, parlement, of, paris, and, member, of, the, club, des, cordeliers, on, 10, july, he, was, not, re, elected, as, a, member, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, seventeen, days, later, maximilien, robespierre, joined, the, committee, of, public, safety, nearly, two, years, after, danton, had, extended, an, invitation, to, him, to, do, so, on, 5, september, danton, argued, for, a, law, to, give, the, sans, culottes, a, small, compensation, for, attending, the, twice, weekly, section, meetings, and, to, provide, a, gun, to, every, citizen, on, 6, september, danton, refused, to, take, a, seat, in, the, comit, de, salut, public, declaring, that, he, would, join, no, committee, but, would, be, a, spur, to, them, all, he, believed, a, stable, government, was, needed, which, could, resist, the, orders, of, the, comit, de, salut, public, on, 10, october, danton, who, had, been, dangerously, ill, for, a, few, weeks, quit, politics, and, set, off, to, arcis, sur, aube, with, his, 16, year, old, wife, who, had, pitied, queen, marie, antoinette, since, her, trial, began, on, 18, november, after, the, arrest, of, fran, ois, chabot, edme, bonaventure, courtois, urged, danton, to, come, back, to, paris, to, again, play, a, role, in, politics, on, 22, november, danton, attacked, religious, persecution, and, demanded, frugality, with, human, lives, he, tried, to, weaken, the, terror, by, attacking, jacques, ren, h, bert, on, 3, december, robespierre, accused, danton, in, the, jacobin, club, of, feigning, an, illness, with, the, intention, to, emigrate, to, switzerland, declaring, that, danton, showed, too, often, his, vices, and, not, his, virtue, robespierre, was, stopped, in, his, attack, the, gathering, was, closed, after, thunderous, applause, for, danton, danton, maintained, that, he, had, absolutely, no, intention, of, breaking, the, revolutionary, impulse, on, 9, december, danton, became, embroiled, in, a, scandal, concerning, the, bankruptcy, proceedings, of, the, french, east, india, company, when, it, was, discovered, that, directors, of, the, company, had, bribed, certain, government, officials, to, allow, the, company, to, liquidate, its, own, assets, rather, than, the, government, controlling, the, process, by, december, a, dantonist, party, had, been, formed, in, support, of, danton, s, more, moderate, views, and, his, insistence, on, clemency, for, those, who, had, violated, the, committee, for, public, safety, s, increasingly, arbitrary, and, draconian, counter, revolutionary, measures, on, 25, december, 5, niv, se, year, ii, robespierre, replied, to, danton, s, plea, for, an, end, to, the, terror, the, french, national, convention, during, the, autumn, of, 1793, began, to, assert, its, authority, further, throughout, france, creating, the, bloodiest, period, of, the, french, revolution, during, which, some, historians, assert, approximately, 40, 000, people, were, killed, in, france, following, the, fall, of, the, girondins, a, group, known, as, the, indulgents, would, emerge, from, amongst, the, montagnards, as, the, legislative, right, within, the, convention, with, danton, as, their, most, vocal, leader, having, long, supported, the, progressive, acts, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, danton, would, begin, to, propose, that, the, committee, retract, legislation, instituting, terror, as, the, order, of, the, day, on, 26, february, 1794, saint, just, delivered, a, speech, before, the, convention, in, which, he, directed, the, assault, against, danton, claiming, that, the, dantonists, wanted, to, slow, down, the, terror, and, the, revolution, it, seems, danton, became, exasperated, by, robespierre, s, repeated, references, to, virtue, on, 6, march, bar, re, attacked, the, h, bertists, and, dantonists, while, the, committee, of, public, safety, was, concerned, with, strengthening, the, centralist, policies, of, the, convention, and, its, own, grip, over, that, body, danton, was, in, the, process, of, devising, a, plan, that, would, effectively, move, popular, sentiment, among, delegates, towards, a, more, moderate, stance, this, meant, adopting, values, popular, among, the, sans, culotte, notably, the, control, of, bread, prices, that, had, seen, drastic, increase, with, the, famine, that, was, being, experienced, throughout, france, danton, also, proposed, that, the, convention, begin, taking, actions, towards, peace, with, foreign, powers, as, the, committee, had, declared, war, on, the, majority, of, european, powers, such, as, britain, spain, and, portugal, danton, made, a, triumphant, speech, announcing, the, end, of, the, terror, as, robespierre, listened, he, was, convinced, that, danton, was, pushing, for, leadership, in, a, post, terror, government, if, robespierre, did, not, counter, attack, quickly, the, dantonists, could, seize, control, of, the, national, convention, and, bring, an, end, to, his, republic, of, virtue, the, reign, of, terror, was, not, a, policy, that, could, be, easily, transformed, indeed, it, would, eventually, continue, past, the, thermidorian, reaction, 27, july, 1794, when, some, members, of, the, convention, rose, against, the, committee, executed, its, leaders, and, placed, power, in, the, hands, of, new, men, with, a, new, policy, to, dissolve, jacobinism, white, terror, however, in, germinal, that, is, in, march, 1794, the, anti, terror, sentiment, had, not, yet, reached, critical, mass, the, committees, were, still, too, strong, to, be, overthrown, and, danton, heedless, instead, of, striking, with, vigor, in, the, convention, waited, to, be, struck, in, these, latter, days, wrote, morley, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, a, certain, discouragement, seems, to, have, come, over, his, spirit, danton, remarried, and, morley, continues, the, rumour, went, that, he, was, allowing, domestic, happiness, to, tempt, him, from, the, keen, incessant, vigilance, proper, to, the, politician, in, such, a, crisis, ultimately, danton, himself, would, become, a, victim, of, the, terror, in, attempting, to, shift, the, direction, of, the, revolution, by, collaborating, with, camille, desmoulins, on, the, production, of, le, vieux, cordelier, a, newspaper, that, called, for, the, end, of, the, official, terror, and, dechristianization, as, well, as, for, launching, new, peace, overtures, to, france, s, enemies, danton, had, placed, himself, in, a, precarious, position, those, most, closely, associated, with, the, committee, of, public, safety, among, them, key, figures, such, as, maximilien, robespierre, and, georges, couthon, would, eventually, indict, danton, for, counter, revolutionary, activities, toward, the, end, of, the, reign, of, terror, danton, was, accused, of, various, financial, misdeeds, as, well, as, using, his, position, within, the, revolution, for, personal, gain, many, of, his, contemporaries, commented, on, danton, s, financial, success, during, the, revolution, certain, acquisitions, of, money, that, he, could, not, adequately, explain, many, of, the, specific, accusations, directed, against, him, were, based, on, insubstantial, or, ambiguous, evidence, for, the, revolutionary, tribunal, legal, evidence, was, unnecessary, moral, conviction, by, jury, was, enough, to, speed, up, the, proceedings, between, 1791, and, 1793, danton, faced, many, allegations, including, taking, bribes, during, the, insurrection, of, august, 1792, helping, his, secretaries, to, line, their, pockets, and, forging, assignats, during, his, mission, to, belgium, perhaps, the, most, compelling, evidence, of, financial, corruption, was, a, letter, from, mirabeau, to, danton, in, march, 1791, that, casually, referred, to, 30, 000, livres, that, danton, had, received, in, payment, during, his, tenure, on, the, committee, of, public, safety, danton, organized, a, peace, treaty, agreement, with, sweden, although, the, swedish, government, never, ratified, the, treaty, on, 28, june, 1793, the, convention, voted, to, pay, 4, million, livres, to, the, swedish, regent, for, diplomatic, negotiations, according, to, bertrand, bar, re, a, journalist, and, member, of, the, convention, danton, had, taken, a, portion, of, this, money, which, was, intended, for, the, swedish, regent, bar, re, s, accusation, was, never, supported, by, any, form, of, evidence, the, most, serious, accusation, which, haunted, him, during, his, arrest, and, formed, a, chief, ground, for, his, execution, was, his, alleged, involvement, with, a, scheme, to, appropriate, the, wealth, of, the, french, east, india, company, during, the, reign, of, the, old, regime, the, original, french, east, india, company, went, bankrupt, it, was, later, revived, in, 1785, backed, by, royal, patronage, the, company, eventually, fell, under, the, notice, of, the, national, convention, for, profiteering, during, the, war, the, company, was, soon, liquidated, while, certain, members, of, the, convention, tried, to, push, through, a,

repeated, references, to, virtue, as, the, foundation, of, the, revolutionary, government, danton, s, continual, criticism, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, provoked, further, counter, attacks, on, 26, february, 1794, saint, just, the, president, of, the, convention, delivered, a, speech, in, which, he, directed, the, assault, against, danton, at, the, end, of, march, 1794, danton, made, a,

months, robespierre, had, resisted, arresting, danton, according, to, linton, robespierre, had, to, choose, between, friendship, and, virtue, his, aim, was, to, sow, enough, doubt, in, the, minds, of, the, deputies, regarding, danton, s, political, integrity, to, make, it, possible, to, proceed, against, him, robespierre, refused, to, see, desmoulins, and, rejected, a, private, appeal, then, robespierre, broke, with, danton, who, had, angered, many, other, members, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, with, his, more, moderate, views, on, the, terror, but, whom, robespierre, had, until, this, point, persisted, in, defending, on, 30, march, the, two, committees, reached, a, decision, to, apprehend, danton, desmoulins, marie, jean, h, rault, de, s, chelles, and, pierre,

the, french, east, india, company, conveniently, paved, the, way, for, danton, s, downfall, danton, desmoulins, and, several, others, faced, trial, from, 3, 5, april, before, the, revolutionary, tribunal, presided, over, by, martial, herman, described, as, more, politically, charged, than, criminally, focused, the, trial, proceeded, in, an, irregular, manner, the, tribunal, constituted, a, jury, of, five, judges, including, souberbielle, and, fran, ois, topino, lebrun, who, both, hesitated, to, condemn, danton, the, law, required, twelve, jurors, but, only, seven, were, present, both, delacroix, and, danton, requested, the, right, to, present, about, 15, witnesses, in, their, defense, but, president, herman, denied, their, request, during, the, convention, louis, legendre, who, was, also, one, of, the, witnesses, proposed, hearing, from, danton, within, the, assembly, but, robespierre, replied, it, would, be, violating, the, laws, of, impartiality, to, grant, to, danton, what, was, refused, to, others, who, had, an, equal, right, to, make, the, same, demand, this, answer, silenced, at, once, all, solicitations, in, his, favor, no, friend, of, the, dantonists, dared,

the, committee, of, public, safety, causing, concern, among, the, jury, that, he, might, win, favor, with, the, crowd, following, robespierre, s, advice, a, decree, was, accepted, to, present, saint, just, s, account, on, danton, s, alleged, royalist, tendencies, at, the, tribunal, effectively, ending, further, debates, and, restraining, any, further, insults, to, justice, by, the, accused, the, convention, amidst, what, was, described, as, one, of, its, worst, fits, of, cowardice, approved, saint, just, s, proposal, during, the, trial, this, proposal, allowed, the, tribunal, to, exclude, any, prisoner, displaying, disrespect, for, justice, from, further, proceedings, enabling, the, tribunal, to, pronounce, a, sentence, in, the, absentia, of, the, accused, president, herman, struggled, to, control, the, proceedings, until, the, convention, enacted, the, aforementioned, decree, limiting, the, accused, from, further, self, defense, these, events, were, compounded, by, confusing, and, often, incidental, accusations, such, as, a, report, suggesting, that, while, engaged, as, a, commissioner, in, belgium, danton, had, allegedly, appropriated, a, carriage, filled, with, table, linen, worth, two, or, three, hundred, thousand, livres, from, the, archduchess, of, austria, the, moniteur, published, an, account, of, the, discussion, in, the, jacobin, club, danton, was, accused, of, wanting, to, arrest, francois, henriot, on, 31, may, 1793, and, to, become, regent, for, louis, xvii, on, the, last, day, fouquier, tinville, asked, the, tribunal, to, order, the, defendants, who, confused, the, hearing, and, insulted, national, justice, to, the, guillotine, i, leave, it, all, in, a, frightful, welter, danton, said, not, a, man, of, them, has, an, idea, of, government, robespierre, will, follow, me, he, is, dragged, down, by, me, ah, better, to, be, a, poor, fisherman, than, to, meddle, with, the, government, of, men, judge, souberbielle, asked, himself, which, of, the, two, robespierre, or, danton, is, the, more, useful, to, the, republic, fouquier, tinville, resorted, to, his, customary, approach, asking, the, jury, if, they, felt, adequately, enlightened, ultimately, leading, to, a, verdict, of, guilty, the, defendants, of, whom, nine, were, d, put, s, of, the, convention, were, removed, from, the, room, before, the, verdict, was, delivered, and, by, cutting, their, hair, prepared, for, the, guillotine, danton, was, beheaded, on, 5, april, 1794, at, sunset, together, with, group, of, fifteen, people, which, included, h, rault, de, s, chelles, westermann, and, philippeaux, among, others, h, rault, de, s, chelle, was, first, desmoulins, died, third, and, danton, last, it, is, said, his, last, words, spoken, to, his, executioner, sanson,

robespierre, was, sharply, critical, of, amar, s, report, which, presented, the, scandal, as, purely, a, matter, of, fraud, robespierre, insisted, that, it, was, a, foreign, plot, demanded, that, the, report, be, re, written, and, used, the, scandal, as, the, basis, for, rhetorical, attacks, on, william, pitt, the, younger, who, he, believed, was, involved, the, directors, of, the, french, east, india, company, were, never, interrogated, at, all, danton, and, his, associates, were, buried, in, the, errancis, cemetery, a, common, place, of, interment, for, those, executed, during, the, revolution, in, the, mid, 19th, century, their, skeletal, remains, were, transferred, to, the, catacombs, of, paris, martial, herman, resigned, as, president, on, 7, april, on, 9, thermidor, when, garnier, de, l, aube, witnessed, robespierre, s, inability, to, respond, he, shouted, the, blood, of, danton, chokes, him, robespierre, then, finally, regained, his, voice, to, reply, with, his, one, recorded, statement, of, the, morning, a, demand, to, know, why, he, was, now, being, blamed, for, the, other, man, s, death, is, it, danton, you, regret, cowards, why, didn, t, you, defend, him, danton, s, influence, and, character, during, the, french, revolution, were, and, still, are, widely, disputed, among, many, historians, with, the, varied, perspectives, on, him, ranging, from, corrupt, and, violent, to, generous, and, patriotic, danton, did, not, leave, very, much, in, the, way, of, written, works, personal, or, political, therefore, most, information, about, his, actions, and, personality, has, been, derived, from, secondhand, sources, one, view, of, danton, presented, by, historians, like, thiers, and, mignet, suggested, he, was, a, gigantic, revolutionary, with, extravagant, passions, a, high, level, of, intelligence, and, an, eagerness, for, violence, in, the, pursuit, of, his, goals, another, portrait, of, danton, emerges, from, the, work, of, lamartine, who, called, danton, a, man, devoid, of, honor, principles, and, morality, who, found, only, excitement, and, a, chance, for, distinction, during, the, french, revolution, he, was, a, mere, statesman, of, materialism, who, was, bought, anew, every, day, any, revolutionary, moments, were, staged, for, the, prospect, of, glory, and, more, wealth, a, differing, perspective, on, danton, is, presented, by, robinet, whose, assessment, is, more, positive, and, portrays, him, as, a, figure, worthy, of, admiration, according, to, robinet, danton, was, a, committed, loving, generous, citizen, son, father, and, husband, he, remained, loyal, to, his, friends, and, the, country, of, france, by, avoiding, personal, ambition, and, gave, himself, wholly, to, the, cause, of, keeping, the, government, consolidated, for, the, republic, he, always, had, a, love, for, his, country, and, the, laboring, masses, who, he, felt, deserved, dignity, consolation, and, happiness, morley, 1911, wrote, that, danton, stands, out, as, a, master, of, commanding, phrase, one, of, his, fierce, sayings, has, become, a, proverb, against, the, duke, of, brunswick, and, the, invaders, il, nous, faut, de, l, audace, et, encore, de, l, audace, et, toujours, de, l, audace, we, need, daring, and, yet, more, daring, and, always, daring, according, to, georges, lefebvre, he, was, nonchalant, and, lazy, he, is, seen, as, an, optimist, a, leader, full, of, energy, who, liked, the, pleasures, of, life, carefree, and, indulgent
