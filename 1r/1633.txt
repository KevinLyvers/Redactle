jean, bernard, l, on, foucault, uk, b, r, n, r, l, e, f, u, k, o, us, b, r, n, r, l, e, f, u, k, o, french, 18, september, 1819, 11, february, 1868, was, a, french, physicist, best, known, for, his, demonstration, of, the, foucault, pendulum, a, device, demonstrating, the, effect, of, earth, s, rotation, he, also, made, an, early, measurement, of, the, speed, of, light, discovered, eddy, currents, and, is, credited, with, naming, the, gyroscope, the, son, of, a, publisher, foucault, was, born, in, paris, on, 18, september, 1819, after, an, education, received, chiefly, at, home, he, studied, medicine, which, he, abandoned, in, favour, of, physics, due, to, a, blood, phobia, he, first, directed, his, attention, to, the, improvement, of, louis, daguerre, s, photographic, processes, for, three, years, he, was, experimental, assistant, to, alfred, donn, 1801, 1878, in, his, course, of, lectures, on, microscopic, anatomy, with, hippolyte, fizeau, he, carried, out, a, series, of, investigations, on, the, intensity, of, the, light, of, the, sun, as, compared, with, that, of, carbon, in, the, arc, lamp, and, of, lime, in, the, flame, of, the, oxyhydrogen, blowpipe, on, the, interference, of, infrared, radiation, and, of, light, rays, differing, greatly, in, lengths, of, path, and, on, the, chromatic, polarization, of, light, in, 1849, foucault, experimentally, demonstrated, that, absorption, and, emission, lines, appearing, at, the, same, wavelength, are, both, due, to, the, same, material, with, the, difference, between, the, two, originating, from, the, temperature, of, the, light, source, in, 1850, he, did, an, experiment, using, a, rotating, mirror, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, it, was, viewed, as, driving, the, last, nail, in, the, coffin, of, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, of, light, when, it, showed, that, light, travels, more, slowly, through, water, than, through, air, in, 1851, he, provided, an, experimental, demonstration, of, the, rotation, of, the, earth, on, its, axis, diurnal, motion, this, experimental, setup, had, been, used, by, vincenzo, viviani, but, became, well, known, to, the, public, by, foucault, s, work, foucault, achieved, the, demonstration, by, showing, the, rotation, of, the, plane, of, oscillation, of, a, long, and, heavy, pendulum, suspended, from, the, roof, of, the, panth, on, paris, the, experiment, caused, a, sensation, in, both, the, learned, and, popular, worlds, and, foucault, pendulums, were, suspended, in, major, cities, across, europe, and, america, and, attracted, crowds, in, the, following, year, he, used, and, named, the, gyroscope, as, a, conceptually, simpler, experimental, proof, see, foucault, s, gyroscope, experiment, in, 1855, he, received, the, copley, medal, of, the, royal, society, for, his, very, remarkable, experimental, researches, earlier, in, the, same, year, he, was, made, physicien, physicist, at, the, imperial, observatory, at, paris, in, september, 1855, he, discovered, that, the, force, required, for, the, rotation, of, a, copper, disc, becomes, greater, when, it, is, made, to, rotate, with, its, rim, between, the, poles, of, a, magnet, the, disc, at, the, same, time, becoming, heated, by, the, eddy, current, or, foucault, currents, induced, in, the, metal, in, 1857, foucault, invented, the, polarizer, which, bears, his, name, and, in, the, succeeding, year, devised, a, method, of, testing, the, mirror, of, a, reflecting, telescope, to, determine, its, shape, the, so, called, foucault, knife, edge, test, allows, the, worker, to, tell, if, the, mirror, is, perfectly, spherical, or, has, non, spherical, deviation, in, its, figure, prior, to, foucault, s, publication, of, his, findings, the, testing, of, reflecting, telescope, mirrors, was, a, hit, or, miss, proposition, foucault, s, knife, edge, test, determines, the, shape, of, a, mirror, by, finding, the, focal, lengths, of, its, areas, commonly, called, zones, and, measured, from, the, mirror, center, in, the, test, light, from, a, point, source, is, focused, onto, the, center, of, curvature, of, the, mirror, and, reflected, back, to, a, knife, edge, the, test, enables, the, tester, to, quantify, the, conic, section, of, the, mirror, thereby, allowing, the, tester, to, validate, the, actual, shape, of, the, mirror, which, is, necessary, to, obtain, optimal, performance, of, the, optical, system, the, foucault, test, is, in, use, to, this, date, most, notably, by, amateur, and, smaller, commercial, telescope, makers, as, it, is, inexpensive, and, uses, simple, easily, made, equipment, with, charles, wheatstone, s, revolving, mirror, he, in, 1862, determined, the, speed, of, light, to, be, 298, 000, km, s, 10, 000, km, s, less, than, that, obtained, by, previous, experimenters, and, only, 0, 6, in, error, of, the, currently, accepted, value, in, 1862, foucault, was, made, a, member, of, the, bureau, des, longitudes, and, an, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, he, became, a, member, of, the, royal, society, of, london, in, 1864, and, member, of, the, mechanical, section, of, the, institute, a, year, later, in, 1865, he, published, his, papers, on, a, modification, of, james, watt, s, centrifugal, governor, he, had, for, some, time, been, experimenting, with, a, view, to, making, its, period, of, revolution, constant, and, developing, a, new, apparatus, for, regulating, the, electric, light, foucault, showed, how, by, the, deposition, of, a, transparently, thin, film, of, silver, on, the, outer, side, of, the, object, glass, of, a, telescope, the, sun, could, be, viewed, without, injuring, the, eye, his, chief, scientific, papers, are, to, be, found, in, the, comptes, rendus, 1847, 1869, near, his, death, he, returned, to, roman, catholicism, that, he, previously, abandoned, foucault, died, of, what, was, probably, a, rapidly, developing, case, of, multiple, sclerosis, on, 11, february, 1868, in, paris, and, was, buried, in, the, montmartre, cemetery, the, asteroid, 5668, foucault, was, named, for, him, his, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, collected, works
