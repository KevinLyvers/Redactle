artemisia, lomi, or, artemisia, gentileschi, us, d, n, t, i, l, s, k, i, italian, 8, july, 1593, c, 1656, was, an, italian, baroque, painter, gentileschi, is, considered, among, the, most, accomplished, 17th, century, artists, initially, working, in, the, style, of, caravaggio, she, was, producing, professional, work, by, the, age, of, 15, in, an, era, when, women, had, few, opportunities, to, pursue, artistic, training, or, work, as, professional, artists, gentileschi, was, the, first, woman, to, become, a, member, of, the, accademia, di, arte, del, disegno, in, florence, and, she, had, an, international, clientele, many, of, gentileschi, s, paintings, feature, women, from, myths, allegories, and, the, bible, including, victims, suicides, and, warriors, some, of, her, best, known, subjects, are, susanna, and, the, elders, particularly, the, 1610, version, in, pommersfelden, judith, slaying, holofernes, her, 1614, 1620, version, is, in, the, uffizi, gallery, and, judith, and, her, maidservant, her, 1625, work, is, in, the, detroit, institute, of, arts, gentileschi, was, known, for, being, able, to, depict, the, female, figure, with, great, naturalism, and, for, her, skill, in, handling, colour, to, express, dimension, and, drama, her, achievements, as, an, artist, were, long, overshadowed, by, the, story, of, agostino, tassi, raping, her, when, she, was, a, young, woman, and, gentileschi, being, tortured, to, give, evidence, during, his, trial, for, many, years, gentileschi, was, regarded, as, a, curiosity, but, her, life, and, art, have, been, reexamined, by, scholars, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, with, the, recognition, of, her, talents, exemplified, by, major, exhibitions, at, internationally, esteemed, fine, art, institutions, such, as, the, national, gallery, in, london, artemisia, lomi, gentileschi, was, born, in, rome, on, 8, july, 1593, although, her, birth, certificate, from, the, archivio, di, stato, indicates, she, was, born, in, 1590, she, was, the, eldest, child, of, prudenzia, di, ottaviano, montoni, and, the, tuscan, painter, orazio, gentileschi, orazio, gentileschi, was, a, painter, from, pisa, after, his, arrival, in, rome, his, painting, reached, its, expressive, peak, taking, inspiration, from, the, innovations, of, caravaggio, from, whom, he, derived, the, habit, of, painting, real, models, without, idealising, or, sweetening, them, instead, transfiguring, them, into, figures, of, powerful, and, realistic, drama, baptised, two, days, after, her, birth, in, the, church, of, san, lorenzo, in, lucina, artemisia, was, primarily, raised, by, her, father, following, the, death, of, her, mother, in, 1605, it, was, likely, at, this, time, that, artemisia, approached, painting, introduced, to, painting, in, her, father, s, workshop, artemisia, showed, much, more, enthusiasm, and, talent, than, her, brothers, who, worked, alongside, her, she, learned, drawing, how, to, mix, colour, and, how, to, paint, by, 1612, aged, 18, artemisia, was, known, for, her, exemplary, talents, with, her, father, boasting, that, despite, having, only, practised, painting, for, three, years, artemisia, was, peerless, during, this, early, period, of, her, life, artemisia, took, inspiration, from, her, father, s, painting, style, which, had, in, turn, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, work, of, caravaggio, artemisia, s, approach, to, subject, matter, was, different, from, that, of, her, father, however, taking, a, highly, naturalistic, approach, over, her, father, s, comparatively, idealised, works, her, earliest, surviving, work, completed, aged, 17, is, susanna, and, the, elders, 1610, sch, nborn, collection, in, pommersfelden, the, painting, depicts, the, biblical, story, of, susanna, the, painting, shows, how, artemisia, assimilated, the, realism, of, and, effects, used, by, caravaggio, without, being, indifferent, to, the, classicism, of, annibale, carracci, and, the, bolognese, school, of, baroque, style, in, 1611, orazio, was, working, with, agostino, tassi, to, decorate, the, vaults, of, casino, delle, muse, inside, the, palazzo, pallavicini, rospigliosi, in, rome, one, day, in, may, tassi, visited, the, gentileschi, household, and, when, alone, with, artemisia, raped, her, another, man, cosimo, quorli, played, a, part, in, the, rape, a, female, friend, of, gentileschi, tuzia, was, present, during, the, rape, but, refused, to, help, her, with, the, expectation, that, they, would, marry, in, order, to, restore, her, virtue, and, secure, her, future, artemisia, started, to, have, sexual, relations, with, tassi, but, he, reneged, on, his, promise, to, marry, her, nine, months, after, the, rape, when, he, learned, that, artemisia, and, tassi, were, not, going, to, be, married, her, father, orazio, pressed, charges, against, tassi, the, major, issue, of, the, trial, was, the, fact, that, tassi, had, violated, the, gentileschi, family, s, honor, and, charges, were, not, pressed, for, violating, artemisia, during, the, ensuing, seven, month, trial, it, was, discovered, that, tassi, had, planned, to, murder, his, wife, had, engaged, in, adultery, with, his, sister, in, law, and, planned, to, steal, some, of, orazio, s, paintings, at, the, end, of, the, trial, tassi, was, exiled, from, rome, although, the, sentence, was, never, carried, out, during, the, trial, artemisia, was, tortured, with, thumbscrews, for, the, purpose, of, verifying, her, testimony, after, her, mother, died, artemisia, had, been, surrounded, mainly, by, males, when, she, was, 17, orazio, rented, the, upstairs, apartment, of, their, home, to, a, female, tenant, tuzia, artemisia, befriended, tuzia, however, tuzia, allowed, agostino, tassi, and, cosimo, quorli, to, visit, artemisia, in, artemisia, s, home, on, multiple, occasions, the, day, the, rape, occurred, artemisia, cried, out, to, tuzia, for, help, but, tuzia, simply, ignored, artemisia, and, pretended, she, knew, nothing, of, what, happened, art, historian, jeanne, morgan, zarucchi, compared, tuzia, s, betrayal, and, role, in, facilitating, the, rape, to, the, role, of, a, procuress, who, is, complicit, in, the, sexual, exploitation, of, a, prostitute, a, painting, entitled, mother, and, child, discovered, in, crow, s, nest, australia, in, 1976, may, or, may, not, have, been, painted, by, gentileschi, on, the, presumption, that, it, is, her, work, the, baby, has, been, interpreted, as, an, indirect, reference, to, agostino, tassi, her, rapist, as, it, dates, to, 1614, just, two, years, after, the, rape, it, depicts, a, strong, and, suffering, woman, and, casts, light, on, her, anguish, and, expressive, artistic, capability, a, month, after, the, trial, orazio, arranged, for, his, daughter, to, marry, pierantonio, stiattesi, a, modest, artist, from, florence, shortly, afterward, the, couple, moved, to, florence, the, six, years, she, spent, in, florence, would, be, decisive, both, for, artemisia, s, family, life, and, professional, career, artemisia, became, a, successful, court, painter, enjoying, the, patronage, of, the, house, of, medici, and, playing, a, significant, role, in, courtly, culture, of, the, city, artemisia, s, career, as, an, artist, was, very, successful, in, florence, she, was, the, first, woman, accepted, into, the, accademia, delle, arti, del, disegno, academy, of, the, arts, of, drawing, she, maintained, good, relations, with, the, most, respected, artists, of, her, time, such, as, cristofano, allori, and, was, able, to, garner, the, favour, and, the, protection, of, influential, people, beginning, with, cosimo, ii, de, medici, grand, duke, of, tuscany, and, especially, of, the, grand, duchess, christina, of, lorraine, her, acquaintance, with, galileo, galilei, evident, from, a, letter, she, wrote, to, the, scientist, in, 1635, appears, to, stem, from, her, florentine, years, indeed, it, may, have, stimulated, her, depiction, of, the, compass, in, the, allegory, of, inclination, her, involvement, in, the, courtly, culture, of, florence, not, only, provided, access, to, patrons, but, it, widened, her, education, and, exposure, to, the, arts, she, learned, to, read, and, write, and, became, familiar, with, musical, and, theatrical, performances, such, artistic, spectacles, helped, artemisia, s, approach, to, depicting, lavish, clothing, in, her, paintings, artemisia, understood, that, the, representation, of, biblical, or, mythological, figures, in, contemporary, dress, was, an, essential, feature, of, the, spectacle, of, courtly, life, in, 1615, she, received, the, attention, of, michelangelo, buonarroti, the, younger, a, great, nephew, of, michelangelo, busy, with, the, construction, of, the, casa, buonarroti, to, celebrate, his, noted, relative, he, asked, artemisia, along, with, other, florentine, artists, including, agostino, ciampelli, sigismondo, coccapani, giovan, battista, guidoni, and, zanobi, rosi, to, contribute, a, painting, for, the, ceiling, artemisia, was, then, in, an, advanced, state, of, pregnancy, each, artist, was, commissioned, to, present, an, allegory, of, a, virtue, associated, with, michelangelo, and, artemisia, was, assigned, the, allegory, of, inclination, in, this, instance, artemisia, was, paid, three, times, more, than, any, other, artist, participating, in, the, series, artemisia, painted, her, commission, in, the, form, of, a, nude, young, woman, holding, a, compass, her, painting, is, located, on, the, galleria, ceiling, on, the, second, floor, it, is, believed, that, the, subject, bears, a, resemblance, to, artemisia, indeed, in, several, of, her, paintings, artemisia, s, energetic, heroines, appear, to, be, self, portraits, other, significant, works, from, this, period, include, la, conversione, della, maddalena, the, conversion, of, the, magdalene, self, portrait, as, a, lute, player, in, the, collection, of, the, wadsworth, atheneum, museum, of, art, and, giuditta, con, la, sua, ancella, judith, and, her, maidservant, now, in, the, palazzo, pitti, artemisia, painted, a, second, version, of, judith, beheading, holofernes, which, now, is, housed, in, the, uffizi, gallery, of, florence, her, first, judith, beheading, holofernes, 1612, 13, smaller, in, size, is, displayed, in, the, museo, di, capodimonte, naples, in, fact, she, was, fascinated, with, this, subject, and, six, variations, of, judith, beheading, holofernes, by, artemisia, are, known, to, exist, while, in, florence, artemisia, and, pierantonio, had, five, children, giovanni, battista, agnola, and, lisabella, did, not, survive, for, more, than, a, year, their, second, son, cristofano, died, at, the, age, of, five, after, artemisia, had, returned, to, rome, only, prudentia, survived, into, adulthood, prudentia, was, also, known, as, palmira, which, has, led, some, scholars, to, conclude, erroneously, that, artemisia, had, a, sixth, child, prudentia, was, named, after, artemisia, s, mother, it, is, known, that, artemisia, s, daughter, was, a, painter, and, was, trained, by, her, mother, although, nothing, is, known, of, her, work, in, 2011, francesco, solinas, discovered, a, collection, of, 36, letters, dating, from, about, 1616, to, 1620, that, add, startling, context, to, the, personal, and, financial, life, of, the, gentileschi, family, in, florence, they, show, that, artemisia, had, a, passionate, love, affair, with, a, wealthy, florentine, nobleman, francesco, maria, maringhi, her, husband, pierantonio, stiattesi, was, well, aware, of, their, relationship, and, he, maintained, a, correspondence, with, maringhi, on, the, back, of, artemisia, s, love, letters, he, tolerated, it, presumably, because, maringhi, was, a, powerful, ally, who, provided, the, couple, with, financial, support, however, by, 1620, rumours, of, the, affair, had, begun, to, spread, in, the, florentine, court, and, this, combined, with, ongoing, legal, and, financial, problems, led, the, couple, to, relocate, to, rome, just, as, with, the, preceding, decade, the, early, 1620s, saw, ongoing, upheaval, in, artemisia, gentileschi, s, life, her, son, cristofano, died, just, as, she, arrived, in, rome, her, father, orazio, departed, for, genoa, immediate, contact, with, her, lover, maringhi, appeared, to, have, lessened, by, 1623, any, mention, of, her, husband, disappears, from, any, surviving, documentation, her, arrival, in, rome, offered, the, opportunity, to, cooperate, with, other, painters, and, to, seek, patronage, from, the, wide, network, of, art, collectors, in, the, city, opportunities, that, gentileschi, grasped, one, art, historian, noted, of, the, period, artemisia, s, roman, career, quickly, took, off, the, money, problems, eased, large, scale, papal, commissions, were, largely, off, limits, however, the, long, papacy, of, urban, viii, showed, a, preference, for, large, scale, decorative, works, and, altarpieces, typified, by, the, baroque, style, of, pietro, da, cortona, gentileschi, s, training, in, easel, paintings, and, perhaps, the, suspicion, that, women, painters, did, not, have, the, energy, to, carry, out, large, scale, painting, cycles, meant, that, the, ambitious, patrons, within, urban, s, circle, commissioned, other, artists, but, rome, hosted, a, wide, range, of, patrons, fernando, afan, de, ribera, 3rd, duke, of, alcala, a, spanish, nobleman, acquired, her, penitent, magdalene, christ, blessing, the, children, and, david, with, a, harp, during, the, same, period, she, became, associated, with, cassiano, dal, pozzo, a, humanist, and, a, collector, and, lover, of, arts, dal, pozzo, helped, to, forge, relationships, with, other, artists, and, patrons, her, reputation, grew, the, visiting, french, artist, pierre, dumonstier, ii, produced, a, black, and, red, chalk, drawing, of, her, right, hand, in, 1625, the, variety, of, patrons, in, rome, also, meant, a, variety, of, styles, caravaggio, s, style, remained, highly, influential, and, converted, many, painters, to, following, his, style, the, so, called, caravaggisti, such, as, carlo, saraceni, who, returned, to, venice, in, 1620, bartolomeo, manfredi, and, simon, vouet, gentileschi, and, vouet, would, go, on, to, have, a, professional, relationship, and, would, influence, each, other, s, styles, vouet, would, go, on, to, complete, a, portrait, of, artemisia, gentileschi, also, interacted, with, the, bentveughels, group, of, flemish, and, dutch, painters, living, in, rome, the, bolognese, school, particularly, during, the, 1621, to, 1623, period, of, gregory, xv, also, began, to, grow, in, popularity, and, her, susanna, and, the, elders, 1622, often, is, associated, with, the, style, introduced, by, guercino, although, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, date, her, paintings, it, is, possible, to, assign, certain, works, by, gentileschi, to, these, years, such, as, portrait, of, a, gonfaloniere, today, in, bologna, a, rare, example, of, her, capacity, as, portrait, painter, and, judith, and, her, maidservant, today, in, the, detroit, institute, of, arts, the, detroit, painting, is, notable, for, her, mastery, of, chiaroscuro, and, tenebrism, the, effects, of, extreme, lights, and, darks, techniques, for, which, gerrit, van, honthorst, and, many, others, in, rome, were, famous, the, absence, of, sufficient, documentation, makes, it, difficult, to, follow, gentileschi, s, movements, in, the, late, 1620s, however, it, is, certain, that, between, 1626, and, 1627, she, moved, to, venice, perhaps, in, search, of, richer, commissions, many, verses, and, letters, were, composed, in, appreciation, of, her, and, her, works, in, venice, knowledge, of, her, commissions, during, the, time, is, vague, but, her, the, sleeping, venus, today, in, the, virginia, museum, of, fine, arts, richmond, and, her, esther, before, ahasuerus, now, in, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, are, testaments, to, her, assimilation, of, the, lessons, of, venetian, colourism, in, 1630, artemisia, moved, to, naples, a, city, rich, with, workshops, and, art, lovers, in, search, of, new, and, more, lucrative, job, opportunities, the, eighteenth, century, biographer, bernardo, de, dominici, speculated, that, artemisia, was, already, known, in, naples, before, her, arrival, she, may, have, been, invited, to, naples, by, the, duke, of, alcal, who, had, bought, three, of, her, paintings, in, rome, many, other, artists, including, caravaggio, annibale, carracci, and, simon, vouet, had, stayed, in, naples, at, some, time, in, their, lives, at, that, time, jusepe, de, ribera, massimo, stanzione, and, domenichino, were, working, there, and, later, giovanni, lanfranco, and, many, other, artists, went, to, the, city, the, neapolitan, debut, of, artemisia, is, represented, by, the, annunciation, in, the, capodimonte, museum, painted, shortly, after, her, arrival, in, naples, the, sleeping, christ, child, is, one, of, only, three, copper, works, by, artemesia, known, to, exist, although, she, made, small, works, on, copper, throughout, her, career, with, the, exceptions, of, a, brief, trip, to, london, and, some, other, journeys, artemisia, resided, in, naples, for, the, remainder, of, her, career, on, saturday, march, 18, 1634, the, traveller, bullen, reymes, recorded, in, his, diary, visiting, artemisia, and, her, daughter, palmira, who, also, paints, with, a, group, of, fellow, englishmen, she, had, relations, with, many, renowned, artists, among, them, stanzione, with, whom, bernardo, de, dominici, reports, she, started, an, artistic, collaboration, based, on, a, real, friendship, and, artistic, similarities, artemisia, s, work, influenced, stanzione, s, use, of, colours, as, seen, in, his, assumption, of, the, virgin, c, 1630, de, dominici, states, that, stanzione, learned, how, to, compose, an, istoria, from, domenichino, but, learned, his, coloring, from, artemisia, in, naples, artemisia, started, working, on, paintings, in, a, cathedral, for, the, first, time, they, are, dedicated, to, san, gennaro, nell, anfiteatro, di, pozzuoli, saint, januarius, in, the, amphitheater, of, pozzuoli, in, pozzuoli, during, her, first, neapolitan, period, she, painted, the, birth, of, saint, john, the, baptist, now, in, the, prado, in, madrid, and, corisca, e, il, satiro, corisca, and, the, satyr, today, in, a, private, collection, in, these, paintings, artemisia, again, demonstrates, her, ability, to, adapt, to, the, novelties, of, the, period, and, to, handle, different, subjects, instead, of, the, usual, judith, susanna, bathsheba, and, penitent, magdalenes, for, which, she, already, was, known, many, of, these, paintings, were, collaborations, bathsheba, for, instance, was, attributed, to, artemisia, codazzi, and, gargiulo, in, 1638, artemisia, joined, her, father, in, london, at, the, court, of, charles, i, of, england, where, orazio, had, become, court, painter, and, received, the, important, job, of, decorating, a, ceiling, allegory, of, triumph, of, peace, and, the, arts, in, the, queen, s, house, greenwich, built, for, queen, henrietta, maria, father, and, daughter, were, working, together, once, again, although, helping, her, father, probably, was, not, her, only, reason, for, travelling, to, london, charles, i, had, invited, her, to, his, court, charles, i, was, an, enthusiastic, collector, willing, to, incur, criticism, for, his, spending, on, art, the, fame, of, artemisia, probably, intrigued, him, and, it, is, not, a, coincidence, that, his, collection, included, a, painting, of, great, suggestion, the, self, portrait, as, the, allegory, of, painting, which, is, the, lead, image, of, this, article, orazio, died, suddenly, in, 1639, artemisia, had, her, own, commissions, to, fulfil, after, her, father, s, death, although, there, are, no, known, works, assignable, with, certainty, to, this, period, it, is, known, that, artemisia, had, left, england, by, 1642, when, the, english, civil, war, was, just, starting, nothing, much, is, known, about, her, subsequent, movements, historians, know, that, in, 1649, she, was, in, naples, again, corresponding, with, don, antonio, ruffo, of, sicily, who, became, her, mentor, during, this, second, neapolitan, period, the, last, known, letter, to, her, mentor, is, dated, 1650, and, makes, clear, that, she, still, was, fully, active, in, her, last, known, years, of, activity, she, is, attributed, with, works, that, are, probably, commissions, and, follow, a, traditional, representation, of, the, feminine, in, her, works, it, was, once, believed, that, artemisia, died, in, 1652, or, 1653, however, modern, evidence, has, shown, that, she, was, still, accepting, commissions, in, 1654, although, she, was, increasingly, dependent, upon, her, assistant, onofrio, palumbo, some, have, speculated, that, she, died, in, the, devastating, plague, that, swept, naples, in, 1656, and, virtually, wiped, out, an, entire, generation, of, neapolitan, artists, some, works, in, this, period, are, the, susanna, and, the, elders, 1622, today, in, brno, the, virgin, and, child, with, a, rosary, today, in, el, escorial, the, david, and, bathsheba, today, in, columbus, ohio, and, the, bathsheba, today, in, leipzig, her, david, with, the, head, of, goliath, rediscovered, in, london, in, 2020, has, been, attributed, by, art, historian, gianni, papi, to, artemisia, s, london, period, another, work, susanna, and, the, elders, previously, owned, by, charles, i, was, rediscovered, in, the, royal, collection, in, london, in, 2023, the, research, paper, gentileschi, padre, e, figlia, 1916, by, roberto, longhi, an, italian, critic, described, artemisia, as, the, only, woman, in, italy, who, ever, knew, about, painting, coloring, drawing, and, other, fundamentals, longhi, also, wrote, of, judith, slaying, holofernes, there, are, about, fifty, seven, works, by, artemisia, gentileschi, and, 94, forty, nine, works, feature, women, as, protagonists, or, equal, to, men, these, include, her, works, of, jael, and, sisera, judith, and, her, maidservant, and, esther, these, characters, intentionally, lacked, the, stereotypical, feminine, traits, sensitivity, timidness, and, weakness, and, were, courageous, rebellious, and, powerful, personalities, such, subjects, are, now, grouped, under, the, name, the, power, of, women, a, nineteenth, century, critic, commented, on, artemisia, s, magdalene, stating, no, one, would, have, imagined, that, it, was, the, work, of, a, woman, the, brush, work, was, bold, and, certain, and, there, was, no, sign, of, timidness, in, raymond, ward, bissell, s, view, she, was, well, aware, of, how, women, and, female, artists, were, viewed, by, men, explaining, why, her, works, were, so, bold, and, defiant, in, the, beginning, of, her, career, longhi, wrote, who, could, think, in, fact, that, over, a, sheet, so, candid, a, so, brutal, and, terrible, massacre, could, happen, but, it, s, natural, to, say, this, is, a, terrible, woman, a, woman, painted, all, this, there, s, nothing, sadistic, here, instead, what, strikes, the, most, is, the, impassibility, of, the, painter, who, was, even, able, to, notice, how, the, blood, spurting, with, violence, can, decorate, with, two, drops, the, central, spurt, incredible, i, tell, you, and, also, please, give, mrs, schiattesi, the, conjugal, name, of, artemisia, the, chance, to, choose, the, hilt, of, the, sword, at, last, don, t, you, think, that, the, only, aim, of, giuditta, is, to, move, away, to, avoid, the, blood, which, could, stain, her, dress, we, think, anyway, that, that, is, a, dress, of, casa, gentileschi, the, finest, wardrobe, in, europe, during, 1600, after, van, dyck, feminist, studies, increased, the, interest, in, artemisia, gentileschi, underlining, her, rape, and, subsequent, mistreatment, and, the, expressive, strength, of, her, paintings, of, biblical, heroines, in, which, the, women, are, interpreted, as, willing, to, manifest, their, rebellion, against, their, condition, in, a, research, paper, from, the, catalogue, of, the, exhibition, orazio, e, artemisia, gentileschi, which, took, place, in, rome, in, 2001, and, after, in, new, york, judith, w, mann, critiques, feminist, opinion, of, artemisia, finding, that, old, stereotypes, of, artemisia, as, sexually, immoral, have, been, replaced, by, new, stereotypes, established, in, feminist, readings, of, artemisia, s, paintings, without, denying, that, sex, and, gender, can, offer, valid, interpretive, strategies, for, the, investigation, of, artemisia, s, art, we, may, wonder, whether, the, application, of, gendered, readings, has, created, too, narrow, an, expectation, underpinning, garrard, s, monograph, and, reiterated, in, a, limited, way, by, bissell, in, his, catalogue, raisonn, are, certain, presumptions, that, artemisia, s, full, creative, power, emerged, only, in, the, depiction, of, strong, assertive, women, that, she, would, not, engage, in, conventional, religious, imagery, such, as, the, madonna, and, child, or, a, virgin, who, responds, with, submission, to, the, annunciation, and, that, she, refused, to, yield, her, personal, interpretation, to, suit, the, tastes, of, her, presumably, male, clientele, this, stereotype, has, had, the, doubly, restricting, effect, of, causing, scholars, to, question, the, attribution, of, pictures, that, do, not, conform, to, the, model, and, to, value, less, highly, those, that, do, not, fit, the, mold, because, artemisia, returned, again, and, again, to, violent, subject, matter, such, as, judith, and, holofernes, a, repressed, vengeance, theory, has, been, postulated, by, some, art, historians, but, other, art, historians, suggest, that, she, was, shrewdly, taking, advantage, of, her, fame, from, the, rape, trial, to, cater, to, a, niche, market, in, sexually, charged, female, dominated, art, for, male, patrons, the, most, recent, critics, starting, from, the, difficult, reconstruction, of, the, entire, catalogue, of, the, gentileschi, have, tried, to, give, a, less, reductive, reading, of, the, career, of, artemisia, placing, it, in, the, context, of, the, different, artistic, environments, in, which, the, painter, participated, a, reading, such, as, this, restores, artemisia, as, an, artist, who, fought, with, determination, using, the, weapon, of, personality, and, of, the, artistic, qualities, against, the, prejudices, expressed, against, women, painters, being, able, to, introduce, herself, productively, in, the, circle, of, the, most, respected, painters, of, her, time, embracing, a, series, of, pictorial, genres, that, probably, were, more, ample, and, varied, than, her, paintings, suggest, feminist, interest, in, artemisia, gentileschi, dates, from, the, 1970s, when, the, feminist, art, historian, linda, nochlin, published, an, article, entitled, why, have, there, been, no, great, women, artists, in, which, that, question, was, dissected, and, analysed, the, article, explores, the, definition, of, great, artists, and, posited, that, oppressive, institutions, not, lack, of, talent, have, prevented, women, from, achieving, the, same, level, of, recognition, that, men, received, in, art, and, other, fields, nochlin, said, that, studies, on, artemisia, and, other, women, artists, were, worth, the, effort, in, adding, to, our, knowledge, of, women, s, achievement, and, of, art, history, generally, according, to, the, foreword, by, douglas, druick, in, eve, straussman, pflanzer, s, violence, virtue, artemisia, s, judith, slaying, holofernes, nochlin, s, article, prompted, scholars, to, make, more, of, an, attempt, to, integrate, women, artists, into, the, history, of, art, and, culture, artemisia, and, her, oeuvre, became, a, focus, again, having, had, little, attention, in, art, history, scholarship, save, roberto, longhi, s, article, gentileschi, padre, e, figlia, gentileschi, father, and, daughter, in, 1916, and, bissell, s, article, artemisia, gentileschi, a, new, documented, chronology, in, 1968, as, artemisia, and, her, work, began, to, garner, new, attention, among, art, historians, and, feminists, more, literature, about, her, fictional, and, biographical, was, published, a, fictional, account, of, her, life, by, anna, banti, wife, of, critic, roberto, longhi, was, published, in, 1947, this, account, was, well, received, by, literary, critics, but, was, criticized, by, feminists, notably, laura, benedetti, for, being, lenient, in, historical, accuracy, in, order, to, draw, parallels, between, author, and, artist, the, first, full, factual, account, of, artemisia, s, life, the, image, of, the, female, hero, in, italian, baroque, art, was, published, in, 1989, by, mary, garrard, a, feminist, art, historian, she, then, published, a, second, smaller, book, entitled, artemisia, gentileschi, around, 1622, the, shaping, and, reshaping, of, an, artistic, identity, in, 2001, that, explored, the, artist, s, work, and, identity, garrard, noted, that, analysis, of, artemisia, s, oeuvre, lacks, focus, and, stable, categorization, outside, of, woman, although, garrard, questions, whether, femaleness, is, a, legitimate, category, by, which, to, judge, her, art, at, all, artemisia, is, known, for, her, portrayals, of, subjects, from, the, power, of, women, group, for, example, her, versions, of, judith, slaying, holofernes, she, is, also, known, for, the, rape, trial, in, which, she, was, involved, which, scholar, griselda, pollock, has, argued, had, unfortunately, become, the, repeated, axis, of, interpretation, of, the, artist, s, work, gentileschi, s, status, in, popular, culture, is, deemed, by, pollock, to, be, due, less, to, her, work, than, to, the, sensationalism, caused, by, the, persistent, focus, on, the, rape, trial, during, which, she, was, tortured, pollock, offers, a, counter, reading, of, the, artist, s, dramatic, narrative, paintings, refusing, to, see, the, judith, and, holofernes, images, as, responses, to, rape, and, the, trial, instead, pollock, points, out, that, the, subject, of, judith, and, holofernes, is, not, a, revenge, theme, but, a, story, of, political, courage, and, indeed, collaboration, by, two, women, committing, a, daring, political, murder, in, a, war, situation, pollock, seeks, to, shift, attention, from, sensationalism, toward, deeper, analysis, of, gentileschi, s, paintings, notably, of, death, and, loss, suggesting, the, significance, of, her, childhood, bereavement, as, a, source, of, her, singular, images, of, the, dying, cleopatra, pollock, also, argues, that, gentileschi, s, success, in, the, seventeenth, century, depended, on, her, producing, paintings, for, patrons, often, portraying, subjects, they, selected, that, reflected, contemporary, tastes, and, fashions, she, aims, to, place, gentileschi, s, career, in, its, historical, context, of, taste, for, dramatic, narratives, of, heroines, from, the, bible, or, classical, sources, in, another, vein, entirely, american, professor, camille, paglia, has, argued, that, modern, feminist, preoccupation, with, artemisia, is, misguided, and, that, her, accomplishments, have, been, overstated, artemisia, gentileschi, was, simply, a, polished, competent, painter, in, a, baroque, style, created, by, men, nonetheless, according, to, the, national, gallery, artemisia, worked, in, rome, florence, venice, naples, and, london, for, the, highest, echelons, of, european, society, including, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, and, philip, iv, of, spain, feminist, literature, tends, to, revolve, around, the, event, of, artemisia, s, rape, largely, portraying, her, as, a, traumatised, but, noble, survivor, whose, work, became, characterised, by, sex, and, violence, as, a, result, of, her, experience, pollock, 2006, interpreted, the, film, by, agn, s, merlet, as, a, typical, example, of, the, inability, of, popular, culture, to, look, at, the, painter, s, remarkable, career, over, many, decades, and, in, many, major, centres, of, art, rather, than, this, one, episode, a, literature, review, by, laura, benedetti, reconstructing, artemisia, twentieth, century, images, of, a, woman, artist, concluded, that, artemisia, s, work, is, often, interpreted, according, to, the, contemporary, issues, and, personal, biases, of, the, authors, feminist, scholars, for, example, have, elevated, artemisia, to, the, status, of, feminist, icon, which, benedetti, attributed, to, artemisia, s, paintings, of, formidable, women, and, her, success, as, an, artist, in, a, male, dominated, field, while, also, being, a, single, mother, elena, ciletti, author, of, gran, macchina, a, bellezza, wrote, that, the, stakes, are, very, high, in, artemisia, s, case, especially, for, feminists, because, we, have, invested, in, her, so, much, of, our, quest, for, justice, for, women, historically, and, currently, intellectually, and, politically, feminist, scholars, suggest, that, artemisia, wanted, to, take, a, stand, against, the, stereotype, of, female, submissiveness, one, example, of, this, symbolism, appears, in, her, corisca, and, the, satyr, created, between, 1630, and, 1635, in, the, painting, a, nymph, runs, away, from, a, satyr, the, satyr, attempts, to, grab, the, nymph, by, her, hair, but, the, hair, is, a, wig, here, artemisia, depicts, the, nymph, to, be, quite, clever, and, to, be, actively, resisting, the, aggressive, attack, of, the, satyr, for, a, woman, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventeenth, century, artemisia, being, a, painter, represented, an, uncommon, and, difficult, choice, but, not, an, exceptional, one, artemisia, was, aware, of, her, position, as, a, female, artist, and, the, current, representations, of, women, s, relationship, to, art, this, is, evident, in, her, allegorical, self, portrait, self, portrait, as, la, pittura, which, shows, artemisia, as, a, muse, symbolic, embodiment, of, the, art, and, as, a, professional, artist, before, artemisia, between, the, end, of, the, 1500s, and, the, beginning, of, 1600s, other, women,
