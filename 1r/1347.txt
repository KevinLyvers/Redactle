pinochet, government, after, the, 1973, coup, there, was, no, evidence, that, the, us, was, directly, involved, in, it, this, view, has, been, contradicted, by, several, academics, such, as, peter, winn, who, writes, that, the, role, of, the, cia, was, crucial, to, the, consolidation, of, power, after, the, coup, the, cia, helped, fabricate, a, conspiracy, against, the, allende, government, which, pinochet, was, then, portrayed, as, preventing, he, stated, that, the, coup, itself, was, possible, only, through, a, three, year, covert, operation, mounted, by, the, united, states, winn, also, points, out, that, the, us, imposed, an, invisible, blockade, that, was, designed, to, disrupt, the, economy, under, allende, and, contributed, to, the, destabilization, of, the, regime, author, peter, kornbluh, argues, in, the, pinochet, file, that, the, us, was, extensively, involved, and, actively, fomented, the, 1973, coup, authors, tim, weiner, legacy, of, ashes, and, christopher, hitchens, the, trial, of, henry, kissinger, similarly, argue, the, case, that, us, covert, actions, actively, destabilized, allende, s, government, and, set, the, stage, for, the, 1973, coup, despite,

to, the, highest, levels, of, government, the, us, provided, material, support, to, the, military, government, after, the, coup, although, criticizing, it, in, public, a, document, released, by, the,

it, was, also, revealed, that, townley, who, was, expelled, from, chile, to, the, united, states, in, april, 1978, believed, that, contreas, and, pedro, espinoza, were, actually, more, likely, to, make, an, attempt, on, his, life, than, pinochet, protests, continued, however, during, the, 1980s, leading, to, several, scandals, in, march, 1985, the, murder, of, three, communist, party, members,

a, text, called, el, ladrillo, and, although, chile, grew, very, quickly, between, 1976, and, 1981, at, an, average, of, 7, 2, it, had, a, large, amount, of, debt, which, made, chile, the, most,

continued, after, his, death, led, by, patricio, aylwin, according, to, a, 2020, study, in, the, journal, of, economic, history, pinochet, sold, firms, at, below, market, prices, to, politically, connected, buyers, critics, argue, the, neoliberal, economic, policies, of, the, pinochet, regime, resulted, in, widening, inequality, and, deepening, poverty, as, they, negatively, impacted, the, wages, benefits, and, working, conditions, of, chile, s, working, class, according, to, chilean, economist, alejandro, foxley, by, the, end, of, pinochet, s, reign, around, 44, of, chilean, families, were, living, below, the, poverty, line, according, to, the, shock, doctrine, by, naomi, klein, by, the, late, 1980s, the, economy, had, stabilized, and, was, growing, but, around, 45, of, the, population, had, fallen, into, poverty, while, the, wealthiest, 10, saw, their, incomes, rise, by, 83, but, others, disagree, chilean, economist, jos, pi, era, argues, that, 2, years, after, pinochet, took, power, poverty, was, still, at, 50, and, the, liberal, reforms, reduced, it, to, 7, 8, in, 2013, as, well, as, income, per, capita, rising, from, us, 4, 000, in, 1975, to, us, 25, 000, in, 2015, supporters, of, the, reforms, also, argue, that, when, pinochet, left, power, in, 1990, poverty, had, fallen, to, 38, and, some, claim, that, since, the, consolidation, of, the, neoliberal, system, inequality, has, been, reducing, others, disagree, as, protests, erupted, in, late, 2019, in, response, to, growing, inequality, in, the, country, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, neoliberal, policies, of, the, pinochet, dictatorship, american, scholar, nancy, maclean, wrote, that, the, concentration, of, money, in, the, hands, of, the, very, rich, and, the, perversion, of, democracy, through, the, privatization, of, government, was, always, the, goal, she, contends, this, was, the, effective, meaning, of, the, theoretical, model, known, as, public, choice, whose, architect, james, m, buchanan, traveled, to, chile, and, worked, closely, with, the, pinochet, regime, maclean, s, account, however, has, come, under, scrutiny, economist, andrew, farrant, examined, the, chilean, constitutional, clauses, that, maclean, attributes, to, buchanan, and, discovered, that, they, pre, dated, his, visit, he, concludes, that, evidence, suggests, that, buchanan, s, may, 1980, visit, did, not, particularly, influence, the, subsequent, drafting, of, the, chilean, constitution, and, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, buchanan, had, any, kind, of, audience, with, pinochet, or, corresponded, with, the, chilean, dictator, according, to, the, transitional, provisions, of, the, 1980, constitution, a, referendum, was, scheduled, for, 5, october, 1988, to, vote, on, a, new, eight, year, presidential, term, for, pinochet, confronted, with, increasing, opposition, notably, at, the, international, level, pinochet, legalized, political, parties, in, 1987, and, called, for, a, vote, to, determine, whether, or, not, he, would, remain, in, power, until, 1997, if, the, yes, won, pinochet, would, have, to, implement, the, dispositions, of, the, 1980, constitution, mainly, the, call, for, general, elections, while, he, would, himself, remain, in, power, as, president, if, the, no, won, pinochet, would, remain, president, for, another, year, and, a, joint, presidential, and, legislative, election, would, be, held, another, reason, for, pinochet, s, decision, to, call, for, elections, was, the, april, 1987, visit, of, pope, john, paul, ii, to, chile, according, to, the, us, catholic, author, george, weigel, he, held, a, meeting, with, pinochet, during, which, they, discussed, a, return, to, democracy, john, paul, ii, allegedly, pushed, pinochet, to, accept, a, democratic, opening, of, his, government, and, even, called, for, his, resignation, political, advertising, was, legalized, on, 5, september, 1987, as, a, necessary, element, for, the, campaign, for, the, no, to, the, referendum, which, countered, the, official, campaign, which, presaged, a, return, to, a, popular, unity, government, in, case, of, a, defeat, of, pinochet, the, opposition, gathered, into, the, concertaci, n, de, partidos, por, el, no, coalition, of, parties, for, no, organized, a, colorful, and, cheerful, campaign, under, the, slogan, la, alegr, a, ya, viene, joy, is,

parties, including, the, humanist, party, the, ecologist, party, the, social, democrats, and, several, socialist, party, splinter, groups, added, their, support, on, 5, october, 1988, the, no, option, won, with, 55, 99, of, the, votes, against, 44, 01, of, yes, votes, in, the, wake, of, his, electoral, defeat, pinochet, attempted, to, implement, a, plan, for, an, auto, coup, he, attempted, to, implement, efforts, to, orchestrate, chaos, and, violence, in, the, streets, to, justify, his, power, grab, however, the, carabinero, police, refused, an, order, to, lift, the, cordon, against, street, demonstrations, in, the, capital, according, to, a, cia, informant, in, his, final, move, pinochet, convened, a, meeting, of, his, junta, at, la, moneda, in, which, he, requested, that, they, give, him, extraordinary, powers, to, have, the, military, seize, the, capital, air, force, general, fernando, matthei, refused, saying, that, he, would, not, agree, to, such, a, thing, under, any, circumstances, and, the, rest, of, the, junta, followed, this, stance, on, grounds, that, pinochet, already, had, his, turn, and, lost, matthei, would, later, become, the, first, member, of, the, junta, to, publicly, admit, that, pinochet, had, lost, the, plebiscite, without, any, support, from, the, junta, pinochet, was, forced, to, accept, the, result, the, ensuing, constitutional, process, led, to, presidential, and, legislative, elections, the, following, year, the, coalition, changed, its, name, to, concertaci, n, de, partidos, por, la, democracia, coalition, of, parties, for,

elections, the, opposition, and, the, pinochet, government, made, several, negotiations, to, amend, the, constitution, and, agreed, to, 54, modifications, these, amendments, changed, the, way, the, constitution, would, be, modified, in, the, future, added, restrictions, to, state, of, emergency, dispositions, the, affirmation, of, political, pluralism, and, enhanced, constitutional, rights, as, well, as, the, democratic, principle, and, participation, to, political, life, in, july, 1989, a, referendum, on, the, proposed, changes, took, place, supported, by, all, the, parties, except, the,

was, also, a, third, party, candidate, francisco, javier, err, zuriz, a, wealthy, aristocrat, representing, the, extreme, economic, right, who, garnered, the, remaining, 15, pinochet, thus, left, the,

to, the, binomial, representation, system, included, in, the, constitution, the, elected, senators, did, not, achieve, a, complete, majority, in, parliament, a, situation, that, would, last, for, over, 15, years, this, forced, them, to, negotiate, all, law, projects, with, the, alliance, for, chile, originally, called, democracy, and, progress, and, then, union, for, chile, a, center, right,

doctrinal, advice, and, consultancy, jacobo, timerman, has, called, the, chilean, army, under, pinochet, the, last, prussian, army, in, the, world, suggesting, a, pre, fascist, origin, to, the, model, of, pinochet, s, military, government, historian, alfredo, jocelyn, holt, has, referred, to, pinochet, s, figure, as, totemic, and, added, that, it, serves, as, a, scapegoat, which, attracts, all, hate, gabriel, salazar, also, a, historian, has, lamented, the, lack, of, an, international, condemnation, of, pinochet, in, court, since, according, to, salazar, that, would, have, damaged, his, image, irreparably, and, that, of, the, judicial, system, of, chile, too, in, 1989, indigenous, mapuche, groups, representing, the, consejos, regionales, bestowed, pinochet, the, title, ulmen, f, ta, lonko, or, great, authority, according, to, pinochet, who, was, aware, of, his, ancestry, he, was, taught, the, french, language, by, an, uncle, although, he, later, forgot, most, of, it, pinochet, admired, napoleon, as, the, greatest, among, the, french, and, had, a, framed, picture, of, him, he, also, admired, louis, xiv, pinochet, s, reputation, led, peruvians, in, the, 1990s, to, call, alberto, fujimori, chinochet, instead, of, his, ordinary, nickname, chino, chadian, dictator, hiss, ne, habr, a, cold, war, ally, of, the, west, has, been, characterized, as, africa, s, pinochet, for, ordering, the, torture, and, mass, killing, of, political, opponents, during, his, reign, and, for, the, decades, long, campaign, to, see, him, convicted, of, crimes, against, humanity, images, of, pinochet, have, been, used, in, several, internet, memes, with, the, caption, pinochet, s, free, helicopter, rides, referencing, death, flights, which, saw, political, dissidents, being, thrown, from, helicopters, over, the, pacific, or, the, andes, during, pinochet, s, rule, variations, of, the, internet, meme, have, seen, increased, popularity, with, the, rise, of, far, right, and, alt, right, politics, pinochet, and, his, government, have, been, characterised, as, fascist, for, example, journalist, and, author, samuel, chavkin, in, his, book, storm, over, chile, the, junta, under, siege, repeatedly, characterizes, both, pinochet, himself, and, the, military, dictatorship, as, fascist, however, he, and, his, government, are, generally, excluded, from, academic, typologies, of, fascism, roger, griffin, included, pinochet, in, a, group, of, pseudo, populist, despots, distinct, from, fascism, which, included, the, likes, of, saddam, hussein, suharto, and, ferdinand, marcos, he, argues, that, such, regimes, may, be, considered, populist, ultra, nationalist, but, lack, the, rhetoric, of, national, rebirth, or, palingenesis, necessary, to, make, them, conform, to, the, model, of, palingenetic, ultranationalism, robert, paxton, meanwhile, compared, pinochet, s, regime, to, that, of, mobutu, sese, seko, in, the, former, zaire, now, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, arguing, that, both, were, merely, client, states, that, lacked, popular, acclaim, and, the, ability, to, expand, he, further, argued, that, had, pinochet, attempted, to, build, true, fascism, the, regime, would, likely, have, been, toppled, or, at, least, been, forced, to, alter, its, relationship, to, the, united, states, anna, cento, bull, also, excluded, pinochet, from, fascism, although, she, has, argued, that, his, regime, belongs, to, a, strand, of, cold, war, anti, communism, that, was, happy, to, accommodate, neo, fascist, elements, within, its, activity, world, fascism, a, historical, encyclopedia, notes, that, although, he, was, authoritarian, and, ruled, dictatorially, pinochet, s, support, of, neoliberal, economic, policies, and, his, unwillingness, to, support, national, businesses, distinguished, him, from, classical, fascists, historian, gabriel, salazar, stated, that, high, visibility, of, pinochet, and, neglect, of, co, workers, was, reminiscent, of, fascist, leadership, it, is, notable, that, in, all, the, declarations, of, pinochet, s, men, nobody, has, mentioned, the, creators, of, the, new, chilean, society, and, state, i, haven, t, heard, anybody, mention, jaime, guzm, n, carlos, c, ceres, hern, n, b, chi, sergio, de, castro, there, is, no, mention, of, the, true, brains, or, that, the, whole, of, the, armed, forces, were, involved, in, this, in, dirty, and, symbolic, tasks, everything, is, embodied, in, pinochet, it, s, very, curious, that, figures, of, the, stature, of, b, chi, are, immolated, before, the, figure, of, pinochet, in, what, is, to, me, a, fascist, rite, give, everything, to, the, f, hrer, i, did, it, but, ultimately, it, was, him, pinochet, was, publicly, known, as, a, man, with, a, lack, of, culture, and, this, image, was, reinforced, by, the, fact, that, he, also, portrayed, himself, as, a, common, man, with, simple, ideas, he, was, also, known, for, being, reserved, sharing, little, about, his, opinions, or, feelings, before, wresting, power, from, allende, pinochet, had, written, two, books, geopol, tica, 1968, and, campa, a, de, tarapac, 1972, which, established, him, as, a, major, figure, in, chile, s, military, literature, in, geopol, tica, pinochet, plagiarized, his, mentor, general, gregorio, rodr, guez, tasc, n, by, using, paragraphs, from, a, 1949, conference, presentation, of, rodr, guez, without, attributing, them, to, him, rodr, guez, had, previously, lectured, pinochet, and, ren, schneider, and, carlos, prats, in, geography, and, geopolitics, in, contrast, to, the, two, latter, pinochet, was, not, an, outstanding, student, but, his, persistence, and, interest, in, geopolitics, made, rodr, guez, assume, the, role, as, his, academic, mentor, rodr, guez, granted, pinochet, a, slot, as, assistant, lecturer, in, geopolitics, and, in, geography, according, to, rodr, guez, pinochet, would, have, been, particularly, impressed, by, his, lectures, on, the, art, of, war, pinochet, would, later, succeed, rodr, guez, in, the, geopolitics, and, geography, chair, investigative, journalist, juan, crist, bal, pe, a, has, put, forward, the, thesis, that, pinochet, felt, intellectual, envy, of, carlos, prats, and, that, the, latter, s, assassination, in, 1974, was, a, relief, for, pinochet, during, his, lifetime, pinochet, amassed, more, than, 55, 000, books, in, his, private, library, worth, an, estimated, us, 2, 840, 000, 2006, 07, the, extent, of, his, library, was, revealed, to, the, public, only, after, a, police, inspection, in, january, 2006, pinochet, bought, books,
