rudolf, christian, karl, diesel, english, d, i, z, l, s, l, german, 18, march, 1858, 29, september, 1913, was, a, german, inventor, and, mechanical, engineer, who, invented, the, diesel, engine, which, burns, diesel, fuel, both, are, named, after, him, diesel, was, born, at, 38, rue, notre, dame, de, nazareth, in, paris, france, in, 1858, the, second, of, three, children, of, elise, n, e, strobel, and, theodor, diesel, his, parents, were, bavarian, immigrants, living, in, paris, theodor, diesel, a, bookbinder, by, trade, left, his, home, town, of, augsburg, bavaria, in, 1848, he, met, his, wife, a, daughter, of, a, nuremberg, merchant, in, paris, in, 1855, and, became, a, leather, goods, manufacturer, there, shortly, after, his, birth, diesel, was, given, away, to, a, vincennes, farmer, family, where, he, spent, his, first, nine, months, when, he, was, returned, to, his, family, they, moved, into, the, flat, 49, in, the, rue, de, la, fontaine, au, roi, at, the, time, the, diesel, family, suffered, from, financial, difficulties, thus, young, rudolf, diesel, had, to, work, in, his, father, s, workshop, and, deliver, leather, goods, to, customers, using, a, barrow, he, attended, a, protestant, french, school, and, soon, became, interested, in, social, questions, and, technology, being, a, very, good, student, 12, year, old, diesel, received, the, soci, t, pour, l, instruction, el, mentaire, bronze, medal, and, had, plans, to, enter, ecole, primaire, sup, rieure, in, 1870, at, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, the, same, year, his, family, were, deported, to, england, settling, in, london, where, diesel, attended, an, english, speaking, school, before, the, war, s, end, however, diesel, s, mother, sent, 12, year, old, rudolf, to, augsburg, to, live, with, his, aunt, and, uncle, barbara, and, christoph, barnickel, to, become, fluent, in, german, and, to, visit, the, k, nigliche, kreis, gewerbeschule, royal, county, vocational, college, where, his, uncle, taught, mathematics, he, was, enrolled, at, the, technische, hochschule, tehnical, high, school, at, the, age, of, 14, diesel, wrote, a, letter, to, his, parents, saying, that, he, intended, to, become, an, engineer, after, finishing, his, basic, education, at, the, top, of, his, class, in, 1873, he, enrolled, at, the, newly, founded, industrial, school, of, augsburg, two, years, later, he, received, a, merit, scholarship, from, the, royal, bavarian, polytechnic, of, munich, which, he, accepted, against, the, wishes, of, his, parents, who, wanted, him, to, begin, working, instead, one, of, diesel, s, professors, in, munich, was, carl, von, linde, diesel, was, unable, to, graduate, with, his, class, in, july, 1879, because, he, fell, ill, with, typhoid, fever, while, waiting, for, the, next, examination, date, he, gained, practical, engineering, experience, at, the, sulzer, brothers, machine, works, in, winterthur, switzerland, diesel, graduated, in, january, 1880, with, highest, academic, honours, and, returned, to, paris, where, he, assisted, linde, with, the, design, and, construction, of, a, modern, refrigeration, and, ice, plant, diesel, became, the, director, of, the, plant, a, year, afterwards, in, 1883, diesel, married, martha, flasche, and, continued, to, work, for, linde, gaining, numerous, patents, in, both, germany, and, france, in, early, 1890, diesel, moved, to, berlin, with, his, wife, and, children, rudolf, jr, heddy, and, eugen, to, assume, management, of, linde, s, corporate, research, and, development, department, and, to, join, several, other, corporate, boards, since, he, was, not, allowed, to, use, for, his, own, purposes, the, patents, he, developed, while, an, employee, of, linde, s, he, expanded, beyond, the, field, of, refrigeration, he, first, worked, with, steam, his, research, into, thermal, efficiency, and, fuel, efficiency, leading, him, to, build, a, steam, engine, using, ammonia, vapor, during, tests, however, the, engine, exploded, and, almost, killed, him, his, research, into, high, compression, cylinder, pressures, tested, the, strength, of, iron, and, steel, cylinder, heads, one, exploded, during, a, test, run, he, spent, many, months, in, a, hospital, followed, by, health, and, eyesight, problems, it, was, during, this, year, that, diesel, began, conceptualising, the, idea, of, a, diesel, engine, ever, since, attending, lectures, of, von, linde, diesel, worked, on, designing, an, internal, combustion, engine, that, could, approach, the, maximum, theoretical, thermal, efficiency, of, the, carnot, cycle, in, 1892, after, working, on, this, idea, for, several, years, he, considered, his, theory, to, be, completed, in, the, same, year, diesel, was, given, the, german, patent, drp, 67207, in, 1893, he, published, a, treatise, entitled, theory, and, construction, of, a, rational, heat, engine, to, replace, the, steam, engine, and, the, combustion, engines, known, today, that, he, had, been, working, on, since, early, 1892, this, treatise, formed, the, basis, for, his, work, on, and, development, of, the, diesel, engine, by, summer, 1893, diesel, had, realised, that, his, initial, theory, was, erroneous, leading, him, to, file, another, patent, application, for, the, corrected, theory, in, 1893, diesel, understood, thermodynamics, and, the, theoretical, and, practical, constraints, on, fuel, efficiency, he, knew, that, as, much, as, 90, of, the, energy, available, in, the, fuel, is, wasted, in, a, steam, engine, his, work, in, engine, design, was, driven, by, the, goal, of, much, higher, efficiency, ratios, as, opposed, to, outside, ignition, applied, against, internal, air, and, fuel, mixture, air, was, compressed, internally, within, the, cylinder, whilst, heating, in, order, for, the, fuel, to, establish, contact, the, air, immediately, before, the, compression, period, would, end, thus, igniting, on, its, own, therefore, the, engine, was, smaller, and, weighed, less, than, most, contemporary, steam, engines, not, to, mention, the, fact, that, further, fuel, sources, weren, t, required, fuel, efficiency, was, measured, 75, above, the, 10, theoretical, efficiency, for, steam, engines, in, his, engine, fuel, was, injected, at, the, end, of, the, compression, stroke, and, was, ignited, by, the, high, temperature, resulting, from, the, compression, from, 1893, to, 1897, heinrich, von, buz, director, of, maschinenfabrik, augsburg, in, augsburg, provided, rudolf, diesel, the, opportunity, to, test, and, develop, his, ideas, diesel, also, received, support, from, the, krupp, firm, diesel, s, design, utilised, compression, ignition, as, opposed, to, using, spark, plugs, similar, to, gas, engines, with, the, ability, to, be, ran, on, biodiesel, if, not, petroleum, originating, fuels, compression, engines, are, circa, 30, more, efficient, over, conventional, gas, burning, engines, being, mixed, through, forced, compressed, air, within, the, combustion, chamber, leading, to, a, higher, internal, temperature, expanding, at, a, higher, rate, and, placing, further, pressure, over, the, pistons, that, rotate, the, crankshaft, towards, a, quicker, rate, biodiesel, often, composed, of, synthesis, gas, originating, from, waste, cellulose, gasification, as, well, as, extraction, of, lipids, from, algae, most, frequently, used, by, consisting, vegetable, oils, and, algae, together, under, methanol, transesterification, numerous, firms, have, developed, different, techniques, in, order, to, achieve, such, the, first, successful, diesel, engine, motor, 250, 400, was, officially, tested, in, 1897, featuring, a, 25, horsepower, four, stroke, single, vertical, cylinder, compression, having, just, revolutionised, the, engine, manufacturing, industry, it, became, an, immediate, success, with, royalties, amassing, great, wealth, for, diesel, the, engine, is, currently, on, display, at, the, german, technical, museum, in, munich, besides, germany, diesel, obtained, patents, for, his, design, in, other, countries, including, the, united, states, he, was, inducted, into, the, automotive, hall, of, fame, in, 1978, on, the, evening, of, 29, september, 1913, diesel, boarded, the, great, eastern, railway, steamer, ss, dresden, in, antwerp, on, his, way, to, a, meeting, of, the, consolidated, diesel, manufacturing, company, in, london, he, took, dinner, on, board, the, ship, and, then, retired, to, his, cabin, at, about, 10, p, m, leaving, word, to, be, called, the, next, morning, at, 6, 15, a, m, but, he, was, never, seen, alive, again, in, the, morning, his, cabin, was, empty, and, his, bed, had, not, been, slept, in, although, his, nightshirt, was, neatly, laid, out, and, his, watch, had, been, left, where, it, could, be, seen, from, the, bed, his, hat, and, neatly, folded, overcoat, were, discovered, beneath, the, afterdeck, railing, shortly, after, diesel, s, disappearance, his, wife, martha, opened, a, bag, that, her, husband, had, given, to, her, just, before, his, ill, fated, voyage, with, directions, that, it, should, not, be, opened, until, the, following, week, she, discovered, 20, 000, german, marks, in, cash, us, 120, 000, today, and, financial, statements, indicating, that, their, bank, accounts, were, virtually, empty, in, a, diary, diesel, brought, with, him, on, the, ship, for, the, date, 29, september, 1913, a, cross, was, drawn, possibly, indicating, death, ten, days, after, he, was, last, seen, the, crew, of, the, dutch, pilot, boat, coertsen, came, upon, the, corpse, of, a, man, floating, in, the, eastern, scheldt, the, body, was, in, such, an, advanced, state, of, decomposition, that, it, was, unrecognisable, and, they, did, not, retain, it, aboard, because, of, heavy, weather, instead, the, crew, retrieved, personal, items, pill, case, wallet, i, d, card, pocketknife, eyeglass, case, from, the, clothing, of, the, dead, man, and, returned, the, body, to, the, sea, on, 13, october, these, items, were, identified, by, rudolf, s, son, eugen, diesel, as, belonging, to, his, father, there, are, various, theories, to, explain, diesel, s, death, some, such, as, diesel, s, biographers, grosser, 1978, and, sittauer, 1978, have, argued, that, he, committed, suicide, another, line, of, thought, suggests, that, he, was, murdered, given, his, refusal, to, grant, the, german, forces, the, exclusive, rights, to, using, his, invention, indeed, diesel, had, boarded, dresden, with, the, intent, of, meeting, with, representatives, of, the, royal, navy, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, powering, british, submarines, by, diesel, engine, another, theory, is, that, his, apparent, death, was, a, ruse, staged, by, the, british, government, to, cover, his, defection, to, the, british, cause, and, that, he, then, went, to, canada, worked, for, the, vickers, shipyard, in, montreal, and, was, responsible, for, a, sudden, acceleration, in, its, ability, to, produce, a, successful, diesel, engine, for, submarines, given, the, limited, evidence, at, hand, his, disappearance, and, death, remain, unsolved, in, 1950, magokichi, yamaoka, the, founder, of, yanmar, the, diesel, engine, manufacturer, in, japan, visited, west, germany, and, learned, that, there, was, no, tomb, or, monument, for, diesel, yamaoka, and, people, associated, with, diesel, began, to, make, preparations, to, honour, him, in, 1957, on, the, occasion, of, the, 100th, anniversary, of, diesel, s, birth, and, the, 60th, anniversary, of, the, diesel, engine, development, yamaoka, dedicated, the, rudolf, diesel, memorial, garden, rudolf, diesel, ged, chtnishain, in, wittelsbacher, park, in, augsburg, bavaria, where, diesel, had, undertaken, his, early, technical, education, and, original, engine, development, after, diesel, s, death, his, engine, underwent, much, development, and, became, a, very, important, replacement, for, the, steam, piston, engine, in, many, applications, because, the, diesel, engine, required, a, more, robust, construction, than, a, gasoline, engine, it, saw, limited, use, in, aviation, however, the, diesel, engine, became, widespread, in, many, other, applications, such, as, stationary, engines, agricultural, machines, and, off, highway, machinery, in, general, submarines, ships, and, much, later, locomotives, trucks, and, in, modern, automobiles, diesel, engines, have, the, benefit, of, running, more, fuel, efficiently, than, any, other, internal, combustion, engines, suited, for, motor, vehicles, allowing, more, heat, to, be, converted, to, mechanical, work, diesel, was, interested, in, using, coal, dust, or, vegetable, oil, as, fuel, and, in, fact, his, engine, was, run, on, peanut, oil, although, these, fuels, were, not, better, replacements, in, 2008, the, rise, in, fuel, prices, coupled, with, concerns, about, remaining, petroleum, reserves, led, to, the, more, widespread, use, of, vegetable, oil, and, biodiesel, the, primary, fuel, used, in, diesel, engines, is, the, eponymous, diesel, fuel, derived, from, the, refinement, of, crude, oil, diesel, is, safer, to, store, than, gasoline, because, its, flash, point, is, approximately, 79, 4, c, 174, 9, f, higher, and, it, will, not, explode, in, a, book, titled, diesel, engines, for, land, and, marine, work, diesel, said, that, in, 1900, a, small, diesel, engine, was, exhibited, by, the, otto, company, which, on, the, suggestion, of, the, french, government, was, run, on, arachide, oil, and, operated, so, well, that, very, few, people, were, aware, of, the, fact, the, motor, was, built, for, ordinary, oils, and, without, any, modification, was, run, on, vegetable, oil, i, have, recently, repeated, these, experiments, on, a, large, scale, with, full, success, and, entire, confirmation, of, the, results, formerly, obtained
