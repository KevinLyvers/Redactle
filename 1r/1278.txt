have, no, more, children, leaving, henry, without, a, legitimate, male, heir, in, 1525, henry, sent, mary, to, the, border, of, wales, to, preside, presumably, in, name, only, over, the, council, of,

called, her, the, princess, of, wales, although, she, was, never, technically, invested, with, the, title, she, appears, to, have, spent, three, years, in, the, welsh, marches, making, regular, visits, to, her, father, s, court, before, returning, permanently, to, the, home, counties, around, london, in, mid, 1528, throughout, mary, s, childhood, henry, negotiated, potential, future, marriages, for, her, when, she, was, only, two, years, old, mary, was, promised, to, francis, dauphin, of, france, the, infant, son, of, king, francis, i, but, the, contract, was, repudiated, after, three, years, in, 1522, at, the, age, of, six, she, was, instead, contracted, to, marry, her, 22, year, old, cousin, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, however, charles, broke, off, the, engagement, within, a, few, years, with, henry, s, agreement, cardinal, wolsey, henry, s, chief, adviser, then, resumed, marriage, negotiations, with, the, french, and, henry, suggested, that, mary, marry, the, french, king, francis, i, who, was, eager, for, an, alliance, with, england, a, marriage, treaty, was, signed, which, provided, that, mary, marry, either, francis, i, or, his, second, son, henri, duke, of, orleans, but, wolsey, secured, an, alliance, with, france, without, the, marriage, in, 1528, wolsey, s, agent, thomas, magnus, discussed, the, idea, of, her, marriage, to, her, cousin, james, v, of, scotland, with, the, scottish, diplomat, adam, otterburn, according, to, the, venetian, mario, savorgnano, by, this, time, mary, was, developing, into, a, pretty, well, proportioned, young, lady, with, a, fine, complexion, although, various, possibilities, for, mary, s, marriage, had, been, considered, the, marriage, of, mary, s, parents, was, itself, in, jeopardy, which, threatened, her, status, disappointed, at, the, lack, of, a, male, heir, and, eager, to, remarry, henry, attempted, to, have, his, marriage, to, catherine, annulled, but, pope, clement, vii, refused, his, request, henry, claimed, citing, biblical, passages, leviticus, 20, 21, that, the, marriage, was, unclean, because, catherine, was, the, widow, of, his, brother, arthur, prince, of, wales, mary, s, uncle, catherine, claimed, that, her, marriage, to, arthur, was, never, consummated, and, so, was, not, a, valid, marriage, pope, julius, ii, had, issued, a, dispensation, on, that, basis, clement, vii, may, have, been, reluctant, to, act, because, he, was, influenced, by, charles, v, catherine, s, nephew, and, mary, s, former, betrothed, whose, troops, had, surrounded, and, occupied, rome, in, the, war, of, the, league, of, cognac, from, 1531, mary, was, often, sick, with, irregular, menstruation, and, depression, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, this, was, caused, by, stress, puberty, or, a, more, deep, seated, disease, she, was, not, permitted, to, see, her, mother, whom, henry, had, sent, to, live, away, from, court, in, early, 1533, henry, married, anne, boleyn, and, in, may, thomas, cranmer, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, formally, declared, the, marriage, with, catherine, void, and, the, marriage, to, anne, valid, henry, repudiated, the, pope, s, authority, declaring, himself, supreme, head, of, the, church, of, england, catherine, was, demoted, to, dowager, princess, of, wales, a, title, she, would, have, held, as, arthur, s, widow, and, mary, was, deemed, illegitimate, she, was, styled, the, lady, mary, rather, than, princess, and, her, place, in, the, line, of, succession, was, transferred, to, henry, and, anne, s, newborn, daughter, elizabeth, mary, s, household, was, dissolved, her, servants, including, the, countess, of, salisbury, were, dismissed, and, in, december, 1533, she, was, sent, to, join, her, infant, half, sister, s, household, at, hatfield, palace, hertfordshire, mary, determinedly, refused, to, acknowledge, that, anne, was, the, queen, or, that, elizabeth, was, a, princess, enraging, king, henry, under, strain, and, with, her, movements, restricted, mary, was, frequently, ill, which, the, royal, physician, attributed, to, her, ill, treatment, the, imperial, ambassador, eustace, chapuys, became, her, close, adviser, and, interceded, unsuccessfully, on, her, behalf, at, court, the, relationship, between, mary, and, her, father, worsened, they, did, not, speak, to, each, other, for, three, years, although, both, she, and, her, mother, were, ill, mary, was, refused, permission, to, visit, catherine, when, catherine, died, in, 1536, mary, was, inconsolable, catherine, was, interred, in, peterborough, cathedral, while, mary, grieved, in, semi, seclusion, at, hunsdon, in, hertfordshire, in, 1536, queen, anne, fell, from, the, king, s, favour, and, was, beheaded, elizabeth, like, mary, was, declared, illegitimate, and, stripped, of, her, succession, rights, within, two, weeks, of, anne, s, execution, henry, married, jane, seymour, who, urged, her, husband, to, make, peace, with, mary, henry, insisted, that, mary, recognise, him, as, head, of, the, church, of, england, repudiate, papal, authority, acknowledge, that, the, marriage, between, her, parents, was, unlawful, and, accept, her, own, illegitimacy, she, attempted, to, reconcile, with, henry, by, submitting, to, his, authority, as, far, as, god, and, my, conscience, permitted, but, was, eventually, bullied, into, signing, a, document, agreeing, to, all, of, henry, s, demands, reconciled, with, her, father, mary, resumed, her, place, at, court, henry, granted, her, a, household, which, included, the, reinstatement, of, mary, s, favourite, susan, clarencieux, mary, s, privy, purse, accounts, for, this, period, kept, by, mary, finch, show, that, hatfield, house, the, palace, of, beaulieu, also, called, newhall, richmond, and, hunsdon, were, among, her, principal, places, of, residence, as, well, as, henry, s, palaces, at, greenwich, westminster, and, hampton, court, her, expenses, included, fine, clothes, and, gambling, at, cards, one, of, her, favourite, pastimes, rebels, in, the, north, of, england, including, lord, hussey, mary, s, former, chamberlain, campaigned, against, henry, s, religious, reforms, and, one, of, their, demands, was, that, mary, be, made, legitimate, the, rebellion, known, as, the, pilgrimage, of, grace, was, ruthlessly, suppressed, along, with, other, rebels, hussey, was, executed, but, there, is, no, suggestion, that, mary, was, directly, involved, in, 1537, queen, jane, died, after, giving, birth, to, a, son, edward, mary, was, made, godmother, to, her, half, brother, and, acted, as, chief, mourner, at, the, queen, s, funeral, mary, was, courted, by, philip, duke, of, bavaria, from, late, 1539, but, he, was, lutheran, and, his, suit, for, her, hand, was, unsuccessful, over, 1539, the, king, s, chief, minister, thomas, cromwell, negotiated, a, potential, alliance, with, the, duchy, of, cleves, suggestions, that, mary, marry, william, i, duke, of, cleves, who, was, the, same, age, came, to, nothing, but, a, match, between, henry, and, the, duke, s, sister, anne, was, agreed, when, the, king, saw, anne, for, the, first, time, in, late, december, 1539, a, week, before, the, scheduled, wedding, he, found, her, unattractive, but, was, unable, for, diplomatic, reasons, and, without, a, suitable, pretext, to, cancel, the, marriage, cromwell, fell, from, favour, and, was, arrested, for, treason, in, june, 1540, one, of, the, unlikely, charges, against, him, was, that, he, had, plotted, to, marry, mary, himself, anne, consented, to, the, annulment, of, the, marriage, which, had, not, been, consummated, and, cromwell, was, beheaded, in, 1541, henry, had, the, countess, of, salisbury, mary, s, old, governess, and, godmother, executed,

to, bring, the, family, closer, together, henry, returned, mary, and, elizabeth, to, the, line, of, succession, through, the, act, of, succession, 1544, also, known, as, the, third, succession, act, placing, them, after, edward, though, both, remained, legally, illegitimate, henry, viii, died, in, 1547, and, edward, succeeded, him, mary, inherited, estates, in, norfolk, suffolk, and, essex, and, was, granted, hunsdon, and, beaulieu, as, her, own, since, edward, was, still, a, child, rule, passed, to, a, regency, council, dominated, by, protestants, who, attempted, to, establish, their, faith, throughout, the, country, for, example, the, act, of, uniformity, 1549, prescribed, protestant, rites, for, church, services, such, as, the, use, of, thomas, cranmer, s, book, of, common, prayer, mary, remained, faithful, to, roman, catholicism, and, defiantly, celebrated, traditional, mass, in, her, own, chapel, she, appealed, to, her, cousin, emperor, charles, v, to, apply, diplomatic, pressure, demanding, that, she, be, allowed, to, practise, her, religion, for, most, of, edward, s, reign, mary, remained, on, her, own, estates, and, rarely, attended, court, a, plan, between, may, and, july, 1550, to, smuggle, her, out, of, england, to, the, safety, of, the, european, mainland, came, to, nothing, religious, differences, between, mary, and, edward, continued, mary, attended, a, reunion, with, edward, and, elizabeth, for, christmas, 1550, where, the, 13, year, old, edward, embarrassed, mary, then, 34, and, reduced, both, her, and, himself, to, tears, in, front, of, the, court, by, publicly, reproving, her, for, ignoring, his, laws, regarding, worship, mary, repeatedly, refused, edward, s, demands, that, she, abandon, catholicism, and, edward, persistently, refused, to, drop, his, demands, on, 6, july, 1553, at, the, age, of, 15, edward, vi, died, of, a, lung, infection, possibly, tuberculosis, he, did, not, want, the, crown, to, go, to, mary, because, he, feared, she, would, restore, catholicism, and, undo, his, and, their, father, s, reforms, and, so, he, planned, to, exclude, her, from, the, line, of, succession, his, advisers, told, him, that, he, could, not, disinherit, only, one, of, his, half, sisters, he, would, have, to, disinherit, elizabeth, as, well, even, though, she, was, a, protestant, guided, by, john, dudley, 1st, duke, of, northumberland, and, perhaps, others, edward, excluded, both, from, the, line, of, succession, in, his, will, contradicting, the, act, of, succession, 1544, which, restored, mary, and, elizabeth, to, the, line, of, succession, edward, named, northumberland, s, daughter, in, law, lady, jane, grey, the, granddaughter, of, henry, viii, s, younger, sister, mary, as, his, successor, lady, jane, s, mother, was, frances, brandon, mary, s, cousin, and, goddaughter, just, before, edward, s, death, mary, was, summoned, to, london, to, visit, her, dying, brother, but, was, warned, that, the, summons, was, a, pretext, on, which, to, capture, her, and, thereby, facilitate, jane, s, accession, to, the, throne, therefore, instead, of, heading, to, london, from, her, residence, at, hunsdon, mary, fled, to, east, anglia, where, she, owned, extensive, estates, and, northumberland, had, ruthlessly, put, down, kett, s, rebellion, many, adherents, to, the, catholic, faith, opponents, of, northumberland, lived, there, on, 9, july, from, kenninghall, norfolk, she, wrote, to, the, privy, council, with, orders, for, her, proclamation, as, edward, s, successor, on, 10, july, 1553, lady, jane, was, proclaimed, queen, by, northumberland, and, his, supporters, and, on, the, same, day, mary, s, letter, to, the, council, arrived, in, london, by, 12, july, mary, and, her, supporters, had, assembled, a, military, force, at, framlingham, castle, suffolk, northumberland, s, support, collapsed, and, jane, was, deposed, on, 19, july, she, and, northumberland, were, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, mary, rode, triumphantly, into, london, on, 3, august, 1553, on, a, wave, of, popular, support, she, was, accompanied, by, her, half, sister, elizabeth, and, a, procession, of, over, 800, nobles, and, gentlemen, one, of, mary, s, first, actions, as, queen, was, to, order, the, release, of, the, roman, catholic, thomas, howard, 3rd, duke, of, norfolk, and, stephen, gardiner, from, imprisonment, in, the, tower, of, london, as, well, as, her, kinsman, edward, courtenay, mary, understood, that, the, young, lady, jane, was, essentially, a, pawn, in, northumberland, s, scheme, and, northumberland, was, the, only, conspirator, of, rank, executed, for, high, treason, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, attempted, coup, lady, jane, and, her, husband, lord, guildford, dudley, though, found, guilty, were, kept, under, guard, in, the, tower, rather, than, immediately, executed, while, lady, jane, s, father, henry, grey, 1st, duke, of, suffolk, was, released, mary, was, left, in, a, difficult, position, as, almost, all, the, privy, counsellors, had, been, implicated, in, the, plot, to, put, lady, jane, on, the, throne, she, appointed, gardiner, to, the, council, and, made, him, both, bishop, of, winchester, and, lord, chancellor, offices, he, held, until, his, death, in, november, 1555, susan, clarencieux, became, mistress, of, the, robes, on, 1, october, 1553, gardiner, crowned, mary, at, westminster, abbey, now, aged, 37, mary, turned, her, attention, to, finding, a, husband, and, producing, an, heir, which, would, prevent, the, protestant, elizabeth, still, next, in, line, under, the, terms, of, henry, viii, s, will, and, the, act, of, succession, of, 1544, from, succeeding, to, the, throne, while, the, english, expected, her, to, marry, there, was, a, general, consensus, that, the, queen, should, not, marry, a, foreigner, since, that, could, lead, to, the, interference, of, a, foreign, power, in, english, affairs, on, 16, november, 1553, a, parliamentary, delegation, went, to, her, and, formally, requested, that, she, choose, an, english, husband, with, its, obvious, although, tacit, candidates, being, her, kinsmen, edward, courtenay, recently, created, earl, of, devon, and, the, catholic, cardinal, reginald, pole, but, mary, s, first, cousin, charles, v, also, king, of, spain, saw, that, an, alliance, with, england, would, give, him, supremacy, in, europe, he, sent, his, minister, to, england, to, propose, his, only, legitimate, son, philip, as, a, person, whom, the, religious, and, political, interests, of, the, world, recommended, for, mary, the, spanish, prince, had, been, widowed, a, few, years, before, by, the, death, of, his, first, wife, maria, manuela, of, portugal, mother, of, his, son, carlos, and, was, the, heir, apparent, to, vast, territories, in, continental, europe, and, the, new, world, both, philip, and, mary, were, descendants, of, john, of, gaunt, as, part, of, the, marriage, negotiations, a, portrait, of, philip, by, titian, was, sent, to, mary, in, the, latter, half, of, 1553, mary, was, convinced, that, the, safety, of, england, required, her, to, form, a, closer, relationship, with, charles, s, family, the, habsburgs, and, she, decided, to, marry, philip, a, marriage, treaty, was, presented, to, the, privy, council, on, 7, december, 1553, and, even, though, the, terms, clearly, favoured, england, and, included, several, safeguards, many, still, thought, that, england, would, be, drawn, into, philip, s, wars, and, become, a, mere, province, of, the, habsburg, empire, this, was, of, particular, concern, to, the, landed, gentry, and, parliamentary, classes, who, foresaw, having, to, pay, greater, taxes, to, cover, the, cost, of, england, s, participation, in, foreign, wars, lord, chancellor, gardiner, and, the, english, house, of, commons, unsuccessfully, petitioned, mary, to, consider, marrying, an, englishman, fearing, that, england, would, be, relegated, to, a, dependency, of, the, habsburgs, the, marriage, was, unpopular, with, the, english, gardiner, and, his, allies, opposed, it, on, the, basis, of, patriotism, while, protestants, were, motivated, by, a, fear, that, with, the, restoration, of, catholicism, and, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, king, the, inquisition, would, come, after, him, to, judge, protestant, heretics, many, english, people, knew, the, stories, of, the, torments, and, cruelties, suffered, by, the, prisoners, of, the, inquisition, and, there, were, even, those, who, had, suffered, from, the, rack, of, the, inquisitors, themselves, it, was, not, just, the, english, who, were, alarmed, by, the, pending, marriage, of, mary, and, philip, france, feared, an, alliance, between, england, and, spain, antoine, de, noailles, the, french, ambassador, to, england, threatened, war, and, began, immediate, intrigues, with, any, malcontents, he, could, find, before, christmas, in, 1553, anti, spanish, ballads, and, broadsheets, were, circulating, in, the, streets, of, london, when, mary, insisted, on, marrying, philip, insurrections, broke, out, thomas, wyatt, the, younger, led, a, force, from, kent, to, depose, mary, in, favour, of, elizabeth, as, part, of, a, wider, conspiracy, now, known, as, wyatt, s, rebellion, which, also, involved, the, duke, of, suffolk, lady, jane, s, father, mary, declared, publicly, that, she, would, summon, parliament, to, discuss, the, marriage, and, if, parliament, decided, that, the, marriage, was, not, to, the, kingdom, s, advantage, she, would, refrain, from, pursuing, it, on, reaching, london, wyatt, was, defeated, and, captured, wyatt, the, duke, of, suffolk, lady, jane, and, her, husband, guildford, dudley, were, executed, courtenay, who, was, implicated, in, the, plot, was, imprisoned, and, then, exiled, elizabeth, though, protesting, her, innocence, in, the, wyatt, affair, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, for, two, months, then, put, under, house, arrest, at, woodstock, palace, mary, was, excluding, the, brief, disputed, reigns, of, the, empress, matilda, and, lady, jane, grey, england, s, first, queen, regnant, further, under, the, english, common, law, doctrine, of, jure, uxoris, the, property, and, titles, belonging, to, a, woman, became, her, husband, s, upon, marriage, and, it, was, feared, that, any, man, she, married, would, thereby, become, king, of, england, in, fact, and, name, while, mary, s, grandparents, ferdinand, and, isabella, had, retained, sovereignty, of, their, respective, realms, during, their, marriage, there, was, no, precedent, to, follow, in, england, under, the, terms, of, queen, mary, s, marriage, act, philip, was, to, be, styled, king, of, england, all, official, documents, including, acts, of, parliament, were, to, be, dated, with, both, their, names, and, parliament, was, to, be, called, under, the, joint, authority, of, the, couple, for, mary, s, lifetime, only, england, would, not, be, obliged, to, provide, military, support, to, philip, s, father, in, any, war, and, philip, could, not, act, without, his, wife, s, consent, or, appoint, foreigners, to, office, in, england, philip, was, unhappy, with, these, conditions, but, ready, to, agree, for, the, sake, of, securing, the, marriage, he, had, no, amorous, feelings, for, mary, and, sought, the, marriage, for, its, political, and, strategic, gains, his, aide, ruy, g, mez, de, silva, wrote, to, a, correspondent, in, brussels, the, marriage, was, concluded, for, no, fleshly, consideration, but, in, order, to, remedy, the,

released, from, house, arrest, and, called, to, court, as, a, witness, to, the, birth, which, was, expected, imminently, according, to, giovanni, michieli, the, venetian, ambassador, philip, may, have, planned, to, marry, elizabeth, in, the, event, of, mary, s, death, in, childbirth, but, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, in, law, maximilian, of, austria, philip, expressed, uncertainty, as, to, whether, mary, was, pregnant, mary, s, pregnancy, had, its, pros, and, cons, for, elizabeth, if, mary, died, during, childbirth, elizabeth, would, become, the, new, queen, however, if, her, sister,

dismissively, ridiculed, the, pregnancy, as, more, likely, to, end, in, wind, rather, than, anything, else, it, was, most, likely, a, false, pregnancy, perhaps, induced, by, mary, s, overwhelming, desire, to, have, a, child, in, august, soon, after, the, disgrace, of, the, false, pregnancy, which, mary, considered, god, s, punishment, for, her, having, tolerated, heretics, in, her, realm,

marquess, of, winchester, as, lord, high, treasurer, and, assigned, him, to, oversee, the, revenue, collection, system, a, failure, to, apply, new, tariffs, to, new, forms, of, imports, meant, that,

bishop, of, winchester, praised, mary, at, her, funeral, service, she, was, a, king, s, daughter, she, was, a, king, s, sister, she, was, a, king, s, wife, she, was, a, queen, and, by, the, same, title, a, king, also, she, was, the, first, woman, to, successfully, claim, the, throne, of, england, despite, competing, claims, and, determined, opposition, and, enjoyed, popular, support, and, sympathy, during, the, earliest, parts, of, her, reign, especially, from, the, roman, catholics, of, england, protestant, writers, at, the, time, and, since, have, often, condemned, mary, s, reign, by, the, 17th, century, the, memory, of, her, religious, persecutions, had, led, to, the, adoption, of, her, sobriquet, bloody, mary, john, knox, attacked, mary, in, his, first, blast, of, the, trumpet, against, the, monstrous, regiment, of, women, 1558, and, john, foxe, vilified, her, prominently, in, actes, and, monuments, 1563, foxe, s, book, remained, popular, throughout, the, following, centuries, and, helped, shape, enduring, perceptions, of, mary, as, a, bloodthirsty, tyrant, historian, lucy, wooding, notes, misogynistic, undertones, in, descriptions, of, mary, she, s, simultaneously, being, lambasted, for, being, vindictive, and, fierce, and, spineless, and, weak, criticized, for, such, actions, as, showing, clemency, to, political, prisoners, and, yielding, authority, to, her, husband, mary, is, remembered, in, the, 21st, century, for, her, vigorous, efforts, to, restore, the, primacy, of, roman, catholicism, in, england, after, the, rise, of, protestant, influence, during, the, previous, reigns, protestant, historians, have, long, deplored, her, reign, emphasizing, that, in, just, five, years, she, burned, several, hundred, protestants, at, the, stake, in, the, mid, 20th, century, h, f, m, prescott, attempted, to, redress, the, tradition, that, mary, was, intolerant, and, authoritarian, and, scholarship, since, then, has, tended, to, view, the, older, simpler, assessments, of, mary, with, increasing, reservations, a, historiographical, revisionism, since, the, 1980s, has, improved, her, reputation, among, scholars, to, some, degree, christopher, haigh, argued, that, her, revival, of, religious, festivities, and, catholic, practices, was, generally, welcomed, haigh, concluded, that, the, last, years, of, mary, s, reign, were, not, a, gruesome, preparation, for, protestant, victory, but, a, continuing, consolidation, of, catholic, strength, english, catholics, often, remembered, mary, favourably, decades, after, her, death, the, epitaph, for, john, throckmorton, refers, to, queene, marie, of, happie, memorie, catholic, historians, such, as, john, lingard, thought, mary, s, policies, failed, not, because, they, were, wrong, but, because, she, had, too, short, a, reign, to, establish, them, and, because, of, natural, disasters, beyond, her, control, in, other, countries, the, catholic, counter, reformation, was, spearheaded, by, jesuit, missionaries, but, mary, s, chief, religious, advisor, cardinal, reginald, pole, refused, to, allow, the, jesuits, into, england, her, marriage, to, philip, was, unpopular, among, her, subjects, and, her, religious, policies, resulted, in, deep, seated, resentment, the, military, loss, of, calais, to, france, was, a, bitter, humiliation, to, english, pride, failed, harvests, increased, public, discontent, philip, spent, most, of, his, time, abroad, while, his, wife, remained, in, england, leaving, her, depressed, at, his, absence, and, undermined, by, their, inability, to, have, children, after, mary, s, death, philip, sought, to, marry, elizabeth, but, she, refused, him, although, mary, s, rule, was, ultimately, ineffectual, and, unpopular, the, policies, of, fiscal, reform, naval, expansion, and, colonial, exploration, that, were, later, lauded, as, elizabethan, accomplishments, were, started, in, mary, s, reign, when, mary, ascended, the,

fleurs, de, lys, or, and, gules, three, lions, passant, guardant, in, pale, or, for, england, sometimes, her, arms, were, impaled, depicted, side, by, side, with, those, of, her, husband, she,
