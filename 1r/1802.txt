carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, d, k, o, b, i, german, 10, december, 1804, 18, february, 1851, was, a, german, mathematician, who, made, fundamental, contributions, to, elliptic, functions, dynamics, differential, equations, determinants, and, number, theory, jacobi, was, born, of, ashkenazi, jewish, parentage, in, potsdam, on, 10, december, 1804, he, was, the, second, of, four, children, of, a, banker, simon, jacobi, his, elder, brother, moritz, would, also, become, known, later, as, an, engineer, and, physicist, he, was, initially, home, schooled, by, his, uncle, lehman, who, instructed, him, in, the, classical, languages, and, elements, of, mathematics, in, 1816, the, twelve, year, old, jacobi, went, to, the, potsdam, gymnasium, where, students, were, taught, all, the, standard, subjects, classical, languages, history, philology, mathematics, sciences, etc, as, a, result, of, the, good, education, he, had, received, from, his, uncle, as, well, as, his, own, remarkable, abilities, after, less, than, half, a, year, jacobi, was, moved, to, the, senior, year, despite, his, young, age, however, as, the, university, would, not, accept, students, younger, than, 16, years, old, he, had, to, remain, in, the, senior, class, until, 1821, he, used, this, time, to, advance, his, knowledge, showing, interest, in, all, subjects, including, latin, greek, philology, history, and, mathematics, during, this, period, he, also, made, his, first, attempts, at, research, trying, to, solve, the, quintic, equation, by, radicals, in, 1821, jacobi, went, to, study, at, berlin, university, where, he, initially, divided, his, attention, between, his, passions, for, philology, and, mathematics, in, philology, he, participated, in, the, seminars, of, b, ckh, drawing, the, professor, s, attention, with, his, talent, jacobi, did, not, follow, a, lot, of, mathematics, classes, at, the, time, finding, the, level, of, mathematics, taught, at, berlin, university, too, elementary, he, continued, instead, with, his, private, study, of, the, more, advanced, works, of, euler, lagrange, and, laplace, by, 1823, he, understood, that, he, needed, to, make, a, decision, between, his, competing, interests, and, chose, to, devote, all, his, attention, to, mathematics, in, the, same, year, he, became, qualified, to, teach, secondary, school, and, was, offered, a, position, at, the, joachimsthal, gymnasium, in, berlin, jacobi, decided, instead, to, continue, to, work, towards, a, university, position, in, 1825, he, obtained, the, degree, of, doctor, of, philosophy, with, a, dissertation, on, the, partial, fraction, decomposition, of, rational, fractions, defended, before, a, commission, led, by, enno, dirksen, he, followed, immediately, with, his, habilitation, and, at, the, same, time, converted, to, christianity, now, qualifying, for, teaching, university, classes, the, 21, year, old, jacobi, lectured, in, 1825, 26, on, the, theory, of, curves, and, surfaces, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1826, jacobi, became, a, private, lecturer, in, the, next, year, an, extraodinary, professor, and, in, finally, 1829, a, tenured, professor, of, mathematics, at, k, nigsberg, university, and, held, the, chair, until, 1842, he, suffered, a, breakdown, from, overwork, in, 1843, he, then, visited, italy, for, a, few, months, to, regain, his, health, on, his, return, he, moved, to, berlin, where, he, lived, as, a, royal, pensioner, apart, from, a, very, brief, interim, until, his, death, during, the, revolution, of, 1848, jacobi, was, politically, involved, and, unsuccessfully, presented, his, parliamentary, candidature, on, behalf, of, a, liberal, club, this, led, after, the, suppression, of, the, revolution, to, his, royal, grant, being, cut, off, but, his, fame, and, reputation, were, such, that, it, was, soon, resumed, thanks, to, the, personal, intervention, of, alexander, von, humboldt, jacobi, died, in, 1851, from, a, smallpox, infection, his, grave, is, preserved, at, a, cemetery, in, the, kreuzberg, section, of, berlin, the, friedhof, i, der, dreifaltigkeits, kirchengemeinde, 61, baruther, street, his, grave, is, close, to, that, of, johann, encke, the, astronomer, the, crater, jacobi, on, the, moon, is, named, after, him, one, of, jacobi, s, greatest, accomplishments, was, his, theory, of, elliptic, functions, and, their, relation, to, the, elliptic, theta, function, this, was, developed, in, his, great, treatise, fundamenta, nova, theoriae, functionum, ellipticarum, 1829, and, in, later, papers, in, crelle, s, journal, theta, functions, are, of, great, importance, in, mathematical, physics, because, of, their, role, in, the, inverse, problem, for, periodic, and, quasi, periodic, flows, the, equations, of, motion, are, integrable, in, terms, of, jacobi, s, elliptic, functions, in, the, well, known, cases, of, the, pendulum, the, euler, top, the, symmetric, lagrange, top, in, a, gravitational, field, and, the, kepler, problem, planetary, motion, in, a, central, gravitational, field, he, also, made, fundamental, contributions, in, the, study, of, differential, equations, and, to, classical, mechanics, notably, the, hamilton, jacobi, theory, it, was, in, algebraic, development, that, jacobi, s, particular, power, mainly, lay, and, he, made, important, contributions, of, this, kind, in, many, areas, of, mathematics, as, shown, by, his, long, list, of, papers, in, crelle, s, journal, and, elsewhere, from, 1826, onwards, he, is, said, to, have, told, his, students, that, when, looking, for, a, research, topic, one, should, invert, always, invert, german, original, man, muss, immer, umkehren, reflecting, his, belief, that, inverting, known, results, can, open, up, new, fields, for, research, for, example, inverting, elliptic, integrals, and, focusing, on, the, nature, of, elliptic, and, theta, functions, in, his, 1835, paper, jacobi, proved, the, following, basic, result, classifying, periodic, including, elliptic, functions, if, a, univariate, single, valued, function, is, multiply, periodic, then, such, a, function, cannot, have, more, than, two, periods, and, the, ratio, of, the, periods, cannot, be, a, real, number, he, discovered, many, of, the, fundamental, properties, of, theta, functions, including, the, functional, equation, and, the, jacobi, triple, product, formula, as, well, as, many, other, results, on, q, series, and, hypergeometric, series, the, solution, of, the, jacobi, inversion, problem, for, the, hyperelliptic, abel, map, by, weierstrass, in, 1854, required, the, introduction, of, the, hyperelliptic, theta, function, and, later, the, general, riemann, theta, function, for, algebraic, curves, of, arbitrary, genus, the, complex, torus, associated, to, a, genus, g, displaystyle, g, algebraic, curve, obtained, by, quotienting, c, g, displaystyle, mathbf, c, g, by, the, lattice, of, periods, is, referred, to, as, the, jacobian, variety, this, method, of, inversion, and, its, subsequent, extension, by, weierstrass, and, riemann, to, arbitrary, algebraic, curves, may, be, seen, as, a, higher, genus, generalization, of, the, relation, between, elliptic, integrals, and, the, jacobi, or, weierstrass, elliptic, functions, jacobi, was, the, first, to, apply, elliptic, functions, to, number, theory, for, example, proving, fermat, s, two, square, theorem, and, lagrange, s, four, square, theorem, and, similar, results, for, 6, and, 8, squares, his, other, work, in, number, theory, continued, the, work, of, gauss, new, proofs, of, quadratic, reciprocity, and, the, introduction, of, the, jacobi, symbol, contributions, to, higher, reciprocity, laws, investigations, of, continued, fractions, and, the, invention, of, jacobi, sums, he, was, also, one, of, the, early, founders, of, the, theory, of, determinants, in, particular, he, invented, the, jacobian, determinant, formed, from, the, n, 2, partial, derivatives, of, n, given, functions, of, n, independent, variables, which, plays, an, important, part, in, changes, of, variables, in, multiple, integrals, and, in, many, analytical, investigations, in, 1841, he, reintroduced, the, partial, derivative, notation, of, legendre, which, was, to, become, standard, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, introduce, and, study, the, symmetric, polynomials, that, are, now, known, as, schur, polynomials, giving, the, so, called, bialternant, formula, for, these, which, is, a, special, case, of, the, weyl, character, formula, and, deriving, the, jacobi, trudi, identities, he, also, discovered, the, desnanot, jacobi, formula, for, determinants, which, underlie, the, pl, cker, relations, for, grassmannians, students, of, vector, fields, lie, theory, hamiltonian, mechanics, and, operator, algebras, often, encounter, the, jacobi, identity, the, analog, of, associativity, for, the, lie, bracket, operation, planetary, theory, and, other, particular, dynamical, problems, likewise, occupied, his, attention, from, time, to, time, while, contributing, to, celestial, mechanics, he, introduced, the, jacobi, integral, 1836, for, a, sidereal, coordinate, system, his, theory, of, the, last, multiplier, is, treated, in, vorlesungen, ber, dynamik, edited, by, alfred, clebsch, 1866, he, left, many, manuscripts, portions, of, which, have, been, published, at, intervals, in, crelle, s, journal, his, other, works, include, commentatio, de, transformatione, integralis, duplicis, indefiniti, in, formam, simpliciorem, 1832, canon, arithmeticus, 1839, and, opuscula, mathematica, 1846, 1857, his, gesammelte, werke, 1881, 1891, were, published, by, the, berlin, academy
