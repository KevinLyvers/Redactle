changed, the, sweet, dance, band, sound, of, the, group, to, one, that, was, hotter, which, contemporaries, termed, jungle, style, which, can, be, seen, in, his, feature, chorus, in, east, st, louis, toodle, oo, 1926, in, october, 1927, ellington, and, his, orchestra, recorded, several, compositions, with, adelaide, hall, one, side, in, particular, creole, love, call, became, a, worldwide,

duke, ellington, barry, ulanov, wrote, from, vodery, as, he, ellington, says, himself, he, drew, his, chromatic, convictions, his, uses, of, the, tones, ordinarily, extraneous, to, the, diatonic, scale, with, the, consequent, alteration, of, the, harmonic, character, of, his, music, it, s, broadening, the, deepening, of, his, resources, it, has, become, customary, to, ascribe, the, classical, influences, upon, duke, delius, debussy, and, ravel, to, direct, contact, with, their, music, actually, his, serious, appreciation, of, those, and, other, modern, composers, came, after, he, met,

conducting, from, the, keyboard, using, piano, cues, and, visual, gestures, very, rarely, did, he, conduct, using, a, baton, by, 1932, his, orchestra, consisted, of, six, brass, instruments, four, reeds, and, a, rhythm, section, of, four, players, as, the, leader, ellington, was, not, a, strict, disciplinarian, he, maintained, control, of, his, orchestra, with, a, combination, of, charm, humor, flattery, and, astute, psychology, a, complex, private, person, he, revealed, his, feelings, to, only, his, closest, intimates, he, effectively, used, his, public, persona, to, deflect, attention, away, from, himself, ellington, signed, exclusively, to, brunswick, in, 1932, and, stayed, with, them, through, to, late, 1936, albeit, with, a, short, lived, 1933, 34, switch, to, victor, when, irving, mills, temporarily, moved, his, acts, from, brunswick, as, the, depression, worsened, the, recording, industry, was, in, crisis, dropping, over, 90, of, its, artists, by, 1933, ivie, anderson,

lasted, until, june, 24, the, british, visit, saw, ellington, win, praise, from, members, of, the, serious, music, community, including, composer, constant, lambert, which, gave, a, boost, to, ellington, s, interest, in, composing, longer, works, his, longer, pieces, had, already, begun, to, appear, ellington, had, composed, and, recorded, creole, rhapsody, as, early, as, 1931, issued, as,

agent, mills, the, attention, was, a, publicity, triumph, as, ellington, was, now, internationally, known, on, the, band, s, tour, through, the, segregated, south, in, 1934, they, avoided, some, of, the, traveling, difficulties, of, african, americans, by, touring, in, private, railcars, these, provided, accessible, accommodations, dining, and, storage, for, equipment, while, avoiding, the, indignities, of, segregated, facilities, however, the, competition, intensified, as, swing, bands, like, benny, goodman, s, began, to, receive, widespread, attention, swing, dancing, became, a, youth, phenomenon, particularly, with, white, college, audiences, and, danceability, drove, record, sales, and, bookings, jukeboxes, proliferated, nationwide, spreading, the, gospel, of, swing, ellington, s, band, could, certainly, swing, but, their, strengths, were, mood, nuance, and, richness, of, composition, hence, his, statement, jazz, is, music, the, swing, is, business, from, 1936, ellington, began, to, make, recordings, with, smaller, groups, sextets, octets, and, nonets, drawn, from, his, then, 15, man, orchestra, he, composed, pieces, intended, to, feature, a, specific, instrumentalist, such, as, jeep, s, blues, for, johnny, hodges, yearning, for, love, for, lawrence, brown, trumpet, in, spades, for, rex, stewart, echoes, of, harlem, for, cootie, williams, and, clarinet, lament, for,

many, expenses, ellington, s, finances, were, tight, however, his, situation, improved, in, the, following, years, after, leaving, agent, irving, mills, he, signed, on, with, the, william, morris, agency, mills, though, continued, to, record, ellington, after, only, a, year, his, master, and, variety, labels, the, small, groups, had, recorded, for, the, latter, collapsed, in, late, 1937, mills, placed, ellington, back, on, brunswick, and, those, small, group, units, on, vocalion, through, to, 1940, well, known, sides, continued, to, be, recorded, caravan, in, 1937, and, i, let, a, song, go, out, of, my, heart, the, following, year, billy, strayhorn, originally, hired, as, a, lyricist, began, his, association, with, ellington, in, 1939, nicknamed, sweet, pea, for, his, mild, manner, strayhorn, soon, became, a, vital, member, of, the, ellington, organization, ellington, showed, great, fondness, for, strayhorn, and, never, failed, to, speak, glowingly, of, the, man, and, their, collaborative, working, relationship, my, right, arm, my, left, arm, all, the, eyes, in, the, back, of, my, head, my, brain, waves, in, his, head, and, his, in, mine, strayhorn, with, his, training, in, classical, music, not, only, contributed, his, original, lyrics, and, music, but, also, arranged, and, polished, many, of, ellington, s, works, becoming, a, second, ellington, or, duke, s, doppelg, nger, it, was, not, uncommon, for, strayhorn, to, fill, in, for, duke, whether, in, conducting, or, rehearsing, the, band, playing, the, piano, on, stage, and, in, the, recording, studio, the, decade, ended, with, a, very, successful, european, tour, in, 1939, just, as, world, war, ii, loomed, in, europe, two, musicians, who, joined, ellington, at, this, time, created, a, sensation, in, their, own, right, jimmy, blanton, and, ben, webster, blanton, was, effectively, hired, on, the, spot, in, late, october, 1939, before, ellington, was, aware, of, his, name, when, he, dropped, in, on, a, gig, of, fate, marable, in, st, louis, the, short, lived, blanton, transformed, the, use, of, double, bass, in, jazz, allowing, it, to, function, as, a, solo, melodic, instrument, rather, than, a, rhythm, instrument, alone, terminal, illness, forced, him, to, leave, by, late, 1941, after, around, two, years, ben, webster, s, principal, tenure, with, ellington, spanned, 1939, to, 1943, an,

first, regular, tenor, saxophonist, and, increased, the, size, of, the, sax, section, to, five, for, the, first, time, much, influenced, by, johnny, hodges, he, often, credited, hodges, with, showing, him, how, to, play, my, horn, the, two, men, sat, next, to, each, other, in, the, orchestra, trumpeter, ray, nance, joined, replacing, cootie, williams, who, had, defected, to, benny, goodman,

earliest, of, innumerable, live, performances, which, survive, nance, was, an, occasional, vocalist, as, well, although, herb, jeffries, was, the, main, male, vocalist, in, this, era, until, 1943, while, al, hibbler, who, replaced, jeffries, in, 1943, continued, until, 1951, ivie, anderson, left, in, 1942, for, health, reasons, after, 11, years, the, longest, term, of, any, of, ellington, s,

orchestra, of, distinctive, voices, displaying, tremendous, creativity, the, commercial, recordings, from, this, era, were, re, issued, in, the, three, cd, collection, never, no, lament, in, 2003, ellington, s, long, term, aim, though, was, to, extend, the, jazz, form, from, that, three, minute, limit, of, which, he, was, an, acknowledged, master, while, he, had, composed, and, recorded, some, extended, pieces, before, such, works, now, became, a, regular, feature, of, ellington, s, output, in, this, he, was, helped, by, strayhorn, who, had, enjoyed, a, more, thorough, training, in, the, forms, associated, with, classical, music, than, ellington, the, first, of, these, black, brown, and, beige, 1943, was, dedicated, to, telling, the, story, of, african, americans, and, the, place, of, slavery, and, the, church, in, their, history, black, brown, and, beige, debuted, at, carnegie, hall, on, january, 23, 1943, beginning, an, annual, series, of, ellington, concerts, at, the, venue, over, the, next, four, years, while, some, jazz, musicians, had, played, at, carnegie, hall, before, none, had, performed, anything, as, elaborate, as, ellington, s, work, unfortunately, starting, a, regular, pattern, ellington, s, longer, works, were, generally, not, well, received, a, partial, exception, was, jump, for, joy, a, full, length, musical, based, on, themes, of, african, american, identity, which, debuted, on, july, 10, 1941, at, the, mayan, theater, in, los, angeles, hollywood, actors, john, garfield, and, mickey, rooney, invested, in, the, production, and, charlie, chaplin, and, orson, welles, offered, to, direct, at, one, performance, garfield, insisted, that, herb, jeffries, who, was, light, skinned, should, wear, makeup, ellington, objected, in, the, interval, and, compared, jeffries, to, al, jolson, the, change, was, reverted, the, singer, later, commented, that, the, audience, must, have, thought, he, was, an, entirely, different, character, in, the, second, half, of, the, show, although, it, had, sold, out, performances, and, received, positive, reviews, it, ran, for, only, 122, performances, until, september, 29, 1941, with, a, brief, revival, in, november, of, that, year, its, subject, matter, did, not, make, it, appealing, to, broadway, ellington, had, unfulfilled, plans, to, take, it, there, despite, this, disappointment, a, broadway, production, of, ellington, s, beggar, s, holiday, his, sole, book, musical, premiered, on, december, 23, 1946, under, the, direction, of, nicholas, ray, the, settlement, of, the, first, recording, ban, of, 1942, 44, leading, to, an, increase, in, royalties, paid, to, musicians, had, a, severe, effect, on, the, financial, viability, of, the, big, bands, including, ellington, s, orchestra, his, income, as, a, songwriter, ultimately, subsidized, it, although, he, always, spent, lavishly, and, drew, a, respectable, income, from, the, orchestra, s, operations, the, band, s, income, often, just, covered, expenses, however, in, 1943, ellington, asked, webster, to, leave, the, saxophonist, s, personality, made, his, colleagues, anxious, and, the, saxophonist, was, regularly, in, conflict, with, the, leader, musicians, enlisting, in, the, military, and, travel, restrictions, made, touring, difficult, for, the, big, bands, and, dancing, became, subject, to, a, new, tax, which, continued, for, many, years, affecting, the, choices, of, club, owners, by, the, time, world, war, ii, ended, the, focus, of, popular, music, was, shifting, towards, singing, crooners, such, as, frank, sinatra, and, jo, stafford, as, the, cost, of, hiring, big, bands, had, increased, club, owners, now, found, smaller, jazz, groups, more, cost, effective, some, of, ellington, s, new, works, such, as, the, wordless, vocal, feature, transblucency, 1946, with, kay, davis, were, not, going, to, have, a, similar, reach, as, the, newly, emerging, stars, ellington, continued, on, his, own, course, through, these, tectonic, shifts, while, count, basie, was, forced, to, disband, his, whole, ensemble, and, work, as, an, octet, for, a, time, ellington, was, able, to, tour, most, of, western, europe, between, april, 6, and, june, 30, 1950, with, the, orchestra, playing, 74, dates, over, 77, days, during, the, tour, according, to, sonny, greer, ellington, did, not, perform, the, newer, works, however, ellington, s, extended, composition, harlem, 1950, was, in, the, process, of, being, completed, at, this, time, ellington, later, presented, its, score, to, music, loving, president, harry, truman, also, during, his, time, in, europe, ellington, would, compose, the, music, for, a, stage, production, by, orson, welles, titled, time, runs, in, paris, and, an, evening, with, orson, welles, in, frankfurt, the, variety, show, also, featured, a, newly, discovered, eartha, kitt, who, performed, ellington, s, original, song, hungry, little, trouble, as, helen, of, troy, in, 1951, ellington, suffered, a, significant, loss, of, personnel, sonny, greer, lawrence, brown, and, most, importantly, johnny, hodges, left, to, pursue, other, ventures, however, only, greer, was, a, permanent, departee, drummer, louie, bellson, replaced, greer, and, his, skin, deep, was, a, hit, for, ellington, tenor, player, paul, gonsalves, had, joined, in, december, 1950, after, periods, with, count, basie, and, dizzy, gillespie, and, stayed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, while, clark, terry, joined, in, november, 1951, andr, previn, said, in, 1952, you, know, stan, kenton, can, stand, in, front, of, a, thousand, fiddles, and, a, thousand, brass, and, make, a, dramatic, gesture, and, every, studio, arranger, can, nod, his, head, and, say, oh, yes, that, s, done, like, this, but, duke, merely, lifts, his, finger, three, horns, make, a, sound, and, i, don, t, know, what, it, is, however, by, 1955, after, three, years, of, recording, for, capitol, ellington, lacked, a, regular, recording, affiliation, ellington, s, appearance, at, the, newport, jazz, festival, on, july, 7, 1956, returned, him, to, wider, prominence, the, feature, diminuendo, and, crescendo, in, blue, comprised, two, tunes, that, had, been, in, the, band, s, book, since, 1937, ellington, who, had, abruptly, ended, the, band, s, scheduled, set, because, of, the, late, arrival, of, four, key, players, called, the, two, tunes, as, the, time, was, approaching, midnight, announcing, that, the, two, pieces, would, be, separated, by, an, interlude, played, by, tenor, saxophonist, paul, gonsalves, ellington, proceeded, to, lead, the, band, through, the, two, pieces, with, gonsalves, 27, chorus, marathon, solo, whipping, the, crowd, into, a, frenzy, leading, the, maestro, to, play, way, beyond, the, curfew, time, despite, urgent, pleas, from, festival, organizer, george, wein, to, bring, the, program, to, an, end, the, concert, made, international, headlines, and, led, to, one, of, only, five, time, magazine, cover, stories, dedicated, to, a, jazz, musician, and, resulted, in, an, album, produced, by, george, avakian, that, would, become, the, best, selling, lp, of, ellington, s, career, much, of, the, music, on, the, lp, was, in, effect, simulated, with, only, about, 40, actually, from, the, concert, itself, according, to, avakian, ellington, was, dissatisfied, with, aspects, of, the, performance, and, felt, the, musicians, had, been, under, rehearsed, the, band, assembled, the, next, day, to, re, record, several, numbers, with, the, addition, of, the, faked, sound, of, a, crowd, none, of, which, was, disclosed, to, purchasers, of, the, album, not, until, 1999, was, the, concert, recording, properly, released, for, the, first, time, the, revived, attention, brought, about, by, the, newport, appearance, should, not, have, surprised, anyone, johnny, hodges, had, returned, the, previous, year, and, ellington, s, collaboration, with, strayhorn, was, renewed, around, the, same, time, under, terms, more, amenable, to, the, younger, man, the, original, ellington, at, newport, album, was, the, first, release, in, a, new, recording, contract, with, columbia, records, which, yielded, several, years, of, recording, stability, mainly, under, producer, irving, townsend, who, coaxed, both, commercial, and, artistic, productions, from, ellington, in, 1957, cbs, columbia, records, parent, corporation, aired, a, live, television, production, of, a, drum, is, a, woman, an, allegorical, suite, which, received, mixed, reviews, festival, appearances, at, the, new, monterey, jazz, festival, and, elsewhere, provided, venues, for, live, exposure, and, a, european, tour, in, 1958, was, well, received, such, sweet, thunder, 1957, based, on, shakespeare, s, plays, and, characters, and, the, queen, s, suite, 1958, dedicated, to, britain, s, queen, elizabeth, ii, were, products, of, the, renewed, impetus, which, the, newport, appearance, helped, to, create, however, the, latter, work, was, not, commercially, issued, at, the, time, the, late, 1950s, also, saw, ella, fitzgerald, record, her, duke, ellington, songbook, verve, with, ellington, and, his, orchestra, a, recognition, that, ellington, s, songs, had, now, become, part, of, the, cultural, canon, known, as, the, great, american, songbook, around, this, time, ellington, and, strayhorn, began, to, work, on, film, scoring, the, first, of, these, was, anatomy, of, a, murder, 1959, a, courtroom, drama, directed, by, otto, preminger, and, featuring, james, stewart, in, which, ellington, appeared, fronting, a, roadhouse, combo, film, historians, have, recognized, the, score, as, a, landmark, the, first, significant, hollywood, film, music, by, african, americans, comprising, non, diegetic, music, that, is, music, whose, source, is, not, visible, or, implied, by, action, in, the, film, like, an, on, screen, band, the, score, avoided, the, cultural, stereotypes, which, previously, characterized, jazz, scores, and, rejected, a, strict, adherence, to, visuals, in, ways, that, presaged, the, new, wave, cinema, of, the, 60s, ellington, and, strayhorn, always, looking, for, new, musical, territory, produced, suites, for, john, steinbeck, s, novel, sweet, thursday, tchaikovsky, s, nutcracker, suite, and, edvard, grieg, s, peer, gynt, anatomy, of, a, murder, was, followed, by, paris, blues, 1961, which, featured, paul, newman, and, sidney, poitier, as, jazz, musicians, for, this, work, ellington, was, nominated, for, the, academy, award, for, best, score, in, the, early, 1960s, ellington, embraced, recording, with, artists, who, had, been, friendly, rivals, in, the, past, or, were, younger, musicians, who, focused, on, later, styles, the, ellington, and, count, basie, orchestras, recorded, together, with, the, album, first, time, the, count, meets, the, duke, 1961, during, a, period, when, ellington, was, between, recording, contracts, he, made,

jungle, united, artists, album, he, signed, to, frank, sinatra, s, new, reprise, label, but, the, association, with, the, label, was, short, lived, musicians, who, had, previously, worked, with, ellington, returned, to, the, orchestra, as, members, lawrence, brown, in, 1960, and, cootie, williams, in, 1962, the, writing, and, playing, of, music, is, a, matter, of, intent, you, can, t, just, throw, a, paintbrush, against, the, wall, and, call, whatever, happens, art, my, music, fits, the, tonal, personality, of, the, player, i, think, too, strongly, in, terms, of, altering, my, music, to, fit, the, performer, to, be, impressed, by, accidental, music, you, can, t, take, doodling, seriously, he, was, now, performing, worldwide, and, spent, a, significant, part, of, each, year, on, overseas, tours, as, a, consequence, he, formed, new, working, relationships, with, artists, from, around, the, world, including, the, swedish, vocalist, alice, babs, and, the, south, african,

timon, of, athens, at, the, stratford, festival, in, ontario, canada, which, opened, on, july, 29, 1963, langham, has, used, it, for, several, subsequent, productions, including, a, much, later, adaptation, by, stanley, silverman, which, expands, the, score, with, some, of, ellington, s, best, known, works, ellington, was, shortlisted, for, the, pulitzer, prize, for, music, in, 1965, however,

awarded, a, special, pulitzer, prize, commemorating, the, centennial, year, of, his, birth, in, recognition, of, his, musical, genius, which, evoked, aesthetically, the, principles, of, democracy, through, the, medium, of, jazz, and, thus, made, an, indelible, contribution, to, art, and, culture, in, september, 1965, he, premiered, the, first, of, his, sacred, concerts, he, created, a, jazz, christian, liturgy, although, the, work, received, mixed, reviews, ellington, was, proud, of, the, composition, and, performed, it, dozens, of, times, this, concert, was, followed, by, two, others, of, the, same, type, in, 1968, and, 1973, known, as, the, second, and, third, sacred, concerts, many, saw, the, sacred, music, suites, as, an, attempt, to, reinforce, commercial, support, for, organized, religion, however, ellington, simply, said, it, was, the, most, important, thing, i, ve, done, the, steinway, piano, upon, which, the, sacred, concerts, were, composed, is, part, of, the, collection, of, the, smithsonian, s, national, museum, of, american, history, like, haydn, and, mozart, ellington, conducted, his, orchestra, from, the, piano, he, always, played, the, keyboard, parts, when, the, sacred, concerts, were, performed, duke, turned, 65, in, the, spring, of, 1964, but, showed, no, signs, of, slowing, down, as, he, continued, to, make, recordings, of, significant,
