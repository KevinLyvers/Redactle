amerigo, vespucci, v, s, p, u, t, i, ve, spoo, chee, italian, 9, march, 1454, 22, february, 1512, was, an, italian, explorer, and, navigator, from, the, republic, of, florence, from, whose, name, the, term, america, is, derived, between, 1497, and, 1504, vespucci, participated, in, at, least, two, voyages, of, the, age, of, discovery, first, on, behalf, of, spain, 1499, 1500, and, then, for, portugal, 1501, 1502, in, 1503, and, 1505, two, booklets, were, published, under, his, name, containing, colourful, descriptions, of, these, explorations, and, other, alleged, voyages, both, publications, were, extremely, popular, and, widely, read, across, much, of, europe, although, historians, still, dispute, the, authorship, and, veracity, of, these, accounts, at, the, time, they, were, instrumental, in, raising, awareness, of, the, new, discoveries, and, enhancing, the, reputation, of, vespucci, as, an, explorer, and, navigator, vespucci, claimed, to, have, understood, back, in, 1501, during, his, portuguese, expedition, that, brazil, was, part, of, a, fourth, continent, unknown, to, europeans, which, he, called, the, new, world, the, claim, inspired, cartographer, martin, waldseem, ller, to, recognize, vespucci, s, accomplishments, in, 1507, by, applying, the, latinized, form, america, for, the, first, time, to, a, map, showing, the, new, world, other, cartographers, followed, suit, and, by, 1538, the, tradition, of, marking, the, name, america, on, maps, of, the, newly, discovered, continents, was, secure, it, is, unknown, whether, vespucci, was, ever, aware, of, these, honours, in, 1505, he, was, made, a, subject, of, castile, by, royal, decree, and, in, 1508, he, was, appointed, to, the, newly, created, position, of, piloto, mayor, master, navigator, for, spain, s, casa, de, contrataci, n, house, of, trade, in, seville, a, post, he, held, until, his, death, in, 1512, vespucci, was, born, on, 9, march, 1454, in, florence, a, wealthy, italian, city, state, and, a, center, of, renaissance, art, and, learning, in, the, suburb, of, peretola, amerigo, vespucci, was, the, third, son, of, nastagio, vespucci, a, florentine, notary, for, the, money, changers, guild, and, lisa, di, giovanni, mini, the, family, resided, in, the, district, of, santa, lucia, d, ognissanti, along, with, other, families, of, the, vespucci, clan, earlier, generations, of, vespucci, had, funded, a, family, chapel, in, the, ognissanti, church, and, the, nearby, hospital, of, san, giovanni, di, dio, was, founded, by, simone, di, piero, vespucci, in, 1380, vespucci, s, immediate, family, was, not, especially, prosperous, but, they, were, politically, well, connected, amerigo, s, grandfather, also, named, amerigo, vespucci, served, a, total, of, 36, years, as, the, chancellor, of, the, florentine, government, known, as, the, signoria, and, nastagio, also, served, in, the, signoria, and, in, other, guild, offices, more, importantly, the, vespuccis, had, good, relations, with, lorenzo, de, medici, the, powerful, de, facto, ruler, of, florence, amerigo, s, two, older, brothers, antonio, and, girolamo, were, sent, to, the, university, of, pisa, for, their, education, antonio, followed, his, father, to, become, a, notary, while, girolamo, entered, the, church, and, joined, the, knights, hospitaller, in, rhodes, amerigo, s, career, path, seemed, less, certain, instead, of, following, his, brothers, to, the, university, he, remained, in, florence, and, was, tutored, by, his, uncle, giorgio, antonio, vespucci, a, dominican, friar, in, the, monastery, of, san, marco, fortunately, for, amerigo, his, uncle, was, one, of, the, most, celebrated, humanist, scholars, in, florence, at, the, time, and, provided, him, with, a, broad, education, in, literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and, latin, he, was, also, introduced, to, geography, and, astronomy, subjects, that, played, an, essential, part, in, his, career, amerigo, s, later, writings, demonstrated, a, familiarity, with, the, work, of, the, classic, greek, cosmographers, ptolemy, and, strabo, and, the, more, recent, work, of, florentine, astronomer, paolo, dal, pozzo, toscanelli, in, 1478, guido, antonio, vespucci, amerigo, s, other, uncle, led, a, florentine, diplomatic, mission, to, paris, and, invited, his, younger, cousin, amerigo, vespucci, to, join, him, amerigo, s, role, is, not, clear, but, it, was, likely, as, an, attache, or, private, secretary, along, the, way, they, had, business, in, bologna, milan, and, lyon, their, objective, in, paris, was, to, obtain, french, support, for, florence, s, war, with, naples, louis, xi, was, noncommittal, and, the, diplomatic, mission, returned, to, florence, in, 1481, with, little, to, show, for, their, efforts, after, his, return, from, paris, amerigo, worked, for, a, time, with, his, father, and, continued, his, studies, in, science, in, 1482, when, his, father, died, amerigo, went, to, work, for, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, de, medici, head, of, a, junior, branch, of, the, medici, family, although, amerigo, was, twelve, years, older, they, had, been, schoolmates, under, the, tutelage, of, giorgio, antonio, vespucci, amerigo, served, first, as, a, household, manager, and, then, gradually, took, on, increasing, responsibilities, handling, various, business, dealings, for, the, family, both, at, home, and, abroad, meanwhile, he, continued, to, show, an, interest, in, geography, at, one, point, buying, an, expensive, map, made, by, the, master, cartographer, gabriel, de, vallseca, in, 1488, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, became, dissatisfied, with, his, seville, business, agent, tomasso, capponi, he, dispatched, vespucci, to, investigate, the, situation, and, provide, an, assessment, of, a, suggested, replacement, florentine, merchant, gianotto, berardi, vespucci, s, findings, have, been, lost, but, capponi, returned, to, florence, around, this, time, and, berardi, took, over, the, medici, business, in, seville, in, addition, to, managing, medici, s, trade, in, seville, berardi, had, his, own, business, in, african, slavery, and, ship, chandlery, by, 1492, vespucci, had, settled, permanently, in, seville, his, motivations, for, leaving, florence, are, unclear, he, continued, to, transact, some, business, on, behalf, of, his, medici, patrons, but, more, and, more, he, became, involved, with, berardi, s, other, activities, most, notably, his, support, of, christopher, columbus, s, voyages, berardi, invested, half, a, million, maravedis, in, columbus, s, first, voyage, and, he, won, a, potentially, lucrative, contract, to, provision, columbus, s, large, second, fleet, however, profits, proved, to, be, elusive, in, 1495, berardi, signed, a, contract, with, the, crown, to, send, 12, resupply, ships, to, hispaniola, but, then, died, unexpectedly, in, december, without, completing, the, terms, of, the, contract, vespucci, was, the, executor, of, berardi, s, will, collecting, debts, and, paying, outstanding, obligations, for, the, firm, afterwards, he, was, left, owing, 140, 000, maravedis, he, continued, to, provision, ships, bound, for, the, west, indies, but, his, opportunities, were, diminishing, columbus, s, expeditions, were, not, providing, the, hoped, for, profits, and, his, patron, lorenzo, di, pierfrancesco, medici, was, using, other, florentine, agents, for, his, business, in, seville, sometime, after, he, settled, in, seville, vespucci, married, a, spanish, woman, maria, cerezo, very, little, is, known, about, her, vespucci, s, will, refers, to, her, as, the, daughter, of, celebrated, military, leader, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, historian, fern, ndez, armesto, speculates, that, she, may, have, been, gonzalo, s, illegitimate, offspring, and, a, connection, that, would, have, been, very, useful, to, vespucci, she, was, an, active, participant, in, his, business, and, held, power, of, attorney, for, vespucci, when, he, was, away, the, evidence, for, vespucci, s, voyages, of, exploration, consists, almost, entirely, of, a, handful, of, letters, written, by, him, or, attributed, to, him, historians, have, differed, sharply, on, the, authorship, accuracy, and, veracity, of, these, documents, consequently, opinions, also, vary, widely, regarding, the, number, of, voyages, undertaken, their, routes, and, vespucci, s, roles, and, accomplishments, starting, in, the, late, 1490s, vespucci, participated, in, two, voyages, to, the, new, world, that, are, relatively, well, documented, in, the, historical, record, two, others, have, been, alleged, but, the, evidence, is, more, problematic, traditionally, vespucci, s, voyages, are, referred, to, as, the, first, through, fourth, even, by, historians, who, dismiss, one, or, more, of, the, trips, a, letter, addressed, to, florentine, official, piero, soderini, dated, 1504, and, published, the, following, year, purports, to, be, an, account, by, vespucci, of, a, voyage, to, the, new, world, departing, from, spain, on, 10, may, 1497, and, returning, on, 15, october, 1498, this, is, perhaps, the, most, controversial, of, vespucci, s, voyages, as, this, letter, is, the, only, known, record, of, its, occurrence, and, many, historians, doubt, that, it, took, place, as, described, some, question, the, authorship, and, accuracy, of, the, letter, and, consider, it, to, be, a, forgery, others, point, to, the, inconsistencies, in, the, narrative, of, the, voyage, particularly, the, alleged, course, starting, near, honduras, and, proceeding, northwest, for, 870, leagues, about, 5, 130, km, or, 3, 190, mi, a, course, that, would, have, taken, them, across, mexico, to, the, pacific, ocean, certain, earlier, historians, including, contemporary, bartolom, de, las, casas, suspected, that, vespucci, incorporated, observations, from, a, later, voyage, into, a, fictitious, account, of, this, supposed, first, one, so, as, to, gain, primacy, over, columbus, and, position, himself, as, the, first, european, explorer, to, encounter, the, mainland, others, including, scholar, alberto, magnaghi, have, suggested, that, the, soderini, letter, was, not, written, by, vespucci, at, all, but, rather, by, an, unknown, author, who, had, access, to, the, navigator, s, private, letters, to, lorenzo, de, medici, about, his, 1499, and, 1501, expeditions, to, the, americas, which, make, no, mention, of, a, 1497, voyage, the, soderini, letter, is, one, of, two, attributed, to, vespucci, that, were, edited, and, widely, circulated, during, his, lifetime, in, 1499, vespucci, joined, an, expedition, licensed, by, spain, and, led, by, alonso, de, ojeda, as, fleet, commander, and, juan, de, la, cosa, as, chief, navigator, their, intention, was, to, explore, the, coast, of, a, new, landmass, found, by, columbus, on, his, third, voyage, and, in, particular, investigate, a, rich, source, of, pearls, that, columbus, had, reported, vespucci, and, his, backers, financed, two, of, the, four, ships, in, the, small, fleet, his, role, on, the, voyage, is, not, clear, writing, later, about, his, experience, vespucci, gave, the, impression, that, he, had, a, leadership, role, but, that, is, unlikely, due, to, his, inexperience, instead, he, may, have, served, as, a, commercial, representative, on, behalf, of, the, fleet, s, investors, years, later, ojeda, recalled, that, morigo, vespuche, was, one, of, his, pilots, on, the, expedition, the, vessels, left, spain, on, 18, may, 1499, and, stopped, first, in, the, canary, islands, before, reaching, south, america, somewhere, near, present, day, suriname, or, french, guiana, from, there, the, fleet, split, up, ojeda, proceeded, northwest, toward, modern, venezuela, with, two, ships, while, the, other, pair, headed, south, with, vespucci, aboard, the, only, record, of, the, southbound, journey, comes, from, vespucci, himself, he, assumed, they, were, on, the, coast, of, asia, and, hoped, by, heading, south, they, would, according, to, the, greek, geographer, ptolemy, round, the, unidentified, cape, of, cattigara, and, reach, the, indian, ocean, they, passed, two, huge, rivers, the, amazon, and, the, para, which, poured, freshwater, 25, miles, 40, km, out, to, sea, they, continued, south, for, another, 40, leagues, about, 240, km, or, 150, mi, before, encountering, a, very, strong, adverse, current, which, they, could, not, overcome, forced, to, turn, around, the, ships, headed, north, retracing, their, course, to, the, original, landfall, from, there, vespucci, continued, up, the, south, american, coast, to, the, gulf, of, paria, and, along, the, shore, of, what, is, now, venezuela, at, some, point, they, may, have, rejoined, ojeda, but, the, evidence, is, unclear, in, the, late, summer, they, decided, to, head, north, for, the, spanish, colony, at, hispaniola, in, the, west, indies, to, resupply, and, repair, their, ships, before, heading, home, after, hispaniola, they, made, a, brief, slave, raid, in, the, bahamas, capturing, 232, natives, and, then, returned, to, spain, in, 1501, manuel, i, of, portugal, commissioned, an, expedition, to, investigate, a, landmass, far, to, the, west, in, the, atlantic, ocean, encountered, unexpectedly, by, a, wayward, pedro, lvares, cabral, on, his, voyage, around, africa, to, india, that, land, would, eventually, become, present, day, brazil, the, king, wanted, to, know, the, extent, of, this, new, discovery, and, determine, where, it, lay, in, relation, to, the, line, established, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, any, land, that, lay, to, the, east, of, the, line, could, be, claimed, by, portugal, vespucci, s, reputation, as, an, explorer, and, presumed, navigator, had, already, reached, portugal, and, he, was, hired, by, the, king, to, serve, as, pilot, under, the, command, of, gon, alo, coelho, coelho, s, fleet, of, three, ships, left, lisbon, in, may, 1501, before, crossing, the, atlantic, they, resupplied, at, cape, verde, where, they, encountered, cabral, on, his, way, home, from, his, voyage, to, india, this, was, the, same, expedition, that, had, found, brazil, on, its, outward, bound, journey, the, previous, year, coelho, left, cape, verde, in, june, and, from, this, point, vespucci, s, account, is, the, only, surviving, record, of, their, explorations, on, 17, august, 1501, the, expedition, reached, brazil, at, a, latitude, of, about, 6, south, upon, landing, it, encountered, a, hostile, band, of, natives, who, killed, and, ate, one, of, its, crewmen, sailing, south, along, the, coast, they, found, friendlier, natives, and, were, able, to, engage, in, some, minor, trading, at, 23, s, they, found, a, bay, which, they, named, rio, de, janeiro, because, it, was, 1, january, 1502, on, 13, february, 1502, they, left, the, coast, to, return, home, vespucci, estimated, their, latitude, at, 32, s, but, experts, now, estimate, they, were, closer, to, 25, s, their, homeward, journey, is, unclear, since, vespucci, left, a, confusing, record, of, astronomical, observations, and, distances, travelled, in, 1503, vespucci, may, have, participated, in, a, second, expedition, for, the, portuguese, crown, again, exploring, the, east, coast, of, brazil, there, is, evidence, that, a, voyage, was, led, by, coelho, at, about, this, time, but, no, independent, confirmation, that, vespucci, took, part, the, only, source, for, this, last, voyage, is, the, soderini, letter, but, several, modern, scholars, dispute, vespucci, s, authorship, of, that, letter, and, it, is, uncertain, whether, vespucci, undertook, this, trip, there, are, also, difficulties, with, the, reported, dates, and, details, in, the, account, of, this, voyage, by, early, 1505, vespucci, was, back, in, seville, his, reputation, as, an, explorer, and, navigator, continued, to, grow, and, his, recent, service, in, portugal, did, not, seem, to, damage, his, standing, with, king, ferdinand, on, the, contrary, the, king, was, likely, interested, in, learning, about, the, possibility, of, a, western, passage, to, india, in, february, he, was, summoned, by, the, king, to, consult, on, matters, of, navigation, during, the, next, few, months, he, received, payments, from, the, crown, for, his, services, and, in, april, he, was, declared, by, royal, proclamation, a, citizen, of, castile, and, le, n, from, 1505, until, his, death, in, 1512, vespucci, remained, in, service, to, the, spanish, crown, he, continued, his, work, as, a, chandler, supplying, ships, bound, for, the, indies, he, was, also, hired, to, captain, a, ship, as, part, of, a, fleet, bound, for, the, spice, islands, but, the, planned, voyage, never, took, place, in, march, 1508, he, was, named, chief, pilot, for, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, or, house, of, commerce, which, served, as, a, central, trading, house, for, spain, s, overseas, possessions, he, was, paid, an, annual, salary, of, 50, 000, maravedis, with, an, extra, 25, 000, for, expenses, in, his, new, role, vespucci, was, responsible, for, ensuring, that, ships, pilots, were, adequately, trained, and, licensed, before, sailing, to, the, new, world, he, was, also, charged, with, compiling, a, model, map, based, on, input, from, pilots, who, were, obligated, to, share, what, they, learned, after, each, voyage, vespucci, wrote, his, will, in, april, 1511, he, left, most, of, his, modest, estate, including, five, household, slaves, to, his, wife, his, clothes, books, and, navigational, equipment, were, left, to, his, nephew, giovanni, vespucci, he, requested, to, be, buried, in, a, franciscan, habit, in, his, wife, s, family, tomb, vespucci, died, on, 22, february, 1512, upon, his, death, vespucci, s, wife, was, awarded, an, annual, pension, of, 10, 000, maravedis, to, be, deducted, from, the, salary, of, the, successor, chief, pilot, his, nephew, giovanni, was, hired, into, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, where, he, spent, his, subsequent, years, spying, on, behalf, of, the, florentine, state, a, few, days, ago, i, wrote, you, at, some, length, about, my, return, from, those, new, regions, we, searched, for, and, found, with, the, fleet, at, the, expense, and, by, the, command, of, the, most, serene, king, of, portugal, and, which, can, properly, be, called, a, new, world, since, our, forebears, had, absolutely, no, knowledge, of, it, nor, do, any, of, those, who, are, hearing, about, it, today, on, 7, august, 1501, we, dropped, our, anchor, off, the, shores, of, that, new, land, thanking, god, with, solemn, prayers, and, the, celebration, of, the, mass, once, there, we, determined, that, the, new, land, was, not, an, island, but, a, continent, vespucci, s, voyages, became, widely, known, in, europe, after, two, accounts, attributed, to, him, were, published, between, 1503, and, 1505, the, soderini, letter, 1505, came, to, the, attention, of, a, group, of, humanist, scholars, studying, geography, in, saint, di, a, small, french, town, in, the, duchy, of, lorraine, led, by, walter, lud, the, academy, included, matthias, ringmann, and, martin, waldseem, ller, in, 1506, they, obtained, a, french, translation, of, the, soderini, letter, as, well, as, a, portuguese, maritime, map, that, detailed, the, coast, of, lands, recently, discovered, in, the, western, atlantic, they, surmised, that, this, was, the, new, world, or, the, antipodes, hypothesized, by, classical, writers, the, soderini, letter, gave, vespucci, credit, for, discovery, of, this, new, continent, and, implied, that, the, portuguese, map, was, based, on, his, explorations, in, april, 1507, ringmann, and, waldseem, ller, published, their, introduction, to, cosmography, with, an, accompanying, world, map, the, introduction, was, written, in, latin, and, included, a, latin, translation, of, the, soderini, letter, in, a, preface, to, the, letter, ringmann, wrote, i, see, no, reason, why, anyone, could, properly, disapprove, of, a, name, derived, from, that, of, amerigo, the, discoverer, a, man, of, sagacious, genius, a, suitable, form, would, be, amerige, meaning, land, of, amerigo, or, america, since, europe, and, asia, have, received, women, s, names, a, thousand, copies, of, the, world, map, were, printed, with, the, title, universal, geography, according, to, the, tradition, of, ptolemy, and, the, contributions, of, amerigo, vespucci, and, others, it, was, decorated, with, prominent, portraits, of, ptolemy, and, vespucci, and, for, the, first, time, the, name, america, was, applied, to, a, map, of, the, new, world, the, introduction, and, map, were, a, great, success, and, four, editions, were, printed, in, the, first, year, alone, the, map, was, widely, used, in, universities, and, was, influential, among, cartographers, who, admired, the, craftsmanship, that, went, into, its, creation, in, the, following, years, other, maps, were, printed, that, often, incorporated, the, name, america, in, 1538, gerardus, mercator, used, america, to, name, both, the, north, and, south, continents, on, his, influential, map, by, this, point, the, tradition, of, marking, the, name, america, on, maps, of, the, new, world, was, secure, in, 1513, waldseem, ller, published, a, new, map, with, the, new, world, labelled, terra, incognita, instead, of, america, and, the, accompanying, text, names, columbus, as, discoverer, many, supporters, of, columbus, felt, that, vespucci, had, stolen, an, honour, that, rightfully, belonged, to, columbus, most, historians, now, believe, that, vespucci, was, unaware, of, waldseem, ller, s, map, before, his, death, in, 1512, and, many, assert, that, he, was, not, even, the, author, of, the, soderini, letter, knowledge, of, vespucci, s, voyages, relies, almost, entirely, on, a, handful, of, letters, written, by, him, or, attributed, to, him, two, of, these, letters, were, published, during, his, lifetime, and, received, widespread, attention, throughout, europe, several, scholars, now, believe, that, vespucci, did, not, write, the, two, published, letters, in, the, form, in, which, they, circulated, during, his, lifetime, they, suggest, that, they, were, fabrications, based, in, part, on, genuine, vespucci, letters, the, remaining, documents, were, unpublished, manuscripts, handwritten, letters, uncovered, by, researchers, more, than, 250, years, after, vespucci, s, death, after, years, of, controversy, the, authenticity, of, the, three, complete, letters, was, convincingly, demonstrated, by, alberto, magnaghi, in, 1924, most, historians, now, accept, them, as, the, work, of, vespucci, but, aspects, of, the, accounts, are, still, disputed, vespucci, has, been, called, the, most, enigmatic, and, controversial, figure, in, early, american, history, the, debate, has, become, known, among, historians, as, the, vespucci, question, how, many, voyages, did, he, make, what, was, his, role, on, the, voyages, and, what, did, he, learn, the, evidence, relies, almost, entirely, on, a, handful, of, letters, attributed, to, him, many, historians, have, analysed, these, documents, and, have, arrived, at, contradictory, conclusions, in, 1515, sebastian, cabot, became, one, of, the, first, to, question, vespucci, s, accomplishments, and, express, doubts, about, his, 1497, voyage, later, bartolom, de, las, casas, argued, that, vespucci, was, a, liar, and, stole, the, credit, that, was, due, columbus, by, 1600, most, regarded, vespucci, as, an, impostor, and, not, worthy, of, his, honours, and, fame, in, 1839, alexander, von, humboldt, after, careful, consideration, asserted, the, 1497, voyage, was, impossible, but, accepted, the, two, portuguese, sponsored, voyages, humboldt, also, called, into, question, the, assertion, that, vespucci, recognized, that, he, had, encountered, a, new, continent, according, to, humboldt, vespucci, and, columbus, died, in, the, belief, that, they, had, reached, the, eastern, edge, of, asia, vespucci, s, reputation, was, perhaps, at, its, lowest, in, 1856, when, ralph, waldo, emerson, called, vespucci, a, thief, and, pickle, dealer, from, seville, who, managed, to, get, half, the, world, baptized, with, his, dishonest, name, opinions, began, to, shift, somewhat, after, 1857, when, brazilian, historian, francisco, adolfo, de, varnhagen, wrote, that, everything, in, the, soderini, letter, was, true, other, historians, followed, in, support, of, vespucci, including, john, fiske, and, henry, harrisse, in, 1924, alberto, magnaghi, published, the, results, of, his, exhaustive, review, of, vespucci, s, writings, and, relevant, cartography, he, denied, vespucci, s, authorship, of, the, 1503, mundus, novus, and, the, 1505, letter, to, soderini, the, only, two, texts, published, during, his, lifetime, he, suggested, that, the, soderini, letter, was, not, written, by, vespucci, but, was, cobbled, together, by, unscrupulous, florentine, publishers, who, combined, several, accounts, some, from, vespucci, others, from, elsewhere, magnaghi, determined, that, the, manuscript, letters, were, authentic, and, based, on, them, he, was, the, first, to, propose, that, only, the, second, and, third, voyages, were, true, and, the, first, and, fourth, voyages, only, found, in, the, soderini, letter, were, fabrications, while, magnaghi, has, been, one, of, the, chief, proponents, of, a, two, voyage, narrative, roberto, levellier, was, an, influential, argentinian, historian, who, endorsed, the, authenticity, of, all, vespucci, s, letters, and, proposed, the, most, extensive, itinerary, for, his, four, voyages, other, modern, historians, and, popular, writers, have, taken, varying, positions, on, vespucci, s, letters, and, voyages, espousing, two, three, or, four, voyages, and, supporting, or, denying, the, authenticity, of, his, two, printed, letters, most, authors, believe, that, the, three, manuscript, letters, are, authentic, while, the, first, voyage, as, described, in, the, soderini, letter, draws, the, most, criticism, and, disbelief, a, two, voyage, thesis, was, accepted, and, popularized, by, frederick, j, pohl, 1944, and, rejected, by, germ, n, arciniegas, 1955, who, posited, that, all, four, voyages, were, truthful, luciano, formisiano, 1992, also, rejects, the, magnaghi, thesis, acknowledging, that, publishers, probably, tampered, with, vespucci, s, writings, and, declares, all, four, voyages, genuine, but, differs, from, arciniegas, in, details, particularly, the, first, voyage, samuel, morison, 1974, flatly, rejected, the, first, voyage, but, was, noncommittal, about, the, two, published, letters, felipe, fern, ndez, armesto, 2007, calls, the, authenticity, question, inconclusive, and, hypothesizes, that, the, first, voyage, was, probably, another, version, of, the, second, the, third, is, unassailable, and, the, fourth, is, probably, true, vespucci, s, historical, importance, may, rest, more, with, his, letters, whether, or, not, he, wrote, them, all, than, his, discoveries, burckhardt, cites, the, naming, of, america, after, him, as, an, example, of, the, immense, role, of, the, italian, literature, of, the, time, in, determining, historical, memory, within, a, few, years, of, the, publication, of, his, two, letters, the, european, public, became, aware, of, the, newly, discovered, continents, of, the, americas, according, to, vespucci, concerning, my, return, from, those, new, regions, which, we, found, and, explored, we, may, rightly, call, a, new, world, because, our, ancestors, had, no, knowledge, of, them, and, it, will, be, a, matter, wholly, new, to, all, those, who, hear, about, them, for, this, transcends, the, view, held, by, our, ancients, inasmuch, as, most, of, them, hold, that, there, is, no, continent, to, the, south, beyond, the, equator, but, only, the, sea, which, they, named, the, atlantic, and, if, some, of, them, did, aver, that, a, continent, there, was, they, denied, with, abundant, argument, that, it, was, a, habitable, land, but, that, this, their, opinion, is, false, and, utterly, opposed, to, the, truth, my, last, voyage, has, made, manifest, for, in, those, southern, parts, i, have, found, a, continent, more, densely, peopled, and, abounding, in, animals, than, our, europe, or, asia, or, africa, and, in, addition, a, climate, milder, and, more, delightful, than, in, any, other, region, known, to, us, as, you, shall, learn, in,
