the, revue, de, paris, laughter, le, rire, one, of, the, most, important, of, bergson, s, minor, works, this, essay, on, the, meaning, of, comedy, stemmed, from, a, lecture, he, had, given, in, his, early, days, in, auvergne, the, study, of, it, is, essential, to, an, understanding, of, bergson, s, views, of, life, especially, its, passages, dealing, with, the, place, of, the, artistic, in, life, the, paper, s, main, thesis, is, that, laughter, is, a, corrective, evolved, to, make, social, life, possible, for, human, beings, people, laugh, at, those, who, fail, to, adapt, to, society, s, demands, of, society, if, it, seems, their, failure, is, akin, to, an, inflexible, mechanism, comic, authors, have, exploited, this, human, tendency, to, laugh, in, various, ways, and, what, is, common, to, them, is, the, idea, that, the, comic, consists, in, something, mechanical, encrusted, on, the, living, in, 1901, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, morales, et, politiques, elected, bergson, as, a, member, in, 1903, he, contributed, to, the, revue, de, m, taphysique, et, de, morale, an, essay, introduction, to, metaphysics, introduction, la, metaphysique, which, is, useful, as, a, preface, to, the, study, of, his, three, large, books, he, detailed, in, this, essay, his, philosophical, program, realized, in, the, creative, evolution, on, the, death, of, gabriel, tarde, the, sociologist, and, philosopher, in, 1904, bergson, succeeded, him, as, chair, of, modern, philosophy, from, 4, to, 8, september, of, that, year, he, visited, geneva, attending, the, second, international, congress, of, philosophy, when, he, lectured, on, the, mind, and, thought, a, philosophical, illusion, le, cerveau, et, la, pens, e, une, illusion, philosophique, an, illness, prevented, his, visiting, germany, to, attend, the, third, congress, held, at, heidelberg, in, these, years, bergson, strongly, influenced, jacques, maritain, perhaps, even, saving, maritain, and, his, wife, ra, ssa, from, suicide, bergson, s, third, major, work, creative, evolution, the, most, widely, known, and, most, discussed, of, his, books, appeared, in, 1907, pierre, imbart, de, la,

per, annum, for, ten, years, following, the, appearance, of, this, book, bergson, s, popularity, increased, enormously, not, only, in, academic, circles, but, among, the, general, public, at, that, time, bergson, had, already, extensively, studied, biology, including, the, theory, of, fecundation, as, shown, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, creative, evolution, which, had, only, recently, emerged, ca, 1885, no, small, feat, for, a, philosopher, specializing, in, the, history, of, philosophy, in, particular, greek, and, roman, philosophy, he, also, most, certainly, had, read, apart, from, darwin, haeckel, from, whom, he, retained, his, idea, of, a, unity, of, life, and, of, the, ecological, solidarity, between, all, living, beings, as, well, as, hugo, de, vries, from, whom, he, quoted, his, mutation, theory, of, evolution, which, he, opposed, preferring, darwin, s, gradualism, he, also, quoted, charles, douard, brown, s, quard, the, successor, of, claude, bernard, at, the, chair, of, experimental, medicine, in, the, coll, ge, de, france, bergson, served, as, a, juror, with, florence, meyer, blumenthal, in, awarding, the, prix, blumenthal, a, grant, given, between, 1919, and, 1954, to, painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and, musicians, bergson, travelled, to, london, in, 1908, and, met, there, with, william, james, the, harvard, university, philosopher, who, was, bergson, s, senior, by, 17, years, and, who, was, instrumental, in, calling, bergson, s, work, to, the, attention, of, the, anglo, american, public, the, two, became, great, friends, james, s, impression, of, bergson, is, given, in, his, letters, under, the, date, of, 4, october, 1908, so, modest, and, unpretending, a, man, but, such, a, genius, intellectually, i, have, the, strongest, suspicions, that, the, tendency, which, he, has, brought, to, a, focus, will, end, by, prevailing, and, that, the, present, epoch, will, be, a, sort, of, turning, point, in, the, history, of, philosophy, as, early, as, 1880, james, had, contributed, an, article, in, french, to, the, periodical, la, critique, philosophique, of, renouvier, and, pillon, titled, le, sentiment, de, l, effort, four, years, later, a, couple, of, articles, by, him, appeared, in, the, journal, mind, what, is, an, emotion, and, on, some, omissions, of, introspective, psychology, bergson, quoted, the, first, two, of, these, in, time, and, free, will, in, 1890, 91, appeared, the, two, volumes, of, james, s, monumental, work, the, principles, of, psychology, in, which, he, refers, to, a, pathological, phenomenon, bergson, observed, some, writers, taking, merely, these, dates, into, consideration, and, overlooking, that, james, s, investigations, had, been, proceeding, since, 1870, registered, from, time, to, time, by, various, articles, that, culminated, in, the, principles, have, mistakenly, dated, bergson, s, ideas, as, earlier, than, james, s, william, james, hailed, bergson, as, an, ally, in, 1903, he, wrote, i, have, been, re, reading, bergson, s, books, and, nothing, that, i, have, read, for, years, has, so, excited, and, stimulated, my, thoughts, i, am, sure, that, his, philosophy, has, a, great, future, it, breaks, through, old, frameworks, and, brings, things, to, a, solution, from, which, new, crystallizations, can, be, reached, the, most, noteworthy, tributes, james, paid, to, bergson, come, in, the, hibbert, lectures, a, pluralistic, universe, which, james, gave, at, manchester, college, oxford, shortly, after, meeting, bergson, in, london, he, remarks, on, the, encouragement, he, gained, from, bergson, s, thought, and, refers, to, his, confidence, in, being, able, to, lean, on, bergson, s, authority, bergson, s, influence, had, led, james, to, renounce, the, intellectualist, method, and, the, current, notion, that, logic, is, an, adequate, measure, of, what, can, or, cannot, be, it, had, induced, him, he, continued, to, give, up, logic, squarely, and, irrevocably, as, a, method, for, he, found, that, reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use, what, word, you, will, exceeds, our, logic, overflows, and, surrounds, it, these, remarks, which, appeared, in, james, s, book, a, pluralistic, universe, in, 1909, impelled, many, english, and, american, readers, to, investigate, bergson, s, philosophy, but, no, english, translations, of, bergson, s, major, work, had, yet, appeared, james, encouraged, and, assisted, arthur, mitchell, in, preparing, an, english, translation, of, creative, evolution, in, august, 1910, james, died, it, was, his, intention, had, he, lived, to, see, the, translation, finished, to, introduce, it, to, the, english, reading, public, by, a, prefatory, note, of, appreciation, the, next, year, the, translation, was, completed, and, still, greater, interest, in, bergson, and, his, work, ensued, by, coincidence, in, that, same, year, 1911, bergson, wrote, a, 16, page, preface, truth, and, reality, to, the, french, translation, of, james, s, book, pragmatism, in, it, he, expressed, sympathetic, appreciation, of, james, s, work, together, with, certain, important, reservations, from, 5, to, 11, april, bergson, attended, the, fourth, international, congress, of, philosophy, held, at, bologna, in, italy, where, he, gave, an, address, on, philosophical, intuition, in, response, to, invitations, he, visited, england, in, may, of, that, year, and, on, several, subsequent, occasions, these, visits, were, well, received, his, speeches, offered, new, perspectives, and, elucidated, many, passages, in, his, three, major, works, time, and, free, will, matter, and, memory, and, creative, evolution, although, necessarily, brief, statements, they, developed, and, enriched, the, ideas, in, his, books, and, clarified, for, english, audiences, the, fundamental, principles, of, his, philosophy, in, may, 1911, bergson, gave, two, lectures, the, perception, of, change, la, perception, du, changement, at, the, university, of, oxford, the, clarendon, press, published, these, in, french, in, the, same, year, his, talks, were, concise, and, lucid, leading, students, and, the, general, reader, to, his, other, longer, writings, oxford, later, conferred, on, him, the, degree, of, doctor, of, science, two, days, later, he, delivered, the, huxley, lecture, at, the, university, of, birmingham, taking, for, his, subject, life, and, consciousness, this, subsequently, appeared, in, the, hibbert, journal, october, 1911, and, revised, is, the, first, essay, in, the, collected, volume, mind, energy, l, nergie, spirituelle, in, october, he, again, travelled, to, england, where, he, had, an, enthusiastic, reception, and, delivered, at, university, college, london, four, lectures, on, la, nature, de, l, me, the, nature, of, the, soul, in, 1913, bergson, visited, the, united, states, of, america, at, the, invitation, of, columbia, university, and, lectured, in, several, american, cities, where, very, large, audiences, welcomed, him, in, february, at, columbia, he, lectured, both, in, french, and, english, taking, as, his, subjects, spirituality, and, freedom, and, the, method, of, philosophy, being, again, in, england, in, may, of, that, year, he, accepted, the, presidency, of, the, british, society, for, psychical, research, and, delivered, to, it, an, address, phantoms, of, life, and, psychic, research, fant, mes, des, vivants, et, recherche, psychique, meanwhile, his, popularity, increased, and, translations, of, his, work, began, to, appear, in, a, number, of, languages, english, german, italian, danish, swedish, hungarian, polish, and, russian, in, 1914, bergson, s, countrymen, honoured, him, by, his, election, as, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, he, was, also, made, president, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, morales, et, politiques, and, became, officier, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, and, officier, de, l, instruction, publique, bergson, found, disciples, of, many, types, in, france, movements, such, as, neo, catholicism, and, modernism, on, the, one, hand, and, syndicalism, on, the, other, endeavoured, to, absorb, and, appropriate, for, their, own, ends, some, of, his, central, ideas, the, continental, organ, of, socialist, and, syndicalist, theory, le, mouvement, socialiste, portrayed, the, realism, of, karl, marx, and, pierre, joseph, proudhon, as, hostile, to, all, forms, of, intellectualism, and, argued, therefore, that, supporters, of, marxist, socialism, should, welcome, a, philosophy, such, as, bergson, s, other, writers, in, their, eagerness, claimed, that, the, thought, of, the, holder, of, the, chair, of, philosophy, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, and, the, aims, of, the, conf, d, ration, g, n, rale, du, travail, and, the, industrial, workers, of, the, world, were, in, essential, agreement, while, social, revolutionaries, endeavoured, to, make, the, most, out, of, bergson, many, religious, leaders, particularly, the, more, liberal, minded, theologians, of, all, creeds, e, g, the, modernists, and, neo, catholic, party, in, his, own, country,

faith, heart, and, sentiment, to, dogmas, speculative, theology, and, abstract, reasoning, like, bergson, s, his, writings, were, placed, on, the, index, by, the, vatican, in, 1922, bergson, s, book, dur, e, et, simultan, it, propos, de, la, th, orie, d, einstein, duration, and, simultaneity, bergson, and, the, einsteinian, universe, was, published, earlier, that, year, albert, einstein, had, come, to, the, french, society, of, philosophy, and, briefly, replied, to, a, short, speech, made, by, bergson, it, has, been, alleged, that, bergson, s, knowledge, of, physics, was, insufficient, and, that, the, book, did, not, follow, up, contemporary, developments, on, physics, on, the, other, hand, in, einstein, and, the, crisis, of, reason, a, leading, french, philosopher, maurice, merleau, ponty, accused, einstein, of, failing, to, grasp, bergson, s, argument, this, argument, merleau, ponty, says, which, concerns, not, the, physics, of, special, relativity, but, its, philosophical, foundations, addresses, paradoxes, caused, by, popular, interpretations, and, misconceptions, about, the, theory, including, einstein, s, own, duration, and, simultaneity, was, not, published, in, the, 1951, edition, du, centenaire, in, french, which, contained, all, of, his, other, works, and, was, only, published, later, in, a, work, gathering, different, essays, titled, m, langes, this, work, took, advantage, of, bergson, s, experience, at, the, league, of, nations, where, he, presided, from, 1920, to, 1925, over, the, international, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, the, ancestor, of, unesco, and, which, included, einstein, and, marie, curie, while, living, with, his, wife, and, daughter, in, a, modest, house, in, a, quiet, street, near, the, porte, d, auteuil, in, paris, bergson, won, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, in, 1927, for, the, creative, evolution, because, of, serious, rheumatic, ailments, he, could, not, travel, to, stockholm, and, sent, instead, a, text, subsequently, published, in, la, pens, e, et, le, mouvant, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1928, after, his, retirement, from, the, coll, ge, de, france, bergson, began, to, fade, into, obscurity, he, suffered, from, a, degenerative, illness, rheumatism, which, left, him, half, paralyzed, he, completed, his, new, work, the, two, sources, of, morality, and, religion, which, extended, his, philosophical, theories, to, the, realms, of, morality, religion, and, art, in, 1932, it, was, respectfully, received, by, the, public, and, the, philosophical, community, but, all, by, that, time, realized, that, bergson, s, days, as, a, philosophical, luminary, were, past, he, was, however, able, to, reiterate, his, core, beliefs, near, the, end, of, his, life, by, renouncing, all, the, posts, and, honours, previously, awarded, him, rather, than, accept, exemption, from, the, antisemitic, laws, of, the, vichy, government, bergson, inclined, to, convert, to, catholicism, writing, in, his, will, on, 7, february, 1937, my, thinking, has, always, brought, me, nearer, to, catholicism, in, which, i, saw, the, perfect, complement, to, judaism, though, wishing, to, convert, to, catholicism, as, stated, in, his, will, he, did, not, do, so, in, view, of, the, travails, inflicted, on, the, jewish, people, by, the, rise, of, nazism, and, antisemitism, in, europe, in, the, 1930s, he, did, not, want, to, appear, to, want, to, leave, the, persecuted, after, the, fall, of, france, in, 1940, jews, in, occupied, france, were, required, to, register, at, police, stations, when, completing, his, police, form, bergson, made, the, following, entry, academic, philosopher, nobel, prize, winner, jew, it, was, the, position, of, the, archbishop, of, paris, emmanuel, c, lestin, suhard, that, the, public, revelation, of, bergson, s, conversion, was, too, dangerous, at, the, time, when, the, city, was, occupied, by, the, nazis, to, both, the, church, and, the, jewish, population, on, 3, january, 1941, bergson, died, in, occupied, paris, of, bronchitis, a, roman, catholic, priest, said, prayers, at, his, funeral, per, his, request, bergson, is, buried, in, the, cimeti, re, de, garches, hauts, de, seine, bergson, rejected, what, he, saw, as, the, overly, mechanistic, predominant, view, of, causality, as, expressed, in, reductionism, he, argued, that, free, will, must, be, allowed, to, unfold, in, an, autonomous, and, unpredictable, fashion, while, kant, saw, free, will, as, something, beyond, time, and, space, and, therefore, ultimately, a, matter, of, faith, bergson, attempted, to, redefine, the, modern, conceptions, of, time, space, and, causality, in, his, concept, of, duration, making, room, for, a, tangible, marriage, of, free, will, with, causality, seeing, duration, as, a, mobile, and, fluid, concept, bergson, argued, that, one, cannot, understand, duration, through, immobile, analysis, but, only, through, experiential, first, person, intuition, bergson, considers, the, appearance, of, novelty, as, a, result, of, pure, undetermined, creation, instead, of, as, the, predetermined, result, of, mechanistic, forces, his, philosophy, emphasizes, pure, mobility, unforeseeable, novelty, creativity, and, freedom, thus, one, can, characterize, his, system, as, a, process, philosophy, it, touches, upon, such, topics, as, time, and, identity, free, will, perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the, foundation, of, mathematics, and, the, limits, of, reason, criticizing, kant, s, theory, of, knowledge, exposed, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, and, his, conception, of, truth, which, he, compares, to, plato, s, conception, of, truth, as, its, symmetrical, inversion, order, of, nature, order, of, thought, bergson, attempted, to, redefine, the, relations, between, science, and, metaphysics, intelligence, and, intuition, and, insisted, on, the, necessity, of, increasing, thought, s, possibility, through, the, use, of, intuition, which, according, to, him, alone, approached, a, knowledge, of, the, absolute, and, of, real, life, understood, as, pure, duration, because, of, his, relative, criticism, of, intelligence, he, makes, frequent, use, of, images, and, metaphors, in, his, writings, in, order, to, avoid, the, use, of, concepts, which, he, considers, fail, to, touch, the, whole, of, reality, being, only, a, sort, of, abstract, net, thrown, on, things, for, instance, he, says, in, the, creative, evolution, chap, iii, that, thought, in, itself, would, never, have, thought, it, possible, for, the, human, being, to, swim, as, it, cannot, deduce, swimming, from, walking, for, swimming, to, be, possible, man, must, throw, himself, in, water, and, only, then, can, thought, to, consider, swimming, as, possible, intelligence, for, bergson, is, a, practical, faculty, rather, than, a, pure, speculative, faculty, a, product, of, evolution, used, by, man, to, survive, if, metaphysics, is, to, avoid, false, problems, it, should, not, extend, the, abstract, concepts, of, intelligence, to, pure, speculation, but, rather, use, intuition, the, creative, evolution, in, particular, attempted, to, think, through, the, continuous, creation, of, life, and, explicitly, pitted, itself, against, herbert, spencer, s, evolutionary, philosophy, spencer, had, attempted, to, transpose, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, in, philosophy, and, to, construct, a, cosmology, based, on, this, theory, spencer, also, coined, the, expression, survival, of, the, fittest, bergson, disputed, what, he, saw, as, spencer, s, mechanistic, philosophy, bergson, s, lebensphilosophie, philosophy, of, life, can, be, seen, as, a, response, to, the, mechanistic, philosophies, of, his, time, but, also, to, the, failure, of, finalism, indeed, he, considers, that, finalism, is, unable, to, explain, duration, and, the, continuous, creation, of, life, as, it, only, explains, life, as, the, progressive, development, of, an, initially, determined, program, a, notion, which, remains, for, example, in, the, expression, of, a, genetic, program, such, a, description, of, finalism, was, adopted, for, instance, by, leibniz, bergson, regards, planning, for, the, future, as, impossible, since, time, itself, unravels, unforeseen, possibilities, indeed, one, can, always, explain, a, historical, event, retrospectively, by, its, conditions, of, possibility, but, in, the, introduction, to, the, pens, e, et, le, mouvant, he, explains, that, such, an, event, retrospectively, created, its, causes, taking, the, example, of, the, creation, of, a, work, of, art, for, example, a, symphony, it, was, impossible, to, predict, a, future, symphony, as, if, the, composer, knew, what, symphony, would, be, best, and, wrote, it, in, his, words, the, effect, created, its, cause, henceforth, he, attempted, to, find, a, third, way, between, mechanism, and, finalism, through, the, notion, of, an, original, impulse, the, lan, vital, in, life, which, disperses, itself, through, evolution, into, contradictory, tendencies, he, substituted, for, the, finalist, notion, of, a, teleological, aim, the, notion, of, an, original, impulse, the, foundation, of, henri, bergson, s, philosophy, his, theory, of, duration, he, discovered, when, trying, to, improve, what, he, saw, as, the, inadequacies, of, herbert, spencer, s, philosophy, bergson, introduced, duration, as, a, theory, of, time, and, consciousness, in, his, doctoral, thesis, time, and, free, will, an, essay, on, the, immediate, data, of, consciousness, as, a, response, to, another, of, his, influences, immanuel, kant, kant, believed, that, free, will, could, only, exist, outside, of, time, and, space, indeed, the, only, non, determined, aspect, of, private, existence, in, the, universe, separate, from, water, cycles, mathematics, and, mortality, however, it, could, therefore, not, be, ascertained, whether, or, not, it, exists, and, that, it, is, nothing, but, a, pragmatic, faith, bergson, responded, that, kant, along, with, many, other, philosophers, had, confused, time, with, its, spatial, representation, in, reality, bergson, argued, duration, is, unextended, yet, heterogeneous, and, so, its, parts, cannot, be, juxtaposed, as, a, succession, of, distinct, parts, with, one, causing, the, other, based, on, this, he, concluded, that, determinism, is, an, impossibility, and, free, will, pure, mobility, which, is, what, bergson, identified, as, being, the, duration, for, bergson, reality, is, composed, of, change, duration, as, defined, by, bergson, then, is, a, unity, and, a, multiplicity, but, being, mobile, it, cannot, be, grasped, through, immobile, concepts, bergson, hence, argues, that, one, can, grasp, it, only, through, his, method, of, intuition, two, images, from, henri, bergson, s, an, introduction, to, metaphysics, may, help, one, to, grasp, bergson, s, term, intuition, the, limits, of, concepts, and, the, ability, of, intuition, to, grasp, the, absolute, the, first, image, is, that, of, a, city, analysis, or, the, creation, of, concepts, through, the, divisions, of, points, of, view, can, only, ever, offer, a, model, of, the, city, through, a, construction, of, photographs, taken, from, every, possible, point, of, view, yet, it, can, never, produce, the, dimensional, value, of, walking, in, the, city, itself, one, can, only, grasp, this, through, intuition, likewise, the, experience, of, reading, a, line, of, homer, one, may, translate, the, line, and, pile, commentary, upon, commentary, but, this, commentary, too, shall, never, grasp, the, simple, dimensional, value, of, experiencing, the, poem, in, its, originality, itself, the, method, of, intuition, then, is, that, of, getting, back, to, the, things, themselves, lan, vital, ranks, as, bergson, s, third, essential, concept, after, duration, and, intuition, an, idea, with, the, goal, of, explaining, evolution, the, lan, vital, first, appeared, in, 1907, s, creative, evolution, bergson, portrays, lan, vital, as, a, kind, of, vital, impetus, which, explains, evolution, in, a, less, mechanical, and, more, lively, manner, as, well, as, accounting, for, the, creative, impulse, of, mankind, this, concept, led, several, authors, to, characterize, bergson, as, a, supporter, of, vitalism, although, he, criticized, it, explicitly, in, the, creative, evolution, as, he, thought, against, driesch, and, johannes, reinke, whom, he, cited, that, there, is, neither, purely, internal, finality, nor, clearly, cut, individuality, in, nature, hereby, lies, the, stumbling, block, of, vitalist, theories, it, is, thus, in, vain, that, one, pretends, to, reduce, finality, to, the, individuality, of, the, living, being, if, there, is, finality, in, the, world, of, life, it, encompasses, the, whole, of, life, in, one, indivisible, embrace, in, laughter, an, essay, on, the, meaning, of, the, comic, bergson, develops, a, theory, not, of, laughter, itself, but, of, how, laughter, can, be, provoked, see, his, objection, to, delage, published, in, the, 23rd, edition, of, the, essay, he, describes, the, process, of, laughter, refusing, to, give, a, conceptual, definition, which, would, not, approach, its, reality, used, in, particular, by, comics, and, clowns, as, caricature, of, the, mechanistic, nature, of, humans, habits, automatic, acts, etc, one, of, the, two, tendencies, of, life, degradation, towards, inert, matter, and, mechanism, and, continual, creation, of, new, forms, however, bergson, warns, that, laughter, s, criterion, of, what, should, be, laughed, at, is, not, a, moral, criterion, and, that, it, can, in, fact, cause, serious, damage, to, a, person, s, self, esteem, this, essay, made, his, opposition, to, the, cartesian, theory, of, the, animal, machine, obvious, from, his, first, publications, bergson, s, philosophy, attracted, strong, criticism, from, different, quarters, although, he, also, became, very, popular, and, durably, influenced, french, philosophy, the, mathematician, douard, le, roy, became, bergson, s, main, disciple, nonetheless, suzanne, guerlac, has, argued, that, his, institutional, position, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, delivering, lectures, to, a, general, audience, may, have, retarded, the, systematic, reception, of, his, thought, bergson, achieved, enormous, popular, success, in, this, context, often, due, to, the, emotional, appeal, of, his, ideas, but, he, did, not, have, the, equivalent, of, graduate, students, who, might, have, become, rigorous, interpreters, of, his, thought, thus, bergson, s, philosophy, in, principle, open, and, nonsystematic, was, easily, borrowed, piecemeal, and, altered, by, enthusiastic, admirers, alfred, north, whitehead, acknowledged, bergson, s, influence, on, his, process, philosophy, in, his, 1929, process, and, reality, however, bertrand, russell, whitehead, s, collaborator, on, principia, mathematica, was, not, so, entranced, by, bergson, s, philosophy, although, acknowledging, bergson, s, literary, skills, russell, saw, bergson, s, arguments, at, best, as, persuasive, or, emotive, speculation, but, not, at, all, as, any, worthwhile, example, of, sound, reasoning, or, philosophical, insight, the, epistemologist, gaston, bachelard, explicitly, alluded, to, him, in, the, last, pages, of, his, 1938, book, the, formation, of, the, scientific, mind, others, influenced, by, bergson, include, vladimir, jank, l, vitch, who, wrote, a, book, on, him, in, 1931, pierre, teilhard, de, chardin, and, gilles, deleuze, who, wrote, le, bergsonisme, in, 1966, the, greek, philosopher, helle, lambridis, developed, an, interest, in, bergson, early, in, her, career, and, after, two, publications, in, 1929, a, book, that, introduced, bergson, s, work, to, the, greek, audience, and, a, translation, into, greek, of, bergson, s, book, l, nergie, spirituelle, 1919, the, second, part, of, her, introduction, to, philosophy, i, ii, 1965, included, his, philosophical, work, on, the, concept, of, time, although, this, part, ii, was, not, published, until, 2004, bergson, also, influenced, the, phenomenology, of, maurice, merleau, ponty, and, emmanuel, levinas, although, merleau, ponty, had, reservations, about, bergson, s, philosophy, the, greek, author, nikos, kazantzakis, studied, under, bergson, in, paris, and, his, writing, and, philosophy, were, profoundly, influenced, as, a, result, many, writers, of, the, early, 20th, century, criticized, bergson, s, intuitionism, indeterminism, psychologism, and, interpretation, of, the, scientific, impulse, those, who, explicitly, criticized, bergson, either, in, published, articles, or, in, letters, included, bertrand, russell, george, santayana, g, e, moore, ludwig, wittgenstein, martin, heidegger, julien, benda, t, s, eliot, wyndham, lewis, wallace, stevens, though, stevens, also, praised, him, in, his, work, the, necessary, angel, paul, val, ry, andr, gide, jean, piaget, marxist, philosophers, theodor, w, adorno, lucio, colletti, jean, paul, sartre, and, georges, politzer, as, well, as, maurice, blanchot, american, philosophers, such, as, irving, babbitt, arthur, lovejoy, josiah, royce, the, new, realists, ralph, b, perry, e, b, holt, and, william, pepperell, montague, the, critical, realists, durant, drake, roy, w, sellars, c, a, strong, and, a, k, rogers, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, roger, fry, see, his, letters, julian, huxley, in, evolution, the, modern, synthesis, and, virginia, woolf, for, the, latter, see, ann, banfield, the, phantom, table, the, vatican, accused, bergson, of, pantheism, while, others, have, characterized, his, philosophy, as, a, materialist, emergentism, samuel, alexander, and, c, lloyd, morgan, explicitly, claimed, bergson, as, their, forebear, according, to, henri, hude, 1990, ii, p, 142, who, supports, himself, on, the, whole, of, bergson, s, works, as, well, as, his, now, published, courses, accusing, him, of, pantheism, is, a, counter, sense, hude, alleges, that, a, mystical, experience, roughly, outlined, at, the, end, of, les, deux, sources, de, la, morale, et, de, la, religion, is, the, inner, principle, of, his, whole, philosophy, although, this, has, been, contested, by, other, commentators, charles, sanders, peirce, took, strong, exception, to, those, who, associated, him, with, bergson, in, response, to, a, letter, comparing, their, work, peirce, wrote, a, man, who, seeks, to, further, science, can, hardly, commit, a, greater, sin, than, to, use, the, terms, of, his, science, without, anxious, care, to, use, them, with, strict, accuracy, it, is, not, very, gratifying, to, my, feelings, to, be, classed, along, with, a, bergson, who, seems, to, be, doing, his, utmost, to, muddle, all, distinctions, peirce, also, comments, on, bergson, in, respect, to, a, proposed, book, on, his, semiotics, which, he, never, wrote, saying, i, feel, confident, the, book, would, make, a, serious, impression, much, deeper, and, surer, than, bergson, s, which, i, find, quite, too, vague, gilles, deleuze, however, saw, much, in, common, between, bergson, s, philosophy, and, that, of, peirce, exploring, the, many, connections, between, them, in, cinema, 1, the, movement, image, and, cinema, 2, the, time, image, as, the, deleuze, scholar, david, deamer, writes, deleuze, sets, about, aligning, bergson, s, sensory, motor, schema, with, the, semiosis, of, charles, sanders, peirce, from, pragmatism, and, pragmaticism, 1903, william, james, s, students, resisted, the, assimilation, of, his, work, to, that, of, bergson, see, for, example, horace, kallen, s, book, on, the, subject, james, and, bergson, as, jean, wahl, described, the, ultimate, disagreement, between, james, and, bergson, in, his, system, of, metaphysics, for, james, the, consideration, of, action, is, necessary, for, the, definition, of, truth, according, to, bergson, action, must, be, kept, from, our, mind, if, we, want, to, see, the, truth, gide, even, went, so, far, as, to, say, that, future, historians, will, overestimate, bergson, s, influence, on, art, and, philosophy, just, because, he, was, the, self, appointed, spokesman, for, the, spirit, of, the, age, as, early, as, the, 1890s, santayana, attacked, certain, key, concepts, in, bergson, s, philosophy, above, all, his, view, of, the, new, and, the, indeterminate, the, possibility, of, a, new, and, unaccountable, fact, appearing, at, any, time, he, writes, in, his, book, on, hermann, lotze, does, not, practically, affect, the, method, of, investigation, the, only, thing, given, up, is, the, hope, that, these, hypotheses, may, ever, be, adequate, to, the, reality, and, cover, the, process, of, nature, without, leaving, a, remainder, this, is, no, great, renunciation, for, that, consummation, of, science, is, by, no, one, really, expected, according, to, santayana, and, russell, bergson, projected, false, claims, onto, the, aspirations, of, scientific, method, claims, which, bergson, needed, to, make, in, order, to, justify, his, prior, moral, commitment, to, freedom, russell, takes, particular, exception, to, bergson, s, understanding, of, number, in, chapter, two, of, time, and, free, will, according, to, russell, bergson, uses, an, outmoded, spatial, metaphor, extended, images, to, describe, the, nature, of, mathematics, as, well, as, logic, in, general, bergson, only, succeeds, in, making, his, theory, of, number, plausible, by, confusing, a, particular, collection, with, the, number, of, its, terms, and, this, again, with, number, in, general, writes, russell, see, the, philosophy, of, bergson, and, a, history, of, western, philosophy, suzanne, guerlac, has, argued, that, the, more, recent, resurgence, of, scholarly, interest, in, bergson, is, related, to, the, growing, influence, of, his, follower, deleuze, within, continental, philosophy, if, there, is, a, return, to, bergson, today, then, it, is, largely, due, to, gilles, deleuze, whose, own, work, has, etched, the, contours, of, the, new, bergson, this, is, not, only, because, deleuze, wrote, about, bergson, it, is, also, because, deleuze, s, own, thought, is, deeply, engaged, with, that, of, his, predecessor, even, when, bergson, is, not, explicitly, mentioned, leonard, lawlor, and, valentine, moulard, agree, with, guerlac, that, the, recent, revitalization, of, bergsonism, is, almost, entirely, due, to, deleuze, they, explain, that, bergson, s, concept, of, multiplicity, is, at, the, very, heart, of, deleuze, s, thought, and, duration, is, the, model, for, all, of, deleuze, s, becomings, the, other, aspect, that, attracted, deleuze, which, is, indeed, connected, to, the, first, is, bergson, s, criticism, of, the, concept, of, negation, in, creative, evolution, thus, bergson, became, a, resource, in, the, criticism, of, the, hegelian, dialectic, the, negative, it, is, this, aspect, that, mark, sinclair, focuses, upon, in, bergson, 2020, he, writes, that, despite, the, philosopher, and, his, philosophy, being, very, popular, during, the, early, years, of, the, twentieth, century, his, ideas, had, been, critiqued, and, then, rejected, first, by, phenomenology, then, by, existentialism, and, finally, by, post, structuralism, as, sinclair, goes, on, to, explain, over, series, of, publications, including, bergsonism, 1966, and, difference, and, repetition, 1968, deleuze, championed, bergson, as, a, thinker, of, difference, that, precedes, any, sense, of, negation, in, this, way, deleuze, s, interpretation, served, to, keep, the, flame, of, bergson, s, philosophy, alive, and, it, has, been, a, key, motivation, for, the, renewed, scholarly, attention, to, it, ilya, prigogine, acknowledged, bergson, s, influence, at, his, nobel, prize, reception, lecture, since, my, adolescence, i, have, read, many, philosophical, texts, and, i, still, remember, the, spell, l, volution, cr, atrice, cast, on, me, more, specifically, i, felt, that, some, essential, message, was, embedded, still, to, be, made, explicit, in, bergson, s, remark, the, more, deeply, we, study, the, nature, of, time, the, better, we, understand, that, duration, means, invention, creation, of, forms, continuous, elaboration, of, the, absolutely, new, japanese, philosopher, yasushi, hirai, from, fukuoka, university, has, led, a, collaborative, and, interdisciplinary, project, since, 2007, bringing, together, eastern, and, western, philosophers, and, scientists, to, discuss, and, promote, bergson, s, work, this, has, influenced, the, development, of, specific, artificial, neural, networks, which, incorporate, features, inspired, by, bergson, s, philosophy, of, memory, in, the, matter, with, things, iain, mcgilchrist, extensively, cites, bergson, bergson, arrived, according, to, philosopher, peter, gunter, at, insights, closely, resembling, those, of, quantum, physics, only, bergson, got, there, first, several, hindu, authors, have, found, parallels, to, hindu, philosophy, in, bergson, s, thought, the, integrative, evolutionism, of, sri, aurobindo, an, indian, philosopher, from, the, early, 20th, century, has, many, similarities, to, bergson, s, philosophy, whether, this, represents, a, direct, influence, of, bergson, is, disputed, although, aurobindo, was, familiar, with, many, western, philosophers, k, narayanaswami, aiyer, a, member, of, the, theosophical, society, published, a, pamphlet, titled, professor, bergson, and, the, hindu, vedanta, where, he, argued, that, bergson, s, ideas, on, matter, consciousness, and, evolution, were, in, agreement, with, vedantic, and, puranic, explanations, nalini, kanta, brahma, marie, tudor, garland, and, hope, fitz, are, other, authors, who, have, comparatively, evaluated, hindu, and, bergsonian, philosophies, especially, in, relation, to, intuition, consciousness, and, evolution
