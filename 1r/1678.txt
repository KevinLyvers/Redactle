otto, hahn, pronounced, 8, march, 1879, 28, july, 1968, was, a, german, chemist, who, was, a, pioneer, in, the, fields, of, radioactivity, and, radiochemistry, he, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, nuclear, chemistry, and, father, of, nuclear, fission, hahn, and, lise, meitner, discovered, radioactive, isotopes, of, radium, thorium, protactinium, and, uranium, he, also, discovered, the, phenomena, of, atomic, recoil, and, nuclear, isomerism, and, pioneered, rubidium, strontium, dating, in, 1938, hahn, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, discovered, nuclear, fission, for, which, hahn, alone, was, awarded, the, 1944, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, nuclear, fission, was, the, basis, for, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, a, graduate, of, the, university, of, marburg, which, awarded, him, a, doctorate, in, 1901, hahn, studied, under, sir, william, ramsay, at, university, college, london, and, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, under, ernest, rutherford, where, he, discovered, several, new, radioactive, isotopes, he, returned, to, germany, in, 1906, emil, fischer, placed, a, former, woodworking, shop, in, the, basement, of, the, chemical, institute, at, the, university, of, berlin, at, his, disposal, to, use, as, a, laboratory, hahn, completed, his, habilitation, in, the, spring, of, 1907, and, became, a, privatdozent, in, 1912, he, became, head, of, the, radioactivity, department, of, the, newly, founded, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, working, with, the, austrian, physicist, lise, meitner, in, the, building, that, now, bears, their, names, he, made, a, series, of, groundbreaking, discoveries, culminating, with, her, isolation, of, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, protactinium, in, 1918, during, world, war, i, he, served, with, a, landwehr, regiment, on, the, western, front, and, with, the, chemical, warfare, unit, headed, by, fritz, haber, on, the, western, eastern, and, italian, fronts, earning, the, iron, cross, 2nd, class, for, his, part, in, the, first, battle, of, ypres, after, the, war, he, became, the, head, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, while, remaining, in, charge, of, his, own, department, between, 1934, and, 1938, he, worked, with, strassmann, and, meitner, on, the, study, of, isotopes, created, through, the, neutron, bombardment, of, uranium, and, thorium, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, he, was, an, opponent, of, national, socialism, and, the, persecution, of, jews, by, the, nazi, party, that, caused, the, removal, of, many, of, his, colleagues, including, meitner, who, was, forced, to, flee, germany, in, 1938, during, world, war, ii, he, worked, on, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, cataloguing, the, fission, products, of, uranium, as, a, consequence, at, the, end, of, the, war, he, was, arrested, by, the, allied, forces, he, was, detained, in, farm, hall, with, nine, other, german, scientists, from, july, 1945, to, january, 1946, hahn, served, as, the, last, president, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, 1946, and, as, the, founding, president, of, its, successor, the, max, planck, society, from, 1948, to, 1960, in, 1959, he, co, founded, in, berlin, the, federation, of, german, scientists, a, non, governmental, organization, which, has, been, committed, to, the, ideal, of, responsible, science, as, he, worked, to, rebuild, german, science, he, became, one, of, the, most, influential, and, respected, citizens, of, the, post, war, west, germany, otto, hahn, was, born, in, frankfurt, am, main, on, 8, march, 1879, the, youngest, son, of, heinrich, hahn, 1845, 1922, a, prosperous, glazier, and, founder, of, the, glasbau, hahn, company, and, charlotte, hahn, n, e, giese, 1845, 1905, he, had, an, older, half, brother, karl, his, mother, s, son, from, her, previous, marriage, and, two, older, brothers, heiner, and, julius, the, family, lived, above, his, father, s, workshop, the, younger, three, boys, were, educated, at, klinger, oberrealschule, in, frankfurt, at, the, age, of, 15, he, began, to, take, a, special, interest, in, chemistry, and, carried, out, simple, experiments, in, the, laundry, room, of, the, family, home, his, father, wanted, otto, to, study, architecture, as, he, had, built, or, acquired, several, residential, and, business, properties, but, otto, persuaded, him, that, his, ambition, was, to, become, an, industrial, chemist, in, 1897, after, passing, his, abitur, hahn, began, to, study, chemistry, at, the, university, of, marburg, his, subsidiary, subjects, were, mathematics, physics, mineralogy, and, philosophy, hahn, joined, the, students, association, of, natural, sciences, and, medicine, a, student, fraternity, and, a, forerunner, of, today, s, landsmannschaft, nibelungi, coburger, convent, der, akademischen, landsmannschaften, und, turnerschaften, he, spent, his, third, and, fourth, semesters, at, the, university, of, munich, studying, organic, chemistry, under, adolf, von, baeyer, physical, chemistry, under, friedrich, wilhelm, muthmann, and, inorganic, chemistry, under, karl, andreas, hofmann, in, 1901, hahn, received, his, doctorate, in, marburg, for, a, dissertation, entitled, on, bromine, derivates, of, isoeugenol, a, topic, in, classical, organic, chemistry, he, completed, his, one, year, military, service, instead, of, the, usual, two, because, he, had, a, doctorate, in, the, 81st, infantry, regiment, but, unlike, his, brothers, did, not, apply, for, a, commission, he, then, returned, to, the, university, of, marburg, where, he, worked, for, two, years, as, assistant, to, his, doctoral, supervisor, geheimrat, professor, theodor, zincke, hahn, s, intention, was, still, to, work, in, industry, he, received, an, offer, of, employment, from, eugen, fischer, the, director, of, kalle, co, and, the, father, of, organic, chemist, hans, fischer, but, a, condition, of, employment, was, that, hahn, had, to, have, lived, in, another, country, and, have, a, reasonable, command, of, another, language, with, this, in, mind, and, to, improve, his, knowledge, of, english, hahn, took, up, a, post, at, university, college, london, in, 1904, working, under, sir, william, ramsay, who, was, known, for, having, discovered, the, inert, gases, here, hahn, worked, on, radiochemistry, at, that, time, a, very, new, field, in, early, 1905, in, the, course, of, his, work, with, salts, of, radium, hahn, discovered, a, new, substance, he, called, radiothorium, thorium, 228, which, at, that, time, was, believed, to, be, a, new, radioactive, element, in, fact, it, was, an, isotope, of, the, known, element, thorium, the, concept, of, an, isotope, along, with, the, term, was, only, coined, in, 1913, by, the, british, chemist, frederick, soddy, ramsay, was, enthusiastic, when, yet, another, new, element, was, found, in, his, institute, and, he, intended, to, announce, the, discovery, in, a, correspondingly, suitable, way, in, accordance, with, tradition, this, was, done, before, the, committee, of, the, venerable, royal, society, at, the, session, of, the, royal, society, on, 16, march, 1905, ramsay, communicated, hahn, s, discovery, of, radiothorium, the, daily, telegraph, informed, its, readers, a, new, element, very, soon, the, scientific, papers, will, be, agog, with, a, new, discovery, which, has, been, added, to, the, many, brilliant, triumphs, of, gower, street, dr, otto, hahn, who, is, working, at, university, college, has, discovered, a, new, radioactive, element, extracted, from, a, mineral, from, ceylon, named, thorianite, and, possibly, it, is, conjectured, the, substance, which, renders, thorium, radioactive, its, activity, is, at, least, 250, 000, times, as, great, as, that, of, thorium, weight, for, weight, it, gives, off, a, gas, generally, called, an, emanation, identical, with, the, radioactive, emanation, from, thorium, another, theory, of, deep, interest, is, that, it, is, the, possible, source, of, a, radioactive, element, possibly, stronger, in, radioactivity, than, radium, itself, and, capable, of, producing, all, the, curious, effects, which, are, known, of, radium, up, to, the, present, the, discoverer, read, a, paper, on, the, subject, to, the, royal, society, last, week, and, this, should, rank, when, published, among, the, most, original, of, recent, contributions, to, scientific, literature, hahn, published, his, results, in, the, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, on, 24, may, 1905, it, was, the, first, of, over, 250, scientific, publications, of, otto, hahn, in, the, field, of, radiochemistry, at, the, end, of, his, time, in, london, ramsay, asked, hahn, about, his, plans, for, the, future, and, hahn, told, him, about, the, job, offer, from, kalle, co, ramsay, told, him, radiochemistry, had, a, bright, future, and, that, someone, who, had, discovered, a, new, radioactive, element, should, go, to, the, university, of, berlin, ramsay, wrote, to, emil, fischer, the, head, of, the, chemistry, institute, there, who, replied, that, hahn, could, work, in, his, laboratory, but, could, not, be, a, privatdozent, because, radiochemistry, was, not, taught, there, at, this, point, hahn, decided, that, he, first, needed, to, know, more, about, the, subject, so, he, wrote, to, the, leading, expert, on, the, field, ernest, rutherford, rutherford, agreed, to, take, hahn, on, as, an, assistant, and, hahn, s, parents, undertook, to, pay, hahn, s, expenses, from, september, 1905, until, mid, 1906, hahn, worked, with, rutherford, s, group, in, the, basement, of, the, macdonald, physics, building, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, there, was, some, scepticism, about, the, existence, of, radiothorium, which, bertram, boltwood, memorably, described, as, a, compound, of, thorium, x, and, stupidity, boltwood, was, soon, convinced, that, it, did, exist, although, he, and, hahn, differed, on, what, its, half, life, was, william, henry, bragg, and, richard, kleeman, had, noted, that, the, alpha, particles, emitted, from, radioactive, substances, always, had, the, same, energy, providing, a, second, way, of, identifying, them, so, hahn, set, about, measuring, the, alpha, particle, emissions, of, radiothorium, in, the, process, he, found, that, a, precipitation, of, thorium, a, polonium, 216, and, thorium, b, lead, 212, also, contained, a, short, lived, element, which, he, named, thorium, c, which, was, later, identified, as, polonium, 212, hahn, was, unable, to, separate, it, and, concluded, that, it, had, a, very, short, half, life, it, is, about, 300, ns, he, also, identified, radioactinium, thorium, 227, and, radium, d, later, identified, as, lead, 210, rutherford, remarked, that, hahn, has, a, special, nose, for, discovering, new, elements, in, 1906, hahn, returned, to, germany, where, fischer, placed, at, his, disposal, a, former, woodworking, shop, holzwerkstatt, in, the, basement, of, the, chemical, institute, to, use, as, a, laboratory, hahn, equipped, it, with, electroscopes, to, measure, alpha, and, beta, particles, and, gamma, rays, in, montreal, these, had, been, made, from, discarded, coffee, tins, hahn, made, the, ones, in, berlin, from, brass, with, aluminium, strips, insulated, with, amber, these, were, charged, with, hard, rubber, sticks, that, he, rubbed, then, against, the, sleeves, of, his, suit, it, was, not, possible, to, conduct, research, in, the, wood, shop, but, alfred, stock, the, head, of, the, inorganic, chemistry, department, let, hahn, use, a, space, in, one, of, his, two, private, laboratories, hahn, purchased, two, milligrams, of, radium, from, friedrich, oskar, giesel, the, discoverer, of, emanium, radon, for, 100, marks, a, milligram, and, obtained, thorium, for, free, from, otto, kn, fler, whose, berlin, firm, was, a, major, producer, of, thorium, products, in, the, space, of, a, few, months, hahn, discovered, mesothorium, i, radium, 228, mesothorium, ii, actinium, 228, and, independently, from, boltwood, the, mother, substance, of, radium, ionium, later, identified, as, thorium, 230, in, subsequent, years, mesothorium, i, assumed, great, importance, because, like, radium, 226, discovered, by, pierre, and, marie, curie, it, was, ideally, suited, for, use, in, medical, radiation, treatment, but, cost, only, half, as, much, to, manufacture, along, the, way, hahn, determined, that, just, as, he, was, unable, to, separate, thorium, from, radiothorium, so, he, could, not, separate, mesothorium, from, radium, in, canada, there, had, been, no, requirement, to, be, circumspect, when, addressing, the, egalitarian, new, zealander, rutherford, but, many, people, in, germany, found, his, manner, off, putting, and, characterised, him, as, an, anglicised, berliner, hahn, completed, his, habilitation, in, the, spring, of, 1907, and, became, a, privatdozent, a, thesis, was, not, required, the, chemical, institute, accepted, one, of, his, publications, on, radioactivity, instead, most, of, the, organic, chemists, at, the, chemical, institute, did, not, regard, hahn, s, work, as, real, chemistry, fischer, objected, to, hahn, s, contention, in, his, habilitation, colloquium, that, many, radioactive, substances, existed, in, such, tiny, amounts, that, they, could, only, be, detected, by, their, radioactivity, venturing, that, he, had, always, been, able, to, detect, substances, with, his, keen, sense, of, smell, but, soon, gave, in, one, department, head, remarked, it, is, incredible, what, one, gets, to, be, a, privatdozent, these, days, physicists, were, more, accepting, of, hahn, s, work, and, he, began, attending, a, colloquium, at, the, physics, institute, conducted, by, heinrich, rubens, it, was, at, one, of, these, colloquia, where, on, 28, september, 1907, he, made, the, acquaintance, of, the, austrian, physicist, lise, meitner, almost, the, same, age, as, himself, she, was, only, the, second, woman, to, receive, a, doctorate, from, the, university, of, vienna, and, had, already, published, two, papers, on, radioactivity, rubens, suggested, her, as, a, possible, collaborator, so, began, the, thirty, year, collaboration, and, lifelong, close, friendship, between, the, two, scientists, in, montreal, hahn, had, worked, with, physicists, including, at, least, one, woman, harriet, brooks, but, it, was, difficult, for, meitner, at, first, women, were, not, yet, admitted, to, universities, in, prussia, meitner, was, allowed, to, work, in, the, wood, shop, which, had, its, own, external, entrance, but, could, not, set, foot, in, the, rest, of, the, institute, including, hahn, s, laboratory, space, upstairs, if, she, wanted, to, go, to, the, toilet, she, had, to, use, one, at, the, restaurant, down, the, street, the, following, year, women, were, admitted, to, universities, and, fischer, lifted, the, restrictions, and, had, women, s, toilets, installed, in, the, building, the, institute, of, physics, was, more, accepting, than, chemists, and, she, became, friends, with, the, physicists, there, including, otto, von, baeyer, james, franck, gustav, hertz, robert, pohl, max, planck, peter, pringsheim, and, wilhelm, westphal, harriet, brooks, observed, a, radioactive, recoil, in, 1904, but, interpreted, it, wrongly, hahn, and, meitner, succeeded, in, demonstrating, the, radioactive, recoil, incident, to, alpha, particle, emission, and, interpreted, it, correctly, hahn, pursued, a, report, by, stefan, meyer, and, egon, schweidler, of, a, decay, product, of, actinium, with, a, half, life, of, about, 11, 8, days, hahn, determined, that, it, was, actinium, x, radium, 223, moreover, he, discovered, that, at, the, moment, when, a, radioactinium, thorium, 227, atom, emits, an, alpha, particle, it, does, so, with, great, force, and, the, actinium, x, experiences, a, recoil, this, is, enough, to, free, it, from, chemical, bonds, and, it, has, a, positive, charge, and, can, be, collected, at, a, negative, electrode, hahn, was, thinking, only, of, actinium, but, on, reading, his, paper, meitner, told, him, that, he, had, found, a, new, way, of, detecting, radioactive, substances, they, set, up, some, tests, and, soon, found, actinium, c, thallium, 207, and, thorium, c, thallium, 208, the, physicist, walther, gerlach, described, radioactive, recoil, as, a, profoundly, significant, discovery, in, physics, with, far, reaching, consequences, in, 1910, hahn, was, appointed, professor, by, the, prussian, minister, of, culture, and, education, august, von, trott, zu, solz, two, years, later, hahn, became, head, of, the, radioactivity, department, of, the, newly, founded, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, in, berlin, dahlem, in, what, is, today, the, hahn, meitner, building, of, the, free, university, of, berlin, this, came, with, an, annual, salary, of, 5, 000, marks, in, addition, he, received, 66, 000, marks, in, 1914, of, which, he, gave, 10, per, cent, to, meitner, from, kn, fler, for, the, mesothorium, process, the, new, institute, was, inaugurated, on, 23, october, 1912, in, a, ceremony, presided, over, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, the, kaiser, was, shown, glowing, radioactive, substances, in, a, dark, room, the, move, to, new, accommodation, was, fortuitous, as, the, wood, shop, had, become, thoroughly, contaminated, by, radioactive, liquids, that, had, been, spilt, and, radioactive, gases, that, had, vented, and, then, decayed, and, settled, as, radioactive, dust, making, sensitive, measurements, impossible, to, ensure, that, their, clean, new, laboratories, stayed, that, way, hahn, and, meitner, instituted, strict, procedures, chemical, and, physical, measurements, were, conducted, in, different, rooms, people, handling, radioactive, substances, had, to, follow, protocols, that, included, not, shaking, hands, and, rolls, of, toilet, paper, were, hung, next, to, every, telephone, and, door, handle, strongly, radioactive, substances, were, stored, in, the, old, wood, shop, and, later, in, a, purpose, built, radium, house, on, the, institute, grounds, with, a, regular, income, hahn, was, now, able, to, contemplate, marriage, in, june, 1911, while, attending, a, conference, in, stettin, hahn, met, edith, junghans, 1887, 1968, a, student, at, the, royal, school, of, art, in, berlin, they, saw, each, other, again, in, berlin, and, became, engaged, in, november, 1912, on, 22, march, 1913, the, couple, married, in, edith, s, native, city, of, stettin, where, her, father, paul, ferdinand, junghans, was, a, high, ranking, law, officer, and, president, of, the, city, parliament, until, his, death, in, 1915, after, a, honeymoon, at, punta, san, vigilio, on, lake, garda, in, italy, they, visited, vienna, and, then, budapest, where, they, stayed, with, george, de, hevesy, their, only, child, hanno, hahn, was, born, on, 9, april, 1922, during, world, war, ii, he, enlisted, in, the, army, in, 1942, and, served, with, distinction, on, the, eastern, front, as, a, panzer, commander, he, lost, an, arm, in, combat, after, the, war, he, became, a, distinguished, art, historian, and, architectural, researcher, at, the, hertziana, in, rome, known, for, his, discoveries, in, the, early, cistercian, architecture, of, the, 12th, century, in, august, 1960, while, on, a, study, trip, in, france, hanno, died, in, a, car, accident, together, with, his, wife, and, assistant, ilse, hahn, n, e, pletz, they, left, a, fourteen, year, old, son, dietrich, hahn, in, 1990, the, hanno, and, ilse, hahn, prize, for, outstanding, contributions, to, italian, art, history, was, established, in, memory, of, hanno, and, ilse, hahn, to, support, young, and, talented, art, historians, it, is, awarded, biennially, by, the, bibliotheca, hertziana, max, planck, institute, for, art, history, in, rome, in, july, 1914, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, hahn, was, recalled, to, active, duty, with, the, army, in, a, landwehr, regiment, they, marched, through, belgium, where, the, platoon, he, commanded, was, armed, with, captured, machine, guns, he, was, awarded, the, iron, cross, 2nd, class, for, his, part, in, the, first, battle, of, ypres, he, was, a, joyful, participant, in, the, christmas, truce, of, 1914, and, was, commissioned, as, a, lieutenant, in, mid, january, 1915, he, was, summoned, to, meet, chemist, fritz, haber, who, explained, his, plan, to, break, the, trench, deadlock, with, chlorine, gas, hahn, raised, the, issue, that, the, hague, convention, banned, the, use, of, projectiles, containing, poison, gases, but, haber, explained, that, the, french, had, already, initiated, chemical, warfare, with, tear, gas, grenades, and, he, planned, to, get, around, the, letter, of, the, convention, by, releasing, gas, from, cylinders, instead, of, shells, haber, s, new, unit, was, called, pioneer, regiment, 35, after, brief, training, in, berlin, hahn, together, with, physicists, james, franck, and, gustav, hertz, was, sent, to, flanders, again, to, scout, for, a, site, for, a, first, gas, attack, he, did, not, witness, the, attack, because, he, and, franck, were, off, selecting, a, position, for, the, next, attack, transferred, to, poland, at, the, battle, of, bolim, w, on, 12, june, 1915, they, released, a, mixture, of, chlorine, and, phosgene, gas, some, german, troops, were, reluctant, to, advance, when, the, gas, started, to, blow, back, so, hahn, led, them, across, no, man, s, land, he, witnessed, the, death, agonies, of, russians, they, had, poisoned, and, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, revive, some, with, gas, masks, he, was, transferred, to, berlin, as, a, human, guinea, pig, testing, poisonous, gases, and, gas, masks, on, their, next, attempt, on, 7, july, the, gas, again, blew, back, on, german, lines, and, hertz, was, poisoned, this, assignment, was, interrupted, by, a, mission, at, the, front, in, flanders, and, again, in, 1916, by, a, mission, to, verdun, to, introduce, shells, filled, with, phosgene, to, the, western, front, then, once, again, he, was, hunting, along, both, fronts, for, sites, for, gas, attacks, in, december, 1916, he, joined, the, new, gas, command, unit, at, imperial, headquarters, between, operations, hahn, returned, to, berlin, where, he, was, able, to, slip, back, to, his, old, laboratory, and, work, with, meitner, continuing, with, their, research, in, september, 1917, he, was, one, of, three, officers, disguised, in, austrian, uniforms, sent, to, the, isonzo, front, in, italy, to, find, a, suitable, location, for, an, attack, utilising, newly, developed, rifled, minenwerfers, that, simultaneously, hurled, hundreds, of, containers, of, poison, gas, onto, enemy, targets, they, selected, a, site, where, the, italian, trenches, were, sheltered, in, a, deep, valley, so, that, a, gas, cloud, would, persist, the, following, battle, of, caporetto, broke, the, italian, lines, and, the, central, powers, overran, much, of, northern, italy, in, 1918, the, german, offensive, in, the, west, smashed, through, the, allies, lines, after, a, massive, release, of, gas, from, their, mortars, that, summer, hahn, was, accidentally, poisoned, by, phosgene, while, testing, a, new, model, gas, mask, at, the, end, of, the, war, he, was, in, the, field, in, mufti, on, a, secret, mission, to, test, a, pot, that, heated, and, released, a, cloud, of, arsenicals, in, 1913, chemists, frederick, soddy, and, kasimir, fajans, independently, observed, that, alpha, decay, caused, atoms, to, shift, down, two, places, on, the, periodic, table, while, the, loss, of, two, beta, particles, restored, it, to, its, original, position, under, the, resulting, reorganisation, of, the, periodic, table, radium, was, placed, in, group, ii, actinium, in, group, iii, thorium, in, group, iv, and, uranium, in, group, vi, this, left, a, gap, between, thorium, and, uranium, soddy, predicted, that, this, unknown, element, which, he, referred, to, after, dmitri, mendeleev, as, ekatantalium, would, be, an, alpha, emitter, with, chemical, properties, similar, to, tantalium, it, was, not, long, before, fajans, and, oswald, helmuth, g, hring, discovered, it, as, a, decay, product, of, a, beta, emitting, product, of, thorium, based, on, the, radioactive, displacement, law, of, fajans, and, soddy, this, was, an, isotope, of, the, missing, element, which, they, named, brevium, after, its, short, half, life, however, it, was, a, beta, emitter, and, therefore, could, not, be, the, mother, isotope, of, actinium, this, had, to, be, another, isotope, of, the, same, element, hahn, and, meitner, set, out, to, find, the, missing, mother, isotope, they, developed, a, new, technique, for, separating, the, tantalum, group, from, pitchblende, which, they, hoped, would, speed, the, isolation, of, the, new, isotope, the, work, was, interrupted, by, the, first, world, war, meitner, became, an, x, ray, nurse, working, in, austrian, army, hospitals, but, she, returned, to, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, in, october, 1916, hahn, joined, the, new, gas, command, unit, at, imperial, headquarters, in, berlin, in, december, 1916, after, travelling, between, the, western, and, eastern, front, berlin, and, leverkusen, between, the, summer, of, 1914, and, late, 1916, most, of, the, students, laboratory, assistants, and, technicians, had, been, called, up, so, hahn, who, was, stationed, in, berlin, between, january, and, september, 1917, and, meitner, had, to, do, everything, themselves, by, december, 1917, she, was, able, to, isolate, the, substance, and, after, further, work, were, able, to, prove, that, it, was, indeed, the, missing, isotope, meitner, submitted, her, and, hahn, s, findings, for, publication, in, march, 1918, to, the, scientific, paper, physikalischen, zeitschrift, under, the, title, die, muttersubstanz, des, actiniums, ein, neues, radioaktives, element, von, langer, lebensdauer, although, fajans, and, g, hring, had, been, the, first, to, discover, the, element, custom, required, that, an, element, was, represented, by, its, longest, lived, and, most, abundant, isotope, and, brevium, did, not, seem, appropriate, fajans, agreed, to, meitner, and, hahn, naming, the, element, protoactinmium, and, assigning, it, the, chemical, symbol, pa, in, june, 1918, soddy, and, john, cranston, announced, that, they, had, extracted, a, sample, of, the, isotope, but, unlike, hahn, and, meitner, were, unable, to, describe, its, characteristics, they, acknowledged, hahn, s, and, meitner, s, priority, and, agreed, to, the, name, the, connection, to, uranium, remained, a, mystery, as, neither, of, the, known, isotopes, of, uranium, decayed, into, protactinium, it, remained, unsolved, until, the, mother, isotope, uranium, 235, was, discovered, in, 1929, for, their, discovery, hahn, and, meitner, were, repeatedly, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, the, 1920s, by, several, scientists, among, them, max, planck, heinrich, goldschmidt, and, fajans, himself, in, 1949, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, named, the, new, element, definitively, protactinium, and, confirmed, hahn, and, meitner, as, discoverers, with, the, discovery, of, protactinium, most, of, the, decay, chains, of, uranium, had, been, mapped, when, hahn, returned, to, his, work, after, the, war, he, looked, back, over, his, 1914, results, and, considered, some, anomalies, that, had, been, dismissed, or, overlooked, he, dissolved, uranium, salts, in, a, hydrofluoric, acid, solution, with, tantalic, acid, first, the, tantalum, in, the, ore, was, precipitated, then, the, protactinium, in, addition, to, the, uranium, x1, thorium, 234, and, uranium, x2, protactinium, 234, hahn, detected, traces, of, a, radioactive, substance, with, a, half, life, of, between, 6, and, 7, hours, there, was, one, isotope, known, to, have, a, half, life, of, 6, 2, hours, mesothorium, ii, actinium, 228, this, was, not, in, any, probable, decay, chain, but, it, could, have, been, contamination, as, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, had, experimented, with, it, hahn, and, meitner, demonstrated, in, 1919, that, when, actinium, is, treated, with, hydrofluoric, acid, it, remains, in, the, insoluble, residue, since, mesothorium, ii, was, an, isotope, of, actinium, the, substance, was, not, mesothorium, ii, it, was, protactinium, hahn, was, now, confident, enough, that, he, had, found, something, that, he, named, his, new, isotope, uranium, z, and, in, february, 1921, he, published, the, first, report, on, his, discovery, hahn, determined, that, uranium, z, had, a, half, life, of, around, 6, 7, hours, with, a, two, per, cent, margin, of, error, and, that, when, uranium, x1, decayed, it, became, uranium, x2, about, 99, 75, per, cent, of, the, time, and, uranium, z, around, 0, 25, per, cent, of, the, time, he, found, that, the, proportion, of, uranium, x, to, uranium, z, extracted, from, several, kilograms, of, uranyl, nitrate, remained, constant, over, time, strongly, indicating, that, uranium, x, was, the, mother, of, uranium, z, to, prove, this, hahn, obtained, a, hundred, kilograms, of, uranyl, nitrate, separating, the, uranium, x, from, it, took, weeks, he, found, that, the, half, life, of, the, parent, of, uranium, z, differed, from, the, known, 24, day, half, life, of, uranium, x1, by, no, more, than, two, or, three, days, but, was, unable, to, get, a, more, accurate, value, hahn, concluded, that, uranium, z, and, uranium, x2, were, both, the, same, isotope, of, protactinium, protactinium, 234, and, they, both, decayed, into, uranium, ii, uranium, 234, but, with, different, half, lives, uranium, z, was, the, first, example, of, nuclear, isomerism, walther, gerlach, later, remarked, that, this, was, a, discovery, that, was, not, understood, at, the, time, but, later, became, highly, significant, for, nuclear, physics, not, until, 1936, was, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, able, to, provide, a, theoretical, explanation, of, the, phenomenon, for, this, discovery, whose, full, significance, was, recognised, by, very, few, hahn, was, again, proposed, for, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, by, bernhard, naunyn, goldschmidt, and, planck, in, 1924, hahn, was, elected, to, full, membership, of, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, in, berlin, by, a, vote, of, thirty, white, balls, to, two, black, while, still, remaining, the, head, of, his, own, department, he, became, deputy, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, in, 1924, and, succeeded, alfred, stock, as, the, director, in, 1928, meitner, became, the, director, of, the, physical, radioactivity, division, while, hahn, headed, the, chemical, radioactivity, division, in, the, early, 1920s, he, created, a, new, line, of, research, using, the, emanation, method, which, he, had, recently, developed, and, the, emanation, ability, he, founded, what, became, known, as, applied, radiochemistry, for, the, researching, of, general, chemical, and, physical, chemical, questions, in, 1936, cornell, university, press, published, a, book, in, english, and, later, in, russian, titled, applied, radiochemistry, which, contained, the, lectures, given, by, hahn, when, he, was, a, visiting, professor, at, cornell, university, in, ithaca, new, york, in, 1933, this, important, publication, had, a, major, influence, on, almost, all, nuclear, chemists, and, physicists, in, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, 1966, glenn, t, seaborg, co, discoverer, of, many, transuranium, elements, wrote, about, this, book, as, follows, as, a, young, graduate, student, at, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, in, the, mid, 1930s, and, in, connection, with, our, work, with, plutonium, a, few, years, later, i, used, his, book, applied, radiochemistry, as, my, bible, this, book, was, based, on, a, series, of, lectures, which, professor, hahn, had, given, at, cornell, in, 1933, it, set, forth, the, laws, for, the, co, precipitation, of, minute, quantities, of, radioactive, materials, when, insoluble, substances, were, precipitated, from, aqueous, solutions, i, recall, reading, and, rereading, every, word, in, these, laws, of, co, precipitation, many, times, attempting, to, derive, every, possible, bit, of, guidance, for, our, work, and, perhaps, in, my, zealousness, reading, into, them, more, than, the, master, himself, had, intended, i, doubt, that, i, have, read, sections, in, any, other, book, more, carefully, or, more, frequently, than, those, in, hahn, s, applied, radiochemistry, in, fact, i, read, the, entire, volume, repeatedly, and, i, recall, that, my, chief, disappointment, with, it, was, its, length, it, was, too, short, hahn, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, nuclear, chemistry, which, emerged, from, applied, radiochemistry, fritz, strassmann, had, come, to, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, to, study, under, hahn, in, order, to, improve, his, employment, prospects, after, the, nazi, party, came, to, power, in, germany, in, 1933, strassmann, declined, a, lucrative, offer, of, employment, because, it, required, political, training, and, nazi, party, membership, later, rather, than, become, a, member, of, a, nazi, controlled, organisation, strassmann, resigned, from, the, society, of, german, chemists, when, it, became, part, of, the, nazi, german, labour, front, as, a, result, he, could, neither, work, in, the, chemical, industry, nor, receive, his, habilitation, the, prerequisite, for, an, academic, position, meitner, persuaded, hahn, to, hire, strassmann, as, an, assistant, soon, he, would, be, credited, as, a, third, collaborator, on, the, papers, they, produced, and, would, sometimes, even, be, listed, first, hahn, spent, february, to, june, 1933, in, the, united, states, and, canada, as, a, visiting, professor, at, cornell, university, he, gave, an, interview, to, the, toronto, star, weekly, in, which, he, painted, a, flattering, portrait, of, adolf, hitler, i, am, not, a, nazi, but, hitler, is, the, hope, the, powerful, hope, of, german, youth, at, least, 20, million, people, revere, him, he, began, as, a, nobody, and, you, see, what, he, has, become, in, ten, years, in, any, case, for, the, youth, for, the, nation, of, the, future, hitler, is, a, hero, a, f, hrer, a, saint, in, his, daily, life, he, is, almost, a, saint, no, alcohol, not, even, tobacco, no, meat, no, women, in, a, word, hitler, is, an, unequivocal, christ, the, april, 1933, law, for, the, restoration, of, the, professional, civil, service, banned, jews, and, communists, from, academia, meitner, was, exempt, from, its, impact, because, she, was, an, austrian, rather, than, a, german, citizen, haber, was, likewise, exempt, as, a, veteran, of, world, war, i, but, chose, to, resign, his, directorship, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, of, physical, chemistry, and, electrochemistry, in, protest, on, 30, april, 1933, but, the, directors, of, the, other, kaiser, wilhelm, institutes, even, the, jewish, ones, complied, with, the, new, law, which, applied, to, the, kws, as, a, whole, and, those, kaiser, wilhelm, institutes, with, more, than, 50, state, support, which, exempted, the, kwi, for, chemistry, hahn, therefore, did, not, have, to, fire, any, of, his, own, full, time, staff, but, as, the, interim, director, of, haber, s, institute, he, dismissed, a, quarter, of, its, staff, including, three, department, heads, gerhart, jander, was, appointed, the, new, director, of, haber, s, old, institute, and, ironically, reoriented, it, towards, chemical, warfare, research, like, most, kws, institute, directors, haber, had, accrued, a, large, discretionary, fund, it, was, his, wish, that, it, be, distributed, to, the, dismissed, staff, to, facilitate, their, emigration, but, the, rockefeller, foundation, insisted, that, the, funds, either, be, used, for, scientific, research, or, returned, hahn, brokered, a, deal, whereby, 10, per, cent, of, the, funds, would, be, allocated, to, haber, s, people, in, august, 1933, the, administrators, of, the, kws, were, alerted, that, several, boxes, of, rockefeller, foundation, funded, equipment, was, about, to, be, shipped, to, herbert, freundlich, one, of, the, department, heads, that, hahn, had, dismissed, in, england, hahn, complied, with, an, order, to, halt, the, shipment, but, when, planck, the, president, of, the, kws, since, 1930, returned, from, vacation, he, ordered, hahn, to, expedite, the, shipment, haber, died, on, 29, january, 1934, a, memorial, service, was, held, on, the, first, anniversary, of, his, death, university, professors, were, forbidden, to, attend, so, they, sent, their, wives, in, their, place, hahn, planck, and, joseph, koeth, attended, and, gave, speeches, the, aging, planck, did, not, seek, re, election, and, was, succeeded, in, 1937, as, president, by, carl, bosch, a, nobel, prize, winner, in, chemistry, and, the, chairman, of, the, board, of, ig, farben, a, company, which, had, bankrolled, the, nazi, party, since, 1932, ernst, telschow, became, secretary, of, the, kws, telschow, was, an, enthusiastic, supporter, of, the, nazis, but, was, also, loyal, to, hahn, being, one, of, his, former, students, and, hahn, welcomed, his, appointment, hahn, s, chief, assistant, otto, erbacher, became, the, kwi, for, chemistry, s, party, steward, vertrauensmann, while, hahn, was, in, north, america, his, attention, was, drawn, to, a, mica, like, mineral, from, manitoba, that, contained, rubidium, some, years, before, he, had, studied, the, radioactive, decay, of, rubidium, 87, and, had, estimated, its, half, life, at, 2, x, 10, 11, years, it, occurred, to, hahn, that, by, comparing, the, quantity, of, strontium, in, the, mineral, which, had, once, been, rubidium, with, that, of, the, remaining, rubidium, he, could, measure, the, age, of, the, mineral, assuming, that, his, original, calculation, of, the, half, life, was, reasonably, accurate, this, would, be, a, superior, dating, method, to, studying, the, decay, of, uranium, because, some, of, the, uranium, turns, into, helium, which, then, escapes, resulting, in, rocks, appearing, to, be, younger, than, they, really, were, jacob, papish, helped, hahn, obtain, several, kilograms, of, the, mineral, from, 1, 012, grams, of, the, mineral, strassmann, and, ernst, walling, extracted, 253, 4, milligrams, of, strontium, carbonate, all, of, which, was, the, strontium, 87, isotope, indicating, that, it, had, all, been, produced, from, radioactive, decay, of, rubidium, 87, the, age, of, the, mineral, had, been, estimated, at, 1, 975, million, years, from, uranium, minerals, in, the, same, deposit, which, implied, that, the, half, life, of, rubidium, 87, was, 2, 3, x, 10, 11, years, quite, close, to, hahn, s, original, calculation, rubidium, strontium, dating, became, a, widely, used, technique, for, dating, rocks, in, the, 1950s, when, mass, spectrometry, became, common, after, james, chadwick, discovered, the, neutron, in, 1932, ir, ne, curie, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, irradiated, aluminium, foil, with, alpha, particles, they, found, that, this, results, in, a, short, lived, radioactive, isotope, of, phosphorus, they, noted, that, positron, emission, continued, after, the, neutron, emissions, ceased, not, only, had, they, discovered, a, new, form, of, radioactive, decay, they, had, transmuted, an, element, into, a, hitherto, unknown, radioactive, isotope, of, another, thereby, inducing, radioactivity, where, there, had, been, none, before, radiochemistry, was, now, no, longer, confined, to, certain, heavy, elements, but, extended, to, the, entire, periodic, table, chadwick, noted, that, being, electrically, neutral, neutrons, could, penetrate, the, atomic, nucleus, more, easily, than, protons, or, alpha, particles, enrico, fermi, and, his, colleagues, in, rome, picked, up, on, this, idea, and, began, irradiating, elements, with, neutrons, the, radioactive, displacement, law, of, fajans, and, soddy, said, that, beta, decay, causes, isotopes, to, move, one, element, up, on, the, periodic, table, and, alpha, decay, causes, them, to, move, two, down, when, fermi, s, group, bombarded, uranium, atoms, with, neutrons, they, found, a, complex, mix, of, half, lives, fermi, therefore, concluded, that, the, new, elements, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 92, known, as, transuranium, elements, had, been, created, meitner, and, hahn, had, not, collaborated, for, many, years, but, meitner, was, eager, to, investigate, fermi, s, results, hahn, initially, was, not, but, he, changed, his, mind, when, aristid, von, grosse, suggested, that, what, fermi, had, found, was, an, isotope, of, protactinium, the, only, question, hahn, later, wrote, seemed, to, be, whether, fermi, had, found, isotopes, of, transuranian, elements, or, isotopes, of, the, next, lower, element, protactinium, at, that, time, lise, meitner, and, i, decided, to, repeat, fermi, s, experiments, in, order, to, find, out, whether, the, 13, minute, isotope, was, a, protactinium, isotope, or, not, it, was, a, logical, decision, having, been, the, discoverers, of, protactinium, between, 1934, and, 1938, hahn, meitner, and, strassmann, found, a, great, number, of, radioactive, transmutation, products, all, of, which, they, regarded, as, transuranic, at, that, time, the, existence, of, actinides, was, not, yet, established, and, uranium, was, wrongly, believed, to, be, a, group, 6, element, similar, to, tungsten, it, followed, that, first, transuranic, elements, would, be, similar, to, group, 7, to, 10, elements, i, e, rhenium, and, platinoids, they, established, the, presence, of, multiple, isotopes, of, at, least, four, such, elements, and, mistakenly, identified, them, as, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 93, through, 96, they, were, the, first, scientists, to, measure, the, 23, minute, half, life, of, uranium, 239, and, to, establish, chemically, that, it, was, an, isotope, of, uranium, but, were, unable, to, continue, this, work, to, its, logical, conclusion, and, identify, the, real, element, 93, they, identified, ten, different, half, lives, with, varying, degrees, of, certainty, to, account, for, them, meitner, had, to, hypothesise, a, new, class, of, reaction, and, the, alpha, decay, of, uranium, neither, of, which, had, ever, been, reported, before, and, for, which, physical, evidence, was, lacking, hahn, and, strassmann, refined, their, chemical, procedures, while, meitner, devised, new, experiments, to, shine, more, light, on, the, reaction, processes, in, may, 1937, they, issued, parallel, reports, one, in, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, with, meitner, as, the, principal, author, and, one, in, chemische, berichte, with, hahn, as, the, principal, author, hahn, concluded, his, by, stating, emphatically, vor, allem, steht, ihre, chemische, verschiedenheit, von, allen, bisher, bekannten, elementen, au, erhalb, jeder, diskussion, above, all, their, chemical, distinction, from, all, previously, known, elements, needs, no, further, discussion, meitner, was, increasingly, uncertain, she, considered, the, possibility, that, the, reactions, were, from, different, isotopes, of, uranium, three, were, known, uranium, 238, uranium, 235, and, uranium, 234, however, when, she, calculated, the, neutron, cross, section, it, was, too, large, to, be, anything, other, than, the, most, abundant, isotope, uranium, 238, she, concluded, that, it, must, be, another, case, of, the, nuclear, isomerism, that, hahn, had, discovered, in, protactinium, she, therefore, ended, her, report, on, a, very, different, note, to, hahn, reporting, that, the, process, must, be, neutron, capture, by, uranium, 238, which, leads, to, three, isomeric, nuclei, of, uranium, 239, this, result, is, very, difficult, to, reconcile, with, current, concepts, of, the, nucleus, with, the, anschluss, germany, s, unification, with, austria, on, 12, march, 1938, meitner, lost, her, austrian, citizenship, and, fled, to, sweden, she, carried, only, a, little, money, but, before, she, left, hahn, gave, her, a, diamond, ring, he, had, inherited, from, his, mother, meitner, continued, to, correspond, with, hahn, by, mail, in, late, 1938, hahn, and, strassmann, found, evidence, of, isotopes, of, an, alkaline, earth, metal, in, their, sample, finding, a, group, 2, alkaline, earth, metal, was, problematic, because, it, did, not, logically, fit, with, the, other, elements, found, thus, far, hahn, initially, suspected, it, to, be, radium, produced, by, splitting, off, two, alpha, particles, from, the, uranium, nucleus, but, chipping, off, two, alpha, particles, via, this, process, was, unlikely, the, idea, of, turning, uranium, into, barium, by, removing, around, 100, nucleons, was, seen, as, preposterous, during, a, visit, to, copenhagen, on, 10, november, hahn, discussed, these, results, with, niels, bohr, lise, meitner, and, otto, robert, frisch, further, refinements, of, the, technique, leading, to, the, decisive, experiment, on, 16, 17, december, 1938, produced, puzzling, results, the, three, isotopes, consistently, behaved, not, as, radium, but, as, barium, hahn, who, did, not, inform, the, physicists, in, his, institute, described, the, results, exclusively, in, a, letter, to, meitner, on, 19, december, we, are, more, and, more, coming, to, the, awful, conclusion, that, our, ra, isotopes, behave, not, like, ra, but, like, ba, perhaps, you, can, come, up, with, some, fantastic, explanation, we, ourselves, realize, that, it, can, t, actually, burst, apart, into, ba, now, we, want, to, test, whether, the, ac, isotopes, derived, from, the, ra, behave, not, like, ac, but, like, la, in, her, reply, meitner, concurred, at, the, moment, the, interpretation, of, such, a, thoroughgoing, breakup, seems, very, difficult, to, me, but, in, nuclear, physics, we, have, experienced, so, many, surprises, that, one, cannot, unconditionally, say, it, is, impossible, on, 22, december, 1938, hahn, sent, a, manuscript, to, naturwissenschaften, reporting, their, radiochemical, results, which, were, published, on, 6, january, 1939, on, 27, december, hahn, telephoned, the, editor, of, naturwissenschaften, and, requested, an, addition, to, the, article, speculating, that, some, platinum, group, elements, previously, observed, in, irradiated, uranium, which, were, originally, interpreted, as, transuranium, elements, could, in, fact, be, technetium, then, called, masurium, mistakenly, believing, that, the, atomic, masses, had, to, add, up, rather, than, the, atomic, numbers, by, january, 1939, he, was, sufficiently, convinced, of, the, formation, of, light, elements, that, he, published, a, new, revision, of, the, article, retracting, former, claims, of, observing, transuranic, elements, and, neighbours, of, uranium, as, a, chemist, hahn, was, reluctant, to, propose, a, revolutionary, discovery, in, physics, but, meitner, and, frisch, worked, out, a, theoretical, interpretation, of, nuclear, fission, a, term, appropriated, by, frisch, from, biology, in, january, and, february, they, published, two, articles, discussing, and, experimentally, confirming, their, theory, in, their, second, publication, on, nuclear, fission, hahn, and, strassmann, used, the, term, uranspaltung, uranium, fission, for, the, first, time, and, predicted, the, existence, and, liberation, of, additional, neutrons, during, the, fission, process, opening, up, the, possibility, of, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, this, was, proved, to, be, the, case, by, fr, d, ric, joliot, and, his, team, in, march, 1939, edwin, mcmillan, and, philip, abelson, used, the, cyclotron, at, the, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, to, bombard, uranium, with, neutrons, were, able, to, identify, an, isotope, with, a, 23, minute, half, life, that, was, the, daughter, of, uranium, 239, and, therefore, the, real, element, 93, which, they, named, neptunium, there, goes, a, nobel, prize, hahn, remarked, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, kurt, starke, independently, produced, element, 93, using, only, the, weak, neutron, sources, available, there, hahn, and, strassmann, then, began, researching, its, chemical, properties, they, knew, that, it, should, decay, into, the, real, element, 94, which, according, to, the, latest, version, of, the, liquid, drop, model, of, the, nucleus, propounded, by, bohr, and, john, archibald, wheeler, would, be, even, more, fissile, than, uranium, 235, but, were, unable, to, detect, its, radioactive, decay, they, concluded, that, it, must, have, an, extremely, long, half, life, perhaps, millions, of, years, part, of, the, problem, was, that, they, still, believed, that, element, 94, was, a, platinoid, which, confounded, their, attempts, at, chemical, separation, on, 24, april, 1939, paul, harteck, and, his, assistant, wilhelm, groth, had, written, to, the, armed, forces, high, command, okw, alerting, it, to, the, possibility, of, the, development, of, an, atomic, bomb, in, response, the, army, weapons, branch, hwa, had, established, a, physics, section, under, nuclear, physicist, kurt, diebner, after, world, war, ii, broke, out, on, 1, september, 1939, the, hwa, moved, to, control, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, from, then, on, hahn, participated, in, a, ceaseless, series, of, meetings, related, to, the, project, after, the, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, peter, debye, left, for, the, united, states, in, 1940, and, never, returned, diebner, was, installed, as, its, director, hahn, reported, to, the, hwa, on, the, progress, of, his, research, together, with, his, assistants, hans, joachim, born, siegfried, fl, gge, hans, g, tte, walter, seelmann, eggebert, and, strassmann, he, catalogued, about, one, hundred, fission, product, isotopes, they, also, investigated, means, of, isotope, separation, the, chemistry, of, element, 93, and, methods, for, purifying, uranium, oxides, and, salts, on, the, night, of, 15, february, 1944, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, building, was, struck, by, a, bomb, hahn, s, office, was, destroyed, along, with, his, correspondence, with, rutherford, and, other, researchers, and, many, of, his, personal, possessions, the, office, was, the, intended, target, of, the, raid, which, had, been, ordered, by, brigadier, general, leslie, groves, the, director, of, the, manhattan, project, in, the, hope, of, disrupting, the, german, uranium, project, albert, speer, the, reich, minister, of, armaments, and, war, production, arranged, for, the, institute, to, move, to, tailfingen, in, southern, germany, all, work, in, berlin, ceased, by, july, hahn, and, his, family, moved, to, the, house, of, a, textile, manufacturer, there, life, became, precarious, for, those, married, to, jewish, women, one, was, philipp, hoernes, a, chemist, working, for, auergesellschaft, the, firm, that, mined, the, uranium, ore, used, by, the, project, after, the, firm, let, him, go, in, 1944, hoernes, faced, being, conscripted, for, forced, labour, at, the, age, of, 60, it, was, doubtful, that, he, would, survive, hahn, and, nikolaus, riehl, arranged, for, hoernes, to, work, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, claiming, that, his, work, was, essential, to, the, uranium, project, and, that, uranium, was, highly, toxic, making, it, hard, to, find, people, to, work, with, it, hahn, was, aware, that, uranium, ore, was, fairly, safe, in, the, laboratory, although, not, so, much, for, the, 2, 000, female, slave, labourers, from, sachsenhausen, concentration, camp, who, mined, it, in, oranienburg, another, physicist, with, a, jewish, wife, was, heinrich, rausch, von, traubenberg, hahn, certified, that, his, work, was, important, to, the, war, effort, and, that, his, wife, maria, who, had, a, doctorate, in, physics, was, required, as, his, assistant, after, he, died, on, 19, september, 1944, maria, faced, being, sent, to, a, concentration, camp, hahn, mounted, a, lobbying, campaign, to, get, her, released, but, to, no, avail, and, she, was, sent, to, the, theresienstadt, ghetto, in, january, 1945, she, survived, the, war, and, was, reunited, with, her, daughters, in, england, after, the, war, on, 25, april, 1945, an, armoured, task, force, from, the, british, american, alsos, mission, arrived, in, tailfingen, and, surrounded, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, hahn, was, informed, that, he, was, under, arrest, when, asked, about, reports, related, to, his, secret, work, on, uranium, hahn, replied, i, have, them, all, here, and, handed, over, 150, reports, he, was, taken, to, hechingen, where, he, joined, erich, bagge, horst, korsching, max, von, laue, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, and, karl, wirtz, they, were, then, taken, to, a, dilapidated, ch, teau, in, versailles, where, they, heard, about, the, signing, of, the, german, instrument, of, surrender, at, reims, on, 7, may, over, the, following, days, they, were, joined, by, kurt, diebner, walther, gerlach, paul, harteck, and, werner, heisenberg, all, were, physicists, except, hahn, and, harteck, who, were, chemists, and, all, had, worked, on, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, except, von, laue, although, he, was, well, aware, of, it, they, were, relocated, to, the, ch, teau, de, facqueval, in, modave, belgium, where, hahn, used, the, time, to, work, on, his, memoirs, and, then, on, 3, july, were, flown, to, england, they, arrived, at, farm, hall, godmanchester, near, cambridge, on, 3, july, unbeknown, to, them, their, every, conversation, indoors, and, out, was, recorded, from, hidden, microphones, they, were, given, british, newspapers, which, hahn, was, able, to, read, he, was, greatly, disturbed, by, their, reports, of, the, potsdam, conference, where, german, territory, was, ceded, to, poland, and, the, ussr, in, august, 1945, the, german, scientists, were, informed, of, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, up, to, this, point, the, scientists, except, harteck, were, completely, certain, that, their, project, was, further, advanced, than, any, in, other, countries, and, the, alsos, mission, s, chief, scientist, samuel, goudsmit, did, nothing, to, correct, this, impression, now, the, reason, for, their, incarceration, in, farm, hall, suddenly, became, apparent, as, they, recovered, from, the, shock, of, the, announcement, they, began, to, rationalise, what, had, happened, hahn, noted, that, he, was, glad, that, they, had, not, succeeded, and, von, weizs, cker, suggested, that, they, should, claim, that, they, had, not, wanted, to, they, drafted, a, memorandum, on, the, project, noting, that, fission, was, discovered, by, hahn, and, strassmann, the, revelation, that, nagasaki, had, been, destroyed, by, a, plutonium, bomb, came, as, another, shock, as, it, meant, that, the, allies, had, not, only, been, able, to, successfully, conduct, uranium, enrichment, but, had, mastered, nuclear, reactor, technology, as, well, the, memorandum, became, the, first, draft, of, a, postwar, apologia, the, idea, that, germany, had, lost, the, war, because, its, scientists, were, morally, superior, was, as, outrageous, as, it, was, unbelievable, but, struck, a, chord, in, postwar, german, academia, it, infuriated, goudsmit, whose, parents, had, been, murdered, in, auschwitz, on, 3, january, 1946, exactly, six, months, after, they, had, arrived, at, farm, hall, the, group, was, allowed, to, return, to, germany, hahn, heisenberg, von, laue, and, von, weizs, cker, were, brought, to, g, ttingen, which, was, controlled, by, the, british, occupation, authorities, on, 16, november, 1945, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, announced, that, hahn, had, been, awarded, the, 1944, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, discovery, of, the, fission, of, heavy, atomic, nuclei, hahn, was, still, at, farm, hall, when, the, announcement, was, made, thus, his, whereabouts, were, a, secret, and, it, was, impossible, for, the, nobel, committee, to, send, him, a, congratulatory, telegram, instead, he, learned, about, his, award, on, 18, november, through, the, daily, telegraph, his, fellow, interned, scientists, celebrated, his, award, by, giving, speeches, making, jokes, and, composing, songs, hahn, had, been, nominated, for, the, chemistry, and, the, physics, nobel, prizes, many, times, even, before, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, several, more, followed, for, the, discovery, of, fission, the, nobel, prize, nominations, were, vetted, by, committees, of, five, one, for, each, award, although, hahn, and, meitner, received, nominations, for, physics, radioactivity, and, radioactive, elements, had, traditionally, been, seen, as, the, domain, of, chemistry, and, so, the, nobel, committee, for, chemistry, evaluated, the, nominations, the, committee, received, reports, from, theodor, svedberg, and, arne, westgren, these, chemists, were, impressed, by, hahn, s, work, but, felt, that, of, meitner, and, frisch, was, not, extraordinary, and, did, not, understand, why, the, physics, community, regarded, their, work, as, seminal, as, for, strassmann, although, his, name, was, on, the, papers, there, was, a, long, standing, policy, of, conferring, awards, on, the, most, senior, scientist, in, a, collaboration, the, committee, therefore, recommended, that, hahn, alone, be, given, the, chemistry, prize, under, nazi, rule, germans, had, been, forbidden, to, accept, nobel, prizes, after, the, nobel, peace, prize, had, been, awarded, to, carl, von, ossietzky, in, 1936, the, nobel, committee, for, chemistry, s, recommendation, was, therefore, rejected, by, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1944, which, also, decided, to, defer, the, award, for, one, year, when, the, academy, reconsidered, the, award, in, september, 1945, the, war, was, over, and, thus, the, german, boycott, had, ended, also, the, chemistry, committee, had, now, become, more, cautious, as, it, was, apparent, that, much, research, had, taken, place, in, the, united, states, in, secret, and, suggested, deferring, for, another, year, but, the, academy, was, swayed, by, g, ran, liljestrand, who, argued, that, it, was, important, for, the, academy, to, assert, its, independence, from, the, allies, of, world, war, ii, and, award, the, prize, to, a, german, as, it, had, done, after, world, war, i, when, it, had, awarded, it, to, fritz, haber, hahn, therefore, became, the, sole, recipient, of, the, 1944, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, the, invitation, to, attend, the, nobel, festivities, was, transmitted, via, the, british, embassy, in, stockholm, on, 4, december, hahn, was, persuaded, by, two, of, his, alsos, captors, american, lieutenant, colonel, horace, k, calvert, and, british, lieutenant, commander, eric, welsh, to, write, a, letter, to, the, nobel, committee, accepting, the, prize, but, stating, that, he, would, not, be, able, to, attend, the, award, ceremony, on, 10, december, since, his, captors, would, not, allow, him, to, leave, farm, hall, when, hahn, protested, welsh, reminded, him, that, germany, had, lost, the, war, under, the, nobel, foundation, statutes, hahn, had, six, months, to, deliver, the, nobel, prize, lecture, and, until, 1, october, 1946, to, cash, the, 150, 000, swedish, krona, cheque, hahn, was, repatriated, from, farm, hall, on, 3, january, 1946, but, it, soon, became, apparent, that, difficulties, obtaining, permission, to, travel, from, the, british, government, meant, that, he, would, be, unable, to, travel, to, sweden, before, december, 1946, accordingly, the, academy, of, sciences, and, the, nobel, foundation, obtained, an, extension, from, the, swedish, government, hahn, attended, the, year, after, he, was, awarded, the, prize, on, 10, december, 1946, the, anniversary, of, the, death, of, alfred, nobel, king, gustav, v, of, sweden, presented, him, with, his, nobel, prize, medal, and, diploma, hahn, gave, 10, 000, krona, of, his, prize, to, strassmann, who, refused, to, use, it, the, suicide, of, albert, v, gler, on, 14, april, 1945, left, the, kws, without, a, president, the, british, chemist, bertie, blount, was, placed, in, charge, of, its, affairs, while, the, allies, decided, what, to, do, with, it, and, he, decided, to, install, max, planck, as, an, interim, president, now, aged, 87, planck, was, in, the, small, town, of, rog, tz, in, an, area, that, the, americans, were, preparing, to, hand, over, to, the, soviet, union, the, dutch, astronomer, gerard, kuiper, from, the, alsos, mission, fetched, planck, in, a, jeep, and, brought, him, to, g, ttingen, on, 16, may, planck, wrote, to, hahn, who, was, still, in, captivity, in, england, on, 25, july, and, informed, hahn, that, the, directors, of, the, kws, had, voted, to, make, him, the, next, president, and, asked, if, he, would, accept, the, position, hahn, did, not, receive, the, letter, until, september, and, did, not, think, he, was, a, good, choice, as, he, regarded, himself, as, a, poor, negotiator, but, his, colleagues, persuaded, him, to, accept, after, his, return, to, germany, he, assumed, the, office, on, 1, april, 1946, allied, control, council, law, no, 25, on, the, control, of, scientific, research, dated, 29, april, 1946, restricted, german, scientists, to, conducting, basic, research, only, and, on, 11, july, the, allied, control, council, dissolved, the, kws, on, the, insistence, of, the, americans, who, considered, that, it, had, been, too, close, to, the, national, socialist, regime, and, was, a, threat, to, world, peace, however, the, british, who, had, voted, against, the, dissolution, were, more, sympathetic, and, offered, to, let, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, continue, in, the, british, zone, on, one, condition, that, the, name, be, changed, hahn, and, heisenberg, were, distraught, at, this, prospect, to, them, it, was, an, international, brand, that, represented, political, independence, and, scientific, research, of, the, highest, order, hahn, noted, that, it, had, been, suggested, that, the, name, be, changed, during, the, weimar, republic, but, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, had, been, persuaded, not, to, to, hahn, the, name, represented, the, good, old, days, of, the, german, empire, however, authoritarian, and, undemocratic, it, was, before, the, hated, weimar, republic, heisenberg, asked, niels, bohr, for, support, but, bohr, recommended, that, the, name, be, changed, lise, meitner, wrote, to, hahn, explaining, that, outside, of, germany, it, is, considered, so, obvious, that, the, tradition, from, the, period, of, kaiser, wilhelm, has, been, disastrous, and, that, changing, the, name, of, the, kws, is, desirable, that, no, one, understands, the, resistance, against, it, for, the, idea, that, the, germans, are, the, chosen, people, and, have, the, right, to, use, any, and, all, means, to, subordinate, the, inferior, people, has, been, expressed, over, and, over, again, by, historians, philosophers, and, politicians, and, finally, the, nazis, tried, to, translate, it, into, fact, the, best, people, among, the, english, and, americans, wish, that, the, best, germans, would, understand, that, there, should, be, a, definitive, break, with, this, tradition, which, has, brought, the, entire, world, and, germany, itself, the, greatest, misfortune, and, as, a, small, sign, of, german, understanding, the, name, of, the, kws, should, be, changed, what, s, in, a, name, if, it, is, a, matter, of, the, existence, of, germany, and, thereby, europe, in, september, 1946, a, new, max, planck, society, was, established, at, bad, driburg, in, the, british, zone, on, 26, february, 1948, after, the, us, and, british, zones, were, fused, into, bizonia, it, was, dissolved, to, make, way, for, the, max, planck, society, with, hahn, as, the, founding, president, it, took, over, the, 29, institutes, of, the, former, kaiser, wilhelm, society, that, were, located, in, the, british, and, american, zones, when, the, federal, republic, of, germany, or, west, germany, was, formed, in, 1949, the, five, institutes, located, in, the, french, zone, joined, them, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, now, under, strassmann, built, and, renovated, new, accommodation, in, mainz, but, work, proceeded, slowly, and, it, did, not, relocate, from, tailfingen, until, 1949, hahn, s, insistence, on, retaining, ernst, telschow, as, the, general, secretary, nearly, caused, a, rebellion, against, his, presidency, in, his, efforts, to, rebuild, german, science, hahn, was, generous, in, issuing, persilschein, whitewash, certificates, writing, one, for, gottfried, von, droste, who, had, joined, the, sturmabteilung, sa, in, 1933, and, the, nsdap, in, 1937, and, wore, his, sa, uniform, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, and, for, heinrich, h, rlein, and, fritz, ter, meer, from, ig, farben, hahn, served, as, president, of, the, max, planck, society, until, 1960, and, succeeded, in, regaining, the, renown, that, had, once, been, enjoyed, by, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, new, institutes, were, founded, and, old, ones, expanded, the, budget, rose, from, 12, million, deutsche, marks, in, 1949, to, 47, million, in, 1960, and, the, workforce, grew, from, 1, 400, to, nearly, 3, 000, after, the, second, world, war, hahn, came, out, strongly, against, the, use, of, nuclear, energy, for, military, purposes, he, saw, the, application, of, his, scientific, discoveries, to, such, ends, as, a, misuse, or, even, a, crime, lawrence, badash, wrote, his, wartime, recognition, of, the, perversion, of, science, for, the, construction, of, weapons, and, his, postwar, activity, in, planning, the, direction, of, his, country, s, scientific, endeavours, now, inclined, him, increasingly, toward, being, a, spokesman, for, social, responsibility, in, early, 1954, he, wrote, the, article, cobalt, 60, danger, or, blessing, for, mankind, about, the, misuse, of, atomic, energy, which, was, widely, reprinted, and, transmitted, in, the, radio, in, germany, norway, austria, and, denmark, and, in, an, english, version, worldwide, via, the, bbc, the, international, reaction, was, encouraging, the, following, year, he, initiated, and, organized, the, mainau, declaration, of, 1955, in, which, he, and, a, number, of, international, nobel, prize, winners, called, attention, to, the, dangers, of, atomic, weapons, and, warned, the, nations, of, the, world, urgently, against, the, use, of, force, as, a, final, resort, and, which, was, issued, a, week, after, the, similar, russell, einstein, manifesto, in, 1956, hahn, repeated, his, appeal, with, the, signature, of, 52, of, his, nobel, colleagues, from, all, parts, of, the, world, hahn, was, also, instrumental, in, and, one, of, the, authors, of, the, g, ttingen, manifesto, of, 13, april, 1957, in, which, together, with, 17, leading, german, atomic, scientists, he, protested, against, a, proposed, nuclear, arming, of, the, west, german, armed, forces, bundeswehr, this, resulted, in, hahn, receiving, an, invitation, to, meet, with, the, chancellor, of, germany, konrad, adenauer, and, other, senior, officials, including, the, defense, minister, franz, josef, strauss, and, generals, hans, speidel, and, adolf, heusinger, who, both, had, been, generals, in, the, nazi, era, the, two, generals, argued, that, the, bundeswehr, needed, nuclear, weapons, and, adenauer, accepted, their, advice, a, communique, was, drafted, that, said, that, the, federal, republic, did, not, manufacture, nuclear, weapons, and, would, not, ask, its, scientists, to, do, so, instead, the, german, forces, were, equipped, with, us, nuclear, weapons, on, 13, november, 1957, in, the, konzerthaus, concert, hall, in, vienna, hahn, warned, of, the, dangers, of, a, and, h, bomb, experiments, and, declared, that, today, war, is, no, means, of, politics, anymore, it, will, only, destroy, all, countries, in, the, world, his, highly, acclaimed, speech, was, transmitted, internationally, by, the, austrian, radio, sterreichischer, rundfunk, r, on, 28, december, 1957, hahn, repeated, his, appeal, in, an, english, translation, for, the, bulgarian, radio, in, sofia, which, was, broadcast, in, all, warsaw, pact, states, in, 1959, hahn, co, founded, in, berlin, the, federation, of, german, scientists, vdw, a, non, governmental, organization, which, has, been, committed, to, the, ideal, of, responsible, science, the, members, of, the, federation, feel, committed, to, taking, into, consideration, the, possible, military, political, and, economical, implications, and, possibilities, of, atomic, misuse, when, carrying, out, their, scientific, research, and, teaching, with, the, results, of, its, interdisciplinary, work, the, vdw, not, only, addresses, the, general, public, but, also, the, decision, makers, at, all, levels, of, politics, and, society, right, up, to, his, death, otto, hahn, never, tired, of, warning, urgently, of, the, dangers, of, the, nuclear, arms, race, between, the, great, powers, and, of, the, radioactive, contamination, of, the, planet, the, historian, lawrence, badash, wrote, the, important, thing, is, not, that, scientists, may, disagree, on, where, their, responsibility, to, society, lies, but, that, they, are, conscious, that, a, responsibility, exists, are, vocal, about, it, and, when, they, speak, out, they, expect, to, affect, policy, otto, hahn, it, would, seem, was, even, more, than, just, an, example, of, this, twentieth, century, conceptual, evolution, he, was, a, leader, in, the, process, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a, world, constituent, assembly, convened, to, draft, and, adopt, a, constitution, for, the, federation, of, earth, hahn, was, shot, in, the, back, by, a, disgruntled, inventor, in, october, 1951, injured, in, a, motor, vehicle, accident, in, 1952, and, had, a, minor, heart, attack, in, 1953, in, 1962, he, published, a, book, vom, radiothor, zur, uranspaltung, from, the, radiothor, to, uranium, fission, it, was, released, in, english, in, 1966, with, the, title, otto, hahn, a, scientific, autobiography, with, an, introduction, by, glenn, seaborg, the, success, of, this, book, may, have, prompted, him, to, write, another, fuller, autobiography, otto, hahn, mein, leben, but, before, it, could, be, published, he, fractured, one, of, the, vertebrae, in, his, neck, while, getting, out, of, a, car, he, gradually, became, weaker, and, died, in, g, ttingen, on, 28, july, 1968, his, wife, edith, survived, him, by, only, a, fortnight, he, was, buried, in, the, stadtfriedhof, in, g, ttingen, the, day, after, his, death, the, max, planck, society, published, the, following, obituary, notice, in, all, the, major, newspapers, in, germany, austria, and, switzerland, on, 28, july, in, his, 90th, year, our, honorary, president, otto, hahn, passed, away, his, name, will, be, recorded, in, the, history, of, humanity, as, the, founder, of, the, atomic, age, in, him, germany, and, the, world, have, lost, a, scholar, who, was, distinguished, in, equal, measure, by, his, integrity, and, personal, humility, the, max, planck, society, mourns, its, founder, who, continued, the, tasks, and, traditions, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, after, the, war, and, mourns, also, a, good, and, much, loved, human, being, who, will, live, in, the, memories, of, all, who, had, the, chance, to, meet, him, his, work, will, continue, we, remember, him, with, deep, gratitude, and, admiration, fritz, strassmann, wrote, the, number, of, those, who, had, been, able, to, be, near, otto, hahn, is, small, his, behaviour, was, completely, natural, for, him, but, for, the, next, generations, he, will, serve, as, a, model, regardless, of, whether, one, admires, in, the, attitude, of, otto, hahn, his, humane, and, scientific, sense, of, responsibility, or, his, personal, courage, otto, robert, frisch, recalled, hahn, remained, modest, and, informal, all, his, life, his, disarming, frankness, unfailing, kindness, good, common, sense, and, impish, humour, will, be, remembered, by, his, many, friends, all, over, the, world, the, royal, society, in, london, wrote, in, an, obituary, it, was, remarkable, how, after, the, war, this, rather, unassuming, scientist, who, had, spent, a, lifetime, in, the, laboratory, became, an, effective, administrator, and, an, important, public, figure, in, germany, hahn, famous, as, the, discoverer, of, nuclear, fission, was, respected, and, trusted, for, his, human, qualities, simplicity, of, manner, transparent, honesty, common, sense, and, loyalty, during, his, lifetime, hahn, was, awarded, orders, medals, scientific, prizes, and, fellowships, of, academies, societies, and, institutions, from, all, over, the, world, at, the, end, of, 1999, the, german, news, magazine, focus, published, an, inquiry, of, 500, leading, natural, scientists, engineers, and, physicians, about, the, most, important, scientists, of, the, 20th, century, in, this, poll, hahn, was, elected, third, with, 81, points, after, the, theoretical, physicists, albert, einstein, and, max, planck, and, thus, the,
