asan, ibn, al, haytham, latinized, as, alhazen, l, h, z, n, full, name, ab, al, al, asan, ibn, al, asan, ibn, al, haytham, c, 965, c, 1040, was, a, medieval, mathematician, astronomer, and, physicist, of, the, islamic, golden, age, from, present, day, iraq, referred, to, as, the, father, of, modern, optics, he, made, significant, contributions, to, the, principles, of, optics, and, visual, perception, in, particular, his, most, influential, work, is, titled, kit, b, al, man, ir, arabic, book, of, optics, written, during, 1011, 1021, which, survived, in, a, latin, edition, the, works, of, alhazen, were, frequently, cited, during, the, scientific, revolution, by, isaac, newton, johannes, kepler, christiaan, huygens, and, galileo, galilei, ibn, al, haytham, was, the, first, to, correctly, explain, the, theory, of, vision, and, to, argue, that, vision, occurs, in, the, brain, pointing, to, observations, that, it, is, subjective, and, affected, by, personal, experience, he, also, stated, the, principle, of, least, time, for, refraction, which, would, later, become, fermat, s, principle, he, made, major, contributions, to, catoptrics, and, dioptrics, by, studying, reflection, refraction, and, nature, of, images, formed, by, light, rays, ibn, al, haytham, was, an, early, proponent, of, the, concept, that, a, hypothesis, must, be, supported, by, experiments, based, on, confirmable, procedures, or, mathematical, reasoning, an, early, pioneer, in, the, scientific, method, five, centuries, before, renaissance, scientists, he, is, sometimes, described, as, the, world, s, first, true, scientist, he, was, also, a, polymath, writing, on, philosophy, theology, and, medicine, born, in, basra, he, spent, most, of, his, productive, period, in, the, fatimid, capital, of, cairo, and, earned, his, living, authoring, various, treatises, and, tutoring, members, of, the, nobilities, ibn, al, haytham, is, sometimes, given, the, byname, al, ba, r, after, his, birthplace, or, al, mi, r, the, egyptian, al, haytham, was, dubbed, the, second, ptolemy, by, abu, l, hasan, bayhaqi, and, the, physicist, by, john, peckham, ibn, al, haytham, paved, the, way, for, the, modern, science, of, physical, optics, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, was, born, c, 965, to, a, family, of, arab, or, persian, origin, in, basra, iraq, which, was, at, the, time, part, of, the, buyid, emirate, his, initial, influences, were, in, the, study, of, religion, and, service, to, the, community, at, the, time, society, had, a, number, of, conflicting, views, of, religion, that, he, ultimately, sought, to, step, aside, from, religion, this, led, to, him, delving, into, the, study, of, mathematics, and, science, he, held, a, position, with, the, title, of, vizier, in, his, native, basra, and, became, famous, for, his, knowledge, of, applied, mathematics, as, evidenced, by, his, attempt, to, regulate, the, flooding, of, the, nile, upon, his, return, to, cairo, he, was, given, an, administrative, post, after, he, proved, unable, to, fulfill, this, task, as, well, he, contracted, the, ire, of, the, caliph, al, hakim, and, is, said, to, have, been, forced, into, hiding, until, the, caliph, s, death, in, 1021, after, which, his, confiscated, possessions, were, returned, to, him, legend, has, it, that, alhazen, feigned, madness, and, was, kept, under, house, arrest, during, this, period, during, this, time, he, wrote, his, influential, book, of, optics, alhazen, continued, to, live, in, cairo, in, the, neighborhood, of, the, famous, university, of, al, azhar, and, lived, from, the, proceeds, of, his, literary, production, until, his, death, in, c, 1040, a, copy, of, apollonius, conics, written, in, ibn, al, haytham, s, own, handwriting, exists, in, aya, sofya, ms, aya, sofya, 2762, 307, fob, dated, safar, 415, a, h, note, 2, among, his, students, were, sorkhab, sohrab, a, persian, from, semnan, and, abu, al, wafa, mubashir, ibn, fatek, an, egyptian, prince, alhazen, s, most, famous, work, is, his, seven, volume, treatise, on, optics, kitab, al, manazir, book, of, optics, written, from, 1011, to, 1021, in, it, ibn, al, haytham, was, the, first, to, explain, that, vision, occurs, when, light, reflects, from, an, object, and, then, passes, to, one, s, eyes, and, to, argue, that, vision, occurs, in, the, brain, pointing, to, observations, that, it, is, subjective, and, affected, by, personal, experience, optics, was, translated, into, latin, by, an, unknown, scholar, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, or, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, this, work, enjoyed, a, great, reputation, during, the, middle, ages, the, latin, version, of, de, aspectibus, was, translated, at, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, into, italian, vernacular, under, the, title, de, li, aspecti, it, was, printed, by, friedrich, risner, in, 1572, with, the, title, opticae, thesaurus, alhazeni, arabis, libri, septem, nuncprimum, editi, eiusdem, liber, de, crepusculis, et, nubium, ascensionibus, english, treasury, of, optics, seven, books, by, the, arab, alhazen, first, edition, by, the, same, on, twilight, and, the, height, of, clouds, risner, is, also, the, author, of, the, name, variant, alhazen, before, risner, he, was, known, in, the, west, as, alhacen, works, by, alhazen, on, geometric, subjects, were, discovered, in, the, biblioth, que, nationale, in, paris, in, 1834, by, e, a, sedillot, in, all, a, mark, smith, has, accounted, for, 18, full, or, near, complete, manuscripts, and, five, fragments, which, are, preserved, in, 14, locations, including, one, in, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, and, one, in, the, library, of, bruges, two, major, theories, on, vision, prevailed, in, classical, antiquity, the, first, theory, the, emission, theory, was, supported, by, such, thinkers, as, euclid, and, ptolemy, who, believed, that, sight, worked, by, the, eye, emitting, rays, of, light, the, second, theory, the, intromission, theory, supported, by, aristotle, and, his, followers, had, physical, forms, entering, the, eye, from, an, object, previous, islamic, writers, such, as, al, kindi, had, argued, essentially, on, euclidean, galenist, or, aristotelian, lines, the, strongest, influence, on, the, book, of, optics, was, from, ptolemy, s, optics, while, the, description, of, the, anatomy, and, physiology, of, the, eye, was, based, on, galen, s, account, alhazen, s, achievement, was, to, come, up, with, a, theory, that, successfully, combined, parts, of, the, mathematical, ray, arguments, of, euclid, the, medical, tradition, of, galen, and, the, intromission, theories, of, aristotle, alhazen, s, intromission, theory, followed, al, kindi, and, broke, with, aristotle, in, asserting, that, from, each, point, of, every, colored, body, illuminated, by, any, light, issue, light, and, color, along, every, straight, line, that, can, be, drawn, from, that, point, this, left, him, with, the, problem, of, explaining, how, a, coherent, image, was, formed, from, many, independent, sources, of, radiation, in, particular, every, point, of, an, object, would, send, rays, to, every, point, on, the, eye, what, alhazen, needed, was, for, each, point, on, an, object, to, correspond, to, one, point, only, on, the, eye, he, attempted, to, resolve, this, by, asserting, that, the, eye, would, only, perceive, perpendicular, rays, from, the, object, for, any, one, point, on, the, eye, only, the, ray, that, reached, it, directly, without, being, refracted, by, any, other, part, of, the, eye, would, be, perceived, he, argued, using, a, physical, analogy, that, perpendicular, rays, were, stronger, than, oblique, rays, in, the, same, way, that, a, ball, thrown, directly, at, a, board, might, break, the, board, whereas, a, ball, thrown, obliquely, at, the, board, would, glance, off, perpendicular, rays, were, stronger, than, refracted, rays, and, it, was, only, perpendicular, rays, which, were, perceived, by, the, eye, as, there, was, only, one, perpendicular, ray, that, would, enter, the, eye, at, any, one, point, and, all, these, rays, would, converge, on, the, centre, of, the, eye, in, a, cone, this, allowed, him, to, resolve, the, problem, of, each, point, on, an, object, sending, many, rays, to, the, eye, if, only, the, perpendicular, ray, mattered, then, he, had, a, one, to, one, correspondence, and, the, confusion, could, be, resolved, he, later, asserted, in, book, seven, of, the, optics, that, other, rays, would, be, refracted, through, the, eye, and, perceived, as, if, perpendicular, his, arguments, regarding, perpendicular, rays, do, not, clearly, explain, why, only, perpendicular, rays, were, perceived, why, would, the, weaker, oblique, rays, not, be, perceived, more, weakly, his, later, argument, that, refracted, rays, would, be, perceived, as, if, perpendicular, does, not, seem, persuasive, however, despite, its, weaknesses, no, other, theory, of, the, time, was, so, comprehensive, and, it, was, enormously, influential, particularly, in, western, europe, directly, or, indirectly, his, de, aspectibus, book, of, optics, inspired, much, activity, in, optics, between, the, 13th, and, 17th, centuries, kepler, s, later, theory, of, the, retinal, image, which, resolved, the, problem, of, the, correspondence, of, points, on, an, object, and, points, in, the, eye, built, directly, on, the, conceptual, framework, of, alhazen, alhazen, showed, through, experiment, that, light, travels, in, straight, lines, and, carried, out, various, experiments, with, lenses, mirrors, refraction, and, reflection, his, analyses, of, reflection, and, refraction, considered, the, vertical, and, horizontal, components, of, light, rays, separately, alhazen, studied, the, process, of, sight, the, structure, of, the, eye, image, formation, in, the, eye, and, the, visual, system, ian, p, howard, argued, in, a, 1996, perception, article, that, alhazen, should, be, credited, with, many, discoveries, and, theories, previously, attributed, to, western, europeans, writing, centuries, later, for, example, he, described, what, became, in, the, 19th, century, hering, s, law, of, equal, innervation, he, wrote, a, description, of, vertical, horopters, 600, years, before, aguilonius, that, is, actually, closer, to, the, modern, definition, than, aguilonius, s, and, his, work, on, binocular, disparity, was, repeated, by, panum, in, 1858, craig, aaen, stockdale, while, agreeing, that, alhazen, should, be, credited, with, many, advances, has, expressed, some, caution, especially, when, considering, alhazen, in, isolation, from, ptolemy, with, whom, alhazen, was, extremely, familiar, alhazen, corrected, a, significant, error, of, ptolemy, regarding, binocular, vision, but, otherwise, his, account, is, very, similar, ptolemy, also, attempted, to, explain, what, is, now, called, hering, s, law, in, general, alhazen, built, on, and, expanded, the, optics, of, ptolemy, in, a, more, detailed, account, of, ibn, al, haytham, s, contribution, to, the, study, of, binocular, vision, based, on, lejeune, and, sabra, raynaud, showed, that, the, concepts, of, correspondence, homonymous, and, crossed, diplopia, were, in, place, in, ibn, al, haytham, s, optics, but, contrary, to, howard, he, explained, why, ibn, al, haytham, did, not, give, the, circular, figure, of, the, horopter, and, why, by, reasoning, experimentally, he, was, in, fact, closer, to, the, discovery, of, panum, s, fusional, area, than, that, of, the, vieth, m, ller, circle, in, this, regard, ibn, al, haytham, s, theory, of, binocular, vision, faced, two, main, limits, the, lack, of, recognition, of, the, role, of, the, retina, and, obviously, the, lack, of, an, experimental, investigation, of, ocular, tracts, alhazen, s, most, original, contribution, was, that, after, describing, how, he, thought, the, eye, was, anatomically, constructed, he, went, on, to, consider, how, this, anatomy, would, behave, functionally, as, an, optical, system, his, understanding, of, pinhole, projection, from, his, experiments, appears, to, have, influenced, his, consideration, of, image, inversion, in, the, eye, which, he, sought, to, avoid, he, maintained, that, the, rays, that, fell, perpendicularly, on, the, lens, or, glacial, humor, as, he, called, it, were, further, refracted, outward, as, they, left, the, glacial, humor, and, the, resulting, image, thus, passed, upright, into, the, optic, nerve, at, the, back, of, the, eye, he, followed, galen, in, believing, that, the, lens, was, the, receptive, organ, of, sight, although, some, of, his, work, hints, that, he, thought, the, retina, was, also, involved, alhazen, s, synthesis, of, light, and, vision, adhered, to, the, aristotelian, scheme, exhaustively, describing, the, process, of, vision, in, a, logical, complete, fashion, his, research, in, catoptrics, the, study, of, optical, systems, using, mirrors, was, centred, on, spherical, and, parabolic, mirrors, and, spherical, aberration, he, made, the, observation, that, the, ratio, between, the, angle, of, incidence, and, refraction, does, not, remain, constant, and, investigated, the, magnifying, power, of, a, lens, alhazen, was, the, first, physicist, to, give, complete, statement, of, the, law, of, reflection, he, was, first, to, state, that, the, incident, ray, the, reflected, ray, and, the, normal, to, the, surface, all, lie, in, a, same, plane, perpendicular, to, reflecting, plane, his, work, on, catoptrics, in, book, v, of, the, book, of, optics, contains, a, discussion, of, what, is, now, known, as, alhazen, s, problem, first, formulated, by, ptolemy, in, 150, ad, it, comprises, drawing, lines, from, two, points, in, the, plane, of, a, circle, meeting, at, a, point, on, the, circumference, and, making, equal, angles, with, the, normal, at, that, point, this, is, equivalent, to, finding, the, point, on, the, edge, of, a, circular, billiard, table, at, which, a, player, must, aim, a, cue, ball, at, a, given, point, to, make, it, bounce, off, the, table, edge, and, hit, another, ball, at, a, second, given, point, thus, its, main, application, in, optics, is, to, solve, the, problem, given, a, light, source, and, a, spherical, mirror, find, the, point, on, the, mirror, where, the, light, will, be, reflected, to, the, eye, of, an, observer, this, leads, to, an, equation, of, the, fourth, degree, this, eventually, led, alhazen, to, derive, a, formula, for, the, sum, of, fourth, powers, where, previously, only, the, formulas, for, the, sums, of, squares, and, cubes, had, been, stated, his, method, can, be, readily, generalized, to, find, the, formula, for, the, sum, of, any, integral, powers, although, he, did, not, himself, do, this, perhaps, because, he, only, needed, the, fourth, power, to, calculate, the, volume, of, the, paraboloid, he, was, interested, in, he, used, his, result, on, sums, of, integral, powers, to, perform, what, would, now, be, called, an, integration, where, the, formulas, for, the, sums, of, integral, squares, and, fourth, powers, allowed, him, to, calculate, the, volume, of, a, paraboloid, alhazen, eventually, solved, the, problem, using, conic, sections, and, a, geometric, proof, his, solution, was, extremely, long, and, complicated, and, may, not, have, been, understood, by, mathematicians, reading, him, in, latin, translation, later, mathematicians, used, descartes, analytical, methods, to, analyse, the, problem, an, algebraic, solution, to, the, problem, was, finally, found, in, 1965, by, jack, m, elkin, an, actuarian, other, solutions, were, discovered, in, 1989, by, harald, riede, and, in, 1997, by, the, oxford, mathematician, peter, m, neumann, recently, mitsubishi, electric, research, laboratories, merl, researchers, solved, the, extension, of, alhazen, s, problem, to, general, rotationally, symmetric, quadric, mirrors, including, hyperbolic, parabolic, and, elliptical, mirrors, the, camera, obscura, was, known, to, the, ancient, chinese, and, was, described, by, the, han, chinese, polymath, shen, kuo, in, his, scientific, book, dream, pool, essays, published, in, the, year, 1088, c, e, aristotle, had, discussed, the, basic, principle, behind, it, in, his, problems, but, alhazen, s, work, contained, the, first, clear, description, of, camera, obscura, and, early, analysis, of, the, device, ibn, al, haytham, used, a, camera, obscura, mainly, to, observe, a, partial, solar, eclipse, in, his, essay, ibn, al, haytham, writes, that, he, observed, the, sickle, like, shape, of, the, sun, at, the, time, of, an, eclipse, the, introduction, reads, as, follows, the, image, of, the, sun, at, the, time, of, the, eclipse, unless, it, is, total, demonstrates, that, when, its, light, passes, through, a, narrow, round, hole, and, is, cast, on, a, plane, opposite, to, the, hole, it, takes, on, the, form, of, a, moonsickle, it, is, admitted, that, his, findings, solidified, the, importance, in, the, history, of, the, camera, obscura, but, this, treatise, is, important, in, many, other, respects, ancient, optics, and, medieval, optics, were, divided, into, optics, and, burning, mirrors, optics, proper, mainly, focused, on, the, study, of, vision, while, burning, mirrors, focused, on, the, properties, of, light, and, luminous, rays, on, the, shape, of, the, eclipse, is, probably, one, of, the, first, attempts, made, by, ibn, al, haytham, to, articulate, these, two, sciences, very, often, ibn, al, haytham, s, discoveries, benefited, from, the, intersection, of, mathematical, and, experimental, contributions, this, is, the, case, with, on, the, shape, of, the, eclipse, besides, the, fact, that, this, treatise, allowed, more, people, to, study, partial, eclipses, of, the, sun, it, especially, allowed, to, better, understand, how, the, camera, obscura, works, this, treatise, is, a, physico, mathematical, study, of, image, formation, inside, the, camera, obscura, ibn, al, haytham, takes, an, experimental, approach, and, determines, the, result, by, varying, the, size, and, the, shape, of, the, aperture, the, focal, length, of, the, camera, the, shape, and, intensity, of, the, light, source, in, his, work, he, explains, the, inversion, of, the, image, in, the, camera, obscura, the, fact, that, the, image, is, similar, to, the, source, when, the, hole, is, small, but, also, the, fact, that, the, image, can, differ, from, the, source, when, the, hole, is, large, all, these, results, are, produced, by, using, a, point, analysis, of, the, image, in, the, seventh, tract, of, his, book, of, optics, alhazen, described, an, apparatus, for, experimenting, with, various, cases, of, refraction, in, order, to, investigate, the, relations, between, the, angle, of, incidence, the, angle, of, refraction, and, the, angle, of, deflection, this, apparatus, was, a, modified, version, of, an, apparatus, used, by, ptolemy, for, similar, purpose, alhazen, basically, states, the, concept, of, unconscious, inference, in, his, discussion, of, colour, before, adding, that, the, inferential, step, between, sensing, colour, and, differentiating, it, is, shorter, than, the, time, taken, between, sensing, and, any, other, visible, characteristic, aside, from, light, and, that, time, is, so, short, as, not, to, be, clearly, apparent, to, the, beholder, naturally, this, suggests, that, the, colour, and, form, are, perceived, elsewhere, alhazen, goes, on, to, say, that, information, must, travel, to, the, central, nerve, cavity, for, processing, and, the, sentient, organ, does, not, sense, the, forms, that, reach, it, from, the, visible, objects, until, after, it, has, been, affected, by, these, forms, thus, it, does, not, sense, color, as, color, or, light, as, light, until, after, it, has, been, affected, by, the, form, of, color, or, light, now, the, affectation, received, by, the, sentient, organ, from, the, form, of, color, or, of, light, is, a, certain, change, and, change, must, take, place, in, time, and, it, is, in, the, time, during, which, the, form, extends, from, the, sentient, organ, s, surface, to, the, cavity, of, the, common, nerve, and, in, the, time, following, that, that, the, sensitive, faculty, which, exists, in, the, whole, of, the, sentient, body, will, perceive, color, as, color, thus, the, last, sentient, s, perception, of, color, as, such, and, of, light, as, such, takes, place, at, a, time, following, that, in, which, the, form, arrives, from, the, surface, of, the, sentient, organ, to, the, cavity, of, the, common, nerve, alhazen, explained, color, constancy, by, observing, that, the, light, reflected, from, an, object, is, modified, by, the, object, s, color, he, explained, that, the, quality, of, the, light, and, the, color, of, the, object, are, mixed, and, the, visual, system, separates, light, and, color, in, book, ii, chapter, 3, he, writes, again, the, light, does, not, travel, from, the, colored, object, to, the, eye, unaccompanied, by, the, color, nor, does, the, form, of, the, color, pass, from, the, colored, object, to, the, eye, unaccompanied, by, the, light, neither, the, form, of, the, light, nor, that, of, the, color, existing, in, the, colored, object, can, pass, except, as, mingled, together, and, the, last, sentient, can, only, perceive, them, as, mingled, together, nevertheless, the, sentient, perceives, that, the, visible, object, is, luminous, and, that, the, light, seen, in, the, object, is, other, than, the, color, and, that, these, are, two, properties, the, kitab, al, manazir, book, of, optics, describes, several, experimental, observations, that, alhazen, made, and, how, he, used, his, results, to, explain, certain, optical, phenomena, using, mechanical, analogies, he, conducted, experiments, with, projectiles, and, concluded, that, only, the, impact, of, perpendicular, projectiles, on, surfaces, was, forceful, enough, to, make, them, penetrate, whereas, surfaces, tended, to, deflect, oblique, projectile, strikes, for, example, to, explain, refraction, from, a, rare, to, a, dense, medium, he, used, the, mechanical, analogy, of, an, iron, ball, thrown, at, a, thin, slate, covering, a, wide, hole, in, a, metal, sheet, a, perpendicular, throw, breaks, the, slate, and, passes, through, whereas, an, oblique, one, with, equal, force, and, from, an, equal, distance, does, not, he, also, used, this, result, to, explain, how, intense, direct, light, hurts, the, eye, using, a, mechanical, analogy, alhazen, associated, strong, lights, with, perpendicular, rays, and, weak, lights, with, oblique, ones, the, obvious, answer, to, the, problem, of, multiple, rays, and, the, eye, was, in, the, choice, of, the, perpendicular, ray, since, only, one, such, ray, from, each, point, on, the, surface, of, the, object, could, penetrate, the, eye, sudanese, psychologist, omar, khaleefa, has, argued, that, alhazen, should, be, considered, the, founder, of, experimental, psychology, for, his, pioneering, work, on, the, psychology, of, visual, perception, and, optical, illusions, khaleefa, has, also, argued, that, alhazen, should, also, be, considered, the, founder, of, psychophysics, a, sub, discipline, and, precursor, to, modern, psychology, although, alhazen, made, many, subjective, reports, regarding, vision, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, used, quantitative, psychophysical, techniques, and, the, claim, has, been, rebuffed, alhazen, offered, an, explanation, of, the, moon, illusion, an, illusion, that, played, an, important, role, in, the, scientific, tradition, of, medieval, europe, many, authors, repeated, explanations, that, attempted, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, moon, appearing, larger, near, the, horizon, than, it, does, when, higher, up, in, the, sky, alhazen, argued, against, ptolemy, s, refraction, theory, and, defined, the, problem, in, terms, of, perceived, rather, than, real, enlargement, he, said, that, judging, the, distance, of, an, object, depends, on, there, being, an, uninterrupted, sequence, of, intervening, bodies, between, the, object, and, the, observer, when, the, moon, is, high, in, the, sky, there, are, no, intervening, objects, so, the, moon, appears, close, the, perceived, size, of, an, object, of, constant, angular, size, varies, with, its, perceived, distance, therefore, the, moon, appears, closer, and, smaller, high, in, the, sky, and, further, and, larger, on, the, horizon, through, works, by, roger, bacon, john, pecham, and, witelo, based, on, alhazen, s, explanation, the, moon, illusion, gradually, came, to, be, accepted, as, a, psychological, phenomenon, with, the, refraction, theory, being, rejected, in, the, 17th, century, although, alhazen, is, often, credited, with, the, perceived, distance, explanation, he, was, not, the, first, author, to, offer, it, cleomedes, c, 2nd, century, gave, this, account, in, addition, to, refraction, and, he, credited, it, to, posidonius, c, 135, 50, bce, ptolemy, may, also, have, offered, this, explanation, in, his, optics, but, the, text, is, obscure, alhazen, s, writings, were, more, widely, available, in, the, middle, ages, than, those, of, these, earlier, authors, and, that, probably, explains, why, alhazen, received, the, credit, therefore, the, seeker, after, the, truth, is, not, one, who, studies, the, writings, of, the, ancients, and, following, his, natural, disposition, puts, his, trust, in, them, but, rather, the, one, who, suspects, his, faith, in, them, and, questions, what, he, gathers, from, them, the, one, who, submits, to, argument, and, demonstration, and, not, to, the, sayings, of, a, human, being, whose, nature, is, fraught, with, all, kinds, of, imperfection, and, deficiency, the, duty, of, the, man, who, investigates, the, writings, of, scientists, if, learning, the, truth, is, his, goal, is, to, make, himself, an, enemy, of, all, that, he, reads, and, attack, it, from, every, side, he, should, also, suspect, himself, as, he, performs, his, critical, examination, of, it, so, that, he, may, avoid, falling, into, either, prejudice, or, leniency, an, aspect, associated, with, alhazen, s, optical, research, is, related, to, systemic, and, methodological, reliance, on, experimentation, i, tibar, arabic, and, controlled, testing, in, his, scientific, inquiries, moreover, his, experimental, directives, rested, on, combining, classical, physics, ilm, tabi, i, with, mathematics, ta, alim, geometry, in, particular, this, mathematical, physical, approach, to, experimental, science, supported, most, of, his, propositions, in, kitab, al, manazir, the, optics, de, aspectibus, or, perspectivae, and, grounded, his, theories, of, vision, light, and, colour, as, well, as, his, research, in, catoptrics, and, dioptrics, the, study, of, the, reflection, and, refraction, of, light, respectively, according, to, matthias, schramm, alhazen, was, the, first, to, make, a, systematic, use, of, the, method, of, varying, the, experimental, conditions, in, a, constant, and, uniform, manner, in, an, experiment, showing, that, the, intensity, of, the, light, spot, formed, by, the, projection, of, the, moonlight, through, two, small, apertures, onto, a, screen, diminishes, constantly, as, one, of, the, apertures, is, gradually, blocked, up, g, j, toomer, expressed, some, skepticism, regarding, schramm, s, view, partly, because, at, the, time, 1964, the, book, of, optics, had, not, yet, been, fully, translated, from, arabic, and, toomer, was, concerned, that, without, context, specific, passages, might, be, read, anachronistically, while, acknowledging, alhazen, s, importance, in, developing, experimental, techniques, toomer, argued, that, alhazen, should, not, be, considered, in, isolation, from, other, islamic, and, ancient, thinkers, toomer, concluded, his, review, by, saying, that, it, would, not, be, possible, to, assess, schramm, s, claim, that, ibn, al, haytham, was, the, true, founder, of, modern, physics, without, translating, more, of, alhazen, s, work, and, fully, investigating, his, influence, on, later, medieval, writers, besides, the, book, of, optics, alhazen, wrote, several, other, treatises, on, the, same, subject, including, his, risala, fi, l, daw, treatise, on, light, he, investigated, the, properties, of, luminance, the, rainbow, eclipses, twilight, and, moonlight, experiments, with, mirrors, and, the, refractive, interfaces, between, air, water, and, glass, cubes, hemispheres, and, quarter, spheres, provided, the, foundation, for, his, theories, on, catoptrics, alhazen, discussed, the, physics, of, the, celestial, region, in, his, epitome, of, astronomy, arguing, that, ptolemaic, models, must, be, understood, in, terms, of, physical, objects, rather, than, abstract, hypotheses, in, other, words, that, it, should, be, possible, to, create, physical, models, where, for, example, none, of, the, celestial, bodies, would, collide, with, each, other, the, suggestion, of, mechanical, models, for, the, earth, centred, ptolemaic, model, greatly, contributed, to, the, eventual, triumph, of, the, ptolemaic, system, among, the, christians, of, the, west, alhazen, s, determination, to, root, astronomy, in, the, realm, of, physical, objects, was, important, however, because, it, meant, astronomical, hypotheses, were, accountable, to, the, laws, of, physics, and, could, be, criticised, and, improved, upon, in, those, terms, he, also, wrote, maqala, fi, daw, al, qamar, on, the, light, of, the, moon, in, his, work, alhazen, discussed, theories, on, the, motion, of, a, body, in, his, on, the, configuration, of, the, world, alhazen, presented, a, detailed, description, of, the, physical, structure, of, the, earth, the, earth, as, a, whole, is, a, round, sphere, whose, center, is, the, center, of, the, world, it, is, stationary, in, its, middle, fixed, in, it, and, not, moving, in, any, direction, nor, moving, with, any, of, the, varieties, of, motion, but, always, at, rest, the, book, is, a, non, technical, explanation, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, which, was, eventually, translated, into, hebrew, and, latin, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, and, subsequently, had, an, influence, on, astronomers, such, as, georg, von, peuerbach, during, the, european, middle, ages, and, renaissance, in, his, al, shuk, k, al, batlamy, s, variously, translated, as, doubts, concerning, ptolemy, or, aporias, against, ptolemy, published, at, some, time, between, 1025, and, 1028, alhazen, criticized, ptolemy, s, almagest, planetary, hypotheses, and, optics, pointing, out, various, contradictions, he, found, in, these, works, particularly, in, astronomy, ptolemy, s, almagest, concerned, mathematical, theories, regarding, the, motion, of, the, planets, whereas, the, hypotheses, concerned, what, ptolemy, thought, was, the, actual, configuration, of, the, planets, ptolemy, himself, acknowledged, that, his, theories, and, configurations, did, not, always, agree, with, each, other, arguing, that, this, was, not, a, problem, provided, it, did, not, result, in, noticeable, error, but, alhazen, was, particularly, scathing, in, his, criticism, of, the, inherent, contradictions, in, ptolemy, s, works, he, considered, that, some, of, the, mathematical, devices, ptolemy, introduced, into, astronomy, especially, the, equant, failed, to, satisfy, the, physical, requirement, of, uniform, circular, motion, and, noted, the, absurdity, of, relating, actual, physical, motions, to, imaginary, mathematical, points, lines, and, circles, ptolemy, assumed, an, arrangement, hay, a, that, cannot, exist, and, the, fact, that, this, arrangement, produces, in, his, imagination, the, motions, that, belong, to, the, planets, does, not, free, him, from, the, error, he, committed, in, his, assumed, arrangement, for, the, existing, motions, of, the, planets, cannot, be, the, result, of, an, arrangement, that, is, impossible, to, exist, or, a, man, to, imagine, a, circle, in, the, heavens, and, to, imagine, the, planet, moving, in, it, does, not, bring, about, the, planet, s, motion, having, pointed, out, the, problems, alhazen, appears, to, have, intended, to, resolve, the, contradictions, he, pointed, out, in, ptolemy, in, a, later, work, alhazen, believed, there, was, a, true, configuration, of, the, planets, that, ptolemy, had, failed, to, grasp, he, intended, to, complete, and, repair, ptolemy, s, system, not, to, replace, it, completely, in, the, doubts, concerning, ptolemy, alhazen, set, out, his, views, on, the, difficulty, of, attaining, scientific, knowledge, and, the, need, to, question, existing, authorities, and, theories, truth, is, sought, for, itself, the, truths, are, immersed, in, uncertainties, not, immune, from, error, he, held, that, the, criticism, of, existing, theories, which, dominated, this, book, holds, a, special, place, in, the, growth, of, scientific, knowledge, alhazen, s, the, model, of, the, motions, of, each, of, the, seven, planets, was, written, c, 1038, only, one, damaged, manuscript, has, been, found, with, only, the, introduction, and, the, first, section, on, the, theory, of, planetary, motion, surviving, there, was, also, a, second, section, on, astronomical, calculation, and, a, third, section, on, astronomical, instruments, following, on, from, his, doubts, on, ptolemy, alhazen, described, a, new, geometry, based, planetary, model, describing, the, motions, of, the, planets, in, terms, of, spherical, geometry, infinitesimal, geometry, and, trigonometry, he, kept, a, geocentric, universe, and, assumed, that, celestial, motions, are, uniformly, circular, which, required, the, inclusion, of, epicycles, to, explain, observed, motion, but, he, managed, to, eliminate, ptolemy, s, equant, in, general, his, model, didn, t, try, to, provide, a, causal, explanation, of, the, motions, but, concentrated, on, providing, a, complete, geometric, description, that, could, explain, observed, motions, without, the, contradictions, inherent, in, ptolemy, s, model, alhazen, wrote, a, total, of, twenty, five, astronomical, works, some, concerning, technical, issues, such, as, exact, determination, of, the, meridian, a, second, group, concerning, accurate, astronomical, observation, a, third, group, concerning, various, astronomical, problems, and, questions, such, as, the, location, of, the, milky, way, alhazen, made, the, first, systematic, effort, of, evaluating, the, milky, way, s, parallax, combining, ptolemy, s, data, and, his, own, he, concluded, that, the, parallax, is, probably, very, much, smaller, than, lunar, parallax, and, the, milky, way, should, be, a, celestial, object, though, he, was, not, the, first, who, argued, that, the, milky, way, does, not, belong, to, the, atmosphere, he, is, the, first, who, did, quantitative, analysis, for, the, claim, the, fourth, group, consists, of, ten, works, on, astronomical, theory, including, the, doubts, and, model, of, the, motions, discussed, above, in, mathematics, alhazen, built, on, the, mathematical, works, of, euclid, and, thabit, ibn, qurra, and, worked, on, the, beginnings, of, the, link, between, algebra, and, geometry, alhazen, made, developments, in, conic, sections, and, number, theory, he, developed, a, formula, for, summing, the, first, 100, natural, numbers, using, a, geometric, proof, to, prove, the, formula, alhazen, explored, what, is, now, known, as, the, euclidean, parallel, postulate, the, fifth, postulate, in, euclid, s, elements, using, a, proof, by, contradiction, and, in, effect, introducing, the, concept, of, motion, into, geometry, he, formulated, the, lambert, quadrilateral, which, boris, abramovich, rozenfeld, names, the, ibn, al, haytham, lambert, quadrilateral, he, was, criticised, by, omar, khayyam, who, pointed, that, aristotle, had, condemned, the, use, of, motion, in, geometry, in, elementary, geometry, alhazen, attempted, to, solve, the, problem, of, squaring, the, circle, using, the, area, of, lunes, crescent, shapes, but, later, gave, up, on, the, impossible, task, the, two, lunes, formed, from, a, right, triangle, by, erecting, a, semicircle, on, each, of, the, triangle, s, sides, inward, for, the, hypotenuse, and, outward, for, the, other, two, sides, are, known, as, the, lunes, of, alhazen, they, have, the, same, total, area, as, the, triangle, itself, alhazen, s, contributions, to, number, theory, include, his, work, on, perfect, numbers, in, his, analysis, and, synthesis, he, may, have, been, the, first, to, state, that, every, even, perfect, number, is, of, the, form, 2, n, 1, 2, n, 1, where, 2, n, 1, is, prime, but, he, was, not, able, to, prove, this, result, euler, later, proved, it, in, the, 18th, century, and, it, is, now, called, the, euclid, euler, theorem, alhazen, solved, problems, involving, congruences, using, what, is, now, called, wilson, s, theorem, in, his, opuscula, alhazen, considers, the, solution, of, a, system, of, congruences, and, gives, two, general, methods, of, solution, his, first, method, the, canonical, method, involved, wilson, s, theorem, while, his, second, method, involved, a, version, of, the, chinese, remainder, theorem, alhazen, discovered, the, sum, formula, for, the, fourth, power, using, a, method, that, could, be, generally, used, to, determine, the, sum, for, any, integral, power, he, used, this, to, find, the, volume, of, a, paraboloid, he, could, find, the, integral, formula, for, any, polynomial, without, having, developed, a, general, formula, alhazen, also, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, influence, of, melodies, on, the, souls, of, animals, although, no, copies, have, survived, it, appears, to, have, been, concerned, with, the, question, of, whether, animals, could, react, to, music, for, example, whether, a, camel, would, increase, or, decrease, its, pace, in, engineering, one, account, of, his, career, as, a, civil, engineer, has, him, summoned, to, egypt, by, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, to, regulate, the, flooding, of, the, nile, river, he, carried, out, a, detailed, scientific, study, of, the, annual, inundation, of, the, nile, river, and, he, drew, plans, for, building, a, dam, at, the, site, of, the, modern, day, aswan, dam, his, field, work, however, later, made, him, aware, of, the, impracticality, of, this, scheme, and, he, soon, feigned, madness, so, he, could, avoid, punishment, from, the, caliph, in, his, treatise, on, place, alhazen, disagreed, with, aristotle, s, view, that, nature, abhors, a, void, and, he, used, geometry, in, an, attempt, to, demonstrate, that, place, al, makan, is, the, imagined, three, dimensional, void, between, the, inner, surfaces, of, a, containing, body, abd, el, latif, a, supporter, of, aristotle, s, philosophical, view, of, place, later, criticized, the, work, in, fi, al, radd, ala, ibn, al, haytham, fi, al, makan, a, refutation, of, ibn, al, haytham, s, place, for, its, geometrization, of, place, alhazen, also, discussed, space, perception, and, its, epistemological, implications, in, his, book, of, optics, in, tying, the, visual, perception, of, space, to, prior, bodily, experience, alhazen, unequivocally, rejected, the, intuitiveness, of, spatial, perception, and, therefore, the, autonomy, of, vision, without, tangible, notions, of, distance, and, size, for, correlation, sight, can, tell, us, next, to, nothing, about, such, things, alhazen, was, a, muslim, and, most, sources, report, that, he, was, a, sunni, and, a, follower, of, the, ash, ari, school, ziauddin, sardar, says, that, some, of, the, greatest, muslim, scientists, such, as, ibn, al, haytham, and, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, who, were, pioneers, of, the, scientific, method, were, themselves, followers, of, the, ash, ari, school, of, islamic, theology, like, other, ash, arites, who, believed, that, faith, or, taqlid, should, apply, only, to, islam, and, not, to, any, ancient, hellenistic, authorities, ibn, al, haytham, s, view, that, taqlid, should, apply, only, to, prophets, of, islam, and, not, to, any, other, authorities, formed, the, basis, for, much, of, his, scientific, skepticism, and, criticism, against, ptolemy, and, other, ancient, authorities, in, his, doubts, concerning, ptolemy, and, book, of, optics, alhazen, wrote, a, work, on, islamic, theology, in, which, he, discussed, prophethood, and, developed, a, system, of, philosophical, criteria, to, discern, its, false, claimants, in, his, time, he, also, wrote, a, treatise, entitled, finding, the, direction, of, qibla, by, calculation, in, which, he, discussed, finding, the, qibla, where, prayers, salat, are, directed, towards, mathematically, there, are, occasional, references, to, theology, or, religious, sentiment, in, his, technical, works, e, g, in, doubts, concerning, ptolemy, truth, is, sought, for, its, own, sake, finding, the, truth, is, difficult, and, the, road, to, it, is, rough, for, the, truths, are, plunged, in, obscurity, god, however, has, not, preserved, the, scientist, from, error, and, has, not, safeguarded, science, from, shortcomings, and, faults, if, this, had, been, the, case, scientists, would, not, have, disagreed, upon, any, point, of, science, in, the, winding, motion, from, the, statements, made, by, the, noble, shaykh, it, is, clear, that, he, believes, in, ptolemy, s, words, in, everything, he, says, without, relying, on, a, demonstration, or, calling, on, a, proof, but, by, pure, imitation, taqlid, that, is, how, experts, in, the, prophetic, tradition, have, faith, in, prophets, may, the, blessing, of, god, be, upon, them, but, it, is, not, the, way, that, mathematicians, have, faith, in, specialists, in, the, demonstrative, sciences, regarding, the, relation, of, objective, truth, and, god, i, constantly, sought, knowledge, and, truth, and, it, became, my, belief, that, for, gaining, access, to, the, effulgence, and, closeness, to, god, there, is, no, better, way, than, that, of, searching, for, truth, and, knowledge, alhazen, made, significant, contributions, to, optics, number, theory, geometry, astronomy, and, natural, philosophy, alhazen, s, work, on, optics, is, credited, with, contributing, a, new, emphasis, on, experiment, his, main, work, kitab, al, manazir, book, of, optics, was, known, in, the, muslim, world, mainly, but, not, exclusively, through, the, thirteenth, century, commentary, by, kam, l, al, d, n, al, f, ris, the, tanq, al, man, ir, li, dhaw, l, ab, r, wa, l, ba, ir, in, al, andalus, it, was, used, by, the, eleventh, century, prince, of, the, banu, hud, dynasty, of, zaragossa, and, author, of, an, important, mathematical, text, al, mu, taman, ibn, h, d, a, latin, translation, of, the, kitab, al, manazir, was, made, probably, in, the, late, twelfth, or, early, thirteenth, century, this, translation, was, read, by, and, greatly, influenced, a, number, of, scholars, in, christian, europe, including, roger, bacon, robert, grosseteste, witelo, giambattista, della, porta, leonardo, da, vinci, galileo, galilei, christiaan, huygens, ren, descartes, and, johannes, kepler, meanwhile, in, the, islamic, world, alhazen, s, work, influenced, averroes, writings, on, optics, and, his, legacy, was, further, advanced, through, the, reforming, of, his, optics, by, persian, scientist, kamal, al, din, al, farisi, died, c, 1320, in, the, latter, s, kitab, tanqih, al, manazir, the, revision, of, optics, alhazen, wrote, as, many, as, 200, books, although, only, 55, have, survived, some, of, his, treatises, on, optics, survived, only, through, latin, translation, during, the, middle, ages, his, books, on, cosmology, were, translated, into, latin, hebrew, and, other, languages, h, j, j, winter, a, british, historian, of, science, summing, up, the, importance, of, ibn, al, haytham, in, the, history, of, physics, wrote, after, the, death, of, archimedes, no, really, great, physicist, appeared, until, ibn, al, haytham, if, therefore, we, confine, our, interest, only, to, the, history, of, physics, there, is, a, long, period, of, over, twelve, hundred, years, during, which, the, golden, age, of, greece, gave, way, to, the, era, of, muslim, scholasticism, and, the, experimental, spirit, of, the, noblest, physicist, of, antiquity, lived, again, in, the, arab, scholar, from, basra, although, only, one, commentary, on, alhazen, s, optics, has, survived, the, islamic, middle, ages, geoffrey, chaucer, mentions, the, work, in, the, canterbury, tales, they, spoke, of, alhazen, and, vitello, and, aristotle, who, wrote, in, their, lives, on, strange, mirrors, and, optical, instruments, the, impact, crater, alhazen, on, the, moon, is, named, in, his, honour, as, was, the, asteroid, 59239, alhazen, in, honour, of, alhazen, the, aga, khan, university, pakistan, named, its, ophthalmology, endowed, chair, as, the, ibn, e, haitham, associate, professor, and, chief, of, ophthalmology, the, 2015, international, year, of, light, celebrated, the, 1000th, anniversary, of, the, works, on, optics, by, ibn, al, haytham, in, 2014, the, hiding, in, the, light, episode, of, cosmos, a, spacetime, odyssey, presented, by, neil, degrasse, tyson, focused, on, the, accomplishments, of, ibn, al, haytham, he, was, voiced, by, alfred, molina, in, the, episode, over, forty, years, previously, jacob, bronowski, presented, alhazen, s, work, in, a, similar, television, documentary, and, the, corresponding, book, the, ascent, of, man, in, episode, 5, the, music, of, the, spheres, bronowski, remarked, that, in, his, view, alhazen, was, the, one, really, original, scientific, mind, that, arab, culture, produced, whose, theory, of, optics, was, not, improved, on, till, the, time, of, newton, and, leibniz, unesco, declared, 2015, the, international, year, of, light, and, its, director, general, irina, bokova, dubbed, ibn, al, haytham, the, father, of, optics, amongst, others, this, was, to, celebrate, ibn, al, haytham, s, achievements, in, optics, mathematics, and, astronomy, an, international, campaign, created, by, the, 1001, inventions, organisation, titled, 1001, inventions, and, the, world, of, ibn, al, haytham, featuring, a, series, of, interactive, exhibits, workshops, and, live, shows, about, his, work, partnering, with, science, centers, science, festivals, museums, and, educational, institutions, as, well, as, digital, and, social, media, platforms, the, campaign, also, produced, and, released, the, short, educational, film, 1001, inventions, and, the, world, of, ibn, al, haytham, ibn, al, haytham, appears, on, the, 10, 000, dinar, banknote, of, the, iraqi, dinar, series, 2003, according, to, medieval, biographers, alhazen, wrote, more, than, 200, works, on, a, wide, range, of, subjects, of, which, at, least, 96, of, his, scientific, works, are, known, most, of, his, works, are, now, lost, but, more, than, 50, of, them, have, survived, to, some, extent, nearly, half, of, his, surviving, works, are, on, mathematics, 23, of, them, are, on, astronomy, and, 14, of, them, are, on, optics, with, a, few, on, other, subjects, not, all, his, surviving, works, have, yet, been, studied, but, some, of, the, ones, that, have, are, given, below
