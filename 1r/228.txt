is, known, about, ferdowsi, s, early, life, the, poet, had, a, wife, who, was, probably, literate, and, came, from, the, same, dehqan, class, the, dehqans, were, landowning, iranian, aristocrats, who, had, flourished, under, the, sasanian, dynasty, the, last, pre, islamic, dynasty, to, rule, iran, and, whose, power, though, diminished, had, survived, into, the, islamic, era, which, followed, the, islamic, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, the, dehqans, were, attached, to, the, pre, islamic, literary, heritage, as, their, status, was, associated, with, it, so, much, so, that, dehqan, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, iranian, in, the, shahnameh, thus, they, saw, it, as, their, task, to, preserve, the, pre, islamic, cultural, traditions, including, tales, of, legendary, kings, he, had, a, son, who, died, at, the, age, of, 37, and, was, mourned, by, the, poet, in, an, elegy, which, he, inserted, into, the, shahnameh, the, islamic, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, brought, gradual, linguistic, and, cultural, changes, to, the, iranian, plateau, by, the, late, 9th, century, as, the, power, of, the, caliphate, had, weakened, several, local, dynasties, emerged, in, greater, iran, ferdowsi, grew, up, in, tus, a, city, under, the, control, of, one, of, these, dynasties, the, samanids, who, claimed, descent, from, the, sassanid, general, bahram, chobin, whose, story, ferdowsi, recounts, in, one, of, the, later, sections, of, the, shahnameh, the, samanid, bureaucracy, used, the, new, persian, language, which, had, been, used, to, bring, islam, to, the, eastern, regions, of, the, iranian, world, and, supplanted, local, languages, and, commissioned, translations, of, pahlavi, texts, into, new, persian, abu, mansur, muhammad, a, dehqan, and, governor, of, tus, had, ordered, his, minister, abu, mansur, mamari, to, invite, several, local, scholars, to, compile, a, prose, shahnameh, book, of, kings, which, was, completed, in, 1010, although, it, no, longer, survives, ferdowsi, used, it, as, one, of, the, sources, of, his, epic, samanid, rulers, were, patrons, of, such, important, persian, poets, as, rudaki, and, daqiqi, and, ferdowsi, followed, in, the, footsteps, of, these, writers, details, about, ferdowsi, s, education, are, lacking, judging, by, the, shahnameh, there, is, no, evidence, he, knew, either, arabic, or, pahlavi, it, is, possible, that, ferdowsi, wrote, some, early, poems, which, have, not, survived, he, began, work, on, the, shahnameh, around, 977, intending, it, as, a, continuation, of, the, work, of, his, fellow, poet, daqiqi, who, had, been, assassinated, by, his, slave, like, daqiqi, ferdowsi, employed, the, prose, shahnameh, of, abd, al, razz, q, as, a, source, he, received, generous, patronage, from, the, samanid, prince, mansur, and, completed, the, first, version, of, the, shahnameh, in, 994, when, the, turkic, ghaznavids, overthrew, the, samanids, in, the, late, 990s, ferdowsi, continued, to, work, on, the, poem, rewriting, sections, to, praise, the, ghaznavid, sultan, mahmud, mahmud, s, attitude, to, ferdowsi, and, how, well, he, rewarded, the, poet, are, matters, which, have, long, been, subject, to, dispute, and, have, formed, the, basis, of, legends, about, the, poet, and, his, patron, see, below, the, turkic, mahmud, may, have, been, less, interested, in, tales, from, iranian, history, than, the, samanids, the, later, sections, of, the, shahnameh, have, passages, which, reveal, ferdowsi, s, fluctuating, moods, in, some, he, complains, about, old, age, poverty, illness, and, the, death, of, his, son, in, others, he, appears, happier, ferdowsi, finally, completed, his, epic, on, 8, march, 1010, virtually, nothing, is, known, with, any, certainty, about, the, last, decade, of, his, life, ferdowsi, was, buried, in, his, own, garden, burial, in, the, cemetery, of, tus, having, been, forbidden, by, a, local, cleric, a, ghaznavid, governor, of, khorasan, constructed, a, mausoleum, over, the, grave, and, it, became, a, revered, site, the, tomb, which, had, fallen, into, decay, was, rebuilt, between, 1928, and, 1934, by, the, society, for, the, national, heritage, of, iran, on, the, orders, of, reza, shah, and, has, now, become, the, equivalent, of, a, national, shrine, according, to, legend, sultan, mahmud, of, ghazni, offered, ferdowsi, a, gold, piece, for, every, couplet, of, the, shahnameh, he, wrote, the, poet, agreed, to, receive, the, money, as, a, lump, sum, when, he, had, completed, the, epic, he, planned, to, use, it, to, rebuild, the, dykes, in, his, native, tus, after, thirty, years, of, work, ferdowsi, finished, his, masterpiece, the, sultan, prepared, to, give, him, 60, 000, gold, pieces, one, for, every, couplet, as, agreed, however, the, courtier, whom, mahmud, had, entrusted, with, the, money, despised, ferdowsi, regarding, him, as, a, heretic, and, he, replaced, the, gold, coins, with, silver, ferdowsi, was, in, the, bath, house, when, he, received, the, reward, finding, it, was, silver, and, not, gold, he, gave, the, money, away, to, the, bath, keeper, a, refreshment, seller, and, the, slave, who, had, carried, the, coins, when, the, courtier, told, the, sultan, about, ferdowsi, s, behaviour, he, was, furious, and, threatened, to, execute, him, ferdowsi, fled, to, khorasan, having, first, written, a, satire, on, mahmud, and, spent, most, of, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, exile, mahmud, eventually, learned, the, truth, about, the, courtier, s, deception, and, had, him, either, banished, or, executed, by, this, time, the, aged, ferdowsi, had, returned, to, tus, the, sultan, sent, him, a, new, gift, of, 60, 000, gold, pieces, but, just, as, the, caravan, bearing, the, money, entered, the, gates, of, tus, a, funeral, procession, exited, the, gates, on, the, opposite, side, the, poet, had, died, from, a, heart, attack, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, is, the, most, popular, and, influential, national, epic, in, iran, and, other, persian, speaking, countries, the, shahnameh, is, the, only, surviving, work, by, ferdowsi, regarded, as, indisputably, genuine, he, may, have, written, poems, earlier, in, his, life, but, they, no, longer, exist, a, narrative, poem, y, sof, o, zolayk, joseph, and, zuleika, was, once, attributed, to, him, but, scholarly, consensus, now, rejects, the, idea, it, is, his, there, has, also, been, speculation, about, the, satire, ferdowsi, allegedly, wrote, about, mahmud, of, ghazni, after, the, sultan, failed, to, reward, him, sufficiently, nezami, aruzi, ferdowsi, s, early, biographer, claimed, that, all, but, six, lines, had, been, destroyed, by, a, well, wisher, who, had, paid, ferdowsi, a, thousand, dirhams, for, the, poem, introductions, to, some, manuscripts, of, the, shahnameh, include, verses, purporting, to, be, the, satire, some, scholars, have, viewed, them, as, fabricated, others, are, more, inclined, to, believe, in, their, authenticity, ferdowsi, is, one, of, the, undisputed, giants, of, persian, literature, after, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, a, number, of, other, works, similar, in, nature, surfaced, over, the, centuries, within, the, cultural, sphere, of, the, persian, language, without, exception, all, such, works, were, based, in, style, and, method, on, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, but, none, of, them, could, quite, achieve, the, same, degree, of, fame, and, popularity, as, ferdowsi, s, masterpiece, ferdowsi, has, a, unique, place, in, persian, history, because, of, the, strides, he, made, in, reviving, and, regenerating, the, persian, language, and, cultural, traditions, his, works, are, cited, as, a, crucial, component, in, the, persistence, of, the, persian, language, as, those, works, allowed, much, of, the, tongue, to, remain, codified, and, intact, in, this, respect, ferdowsi, surpasses, nizami, khayy, m, asadi, tusi, and, other, seminal, persian, literary, figures, in, his, impact, on, persian, culture, and, language, many, modern, iranians, see, him, as, the, father, of, the, modern, persian, language, ferdowsi, in, fact, was, a, motivation, behind, many, future, persian, figures, one, such, notable, figure, was, rez, sh, h, pahlavi, who, established, an, academy, of, persian, language, and, literature, in, order, to, attempt, to, remove, arabic, and, french, words, from, the, persian, language, replacing, them, with, suitable, persian, alternatives, in, 1934, rez, sh, h, set, up, a, ceremony, in, mashhad, khorasan, celebrating, a, thousand, years, of, persian, literature, since, the, time, of, ferdowsi, titled, ferdowsi, millennial, celebration, inviting, notable, european, as, well, as, iranian, scholars, ferdowsi, university, of, mashhad, is, a, university, established, in, 1949, that, also, takes, its, name, from, ferdowsi, ferdowsi, s, influence, in, the, persian, culture, is, explained, by, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, library, at, wadham, college, oxford,
