interest, i, believed, in, twelve, tone, music, he, eventually, took, austrian, citizenship, in, 1968, a, few, weeks, after, arriving, in, vienna, ligeti, left, for, cologne, there, he, met, several, key, avant, garde, figures, and, learned, more, contemporary, musical, styles, and, methods, these, people, included, the, composers, karlheinz, stockhausen, and, gottfried, michael, koenig, both, then, working, on, groundbreaking, electronic, music, during, the, summer, he, attended, the, darmst, dter, ferienkurse, ligeti, worked, in, the, cologne, electronic, music, studio, with, stockhausen, and, koenig, and, was, inspired, by, the, sounds, he, heard, there, however, he, produced, little, electronic, music, of, his, own, instead, concentrating, on, instrumental, works, which, often, contain, electronic, sounding, textures, after, about, three, years, working, with, them, he, fell, out, with, the, cologne, school, of, electronic, music, because, there, was, much, factional, in, fighting, there, were, a, lot, of, political, fighting, because, different, people, like, stockhausen, like, kagel, wanted, to, be, first, and, i, personally, have, no, ambition, to, be, first, or, to, be, important, between, 1961, and, 1971, he, was, guest, professor, for, composition, in, stockholm, in, 1972, he, became, composer, in, residence, at, stanford, university, in, the, united,

t, of, the, rheingau, musik, festival, in, 1990, apart, from, his, far, reaching, interest, in, different, styles, of, music, from, renaissance, to, african, music, ligeti, was, also, interested, in, literature, including, the, writers, lewis, carroll, jorge, luis, borges, and, franz, kafka, painting, architecture, science, and, mathematics, he, was, especially, fascinated, by, the, fractal, geometry, of, benoit, mandelbrot, and, the, writings, of, douglas, hofstadter, ligeti, s, health, deteriorated, after, the, turn, of, the, millennium, he, died, in, vienna, on, 12, june, 2006, at, the, age, of, 83, although, it, was, known, that, he, had, been, ill, for, several, years, and, had, used, a, wheelchair, for, the, last, three, years, of, his, life, his, family, declined, to, release, details, of, the, cause, of, his, death, austrian, chancellor, wolfgang, sch, ssel, and, art, secretary, franz, morak, both, paid, tribute, to, ligeti, his, funeral, was, held, at, feuerhalle, simmering, the, memorial, concert, was, performed, by, pierre, laurent, aimard, and, the, arnold, schoenberg, choir, his, ashes, were, buried, at, vienna, central, cemetery, in, a, grave, of, honor, german, ehrengrab, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, vera, and, son, lukas, the, latter, is, a, composer, and, percussionist, based, in, the, united, states, many, of, ligeti, s, earliest, works, were, written, for, chorus, and, included, settings, of, folk, songs, his, largest, work, in, this, period, was, a, graduation, composition, for, the, budapest, academy, entitled, cantata, for, youth, festival, for, four, vocal, soloists, chorus, and, orchestra, one, of, his, earliest, pieces, now, in, the, repertoire, is, his, cello, sonata, a, work, in, two, contrasting, movements, that, were, written, in, 1948, and, 1953, it, was, initially, banned, by, the, soviet, run, composer, s, union, and, was, not, performed, publicly, for, a, quarter, of, a, century, ligeti, s, earliest, works, are, often, an, extension, of, the, musical, language, of, b, la, bart, k, even, his, piano, cycle, musica, ricercata, 1953, though, written, according, to, ligeti, with, a, cartesian, approach, in, which, he, regarded, all, the, music, i, knew, and, loved, as, being, irrelevant, the, piece, has, been, described, by, one, biographer, as, from, a, world, very, close, to, bart, k, s, set, of, piano, works, mikrokosmos, ligeti, s, set, comprises, eleven, pieces, in, all, the, work, is, based, on, a, simple, restriction, the, first, piece, uses, exclusively, one, pitch, a, heard, in, multiple, octaves, and, only, at, the, very, end, of, the, piece, is, a, second, note, d, heard, the, second, piece, uses, three, notes, e, f, and, g, the, third, piece, uses, four, and, so, on, so, that, in, the, final, piece, all, twelve, notes, of, the, chromatic, scale, are, present, shortly, after, its, composition, ligeti, arranged, six, of, the, movements, of, musica, ricercata, for, wind, quintet, under, the, title, six, bagatelles, for, wind, quintet, the, bagatelles, were, performed, first, in, 1956, but, not, in, their, entirety, the, last, movement, was, censored, by, the, soviets, for, being, too, dangerous, because, of, soviet, censorship, his, most, daring, works, from, this, period, including, musica, ricercata, and, his, string, quartet, no, 1, m, tamorphoses, nocturnes, 1953, 1954, were, written, for, the, bottom, drawer, composed, of, a, single, movement, divided, into, seventeen, contrasting, sections, linked, motivically, the, first, string, quartet, is, ligeti, s, first, work, to, suggest, a, personal, style, of, composition, the, string, quartet, was, not, performed, until, 1958, after, he, had, fled, hungary, for, vienna, upon, arriving, in, cologne, ligeti, began, to, write, electronic, music, alongside, karlheinz, stockhausen, and, gottfried, michael, koenig, at, the, electronic, studio, of, west, german, radio, wdr, he, completed, only, two, works, in, this, medium, however, the, pieces, glissandi, 1957, and, artikulation, 1958, before, returning, to, instrumental, music, a, third, work, originally, entitled, atmosph, res, but, later, known, as, pi, ce, lectronique, nr, 3, was, planned, but, the, technical, limitations, of, the, time, prevented, ligeti, from, realizing, it, completely, it, was, finally, realised, in, 1996, by, the, dutch, composers, kees, tazelaar, and, johan, van, kreij, of, the, institute, of, sonology, ligeti, s, music, appears, to, have, been, subsequently, influenced, by, his, electronic, experiments, and, many, of, the, sounds, he, created, resembled, electronic, textures, ligeti, coined, the, term, micropolyphony, to, describe, the, texture, of, the, second, movement, of, apparitions, 1958, 59, and, atmosph, res, 1961, this, texture, is, a, similar, to, that, of, polyphony, except, that, the, polyphony, is, obscured, in, a, dense, and, rich, stack, of, pitches, micropolyphony, can, be, used, to, create, the, nearly, static, but, slowly, evolving, works, such, as, atmosph, res, in, which, the, individual, instruments, become, hidden, in, a, complex, web, of, sound, according, to, ligeti, after, apparitions, and, atmosph, res, he, became, famous, with, volumina, 1961, 62, revised, 1966, for, solo, organ, ligeti, continued, with, clusters, of, notes, translated, into, blocks, of, sound, in, this, piece, ligeti, abandoned, conventional, music, notation, instead, using, diagrams, to, represent, general, pitch, areas, duration, and, flurries, of, notes, po, me, symphonique, 1962, is, a, work, for, one, hundred, mechanical, metronomes, during, his, brief, acquaintance, with, fluxus, movement, aventures, 1962, like, its, companion, piece, nouvelles, aventures, 1962, 65, is, a, composition, for, three, singers, and, instrumental, septet, to, a, text, of, ligeti, s, own, devising, that, is, without, semantic, meaning, in, these, pieces, each, singer, has, five, roles, to, play, exploring, five, areas, of, emotion, and, they, switch, from, one, to, the, other, so, quickly, and, abruptly, that, all, five, areas, are, present, throughout, the, piece, requiem, 1963, 65, is, a, work, for, soprano, and, mezzo, soprano, soloists, twenty, part, chorus, four, each, of, soprano, mezzo, soprano, alto, tenor, and, bass, and, orchestra, though, at, about, half, an, hour, it, is, the, longest, piece, he, had, composed, up, to, that, point, ligeti, sets, only, about, half, of, the, requiem, s, traditional, text, the, introitus, the, kyrie, a, completely, chromatic, quasi, fugue, where, the, parts, are, a, montage, of, melismatic, skipping, micropolyphony, and, the, dies, irae, dividing, the, latter, sequence, into, two, parts, de, die, judicii, and, lacrimosa, lux, aeterna, 1966, is, a, 16, voice, a, cappella, piece, whose, text, is, also, associated, with, the, latin, requiem, ligeti, s, cello, concerto, 1966, which, is, dedicated, to, siegfried, palm, is, composed, of, two, movements, the, first, begins, with, an, almost, imperceptible, cello, which, slowly, shifts, into, static, tone, clusters, with, the, orchestra, before, reaching, a, crescendo, and, slowly, decaying, while, the, second, is, a, virtuoso, piece, of, dynamic, atonal, melody, on, the, part, of, the, cello, lontano, 1967, for, full, orchestra, is, another, example, of, micropolyphony, but, the, overall, effect, is, closer, to, harmony, with, complex, woven, textures, and, opacity, of, the, sound, giving, rise, to, a, harmonious, effect, it, has, become, a, standard, repertoire, piece, string, quartet, no, 2, 1968, consists, of, five, movements, they, differ, widely, from, each, other, in, their, types, of, motion, in, the, first, the, structure, is, largely, broken, up, as, in, aventures, in, the, second, everything, is, reduced, to, very, slow, motion, and, the, music, seems, to, be, coming, from, a, distance, with, great, lyricism, the, pizzicato, third, movement, is, a, machine, like, studies, hard, and, mechanical, whereby, the, parts, playing, repeated, notes, create, a, granulated, continuum, in, the, fourth, which, is, fast, and, threatening, everything, that, happened, before, is, crammed, together, lastly, in, strong, contrast, the, fifth, movement, spreads, itself, out, in, each, movement, the, same, basic, configurations, return, but, each, time, their, colouring, or, viewpoint, is, different, so, that, the, overall, form, only, really, emerges, when, one, listens, to, all, five, movements, in, context, ramifications, 1968, 69, completed, a, year, before, the, chamber, concerto, is, scored, for, an, ensemble, of, strings, in, twelve, parts, seven, violins, two, violas, two, cellos, and, a, double, bass, each, of, which, may, be, taken, by, one, player, or, several, the, twelve, are, divided, into, two, numerically, equal, groups, but, with, the, instruments, in, the, first, group, tuned, approximately, a, quarter, tone, higher, four, violins, a, viola, and, a, cello, as, the, group, play, the, one, tuned, higher, inevitably, tends, to, slide, down, toward, the, other, and, both, get, nearer, each, other, in, pitch, in, the, chamber, concerto, 1969, 70, several, layers, processes, and, kinds, of, movement, can, take, place, on, different, planes, simultaneously, in, spite, of, frequent, markings, of, senza, tempo, the, instrumentalists, are, not, given, linear, freedom, ligeti, insists, on, keeping, his, texture, under, strict, control, at, any, given, moment, the, form, is, like, a, precision, mechanism, ligeti, was, always, fascinated, by, machines, that, do, not, work, properly, and, by, the, world, of, technology, and, automation, the, use, of, periodic, mechanical, noises, suggesting, not, quite, reliable, machinery, occurs, in, many, of, his, works, the, scoring, is, for, flute, doubling, piccolo, oboe, doubling, oboe, d, amore, and, cor, anglais, clarinet, bass, clarinet, doubling, second, clarinet, horn, trombone, harpsichord, doubling, hammond, organ, piano, doubling, celesta, and, solo, string, quintet, he, also, wrote, a, double, concerto, for, flute, oboe, orchestra, 1972, most, of, these, compositions, establish, timbre, rather, than, the, traditionally, favored, dimensions, of, pitch, and, rhythm, as, their, principal, formal, parameter, a, practice, that, has, come, to, be, known, as, sonorism, from, the, 1970s, ligeti, turned, away, from, sonorism, and, began, to, concentrate, on, rhythm, pieces, such, as, continuum, 1968, and, clocks, and, clouds, 1972, 73, were, written, before, he, heard, the, music, of, steve, reich, and, terry, riley, in, 1972, but, the, second, of, his, three, pieces, for, two, pianos, 1976, entitled, self, portrait, with, reich, and, riley, and, chopin, in, the, background, commemorates, this, affirmation, and, influence, during, the, 1970s, he, also, became, interested, in, the, polyphonic, pipe, music, of, the, banda, linda, tribe, from, the, central, african, republic, which, he, heard, through, the, recordings, of, one, of, his, students, in, 1977, ligeti, completed, his, only, opera, le, grand, macabre, thirteen, years, after, its, initial, commission, loosely, based, on, michel, de, ghelderode, s, 1934, play, la, balade, du, grand, macabre, it, is, a, work, of, absurd, theatre, ligeti, called, it, an, anti, anti, opera, in, which, death, nekrotzar, arrives, in, the, fictional, city, of, breughelland, and, announces, that, the, end, of, the, world, will, occur, at, midnight, musically, le, grand, macabre, draws, on, techniques, not, associated, with, ligeti, s, previous, work, including, quotations, and, pseudo, quotations, of, other, works, and, the, use, of, consonant, thirds, and, sixths, after, le, grand, macabre, ligeti, would, abandon, the, use, of, pastiche, but, would, increasingly, incorporate, consonant, harmonies, even, major, and, minor, triads, into, his, work, albeit, not, in, a, diatonic, context, after, le, grand, macabre, ligeti, struggled, for, some, time, to, find, a, new, style, besides, two, short, pieces, for, harpsichord, he, did, not, complete, another, major, work, until, the, trio, for, violin, horn, and, piano, in, 1982, over, four, years, after, the, opera, his, music, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, continued, to, emphasise, complex, mechanical, rhythms, often, in, a, less, densely, chromatic, idiom, tending, to, favour, displaced, major, and, minor, triads, and, polymodal, structures, during, this, time, ligeti, also, began, to, explore, alternate, tuning, systems, through, the, use, of, natural, harmonics, for, horns, as, in, the, horn, trio, and, piano, concerto, and, scordatura, for, strings, as, in, the, violin, concerto, additionally, most, of, his, works, in, this, period, are, multi, movement, works, rather, than, the, extended, single, movements, of, atmosph, res, and, san, francisco, polyphony, from, 1985, to, 2001, ligeti, completed, three, books, of, tudes, for, piano, book, i, 1985, book, ii, 1988, 94, book, iii, 1995, 2001, comprising, eighteen, compositions, in, all, the, tudes, draw, from, a, diverse, range, of, sources, including, gamelan, african, polyrhythms, b, la, bart, k, conlon, nancarrow, thelonious, monk, and, bill, evans, book, i, was, written, as, preparation, for, the, piano, concerto, which, contains, a, number, of, similar, motivic, and, melodic, elements, ligeti, s, music, from, the, last, two, decades, of, his, life, is, unmistakable, for, its, rhythmic, complexity, writing, about, his, first, book, of, piano, tudes, the, composer, claims, this, rhythmic, complexity, stems, from, two, vastly, different, sources, of, inspiration, the, romantic, era, piano, music, of, chopin, and, schumann, and, the, indigenous, music, of, sub, saharan, africa, the, difference, between, the, earlier, and, later, pieces, lies, in, a, new, conception, of, pulse, in, the, earlier, works, the, pulse, is, something, to, be, divided, into, two, three, and, so, on, the, effect, of, these, different, subdivisions, especially, when, they, occur, simultaneously, is, to, blur, the, aural, landscape, creating, the, micropolyphonic, effect, of, ligeti, s, music, on, the, other, hand, the, later, music, and, a, few, earlier, pieces, such, as, continuum, treats, the, pulse, as, a, musical, atom, a, common, denominator, a, basic, unit, which, cannot, be, divided, further, different, rhythms, appear, through, multiplications, of, the, basic, pulse, rather, than, divisions, this, is, the, principle, of, african, music, seized, on, by, ligeti, it, also, appears, in, the, music, of, philip, glass, steve, reich, and, others, and, significantly, it, shares, much, in, common, with, the, additive, rhythms, of, balkan, folk, music, the, music, of, ligeti, s, youth, he, described, the, music, of, conlon, nancarrow, with, its, extremely, complex, explorations, of, polyrhythmic, complexity, as, the, greatest, discovery, since, webern, and, ives, something, great, and, important, for, all, music, history, his, music, is, so, utterly, original, enjoyable, perfectly, constructed, but, at, the, same, time, emotional, for, me, it, s, the, best, music, of, any, composer, living, today, in, 1988, ligeti, completed, his, piano, concerto, writing, that, i, present, my, artistic, credo, in, the, piano, concerto, i, demonstrate, my, independence, from, criteria, of, the, traditional, avantgarde, as, well, as, the, fashionable, postmodernism, initial, sketches, of, the, concerto, began, in, 1980, but, it, was, not, until, 1985, that, he, found, a, way, forward, and, the, work, proceeded, more, quickly, the, concerto, explores, many, of, the, ideas, worked, out, in, the, tudes, but, in, an, orchestral, context, in, 1993, ligeti, completed, his, violin, concerto, after, four, years, of, work, like, the, piano, concerto, the, violin, concerto, uses, the, wide, range, of, techniques, he, had, developed, up, until, that, point, as, well, as, the, new, ideas, he, was, working, out, at, the, moment, among, other, techniques, it, uses, a, passacaglia, microtonality, rapidly, changing, textures, comic, juxtapositions, hungarian, folk, melodies, bulgarian, dance, rhythms, references, to, medieval, and, renaissance, music, and, solo, violin, writing, that, ranges, from, the, slow, paced, and, sweet, toned, to, the, angular, and, fiery, other, notable, works, from, this, period, are, the, viola, sonata, 1994, and, the, nonsense, madrigals, 1988, 93, a, set, of, six, a, cappella, compositions, that, set, english, texts, from, william, brighty, rands, lewis, carroll, and, heinrich, hoffman, the, third, madrigal, is, a, setting, of, the, english, alphabet, ligeti, s, last, works, were, the, hamburg, concerto, for, solo, horn, four, natural, horns, and, chamber, orchestra, 1998, 99, revised, 2003, dedicated, to, marie, luise, neunecker, the, song, cycle, s, ppal, dobbal, n, diheged, vel, with, pipes, drums, fiddles, 2000, and, the, eighteenth, piano, tude, canon, 2001, the, printed, score, and, the, manuscript, of, the, hamburg, concerto, contain, numerous, errors, and, inconsistencies, the, revision, of, the, piece, realized, by, the, italian, composer, alessio, elia, and, published, in, the, book, the, hamburgisches, konzert, by, gy, rgy, ligeti, published, by, edition, impronta, was, used, for, the, first, revised, performance, of, this, work, realized, by, the,
