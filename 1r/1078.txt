pachacuti, inca, yupanqui, also, called, pachac, tec, quechua, pachakutiy, inka, yupanki, was, the, ninth, sapa, inca, of, the, chiefdom, of, cusco, which, he, transformed, into, the, inca, empire, quechua, tawantinsuyu, most, archaeologists, now, believe, that, the, famous, inca, site, of, machu, picchu, was, built, as, an, estate, for, pachacuti, in, quechua, the, cosmogonical, concept, of, pachakutiy, means, the, turn, of, the, world, and, yupanki, could, mean, honorable, lord, during, his, reign, cusco, grew, from, a, hamlet, into, an, empire, that, could, compete, with, and, eventually, overtake, the, chim, empire, on, the, northern, coast, he, began, an, era, of, conquest, that, within, three, generations, expanded, the, inca, dominion, from, the, valley, of, cusco, to, a, sizeable, part, of, western, south, america, according, to, the, inca, chronicler, garcilaso, de, la, vega, pachacuti, created, the, inti, raymi, to, celebrate, the, new, year, in, the, andes, of, the, southern, hemisphere, pachacuti, is, often, linked, to, the, origin, and, expansion, of, the, inti, sun, cult, accessing, power, following, the, inca, chanka, war, pachacuti, conquered, territories, around, lake, titicaca, and, lake, poop, in, the, south, parts, of, the, eastern, slopes, of, the, andes, mountains, near, the, amazon, rainforest, in, the, east, lands, up, to, the, quito, basin, in, the, north, and, lands, from, tumbes, to, possibly, the, coastal, regions, from, nazca, and, caman, to, tarapac, these, conquests, were, achieved, with, the, help, of, many, military, commanders, and, they, initiated, inca, imperial, expansion, in, the, andes, pachacuti, is, considered, by, some, anthropologists, to, be, the, first, historical, emperor, of, the, incas, and, by, others, to, be, a, mythological, and, cosmological, representation, of, the, beginning, of, the, era, of, inca, imperial, expansion, the, compound, pachacuti, referred, to, an, ancient, andean, cosmological, concept, representing, cataclysmic, change, of, era, worlds, the, anthroponym, appeared, written, as, pachacuti, or, pachacute, in, the, early, colonial, chronicles, and, documents, of, the, 16th, century, this, written, form, can, be, reconstructed, into, quechua, as, pacha, kutiy, the, form, pachac, tec, contemporary, quechua, spelling, pachakutiq, was, introduced, by, the, writer, inca, garcilaso, de, la, vega, in, his, comentarios, reales, de, los, incas, published, in, 1609, before, the, coronation, pachacuti, was, referred, to, as, inga, yupangui, with, the, spanish, navigator, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, additionally, claiming, pachcuti, s, first, name, was, cusi, the, compound, is, not, influenced, by, other, languages, such, as, aymara, or, puquina, and, is, considered, purely, quechua, it, is, composed, of, the, noun, pacha, which, means, land, region, time, world, and, represents, an, andean, concept, associating, time, with, the, physical, world, and, the, verb, kuti, to, change, turn, return, to, a, starting, point, the, apparent, absence, of, a, nominalization, mark, is, attributed, to, the, spanish, colonial, scribes, failure, to, recognize, the, presence, of, an, y, action, nominalizer, consequently, kuti, y, means, change, turn, return, the, colonial, chronicler, juan, de, betanzos, translated, the, anthroponym, pacha, kutiy, as, turn, of, time, and, the, peruvian, linguist, rodolfo, cerr, n, palomino, translated, the, compound, as, the, turn, of, the, world, the, form, pachacutec, used, in, garcilaso, de, la, vega, s, writing, likely, was, caused, by, the, incas, storing, of, the, agent, nominalizer, q, instead, of, the, action, nominalizer, y, in, quechua, the, presence, of, an, uvular, consonant, such, as, q, causes, the, vowel, to, be, pronounced, as, an, e, in, spanish, however, garcilaso, s, restitution, contradicted, early, colonial, documentation, and, was, grammatically, implausible, since, the, verb, kuti, is, an, intransitive, verb, and, the, chronicler, s, intended, meaning, for, the, word, of, he, who, goes, around, the, world, required, an, additional, morpheme, altering, the, verbal, valence, the, form, pachacutec, pacha, kuti, q, reconstructed, by, garcilaso, was, ungrammatical, in, quechua, and, the, meaning, of, he, who, goes, around, the, world, would, have, instead, required, an, expression, similar, to, pacha, kuti, chi, q, according, to, the, oral, tradition, of, pachacuti, s, imperial, lineage, the, name, was, acquired, following, the, war, against, the, chankas, according, to, the, chronicler, juan, de, betanzos, version, together, with, the, names, or, epithets, c, pac, and, indichuri, pachacuti, is, often, considered, the, first, historical, incan, emperor, despite, various, mythological, elements, various, historians, associated, pachacuti, with, the, rewriting, of, the, previous, inca, rulers, reigns, in, order, to, justify, incan, imperial, expansion, the, nature, of, pachacuti, s, tale, the, cosmological, concepts, and, meanings, decipherable, from, it, and, the, lack, of, physical, representations, as, well, archeological, evidence, occasionally, refuting, the, history, of, his, reign, as, presented, by, colonial, sources, contradicted, his, historical, image, and, made, some, scholars, come, to, the, conclusion, that, pachacuti, was, an, incan, ideological, and, cosmological, concept, the, linguists, anthropologists, archeologists, ethnologists, and, historians, martti, p, rssinen, catherine, julien, rodolfo, cerr, n, palomino, alfred, m, traux, brian, s, bauer, john, howland, rowe, franck, salomon, waldemar, espinoza, soriano, jos, antonio, del, busto, duthurburu, gary, urton, and, mar, a, rostworowski, consider, pachacuti, to, be, historical, while, others, such, as, pierre, duviols, juan, ossio, acu, a, reiner, tom, zuidema, franck, garcia, and, carmen, bernand, consider, pachacuti, to, be, mythological, or, mytho, historical, according, to, the, archeologist, franck, garcia, the, story, of, pachacuti, s, reign, was, mainly, symbolical, and, served, to, set, philosophical, principles, inca, history, having, the, structural, elements, of, a, myth, john, howland, rowe, analyzed, and, compared, various, colonial, sources, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, there, existed, a, state, sanctioned, standard, history, believing, pachacuti, s, victory, over, the, chanka, people, to, be, the, cause, of, imperial, expansion, in, 1953, mar, a, rostworowski, published, her, biography, of, pachacuti, the, first, modern, biography, of, an, exclusively, pre, columbian, figure, and, supported, rowe, s, conclusion, of, late, imperial, expansion, under, pachacuti, the, dutch, structuralist, anthropologist, reiner, tom, zuidema, criticized, rowe, and, rostworowski, for, methodological, practices, and, studied, the, symbolical, cosmological, territorial, organization, of, the, administration, and, of, cusco, and, it, s, surroundings, examining, the, dualist, philosophy, of, the, andes, yanantin, zuidema, and, pierre, duviols, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, inca, empire, was, a, diarchy, pachacuti, having, co, reigned, according, to, them, with, the, warrior, chieftain, mayta, capac, the, fourth, ruler, of, cusco, in, the, traditional, list, while, martti, p, rssinen, examining, andean, tripartite, traditions, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, internal, organization, of, the, capital, cusco, had, three, rulers, the, co, rulers, of, pachacuti, being, capac, yupanqui, and, mayta, capac, while, the, state, wide, imperial, administration, had, only, one, in, 1945, rowe, devised, an, imperial, chronology, stating, pachacuti, reigned, from, 1438, to, 1471, while, archeological, data, suggests, the, early, 15th, century, to, be, the, beginning, of, pachacuti, s, reign, the, former, minister, of, culture, juan, ossio, acu, a, supported, the, position, of, zuidema, who, postulated, that, the, inca, rulers, before, topa, inca, yupanqui, including, pachacuti, weren, t, historical, rulers, but, rather, social, groups, or, factions, pachacuti, s, given, name, was, cusi, yupanqui, and, he, originated, from, the, female, lineage, of, i, aca, panaka, in, the, moiety, of, hanan, cusco, high, cusco, in, complementary, opposition, to, the, moiety, of, hurin, cusco, low, cusco, according, to, the, accounts, of, the, spanish, chroniclers, he, was, the, son, of, the, eighth, ruler, of, cusco, inca, viracocha, whose, lineage, panaka, however, was, sucsu, panaka, analyzing, the, colonial, writings, the, historian, and, anthropologist, mar, a, rostworowski, concluded, that, based, on, andean, traditions, of, succession, which, allowed, for, the, most, capable, to, take, power, pachacuti, was, not, the, son, of, inca, viracocha, rendering, him, illegitimate, in, the, eyes, of, the, spaniards, who, believed, in, european, concepts, of, primogeniture, cusi, yupanqui, was, born, in, cusco, at, the, palace, of, cusicancha, bordering, the, inticancha, temple, his, tutor, micuymana, taught, him, history, laws, and, language, as, well, as, the, handling, of, quipus, from, a, young, age, he, was, admired, by, inca, nobles, because, he, had, the, courage, intelligence, and, maturity, his, brother, inca, urco, the, appointed, co, ruler, and, heir, to, the, throne, lacked, similarly, he, showed, aptitudes, for, government, and, conquest, that, his, brother, likewise, lacked, the, generals, of, viracocha, started, fomenting, conspiracies, to, overthrow, and, replace, inca, urco, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, cusco, confederation, stretching, 40, kilometers, around, the, city, of, cusco, faced, an, invasion, by, the, chankas, the, incas, traditional, tribal, archenemies, multiple, versions, of, the, encounter, exist, the, most, accepted, one, being, supported, by, the, majority, of, reliable, spanish, sources, the, ruler, inca, viracocha, and, his, co, ruler, urco, fled, the, scene, while, cusi, yupanqui, rallied, the, army, accompanied, by, four, of, viracocha, s, generals, and, prepared, the, defense, of, the, city, during, the, subsequent, assault, on, cusco, the, chankas, were, repelled, so, severely, that, legend, tells, even, the, stones, rose, up, to, fight, on, yupanqui, s, side, at, the, battle, of, yahuar, pampa, the, inka, army, won, a, decisive, victory, over, the, chankas, and, asserted, it, s, dominance, cusi, yupanqui, captured, many, chanka, leaders, who, he, presented, to, his, father, viracocha, for, him, to, wipe, his, feet, on, their, bodies, a, traditional, victory, ritual, viracocha, told, yupanqui, that, the, honor, of, the, ritual, belonged, to, the, designated, heir, urco, yupanqui, protested, and, said, that, he, had, not, won, the, victory, for, his, brothers, to, step, on, the, chanka, captives, a, heated, argument, ensued, and, viracocha, tried, to, have, the, general, assassinated, pachacuti, was, tipped, off, to, the, plot, however, and, the, assassination, failed, viracocha, went, into, exile, while, inca, yupanqui, returned, in, triumph, to, cusco, and, following, a, short, civil, war, during, which, the, co, ruler, urco, died, was, crowned, sapa, inca, of, cusco, and, renamed, himself, pachacuti, meaning, earth, shaker, as, ruler, pachacuti, married, mama, anawarkhi, of, the, ayllus, of, choqo, and, cachona, most, likely, to, reward, a, chief, belonging, to, one, of, these, ayllus, who, had, defended, cusco, during, the, chanka, invasion, and, left, his, original, family, clan, panaka, to, form, the, imperial, lineage, of, hatun, ayllu, failing, in, his, attempt, to, fuse, the, two, factions, to, record, the, history, of, the, previous, inca, rulers, of, cusco, pachacuti, ordered, the, creation, of, painted, wooden, panels, which, in, relation, to, oral, texts, often, in, the, form, of, mnemonic, songs, sung, at, important, celebrations, and, quipus, which, contained, simple, and, stereotyped, information, according, to, colour, order, and, number, decipherable, by, quipucamayocs, represented, official, and, state, sanctioned, pre, imperial, history, despite, pachacuti, s, prestige, following, the, victory, over, the, chankas, he, had, little, effective, power, and, a, meager, work, force, to, undertake, the,

gifts, including, the, booty, of, the, war, against, the, chankas, before, articulating, gradually, growing, demands, such, as, the, construction, of, warehouses, the, stocking, of, produce, the, creation, of, an, army, and, the, improvement, of, infrastructure, using, the, means, of, reciprocity, pachacuti, rebuilt, much, of, cusco, designing, it, to, serve, the, needs, of, an, imperial, city, and, as, a, representation, of, the, empire, each, suyu, had, a, sector, of, the, city, centering, on, the, road, leading, to, that, province, nobles, and, immigrants, lived, in, the, sector, corresponding, to, their, origin, each, sector, was, further, divided, into, areas, for, the, hanan, upper, and, hurin, lower, moieties, many, of, the, most, renowned, monuments, around, cusco, such, as, the, great, sun, temple, qurikancha, previously, intikancha, were, rebuilt, during, pachacuti, s, reign, at, the, beginning, of, pachacuti, s, reign, the, cult, of, the, andean, creator, deity, viracocha, whose, priests, had, supported, the, previous, ruler, viracocha, inca, was, possibly, replaced, by, the, inti, sun, cult, the, first, months, of, his, reign, were, spent, putting, down, revolts, by, surrounding, chiefs, in, the, cusco, valley, and, consolidating, the, territorial, base, of, the, polity, confronting, the, ayarmacas, the, ollantaytambo, the, huacara, and, the, toguaro,

recognized, pachacuti, s, superiority, however, in, 1945, the, historian, john, howland, rowe, attributed, the, conquest, to, later, rulers, claiming, that, the, initial, campaign, was, a, raid, pachacuti, started, the, practice, of, forced, migrations, sending, mitimaes, colonists, of, loyal, areas, to, unstable, provinces, or, alternatively, placing, loyal, peoples, to, strategic, positions, in, the, empire, as, part, of, his, vision, of, a, statesman, and, warrior, chieftain, he, conquered, many, ethnic, groups, and, states, highlighting, his, conquest, of, the, collao, that, enhanced, the, prestige, of, the, inca, pachacuti, due, to, the, remarkable, expansion, of, their, domains, he, was, considered, an, exceptional, leader, enlivening, glorious, epic, stories, and, hymns, in, tribute, to, his, achievements, numerous, kurakas, do, not, hesitate, to, recognise, his, skills, and, identify, him, as, the, son, of, the, sun, according, to, various, historians, and, anthropologists, pachacuti, initiated, the, pax, incaica, or, inca, peace, notably, by, imposing, peace, to, the, regional, chiefdoms, that, comprised, the, alliance, of, structures, united, around, the, figure, of, the, inca, emperor, called, tawantinsuyu, or, inca, empire, the, colla, chiefdom, and, the, lupaca, chiefdom, of, lake, titicaca, in, the, altiplano, called, collao, were, one, of,

empire, under, pachacuti, to, have, reached, the, desaguadero, river, near, lake, titicaca, which, marked, the, border, between, the, conquered, lupaca, chiefdom, and, the, pacasa, chiefdom, however, in, 1992, the, finnish, ethno, historian, martti, p, rssinen, pointing, to, local, sources, of, the, area, of, the, aymara, kingdoms, supported, the, narrative, of, territorial, expansion, by,

hospices, the, road, of, the, inca, qhapaq, an, stretched, from, quito, to, chile, pachacuti, is, also, credited, with, having, displaced, hundreds, of, thousands, in, massive, programs, of, relocation, and, resettling, them, to, colonize, the, most, remote, edges, of, his, empire, these, forced, colonists, called, mitimaes, represented, the, lowest, place, in, the, incan, social, hierarchy, despite, his, political, and, military, talents, pachacuti, did, not, improve, the, system, of, succession, his, son, became, the, next, inca, without, any, recorded, dispute, after, pachacuti, died, in, 1471, due, to, a, terminal, illness, even, though, some, colonial, sources, hint, at, pachacuti, s, abdication, prior, to, his, death, but, in, future, generations, the, next, inca, had, to, gain, control, of, the, empire, by, winning, enough, support, from, the, apos, priesthood, and, military, to, win, a, civil, war, or, intimidate, anyone, else, from, trying, to, wrest, control, of, the, empire, pachacuti, was, a, poet, and, the, author, of, the, sacred, hymns, of, the, situa, city, purification, ceremony, pedro, sarmiento, de, gamboa, attributed, one, song, to, pachacuti, on, his, deathbed, i, was, born, as, a, lily, in, the, garden, and, like, the, lily, i, grew, as, my, age, advanced, i, became, old, and, had, to, die, and, so, i, withered, and, died,
