political, climate, following, the, scottish, reformation, that, mary, encountered, on, her, return, to, scotland, was, further, agitated, by, prominent, scots, such, as, john, knox, who, openly,

scotland, when, her, father, died, perhaps, from, the, effects, of, a, nervous, collapse, following, the, battle, of, solway, moss, or, from, drinking, contaminated, water, while, on, campaign, a, popular, tale, first, recorded, by, john, knox, states, that, james, upon, hearing, on, his, deathbed, that, his, wife, had, given, birth, to, a, daughter, ruefully, exclaimed, it, cam, wi, a, lass, and, it, will, gang, wi, a, lass, his, house, of, stuart, had, gained, the, throne, of, scotland, in, the, 14th, century, through, a, lass, via, the, marriage, of, marjorie, bruce, daughter, of, robert, the, bruce, to, walter, stewart, 6th, high, steward, of, scotland, and, it, would, be, lost, from, his, family, wi, a, lass, this, legendary, statement, came, true, much, later, not, through,

the, throne, beaton, s, claim, was, based, on, a, version, of, the, king, s, will, that, his, opponents, dismissed, as, a, forgery, arran, with, the, support, of, his, friends, and, relations, became, the, regent, until, 1554, when, mary, s, mother, managed, to, remove, and, succeed, him, king, henry, viii, of, england, took, the, opportunity, of, the, regency, to, propose, marriage, between, mary,

hair, hazel, brown, eyes, under, heavy, lowered, eyelids, and, finely, arched, brows, smooth, pale, skin, a, high, forehead, and, regular, firm, features, she, was, considered, a, pretty, child, and, later, as, a, woman, strikingly, attractive, at, some, point, in, her, infancy, or, childhood, she, caught, smallpox, but, it, did, not, mark, her, features, mary, was, eloquent, and, especially, tall, by, 16th, century, standards, she, attained, an, adult, height, of, 5, feet, 11, inches, or, 1, 80, m, while, henry, ii, s, son, and, heir, francis, stuttered, and, was, unusually, short, henry, commented, from, the, very, first, day, they, met, my, son, and, she, got, on, as, well, together, as, if, they, had, known, each, other, for, a, long, time, on, 4, april, 1558, mary, signed, a,

the, third, succession, act, passed, in, 1543, by, the, parliament, of, england, elizabeth, was, recognised, as, her, sister, s, heir, and, henry, viii, s, last, will, and, testament, had, excluded, the, stuarts, from, succeeding, to, the, english, throne, yet, in, the, eyes, of, many, catholics, elizabeth, was, illegitimate, and, mary, stuart, was, the, rightful, queen, of, england, as, the, senior, surviving, legitimate, descendant, of, henry, vii, through, her, grandmother, margaret, tudor, henry, ii, of, france, proclaimed, his, eldest, son, and, daughter, in, law, king, and, queen, of, england, in, france, the, royal, arms, of, england, were, quartered, with, those, of, francis, and, mary, mary, s, claim, to, the, english, throne, was, a, perennial, sticking, point, between, her, and, elizabeth, when, henry, ii, died, on, 10, july, 1559, from, injuries, sustained, in, a, joust, fifteen, year, old, francis, and, sixteen, year, old, mary, became, king, and, queen, of, france, two, of, the, queen, s, uncles, the, duke, of, guise, and, the, cardinal, of, lorraine, were, now, dominant, in, french, politics, enjoying, an, ascendancy, called, by, some, historians, la, tyrannie, guisienne, in, scotland, the, power, of, the, protestant, lords, of, the, congregation, was, rising, at, the, expense, of, mary, s, mother, who, maintained, effective, control, only, through, the, use, of, french, troops, in, early, 1560, the, protestant, lords, invited, english, troops, into, scotland, in, an, attempt, to, secure, protestantism, a, huguenot, uprising, in, france, the, tumult, of, amboise, made, it, impossible, for, the, french, to, send, further, support, instead, the, guise, brothers, sent, ambassadors, to, negotiate, a, settlement, on, 11, june, 1560, their, sister, mary, s, mother, died, and, so, the, question, of, future, franco, scots, relations, was, a, pressing, one, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, edinburgh, signed, by, mary, s, representatives, on, 6, july, 1560, france, and, england, undertook, to, withdraw, troops, from, scotland, france, recognised, elizabeth, s, right, to, rule, england, but, the, seventeen, year, old, mary, still, in, france, and, grieving, for, her, mother, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, king, francis, ii, died, on, 5, december, 1560, of, a, middle, ear, infection, that, led, to, an, abscess, in, his, brain, mary, was, grief, stricken, her, mother, in, law, catherine, de, medici, became, regent, for, the, late, king, s, ten, year, old, brother, charles, ix, who, inherited, the, french, throne, mary, returned, to, scotland, nine, months, later, arriving, in, leith, on, 19, august, 1561, having, lived, in, france, since, the, age, of, five, mary, had, little, direct, experience, of, the, dangerous, and, complex, political, situation, in, scotland, as, a, devout, catholic, she, was, regarded, with, suspicion, by, many, of, her, subjects, as, well, as, by, the, queen, of, england, scotland, was, torn, between, catholic, and, protestant, factions, mary, s, illegitimate, half, brother, the, earl, of, moray, was, a, leader, of, the, protestants, the, protestant, reformer, john, knox, preached, against, mary, condemning, her, for, hearing, mass, dancing, and, dressing, too, elaborately, she, summoned, him, to, her, presence, to, remonstrate, with, him, but, was, unsuccessful, she, later, charged, him, with, treason, but, he, was, acquitted, and, released, to, the, surprise, and, dismay, of, the, catholic, party, mary, tolerated, the, newly, established, protestant, ascendancy, and, kept, her, half, brother, moray, as, her, chief, advisor, her, privy, council, of, 16, men, appointed, on, 6, september, 1561, retained, those, who, already, held, the, offices, of, state, the, council, was, dominated, by, the, protestant, leaders, from, the, reformation, crisis, of, 1559, 1560, the, earls, of, argyll, glencairn, and, moray, only, four, of, the, councillors, were, catholic, the, earls, of, atholl, erroll, montrose, and, huntly, who, was, lord, chancellor, modern, historian, jenny, wormald, found, this, remarkable, and, suggested, that, mary, s, failure, to, appoint, a, council, sympathetic, to, catholic, and, french, interests, was, an, indication, of, her, focus, on, the, english, throne, over, the, internal, problems, of, scotland, even, the, one, significant, later, addition, to, the, council, lord, ruthven, in, december, 1563, was, another, protestant, whom, mary, personally, disliked, in, this, she, was, acknowledging, her, lack, of, effective, military, power, in, the, face, of, the, protestant, lords, while, also, following, a, policy, that, strengthened, her, links, with, england, she, joined, with, moray, in, the, destruction, of, scotland, s, leading, catholic, magnate, lord, huntly, in, 1562, after, he, led, a, rebellion, against, her, in, the, highlands, mary, sent, william, maitland, of, lethington, as, an, ambassador, to, the, english, court, to, put, the, case, for, mary, as, the, heir, presumptive, to, the, english, throne, elizabeth, refused, to, name, a, potential, heir, fearing, that, would, invite, conspiracy, to, displace, her, with, the, nominated, successor, however, she, assured, maitland, that, she, knew, no, one, with, a, better, claim, than, mary, in, late, 1561, and, early, 1562, arrangements, were, made, for, the, two, queens, to, meet, in, england, at, york, or, nottingham, in, august, or, september, 1562, in, july, elizabeth, sent, sir, henry, sidney, to, cancel, mary, s, visit, because, of, the, civil, war, in, france, mary, then, turned, her, attention, to, finding, a, new, husband, from, the, royalty, of, europe, when, her, uncle, the, cardinal, of, lorraine, began, negotiations, with, archduke, charles, of, austria, without, her, consent, she, angrily, objected, and, the, negotiations, foundered, her, own, attempt, to, negotiate, a, marriage, to, don, carlos, the, mentally, unstable, heir, apparent, of, king, philip, ii, of, spain, was, rebuffed, by, philip, elizabeth, attempted, to, neutralise, mary, by, suggesting, that, she, marry, english, protestant, robert, dudley, 1st, earl, of, leicester, dudley, was, sir, henry, sidney, s, brother, in, law, and, the, english, queen, s, own, favourite, whom, elizabeth, trusted, and, thought, she, could, control, she, sent, an, ambassador, thomas, randolph, to, tell, mary, that, if, she, married, an, english, nobleman, elizabeth, would, proceed, to, the, inquisition, of, her, right, and, title, to, be, our, next, cousin, and, heir, the, proposal, came, to, nothing, not, least, because, the, intended, bridegroom, was, unwilling, in, contrast, a, french, poet, at, mary, s, court, pierre, de, boscosel, de, chastelard, was, apparently, besotted, with, mary, in, early, 1563, he, was, discovered, during, a, security, search, hidden, underneath, her, bed, apparently, planning, to, surprise, her, when, she, was, alone, and, declare, his, love, for, her, mary, was, horrified, and, banished, him, from, scotland, he, ignored, the, edict, two, days, later, he, forced, his, way, into, her, chamber, as, she, was, about, to, disrobe, she, reacted, with, fury, and, fear, when, moray, rushed, into, the, room, after, hearing, her, cries, for, help, she, shouted, thrust, your, dagger, into, the, villain, moray, refused, as, chastelard, was, already, under, restraint, chastelard, was, tried, for, treason, and, beheaded, maitland, claimed, that, chastelard, s, ardour, was, feigned, and, that, he, was, part, of, a, huguenot, plot, to, discredit, mary, by, tarnishing, her, reputation, mary, had, briefly, met, her, english, born, half, cousin, henry, stuart, lord, darnley, in, february, 1561, when, she, was, in, mourning, for, francis, darnley, s, parents, the, earl, and, countess, of, lennox, were, scottish, aristocrats, as, well, as, english, landowners, they, sent, him, to, france, ostensibly, to, extend, their, condolences, while, hoping, for, a, potential, match, between, their, son, and, mary, both, mary, and, darnley, were, grandchildren, of, margaret, tudor, sister, of, henry, viii, of, england, and, patrilineal, descendants, of, the, high, stewards, of, scotland, darnley, shared, a, more, recent, stewart, lineage, with, the, hamilton, family, as, a, descendant, of, mary, stewart, countess, of, arran, a, daughter, of, james, ii, of, scotland, they, next, met, on, saturday, 17, february, 1565, at, wemyss, castle, in, scotland, mary, fell, in, love, with, the, long, lad, as, queen, elizabeth, called, him, since, he, was, over, six, feet, tall, they, married, at, holyrood, palace, on, 29, july, 1565, even, though, both, were, catholic, and, a, papal, dispensation, for, the, marriage, of, first, cousins, had, not, been, obtained, english, statesmen, william, cecil, and, the, earl, of, leicester, had, worked, to, obtain, darnley, s, licence, to, travel, to, scotland, from, his, home, in, england, although, her, advisors, had, brought, the, couple, together, elizabeth, felt, threatened, by, the, marriage, because, as, descendants, of, her, aunt, both, mary, and, darnley, were, claimants, to, the, english, throne, their, children, if, any, would, inherit, an, even, stronger, combined, claim, mary, s, insistence, on, the, marriage, seems, to, have, stemmed, from, passion, rather, than, calculation, the, english, ambassador, nicholas, throckmorton, stated, the, saying, is, that, surely, she, is, bewitched, adding, that, the, marriage, could, only, be, averted, by, violence, the, union, infuriated, elizabeth, who, felt, the, marriage, should, not, have, gone, ahead, without, her, permission, as, darnley, was, both, her, cousin, and, an, english, subject, mary, s, marriage, to, a, leading, catholic, precipitated, mary, s, half, brother, the, earl, of, moray, to, join, with, other, protestant, lords, including, lords, argyll, and, glencairn, in, open, rebellion, mary, set, out, from, edinburgh, on, 26, august, 1565, to, confront, them, on, the, 30th, moray, entered, edinburgh, but, left, soon, afterwards, having, failed, to, take, the, castle, mary, returned, to, edinburgh, the, following, month, to, raise, more, troops, in, what, became, known, as, the, chaseabout, raid, mary, with, her, forces, and, moray, with, the, rebellious, lords, roamed, around, scotland, without, ever, engaging, in, direct, combat, mary, s, numbers, were, boosted, by, the, release, and, restoration, to, favour, of, lord, huntly, s, son, and, the, return, of, james, hepburn, 4th, earl, of, bothwell, from, exile, in, france, unable, to, muster, sufficient, support, moray, left, scotland, in, october, for, asylum, in, england, mary, broadened, her, privy, council, bringing, in, both, catholics, bishop, of, ross, john, lesley, and, provost, of, edinburgh, simon, preston, of, craigmillar, and, protestants, the, new, lord, huntly, bishop, of, galloway, alexander, gordon, john, maxwell, of, terregles, and, sir, james, balfour, before, long, darnley, grew, arrogant, not, content, with, his, position, as, king, consort, he, demanded, the, crown, matrimonial, which, would, have, made, him, a, co, sovereign, of, scotland, with, the, right, to, keep, the, scottish, throne, for, himself, if, he, outlived, his, wife, mary, refused, his, request, and, their, marriage, grew, strained, although, they, conceived, by, october, 1565, he, was, jealous, of, her, friendship, with, her, catholic, private, secretary, david, rizzio, who, was, rumoured, to, be, the, father, of, her, child, by, march, 1566, darnley, had, entered, into, a, secret, conspiracy, with, protestant, lords, including, the, nobles, who, had, rebelled, against, mary, in, the, chaseabout, raid, on, 9, march, a, group, of, the, conspirators, accompanied, by, darnley, stabbed, rizzio, to, death, in, front, of, the, pregnant, mary, at, a, dinner, party, in, holyrood, palace, over, the, next, two, days, a, disillusioned, darnley, switched, sides, and, mary, received, moray, at, holyrood, on, the, night, of, 11, 12, march, darnley, and, mary, escaped, from, the, palace, they, took, temporary, refuge, in, dunbar, castle, before, returning, to, edinburgh, on, 18, march, the, former, rebels, lords, moray, argyll, and, glencairn, were, restored, to, the, council, mary, s, son, by, darnley, james, was, born, on, 19, june, 1566, in, edinburgh, castle, however, the, murder, of, rizzio, led, to, the, breakdown, of, her, marriage, in, october, 1566, while, staying, at, jedburgh, in, the, scottish, borders, mary, made, a, journey, on, horseback, of, at, least, four, hours, each, way, to, visit, the, earl, of, bothwell, at, hermitage, castle, where, he, lay, ill, from, wounds, sustained, in, a, skirmish, with, john, elliot, of, park, the, ride, was, later, used, as, evidence, by, mary, s, enemies, that, the, two, were, lovers, though, no, suspicions, were, voiced, at, the, time, and, mary, had, been, accompanied, by, her, councillors, and, guards, immediately, after, her, return, to, jedburgh, she, suffered, a, serious, illness, that, included, frequent, vomiting, loss, of, sight, loss, of, speech, convulsions, and, periods, of, unconsciousness, she, was, thought, to, be, dying, her, recovery, from, 25, october, onwards, was, credited, to, the, skill, of, her, french, physicians, the, cause, of, her, illness, is, unknown, potential, diagnoses, include, physical, exhaustion, and, mental, stress, haemorrhage, of, a, gastric, ulcer, and, porphyria, at, craigmillar, castle, near, edinburgh, at, the, end, of, november, 1566, mary, and, leading, nobles, held, a, meeting, to, discuss, the, problem, of, darnley, divorce, was, discussed, but, a, bond, was, probably, sworn, between, the, lords, present, to, remove, darnley, by, other, means, it, was, thought, expedient, and, most, profitable, for, the, common, wealth, that, such, a, young, fool, and, proud, tyrant, should, not, reign, or, bear, rule, over, them, that, he, should, be, put, off, by, one, way, or, another, and, whosoever, should, take, the, deed, in, hand, or, do, it, they, should, defend, darnley, feared, for, his, safety, and, after, the, baptism, of, his, son, at, stirling, and, shortly, before, christmas, he, went, to, glasgow, to, stay, on, his, father, s, estates, at, the, start, of, the, journey, he, was, afflicted, by, a, fever, possibly, smallpox, syphilis, or, the, result, of, poison, he, remained, ill, for, some, weeks, in, late, january, 1567, mary, prompted, her, husband, to, return, to, edinburgh, he, recuperated, from, his, illness, in, a, house, belonging, to, the, brother, of, sir, james, balfour, at, the, former, abbey, of, kirk, o, field, just, within, the, city, wall, mary, visited, him, daily, so, that, it, appeared, a, reconciliation, was, in, progress, on, the, night, of, 9, 10, february, 1567, mary, visited, her, husband, in, the, early, evening, and, then, attended, the, wedding, celebrations, of, a, member, of, her, household, bastian, pagez, in, the, early, hours, of, the, morning, an, explosion, devastated, kirk, o, field, darnley, was, found, dead, in, the, garden, apparently, smothered, there, were, no, visible, marks, of, strangulation, or, violence, on, the, body, bothwell, moray, secretary, maitland, the, earl, of, morton, and, mary, herself, were, among, those, who, came, under, suspicion, elizabeth, wrote, to, mary, of, the, rumours, i, should, ill, fulfil, the, office, of, a, faithful, cousin, or, an, affectionate, friend, if, i, did, not, tell, you, what, all, the, world, is, thinking, men, say, that, instead, of, seizing, the, murderers, you, are, looking, through, your, fingers, while, they, escape, that, you, will, not, seek, revenge, on, those, who, have, done, you, so, much, pleasure, as, though, the, deed, would, never, have, taken, place, had, not, the, doers, of, it, been, assured, of, impunity, for, myself, i, beg, you, to, believe, that, i, would, not, harbour, such, a, thought, by, the, end, of, february, bothwell, was, generally, believed, to, be, guilty, of, darnley, s, assassination, lennox, darnley, s, father, demanded, that, bothwell, be, tried, before, the, estates, of, parliament, to, which, mary, agreed, but, lennox, s, request, for, a, delay, to, gather, evidence, was, denied, in, the, absence, of, lennox, and, with, no, evidence, presented, bothwell, was, acquitted, after, a, seven, hour, trial, on, 12, april, a, week, later, bothwell, managed, to, convince, more, than, two, dozen, lords, and, bishops, to, sign, the, ainslie, tavern, bond, in, which, they, agreed, to, support, his, aim, to, marry, the, queen, between, 21, and, 23, april, 1567, mary, visited, her, son, at, stirling, for, the, last, time, on, her, way, back, to, edinburgh, on, 24, april, mary, was, abducted, willingly, or, not, by, lord, bothwell, and, his, men, and, taken, to, dunbar, castle, where, he, may, have, raped, her, on, 6, may, mary, and, bothwell, returned, to, edinburgh, on, 15, may, at, either, holyrood, palace, or, holyrood, abbey, they, were, married, according, to, protestant, rites, bothwell, and, his, first, wife, jean, gordon, who, was, the, sister, of, lord, huntly, had, divorced, twelve, days, previously, originally, mary, believed, that, many, nobles, supported, her, marriage, but, relations, quickly, soured, between, the, newly, elevated, bothwell, created, duke, of, orkney, and, his, former, peers, and, the, marriage, proved, to, be, deeply, unpopular, catholics, considered, the, marriage, unlawful, since, they, did, not, recognise, bothwell, s, divorce, or, the, validity, of, the, protestant, service, both, protestants, and, catholics, were, shocked, that, mary, should, marry, the, man, accused, of, murdering, her, husband, the, marriage, was, tempestuous, and, mary, became, despondent, twenty, six, scottish, peers, known, as, the, confederate, lords, turned, against, mary, and, bothwell, and, raised, their, own, army, mary, and, bothwell, confronted, the, lords, at, carberry, hill, on, 15, june, but, there, was, no, battle, as, mary, s, forces, dwindled, away, through, desertion, during, negotiations, bothwell, was, given, safe, passage, from, the, field, the, lords, took, mary, to, edinburgh, where, crowds, of, spectators, denounced, her, as, an, adulteress, and, murderer, the, following, night, she, was, imprisoned, in, lochleven, castle, on, an, island, in, the, middle, of, loch, leven, between, 20, and, 23, july, mary, miscarried, twins, on, 24, july, she, was, forced, to, abdicate, in, favour, of, her, one, year, old, son, james, moray, was, made, regent, while, bothwell, was, driven, into, exile, he, was, imprisoned, in, denmark, became, insane, and, died, in, 1578, on, 2, may, 1568, mary, escaped, from, lochleven, castle, with, the, aid, of, george, douglas, brother, of, sir, william, douglas, the, castle, s, owner, managing, to, raise, an, army, of, 6, 000, men, she, met, moray, s, smaller, forces, at, the, battle, of, langside, on, 13, may, defeated, she, fled, south, after, spending, the, night, at, dundrennan, abbey, she, crossed, the, solway, firth, into, england, by, fishing, boat, on, 16, may, she, landed, at, workington, in, cumberland, in, the, north, of, england, and, stayed, overnight, at, workington, hall, on, 18, may, local, officials, took, her, into, protective, custody, at, carlisle, castle, mary, apparently, expected, elizabeth, to, help, her, regain, her, throne, elizabeth, was, cautious, ordering, an, inquiry, into, the, conduct, of, the, confederate, lords, and, the, question, of, whether, mary, was, guilty, of, darnley, s, murder, in, mid, july, 1568, english, authorities, moved, mary, to, bolton, castle, because, it, was, farther, from, the, scottish, border, but, not, too, close, to, london, mary, s, clothes, sent, from, lochleven, castle, arrived, on, 20, july, a, commission, of, inquiry, or, conference, as, it, was, known, was, held, in, york, and, later, westminster, between, october, 1568, and, january, 1569, in, scotland, her, supporters, fought, a, civil, war, against, regent, moray, and, his, successors, as, an, anointed, queen, mary, refused, to, acknowledge, the, power, of, any, court, to, try, her, she, refused, to, attend, the, inquiry, at, york, personally, but, sent, representatives, elizabeth, forbade, her, attendance, anyway, as, evidence, against, mary, moray, presented, the, so, called, casket, letters, eight, unsigned, letters, purportedly, from, mary, to, bothwell, two, marriage, contracts, and, a, love, sonnet, or, sonnets, all, were, said, to, have, been, found, in, a, silver, gilt, casket, just, less, than, one, foot, 30, cm, long, and, decorated, with, the, monogram, of, king, francis, ii, mary, denied, writing, them, and, insisted, they, were, forgeries, arguing, that, her, handwriting, was, not, difficult, to, imitate, they, are, widely, believed, to, be, crucial, as, to, whether, mary, shared, the, guilt, for, darnley, s, murder, the, head, of, the, commission, of, inquiry, the, duke, of, norfolk, described, them, as, horrible, letters, and, diverse, fond, ballads, he, sent, copies, to, elizabeth, saying, that, if, they, were, genuine, they, might, prove, mary, s, guilt, the, authenticity, of, the, casket, letters, has, been, the, source, of, much, controversy, among, historians, it, is, impossible, now, to, prove, either, way, the, originals, written, in, french, were, possibly, destroyed, in, 1584, by, mary, s, son, the, surviving, copies, in, french, or, translated, into, english, do, not, form, a, complete, set, there, are, incomplete, printed, transcriptions, in, english, scots, french, and, latin, from, the, 1570s, other, documents, scrutinised, included, bothwell, s, divorce, from, jean, gordon, moray, had, sent, a, messenger, in, september, to, dunbar, to, get, a, copy, of, the, proceedings, from, the, town, s, registers, mary, s, biographers, such, as, antonia, fraser, alison, weir, and, john, guy, have, concluded, that, either, the, documents, were, complete, forgeries, or, incriminating, passages, were, inserted, into, genuine, letters, or, the, letters, were, written, to, bothwell, by, a, different, person, or, written, by, mary, to, a, different, person, guy, points, out, that, the, letters, are, disjointed, and, that, the, french, language, and, grammar, employed, in, the, sonnets, are, too, poor, for, a, writer, with, mary, s, education, but, certain, phrases, in, the, letters, including, verses, in, the, style, of, ronsard, and, some, characteristics, of, style, are, compatible, with, known, writings, by, mary, the, casket, letters, did, not, appear, publicly, until, the, conference, of, 1568, although, the, scottish, privy, council, had, seen, them, by, december, 1567, mary, had, been, forced, to, abdicate, and, held, captive, for, the, better, part, of, a, year, in, scotland, the, letters, were, never, made, public, to, support, her, imprisonment, and, forced, abdication, historian, jenny, wormald, believes, this, reluctance, on, the, part, of, the, scots, to, produce, the, letters, and, their, destruction, in, 1584, whatever, their, content, constitute, proof, that, they, contained, real, evidence, against, mary, in, contrast, weir, thinks, it, demonstrates, that, the, lords, required, time, to, fabricate, them, at, least, some, of, mary, s, contemporaries, who, saw, the, letters, had, no, doubt, that, they, were, genuine, among, them, was, the, duke, of, norfolk, who, secretly, conspired, to, marry, mary, in, the, course, of, the, commission, although, he, denied, it, when, elizabeth, alluded, to, his, marriage, plans, saying, he, meant, never, to, marry, with, a, person, where, he, could, not, be, sure, of, his, pillow, the, majority, of, the, commissioners, accepted, the, casket, letters, as, genuine, after, a, study, of, their, contents, and, a, comparison, of, the, penmanship, with, examples, of, mary, s, handwriting, elizabeth, as, she, had, wished, concluded, the, inquiry, with, a, verdict, that, nothing, was, proven, against, either, the, confederate, lords, or, mary, for, overriding, political, reasons, elizabeth, wished, neither, to, convict, nor, to, acquit, mary, of, murder, there, was, never, any, intention, to, proceed, judicially, the, conference, was, intended, as, a, political, exercise, in, the, end, moray, returned, to, scotland, as, regent, and, mary, remained, in, custody, in, england, elizabeth, succeeded, in, maintaining, a, protestant, government, in, scotland, without, either, condemning, or, releasing, her, fellow, sovereign, in, fraser, s, opinion, it, was, one, of, the, strangest, trials, in, legal, history, ending, with, no, finding, of, guilt, against, either, party, one, of, whom, was, allowed, to, return, home, to, scotland, while, the, other, remained, in, custody, on, 26, january, 1569, mary, was, moved, to, tutbury, castle, and, placed, in, the, custody, of, the, earl, of, shrewsbury, and, his, formidable, wife, bess, of, hardwick, elizabeth, considered, mary, s, designs, on, the, english, throne, to, be, a, serious, threat, and, so, confined, her, to, shrewsbury, s, properties, including, tutbury, sheffield, castle, sheffield, manor, lodge, wingfield, manor, and, chatsworth, house, all, located, in, the, interior, of, england, halfway, between, scotland, and, london, and, distant, from, the, sea, mary, was, permitted, her, own, domestic, staff, which, never, numbered, fewer, than, 16, she, needed, 30, carts, to, transport, her, belongings, from, house, to, house, her, chambers, were, decorated, with, fine, tapestries, and, carpets, as, well, as, her, cloth, of, state, on, which, she, had, the, french, phrase, en, ma, fin, est, mon, commencement, in, my, end, lies, my, beginning, embroidered, her, bed, linen, was, changed, daily, and, her, own, chefs, prepared, meals, with, a, choice, of, 32, dishes, served, on, silver, plates, she, was, occasionally, allowed, outside, under, strict, supervision, spent, seven, summers, at, the, spa, town, of, buxton, and, spent, much, of, her, time, doing, embroidery, her, health, declined, perhaps, through, porphyria, or, lack, of, exercise, by, the, 1580s, she, had, severe, rheumatism, in, her, limbs, rendering, her, lame, in, may, 1569, elizabeth, attempted, to, mediate, the, restoration, of, mary, in, return, for, guarantees, of, the, protestant, religion, but, a, convention, held, at, perth, rejected, the, deal, overwhelmingly, norfolk, continued, to, scheme, for, a, marriage, with, mary, and, elizabeth, imprisoned, him, in, the, tower, of, london, between, october, 1569, and, august, 1570, early, the, following, year, moray, was, assassinated, his, death,

to, replace, elizabeth, with, mary, with, the, help, of, spanish, troops, and, the, duke, of, norfolk, norfolk, was, executed, and, the, english, parliament, introduced, a, bill, barring, mary, from,

who, was, supposed, to, organise, the, invasion, of, england, from, the, spanish, netherlands, mary, sent, letters, in, cipher, to, the, french, ambassador, michel, de, castelnau, scores, of, which, were, discovered, and, decrypted, in, 2022, 2023, after, the, throckmorton, plot, of, 1583, walsingham, now, the, queen, s, principal, secretary, introduced, the, bond, of, association, and, the, act, for, the, queen, s, safety, which, sanctioned, the, killing, of, anyone, who, plotted, against, elizabeth, and, aimed, to, prevent, a, putative, successor, from, profiting, from, her, murder, in, 1584, mary, proposed, an, association, with, her, son, james, she, announced, that, she, was, ready, to, stay, in, england, to, renounce, the, pope, s, bull, of, excommunication, and, to, retire, abandoning, her, pretensions, to, the, english, crown, she, also, offered, to, join, an, offensive, league, against, france, for, scotland, she, proposed, a, general, amnesty, agreed, that, james, should, marry, with, elizabeth, s, knowledge, and, accepted, that, there, should, be, no, change, in, religion, her, only, condition, was, the, immediate, alleviation, of, the, conditions, of, her, captivity, james, went, along, with, the, idea, for, a, while, but, eventually, rejected, it, and, signed, an, alliance, treaty, with, elizabeth, abandoning, his, mother, elizabeth, also, rejected, the, association, because, she, did, not, trust, mary, to, cease, plotting, against, her, during, the, negotiations, in, february, 1585, william, parry, was, convicted, of, plotting, to, assassinate, elizabeth, without, mary, s, knowledge, although, her, agent, thomas, morgan, was, implicated, in, april, mary, was, placed, in, the, stricter, custody, of, sir, amias, paulet, at, christmas, she, was, moved, to, a, moated, manor, house, at, chartley, on, 11, august, 1586, after, being, implicated, in, the, babington, plot, mary, was, arrested, while, out, riding, and, taken, to, tixall, hall, in, staffordshire, in, a, successful, attempt, to, entrap, her, walsingham, had, deliberately, arranged, for, mary, s, letters, to, be, smuggled, out, of, chartley, mary, was, misled, into, thinking, her, letters, were, secure, while, in, reality, they, were, deciphered, and, read, by, walsingham, from, these, letters, it, was, clear, that, mary, had, sanctioned, the, attempted, assassination, of, elizabeth, mary, was, moved, to, fotheringhay, castle, in, a, four, day, journey, ending, on, 25, september, in, october, she, was, put, on, trial, for, treason, under, the, act, for, the, queen, s, safety, before, a, court, of, 36, noblemen, including, cecil, shrewsbury, and, walsingham, spirited, in, her, defence, mary, denied, the, charges, she, told, her, triers, look, to, your, consciences, and, remember, that, the, theatre, of, the, whole, world, is, wider, than, the, kingdom, of, england, she, protested, that, she, had, been, denied, the, opportunity, to, review, the, evidence, that, her, papers, had, been, removed, from, her, that, she, was, denied, access, to, legal, counsel, and, that, as, a, foreign, anointed, queen, she, had, never, been, an, english, subject, and, thus, could, not, be, convicted, of, treason, she, was, convicted, on, 25, october, and, sentenced, to, death, with, only, one, commissioner, lord, zouche, expressing, any, form, of, dissent, nevertheless, elizabeth, hesitated, to, order, her, execution, even, in, the, face, of, pressure, from, the, english, parliament, to, carry, out, the, sentence, she, was, concerned, that, the, killing, of, a, queen, set, a, discreditable, precedent, and, was, fearful, of, the, consequences, especially, if, in, retaliation, mary, s, son, james, formed, an, alliance, with, the, catholic, powers, and, invaded, england, elizabeth, asked, paulet, mary, s, final, custodian, if, he, would, contrive, a, clandestine, way, to, shorten, the, life, of, mary, which, he, refused, to, do, on, the, grounds, that, he, would, not, make, a, shipwreck, of, my, conscience, or, leave, so, great, a, blot, on, my, poor, posterity, on, 1, february, 1587, elizabeth, signed, the, death, warrant, and, entrusted, it, to, william, davison, a, privy, councillor, on, 3, february, ten, members, of, the, privy, council, of, england, having, been, summoned, by, cecil, without, elizabeth, s, knowledge, decided, to, carry, out, the, sentence, at, once, at, fotheringhay, on, the, evening, of, 7, february, 1587, mary, was, told, she, was, to, be, executed, the, next, morning, she, spent, the, last, hours, of, her, life, in, prayer, distributing, her, belongings, to, her, household, and, writing, her, will, and, a, letter, to, the, king, of, france, the, scaffold, that, was, erected, in, the, great, hall, was, draped, in, black, cloth, it, was, reached, by, two, or, three, steps, and, furnished, with, the, block, a, cushion, for, her, to, kneel, on, and, three, stools, for, her, and, the, earls, of, shrewsbury, and, kent, who, were, there, to, witness, the, execution, the, executioner, bull, and, his, assistant, knelt, before, her, and, asked, forgiveness, as, it, was, typical, for, the, executioner, to, request, the, pardon, of, the, one, being, put, to, death, mary, replied, i, forgive, you, with, all, my, heart, for, now, i, hope, you, shall, make, an, end, of, all, my, troubles, her, servants, jane, kennedy, and, elizabeth, curle, and, the, executioners, helped, mary, remove, her, outer, garments, revealing, a, velvet, petticoat, and, a, pair, of, sleeves, in, crimson, brown, the, liturgical, colour, of, martyrdom, in, the, catholic, church, with, a, black, satin, bodice, and, black, trimmings, as, she, disrobed, mary, smiled, and, said, she, never, had, such, grooms, before, nor, ever, put, off, her, clothes, before, such, a, company, she, was, blindfolded, by, kennedy, with, a, white, veil, embroidered, in, gold, knelt, down, on, the, cushion, in, front, of, the, block, on, which, she, positioned, her, head, and, stretched, out, her, arms, her, last, words, were, in, manus, tuas, domine, commendo, spiritum, meum, into, thy, hands, o, lord, i, commend, my, spirit, mary, was, not, beheaded, with, a, single, strike, the, first, blow, missed, her, neck, and, struck, the, back, of, her, head, the, second, blow, severed, the, neck, except, for, a, small, bit, of, sinew, which, the, executioner, cut, through, using, the, axe, afterwards, he, held, her, head, aloft, and, declared, god, save, the, queen, at, that, moment, the, auburn, tresses, in, his, hand, turned, out, to, be, a, wig, and, the, head, fell, to, the, ground, revealing, that, mary, had, very, short, grey, hair, cecil, s, nephew, who, was, present, at, the, execution, reported, to, his, uncle, that, after, her, death, her, lips, stirred, up, and, down, a, quarter, of, an, hour, after, her, head, was, cut, off, and, that, a, small, dog, owned, by, the, queen, emerged, from, hiding, among, her, skirts, though, eyewitness, emanuel, tomascon, does, not, include, those, details, in, his, exhaustive, report, items, supposedly, worn, or, carried, by, mary, at, her, execution, are, of, doubtful, provenance, contemporary, accounts, state, that, all, her, clothing, the, block, and, everything, touched, by, her, blood, was, burnt, in, the, fireplace, of, the, great, hall, to, obstruct, relic, hunters, when, the, news, of, the, execution, reached, elizabeth, she, became, indignant, and, asserted, that, davison, had, disobeyed, her, instructions, not, to, part, with, the, warrant, and, that, the, privy, council, had, acted, without, her, authority, elizabeth, s, vacillation, and, deliberately, vague, instructions, gave, her, plausible, deniability, to, attempt, to, avoid, the, direct, stain, of, mary, s, blood, davison, was, arrested, thrown, into, the, tower, of, london, and, found, guilty, of, misprision, he, was, released, nineteen, months, later, after, cecil, and, walsingham, interceded, on, his, behalf, mary, s, request, to, be, buried, in, france, was, refused, by, elizabeth, her, body, was, embalmed, and, left, in, a, secure, lead, coffin, until, her, burial, in, a, protestant, service, at, peterborough, cathedral, in, late, july, 1587, her, entrails, removed, as, part, of, the, embalming, process, were, buried, secretly, within, fotheringhay, castle, her, body, was, exhumed, in, 1612, when, her, son, king, james, vi, and, i, ordered, that, she, be, reinterred, in, westminster, abbey, in, a, chapel, opposite, the, tomb, of, elizabeth, in, 1867, her, tomb, was, opened, in, an, attempt, to, ascertain, the, resting, place, of, her, son, james, i, of, england, he, was, ultimately, found, with, henry, vii, many, of, her, other, descendants, including, elizabeth, of, bohemia, prince, rupert, of, the, rhine, and, the, children, of, anne, queen, of, great, britain, were, interred, in, her, vault, assessments, of, mary, in, the, 16th,
