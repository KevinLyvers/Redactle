any, government, anywhere, tolstoy, s, concept, of, non, violence, or, ahimsa, was, bolstered, when, he, read, a, german, version, of, the, tirukkural, he, later, instilled, the, concept, in, mahatma, gandhi, through, his, a, letter, to, a, hindu, when, young, gandhi, corresponded, with, him, seeking, his, advice, his, european, trip, in, 1860, 61, shaped, both, his, political, and, literary, development, when, he, met, victor, hugo, tolstoy, read, hugo, s, newly, finished, les, mis, rables, the, similar, evocation, of, battle, scenes, in, hugo, s, novel, and, tolstoy, s, war, and, peace,

assumed, name, in, brussels, tolstoy, reviewed, proudhon, s, forthcoming, publication, la, guerre, et, la, paix, war, and, peace, in, french, and, later, used, the, title, for, his, masterpiece, the, two, men, also, discussed, education, as, tolstoy, wrote, in, his, educational, notebooks, if, i, recount, this, conversation, with, proudhon, it, is, to, show, that, in, my, personal, experience, he, was, the, only, man, who, understood, the, significance, of, education, and, of, the, printing, press, in, our, time, fired, by, enthusiasm, tolstoy, returned, to, yasnaya, polyana, and, founded, 13, schools, for, the, children, of, russia, s, peasants, who, had, just, been, emancipated, from, serfdom, in, 1861, tolstoy, described, the, schools, principles, in, his, 1862, essay, the, school, at, yasnaya, polyana, his, educational, experiments, were, short, lived, partly, due, to, harassment, by, the, tsarist, secret, police, however, as, a, direct, forerunner, to, a, s, neill, s, summerhill, school, the, school, at, yasnaya, polyana, can, justifiably, be, claimed, the, first, example, of, a, coherent, theory, of, democratic, education, the, death, of, his, brother, nikolay, in, 1860, had, an, impact, on, tolstoy, and, led, him, to, a, desire, to, marry, on, 23, september, 1862, tolstoy, married, sophia, andreevna, behrs, who, was, sixteen, years, his, junior, and, the, daughter, of, a,

marked, from, the, outset, by, sexual, passion, and, emotional, insensitivity, when, tolstoy, on, the, eve, of, their, marriage, gave, her, his, diaries, detailing, his, extensive, sexual, past, and, the, fact, that, one, of, the, serfs, on, his, estate, had, borne, him, a, son, even, so, their, early, married, life, was, happy, and, allowed, tolstoy, much, freedom, and, the, support, system, to, compose, war, and, peace, and, anna, karenina, with, sonya, acting, as, his, secretary, editor, and, financial, manager, sonya, was, copying, and, hand, writing, his, epic, works, time, after, time, tolstoy, would, continue, editing, war, and, peace, and, had, to, have, clean, final, drafts, to, be, delivered, to, the, publisher, however, their, later, life, together, has, been, described, by, a, n, wilson, as, one, of, the, unhappiest, in, literary, history, tolstoy, s, relationship, with, his, wife, deteriorated, as, his, beliefs, became, increasingly, radical, this, saw, him, seeking, to, reject, his, inherited, and, earned, wealth, including, the, renunciation, of, the, copyrights, on, his, earlier, works, when, he, was, finishing, up, the, last, installments, of, anna, karenina, tolstoy, was, in, an, anguished, state, of, mind, and, he, began, putting, away, guns, and, ropes, out, of, fear, that, he, would, kill, himself, some, members, of, the, tolstoy, family, left, russia, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1905, russian, revolution, or, after, the, establishment, of, the, soviet, union, following, the, 1917, october, revolution, and, many, of, leo, tolstoy, s, relatives,

slavist, nikita, tolstoy, ru, 1923, 1996, is, also, a, russian, journalist, tv, and, radio, host, tolstoy, is, considered, one, of, the, giants, of, russian, literature, his, works, include, the, novels, war, and, peace, and, anna, karenina, and, novellas, such, as, hadji, murad, and, the, death, of, ivan, ilyich, tolstoy, s, earliest, works, the, autobiographical, novels, childhood, boyhood, and, youth, 1852, 1856, tell, of, a, rich, landowner, s, son, and, his, slow, realization, of, the, chasm, between, himself, and, his, peasants, though, he, later, rejected, them, as, sentimental, a, great, deal, of, tolstoy, s, own, life, is, revealed, they, retain, their, relevance, as, accounts, of, the, universal, story, of, growing, up, tolstoy, served, as, a, second, lieutenant, in, an, artillery, regiment, during, the, crimean, war, recounted, in, his, sevastopol, sketches, his, experiences, in, battle, helped, stir, his, subsequent, pacifism, and, gave, him, material, for, realistic, depiction, of, the, horrors, of, war, in, his, later, work, his, fiction, consistently, attempts, to, convey, realistically, the, russian, society, in, which, he, lived, the, cossacks, 1863, describes, the, cossack, life, and, people, through, a, story, of, a, russian, aristocrat, in, love, with, a, cossack, girl, anna, karenina, 1877, tells, parallel, stories, of, an, adulterous, woman, trapped, by, the, conventions, and, falsities, of, society, and, of, a, philosophical, landowner, much, like, tolstoy, who, works, alongside, the, peasants, in, the, fields, and, seeks, to, reform, their, lives, tolstoy, not, only, drew, from, his, own, life, experiences, but, also, created, characters, in, his, own, image, such, as, pierre, bezukhov, and, prince, andrei, in, war, and, peace, levin, in, anna, karenina, and, to, some, extent, prince, nekhlyudov, in, resurrection, richard, pevear, who, translated, many, of, tolstoy, s, works, said, of, tolstoy, s, signature, style, his, works, are, full, of, provocation, and, irony, and, written, with, broad, and, elaborately, developed, rhetorical, devices, war, and, peace, is, generally, thought, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, novels, ever, written, remarkable, for, its, dramatic, breadth, and, unity, its, vast, canvas, includes, 580, characters, many, historical, with, others, fictional, the, story, moves, from, family, life, to, the, headquarters, of, napoleon, from, the, court, of, alexander, i, of, russia, to, the, battlefields, of, austerlitz, and, borodino, tolstoy, s, original, idea, for, the, novel, was, to, investigate, the, causes, of, the, decembrist, revolt, to, which, it, refers, only, in, the, last, chapters, from, which, can, be, deduced, that, andrei, bolkonsky, s, son, will, become, one, of, the, decembrists, the, novel, explores, tolstoy, s, theory, of, history, and, in, particular, the, insignificance, of, individuals, such, as, napoleon, and, alexander, somewhat, surprisingly, tolstoy, did, not, consider, war, and, peace, to, be, a, novel, nor, did, he, consider, many, of, the, great, russian, fictions, written, at, that, time, to, be, novels, this, view, becomes, less, surprising, if, one, considers, that, tolstoy, was, a, novelist, of, the, realist, school, who, considered, the, novel, to, be, a, framework, for, the, examination, of, social, and, political, issues, in, nineteenth, century, life, war, and, peace, which, is, to, tolstoy, really, an, epic, in, prose, therefore, did, not, qualify, tolstoy, thought, that, anna, karenina, was, his, first, true, novel, after, anna, karenina, tolstoy, concentrated, on, christian, themes, and, his, later, novels, such, as, the, death, of, ivan, ilyich, 1886, and, what, is, to, be, done, develop, a, radical, anarcho, pacifist, christian, philosophy, which, led, to, his, excommunication, from, the, russian, orthodox, church, in, 1901, after, his, religious, conversion, tolstoy, came, to, reject, most, modern, western, culture, including, his, novels, war, and, peace, and, anna, karenina, as, elitist, counterfeit, art, with, different, aims, from, the, christian, art, of, universal, brotherly, love, he, sought, to, express, in, his, novel, resurrection, tolstoy, attempts, to, expose, the, injustice, of, man, made, laws, and, the, hypocrisy, of, an, institutionalized, church, tolstoy, also, explores, and, explains, the, economic, philosophy, of, georgism, of, which, he, had, become, a, very, strong, advocate, towards, the, end, of, his, life, tolstoy, also, tried, writing, poetry, with, several, soldier, songs, written, during, his, military, service, and, fairy, tales, in, verse, such, as, volga, bogatyr, and, oaf, stylized, as, national, folk, songs, they, were, written, between, 1871, and, 1874, for, his, russian, book, for, reading, a, collection, of, short, stories, in, four, volumes, total, of, 629, stories, in, various, genres, published, along, with, the, new, azbuka, textbook, and, addressed, to, schoolchildren, nevertheless, he, was, skeptical, about, poetry, as, a, genre, as, he, famously, said, writing, poetry, is, like, ploughing, and, dancing, at, the, same, time, according, to, valentin, bulgakov, he, criticised, poets, including, alexander, pushkin, for, their, false, epithets, used, simply, to, make, it, rhyme, tolstoy, s, contemporaries, paid, him, lofty, tributes, fyodor, dostoyevsky, who, died, thirty, years, before, tolstoy, admired, and, was, delighted, by, tolstoy, s, novels, and, conversely, tolstoy, also, admired, dostoyevsky, s, work, gustave, flaubert, on, reading, a, translation, of, war, and, peace, exclaimed, what, an, artist, and, what, a, psychologist, anton, chekhov, who, often, visited, tolstoy, at, his, country, estate, wrote, when, literature, possesses, a, tolstoy, it, is, easy, and, pleasant, to, be, a, writer, even, when, you, know, you, have, achieved, nothing, yourself, and, are, still, achieving, nothing, this, is, not, as, terrible, as, it, might, otherwise, be, because, tolstoy, achieves, for, everyone, what, he, does, serves, to, justify, all, the, hopes, and, aspirations, invested, in, literature, the, 19th, century, british, poet, and, critic, matthew, arnold, opined, that, a, novel, by, tolstoy, is, not, a, work, of, art, but, a, piece, of, life, isaac, babel, said, that, if, the, world, could, write, by, itself, it, would, write, like, tolstoy, later, novelists, continued, to, appreciate, tolstoy, s, art, but, sometimes, also, expressed, criticism, arthur, conan, doyle, wrote, i, am, attracted, by, his, earnestness, and, by, his, power, of, detail, but, i, am, repelled, by, his, looseness, of, construction, and, by, his, unreasonable, and, impracticable, mysticism, virginia, woolf, declared, him, the, greatest, of, all, novelists, james, joyce, noted, that, he, is, never, dull, never, stupid, never, tired, never, pedantic, never, theatrical, thomas, mann, wrote, of, tolstoy, s, seemingly, guileless, artistry, seldom, did, art, work, so, much, like, nature, vladimir, nabokov, heaped, superlatives, upon, the, death, of, ivan, ilyich, and, anna, karenina, he, questioned, however, the, reputation, of, war, and, peace, and, sharply, criticized, resurrection, and, the, kreutzer, sonata, however, nabokov, called, tolstoy, the, greatest, russian, writer, of, prose, fiction, critic, harold, bloom, called, hadji, murat, my, personal, touchstone, for, the, sublime, in, prose, fiction, to, me, the, best, story, in, the, world, when, william, faulkner, was, asked, to, list, what, he, thought, were, the, three, greatest, novels, he, replied, anna, karenina, anna, karenina, and, anna, karenina, critic, gary, saul, morson, referred, to, war, and, peace, as, the, greatest, of, all, novels, after, reading, schopenhauer, s, the, world, as, will, and, representation, tolstoy, gradually, became, converted, to, the, ascetic, morality, upheld, in, that, work, as, the, proper, spiritual, path, for, the, upper, classes, in, 1869, he, writes, do, you, know, what, this, summer, has, meant, for, me, constant, raptures, over, schopenhauer, and, a, whole, series, of, spiritual, delights, which, i, ve, never, experienced, before, no, student, has, ever, studied, so, much, on, his, course, and, learned, so, much, as, i, have, this, summer, in, chapter, vi, of, confession, tolstoy, quoted, the, final, paragraph, of, schopenhauer, s, work, it, explains, how, a, complete, denial, of, self, causes, only, a, relative, nothingness, which, is, not, to, be, feared, tolstoy, was, struck, by, the, description, of, christian, buddhist, and, hindu, ascetic, renunciation, as, being, the, path, to, holiness, after, reading, passages, such, as, the, following, which, abound, in, schopenhauer, s, ethical, chapters, the, russian, nobleman, chose, poverty, and, formal, denial, of, the, will, but, this, very, necessity, of, involuntary, suffering, by, poor, people, for, eternal, salvation, is, also, expressed, by, that, utterance, of, the, savior, matthew, 19, 24, it, is, easier, for, a, camel, to, go, through, the, eye, of, a, needle, than, for, a, rich, man, to, enter, into, the, kingdom, of, god, therefore, those, who, were, greatly, in, earnest, about, their, eternal, salvation, chose, voluntary, poverty, when, fate, had, denied, this, to, them, and, they, had, been, born, in, wealth, thus, buddha, sakyamuni, was, born, a, prince, but, voluntarily, took, to, the, mendicant, s, staff, and, francis, of, assisi, the, founder, of, the, mendicant, orders, who, as, a, youngster, at, a, ball, where, the, daughters, of, all, the, notabilities, were, sitting, together, was, asked, now, francis, will, you, not, soon, make, your, choice, from, these, beauties, and, who, replied, i, have, made, a, far, more, beautiful, choice, whom, la, povert, poverty, whereupon, he, abandoned, every, thing, shortly, afterwards, and, wandered, through, the, land, as, a, mendicant, in, 1884, tolstoy, wrote, a, book, called, what, i, believe, in, which, he, openly, confessed, his, christian, beliefs, he, affirmed, his, belief, in, jesus, christ, s, teachings, and, was, particularly, influenced, by, the, sermon, on, the, mount, and, the, injunction, to, turn, the, other, cheek, which, he, understood, as, a, commandment, of, non, resistance, to, evil, by, force, and, a, doctrine, of, pacifism, and, nonviolence, in, his, work, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, he, explains, that, he, considered, mistaken, the, church, s, doctrine, because, they, had, made, a, perversion, of, christ, s, teachings, tolstoy, also, received, letters, from, american, quakers, who, introduced, him, to, the, non, violence, writings, of, quaker, christians, such, as, george, fox, william, penn, and, jonathan, dymond, later, various, versions, of, tolstoy, s, bible, were, published, indicating, the, passages, tolstoy, most, relied, on, specifically, the, reported, words, of, jesus, himself, tolstoy, believed, that, a, true, christian, could, find, lasting, happiness, by, striving, for, inner, perfection, through, following, the, great, commandment, of, loving, one, s, neighbor, and, god, rather, than, guidance, from, the, church, or, state, another, distinct, attribute, of, his, philosophy, based, on, christ, s, teachings, is, nonresistance, during, conflict, this, idea, in, tolstoy, s, book, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, directly, influenced, mahatma, gandhi, and, therefore, also, nonviolent, resistance, movements, to, this, day, tolstoy, believed, that, the, aristocracy, was, a, burden, on, the, poor, he, opposed, private, land, ownership, and, the, institution, of, marriage, and, valued, chastity, and, sexual, abstinence, discussed, in, father, sergius, and, his, preface, to, the, kreutzer, sonata, ideals, also, held, by, the, young, gandhi, tolstoy, s, passion, from, the, depth, of, his, austere, moral, views, is, reflected, in, his, later, work, one, example, is, the, sequence, of, the, temptation, of, sergius, in, father, sergius, maxim, gorky, relates, how, tolstoy, once, read, this, passage, before, him, and, chekhov, and, tolstoy, was, moved, to, tears, by, the, end, of, the, reading, later, passages, of, rare, power, include, the, personal, crises, faced, by, the, protagonists, of, the, death, of, ivan, ilyich, and, of, master, and, man, where, the, main, character, in, the, former, and, the, reader, in, the, latter, are, made, aware, of, the, foolishness, of, the, protagonists, lives, in, 1886, tolstoy, wrote, to, the, russian, explorer, and, anthropologist, nicholas, miklouho, maclay, who, was, one, of, the, first, anthropologists, to, refute, polygenism, the, view, that, the, different, races, of, mankind, belonged, to, different, species, you, were, the, first, to, demonstrate, beyond, question, by, your, experience, that, man, is, man, everywhere, that, is, a, kind, sociable, being, with, whom, communication, can, and, should, be, established, through, kindness, and, truth, not, guns, and, spirits, tolstoy, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, development, of, christian, anarchist, thought, tolstoy, believed, being, a, christian, required, him, to, be, a, pacifist, the, apparently, inevitable, waging, of, war, by, governments, is, why, he, is, considered, a, philosophical, anarchist, the, tolstoyans, were, a, small, christian, anarchist, group, formed, by, tolstoy, s, companion, vladimir, chertkov, 1854, 1936, to, spread, tolstoy, s, religious, teachings, from, 1892, he, regularly, met, with, the, student, activist, vasily, maklakov, who, would, defend, several, tolstoyans, they, discussed, the, fate, of, the, doukhobors, philosopher, peter, kropotkin, wrote, of, tolstoy, in, the, article, on, anarchism, in, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, without, naming, himself, an, anarchist, leo, tolstoy, like, his, predecessors, in, the, popular, religious, movements, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, chojecki, denk, and, many, others, took, the, anarchist, position, as, regards, the, state, and, property, rights, deducing, his, conclusions, from, the, general, spirit, of, the, teachings, of, jesus, and, from, the, necessary, dictates, of, reason, with, all, the, might, of, his, talent, tolstoy, made, especially, in, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, a, powerful, criticism, of, the, church, the, state, and, law, altogether, and, especially, of, the, present, property, laws, he, describes, the, state, as, the, domination, of, the, wicked, ones, supported, by, brutal, force, robbers, he, says, are, far, less, dangerous, than, a, well, organized, government, he, makes, a, searching, criticism, of, the, prejudices, which, are, current, now, concerning, the, benefits, conferred, upon, men, by, the, church, the, state, and, the, existing, distribution, of, property, and, from, the, teachings, of, jesus, he, deduces, the, rule, of, non, resistance, and, the, absolute, condemnation, of, all, wars, his, religious, arguments, are, however, so, well, combined, with, arguments, borrowed, from, a, dispassionate, observation, of, the, present, evils, that, the, anarchist, portions, of, his, works, appeal, to, the, religious, and, the, non, religious, reader, alike, in, hundreds, of, essays, over, the, last, 20, years, of, his, life, tolstoy, reiterated, the, anarchist, critique, of, the, state, and, recommended, books, by, kropotkin, and, proudhon, to, his, readers, while, rejecting, anarchism, s, espousal, of, violent, revolutionary, means, in, the, 1900, essay, on, anarchy, he, wrote, the, anarchists, are, right, in, everything, in, the, negation, of, the, existing, order, and, in, the, assertion, that, without, authority, there, could, not, be, worse, violence, than, that, of, authority, under, existing, conditions, they, are, mistaken, only, in, thinking, that, anarchy, can, be, instituted, by, a, revolution, but, it, will, be, instituted, only, by, there, being, more, and, more, people, who, do, not, require, the, protection, of, governmental, power, there, can, be, only, one, permanent, revolution, a, moral, one, the, regeneration, of, the, inner, man, despite, his, misgivings, about, anarchist, violence, tolstoy, took, risks, to, circulate, the, prohibited, publications, of, anarchist, thinkers, in, russia, and, corrected, the, proofs, of, kropotkin, s, words, of, a, rebel, illegally, published, in, st, petersburg, in, 1906, in, 1908, tolstoy, wrote, a, letter, to, a, hindu, outlining, his, belief, in, non, violence, as, a, means, for, india, to, gain, independence, from, colonial, rule, in, 1909, gandhi, read, a, copy, of, the, letter, when, he, was, becoming, an, activist, in, south, africa, he, wrote, to, tolstoy, seeking, proof, that, he, was, the, author, which, led, to, further, correspondence, tolstoy, s, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, also, helped, to, convince, gandhi, of, nonviolent, resistance, a, debt, gandhi, acknowledged, in, his, autobiography, calling, tolstoy, the, greatest, apostle, of, non, violence, that, the, present, age, has, produced, their, correspondence, lasted, only, a, year, from, october, 1909, until, tolstoy, s, death, in, november, 1910, but, led, gandhi, to, give, the, name, tolstoy, colony, to, his, second, ashram, in, south, africa, both, men, also, believed, in, the, merits, of, vegetarianism, the, subject, of, several, of, tolstoy, s, essays, the, boxer, rebellion, stirred,

tolstoy, corresponded, with, the, chinese, intellectual, gu, hongming, and, recommended, that, china, remain, an, agrarian, nation, and, not, reform, like, japan, tolstoy, and, gu, opposed, the, hundred, day, s, reform, by, kang, youwei, and, believed, that, the, reform, movement, was, perilous, tolstoy, s, ideology, of, non, violence, shaped, the, thought, of, the, chinese, anarchist, group, society, for, the, study, of, socialism, tolstoy, denounced, the, intervention, by, the, eight, nation, alliance, which, included, russia, in, the, boxer, rebellion, in, china, the, filipino, american, war, and, the, second, boer, war, tolstoy, praised, the, boxer, rebellion, and, harshly, criticized, the, atrocities, of, the, russian, german, american, japanese, and, other, troops, of, the, eight, nation, alliance, he, heard, about, the, looting, rapes, and, murders, and, accused, the, troops, of, slaughter, and, christian, brutality, he, named, the, monarchs, most, responsible, for, the, atrocities, as, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, he, described, the, intervention, as, terrible, for, its, injustice, and, cruelty, the, war, was, also, criticized, by, other, intellectuals, such, as, leonid, andreyev, and, gorky, as, part, of, the, criticism, tolstoy, wrote, an, epistle, called, to, the, chinese, people, in, 1902, he, wrote, an, open, letter, describing, and, denouncing, nicholas, ii, s, activities, in, china, tolstoy, also, became, a, major, supporter, of, the, esperanto, movement, he, was, impressed, by, the, pacifist, beliefs, of, the, doukhobors, and, brought, their, persecution, to, the, attention, of, the, international, community, after, they, burned, their, weapons, in, peaceful, protest, in, 1895, he, aided, the, doukhobors, to, migrate, to, canada, he, also, provided, inspiration, to, the, mennonites, another, religious, group, with, anti, government, and, anti, war, sentiments, in, 1904, tolstoy, condemned, the, ensuing, russo, japanese, war, and, wrote, to, the, japanese, buddhist, priest, soyen, shaku, in, a, failed, attempt, to, make, a, joint, pacifist, statement, towards, the, end, of, his, life, tolstoy, became, occupied, with, the, economic, theory, and, social, philosophy, of, georgism, he, incorporated, it, approvingly, into, works, such, as, resurrection, 1899, the, book, that, was, a, major, cause, for, his, excommunication, he, spoke, with, great, admiration, of, henry, george, stating, once, that, people, do, not, argue, with, the, teaching, of, george, they, simply, do, not, know, it, and, it, is, impossible, to, do, otherwise, with, his, teaching, for, he, who, becomes, acquainted, with, it, cannot, but, agree, he, also, wrote, a, preface, to, george, s, journal, social, problems, tolstoy, and, george, both, rejected, private, property, in, land, the, most, important, source, of, income, for, russian, aristocracy, that, tolstoy, heavily, criticized, they, also, rejected, a, centrally, planned, socialist, economy, because, georgism, requires, an, administration, to, collect, land, rent, and, spend, it, on, infrastructure, some, assume, that, this, embrace, moved, tolstoy, away, from, his, anarchist, views, however, anarchist, versions, of, georgism, have, been, proposed, since, then, resurrection, in, which, the, nobleman, dmitri, ivanovich, nekhlyudov, realizes, that, the, earth, cannot, really, be, owned, and, that, everyone, should, have, equal, access, to, its, resources, and, advantages, hints, that, tolstoy, had, such, a, view, other, works, such, as, tolstoy, s, unfinished, play, the, light, that, shines, in, the, darkness, and, the, short, story, how, much, land, does, a, man, need, suggest, tolstoy, s, approval, of, small, communities, with, local, governance, to, manage, the, collective, land, rents, for, common, goods, and, heavily, criticize, state, institutions, such, as, the, justice, system, tolstoy, was, introduced, to, hunting, by, his, father, who, was, an, avid, huntsman, he, was, trained, to, hunt, from, a, young, age, and, became, a, passionate, huntsman, himself, he, was, known, to, shoot, duck, quail, snipe, woodcock, and, otters, for, example, tolstoy, wrote, in, his, diary, on, 23, march, 1852, the, weather, was, marvellous, went, out, hunting, rode, up, and, down, the, undulating, country, till, one, killed, two, ducks, his, novel, war, and, peace, included, hunting, scenes, tolstoy, spent, decades, hunting, but, stopped, sometime, in, the, 1880s, and, became, a, staunch, opponent, of, hunting, due, to, ethical, concerns, about, killing, in, 1890, tolstoy, wrote, a, preface, for, vladimir, chertkov, s, anti, hunting, pamphlet, zlaia, zabava, mysli, ob, okhote, an, evil, pastime, thoughts, about, hunting, although, tolstoy, in, his, later, life, opposed, hunting, he, never, abandoned, his, love, for, horse, riding, tolstoy, first, became, interested, in, vegetarianism, in, 1882, however, his, conversion, to, a, vegetarian, diet, was, a, long, and, gradual, process, william, fay, vladimir, konstantinovich, geins, who, visited, tolstoy, in, autumn, 1885, influenced, tolstoy, to, become, vegetarian, in, 1887, tolstoy, was, lapsing, from, a, vegetarian, diet, by, occasionally, eating, meat, it, was, only, from, 1890, that, tolstoy, adopted, a, strict, vegetarian, diet, which, he, was, alleged, to, have, never, consciously, betrayed, tolstoy, s, wife, sophia, argued, that, his, vegetarian, diet, did, not, provide, him, enough, nourishment, and, contributed, to, his, digestive, ailments, however, tolstoy, stated, that, his, health, was, not, deprived, on, the, diet, but, had, improved, critics, of, tolstoy, such, as, i, s, listovsky, suggested, that, tolstoy, s, writing, talent, went, into, decline, after, he, adopted, a, meatless, diet, tolstoy, became, a, vegetarian, for, ethical, and, spiritual, reasons, associating, a, meatless, diet, with, high, moral, views, on, life, he, viewed, both, hunting, and, eating, meat, as, a, moral, evil, as, they, involve, unnecessary, cruelty, to, animals, and, regretted, his, former, habits, in, 1891, tolstoy, obtained, a, copy, of, howard, williams, s, book, the, ethics, of, diet, from, chertkov, his, daughters, translated, the, book, into, russian, and, tolstoy, wrote, an, introductory, essay, titled, the, first, step, published, in, 1893, in, his, introductory, essay, he, described, a, cruel, experience, he, had, witnessed, at, a, visit, to, a, slaughterhouse, in, tula, the, cruelty, he, had, witnessed, confirmed, his, belief, that, meat, should, be, removed, from, the, diet, in, the, essay, he, wrote, that, meat, eating, is, simply, immoral, as, it, involves, the, performance, of, an, act, which, is, contrary, to, moral, feeling, killing, whilst, on, his, vegetarian, diet, tolstoy, was, eating, eggs, daily, but, was, questioned, by, one, of, his, friends, if, eating, eggs, amounts, to, taking, life, he, commented, that, yes, i, ought, to, have, stopped, taking, eggs, at, least, from, now, i, shall, stop, it, by, 1903, tolstoy, had, removed, eggs, from, his, diet, vasily, rozanov, who, had, visited, tolstoy, noted, that, vegetarianism, was, a, way, of, living, for, tolstoy, and, at, the, dinner, table, surrounded, by, family, and, guests, who, were, eating, meat, and, scrambled, eggs, tolstoy, was, eating, kasha, in, a, letter, to, a, d, zutphen, a, dutch, medical, student, tolstoy, wrote, that, my, health, not, only, has, not, suffered, it, has, in, fact, improved, significantly, since, i, have, given, up, milk, butter, and, eggs, as, well, as, sugar, tea, and, coffee, tolstoy, described, his, vegetarian, diet, consisting, of, oatmeal, porridge, whole, wheat, bread, cabbage, or, potato, soup, buckwheat, a, boiled, or, fried, potato, and, an, apple, prune, compote, tolstoy, died, on, 20, november, 1910, at, the, age, of, 82, just, before, his, death, his, health, was, a, concern, of, his, family, who, cared, for, him, daily, in, his, last, days, he, spoke, and, wrote, about, dying, renouncing, his, aristocratic, lifestyle, he, left, home, one, winter, night, his, secretive, departure, was, an, apparent, attempt, to, escape, from, his, wife, s, tirades, she, spoke, out, against, many, of, his, teachings, and, in, recent, years, had, grown, envious, of, his, attention, to, tolstoyan, disciples, tolstoy, died, of, pneumonia, at, astapovo, railway, station, after, a, day, s, train, journey, south, the, station, master, took, tolstoy, to, his, apartment, and, his, personal, doctors, arrived, and, gave, him, injections, of, morphine, and, camphor, the, police, took, extra, precautions, to, minimize, dissent, during, the, funeral, ceremonies, they, were, inconspicuous, but, looming, during, the, funeral, itself, which, two, thousand, people, attended, without, incident, three, choirs, sang, there, were, no, eulogies, per, the, family, s, request, though, 100, students, had, asked, to, speak, according, to, some, sources, tolstoy, spent, the, last, hours, of, his, life, preaching, love, non, violence, and, georgism, to, fellow, passengers, on, the, train, although, leo, tolstoy, was, regarded, as, a, christian, anarchist, and, not, a, socialist, his, ideas, and, works, still, influenced, socialist, thinkers, throughout, history, he, held, an, unromantic, view, of, governments, as, being, essentially, violent, forces, held, together, by, intimidation, from, state, authority, corruption, on, behalf, of, officials, and, the, indoctrination, of, people, from, a, young, age, in, regard, to, his, view, of, economics, he, advocated, for, a, return, to, subsistence, agriculture, in, his, view, a, simplified, economy, would, afford, a, lesser, need, for, the, exchange, of, goods, and, as, such, factories, and, cities, the, centers, of, industry, would, become, obsolete, in, 1944, literary, historian, and, soviet, medievalist, nikolai, gudzii, wrote, a, biography, of, tolstoy, that, spanned, 80, pages, it, was, designed, to, show, readers, that, tolstoy, would, have, revised, his, pacifistic, and, anti, patriotic, sentiments, if, he, were, alive, amid, world, war, ii, at, around, the, same, time, literary, scholar, and, historian, boris, eikhenbaum, in, a, stark, contrast, from, his, earlier, works, on, tolstoy, portrayed, the, russian, novelist, as, someone, whose, ideas, aligned, with, those, of, early, utopian, socialists, such, as, robert, owen, and, henri, saint, simon, eikenbaum, suggested, that, these, influences, can, be, seen, in, tolstoy, s, emphases, on, individual, happiness, and, peasant, welfare, the, discrepancies, in, eikenbaum, s, portrayals, of, tolstoy, can, be, attributed, to, the, political, pressure, in, soviet, russia, at, the, time, public, officials, pressured, literary, scholars, to, conform, with, party, doctrine, from, tolstoy, s, writings, the, tolstoyan, movement, was, birthed, and, its, members, used, his, works, to, promote, non, violence, anti, urbanism, and, opposition, to, the, state, while, tolstoy, himself, never, associated, with, the, movement, as, he, was, opposed, to, joining, any, organization, or, group, he, named, his, thirteenth, child, alexandra, sasha, l, vovna, tolstaya, the, heir, to, his, works, with, the, intention, that, she, would, publish, them, for, the, russian, people, meanwhile, tolstoy, designated, vladimir, chertkov, who, kept, many, of, tolstoy, s, manuscripts, as, the, editor, of, his, works, originally, tolstoy, wanted, to, make, the, russian, people, the, heirs, to, his, writings, but, russian, law, at, the, time, decreed, that, property, could, only, be, inherited, by, one, individual, following, the, russian, civil, war, in, 1917, writings, that, were, formerly, censored, could, now, be, published, since, all, literary, works, were, nationalized, in, november, 1918, alexandra, worked, during, these, years, to, publish, sets, of, tolstoy, s, works, from, 1917, to, 1919, she, worked, with, zadruga, publishing, house, to, publish, thirteen, booklets, on, tolstoy, s, writings, which, had, previously, been, censored, under, russia, s, imperial, rule, however, publishing, a, complete, collection, of, tolstoy, s, works, proved, to, be, more, difficult, in, december, 1918, the, commissariat, of, education, granted, chertkov, a, 10, million, rouble, subsidy, to, publish, a, complete, edition, of, his, works, but, it, never, materialized, due, to, government, control, of, publication, rights, cooperatives, were, additionally, made, illegal, in, russia, in, 1921, creating, another, obstacle, for, alexandra, and, chertkov, in, the, 1920s, tolstoy, s, estate, yasnaya, polyana, was, sanctioned, by, the, soviet, state, to, exist, as, a, commune, for, tolstoyans, the, government, permitted, this, christian, oriented, community, because, they, felt, that, religious, sects, like, the, tolstoyans, were, models, for, the, russian, peasantry, the, soviet, government, owned, the, estate, which, was, deemed, a, memorial, for, the, late, russian, writer, but, alexandra, had, jurisdiction, over, the, education, offered, at, yasnaya, polyana, unlike, most, soviet, schools, the, schooling, at, yasnaya, polyana, did, not, offer, militaristic, training, and, did, not, teach, atheism, over, time, though, local, communists, as, opposed, to, the, state, government, which, financially, supported, the, institution, often, denounced, the, estate, and, called, for, frequent, inspections, after, 1928, a, change, in, cultural, policy, in, the, soviet, regime, led, to, a, takeover, of, local, institutions, including, tolstoy, s, estate, when, alexandra, stepped, down, from, her, role, as, head, of, yasnaya, poliana, in, 1929, the, commissariat, of, education, and, health, took, control, in, 1925, the, soviet, government, created, its, first, jubilee, committee, to, celebrate, the, centennial, of, tolstoy, s, birth, which, originally, consisted, of, 13, members, but, grew, to, 38, members, after, a, second, committee, formed, in, 1927, alexandra, was, not, content, with, the, funds, provided, by, the, government, and, met, with, stalin, in, june, 1928, during, the, meeting, stalin, said, the, government, could, not, provide, the, one, million, roubles, requested, by, the, committee, however, an, agreement, was, reached, with, the, state, publishing, house, in, april, 1928, for, the, publishing, of, a, 92, volume, collection, of, tolstoy, s, works, during, the, jubilee, celebration, anatoly, luncharsky, the, head, of, the, people, s, commissariat, for, education, gave, a, speech, in, which, he, denied, reports, that, claimed, the, soviet, government, was, hostile, towards, tolstoy, and, his, legacy, instead, of, focusing, on, the, aspects, of, tolstoy, s, works, that, pitted, him, against, the, soviet, regime, he, instead, focused, on, the, unifying, aspects, such, as, tolstoy, s, love, for, equality, and, labor, as, well, as, his, disdain, for, the, state, and, private, property, more, than, 400, million, copies, of, tolstoy, s, works, have, been, printed, in, the, soviet, union, making, him, the, best, selling, author, in, soviet, russia, vladimir, lenin, wrote, several, essays, about, tolstoy, suggesting, that, a, contradiction, exists, within, his, critique, of, russian, society, according, to, lenin, tolstoy, who, adored, the, peasantry, and, voiced, their, discontent, with, imperial, russian, society, may, have, been, revolutionary, in, his, critiques, but, his, political, consciousness, was, not, fully, developed, for, a, revolution, lenin, uses, this, line, of, thinking, to, suggest, that, the, 1905, russian, revolution, which, he, called, a, peasant, bourgeois, revolution, failed, because, of, its, backwardness, the, revolutionaries, wanted, to, dismantle, the, existing, medieval, forms, of, oppression, and, replace, them, with, an, old, and, patriarchal, village, commune, tolstoy, s, concept, of, non, resistance, to, evil, additionally, hindered, the, 1905, revolution, s, success, lenin, thought, because, the, movement, was, not, militant, and, had, thus, allowed, the, autocracy, to, crush, them, nevertheless, lenin, concludes, in, his, writings, that, despite, the, many, contradictions, in, tolstoy, s, critiques, his, hatred, for, feudalism, and, capitalism, mark, the, prelude, to, proletarian, socialism, additionally, tolstoy, s, philosophy, of, non, resistance, to, evil, made, an, impact, on, mahatma, gandhi, s, political, thinking, gandhi, was, deeply, moved, by, tolstoy, s, concept, of, truth, which, in, his, view, constitutes, any, doctrine, that, reduces, suffering, for, both, gandhi, and, tolstoy, truth, is, god, and, since, god, is, universal, love, truth, must, therefore, also, be, universal, love, the, gujarati, word, for, gandhi, s, non, violent, movement, is, satyagraha, derived, from, the, word, sadagraha, the, sat, portion, translating, to, truth, and, the, agraha, translating, to, firmness, gandhi, s, conception, of, satyagraha, was, birthed, from, tolstoy, s, understanding, of, christianity, rather, than, from, hindu, tradition, the, death, of, ivan, ilyich, was, adapted, by, akira, kurosawa, as, ikiru, 1952, it, was, also, the, basis, for, living, 2022, with, a, screenplay, by, kazuo, ishiguro, in, the, george, lucas, television, show, the, young, indiana, jones, chronicles, later, retitled, the, adventures, of, young,
