anglican, deacon, alice, liddell, a, daughter, of, henry, liddell, the, dean, of, christ, church, is, widely, identified, as, the, original, inspiration, for, alice, in, wonderland, though, carroll, always, denied, this, an, avid, puzzler, carroll, created, the, word, ladder, puzzle, which, he, then, called, doublets, which, he, published, in, his, weekly, column, for, vanity, fair, magazine, between, 1879, and, 1881, in, 1982, a, memorial, stone, to, carroll, was, unveiled, at, poets, corner, in, westminster, abbey, there, are, societies, in, many, parts, of, the, world, dedicated, to, the, enjoyment, and, promotion, of, his, works, dodgson, s, family, was, predominantly, northern, english, conservative, and, high, church, anglican, most, of, his, male, ancestors, were, army, officers, or, anglican, clergymen, his, great, grandfather, charles, dodgson, had, risen, through, the, ranks, of, the, church, to, become, the, bishop, of, elphin, in, rural, ireland, his, paternal, grandfather, also, named, charles, was, an, army, captain, killed, in, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1803, when, his, two, sons, were, hardly, more, than, babies, the, older, of, these, sons, yet, another, charles, dodgson, was, carroll, s, father, he, went, to, rugby, school, and, then, to, christ, church, oxford, he, reverted, to, the, other, family, tradition, and, took, holy, orders, he, was, mathematically, gifted, and, won, a, double, first, degree, which, could, have, been, the, prelude, to, a, brilliant, academic, career, instead, he, became, a, country, parson, dodgson, was, born, on, 27, january, 1832, at, all, saints, vicarage, in, daresbury, cheshire, the, oldest, boy, and, the, third, oldest, of, 11, children, when, he, was, 11, his, father, was, given, the, living, of, croft, on, tees, yorkshire, and, the, whole, family, moved, to, the, spacious, rectory, this, remained, their, home, for, the, next, 25, years, charles, father, was, an, active, and, highly, conservative, cleric, of, the, church, of, england, who, later, became, the, archdeacon, of, richmond, and, involved, himself, sometimes, influentially, in, the, intense, religious, disputes, that, were, dividing, the, church, he, was, high, church, inclining, toward, anglo, catholicism, an, admirer, of, john, henry, newman, and, the, tractarian, movement, and, did, his, best, to, instil, such, views, in, his, children, however, charles, developed, an, ambivalent, relationship, with, his, father, s, values, and, with, the, church, of, england, as, a, whole, during, his, early, youth, dodgson, was, educated, at, home, his, reading, lists, preserved, in, the, family, archives, testify, to, a, precocious, intellect, at, the, age, of, seven, he, was, reading, books, such, as, the, pilgrim, s, progress, he, also, spoke, with, a, stammer, a, condition, shared, by, most, of, his, siblings, that, often, inhibited, his, social, life, throughout, his, years, at, the, age, of, twelve, he, was, sent, to, richmond, grammar, school, now, part, of, richmond, school, in, richmond, north, yorkshire, in, 1846, dodgson, entered, rugby, school, where, he, was, evidently, unhappy, as, he, wrote, some, years, after, leaving, i, cannot, say, that, any, earthly, considerations, would, induce, me, to, go, through, my, three, years, again, i, can, honestly, say, that, if, i, could, have, been, secure, from, annoyance, at, night, the, hardships, of, the, daily, life, would, have, been, comparative, trifles, to, bear, he, did, not, claim, he, suffered, from, bullying, but, cited, little, boys, as, the, main, targets, of, older, bullies, at, rugby, stuart, dodgson, collingwood, dodgson, s, nephew, wrote, that, even, though, it, is, hard, for, those, who, have, only, known, him, as, the, gentle, and, retiring, don, to, believe, it, it, is, nevertheless, true, that, long, after, he, left, school, his, name, was, remembered, as, that, of, a, boy, who, knew, well, how, to, use, his, fists, in, defence, of, a, righteous, cause, which, is, the, protection, of, the, smaller, boys, scholastically, though, he, excelled, with, apparent, ease, i, have, not, had, a, more, promising, boy, at, his, age, since, i, came, to, rugby, observed, mathematics, master, r, b, mayor, francis, walkingame, s, the, tutor, s, assistant, being, a, compendium, of, arithmetic, the, mathematics, textbook, that, the, young, dodgson, used, still, survives, and, it, contained, an, inscription, in, latin, which, translates, to, this, book, belongs, to, charles, lutwidge, dodgson, hands, off, some, pages, also, included, annotations, such, as, the, one, found, on, p, 129, where, he, wrote, not, a, fair, question, in, decimals, next, to, a, question, he, left, rugby, at, the, end, of, 1849, and, matriculated, at, the, university, of, oxford, in, may, 1850, as, a, member, of, his, father, s, old, college, christ, church, after, waiting, for, rooms, in, college, to, become, available, he, went, into, residence, in, january, 1851, he, had, been, at, oxford, only, two, days, when, he, received, a, summons, home, his, mother, had, died, of, inflammation, of, the, brain, perhaps, meningitis, or, a, stroke, at, the, age, of, 47, his, early, academic, career, veered, between, high, promise, and, irresistible, distraction, he, did, not, always, work, hard, but, was, exceptionally, gifted, and, achievement, came, easily, to, him, in, 1852, he, obtained, first, class, honours, in, mathematics, moderations, and, was, soon, afterwards, nominated, to, a, studentship, by, his, father, s, old, friend, canon, edward, pusey, in, 1854, he, obtained, first, class, honours, in, the, final, honours, school, of, mathematics, standing, first, on, the, list, and, thus, graduated, as, bachelor, of, arts, he, remained, at, christ, church, studying, and, teaching, but, the, next, year, he, failed, an, important, scholarship, exam, through, his, self, confessed, inability, to, apply, himself, to, study, even, so, his, talent, as, a, mathematician, won, him, the, christ, church, mathematical, lectureship, in, 1855, which, he, continued, to, hold, for, the, next, 26, years, despite, early, unhappiness, dodgson, remained, at, christ, church, in, various, capacities, until, his, death, including, that, of, sub, librarian, of, the, christ, church, library, where, his, office, was, close, to, the, deanery, where, alice, liddell, lived, the, young, adult, charles, dodgson, was, about, 6, feet, 1, 83, m, tall, and, slender, and, he, had, curly, brown, hair, and, blue, or, grey, eyes, depending, on, the, account, he, was, described, in, later, life, as, somewhat, asymmetrical, and, as, carrying, himself, rather, stiffly, and, awkwardly, although, this, might, be, on, account, of, a, knee, injury, sustained, in, middle, age, as, a, very, young, child, he, suffered, a, fever, that, left, him, deaf, in, one, ear, at, the, age, of, 17, he, suffered, a, severe, attack, of, whooping, cough, which, was, probably, responsible, for, his, chronically, weak, chest, in, later, life, in, early, childhood, he, acquired, a, stammer, which, he, referred, to, as, his, hesitation, it, remained, throughout, his, life, the, stammer, has, always, been, a, significant, part, of, the, image, of, dodgson, while, one, apocryphal, story, says, that, he, stammered, only, in, adult, company, and, was, free, and, fluent, with, children, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, this, idea, many, children, of, his, acquaintance, remembered, the, stammer, while, many, adults, failed, to, notice, it, dodgson, himself, seems, to, have, been, far, more, acutely, aware, of, it, than, most, people, whom, he, met, it, is, said, that, he, caricatured, himself, as, the, dodo, in, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, referring, to, his, difficulty, in, pronouncing, his, last, name, but, this, is, one, of, the, many, supposed, facts, often, repeated, for, which, no, first, hand, evidence, remains, he, did, indeed, refer, to, himself, as, a, dodo, but, whether, or, not, this, reference, was, to, his, stammer, is, simply, speculation, dodgson, s, stammer, did, trouble, him, but, it, was, never, so, debilitating, that, it, prevented, him, from, applying, his, other, personal, qualities, to, do, well, in, society, he, lived, in, a, time, when, people, commonly, devised, their, own, amusements, and, when, singing, and, recitation, were, required, social, skills, and, the, young, dodgson, was, well, equipped, to, be, an, engaging, entertainer, he, could, reportedly, sing, at, a, passable, level, and, was, not, afraid, to, do, so, before, an, audience, he, was, also, adept, at, mimicry, and, storytelling, and, reputedly, quite, good, at, charades, in, the, interim, between, his, early, published, writings, and, the, success, of, the, alice, books, dodgson, began, to, move, in, the, pre, raphaelite, social, circle, he, first, met, john, ruskin, in, 1857, and, became, friendly, with, him, around, 1863, he, developed, a, close, relationship, with, dante, gabriel, rossetti, and, his, family, he, would, often, take, pictures, of, the, family, in, the, garden, of, the, rossetti, s, house, in, chelsea, london, he, also, knew, william, holman, hunt, john, everett, millais, and, arthur, hughes, among, other, artists, he, knew, fairy, tale, author, george, macdonald, well, it, was, the, enthusiastic, reception, of, alice, by, the, young, macdonald, children, that, persuaded, him, to, submit, the, work, for, publication, in, broad, terms, dodgson, has, traditionally, been, regarded, as, politically, religiously, and, personally, conservative, martin, gardner, labels, dodgson, as, a, tory, who, was, awed, by, lords, and, inclined, to, be, snobbish, towards, inferiors, william, tuckwell, in, his, reminiscences, of, oxford, 1900, regarded, him, as, austere, shy, precise, absorbed, in, mathematical, reverie, watchfully, tenacious, of, his, dignity, stiffly, conservative, in, political, theological, social, theory, his, life, mapped, out, in, squares, like, alice, s, landscape, dodgson, was, ordained, a, deacon, in, the, church, of, england, on, 22, december, 1861, in, the, life, and, letters, of, lewis, carroll, the, editor, states, that, his, diary, is, full, of, such, modest, depreciations, of, himself, and, his, work, interspersed, with, earnest, prayers, too, sacred, and, private, to, be, reproduced, here, that, god, would, forgive, him, the, past, and, help, him, to, perform, his, holy, will, in, the, future, when, a, friend, asked, him, about, his, religious, views, dodgson, wrote, in, response, that, he, was, a, member, of, the, church, of, england, but, doubt, if, he, was, fully, a, high, churchman, he, added, i, believe, that, when, you, and, i, come, to, lie, down, for, the, last, time, if, only, we, can, keep, firm, hold, of, the, great, truths, christ, taught, us, our, own, utter, worthlessness, and, his, infinite, worth, and, that, he, has, brought, us, back, to, our, one, father, and, made, us, his, brethren, and, so, brethren, to, one, another, we, shall, have, all, we, need, to, guide, us, through, the, shadows, most, assuredly, i, accept, to, the, full, the, doctrines, you, refer, to, that, christ, died, to, save, us, that, we, have, no, other, way, of, salvation, open, to, us, but, through, his, death, and, that, it, is, by, faith, in, him, and, through, no, merit, of, ours, that, we, are, reconciled, to, god, and, most, assuredly, i, can, cordially, say, i, owe, all, to, him, who, loved, me, and, died, on, the, cross, of, calvary, dodgson, also, expressed, interest, in, other, fields, he, was, an, early, member, of, the, society, for, psychical, research, and, one, of, his, letters, suggests, that, he, accepted, as, real, what, was, then, called, thought, reading, dodgson, wrote, some, studies, of, various, philosophical, arguments, in, 1895, he, developed, a, philosophical, regressus, argument, on, deductive, reasoning, in, his, article, what, the, tortoise, said, to, achilles, which, appeared, in, one, of, the, early, volumes, of, mind, the, article, was, reprinted, in, the, same, journal, a, hundred, years, later, in, 1995, with, a, subsequent, article, by, simon, blackburn, titled, practical, tortoise, raising, from, a, young, age, dodgson, wrote, poetry, and, short, stories, contributing, heavily, to, the, family, magazine, mischmasch, and, later, sending, them, to, various, magazines, enjoying, moderate, success, between, 1854, and, 1856, his, work, appeared, in, the, national, publications, the, comic, times, and, the, train, as, well, as, smaller, magazines, such, as, the, whitby, gazette, and, the, oxford, critic, most, of, this, output, was, humorous, sometimes, satirical, but, his, standards, and, ambitions, were, exacting, i, do, not, think, i, have, yet, written, anything, worthy, of, real, publication, in, which, i, do, not, include, the, whitby, gazette, or, the, oxonian, advertiser, but, i, do, not, despair, of, doing, so, someday, he, wrote, in, july, 1855, sometime, after, 1850, he, did, write, puppet, plays, for, his, siblings, entertainment, of, which, one, has, survived, la, guida, di, bragia, in, march, 1856, he, published, his, first, piece, of, work, under, the, name, that, would, make, him, famous, a, romantic, poem, called, solitude, appeared, in, the, train, under, the, authorship, of, lewis, carroll, this, pseudonym, was, a, play, on, his, real, name, lewis, was, the, anglicised, form, of, ludovicus, which, was, the, latin, for, lutwidge, and, carroll, an, irish, surname, similar, to, the, latin, name, carolus, from, which, comes, the, name, charles, the, transition, went, as, follows, charles, lutwidge, translated, into, latin, as, carolus, ludovicus, this, was, then, translated, back, into, english, as, carroll, lewis, and, then, reversed, to, make, lewis, carroll, this, pseudonym, was, chosen, by, editor, edmund, yates, from, a, list, of, four, submitted, by, dodgson, the, others, being, edgar, cuthwellis, edgar, u, c, westhill, and, louis, carroll, in, 1856, dean, henry, liddell, arrived, at, christ, church, at, oxford, university, bringing, with, him, his, young, family, all, of, whom, would, figure, largely, in, dodgson, s, life, over, the, following, years, and, would, greatly, influence, his, writing, career, dodgson, became, close, friends, with, liddell, s, wife, lorina, and, their, children, particularly, the, three, sisters, lorina, edith, and, alice, liddell, he, was, widely, assumed, for, many, years, to, have, derived, his, own, alice, from, alice, liddell, the, acrostic, poem, at, the, end, of, through, the, looking, glass, spells, out, her, name, in, full, and, there, are, also, many, superficial, references, to, her, hidden, in, the, text, of, both, books, it, has, been, noted, that, dodgson, himself, repeatedly, denied, in, later, life, that, his, little, heroine, was, based, on, any, real, child, and, he, frequently, dedicated, his, works, to, girls, of, his, acquaintance, adding, their, names, in, acrostic, poems, at, the, beginning, of, the, text, gertrude, chataway, s, name, appears, in, this, form, at, the, beginning, of, the, hunting, of, the, snark, and, it, is, not, suggested, that, this, means, that, any, of, the, characters, in, the, narrative, are, based, on, her, information, is, scarce, dodgson, s, diaries, for, the, years, 1858, 1862, are, missing, but, it, seems, clear, that, his, friendship, with, the, liddell, family, was, an, important, part, of, his, life, in, the, late, 1850s, and, he, grew, into, the, habit, of, taking, the, children, on, rowing, trips, first, the, boy, harry, and, later, the, three, girls, accompanied, by, an, adult, friend, to, nearby, nuneham, courtenay, or, godstow, it, was, on, one, such, expedition, on, 4, july, 1862, that, dodgson, invented, the, outline, of, the, story, that, eventually, became, his, first, and, greatest, commercial, success, he, told, the, story, to, alice, liddell, and, she, begged, him, to, write, it, down, and, dodgson, eventually, after, much, delay, presented, her, with, a, handwritten, illustrated, manuscript, entitled, alice, s, adventures, under, ground, in, november, 1864, before, this, the, family, of, friend, and, mentor, george, macdonald, read, dodgson, s, incomplete, manuscript, and, the, enthusiasm, of, the, macdonald, children, encouraged, dodgson, to, seek, publication, in, 1863, he, had, taken, the, unfinished, manuscript, to, macmillan, the, publisher, who, liked, it, immediately, after, the, possible, alternative, titles, were, rejected, alice, among, the, fairies, and, alice, s, golden, hour, the, work, was, finally, published, as, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, in, 1865, under, the, lewis, carroll, pen, name, which, dodgson, had, first, used, some, nine, years, earlier, the, illustrations, this, time, were, by, sir, john, tenniel, dodgson, evidently, thought, that, a, published, book, would, need, the, skills, of, a, professional, artist, annotated, versions, provide, insights, into, many, of, the, ideas, and, hidden, meanings, that, are, prevalent, in, these, books, critical, literature, has, often, proposed, freudian, interpretations, of, the, book, as, a, descent, into, the, dark, world, of, the, subconscious, as, well, as, seeing, it, as, a, satire, upon, contemporary, mathematical, advances, the, overwhelming, commercial, success, of, the, first, alice, book, changed, dodgson, s, life, in, many, ways, the, fame, of, his, alter, ego, lewis, carroll, soon, spread, around, the, world, he, was, inundated, with, fan, mail, and, with, sometimes, unwanted, attention, indeed, according, to, one, popular, story, queen, victoria, herself, enjoyed, alice, in, wonderland, so, much, that, she, commanded, that, he, dedicate, his, next, book, to, her, and, was, accordingly, presented, with, his, next, work, a, scholarly, mathematical, volume, entitled, an, elementary, treatise, on, determinants, dodgson, himself, vehemently, denied, this, story, commenting, it, is, utterly, false, in, every, particular, nothing, even, resembling, it, has, occurred, and, it, is, unlikely, for, other, reasons, as, t, b, strong, comments, in, a, times, article, it, would, have, been, clean, contrary, to, all, his, practice, to, identify, author, of, alice, with, the, author, of, his, mathematical, works, he, also, began, earning, quite, substantial, sums, of, money, but, continued, with, his, seemingly, disliked, post, at, christ, church, late, in, 1871, he, published, the, sequel, through, the, looking, glass, and, what, alice, found, there, the, title, page, of, the, first, edition, erroneously, gives, 1872, as, the, date, of, publication, its, somewhat, darker, mood, possibly, reflects, changes, in, dodgson, s, life, his, father, s, death, in, 1868, plunged, him, into, a, depression, that, lasted, some, years, in, 1876, dodgson, produced, his, next, great, work, the, hunting, of, the, snark, a, fantastical, nonsense, poem, with, illustrations, by, henry, holiday, exploring, the, adventures, of, a, bizarre, crew, of, nine, tradesmen, and, one, beaver, who, set, off, to, find, the, snark, it, received, largely, mixed, reviews, from, carroll, s, contemporary, reviewers, but, was, enormously, popular, with, the, public, having, been, reprinted, seventeen, times, between, 1876, and, 1908, and, has, seen, various, adaptations, into, musicals, opera, theatre, plays, and, music, painter, dante, gabriel, rossetti, reputedly, became, convinced, that, the, poem, was, about, him, in, 1895, 30, years, after, the, publication, of, his, masterpieces, carroll, attempted, a, comeback, producing, a, two, volume, tale, of, the, fairy, siblings, sylvie, and, bruno, carroll, entwines, two, plots, set, in, two, alternative, worlds, one, set, in, rural, england, and, the, other, in, the, fairytale, kingdoms, of, elfland, outland, and, others, the, fairytale, world, satirizes, english, society, and, more, specifically, the, world, of, academia, sylvie, and, bruno, came, out, in, two, volumes, and, is, considered, a, lesser, work, although, it, has, remained, in, print, for, over, a, century, in, 1856, dodgson, took, up, the, new, art, form, of, photography, under, the, influence, first, of, his, uncle, skeffington, lutwidge, and, later, of, his, oxford, friend, reginald, southey, he, soon, excelled, at, the, art, and, became, a, well, known, gentleman, photographer, and, he, seems, even, to, have, toyed, with, the, idea, of, making, a, living, out, of, it, in, his, very, early, years, a, study, by, roger, taylor, and, edward, wakeling, exhaustively, lists, every, surviving, print, and, taylor, calculates, that, just, over, half, of, dodgson, s, surviving, work, depicts, young, girls, thirty, surviving, photographs, depict, nude, or, semi, nude, children, about, 60, of, dodgson, s, original, photographic, portfolio, was, deliberately, destroyed, dodgson, also, made, many, studies, of, men, women, boys, and, landscapes, his, subjects, also, include, skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and, trees, his, pictures, of, children, were, taken, with, a, parent, in, attendance, and, many, of, the, pictures, were, taken, in, the, liddell, garden, because, natural, sunlight, was, required, for, good, exposures, dodgson, also, found, photography, to, be, a, useful, entr, e, into, higher, social, circles, during, the, most, productive, part, of, his, career, he, made, portraits, of, notable, sitters, such, as, john, everett, millais, ellen, terry, maggie, spearman, dante, gabriel, rossetti, julia, margaret, cameron, michael, faraday, lord, salisbury, and, alfred, tennyson, by, the, time, that, dodgson, abruptly, ceased, photography, 1880, after, 24, years, he, had, established, his, own, studio, on, the, roof, of, tom, quad, created, around, 3, 000, images, and, become, an, amateur, master, of, the, medium, though, fewer, than, 1, 000, images, have, survived, time, and, deliberate, destruction, he, stopped, taking, photographs, because, keeping, his, studio, working, was, too, time, consuming, he, used, the, wet, collodion, process, commercial, photographers, who, started, using, the, dry, plate, process, in, the, 1870s, took, pictures, more, quickly, he, often, altered, his, photographs, through, blurring, techniques, or, by, painting, over, them, a, practice, new, to, the, nineteenth, century, he, exerted, his, agency, of, this, craft, by, literally, rewriting, the, text, created, by, the, image, to, produce, a, new, dialogue, about, childhood, however, popular, taste, changed, with, the, advent, of, modernism, affecting, the, types, of, photographs, that, he, produced, to, promote, letter, writing, dodgson, invented, the, wonderland, postage, stamp, case, in, 1889, this, was, a, cloth, backed, folder, with, twelve, slots, two, marked, for, inserting, the, most, commonly, used, penny, stamp, and, one, each, for, the, other, current, denominations, up, to, one, shilling, the, folder, was, then, put, into, a, slipcase, decorated, with, a, picture, of, alice, on, the, front, and, the, cheshire, cat, on, the, back, it, intended, to, organize, stamps, wherever, one, stored, their, writing, implements, carroll, expressly, notes, in, eight, or, nine, wise, words, about, letter, writing, it, is, not, intended, to, be, carried, in, a, pocket, or, purse, as, the, most, common, individual, stamps, could, easily, be, carried, on, their, own, the, pack, included, a, copy, of, a, pamphlet, version, of, this, lecture, another, invention, was, a, writing, tablet, called, the, nyctograph, that, allowed, note, taking, in, the, dark, thus, eliminating, the, need, to, get, out, of, bed, and, strike, a, light, when, one, woke, with, an, idea, the, device, consisted, of, a, gridded, card, with, sixteen, squares, and, a, system, of, symbols, representing, an, alphabet, of, dodgson, s, design, using,

devised, sometime, in, 1878, he, invented, the, doublet, see, word, ladder, a, form, of, brain, teaser, that, is, still, popular, today, changing, one, word, into, another, by, altering, one, letter,

of, parliamentary, representation, he, proposed, the, so, called, dodgson, s, method, using, the, condorcet, method, in, 1884, he, proposed, a, proportional, representation, system, based, on, multi, member, districts, each, voter, casting, only, a, single, vote, quotas, as, minimum, requirements, to, take, seats, and, votes, transferable, by, candidates, through, what, is, now, called, liquid, democracy, within, the, academic, discipline, of, mathematics, dodgson, worked, primarily, in, the, fields, of, geometry, linear, and, matrix, algebra, mathematical, logic, and, recreational, mathematics, producing, nearly, a, dozen, books, under, his, real, name, dodgson, also, developed, new, ideas, in, linear, algebra, e, g, the, first, printed, proof, of, the, rouch, capelli, theorem, probability, and, the, study, of, elections, e, g, dodgson, s, method, and, committees, some, of, this, work, was, not, published, until, well, after, his, death, his, occupation, as, mathematical, lecturer, at, christ, church, gave, him, some, financial, security, his, work, in, the, field, of, mathematical, logic, attracted, renewed, interest, in, the, late, 20th, century, martin, gardner, s, book, on, logic, machines, and, diagrams, and, william, warren, bartley, s, posthumous, publication, of, the, second, part, of, dodgson, s, symbolic, logic, book, have, sparked, a, reevaluation, of, dodgson, s, contributions, to, symbolic, logic, it, is, recognized, that, in, his, symbolic, logic, part, ii, dodgson, introduced, the, method, of, trees, the, earliest, modern, use, of, a, truth, tree, robbins, and, rumsey, s, investigation, of, dodgson, condensation, a, method, of, evaluating, determinants, led, them, to, the, alternating, sign, matrix, conjecture, now, a, theorem, the, discovery, in, the, 1990s, of, additional, ciphers, that, dodgson, had, constructed, in, addition, to, his, memoria, technica, showed, that, he, had, employed, sophisticated, mathematical, ideas, in, their, creation, dodgson, wrote, and, received, as, many, as, 98, 721, letters, according, to, a, special, letter, register, which, he, devised, he, documented, his, advice, about, how, to, write, more, satisfying, letters, in, a, missive, entitled, eight, or, nine, wise, words, about, letter, writing, published, in, 1890, dodgson, s, existence, remained, little, changed, over, the, last, twenty, years, of, his, life, despite, his, growing, wealth, and, fame, he, continued, to, teach, at, christ, church, until, 1881, and, remained, in, residence, there, until, his, death, public, appearances, included, attending, the, west, end, musical, alice, in, wonderland, the, first, major, live, production, of, his, alice, books, at, the, prince, of, wales, theatre, on, 30, december, 1886, the, two, volumes, of, his, last, novel, sylvie, and, bruno, were, published, in, 1889, and, 1893, but, the, intricacy, of, this, work, was, apparently, not, appreciated, by, contemporary, readers, it, achieved, nothing, like, the, success, of, the, alice, books, with, disappointing, reviews, and, sales, of, only, 13, 000, copies, the, only, known, occasion, on, which, he, travelled, abroad, was, a, trip, to, russia, in, 1867, as, an, ecclesiastic, together, with, the, reverend, henry, liddon, he, recounts, the, travel, in, his, russian, journal, which, was, first, commercially, published, in, 1935, on, his, way, to, russia, and, back, he, also, saw, different, cities, in, belgium, germany, partitioned, poland, and, lithuania, and, france, in, his, early, sixties, dodgson, increasingly, suffered, from, synovitis, which, eventually, prevented, him, walking, and, sometimes, left, him, bed, ridden, for, months, dodgson, died, of, pneumonia, following, influenza, on, 14, january, 1898, at, his, sisters, home, the, chestnuts, in, guildford, in, the, county, of, surrey, just, four, days, before, the, death, of, henry, liddell, he, was, two, weeks, away, from, turning, 66, years, old, his, funeral, was, held, at, the, nearby, st, mary, s, church, his, body, was, buried, at, the, mount, cemetery, in, guildford, he, is, commemorated, at, all, saints, church, daresbury, in, its, stained, glass, windows, depicting, characters, from, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, erected, in, 1935, a, bbc, documentary, from, 2015, the, secret, world, of, lewis, carroll, critically, examined, dodgson, s, relationship, with, alice, liddell, and, her, sisters, it, explored, the, possibility, that, dodgson, s, rift, with, the, liddell, family, and, his, temporary, suspension, from, the, college, might, have, been, caused, by, improper, relations, with, their, children, including, alice, the, research, for, the, documentary, found, a, disturbing, full, frontal, nude, of, alice, s, adolescent, sister, lorina, during, filming, and, speculated, on, the, likelihood, of, dodgson, taking, the, photo, however, it, was, later, revealed, the, timeline, for, this, research, had, more, than, met, the, eye, the, photo, currently, exists, in, the, archives, of, the, mus, e, cantini, in, marseille, and, was, attributed, to, dodgson, by, a, currently, unknown, hand, it, was, subsequently, revealed, in, early, 2015, by, the, carroll, scholar, edward, wakeling, that, the, photo, first, appeared, in, the, 1970s, when, it, was, owned, by, parisian, photo, collectors, the, provenance, of, the, photo, s, link, to, dodgson, could, be, questioned, it, was, left, to, the, mus, e, de, cantini, there, was, no, link, to, dodgson, and, no, link, to, the, liddell, family, this, was, not, explained, in, the, documentary, the, documentary, raised, suspicions, about, dodgson, being, a, repressed, paedophile, as, one, of, the, interviewees, will, self, put, it, this, aspect, was, leaked, to, the, telegraph, a, week, in, advance, when, reviewing, the, documentary, papers, sought, to, link, the, 19th, century, carroll, with, 21st, century, sexual, conduct, revelations, about, recent, paedophiles, this, attempted, link, could, be, considered, an, act, of, scapegoating, inspired, by, the, media, s, reactions, to, the, uk, s, early, 2010, yewtree, investigations, when, problems, about, the, documentary, s, conduct, and, research, surfaced, the, times, and, the, telegraph, reported, it, the, material, in, the, documentary, has, come, under, intense, scrutiny, by, carroll, scholars, including, those, such, as, jenny, woolf, and, edward, wakeling, who, appeared, in, it, woolf, claimed, that, she, was, not, told, of, the, use, of, the, alleged, photo, until, editing, of, the, documentary, was, underway, edward, wakeling, s, paper, review, eight, or, nine, wise, words, on, documentary, making, appeared, in, march, 2015, as, part, of, the, lewis, carroll, society, newsletter, bandersnatch, wakeling, also, echoed, woolf, s, assertions, that, he, was, not, given, time, to, talk, about, the, alleged, photo, wakeling, claimed, the, documentary, knew, i, could, authenticate, or, not, but, they, chose, to, keep, it, from, me, as, they, anticipated, my, response, wakeling, further, criticises, in, his, paper, the, cantini, photo, s, authenticity, the, bbc, s, failure, to, tell, participants, of, the, found, photo, and, several, factual, errors, wakeling, draws, attention, to, the, irregular, trimmed, nature, of, the, photo, itself, and, no, trace, of, dodgson, s, writing, the, inscription, on, the, back, of, the, photo, attributed, lewis, carroll, in, pencil, is, an, unknown, hand, so, it, could, have, been, written, by, anybody, the, photo, negative, is, also, missing, the, personal, catalogue, number, that, dodgson, meticulously, catalogued, his, photos, under, usual, practice, was, to, add, a, number, on, the, back, of, any, prints, which, he, had, developed, wakeling, also, points, out, that, dodgson, never, made, full, frontal, studies, particularly, a, girl, as, mature, as, this, there, s, no, way, the, liddells, would, have, allowed, a, picture, of, this, kind, to, have, been, taken, it, is, currently, unknown, whether, this, photo, is, by, dodgson, nor, who, wrote, the, pencil, inscription, on, the, back, of, it, and, for, what, reason, the, photo, was, not, included, in, wakeling, s, catalogue, raisonn, of, dodgson, s, complete, surviving, photographs, and, has, remained, unused, by, other, subsequent, documentaries, on, dodgson, the, bbc, trust, later, ruled, that, the, documentary, could, not, be, shown, on, uk, tv, in, its, current, form, again, as, the, bbc, failed, to, tell, participants, of, the, photo, s, appearance, during, filming, or, give, them, time, to, fully, react, to, it, late, twentieth, century, biographers, have, speculated, that, dodgson, s, interest, in, children, might, have, had, an, erotic, element, including, morton, n, cohen, in, his, lewis, carroll, a, biography, 1995, donald, thomas, in, his, lewis, carroll, a, portrait, with, background, 1995, and, michael, bakewell, in, his, lewis, carroll, a, biography, 1996, cohen, in, particular, speculates, that, dodgson, s, sexual, energies, sought, unconventional, outlets, and, further, writes, we, cannot, know, to, what, extent, sexual, urges, lay, behind, charles, s, preference, for, drawing, and, photographing, children, in, the, nude, he, contended, the, preference, was, entirely, aesthetic, but, given, his, emotional, attachment, to, children, as, well, as, his, aesthetic, appreciation, of, their, forms, his, assertion, that, his, interest, was, strictly, artistic, is, na, ve, he, probably, felt, more, than, he, dared, acknowledge, even, to, himself, cohen, goes, on, to, note, that, dodgson, apparently, convinced, many, of, his, friends, that, his, attachment, to, the, nude, female, child, form, was, free, of, any, eroticism, but, adds, that, later, generations, look, beneath, the, surface, p, 229, he, argues, that, dodgson, may, have, wanted, to, marry, the, 11, year, old, alice, liddell, and, that, this, was, the, cause, of, the, unexplained, break, with, the, family, in, june, 1863, an, event, for, which, other, explanations, are, offered, biographers, derek, hudson, and, roger, lancelyn, green, stop, short, of, identifying, dodgson, as, a, paedophile, green, also, edited, dodgson, s, diaries, and, papers, but, they, concur, that, he, had, a, passion, for, small, female, children, and, next, to, no, interest, in, the, adult, world, catherine, robson, refers, to, carroll, as, the, victorian, era, s, most, famous, or, infamous, girl, lover, several, other, writers, and, scholars, have, challenged, the, evidential, basis, for, cohen, s, and, others, views, about, dodgson, s, potential, exploitative, behavior, hugues, lebailly, has, endeavoured, to, set, dodgson, s, child, photography, within, the, victorian, child, cult, which, perceived, child, nudity, as, essentially, an, expression, of, innocence, he, claims, that, dodgson, s, diaries, contained, numerous, entries, that, reveal, an, appreciation, for, adult, women, as, well, as, their, appearance, in, art, and, theater, even, vulgar, entertainment, dodgson, s, nieces, removed, such, references, from, early, manuscripts, of, dodgson, s, diaries, but, kept, references, to, children, because, such, appreciation, was, not, controversial, at, the, time, lebailly, claims, that, studies, of, child, nudes, were, mainstream, and, fashionable, in, dodgson, s, time, and, that, most, photographers, made, them, as, a, matter, of, course, including, oscar, gustave, rejlander, and, julia, margaret, cameron, lebailly, continues, that, child, nudes, even, appeared, on, victorian, christmas, cards, implying, a, very, different, social, and, aesthetic, assessment, of, such, material, lebailly, concludes, that, it, has, been, an, error, of, dodgson, s, biographers, to, view, his, child, photography, with, 20th, or, 21st, century, eyes, and, to, have, presented, it, as, some, form, of, personal, idiosyncrasy, when, it, was, a, response, to, a, prevalent, aesthetic, and, philosophical, movement, of, the, time, karoline, leach, s, reappraisal, of, dodgson, focused, in, particular, on, his, controversial, interest, in, nude, children, she, argues, that, the, allegations, of, paedophilia, rose, initially, from, a, misunderstanding, of, victorian, morals, as, well, as, the, mistaken, idea, fostered, by, dodgson, s, various, biographers, that, he, had, no, interest, in, adult, women, she, termed, the, traditional, image, of, dodgson, the, carroll, myth, she, drew, attention, to, the, large, amounts, of, evidence, in, his, diaries, and, letters, that, he, was, also, keenly, interested, in, adult, women, married, and, single, and, enjoyed, several, relationships, with, them, that, would, have, been, considered, scandalous, by, the, social, standards, of, his, time, she, also, pointed, to, the, fact, that, many, of, those, whom, he, described, as, child, friends, were, girls, in, their, late, teens, and, even, twenties, she, argues, that, suggestions, of, paedophilia, emerged, only, many, years, after, his, death, when, his, well, meaning, family, had, suppressed, all, evidence, of, his, relationships, with, women, in, an, effort, to, preserve, his, reputation, thus, giving, a, false, impression, of, a, man, interested, only, in, little, girls, similarly, leach, points, to, a, 1932, biography, by, langford, reed, as, the, source, of, the, dubious, claim, that, many, of, carroll, s, female, friendships, ended, when, the, girls, reached, the, age, of, 14, in, addition, to, the, biographical, works, that, have, discussed, dodgson, s, alleged, sexual, misconduct, of, children, there, are, modern, artistic, interpretations, of, his, life, and, work, that, do, so, as, well, in, particular, dennis, potter, in, his, play, alice, and, his, screenplay, for, the, motion, picture, dreamchild, and, robert, wilson, in, his, musical, alice, dodgson, had, been, groomed, for, the, ordained, ministry, in, the, church, of, england, from, a, very, early, age, and, was, expected, to, be, ordained, within, four, years, of, obtaining, his, master, s, degree, as, a, condition, of, his, residency, at, christ, church, he, delayed, the, process, for, some, time, but, was, eventually, ordained, as, a, deacon, on, 22, december, 1861, but, when, the, time, came, a, year, later, to, be, ordained, as, a, priest, dodgson, appealed, to, the, dean, for, permission, not, to, proceed, this, was, against, college, rules, and, initially, dean, liddell, told, him, that, he, would, have, to, consult, the, college, ruling, body, which, would, almost, certainly, have, resulted, in, his, being, expelled, for, unknown, reasons, liddell, changed, his, mind, overnight, and, permitted, him, to, remain, at, the, college, in, defiance, of, the, rules, dodgson, never, became, a, priest, unique, amongst, senior, students, of, his, time, there, is, currently, no, conclusive, evidence, about, why, dodgson, rejected, the, priesthood, some, have, suggested, that, his, stammer, made, him, reluctant, to, take, the, step, because, he, was, afraid, of, having, to, preach, wilson, quotes, letters, by, dodgson, describing, difficulty, in, reading, lessons, and, prayers, rather, than, preaching, in, his, own, words, however, dodgson, did, indeed, preach, in, later, life, even, though, not, in, priest, s, orders, so, it, seems, unlikely, that, his, impediment, was, a, major, factor, affecting, his, choice, wilson, also, points, out, that, the, bishop, of, oxford, samuel, wilberforce, who, ordained, dodgson, had, strong, views, against, clergy, going, to, the, theatre, one, of, dodgson, s, great, interests, he, was, interested, in, minority, forms, of, christianity, he, was, an, admirer, of, f, d, maurice, and, alternative, religions, theosophy, dodgson, became, deeply, troubled, by, an, unexplained, sense, of, sin, and, guilt, at, this, time, the, early, 1860s, and, frequently, expressed, the, view, in, his, diaries, that, he, was, a, vile, and, worthless, sinner, unworthy, of, the, priesthood, and, this, sense, of, sin, and, unworthiness, may, well, have, informed, his, decision, to, abandon, being, ordained, to, the, priesthood, at, least, four, complete, volumes, and, around, seven, pages, of, text, are, missing, from, dodgson, s, 13, diaries, the, loss, of, the, volumes, remains, unexplained, the, pages, have, been, removed, by, an, unknown, hand, most, scholars, assume, that, the, diary, material, was, removed, by, family, members, in, the, interests, of, preserving, the, family, name, but, this, has, not, been, proven, except, for, one, page, material, is, missing, from, his, diaries, for, the, period, between, 1853, and, 1863, when, dodgson, was, 21, 31, years, old, during, this, period, dodgson, began, experiencing, great, mental, and, spiritual, anguish, and, confessing, to, an, overwhelming, sense, of, his, own, sin, this, was, also, the, period, of, time, when, he, composed, his, extensive, love, poetry, leading, to, speculation, that, the, poems, were, autobiographical, many, theories, have, been, put, forward, to, explain, the, missing, material, a, popular, explanation, for, one, missing, page, 27, june, 1863, is, that, it, might, have, been, torn, out, to, conceal, a, proposal, of, marriage, on, that, day, by, dodgson, to, the, 11, year, old, alice, liddell, however, there, has, never, been, any, evidence, to, suggest, this, and, a, paper, suggests, evidence, to, the, contrary, which, was, discovered, by, karoline, leach, in, the, dodgson, family, archive, in, 1996, this, paper, is, known, as, the, cut, pages, in, diary, document, carroll, s, nephew, philip, dodgson, jacques, reports, that, he, wrote, it, well, after, carroll, s, death, based, on, information, from, his, aunts, who, destroyed, two, diary, pages, including, the, one, for, 27, june, 1863, jacques, did, not, see, the, pages, himself, the, summary, for, 27, june, states, that, mrs, liddell, told, dodgson, there, was, gossip, circulating, about, him, and, the, liddell, family, s, governess, as, well, as, about, his, relationship, with, ina, presumably, alice, s, older, sister, lorina, liddell, the, break, with, the, liddell, family, that, occurred, soon, after, was, presumably, in, response, to, this, gossip, without, evidence, leach, suggests, an, alternative, interpretation, lorina, was, also, the, name, of, alice, liddell, s, mother, what, is, deemed, most, crucial, and, surprising, is, the, document, seems, to, imply, that, dodgson, s, break, with, the, family, was, not, connected, with, alice, at, all, until, a, primary, source, is, discovered, the, events, of, 27, june, 1863, will, remain, in, doubt, however, a, 1930, letter, from, the, younger, lorina, liddell, to, alice, may, shed, light, on, the, matter, reporting, an, interview, with, an, early, dodgson, biographer, she, wrote, i, said, his, manner, became, too, affectionate, to, you, as, you, grew, older, and, that, mother, spoke, to, him, about, it, and, that, offended, him, so, he, ceased, coming, to, visit, us, again, as, one, had, to, find, some, reason, for, all, intercourse, ceasing, mr, d, used, to, take, you, on, his, knee, i, did, not, say, that, in, his, diary, from, 1880, dodgson, recorded, experiencing, his, first, episode, of, migraine, with, aura, describing, very, accurately, the, process, of, moving, fortifications, that, are, a, manifestation, of, the, aura, stage, of, the, syndrome, there, is, no, clear, evidence, to, show, whether, this, was, his, first, experience, of, migraine, per, se, or, he, previously, had, the, far, more, common, form, of, migraine, without, aura, although, the, latter, seems, most, likely, given, the, fact, that, migraine, most, commonly, develops, in, the, teens, or, early, adulthood, another, form, of, migraine, aura, called, alice, in, wonderland, syndrome, has, been, named, after, dodgson, s, book, of, the, same, name, and, its, titular, character, because, its, manifestation, can, resemble, the, sudden, size, changes, in, the, book, it, is, also, known, as, micropsia, and, macropsia, a, brain, condition, affecting, the, way, that, objects, are, perceived, by, the, mind, for, example, an, affected, person, may, look, at, a, larger, object, such, as, a, basketball, and, perceive, it, as, having, the, size, of, a, golf, ball, some, authors, have, suggested, that, dodgson, experienced, this, type, of, aura, and, used, it, as, an, inspiration, in, his, work, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, did, dodgson, also, had, two, attacks, in, which, he, lost, consciousness, he, was, diagnosed, by, a, dr, morshead, dr, brooks, and, dr, stedman, and, they, believed, the, attack, and, a, consequent, attack, to, be, an, epileptiform, seizure, initially, thought, to, be, fainting, but, brooks, changed, his, mind, some, have, concluded, from, this, that, he, had, this, condition, for, his, entire, life, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, this, in, his, diaries, beyond, the, diagnosis, of, the, two, attacks, already, mentioned, some, authors, sadi, ranson, in, particular, have, suggested, that, carroll, had, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, in, which, consciousness, is, not, always, completely, lost, but, altered, and, in, which, the, symptoms, mimic, many, of, the, same, experiences, as, alice, in, wonderland, carroll, had, at, least, one, incident, in, which, he, suffered, full, loss, of, consciousness, and, awoke, with, a, bloody, nose, which, he, recorded, in, his, diary, and, noted, that, the, episode, left, him, not, feeling, himself, for, quite, sometime, afterward, this, attack, was, diagnosed, as, possibly, epileptiform, and, carroll, himself, later, wrote, of, his, seizures, in, the, same, diary, most, of, the, standard, diagnostic, tests, of, today, were, not, available, in, the, nineteenth, century, yvonne, hart, consultant, neurologist, at, the, john, radcliffe, hospital, oxford, considered, dodgson, s, symptoms, her, conclusion, quoted, in, jenny, woolf, s, 2010, the, mystery, of, lewis, carroll, is, that, dodgson, very, likely, had, migraine, and, may, have, had, epilepsy, but, she, emphasises, that, she, would, have, considerable, doubt, about, making, a, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, without, further, information, there, are, societies, in, many, parts, of, the, world, dedicated, to, the, enjoyment, and, promotion, of, his, works, and, the, investigation, of, his, life, copenhagen, street, in, islington, north, london, is, the, location, of, the, lewis, carroll, children, s, library, in, 1982, his, great, nephew, unveiled, a,
