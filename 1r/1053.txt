arminius, r, m, n, i, s, 18, 17, bc, ad, 21, was, a, chieftain, of, the, germanic, cherusci, tribe, who, is, best, known, for, commanding, an, alliance, of, germanic, tribes, at, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, in, ad, 9, in, which, three, roman, legions, under, the, command, of, general, and, governor, publius, quinctilius, varus, were, destroyed, his, victory, at, teutoburg, forest, precipitated, the, roman, empire, s, permanent, strategic, withdrawal, from, germania, magna, and, modern, historians, regard, it, as, one, of, rome, s, greatest, defeats, as, it, prevented, the, romanization, of, germanic, peoples, east, of, the, rhine, it, has, also, been, considered, one, of, the, most, decisive, battles, in, history, and, a, turning, point, in, human, history, born, a, prince, of, the, cherusci, tribe, arminius, was, part, of, the, roman, friendly, faction, of, the, tribe, he, learned, latin, and, served, in, the, roman, military, which, gained, him, roman, citizenship, and, the, rank, of, eques, after, serving, with, distinction, in, the, great, illyrian, revolt, he, was, sent, to, germania, to, aid, the, local, governor, publius, quinctilius, varus, in, completing, the, roman, conquest, of, the, germanic, tribes, while, in, this, capacity, arminius, secretly, plotted, a, germanic, revolt, against, roman, rule, which, culminated, in, the, ambush, and, destruction, of, three, roman, legions, in, the, teutoburg, forest, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, arminius, fought, retaliatory, invasions, by, the, roman, general, germanicus, in, the, battles, of, pontes, longi, idistaviso, and, the, angrivarian, wall, and, deposed, a, rival, the, marcomanni, king, maroboduus, germanic, nobles, afraid, of, arminius, s, growing, power, assassinated, him, in, 21, he, was, remembered, in, germanic, legends, for, generations, afterwards, the, roman, historian, tacitus, designated, arminius, as, the, liberator, of, the, germanic, tribes, and, commended, him, for, having, fought, the, roman, empire, to, a, standstill, at, the, peak, of, its, power, during, the, unification, of, germany, in, the, 19th, century, arminius, was, hailed, by, german, nationalists, as, a, symbol, of, german, unity, and, freedom, following, world, war, ii, however, arminius, significance, diminished, in, germany, due, to, his, association, with, militaristic, nationalism, the, 2, 000th, anniversary, of, his, victory, at, the, teutoburg, forest, was, only, lightly, commemorated, in, germany, the, etymology, of, the, latin, name, arminius, is, unknown, and, confusion, is, further, created, by, recent, scholars, who, alternately, referred, to, him, as, armenus, in, his, history, marcus, velleius, paterculus, calls, him, arminius, the, son, of, sigimer, a, prince, of, the, nation, and, states, he, attained, the, dignity, of, equestrian, rank, due, to, roman, naming, conventions, of, the, time, it, is, likely, arminius, is, an, adopted, name, granted, to, him, upon, citizenship, or, in, any, case, not, his, germanic, name, the, name, instead, appears, to, ultimately, be, of, etruscan, origin, appearing, as, armne, and, armni, on, inscriptions, found, at, volaterrae, according, to, another, theory, that, name, was, given, to, arminius, for, his, service, in, armenia, the, german, translation, of, arminius, as, the, name, hermann, dates, from, the, 16th, century, possibly, first, by, martin, luther, in, german, arminius, was, traditionally, distinguished, as, hermann, der, cherusker, hermann, the, cheruscan, or, hermann, der, cheruskerf, rst, hermann, the, cheruscan, prince, hermann, etymologically, means, man, of, war, coming, from, the, old, high, german, heri, meaning, war, and, man, meaning, person, or, man, this, has, also, led, to, his, english, nickname, herman, the, german, born, in, 18, or, 17, bc, in, germania, arminius, was, the, son, of, the, cheruscan, chief, segimerus, german, segimer, proto, germanic, sigimariz, old, english, sigem, r, who, was, allied, with, rome, arminius, learned, to, speak, latin, and, joined, the, roman, military, with, his, younger, brother, flavus, he, served, in, the, roman, army, between, ad, 1, and, 6, and, received, a, military, education, as, well, as, roman, citizenship, and, the, status, of, equite, before, returning, to, germania, these, experiences, gave, him, knowledge, of, roman, politics, and, military, tactics, which, allowed, him, to, successfully, anticipate, enemy, battle, maneuvers, during, his, later, campaigns, against, the, roman, army, around, the, year, ad, 4, arminius, assumed, command, of, a, cheruscan, detachment, of, roman, auxiliary, forces, probably, while, fighting, in, the, pannonian, wars, on, the, balkan, peninsula, he, returned, to, northern, germania, in, ad, 7, or, 8, where, the, roman, empire, had, established, secure, control, of, the, territories, just, east, of, the, rhine, along, the, lippe, and, main, rivers, and, was, now, seeking, to, extend, its, hegemony, eastward, to, the, weser, and, elbe, rivers, under, publius, quinctilius, varus, a, high, ranking, administrative, official, appointed, by, augustus, as, governor, arminius, began, plotting, to, unite, various, germanic, tribes, in, order, to, thwart, roman, efforts, to, incorporate, their, lands, into, the, empire, this, proved, a, difficult, task, as, the, tribes, were, strongly, independent, and, many, were, traditionally, enemies, of, each, other, between, ad, 6, and, 9, the, romans, were, forced, to, move, eight, of, the, eleven, legions, present, in, germania, east, of, the, rhine, to, crush, a, rebellion, in, the, balkans, leaving, varus, with, only, three, legions, to, face, the, germans, which, was, still, 18, 000, troops, or, 6, 000, men, per, legion, an, additional, two, legions, under, the, command, of, lucius, nonius, asprenas, were, stationed, in, moguntiacum, arminius, saw, this, as, the, perfect, opportunity, to, defeat, varus, in, the, autumn, of, ad, 9, the, 25, year, old, arminius, brought, to, varus, a, false, report, of, rebellion, in, northern, germany, he, persuaded, varus, to, divert, the, three, legions, under, his, command, composed, of, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, legions, plus, three, cavalry, detachments, and, six, cohorts, of, auxiliaries, which, were, at, the, time, marching, to, winter, quarters, to, suppress, the, rebellion, varus, and, his, legions, marched, right, into, the, trap, that, arminius, had, set, for, them, near, kalkriese, arminius, tribe, the, cherusci, and, their, allies, the, marsi, chatti, bructeri, chauci, and, sicambri, five, out, of, at, least, fifty, germanic, tribes, at, the, time, ambushed, and, annihilated, varus, entire, army, totaling, over, 20, 000, men, as, it, marched, along, a, narrow, road, through, a, dense, forest, recent, archaeological, finds, show, the, long, debated, location, of, the, three, day, battle, was, almost, certainly, near, kalkriese, hill, about, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, north, of, present, day, osnabr, ck, when, defeat, was, certain, varus, committed, suicide, the, battle, was, one, of, the, most, devastating, defeats, rome, suffered, in, its, history, arminius, success, in, destroying, three, entire, legions, and, driving, the, romans, out, of, germany, marked, a, high, point, of, germanic, power, for, centuries, roman, attempts, to, reconquer, germania, failed, although, they, did, eventually, manage, to, break, arminius, carefully, coordinated, alliance, after, the, battle, the, germans, quickly, annihilated, every, trace, of, roman, presence, east, of, the, rhine, roman, settlements, such, as, the, waldgirmes, forum, were, abandoned, the, vastly, outnumbered, roman, garrison, of, aliso, present, day, haltern, am, see, under, the, command, of, the, prefect, lucius, cedicius, inflicted, heavy, losses, on, the, germans, before, retreating, into, gaul, resisting, long, enough, for, lucius, nonius, asprenas, to, organize, the, roman, defense, on, the, rhine, and, tiberius, to, arrive, with, a, new, army, this, prevented, arminius, from, crossing, the, rhine, and, invading, gaul, at, some, point, after, the, battle, arminius, married, a, germanic, princess, named, thusnelda, her, father, was, the, cheruscan, prince, segestes, who, was, pro, roman, but, arminius, abducted, and, then, impregnated, thusnelda, circa, ad, 14, this, elopement, was, likely, a, result, of, a, dispute, between, arminius, and, segestes, who, was, against, their, relationship, in, may, of, 15, the, roman, general, germanicus, captured, thusnelda, at, the, point, of, her, capture, she, was, pregnant, and, living, with, her, father, who, had, taken, her, back, arminius, deeply, grieved, the, capture, of, thusnelda, and, did, not, marry, again, tacitus, recorded, that, arminius, was, driven, to, frenzy, by, the, loss, of, his, beloved, wife, tacitus, states, in, the, annals, arminius, with, his, naturally, furious, temper, was, driven, to, frenzy, by, the, seizure, of, his, wife, and, the, foredooming, to, slavery, of, his, wife, s, unborn, child, he, flew, hither, and, thither, among, the, cherusci, demanding, war, against, segestes, war, against, c, sar, and, he, refrained, not, from, taunts, thusnelda, gave, birth, to, a, son, named, thumelicus, who, grew, up, in, roman, captivity, tacitus, describes, him, as, having, an, unusual, story, which, he, promises, to, tell, in, his, later, writings, but, these, writings, have, never, been, found, between, 14, and, 16, germanicus, led, punitive, operations, into, germany, fighting, arminius, to, a, draw, in, the, battle, at, pontes, longi, and, twice, defeating, him, according, to, tacitus, first, in, the, battle, of, idistaviso, and, later, at, the, battle, of, the, angrivarian, wall, in, 15, roman, troops, managed, to, recapture, one, of, the, three, legionary, eagles, lost, in, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, in, 16, a, second, eagle, was, retrieved, tiberius, denied, the, request, of, germanicus, to, launch, an, additional, campaign, for, 17, however, having, decided, the, frontier, with, germania, would, stand, at, the, rhine, river, instead, he, offered, germanicus, the, honor, of, a, triumph, for, his, two, victories, the, third, roman, eagle, was, recovered, in, 41, by, publius, gabinius, under, the, emperor, claudius, arminius, also, faced, opposition, from, his, father, in, law, and, other, pro, roman, germanic, leaders, his, brother, flavus, who, had, been, raised, alongside, him, in, rome, remained, loyal, to, the, roman, empire, and, fought, under, germanicus, against, arminius, at, the, battle, of, idistaviso, with, the, end, of, the, roman, threat, a, war, broke, out, between, arminius, and, marbod, king, of, the, marcomanni, it, ended, with, marbod, fleeing, to, ravenna, and, roman, protection, but, arminius, failed, to, break, into, the, natural, fortification, of, bohemia, and, the, war, ended, in, stalemate, in, 19, germanicus, died, in, antioch, under, circumstances, which, led, many, to, believe, he, had, been, poisoned, by, his, opponents, arminius, died, two, years, later, in, 21, murdered, by, opponents, within, his, own, tribe, who, felt, that, he, was, becoming, too, powerful, tiberius, allegedly, had, refused, an, earlier, offer, from, a, chatti, nobleman, to, poison, arminius, it, was, not, by, secret, treachery, but, openly, and, by, arms, that, the, people, of, rome, avenged, themselves, on, their, enemies, arminius, victory, against, the, roman, legions, in, the, teutoburg, forest, had, a, far, reaching, effect, on, the, subsequent, history, of, both, the, ancient, germanic, peoples, and, on, the, roman, empire, the, romans, made, no, further, concerted, efforts, to, conquer, and, permanently, hold, germania, beyond, the, rhine, and, the, agri, decumates, numerous, modern, historians, have, regarded, arminius, victory, as, one, of, the, most, decisive, battles, in, history, with, some, calling, it, rome, s, greatest, defeat, in, the, accounts, of, his, roman, enemies, arminius, is, highly, regarded, for, his, military, leadership, and, as, a, defender, of, the, liberty, of, his, people, based, on, these, records, the, story, of, arminius, was, revived, in, the, 16th, century, with, the, recovery, of, the, histories, of, tacitus, who, wrote, in, his, annales, ii, 88, arminius, without, doubt, germania, s, liberator, who, challenged, the, roman, people, not, in, its, beginnings, like, other, kings, and, leaders, but, in, the, peak, of, its, empire, in, battles, with, changing, success, undefeated, in, the, war, arminius, was, not, the, only, reason, for, rome, s, change, of, policy, towards, germania, politics, also, played, a, factor, emperors, found, they, could, rarely, trust, a, large, army, to, a, potential, rival, though, augustus, had, enough, loyal, family, members, to, wage, his, wars, also, augustus, in, his, 40, year, reign, had, annexed, many, territories, still, at, the, beginning, of, the, process, of, romanization, tiberius, who, succeeded, augustus, in, ad, 14, decided, that, germania, was, a, far, less, developed, land, possessing, few, villages, and, only, a, small, food, surplus, and, therefore, was, not, currently, important, to, rome, conquering, germania, would, require, a, commitment, too, burdensome, for, the, imperial, finances, and, an, excessive, expenditure, of, military, force, modern, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, the, rhine, was, a, more, practical, boundary, for, the, roman, empire, than, any, other, river, in, germania, armies, on, the, rhine, could, be, supplied, from, the, mediterranean, sea, via, the, rh, ne, sa, ne, and, mosel, with, only, a, brief, area, of, portage, armies, on, the, elbe, however, would, have, to, have, been, supplied, by, extensive, overland, routes, or, by, ships, travelling, the, hazardous, atlantic, economically, the, rhine, already, had, towns, and, sizable, villages, at, the, time, of, the, gallic, conquest, the, rhine, was, significantly, more, accessible, from, rome, and, better, equipped, to, supply, sizable, garrisons, than, the, regions, beyond, rome, chose, no, longer, to, rule, directly, in, germania, east, of, the, rhine, and, north, of, the, danube, instead, preferring, to, exert, indirect, influence, by, appointing, client, kings, which, was, cheaper, than, military, campaigns, italicus, nephew, of, arminius, was, appointed, king, of, the, cherusci, vangio, and, sido, became, vassal, princes, of, the, powerful, suebi, etc, when, indirect, methods, proved, insufficient, to, control, the, germanic, tribes, beyond, the, rhine, roman, emperors, occasionally, led, devastating, punitive, campaigns, deep, into, germania, one, of, them, led, by, the, roman, emperor, maximinus, thrax, resulted, in, a, roman, victory, in, 235, at, the, battle, at, the, harzhorn, hill, located, in, the, modern, german, state, of, lower, saxony, east, of, the, weser, river, between, the, towns, of, kalefeld, and, bad, gandersheim, in, the, early, 19th, century, attempts, were, made, to, show, that, the, story, of, arminius, and, his, victory, may, have, lived, on, in, the, old, norse, sagas, in, the, form, of, the, dragon, slayer, sigurd, of, the, v, lsunga, saga, and, the, nibelungenlied, an, icelandic, account, states, that, sigurd, slew, the, dragon, in, the, gnitaheidr, today, the, suburb, knetterheide, of, the, city, of, bad, salzuflen, located, at, a, strategic, site, on, the, werre, river, which, could, very, well, have, been, the, point, of, departure, of, varus, legions, on, their, way, to, their, doom, in, the, teutoburg, forest, one, of, the, foremost, scandinavian, scholars, of, the, 19th, century, gu, brandur, vigf, sson, identified, sigurd, as, arminius, this, educated, guess, was, also, picked, up, by, otto, h, fler, who, was, a, prominent, nazi, academic, during, world, war, ii, during, the, unification, of, germany, in, the, 19th, century, arminius, was, hailed, as, a, symbol, of, german, unity, and, freedom, in, germany, the, name, arminius, was, interpreted, as, reflecting, the, name, hermann, by, martin, luther, who, saw, arminius, as, a, symbol, of, the, german, people, and, their, fight, against, rome, hermann, der, cheruskerf, rst, became, an, emblem, of, the, revival, of, german, nationalism, fueled, by, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, 19th, century, such, as, in, caspar, david, friedrich, s, 1812, painting, the, tombs, of, the, old, heroes, in, 1808, heinrich, von, kleist, wrote, the, play, die, hermannsschlacht, but, with, napoleon, s, victory, at, wagram, it, remained, in, manuscript, being, published, in, 1821, and, not, staged, until, 1860, the, play, has, been, revived, repeatedly, at, moments, propitious, for, raw, expressions, of, national, romanticism, and, was, especially, popular, in, nazi, germany, in, 1838, construction, was, started, on, a, massive, statue, of, arminius, known, as, the, hermannsdenkmal, on, a, hill, near, detmold, in, the, teutoburg, forest, it, was, finally, completed, and, dedicated, during, the, early, years, of, the, second, german, empire, in, the, wake, of, the, german, victory, over, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 1871, the, monument, has, been, a, major, tourist, attraction, ever, since, as, has, the, hermann, heights, monument, a, similar, statue, erected, in, new, ulm, minnesota, in, the, united, states, in, 1897, the, hermann, heights, monument, was, erected, by, the, sons, of, hermann, a, fraternal, organization, formed, by, german, americans, in, new, york, city, in, 1840, that, flourished, during, the, 19th, century, in, american, cities, with, large, populations, of, german, origin, hermann, missouri, a, town, on, the, missouri, river, founded, in, the, 1830s, and, incorporated, in, 1845, was, also, named, for, arminius, following, the, rise, of, nazi, germany, fueled, by, aggressive, german, nationalism, and, its, subsequent, defeat, in, world, war, ii, arminius, became, a, lesser, known, figure, among, west, germans, and, many, schools, shied, away, from, teaching, his, story, in, any, detail, due, to, its, previous, association, with, nationalism, there, was, however, a, somewhat, different, perception, in, east, germany, in, east, germany, arminius, based, on, a, marxist, reading, of, history, came, to, be, seen, as, a, revolutionary, figure, of, sorts, leading, german, tribes, in, a, fight, against, the, roman, slaveholder, society, sklavenhaltergesellschaft, in, the, context, of, the, cold, war, arminius, was, interpreted, as, symbolic, of, socialism, with, rome, being, a, symbol, of, the, capitalist, united, states, as, an, oppressive, empire, according, to, journalist, david, crossland, the, old, nationalism, has, been, replaced, by, an, easy, going, patriotism, that, mainly, manifests, itself, at, sporting, events, like, the, soccer, world, cup, the, german, bundesliga, football, club, dsc, arminia, bielefeld, is, named, after, arminius, the, 2, 000, year, anniversary, of, the, battle, was, also, celebrated, in, new, ulm, minnesota, without, restraint, there, were, mock, battles, between, romans, and, club, wielding, barbarians, and, also, a, lecture, series, in, an, auditorium, fictional, versions, of, arminius, appear, in, the, football, soccer, team, dsc, arminia, bielefeld, is, named, after, arminius
