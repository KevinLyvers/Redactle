to, his, work, the, fundaci, joan, mir, was, established, in, his, native, city, of, barcelona, in, 1975, and, another, the, fundaci, pilar, i, joan, mir, was, established, in, his, adoptive, city, of, palma, in, 1981, earning, international, acclaim, his, work, has, been, interpreted, as, surrealism, but, with, a, personal, style, sometimes, also, veering, into, fauvism, and, expressionism, he, was, notable, for, his, interest, in, the, unconscious, or, the, subconscious, mind, reflected, in, his, re, creation, of, the, childlike, his, difficult, to, classify, works, also, had, a, manifestation, of, catalan, pride, in, numerous, interviews, dating, from, the, 1930s, onwards, mir, expressed, contempt, for, conventional, painting, methods, as, a, way, of, supporting, bourgeois, society, and, declared, an, assassination, of, painting, in, favour, of, upsetting, the, visual, elements, of, established, painting, born, into, a, family, of, a, goldsmith, and, watchmaker, miquel, mir, adzerias, and, mother, dolores, ferr, mir, grew, up, in, the, barri, g, tic, neighborhood, of, barcelona, the, mir, surname, indicates, some, possible, jewish, roots, in, terms, of, marrano, or, converso, iberian, jews, who, converted, to, christianity, he, began, drawing, classes, at, the, age, of, seven, at, a, private, school, at, carrer, del, regomir, 13, a, medieval, mansion, to, the, dismay, of, his, father, he, enrolled, at, the, fine, art, academy, at, la, llotja, in, 1907, he, studied, at, the, cercle, art, stic, de, sant, lluc, and, he, had, his, first, solo, show, in, 1918, at, the, galeries, dalmau, where, his, work, was, ridiculed, and, defaced, inspired, by, fauve, and, cubist, exhibitions, in, barcelona, and, abroad, mir, was, drawn, towards, the, arts, community, that, was, gathering, in, montparnasse, and, in, 1920, moved, to, paris, but, continued, to, spend, his, summers, in, catalonia, mir, initially, went, to, business, school, as, well, as, art, school, he, began, his, working, career, as, a, clerk, when, he, was, a, teenager, although, he, abandoned, the, business, world, completely, for, art, after, suffering, a, nervous, breakdown, his, early, art, like, that, of, the, similarly, influenced, fauves, and, cubists, was, inspired, by, vincent, van, gogh, and, paul, c, zanne, the, resemblance, of, mir, s, work, to, that, of, the, intermediate, generation, of, the, avant, garde, has, led, scholars, to, dub, this, period, his, catalan, fauvist, period, a, few, years, after, mir, s, 1918, barcelona, solo, exhibition, he, settled, in, paris, where, he, finished, a, number, of, paintings, that, he, had, begun, on, his, parents, summer, home, and, farm, in, mont, roig, del, camp, one, such, painting, the, farm, showed, a, transition, to, a, more, individual, style, of, painting, and, certain, nationalistic, qualities, ernest, hemingway, who, later, purchased, the, piece, described, it, by, saying, it, has, in, it, all, that, you, feel, about, spain, when, you, are, there, and, all, that, you, feel, when, you, are, away, and, cannot, go, there, no, one, else, has, been, able, to, paint, these, two, very, opposing, things, mir, annually, returned, to, mont, roig, and, developed, a, symbolism, and, nationalism, that, would, stick, with, him, throughout, his, career, two, of, mir, s, first, works, classified, as, surrealist, catalan, landscape, the, hunter, and, the, tilled, field, employ, the, symbolic, language, that, was, to, dominate, the, art, of, the, next, decade, josep, dalmau, arranged, mir, s, first, parisian, solo, exhibition, at, galerie, la, licorne, in, 1921, in, 1924, mir, joined, the, surrealist, group, the, already, symbolic, and, poetic, nature, of, mir, s, work, as, well, as, the, dualities, and, contradictions, inherent, to, it, fit, well, within, the, context, of, dream, like, automatism, espoused, by, the, group, much, of, mir, s, work, lost, the, cluttered, chaotic, lack, of, focus, that, had, defined, his, work, thus, far, and, he, experimented, with, collage, and, the, process, of, painting, within, his, work, so, as, to, reject, the, framing, that, traditional, painting, provided, this, antagonistic, attitude, towards, painting, manifested, itself, when, mir, referred, to, his, work, in, 1924, ambiguously, as, x, in, a, letter, to, poet, friend, michel, leiris, the, paintings, that, came, out, of, this, period, were, eventually, dubbed, mir, s, dream, paintings, mir, did, not, completely, abandon, subject, matter, though, despite, the, surrealist, automatic, techniques, that, he, employed, extensively, in, the, 1920s, sketches, show, that, his, work, was, often, the, result, of, a, methodical, process, mir, s, work, rarely, dipped, into, non, objectivity, maintaining, a, symbolic, schematic, language, this, was, perhaps, most, prominent, in, the, repeated, head, of, a, catalan, peasant, series, of, 1924, to, 1925, in, 1926, he, collaborated, with, max, ernst, on, designs, for, ballet, impresario, sergei, diaghilev, mir, returned, to, a, more, representational, form, of, painting, with, the, dutch, interiors, of, 1928, crafted, after, works, by, hendrik, martenszoon, sorgh, and, jan, steen, seen, as, postcard, reproductions, the, paintings, reveal, the, influence, of, a, trip, to, holland, taken, by, the, artist, these, paintings, share, more, in, common, with, tilled, field, or, harlequin, s, carnival, than, with, the, minimalistic, dream, paintings, produced, a, few, years, earlier, mir, married, pilar, juncosa, in, palma, majorca, on, 12, october, 1929, their, daughter, mar, a, dolores, mir, was, born, on, 17, july, 1930, in, 1931, pierre, matisse, opened, an, art, gallery, in, new, york, city, the, pierre, matisse, gallery, which, existed, until, matisse, s, death, in, 1989, became, an, influential, part, of, the, modern, art, movement, in, america, from, the, outset, matisse, represented, joan, mir, and, introduced, his, work, to, the, united, states, market, by, frequently, exhibiting, mir, s, work, in, new, york, in, 1932, he, created, a, scenic, design, for, massine, s, ballet, jeux, d, enfants, at, ballet, russe, de, monte, carlo, until, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, civil, war, mir, habitually, returned, to, spain, in, the, summers, once, the, war, began, he, was, unable, to, return, home, unlike, many, of, his, surrealist, contemporaries, mir, had, previously, preferred, to, stay, away, from, explicitly, political, commentary, in, his, work, though, a, sense, of, catalan, nationalism, pervaded, his, earliest, surreal, landscapes, and, head, of, a, catalan, peasant, it, was, not, until, spain, s, republican, government, commissioned, him, to, paint, the, mural, the, reaper, for, the, spanish, republican, pavilion, at, the, 1937, paris, exhibition, that, mir, s, work, took, on, a, politically, charged, meaning, in, 1939, with, germany, s, invasion, of, france, looming, mir, relocated, to, varengeville, in, normandy, and, on, 20, may, of, the, following, year, as, germans, invaded, paris, he, narrowly, fled, to, spain, now, controlled, by, francisco, franco, for, the, duration, of, the, vichy, regime, s, rule, in, varengeville, palma, and, mont, roig, between, 1940, and, 1941, mir, created, the, twenty, three, gouache, series, constellations, revolving, around, celestial, symbolism, constellations, earned, the, artist, praise, from, andr, breton, who, seventeen, years, later, wrote, a, series, of, poems, named, after, and, inspired, by, mir, s, series, features, of, this, work, revealed, a, shifting, focus, to, the, subjects, of, women, birds, and, the, moon, which, would, dominate, his, iconography, for, much, of, the, rest, of, his, career, shuzo, takiguchi, published, the, first, monograph, on, mir, in, 1940, in, 1948, 49, mir, lived, in, barcelona, and, made, frequent, visits, to, paris, to, work, on, printing, techniques, at, the, mourlot, studios, and, the, atelier, lacouri, re, he, developed, a, close, relationship, with, fernand, mourlot, and, that, resulted, in, the, production, of, over, one, thousand, different, lithographic, editions, in, 1959, andr, breton, asked, mir, to, represent, spain, in, the, homage, to, surrealism, exhibition, alongside, enrique, t, bara, salvador, dal, and, eugenio, granell, mir, created, a, series, of, sculptures, and, ceramics, for, the, garden, of, the, maeght, foundation, in, saint, paul, de, vence, france, which, was, completed, in, 1964, in, 1974, mir, created, a, tapestry, for, the, world, trade, center, in, new, york, city, together, with, the, catalan, artist, josep, royo, he, had, initially, refused, to, do, a, tapestry, then, he, learned, the, craft, from, royo, and, the, two, artists, produced, several, works, together, his, world, trade, center, tapestry, was, displayed, at, the, building, and, was, one, of, the, most, expensive, works, of, art, lost, during, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 1977, mir, and, royo, finished, a, tapestry, to, be, exhibited, in, the, national, gallery, of, art, in, washington, dc, in, 1981, mir, s, the, sun, the, moon, and, one, star, later, renamed, mir, s, chicago, was, unveiled, this, large, mixed, media, sculpture, is, situated, outdoors, in, the, downtown, loop, area, of, chicago, across, the, street, from, another, large, public, sculpture, the, chicago, picasso, mir, had, created, a, bronze, model, of, the, sun, the, moon, and, one, star, in, 1967, the, maquette, now, resides, in, the, milwaukee, art, museum, in, 1979, mir, received, a, doctorate, honoris, causa, from, the, university, of, barcelona, the, artist, who, suffered, from, heart, failure, died, in, his, home, in, palma, majorca, on, 25, december, 1983, at, age, 90, he, was, later, interred, in, the, montju, c, cemetery, in, barcelona, mir, had, many, episodes, of, depression, throughout, his, life, he, experienced, his, first, depression, when, he, was, 18, in, 1911, mir, said, i, was, demoralized, and, suffered, from, a, serious, depression, i, fell, really, ill, and, stayed, three, months, in, bed, he, used, painting, as, a, way, of, dealing, with, depression, and, it, supposedly, made, him, calmer, his, thoughts, less, dark, mir, said, that, without, painting, he, became, very, depressed, gloomy, and, i, get, black, ideas, and, i, do, not, know, what, to, do, with, myself, his, mental, state, is, visible, in, his, painting, carnival, of, the, harlequin, he, tried, to, paint, the, chaos, he, experienced, in, his, mind, the, desperation, of, wanting, to, leave, that, chaos, behind, and, the, pain, created, because, of, that, mir, painted, the, symbol, of, the, ladder, here, which, is, also, visible, in, multiple, other, paintings, after, this, painting, it, is, supposed, to, symbolize, escaping, the, relation, between, creativity, and, mental, illness, is, very, well, studied, it, has, been, argued, that, creative, people, have, a, higher, chance, of, suffering, from, a, manic, depressive, illness, or, schizophrenia, as, well, as, higher, chance, of, transmitting, this, genetically, even, though, we, know, mir, suffered, from, episodic, depression, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, also, experienced, manic, episodes, which, is, often, referred, to, as, bipolar, disorder, his, early, modernist, works, include, portrait, of, vincent, nubiola, 1917, siurana, the, path, nord, sud, 1917, and, painting, of, toledo, these, works, show, the, influence, of, c, zanne, and, fill, the, canvas, with, a, colorful, surface, and, a, more, painterly, treatment, than, the, hard, edge, style, of, most, of, his, later, works, in, nord, sud, the, literary, newspaper, of, that, name, appears, in, the, still, life, a, compositional, device, common, in, cubist, compositions, but, also, a, reference, to, the, literary, and, avant, garde, interests, of, the, painter, starting, in, 1920, mir, developed, a, very, precise, style, picking, out, every, element, in, isolation, and, detail, and, arranging, them, in, deliberate, composition, these, works, including, house, with, palm, tree, 1918, nude, with, a, mirror, 1919, horse, pipe, and, red, flower, 1920, and, the, table, still, life, with, rabbit, 1920, show, the, clear, influence, of, cubism, although, in, a, restrained, way, being, applied, to, only, a, portion, of, the, subject, for, example, the, farmer, s, wife, 1922, 23, is, realistic, but, some, sections, are, stylized, or, deformed, such, as, the, treatment, of, the, woman, s, feet, which, are, enlarged, and, flattened, the, culmination, of, this, style, was, the, farm, 1921, 22, the, rural, catalan, scene, it, depicts, is, augmented, by, an, avant, garde, french, newspaper, in, the, center, showing, mir, sees, this, work, transformed, by, the, modernist, theories, he, had, been, exposed, to, in, paris, the, concentration, on, each, element, as, equally, important, was, a, key, step, towards, generating, a, pictorial, sign, for, each, element, the, background, is, rendered, in, flat, or, patterned, in, simple, areas, highlighting, the, separation, of, figure, and, ground, which, would, become, important, in, his, mature, style, mir, made, many, attempts, to, promote, this, work, but, his, surrealist, colleagues, found, it, too, realistic, and, apparently, conventional, and, so, he, soon, turned, to, a, more, explicitly, surrealist, approach, in, 1922, mir, explored, abstracted, strongly, coloured, surrealism, in, at, least, one, painting, from, the, summer, of, 1923, in, mont, roig, mir, began, a, key, set, of, paintings, where, abstracted, pictorial, signs, rather, than, the, realistic, representations, used, in, the, farm, are, predominant, in, the, tilled, field, catalan, landscape, the, hunter, and, pastoral, 1923, 24, these, flat, shapes, and, lines, mostly, black, or, strongly, coloured, suggest, the, subjects, sometimes, quite, cryptically, for, catalan, landscape, the, hunter, mir, represents, the, hunter, with, a, combination, of, signs, a, triangle, for, the, head, curved, lines, for, the, moustache, angular, lines, for, the, body, so, encoded, is, this, work, that, at, a, later, time, mir, provided, a, precise, explanation, of, the, signs, used, through, the, mid, 1920s, mir, developed, the, pictorial, sign, language, which, would, be, central, throughout, the, rest, of, his, career, in, harlequin, s, carnival, 1924, 25, there, is, a, clear, continuation, of, the, line, begun, with, the, tilled, field, but, in, subsequent, works, such, as, the, happiness, of, loving, my, brunette, 1925, and, painting, fratellini, 1927, there, are, far, fewer, foreground, figures, and, those, that, remain, are, simplified, soon, after, mir, also, began, his, spanish, dancer, series, of, works, these, simple, collages, were, like, a, conceptual, counterpoint, to, his, paintings, in, spanish, dancer, 1928, he, combines, a, cork, a, feather, and, a, hatpin, onto, a, blank, sheet, of, paper, mir, created, over, 250, illustrated, books, these, were, known, as, livres, d, artiste, one, such, work, was, published, in, 1974, at, the, urging, of, the, widow, of, the, french, poet, robert, desnos, titled, les, p, nalit, s, de, l, enfer, ou, les, nouvelles, h, brides, the, penalties, of, hell, or, the, new, hebrides, it, was, a, set, of, 25, lithographs, five, in, black, and, the, others, in, colors, in, 2006, the, book, was, displayed, in, joan, mir, illustrated, books, at, the, vero, beach, museum, of, art, one, critic, said, it, is, an, especially, powerful, set, not, only, for, the, rich, imagery, but, also, for, the, story, behind, the, book, s, creation, the, lithographs, are, long, narrow, verticals, and, while, they, feature, mir, s, familiar, shapes, there, s, an, unusual, emphasis, on, texture, the, critic, continued, i, was, instantly, attracted, to, these, four, prints, to, an, emotional, lushness, that, s, in, contrast, with, the, cool, surfaces, of, so, much, of, mir, s, work, their, poignancy, is, even, greater, i, think, when, you, read, how, they, came, to, be, the, artist, met, and, became, friends, with, desnos, perhaps, the, most, beloved, and, influential, surrealist, writer, in, 1925, and, before, long, they, made, plans, to, collaborate, on, a, livre, d, artiste, those, plans, were, put, on, hold, because, of, the, spanish, civil, war, and, world, war, ii, desnos, bold, criticism, of, the, latter, led, to, his, imprisonment, in, auschwitz, and, he, died, at, age, 45, shortly, after, his, release, in, 1945, nearly, three, decades, later, at, the, suggestion, of, desnos, widow, mir, set, out, to, illustrate, the, poet, s, manuscript, it, was, his, first, work, in, prose, which, was, written, in, morocco, in, 1922, but, remained, unpublished, until, this, posthumous, collaboration, in, paris, under, the, influence, of, poets, and, writers, he, developed, his, unique, style, organic, forms, and, flattened, picture, planes, drawn, with, a, sharp, line, generally, thought, of, as, a, surrealist, because, of, his, interest, in, automatism, and, the, use, of, sexual, symbols, for, example, ovoids, with, wavy, lines, emanating, from, them, mir, s, style, was, influenced, in, varying, degrees, by, surrealism, and, dada, yet, he, rejected, membership, in, any, artistic, movement, in, the, interwar, european, years, andr, breton, described, him, as, the, most, surrealist, of, us, all, mir, confessed, to, creating, one, of, his, most, famous, works, harlequin, s, carnival, under, similar, circumstances, how, did, i, think, up, my, drawings, and, my, ideas, for, painting, well, i, d, come, home, to, my, paris, studio, in, rue, blomet, at, night, i, d, go, to, bed, and, sometimes, i, hadn, t, any, supper, i, saw, things, and, i, jotted, them, down, in, a, notebook, i, saw, shapes, on, the, ceiling, mir, s, surrealist, origins, evolved, out, of, repression, much, like, all, spanish, surrealist, and, magic, realist, work, especially, because, of, his, catalan, ethnicity, which, was, subject, to, special, persecution, by, the, franco, regime, he, drew, on, catalan, folk, art, such, as, siurells, which, he, claimed, to, observe, constantly, also, joan, mir, was, well, aware, of, haitian, voodoo, art, and, cuban, santer, a, religion, through, his, travels, before, going, into, exile, this, led, to, his, signature, style, of, art, making, joan, mir, was, among, the, first, artists, to, develop, automatic, drawing, as, a, way, to, undo, previous, established, techniques, in, painting, and, thus, with, andr, masson, represented, the, beginning, of, surrealism, as, an, art, movement, however, mir, chose, not, to, become, an, official, member, of, the, surrealists, to, be, free, to, experiment, with, other, artistic, styles, without, compromising, his, position, within, the, group, he, pursued, his, own, interests, in, the, art, world, ranging, from, automatic, drawing, and, surrealism, to, expressionism, lyrical, abstraction, and, color, field, painting, four, dimensional, painting, was, a, theoretical, type, of, painting, mir, proposed, in, which, painting, would, transcend, its, two, dimensionality, and, even, the, three, dimensionality, of, sculpture, mir, s, oft, quoted, interest, in, the, assassination, of, painting, is, derived, from, a, dislike, of, bourgeois, art, which, he, believed, was, used, as, a, way, to, promote, propaganda, and, cultural, identity, among, the, wealthy, specifically, mir, responded, to, cubism, in, this, way, which, by, the, time, of, his, quote, had, become, an, established, art, form, in, france, he, is, quoted, as, saying, i, will, break, their, guitar, referring, to, picasso, s, paintings, with, the, intent, to, attack, the, popularity, and, appropriation, of, picasso, s, art, by, politics, the, spectacle, of, the, sky, overwhelms, me, i, m, overwhelmed, when, i, see, in, an, immense, sky, the, crescent, of, the, moon, or, the, sun, there, in, my, pictures, tiny, forms, in, huge, empty, spaces, empty, spaces, empty, horizons, empty, plains, everything, which, is, bare, has, always, greatly, impressed, me, joan, mir, 1958, quoted, in, twentieth, century, artists, on, art, in, an, interview, with, biographer, walter, erben, mir, expressed, his, dislike, for, art, critics, saying, they, are, more, concerned, with, being, philosophers, than, anything, else, they, form, a, preconceived, opinion, then, they, look, at, the, work, of, art, painting, merely, serves, as, a, cloak, in, which, to, wrap, their, emaciated, philosophical, systems, in, the, final, decades, of, his, life, mir, accelerated, his, work, in, different, media, producing, hundreds, of, ceramics, including, the, wall, of, the, moon, and, wall, of, the, sun, at, the, unesco, building, in, paris, he, also, made, temporary, window, paintings, on, glass, for, an, exhibit, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, mir, wrote, his, most, radical, and, least, known, ideas, exploring, the, possibilities, of, gas, sculpture, and, four, dimensional, painting, throughout, the, 1960s, mir, was, a, featured, artist, in, many, salon, shows, assembled, by, the, maeght, foundation, that, also, included, works, by, marc, chagall, giacometti, brach, cesar, ubac, and, tal, coat, the, large, retrospectives, devoted, to, mir, in, his, old, age, in, places, like, new, york, 1972, london, 1972, saint, paul, de, vence, 1973, and, paris, 1974, were, a, good, indication, of, the, international, acclaim, that, had, grown, steadily, over, the, previous, half, century, further, major, retrospectives, took, place, posthumously, political, changes, in, his, native, country, led, in, 1978, to, the, first, full, exhibition, of, his, painting, and, graphic, work, at, the, museo, nacional, centro, de, arte, reina, sof, a, in, madrid, in, 1993, the,
