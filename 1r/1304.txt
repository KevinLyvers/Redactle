open, and, went, to, see, it, regularly, patting, it, and, taking, no, notice, of, the, putrefaction, they, tried, to, persuade, maria, not, to, visit, the, corpse, so, often, axel, oxenstierna, managed, to, have, the, corpse, interred, in, riddarholmen, church, on, 22, june, 1634, but, had, to, post, guards, after, she, tried, to, dig, it, up, maria, eleanora, had, been, indifferent, to, her, daughter, but, after, gustav, adolf, s, death, christina, became, the, center, of, her, mother, s, attention, gustav, adolf, had, decided, that, in, the, event, of, his, death, his, daughter, should, be, cared, for, by, his, half, sister, catherine, of, sweden, and, half, brother, carl, gyllenhielm, as, regent, this, solution, did, not, suit, maria, eleonora, who, had, her, sister, in, law, banned, from, the, castle, in, 1634, the, instrument, of, government, a, new, constitution, was, introduced, by, oxenstierna, the, constitution, stipulated, that, the, king, must, have, a, privy, council, which, oxenstierna, himself, headed, maria, eleonora, was, considered, very, difficult, and, in, 1636, she, lost, her, parental, rights, to, her, daughter, the, riksr, d, justified, its, decision, by, asserting, that, she, neglected, christina, and, her, upbringing, and, that, she, had, a, bad, influence, on, her, daughter, chancellor, oxenstierna, saw, no, other, solution, than, to, exile, the, widow, to, gripsholm, castle, while, the, governing, regency, council, would, decide, when, she, was, allowed, to, see, her, daughter, for, the, subsequent, years, christina, thrived, in, the, company, of, her, aunt, catherine, and, her, family, in, 1638, after, the, death, of, her, aunt, and, foster, mother, the, royal, regency, council, under, axel, oxenstierna, saw, the, need, to, appoint, a, new, foster, mother, to, the, underage, monarch, which, resulted, in, a, reorganization, of, the, queen, s, household, to, prevent, the, young, queen, from, being, dependent, upon, a, single, individual, and, favorite, mother, figure, the, royal, council, decided, to, split, the, office, of, head, lady, in, waiting, responsible, for, the, queen, s, female, courtiers, and, the, office, royal, governess, or, foster, mother, in, four, with, two, women, appointed, to, share, each, office, accordingly, ebba, leijonhufvud, and, christina, natt, och, dag, were, appointed, to, share, the, position, of, royal, governess, and, foster, mother, with, the, title, upptuktelse, f, rest, nderska, castigation, mistress, while, beata, oxenstierna, and, ebba, ryning, were, appointed, to, share, the, position, of, head, lady, in, waiting, all, four, with, the, formal, rank, and, title, of, hovm, starinna, the, royal, council, s, method, of, giving, queen, christina, several, foster, mothers, to, avoid, her, forming, an, attachment, to, a, single, person, appears, to, have, been, effective, as, christina, did, not, mention, her, foster, mothers, directly, in, her, memoirs, and, did, not, seem, to, have, formed, an, attachment, to, any, of, them, in, fact, with, only, a, few, exceptions, including, ebba, sparre, lady, jane, ruthven, and, louise, van, der, nooth, christina, did, not, show, any, interest, in, any, of, her, female, courtiers, she, generally, mentions, them, in, her, memoirs, only, to, compare, herself, favorably, toward, them, by, referring, to, herself, as, more, masculine, than, they, christina, was, educated, as, a, royal, male, would, have, been, the, theologian, johannes, matthiae, gothus, became, her, tutor, he, gave, her, lessons, in, religion, philosophy, greek, and, latin, chancellor, oxenstierna, taught, her, politics, and, discussed, tacitus, with, her, oxenstierna, proudly, wrote, of, the, 14, year, old, girl, that, she, is, not, at, all, like, a, female, and, had, a, bright, intelligence, christina, seemed, happy, to, study, ten, hours, a, day, besides, swedish, and, german, she, learned, at, least, six, more, languages, dutch, danish, french, italian, arabic, and, hebrew, in, 1644, at, the, age, of, 18, christina, was, declared, an, adult, although, the, coronation, was, postponed, because, of, the, torstenson, war, she, was, visited, by, a, group, of, dutch, diplomats, including, johan, de, witt, to, find, a, solution, for, the, sound, dues, in, the, treaty, of, br, msebro, signed, at, a, creek, in, blekinge, denmark, added, the, isles, of, gotland, and, sel, to, christina, s, domain, while, norway, lost, the, districts, of, j, mtland, and, h, rjedalen, to, her, under, christina, s, rule, sweden, virtually, controlling, the, baltic, sea, had, unrestricted, access, to, the, north, sea, and, was, no, longer, encircled, by, denmark, norway, chancellor, oxenstierna, soon, discovered, that, her, political, views, differed, from, his, own, in, 1645, he, sent, his, son, johan, oxenstierna, to, the, peace, congress, in, the, westphalian, city, of, osnabr, ck, to, argue, against, peace, with, the, holy, roman, empire, christina, however, wanted, peace, at, any, cost, and, sent, her, own, delegate, johan, adler, salvius, the, peace, of, westphalia, was, signed, in, october, 1648, effectively, ending, the, european, wars, of, religion, sweden, received, an, indemnity, of, five, million, thalers, used, primarily, to, pay, its, troops, sweden, further, received, western, pomerania, henceforth, swedish, pomerania, wismar, the, archbishopric, of, bremen, and, the, bishopric, of, verden, as, hereditary, fiefs, thus, gaining, a, seat, and, vote, in, the, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, in, the, respective, diets, kreistage, of, three, imperial, circles, the, upper, saxon, circle, lower, saxon, circle, and, lower, rhenish, westphalian, circle, the, city, of, bremen, was, disputed, shortly, before, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, settlement, she, admitted, salvius, into, the, council, against, oxenstierna, s, wishes, salvius, was, no, aristocrat, but, christina, wanted, the, opposition, to, the, aristocracy, present, in, 1649, with, the, help, of, her, uncle, john, casimir, christina, tried, to, reduce, the, influence, of, oxenstierna, when, she, declared, her, cousin, charles, gustav, as, her, heir, presumptive, the, following, year, christina, resisted, demands, from, the, other, estates, clergy, burghers, and, peasants, in, the, riksdag, of, the, estates, for, the, reduction, of, the, number, of, noble, landholdings, that, were, tax, exempt, she, never, implemented, such, a, policy, in, 1649, louis, de, geer, founded, the, swedish,

a, new, church, order, but, it, was, voted, down, as, this, was, interpreted, as, crypto, calvinism, queen, christina, defended, him, against, the, advice, of, chancellor, oxenstierna, but, three, years, later, the, proposal, had, to, be, withdrawn, in, 1647, the, clergy, wanted, to, introduce, the, book, of, concord, swedish, konkordieboken, a, book, defining, correct, lutheranism, versus,

confirmed, that, they, existed, christina, never, revealed, what, was, in, the, letters, but, according, to, le, bel, it, is, supposed, to, have, dealt, with, her, amours, either, with, monaldeschi, or, another, person, she, herself, wrote, her, version, of, the, story, for, circulation, in, europe, the, killing, of, monaldeschi, in, a, french, palace, was, legal, since, christina, had, judicial, rights, over, the, members, of, her, court, as, her, vindicator, gottfried, leibniz, claimed, as, her, contemporaries, saw, it, christina, as, queen, had, to, emphasize, right, and, wrong, and, her,

s, early, involvement, with, italian, music, and, in, particular, church, music, from, rome, was, part, of, a, deliberate, self, transformation, from, a, ruling, lutheran, regent, to, a, catholic, queen, without, a, land, christina, s, politics, and, rebellious, spirit, persisted, long, after, her, abdication, of, power, when, louis, xiv, revoked, the, edict, of, nantes, abolishing, the, rights, of, french, protestants, huguenots, christina, wrote, an, indignant, letter, dated, 2, february, 1686, directed, at, the, french, ambassador, cesar, d, estrees, louis, did, not, appreciate, her, views, but, christina, was, not, to, be, silenced, in, rome, she, made, pope, clement, x, prohibit, the, custom, of, chasing, jews, through, the, streets, during, the, carnival, on, 15, august, 1686, she, issued, a, declaration, that, roman, jews, were, under, her, protection, signed, la, regina, the, queen, christina, remained, very, tolerant, towards, the, beliefs, of, others, all, her, life, she, on, her, part, felt, more, attracted, to, the, views, of, the, spanish, priest, miguel, molinos, whom, she, employed, as, a, private, theologian, he, had, been, investigated, by, the, holy, inquisition, for, proclaiming, that, sin, belonged, to, the, lower, sensual, part, of, man, and, was, not, subject, to, man, s, free, will, christina, sent, him, food, and, hundreds, of, letters, when, he, was, locked, up, in, castel, sant, angelo, in, february, 1689, the, 62, year, old, christina, fell, seriously, ill, after, a, visit, to, the, temples, in, campania, and, received, the, last, rites, she, suffered, from, diabetes, mellitus, christina, seemed, to, recover, but, in, the, middle, of, april, she, developed, an, acute, streptococcus, bacterial, infection, known, as, erysipelas, then, contracted, pneumonia, and, a, high, fever, on, her, deathbed, she, sent, the, pope, a, message, asking, if, he, could, forgive, her, insults, she, died, on, 19, april, 1689, in, palazzo, corsini, at, six, in, the, morning, christina, had, asked, for, a, simple, burial, in, the, pantheon, rome, but, the, pope, insisted, on, her, being, displayed, on, a, lit, de, parade, for, four, days, in, the, riario, palace, she, was, embalmed, covered, with, white, brocade, a, silver, mask, a, gilt, crown, and, a, scepter, the, queen, wore, a, thin, mantle, decorated, with, hundreds, of, crowns, and, fur, bordered, with, ermine, under, this, a, splendid, garment, in, two, pieces, thin, gloves, and, drawers, of, knitted, silk, and, a, pair, of, elegant, textile, bootees, in, similar, fashion, to, the, popes, her, body, was, placed, in, three, coffins, one, of, cypress, one, of, lead, and, finally, one, made, of, oak, the, funeral, procession, on, 2, may, led, from, santa, maria, in, vallicella, to, st, peter, s, basilica, where, she, was, buried, within, the, vatican, grottoes, one, of, only, three, women, ever, given, this, honor, the, other, two, being, matilda, of, tuscany, and, maria, clementina, sobieska, her, intestines, were, placed, in, a, high, urn, in, 1702, clement, xi, commissioned, a, monument, for, the, queen, in, whose, conversion, he, vainly, foresaw, a, return, of, her, country, to, the, faith, and, to, whose, contribution, towards, the, culture, of, the, city, he, looked, back, with, gratitude, this, monument, was, placed, in, the, body, of, the, basilica, and, directed, by, the, artist, carlo, fontana, christina, had, named, azzolino, her, sole, heir, to, make, sure, her, debts, were, settled, but, he, was, too, ill, and, worn, out, even, to, join, her, funeral, and, died, in, june, the, same, year, his, nephew, pompeo, azzolino, was, his, sole, heir, and, he, rapidly, sold, off, christina, s, art, collections, until, 1649, when, christina, was, twenty, three, the, swedish, royal, art, collection, was, unimpressive, with, good, tapestries, but, for, paintings, little, more, than, about, a, hundred, works, by, minor, german, flemish, and, swedish, painters, but, in, may, 1649, the, fabulous, loot, from, the, occupation, of, prague, castle, the, previous, year, arrived, with, the, pick, of, the, collection, amassed, by, the, obsessive, collector, rudolph, ii, holy, roman, emperor, 1552, 1612, one, of, the, most, important, in, europe, rudolf, s, bulk, purchases, had, included, the, famous, collection, of, emperor, charles, v, s, leading, minister, cardinal, granvelle, 1517, 1586, which, he, had, forced, granvelle, s, nephew, and, heir, to, sell, to, him, granvelle, had, been, the, greatest, private, collector, of, his, time, the, friend, and, patron, of, titian, and, leoni, and, many, other, artists, christina, was, entranced, by, her, new, possessions, and, remained, a, keen, collector, for, the, rest, of, her, life, and, as, a, female, art, collector, is, only, exceeded, by, catherine, the, great, of, russia, in, the, early, modern, period, rudolf, had, collected, old, and, contemporary, works, from, both, italy, and, northern, europe, but, it, was, the, italian, paintings, that, excited, christina, and, by, her, death, her, collection, contained, relatively, few, northern, works, other, than, portraits, most, of, the, prague, booty, remained, in, sweden, after, christina, s, departure, for, exile, she, only, took, about, 70, to, 80, paintings, with, her, including, about, 25, portraits, of, her, friends, and, family, and, some, 50, paintings, mostly, italian, from, the, prague, loot, as, well, as, statues, jewels, 72, tapestries, and, various, other, works, of, art, she, was, concerned, that, the, royal, collections, would, be, claimed, by, her, successor, and, prudently, sent, them, ahead, to, antwerp, in, a, ship, in, august, 1653, almost, a, year, before, she, abdicated, an, early, sign, of, her, intentions, christina, greatly, expanded, her, collection, during, her, exile, in, rome, for, example, adding, the, five, small, raphael, predella, panels, from, the, colonna, altarpiece, including, the, agony, in, the, garden, now, reunited, with, the, main, panel, in, new, york, which, were, bought, from, a, convent, near, rome, she, was, apparently, given, titian, s, death, of, actaeon, by, the, greatest, collector, of, the, age, archduke, leopold, william, of, austria, viceroy, in, brussels, she, received, many, such, gifts, from, catholic, royalty, after, her, conversion, and, gave, some, generous, gifts, herself, notably, albrecht, d, rer, s, panels, of, adam, and, eve, to, philip, iv, of, spain, now, prado, likewise, seven, marble, statues, of, the, muses, she, acquired, from, hadrian, s, villa, in, 1670, she, also, gave, away, two, paintings, by, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, dull, gret, and, the, cripples, now, louvre, in, such, ways, the, balance, of, her, collection, shifted, to, italian, art, the, riario, palace, finally, provided, a, suitable, setting, for, her, collection, and, the, sala, dei, quadri, paintings, room, had, her, finest, works, with, thirteen, titians, and, eleven, veroneses, five, raphaels, and, several, correggios, titian, s, venus, anadyomene, was, among, them, venus, mourns, adonis, by, veronese, was, from, prague, and, is, now, back, in, sweden, nationalmuseum, christina, liked, to, commission, portraits, of, herself, friends, and, also, notable, people, she, had, not, met, from, 1647, sending, david, beck, her, dutch, court, painter, to, several, countries, to, paint, notabilities, she, encouraged, artists, to, study, her, collection, including, the, drawings, and, exhibited, some, of, her, paintings, but, apart, from, portraits, she, commissioned, or, bought, few, works, by, living, painters, except, for, drawings, sculptors, did, rather, better, and, bernini, was, a, friend, while, others, were, commissioned, to, restore, the, large, collection, of, classical, sculpture, which, she, had, begun, to, assemble, while, still, in, sweden, on, her, death, she, left, her, collection, to, cardinal, decio, azzolino, who, himself, died, within, a, year, leaving, the, collection, to, his, nephew, who, sold, it, to, don, livio, odescalchi, commander, of, the, papal, army, at, which, point, it, contained, 275, paintings, 140, of, them, italian, the, year, after, odescalchi, s, death, in, 1713, his, heirs, began, protracted, negotiations, with, the, great, french, connoisseur, and, collector, pierre, crozat, acting, as, intermediary, for, philippe, ii, duke, of, orl, ans, from, 1715, the, regent, of, france, the, sale, was, finally, concluded, and, the, 123, paintings, included, in, the, sale, were, delivered, in, 1721, forming, the, core, of, the, orleans, collection, the, paintings, from, which, were, mostly, sold, in, london, after, the, french, revolution, with, many, of, them, being, on, display, in, the, national, gallery, the, french, experts, complained, that, christina, had, cut, down, several, paintings, to, fit, her, ceilings, and, had, over, restored, some, of, the, best, works, especially, the, correggios, implicating, carlo, maratti, at, first, removing, her, collections, from, sweden, was, seen, as, a, great, loss, to, the, country, but, in, 1697, stockholm, castle, burned, down, with, the, loss, of, almost, everything, inside, so, they, would, have, been, destroyed, if, they, had, remained, there, today, very, few, major, works, from, her, collection, still, remain, in, the, country, the, sculpture, collection, was, sold, to, the, king, of, spain, and, mostly, remains, in, spanish, museums, and, palaces, her, large, and, important, library, was, bought, by, alexander, viii, for, the, vatican, library, while, most, of, the, paintings, ended, up, in, france, as, the, core, of, the, orleans, collection, many, remain, together, in, the, national, gallery, of, scotland, 1700, drawings, from, her, collection, among, them, works, by, michelangelo, 25, and, raphael, were, acquired, in, 1790, by, willem, anne, lestevenon, for, the, teylers, museum, in, haarlem, the, netherlands, historical, accounts, of, christina, include, regular, reference, to, her, physical, features, mannerisms, and, style, of, dress, christina, was, known, to, have, a, bent, back, a, deformed, chest, and, irregular, shoulders, some, historians, have, speculated, that, references, to, her, physical, attributes, may, be, over, represented, in, related, historiography, thus, giving, the, impression, that, this, was, of, greater, interest, to, her, contemporaries, than, was, actually, the, case, however, given, how, influential, christina, became, in, her, own, era, especially, for, those, in, rome, it, is, likely, her, style, and, mannerisms, were, at, least, of, general, interest, to, those, around, her, and, this, is, reflected, in, many, accounts, as, a, result, of, conflicting, and, unreliable, accounts, some, no, better, than, gossip, the, way, in, which, christina, is, described, even, today, is, a, matter, of, debate, according, to, christina, s, autobiography, the, midwives, at, her, birth, first, believed, her, to, be, a, boy, because, she, was, completely, hairy, and, had, a, coarse, and, strong, voice, such, ambiguity, did, not, end, with, her, birth, christina, made, cryptic, statements, about, her, constitution, and, body, throughout, her, life, christina, also, believed, a, wet, nurse, had, carelessly, dropped, her, to, the, floor, when, she, was, a, baby, a, shoulder, bone, broke, leaving, one, shoulder, higher, than, the, other, for, the, rest, of, her, life, a, number, of, her, contemporaries, made, reference, to, the, differing, height, of, her, shoulders, as, a, child, christina, s, mannerisms, could, probably, best, be, described, as, those, of, a, tomboy, her, father, insisted, she, should, receive, the, education, of, a, prince, and, some, have, interpreted, this, as, acceptance, on, the, part, of, the, king, that, she, had, masculine, features, or, that, there, was, some, form, of, gender, ambiguity, in, her, upbringing, she, was, educated, as, a, prince, and, was, taught, and, enjoyed, fencing, horse, riding, and, bear, hunting, she, was, said, to, have, preferred, these, masculine, hobbies, to, more, feminine, ones, as, an, adult, it, was, said, that, christina, walked, like, a, man, sat, and, rode, like, a, man, and, could, eat, and, swear, like, the, roughest, soldiers, christina, s, contemporary, john, bargrave, described, her, comportment, in, a, similar, fashion, but, said, witnesses, ascribed, her, style, more, to, childishness, or, madness, than, masculinity, when, she, arrived, in, rome, in, 1655, she, had, shaven, her, head, and, wore, a, big, dark, wig, by, 1665, according, to, edward, browne, she, regularly, wore, a, velvet, justacorps, cravat, and, peruke, man, s, wig, while, christina, may, not, have, been, alone, in, her, own, time, for, choosing, masculine, dress, leonora, christina, ulfeldt, for, example, was, known, for, dressing, the, same, way, she, also, had, physical, features, some, described, as, masculine, according, to, henry, ii, duke, of, guise, she, wears, men, s, shoes, and, her, voice, and, nearly, all, her, actions, are, masculine, when, she, arrived, in, lyon, she, again, wore, a, toque, and, had, styled, her, hair, like, that, of, a, young, man, it, was, noted, that, she, also, wore, large, amounts, of, powder, and, face, cream, in, one, account, she, was, sunburnt, and, she, looked, like, a, sort, of, egyptian, street, girl, very, strange, and, more, alarming, than, attractive, living, in, rome, she, formed, a, close, relationship, with, cardinal, azzolino, which, was, controversial, but, symbolic, of, her, attraction, to, relationships, that, were, not, typical, for, a, woman, of, her, era, and, station, she, abandoned, her, manly, clothes, and, took, to, wearing, d, collet, dresses, so, risqu, that, they, drew, a, rebuke, from, the, pope, as, an, older, woman, christina, s, style, changed, a, little, fran, ois, maximilian, misson, visiting, rome, in, the, spring, of, april, 1688, wrote, she, is, over, sixty, years, of, age, very, small, of, stature, exceedingly, fat, and, corpulent, her, complexion, and, voice, and, face, are, those, of, a, man, she, has, a, big, nose, large, blue, eyes, blonde, eyebrows, and, a, double, chin, from, which, sprout, several, tufts, of, beard, her, upper, lip, protrudes, a, little, her, hair, is, a, light, chestnut, colour, and, only, a, palms, breadth, in, length, she, wears, it, powdered, and, standing, on, end, uncombed, she, is, very, smiling, and, obliging, you, will, hardly, believe, her, clothes, a, man, s, jacket, in, black, satin, reaching, to, her, knees, and, buttoned, all, the, way, down, a, very, short, black, skirt, and, men, s, shoes, a, very, large, bow, of, black, ribbons, instead, of, a, cravat, and, a, belt, drawn, tightly, under, her, stomach, revealing, its, rotundity, all, too, well, in, her, autobiography, 1681, christina, is, flirting, with, her, androgynous, personality, the, question, of, her, sexuality, has, been, debated, even, as, a, number, of, modern, biographers, generally, consider, her, to, have, been, a, lesbian, and, her, relationships, with, women, were, noted, during, her, lifetime, christina, seems, to, have, written, passionate, letters, to, ebba, sparre, and, guilliet, suggested, a, relationship, between, christina, and, gabrielle, de, rochechouart, de, mortemart, rachel, a, niece, of, diego, teixeira, and, the, singer, angelina, giorgino, some, historians, assert, she, maintained, heterosexual, non, sexual, lesbian, or, bisexual, relationships, during, the, course, of, her, life, depending, on, which, source, is, consulted, according, to, veronica, buckley, christina, was, a, dabbler, who, was, painted, a, lesbian, a, prostitute, a, hermaphrodite, and, an, atheist, by, her, contemporaries, though, in, that, tumultuous, age, it, is, hard, to, determine, which, was, the, most, damning, label, christina, wrote, near, the, end, of, her, life, that, she, was, neither, male, nor, hermaphrodite, as, some, people, in, the, world, have, pass, d, me, for, bargrave, recounted, that, christina, s, relationship, with, azzolino, was, both, familiar, intimate, and, amorous, and, that, azzolino, had, been, sent, by, the, pope, to, romania, as, punishment, for, maintaining, it, buckley, on, the, other, hand, believed, there, was, in, christina, a, curious, squeamishness, with, regard, to, sex, and, that, a, sexual, relationship, between, herself, and, azzolino, or, any, other, man, seems, unlikely, based, on, historical, accounts, of, christina, s, physicality, some, scholars, believe, that, she, may, have, been, an, intersex, individual, in, 1965, these, conflicting, accounts, led, to, an, investigation, of, christina, s, remains, physical, anthropologist, and, anatomist, carl, herman, hjortsj, who, undertook, the, investigation, explained, our, imperfect, knowledge, concerning, the, effect, of, intersex, on, the, skeletal, formation, makes, it, impossible, to, decide, which, positive, skeletal, findings, should, be, demanded, upon, which, to, base, the, diagnosis, nevertheless, hjortsj, speculated, that, christina, had, reasonably, typical, female, genitalia, because, it, is, recorded, by, her, physicians, bourdelot, and, macchiati, that, she, menstruated, hjortsj, s, osteological, analysis, of, christina, s, skeleton, led, him, to, state, that, they, were, of, a, typically, female, structure, some, of, the, symptoms, could, be, due, to, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, a, complex, multi, endocrine, disorder, including, hirsutism, male, pattern, type, hair, growth, due, to, increased, androgen, hormone, levels, and, abdominal, obesity, due, to, the, hormone, insulin, receptor, defects, buckley, suggested, that, her, low, comprehension, of, the, need, for, most, social, norms, little, desire, to, act, dress, or, do, other, social, norms, and, her, preference, to, wear, act, and, do, only, that, which, she, deemed, logically, practical, point, to, her, having, a, pervasive, developmental, disorder, such, as, autism, the, complex, character, of, christina, has, inspired, numerous, plays, books, and, operatic, works, including, in, 1636, 1637, peter, minuit, and, samuel, blommaert, negotiated, with, the, government, to, found, new, sweden, the, first, swedish, colony, in, the, new, world, in, 1638, minuit, erected, fort, christina, in, what, is, now, wilmington, delaware, the, christina, river, was, also, named, after, her, as, well, as, the, queen, village, neighborhood, in, center, city, philadelphia
