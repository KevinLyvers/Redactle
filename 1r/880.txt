different, dates, have, been, proposed, for, shankara, while, the, advaita, tradition, assigns, him, to, the, 5th, century, bce, the, scholarly, accepted, dating, places, shankara, to, be, a, scholar, from, the, first, half, of, the, 8th, century, ce, the, records, of, the, sringeri, matha, state, that, shankara, was, born, in, the, 14th, year, of, the, reign, of, vikramaditya, but, it, is,

and, others, too, have, seen, in, sankara, the, one, who, restored, the, hindu, dharma, against, the, attacks, of, the, buddhists, and, jains, and, in, the, process, helped, to, drive, buddhism, out,

was, the, most, influential, and, important, figure, in, the, history, of, hindu, intellectual, thought, this, does, not, seem, to, be, justified, by, the, historical, evidence, according, to, clark, sankara, was, relatively, unknown, during, his, life, time, and, probably, for, several, centuries, after, as, there, is, no, mention, of, him, in, buddhist, or, jain, sources, for, centuries, nor, is, he, mentioned, by, other, important, philosophers, of, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, according, to, king, and, roodurmun, until, the, 10th, century, shankara, was, overshadowed, by, his, older, contemporary, mandana, misra, the, latter, considered, to, be, the, major, representative, of, advaita, ma, ana, mi, ra, an, older, contemporary, of, shankara, was, a, mimamsa, scholar, and, a, follower, of, kumarila, but, also, wrote, a, seminal, text, on, advaita, that, has, survived, into, the, modern, era, the, brahma, siddhi, the, theory, of, error, set, forth, in, the, brahma, siddhi, became, the, normative, advaita, vedanta, theory, of, error, and, for, a, couple, of, centuries, he, was, the, most, influential, vedantin, his, student, vachaspati, mi, ra, who, is, believed, to, have, been, an, incarnation, of, shankara, to, popularize, the, advaita, view, wrote, the, bhamati, a, commentary, on, shankara, s, brahma, sutra, bhashya, and, the, brahmatattva, samiksa, a, commentary, on, mandana, mishra, s, brahma, siddhi, his, thought, was, mainly, inspired, by, mandana, mi, ra, and, harmonises, shankara, s, thought, with, that, of, mandana, mi, ra, the, bhamati, school, takes, an, ontological, approach, it, sees, the, jiva, as, the, source, of, avidya, it, sees, yogic, practice, and, contemplation, as, the, main, factor, in, the, acquirement, of, liberation, while, the, study, of, the, vedas, and, reflection, are, additional, factors, the, later, advaita, vedanta, tradition, incorporated, ma, ana, mi, ra, into, the, shankara, fold, by, identifying, him, with, sure, vara, 9th, century, believing, that, ma, ana, mi, ra, became, a, disciple, of, shankara, after, a, public, debate, which, shankara, won, according, to, satchidanandendra, sarasvati, almost, all, the, later, advaitins, were, influenced, by, mandana, misra, and, bhaskara, he, argues, that, most, of, post, shankara, advaita, vedanta, actually, deviates, from, shankara, and, that, only, his, student, suresvara, who, s, had, little, influence, represents, shankara, correctly, in, this, view, shankara, s, influential, student, padmapada, misunderstood, shankara, while, his, views, were, manitained, by, the, suresvara, school, hajime, nakamura, states, that, prior, to, shankara, views, similar, to, his, already, existed, but, did, not, occupy, a, dominant, position, within, the, vedanta, until, the, 11th, century, vedanta, itself, was, a, peripheral, school, of, thought, vedanta, became, a, major, influence, when, it, was, utilized, by, various, sects, of, hinduism, to, ground, their, doctrines, the, early, vedanta, scholars, were, from, the, upper, classes, of, society, well, educated, in, traditional, culture, they, formed, a, social, elite, sharply, distinguished, from, the, general, practitioners, and, theologians, of, hinduism, their, teachings, were, transmitted, among, a, small, number, of, selected, intellectuals, works, of, the, early, vedanta, schools, do, not, contain, references, to, vishnu, or, shiva, it, was, only, after, shankara, that, the, theologians, of, the, various, sects, of, hinduism, utilized, vedanta, philosophy, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, to, form, the, basis, of, their, doctrines, whereby, its, theoretical, influence, upon, the, whole, of, indian, society, became, final, and, definitive, examples, are, ramanuja, 11th, c, who, aligned, bhakti, the, major, force, in, the, religions, of, hinduism, with, philosophical, thought, meanwhile, rejecting, shankara, s, views, and, the, nath, tradition, in, medieval, times, advaita, vedanta, position, as, most, influential, hindu, darsana, started, to, take, shape, as, advaitins, in, the, vijayanagara, empire, competed, for, patronage, from, the, royal, court, and, tried, to, convert, others, to, their, sect, it, is, only, during, this, period, that, the, historical, fame, and, cultural, influence, of, shankara, and, advaita, vedanta, was, established, many, of, shankara, s, biographies, were, created, and, published, in, and, after, the, 14th, century, such, as, vidyaranya, s, widely, cited, ankara, vijaya, vidyaranya, also, known, as, madhava, who, was, the, 12th, jagadguru, of, the, ringeri, arada, p, tham, from, 1380, to, 1386, and, a, minister, in, the, vijayanagara, empire, inspired, the, re, creation, of, the, hindu, vijayanagara, empire, of, south, india, this, may, have, been, in, response, to, the, devastation, caused, by, the, islamic, delhi, sultanate, but, his, efforts, were, also, targeted, at, sri,

presenting, the, other, darsanas, as, partial, truths, which, converged, in, shankara, s, teachings, which, was, regarded, to, be, the, most, inclusive, system, the, vaishanava, traditions, of, dvaita, and, visishtadvaita, were, not, classified, as, vedanta, and, placed, just, above, buddhism, and, jainism, reflecting, the, threat, they, posed, for, vidyaranya, s, advaita, allegiance, bhedabheda, wasn, t, mentioned, at, all, literally, written, out, of, the, history, of, indian, philosophy, such, was, the, influence, of, the, sarvadar, anasa, graha, that, early, indologists, also,

commentary, on, brahma, sutra, a, fundamental, text, of, the, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, according, to, flood, of, the, upanishadic, commentaries, only, his, commentaries, on, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, and, the, taittiriya, upanishad, are, authentic, hacker, and, mayeda, also, accept, as, authentic, the, commentaries, on, the, chandogya, upanishad, the, aitareya, upanishad, the, kena,

questioned, other, authentic, works, of, shankara, include, commentaries, on, the, bhagavad, gita, part, of, his, prasthana, trayi, bhasya, his, vivarana, tertiary, notes, on, the, commentary, by, vedavyasa, on, yogasutras, as, well, as, those, on, apastamba, dharma, s, tras, adhyatama, patala, bhasya, are, accepted, by, scholars, as, authentic, works, of, shankara, among, the, stotra, poetic,

are, attributed, to, shankara, modern, era, indian, scholars, such, as, belvalkar, as, well, as, upadhyaya, accept, five, and, thirty, nine, works, respectively, as, authentic, shankara, s, stotras, considered, authentic, include, those, dedicated, to, krishna, vaishnavism, and, one, to, shiva, shaivism, often, considered, two, different, sects, within, hinduism, scholars, suggest, that, these, stotra, are, not, sectarian, but, essentially, advaitic, and, reach, for, a, unified, universal, view, of, vedanta, shankara, s, commentary, on, the, brahma, sutras, is, the, oldest, surviving, however, in, that, commentary, he, mentions, older, commentaries, like, those, of, dravida, bhartrprapancha, and, others, which, are, either, lost, or, yet, to, be, found, commentaries, on, nrisimha, purvatatapaniya, and, shveshvatara, upanishads, are, attributed, to, shankara, but, their, authenticity, is, highly, doubtful, similarly, commentaries, on, several, early, and, later, upanishads, attributed, to, shankara, are, rejected, by, scholars, to, be, his, works, and, are, likely, works, of, later, scholars, these, include, kaushitaki, upanishad, maitri, upanishad, kaivalya, upanishad, paramahamsa, upanishad, sakatayana, upanishad, mandala, brahmana, upanishad, maha, narayana, upanishad, gopalatapaniya, upanishad, however, in, brahmasutra, bhasya, shankara, cites, some, of, these, upanishads, as, he, develops, his, arguments, but, the, historical, notes, left, by, his, companions, and, disciples, along, with, major, differences, in, style, and, the, content, of, the, commentaries, on, later, upanishad, have, led, scholars, to, conclude, that, the, commentaries, on, later, upanishads, were, not, shankara, s, work, the, authenticity, of, shankara, being, the, author, of, vivekac, ma, i, has, been, questioned, though, it, is, so, closely, interwoven, into, the, spiritual, heritage, of, shankara, that, any, analysis, of, his, perspective, which, fails, to, consider, would, be, incomplete, according, to, grimes, modern, scholars, tend, to, reject, its, authenticity, as, a, work, by, shankara, while, traditionalists, tend, to, accept, it, nevertheless, does, grimes, argue, that, there, is, still, a, likelihood, that, a, kara, is, the, author, of, the, vivekac, ma, i, noting, that, it, differs, in, certain, respects, from, his, other, works, in, that, it, addresses, itself, to, a, different, audience, and, has, a, different, emphasis, and, purpose, the, aparokshanubhuti, and, atma, bodha, are, also, attributed, to, shankara, as, his, original, philosophical, treatises, but, this, is, doubtful, paul, hacker, has, also, expressed, some, reservations, that, the, compendium, sarva, darsana, siddhanta, sangraha, was, completely, authored, by, shankara, because, of, difference, in, style, and, thematic, inconsistencies, in, parts, similarly, gayatri, bhasya, is, doubtful, to, be, shankara, s, work, other, commentaries, that, are, highly, unlikely, to, be, shankara, s, work, include, those, on, uttaragita, siva, gita, brahma, gita, lalita, shasranama, suta, samhita, and, sandhya, bhasya, the, commentary, on, the, tantric, work, lalita, trisati, bhasya, attributed, to, shankara, is, also, unauthentic, shankara, is, widely, credited, with, commentaries, on, other, scriptural, works, such, as, the, vishnu, sahasran, ma, and, the, s, natsuj, tiya, but, both, these, are, considered, apocryphal, by, scholars, who, have, expressed, doubts, hastamalakiya, bhasya, is, also, widely, believed, in, india, to, be, shankara, s, work, and, it, is, included, in, samata, edition, of, shankara, s, works, but, some, scholars, consider, it, to, be, the, work, of, shankara, s, student, atma, shatakam, the, song, of, the, self, i,

making, it, india, s, most, important, spiritual, tradition, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, benedict, ashley, credits, adi, shankara, for, unifying, two, seemingly, disparate, philosophical, doctrines, in, hinduism, namely, atman, and, brahman, according, to, nakamura, shankara, was, not, an, original, thinker, but, systematised, the, works, of, preceding, philosophers, the, central, theme, of, shankara, s, writings, is, the, liberating, knowledge, of, the, identity, of, the, self, tman, and, brahman, moksha, is, attained, in, this, life, by, recognizing, the, identity, of, atman, and, brahman, as, mediated, by, the, mahavakyas, especially, tat, tvam, asi, that, you, are, shankara, lived, in, the, time, of, the, great, late, classical, hinduism, which, lasted, from, 650, till, 1100, ce, this, era, was, one, of, political, instability, that, followed, the, gupta, dynasty, and, king, harsha, of, the, 7th, century, ce, power, became, decentralised, in, india, several, larger, kingdoms, emerged, with, countless, vasal, states, the, kingdoms, were, ruled, via, a, feudal, system, smaller, kingdoms, were, dependent, on, the, protection, of, the, larger, kingdoms, the, great, king, was, remote, was, exalted, and, deified, as, reflected, in, the, tantric, mandala, which, could, also, depict, the, king, as, the, centre, of, the, mandala, the, disintegration, of, central, power, also, lead, to, regionalisation, of, religiosity, and, religious, rivalry, local, cults, and, languages, were, enhanced, and, the, influence, of, brahmanic, ritualistic, hinduism, was, diminished, rural, and, devotional, movements, arose, along, with, shaivism, vaisnavism, bhakti, and, tantra, though, sectarian, groupings, were, only, at, the, beginning, of, their, development, religious, movements, had, to, compete, for, recognition, by, the, local, lords, and, buddhism, jainism, islam, and, various, traditions, within, hinduism, were, competing, for, members, buddhism, in, particular, had, emerged, as, a, powerful, influence, in, india, s, spiritual, traditions, in, the, first, 700, years, of, the, 1st, millennium, ce, but, lost, its, position, after, the, 8th, century, and, began, to, disappear, in, india, this, was, reflected, in, the, change, of, puja, ceremonies, at, the, courts, in, the, 8th, century, where, hindu, gods, replaced, the, buddha, as, the, supreme, imperial, deity, according, to, nakamura, comparison, of, the, known, teachings, of, the, early, vedantins, and, shankara, s, thought, shows, that, most, of, the, characteristics, of, shankara, s, thought, were, advocated, by, someone, before, ankara, shankara, was, the, person, who, synthesized, the, advaita, v, da, which, had, previously, existed, before, him, according, to, nakamura, after, the, growing, influence, of, buddhism, on, ved, nta, culminating, in, the, works, of, gau, ap, da, adi, shankara, gave, a, vedantic, character, to, the, buddhistic, elements, in, these, works, synthesising, and, rejuvenating, the, doctrine, of, advaita, according, to, koller, using, ideas, in, ancient, indian, texts, shankara, systematized, the, foundation, for, advaita, ved, nta, in, the, 8th, century, reforming, badarayana, s, ved, nta, tradition, according, to, mayeda, shankara, represents, a, turning, point, in, the, development, of, ved, nta, yet, he, also, notices, that, it, is, only, since, deussens, s, praise, that, shankara, has, usually, been, regarded, as, the, greatest, philosopher, of, india, mayeda, further, notes, that, shankara, was, primarily, concerned, with, moksha, and, not, with, the, establishment, of, a, complete, system, of, philosophy, or, theology, following, potter, who, qualifies, shankara, as, a, speculative, philosopher, lipner, notes, that, shankara, s, main, literary, approach, was, commentarial, and, hence, perforce, disjointed, rather, than, procedurally, systematic, though, a, systematic, philosophy, can, be, derived, from, samkara, s, thought, shankara, has, been, described, as, influenced, by, shaivism, and, shaktism, but, his, works, and, philosophy, suggest, greater, overlap, with, vaishnavism, influence, of, yoga, school, of, hinduism, but, most, distinctly, express, his, advaitin, convictions, with, a, monistic, view, of, spirituality, and, his, commentaries, mark, a, turn, from, realism, to, idealism, the, central, theme, of, shankara, s, writings, is, the, liberating, knowledge, of, the, true, identity, of, jivatman, individual, self, as, tman, brahman, one, of, shankara, s, main, concerns, was, establishing, the, upanishads, as, an, independent, means, of, knowledge, beyond, the, ritually, oriented, m, m, s, exegesis, of, the, vedas, according, to, shankara, the, one, unchanging, entity, brahman, alone, is, real, while, changing, entities, do, not, have, absolute, existence, shankara, s, primary, objective, was, to, explain, how, moksha, is, attained, in, this, life, by, recognizing, the, true, identity, of, jivatman, as, atman, brahman, as, mediated, by, the, mah, v, kyas, especially, tat, tvam, asi, that, you, are, correct, knowledge, of, jivatman, and, atman, brahman, is, the, attainment, of, brahman, immortality, and, leads, to, moksha, liberation, from, suffering, and, samsara, the, cycle, of, rebirth, this, is, stated, by, shankara, as, follows, i, am, other, than, name, form, and, action, my, nature, is, ever, free, i, am, self, the, supreme, unconditioned, brahman, i, am, pure, awareness, always, non, dual, shankara, recognized, the, means, of, knowledge, but, his, thematic, focus, was, upon, metaphysics, and, soteriology, and, he, took, for, granted, the, pramanas, that, is, epistemology, or, means, to, gain, knowledge, reasoning, methods, that, empower, one, to, gain, reliable, knowledge, according, to, sengaku, mayeda, in, no, place, in, his, works, does, he, give, any, systematic, account, of, them, taking, atman, brahman, to, be, self, evident, svapramanaka, and, self, established, svatahsiddha, and, an, investigation, of, the, means, of, knowledge, is, of, no, use, for, the, attainment, of, final, release, mayeda, notes, that, shankara, s, arguments, are, strikingly, realistic, and, not, idealistic, arguing, that, jnana, is, based, on, existing, things, vastutantra, and, not, upon, vedic, injunction, codanatantra, nor, upon, man, purusatantra, according, to, michael, comans, aka, vasudevacharya, shankara, considered, perception, and, inference, as, a, primary, most, reliable, epistemic, means, and, where, these, means, to, knowledge, help, one, gain, what, is, beneficial, and, to, avoid, what, is, harmful, there, is, no, need, for, or, wisdom, in, referring, to, the, scriptures, in, certain, matters, related, to, metaphysics, and, ethics, says, shankara, the, testimony, and, wisdom, in, scriptures, such, as, the, vedas, and, the, upanishads, become, important, merrell, wolff, states, that, shankara, accepts, vedas, and, upanishads, as, a, source, of, knowledge, as, he, develops, his, philosophical, theses, yet, he, never, rests, his, case, on, the, ancient, texts, rather, proves, each, thesis, point, by, point, using, the, pramanas, means, of, knowledge, of, reason, and, experience, hacker, and, phillips, note, that, his, insight, into, rules, of, reasoning, and, hierarchical, emphasis, on, epistemic, steps, is, doubtlessly, the, suggestion, of, shankara, in, brahma, sutra, bhasya, an, insight, that, flowers, in, the, works, of, his, companion, and, disciple, padmapada, stcherbatsky, in, 1927, criticized, shankara, for, demanding, the, use, of, logic, from, madhyamika, buddhists, while, himself, resorting, to, revelation, as, a, source, of, knowledge, sircar, in, 1933, offered, a, different, perspective, and, stated, sankara, recognizes, the, value, of, the, law, of, contrariety, and, self, alienation, from, the, standpoint, of, idealistic, logic, and, it, has, consequently, been, possible, for, him, to, integrate, appearance, with, reality, recent, scholarship, states, that, shankara, s, arguments, on, revelation, are, about, apta, vacana, sanskrit, sayings, of, the, wise, relying, on, word, testimony, of, past, or, present, reliable, experts, it, is, part, of, his, and, advaita, vedanta, s, epistemological, foundation, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, considers, such, testimony, epistemically, valid, asserting, that, a, human, being, needs, to, know, numerous, facts, and, with, the, limited, time, and, energy, available, he, can, learn, only, a, fraction, of, those, facts, and, truths, directly, shankara, considered, the, teachings, in, the, vedas, and, upanishads, as, apta, vacana, and, a, valid, source, of, knowledge, he, suggests, the, importance, of, teacher, disciple, relationship, on, combining, logic, and, revelation, to, attain, moksha, in, his, text, upadeshasahasri, anantanand, rambachan, and, others, state, that, shankara, did, not, rely, exclusively, on, vedic, statements, but, also, used, a, range, of, logical, methods, and, reasoning, methodology, and, other, pramanas, anantanand, rambachan, summarizes, the, widely, held, view, on, the, role, of, anubhava, in, shankara, s, epistemology, as, follows, before, critiquing, it, according, to, these, studies, shankara, only, accorded, a, provisional, validity, to, the, knowledge, gained, by, inquiry, into, the, words, of, the, ruti, vedas, and, did, not, see, the, latter, as, the, unique, source, pramana, of, brahmajnana, the, affirmations, of, the, ruti, it, is, argued, need, to, be, verified, and, confirmed, by, the, knowledge, gained, through, direct, experience, anubhava, and, the, authority, of, the, ruti, therefore, is, only, secondary, shankara, considered, the, purity, and, steadiness, of, mind, achieved, in, yoga, as, an, aid, to, gaining, moksha, knowledge, but, such, yogic, state, of, mind, cannot, in, itself, give, rise, to, such, knowledge, to, shankara, that, knowledge, of, brahman, springs, only, from, inquiry, into, the, teachings, of, the, upanishads, the, method, of, yoga, encouraged, in, shankara, s, teachings, notes, comans, includes, withdrawal, of, mind, from, sense, objects, as, in, patanjali, s, system, but, it, is, not, complete, thought, suppression, instead, it, is, a, meditative, exercise, of, withdrawal, from, the, particular, and, identification, with, the, universal, leading, to, contemplation, of, oneself, as, the, most, universal, namely, consciousness, describing, shankara, s, style, of, yogic, practice, comans, writes, the, type, of, yoga, which, sankara, presents, here, is, a, method, of, merging, as, it, were, the, particular, visesa, into, the, general, samanya, for, example, diverse, sounds, are, merged, in, the, sense, of, hearing, which, has, greater, generality, insofar, as, the, sense, of, hearing, is, the, locus, of, all, sounds, the, sense, of, hearing, is, merged, into, the, mind, whose, nature, consists, of, thinking, about, things, and, the, mind, is, in, turn, merged, into, the, intellect, which, sankara, then, says, is, made, into, mere, cognition, vijnanamatra, that, is, all, particular, cognitions, resolve, into, their, universal, which, is, cognition, as, such, thought, without, any, particular, object, and, that, in, turn, is, merged, into, its, universal, mere, consciousness, prajnafnaghana, upon, which, everything, previously, referred, to, ultimately, depends, shankara, rejected, those, yoga, system, variations, that, suggest, complete, thought, suppression, leads, to, liberation, as, well, the, view, that, the, shrutis, teach, liberation, as, something, apart, from, the, knowledge, of, the, oneness, of, the, self, knowledge, alone, and, insights, relating, to, true, nature, of, things, taught, shankara, is, what, liberates, he, placed, great, emphasis, on, the, study, of, the, upanisads, emphasizing, them, as, necessary, and, sufficient, means, to, gain, self, liberating, knowledge, sankara, also, emphasized, the, need, for, and, the, role, of, guru, acharya, teacher, for, such, knowledge, shankara, cautioned, against, cherrypicking, a, phrase, or, verse, out, of, context, from, vedic, literature, and, remarks, in, the, opening, chapter, of, his, brahmasutra, bhasya, that, the, anvaya, theme, or, purport, of, any, treatise, can, only, be, correctly, understood, if, one, attends, to, the, samanvayat, tatparya, linga, that, is, six, characteristics, of, the, text, under, consideration, 1, the, common, in, upakrama, introductory, statement, and, upasamhara, conclusions, 2, abhyasa, message, repeated, 3, apurvata, unique, proposition, or, novelty, 4, phala, fruit, or, result, derived, 5, arthavada, explained, meaning, praised, point, and, 6, yukti, verifiable, reasoning, while, this, methodology, has, roots, in, the, theoretical, works, of, nyaya, school, of, hinduism, shankara, consolidated, and, applied, it, with, his, unique, exegetical, method, called, anvaya, vyatireka, which, states, that, for, proper, understanding, one, must, accept, only, meanings, that, are, compatible, with, all, characteristics, and, exclude, meanings, that, are, incompatible, with, any, moksha, liberation, from, suffering, and, rebirth, and, attaining, immortality, is, attained, by, disidentification, from, the, body, mind, complex, and, gaining, self, knowledge, as, being, in, essence, atman, and, attaining, knowledge, of, the, identity, of, tman, and, brahman, according, to, shankara, the, individual, tman, and, brahman, seem, different, at, the, empirical, level, of, reality, but, this, difference, is, only, an, illusion, and, at, the, highest, level, of, reality, they, are, really, identical, the, real, self, is, sat, the, existent, that, is, tman, brahman, whereas, the, difference, between, tman, and, non, tman, is, deemed, self, evident, knowledge, of, the, identity, of, tman, and, brahman, is, revealed, by, the, shruti, especially, the, upanishadic, statement, tat, tvam, asi, according, to, shankara, a, large, number, of, upanishadic, statements, reveal, the, identity, of, tman, and, brahman, in, the, advaita, ved, nta, tradition, four, of, those, statements, the, mah, v, kyas, which, are, taken, literal, in, contrast, to, other, statements, have, a, special, importance, in, revealing, this, identity, they, are, the, longest, chapter, of, shankara, s, upadesasahasri, chapter, 18, that, art, thou, is, devoted, to, considerations, on, the, insight, i, am, ever, free, the, existent, sat, and, the, identity, expressed, in, chandogya, upanishad, 6, 8, 7, in, the, mahavakya, great, sentence, tat, tvam, asi, that, thou, art, in, this, statement, according, to, shankara, tat, refers, to, sat, the, existent, existence, being, or, brahman, the, real, the, root, of, the, world, the, true, essence, or, root, or, origin, of, everything, that, exists, tvam, refers, to, one, s, real, i, pratyagatman, or, inner, self, the, direct, witness, within, everything, free, from, caste, family, and, purifying, ceremonies, the, essence, atman, which, the, individual, at, the, core, is, as, shankara, states, in, the, upadesasahasri, up, i, 174, through, such, sentences, as, thou, art, that, one, knows, one, s, own, atman, the, witness, of, all, the, internal, organs, up, i, 18, 190, through, such, sentences, as, the, existent, right, knowledge, concerning, the, inner, atman, will, become, clearer, up, i, 18, 193, 194, in, the, sentence, thou, art, that, he, word, that, means, inner, atman, the, statement, tat, tvam, asi, sheds, the, false, notion, that, atman, is, different, from, brahman, according, tonakamura, the, non, duality, of, atman, and, brahman, is, a, famous, characteristic, of, sankara, s, thought, but, it, was, already, taught, by, sundarapandya, c, 600, ce, or, earlier, shankara, cites, sundarapandya, in, his, comments, to, brahma, sutra, verse, i, 1, 4, when, the, metaphorical, or, false, atman, is, non, existent, child, body, are, sublated, therefore, when, it, is, realized, that, i, am, the, existent, brahman, atman, how, can, anyduty, exist, from, this, and, a, large, number, of, other, accordances, nakamura, concludes, that, shankar, was, not, an, original, thinker, but, a, synthesizer, of, existing, advaita, and, the, rejuvenator, as, well, as, a, defender, of, ancient, learning, in, the, upadesasahasri, shankara, shankara, is, ambivalent, on, the, need, for, meditation, on, the, upanishadic, mahavyaka, he, states, that, right, knowledge, arises, at, the, moment, of, hearing, and, rejects, prasamcaksa, or, prasamkhyana, meditation, that, is, meditation, on, the, meaning, of, the, sentences, and, in, up, ii, 3, recommends, parisamkhyana, separating, atman, from, everything, that, is, not, atman, that, is, the, sense, objects, and, sense, organs, and, the, pleasant, and, unpleasant, things, and, merit, and, demerit, connected, with, them, yet, shankara, then, concludes, with, declaring, that, only, atman, exists, stating, that, all, the, sentences, of, the, upanishads, concerning, non, duality, of, atman, should, be, fully, contemplated, should, be, contemplated, as, mayeda, states, how, they, differ, from, each, other, in, not, known, prasamkhyana, was, advocated, by, mandana, misra, the, older, contemporary, of, shankara, who, was, the, most, influential, advaitin, until, the, 10th, century, according, to, mandana, the, mahavakyas, are, incapable, by, themselves, of, bringing, about, brahmajnana, the, vedanta, vakyas, convey, an, indirect, knowledge, which, is, made, direct, only, by, deep, meditation, prasamkhyana, the, latter, is, a, continuous, contemplation, of, the, purport, of, the, mahavakyas, v, caspati, mi, ra, a, student, of, mandana, misra, agreed, with, mandana, misra, and, their, stance, is, defended, by, the, bhamati, school, founded, by, v, caspati, mi, ra, in, contrast, the, vivarana, school, founded, by, prakasatman, c, 1200, 1300, follows, shankara, closely, arguing, that, the, mahavakyas, are, the, direct, cause, of, gaining, knowledge, shankara, in, his, text, upadesasahasri, discourages, ritual, worship, such, as, oblations, to, deva, god, because, that, assumes, the, self, within, is, different, from, the, brahman, the, doctrine, of, difference, is, wrong, asserts, shankara, because, he, who, knows, the, brahman, is, one, and, he, is, another, does, not, know, brahman, the, false, notion, that, atman, is, different, from, brahman, is, connected, with, the, novice, s, conviction, that, upadeshasahasri, ii, 1, 25, i, am, one, he, is, another, i, am, ignorant, experience, pleasure, and, pain, am, bound, and, a, transmigrator, he, is, essentially, different, from, me, the, god, not, subject, to, transmigration, by, worshipping, him, with, oblation, offerings, homage, and, the, like, through, the, the, actions, prescribed, for, class, and, stage, of, life, i, wish, to, get, out, of, the, ocean, of, transmigratory, existence, how, am, i, he, recognizing, oneself, as, the, existent, brahman, which, is, mediated, by, scriptural, teachings, is, contrasted, with, the, notion, of, i, act, which, is, mediated, by, relying, on, sense, perception, and, the, like, according, to, shankara, the, statement, thou, art, that, remove, the, delusion, of, a, hearer, so, through, sentences, as, thou, art, that, one, knows, one, s, own, atman, the, witness, of, all, internal, organs, and, not, from, any, actions, with, this, realization, the, performance, of, rituals, is, prohibited, since, rituals, and, their, requisites, is, contradictory, to, the, realization, of, the, identity, with, the, highest, atman, however, shankara, also, asserts, that, self, knowledge, is, realized, when, one, s, mind, is, purified, by, an, ethical, life, that, observes, yamas, such, as, ahimsa, non, injury, non, violence, to, others, in, body, mind, and, thoughts, and, niyamas, rituals, and, rites, such, as, yajna, a, fire, ritual, asserts, shankara, can, help, draw, and, prepare, the, mind, for, the, journey, to, self, knowledge, he, emphasizes, the, need, for, ethics, such, as, akrodha, and, yamas, during, brahmacharya, stating, the, lack, of, ethics, as, causes, that, prevent, students, from, attaining, knowledge, shankara, while, rejecting, empirical, reality, due, to, his, position, of, nonduality, still, attributes, value, to, the, universe, as, it, identifies, with, vara, he, sometimes, blurs, the, distinction, between, vara, and, brahman, using, various, terms, for, both, however, he, generally, separates, vara, associated, with, the, universe, and, its, attributes, from, the, absolute, nondual, brahman, drawing, from, the, upanishads, shankara, sees, vara, as, the, universe, s, material, and, intelligent, cause, emanating, it, through, the, power, of, maya, thereby, making, the, universe, sentient, and, self, aware, in, relation, to, the, mandukya, upanishad, shankara, compares, the, universe, s, unmanifest, state, to, vara, in, a, deep, dreamless, cosmic, state, shankara, s, vedanta, shows, similarities, with, mahayana, buddhism, opponents, have, even, accused, shankara, of, being, a, crypto, buddhist, a, qualification, which, is, rejected, by, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, given, the, differences, between, these, two, schools, according, to, shankara, a, major, difference, between, advaita, and, mahayana, buddhism, are, their, views, on, atman, and, brahman, according, to, both, loy, and, jayatilleke, more, differences, can, be, discerned, despite, shankara, s, criticism, of, certain, schools, of, mahayana, buddhism, shankara, s, philosophy, shows, strong, similarities, with, the, mahayana, buddhist, philosophy, which, he, attacks, according, to, s, n, dasgupta, shankara, and, his, followers, borrowed, much, of, their, dialectic, form, of, criticism, from, the, buddhists, his, brahman, was, very, much, like, the, sunya, of, nagarjuna, the, debts, of, shankara, to, the, self, luminosity, of, the, vijnanavada, buddhism, can, hardly, be, overestimated, there, seems, to, be, much, truth, in, the, accusations, against, shankara, by, vijnana, bhiksu, and, others, that, he, was, a, hidden, buddhist, himself, i, am, led, to, think, that, shankara, s, philosophy, is, largely, a, compound, of, vijnanavada, and, sunyavada, buddhism, with, the, upanisad, notion, of, the, permanence, of, self, superadded, according, to, mudgal, shankara, s, advaita, and, the, buddhist, madhyamaka, view, of, ultimate, reality, are, compatible, because, they, are, both, transcendental, indescribable, non, dual, and, only, arrived, at, through, a, via, negativa, neti, neti, mudgal, concludes, therefore, that, the, difference, between, sunyavada, mahayana, philosophy, of, buddhism, and, advaita, philosophy, of, hinduism, may, be, a, matter, of, emphasis, not, of, kind, some, hindu, scholars, criticized, advaita, for, its, maya, and, non, theistic, doctrinal, similarities, with, buddhism, ramanuja, the, founder, of, vishishtadvaita, ved, nta, accused, adi, shankara, of, being, a, prachanna, bauddha, that, is, a, crypto, buddhist, and, someone, who, was, undermining, theistic, bhakti, devotionalism, the, non, advaita, scholar, bhaskara, of, the, bhedabheda, ved, nta, tradition, similarly, around, 800, ce, accused, shankara, s, advaita, as, this, despicable, broken, down, mayavada, that, has, been, chanted, by, the, mahayana, buddhists, and, a, school, that, is, undermining, the, ritual, duties, set, in, vedic, orthodoxy, the, qualification, of, crypto, buddhist, is, rejected, by, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, highlighting, their, respective, views, on, atman, anatta, and, brahman, there, are, differences, in, the, conceptual, means, of, liberation, nirvana, a, term, more, often, used, in, buddhism, is, the, liberating, blowing, out, of, craving, aided, by, the, realization, and, acceptance, that, there, is, no, self, anatman, as, the, center, of, perception, craving, and, delusion, moksha, a, term, more, common, in, hinduism, is, the, similar, liberating, release, from, craving, and, ignorance, yet, aided, by, the, realization, and, acceptance, that, one, s, inner, self, is, not, a, personal, ego, self, but, a, universal, self
