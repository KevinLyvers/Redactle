during, the, course, of, an, interview, for, the, new, yorker, i, told, the, interviewer, mark, singer, that, i, believed, stories, are, found, things, like, fossils, in, the, ground, he, said, that, he, didn, t, believe, me, i, replied, that, that, was, fine, as, long, as, he, believed, that, i, believe, it, and, i, do, stories, aren, t, souvenir, tee, shirts, or, gameboys, stories, are, relics, part, of, an, undiscovered, pre, existing, world, the, writer, s, job, is, to, use, the, tools, in, his, or, her, toolbox, to, get, as, much, of, each, one, out, of, the, ground, intact, as, possible, sometimes, the, fossil, you, uncover, is, small, a, seashell, sometimes, it, s, enormous, a, tyrannosaurus, rex, with, all, those, gigantic, ribs, and, grinning, teeth, either, way, short, story, or, thousand, page, whopper, of, a, novel, the, techniques, of, excavation, remain, basically, the, same, king, often, starts, with, a, what, if, scenario, asking, what, would, happen, if, an, alcoholic, writer, was, stranded, with, his, family, in, a, haunted, hotel, the, shining, or, if, one, could, see, the, outcome, of, future, events, the, dead, zone, or, if, one, could, travel, in, time, to, alter, the, course, of, history, 11, 22, 63, he, writes, that, the, situation, comes, first, the, characters, always, flat, and, unfeatured, to, begin, with, come, next, once, these, things, are, fixed, in, my, mind, i, begin, to, narrate, i, often, have, an, idea, of, what, the, outcome, may, be, but, i, have, never, demanded, a, set, of, characters, that, they, do, things, my, way, on, the, contrary, i, want, them, to, do, things, their, way, in, some, instances, the, outcome, is, what, i, visualized, in, most, however, it, s, something, i, never, expected, joyce, carol, oates, called, king, both, a, storyteller, and, an, inventor, of, startling, images, and, metaphors, which, linger, long, in, the, memory, an, example, of, king, s, imagery, is, seen, in, the, body, when, the, narrator, recalls, a, childhood, clubhouse, with, a, tin, roof, and, rusty, screen, door, no, matter, what, time, of, day, you, looked, out, that, screen, door, it, looked, like, sunset, when, it, rained, being, inside, the, club, was, like, being, inside, a, jamaican, steel, drum, king, writes, that, the, use, of, simile, and, other, figurative, language, is, one, of, the, chief, delights, of, fiction, reading, it, and, writing, it, as, well, by, comparing, two, seemingly, unrelated, objects, a, restaurant, bar, and, a, cave, a, mirror, and, a, mirage, we, are, sometimes, able, to, see, an, old, thing, in, a, new, and, vivid, way, even, if, the, result, is, mere, clarity, instead, of, beauty, i, think, writer, and, reader, are, participating, together, in, a, kind, of, miracle, maybe, that, s, drawing, it, a, little, strong, but, yeah, it, s, what, i, believe, when, asked, if, fear, was, his, main, subject, king, said, in, every, life, you, get, to, a, point, where, you, have, to, deal, with, something, that, s, inexplicable, to, you, whether, it, s, the, doctor, saying, you, have, cancer, or, a, prank, phone, call, so, whether, you, talk, about, ghosts, or, vampires, or, nazi, war, criminals, living, down, the, block, we, re, still, talking, about, the, same, thing, which, is, an, intrusion, of, the, extraordinary, into, ordinary, life, and, how, we, deal, with, it, what, that, shows, about, our, character, and, our, interactions, with, others, and, the, society, we, live, in, interests, me, a, lot, more, than, monsters, and, vampires, and, ghouls, and, ghosts, joyce, carol, oates, said, that, stephen, king, s, characteristic, subject, is, small, town, american, life, often, set, in, fictitious, derry, maine, tales, of, family, life, marital, life, the, lives, of, children, banded, together, by, age, circumstance, and, urgency, where, parents, prove, oblivious, or, helpless, the, human, heart, in, conflict, with, itself, in, the, guise, of, the, malevolent, other, the, gothic, imagination, magnifies, the, vicissitudes, of, real, life, in, order, to, bring, it, into, a, sharper, and, clearer, focus, king, s, the, body, is, about, coming, of, age, a, theme, he, has, returned, to, several, times, for, example, in, joyland, king, often, uses, authors, as, characters, such, as, ben, mears, in, salem, s, lot, jack, torrance, in, the, shining, adult, bill, denbrough, in, it, and, mike, noonan, in, bag, of, bones, he, has, extended, this, to, breaking, the, fourth, wall, by, including, himself, as, a, character, in, three, novels, of, the, dark, tower, among, other, things, this, allows, king, to, explore, themes, of, authorship, george, stade, writes, that, misery, is, a, parable, in, chiller, form, of, the, popular, writer, s, relation, to, his, audience, which, holds, him, prisoner, and, dictates, what, he, writes, on, pain, of, death, while, the, dark, half, is, a, parable, in, chiller, form, of, the, popular, writer, s, relation, to, his, creative, genius, the, vampire, within, him, the, part, of, him, that, only, awakes, to, raise, cain, when, he, writes, introducing, king, at, the, national, book, awards, walter, mosley, said, stephen, king, once, said, that, daily, life, is, the, frame, that, makes, the, picture, his, commitment, as, i, see, it, is, to, celebrate, and, empower, the, everyday, man, and, woman, as, they, buy, aspirin, and, cope, with, cancer, he, takes, our, daily, lives, and, makes, them, into, something, heroic, he, takes, our, world, validates, our, distrust, of, it, and, then, helps, us, to, see, that, there, s, a, chance, to, transcend, the, muck, he, tells, us, that, even, if, we, fail, in, our, struggles, we, are, still, worthy, enough, to, pass, on, our, energies, in, the, survival, of, humanity, in, his, speech, accepting, the, medal, for, distinguished, contribution, to, american, letters, king, said, frank, norris, the, author, of, mcteague, said, something, like, this, what, should, i, care, if, they, i, e, the, critics, single, me, out, for, sneers, and, laughter, i, never, truckled, i, never, lied, i, told, the, truth, and, that, s, always, been, the, bottom, line, for, me, the, story, and, the, people, in, it, may, be, make, believe, but, i, need, to, ask, myself, over, and, over, if, i, ve, told, the, truth, about, the, way, real, people, would, behave, in, a, similar, situation, we, understand, that, fiction, is, a, lie, to, begin, with, to, ignore, the, truth, inside, the, lie, is, to, sin, against, the, craft, in, general, and, one, s, own, work, in, particular, in, on, writing, king, says, if, you, want, to, be, a, writer, you, must, do, two, things, above, all, read, a, lot, and, write, a, lot, he, emphasizes, the, importance, of, good, description, which, begins, with, clear, seeing, and, ends, with, clear, writing, the, kind, of, writing, that, employs, fresh, images, and, simple, vocabulary, i, began, learning, my, lessons, in, this, regard, by, reading, chandler, hammett, and, ross, macdonald, i, gained, perhaps, even, more, respect, for, the, power, of, compact, descriptive, language, from, reading, t, s, eliot, those, ragged, claws, scuttling, across, the, ocean, floor, those, coffee, spoons, and, william, carlos, williams, white, chickens, red, wheelbarrow, the, plums, that, were, in, the, ice, box, so, sweet, and, so, cold, king, has, called, richard, matheson, the, author, who, influenced, me, most, other, influences, include, ray, bradbury, joseph, payne, brennan, james, m, cain, jack, finney, graham, greene, elmore, leonard, john, d, macdonald, don, robertson, and, thomas, williams, he, often, pays, homage, to, classic, horror, stories, by, retelling, them, in, a, modern, context, he, recalls, that, while, writing, salem, s, lot, i, decided, i, wanted, to, try, to, use, the, book, partially, as, a, form, of, literary, homage, as, peter, straub, had, done, in, ghost, story, working, in, the, tradition, of, such, classical, ghost, story, writers, as, henry, james, m, r, james, and, nathaniel, hawthorne, so, my, novel, bears, an, intentional, similarity, to, bram, stoker, s, dracula, and, after, a, while, it, began, to, seem, i, was, playing, an, interesting, to, me, at, least, game, of, literary, racquet, ball, salem, s, lot, itself, was, the, ball, and, dracula, was, the, wall, i, kept, hitting, it, against, watching, to, see, how, and, where, it, could, bounce, so, i, could, hit, it, again, as, a, matter, of, fact, it, took, some, pretty, interesting, bounces, and, i, ascribe, this, mostly, to, the, fact, that, while, my, ball, existed, in, the, twentieth, century, the, wall, was, very, much, a, product, of, the, nineteenth, similarly, king, s, revival, is, a, modern, riff, on, mary, shelley, s, frankenstein, king, dedicated, it, to, the, people, who, built, my, house, shelley, stoker, h, p, lovecraft, clark, ashton, smith, donald, wandrei, fritz, leiber, august, derleth, shirley, jackson, robert, bloch, straub, and, arthur, machen, whose, short, novel, the, great, god, pan, has, haunted, me, all, my, life, in, j, peder, zane, s, the, top, ten, authors, pick, their, favorite, books, king, chose, the, golden, argosy, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, the, satanic, verses, mcteague, lord, of, the, flies, bleak, house, nineteen, eighty, four, the, raj, quartet, light, in, august, and, blood, meridian, he, provided, an, appreciation, for, the, golden, argosy, a, collection, of, short, stories, featuring, cather, hemingway, faulkner, fitzgerald, and, others, i, first, found, the, golden, argosy, in, a, lisbon, falls, maine, bargain, barn, called, the, jolly, white, elephant, where, it, was, on, offer, for, 2, 25, at, that, time, i, only, had, four, dollars, and, spending, over, half, of, it, on, one, book, even, a, hardcover, was, a, tough, decision, i, ve, never, regretted, it, the, golden, argosy, taught, me, more, about, good, writing, than, all, the, writing, classes, i, ve, ever, taken, it, was, the, best, 2, 25, i, ever, spent, in, 2022, he, provided, another, list, of, ten, favorite, books, lord, of, the, flies, nineteen, eighty, four, and, blood, meridian, remained, and, he, added, ship, of, fools, the, orphan, master, s, son, invisible, man, watership, down, the, hair, of, harold, roux, american, pastoral, and, the, lord, of, the, rings, he, added, although, anthony, powell, s, novels, should, probably, be, on, here, especially, the, sublimely, titled, casanova, s, chinese, restaurant, and, books, do, furnish, a, room, and, paul, scott, s, raj, quartet, and, at, least, six, novels, by, patricia, highsmith, and, what, about, patrick, o, brian, see, how, hard, this, is, to, do, king, has, been, praised, for, his, use, of, realistic, detail, in, a, century, of, great, suspense, stories, editor, jeffery, deaver, wrote, that, while, there, were, many, good, best, selling, writers, before, him, king, more, than, anybody, since, john, d, macdonald, brought, reality, to, genre, novels, he, has, often, remarked, that, salem, s, lot, was, peyton, place, meets, dracula, and, so, it, was, the, rich, characterization, the, careful, and, caring, social, eye, the, interplay, of, story, line, and, character, development, announced, that, writers, could, take, worn, themes, such, as, vampirism, and, make, them, fresh, again, before, king, many, popular, writers, found, their, efforts, to, make, their, books, serious, blue, penciled, by, their, editors, stuff, like, that, gets, in, the, way, of, the, story, they, were, told, well, it, s, stuff, like, that, that, has, made, king, so, popular, and, helped, free, the, popular, name, from, the, shackles, of, simple, genre, writing, he, is, a, master, of, masters, daniel, mendelsohn, reviewing, bag, of, bones, wrote, that, stephen, king, is, so, widely, accepted, as, america, s, master, of, paranormal, terrors, that, you, can, forget, his, real, genius, is, for, the, everyday, this, is, a, book, about, reanimation, the, ghosts, of, course, but, also, mike, s, his, desire, to, re, embrace, love, and, work, after, a, long, bereavement, that, king, depicts, with, an, eye, for, the, kind, of, small, but, moving, details, that, don, t, typically, distinguish, blockbuster, horror, novels, many, critics, argue, that, king, has, matured, as, a, writer, in, his, analysis, of, post, world, war, ii, horror, fiction, the, modern, weird, tale, 2001, s, t, joshi, devotes, a, chapter, to, king, s, work, joshi, argues, that, king, s, best, known, works, are, his, worst, describing, them, as, mostly, bloated, illogical, maudlin, and, prone, to, deus, ex, machina, endings, despite, these, criticisms, joshi, argues, that, since, gerald, s, game, 1992, king, has, been, tempering, the, worst, of, his, writing, faults, producing, books, that, are, leaner, more, believable, and, generally, better, written, in, 2003, king, was, honored, by, the, national, book, awards, with, a, lifetime, achievement, award, the, medal, of, distinguished, contribution, to, american, letters, some, in, the, literary, community, expressed, disapproval, of, the, award, richard, e, snyder, the, former, ceo, of, simon, schuster, described, king, s, work, as, non, literature, and, critic, harold, bloom, denounced, the, choice, the, decision, to, give, the, national, book, foundation, s, annual, award, for, distinguished, contribution, to, stephen, king, is, extraordinary, another, low, in, the, shocking, process, of, dumbing, down, our, cultural, life, i, ve, described, king, in, the, past, as, a, writer, of, penny, dreadfuls, but, perhaps, even, that, is, too, kind, he, shares, nothing, with, edgar, allan, poe, what, he, is, is, an, immensely, inadequate, writer, on, a, sentence, by, sentence, paragraph, by, paragraph, book, by, book, basis, king, acknowledged, the, controversy, in, his, acceptance, speech, there, are, some, people, who, have, spoken, out, passionately, about, giving, me, this, medal, there, are, some, people, who, think, it, s, an, extraordinarily, bad, idea, there, have, been, some, people, who, have, spoken, out, who, think, it, s, an, extraordinarily, good, idea, you, know, who, you, are, and, where, you, stand, and, most, of, you, who, are, here, tonight, are, on, my, side, i, m, glad, for, that, but, i, want, to, say, it, doesn, t, matter, in, a, sense, which, side, you, were, on, the, people, who, speak, out, speak, out, because, they, are, passionate, about, the, book, about, the, word, about, the, page, and, in, that, sense, we, re, all, brothers, and, sisters, give, yourself, a, hand, shirley, hazzard, whose, novel, the, great, fire, was, that, year, s, national, book, award, winner, responded, by, criticising, king, she, later, said, that, she, had, never, read, him, roger, ebert, wrote, that, a, lot, people, were, outraged, when, he, was, honored, at, the, national, book, awards, as, if, a, popular, writer, couldn, t, be, taken, seriously, but, after, finding, that, his, book, on, writing, has, more, useful, and, observant, things, to, say, about, the, craft, than, any, book, since, strunk, and, white, s, the, elements, of, style, i, have, gotten, over, my, own, snobbery, king, has, after, all, been, responsible, for, the, movies, the, shawshank, redemption, the, green, mile, the, dead, zone, misery, apt, pupil, christine, hearts, in, atlantis, stand, by, me, and, carrie, and, we, must, not, be, ungrateful, for, silver, bullet, which, i, awarded, three, stars, because, it, was, either, the, worst, movie, made, from, a, stephen, king, story, or, the, funniest, and, you, know, which, side, of, that, i, m, gonna, come, down, on, cynthia, ozick, said, that, upon, giving, a, reading, with, king, it, dawned, on, me, as, i, listened, to, him, that, never, mind, all, the, best, sellers, and, all, the, stereotypes, this, man, is, a, genuine, true, born, writer, and, that, was, a, revelation, he, is, not, tom, clancy, he, writes, sentences, and, he, has, a, literary, focus, and, his, writing, is, filled, with, literary, history, it, s, not, glib, it, s, not, just, contemporary, chatter, and, it, s, not, stupid, that, s, a, bad, way, to, say, that, something, s, smart, but, that, s, what, i, mean, joyce, carol, oates, praised, king, s, sense, of, place, his, fiction, is, famously, saturated, with, the, atmosphere, of, maine, much, of, his, mostly, vividly, imagined, work, salem, s, lot, dolores, claiborne, the, elegantly, composed, story, the, reach, for, instance, is, a, poetic, evocation, of, that, landscape, its, history, and, its, inhabitants, oates, included, the, latter, story, in, the, second, edition, of, the, oxford, book, of, american, short, stories, peter, straub, compared, king, favorably, to, charles, dickens, both, are, novelists, of, vast, popularity, and, enormous, bibliographies, both, are, beloved, writers, with, a, pronounced, taste, for, the, morbid, and, grotesque, both, display, a, deep, interest, in, the, underclass, straub, included, king, s, short, story, that, feeling, you, can, only, say, what, it, is, in, french, in, the, library, of, america, anthology, american, fantastic, tales, david, foster, wallace, assigned, carrie, and, the, stand, while, teaching, at, illinois, state, university, wallace, praised, king, s, ear, for, dialogue, he, s, one, of, the, first, people, to, talk, about, real, americans, and, how, they, live, to, capture, real, american, dialogue, in, all, its, like, foulmouthed, grandeur, he, has, a, deadly, ear, for, the, way, people, speak, students, come, to, me, and, a, lot, of, them, have, been, led, to, believe, that, there, s, good, stuff, and, bad, stuff, literary, books, and, popular, books, stuff, that, s, redemptive, and, commercial, shit, with, a, sharp, line, drawn, between, the, two, categories, it, s, good, to, show, them, that, there, s, a, certain, amount, of, blurring, surface, wise, king, s, work, is, a, bit, televisual, but, there, s, really, a, lot, going, on, in, an, interview, sherman, alexie, recalls, the, influence, of, stephen, king, who, was, always, writing, about, underdogs, and, bullied, kids, and, kids, fighting, back, against, overwhelming, often, supernatural, forces, the, world, aligned, against, them, as, an, indian, boy, growing, up, on, a, reservation, i, always, identified, with, his, protagonists, stephen, king, fighting, the, monsters, lauren, groff, says, that, i, love, stephen, king, and, i, owe, him, more, than, i, could, ever, express, i, love, his, wild, imagination, and, his, vivid, scenes, many, of, which, populate, my, nightmares, even, decades, after, i, last, read, the, books, they, re, in, but, the, greatest, thing, i, gleaned, most, from, reading, stephen, king, is, his, big, hearted, glee, the, way, he, treats, writing, with, gratitude, the, way, he, sees, his, job, not, as, the, source, of, anguish, and, pain, many, writers, self, pityingly, see, it, as, but, rather, as, something, he, s, over, the, moon, delighted, to, be, lucky, enough, to, do, if, i, could, steal, one, thing, from, king, and, keep, it, close, to, my, heart, forever, it, is, his, sense, of, almost, holy, glee, when, it, comes, to, writing, the, hero, of, junot, d, az, s, the, brief, wondrous, life, of, oscar, wao, dreams, of, being, the, dominican, stephen, king, and, d, az, alludes, to, king, s, work, several, times, throughout, the, novel, colson, whitehead, recalls, that, the, first, big, book, i, read, was, night, shift, by, stephen, king, you, know, a, huge, book, of, short, stories, and, so, for, many, years, i, just, wanted, to, write, horror, fiction, in, a, talk, at, virginia, commonwealth, university, whitehead, recalls, that, in, college, i, wanted, to, write, the, black, shining, or, the, black, salem, s, lot, take, any, stephen, king, title, and, put, the, black, in, front, of, it, that, s, basically, what, i, wanted, to, do, king, was, raised, methodist, but, lost, his, belief, in, organized, religion, while, in, high, school, while, not,
