disorder, and, the, prospect, of, a, rebellion, if, o, connell, were, barred, from, parliament, wellington, and, peel, now, conceded, the, necessity, of, catholic, emancipation, peel, writing, to, wellington, that, though, emancipation, was, a, great, danger, civil, strife, was, a, greater, danger, peel, drew, up, the, catholic, relief, bill, he, felt, compelled, to, stand, for, re, election, to, his, seat, in, oxford, as, he, was, representing, the, graduates, of, oxford, university, many, of, whom, were, anglican, clergymen, and, had, previously, stood, on, a, platform, of, opposition, to, catholic, emancipation, peel, lost, his, seat, in, a, by, election, in, february, 1829, to, ultra, tory, robert, inglis, but, soon, found, another, by, moving, to, a, rotten, borough, westbury,

through, the, house, of, commons, wellington, through, the, house, of, lords, with, many, ultra, tories, vehemently, opposed, to, emancipation, the, bill, could, pass, only, with, whig, support, wellington, threatened, to, resign, if, king, george, iv, did, not, give, royal, assent, the, king, finally, relented, the, roman, catholic, relief, act, 1829, passed, into, law, in, april, 1829, peel, s, u, turn, cost, him, the, trust, of, many, tories, according, to, norman, gash, peel, had, been, the, idolized, champion, of, the, protestant, party, that, party, now, regarded, him, as, an, outcast, it, was, in, 1829, that, peel, established, the, metropolitan, police, force, for, london, based, at, scotland, yard, the, 1, 000, constables, employed, were, affectionately, nicknamed, bobbies, or, somewhat, less, affectionately, peelers, although, unpopular, at, first, they, proved, very, successful, in, cutting, crime, in, london, and, by, 1857, all, cities, in, britain, were, obliged, to, form, their, own, police, forces, known, as, the, father, of, modern, policing, peel, is, thought, to, have, contributed, to, the, metropolitan, police, s, first, set, of, instructions, to, police, officers, emphasising, the, importance, of, its, civilian, nature, and, policing, by, consent, however, what, are, now, commonly, known, as, the, peelian, principles, were, not, written, by, him, but, were, instead, produced, by, charles, reith, in, his, 1948, book, a, short, history, of, the, british, police, as, a, nine, point, summary, of, the, 1829, instructions, the, middle, and, working, classes, in, england, at, that, time, however, were, clamouring, for, reform, and, catholic, emancipation, was, only, one, of, the, ideas, in, the, air, the, tory, ministry, refused, to, bend, on, other, issues, and, were, swept, out, of, office, in, 1830, in, favour, of, the, whigs, the, following, few, years, were, extremely, turbulent, but, eventually, enough, reforms, were, passed, that, king, william, iv, felt, confident, enough, to, invite, the, tories, to, form, a, ministry, again, in, succession, to, those, of, lord, grey, and, lord, melbourne, in, december, 1834, peel, was, selected, as, prime, minister, but, was, in, italy, at, the, time, so, wellington, acted, as, a, caretaker, for, three, weeks, until, peel, s, return, following, the, resignation, of, former, prime, minister, charles, grey, because, of, an, issue, regarding, ireland, s, conciliatory, reform, and, at, the, invitation, of, king, william, iv, peel, became, prime, minister, in, early, december, 1834, peel, formed, his, own, government, though, it, was, a, tory, government, that, was, a, minority, government, and, depended, on, whig, goodwill, for, its, continued, existence, parliament, was, dissolved, in, late, december, 1834, and, a, general, election, was, called, voting, took, place, in, january, and, february, 1835, and, peel, s, supporters, gained, around, 100, seats, but, this, was, not, enough, to, give, them, a, majority, as, his, statement, of, policy, at, the, general, election, of, january, 1835, peel, issued, the, tamworth, manifesto, this, document, was, the, basis, on, which, the, modern, conservative, party, was, founded, in, it, peel, pledged, that, the, conservatives, would, endorse, modest, reform, such, as, reforms, concerning, economic, and, financial, affairs, free, trade, and, factory, workers, rights, the, whigs, formed, a, compact, with, daniel, o, connell, s, irish, radical, members, to, repeatedly, defeat, the, government, on, various, bills, eventually, after, only, about, 100, days, in, government, peel, s, ministry, resigned, out, of, frustration, and, the, whigs, under, lord, melbourne, returned, to, power, the, only, real, achievement, of, peel, s, first, administration, was, a, commission, to, review, the, governance, of, the, church, of, england, this, ecclesiastical, commission, was, the, forerunner, of, the, church, commissioners, despite, the, january, 1835, general, election, from, which, peel, attempted, to, consolidate, his, party, s, majority, in, parliament, the, conservatives, still, remained, a, minority, this, made, peel, s, position, in, the, commons, precarious, from, the, start, the, immediate, cause, of, peel, s, downfall, was, a, debate, over, the, church, of, ireland, on, 7, april, 1835, whig, mp, ralph, bernal, brought, forward, a, report, critical, of, peel, s, administration, of, the, church, of, ireland, s, revenues, and, proposed, reforms, the, report, was, passed, in, the, house, of, commons, by, a, vote, of, 285, to, 258, signifying, a, lack, of, confidence, in, peel, s, government, this, defeat, underscored, the, government, s, inability, to, secure, enough, support, to, govern, effectively, this, loss, led, to, peel, s, resignation, the, following, day, on, 8, april, 1835, the, passing, of, the, vote, of, no, confidence, highlighted, the, conditions, in, british, politics, at, the, time, in, a, parliamentary, system, after, peel, s, resignation, king, william, iv, invited, lord, melbourne, to, form, a, new, government, allowing, the, whigs, to, return, to, power, peel, s, party, was, bolstered, by, the, adherence, of, a, number, of, dissident, whigs, associated, with, the, derby, dilly, these, self, described, moderate, whigs, were, lead, by, former, cabinet, ministers, edward, smith, stanley, 14th, earl, of, derby, and, sir, james, graham, 2nd, baronet, in, may, 1839, peel, was, offered, another, chance, to, form, a, government, this, time, by, the, new, monarch, queen, victoria, however, this, too, would, have, been, a, minority, government, and, peel, felt, he, needed, a, further, sign, of, confidence, from, his, queen, lord, melbourne, had, been, victoria, s, confidant, since, her, accession, in, 1837, and, many, of, the, higher, posts, in, victoria, s, household, were, held, by, the, wives, and, female, relatives, of, whigs, there, was, some, feeling, that, victoria, had, allowed, herself, to, be, too, closely, associated, with, the, whig, party, peel, therefore, asked, that, some, of, this, entourage, be, dismissed, and, replaced, with, their, conservative, counterparts, provoking, the, so, called, bedchamber, crisis, victoria, refused, to, change, her, household, and, despite, pleadings, from, the, duke, of, wellington, relied, on, assurances, of, support, from, whig, leaders, peel, refused, to, form, a, government, and, the, whigs, returned, to, power, peel, finally, had, a, chance, to, head, a, majority, government, following, the, election, of, july, 1841, peel, came, to, office, during, an, economic, recession, which, had, seen, a, slump, in, world, trade, and, a, budget, deficit, of, 7, 5, million, run, up, by, the, whigs, confidence, in, banks, and, businesses, was, low, and, a, trade, deficit, existed, to, raise, revenue, peel, s, 1842, budget, saw, the, re, introduction, of, the, income, tax, removed, previously, at, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, rate, was, 7d, in, the, pound, or, just, under, 3, per, cent, the, money, raised, was, more, than, expected, and, allowed, for, the, removal, and, reduction, of, over, 1, 200, tariffs, on, imports, including, the, controversial, sugar, duties, it, was, also, in, the, 1842, budget, that, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, was, first, proposed, it, was, defeated, in, a, commons, vote, by, a, margin, of, 4, 1, the, economic, historian, charles, read, has, analysed, peel, s, economic, policies, as, i, fixing, the, value, of, british, currency, to, a, gold, standard, with, the, paper, pound, currency, freely, convertible, to, gold, ii, a, limited, banknote, supply, based, on, a, fixed, relationship, to, the, gold, reserve, iii, free, movement, of, bullion, flows, from, 1819, and, lower, import, tariffs, on, food, and, raw, materials, from, 1842, often, loosely, referred, to, as, free, trade, iv, control, of, interest, rates, and, a, balanced, budget, in, order, to, reduce, the, national, debt, a, board, of, supervision, was, established, and, two, measures, passed, under, which, county, asylums, were, erected, and, prompt, medical, treatment, was, ensured, in, addition, it, was, provided, that, a, certificate, of, insanity, signed, by, two, disinterested, doctors, had, to, be, presented, before, any, person, was, confined, to, an, asylum, according, to, one, study, the, whole, treatment, of, lunacy, was, humanised, and, lifted, out, of, the, atmosphere, of, profits, into, that, of, curative, effort, and, civic, responsibility, peel, s, promise, of, modest, reform, was, held, to, and, the, second, most, famous, bill, of, this, ministry, while, reforming, in, 21st, century, eyes, was, in, fact, aimed, at, the, reformers, themselves, with, their, constituency, among, the, new, industrial, rich, the, factory, act, 1844, acted, more, against, these, industrialists, than, it, did, against, the, traditional, stronghold, of, the, conservatives, the, landed, gentry, by, restricting, the, number, of, hours, that, children, and, women, could, work, in, a, factory, and, setting, rudimentary, safety, standards, for, machinery, this, was, a, continuation, of, his, own, father, s, work, as, an, mp, as, the, elder, robert, peel, was, most, noted, for, the, reform, of, working, conditions, during, the, first, part, of, the, 19th, century, helping, him, was, lord, shaftesbury, a, british, mp, who, also, established, the, coal, mines, act, in, 1843, peel, was, the, target, of, a, failed, assassination, attempt, a, criminally, insane, scottish, woodturner, named, daniel, m, naghten, stalked, him, for, several, days, before, on, 20, january, killing, peel, s, personal, secretary, edward, drummond, thinking, he, was, peel, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, controversial, criminal, defence, of, insanity, the, most, notable, act, of, peel, s, second, ministry, however, was, the, one, that, would, bring, it, down, peel, moved, against, the, landholders, by, repealing, the, corn, laws, which, supported, agricultural, revenues, by, restricting, grain, imports, this, radical, break, with, conservative, protectionism, was, triggered, by, the, great, irish, famine, 1845, 1849, tory, agriculturalists, were, sceptical, of, the, extent, of, the, problem, and, peel, reacted, slowly, to, the, famine, famously, stating, in, october, 1846, already, in, opposition, there, is, such, a, tendency, to, exaggeration, and, inaccuracy, in, irish, reports, that, delay, in, acting, on, them, is, always, desirable, his, own, party, failed, to, support, the, bill, but, it, passed, with, whig, and, radical, support, on, the, third, reading, of, peel, s, bill, of, repeal, importation, act, 1846, on, 15, may, mps, voted, 327, votes, to, 229, a, majority, of, 98, to, repeal, the, corn, laws, on, 25, june, the, duke, of, wellington, persuaded, the, house, of, lords, to, pass, it, on, that, same, night, peel, s, irish, coercion, bill, was, defeated, in, the, commons, by, 292, to, 219, by, a, combination, of, whigs, radicals, and, tory, protectionists, following, this, on, 29, june, 1846, peel, resigned, as, prime, minister, though, he, knew, repealing, the, laws, would, mean, the, end, of, his, ministry, peel, decided, to, do, so, it, is, possible, that, peel, merely, used, the, irish, famine, as, an, excuse, to, repeal, the, corn, laws, as, he, had, been, an, intellectual, convert, to, free, trade, since, the, 1820s, blake, points, out, that, if, peel, had, been, convinced, that, total, repeal, was, necessary, to, stave, off, the, famine, he, would, have, enacted, a, bill, that, brought, about, immediate, temporary, repeal, not, permanent, repeal, over, a, three, year, period, of, gradual, tapering, off, of, duties, peel, s, support, for, free, trade, could, already, be, seen, in, his, 1842, and, 1845, budgets, in, late, 1842, graham, wrote, to, peel, that, the, next, change, in, the, corn, laws, must, be, to, an, open, trade, while, arguing, that, the, government, should, not, tackle, the, issue, speaking, to, the, cabinet, in, 1844, peel, argued, that, the, choice, was, the, maintenance, of, the, 1842, corn, law, or, total, repeal, the, historian, boyd, hilton, argued, that, peel, knew, from, 1844, he, was, going, to, be, deposed, as, the, conservative, leader, many, of, his, mps, had, taken, to, voting, against, him, and, the, rupture, within, the, party, between, liberals, and, paternalists, which, had, been, so, damaging, in, the, 1820s, but, masked, by, the, issue, of, parliamentary, reform, in, the, 1830s, was, brought, to, the, surface, over, the, corn, laws, hilton, s, hypothesis, is, that, peel, wished, to, be, deposed, on, a, liberal, issue, so, that, he, might, later, lead, a, peelite, whig, liberal, alliance, peel, was, magnanimous, towards, irish, famine, and, permitted, quick, settlements, of, disputes, at, frontiers, in, india, and, america, treaty, of, amritsar, 1846, on, 16, march, 1846, and, oregon, treaty, on, 15, june, 1846, in, order, to, repeal, corn, laws,
