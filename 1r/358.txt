during, the, rule, of, tsar, nicholas, i, the, political, climate, in, russia, was, stifling, for, many, writers, this, is, evident, in, the, despair, and, subsequent, death, of, gogol, and, the, oppression, persecution, and, arrests, of, artists, scientists, and, writers, during, this, time, thousands, of, russian, intellectuals, members, of, the, intelligentsia, emigrated, to, europe, among, them, were, alexander, herzen, and, turgenev, himself, who, moved, to, western, europe, in, 1854, although, this, decision, probably, had, more, to, do, with, his, fateful, love, for, pauline, viardot, than, anything, else, the, following, years, produced, the, novel, rudin, the, story, of, a, man, in, his, thirties, who, is, unable, to, put, his, talents, and, idealism, to, any, use, in, the, russia, of, nicholas, i, rudin, is, also, full, of, nostalgia, for, the, idealistic, student, circles, of, the, 1840s, following, the, thoughts, of, the, influential, critic, vissarion, belinsky,

period, of, 1853, 62, turgenev, wrote, some, of, his, finest, stories, as, well, as, the, first, four, of, his, novels, rudin, 1856, a, nest, of, the, gentry, 1859, on, the, eve, 1860, and, fathers, and, sons, 1862, some, themes, involved, in, these, works, include, the, beauty, of, early, love, failure, to, reach, one, s, dreams, and, frustrated, love, great, influences, on, these, works, are, derived, from, his, love, of, pauline, and, his, experiences, with, his, mother, who, controlled, over, 500, serfs, with, the, same, strict, demeanor, in, which, she, raised, him, in, 1858, turgenev, wrote, the, novel, a, nest, of, the, gentry, also, full, of, nostalgia, for, the, irretrievable, past, and, of, love, for, the, russian, countryside, it, contains, one, of, his, most, memorable, female, characters, liza, whom, dostoyevsky, paid, tribute, to, in, his, pushkin, speech, of, 1880, alongside, tatiana, and, tolstoy, s, natasha, rostova, alexander, ii, ascended, the, russian,

portraying, the, bulgarian, revolutionary, insarov, the, following, year, saw, the, publication, of, one, of, his, finest, novellas, first, love, which, was, based, on, bitter, sweet, childhood, memories, and, the, delivery, of, his, speech, hamlet, and, don, quixote, at, a, public, reading, in, saint, petersburg, in, aid, of, writers, and, scholars, suffering, hardship, the, vision, presented, therein, of, man, torn, between, the, self, centered, skepticism, of, hamlet, and, the, idealistic, generosity, of, don, quixote, is, one, that, can, be, said, to, pervade, turgenev, s, own, works, it, is, worth, noting, that, dostoyevsky, who, had, just, returned, from, exile, in, siberia, was, present, at, this, speech, for, eight, years, later, he, was, to, write, the, idiot, a, novel, whose, tragic, hero, prince, myshkin, resembles, don, quixote, in, many, respects, turgenev, whose, knowledge, of, spanish, thanks, to, his, contact, with, pauline, viardot, and, her, family, was, good, enough, for, him, to, have, considered, translating, cervantes, s, novel, into, russian, played, an, important, role, in, introducing, this, immortal, figure, of, world, literature, into, the, russian, context, fathers, and, sons, turgenev, s, most, famous, and, enduring, novel, appeared, in, 1862, its, leading, character, eugene, bazarov, considered, the, first, bolshevik, in, russian, literature, was, in, turn, heralded, and, reviled, as, either, a, glorification, or, a, parody, of, the, new, men, of, the, 1860s, the, novel, examined, the, conflict, between, the, older, generation, reluctant, to, accept, reforms, and, the, nihilistic, youth, in, the, central, character, bazarov, turgenev, drew, a, classical, portrait, of, the, mid, nineteenth, century, nihilist,

fathers, and, sons, prompted, turgenev, s, decision, to, leave, russia, as, a, consequence, he, also, lost, the, majority, of, his, readers, many, radical, critics, at, the, time, with, the, notable, exception, of, dimitri, pisarev, did, not, take, fathers, and, sons, seriously, and, after, the, relative, critical, failure, of, his, masterpiece, turgenev, was, disillusioned, and, started, to, write, less, turgenev, s, next, novel, smoke, was, published, in, 1867, and, was, again, received, less, than, enthusiastically, in, his, native, country, as, well, as, triggering, a, quarrel, with,

more, personal, nature, such, as, torrents, of, spring, king, lear, of, the, steppes, and, the, song, of, triumphant, love, were, also, written, in, these, autumnal, years, of, his, life, other, last, works, included, the, poems, in, prose, and, clara, milich, after, death, which, appeared, in, the, journal, european, messenger, turgenev, wrote, on, themes, similar, to, those, found, in, the, works, of, tolstoy, and, dostoyevsky, but, he, did, not, approve, of, the, religious, and, moral, preoccupations, that, his, two, great, contemporaries, brought, to, their, artistic, creation, turgenev, was, closer, in, temperament, to, his, friends, gustave, flaubert, and, theodor, storm, the, north, german, poet, and, master, of, the, novella, form, who, also, often, dwelt, on, memories, of, the, past, and, evoked, the, beauty, of, nature, turgenev, s, artistic, purity, made, him, a, favorite, of, like, minded, novelists, of, the, next, generation, such, as, henry, james, and, joseph, conrad, both, of, whom, greatly, preferred, turgenev, to, tolstoy, and, dostoyevsky, james, who, wrote, no, fewer, than, five, critical, essays, on, turgenev, s, work, claimed, that, his, merit, of, form, is, of, the, first, order, 1873, and, praised, his, exquisite, delicacy, which, makes, too, many, of, his, rivals, appear, to, hold, us, in, comparison, by, violent, means, and, introduce, us, in, comparison, to, vulgar, things, 1896, vladimir, nabokov, notorious, for, his, casual, dismissal, of, many, great, writers, praised, turgenev, s, plastic, musical, flowing, prose, but, criticized, his, labored, epilogues, and, banal, handling, of, plots, nabokov, stated, that, turgenev, is, not, a, great, writer, though, a, pleasant, one, and, ranked, him, fourth, among, nineteenth, century, russian, prose, writers, behind, tolstoy, gogol, and, anton, chekhov, but, ahead, of, dostoyevsky, his, idealistic, ideas, about, love, specifically, the, devotion, a, wife, should, show, her, husband, were, cynically, referred, to, by, characters, in, chekhov, s, an, anonymous, story, isaiah, berlin, acclaimed, turgenev, s, commitment, to, humanism, pluralism, and, gradual, reform, over, violent, revolution, as, representing, the, best, aspects, of, russian, liberalism, turgenev, was, known, for, his, pejorative, descriptions, of, jews, for, example, in, his, story, the, jew, 1847,
