long, reigning, louis, xiv, died, in, 1715, and, was, succeeded, by, the, five, year, old, louis, xv, these, national, transformations, had, a, great, impact, on, montesquieu, he, would, refer, to, them, repeatedly, in, his, work, montesquieu, eventually, withdrew, from, the, practice, of, law, to, devote, himself, to, study, and, writing, he, achieved, literary, success, with, the, publication, of, his, 1721, persian, letters, french, lettres, persanes, a, satire, representing, society, as, seen, through, the, eyes, of, two, persian, visitors, to, paris, cleverly, criticizing, absurdities, of, contemporary, french, society, the, work, was, an, instant, classic, and, accordingly, was, immediately, pirated, in, 1722, he, went, to, paris, and, entered, social, circles, with, the, help, of, friends, including, the, duke, of, berwick, whom, he, had, known, when, berwick, was, military, governor, at, bordeaux, he, also, acquainted, himself, with, the, english, politician, viscount, bolingbroke, some, of, whose, political, views, were, later, reflected, in, montesquieu, s, analysis, of, the, english, constitution, in, 1726, he, sold, his, office, bored, with, the, parlement, and, turning, more, toward, paris, in, time, despite, some, impediments, he, was, elected, to, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, january, 1728, in, april, 1728, with, berwick, s, nephew, lord, waldegrave,

went, to, england, at, the, end, of, october, 1729, in, the, company, of, lord, chesterfield, where, he, was, initiated, into, freemasonry, at, the, horn, tavern, lodge, in, westminster, he, remained, in, england, until, the, spring, of, 1731, when, he, returned, to, la, br, de, outwardly, he, seemed, to, be, settling, down, as, a, squire, he, altered, his, park, in, the, english, fashion, made, inquiries, into, his, own, genealogy, and, asserted, his, seignorial, rights, but, he, was, continuously, at, work, in, his, study, and, his, reflections, on, geography, laws, and, customs, during, his, travels, became, the, primary, sources, for, his, major, works, on, political, philosophy, at, this, time, he, next, published, considerations, on, the, causes, of, the, greatness, of, the, romans, and, their, decline, 1734, among, his, three, best, known, books, he, was, to, publish, the, spirit, of, law, in, 1748, quickly, translated, into, english, it, quickly, rose, to, influence, political, thought, profoundly, in, europe, and, america, in, france, the, book, met, with, an, enthusiastic, reception, by, many, but, was, denounced, by, the, sorbonne, and, in, 1751, by, the, catholic, church, index, of, prohibited, books, it, received, the, highest, praise, from, much, of, the, rest, of, europe, especially, britain, montesquieu, was, also, highly, regarded, in, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, as, a, champion, of, liberty, according, to, a, survey, of, late, eighteenth, century, works, by, political, scientist, donald, lutz, montesquieu, was, the, most, frequently, quoted, authority, on, government, and, politics, in, colonial, pre, revolutionary, british, america, cited, more, by, the, american, founders, than, any, source, except, for, the, bible, following, the, american, revolution, his, work, remained, a, powerful, influence, on, many, of, the, american, founders, most, notably, james, madison, of, virginia, the, father, of, the, constitution, montesquieu, s, philosophy, that, government, should, be, set, up, so, that, no, man, need, be, afraid, of, another, reminded, madison, and, others, that, a, free, and, stable, foundation, for, their, new, national, government, required, a, clearly, defined, and, balanced, separation, of, powers, montesquieu, was, troubled, by, a, cataract, and, feared, going, blind, at, the, end, of, 1754, he, visited, paris, and, was, soon, taken, ill, and, died, from, a, fever, on, 10, february, 1755, he, was, buried, in, the, glise, saint, sulpice, paris, montesquieu, s, philosophy, of, history, minimized, the, role, of, individual, persons, and, events, he, expounded, the, view, in, considerations, on, the, causes, of, the, greatness, of, the, romans, and, their, decline, that, each, historical, event, was, driven, by, a, principal, movement, it, is, not, chance, that, rules, the, world, ask, the, romans, who, had, a, continuous, sequence, of, successes, when, they, were, guided, by, a, certain, plan, and, an, uninterrupted, sequence, of, reverses, when, they, followed, another, there, are, general, causes, moral, and, physical, which, act, in, every, monarchy, elevating, it, maintaining, it, or, hurling, it, to, the, ground, all, accidents, are, controlled, by, these, causes, and, if, the, chance, of, one, battle, that, is, a, particular, cause, has, brought, a, state, to, ruin, some, general, cause, made, it, necessary, for, that, state, to, perish, from, a, single, battle, in, a, word, the, main, trend, draws, with, it, all, particular, accidents, in, discussing, the, transition, from, the, republic, to, the, empire, he, suggested, that, if, caesar, and, pompey, had, not, worked, to, usurp, the, government, of, the, republic, other, men, would, have, risen, in, their, place, the, cause, was, not, the, ambition, of, caesar, or, pompey, but, the, ambition, of, man, former, former, montesquieu, is, credited, as, being, among, the, progenitors, who, include, herodotus, and, tacitus, of, anthropology, as, being, among, the, first, to, extend, comparative, methods, of, classification, to, the, political, forms, in, human, societies, indeed, the, french, political, anthropologist, georges, balandier, considered, montesquieu, to, be, the, initiator, of, a, scientific, enterprise, that, for, a, time, performed, the, role, of, cultural, and, social, anthropology, according, to, social, anthropologist, d, f, pocock, montesquieu, s, the, spirit, of, law, was, the, first, consistent, attempt, to, survey, the, varieties, of, human, society, to, classify, and, compare, them, and, within, society, to, study, the, inter, functioning, of, institutions, mile, durkheim, notes, david, w, carrithers, even, went, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, it, was, precisely, this, realization, of, the, interrelatedness, of, social, phenomena, that, brought, social, science, into, being, montesquieu, s, political, anthropology, gave, rise, to, his, influential, view, that, forms, of, government, are, supported, by, governing, principles, virtue, for, republics, honor, for, monarchies, and, fear, for, despotisms, american, founders, studied, montesquieu, s, views, on, how, the, english, achieved, liberty, by, separating, executive, legislative, and, judicial, powers, and, when, catherine, the, great, wrote, her, nakaz, instruction, for, the, legislative, assembly, she, had, created, to, clarify, the, existing, russian, law, code, she, avowed, borrowing, heavily, from, montesquieu, s, spirit, of, law, although, she, discarded, or, altered, portions, that, did, not, support, russia, s, absolutist, bureaucratic, monarchy, montesquieu, s, most, influential, work, divided, french, society, into, three, classes, or, trias, politica, a, term, he, coined, the, monarchy, the, aristocracy, and, the, commons, montesquieu, saw, two, types, of, governmental, power, existing, the, sovereign, and, the, administrative, the, administrative, powers, were, the, executive, the, legislative, and, the, judicial, these, should, be, separate, from, and, dependent, upon, each, other, so, that, the, influence, of, any, one, power, would, not, be, able, to, exceed, that, of, the, other, two, either, singly, or, in, combination, this, was, a, radical, idea, because, it, does, not, follow, the, three, estates, structure, of, the, french, monarchy, the, clergy, the, aristocracy, and, the, people, at, large, represented, by, the, estates, general, thereby, erasing, the, last, vestige, of, a, feudalistic, structure, the, theory, of, the, separation, of, powers, largely, derives, from, the, spirit, of, law, in, every, state, there, are, three, kinds, of, power, the, legislative, authority, the, executive, authority, for, things, that, stem, from, the, law, of, nations, and, the, executive, authority, for, those, that, stem, from, civil, law, by, virtue, of, the, first, the, prince, or, magistrate, enacts, temporary, or, perpetual, laws, and, amends, or, abrogates, those, that, have, been, already, enacted, by, the, second, he, makes, peace, or, war, sends, or, receives, embassies, establishes, the, public, security, and, provides, against, invasions, by, the, third, he, punishes, criminals, or, determines, the, disputes, that, arise, between, individuals, the, latter, we, shall, call, the, judiciary, power, and, the, other, simply, the, executive, power, of, the, state, montesquieu, argues, that, each, power, should, only, exercise, its, own, functions, he, is, quite, explicit, here, when, in, the, same, person, or, in, the, same, body, of, magistracy, the, legislative, authority, is, combined, with, the, executive, authority, there, is, no, freedom, because, one, can, fear, lest, the, same, monarch, or, the, same, senate, make, tyrannical, laws, in, order, to, carry, them, out, tyrannically, again, there, is, no, freedom, if, the, authority, to, judge, is, not, separated, from, the, legislative, and, executive, authorities, if, it, were, combined, with, the, legislative, authority, power, over, the, life, and, liberty, of, the, citizens, would, be, arbitrary, for, the, judge, would, be, the, legislator, if, it, were, combined, with, the, executive, authority, the, judge, could, have, the, strength, of, an, oppressor, all, would, be, lost, if, the, same, man, or, the, same, body, of, principals, or, of, nobles, or, of, the, people, exercised, these, three, powers, that, of, making, laws, that, of, executing, public, resolutions, and, that, of, judging, crimes, or, disputes, between, individuals, if, the, legislative, branch, appoints, the, executive, and, judicial, powers, as, montesquieu, indicated, there, will, be, no, separation, or, division, of, its, powers, since, the, power, to, appoint, carries, with, it, the, power, to, revoke, the, executive, authority, must, be, in, the, hands, of, a, monarch, for, this, part, of, the, government, which, almost, always, requires, immediate, action, is, better, administrated, by, one, than, by, several, whereas, that, which, depends, on, the, legislative, authority, is, often, better, organized, by, several, than, by, one, person, alone, if, there, were, no, monarch, and, the, executive, authority, were, entrusted, to, a, certain, number, of, persons, chosen, from, the, legislative, body, that, would, be, the, end, of, freedom, because, the, two, authorities, would, be, combined, the, same, persons, sometimes, having, and, always, in, a, position, to, have, a, role, in, both, montesquieu, identifies, three, main, forms, of, government, each, supported, by, a, social, principle, monarchies, free, governments, headed, by, a, hereditary, figure, e, g, king, queen, emperor, which, rely, on, the, principle, of, honor, republics, free, governments, headed, by, popularly, elected, leaders, which, rely, on, the, principle, of, virtue, and, despotisms, unfree, headed, by, despots, which, rely, on, fear, the, free, governments, are, dependent, on, constitutional, arrangements, that, establish, checks, and, balances, montesquieu, devotes, one, chapter, of, the, spirit, of, law, to, a, discussion, of, how, the, england, s, constitution, sustained, liberty, xi, 6, and, another, to, the, realities, of, english, politics, xix, 27, as, for, france, the, intermediate, powers, including, the, nobility, the, nobility, and, the, parlements, had, been, weakened, by, louis, xiv, and, welcomed, the, strengthening, of, parlementary, power, in, 1715, montesquieu, advocated, reform, of, slavery, in, the, spirit, of, law, specifically, arguing, that, slavery, was, inherently, wrong, because, all, humans, are, born, equal, but, that, it, could, perhaps, be, justified, within, the, context, of, climates, with, intense, heat, wherein, laborers, would, feel, less, inclined, to, work, voluntarily, as, part, of, his, advocacy, he, presented, a, satirical, hypothetical, list, of, arguments, for, slavery, in, the, hypothetical, list, he, d, ironically, list, pro, slavery, arguments, without, further, comment, including, an, argument, stating, that, sugar, would, become, too, expensive, without, the, free, labor, of, slaves, while, addressing, french, readers, of, his, general, theory, john, maynard, keynes, described, montesquieu, as, the, real, french, equivalent, of, adam, smith, the, greatest, of, your, economists, head, and, shoulders, above, the, physiocrats, in, penetration, clear, headedness, and, good, sense, which, are, the, qualities, an, economist, should, have, another, example, of, montesquieu, s, anthropological, thinking, outlined, in, the, spirit, of, law, and, hinted, at, in, persian, letters, is, his, meteorological, climate, theory, which, holds, that, climate, may, substantially, influence, the, nature, of, man, and, his, society, a, theory, also, promoted, by, the, french, naturalist, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, by, placing, an, emphasis, on, environmental, influences, as, a, material, condition, of, life, montesquieu, prefigured, modern, anthropology, s, concern, with, the, impact, of, material, conditions, such, as, available, energy, sources, organized, production, systems, and, technologies, on, the, growth, of, complex, socio, cultural, systems, he, goes, so, far, as, to, assert, that, certain, climates, are, more, favorable, than, others, the, temperate, climate, of, france, being, ideal, his, view, is, that, people, living, in, very, warm, countries, are, too, hot, tempered, while, those, in, northern, countries, are, icy, or, stiff, the, climate, of, middle, europe, is, therefore, optimal, on, this, point, montesquieu, may, well, have, been, influenced, by, a, similar, pronouncement, in, the, histories, of, herodotus, where, he, makes, a, distinction, between, the, ideal, temperate, climate, of, greece, as, opposed, to, the, overly, cold, climate, of, scythia, and, the, overly, warm, climate, of, egypt, this, was, a, common, belief, at, the, time, and, can, also, be, found, within, the, medical, writings, of, herodotus, times, including, the, on, airs, waters, places, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, one, can, find, a, similar, statement, in, germania, by, tacitus, one, of, montesquieu, s, favorite, authors, philip, m, parker, in, his, book, physioeconomics, mit, press, 2000, endorses, montesquieu, s, theory, and, argues, that, much, of, the, economic, variation, between, countries, is, explained, by, the, physiological, effect, of, different, climates, from, a, sociological, perspective, louis, althusser, in, his, analysis, of, montesquieu, s, revolution, in, method, alluded, to, the, seminal, character, of, anthropology, s, inclusion, of, material, factors, such, as, climate, in, the, explanation, of, social, dynamics, and, political, forms, examples, of, certain, climatic, and, geographical, factors, giving, rise, to, increasingly, complex, social, systems, include, those, that, were, conducive, to, the, rise, of, agriculture, and, the, domestication, of, wild, plants, and, animals, between, 1981, and, 1994, a, depiction, of, monetesquieu, appeared, on, the, 200, french, franc, note, since, 1989, the, annual, montesquieu, prize, has, been, awarded, by, the, french, association, of, historians, of, political, ideas, for, the, best, french, language, thesis, on, the, history, of, political, thought, on, europe, day, 2007, the, montesquieu, institute, opened, in, the, hague, the, netherlands, with, a, mission, to, advance, research, and, education, on, the, parliamentary, history, and, political, culture, of, the, european, union, and, its, member, states, the, montesquieu, tower, in, luxembourg, was, completed, in,
