nanda, pali, and, sanskrit, 5th, 4th, century, bce, was, the, primary, attendant, of, the, buddha, and, one, of, his, ten, principal, disciples, among, the, buddha, s, many, disciples, nanda, stood, out, for, having, the, best, memory, most, of, the, texts, of, the, early, buddhist, sutta, pi, aka, pali, sanskrit, s, tra, pi, aka, are, attributed, to, his, recollection, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, during, the, first, buddhist, council, for, that, reason, he, is, known, as, the, treasurer, of, the, dhamma, with, dhamma, sanskrit, dharma, referring, to, the, buddha, s, teaching, in, early, buddhist, texts, nanda, was, the, first, cousin, of, the, buddha, although, the, early, texts, do, not, agree, on, many, parts, of, nanda, s, early, life, they, do, agree, that, nanda, was, ordained, as, a, monk, and, that, pu, a, mant, n, putta, sanskrit, p, r, a, maitr, ya, putra, became, his, teacher, twenty, years, in, the, buddha, s, ministry, nanda, became, the, attendant, of, the, buddha, when, the, buddha, selected, him, for, this, task, nanda, performed, his, duties, with, great, devotion, and, care, and, acted, as, an, intermediary, between, the, buddha, and, the, laypeople, as, well, as, the, sa, gha, sanskrit, romanized, sa, gha, lit, monastic, community, he, accompanied, the, buddha, for, the, rest, of, his, life, acting, not, only, as, an, assistant, but, also, a, secretary, and, a, mouthpiece, scholars, are, skeptical, about, the, historicity, of, many, events, in, nanda, s, life, especially, the, first, council, and, consensus, about, this, has, yet, to, be, established, a, traditional, account, can, be, drawn, from, early, texts, commentaries, and, post, canonical, chronicles, nanda, had, an, important, role, in, establishing, the, order, of, bhikkhun, s, sanskrit, romanized, bhik, u, lit, female, mendicant, when, he, requested, the, buddha, on, behalf, of, the, latter, s, foster, mother, mah, paj, pati, gotam, sanskrit, mah, praj, pat, gautam, to, allow, her, to, be, ordained, nanda, also, accompanied, the, buddha, in, the, last, year, of, his, life, and, therefore, was, witness, to, many, tenets, and, principles, that, the, buddha, conveyed, before, his, death, including, the, well, known, principle, that, the, buddhist, community, should, take, his, teaching, and, discipline, as, their, refuge, and, that, he, would, not, appoint, a, new, leader, the, final, period, of, the, buddha, s, life, also, shows, that, nanda, was, very, much, attached, to, the, buddha, s, person, and, he, saw, the, buddha, s, passing, with, great, sorrow, shortly, after, the, buddha, s, death, the, first, council, was, convened, and, nanda, managed, to, attain, enlightenment, just, before, the, council, started, which, was, a, requirement, he, had, a, historical, role, during, the, council, as, the, living, memory, of, the, buddha, reciting, many, of, the, buddha, s, discourses, and, checking, them, for, accuracy, during, the, same, council, however, he, was, chastised, by, mah, kassapa, sanskrit, mah, k, yapa, and, the, rest, of, the, sa, gha, for, allowing, women, to, be, ordained, and, failing, to, understand, or, respect, the, buddha, at, several, crucial, moments, nanda, continued, to, teach, until, the, end, of, his, life, passing, on, his, spiritual, heritage, to, his, pupils, s, av, s, sanskrit, akav, s, and, majjhantika, sanskrit, madhy, ntika, among, others, who, later, assumed, leading, roles, in, the, second, and, third, councils, nanda, died, 20, years, after, the, buddha, and, st, pas, monuments, were, erected, at, the, river, where, he, died, nanda, is, one, of, the, most, loved, figures, in, buddhism, he, was, known, for, his, memory, erudition, and, compassion, and, was, often, praised, by, the, buddha, for, these, matters, he, functioned, as, a, foil, to, the, buddha, however, in, that, he, still, had, worldly, attachments, and, was, not, yet, enlightened, as, opposed, to, the, buddha, in, the, sanskrit, textual, traditions, nanda, is, considered, the, patriarch, of, the, dhamma, who, stood, in, a, spiritual, lineage, receiving, the, teaching, from, mah, kassapa, and, passing, them, on, to, his, own, pupils, nanda, has, been, honored, by, bhikkhun, s, since, early, medieval, times, for, his, merits, in, establishing, the, nun, s, order, in, recent, times, the, composer, richard, wagner, and, indian, poet, rabindranath, tagore, were, inspired, by, stories, about, nanda, in, their, work, the, word, nanda, means, bliss, joy, in, p, li, and, in, sanskrit, p, li, commentaries, explain, that, when, nanda, was, born, his, relatives, were, joyous, about, this, texts, from, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, tradition, however, state, that, since, nanda, was, born, on, the, day, of, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, there, was, great, rejoicing, in, the, city, hence, the, name, according, to, the, texts, in, a, previous, life, nanda, made, an, aspiration, to, become, a, buddha, s, attendant, he, made, this, aspiration, in, the, time, of, a, previous, buddha, called, padumuttara, many, eons, pali, kappa, sanskrit, kalpa, before, the, present, age, he, met, the, attendant, of, padumuttara, buddha, and, aspired, to, be, like, him, in, a, future, life, after, having, done, many, good, deeds, he, made, his, resolution, known, to, the, padumuttara, buddha, who, confirmed, that, his, wish, will, come, true, in, a, future, life, after, having, been, born, and, reborn, throughout, many, lifetimes, and, doing, many, good, deeds, he, was, born, as, nanda, in, the, time, of, the, current, buddha, gotama, nanda, was, born, in, the, same, time, period, as, the, buddha, formerly, prince, siddhattha, which, scholars, place, at, 5th, 4th, centuries, bce, tradition, says, that, nanda, was, the, first, cousin, of, the, buddha, his, father, being, the, brother, of, suddhodana, sanskrit, uddhodana, the, buddha, s, father, in, the, p, li, and, m, lasarv, stiv, da, textual, traditions, his, father, was, amitodana, sanskrit, am, todana, but, the, mah, vastu, states, that, his, father, was, uklodana, both, are, brothers, of, suddhodana, the, mah, vastu, also, mentions, that, nanda, s, mother, s, name, was, m, g, sanskrit, lit, little, deer, p, li, is, unknown, the, p, li, tradition, has, it, that, nanda, was, born, on, the, same, day, as, prince, siddhatta, sanskrit, siddh, rtha, but, texts, from, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, and, subsequent, mah, y, na, traditions, state, nanda, was, born, at, the, same, time, the, buddha, attained, enlightenment, when, prince, siddhattha, was, 35, years, old, and, was, therefore, much, younger, than, the, buddha, the, latter, tradition, is, corroborated, by, several, instances, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, in, which, nanda, appears, younger, than, the, buddha, such, as, the, passage, in, which, the, buddha, explained, to, nanda, how, old, age, was, affecting, him, in, body, and, mind, it, is, also, corroborated, by, a, verse, in, the, p, li, text, called, therag, th, in, which, nanda, stated, he, was, a, learner, for, 25, years, after, which, he, attended, to, the, buddha, for, another, 25, years, following, the, p, li, mah, asaka, and, dharmaguptaka, textual, traditions, nanda, became, a, monk, in, the, second, year, of, the, buddha, s, ministry, during, the, buddha, s, visit, to, kapilavatthu, sanskrit, kapilavastu, he, was, ordained, by, the, buddha, himself, together, with, many, other, princes, of, the, buddha, s, clan, pali, s, kiya, sanskrit, kya, in, the, mango, grove, called, anupiya, part, of, malla, territory, according, to, a, text, from, the, mah, sa, ghika, tradition, king, suddhodana, wanted, the, buddha, to, have, more, followers, of, the, khattiya, caste, sanskrit, k, atriya, lit, warrior, noble, member, of, the, ruling, class, and, less, from, the, brahmin, priest, caste, he, therefore, ordered, that, any, khattiya, who, had, a, brother, follow, the, buddha, as, a, monk, or, had, his, brother, do, so, nanda, used, this, opportunity, and, asked, his, brother, devadatta, to, stay, at, home, so, that, he, could, leave, for, the, monkhood, the, later, timeline, from, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, and, the, p, li, therag, th, however, have, nanda, ordain, much, later, about, twenty, five, years, before, the, buddha, s, death, in, other, words, twenty, years, in, the, buddha, s, ministry, some, sanskrit, sources, have, him, ordain, even, later, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, on, monastic, discipline, p, li, and, sanskrit, vinaya, relate, that, soothsayers, predicted, nanda, would, be, the, buddha, s, attendant, in, order, to, prevent, nanda, from, leaving, the, palace, to, ordain, his, father, brought, him, to, ves, l, sanskrit, vai, l, during, the, buddha, s, visit, to, kapilavatthu, but, later, the, buddha, met, and, taught, nanda, nonetheless, on, a, similar, note, the, mah, vastu, relates, however, that, m, g, was, initially, opposed, to, nanda, joining, the, holy, life, because, his, brother, devadatta, had, already, ordained, and, left, the, palace, nanda, responded, to, his, mother, s, resistance, by, moving, to, videha, sanskrit, vaideha, and, lived, there, taking, a, vow, of, silence, this, led, him, to, gain, the, epithet, videhamuni, sanskrit, vaidehamuni, meaning, the, silent, wise, one, from, videha, when, nanda, did, become, ordained, his, father, had, him, ordain, in, kapilavatthu, in, the, nigrodh, r, ma, monastery, sanskrit, niyagrodh, r, ma, with, much, ceremony, nanda, s, preceptor, pali, upajjh, ya, sanskrit, up, dhy, ya, being, a, certain, da, ab, la, k, yapa, according, to, the, p, li, tradition, nanda, s, first, teachers, were, bela, has, sa, and, pu, a, mant, n, putta, it, was, pu, a, s, teaching, that, led, nanda, to, attain, the, stage, of, sot, panna, sanskrit, rot, panna, an, attainment, preceding, that, of, enlightenment, nanda, later, expressed, his, debt, to, pu, a, another, important, figure, in, the, life, of, nanda, was, s, riputta, sanskrit, riputra, one, of, the, buddha, s, main, disciples, s, riputta, often, taught, nanda, about, the, finer, points, of, buddhist, doctrine, they, were, in, the, habit, of, sharing, things, with, one, another, and, their, relationship, is, described, as, a, good, friendship, in, some, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, an, attendant, of, nanda, is, also, mentioned, who, helped, motivate, nanda, when, he, was, banned, from, the, first, buddhist, council, he, was, a, vajjiputta, sanskrit, v, jjiputra, i, e, someone, who, originated, from, the, vajji, confederacy, according, to, later, texts, an, enlightened, monk, also, called, vajjiputta, sanskrit, vajraputra, had, an, important, role, in, nanda, s, life, he, listened, to, a, teaching, of, nanda, and, realized, that, nanda, was, not, enlightened, yet, vajjiputta, encouraged, nanda, to, talk, less, to, laypeople, and, deepen, his, meditation, practice, by, retreating, in, the, forest, advice, that, very, much, affected, nanda, in, the, first, twenty, years, of, the, buddha, s, ministry, the, buddha, had, several, personal, attendants, however, after, these, twenty, years, when, the, buddha, was, aged, 55, the, buddha, announced, that, he, had, need, for, a, permanent, attendant, the, buddha, had, been, growing, older, and, his, previous, attendants, had, not, done, their, job, very, well, initially, several, of, the, buddha, s, foremost, disciples, responded, to, his, request, but, the, buddha, did, not, accept, them, all, the, while, nanda, remained, quiet, when, he, was, asked, why, he, said, that, the, buddha, would, know, best, whom, to, choose, upon, which, the, buddha, responded, by, choosing, nanda, nanda, agreed, to, take, on, the, position, on, the, condition, that, he, did, not, receive, any, material, benefits, from, the, buddha, accepting, such, benefits, would, open, him, up, to, criticism, that, he, chose, the, position, because, of, ulterior, motives, he, also, requested, that, the, buddha, allow, him, to, accept, invitations, on, his, behalf, allow, him, to, ask, questions, about, his, doctrine, and, repeat, any, teaching, that, the, buddha, had, taught, in, nanda, s, absence, these, requests, would, help, people, trust, nanda, and, show, that, the, buddha, was, sympathetic, to, his, attendant, furthermore, nanda, considered, these, the, real, advantages, of, being, an, attendant, which, is, why, he, requested, them, the, buddha, agreed, to, nanda, s, conditions, and, nanda, became, the, buddha, s, attendant, accompanying, the, buddha, on, most, of, his, wanderings, nanda, took, care, of, the, buddha, s, daily, practical, needs, by, doing, things, such, as, bringing, water, and, cleaning, the, buddha, s, dwelling, place, he, is, depicted, as, observant, and, devoted, even, guarding, the, dwelling, place, at, night, nanda, takes, the, part, of, interlocutor, in, many, of, the, recorded, dialogues, he, tended, the, buddha, for, a, total, of, 25, years, a, duty, which, entailed, much, work, his, relationship, with, the, buddha, is, depicted, as, warm, and, trusting, when, the, buddha, grew, ill, nanda, had, a, sympathetic, illness, when, the, buddha, grew, older, nanda, kept, taking, care, of, him, with, devotion, nanda, sometimes, literally, risked, his, life, for, his, teacher, at, one, time, the, rebellious, monk, devadatta, tried, to, kill, the, buddha, by, having, a, drunk, and, wild, elephant, released, in, the, buddha, s, presence, nanda, stepped, in, front, of, the, buddha, to, protect, him, when, the, buddha, told, him, to, move, he, refused, although, normally, he, always, obeyed, the, buddha, through, a, supernatural, accomplishment, pali, iddhi, sanskrit, iddhi, the, buddha, then, moved, nanda, aside, and, subdued, the, elephant, by, touching, it, and, speaking, to, it, with, loving, kindness, nanda, often, acted, as, an, intermediary, and, secretary, passing, on, messages, from, the, buddha, informing, the, buddha, of, news, invitations, or, the, needs, of, lay, people, and, advising, lay, people, who, wanted, to, provide, gifts, to, the, sa, gha, at, one, time, mah, paj, pat, the, buddha, s, foster, mother, requested, to, offer, robes, for, personal, use, for, the, buddha, she, said, that, even, though, she, had, raised, the, buddha, in, his, youth, she, never, gave, anything, in, person, to, the, young, prince, she, now, wished, to, do, so, the, buddha, initially, insisted, that, she, give, the, robe, to, the, community, as, a, whole, rather, than, to, be, attached, to, his, person, however, nanda, interceded, and, mediated, suggesting, that, the, buddha, had, better, accept, the, robe, eventually, the, buddha, did, but, not, without, pointing, out, to, nanda, that, good, deeds, like, giving, should, always, be, done, for, the, sake, of, the, action, itself, not, for, the, sake, of, the, person, the, texts, say, that, the, buddha, sometimes, asked, nanda, to, substitute, for, him, as, teacher, and, was, often, praised, by, the, buddha, for, his, teachings, nanda, was, often, given, important, teaching, roles, such, as, regularly, teaching, queen, mallik, queen, s, m, vat, sanskrit, y, m, vat, and, other, people, from, the, ruling, class, once, nanda, taught, a, number, of, king, udena, sanskrit, udayana, s, concubines, they, were, so, impressed, by, nanda, s, teaching, that, they, gave, him, five, hundred, robes, which, nanda, accepted, having, heard, about, this, king, udena, criticized, nanda, for, being, greedy, nanda, responded, by, explaining, how, every, single, robe, was, carefully, used, reused, and, recycled, by, the, monastic, community, prompting, the, king, to, offer, another, five, hundred, robes, nanda, also, had, a, role, in, the, buddha, s, visit, to, ves, l, in, this, story, the, buddha, taught, the, well, known, text, ratana, sutta, to, nanda, which, nanda, then, recited, in, ves, l, ridding, the, city, from, illness, drought, and, evil, spirits, in, the, process, another, well, known, passage, in, which, the, buddha, taught, nanda, is, the, passage, about, spiritual, friendship, pali, kaly, amittata, in, this, passage, nanda, stated, that, spiritual, friendship, is, half, of, the, holy, life, the, buddha, corrected, nanda, stating, that, such, friendship, is, the, entire, holy, life, in, summary, nanda, worked, as, an, assistant, intermediary, and, a, mouthpiece, helping, the, buddha, in, many, ways, and, learning, his, teachings, in, the, process, nanda, was, attractive, in, appearance, a, p, li, account, related, that, a, bhikkhun, nun, became, enamored, with, nanda, and, pretended, to, be, ill, to, have, nanda, visit, her, when, she, realized, the, error, of, her, ways, she, confessed, her, mistakes, to, nanda, other, accounts, relate, that, a, low, caste, woman, called, prak, ti, also, known, in, china, as, m, d, ngqi, n, fell, in, love, with, nanda, and, persuaded, her, mother, m, ta, g, to, use, a, black, magic, spell, to, enchant, him, this, succeeded, and, nanda, was, lured, into, her, house, but, came, to, his, senses, and, called, upon, the, help, of, the, buddha, the, buddha, then, taught, prak, ti, to, reflect, on, the, repulsive, qualities, of, the, human, body, and, eventually, prak, ti, was, ordained, as, a, bhikkhun, giving, up, her, attachment, for, nanda, in, an, east, asian, version, of, the, story, in, the, ra, gamas, tra, the, buddha, sent, ma, ju, r, to, help, nanda, who, used, recitation, to, counter, the, magic, charm, the, buddha, then, continued, by, teaching, nanda, and, other, listeners, about, the, buddha, nature, in, the, role, of, mediator, between, the, buddha, and, the, lay, communities, nanda, sometimes, made, suggestions, to, the, buddha, for, amendments, in, the, monastic, discipline, most, importantly, the, early, texts, attribute, the, inclusion, of, women, in, the, early, sa, gha, monastic, order, to, nanda, fifteen, years, after, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, his, foster, mother, mah, paj, pat, came, to, see, him, to, ask, him, to, be, ordained, as, the, first, buddhist, bhikkhun, initially, the, buddha, refused, this, five, years, later, mah, paj, pat, came, to, request, the, buddha, again, this, time, with, a, following, of, other, s, kiya, women, including, the, buddha, s, former, wife, yasodhar, sanskrit, ya, odar, they, had, walked, 500, kilometres, 310, mi, looked, dirty, tired, and, depressed, and, nanda, felt, pity, for, them, nanda, therefore, confirmed, with, the, buddha, whether, women, could, become, enlightened, as, well, although, the, buddha, conceded, this, he, did, not, allow, the, s, kiya, women, to, be, ordained, yet, nanda, then, discussed, with, the, buddha, how, mah, paj, pat, took, care, of, him, during, his, childhood, after, the, death, of, his, real, mother, nanda, also, mentioned, that, previous, buddhas, had, also, ordained, bhikkhun, s, in, the, end, the, buddha, allowed, the, s, kiya, women, to, be, ordained, being, the, start, of, the, bhikkhun, order, nanda, had, mah, paj, pati, ordained, by, her, acceptance, of, a, set, of, rules, set, by, the, buddha, these, came, to, be, known, as, the, garudhamma, and, they, describe, the, subordinate, relation, of, the, bhikkhun, community, to, that, of, the, bhikkhus, or, monks, scholar, of, asian, religions, reiko, ohnuma, argues, that, the, debt, the, buddha, had, toward, his, foster, mother, mah, paj, pati, may, have, been, the, main, reason, for, his, concessions, with, regard, to, the, establishment, of, a, bhikkhun, order, many, scholars, interpret, this, account, to, mean, that, the, buddha, was, reluctant, in, allowing, women, to, be, ordained, and, that, nanda, successfully, persuaded, the, buddha, to, change, his, mind, for, example, indologist, and, translator, i, b, horner, wrote, that, this, is, the, only, instance, of, his, being, over, persuaded, in, argument, however, some, scholars, interpret, the, buddha, s, initial, refusal, rather, as, a, test, of, resolve, following, a, widespread, pattern, in, the, p, li, canon, and, in, monastic, procedure, of, repeating, a, request, three, times, before, final, acceptance, some, also, argue, that, the, buddha, was, believed, by, buddhists, to, be, omniscient, and, therefore, is, unlikely, to, have, been, depicted, as, changing, his, mind, other, scholars, argue, that, other, passages, in, the, texts, indicate, the, buddha, intended, all, along, to, establish, a, bhikkhun, order, regardless, during, the, acceptance, of, women, into, the, monastic, order, the, buddha, told, nanda, that, the, buddha, s, dispensation, would, last, shorter, because, of, this, at, the, time, the, buddhist, monastic, order, consisted, of, wandering, celibate, males, without, many, monastic, institutions, allowing, women, to, join, the, buddhist, celibate, life, might, have, led, to, dissension, as, well, as, temptation, between, the, sexes, the, garudhamma, however, were, meant, to, fix, these, problems, and, prevent, the, dispensation, from, being, curtailed, there, are, some, chronological, discrepancies, in, the, traditional, account, of, the, setting, up, of, the, bhikkhun, order, according, to, the, p, li, and, mah, asaka, textual, traditions, the, bhikkhun, order, was, set, up, five, years, after, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, but, according, to, most, textual, traditions, nanda, only, became, attendant, twenty, years, after, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, furthermore, mah, paj, pati, was, the, buddha, s, foster, mother, and, must, therefore, have, been, considerably, older, than, him, however, after, the, bhikkhun, order, was, established, mah, paj, pati, still, had, many, audiences, with, the, buddha, as, reported, in, p, li, and, chinese, early, buddhist, texts, because, of, this, and, other, reasons, it, could, be, inferred, that, establishment, of, the, bhikkhun, order, actually, took, place, early, in, the, buddha, s, ministry, if, this, is, the, case, nanda, s, role, in, establishing, the, order, becomes, less, likely, some, scholars, therefore, interpret, the, names, in, the, account, such, as, nanda, and, mah, paj, pati, as, symbols, representing, groups, rather, than, specific, individuals, according, to, the, texts, nanda, s, role, in, founding, the, bhikkhun, order, made, him, popular, with, the, bhikkhun, community, nanda, often, taught, bhikkhun, s, often, encouraged, women, to, ordain, and, when, he, was, criticized, by, the, monk, mah, kassapa, several, bhikkhun, s, tried, to, defend, him, according, to, indologist, oskar, von, hin, ber, nanda, s, pro, bhikkhun, attitude, may, well, be, the, reason, why, there, was, frequent, discussion, between, nanda, and, mah, kassapa, eventually, leading, mah, kasapa, to, charge, nanda, with, several, offenses, during, the, first, buddhist, council, von, hin, ber, further, argues, that, the, establishment, of, the, bhikkhun, order, may, have, well, been, initiated, by, nanda, after, the, buddha, s, death, and, the, introduction, of, mah, paj, pati, as, the, person, requesting, to, do, so, is, merely, a, literary, device, to, connect, the, ordination, of, women, with, the, person, of, the, buddha, through, his, foster, mother, von, hin, ber, concludes, this, based, on, several, patterns, in, the, early, texts, including, the, apparent, distance, between, the, buddha, and, the, bhikkhun, order, and, the, frequent, discussions, and, differences, of, opinion, that, take, place, between, nanda, and, mah, kassapa, some, scholars, have, seen, merits, in, von, hin, ber, s, argument, with, regard, to, the, pro, and, anti, factions, but, as, of, 2017, no, definitive, evidence, has, been, found, for, the, theory, of, establishment, of, the, bhikkhuni, order, after, the, buddha, s, death, buddhist, studies, scholar, bhikkhu, an, layo, has, responded, to, most, of, von, hinuber, s, arguments, writing, besides, requiring, too, many, assumptions, this, hypothesis, conflicts, with, nearly, all, the, evidence, preserved, in, the, texts, together, arguing, that, it, was, monastic, discipline, that, created, a, distance, between, the, buddha, and, the, bhikkhun, s, and, even, so, there, were, many, places, in, the, early, texts, where, the, buddha, did, address, bhikkhun, s, directly, despite, his, long, association, with, and, close, proximity, to, the, buddha, the, texts, describe, that, nanda, had, not, become, enlightened, yet, because, of, that, a, fellow, monk, ud, y, sanskrit, ud, yin, ridiculed, nanda, however, the, buddha, reprimanded, ud, y, in, response, saying, that, nanda, would, certainly, be, enlightened, in, this, life, the, p, li, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, related, the, last, year, long, trip, the, buddha, took, with, nanda, from, r, jagaha, sanskrit, r, jag, ha, to, the, small, town, of, kusin, r, sanskrit, ku, inagara, before, the, buddha, died, there, before, reaching, kusin, r, the, buddha, spent, the, retreat, during, the, monsoon, pali, vassa, sanskrit, var, in, ve, ug, ma, sanskrit, ve, ugr, maka, getting, out, of, the, ves, l, area, which, suffered, from, famine, here, the, eighty, year, old, buddha, expressed, his, wish, to, speak, to, the, sa, gha, once, more, the, buddha, had, grown, seriously, ill, in, ves, l, much, to, the, concern, of, some, of, his, disciples, nanda, understood, that, the, buddha, wished, to, leave, final, instructions, before, his, death, the, buddha, stated, however, that, he, had, already, taught, everything, needed, without, withholding, anything, secret, as, a, teacher, with, a, closed, fist, would, he, also, impressed, upon, nanda, that, he, did, not, think, the, sa, gha, should, be, reliant, too, much, on, a, leader, not, even, himself, he, then, continued, with, the, well, known, statement, to, take, his, teaching, as, a, refuge, and, oneself, as, a, refuge, without, relying, on, any, other, refuge, also, after, he, would, be, gone, bareau, argued, that, this, is, one, of, the, most, ancient, parts, of, the, text, found, in, slight, variation, in, five, early, textual, traditions, moreover, this, very, beautiful, episode, touching, with, nobility, and, psychological, verisimilitude, with, regard, to, both, nanda, and, the, buddha, seems, to, go, back, very, far, at, the, time, when, the, authors, like, the, other, disciples, still, considered, the, blessed, one, a, man, an, eminently, respectable, and, undefiled, master, to, whom, behavior, and, utterly, human, words, were, lent, so, that, one, is, even, tempted, to, see, there, the, memory, of, a, real, scene, which, nanda, reportedly, told, to, the, community, in, the, months, following, the, parinirv, a, the, same, text, contains, an, account, in, which, the, buddha, at, numerous, occasions, gave, a, hint, that, he, could, prolong, his, life, to, a, full, eon, through, a, supernatural, accomplishment, but, this, was, a, power, that, he, would, have, to, be, asked, to, exercise, nanda, was, distracted, however, and, did, not, take, the, hint, later, nanda, did, make, the, request, but, the, buddha, replied, that, it, was, already, too, late, as, he, would, die, soon, m, ra, the, buddhist, personification, of, evil, had, visited, the, buddha, and, the, buddha, had, decided, to, die, in, three, months, when, nanda, heard, this, he, wept, the, buddha, consoled, him, however, pointing, out, that, nanda, had, been, a, great, attendant, being, sensitive, to, the, needs, of, different, people, if, he, was, earnest, in, his, efforts, he, would, attain, enlightenment, soon, he, then, pointed, out, to, nanda, that, all, conditioned, things, are, impermanent, all, people, must, die, in, the, final, days, of, the, buddha, s, life, the, buddha, traveled, to, kusin, r, the, buddha, had, nanda, prepare, a, place, for, lying, down, between, two, sal, trees, the, same, type, of, tree, under, which, the, mother, of, the, buddha, gave, birth, the, buddha, then, had, nanda, invite, the, malla, clan, from, kusin, r, to, pay, their, final, respects, having, returned, nanda, asked, the, buddha, what, should, be, done, with, his, body, after, his, death, and, he, replied, that, it, should, be, cremated, giving, detailed, instructions, on, how, this, should, be, done, since, the, buddha, prohibited, nanda, from, being, involved, himself, but, rather, had, him, instruct, the, mallas, to, perform, the, rituals, these, instructions, have, by, many, scholars, been, interpreted, as, a, prohibition, that, monastics, should, not, be, involved, in, funerals, or, worship, of, st, pas, structures, with, relics, buddhist, studies, scholar, gregory, schopen, has, pointed, out, however, that, this, prohibition, only, held, for, nanda, and, only, with, regard, to, the, buddha, s, funeral, ceremony, it, has, also, been, shown, that, the, instructions, on, the, funeral, are, quite, late, in, origin, in, both, composition, and, insertion, into, the, text, and, are, not, found, in, parallel, texts, apart, from, the, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, nanda, then, continued, by, asking, how, devotees, should, honor, the, buddha, after, his, death, the, buddha, responded, by, listing, four, important, places, in, his, life, that, people, could, pay, their, respects, to, which, later, became, the, four, main, places, of, buddhist, pilgrimage, before, the, buddha, died, nanda, recommended, the, buddha, to, move, to, a, more, meaningful, city, instead, but, the, buddha, pointed, out, that, the, town, was, once, a, great, capital, nanda, then, asked, who, will, be, next, teacher, after, the, buddha, would, be, gone, but, the, buddha, replied, that, his, teaching, and, discipline, would, be, the, teacher, instead, this, meant, that, decisions, should, be, made, by, reaching, consensus, within, the, sa, gha, and, more, generally, that, now, the, time, had, come, for, the, buddhist, monastics, and, devotees, to, take, the, buddhist, texts, as, authority, now, that, the, buddha, was, dying, the, buddha, gave, several, instructions, before, his, death, including, a, directive, that, his, former, charioteer, channa, sanskrit, chandaka, be, shunned, by, his, fellow, monks, to, humble, his, pride, in, his, final, moments, the, buddha, asked, if, anyone, had, any, questions, they, wished, to, pose, to, him, as, a, final, chance, to, allay, any, doubts, when, no, one, responded, nanda, expressed, joy, that, all, of, the, buddha, s, disciples, present, had, attained, a, level, beyond, doubts, about, the, buddha, s, teaching, however, the, buddha, pointed, out, that, nanda, spoke, out, of, faith, and, not, out, of, meditative, insight, a, final, reproach, the, buddha, added, that, of, all, the, five, hundred, monks, that, are, surrounding, him, now, even, the, latest, or, most, backward, pali, pacchimaka, had, attained, the, initial, stage, of, sotapanna, meant, as, an, encouragement, the, buddha, was, referring, to, nanda, during, the, buddha, s, final, nirvana, anuruddha, was, able, to, use, his, meditative, powers, to, understand, which, stages, the, buddha, underwent, before, attaining, final, nirvana, however, nanda, was, unable, to, do, so, indicating, his, lesser, spiritual, maturity, after, the, buddha, s, death, nanda, recited, several, verses, expressing, a, sense, of, urgency, pali, sa, vega, deeply, moved, by, the, events, and, their, bearing, terrible, was, the, quaking, men, s, hair, stood, on, end, when, the, all, accomplished, buddha, passed, away, shortly, after, the, council, nanda, brought, the, message, with, regard, to, the, buddha, s, directive, to, channa, personally, channa, was, humbled, and, changed, his, ways, attained, enlightenment, and, the, penalty, was, withdrawn, by, the, sa, gha, nanda, traveled, to, s, vatth, sanskrit, r, vast, where, he, was, met, with, a, sad, populace, who, he, consoled, with, teachings, on, impermanence, after, that, nanda, went, to, the, quarters, of, the, buddha, and, went, through, the, motions, of, the, routine, he, formerly, performed, when, the, buddha, was, still, alive, such, as, preparing, water, and, cleaning, the, quarters, he, then, saluted, and, talked, to, the, quarters, as, though, the, buddha, was, still, there, the, p, li, commentaries, state, that, nanda, did, this, out, of, devotion, but, also, because, he, was, not, yet, free, from, the, passions, according, to, the, texts, the, first, buddhist, council, was, held, in, r, jagaha, in, the, first, vassa, after, the, buddha, had, died, the, presiding, monk, mah, kassapa, sanskrit, mah, k, yapa, called, upon, nanda, to, recite, the, discourses, he, had, heard, as, a, representative, on, this, council, there, was, a, rule, issued, that, only, enlightened, disciples, arahants, were, allowed, to, attend, the, council, to, prevent, mental, afflictions, from, clouding, the, disciples, memories, nanda, had, however, not, attained, enlightenment, yet, in, contrast, with, the, rest, of, the, council, consisting, of, 499, arahants, mah, kassapa, therefore, did, not, allow, nanda, to, attend, yet, although, he, knew, that, nanda, s, presence, in, the, council, was, required, he, did, not, want, to, be, biased, by, allowing, an, exception, to, the, rule, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, tradition, adds, that, mah, kassapa, initially, allowed, nanda, to, join, as, a, sort, of, servant, assisting, during, the, council, but, then, was, forced, to, remove, him, when, the, disciple, anuruddha, saw, that, nanda, was, not, yet, enlightened, nanda, felt, humiliated, but, was, prompted, to, focus, his, efforts, to, reach, enlightenment, before, the, council, started, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, add, that, he, felt, motivated, when, he, remembered, the, buddha, s, words, that, he, should, be, his, own, refuge, and, when, he, was, consoled, and, advised, by, anuruddha, and, vajjiputta, the, latter, being, his, attendant, on, the, night, before, the, event, he, tried, hard, to, attain, enlightenment, after, a, while, nanda, took, a, break, and, decided, to, lie, down, for, a, rest, he, then, attained, enlightenment, right, there, right, then, halfway, between, standing, and, lying, down, thus, nanda, was, known, as, the, disciple, who, attained, awakening, in, none, of, the, four, traditional, poses, walking, standing, sitting, or, lying, down, the, next, morning, to, prove, his, enlightenment, nanda, performed, a, supernatural, accomplishment, by, diving, into, the, earth, and, appearing, on, his, seat, at, the, council, or, according, to, some, sources, by, flying, through, the, air, scholars, such, as, buddhologist, andr, bareau, and, scholar, of, religion, ellison, banks, findly, have, been, skeptical, about, many, details, in, this, account, including, the, number, of, participants, on, the, council, and, the, account, of, nanda, s, enlightenment, just, before, the, council, regardless, today, the, story, of, nanda, s, struggle, on, the, evening, before, the, council, is, still, told, among, buddhists, as, a, piece, of, advice, in, the, practice, of, meditation, neither, to, give, up, nor, to, interpret, the, practice, too, rigidly, the, first, council, began, when, nanda, was, consulted, to, recite, the, discourses, and, to, determine, which, were, authentic, and, which, were, not, mah, kassapa, asked, of, each, discourse, that, nanda, listed, where, when, and, to, whom, it, was, given, and, at, the, end, of, this, the, assembly, agreed, that, nanda, s, memories, and, recitations, were, correct, after, which, the, discourse, collection, pali, sutta, pi, aka, sanskrit, s, tra, pi, aka, was, considered, finalized, and, closed, nanda, therefore, played, a, crucial, role, in, this, council, and, texts, claim, he, remembered, 84, 000, teaching, topics, among, which, 82, 000, taught, by, the, buddha, and, another, 2, 000, taught, by, disciples, many, early, buddhist, discourses, started, with, the, words, thus, have, i, heard, pali, eva, me, suta, sanskrit, eva, may, rutam, which, according, to, most, buddhist, traditions, were, nanda, s, words, indicating, that, he, as, the, person, reporting, the, text, sanskrit, sa, g, tik, ra, had, first, hand, experience, and, did, not, add, anything, to, it, thus, the, discourses, nanda, remembered, later, became, the, collection, of, discourses, of, the, canon, and, according, to, the, haimav, ta, dharmaguptaka, and, sarv, stiv, da, textual, traditions, and, implicitly, post, canonical, p, li, chronicles, the, collection, of, abhidhamma, abhidhamma, pi, aka, as, well, scholar, of, religion, ronald, davidson, notes, however, that, this, is, not, preceded, by, any, account, of, nanda, learning, abhidhamma, according, to, some, later, mah, y, na, accounts, nanda, also, assisted, in, reciting, mah, y, na, texts, held, in, a, different, place, in, r, jagaha, but, in, the, same, time, period, the, p, li, commentaries, state, that, after, the, council, when, the, tasks, for, recitation, and, memorizing, the, texts, were, divided, nanda, and, his, pupils, were, given, the, task, to, remember, the, d, gha, nik, ya, during, the, same, council, nanda, was, charged, for, an, offense, by, members, of, the, sa, gha, for, having, enabled, women, to, join, the, monastic, order, besides, this, he, was, charged, for, having, forgotten, to, request, the, buddha, to, specify, which, offenses, of, monastic, discipline, could, be, disregarded, for, having, stepped, on, the, buddha, s, robe, for, having, allowed, women, to, honor, the, buddha, s, body, after, his, death, which, was, not, properly, dressed, and, during, which, his, body, was, sullied, by, their, tears, and, for, having, failed, to, ask, the, buddha, to, continue, to, live, on, nanda, did, not, acknowledge, these, as, offenses, but, he, conceded, to, do, a, formal, confession, anyway, in, faith, of, the, opinion, of, the, venerable, elder, monks, nanda, wanted, to, prevent, disruption, in, the, sa, gha, with, regard, to, having, women, ordained, nanda, answered, that, he, had, done, this, with, great, effort, because, mah, paj, pati, was, the, buddha, s, foster, mother, who, had, long, provided, for, him, with, regard, to, not, requesting, the, buddha, to, continue, to, live, many, textual, traditions, have, nanda, respond, by, saying, he, was, distracted, by, m, ra, though, one, early, chinese, text, has, nanda, reply, he, did, not, request, the, buddha, to, prolong, his, life, for, fear, that, this, would, interfere, with, the, next, buddha, maitreya, s, ministry, according, to, the, p, li, tradition, the, charges, were, laid, after, nanda, had, become, enlightened, and, done, all, the, recitations, but, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, tradition, has, it, that, the, charges, were, laid, before, nanda, became, enlightened, and, started, the, recitations, in, this, version, when, nanda, heard, that, he, was, banned, from, the, council, he, objected, that, he, had, not, done, anything, that, went, against, the, teaching, and, discipline, of, the, buddha, mah, kassapa, then, listed, seven, charges, to, counter, nanda, s, objection, the, charges, were, similar, to, the, five, given, in, p, li, other, textual, traditions, list, slightly, different, charges, amounting, to, a, combined, total, of, eleven, charges, some, of, which, are, only, mentioned, in, one, or, two, textual, traditions, considering, that, an, enlightened, disciple, was, seen, to, have, overcome, all, faults, it, seems, more, likely, that, the, charges, were, laid, before, nanda, s, attainment, than, after, indologists, von, hin, ber, and, jean, przyluski, argue, that, the, account, of, nanda, being, charged, with, offenses, during, the, council, indicate, tensions, between, competing, early, buddhist, schools, i, e, schools, that, emphasized, the, discourses, pali, sutta, sanskrit, s, tra, and, schools, that, emphasized, monastic, discipline, these, differences, have, affected, the, scriptures, of, each, tradition, e, g, the, p, li, and, mah, saka, textual, traditions, portray, a, mah, kassapa, that, is, more, critical, of, nanda, than, that, the, sarv, stiv, da, tradition, depicts, him, reflecting, a, preference, for, discipline, above, discourse, on, the, part, of, the, former, traditions, and, a, preference, for, discourse, for, the, latter, another, example, is, the, recitations, during, the, first, council, the, p, li, texts, state, that, up, li, the, person, who, was, responsible, for, the, recitation, of, the, monastic, discipline, recited, before, nanda, does, again, monastic, discipline, above, discourse, analyzing, six, recensions, of, different, textual, traditions, of, the, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, extensively, bareau, distinguished, two, layers, in, the, text, an, older, and, a, newer, one, the, former, belonging, to, the, compilers, that, emphasized, discourse, the, latter, to, the, ones, that, emphasized, discipline, the, former, emphasizing, the, figure, of, nanda, the, latter, mah, kassapa, he, further, argued, that, the, passage, on, m, ra, obstructing, the, buddha, was, inserted, in, the, fourth, century, bce, and, that, nanda, was, blamed, for, m, ra, s, doing, by, inserting, the, passage, of, nanda, s, forgetfulness, in, the, third, century, bce, the, passage, in, which, the, buddha, was, ill, and, reminded, nanda, to, be, his, own, refuge, on, the, other, hand, bareau, regarded, as, very, ancient, pre, dating, the, passages, blaming, m, ra, and, nanda, in, conclusion, bareau, przyluski, and, horner, argued, that, the, offenses, nanda, were, charged, with, were, a, later, interpolation, findly, disagrees, however, because, the, account, in, the, texts, of, monastic, discipline, fits, in, with, the, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, and, with, nanda, s, character, as, generally, depicted, in, the, texts, tradition, states, that, the, first, council, lasted, for, seven, months, scholars, doubt, however, whether, the, entire, canon, was, really, recited, during, the, first, council, because, the, early, texts, contain, different, accounts, on, important, subjects, such, as, meditation, it, may, be, though, that, early, versions, were, recited, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, vinaya, pi, aka, and, sutta, pi, aka, nevertheless, many, scholars, from, the, late, 19th, century, onward, have, considered, the, historicity, of, the, first, council, improbable, some, scholars, such, as, orientalists, louis, de, la, vall, e, poussin, and, d, p, minayeff, thought, there, must, have, been, assemblies, after, the, buddha, s, death, but, considered, only, the, main, characters, and, some, events, before, or, after, the, first, council, historical, other, scholars, such, as, bareau, and, indologist, hermann, oldenberg, considered, it, likely, that, the, account, of, the, first, council, was, written, after, the, second, council, and, based, on, that, of, the, second, since, there, were, not, any, major, problems, to, solve, after, the, buddha, s, death, or, any, other, need, to, organize, the, first, council, much, material, in, the, accounts, and, even, more, so, in, the, more, developed, later, accounts, deal, with, nanda, as, the, unsullied, intermediary, who, passes, on, the, legitimate, teaching, of, the, buddha, on, the, other, hand, archaeologist, louis, finot, indologist, e, e, obermiller, and, to, some, extent, indologist, nalinaksha, dutt, thought, the, account, of, the, first, council, was, authentic, because, of, the, correspondences, between, the, p, li, texts, and, the, sanskrit, traditions, indologist, richard, gombrich, following, bhikkhu, sujato, and, bhikkhu, brahmali, s, arguments, states, that, it, makes, good, sense, to, believe, that, large, parts, of, the, pali, canon, do, preserve, for, us, the, buddha, vacana, the, buddha, s, words, transmitted, to, us, via, his, disciple, nanda, and, the, first, council, he, served, the, buddha, following, him, everywhere, like, a, shadow, bringing, him, tooth, wood, and, water, washing, his, feet, rubbing, his, body, cleaning, his, cell, and, fulfilling, all, his, duties, with, the, greatest, care, by, day, he, was, at, hand, forestalling, the, slightest, wish, of, the, buddha, at, night, staff, and, torch, in, hand, he, went, nine, times, round, the, buddha, s, cell, and, never, put, them, down, lest, he, would, fall, asleep, and, fail, to, answer, a, call, to, the, buddha, transl, by, ellison, banks, findly, manorathap, ran, nanda, was, recognized, as, one, of, the, most, important, disciples, of, the, buddha, in, the, lists, of, the, disciples, given, in, the, a, guttara, nik, ya, and, sa, yutta, nik, ya, each, of, the, disciples, is, declared, to, be, foremost, in, some, quality, nanda, is, mentioned, more, often, than, any, other, disciple, he, is, named, foremost, in, conduct, in, attention, to, others, in, power, of, memory, in, erudition, and, in, resoluteness, nanda, was, the, subject, of, a, sermon, of, praise, delivered, by, the, buddha, just, before, the, buddha, s, death, as, described, in, the, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, it, is, a, sermon, about, a, man, who, is, kindly, unselfish, popular, and, thoughtful, toward, others, in, the, texts, he, is, depicted, as, compassionate, in, his, relations, with, lay, people, a, compassion, he, learnt, from, the, buddha, the, buddha, relays, that, both, monastics, and, lay, people, were, pleased, to, see, nanda, and, were, pleased, to, hear, him, recite, and, teach, the, buddha, s, teaching, moreover, nanda, was, known, for, his, organizational, skills, assisting, the, buddha, with, secretary, like, duties, in, many, ways, nanda, did, not, only, serve, the, personal, needs, of, the, buddha, but, also, the, needs, of, the, still, young, growing, institute, of, the, sa, gha, moreover, because, of, his, ability, to, remember, the, many, teachings, of, the, buddha, he, is, described, as, foremost, in, having, heard, much, pali, bahussuta, sanskrit, bahu, ruta, pinyin, duowen, diyi, nanda, was, known, for, his, exceptional, memory, which, is, essential, in, helping, him, to, remember, the, buddha, s, teachings, he, also, taught, other, disciples, to, memorize, buddhist, doctrine, for, these, reasons, nanda, became, known, as, the, treasurer, of, the, dhamma, pali, dhamma, bha, g, rika, sanskrit, dharma, bha, g, rika, dhamma, sanskrit, dharma, referring, to, the, doctrine, of, the, buddha, being, the, person, who, had, accompanied, the, buddha, throughout, a, great, part, of, his, life, nanda, was, in, many, ways, the, living, memory, of, the, buddha, without, which, the, sa, gha, would, be, much, worse, off, besides, his, memory, skills, nanda, also, stood, out, in, that, as, the, buddha, s, cousin, he, dared, to, ask, the, buddha, direct, questions, for, example, after, the, death, of, mah, vira, and, the, depicted, subsequent, conflicts, among, the, jain, community, nanda, asked, the, buddha, how, such, problems, could, be, prevented, after, the, buddha, s, death, however, findly, argues, that, nanda, s, duty, to, memorize, the, buddha, s, teachings, accurately, and, without, distortion, was, both, a, gift, and, a, burden, nanda, was, able, to, remember, many, discourses, verbatim, but, this, also, went, hand, in, hand, with, a, habit, of, not, reflecting, on, those, teachings, being, afraid, that, reflection, might, distort, the, teachings, as, he, heard, them, at, multiple, occasions, nanda, was, warned, by, other, disciples, that, he, should, spend, less, time, on, conversing, to, lay, people, and, more, time, on, his, own, practice, even, though, nanda, regularly, practiced, meditation, for, long, hours, he, was, less, experienced, in, meditative, concentration, than, other, leading, disciples, thus, judgment, of, nanda, s, character, depends, on, whether, one, judges, his, accomplishments, as, a, monk, or, his, accomplishments, as, an, attendant, and, person, memorizing, the, discourses, from, a, literary, and, didactic, point, of, view, nanda, often, functioned, as, a, kind, of, foil, in, the, texts, being, an, unenlightened, disciple, attending, to, an, enlightened, buddha, because, the, run, of, the, mill, person, could, identify, with, nanda, the, buddha, could, through, nanda, convey, his, teachings, to, the, mass, easily, nanda, s, character, was, in, many, ways, a, contradiction, to, that, of, the, buddha, being, unenlightened, and, someone, who, made, mistakes, at, the, same, time, however, he, was, completely, devoted, to, service, to, the, buddha, the, buddha, is, depicted, in, the, early, texts, as, both, a, father, and, a, teacher, to, nanda, stern, but, compassionate, nanda, was, very, fond, of, and, attached, to, the, buddha, willing, to, give, his, life, for, him, he, mourned, the, deaths, of, both, the, buddha, and, s, riputta, with, whom, he, enjoyed, a, close, friendship, in, both, cases, nanda, was, very, shocked, nanda, s, faith, in, the, buddha, however, constituted, more, of, a, faith, in, a, person, especially, the, buddha, s, person, as, opposed, to, faith, in, the, buddha, s, teaching, this, is, a, pattern, which, comes, back, in, the, accounts, which, lead, to, the, offenses, nanda, was, charged, with, during, the, first, council, moreover, nanda, s, weaknesses, described, in, the, texts, were, that, he, was, sometimes, slow, witted, and, lacked, mindfulness, which, became, noticeable, because, of, his, role, as, attendant, to, the, buddha, this, involved, minor, matters, like, deportment, but, also, more, important, matters, such, as, ordaining, a, man, with, no, future, as, a, pupil, or, disturbing, the, buddha, at, the, wrong, time, for, example, one, time, mah, kassapa, chastised, nanda, in, strong, words, criticizing, the, fact, that, nanda, was, travelling, with, a, large, following, of, young, monks, who, appeared, untrained, and, who, had, built, up, a, bad, reputation, in, another, episode, described, in, a, sarv, stiv, da, text, nanda, is, the, only, disciple, who, was, willing, to, teach, psychic, powers, to, devadatta, who, later, would, use, these, in, an, attempt, to, destroy, the, buddha, according, to, a, mah, saka, text, however, when, devadatta, had, turned, against, the, buddha, nanda, was, not, persuaded, by, him, and, voted, against, him, in, a, formal, meeting, nanda, s, late, spiritual, growth, is, much, discussed, in, buddhist, texts, and, the, general, conclusion, is, that, nanda, was, slower, than, other, disciples, due, to, his, worldly, attachments, and, his, attachment, to, the, person, of, the, buddha, both, of, which, were, rooted, in, his, mediating, work, between, the, buddha, and, the, lay, communities, after, the, buddha, s, death, some, sources, say, nanda, stayed, mostly, in, the, west, of, india, in, the, area, of, kosamb, sanskrit, kausamb, where, he, taught, most, of, his, pupils, other, sources, say, he, stayed, in, the, monastery, at, ve, uvana, sanskrit, ve, uvana, several, pupils, of, nanda, became, well, known, in, their, own, right, according, to, post, canonical, sanskrit, sources, such, as, the, divyavad, na, and, the, a, okavad, na, before, the, buddha, s, death, the, buddha, confided, to, nanda, that, the, latter, s, student, majjhantika, sanskrit, madhy, ntika, would, travel, to, udy, na, kashmir, to, bring, the, teaching, of, the, buddha, there, mah, kassapa, made, a, prediction, that, later, would, come, true, that, another, of, nanda, s, future, pupils, s, av, s, sanskrit, akav, s, akav, sin, or, vasika, would, make, many, gifts, to, the, sa, gha, at, mathur, during, a, feast, held, from, profits, of, successful, business, after, this, event, nanda, would, successfully, persuade, s, av, s, to, become, ordained, and, be, his, pupil, nanda, later, persuaded, s, av, s, by, pointing, out, that, the, latter, had, now, made, many, material, gifts, but, had, not, given, the, gift, of, the, dhamma, when, asked, for, explanation, nanda, replied, that, s, av, s, would, give, the, gift, of, dhamma, by, becoming, ordained, as, a, monk, which, was, reason, enough, for, s, av, s, to, make, the, decision, to, get, ordained, though, no, early, buddhist, text, provides, a, date, for, nanda, s, death, according, to, the, chinese, pilgrim, monk, faxian, 337, 422, ce, nanda, went, on, to, live, 120, years, following, the, later, timeline, however, nanda, may, have, lived, to, 75, 85, years, buddhist, studies, scholar, l, s, cousins, dated, nanda, s, death, twenty, years, after, the, buddha, s, nanda, was, teaching, till, the, end, of, his, life, according, to, m, lasarv, stiv, da, sources, nanda, heard, a, young, monk, recite, a, verse, incorrectly, and, advised, him, when, the, monk, reported, this, to, his, teacher, the, latter, objected, that, nanda, has, grown, old, and, his, memory, is, impaired, this, prompted, nanda, to, attain, final, nirvana, he, passed, on, the, custody, of, the, doctrine, to, his, pupil, s, av, s, and, left, for, the, river, ganges, however, according, to, p, li, sources, when, nanda, was, about, to, die, he, decided, to, spend, his, final, moments, in, ves, l, instead, and, traveled, to, the, river, roh, ni, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, version, expands, and, says, that, before, reaching, the, river, he, met, with, a, seer, called, majjhantika, following, the, prediction, earlier, and, five, hundred, of, his, followers, who, converted, to, buddhism, some, sources, add, that, nanda, passed, the, buddha, s, message, on, to, him, when, nanda, was, crossing, the, river, he, was, followed, by, king, aj, tasattu, sanskrit, aj, ta, atr, who, wanted, to, witness, his, death, and, was, interested, in, his, remains, as, relics, nanda, had, once, promised, aj, sattu, that, he, would, let, him, know, when, he, would, die, and, accordingly, nanda, had, informed, him, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, however, a, group, of, licchavis, from, ves, l, awaited, him, for, the, same, reason, in, the, p, li, there, were, also, two, parties, interested, but, the, two, parties, were, the, s, kiyan, and, the, koliyan, clans, instead, nanda, realized, that, his, death, on, either, side, of, the, river, could, anger, one, of, the, parties, involved, through, a, supernatural, accomplishment, he, therefore, surged, into, the, air, to, levitate, and, meditate, in, mid, air, making, his, body, go, up, in, fire, with, his, relics, landing, on, both, banks, of, the, river, or, in, some, versions, of, the, account, splitting, in, four, parts, in, this, way, nanda, had, pleased, all, the, parties, involved, in, some, other, versions, of, the, account, including, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, version, his, death, took, place, on, a, barge, in, the, middle, of, the, river, however, instead, of, in, mid, air, the, remains, were, divided, in, two, following, the, wishes, of, nanda, majjhantika, later, successfully, carried, out, the, mission, following, the, buddha, s, prediction, the, latter, s, pupil, upagupta, was, described, to, be, the, teacher, of, king, a, oka, 3rd, century, bce, together, with, four, or, five, other, pupils, of, nanda, s, av, s, and, majjhantika, formed, the, majority, of, the, second, council, with, majjhantika, being, nanda, s, last, pupil, post, canonical, p, li, sources, add, that, s, av, s, had, a, leading, role, in, the, third, buddhist, council, as, well, although, little, is, historically, certain, cousins, thought, it, likely, at, least, one, of, the, leading, figures, on, the, second, council, was, a, pupil, of, nanda, as, nearly, all, the, textual, traditions, mention, a, connection, with, nanda, aj, sattu, is, said, to, have, built, a, st, pa, on, top, of, the, nanda, s, relics, at, the, river, roh, ni, or, according, to, some, sources, the, ganges, the, licchavis, had, also, built, a, st, pa, at, their, side, of, the, river, the, chinese, pilgrim, xuan, zang, 602, 64, ce, later, visited, st, pas, on, both, sides, of, the, river, roh, ni, faxian, also, reported, having, visited, st, pas, dedicated, to, nanda, at, the, river, roh, ni, but, also, in, mathur, moreover, according, to, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, version, of, the, sa, yukta, gama, king, a, oka, visited, and, made, the, most, lavish, offerings, he, ever, made, to, a, st, pa, who, in, the, norm, is, widely, versed, transl, by, c, a, f, rhys, davids, therag, th, he, explained, to, his, ministers, that, he, did, this, because, he, body, of, the, tath, gata, is, the, body, of, dharma, s, pure, in, nature, he, was, able, to, retain, it, them, all, for, this, reason, the, offerings, surpass, body, of, dharma, here, referred, to, the, buddha, s, teachings, as, a, whole, in, early, buddhist, texts, nanda, had, reached, final, nirvana, and, would, no, longer, be, reborn, but, in, contrast, with, the, early, texts, according, to, the, mah, y, na, lotus, s, tra, nanda, would, be, born, as, a, buddha, in, the, future, he, would, accomplish, this, slower, than, the, present, buddha, gotama, buddha, had, accomplished, this, because, nanda, aspired, to, becoming, a, buddha, by, applying, great, learning, because, of, this, long, trajectory, and, great, efforts, however, his, enlightenment, would, be, extraordinary, and, with, great, splendor, nanda, is, depicted, as, an, eloquent, speaker, who, often, taught, about, the, self, and, about, meditation, there, are, numerous, buddhist, texts, attributed, to, nanda, including, the, atthakan, gara, sutta, about, meditation, methods, to, attain, nirvana, a, version, of, the, bhaddekaratta, sutta, sanskrit, bhadrak, r, tr, pinyin, shanye, about, living, in, the, present, moment, the, sekha, sutta, about, the, higher, training, of, a, disciple, of, the, buddha, the, subha, suttanta, about, the, practices, the, buddha, inspired, others, to, follow, in, the, gopaka, mogall, nasutta, a, conversation, took, place, between, nanda, the, brahmin, gopaka, mogall, na, and, the, minister, vassakara, the, latter, being, the, highest, official, of, the, magadha, region, during, this, conversation, which, occurred, shortly, after, the, buddha, s, death, vassakara, asked, whether, it, was, decided, yet, who, would, succeed, the, buddha, nanda, replied, that, no, such, successor, had, been, appointed, but, that, the, buddhist, community, took, the, buddha, s, teaching, and, discipline, as, a, refuge, instead, furthermore, the, sa, gha, did, not, have, the, buddha, as, a, master, anymore, but, they, would, honor, those, monks, who, were, virtuous, and, trustworthy, besides, these, suttas, a, section, of, the, therag, th, is, attributed, to, nanda, even, in, the, texts, attributed, to, the, buddha, himself, nanda, is, sometimes, depicted, giving, a, name, to, a, particular, text, or, suggesting, a, simile, to, the, buddha, to, use, in, his, teachings, in, east, asian, buddhism, nanda, is, considered, one, of, the, ten, principal, disciples, in, many, indian, sanskrit, and, east, asian, texts, nanda, is, considered, the, second, patriarch, of, the, lineage, which, transmitted, the, teaching, of, the, buddha, with, mah, kassapa, being, the, first, and, majjhantika, or, sa, av, s, being, the, third, there, is, an, account, dating, back, from, the, sarv, stiv, da, and, m, lasarv, stiv, da, textual, traditions, which, states, that, before, mah, kassapa, died, he, bestowed, the, buddha, s, teaching, on, nanda, as, a, formal, passing, on, of, authority, telling, nanda, to, pass, the, teaching, on, to, nanda, s, pupil, sa, av, s, later, just, before, nanda, died, he, did, as, mah, kassapa, had, told, him, to, buddhist, studies, scholars, akira, hirakawa, and, bibhuti, baruah, have, expressed, skepticism, about, the, teacher, student, relationship, between, mah, kassapa, and, nanda, arguing, that, there, was, discord, between, the, two, as, indicated, in, the, early, texts, regardless, it, is, clear, from, the, texts, that, a, relationship, of, transmission, of, teachings, is, meant, as, opposed, to, an, upajjh, ya, student, relationship, in, a, lineage, of, ordination, no, source, indicates, mah, kassapa, was, nanda, s, upajjh, ya, in, mah, y, na, iconography, nanda, is, often, depicted, flanking, the, buddha, at, the, right, side, together, with, mah, kassapa, at, the, left, in, therav, da, iconography, however, nanda, is, usually, not, depicted, in, this, manner, and, the, motif, of, transmission, of, the, dhamma, through, a, list, of, patriarchs, is, not, found, in, p, li, sources, because, nanda, was, instrumental, in, founding, the, bhikkhun, community, he, has, been, honored, by, bhikkhun, s, for, this, throughout, buddhist, history, the, earliest, traces, of, this, can, be, found, in, the, writings, of, faxian, and, xuan, zang, who, reported, that, bhikkhun, s, made, offerings, to, a, st, pa, in, nanda, s, honor, during, celebrations, and, observance, days, on, a, similar, note, in, 5th, 6th, century, china, and, 10th, century, japan, buddhist, texts, were, composed, recommending, women, to, uphold, the, semi, monastic, eight, precepts, in, honor, and, gratitude, of, nanda, in, japan, this, was, done, through, the, format, of, a, penance, ritual, called, keka, chinese, by, the, 13th, century, in, japan, a, cult, like, interest, for, nanda, had, developed, in, a, number, of, convents, in, which, images, and, st, pas, were, used, and, ceremonies, were, held, in, his, honor, presently, opinion, among, scholars, is, divided, as, to, whether, nanda, s, cult, among, bhikkhun, s, was, an, expression, of, their, dependence, on, male, monastic, tradition, or, the, opposite, an, expression, of, their, legitimacy, and, independence, p, li, vinaya, texts, attribute, the, design, of, the, buddhist, monk, s, robe, to, nanda, as, buddhism, prospered, more, laypeople, started, to, donate, expensive, cloth, for, robes, which, put, the, monks, at, risk, for, theft, to, decrease, its, commercial, value, monks, therefore, cut, up, the, cloth, offered, before, they, sew, a, robe, from, it, the, buddha, asked, nanda, to, think, of, a, model, for, a, buddhist, robe, made, from, small, pieces, of, cloth, nanda, designed, a, standard, robe, model, based, on, the, rice, fields, of, magadha, which, were, divided, in, sections, by, banks, of, earth, another, tradition, that, is, connected, to, nanda, is, paritta, recitation, therav, da, buddhists, explain, that, the, custom, of, sprinkling, water, during, paritta, chanting, originates, in, nanda, s, visit, to, ves, l, when, he, recited, the, ratana, sutta, and, sprinkled, water, from, his, alms, bowl, a, third, tradition, sometimes, attributed, to, nanda, is, the, use, of, bodhi, trees, in, buddhism, it, is, described, in, the, text, k, li, gabodhi, j, taka, that, nanda, planted, a, bodhi, tree, as, a, symbol, of, the, buddha, s, enlightenment, to, give, people, the, chance, to, pay, their, respects, to, the, buddha, this, tree, and, shrine, came, to, be, known, as, the, nanda, bodhi, tree, said, to, have, grown, from, a, seed, from, the, original, bodhi, tree, under, which, the, buddha, is, depicted, to, have, attained, enlightenment, many, of, this, type, of, bodhi, tree, shrines, in, southeast, asia, were, erected, following, this, example, presently, the, nanda, bodhi, tree, is, sometimes, identified, with, a, tree, at, the, ruins, of, jetavana, s, vatthi, based, on, the, records, of, faxian, between, 1856, and, 1858, richard, wagner, wrote, a, draft, for, an, opera, libretto, based, on, the, legend, about, nanda, and, the, low, caste, girl, prak, ti, he, left, only, a, fragmentary, prose, sketch, of, a, work, to, be, called, die, sieger, but, the, topic, inspired, his, later, opera, parsifal, furthermore, the, draft, was, used, by, composer, jonathan, harvey, in, his, 2007, opera, wagner, dream, in, wagner, s, version, of, the, legend, which, he, based, on, orientalist, eug, ne, burnouf, s, translations, the, magical, spell, of, prak, ti, s, mother, does, not, work, on, nanda, and, prak, ti, turns, to, the, buddha, to, explain, her, desires, for, nanda, the, buddha, replies, that, a, union, between, prak, ti, and, nanda, is, possible, but, prak, ti, must, agree, to, the, buddha, s, conditions, prak, ti, agrees, and, it, is, revealed, that, the, buddha, means, something, else, than, she, does, he, asks, prak, ti, to, ordain, as, a, bhikkhun, and, live, the, celibate, life, as, a, kind, of, sister, to, nanda, at, first, prak, ti, weeps, in, dismay, but, after, the, buddha, explains, that, her, current, situation, is, a, result, of, karma, from, her, previous, life, she, understands, and, rejoices, in, the, life, of, a, bhikkhun, apart, from, the, spiritual, themes, wagner, also, addresses, the, faults, of, the, caste, system, by, having, the, buddha, criticize, it, drawing, from, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, wagner, contrasts, desire, driven, salvation, and, true, spiritual, salvation, by, seeking, deliverance, through, the, person, she, loves, prak, ti, only, affirms, her, will, to, live, german, wille, zum, leben, which, is, blocking, her, from, attaining, deliverance, by, being, ordained, as, a, bhikkhun, she, strives, for, her, spiritual, salvation, instead, thus, the, early, buddhist, account, of, mah, paj, pati, s, ordination, is, replaced, by, that, of, prak, ti, according, to, wagner, by, allowing, prak, ti, to, become, ordained, the, buddha, also, completes, his, own, aim, in, life, e, regards, his, existence, in, the, world, whose, aim, was, to, benefit, all, beings, as, completed, since, he, had, become, able, to, offer, deliverance, without, mediation, also, to, woman, the, same, legend, of, nanda, and, prak, ti, was, made, into, a, short, prose, play, by, the, indian, poet, rabindranath, tagore, called, chandalika, chandalika, deals, with, the, themes, of, spiritual, conflict, caste, and, social, equality, and, contains, a, strong, critique, of, indian, society, just, like, in, the, traditional, account, prak, ti, falls, in, love, with, nanda, after, he, gives, her, self, esteem, by, accepting, a, gift, of, water, from, her, prak, ti, s, mother, casts, a, spell, to, enchant, nanda, in, tagore, s, play, however, prak, ti, later, regrets, what, she, has, done, and, has, the, spell, revoked
