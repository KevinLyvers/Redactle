family, and, affected, the, brothers, many, years, after, both, brothers, attended, the, university, of, marburg, where, they, developed, a, curiosity, about, german, folklore, which, grew, into, a, lifelong, dedication, to, collecting, german, folktales, the, rise, of, romanticism, in, 19th, century, europe, revived, interest, in, traditional, folk, stories, which, to, the, brothers, grimm, represented, a, pure, form, of, national, literature, and, culture, with, the, goal, of, researching, a, scholarly, treatise, on, folktales, they, established, a, methodology, for, collecting, and, recording, folk, stories, that, became, the, basis, for, folklore, studies, between, 1812, and, 1857, their, first, collection, was, revised, and, republished, many, times, growing, from, 86, stories, to, more, than, 200, in, addition, to, writing, and, modifying, folktales, the, brothers, wrote, collections, of, well, respected, germanic, and, scandinavian, mythologies, and, in, 1838, they, began, writing, a, definitive, german, dictionary, deutsches, w, rterbuch, which, they, were, unable, to, finish, the, popularity, of, the, grimms, collected, folktales, has, endured, they, are, available, in, more, than, 100, translations, and, have, been, adapted, by, renowned, filmmakers, including, lotte, reiniger, and, walt, disney, in, films, such, as, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, in, the, mid, 20th, century, nazi, germany, used, the, tales, as, propaganda, later, in, the, 20th, century, psychologists, such, as, bruno, bettelheim, reaffirmed, the, work, s, value, despite, the, cruelty, and, violence, in, some, of, the, tales, original, versions, which, were, eventually, sanitized, by, the, grimms, themselves, jacob, ludwig, karl, grimm, and, wilhelm, carl, grimm, were, born, on, 4, january, 1785, and, 24, february, 1786, respectively, in, hanau, in, the, landgraviate, of, hesse, kassel, within, the, holy, roman, empire, present, day, germany, to, philipp, wilhelm, grimm, a, jurist, and, dorothea, grimm, n, e, zimmer, daughter, of, a, kassel, city, councilman, they, were, the, second, and, third, eldest, surviving, siblings, in, a, family, of, nine, children, three, of, whom, died, in, infancy, in, 1791, the, family, moved, to, the, countryside, town, of, steinau, during, philipp, s, employment, there, as, a, district, magistrate, amtmann, the, family, became, prominent, members, of, the, community, residing, in, a, large, home, surrounded, by, fields, biographer, jack, zipes, writes, that, the, brothers, were, happy, in, steinau, and, clearly, fond, of, country, life, the, children, were, educated, at, home, by, private, tutors, receiving, strict, instruction, as, lutherans, which, instilled, in, both, a, lifelong, religious, faith, later, they, attended, local, schools, in, 1796, philipp, grimm, died, of, pneumonia, causing, great, poverty, for, the, large, family, dorothea, was, forced, to, relinquish, the, brothers, servants, and, large, house, depending, on, financial, support, from, her, father, and, sister, who, was, then, the, first, lady, in, waiting, at, the, court, of, william, i, elector, of, hesse, jacob, was, the, eldest, living, son, forced, at, age, 11, to, assume, adult, responsibilities, shared, with, wilhelm, for, the, next, two, years, the, two, brothers, then, followed, the, advice, of, their, grandfather, who, continually, exhorted, them, to, be, industrious, the, brothers, left, steinau, and, their, family, in, 1798, to, attend, the, friedrichsgymnasium, in, kassel, which, had, been, arranged, and, paid, for, by, their, aunt, by, then, they, were, without, a, male, provider, their, grandfather, died, that, year, forcing, them, to, rely, entirely, on, each, other, and, become, exceptionally, close, the, two, brothers, differed, in, temperament, jacob, was, introspective, and, wilhelm, was, outgoing, although, he, often, suffered, from, ill, health, but, shared, a, strong, work, ethic, and, excelled, in, their, studies, in, kassel, they, became, acutely, aware, of, their, inferior, social, status, relative, to, high, born, students, who, received, more, attention, each, brother, graduated, at, the, head, of, his, class, jacob, in, 1803, and, wilhelm, in, 1804, he, missed, a, year, of, school, due, to, scarlet, fever, after, graduation, from, the, friedrichsgymnasium, the, brothers, attended, the, university, of, marburg, the, university, was, small, with, about, 200, students, and, there, they, became, painfully, aware, that, students, of, lower, social, status, were, not, treated, equally, they, were, disqualified, from, admission, because, of, their, social, standing, and, had, to, request, a, dispensation, to, study, law, wealthier, students, received, stipends, but, the, brothers, were, excluded, even, from, tuition, aid, their, poverty, kept, them, from, student, activities, or, university, social, life, but, their, outsider, status, worked, in, their, favor, and, they, pursued, their, studies, with, extra, vigor, inspired, by, their, law, professor, friedrich, von, savigny, who, awakened, in, them, an, interest, in, history, and, philology, the, brothers, studied, medieval, german, literature, they, shared, savigny, s, desire, to, see, the, unification, of, the, 200, german, principalities, into, a, single, state, through, savigny, and, his, circle, of, friends, german, romantics, such, as, clemens, brentano, and, ludwig, achim, von, arnim, the, grimms, were, introduced, to, the, ideas, of, johann, gottfried, herder, who, thought, that, german, literature, should, revert, to, simpler, forms, which, he, defined, as, volkspoesie, natural, poetry, as, opposed, to, kunstpoesie, artistic, poetry, the, brothers, dedicated, themselves, with, great, enthusiasm, to, their, studies, of, which, wilhelm, wrote, in, his, autobiography, the, ardor, with, which, we, studied, old, german, helped, us, overcome, the, spiritual, depression, of, those, days, jacob, was, still, financially, responsible, for, his, mother, brother, and, younger, siblings, in, 1805, so, he, accepted, a, post, in, paris, as, savigny, s, research, assistant, on, his, return, to, marburg, he, was, forced, to, abandon, his, studies, to, support, the, family, whose, poverty, was, so, extreme, that, food, was, often, scarce, and, take, a, job, with, the, hessian, war, commission, in, a, letter, to, his, aunt, from, this, time, wilhelm, wrote, of, their, circumstances, we, five, people, eat, only, three, portions, and, only, once, a, day, jacob, found, full, time, employment, in, 1808, when, he, was, appointed, court, librarian, to, the, king, of, westphalia, and, went, on, to, become, a, librarian, in, kassel, after, their, mother, s, death, that, year, he, became, fully, responsible, for, his, younger, siblings, he, arranged, and, paid, for, his, brother, ludwig, s, studies, at, art, school, and, for, wilhelm, s, extended, visit, to, halle, to, seek, treatment, for, heart, and, respiratory, ailments, after, which, wilhelm, joined, jacob, as, librarian, in, kassel, at, brentano, s, request, the, brothers, had, begun, collecting, folk, tales, in, a, cursory, manner, in, 1807, according, to, zipes, at, this, point, the, grimms, were, unable, to, devote, all, their, energies, to, their, research, and, did, not, have, a, clear, idea, about, the, significance, of, collecting, folk, tales, in, this, initial, phase, during, their, employment, as, librarians, which, paid, little, but, afforded, them, ample, time, for, research, the, brothers, experienced, a, productive, period, of, scholarship, publishing, books, between, 1812, and, 1830, in, 1812, they, published, their, first, volume, of, 86, folk, tales, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, followed, quickly, by, two, volumes, of, german, legends, and, a, volume, of, early, literary, history, they, went, on, to, publish, works, about, danish, and, irish, folk, tales, and, also, norse, mythology, while, continuing, to, edit, the, german, folk, tale, collection, these, works, became, so, widely, recognized, that, the, brothers, received, honorary, doctorates, from, universities, in, marburg, berlin, and, breslau, now, wroc, aw, on, 15, may, 1825, wilhelm, married, henriette, dorothea, dortchen, wild, a, pharmacist, s, daughter, and, childhood, friend, who, had, given, the, brothers, several, tales, jacob, never, married, but, continued, to, live, in, the, household, with, wilhelm, and, dortchen, in, 1830, both, brothers, were, overlooked, when, the, post, of, chief, librarian, came, available, which, disappointed, them, greatly, they, moved, the, household, to, g, ttingen, in, the, kingdom, of, hanover, where, they, took, employment, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, jacob, as, a, professor, and, head, librarian, and, wilhelm, as, a, professor, for, the, next, seven, years, the, brothers, continued, to, research, write, and, publish, in, 1835, jacob, published, the, well, regarded, german, mythology, deutsche, mythologie, wilhelm, continued, to, edit, and, prepare, the, third, edition, of, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, for, publication, the, two, brothers, taught, german, studies, at, the, university, becoming, well, respected, in, the, newly, established, discipline, in, 1837, the, brothers, lost, their, university, posts, after, joining, the, rest, of, the, g, ttingen, seven, in, protest, the, 1830s, were, a, period, of, political, upheaval, and, peasant, revolt, in, germany, leading, to, the, movement, for, democratic, reform, known, as, young, germany, the, brothers, were, not, directly, aligned, with, the, young, germans, but, they, and, five, of, their, colleagues, reacted, against, the, demands, of, ernest, augustus, king, of, hanover, who, in, 1837, dissolved, the, parliament, of, hanover, and, demanded, oaths, of, allegiance, from, civil, servants, including, professors, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, for, refusing, to, sign, the, oath, the, seven, professors, were, dismissed, and, three, were, deported, from, hanover, including, jacob, who, went, to, kassel, he, was, later, joined, there, by, wilhelm, dortchen, and, their, four, children, the, brothers, were, without, income, and, again, in, extreme, financial, difficulty, in, 1838, so, they, began, what, would, become, a, lifelong, project, the, writing, of, a, definitive, dictionary, the, german, dictionary, deutsches, w, rterbuch, whose, first, volume, was, not, published, until, 1854, the, brothers, again, depended, on, friends, and, supporters, for, financial, assistance, and, influence, in, finding, employment, in, 1840, savigny, and, bettina, von, arnim, appealed, successfully, to, frederick, william, iv, of, prussia, on, behalf, of, the, brothers, who, were, offered, posts, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, addition, to, teaching, posts, the, academy, of, sciences, offered, them, stipends, to, continue, their, research, once, they, had, established, their, household, in, berlin, they, directed, their, efforts, towards, the, work, on, the, german, dictionary, and, continued, to, publish, their, research, jacob, turned, his, attention, to, researching, german, legal, traditions, and, the, history, of, the, german, language, which, was, published, in, the, late, 1840s, and, early, 1850s, wilhelm, began, researching, medieval, literature, while, editing, new, editions, of, hausm, rchen, after, the, revolutions, of, 1848, in, the, german, states, the, brothers, were, elected, to, the, civil, parliament, jacob, became, a, prominent, member, of, the, national, assembly, at, mainz, but, their, political, activities, were, short, lived, as, their, hope, for, a, unified, germany, dwindled, and, their, disenchantment, grew, in, the, late, 1840s, jacob, resigned, his, university, position, and, published, the, history, of, the, german, language, geschichte, der, deutschen, sprache, wilhelm, continued, at, his, university, post, until, 1852, after, retiring, from, teaching, the, brothers, devoted, themselves, to, the, german, dictionary, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, wilhelm, died, of, an, infection, in, berlin, on, 16, december, 1859, and, jacob, deeply, upset, by, his, death, became, increasingly, reclusive, he, continued, working, on, the, dictionary, until, his, own, death, on, 20, september, 1863, zipes, writes, of, the, grimms, dictionary, and, of, their, very, large, body, of, work, symbolically, the, last, word, was, frucht, fruit, the, rise, of, romanticism, romantic, nationalism, and, trends, in, valuing, popular, culture, in, the, early, 19th, century, revived, interest, in, fairy, tales, which, had, declined, since, their, late, 17th, century, peak, johann, karl, august, mus, us, published, a, popular, collection, of, tales, called, volksm, rchen, der, deutschen, between, 1782, and, 1787, the, grimms, aided, the, revival, with, their, folklore, collection, built, on, the, conviction, that, a, national, identity, could, be, found, in, popular, culture, and, with, the, common, folk, volk, they, collected, and, published, their, tales, as, a, reflection, of, german, cultural, identity, in, the, first, collection, though, they, included, charles, perrault, s, tales, published, in, paris, in, 1697, and, written, for, the, literary, salons, of, an, aristocratic, french, audience, scholar, lydie, jean, says, that, perrault, created, a, myth, that, his, tales, came, from, the, common, people, and, reflected, existing, folklore, to, justify, including, them, even, though, many, of, them, were, original, the, brothers, were, directly, influenced, by, brentano, and, von, arnim, who, edited, and, adapted, the, folk, songs, of, des, knaben, wunderhorn, the, boy, s, magic, horn, or, cornucopia, they, began, the, collection, with, the, purpose, of, creating, a, scholarly, treatise, of, traditional, stories, and, of, preserving, the, stories, as, they, had, been, handed, from, generation, to, generation, a, practice, threatened, by, increased, industrialization, maria, tatar, professor, of, german, studies, at, harvard, university, argues, that, it, is, precisely, the, handing, from, generation, to, generation, and, the, genesis, in, the, oral, tradition, that, gives, folk, tales, important, mutability, versions, of, tales, differ, from, region, to, region, picking, up, bits, and, pieces, of, local, culture, and, lore, drawing, a, turn, of, phrase, from, a, song, or, another, story, and, fleshing, out, characters, with, features, taken, from, the, audience, witnessing, their, performance, but, tatar, argues, that, the, grimms, appropriated, as, uniquely, german, stories, such, as, little, red, riding, hood, that, had, existed, in, many, versions, and, regions, throughout, europe, because, they, believed, that, such, stories, reflected, germanic, culture, furthermore, the, brothers, saw, fragments, of, old, religions, and, faiths, reflected, in, the, stories, which, they, thought, continued, to, exist, and, survive, through, the, telling, of, stories, when, jacob, returned, to, marburg, from, paris, in, 1806, their, friend, brentano, sought, the, brothers, help, in, adding, to, his, collection, of, folk, tales, at, which, time, the, brothers, began, to, gather, tales, in, an, organized, fashion, by, 1810, they, had, produced, a, manuscript, collection, of, several, dozen, tales, written, after, inviting, storytellers, to, their, home, and, transcribing, what, they, heard, these, tales, were, heavily, modified, in, transcription, many, had, roots, in, previously, written, sources, at, brentano, s, request, they, printed, and, sent, him, copies, of, the, 53, tales, that, they, collected, for, inclusion, in, his, third, volume, of, des, knaben, wunderhorn, brentano, either, ignored, or, forgot, about, the, tales, leaving, the, copies, in, a, church, in, alsace, where, they, were, found, in, 1920, and, became, known, as, the, lenberg, manuscript, it, is, the, earliest, extant, version, of, the, grimms, collection, and, has, become, a, valuable, source, to, scholars, studying, the, development, of, the, grimms, collection, from, the, time, of, its, inception, the, manuscript, was, published, in, 1927, and, again, in, 1975, the, brothers, gained, a, reputation, for, collecting, tales, from, peasants, although, many, tales, came, from, middle, class, or, aristocratic, acquaintances, wilhelm, s, wife, henriette, dorothea, dortchen, wild, and, her, family, with, their, nursery, maid, told, the, brothers, some, of, the, more, well, known, tales, such, as, hansel, and, gretel, and, sleeping, beauty, wilhelm, collected, some, tales, after, befriending, august, von, haxthausen, whom, he, visited, in, 1811, in, westphalia, where, he, heard, stories, from, von, haxthausen, s, circle, of, friends, several, of, the, storytellers, were, of, huguenot, ancestry, telling, tales, of, french, origin, such, as, those, told, to, the, grimms, by, marie, hassenpflug, an, educated, woman, of, french, huguenot, ancestry, and, it, is, probable, that, these, informants, were, familiar, with, perrault, s, histoires, ou, contes, du, temps, pass, stories, from, past, times, other, tales, were, collected, from, dorothea, viehmann, the, wife, of, a, middle, class, tailor, and, also, of, french, descent, despite, her, middle, class, background, in, the, first, english, translation, she, was, characterized, as, a, peasant, and, given, the, name, gammer, gretel, at, least, one, tale, gevatter, tod, grim, reaper, was, provided, by, composer, wilhelmine, schwertzell, with, whom, wilhelm, had, a, long, correspondence, according, to, scholars, such, as, tatar, and, ruth, bottigheimer, some, of, the, tales, probably, originated, in, written, form, during, the, medieval, period, with, writers, such, as, straparola, and, boccaccio, but, were, modified, in, the, 17th, century, and, again, rewritten, by, the, grimms, moreover, tatar, writes, that, the, brothers, goal, of, preserving, and, shaping, the, tales, as, something, uniquely, german, at, a, time, of, french, occupation, was, a, form, of, intellectual, resistance, and, in, so, doing, they, established, a, methodology, for, collecting, and, preserving, folklore, that, set, the, model, followed, later, by, writers, throughout, europe, during, periods, of, occupation, from, 1807, onward, the, brothers, added, to, the, collection, jacob, established, the, framework, maintained, through, many, iterations, from, 1815, until, his, death, wilhelm, assumed, sole, responsibility, for, editing, and, rewriting, the, tales, he, made, the, tales, stylistically, similar, added, dialogue, removed, pieces, that, might, detract, from, a, rustic, tone, improved, the, plots, and, incorporated, psychological, motifs, ronald, murphy, writes, in, the, owl, the, raven, and, the, dove, that, the, brothers, particularly, wilhelm, also, added, religious, and, spiritual, motifs, to, the, tales, he, believes, that, wilhelm, gleaned, bits, from, old, germanic, faiths, norse, mythology, roman, and, greek, mythology, and, biblical, stories, that, he, reshaped, over, the, years, wilhelm, worked, extensively, on, the, prose, he, expanded, and, added, detail, to, the, stories, to, the, point, that, many, of, them, grew, to, twice, the, length, they, had, in, the, earliest, published, editions, in, the, later, editions, wilhelm, polished, the, language, to, make, it, more, enticing, to, a, bourgeois, audience, eliminated, sexual, elements, and, added, christian, elements, after, 1819, he, began, writing, original, tales, for, children, children, were, not, initially, considered, the, primary, audience, and, adding, didactic, elements, to, existing, tales, some, changes, were, made, in, light, of, unfavorable, reviews, particularly, from, those, who, objected, that, not, all, the, tales, were, suitable, for, children, because, of, scenes, of, violence, and, sexuality, he, worked, to, modify, plots, for, many, of, the, stories, for, example, rapunzel, in, the, first, edition, of, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, clearly, shows, a, sexual, relationship, between, the, prince, and, the, girl, in, the, tower, which, he, edited, out, in, subsequent, editions, tatar, writes, that, morals, were, added, in, the, second, edition, a, king, s, regret, was, added, to, the, scene, in, which, his, wife, is, to, be, burned, at, the, stake, and, often, the, characters, in, the, tale, were, amended, to, appear, more, german, every, fairy, fee, prince, prinz, and, princess, prinzessin, all, words, of, french, origin, was, transformed, into, a, more, teutonic, sounding, enchantress, zauberin, or, wise, woman, weise, frau, king, s, son, k, nigssohn, king, s, daughter, k, nigstochter, the, grimms, legacy, contains, legends, novellas, and, folk, stories, the, vast, majority, of, which, were, not, intended, as, children, s, tales, von, arnim, was, concerned, about, the, content, of, some, of, the, tales, such, as, those, that, showed, children, being, eaten, and, suggested, adding, a, subtitle, to, warn, parents, of, the, content, instead, the, brothers, added, an, introduction, with, cautionary, advice, that, parents, steer, children, toward, age, appropriate, stories, despite, von, arnim, s, unease, none, of, the, tales, were, eliminated, from, the, collection, the, brothers, believed, that, all, the, tales, were, of, value, and, reflected, inherent, cultural, qualities, furthermore, the, stories, were, didactic, in, nature, at, a, time, when, discipline, relied, on, fear, according, to, scholar, linda, d, gh, who, explains, that, tales, such, as, little, red, riding, hood, and, hansel, and, gretel, were, written, as, warning, tales, for, children, the, stories, in, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, include, scenes, of, violence, that, have, since, been, sanitized, for, example, in, the, grimms, original, version, of, snow, white, the, queen, is, little, snow, white, s, mother, not, her, stepmother, but, still, orders, her, huntsman, to, kill, snow, white, her, biological, daughter, and, bring, home, the, child, s, lungs, and, liver, so, that, she, can, eat, them, the, story, ends, with, the, queen, dancing, at, snow, white, s, wedding, wearing, a, pair, of, red, hot, iron, shoes, that, kill, her, another, story, the, goose, girl, has, a, servant, stripped, naked, and, pushed, into, a, barrel, studded, with, sharp, nails, pointing, inward, and, then, rolled, down, the, street, the, grimms, version, of, the, frog, prince, describes, the, princess, throwing, the, frog, against, a, wall, instead, of, kissing, him, to, some, extent, the, cruelty, and, violence, may, reflected, the, medieval, culture, from, which, the, tales, originated, such, as, scenes, of, witches, burning, as, described, in, the, six, swans, tales, with, a, spinning, motif, are, broadly, represented, in, the, collection, in, her, essay, tale, spinners, submerged, voices, in, grimms, fairy, tales, bottigheimer, argues, that, these, stories, reflect, the, degree, to, which, spinning, was, crucial, in, the, life, of, women, in, the, 19th, century, and, earlier, spinning, particularly, of, flax, was, commonly, performed, in, the, home, by, women, many, stories, begin, by, describing, the, occupation, of, their, main, character, as, in, there, once, was, a, miller, yet, spinning, is, never, mentioned, as, an, occupation, this, appears, to, be, because, the, brothers, did, not, consider, it, an, occupation, instead, spinning, was, a, communal, activity, frequently, performed, in, a, spinnstube, spinning, room, a, place, where, women, most, likely, kept, the, oral, traditions, alive, by, telling, stories, while, engaged, in, tedious, work, in, the, stories, a, woman, s, personality, is, often, represented, by, her, attitude, toward, spinning, a, wise, woman, might, be, a, spinster, and, bottigheimer, writes, that, the, spindle, was, the, symbol, of, a, diligent, well, ordered, womanhood, in, some, stories, such, as, rumpelstiltskin, spinning, is, associated, with, a, threat, in, others, spinning, might, be, avoided, by, a, character, who, is, either, too, lazy, or, not, accustomed, to, spinning, because, of, her, high, social, status, the, grimms, work, have, been, subjected, to, feminist, critique, for, example, emma, tennant, writes, but, the, worst, of, it, was, that, two, men, the, brothers, grimm, listened, to, these, old, tales, told, by, mothers, to, their, daughters, and, they, decided, to, record, them, for, posterity, but, the, brothers, grimm, could, understand, only, the, tales, of, courage, and, manliness, and, chivalry, on, the, part, of, the, boys, the, girls, were, relegated, to, virtues, patient, griselda, or, sheer, physical, beauty, sleeping, beauty, beauty, and, the, beast, always, we, must, read, that, our, heroine, is, a, beauty, the, tales, were, also, criticized, for, being, insufficiently, german, which, influenced, the, tales, that, the, brothers, included, and, their, use, of, language, but, scholars, such, as, heinz, r, lleke, say, that, the, stories, are, an, accurate, depiction, of, german, culture, showing, rustic, simplicity, sexual, modesty, german, culture, is, deeply, rooted, in, the, forest, wald, a, dark, dangerous, place, to, be, avoided, most, particularly, the, old, forests, with, large, oak, trees, and, yet, a, place, where, little, red, riding, hood, s, mother, sent, her, daughter, to, deliver, food, to, her, grandmother, s, house, some, critics, such, as, alistair, hauke, use, jungian, analysis, to, say, that, the, deaths, of, the, brothers, father, and, grandfather, are, the, reason, for, the, grimms, tendency, to, idealize, and, excuse, fathers, as, well, as, the, predominance, of, female, villains, in, the, tales, such, as, the, wicked, stepmother, and, stepsisters, in, cinderella, however, this, disregards, the, fact, that, they, were, collectors, not, authors, of, the, tales, another, possible, influence, is, found, in, stories, such, as, the, twelve, brothers, which, mirrors, the, brothers, family, structure, of, several, brothers, facing, and, overcoming, opposition, some, of, the, tales, have, autobiographical, elements, and, according, to, zipes, the, work, may, have, been, a, quest, to, replace, the, family, life, lost, after, their, father, died, the, collection, includes, 41, tales, about, siblings, which, zipes, says, are, representative, of, jacob, and, wilhelm, many, of, the, sibling, stories, follow, a, simple, plot, where, the, characters, lose, a, home, work, industriously, at, a, specific, task, and, in, the, end, find, a, new, home, between, 1812, and, 1864, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, was,

brother, illustrated, the, small, editions, adding, christian, symbolism, to, the, drawings, such, as, depicting, cinderella, s, mother, as, an, angel, and, adding, a, bible, to, the, bedside, table,

dated, 1815, on, the, title, page, together, the, two, volumes, and, their, 156, tales, are, considered, the, first, of, the, annotated, large, editions, a, second, expanded, edition, with, 170, tales, was, published, in, 1819, followed, in, 1822, by, a, volume, of, scholarly, commentary, and, annotations, five, more, large, editions, were, published, in, 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and, 1857,

was, also, released, in, a, popular, poster, sized, bilderbogen, broadsides, format, and, in, single, story, formats, for, the, more, popular, tales, such, as, hansel, and, gretel, the, stories, were, often, added, to, collections, by, other, authors, without, respect, to, copyright, as, the, tales, became, a, focus, of, interest, for, children, s, book, illustrators, with, well, known, artists, such, as, arthur, rackham, walter, crane, and, edmund, dulac, illustrating, another, popular, edition, released, in, the, mid, 19th, century, included, elaborate, etchings, by, george, cruikshank, upon, the, brothers, deaths, the, copyright, went, to, wilhelm, s, son, hermann, grimm, who, continued, the, practice, of, printing, the, volumes, in, expensive, and, complete, editions, but, after, 1893, when, copyright, lapsed, various, publishers, began, to, print, the, stories, in, many, formats, and, editions, in, the, 21st, century, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, is, a, universally, recognized, text, jacob, s, and, wilhelm, s, collection, of, stories, has, been, translated, to, more, than, 160, languages, 120, different, editions, of, the, text, are, available, for, sale, in, the, us, alone, while, at, the, university, of, marburg, the, brothers, came, to, see, culture, as, tied, to, language, and, regarded, the, purest, cultural, expression, in, the, grammar, of, a, language, they, moved, away, from, brentano, s, practice, and, that, of, the, other, romanticists, who, frequently, changed, original, oral, styles, of, folk, tale, to, a, more, literary, style, which, the, brothers, considered, artificial, they, thought, that, the, style, of, the, people, the, volk, reflected, a, natural, and, divinely, inspired, poetry, naturpoesie, as, opposed, to, the, kunstpoesie, art, poetry, which, they, saw, as, artificially, constructed, as, literary, historians, and, scholars, they, delved, into, the, origins, of, stories, and, attempted, to, retrieve, them, from, the, oral, tradition, without, loss, of, the, original, traits, of, oral, language, the, brothers, strongly, believed, that, the, dream, of, national, unity, and, independence, relied, on, a, full, knowledge, of, the, cultural, past, that, was, reflected, in, folklore, they, worked, to, discover, and, crystallize, a, kind, of, germanness, in, the, stories, they, collected, in, the, belief, that, folklore, contained, kernels, of, mythologies, and, legends, crucial, to, understanding, the, essence, of, german, culture, in, examining, culture, from, a, philological, point, of, view, they, sought, to, establish, connections, between, german, law, culture, and, local, beliefs, the, grimms, considered, the, tales, to, have, origins, in, traditional, germanic, folklore, which, they, thought, had, been, contaminated, by, later, literary, tradition, in, the, shift, from, the, oral, tradition, to, the, printed, book, tales, were, translated, from, regional, dialects, to, standard, german, hochdeutsch, or, high, german, but, over, the, course, of, the, many, modifications, and, revisions, the, grimms, sought, to, reintroduce, regionalisms, dialects, and, low, german, to, the, tales, to, reintroduce, the, language, of, the, original, form, of, the, oral, tale, as, early, as, 1812, they, published, die, beiden, ltesten, deutschen, gedichte, aus, dem, achten, jahrhundert, das, lied, von, hildebrand, und, hadubrand, und, das, wei, enbrunner, gebet, the, two, oldest, german, poems, of, the, eighth, century, the, song, of, hildebrand, and, hadubrand, and, the, wessobrunn, prayer, the, song, of, hildebrand, and, hadubrand, is, a, ninth, century, german, heroic, song, while, the, wessobrunn, prayer, is, the, earliest, known, german, heroic, song, between, 1816, and, 1818, the, brothers, published, a, two, volume, work, deutsche, sagen, german, legends, consisting, of, 585, german, legends, jacob, undertook, most, of, the, work, of, collecting, and, editing, the, legends, which, he, organized, according, to, region, and, historical, ancient, legends, and, were, about, real, people, or, events, the, brothers, meant, it, as, a, scholarly, work, but, the, historical, legends, were, often, taken, from, secondary, sources, interpreted, modified, and, rewritten, resulting, in, works, that, were, regarded, as, trademarks, some, scholars, criticized, the, grimms, methodology, in, collecting, and, rewriting, the, legends, yet, conceptually, they, set, an, example, for, legend, collections, that, was, followed, by, others, throughout, europe, unlike, the, collection, of, folk, tales, deutsche, sagen, sold, poorly, but, zipes, says, that, the, collection, translated, to, french, and, danish, in, the, 19th, century, but, not, to, english, until, 1981, is, a, vital, source, for, folklorists, and, critics, alike, less, well, known, in, the, english, speaking, world, is, the, grimms, pioneering, scholarly, work, on, a, german, dictionary, the, deutsches, w, rterbuch, which, they, began, in, 1838, not, until, 1852, did, they, begin, publishing, the, dictionary, in, installments, the, work, on, the, dictionary, was, not, finished, in, their, lifetimes, because, in, it, they, gave, a, history, and, analysis, of, each, word, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, was, not, an, immediate, bestseller, but, its, popularity, grew, with, each, edition, the, early, editions, received, lukewarm, critical, reviews, generally, on, the, basis, that, the, stories, did, not, appeal, to, children, the, brothers, responded, with, modifications, and, rewrites, to, increase, the, book, s, market, appeal, to, that, demographic, by, the, 1870s, the, tales, had, increased, greatly, in, popularity, to, the, point, that, they, were, added, to, the, teaching, curriculum, in, prussia, in, the, 20th, century, the, work, was, second, only, to, the, bible, as, the, most, popular, book, in, germany, its, sales, generated, a, mini, industry, of, critiques, which, analyzed, the, tales, folkloric, content, in, the, context, of, literary, history, socialism, and, psychological, elements, often, along, freudian, and, jungian, lines, in, their, research, the, brothers, made, a, science, of, the, study, of, folklore, see, folkloristics, generating, a, model, of, research, that, launched, general, fieldwork, in, most, european, countries, and, setting, standards, for, research, and, analysis, of, stories, and, legends, that, made, them, pioneers, in, the, field, of, folklore, in, the, 19th, century, in, nazi, germany, the, grimms, stories, were, used, to, foster, nationalism, as, well, as, to, promote, antisemitic, sentiments, in, an, increasingly, hostile, time, for, jewish, people, some, examples, of, notable, antisemitic, works, in, the, grimms, bibliography, are, the, girl, who, was, killed, by, jews, the, jews, stone, the, jew, among, thorns, and, the, good, bargain, the, girl, who, was, killed, by, jews, and, the, jews, stone, tell, stories, of, blood, libel, by, jews, against, innocent, children, in, both, stories, the, children, are, violently, killed, and, mutilated, the, myth, of, blood, libel, was, widely, propagated, during, the, middle, ages, and, is, still, used, to, vilify, jews, today, the, children, in, these, two, stories, are, acquired, in, exchange, for, large, sums, of, money, jewish, wealth, and, greed, are, also, common, antisemitic, tropes, these, tropes, appear, in, the, jew, among, thorns, and, the, good, bargain, in, both, stories, a, jewish, man, is, depicted, as, deceitful, for, the, sake, of, money, in, the, former, the, man, admits, to, stealing, money, and, is, executed, instead, of, the, protagonist, in, the, latter, the, jewish, man, is, found, to, be, deceitful, in, order, to, be, rewarded, with, a, sum, of, money, the, specific, deceit, is, irrelevant, and, here, too, the, protagonist, triumphs, over, the, jew, all, these, stories, paint, jews, as, antagonists, whether, through, murderous, rites, deceit, or, greed, antisemitism, in, folklore, has, contributed, to, the, popularization, of, antisemitic, tropes, and, misconceptions, about, the, jewish, faith, but, the, nazi, party, was, particularly, devoted, to, the, grimms, collected, stories, according, to, author, elizabeth, dalton, nazi, ideologues, enshrined, the, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, as, virtually, a, sacred, text, the, nazi, party, decreed, that, every, household, should, own, a, copy, of, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, later, officials, of, allied, occupied, germany, banned, the, book, for, a, period, in, the, united, states, the, 1937, release, of, walt, disney, s, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, shows, the, triumph, of, good, over, evil, innocence, over, oppression, according, to, zipes, the, grimms, tales, have, provided, much, of, the, early, foundation, on, which, disney, built, an, empire, in, film, the, cinderella, motif, the, story, of, a, poor, girl, finding, love, and, success, has, been, repeated, in, movies, such, as, pretty, woman, ever, after, maid, in, manhattan, and, ella, enchanted, 20th, century, educators, debated, the, value, and, influence, of, teaching, stories, that, include, brutality, and, violence, and, some, of, the, more, gruesome, details, were, sanitized, d, gh, writes, that, some, educators, in, the, belief, that, children, should, be, shielded, from, cruelty, of, any, form, believe, that, stories, with, a, happy, ending, are, fine, to, teach, whereas, those, that, are, darker, particularly, the, legends, might, pose, more, harm, on, the, other, hand, some, educators, and, psychologists, believe, that, children, easily, discern, the, difference, between, what, is, a, story, and, what, is, not, and, that, the, tales, continue, to, have, value, for, children, the, publication, of, bruno, bettelheim, s, 1976, the, uses, of, enchantment, brought, a, new, wave, of, interest, in, the, stories, as, children, s, literature, with, an, emphasis, on, the, therapeutic, value, for, children, more, popular, stories, such, as, hansel, and, gretel, and, little, red, riding, hood, have, become, staples, of, modern, childhood, presented, in, coloring, books, puppet, shows, and, cartoons, other, stories, have, been, considered, too, gruesome, and, have, not, made, a, popular, transition, regardless, the, grimms, stories, continue, to, be, popular, around, the, world, although, a, recent, study, in, england, appears, to, suggest, that, parents, consider, the, stories, overly, violent, and, inappropriate, for, young, children, nevertheless, children, remain, enamored, of, the, grimms, fairy, tales, with, the, brothers, themselves, embraced, as, the, creators, of, the, stories, and, even, as, part, of, the, stories, themselves, the, film, brothers, grimm, imagines, them, as, con, artists, exploiting, superstitious, german, peasants, until, they, are, asked, to, confront, a, genuine, fairy, tale, curse, that, calls, them, to, finally, be, heroes, the, movie, ever, after, shows, the, grimms, in, their, role, as, collectors, of, fairy, tales, though, they, learn, to, their, surprise, that, at, least, one, of, their, stories, cinderella, is, true, grimm, follows, a, detective, who, discovers, that, he, is, a, grimm, the, latest, in, a, line, of, guardians, who, are, sworn, to, keep, the, balance,
