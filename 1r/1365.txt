vice, president, welcomed, the, president, s, initiatives, and, worked, energetically, to, accomplish, white, house, objectives, because, of, the, collaboration, between, these, two, leaders, nixon, deserves, the, title, the, first, modern, vice, president, despite, intense, campaigning, by, nixon, who, reprised, his, strong, attacks, on, the, democrats, the, republicans, lost, control, of, both, houses, of, congress, in, the, 1954, elections, these, losses, caused, nixon, to, contemplate, leaving, politics, once, he, had, served, out, his, term, on, september, 24, 1955, president, eisenhower, suffered, a, heart, attack, and, his, condition, was, initially, believed, to, be, life, threatening, eisenhower, was, unable, to, perform, his, duties, for, six, weeks, the, twenty, fifth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, had, not, yet, been, proposed, and, the, vice, president, had, no, formal, power, to, act, nonetheless, nixon, acted, in, eisenhower, s, stead, during, this, period, presiding, over, cabinet, meetings, and, ensuring, that, aides, and, cabinet, officers, did, not, seek, power, according, to, nixon, biographer, stephen, ambrose, nixon, had, earned, the, high, praise, he, received, for, his, conduct, during, the, crisis, he, made, no, attempt, to, seize, power, his, spirits, buoyed, nixon, sought, a, second, term, but, some, of, eisenhower, s, aides, aimed, to, displace, him, in, a, december, 1955, meeting, eisenhower, proposed, that, nixon, not, run, for, reelection, and, instead, become, a, cabinet, officer, in, a, second, eisenhower, administration, to, give, him, administrative, experience, before, a, 1960, presidential, run, nixon, believed, this, would, destroy, his, political, career, when, eisenhower, announced, his, reelection, bid, in, february, 1956, he, hedged, on, the, choice, of, his, running, mate, saying, it, was, improper, to, address, that, question, until, he, had, been, renominated, although, no, republican, was, opposing, eisenhower, nixon, received, a, substantial, number, of, write, in, votes, against, the, president, in, the, 1956, new, hampshire, primary, election, in, late, april, the, president, announced, that, nixon, would, again, be, his, running, mate, eisenhower, and, nixon, were, reelected, by, a, comfortable, margin, in, the, november, 1956, election, in, early, 1957, nixon,

civil, rights, leaders, were, divided, over, whether, eisenhower, should, sign, it, nixon, advised, the, president, to, sign, the, bill, which, he, did, eisenhower, suffered, a, mild, stroke, in, november, 1957, and, nixon, gave, a, press, conference, assuring, the, nation, that, the, cabinet, was, functioning, well, as, a, team, during, eisenhower, s, brief, illness, on, april, 27, 1958, richard, and, pat, nixon, reluctantly, embarked, on, a, goodwill, tour, of, south, america, in, montevideo, uruguay, nixon, made, an, impromptu, visit, to, a, college, campus, where, he, fielded, questions, from, students, on, u, s, foreign, policy, the, trip, was, uneventful, until, the, nixon, party, reached, lima, peru, where, he, was, met, with, student, demonstrations, nixon, went, to, the, historical, campus, of, national, university, of, san, marcos, the, oldest, university, in, the, americas, got, out, of, his, car, to, confront, the, students, and, stayed, until, forced, back, into, the, car, by, a, volley, of, thrown, objects, at, his, hotel, nixon, faced, another, mob, and, one, demonstrator, spat, on, him, in, caracas, venezuela, nixon, and, his, wife, were, spat, on, by, anti, american, demonstrators, and, their, limousine, was, attacked, by, a, pipe, wielding, mob, according, to, ambrose, nixon, s, courageous, conduct, caused, even, some, of, his, bitterest, enemies, to, give, him, some, grudging, respect, reporting, to, the, cabinet, after, the, trip, nixon, claimed, there, was, absolute, proof, that, were, directed, and, controlled, by, a, central, communist, conspiracy, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, and, his, brother, director, of, central, intelligence, allen, dulles, both, concurred, with, nixon, in, july, 1959, president, eisenhower, sent, nixon, to, the, soviet, union, for, the, opening, of, the, american, national, exhibition, in, moscow, on, july, 24, nixon, was, touring, the, exhibits, with, soviet, first, secretary, and, premier, nikita, khrushchev, when, the, two, stopped, at, a, model, of, an, american, kitchen, and, engaged, in, an, impromptu, exchange, about, the, merits, of, capitalism, versus, communism, that, became, known, as, the, kitchen, debate, in, 1960, nixon, launched, his, first, campaign, for, president, of, the, united, states, officially, announcing, on, january, 9, 1960, he, faced, little, opposition, in, the, republican, primaries, and, chose, former, massachusetts, senator, henry, cabot, lodge, jr, as, his, running, mate, his, democratic, opponent, was, john, f, kennedy, and, the, race, remained, close, for, the, duration, nixon, campaigned, on, his, experience, but, kennedy, called, for, new, blood, and, claimed, the, eisenhower, nixon, administration, had, allowed, the, soviet, union, to, overtake, the, u, s, in, quantity, and, quality, of, ballistic, missiles, while, kennedy, faced, issues, about, his, catholicism, nixon, remained, a, divisive, figure, to, some, televised, presidential, debates, made, their, debut, as, a, political, medium, during, the, campaign, in, the, first, of, four, such, debates, nixon, appeared, pale, with, a, five, o, clock, shadow, in, contrast, to, the, photogenic, kennedy, nixon, s, performance, in, the, debate, was, perceived, to, be, mediocre, in, the, visual, medium, of, television, though, many, people, listening, on, the, radio, thought, nixon, had, won, nixon, narrowly, lost, the, election, with, kennedy, winning, the, popular, vote, by, only, 112, 827, votes, 0, 2, percent, there, were, charges, of, voter, fraud, in, texas, and, illinois, both, states, won, by, kennedy, nixon, refused, to, consider, contesting, the, election, feeling, a, lengthy, controversy, would, diminish, the, united, states, in, the, eyes, of, the, world, and, that, the, uncertainty, would, hurt, u, s, interests, at, the, end, of, his, term, of, office, as, vice, president, in, january, 1961, nixon, and, his, family, returned, to, california, where, he, practiced, law, and, wrote, a, bestselling, book, six, crises, which, included, coverage, of, the, hiss, case, eisenhower, s, heart, attack, and, the, fund, crisis, which, had, been, resolved, by, the, checkers, speech, local, and, national, republican, leaders, encouraged, nixon, to, challenge, incumbent, pat, brown, for, governor, of, california, in, the, 1962, gubernatorial, election, despite, initial, reluctance, nixon, entered, the, race, the, campaign, was, clouded, by, public, suspicion, that, nixon, viewed, the, office, as, a, stepping, stone, for, another, presidential, run, some, opposition, from, the, far, right, of, the, party, and, his, own, lack, of, interest, in, being, california, s, governor, nixon, hoped, a, successful, run, would, confirm, his, status, as, the, nation, s, leading, active, republican, politician, and, ensure, he, remained, a, major, player, in, national, politics, instead, he, lost, to, brown, by, more, than, five, percentage, points, and, the, defeat, was, widely, believed, to, be, the, end, of, his, political, career, in, an, impromptu, concession, speech, the, morning, after, the, election, nixon, blamed, the, media, for, favoring, his, opponent, saying, you, won, t, have, nixon, to, kick, around, anymore, because, gentlemen, this, is, my, last, press, conference, the, california, defeat, was, highlighted, in, the, november, 11, 1962, episode, of, howard, k, smith, s, abc, news, show, howard, k, smith, news, and, comment, titled, the, political, obituary, of, richard, m, nixon, alger, hiss, appeared, on, the, program, and, many, members, of, the, public, complained, that, it, was, unseemly, to, give, a, convicted, felon, air, time, to, attack, a, former, vice, president, the, furor, drove, smith, and, his, program, from, the, air, and, public, sympathy, for, nixon, grew, in, 1963, the, nixon, family, traveled, to, europe, where, nixon, gave, press, conferences, and, met, with, leaders, of, the, countries, he, visited, the, family, moved, to, new, york, city, where, nixon, became, a, senior, partner, in, the, leading, law, firm, nixon, mudge, rose, guthrie, alexander, when, announcing, his, california, campaign, nixon, had, pledged, not, to, run, for, president, in, 1964, even, if, he, had, not, he, believed, it, would, be, difficult, to, defeat, kennedy, or, after, his, assassination, kennedy, s, successor, lyndon, johnson, in, 1964, nixon, won, write, in, votes, in, the, primaries, and, was, considered, a, serious, contender, by, both, gallup, polls, and, members, of, the, press, he, was, even, placed, on, a, primary, ballot, as, an, active, candidate, by, oregon, s, secretary, of, state, as, late, as, two, months, before, the, 1964, republican, national, convention, however, nixon, fulfilled, his, promise, to, remain, out, of, the, presidential, nomination, process, and, instead, endorsed, arizona, senator, barry, goldwater, the, eventual, republican, nominee, when, goldwater, won, the, nomination, nixon, was, selected, to, introduce, him, at, the, convention, nixon, felt, that, goldwater, was, unlikely, to, win, but, campaigned, for, him, loyally, in, the, 1964, general, election, goldwater, lost, in, a, landslide, to, johnson, and, republicans, experienced, heavy, losses, in, congress, and, among, state, governors, nixon, was, one, of, the, few, leading, republicans, not, blamed, for, the, disastrous, results, and, he, sought, to, build, on, that, in, the, 1966, congressional, elections, in, which, he, campaigned, for, many, republicans, and, sought, to, regain, seats, lost, in, the, johnson, landslide, nixon, was, credited, with, helping, republicans, win, major, electoral, gains, that, year, in, 1967, nixon, was, approached, by, an, associate, at, his, firm, in, leonard, garment, about, a, case, involving, the, press, and, perceived, invasion, of, privacy, garment, suggested, nixon, to, argue, on, behalf, of, the, hill, family, in, time, inc, v, hill, at, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, nixon, studied, strenuously, in, the, months, prior, to, the, oral, argument, before, the, court, while, the, final, decision, was, in, favor, of, time, inc, nixon, was, encouraged, by, the, praise, he, received, for, his, argument, it, was, the, first, and, only, case, he, argued, in, front, of, the, supreme, court, at, the, end, of, 1967, nixon, told, his, family, he, planned, to, run, for, president, a, second, time, pat, nixon, did, not, always, enjoy, public, life, being, embarrassed, for, example, by, the, need, to, reveal, how, little, the, family, owned, in, the, checkers, speech, she, still, managed, to, be, supportive, of, her, husband, s, ambitions, nixon, believed, that, with, the, democrats, torn, over, the, issue, of, the, vietnam, war, a, republican, had, a, good, chance, of, winning, although, he, expected, the, election, to, be, as, close, as, in, 1960, an, exceptionally, tumultuous, primary, election, season, began, as, the, tet, offensive, was, launched, in, january, 1968, president, johnson, withdrew, as, a, candidate, in, march, after, an, unexpectedly, poor, showing, in, the, new, hampshire, primary, in, june, senator, robert, f, kennedy, a, democratic, candidate, was, assassinated, just, moments, after, his, victory, in, the, california, primary, on, the, republican, side, nixon, s, main, opposition, was, michigan, governor, george, romney, though, new, york, governor, nelson, rockefeller, and, california, governor, ronald, reagan, each, hoped, to, be, nominated, in, a, brokered, convention, nixon, secured, the, nomination, on, the, first, ballot, he, was, able, to, secure, the, nomination, to, the, support, of, many, southern, delegates, after, he, and, his, subordinates, made, concessions, to, strom, thurmond, and, harry, dent, he, selected, maryland, governor, spiro, agnew, as, his, running, mate, a, choice, which, nixon, believed, would, unite, the, party, appealing, both, to, northern, moderates, and, to, southerners, disaffected, with, the, democrats, nixon, s, democratic, opponent, in, the, general, election, was, vice, president, hubert, humphrey, who, was, nominated, at, a, convention, marked, by, violent, protests, throughout, the, campaign, nixon, portrayed, himself, as, a, figure, of, stability, during, this, period, of, national, unrest, and, upheaval, he, appealed, to, what, he, later, called, the, silent, majority, of, socially, conservative, americans, who, disliked, the, hippie, counterculture, and, the, anti, war, demonstrators, agnew, became, an, increasingly, vocal, critic, of, these, groups, solidifying, nixon, s, position, with, the, right, nixon, waged, a, prominent, television, advertising, campaign, meeting, with, supporters, in, front, of, cameras, he, stressed, that, the, crime, rate, was, too, high, and, attacked, what, he, perceived, as, a, surrender, of, the, united, states, nuclear, superiority, by, the, democrats, nixon, promised, peace, with, honor, in, the, vietnam, war, and, proclaimed, that, new, leadership, will, end, the, war, and, win, the, peace, in, the, pacific, he, did, not, give, specifics, of, how, he, hoped, to, end, the, war, resulting, in, media, intimations, that, he, must, have, a, secret, plan, his, slogan, of, nixon, s, the, one, proved, to, be, effective, johnson, s, negotiators, hoped, to, reach, a, truce, in, vietnam, or, at, least, a, cessation, of, bombings, on, october, 22, 1968, candidate, nixon, received, information, that, johnson, was, preparing, a, so, called, october, surprise, abandoning, three, non, negotiable, conditions, for, a, bombing, halt, to, help, elect, humphrey, in, the, last, days, of, the, campaign, whether, the, nixon, campaign, interfered, with, negotiations, between, the, johnson, administration, and, the, south, vietnamese, by, engaging, anna, chennault, a, fundraiser, for, the, republican, party, remains, a, controversy, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, government, of, south, vietnam, needed, encouragement, to, opt, out, of, a, peace, process, they, considered, disadvantageous, in, a, three, way, race, between, nixon, humphrey, and, american, independent, party, candidate, george, wallace, nixon, defeated, humphrey, by, only, 500, 000, votes, a, margin, almost, as, close, as, in, 1960, with, both, elections, seeing, a, gap, of, less, than, one, percentage, point, of, the, popular, vote, however, nixon, earned, 301, electoral, votes, to, 191, for, humphrey, and, 46, for, wallace, a, majority, he, became, the, first, non, incumbent, vice, president, to, be, elected, president, in, his, victory, speech, nixon, pledged, that, his, administration, would, try, to, bring, the, divided, nation, together, nixon, said, i, have, received, a, very, gracious, message, from, the, vice, president, congratulating, me, for, winning, the, election, i, congratulated, him, for, his, gallant, and, courageous, fight, against, great, odds, i, also, told, him, that, i, know, exactly, how, he, felt, i, know, how, it, feels, to, lose, a, close, one, nixon, was, inaugurated, as, president, on, january, 20, 1969, sworn, in, by, his, onetime, political, rival, chief, justice, earl, warren, pat, nixon, held, the, family, bibles, open, at, isaiah, 2, 4, which, reads, they, shall, beat, their, swords, into, plowshares, and, their, spears, into, pruning, hooks, in, his, inaugural, address, which, received, almost, uniformly, positive, reviews, nixon, remarked, that, the, greatest, honor, history, can, bestow, is, the, title, of, peacemaker, a, phrase, that, found, a, place, on, his, gravestone, he, spoke, about, turning, partisan, politics, into, a, new, age, of, unity, in, these, difficult, years, america, has, suffered, from, a, fever, of, words, from, inflated, rhetoric, that, promises, more, than, it, can, deliver, from, angry, rhetoric, that, fans, discontents, into, hatreds, from, bombastic, rhetoric, that, postures, instead, of, persuading, we, cannot, learn, from, one, another, until, we, stop, shouting, at, one, another, until, we, speak, quietly, enough, so, that, our, words, can, be, heard, as, well, as, our, voices, nixon, laid, the, groundwork, for, his, overture, to, china, before, he, became, president, writing, in, foreign, affairs, a, year, before, his, election, there, is, no, place, on, this, small, planet, for, a, billion, of, its, potentially, most, able, people, to, live, in, angry, isolation, among, the, reasons, that, nixon, sought, to, improve, relations, with, china, was, in, the, hope, of, weakening, the, soviet, union, and, decreasing, china, s, support, to, the, north, in, the, vietnam, war, nixon, ultimately, used, the, idea, of, gaining, leverage, against, the, soviet, union, through, relations, with, china, to, obtain, the, support, of, key, conservative, figures, including, barry, goldwater, and, ronald, reagan, assisting, him, in, pursuing, relations, with, china, was, henry, kissinger, nixon, s, national, security, advisor, and, future, secretary, of, state, they, collaborated, closely, bypassing, cabinet, officials, with, relations, between, the, soviet, union, and, china, at, a, nadir, border, clashes, between, the, two, took, place, during, nixon, s, first, year, in, office, nixon, sent, private, word, to, the, chinese, that, he, desired, closer, relations, a, breakthrough, came, in, early, 1971, when, chinese, communist, party, ccp, chairman, mao, zedong, invited, a, team, of, american, table, tennis, players, to, visit, china, and, play, against, top, chinese, players, nixon, followed, up, by, sending, kissinger, to, china, for, clandestine, meetings, with, chinese, officials, on, july, 15, 1971, with, announcements, from, washington, and, beijing, it, was, learned, that, the, president, would, visit, china, the, following, february, the, secrecy, had, allowed, both, sets, of, leaders, time, to, prepare, the, political, climate, in, their, countries, for, the, visit, in, february, 1972, nixon, and, his, wife, traveled, to, china, after, kissinger, briefed, nixon, for, over, 40, hours, in, preparation, upon, touching, down, the, president, and, first, lady, emerged, from, air, force, one, and, were, greeted, by, chinese, premier, zhou, enlai, nixon, made, a, point, of, shaking, zhou, s, hand, something, which, then, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, had, refused, to, do, in, 1954, when, the, two, met, in, geneva, more, than, a, hundred, television, journalists, accompanied, the, president, on, nixon, s, orders, television, was, strongly, favored, over, printed, publications, as, nixon, felt, that, the, medium, would, capture, the, visit, much, better, than, print, it, also, gave, him, the, opportunity, to, snub, the, print, journalists, he, despised, nixon, and, kissinger, immediately, met, for, an, hour, with, ccp, chairman, mao, zedong, and, premier, zhou, at, mao, s, official, private, residence, where, they, discussed, a, range, of, issues, mao, later, told, his, doctor, that, he, had, been, impressed, by, nixon, s, forthrightness, unlike, the, leftists, and, the, soviets, he, said, he, was, suspicious, of, kissinger, though, the, national, security, advisor, referred, to, their, meeting, as, his, encounter, with, history, a, formal, banquet, welcoming, the, presidential, party, was, given, that, evening, in, the, great, hall, of, the, people, the, following, day, nixon, met, with, zhou, the, joint, communique, following, this, meeting, recognized, taiwan, as, a, part, of, china, and, looked, forward, to, a, peaceful, solution, to, the, problem, of, reunification, when, not, in, meetings, nixon, toured, architectural, wonders, including, the, forbidden, city, the, ming, tombs, and, the, great, wall, americans, took, their, first, glance, into, everyday, chinese, life, through, the, cameras, that, accompanied, pat, nixon, who, toured, the, city, of, beijing, and, visited, communes, schools, factories, and, hospitals, the, visit, ushered, in, a, new, era, of, us, china, relations, fearing, the, possibility, of, a, us, china, alliance, the, soviet, union, yielded, to, pressure, for, d, tente, with, the, united, states, this, was, one, component, of, triangular, diplomacy, when, nixon, took, office, about, 300, american, soldiers, were, dying, each, week, in, vietnam, and, the, war, was, widely, unpopular, in, the, united, states, the, subject, of, ongoing, violent, protests, the, johnson, administration, had, offered, to, suspend, bombing, unconditionally, in, exchange, for, negotiations, but, to, no, avail, according, to, walter, isaacson, nixon, concluded, soon, after, taking, office, that, the, vietnam, war, could, not, be, won, and, he, was, determined, to, end, it, quickly, he, sought, an, arrangement, that, would, permit, american, forces, to, withdraw, while, leaving, south, vietnam, secure, against, attack, nixon, approved, a, secret, b, 52, carpet, bombing, campaign, of, north, vietnamese, and, khmer, rouge, positions, in, cambodia, beginning, in, march, 1969, and, code, named, operation, menu, without, the, consent, of, cambodian, leader, norodom, sihanouk, in, mid, 1969, nixon, began, efforts, to, negotiate, peace, with, the, north, vietnamese, sending, a, personal, letter, to, their, leaders, and, peace, talks, began, in, paris, initial, talks, did, not, result, in, an, agreement, and, in, may, 1969, he, publicly, proposed, to, withdraw, all, american, troops, from, south, vietnam, provided, north, vietnam, did, so, and, suggesting, south, vietnam, hold, internationally, supervised, elections, with, viet, cong, participation, in, july, 1969, nixon, visited, south, vietnam, where, he, met, with, his, u, s, military, commanders, and, president, nguy, n, v, n, thi, u, amid, protests, at, home, demanding, an, immediate, pullout, he, implemented, a, strategy, of, replacing, american, troops, with, vietnamese, troops, known, as, vietnamization, he, soon, instituted, phased, u, s, troop, withdrawals, but, also, authorized, incursions, into, laos, in, part, to, interrupt, the, ho, chi, minh, trail, passing, through, laos, and, cambodia, and, used, to, supply, north, vietnamese, forces, in, march, 1970, at, the, explicit, request, of, the, khmer, rouge, and, negotiated, by, pol, pot, s, then, second, in, command, nuon, chea, north, vietnamese, troops, launched,

further, protests, erupted, against, perceived, expansion, of, the, conflict, which, resulted, in, ohio, national, guardsmen, killing, four, unarmed, students, at, kent, state, university, nixon, s, responses, to, protesters, included, an, impromptu, early, morning, meeting, with, them, at, the, lincoln, memorial, on, may, 9, 1970, nixon, s, campaign, promise, to, curb, the, war, contrasted, with, the, escalated, bombing, led, to, claims, that, nixon, had, a, credibility, gap, on, the, issue, it, is, estimated, that, between, 50, 000, and, 150, 000, people, were, killed, during, the, bombing, of, cambodia, between, 1970, and, 1973, in, 1971, excerpts, from, the, pentagon, papers, which, had, been, leaked, by, daniel, ellsberg, were, published, by, the, new, york, times, and, the, washington, post, when, news, of, the, leak, first, appeared, nixon, was, inclined, to, do, nothing, the, papers, a, history, of, united, states, involvement, in, vietnam, mostly, concerned, the, lies, of, prior, administrations, and, contained, few, real, revelations, he, was, persuaded, by, kissinger, that, the, papers, were, more, harmful, than, they, appeared, and, the, president, tried, to, prevent, publication, but, the, supreme, court, ruled, in, favor, of, the, newspapers, as, u, s, troop, withdrawals, continued, conscription, was, phased, out, by, 1973, and, the, armed, forces, became, all, volunteer, after, years, of, fighting, the, paris, peace, accords, were, signed, at, the, beginning, of, 1973, the, agreement, implemented, a, cease, fire, and, allowed, for, the, withdrawal, of, remaining, american, troops, without, requiring, withdrawal, of, the, 160, 000, north, vietnam, army, regulars, located, in, the, south, once, american, combat, support, ended, there, was, a, brief, truce, before, fighting, resumed, and, north, vietnam, conquered, south, vietnam, in, 1975, nixon, had, been, a, firm, supporter, of, kennedy, during, the, 1961, bay, of, pigs, invasion, and, 1962, cuban, missile, crisis, on, taking, office, in, 1969, he, stepped, up, covert, operations, against, cuba, and, its, president, fidel, castro, he, maintained, close, relations, with, the, cuban, american, exile, community, through, his, friend, bebe, rebozo, who, often, suggested, ways, of, irritating, castro, the, soviets, and, cubans, became, concerned, fearing, nixon, might, attack, cuba, and, break, the, understanding, between, kennedy, and, khrushchev, that, ended, the, missile, crisis, in, august, 1970, the, soviets, asked, nixon, to, reaffirm, the, understanding, which, he, did, despite, his, hard, line, against, castro, the, process, was, not, completed, before, the, soviets, began, expanding, their, base, at, the, cuban, port, of, cienfuegos, in, october, 1970, a, minor, confrontation, ensued, the, soviets, stipulated, they, would, not, use, cienfuegos, for, submarines, bearing, ballistic, missiles, and, the, final, round, of, diplomatic, notes, were, exchanged, in, november, the, election, of, marxist, candidate, salvador, allende, as, president, of, chile, in, september, 1970, spurred, a, vigorous, campaign, of, covert, opposition, to, him, by, nixon, and, kissinger, 25, this, began, by, trying, to, convince, the, chilean, congress, to, confirm, jorge, alessandri, as, the, winner, of, the, election, and, then, messages, to, military, officers, in, support, of, a, coup, other, support, included, strikes, organized, against, allende, and, funding, for, allende, opponents, it, was, even, alleged, that, nixon, personally, authorized, 700, 000, in, covert, funds, to, print, anti, allende, messages, in, a, prominent, chilean, newspaper, 93, following, an, extended, period, of, social, political, and, economic, unrest, general, augusto, pinochet, assumed, power, in, a, violent, coup, d, tat, on, september, 11, 1973, among, the, dead, was, allende, nixon, used, the, improving, international, environment, to, address, the, topic, of, nuclear, peace, following, the, announcement, of, his, visit, to, china, the, nixon, administration, concluded, negotiations, for, him, to, visit, the, soviet, union, the, president, and, first, lady, arrived, in, moscow, on, may, 22, 1972, and, met, with, leonid, brezhnev, the, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, alexei, kosygin, the, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, and, nikolai, podgorny, the, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, among, other, leading, soviet, officials, nixon, engaged, in, intense, negotiations, with, brezhnev, out, of, the, summit, came, agreements, for, increased, trade, and, two, landmark, arms, control, treaties, salt, i, the, first, comprehensive, limitation, pact, signed, by, the, two, superpowers, and, the, anti, ballistic, missile, treaty, which, banned, the, development, of, systems, designed, to, intercept, incoming, missiles, nixon, and, brezhnev, proclaimed, a, new, era, of, peaceful, coexistence, a, banquet, was, held, that, evening, at, the, kremlin, nixon, and, kissinger, planned, to, link, arms, control, to, d, tente, and, to, the, resolution, of, other, urgent, problems, through, what, nixon, called, linkage, david, tal, argues, the, linkage, between, strategic, arms, limitations, and, outstanding, issues, such, as, the, middle, east, berlin, and, foremost, vietnam, thus, became, central, to, nixon, s, and, kissinger, s, policy, of, d, tente, through, the, employment, of, linkage, they, hoped, to, change, the, nature, and, course, of, u, s, foreign, policy, including, u, s, nuclear, disarmament, and, arms, control, policy, and, to, separate, them, from, those, practiced, by, nixon, s, predecessors, they, also, intended, through, linkage, to, make, u, s, arms, control, policy, part, of, d, tente, his, policy, of, linkage, had, in, fact, failed, it, failed, mainly, because, it, was, based, on, flawed, assumptions, and, false, premises, the, foremost, of, which, was, that, the, soviet, union, wanted, strategic, arms, limitation, agreement, much, more, than, the, united, states, did, seeking, to, foster, better, relations, with, the, united, states, china, and, the, soviet, union, both, cut, back, on, their, diplomatic, support, for, north, vietnam, and, advised, hanoi, to, come, to, terms, militarily, nixon, later, described, his, strategy, i, had, long, believed, that, an, indispensable, element, of, any, successful, peace, initiative, in, vietnam, was, to, enlist, if, possible, the, help, of, the, soviets, and, the, chinese, though, rapprochement, with, china, and, d, tente, with, the, soviet, union, were, ends, in, themselves, i, also, considered, them, possible, means, to, hasten, the, end, of, the, war, at, worst, hanoi, was, bound, to, feel, less, confident, if, washington, was, dealing, with, moscow, and, beijing, at, best, if, the, two, major, communist, powers, decided, that, they, had, bigger, fish, to, fry, hanoi, would, be, pressured, into, negotiating, a, settlement, we, could, accept, in, 1973, nixon, encouraged, the, export, import, bank, to, finance, in, part, a, trade, deal, with, the, soviet, union, in, which, armand, hammer, s, occidental, petroleum, would, export, phosphate, from, florida, to, the, soviet, union, and, import, soviet, ammonia, the, deal, valued, at, 20, billion, over, 20, years, involved, the, construction, of, two, major, soviet, port, facilities, at, odessa, and, ventspils, and, a, pipeline, connecting, four, ammonia, plants, in, the, greater, volga, region, to, the, port, at, odessa, in, 1973, nixon, announced, his, administration, was, committed, to, seeking, most, favored, nation, trade, status, with, the, ussr, which, was, challenged, by, congress, in, the, jackson, vanik, amendment, during, the, previous, two, years, nixon, had, made, considerable, progress, in, u, s, soviet, relations, and, he, embarked, on, a, second, trip, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1974, he, arrived, in, moscow, on, june, 27, to, a, welcome, ceremony, cheering, crowds, and, a, state, dinner, at, the, grand, kremlin, palace, that, evening, nixon, and, brezhnev, met, in, yalta, where, they, discussed, a, proposed, mutual, defense, pact, d, tente, and, mirvs, nixon, considered, proposing, a, comprehensive, test, ban, treaty, but, he, felt, he, would, not, have, time, to, complete, it, during, his, presidency, there, were, no, significant, breakthroughs, in, these, negotiations, as, part, of, the, nixon, doctrine, the, u, s, avoided, giving, direct, combat, assistance, to, its, allies, and, instead, gave, them, assistance, to, defend, themselves, during, the, nixon, administration, the, u, s, greatly, increased, arms, sales, to, the, middle, east, particularly, israel, iran, and, saudi, arabia, the, nixon, administration, strongly, supported, israel, an, american, ally, in, the, middle, east, but, the, support, was, not, unconditional, nixon, believed, israel, should, make, peace, with, its, arab, neighbors, and, that, the, u, s, should, encourage, it, the, president, believed, that, except, during, the, suez, crisis, the, u, s, had, failed, to, intervene, with, israel, and, should, use, the, leverage, of, the, large, u, s, military, aid, to, israel, to, urge, the, parties, to, the, negotiating, table, the, arab, israeli, conflict, was, not, a, major, focus, of, nixon, s, attention, during, his, first, term, for, one, thing, he, felt, that, no, matter, what, he, did, american, jews, would, oppose, his, reelection, on, october, 6, 1973, an, arab, coalition, led, by, egypt, and, syria, supported, with, arms, and, materiel, by, the, soviet, union, attacked, israel, in, the, yom, kippur, war, israel, suffered, heavy, losses, and, nixon, ordered, an, airlift, to, resupply, israeli, losses, cutting, through, inter, departmental, squabbles, and, bureaucracy, and, taking, personal, responsibility, for, any, response, by, arab, nations, more, than, a, week, later, by, the, time, the, u, s, and, soviet, union, began, negotiating, a, truce, israel, had, penetrated, deep, into, enemy, territory, the, truce, negotiations, rapidly, escalated, into, a, superpower, crisis, when, israel, gained, the, upper, hand, egyptian, president, sadat, requested, a, joint, u, s, ussr, peacekeeping, mission, which, the, u, s, refused, when, soviet, premier, brezhnev, threatened, to, unilaterally, enforce, any, peacekeeping, mission, militarily, nixon, ordered, the, u, s, military, to, defcon, 3, placing, all, u, s, military, personnel, and, bases, on, alert, for, nuclear, war, this, was, the, closest, the, world, had, come, to, nuclear, war, since, the, cuban, missile, crisis, brezhnev, backed, down, as, a, result, of, nixon, s, actions, because, israel, s, victory, was, largely, due, to, u, s, support, the, arab, opec, nations, retaliated, by, refusing, to, sell, crude, oil, to, the, u, s, resulting, in, the, 1973, oil, crisis, the, embargo, caused, gasoline, shortages, and, rationing, in, the, united, states, in, late, 1973, and, was, eventually, ended, by, the, oil, producing, nations, as, peace, in, the, middle, east, took, hold, after, the, war, and, under, nixon, s, presidency, the, u, s, reestablished, relations, with, egypt, for, the, first, time, since, 1967, nixon, used, the, middle, east, crisis, to, restart, the, stalled, middle, east, peace, negotiations, he, wrote, in, a, confidential, memo, to, kissinger, on, october, 20, i, believe, that, beyond, a, doubt, we, are, now, facing, the, best, opportunity, we, have, had, in, 15, years, to, build, a, lasting, peace, in, the, middle, east, i, am, convinced, history, will, hold, us, responsible, if, we, let, this, opportunity, slip, by, i, now, consider, a, permanent, middle, east, settlement, to, be, the, most, important, final, goal, to, which, we, must, devote, ourselves, nixon, made, one, of, his, final, international, visits, as, president, to, the, middle, east, in, june, 1974, and, became, the, first, president, to, visit, israel, at, the, time, nixon, took, office, in, 1969, inflation, was, at, 4, 7, percent, its, highest, rate, since, the, korean, war, the, great, society, had, been, enacted, under, johnson, which, together, with, the, vietnam, war, costs, was, causing, large, budget, deficits, unemployment, was, low, but, interest, rates, were, at, their, highest, in, a, century, nixon, s, major, economic, goal, was, to, reduce, inflation, the, most, obvious, means, of, doing, so, was, to, end, the, war, this, could, not, be, accomplished, overnight, and, the, u, s, economy, continued, to, struggle, through, 1970, contributing, to, a, lackluster, republican, performance, in, the, midterm, congressional, elections, democrats, controlled, both, houses, of, congress, throughout, nixon, s, presidency, according, to, political, economist, nigel, bowles, in, his, 2011, study, of, nixon, s, economic, record, the, new, president, did, little, to, alter, johnson, s, policies, through, the, first, year, of, his, presidency, nixon, was, far, more, interested, in, foreign, affairs, than, domestic, policies, but, he, believed, that, voters, tend, to, focus, on, their, own, financial, condition, and, that, economic, conditions, were, a, threat, to, his, reelection, as, part, of, his, new, federalism, views, he, proposed, grants, to, the, states, but, these, proposals, were, for, the, most, part, lost, in, the, congressional, budget, process, however, nixon, gained, political, credit, for, advocating, them, in, 1970, congress, had, granted, the, president, the, power, to, impose, wage, and, price, freezes, though, the, democratic, majorities, knowing, nixon, had, opposed, such, controls, throughout, his, career, did, not, expect, nixon, to, actually, use, the, authority, with, inflation, unresolved, by, august, 1971, and, an, election, year, looming, nixon, convened, a, summit, of, his, economic, advisers, at, camp, david, nixon, s, options, were, to, limit, fiscal, and, monetary, expansionist, policies, that, reduced, unemployment, or, end, the, dollar, s, fixed, exchange, rate, nixon, s, dilemma, has, been, cited, as, an, example, of, the, impossible, trinity, in, international, economics, he, then, announced, temporary, wage, and, price, controls, allowed, the, dollar, to, float, against, other, currencies, and, ended, the, convertibility, of, the, dollar, into, gold, bowles, points, out, by, identifying, himself, with, a, policy, whose, purpose, was, inflation, s, defeat, nixon, made, it, difficult, for, democratic, opponents, to, criticize, him, his, opponents, could, offer, no, alternative, policy, that, was, either, plausible, or, believable, since, the, one, they, favored, was, one, they, had, designed, but, which, the, president, had, appropriated, for, himself, nixon, s, policies, dampened, inflation, through, 1972, although, their, aftereffects, contributed, to, inflation, during, his, second, term, and, into, the, ford, administration, nixon, s, decision, to, end, the, gold, standard, in, the, united, states, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, bretton, woods, system, according, to, thomas, oatley, the, bretton, woods, system, collapsed, so, that, nixon, might, win, the, 1972, presidential, election, after, nixon, won, re, election, inflation, was, returning, he, reimposed, price, controls, in, june, 1973, the, price, controls, became, unpopular, with, the, public, and, businesspeople, who, saw, powerful, labor, unions, as, preferable, to, the, price, board, bureaucracy, the, controls, produced, food, shortages, as, meat, disappeared, from, grocery, stores, and, farmers, drowned, chickens, rather, than, sell, them, at, a, loss, despite, the, failure, to, control, inflation, controls, were, slowly, ended, and, on, april, 30, 1974, their, statutory, authorization, lapsed, nixon, advocated, a, new, federalism, which, would, devolve, power, to, state, and, local, elected, officials, though, congress, was, hostile, to, these, ideas, and, enacted, few, of, them, he, eliminated, the, cabinet, level, united, states, post, office, department, which, in, 1971, became, the, government, run, united, states, postal, service, nixon, was, a, late, supporter, of, the, conservation, movement, environmental, policy, had, not, been, a, significant, issue, in, the, 1968, election, and, the, candidates, were, rarely, asked, for, their, views, on, the, subject, nixon, broke, new, ground, by, discussing, environmental, policy, in, his, state, of, the, union, speech, in, 1970, he, saw, that, the, first, earth, day, in, april, 1970, presaged, a, wave, of, voter, interest, on, the, subject, and, sought, to, use, that, to, his, benefit, in, june, he, announced, the, formation, of, the, environmental, protection, agency, epa, he, relied, on, his, domestic, advisor, john, ehrlichman, who, favored, protection, of, natural, resources, to, keep, him, out, of, trouble, on, environmental, issues, other, initiatives, supported, by, nixon, included, the, clean, air, act, of, 1970, and, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, and, the, national, environmental, policy, act, required, environmental, impact, statements, for, many, federal, projects, nixon, vetoed, the, clean, water, act, of, 1972, objecting, not, to, the, policy, goals, of, the, legislation, but, to, the, amount, of, money, to, be, spent, on, them, which, he, deemed, excessive, after, congress, overrode, his, veto, nixon, impounded, the, funds, he, deemed, unjustifiable, in, 1971, nixon, proposed, health, insurance, reform, a, private, health, insurance, employer, mandate, federalization, of, medicaid, for, poor, families, with, dependent, minor, children, and, support, for, health, maintenance, organizations, hmos, a, limited, hmo, bill, was, enacted, in, 1973, in, 1974, nixon, proposed, more, comprehensive, health, insurance, reform, a, private, health, insurance, employer, mandate, and, replacement, of, medicaid, by, state, run, health, insurance, plans, available, to, all, with, income, based, premiums, and, cost, sharing, nixon, was, concerned, about, the, prevalence, of, domestic, drug, use, in, addition, to, drug, use, among, american, soldiers, in, vietnam, he, called, for, a, war, on, drugs, and, pledged, to, cut, off, sources, of, supply, abroad, he, also, increased, funds, for, education, and, for, rehabilitation, facilities, as, one, policy, initiative, nixon, called, for, more, money, for, sickle, cell, research, treatment, and, education, in, february, 1971, and, signed, the, national, sickle, cell, anemia, control, act, on, may, 16, 1972, while, nixon, called, for, increased, spending, on, such, high, profile, items, as, sickle, cell, disease, and, for, a, war, on, cancer, at, the, same, time, he, sought, to, reduce, overall, spending, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, the, nixon, presidency, witnessed, the, first, large, scale, integration, of, public, schools, in, the, south, nixon, sought, a, middle, way, between, the, segregationist, wallace, and, liberal, democrats, whose, support, of, integration, was, alienating, some, southern, whites, hopeful, of, doing, well, in, the, south, in, 1972, he, sought, to, dispose, of, desegregation, as, a, political, issue, before, then, soon, after, his, inauguration, he, appointed, vice, president, agnew, to, lead, a, task, force, which, worked, with, local, leaders, both, white, and, black, to, determine, how, to, integrate, local, schools, agnew, had, little, interest, in, the, work, and, most, of, it, was, done, by, labor, secretary, george, shultz, federal, aid, was, available, and, a, meeting, with, president, nixon, was, a, possible, reward, for, compliant, committees, by, september, 1970, less, than, ten, percent, of, black, children, were, attending, segregated, schools, by, 1971, however, tensions, over, desegregation, surfaced, in, northern, cities, with, angry, protests, over, the, busing, of, children, to, schools, outside, their, neighborhood, to, achieve, racial, balance, nixon, opposed, busing, personally, but, enforced, court, orders, requiring, its, use, some, scholars, such, as, james, morton, turner, and, john, isenberg, believe, that, nixon, who, had, advocated, for, civil, rights, in, his, 1960, campaign, slowed, down, desegregation, as, president, appealing, to, the, racial, conservatism, of, southern, whites, who, were, angered, by, the, civil, rights, movement, this, he, hoped, would, boost, his, election, chances, in, 1972, in, addition, to, desegregating, public, schools, nixon, implemented, the, philadelphia, plan, in, 1970, the, first, significant, federal, affirmative, action, program, he, also, endorsed, the, equal, rights, amendment, after, it, passed, both, houses, of, congress, in, 1972, and, went, to, the, states, for, ratification, he, also, pushed, for, african, american, civil, rights, and, economic, equity, through, a, concept, known, as, black, capitalism, nixon, had, campaigned, as, an, era, supporter, in, 1968, though, feminists, criticized, him, for, doing, little, to, help, the, era, or, their, cause, after, his, election, nevertheless, he, appointed, more, women, to, administration, positions, than, lyndon, johnson, had, after, a, nearly, decade, long, national, effort, the, united, states, won, the, race, to, land, astronauts, on, the, moon, on, july, 20, 1969, with, the, flight, of, apollo, 11, nixon, spoke, with, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, during, their, moonwalk, he, called, the, conversation, the, most, historic, phone, call, ever, made, from, the, white, house, nixon, was, unwilling, to, keep, funding, for, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, at, the, high, level, seen, during, the, 1960s, as, nasa, prepared, to, send, men, to, the, moon, nasa, administrator, thomas, o, paine, drew, up, ambitious, plans, for, the, establishment, of, a, permanent, base, on, the, moon, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, and, the, launch, of, a, crewed, expedition, to, mars, as, early, as, 1981, nixon, rejected, both, proposals, due, to, the, expense, nixon, also, canceled, the, air, force, manned, orbital, laboratory, program, in, 1969, because, uncrewed, spy, satellites, were, a, more, cost, effective, way, to, achieve, the, same, reconnaissance, objective, nasa, cancelled, the, last, three, planned, apollo, lunar, missions, to, place, skylab, in, orbit, more, efficiently, and, free, money, up, for, the, design, and, construction, of, the, space, shuttle, on, may, 24, 1972, nixon, approved, a, five, year, cooperative, program, between, nasa, and, the, soviet, space, program, culminating, in, the, 1975, joint, mission, of, an, american, apollo, and, soviet, soyuz, spacecraft, linking, in, space, nixon, believed, his, rise, to, power, had, peaked, at, a, moment, of, political, realignment, the, democratic, solid, south, had, long, been, a, source, of, frustration, to, republican, ambitions, goldwater, had, won, several, southern, states, by, opposing, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, but, had, alienated, more, moderate, southerners, nixon, s, efforts, to, gain, southern, support, in, 1968, were, diluted, by, wallace, s, candidacy, through, his, first, term, he, pursued, a, southern, strategy, with, policies, such, as, his, desegregation, plans, that, would, be, broadly, acceptable, among, southern, whites, encouraging, them, to, realign, with, the, republicans, in, the, aftermath, of, the, civil, rights, movement, he, nominated, two, southern, conservatives, clement, haynsworth, and, g, harrold, carswell, to, the, supreme, court, but, neither, was, confirmed, by, the, senate, nixon, entered, his, name, on, the, new, hampshire, primary, ballot, on, january, 5, 1972, effectively, announcing, his, candidacy, for, reelection, virtually, assured, the, republican, nomination, the, president, had, initially, expected, his, democratic, opponent, to, be, massachusetts, senator, edward, m, kennedy, brother, of, the, late, president, who, was, largely, removed, from, contention, after, the, july, 1969, chappaquiddick, incident, instead, maine, senator, edmund, muskie, became, the, front, runner, with, south, dakota, senator, george, mcgovern, in, a, close, second, place, on, june, 10, mcgovern, won, the, california, primary, and, secured, the, democratic, nomination, the, following, month, nixon, was, renominated, at, the, 1972, republican, national, convention, he, dismissed, the, democratic, platform, as, cowardly, and, divisive, mcgovern, intended, to, sharply, reduce, defense, spending, and, supported, amnesty, for, draft, evaders, as, well, as, abortion, rights, with, some, of, his, supporters, believed, to, be, in, favor, of, drug, legalization, mcgovern, was, perceived, as, standing, for, amnesty, abortion, and, acid, mcgovern, was, also, damaged, by, his, vacillating, support, for, his, original, running, mate, missouri, senator, thomas, eagleton, dumped, from, the, ticket, following, revelations, that, he, had, received, electroshock, treatment, for, depression, nixon, was, ahead, in, most, polls, for, the, entire, election, cycle, and, was, reelected, on, november, 7, 1972, in, one, of, the, largest, landslide, election, victories, in, american, history, he, defeated, mcgovern, with, over, 60, percent, of, the, popular, vote, losing, only, in, massachusetts, and, d, c, the, term, watergate, has, come, to, encompass, an, array, of, clandestine, and, often, illegal, activities, undertaken, by, members, of, the, nixon, administration, those, activities, included, dirty, tricks, such, as, bugging, the, offices, of, political, opponents, and, the, harassment, of, activist, groups, and, political, figures, the, activities, were, brought, to, light, after, five, men, were, caught, breaking, into, the, democratic, party, headquarters, at, the, watergate, complex, in, washington, d, c, on, june, 17, 1972, the, washington, post, picked, up, on, the, story, reporters, carl, bernstein, and, bob, woodward, relied, on, an, informant, known, as, deep, throat, later, revealed, to, be, mark, felt, associate, director, at, the, fbi, to, link, the, men, to, the, nixon, administration, nixon, downplayed, the, scandal, as, mere, politics, calling, news, articles, biased, and, misleading, a, series, of, revelations, made, it, clear, that, the, committee, to, re, elect, president, nixon, and, later, the, white, house, were, involved, in, attempts, to, sabotage, the, democrats, senior, aides, such, as, white, house, counsel, john, dean, faced, prosecution, in, total, 48, officials, were, convicted, of, wrongdoing, in, july, 1973, white, house, aide, alexander, butterfield, testified, under, oath, to, congress, that, nixon, had, a, secret, taping, system, and, recorded, his, conversations, and, phone, calls, in, the, oval, office, these, tapes, were, subpoenaed, by, watergate, special, counsel, archibald, cox, nixon, provided, transcripts, of, the, conversations, but, not, the, actual, tapes, citing, executive, privilege, with, the, white, house, and, cox, at, loggerheads, nixon, had, cox, fired, in, october, in, the, saturday, night, massacre,

rose, mary, woods, the, president, s, personal, secretary, claimed, responsibility, for, the, gap, saying, that, she, had, accidentally, wiped, the, section, while, transcribing, the, tape, but, her, story, was, widely, mocked, the, gap, while, not, conclusive, proof, of, wrongdoing, by, the, president, cast, doubt, on, nixon, s, statement, that, he, had, been, unaware, of, the, cover, up, though, nixon, lost, much, popular, support, even, from, his, own, party, he, rejected, accusations, of, wrongdoing, and, vowed, to, stay, in, office, he, admitted, he, had, made, mistakes, but, insisted, he, had, no, prior, knowledge, of, the, burglary, did, not, break, any, laws, and, did, not, learn, of, the, cover, up, until, early, 1973, on, october, 10, 1973, vice, president, agnew, resigned, for, reasons, unrelated, to, watergate, he, was, convicted, on, charges, of, bribery, tax, evasion, and, money, laundering, during, his, tenure, as, governor, of, maryland, believing, his, first, choice, john, connally, would, not, be, confirmed, by, congress, nixon, chose, gerald, ford, minority, leader, of, the, house, of, representatives, to, replace, agnew, one, researcher, suggests, nixon, effectively, disengaged, from, his, own, administration, after, ford, was, sworn, in, as, vice, president, on, december, 6, 1973, on, november, 17, 1973, during, a, televised, question, and, answer,

everything, i, ve, got, the, legal, battle, over, the, tapes, continued, through, early, 1974, and, in, april, nixon, announced, the, release, of, 1, 200, pages, of, transcripts, of, white, house, conversations, between, himself, and, his, aides, the, house, judiciary, committee, opened, impeachment, hearings, against, the, president, on, may, 9, 1974, which, were, televised, on, the, major, tv, networks, these, hearings, culminated, in, votes, for, impeachment, on, july, 24, the, supreme, court, ruled, unanimously, that, the, full, tapes, not, just, selected, transcripts, must, be, released, the, scandal, grew, to, involve, a, slew, of, additional, allegations, against, the, president, ranging, from, the, improper, use, of, government, agencies, to, accepting, gifts, in, office, and, his, personal, finances, and, taxes, nixon, repeatedly, stated, his, willingness, to, pay, any, outstanding, taxes, due, and, later, paid, 465, 000, equivalent, to, 2, 9, million, in, 2023, in, back, taxes, in, 1974, even, with, support, diminished, by, the, continuing, series, of, revelations, nixon, hoped, to, fight, the, charges, but, one, of, the, new, tapes, recorded, soon, after, the, break, in, demonstrated, that, nixon, had, been, told, of, the, white, house, connection, to, the, watergate, burglaries, soon, after, they, took, place, and, had, approved, plans, to, thwart, the, investigation, in, a, statement, accompanying, the, release, of, what, became, known, as, the, smoking, gun, tape, on, august, 5, 1974, nixon, accepted, blame, for, misleading, the, country, about, when, he, had, been, told, of, white, house, involvement, stating, that, he, had, had, a, lapse, of, memory, senate, minority, leader, hugh, scott, senator, barry, goldwater, and, house, minority, leader, john, jacob, rhodes, met, with, nixon, soon, after, rhodes, told, nixon, he, faced, certain, impeachment, in, the, house, scott, and, goldwater, told, the, president, that, he, had, at, most, only, 15, votes, in, his, favor, in, the, senate, far, fewer, than, the, 34, needed, to, avoid, removal, from, office, in, light, of, his, loss, of, political, support, and, the, near, certainty, that, he, would, be, impeached, and, removed, from, office, nixon, resigned, the, presidency, on, august, 9, 1974, after, addressing, the, nation, on, television, the, previous, evening, the, resignation, speech, was, delivered, from, the, oval, office, and, was, carried, live, on, radio, and, television, nixon, said, he, was, resigning, for, the, good, of, the, country, and, asked, the, nation, to, support, the, new, president, gerald, ford, nixon, went, on, to, review, the, accomplishments, of, his, presidency, especially, in, foreign, policy, he, defended, his, record, as, president, quoting, from, theodore, roosevelt, s, 1910, speech, citizenship, in, a, republic, sometimes, i, have, succeeded, and, sometimes, i, have, failed, but, always, i, have, taken, heart, from, what, theodore, roosevelt, once, said, about, the, man, in, the, arena, whose, face, is, marred, by, dust, and, sweat, and, blood, who, strives, valiantly, who, errs, and, comes, up, short, again, and, again, because, there, is, not, effort, without, error, and, shortcoming, but, who, does, actually, strive, to, do, the, deed, who, knows, the, great, enthusiasms, the, great, devotions, who, spends, himself, in, a, worthy, cause, who, at, the, best, knows, in, the, end, the, triumphs, of, high, achievements, and, who, at, the, worst, if, he, fails, at, least, fails, while, daring, greatly, nixon, s, speech, received, generally, favorable, initial, responses, from, network, commentators, with, only, roger, mudd, of, cbs, stating, that, nixon, had, not, admitted, wrongdoing, it, was, termed, a, masterpiece, by, conrad, black, one, of, his, biographers, black, opined, that, what, was, intended, to, be, an, unprecedented, humiliation, for, any, american, president, nixon, converted, into, a, virtual, parliamentary, acknowledgement, of, almost, blameless, insufficiency, of, legislative, support, to, continue, he, left, while, devoting, half, his, address, to, a, recitation, of, his, accomplishments, in, office, following, his, resignation, the, nixons, flew, to, their, home, la, casa, pacifica, in, san, clemente, california, according, to, his, biographer, jonathan, aitken, nixon, was, a, soul, in, torment, after, his, resignation, congress, had, funded, nixon, s, transition, costs, including, some, salary, expenses, though, reducing, the, appropriation, from, 850, 000, to, 200, 000, with, some, of, his, staff, still, with, him, nixon, was, at, his, desk, by, 7, 00, a, m, with, little, to, do, his, former, press, secretary, ron, ziegler, sat, with, him, alone, for, hours, each, day, nixon, s, resignation, had, not, put, an, end, to, the, desire, among, many, to, see, him, punished, the, ford, white, house, considered, a, pardon, of, nixon, even, though, it, would, be, unpopular, in, the, country, nixon, contacted, by, ford, emissaries, was, initially, reluctant, to, accept, the, pardon, but, then, agreed, to, do, so, ford, insisted, on, a, statement, of, contrition, but, nixon, felt, he, had, not, committed, any, crimes, and, should, not, have, to, issue, such, a, document, ford, eventually, agreed, and, on, september, 8, 1974, he, granted, nixon, a, full, free, and, absolute, pardon, which, ended, any, possibility, of, an, indictment, nixon, then, released, a, statement, i, was, wrong, in, not, acting, more, decisively, and, more, forthrightly, in, dealing, with, watergate, particularly, when, it, reached, the, stage, of, judicial, proceedings, and, grew, from, a, political, scandal, into, a, national, tragedy, no, words, can, describe, the, depth, of, my, regret, and, pain, at, the, anguish, my, mistakes, over, watergate, have, caused, the, nation, and, the, presidency, a, nation, i, so, deeply, love, and, an, institution, i, so, greatly, respect, in, october, 1974, nixon, fell, ill, with, phlebitis, told, by, his, doctors, that, he, could, either, be, operated, on, or, die, a, reluctant, nixon, chose, surgery, and, president, ford, visited, him, in, the, hospital, nixon, was, under, subpoena, for, the, trial, of, three, of, his, former, aides, dean, haldeman, and, john, ehrlichman, and, the, washington, post, disbelieving, his, illness, printed, a, cartoon, showing, nixon, with, a, cast, on, the, wrong, foot, judge, john, sirica, excused, nixon, s, presence, despite, the, defendants, objections, congress, instructed, ford, to, retain, nixon, s, presidential, papers, beginning, a, three, decade, legal, battle, over, the, documents, that, was, eventually, won, by, the, former, president, and, his, estate, nixon, was, in, the, hospital, when, the, 1974, midterm, elections, were, held, and, watergate, and, the, pardon, were, contributing, factors, to, the, republican, loss, of, 49, seats, in, the, house, and, four, in, the, senate, in, december, 1974, nixon, began, planning, his, comeback, despite, the, considerable, ill, will, against, him, in, the, country, he, wrote, in, his, diary, referring, to, himself, and, pat, so, be, it, we, will, see, it, through, we, ve, had, tough, times, before, and, we, can, take, the, tougher, ones, that, we, will, have, to, go, through, now, that, is, perhaps, what, we, were, made, for, to, be, able, to, take, punishment, beyond, what, anyone, in, this, office, has, had, before, particularly, after, leaving, office, this, is, a, test, of, character, and, we, must, not, fail, the, test, by, early, 1975, nixon, s, health, was, improving, he, maintained, an, office, in, a, coast, guard, station, 300, yards, 270, m, from, his, home, at, first, taking, a, golf, cart, and, later, walking, the, route, each, day, he, mainly, worked, on, his, memoirs, he, had, hoped, to, wait, before, writing, his, memoirs, the, fact, that, his, assets, were, being, eaten, away, by, expenses, and, lawyer, fees, compelled, him, to, begin, work, quickly, he, was, handicapped, in, this, work, by, the, end, of, his, transition, allowance, in, february, which, compelled, him, to, part, with, many, of, his, staff, including, ziegler, in, august, of, that, year, he, met, with, british, talk, show, host, and, producer, david, frost, who, paid, him, 600, 000, equivalent, to, 3, 4, million, in, 2023, for, a, series, of, sit, down, interviews, filmed, and, aired, in, 1977, they, began, on, the, topic, of, foreign, policy, recounting, the, leaders, he, had, known, but, the, most, remembered, section, of, the, interviews, was, that, on, watergate, nixon, admitted, he, had, let, down, the, country, and, that, i, brought, myself, down, i, gave, them, a, sword, and, they, stuck, it, in, and, they, twisted, it, with, relish, and, i, guess, if, i, d, been, in, their, position, i, d, have, done, the, same, thing, the, interviews, garnered, 45, 50, million, viewers, becoming, the, most, watched, program, of, its, kind, in, television, history, the, interviews, helped, improve, nixon, s, financial, position, at, one, point, in, early, 1975, he, had, only, 500, in, the, bank, as, did, the, sale, of, his, key, biscayne, property, to, a, trust, set, up, by, wealthy, friends, of, nixon, such, as, bebe, rebozo, in, february, 1976, nixon, visited, china, at, the, personal, invitation, of, mao, nixon, had, wanted, to, return, to, china, but, chose, to, wait, until, after, ford, s, own, visit, in, 1975, nixon, remained, neutral, in, the, close, 1976, primary, battle, between, ford, and, reagan, ford, won, but, was, defeated, by, georgia, governor, jimmy, carter, in, the, general, election, the, carter, administration, had, little, use, for, nixon, and, blocked, his, planned, trip, to, australia, causing, the, government, of, prime, minister, malcolm, fraser, to, withhold, its, official, invitation, in, 1976, nixon, was, disbarred, by, the, new, york, state, bar, association, for, obstruction, of, justice, in, the, watergate, affair, he, chose, not, to, present, any, defense, in,

macmillan, and, edward, heath, he, was, welcomed, however, by, the, leader, of, the, opposition, margaret, thatcher, and, former, prime, ministers, lord, home, and, sir, harold, wilson, nixon, addressed, the, oxford, union, regarding, watergate, felt, that, on, this, matter, that, i, had, not, handled, it, properly, and, they, were, right, i, screwed, it, up, and, i, paid, the, price, in, 1978, nixon, published, his, memoirs, rn, the, memoirs, of, richard, nixon, the, first, of, nine, books, he, was, to, author, in, his, retirement, john, a, farrell, deemed, it, one, of, the, better, presidential, memoirs, candid, and, capturing, its, author, s, voice, he, deemed, its, rise, up, the, bestseller, lists, justified, nixon, visited, the, white, house, in, 1979, invited, by, carter, for, the, state, dinner, for, chinese, vice, premier, deng, xiaoping, carter, had, not, wanted, to, invite, nixon, but, deng, had, said, he, would, visit, nixon, in, california, if, the, former,

he, kept, traveling, and, thinking, and, talking, to, the, world, s, leaders, and, by, the, time, bill, clinton, came, to, the, white, house, nixon, had, virtually, cemented, his, role, as, an, elder,

wrote, richard, nixon, s, jowly, beard, shadowed, face, the, ski, jump, nose, and, the, widow, s, peak, the, arms, upstretched, in, the, v, sign, had, been, so, often, pictured, and, caricatured, his, presence, had, become, such, a, familiar, one, in, the, land, he, had, been, so, often, in, the, heat, of, controversy, that, it, was, hard, to, realize, the, nation, really, would, not, have, nixon, to, kick, around, anymore, ambrose, said, of, the, reaction, to, nixon, s, death, to, everyone, s, amazement, except, his, he, s, our, beloved, elder, statesman, upon, nixon, s, death, the, news, coverage, mentioned, watergate, and, the, resignation, but, much, of, the, coverage, was, favorable, to, the, former, president, the, dallas, morning, news, stated, history, ultimately, should, show, that, despite, his, flaws, he, was, one, of, our, most, farsighted, chief, executives, this, offended, some, columnist, russell, baker, complained, of, a, group, conspiracy, to, grant, him, absolution, cartoonist, jeff, koterba, of, the, omaha, world, herald, depicted, history, before, a, blank, canvas, his, subject, nixon, as, america, looks, on, eagerly, the, artist, urges, his, audience, to, sit, down, the, work, will, take, some, time, to, complete, as, this, portrait, is, a, little, more, complicated, than, most, hunter, s, thompson, wrote, a, scathing, piece, denouncing, nixon, for, rolling, stone, entitled, he, was, a, crook, which, also, appeared, a, month, later, in, the, atlantic, in, his, article, thompson, described, nixon, as, a, political, monster, straight, out, of, grendel, and, a, very, dangerous, enemy, historian, and, political, scientist, james, macgregor, burns, asked, of, nixon, how, can, one, evaluate, such, an, idiosyncratic, president, so, brilliant, and, so, morally, lacking, evaluations, of, his, presidency, have, proven, complex, contrasting, his, presidency, s, domestic, and, foreign, policy, successes, with, the, acrimonious, circumstances, of, his, departure, according, to, ambrose, nixon, wanted, to, be, judged, by, what, he, accomplished, what, he, will, be, remembered, for, is, the, nightmare, he, put, the, country, through, in, his, second, term, and, for, his, resignation, irwin, gellman, who, chronicled, nixon, s, congressional, career, suggests, he, was, remarkable, among, his, congressional, peers, a, success, story, in, a, troubled, era, one, who, steered, a, sensible, anti, communist, course, against, the, excess, of, mccarthy, aitken, feels, that, nixon, both, as, a, man, and, as, a, statesman, has, been, excessively, maligned, for, his, faults, and, inadequately, recognised, for, his, virtues, yet, even, in, a, spirit, of, historical, revisionism, no, simple, verdict, is, possible, nixon, saw, his, policies, on, vietnam, china, and, the, soviet, union, as, central, to, his, place, in, history, nixon, s, onetime, opponent, george, mcgovern, commented, in, 1983, president, nixon, probably, had, a, more, practical, approach, to, the, two, superpowers, china, and, the, soviet, union, than, any, other, president, since, world, war, ii, with, the, exception, of, his, inexcusable, continuation, of, the, war, in, vietnam, nixon, really, will, get, high, marks, in, history, political, scientist, jussi, hanhim, ki, disagrees, saying, that, nixon, s, diplomacy, was, merely, a, continuation, of, the, cold, war, policy, of, containment, by, diplomatic, rather, than, military, means, historian, christopher, andrew, concludes, that, nixon, was, a, great, statesman, on, the, world, stage, as, well, as, a, shabby, practitioner, of, electoral, politics, in, the, domestic, arena, while, the, criminal, farce, of, watergate, was, in, the, making, nixon, s, inspirational, statesmanship, was, establishing, new, working, relationships, both, with, communist, china, and, with, the, soviet, union, nixon, s, stance, on, domestic, affairs, has, been, credited, with, the, passage, and, enforcement, of, environmental, and, regulatory, legislation, in, a, 2011, paper, on, nixon, and, the, environment, historian, paul, charles, milazzo, points, to, nixon, s, creation, of, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, and, to, his, enforcement, of, legislation, such, as, the, 1973, endangered, species, act, stating, that, though, unsought, and, unacknowledged, richard, nixon, s, environmental, legacy, is, secure, nixon, himself, did, not, consider, the, environmental, advances, he, made, in, office, an, important, part, of, his, legacy, some, historians, contend, that, his, choices, were, driven, more, by, political, expediency, than, any, strong, environmentalism, some, historians, say, nixon, s, southern, strategy, turned, the, southern, united, states, into, a, republican, stronghold, while, others, deem, economic, factors, more, important, in, the, change, throughout, his, career, nixon, moved, his, party, away, from, the, control, of, isolationists, and, as, a, congressman, he, was, a, persuasive, advocate, of, containing, soviet, communism, historian, keith, w, olson, has, written, that, nixon, left, a, legacy, of, fundamental, mistrust, of, government, rooted, in, vietnam, and, watergate, during, the, impeachment, of, bill, clinton, in, 1998, both, sides, tried, to, use, nixon, and, watergate, to, their,
