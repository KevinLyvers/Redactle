as, le, grand, testament, have, traditionally, been, read, as, if, they, were, autobiographical, other, details, of, his, life, are, known, from, court, or, other, civil, documents, from, what, the, sources, tell, us, it, appears, that, villon, was, born, in, poverty, and, raised, by, a, foster, father, but, that, his, mother, was, still, living, when, her, son, was, thirty, years, old, the, surname, villon, the, poet, tells, us, is, the, name, he, adopted, from, his, foster, father, guillaume, de, villon, chaplain, in, the, collegiate, church, of, saint, beno, t, le, b, tourn, and, a, professor, of, canon, law, who, took, villon, into, his, house, fran, ois, describes, guillaume, de, villon, as, more, than, a, father, to, me, villon, became, a, student, in, arts, perhaps, at,

known, of, his, activities, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, 1910, 1911, says, attempts, have, been, made, in, the, usual, fashion, of, conjectural, biography, to, fill, up, the, gap, with, what, a, young, graduate, of, bohemian, tendencies, would, could, or, might, have, done, but, they, are, mainly, futile, on, 5, june, 1455, the, first, major, recorded, incident, of, his, life, occurred, while, in, the, rue, saint, jacques, in, the, company, of, a, priest, named, giles, and, a, girl, named, isabeau, he, met, a, breton, named, jean, le, hardi, a, master, of, arts, who, was, also, with, a, priest, philippe, chermoye, or, sermoise, or, sermaise, a, scuffle, broke, out, and, daggers, were, drawn, sermaise, who, is, accused, of, having, threatened, and, attacked,

sentenced, to, banishment, a, sentence, which, was, remitted, in, january, 1456, by, a, pardon, from, king, charles, vii, after, he, received, the, second, of, two, petitions, which, made, the, claim, that, sermaise, had, forgiven, villon, before, he, died, two, different, versions, of, the, formal, pardon, exist, in, one, the, culprit, is, identified, as, fran, ois, des, loges, autrement, dit, villon, fran, ois, des, loges, otherwise, called, villon, in, the, other, as, fran, ois, de, montcorbier, he, is, also, said, to, have, named, himself, to, the, barber, surgeon, who, dressed, his, wounds, as, michel, mouton, the, documents, of, this, affair, at, least, confirm, the, date, of, his, birth, by, presenting, him, as, twenty, six, years, old, or, thereabouts, around, christmas, 1456, the, chapel, of, the, coll, ge, de, navarre, was, broken, open, and, five, hundred, gold, crowns, stolen, villon, was, involved, in, the, robbery, many, scholars, believe, that, he, fled, from, paris, soon, afterward, and, that, this, is, when, he, composed, what, is, now, known, as, the, le, petit, testament, the, smaller, testament, or, le, lais, legacy, or, bequests, the, robbery, was, not, discovered, until, march, of, the, next, year, and, it, was, not, until, may, that, the, police, came, on, the, track, of, a, gang, of, student, robbers, owing, to, the, indiscretion, of, one, of, them, guy, tabarie, a, year, more, passed, when, tabarie, after, being, arrested, turned, king, s, evidence, and, accused, the, absent, villon, of, being, the, ringleader, and, of, having, gone, to, angers, partly, at, least, to, arrange, similar, burglaries, there, villon, for, either, this, or, another, crime, was, sentenced, to, banishment, he, did, not, attempt, to, return, to, paris, for, four, years, he, was, a, wanderer, he, may, have, been, as, his, friends, regnier, de, montigny, and, colin, des, cayeux, were, a, member, of, a, wandering, gang, of, thieves, the, next, date, for, which, there, are, recorded, whereabouts, for, villon, is, the, summer, of, 1461, villon, wrote, that, he, spent, that, summer, in, the, bishop, s, prison, at, meung, sur, loire, his, crime, is, not, known, but, in, le, testament, the, testament, dated, that, year, he, inveighs, bitterly, against, bishop, thibault, d, aussigny, who, held, the, see, of, orl, ans, villon, may, have, been, released, as, part, of, a, general, jail, delivery, at, the, accession, of, king, louis, xi, and, became, a, free, man, again, on, 2, october, 1461, in, 1461, he, wrote, his, most, famous, work, le, testament, or, le, grand, testament, as, it, is, also, known, in, the, autumn, of, 1462, he, was, once, more, living, in, the, cloisters, of, saint, beno, t, in, november, 1462, villon, was, imprisoned, for, theft, he, was, taken, to, the, grand, ch, telet, fortress, that, stood, at, what, is, now, place, du, ch, telet, in, paris, in, default, of, evidence, the, old, charge, of, burgling, the, college, of, navarre, was, revived, no, royal, pardon, arrived, to, counter, the, demand, for, restitution, but, bail, was, accepted, and, villon, was, released, however, he, fell, promptly, into, a, street, quarrel, he, was, arrested, tortured, and, condemned, to, be, hanged, pendu, et, trangl, although, the, sentence, was, commuted, to, banishment, by, the, parlement, on, 5, january, 1463, villon, s, fate, after, january, 1463, is, unknown, rabelais, retells, two, stories, about, him, which, are, usually, dismissed, as, without, any, basis, in, fact, anthony, bonner, speculated, that, the, poet, as, he, left, paris, was, broken, in, health, and, spirit, bonner, writes, further, he, might, have, died, on, a, mat, of, straw, in, some, cheap, tavern, or, in, a, cold, dank, cell, or, in, a, fight, in, some, dark, street, with, another, french, coquillard, or, perhaps, as, he, always, feared, on, a, gallows, in, a, little, town, in, france, we, will, probably, never, know, le, petit, testament, also, known, as, le, lais, was, written, in, late, 1456, the, work, is, an, ironic, comic, poem, that, serves, as, villon, s, will, listing, bequests, to, his, friends, and, acquaintances, in, 1461, at, the, age, of, thirty, villon, composed, the, longer, work, which, came, to, be, known, as, le, grand, testament, 1461, 1462, this, has, generally, been, judged, villon, s, greatest, work, and, there, is, evidence, in, the, work, itself, that, villon, felt, the, same, besides, le, lais, and, le, grand, testament, villon, s, surviving, works, include, multiple, poems, sixteen, of, these, shorter, poems, vary, from, the, serious, to, the, light, hearted, an, additional, eleven, poems, in, thieves, jargon, were, attributed, to, villon, from, a, very, early, time, but, many, scholars, now, believe, them, to, be, the, work, of, other, poets, imitating, villon, villon, was, a, great, innovator, in, terms, of, the, themes, of, poetry, and, through, these, themes, a, great, renovator, of, the, forms, he, understood, perfectly, the, medieval, courtly, ideal, but, he, often, chose, to, write, against, the, grain, reversing, the, values, and, celebrating, the, lowlifes, destined, for, the, gallows, falling, happily, into, parody, or, lewd, jokes, and, constantly, innovating, in, his, diction, and, vocabulary, a, few, minor, poems, make, extensive, use, of, parisian, thieves, slang, still, villon, s, verse, is, mostly, about, his, own, life, a, record, of, poverty, trouble, and, trial, which, was, certainly, shared, by, his, poems, intended, audience, villon, s, poems, are, sprinkled, with, mysteries, and, hidden, jokes, they, are, peppered, with, the, slang, of, the, time, and, the, underworld, subculture, in, which, villon, moved, his, works, are, also, replete, with, private, jokes, and, full, of, the, names, of, real, people, rich, men, royal, officials, lawyers, prostitutes, and, policemen, from, medieval, paris, george, heyer, 1869, 1925, father, of, novelist, georgette, heyer, published, a, translation, in, 1924, oxford, university, press, brought, out, the, retrospect, of, francois, villon, being, a, rendering, into, english, verse, of, huitains, i, to, xli, of, le, testament, and, of, the, three, ballades, to, which, they, lead, transl, george, heyer, london, 1924, on, 25, december, 1924, it, was, reviewed, in, the, times, literary, supplement, p, 886, and, the, review, began, it, is, a, little, unfortunate, that, this, translation, of, villon, should, appear, only, a, few, months, after, the, excellent, rendering, made, by, mr, j, heron, lepper, mr, heyer, s, work, is, very, nearly, as, good, however, he, makes, happy, use, of, quaint, words, and, archaic, idioms, and, preserves, with, admirable, skill, the, lyrical, vigour, of, villon, s, huitains, it, is, interesting, to, compare, his, version, with, mr, lepper, s, both, maintain, a, scholarly, fidelity, to, the, original, but, one, notes, with, a, certain, degree, of, surprise, the, extraordinary, difference, which, they, yet, show, george, heyer, was, a, fluent, and, idiomatic, french, speaker, and, the, french, and, english, are, printed, on, opposite, pages, the, book, also, contains, a, number, of, historical, and, literary, notes, john, heron, lepper, published, a, translation, in, 1924, another, translation, is, one, by, anthony, bonner, published, in, 1960, one, drawback, common, to, these, english, older, translations, is, that, they, are, all, based, on, old, editions, of, villon, s, texts, that, is, the, french, text, that, they, translate, the, longnon, foulet, edition, of, 1932, is, a, text, established, by, scholars, some, 80, years, ago, a, translation, by, the, american, poet, galway, kinnell, 1965, contains, most, of, villon, s, works, but, lacks, six, shorter, poems, of, disputed, provenance, peter, dale, s, verse, translation, 1974, follows, the, poet, s, rhyme, scheme, barbara, sargent, baur, s, complete, works, translation, 1994, includes, 11, poems, long, attributed, to, villon, but, possibly, the, work, of, a, medieval, imitator, a, new, english, translation, by, david, georgi, came, out, in, 2013, the, book, also, includes, villon, s, french, printed, across, from, the, english, notes, in, the, back, provide, a, wealth, of, information, about, the, poems, and, about, medieval, paris, more, than, any, translation, georgi, s, emphasizes, villon, s, famous, gallows, humor, his, word, play, jokes, and, puns, translations, of, three, villon, poems, were, made, in, 1867, by, dante, gabriel, rossetti, these, three, poems, were, central, texts, to, rossetti, s, 1870, book, of, poems, which, explored, themes, from, the, far, past, mid, past, and, modern, time, rossetti, used, the, ballad, of, dead, ladies, to, death, of, his, lady, and, his, mother, s, service, to, our, lady, w, e, henley, while, editing, slang, and, its, analogues, translated, two, ballades, into, english, criminal, slang, as,

translated, many, of, villon, s, most, famous, ballades, in, collected, poems, 1943, 2004, the, phrase, where, are, the, snows, of, yester, year, is, one, of, the, most, famous, lines, of, translated, poetry, in, the, english, speaking, world, it, is, the, refrain, in, the, ballad, of, dead, ladies, dante, gabriel, rossetti, s, translation, of, villon, s, 1461, ballade, des, dames, du, temps,

popularity, in, the, decades, after, they, were, written, in, 1489, a, printed, volume, of, his, poems, was, published, by, pierre, levet, this, edition, was, almost, immediately, followed, by, several, others, in, 1533, poet, and, humanist, scholar, cl, ment, marot, published, an, important, edition, in, which, he, recognized, villon, as, one, of, the, most, significant, poets, in, french,
