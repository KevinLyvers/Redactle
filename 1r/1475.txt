old, in, july, 1824, he, was, named, a, page, to, charles, albert, the, king, of, piedmont, 1831, 1849, cavour, frequently, ran, afoul, of, the, authorities, in, the, academy, as, he, was, too, headstrong, to, deal, with, the, rigid, military, discipline, he, was, once, forced, to, live, three, days, on, bread, and, water, because, he, had, been, caught, with, books, that, the, academy, had, banned, he, was, found, to, be, apt, at, the, mathematical, disciplines, and, was, therefore, enlisted, in, the, engineer, corps, in, the, royal, sardinian, army, in, 1827, while, in, the, army, he, studied, the, english, language, as, well, as, the, works, of, jeremy, bentham, and, benjamin, constant, developing, liberal, tendencies, which, made, him, suspect, to, police, forces, at, the, time, he, resigned, his, commission, in, the, army, in, november, 1831, both, because, of, boredom, with, military, life, and, because, of, his, dislike, of, the, reactionary, policies, of, king, charles, albert, he, administered, the, family, estate, at, grinzane, some, forty, kilometres, outside, the, capital, serving, as, mayor, there, from, 1832, to, the, revolutionary, upheaval, of, 1848, cavour, then, lived, for, a, time, in, switzerland, with, his, relatives, in, geneva, he, then, travelled, to, paris, where, he, was, impressed, by, parliamentary, debates, especially, those, of, fran, ois, guizot, and, adolphe, thiers, confirming, his, devotion, to, a, political, career, he, next, went, to, london, where, he, was, much, more, disappointed, by, british, politics, and, toured, the, country, visiting, oxford, liverpool, birmingham, chester, nottingham, and, manchester, a, quick, tour, through, the, netherlands, germany, and, switzerland, the, german, part, and, the, lake, geneva, area, eventually, landed, him, back, in, turin, cavour, believed, that, economic, progress, had, to, precede, political, change, and, stressed, the, advantages, of, railroad, construction, in, the, peninsula, he, was, a, strong, supporter, of, transportation, by, steam, engine, sponsoring, the, building, of, many, railroads, and, canals, between, 1838, and, 1842, cavour, began, several, initiatives, in, attempts, to, solve, economic, problems, in, his, area, he, experimented, with, different, agricultural, techniques, on, his, estate, such, as, growing, sugar, beets, and, was, one, of, the, first, italian, landowners, to, use, chemical, fertilizers, he, also, founded, the, piedmontese, agricultural, society, in, his, spare, time, he, again, travelled, extensively, mostly, in, france, and, the, united, kingdom, the, first, apparently, liberal, moves, of, pope, pius, ix, and, the, revolutions, of, 1848, spawned, a, new, movement, of, italian, liberalism, allowing, cavour, to, enter, the, political, arena, no, longer, in, fear, of, the, police, he, then, gave, a, speech, in, front, of, numerous, journalists, in, favour, of, a, constitution, for, piedmont, which, was, eventually, granted, cavour, unlike, several, other, political, thinkers, was, not, at, first, offered, a, position, in, the, new, chamber, of, deputies, as, he, was, still, a, somewhat, suspicious, character, to, the, nation, cavour, never, planned, for, the, establishment, of, a, united, country, and, even, later, during, his, premiership, his, objective, was, to, expand, piedmont, with, the, annexation, of, lombardy, and, venetia, rather, than, a, unified, italy, for, example, during, the, conservative, period, he, gained, a, reputation, as, a, non, revolutionary, progressive, he, was, a, poor, public, speaker, cavour, then, lost, the, next, election, while, the, piedmontese, army, was, destroyed, at, the, battle, of, novara, leading, charles, albert, to, abdicate, passing, the, throne, to, his, son, victor, emmanuel, ii, cavour, was, then, brought, back, into, parliament, by, the, voters, where, he, was, much, more, successful, his, knowledge, of, european, markets, and, modern, economics, earned, him, the, positions, of, minister, of, agriculture, minister, of, commerce, and, minister, of, the, navy, in, 1850, cavour, soon, came, to, dominate, the, cabinet, of, prime, minister, massimo, d, azeglio, cavour, united, the, right, center, and, the, left, center, in, the, chamber, to, show, dominance, there, as, well, in, 1851, cavour, gained, a, cabinet, promotion, to, minister, of, finance, by, working, against, his, colleague, from, inside, the, cabinet, in, a, somewhat, disreputable, takeover, although, this, was, to, piedmont, s, advantage, because, of, his, many, economic, reforms, it, allowed, cavour, to, begin, his, railway, expansion, program, giving, piedmont, 800, kilometres, of, track, by, the, year, 1860, one, third, of, the, railways, in, italy, at, the, time, he, took, the, lead, in, legislation, weakening, the, powers, of, the, church, to, own, land, control, the, schools, and, supervise, marriage, laws, when, the, bishops, protested, they, were, punished, or, exiled, making, cavour, the, hero, of, liberal, anticlerical, elements, across, italy, cavour, formed, a, coalition, with, urbano, rattazzi, known, as, the, connubio, marriage, uniting, the, moderate, men, of, the, right, and, of, the, left, and, brought, about, the, fall, of, the, d, azeglio, cabinet, in, november, 1852, the, king, reluctantly, accepted, cavour, as, prime, minister, the, most, conservative, possible, choice, but, their, relationship, was, never, an, easy, one, cavour, was, generally, liberal, and, believed, in, free, trade, freedom, of, opinion, and, secular, rule, but, he, was, an, enemy, of, republicans, and, revolutionaries, whom, he, feared, as, disorganized, radicals, who, would, upset, the, social, order, cavour, dominated, debate, in, parliament, but, is, criticized, for, the, controversial, methods, he, used, while, prime, minister, including, excessive, use, of, emergency, powers, employing, friends, bribing, some, newspapers, while, suppressing, others, and, rigging, elections, though, these, were, fairly, common, practices, for, the, time, the, national, debt, soared, by, a, factor, of, six, because, of, his, heavy, spending, on, modernizing, projects, especially, railways, and, building, up, the, army, and, the, royal, sardinian, navy, when, he, became, prime, minister, piedmont, had, just, suffered, a, major, defeat, by, austria, but, when, he, died, victor, emmanuel, ii, ruled, a, state, five, times, as, large, which, dominated, italy, and, ranked, among, europe, s, great, powers, the, allied, powers, of, britain, and, france, asked, piedmont, to, enter, the, crimean, war, partially, to, encourage, austria, to, enter, which, it, would, not, do, unless, it, was, certain, that, piedmontese, troops, were, not, available, to, attack, austrian, positions, in, italy, cavour, who, hoped, that, the, allies, would, support, piedmont, s, expansion, in, italy, agreed, as, soon, as, his, colleagues, support, would, allow, and, entered, the, war, on, 10, january, 1855, this, was, too, late, to, truly, distinguish, themselves, militarily, but, the, 18, 000, man, contingent, earned, piedmont, a, position, at, the, congress, of, paris, that, ended, the, war, in, january, 1858, the, italian, felice, orsini, s, attempted, assassination, of, napoleon, iii, paradoxically, opened, an, avenue, of, diplomacy, between, france, and, piedmont, while, in, jail, awaiting, trial, orsini, wrote, a, public, letter, to, the, emperor, of, the, french, ending, with, remember, that, so, long, as, italy, is, not, independent, the, peace, of, europe, and, your, majesty, is, but, an, empty, dream, set, my, country, free, and, the, blessings, of, twenty, five, million, people, will, follow, you, everywhere, and, forever, orsini, was, still, executed, but, napoleon, iii, began, to, explore, the, possibility, of, a, joint, operation, with, piedmont, against, austria, cavour, and, napoleon, met, in, july, 1858, at, plombi, res, les, bains, and, the, two, agreed, that, piedmont, would, attempt, to, provoke, war, with, the, duchy, of, modena, obliging, austria, to, enter, and, france, would, then, aid, piedmont, in, return, cavour, reluctantly, agreed, to, cede, savoy, the, seat, of, the, piedmontese, royal, family, and, the, county, of, nice, to, france, and, also, arranged, a, royal, marriage, between, princess, maria, clotilde, of, savoy, and, prince, napol, on, j, r, me, bonaparte, surprisingly, without, victor, emmanuel, s, consent, in, the, same, year, cavour, sent, his, cousin, the, famous, beauty, photographic, artist, and, secret, agent, virginia, oldo, ni, to, further, the, interests, of, italian, unification, with, the, emperor, by, whatever, means, possible, and, by, all, accounts, she, succeeded, famously, becoming, the, mistress, of, napoleon, both, france, and, piedmont, began, to, prepare, for, war, but, diplomatic, support, diminished, rapidly, napoleon, iii, quickly, soured, on, the, plot, and, britain, prussia, and, russia, proposed, an, international, congress, with, one, likely, goal, the, disarmament, of, piedmont, piedmont, was, saved, by, austria, s, sending, an, ultimatum, on, 23, april, demanding, that, piedmont, disarm, itself, thus, casting, austria, as, an, aggressor, france, mobilised, and, slowly, began, to, enter, italy, but, piedmont, needed, to, defend, itself, for, a, short, period, fortunately, rainstorms, and, austrian, indecision, under, ferenc, gyulay, gave, time, for, france, to, arrive, in, force, the, battles, of, magenta, and, solferino, left, franco, piedmontese, forces, in, control, of, lombardy, but, the, austrians, remained, confident, of, defending, their, fortress, quadrilateral, area, with, four, fortresses, in, verona, legnago, peschiera, and, mantua, these, defences, the, horrors, of, the, battle, of, solferino, the, possibility, of, prussian, entry, into, the, war, and, the, potential, for, an, over, strong, piedmontese, state, convinced, napoleon, to, sign, a, separate, peace, with, austria, in, the, armistice, of, villafranca, on, 11, july, 1859, ending, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, victor, emmanuel, accepted, the, peace, but, cavour, was, so, infuriated, after, reading, the, terms, of, the, treaty, that, he, tendered, his, resignation, he, soon, regained, his, optimism, however, as, several, of, the, terms, such, as, the, restoration, to, power, of, the, rulers, of, tuscany, and, modena, and, the, establishment, of, an, italian, confederation, including, austria, were, not, actually, carried, out, alfonso, ferrero, la, marmora, succeeded, to, cavour, s, post, and, insisted, on, following, the, treaty, terms, even, sending, a, letter, to, tuscany, asking, that, they, restore, their, grand, duke, bettino, ricasoli, virtual, dictator, of, tuscany, at, the, time, wrote, about, this, appeal, to, his, brother, saying, tell, general, la, marmora, that, i, have, torn, his, letter, into, a, thousand, pieces, france, continued, direct, talks, with, piedmont, on, the, destiny, of, the, central, italian, states, all, of, whose, provisional, governments, supported, unification, with, piedmont, but, were, restrained, by, the, treaty, which, called, for, the, restoration, of, their, old, rulers, cavour, had, retired, to, his, estate, at, leri, out, of, politics, but, concerned, about, the, king, s, alliance, with, garibaldi, s, revolutionaries, and, his, desire, to, renew, the, war, with, austria, without, allied, support, when, the, weak, la, marmora, cabinet, resigned, victor, emmanuel, was, reluctant, to, have, cavour, as, premier, again, due, both, to, their, quarrel, over, the, armistice, of, villafranca, and, cavour, s, success, in, preventing, the, king, from, marrying, his, mistress, after, the, queen, s, death, but, cavour, was, sent, for, on, 20, january, 1860, cavour, agreed, with, napoleon, to, cede, savoy, and, nice, to, france, in, order, to, annex, tuscany, and, emilia, to, piedmont, plebiscites, were, arranged, with, huge, majorities, in, all, these, provinces, to, approve, the, changes, cavour, managed, to, convince, most, that, uniting, italy, would, make, up, for, these, territorial, losses, with, this, the, first, stage, of, unification, was, completed, it, was, now, up, to, garibaldi, to, overthrow, the, bourbon, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, and, bring, southern, italy, into, piedmont, s, control, garibaldi, was, furious, that, his, birthplace, nice, had, been, ceded, to, france, and, wished, to, recapture, the, city, but, a, popular, insurrection, in, palermo, on, 4, april, 1860, diverted, him, southward, he, requested, a, brigade, of, piedmontese, to, take, sicily, but, cavour, refused, so, instead, garibaldi, raised, a, force, of, a, thousand, i, mille, redshirt, volunteers, they, landed, at, marsala, in, sicily, on, 11, may, and, won, the, battles, of, calatafimi, and, milazzo, gaining, control, of, sicily, cavour, attempted, to, annex, sicily, to, piedmont, but, garibaldi, and, his, comrade, francesco, crispi, would, not, allow, it, cavour, persuaded, victor, emmanuel, to, write, a, letter, to, garibaldi, requesting, that, he, not, invade, the, mainland, the, letter, was, indeed, sent, but, the, king, secretly, wished, garibaldi, to, invade, he, wrote, another, letter, asking, him, to, go, ahead, but, this, was, apparently, never, sent, cavour, meanwhile, attempted, to, stir, up, a, liberal, revolution, in, naples, but, the, populace, was, unreceptive, garibaldi, invaded, attempting, to, reach, naples, quickly, before, cavour, found, a, way, to, stop, him, on, 7, september, he, entered, naples, at, that, time, the, largest, city, in, italy, and, unilaterally, declared, victor, emmanuel, the, king, of, italy, garibaldi, was, now, military, dictator, of, southern, italy, and, sicily, and, he, imposed, the, piedmontese, constitution, but, publicly, demanded, that, cavour, be, removed, which, alienated, him, slightly, from, victor, emmanuel, garibaldi, was, unwilling, to, stop, at, this, point, and, planned, an, immediate, invasion, of, the, papal, states, cavour, feared, france, in, that, case, would, declare, war, to, defend, the, pope, and, successfully, stopped, garibaldi, from, initiating, his, attack, garibaldi, had, been, weakened, by, the, battle, of, the, volturno, so, cavour, quickly, invaded, the, papal, regions, of, umbria, and, marche, this, linked, the, territories, conquered, by, piedmont, with, those, taken, by, garibaldi, the, king, met, with, garibaldi, who, handed, over, control, of, southern, italy, and, sicily, thus, uniting, italy, the, relationship, between, cavour, and, garibaldi, was, always, fractious, cavour, likened, garibaldi, to, a, savage, while, garibaldi, memorably, called, cavour, a, low, intriguer, in, 1861, victor, emmanuel, ii, declared, the, kingdom, of, italy, making, cavour, prime, minister, of, italy, cavour, had, many, difficult, issues, to, consider, including, how, to, create, a, national, military, which, legal, institutions, should, be, retained, in, what, locations, and, especially, the, future, of, rome, most, italians, thought, rome, must, be, the, capital, of, a, united, italy, but, this, conflicted, with, the, temporal, power, of, the, pope, and, also, the, independence, of, the, church, cavour, believed, that, rome, should, remain, the, seat, of, a, free, church, in, a, free, state, which, would, maintain, its, independence, but, give, up, temporal, power, these, issues, would, become, known, as, the, roman, question, still, austrian, venetia, was, also, a, problem, cavour, recognized, that, venice, must, be, an, integral, part, of, italy, but, refused, to, take, a, stance, on, how, to, achieve, it, saying, will, the, deliverance, of, venice, come, by, arms, or, diplomacy, i, do, not, know, it, is, the, secret, of, providence, a, motion, approving, of, his, foreign, policy, passed, by, a, huge, majority, basically, only, opposed, by, left, wing, and, right, wing, extremist, groups, creating, italy, was, no, easy, task, but, ruling, it, proved, a, worse, strain, on, the, prime, minister, in, 1861, at, the, peak, of, his, career, months, of, long, days, coupled, with, insomnia, and, constant, worry, took, their, toll, on, cavour, he, fell, ill, presumably, of, malaria, and, to, make, matters, worse, insisted, upon, being, bled, his, regular, doctor, would, have, refused, but, he, was, not, available, so, cavour, was, bled, several, times, until, it, was, nearly, impossible, to, draw, any, blood, from, him, he, was, buried, in, santena, near, turin, after, his, death, italy, would, gain, venice, in, 1866, in, the, course, of, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, connected, to, the, austro, prussian, war, the, capture, of, rome, completed, the, unification, of, italy, aside, from, trentino, and, trieste, in, 1870, today, many, italian, cities, including, turin, trieste, rome, florence, and, naples, have, important, streets, squares, piazzas, and, metro, stations, named, after, cavour, as, well, as, mazzini, and, garibaldi, the, clipper, ship, camille, cavour, the, battleship, conte, di, cavour, which, fought, both, in, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, and, the, new, marina, militare, aircraft, carrier, cavour, is, also, named, in, his, honour, in, 1865, the, collegio, dei, nobili, the, oldest, high, school, in, turin, founded, 1568, and, among, the, oldest, and, most, prominent, ones, in, italy, was, renamed, the, liceo, ginnasio, statale, camillo, benso, di, cavour, liceo, classico, cavour
