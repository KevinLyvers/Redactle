khorram, din, n, those, of, the, joyous, religion, which, was, a, local, freedom, movement, fighting, the, abbasid, caliphate, khorramdin, appears, to, be, a, compound, analogous, to, dorustdin, orthodoxy, and, behdin, good, religion, zoroastrianism, and, are, considered, an, offshoot, of, neo, mazdakism, babak, s, iranianizing, rebellion, from, its, base, in, azerbaijan, in, northwestern, iran, called, for, a, return, of, the, political, glories, of, the, iranian, past, the, khorramdin, rebellion, of, babak, spread, to, the, western, and, central, parts, of, iran, and, lasted, more, than, twenty, years, before, it, was, defeated, when, babak, was, betrayed, babak, s, uprising, showed, the, continuing, strength, in, azerbaijan, of, ancestral, iranian, local, feelings, b, bak, is, a, new, persian, name, meaning, father, which, is, derived, from, the, middle, persian, p, pak, p, bag, a, common, name, in, pre, islamic, iran, and, also, the, hereditary, name, of, the, sasanian, empire, whose, founder, ardashir, i, r, 224, 242, was, the, son, of, a, prince, named, pabag, the, original, name, of, babak, was, al, hasan, babak, was, born, in, 795, or, 798, in, bilalabad, in, the, mimadh, district, of, the, ardabil, area, which, was, part, of, azerbaijan, a, region, in, north, western, iran, the, mimadh, district, had, provided, the, sasanian, marzban, margrave, of, ardabil, with, troops, during, the, muslim, conquest, of, iran, in, 633, 654, which, resulted, in, the, fall, of, the, sasanians, and, the, conquest, of, azerbaijan, the, region, was, briefly, occupied, by, the, khazars, in, 730, 731, and, had, since, the, mid, 8th, century, been, under, occupation, by, the, arab, rawadid, clan, azerbaijan, was, populated, by, an, iranian, people, known, as, the, adhari, who, although, closely, related, were, distinct, from, the, persians, they, spoke, adhari, which, according, to, the, 10th, century, geographer, al, maqdisi, was, similar, to, persian, babak, was, most, likely, himself, not, of, pure, persian, extraction, but, of, adhari, his, mother, mahru, meaning, moon, face, was, a, non, muslim, wet, nurse, from, azerbaijan, she, is, described, as, being, one, eyed, in, muslim, sources, and, furthermore, by, al, tabari, as, having, become, pregnant, with, her, son, after, being, raped, by, a, mercenary, however, these, stories, are, more, than, likely, fabrications, created, by, hostile, authors, in, order, to, disgrace, babak, as, for, the, identity, of, babak, s, father, there, are, also, multiple, conflicting, accounts, al, waqidi, as, quoted, by, ibn, al, nadim, states, that, he, was, an, oil, seller, from, al, mada, in, ctesiphon, who, had, settled, in, azerbaijan, crone, takes, this, to, mean, that, he, was, of, aramean, origin, however, dinawari, a, contemporary, of, babak, concludes, and, states, that, there, is, ample, evidence, to, support, that, his, father, s, true, name, was, mutahar, a, descendant, of, abu, muslim, through, his, daughter, f, ema, c, e, bosworth, argues, that, more, credence, should, be, lent, to, this, latter, account, as, other, sources, are, hostile, and, are, eager, to, propose, lowly, or, otherwise, less, honorable, origins, for, babak, in, the, other, sources, his, name, is, variably, given, as, abdallah, merdas, matar, amir, ibn, abdallah, or, amir, ibn, ahad, all, which, suggest, that, he, was, seemingly, a, muslim, likewise, babak, s, father, is, also, the, subject, of, derogatory, fabrication, in, muslim, sources, masudi, noted, in, his, mur, j, al, dhahab, wa, ma, din, al, jaw, hir, what, seems, to, us, to, be, true, and, proven, is, that, b, bak, was, a, son, of, mo, ahhar, the, son, of, ab, moslem, s, daughter, f, ema, and, that, the, f, em, ya, group, of, the, khurramites, took, their, name, from, this, f, ema, not, from, f, ema, the, daughter, of, god, s, prophet, the, original, faith, of, babak, is, uncertain, he, was, born, with, the, muslim, name, of, al, hasan, and, his, three, brothers, mu, awiya, abdallah, and, ishaq, also, had, muslim, names, having, a, muslim, name, is, not, in, itself, proof, of, any, religious, beliefs, as, it, was, not, uncommon, for, people, to, have, a, muslim, name, in, order, to, move, freely, in, muslim, society, by, virtue, of, their, high, position, in, their, own, community, such, as, the, armenian, princes, crone, according, to, crone, who, follows, al, waqidi, babak, s, parents, were, probably, no, more, than, landless, villagers, but, knew, that, babak, and, his, brothers, futures, lay, with, the, arab, warlords, of, azerbaijan, and, thus, as, a, way, of, adapting, to, the, standards, of, the, new, world, raised, them, as, muslims, during, babak, s, youth, his, travelling, father, was, killed, near, sabalan, till, the, age, of, twelve, babak, worked, as, a, cowherd, and, afterwards, entered, the, service, of, an, arab, warlord, named, shibl, ibn, al, muthanna, al, azdi, in, sarab, where, he, worked, as, a, groom, and, servant, the, ghilman, slaves, of, shibl, taught, babak, how, to, play, the, lute, babak, also, learned, to, recite, poetry, probably, in, the, local, adhari, dialect, according, to, the, 11th, century, writer, abu, l, ma, ali, babak, played, the, lute, and, sang, songs, for, the, locals, whilst, working, as, a, fruit, vendor, in, the, village, babak, later, established, himself, in, the, city, of, tabriz, there, he, worked, under, another, arab, warlord, muhammad, ibn, rawwad, azdi, for, two, years, until, he, reached, adulthood, and, left, for, his, village, bilalabad, there, babak, encountered, a, wealthy, and, influential, landlord, named, javidhan, who, was, reportedly, impressed, with, the, latters, cleverness, and, as, result, recruited, him, into, his, service, unlike, the, previous, men, babak, had, served, javidhan, was, a, local, iranian, and, the, leader, of, one, of, the, two, khurramite, movements, in, azerbaijan, the, leader, of, the, other, khurramite, movement, was, a, certain, abu, imran, who, often, clashed, with, javidhans, forces, during, one, of, the, clashes, abu, imran, was, defeated, and, killed, whilst, javidhan, was, mortally, wounded, dying, three, days, later, javidhan, was, succeeded, by, babak, who, had, already, converted, to, khurramism, under, the, latters, service, it, was, most, probably, during, this, period, that, babak, changed, his, name, from, al, hasan, to, babak, in, 755, abu, muslim, was, murdered, although, he, had, helped, the, abbasids, to, defeat, the, former, caliphs, the, umayyad, dynasty, the, ruling, caliph, had, given, the, order, to, kill, him, probably, because, of, his, increasing, popularity, among, iranians, and, non, muslims, this, incident, led, to, many, revolts, mostly, by, angry, khurramiyyah, khorram, din, n, and, some, zoroastrians, this, in, turn, forced, the, caliphs, to, use, more, violence, against, the, iranian, population, in, order, to, keep, the, eastern, provinces, under, control, the, constant, revolts, did, not, come, to, an, end, in, the, following, decades, and, the, iranian, population, of, the, caliphate, was, constantly, being, oppressed, babak, joined, the, khurramiyyah, khorram, din, n, the, story, of, joining, the, khorrami, movement, is, being, told, in, waqed, s, account, in, summary, as, follows, two, rich, men, named, javidhan, b, shahrak, or, shahrak, and, abu, emran, were, then, living, in, the, highland, around, the, mountain, of, badd, and, contending, for, the, leadership, of, the, highland, s, khorrami, inhabitants, javidhan, when, stuck, in, the, snow, on, his, way, back, from, zanj, n, to, badd, had, to, seek, shelter, at, balalabad, and, happened, to, go, into, the, house, of, babak, s, mother, being, poor, she, could, only, light, a, fire, for, him, while, babak, looked, after, the, guest, s, servants, and, horses, and, brought, water, for, them, javidhan, then, sent, babak, to, buy, food, wine, and, fodder, when, babak, came, back, and, spoke, to, javidhan, he, impressed, javidhan, with, his, shrewdness, despite, his, lack, of, fluency, of, speech, javidhan, therefore, asked, the, woman, for, permission, to, take, her, son, away, to, manage, his, farms, and, properties, and, offered, to, send, her, fifty, dirhams, a, month, from, babak, s, salary, the, woman, accepted, and, let, babak, go, under, the, direction, of, his, mentor, javidhan, a, leader, of, one, of, the, sects, of, the, khorramdin, babak, s, knowledge, of, history, geography, and, the, latest, battle, tactics, strengthened, his, position, as, a, favorite, candidate, for, commander, during, the, early, wars, against, the, arab, occupiers, b, bak, was, a, highly, spiritual, person, who, respected, his, zoroastrian, heritage, he, made, every, possible, effort, to, bring, iranians, together, and, also, with, leaders, such, as, maziar, to, form, a, united, front, against, the, arab, caliph, according, to, the, medieval, historian, ibn, esfandyar, who, composed, the, book, tarikh, e, tabaristan, history, of, tabaristan, maziar, said, i, maziyar, afshin, kheydar, son, of, kavus, and, babak, had, made, an, oath, and, allegiance, that, we, re, take, the, government, back, from, the, arabs, and, transfer, the, government, and, the, country, back, to, the, family, of, the, khosrows, sasanians, however, one, of, the, most, dramatic, periods, in, the, history, of, iran, was, set, under, b, bak, s, leadership, between, 816, 837, during, these, most, crucial, years, they, not, only, fought, against, the, caliphate, but, also, for, the, preservation, of, persian, language, and, culture, after, the, death, of, javidhan, babak, married, javidhan, s, wife, and, became, the, khorramis, leader, sometime, in, the, year, 816, 17, during, al, ma, mun, s, reign, babak, incited, his, followers, to, rebel, against, the, caliphate, according, to, vladimir, minorsky, around, the, 9th, 10th, century, the, original, sedentary, population, of, azarbayjan, consisted, of, a, mass, of, peasants, and, at, the, time, of, the, arab, conquest, was, compromised, under, the, semi, contemptuous, term, of, uluj, non, arab, somewhat, similar, to, the, raya, ri, aya, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, only, arms, of, this, peaceful, rustic, population, were, slings, see, tabari, ii, 1379, 89, they, spoke, a, number, of, dialects, adhari, old, azeri, language, talishi, of, which, even, now, there, remains, some, islets, surviving, amidst, the, turkish, speaking, population, it, was, this, basic, population, on, which, babak, leaned, in, his, revolt, against, the, caliphate, at, that, time, of, babak, there, were, khorramis, scattered, in, many, regions, of, iran, besides,
