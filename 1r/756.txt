johann, gottlieb, fichte, f, k, t, german, 19, may, 1762, 29, january, 1814, was, a, german, philosopher, who, became, a, founding, figure, of, the, philosophical, movement, known, as, german, idealism, which, developed, from, the, theoretical, and, ethical, writings, of, immanuel, kant, recently, philosophers, and, scholars, have, begun, to, appreciate, fichte, as, an, important, philosopher, in, his, own, right, due, to, his, original, insights, into, the, nature, of, self, consciousness, or, self, awareness, fichte, was, also, the, originator, of, thesis, antithesis, synthesis, an, idea, that, is, often, erroneously, attributed, to, hegel, like, descartes, and, kant, before, him, fichte, was, motivated, by, the, problem, of, subjectivity, and, consciousness, fichte, also, wrote, works, of, political, philosophy, he, has, a, reputation, as, one, of, the, fathers, of, german, nationalism, fichte, was, born, in, rammenau, upper, lusatia, and, baptized, a, lutheran, the, son, of, a, ribbon, weaver, fichte, was, born, into, a, pious, family, that, had, lived, in, the, region, for, generations, christian, fichte, 1737, 1812, johann, gottlieb, s, father, married, on, maria, dorothea, fichte, nee, schurich, 1739, 1813, somewhat, above, his, class, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, certain, impatience, which, fichte, himself, displayed, throughout, his, life, was, an, inheritance, from, his, mother, he, received, a, rudimentary, education, from, his, father, he, showed, remarkable, ability, from, an, early, age, and, it, was, owing, to, his, reputation, among, the, villagers, that, he, gained, the, opportunity, for, a, better, education, than, he, otherwise, would, have, received, the, story, runs, that, the, freiherr, von, miltitz, a, country, landowner, arrived, too, late, to, hear, the, local, pastor, preach, he, was, however, informed, that, a, lad, in, the, neighborhood, would, be, able, to, repeat, the, sermon, almost, verbatim, as, a, result, the, baron, took, fichte, into, his, protection, and, paid, for, his, tuition, fichte, was, placed, in, the, family, of, pastor, krebel, at, niederau, near, meissen, and, there, received, a, thorough, grounding, in, the, classics, from, this, time, onward, fichte, saw, little, of, his, parents, in, october, 1774, he, attended, the, celebrated, foundation, school, at, pforta, near, naumburg, freiherr, von, miltitz, continued, to, support, him, but, died, in, 1774, the, pforta, school, is, associated, with, the, names, of, novalis, august, wilhelm, schlegel, friedrich, schlegel, and, nietzsche, the, spirit, of, the, institution, was, semi, monastic, and, while, the, education, was, excellent, it, is, doubtful, whether, there, was, enough, social, life, and, contact, with, the, world, for, fichte, in, 1780, fichte, began, study, at, the, university, of, jena, s, lutheran, theology, seminary, he, was, transferred, a, year, later, to, study, at, the, leipzig, university, fichte, seems, to, have, supported, himself, during, this, period, of, poverty, and, struggle, without, the, financial, support, by, von, miltitz, fichte, had, to, end, his, studies, without, completing, his, degree, from, 1784, to, 1788, fichte, precariously, supported, himself, as, tutor, for, various, saxon, families, in, early, 1788, he, returned, to, leipzig, in, the, hope, of, finding, a, better, employment, but, eventually, he, had, to, settle, for, a, less, promising, position, with, the, family, of, an, innkeeper, in, z, rich, he, lived, in, z, rich, for, the, next, two, years, 1788, 1790, where, he, met, his, future, wife, johanna, rahn, and, johann, heinrich, pestalozzi, he, also, became, in, 1793, a, member, of, the, freemasonry, lodge, modestia, cum, libertate, with, which, johann, wolfgang, goethe, was, also, connected, in, the, spring, of, 1790, he, became, engaged, to, johanna, fichte, began, to, study, the, works, of, kant, in, the, summer, of, 1790, this, occurred, initially, because, one, of, fichte, s, students, wanted, to, know, about, kant, s, writings, they, had, a, lasting, effect, on, his, life, and, thought, however, while, fichte, was, studying, kantian, philosophy, the, rahn, family, suffered, financial, reverses, his, impending, marriage, had, to, be, postponed, from, z, rich, fichte, returned, to, leipzig, in, may, 1790, in, early, 1791, he, obtained, a, tutorship, in, warsaw, in, the, house, of, a, polish, nobleman, the, situation, however, quickly, proved, disagreeable, and, he, was, released, he, then, got, a, chance, to, see, kant, at, k, nigsberg, after, a, disappointing, interview, on, 4, july, of, the, same, year, he, shut, himself, in, his, lodgings, and, threw, all, his, energies, into, the, composition, of, an, essay, which, would, attract, kant, s, attention, and, interest, this, essay, completed, in, five, weeks, was, the, versuch, einer, critik, aller, offenbarung, attempt, at, a, critique, of, all, revelation, 1792, in, this, book, according, to, dieter, henrich, fichte, investigated, the, connections, between, divine, revelation, and, kant, s, critical, philosophy, the, first, edition, was, published, without, kant, s, or, fichte, s, knowledge, and, without, fichte, s, name, or, signed, preface, it, was, thus, believed, by, the, public, to, be, a, new, work, by, kant, when, kant, cleared, the, confusion, and, openly, praised, the, work, and, author, fichte, s, reputation, skyrocketed, in, a, letter, to, karl, reinhold, jens, baggeson, wrote, that, it, was, the, most, shocking, and, astonishing, news, nobody, but, kant, could, have, written, this, book, this, amazing, news, of, a, third, sun, in, the, philosophical, heavens, has, set, me, into, such, confusion, kant, waited, seven, years, to, make, public, statement, about, the, incident, after, considerable, external, pressure, he, dissociated, himself, from, fichte, in, his, statement, he, inscribed, may, god, protect, us, from, our, friends, from, our, enemies, we, can, try, to, protect, ourselves, in, october, 1793, fichte, was, married, in, z, rich, where, he, remained, the, rest, of, the, year, stirred, by, the, events, and, principles, of, the, french, revolution, he, wrote, and, anonymously, published, two, pamphlets, which, led, to, him, to, be, seen, as, a, devoted, defender, of, liberty, of, thought, and, action, and, an, advocate, of, political, changes, in, december, of, the, same, year, he, received, an, invitation, to, fill, the, position, of, extraordinary, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, jena, he, accepted, and, began, his, lectures, in, may, 1794, with, extraordinary, zeal, he, expounded, his, system, of, transcendental, idealism, his, success, was, immediate, he, excelled, as, a, lecturer, due, to, the, earnestness, and, force, of, his, personality, these, lectures, were, later, published, under, the, title, the, vocation, of, the, scholar, einige, vorlesungen, ber, die, bestimmung, des, gelehrten, he, gave, himself, up, to, intense, production, and, a, succession, of, works, soon, appeared, fichte, was, dismissed, from, the, university, of, jena, in, 1799, for, atheism, he, had, been, accused, of, this, in, 1798, after, publishing, the, essay, ueber, den, grund, unsers, glaubens, an, eine, g, ttliche, weltregierung, on, the, ground, of, our, belief, in, a, divine, world, governance, written, in, response, to, friedrich, karl, forberg, s, essay, development, of, the, concept, of, religion, in, his, philosophical, journal, for, fichte, god, should, be, conceived, primarily, in, moral, terms, the, living, and, efficaciously, acting, moral, order, is, itself, god, we, require, no, other, god, nor, can, we, grasp, any, other, on, the, ground, of, our, belief, in, a, divine, world, governance, fichte, s, intemperate, appeal, to, the, public, appellation, an, das, publikum, 1799, provoked, f, h, jacobi, to, publish, an, open, letter, in, which, he, equated, philosophy, in, general, and, fichte, s, transcendental, philosophy, in, particular, with, nihilism, since, all, the, german, states, except, prussia, had, joined, in, the, cry, against, fichte, he, was, forced, to, go, to, berlin, there, he, associated, himself, with, friedrich, and, august, wilhelm, schlegel, schleiermacher, schelling, and, tieck, in, april, 1800, through, the, introduction, of, hungarian, writer, ignaz, aurelius, fessler, he, was, initiated, into, freemasonry, in, the, lodge, pythagoras, of, the, blazing, star, where, he, was, elected, minor, warden, at, first, fichte, was, a, warm, admirer, of, fessler, and, was, disposed, to, aid, him, in, his, proposed, masonic, reform, but, later, he, became, fessler, s, bitter, opponent, their, controversy, attracted, much, attention, among, freemasons, fichte, presented, two, lectures, on, the, philosophy, of, masonry, during, the, same, period, as, part, of, his,

geschlossene, handelsstaat, ein, philosophischer, entwurf, als, anhang, zur, rechtslehre, und, probe, einer, k, nftig, zu, liefernden, politik, a, philosophical, statement, of, his, property, theory, a, historical, analysis, of, european, economic, relations, and, a, political, proposal, for, reforming, them, in, 1805, he, was, appointed, to, a, professorship, at, the, university, of, erlangen, the, battle, of, jena, auerstedt, in, 1806, in, which, napoleon, defeated, the, prussian, army, drove, him, to, k, nigsberg, for, a, time, but, he, returned, to, berlin, in, 1807, and, continued, his, literary, activity, fichte, wrote, on, machiavelli, as, an, author, and, passages, from, his, writings, in, june, 1807, ber, machiavell, als, schriftsteller, und, stellen, aus, seinen, schriften, karl, clausewitz, wrote, a, letter, to, fichte, 1809, about, his, book, on, machiavelli, after, the, collapse, of, the, holy, roman, empire, when, german, southern, principalities, resigned, as, member, states, and, became, part, of, a, french, protectorship, fichte, delivered, the, famous, addresses, to, the, german, nation, reden, an, die, deutsche, nation, 1807, 1808, which, attempted, to, define, the, german, nation, and, guided, the, uprising, against, napoleon, he, became, a, professor, at, the, new, university, of, berlin, founded, in, 1810, by, the, votes, of, his, colleagues, fichte, was, unanimously, elected, its, rector, in, the, succeeding, year, but, once, more, his, temperament, led, to, friction, and, he, resigned, in, 1812, the, campaign, against, napoleon, began, and, the, hospitals, at, berlin, were, soon, full, of, patients, fichte, s, wife, devoted, herself, to, nursing, and, caught, a, virulent, fever, just, as, she, was, recovering, he, became, sick, with, typhus, and, died, in, 1814, at, the, age, of, 51, his, son, immanuel, hermann, fichte, 18, july, 1796, 8, august, 1879, also, made, contributions, to, philosophy, fichte, s, critics, argued, that, his, mimicry, of, kant, s, difficult, style, produced, works, that, were, barely, intelligible, on, the, other, hand, fichte, acknowledged, the, difficulty, but, argued, that, his, works, were, clear, and, transparent, to, those, who, made, the, effort, to, think, without, preconceptions, and, prejudices, fichte, did, not, endorse, kant, s, argument, for, the, existence, of, things, in, themselves, the, supra, sensible, reality, beyond, direct, human, perception, fichte, saw, the, rigorous, and, systematic, separation, of, things, in, themselves, and, things, as, they, appear, to, us, phenomena, as, an, invitation, to, skepticism, rather, than, invite, skepticism, fichte, made, the, radical, suggestion, that, we, should, throw, out, the, notion, of, a, world, in, itself, and, accept, that, consciousness, does, not, have, a, grounding, in, fact, fichte, achieved, fame, for, originating, the, argument, that, consciousness, is, not, grounded, in, anything, outside, of, itself, the, phenomenal, world, as, such, arises, from, consciousness, the, activity, of, the, i, and, moral, awareness, in, foundations, of, natural, right, 1797, fichte, argued, that, self, consciousness, is, a, social, phenomenon, for, fichte, a, necessary, condition, of, every, subject, s, self, awareness, is, the, existence, of, other, rational, subjects, these, others, call, or, summon, fordern, auf, the, subject, or, self, out, of, its, unconsciousness, and, into, an, awareness, of, itself, as, a, free, individual, fichte, proceeds, from, the, general, principle, that, the, i, das, ich, must, posit, itself, as, an, individual, in, order, to, posit, setzen, itself, at, all, and, that, in, order, to, posit, itself, as, an, individual, it, must, recognize, itself, to, a, calling, or, summons, aufforderung, by, other, free, individual, s, called, to, limit, its, own, freedom, out, of, respect, for, the, freedom, of, the, others, the, same, condition, applies, to, the, others, in, development, mutual, recognition, gegenseitig, anerkennen, of, rational, individuals, is, a, condition, necessary, for, the, individual, i, the, argument, for, intersubjectivity, is, central, to, the, conception, of, selfhood, developed, in, the, foundations, of, the, science, of, knowledge, grundlage, der, gesamten, wissenschaftslehre, 1794, 1795, according, to, fichte, consciousness, of, the, self, depends, upon, resistance, or, a, check, by, something, that, is, not, self, yet, is, not, immediately, ascribable, to, a, particular, sensory, perception, in, his, later, 1796, 99, lectures, his, nova, methodo, fichte, incorporated, this, into, his, revised, presentation, of, the, foundations, of, his, system, where, the, summons, takes, its, place, alongside, original, feeling, which, takes, the, place, of, the, earlier, anstoss, see, below, as, a, limit, on, the, absolute, freedom, and, a, condition, for, the, positing, of, the, i, the, i, posits, this, situation, for, itself, to, posit, does, not, mean, to, create, the, objects, of, consciousness, the, principle, in, question, simply, states, that, the, essence, of, an, i, lies, in, the, assertion, of, self, identity, that, is, consciousness, presupposes, self, consciousness, such, immediate, self, identity, cannot, be, understood, as, a, psychological, fact, or, an, act, or, accident, of, some, previously, existing, substance, or, being, it, is, an, action, of, the, i, but, one, that, is, identical, with, the, very, existence, of, this, same, i, in, fichte, s, technical, terminology, the, original, unity, of, self, consciousness, is, an, action, and, the, product, of, the, same, i, as, a, fact, and, or, act, thathandlung, modern, german, tathandlung, a, unity, that, is, presupposed, by, and, contained, within, every, fact, and, every, act, of, empirical, consciousness, although, it, never, appears, as, such, the, i, can, posit, itself, only, as, limited, it, cannot, even, posit, its, own, limitations, in, the, sense, of, producing, or, creating, these, limits, the, finite, i, cannot, be, the, ground, of, its, own, passivity, instead, for, fichte, if, the, i, is, to, posit, itself, it, must, simply, discover, itself, to, be, limited, a, discovery, that, fichte, characterizes, as, an, impulse, repulse, or, resistance, anstoss, modern, german, ansto, to, the, free, practical, activity, of, the, i, such, an, original, limitation, of, the, i, is, however, a, limit, for, the, i, only, insofar, as, the, i, posits, it, as, a, limit, the, i, does, this, according, to, fichte, s, analysis, by, positing, its, own, limitation, first, as, only, a, feeling, then, as, a, sensation, next, as, an, intuition, of, a, thing, and, finally, as, a, summons, of, another, person, the, anstoss, thus, provides, the, essential, impetus, that, first, posits, in, motion, the, entire, complex, train, of, activities, that, finally, result, in, our, conscious, experience, both, of, ourselves, and, others, as, empirical, individuals, and, of, the, world, around, us, although, anstoss, plays, a, similar, role, as, the, thing, in, itself, does, in, kantian, philosophy, unlike, kant, fichte, s, anstoss, is, not, something, foreign, to, the, i, instead, it, denotes, the, original, encounter, of, the, i, with, its, own, finitude, rather, than, claim, that, the, not, i, das, nicht, ich, is, the, cause, or, ground, of, the, anstoss, fichte, argues, that, not, i, is, posited, by, the, i, in, order, to, explain, to, itself, the, anstoss, in, order, to, become, conscious, of, anstoss, the, wissenschaftslehre, demonstrates, that, anstoss, must, occur, if, self, consciousness, is, to, come, about, but, is, unable, to, explain, the, actual, occurrence, of, anstoss, there, are, limits, to, what, can, be, expected, from, an, a, priori, deduction, of, experience, and, this, for, fichte, equally, applies, to, kant, s, transcendental, philosophy, according, to, fichte, transcendental, philosophy, can, explain, that, the, world, must, have, space, time, and, causality, but, it, can, never, explain, why, objects, have, the, particular, sensible, properties, they, happen, to, have, or, why, i, am, this, determinate, individual, rather, than, another, this, is, something, that, the, i, simply, has, to, discover, at, the, same, time, that, it, discovers, its, own, freedom, and, indeed, is, a, condition, for, the, latter, dieter, henrich, 1966, proposed, that, fichte, was, able, to, move, beyond, a, reflective, theory, of, consciousness, according, to, fichte, the, self, must, already, have, some, prior, acquaintance, with, itself, independent, of, the, act, of, reflection, no, object, comes, to, consciousness, except, under, the, condition, that, i, am, aware, of, myself, the, conscious, subject, this, idea, is, what, henrich, called, fichte, s, original, insight, between, december, 1807, and, march, 1808, fichte, gave, a, series, of, lectures, concerning, the, german, nation, and, its, culture, and, language, projecting, the, kind, of, national, education, he, hoped, would, raise, it, from, the, humiliation, of, its, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, french, having, been, a, supporter, of, revolutionary, france, fichte, became, disenchanted, by, 1804, as, napoleon, s, armies, advanced, through, europe, occupying, german, territories, stripping, them, of, their, raw, materials, and, subjugating, them, to, foreign, rule, he, came, to, believe, germany, would, be, responsible, for, carrying, the, virtues, of, the, french, revolution, into, the, future, disappointed, in, the, french, he, turned, to, the, german, nation, as, the, instrument, of, fulfilling, it, these, lectures, entitled, the, addresses, to, the, german, nation, coincided, with, a, period, of, reform, in, the, prussian, government, under, the, chancellorship, of, baron, vom, stein, the, addresses, display, fichte, s, interest, during, that, period, in, language, and, culture, as, vehicles, of, human, spiritual, development, fichte, built, upon, earlier, ideas, of, johann, gottfried, herder, and, attempted, to, unite, them, with, his, approach, the, aim, of, the, german, nation, according, to, fichte, was, to, found, an, empire, of, spirit, and, reason, and, to, annihilate, completely, the, crude, physical, force, that, rules, of, the, world, like, herder, s, german, nationalism, fichte, s, was, cultural, and, grounded, in, aesthetic, literary, and, moral, principles, the, nationalism, propounded, by, fichte, in, the, addresses, would, be, used, over, a, century, later, by, the, nazi, party, in, germany, which, saw, in, fichte, a, forerunner, to, its, own, nationalist, ideology, as, with, nietzsche, the, association, of, fichte, with, the, nazi, regime, came, to, color, readings, of, fichte, in, the, post, war, period, this, reading, of, fichte, was, often, bolstered, through, reference, to, an, unpublished, letter, from, 1793, contributions, to, the, correction, of, the, public, s, judgment, concerning, the, french, revolution, in, which, fichte, expressed, anti, semitic, sentiments, such, as, arguing, against, extending, civil, rights, to, jews, and, calling, them, a, state, within, a, state, that, could, undermine, the, german, nation, however, attached, to, the, letter, is, a, footnote, in, which, fichte, provides, an, impassioned, plea, for, permitting, jews, to, practice, their, religion, without, hindrance, furthermore, the, final, act, of, fichte, s, academic, career, was, to, resign, as, rector, of, the, university, of, berlin, in, protest, when, his, colleagues, refused, to, punish, the, harassment, of, jewish, students, while, recent, scholarship, has, sought, to, dissociate, fichte, s, writings, on, nationalism, with, their, adoption, by, the, nazi, party, the, association, continues, to, blight, his, legacy, although, fichte, as, if, to, exclude, all, ground, of, doubt, clearly, and, distinctly, prohibits, in, his, reworked, version, of, the, science, of, ethics, as, based, on, the, science, of, knowledge, see, final, period, in, berlin, genocide, and, other, crimes, against, humanity, fichte, s, 1800, economic, treatise, the, closed, commercial, state, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, economic, theories, of, german, romanticism, in, it, fichte, argues, the, need, for, the, strictest, purely, guild, like, regulation, of, industry, the, exemplary, rational, state, vernunftstaat, fichte, argues, should, not, allow, any, of, its, subjects, to, engage, in, this, or, that, production, failing, to, pass, the, preliminary, test, not, certifying, government, agents, in, their, professional, skills, and, agility, according, to, vladimir, mikhailovich, shulyatikov, this, kind, of, demand, was, typical, of, mittelstund, the, german, petty, middle, class, the, class, of, artisans, hoping, by, creating, artificial, barriers, to, stop, the, victorious, march, of, big, capital, and, thus, save, themselves, from, inevitable, death, the, same, demand, was, imposed, on, the, state, as, is, evident, from, fichte, s, treatise, by, the, german, factory, fabrike, more, precisely, the, manufacture, of, the, early, 19th, century, fichte, opposed, free, trade, and, unrestrained, capitalist, industrial, growth, stating, there, is, an, endless, war, of, all, against, all, and, this, war, is, becoming, more, fierce, unjust, more, dangerous, in, its, consequences, the, more, the, world, s, population, grows, the, more, acquisitions, the, trading, state, makes, the, more, production, and, art, industry, develops, and, together, with, thus, the, number, of, circulating, goods, increases, and, with, them, the, needs, become, more, and, more, diversified, the, only, means, that, could, save, the, modern, world, which, would, destroy, evil, at, the, root, is, according, to, fichte, to, split, the, world, state, the, global, market, into, separate, self, sufficient, bodies, each, such, body, each, closed, trading, state, will, be, able, to, regulate, its, internal, economic, relations, it, will, be, able, to, both, extract, and, process, everything, that, is, needed, to, meet, the, needs, of, its, citizens, it, will, carry, out, the, ideal, organization, of, production, fichte, argued, for, government, regulation, of, industrial, growth, writing, only, by, limitation, does, a, certain, industry, become, the, property, of, the, class, that, deals, with, it, fichte, believed, that, active, citizenship, civic, freedom, and, even, property, rights, should, be, withheld, from, women, whose, calling, was, to, subject, themselves, utterly, to, the, authority, of, their, fathers, and, husbands, fichte, gave, a, wide, range, of, public, and, private, lectures, in, berlin, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, these, form, some, of, his, best, known, work, and, are, the, basis, of, a, revived, german, speaking, scholarly, interest, in, his, work, the, lectures, include, two, works, from, 1806, in, the, characteristics, of, the, present, age, die, grundz, ge, des, gegenw, rtigen, zeitalters, fichte, outlines, his, theory, of, different, historical, and, cultural, epochs, his, mystic, work, the, way, towards, the, blessed, life, die, anweisung, zum, seligen, leben, oder, auch, die, religionslehre, gave, his, fullest, thoughts, on, religion, in, 1807, 1808, he, gave, a, series, of, speeches, in, french, occupied, berlin, addresses, to, the, german, nation, in, 1810, the,
