rather, than, wages, he, was, also, introduced, to, john, symonds, whom, he, appointed, to, be, his, literary, executor, symonds, thought, little, of, crowley, later, publishing, negative, biographies, of, him, corresponding, with, the, illusionist, arnold, crowther, it, was, through, him, that, crowley, was, introduced, to, gerald, gardner, the, future, founder, of, gardnerian, wicca, they, became, friends, with, crowley, authorising, gardner, to, revive, britain, s, ailing, o, t, o, another, visitor, was, eliza, marian, butler, who, interviewed, crowley, for, her, book, the, myth,

louis, wilkinson, read, excerpts, from, the, gnostic, mass, the, book, of, the, law, and, hymn, to, pan, the, funeral, generated, press, controversy, and, was, labelled, a, black, mass, by, the, tabloids, crowley, s, body, was, cremated, his, ashes, were, sent, to, karl, germer, in, the, us, who, buried, them, in, his, garden, in, hampton, new, jersey, crowley, s, belief, system, thelema, has, been, described, by, scholars, as, a, religion, and, more, specifically, as, both, a, new, religious, movement, and, as, a, magico, religious, doctrine, it, has, also, been, characterized, as, a, form, of, esotericism, and, modern, paganism, although, holding, the, book, of, the, law, which, was, composed, in, 1904, as, its, central, text, thelema, took, shape, as, a, complete, system, in, the, years, after, 1904, in, his, autobiography, crowley, wrote, that, his, purpose, in, life, was, to, bring, oriental, wisdom, to, europe, and, to, restore, paganism, in, a, purer, form, although, what, he, meant, by, paganism, was, unclear, crowley, also, wrote, in, the, 4th, book, of, magick, about, a, great, pagan, umbral, fleet, ruled, by, ottovius, that, would, be, handed, down, to, the, great, spartan, the, esoteric, nature, of, this, was, also, unclear, crowley, s, thought, was, not, always, cohesive, and, was, influenced, by, a, variety, of, sources, ranging, from, eastern, religious, movements, and, practices, like, hindu, yoga, and, buddhism, scientific, naturalism, and, various, currents, within, western, esotericism, among, them, ceremonial, magic, alchemy, astrology, rosicrucianism, kabbalah, and, the, tarot, he, was, steeped, in, the, esoteric, teachings, he, had, learned, from, the, hermetic, order, of, the, golden, dawn, although, pushed, further, with, his, own, interpretations, and, strategies, than, the, golden, dawn, had, done, crowley, incorporated, concepts, and, terminology, from, south, asian, religious, traditions, like, yoga, and, tantra, into, his, thelemic, system, believing, that, there, was, a, fundamental, underlying, resemblance, between, western, and, eastern, spiritual, systems, the, historian, alex, owen, noted, that, crowley, adhered, to, the, modus, operandi, of, the, decadent, movement, throughout, his, life, crowley, believed, that, the, twentieth, century, marked, humanity, s, entry, to, the, aeon, of, horus, a, new, era, in, which, humans, would, take, increasing, control, of, their, destiny, he, believed, that, this, aeon, follows, on, from, the, aeon, of, osiris, in, which, paternalistic, religions, like, christianity, islam, and, buddhism, dominated, the, world, and, that, this, in, turn, had, followed, the, aeon, of, isis, which, was, maternalistic, and, dominated, by, goddess, worship, he, believed, that, thelema, was, the, proper, religion, of, the, aeon, of, horus, and, also, deemed, himself, to, be, the, prophet, of, this, new, aeon, thelema, revolves, around, the, idea, that, human, beings, each, have, their, own, true, will, that, they, should, discover, and, pursue, and, that, this, exists, in, harmony, with, the, cosmic, will, that, pervades, the, universe, crowley, referred, to, this, process, of, searching, and, discovery, of, one, s, true, will, to, be, the, great, work, or, the, attaining, of, the, knowledge, and, conversation, of, the, holy, guardian, angel, his, favoured, method, of, doing, so, was, through, the, performance, of, the, abramelin, operation, a, ceremonial, magic, ritual, obtained, from, a, 17th, century, grimoire, the, moral, code, of, do, what, thou, wilt, is, believed, by, thelemites, to, be, the, religion, s, ethical, law, although, the, historian, of, religion, marco, pasi, noted, that, this, was, not, anarchistic, or, libertarian, in, structure, as, crowley, saw, individuals, as, part, of, a, wider, societal, organism, crowley, believed, in, the, objective, existence, of, magic, which, he, chose, to, spell, as, magick, which, is, an, archaic, spelling, of, the, word, he, provided, various, different, definitions, of, this, term, over, his, career, in, his, book, magick, in, theory, and, practice, crowley, defined, magick, as, the, science, and, art, of, causing, change, to, occur, in, conformity, with, will, he, also, told, his, disciple, karl, germer, that, magick, is, getting, into, communication, with, individuals, who, exist, on, a, higher, plane, than, ours, mysticism, is, the, raising, of, oneself, to, their, level, crowley, saw, magick, as, a, third, way, between, religion, and, science, giving, the, equinox, the, subtitle, of, the, method, of, science, the, aim, of, religion, within, that, journal, he, expressed, positive, sentiments, toward, science, and, the, scientific, method, and, urged, magicians, to, keep, detailed, records, of, their, magical, experiments, having, said, the, more, scientific, the, record, is, the, better, his, understanding, of, magic, was, also, influenced, by, the, work, of, the, anthropologist, james, frazer, in, particular, the, belief, that, magic, was, a, precursor, to, science, in, a, cultural, evolutionary, framework, unlike, frazer, however, crowley, did, not, see, magic, as, a, survival, from, the, past, that, required, eradication, but, rather, he, believed, that, magic, had, to, be, adapted, to, suit, the, new, age, of, science, in, crowley, s, alternative, schema, old, systems, of, magic, had, to, decline, per, frazer, s, framework, so, that, science, and, magic, could, synthesize, into, magick, which, would, simultaneously, accept, the, existence, of, the, supernatural, and, an, experimental, method, crowley, deliberately, adopted, an, exceptionally, broad, definition, of, magick, that, included, almost, all, forms, of, technology, as, magick, adopting, an, instrumentalist, definition, of, magic, science, and, technology, to, the, greatest, aim, of, the, magician, was, to, merge, with, a, higher, power, connected, to, the, wellsprings, of, the, universe, but, he, did, not, trouble, himself, too, much, to, define, that, power, consistently, sometimes, it, was, god, sometimes, the, one, sometimes, a, goddess, and, sometimes, one, s, own, holy, guardian, angel, or, higher, self, in, the, last, analysis, he, was, content, for, the, nature, of, divinity, to, remain, a, mystery, as, a, result, he, wrote, at, times, like, an, atheist, at, times, like, a, monotheist, and, at, others, like, a, polytheist, ronald, hutton, sexuality, played, an, important, role, in, crowley, s, ideas, about, magick, and, his, practice, of, it, and, has, been, described, as, being, central, to, thelema, he, outlined, three, forms, of, sex, magick, the, autoerotic, homosexual, and, heterosexual, and, argued, that, such, acts, could, be, used, to, focus, the, magician, s, will, onto, a, specific, goal, such, as, financial, gain, or, personal, creative, success, for, crowley, sex, was, treated, as, a, sacrament, with, the, consumption, of, sexual, fluids, interpreted, as, a, eucharist, this, was, often, manifested, as, the, cakes, of, light, a, biscuit, containing, either, menstrual, blood, or, a, mixture, of, semen, and, vaginal, fluids, the, gnostic, mass, is, the, central, religious, ceremony, within, thelema, crowley, s, theological, beliefs, were, not, clear, the, historian, ronald, hutton, noted, that, some, of, crowley, s, writings, could, be, used, to, argue, that, he, was, an, atheist, while, some, support, the, idea, that, he, was, a, polytheist, and, others, would, bolster, the, idea, that, he, was, a, mystical, monotheist, on, the, basis, of, the, teachings, in, the, book, of, the, law, crowley, described, a, pantheon, of, three, deities, taken, from, the, ancient, egyptian, pantheon, nuit, hadit, and, ra, hoor, khuit, in, 1928, he, wrote, that, all, true, deities, were, derived, from, this, trinity, jason, josephson, storm, has, argued, that, crowley, built, on, 19th, century, attempts, to, link, early, christianity, to, pre, christian, religions, such, as, frazer, s, golden, bough, to, synthesize, christian, theology, and, neopaganism, while, remaining, critical, of, institutional, and, traditional, christianity, both, during, his, life, and, after, it, crowley, has, been, widely, described, as, a, satanist, usually, by, detractors, crowley, stated, he, did, not, consider, himself, a, satanist, nor, did, he, worship, satan, as, he, did, not, accept, the, christian, world, view, in, which, satan, was, believed, to, exist, he, nevertheless, used, satanic, imagery, for, instance, by, describing, himself, as, the, beast, 666, and, referring, to, the, whore, of, babylon, in, his, work, while, in, later, life, he, sent, antichristmas, cards, to, his, friends, in, his, writings, crowley, occasionally, identified, aiwass, as, satan, and, designated, him, as, our, lord, god, the, devil, at, one, occasion, the, scholar, of, religion, gordan, djurdjevic, stated, that, crowley, was, emphatically, not, a, satanist, if, for, no, other, reason, than, simply, because, he, did, not, identify, himself, as, such, crowley, nevertheless, expressed, strong, anti, christian, sentiment, stating, that, he, hated, christianity, as, socialists, hate, soap, an, animosity, probably, stemming, from, his, experiences, among, the, plymouth, brethren, he, was, nevertheless, influenced, by, the, king, james, bible, especially, the, book, of, revelation, the, impact, of, which, can, be, seen, in, his, writings, he, was, also, accused, of, advocating, human, sacrifice, largely, because, of, a, passage, in, book, 4, in, which, he, stated, that, a, male, child, of, perfect, innocence, and, high, intelligence, is, the, most, satisfactory, victim, and, added, that, he, had, sacrificed, about, 150, every, year, this, was, a, tongue, in, cheek, reference, to, ejaculation, something, not, realized, by, his, critics, crowley, considered, himself, to, be, one, of, the, outstanding, figures, of, his, time, the, historian, ronald, hutton, stated, that, in, crowley, s, youth, he, was, a, self, indulgent, and, flamboyant, young, man, who, set, about, a, deliberate, flouting, and, provocation, of, social, and, religious, norms, while, being, shielded, from, an, outraged, public, opinion, by, his, inherited, wealth, hutton, also, described, crowley, as, having, both, an, unappeasable, desire, to, take, control, of, any, organisation, that, he, belonged, to, and, a, tendency, to, quarrel, savagely, with, those, who, challenged, him, crowley, biographer, martin, booth, asserted, that, crowley, was, self, confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly, intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when, it, suited, him, cruel, similarly, richard, b, spence, noted, that, crowley, was, capable, of, immense, physical, and, emotional, cruelty, biographer, lawrence, sutin, noted, that, crowley, exhibited, courage, skill, dauntless, energy, and, remarkable, focus, of, will, while, at, the, same, time, showing, a, blind, arrogance, petty, fits, of, bile, contempt, for, the, abilities, of, his, fellow, men, the, thelemite, lon, milo, duquette, noted, that, crowley, was, by, no, means, perfect, and, often, alienated, those, who, loved, him, dearest, crowley, enjoyed, being, outrageous, and, flouting, conventional, morality, with, john, symonds, noting, that, he, was, in, revolt, against, the, moral, and, religious, values, of, his, time, crowley, s, political, thought, was, studied, by, the, academic, marco, pasi, who, noted, that, for, crowley, socio, political, concerns, were, subordinate, to, metaphysical, and, spiritual, ones, he, was, neither, on, the, political, left, nor, right, but, perhaps, best, categorized, as, a, conservative, revolutionary, despite, not, being, affiliated, with, the, german, based, movement, of, the, same, name, pasi, described, crowley, s, fascination, with, the, extreme, ideologies, of, nazism, and, marxism, leninism, which, aimed, to, violently, overturn, society, what, crowley, liked, about, nazism, and, communism, or, at, least, what, made, him, curious, about, them, was, the, anti, christian, position, and, the, revolutionary, and, socially, subversive, implications, of, these, two, movements, in, their, subversive, powers, he, saw, the, possibility, of, an, annihilation, of, old, religious, traditions, and, the, creation, of, a, void, that, thelema, subsequently, would, be, able, to, fill, crowley, described, democracy, as, an, imbecile, and, nauseating, cult, of, weakness, and, commented, that, the, book, of, the, law, proclaimed, that, there, is, the, master, and, there, is, the, slave, the, noble, and, the, serf, the, lone, wolf, and, the, herd, in, this, attitude, he, was, influenced, by, social, darwinism, and, the, work, of, friedrich, nietzsche, although, he, had, contempt, for, most, of, the, british, aristocracy, he, regarded, himself, as, an, aristocrat, and, styled, himself, as, laird, boleskine, once, describing, his, ideology, as, aristocratic, communism, crowley, was, bisexual, but, exhibited, a, preference, for, women, with, his, relationships, with, men, being, fewer, and, mostly, in, the, early, part, of, his, life, in, particular, he, was, attracted, to, exotic, women, and, said, he, had, fallen, in, love, on, multiple, occasions, kaczynski, stated, that, when, he, loved, he, did, so, with, his, whole, being, but, the, passion, was, typically, short, lived, even, in, later, life, crowley, was, able, to, attract, young, bohemian, women, to, be, his, lovers, largely, due, to, his, charisma, he, applied, the, term, scarlet, woman, to, various, female, lovers, whom, he, believed, played, an, important, role, in, his, magical, work, during, homosexual, acts, he, usually, played, the, passive, role, which, booth, believed, appealed, to, his, masochistic, side, an, underlying, theme, in, many, of, his, writings, is, that, spiritual, enlightenment, arises, through, transgressing, socio, sexual, norms, crowley, advocated, complete, sexual, freedom, for, both, men, and, women, he, argued, that, homosexual, and, bisexual, people, should, not, suppress, their, sexual, orientation, commenting, that, a, person, must, not, be, ashamed, or, afraid, of, being, homosexual, if, he, happens, to, be, so, at, heart, he, must, not, attempt, to, violate, his, own, true, nature, because, of, public, opinion, or, medieval, morality, or, religious, prejudice, which, would, wish, he, were, otherwise, on, other, issues, he, adopted, a, more, conservative, attitude, he, opposed, abortion, on, moral, grounds, believing, that, no, woman, following, her, true, will, would, ever, desire, one, biographer, lawrence, sutin, stated, that, blatant, bigotry, is, a, persistent, minor, element, in, crowley, s, writings, sutin, thought, crowley, a, spoiled, scion, of, a, wealthy, victorian, family, who, embodied, many, of, the, worst, john, bull, racial, and, social, prejudices, of, his, upper, class, contemporaries, noting, that, he, embodied, the, contradiction, that, writhed, within, many, western, intellectuals, of, the, time, deeply, held, racist, viewpoints, courtesy, of, society, coupled, with, a, fascination, with, people, of, colour, crowley, is, said, to, have, insulted, his, close, jewish, friend, victor, neuburg, using, antisemitic, slurs, and, he, had, mixed, opinions, about, jewish, people, as, a, group, although, he, praised, their, sublime, poetry, and, stated, that, they, exhibited, imagination, romance, loyalty, probity, and, humanity, he, also, thought, that, centuries, of, persecution, had, led, some, jewish, people, to, exhibit, avarice, servility, falseness, cunning, and, the, rest, he, was, also, known, to, praise, various, ethnic, and, cultural, groups, for, instance, he, thought, that, the, chinese, people, exhibited, a, spiritual, superiority, to, the, english, and, praised, muslims, for, exhibiting, manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and, self, respect, both, critics, of, crowley, and, adherents, of, thelema, have, accused, crowley, of, sexism, booth, described, crowley, as, exhibiting, a, general, misogyny, something, the, biographer, believed, arose, from, crowley, s, bad, relationship, with, his, mother, sutin, noted, that, crowley, largely, accepted, the, notion, implicitly, embodied, in, victorian, sexology, of, women, as, secondary, social, beings, in, terms, of, intellect, and, sensibility, the, scholar, of, religion, manon, hedenborg, white, noted, that, some, of, crowley, s, statements, are, undoubtedly, misogynist, by, contemporary, standards, but, characterized, crowley, s, attitude, toward, women, as, complex, and, multi, faceted, crowley, s, comments, on, women, s, role, varied, dramatically, within, his, written, work, even, that, produced, in, similar, periods, crowley, described, women, as, moral, inferiors, who, had, to, be, treated, with, firmness, kindness, and, justice, while, also, arguing, that, thelema, was, essential, to, women, s, emancipation, biographers, richard, b, spence, and, tobias, churton, have, suggested, that, crowley, was, a, spy, for, the, british, secret, services, and, that, among, other, things, he, joined, the, golden, dawn, under, their, command, to, monitor, the, activities, of, mathers, who, was, known, to, be, a, carlist, spence, suggested, that, the, conflict, between, mathers, and, the, london, lodge, for, the, temple, was, part, of, an, intelligence, operation, to, undermine, mathers, authority, spence, has, suggested, that, the, purpose, of, crowley, s, trip, to, mexico, might, have, been, to, explore, mexican, oil, prospects, for, british, intelligence, spence, has, suggested, that, his, trip, to, china, was, orchestrated, as, part, of, a, british, intelligence, scheme, to, monitor, the, region, s, opium, trade, churton, suggested, that, crowley, had, travelled, to, moscow, on, the, orders, of, british, intelligence, to, spy, on, revolutionary, elements, in, the, city, spence, and, sutin, both, wrote, that, crowley, s, pro, german, work, in, the, united, states, during, world, war, i, was, actually, a, cover, for, him, being, a, double, agent, for, britain, citing, his, hyperbolic, articles, in, the, fatherland, to, make, the, german, lobby, appear, ridiculous, in, the, eyes, of, the, american, public, spence, also, wrote, that, crowley, encouraged, the, german, navy, to, destroy, the, lusitania, informing, them, that, it, would, ensure, the, us, stayed, out, of, the, war, while, in, reality, hoping, that, it, would, bring, the, us, into, the, war, on, britain, s, side, e, is, today, looked, upon, as, a, source, of, inspiration, by, many, people, in, search, of, spiritual, enlightenment, and, or, instructions, in, magical, practice, thus, while, during, his, life, his, books, hardly, sold, and, his, disciples, were, never, very, numerous, nowadays, all, his, important, works, are, constantly, in, print, and, the, people, defining, themselves, as, thelemites, that, is, followers, of, crowley, s, new, religion, number, several, thousands, all, over, the, world, furthermore, crowley, s, influence, over, magically, oriented, new, religious, movements, has, in, some, cases, been, very, deep, and,
