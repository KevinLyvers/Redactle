looked, to, expand, over, the, next, ten, years, he, founded, the, pagan, empire, the, irrawaddy, valley, at, the, core, surrounded, by, tributary, kingdoms, estimates, of, the, extent, of, his, empire, vary, greatly, the, burmese, and, thai, chronicles, report, an, empire, which, covered, present, day, myanmar, and, northern, thailand, the, thai, chronicles, assert, that, anawrahta, conquered, the, entire, menam, valley, and, received, tribute, from, the, khmer, king, one, states, that, anawrahta, s, armies, invaded, the, khmer, kingdom, and, sacked, the, city, of, angkor, and, another, one, goes, so, far, as, to, say, that, anawrahta, even, visited, java, to, receive, his, tribute, however, western, historians, harvey, hall, et, al, present, a, much, smaller, empire, consisted, of, the, irrawaddy, valley, and, nearer, periphery, his, victory, terracotta, votive, tablets, emblazoned, with, his, name, in, sanskrit, have, been, found, along, the, tenasserim, coastline, in, the, south, katha, in, the, north, thazi, in, the, east, and, minbu, in, the, west, his, first, efforts, were, in, then, lightly, inhabited, shan, hills, in, the, east, and, the, north, he, acquired, allegiance, of, shan, hills, in, two, waves, in, the, early, to, mid, 1050s, anawrahta, first, visited, the, nearer, shan, hills, in, the, east, and, received, tribute, he, founded, the, bawrithat, pagoda, in, nyaungshwe, the, second, wave, came, in, the, late, 1050s, and, early, 1060s, after, his, march, to, nanzhao, kingdom, after, his, return, from, nanzhao, expedition, shan, chiefs, along, the, route, presented, anawrahta, with, tributes, still, their, allegiance, was, nominal, and, he, had, to, establish, 43, forts, along, the, eastern, foothills, of, which, the, following, 33, still, exist, as, villages, the, 43, forts, were, established, per, the, royal, order, issued, 7, february, 1061, 12th, waxing, of, tabaung, 422, me, after, his, first, shan, campaign, anawrahta, turned, to, the, mon, speaking, kingdoms, in, the, south, which, like, pagan, were, merely, large, city, states, in, reality, he, first, received, submission, of, the, ruler, of, pegu, bago, but, the, thaton, kingdom, refused, to, submit, anawrahta, s, armies, led, by, the, four, paladins, invaded, the, southern, kingdom, in, early, 1057, after, a, 3, months, siege, of, the, city, of, thaton, on, 17, may, 1057, 11th, waxing, of, nayon, 419, me, the, pagan, forces, conquered, the, city, according, to, burmese, and, mon, traditions, anawrahta, s, main, reason, for, the, invasion, was, thaton, king, manuha, s, refusal, to, give, him, a, copy, of, the, theravada, buddhist, canon, anawrahta, had, been, converted, to, theravada, buddhism, from, his, native, ari, buddhism, by, shin, arahan, a, monk, originally, from, thaton, in, reality, it, was, merely, a, demand, for, submission, couched, in, diplomatic, language, and, the, real, aim, of, his, conquest, of, thaton, was, to, check, the, khmer, empire, s, conquests, in, the, chao, phraya, basin, and, encroachment, into, the, tenasserim, coast, the, conquest, of, thaton, is, seen, as, the, turning, point, in, burmese, history, still, according, to, traditional, reconstruction, anawrahta, brought, back, over, 30, 000, people, many, of, them, artisans, and, craftsmen, to, pagan, these, captives, formed, a, community, that, later, helped, build, thousands, of, monuments, at, pagan, the, remains, of, which, today, rival, the, splendors, of, angkor, wat, more, recent, research, by, historian, michael, aung, thwin, has, argued, forcefully, that, thaton, s, contributions, to, the, cultural, transformation, of, upper, burma, are, a, post, pagan, legend, without, contemporary, evidence, that, lower, burma, in, fact, lacked, a, substantial, independent, polity, prior, to, pagan, s, expansion, and, that, mon, influence, on, the, interior, is, greatly, exaggerated, possibly, in, this, period, the, delta, sedimentation, which, now, extends, the, coastline, by, three, miles, a, century, remained, insufficient, and, the, sea, still, reached, too, far, inland, to, support, a, population, even, as, large, as, the, modest, population, of, the, late, precolonial, era, at, any, rate, during, the, 11th, century, pagan, established, its, lower, burma, and, this, conquest, facilitated, growing, cultural, exchange, if, not, with, local, mons, then, with, india, and, with, theravada, stronghold, ceylon, sri, lanka, anawrahta, s, next, conquest, was, north, arakan, rakhine, he, marched, over, the, pass, from, ngape, near, minbu, to, an, in, kyaukphyu, and, then, laid, siege, to, pyinsa, then, the, capital, of, arakan, he, reportedly, tried, to, bring, home, the, giant, mahamuni, buddha, but, could, not, he, did, take, away, the, gold, and, silver, vessels, of, the, shrine, there, is, no, single, unified, arakanese, account, to, corroborate, the, event, surviving, arakanese, chronicles, from, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, mention, at, least, two, separate, raids, from, the, east, as, well, as, visits, by, anawrahta, and, kyansittha, according, to, the, arakanese, accounts, the, attacks, from, the, east, ousted, kings, pe, byu, and, nga, ton, in, succession, however, the, dates, are, off, by, centuries, with, the, ousted, kings, having, reigned, in, the, late, 8th, to, early, 9th, centuries, 10th, to, 11th, or, 11th, to, 12th, centuries, at, any, rate, as, was, the, case, with, the, shan, hills, anawrahta, s, suzerainty, over, north, arakan, separated, by, the, arakan, yoma, range, was, nominal, the, conquest, may, have, been, more, of, a, raid, to, prevent, arakanese, raids, into, burma, and, some, historians, lieberman, charney, do, not, believe, he, or, any, other, pagan, kings, had, any, effective, authority, over, arakan, if, pagan, never, established, an, administrative, system, to, govern, arakan, it, continued, to, foster, a, vassal, relationship, for, the, remainder, of, pagan, dynasty, occasionally, placing, its, nominees, to, the, arakanese, throne, moreover, the, burmese, language, and, script, came, to, dominate, the, arakan, littoral, over, the, next, centuries, with, burmese, influence, came, ties, to, ceylon, sri, lanka, and, the, gradual, prominence, of, theravada, buddhism, anawrahta, also, received, tribute, from, the, buddhist, kingdom, of, pateikkaya, ipa, the, location, of, the, small, kingdom, remains, in, dispute, the, burmese, chronicles, report, the, location, as, northwest, of, arakan, and, its, kings, indian, but, british, historian, ge, harvey, reckoned, that, it, was, more, likely, nearer, to, the, eastern, chin, hills, the, tripura, state, was, described, as, patikara, in, maharajoang, an, ancient, historical, book, of, bramhadesh, as, his, kingdom, expanded, anawrahta, came, into, contact, with, the, dali, kingdom, the, erstwhile, home, of, the, burmans, in, the, northeast, and, in, the, southeast, the, khmer, empire, the, main, power, of, mainland, southeast, asia, at, the, time, he, assisted, fellow, theravada, buddhist, ceylon, in, its, war, against, hindu, chola, invaders, pagan, s, conquest, of, thaton, shook, the, mon, world, anawrahta, also, demanded, tribute, from, other, neighboring, mon, kingdoms, haripunjaya, and, dvaravati, in, present, day, northern, and, central, thailand, haripunjaya, reportedly, sent, in, tribute, but, dvaravati, s, overlord, khmer, empire, instead, invaded, tenasserim, anawrahta, sent, his, armies, again, led, by, the, four, paladins, who, repulsed, the, invaders, the, burmese, chronicles, referred, to, the, kingdom, of, cambodia, as, the, southeastern, limit, of, the, pagan, empire, after, the, khmer, advance, was, checked, anawrahta, turned, his, attention, toward, dali, anawrahta, led, a, campaign, against, the, kingdom, in, the, northeast, according, to, a, mid, 17th, century, source, he, began, the, march, on, 16, december, 1057, he, advanced, to, dali, the, capital, of, dali, kingdom, ostensibly, to, seek, a, buddha, s, tooth, relic, as, in, the, case, of, the, request, for, the, scriptures, from, thaton, it, was, really, a, demand, for, tribute, the, ruler, of, dali, shut, the, gates, and, would, not, give, up, the, relic, after, a, long, pause, two, kings, exchanged, presents, and, conversed, amicably, the, dali, ruler, gave, anawrahta, a, jade, image, which, had, come, into, contact, with, the, tooth, in, 1069, vijayabahu, i, of, ceylon, asked, anawrahta, for, aid, against, the, chola, invaders, from, tamil, country, anawrahta, sent, ships, of, supplies, in, aid, of, buddhist, ceylon, in, 1071, vijayabahu, who, had, defeated, the, cholas, asked, anawrahta, for, buddhist, scriptures, and, buddhist, monks, the, chola, invasions, had, left, the, original, home, of, theravada, buddhism, with, so, few, monks, that, it, was, hard, to, convene, a, chapter, and, make, valid, ordinations, anawrahta, sent, the, monks, and, scriptures, and, a, white, elephant, as, a, present, for, vijayabahu, the, burmese, monks, ordained, or, re, ordained, the, entire, clergy, of, the, island, in, return, the, ceylonese, king, gave, a, replica, of, the, buddha, tooth, of, which, ceylon, was, the, proud, possessor, the, replica, was, then, enshrined, in, the, lawkananda, pagoda, in, pagan, the, greatest, achievement, of, anawrahta, was, his, consolidation, of, various, ethnic, groups, into, a, single, nation, he, was, careful, that, his, own, people, the, burmans, not, flaunt, themselves, before, other, peoples, he, continued, to, show, regard, for, the, pyus, who, had, recently, fallen, from, greatness, he, retained, the, name, pyu, for, his, kingdom, although, it, was, under, the, leadership, of, the, burmans, he, showed, regard, for, the, mons, and, encouraged, his, people, to, learn, from, the, mons, anawrahta, replaced, the, kings, of, lower, burma, pegu, and, thaton, with, governors, at, pegu, he, allowed, the, king, of, pegu, to, remain, as, a, vassal, king, in, appreciation, of, the, latter, s, help, in, anawrahta, s, conquest, of, thaton, but, after, the, vassal, king, s, death, he, appointed, a, governor, due, to, geographical, distances, other, tributary, areas, such, as, arakan, and, shan, hills, were, allowed, to, retain, hereditary, chieftainships, in, 1056, a, mon, theravada, buddhist, monk, named, shin, arahan, made, a, fateful, visit, to, pagan, and, converted, its, king, anawrahta, to, theravada, buddhism, from, his, native, ari, buddhism, the, king, had, been, dissatisfied, with, the, enormous, power, of, ari, monks, over, the, people, and, considered, the, monks, who, ate, evening, meals, drank, liquor, presided, over, animal, sacrifices, and, enjoyed, a, form, of, ius, primae, noctis, depraved, in, theravada, buddhism, he, found, a, substitute, to, break, the, power, of, the, clergy, from, 1056, onwards, anawrahta, implemented, a, series, of, religious, reforms, throughout, his, kingdom, his, reforms, gained, steam, after, his, conquest, of, thaton, which, brought, much, needed, scriptures, and, clergy, from, the, vanquished, kingdom, he, broke, the, power, of, the, ari, monks, first, by, declaring, that, his, court, would, no, longer, heed, if, people, ceased, to, yield, their, children, to, the, priests, those, who, were, in, bondage, of, the, priests, gained, freedom, some, of, the, monks, simply, disrobed, or, followed, the, new, way, however, the, majority, of, the, monks, who, had, wielded, power, for, so, long, would, not, go, away, easily, anawrahta, banished, them, in, numbers, many, of, them, fled, to, popa, hill, and, the, shan, hills, he, used, traditional, nat, spirits, to, attract, people, to, his, new, religion, asked, why, he, allowed, the, nats, to, be, placed, in, buddhist, temples, and, pagodas, anawrahta, answered, men, will, not, come, for, the, sake, of, new, faith, let, them, come, for, their, old, gods, and, gradually, they, will, be, won, over, urged, on, by, shin, arahan, anawrahta, tried, to, reform, the, very, theravada, buddhism, he, received, from, thaton, which, by, most, accounts, was, in, a, state, of, decay, and, increasingly, influenced, by, hinduism, the, mon, chronicles, hint, that, manuha, was, reprehensible, for, making, a, compromise, with, hinduism, shin, arahan, left, thaton, because, he, was, unhappy, with, the, decaying, of, buddhism, there, he, made, pagan, a, center, of, theravada, learning, by, inviting, scholars, from, the, mon, lands, ceylon, as, well, as, from, india, where, a, dying, buddhism, was, being, given, a, coup, de, grace, by, hindu, forces, the, scholarship, helped, revitalize, a, more, orthodox, form, of, theravada, buddhism, to, be, sure, his, reforms, could, not, and, did, not, achieve, everything, overnight, the, spread, of, theravada, buddhism, in, upper, burma, was, gradual, it, took, over, three, centuries, its, monastic, system, did, not, achieve, widespread, village, level, penetration, in, more, remote, areas, until, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, nor, did, the, aris, die, out, their, descendants, known, as, forest, dwelling, monks, remained, a, powerful, force, patronized, by, the, royalty, down, to, the, ava, period, in, the, 16th, century, likewise, the, nat, worship, continued, down, to, the, present, day, even, the, theravada, buddhism, of, anawrahta, kyansittha, and, manuha, was, one, still, strongly, influenced, by, hinduism, when, compared, to, later, more, orthodox, 18th, and, 19th, century, standards, tantric, saivite, and, vaishnava, elements, enjoyed, greater, elite, influence, than, they, would, later, do, reflecting, both, the, relative, immaturity, of, early, burmese, literacy, culture, and, its, indiscriminate, receptivity, to, non, burman, traditions, indeed, even, today, s, burmese, buddhism, contains, many, animist, mahayana, buddhist, and, hindu, elements, he, was, the, first, of, the, temple, builders, of, pagan, his, chief, monument, was, the, shwezigon, pagoda, the, work, began, in, 1059, but, was, still, unfinished, at, his, death, 18, years, later, he, also, built, the, shwesandaw, pagoda, south, of, pagan, to, house, the, hair, relics, presented, by, pegu, farther, afield, he, built, other, pagodas, such, as, shweyinhmyaw, shwegu, and, shwezigon, near, meiktila, scholarship, believed, until, recently, that, anawrahta, commissioned, the, invention, of, the, burmese, alphabet, based, on, the, mon, script, c, 1058, a, year, after, the, thaton, conquest, however, recent, research, finds, that, the, burmese, alphabet, had, been, in, use, at, least, since, 1035, and, if, an, 18th, century, recast, inscription, is, permissible, as, evidence, since, 984, ce, anawrahta, was, an, energetic, king, who, implemented, many, profound, enduring, political, socioeconomic, and, cultural, changes, he, was, admired, and, feared, but, not, loved, by, his, subjects, historian, htin, aung, writes, anawrahta, was, ruthless, and, stern, not, to, any, particular, ethnic, group, but, to, all, his, subjects, for, he, felt, that, harsh, measures, were, needed, in, building, up, a, new, nation, he, never, accepted, the, cult, of, the, god, king, and, he, was, impatient, even, with, gods, that, his, people, worshipped, men, came, to, say, that, he, beat, up, gods, with, the, flat, of, his, lance, he, achieved, his, aims, but, only, at, the, price, of, his, own, popularity, his, subjects, admired, and, feared, him, but, did, not, love, him, his, execution, of, two, young, heroes, for, a, trifling, breach, of, discipline, after, the, conclusion, of, his, nanzhao, campaign, angered, people, and, to, appease, them, he, declared, that, the, two,
