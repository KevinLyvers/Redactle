gustav, robert, kirchhoff, german, 12, march, 1824, 17, october, 1887, was, a, german, physicist, and, mathematician, who, contributed, to, the, fundamental, understanding, of, electrical, circuits, spectroscopy, and, the, emission, of, black, body, radiation, by, heated, objects, he, coined, the, term, black, body, radiation, in, 1860, several, different, sets, of, concepts, are, named, kirchhoff, s, laws, after, him, which, include, kirchhoff, s, circuit, laws, kirchhoff, s, law, of, thermal, radiation, and, kirchhoff, s, law, of, thermochemistry, the, bunsen, kirchhoff, award, for, spectroscopy, is, named, after, kirchhoff, and, his, colleague, robert, bunsen, gustav, kirchhoff, was, born, on, 12, march, 1824, in, k, nigsberg, prussia, the, son, of, friedrich, kirchhoff, a, lawyer, and, johanna, henriette, wittke, his, family, were, lutherans, in, the, evangelical, church, of, prussia, he, graduated, from, the, albertus, university, of, k, nigsberg, in, 1847, where, he, attended, the, mathematico, physical, seminar, directed, by, carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, franz, ernst, neumann, and, friedrich, julius, richelot, in, the, same, year, he, moved, to, berlin, where, he, stayed, until, he, received, a, professorship, at, breslau, later, in, 1857, he, married, clara, richelot, the, daughter, of, his, mathematics, professor, richelot, the, couple, had, five, children, clara, died, in, 1869, he, married, luise, br, mmel, in, 1872, kirchhoff, formulated, his, circuit, laws, which, are, now, ubiquitous, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1845, while, he, was, still, a, student, he, completed, this, study, as, a, seminar, exercise, it, later, became, his, doctoral, dissertation, he, was, called, to, the, university, of, heidelberg, in, 1854, where, he, collaborated, in, spectroscopic, work, with, robert, bunsen, in, 1857, he, calculated, that, an, electric, signal, in, a, resistanceless, wire, travels, along, the, wire, at, the, speed, of, light, he, proposed, his, law, of, thermal, radiation, in, 1859, and, gave, a, proof, in, 1861, together, kirchhoff, and, bunsen, invented, the, spectroscope, which, kirchhoff, used, to, pioneer, the, identification, of, the, elements, in, the, sun, showing, in, 1859, that, the, sun, contains, sodium, he, and, bunsen, discovered, caesium, and, rubidium, in, 1861, at, heidelberg, he, ran, a, mathematico, physical, seminar, modelled, on, franz, ernst, neumann, s, with, the, mathematician, leo, koenigsberger, among, those, who, attended, this, seminar, were, arthur, schuster, and, sofia, kovalevskaya, he, contributed, greatly, to, the, field, of, spectroscopy, by, formalizing, three, laws, that, describe, the, spectral, composition, of, light, emitted, by, incandescent, objects, building, substantially, on, the, discoveries, of, david, alter, and, anders, jonas, ngstr, m, in, 1862, he, was, awarded, the, rumford, medal, for, his, researches, on, the, fixed, lines, of, the, solar, spectrum, and, on, the, inversion, of, the, bright, lines, in, the, spectra, of, artificial, light, in, 1875, kirchhoff, accepted, the, first, chair, dedicated, specifically, to, theoretical, physics, at, berlin, he, also, contributed, to, optics, carefully, solving, the, wave, equation, to, provide, a, solid, foundation, for, huygens, principle, and, correct, it, in, the, process, in, 1864, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1884, he, became, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, kirchhoff, died, in, 1887, and, was, buried, in, the, st, matth, us, kirchhof, cemetery, in, sch, neberg, berlin, just, a, few, meters, from, the, graves, of, the, brothers, grimm, leopold, kronecker, is, buried, in, the, same, cemetery, kirchhoff, s, first, law, is, that, the, algebraic, sum, of, currents, in, a, network, of, conductors, meeting, at, a, point, or, node, is, zero, the, second, law, is, that, in, a, closed, circuit, the, directed, sums, of, the, voltages, in, the, system, is, zero, kirchhoff, did, not, know, about, the, existence, of, energy, levels, in, atoms, the, existence, of, discrete, spectral, lines, was, known, since, fraunhofer, discovered, them, in, 1814, and, that, the, lines, formed, a, discrete, mathematical, pattern, was, described, by, johann, balmer, in, 1885, joseph, larmor, explained, the, splitting, of, the, spectral, lines, in, a, magnetic, field, known, as, the, zeeman, effect, by, the, oscillation, of, electrons, but, these, discrete, spectral, lines, were, not, explained, as, electron, transitions, until, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, in, 1913, which, helped, lead, to, quantum, mechanics, it, was, kirchhoff, s, law, of, thermal, radiation, in, which, he, proposed, an, unknown, universal, law, for, radiation, that, led, max, planck, to, the, discovery, of, the, quantum, of, action, leading, to, quantum, mechanics, kirchhoff, showed, in, 1858, that, in, thermochemistry, the, variation, of, the, heat, of, a, chemical, reaction, is, given, by, the, difference, in, heat, capacity, between, products, and, reactants, integration, of, this, equation, permits, the, evaluation, of, the, heat, of, reaction, at, one, temperature, from, measurements, at, another, temperature, kirchhoff, also, worked, in, the, mathematical, field, of, graph, theory, in, which, he, proved, kirchhoff, s, matrix, tree, theorem
