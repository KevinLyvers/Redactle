aelius, galenus, or, claudius, galenus, greek, september, 129, 216, ad, often, anglicized, as, galen, e, l, n, or, galen, of, pergamon, was, a, roman, and, greek, physician, surgeon, and, philosopher, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, accomplished, of, all, medical, researchers, of, antiquity, galen, influenced, the, development, of, various, scientific, disciplines, including, anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and, neurology, as, well, as, philosophy, and, logic, the, son, of, aelius, nicon, a, wealthy, greek, architect, with, scholarly, interests, galen, received, a, comprehensive, education, that, prepared, him, for, a, successful, career, as, a, physician, and, philosopher, born, in, the, ancient, city, of, pergamon, present, day, bergama, turkey, galen, traveled, extensively, exposing, himself, to, a, wide, variety, of, medical, theories, and, discoveries, before, settling, in, rome, where, he, served, prominent, members, of, roman, society, and, eventually, was, given, the, position, of, personal, physician, to, several, emperors, galen, s, understanding, of, anatomy, and, medicine, was, principally, influenced, by, the, then, current, theory, of, the, four, humors, black, bile, yellow, bile, blood, and, phlegm, as, first, advanced, by, the, author, of, on, the, nature, of, man, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, galen, s, views, dominated, and, influenced, western, medical, science, for, more, than, 1, 300, years, his, anatomical, reports, were, based, mainly, on, the, dissection, of, barbary, apes, however, when, he, discovered, that, their, facial, expressions, were, too, much, like, those, of, humans, he, switched, to, other, animals, such, as, pigs, while, dissections, and, vivisections, on, humans, were, practised, in, alexandria, at, this, time, galen, did, not, have, imperial, permission, to, perform, his, own, and, had, to, use, animals, instead, galen, would, encourage, his, students, to, go, look, at, dead, gladiators, or, bodies, that, washed, up, in, order, to, get, better, acquainted, with, the, human, body, his, anatomical, reports, remained, uncontested, until, 1543, when, printed, descriptions, and, illustrations, of, human, dissections, were, published, in, the, seminal, work, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, by, andreas, vesalius, where, galen, s, physiological, theory, was, accommodated, to, these, new, observations, galen, s, theory, of, the, physiology, of, the, circulatory, system, remained, unchallenged, until, c, 1242, when, ibn, al, nafis, published, his, book, sharh, tashrih, al, qanun, li, ibn, sina, commentary, on, anatomy, in, avicenna, s, canon, in, which, he, reported, his, discovery, of, pulmonary, circulation, galen, saw, himself, as, both, a, physician, and, a, philosopher, as, he, wrote, in, his, treatise, titled, that, the, best, physician, is, also, a, philosopher, galen, was, very, interested, in, the, debate, between, the, rationalist, and, empiricist, medical, sects, and, his, use, of, direct, observation, dissection, and, vivisection, represents, a, complex, middle, ground, between, the, extremes, of, those, two, viewpoints, many, of, his, works, have, been, preserved, and, or, translated, from, the, original, greek, although, many, were, destroyed, and, some, credited, to, him, are, believed, to, be, spurious, although, there, is, some, debate, over, the, date, of, his, death, he, was, no, younger, than, seventy, when, he, died, galen, s, greek, name, gal, n, s, comes, from, the, adjective, gal, n, s, calm, galen, s, latin, name, aelius, or, claudius, implies, he, had, roman, citizenship, galen, describes, his, early, life, in, on, the, affections, of, the, mind, he, was, born, in, september, 129, ad, his, father, aelius, nicon, was, a, wealthy, patrician, an, architect, and, builder, with, eclectic, interests, including, philosophy, mathematics, logic, astronomy, agriculture, and, literature, galen, describes, his, father, as, a, highly, amiable, just, good, and, benevolent, man, at, that, time, pergamon, modern, day, bergama, turkey, was, a, major, cultural, and, intellectual, centre, noted, for, its, library, second, only, to, that, in, alexandria, as, well, as, being, the, site, of, a, large, temple, to, the, healing, god, asclepius, the, city, attracted, both, stoic, and, platonic, philosophers, to, whom, galen, was, exposed, at, age, 14, his, studies, also, took, in, each, of, the, principal, philosophical, systems, of, the, time, including, aristotelian, and, epicurean, his, father, had, planned, a, traditional, career, for, galen, in, philosophy, or, politics, and, took, care, to, expose, him, to, literary, and, philosophical, influences, however, galen, states, that, in, around, 145, his, father, had, a, dream, in, which, the, god, asclepius, appeared, and, commanded, nicon, to, send, his, son, to, study, medicine, following, his, earlier, liberal, education, galen, at, age, 16, began, his, studies, at, the, prestigious, local, healing, temple, or, asclepeion, as, a, therapeutes, or, attendant, for, four, years, there, he, came, under, the, influence, of, men, like, aeschrion, of, pergamon, stratonicus, and, satyrus, asclepiea, functioned, as, spas, or, sanitoria, to, which, the, sick, would, come, to, seek, the, ministrations, of, the, priesthood, romans, frequented, the, temple, at, pergamon, in, search, of, medical, relief, from, illness, and, disease, it, was, also, the, haunt, of, notable, people, such, as, the, historian, claudius, charax, the, orator, aelius, aristides, the, sophist, polemo, and, the, consul, cuspius, rufinus, galen, s, father, died, in, 148, leaving, galen, independently, wealthy, at, the, age, of, 19, he, then, followed, the, advice, he, found, in, hippocrates, teaching, and, traveled, and, studied, widely, including, such, destinations, as, smyrna, now, zmir, corinth, crete, cilicia, now, ukurova, cyprus, and, finally, the, great, medical, school, of, alexandria, exposing, himself, to, the, various, schools, of, thought, in, medicine, in, 157, aged, 28, he, returned, to, pergamon, as, physician, to, the, gladiators, of, the, high, priest, of, asia, one, of, the, most, influential, and, wealthy, men, in, asia, galen, claims, that, the, high, priest, chose, him, over, other, physicians, after, he, eviscerated, an, ape, and, challenged, other, physicians, to, repair, the, damage, when, they, refused, galen, performed, the, surgery, himself, and, in, so, doing, won, the, favor, of, the, high, priest, of, asia, over, his, four, years, there, he, learned, the, importance, of, diet, fitness, hygiene, and, preventive, measures, as, well, as, living, anatomy, and, the, treatment, of, fractures, and, severe, trauma, referring, to, their, wounds, as, windows, into, the, body, only, five, deaths, among, the, gladiators, occurred, while, he, held, the, post, compared, to, sixty, in, his, predecessor, s, time, a, result, that, is, in, general, ascribed, to, the, attention, he, paid, to, their, wounds, at, the, same, time, he, pursued, studies, in, theoretical, medicine, and, philosophy, galen, went, to, rome, in, 162, and, made, his, mark, as, a, practicing, physician, his, public, demonstrations, and, impatience, with, alternative, views, on, medicine, brought, him, into, conflict, with, other, doctors, practicing, in, the, city, when, the, peripatetic, philosopher, eudemus, became, ill, with, quartan, fever, galen, felt, obliged, to, treat, him, since, he, was, my, teacher, and, i, happened, to, live, nearby, he, wrote, i, return, to, the, case, of, eudemus, he, was, thoroughly, attacked, by, the, three, attacks, of, quartan, ague, and, the, doctors, had, given, him, up, as, it, was, now, mid, winter, some, roman, physicians, criticized, galen, for, his, use, of, the, prognosis, in, his, treatment, of, eudemus, this, practice, conflicted, with, the, then, current, standard, of, care, which, relied, upon, divination, and, mysticism, galen, retaliated, against, his, detractors, by, defending, his, own, methods, garcia, ballester, quotes, galen, as, saying, in, order, to, diagnose, one, must, observe, and, reason, this, was, the, basis, of, his, criticism, of, the, doctors, who, proceeded, alogos, and, askeptos, however, eudemus, warned, galen, that, engaging, in, conflict, with, these, physicians, could, lead, to, his, assassination, eudemus, said, this, and, more, to, the, same, effect, he, added, that, if, they, were, not, able, to, harm, me, by, unscrupulous, conduct, they, would, proceed, to, attempts, at, poisoning, among, other, things, he, told, me, that, some, ten, years, before, a, young, man, had, come, to, the, city, and, had, given, like, me, practical, demonstrations, of, the, resources, of, our, art, this, young, man, was, put, to, death, by, poison, together, with, two, servants, who, accompanied, him, when, galen, s, animosity, with, the, roman, medical, practitioners, became, serious, he, feared, he, might, be, exiled, or, poisoned, so, he, left, the, city, rome, was, engaged, in, foreign, wars, in, 161, marcus, aurelius, and, his, then, co, emperor, and, adoptive, brother, lucius, verus, were, in, the, north, fighting, the, marcomanni, during, the, autumn, of, 169, when, roman, troops, were, returning, to, aquileia, a, great, plague, most, likely, one, the, first, appearances, of, smallpox, then, referred, to, as, the, antonine, plague, in, the, mediterranean, world, broke, out, and, the, emperor, summoned, galen, back, to, rome, he, was, ordered, to, accompany, marcus, and, verus, to, germany, as, the, court, physician, the, following, spring, marcus, was, persuaded, to, release, galen, after, receiving, a, report, that, asclepius, was, against, the, project, he, was, left, behind, to, act, as, physician, to, the, imperial, heir, commodus, it, was, here, in, court, that, galen, wrote, extensively, on, medical, subjects, ironically, lucius, verus, died, in, 169, and, marcus, aurelius, himself, died, in, 180, both, victims, of, the, plague, galen, was, the, physician, to, commodus, for, much, of, the, emperor, s, life, and, treated, his, common, illnesses, according, to, dio, cassius, 72, 14, 3, 4, in, about, 189, under, commodus, reign, a, pestilence, occurred, which, at, its, height, killed, 2, 000, people, a, day, in, rome, this, was, most, likely, the, same, plague, the, so, called, antonine, plague, and, most, likely, smallpox, that, struck, rome, during, marcus, aurelius, reign, galen, was, also, physician, to, septimius, severus, during, his, reign, in, rome, he, complimented, severus, and, caracalla, on, keeping, a, supply, of, drugs, for, their, friends, and, mentioned, three, cases, in, which, they, had, been, of, use, in, 198, the, antonine, plague, was, named, after, marcus, aurelius, family, name, of, antoninus, it, was, also, known, as, the, plague, of, galen, and, held, an, important, place, in, medicinal, history, because, of, its, association, with, galen, he, had, first, hand, knowledge, of, the, disease, and, was, present, in, rome, when, it, first, struck, in, 166, and, was, also, present, in, the, winter, of, 168, 69, during, an, outbreak, among, troops, stationed, at, aquileia, he, had, experience, with, the, epidemic, referring, to, it, as, very, long, lasting, and, described, its, symptoms, and, his, treatment, of, it, his, references, to, the, plague, are, scattered, and, brief, galen, was, not, trying, to, present, a, description, of, the, disease, so, that, it, could, be, recognized, in, future, generations, he, was, more, interested, in, the, treatment, and, physical, effects, of, the, disease, for, example, in, his, writings, about, a, young, man, afflicted, with, the, plague, he, concentrated, on, the, treatment, of, internal, and, external, ulcerations, according, to, niebuhr, this, pestilence, must, have, raged, with, incredible, fury, it, carried, off, innumerable, victims, the, ancient, world, never, recovered, from, the, blow, inflicted, upon, it, by, the, plague, that, visited, it, in, the, reign, of, m, aurelius, the, mortality, rate, of, the, plague, was, 7, 10, percent, the, outbreak, in, 165, 168, would, have, caused, approximately, 3, 5, to, 5, million, deaths, otto, seeck, believes, that, over, half, the, population, of, the, empire, perished, j, f, gilliam, believes, that, the, antonine, plague, probably, caused, more, deaths, than, any, other, epidemic, during, the, empire, before, the, mid, 3rd, century, although, galen, s, description, is, incomplete, it, is, sufficient, to, enable, a, firm, identification, of, the, disease, as, related, to, smallpox, galen, notes, that, the, exanthema, covered, the, victim, s, entire, body, and, was, usually, black, the, exanthem, became, rough, and, scabby, where, there, was, no, ulceration, he, states, that, those, who, were, going, to, survive, developed, a, black, exanthem, according, to, galen, it, was, black, because, of, a, remnant, of, blood, putrefied, in, a, fever, blister, that, was, pustular, his, writings, state, that, raised, blisters, were, present, in, the, antonine, plague, usually, in, the, form, of, a, blistery, rash, galen, states, that, the, skin, rash, was, close, to, the, one, thucydides, described, galen, describes, symptoms, of, the, alimentary, tract, via, a, patient, s, diarrhea, and, stools, if, the, stool, was, very, black, the, patient, died, he, says, that, the, amount, of, black, stools, varied, it, depended, on, the, severity, of, the, intestinal, lesions, he, observes, that, in, cases, where, the, stool, was, not, black, the, black, exanthema, appeared, galen, describes, the, symptoms, of, fever, vomiting, fetid, breath, catarrh, cough, and, ulceration, of, the, larynx, and, trachea, galen, continued, to, work, and, write, in, his, final, years, finishing, treatises, on, drugs, and, remedies, as, well, as, his, compendium, of, diagnostics, and, therapeutics, which, would, have, much, influence, as, a, medical, text, both, in, the, latin, middle, ages, and, medieval, islam, the, 11th, century, suda, lexicon, states, that, galen, died, at, the, age, of, 70, which, would, place, his, death, in, about, the, year, 199, however, there, is, a, reference, in, galen, s, treatise, on, theriac, to, piso, which, may, however, be, spurious, to, events, of, 204, there, are, also, statements, in, arabic, sources, that, he, died, in, sicily, at, age, 87, after, 17, years, studying, medicine, and, 70, practicing, it, which, would, mean, he, died, about, 216, according, to, these, sources, the, tomb, of, galenus, in, palermo, was, still, well, preserved, in, the, tenth, century, nutton, believes, that, on, theriac, to, piso, is, genuine, that, the, arabic, sources, are, correct, and, that, the, suda, has, erroneously, interpreted, the, 70, years, of, galen, s, career, in, the, arabic, tradition, as, referring, to, his, whole, lifespan, boudon, millot, more, or, less, concurs, and, favors, a, date, of, 216, galen, contributed, a, substantial, amount, to, the, understanding, of, pathology, under, the, hippocratic, bodily, humors, theory, differences, in, human, moods, come, as, a, consequence, of, imbalances, in, one, of, the, four, bodily, fluids, blood, yellow, bile, black, bile, and, phlegm, galen, promoted, this, theory, and, the, typology, of, human, temperaments, in, galen, s, view, an, imbalance, of, each, humor, corresponded, with, a, particular, human, temperament, blood, sanguine, black, bile, melancholic, yellow, bile, choleric, and, phlegm, phlegmatic, thus, individuals, with, sanguine, temperaments, are, extroverted, and, social, choleric, people, have, energy, passion, and, charisma, melancholics, are, creative, kind, and, considerate, and, phlegmatic, temperaments, are, characterised, by, dependability, kindness, and, affection, galen, was, also, a, skilled, surgeon, operating, on, human, patients, many, of, his, procedures, and, techniques, would, not, be, used, again, for, centuries, such, as, the, procedures, he, performed, on, brains, and, eyes, his, surgical, experiments, included, ligating, the, arteries, of, living, animals, although, many, 20th, century, historians, have, claimed, that, galen, believed, the, lens, to, be, in, the, exact, center, of, the, eye, galen, actually, understood, that, the, crystalline, lens, is, located, in, the, anterior, aspect, of, the, human, eye, at, first, reluctantly, but, then, with, increasing, vigor, galen, promoted, hippocratic, teaching, including, venesection, and, bloodletting, then, unknown, in, rome, this, was, sharply, criticized, by, the, erasistrateans, who, predicted, dire, outcomes, believing, that, it, was, not, blood, but, pneuma, that, flowed, in, the, veins, galen, however, staunchly, defended, venesection, in, his, three, books, on, the, subject, and, in, his, demonstrations, and, public, disputations, galen, s, work, on, anatomy, remained, largely, unsurpassed, and, unchallenged, up, until, the, 16th, century, in, europe, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, the, anatomist, andreas, vesalius, challenged, the, anatomical, knowledge, of, galen, by, conducting, dissections, on, human, cadavers, these, investigations, allowed, vesalius, to, refute, aspects, of, galen, s, theories, regarding, anatomy, galen, s, interest, in, human, anatomy, ran, afoul, of, roman, law, that, prohibited, the, dissection, of, human, cadavers, since, roughly, 150, bc, because, of, this, restriction, galen, performed, anatomical, dissections, on, living, vivisection, and, dead, animals, mostly, focusing, on, primates, galen, believed, that, the, anatomical, structures, of, these, animals, closely, mirrored, those, of, humans, galen, clarified, the, anatomy, of, the, trachea, and, was, the, first, to, demonstrate, that, the, larynx, generates, the, voice, in, one, experiment, galen, used, bellows, to, inflate, the, lungs, of, a, dead, animal, galen, s, research, on, physiology, was, largely, influenced, by, previous, works, of, philosophers, plato, and, aristotle, as, well, as, from, the, physician, hippocrates, he, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, use, experiments, as, a, method, of, research, for, his, medical, findings, doing, so, allowed, him, to, explore, various, parts, of, the, body, and, its, functions, among, galen, s, major, contributions, to, medicine, was, his, work, on, the, circulatory, system, he, was, the, first, to, recognize, that, there, are, distinct, differences, between, venous, dark, and, arterial, bright, blood, in, addition, to, these, discoveries, galen, postulated, much, more, about, the, nature, of, the, circulatory, system, he, believed, that, blood, originated, in, the, liver, which, follows, the, teachings, of, hippocrates, the, liver, converted, nutrients, gathered, from, ingested, food, into, blood, to, be, used, in, the, circulatory, system, the, blood, created, in, the, liver, would, eventually, flow, unidirectionally, into, the, right, ventricle, of, the, heart, via, the, great, vein, galen, also, proposed, a, theory, on, how, blood, receives, air, from, the, lungs, to, be, distributed, throughout, the, body, he, declared, that, the, venous, artery, carried, air, from, the, lungs, into, the, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, to, mix, with, created, blood, from, the, liver, this, same, venous, artery, allowed, for, an, exchange, of, waste, products, from, the, blood, back, into, the, lungs, to, be, exhaled, in, order, to, receive, air, from, the, lungs, in, the, left, ventricle, the, new, blood, needed, to, get, there, from, the, right, ventricle, thus, galen, asserted, that, there, are, small, holes, in, the, septum, dividing, the, left, and, right, sides, of, the, heart, these, holes, allowed, the, blood, to, pass, through, easily, to, receive, air, and, exchange, the, aforementioned, waste, products, although, his, anatomical, experiments, on, animal, models, led, him, to, a, more, complete, understanding, of, the, circulatory, system, nervous, system, respiratory, system, and, other, structures, his, work, contained, scientific, errors, galen, believed, the, circulatory, system, to, consist, of, two, separate, one, way, systems, of, distribution, rather, than, a, single, unified, system, of, circulation, he, believed, venous, blood, to, be, generated, in, the, liver, from, where, it, was, distributed, and, consumed, by, all, organs, of, the, body, he, posited, that, arterial, blood, originated, in, the, heart, from, where, it, was, distributed, and, consumed, by, all, organs, of, the, body, the, blood, was, then, regenerated, in, either, the, liver, or, the, heart, completing, the, cycle, galen, also, believed, in, the, existence, of, a, group, of, blood, vessels, he, called, the, rete, mirabile, in, the, carotid, sinus, both, of, these, theories, of, the, circulation, of, blood, were, later, beginning, with, works, of, ibn, al, nafis, published, c, 1242, shown, to, be, incorrect, galen, was, also, a, pioneer, in, research, about, the, human, spine, his, dissections, and, vivisections, of, animals, led, to, key, observations, that, helped, him, accurately, describe, the, human, spine, spinal, cord, and, vertebral, column, galen, also, played, a, major, role, in, the, discoveries, of, the, central, nervous, system, he, was, also, able, to, describe, the, nerves, that, emerge, from, the, spine, which, is, integral, to, his, research, about, the, nervous, system, galen, went, on, to, be, the, first, physician, to, study, what, happens, when, the, spinal, cord, is, transected, on, multiple, different, levels, he, worked, with, pigs, and, studied, their, neuroanatomy, by, severing, different, nerves, either, totally, or, partially, to, see, how, it, affected, the, body, he, even, dealt, with, diseases, affecting, the, spinal, cord, and, nerves, in, his, work, de, motu, musculorum, galen, explained, the, difference, between, motor, and, sensory, nerves, discussed, the, concept, of, muscle, tone, and, explained, the, difference, between, agonists, and, antagonists, galen, s, work, on, animals, led, to, some, inaccuracies, most, notably, his, anatomy, of, the, uterus, which, largely, resembled, a, dog, s, though, incorrect, in, his, studies, of, human, reproduction, and, reproductive, anatomy, he, came, very, close, to, identifying, the, ovaries, as, analogous, to, the, male, testes, reproduction, was, a, controversial, topic, in, galen, s, lifetime, as, there, was, much, debate, over, if, the, male, was, solely, responsible, for, the, seed, or, if, the, woman, was, also, responsible, through, his, vivisection, practices, galen, also, proved, that, the, voice, was, controlled, by, the, brain, one, of, the, most, famous, experiments, that, he, recreated, in, public, was, the, squealing, pig, galen, would, cut, open, a, pig, and, while, it, was, squealing, he, would, tie, off, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, or, vocal, cords, showing, they, controlled, the, making, of, sound, he, used, the, same, method, to, tie, off, the, ureters, to, prove, his, theories, of, kidney, and, bladder, function, galen, believed, the, human, body, had, three, interconnected, systems, that, allowed, it, to, work, the, first, system, that, he, theorized, consisted, of, the, brain, and, the, nerves, responsible, for, thought, and, sensation, the, second, theorized, system, was, the, heart, and, the, arteries, which, galen, believed, to, be, responsible, for, providing, life, giving, energy, the, last, theorized, system, was, the, liver, and, veins, which, galen, theorized, were, responsible, for, nutrition, and, growth, galen, also, theorized, that, blood, was, made, in, the, liver, and, sent, out, around, the, body, one, of, galen, s, major, works, on, the, doctrines, of, hippocrates, and, plato, sought, to, demonstrate, the, unity, of, the, two, subjects, and, their, views, using, their, theories, combined, with, aristotle, s, galen, developed, a, tripartite, soul, consisting, of, similar, aspects, he, used, the, same, terms, as, plato, referring, to, the, three, parts, as, rational, spiritual, and, appetitive, each, corresponded, to, a, localized, area, of, the, body, the, rational, soul, was, in, the, brain, the, spiritual, soul, was, in, the, heart, and, the, appetitive, soul, was, in, the, liver, galen, was, the, first, scientist, and, philosopher, to, assign, specific, parts, of, the, soul, to, locations, in, the, body, because, of, his, extensive, background, in, medicine, this, idea, is, now, referred, to, as, localization, of, function, galen, s, assignments, were, revolutionary, for, the, time, period, which, set, the, precedent, for, future, localization, theories, galen, believed, each, part, of, this, tripartite, soul, controlled, specific, functions, within, the, body, and, that, the, soul, as, a, whole, contributed, to, the, health, of, the, body, strengthening, the, natural, functioning, capacity, of, the, organ, or, organs, in, question, the, rational, soul, controlled, higher, level, cognitive, functioning, in, an, organism, for, example, making, choices, or, perceiving, the, world, and, sending, those, signals, to, the, brain, he, also, listed, imagination, memory, recollection, knowledge, thought, consideration, voluntary, motion, and, sensation, as, being, found, within, the, rational, soul, the, functions, of, growing, or, being, alive, resided, in, the, spirited, soul, the, spirited, soul, also, contained, our, passions, such, as, anger, these, passions, were, considered, to, be, even, stronger, than, regular, emotions, and, as, a, consequence, more, dangerous, the, third, part, of, the, soul, or, the, appetitive, spirit, controlled, the, living, forces, in, our, body, most, importantly, blood, the, appetitive, spirit, also, regulated, the, pleasures, of, the, body, and, was, moved, by, feelings, of, enjoyment, this, third, part, of, the, soul, is, the, animalistic, or, more, natural, side, of, the, soul, it, deals, with, the, natural, urges, of, the, body, and, survival, instincts, galen, proposed, that, when, the, soul, is, moved, by, too, much, enjoyment, it, reaches, states, of, incontinence, and, licentiousness, the, inability, to, willfully, cease, enjoyment, which, was, a, negative, consequence, of, too, much, pleasure, in, order, to, unite, his, theories, about, the, soul, and, how, it, operated, within, the, body, he, adapted, the, theory, of, the, pneuma, which, he, used, to, explain, how, the, soul, operated, within, its, assigned, organs, and, how, those, organs, in, turn, interacted, together, galen, then, distinguished, the, vital, pneuma, in, the, arterial, system, from, the, psychic, pneuma, in, the, brain, and, nervous, system, galen, placed, the, vital, pneuma, in, the, heart, and, the, psychic, pneuma, spiritus, animalis, within, the, brain, he, conducted, many, anatomical, studies, on, animals, most, famously, an, ox, to, study, the, transition, from, vital, to, psychic, pneuma, although, highly, criticized, for, comparing, animal, anatomy, to, human, anatomy, galen, was, convinced, that, his, knowledge, was, abundant, enough, in, both, anatomies, to, base, one, on, the, other, in, his, treatise, on, the, usefulness, of, the, parts, of, the, body, galen, argued, that, the, perfect, suitability, of, each, part, of, the, body, to, its, function, indicated, the, role, of, an, intelligent, creator, his, creationism, was, anticipated, by, the, anatomical, examples, of, socrates, and, empedocles, although, the, main, focus, of, his, work, was, on, medicine, anatomy, and, physiology, galen, also, wrote, about, logic, and, philosophy, his, writings, were, influenced, by, earlier, greek, and, roman, thinkers, including, plato, aristotle, the, stoics, and, the, pyrrhonists, galen, was, concerned, to, combine, philosophical, thought, with, medical, practice, as, in, his, brief, work, that, the, best, physician, is, also, a, philosopher, he, took, aspects, from, each, group, and, combined, them, with, his, original, thought, he, regarded, medicine, as, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, was, best, practiced, by, utilizing, theory, observation, and, experimentation, in, conjunction, galen, combined, his, observations, of, his, dissections, with, plato, s, theory, about, the, soul, plato, believed, that, the, body, and, the, soul, were, separate, entities, rivaling, the, stoics, plato, proclaimed, that, the, soul, is, immortal, so, it, must, exist, before, one, is, born, beyond, the, human, body, this, influenced, galen, s, thinking, that, the, soul, had, to, be, acquired, because, the, soul, does, not, always, reside, within, the, human, body, plato, s, influence, in, galen, s, model, showed, itself, most, prominently, in, what, galen, dubbed, arterial, blood, which, is, a, mixture, of, nutritious, blood, from, the, liver, and, the, vital, spirit, the, soul, which, was, attained, from, the, lungs, the, vital, spirit, within, this, medium, was, necessary, for, the, body, to, function, and, eventually, completely, absorbed, this, process, was, then, repeated, indefinitely, according, to, galen, so, that, the, body, could, be, replenished, with, the, soul, or, the, vital, spirit, several, schools, of, thought, existed, within, the, medical, field, during, galen, s, lifetime, the, main, two, being, the, empiricists, and, rationalists, also, called, dogmatists, or, philosophers, with, the, methodists, being, a, smaller, group, the, empiricists, emphasized, the, importance, of, physical, practice, and, experimentation, or, active, learning, in, the, medical, discipline, in, direct, opposition, to, the, empiricists, were, the, rationalists, who, valued, the, study, of, established, teachings, in, order, to, create, new, theories, in, the, name, of, medical, advancements, the, methodists, formed, somewhat, of, a, middle, ground, as, they, were, not, as, experimental, as, the, empiricists, nor, as, theoretical, as, the, rationalists, the, methodists, mainly, utilized, pure, observation, showing, greater, interest, in, studying, the, natural, course, of, ailments, than, making, efforts, to, find, remedies, galen, s, education, had, exposed, him, to, the, five, major, schools, of, thought, platonists, peripatetics, stoics, epicureans, pyrrhonists, with, teachers, from, the, rationalist, sect, and, from, the, empiricist, sect, galen, was, well, known, for, his, advancements, in, medicine, and, the, circulatory, system, but, he, was, also, concerned, with, philosophy, he, developed, his, own, tripartite, soul, model, following, the, examples, of, plato, some, scholars, refer, to, him, as, a, platonist, galen, developed, a, theory, of, personality, based, on, his, understanding, of, fluid, circulation, in, humans, and, he, believed, that, there, was, a, physiological, basis, for, mental, disorders, galen, connected, many, of, his, theories, to, the, pneuma, and, he, opposed, the, stoics, definition, of, and, use, of, the, pneuma, the, stoics, according, to, galen, failed, to, give, a, credible, answer, for, the, localization, of, functions, of, the, psyche, or, the, mind, through, his, use, of, medicine, he, was, convinced, that, he, came, up, with, a, better, answer, the, brain, the, stoics, only, recognized, the, soul, as, having, one, part, which, was, the, rational, soul, and, they, claimed, it, would, be, found, in, the, heart, galen, following, plato, s, idea, came, up, with, two, more, parts, to, the, soul, galen, also, rejected, stoic, propositional, logic, and, instead, embraced, a, hypothetical, syllogistic, which, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, peripatetics, and, based, on, elements, of, aristotelian, logic, galen, believed, there, is, no, sharp, distinction, between, the, mental, and, the, physical, this, was, a, controversial, argument, at, the, time, and, galen, agreed, with, some, greek, philosophical, schools, in, believing, that, the, mind, and, body, were, not, separate, faculties, he, believed, that, this, could, be, scientifically, shown, this, was, where, his, opposition, to, the, stoics, became, most, prevalent, galen, proposed, organs, within, the, body, to, be, responsible, for, specific, functions, according, to, galen, the, stoics, lack, of, scientific, justification, discredited, their, claims, of, the, separateness, of, mind, and, body, which, is, why, he, spoke, so, strongly, against, them, there, is, an, intense, scholarly, debate, about, soul, body, relations, in, galen, s, psychological, writings, in, his, brief, treatise, quod, animi, mores, galen, says, both, that, the, soul, follows, the, mixtures, of, the, body, and, that, the, soul, is, a, bodily, mixture, scholars, have, offered, ways, of, reconciling, these, claims, arguing, for, a, materialist, reading, of, galen, s, philosophy, of, mind, according, to, this, materialist, reading, galen, identifies, the, soul, with, the, mixtures, of, the, body, another, one, of, galen, s, major, works, on, the, diagnosis, and, cure, of, the, soul, s, passion, discussed, how, to, approach, and, treat, psychological, problems, this, was, galen, s, early, attempt, at, what, would, later, be, called, psychotherapy, his, book, contained, directions, on, how, to, provide, counsel, to, those, with, psychological, issues, to, prompt, them, to, reveal, their, deepest, passions, and, secrets, and, eventually, cure, them, of, their, mental, deficiency, the, leading, individual, or, therapist, had, to, be, a, male, preferably, of, an, older, wiser, age, as, well, as, free, from, the, control, of, the, passions, these, passions, according, to, galen, caused, the, psychological, problems, that, people, experienced, galen, may, have, produced, more, work, than, any, author, in, antiquity, rivaling, the, quantity, of, work, issued, from, augustine, of, hippo, so, profuse, was, galen, s, output, that, the, surviving, texts, represent, nearly, half, of, all, the, extant, literature, from, ancient, greece, it, has, been, reported, that, galen, employed, twenty, scribes, to, write, down, his, words, galen, may, have, written, as, many, as, 500, treatises, amounting, to, some, 10, million, words, although, his, surviving, works, amount, to, some, 3, million, words, this, is, thought, to, represent, less, than, a, third, of, his, complete, writings, in, 191, or, more, likely, in, 192, a, fire, in, the, temple, of, peace, destroyed, many, of, his, works, in, particular, treatises, on, philosophy, because, galen, s, works, were, not, translated, into, latin, in, the, ancient, period, and, because, of, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, west, the, study, of, galen, along, with, the, greek, medical, tradition, as, a, whole, went, into, decline, in, western, europe, during, the, early, middle, ages, when, very, few, latin, scholars, could, read, greek, however, in, general, galen, and, the, ancient, greek, medical, tradition, continued, to, be, studied, and, followed, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, commonly, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, all, of, the, extant, greek, manuscripts, of, galen, were, copied, by, byzantine, scholars, in, the, abbasid, period, after, 750, arab, muslims, began, to, be, interested, in, greek, scientific, and, medical, texts, for, the, first, time, and, had, some, of, galen, s, texts, translated, into, arabic, often, by, syrian, christian, scholars, see, below, as, a, result, some, texts, of, galen, exist, only, in, arabic, translation, while, others, exist, only, in, medieval, latin, translations, of, the, arabic, in, some, cases, scholars, have, even, attempted, to, translate, from, the, latin, or, arabic, back, into, greek, where, the, original, is, lost, for, some, of, the, ancient, sources, such, as, herophilus, galen, s, account, of, their, work, is, all, that, survives, even, in, his, own, time, forgeries, and, unscrupulous, editions, of, his, work, were, a, problem, prompting, him, to, write, on, his, own, books, forgeries, in, latin, arabic, or, greek, continued, until, the, renaissance, some, of, galen, s, treatises, have, appeared, under, many, different, titles, over, the, years, sources, are, often, in, obscure, and, difficult, to, access, journals, or, repositories, although, written, in, greek, by, convention, the, works, are, referred, to, by, latin, titles, and, often, by, merely, abbreviations, of, those, no, single, authoritative, collection, of, his, work, exists, and, controversy, remains, as, to, the, authenticity, of, a, number, of, works, attributed, to, galen, as, a, consequence, research, on, galen, s, work, is, fraught, with, hazard, various, attempts, have, been, made, to, classify, galen, s, vast, output, for, instance, coxe, 1846, lists, a, prolegomena, or, introductory, books, followed, by, 7, classes, of, treatise, embracing, physiology, 28, vols, hygiene, 12, aetiology, 19, semeiotics, 14, pharmacy, 10, blood, letting, 4, and, therapeutics, 17, in, addition, to, 4, of, aphorisms, and, spurious, works, the, most, complete, compendium, of, galen, s, writings, surpassing, even, modern, projects, like, the, corpus, medicorum, graecorum, latinorum, is, the, one, compiled, and, translated, by, karl, gottlob, k, hn, of, leipzig, between, 1821, and, 1833, this, collection, consists, of, 122, of, galen, s, treatises, translated, from, the, original, greek, into, latin, the, text, is, presented, in, both, languages, over, 20, 000, pages, in, length, it, is, divided, into, 22, volumes, with, 676, index, pages, many, of, galen, s, works, are, included, in, the, thesaurus, linguae, graecae, a, digital, library, of, greek, literature, started, in, 1972, another, useful, modern, source, is, the, french, biblioth, que, interuniversitaire, de, m, decine, archived, 2014, 04, 21, at, the, wayback, machine, bium, in, his, time, galen, s, reputation, as, both, physician, and, philosopher, was, legendary, the, emperor, marcus, aurelius, describing, him, as, primum, sane, medicorum, esse, philosophorum, autem, solum, first, among, doctors, and, unique, among, philosophers, praen, 14, 660, other, contemporary, authors, in, the, greek, world, confirm, this, including, theodotus, the, shoemaker, athenaeus, and, alexander, of, aphrodisias, the, 7th, century, poet, george, of, pisida, went, so, far, as, to, refer, to, christ, as, a, second, and, neglected, galen, galen, continued, to, exert, an, important, influence, over, the, theory, and, practice, of, medicine, until, the, mid, 17th, century, in, the, byzantine, and, arabic, worlds, and, europe, a, few, centuries, after, galen, palladius, iatrosophista, stated, in, his, commentary, on, hippocrates, that, hippocrates, sowed, and, galen, reaped, galen, summarized, and, synthesized, the, work, of, his, predecessors, and, it, is, in, galen, s, words, galenism, that, greek, medicine, was, handed, down, to, subsequent, generations, such, that, galenism, became, the, means, by, which, greek, medicine, was, known, to, the, world, often, this, was, in, the, form, of, restating, and, reinterpreting, such, as, in, magnus, of, nisibis, 4th, century, work, on, urine, which, was, in, turn, translated, into, arabic, yet, the, full, importance, of, his, contributions, was, not, appreciated, until, long, after, his, death, galen, s, rhetoric, and, prolificity, were, so, powerful, as, to, convey, the, impression, that, there, was, little, left, to, learn, the, term, galenism, has, subsequently, taken, on, both, a, positive, and, pejorative, meaning, as, one, that, transformed, medicine, in, late, antiquity, yet, so, dominated, subsequent, thinking, as, to, stifle, further, progress, after, the, collapse, of, the, western, empire, the, study, of, galen, and, other, greek, works, almost, disappeared, in, the, latin, west, in, contrast, in, the, predominantly, greek, speaking, eastern, half, of, the, roman, empire, byzantium, many, commentators, of, the, subsequent, centuries, such, as, oribasius, physician, to, the, emperor, julian, who, compiled, a, synopsis, in, the, 4th, century, preserved, and, disseminated, galen, s, works, making, them, more, accessible, nutton, refers, to, these, authors, as, the, medical, refrigerators, of, antiquity, in, late, antiquity, medical, writing, veered, increasingly, in, the, direction, of, the, theoretical, at, the, expense, of, the, practical, with, many, authors, merely, debating, galenism, magnus, of, nisibis, was, a, pure, theorist, as, were, john, of, alexandria, and, agnellus, of, ravenna, with, their, lectures, on, galen, s, de, sectis, so, strong, was, galenism, that, other, authors, such, as, hippocrates, began, to, be, seen, through, galen, s, eyes, while, his, opponents, became, marginalised, and, other, medical, sects, such, as, asclepiadism, slowly, disappeared, greek, medicine, was, part, of, greek, culture, and, syrian, christians, came, in, contact, with, it, while, the, eastern, roman, empire, byzantium, ruled, syria, and, western, mesopotamia, regions, that, were, conquered, in, the, 7th, century, by, the, arabs, after, 750, these, syrian, christians, made, the, first, translations, of, galen, into, syriac, and, arabic, from, then, on, galen, and, the, greek, medical, tradition, in, general, became, assimilated, into, the, medieval, and, early, modern, islamic, middle, east, job, of, edessa, is, said, to, have, translated, 36, of, galen, s, works, into, syriac, some, of, which, were, later, translated, into, arabic, by, hunain, ibn, ishaq, galen, s, approach, to, medicine, became, and, remains, influential, in, the, islamic, world, the, first, major, translator, of, galen, into, arabic, was, the, arab, christian, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, he, translated, c, 830, 870, 129, works, of, jalinos, into, arabic, arabic, sources, such, as, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, al, r, zi, ad, 865, 925, continue, to, be, the, source, of, discovery, of, new, or, relatively, inaccessible, galenic, writings, one, of, hunayn, s, arabic, translations, kitab, ila, aglooqan, fi, shifa, al, amrad, which, is, extant, in, the, library, of, ibn, sina, academy, of, medieval, medicine, sciences, is, regarded, as, a, masterpiece, of, galen, s, literary, works, a, part, of, the, alexandrian, compendium, of, galen, s, work, this, 10th, century, manuscript, comprises, two, parts, that, include, details, regarding, various, types, of, fevers, humyat, and, different, inflammatory, conditions, of, the, body, more, important, is, that, it, includes, details, of, more, than, 150, single, and, compound, formulations, of, both, herbal, and, animal, origin, the, book, provides, an, insight, into, understanding, the, traditions, and, methods, of, treatment, in, the, greek, and, roman, eras, in, addition, this, book, provides, a, direct, source, for, the, study, of, more, than, 150, single, and, compound, drugs, used, during, the, greco, roman, period, as, the, title, of, doubts, on, galen, by, al, r, zi, implies, as, well, as, the, writings, of, physicians, such, as, ibn, zuhr, and, ibn, al, nafis, the, works, of, galen, were, not, accepted, unquestioningly, but, as, a, challengeable, basis, for, further, inquiry, a, strong, emphasis, on, experimentation, and, empiricism, led, to, new, results, and, new, observations, which, were, contrasted, and, combined, with, those, of, galen, by, writers, such, as, al, r, zi, ali, ibn, abbas, al, majusi, abu, al, qasim, al, zahrawi, ibn, sina, avicenna, ibn, zuhr, and, ibn, al, nafis, for, example, ibn, al, nafis, discovery, of, the, pulmonary, circulation, contradicted, the, galenic, theory, on, the, heart, the, influence, of, galen, s, writings, including, humorism, remains, strong, in, modern, unani, medicine, now, closely, identified, with, islamic, culture, and, widely, practiced, from, india, where, it, is, officially, recognized, to, morocco, maimonides, was, influenced, by, galen, whom, he, cited, most, often, in, his, medical, works, and, whom, he, considered, to, be, the, greatest, physician, of, all, time, in, india, many, hindu, physicians, studied, persian, and, urdu, languages, and, learnt, galenic, medicine, this, trend, of, studies, among, hindu, physicians, began, in, the, 17th, century, and, lasted, until, the, early, 20th, century, speziale, 2018, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, latin, translations, of, islamic, medical, texts, began, to, appear, in, the, west, alongside, the, salerno, school, of, thought, and, were, soon, incorporated, into, the, curriculum, at, the, universities, of, naples, and, montpellier, from, that, time, galenism, took, on, a, new, unquestioned, authority, galen, even, being, referred, to, as, the, medical, pope, of, the, middle, ages, constantine, the, african, was, amongst, those, who, translated, both, hippocrates, and, galen, from, arabic, in, addition, to, the, more, numerous, translations, of, arabic, texts, in, this, period, there, were, a, few, translations, of, galenic, works, directly, from, the, greek, such, as, burgundio, of, pisa, s, translation, of, de, complexionibus, galen, s, works, on, anatomy, and, medicine, became, the, mainstay, of, the, medieval, physician, s, university, curriculum, alongside, ibn, sina, s, the, canon, of, medicine, which, elaborated, on, galen, s, works, unlike, pagan, rome, christian, europe, did, not, exercise, a, universal, prohibition, of, the, dissection, and, autopsy, of, the, human, body, and, such, examinations, were, carried, out, regularly, from, at, least, the, 13th, century, however, galen, s, influence, was, so, great, that, when, dissections, discovered, anomalies, compared, with, galen, s, anatomy, the, physicians, often, tried, to, fit, these, into, the, galenic, system, an, example, of, this, is, mondino, de, liuzzi, who, describes, rudimentary, blood, circulation, in, his, writings, but, still, asserts, that, the, left, ventricle, should, contain, air, some, cited, these, changes, as, proof, that, human, anatomy, had, changed, since, the, time, of, galen, the, most, important, translator, of, galen, s, works, into, latin, was, niccol, di, deoprepio, da, reggio, who, spent, several, years, working, on, galen, niccol, worked, at, the, angevin, court, during, the, reign, of, king, robert, of, naples, among, niccol, s, translations, is, a, piece, from, a, medical, treatise, by, galen, of, which, the, original, text, is, lost, the, first, edition, of, galen, s, complete, works, in, latin, translation, was, edited, by, diomede, bonardo, of, brescia, and, printed, at, venice, by, filippo, pinzi, in, 1490, the, renaissance, and, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, 1453, were, accompanied, by, an, influx, of, greek, scholars, and, manuscripts, to, the, west, allowing, direct, comparison, between, the, arabic, commentaries, and, the, original, greek, texts, of, galen, this, new, learning, and, the, humanist, movement, particularly, the, work, of, linacre, promoted, literae, humaniores, including, galen, in, the, latin, scientific, canon, de, naturalibus, facultatibus, appearing, in, london, in, 1523, debates, on, medical, science, now, had, two, traditions, the, more, conservative, arabian, and, the, liberal, greek, the, more, extreme, liberal, movements, began, to, challenge, the, role, of, authority, in, medicine, as, exemplified, by, paracelsus, symbolically, burning, the, works, of, avicenna, and, galen, at, his, medical, school, in, basle, nevertheless, galen, s, pre, eminence, amongst, the, great, thinkers, of, the, millennium, is, exemplified, by, a, 16th, century, mural, in, the, refectory, of, the, great, lavra, of, mt, athos, it, depicts, pagan, sages, at, the, foot, of, the, tree, of, jesse, with, galen, between, the, sibyl, and, aristotle, galenism, s, final, defeat, came, from, a, combination, of, the, negativism, of, paracelsus, and, the, constructivism, of, the, italian, renaissance, anatomists, such, as, vesalius, in, the, 16th, century, in, the, 1530s, the, flemish, anatomist, and, physician, andreas, vesalius, took, on, a, project, to, translate, many, of, galen, s, greek, texts, into, latin, vesalius, most, famous, work, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, was, greatly, influenced, by, galenic, writing, and, form, seeking, to, examine, critically, galen, s, methods, and, outlook, vesalius, turned, to, human, cadaver, dissection, as, a, means, of, verification, galen, s, writings, were, shown, by, vesalius, to, describe, details, present, in, monkeys, but, not, in, humans, and, he, demonstrated, galen, s, limitations, through, books, and, hands, on, demonstrations, despite, fierce, opposition, from, orthodox, pro, galenists, such, as, jacobus, sylvius, since, galen, states, that, he, is, using, observations, of, monkeys, human, dissection, was, prohibited, to, give, an, account, of, what, the, body, looks, like, vesalius, could, portray, himself, as, using, galen, s, approach, of, description, of, direct, observation, to, create, a, record, of, the, exact, details, of, the, human, body, since, he, worked, in, a, time, when, human, dissection, was, allowed, galen, argued, that, monkey, anatomy, was, close, enough, to, humans, for, physicians, to, learn, anatomy, with, monkey, dissections, and, then, make, observations, of, similar, structures, in, the, wounds, of, their, patients, rather, than, trying, to, learn, anatomy, only, from, wounds, in, human, patients, as, would, be, done, by, students, trained, in, the, empiricist, model, the, examinations, of, vesalius, also, disproved, medical, theories, of, aristotle, and, mondino, de, liuzzi, one, of, the, best, known, examples, of, vesalius, overturning, of, galenism, was, his, demonstration, that, the, interventricular, septum, of, the, heart, was, not, permeable, as, galen, had, taught, nat, fac, iii, xv, however, this, had, been, revealed, two, years, before, by, michael, servetus, in, his, fateful, christianismi, restitutio, 1553, with, only, three, copies, of, the, book, surviving, but, these, remained, hidden, for, decades, the, rest, were, burned, shortly, after, its, publication, because, of, persecution, of, servetus, by, religious, authorities, michael, servetus, using, the, name, michel, de, villeneuve, during, his, stay, in, france, was, vesalius, fellow, student, and, the, best, galenist, at, the, university, of, paris,
