until, his, death, in, 1715, his, verified, reign, of, 72, years, and, 110, days, is, the, longest, of, any, sovereign, an, emblematic, character, of, the, age, of, absolutism, in, europe, louis, xiv, s, legacy, is, widely, characterized, by, french, colonial, expansion, the, conclusion, of, eighty, years, war, involving, the, hapsburgs, and, his, architectural, bequest, marked, by, commissioned, works, of, art, and, buildings, his, pageantry, opulent, lifestyle, and, ornate, cultivated, image, earned, him, enduring, admiration, louis, xiv, raised, france, to, be, the, exemplar, nation, state, of, the, early, modern, period, and, established, a, cultural, prestige, which, lasted, through, the, subsequent, centuries, until, today, louis, began, his, personal, rule, of, france, in, 1661, after, the, death, of, his, chief, minister, cardinal, mazarin, when, the, king, famously, declared, that, he, would, take, over, the, job, himself, an, adherent, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, louis, continued, his, predecessors, work, of, creating, a, centralised, state, governed, from, the, capital, he, sought, to, eliminate, the, remnants, of, feudalism, persisting, in, parts, of, france, by, compelling, many, members, of, the, nobility, to, reside, at, his, lavish, palace, of, versailles, he, succeeded, in, pacifying, the, aristocracy, many, of, whom, had, participated, in, the, fronde, rebellions, during, his, minority, he, thus, became, one, of, the, most, powerful, french, monarchs, and, consolidated, a, system, of, absolute, monarchy, in, france, that, endured, until, the, french, revolution, louis, also, enforced, uniformity, of, religion, under, the, catholic, church, his, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, abolished, the, rights, of, the, huguenot, protestant, minority, and, subjected, them, to, a, wave, of, dragonnades, effectively, forcing, huguenots, to, emigrate, or, convert, virtually, destroying, the, french, protestant, community, during, louis, s, long, reign, france, emerged, as, the, leading, european, power, and, regularly, made, war, a, conflict, with, spain, marked, his, entire, childhood, while, during, his, personal, rule, louis, fought, three, major, continental, conflicts, each, against, powerful, foreign, alliances, the, franco, dutch, war, the, nine, years, war, and, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, addition, france, contested, shorter, wars, such, as, the, war, of, devolution, and, the, war, of, the, reunions, warfare, defined, louis, s, foreign, policy, impelled, by, his, personal, ambition, for, glory, and, power, a, mix, of, commerce, revenge, and, pique, his, wars, strained, france, s, resources, to, the, utmost, while, in, peacetime, he, concentrated, on, preparing, for, the, next, war, he, taught, his, diplomats, that, their, job, was, to, create, tactical, and, strategic, advantages, for, the, french, military, upon, his, death, in, 1715, louis, xiv, left, his, great, grandson, and, successor, louis, xv, a, powerful, but, war, weary, kingdom, in, major, debt, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, that, had, raged, on, since, 1701, some, of, his, other, notable, achievements, include, the, construction, of, the, canal, du, midi, the, patronage, of, artists, and, the, founding, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, louis, xiv, was, born, on, 5, september, 1638, in, the, ch, teau, de, saint, germain, en, laye, to, louis, xiii, and, anne, of, austria, he, was, named, louis, dieudonn, louis, the, god, given, and, bore, the, traditional, title, of, french, heirs, apparent, dauphin, at, the, time, of, his, birth, his, parents, had, been, married, for, 23, years, his, mother, had, experienced, four, stillbirths, between, 1619, and, 1631, leading, contemporaries, thus, regarded, him, as, a, divine, gift, and, his, birth, a, miracle, of, god, louis, s, relationship, with, his, mother, was, uncommonly, affectionate, for, the, time, contemporaries, and, eyewitnesses, claimed, that, the, queen, would, spend, all, her, time, with, louis, both, were, greatly, interested, in, food, and, theatre, and, it, is, highly, likely, that, louis, developed, these, interests, through, his, close, relationship, with, his, mother, this, long, lasting, and, loving, relationship, can, be, evidenced, by, excerpts, in, louis, s, journal, entries, such, as, nature, was, responsible, for, the, first, knots, which, tied, me, to, my, mother, but, attachments, formed, later, by, shared, qualities, of, the, spirit, are, far, more, difficult, to, break, than, those, formed, merely, by, blood, it, was, his, mother, who, gave, louis, his, belief, in, the, absolute, and, divine, power, of, his, monarchical, rule, during, his, childhood, he, was, taken, care, of, by, the, governesses, fran, oise, de, lansac, and, marie, catherine, de, senecey, in, 1646, nicolas, v, de, villeroy, became, the, young, king, s, tutor, louis, xiv, became, friends, with, villeroy, s, young, children, particularly, fran, ois, de, villeroy, and, divided, his, time, between, the, palais, royal, and, the, nearby, hotel, de, villeroy, sensing, imminent, death, in, the, spring, of, 1643, king, louis, xiii, decided, to, put, his, affairs, in, order, for, his, four, year, old, son, louis, xiv, not, trusting, the, judgement, of, his, spanish, wife, queen, anne, who, would, normally, have, become, the, sole, regent, of, france, the, king, decreed, that, a, regency, council, would, rule, on, his, son, s, behalf, with, anne, at, its, head, louis, xiii, died, on, 14, may, 1643, on, 18, may, queen, anne, had, her, husband, s, will, annulled, by, the, parlement, de, paris, a, judicial, body, of, nobles, and, high, clergymen, and, she, became, sole, regent, she, exiled, her, husband, s, ministers, chavigny, and, bouthilier, and, appointed, the, count, of, brienne, as, her, minister, of, foreign, affairs, anne, kept, the, direction, of, religious, policy, strongly, in, hand, until, her, son, s, majority, in, 1661, she, appointed, cardinal, mazarin, as, chief, minister, giving, him, the, daily, administration, of, policy, she, continued, the, policies, of, her, late, husband, and, cardinal, richelieu, despite, their, persecution, of, her, in, order, to, win, absolute, authority, in, france, and, victory, abroad, for, her, son, anne, protected, mazarin, by, exiling, her, followers, the, duke, of, beaufort, and, marie, de, rohan, who, conspired, against, him, in, 1643, the, best, example, of, anne, s, loyalty, to, france, was, her, treatment, of, one, of, richelieu, s, men, the, chancellor, pierre, s, guier, s, guier, had, brusquely, interrogated, anne, in, 1637, like, a, common, criminal, as, she, recalled, following, the, discovery, that, she, was, giving, military, secrets, to, her, father, in, spain, and, anne, was, virtually, under, house, arrest, for, years, by, keeping, the, effective, s, guier, in, his, post, anne, sacrificed, her, own, feelings, for, the, interests, of, france, and, her, son, louis, the, queen, sought, a, lasting, peace, between, catholic, nations, but, only, after, a, french, victory, over, her, native, spain, she, also, gave, a, partial, catholic, orientation, to, french, foreign, policy, this, was, felt, by, the, netherlands, france, s, protestant, ally, which, negotiated, a, separate, peace, with, spain, in, 1648, in, 1648, anne, and, mazarin, successfully, negotiated, the, peace, of, westphalia, which, ended, the, thirty, years, war, its, terms, ensured, dutch, independence, from, spain, awarded, some, autonomy, to, the, various, german, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, granted, sweden, seats, on, the, imperial, diet, and, territories, controlling, the, mouths, of, the, oder, elbe, and, weser, rivers, france, however, profited, most, from, the, settlement, austria, ruled, by, the, habsburg, emperor, ferdinand, iii, ceded, all, habsburg, lands, and, claims, in, alsace, to, france, and, acknowledged, her, de, facto, sovereignty, over, the, three, bishoprics, of, metz, verdun, and, toul, moreover, many, petty, german, states, sought, french, protection, eager, to, emancipate, themselves, from, habsburg, domination, this, anticipated, the, formation, of, the, 1658, league, of, the, rhine, which, further, diminished, imperial, power, as, the, thirty, years, war, came, to, an, end, a, civil, war, known, as, the, fronde, erupted, in, france, it, effectively, checked, france, s, ability, to, exploit, the, peace, of, westphalia, anne, and, mazarin, had, largely, pursued, the, policies, of, cardinal, richelieu, augmenting, the, crown, s, power, at, the, expense, of, the, nobility, and, the, parlements, anne, was, more, concerned, with, internal, policy, than, foreign, affairs, she, was, a, very, proud, queen, who, insisted, on, the, divine, rights, of, the, king, of, france, all, this, led, her, to, advocate, a, forceful, policy, in, all, matters, relating, to, the, king, s, authority, in, a, manner, that, was, much, more, radical, than, the, one, proposed, by, mazarin, the, cardinal, depended, totally, on, anne, s, support, and, had, to, use, all, his, influence, on, the, queen, to, temper, some, of, her, radical, actions, anne, imprisoned, any, aristocrat, or, member, of, parliament, who, challenged, her, will, her, main, aim, was, to, transfer, to, her, son, an, absolute, authority, in, the, matters, of, finance, and, justice, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, parlement, of, paris, whom, she, had, jailed, died, in, prison, the, frondeurs, political, heirs, of, the, disaffected, feudal, aristocracy, sought, to, protect, their, traditional, feudal, privileges, from, the, increasingly, centralized, royal, government, furthermore, they, believed, their, traditional, influence, and, authority, was, being, usurped, by, the, recently, ennobled, bureaucrats, the, noblesse, de, robe, or, nobility, of, the, robe, who, administered, the, kingdom, and, on, whom, the, monarchy, increasingly, began, to, rely, this, belief, intensified, the, nobles, resentment, in, 1648, anne, and, mazarin, attempted, to, tax, members, of, the, parlement, de, paris, the, members, refused, to, comply, and, ordered, all, of, the, king, s, earlier, financial, edicts, burned, buoyed, by, the, victory, of, louis, duc, d, enghien, later, known, as, le, grand, cond, at, the, battle, of, lens, mazarin, on, queen, anne, s, insistence, arrested, certain, members, in, a, show, of, force, the, most, important, arrest, from, anne, s, point, of, view, concerned, pierre, broussel, one, of, the, most, important, leaders, in, the, parlement, de, paris, people, in, france, were, complaining, about, the, expansion, of, royal, authority, the, high, rate, of, taxation, and, the, reduction, of, the, authority, of, the, parlement, de, paris, and, other, regional, representative, entities, paris, erupted, in, rioting, as, a, result, and, anne, was, forced, under, intense, pressure, to, free, broussel, moreover, on, the, night, of, 9, 10, february, 1651, when, louis, was, twelve, a, mob, of, angry, parisians, broke, into, the, royal, palace, and, demanded, to, see, their, king, led, into, the, royal, bed, chamber, they, gazed, upon, louis, who, was, feigning, sleep, were, appeased, and, then, quietly, departed, the, threat, to, the, royal, family, prompted, anne, to, flee, paris, with, the, king, and, his, courtiers, shortly, thereafter, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, allowed, cond, s, army, to, return, to, aid, louis, and, his, court, cond, s, family, was, close, to, anne, at, that, time, and, he, agreed, to, help, her, attempt, to, restore, the, king, s, authority, the, queen, s, army, headed, by, cond, attacked, the, rebels, in, paris, the, rebels, were, under, the, political, control, of, anne, s, old, friend, marie, de, rohan, beaufort, who, had, escaped, from, the, prison, where, anne, had, incarcerated, him, five, years, before, was, the, military, leader, in, paris, under, the, nominal, control, of, conti, after, a, few, battles, a, political, compromise, was, reached, the, peace, of, rueil, was, signed, and, the, court, returned, to, paris, unfortunately, for, anne, her, partial, victory, depended, on, cond, who, wanted, to, control, the, queen, and, destroy, mazarin, s, influence, it, was, cond, s, sister, who, pushed, him, to, turn, against, the, queen, after, striking, a, deal, with, her, old, friend, marie, de, rohan, who, was, able, to, impose, the, nomination, of, charles, de, l, aubespine, marquis, de, ch, teauneuf, as, minister, of, justice, anne, arrested, cond, his, brother, armand, de, bourbon, prince, of, conti, and, the, husband, of, their, sister, anne, genevieve, de, bourbon, duchess, of, longueville, this, situation, did, not, last, long, and, mazarin, s, unpopularity, led, to, the, creation, of, a, coalition, headed, mainly, by, marie, de, rohan, and, the, duchess, of, longueville, this, aristocratic, coalition, was, strong, enough, to, liberate, the, princes, exile, mazarin, and, impose, a, condition, of, virtual, house, arrest, on, queen, anne, all, these, events, were, witnessed, by, louis, and, largely, explained, his, later, distrust, of, paris, and, the, higher, aristocracy, in, one, sense, louis, s, childhood, came, to, an, end, with, the, outbreak, of, the, fronde, it, was, not, only, that, life, became, insecure, and, unpleasant, a, fate, meted, out, to, many, children, in, all, ages, but, that, louis, had, to, be, taken, into, the, confidence, of, his, mother, and, mazarin, on, political, and, military, matters, of, which, he, could, have, no, deep, understanding, the, family, home, became, at, times, a, near, prison, when, paris, had, to, be, abandoned, not, in, carefree, outings, to, other, chateaux, but, in, humiliating, flights, the, royal, family, was, driven, out, of, paris, twice, in, this, manner, and, at, one, point, louis, xiv, and, anne, were, held, under, virtual, arrest, in, the, royal, palace, in, paris, the, fronde, years, planted, in, louis, a, hatred, of, paris, and, a, consequent, determination, to, move, out, of, the, ancient, capital, as, soon, as, possible, never, to, return, just, as, the, first, fronde, the, fronde, parlementaire, of, 1648, 1649, ended, a, second, one, the, fronde, des, princes, of, 1650, 1653, began, unlike, that, which, preceded, it, tales, of, sordid, intrigue, and, half, hearted, warfare, characterized, this, second, phase, of, upper, class, insurrection, to, the, aristocracy, this, rebellion, represented, a, protest, for, the, reversal, of, their, political, demotion, from, vassals, to, courtiers, it, was, headed, by, the, highest, ranking, french, nobles, among, them, louis, s, uncle, gaston, duke, of, orl, ans, and, first, cousin, anne, marie, louise, d, orl, ans, duchess, of, montpensier, known, as, la, grande, mademoiselle, princes, of, the, blood, such, as, cond, his, brother, armand, de, bourbon, prince, of, conti, and, their, sister, the, duchess, of, longueville, dukes, of, legitimised, royal, descent, such, as, henri, duke, of, longueville, and, fran, ois, duke, of, beaufort, so, called, foreign, princes, such, as, fr, d, ric, maurice, duke, of, bouillon, his, brother, marshal, turenne, and, marie, de, rohan, duchess, of, chevreuse, and, scions, of, france, s, oldest, families, such, as, fran, ois, de, la, rochefoucauld, queen, anne, played, the, most, important, role, in, defeating, the, fronde, because, she, wanted, to, transfer, absolute, authority, to, her, son, in, addition, most, of, the, princes, refused, to, deal, with, mazarin, who, went, into, exile, for, a, number, of, years, the, frondeurs, claimed, to, act, on, louis, s, behalf, and, in, his, real, interest, against, his, mother, and, mazarin, queen, anne, had, a, very, close, relationship, with, the, cardinal, and, many, observers, believed, that, mazarin, became, louis, xiv, s, stepfather, by, a, secret, marriage, to, queen, anne, however, louis, s, coming, of, age, and, subsequent, coronation, deprived, them, of, the, frondeurs, pretext, for, revolt, the, fronde, thus, gradually, lost, steam, and, ended, in, 1653, when, mazarin, returned, triumphantly, from, exile, from, that, time, until, his, death, mazarin, was, in, charge, of, foreign, and, financial, policy, without, the, daily, supervision, of, anne, who, was, no, longer, regent, during, this, period, louis, fell, in, love, with, mazarin, s, niece, marie, mancini, but, anne, and, mazarin, ended, the, king, s, infatuation, by, sending, mancini, away, from, court, to, be, married, in, italy, while, mazarin, might, have, been, tempted, for, a, short, time, to, marry, his, niece, to, the, king, of, france, queen, anne, was, absolutely, against, this, she, wanted, to, marry, her, son, to, the, daughter, of, her, brother, philip, iv, of, spain, for, both, dynastic, and, political, reasons, mazarin, soon, supported, the, queen, s, position, because, he, knew, that, her, support, for, his, power, and, his, foreign, policy, depended, on, making, peace, with, spain, from, a, strong, position, and, on, the, spanish, marriage, additionally, mazarin, s, relations, with, marie, mancini, were, not, good, and, he, did, not, trust, her, to, support, his, position, all, of, louis, s, tears, and, his, supplications, to, his, mother, did, not, make, her, change, her, mind, the, spanish, marriage, would, be, very, important, both, for, its, role, in, ending, the, war, between, france, and, spain, because, many, of, the, claims, and, objectives, of, louis, s, foreign, policy, for, the, next, 50, years, would, be, based, upon, this, marriage, and, because, it, was, through, this, marriage, that, the, spanish, throne, would, ultimately, be, delivered, to, the, house, of, bourbon, louis, xiv, was, declared, to, have, reached, the, age, of, majority, on, the, 7th, of, september, 1651, on, the, death, of, mazarin, in, march, 1661, louis, personally, took, the, reins, of, government, and, astonished, his, court, by, declaring, that, he, would, rule, without, a, chief, minister, up, to, this, moment, i, have, been, pleased, to, entrust, the, government, of, my, affairs, to, the, late, cardinal, it, is, now, time, that, i, govern, them, myself, you, will, assist, me, with, your, counsels, when, i, ask, for, them, i, request, and, order, you, to, seal, no, orders, except, by, my, command, i, order, you, not, to, sign, anything, not, even, a, passport, without, my, command, to, render, account, to, me, personally, each, day, and, to, favor, no, one, capitalizing, on, the, widespread, public, yearning, for, peace, and, order, after, decades, of, foreign, and, civil, strife, the, young, king, consolidated, central, political, authority, and, at, the, expense, of, the, feudal, aristocracy, praising, his, ability, to, choose, and, encourage, men, of, talent, the, historian, chateaubriand, noted, it, is, the, voice, of, genius, of, all, kinds, which, sounds, from, the, tomb, of, louis, louis, began, his, personal, reign, with, administrative, and, fiscal, reforms, in, 1661, the, treasury, verged, on, bankruptcy, to, rectify, the, situation, louis, chose, jean, baptiste, colbert, as, controller, general, of, finances, in, 1665, however, louis, first, had, to, neutralize, nicolas, fouquet, the, powerful, superintendent, of, finances, although, fouquet, s, financial, indiscretions, were, not, very, different, from, mazarin, s, before, him, or, colbert, s, after, him, his, ambition, worried, louis, he, lavishly, entertained, the, king, at, the, opulent, ch, teau, of, vaux, le, vicomte, flaunting, a, wealth, which, could, hardly, have, accumulated, except, through, embezzlement, of, government, funds, fouquet, appeared, eager, to, succeed, mazarin, and, richelieu, in, power, and, he, indiscreetly, purchased, and, privately, fortified, the, remote, island, of, belle, le, these, acts, sealed, his, doom, fouquet, was, charged, with, embezzlement, the, parlement, found, him, guilty, and, sentenced, him, to, exile, and, finally, louis, altered, the, sentence, to, life, imprisonment, fouquet, s, downfall, gave, colbert, a, free, hand, to, reduce, the, national, debt, through, more, efficient, taxation, the, principal, taxes, included, the, aides, and, douanes, both, customs, duties, the, gabelle, salt, tax, and, the, taille, land, tax, the, taille, was, reduced, at, first, and, certain, tax, collection, contracts, were, auctioned, instead, of, being, sold, privately, to, a, favoured, few, financial, officials, were, required, to, keep, regular, accounts, revising, inventories, and, removing, unauthorized, exemptions, up, to, 1661, only, 10, per, cent, of, income, from, the, royal, domain, reached, the, king, reform, had, to, overcome, vested, interests, the, taille, was, collected, by, officers, of, the, crown, who, had, purchased, their, post, at, a, high, price, and, punishment, of, abuses, necessarily, lowered, the, value, of, the, purchase, nevertheless, colbert, achieved, excellent, results, with, the, deficit, of, 1661, turning, into, a, surplus, by, 1666, with, interest, on, the, debt, decreasing, from, 52, million, to, 24, million, livres, the, taille, was, reduced, to, 42, million, in, 1661, and, 35, million, in, 1665, while, revenue, from, indirect, taxation, progressed, from, 26, million, to, 55, million, the, revenues, of, the, royal, domain, were, raised, from, 80, 000, livres, in, 1661, to, 5, 5, million, in, 1671, in, 1661, the, receipts, were, equivalent, to, 26, million, british, pounds, of, which, 10, million, reached, the, treasury, the, expenditure, was, around, 18, million, pounds, leaving, a, deficit, of, 8, million, in, 1667, the, net, receipts, had, risen, to, 20, million, pounds, sterling, while, expenditure, had, fallen, to, 11, million, leaving, a, surplus, of, 9, million, pounds, money, was, the, essential, support, of, the, reorganized, and, enlarged, army, the, panoply, of, versailles, and, the, growing, civil, administration, finance, had, always, been, the, weakness, of, the, french, monarchy, tax, collection, was, costly, and, inefficient, direct, taxes, dwindled, as, they, passed, through, the, hands, of, many, intermediate, officials, and, indirect, taxes, were, collected, by, private, contractors, called, tax, farmers, who, made, a, handsome, profit, the, state, coffers, leaked, at, every, joint, the, main, weakness, arose, from, an, old, bargain, between, the, french, crown, and, nobility, the, king, might, raise, taxes, on, the, nation, without, consent, if, only, he, exempted, the, nobility, only, the, unprivileged, classes, paid, direct, taxes, which, came, to, mean, the, peasants, only, as, most, bourgeois, finagled, exemptions, in, one, way, or, another, the, system, laid, the, whole, burden, of, state, expenses, on, the, backs, of, the, poor, and, powerless, after, 1700, with, the, support, of, louis, s, pious, secret, wife, madame, de, maintenon, the, king, was, persuaded, to, change, his, fiscal, policy, though, willing, enough, to, tax, the, nobles, louis, feared, the, political, concessions, which, they, would, demand, in, return, only, towards, the, close, of, his, reign, under, the, extreme, exigency, of, war, was, he, able, for, the, first, time, in, french, history, to, impose, direct, taxes, on, the, aristocracy, this, was, a, step, toward, equality, before, the, law, and, toward, sound, public, finance, though, it, was, predictably, diminished, by, concessions, and, exemptions, won, by, the, insistent, efforts, of, nobles, and, bourgeois, louis, and, colbert, also, had, wide, ranging, plans, to, grow, french, commerce, and, trade, colbert, s, mercantilist, administration, established, new, industries, and, encouraged, manufacturers, and, inventors, such, as, the, lyon, silk, manufacturers, and, the, gobelins, tapestry, manufactory, he, invited, manufacturers, and, artisans, from, all, over, europe, to, france, such, as, murano, glassmakers, swedish, ironworkers, and, dutch, shipbuilders, he, aimed, to, decrease, imports, while, increasing, french, exports, hence, reducing, the, net, outflow, of, precious, metals, from, france, louis, instituted, reforms, in, military, administration, through, michel, le, tellier, and, his, son, fran,

professional, disciplined, well, trained, force, he, was, devoted, to, the, soldiers, material, well, being, and, morale, and, even, tried, to, direct, campaigns, louis, s, legal, reforms, were, enacted, in, his, numerous, great, ordinances, prior, to, that, france, was, a, patchwork, of, legal, systems, with, as, many, traditional, legal, regimes, as, there, were, provinces, and, two, co, existing, legal, systems, customary, law, in, the, north, and, roman, civil, law, in, the, south, the, grande, ordonnance, de, proc, dure, civile, of, 1667, the, code, louis, was, a, comprehensive, legal, code, imposing, a, uniform, regulation, of, civil, procedure, throughout, the, kingdom, among, other, things, it, prescribed, baptismal, marriage, and, death, records, in, the, state, s, registers, not, the, church, s, and, it, strictly, regulated, the, right, of, the, parlements, to, remonstrate, the, code, louis, later, became, the, basis, for, the, napoleonic, code, which, in, turn, inspired, many, modern, legal, codes, one, of, louis, s, more, infamous, decrees, was, the, grande, ordonnance, sur, les, colonies, of, 1685, the, code, noir, black, code, although, it, sanctioned, slavery, it, attempted, to, humanise, the, practice, by, prohibiting, the, separation, of, families, additionally, in, the, colonies, only, roman, catholics, could, own, slaves, and, these, had, to, be, baptised, louis, ruled, through, a, number, of, councils, the, death, of, louis, s, maternal, uncle, king, philip, iv, of, spain, in, 1665, precipitated, the, war, of, devolution, in, 1660, louis, had, married, philip, iv, s, eldest, daughter, maria, theresa, as, one, of, the, provisions, of, the, 1659, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, the, marriage, treaty, specified, that, maria, theresa, was, to, renounce, all, claims, to, spanish, territory, for, herself, and, all, her, descendants, mazarin, and, lionne, however, made, the, renunciation, conditional, on, the, full, payment, of, a, spanish, dowry, of, 500, 000, cus, the, dowry, was, never, paid, and, would, later, play, a, part, persuading, his, maternal, first, cousin, charles, ii, of, spain, to, leave, his, empire, to, philip, duke, of, anjou, later, philip, v, of, spain, the, grandson, of, louis, xiv, and, maria, theresa, the, war, of, devolution, did, not, focus, on, the, payment, of, the, dowry, rather, the, lack, of, payment, was, what, louis, xiv, used, as, a, pretext, for, nullifying, maria, theresa, s, renunciation, of, her, claims, allowing, the, land, to, devolve, to, him, in, brabant, the, location, of, the, land, in, dispute, children, of, first, marriages, traditionally, were, not, disadvantaged, by, their, parents, remarriages, and, still, inherited, property, louis, s, wife, was, philip, iv, s, daughter, by, his, first, marriage, while, the, new, king, of, spain, charles, ii, was, his, son, by, a, subsequent, marriage, thus, brabant, allegedly, devolved, to, maria, theresa, justifying, france, to, attack, the, spanish, netherlands, during, the, eighty, years, war, with, spain, france, supported, the, dutch, republic, as, part, of, a, general, policy, of, opposing, habsburg, power, johan, de, witt, dutch, grand, pensionary, from, 1653, to, 1672, viewed, this, as, crucial, for, dutch, security, and, a, counterweight, against, his, domestic, orangist, opponents, louis, provided, support, in, the, 1665, 1667, second, anglo, dutch, war, but, used, the, opportunity, to, launch, the, war, of, devolution, in, 1667, this, captured, franche, comt, and, much, of, the, spanish, netherlands, french, expansion, in, this, area, was, a, direct, threat, to, dutch, economic, interests, the, dutch, opened, talks, with, charles, ii, of, england, on, a, common, diplomatic, front, against, france, leading, to, the, triple, alliance, between, england, the, dutch, and, sweden, the, threat, of, an, escalation, and, a, secret, treaty, to, divide, spanish, possessions, with, emperor, leopold, the, other, major, claimant, to, the, throne, of, spain, led, louis, to, relinquish, many, of, his, gains, in, the, 1668, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, louis, placed, little, reliance, on, his, agreement, with, leopold, and, as, it, was, now, clear, french, and, dutch, aims, were, in, direct, conflict, he, decided, to, first, defeat, the, republic, then, seize, the, spanish, netherlands, this, required, breaking, up, the, triple, alliance, he, paid, sweden, to, remain, neutral, and, signed, the, 1670, secret, treaty, of, dover, with, charles, an, anglo, french, alliance, against, the, dutch, republic, in, may, 1672, france, invaded, the, republic, supported, by, m, nster, and, the, electorate, of, cologne, rapid, french, advance, led, to, a, coup, that, toppled, de, witt, and, brought, william, iii, to, power, leopold, viewed, french, expansion, into, the, rhineland, as, an, increasing, threat, especially, after, they, seized, the, strategic, duchy, of, lorraine, in, 1670, the, prospect, of, dutch, defeat, led, leopold, to, an, alliance, with, brandenburg, prussia, on, 23, june, followed, by, another, with, the, republic, on, 25th, although, brandenburg, was, forced, out, of, the, war, by, the, june, 1673, treaty, of, vossem, in, august, an, anti, french, alliance, was, formed, by, the, dutch, spain, emperor, leopold, and, the, duke, of, lorraine, the, french, alliance, was, deeply, unpopular, in, england, and, only, more, so, after, the, disappointing, battles, against, michiel, de, ruyter, s, fleet, charles, ii, of, england, made, peace, with, the, dutch, in, the, february, 1674, treaty, of, westminster, however, french, armies, held, significant, advantages, over, their, opponents, an, undivided, command, talented, generals, like, turenne, cond, and, luxembourg, and, vastly, superior, logistics, reforms, introduced, by, louvois, the, secretary, of, war, helped, maintain, large, field, armies, that, could, be, mobilised, much, more, quickly, allowing, them, to, mount, offensives, in, early, spring, before, their, opponents, were, ready, the, french, were, nevertheless, forced, to, retreat, from, most, of, the, dutch, republic, which, deeply, shocked, louis, he, retreated, to, st, germain, for, a, time, where, no, one, except, a, few, intimates, was, allowed, to, disturb, him, french, military, advantages, allowed, them, however, to, hold, their, ground, in, alsace, and, the, spanish, netherlands, while, retaking, franche, comt, by, 1678, mutual, exhaustion, led, to, the, treaty, of, nijmegen, which, was, generally, settled, in, france, s, favour, and, allowed, louis, to, intervene, in, the, scanian, war, despite, the, military, defeat, his, ally, sweden, regained, much, of, what, it, had, lost, under, the, 1679, treaties, of, saint, germain, en, laye, fontainebleau, and, lund, imposed, on, denmark, norway, and, brandenburg, yet, louis, s, two, primary, goals, the, destruction, of, the, dutch, republic, and, the, conquest, of, the, spanish, netherlands, had, failed, louis, was, at, the, height, of, his, power, but, at, the, cost, of, uniting, his, opponents, this, increased, as, he, continued, his, expansion, in, 1679, he, dismissed, his, foreign, minister, simon, arnauld, marquis, de, pomponne, because, he, was, seen, as, having, compromised, too, much, with, the, allies, louis, maintained, the, strength, of, his, army, but, in, his, next, series, of, territorial, claims, avoided, using, military, force, alone, rather, he, combined, it, with, legal, pretexts, in, his, efforts, to, augment, the, boundaries, of, his, kingdom, contemporary, treaties, were, intentionally, phrased, ambiguously, louis, established, the, chambers, of, reunion, to, determine, the, full, extent, of, his, rights, and, obligations, under, those, treaties, cities, and, territories, such, as, luxembourg, and, casale, were, prized, for, their, strategic, positions, on, the, frontier, and, access, to, important, waterways, louis, also, sought, strasbourg, an, important, strategic, crossing, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, and, theretofore, a, free, imperial, city, of, the, holy, roman, empire, annexing, it, and, other, territories, in, 1681, although, a, part, of, alsace, strasbourg, was, not, part, of, habsburg, ruled, alsace, and, was, thus, not, ceded, to, france, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, following, these, annexations, spain, declared, war, precipitating, the, war, of, the, reunions, however, the, spanish, were, rapidly, defeated, because, the, emperor, distracted, by, the, great, turkish, war, abandoned, them, and, the, dutch, only, supported, them, minimally, by, the, truce, of, ratisbon, in, 1684, spain, was, forced, to, acquiesce, in, the, french, occupation, of, most, of, the, conquered, territories, for, 20, years, louis, s, policy, of, the, r, unions, may, have, raised, france, to, its, greatest, size, and, power, during, his, reign, but, it, alienated, much, of, europe, this, poor, public, opinion, was, compounded, by, french, actions, off, the, barbary, coast, and, at, genoa, first, louis, had, algiers, and, tripoli, two, barbary, pirate, strongholds, bombarded, to, obtain, a, favourable, treaty, and, the, liberation, of, christian, slaves, next, in, 1684, a, punitive, mission, was, launched, against, genoa, in, retaliation, for, its, support, for, spain, in, previous, wars, although, the, genoese, submitted, and, the, doge, led, an, official, mission, of, apology, to, versailles, france, gained, a, reputation, for, brutality, and, arrogance, european, apprehension, at, growing, french, might, and, the, realisation, of, the, extent, of, the, dragonnades, effect, discussed, below, led, many, states, to, abandon, their, alliances, with, france, accordingly, by, the, late, 1680s, france, became, increasingly, isolated, in, europe, french, colonies, multiplied, in, africa, the, americas, and, asia, during, louis, s, reign, and, french, explorers, made, important, discoveries, in, north, america, in, 1673, louis, jolliet, and, jacques, marquette, discovered, the, mississippi, river, in, 1682, ren, robert, cavelier, sieur, de, la, salle, followed, the, mississippi, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, claimed, the, vast, mississippi, basin, in, louis, s, name, calling, it, louisiane, french, trading, posts, were, also, established, in, india, at, chandernagore, and, pondicherry, and, in, the, indian, ocean, at, le, bourbon, throughout, these, regions, louis, and, colbert, embarked, on, an, extensive, program, of, architecture, and, urbanism, meant, to, reflect, the, styles, of, versailles, and, paris, and, the, gloire, of, the, realm, meanwhile, diplomatic, relations, were, initiated, with, distant, countries, in, 1669, suleiman, aga, led, an, ottoman, embassy, to, revive, the, old, franco, ottoman, alliance, then, in, 1682, after, the, reception, of, the, moroccan, embassy, of, mohammed, tenim, in, france, moulay, ismail, sultan, of, morocco, allowed, french, consular, and, commercial, establishments, in, his, country, in, 1699, louis, once, again, received, a, moroccan, ambassador, abdallah, bin, aisha, and, in, 1715, he, received, a, persian, embassy, led, by, mohammad, reza, beg, from, farther, afield, siam, dispatched, an, embassy, in, 1684, reciprocated, by, the, french, magnificently, the, next, year, under, alexandre, chevalier, de, chaumont, this, in, turn, was, succeeded, by, another, siamese, embassy, under, kosa, pan, superbly, received, at, versailles, in, 1686, louis, then, sent, another, embassy, in, 1687, under, simon, de, la, loub, re, and, french, influence, grew, at, the, siamese, court, which, granted, mergui, as, a, naval, base, to, france, however, the, death, of, narai, king, of, ayutthaya, the, execution, of, his, pro, french, minister, constantine, phaulkon, and, the, siege, of, bangkok, in, 1688, ended, this, era, of, french, influence, france, also, attempted, to, participate, actively, in, jesuit, missions, to, china, to, break, the, portuguese, dominance, there, louis, sent, jesuit, missionaries, to, the, court, of, the, kangxi, emperor, in, 1685, jean, de, fontaney, joachim, bouvet, jean, fran, ois, gerbillon, louis, le, comte, and, claude, de, visdelou, louis, also, received, a, chinese, jesuit, michael, shen, fu, tsung, at, versailles, in, 1684, furthermore, louis, s, librarian, and, translator, arcadio, huang, was, chinese, by, the, early, 1680s, louis, had, greatly, augmented, french, influence, in, the, world, domestically, he, successfully, increased, the, influence, of, the, crown, and, its, authority, over, the, church, and, aristocracy, thus, consolidating, absolute, monarchy, in, france, louis, initially, supported, traditional, gallicanism, which, limited, papal, authority, in, france, and, convened, an, assembly, of, the, french, clergy, in, november, 1681, before, its, dissolution, eight, months, later, the, assembly, had, accepted, the, declaration, of, the, clergy, of, france, which, increased, royal, authority, at, the, expense, of, papal, power, without, royal, approval, bishops, could, not, leave, france, and, appeals, could, not, be, made, to, the, pope, additionally, government, officials, could, not, be, excommunicated, for, acts, committed, in, pursuance, of, their, duties, although, the, king, could, not, make, ecclesiastical, law, all, papal, regulations, without, royal, assent, were, invalid, in, france, unsurprisingly, the, pope, repudiated, the, declaration, by, attaching, nobles, to, his, court, at, versailles, louis, achieved, increased, control, over, the, french, aristocracy, according, to, historian, philip, mansel, the, king, turned, the, palace, into, apartments, were, built, to, house, those, willing, to, pay, court, to, the, king, however, the, pensions, and, privileges, necessary, to, live, in, a, style, appropriate, to, their, rank, were, only, possible, by, waiting, constantly, on, louis, for, this, purpose, an, elaborate, court, ritual, was, created, wherein, the, king, became, the, centre, of, attention, and, was, observed, throughout, the, day, by, the, public, with, his, excellent, memory, louis, could, then, see, who, attended, him, at, court, and, who, was, absent, facilitating, the, subsequent, distribution, of, favours, and, positions, another, tool, louis, used, to, control, his, nobility, was, censorship, which, often, involved, the, opening, of, letters, to, discern, their, author, s, opinion, of, the, government, and, king, moreover, by, entertaining, impressing, and, domesticating, them, with, extravagant, luxury, and, other, distractions, louis, not, only, cultivated, public, opinion, of, him, but, he, also, ensured, the, aristocracy, remained, under, his, scrutiny, louis, s, extravagance, at, versailles, extended, far, beyond, the, scope, of, elaborate, court, rituals, he, took, delivery, of, an, african, elephant, as, a, gift, from, the, king, of, portugal, he, encouraged, leading, nobles, to, live, at, versailles, this, along, with, the, prohibition, of, private, armies, prevented, them, from, passing, time, on, their, own, estates, and, in, their, regional, power, bases, from, which, they, historically, waged, local, wars, and, plotted, resistance, to, royal, authority, louis, thus, compelled, and, seduced, the, old, military, aristocracy, the, nobility, of, the, sword, into, becoming, his, ceremonial, courtiers, further, weakening, their, power, in, their, place, he, raised, commoners, or, the, more, recently, ennobled, bureaucratic, aristocracy, the, nobility, of, the, robe, he, judged, that, royal, authority, thrived, more, surely, by, filling, high, executive, and, administrative, positions, with, these, men, because, they, could, be, more, easily, dismissed, than, nobles, of, ancient, lineage, and, entrenched, influence, it, is, believed, that, louis, s, policies, were, rooted, in, his, experiences, during, the, fronde, when, men, of, high, birth, readily, took, up, the, rebel, cause, against, their, king, who, was, actually, the, kinsman, of, some, this, victory, over, the, nobility, may, thus, have, ensured, the, end, of, major, civil, wars, in, france, until, the, french, revolution, about, a, century, later, under, louis, france, was, the, leading, european, power, and, most, wars, pivoted, around, its, aggressiveness, no, european, state, exceeded, it, in, population, and, no, one, could, match, its, wealth, central, location, and, very, strong, professional, army, it, had, largely, avoided, the, devastation, of, the, thirty, years, war, its, weaknesses, included, an, inefficient, financial, system, that, was, hard, pressed, to, pay, for, its, military, adventures, and, the, tendency, of, most, other, powers, to, gang, up, against, it, during, louis, s, reign, france, fought, three, major, wars, the, franco, dutch, war, the, war, of, the, league, of, augsburg, and, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, there, were, also, two, lesser, conflicts, the, war, of, devolution, and, the, war, of, the, reunions, the, wars, were, very, expensive, but, defined, louis, xiv, s, foreign, policy, and, his, personality, shaped, his, approach, impelled, by, a, mix, of, commerce, revenge, and, pique, louis, sensed, that, war, was, the, ideal, way, to, enhance, his, glory, in, peacetime, he, concentrated, on, preparing, for, the, next, war, he, taught, his, diplomats, that, their, job, was, to, create, tactical, and, strategic, advantages, for, the, french, military, by, 1695, france, retained, much, of, its, dominance, but, had, lost, control, of, the, seas, to, england, and, holland, and, most, countries, both, protestant, and, catholic, were, in, alliance, against, it, s, bastien, le, prestre, de, vauban, france, s, leading, military, strategist, warned, louis, in, 1689, that, a, hostile, alliance, was, too, powerful, at, sea, he, recommended, that, france, fight, back, by, licensing, french, merchant, ships, to, privateer, and, seize, enemy, merchant, ships, while, avoiding, its, navies, vauban, was, pessimistic, about, france, s, so, called, friends, and, allies, louis, decided, to, persecute, protestants, and, revoke, the, 1598, edict, of, nantes, which, awarded, huguenots, political, and, religious, freedom, he, saw, the, persistence, of, protestantism, as, a, disgraceful, reminder, of, royal, powerlessness, after, all, the, edict, was, the, pragmatic, concession, of, his, grandfather, henry, iv, to, end, the, longstanding, french, wars, of, religion, an, additional, factor, in, louis, s, thinking, was, the, prevailing, contemporary, european, principle, to, assure, socio, political, stability, cuius, regio, eius, religio, whose, realm, his, religion, the, idea, that, the, religion, of, the, ruler, should, be, the, religion, of, the, realm, as, originally, confirmed, in, central, europe, in, the, peace, of, augsburg, of, 1555, responding, to, petitions, louis, initially, excluded, protestants, from, office, constrained, the, meeting, of, synods, closed, churches, outside, of, edict, stipulated, areas, banned, protestant, outdoor, preachers, and, prohibited, domestic, protestant, migration, he, also, disallowed, protestant, catholic, intermarriages, to, which, third, parties, objected, encouraged, missions, to, the, protestants, and, rewarded, converts, to, catholicism, this, discrimination, did, not, encounter, much, protestant, resistance, and, a, steady, conversion, of, protestants, occurred, especially, among, the, noble, elites, in, 1681, louis, dramatically, increased, his, persecution, of, protestants, the, principle, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, generally, also, meant, that, subjects, who, refused, to, convert, could, emigrate, but, louis, banned, emigration, and, effectively, insisted, that, all, protestants, must, be, converted, secondly, following, the, proposal, of, ren, de, marillac, and, the, marquis, of, louvois, he, began, quartering, dragoons, in, protestant, homes, although, this, was, within, his, legal, rights, the, dragonnades, inflicted, severe, financial, strain, on, protestants, and, atrocious, abuse, between, 300, 000, and, 400, 000, huguenots, converted, as, this, entailed, financial, rewards, and, exemption, from, the, dragonnades, on, 15, october, 1685, louis, issued, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, which, cited, the, redundancy, of, privileges, for, protestants, given, their, scarcity, after, the, extensive, conversions, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, revoked, the, edict, of, nantes, and, repealed, all, the, privileges, that, arose, therefrom, by, his, edict, louis, no, longer, tolerated, the, existence, of, protestant, groups, pastors, or, churches, in, france, no, further, churches, were, to, be, constructed, and, those, already, existing, were, to, be, demolished, pastors, could, choose, either, exile, or, secular, life, those, protestants, who, had, resisted, conversion, were, now, to, be, baptised, forcibly, into, the, established, church, historians, have, debated, louis, s, reasons, for, issuing, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, he, may, have, been, seeking, to, placate, pope, innocent, xi, with, whom, relations, were, tense, and, whose, aid, was, necessary, to, determine, the, outcome, of, a, succession, crisis, in, the, electorate, of, cologne, he, may, also, have, acted, to, upstage, emperor, leopold, i, and, regain, international, prestige, after, the, latter, defeated, the, turks, without, louis, s, help, otherwise, he, may, simply, have, desired, to, end, the, remaining, divisions, in, french, society, dating, to, the, wars, of, religion, by, fulfilling, his, coronation, oath, to, eradicate, heresy, many, historians, have, condemned, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, as, gravely, harmful, to, france, in, support, they, cite, the, emigration, of, about, 200, 000, highly, skilled, huguenots, roughly, one, quarter, of, the, protestant, population, or, 1, of, the, french, population, who, defied, royal, decrees, and, fled, france, for, various, protestant, states, weakening, the, french, economy, and, enriching, that, of, protestant, states, on, the, other, hand, some, historians, view, this, as, an, exaggeration, they, argue, that, most, of, france, s, preeminent, protestant, businessmen, and, industrialists, converted, to, catholicism, and, remained, what, is, certain, is, that, the, reaction, to, the, edict, was, mixed, even, while, french, catholic, leaders, exulted, pope, innocent, xi, still, argued, with, louis, over, gallicanism, and, criticized, the, use, of, violence, protestants, across, europe, were, horrified, at, the, treatment, of, their, co, religionists, but, most, catholics, in, france, applauded, the, move, nonetheless, it, is, indisputable, that, louis, s, public, image, in, most, of, europe, especially, in, protestant, regions, was, dealt, a, severe, blow, in, the, end, however, despite, renewed, tensions, with, the, camisards, of, south, central, france, at, the, end, of, his, reign, louis, may, have, helped, ensure, that, his, successor, would, experience, fewer, instances, of, the, religion, based, disturbances, that, had, plagued, his, forebears, french, society, would, sufficiently, change, by, the, time, of, his, descendant, louis, xvi, to, welcome, tolerance, in, the, form, of, the, 1787, edict, of, versailles, also, known, as, the, edict, of, tolerance, this, restored, to, non, catholics, their, civil, rights, and, the, freedom, to, worship, openly, with, the, advent, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, protestants, were, granted, equal, rights, with, their, roman, catholic, counterparts, the, nine, years, war, which, lasted, from, 1688, to, 1697, initiated, a, period, of, decline, in, louis, s, political, and, diplomatic, fortunes, it, arose, from, two, events, in, the, rhineland, first, in, 1685, the, elector, palatine, charles, ii, died, all, that, remained, of, his, immediate, family, was, louis, s, sister, in, law, elizabeth, charlotte, german, law, ostensibly, barred, her, from, succeeding, to, her, brother, s, lands, and, electoral, dignity, but, it, was, unclear, enough, for, arguments, in, favour, of, elizabeth, charlotte, to, have, a, chance, of, success, conversely, the, princess, was, clearly, entitled, to, a, division, of, the, family, s, personal, property, louis, pressed, her, claims, to, land, and, chattels, hoping, the, latter, at, least, would, be, given, to, her, then, in, 1688, maximilian, henry, of, bavaria, archbishop, of, cologne, an, ally, of, france, died, the, archbishopric, had, traditionally, been, held, by, the, wittelsbachs, of, bavaria, but, the, bavarian, claimant, to, replace, maximilian, henry, prince, joseph, clemens, of, bavaria, was, at, that, time, not, more, than, 17, years, old, and, not, even, ordained, louis, sought, instead, to, install, his, own, candidate, wilhelm, egon, von, f, rstenberg, to, ensure, the, key, rhenish, state, remained, an, ally, in, light, of, his, foreign, and, domestic, policies, during, the, early, 1680s, which, were, perceived, as, aggressive, louis, s, actions, fostered, by, the, succession, crises, of, the, late, 1680s, created, concern, and, alarm, in, much, of, europe, this, led, to, the, formation, of, the, 1686, league, of, augsburg, by, the, holy, roman, emperor, spain, sweden, saxony, and, bavaria, their, stated, intention, was, to, return, france, to, at, least, the, borders, agreed, to, in, the, treaty, of, nijmegen, emperor, leopold, i, s, persistent, refusal, to, convert, the, truce, of, ratisbon, into, a, permanent, treaty, fed, louis, s, fears, that, the, emperor, would, turn, on, france, and, attack, the, reunions, after, settling, his, affairs, in, the, balkans, another, event, louis, found, threatening, was, england, s, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, although, king, james, ii, was, catholic, his, two, anglican, daughters, mary, and, anne, ensured, the, english, people, a, protestant, succession, but, when, james, ii, s, son, james, francis, edward, stuart, was, born, he, took, precedence, in, succession, over, his, sisters, this, seemed, to, herald, an, era, of, catholic, monarchs, in, england, protestant, lords, called, on, the, dutch, prince, william, iii, of, orange, grandson, of, charles, i, of, england, to, come, to, their, aid, he, sailed, for, england, with, troops, despite, louis, s, warning, that, france, would, regard, it, as, a, provocation, witnessing, numerous, desertions, and, defections, even, among, those, closest, to, him, james, ii, fled, england, parliament, declared, the, throne, vacant, and, offered, it, to, james, s, daughter, mary, ii, and, his, son, in, law, and, nephew, william, vehemently, anti, french, william, now, william, iii, of, england, pushed, his, new, kingdoms, into, war, thus, transforming, the, league, of, augsburg, into, the, grand, alliance, before, this, happened, louis, expected, william, s, expedition, to, england, to, absorb, his, energies, and, those, of, his, allies, so, he, dispatched, troops, to, the, rhineland, after, the, expiry, of, his, ultimatum, to, the, german, princes, requiring, confirmation, of, the, truce, of, ratisbon, and, acceptance, of, his, demands, about, the, succession, crises, this, military, manoeuvre, was, also, intended, to, protect, his, eastern, provinces, from, imperial, invasion, by, depriving, the, enemy, army, of, sustenance, thus, explaining, the, preemptive, scorched, earth, policy, pursued, in, much, of, southwestern, germany, the, devastation, of, the, palatinate, french, armies, were, generally, victorious, throughout, the, war, because, of, imperial, commitments, in, the, balkans, french, logistical, superiority, and, the, quality, of, french, generals, such, as, cond, s, famous, pupil, fran, ois, henri, de, montmorency, bouteville, duc, de, luxembourg, he, triumphed, at, the, battles, of, fleurus, in, 1690, steenkerque, in, 1692, and, landen, in, 1693, although, the, battles, proved, to, be, of, little, of, strategic, consequence, mostly, due, to, the, nature, of, late, 17th, century, warfare, although, an, attempt, to, restore, james, ii, failed, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, in, 1690, france, accumulated, a, string, of, victories, from, flanders, in, the, north, germany, in, the, east, and, italy, and, spain, in, the, south, to, the, high, seas, and, the, colonies, louis, personally, supervised, the, captures, of, mons, in, 1691, and, namur, in, 1692, luxembourg, gave, france, the, defensive, line, of, the, sambre, by, capturing, charleroi, in, 1693, france, also, overran, most, of, the, duchy, of, savoy, after, the, battles, of, marsaglia, and, staffarde, in, 1693, while, naval, stalemate, ensued, after, the, french, victory, at, the, battle, of, beachy, head, in, 1690, and, the, allied, victory, at, barfleur, la, hougue, in, 1692, the, battle, of, torroella, in, 1694, exposed, catalonia, to, french, invasion, culminating, in, the, capture, of, barcelona, the, dutch, captured, pondich, ry, in, 1693, but, a, 1697, french, raid, on, the, spanish, treasure, port, of, cartagena, spain, yielded, a, fortune, of, 10, 000, 000, livres, in, july, 1695, the, city, of, namur, occupied, for, three, years, by, the, french, was, besieged, by, an, allied, army, led, by, william, iii, louis, xiv, ordered, the, surprise, destruction, of, a, flemish, city, to, divert, the, attention, of, these, troops, this, led, to, the, bombardment, of, brussels, in, which, more, than, 4, 000, buildings, were, destroyed, including, the, entire, city, centre, the, strategy, failed, as, namur, fell, three, weeks, later, but, harmed, louis, xiv, s, reputation, a, century, later, napoleon, deemed, the, bombardment, as, barbarous, as, it, was, useless, peace, was, broached, by, sweden, in, 1690, by, 1692, both, sides, evidently, wanted, peace, and, secret, bilateral, talks, began, but, to, no, avail, louis, tried, to, break, up, the, alliance, against, him, by, dealing, with, individual, opponents, but, did, not, achieve, his, aim, until, 1696, when, the, savoyards, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, turin, and, switched, sides, thereafter, members, of, the, league, of, augsburg, rushed, to, the, peace, table, and, negotiations, for, a, general, peace, began, in, earnest, culminating, in, the, peace, of, ryswick, of, 1697, the, peace, of, ryswick, ended, the, war, of, the, league, of, augsburg, and, disbanded, the, grand, alliance, by, manipulating, their, rivalries, and, suspicions, louis, divided, his, enemies, and, broke, their, power, the, treaty, yielded, many, benefits, for, france, louis, secured, permanent, french, sovereignty, over, all, of, alsace, including, strasbourg, and, established, the, rhine, as, the, franco, german, border, as, it, is, to, this, day, pondich, ry, and, acadia, were, returned, to, france, and, louis, s, de, facto, possession, of, saint, domingue, was, recognised, as, lawful, however, he, returned, catalonia, and, most, of, the, reunions, french, military, superiority, might, have, allowed, him, to, press, for, more, advantageous, terms, thus, his, generosity, to, spain, with, regard, to, catalonia, has, been, read, as, a, concession, to, foster, pro, french, sentiment, and, may, ultimately, have, induced, king, charles, ii, to, name, louis, s, grandson, philip, duke, of, anjou, heir, to, the, spanish, throne, in, exchange, for, financial, compensation, france, renounced, its, interests, in, the, electorate, of, cologne, and, the, palatinate, lorraine, which, had, been, occupied, by, the, french, since, 1670, was, returned, to, its, rightful, duke, leopold, albeit, with, a, right, of, way, to, the, french, military, william, and, mary, were, recognised, as, joint, sovereigns, of, the, british, isles, and, louis, withdrew, support, for, james, ii, the, dutch, were, given, the, right, to, garrison, forts, in, the, spanish, netherlands, that, acted, as, a, protective, barrier, against, possible, french, aggression, though, in, some, respects, the, treaty, of, ryswick, may, appear, a, diplomatic, defeat, for, louis, since, he, failed, to, place, client, rulers, in, control, of, the, palatinate, or, the, electorate, of, cologne, he, did, fulfil, many, of, the, aims, laid, down, in, his, 1688, ultimatum, in, any, case, peace, in, 1697, was, desirable, to, louis, since, france, was, exhausted, from, the, costs, of, the, war, by, the, time, of, the, peace, of, ryswick, the, spanish, succession, had, been, a, source, of, concern, to, european, leaders, for, well, over, forty, years, king, charles, ii, ruled, a, vast, empire, comprising, spain, naples, sicily, milan, the, spanish, netherlands, and, numerous, spanish, colonies, he, produced, no, children, however, and, consequently, had, no, direct, heirs, the, principal, claimants, to, the, throne, of, spain, belonged, to, the, ruling, families, of, france, and, austria, the, french, claim, derived, from, louis, xiv, s, mother, anne, of, austria, the, older, sister, of, philip, iv, of, spain, and, his, wife, maria, theresa, philip, iv, s, eldest, daughter, based, on, the, laws, of, primogeniture, france, had, the, better, claim, as, it, originated, from, the, eldest, daughters, in, two, generations, however, their, renunciation, of, succession, rights, complicated, matters, in, the, case, of, maria, theresa, nonetheless, the, renunciation, was, considered, null, and, void, owing, to, spain, s, breach, of, her, marriage, contract, with, louis, in, contrast, no, renunciations, tainted, the, claims, of, emperor, leopold, i, s, son, charles, archduke, of, austria, who, was, a, grandson, of, philip, iii, s, youngest, daughter, maria, anna, the, english, and, dutch, feared, that, a, french, or, austrian, born, spanish, king, would, threaten, the, balance, of, power, and, thus, preferred, the, bavarian, prince, joseph, ferdinand, a, grandson, of, leopold, i, through, his, first, wife, margaret, theresa, of, spain, the, younger, daughter, of, philip, iv, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, war, louis, signed, the, treaty, of, the, hague, with, william, iii, of, england, in, 1698, this, agreement, divided, spain, s, italian, territories, between, louis, s, son, le, grand, dauphin, and, archduke, charles, with, the, rest, of, the, empire, awarded, to, joseph, ferdinand, william, iii, consented, to, permitting, the, dauphin, s, new, territories, to, become, part, of, france, when, the, latter, succeeded, to, his, father, s, throne, the, signatories, however, omitted, to, consult, the, ruler, of, these, lands, and, charles, ii, was, passionately, opposed, to, the, dismemberment, of, his, empire, in, 1699, he, re, confirmed, his, 1693, will, that, named, joseph, ferdinand, as, his, sole, successor, six, months, later, joseph, ferdinand, died, therefore, in, 1700, louis, and, william, iii, concluded, a, fresh, partitioning, agreement, the, treaty, of, london, this, allocated, spain, the, low, countries, and, the, spanish, colonies, to, the, archduke, the, dauphin, would, receive, all, of, spain, s, italian, territories, charles, ii, acknowledged, that, his, empire, could, only, remain, undivided, by, bequeathing, it, entirely, to, a, frenchman, or, an, austrian, under, pressure, from, his, german, wife, maria, anna, of, neuburg, charles, ii, named, archduke, charles, as, his, sole, heir, on, his, deathbed, in, 1700, charles, ii, of, spain, unexpectedly, changed, his, will, the, clear, demonstration, of, french, military, superiority, for, many, decades, before, this, time, the, pro, french, faction, at, the, court, of, spain, and, even, pope, innocent, xii, convinced, him, that, france, was, more, likely, to, preserve, his, empire, intact, he, thus, offered, the, entire, empire, to, the, dauphin, s, second, son, philip, duke, of, anjou, provided, it, remained, undivided, anjou, was, not, in, the, direct, line, of, french, succession, thus, his, accession, would, not, cause, a, franco, spanish, union, if, anjou, refused, the, throne, would, be, offered, to, his, younger, brother, charles, duke, of, berry, if, the, duke, of, berry, declined, it, it, would, go, to, archduke, charles, then, to, the, distantly, related, house, of, savoy, if, charles, declined, it, louis, was, confronted, with, a, difficult, choice, he, could, agree, to, a, partition, of, the, spanish, possessions, and, avoid, a, general, war, or, accept, charles, ii, s, will, and, alienate, much, of, europe, he, may, initially, have, been, inclined, to, abide, by, the, partition, treaties, but, the, dauphin, s, insistence, persuaded, him, otherwise, moreover, louis, s, foreign, minister, jean, baptiste, colbert, marquis, de, torcy, pointed, out, that, war, with, the, emperor, would, almost, certainly, ensue, whether, louis, accepted, the, partition, treaties, or, charles, ii, s, will, he, emphasised, that, should, it, come, to, war, william, iii, was, unlikely, to, stand, by, france, since, he, made, a, treaty, to, avoid, war, and, did, not, intend, to, go, to, war, to, implement, the, treaty, indeed, in, the, event, of, war, it, might, be, preferable, to, be, already, in, control, of, the, disputed, lands, eventually, therefore, louis, decided, to, accept, charles, ii, s, will, philip, duke, of, anjou, thus, became, philip, v, king, of, spain, most, european, rulers, accepted, philip, as, king, some, reluctantly, depending, on, one, s, views, of, the, war, s, inevitability, louis, acted, reasonably, or, arrogantly, he, confirmed, that, philip, v, retained, his, french, rights, despite, his, new, spanish, position, admittedly, he, may, only, have, been, hypothesising, a, theoretical, eventuality, and, not, attempting, a, franco, spanish, union, but, his, actions, were, certainly, not, read, as, disinterested, moreover, louis, sent, troops, to, the, spanish, netherlands, to, evict, dutch, garrisons, and, secure, dutch, recognition, of, philip, v, in, 1701, philip, transferred, the, asiento, the, right, to, supply, slaves, to, spanish, colonies, to, france, as, a, sign, of, the, two, nations, growing, connections, as, tensions, mounted, louis, decided, to, acknowledge, james, stuart, the, son, of, james, ii, as, king, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, on, the, latter, s, death, infuriating, william, iii, these, actions, enraged, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, with, the, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, petty, german, states, they, formed, another, grand, alliance, and, declared, war, on, france, in, 1702, french, diplomacy, secured, bavaria, portugal, and, savoy, as, franco, spanish, allies, even, before, war, was, officially, declared, hostilities, began, with, imperial, aggression, in, italy, once, finally, declared, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, lasted, almost, until, louis, s, death, at, great, cost, to, him, and, france, the, war, began, with, french, successes, but, the, talents, of, john, churchill, 1st, duke, of, marlborough, and, eugene, of, savoy, checked, these, victories, and, broke, the, myth, of, french, invincibility, the, duo, allowed, the, palatinate, and, austria, to, occupy, bavaria, after, their, victory, at, the, battle, of, blenheim, maximilian, ii, emanuel, elector, of, bavaria, had, to, flee, to, the, spanish, netherlands, the, impact, of, this, victory, won, the, support, of, portugal, and, savoy, later, the, battle, of, ramillies, delivered, the, low, countries, to, the, allies, and, the, battle, of, turin, forced, louis, to, evacuate, italy, leaving, it, open, to, allied, forces, marlborough, and, eugene, met, again, at, the, battle, of, oudenarde, which, enabled, them, to, invade, france, france, established, contact, with, francis, ii, r, k, czi, and, promised, support, if, he, took, up, the, cause, of, hungarian, independence, defeats, famine, and, mounting, debt, greatly, weakened, france, between, 1693, and, 1710, over, two, million, people, died, in, two, famines, made, worse, as, foraging, armies, seized, food, supplies, from, the, villages, in, desperation, louis, ordered, a, disastrous, invasion, of, the, english, island, of, guernsey, in, the, autumn, of, 1704, with, the, aim, of, raiding, their, successful, harvest, by, the, winter, of, 1708, 09, he, was, willing, to, accept, peace, at, nearly, any, cost, he, agreed, that, the, entire, spanish, empire, should, be, surrendered, to, archduke, charles, and, also, consented, to, return, to, the, frontiers, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, giving, up, all, the, territories, he, had, acquired, over, 60, years, but, he, could, not, promise, that, philip, v, would, accept, these, terms, so, the, allies, demanded, that, louis, single, handedly, attack, his, grandson, to, force, these, terms, on, him, if, he, could, not, achieve, this, within, the, year, the, war, would, resume, louis, would, not, accept, these, terms, the, final, phases, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, demonstrated, that, the, allies, could, not, maintain, archduke, charles, in, spain, just, as, surely, as, france, could, not, retain, the, entire, spanish, inheritance, for, philip, v, the, allies, were, definitively, expelled, from, central, spain, by, the, franco, spanish, victories, at, the, battles, of, villaviciosa, and, brihuega, in, 1710, french, forces, elsewhere, remained, obdurate, despite, their, defeats, the, allies, suffered, a, pyrrhic, victory, at, the, battle, of, malplaquet, with, 21, 000, casualties, twice, that, of, the, french, eventually, france, recovered, its, military, pride, with, the, decisive, victory, at, denain, in, 1712, french, military, successes, near, the, end, of, the, war, took, place, against, the, background, of, a, changed, political, situation, in, austria, in, 1705, emperor, leopold, i, died, his, elder, son, and, successor, joseph, i, followed, him, in, 1711, his, heir, was, none, other, than, archduke, charles, who, secured, control, of, all, of, his, brother, s, austrian, landholdings, if, the, spanish, empire, then, fell, to, him, it, would, have, resurrected, a, domain, as, vast, as, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, s, in, the, 16th, century, to, the, maritime, powers, of, great, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, this, would, have, been, as, undesirable, as, a, franco, spanish, union, as, a, result, of, the, fresh, british, perspective, on, the, european, balance, of, power, anglo, french, talks, began, culminating, in, the, 1713, peace, of, utrecht, between, louis, philip, v, of, spain, anne, of, great, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, in, 1714, after, losing, landau, and, freiburg, the, holy, roman, emperor, also, made, peace, with, france, in, the, treaties, of, rastatt, and, baden, in, the, general, settlement, philip, v, retained, spain, and, its, colonies, while, austria, received, the, spanish, netherlands, and, divided, spanish, italy, with, savoy, britain, kept, gibraltar, and, menorca, louis, agreed, to, withdraw, his, support, for, james, stuart, son, of, james, ii, and, pretender, to, the, thrones, of, great, britain, and, ireland, and, ceded, newfoundland, rupert, s, land, and, acadia, in, the, americas, to, anne, britain, gained, the, most, from, the, treaty, but, the, final, terms, were, much, more, favourable, to, france, than, those, being, discussed, in, peace, negotiations, in, 1709, and, 1710, france, retained, le, saint, jean, and, le, royale, and, louis, acquired, a, few, minor, european, territories, such, as, the, principality, of, orange, and, the, ubaye, valley, which, covered, transalpine, passes, into, italy, thanks, to, louis, his, allies, the, electors, of, bavaria, and, cologne, were, restored, to, their, prewar, status, and, returned, their, lands, louis, and, his, wife, maria, theresa, of, spain, had, six, children, from, the, marriage, contracted, for, them, in, 1660, however, only, one, child, the, eldest, survived, to, adulthood, louis, le, grand, dauphin, known, as, monseigneur, maria, theresa, died, in, 1683, whereupon, louis, remarked, that, she, had, never, caused, him, unease, on, any, other, occasion, despite, evidence, of, affection, early, on, in, their, marriage, louis, was, never, faithful, to, maria, theresa, he, took, a, series, of, mistresses, both, official, and, unofficial, among, the, better, documented, are, louise, de, la, valli, re, with, whom, he, had, five, children, 1661, 1667, bonne, de, pons, d, heudicourt, 1665, catherine, charlotte, de, gramont, 1665, fran, oise, ath, na, s, marquise, de, montespan, with, whom, he, had, seven, children, 1667, 1680, anne, de, rohan, chabot, 1669, 1675, claude, de, vin, des, illets, one, child, born, in, 1676, isabelle, de, ludres, 1675, 1678, and, marie, ang, lique, de, scorailles, 1679, 1681, who, died, at, age, 19, in, childbirth, through, these, liaisons, he, produced, numerous, illegitimate, children, most, of, whom, he, married, to, members, of, cadet, branches, of, the, royal, family, louis, proved, relatively, more, faithful, to, his, second, wife, fran, oise, d, aubign, marquise, de, maintenon, he, first, met, her, through, her, work, caring, for, his, children, by, madame, de, montespan, noting, the, care, she, gave, to, his, favourite, louis, auguste, duke, of, maine, the, king, was, at, first, put, off, by, her, strict, religious, practice, but, he, warmed, to, her, through, her, care, for, his, children, when, he, legitimized, his, children, by, madame, de, montespan, on, 20, december, 1673, fran, oise, d, aubign, became, the, royal, governess, at, saint, germain, as, governess, she, was, one, of, very, few, people, permitted, to, speak, to, him, as, an, equal, without, limits, it, is, believed, that, they, were, married, secretly, at, versailles, on, or, around, 10, october, 1683, or, january, 1684, this, marriage, though, never, announced, or, publicly, discussed, was, an, open, secret, and, lasted, until, his, death, louis, was, a, pious, and, devout, king, who, saw, himself, as, the, head, and, protector, of, the, catholic, church, in, france, he, made, his, devotions, daily, regardless, of, where, he, was, following, the, liturgical, calendar, regularly, under, the, influence, of, his, very, religious, second, wife, he, became, much, stronger, in, the, practice, of, his, catholic, faith, this, included, banning, opera, and, comedy, performances, during, lent, towards, the, middle, and, the, end, of, his, reign, the, centre, for, the, king, s, religious, observances, was, usually, the, chapelle, royale, at, versailles, ostentation, was, a, distinguishing, feature, of, daily, mass, annual, celebrations, such, as, those, of, holy, week, and, special, ceremonies, louis, established, the, paris, foreign, missions, society, but, his, informal, alliance, with, the, ottoman, empire, was, criticised, for, undermining, christendom, louis, generously, supported, the, royal, court, of, france, and, those, who, worked, under, him, he, brought, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, under, his, patronage, and, became, its, protector, he, allowed, classical, french, literature, to, flourish, by, protecting, such, writers, as, moli, re, racine, and, la, fontaine, whose, works, remain, influential, to, this, day, louis, also, patronised, the, visual, arts, by, funding, and, commissioning, artists, such, as, charles, le, brun, pierre, mignard, antoine, coysevox, and, hyacinthe, rigaud, whose, works, became, famous, throughout, europe, composers, and, musicians, such, as, jean, baptiste, lully, jacques, champion, de, chambonni, res, and, fran, ois, couperin, thrived, in, 1661, louis, founded, the, acad, mie, royale, de, danse, and, in, 1669, the, acad, mie, d, op, ra, important, driving, events, in, the, evolution, of, ballet, he, also, attracted, supported, and, patronized, such, artists, as, andr, charles, boulle, who, revolutionised, marquetry, with, his, art, of, inlay, today, known, as, boulle, work, always, on, the, lookout, for, new, talent, the, king, launched, music, competitions, in, 1683, michel, richard, de, lalande, thus, became, deputy, master, of, the, royal, chapel, composing, his, symphonies, for, the, soupers, du, roy, along, with, 77, large, scale, grand, motets, over, the, course, of, four, building, campaigns, louis, converted, a, hunting, lodge, built, by, louis, xiii, into, the, spectacular, palace, of, versailles, except, for, the, current, royal, chapel, built, near, the, end, of, his, reign, the, palace, achieved, much, of, its, current, appearance, after, the, third, building, campaign, which, was, followed, by, an, official, move, of, the, royal, court, to, versailles, on, 6, may, 1682, versailles, became, a, dazzling, awe, inspiring, setting, for, state, affairs, and, the, reception, of, foreign, dignitaries, at, versailles, the, king, alone, commanded, attention, several, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, the, creation, of, the, extravagant, and, stately, palace, as, well, as, the, relocation, of, the, monarchy, s, seat, the, memoirist, saint, simon, speculated, that, louis, viewed, versailles, as, an, isolated, power, centre, where, treasonous, cabals, could, be, more, readily, discovered, and, foiled, there, has, also, been, speculation, that, the, revolt, of, the, fronde, caused, louis, to, hate, paris, which, he, abandoned, for, a, country, retreat, but, his, sponsorship, of, many, public, works, in, paris, such, as, the, establishment, of, a, police, force, and, of, street, lighting, lend, little, credence, to, this, theory, as, a, further, example, of, his, continued, care, for, the, capital, louis, constructed, the, h, tel, des, invalides, a, military, complex, and, home, to, this, day, for, officers, and, soldiers, rendered, infirm, either, by, injury, or, old, age, while, pharmacology, was, still, quite, rudimentary, in, his, day, the, invalides, pioneered, new, treatments, and, set, new, standards, for, hospice, treatment, the, conclusion, of, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1668, also, induced, louis, to, demolish, paris, s, northern, walls, in, 1670, and, replace, them, with, wide, tree, lined, boulevards, louis, also, renovated, and, improved, the, louvre, and, other, royal, residences, gian, lorenzo, bernini, was, originally, to, plan, additions, to, the, louvre, however, his, plans, would, have, meant, the, destruction, of, much, of, the, existing, structure, replacing, it, with, an, italian, summer, villa, in, the, centre, of, paris, bernini, s, plans, were, eventually, shelved, in, favour, of, the, elegant, louvre, colonnade, designed, by, three, frenchmen, louis, le, vau, charles, le, brun, and, claude, perrault, with, the, relocation, of, the, court, to, versailles, the, louvre, was, given, over, to, the, arts, and, the, public, during, his, visit, from, rome, bernini, also, executed, a, renowned, portrait, bust, of, the, king, few, rulers, in, world, history, have, commemorated, themselves, in, as, grand, a, manner, as, louis, he, cultivated, his, image, as, the, sun, king, le, roi, soleil, the, centre, of, the, universe, without, equal, louis, used, court, ritual, and, the, arts, to, validate, and, augment, his, control, over, france, with, his, support, colbert, established, from, the, beginning, of, louis, s, personal, reign, a, centralised, and, institutionalised, system, for, creating, and, perpetuating, the, royal, image, the, king, was, thus, portrayed, largely, in, majesty, or, at, war, notably, against, spain, this, portrayal, of, the, monarch, was, to, be, found, in, numerous, media, of, artistic, expression, such, as, painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and, the, almanacs, that, diffused, royal, propaganda, to, the, population, at, large, over, his, lifetime, louis, commissioned, numerous, works, of, art, to, portray, himself, among, them, over, 300, formal, portraits, the, earliest, portrayals, of, louis, already, followed, the, pictorial, conventions, of, the, day, in, depicting, the, child, king, as, the, majestically, royal, incarnation, of, france, this, idealisation, of, the, monarch, continued, in, later, works, which, avoided, depictions, of, the, effect, of, smallpox, that, louis, contracted, in, 1647, in, the, 1660s, louis, began, to, be, shown, as, a, roman, emperor, the, god, apollo, or, alexander, the, great, as, can, be, seen, in, many, works, of, charles, le, brun, such, as, sculpture, paintings, and, the, decor, of, major, monuments, the, depiction, of, the, king, in, this, manner, focused, on, allegorical, or, mythological, attributes, instead, of, attempting, to, produce, a, true, likeness, as, louis, aged, so, too, did, the, manner, in, which, he, was, depicted, nonetheless, there, was, still, a, disparity, between, realistic, representation, and, the, demands, of, royal, propaganda, there, is, no, better, illustration, of, this, than, in, hyacinthe, rigaud, s, frequently, reproduced, portrait, of, louis, xiv, of, 1701, in, which, a, 63, year, old, louis, appears, to, stand, on, a, set, of, unnaturally, young, legs, rigaud, s, portrait, exemplified, the, height, of, royal, portraiture, during, louis, s, reign, although, rigaud, crafted, a, credible, likeness, of, louis, the, portrait, was, neither, meant, as, an, exercise, in, realism, nor, to, explore, louis, s, character, certainly, rigaud, was, concerned, with, detail, and, depicted, the, king, s, costume, with, great, precision, down, to, his, shoe, buckle, however, rigaud, intended, to, glorify, the, monarchy, rigaud, s, original, now, housed, in, the, louvre, was, originally, meant, as, a, gift, to, louis, s, grandson, philip, v, of, spain, however, louis, was, so, pleased, with, the, work, that, he, kept, the, original, and, commissioned, a, copy, to, be, sent, to, his, grandson, that, became, the, first, of, many, copies, both, in, full, and, half, length, formats, to, be, made, by, rigaud, often, with, the, help, of, his, assistants, the, portrait, also, became, a, model, for, french, royal, and, imperial, portraiture, down, to, the, time, of, charles, x, over, a, century, later, in, his, work, rigaud, proclaims, louis, s, exalted, royal, status, through, his, elegant, stance, and, haughty, expression, the, royal, regalia, and, throne, rich, ceremonial, fleur, de, lys, robes, as, well, as, the, upright, column, in, the, background, which, together, with, the, draperies, serves, to, frame, this, image, of, majesty, in, addition, to, portraits, louis, commissioned, at, least, 20, statues, of, himself, in, the, 1680s, to, stand, in, paris, and, provincial, towns, as, physical, manifestations, of, his, rule, he, also, commissioned, war, artists, to, follow, him, on, campaigns, to, document, his, military, triumphs, to, remind, the, people, of, these, triumphs, louis, erected, permanent, triumphal, arches, in, paris, and, the, provinces, for, the, first, time, since, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, louis, s, reign, marked, the, birth, and, infancy, of, the, art, of, medallions, sixteenth, century, rulers, had, often, issued, medals, in, small, numbers, to, commemorate, the, major, events, of, their, reigns, louis, however, struck, more, than, 300, to, celebrate, the, story, of, the, king, in, bronze, that, were, enshrined, in, thousands, of, households, throughout, france, he, also, used, tapestries, as, a, medium, of, exalting, the, monarchy, tapestries, could, be, allegorical, depicting, the, elements, or, seasons, or, realist, portraying, royal, residences, or, historical, events, they, were, among, the, most, significant, means, to, spread, royal, propaganda, prior, to, the, construction, of, the, hall, of, mirrors, at, versailles, louis, loved, ballet, and, frequently, danced, in, court, ballets, during, the, early, half, of, his, reign, in, general, louis, was, an, eager, dancer, who, performed, 80, roles, in, 40, major, ballets, this, approaches, the, career, of, a, professional, ballet, dancer, his, choices, were, strategic, and, varied, he, danced, four, parts, in, three, of, moli, re, s, com, dies, ballets, which, are, plays, accompanied, by, music, and, dance, louis, played, an, egyptian, in, le, mariage, forc, in, 1664, a, moorish, gentleman, in, le, sicilien, in, 1667, and, both, neptune, and, apollo, in, les, amants, magnifiques, in, 1670, he, sometimes, danced, leading, roles, that, were, suitably, royal, or, godlike, such, as, neptune, apollo, or, the, sun, at, other, times, he, would, adopt, mundane, roles, before, appearing, at, the, end, in, the, lead, role, it, is, considered, that, at, all, times, he, provided, his, roles, with, sufficient, majesty, and, drew, the, limelight, with, his, flair, for, dancing, for, louis, ballet, may, not, have, merely, been, a, tool, for, manipulation, in, his, propaganda, machinery, the, sheer, number, of, performances, he, gave, as, well, as, the, diversity, of, roles, he, played, may, serve, to, indicate, a, deeper, understanding, and, interest, in, the, art, form, ballet, dancing, was, used, by, louis, as, a, political, tool, to, hold, power, over, his, state, he, integrated, ballet, deeply, into, court, social, functions, and, fixated, his, nobles, attention, on, upholding, standards, in, ballet, dancing, effectively, distracting, them, from, political, activities, in, 1661, the, royal, academy, of, dance, was, founded, by, louis, to, further, his, ambition, pierre, beauchamp, his, private, dance, instructor, was, ordered, by, louis, to, come, up, with, a, notation, system, to, record, ballet, performances, which, he, did, with, great, success, his, work, was, adopted, and, published, by, feuillet, in, 1700, as, choregraphie, this, major, development, in, ballet, played, an, important, role, in, promoting, french, culture, and, ballet, throughout, europe, during, louis, s, time, louis, greatly, emphasized, etiquettes, in, ballet, dancing, evidently, seen, in, la, belle, danse, the, french, noble, style, more, challenging, skills, were, required, to, perform, this, dance, with, movements, very, much, resembling, court, behaviours, as, a, way, to, remind, the, nobles, of, the, king, s, absolute, power, and, their, own, status, all, the, details, and, rules, were, compressed, in, five, positions, of, the, bodies, codified, by, beauchamp, besides, the, official, depiction, and, image, of, louis, his, subjects, also, followed, a, non, official, discourse, consisting, mainly, of, clandestine, publications, popular, songs, and, rumours, that, provided, an, alternative, interpretation, of, louis, and, his, government, they, often, focused, on, the, miseries, arising, from, poor, government, but, also, carried, the, hope, for, a, better, future, when, louis, escaped, the, malignant, influence, of, his, ministers, and, mistresses, and, took, the, government, into, his, own, hands, on, the, other, hand, petitions, addressed, either, directly, to, louis, or, to, his, ministers, exploited, the, traditional, imagery, and, language, of, monarchy, these, varying, interpretations, of, louis, abounded, in, self, contradictions, that, reflected, the, people, s, amalgamation, of, their, everyday, experiences, with, the, idea, of, monarchy, despite, the, image, of, a, healthy, and, virile, king, that, louis, sought, to, project, evidence, exists, to, suggest, that, his, health, was, not, very, good, he, had, many, ailments, for, example, symptoms, of, diabetes, as, confirmed, in, reports, of, suppurating, periostitis, in, 1678, dental, abscesses, in, 1696, along, with, recurring, boils, fainting, spells, gout, dizziness, hot, flushes, and, headaches, from, 1647, to, 1711, the, three, chief, physicians, to, the, king, antoine, vallot, antoine, d, aquin, and, guy, crescent, fagon, recorded, all, of, his, health, problems, in, the, journal, de, sant, du, roi, journal, of, the, king, s, health, a, daily, report, of, his, health, on, 18, november, 1686, louis, underwent, a, painful, operation, for, an, anal, fistula, that, was, performed, by, the, surgeon, charles, felix, de, tassy, who, prepared, a, specially, shaped, curved, scalpel, for, the, occasion, the, wound, took, more, than, two, months, to, heal, louis, died, of, gangrene, at, versailles, on, 1, september, 1715, four, days, before, his, 77th, birthday, after, 72, years, on, the, throne, enduring, much, pain, in, his, last, days, he, finally, yielded, up, his, soul, without, any, effort, like, a, candle, going, out, while, reciting, the, psalm, deus, in, adjutorium, me, festina, o, lord, make, haste, to, help, me, his, body, was, laid, to, rest, in, saint, denis, basilica, outside, paris, it, remained, there, undisturbed, for, about, 80, years, until, revolutionaries, exhumed, and, destroyed, all, of, the, remains, found, in, the, basilica, in, 1848, at, nuneham, house, a, piece, of, louis, s, mummified, heart, taken, from, his, tomb, and, kept, in, a, silver, locket, by, lord, harcourt, archbishop, of, york, was, shown, to, the, dean, of, westminster, william, buckland, who, ate, it, cardinal, armand, gaston, maximilien, de, rohan, gave, last, rites, confession, viaticum, and, unction, to, king, louis, xiv, louis, outlived, most, of, his, immediate, legitimate, family, his, last, surviving, legitimate, son, louis, dauphin, of, france, died, in, 1711, barely, a, year, later, the, duke, of, burgundy, the, eldest, of, the, dauphin, s, three, sons, and, then, heir, apparent, to, louis, followed, his, father, burgundy, s, elder, son, louis, duke, of, brittany, joined, them, a, few, weeks, later, thus, on, his, deathbed, louis, s, heir, apparent, was, his, five, year, old, great, grandson, louis, duke, of, anjou, burgundy, s, younger, son, louis, foresaw, an, underaged, successor, and, sought, to, restrict, the, power, of, his, nephew, philip, ii, duke, of, orl, ans, who, as, his, closest, surviving, legitimate, relative, in, france, would, probably, become, regent, to, the, prospective, louis, xv, accordingly, the, king, created, a, regency, council, as, louis, xiii, had, in, anticipation, of, louis, xiv, s, own, minority, with, some, power, vested, in, his, illegitimate, son, louis, auguste, de, bourbon, duke, of, maine, orl, ans, however, had, louis, s, will, annulled, by, the, parlement, of, paris, after, his, death, and, made, himself, sole, regent, he, stripped, maine, and, his, brother, louis, alexandre, count, of, toulouse, of, the, rank, of, prince, of, the, blood, which, louis, had, granted, them, and, significantly, reduced, maine, s, power, and, privileges, line, of, succession, to, the, french, throne, upon, the, death, of, louis, xiv, in, 1715, louis, xiv, s, only, surviving, legitimate, grandson, philip, v, was, not, included, in, the, line, of, succession, due, to, having, renounced, the, french, throne, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, which, lasted, for, 13, years, after, the, death, of, charles, ii, of, spain, in, 1700, further, down, the, french, line, of, succession, in, 1715, was, the, house, of, cond, followed, by, the, house, of, conti, a, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, cond, both, of, these, royal, houses, were, descended, in, the, male, line, from, henri, ii, prince, of, cond, a, second, cousin, of, french, king, louis, xiii, the, father, of, louis, xiv, in, the, male, line, according, to, philippe, de, courcillon, s, journal, louis, on, his, deathbed, advised, his, heir, with, these, words, do, not, follow, the, bad, example, which, i, have, set, you, i, have, often, undertaken, war, too, lightly, and, have, sustained, it, for, vanity, do, not, imitate, me, but, be, a, peaceful, prince, and, may, you, apply, yourself, principally, to, the, alleviation, of, the, burdens, of, your, subjects, some, historians, point, out, that, it, was, a, customary, demonstration, of, piety, in, those, days, to, exaggerate, one, s, sins, thus, they, do, not, place, much, emphasis, on, louis, s, deathbed, declarations, in, assessing, his, accomplishments, rather, they, focus, on, military, and, diplomatic, successes, such, as, how, he, placed, a, french, prince, on, the, spanish, throne, this, they, contend, ended, the, threat, of, an, aggressive, spain, that, historically, interfered, in, domestic, french, politics, these, historians, also, emphasise, the, effect, of, louis, s, wars, in, expanding, france, s, boundaries, and, creating, more, defensible, frontiers, that, preserved, france, from, invasion, until, the, revolution, arguably, louis, also, applied, himself, indirectly, to, the, alleviation, of, the, burdens, of, subjects, for, example, he, patronised, the, arts, encouraged, industry, fostered, trade, and, commerce, and, sponsored, the, founding, of, an, overseas, empire, moreover, the, significant, reduction, in, civil, wars, and, aristocratic, rebellions, during, his, reign, are, seen, by, these, historians, as, the, result, of, louis, s, consolidation, of, royal, authority, over, feudal, elites, in, their, analysis, his, early, reforms, centralised, france, and, marked, the, birth, of, the, modern, french, state, they, regard, the, political, and, military, victories, as, well, as, numerous, cultural, achievements, as, how, louis, helped, raise, france, to, a, preeminent, position, in, europe, europe, came, to, admire, france, for, its, military, and, cultural, successes, power, and, sophistication, europeans, generally, began, to, emulate, french, manners, values, goods, and, deportment, french, became, the, universal, language, of, the, european, elite, louis, s, detractors, have, argued, that, his, considerable, foreign, military, and, domestic, expenditure, impoverished, and, bankrupted, france, his, supporters, however, distinguish, the, state, which, was, impoverished, from, france, which, was, not, as, supporting, evidence, they, cite, the, literature, of, the, time, such, as, the, social, commentary, in, montesquieu, s, persian, letters, alternatively, louis, s, critics, attribute, the, social, upheaval, culminating, in, the, french, revolution, to, his, failure, to, reform, french, institutions, while, the, monarchy, was, still, secure, other, scholars, counter, that, there, was, little, reason, to, reform, institutions, that, largely, worked, well, under, louis, they, also, maintain, that, events, occurring, almost, 80, years, after, his, death, were, not, reasonably, foreseeable, to, louis, and, that, in, any, case, his, successors, had, sufficient, time, to, initiate, reforms, of, their, own, louis, has, often, been, criticised, for, his, vanity, the, memoirist, saint, simon, who, claimed, that, louis, slighted, him, criticised, him, thus, there, was, nothing, he, liked, so, much, as, flattery, or, to, put, it, more, plainly, adulation, the, coarser, and, clumsier, it, was, the, more, he, relished, it, for, his, part, voltaire, saw, louis, s, vanity, as, the, cause, for, his, bellicosity, it, is, certain, that, he, passionately, wanted, glory, rather, than, the, conquests, themselves, in, the, acquisition, of, alsace, and, half, of, flanders, and, of, all, of, franche, comt, what, he, really, liked, was, the, name, he, made, for, himself, nonetheless, louis, has, also, received, praise, the, anti, bourbon, napoleon, described, him, not, only, as, a, great, king, but, also, as, the, only, king, of, france, worthy, of, the, name, leibniz, the, german, protestant, philosopher, commended, him, as, one, of, the, greatest, kings, that, ever, was, and, lord, acton, admired, him, as, by, far, the, ablest, man, who, was, born, in, modern, times, on, the, steps, of, a, throne, the, historian, and, philosopher, voltaire, wrote, his, name, can, never, be, pronounced, without, respect, and, without, summoning, the, image, of, an, eternally, memorable, age, voltaire, s, history, the, age, of, louis, xiv, named, louis, s, reign, as, not, only, one, of, the, four, great, ages, in, which, reason, and, culture, flourished, but, the, greatest, ever, numerous, quotes, have, been, attributed, to, louis, xiv, by, legend, the, well, known, i, am, the, state, l, tat, c, est, moi, was, reported, from, at, least, the, late, 18th, century, it, was, widely, repeated, but, also, denounced, as, apocryphal, by, the, early, 19th, century, he, did, say, every, time, i, appoint, someone, to, a, vacant, position, i, make, a, hundred, unhappy, and, one, ungrateful, louis, is, recorded, by, numerous, eyewitnesses, as, having, said, on, his, deathbed, je, m, en, vais, mais, l, tat, demeurera, toujours, i, depart, but, the, state, shall, always, remain, on, 5, april, 1693, louis, also, founded, the, royal, and, military, order, of, saint, louis, french, ordre, royal, et, militaire, de, saint, louis, a, military, order, of, chivalry, he, named, it, after, louis, ix, and, intended, it, as, a, reward, for, outstanding, officers, it, is, notable, as, the, first, decoration, that, could, be, granted, to, non, nobles, and, is, roughly, the, forerunner, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, with, which, it, shares, the, red, ribbon, though, the, l, gion, d, honneur, is, awarded, to, military, personnel, and, civilians, alike, louis, patriline, is, the, line, from, which, he, is, descended, from, father, to, son, patrilineal, descent, is, the, principle, behind, membership, in, royal, houses, as, it, can, be, traced, back, through, the, generations, which, means, that, if, king, louis, were, to, choose, a, historically, accurate, house, name, it, would, be, robertian, as, all, his, male, line, ancestors, have, been, of, that, house, louis, is, a, member, of, the, house, of, bourbon, a, branch, of, the, capetian, dynasty, and, of, the, robertians, louis, patriline, is, the, line, from, which, he, is, descended, from, father, to, son, it, follows, the, bourbon, kings, of, france, and, the, counts, of, paris, and, worms, this, line, can, be, traced, back, more, than, 1, 200, years, from, robert, of, hesbaye, to, the, present, day, through, kings, of, france, navarre, spain, and, two, sicilies, dukes, of, parma, and, grand, dukes, of, luxembourg, princes, of, orl, ans, and, emperors, of, brazil, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, in, europe, this, is, an, incomplete, list, of, louis, xiv, s, illegitimate, children, he, reputedly, had, more, but, the, difficulty, in, fully, documenting, all, such, births, restricts, the, list, only, to, the, better, known, and, or, legitimised
