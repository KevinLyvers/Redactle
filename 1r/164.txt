fran, ois, auguste, ren, rodin, r, o, d, n, french, 12, november, 1840, 17, november, 1917, was, a, french, sculptor, generally, considered, the, founder, of, modern, sculpture, he, was, schooled, traditionally, and, took, a, craftsman, like, approach, to, his, work, rodin, possessed, a, unique, ability, to, model, a, complex, turbulent, and, deeply, pocketed, surface, in, clay, he, is, known, for, such, sculptures, as, the, thinker, monument, to, balzac, the, kiss, the, burghers, of, calais, and, the, gates, of, hell, many, of, rodin, s, most, notable, sculptures, were, criticized, as, they, clashed, with, predominant, figurative, sculpture, traditions, in, which, works, were, decorative, formulaic, or, highly, thematic, rodin, s, most, original, work, departed, from, traditional, themes, of, mythology, and, allegory, he, modeled, the, human, body, with, naturalism, and, his, sculptures, celebrate, individual, character, and, physicality, although, rodin, was, sensitive, to, the, controversy, surrounding, his, work, he, refused, to, change, his, style, and, his, continued, output, brought, increasing, favor, from, the, government, and, the, artistic, community, from, the, unexpected, naturalism, of, rodin, s, first, major, figure, inspired, by, his, 1875, trip, to, italy, to, the, unconventional, memorials, whose, commissions, he, later, sought, his, reputation, grew, and, rodin, became, the, preeminent, french, sculptor, of, his, time, by, 1900, he, was, a, world, renowned, artist, wealthy, private, clients, sought, rodin, s, work, after, his, world, s, fair, exhibit, and, he, kept, company, with, a, variety, of, high, profile, intellectuals, and, artists, his, student, camille, claudel, became, his, associate, lover, and, creative, rival, rodin, s, other, students, included, antoine, bourdelle, constantin, br, ncu, i, and, charles, despiau, he, married, his, lifelong, companion, rose, beuret, in, the, last, year, of, both, their, lives, his, sculptures, suffered, a, decline, in, popularity, after, his, death, in, 1917, but, within, a, few, decades, his, legacy, solidified, rodin, remains, one, of, the, few, sculptors, widely, known, outside, the, visual, arts, community, rodin, was, born, in, 1840, into, a, working, class, family, in, paris, the, second, child, of, marie, cheffer, and, jean, baptiste, rodin, who, was, a, police, department, clerk, he, was, largely, self, educated, and, began, to, draw, at, age, 10, between, ages, 14, and, 17, he, attended, the, petite, cole, a, school, specializing, in, art, and, mathematics, where, he, studied, drawing, and, painting, his, drawing, teacher, horace, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, believed, in, first, developing, the, personality, of, his, students, so, that, they, observed, with, their, own, eyes, and, drew, from, their, recollections, and, rodin, expressed, appreciation, for, his, teacher, much, later, in, life, it, was, at, petite, cole, that, he, met, jules, dalou, and, alphonse, legros, in, 1857, rodin, submitted, a, clay, model, of, a, companion, to, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, an, attempt, to, win, entrance, he, did, not, succeed, and, two, further, applications, were, also, denied, entrance, requirements, were, not, particularly, high, at, the, grande, cole, so, the, rejections, were, considerable, setbacks, rodin, s, inability, to, gain, entrance, may, have, been, due, to, the, judges, neoclassical, tastes, while, rodin, had, been, schooled, in, light, 18th, century, sculpture, he, left, the, petite, cole, in, 1857, and, earned, a, living, as, a, craftsman, and, ornamenter, for, most, of, the, next, two, decades, producing, decorative, objects, and, architectural, embellishments, rodin, s, sister, maria, two, years, his, senior, died, of, peritonitis, in, a, convent, in, 1862, and, rodin, was, anguished, with, guilt, because, he, had, introduced, her, to, an, unfaithful, suitor, he, turned, away, from, art, and, joined, the, catholic, order, of, the, congregation, of, the, blessed, sacrament, as, a, laybrother, saint, peter, julian, eymard, founder, and, head, of, the, congregation, recognized, rodin, s, talent, and, sensed, his, lack, of, suitability, for, the, order, so, he, encouraged, rodin, to, continue, with, his, sculpture, rodin, returned, to, work, as, a, decorator, while, taking, classes, with, animal, sculptor, antoine, louis, barye, the, teacher, s, attention, to, detail, and, his, finely, rendered, musculature, of, animals, in, motion, significantly, influenced, rodin, in, 1864, rodin, began, to, live, with, a, young, seamstress, named, rose, beuret, born, in, june, 1844, with, whom, he, stayed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, with, varying, commitment, the, couple, had, a, son, named, auguste, eug, ne, beuret, 1866, 1934, that, year, rodin, offered, his, first, sculpture, for, exhibition, and, entered, the, studio, of, albert, ernest, carrier, belleuse, a, successful, mass, producer, of, objets, d, art, rodin, worked, as, carrier, belleuse, chief, assistant, until, 1870, designing, roof, decorations, and, staircase, and, doorway, embellishments, with, the, arrival, of, the, franco, prussian, war, rodin, was, called, to, serve, in, the, french, national, guard, but, his, service, was, brief, due, to, his, near, sightedness, decorators, work, had, dwindled, because, of, the, war, yet, rodin, needed, to, support, his, family, as, poverty, was, a, continual, difficulty, for, him, until, about, the, age, of, 30, carrier, belleuse, soon, asked, him, to, join, him, in, belgium, where, they, worked, on, ornamentation, for, the, brussels, stock, exchange, rodin, planned, to, stay, in, belgium, a, few, months, but, he, spent, the, next, six, years, outside, of, france, it, was, a, pivotal, time, in, his, life, he, had, acquired, skill, and, experience, as, a, craftsman, but, no, one, had, yet, seen, his, art, which, sat, in, his, workshop, since, he, could, not, afford, castings, his, relationship, with, carrier, belleuse, had, deteriorated, but, he, found, other, employment, in, brussels, displaying, some, works, at, salons, and, his, companion, rose, soon, joined, him, there, having, saved, enough, money, to, travel, rodin, visited, italy, for, two, months, in, 1875, where, he, was, drawn, to, the, work, of, donatello, and, michelangelo, their, work, had, a, profound, effect, on, his, artistic, direction, rodin, said, it, is, michelangelo, who, has, freed, me, from, academic, sculpture, returning, to, belgium, he, began, work, on, the, age, of, bronze, a, life, size, male, figure, whose, naturalism, brought, rodin, attention, but, led, to, accusations, of, sculptural, cheating, its, naturalism, and, scale, was, such, that, critics, alleged, he, had, cast, the, work, from, a, living, model, much, of, rodin, s, later, work, was, explicitly, larger, or, smaller, than, life, in, part, to, demonstrate, the, folly, of, such, accusations, rose, beuret, and, rodin, returned, to, paris, in, 1877, moving, into, a, small, flat, on, the, left, bank, misfortune, surrounded, rodin, his, mother, who, had, wanted, to, see, her, son, marry, was, dead, and, his, father, was, blind, and, senile, cared, for, by, rodin, s, sister, in, law, aunt, th, r, se, rodin, s, eleven, year, old, son, auguste, possibly, developmentally, delayed, was, also, in, the, ever, helpful, th, r, se, s, care, rodin, had, essentially, abandoned, his, son, for, six, years, and, would, have, a, very, limited, relationship, with, him, throughout, his, life, father, and, son, joined, the, couple, in, their, flat, with, rose, as, caretaker, charges, of, fakery, surrounding, the, age, of, bronze, continued, rodin, increasingly, sought, soothing, female, companionship, in, paris, and, rose, stayed, in, the, background, rodin, earned, his, living, collaborating, with, more, established, sculptors, on, public, commissions, primarily, memorials, and, neo, baroque, architectural, pieces, in, the, style, of, carpeaux, in, competitions, for, commissions, he, submitted, models, of, denis, diderot, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, lazare, carnot, all, to, no, avail, on, his, own, time, he, worked, on, studies, leading, to, the, creation, of, his, next, important, work, st, john, the, baptist, preaching, in, 1880, carrier, belleuse, then, art, director, of, the, s, vres, national, porcelain, factory, offered, rodin, a, part, time, position, as, a, designer, the, offer, was, in, part, a, gesture, of, reconciliation, and, rodin, accepted, that, part, of, rodin, which, appreciated, 18th, century, tastes, was, aroused, and, he, immersed, himself, in, designs, for, vases, and, table, ornaments, that, brought, the, factory, renown, across, europe, the, artistic, community, appreciated, his, work, in, this, vein, and, rodin, was, invited, to, paris, salons, by, such, friends, as, writer, l, on, cladel, during, his, early, appearances, at, these, social, events, rodin, seemed, shy, in, his, later, years, as, his, fame, grew, he, displayed, the, loquaciousness, and, temperament, for, which, he, is, better, known, french, statesman, leon, gambetta, expressed, a, desire, to, meet, rodin, and, the, sculptor, impressed, him, when, they, met, at, a, salon, gambetta, spoke, of, rodin, in, turn, to, several, government, ministers, likely, including, edmund, turquet, the, undersecretary, of, the, ministry, of, fine, arts, whom, rodin, eventually, met, rodin, s, relationship, with, turquet, was, rewarding, through, turquet, he, won, the, 1880, commission, to, create, a, portal, for, a, planned, museum, of, decorative, arts, rodin, dedicated, much, of, the, next, four, decades, to, his, elaborate, gates, of, hell, an, unfinished, portal, for, a, museum, that, was, never, built, many, of, the, portal, s, figures, became, sculptures, in, themselves, including, rodin, s, most, famous, the, thinker, and, the, kiss, with, the, museum, commission, came, a, free, studio, granting, rodin, a, new, level, of, artistic, freedom, soon, he, stopped, working, at, the, porcelain, factory, in, 1882, his, income, came, from, private, commissions, in, 1883, rodin, agreed, to, supervise, a, course, for, sculptor, alfred, boucher, in, his, absence, where, he, met, the, 18, year, old, camille, claudel, the, two, formed, a, passionate, but, stormy, relationship, and, influenced, each, other, artistically, claudel, inspired, rodin, as, a, model, for, many, of, his, figures, and, she, was, a, talented, sculptor, assisting, him, on, commissions, as, well, as, creating, her, own, works, her, bust, of, rodin, was, displayed, to, critical, acclaim, at, the, 1892, salon, although, busy, with, the, gates, of, hell, rodin, won, other, commissions, he, pursued, an, opportunity, to, create, a, historical, monument, for, the, town, of, calais, for, a, monument, to, french, author, honor, de, balzac, rodin, was, chosen, in, 1891, his, execution, of, both, sculptures, clashed, with, traditional, tastes, and, met, with, varying, degrees, of, disapproval, from, the, organizations, that, sponsored, the, commissions, still, rodin, was, gaining, support, from, diverse, sources, that, propelled, him, toward, fame, in, 1889, the, paris, salon, invited, rodin, to, be, a, judge, on, its, artistic, jury, though, rodin, s, career, was, on, the, rise, claudel, and, beuret, were, becoming, increasingly, impatient, with, rodin, s, double, life, claudel, and, rodin, shared, an, atelier, at, a, small, old, castle, the, ch, teau, de, l, islette, in, the, loire, but, rodin, refused, to, relinquish, his, ties, to, beuret, his, loyal, companion, during, the, lean, years, and, mother, of, his, son, during, one, absence, rodin, wrote, to, beuret, i, think, of, how, much, you, must, have, loved, me, to, put, up, with, my, caprices, i, remain, in, all, tenderness, your, rodin, claudel, and, rodin, parted, in, 1898, claudel, suffered, an, alleged, nervous, breakdown, several, years, later, and, was, confined, to, an, institution, for, 30, years, by, her, family, until, her, death, in, 1943, despite, numerous, attempts, by, doctors, to, explain, to, her, mother, and, brother, that, she, was, sane, in, 1904, rodin, was, introduced, to, the, welsh, artist, gwen, john, who, modelled, for, him, and, became, his, lover, after, being, introduced, by, hilda, flodin, john, had, a, fervent, attachment, to, rodin, and, would, write, to, him, thousands, of, times, over, the, next, ten, years, as, their, relationship, came, to, a, close, despite, his, genuine, feeling, for, her, rodin, eventually, resorted, to, the, use, of, conci, rges, and, secretaries, to, keep, her, at, a, distance, in, 1864, rodin, submitted, his, first, sculpture, for, exhibition, the, man, with, the, broken, nose, to, the, paris, salon, the, subject, was, an, elderly, neighborhood, street, porter, the, unconventional, bronze, piece, was, not, a, traditional, bust, but, instead, the, head, was, broken, off, at, the, neck, the, nose, was, flattened, and, crooked, and, the, back, of, the, head, was, absent, having, fallen, off, the, clay, model, in, an, accident, the, work, emphasized, texture, and, the, emotional, state, of, the, subject, it, illustrated, the, unfinishedness, that, would, characterize, many, of, rodin, s, later, sculptures, the, salon, rejected, the, piece, in, brussels, rodin, created, his, first, full, scale, work, the, age, of, bronze, having, returned, from, italy, modeled, after, a, belgian, soldier, the, figure, drew, inspiration, from, michelangelo, s, dying, slave, which, rodin, had, observed, at, the, louvre, attempting, to, combine, michelangelo, s, mastery, of, the, human, form, with, his, own, sense, of, human, nature, rodin, studied, his, model, from, all, angles, at, rest, and, in, motion, he, mounted, a, ladder, for, additional, perspective, and, made, clay, models, which, he, studied, by, candlelight, the, result, was, a, life, size, well, proportioned, nude, figure, posed, unconventionally, with, his, right, hand, atop, his, head, and, his, left, arm, held, out, at, his, side, forearm, parallel, to, the, body, in, 1877, the, work, debuted, in, brussels, and, then, was, shown, at, the, paris, salon, the, statue, s, apparent, lack, of, a, theme, was, troubling, to, critics, commemorating, neither, mythology, nor, a, noble, historical, event, and, it, is, not, clear, whether, rodin, intended, a, theme, he, first, titled, the, work, the, vanquished, in, which, form, the, left, hand, held, a, spear, but, he, removed, the, spear, because, it, obstructed, the, torso, from, certain, angles, after, two, more, intermediary, titles, rodin, settled, on, the, age, of, bronze, suggesting, the, bronze, age, and, in, rodin, s, words, man, arising, from, nature, later, however, rodin, said, that, he, had, had, in, mind, just, a, simple, piece, of, sculpture, without, reference, to, subject, its, mastery, of, form, light, and, shadow, made, the, work, look, so, naturalistic, that, rodin, was, accused, of, surmoulage, having, taken, a, cast, from, a, living, model, rodin, vigorously, denied, the, charges, writing, to, newspapers, and, having, photographs, taken, of, the, model, to, prove, how, the, sculpture, differed, he, demanded, an, inquiry, and, was, eventually, exonerated, by, a, committee, of, sculptors, leaving, aside, the, false, charges, the, piece, polarized, critics, it, had, barely, won, acceptance, for, display, at, the, paris, salon, and, criticism, likened, it, to, a, statue, of, a, sleepwalker, and, called, it, an, astonishingly, accurate, copy, of, a, low, type, others, rallied, to, defend, the, piece, and, rodin, s, integrity, the, government, minister, turquet, admired, the, piece, and, the, age, of, bronze, was, purchased, by, the, state, for, 2, 200, francs, what, it, had, cost, rodin, to, have, it, cast, in, bronze, a, second, male, nude, st, john, the, baptist, preaching, was, completed, in, 1878, rodin, sought, to, avoid, another, charge, of, surmoulage, by, making, the, statue, larger, than, life, st, john, stands, almost, 6, feet, 7, inches, 2, 01, m, while, the, age, of, bronze, is, statically, posed, st, john, gestures, and, seems, to, move, toward, the, viewer, the, effect, of, walking, is, achieved, despite, the, figure, having, both, feet, firmly, on, the, ground, a, technical, achievement, that, was, lost, on, most, contemporary, critics, rodin, chose, this, contradictory, position, to, in, his, words, display, simultaneously, views, of, an, object, which, in, fact, can, be, seen, only, successively, despite, the, title, st, john, the, baptist, preaching, did, not, have, an, obviously, religious, theme, the, model, an, italian, peasant, who, presented, himself, at, rodin, s, studio, possessed, an, idiosyncratic, sense, of, movement, that, rodin, felt, compelled, to, capture, rodin, thought, of, john, the, baptist, and, carried, that, association, into, the, title, of, the, work, in, 1880, rodin, submitted, the, sculpture, to, the, paris, salon, critics, were, still, mostly, dismissive, of, his, work, but, the, piece, finished, third, in, the, salon, s, sculpture, category, regardless, of, the, immediate, receptions, of, st, john, and, the, age, of, bronze, rodin, had, achieved, a, new, degree, of, fame, students, sought, him, at, his, studio, praising, his, work, and, scorning, the, charges, of, surmoulage, the, artistic, community, knew, his, name, a, commission, to, create, a, portal, for, paris, planned, museum, of, decorative, arts, was, awarded, to, rodin, in, 1880, although, the, museum, was, never, built, rodin, worked, throughout, his, life, on, the, gates, of, hell, a, monumental, sculptural, group, depicting, scenes, from, dante, s, inferno, in, high, relief, often, lacking, a, clear, conception, of, his, major, works, rodin, compensated, with, hard, work, and, a, striving, for, perfection, he, conceived, the, gates, with, the, surmoulage, controversy, still, in, mind, i, had, made, the, st, john, to, refute, but, it, only, partially, succeeded, to, prove, completely, that, i, could, model, from, life, as, well, as, other, sculptors, i, determined, to, make, the, sculpture, on, the, door, of, figures, smaller, than, life, laws, of, composition, gave, way, to, the, gates, disordered, and, untamed, depiction, of, hell, the, figures, and, groups, in, this, rodin, s, meditation, on, the, condition, of, man, are, physically, and, morally, isolated, in, their, torment, the, gates, of, hell, comprised, 186, figures, in, its, final, form, many, of, rodin, s, best, known, sculptures, started, as, designs, of, figures, for, this, composition, such, as, the, thinker, the, three, shades, and, the, kiss, and, were, only, later, presented, as, separate, and, independent, works, other, well, known, works, derived, from, the, gates, are, ugolino, fallen, caryatid, carrying, her, stone, fugit, amor, she, who, was, once, the, helmet, maker, s, beautiful, wife, the, falling, man, and, the, prodigal, son, the, thinker, originally, titled, the, poet, after, dante, was, to, become, one, of, the, best, known, sculptures, in, the, world, the, original, was, a, 27, 5, inch, 700, mm, high, bronze, piece, created, between, 1879, and, 1889, designed, for, the, gates, lintel, from, which, the, figure, would, gaze, down, upon, hell, while, the, thinker, most, obviously, characterizes, dante, aspects, of, the, biblical, adam, the, mythological, prometheus, and, rodin, himself, have, been, ascribed, to, him, other, observers, de, emphasize, the, apparent, intellectual, theme, of, the, thinker, stressing, the, figure, s, rough, physicality, and, the, emotional, tension, emanating, from, it, the, town, of, calais, had, contemplated, a, historical, monument, for, decades, when, rodin, learned, of, the, project, he, pursued, the, commission, interested, in, the, medieval, motif, and, patriotic, theme, the, mayor, of, calais, was, tempted, to, hire, rodin, on, the, spot, upon, visiting, his, studio, and, soon, the, memorial, was, approved, with, rodin, as, its, architect, it, would, commemorate, the, six, townspeople, of, calais, who, offered, their, lives, to, save, their, fellow, citizens, during, the, hundred, years, war, the, army, of, king, edward, iii, besieged, calais, and, edward, ordered, that, the, town, s, population, be, killed, en, masse, he, agreed, to, spare, them, if, six, of, the, principal, citizens, would, come, to, him, prepared, to, die, bareheaded, and, barefooted, and, with, ropes, around, their, necks, when, they, came, he, ordered, that, they, be, executed, but, pardoned, them, when, his, queen, philippa, of, hainault, begged, him, to, spare, their, lives, the, burghers, of, calais, depicts, the, men, as, they, are, leaving, for, the, king, s, camp, carrying, keys, to, the, town, s, gates, and, citadel, rodin, began, the, project, in, 1884, inspired, by, the, chronicles, of, the, siege, by, jean, froissart, though, the, town, envisioned, an, allegorical, heroic, piece, centered, on, eustache, de, saint, pierre, the, eldest, of, the, six, men, rodin, conceived, the, sculpture, as, a, study, in, the, varied, and, complex, emotions, under, which, all, six, men, were, laboring, one, year, into, the, commission, the, calais, committee, was, not, impressed, with, rodin, s, progress, rodin, indicated, his, willingness, to, end, the, project, rather, than, change, his, design, to, meet, the, committee, s, conservative, expectations, but, calais, said, to, continue, in, 1889, the, burghers, of, calais, was, first, displayed, to, general, acclaim, it, is, a, bronze, sculpture, weighing, two, short, tons, 1, 814, kg, and, its, figures, are, 6, 6, ft, 2, 0, m, tall, the, six, men, portrayed, do, not, display, a, united, heroic, front, rather, each, is, isolated, from, his, brothers, individually, deliberating, and, struggling, with, his, expected, fate, rodin, soon, proposed, that, the, monument, s, high, pedestal, be, eliminated, wanting, to, move, the, sculpture, to, ground, level, so, that, viewers, could, penetrate, to, the, heart, of, the, subject, at, ground, level, the, figures, positions, lead, the, viewer, around, the, work, and, subtly, suggest, their, common, movement, forward, the, committee, was, incensed, by, the, untraditional, proposal, but, rodin, would, not, yield, in, 1895, calais, succeeded, in, having, burghers, displayed, in, their, preferred, form, the, work, was, placed, in, front, of, a, public, garden, on, a, high, platform, surrounded, by, a, cast, iron, railing, rodin, had, wanted, it, located, near, the, town, hall, where, it, would, engage, the, public, only, after, damage, during, the, first, world, war, subsequent, storage, and, rodin, s, death, was, the, sculpture, displayed, as, he, had, intended, it, is, one, of, rodin, s, best, known, and, most, acclaimed, works, commissioned, to, create, a, monument, to, french, writer, victor, hugo, in, 1889, rodin, dealt, extensively, with, the, subject, of, artist, and, muse, like, many, of, rodin, s, public, commissions, monument, to, victor, hugo, was, met, with, resistance, because, it, did, not, fit, conventional, expectations, commenting, on, rodin, s, monument, to, victor, hugo, the, times, in, 1909, expressed, that, there, is, some, show, of, reason, in, the, complaint, that, conceptions, are, sometimes, unsuited, to, his, medium, and, that, in, such, cases, they, overstrain, his, vast, technical, powers, the, 1897, plaster, model, was, not, cast, in, bronze, until, 1964, the, soci, t, des, gens, des, lettres, a, parisian, organization, of, writers, planned, a, monument, to, french, novelist, honor, de, balzac, immediately, after, his, death, in, 1850, the, society, commissioned, rodin, to, create, the, memorial, in, 1891, and, rodin, spent, years, developing, the, concept, for, his, sculpture, challenged, in, finding, an, appropriate, representation, of, balzac, given, the, author, s, rotund, physique, rodin, produced, many, studies, portraits, full, length, figures, in, the, nude, wearing, a, frock, coat, or, in, a, robe, a, replica, of, which, rodin, had, requested, the, realized, sculpture, displays, balzac, cloaked, in, the, drapery, looking, forcefully, into, the, distance, with, deeply, gouged, features, rodin, s, intent, had, been, to, show, balzac, at, the, moment, of, conceiving, a, work, to, express, courage, labor, and, struggle, when, monument, to, balzac, was, exhibited, in, 1898, the, negative, reaction, was, not, surprising, the, soci, t, rejected, the, work, and, the, press, ran, parodies, criticizing, the, work, morey, 1918, reflected, there, may, come, a, time, and, doubtless, will, come, a, time, when, it, will, not, seem, outre, to, represent, a, great, novelist, as, a, huge, comic, mask, crowning, a, bathrobe, but, even, at, the, present, day, this, statue, impresses, one, as, slang, a, modern, critic, indeed, claims, that, balzac, is, one, of, rodin, s, masterpieces, the, monument, had, its, supporters, in, rodin, s, day, a, manifesto, defending, him, was, signed, by, monet, debussy, and, future, premier, georges, clemenceau, among, many, others, in, the, bbc, series, civilisation, art, historian, kenneth, clark, praised, the, monument, as, the, greatest, piece, of, sculpture, of, the, 19th, century, perhaps, indeed, the, greatest, since, michelangelo, rather, than, try, to, convince, skeptics, of, the, merit, of, the, monument, rodin, repaid, the, soci, t, his, commission, and, moved, the, figure, to, his, garden, after, this, experience, rodin, did, not, complete, another, public, commission, only, in, 1939, was, monument, to, balzac, cast, in, bronze, and, placed, on, the, boulevard, du, montparnasse, at, the, intersection, with, boulevard, raspail, the, popularity, of, rodin, s, most, famous, sculptures, tends, to, obscure, his, total, creative, output, a, prolific, artist, he, created, thousands, of, busts, figures, and, sculptural, fragments, over, more, than, five, decades, he, painted, in, oils, especially, in, his, thirties, and, in, watercolors, the, mus, e, rodin, holds, 7, 000, of, his, drawings, and, prints, in, chalk, and, charcoal, and, thirteen, vigorous, drypoints, he, also, produced, a, single, lithograph, portraiture, was, an, important, component, of, rodin, s, oeuvre, helping, him, to, win, acceptance, and, financial, independence, his, first, sculpture, was, a, bust, of, his, father, in, 1860, and, he, produced, at, least, 56, portraits, between, 1877, and, his, death, in, 1917, early, subjects, included, fellow, sculptor, jules, dalou, 1883, and, companion, camille, claudel, 1884, later, with, his, reputation, established, rodin, made, busts, of, prominent, contemporaries, such, as, english, politician, george, wyndham, 1905, irish, playwright, george, bernard, shaw, 1906, socialist, and, former, mistress, of, the, prince, of, wales, who, became, king, edward, vii, countess, of, warwick, 1908, austrian, composer, gustav, mahler, 1909, former, argentine, president, domingo, faustino, sarmiento, and, french, statesman, georges, clemenceau, 1911, his, undated, drawing, study, of, a, woman, nude, standing, arms, raised, hands, crossed, above, head, is, one, of, the, works, seized, in, 2012, from, the, collection, of, cornelius, gurlitt, rodin, was, a, naturalist, less, concerned, with, monumental, expression, than, with, character, and, emotion, departing, with, centuries, of, tradition, he, turned, away, from, the, idealism, of, the, greeks, and, the, decorative, beauty, of, the, baroque, and, neo, baroque, movements, his, sculpture, emphasized, the, individual, and, the, concreteness, of, flesh, and, suggested, emotion, through, detailed, textured, surfaces, and, the, interplay, of, light, and, shadow, to, a, greater, degree, than, his, contemporaries, rodin, believed, that, an, individual, s, character, was, revealed, by, his, physical, features, rodin, s, talent, for, surface, modeling, allowed, him, to, let, every, part, of, the, body, speak, for, the, whole, the, male, s, passion, in, the, thinker, is, suggested, by, the, grip, of, his, toes, on, the, rock, the, rigidness, of, his, back, and, the, differentiation, of, his, hands, speaking, of, the, thinker, rodin, illuminated, his, aesthetic, what, makes, my, thinker, think, is, that, he, thinks, not, only, with, his, brain, with, his, knitted, brow, his, distended, nostrils, and, compressed, lips, but, with, every, muscle, of, his, arms, back, and, legs, with, his, clenched, fist, and, gripping, toes, sculptural, fragments, to, rodin, were, autonomous, works, and, he, considered, them, the, essence, of, his, artistic, statement, his, fragments, perhaps, lacking, arms, legs, or, a, head, took, sculpture, further, from, its, traditional, role, of, portraying, likenesses, and, into, a, realm, where, forms, existed, for, their, own, sake, notable, examples, are, the, walking, man, meditation, without, arms, and, iris, messenger, of, the, gods, rodin, saw, suffering, and, conflict, as, hallmarks, of, modern, art, nothing, really, is, more, moving, than, the, maddened, beast, dying, from, unfulfilled, desire, and, asking, in, vain, for, grace, to, quell, its, passion, charles, baudelaire, echoed, those, themes, and, was, among, rodin, s, favorite, poets, rodin, enjoyed, music, especially, the, opera, composer, gluck, and, wrote, a, book, about, french, cathedrals, he, owned, a, work, by, the, as, yet, unrecognized, van, gogh, and, admired, the, forgotten, el, greco, instead, of, copying, traditional, academic, postures, rodin, preferred, his, models, to, move, naturally, around, his, studio, despite, their, nakedness, the, sculptor, often, made, quick, sketches, in, clay, that, were, later, fine, tuned, cast, in, plaster, and, cast, in, bronze, or, carved, from, marble, rodin, s, focus, was, on, the, handling, of, clay, george, bernard, shaw, sat, for, a, portrait, and, gave, an, idea, of, rodin, s, technique, while, he, worked, he, achieved, a, number, of, miracles, at, the, end, of, the, first, fifteen, minutes, after, having, given, a, simple, idea, of, the, human, form, to, the, block, of, clay, he, produced, by, the, action, of, his, thumb, a, bust, so, living, that, i, would, have, taken, it, away, with, me, to, relieve, the, sculptor, of, any, further, work, he, described, the, evolution, of, his, bust, over, a, month, passing, through, all, the, stages, of, art, s, evolution, first, a, byzantine, masterpiece, then, bernini, intermingled, then, an, elegant, houdon, the, hand, of, rodin, worked, not, as, the, hand, of, a, sculptor, works, but, as, the, work, of, elan, vital, the, hand, of, god, is, his, own, hand, after, he, completed, his, work, in, clay, he, employed, highly, skilled, assistants, to, re, sculpt, his, compositions, at, larger, sizes, including, any, of, his, large, scale, monuments, such, as, the, thinker, to, cast, the, clay, compositions, into, plaster, or, bronze, and, to, carve, his, marbles, rodin, s, major, innovation, was, to, capitalize, on, such, multi, staged, processes, of, 19th, century, sculpture, and, their, reliance, on, plaster, casting, since, clay, deteriorates, rapidly, if, not, kept, wet, or, fired, into, a, terra, cotta, sculptors, used, plaster, casts, as, a, means, of, securing, the, composition, they, would, make, from, the, fugitive, material, that, is, clay, this, was, common, practice, amongst, rodin, s, contemporaries, and, sculptors, would, exhibit, plaster, casts, with, the, hopes, that, they, would, be, commissioned, to, have, the, works, made, in, a, more, permanent, material, rodin, however, would, have, multiple, plasters, made, and, treat, them, as, the, raw, material, of, sculpture, recombining, their, parts, and, figures, into, new, compositions, and, new, names, as, rodin, s, practice, developed, into, the, 1890s, he, became, more, and, more, radical, in, his, pursuit, of, fragmentation, the, combination, of, figures, at, different, scales, and, the, making, of, new, compositions, from, his, earlier, work, a, prime, example, of, this, is, the, bold, the, walking, man, 1899, 1900, which, was, exhibited, at, his, major, one, person, show, in, 1900, this, is, composed, of, two, sculptures, from, the, 1870s, that, rodin, found, in, his, studio, a, broken, and, damaged, torso, that, had, fallen, into, neglect, and, the, lower, extremities, of, a, statuette, version, of, his, 1878, st, john, the, baptist, preaching, he, was, having, re, sculpted, at, a, reduced, scale, without, finessing, the, join, between, upper, and, lower, between, torso, and, legs, rodin, created, a, work, that, many, sculptors, at, the, time, and, subsequently, have, seen, as, one, of, his, strongest, and, most, singular, works, this, is, despite, the, fact, that, the, object, conveys, two, different, styles, exhibits, two, different, attitudes, toward, finish, and, lacks, any, attempt, to, hide, the, arbitrary, fusion, of, these, two, components, it, was, the, freedom, and, creativity, with, which, rodin, used, these, practices, along, with, his, activation, surfaces, of, sculptures, through, traces, of, his, own, touch, and, with, his, more, open, attitude, toward, bodily, pose, sensual, subject, matter, and, non, naturalistic, surface, that, marked, rodin, s, re, making, of, traditional, 19th, century, sculptural, techniques, into, the, prototype, for, modern, sculpture, by, 1900, rodin, s, artistic, reputation, was, established, gaining, exposure, from, a, pavilion, of, his, artwork, set, up, near, the, 1900, world, s, fair, exposition, universelle, in, paris, he, received, requests, to, make, busts, of, prominent, people, internationally, while, his, assistants, at, the, atelier, produced, duplicates, of, his, works, his, income, from, portrait, commissions, alone, totaled, probably, 200, 000, francs, a, year, as, rodin, s, fame, grew, he, attracted, many, followers, including, the, german, poet, rainer, maria, rilke, and, authors, octave, mirbeau, joris, karl, huysmans, and, oscar, wilde, rilke, stayed, with, rodin, in, 1905, and, 1906, and, did, administrative, work, for, him, he, would, later, write, a, laudatory, monograph, on, the, sculptor, rodin, and, beuret, s, modest, country, estate, in, meudon, purchased, in, 1897, was, a, host, to, such, guests, as, king, edward, dancer, isadora, duncan, and, harpsichordist, wanda, landowska, a, british, journalist, who, visited, the, property, noted, in, 1902, that, in, its, complete, isolation, there, was, a, striking, analogy, between, its, situation, and, the, personality, of, the, man, who, lives, in, it, rodin, moved, to, the, city, in, 1908, renting, the, main, floor, of, the, h, tel, biron, an, 18th, century, townhouse, he, left, beuret, in, meudon, and, began, an, affair, with, the, american, born, duchesse, de, choiseul, from, 1910, he, mentored, the, russian, sculptor, moissey, kogan, while, rodin, was, beginning, to, be, accepted, in, france, by, the, time, of, the, burghers, of, calais, he, had, not, yet, conquered, the, american, market, because, of, his, technique, and, the, frankness, of, some, of, his, work, he, did, not, have, an, easy, time, selling, his, work, to, american, industrialists, however, he, came, to, know, sarah, tyson, hallowell, 1846, 1924, a, curator, from, chicago, who, visited, paris, to, arrange, exhibitions, at, the, large, interstate, expositions, of, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, hallowell, was, not, only, a, curator, but, an, adviser, and, a, facilitator, who, was, trusted, by, a, number, of, prominent, american, collectors, to, suggest, works, for, their, collections, the, most, prominent, of, these, being, the, chicago, hotelier, potter, palmer, and, his, wife, bertha, palmer, 1849, 1918, the, next, opportunity, for, rodin, in, america, was, the, 1893, chicago, world, s, fair, hallowell, wanted, to, help, promote, rodin, s, work, and, he, suggested, a, solo, exhibition, which, she, wrote, him, was, beaucoup, moins, beau, que, l, original, but, impossible, outside, the, rules, instead, she, suggested, he, send, a, number, of, works, for, her, loan, exhibition, of, french, art, from, american, collections, and, she, told, him, she, would, list, them, as, being, part, of, an, american, collection, rodin, sent, hallowell, three, works, cupid, and, psyche, sphinx, and, andromeda, all, nudes, these, works, provoked, great, controversy, and, were, ultimately, hidden, behind, a, drape, with, special, permission, given, for, viewers, to, see, them, bust, of, dalou, and, burgher, of, calais, were, on, display, in, the, official, french, pavilion, at, the, fair, and, so, between, the, works, that, were, on, display, and, those, that, were, not, he, was, noticed, however, the, works, he, gave, hallowell, to, sell, found, no, takers, but, she, soon, brought, the, controversial, quaker, born, financier, charles, yerkes, 1837, 1905, into, the, fold, and, he, purchased, two, large, marbles, for, his, chicago, manse, yerkes, was, likely, the, first, american, to, own, a, rodin, sculpture, other, collectors, soon, followed, including, the, tastemaking, potter, palmers, of, chicago, and, isabella, stewart, gardner, 1840, 1924, of, boston, all, arranged, by, sarah, hallowell, in, appreciation, for, her, efforts, at, unlocking, the, american, market, rodin, eventually, presented, hallowell, with, a, bronze, a, marble, and, a, terra, cotta, when, hallowell, moved, to, paris, in, 1893, she, and, rodin, continued, their, warm, friendship, and, correspondence, which, lasted, to, the, end, of, the, sculptor, s, life, after, hallowell, s, death, her, niece, the, painter, harriet, hallowell, inherited, the, rodins, and, after, her, death, the, american, heirs, could, not, manage, to, match, their, value, in, order, to, export, them, so, they, became, the, property, of, the, french, state, after, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, rodin, was, a, regular, visitor, to, great, britain, where, he, developed, a, loyal, following, by, the, beginning, of, the, first, world, war, he, first, visited, england, in, 1881, where, his, friend, the, artist, alphonse, legros, had, introduced, him, to, the, poet, william, ernest, henley, with, his, personal, connections, and, enthusiasm, for, rodin, s, art, henley, was, most, responsible, for, rodin, s, reception, in, britain, rodin, later, returned, the, favor, by, sculpting, a, bust, of, henley, that, was, used, as, the, frontispiece, to, henley, s, collected, works, and, after, his, death, on, his, monument, in, london, through, henley, rodin, met, robert, louis, stevenson, and, robert, browning, in, whom, he, found, further, support, encouraged, by, the, enthusiasm, of, british, artists, students, and, high, society, for, his, art, rodin, donated, a, significant, selection, of, his, works, to, the, nation, in, 1914, after, the, revitalization, of, the, soci, t, nationale, des, beaux, arts, in, 1890, rodin, served, as, the, body, s, vice, president, in, 1903, rodin, was, elected, president, of, the, international, society, of, painters, sculptors, and, engravers, he, replaced, its, former, president, james, abbott, mcneill, whistler, upon, whistler, s, death, his, election, to, the, prestigious, position, was, largely, due, to, the, efforts, of, albert, ludovici, father, of, english, philosopher, anthony, ludovici, who, was, private, secretary, to, rodin, for, several, months, in, 1906, but, the, two, men, parted, company, after, christmas, to, their, mutual, relief, during, his, later, creative, years, rodin, s, work, turned, increasingly, toward, the, female, form, and, themes, of, more, overt, masculinity, and, femininity, he, concentrated, on, small, dance, studies, and, produced, numerous, erotic, drawings, sketched, in, a, loose, way, without, taking, his, pencil, from, the, paper, or, his, eyes, from, the, model, rodin, met, american, dancer, isadora, duncan, in, 1900, attempted, to, seduce, her, and, the, next, year, sketched, studies, of, her, and, her, students, in, july, 1906, rodin, was, also, enchanted, by, dancers, from, the, royal, ballet, of, cambodia, and, produced, some, of, his, most, famous, drawings, from, the, experience, fifty, three, years, into, their, relationship, rodin, married, rose, beuret, they, married, on, 29, january, 1917, and, beuret, died, two, weeks, later, on, 16, february, rodin, was, ill, that, year, in, january, he, suffered, weakness, from, influenza, and, on, 16, november, his, physician, announced, that, congestion, of, the, lungs, has, caused, great, weakness, the, patient, s, condition, is, grave, rodin, died, the, next, day, age, 77, at, his, villa, in, meudon, le, de, france, on, the, outskirts, of, paris, a, cast, of, the, thinker, was, placed, next, to, his, tomb, in, meudon, it, was, rodin, s, wish, that, the, figure, served, as, his, headstone, and, epitaph, in, 1923, marcell, tirel, rodin, s, secretary, published, a, book, alleging, that, rodin, s, death, was, largely, due, to, cold, and, the, fact, that, he, had, no, heat, at, meudon, rodin, requested, permission, to, stay, in, the, hotel, biron, a, museum, of, his, works, but, the, director, of, the, museum, refused, to, let, him, stay, there, rodin, willed, to, the, french, state, his, studio, and, the, right, to, make, casts, from, his, plasters, because, he, encouraged, the, edition, of, his, sculpted, work, rodin, s, sculptures, are, represented, in, many, public, and, private, collections, the, mus, e, rodin, was, founded, in, 1916, and, opened, in, 1919, at, the, h, tel, biron, where, rodin, had, lived, and, it, holds, the, largest, rodin, collection, with, more, than, 6, 000, sculptures, and, 7, 000, works, on, paper, the, french, order, l, gion, d, honneur, made, him, a, commander, and, he, received, an, honorary, doctorate, from, the, university, of, oxford, during, his, lifetime, rodin, was, compared, to, michelangelo, and, was, widely, recognized, as, the, greatest, artist, of, the, era, in, the, three, decades, following, his, death, his, popularity, waned, with, changing, aesthetic, values, since, the, 1950s, rodin, s, reputation, has, re, ascended, he, is, recognized, as, the, most, important, sculptor, of, the, modern, era, and, has, been, the, subject, of, much, scholarly, work, the, sense, of, incompletion, offered, by, some, of, his, sculpture, such, as, the, walking, man, influenced, the, increasingly, abstract, sculptural, forms, of, the, 20th, century, rodin, restored, an, ancient, role, of, sculpture, to, capture, the, physical, and, intellectual, force, of, the, human, subject, and, he, freed, sculpture, from, the, repetition, of, traditional, patterns, providing, the, foundation, for, greater, experimentation, in, the, 20th, century, his, popularity, is, ascribed, to, his, emotion, laden, representations, of, ordinary, men, and, women, to, his, ability, to, find, the, beauty, and, pathos, in, the, human, animal, his, most, popular, works, such, as, the, kiss, and, the, thinker, are, widely, used, outside, the, fine, arts, as, symbols, of, human, emotion, and, character, to, honor, rodin, s, artistic, legacy, the, google, search, engine, homepage, displayed, a, google, doodle, featuring, the, thinker, to, celebrate, his, 172nd, birthday, on, 12, november, 2012, rodin, had, enormous, artistic, influence, a, whole, generation, of, sculptors, studied, in, his, workshop, these, include, gutzon, borglum, antoine, bourdelle, constantin, br, ncu, i, camille, claudel, charles, despiau, malvina, hoffman, carl, milles, fran, ois, pompon, rodo, gustav, vigeland, clara, westhoff, and, margaret, winser, even, though, brancusi, later, rejected, his, legacy, rodin, also, promoted, the, work, of, other, sculptors, including, aristide, maillol, and, ivan, me, trovi, whom, rodin, once, called, the, greatest, phenomenon, amongst, sculptors, other, sculptors, whose, work, has, been, described, as, owing, to, rodin, include, joseph, csaky, alexander, archipenko, joseph, bernard, henri, gaudier, brzeska, georg, kolbe, wilhelm, lehmbruck, jacques, lipchitz, pablo, picasso, adolfo, wildt, and, ossip, zadkine, henry, moore, acknowledged, rodin, s, seminal, influence, on, his, work, several, films, have, been, made, featuring, rodin, as, a, prominent, character, or, presence, these, include, camille, claudel, a, 1988, film, in, which, g, rard, depardieu, portrays, rodin, camille, claudel, 1915, from, 2013, and, rodin, a, 2017, film, starring, vincent, lindon, as, rodin, furthermore, the, rodin, studios, artists, cooperative, housing, in, new, york, city, completed, in, 1917, to, designs, by, cass, gilbert, was, named, after, rodin, the, relative, ease, of, making, reproductions, has, also, encouraged, many, forgeries, a, survey, of, expert, opinion, placed, rodin, in, the, top, ten, most, faked, artists, rodin, fought, against, forgeries, of, his, works, as, early, as, 1901, and, since, his, death, many, cases, of, organized, large, scale, forgeries, have, been, revealed, a, massive, forgery, was, discovered, by, french, authorities, in, the, early, 1990s, and, led, to, the, conviction, of, art, dealer, guy, hain, to, deal, with, the, complexity, of, bronze, reproduction, france, has, promulgated, several, laws, since, 1956, which, limit, reproduction, to, twelve, casts, the, maximum, number, that, can, be, made, from, an, artist, s, plasters, and, still, be, considered, his, work, as, a, result, of, this, limit, the, burghers, of, calais, for, example, is, found, in, fourteen, cities, in, the, market, for, sculpture, plagued, by, fakes, the, value, of, a, piece, increases, significantly, when, its, provenance, can, be, established, a, rodin, work, with, a, verified, history, sold, for, us, 4, 8, million, in, 1999, and, rodin, s, bronze, ve, grand, modele, version, sans, rocher, sold, for, 18, 9, million, at, a, 2008, christie, s, auction, in, new, york, art, critics, concerned, about, authenticity, have, argued, that, taking, a, cast, does, not, equal, reproducing, a, rodin, sculpture, especially, given, the, importance, of, surface, treatment, in, rodin, s, work, a, number, of, drawings, previously, attributed, to, rodin, are, now, known, to, have, been, forged, by, ernest, durig
