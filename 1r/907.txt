regarded, as, the, founder, of, hasidic, judaism, besht, is, the, acronym, for, b, aal, sh, em, t, ov, which, means, good, master, of, the, name, that, is, a, good, baal, shem, one, reputed, to, work, miracles, using, the, secret, name, of, god, the, little, biographical, information, about, the, baal, shem, tov, comes, from, oral, traditions, handed, down, by, his, students, jacob, joseph, of, polonne, and, others, and, from, the, legendary, tales, about, his, life, and, behavior, collected, in, shiv, ei, ha, besht, in, praise, of, the, ba, al, shem, tov, kapust, and, berdychiv, 1814, 15, a, central, tenet, in, the, baal, shem, tov, s, teaching, is, the, direct, connection, with, the, divine, dvekut, which, is, infused, in, every, human, activity, and, every, waking, hour, prayer, is, of, supreme, importance, along, with, the, mystical, significance, of, hebrew, letters, and, words, his, innovation, lies, in, encouraging, worshippers, to, follow, their, distracting, thoughts, to, their, roots, in, the, divine, yisroel, israel, was, born, to, poor, parents, eliezer, and, sarah, in, a, settlement, near, okopy, ternopil, oblast, a, newly, built, fortress, close, to, kameniec, in, west, ukraine, where, zbruch, connects, with, dniester, today, okopy, is, a, village, in, chortkiv, raion, district, of, ternopil, oblast, in, 1703, israel, became, an, orphan, and, was, adopted, by, the, jewish, community, of, tluste, near, zalischyky, it, is, reported, that, after, the, conclusion, of, his, studies, at, the, local, cheder, jewish, elementary, school, he, would, often, wander, into, the, fields, and, forests, that, surrounded, the, village, in, 1710, he, finished, cheder, and, became, an, assistant, to, a, melamed, instructor, in, cheder, in, 1711, at, the, age, of, 13, 14, he, entered, the, chaburas, machane, yisroel, a, group, of, hidden, tzaddikim, led, by, rabbi, adam, baal, shem, sometime, in, 1712, israel, became, a, shammash, sexton, of, the, local, synagogue, he, was, hired, as, a, teacher, s, assistant, in, the, cheders, of, the, small, villages, through, which, they, passed, he, later, related, that, he, took, great, pleasure, in, accompanying, the, children, to, and, from, school, using, this, opportunity, to, recite, prayers, with, them, and, tell, them, torah, stories, the, mezritcher, maggid, the, baal, shem, tov, s, successor, would, later, say, if, only, we, kissed, a, torah, scroll, with, the, same, love, that, my, master, kissed, the, children, when, he, took, them, to, cheder, as, a, teacher, s, assistant, according, to, hasidic, legend, the, baal, shem, tov, would, have, visions, in, which, the, prophet, achiya, hashiloni, would, appear, to, him, in, 1716, the, baal, shem, tov, married, but, soon, his, wife, died, and, he, went, on, travelling, throughout, eastern, galicia, after, serving, for, a, long, time, as, a, helper, in, various, small, communities, of, west, ukraine, he, settled, as, a, melamed, at, tluste, the, besht, was, introduced, to, kabbalah, by, rabbi, adam, baal, shem, of, ropczyce, yiddish, who, was, a, disciple, of, rabbi, yoel, baal, shem, i, of, zamo, yiddish, the, successor, of, rabbi, eliyahu, baal, shem, of, worms, yiddish, the, besht, became, the, leader, of, this, movement, at, the, age, of, 18, caring, for, the, jewish, poor, the, group, of, tzadikim, encouraged, jews, to, move, to, agrarian, lifestyles, as, alternatives, to, the, chronic, poverty, of, city, jews, in, continuation, of, this, policy, they, decided, that, they, needed, to, look, after, the, educational, needs, of, the, children, living, in, small, farm, communities, if, a, suitable, teacher, could, not, be, sourced, they, themselves, would, provide, one, and, therefore, the, baal, shem, tov, became, a, teacher, s, assistant, he, later, commented, the, most, joyous, time, in, my, life, was, teaching, the, small, children, how, to, say, modeh, ani, shema, yisrael, and, kametz, alef, ah, he, was, chosen, by, people, conducting, suits, against, each, other, to, act, as, their, arbitrator, and, mediator, his, services, were, brought, into, frequent, requisition, because, the, jews, had, their, own, civil, courts, in, poland, he, is, said, to, have, made, such, an, impression, on, ephraim, of, brody, that, the, latter, promised, the, besht, his, daughter, chana, in, marriage, the, man, died, however, without, telling, his, daughter, of, her, betrothal, but, when, she, heard, of, her, father, s, wishes, she, agreed, to, comply, with, them, after, their, marriage, the, couple, moved, to, a, village, in, the, carpathians, between, kuty, and, kassowa, where, their, only, income, was, from, his, work, digging, clay, and, lime, which, his, wife, delivered, to, surrounding, villages, the, couple, had, two, children, udl, born, in, 1720, and, zvi, hersh, a, maternal, great, grandson, of, baal, shem, tov, and, his, wife, was, reb, nachman, of, breslov, whose, paternal, ancestry, came, from, according, to, hasidic, tradition, the, maharal, s, family, descended, patrilineally, from, the, babylonian, exilarchs, during, the, era, of, the, geonim, and, therefore, also, from, the, davidic, dynasty, the, besht, later, took, a, position, as, a, shohet, ritual, butcher, in, kshilowice, near, iaslowice, which, he, soon, gave, up, in, order, to, manage, a, village, tavern, that, his, brother, in, law, bought, for, him, his, first, appearance, in, public, was, that, of, an, ordinary, baal, shem, a, faith, healer, who, wrote, amulets, and, prescribed, cures, functioning, as, a, type, of, shaman, after, many, trips, in, podolia, and, volhynia, as, a, baal, shem, besht, considering, his, following, large, enough, and, his, authority, established, decided, about, 1740, to, expound, his, teachings, in, the, shtetl, jewish, village, of, medzhybizh, and, people, mostly, from, the, spiritual, elite, came, to, listen, to, him, medzhybizh, became, the, seat, of, the, movement, and, of, the, medzybizh, hasidic, dynasty, his, following, gradually, increased, and, with, it, the, hostility, of, the, talmudists, the, besht, was, supported, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, by, two, prominent, talmudists, the, brothers, me, r, chief, rabbi, of, lemberg, and, later, ostroha, and, author, of, meir, netivim, a, work, of, halachic, responsa, and, other, works, and, isaac, dov, margalios, later, he, won, over, recognized, rabbinic, authorities, who, became, his, disciples, and, attested, to, his, scholarship, these, include, rabbi, yaakov, yosef, hakohen, rabbi, of, polnoy, rabbi, dovid, halperin, rabbi, of, ostroha, rabbi, israel, of, satinov, author, of, tiferet, yisrael, rabbi, yoseph, heilperin, of, slosowitz, and, rabbi, dov, ber, of, mezrich, aka, the, maggid, of, mezritch, it, is, chiefly, due, to, the, latter, that, besht, s, doctrines, though, in, an, essentially, altered, form, were, introduced, into, learned, jewish, religious, circles, israel, undertook, journeys, in, which, he, is, recorded, as, effecting, cures, and, expelling, demons, and, evil, spirits, shedim, later, hasidic, tradition, however, downplayed, the, importance, of, these, healing, and, magical, practices, concentrating, on, his, teachings, his, charm, magnetism, and, ecstatic, personality, the, agudas, ohalei, tzadikim, organization, based, in, israel, has, restored, many, graves, of, tzadikim, ohelim, in, ukraine, including, the, baal, shem, tov, s, a, guesthouse, and, synagogue, are, located, next, to, the, ohel, of, baal, shem, tov, and, the, baal, shem, tov, s, synagogue, in, the, village, proper, has, been, painstakingly, restored, both, synagogues, are, used, by, the, many, visitors, from, all, over, the, world, the, besht, took, sides, with, the, talmudists, in, their, disputes, against, the, frankists, jacob, frank, s, cultist, movement, which, regarded, frank, as, the, messiah, modelled, after, sabbatai, zevi, after, the, mass, conversion, of, the, frankists, the, baal, shem, tov, allegedly, said, that, as, long, as, a, diseased, limb, is, connected, with, the, body, there, is, hope, that, it, may, be, saved, but, once, amputated, it, is, gone, and, there, is, no, hope, it, is, alleged, that, he, died, out, of, grief, that, the, frankists, left, judaism, he, died, in, medzhybizh, which, was, part, of, poland, today, in, the, khmelnytskyi, oblast, ukraine, israel, ben, eliezer, left, no, books, for, the, kabbalistic, commentary, on, psalm, 107, ascribed, to, him, zhitomir, 1804, sefer, mi, rabbi, yisrael, baal, shem, tov, may, not, be, genuine, therefore, the, most, reliable, record, of, his, teachings, is, in, his, utterances, as, recorded, in, the, works, of, his, disciples, hasidim, most, are, found, in, the, works, of, rabbi, jacob, joseph, of, polnoy, but, since, hasidism, immediately, after, the, death, of, its, founder, was, divided, into, various, parties, each, claiming, for, itself, the, authority, of, besht, the, utmost, of, caution, is, necessary, for, judging, as, to, the, authenticity, of, utterances, ascribed, to, besht, rabbi, jacob, joseph, quotes, over, eight, hundred, teachings, of, his, master, the, besht, in, his, books, in, some, rare, quotes, rabbi, jacob, joseph, states, that, he, s, not, sure, if, these, particular, quotes, are, the, exact, words, of, the, baal, shem, tov, this, seems, to, shows, that, all, other, quotes, he, repeats, are, the, exact, words, he, heard, from, his, master, we, therefore, essentially, have, a, full, book, of, reliable, authentic, teachings, of, the, baal, shem, tov, relayed, meticulously, in, the, exact, words, as, heard, directly, from, his, mouth, this, is, the, most, powerful, direct, historical, evidence, of, the, besht, some, other, direct, historical, evidence, remains, of, the, besht, during, the, days, he, lived, in, medzhybizh, rosman, discovered, numerous, legal, documents, that, shed, light, on, this, period, from, the, polish, czartoryski, noble, family, archives, the, besht, s, house, is, mentioned, on, several, tax, registers, where, it, is, recorded, as, having, tax, free, status, several, of, the, besht, s, colleagues, in, his, stories, from, shivhei, habesht, also, appear, in, polish, court, records, notably, ze, ev, wolf, kitzes, and, dovid, purkes, rosman, contends, that, the, polish, documents, show, the, besht, and, his, followers, were, not, outcasts, or, pariahs, but, rather, a, respected, part, of, mainstream, jewish, communal, life, other, direct, evidence, includes, the, besht, s, daily, prayer, book, siddur, owned, by, the, agudas, chabad, library, in, new, york, with, his, handwritten, personal, notes, in, the, margins, his, grave, can, be, seen, today, in, the, old, jewish, cemetery, in, medzhybizh, chapin, and, weinstock, contend, that, the, besht, was, essentially, the, right, person, in, the, right, place, at, the, right, time, 18th, century, podolia, was, an, ideal, place, to, foster, a, sea, change, in, jewish, thinking, it, had, been, depopulated, one, generation, earlier, due, to, the, khmelnitsky, massacres, a, turkish, occupation, of, podolia, occurred, within, the, besht, s, lifetime, and, along, with, it, the, influence, within, this, frontier, territory, of, sabbatai, zevi, and, his, latter, day, spiritual, descendants, such, as, malach, and, jacob, frank, once, the, polish, magnates, regained, control, from, the, turks, podolia, went, through, an, economic, boom, the, magnates, were, benevolent, to, the, economic, benefits, the, jews, provided, and, encouraged, jewish, resettlement, to, help, protect, the, frontier, from, future, invasions, thus, the, jewish, community, itself, was, essentially, starting, over, the, besht, was, a, mystic, who, claimed, to, have, achieved, devekut, adhesion, meaning, that, his, soul, had, reached, the, high, level, where, he, could, ascend, to, heaven, and, speak, with, any, soul, in, heaven, that, he, wished, to, speak, to, though, his, only, recorded, choice, was, of, the, messiah, and, only, once, and, intervene, between, humans, and, god, he, had, the, ability, to, protect, the, jewish, community, from, plague, and, persecution, he, did, this, through, prayer, according, to, a, letter, from, the, besht, s, brother, in, law, to, the, besht, himself, as, interpreted, by, moshe, rosman, the, latter, was, a, practitioner, of, prophecy, being, able, to, see, a, messianic, figure, arrive, in, jerusalem, despite, living, far, from, the, city, the, brother, in, law, claims, to, have, inquired, into, the, figure, and, discovered, the, besht, s, vision, to, be, true, this, claim, also, supports, the, supposed, belief, that, the, besht, had, the, ability, to, see, the, souls, of, men, divining, the, messianic, quality, of, the, man, despite, only, seeing, him, through, a, vision, rosman, also, describes, another, letter, written, by, the, brother, in, law, which, claims, that, the, besht, could, travel, to, heaven, and, commune, with, god, this, view, is, derived, from, a, series, of, titles, given, to, the, besht, attributing, various, religious, achievements, to, him, such, as, understanding, the, mysteries, of, god, similarly, rosman, though, now, citing, the, writings, of, a, polish, rabbi, says, that, it, was, believed, the, besht, was, a, great, medical, practitioner, with, vast, knowledge, regarding, salves, balms, and, similar, medicants, some, aspects, of, his, medical, practice, are, said, to, have, been, mystic, in, nature, though, the, degree, to, which, this, is, the, case, is, not, agreed, upon, some, claim, that, the, besht, could, only, heal, others, through, prayer, and, similar, acts, recitation, of, holy, words, in, other, works, he, is, said, to, have, fewer, limitations, on, his, supposed, ability, allowing, for, more, mystic, methods, to, be, practised, he, ate, farfel, every, friday, night, because, the, word, was, similar, to, the, world, farfalen, which, means, wiped, out, over, and, finished, he, considered, the, noodles, a, symbol, marking, the, beginning, of, a, new, week, the, besht, s, concept, of, the, zaddik, is, of, the, existence, of, superior, individuals, whose, spiritual, qualities, are, greater, than, those, of, other, human, beings, and, who, are, outstanding, in, their, higher, level, of, devekut, these, individuals, influence, society, and, their, task, is, to, teach, the, people, to, worship, god, by, means, of, devekut, and, to, lead, sinners, to, repent, simon, dubnow, commented, in, 1916, the, righteous, or, tzaddik, is, he, who, lives, up, to, the, precepts, of, hasidism, in, the, highest, measure, attainable, and, is, on, account, of, it, nearer, and, dearer, to, god, than, any, one, else, the, function, of, the, tzaddik, is, to, serve, as, mediator, between, god, and, the, common, people, the, tzaddik, enables, man, to, attain, to, perfect, purity, of, soul, and, to, every, earthly, and, heavenly, blessing, the, tzaddik, ought, to, be, revered, and, looked, up, to, as, god, s, messenger, and, favorite, the, most, characteristic, trait, of, the, hasidim, became, their, boundless, veneration, of, holy, tzaddiks, the, later, developments, of, hasidism, are, unintelligible, without, consideration, of, besht, s, opinion, concerning, man, s, proper, relation, with, the, universe, true, worship, of, god, consists, of, the, cleaving, to, and, the, unification, with, god, to, use, his, own, words, the, ideal, of, man, is, to, be, a, revelation, himself, clearly, to, recognize, himself, as, a, manifestation, of, god, mysticism, he, said, is, not, the, kabbalah, which, everyone, may, learn, but, that, sense, of, true, oneness, which, is, usually, as, strange, unintelligible, and, incomprehensible, to, mankind, as, dancing, is, to, a, dove, however, the, man, who, is, capable, of, this, feeling, is, endowed, with, a, genuine, intuition, and, it, is, the, perception, of, such, a, man, which, is, called, prophecy, according, to, the, degree, of, his, insight, from, this, it, results, in, the, first, place, that, the, ideal, man, may, lay, claim, to, authority, equal, in, a, certain, sense, to, the, authority, of, the, prophets, this, focus, on, oneness, and, personal, revelation, help, earn, his, mystical, interpretation, of, judaism, the, title, of, panentheism, a, second, and, more, important, result, of, the, doctrine, is, that, through, his, oneness, with, god, man, forms, a, connecting, link, between, the, creator, and, creation, thus, slightly, modifying, the, bible, verse, hab, 2, 4, besht, said, the, righteous, can, vivify, by, his, faith, besht, s, followers, enlarged, upon, this, idea, and, consistently, deduced, from, it, the, source, of, divine, mercy, of, blessings, of, life, and, that, therefore, if, one, loves, him, one, may, partake, of, god, s, mercy, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, coin, the, baal, shem, tov, warned, the, hasidim, it, may, be, said, of, hasidism, that, there, is, no, other, jewish, sect, in, which, the, founder, is, as, important, as, his, doctrines, besht, himself, is, still, the, real, center, for, the, hasidim, his, teachings, have, almost, sunk, into, oblivion, as, schechter, studies, in, judaism, p, 4, observes, to, the, hasidim, baal, shem, was, the, incarnation, of, a, theory, and, his, whole, life, the, revelation, of, a, system, besht, did, not, combat, rabbinical, judaism, but, the, spirit, of, its, practice, his, teachings, being, the, result, of, a, deep, religious, temperament, he, stressed, the, spirit, though, he, considered, the, law, to, be, holy, and, inviolable, and, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, torah, study, he, held, that, one, s, entire, life, should, be, a, service, of, god, hasidic, legend, tells, of, a, woman, whom, her, relatives, sought, to, kill, on, account, of, her, shameful, life, but, who, was, saved, in, body, and, soul, by, besht, the, story, is, said, to, be, characteristic, of, besht, s, activity, in, healing, those, in, need, of, relief, more, important, to, him, than, prayer, was, a, friendly, relationship, with, sinners, unselfishness, and, high, minded, benevolence, are, a, motif, in, the, legends, about, him, besht, s, methods, of, teaching, differed, from, those, of, his, opponents, he, directed, many, satirical, remarks, at, them, a, characteristic, one, being, his, designation, of, the, typical, talmudist, of, his, day, as, a, man, who, through, a, sheer, study, of, the, law, has, no, time, to, think, about, god, besht, is, reported, to, have, illustrated, his, views, of, asceticism, by, the, following, parable, besht, held, a, firm, conviction, that, god, had, entrusted, him, with, a, special, mission, to, spread, his, doctrines, he, believed, that, he, had, heavenly, visions, revealing, this, mission, to, him, for, him, every, intuition, was, a, divine, revelation, and, divine, messages, were, daily, occurrences, an, example, of, the, power, of, his, spiritual, vision, is, found, at, the, beginning, of, his, grandson, s, work, degel, where, he, writes, that, his, grandfather, wrote, to, gershon, kitover, who, lived, in, israel, asking, him, why, he, was, not, in, israel, that, particular, shabbos, the, world, makes, three, errors, by, thinking, that, telling, stories, of, the, baal, shem, tov, on, motzei, shabbat, ensures, one, s, livelihood, first, of, all, these, stories, are, not, to, be, limited, to, the, baal, shem, tov, but, should, include, tales, of, all, our, tzaddikim, secondly, they, should, not, be, told, only, after, but, at, any, time, and, lastly, telling, these, stories, not, only, ensures, livelihood, but, serves, as, a, segulah, to, ensure, we, receive, an, abundance, of, blessings, relating, to, our, children, good, health, and, success, in, our, livelihood, in, hasidic, tradition, there, s, a, saying, someone, who, believes, in, all, the, stories, of, the, baal, shem, tov, and, the, other, mystics, and, holy, men, is, a, fool, someone, who, looks, at, any, single, story, and, says, that, one, could, not, be, true, is, a, heretic, according, to, the, encyclopaedia, judaica, the, number, of, legends, that, are, told, relating, to, the, ba, al, shem, tov, have, distorted, his, historical, character, an, anthology, of, legends, about, him, was, first, compiled, by, dov, baer, b, samuel, of, linits, who, was, the, son, in, law, of, alexander, sho, at, who, had, acted, for, several, years, as, the, besht, s, scribe, the, collection, was, copied, many, times, and, over, time, it, became, filled, with, errors, it, was, printed, with, the, title, shiv, ei, ha, besht, after, dov, baer, s, death, it, was, published, by, israel, jaffe, who, rewrote, the, first, chapter, and, removed, what, he, considered, to, be, the, distortions, caused, by, copyists, this, edition, printed, in, kopys, kapust, in, 1814, contains, 230, stories, grouped, by, common, themes, characters, and, motifs, two, editions, also, appeared, in, yiddish, that, differ, markedly, from, the, hebrew, edition, in, the, 19th, century, several, further, collections, of, legends, about, the, ba, al, shem, tov, and, his, followers, appeared, in, hebrew, and, yiddish, some, of, which, repeated, stories, found, in, shiv, ei, ha, besht, and, some, of, which, contained, new, stories, according, to, the, encyclopaedia, judaica, only, a, few, of, these, stories, can, actually, be, regarded, as, true, one, legend, tells, that, his, father, eliezer, was, seized, during, an, attack, carried, from, his, home, in, wallachia, and, sold, as, a, slave, to, a, prince, on, account, of, his, wisdom, he, found, favor, with, the, prince, who, gave, him, to, the, king, to, be, his, minister, during, an, expedition, undertaken, by, the, king, when, other, counsel, failed, and, all, were, disheartened, eliezer, s, advice, was, accepted, and, the, result, was, a, successful, battle, of, decisive, importance, eliezer, was, made, a, general, and, afterward, prime, minister, and, the, king, gave, him, the, daughter, of, the, viceroy, in, marriage, but, being, mindful, of, his, duty, as, a, jew, and, as, he, was, already, married, he, married, the, princess, only, in, name, after, being, questioned, for, a, long, time, as, to, his, strange, conduct, he, confessed, to, the, princess, that, he, was, a, jew, who, loaded, him, with, costly, presents, and, helped, him, escape, to, his, own, country, on, the, way, the, prophet, elijah, is, said, to, have, appeared, to, eliezer, and, said, on, account, of, thy, piety, and, steadfastness, thou, wilt, have, a, son, who, will, lighten, the, eyes, of, all, israel, and, israel, shall, be, his, name, because, in, him, shall, be, fulfilled, the, verse, isaiah, 49, 3, thou, art, my, servant, o, israel, in, whom, i, will, be, glorified, eliezer, and, his, wife, sarah, however, reached, old, age, childless, and, had, given, up, all, hope, of, ever, having, a, child, but, when, they, were, nearly, a, hundred, years, old, the, promised, son, besht, was, born, the, baal, shem, tov, directly, imparted, his, teachings, to, his, students, some, of, whom, founded, their, own, hasidic, dynasties, a, portrait, by, john, singleton, copley, often, mistaken, for, the, baal, shem, tov, is, really, a, portrait, of, hayyim, samuel, jacob, falk, who, was, known, as, the, baal, shem, of, london, in, 2019, the, american, funk, quartet, the, fearless, flyers, released, an, instrumental,
