hong, taiji, 28, november, 1592, 21, september, 1643, also, rendered, as, huang, taiji, and, sometimes, referred, to, as, abahai, in, western, literature, also, known, by, his, temple, name, as, the, emperor, taizong, of, qing, was, the, second, khan, of, the, later, jin, dynasty, and, the, founding, emperor, of, the, qing, dynasty, he, was, responsible, for, consolidating, the, empire, that, his, father, nurhaci, had, founded, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, conquest, of, the, ming, dynasty, although, he, died, before, this, was, accomplished, he, was, also, responsible, for, changing, the, name, of, the, jurchens, to, manchu, in, 1635, and, changing, the, name, of, his, dynasty, from, great, jin, to, great, qing, in, 1636, it, is, unclear, whether, hong, taiji, was, a, title, or, a, personal, name, written, hong, taiji, in, manchu, it, was, borrowed, from, the, mongolian, title, khong, tayiji, that, mongolian, term, was, itself, derived, from, the, chinese, huang, taizi, crown, prince, imperial, prince, but, in, mongolian, it, meant, among, other, things, something, like, respected, son, alternatively, historian, pamela, crossley, argues, that, hung, taiji, was, a, title, of, mongolian, inspiration, derived, from, hung, a, word, that, appeared, in, other, mongolian, titles, at, the, time, early, seventeenth, century, chinese, and, korean, sources, rendered, his, name, as, hong, taiji, the, modern, chinese, rendering, huang, taiji, which, uses, the, character, huang, imperial, misleadingly, implies, that, hong, taiji, once, held, the, title, of, imperial, prince, or, heir, apparent, even, though, his, father, and, predecessor, nurhaci, never, designated, a, successor, hong, taiji, was, very, rarely, used, in, manchu, sources, because, they, observed, a, taboo, on, the, personal, names, of, emperors, in, redacted, documents, hong, taiji, was, simply, called, the, fourth, beile, or, fourth, prince, duici, beile, indicating, that, he, was, the, fourth, ranked, among, the, eight, beile, nurhaci, had, designated, from, among, his, sons, however, an, archival, document, rediscovered, in, 1996, and, recounting, events, from, 1621, calls, him, hong, taiji, in, a, discussion, concerning, the, possible, naming, of, nurhaci, s, heir, apparent, a, title, that, the, document, refers, to, as, taise, tatiana, pang, and, giovanni, stary, two, specialists, of, early, manchu, history, consider, this, document, as, further, evidence, that, hong, taiji, was, his, real, name, not, being, at, all, connected, with, the, chinese, title, huang, taizi, historian, mark, elliott, views, this, as, persuasive, evidence, that, hong, taiji, was, not, a, title, but, a, personal, name, western, scholars, used, to, refer, to, hong, taiji, as, abahai, but, this, appellation, is, now, considered, mistaken, hong, taiji, was, never, mentioned, under, this, name, in, manchu, and, chinese, sources, it, was, a, mistake, first, made, by, russian, clergyman, g, v, gorsky, and, later, repeated, by, sinologists, starting, in, the, early, twentieth, century, giovanni, stary, states, that, this, name, may, have, originated, by, confusing, abkai, with, abkai, sure, which, was, hong, taiji, s, era, name, in, the, manchu, language, though, abahai, is, indeed, unattested, in, manchu, sources, it, might, also, have, derived, from, the, mongol, word, aba, ai, an, honorary, name, given, to, the, younger, sons, of, hereditary, monarchs, according, to, another, view, hong, taiji, was, mistakenly, referred, to, as, abahai, as, a, result, of, a, confusion, with, the, name, of, nurhaci, s, main, consort, lady, abahai, hong, taiji, was, the, second, khan, of, the, later, jin, and, then, emperor, of, the, qing, dynasty, after, he, changed, its, name, his, title, as, great, khan, was, bogd, s, c, n, khaan, manchu, gosin, onco, h, waliyasun, enduringge, han, and, he, was, referred, to, as, bogda, khan, by, his, mongol, subjects, his, reign, names, which, were, used, in, his, lifetime, to, record, dates, were, tiancong, heavenly, wisdom, manchu, abka, i, sure, from, 1627, to, 1636, and, chongde, lofty, virtue, manchu, wesihun, erdemungge, mongolian, deged, erdemt, from, 1636, to, 1643, hong, taiji, s, temple, name, by, which, he, was, worshipped, at, the, imperial, ancestral, temple, was, taizong, the, name, that, was, conventionally, given, to, the, second, emperor, of, a, dynasty, his, posthumous, name, which, was, chosen, to, reflect, his, style, of, rule, was, wen, huangdi, manchu, u, h, wangdi, which, means, the, culturing, emperor, or, the, emperor, of, letters, hong, taiji, was, the, eighth, son, of, nurhaci, whom, he, succeeded, as, the, second, ruler, of, the, later, jin, dynasty, in, 1626, he, might, have, had, mongolian, ancestry, as, the, son, of, yehe, nara, monggo, jerjer, and, he, might, have, been, genetically, related, to, the, mongolic, daur, people, as, a, member, of, the, aisin, gioro, clan, although, it, has, always, been, regarded, as, gossip, he, was, said, to, have, been, involved, in, the, suicide, of, dorgon, s, mother, lady, abahai, in, order, to, block, the, succession, of, his, younger, brother, this, is, speculated, because, at, the, time, of, nurhaci, s, death, there, were, four, lords, beile, with, hong, taiji, holding, the, lowest, rank, but, also, being, the, most, fit, one, originally, at, the, end, of, nurhaci, s, reign, hong, taiji, controlled, the, two, white, banners, but, after, lady, abahai, s, death, he, switched, his, two, banners, with, dorgon, and, dodo, s, two, yellow, banners, in, the, end, hong, taiji, had, control, over, the, highest, class, banners, the, plain, and, bordered, yellow, banners, and, the, most, influence, from, there, he, slowly, got, rid, of, his, competitors, powers, later, he, would, also, receive, the, plain, blue, banner, from, his, fifth, brother, mangg, ltai, which, was, the, third, strongest, banner, those, three, banners, would, officially, become, the, upper, three, banners, during, the, early, years, of, the, qing, dynasty, during, his, reign, hong, taiji, started, recruitment, of, han, chinese, officials, after, a, 1623, revolt, nurhaci, came, to, mistrust, his, nikan, manchu, han, people, followers, so, hong, taiji, began, their, assimilation, into, the, country, and, government, a, mass, marriage, of, han, chinese, officers, and, officials, to, manchu, women, numbering, 1, 000, couples, was, arranged, by, prince, yoto, and, hong, taiji, in, 1632, to, promote, harmony, between, the, two, ethnic, groups, it, is, the, predecessor, of, mongol, yamen, monggo, jurgan, which, was, established, for, indirect, government, of, inner, mongolia, after, the, mongols, were, conquered, by, hong, taiji, in, 1638, it, was, renamed, to, lifanyuan, initially, the, ministerial, affairs, were, settled, while, vice, ministers, were, set, up, as, vice, ministers, he, continued, the, expansion, of, the, later, jin, dynasty, in, manchuria, pushing, deeper, into, the, mongolian, plateau, and, raiding, the, joseon, dynasty, and, the, ming, dynasty, his, personal, military, abilities, were, widely, praised, and, he, effectively, developed, the, military, civil, administration, known, as, the, eight, banners, or, banner, system, this, system, was, well, suited, to, accept, the, different, peoples, primarily, han, and, mongols, who, joined, the, later, jin, state, either, following, negotiated, agreements, or, military, defeat, although, hong, taiji, patronized, tibetan, buddhism, in, public, in, private, he, disdained, the, buddhist, belief, of, the, mongols, and, thought, it, was, destructive, of, mongol, identity, he, is, quoted, to, have, said, that, the, mongolian, princes, are, abandoning, the, mongolian, language, their, names, are, all, in, imitation, of, the, lamas, the, manchus, themselves, such, as, hong, taiji, did, not, personally, believe, in, tibetan, buddhism, and, few, wanted, to, convert, hong, taiji, described, some, tibetan, buddhist, lamas, as, incorrigibles, and, liars, but, still, patronized, buddhism, in, order, to, harness, the, tibetans, and, mongols, belief, in, the, religion, hong, taiji, started, his, conquest, by, subduing, the, potent, ming, ally, in, korea, february, 1627, his, forces, crossed, the, yalu, river, which, had, frozen, in, 1628, he, attempted, to, invade, the, ming, dynasty, but, was, defeated, by, yuan, chonghuan, and, his, use, of, artillery, during, the, next, five, years, hong, taiji, spent, resources, in, training, his, artillery, to, offset, the, strength, of, the, ming, artillery, hong, taiji, upgraded, the, weapons, of, the, empire, he, realized, the, advantage, of, the, red, cannons, and, later, also, bought, the, red, cannons, into, the, army, though, the, ming, dynasty, still, had, more, cannons, hong, taiji, now, possessed, the, cannons, of, equal, might, and, asia, s, strongest, cavalry, also, during, this, time, he, sent, several, probing, raids, into, northern, china, which, were, defeated, first, attack, went, through, the, jehol, pass, then, in, 1632, and, 1634, he, sent, raids, into, shanxi, in, 1636, hong, taiji, invaded, joseon, korea, as, the, latter, did, not, accept, that, hong, taiji, had, become, emperor, and, refused, to, assist, in, operations, against, the, ming, with, the, joseon, dynasty, surrendered, in, 1637, hong, taiji, succeeded, in, making, them, cut, off, relations, with, the, ming, dynasty, and, force, them, to, submit, as, tributary, state, of, the, qing, dynasty, also, during, this, period, hong, taiji, took, over, inner, mongolia, in, three, major, wars, each, of, them, victorious, from, 1636, until, 1644, he, sent, 4, major, expeditions, into, the, amur, region, in, 1640, he, completed, the, conquest, of, the, evenks, when, he, defeated, and, captured, their, leader, bombogor, by, 1644, the, entire, region, was, under, his, control, huang, taji, s, plan, at, first, was, to, make, a, deal, with, the, ming, dynasty, if, the, ming, was, willing, to, give, support, and, money, that, would, be, beneficial, to, the, qing, s, economy, the, qing, in, exchange, would, not, only, be, willing, to, not, attack, the, borders, but, also, admit, itself, as, a, country, one, level, lower, than, the, ming, dynasty, however, since, ming, court, officials, were, reminded, of, the, deal, that, preceded, the, song, dynasty, s, wars, with, the, jin, empire, the, ming, refused, the, exchange, huang, taiji, rejected, the, comparison, saying, that, neither, is, your, ming, ruler, a, descendant, of, the, song, nor, are, we, heir, to, the, jin, that, was, another, time, hong, taiji, had, not, wanted, to, conquer, the, ming, the, ming, s, refusal, ultimately, led, him, to, take, the, offensive, the, people, who, first, encouraged, him, to, invade, the, ming, dynasty, were, his, ethnic, han, advisors, fan, wencheng, ma, guozhu, and, ning, wanwo, hong, taiji, recognized, that, the, manchus, needed, han, defectors, in, order, to, assist, in, the, conquest, of, the, ming, and, thus, explained, to, other, manchus, why, he, also, needed, to, be, lenient, to, recent, defectors, like, ming, general, hong, chengchou, who, surrendered, to, the, qing, in, 1642, when, hong, taiji, came, into, power, the, military, was, composed, of, entirely, mongol, and, manchu, companies, by, 1636, hong, taiji, created, the, first, of, many, chinese, companies, before, the, conquest, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, number, of, companies, organized, by, him, and, his, successor, was, 278, manchus, 120, mongols, and, 165, han, by, the, time, of, hong, taiji, s, death, there, were, more, ethnic, han, than, manchus, and, he, had, realized, the, need, for, there, to, be, control, exerted, whilst, getting, approval, from, the, han, majority, not, only, did, he, incorporate, the, han, into, the, military, but, also, into, the, government, the, council, of, deliberative, officials, was, formed, as, the, highest, level, of, policy, making, and, was, composed, entirely, of, manchu, however, hong, taiji, adopted, from, the, ming, such, institutions, as, the, six, ministries, the, censorate, and, others, each, of, these, lower, ministries, was, headed, by, a, manchu, prince, but, had, four, presidents, two, were, manchu, one, was, mongol, and, one, was, han, this, basic, framework, remained, even, though, the, details, fluctuated, over, time, for, some, time, in, 1635, hong, taiji, changed, the, name, of, his, people, from, jurchen, manchu, ju, en, to, manchu, or, manju, in, the, manchu, language, the, original, meaning, of, manju, is, not, known, and, so, the, reasons, for, its, adoption, remain, opaque, there, are, many, theories, as, to, the, reason, for, the, choice, of, name, but, two, of, the, most, commonly, cited, are, its, sounding, similar, to, the, manchu, word, for, brave, and, a, possible, connection, with, the, bodhisattva, manjusri, the, bodhisattva, of, wisdom, of, whom, nurhaci, claimed, to, be, an, incarnation, the, dynastic, name, later, jin, was, a, direct, reference, to, the, jin, dynasty, founded, by, the, jurchen, people, who, ruled, northern, china, from, 1115, to, 1234, as, such, the, name, was, likely, to, be, viewed, as, closely, tied, to, the, jurchens, and, would, perhaps, evoke, hostility, from, ethnic, han, who, viewed, the, song, dynasty, rival, state, to, the, jin, as, the, legitimate, rulers, of, china, at, that, time, hong, taiji, s, ambition, was, to, conquer, china, proper, and, overthrow, the, ming, dynasty, and, to, do, that, required, not, only, a, powerful, military, force, but, also, an, effective, bureaucratic, administration, for, this, he, used, the, obvious, model, that, of, the, ming, government, and, recruited, ming, officials, to, his, cause, if, the, name, of, later, jin, would, prove, an, impediment, to, his, goal, among, the, han, people, then, it, was, not, too, much, to, change, it, at, the, same, time, hong, taiji, conquered, the, territory, north, of, shanhai, pass, by, ming, dynasty, and, ligdan, khan, in, inner, mongolia, he, won, one, of, the, yuan, dynasty, s, imperial, jade, seal, chinese, and, a, golden, buddha, called, mahakala, in, april, 1636, mongol, nobility, of, inner, mongolia, manchu, nobility, and, the, han, mandarin, held, the, kurultai, in, shenyang, recommended, khan, of, later, jin, to, be, the, emperor, of, great, qing, empire, russian, archive, contains, translations, of, the, 1636, year, hong, taiji, decree, with, the, provision, that, after, the, fall, of, the, qing, dynasty, mongols, will, return, to, their, previous, laws, i, e, independence, whatever, the, precise, motivation, hong, taiji, proclaimed, the, establishment, of, the, qing, dynasty, and, also, changed, his, era, name, to, ch, ngd, in, 1636, the, reasons, for, the, choice, of, qing, as, the, new, name, are, likewise, unclear, although, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, sound, jin, and, qing, are, pronounced, similarly, in, manchu, or, wuxing, theory, traditional, ideas, held, that, fire, associated, with, the, character, for, ming, was, overcome, by, water, associated, with, the, character, for, qing, may, have, influenced, the, choice, another, possible, reason, may, be, that, hong, taiji, changed, the, name, of, the, dynasty, from, later, jin, to, qing, in, 1636, because, of, internecine, fraternal, struggle, and, skirmish, between, brothers, and, half, brothers, for, the, throne, according, to, taoist, philosophy, the, name, jin, has, the, meaning, of, metal, and, fire, in, its, constituent, thereby, igniting, the, tempers, of, the, brothers, of, the, manchu, royal, household, into, open, conflicts, and, wars, hong, taiji, therefore, adopted, the, new, name, of, great, qing, the, chinese, character, of, which, has, the, water, symbol, on, its, left, hand, side, the, name, which, means, clear, and, transparent, with, its, water, symbol, was, hoped, to, put, out, the, feud, among, the, brothers, of, the, manchu, royal, household, hongtaiji, claimed, that, the, progenitor, of, his, aisin, gioro, clan, buk, ri, yong, on, was, conceived, from, a, virgin, birth, according, to, the, legend, three, heavenly, maidens, namely, enggulen, jenggulen, and, fekulen, were, bathing, at, a, lake, called, bulh, ri, omo, near, the, changbai, mountains, a, magpie, dropped, a, piece, of, red, fruit, near, fekulen, who, ate, it, she, then, became, pregnant, with, buk, ri, yong, on, however, another, older, version, of, the, story, by, the, hurha, hurka, tribe, member, muksike, recorded, in, 1635, contradicts, hongtaiji, s, version, on, location, claiming, that, it, was, in, heilongjiang, province, close, to, the, amur, river, where, bulhuri, lake, was, located, where, the, heavenly, maidens, took, their, bath, this, was, recorded, in, the, jiu, manzhou, dang, and, his, much, shorter, and, simpler, in, addition, to, being, older, this, is, believed, to, be, the, original, version, and, hongtaiji, changed, it, to, changbai, mountain, it, shows, that, the, aisin, gioro, clan, originated, in, the, amur, area, and, the, heje, hezhen, and, other, amur, valley, jurchen, tribes, had, an, oral, version, of, the, same, tale, it, also, fits, with, jurchen, history, since, some, ancestors, of, the, manchus, originated, north, before, the, 14th, 15th, centuries, in, the, amur, and, only, later, moved, south, before, hong, taiji, was, emperor, he, controlled, the, two, white, banners, upon, nurhaci, s, death, hong, taiji, immediately, switched, his, two, white, banners, with, nurhaci, s, two, yellow, banners, which, should, have, been, passed, on, to, dorgon, and, his, brothers, as, emperor, he, was, the, holder, of, three, banners, out, of, eight, he, controlled, the, upper, three, banners, or, the, elite, banners, which, at, the, time, were, the, plain, bordered, yellow, banners, and, plain, blue, banner, later, the, plain, blue, banner, was, switched, by, dorgon, to, the, plain, white, banner, as, the, third, elite, banner, at, the, end, of, his, reign, hong, taiji, gave, the, two, yellow, banners, to, his, eldest, son, hooge, daisan, who, was, the, second, son, of, nurhaci, and, his, son, controlled, the, two, red, banners, dorgon, and, his, two, brothers, controlled, the, two, white, banners, and, urhaci, s, son, jirgalang, controlled, the, remaining, bordered, blue, banner, hong, taiji, died, on, 21, september, 1643, just, as, the, qing, was, preparing, to, attack, shanhai, pass, the, last, ming, fortification, guarding, access, to, the, north, china, plains, because, he, died, without, having, named, an, heir, the, qing, state, now, faced, a, succession, crisis, the, deliberative, council, of, princes, and, ministers, debated, on, whether, to, grant, the, throne, to, hong, taiji, s, half, brother, dorgon, a, proven, military, leader, or, to, hong, taiji, s, eldest, son, hooge, as, a, compromise, hong, taiji, s, five, year, old, ninth, son, fulin, was, chosen, while, dorgon, alongside, nurhaci, s, nephew, jirgalang, was, given, the, title, of, prince, regent, fulin, was, officially, crowned, emperor, of, the, qing, dynasty, on, 8, october, 1643, and, it, was, decided, that, he, would, reign, under, the, era, name, shunzhi, a, few, months, later, qing, armies, led, by, dorgon, seized, beijing, and, the, young, shunzhi, emperor, became, the, first, qing, emperor, to, rule, from, that, new, capital, that, the, qing, state, succeeded, not, only, in, conquering, china, but, also, in, establishing, a, capable, administration, was, due, in, large, measure, to, the, foresight, and, policies, of, hong, taiji, his, body, was, buried, in, zhaoling, located, in, northern, shenyang, as, the, emperor, he, is, commonly, recognized, as, having, abilities, similar, to, the, best, emperors, such, as, yongle, emperor, taizong, of, tang, due, to, his, effective, rule, use, of, talent, and, warring, skills, according, to, historian, jin, yong, hong, taiji, had, the, broad, and, wise, views, of, qin, shi, huang, emperor, gaozu, of, han, emperor, guangwu, of, han, emperor, wen, of, sui, emperor, taizong, of, tang, emperor, taizu, of, song, kublai, khan, the, hongwu, emperor, and, the, yongle, emperor, his, political, abilities, were, paralleled, only, by, genghis, khan, emperor, taizong, of, tang, and, emperor, guangwu, of, han, in, this, sense, hong, taiji, is, considered, by, some, historians, as, the, true, first, emperor, for, the, qing, dynasty, some, historians, suspect, hong, taiji, was, overall, underrated, and, overlooked, as, a, great, emperor, because, he, was, a, manchu, empress, primary, consort, secondary, consort, concubine, enthroned, in, 1626, as, khan, hong, taiji, changed, the, dynastic, name, to, great, qing, in, 1636, and, claimed, the, title, of, emperor, in, 1644, the, shunzhi, emperor, began, to, rule, over, china, proper, replacing, the, ming, dynasty
