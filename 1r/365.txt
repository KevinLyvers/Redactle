remarked, this, country, does, not, need, a, talleyrand, but, a, saint, just, the, reality, of, the, postwar, tribunals, soon, changed, his, mind, camus, publicly, reversed, himself, and, became, a,

camus, was, firmly, against, any, kind, of, exploitation, authority, property, the, state, and, centralization, however, he, opposed, revolution, separating, the, rebel, from, the, revolutionary, and, believing, that, the, belief, in, absolute, truth, most, often, assuming, the, guise, of, history, or, reason, inspires, the, revolutionary, and, leads, to, tragic, results, he, believed, that, rebellion, is, spurred, by, our, outrage, over, the, world, s, lack, of, transcendent, significance, while, political, rebellion, is, our, response, to, attacks, against, the, dignity, and, autonomy, of, the, individual, camus, opposed, political, violence, tolerating, it, only, in, rare, and, very, narrowly, defined, instances, as, well, as, revolutionary, terror, which, he, accused, of,

among, other, pieds, noirs, french, or, europeans, born, in, algeria, for, camus, this, vision, encapsulated, the, hellenic, humanism, which, survived, among, ordinary, people, around, the, mediterranean, sea, his, 1938, address, on, the, new, mediterranean, culture, represents, camus, s, most, systematic, statement, of, his, views, at, this, time, camus, also, supported, the, blum, viollette, proposal, to, grant, algerians, full, french, citizenship, in, a, manifesto, with, arguments, defending, this, assimilative, proposal, on, radical, egalitarian, grounds, in, 1939, camus, wrote, a, stinging, series, of, articles, for, the, alger, r, publicain, on, the, atrocious, living, conditions, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, kabylie, highlands, he, advocated, for, economic, educational, and, political, reforms, as, a, matter, of, emergency, in, 1945, following, the, s, tif, and, guelma, massacre, after, arabs, revolted, against, french, mistreatment, camus, was, one, of, only, a, few, mainland, journalists, to, visit, the, colony, he, wrote, a, series, of, articles, reporting, on, conditions, and, advocating, for, french, reforms, and, concessions, to, the, demands, of, the, algerian, people, when, the, algerian, war, began, in, 1954, camus, was, confronted, with, a, moral, dilemma, he, identified, with, the, pieds, noirs, such, as, his, own, parents, and, defended, the, french, government, s, actions, against, the, revolt, he, argued, the, algerian, uprising, was, an, integral, part, of, the, new, arab, imperialism, led, by, egypt, and, an, anti, western, offensive, orchestrated, by, russia, to, encircle, europe, and, isolate, the, united, states, although, favoring, greater, algerian, autonomy, or, even, federation, though, not, full, scale, independence, he, believed, the, pieds, noirs, and, arabs, could, co, exist, during, the, war, he, advocated, a, civil, truce, that, would, spare, the, civilians, it, was, rejected, by, both, sides, who, regarded, it, as, foolish, behind, the, scenes, he, began, working, for, imprisoned, algerians, who, faced, the, death, penalty, his, position, drew, much, criticism, from, the, left, and, later, postcolonial, literary, critics, such, as, edward, said, who, were, opposed, to, european, imperialism, and, charged, that, camus, s, novels, and, short, stories, are, plagued, with, colonial, depictions, or, conscious, erasures, of, algeria, s, arab, population, in, their, eyes, camus, was, no, longer, the, defender, of, the, oppressed, camus, once, said, that, the, troubles, in, algeria, affected, him, as, others, feel, pain, in, their, lungs, even, though, camus, is, mostly, connected, to, absurdism, he, is, routinely, categorized, as, an, existentialist, a, term, he, rejected, on, several, occasions, camus, himself, said, his, philosophical, origins, lay, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, nietzsche, and, 17th, century, moralists, whereas, existentialism, arose, from, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, philosophy, such, as, s, ren, kierkegaard, karl, jaspers, and, martin, heidegger, he, also, said, his, work, the, myth, of, sisyphus, was, a, criticism, of, various, aspects, of, existentialism, camus, rejected, existentialism, as, a, philosophy, but, his, critique, was, mostly, focused, on, sartrean, existentialism, and, though, to, a, lesser, extent, on, religious, existentialism, he, thought, that, the, importance, of, history, held, by, marx, and, sartre, was, incompatible, with, his, belief, in, human, freedom, david, sherman, and, others, also, suggest, the, rivalry, between, sartre, and, camus, also, played, a, part, in, his, rejection, of, existentialism, david, simpson, argues, further, that, his, humanism, and, belief, in, human, nature, set, him, apart, from, the, existentialist, doctrine, that, existence, precedes, essence, on, the, other, hand, camus, focused, most, of, his, philosophy, around, existential, questions, the, absurdity, of, life, and, that, it, inevitably, ends, in, death, is, highlighted, in, his, acts, his, belief, was, that, the, absurd, life, being, void, of, meaning, or, man, s, inability, to, know, that, meaning, if, it, were, to, exist, was, something, that, man, should, embrace, his, opposition, to, christianity, and, his, commitment, to, individual, moral, freedom, and, responsibility, are, only, a, few, of, the, similarities, with, other, existential, writers, camus, addressed, one, of, the, fundamental, questions, of, existentialism, the, problem, of, suicide, he, wrote, there, is, only, one, really, serious, philosophical, question, and, that, is, suicide, camus, viewed, the, question, of, suicide, as, arising, naturally, as, a, solution, to, the, absurdity, of, life, many, existentialist, writers, have, addressed, the, absurd, each, with, their, own, interpretation, of, what, it, is, and, what, makes, it, important, kierkegaard, suggests, that, the, absurdity, of, religious, truths, prevents, people, from, reaching, god, rationally, sartre, recognizes, the, absurdity, of, individual, experience, camus, s, thoughts, on, the, absurd, begin, with, his, first, cycle, of, books, and, the, literary, essay, the, myth, of, sisyphus, his, major, work, on, the, subject, in, 1942, he, published, the, story, of, a, man, living, an, absurd, life, in, the, stranger, he, also, wrote, a, play, about, the, roman, emperor, caligula, pursuing, an, absurd, logic, which, was, not, performed, until, 1945, his, early, thoughts, appeared, in, his, first, collection, of, essays, betwixt, and, between, in, 1937, absurd, themes, were, expressed, with, more, sophistication, in, his, second, collection, of, essays, noces, nuptials, in, 1938, in, these, essays, camus, reflects, on, the, experience, of, the, absurd, aspects, of, the, notion, of, the, absurd, can, also, be, found, in, the, plague, camus, follows, sartre, s, definition, of, the, absurd, that, which, is, meaningless, thus, man, s, existence, is, absurd, because, his, contingency, finds, no, external, justification, the, absurd, is, created, because, man, who, is, placed, in, an, unintelligent, universe, realises, that, human, values, are, not, founded, on, a, solid, external, component, as, camus, himself, explains, the, absurd, is, the, result, of, the, confrontation, between, human, need, and, the, unreasonable, silence, of, the, world, even, though, absurdity, is, inescapable, camus, does, not, drift, towards, nihilism, but, the, realization, of, absurdity, leads, to, the, question, why, should, someone, continue, to, live, suicide, is, an, option, that, camus, firmly, dismisses, as, the, renunciation, of, human, values, and, freedom, rather, he, proposes, we, accept, that, absurdity, is, a, part, of, our, lives, and, live, with, it, the, turning, point, in, camus, s, attitude, to, the, absurd, occurs, in, a, collection, of, four, letters, to, an, anonymous, german, friend, written, between, july, 1943, and, july, 1944, the, first, was, published, in, the, revue, libre, in, 1943, the, second, in, the, cahiers, de, lib, ration, in, 1944, and, the, third, in, the, newspaper, libert, s, in, 1945, the, four, letters, were, published, as, lettres, un, ami, allemand, letters, to, a, german, friend, in, 1945, and, were, included, in, the, collection, resistance, rebellion, and, death, camus, regretted, the, continued, reference, to, himself, as, a, philosopher, of, the, absurd, he, showed, less, interest, in, the, absurd, shortly, after, publishing, the, myth, of, sisyphus, to, distinguish, his, ideas, scholars, sometimes, refer, to, the, paradox, of, the, absurd, when, referring, to, camus, s, absurd, camus, articulated, the, case, for, revolting, against, any, kind, of, oppression, injustice, or, whatever, disrespects, the, human, condition, he, is, cautious, enough, however, to, set, the, limits, on, the, rebellion, the, rebel, explains, in, detail, his, thoughts, on, the, issue, there, he, builds, upon, the, absurd, described, in, the, myth, of, sisyphus, but, goes, further, in, the, introduction, where, he, examines, the, metaphysics, of, rebellion, he, concludes, with, the, phrase, i, revolt, therefore, we, exist, implying, the, recognition, of, a, common, human, condition, camus, also, delineates, the, difference, between, revolution, and, rebellion, and, notices, that, history, has, shown, that, the, rebel, s, revolution, might, easily, end, up, as, an, oppressive, regime, he, therefore, places, importance, on, the, morals, accompanying, the, revolution, camus, poses, a, crucial, question, is, it, possible, for, humans, to, act, in, an, ethical, and, meaningful, manner, in, a, silent, universe, according, to, him, the, answer, is, yes, as, the, experience, and, awareness, of, the, absurd, creates, the, moral, values, and, also, sets, the, limits, of, our, actions, camus, separates, the, modern, form, of, rebellion, into, two, modes, first, there, is, the, metaphysical, rebellion, which, is, the, movement, by, which, man, protests, against, his, condition, and, against, the, whole, of, creation, the, other, mode, historical, rebellion, is, the, attempt, to, materialize, the, abstract, spirit, of, metaphysical, rebellion, and, change, the, world, in, this, attempt, the, rebel, must, balance, between, the, evil, of, the, world, and, the, intrinsic, evil, which, every, revolt, carries, and, not, cause, any, unjustifiable, suffering, camus, s, novels, and, philosophical, essays, are, still, influential, after, his, death, interest, in, camus, followed, the, rise, and, diminution, of, the, new, left, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, interest, in, his, alternative, road, to, communism, resurfaced, he, is, remembered, for, his, skeptical, humanism, and, his, support, for, political, tolerance, dialogue, and, civil, rights, although, camus, has, been, linked, to, anti, soviet, communism, reaching, as, far, as, anarcho, syndicalism, some, neoliberals, have, tried, to, associate, him, with, their, policies, for, instance, the, french, president, nicolas, sarkozy, suggested, that, his, remains, be, moved, to, the, panth, on, an, idea, that, was, criticised, by, camus, s, surviving, family, and, angered, many, on, the, left, american, heavy, metal, band, avenged, sevenfold, stated, that, their, album, life, is, but, a, dream, was, inspired, by, the, work, of, camus, albert, camus, also, served, as, the, inspiration, for, the, aquarius, gold, saint, camus, in, the, classic, anime, and, manga, saint, seiya, in, tipasa, algeria, inside, the, roman, ruins, facing, the, sea, and, mount, chenoua, a, stele, was, erected, in, 1961, in, honor, of, albert, camus, with, this, phrase, in, french, extracted, from, his, work, noces, tipasa, i, understand, here, what, is, called, glory, the, right, to, love, beyond, measure, french, je, comprends, ici, ce, qu, on, appelle, gloire, le, droit, d, aimer, sans, mesure, the, french, post, published, a, stamp, with, his, likeness, on, 26, june, 1967, the, works, of, albert, camus, include
