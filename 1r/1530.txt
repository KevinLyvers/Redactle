african, campaign, a, number, of, historians, have, since, rejected, the, phrase, as, a, myth, and, uncovered, numerous, examples, of, german, war, crimes, and, abuses, towards, enemy, soldiers, and, native, populations, in, africa, during, the, conflict, other, historians, note, that, there, is, no, clear, evidence, rommel, was, involved, or, aware, of, these, crimes, with, some, pointing, out, that, the, war, in, the, desert, as, fought, by, rommel, and, his, opponents, still, came, as, close, to, a, clean, fight, as, there, was, in, world, war, ii, he, later, commanded, the, german, forces, opposing, the, allied, cross, channel, invasion, of, normandy, in, june, 1944, after, the, nazis, gained, power, in, germany, rommel, gradually, accepted, the, new, regime, historians, have, given, different, accounts, of, the, specific, period, and, his, motivations, he, was, a, supporter, of, adolf, hitler, at, least, until, near, the, end, of, the, war, if, not, necessarily, sympathetic, to, the, party, and, the, paramilitary, forces, associated, with, it, in, 1944, rommel, was, implicated, in, the, 20, july, plot, to, assassinate, hitler, because, of, rommel, s, status, as, a, national, hero, hitler, wanted, to, eliminate, him, quietly, instead, of, having, him, immediately, executed, as, many, other, plotters, were, rommel, was, given, a, choice, between, suicide, in, return, for, assurances, that, his, reputation, would, remain, intact, and, that, his, family, would, not, be, persecuted, following, his, death, or, facing, a, trial, that, would, result, in,

portray, him, as, an, apolitical, brilliant, commander, and, a, victim, of, nazi, germany, although, other, authors, have, contested, this, assessment, and, called, it, the, rommel, myth, rommel, s, reputation, for, conducting, a, clean, war, was, used, in, the, interest, of, the, west, german, rearmament, and, reconciliation, between, the, former, enemies, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, on, one, side, and, the, new, federal, republic, of, germany, on, the, other, several, of, rommel, s, former, subordinates, notably, his, chief, of, staff, hans, speidel, played, key, roles,

taking, advantage, of, the, terrain, to, outflank, the, italian, forces, attacking, from, unexpected, directions, or, behind, enemy, lines, and, taking, the, initiative, to, attack, when, he, had, orders, to, the, contrary, in, one, instance, the, italian, forces, taken, by, surprise, and, believing, that, their, lines, had, collapsed, surrendered, after, a, brief, firefight, in, this, battle, rommel, helped, pioneer, infiltration, tactics, a, new, form, of, manoeuvre, warfare, just, being, adopted, by, german, armies, and, later, by, foreign, armies, and, later, described, by, some, as,

confrontations, in, 1919, he, was, briefly, sent, to, friedrichshafen, on, lake, constance, where, he, restored, order, by, sheer, force, of, personality, in, the, 32nd, internal, security, company,

again, bloodless, he, was, then, posted, to, the, ruhr, where, a, red, army, was, responsible, for, fomenting, unrest, historian, raffael, scheck, praises, rommel, as, a, coolheaded, and, moderate, mind, exceptional, amid, the, many, takeovers, of, revolutionary, cities, by, regular, and, irregular, units, and, the, associated, massive, violence, according, to, reuth, this, period, gave, rommel, the, indelible, impression, that, everyone, in, this, republic, was, fighting, each, other, along, with, the, direct, experience, of, people, who, attempted, to, convert, germany, into, a, socialist, republic, on, soviet, lines, there, are, similarities, with, hitler, s, experiences, like, rommel, hitler, had, known, the, solidarity, of, trench, warfare, and, then, had, participated, in, the, reichswehr, s, suppression, of, the, first, and, second, bavarian, soviet, republics, the, need, for, national, unity, thus, became, a, decisive, legacy, of, the, first, world, war, brighton, notes, that, while, both, believed, in, the, stab, in, the, back, myth, rommel, was, able, to, succeed, using, peaceful, methods, because, he, saw, the, problem, as, related, to, economic, problems, and, empty, stomachs, rather, than, to, judeo, bolshevism, which, right, wing, soldiers, such, as, hitler, blamed, for, the, chaos, in, germany, on, 1, october, 1920, rommel, was, appointed, to, a, company, command, with, the, 13th, infantry, regiment, in, stuttgart, a, post, he, held, for, the, next, nine, years, he, was, then, assigned, to, an, instruction, position, at, the, dresden,

three, years, his, book, infanterie, greift, an, infantry, attacks, a, description, of, his, wartime, experiences, along, with, his, analysis, was, published, in, 1937, it, became, a, best, seller, which, according, to, scheck, later, enormously, influenced, many, armies, of, the, world, adolf, hitler, was, one, of, many, people, who, owned, a, copy, hearing, of, rommel, s, reputation, as, an, outstanding, military, instructor, in, february, 1937, hitler, assigned, him, as, the, war, ministry, liaison, officer, to, the, hitler, youth, in, charge, of, military, training, here, rommel, clashed, with, baldur, von, schirach, the, hitler, youth, leader, over, the, training, that, the, boys, should, receive, trying, to, fulfil, a, mission, assigned, to, him, by, the, ministry, of, war, rommel, had, twice, proposed, a, plan, that, would, have, effectively, subordinated, hitler, youth, to, the, army, removing, it, from, nsdap, control, that, went, against, schirach, s, express, wishes, schirach, appealed, directly, to, hitler, consequently, rommel, was, quietly, removed, from, the, project, in, 1938, he, had, been, promoted, to, oberst, colonel, on, 1, august, 1937, and, in, 1938, following, the, anschluss, he, was, appointed, commandant, of, the, theresian, military, academy, at, wiener, neustadt, in, october, 1938, hitler, specially, requested, that, rommel, be, seconded, to, command, the, f, hrerbegleitbatallion, his, escort, battalion, this, unit, accompanied, hitler, whenever, he, travelled, outside, of, germany, during, this, period, rommel, indulged, his, interest, in, engineering, and, mechanics, by, learning, about, the, inner, workings, and, maintenance, of, internal, combustion, engines, and, heavy, machine, guns, he, memorised, logarithm, tables, in, his, spare, time, and, enjoyed, skiing, and, other, outdoor, sports, ian, f, beckett, writes, that, by, 1938, rommel, drifted, towards, uncritical, acceptance, of, nazi, regime, quoting, rommel, s, letter, to, his, wife, in, which, he, stated, the, german, wehrmacht, is, the, sword, of, the, new, german, world, view, as, a, reaction, to, a, speech, by, hitler, during, his, visit, to, switzerland, in, 1938, rommel, reported, that, swiss, soldiers, who, he, met, showed, remarkable, understanding, of, our, jewish, problem, american, writer, and, rommel, biographer, daniel, allen, butler, comments, that, he, did, share, the, view, popular, in, germany, and, many, european, countries, during, that, time, that, as, a, people, the, jews, were, loyal, to, themselves, rather, than, the, nations, in, which, they, lived, despite, this, fact, other, pieces, of, evidence, show, that, he, considered, the, nazi, racial, ideologies, to, be, rubbish, historian, alaric, searle, comments, that, rommel, knew, the, official, stand, of, the, regime, but, in, this, case, the, phrase, was, ambiguous, and, there, is, no, evidence, after, or, before, this, event, that, he, ever, sympathised, with, the, antisemitism, of, the, nazi, movement, rommel, s, son, manfred, rommel, stated, in, the, documentary, the, real, rommel, released, in, 2001, by, channel, 4, that, his, father, would, look, the, other, way, when, faced, with, anti, jewish, violence, on, the, streets, but, according, to, the, documentary, rommel, requested, proof, of, aryan, descent, from, the, italian, boyfriend, of, his, illegitimate, daughter, gertrud, according, to, remy, during, the, time, rommel, was, posted, in, goslar, he, repeatedly, clashed, with, the, sa, whose, members, terrorised, the, jews, and, dissident, goslar, citizens, after, the, r, hm, purge, he, mistakenly, believed, that, the, worst, was, over, although, restrictions, on, jewish, businesses, were, still, being, imposed, and, agitation, against, their, community, continued, according, to, remy, manfred, rommel, recounts, that, his, father, knew, about, and, privately, disagreed, with, the, government, s, antisemitism, but, by, this, time, he, had, not, actively, campaigned, on, behalf, of, the, jews, however, uri, avnery, notes, that, even, when, rommel, was, a, low, ranking, officer, he, protected, the, jews, who, lived, in, his, district, manfred, rommel, tells, the, stuttgarter, nachrichten, that, their, family, lived, in, isolated, military, lands, but, knew, about, the, discrimination, against, the, jews, which, was, occurring, on, the, outside, they, could, not, foresee, the, enormity, of, the, impending, atrocities, about, which, they, only, knew, much, later, at, one, point, rommel, wrote, to, his, wife, that, hitler, had, a, magnetic, maybe, hypnotic, strength, that, had, its, origin, in, hitler, s, belief, that, he, was, called, upon, by, god, and, hitler, sometimes, spoke, from, the, depth, of, his, being, like, a, prophet, rommel, was, promoted, to, generalmajor, on, 23, august, 1939, and, assigned, as, commander, of, the, f, hrerbegleitbatallion, tasked, with, guarding, hitler, and, his, field, headquarters, during, the, invasion, of, poland, which, began, on, 1, september, according, to, remy, rommel, s, private, letters, at, this, time, show, that, he, did, not, understand, hitler, s, true, nature, and, intentions, as, he, quickly, went, from, predicting, a, swift, peaceful, settlement, of, tensions, to, approving, hitler, s, reaction, bombs, will, be, retaliated, with, bombs, to, the, gleiwitz, incident, a, false, flag, operation, staged, by, hitler, and, used, as, a, pretext, for, the, invasion, hitler, took, a, personal, interest, in, the, campaign, often, moving, close, to, the, front, in, the, f, hrersonderzug, headquarters, train, rommel, attended, hitler, s, daily, war, briefings, and, accompanied, him, everywhere, making, use, of, the, opportunity, to, observe, first, hand, the, use, of, tanks, and, other, motorised, units, on, 26, september, rommel, returned, to, berlin, to, set, up, a, new, headquarters, for, his, unit, in, the, reich, chancellery, rommel, briefly, returned, to, occupied, warsaw, on, 5, october, in, order, to, prepare, for, the, german, victory, parade, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, he, claimed, that, the, occupation, by, nazi, germany, was, probably, welcomed, with, relief, by, the, inhabitants, of, the, ruined, city, and, that, they, were, rescued, following, the, invasion, of, poland, rommel, began, lobbying, for, command, of, one, of, germany, s, panzer, divisions, of, which, there, were, then, only, ten, rommel, s, successes, in, world, war, i, were, based, on, surprise, and, manoeuvre, two, elements, for, which, the, new, panzer, units, were, ideally, suited, rommel, received, a, promotion, to, a, general, s, rank, from, hitler, ahead, of, more, senior, officers, rommel, obtained, the, command, he, aspired, to, despite, having, been, earlier, turned, down, by, the, army, s, personnel, office, which, had, offered, him, command, of, a, mountain, division, instead, according, to, peter, caddick, adams, he, was, backed, by, hitler, the, influential, fourteenth, army, commander, wilhelm, list, a, fellow, w, rttemberger, middle, class, military, outsider, and, likely, heinz, guderian, the, commander, of, xix, army, corps, as, well, going, against, military, protocol, this, promotion, added, to, rommel, s, growing, reputation, as, one, of, hitler, s, favoured, commanders, although, his, later, outstanding, leadership, in, france, quelled, complaints, about, his, self, promotion, and, political, scheming, the, 7th, panzer, division, had, recently, been, converted, to, an, armoured, division, consisting, of, 218, tanks, in, three, battalions, thus, one, tank, regiment, instead, of, the, two, assigned, to, a, standard, panzer, division, with, two, rifle, regiments, a, motorcycle, battalion, an, engineer, battalion, and, an, anti, tank, battalion, upon, taking, command, on, 10, february, 1940, rommel, quickly, set, his, unit, to, practising, the, manoeuvres, they, would, need, in, the, upcoming, campaign, the, invasion, began, on, 10, may, 1940, by, the, third, day, rommel, and, the, advance, elements, of, his, division, together, with, a, detachment, of, the, 5th, panzer, division, had, reached, the, meuse, where, they, found, the, bridges, had, already, been, destroyed, guderian, and, georg, hans, reinhardt, reached, the, river, on, the, same, day, rommel, was, active, in, the, forward, areas, directing, the, efforts, to, make, a, crossing, which, were, initially, unsuccessful, because, of, suppressive, fire, by, the, french, on, the, other, side, of, the, river, rommel, brought, up, tanks, and, flak, units, to, provide, counter, fire, and, had, nearby, houses, set, on, fire, to, create, a, smokescreen, he, sent, infantry, across, in, rubber, boats, appropriated, the, bridging, tackle, of, the, 5th, panzer, division, personally, grabbed, a, light, machine, gun, to, fight, off, a, french, counterattack, supported, by, tanks, and, went, into, the, water, himself, encouraging, the, sappers, and, helping, lash, together, the, pontoons, by, 16, may, rommel, reached, avesnes, and, contravening, orders, he, pressed, on, to, cateau, that, night, the, french, ii, army, corps, was, shattered, and, on, 17, may, rommel, s, forces, took, 10, 000, prisoners, losing, 36, men, in, the, process, he, was, surprised, to, find, out, only, his, vanguard, had, followed, his, tempestuous, surge, the, high, command, and, hitler, had, been, extremely, nervous, about, his, disappearance, although, they, awarded, him, the, knight, s, cross, rommel, s, and, guderian, s, successes, and, the, new, possibilities, offered, by, the, new, tank, arm, were, welcomed, by, a, small, number, of, generals, but, worried, and, paralysed, the, rest, on, 20, may, rommel, reached, arras, general, hermann, hoth, received, orders, that, the, town, should, be, bypassed, and, its, british, garrison, thus, isolated, he, ordered, the, 5th, panzer, division, to, move, to, the, west, and, the, 7th, panzer, division, to, the, east, flanked, by, the, ss, division, totenkopf, the, following, day, the, british, launched, a, counterattack, in, the, battle, of,

as, a, fire, demonstration, according, to, one, witness, report, the, smoke, from, burning, rouen, was, intense, enough, that, it, reached, paris, daniel, allen, butler, states, that, the, bridges,

sirte, rommel, resorted, to, subterfuge, and, insubordination, to, take, the, war, to, the, british, according, to, remy, the, general, staff, tried, to, slow, him, down, but, hitler, encouraged, him, to, advance, an, expression, of, the, conflict, that, had, existed, between, hitler, and, the, army, leadership, since, the, invasion, of, poland, he, decided, to, launch, a, limited, offensive, on, 24, march, with, the, 5th, light, division, supported, by, two, italian, divisions, this, thrust, was, not, anticipated, by, the, british, who, had, ultra, intelligence, showing, that, rommel, had, orders, to, remain, on, the, defensive, until, at, least, may, when, the, 15th, panzer, division, were, due, to, arrive, the, british, western, desert, force, had, meanwhile, been, weakened, by, the,

british, pulled, out, of, the, city, gariboldi, who, had, ordered, rommel, to, stay, in, mersa, el, brega, was, furious, rommel, was, equally, forceful, in, his, response, telling, gariboldi, one, cannot, permit, unique, opportunities, to, slip, by, for, the, sake, of, trifles, a, signal, arrived, from, general, franz, halder, reminding, rommel, that, he, was, to, halt, in, mersa, el, brega, knowing, gariboldi, could, not, speak, german, rommel, told, him, the, message, gave, him, complete, freedom, of, action, gariboldi, backed, down, throughout, the, campaign, fuel, supply, was,

which, was, besieged, on, 11, april, the, siege, of, tobruk, was, not, technically, a, siege, as, the, defenders, were, still, able, to, move, supplies, and, reinforcements, into, the, city, via, the, port, rommel, knew, that, by, capturing, the, port, he, could, greatly, reduce, the, length, of, his, supply, lines, and, increase, his, overall, port, capacity, which, was, insufficient, even, for, day, to, day, operations, and, only, half, that, needed, for, offensive, operations, the, city, which, had, been, heavily, fortified, by, the, italians, during, their, 30, year, occupation, was,

under, the, command, of, general, gastone, gambara, were, under, italian, control, two, months, later, hitler, decided, he, must, have, german, officers, in, better, control, of, the, mediterranean, theatre, and, appointed, field, marshal, albert, kesselring, as, commander, in, chief, south, kesselring, was, ordered, to, get, control, of, the, air, and, sea, between, africa, and, italy, following, his, success, in, battleaxe, rommel, returned, his, attention, to, the, capture, of, tobruk, he, made, preparations, for, a, new, offensive, to, be, launched, between, 15, and, 20, november, meanwhile, auchinleck, reorganised, allied, forces, and, strengthened, them, to, two, corps, xxx, and, xiii, which, formed, the, british, eighth, army, it, was, placed, under, the, command, of, alan, cunningham, auchinleck, launched, operation, crusader, a, major, offensive, to, relieve, tobruk, on, 18, november, 1941, rommel, reluctantly, decided, on, 20, november, to, call, off, his, planned, attack, on, tobruk, in, four, days, of, heavy, fighting, the, eighth, army, lost, 530, tanks, and, rommel, only, 100, wanting, to, exploit, the, british, halt, and, their, apparent, disorganisation, on, 24, november, rommel, counterattacked, near, the, egyptian, border, in, an, operation, that, became, known, as, the, dash, to, the, wire, cunningham, asked, auchinleck, for, permission, to, withdraw, into, egypt, but, auchinleck, refused, and, soon, replaced, cunningham, as, commander, of, the, eighth, army, with, major, general, neil, ritchie, the, german, counterattack, stalled, as, it, outran, its, supplies, and, met, stiffening, resistance, and, was, criticised, by, the, german, high, command, and, some, of, rommel, s, staff, officers, while, rommel, drove, into, egypt, the, remaining, commonwealth, forces, east, of, tobruk, threatened, the, weak, axis, lines, there, unable, to, reach, rommel, for, several, days, rommel, s, chief, of, staff, siegfried, westphal, ordered, the, 21st, panzer, division, to, withdraw, to, support, the, siege, of, tobruk, on, 27, november, the, british, attack, on, tobruk, linked, up, with, the, defenders, and, rommel, having, suffered, losses, that, could, not, easily, be, replaced, had, to, concentrate, on, regrouping, the, divisions, that, had, attacked, into, egypt, by, 7, december, rommel, fell, back, to, a, defensive, line, at, gazala, just, west, of, tobruk, all, the, while, under, heavy, attack, from, the, desert, air, force, the, allies, kept, up, the, pressure, and, rommel, was, forced, to, retreat, all, the, way, back, to, the, starting, positions, he, had, held, in, march, reaching, el, agheila, in, december, 1941, the, british, had, retaken, almost, all, of, cyrenaica, but, rommel, s, retreat, dramatically, shortened, his, supply, lines, on, 5, january, 1942, the, afrika, korps, received, 55, tanks, and, new, supplies, and, rommel, started, planning, a, counterattack, which, he, launched, on, 21, january, caught, by, surprise, the, allies, lost, over, 110, tanks, and, other, heavy, equipment, the, axis, forces, retook, benghazi, on, 29, january, and, timimi, on, 3, february, with, the, allies, pulling, back, to, a, defensive, line, just, before, the, tobruk, area, south, of, the, coastal, town, of, gazala, between, december, 1941, and, june, 1942, rommel, had, excellent, information, about, the, disposition, and, intentions, of, the, commonwealth, forces, bonner, fellers, us, military, attach, in, egypt, was, sending, detailed, reports, to, the, us, state, department, using, a, compromised, code, following, kesselring, s, successes, in, creating, local, air, superiority, around, the, british, naval, and, air, bases, at, malta, in, april, 1942, an, increased, flow, of, supplies, reached, the, axis, forces, in, africa, with, his, forces, strengthened, rommel, contemplated, a, major, offensive, operation, for, the, end, of, may, he, knew, the, british, were, planning, offensive, operations, as, well, and, he, hoped, to, pre, empt, them, early, in, the, afternoon, of, 26, may, 1942, rommel, attacked, first, and, the, battle, of, gazala, commenced, under, the, cover, of, darkness, the, bulk, of, rommel, s, motorised, and, armoured, forces, drove, south, to, skirt, the, left, flank, of, the, british, coming, up, behind, them, and, attacking, to, the, north, the, following, morning, on, 30, may, rommel, resumed, the, offensive, and, on, 1, june, rommel, accepted, the, surrender, of, some, 3, 000, commonwealth, soldiers, on, 6, june, rommel, s, forces, assaulted, the, free, french, strongpoint, in, the, battle, of, bir, hakeim, but, the, defenders, continued, to, thwart, the, attack, until, finally, evacuating, on, 10, june, rommel, then, shifted, his, attack, north, threatened, with, being, completely, cut, off, the, british, began, a, retreat, eastward, toward, egypt, on, 14, june, the, so, called, gazala, gallop, the, assault, on, tobruk, proper, began, at, dawn, on, 20, june, and, the, british, surrendered, at, dawn, the, following, day, rommel, s, forces, captured, 32, 000, commonwealth, troops, the, port, and, huge, quantities, of, supplies, only, at, the, fall, of, singapore, earlier, that, year, had, more, british, commonwealth, troops, been, captured, at, one, time, on, 22, june, hitler, promoted, rommel, to, generalfeldmarschall, for, this, victory, following, his, success, at, gazala, and, tobruk, rommel, wanted, to, seize, the, moment, and, not, allow, the, 8th, army, a, chance, to, regroup, he, strongly, argued, that, the, panzerarmee, should, advance, into, egypt, and, drive, on, to, alexandria, and, the, suez, canal, as, this, would, place, almost, all, the, mediterranean, coastline, in, axis, hands, and, according, to, rommel, potentially, lead, to, the, capture, from, the, south, of, the, oil, fields, in, the, caucasus, and, middle, east, rommel, s, success, at, tobruk, worked, against, him, as, hitler, no, longer, felt, it, was, necessary, to, proceed, with, operation, herkules, the, proposed, attack, on, malta, auchinleck, relieved, ritchie, of, command, of, the, eighth, army, on, 25, june, and, temporarily, took, command, himself, rommel, knew, that, delay, would, only, benefit, the, british, who, continued, to, receive, supplies, at, a, faster, rate, than, rommel, could, hope, to, achieve, he, pressed, an, attack, on, the, heavily, fortified, town, of, mersa, matruh, which, auchinleck, had, designated, as, the, fall, back, position, surrounding, it, on, 28, june, the, fortress, fell, to, the, germans, on, 29, june, in, addition, to, stockpiles, of, fuel, and, other, supplies, the, british, abandoned, hundreds, of, tanks, and, trucks, those, that, were, functional, were, put, into, service, by, the, panzerarmee, which, by, now, relied, on, british, trucks, for, half, its, transport, rommel, continued, his, pursuit, of, the, eighth, army, which, had, fallen, back, to, heavily, prepared, defensive, positions, at, el, alamein, this, region, is, a, natural, choke, point, where, the, qattara, depression, creates, a, relatively, short, line, to, defend, that, could, not, be, outflanked, to, the, south, because, of, the, steep, escarpment, during, this, time, germans, prepared, numerous, propaganda, postcards, and, leaflets, for, the, egyptian, and, syrian, populations, urging, them, to, chase, english, out, of, the, cities, warning, them, about, jewish, peril, and, with, one, leaflet, printed, in, 296, 000, copies, and, aimed, at, syria, stating, among, others, because, marshal, rommel, at, the, head, of, the, brave, axis, troops, is, already, rattling, the, last, gates, of, england, s, power, arabs, help, your, friends, achieve, their, goal, abolishing, the, english, jewish, american, tyranny, on, 1, july, the, first, battle, of, el, alamein, began, rommel, had, around, 100, available, tanks, the, allies, were, able, to, achieve, local, air, superiority, with, heavy, bombers, attacking, the, 15th, and, 21st, panzers, who, had, also, been, delayed, by, a, sandstorm, the, 90th, light, division, veered, off, course, and, were, pinned, down, by, south, african, artillery, fire, rommel, continued, to, attempt, to, advance, for, two, more, days, but, repeated, sorties, by, the, desert, air, force, meant, he, could, make, no, progress, on, 3, july, he, wrote, in, his, diary, that, his, strength, had, faded, away, attacks, by, 21st, panzer, on, 13, and, 14, july, were, repulsed, and, an, australian, attack, on, 16, 17, july, was, held, off, with, difficulty, throughout, the, first, half, of, july, auchinleck, concentrated, attacks, on, the, italian, 60th, infantry, division, sabratha, at, tel, el, eisa, the, ridge, was, captured, by, the, 26th, australian, brigade, on, 16, july, both, sides, suffered, similar, losses, throughout, the, month, but, the, axis, supply, situation, remained, less, favourable, rommel, realised, that, the, tide, was, turning, a, break, in, the, action, took, place, at, the, end, of, july, as, both, sides, rested, and, regrouped, preparing, for, a, renewed, drive, the, british, replaced, auchinleck, with, general, harold, alexander, on, 8, august, bernard, montgomery, was, made, the, new, commander, of, the, eighth, army, that, same, day, the, eighth, army, had, initially, been, assigned, to, general, william, gott, but, he, was, killed, when, his, plane, was, shot, down, on, 7, august, rommel, knew, that, a, british, convoy, carrying, over, 100, 000, tons, of, supplies, was, due, to, arrive, in, september, he, decided, to, launch, an, attack, at, the, end, of, august, with, the, 15th, and, 21st, panzer, division, 90th, light, division, and, the, italian, xx, motorized, corps, in, a, drive, through, the, southern, flank, of, the, el, alamein, lines, expecting, an, attack, sooner, rather, than, later, montgomery, fortified, the, alam, el, halfa, ridge, with, the, 44th, division, and, positioned, the, 7th, armoured, division, about, 25, kilometres, 15, mi, to, the, south, the, battle, of, alam, el, halfa, was, launched, on, 30, august, the, terrain, left, rommel, with, no, choice, but, to, follow, a, similar, tactic, as, he, had, at, previous, battles, the, bulk, of, the, forces, attempted, to, sweep, around, from, the, south, while, secondary, attacks, were, launched, on, the, remainder, of, the, front, it, took, much, longer, than, anticipated, to, get, through, the, minefields, in, the, southern, sector, and, the, tanks, got, bogged, down, in, unexpected, patches, of, quicksand, montgomery, had, arranged, for, rommel, to, acquire, a, falsified, map, of, the, terrain, under, heavy, fire, from, british, artillery, and, aircraft, and, in, the, face, of, well, prepared, positions, that, rommel, could, not, hope, to, outflank, for, lack, of, fuel, the, attack, stalled, by, 2, september, rommel, realised, the, battle, was, unwinnable, and, decided, to, withdraw, on, the, night, of, 3, september, the, 2nd, new, zealand, division, and, 7th, armoured, division, positioned, to, the, north, engaged, in, an, assault, but, they, were, repelled, in, a, fierce, rearguard, action, by, the, 90th, light, division, montgomery, called, off, further, action, to, preserve, his, strength, and, allow, for, further, desert, training, for, his, forces, in, the, attack, rommel, had, suffered, 2, 940, casualties, and, lost, 50, tanks, a, similar, number, of, guns, and, 400, lorries, vital, for, supplies, and, movement, the, british, losses, except, tank, losses, of, 68, were, much, less, further, adding, to, the, numerical, inferiority, of, panzer, army, africa, the, desert, air, force, inflicted, the, highest, proportions, of, damage, on, rommel, s, forces, he, now, realised, the, war, in, africa, could, not, be, won, physically, exhausted, and, suffering, from, a, liver, infection, and, low, blood, pressure, rommel, flew, home, to, germany, to, recover, his, health, general, georg, stumme, was, left, in, command, in, rommel, s, absence, improved, decoding, by, british, intelligence, see, ultra, meant, that, the, allies, had, advance, knowledge, of, virtually, every, mediterranean, convoy, and, only, 30, per, cent, of, shipments, were, getting, through, in, addition, mussolini, diverted, supplies, intended, for, the, front, to, his, garrison, at, tripoli, and, refused, to, release, any, additional, troops, to, rommel, the, increasing, allied, air, superiority, and, lack, of, fuel, meant, rommel, was, forced, to, take, a, more, defensive, posture, than, he, would, have, liked, for, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, the, german, defences, to, the, west, of, the, town, included, a, minefield, eight, kilometres, five, miles, deep, with, the, main, defensive, line, itself, several, thousand, yards, deep, to, its, west, this, rommel, hoped, would, allow, his, infantry, to, hold, the, line, at, any, point, until, motorised, and, armoured, units, in, reserve, could, move, up, and, counterattack, any, allied, breaches, the, british, offensive, began, on, 23, october, stumme, in, command, in, rommel, s, absence, died, of, an, apparent, heart, attack, while, examining, the, front, on, 24, october, and, rommel, was, ordered, to, return, from, his, medical, leave, arriving, on, the, 25th, montgomery, s, intention, was, to, clear, a, narrow, path, through, the, minefield, at, the, northern, part, of, the, defences, at, the, area, called, kidney, ridge, with, a, feint, to, the, south, by, the, end, of, 25, october, the, 15th, panzer, the, defenders, in, this, sector, had, only, 31, serviceable, tanks, remaining, of, their, initial, force, of, 119, rommel, brought, the, 21st, panzer, and, ariete, divisions, north, on, 26, october, to, bolster, the, sector, on, 28, october, montgomery, shifted, his, focus, to, the, coast, ordering, his, 1st, and, 10th, armoured, divisions, to, attempt, to, swing, around, and, cut, off, rommel, s, line, of, retreat, meanwhile, rommel, concentrated, his, attack, on, the, allied, salient, at, kidney, ridge, inflicting, heavy, losses, however, rommel, had, only, 150, operational, tanks, remaining, and, montgomery, had, 800, many, of, them, shermans, montgomery, seeing, his, armoured, brigades, losing, tanks, at, an, alarming, rate, stopped, major, attacks, until, the, early, hours, of, 2, november, when, he, opened, operation, supercharge, with, a, massive, artillery, barrage, due, to, heavy, losses, in, tanks, towards, the, end, of, the, day, rommel, ordered, his, forces, to, disengage, and, begin, to, withdraw, at, midnight, he, informed, the, okw, of, his, decision, and, received, a, reply, directly, from, hitler, the, following, afternoon, he, ordered, rommel, and, his, troops, to, hold, their, position, to, the, last, man, rommel, who, believed, that, the, lives, of, his, soldiers, should, never, be, squandered, needlessly, was, stunned, rommel, initially, complied, with, the, order, but, after, discussions, with, kesselring, and, others, he, issued, orders, for, a, retreat, on, 4, november, the, delay, proved, costly, in, terms, of, his, ability, to, get, his, forces, out, of, egypt, he, later, said, the, decision, to, delay, was, what, he, most, regretted, from, his, time, in, africa, meanwhile, the, british, 1st, and, 7th, armoured, division, had, broken, through, the, german, defences, and, were, preparing, to, swing, north, and, surround, the, axis, forces, on, the, evening, of, the, 4th, rommel, finally, received, word, from, hitler, authorising, the, withdrawal, as, rommel, attempted, to, withdraw, his, forces, before, the, british, could, cut, off, his, retreat, he, fought, a, series, of, delaying, actions, heavy, rains, slowed, movements, and, grounded, the, desert, air, force, which, aided, the, withdrawal, yet, rommel, s, troops, were, under, pressure, from, the, pursuing, eighth, army, and, had, to, abandon, the, trucks, of, the, italian, forces, leaving, them, behind, rommel, continued, to, retreat, west, aiming, for, gabes, gap, in, tunisia, kesselring, strongly, criticised, rommel, s, decision, to, retreat, all, the, way, to, tunisia, as, each, airfield, the, germans, abandoned, extended, the, range, of, the, allied, bombers, and, fighters, rommel, defended, his, decision, pointing, out, that, if, he, tried, to, assume, a, defensive, position, the, allies, would, destroy, his, forces, and, take, the, airfields, anyway, the, retreat, saved, the, lives, of, his, remaining, men, and, shortened, his, supply, lines, by, now, rommel, s, remaining, forces, fought, in, reduced, strength, combat, groups, whereas, the, allied, forces, had, great, numerical, superiority, and, control, of, the, air, on, his, arrival, in, tunisia, rommel, noted, with, some, bitterness, the, reinforcements, including, the, 10th, panzer, division, arriving, in, tunisia, following, the, allied, invasion, of, morocco, having, reached, tunisia, rommel, launched, an, attack, against, the, u, s, ii, corps, which, was, threatening, to, cut, his, lines, of, supply, north, to, tunis, rommel, inflicted, a, sharp, defeat, on, the, american, forces, at, the, kasserine, pass, in, february, his, last, battlefield, victory, of, the, war, and, his, first, engagement, against, the, united, states, army, rommel, immediately, turned, back, against, the, british, forces, occupying, the, mareth, line, old, french, defences, on, the, libyan, border, while, rommel, was, at, kasserine, at, the, end, of, january, 1943, the, italian, general, giovanni, messe, was, appointed, commander, of, panzer, army, africa, renamed, the, italo, german, panzer, army, in, recognition, of, the, fact, that, it, consisted, of, one, german, and, three, italian, corps, though, messe, replaced, rommel, he, diplomatically, deferred, to, him, and, the, two, coexisted, in, what, was, theoretically, the, same, command, on, 23, february, army, group, afrika, was, created, with, rommel, in, command, it, included, the, italo, german, panzer, army, under, messe, renamed, 1st, italian, army, and, the, german, 5th, panzer, army, in, the, north, of, tunisia, under, general, hans, j, rgen, von, arnim, the, last, rommel, offensive, in, north, africa, was, on, 6, march, 1943, when, he, attacked, the, eighth, army, at, the, battle, of, medenine, the, attack, was, made, with, 10th, 15th, and, 21st, panzer, divisions, alerted, by, ultra, intercepts, montgomery, deployed, large, numbers, of, anti, tank, guns, in, the, path, of, the, offensive, after, losing, 52, tanks, rommel, called, off, the, assault, on, 9, march, he, returned, to, germany, command, was, handed, over, to, general, hans, j, rgen, von, arnim, rommel, never, returned, to, africa, the, fighting, there, continued, for, another, two, months, until, 13, may, 1943, when, messe, surrendered, the, army, group, to, the, allies, on, 23, july, 1943, rommel, was, moved, to, greece, as, commander, of, army, group, e, to, counter, a, possible, british, invasion, he, arrived, in, greece, on, 25, july, but, was, recalled, to, berlin, the, same, day, following, mussolini, s, dismissal, from, office, this, caused, the, german, high, command, to, review, the, defensive, integrity, of, the, mediterranean, and, it, was, decided, that, rommel, should, be, posted, to, italy, as, commander, of, the, newly, formed, army, group, b, on, 16, august, 1943, rommel, s, headquarters, moved, to, lake, garda, in, northern, italy, and, he, formally, assumed, command, of, the, group, consisting, of, the, 44th, infantry, division, the, 26th, panzer, division, and, the, 1st, ss, panzer, division, leibstandarte, ss, adolf, hitler, when, italy, announced, its, armistice, with, the, allies, on, 8, september, rommel, s, group, took, part, in, operation, achse, disarming, the, italian, forces, hitler, met, with, rommel, and, kesselring, to, discuss, future, operations, in, italy, on, 30, september, 1943, rommel, insisted, on, a, defensive, line, north, of, rome, while, kesselring, was, more, optimistic, and, advocated, holding, a, line, south, of, rome, hitler, preferred, kesselring, s, recommendation, and, therefore, revoked, his, previous, decision, for, the, subordination, of, kesselring, s, forces, to, rommel, s, army, group, on, 19, october, hitler, decided, that, kesselring, would, be, the, overall, commander, of, the, forces, in, italy, sidelining, rommel, rommel, had, wrongly, predicted, that, the, collapse, of, the, german, line, in, italy, would, be, fast, on, 21, november, hitler, gave, kesselring, overall, command, of, the, italian, theatre, moving, rommel, and, army, group, b, to, normandy, in, france, with, responsibility, for, defending, the, french, coast, against, the, long, anticipated, allied, invasion, on, 4, november, 1943, rommel, became, general, inspector, of, the, western, defences, he, was, given, a, staff, that, befitted, an, army, group, commander, and, the, powers, to, travel, examine, and, make, suggestions, on, how, to, improve, the, defences, hitler, who, was, having, a, disagreement, with, him, over, military, matters, intended, to, use, rommel, as, a, psychological, trump, card, there, was, broad, disagreement, in, the, german, high, command, as, to, how, best, to, meet, the, expected, allied, invasion, of, northern, france, the, commander, in, chief, west, gerd, von, rundstedt, believed, there, was, no, way, to, stop, the, invasion, near, the, beaches, because, of, the, allied, navies, firepower, as, had, been, experienced, at, salerno, he, argued, that, the, german, armour, should, be, held, in, reserve, well, inland, near, paris, where, they, could, be, used, to, counter, attack, in, force, in, a, more, traditional, military, doctrine, the, allies, could, be, allowed, to, extend, themselves, deep, into, france, where, a, battle, for, control, would, be, fought, allowing, the, germans, to, envelop, the, allied, forces, in, a, pincer, movement, cutting, off, their, avenue, of, retreat, he, feared, the, piecemeal, commitment, of, their, armoured, forces, would, cause, them, to, become, caught, in, a, battle, of, attrition, which, they, could, not, hope, to, win, the, notion, of, holding, the, armour, inland, to, use, as, a, mobile, reserve, force, from, which, they, could, mount, a, powerful, counterattack, applied, the, classic, use, of, armoured, formations, as, seen, in, france, in, 1940, these, tactics, were, still, effective, on, the, eastern, front, where, control, of, the, air, was, important, but, did, not, dominate, the, action, rommel, s, own, experiences, at, the, end, of, the, north, african, campaign, revealed, to, him, that, the, germans, would, not, be, able, to, preserve, their, armour, from, air, attack, for, this, type, of, mass, assault, rommel, believed, their, only, opportunity, would, be, to, oppose, the, landings, directly, at, the, beaches, and, to, counterattack, there, before, the, invaders, could, become, well, established, though, there, had, been, some, defensive, positions, established, and, gun, emplacements, made, the, atlantic, wall, was, a, token, defensive, line, rundstedt, had, confided, to, rommel, that, it, was, for, propaganda, purposes, only, upon, arriving, in, northern, france, rommel, was, dismayed, by, the, lack, of, completed, works, according, to, ruge, rommel, was, in, a, staff, position, and, could, not, issue, orders, but, he, made, every, effort, to, explain, his, plan, to, commanders, down, to, the, platoon, level, who, took, up, his, words, eagerly, but, more, or, less, open, opposition, from, the, above, slowed, down, the, process, rundstedt, intervened, and, supported, rommel, s, request, for, being, made, a, commander, it, was, granted, on, 15, january, 1944, he, and, his, staff, set, out, to, improve, the, fortifications, along, the, atlantic, wall, with, great, energy, and, engineering, skill, this, was, a, compromise, rommel, now, commanded, the, 7th, and, 15th, armies, he, also, had, authority, over, a, 20, kilometre, wide, strip, of, coastal, land, between, zuiderzee, and, the, mouth, of, the, loire, the, chain, of, command, was, convoluted, the, air, force, and, navy, had, their, own, chiefs, as, did, the, south, and, southwest, france, and, the, panzer, group, rommel, also, needed, hitler, s, permission, to, use, the, tank, divisions, rommel, had, millions, of, mines, laid, and, thousands, of, tank, traps, and, obstacles, set, up, on, the, beaches, and, throughout, the, countryside, including, in, fields, suitable, for, glider, aircraft, landings, the, so, called, rommel, s, asparagus, the, allies, would, later, counter, these, with, hobart, s, funnies, in, april, 1944, rommel, promised, hitler, that, the, preparations, would, be, complete, by, 1, may, a, promise, he, failed, to, deliver, by, the, time, of, the, allied, invasion, the, preparations, were, far, from, finished, the, quality, of, some, of, the, troops, manning, them, was, poor, and, many, bunkers, lacked, sufficient, stocks, of, ammunition, rundstedt, expected, the, allies, to, invade, in, the, pas, de, calais, because, it, was, the, shortest, crossing, point, from, britain, its, port, facilities, were, essential, to, supplying, a, large, invasion, force, and, the, distance, from, calais, to, germany, was, relatively, short, rommel, and, hitler, s, views, on, the, matter, are, a, matter, of, debate, between, authors, with, both, seeming, to, change, their, positions, hitler, vacillated, between, the, two, strategies, in, late, april, he, ordered, the, i, ss, panzer, corps, placed, near, paris, far, enough, inland, to, be, useless, to, rommel, but, not, far, enough, for, rundstedt, rommel, moved, those, armoured, formations, under, his, command, as, far, forward, as, possible, ordering, general, erich, marcks, commanding, the, 84th, corps, defending, the, normandy, section, to, move, his, reserves, into, the, frontline, rundstedt, was, willing, to, delegate, a, majority, of, the, responsibilities, to, rommel, the, central, reserve, was, rundstedt, s, idea, but, he, did, not, oppose, some, form, of, coastal, defence, rommel, s, strategy, of, an, armour, supported, coastal, defence, line, was, opposed, by, some, officers, most, notably, leo, geyr, von, schweppenburg, who, was, supported, by, guderian, hitler, compromised, and, gave, rommel, three, divisions, the, 2nd, the, 21st, and, the, 116th, panzer, let, rundstedt, retain, four, and, turned, the, other, three, to, army, group, g, pleasing, no, one, the, allies, staged, elaborate, deceptions, for, d, day, see, operation, fortitude, giving, the, impression, that, the, landings, would, be, at, calais, although, hitler, himself, expected, a, normandy, invasion, for, a, while, rommel, and, most, army, commanders, in, france, believed, there, would, be, two, invasions, with, the, main, invasion, coming, at, the, pas, de, calais, rommel, drove, defensive, preparations, all, along, the, coast, of, northern, france, particularly, concentrating, on, fortification, building, in, the, river, somme, estuary, by, d, day, on, 6, june, 1944, nearly, all, the, german, staff, officers, including, hitler, s, staff, believed, that, pas, de, calais, was, going, to, be, the, main, invasion, site, and, continued, to, believe, so, even, after, the, landings, in, normandy, had, occurred, the, 5, june, storm, in, the, channel, seemed, to, make, a, landing, very, unlikely, and, a, number, of, the, senior, officers, left, their, units, for, training, exercises, and, various, other, efforts, on, 4, june, the, chief, meteorologist, of, the, 3, air, fleet, reported, that, weather, in, the, channel, was, so, poor, there, could, be, no, landing, attempted, for, two, weeks, on, 5, june, rommel, left, france, and, on, 6, june, he, was, at, home, celebrating, his, wife, s, 50th, birthday, he, was, recalled, and, returned, to, his, headquarters, at, 10, pm, meanwhile, earlier, in, the, day, rundstedt, had, requested, the, reserves, be, transferred, to, his, command, at, 10, am, keitel, advised, that, hitler, declined, to, release, the, reserves, but, that, rundstedt, could, move, the, 12th, ss, panzer, division, hitlerjugend, closer, to, the, coast, with, the, panzer, lehr, division, placed, on, standby, later, in, the, day, rundstedt, received, authorisation, to, move, additional, units, in, preparation, for, a, counterattack, which, rundstedt, decided, to, launch, on, 7, june, upon, arrival, rommel, concurred, with, the, plan, by, nightfall, rundstedt, rommel, and, speidel, continued, to, believe, that, the, normandy, landing, might, have, been, a, diversionary, attack, as, the, allied, deception, measures, still, pointed, towards, calais, the, 7, june, counterattack, did, not, take, place, because, allied, air, bombardments, prevented, the, 12th, ss, s, timely, arrival, all, this, made, the, german, command, structure, in, france, in, disarray, during, the, opening, hours, of, the, d, day, invasion, the, allies, secured, five, beachheads, by, nightfall, of, 6, june, landing, 155, 000, troops, the, allies, pushed, ashore, and, expanded, their, beachhead, despite, strong, german, resistance, rommel, believed, that, if, his, armies, pulled, out, of, range, of, allied, naval, fire, it, would, give, them, a, chance, to, regroup, and, re, engage, them, later, with, a, better, chance, of, success, while, he, managed, to, convince, rundstedt, they, still, needed, to, win, over, hitler, at, a, meeting, with, hitler, at, his, wolfsschlucht, ii, headquarters, in, margival, in, northern, france, on, 17, june, rommel, warned, hitler, about, the, inevitable, collapse, in, the, german, defences, but, was, rebuffed, and, told, to, focus, on, military, operations, by, mid, july, the, german, position, was, crumbling, on, 17, july, 1944, as, rommel, was, returning, from, visiting, the, headquarters, of, the, i, ss, panzer, corps, a, fighter, plane, piloted, by, either, charley, fox, of, 412, squadron, rcaf, jacques, remlinger, of, no, 602, squadron, raf, or, johannes, jacobus, le, roux, of, no, 602, squadron, raf, strafed, his, staff, car, near, sainte, foy, de, montgommery, the, driver, sped, up, and, attempted, to, get, off, the, main, roadway, but, a, 20, mm, round, shattered, his, left, arm, causing, the, vehicle, to, veer, off, the, road, and, crash, into, trees, rommel, was, thrown, from, the, car, suffering, injuries, to, the, left, side, of, his, face, from, glass, shards, and, three, fractures, to, his, skull, he, was, hospitalised, with, major, head, injuries, assumed, to, be, almost, certainly, fatal, the, role, that, rommel, played, in, the, military, s, resistance, against, hitler, or, the, 20, july, plot, is, difficult, to, ascertain, as, most, of, the, leaders, who, were, directly, involved, did, not, survive, and, limited, documentation, exists, on, the, conspirators, plans, and, preparations, one, piece, of, evidence, that, points, to, the, possibility, that, rommel, came, to, support, the, assassination, plan, was, general, eberbach, s, confession, to, his, son, eavesdropped, on, by, british, agencies, while, in, british, captivity, which, stated, that, rommel, explicitly, said, to, him, that, hitler, and, his, close, associates, had, to, be, killed, because, this, would, be, the, only, way, out, for, germany, this, conversation, occurred, about, a, month, before, rommel, was, coerced, into, suicide, other, notable, evidence, includes, the, papers, of, rudolf, hartmann, who, survived, the, later, purge, and, carl, heinrich, von, st, lpnagel, who, were, among, the, leaders, of, the, military, resistance, alongside, rommel, s, chief, of, staff, general, hans, speidel, colonel, karl, richard, ko, mann, colonel, eberhard, finckh, and, lieutenant, colonel, caesar, von, hofacker, these, papers, accidentally, discovered, by, historian, christian, schweizer, in, 2018, while, doing, research, on, rudolf, hartmann, include, hartmann, s, eyewitness, account, of, a, conversation, between, rommel, and, st, lpnagel, in, may, 1944, as, well, as, photos, of, the, mid, may, 1944, meeting, between, the, inner, circle, of, the, resistance, and, rommel, at, ko, mann, s, house, according, to, hartmann, by, the, end, of, may, in, another, meeting, at, hartmann, s, quarters, in, mareil, marly, rommel, showed, decisive, determination, and, clear, approval, of, the, inner, circle, s, plan, in, a, post, war, account, by, karl, str, lin, three, of, rommel, s, friends, the, oberb, rgermeister, of, stuttgart, str, lin, who, had, served, with, rommel, in, the, first, world, war, alexander, von, falkenhausen, and, st, lpnagel, began, efforts, to, bring, rommel, into, the, anti, hitler, conspiracy, in, early, 1944, according, to, str, lin, sometime, in, february, rommel, agreed, to, lend, his, support, to, the, resistance, on, 15, april, 1944, rommel, s, new, chief, of, staff, hans, speidel, arrived, in, normandy, and, reintroduced, rommel, to, st, lpnagel, speidel, had, previously, been, connected, to, carl, goerdeler, the, civilian, leader, of, the, resistance, but, not, to, the, plotters, led, by, claus, von, stauffenberg, and, came, to, stauffenberg, s, attention, only, upon, his, appointment, to, rommel, s, headquarters, the, conspirators, felt, they, needed, the, support, of, a, field, marshal, on, active, duty, erwin, von, witzleben, who, would, have, become, commander, in, chief, of, the, wehrmacht, had, the, plot, succeeded, was, a, field, marshal, but, had, been, inactive, since, 1942, the, conspirators, gave, instructions, to, speidel, to, bring, rommel, into, their, circle, speidel, met, with, former, foreign, minister, konstantin, von, neurath, and, str, lin, on, 27, may, in, germany, ostensibly, at, rommel, s, request, although, the, latter, was, not, present, neurath, and, str, lin, suggested, opening, immediate, surrender, negotiations, in, the, west, and, according, to, speidel, rommel, agreed, to, further, discussions, and, preparations, around, the, same, timeframe, the, plotters, in, berlin, were, not, aware, that, rommel, had, allegedly, decided, to, take, part, in, the, conspiracy, on, 16, may, they, informed, allen, dulles, through, whom, they, hoped, to, negotiate, with, the, western, allies, that, rommel, could, not, be, counted, on, for, support, at, least, initially, rommel, opposed, assassinating, hitler, according, to, some, authors, he, gradually, changed, his, attitude, after, the, war, his, widow, among, others, maintained, that, rommel, believed, an, assassination, attempt, would, spark, a, civil, war, in, germany, and, austria, and, hitler, would, have, become, a, martyr, for, a, lasting, cause, instead, rommel, reportedly, suggested, that, hitler, be, arrested, and, brought, to, trial, for, his, crimes, he, did, not, attempt, to, implement, this, plan, when, hitler, visited, margival, france, on, 17, june, the, arrest, plan, would, have, been, highly, improbable, as, hitler, s, security, was, extremely, tight, rommel, would, have, known, this, having, commanded, hitler, s, army, protection, detail, in, 1939, he, was, in, favour, of, peace, negotiations, and, repeatedly, urged, hitler, to, negotiate, with, the, allies, which, is, dubbed, by, some, as, hopelessly, naive, considering, no, one, would, trust, hitler, as, naive, as, it, was, idealistic, the, attitude, he, showed, to, the, man, he, had, sworn, loyalty, according, to, reuth, the, reason, lucie, rommel, did, not, want, her, husband, to, be, associated, with, any, conspiracy, was, that, even, after, the, war, the, german, population, neither, grasped, nor, wanted, to, comprehend, the, reality, of, the, genocide, thus, conspirators, were, still, treated, as, traitors, and, outcasts, on, the, other, hand, the, resistance, depended, on, the, reputation, of, rommel, to, win, over, the, population, some, officers, who, had, worked, with, rommel, also, recognised, the, relationship, between, rommel, and, the, resistance, westphal, said, that, rommel, did, not, want, any, more, senseless, sacrifices, butler, using, ruge, s, recollections, reports, that, when, told, by, hitler, himself, that, no, one, will, make, peace, with, me, rommel, told, hitler, that, if, he, was, the, obstacle, to, peace, he, should, resign, or, kill, himself, but, hitler, insisted, on, fanatical, defence, reuth, based, on, jodl, s, testimony, reports, that, rommel, forcefully, presented, the, situation, and, asked, for, political, solutions, from, hitler, who, rebuffed, that, rommel, should, leave, politics, to, him, brighton, comments, that, rommel, seemed, devoted, even, though, he, did, not, have, much, faith, in, hitler, anymore, considering, he, kept, informing, hitler, in, person, and, by, letter, about, his, changing, beliefs, despite, facing, a, military, dilemma, as, well, as, a, personal, struggle, lieb, remarks, that, rommel, s, attitude, in, describing, the, situation, honestly, and, requiring, political, solutions, was, almost, without, precedent, and, contrary, to, the, attitude, of, many, other, generals, remy, comments, that, rommel, put, himself, and, his, family, which, he, had, briefly, considered, evacuating, to, france, but, refrained, from, doing, so, at, risk, for, the, resistance, out, of, a, combination, of, his, concern, for, the, fate, of, germany, his, indignation, at, atrocities, and, the, influence, of, people, around, him, on, 15, july, rommel, wrote, a, letter, to, hitler, giving, him, a, last, chance, to, end, the, hostilities, with, the, western, allies, urging, hitler, to, draw, the, proper, conclusions, without, delay, what, rommel, did, not, know, was, that, the, letter, took, two, weeks, to, reach, hitler, because, of, kluge, s, precautions, various, authors, report, that, many, german, generals, in, normandy, including, some, ss, officers, like, hausser, bittrich, dietrich, a, hard, core, nazi, and, hitler, s, long, time, supporter, and, rommel, s, former, opponent, geyr, von, schweppenburg, pledged, support, to, him, even, against, hitler, s, orders, while, kluge, supported, him, with, much, hesitation, rundstedt, encouraged, rommel, to, carry, out, his, plans, but, refused, to, do, anything, himself, remarking, that, it, had, to, be, a, man, who, was, still, young, and, loved, by, the, people, while, erich, von, manstein, was, also, approached, by, rommel, but, categorically, refused, although, he, did, not, report, them, to, hitler, either, peter, hoffmann, reports, that, he, also, attracted, into, his, orbit, officials, who, had, previously, refused, to, support, the, conspiracy, like, julius, dorpm, ller, and, karl, kaufmann, according, to, russell, a, hart, reliable, details, of, the, conversations, are, now, lost, although, they, certainly, met, on, 17, july, 1944, rommel, was, incapacitated, by, an, allied, air, attack, which, many, authors, describe, as, a, fateful, event, that, drastically, altered, the, outcome, of, the, bomb, plot, writer, ernst, j, nger, commented, the, blow, that, felled, rommel, robbed, the, plan, of, the, shoulders, that, were, to, be, entrusted, the, double, weight, of, war, and, civil, war, the, only, man, who, had, enough, naivety, to, counter, the, simple, terror, that, those, he, was, about, to, go, against, possessed, after, the, failed, bomb, attack, of, 20, july, many, conspirators, were, arrested, and, the, dragnet, expanded, to, thousands, rommel, was, first, implicated, when, st, lpnagel, after, his, suicide, attempt, repeatedly, muttered, rommel, in, delirium, under, torture, hofacker, named, rommel, as, one, of, the, participants, additionally, goerdeler, had, written, down, rommel, s, name, on, a, list, as, potential, reich, president, according, to, stroelin, they, had, not, managed, to, announce, this, intention, to, rommel, yet, and, he, probably, never, heard, of, it, until, the, end, of, his, life, on, 27, september, martin, bormann, submitted, to, hitler, a, memorandum, which, claimed, that, the, late, general, st, lpnagel, colonel, hofacker, kluge, s, nephew, who, has, been, executed, lieutenant, colonel, rathgens, and, several, living, defendants, have, testified, that, field, marshal, rommel, was, perfectly, in, the, picture, about, the, assassination, plan, and, has, promised, to, be, at, the, disposal, of, the, new, government, gestapo, agents, were, sent, to, rommel, s, house, in, ulm, and, placed, him, under, surveillance, historian, peter, lieb, considers, the, memorandum, as, well, as, eberbach, s, conversation, and, the, testimonies, of, surviving, resistance, members, including, hartmann, to, be, the, three, key, sources, that, indicate, rommel, s, support, of, the, assassination, plan, he, further, notes, that, while, speidel, had, an, interest, in, promoting, his, own, post, war, career, his, testimonies, should, not, be, dismissed, considering, his, bravery, as, an, early, resistance, figure, remy, writes, that, even, more, important, than, rommel, s, attitude, to, the, assassination, is, the, fact, rommel, had, his, own, plan, to, end, the, war, he, began, to, contemplate, this, plan, some, months, after, el, alamein, and, carried, it, out, with, a, lonely, decision, and, conviction, and, in, the, end, had, managed, to, bring, military, leaders, in, the, west, to, his, side, rommel, s, case, was, turned, over, to, the, court, of, military, honour, a, drumhead, court, martial, convened, to, decide, the, fate, of, officers, involved, in, the, conspiracy, the, court, included, generalfeldmarschall, wilhelm, keitel, generalfeldmarschall, gerd, von, rundstedt, generaloberst, heinz, guderian, general, der, infanterie, walther, schroth, and, generalleutnant, karl, wilhelm, specht, with, general, der, infanterie, karl, kriebel, and, generalleutnant, heinrich, kirchheim, whom, rommel, had, fired, after, tobruk, in, 1941, as, deputy, members, and, generalmajor, ernst, maisel, as, protocol, officer, the, court, acquired, information, from, speidel, hofacker, and, others, that, implicated, rommel, with, keitel, and, ernst, kaltenbrunner, assuming, that, he, had, taken, part, in, the, subversion, keitel, and, guderian, then, made, the, decision, that, favoured, speidel, s, case, and, at, the, same, time, shifted, the, blame, to, rommel, by, normal, procedure, this, would, lead, to, rommel, s, being, brought, to, roland, freisler, s, people, s, court, a, kangaroo, court, that, always, decided, in, favour, of, the, prosecution, however, hitler, knew, that, having, rommel, branded, and, executed, as, a, traitor, would, severely, damage, morale, on, the, home, front, he, thus, decided, to, offer, rommel, the, chance, to, take, his, own, life, two, generals, from, hitler, s, headquarters, wilhelm, burgdorf, and, ernst, maisel, visited, rommel, at, his, home, on, 14, october, 1944, burgdorf, informed, him, of, the, charges, against, him, and, offered, him, three, options, a, he, could, choose, to, defend, himself, personally, in, front, of, hitler, in, berlin, or, he, could, refuse, to, do, so, but, having, done, so, would, be, taken, as, an, admission, of, guilt, b, he, could, face, the, people, s, court, which, would, have, been, tantamount, to, a, death, sentence, or, c, choose, death, by, suicide, in, the, former, case, b, his, family, would, have, suffered, even, before, the, all, but, certain, conviction, and, execution, and, his, staff, would, have, been, arrested, and, executed, as, well, in, the, latter, case, c, the, government, would, claim, that, he, died, a, hero, and, bury, him, with, full, military, honours, and, his, family, would, receive, full, pension, payments, in, support, of, the, suicide, option, burgdorf, had, brought, a, cyanide, capsule, rommel, chose, suicide, and, explained, his, decision, to, his, wife, and, son, wearing, his, afrika, korps, jacket, and, carrying, his, field, marshal, s, baton, he, got, into, burgdorf, s, car, driven, by, ss, stabsscharf, hrer, heinrich, doose, and, was, driven, out, of, the, village, after, stopping, doose, and, maisel, walked, away, from, the, car, leaving, rommel, with, burgdorf, five, minutes, later, burgdorf, gestured, to, the, two, men, to, return, to, the, car, and, doose, noticed, that, rommel, was, slumped, over, having, taken, the, cyanide, he, died, before, being, taken, to, the, wagner, schule, field, hospital, ten, minutes, later, the, group, telephoned, rommel, s, wife, to, inform, her, of, his, death, the, official, notice, of, rommel, s, death, as, reported, to, the, public, stated, that, he, had, died, of, either, a, heart, attack, or, a, cerebral, embolism, a, complication, of, the, skull, fractures, he, had, suffered, in, the, earlier, strafing, of, his, staff, car, to, strengthen, the, story, hitler, ordered, an, official, day, of, mourning, in, commemoration, of, his, death, as, promised, rommel, was, given, a, state, funeral, but, it, was, held, in, ulm, instead, of, berlin, as, had, been, requested, by, rommel, hitler, sent, field, marshal, rundstedt, who, was, unaware, that, rommel, had, died, as, a, result, of, hitler, s, orders, as, his, representative, to, the, funeral, the, truth, behind, rommel, s, death, became, known, to, the, allies, when, intelligence, officer, charles, marshall, interviewed, rommel, s, widow, lucia, rommel, as, well, as, from, a, letter, by, rommel, s, son, manfred, in, april, 1945, rommel, s, grave, is, located, in, herrlingen, a, short, distance, west, of, ulm, for, decades, after, the, war, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, veterans, of, the, africa, campaign, including, former, opponents, would, gather, at, his, tomb, in, herrlingen, on, the, italian, front, in, the, first, world, war, rommel, was, a, successful, tactician, in, fast, developing, mobile, battle, and, this, shaped, his, subsequent, style, as, a, military, commander, he, found, that, taking, initiative, and, not, allowing, the, enemy, forces, to, regroup, led, to, victory, some, authors, argue, that, his, enemies, were, often, less, organised, second, rate, or, depleted, and, his, tactics, were, less, effective, against, adequately, led, trained, and, supplied, opponents, and, proved, insufficient, in, the, later, years, of, the, war, others, point, out, that, through, his, career, he, frequently, fought, while, outnumbered, and, outgunned, sometimes, overwhelmingly, so, while, having, to, deal, with, internal, opponents, in, germany, who, hoped, that, he, would, fail, rommel, is, praised, by, numerous, authors, as, a, great, leader, of, men, the, historian, and, journalist, basil, liddell, hart, concludes, that, he, was, a, strong, leader, worshipped, by, his, troops, respected, by, his, adversaries, and, deserving, to, be, named, as, one, of, the, great, captains, of, history, owen, connelly, concurs, writing, that, no, better, exemplar, of, military, leadership, can, be, found, and, quoting, friedrich, von, mellenthin, on, the, inexplicable, mutual, understanding, that, existed, between, rommel, and, his, troops, hitler, though, remarked, that, unfortunately, field, marshal, rommel, is, a, very, great, leader, full, of, drive, in, times, of, success, but, an, absolute, pessimist, when, he, meets, the, slightest, problems, telp, criticises, rommel, for, not, extending, the, benevolence, he, showed, in, promoting, his, own, officers, careers, to, his, peers, whom, he, ignored, or, slighted, in, his, reports, taking, his, opponents, by, surprise, and, creating, uncertainty, in, their, minds, were, key, elements, in, rommel, s, approach, to, offensive, warfare, he, took, advantage, of, sand, storms, and, the, dark, of, night, to, conceal, the, movement, of, his, forces, he, was, aggressive, and, often, directed, the, battle, from, the, front, or, piloted, a, reconnaissance, aircraft, over, the, lines, to, get, a, view, of, the, situation, when, the, british, mounted, a, commando, raid, deep, behind, german, lines, in, an, effort, to, kill, rommel, and, his, staff, on, the, eve, of, their, crusader, offensive, rommel, was, indignant, that, the, british, expected, to, find, his, headquarters, 400, kilometres, 250, miles, behind, his, front, mellenthin, and, harald, kuhn, write, that, at, times, in, north, africa, his, absence, from, a, position, of, communication, made, command, of, the, battles, of, the, afrika, korps, difficult, mellenthin, lists, rommel, s, counterattack, during, operation, crusader, as, one, such, instance, butler, concurred, saying, that, leading, from, the, front, is, a, good, concept, but, rommel, took, it, so, far, he, frequently, directed, the, actions, of, a, single, company, or, battalion, that, he, made, communication, and, coordination, between, units, problematic, as, well, as, risking, his, life, to, the, extent, that, he, could, easily, have, been, killed, even, by, his, own, artillery, albert, kesselring, also, complained, about, rommel, cruising, about, the, battlefield, like, a, division, or, corps, commander, but, gause, and, westphal, supporting, rommel, replied, that, in, the, african, desert, only, this, method, would, work, and, that, it, was, useless, to, try, to, restrain, rommel, anyway, his, staff, officers, although, admiring, towards, their, leader, complained, about, the, self, destructive, spartan, lifestyle, that, made, life, harder, diminished, his, effectiveness, and, forced, them, to, bab, him, as, unobtrusively, as, possible, for, his, leadership, during, the, french, campaign, rommel, received, both, praise, and, criticism, many, such, as, general, georg, stumme, who, had, previously, commanded, the, 7th, panzer, division, were, impressed, with, the, speed, and, success, of, rommel, s, drive, others, were, reserved, or, critical, kluge, his, commanding, officer, argued, that, rommel, s, decisions, were, impulsive, and, that, he, claimed, too, much, credit, by, falsifying, diagrams, or, by, not, acknowledging, contributions, of, other, units, especially, the, luftwaffe, some, pointed, out, that, rommel, s, division, took, the, highest, casualties, in, the, campaign, others, point, out, that, in, exchange, for, 2, 160, casualties, and, 42, tanks, it, captured, more, than, 100, 000, prisoners, and, destroyed, nearly, two, divisions, worth, of, enemy, tanks, about, 450, tanks, vehicles, and, guns, rommel, spoke, german, with, a, pronounced, southern, german, or, swabian, accent, he, was, not, a, part, of, the, prussian, aristocracy, that, dominated, the, german, high, command, and, as, such, was, looked, upon, somewhat, suspiciously, by, the, wehrmacht, s, traditional, power, structure, rommel, felt, a, commander, should, be, physically, more, robust, than, the, troops, he, led, and, should, always, show, them, an, example, he, expected, his, subordinate, commanders, to, do, the, same, rommel, was, direct, unbending, tough, in, his, manners, to, superiors, and, subordinates, alike, and, disobedient, even, to, hitler, whenever, he, saw, fit, although, gentle, and, diplomatic, to, the, lower, ranks, despite, being, publicity, friendly, he, was, also, shy, introverted, clumsy, and, overly, formal, even, to, his, closest, aides, judging, people, only, on, their, merits, although, loyal, and, considerate, to, those, who, had, proved, reliability, and, he, displayed, a, surprisingly, passionate, and, devoted, side, to, a, very, small, few, including, hitler, with, whom, he, had, dropped, the, seemingly, impenetrable, barriers, rommel, s, relationship, with, the, italian, high, command, in, north, africa, was, generally, poor, although, he, was, nominally, subordinate, to, the, italians, he, enjoyed, a, certain, degree, of, autonomy, from, them, since, he, was, directing, their, troops, in, battle, as, well, as, his, own, this, was, bound, to, cause, hostility, among, italian, commanders, conversely, as, the, italian, command, had, control, over, the, supplies, of, the, forces, in, africa, they, resupplied, italian, units, preferentially, which, was, a, source, of, resentment, for, rommel, and, his, staff, rommel, s, direct, and, abrasive, manner, did, nothing, to, smooth, these, issues, while, certainly, much, less, proficient, than, rommel, in, their, leadership, aggression, tactical, outlook, and, mobile, warfare, skills, italian, commanders, were, competent, in, logistics, strategy, and, artillery, doctrine, their, troops, were, ill, equipped, but, well, trained, as, such, the, italian, commanders, were, repeatedly, at, odds, with, rommel, over, concerns, with, issues, of, supply, field, marshal, kesselring, was, assigned, supreme, commander, mediterranean, at, least, in, part, to, alleviate, command, problems, between, rommel, and, the, italians, this, effort, resulted, only, in, partial, success, with, kesselring, s, own, relationship, with, the, italians, being, unsteady, and, kesselring, claiming, rommel, ignored, him, as, readily, as, he, ignored, the, italians, rommel, often, went, directly, to, hitler, with, his, needs, and, concerns, taking, advantage, of, the, favouritism, that, the, f, hrer, displayed, towards, him, and, adding, to, the, distrust, that, kesselring, and, the, german, high, command, already, had, of, him, according, to, scianna, the, opinion, among, the, italian, military, leaders, was, not, unanimous, in, general, rommel, was, a, target, of, criticism, and, a, scapegoat, for, defeat, rather, than, a, glorified, figure, with, certain, generals, also, trying, to, replace, him, as, the, heroic, leader, or, hijack, the, rommel, myth, for, their, own, benefit, nevertheless, he, never, became, a, hated, figure, although, the, abandonment, myth, despite, being, repudiated, by, officers, of, the, x, corps, themselves, was, long, lived, many, found, rommel, s, chaotic, leadership, and, emotional, character, hard, to, work, with, yet, the, italians, held, him, in, higher, regard, than, other, german, senior, commanders, militarily, and, personally, very, different, however, was, the, perception, of, rommel, by, italian, common, soldiers, and, ncos, who, like, the, german, field, troops, had, the, deepest, trust, and, respect, for, him, paolo, colacicchi, an, officer, in, the, italian, tenth, army, recalled, that, rommel, became, sort, of, a, myth, to, the, italian, soldiers, rommel, himself, held, a, much, more, generous, view, about, the, italian, soldier, than, about, their, leadership, towards, whom, his, disdain, deeply, rooted, in, militarism, was, not, atypical, although, unlike, kesselring, he, was, incapable, of, concealing, it, unlike, many, of, his, superiors, and, subordinates, who, held, racist, views, he, was, usually, kindly, disposed, to, the, italians, in, general, james, j, sadkovich, cites, examples, of, rommel, abandoning, his, italian, units, refusing, cooperation, rarely, acknowledging, their, achievements, and, other, improper, behaviour, towards, his, italian, allies, giuseppe, mancinelli, who, was, the, liaison, between, german, and, italian, command, accused, rommel, of, blaming, italians, for, his, own, errors, sadkovich, names, rommel, as, arrogantly, ethnocentric, and, disdainful, towards, italians, many, authors, describe, rommel, as, having, a, reputation, of, being, a, chivalrous, humane, and, professional, officer, and, that, he, earned, the, respect, of, both, his, own, troops, and, his, enemies, gerhard, schreiber, quotes, rommel, s, orders, issued, together, with, kesselring, sentimentality, concerning, the, badoglio, following, gangs, banden, in, the, original, indicating, a, mob, like, crowd, in, the, uniforms, of, the, former, ally, is, misplaced, whoever, fights, against, the, german, soldier, has, lost, any, right, to, be, treated, well, and, shall, experience, toughness, reserved, for, the, rabble, which, betrays, friends, every, member, of, the, german, troop, has, to, adopt, this, stance, schreiber, writes, that, this, is, exceptionally, harsh, and, according, to, him, hate, fuelled, order, brutalised, the, war, and, was, clearly, aimed, at, italian, soldiers, not, just, partisans, dennis, showalter, writes, that, rommel, was, not, involved, in, italy, s, partisan, war, though, the, orders, he, issued, prescribing, death, for, italian, soldiers, taken, in, arms, and, italian, civilians, sheltering, escaped, british, prisoners, do, not, suggest, he, would, have, behaved, significantly, different, from, his, wehrmacht, counterparts, according, to, maurice, remy, orders, issued, by, hitler, during, rommel, s, stay, in, a, hospital, resulted, in, massacres, in, the, course, of, operation, achse, disarming, the, italian, forces, after, the, armistice, with, the, allies, in, 1943, remy, also, states, that, rommel, treated, his, italian, opponents, with, his, usual, fairness, requiring, that, the, prisoners, should, be, accorded, the, same, conditions, as, german, civilians, remy, opines, that, an, order, in, which, rommel, in, contrast, to, hitler, s, directives, called, for, no, sentimental, scruples, against, badoglio, dependent, bandits, in, uniforms, of, the, once, brothers, in, arms, should, not, be, taken, out, of, context, peter, lieb, agrees, that, the, order, did, not, radicalise, the, war, and, that, the, disarmament, in, rommel, s, area, of, responsibility, happened, without, major, bloodshed, italian, internees, were, sent, to, germany, for, forced, labour, but, rommel, was, unaware, of, this, klaus, schmider, comments, that, the, writings, of, lieb, and, others, succeed, in, vindicating, rommel, both, with, regards, to, his, likely, complicity, in, the, july, plot, as, well, as, his, repeated, refusal, to, carry, out, illegal, orders, rommel, withheld, hitler, s, commando, order, to, execute, captured, commandos, from, his, army, group, b, with, his, units, reporting, that, they, were, treating, commandos, as, regular, pows, it, is, likely, that, he, had, acted, similarly, in, north, africa, historian, szymon, datner, argues, that, rommel, may, have, been, simply, trying, to, conceal, the, atrocities, of, nazi, germany, from, the, allies, remy, states, that, although, rommel, had, heard, rumours, about, massacres, while, fighting, in, africa, his, personality, combined, with, special, circumstances, meant, that, he, was, not, fully, confronted, with, the, reality, of, atrocities, before, 1944, when, rommel, learned, about, the, atrocities, that, ss, division, leibstandarte, committed, in, italy, in, september, 1943, he, allegedly, forbade, his, son, from, joining, the, waffen, ss, by, the, time, of, the, second, world, war, french, colonial, troops, were, portrayed, as, a, symbol, of, french, depravity, in, nazi, propaganda, canadian, historian, myron, echenberg, writes, that, rommel, just, like, hitler, viewed, black, french, soldiers, with, particular, disdain, according, to, author, ward, rutherford, rommel, also, held, racist, views, towards, british, colonial, troops, from, india, rutherford, in, his, the, biography, of, field, marshal, erwin, rommel, writes, not, even, his, most, sycophantic, apologists, have, been, able, to, evade, the, conclusion, fully, demonstrated, by, his, later, behaviour, that, rommel, was, a, racist, who, for, example, thought, it, desperately, unfair, that, the, british, should, employ, black, by, which, he, meant, indian, troops, against, a, white, adversary, vaughn, raspberry, writes, that, rommel, and, other, officers, considered, it, an, insult, to, fight, against, black, africans, because, they, considered, black, people, to, be, members, of, inferior, races, bruce, watson, comments, that, whatever, racism, rommel, might, have, had, in, the, beginning, it, was, washed, away, when, he, fought, in, the, desert, when, he, saw, that, they, were, fighting, well, he, gave, the, members, of, the, 4th, division, of, the, indian, army, high, praise, rommel, and, the, germans, acknowledge, the, gurkhas, fighting, ability, although, their, style, leaned, more, towards, ferocity, once, he, witnessed, german, soldiers, with, throats, cut, by, a, khukri, knife, originally, he, did, not, want, chandra, bose, s, indian, formation, composed, of, the, allied, indian, soldiers, captured, by, his, own, troops, to, work, under, his, command, in, normandy, though, when, they, had, already, become, the, indische, freiwilligen, legion, der, waffen, ss, he, visited, them, and, praised, them, for, their, efforts, while, they, still, suffered, general, disrespect, within, the, wehrmacht, a, review, on, rutherford, s, book, by, the, pakistan, army, journal, says, that, the, statement, is, one, of, many, that, rutherford, uses, which, lack, support, in, authority, and, analysis, rommel, saying, that, using, the, indians, was, unfair, should, also, be, put, in, perspective, considering, the, disbandment, of, the, battle, hardened, 4th, division, by, the, allies, rommel, praised, the, colonial, troops, in, the, battle, of, france, the, french, colonial, troops, fought, with, extraordinary, determination, the, anti, tank, teams, and, tank, crews, performed, with, courage, and, caused, serious, losses, though, that, might, be, an, example, of, generals, honouring, their, opponents, so, that, their, own, victories, appear, the, more, impressive, reuth, comments, that, rommel, ensured, that, he, and, his, command, would, act, decently, shown, by, his, treatment, of, the, free, french, prisoners, who, were, considered, partisans, by, hitler, the, jews, and, the, coloured, men, while, he, was, distancing, himself, from, hitler, s, racist, war, in, the, east, and, deluding, himself, into, believing, that, hitler, was, good, only, the, party, big, shots, were, evil, the, black, south, african, soldiers, recount, that, when, they, were, held, as, pows, after, they, were, captured, by, rommel, they, initially, slept, and, queued, for, food, away, from, the, whites, until, rommel, saw, this, and, told, them, that, brave, soldiers, should, all, queue, together, finding, this, strange, coming, from, a, man, fighting, for, hitler, they, adopted, this, behaviour, until, they, went, back, to, the, union, of, south, africa, where, they, were, separated, again, there, are, reports, that, rommel, acknowledged, the, maori, soldiers, fighting, skills, yet, at, the, same, time, he, complained, about, their, methods, which, were, unfair, from, the, european, perspective, when, he, asked, the, commander, of, the, new, zealand, 6th, infantry, brigade, about, his, division, s, massacres, of, the, wounded, and, pows, the, commander, attributed, these, incidents, to, the, maoris, in, his, unit, hew, strachan, notes, that, lapses, in, practising, the, warriors, code, of, war, were, usually, attributed, to, ethnic, groups, which, lived, outside, europe, with, the, implication, that, those, ethnic, groups, which, lived, in, europe, knew, how, to, behave, although, strachan, opines, that, such, attributions, were, probably, true, nevertheless, according, to, the, website, of, the, 28th, maori, battalion, rommel, always, treated, them, fairly, and, he, also, showed, understanding, with, regard, to, war, crimes, some, authors, cite, among, other, cases, rommel, s, naive, reaction, to, events, in, poland, while, he, was, there, he, paid, a, visit, to, his, wife, s, uncle, famous, polish, priest, and, patriotic, leader, edmund, roszczynialski, who, was, murdered, within, days, but, rommel, never, understood, this, and, at, his, wife, s, urgings, kept, writing, letter, after, letter, to, himmler, s, adjutants, asking, them, to, keep, track, and, take, care, of, their, relative, knopp, and, mosier, agree, that, he, was, naive, politically, citing, his, request, for, a, jewish, gauleiter, in, 1943, despite, this, lieb, finds, it, hard, to, believe, that, a, man, in, rommel, s, position, could, have, known, nothing, about, atrocities, while, accepting, that, locally, he, was, separated, from, the, places, where, these, atrocities, occurred, der, spiegel, comments, that, rommel, was, simply, in, denial, about, what, happened, around, him, alaric, searle, points, out, that, it, was, the, early, diplomatic, successes, and, bloodless, expansion, that, blinded, rommel, to, the, true, nature, of, his, beloved, f, hrer, whom, he, then, naively, continued, to, support, scheck, believes, it, may, be, forever, unclear, whether, rommel, recognised, the, unprecedented, depraved, character, of, the, regime, historian, richard, j, evans, has, stated, that, german, soldiers, in, tunisia, raped, jewish, women, and, the, success, of, rommel, s, forces, in, capturing, or, securing, allied, italian, and, vichy, french, territory, in, north, africa, led, to, many, jews, in, these, areas, being, killed, by, other, german, institutions, as, part, of, the, holocaust, anti, jewish, and, anti, arab, violence, erupted, in, north, africa, when, rommel, and, ettore, bastico, regained, territory, there, in, february, 1941, and, then, again, in, april, 1942, while, committed, by, italian, forces, patrick, bernhard, writes, the, germans, were, aware, of, italian, reprisals, behind, the, front, lines, yet, perhaps, surprisingly, they, seem, to, have, exercised, little, control, over, events, the, german, consul, general, in, tripoli, consulted, with, italian, state, and, party, officials, about, possible, countermeasures, against, the, natives, but, this, was, the, full, extent, of, german, involvement, rommel, did, not, directly, intervene, though, he, advised, the, italian, authorities, to, do, whatever, was, necessary, to, eliminate, the, danger, of, riots, and, espionage, for, the, german, general, the, rear, areas, were, to, be, kept, quiet, at, all, costs, thus, according, to, bernhard, although, he, had, no, direct, hand, in, the, atrocities, rommel, made, himself, complicit, in, war, crimes, by, failing, to, point, out, that, international, laws, of, war, strictly, prohibited, certain, forms, of, retaliation, by, giving, carte, blanche, to, the, italians, rommel, implicitly, condoned, and, perhaps, even, encouraged, their, war, crimes, gershom, reports, that, the, recommendation, came, from, officers, speaking, for, rommel, and, comments, perhaps, rommel, did, not, know, or, care, about, the, specifics, perhaps, his, motivation, was, not, hate, but, dispassionate, efficiency, the, distinctions, would, have, escaped, the, men, hanging, from, hooks, in, his, article, im, r, cken, rommels, kriegsverbrechen, koloniale, massengewalt, und, judenverfolgung, in, nordafrika, bernhard, writes, that, north, african, campaign, was, hardly, war, without, hate, as, rommel, described, it, and, points, out, rapes, of, women, ill, treatment, and, executions, of, captured, pows, as, well, as, racially, motivated, murders, of, arabs, berbers, and, jews, in, addition, to, the, establishment, of, concentration, camps, bernhard, again, cites, discussion, among, the, german, and, italian, authorities, about, rommel, s, position, regarding, countermeasures, against, local, insurrection, according, to, them, rommel, wanted, to, eliminate, the, danger, at, all, costs, to, show, that, rommel, fundamentally, approved, of, italian, policy, in, the, matter, bernhard, opines, that, rommel, had, informal, power, over, the, matter, because, his, military, success, brought, him, influence, on, the, italian, authorities, united, states, holocaust, memorial, museum, describes, relationship, between, rommel, and, the, proposed, einsatzgruppen, egypt, as, problematic, the, museum, states, that, this, unit, was, to, be, tasked, with, murdering, the, jewish, population, of, north, africa, and, palestine, and, it, was, to, be, attached, directly, to, rommel, s, afrika, korps, according, to, the, museum, rauff, met, with, rommel, s, staff, in, 1942, as, part, of, preparations, for, this, plan, the, museum, states, that, rommel, was, certainly, aware, that, planning, was, taking, place, even, if, his, reaction, to, it, isn, t, recorded, and, while, the, main, proposed, einsatzgruppen, were, never, set, in, action, smaller, units, did, murder, jews, in, north, africa, on, the, other, hand, christopher, gabel, remarks, that, richards, evans, seems, to, attempt, to, prove, that, rommel, was, a, war, criminal, by, association, but, fails, to, produce, evidence, that, he, had, actual, or, constructive, knowledge, about, said, crimes, ben, h, shepherd, comments, that, rommel, showed, insight, and, restraint, when, dealing, with, the, nomadic, arabs, the, only, civilians, who, occasionally, intervened, in, the, war, and, thus, risked, reprisals, as, a, result, shepherd, cites, a, request, by, rommel, to, the, italian, high, command, in, which, he, complained, about, excesses, against, the, arabic, population, and, noted, that, reprisals, without, identifying, the, real, culprits, were, never, expedient, the, documentary, rommel, s, war, rommels, krieg, made, by, caron, and, m, llner, with, advice, from, s, nke, neitzel, states, that, even, though, it, is, not, clear, whether, rommel, knew, about, the, crimes, in, africa, or, not, his, military, success, made, possible, forced, labour, torture, and, robbery, rommel, s, war, is, always, part, of, hitler, s, war, of, worldviews, whether, rommel, wanted, it, or, not, more, specifically, several, german, historians, have, revealed, the, existence, of, plans, to, exterminate, jews, in, egypt, and, palestine, if, rommel, had, succeeded, in, his, goal, of, invading, the, middle, east, during, 1942, by, ss, unit, embedded, to, afrika, korps, according, to, mallmann, and, c, ppers, a, post, war, cia, report, described, rommel, as, having, met, with, walther, rauff, who, was, responsible, for, the, unit, and, been, disgusted, after, learning, about, the, plan, from, him, and, as, having, sent, him, on, his, way, but, they, conclude, that, such, a, meeting, is, hardly, possible, as, rauff, was, sent, to, report, to, rommel, at, tobruk, on, 20, july, and, rommel, was, then, 500, km, away, conducting, the, first, el, alamein, on, 29, july, rauff, s, unit, was, sent, to, athens, expecting, to, enter, africa, when, rommel, crossed, the, nile, however, in, view, of, the, axis, deteriorating, situation, in, africa, it, returned, to, germany, in, september, historian, jean, christoph, caron, opines, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, rommel, knew, or, would, have, supported, rauff, s, mission, he, also, believes, rommel, bore, no, direct, responsibility, regarding, the, ss, s, looting, of, gold, in, tunisia, historian, haim, saadon, director, of, the, center, of, research, on, north, african, jewry, in, wwii, goes, further, stating, that, there, was, no, extermination, plan, rauff, s, documents, show, that, his, foremost, concern, was, helping, the, wehrmacht, to, win, and, he, came, up, with, the, idea, of, forced, labour, camps, in, the, process, by, the, time, these, labour, camps, were, in, operation, according, to, ben, h, shepherd, rommel, had, already, been, retreating, and, there, is, no, proof, of, his, contact, with, the, einsatzkommando, haaretz, comments, that, the, cia, report, is, most, likely, correct, regarding, both, the, interaction, between, rommel, and, rauff, and, rommel, s, objections, to, the, plan, rauff, s, assistant, theodor, saevecke, and, declassified, information, from, rauff, s, file, both, report, the, same, story, haaretz, also, remarks, that, rommel, s, influence, probably, softened, the, nazi, authorities, attitude, to, the, jews, and, to, the, civilian, population, generally, in, north, africa, rolf, dieter, m, ller, comments, that, the, war, in, north, africa, while, as, bloody, as, any, other, war, differed, considerably, from, the, war, of, annihilation, in, eastern, europe, because, it, was, limited, to, a, narrow, coastline, and, hardly, affected, the, population, showalter, writes, that, from, the, desert, campaign, s, beginning, both, sides, consciously, sought, to, wage, a, clean, war, war, without, hate, as, rommel, put, it, in, his, reflections, explanations, include, the, absence, of, civilians, and, the, relative, absence, of, nazis, the, nature, of, the, environment, which, conveyed, a, moral, simplicity, and, transparency, and, the, control, of, command, on, both, sides, by, prewar, professionals, producing, a, british, tendency, to, depict, war, in, the, imagery, of, a, game, and, the, corresponding, german, pattern, of, seeing, it, as, a, test, of, skill, and, a, proof, of, virtue, the, nature, of, the, fighting, as, well, diminished, the, last, ditch, close, quarter, actions, that, are, primary, nurturers, of, mutual, bitterness, a, battalion, overrun, by, tanks, usually, had, its, resistance, broken, so, completely, that, nothing, was, to, be, gained, by, a, broken, backed, final, stand, joachim, k, ppner, writes, that, while, the, conflict, in, north, africa, was, not, as, bloody, as, in, eastern, europe, the, afrika, korps, committed, some, war, crimes, historian, martin, kitchen, states, that, the, reputation, of, the, afrika, korps, was, preserved, by, circumstances, the, sparsely, populated, desert, areas, did, not, lend, themselves, to, ethnic, cleansing, the, german, forces, never, reached, the, large, jewish, populations, in, egypt, and, palestine, and, in, the, urban, areas, of, tunisia, and, tripolitania, the, italian, government, constrained, the, german, efforts, to, discriminate, against, or, eliminate, jews, who, were, italian, citizens, despite, this, the, north, african, jews, themselves, believed, that, it, was, rommel, who, prevented, the, final, solution, from, being, carried, out, against, them, when, germany, might, dominate, north, africa, from, egypt, to, morocco, according, to, curtis, and, remy, 120, 000, jews, lived, in, algeria, 200, 000, in, morocco, about, 80, 000, in, tunisia, remy, writes, that, this, number, was, unchanged, following, the, german, invasion, of, tunisia, in, 1942, while, curtis, notes, that, 5000, of, these, jews, would, be, sent, to, forced, labour, camps, and, 26, 000, in, libya, hein, klemann, writes, that, the, confiscations, in, the, foraging, zone, of, afrika, korps, threatened, the, survival, chances, of, local, civilians, just, as, plunder, enacted, by, the, wehrmacht, in, the, soviet, union, in, north, africa, rommel, s, troops, laid, down, landmines, which, in, decades, to, come, killed, and, maimed, thousands, of, civilians, since, statistics, started, in, the, 1980s, 3, 300, people, have, lost, their, lives, and, 7, 500, maimed, there, are, disputed, whether, the, landmines, in, el, alamein, which, constitute, the, most, notable, portion, of, landmines, left, over, from, world, war, ii, were, left, by, the, afrika, korps, or, the, british, army, led, by, field, marshal, montgomery, egypt, has, not, joined, the, mine, ban, treaty, until, this, day, rommel, sharply, protested, the, jewish, policies, and, other, immoralities, and, was, an, opponent, of, the, gestapo, he, also, refused, to, comply, with, hitler, s, order, to, execute, jewish, pows, controversial, author, bryan, mark, rigg, writes, the, only, place, in, the, army, where, one, might, find, a, place, of, refuge, was, in, the, deutsches, afrika, korps, dak, under, the, leadership, of, the, desert, fox, field, marshal, erwin, rommel, according, to, this, study, s, files, his, half, jews, were, not, as, affected, by, the, racial, laws, as, most, others, serving, on, the, european, continent, he, notes, though, that, perhaps, rommel, failed, to, enforce, the, order, to, discharge, half, jews, because, he, was, unaware, of, it, captain, horst, van, oppenfeld, a, staff, officer, to, colonel, claus, von, stauffenberg, and, a, quarter, jew, says, that, rommel, did, not, concern, himself, with, the, racial, decrees, and, he, had, never, experienced, any, trouble, caused, by, his, ancestry, during, his, time, in, the, dak, even, if, rommel, never, personally, interfered, on, his, behalf, another, quarter, jew, fritz, bayerlein, became, a, famous, general, and, rommel, s, chief, of, staff, despite, also, being, a, bisexual, which, made, his, situation, even, more, precarious, building, the, atlantic, wall, was, officially, the, responsibility, of, the, organisation, todt, which, was, not, under, rommel, s, command, but, he, enthusiastically, joined, the, task, protesting, slave, labour, and, suggesting, that, they, should, recruit, french, civilians, and, pay, them, good, wages, despite, this, french, civilians, and, italian, prisoners, of, war, held, by, the, germans, were, forced, by, officials, under, the, vichy, government, the, todt, organization, and, the, ss, forces, to, work, on, building, some, of, the, defences, rommel, requested, in, appalling, conditions, according, to, historian, will, fowler, although, they, got, basic, wages, the, workers, complained, because, it, was, too, little, and, there, was, no, heavy, equipment, german, troops, worked, almost, round, the, clock, under, very, harsh, conditions, with, rommel, s, rewards, being, accordions, rommel, was, one, of, the, commanders, who, protested, the, oradour, sur, glane, massacre, rommel, was, famous, in, his, lifetime, including, among, his, adversaries, his, tactical, prowess, and, decency, in, the, treatment, of, allied, prisoners, earned, him, the, respect, of, opponents, including, claude, auchinleck, archibald, wavell, george, s, patton, and, bernard, montgomery, rommel, s, military, reputation, has, been, controversial, while, nearly, all, military, practitioners, acknowledge, rommel, s, excellent, tactical, skills, and, personal, bravery, some, such, as, u, s, major, general, and, military, historian, david, t, zabecki, of, the, united, states, naval, institute, consider, rommel, s, performance, as, an, operational, level, commander, to, be, highly, overstated, and, that, other, officers, share, this, belief, general, klaus, naumann, who, served, as, chief, of, staff, of, the, bundeswehr, agrees, with, the, military, historian, charles, messenger, that, rommel, had, challenges, at, the, operational, level, and, states, that, rommel, s, violation, of, the, unity, of, command, principle, bypassing, the, chain, of, command, in, africa, was, unacceptable, and, contributed, to, the, eventual, operational, and, strategic, failure, in, north, africa, the, german, biographer, wolf, heckmann, describes, rommel, as, the, most, overrated, commander, of, an, army, in, world, history, nevertheless, there, is, also, a, notable, number, of, officers, who, admire, his, methods, like, norman, schwarzkopf, who, described, rommel, as, a, genius, at, battles, of, movement, saying, look, at, rommel, look, at, north, africa, the, arab, israeli, wars, and, all, the, rest, of, them, a, war, in, the, desert, is, a, war, of, mobility, and, lethality, it, s, not, a, war, where, straight, lines, are, drawn, in, the, sand, and, say, i, will, defend, here, or, die, ariel, sharon, deemed, the, german, military, model, used, by, rommel, to, be, superior, to, the, british, model, used, by, montgomery, his, compatriot, moshe, dayan, likewise, considered, rommel, a, model, and, icon, wesley, clark, states, that, rommel, s, military, reputation, though, has, lived, on, and, still, sets, the, standard, for, a, style, of, daring, charismatic, leadership, to, which, most, officers, aspire, during, the, recent, desert, wars, rommel, s, military, theories, and, experiences, attracted, great, interest, from, policymakers, and, military, instructors, chinese, military, leader, sun, li, jen, had, the, laudatory, nickname, rommel, of, the, east, certain, modern, military, historians, such, as, larry, t, addington, niall, barr, douglas, porch, and, robert, citino, are, sceptical, of, rommel, as, an, operational, let, alone, strategic, level, commander, they, point, to, rommel, s, lack, of, appreciation, for, germany, s, strategic, situation, his, misunderstanding, of, the, relative, importance, of, his, theatre, to, the, german, high, command, his, poor, grasp, of, logistical, realities, and, according, to, the, historian, ian, beckett, his, penchant, for, glory, hunting, citino, credits, rommel, s, limitations, as, an, operational, level, commander, as, materially, contributing, to, the, eventual, demise, of, the, axis, forces, in, north, africa, while, addington, focuses, on, the, struggle, over, strategy, whereby, rommel, s, initial, brilliant, success, resulted, in, catastrophic, effects, for, germany, in, north, africa, porch, highlights, rommel, s, offensive, mentality, symptomatic, of, the, wehrmacht, commanders, as, a, whole, in, the, belief, that, the, tactical, and, operational, victories, would, lead, to, strategic, success, compounding, the, problem, was, the, wehrmacht, s, institutional, tendency, to, discount, logistics, industrial, output, and, their, opponents, capacity, to, learn, from, past, mistakes, the, historian, geoffrey, p, megargee, points, out, rommel, s, playing, the, german, and, italian, command, structures, against, each, other, to, his, advantage, rommel, used, the, confused, structure, the, high, command, of, the, armed, forces, the, okh, supreme, high, command, of, the, army, and, the, comando, supremo, italian, supreme, command, to, disregard, orders, that, he, disagreed, with, or, to, appeal, to, whatever, authority, he, felt, would, be, most, sympathetic, to, his, requests, some, historians, take, issue, with, rommel, s, absence, from, normandy, on, the, day, of, the, allied, invasion, 6, june, 1944, he, had, left, france, on, 5, june, and, was, at, home, on, the, 6th, celebrating, his, wife, s, birthday, according, to, rommel, he, planned, to, proceed, to, see, hitler, the, next, day, to, discuss, the, situation, in, normandy, zabecki, calls, his, decision, to, leave, the, theatre, in, view, of, an, imminent, invasion, an, incredible, lapse, of, command, responsibility, lieb, remarks, that, rommel, displayed, real, mental, agility, but, the, lack, of, an, energetic, commander, together, with, other, problems, caused, the, battle, largely, not, to, be, conducted, in, his, concept, which, is, the, opposite, of, the, german, doctrine, although, the, result, was, still, better, than, geyr, s, plan, lieb, also, opines, that, while, his, harshest, critics, who, mostly, came, from, the, general, staff, often, said, that, rommel, was, overrated, or, not, suitable, for, higher, commands, envy, was, a, big, factor, here, t, l, mcmahon, argues, that, while, rommel, no, doubt, possessed, operational, vision, he, did, not, have, the, strategic, resources, to, effect, his, operational, choices, while, his, forces, provided, the, tactical, ability, to, accomplish, his, goals, and, the, german, staff, and, system, of, staff, command, were, designed, for, commanders, who, led, from, the, front, and, in, some, cases, he, might, have, chosen, the, same, options, as, montgomery, a, reputedly, strategy, oriented, commander, had, he, been, put, in, the, same, conditions, according, to, steven, zaloga, tactical, flexibility, was, a, great, advantage, of, the, german, system, but, in, the, final, years, of, the, war, hitler, and, his, cronies, like, himmler, and, goering, had, usurped, more, and, more, authority, at, the, strategic, level, leaving, professionals, like, rommel, increasing, constraints, on, their, actions, martin, blumenson, considers, rommel, a, general, with, a, compelling, view, of, strategy, and, logistics, which, was, demonstrated, through, his, many, arguments, with, his, superiors, over, such, matters, although, blumenson, also, thinks, that, what, distinguished, rommel, was, his, boldness, his, intuitive, feel, for, the, battlefield, upon, which, schwarzkopf, also, comments, rommel, had, a, feel, for, the, battlefield, like, no, other, man, joseph, forbes, comments, that, the, complex, conflict, filled, interaction, between, rommel, and, his, superiors, over, logistics, objectives, and, priorities, should, not, be, used, to, detract, from, rommel, s, reputation, as, a, remarkable, military, leader, because, rommel, was, not, given, powers, over, logistics, and, because, if, only, generals, who, attain, strategic, policy, goals, are, great, generals, such, highly, regarded, commanders, as, robert, e, lee, hannibal, charles, xii, would, have, to, be, excluded, from, that, list, general, siegfried, f, storbeck, deputy, inspector, general, of, the, bundeswehr, 1987, 1991, remarks, that, rommel, s, leadership, style, and, offensive, thinking, although, carrying, inherent, risks, like, losing, the, overview, of, the, situation, and, creating, overlapping, of, authority, have, been, proved, effective, and, have, been, analysed, and, incorporated, in, the, training, of, officers, by, us, our, western, allies, the, warsaw, pact, and, even, the, israel, defense, forces, maurice, remy, defends, his, strategic, decision, regarding, malta, as, although, risky, the, only, logical, choice, rommel, was, among, the, few, axis, commanders, the, others, being, isoroku, yamamoto, and, reinhard, heydrich, who, were, targeted, for, assassination, by, allied, planners, two, attempts, were, made, the, first, being, operation, flipper, in, north, africa, in, 1941, and, the, second, being, operation, gaff, in, normandy, in, 1944, research, by, norman, ohler, claims, that, rommel, s, behaviours, were, heavily, influenced, by, pervitin, which, he, reportedly, took, in, heavy, doses, to, such, an, extent, that, ohler, refers, to, him, as, the, crystal, fox, kristallfuchs, playing, off, the, nickname, desert, fox, famously, given, to, him, by, the, british, in, france, rommel, ordered, the, execution, of, one, french, officer, who, refused, three, times, to, cooperate, when, being, taken, prisoner, there, are, disputes, as, to, whether, this, execution, was, justified, caddick, adams, comments, that, this, would, make, rommel, a, war, criminal, condemned, by, his, own, hand, and, that, other, authors, overlook, this, episode, butler, notes, that, the, officer, refused, to, surrender, three, times, and, thus, died, in, a, courageous, but, foolhardy, way, french, historian, petitfr, re, remarks, that, rommel, was, in, a, hurry, and, had, no, time, for, useless, palavers, although, this, act, was, still, debatable, telp, remarks, that, he, treated, prisoners, of, war, with, consideration, on, one, occasion, he, was, forced, to, order, the, shooting, of, a, french, lieutenant, colonel, for, refusing, to, obey, his, captors, scheck, says, although, there, is, no, evidence, incriminating, rommel, himself, his, unit, did, fight, in, areas, where, german, massacres, of, black, french, prisoners, of, war, were, extremely, common, in, june, 1940, historian, david, stone, notes, that, acts, of, shooting, surrendered, prisoners, were, carried, out, by, rommel, s, 7th, panzer, division, and, observes, contradictory, statements, in, rommel, s, account, of, the, events, rommel, initially, wrote, that, any, enemy, troops, were, wiped, out, or, forced, to, withdraw, but, also, added, that, many, prisoners, taken, were, hopelessly, drunk, stone, attributes, the, massacres, of, soldiers, from, the, 53, me, regiment, d, infanterie, coloniale, n, tchor, r, s, unit, on, 7, june, to, the, 5th, infantry, division, historian, daniel, butler, agrees, that, it, was, possible, that, the, massacre, at, le, quesnoy, happened, given, the, existence, of, nazis, such, as, hanke, in, rommel, s, division, while, stating, that, in, comparison, with, other, german, units, few, sources, regarding, such, actions, of, the, men, of, the, 7th, panzer, exist, butler, believes, that, it, s, almost, impossible, to, imagine, rommel, authorising, or, countenancing, such, actions, he, also, writes, that, some, accusers, have, twisted, a, remark, in, rommel, s, own, account, of, the, action, in, the, village, of, le, quesnoy, as, proof, that, he, at, least, tacitly, condoned, the, executions, any, enemy, troops, were, either, wiped, out, or, forced, to, withdraw, but, the, words, themselves, as, well, as, the, context, of, the, passage, hardly, support, the, contention, giordana, terracina, writes, that, on, april, 3, the, italians, recaptured, benghazi, and, a, few, months, later, the, afrika, korps, led, by, rommel, was, sent, to, libya, and, began, the, deportation, of, the, jews, of, cyrenaica, in, the, giado, concentration, camp, and, other, smaller, towns, in, tripolitania, this, measure, was, accompanied, by, shooting, also, in, benghazi, of, some, jews, guilty, of, having, welcomed, the, british, troops, on, their, arrival, treating, them, as, liberators, gershom, states, that, italian, authorities, were, responsible, for, bringing, jews, into, their, concentration, camps, which, were, not, built, to, exterminate, its, inmates, yet, as, the, water, and, food, supply, was, meagre, were, not, built, to, keep, humans, alive, either, also, according, to, gershom, the, german, consul, in, tripoli, knew, about, the, process, and, trucks, used, to, transport, supplies, to, rommel, were, sometimes, used, to, transport, jews, despite, all, the, problems, the, german, forces, were, having, the, jerusalem, post, s, review, of, gershom, gorenberg, s, war, of, shadows, writes, that, the, italians, were, far, more, brutal, with, civilians, including, libyan, jews, than, rommel, s, afrika, korps, which, by, all, accounts, abided, by, the, laws, of, war, but, nobody, worried, that, the, italians, who, sent, jews, to, concentration, camps, in, libya, would, invade, british, held, egypt, let, alone, mandatory, palestine, according, to, german, historian, wolfgang, proske, rommel, forbade, his, soldiers, from, buying, anything, from, the, jewish, population, of, tripoli, used, jewish, slave, labour, and, commanded, jews, to, clear, out, minefields, by, walking, on, them, ahead, of, his, forces, according, to, proske, some, of, the, libyan, jews, were, eventually, sent, to, concentration, camps, historians, christian, schweizer, and, peter, lieb, note, that, over, the, last, few, years, even, though, the, social, science, teacher, wolfgang, proske, has, sought, to, participate, in, the, discussion, with, very, strong, opinions, his, biased, submissions, are, not, scientifically, received, the, heidenheimer, zeitung, notes, that, proske, was, the, publisher, of, his, main, work, t, ter, helfer, trittbrettfahrer, ns, belastete, von, der, ostalb, after, failing, to, have, it, published, by, another, publisher, according, to, historian, michael, wolffsohn, during, the, africa, campaign, preparations, for, committing, genocide, against, the, north, african, jews, were, in, full, swing, and, a, thousand, of, them, were, transported, to, east, european, concentration, camps, at, the, same, time, he, recommends, the, bundeswehr, to, keep, the, names, and, traditions, associated, with, rommel, although, wolffsohn, opines, that, focus, should, be, put, on, the, politically, thoughtful, soldier, he, became, at, the, end, of, his, life, rather, than, the, swashbuckler, and, the, humane, rogue, robert, satloff, writes, in, his, book, among, the, righteous, lost, stories, from, the, holocaust, s, long, reach, into, arab, lands, that, as, the, german, and, italian, forces, retreated, across, libya, towards, tunisia, the, jewish, population, became, victim, upon, which, they, released, their, anger, and, frustration, according, to, satloff, afrika, korps, soldiers, plundered, jewish, property, all, along, the, libyan, coast, this, violence, and, persecution, only, came, to, an, end, with, the, arrival, of, general, montgomery, in, tripoli, on, 23, january, 1943, according, to, maurice, remy, although, there, were, antisemitic, individuals, in, the, afrika, korps, actual, cases, of, abuse, are, not, known, even, against, the, jewish, soldiers, of, the, eighth, army, remy, quotes, isaac, levy, the, senior, jewish, chaplain, of, the, eighth, army, as, saying, that, he, had, never, seen, any, sign, or, hint, that, the, soldiers, are, antisemitic, the, telegraph, comments, accounts, suggest, that, it, was, not, field, marshal, erwin, rommel, but, the, ruthless, ss, colonel, walter, rauff, who, stripped, tunisian, jews, of, their, wealth, commenting, on, rommel, s, conquest, of, tunisia, marvin, perry, writes, that, the, bridgehead, rommel, established, in, tunisia, enabled, the, ss, to, herd, jews, into, slave, labor, camps, jan, friedmann, writes, that, the, ss, had, established, a, network, of, labor, camps, in, tunisia, more, than, 2, 500, tunisian, jews, died, in, six, months, of, german, rule, and, the, regular, army, was, also, involved, in, executions, caron, writes, in, der, spiegel, that, the, camps, were, organised, in, early, december, 1942, by, nehring, the, commander, in, tunisia, and, rauff, while, rommel, was, retreating, as, commander, of, the, german, afrika, korps, nehring, would, continue, to, use, tunisian, forced, labour, according, to, caddick, adams, no, waffen, ss, served, under, rommel, in, africa, at, any, time, and, most, of, the, activities, of, rauff, s, detachment, happened, after, rommel, s, departure, shepherd, notes, that, during, this, time, rommel, was, retreating, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, had, contact, with, the, einsatzkommando, addressing, the, call, of, some, authors, to, contextualise, rommel, s, actions, in, italy, and, north, africa, wolfgang, m, hrle, argues, that, while, it, is, undeniable, that, rommel, played, the, role, of, a, generalfeldmarschall, in, a, criminal, war, this, only, illustrates, in, a, limited, way, his, personal, attitude, and, the, actions, resulted, from, that, according, to, several, historians, allegations, and, stories, that, associate, rommel, and, the, afrika, korps, with, the, harassing, and, plundering, of, jewish, gold, and, property, in, tunisia, are, usually, known, under, the, name, rommel, s, treasure, or, rommel, s, gold, michael, fitzgerald, comments, that, the, treasure, should, be, named, more, accurately, as, rauff, s, gold, as, rommel, had, nothing, to, do, with, its, acquisition, or, removal, jean, christoph, caron, comments, that, the, treasure, legend, has, a, real, core, and, that, jewish, property, was, looted, by, the, ss, in, tunisia, and, later, might, have, been, hidden, or, sunken, around, the, port, city, of, corsica, where, rauff, was, stationed, in, 1943, the, person, who, gave, birth, to, the, full, blown, legend, was, the, ss, soldier, walter, kirner, who, presented, a, false, map, to, the, french, authorities, caron, and, j, rg, m, llner, his, co, author, of, the, zdf, documentary, rommel, s, treasure, rommels, schatz, tell, die, welt, that, rommel, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, treasure, but, his, name, is, assoc, ated, with, everything, that, happened, in, the, war, in, africa, rick, atkinson, criticises, rommel, for, gaining, a, looted, stamp, collection, a, bribe, from, sepp, dietrich, and, a, villa, taken, from, jews, lucas, matthews, and, remy, though, describe, the, contemptuous, and, angry, reaction, of, rommel, towards, dietrich, s, act, and, the, lootings, and, other, brutal, behaviours, of, the, ss, that, he, had, discovered, in, italy, claudia, hecht, also, explains, that, although, the, stuttgart, and, ulm, authorities, did, arrange, for, the, rommel, family, to, use, a, villa, whose, jewish, owners, had, been, forced, out, two, years, earlier, for, a, brief, period, after, their, own, house, had, been, destroyed, by, allied, bombing, ownership, of, it, was, never, transferred, to, them, butler, notes, that, rommel, was, one, of, the, few, who, refused, large, estates, and, gifts, of, cash, hitler, gave, to, his, generals, at, the, beginning, although, hitler, and, goebbels, took, particular, notice, of, rommel, the, nazi, elites, had, no, intent, to, create, one, major, war, symbol, partly, out, of, fear, that, he, would, offset, hitler, generating, huge, propaganda, campaigns, for, not, only, rommel, but, also, gerd, von, rundstedt, walther, von, brauchitsch, eduard, dietl, sepp, dietrich, the, latter, two, were, party, members, and, also, strongly, supported, by, hitler, etc, nevertheless, a, multitude, of, factors, including, rommel, s, unusual, charisma, his, talents, both, in, military, matters, and, public, relations, the, efforts, of, goebbels, s, propaganda, machine, and, the, allies, participation, in, mythologising, his, life, either, for, political, benefits, sympathy, for, someone, who, evoked, a, romantic, archetype, or, genuine, admiration, for, his, actions, gradually, contributed, to, rommel, s, fame, spiegel, wrote, even, back, then, his, fame, outshone, that, of, all, other, commanders, rommel, s, victories, in, france, were, featured, in, the, german, press, and, in, the, february, 1941, film, sieg, im, westen, victory, in, the, west, in, which, rommel, personally, helped, direct, a, segment, re, enacting, the, crossing, of, the, somme, river, according, to, scheck, although, there, is, no, evidence, of, rommel, committing, crimes, during, the, shooting, of, the, movie, african, prisoners, of, war, were, forced, to, take, part, in, its, making, and, forced, to, carry, out, humiliating, acts, stills, from, the, re, enactment, are, found, in, rommel, collection, it, was, filmed, by, hans, ertl, assigned, to, this, task, by, dr, kurt, hesse, a, personal, friend, of, rommel, who, worked, for, wehrmacht, propaganda, section, v, rommel, s, victories, in, 1941, were, played, up, by, the, nazi, propaganda, even, though, his, successes, in, north, africa, were, achieved, in, arguably, one, of, germany, s, least, strategically, important, theatres, of, world, war, ii, in, november, 1941, reich, minister, of, propaganda, joseph, goebbels, wrote, about, the, urgent, need, to, have, rommel, elevated, to, a, kind, of, popular, hero, rommel, with, his, innate, abilities, as, a, military, commander, and, love, of, the, spotlight, was, a, perfect, fit, for, the, role, goebbels, designed, for, him, in, north, africa, rommel, received, help, in, cultivating, his, image, from, alfred, ingemar, berndt, a, senior, official, at, the, reich, propaganda, ministry, who, had, volunteered, for, military, service, seconded, by, goebbels, berndt, was, assigned, to, rommel, s, staff, and, became, one, of, his, closest, aides, berndt, often, acted, as, a, liaison, between, rommel, the, propaganda, ministry, and, the, f, hrer, headquarters, he, directed, rommel, s, photo, shoots, and, filed, radio, dispatches, describing, the, battles, in, the, spring, of, 1941, rommel, s, name, began, to, appear, in, the, british, media, in, the, autumn, of, 1941, and, early, winter, of, 1941, 1942, he, was, mentioned, in, the, british, press, almost, daily, toward, the, end, of, the, year, the, reich, propaganda, machine, also, used, rommel, s, successes, in, africa, as, a, diversion, from, the, wehrmacht, s, challenging, situation, in, the, soviet, union, with, the, stall, of, operation, barbarossa, the, american, press, soon, began, to, take, notice, of, rommel, as, well, following, the, country, s, entry, into, the, war, on, 11, december, 1941, writing, that, the, british, admire, him, because, he, beat, them, and, were, surprised, to, have, beaten, in, turn, such, a, capable, general, general, auchinleck, distributed, a, directive, to, his, commanders, seeking, to, dispel, the, notion, that, rommel, was, a, superman, rommel, no, matter, how, hard, the, situation, was, made, a, deliberate, effort, at, always, spending, some, time, with, soldiers, and, patients, his, own, and, pows, alike, which, contributed, greatly, to, his, reputation, of, not, only, being, a, great, commander, but, also, a, decent, chap, among, the, troops, the, attention, of, the, western, and, especially, the, british, press, thrilled, goebbels, who, wrote, in, his, diary, in, early, 1942, rommel, continues, to, be, the, recognized, darling, of, even, the, enemies, news, agencies, the, field, marshal, was, pleased, by, the, media, attention, although, he, knew, the, downsides, of, having, a, reputation, hitler, took, note, of, the, british, propaganda, as, well, commenting, in, the, summer, of, 1942, that, britain, s, leaders, must, have, hoped, to, be, able, to, explain, their, defeat, to, their, own, nation, more, easily, by, focusing, on, rommel, the, field, marshal, was, the, german, commander, most, frequently, covered, in, the, german, media, and, the, only, one, to, be, given, a, press, conference, which, took, place, in, october, 1942, the, press, conference, was, moderated, by, goebbels, and, was, attended, by, both, domestic, and, foreign, media, rommel, declared, today, we, have, the, gates, of, egypt, in, hand, and, with, the, intent, to, act, keeping, the, focus, on, rommel, distracted, the, german, public, from, wehrmacht, losses, elsewhere, as, the, tide, of, the, war, began, to, turn, he, became, a, symbol, that, was, used, to, reinforce, the, german, public, s, faith, in, an, ultimate, axis, victory, in, the, wake, of, the, successful, british, offensive, in, november, 1942, and, other, military, reverses, the, propaganda, ministry, directed, the, media, to, emphasise, rommel, s, invincibility, the, charade, was, maintained, until, the, spring, of, 1943, even, as, the, german, situation, in, africa, became, increasingly, precarious, to, ensure, that, the, inevitable, defeat, in, africa, would, not, be, associated, with, rommel, s, name, goebbels, had, the, army, high, command, announce, in, may, 1943, that, rommel, was, on, a, two, month, leave, for, health, reasons, instead, the, campaign, was, presented, by, berndt, who, resumed, his, role, in, the, propaganda, ministry, as, a, ruse, to, tie, down, the, british, empire, while, germany, was, turning, europe, into, an, impenetrable, fortress, with, rommel, at, the, helm, of, this, success, after, the, radio, programme, ran, in, may, 1943, rommel, sent, berndt, a, case, of, cigars, as, a, sign, of, his, gratitude, although, rommel, then, entered, a, period, without, a, significant, command, he, remained, a, household, name, in, germany, synonymous, with, the, aura, of, invincibility, hitler, then, made, rommel, part, of, his, defensive, strategy, for, fortress, europe, festung, europa, by, sending, him, to, the, west, to, inspect, fortifications, along, the, atlantic, wall, goebbels, supported, the, decision, noting, in, his, diary, that, rommel, was, undoubtedly, the, suitable, man, for, the, task, the, propaganda, minister, expected, the, move, to, reassure, the, german, public, and, at, the, same, time, to, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, allied, forces, morale, in, france, a, wehrmacht, propaganda, company, frequently, accompanied, rommel, on, his, inspection, trips, to, document, his, work, for, both, domestic, and, foreign, audiences, in, may, 1944, the, german, newsreels, reported, on, rommel, s, speech, at, a, wehrmacht, conference, where, he, stated, his, conviction, that, every, single, german, soldier, will, make, his, contribution, against, the, anglo, american, spirit, that, it, deserves, for, its, criminal, and, bestial, air, war, campaign, against, our, homeland, the, speech, led, to, an, upswing, in, morale, and, sustained, confidence, in, rommel, when, rommel, was, seriously, wounded, on, 17, july, 1944, the, propaganda, ministry, undertook, efforts, to, conceal, the, injury, so, as, not, to, undermine, domestic, morale, despite, those, the, news, leaked, to, the, british, press, to, counteract, the, rumours, of, a, serious, injury, and, even, death, rommel, was, required, to, appear, at, a, 1, august, press, conference, on, 3, august, the, german, press, published, an, official, report, that, rommel, had, been, injured, in, a, car, accident, rommel, noted, in, his, diary, his, dismay, at, this, twisting, of, the, truth, belatedly, realising, how, much, the, reich, propaganda, was, using, him, for, its, own, ends, rommel, was, interested, in, propaganda, beyond, the, promotion, of, his, own, image, in, 1944, after, visiting, rommel, in, france, and, reading, his, proposals, on, counteracting, allied, propaganda, alfred, ingemar, berndt, remarked, he, is, also, interested, in, this, propaganda, business, and, wants, to, develop, it, by, all, means, he, has, even, thought, and, brought, out, practical, suggestions, for, each, program, and, subject, rommel, saw, the, propaganda, and, education, values, in, his, and, his, nation, s, deeds, he, also, did, value, justice, itself, according, to, admiral, ruge, s, diary, rommel, told, ruge, justice, is, the, indispensable, foundation, of, a, nation, unfortunately, the, higher, ups, are, not, clean, the, slaughterings, are, grave, sins, the, key, to, the, successful, creating, of, an, image, according, to, rommel, was, leading, by, example, the, men, tend, to, feel, no, kind, of, contact, with, a, commander, who, they, know, is, sitting, somewhere, in, headquarters, what, they, want, is, what, might, be, termed, a, physical, contact, with, him, in, moments, of, panic, fatigue, or, disorganization, or, when, something, out, of, the, ordinary, has, to, be, demanded, from, them, the, personal, example, of, the, commander, works, wonders, especially, if, he, has, had, the, wit, to, create, some, sort, of, legend, around, himself, he, urged, axis, authorities, to, treat, the, arab, with, the, utmost, respect, to, prevent, uprisings, behind, the, front, he, protested, the, use, of, propaganda, at, the, cost, of, explicit, military, benefits, though, criticising, hitler, s, headquarters, for, being, unable, to, tell, the, german, people, and, the, world, that, el, alamein, had, been, lost, and, preventing, the, evacuation, of, the, german, forces, in, northern, africa, in, the, process, ruge, suggests, that, his, chief, treated, his, own, fame, as, a, kind, of, weapon, in, 1943, he, surprised, hitler, by, proposing, that, a, jew, should, be, made, into, a, gauleiter, to, prove, to, the, world, that, germany, was, innocent, of, accusations, that, rommel, had, heard, from, the, enemy, s, propaganda, regarding, the, mistreatment, of, jews, hitler, replied, dear, rommel, you, understand, nothing, about, my, thinking, at, all, rommel, was, not, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, rommel, and, hitler, had, a, close, and, genuine, if, complicated, personal, relationship, rommel, as, other, wehrmacht, officers, welcomed, the, nazi, rise, to, power, numerous, historians, state, that, rommel, was, one, of, hitler, s, favourite, generals, and, that, his, close, relationship, with, the, dictator, benefited, both, his, inter, war, and, war, time, career, robert, citino, describes, rommel, as, not, apolitical, and, writes, that, he, owed, his, career, to, hitler, to, whom, rommel, s, attitude, was, worshipful, with, messenger, agreeing, that, rommel, owed, his, tank, command, his, hero, status, and, other, promotions, to, hitler, s, interference, and, support, kesselring, described, rommel, s, own, power, over, hitler, as, hypnotic, in, 1944, rommel, himself, told, ruge, and, his, wife, that, hitler, had, a, kind, of, irresistible, magnetic, aura, magnetismus, and, was, always, seemingly, in, an, intoxicated, condition, maurice, remy, identifies, that, the, point, at, which, their, relationship, became, a, personal, one, was, 1939, when, rommel, proudly, announced, to, his, friend, kurt, hesse, that, he, had, sort, of, forced, hitler, to, go, with, me, to, the, hradschin, castle, in, prague, in, an, open, top, car, without, another, bodyguard, under, my, personal, protection, he, had, entrusted, himself, to, me, and, would, never, forget, me, for, my, excellent, advice, the, close, relationship, between, rommel, and, hitler, continued, following, the, western, campaign, after, rommel, sent, him, a, specially, prepared, diary, on, the, 7th, division, he, received, a, letter, of, thanks, from, the, dictator, according, to, speer, he, would, normally, send, extremely, unclear, reports, which, annoyed, hitler, greatly, according, to, maurice, remy, the, relationship, which, remy, calls, a, dream, marriage, showed, the, first, crack, only, in, 1942, and, later, gradually, turned, into, in, the, words, of, german, writer, ernst, j, nger, in, contact, with, rommel, in, normandy, ha, liebe, a, love, hate, relationship, ruge, s, diary, and, rommel, s, letters, to, his, wife, show, his, mood, fluctuating, wildly, regarding, hitler, while, he, showed, disgust, towards, the, atrocities, and, disappointment, towards, the, situation, he, was, overjoyed, to, welcome, a, visit, from, hitler, only, to, return, to, depression, the, next, day, when, faced, with, reality, hitler, displayed, the, same, emotions, amid, growing, doubts, and, differences, he, would, remain, eager, for, rommel, s, calls, they, had, almost, daily, hour, long, highly, animated, conversations, with, the, preferred, topic, being, technical, innovations, he, once, almost, grabbed, the, telephone, out, of, linge, s, hand, but, according, to, linge, seeing, rommel, s, disobedience, hitler, also, realised, his, mistake, in, building, up, rommel, whom, not, only, the, afrika, korps, but, also, the, german, people, in, general, now, considered, the, german, god, hitler, tried, to, fix, the, dysfunctional, relationship, many, times, without, results, with, rommel, calling, his, attempts, sunlamp, treatment, although, later, he, said, that, once, i, have, loved, the, f, hrer, and, i, still, do, remy, and, der, spiegel, remark, that, the, statement, was, very, much, genuine, while, watson, notes, that, rommel, believed, he, deserved, to, die, for, his, treasonable, plan, rommel, was, an, ambitious, man, who, took, advantage, of, his, proximity, to, hitler, and, willingly, accepted, the, propaganda, campaigns, designed, for, him, by, goebbels, on, one, hand, he, wanted, personal, promotion, and, the, realisation, of, his, ideals, on, the, other, hand, being, elevated, by, the, traditional, system, that, gave, preferential, treatment, to, aristocratic, officers, would, be, betrayal, of, his, aspiration, to, remain, a, man, of, the, troops, in, 1918, rommel, refused, an, invitation, to, a, prestigious, officer, training, course, and, with, it, the, chance, to, be, promoted, to, general, additionally, he, had, no, inclination, towards, the, political, route, preferring, to, remain, a, soldier, nur, soldat, he, was, thus, attracted, by, the, common, man, theme, which, promised, to, level, german, society, the, glorification, of, the, national, community, and, the, idea, of, a, soldier, of, common, background, who, served, the, fatherland, with, talent, and, got, rewarded, by, another, common, man, who, embodied, the, will, of, the, german, people, while, he, had, much, indignation, towards, germany, s, contemporary, class, problem, this, self, association, with, the, common, man, went, along, well, with, his, desire, to, simulate, the, knights, of, the, past, who, also, led, from, the, front, rommel, seemed, to, enjoy, the, idea, of, peace, as, shown, by, his, words, to, his, wife, in, august, 1939, you, can, trust, me, we, have, taken, part, in, one, world, war, but, as, long, as, our, generation, live, there, will, not, be, a, second, as, well, as, his, letter, sent, to, her, the, night, before, the, invasion, of, poland, in, which, he, expressed, in, maurice, remy, s, phrase, boundless, optimism, i, still, believe, the, atmosphere, will, not, become, more, bellicose, butler, remarks, that, rommel, was, centre, in, his, politics, leaning, a, little, to, the, left, in, his, attitude, messenger, argues, that, rommel, s, attitude, towards, hitler, changed, only, after, the, allied, invasion, of, normandy, when, rommel, came, to, realise, that, the, war, could, not, be, won, while, maurice, remy, suggests, that, rommel, never, truly, broke, away, from, the, relationship, with, hitler, but, praises, him, for, always, the, courage, to, oppose, him, whenever, his, conscience, required, so, the, historian, peter, lieb, states, that, it, was, not, clear, whether, the, threat, of, defeat, was, the, only, reason, rommel, wanted, to, switch, sides, the, relationship, seemed, to, go, significantly, downhill, after, a, conversation, in, july, 1943, in, which, hitler, told, rommel, that, if, they, did, not, win, the, war, the, germans, could, rot, rommel, even, began, to, think, that, it, was, lucky, that, his, afrika, korps, were, now, safe, as, pows, and, could, escape, hitler, s, wagnerian, ending, die, welt, commented, in, 2011, that, hitler, chose, rommel, as, his, favourite, because, he, was, apolitical, and, that, the, combination, of, his, military, expertise, and, circumstances, allowed, rommel, to, remain, clean, rommel, s, political, inclinations, were, a, controversial, matter, even, among, the, contemporary, nazi, elites, rommel, himself, while, showing, support, to, some, facets, of, the, nazi, ideology, and, enjoying, the, propaganda, machine, that, the, nazis, had, built, around, him, was, enraged, by, the, nazi, media, s, effort, to, portray, him, as, an, early, party, member, and, son, of, a, mason, forcing, them, to, correct, this, misinformation, the, nazi, elites, were, not, comfortable, with, the, idea, of, a, national, icon, who, did, not, wholeheartedly, support, the, regime, hitler, and, goebbels, his, main, supporters, tended, to, defend, him, when, rommel, was, being, considered, for, appointment, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, in, the, summer, of, 1942, goebbels, wrote, in, his, diary, that, rommel, is, ideologically, sound, is, not, just, sympathetic, to, the, national, socialists, he, is, a, national, socialist, he, is, a, troop, leader, with, a, gift, for, improvisation, personally, courageous, and, extraordinarily, inventive, these, are, the, kinds, of, soldiers, we, need, despite, this, they, gradually, saw, that, his, grasp, of, political, realities, and, his, views, could, be, very, different, from, theirs, hitler, knew, though, that, rommel, s, optimistic, and, combative, character, was, indispensable, for, his, war, efforts, when, rommel, lost, faith, in, the, final, victory, and, hitler, s, leadership, hitler, and, goebbels, tried, to, find, an, alternative, in, manstein, to, remedy, the, fighting, will, and, political, direction, of, other, generals, but, did, not, succeed, meanwhile, officials, who, did, not, like, rommel, such, as, bormann, and, schirach, whispered, to, each, other, that, he, was, not, a, nazi, at, all, rommel, s, relationship, to, the, nazi, elites, other, than, hitler, and, goebbels, was, mostly, hostile, although, even, powerful, people, like, bormann, and, himmler, had, to, tread, carefully, around, rommel, himmler, who, played, a, decisive, role, in, rommel, s, death, tried, to, blame, keitel, and, jodl, for, the, deed, and, in, fact, the, deed, was, initiated, by, them, they, deeply, resented, rommel, s, meteoric, rise, and, had, long, feared, that, he, would, become, the, commander, in, chief, hitler, also, played, innocent, by, trying, to, erect, a, monument, for, the, national, hero, on, 7, march, 1945, franz, halder, after, concocting, several, schemes, to, rein, in, rommel, through, people, like, paulus, and, gause, to, no, avail, even, willing, to, undermine, german, operations, and, strategy, in, the, process, for, the, sole, purpose, of, embarrassing, him, concluded, that, rommel, was, a, madman, with, whom, no, one, dared, to, cross, swords, because, of, his, brutal, methods, and, his, backing, from, the, highest, levels, rommel, imposed, a, high, number, of, courts, martial, but, according, to, westphal, he, never, signed, the, final, order, owen, connelly, comments, that, he, could, afford, easy, discipline, because, of, his, charisma, rommel, for, his, part, was, highly, critical, of, himmler, halder, the, high, command, and, particularly, goering, who, rommel, at, one, point, called, his, bitterest, enemy, hitler, realised, that, rommel, attracted, the, elites, negative, emotions, to, himself, in, the, same, way, he, generated, optimism, in, the, common, people, depending, on, the, case, hitler, manipulated, or, exacerbated, the, situation, in, order, to, benefit, himself, although, he, originally, had, no, intent, of, pushing, rommel, to, the, point, of, destruction, even, when, informed, of, rommel, s, involvement, in, the, plot, hurt, and, vengeful, hitler, at, first, wanted, to, retire, rommel, and, eventually, offered, him, a, last, minute, chance, to, explain, himself, and, refute, the, claims, which, rommel, apparently, did, not, take, advantage, of, ultimately, rommel, s, enemies, worked, together, to, bring, him, down, maurice, remy, concludes, that, unwillingly, and, probably, without, ever, realising, it, rommel, was, part, of, a, murderous, regime, although, he, never, actually, grasped, the, core, of, nazism, peter, lieb, sees, rommel, as, a, person, who, could, not, be, put, into, a, single, drawer, although, problematic, by, modern, moral, standards, and, suggests, people, should, personally, decide, for, themselves, whether, rommel, should, remain, a, role, model, or, not, he, was, a, nazi, general, in, some, aspects, considering, his, support, for, the, leader, cult, f, hrerkult, and, the, volksgemeinschaft, but, he, was, not, an, antisemite, nor, a, war, criminal, nor, a, radical, ideological, fighter, historian, cornelia, hecht, remarks, it, is, really, hard, to, know, who, the, man, behind, the, myth, was, noting, that, in, numerous, letters, he, wrote, to, his, wife, during, their, almost, 30, year, marriage, he, commented, little, on, political, issues, as, well, as, his, personal, life, as, a, husband, and, a, father, according, to, some, revisionist, authors, an, assessment, of, rommel, s, role, in, history, has, been, hampered, by, views, of, rommel, that, were, formed, at, least, in, part, for, political, reasons, creating, what, these, historians, have, called, the, rommel, myth, the, interpretation, considered, by, some, historians, to, be, a, myth, is, the, depiction, of, the, field, marshal, as, an, apolitical, brilliant, commander, and, a, victim, of, nazi, germany, who, participated, in, the, 20, july, plot, against, adolf, hitler, there, are, a, notable, number, of, authors, who, refer, to, rommel, myth, or, rommel, legend, in, a, neutral, or, positive, manner, though, the, seeds, of, the, myth, can, be, found, first, in, rommel, s, drive, for, success, as, a, young, officer, in, world, war, i, and, then, in, his, popular, 1937, book, infantry, attacks, which, was, written, in, a, style, that, diverged, from, the, german, military, literature, of, the, time, and, became, a, best, seller, the, myth, then, took, shape, during, the, opening, years, of, world, war, ii, as, a, component, of, nazi, propaganda, to, praise, the, wehrmacht, and, instil, optimism, in, the, german, public, with, rommel, s, willing, participation, when, rommel, came, to, north, africa, it, was, picked, up, and, disseminated, in, the, west, by, the, british, press, as, the, allies, sought, to, explain, their, continued, inability, to, defeat, the, axis, forces, in, north, africa, the, british, military, and, political, figures, contributed, to, the, heroic, image, of, the, man, as, rommel, resumed, offensive,

who, were, needed, to, replace, the, former, ones, who, had, been, unmasked, as, criminals, rommel, was, chosen, because, he, embodied, the, decent, soldier, cunning, yet, fair, minded, and, if, guilty, by, association, not, so, guilty, that, he, became, unreliable, and, additionally, former, comrades, reported, that, he, was, close, to, the, resistance, while, everyone, else, was, disgraced, his, star, became, brighter, than, ever, and, he, made, the, historically, unprecedented, leap, over, the, threshold, between, eras, from, hitler, s, favourite, general, to, the, young, republic, s, hero, cornelia, hecht, notes, that, despite, the, change, of, times, rommel, has, become, the, symbol, of, different, regimes, and, concepts, which, is, paradoxical, whoever, the, man, he, really, was, at, the, same, time, the, western, allies, and, particularly, the, british, depicted, rommel, as, the, good, german, his, reputation, for, conducting, a, clean, war, was, used, in, the, interest, of, the, west, german, rearmament, and, reconciliation, between, the, former, enemies, britain, and, the, united, states, on, one, side, and, the, new, federal, republic, of, germany, on, the, other,

cited, in, western, sources, as, a, patriotic, german, willing, to, stand, up, to, hitler, churchill, wrote, about, him, in, 1950, deserves, our, respect, because, although, a, loyal, german, soldier, he, came, to, hate, hitler, and, all, his, works, and, took, part, in, the, conspiracy, of, 1944, to, rescue, germany, by, displacing, the, maniac, and, tyrant, while, at, cadet, school, in, 1911,
