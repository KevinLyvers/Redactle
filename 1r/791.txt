of, apollo, in, delphi, he, is, known, primarily, for, his, parallel, lives, a, series, of, biographies, of, illustrious, greeks, and, romans, and, moralia, a, collection, of, essays, and, speeches, upon, becoming, a, roman, citizen, he, was, possibly, named, lucius, mestrius, plutarchus, plutarch, was, born, to, a, prominent, family, in, the, small, town, of, chaeronea, about, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, east, of, delphi, in, the, greek, region, of, boeotia, his, family, was, long, established, in, the, town, his, father, was, named, autobulus, and, his, grandfather, was, named, lamprias, his, name, is, a, compound, of, the, greek, words, wealth, and, ruler, leader, in, the, traditional, aspirational, greek, naming, convention, the, whole, name, means, something, like, prosperous, leader, his, brothers, timon, and, lamprias, are, frequently, mentioned, in, his, essays, and, dialogues, which, speak, of, timon, in, particular, in, the, most, affectionate, terms, rualdus, in, his, 1624, work, life, of, plutarchus, recovered, the, name, of, plutarch, s, wife, timoxena, from, internal, evidence, afforded, by, his, writings, a, letter, is, still, extant, addressed, by, plutarch, to, his, wife, bidding, her, not, to, grieve, too, much, at, the, death, of, their, two, year, old, daughter, who, was, named, timoxena, after, her, mother, he, hinted, at, a, belief, in, reincarnation, in, that, letter, of, consolation, plutarch, studied, mathematics, and, philosophy, in, athens, under, ammonius, from, ad, 66, to, 67, he, attended, the, games, of, delphi, where, the, emperor, nero, competed, and, possibly, met, prominent, romans, including, future, emperor, vespasian, plutarch, and, timoxena, had, at, least, four, sons, and, one, daughter, although, two, died, in, childhood, the, loss, of, his, daughter, and, a, young, son, chaeron, are, mentioned, in, his, letter, to, timoxena, two, sons, named, autoboulos, and, plutarch, appear, in, a, number, of, plutarch, s, works, plutarch, s, treatise, on, plato, s, timaeus, is, dedicated, to, them, it, is, likely, that, a, third, son, named, soklaros, after, plutarch, s, confidant, soklaros, of, tithora, survived, to, adulthood, as, well, although, he, is, not, mentioned, in, plutarch, s, later, works, a, lucius, mestrius, soclarus, who, shares, plutarch, s, latin, family, name, appears, in, an, inscription, in, boeotia, from, the, time, of, trajan, traditionally, the, surviving, catalog, of, plutarch, s, works, is, ascribed, to, another, son, named, lamprias, after, plutarch, s, grandfather, most, modern, scholars, believe, this, tradition, is, a, later, interpolation, plutarch, s, treatise, on, marriage, questions, addressed, to, eurydice, and, pollianus, seems, to, speak, of, the, former, as, having, recently, lived, in, his, house, but, without, any, clear, evidence, on, whether, she, was, his, daughter, or, not, plutarch, was, either, the, uncle, or, grandfather, of, sextus, of, chaeronea, who, was, one, of, the, teachers, of, marcus, aurelius, and, who, may, have, been, the, same, person, as, the, philosopher, sextus, empiricus, his, family, remained, in, greece, down, to, at, least, the, fourth, century, producing, a, number, of, philosophers, and, authors, apuleius, the, author, of, the, golden, ass, made, his, fictional, protagonist, a, descendant, of, plutarch, plutarch, was, a, vegetarian, although, how, long, and, how, strictly, he, adhered, to, this, diet, is, unclear, he, wrote, about, the, ethics, of, meat, eating, in, two, discourses, in, moralia, at, some, point, plutarch, received, roman, citizenship, his, sponsor, was, lucius, mestrius, florus, who, was, an, associate, of, the, new, emperor, vespasian, as, evidenced, by, his, new, name, lucius, mestrius, plutarchus, as, a, roman, citizen, plutarch, would, have, been, of, the, equestrian, order, he, visited, rome, some, time, c, ad, 70, with, florus, who, served, also, as, a, historical, source, for, his, life, of, otho, plutarch, was, on, familiar, terms, with, a, number, of, roman, nobles, particularly, the, consulars, quintus, sosius, senecio, titus, avidius, quietus, and, arulenus, rusticus, all, of, whom, appear, in, his, works, he, lived, most, of, his, life, at, chaeronea, and, was, initiated, into, the, mysteries, of, the, greek, god, apollo, he, probably, took, part, in, the, eleusinian, mysteries, during, his, visit, to, rome, he, may, have, been, part, of, a, municipal, embassy, for, delphi, around, the, same, time, vespasian, granted, delphi, various, municipal, rights, and, privileges, in, addition, to, his, duties, as, a, priest, of, the, delphic, temple, plutarch, was, also, a, magistrate, at, chaeronea, and, he, represented, his, home, town, on, various, missions, to, foreign, countries, during, his, early, adult, years, plutarch, held, the, office, of, archon, in, his, native, municipality, probably, only, an, annual, one, which, he, likely, served, more, than, once, plutarch, was, epimeletes, manager, of, the, amphictyonic, league, for, at, least, five, terms, from, 107, to, 127, in, which, role, he, was, responsible, for, organising, the, pythian, games, he, mentions, this, service, in, his, work, whether, an, old, man, should, engage, in, public, affairs, 17, moralia, 792f, the, suda, a, medieval, greek, encyclopedia, states, that, trajan, made, plutarch, procurator, of, illyria, most, historians, consider, this, unlikely, since, illyria, was, not, a, procuratorial, province, according, to, the, 8th, 9th, century, historian, george, syncellus, late, in, plutarch, s, life, emperor, hadrian, appointed, him, nominal, procurator, of, achaea, which, entitled, him, to, wear, the, vestments, and, ornaments, of, a, consul, some, time, c, ad, 95, plutarch, was, made, one, of, the, two, sanctuary, priests, for, the, temple, of, apollo, at, delphi, the, site, had, declined, considerably, since, the, classical, greek, period, around, the, same, time, in, the, 90s, delphi, experienced, a, construction, boom, financed, by, greek, patrons, and, possible, imperial, support, his, priestly, duties, connected, part, of, his, literary, work, with, the, pythian, oracle, at, delphia, one, of, his, most, important, works, is, the, why, pythia, does, not, give, oracles, in, verse, even, more, important, is, the, dialogue, on, the, e, at, delphi, which, features, ammonius, a, platonic, philosopher, and, teacher, of, plutarch, and, lambrias, plutarch, s, brother, according, to, ammonius, the, letter, e, written, on, the, temple, of, apollo, in, delphi, originated, from, the, seven, sages, of, greece, whose, maxims, were, also, written, on, the, walls, of, the, vestibule, of, the, temple, and, were, not, seven, but, actually, five, chilon, solon, thales, bias, and, pittakos, the, tyrants, cleobulos, and, periandros, used, their, political, power, to, be, incorporated, in, the, list, thus, the, e, which, was, used, to, represent, the, number, 5, constituted, an, acknowledgement, that, the, delphic, maxims, actually, originated, from, only, five, genuine, wise, men, there, was, a, portrait, bust, dedicated, to, plutarch, for, his, efforts, in, helping, to, revive, the, delphic, shrines, the, portrait, of, a, philosopher, exhibited, at, the, exit, of, the, archaeological, museum, of, delphi, dates, to, the, 2nd, century, due, to, its, inscription, in, the, past, it, had, been, identified, with, plutarch, the, man, although, bearded, is, depicted, at, a, relatively, young, age, his, hair, and, beard, are, rendered, in, coarse, volumes, and, thin, incisions, the, gaze, is, deep, due, to, the, heavy, eyelids, and, the, incised, pupils, a, fragmentary, hermaic, stele, next, to, the, portrait, probably, did, once, bear, a, portrait, of, plutarch, since, it, is, inscribed, the, delphians, along, with, the, chaeroneans, dedicated, this, image, of, plutarch, following, the, precepts, of, the, amphictyony, plutarch, s, surviving, works, were, intended, for, greek, speakers, throughout, the, roman, empire, not, just, greeks, plutarch, s, first, biographical, works, were, the, lives, of, the, roman, emperors, from, augustus, to, vitellius, of, these, only, the, lives, of, galba, and, otho, survive, the, lives, of, tiberius, and, nero, are, extant, only, as, fragments, provided, by, damascius, life, of, tiberius, cf, his, life, of, isidore, as, well, as, plutarch, himself, life, of, nero, cf, galba, 2, 1, respectively, these, early, emperors, biographies, were, probably, published, under, the, flavian, dynasty, or, during, the, reign, of, nerva, ad, 96, 98, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, the, two, lives, still, extant, those, of, galba, and, otho, ought, to, be, considered, as, a, single, work, therefore, they, do, not, form, a, part, of, the, plutarchian, canon, of, single, biographies, as, represented, by, the, life, of, aratus, of, sicyon, and, the, life, of, artaxerxes, ii, the, biographies, of, hesiod, pindar, crates, and, daiphantus, were, lost, unlike, in, these, biographies, in, galba, otho, the, individual, characters, of, the, persons, portrayed, are, not, depicted, for, their, own, sake, but, instead, serve, as, an, illustration, of, an, abstract, principle, namely, the, adherence, or, non, adherence, to, plutarch, s, morally, founded, ideal, of, governing, as, a, princeps, cf, galba, 1, 3, moralia, 328d, e, arguing, from, the, perspective, of, platonic, political, philosophy, cf, republic, 375e, 410d, e, 411e, 412a, 442b, c, in, galba, otho, plutarch, reveals, the, constitutional, principles, of, the, principate, in, the, time, of, the, civil, war, after, nero, s, death, while, morally, questioning, the, behavior, of, the, autocrats, he, also, gives, an, impression, of, their, tragic, destinies, ruthlessly, competing, for, the, throne, and, finally, destroying, each, other, the, caesars, house, in, rome, the, palatium, received, in, a, shorter, space, of, time, no, less, than, four, emperors, plutarch, writes, passing, as, it, were, across, the, stage, and, one, making, room, for, another, to, enter, galba, 1, galba, otho, was, handed, down, through, different, channels, it, can, be, found, in, the, appendix, to, plutarch, s, parallel, lives, as, well, as, in, various, moralia, manuscripts, most, prominently, in, maximus, planudes, edition, where, galba, and, otho, appear, as, opera, xxv, and, xxvi, thus, it, seems, reasonable, to, maintain, that, galba, otho, was, from, early, on, considered, as, an, illustration, of, a, moral, ethical, approach, possibly, even, by, plutarch, himself, plutarch, s, best, known, work, is, the, parallel, lives, a, series, of, biographies, of, illustrious, greeks, and, romans, arranged, in, pairs, to, illuminate, their, common, moral, virtues, and, vices, thus, it, being, more, of, an, insight, into, human, nature, than, a, historical, account, the, surviving, lives, contain, 23, pairs, each, with, one, greek, life, and, one, roman, life, as, well, as, four, unpaired, single, lives, as, is, explained, in, the, opening, paragraph, of, his, life, of, alexander, plutarch, was, not, concerned, with, history, so, much, as, the, influence, of, character, good, or, bad, on, the, lives, and, destinies, of, men, whereas, sometimes, he, barely, touched, on, epoch, making, events, he, devoted, much, space, to, charming, anecdote, and, incidental, triviality, reasoning, that, this, often, said, far, more, for, his, subjects, than, even, their, most, famous, accomplishments, he, sought, to, provide, rounded, portraits, likening, his, craft, to, that, of, a, painter, indeed, he, went, to, tremendous, lengths, often, leading, to, tenuous, comparisons, to, draw, parallels, between, physical, appearance, and, moral, character, in, many, ways, he, must, be, counted, amongst, the, earliest, moral, philosophers, some, of, the, lives, such, as, those, of, heracles, philip, ii, of, macedon, epaminondas, scipio, africanus, scipio, aemilianus, and, possibly, quintus, caecilius, metellus, numidicus, no, longer, exist, many, of, the, remaining, lives, are, truncated, contain, obvious, lacunae, or, have, been, tampered, with, by, later, writers, extant, lives, include, those, on, solon, themistocles, aristides, agesilaus, ii, pericles, alcibiades, nicias, demosthenes, pelopidas, philopoemen, timoleon, dion, of, syracuse, eumenes, alexander, the, great, pyrrhus, of, epirus, romulus, numa, pompilius, coriolanus, theseus, aemilius, paullus, tiberius, gracchus, gaius, gracchus, gaius, marius, sulla, sertorius, lucullus, pompey, julius, caesar, cicero, cato, the, elder, mark, antony, and, marcus, junius, brutus, plutarch, s, life, of, alexander, written, as, a, parallel, to, that, of, julius, caesar, is, one, of, five, extant, tertiary, sources, on, the, macedonian, conqueror, alexander, the, great, it, includes, anecdotes, and, descriptions, of, events, that, appear, in, no, other, source, just, as, plutarch, s, portrait, of, numa, pompilius, the, putative, second, king, of, rome, holds, much, that, is, unique, on, the, early, roman, calendar, plutarch, devotes, a, great, deal, of, space, to, alexander, s, drive, and, desire, and, strives, to, determine, how, much, of, it, was, presaged, in, his, youth, he, also, draws, extensively, on, the, work, of, lysippos, alexander, s, favourite, sculptor, to, provide, what, is, probably, the, fullest, and, most, accurate, description, of, the, conqueror, s, physical, appearance, when, it, comes, to, his, character, plutarch, emphasizes, his, unusual, degree, of, self, control, and, scorn, for, luxury, he, desired, not, pleasure, or, wealth, but, only, excellence, and, glory, as, the, narrative, progresses, the, subject, incurs, less, admiration, from, his, biographer, and, the, deeds, that, it, recounts, become, less, savoury, the, murder, of, cleitus, the, black, which, alexander, instantly, and, deeply, regretted, is, commonly, cited, to, this, end, together, with, suetonius, s, the, twelve, caesars, and, caesar, s, own, works, de, bello, gallico, and, de, bello, civili, the, life, of, caesar, is, the, main, account, of, julius, caesar, s, feats, by, ancient, historians, plutarch, starts, by, telling, of, the, audacity, of, caesar, and, his, refusal, to, dismiss, cinna, s, daughter, cornelia, other, important, parts, are, those, containing, his, military, deeds, accounts, of, battles, and, caesar, s, capacity, of, inspiring, the, soldiers, his, soldiers, showed, such, good, will, and, zeal, in, his, service, that, those, who, in, their, previous, campaigns, had, been, in, no, way, superior, to, others, were, invincible, and, irresistible, in, confronting, every, danger, to, enhance, caesar, s, fame, such, a, man, for, instance, was, acilius, who, in, the, sea, fight, at, massalia, boarded, a, hostile, ship, and, had, his, right, hand, cut, off, with, a, sword, but, clung, with, the, other, hand, to, his, shield, and, dashing, it, into, the, faces, of, his, foes, routed, them, all, and, got, possession, of, the, vessel, such, a, man, again, was, cassius, scaeva, who, in, the, battle, at, dyrrhachium, had, his, eye, struck, out, with, an, arrow, his, shoulder, transfixed, with, one, javelin, and, his, thigh, with, another, and, received, on, his, shield, the, blows, of, one, hundred, and, thirty, missiles, in, this, plight, he, called, the, enemy, to, him, as, though, he, would, surrender, two, of, them, accordingly, coming, up, he, lopped, off, the, shoulder, of, one, with, his, sword, smote, the, other, in, the, face, and, put, him, to, flight, and, came, off, safely, himself, with, the, aid, of, his, comrades, again, in, britain, when, the, enemy, had, fallen, upon, the, foremost, centurions, who, had, plunged, into, a, watery, marsh, a, soldier, while, caesar, in, person, was, watching, the, battle, dashed, into, the, midst, of, the, fight, displayed, many, conspicuous, deeds, of, daring, and, rescued, the, centurions, after, the, barbarians, had, been, routed, then, he, himself, making, his, way, with, difficulty, after, all, the, rest, plunged, into, the, muddy, current, and, at, last, without, his, shield, partly, swimming, and, partly, wading, got, across, caesar, and, his, company, were, amazed, and, came, to, meet, the, soldier, with, cries, of, joy, but, he, in, great, dejection, and, with, a, burst, of, tears, cast, himself, at, caesar, s, feet, begging, pardon, for, the, loss, of, his, shield, again, in, africa, scipio, captured, a, ship, of, caesar, s, in, which, granius, petro, who, had, been, appointed, quaestor, was, sailing, of, the, rest, of, the, passengers, scipio, made, booty, but, told, the, quaestor, that, he, offered, him, his, life, granius, however, remarking, that, it, was, the, custom, with, caesar, s, soldiers, not, to, receive, but, to, offer, mercy, killed, himself, with, a, blow, of, his, sword, plutarch, s, life, shows, few, differences, from, suetonius, work, and, caesar, s, own, works, see, de, bello, gallico, and, de, bello, civili, sometimes, plutarch, quotes, directly, from, the, de, bello, gallico, and, even, tells, us, of, the, moments, when, caesar, was, dictating, his, works, in, the, final, part, of, this, life, plutarch, recounts, details, of, caesar, s, assassination, it, ends, by, telling, the, destiny, of, his, murderers, just, after, a, detailed, account, of, the, scene, when, a, phantom, appeared, to, brutus, at, night, plutarch, s, life, of, pyrrhus, is, a, key, text, because, it, is, the, main, historical, account, on, roman, history, for, the, period, from, 293, to, 264, bce, for, which, both, dionysius, and, livy, s, texts, are, lost, it, is, not, histories, i, am, writing, but, lives, and, in, the, most, glorious, deeds, there, is, not, always, an, indication, of, virtue, or, vice, indeed, a, small, thing, like, a, phrase, or, a, jest, often, makes, a, greater, revelation, of, a, character, than, battles, where, thousands, die, life, of, alexander, the, remainder, of, plutarch, s, surviving, work, is, collected, under, the, title, of, the, moralia, loosely, translated, as, customs, and, mores, it, is, an, eclectic, collection, of, seventy, eight, essays, and, transcribed, speeches, including, concerning, the, face, which, appears, in, the, orb, of, the, moon, a, dialogue, on, the, possible, causes, for, such, an, appearance, and, a, source, for, galileo, s, own, work, on, fraternal, affection, a, discourse, on, honour, and, affection, of, siblings, toward, each, other, on, the, fortune, or, the, virtue, of, alexander, the, great, an, important, adjunct, to, his, life, of, the, great, king, and, on, the, worship, of, isis, and, osiris, a, crucial, source, of, information, on, ancient, egyptian, religion, more, philosophical, treatises, such, as, on, the, decline, of, the, oracles, on, the, delays, of, the, divine, vengeance, and, on, peace, of, mind, and, lighter, fare, such, as, odysseus, and, gryllus, a, humorous, dialogue, between, homer, s, odysseus, and, one, of, circe, s, enchanted, pigs, the, moralia, was, composed, first, while, writing, the, lives, occupied, much, of, the, last, two, decades, of, plutarch, s, life, since, spartans, wrote, no, history, prior, to, the, hellenistic, period, their, only, extant, literature, is, fragments, of, 7th, century, lyrics, plutarch, s, five, spartan, lives, and, sayings, of, spartans, and, sayings, of, spartan, women, rooted, in, sources, that, have, since, disappeared, are, some, of, the, richest, sources, for, historians, of, lacedaemonia, while, they, are, important, they, are, also, controversial, plutarch, lived, centuries, after, the, sparta, he, writes, about, and, a, full, millennium, separates, him, from, the, earliest, events, he, records, and, even, though, he, visited, sparta, many, of, the, ancient, customs, he, reports, had, been, long, abandoned, so, he, never, actually, saw, what, he, wrote, about, plutarch, s, sources, themselves, can, be, problematic, as, the, historians, sarah, pomeroy, stanley, burstein, walter, donlan, and, jennifer, tolbert, roberts, have, written, plutarch, was, influenced, by, histories, written, after, the, decline, of, sparta, and, marked, by, nostalgia, for, a, happier, past, real, or, imagined, turning, to, plutarch, himself, they, write, the, admiration, writers, like, plutarch, and, xenophon, felt, for, spartan, society, led, them, to, exaggerate, its, monolithic, nature, minimizing, departures, from, ideals, of, equality, and, obscuring, patterns, of, historical, change, thus, the, spartan, egalitarianism, and, superhuman, immunity, to, pain, that, have, seized, the, popular, imagination, are, likely, myths, and, their, main, architect, is, plutarch, while, flawed, plutarch, is, nonetheless, indispensable, as, one, of, the, only, ancient, sources, of, information, on, spartan, life, pomeroy, et, al, conclude, that, plutarch, s, works, on, sparta, while, they, must, be, treated, with, skepticism, remain, valuable, for, their, large, quantities, of, information, and, these, historians, concede, that, plutarch, s, writings, on, sparta, more, than, those, of, any, other, ancient, author, have, shaped, later, views, of, sparta, despite, their, potential, to, misinform, he, was, also, referenced, in, saying, unto, sparta, the, beast, will, feed, again, book, iv, of, the, moralia, contains, the, roman, and, greek, questions, and, the, customs, of, romans, and, greeks, are, illuminated, in, little, essays, that, pose, questions, such, as, why, were, patricians, not, permitted, to, live, on, the, capitoline, no, 91, and, then, suggests, answers, to, them, in, on, the, malice, of, herodotus, plutarch, criticizes, the, historian, herodotus, for, all, manner, of, prejudice, and, misrepresentation, it, has, been, called, the, first, instance, in, literature, of, the, slashing, review, the, 19th, century, english, historian, george, grote, considered, this, essay, a, serious, attack, upon, the, works, of, herodotus, and, speaks, of, the, honourable, frankness, which, plutarch, calls, his, malignity, plutarch, makes, some, palpable, hits, catching, herodotus, out, in, various, errors, but, it, is, also, probable, that, it, was, merely, a, rhetorical, exercise, in, which, plutarch, plays, devil, s, advocate, to, see, what, could, be, said, against, so, favourite, and, well, known, a, writer, according, to, barrow, 1967, herodotus, real, failing, in, plutarch, s, eyes, was, to, advance, any, criticism, at, all, of, the, city, states, that, saved, greece, from, persia, barrow, concluded, that, plutarch, is, fanatically, biased, in, favor, of, the, greek, cities, they, can, do, no, wrong, the, lost, works, of, plutarch, are, determined, by, references, in, his, own, texts, to, them, and, from, other, authors, references, over, time, parts, of, the, lives, and, what, would, be, considered, parts, of, the, moralia, have, been, lost, the, catalogue, of, lamprias, an, ancient, list, of, works, attributed, to, plutarch, lists, 227, works, of, which, 78, have, come, down, to, us, the, romans, loved, the, lives, enough, copies, were, written, out, over, the, centuries, so, that, a, copy, of, most, of, the, lives, has, survived, to, the, present, day, but, there, are, traces, of, twelve, more, lives, that, are, now, lost, plutarch, s, general, procedure, for, the, lives, was, to, write, the, life, of, a, prominent, greek, then, cast, about, for, a, suitable, roman, parallel, and, end, with, a, brief, comparison, of, the, greek, and, roman, lives, currently, only, 19, of, the, parallel, lives, end, with, a, comparison, while, possibly, they, all, did, at, one, time, also, missing, are, many, of, his, lives, which, appear, in, a, list, of, his, writings, those, of, hercules, the, first, pair, of, parallel, lives, scipio, africanus, and, epaminondas, and, the, companions, to, the, four, solo, biographies, even, the, lives, of, such, important, figures, as, augustus, claudius, and, nero, have, not, been, found, and, may, be, lost, forever, lost, works, that, would, have, been, part, of, the, moralia,

soul, being, eternal, after, death, is, like, a, caged, bird, that, has, been, released, if, it, has, been, a, long, time, in, the, body, and, has, become, tame, by, many, affairs, and, long, habit, the, soul, will, immediately, take, another, body, and, once, again, become, involved, in, the, troubles, of, the, world, the, worst, thing, about, old, age, is, that, the, soul, s, memory, of, the, other, world, grows, dim, while, at, the, same, time, its, attachment, to, things, of, this, world, becomes, so, strong, that, the, soul, tends, to, retain, the, form, that, it, had, in, the, body,

consolation, moralia, plutarch, was, a, platonist, but, was, open, to, the, influence, of, the, peripatetics, and, in, some, details, even, to, stoicism, despite, his, criticism, of, their, principles, he, rejected, only, epicureanism, absolutely, he, attached, little, importance, to, theoretical, questions, and, doubted, the, possibility, of, ever, solving, them, he, was, more, interested, in, moral, and, religious, questions, in, opposition, to, stoic, materialism, and, epicurean, atheism, he, cherished, a, pure, idea, of, god, that, was, more, in, accordance, with, plato, he, adopted, a, second, principle, dyad, in, order, to, explain, the, phenomenal, world, this, principle, he, sought, however, not, in, any, indeterminate, matter, but, in, the, evil, world, soul, which, has, from, the, beginning, been, bound, up, with, matter, but, in, the, creation, was, filled, with, reason, and, arranged, by, it, thus, it, was, transformed, into, the, divine, soul, of, the, world, but, continued, to, operate, as, the, source, of, all, evil, he, elevated, god, above, the, finite, world, and, thus, daemons, became, for, him, agents, of, god, s, influence, on, the, world, he, strongly, defends, freedom, of, the, will, and, the, immortality, of, the, soul, platonic, peripatetic, ethics, were, upheld, by, plutarch, against, the, opposing, theories, of, the, stoics, and, epicureans, the, most, characteristic, feature, of, plutarch, s, ethics, is, its, close, connection, with, religion, however, pure, plutarch, s, idea, of, god, is, and, however, vivid, his, description, of, the, vice, and, corruption, which, superstition, causes, his, warm, religious, feelings, and, his, distrust, of, human, powers, of, knowledge, led, him, to, believe, that, god, comes, to, our, aid, by, direct, revelations, which, we, perceive, the, more, clearly, the, more, completely, that, we, refrain, in, enthusiasm, from, all, action, this, made, it, possible, for, him, to, justify, popular, belief, in, divination, in, the, way, which, had, long, been, usual, among, the, stoics, his, attitude, to, popular, religion, was, similar, the, gods, of, different, peoples, are, merely, different, names, for, one, and, the, same, divine, being, and, the, powers, that, serve, it, the, myths, contain, philosophical, truths, which, can, be, interpreted, allegorically, thus, plutarch, sought, to, combine, the, philosophical, and, religious, conception, of, things, and, to, remain, as, close, as, possible, to, tradition, plutarch, was, the, teacher, of, favorinus,
