of, the, late, pontiff, s, corpse, roncalli, left, venice, for, the, conclave, in, rome, well, aware, that, he, was, papabile, and, after, eleven, ballots, was, elected, to, succeed, the, late, pius, xii, so, it, came, as, no, surprise, to, him, though, he, had, arrived, at, the, vatican, with, a, return, train, ticket, to, venice, many, had, considered, giovanni, battista, montini, the, archbishop, of, milan, a, possible, candidate, but, although, he, was, the, archbishop, of, one, of, the, most, ancient, and, prominent, sees, in, italy, he, had, not, yet, been, made, a, cardinal, though, his, absence, from, the, 1958, conclave, did, not, make, him, ineligible, under, canon, law, any, catholic, male, who, is, capable, of, receiving, priestly, ordination, and, episcopal, consecration, may, be, elected, the, college, of, cardinals, usually, chose, the, new, pontiff, from, among, the, cardinals, who, attend, the, papal, conclave, at, the, time, as, opposed, to, modern, practice, the, participating, cardinals, did, not, have, to, be, below, age, 80, to, vote, there, were, few, eastern, rite, cardinals, and, some, cardinals, were, just, priests, at, the, time, of, their, elevation, roncalli, was, summoned, to, the, final, ballot, of, the, conclave, at, 4, 00, pm, he, was, elected, pope, at, 4, 30, pm, with, a, total, of, 38, votes, after, the, long, pontificate, of, pope, pius, xii, the, cardinals, chose, a, man, who, it, was, presumed, because, of, his, advanced, age, would, be, a, short, term, or, stop, gap, pope, they, wished, to, choose, a, candidate, who, would, do, little, during, the, new, pontificate, upon, his, election, cardinal, eug, ne, tisserant, asked, him, the, ritual, questions, of, whether, he, would, accept, and, if, so, what, name, he, would, take, for, himself, roncalli, gave, the, first, of, his, many, surprises, when, he, chose, john, as, his, regnal, name, roncalli, s, exact, words, were, i, will, be, called, john, this, was, the, first, time, in, over, 500, years, that, this, name, had, been, chosen, previous, popes, had, avoided, its, use, since, the, time, of, the, antipope, john, xxiii, during, the, western, schism, several, centuries, before, on, the, choice, of, his, papal, name, pope, john, xxiii, said, to, the, cardinals, i, will, be, called, john, a, name, sweet, to, us, because, it, is, the, name, of, our, father, dear, to, us, because, it, is, the, name, of, the, humble, parish, church, where, we, were, baptized, the, solemn, name, of, numberless, cathedrals, scattered, throughout, the, world, including, our, own, basilica, twenty, two, johns, of, indisputable, legitimacy, have, and, almost, all, had, a, brief, pontificate, we, have, preferred, to, hide, the, smallness, of, our, name, behind, this, magnificent, succession, of, roman, pontiffs, upon, his, choosing, the, name, there, was, some, confusion, as, to, whether, he, would, be, known, as, john, xxiii, or, john, xxiv, in, response, he, declared, that, he, was, john, xxiii, thus, affirming, the, antipapal, status, of, antipope, john, xxiii, before, this, antipope, the, most, recent, popes, called, john, were, john, xxii, 1316, 1334, and, john, xxi, 1276, 1277, no, pope, john, xx, existed, owing, to, confusion, caused, by, medieval, historians, misreading, the, liber, pontificalis, to, refer, to, another, pope, john, between, john, xiv, and, john, xv, after, his, election, he, confided, in, cardinal, maurice, feltin, that, he, had, chosen, the, name, in, memory, of, france, and, in, the, memory, of, john, xxii, who, continued, the, history, of, the, papacy, in, france, after, he, answered, the, two, ritual, questions, the, traditional, habemus, papam, announcement, was, delivered, by, cardinal, nicola, canali, to, the, people, at, 6, 08, pm, an, exact, hour, after, the, white, smoke, appeared, a, short, while, later, he, appeared, on, the, balcony, and, gave, his, first, urbi, et, orbi, blessing, to, the, crowds, of, the, faithful, below, in, saint, peter, s, square, that, same, night, he, appointed, domenico, tardini, as, his, cardinal, secretary, of, state, of, the, three, cassocks, prepared, for, whoever, the, new, pope, was, even, the, largest, was, not, enough, to, fit, his, obese, frame, which, had, to, be, let, out, in, certain, places, and, only, to, be, held, together, with, great, effort, by, bobby, pins, when, he, first, saw, himself, in, the, mirror, in, his, new, vestments, he, said, with, an, apprising, and, critical, look, that, this, man, will, be, a, disaster, on, television, while, later, saying, he, felt, his, first, appearance, before, the, globe, was, as, if, he, were, a, newborn, babe, in, swaddling, clothes, his, coronation, took, place, on,

successor, in, 1963, taking, the, name, of, paul, vi, that, consistory, was, notable, for, being, the, first, to, expand, the, sacred, college, membership, beyond, the, then, traditional, 70, following, his, election, the, new, pope, told, the, tale, of, how, in, his, first, weeks, he, was, walking, when, he, heard, a, woman, exclaim, in, a, loud, voice, my, god, he, s, so, fat, the, new, pope, casually, remarked, madame, the, holy, conclave, isn, t, exactly, a, beauty, contest, on, 25, december, 1958, he, became, the, first, pope, since, 1870, to, make, pastoral, visits, in, his, diocese, of, rome, when, he, visited, children, infected, with, polio, at, the, bambino, ges, hospital, and, then, visited, santo, spirito, hospital, the, following, day, he, visited, rome, s, regina, coeli, prison, where, he, told, the, inmates, you, could, not, come, to, me, so, i, came, to, you, these, gestures, created, a, sensation, and, he, wrote, in, his, diary, great, astonishment, in, the, roman, italian, and, international, press, i, was, hemmed, in, on, all, sides, authorities, photographers, prisoners, warders, during, these, visits, john, xxiii, put, aside, the, normal, papal, use, of, the, formal, we, when, referring, to, himself, such, as, when, he, visited, a, reformatory, school, for, juvenile, delinquents, in, rome, telling, them, i, have, wanted, to, come, here, for, some, time, the, media, noticed, this, and, reported, that, he, talked, to, the, youths, in, their, own, language, in, international, affairs, his, ostpolitik, engaged, in, dialogue, with, the, communist,

also, sought, to, prevent, nuclear, war, and, tried, to, improve, relations, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, he, began, a, policy, of, dialogue, with, soviet, leaders, in, order, to, seek, conditions, in, which, eastern, catholics, could, find, relief, from, persecution, one, of, the, first, acts, of, pope, john, xxiii, in, 1960, was, to, eliminate, the, description, of, jews, as, perfidius, latin, for, perfidious, or, faithless, in, the, prayer, for, the, conversion, of, the, jews, in, the, good, friday, liturgy, he, interrupted, the, first, good, friday,
