tradition, in, sri, lanka, and, was, composed, in, the, 5th, century, by, buddhagho, a, scholars, are, hesitant, to, make, claims, about, the, historical, facts, of, the, buddha, s, life, most, of, them, accept, that, the, buddha, lived, taught, and, founded, a, monastic, order, during, the, mahajanapada, and, during, the, reign, of, bimbisara, his, friend, protector, and, ruler, of, the, magadha, empire, and, died, during, the, early, years, of, the, reign, of, ajatashatru, who, was, the, successor, of, bimbisara, thus, making, him, a, younger, contemporary, of, mahavira, the, jain, tirthankara, there, is, less, consensus, on, the, veracity, of, many, details, contained, in, traditional, biographies, as, buddhist, scholars, have, mostly, given, up, trying, to, understand, the, historical, person, the, earliest, versions, of, buddhist, biographical, texts, that, we, have, already, contain, many, supernatural, mythical, or, legendary, elements, in, the, 19th, century, some, scholars, simply, omitted, these, from, their, accounts, of, the, life, so, that, the, image, projected, was, of, a, buddha, who, was, a, rational, socratic, teacher, a, great, person, perhaps, but, a, more, or, less, ordinary, human, being, more, recent, scholars, tend, to, see, such, demythologisers, as, remythologisers, creating, a, buddha, that, appealed, to, them, by, eliding, one, that, did, not, the, dates, of, gautama, s, birth, and, death, are, uncertain, within, the, eastern, buddhist, tradition, of, china, vietnam, korea, and, japan, the, traditional, date, for, buddha, s, death, was, 949, bce, but, according, to, the, ka, tan, system, of, the, kalachakra, tradition, buddha, s, death, was, about, 833, bce, buddhist, texts, present, two, chronologies, which, have, been, used, to, date, the, lifetime, of, the, buddha, the, long, chronology, from, sri, lankese, chronicles, states, the, buddha, was, born, 298, years, before, asoka, s, coronation, and, died, 218, years, before, the, coronation, thus, a, lifespan, of, about, 80, years, according, to, these, chronicles, asoka, was, crowned, in, 326, bce, which, gives, buddha, s, lifespan, as, 624, 544, bce, and, are, the, accepted, dates, in, sri, lanka, and, south, east, asia, alternatively, most, scholars, who, also, accept, the, long, chronology, but, date, asoka, s, coronation, around, 268, bce, based, on, greek, evidence, put, the, buddha, s, lifespan, later, at, 566, 486, bce, however, the, short, chronology, from, indian, sources, and, their, chinese, and, tibetan, translations, place, the, buddha, s, birth, at, 180, years, before, asoka, s, coronation, and, death, 100, years, before, the, coronation, still, about, 80, years, following, the, greek, sources, of, asoka, s, coronation, as, 268, bce, this, dates, the, buddha, s, lifespan, even, later, as, 448, 368, bce, most, historians, in, the, early, 20th, century, use, the, earlier, dates, of, 563, 483, bce, differing, from, the, long, chronology, based, on, greek, evidence, by, just, three, years, more, recently, there, are, attempts, to, put, his, death, midway, between, the, long, chronology, s, 480s, bce, and, the, short, chronology, s, 360s, bce, so, circa, 410, bce, at, a, symposium, on, this, question, held, in, 1988, the, majority, of, those, who, presented, gave, dates, within, 20, years, either, side, of, 400, bce, for, the, buddha, s, death, these, alternative, chronologies, however, have, not, been, accepted, by, all, historians, the, dating, of, bimbisara, and, ajatashatru, also, depends, on, the, long, or, short, chronology, in, the, long, chrononology, bimbisara, reigned, c, 558, c, 492, bce, and, died, 492, bce, while, ajatashatru, reigned, c, 492, c, 460, bce, in, the, short, chronology, bimbisara, reigned, c, 400, bce, while, ajatashatru, died, between, c, 380, bce, and, 330, bce, according, to, historian, k, t, s, sarao, a, proponent, of, the, short, chronology, wherein, the, buddha, s, lifespan, was, c, 477, 397, bce, it, can, be, estimated, that, bimbisara, was, reigning, c, 457, 405, bce, and, ajatashatru, was, reigning, c, 405, 373, bce, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, shakyamuni, buddha, was, a, shakya, a, sub, himalayan, ethnicity, and, clan, of, north, eastern, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, shakya, community, was, on, the, periphery, both, geographically, and, culturally, of, the, eastern, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 5th, century, bce, the, community, though, describable, as, a, small, republic, was, probably, an, oligarchy, with, his, father, as, the, elected, chieftain, or, oligarch, the, shakyas, were, widely, considered, to, be, non, vedic, and, hence, impure, in, brahminic, texts, their, origins, remain, speculative, and, debated, bronkhorst, terms, this, culture, which, grew, alongside, aryavarta, without, being, affected, by, the, flourish, of, brahminism, as, greater, magadha, the, buddha, s, tribe, of, origin, the, shakyas, seems, to, have, had, non, vedic, religious, practices, which, persist, in, buddhism, such, as, the, veneration, of, trees, and, sacred, groves, and, the, worship, of, tree, spirits, yakkhas, and, serpent, beings, nagas, they, also, seem, to, have, built, burial, mounds, called, stupas, tree, veneration, remains, important, in, buddhism, today, particularly, in, the, practice, of, venerating, bodhi, trees, likewise, yakkas, and, nagas, have, remained, important, figures, in, buddhist, religious, practices, and, mythology, the, buddha, s, lifetime, coincided, with, the, flourishing, of, influential, rama, a, schools, of, thought, like, j, vika, c, rv, ka, jainism, and, aj, ana, the, brahmajala, sutta, records, sixty, two, such, schools, of, thought, in, this, context, a, rama, a, refers, to, one, who, labours, toils, or, exerts, themselves, for, some, higher, or, religious, purpose, it, was, also, the, age, of, influential, thinkers, like, mahavira, p, ra, a, kassapa, makkhali, gos, la, ajita, kesakambal, pakudha, kacc, yana, and, sa, jaya, bela, haputta, as, recorded, in, sama, aphala, sutta, with, whose, viewpoints, the, buddha, must, have, been, acquainted, riputra, and, moggall, na, two, of, the, foremost, disciples, of, the, buddha, were, formerly, the, foremost, disciples, of, sa, jaya, bela, haputta, the, sceptic, the, p, li, canon, frequently, depicts, buddha, engaging, in, debate, with, the, adherents, of, rival, schools, of, thought, there, is, philological, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, two, masters, alara, kalama, and, uddaka, r, maputta, were, historical, figures, and, they, most, probably, taught, buddha, two, different, forms, of, meditative, techniques, thus, buddha, was, just, one, of, the, many, rama, a, philosophers, of, that, time, in, an, era, where, holiness, of, person, was, judged, by, their, level, of, asceticism, buddha, was, a, reformist, within, the, rama, a, movement, rather, than, a, reactionary, against, vedic, brahminism, coningham, and, young, note, that, both, jains, and, buddhists, used, stupas, while, tree, shrines, can, be, found, in, both, buddhism, and, hinduism, the, rise, of, buddhism, coincided, with, the, second, urbanisation, in, which, the, ganges, basin, was, settled, and, cities, grew, in, which, egalitarianism, prevailed, according, to, thapar, the, buddha, s, teachings, were, also, a, response, to, the, historical, changes, of, the, time, among, which, were, the, emergence, of, the, state, and, the, growth, of, urban, centres, while, the, buddhist, mendicants, renounced, society, they, lived, close, to, the, villages, and, cities, depending, for, alms, givings, on, lay, supporters, according, to, dyson, the, ganges, basin, was, settled, from, the, north, west, and, the, south, east, as, well, as, from, within, together, in, what, is, now, bihar, the, location, of, pataliputra, the, ganges, basin, was, densely, forested, and, the, population, grew, when, new, areas, were, deforestated, and, cultivated, the, society, of, the, middle, ganges, basin, lay, on, the, outer, fringe, of, aryan, cultural, influence, and, differed, significantly, from, the, aryan, society, of, the, western, ganges, basin, according, to, stein, and, burton, he, gods, of, the, brahmanical, sacrificial, cult, were, not, rejected, so, much, as, ignored, by, buddhists, and, their, contemporaries, jainism, and, buddhism, opposed, the, social, stratification, of, brahmanism, and, their, egalitarism, prevailed, in, the, cities, of, the, middle, ganges, basin, this, allowed, jains, and, buddhists, to, engage, in, trade, more, easily, than, brahmans, who, were, forced, to, follow, strict, caste, prohibitions, in, the, earliest, buddhist, texts, the, nik, yas, and, gamas, the, buddha, is, not, depicted, as, possessing, omniscience, sabba, u, nor, is, he, depicted, as, being, an, eternal, transcendent, lokottara, being, according, to, bhikkhu, analayo, ideas, of, the, buddha, s, omniscience, along, with, an, increasing, tendency, to, deify, him, and, his, biography, are, found, only, later, in, the, mahayana, sutras, and, later, pali, commentaries, or, texts, such, as, the, mah, vastu, in, the, sandaka, sutta, the, buddha, s, disciple, ananda, outlines, an, argument, against, the, claims, of, teachers, who, say, they, are, all, knowing, while, in, the, tevijjavacchagotta, sutta, the, buddha, himself, states, that, he, has, never, made, a, claim, to, being, omniscient, instead, he, claimed, to, have, the, higher, knowledges, abhij, the, earliest, biographical, material, from, the, pali, nikayas, focuses, on, the, buddha, s, life, as, a, rama, a, his, search, for, enlightenment, under, various, teachers, such, as, alara, kalama, and, his, forty, five, year, career, as, a, teacher, traditional, biographies, of, gautama, often, include, numerous, miracles, omens, and, supernatural, events, the, character, of, the, buddha, in, these, traditional, biographies, is, often, that, of, a, fully, transcendent, skt, lokottara, and, perfected, being, who, is, unencumbered, by, the, mundane, world, in, the, mah, vastu, over, the, course, of, many, lives, gautama, is, said, to, have, developed, supramundane, abilities, including, a, painless, birth, conceived, without, intercourse, no, need, for, sleep, food, medicine, or, bathing, although, engaging, in, such, in, conformity, with, the, world, omniscience, and, the, ability, to, suppress, karma, as, noted, by, andrew, skilton, the, buddha, was, often, described, as, being, superhuman, including, descriptions, of, him, having, the, 32, major, and, 80, minor, marks, of, a, great, man, and, the, idea, that, the, buddha, could, live, for, as, long, as, an, aeon, if, he, wished, see, dn, 16, the, ancient, indians, were, generally, unconcerned, with, chronologies, being, more, focused, on, philosophy, buddhist, texts, reflect, this, tendency, providing, a, clearer, picture, of, what, gautama, may, have, taught, than, of, the, dates, of, the, events, in, his, life, these, texts, contain, descriptions, of, the, culture, and, daily, life, of, ancient, india, which, can, be, corroborated, from, the, jain, scriptures, and, make, the, buddha, s, time, the, earliest, period, in, indian, history, for, which, significant, accounts, exist, british, author, karen, armstrong, writes, that, although, there, is, very, little, information, that, can, be, considered, historically, sound, we, can, be, reasonably, confident, that, siddh, rtha, gautama, did, exist, as, a, historical, figure, michael, carrithers, goes, further, stating, that, the, most, general, outline, of, birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening, and, liberation, teaching, death, must, be, true, legendary, biographies, like, the, pali, buddhava, sa, and, the, sanskrit, j, takam, l, depict, the, buddha, s, referred, to, as, bodhisattva, before, his, awakening, career, as, spanning, hundreds, of, lifetimes, before, his, last, birth, as, gautama, many, of, these, previous, lives, are, narrated, in, the, jatakas, which, consists, of, 547, stories, the, format, of, a, jataka, typically, begins, by, telling, a, story, in, the, present, which, is, then, explained, by, a, story, of, someone, s, previous, life, besides, imbuing, the, pre, buddhist, past, with, a, deep, karmic, history, the, jatakas, also, serve, to, explain, the, bodhisattva, s, the, buddha, to, be, path, to, buddhahood, in, biographies, like, the, buddhava, sa, this, path, is, described, as, long, and, arduous, taking, four, incalculable, ages, asamkheyyas, in, these, legendary, biographies, the, bodhisattva, goes, through, many, different, births, animal, and, human, is, inspired, by, his, meeting, of, past, buddhas, and, then, makes, a, series, of, resolves, or, vows, pranidhana, to, become, a, buddha, himself, then, he, begins, to, receive, predictions, by, past, buddhas, one, of, the, most, popular, of, these, stories, is, his, meeting, with, dipankara, buddha, who, gives, the, bodhisattva, a, prediction, of, future, buddhahood, another, theme, found, in, the, pali, jataka, commentary, j, taka, hakath, and, the, sanskrit, j, takam, l, is, how, the, buddha, to, be, had, to, practice, several, perfections, p, ramit, to, reach, buddhahood, the, jatakas, also, sometimes, depict, negative, actions, done, in, previous, lives, by, the, bodhisattva, which, explain, difficulties, he, experienced, in, his, final, life, as, gautama, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, gautama, was, born, in, lumbini, now, in, modern, day, nepal, and, raised, in, kapilavastu, the, exact, site, of, ancient, kapilavastu, is, unknown, it, may, have, been, either, piprahwa,

mid, 3rd, century, bce, the, emperor, ashoka, determined, that, lumbini, was, gautama, s, birthplace, and, thus, installed, a, pillar, there, with, the, inscription, this, is, where, the, buddha, sage, of, the, kyas, kyamuni, was, born, according, to, later, biographies, such, as, the, mahavastu, and, the, lalitavistara, his, mother, maya, m, y, dev, suddhodana, s, wife, was, a, princess, from, devdaha, the, ancient, capital, of, the, koliya, kingdom, what, is, now, the, rupandehi, district, of, nepal, legend, has, it, that, on, the, night, siddhartha, was, conceived, queen, maya, dreamt, that, a, white, elephant, with, six, white, tusks, entered, her, right, side, and, ten, months, later, siddhartha, was, born, as, was, the, shakya, tradition, when, his, mother, queen, maya, became, pregnant, she, left, kapilavastu, for, her, father, s, kingdom, to, give, birth, her, son, is, said, to, have, been, born, on, the, way, at, lumbini, in, a, garden, beneath, a, sal, tree, the, earliest, buddhist, sources, state, that, the, buddha, was, born, to, an, aristocratic, kshatriya, pali, khattiya, family, called, gotama, sanskrit, gautama, who, were, part, of, the, shakyas, a, tribe, of, rice, farmers, living, near, the, modern, border, of, india, and, nepal, his, father, uddhodana, was, an, elected, chief, of, the, shakya, clan, whose, capital, was, kapilavastu, and, who, were, later, annexed, by, the, growing, kingdom, of, kosala, during, the, buddha, s, lifetime, the, early, buddhist, texts, contain, very, little, information, about, the, birth, and, youth, of, gotama, buddha, later, biographies, developed, a, dramatic, narrative, about, the, life, of, the, young, gotama, as, a, prince, and, his, existential, troubles, they, depict, his, father, uddhodana, as, a, hereditary, monarch, of, the, suryavansha, solar, dynasty, of, ik, v, ku, p, li, okk, ka, this, is, unlikely, as, many, scholars, think, that, uddhodana, was, merely, a, shakya, aristocrat, khattiya, and, that, the, shakya, republic, was, not, a, hereditary, monarchy, the, more, egalitarian, ga, asa, gha, form, of, government, as, a, political, alternative, to, indian, monarchies, may, have, influenced, the, development, of, the, ramanic, jain, and, buddhist, sanghas, where, monarchies, tended, toward, vedic, brahmanism, the, day, of, the, buddha, s, birth, enlightenment, and, death, is, widely, celebrated, in, theravada, countries, as, vesak, and, the, day, he, got, conceived, as, poson, buddha, s, birthday, is, called, buddha, purnima, in, nepal, bangladesh, and, india,

the, first, arhat, other, than, the, buddha, was, reputed, to, be, the, only, one, who, unequivocally, predicted, that, siddhartha, would, become, a, buddha, early, texts, suggest, that, gautama, was, not, familiar, with, the, dominant, religious, teachings, of, his, time, until, he, left, on, his, religious, quest, which, is, said, to, have, been, motivated, by, existential, concern, for, the, human, condition, according, to, the, early, buddhist, texts, of, several, schools, and, numerous, post, canonical, accounts, gotama, had, a, wife, yasodhara, and, a, son, named, r, hula, besides, this, the, buddha, in, the, early, texts, reports, that, i, lived, a, spoilt, a, very, spoilt, life, monks, in, my, parents, home, the, legendary, biographies, like, the, lalitavistara, also, tell, stories, of, young, gotama, s, great, martial, skill, which, was, put, to, the, test, in, various, contests, against, other, shakyan, youths, while, the, earliest, sources, merely, depict, gotama, seeking, a, higher, spiritual, goal, and, becoming, an, ascetic, or, rama, a, after, being, disillusioned, with, lay, life, the, later, legendary, biographies, tell, a, more, elaborate, dramatic, story, about, how, he, became, a, mendicant, the, earliest, accounts, of, the, buddha, s, spiritual, quest, is, found, in, texts, such, as, the, pali, ariyapariyesan, sutta, the, discourse, on, the, noble, quest, mn, 26, and, its, chinese, parallel, at, m, 204, these, texts, report, that, what, led, to, gautama, s, renunciation, was, the, thought, that, his, life, was, subject, to, old, age, disease, and, death, and, that, there, might, be, something, better, the, early, texts, also, depict, the, buddha, s, explanation, for, becoming, a, sramana, as, follows, the, household, life, this, place, of, impurity, is, narrow, the, samana, life, is, the, free, open, air, it, is, not, easy, for, a, householder, to, lead, the, perfected, utterly, pure, and, perfect, holy, life, mn, 26, m, 204, the, dharmaguptaka, vinaya, and, the, mah, vastu, all, agree, that, his, mother, and, father, opposed, his, decision, and, wept, with, tearful, faces, when, he, decided, to, leave, legendary, biographies, also, tell, the, story, of, how, gautama, left, his, palace, to, see, the, outside, world, for, the, first, time, and, how, he, was, shocked, by, his, encounter, with, human, suffering, these, depict, gautama, s, father, as, shielding, him, from, religious, teachings, and, from, knowledge, of, human, suffering, so, that, he, would, become, a, great, king, instead, of, a, great, religious, leader, in, the, nidanakatha, 5th, century, ce, gautama, is, said, to, have, seen, an, old, man, when, his, charioteer, chandaka, explained, to, him, that, all, people, grew, old, the, prince, went, on, further, trips, beyond, the, palace, on, these, he, encountered, a, diseased, man, a, decaying, corpse, and, an, ascetic, that, inspired, him, this, story, of, the, four, sights, seems, to, be, adapted, from, an, earlier, account, in, the, digha, nikaya, dn, 14, 2, which, instead, depicts, the, young, life, of, a, previous, buddha, vipassi, the, legendary, biographies, depict, gautama, s, departure, from, his, palace, as, follows, shortly, after, seeing, the, four, sights, gautama, woke, up, at, night, and, saw, his, female, servants, lying, in, unattractive, corpse, like, poses, which, shocked, him, therefore, he, discovered, what, he, would, later, understand, more, deeply, during, his, enlightenment, dukkha, standing, unstable, dissatisfaction, and, the, end, of, dukkha, moved, by, all, the, things, he, had, experienced, he, decided, to, leave, the, palace, in, the, middle, of, the, night, against, the, will, of, his, father, to, live, the, life, of, a,

anomiya, and, cut, off, his, hair, leaving, his, servant, and, horse, behind, he, journeyed, into, the, woods, and, changed, into, monk, s, robes, there, though, in, some, other, versions, of, the, story, he, received, the, robes, from, a, brahma, deity, at, anomiya, according, to, the, legendary, biographies, when, the, ascetic, gautama, first, went, to, rajagaha, present, day, rajgir, to, beg, for, alms, in, the, streets, king, bimbisara, of, magadha, learned, of, his, quest, and, offered, him, a, share, of, his, kingdom, gautama, rejected, the, offer, but, promised, to, visit, his, kingdom, first, upon, attaining, enlightenment, majjhima, nikaya, 4, mentions, that, gautama, lived, in, remote, jungle, thickets, during, his, years, of, spiritual, striving, and, had, to, overcome, the, fear, that, he, felt, while, living, in, the, forests, the, nikaya, texts, narrate, that, the, ascetic, gautama, practised, under, two, teachers, of, yogic, meditation, according, to, the, ariyapariyesan, sutta, mn, 26, and, its, chinese, parallel, at, m, 204, after, having, mastered, the, teaching, of, r, a, k, l, ma, pali, alara, kalama, who, taught, a, meditation, attainment, called, the, sphere, of, nothingness, he, was, asked, by, r, a, to, become, an, equal, leader, of, their, spiritual, community, gautama, felt, unsatisfied, by, the, practice, because, it, does, not, lead, to, revulsion, to, dispassion, to, cessation, to, calm, to, knowledge, to, awakening, to, nibbana, and, moved, on, to, become, a, student, of, udraka, r, maputra, pali, udaka, ramaputta, with, him, he, achieved, high, levels, of, meditative, consciousness, called, the, sphere, of, neither, perception, nor, non, perception, and, was, again, asked, to, join, his, teacher, but, once, more, he, was, not, satisfied, for, the, same, reasons, as, before, and, moved, on, according, to, some, sutras, after, leaving, his, meditation, teachers, gotama, then, practiced, ascetic, techniques, the, ascetic, techniques, described, in, the, early, texts, include, very, minimal, food, intake, different, forms, of, breath, control, and, forceful, mind, control, the, texts, report, that, he, became, so, emaciated, that, his, bones, became, visible, through, his, skin, the, mah, saccaka, sutta, and, most, of, its, parallels, agree, that, after, taking, asceticism, to, its, extremes, gautama, realized, that, this, had, not, helped, him, attain, nirvana, and, that, he, needed, to, regain, strength, to, pursue, his, goal, one, popular, story, tells, of, how, he, accepted, milk, and, rice, pudding, from, a, village, girl, named, sujata, according, to, the, his, break, with, asceticism, led, his, five, companions, to, abandon, him, since, they, believed, that, he, had, abandoned, his, search, and, become, undisciplined, at, this, point, gautama, remembered, a, previous, experience, of, dhyana, meditation, he, had, as, a, child, sitting, under, a, tree, while, his, father, worked, this, memory, leads, him, to, understand, that, dhyana, is, the, path, to, liberation, and, the, texts, then, depict, the, buddha, achieving, all, four, dhyanas, followed, by, the, three, higher, knowledges, tevijja, culminating, in, complete, insight, into, the, four, noble, truths, thereby, attaining, liberation, from, samsara, the, endless, cycle, of, rebirth, according, to, the, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, sn, 56, the, tathagata, the, term, gautama, uses, most, often, to, refer, to, himself, realized, the, middle, way, a, path, of, moderation, away, from, the, extremes, of, self, indulgence, and, self, mortification, or, the, noble, eightfold, path, in, later, centuries, gautama, became, known, as, the, buddha, or, awakened, one, the, title, indicates, that, unlike, most, people, who, are, asleep, a, buddha, is, understood, as, having, woken, up, to, the, true, nature, of, reality, and, sees, the, world, as, it, is, yatha, bhutam, a, buddha, has, achieved, liberation, vimutti, also, called, nirvana, which, is, seen, as, the, extinguishing, of, the, fires, of, desire, hatred, and, ignorance, that, keep, the, cycle, of, suffering, and, rebirth, going, following, his, decision, to, leave, his, meditation, teachers, m, 204, and, other, parallel, early, texts, report, that, gautama, sat, down, with, the, determination, not, to, get, up, until, full, awakening, samm, sambodhi, had, been, reached, the, ariyapariyesan, sutta, does, not, mention, full, awakening, but, only, that, he, attained, nirvana, in, buddhist, tradition, this, event, was, said, to, have, occurred, under, a, pipal, tree, known, as, the, bodhi, tree, in, bodh, gaya, bihar, as, reported, by, various, texts, from, the, pali, canon, the, buddha, sat, for, seven, days, under, the, bodhi, tree, feeling, the, bliss, of, deliverance, the, pali, texts, also, report, that, he, continued, to, meditate, and, contemplated, various, aspects, of, the, dharma, while, living, by, the, river, naira, jan, such, as, dependent, origination, the, five, spiritual, faculties, and, suffering, dukkha, the, legendary, biographies, like, the, mahavastu, nidanakatha, and, the, lalitavistara, depict, an, attempt, by, mara, the, ruler, of, the, desire, realm, to, prevent, the, buddha, s, nirvana, he, does, so, by, sending, his, daughters, to, seduce, the, buddha, by, asserting, his, superiority, and, by, assaulting, him, with, armies, of, monsters, however, the, buddha, is, unfazed, and, calls, on, the, earth, or, in, some, versions, of, the, legend, the, earth, goddess, as, witness, to, his, superiority, by, touching, the, ground, before, entering, meditation, other, miracles, and, magical, events, are, also, depicted, according, to, mn, 26, immediately, after, his, awakening, the, buddha, hesitated, on, whether, or, not, he, should, teach, the, dharma, to, others, he, was, concerned, that, humans, were, overpowered, by, ignorance, greed, and, hatred, that, it, would, be, difficult, for, them, to, recognise, the, path, which, is, subtle, deep, and, hard, to, grasp, however, the, god, brahm, sahampati, convinced, him, arguing, that, at, least, some, with, little, dust, in, their, eyes, will, understand, it, the, buddha, relented, and, agreed, to, teach, according, to, an, layo, the, chinese, parallel, to, mn, 26, m, 204, does, not, contain, this, story, but, this, event, does, appear, in, other, parallel, texts, such, as, in, an, ekottarika, gama, discourse, in, the, catusparisat, s, tra, and, in, the, lalitavistara, according, to, mn, 26, and, m, 204, after, deciding, to, teach, the, buddha, initially, intended, to, visit, his, former, teachers, alara, kalama, and, udaka, ramaputta, to, teach, them, his, insights, but, they, had, already, died, so, he, decided, to, visit, his, five, former, companions, mn, 26, and, m, 204, both, report, that, on, his, way, to, v, r, nas, benares, he, met, another, wanderer, an, j, vika,

with, the, buddha, reaching, the, deer, park, sarnath, mrigad, va, also, called, rishipatana, site, where, the, ashes, of, the, ascetics, fell, near, v, r, nas, where, he, met, the, group, of, five, ascetics, and, was, able, to, convince, them, that, he, had, indeed, reached, full, awakening, according, to, m, 204, but, not, mn, 26, as, well, as, the, therav, da, vinaya, an, ekottarika, gama, text, the, dharmaguptaka, vinaya, the, mah, saka, vinaya, and, the, mah, vastu, the, buddha, then, taught, them, the, first, sermon, also, known, as, the, benares, sermon, i, e, the, teaching, of, the, noble, eightfold, path, as, the, middle, path, aloof, from, the, two, extremes, of, sensual, indulgence, and, self, mortification, the, pali, text, reports, that, after, the, first, sermon, the, ascetic, ko, a, a, kaundinya, became, the, first, arahant, liberated, being, and, the, first, buddhist, bhikkhu, or, monastic, the, buddha, then, continued, to, teach, the, other, ascetics, and, they, formed, the, first, sa, gha, the, company, of, buddhist, monks, various, sources, such, as, the, mah, vastu, the, mah, khandhaka, of, the, therav, da, vinaya, and, the, catusparisat, s, tra, also, mention, that, the, buddha, taught, them, his, second, discourse, about, the, characteristic, of, not, self, an, tmalak, a, a, s, tra, at, this, time, or, five, days, later, after, hearing, this, second, sermon, the, four, remaining, ascetics, also, reached, the, status, of, arahant, the, therav, da, vinaya, and, the, catusparisat, s, tra, also, speak, of, the, conversion, of, yasa, a, local, guild, master, and, his, friends, and, family, who, were, some, of, the, first, laypersons, to, be, converted, and, to, enter, the, buddhist, community, the, conversion, of, three, brothers, named, kassapa, followed, who, brought, with, them, five, hundred, converts, who, had, previously, been, matted, hair, ascetics, and, whose, spiritual, practice, was, related, to, fire, sacrifices, according, to, the, therav, da, vinaya, the, buddha, then, stopped, at, the, gayasisa, hill, near, gaya, and, delivered, his, third, discourse, the, dittapariy, ya, sutta, the, discourse, on, fire, in, which, he, taught, that, everything, in, the, world, is, inflamed, by, passions, and, only, those, who, follow, the, eightfold, path, can, be, liberated, at, the, end, of, the, rainy, season, when, the, buddha, s, community, had, grown, to, around, sixty, awakened, monks, he, instructed, them, to, wander, on, their, own, teach, and, ordain, people, into, the, community, for, the, welfare, and, benefit, of, the, world, for, the, remaining, 40, or, 45, years, of, his, life, the, buddha, is, said, to, have, travelled, in, the, gangetic, plain, in, what, is, now, uttar, pradesh, bihar, and, southern, nepal, teaching, a, diverse, range, of, people, from, nobles, to, servants, ascetics, and, householders, murderers, such, as, angulimala, and, cannibals, such, as, alavaka, according, to, schumann, the, buddha, s, travels, ranged, from, kosambi, on, the, yamuna, 25, km, south, west, of, allahabad, to, campa, 40, km, east, of, bhagalpur, and, from, kapilavatthu, 95, km, north, west, of, gorakhpur, to, uruvela, south, of, gaya, this, covers, an, area, of, 600, by, 300, km, his, sangha, enjoyed, the, patronage, of, the, kings, of, kosala, and, magadha, and, he, thus, spent, a, lot, of, time, in, their, respective, capitals, savatthi, and, rajagaha, although, the, buddha, s, language, remains, unknown, it, is, likely, that, he, taught, in, one, or, more, of, a, variety, of, closely, related, middle, indo, aryan, dialects, of, which, pali, may, be, a, standardisation, the, sangha, wandered, throughout, the, year, except, during, the, four, months, of, the, vassa, rainy, season, when, ascetics, of, all, religions, rarely, travelled, one, reason, was, that, it, was, more, difficult, to, do, so, without, causing, harm, to, flora, and, animal, life, the, health, of, the, ascetics, might, have, been, a, concern, as, well, at, this, time, of, year, the, sangha, would, retreat, to, monasteries, public, parks, or, forests, where, people, would, come, to, them, the, first, vassana, was, spent, at, varanasi, when, the, sangha, was, formed, according, to, the, pali, texts, shortly, after, the, formation, of, the, sangha, the, buddha, travelled, to, rajagaha, capital, of, magadha, and, met, with, king, bimbisara, who, gifted, a, bamboo, grove, park, to, the, sangha, the, buddha, s, sangha, continued, to, grow, during, his, initial, travels, in, north, india, the, early, texts, tell, the, story, of, how, the, buddha, s, chief, disciples, s, riputta, and, mah, moggall, na, who, were, both, students, of, the, skeptic, sramana, sa, jaya, bela, hiputta, were, converted, by, assaji, they, also, tell, of, how, the, buddha, s, son, rahula, joined, his, father, as, a, bhikkhu, when, the, buddha, visited, his, old, home, kapilavastu, over, time, other, shakyans, joined, the, order, as, bhikkhus, such, as, buddha, s, cousin, ananda, anuruddha, upali, the, barber, the, buddha, s, half, brother, nanda, and, devadatta, meanwhile, the, buddha, s, father, suddhodana, heard, his, son, s, teaching, converted, to, buddhism, and, became, a, stream, enterer, the, early, texts, also, mention, an, important, lay, disciple, the, merchant, an, thapi, ika, who, became, a, strong, lay, supporter, of, the, buddha, early, on, he, is, said, to, have, gifted, jeta, s, grove, jetavana, to, the, sangha, at, great, expense, the, theravada, vinaya, speaks, of, thousands, of, gold, coins, the, formation, of, a, parallel, order, of, female, monastics, bhikkhun, was, another, important, part, of, the, growth, of, the, buddha, s, community, as, noted, by, an, layo, s, comparative, study, of, this, topic, there, are, various, versions, of, this, event, depicted, in, the, different, early, buddhist, texts, according, to, all, the, major, versions, surveyed, by, an, layo, mah, praj, pat, gautam, buddha, s, step, mother, is, initially, turned, down, by, the, buddha, after, requesting, ordination, for, her, and, some, other, women, mah, praj, pat, and, her, followers, then, shave, their, hair, don, robes, and, begin, following, the, buddha, on, his, travels, the, buddha, is, eventually, convinced, by, nanda, to, grant, ordination, to, mah, praj, pat, on, her, acceptance, of, eight, conditions, called, gurudharmas, which, focus, on, the, relationship, between, the, new, order, of, nuns, and, the, monks, according, to, an, layo, the, only, argument, common, to, all, the, versions, that, ananda, uses, to, convince, the, buddha, is, that, women, have, the, same, ability, to, reach, all, stages, of, awakening, an, layo, also, notes, that, some, modern, scholars, have, questioned, the, authenticity, of, the, eight, gurudharmas, in, their, present, form, due, to, various, inconsistencies, he, holds, that, the, historicity, of, the, current, lists, of, eight, is, doubtful, but, that, they, may, have, been, based, on, earlier, injunctions, by, the, buddha, an, layo, notes, that, various, passages, indicate, that, the, reason, for, the, buddha, s, hesitation, to, ordain, women, was, the, danger, that, the, life, of, a, wandering, sramana, posed, for, women, that, were, not, under, the, protection, of, their, male, family, members, such, as, dangers, of, sexual, assault, and, abduction, due, to, this, the, gurudharma, injunctions, may, have, been, a, way, to, place, the, newly, founded, order, of, nuns, in, a, relationship, to, its, male, counterparts, that, resembles, as, much, as, possible, the, protection, a, laywoman, could, expect, from, her, male, relatives, according, to, j, s, strong, after, the, first, 20, years, of, his, teaching, career, the, buddha, seems, to, have, slowly, settled, in, sravasti, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, kosala, spending, most, of, his, later, years, in, this, city, as, the, sangha, grew, in, size, the, need, for, a, standardized, set, of, monastic, rules, arose, and, the, buddha, seems, to, have, developed, a, set, of, regulations, for, the, sangha, these, are, preserved, in, various, texts, called, pratimoksa, which, were, recited, by, the, community, every, fortnight, the, pratimoksa, includes, general, ethical, precepts, as, well, as, rules, regarding, the, essentials, of, monastic, life, such, as, bowls, and, robes, in, his, later, years, the, buddha, s, fame, grew, and, he, was, invited, to, important, royal, events, such, as, the, inauguration, of, the, new, council, hall, of, the, shakyans, as, seen, in, mn, 53, and, the, inauguration, of, a, new, palace, by, prince, bodhi, as, depicted, in, mn, 85, the, early, texts, also, speak, of, how, during, the, buddha, s, old, age, the, kingdom, of, magadha, was, usurped, by, a, new, king, ajatashatru, who, overthrew, his, father, bimbisara, according, to, the, sama, aphala, sutta, the, new, king, spoke, with, different, ascetic, teachers, and, eventually, took, refuge, in, the, buddha, however, jain, sources, also, claim, his, allegiance, and, it, is, likely, he, supported, various, religious, groups, not, just, the, buddha, s, sangha, exclusively, as, the, buddha, continued, to, travel, and, teach, he, also, came, into, contact, with, members, of, other, r, mana, sects, there, is, evidence, from, the, early, texts, that, the, buddha, encountered, some, of, these, figures, and, critiqued, their, doctrines, the, sama, aphala, sutta, identifies, six, such, sects, the, early, texts, also, depict, the, elderly, buddha, as, suffering, from, back, pain, several, texts, depict, him, delegating, teachings, to, his, chief, disciples, since, his, body, now, needed, more, rest, however, the, buddha, continued, teaching, well, into, his, old, age, one, of, the, most, troubling, events, during, the, buddha, s, old, age, was, devadatta, s, schism, early, sources, speak, of, how, the, buddha, s, cousin, devadatta, attempted, to, take, over, leadership, of, the, order, and, then, left, the, sangha, with, several, buddhist, monks, and, formed, a, rival, sect, this, sect, is, said, to, have, been, supported, by, king, ajatashatru, the, pali, texts, depict, devadatta, as, plotting, to, kill, the, buddha, but, these, plans, all, fail, they, depict, the, buddha, as, sending, his, two, chief, disciples, sariputta, and, moggallana, to, this, schismatic, community, in, order, to, convince, the, monks, who, left, with, devadatta, to, return, all, the, major, early, buddhist, vinaya, texts, depict, devadatta, as, a, divisive, figure, who, attempted, to, split, the, buddhist, community, but, they, disagree, on, what, issues, he, disagreed, with, the, buddha, on, the, sthavira, texts, generally, focus, on, five, points, which, are, seen, as, excessive, ascetic, practices, while, the, mah, sa, ghika, vinaya, speaks, of, a, more, comprehensive, disagreement, which, has, devadatta, alter, the, discourses, as, well, as, monastic, discipline, at, around, the, same, time, of, devadatta, s, schism, there, was, also, war, between, ajatashatru, s, kingdom, of, magadha, and, kosala, led, by, an, elderly, king, pasenadi, ajatashatru, seems, to, have, been, victorious, a, turn, of, events, the, buddha, is, reported, to, have, regretted, the, main, narrative, of, the, buddha, s, last, days, death, and, the, events, following, his, death, is, contained, in, the, mahaparinibbana, sutta, dn, 16, and, its, various, parallels, in, sanskrit, chinese, and, tibetan, according, to, an, layo, these, include, the, chinese, dirgha, agama, 2, sanskrit, fragments, of, the, mahaparinirvanasutra, and, three, discourses, preserved, as, individual, translations, in, chinese, the, mahaparinibbana, sutta, depicts, the, buddha, s, last, year, as, a, time, of, war, it, begins, with, ajatashatru, s, decision, to, make, war, on, the, vajjika, league, leading, him, to, send, a, minister, to, ask, the, buddha, for, advice, the, buddha, responds, by, saying, that, the, vajjikas, can, be, expected, to, prosper, as, long, as, they, do, seven, things, and, he, then, applies, these, seven, principles, to, the, buddhist, sangha, showing, that, he, is, concerned, about, its, future, welfare, the, buddha, says, that, the, sangha, will, prosper, as, long, as, they, hold, regular, and, frequent, assemblies, meet, in, harmony, do, not, change, the, rules, of, training, honour, their, superiors, who, were, ordained, before, them, do, not, fall, prey, to, worldly, desires, remain, devoted, to, forest, hermitages, and, preserve, their, personal, mindfulness, he, then, gives, further, lists, of, important, virtues, to, be, upheld, by, the, sangha, the, early, texts, depict, how, the, buddha, s, two, chief, disciples, sariputta, and, moggallana, died, just, before, the, buddha, s, death, the, mahaparinibbana, depicts, the, buddha, as, experiencing, illness, during, the, last, months, of, his, life, but, initially, recovering, it, depicts, him, as, stating, that, he, cannot, promote, anyone, to, be, his, successor, when, nanda, requested, this, the, mahaparinibbana, records, his, response, as, follows, ananda, why, does, the, order, of, monks, expect, this, of, me, i, have, taught, the, dhamma, making, no, distinction, of, inner, and, outer, the, tathagata, has, no, teacher, s, fist, in, which, certain, truths, are, held, back, if, there, is, anyone, who, thinks, i, shall, take, charge, of, the, order, or, the, order, is, under, my, leadership, such, a, person, would, have, to, make, arrangements, about, the, order, the, tathagata, does, not, think, in, such, terms, why, should, the, tathagata, make, arrangements, for, the, order, i, am, now, old, worn, out, i, have, reached, the, term, of, life, i, am, turning, eighty, years, of, age, just, as, an, old, cart, is, made, to, go, by, being, held, together, with, straps, so, the, tathagata, s, body, is, kept, going, by, being, bandaged, up, therefore, ananda, you, should, live, as, islands, unto, yourselves, being, your, own, refuge, seeking, no, other, refuge, with, the, dhamma, as, an, island, with, the, dhamma, as, your, refuge, seeking, no, other, refuge, those, monks, who, in, my, time, or, afterwards, live, thus, seeking, an, island, and, a, refuge, in, themselves, and, in, the, dhamma, and, nowhere, else, these, zealous, ones, are, truly, my, monks, and, will, overcome, the, darkness, of, rebirth, after, travelling, and, teaching, some, more, the, buddha, ate, his, last, meal, which, he, had, received, as, an, offering, from, a, blacksmith, named, cunda, falling, violently, ill, buddha, instructed, his, attendant, nanda, to, convince, cunda, that, the, meal, eaten, at, his, place, had, nothing, to, do, with, his, death, and, that, his, meal, would, be, a, source, of, the, greatest, merit, as, it, provided, the, last, meal, for, a, buddha, bhikkhu, mettanando, and, oskar, von, hin, ber, argue, that, the, buddha, died, of, mesenteric, infarction, a, symptom, of, old, age, rather, than, food, poisoning, the, precise, contents, of, the, buddha, s, final, meal, are, not, clear, due, to, variant, scriptural, traditions, and, ambiguity, over, the, translation, of, certain, significant, terms, the, theravada, tradition, generally, believes, that, the, buddha, was, offered, some, kind, of, pork, while, the, mahayana, tradition, believes, that, the, buddha, consumed, some, sort, of, truffle, or, other, mushroom, these, may, reflect, the, different, traditional, views, on, buddhist, vegetarianism, and, the, precepts, for, monks, and, nuns, modern, scholars, also, disagree, on, this, topic, arguing, both, for, pig, s, flesh, or, some, kind, of, plant, or, mushroom, that, pigs, like, to, eat, whatever, the, case, none, of, the, sources, which, mention, the, last, meal, attribute, the, buddha, s, sickness, to, the, meal, itself, as, per, the, mahaparinibbana, sutta, after, the, meal, with, cunda, the, buddha, and, his, companions, continued, travelling, until, he, was, too, weak, to, continue, and, had, to, stop, at, kushinagar, where, nanda, had, a, resting, place, prepared, in, a, grove, of, sala, trees, after, announcing, to, the, sangha, at, large, that, he, would, soon, be, passing, away, to, final, nirvana, the, buddha, ordained, one, last, novice, into, the, order, personally, his, name, was, subhadda, he, then, repeated, his, final, instructions, to, the, sangha, which, was, that, the, dhamma, and, vinaya, was, to, be, their, teacher, after, his, death, then, he, asked, if, anyone, had, any, doubts, about, the, teaching, but, nobody, did, the, buddha, s, final, words, are, reported, to, have, been, all, sa, kh, ras, decay, strive, for, the, goal, with, diligence, appam, da, pali, vayadhamm, sa, kh, r, appam, dena, samp, deth, he, then, entered, his, final, meditation, and, died, reaching, what, is, known, as, parinirvana, final, nirvana, instead, of, a, person, being, reborn, the, five, aggregates, of, physical, and, mental, phenomena, that, constitute, a, being, cease, to, occur, the, mahaparinibbana, reports, that, in, his, final, meditation, he, entered, the, four, dhyanas, consecutively, then, the, four, immaterial, attainments, and, finally, the, meditative, dwelling, known, as, nirodha, sam, patti, before, returning, to, the, fourth, dhyana, right, at, the, moment, of, death, according, to, the, mahaparinibbana, sutta, the, mallians, of, kushinagar, spent, the, days, following, the, buddha, s, death, honouring, his, body, with, flowers, music, and, scents, the, sangha, waited, until, the, eminent, elder, mah, kassapa, arrived, to, pay, his, respects, before, cremating, the, body, the, buddha, s, body, was, then, cremated, and, the, remains, including, his, bones, were, kept, as, relics, and, they, were, distributed, among, various, north, indian, kingdoms, like, magadha, shakya, and, koliya, these, relics, were, placed, in, monuments, or, mounds, called, stupas, a, common, funerary, practice, at, the, time, centuries, later, they, would, be, exhumed, and, enshrined, by, ashoka, into, many, new, stupas, around, the, mauryan, realm, many, supernatural, legends, surround, the, history, of, alleged, relics, as, they, accompanied, the, spread, of, buddhism, and, gave, legitimacy, to, rulers, according, to, various, buddhist, sources, the, first, buddhist, council, was, held, shortly, after, the, buddha, s, death, to, collect, recite, and, memorize, the, teachings, mah, kassapa, was, chosen, by, the, sangha, to, be, the, chairman, of, the, council, however, the, historicity, of, the, traditional, accounts, of, the, first, council, is, disputed, by, modern, scholars, a, number, of, teachings, and, practices, are, deemed, essential, to, buddhism, including, the, samyojana, fetters, chains, or, bounds, that, is, the, sankharas, formations, the, kleshas, unwholesome, mental, states, including, the, three, poisons, and, the, savas, influx, canker, that, perpetuate, sa, s, ra, the, repeated, cycle, of, becoming, the, six, sense, bases, and, the, five, aggregates, which, describe, the, process, from, sense, contact, to, consciousness, which, lead, to, this, bondage, to, sa, s, ra, dependent, origination, which, describes, this, process, and, its, reversal, in, detail, and, the, middle, way, with, the, four, noble, truths, and, the, noble, eightfold, path, which, prescribes, how, this, bondage, can, be, reversed, according, to, n, ross, reat, the, theravada, pali, texts, and, the, mahasamghika, school, s, listamba, s, tra, share, these, basic, teachings, and, practices, bhikkhu, analayo, concludes, that, the, theravada, majjhima, nikaya, and, sarvastivada, madhyama, agama, contain, mostly, the, same, major, doctrines, likewise, richard, salomon, has, written, that, the, doctrines, found, in, the, gandharan, manuscripts, are, consistent, with, non, mahayana, buddhism, which, survives, today, in, the, theravada, school, of, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, but, which, in, ancient, times, was, represented, by, eighteen, separate, schools, all, beings, have, deeply, entrenched, samyojana, fetters, chains, or, bounds, that, is, the, sankharas, formations, kleshas, unwholesome, mental, states, including, the, three, poisons, and, savas, influx, canker, that, perpetuate, sa, s, ra, the, repeated, cycle, of, becoming, and, rebirth, according, to, the, pali, suttas, the, buddha, stated, that, this, sa, s, ra, is, without, discoverable, beginning, a, first, point, is, not, discerned, of, beings, roaming, and, wandering, on, hindered, by, ignorance, and, fettered, by, craving, in, the, dutiyalokadhammasutta, sutta, an, 8, 6, the, buddha, explains, how, eight, worldly, winds, keep, the, world, turning, around, gain, and, loss, fame, and, disrepute, praise, and, blame, pleasure, and, pain, he, then, explains, how, the, difference, between, a, noble, arya, person, and, an, uninstructed, worldling, is, that, a, noble, person, reflects, on, and, understands, the, impermanence, of, these, conditions, this, cycle, of, becoming, is, characterized, by, dukkha, commonly, referred, to, as, suffering, dukkha, is, more, aptly, rendered, as, unsatisfactoriness, or, unease, it, is, the, unsatisfactoriness, and, unease, that, comes, with, a, life, dictated, by, automatic, responses, and, habituated, selfishness, and, the, unsatifacories, of, expecting, enduring, happiness, from, things, which, are, impermanent, unstable, and, thus, unreliable, the, ultimate, noble, goal, should, be, liberation, from, this, cycle, samsara, is, dictated, by, karma, which, is, an, impersonal, natural, law, similar, to, how, certain, seeds, produce, certain, plants, and, fruits, karma, is, not, the, only, cause, for, one, s, conditions, as, the, buddha, listed, various, physical, and, environmental, causes, alongside, karma, the, buddha, s, teaching, of, karma, differed, to, that, of, the, jains, and, brahmins, in, that, on, his, view, karma, is, primarily, mental, intention, as, opposed, to, mainly, physical, action, or, ritual, acts, the, buddha, is, reported, to, have, said, by, karma, i, mean, intention, richard, gombrich, summarizes, the, buddha, s, view, of, karma, as, follows, all, thoughts, words, and, deeds, derive, their, moral, value, positive, or, negative, from, the, intention, behind, them, the, yatana, six, sense, bases, and, the, five, skandhas, aggregates, describe, how, sensory, contact, leads, to, attachment, and, dukkha, the, six, sense, bases, are, eye, and, sight, ear, and, sound, nose, and, odour, tongue, and, taste, body, and, touch, and, mind, and, thoughts, together, they, create, the, input, from, which, we, create, our, world, or, reality, the, all, this, process, takes, place, through, the, five, skandhas, aggregates, groups, heaps, five, groups, of, physical, and, mental, processes, namely, form, or, material, image, impression, rupa, sensations, or, feelings, received, from, form, vedana, perceptions, samjna, mental, activity, or, formations, sankhara, consciousness, vijnana, they, form, part, of, other, buddhist, teachings, and, lists, such, as, dependent, origination, and, explain, how, sensory, input, ultimately, leads, to, bondage, to, samsara, by, the, mental, defilements, in, the, early, texts, the, process, of, the, arising, of, dukkha, is, explicated, through, the, teaching, of, dependent, origination, which, says, that, everything, that, exists, or, occurs, is, dependent, on, conditioning, factors, the, most, basic, formulation, of, dependent, origination, is, given, in, the, early, texts, as, it, being, thus, this, comes, about, pali, evam, sati, idam, hoti, this, can, be, taken, to, mean, that, certain, phenomena, only, arise, when, there, are, other, phenomena, present, thus, their, arising, is, dependent, on, other, phenomena, the, philosopher, mark, siderits, has, outlined, the, basic, idea, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, of, dependent, origination, of, dukkha, as, follows, given, the, existence, of, a, fully, functioning, assemblage, of, psycho, physical, elements, the, parts, that, make, up, a, sentient, being, ignorance, concerning, the, three, characteristics, of, sentient, existence, suffering, impermanence, and, non, self, will, lead, in, the, course, of, normal, interactions, with, the, environment, to, appropriation, the, identification, of, certain, elements, as, i, and, mine, this, leads, in, turn, to, the, formation, of, attachments, in, the, form, of, desire, and, aversion, and, the, strengthening, of, ignorance, concerning, the, true, nature, of, sentient, existence, these, ensure, future, rebirth, and, thus, future, instances, of, old, age, disease, and, death, in, a, potentially, unending, cycle, in, numerous, early, texts, this, basic, principle, is, expanded, with, a, list, of, phenomena, that, are, said, to, be, conditionally, dependent, as, a, result, of, later, elaborations, including, vedic, cosmogenies, as, the, basis, for, the, first, four, links, according, to, boisvert, nidana, 3, 10, correlate, with, the, five, skandhas, according, to, richard, gombrich, the, twelve, fold, list, is, a, combination, of, two, previous, lists, the, second, list, beginning, with, tanha, thirst, the, cause, of, suffering, as, described, in, the, second, noble, truth, according, to, gombrich, the, two, lists, were, combined, resulting, in, contradictions, in, its, reverse, version, the, buddha, saw, his, analysis, of, dependent, origination, as, a, middle, way, between, eternalism, sassatavada, the, idea, that, some, essence, exists, eternally, and, annihilationism, ucchedavada, the, idea, that, we, go, completely, out, of, existence, at, death, in, this, view, persons, are, just, a, causal, series, of, impermanent, psycho, physical, elements, which, are, anatta, without, an, independent, or, permanent, self, the, buddha, instead, held, that, all, things, in, the, world, of, our, experience, are, transient, and, that, there, is, no, unchanging, part, to, a, person, according, to, richard, gombrich, the, buddha, s, position, is, simply, that, everything, is, process, the, buddha, s, arguments, against, an, unchanging, self, rely, on, the, scheme, of, the, five, skandhas, as, can, be, seen, in, the, pali, anattalakkha, a, sutta, and, its, parallels, in, gandhari, and, chinese, in, the, early, texts, the, buddha, teaches, that, all, five, aggregates, including, consciousness, vi, ana, which, was, held, by, brahmins, to, be, eternal, arise, due, to, dependent, origination, since, they, are, all, impermanent, one, cannot, regard, any, of, the, psycho, physical, processes, as, an, unchanging, self, even, mental, processes, such, as, consciousness, and, will, cetana, are, seen, as, being, dependently, originated, and, impermanent, and, thus, do, not, qualify, as, a, self, atman, the, buddha, saw, the, belief, in, a, self, as, arising, from, our, grasping, at, and, identifying, with, the, various, changing, phenomena, as, well, as, from, ignorance, about, how, things, really, are, furthermore, the, buddha, held, that, we, experience, suffering, because, we, hold, on, to, erroneous, self, views, as, rupert, gethin, explains, for, the, buddha, a, person, is, a, complex, flow, of, physical, and, mental, phenomena, but, peel, away, these, phenomena, and, look, behind, them, and, one, just, does, not, find, a, constant, self, that, one, can, call, one, s, own, my, sense, of, self, is, both, logically, and, emotionally, just, a, label, that, i, impose, on, these, physical, and, mental, phenomena, in, consequence, of, their, connectedness, due, to, this, view, termed, the, buddha, s, teaching, was, opposed, to, all, soul, theories, of, his, time, including, the, jain, theory, of, a, jiva, life, monad, and, the, brahmanical, theories, of, atman, pali, atta, and, purusha, all, of, these, theories, held, that, there, was, an, eternal, unchanging, essence, to, a, person, which, was, separate, from, all, changing, experiences, and, which, transmigrated, from, life, to, life, the, buddha, s, anti, essentialist, view, still, includes, an, understanding, of, continuity, through, rebirth, it, is, just, the, rebirth, of, a, process, karma, not, an, essence, like, the, atman, the, buddha, taught, a, path, marga, of, training, to, undo, the, samyojana, kleshas, and, savas, and, attain, vimutti, liberation, this, path, taught, by, the, buddha, is, depicted, in, the, early, texts, most, famously, in, the, pali, dhammacakkappavattana, sutta, and, its, numerous, parallel, texts, as, a, middle, way, between, sensual, indulgence, on, one, hand, and, mortification, of, the, body, on, the, other, a, common, presentation, of, the, core, structure, of, buddha, s, teaching, found, in, the, early, texts, is, that, of, the, four, noble, truths, which, refers, to, the, noble, eightfold, path, according, to, gethin, another, common, summary, of, the, path, to, awakening, wisely, used, in, the, early, texts, is, abandoning, the, hindrances, practice, of, the, four, establishments, of, mindfulness, and, development, of, the, awakening, factors, according, to, rupert, gethin, in, the, nikayas, and, agamas, the, buddha, s, path, is, mainly, presented, in, a, cumulative, and, gradual, step, by, step, process, such, as, that, outlined, in, the, sama, aphala, sutta, other, early, texts, like, the, upanisa, sutta, sn, 12, 23, present, the, path, as, reversions, of, the, process, of, dependent, origination, bh, van, cultivation, of, wholesome, states, is, central, to, the, buddha, s, path, common, practices, to, this, goal, which, are, shared, by, most, of, these, early, presentations, of, the, path, include, sila, ethical, training, restraint, of, the, senses, indriyasamvara, sati, mindfulness, and, sampaja, a, clear, awareness, and, the, practice, of, dhyana, the, cumulative, development, of, wholesome, states, leading, to, a, state, of, perfect, equanimity, and, awareness, upekkh, sati, parisuddhi, dhyana, is, preceded, and, supported, by, various, aspects, of, the, path, such, as, sense, restraint, and, mindfulness, which, is, elaborated, in, the, satipatthana, scheme, as, taught, in, the, pali, satipatthana, sutta, and, the, sixteen, elements, of, anapanasati, as, taught, in, the, anapanasati, sutta, in, various, texts, the, buddha, is, depicted, as, having, studied, under, two, named, teachers, ra, k, l, ma, and, uddaka, r, maputta, according, to, alexander, wynne, these, were, yogis, who, taught, doctrines, and, practices, similar, to, those, in, the, upanishads, according, to, johannes, bronkhorst, the, meditation, without, breath, and, reduced, intake, of, food, which, the, buddha, practiced, before, his, awakening, are, forms, of, asceticism, which, are, similar, to, jain, practices, according, to, richard, gombrich, the, buddha, s, teachings, on, karma, and, rebirth, are, a, development, of, pre, buddhist, themes, that, can, be, found, in, jain, and, brahmanical, sources, like, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, likewise, samsara, the, idea, that, we, are, trapped, in, cycles, of, rebirth, and, that, we, should, seek, liberation, from, them, through, non, harming, ahimsa, and, spiritual, practices, pre, dates, the, buddha, and, was, likely, taught, in, early, jainism, according, to, k, r, norman, the, buddhist, teaching, of, the, three, marks, of, existence, may, also, reflect, upanishadic, or, other, influences, the, buddhist, practice, called, brahma, vihara, may, have, also, originated, from, a, brahmanic, term, but, its, usage, may, have, been, common, in, the, sramana, traditions, one, method, to, obtain, information, on, the, oldest, core, of, buddhism, is, to, compare, the, oldest, versions, of, the, pali, canon, and, other, texts, such, as, the, surviving, portions, of, sarvastivada, mulasarvastivada, mahisasaka, dharmaguptaka, and, the, chinese, agamas, the, reliability, of, these, sources, and, the, possibility, of, drawing, out, a, core, of, oldest, teachings, is, a, matter, of, dispute, according, to, lambert, schmithausen, there, are, three, positions, held, by, modern, scholars, of, buddhism, with, regard, to, the, authenticity, of, the, teachings, contained, in, the, nikayas, scholars, such, as, richard, gombrich, akira, hirakawa, alexander, wynne, and, a, k, warder, hold, that, these, early, buddhist, texts, contain, material, that, could, possibly, be, traced, to, the, buddha, richard, gombrich, argues, that, since, the, content, of, the, earliest, texts, presents, such, originality, intelligence, grandeur, and, most, relevantly, coherence, it, is, hard, to, see, it, as, a, composite, work, thus, he, concludes, they, are, the, work, of, one, genius, peter, harvey, also, agrees, that, much, of, the, pali, canon, must, derive, from, his, teachings, likewise, a, k, warder, has, written, that, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, it, was, formulated, by, anyone, other, than, the, buddha, and, his, immediate, followers, according, to, alexander, wynne, the, internal, evidence, of, the, early, buddhist, literature, proves, its, historical, authenticity, other, scholars, of, buddhist, studies, have, disagreed, with, the, mostly, positive, view, that, the, early, buddhist, texts, reflect, the, teachings, of, the, historical, buddha, arguing, that, some, teachings, contained, in, the, early, texts, are, the, authentic, teachings, of, the, buddha, but, not, others, according, to, tilmann, vetter, inconsistencies, remain, and, other, methods, must, be, applied, to, resolve, those, inconsistencies, according, to, tilmann, vetter, the, earliest, core, of, the, buddhist, teachings, is, the, meditative, practice, of, dhy, na, but, liberating, insight, became, an, essential, feature, of, the, buddhist, tradition, only, at, a, later, date, he, posits, that, the, fourth, noble, truths, the, eightfold, path, and, dependent, origination, which, are, commonly, seen, as, essential, to, buddhism, are, later, formulations, which, form, part, of, the, explanatory, framework, of, this, liberating, insight, lambert, schmithausen, similarly, argues, that, the, mention, of, the, four, noble, truths, as, constituting, liberating, insight, which, is, attained, after, mastering, the, four, dhy, nas, is, a, later, addition, johannes, bronkhorst, also, argues, that, the, four, truths, may, not, have, been, formulated, in, earliest, buddhism, and, did, not, serve, in, earliest, buddhism, as, a, description, of, liberating, insight, edward, conze, argued, that, the, attempts, of, european, scholars, to, reconstruct, the, original, teachings, of, the, buddha, were, all, mere, guesswork, the, early, buddhist, texts, depict, the, buddha, as, promoting, the, life, of, a, homeless, and, celibate, sramana, or, mendicant, as, the, ideal, way, of, life, for, the, practice, of, the, path, he, taught, that, mendicants, or, beggars, bhikkhus, were, supposed, to, give, up, all, possessions, and, to, own, just, a, begging, bowl, and, three, robes, as, part, of, the, buddha, s, monastic, discipline, they, were, also, supposed, to, rely, on, the, wider, lay, community, for, the, basic, necessities, mainly, food, clothing, and, lodging, the, buddha, s, teachings, on, monastic, discipline, were, preserved, in, the, various, vinaya, collections, of, the, different, early, schools, buddhist, monastics, which, included, both, monks, and, nuns, were, supposed, to, beg, for, their, food, were, not, allowed, to, store, up, food, or, eat, after, noon, and, they, were, not, allowed, to, use, gold, silver, or, any, valuables, according, to, bronkhorst, the, bearers, of, tradition, the, brahmins, did, not, occupy, a, dominant, position, in, the, area, in, which, the, buddha, preached, his, message, nevertheless, the, buddha, was, acquainted, with, brahmanism, and, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, the, buddha, references, brahmanical, devices, for, example, in, samyutta, nikaya, 111, majjhima, nikaya, 92, and, vinaya, i, 246, of, the, pali, canon, the, buddha, praises, the, agnihotra, as, the, foremost, sacrifice, and, the, gayatri, mantra, as, the, foremost, meter, in, general, the, buddha, critiques, the, brahmanical, religion, and, social, system, on, certain, key, points, the, brahmin, caste, held, that, the, vedas, were, eternal, revealed, sruti, texts, the, buddha, on, the, other, hand, did, not, accept, that, these, texts, had, any, divine, authority, or, value, the, buddha, also, did, not, see, the, brahmanical, rites, and, practices, as, useful, for, spiritual, advancement, for, example, in, the, ud, na, the, buddha, points, out, that, ritual, bathing, does, not, lead, to, purity, only, truth, and, morality, lead, to, purity, he, especially, critiqued, animal, sacrifice, as, taught, in, vedas, the, buddha, contrasted, his, teachings, which, were, taught, openly, to, all, people, with, that, of, the, brahmins, who, kept, their, mantras, secret, the, buddha, also, critiqued, the, brahmins, claims, of, superior, birth, and, the, idea, that, different, castes, and, bloodlines, were, inherently, pure, or, impure, noble, or, ignoble, in, the, vasettha, sutta, the, buddha, argues, that, the, main, difference, among, humans, is, not, birth, but, their, actions, and, occupations, according, to, the, buddha, one, is, a, brahmin, i, e, divine, like, brahma, only, to, the, extent, that, one, has, cultivated, virtue, because, of, this, the, early, texts, report, that, he, proclaimed, not, by, birth, one, is, a, brahman, not, by, birth, one, is, a, non, brahman, by, moral, action, one, is, a, brahman, the, agga, a, sutta, explains, all, classes, or, varnas, can, be, good, or, bad, and, gives, a, sociological, explanation, for, how, they, arose, against, the, brahmanical, idea, that, they, are, divinely, ordained, according, to, kancha, ilaiah, the, buddha, posed, the, first, contract, theory, of, society, the, buddha, s, teaching, then, is, a, single, universal, moral, law, one, dharma, valid, for, everybody, which, is, opposed, to, the, brahmanic, ethic, founded, on, one, s, own, duty, svadharma, which, depends, on, caste, because, of, this, all, castes, including, untouchables, were, welcome, in, the, buddhist, order, and, when, someone, joined, they, renounced, all, caste, affiliation, the, early, texts, depict, the, buddha, as, giving, a, deflationary, account, of, the, importance, of, politics, to, human, life, politics, is, inevitable, and, is, probably, even, necessary, and, helpful, but, it, is, also, a, tremendous, waste, of, time, and, effort, as, well, as, being, a, prime, temptation, to, allow, ego, to, run, rampant, buddhist, political, theory, denies, that, people, have, a, moral, duty, to, engage, in, politics, except, to, a, very, minimal, degree, pay, the, taxes, obey, the, laws, maybe, vote, in, the, elections, and, it, actively, portrays, engagement, in, politics, and, the, pursuit, of, enlightenment, as, being, conflicting, paths, in, life, in, the, agga, a, sutta, the, buddha, teaches, a, history, of, how, monarchy, arose, which, according, to, matthew, j, moore, is, closely, analogous, to, a, social, contract, the, agga, a, sutta, also, provides, a, social, explanation, of, how, different, classes, arose, in, contrast, to, the, vedic, views, on, social, caste, other, early, texts, like, the, cakkavatti, s, han, da, sutta, and, the, mah, sudassana, sutta, focus, on, the, figure, of, the, righteous, wheel, turning, leader, cakkavatti, this, ideal, leader, is, one, who, promotes, dharma, through, his, governance, he, can, only, achieve, his, status, through, moral, purity, and, must, promote, morality, and, dharma, to, maintain, his, position, according, to, the, cakkavatti, s, han, da, sutta, the, key, duties, of, a, cakkavatti, are, establish, guard, ward, and, protection, according, to, dhamma, for, your, own, household, your, troops, your, nobles, and, vassals, for, brahmins, and, householders, town, and, country, folk, ascetics, and, brahmins, for, beasts, and, birds, let, no, crime, prevail, in, your, kingdom, and, to, those, who, are, in, need, give, property, the, sutta, explains, the, injunction, to, give, to, the, needy, by, telling, how, a, line, of, wheel, turning, monarchs, falls, because, they, fail, to, give, to, the, needy, and, thus, the, kingdom, falls, into, infighting, as, poverty, increases, which, then, leads, to, stealing, and, violence, in, the, mah, parinibb, na, sutta, the, buddha, outlines, several, principles, that, he, promoted, among, the, vajjika, tribal, federation, which, had, a, quasi, republican, form, of, government, he, taught, them, to, hold, regular, and, frequent, assemblies, live, in, harmony, and, maintain, their, traditions, the, buddha, then, goes, on, to, promote, a, similar, kind, of, republican, style, of, government, among, the, buddhist, sangha, where, all, monks, had, equal, rights, to, attend, open, meetings, and, there, would, be, no, single, leader, since, the, buddha, also, chose, not, to, appoint, one, some, scholars, have, argued, that, this, fact, signals, that, the, buddha, preferred, a, republican, form, of, government, while, others, disagree, with, this, position, as, noted, by, bhikkhu, bodhi, the, buddha, as, depicted, in, the, pali, suttas, does, not, exclusively, teach, a, world, transcending, goal, but, also, teaches, laypersons, how, to, achieve, worldly, happiness, sukha, according, to, bodhi, the, most, comprehensive, of, the, suttas, that, focus, on, how, to, live, as, a, layperson, is, the, sig, lov, da, sutta, dn, 31, this, sutta, outlines, how, a, layperson, behaves, towards, six, basic, social, relationships, parents, and, children, teacher, and, pupils, husband, and, wife, friend, and, friend, employer, and, workers, lay, follower, and, religious, guides, this, pali, text, also, has, parallels, in, chinese, and, in, sanskrit, fragments, in, another, sutta, d, ghaj, u, sutta, an, 8, 54, the, buddha, teaches, two, types, of, happiness, first, there, is, the, happiness, visible, in, this, very, life, the, buddha, states, that, four, things, lead, to, this, happiness, the, accomplishment, of, persistent, effort, the, accomplishment, of, protection, good, friendship, and, balanced, living, similarly, in, several, other, suttas, the, buddha, teaches, on, how, to, improve, family, relationships, particularly, on, the, importance, of, filial, love, and, gratitude, as, well, as, marital, well, being, regarding, the, happiness, of, the, next, life, the, buddha, in, the, d, ghaj, u, sutta, states, that, the, virtues, which, lead, to, a, good, rebirth, are, faith, in, the, buddha, and, the, teachings, moral, discipline, especially, keeping, the, five, precepts, generosity, and, wisdom, knowledge, of, the, arising, and, passing, of, things, according, to, the, buddha, of, the, suttas, then, achieving, a, good, rebirth, is, based, on, cultivating, wholesome, or, skillful, kusala, karma, which, leads, to, a, good, result, and, avoiding, unwholesome, akusala, karma, a, common, list, of, good, karmas, taught, by, the, buddha, is, the, list, of, ten, courses, of, action, kammapatha, as, outlined, in, mn, 41, saleyyaka, sutta, and, its, chinese, parallel, in, s, 1042, good, karma, is, also, termed, merit, pu, a, and, the, buddha, outlines, three, bases, of, meritorious, actions, giving, moral, discipline, and, meditation, as, seen, in, an, 8, 36, early, sources, depict, the, buddha, s, as, similar, to, other, buddhist, monks, various, discourses, describe, how, he, cut, off, his, hair, and, beard, when, renouncing, the, world, likewise, digha, nikaya, 3, has, a, brahmin, describe, the, buddha, as, a, shaved, or, bald, mundaka, man, digha, nikaya, 2, also, describes, how, king, ajatashatru, is, unable, to, tell, which, of, the, monks, is, the, buddha, when, approaching, the, sangha, and, must, ask, his, minister, to, point, him, out, likewise, in, mn, 140, a, mendicant, who, sees, himself, as, a, follower, of, the, buddha, meets, the, buddha, in, person, but, is, unable, to, recognize, him, the, buddha, is, also, described, as, being, handsome, and, with, a, clear, complexion, digha, i, 115, anguttara, i, 181, at, least, in, his, youth, in, old, age, however, he, is, described, as, having, a, stooped, body, with, slack, and, wrinkled, limbs, various, buddhist, texts, attribute, to, the, buddha, a, series, of, extraordinary, physical, characteristics, known, as, the, 32, signs, of, the, great, man, skt, mah, puru, a, lak, a, a, according, to, an, layo, when, they, first, appear, in, the, buddhist, texts, these, physical, marks, were, initially, held, to, be, imperceptible, to, the, ordinary, person, and, required, special, training, to, detect, later, though, they, are, depicted, as, being, visible, by, regular, people, and, as, inspiring, faith, in, the, buddha, these, characteristics, are, described, in, the, digha, nikaya, s, lakkha, a, sutta, d, i, 142, this, hindu, synthesis, emerged, after, the, lifetime, of, the, buddha, between, 500, 200, bce, and, c, 300, ce, under, the, pressure, of, the, success, of, buddhism, and, jainism, in, response, to, the, success, of, buddhism, gautama, also, came, to, be, regarded, as, the, 9th, avatar, of, vishnu, many, hindus, claim, that, buddha, was, hindu, and, cite, a, belief, that, the, buddha, is, the, ninth, avatar, of, vishnu, in, support, the, adoption, of, the, buddha, as, an, incarnation, began, at, approximately, the, same, time, as, hinduism, began, to, predominate, and, buddhism, to, decline, in, india, the, co, option, into, a, list, of, avatars, seen, to, be, an, aspect, of, hindu, efforts, to, decisively, weaken, buddhist, power, and, appeal, in, india, however, buddha, s, teachings, deny, the, authority, of, the, vedas, and, the, concepts, of, brahman, atman, consequently, buddhism, is, generally, classified, as, a, n, stika, school, heterodox, literally, it, is, not, so, in, contrast, to, the, six, orthodox, schools, of, hinduism,

regarding, the, exact, identity, of, buddha, were, diverse, accordingly, some, regarded, him, as, the, divine, incarnate, others, as, an, apostle, of, the, angels, or, as, an, ifrit, and, others, as,
