is, considered, a, british, national, heroine, and, a, symbol, of, the, struggle, for, justice, and, independence, boudica, s, husband, prasutagus, with, whom, she, had, two, daughters, ruled, as, a, nominally, independent, ally, of, rome, he, left, his, kingdom, jointly, to, his, daughters, and, to, the, roman, emperor, in, his, will, when, he, died, his, will, was, ignored, and, the, kingdom, was, annexed, and, his, property, taken, according, to, the, roman, historian, tacitus, boudica, was, flogged, and, her, daughters, raped, the, historian, cassius, dio, wrote, that, previous, imperial, donations, to, influential, britons, were, confiscated, and, the, roman, financier, and, philosopher, seneca, called, in, the, loans, he, had, forced, on, the, reluctant, britons, in, 60, 61, boudica, led, the, iceni, and, other, british, tribes, in, revolt, they, destroyed, camulodunum, modern, colchester, earlier, the, capital, of, the, trinovantes, but, at, that, time, a, colonia, for, discharged, roman, soldiers, upon, hearing, of, the, revolt, the, roman, governor, gaius, suetonius, paulinus, hurried, from, the, island, of, mona, modern, anglesey, to, londinium, the, 20, year, old, commercial, settlement, that, was, the, rebels, next, target, unable, to, defend, the, settlement, he, evacuated, and, abandoned, it, boudica, s, army, defeated, a, detachment, of, the,

regrouped, his, forces, possibly, in, the, west, midlands, and, despite, being, heavily, outnumbered, he, decisively, defeated, the, britons, boudica, died, by, suicide, or, illness, shortly, afterwards, the, crisis, of, 60, 61, caused, nero, to, consider, withdrawing, all, his, imperial, forces, from, britain, but, suetonius, s, victory, over, boudica, confirmed, roman, control, of, the, province, interest, in, these, events, was, revived, in, the, english, renaissance, and, led, to, boudica, s, fame, in, the, victorian, era, and, as, a, cultural, symbol, in, britain, the, boudican, revolt, against, the, roman, empire, is, referred, to, in, four, works, from, classical, antiquity, written, by, three, roman, historians, the, agricola, c, 98, and, annals, c, 110s, by, tacitus, a, mention, of, the, uprising, by, suetonius, in, his, lives, of, the, caesars, 121, and, the, longest, account, a, detailed, description, of, the, revolt, contained, within, cassius, dio, s, history, of, the, empire, c, 202, c, 235, tacitus, wrote, some, years, after, the, rebellion, but, his, father, in, law, gnaeus, julius, agricola, was, an, eyewitness, to, the, events, having, served, in, britain, as, a, tribune, under, suetonius, paulinus, during, this, period, cassius, dio, began, his, history, of, rome, and, its, empire, about, 140, years, after, boudica, s, death, much, is, lost, and, his, account, of, boudica, survives, only, in, the, epitome, of, an, 11th, century, byzantine, monk, john, xiphilinus, he, provides, greater, and, more, lurid, detail, than, tacitus, but, in, general, his, details, are, often, fictitious, both, tacitus, and, dio, give, an, account, of, battle, speeches, given, by, boudica, though, it, is, thought, that, her, words, were, never, recorded, during, her, life, although, imaginary, these, speeches, designed, to, provide, a, comparison, for, readers, of, the, antagonists, demands, and, approaches, to, war, and, to, portray, the, romans, as, morally, superior, to, their, enemy, helped, create, an, image, of, patriotism, that, turned, boudica, into, a, legendary, figure, boudica, was, the, consort, of, prasutagus, king, of, the, iceni, a, tribe, who, inhabited, what, is, now, the, english, county, of, norfolk, and, parts, of, the, neighbouring, counties, of, cambridgeshire, suffolk, and, lincolnshire, the, iceni, produced, some, of, the, earliest, known, british, coins, they, had, revolted, against, the, romans, in, 47, when, the, roman, governor, publius, ostorius, scapula, planned, to, disarm, all, the, peoples, of, britain, under, roman, control, the, romans, allowed, the, kingdom, to, retain, its, independence, once, the, uprising, was, suppressed, on, his, death, in, ad, 60, 61, prasutagus, made, his, two, daughters, as, well, as, the, roman, emperor, nero, his, heirs, the, romans, ignored, the, will, and, the, kingdom, was, absorbed, into, the, province, of, britannia, catus, decianus, procurator, of, britain, was, sent, to, secure, the, iceni, kingdom, for, rome, have, we, not, been, robbed, entirely, of, most, of, our, possessions, and, those, the, greatest, while, for, those, that, remain, we, pay, taxes, besides, pasturing, and, tilling, for, them, all, our, other, possessions, do, we, not, pay, a, yearly, tribute, for, our, very, bodies, how, much, better, it, would, be, to, have, been, sold, to, masters, once, for, all, than, possessing, empty, titles, of, freedom, to, have, to, ransom, ourselves, every, year, how, much, better, to, have, been, slain, and, to, have, perished, than, to, go, about, with, a, tax, on, our, heads, among, the, rest, of, mankind, death, frees, even, those, who, are, in, slavery, to, others, only, in, the, case, of, the, romans, do, the, very, dead, remain, alive, for, their, profit, why, is, it, that, though, none, of, us, has, any, money, how, indeed, could, we, or, where, would, we, get, it, we, are, stripped, and, despoiled, like, a, murderer, s, victims, and, why, should, the, romans, be, expected, to, display, moderation, as, time, goes, on, when, they, have, behaved, toward, us, in, this, fashion, at, the, very, outset, when, all, men, show, consideration, even, for, the, beasts, they, have, newly, captured, part, of, a, speech, cassius, dio, gives, boudica, the, romans, next, actions, were, described, by, tacitus, who, detailed, pillaging, of, the, countryside, the, ransacking, of, the, king, s, household, and, the, brutal, treatment, of, boudica, and, her, daughters, according, to, tacitus, boudica, was, flogged, and, her, daughters, were, raped, these, abuses, are, not, mentioned, in, dio, s, account, who, instead, cites, three, different, causes, for, the, rebellion, the, recalling, of, loans, that, were, given, to, the, britons, by, seneca, decianus, catus, s, confiscation, of, money, formerly, loaned, to, the, britons, by, the, emperor, claudius, and, boudica, s, own, entreaties, the, loans, were, thought, by, the, iceni, to, have, been, repaid, by, gift, exchange, dio, gives, boudica, a, speech, to, her, people, and, their, allies, reminding, them, that, life, was, much, better, before, the, roman, occupation, stressing, that, wealth, cannot, be, enjoyed, under, slavery, and, placing, the, blame, upon, herself, for, not, expelling, the, romans, as, they, had, done, when, julius, caesar, invaded, the, willingness, of, those, seen, as, barbarians, to, sacrifice, a, higher, quality, of, living, under, the, romans, in, exchange, for, their, freedom, and, personal, liberty, was, an, important, part, of, what, dio, considered, to, be, motivation, for, the, rebellions, the, first, target, of, the, rebels, was, camulodunum, modern, colchester, a, roman, colonia, for, retired, soldiers, a, roman, temple, had, been, erected, there, to, claudius, at, great, expense, to, the, local, population, combined, with, brutal, treatment, of, the, britons, by, the, veterans, this, had, caused, resentment, towards, the, romans, the, iceni, and, the, trinovantes, comprised, an, army, of, 120, 000, men, dio, claimed, that, boudica, called, upon, the, british, goddess, of, victory, andraste, to, aid, her, army, once, the, revolt, had, begun, the, only, roman, troops, available, to, provide, assistance, aside, from, the, few, within, the, colony, were, 200, auxiliaries, located, in, london, who, were, not, equipped, to, fight, boudica, s, army, camulodunum, was, captured, by, the, rebels, those, inhabitants, who, survived, the, initial, attack, took, refuge, in, the, temple, of, claudius, for, two, days, before, they, were, killed, quintus, petillius, cerialis, then, commanding, the, legio, ix, hispana, attempted, to, relieve, camulodunum, but, suffered, an, overwhelming, defeat, the, infantry, with, him, were, all, killed, and, only, the, commander, and, some, of, his, cavalry, escaped, after, this, disaster, catus, decianus, whose, behaviour, had, provoked, the, rebellion, fled, abroad, to, gaul, suetonius, was, leading, a, campaign, against, the, island, of, mona, off, the, coast, of, north, wales, on, hearing, the, news, of, the, iceni, uprising, he, left, a, garrison, on, mona, and, returned, to, deal, with, boudica, he, moved, quickly, with, a, force, of, men, through, hostile, territory, to, londinium, which, he, reached, before, the, arrival, of, boudica, s, army, but, outnumbered, he, decided, to, abandon, the, town, to, the, rebels, who, burned, it, down, after, torturing, and, killing, everyone, who, had, remained, the, rebels, also, sacked, the, municipium, of, verulamium, modern, st, albans, north, west, of, london, though, the, extent, of, its, destruction, is, unclear, dio, and, tacitus, both, reported, that, around, 80, 000, people, were, said, to, have, been, killed, by, the, rebels, according, to, tacitus, the, britons, had, no, interest, in, taking, the, roman, population, as, prisoners, only, in, slaughter, by, gibbet, fire, or, cross, dio, adds, that, the, noblest, women, were, impaled, on, spikes, and, had, their, breasts, cut, off, and, sewn, to, their, mouths, to, the, accompaniment, of, sacrifices, banquets, and, wanton, behaviour, in, sacred, places, particularly, the, groves, of, andraste, suetonius, regrouped, his, forces, he, amassed, an, army, of, almost, 10, 000, men, at, an, unidentified, location, and, took, a, stand, in, a, defile, with, a, wood, behind, the, romans, used, the, terrain, to, their, advantage, launching, javelins, at, the, britons, before, advancing, in, a, wedge, shaped, formation, and, deploying, cavalry, the, roman, army, was, heavily, outnumbered, according, to, dio, the, rebels, numbered, 230, 000, but, boudica, s, army, was, crushed, and, according, to, tacitus, neither, the, women, nor, the, animals, were, spared, tacitus, states, that, boudica, poisoned, herself, dio, says, she, fell, sick, and, died, after, which, she, was, given, a, lavish, burial, it, has, been, argued, that, these, accounts, are, not, mutually, exclusive, boudica, may, have, been, an, honorific, title, in, which, case, the, name, by, which, she, was, known, during, most, of, her, life, is, unknown, the, english, linguist, and, translator, kenneth, jackson, concluded, that, the, name, boudica, based, on, later, developments, in, welsh, buddug, and, irish, buaidheach, derives, from, the, proto, celtic, feminine, adjective, boud, k, victorious, which, in, turn, is, derived, from, the, celtic, word, boud, victory, and, that, the, correct, spelling, of, the, name, in, common, brittonic, the, british, celtic, language, is, boudica, pronounced, variations, on, the, historically, correct, boudica, include, boudicca, bonduca, boadicea, and, buduica, the, gaulish, version, of, her, name, is, attested, in, inscriptions, as, boudiga, in, bordeaux, boudica, in, lusitania, and, bodicca, in, algeria, boudica, s, name, was, spelt, incorrectly, by, dio, who, used, buduica, her, name, was, also, misspelled, by, tacitus, who, added, a, second, c, after, the, misspelling, was, copied, by, a, medieval, scribe, further, variations, began, to, appear, along, with, the, second, c, becoming, an, e, an, a, appeared, in, place, of, the, u, which, produced, the, medieval, and, most, common, version, of, the, name, boadicea, the, true, spelling, was, totally, obscured, when, boadicea, first, appeared, in, around, the, 17th, century, william, cowper, used, this, spelling, in, his, poem, boadicea, an, ode, 1782, a, work, whose, impact, resulted, in, boudica, s, reinvention, as, a, british, imperialistic, champion, one, of, the, earliest, possible, mentions, of, boudica, excluding, tacitus, and, dio, s, accounts, was, the, 6th, century, work, de, excidio, et, conquestu, britanniae, by, the, british, monk, gildas, in, it, he, demonstrates, his, knowledge, of, a, female, leader, whom, he, describes, as, a, treacherous, lioness, who, butchered, the, governors, who, had, been, left, to, give, fuller, voice, and, strength, to, the, endeavours, of, roman, rule, both, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, 731, and, the, 9th, century, work, historia, brittonum, by, the, welsh, monk, nennius, include, references, to, the, uprising, of, 60, 61, but, do, not, mention, boudica, no, contemporary, description, of, boudica, exists, dio, writing, more, than, a, century, after, her, death, provided, a, detailed, description, of, the, iceni, queen, translated, in, 1925, in, stature, she, was, very, tall, in, appearance, most, terrifying, in, the, glance, of, her, eye, most, fierce, and, her, voice, was, harsh, a, great, mass, of, the, tawniest, hair, fell, to, her, hips, around, her, neck, was, a, large, golden, necklace, and, she, wore, a, tunic, of, divers, colours, over, which, a, thick, mantle, was, fastened, with, a, brooch, this, was, her, invariable, attire, during, the, renaissance, the, works, of, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, became, available, in, england, after, which, her, status, changed, as, it, was, interpreted, by, historians, poets, and, dramatists, boudica, appeared, as, voadicia, in, a, history, anglica, historia, by, the, italian, scholar, polydore, vergil, and, in, the, scottish, historian, hector, boece, s, the, history, and, chronicles, of, scotland, 1526, she, is, voada, the, first, appearance, of, boudica, in, a, british, publication, boudica, was, called, voadicia, in, the, english, historian, raphael, holinshed, s, chronicles, published, between, 1577, and, 1587, a, narrative, by, the, florentine, scholar, petruccio, ubaldini, in, the, lives, of, the, noble, ladies, of, the, kingdom, of, england, and, scotland, 1591, includes, two, female, characters, voadicia, and, bunduica, both, based, on, boudica, from, the, 1570s, to, the, 1590s, when, elizabeth, i, s, england, was, at, war, with, spain, boudica, proved, to, be, a, valuable, asset, for, the, english, the, english, poet, edmund, spenser, used, the, story, of, boudica, in, his, poem, the, ruines, of, time, involving, a, story, about, a, british, heroine, he, called, bunduca, a, variation, of, this, name, was, used, in, the, jacobean, play, bonduca, 1612, a, tragicomedy, that, most, scholars, agree, was, written, by, john, fletcher, in, which, one, of, the, characters, was, boudica, a, version, of, that, play, called, bonduca, or, the, british, heroine, was, set, to, music, by, the, english, composer, henry, purcell, in, 1695, one, of, the, choruses, britons, strike, home, became, a, popular, patriotic, song, in, britain, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, during, the, late, 18th, century, boudica, was, used, to, develop, ideas, of, english, nationhood, illustrations, of, boudica, during, this, period, such, as, in, edward, barnard, s, new, complete, and, authentic, history, of, england, 1790, and, the, drawing, by, thomas, stothard, of, the, queen, as, a, classical,

notable, literary, work, to, champion, the, resistance, of, the, britons, and, helped, to, project, british, ideas, of, imperial, expansion, it, caused, boudica, to, become, a, british, cultural, icon, and, be, perceived, as, a, national, heroine, alfred, lord, tennyson, s, poem, bo, dic, a, written, in, 1859, and, published, in, 1864, drew, on, cowper, s, poem, depicting, the, iceni, queen,
