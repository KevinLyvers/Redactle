at, a, local, inn, during, the, circuit, in, 1804, he, ended, his, use, of, the, lasswade, cottage, and, leased, the, substantial, house, of, ashestiel, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, from, selkirk, sited, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, tweed, and, incorporating, an, ancient, tower, house, at, scott, s, insistence, the, first, edition, of, minstrelsy, was, printed, by, his, friend, james, ballantyne,

transition, in, 1802, in, 1805, they, became, partners, in, the, printing, business, and, from, then, until, the, financial, crash, of, 1826, scott, s, works, were, routinely, printed, by, the, firm, scott, was, known, for, his, fondness, of, dogs, and, owned, several, throughout, his, life, upon, his, death, one, newspaper, noted, of, all, the, great, men, who, have, loved, dogs, no, one, ever, loved, them, better, or, understood, them, more, thoroughly, the, best, known, of, scott, s, dogs, were, maida, a, large, stag, hound, and, spice, a, dandie, dinmont, terrier, described, as, having, asthma, to, which, scott, gave, particular, care, in, a, diary, entry, written, at, the, height, of, his, financial, woes, scott, described, dismay, at, the, prospect, of, having, to, sell, them, the, thoughts, of, parting, from, these, dumb, creatures, have, moved, me, more, than, any, of, the, reflections, i, have, put, down, between, 1805, and, 1817, scott, produced, five, long, six, canto, narrative, poems, four, shorter, independently, published, poems, and, many, small, metrical, pieces, scott, was, by, far, the, most, popular, poet, of, the, time, until, lord, byron, published, the, first, two, cantos, of, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, in, 1812, and, followed, them, up, with, his, exotic, oriental, verse, narratives, the, lay, of, the, last, minstrel, 1805, in, medieval, romance, form, grew, out, of, scott, s, plan, to, include, a, long, original, poem, of, his, own, in, the, second, edition, of, the, minstrelsy, it, was, to, be, a, sort, of, romance, of, border, chivalry, inchantment, he, owed, the, distinctive, irregular, accent, in, four, beat, metre, to, coleridge, s, christabel, which, he, had, heard, recited, by, john, stoddart, it, was, not, to, be, published, until, 1816, scott, was, able, to, draw, on, his, unrivalled, familiarity, with, border, history, and, legend, acquired, from, oral, and, written, sources, beginning, in, his, childhood, to, present, an, energetic, and, highly, coloured, picture, of, 16th, century, scotland, which, both, captivated, the, general, public, and, with, its, voluminous, notes, also, addressed, itself, to, the, antiquarian, student, the, poem, has, a, strong, moral, theme, as, human, pride, is, placed, in, the, context, of, the, last, judgment, with, the, introduction, of, a, version, of, the, dies, irae, at, the, end, the, work, was, an, immediate, success, with, almost, all, the, reviewers, and, with, readers, in, general, going, through, five, editions, in, one, year, the, most, celebrated, lines, are, the, ones, that, open, the, final, stanza, breathes, there, the, man, with, soul, so, dead, who, never, to, himself, hath, said, this, is, my, own, my, native, land, whose, heart, hath, ne, er, within, him, burned, as, home, his, footsteps, he, hath, turned, from, wandering, on, a, foreign, strand, if, such, there, breathe, go, mark, him, well, for, him, no, minstrel, raptures, swell, three, years, after, the, lay, scott, published, marmion, 1808, telling, a, story, of, corrupt, passions, leading, up, as, a, disastrous, climax, to, the, battle, of, flodden, in, 1513, the, main, innovation, involves, prefacing, each, of, the, six, cantos, with, an, epistle, from, the, author, to, a, friend, william, stewart, rose, the, rev, john, marriot, william, erskine, james, skene, george, ellis, and, richard, heber, the, epistles, develop, themes, of, moral, positives, and, special, delights, imparted, by, art, in, an, unprecedented, move, the, publisher, archibald, constable, purchased, the, copyright, of, the, poem, for, a, thousand, guineas, at, the, beginning, of, 1807, when, only, the, first, had, been, completed, constable, s, faith, was, justified, by, the, sales, the, three, editions, published, in, 1808, sold, 8, 000, copies, the, verse, of, marmion, is, less, striking, than, that, of, the, lay, with, the, epistles, in, iambic, tetrameters, and, the, narrative, in, tetrameters, with, frequent, trimeters, the, reception, by, the, reviewers, was, less, favourable, than, that, accorded, the, lay, style, and, plot, were, both, found, faulty, the, epistles, did, not, link, up, with, the, narrative, there, was, too, much, antiquarian, pedantry, and, marmion, s, character, was, immoral, the, most, familiar, lines, in, the, poem, sum, up, one, of, its, main, themes, o, what, a, tangled, web, we, weave, when, first, we, practice, to, deceive, scott, s, meteoric, poetic, career, peaked, with, his, third, long, narrative, the, lady, of, the, lake, 1810, which, sold, 20, 000, copies, in, the, first, year, the, reviewers, were, fairly, favourable, finding, the, defects, noted, in, marmion, largely, absent, in, some, ways, it, is, more, conventional, than, its, predecessors, the, narrative, is, entirely, in, iambic, tetrameters, and, the, story, of, the, transparently, disguised, james, v, king, of, scots, 1513, 42, predictable, coleridge, wrote, to, wordsworth, the, movement, of, the, poem, is, between, a, sleeping, canter, and, a, marketwoman, s, trot, but, it, is, endless, i, seem, never, to, have, made, any, way, i, never, remember, a, narrative, poem, in, which, i, felt, the, sense, of, progress, so, languid, but, the, metrical, uniformity, is, relieved, by, frequent, songs, and, the, perthshire, highland, setting, is, presented, as, an, enchanted, landscape, which, caused, a, phenomenal, increase, in, the, local, tourist, trade, moreover, the, poem, touches, on, a, theme, that, was, to, be, central, to, the, waverley, novels, the, clash, between, neighbouring, societies, in, different, stages, of, development, the, remaining, two, long, narrative, poems, rokeby, 1813, set, in, the, yorkshire, estate, of, that, name, belonging, to, scott, s, friend, j, b, s, morritt, during, the, civil, war, period, and, the, lord, of, the, isles, 1815, set, in, early, 14th, century, scotland, and, culminating, in, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, 1314, both, works, had, generally, favourable, receptions, and, sold, well, but, without, rivalling, the, huge, success, of, the, lady, of, the, lake, scott, also, produced, four, minor, narrative, or, semi, narrative, poems, between, 1811, and, 1817, the, vision, of, don, roderick, 1811, celebrating, wellington, s, successes, in, the, peninsular, campaign, with, profits, donated, to, portuguese, war, sufferers, the, bridal, of, triermain, published, anonymously, in, 1813, the, field, of, waterloo, 1815, and, harold, the, dauntless, published, anonymously, in, 1817, throughout, his, creative, life, scott, was, an, active, reviewer, although, himself, a, tory, he, reviewed, for, the, edinburgh, review, between, 1803, and, 1806, but, that, journal, s, advocacy, of, peace, with, napoleon, led, him, to, cancel, his, subscription, in, 1808, the, following, year, at, the, height, of, his, poetic, career, he, was, instrumental, in, establishing, a, tory, rival, the, quarterly, review, to, which, he, contributed, reviews, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1813, scott, was, offered, the, position, of, poet, laureate, he, declined, feeling, that, such, an, appointment, would, be, a, poisoned, chalice, as, the, laureateship, had, fallen, into, disrepute, due, to, the, decline, in, quality, of, work, suffered, by, previous, title, holders, as, a, succession, of, poetasters, had, churned, out, conventional, and, obsequious, odes, on, royal, occasions, he, sought, advice, from, the, 4th, duke, of, buccleuch, who, counselled, him, to, retain, his, literary, independence, the, position, went, to, scott, s, friend, robert, southey, scott, was, influenced, by, gothic, romance, and, had, collaborated, in, 1801, with, monk, lewis, on, tales, of, wonder, scott, s, career, as, a, novelist, was, attended, with, uncertainty, the, first, few, chapters, of, waverley, were, complete, by, roughly, 1805, but, the, project, was, abandoned, as, a, result, of, unfavourable, criticism, from, a, friend, soon, after, scott, was, asked, by, the, publisher, john, murray, to, posthumously, edit, and, complete, the, last, chapter, of, an, unfinished, romance, by, joseph, strutt, published, in, 1808, and, set, in, 15th, century, england, queenhoo, hall, was, not, a, success, due, to, its, archaic, language, and, excessive, display, of, antiquarian, information, the, success, of, scott, s, highland, narrative, poem, the, lady, of, the, lake, in, 1810, seems, to, have, put, it, into, his, head, to, resume, the, narrative, and, have, his, hero, edward, waverley, journey, to, scotland, although, waverley, was, announced, for, publication, at, that, stage, it, was, again, laid, by, and, not, resumed, until, late, 1813, then, published, in, 1814, only, a, thousand, copies, were, printed, but, the, work, was, an, immediate, success, and, 3, 000, more, were, added, in, two, further, editions, the, same, year, waverley, turned, out, to, be, the, first, of, 27, novels, eight, published, in, pairs, and, by, the, time, the, sixth, of, them, rob, roy, was, published, the, print, run, for, the, first, edition, had, been, increased, to, 10, 000, copies, which, became, the, norm, given, scott, s, established, status, as, a, poet, and, the, tentative, nature, of, waverley, s, emergence, it, is, not, surprising, that, he, followed, a, common, practice, in, the, period, and, published, it, anonymously, he, continued, this, until, his, financial, ruin, in, 1826, the, novels, mostly, appearing, as, by, the, author, of, waverley, or, variants, thereof, or, as, tales, of, my, landlord, it, is, not, clear, why, he, chose, to, do, this, no, fewer, than, eleven, reasons, have, been, suggested, especially, as, it, was, a, fairly, open, secret, but, as, he, himself, said, with, shylock, such, was, my, humour, scott, was, an, almost, exclusively, historical, novelist, only, one, of, his, 27, novels, saint, ronan, s, well, has, a, wholly, modern, setting, the, settings, of, the, others, range, from, 1794, in, the, antiquary, back, to, 1096, or, 1097, the, time, of, the, first, crusade, in, count, robert, of, paris, sixteen, take, place, in, scotland, the, first, nine, from, waverley, 1814, to, a, legend, of, montrose, 1819, all, have, scottish, locations, and, 17th, or, 18th, century, settings, scott, was, better, versed, in, his, material, than, anyone, he, could, draw, on, oral, tradition, and, a, wide, range, of, written, sources, in, his, ever, expanding, library, many, of, the, books, rare, and, some, unique, copies, in, general, it, is, these, pre, 1820, novels, that, have, drawn, the, attention, of, modern, critics, especially, waverley, with, its, presentation, of, the, 1745, jacobites, drawn, from, the, highland, clans, as, obsolete, and, fanatical, idealists, old, mortality, 1816, with, its, treatment, of, the, 1679, covenanters, as, fanatical, and, often, ridiculous, prompting, john, galt, to, produce, a, contrasting, picture, in, his, novel, ringan, gilhaize, in, 1823, the, heart, of, mid, lothian, 1818, with, its, low, born, heroine, jeanie, deans, making, a, perilous, journey, to, richmond, in, 1737, to, secure, a, promised, royal, pardon, for, her, sister, falsely, accused, of, infanticide, and, the, tragic, the, bride, of, lammermoor, 1819, with, its, stern, account, of, a, declined, aristocratic, family, with, edgar, ravenswood, and, his, fianc, e, as, victims, of, the, wife, of, an, upstart, lawyer, in, a, time, of, political, power, struggle, before, the, act, of, union, in, 1707, in, 1820, in, a, bold, move, scott, shifted, period, and, location, for, ivanhoe, 1820, to, 12th, century, england, this, meant, he, was, dependent, on, a, limited, range, of, sources, all, of, them, printed, he, had, to, bring, together, material, from, different, centuries, and, invent, an, artificial, form, of, speech, based, on, elizabethan, and, jacobean, drama, the, result, is, as, much, myth, as, history, but, the, novel, remains, his, best, known, work, the, most, likely, to, be, found, by, the, general, reader, eight, of, the, subsequent, 17, novels, also, have, medieval, settings, though, most, are, set, towards, the, end, of, the, era, for, which, scott, had, a, better, supply, of, contemporaneous, sources, his, familiarity, with, elizabethan, and, 17th, century, english, literature, partly, resulting, from, editorial, work, on, pamphlets, and, other, minor, publications, meant, that, four, of, his, works, set, in, the, england, of, that, period, kenilworth, 1821, the, fortunes, of, nigel, and, peveril, of, the, peak, 1821, and, woodstock, 1826, present, rich, pictures, of, their, societies, the, most, generally, esteemed, of, scott, s, later, fictions, though, are, three, short, stories, a, supernatural, narrative, in, scots, wandering, willie, s, tale, in, redgauntlet, 1824, and, the, highland, widow, and, the, two, drovers, in, chronicles, of, the, canongate, 1827, crucial, to, scott, s, historical, thinking, is, the, concept, that, very, different, societies, can, move, through, the, same, stages, as, they, develop, and, that, humanity, is, basically, unchanging, or, as, he, puts, it, in, the, first, chapter, of, waverley, that, there, are, passions, common, to, men, in, all, stages, of, society, and, which, have, alike, agitated, the, human, heart, whether, it, throbbed, under, the, steel, corslet, of, the, fifteenth, century, the, brocaded, coat, of, the, eighteenth, or, the, blue, frock, and, white, dimity, waistcoat, of, the, present, day, it, was, one, of, scott, s, main, achievements, to, give, lively, detailed, pictures, of, different, stages, of, scottish, british, and, european, society, while, making, it, clear, that, for, all, the, differences, in, form, they, took, the, same, human, passions, as, those, of, his, own, age, his, readers, could, therefore, appreciate, the, depiction, of, an, unfamiliar, society, while, having, no, difficulty, in, relating, to, the, characters, scott, is, fascinated, by, striking, moments, of, transition, between, stages, in, societies, samuel, taylor, coleridge, in, a, discussion, of, scott, s, early, novels, found, that, they, derive, their, long, sustained, interest, from, the, contest, between, the, two, great, moving, principles, of, social, humanity, religious, adherence, to, the, past, and, the, ancient, the, desire, the, admiration, of, permanence, on, the, one, hand, and, the, passion, for, increase, of, knowledge, for, truth, as, the, offspring, of, reason, in, short, the, mighty, instincts, of, progression, and, free, agency, on, the, other, this, is, clear, for, example, in, waverley, as, the, hero, is, captivated, by, the, romantic, allure, of, the, jacobite, cause, embodied, in, bonnie, prince, charlie, and, his, followers, before, accepting, that, the, time, for, such, enthusiasms, has, passed, and, accepting, the, more, rational, humdrum, reality, of, hanoverian, britain, another, example, appears, in, 15th, century, europe, in, the, yielding, of, the, old, chivalric, world, view, of, charles, duke, of, burgundy, to, the, machiavellian, pragmatism, of, louis, xi, scott, is, intrigued, by, the, way, different, stages, of, societal, development, can, exist, side, by, side, in, one, country, when, waverley, has, his, first, experience, of, highland, ways, after, a, raid, on, his, lowland, host, s, cattle, it, seemed, like, a, dream, that, these, deeds, of, violence, should, be, familiar, to, men, s, minds, and, currently, talked, of, as, falling, with, the, common, order, of, things, and, happening, daily, in, the, immediate, neighbourhood, without, his, having, crossed, the, seas, and, while, he, was, yet, in, the, otherwise, well, ordered, island, of, great, britain, a, more, complex, version, of, this, comes, in, scott, s, second, novel, guy, mannering, 1815, which, set, in, 1781, 2, offers, no, simple, opposition, the, scotland, represented, in, the, novel, is, at, once, backward, and, advanced, traditional, and, modern, it, is, a, country, in, varied, stages, of, progression, in, which, there, are, many, social, subsets, each, with, its, own, laws, and, customs, scott, s, process, of, composition, can, be, traced, through, the, manuscripts, mostly, preserved, the, more, fragmentary, sets, of, proofs, his, correspondence, and, publisher, s, records, he, did, not, create, detailed, plans, for, his, stories, and, the, remarks, by, the, figure, of, the, author, in, the, introductory, epistle, to, the, fortunes, of, nigel, probably, reflect, his, own, experience, i, think, there, is, a, d, mon, who, seats, himself, on, the, feather, of, my, pen, when, i, begin, to, write, and, leads, it, astray, from, the, purpose, characters, expand, under, my, hand, incidents, are, multiplied, the, story, lingers, while, the, materials, increase, my, regular, mansion, turns, out, a, gothic, anomaly, and, the, work, is, complete, long, before, i, have, attained, the, point, i, proposed, yet, the, manuscripts, rarely, show, major, deletions, or, changes, of, direction, and, scott, could, clearly, keep, control, of, his, narrative, that, was, important, for, as, soon, as, he, had, made, fair, progress, with, a, novel, he, would, start, sending, batches, of, manuscript, to, be, copied, to, preserve, his, anonymity, and, the, copies, were, sent, to, be, set, up, in, type, as, usual, at, the, time, the, compositors, would, supply, the, punctuation, he, received, proofs, also, in, batches, and, made, many, changes, at, that, stage, but, these, were, almost, always, local, corrections, and, enhancements, as, the, number, of, novels, grew, they, were, republished, in, small, collections, novels, and, tales, 1819, waverley, to, a, tale, of, montrose, historical, romances, 1822, ivanhoe, to, kenilworth, novels, and, romances, 1824, the, pirate, to, quentin, durward, and, two, series, of, tales, and, romances, 1827, st, ronan, s, well, to, woodstock, 1833, chronicles, of, the, canongate, to, castle, dangerous, in, his, last, years, scott, marked, up, interleaved, copies, of, these, collected, editions, to, produce, a, final, version, of, what, were, now, officially, the, waverley, novels, often, called, his, magnum, opus, or, magnum, edition, scott, provided, each, novel, with, an, introduction, and, notes, and, made, mostly, piecemeal, adjustments, to, the, text, issued, in, 48, smart, monthly, volumes, between, june, 1829, and, may, 1833, at, a, modest, price, of, five, shillings, 25p, these, were, an, innovative, and, profitable, venture, aimed, at, a, wide, readership, the, print, run, was, an, astonishing, 30, 000, in, a, general, preface, to, the, magnum, edition, scott, wrote, that, one, factor, prompting, him, to, resume, work, on, the, waverley, manuscript, in, 1813, had, been, a, desire, to, do, for, scotland, what, had, been, done, in, the, fiction, of, maria, edgeworth, whose, irish, characters, have, gone, so, far, to, make, the, english, familiar, with, the, character, of, their, gay, and, kind, hearted, neighbours, of, ireland, that, she, may, be, truly, said, to, have, done, more, towards, completing, the, union, than, perhaps, all, the, legislative, enactments, by, which, it, has, been, followed, up, most, of, scott, s, readers, were, english, with, quentin, durward, 1823, and, woodstock, 1826, for, example, some, 8000, of, the, 10, 000, copies, of, the, first, edition, went, to, london, in, the, scottish, novels, the, lower, class, characters, normally, speak, scots, but, scott, is, careful, not, to, make, the, scots, too, dense, so, that, those, unfamiliar, with, it, can, follow, the, gist, without, understanding, every, word, some, have, also, argued, that, although, scott, was, formally, a, supporter, of, the, union, with, england, and, ireland, his, novels, have, a, strong, nationalist, subtext, for, readers, attuned, to, that, wavelength, scott, s, new, career, as, a, novelist, in, 1814, did, not, mean, he, abandoned, poetry, the, waverley, novels, contain, much, original, verse, including, familiar, songs, such, as, proud, maisie, from, the, heart, of, mid, lothian, ch, 41, and, look, not, thou, on, beauty, s, charming, from, the, bride, of, lammermoor, ch, 3, in, most, of, the, novels, scott, preceded, each, chapter, with, an, epigram, or, motto, most, of, these, are, in, verse, and, many, are, of, his, own, composition, often, imitating, other, writers, such, as, beaumont, and, fletcher, prompted, by, scott, the, prince, regent, the, future, george, iv, gave, scott, and, other, officials, permission, in, a, royal, warrant, dated, 28, october, 1817, to, conduct, a, search, for, the, crown, jewels, honours, of, scotland, during, the, protectorate, under, cromwell, these, had, been, hidden, away, but, had, subsequently, been, used, to, crown, charles, ii, they, were, not, used, to, crown, subsequent, monarchs, but, were, regularly, taken, to, sittings, of, parliament, to, represent, the, absent, monarch, until, the, act, of, union, 1707, so, the, honours, were, stored, in, edinburgh, castle, but, their, large, locked, box, was, not, opened, for, more, than, 100, years, and, stories, circulated, that, they, had, been, lost, or, removed, on, 4, february, 1818, scott, and, a, small, military, team, opened, the, box, and, unearthed, the, honours, from, the, crown, room, of, edinburgh, castle, on, 19, august, 1818, through, scott, s, effort, his, friend, adam, ferguson, was, appointed, deputy, keeper, of, the, scottish, regalia, the, scottish, patronage, system, swung, into, action, and, after, elaborate, negotiations, the, prince, regent, granted, scott, the, title, of, baronet, in, april, 1820, he, received, the, baronetcy, in, london, becoming, sir, walter, scott, 1st, baronet, after, george, s, accession, the, city, council, of, edinburgh, invited, scott, at, the, sovereign, s, behest, to, stage, manage, the, 1822, visit, of, king, george, iv, to, scotland, in, spite, of, having, only, three, weeks, to, work, with, scott, created, a, spectacular, comprehensive, pageant, designed, not, only, to, impress, the, king, but, in, some, way, to, heal, the, rifts, that, had, destabilised, scots, society, probably, fortified, by, his, vivid, depiction, of, the, pageant, staged, for, the, reception, of, queen, elizabeth, in, kenilworth, he, and, his, production, team, mounted, what, in, modern, days, would, be, a, pr, event, with, the, king, dressed, in, tartan, and, greeted, by, his, people, many, of, them, also, in, similar, tartan, ceremonial, dress, this, form, of, dress, proscribed, after, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1745, became, one, of, the, seminal, potent, and, ubiquitous, symbols, of, scottish, identity, in, 1825, a, uk, wide, banking, crisis, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, the, ballantyne, printing, business, of, which, scott, was, the, only, partner, with, a, financial, interest, its, debts, of, 130, 000, equivalent, to, 13, 500, 000, in, 2023, caused, his, very, public, ruin, rather, than, declare, himself, bankrupt, or, accept, any, financial, support, from, his, many, supporters, and, admirers, including, the, king, himself, he, placed, his, house, and, income, in, a, trust, belonging, to, his, creditors, and, set, out, to, write, his, way, out, of, debt, to, add, to, his, burdens, his, wife, charlotte, died, in, 1826, despite, these, events, or, because, of, them, scott, kept, up, his, prodigious, output, between, 1826, and, 1832, he, produced, six, novels, two, short, stories, and, two, plays, eleven, works, or, volumes, of, non, fiction, and, a, journal, along, with, several, unfinished, works, the, non, fiction, included, the, life, of, napoleon, buonaparte, in, 1827, two, volumes, of, the, history, of, scotland, in, 1829, and, 1830, and, four, instalments, of, the, series, entitled, tales, of, a, grandfather, being, stories, taken, from, scottish, history, written, one, per, year, over, the, period, 1828, 1831, among, several, others, finally, scott, had, recently, been, inspired, by, the, diaries, of, samuel, pepys, and, lord, byron, and, he, began, keeping, a, journal, over, the, period, which, however, would, not, be, published, until, 1890, as, the, journal, of, sir, walter, scott, by, then, scott, s, health, was, failing, and, on, 29, october, 1831, in, a, vain, search, for, improvement, he, set, off, on, a, voyage, to, malta, and, naples, on, board, hms, barham, a, frigate, put, at, his, disposal, by, the, admiralty, he, was, welcomed, and, celebrated, wherever, he, went, on, his, journey, home, he, boarded, the, steamboat, prins, frederik, going, from, cologne, to, rotterdam, while, on, board, he, had, a, final, stroke, near, emmerich, after, local, treatment, a, steamboat, took, him, to, the, steamship, batavier, which, left, for, england, on, 12, june, by, pure, coincidence, mary, martha, sherwood, was, also, on, board, she, would, later, write, about, this, encounter, after, he, was, landed, in, england, scott, was, transported, back, to, die, at, abbotsford, on, 21, september, 1832, he, was, 61, scott, was, buried, in, dryburgh, abbey, where, his, wife, had, earlier, been, interred, lady, scott, had, been, buried, as, an, episcopalian, at, scott, s, own, funeral, three, ministers, of, the, church, of, scotland, officiated, at, abbotsford, and, the, service, at, dryburgh, was, conducted, by, an, episcopal, clergyman, although, scott, died, owing, money, his, novels, continued, to, sell, and, the, debts, encumbering, his, estate, were, discharged, shortly, after, his, death, scott, was, raised, as, a, presbyterian, in, the, church, of, scotland, he, was, ordained, as, an, elder, in, duddingston, kirk, in, 1806, and, sat, in, the, general, assembly, for, a, time, as, representative, elder, of, the, burgh, of, selkirk, in, adult, life, he, also, adhered, to, the, scottish, episcopal, church, he, seldom, attended, church, but, read, the, book, of, common, prayer, services, in, family, worship, scott, s, father, was, a, freemason, being, a, member, of, lodge, st, david, no, 36, edinburgh, and, scott, also, became, a, freemason, in, his, father, s, lodge, in, 1801, albeit, only, after, the, death, of, his, father, when, scott, was, a, boy, he, sometimes, travelled, with, his, father, from, selkirk, to, melrose, where, some, of, his, novels, are, set, at, a, certain, spot, the, old, gentleman, would, stop, the, carriage, and, take, his, son, to, a, stone, on, the, site, of, the, battle, of, melrose, 1526, during, the, summers, from, 1804, scott, made, his, home, at, the, large, house, of, ashestiel, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, tweed, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, north, of, selkirk, when, his, lease, on, this, property, expired, in, 1811, he, bought, cartley, hole, farm, downstream, on, the, tweed, nearer, melrose, the, farm, had, the, nickname, of, clarty, hole, and, scott, renamed, it, abbotsford, after, a, neighbouring, ford, used, by, the, monks, of, melrose, abbey, following, a, modest, enlargement, of, the, original, farmhouse, in, 1811, 12, massive, expansions, took, place, in, 1816, 19, and, 1822, 24, scott, described, the, resulting, building, as, a, sort, of, romance, in, architecture, and, a, kind, of, conundrum, castle, to, be, sure, with, his, architects, william, atkinson, and, edward, blore, scott, was, a, pioneer, of, the, scottish, baronial, style, of, architecture, and, abbotsford, is, festooned, with, turrets, and, stepped, gabling, through, windows, enriched, with, the, insignia, of, heraldry, the, sun, shone, on, suits, of, armour, trophies, of, the, chase, a, library, of, more, than, 9, 000, volumes, fine, furniture, and, still, finer, pictures, panelling, of, oak, and, cedar, and, carved, ceilings, relieved, by, coats, of, arms, in, their, correct, colours, added, to, the, beauty, of, the, house, it, is, estimated, that, the, building, cost, scott, more, than, 25, 000, equivalent, to, 2, 600, 000, in, 2023, more, land, was, purchased, until, scott, owned, nearly, 1, 000, acres, 4, 0, km, 2, in, 1817, as, part, of, the, land, purchases, scott, bought, the, nearby, mansion, house, of, toftfield, for, his, friend, adam, ferguson, to, live, in, along, with, his, brothers, and, sisters, and, on, which, at, the, ladies, request, he, bestowed, the, name, of, huntlyburn, ferguson, commissioned, sir, david, wilkie, to, paint, the, scott, family, resulting, in, the, painting, the, abbotsford, family, in, which, scott, is, seated, with, his, family, represented, as, a, group, of, country, folk, ferguson, is, standing, to, the, right, with, the, feather, in, his, cap, and, thomas, scott, scott, s, uncle, is, behind, the, painting, was, exhibited, at, the, royal, academy, in, 1818, abbotsford, later, gave, its, name, to, the, abbotsford, club, founded, in, 1834, in, memory, of, sir, walter, scott, although, he, continued, to, be, extremely, popular, and, widely, read, both, at, home, and, abroad, scott, s, critical, reputation, declined, in, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, as, serious, writers, turned, from, romanticism, to, realism, and, scott, began, to, be, regarded, as, an, author, suitable, for, children, this, trend, accelerated, in, the, 20th, century, for, example, in, his, classic, study, aspects, of, the, novel, 1927, e, m, forster, harshly, criticized, scott, s, clumsy, and, slapdash, writing, style, flat, characters, and, thin, plots, in, contrast, the, novels, of, scott, s, contemporary, jane, austen, once, appreciated, only, by, a, discerning, few, including, as, it, happened, scott, himself, rose, steadily, in, critical, esteem, though, austen, as, a, female, writer, was, still, faulted, for, her, narrow, feminine, choice, of, subject, matter, which, unlike, scott, avoided, the, grand, historical, themes, traditionally, viewed, as, masculine, nevertheless, scott, s, importance, as, an, innovator, continued, to, be, recognised, he, was, acclaimed, as, the, inventor, of, the, genre, of, the, modern, historical, novel, which, others, trace, to, jane, porter, whose, work, in, the, genre, predates, scott, s, and, the, inspiration, for, enormous, numbers, of, imitators, and, genre, writers, both, in, britain, and, on, the, european, continent, in, the, cultural, sphere, scott, s, waverley, novels, played, a, significant, part, in, the, movement, begun, with, james, macpherson, s, ossian, cycle, in, rehabilitating, the, public, perception, of, the, scottish, highlands, and, its, culture, which, had, been, formerly, been, viewed, by, the, southern, mind, as, a, barbaric, breeding, ground, of, hill, bandits, religious, fanaticism, and, jacobite, risings, scott, served, as, chairman, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, and, was, also, a, member, of, the, royal, celtic, society, his, own, contribution, to, the, reinvention, of, scottish, culture, was, enormous, even, though, his, re, creations, of, the, customs, of, the, highlands, were, fanciful, at, times, through, the, medium, of, scott, s, novels, the, violent, religious, and, political, conflicts, of, the, country, s, recent, past, could, be, seen, as, belonging, to, history, which, scott, defined, as, the, subtitle, of, waverley, tis, sixty, years, since, indicates, as, something, that, happened, at, least, 60, years, earlier, his, advocacy, of, objectivity, and, moderation, and, his, strong, repudiation, of, political, violence, on, either, side, also, had, a, strong, though, unspoken, contemporary, resonance, in, an, era, when, many, conservative, english, speakers, lived, in, mortal, fear, of, a, revolution, in, the, french, style, on, british, soil, scott, s, orchestration, of, king, george, iv, s, visit, to, scotland, in, 1822, was, a, pivotal, event, intended, to, inspire, a, view, of, his, home, country, that, accentuated, the, positive, aspects, of, the, past, while, allowing, the, age, of, quasi, medieval, blood, letting, to, be, put, to, rest, while, envisioning, a, more, useful, peaceful, future, after, scott, s, work, had, been, essentially, unstudied, for, many, decades, a, revival, of, critical, interest, began, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, while, f, r, leavis, had, disdained, scott, seeing, him, as, a, thoroughly, bad, novelist, and, a, thoroughly, bad, influence, the, great, tradition, gy, rgy, luk, cs, the, historical, novel, and, david, daiches, scott, s, achievement, as, a, novelist, offered, a, marxian, political, reading, of, scott, s, fiction, that, generated, a, great, deal, of, interest, in, his, work, these, were, followed, in, 1966, by, a, major, thematic, analysis, covering, most, of, the, novels, by, francis, r, hart, scott, s, novels, the, plotting, of, historic, survival, scott, has, proved, particularly, responsive, to, postmodern, approaches, most, notably, to, the, concept, of, the, interplay, of, multiple, voices, highlighted, by, mikhail, bakhtin, as, suggested, by, the, title, of, the, volume, with, selected, papers, from, the, fourth, international, scott, conference, held, in, edinburgh, in, 1991, scott, in, carnival, scott, is, now, increasingly, recognised, not, only, as, the, principal, inventor, of, the, historical, novel, and, a, key, figure, in, the, development, of, scottish, and, world, literature, but, also, as, a, writer, of, a, depth, and, subtlety, who, challenges, his, readers, as, well, as, entertaining, them, during, his, lifetime, scott, s, portrait, was, painted, by, sir, edwin, landseer, and, fellow, scots, sir, henry, raeburn, and, james, eckford, lauder, in, 1824, by, c, r, leslie, later, engraved, by, m, i, danforth, in, 1829, after, watts, souvenir, of, 1829, was, published, close, friends, and, family, said, that, it, was, the, best, engraving, that, had, yet, appeared, of, the, likeness, of, the, author, of, waverley, watts, souvenir, 1829, post, scott, s, life, 1833, w, j, thompson, painted, a, miniature, for, a, gold, memorial, locket, shown, in, william, john, thompson, in, edinburgh, the, 61, 1, metre, tall, victorian, gothic, spire, of, the, scott, monument, was, designed, by, george, meikle, kemp, it, was, completed, in, 1844, 12, years, after, scott, s, death, and, dominates, the, south, side, of, princes, street, scott, is, also, commemorated, on, a, stone, slab, in, makars, court, outside, the, writers, museum, lawnmarket, edinburgh, along, with, other, prominent, scottish, writers, quotes, from, his, work, are, also, visible, on, the, canongate, wall, of, the, scottish, parliament, building, in, holyrood, there, is, a, tower, dedicated, to, his, memory, on, corstorphine, hill, in, the, west, of, the, city, and, edinburgh, s, waverley, railway, station, opened, in, 1854, takes, its, name, from, his, first, novel, in, glasgow, walter, scott, s, monument, dominates, the, centre, of, george, square, the, main, public, square, in, the, city, designed, by, david, rhind, in, 1838, the, monument, features, a, large, column, topped, by, a, statue, of, scott, there, is, a, statue, of, scott, in, new, york, city, s, central, park, numerous, masonic, lodges, have, been, named, after, scott, and, his, novels, for, example, lodge, sir, walter, scott, no, 859, perth, australia, and, lodge, waverley, no, 597, edinburgh, scotland, the, annual, walter, scott, prize, for, historical, fiction, was, created, in, 2010, by, the, duke, and, duchess, of, buccleuch, whose, ancestors, were, closely, linked, to, sir, walter, scott, at, 25, 000, it, is, one, of, the, largest, prizes, in, british, literature, the, award, has, been, presented, at, scott, s, historic, home, abbotsford, house, scott, has, been, credited, with, rescuing, the, scottish, banknote, in, 1826, there, was, outrage, in, scotland, at, the, attempt, of, parliament, to, prevent, the, production, of,

first, time, a, sense, of, the, past, as, a, place, where, people, thought, felt, and, dressed, differently, his, historical, romances, influenced, balzac, dostoevsky, flaubert, tolstoy, dumas,

something, strange, and, marvelous, in, the, talent, of, this, man, who, disposes, of, his, reader, as, the, wind, disposes, of, a, leaf, who, leads, him, at, his, will, into, all, places, and, into, all, times, unveils, for, him, with, ease, the, most, secret, recesses, of, the, heart, as, well, as, the, most, mysterious, phenomena, of, nature, as, well, as, the, obscurest, pages, of, history, whose, imagination, caresses, and, dominates, all, other, imaginations, clothes, with, the, same, astonishing, truth, the, beggar, with, his, rags, and, the, king, with, his, robes, assumes, all, manners, adopts, all, garbs, speaks, all, languages, leaves, to, the, physiognomy, of, the, ages, all, that, is, immutable, and, eternal, in, their, lineaments, traced, there, by, the, wisdom, of, god, and, all, that, is, variable, and, fleeting, planted, there, by, the, follies, of, men, does, not, force, like, certain, ignorant, romancers, the, personages, of, the, past, to, colour, themselves, with, our, brushes, and, smear, themselves, with, our, varnish, but, compels, by, his, magic, power, the, contemporary, reader, to, imbue, himself, at, least, for, some, hours, with, the, spirit, of, the, old, times, today, so, much, scorned, like, a, wise, and, adroit, adviser, inviting, ungrateful, children, to, return, to, their, father, alessandro, manzoni, s, the, betrothed, 1827,

melodramatic, castles, where, lifeless, mannequins, stalk, about, dressed, in, leotards, in, the, novella, however, cramer, proves, as, deluded, a, romantic, as, any, hero, in, one, of, scott, s,

or, two, put, them, into, our, novels, it, would, be, a, fine, help, to, a, volume, we, could, make, our, heroine, read, it, aloud, of, a, sunday, evening, just, as, well, as, isabella, wardour, in,

to, me, that, i, should, intrude, on, your, ground, or, to, compliment, one, all, the, world, so, highly, appreciates, but, as, every, traveller, when, they, visit, the, alps, endeavours, however, imperfectly, to, express, their, admiration, in, the, inn, s, album, so, it, is, impossible, to, address, the, author, of, waverley, without, thanking, him, for, the, delight, and, instruction, derived, from, the, inexhaustible, source, of, his, genius, and, trying, to, express, a, part, of, the, enthusiastic, admiration, his, works, inspire, in, charlotte, bront, s, jane, eyre, 1847, st,

novels, of, walter, scott, in, particular, according, to, juliet, barker, rob, roy, 1817, had, a, significant, influence, on, bront, s, novel, which, though, regarded, as, the, archetypal, yorkshire, novel, owed, as, much, if, not, more, to, walter, scott, s, border, country, rob, roy, is, set, in, the, wilds, of, northumberland, among, the, uncouth, and, quarrelsome, squirearchical,

thing, a, very, superior, publication, entitled, ivanhoe, you, will, not, get, any, writer, to, beat, him, in, a, hurry, i, think, he, will, not, in, my, opinion, be, speedily, surpassed, i, have, just, been, reading, a, portion, at, the, commencement, of, anne, of, jeersteen, it, commences, well, thomas, hardy, in, his, 1888, essay, the, profitable, reading, of, fiction, writes, tested, by, such, considerations, as, these, there, are, obviously, many, volumes, of, fiction, remarkable, and, even, great, in, their, character, drawing, their, feeling, their, philosophy, which, are, quite, second, rate, in, their, structural, quality, as, narratives, their, fewness, is, remarkable, and, bears, out, the, opinion, expressed, earlier, in, this, essay, that, the, art, of, novel, writing, is, as, yet, in, its, tentative, stage, only, the, bride, of, lammermoor, is, an, almost, perfect, specimen, of, form, which, is, the, more, remarkable, in, that, scott, as, a, rule, depends, more, upon, episode, dialogue, and, description, for, exciting, interest, than, upon, the, well, knit, interdependence, of, parts, the, many, other, british, novelists, whom, scott, influenced, included, edward, bulwer, lytton, charles, kingsley, and, robert, louis, stevenson, he, also, shaped, children, s, writers, like, charlotte, yonge, and, g, a, henty, nathaniel, hawthorne, in, a, letter, to,

other, poems, i, shall, read, the, abbot, by, the, author, of, waverley, as, soon, as, i, can, hire, it, i, have, read, all, of, scott, s, novels, except, that, i, wish, i, had, not, that, i, might, have, the, pleasure, of, reading, them, again, edgar, allan, poe, an, admirer, of, scott, was, particularly, captivated, with, the, bride, of, lammermoor, calling, it, that, purest, and, most, enthralling, of, fictions, and, the, master, novel, of, scott, in, a, speech, delivered, at, salem, massachusetts, on, 6, january, 1860, to, raise, money, for, the, families, of, the, executed, abolitionist, john, brown, and, his, followers, ralph, waldo, emerson, calls, brown, an, example, of, true, chivalry, which, consists, not, in, noble, birth, but, in, helping, the, weak, and, defenseless, and, declares, that, walter, scott, would, have, delighted, to, draw, his, picture, and, trace, his, adventurous, career, henry, james, in, his, 1864, essay, fiction, and, sir, walter, scott, writes, scott, was, a, born, story, teller, we, can, give, him, no, higher, praise, surveying, his, works, his, character, his, method, as, a, whole, we, can, liken, him, to, nothing, better, than, to, a, strong, and, kindly, elder, brother, who, gathers, his, juvenile, public, about, him, at, eventide, and, pours, out, a, stream, of, wondrous, improvisation, who, cannot, remember, an, experience, like, this, on, no, occasion, are, the, delights, of, fiction, so, intense, fiction, these, are, the, triumphs, of, fact, in, the, richness, of, his, invention, and, memory, in, the, infinitude, of, his, knowledge, in, his, improvidence, for, the, future, in, the, skill, with, which, he, answers, or, rather, parries, sudden, questions, in, his, low, voiced, pathos, and, his, resounding, merriment, he, is, identical, with, the, ideal, fireside, chronicler, and, thoroughly, to, enjoy, him, we, must, again, become, as, credulous, as, children, at, twilight, in, his, 1870, memoir, army, life, in, a, black, regiment, new, england, abolitionist, thomas, wentworth, higginson, later, editor, of, emily, dickinson, described, how, he, wrote, down, and, preserved, negro, spirituals, or, shouts, while, serving, as, a, colonel, in, the, first, south, carolina, volunteers, the, first, authorized, union, army, regiment, recruited, from, freedmen, during, the, civil, war, he, wrote, that, he, was, a, faithful, student, of, the, scottish, ballads, and, had, always, envied, sir, walter, the, delight, of, tracing, them, out, amid, their, own, heather, and, of, writing, them, down, piecemeal, from, the, lips, of, aged, crones, according, to, marx, s, daughter, eleanor, scott, was, an, author, to, whom, karl, marx, again, and, again, returned, whom, he, admired, and, knew, as, well, as, he, did, balzac, and, fielding, mark, twain, in, his, 1883, life, on, the, mississippi, satirized, the, impact, of, scott, s, writings, declaring, with, humorous, hyperbole, that, scott, had, so, large, a, hand, in, making, southern, character, as, it, existed, before, the, war, that, he, is, in, great, measure, responsible, for, the, war, he, goes, on, to, coin, the, term, sir, walter, scott, disease, describing, a, respect, for, aristocracy, a, social, acceptance, of, duels, and, vendettas, and, a, taste, for, fantasy, and, romanticism, which, he, blames, for, the, south, s, lack, of, advancement, twain, also, targeted, scott, in, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, where, he, names, a, sinking, boat, the, walter, scott, 1884, and, in, a, connecticut, yankee, in, king, arthur, s, court, 1889, the, main, character, repeatedly, utters, great, scott, as, an, oath, by, the, end, of, the, book, however, he, has, become, absorbed, in, the, world, of, knights, in, armour, reflecting, twain, s, ambivalence, on, the, topic, in, anne, of, green, gables, 1908, by, lucy, maude, montgomery, as, anne, is, bringing, in, the, cows, from, pasture, the, cows, swung, placidly, down, the, lane, and, anne, followed, them, dreamily, repeating, aloud, the, battle, canto, from, marmion, which, had, also, been, part, of, their, english, course, the, preceding, winter, and, which, miss, stacy, had, made, them, learn, off, by, heart, and, exulting, in, its, rushing, lines, and, the, clash, of, spears, in, its, imagery, when, she, came, to, the, lines, the, stubborn, spearsmen, still, made, good, their, dark, impenetrable, wood, she, stopped, in, ecstasy, to, shut, her, eyes, that, she, might, the, better, fancy, herself, one, of, that, heroic, ring, the, idyllic, cape, cod, retreat, of, suffragists, verena, tarrant, and, olive, chancellor, in, henry, james, s, the, bostonians, 1886, is, called, marmion, evoking, what, james, considered, the, quixotic, idealism, of, such, social, reformers, in, to, the, lighthouse, by, virginia, woolf, mrs, ramsey, glances, at, her, husband, he, was, reading, something, that, moved, him, very, much, he, was, tossing, the, pages, over, he, was, acting, it, perhaps, he, was, thinking, himself, the, person, in, the, book, she, wondered, what, book, it, was, oh, it, was, one, of, old, sir, walter, s, she, saw, adjusting, the, shade, of, her, lamp, so, that, the, light, fell, on, her, knitting, for, charles, tansley, had, been, saying, she, looked, up, as, if, she, expected, to, hear, the, crash, of, books, on, the, floor, above, had, been, saying, that, people, don, t, read, scott, any, more, then, her, husband, thought, that, s, what, they, ll, say, of, me, so, he, went, and, got, one, of, those, books, it, fortified, him, he, clean, forgot, all, the, little, rubs, and, digs, of, the, evening, and, his, being, so, irritable, with, his, wife, and, so, touchy, and, minding, when, they, passed, his, books, over, as, if, they, didn, t, exist, at, all, feeling, for, straight, forward, simple, things, these, fishermen, the, poor, old, crazed, creature, in, mucklebackit, s, cottage, made, him, feel, so, vigorous, so, relieved, of, something, that, he, felt, roused, and, triumphant, and, could, not, choke, back, his, tears, raising, the, book, a, little, to, hide, his, face, he, let, them, fall, and, shook, his, head, from, side, to, side, and, forgot, himself, completely, but, not, one, or, two, reflections, about, morality, and, french, novels, and, english, novels, and, scott, s, hands, being, tied, but, his, view, perhaps, being, as, true, as, the, other, view, forgot, his, own, bothers, and, failures, completely, in, poor, steenie, s, drowning, and, mucklebackit, s, sorrow, that, was, scott, at, his, best, and, the, astonishing, delight, and, feeling, of, vigor, that, it, gave, him, well, let, them, improve, upon, that, he, thought, as, he, finished, the, chapter, the, whole, of, life, did, not, consist, in, going, to, bed, with, a, woman, he, thought, returning, to, scott, and, balzac, to, the, english, novel, and, the, french, novel, virginia, woolf, in, a, letter, to, hugh, walpole, on, 12, september, 1932, writes, i, don, t, know, him, accurately, and, minutely, as, you, do, but, only, in, a, warm, scattered, amourous, way, now, you, have, put, an, edge, on, my, love, and, if, it, weren, t, that, i, must, read, mss, how, they, flock, i, should, plunge, you, urge, me, almost, beyond, endurance, to, plunge, once, more, yes, i, say, to, myself, i, shall, read, the, monastery, again, and, then, i, shall, go, back, to, midlothian, i, cant, read, the, bride, because, i, know, it, almost, by, heart, also, the, antiquary, i, think, those, two, as, a, whole, are, my, favourites, well, to, inspire, a, harassed, hack, to, this, wish, to, kick, up, her, heels, what, greater, proof, could, there, be, of, your, powers, of, persuasion, and, illumination, my, only, complaint, is, that, you, pay, too, much, attention, to, the, arid, gulls, who, can, t, open, their, beaks, wide, enough, to, swallow, sir, walter, one, of, the, things, i, want, to, write, about, one, day, is, the, shakespearean, talk, in, scott, the, dialogues, surely, that, is, the, last, appearance, in, england, of, the, blank, verse, of, falstaff, and, so, on, we, have, lost, the, art, of, the, poetic, speech, john, cowper, powys, described, walter, scott, s, romances, as, by, far, the, most, powerful, literary, influence, of, my, life, this, can, be, seen,
