robert, andrews, millikan, march, 22, 1868, december, 19, 1953, was, an, american, experimental, physicist, who, won, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, 1923, for, the, measurement, of, the, elementary, electric, charge, and, for, his, work, on, the, photoelectric, effect, millikan, graduated, from, oberlin, college, in, 1891, and, obtained, his, doctorate, at, columbia, university, in, 1895, in, 1896, he, became, an, assistant, at, the, university, of, chicago, where, he, became, a, full, professor, in, 1910, in, 1909, millikan, began, a, series, of, experiments, to, determine, the, electric, charge, carried, by, a, single, electron, he, began, by, measuring, the, course, of, charged, water, droplets, in, an, electric, field, the, results, suggested, that, the, charge, on, the, droplets, is, a, multiple, of, the, elementary, electric, charge, but, the, experiment, was, not, accurate, enough, to, be, convincing, he, obtained, more, precise, results, in, 1910, with, his, oil, drop, experiment, in, which, he, replaced, water, which, tended, to, evaporate, too, quickly, with, oil, in, 1914, millikan, took, up, with, similar, skill, the, experimental, verification, of, the, equation, introduced, by, albert, einstein, in, 1905, to, describe, the, photoelectric, effect, he, used, this, same, research, to, obtain, an, accurate, value, of, the, planck, constant, in, 1921, millikan, left, the, university, of, chicago, to, become, director, of, the, norman, bridge, laboratory, of, physics, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, caltech, in, pasadena, california, there, he, undertook, a, major, study, of, the, radiation, that, the, physicist, victor, hess, had, detected, coming, from, outer, space, millikan, proved, that, this, radiation, is, indeed, of, extraterrestrial, origin, and, he, named, it, cosmic, rays, as, chairman, of, the, executive, council, of, caltech, the, school, s, governing, body, at, the, time, from, 1921, until, his, retirement, in, 1945, millikan, helped, to, turn, the, school, into, one, of, the, leading, research, institutions, in, the, united, states, he, also, served, on, the, board, of, trustees, for, science, service, now, known, as, society, for, science, the, public, from, 1921, to, 1953, millikan, was, an, elected, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, and, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, he, was, elected, an, honorary, member, of, the, optical, society, of, america, in, 1950, robert, andrews, millikan, was, born, on, march, 22, 1868, in, morrison, illinois, he, went, to, high, school, in, maquoketa, iowa, and, received, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, the, classics, from, oberlin, college, in, 1891, and, his, doctorate, in, physics, from, columbia, university, in, 1895, he, was, the, first, to, earn, a, ph, d, from, that, department, at, the, close, of, my, sophomore, year, my, greek, professor, asked, me, to, teach, the, course, in, elementary, physics, in, the, preparatory, department, during, the, next, year, to, my, reply, that, i, did, not, know, any, physics, at, all, his, answer, was, anyone, who, can, do, well, in, my, greek, can, teach, physics, all, right, said, i, you, will, have, to, take, the, consequences, but, i, will, try, and, see, what, i, can, do, with, it, i, at, once, purchased, an, avery, s, elements, of, physics, and, spent, the, greater, part, of, my, summer, vacation, of, 1889, at, home, trying, to, master, the, subject, i, doubt, if, i, have, ever, taught, better, in, my, life, than, in, my, first, course, in, physics, in, 1889, i, was, so, intensely, interested, in, keeping, my, knowledge, ahead, of, that, of, the, class, that, they, may, have, caught, some, of, my, own, interest, and, enthusiasm, millikan, s, enthusiasm, for, education, continued, throughout, his, career, and, he, was, the, coauthor, of, a, popular, and, influential, series, of, introductory, textbooks, which, were, ahead, of, their, time, in, many, ways, compared, to, other, books, of, the, time, they, treated, the, subject, more, in, the, way, in, which, it, was, thought, about, by, physicists, they, also, included, many, homework, problems, that, asked, conceptual, questions, rather, than, simply, requiring, the, student, to, plug, numbers, into, a, formula, starting, in, 1908, while, a, professor, at, the, university, of, chicago, millikan, worked, on, an, oil, drop, experiment, in, which, he, measured, the, charge, on, a, single, electron, j, j, thomson, had, already, discovered, the, charge, to, mass, ratio, of, the, electron, however, the, actual, charge, and, mass, values, were, unknown, therefore, if, one, of, these, two, values, were, to, be, discovered, the, other, could, easily, be, calculated, millikan, and, his, then, graduate, student, harvey, fletcher, used, the, oil, drop, experiment, to, measure, the, charge, of, the, electron, as, well, as, the, electron, mass, and, avogadro, constant, since, their, relation, to, the, electron, charge, was, known, professor, millikan, took, sole, credit, in, return, for, harvey, fletcher, claiming, full, authorship, on, a, related, result, for, his, dissertation, millikan, went, on, to, win, the, 1923, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, part, for, this, work, and, fletcher, kept, the, agreement, a, secret, until, his, death, after, a, publication, on, his, first, results, in, 1910, contradictory, observations, by, felix, ehrenhaft, started, a, controversy, between, the, two, physicists, after, improving, his, setup, millikan, published, his, seminal, study, in, 1913, the, elementary, charge, is, one, of, the, fundamental, physical, constants, and, accurate, knowledge, of, its, value, is, of, great, importance, his, experiment, measured, the, force, on, tiny, charged, droplets, of, oil, suspended, against, gravity, between, two, metal, electrodes, knowing, the, electric, field, the, charge, on, the, droplet, could, be, determined, repeating, the, experiment, for, many, droplets, millikan, showed, that, the, results, could, be, explained, as, integer, multiples, of, a, common, value, 1, 592, 10, 19, coulomb, which, is, the, charge, of, a, single, electron, that, this, is, somewhat, lower, than, the, modern, value, of, 1, 602, 176, 53, 14, x, 10, 19, coulomb, is, probably, due, to, millikan, s, use, of, an, inaccurate, value, for, the, viscosity, of, air, although, at, the, time, of, millikan, s, oil, drop, experiments, it, was, becoming, clear, that, there, exist, such, things, as, subatomic, particles, not, everyone, was, convinced, experimenting, with, cathode, rays, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, had, discovered, negatively, charged, corpuscles, as, he, called, them, with, a, charge, to, mass, ratio, 1840, times, that, of, a, hydrogen, ion, similar, results, had, been, found, by, george, fitzgerald, and, walter, kaufmann, most, of, what, was, then, known, about, electricity, and, magnetism, could, be, explained, on, the, basis, that, charge, is, a, continuous, variable, this, in, much, the, same, way, that, many, of, the, properties, of, light, can, be, explained, by, treating, it, as, a, continuous, wave, rather, than, as, a, stream, of, photons, the, beauty, of, the, oil, drop, experiment, is, that, as, well, as, allowing, quite, accurate, determination, of, the, fundamental, unit, of, charge, millikan, s, apparatus, also, provided, a, hands, on, demonstration, that, charge, is, actually, quantized, general, electric, company, s, charles, steinmetz, who, had, previously, thought, that, charge, is, a, continuous, variable, became, convinced, otherwise, after, working, with, millikan, s, apparatus, there, is, some, controversy, over, selectivity, in, millikan, s, use, of, results, from, his, second, experiment, measuring, the, electron, charge, this, issue, has, been, discussed, by, allan, franklin, a, former, high, energy, experimentalist, and, current, philosopher, of, science, at, the, university, of, colorado, franklin, contends, that, millikan, s, exclusions, of, data, do, not, affect, the, final, value, of, the, charge, obtained, but, that, millikan, s, substantial, cosmetic, surgery, reduced, the, statistical, error, this, enabled, millikan, to, give, the, charge, of, the, electron, to, better, than, one, half, of, one, percent, in, fact, if, millikan, had, included, all, of, the, data, he, discarded, the, error, would, have, been, less, than, 2, while, this, would, still, have, resulted, in, millikan, s, having, measured, the, charge, of, e, better, than, anyone, else, at, the, time, the, slightly, larger, uncertainty, might, have, allowed, more, disagreement, with, his, results, within, the, physics, community, which, millikan, likely, tried, to, avoid, david, goodstein, argues, that, millikan, s, statement, that, all, drops, observed, over, a, 60, day, period, were, used, in, the, paper, was, clarified, in, a, subsequent, sentence, that, specified, all, drops, upon, which, complete, series, of, observations, were, made, goodstein, attests, that, this, is, indeed, the, case, and, notes, that, five, pages, of, tables, separate, the, two, sentences, when, albert, einstein, published, his, 1905, paper, on, the, particle, theory, of, light, millikan, was, convinced, that, it, had, to, be, wrong, because, of, the, vast, body, of, evidence, that, had, already, shown, that, light, was, a, wave, he, undertook, a, decade, long, experimental, program, to, test, einstein, s, theory, which, required, building, what, he, described, as, a, machine, shop, in, vacuo, in, order, to, prepare, the, very, clean, metal, surface, of, the, photoelectrode, his, results, published, in, 1914, confirmed, einstein, s, predictions, in, every, detail, but, millikan, was, not, convinced, of, einstein, s, interpretation, and, as, late, as, 1916, he, wrote, einstein, s, photoelectric, equation, cannot, in, my, judgment, be, looked, upon, at, present, as, resting, upon, any, sort, of, a, satisfactory, theoretical, foundation, even, though, it, actually, represents, very, accurately, the, behavior, of, the, photoelectric, effect, in, his, 1950, autobiography, however, he, declared, that, his, work, scarcely, permits, of, any, other, interpretation, than, that, which, einstein, had, originally, suggested, namely, that, of, the, semi, corpuscular, or, photon, theory, of, light, itself, although, millikan, s, work, formed, some, of, the, basis, for, modern, particle, physics, he, was, conservative, in, his, opinions, about, 20th, century, developments, in, physics, as, in, the, case, of, the, photon, theory, another, example, is, that, his, textbook, as, late, as, the, 1927, version, unambiguously, states, the, existence, of, the, ether, and, mentions, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, only, in, a, noncommittal, note, at, the, end, of, the, caption, under, einstein, s, portrait, stating, as, the, last, in, a, list, of, accomplishments, that, he, was, author, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, in, 1905, and, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, in, 1914, both, of, which, have, had, great, success, in, explaining, otherwise, unexplained, phenomena, and, in, predicting, new, ones, millikan, is, also, credited, with, measuring, the, value, of, the, planck, constant, by, using, photoelectric, emission, graphs, of, various, metals, in, 1917, solar, astronomer, george, ellery, hale, convinced, millikan, to, begin, spending, several, months, each, year, at, the, throop, college, of, technology, a, small, academic, institution, in, pasadena, california, that, hale, wished, to, transform, into, a, major, center, for, scientific, research, and, education, a, few, years, later, throop, college, became, the, california, institute, of, technology, caltech, and, millikan, left, the, university, of, chicago, to, become, caltech, s, chairman, of, the, executive, council, effectively, its, president, millikan, served, in, that, position, from, 1921, to, 1945, at, caltech, most, of, his, scientific, research, focused, on, the, study, of, cosmic, rays, a, term, he, coined, in, the, 1930s, he, entered, into, a, debate, with, arthur, compton, over, whether, cosmic, rays, were, composed, of, high, energy, photons, millikan, s, view, or, charged, particles, compton, s, view, millikan, thought, his, cosmic, ray, photons, were, the, birth, cries, of, new, atoms, continually, being, created, to, counteract, entropy, and, prevent, the, heat, death, of, the, universe, compton, was, eventually, proven, right, by, the, observation, that, cosmic, rays, are, deflected, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, hence, must, be, charged, particles, millikan, was, vice, chairman, of, the, national, research, council, during, world, war, i, during, that, time, he, helped, to, develop, anti, submarine, and, meteorological, devices, during, his, wartime, service, an, investigation, by, inspector, general, william, t, wood, determined, that, millikan, had, attempted, to, steal, another, inventor, s, design, for, a, centrifugal, gun, in, order, to, profit, personally, wood, recommended, termination, of, millikan, s, army, commission, but, a, subsequent, investigation, by, frank, mcintyre, the, executive, assistant, to, the, army, chief, of, staff, exonerated, millikan, he, received, the, chinese, order, of, jade, after, the, war, millikan, contributed, to, the, works, of, the, league, of, nations, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, from, 1922, in, replacement, to, george, e, hale, to, 1931, with, other, prominent, researchers, marie, curie, albert, einstein, hendrik, lorentz, etc, millikan, was, a, member, of, the, organizing, committee, of, the, 1932, los, angeles, olympics, and, in, his, private, life, was, an, enthusiastic, tennis, player, he, was, married, and, had, three, sons, the, eldest, of, whom, clark, b, millikan, became, a, prominent, aerodynamic, engineer, another, son, glenn, also, a, physicist, married, the, daughter, clare, of, george, leigh, mallory, of, because, it, s, there, mount, everest, fame, glenn, was, killed, in, a, climbing, accident, in, cumberland, mountains, in, 1947, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1933, long, beach, earthquake, millikan, chaired, the, joint, technical, committee, on, earthquake, protection, they, authored, a, report, proposing, means, to, minimize, life, and, property, loss, in, future, earthquakes, by, advocating, stricter, building, codes, a, religious, man, and, the, son, of, a, minister, in, his, later, life, millikan, argued, strongly, for, a, complementary, relationship, between, christian, faith, and, science, he, dealt, with, this, in, his, terry, lectures, at, yale, in, 1926, 27, published, as, evolution, in, science, and, religion, he, was, a, christian, theist, and, proponent, of, theistic, evolution, a, more, controversial, belief, of, his, was, eugenics, he, was, one, of, the, initial, trustees, of, the, human, betterment, foundation, and, praised, san, marino, california, for, being, the, westernmost, outpost, of, nordic, civilization, a, population, which, is, twice, as, anglo, saxon, as, that, existing, in, new, york, chicago, or, any, of, the, great, cities, of, this, country, in, 1936, millikan, advised, the, president, of, duke, university, in, the, then, racial, segregated, southern, united, states, against, recruiting, a, female, physicist, and, argued, that, it, would, be, better, to, hire, young, men, on, account, of, millikan, s, affiliation, with, the, human, betterment, foundation, in, january, 2021, the, caltech, board, of, trustees, authorized, removal, of, millikan, s, name, and, the, names, of, five, other, historical, figures, affiliated, with, the, foundation, from, campus, buildings, this, criticism, has, been, rigorously, analyzed, in, 2023, by, mathematician, thomas, c, hales, in, concluding, in, a, reversal, of, caltech, s, claims, this, article, shows, that, all, three, of, caltech, s, scientific, witnesses, against, eugenics, were, actually, pro, eugenic, to, varying, degrees, millikan, s, beliefs, fell, within, acceptable, scientific, norms, of, his, day, his, analysis, further, proposed, to, remedy, the, caltech, s, decision, as, follows, the, following, remedies, are, recommended, president, rosenbaum, and, the, caltech, board, of, trustees, should, rescind, their, endorsement, of, the, cnr, report, the, report, itself, should, be, retracted, for, failing, to, meet, the, minimal, standards, of, accuracy, and, scholarship, that, are, expected, of, official, documents, issued, by, one, of, the, world, s, great, scientific, institutions, caltech, should, restore, robert, andrews, millikan, to, a, place, of, honor, in, 1938, he, wrote, a, short, passage, to, be, placed, in, the, westinghouse, time, capsules, at, this, moment, august, 22, 1938, the, principles, of, representative, ballot, government, such, as, are, represented, by, the, governments, of, the, anglo, saxon, french, and, scandinavian, countries, are, in, deadly, conflict, with, the, principles, of, despotism, which, up, to, two, centuries, ago, had, controlled, the, destiny, of, man, throughout, practically, the, whole, of, recorded, history, if, the, rational, scientific, progressive, principles, win, out, in, this, struggle, there, is, a, possibility, of, a, warless, golden, age, ahead, for, mankind, if, the, reactionary, principles, of, despotism, triumph, now, and, in, the, future, the, future, history, of, mankind, will, repeat, the, sad, story, of, war, and, oppression, as, in, the, past, millikan, died, at, a, pasadena, nursing, home, in, 1953, at, age, 85, and, was, interred, in, the, court, of, honor, at, forest, lawn, memorial, park, cemetery, in, glendale, california, on, january, 26, 1982, he, was, honored, by, the, united, states, postal, service, with, a, 37, great, americans, series, 1980, 2000, postage, stamp, tektronix, named, a, street, on, their, portland, oregon, campus, after, millikan, with, the, millikan, way, max, station, of, portland, s, max, blue, line, named, after, the, street, during, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, several, colleges, named, buildings, physical, features, awards, and, professorships, after, millikan, in, 1958, pomona, college, named, a, science, building, millikan, laboratory, in, honor, of, millikan, after, reviewing, millikan, s, association, with, the, eugenics, movement, the, college, administration, voted, in, october, 2020, to, rename, the, building, as, the, ms, mary, estella, seaver, and, mr, carlton, seaver, laboratory, on, the, caltech, campus, several, physical, features, rooms, awards, and, a, professorship, were, named, in, honor, of, millikan, including, the, millikan, library, which, was, completed, in, 1966, in, january, 2021, the, board, of, trustees, voted, to, immediately, strip, millikan, s, name, from, the, caltech, campus, because, of, his, association, with, eugenics, the, robert, a, millikan, library, has, been, renamed, caltech, hall, in, november, 2021, the, robert, a, millikan, professorship, was, renamed, the, judge, shirley, hufstedler, professorship, in, november, 2020, millikan, middle, school, formerly, millikan, junior, high, school, in, the, suburban, los, angeles, neighborhood, of, sherman, oaks, started, the, process, of, renaming, their, school, in, february, 2022, the, board, of, education, for, the, los, angeles, unified, school, district, voted, unanimously, to, rename, the, school, in, honor, of, musician, louis, armstrong, in, august, 2020, the, long, beach, unified, school, district, established, a, committee, that, would, examine, the, need, for, renaming, of, their, robert, a, millikan, high, school, an, october, 2023, attempt, to, get, the, school, board, to, restart, the, stalled, renaming, process, failed, as, of, august, 2024, long, beach, remains, the, only, city, that, still, has, an, educational, institution, named, in, honor, of, millikan, in, the, spring, of, 2021, the, american, association, of, physics, teachers, voted, unanimously, to, remove, millikan, s, name, from, the, robert, a, millikan, award, which, honors, notable, and, intellectually, creative, contributions, to, the, teaching, of, physics, a, few, months, later, aapt, announced, that, the, award, would, be, renamed, in, honor, of, university, of, washington, professor, of, physics, lillian, c, mcdermott, who, died, the, previous, year, in, 1902, he, married, greta, ervin, blanchard, 1876, 1953, who, pre,
