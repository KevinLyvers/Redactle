reinhardt, with, a, potentially, catastrophic, obstacle, as, he, was, a, romani, jazz, musician, beginning, in, 1933, all, german, romani, were, barred, from, living, in, cities, herded, into, settlement, camps, and, routinely, sterilized, romani, men, were, required, to, wear, a, brown, gypsy, id, triangle, sewn, at, chest, level, on, their, clothing, 168, similar, to, the, pink, triangle, that, homosexuals, wore, and, much, like, the, yellow, star, of, david, that, jews, had, to, subsequently, wear, during, the, war, romani, were, systematically, killed, in, concentration, camps, 169, in, france, they, were, used, as, slave, labour, on, farms, and, in, factories, 169, during, the, holocaust, an, estimated, 600, 000, to, 1, 5, million, romani, throughout, europe, were, killed, 154, hitler, and, joseph, goebbels, viewed, jazz, as, un, german, counterculture, 154, nonetheless, goebbels, stopped, short, of, a, complete, ban, on, jazz, which, now, had, many, fans, in, germany, and, elsewhere, 157, official, policy, towards, jazz, was, much, less, strict, in, occupied, france, according, to, author, andy, fry, with, jazz, music, frequently, played, on, both, radio, france, the, official, station, of, vichy, france, and, radio, paris, which, was, controlled, by, the, germans, a, new, generation, of, french, jazz, enthusiasts, the, zazous, had, arisen, and, swollen, the, ranks, of, the, hot, club, 157, in, addition, to, the, increased, interest, many, american, musicians, based, in, paris, during, the, thirties, had, returned, to, the, us, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, leaving, more, work, for, french, musicians, reinhardt, was, the, most, famous, jazz, musician, in, europe, at, the, time, working, steadily, during, the, early, war, years, and, earning, a, great, deal, of, money, yet, always, under, threat, reinhardt, expanded, his, musical, horizons, during, this, period, using, an, early, amplification, system, he, was, able, to, work, in, more, of, a, big, band, format, in, large, ensembles, with, horn, sections, he, also, experimented, with, classical, composition, writing, a, mass, for, the, gypsies, and, a, symphony, since, he, did, not, read, music, reinhardt, worked, with, an, assistant, to, notate, what, he, was, improvising, his, modernist, piece, rythme, futur, was, also, intended, to, be, acceptable, to, the, nazis, in, this, graceful, and, eloquent, melody, django, evoked, the, woes, of, the, war, that, weighed, on, people, s, souls, and, then, transcended, it, all, biographer, michael, dregni, 93, in, 1943, reinhardt, married, his, long, term, partner, sophie, naguine, ziegler, in, salbris, they, had, a, son, babik, reinhardt, who, became, a, respected, guitarist, at, that, time, the, tide, of, war, turned, against, the, germans, with, a, considerable, darkening, of, the, situation, in, paris, severe, rationing, was, in, place, and, members, of, reinhardt, s, circle, were, being, captured, by, the, nazis, or, joining, the, resistance, reinhardt, s, first, attempt, at, escape, from, occupied, france, led, to, capture, fortunately, for, him, a, jazz, loving, german, luftwaffe, officer, dietrich, schulz, k, hn, allowed, him, to, return, to, paris, reinhardt, made, a, second, attempt, a, few, days, later, but, was, stopped, in, the, middle, of, the, night, by, swiss, border, guards, who, forced, him, to, return, to, paris, again, one, of, his, tunes, 1940, s, nuages, became, an, unofficial, anthem, in, paris, to, signify, hope, for, liberation, 93, during, a, concert, at, the, salle, pleyel, the, popularity, of, the, tune, was, such, that, the, crowd, made, him, replay, it, three, times, in, a, row, 93, the, single, sold, over, 100, 000, copies, 93, after, the, war, reinhardt, rejoined, grappelli, in, the, uk, in, the, autumn, of, 1946, he, made, his, first, tour, in, the, united, states, debuting, at, cleveland, music, hall, as, a, special, guest, soloist, with, duke, ellington, and, his, orchestra, he, played, with, many, musicians, and, composers, such, as, maury, deutsch, at, the, end, of, the, tour, reinhardt, played, two, nights, at, carnegie, hall, in, new, york, city, he, received, a, great, ovation, and, took, six, curtain, calls, on, the, first, night, despite, his, pride, in, touring, with, ellington, one, of, two, letters, to, grappelli, relates, his, excitement, he, was, not, fully, integrated, into, the, band, he, played, a, few, tunes, at, the, end, of, the, show, backed, by, ellington, with, no, special, arrangements, written, for, him, after, the, tour, reinhardt, secured, an, engagement, at, caf, society, uptown, where, he, played, four, solos, a, day, backed, by, the, resident, band, these, performances, drew, large, audiences, 138, 139, having, failed, to, bring, his, usual, selmer, mod, le, jazz, he, played, on, a, borrowed, electric, guitar, which, he, felt, hampered, the, delicacy, of, his, style, 138, he, had, been, promised, jobs, in, california, but, they, failed, to, develop, tired, of, waiting, reinhardt, returned, to, france, in, february, 1947, 141, after, his, return, reinhardt, appeared, to, find, it, difficult, to, adjust, he, sometimes, showed, up, for, scheduled, concerts, without, a, guitar, or, amplifier, or, wandered, off, to, the, park, or, beach, on, a, few, occasions, he, refused, to, get, out, of, bed, reinhardt, developed, a, reputation, among, his, band, fans, and, managers, as, extremely, unreliable, he, skipped, sold, out, concerts, to, walk, to, the, beach, or, smell, the, dew, 145, during, this, period, he, continued, to, attend, the, r, 26, artistic, salon, in, montmartre, improvising, with, his, devoted, collaborator, st, phane, grappelli, in, rome, in, 1949, reinhardt, recruited, three, italian, jazz, players, on, bass, piano, and, snare, drum, and, recorded, over, 60, tunes, in, an, italian, studio, he, united, with, grappelli, and, used, his, acoustic, selmer, maccaferri, the, recording, was, issued, for, the, first, time, in, the, late, 1950s, back, in, paris, in, june, 1950, reinhardt, was, invited, to, join, an, entourage, to, welcome, the, return, of, benny, goodman, he, also, attended, a, reception, for, goodman, who, after, the, war, ended, had, asked, reinhardt, to, join, him, in, the, us, goodman, repeated, his, invitation, and, out, of, politeness, reinhardt, accepted, reinhardt, later, had, second, thoughts, about, what, role, he, could, play, alongside, goodman, who, was, the, king, of, swing, and, remained, in, france, 251, in, 1951, reinhardt, retired, to, samois, sur, seine, near, fontainebleau, where, he, lived, until, his, death, he, continued, to, play, in, paris, jazz, clubs, and, began, playing, electric, guitar, he, often, used, a, selmer, fitted, with, an, electric, pickup, despite, his, initial, hesitation, about, the, instrument, in, his, final, recordings, made, with, his, nouvelle, quintette, in, the, last, few, months, of, his, life, he, had, begun, moving, in, a, new, musical, direction, in, which, he, assimilated, the, vocabulary, of, bebop, and, fused, it, with, his, own, melodic, style, on, 16, may, 1953, while, walking, home, from, fontainebleau, avon, station, after, playing, in, a, paris, club, he, collapsed, outside, his, house, from, a, brain, hemorrhage, 160, it, was, a, saturday, and, it, took, a, full, day, for, a, doctor, to, arrive, 161, reinhardt, was, declared, dead, on, arrival, at, the, hospital, in, fontainebleau, at, the, age, of, 43, reinhardt, developed, his, initial, musical, approach, via, tutoring, by, relatives, and, exposure, to, other, gypsy, guitar, players, of, the, day, then, playing, the, banjo, guitar, alongside, accordionists, in, the, world, of, the, paris, bal, musette, he, played, mainly, with, a, plectrum, for, maximum, volume, and, attack, particularly, in, the, 1920s, early, 30s, when, amplification, in, venues, was, minimal, or, non, existent, although, he, could, also, play, fingerstyle, on, occasion, as, evidenced, by, some, recorded, introductions, and, solos, following, his, accident, in, 1928, in, which, his, left, hand, was, severely, burned, he, was, left, with, the, use, of, only, his, first, two, fingers, as, a, result, he, developed, a, completely, new, left, hand, technique, and, started, performing, on, guitar, accompanying, popular, singers, of, the, day, before, discovering, jazz, and, presenting, his, new, hybrid, style, of, gypsy, approach, plus, jazz, to, the, outside, world, via, the, quintette, du, hot, club, de, france, despite, his, left, hand, handicap, reinhardt, was, able, to, recapture, in, modified, form, and, then, surpass, his, previous, level, of, proficiency, on, the, guitar, by, now, his, main, instrument, not, only, as, a, lead, instrumental, voice, but, also, as, a, driving, and, harmonically, interesting, rhythm, player, his, virtuosity, incorporating, many, gypsy, derived, influences, was, also, matched, with, a, superb, sense, of, melodic, invention, as, well, as, general, musicality, in, terms, of, choice, of, notes, timing, dynamics, and, utilizing, the, maximum, tonal, range, from, an, instrument, previously, thought, of, by, many, critics, as, potentially, limited, in, expression, playing, completely, by, ear, he, could, neither, read, nor, write, music, he, roamed, freely, across, the, full, range, of, the, fretboard, giving, full, flight, to, his, musical, imagination, and, could, play, with, ease, in, any, key, guitarists, particularly, in, britain, and, the, united, states, could, scarcely, believe, what, they, heard, on, the, records, that, the, quintette, was, making, guitarist, gypsy, jazz, enthusiast, and, educator, ian, cruickshank, writes, it, wasn, t, until, 1938, and, the, quintet, s, first, tour, of, england, that, guitarists, were, able, to, witness, django, s, amazing, abilities, his, hugely, innovative, technique, included, on, a, grand, scale, such, unheard, of, devices, as, melodies, played, in, octaves, tremolo, chords, with, shifting, notes, that, sounded, like, whole, horn, sections, a, complete, array, of, natural, and, artificial, harmonics, highly, charged, dissonances, super, fast, chromatic, runs, from, the, open, bass, strings, to, the, highest, notes, on, the, 1st, string, an, unbelievably, flexible, and, driving, right, hand, two, and, three, octave, arpeggios, advanced, and, unconventional, chords, and, a, use, of, the, flattened, fifth, that, predated, be, bop, by, a, decade, add, to, all, this, django, s, staggering, harmonic, and, melodic, concept, huge, sound, pulsating, swing, sense, of, humour, and, sheer, speed, of, execution, and, it, is, little, wonder, that, guitar, players, were, knocked, sideways, upon, their, first, encounter, with, this, full, blown, genius, because, of, his, damaged, left, hand, his, ring, and, pinky, fingers, helped, little, in, his, playing, reinhardt, had, to, modify, both, his, chordal, and, melodic, approach, extensively, for, chords, he, developed, a, novel, system, based, largely, around, 3, note, chords, each, of, which, could, serve, as, the, equivalent, of, several, conventional, chords, in, different, inversions, for, the, treble, notes, he, could, employ, his, ring, and, little, fingers, to, fret, the, relevant, high, strings, even, though, he, could, not, articulate, these, fingers, independently, while, in, some, chords, he, also, employed, his, left, hand, thumb, on, the, lowest, string, within, his, rapid, melodic, runs, he, frequently, incorporated, arpeggios, which, could, be, played, using, two, notes, per, string, played, with, his, two, good, fingers, being, his, index, and, middle, fingers, while, shifting, up, or, down, the, fingerboard, as, opposed, to, the, more, conventional, box, approach, of, moving, across, strings, within, a, single, fretboard, position, location, he, also, produced, some, of, his, characteristic, effects, by, moving, a, fixed, shape, such, as, a, diminished, chord, rapidly, up, and, down, the, fretboard, resulting, in, what, one, writer, has, called, intervallic, cycling, of, melodic, motifs, and, chords, for, an, unsurpassed, insight, into, these, techniques, in, use, interested, persons, should, not, miss, viewing, the, only, known, synchronised, sound, and, vision, footage, of, reinhardt, in, performance, playing, on, an, instrumental, version, of, the, song, j, attendrai, for, the, short, jazz, film, le, jazz, hot, in, 1938, 39, copies, available, on, youtube, and, elsewhere, hugues, panassi, in, his, 1942, book, the, real, jazz, wrote, first, of, all, his, instrumental, technique, is, vastly, superior, to, that, of, all, other, jazz, guitarists, this, technique, permits, him, to, play, with, an, inconceivable, velocity, and, makes, his, instrument, completely, versatile, though, his, virtuosity, is, stupefying, it, is, no, less, so, than, his, creative, invention, in, his, solos, his, melodic, ideas, are, sparkling, and, ravishing, and, their, abundance, scarcely, gives, the, listener, time, to, catch, his, breath, django, s, ability, to, bend, his, guitar, to, the, most, fantastic, audacities, combined, with, his, expressive, inflections, and, vibrato, is, no, less, wonderful, one, feels, an, extraordinary, flame, burning, through, every, note, writing, in, 1945, billy, neil, and, e, gates, stated, that, reinhardt, set, new, standards, by, an, almost, incredible, and, hitherto, unthought, of, technique, his, ideas, have, a, freshness, and, spontaneity, that, are, at, once, fascinating, and, alluring, the, characteristics, of, reinhardt, s, music, are, primarily, emotional, his, relative, association, of, experience, reinforced, by, a, profound, rational, knowledge, of, his, instrument, the, guitar, s, possibilities, and, limitations, his, love, for, music, and, the, expression, of, it, all, are, a, necessary, adjunct, to, the, means, of, expressing, these, emotions, django, style, enthusiast, john, jorgenson, has, been, quoted, as, saying, django, s, guitar, playing, always, has, so, much, personality, in, it, and, seems, to, contain, such, joy, and, feeling, that, it, is, infectious, he, also, pushes, himself, to, the, edge, nearly, all, the, time, and, rides, a, wave, of, inspiration, that, sometimes, gets, dangerous, even, the, few, times, he, does, not, quite, make, his, ideas, flow, out, flawlessly, it, is, still, so, exciting, that, mistakes, don, t, matter, django, s, seemingly, never, ending, bag, of, licks, tricks, and, colors, always, keep, the, song, interesting, and, his, intensity, level, is, rarely, met, by, any, guitarist, django, s, technique, was, not, only, phenomenal, but, it, was, personal, and, unique, to, him, due, to, his, handicap, it, is, very, difficult, to, achieve, the, same, tone, articulation, and, clarity, using, all, 5, left, hand, fingers, it, is, possible, to, get, closer, with, only, 2, fingers, but, again, is, quite, challenging, probably, the, thing, about, this, music, that, makes, it, always, challenging, and, exciting, to, play, is, that, django, raised, the, bar, so, high, that, it, is, like, chasing, genius, to, get, close, to, his, level, of, playing, in, his, later, style, c, 1946, onwards, reinhardt, began, to, incorporate, more, bebop, influences, in, his, compositions, and, improvisations, also, fitting, a, stimer, electric, pickup, to, his, acoustic, guitar, with, the, addition, of, amplification, his, playing, became, more, linear, and, horn, like, with, the, greater, facility, of, the, amplified, instrument, for, longer, sustain, and, to, be, heard, in, quiet, passages, and, in, general, less, reliance, on, his, gypsy, bag, of, tricks, as, developed, for, his, acoustic, guitar, style, also, in, some, of, his, late, recordings, with, a, very, different, supporting, group, context, from, his, classic, pre, war, quintette, sound, these, electric, period, reinhardt, recordings, have, in, general, received, less, popular, re, release, and, critical, analysis, than, his, pre, war, releases, the, latter, also, extending, to, the, period, from, 1940, to, 1945, when, grappelli, was, absent, which, included, some, of, his, most, famous, compositions, such, as, nuages, but, are, also, a, fascinating, area, of, reinhardt, s, work, to, study, and, have, begun, to, be, revived, by, players, such, as, the, rosenberg, trio, with, their, 2010, release, djangologists, and, bir, li, lagr, ne, wayne, jefferies, in, his, article, django, s, forgotten, era, writes, early, in, 1951, armed, with, his, amplified, maccaferri, which, he, used, to, the, very, end, he, put, together, a, new, band, of, the, best, young, modern, musicians, in, paris, including, hubert, fol, an, altoist, in, the, charlie, parker, mould, although, django, was, twenty, years, older, than, the, rest, of, the, band, he, was, completely, in, command, of, the, modern, style, whilst, his, solos, became, less, chordal, and, his, lines, more, christian, like, he, retained, his, originality, i, believe, he, should, be, rated, much, more, highly, as, a, be, bop, guitarist, his, infallible, technique, his, daring, on, the, edge, improvisations, coupled, with, his, vastly, advanced, harmonic, sense, took, him, to, musical, heights, that, christian, and, many, other, bop, musicians, never, came, near, the, live, cuts, from, club, st, germain, in, february, 1951, are, a, revelation, django, is, on, top, form, full, of, new, ideas, that, are, executed, with, amazing, fluidity, cutting, angular, lines, that, always, retain, that, ferocious, swing, reinhardt, s, first, son, lousson, a, k, a, henri, baumgartner, played, jazz, in, a, mostly, bebop, style, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, he, followed, the, romani, lifestyle, and, was, relatively, little, recorded, reinhardt, s, second, son, babik, became, a, guitarist, in, a, more, contemporary, jazz, style, and, recorded, a, number, of, albums, before, his, death, in, 2001, after, reinhardt, died, his, younger, brother, joseph, at, first, swore, to, abandon, music, but, he, was, persuaded, to, perform, and, record, again, joseph, s, son, markus, reinhardt, is, a, violinist, in, the, romani, style, a, third, generation, of, direct, descendants, has, developed, as, musicians, david, reinhardt, reinhardt, s, grandson, by, his, son, babik, leads, his, own, trio, dallas, baumgartner, a, great, grandson, by, lousson, is, a, guitarist, who, travels, with, the, romani, and, keeps, a, low, public, profile, a, distant, relative, violinist, schnuckenack, reinhardt, became, known, in, germany, as, a, performer, of, gypsy, music, and, gypsy, jazz, up, to, his, death, in, 2006, and, assisted, in, keeping, reinhardt, s, legacy, alive, through, the, period, following, django, s, death, reinhardt, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, guitar, players, of, all, time, and, the, first, important, european, jazz, musician, to, make, a, major, contribution, with, jazz, guitar, during, his, career, he, wrote, nearly, 100, songs, according, to, jazz, guitarist, frank, vignola, using, a, selmer, guitar, in, the, mid, 1930s, his, style, took, on, new, volume, and, expressiveness, because, of, his, physical, disability, he, played, mainly, using, his, index, and, middle, fingers, and, invented, a, distinctive, style, of, jazz, guitar, for, about, a, decade, after, reinhardt, s, death, interest, in, his, musical, style, was, minimal, in, the, fifties, bebop, superseded, swing, in, jazz, rock, and, roll, took, off, and, electric, instruments, became, dominant, in, popular, music, since, the, mid, sixties, there, has, been, a, revival, of, interest, in, reinhardt, s, music, a, revival, that, has, extended, into, the, 21st, century, with, annual, festivals, and, periodic, tribute, concerts, his, devotees, included, classical, guitarist, julian, bream, and, country, guitarist, chet, atkins, who, considered, him, one, of, the, ten, greatest, guitarists, of, the, twentieth, century, cover, jazz, guitarists, in, the, u, s, such, as, charlie, byrd, and, wes, montgomery, were, influenced, by, his, style, byrd, who, lived, from, 1925, to, 1999, said, that, reinhardt, was, his, primary, influence, the, rock, musician, mike, peters, noted, that, the, word, genius, is, bantered, about, too, much, but, in, jazz, louis, armstrong, was, a, genius, duke, ellington, was, another, one, and, reinhardt, was, also, david, grisman, added, as, far, as, i, m, concerned, no, one, since, has, come, anywhere, close, to, django, reinhardt, as, an, improviser, or, technician, the, popularity, of, gypsy, jazz, has, generated, an, increasing, number, of, festivals, such, as, the, festival, django, reinhardt, held, every, last, weekend, of, june, since, 1983, in, samois, sur, seine, france, and, since, 2017, in, nearby, fontainebleau, the,

serge, krief, many, guitar, players, and, other, musicians, have, expressed, admiration, for, reinhardt, or, have, cited, him, as, a, major, influence, jeff, beck, described, reinhardt, as, by, far, the, most, astonishing, guitar, player, ever, and, quite, superhuman, jimmy, page, of, led, zeppelin, said, django, reinhardt, was, fantastic, he, must, have, been, playing, all, the, time, to, be,

june, 1985, in, frets, magazine, his, technique, is, awesome, even, today, nobody, has, really, come, to, the, state, that, he, was, playing, at, as, good, as, players, are, they, haven, t, gotten, to, where, he, is, there, s, a, lot, of, guys, that, play, fast, and, a, lot, of, guys, that, play, clean, and, the, guitar, has, come, a, long, way, as, far, as, speed, and, clarity, go, but, nobody, plays, with, the, whole, fullness, of, expression, that, django, has, i, mean, the, combination, of, incredible, speed, all, the, speed, you, could, possibly, want, but, also, the, thing, of, every, note, have, a, specific, personality, you, don, t, hear, it, i, really, haven, t, heard, it, anywhere, but, with, django, django, is, still, one, of, my, main, influences, i, think, for, lyricism, he,

me, a, whole, new, perspective, on, the, guitar, and, on, an, even, more, profound, level, on, my, relationship, with, sound, during, my, formative, years, as, i, listened, to, django, s, records, especially, songs, like, nuages, that, i, would, play, for, the, rest, of, my, life, i, studied, his, technique, even, more, i, studied, his, gentleness, i, love, the, human, sound, he, gave, his,
