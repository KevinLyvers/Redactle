comprehensively, edited, tang, poets, were, affected, by, the, destruction, of, the, imperial, tang, libraries, and, the, loss, of, many, private, collections, in, the, periods, of, turmoil, an, lushan, rebellion, and, huang, chao, rebellion, although, many, of, li, bai, s, poems, have, survived, even, more, were, lost, and, there, is, difficulty, regarding, variant, texts, one, of, the, earliest, endeavors, at, editing, li, bai, s, work, was, by, his, relative, li, yangbing, the, magistrate, of, dangtu, with, whom, he, stayed, in, his, final, years, and, to, whom, he, entrusted, his, manuscripts, however, the, most, reliable, texts, are, not, necessarily, in, the, earliest, editions, song, dynasty, scholars, produced, various, editions, of, his, poetry, but, it, was, not, until, the, qing, dynasty, that, such, collections, as, the, complete, tang, poems, made, the, most, comprehensive, studies, of, the, then, surviving, texts, critics, have, focused, on, li, bai, s, strong, sense, of, the, continuity, of, poetic, tradition, his, glorification, of, alcoholic, beverages, and, indeed, frank, celebration, of, drunkenness, his, use, of, persona, the, fantastic, extremes, of, some, of, his, imagery, his, mastery, of, formal, poetic, rules, and, his, ability, to, combine, all, of, these, with, a, seemingly, effortless, virtuosity, to, produce, inimitable, poetry, other, themes, in, li, s, poetry, noted, especially, in, the, 20th, century, are, sympathy, for, the, common, folk, and, antipathy, towards, needless, wars, even, when, conducted, by, the, emperor, himself, li, bai, had, a, strong, sense, of, himself, as, being, part, of, a, poetic, tradition, the, genius, of, li, bai, says, one, recent, account, lies, at, once, in, his, total, command, of, the, literary, tradition, before, him, and, his, ingenuity, in, bending, without, breaking, it, to, discover, a, uniquely, personal, idiom, burton, watson, comparing, him, to, du, fu, says, li, s, poetry, is, essentially, backward, looking, that, it, represents, more, a, revival, and, fulfillment, of, past, promises, and, glory, than, a, foray, into, the, future, watson, adds, as, evidence, that, of, all, the, poems, attributed, to, li, bai, about, one, sixth, are, in, the, form, of, yuefu, or, in, other, words, reworked, lyrics, from, traditional, folk, ballads, as, further, evidence, watson, cites, the, existence, of, a, fifty, nine, poem, collection, by, li, bai, entitled, gu, feng, or, in, the, old, manner, which, is, in, part, tribute, to, the, poetry, of, the, han, and, wei, dynasties, his, admiration, for, certain, particular, poets, is, also, shown, through, specific, allusions, for, example, to, qu, yuan, or, tao, yuanming, and, occasionally, by, name, for, example, du, fu, a, more, general, appreciation, for, history, is, shown, on, the, part, of, li, bai, in, his, poems, of, the, huaigu, genre, or, meditations, on, the, past, wherein, following, one, of, the, perennial, themes, of, chinese, poetry, the, poet, contemplates, the, ruins, of, past, glory, john, c, h, wu, observed, that, while, some, may, have, drunk, more, wine, than, li, no, one, has, written, more, poems, about, wine, classical, chinese, poets, were, often, associated, with, drinking, wine, and, li, bai, was, part, of, the, group, of, chinese, scholars, in, chang, an, his, fellow, poet, du, fu, called, the, eight, immortals, of, the, wine, cup, the, chinese, generally, did, not, find, the, moderate, use, of, alcohol, to, be, immoral, or, unhealthy, james, j, y, liu, comments, that, zui, in, poetry, does, not, mean, quite, the, same, thing, as, drunk, intoxicated, or, inebriated, but, rather, means, being, mentally, carried, away, from, one, s, normal, preoccupations, liu, translates, zui, as, rapt, with, wine, the, eight, immortals, however, drank, to, an, unusual, degree, though, they, still, were, viewed, as, pleasant, eccentrics, burton, watson, concluded, that, early, all, chinese, poets, celebrate, the, joys, of, wine, but, none, so, tirelessly, and, with, such, a, note, of, genuine, conviction, as, li, the, following, two, poems, rising, drunk, on, a, spring, day, telling, my, intent, and, drinking, alone, by, moonlight, are, among, li, bai, s, most, famous, and, demonstrate, different, aspects, of, his, use, of, wine, and, drunkenness, we, are, lodged, in, this, world, as, in, a, great, dream, then, why, cause, our, lives, so, much, stress, this, is, my, reason, to, spend, the, day, drunk, and, collapse, sprawled, against, the, front, pillar, when, i, wake, i, peer, out, in, the, yard, where, a, bird, is, singing, among, the, flowers, now, tell, me, what, season, is, this, the, spring, breeze, speaks, with, orioles, warbling, i,

beyond, human, cares, and, plan, to, meet, far, in, the, river, of, stars, drinking, alone, by, moonlight, yu, xi, d, zhu, translated, by, stephen, owen, an, important, characteristic, of, li, bai, s, poetry, is, the, fantasy, and, note, of, childlike, wonder, and, playfulness, that, pervade, so, much, of, it, burton, watson, attributes, this, to, a, fascination, with, the, taoist, priest, taoist, recluses, who, practiced, alchemy, and, austerities, in, the, mountains, in, the, aim, of, becoming, xian, or, immortal, beings, there, is, a, strong, element, of, taoism, in, his, works, both, in, the, sentiments, they, express, and, in, their, spontaneous, tone, and, many, of, his, poems, deal, with, mountains, often, descriptions, of, ascents, that, midway, modulate, into, journeys, of, the, imagination, passing, from, actual, mountain, scenery, to, visions, of, nature, deities, immortals, and, jade, maidens, of, taoist, lore, watson, sees, this, as, another, affirmation, of, li, bai, s, affinity, with, the, past, and, a, continuity, with, the, traditions, of, the, chuci, and, the, early, fu, watson, finds, this, element, of, fantasy, to, be, behind, li, bai, s, use, of, hyperbole, and, the, playful, personifications, of, mountains, and, celestial, objects, literary, critic, james, j, y, liu, notes, chinese, poets, seem, to, be, perpetually, bewailing, their, exile, and, longing, to, return, home, this, may, seem, sentimental, to, western, readers, but, one, should, remember, the, vastness, of, china, the, difficulties, of, communication, the, sharp, contrast, between, the, highly, cultured, life, in, the, main, cities, and, the, harsh, conditions, in, the, remoter, regions, of, the, country, and, the, importance, of, family, it, is, hardly, surprising, he, concludes, that, nostalgia, should, have, become, a, constant, and, hence, conventional, theme, in, chinese, poetry, liu, gives, as, a, prime, example, li, s, poem, a, quiet, night, thought, also, translated, as, contemplating, moonlight, which, is, often, learned, by, schoolchildren, in, china, in, a, mere, 20, words, the, poem, uses, the, vivid, moonlight, and, frost, imagery, to, convey, the, feeling, of, homesickness, this, translation, is, by, yang, xianyi, and, dai, naidie, thoughts, in, the, silent, night, j, ngy, s, beside, my, bed, a, pool, of, light, is, it, hoarfrost, on, the, ground, i, lift, my, eyes, and, see, the, moon, i, lower, my, face, and, think, of, home, li, bai, also, wrote, a, number, of, poems, from, various, viewpoints, including, the, personae, of, women, for, example, he, wrote, several, poems, in, the, zi, ye, or, lady, midnight, style, as, well, as, han, folk, ballad, style, poems, li, bai, is, well, known, for, the, technical, virtuosity, of, his, poetry, and, the, mastery, of, his, verses, in, terms, of, poetic, form, critics, generally, agree, that, li, produced, no, significant, innovations, in, theme, and, content, also, his, poetry, is, notable, less, for, the, new, elements, it, introduces, than, for, the, skill, with, which, he, brightens, the, old, ones, burton, watson, comments, on, li, bai, s, famous, poem, which, he, translates, bring, the, wine, like, so, much, of, li, s, work, it, has, a, grace, and, effortless, dignity, that, somehow, make, it, more, compelling, than, earlier, treatment, of, the, same, li, bai, s, yuefu, poems, have, been, called, the, greatest, of, all, time, by, ming, dynasty, scholar, and, writer, hu, yinglin, li, bai, especially, excelled, in, the, gushi, form, or, old, style, poems, a, type, of, poetry, allowing, a, great, deal, of, freedom, in, terms, of, the, form, and, content, of, the, work, an, example, is, his, poem, translated, by, witter, bynner, as, hard, roads, in, shu, shu, is, a, poetic, term, for, sichuan, the, destination, of, refuge, that, emperor, xuanzong, considered, fleeing, to, escape, the, approaching, forces, of, the, rebel, general, an, lushan, watson, comments, that, this, poem, employs, lines, that, range, in, length, from, four, to, eleven, characters, the, form, of, the, lines, suggesting, by, their, irregularity, the, jagged, peaks, and, bumpy, mountain, roads, of, sichuan, depicted, in, the, poem, li, bai, was, also, noted, as, a, master, of, the, jueju, or, cut, verse, ming, dynasty, poet, li, pan, long, thought, li, bai, was, the, greatest, jueju, master, of, the, tang, dynasty, li, bai, was, noted, for, his, mastery, of, the, l, shi, or, regulated, verse, the, formally, most, demanding, verse, form, of, the, times, watson, notes, however, that, his, poem, seeing, a, friend, off, was, unusual, in, that, it, violates, the, rule, that, the, two, middle, couplets, must, observe, verbal, parallelism, adding, that, chinese, critics, excused, this, kind, of, violation, in, the, case, of, a, genius, like, li, li, bai, s, poetry, was, immensely, influential, in, his, own, time, as, well, as, for, subsequent, generations, in, china, from, early, on, he, was, paired, with, du, fu, the, recent, scholar, paula, varsano, observes, that, in, the, literary, imagination, they, were, and, remain, the, two, greatest, poets, of, the, tang, or, even, of, china, yet, she, notes, the, persistence, of, what, we, can, rightly, call, the, li, du, debate, the, terms, of, which, became, so, deeply, ingrained, in, the, critical, discourse, surrounding, these, two, poets, that, almost, any, characterization, of, the, one, implicitly, critiqued, the, other, li, s, influence, has, also, been, demonstrated, in, the, immediate, geographical, area, of, chinese, cultural, influence, being, known, as, ri, haku, in, japan, this, influence, continues, even, today, examples, range, from, poetry, to, painting, and, to, literature, in, his, own, lifetime, during, his, many, wanderings, and, while, he, was, attending, court, in, chang, an, li, bai, met, and, parted, from, various, contemporary, poets, these, meetings, and, separations, were, typical, occasions, for, versification, in, the, tradition, of, the, literate, chinese, of, the, time, a, prime, example, being, his, relationship, with, du, fu, after, his, lifetime, li, bai, s, influence, continued, to, grow, some, four, centuries, later, during, the, song, dynasty, for, example, just, in, the, case, of, his, poem, that, is, sometimes, translated, drinking, alone, beneath, the, moon, the, poet, yang, wanli, wrote, a, whole, poem, alluding, to, it, and, to, two, other, li, bai, poems, in, the, same, gushi, or, old, style, poetry, form, in, the, 20th, century, li, bai, even, influenced, the, poetry, of, mao, zedong, in, china, his, poem, quiet, night, thoughts, reflecting, a, nostalgia, of, a, traveller, away, from, home, has, been, widely, memorized, by, school, children, and, quoted, by, adults, he, is, sometimes, worshipped, as, an, immortal, in, chinese, folk, religion, and, is, also, considered, a, divinity, in, vietnam, cao, dai,
