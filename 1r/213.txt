euripides, c, 480, c, 406, bc, was, a, tragedian, of, classical, athens, along, with, aeschylus, and, sophocles, he, is, one, of, the, three, ancient, greek, tragedians, for, whom, any, plays, have, survived, in, full, some, ancient, scholars, attributed, ninety, five, plays, to, him, but, the, suda, says, it, was, ninety, two, at, most, of, these, eighteen, or, nineteen, have, survived, more, or, less, complete, rhesus, is, suspect, there, are, many, fragments, some, substantial, of, most, of, his, other, plays, more, of, his, plays, have, survived, intact, than, those, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, together, partly, because, his, popularity, grew, as, theirs, declined, he, became, in, the, hellenistic, age, a, cornerstone, of, ancient, literary, education, along, with, homer, demosthenes, and, menander, euripides, is, identified, with, theatrical, innovations, that, have, profoundly, influenced, drama, down, to, modern, times, especially, in, the, representation, of, traditional, mythical, heroes, as, ordinary, people, in, extraordinary, circumstances, this, new, approach, led, him, to, pioneer, developments, that, later, writers, adapted, to, comedy, some, of, which, are, characteristic, of, romance, he, also, became, the, most, tragic, of, poets, focusing, on, the, inner, lives, and, motives, of, his, characters, in, a, way, previously, unknown, he, was, the, creator, of, that, cage, which, is, the, theatre, of, shakespeare, s, othello, racine, s, ph, dre, of, ibsen, and, strindberg, in, which, imprisoned, men, and, women, destroy, each, other, by, the, intensity, of, their, loves, and, hates, but, he, was, also, the, literary, ancestor, of, comic, dramatists, as, diverse, as, menander, and, george, bernard, shaw, his, contemporaries, associated, him, with, socrates, as, a, leader, of, a, decadent, intellectualism, both, were, frequently, lampooned, by, comic, poets, such, as, aristophanes, socrates, was, eventually, put, on, trial, and, executed, as, a, corrupting, influence, ancient, biographies, hold, that, euripides, chose, a, voluntary, exile, in, old, age, dying, in, macedonia, but, recent, scholarship, casts, doubt, on, these, sources, traditional, accounts, of, the, author, s, life, are, found, in, many, commentaries, and, include, details, such, as, these, he, was, born, on, salamis, island, around, 480, bc, with, parents, cleito, mother, and, mnesarchus, father, a, retailer, from, the, deme, of, phlya, on, receiving, an, oracle, that, his, son, was, fated, to, win, crowns, of, victory, mnesarchus, insisted, that, the, boy, should, train, for, a, career, in, athletics, but, the, boy, was, destined, for, a, career, on, the, stage, where, he, was, to, win, only, five, victories, one, of, these, posthumously, he, served, for, a, short, time, as, both, dancer, and, torch, bearer, at, the, rites, of, apollo, zosterius, his, education, was, not, confined, to, athletics, studying, also, painting, and, philosophy, under, the, masters, prodicus, and, anaxagoras, he, had, two, disastrous, marriages, and, both, his, wives, melite, and, choerine, the, latter, bearing, him, three, sons, were, unfaithful, he, became, a, recluse, making, a, home, for, himself, in, a, cave, on, salamis, the, cave, of, euripides, where, a, cult, of, the, playwright, developed, after, his, death, there, he, built, an, impressive, library, and, pursued, daily, communion, with, the, sea, and, sky, the, details, of, his, death, are, uncertain, it, was, traditionally, held, that, he, retired, to, the, rustic, court, of, king, archelaus, in, macedonia, where, he, died, in, 406, bc, some, modern, scholars, however, claim, that, in, reality, euripides, may, have, never, visited, macedonia, at, all, or, if, he, did, he, might, have, been, drawn, there, by, king, archelaus, with, incentives, that, were, also, offered, to, other, artists, such, biographical, details, derive, almost, entirely, from, three, unreliable, sources, the, next, three, sections, expand, on, the, claims, of, each, of, these, sources, respectively, euripides, was, the, youngest, in, a, group, of, three, great, tragedians, who, were, almost, contemporaries, his, first, play, was, staged, thirteen, years, after, sophocles, debut, and, three, years, after, aeschylus, s, oresteia, the, identity, of, the, trio, is, neatly, underscored, by, a, patriotic, account, of, their, roles, during, greece, s, great, victory, over, persia, at, the, battle, of, salamis, aeschylus, fought, there, sophocles, was, just, old, enough, to, celebrate, the, victory, in, a, boys, chorus, and, euripides, was, born, on, the, very, day, of, the, battle, the, apocryphal, account, that, he, composed, his, works, in, a, cave, on, salamis, island, was, a, late, tradition, probably, symbolizing, the, isolation, of, an, intellectual, ahead, of, his, time, much, of, his, life, and, his, whole, career, coincided, with, the, struggle, between, athens, and, sparta, for, hegemony, in, greece, but, he, did, not, live, to, see, the, final, defeat, of, his, city, it, is, said, that, he, died, in, macedonia, after, being, attacked, by, the, molossian, hounds, of, king, archelaus, and, that, his, cenotaph, near, piraeus, was, struck, by, lightning, signs, of, his, unique, powers, whether, for, good, or, ill, according, to, one, modern, scholar, his, death, might, have, been, caused, instead, by, the, harsh, macedonian, winter, in, an, account, by, plutarch, the, catastrophic, failure, of, the, sicilian, expedition, led, athenians, to, trade, renditions, of, euripides, lyrics, to, their, enemies, in, return, for, food, and, drink, life, of, nicias, 29, plutarch, also, provides, the, story, that, the, victorious, spartan, generals, having, planned, the, demolition, of, athens, and, the, enslavement, of, its, people, grew, merciful, after, being, entertained, at, a, banquet, by, lyrics, from, euripides, play, electra, they, felt, that, it, would, be, a, barbarous, act, to, annihilate, a, city, which, produced, such, men, life, of, lysander, tragic, poets, were, often, mocked, by, comic, poets, during, the, dramatic, festivals, dionysia, and, lenaia, and, euripides, was, travestied, more, than, most, aristophanes, scripted, him, as, a, character, in, at, least, three, plays, the, acharnians, thesmophoriazusae, and, the, frogs, but, aristophanes, also, borrowed, rather, than, merely, satirized, some, of, the, tragedian, s, methods, he, was, himself, ridiculed, by, cratinus, another, comic, poet, as, a, quibbler, of, words, a, maker, of, maxims, a, euripidaristophaniser, according, to, another, comic, poet, teleclides, the, plays, of, euripides, were, co, authored, by, the, philosopher, socrates, mnesilochus, is, the, man, who, is, roasting, a, new, play, for, euripides, and, socrates, is, laying, down, the, kindling, euripides, bolted, together, with, socrates, aristophanes, alleged, that, the, co, author, was, a, celebrated, actor, cephisophon, who, also, shared, the, tragedian, s, house, and, his, wife, while, socrates, taught, an, entire, school, of, quibblers, like, euripides, so, what, s, stylish, is, not, to, sit, beside, socrates, and, chatter, casting, the, arts, aside, and, ignoring, the, best, of, the, tragedian, s, craft, to, hang, around, killing, time, in, pretentious, conversation, and, hairsplitting, twaddle, is, the, mark, of, a, man, who, s, lost, his, mind, in, the, frogs, written, when, euripides, and, aeschylus, were, dead, aristophanes, has, the, god, dionysus, venturing, down, to, hades, in, search, of, a, good, poet, to, bring, back, to, athens, after, a, debate, between, the, shades, of, aeschylus, and, euripides, the, god, brings, aeschylus, back, to, life, as, more, useful, to, athens, for, his, wisdom, rejecting, euripides, as, merely, clever, such, comic, evidence, suggests, that, athenians, admired, euripides, even, while, they, mistrusted, his, intellectualism, at, least, during, the, long, war, with, sparta, aeschylus, had, written, his, own, epitaph, commemorating, his, life, as, a, warrior, fighting, for, athens, against, persia, without, any, mention, of, his, success, as, a, playwright, and, sophocles, was, celebrated, by, his, contemporaries, for, his, social, gifts, and, contributions, to, public, life, as, a, state, official, but, there, are, no, records, of, euripides, public, life, except, as, a, dramatist, he, could, well, have, been, a, brooding, and, bookish, recluse, he, is, presented, as, such, in, the, acharnians, where, aristophanes, shows, him, to, be, living, morosely, in, a, precarious, house, surrounded, by, the, tattered, costumes, of, his, disreputable, characters, and, yet, agathon, another, tragic, poet, is, discovered, in, a, later, play, thesmophoriazusae, to, be, living, in, circumstances, almost, as, bizarre, euripides, mother, was, a, humble, vendor, of, vegetables, according, to, the, comic, tradition, yet, his, plays, indicate, that, he, had, a, liberal, education, and, hence, a, privileged, background, euripides, first, competed, in, the, city, dionysia, the, famous, athenian, dramatic, festival, in, 455, bc, one, year, after, the, death, of, aeschylus, and, did, not, win, first, prize, until, 441, bc, his, final, competition, in, athens, was, in, 408, bc, the, bacchae, and, iphigenia, in, aulis, were, performed, in, 405, bc, and, first, prize, was, awarded, posthumously, he, won, first, prize, only, five, times, his, plays, and, those, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, indicate, a, difference, in, outlook, between, the, three, a, generation, gap, probably, due, to, the, sophistic, enlightenment, in, the, middle, decades, of, the, 5th, century, aeschylus, still, looked, back, to, the, archaic, period, sophocles, was, in, transition, between, periods, and, euripides, was, fully, imbued, with, the, new, spirit, of, the, classical, age, when, euripides, plays, are, sequenced, in, time, they, also, reveal, that, his, outlook, might, have, changed, providing, a, spiritual, biography, along, these, lines, however, about, 80, of, his, plays, have, been, lost, and, even, the, extant, plays, do, not, present, a, fully, consistent, picture, of, his, spiritual, development, for, example, iphigenia, in, aulis, is, dated, with, the, despairing, bacchae, yet, it, contains, elements, that, became, typical, of, new, comedy, in, the, bacchae, he, restores, the, chorus, and, messenger, speech, to, their, traditional, role, in, the, tragic, plot, and, the, play, appears, to, be, the, culmination, of, a, regressive, or, archaizing, tendency, in, his, later, works, for, which, see, chronology, below, believed, to, have, been, composed, in, the, wilds, of, macedonia, bacchae, also, dramatizes, a, primitive, side, to, greek, religion, and, some, modern, scholars, have, interpreted, this, particular, play, biographically, therefore, as, one, of, his, earliest, extant, plays, medea, includes, a, speech, that, he, seems, to, have, written, in, defence, of, himself, as, an, intellectual, ahead, of, his, time, spoken, by, medea, if, you, bring, novel, wisdom, to, fools, you, will, be, regarded, as, useless, not, wise, and, if, the, city, regards, you, as, greater, than, those, with, a, reputation, for, cleverness, you, will, be, thought, vexatious, i, myself, am, a, sharer, in, this, lot, athenian, tragedy, in, performance, during, euripides, lifetime, was, a, public, contest, between, playwrights, the, state, funded, it, and, awarded, prizes, the, language, was, metrical, spoken, and, sung, the, performance, area, included, a, circular, floor, called, orchestra, where, the, chorus, could, dance, a, space, for, actors, three, speaking, actors, in, euripides, time, a, backdrop, or, skene, and, some, special, effects, an, ekkyklema, used, to, bring, the, skene, s, indoors, outdoors, and, a, mechane, used, to, lift, actors, in, the, air, as, in, deus, ex, machina, with, the, introduction, of, the, third, actor, attributed, to, aeschylus, by, themistius, to, sophocles, by, aristotle, acting, also, began, to, be, regarded, as, a, skill, worth, prizes, requiring, a, long, apprenticeship, in, the, chorus, euripides, and, other, playwrights, accordingly, composed, more, and, more, arias, for, accomplished, actors, to, sing, and, this, tendency, became, more, marked, in, his, later, plays, tragedy, was, a, living, and, ever, changing, genre, cf, previous, section, and, chronology, a, list, of, his, plays, is, below, the, comic, poet, aristophanes, is, the, earliest, known, critic, to, characterize, euripides, as, a, spokesman, for, destructive, new, ideas, associated, with, declining, standards, in, both, society, and, tragedy, see, reception, for, more, but, fifth, century, tragedy, was, a, social, gathering, for, carrying, out, quite, publicly, the, maintenance, and, development, of, mental, infrastructure, and, it, offered, spectators, a, platform, for, an, utterly, unique, form, of, institutionalized, discussion, the, dramatist, s, role, was, not, only, to, entertain, but, also, educate, fellow, citizens, he, was, expected, to, have, a, message, traditional, myth, provided, the, subject, matter, but, the, dramatist, was, meant, to, be, innovative, which, led, to, novel, characterizations, of, heroic, figures, and, use, of, the, mythical, past, as, a, tool, for, discussing, present, issues, the, difference, between, euripides, and, his, older, colleagues, was, one, of, degree, his, characters, talked, about, the, present, more, controversially, and, pointedly, than, those, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, sometimes, even, challenging, the, democratic, order, thus, for, example, odysseus, is, represented, in, hecuba, lines, 131, 32, as, agile, minded, sweet, talking, demos, pleasing, i, e, similar, to, the, war, time, demagogues, that, were, active, in, athens, during, the, peloponnesian, war, speakers, in, the, plays, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, sometimes, distinguish, between, slaves, who, are, servile, by, nature, and, those, servile, by, circumstance, but, euripides, speakers, go, further, positing, an, individual, s, mental, rather, than, social, or, physical, state, as, a, true, indication, of, worth, for, example, in, hippolytus, a, love, sick, queen, rationalizes, her, position, and, reflecting, on, adultery, arrives, at, this, comment, on, intrinsic, merit, this, contagion, began, for, the, female, sex, with, the, nobility, for, when, those, of, noble, station, resolve, on, base, acts, surely, the, base, born, will, regard, such, acts, as, good, one, thing, only, they, say, competes, in, value, with, life, the, possession, of, a, heart, blameless, and, good, euripides, characters, resembled, contemporary, athenians, rather, than, heroic, figures, of, myth, for, achieving, his, end, euripides, regular, strategy, is, a, very, simple, one, retaining, the, old, stories, and, the, great, names, as, his, theatre, required, he, imagines, his, people, as, contemporaries, subjected, to, contemporary, kinds, of, pressures, and, examines, their, motivations, conduct, and, fate, in, the, light, of, contemporary, problems, usages, and, ideals, as, mouthpieces, for, contemporary, issues, they, all, seem, to, have, had, at, least, an, elementary, course, in, public, speaking, the, dialogue, often, contrasts, so, strongly, with, the, mythical, and, heroic, setting, that, it, can, seem, like, euripides, aimed, at, parody, for, example, in, the, trojan, women, the, heroine, s, rationalized, prayer, elicits, comment, from, menelaus, hecuba, zeus, whether, you, are, the, necessity, of, nature, or, the, mind, of, mortal, men, i, address, you, in, prayer, for, proceeding, on, a, silent, path, you, direct, all, mortal, affairs, toward, justice, menelaus, what, does, this, mean, how, strange, your, prayer, to, the, gods, is, athenian, citizens, were, familiar, with, rhetoric, in, the, assembly, and, law, courts, and, some, scholars, believe, that, euripides, was, more, interested, in, his, characters, as, speakers, with, cases, to, argue, than, as, characters, with, lifelike, personalities, they, are, self, conscious, about, speaking, formally, and, their, rhetoric, is, shown, to, be, flawed, as, if, euripides, were, exploring, the, problematical, nature, of, language, and, communication, for, speech, points, in, three, different, directions, at, once, to, the, speaker, to, the, person, addressed, to, the, features, in, the, world, it, describes, and, each, of, these, directions, can, be, felt, as, skewed, for, example, in, the, quotation, above, hecuba, presents, herself, as, a, sophisticated, intellectual, describing, a, rationalized, cosmos, but, the, speech, is, ill, suited, to, her, audience, the, unsophisticated, listener, menelaus, and, is, found, to, not, suit, the, cosmos, either, her, grandson, is, murdered, by, the, greeks, in, hippolytus, speeches, appear, verbose, and, ungainly, as, if, to, underscore, the, limitations, of, language, like, euripides, both, aeschylus, and, sophocles, created, comic, effects, contrasting, the, heroic, with, the, mundane, but, they, employed, minor, supporting, characters, for, that, purpose, euripides, was, more, insistent, using, major, characters, as, well, his, comic, touches, can, be, thought, to, intensify, the, overall, tragic, effect, and, his, realism, which, often, threatens, to, make, his, heroes, look, ridiculous, marks, a, world, of, debased, heroism, the, loss, of, intellectual, and, moral, substance, becomes, a, central, tragic, statement, psychological, reversals, are, common, and, sometimes, happen, so, suddenly, that, inconsistency, in, characterization, is, an, issue, for, many, critics, such, as, aristotle, who, cited, iphigenia, in, aulis, as, an, example, poetics, 1454a32, for, others, psychological, inconsistency, is, not, a, stumbling, block, to, good, drama, euripides, is, in, pursuit, of, a, larger, insight, he, aims, to, set, forth, the, two, modes, emotional, and, rational, with, which, human, beings, confront, their, own, mortality, some, think, unpredictable, behaviour, realistic, in, tragedy, everywhere, in, euripides, a, preoccupation, with, individual, psychology, and, its, irrational, aspects, is, evident, in, his, hands, tragedy, for, the, first, time, probed, the, inner, recesses, of, the, human, soul, and, let, passions, spin, the, plot, the, tension, between, reason, and, passion, is, symbolized, by, his, characters, relationship, with, the, gods, for, example, hecuba, s, prayer, is, answered, not, by, zeus, nor, by, the, law, of, reason, but, by, menelaus, as, if, speaking, for, the, old, gods, and, the, perhaps, most, famous, example, is, in, bacchae, where, the, god, dionysus, savages, his, own, converts, when, the, gods, do, appear, in, eight, of, the, extant, plays, they, appear, lifeless, and, mechanical, sometimes, condemned, by, critics, as, an, unimaginative, way, to, end, a, story, the, spectacle, of, a, god, making, a, judgement, or, announcement, from, a, theatrical, crane, might, actually, have, been, intended, to, provoke, scepticism, about, the, religious, and, heroic, dimension, of, his, plays, similarly, his, plays, often, begin, in, a, banal, manner, that, undermines, theatrical, illusion, unlike, sophocles, who, established, the, setting, and, background, of, his, plays, in, the, introductory, dialogue, euripides, used, a, monologue, in, which, a, divinity, or, human, character, simply, tells, the, audience, all, it, needs, to, know, to, understand, what, follows, aeschylus, and, sophocles, were, innovative, but, euripides, had, arrived, at, a, position, in, the, ever, changing, genre, where, he, could, easily, move, between, tragic, comic, romantic, and, political, effects, this, versatility, appears, in, individual, plays, and, also, over, the, course, of, his, career, potential, for, comedy, lay, in, his, use, of, contemporary, characters, in, his, sophisticated, tone, his, relatively, informal, greek, see, in, greek, below, and, in, his, ingenious, use, of, plots, centred, on, motifs, that, later, became, standard, in, menander, s, new, comedy, for, example, the, recognition, scene, other, tragedians, also, used, recognition, scenes, but, they, were, heroic, in, emphasis, as, in, aeschylus, s, the, libation, bearers, which, euripides, parodied, in, electra, euripides, was, unique, among, the, tragedians, in, incorporating, theatrical, criticism, in, his, plays, traditional, myth, with, its, exotic, settings, heroic, adventures, and, epic, battles, offered, potential, for, romantic, melodrama, as, well, as, for, political, comments, on, a, war, theme, so, that, his, plays, are, an, extraordinary, mix, of, elements, the, trojan, women, for, example, is, a, powerfully, disturbing, play, on, the, theme, of, war, s, horrors, apparently, critical, of, athenian, imperialism, it, was, composed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, melian, massacre, and, during, the, preparations, for, the, sicilian, expedition, yet, it, features, the, comic, exchange, between, menelaus, and, hecuba, quoted, above, and, the, chorus, considers, athens, the, blessed, land, of, theus, to, be, a, desirable, refuge, such, complexity, and, ambiguity, are, typical, both, of, his, patriotic, and, anti, war, plays, tragic, poets, in, the, fifth, century, competed, against, one, another, at, the, city, dionysia, each, with, a, tetralogy, of, three, tragedies, and, a, satyr, play, the, few, extant, fragments, of, satyr, plays, attributed, to, aeschylus, and, sophocles, indicate, that, these, were, a, loosely, structured, simple, and, jovial, form, of, entertainment, but, in, cyclops, the, only, complete, satyr, play, that, survives, euripides, structured, the, entertainment, more, like, a, tragedy, and, introduced, a, note, of, critical, irony, typical, of, his, other, work, his, genre, bending, inventiveness, is, shown, above, all, in, alcestis, a, blend, of, tragic, and, satyric, elements, this, fourth, play, in, his, tetralogy, for, 438, bc, i, e, it, occupied, the, position, conventionally, reserved, for, satyr, plays, is, a, tragedy, featuring, heracles, as, a, satyric, hero, in, conventional, satyr, play, scenes, an, arrival, a, banquet, a, victory, over, an, ogre, in, this, case, death, a, happy, ending, a, feast, and, a, departure, for, new, adventures, most, of, the, big, innovations, in, tragedy, were, made, by, aeschylus, and, sophocles, but, euripides, made, innovations, on, a, smaller, scale, that, have, impressed, some, critics, as, cumulatively, leading, to, a, radical, change, of, direction, euripides, is, also, known, for, his, use, of, irony, many, greek, tragedians, make, use, of, dramatic, irony, to, bring, out, the, emotion, and, realism, of, their, characters, or, plays, but, euripides, uses, irony, to, foreshadow, events, and, occasionally, amuse, his, audience, for, example, in, his, play, heracles, heracles, comments, that, all, men, love, their, children, and, wish, to, see, them, grow, the, irony, here, is, that, heracles, will, be, driven, into, madness, by, hera, and, will, kill, his, children, similarly, in, helen, theoclymenus, remarks, how, happy, he, is, that, his, sister, has, the, gift, of, prophecy, and, will, warn, him, of, any, plots, or, tricks, against, him, the, audience, already, knows, that, she, has, betrayed, him, in, this, instance, euripides, uses, irony, not, only, for, foreshadowing, but, also, for, comic, effect, which, few, tragedians, did, likewise, in, the, bacchae, pentheus, s, first, threat, to, the, god, dionysus, is, that, if, pentheus, catches, him, in, his, city, he, will, chop, off, his, head, whereas, it, is, pentheus, who, is, beheaded, at, the, end, of, the, play, the, spoken, language, of, the, euripidean, plays, is, not, fundamentally, different, in, style, from, that, of, aeschylus, or, sophocles, it, employs, poetic, meters, a, rarefied, vocabulary, fullness, of, expression, complex, syntax, and, ornamental, figures, all, aimed, at, representing, an, elevated, style, but, its, rhythms, are, somewhat, freer, and, more, natural, than, that, of, his, predecessors, and, the, vocabulary, has, been, expanded, to, allow, for, intellectual, and, psychological, subtleties, euripides, has, been, hailed, as, a, great, lyric, poet, in, medea, for, example, he, composed, for, his, city, athens, the, noblest, of, her, songs, of, praise, his, lyrical, skills, are, not, just, confined, to, individual, poems, a, play, of, euripides, is, a, musical, whole, one, song, echoes, motifs, from, the, preceding, song, while, introducing, new, ones, for, some, critics, the, lyrics, often, seem, dislocated, from, the, action, but, the, extent, and, significance, of, this, is, a, matter, of, scholarly, debate, see, chronology, for, details, about, his, style, euripides, has, aroused, and, continues, to, arouse, strong, opinions, for, and, against, his, work, he, was, a, problem, to, his, contemporaries, and, he, is, one, still, over, the, course, of, centuries, since, his, plays, were, first, produced, he, has, been, hailed, or, indicted, under, a, bewildering, variety, of, labels, he, has, been, described, as, the, poet, of, the, greek, enlightenment, and, also, as, euripides, the, irrationalist, as, a, religious, sceptic, if, not, an, atheist, but, on, the, other, hand, as, a, believer, in, divine, providence, and, the, ultimate, justice, of, divine, dispensation, he, has, been, seen, as, a, profound, explorer, of, human, psychology, and, also, a, rhetorical, poet, who, subordinated, consistency, of, character, to, verbal, effect, as, a, misogynist, and, a, feminist, as, a, realist, who, brought, tragic, action, down, to, the, level, of, everyday, life, and, as, a, romantic, poet, who, chose, unusual, myths, and, exotic, settings, he, wrote, plays, which, have, been, widely, understood, as, patriotic, pieces, supporting, athens, war, against, sparta, and, others, which, many, have, taken, as, the, work, of, the, anti, war, dramatist, par, excellence, even, as, attacks, on, athenian, imperialism, he, has, been, recognized, as, the, precursor, of, new, comedy, and, also, what, aristotle, called, him, the, most, tragic, of, poets, poetics, 1453a30, and, not, one, of, these, descriptions, is, entirely, false, bernard, knox, aeschylus, gained, thirteen, victories, as, a, dramatist, sophocles, at, least, twenty, euripides, only, four, in, his, lifetime, and, this, has, often, been, taken, as, indication, of, the, latter, s, unpopularity, but, a, first, place, might, not, have, been, the, main, criterion, for, success, the, system, of, selecting, judges, appears, to, have, been, flawed, and, merely, being, chosen, to, compete, was, a, mark, of, distinction, moreover, to, have, been, singled, out, by, aristophanes, for, so, much, comic, attention, is, proof, of, popular, interest, in, his, work, sophocles, was, appreciative, enough, of, the, younger, poet, to, be, influenced, by, him, as, is, evident, in, his, later, plays, philoctetes, and, oedipus, at, colonus, according, to, plutarch, euripides, had, been, very, well, received, in, sicily, to, the, extent, that, after, the, failure, of, the, sicilian, expedition, many, athenian, captives, were, released, simply, for, being, able, to, teach, their, captors, whatever, fragments, they, could, remember, of, his, work, less, than, a, hundred, years, later, aristotle, developed, an, almost, biological, theory, of, the, development, of, tragedy, in, athens, the, art, form, grew, under, the, influence, of, aeschylus, matured, in, the, hands, of, sophocles, then, began, its, precipitous, decline, with, euripides, however, his, plays, continued, to, be, applauded, even, after, those, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, had, come, to, seem, remote, and, irrelevant, they, became, school, classics, in, the, hellenistic, period, as, mentioned, in, the, introduction, and, due, to, seneca, s, adaptation, of, his, work, for, roman, audiences, it, was, euripides, not, aeschylus, or, sophocles, whose, tragic, muse, presided, over, the, rebirth, of, tragedy, in, renaissance, europe, in, the, seventeenth, century, racine, expressed, admiration, for, sophocles, but, was, more, influenced, by, euripides, iphigenia, in, aulis, and, hippolytus, were, the, models, for, his, plays, iphig, nie, and, ph, dre, euripides, reputation, was, to, take, a, beating, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, friedrich, schlegel, and, his, brother, august, wilhelm, schlegel, championed, aristotle, s, biological, model, of, theatre, history, identifying, euripides, with, the, moral, political, and, artistic, degeneration, of, athens, august, wilhelm, s, vienna, lectures, on, dramatic, art, and, literature, went, through, four, editions, between, 1809, and, 1846, and, in, them, he, opined, that, euripides, not, only, destroyed, the, external, order, of, tragedy, but, missed, its, entire, meaning, this, view, influenced, friedrich, nietzsche, who, seems, however, not, to, have, known, the, euripidean, plays, well, but, literary, figures, such, as, the, poet, robert, browning, and, his, wife, elizabeth, barrett, browning, could, study, and, admire, the, schlegels, while, still, appreciating, euripides, as, our, euripides, the, human, wine, of, cyprus, stanza, 12, classicists, such, as, arthur, verrall, and, ulrich, von, wilamowitz, moellendorff, reacted, against, the, views, of, the, schlegels, and, nietzsche, constructing, arguments, sympathetic, to, euripides, which, involved, wilamowitz, in, this, restatement, of, greek, tragedy, as, a, genre, a, tragedy, does, not, have, to, end, tragically, or, be, tragic, the, only, requirement, is, a, serious, treatment, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, pacifist, gilbert, murray, played, an, important, role, in, popularizing, euripides, influenced, perhaps, by, his, anti, war, plays, today, as, in, the, time, of, euripides, traditional, assumptions, are, constantly, under, challenge, and, audiences, therefore, have, a, natural, affinity, with, the, euripidean, outlook, which, seems, nearer, to, ours, for, example, than, the, elizabethan, as, stated, above, however, opinions, continue, to, diverge, so, that, modern, readers, might, actually, seem, to, feel, a, special, affinity, with, sophocles, one, recent, critic, might, dismiss, the, debates, in, euripides, plays, as, self, indulgent, digression, for, the, sake, of, rhetorical, display, and, one, spring, to, the, defence, his, plays, are, remarkable, for, their, range, of, tones, and, the, gleeful, inventiveness, which, morose, critics, call, cynical, artificiality, of, their, construction, unique, among, writers, of, ancient, athens, euripides, demonstrated, sympathy, towards, the, underrepresented, members, of, society, his, male, contemporaries, were, frequently, shocked, by, the, heresies, he, put, into, the, mouths, of, characters, such, as, these, words, of, his, heroine, medea, i, would, rather, stand, three, times, with, a, shield, in, battle, than, give, birth, once, the, textual, transmission, of, the, plays, from, the, 5th, century, bc, when, they, were, first, written, until, the, era, of, the, printing, press, was, a, largely, haphazard, process, much, of, euripides, work, was, lost, or, corrupted, but, the, period, also, included, triumphs, by, scholars, and, copyists, thanks, to, whom, much, was, recovered, and, preserved, summaries, of, the, transmission, are, often, found, in, modern, editions, of, the, plays, three, of, which, are, used, as, sources, for, this, summary, the, plays, of, euripides, like, those, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, circulated, in, written, form, but, literary, conventions, that, we, take, for, granted, today, had, not, been, invented, there, was, no, spacing, between, words, no, consistency, in, punctuation, nor, elisions, no, marks, for, breathings, and, accents, guides, to, pronunciation, and, word, recognition, no, convention, to, denote, change, of, speaker, no, stage, directions, and, verse, was, written, straight, across, the, page, like, prose, possibly, those, who, bought, texts, supplied, their, own, interpretative, markings, papyri, discoveries, have, indicated, for, example, that, a, change, in, speakers, was, loosely, denoted, with, a, variety, of, signs, such, as, equivalents, of, the, modern, dash, colon, and, full, stop, the, absence, of, modern, literary, conventions, which, aid, comprehension, was, an, early, and, persistent, source, of, errors, affecting, transmission, errors, were, also, introduced, when, athens, replaced, its, old, attic, alphabet, with, the, ionian, alphabet, a, change, sanctioned, by, law, in, 403, 402, bc, adding, a, new, complication, to, the, task, of, copying, many, more, errors, came, from, the, tendency, of, actors, to, interpolate, words, and, sentences, producing, so, many, corruptions, and, variations, that, a, law, was, proposed, by, lycurgus, of, athens, in, 330, bc, that, the, plays, of, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, should, be, written, down, and, preserved, in, a, public, office, and, that, the, town, clerk, should, read, the, text, over, with, the, actors, and, that, all, performances, which, did, not, comply, with, this, regulation, should, be, illegal, the, law, was, soon, disregarded, and, actors, continued, to, make, changes, until, about, 200, bc, after, which, the, habit, ceased, it, was, about, then, that, aristophanes, of, byzantium, compiled, an, edition, of, all, the, extant, plays, of, euripides, collated, from, pre, alexandrian, texts, furnished, with, introductions, and, accompanied, by, a, commentary, that, was, published, separately, this, became, the, standard, edition, for, the, future, and, it, featured, some, of, the, literary, conventions, that, modern, readers, expect, there, was, still, no, spacing, between, words, little, or, no, punctuation, and, no, stage, directions, but, abbreviated, names, denoted, changes, of, speaker, lyrics, were, broken, into, cola, and, strophai, or, lines, and, stanzas, and, a, system, of, accentuation, was, introduced, after, this, creation, of, a, standard, edition, the, text, was, fairly, safe, from, errors, besides, slight, and, gradual, corruption, introduced, with, tedious, copying, many, of, these, trivial, errors, occurred, in, the, byzantine, period, following, a, change, in, script, from, uncial, to, minuscule, and, many, were, homophonic, errors, equivalent, in, english, to, substituting, right, for, write, except, that, there, were, more, opportunities, for, byzantine, scribes, to, make, these, errors, because, and, were, pronounced, similarly, in, the, byzantine, period, around, 200, ad, ten, of, the, plays, of, euripides, began, to, be, circulated, in, a, select, edition, possibly, for, use, in, schools, with, some, commentaries, or, scholia, recorded, in, the, margins, similar, editions, had, appeared, for, aeschylus, and, sophocles, the, only, plays, of, theirs, that, survive, today, euripides, however, was, more, fortunate, than, the, other, tragedians, with, a, second, edition, of, his, work, surviving, compiled, in, alphabetical, order, as, if, from, a, set, of, his, collect, works, but, without, scholia, attached, this, alphabetical, edition, was, combined, with, the, select, edition, by, some, unknown, byzantine, scholar, bringing, together, all, the, nineteen, plays, that, survive, today, the, select, plays, are, found, in, many, medieval, manuscripts, but, only, two, manuscripts, preserve, the, alphabetical, plays, often, denoted, l, and, p, after, the, laurentian, library, at, florence, and, the, bibliotheca, palatina, in, the, vatican, where, they, are, stored, it, is, believed, that, p, derived, its, alphabet, plays, and, some, select, plays, from, copies, of, an, ancestor, of, l, but, the, remainder, is, derived, from, elsewhere, p, contains, all, the, extant, plays, of, euripides, l, is, missing, the, trojan, women, and, latter, part, of, the, bacchae, in, addition, to, l, p, and, many, other, medieval, manuscripts, there, are, fragments, of, plays, on, papyrus, these, papyrus, fragments, are, often, recovered, only, with, modern, technology, in, june, 2005, for, example, classicists, at, the, university, of, oxford, worked, on, a, joint, project, with, brigham, young, university, using, multi, spectral, imaging, technology, to, retrieve, previously, illegible, writing, see, references, some, of, this, work, employed, infrared, technology, previously, used, for, satellite, imaging, to, detect, previously, unknown, material, by, euripides, in, fragments, of, the, oxyrhynchus, papyri, a, collection, of, ancient, manuscripts, held, by, the, university, it, is, from, such, materials, that, modern, scholars, try, to, piece, together, copies, of, the, original, plays, sometimes, the, picture, is, almost, lost, thus, for, example, two, extant, plays, the, phoenician, women, and, iphigenia, in, aulis, are, significantly, corrupted, by, interpolations, the, latter, possibly, being, completed, post, mortem, by, the, poet, s, son, and, the, very, authorship, of, rhesus, is, a, matter, of, dispute, in, fact, the, very, existence, of, the, alphabet, plays, or, rather, the, absence, of, an, equivalent, edition, for, sophocles, and, aeschylus, could, distort, our, notions, of, distinctive, euripidean, qualities, most, of, his, least, tragic, plays, are, in, the, alphabet, edition, and, possibly, the, other, two, tragedians, would, appear, just, as, genre, bending, as, this, restless, experimenter, if, we, possessed, more, than, their, select, editions, see, extant, plays, below, for, listing, of, select, and, alphabetical, plays, original, production, dates, for, some, of, euripides, plays, are, known, from, ancient, records, such, as, lists, of, prize, winners, at, the, dionysia, and, approximations, are, obtained, for, the, remainder, by, various, means, both, the, playwright, and, his, work, were, travestied, by, comic, poets, such, as, aristophanes, the, known, dates, of, whose, own, plays, can, serve, as, a, terminus, ad, quem, for, those, of, euripides, though, the, gap, can, be, considerable, twenty, seven, years, separate, telephus, known, to, have, been, produced, in, 438, bc, from, its, parody, in, thesmophoriazusae, in, 411, bc, references, in, euripides, plays, to, contemporary, events, provide, a, terminus, a, quo, though, sometimes, the, references, might, even, precede, a, datable, event, e, g, lines, 1074, 89, in, ion, describe, a, procession, to, eleusis, which, was, probably, written, before, the, spartans, occupied, it, during, the, peloponnesian, war, other, indications, of, dating, are, obtained, by, stylometry, greek, tragedy, comprised, lyric, and, dialogue, the, latter, mostly, in, iambic, trimeter, three, pairs, of, iambic, feet, per, line, euripides, sometimes, resolved, the, two, syllables, of, the, iamb, into, three, syllables, and, this, tendency, increased, so, steadily, over, time, that, the, number, of, resolved, feet, in, a, play, can, indicate, an, approximate, date, of, composition, see, extant, plays, below, for, one, scholar, s, list, of, resolutions, per, hundred, trimeters, associated, with, this, increase, in, resolutions, was, an, increasing, vocabulary, often, involving, prefixes, to, refine, meanings, allowing, the, language, to, assume, a, more, natural, rhythm, while, also, becoming, ever, more, capable, of, psychological, and, philosophical, subtlety, the, trochaic, tetrameter, catalectic, four, pairs, of, trochees, per, line, with, the, final, syllable, omitted, was, identified, by, aristotle, as, the, original, meter, of, tragic, dialogue, poetics, 1449a21, euripides, employs, it, here, and, there, in, his, later, plays, but, seems, not, to, have, used, it, in, his, early, plays, at, all, with, the, trojan, women, being, the, earliest, appearance, of, it, in, an, extant, play, it, is, symptomatic, of, an, archaizing, tendency, in, his, later, works, the, later, plays, also, feature, extensive, use, of, stichomythia, i, e, a, series, of, one, liners, the, longest, such, scene, comprises, one, hundred, and, five, lines, in, ion, lines, 264, 369, in, contrast, aeschylus, never, exceeded, twenty, lines, of, stichomythia, sophocles, longest, such, scene, was, fifty, lines, and, that, is, interrupted, several, times, by, electra, lines, 1176, 1226, euripides,

demonstrate, his, virtuosity, in, lyrical, duets, as, well, as, replacing, some, of, the, chorus, s, functions, with, monodies, at, the, same, time, choral, odes, began, to, take, on, something, of, the, form, of, dithyrambs, reminiscent, of, the, poetry, of, bacchylides, featuring, elaborate, treatment, of, myths, sometimes, these, later, choral, odes, seem, to, have, only, a, tenuous, connection, with, the, plot, linked, to, the, action, only, in, their, mood, the, bacchae, however, shows, a, reversion, to, old, forms, possibly, as, a, deliberate, archaic, effect, or, because, there, were, no, virtuoso, choristers, in, macedonia, where, it, is, said, to, have, been, written, key, the, following, plays, have, come, down, to, us, in, fragmentary, form, if, at, all, they, are,
