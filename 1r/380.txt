was, sitting, at, the, table, i, was, not, at, all, curious, about, who, she, was, but, rather, took, her, for, granted, at, once, bony, empty, face, that, wore, its, emptiness, openly, bare, throat, a, blouse, thrown, on, looked, very, domestic, in, her, dress, although, as, it, turned, out, she, by, no, means, was, i, alienate, myself, from, her, a, little, by, inspecting, her, so, closely,

nothing, but, literature, and, can, and, want, to, be, nothing, else, nervous, states, of, the, worst, sort, control, me, without, pause, a, marriage, could, not, change, me, just, as, my, job, cannot, change, me, according, to, the, biographers, stach, and, james, hawes, kafka, became, engaged, a, third, time, around, 1920, to, julie, wohryzek, a, poor, and, uneducated, hotel, chambermaid,

rez, lvarez, has, claimed, that, kafka, had, symptomatology, consistent, with, schizoid, personality, disorder, his, style, it, is, claimed, not, only, in, die, verwandlung, the, metamorphosis, but, in, other, writings, appears, to, show, low, to, medium, level, schizoid, traits, which, p, rez, lvarez, claims, to, have, influenced, much, of, his, work, his, anguish, can, be, seen, in, this,

and, described, the, story, as, model, for, kafka, s, own, abandonment, fears, anxiety, depression, and, parasitic, dependency, needs, kafka, illuminated, the, borderline, s, general, confusion, of, normal, and, healthy, desires, wishes, and, needs, with, something, ugly, and, disdainful, though, kafka, never, married, he, held, marriage, and, children, in, high, esteem, he, had, several, girlfriends, and, lovers, during, his, life, he, may, have, suffered, from, an, eating, disorder, doctor, manfred, m, fichter, of, the, psychiatric, clinic, university, of, munich, presented,

elementary, and, high, schools, as, kafka, fell, out, with, kafka, during, their, last, academic, year, 1900, 1901, because, socialism, and, my, zionism, were, much, too, strident, bergmann, said, franz, became, a, socialist, i, became, a, zionist, in, 1898, the, synthesis, of, zionism, and, socialism, did, not, yet, exist, bergmann, claims, that, kafka, wore, a, red, carnation, to, school, to, show, his, support, for, socialism, in, one, diary, entry, kafka, made, reference, to, the, influential, anarchist, philosopher, peter, kropotkin, don, t, forget, kropotkin, during, the, communist, era, the, legacy, of, kafka, s, work, for, eastern, bloc, socialism, was, hotly, debated, opinions, ranged, from, the, notion, that, he, satirised, the, bureaucratic, bungling, of, a, crumbling, austro, hungarian, empire, to, the, belief, that, he, embodied, the, rise, of, socialism, a, further, key, point, was, marx, s, theory, of, alienation, while, the, orthodox, position, was, that, kafka, s, depictions, of, alienation, were, no, longer, relevant, for, a, society, that, had, supposedly, eliminated, alienation, a, 1963, conference, held, in, liblice, czechoslovakia, on, the, eightieth, anniversary, of, his, birth, reassessed, the, importance, of, kafka, s, portrayal, of, bureaucracy, whether, kafka, was, a, political, writer, is, still, an, issue, of, debate, kafka, grew, up, in, prague, as, a, german, speaking, jew, he, was, deeply, fascinated, by, the, jews, of, eastern, europe, who, he, thought, possessed, an, intensity, of, spiritual, life, that, was, absent, from, jews, in, the, west, his, diary, contains, many, references, to, yiddish, writers, yet, he, was, at, times, alienated, from, judaism, and, jewish, life, on, 8, january, 1914, he, wrote, in, his, diary, in, his, adolescent, years, kafka, declared, himself, an, atheist, hawes, suggests, that, kafka, though, very, aware, of, his, own, jewishness, did, not, incorporate, it, into, his, work, which, according, to, hawes, lacks, jewish, characters, scenes, or, themes, in, the, opinion, of, literary, critic, harold, bloom, although, kafka, was, uneasy, with, his, jewish, heritage, he, was, the, quintessential, jewish, writer, lothar, kahn, is, likewise, unequivocal, the, presence, of, jewishness, in, kafka, s, oeuvre, is, no, longer, subject, to, doubt, pavel, eisner, one, of, kafka, s, first, translators, interprets, der, process, the, trial, as, the, embodiment, of, the, triple, dimension, of, jewish, existence, in, prague, his, protagonist, josef, k, is, symbolically, arrested, by, a, german, rabensteiner, a, czech, kullich, and, a, jew, kaminer, he, stands, for, the, guiltless, guilt, that, imbues, the, jew, in, the, modern, world, although, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, himself, is, a, jew, in, his, essay, sadness, in, palestine, dan, miron, explores, kafka, s, connection, to, zionism, it, seems, that, those, who, claim, that, there, was, such, a, connection, and, that, zionism, played, a, central, role, in, his, life, and, literary, work, and, those, who, deny, the, connection, altogether, or, dismiss, its, importance, are, both, wrong, the, truth, lies, in, some, very, elusive, place, between, these, two, simplistic, poles, kafka, considered, moving, to, palestine, with, felice, bauer, and, later, with, dora, diamant, he, studied, hebrew, while, living, in, berlin, hiring, a, friend, of, brod, s, from, palestine, pua, bat, tovim, to, tutor, him, and, attending, rabbi, julius, gr, nthal, and, rabbi, julius, guttmann, s, classes, in, the,

their, writings, a, broad, cosmopolitan, outlook, and, a, quality, of, exaltation, bordering, on, transcendental, metaphysical, contemplation, an, illustrious, example, is, franz, kafka, towards, the, end, of, his, life, kafka, sent, a, postcard, to, his, friend, hugo, bergmann, in, tel, aviv, announcing, his, intention, to, emigrate, to, palestine, bergmann, refused, to, host, kafka, because, he, had, young, children, and, was, afraid, that, kafka, would, infect, them, with, tuberculosis, kafka, s, laryngeal, tuberculosis, worsened, and, in, march, 1924, he, returned, from, berlin, to, prague, where, members, of, his, family, principally, his, sister, ottla, and, dora, diamant, took, care, of, him, he, went, to, hugo, hoffmann, s, sanatorium, in, kierling, just, outside, vienna, for, treatment, on, 10, april, and, died, there, on, 3, june, 1924, the, cause, of, death, seemed, to, be, starvation, the, condition, of, kafka, s, throat, made, eating, too, painful, for, him, and, since, parenteral, nutrition, had, not, yet, been, developed, there, was, no, way, to, feed, him, kafka, was, editing, a, hunger, artist, on, his, deathbed, a, story, whose, composition, he, had,

around, 90, percent, of, his, work, much, of, it, during, the, period, he, lived, in, berlin, with, diamant, who, helped, him, burn, the, drafts, in, his, early, years, as, a, writer, he, was, influenced, by, von, kleist, whose, work, he, described, in, a, letter, to, bauer, as, frightening, and, whom, he, considered, closer, than, his, own, family, kafka, drew, and, sketched, extensively,

brandenfeld, to, franz, kafka, and, felice, bauer, the, story, is, often, considered, kafka, s, breakthrough, work, it, deals, with, the, troubled, relationship, of, a, son, and, his, dominant, father, facing, a, new, situation, after, the, son, s, engagement, kafka, later, described, writing, it, as, a, complete, opening, of, body, and, soul, a, story, that, evolved, as, a, true, birth, covered, with, filth, and, slime, the, story, was, first, published, in, leipzig, in, 1912, and, dedicated, to, miss, felice, bauer, and, in, subsequent, editions, for, f, in, 1912, kafka, wrote, die,

its, first, chapter, is, the, story, der, heizer, the, stoker, he, called, the, work, which, remained, unfinished, der, verschollene, the, man, who, disappeared, or, the, missing, person, but, when, brod, published, it, after, kafka, s, death, he, named, it, amerika, the, inspiration, for, the, novel, was, the, time, kafka, spent, in, the, audience, of, yiddish, theatre, the, previous, year, bringing, him, to, a, new, awareness, of, his, heritage, which, led, to, the, thought, that, an, innate, appreciation, for, one, s, heritage, lives, deep, within, each, person, more, explicitly, humorous, and, slightly, more, realistic, than, most, of, kafka, s, works, the, novel, shares, the, motif, of, an, oppressive, and, intangible, system, putting, the, protagonist, repeatedly, in, bizarre, situations, it, uses, many, details, of, experiences, from, his, relatives, who, had, emigrated, to, america, and, is, the, only, work, for, which, kafka, considered, an, optimistic, ending, in, 1914, kafka, began, the, novel, der, process, the, trial, the, story, of, a, man, arrested, and, prosecuted, by, a, remote, inaccessible, authority, with, the, nature, of, his, crime, revealed, neither, to, him, nor, to, the, reader, he, did, not, complete, the, novel, although, he, finished, the, final, chapter, according, to, nobel, prize, winning, author, elias, canetti, felice, is, central, to, the, plot, of, der, process, and, kafka, said, it, was, her, story, canetti, titled, his, book, on, kafka, s, letters, to, felice, kafka, s, other, trial, in, recognition, of, the, relationship, between, the, letters, and, the, novel, michiko, kakutani, notes, in, a, review, for, the, new, york, times, that, kafka, s, letters, have, the, earmarks, of, his, fiction, the, same, nervous, attention, to, minute, particulars, the, same, paranoid, awareness, of, shifting, balances, of, power, the, same, atmosphere, of, emotional, suffocation, combined, surprisingly, enough, with, moments, of, boyish, ardour, and, delight, according, to, his, diary, kafka, was, already, planning, his, novel, das, schloss, the, castle, by, 11, june, 1914, however, he, did, not, begin, writing, it, until, 27, january, 1922, the, protagonist, is, the, landvermesser, land, surveyor, named, k, who, struggles, for, unknown, reasons, to, gain, access, to, the, mysterious, authorities, of, a, castle, who, govern, the, village, kafka, s, intent, was, that, the, castle, s, authorities, notify, k, on, his, deathbed, that, his, legal, claim, to, live, in, the, village, was, not, valid, yet, taking, certain, auxiliary, circumstances, into, account, he, was, to, be, permitted, to, live, and, work, there, dark, and, at, times, surreal, the, novel, is, focused, on, alienation, bureaucracy,

poet, w, h, auden, called, kafka, the, dante, of, the, twentieth, century, the, novelist, vladimir, nabokov, placed, him, among, the, greatest, writers, of, the, 20th, century, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, noted, the, reading, of, kafka, s, the, metamorphosis, showed, him, that, it, was, possible, to, write, in, a, different, way, a, prominent, theme, of, kafka, s, work, first, established, in, the, short, story, das, urteil, is, father, son, conflict, the, guilt, induced, in, the, son, is, resolved, through, suffering, and, atonement, other, prominent, themes, and, archetypes, include, alienation, physical, and, psychological, brutality, characters, on, a, terrifying, quest, and, mystical, transformation, kafka, s, style, has, been, compared, to, that, of, kleist, as, early, as, 1916, in, a, review, of, die, verwandlung, and, der, heizer, by, oscar, walzel, in, berliner, beitr, ge, the, nature, of, kafka, s, prose, allows, for, varied, interpretations, and, critics, have, placed, his, writing, into, a, variety, of, literary, schools, marxists, for, example, have, sharply, disagreed, over, how, to, interpret, kafka, s, works, some, accused, him, of, distorting, reality, whereas, others, claimed, he, was, critiquing, capitalism, the, hopelessness, and, absurdity, common, to, his, works, are, seen, as, emblematic, of, existentialism, some, of, kafka, s, books, are, influenced, by, the, expressionist, movement, though, the, majority, of, his, literary, output, was, associated, with, the, experimental, modernist, genre, kafka, also, touches, on, the, theme, of, human, conflict, with, bureaucracy, william, burrows, claims, that, such, work, is, centred, on, the, concepts, of, struggle, pain, solitude, and, the, need, for, relationships, others, such, as, thomas, mann, see, kafka, s, work, as, allegorical, a, quest, metaphysical, in, nature, for, god, according, to, gilles, deleuze, and, f, lix, guattari, the, themes, of, alienation, and, persecution, although, present, in, kafka, s, work, have, been, overemphasised, by, critics, they, argue, that, kafka, s, work, is, more, deliberate, and, subversive, and, more, joyful, than, may, first, appear, they, point, out, that, reading, kafka, while, focusing, on, the, futility, of, his, characters, struggles, reveals, kafka, s, humour, he, is, not, necessarily, commenting, on, his, own, problems, but, rather, pointing, out, how, people, tend, to, invent, problems, in, his, work, kafka, often, creates, malevolent, absurd, worlds, kafka, read, drafts, of, his, works, to, his, friends, typically, concentrating, on, his, humorous, prose, the, writer, milan, kundera, suggests, that, kafka, s, surrealist, humour, may, have, been, an, inversion, of, dostoevsky, s, presentation, of, characters, who, are, punished, for, a, crime, in, kafka, s, work, a, character, is, punished, although, a, crime, has, not, been, committed, kundera, believes, that, kafka, s, inspirations, for, his, characteristic, situations, came, both, from, growing, up, in, a, patriarchal, family, and, from, living, in, a, totalitarian, state, attempts, have, been, made, to, identify, the, influence, of, kafka, s, legal, background, and, the, role, of, law, in, his, fiction, most, interpretations, identify, aspects, of, law, and, legality, as, important, in, his, work, in, which, the, legal, system, is, often, oppressive, the, law, in, kafka, s, works, rather, than, being, representative, of, any, particular, legal, or, political, entity, is, usually, interpreted, to, represent, a, collection, of, anonymous, incomprehensible, forces, these, are, hidden, from, the, individual, but, control, the, lives, of, the, people, who, are, innocent, victims, of, systems, beyond, their, control, critics, who, support, this, absurdist, interpretation, cite, instances, where, kafka, describes, himself, in, conflict, with, an, absurd, universe, such, as, the, following, entry, from, his, diary, enclosed, in, my, own, four, walls, i, found, myself, as, an, immigrant, imprisoned, in, a, foreign, country, i, saw, my, family, as, strange, aliens, whose, foreign, customs, rites, and, very, language, defied, comprehension, though, i, did, not, want, it, they, forced, me, to, participate, in, their, bizarre, rituals, i, could, not, resist, however, james, hawes, argues, many, of, kafka, s, descriptions, of, the, legal, proceedings, in, der, process, metaphysical, absurd, bewildering, and, nightmarish, as, they, might, appear, are, based, on, accurate, and, informed, descriptions, of, german, and, austrian, criminal, proceedings, of, the, time, which, were, inquisitorial, rather, than, adversarial, although, he, worked, in, insurance, as, a, trained, lawyer, kafka, was, keenly, aware, of, the, legal, debates, of, his, day, in, an, early, 21st, century, publication, that, uses, kafka, s, office, writings, as, its, point, of, departure, pothik, ghosh, states, that, with, kafka, law, has, no, meaning, outside, its, fact, of, being, a, pure, force, of, domination, and, determination, the, first, instance, of, kafka, being, translated, into, english, was, in, 1925, when, william, a, drake, published, a, report, for, an, academy, in, the, new, york, herald, tribune, eugene, jolas, translated, kafka, s, the, judgment, for, the, modernist, journal, transition, in, 1928, in, 1930, edwin, and, willa, muir, translated, the, first, german, edition, of, das, schloss, this, was, published, as, the, castle, by, secker, warburg, in, england, and, alfred, a, knopf, in, the, united, states, a, 1941, edition, including, a, homage, by, thomas, mann, spurred, a, surge, in, kafka, s, popularity, in, the, united, states, during, the, late, 1940s, the, muirs, translated, all, shorter, works, that, kafka, had, seen, fit, to, print, they, were, published, by, schocken, books, in, 1948, as, the, penal, colony, stories, and, short, pieces, including, additionally, the, first, long, train, journey, written, by, kafka, and, brod, kafka, s, a, novel, about, youth, a, review, of, felix, sternheim, s, die, geschichte, des, jungen, oswald, his, essay, on, kleist, s, anecdotes, his, review, of, the, literary, magazine, hyperion, and, an, epilogue, by, brod, later, editions, notably, those, of, 1954, dearest, father, stories, and, other, writings, included, text, translated, by, eithne, wilkins, and, ernst, kaiser, that, had, been, deleted, by, earlier, publishers, known, as, definitive, editions, they, include, translations, of, the, trial, definitive, the, castle, definitive, and, other, writings, these, translations, are, generally, accepted, to, have, a, number, of, biases, and, are, considered, to, be, dated, in, interpretation, published, in, 1961, by, schocken, books, parables, and, paradoxes, presented, in, a, bilingual, edition, by, nahum, n, glatzer, selected, writings, drawn, from, notebooks, diaries, letters, short, fictional, works, and, the,

by, mark, harman, schocken, books, 2008, kafka, often, made, extensive, use, of, a, characteristic, particular, to, german, which, permits, long, sentences, that, sometimes, can, span, an, entire, page, kafka, s, sentences, then, deliver, an, unexpected, impact, just, before, the, full, stop, this, being, the, finalizing, meaning, and, focus, this, is, due, to, the, construction, of, subordinate, clauses, in, german, which, require, that, the, verb, be, at, the, end, of, the, sentence, such, constructions, are, difficult, to, duplicate, in, english, so, it, is, up, to, the, translator, to, provide, the, reader, with, the, same, or, at, least, equivalent, effect, as, the, original, text, german, s, more, flexible, word, order, and, syntactical, differences, provide, for, multiple, ways, in, which, the, same, german, writing, can, be, translated, into, english, an, example, is, the, first, sentence, of, kafka, s, the, metamorphosis, which, is, crucial, to, the, setting, and, understanding, of, the, entire, story, als, gregor, samsa, eines, morgens, aus, unruhigen, tr, umen, erwachte, fand, er, sich, in, seinem, bett, zu, einem, ungeheuren, ungeziefer, verwandelt, as, gregor, samsa, one, morning, from, restless, dreams, awoke, found, he, himself, in, his, bed, into, a, monstrous, vermin, transformed, the, sentence, above, also, exemplifies, an, instance, of, another, difficult, problem, facing, translators, dealing, with, the, author, s, intentional, use, of, ambiguous, idioms, and, words, that, have, several, meanings, which, results, in, phrasing, that, is, difficult, to, translate, precisely, english, translators, often, render, the, word, ungeziefer, as, insect, in, middle, german, however, ungeziefer, literally, means, an, animal, unclean, for, sacrifice, in, today, s, german, it, means, vermin, it, is, sometimes, used, colloquially, to, mean, bug, a, very, general, term, unlike, the, scientific, insect, kafka, had, no, intention, of, labeling, gregor, the, protagonist, of, the, story, as, any, specific, thing, but, instead, wanted, to, convey, gregor, s, disgust, at, his, transformation, another, example, of, this, can, be, found, in, the, final, sentence, of, das, urteil, the, judgement, with, kafka, s, use, of, the, german, noun, verkehr, literally, verkehr, means, intercourse, and, as, in, english, can, have, either, a, sexual, or, a, non, sexual, meaning, the, word, is, additionally, used, to, mean, transport, or, traffic, therefore, the, sentence, can, also, be, translated, as, at, that, moment, an, unending, stream, of, traffic, crossed, over, the, bridge, the, double, meaning, of, verkehr, is, given, added, weight, by, kafka, s, confession, to, brod, that, when, he, wrote, that, final, line, he, was, thinking, of, a, violent, ejaculation, unlike, many, famous, writers, kafka, is, rarely, quoted, by, others, instead, he, is, noted, more, for, his, visions, and, perspective, kafka, had, a, strong, influence, on, gabriel, garc, a, m, rquez, milan, kundera, and, the, novel, the, palace, of, dreams, by, ismail, kadare, shimon, sandbank, a, professor, literary, critic, and, writer, also, identifies, kafka, as, having, influenced, jorge, luis, borges, albert, camus, eug, ne, ionesco, j, m, coetzee, and, jean, paul, sartre, a, financial, times, literary, critic, credits, kafka, with, influencing, jos, saramago, and, al, silverman, a, writer, and, editor, states, that, j, d, salinger, loved, to, read, kafka, s, works, the, romanian, writer, mircea, c, rt, rescu, said, kafka, is, the, author, i, love, the, most, and, who, means, for, me, the, gate, to, literature, he, also, described, kafka, as, the, saint, of, literature, kafka, has, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, the, swedish, writer, stig, dagerman, and, the, japanese, writer, haruki, murakami, who, paid, homage, to, kafka, in, his, novel, kafka, on, the, shore, with, the, namesake, protagonist, in, 1999, a, committee, of, 99, authors, scholars, and, literary, critics, ranked, der, process, and, das, schloss, the, second, and, ninth, most, significant, german, language, novels, of, the, 20th, century, harold, bloom, said, when, he, is, most, himself, kafka, gives, us, a, continuous, inventiveness, and, originality, that, rivals, dante, and, truly, challenges, proust, and, joyce, as, that, of, the, dominant, western, author, of, our, century, sandbank, argues, that, despite, kafka, s, pervasiveness, his, enigmatic, style, has, yet, to, be, emulated, neil, christian, pages, a, professor, of, german, studies, and, comparative, literature, at, binghamton, university, who, specialises, in, kafka, s, works, says, kafka, s, influence, transcends, literature, and, literary, scholarship, it, impacts, visual, arts, music, and, popular, culture, harry, steinhauer, a, professor, of, german, and, jewish, literature, says, that, kafka, has, made, a, more, powerful, impact, on, literate, society, than, any, other, writer, of, the, twentieth, century, brod, said, that, the, 20th, century, will, one, day, be, known, as, the, century, of, kafka, michel, andr, bossy, writes, that, kafka, created, a, rigidly, inflexible, and, sterile, bureaucratic, universe, kafka, wrote, in, an, aloof, manner, full, of, legal, and, scientific, terms, yet, his, serious, universe, also, had, insightful, humour, all, highlighting, the, irrationality, at, the, roots, of, a, supposedly, rational, world, his, characters, are, trapped, confused, full, of, guilt, frustrated, and, lacking, understanding, of, their, surreal, world, much, post, kafka, fiction, especially, science, fiction, follows, the, themes, and, precepts, of, kafka, s, universe, this, can, be, seen, in, the, works, of, authors, such, as, george, orwell, and, ray, bradbury, the, following, are, examples, of, works, across, a, range, of, dramatic, literary, and, musical, genres, that, demonstrate, the, extent, of, kafka, s, cultural, influence, the, term, kafkaesque, is, used, to, describe, concepts, and, situations, reminiscent, of, kafka, s, work, particularly, der, process, the, trial, and, die, verwandlung, the, metamorphosis, examples, include, instances, in, which, bureaucracies, overpower, people, often, in, a, surreal, nightmarish, milieu, that, evokes, feelings, of, senselessness, disorientation, and, helplessness, characters, in, a, kafkaesque, setting, often, lack, a, clear, course, of, action, to, escape, a, labyrinthine, situation, kafkaesque, elements, often, appear, in, existential, works, but, the, term, has, transcended, the, literary, realm, to, apply, to, real, life, occurrences, and, situations, that, are, incomprehensibly, complex, bizarre, or, illogical, numerous, films, and, television, works, have, been, described, as, kafkaesque, and, the, style, is, particularly, prominent, in, dystopian, science, fiction, works, in, this, genre, that, have, been, thus, described, include, patrick, bokanowski, s, film, the, angel, 1982, terry, gilliam, s, film, brazil, 1985, and, alex, proyas, science, fiction, film, noir, dark, city, 1998, films, from, other, genres, which, have, been, similarly, described, include, roman, polanski, s, the, tenant, 1976, joseph, losey, s, monsieur, klein, 1976, and, the, coen, brothers, barton, fink, 1991, the, television, series, the, prisoner, and, the, twilight, zone, are, also, frequently, described, as, kafkaesque, however, with, common, usage, the, term, has, become, so, ubiquitous, that, kafka, scholars, note, it, is, often, misused, more, accurately, then, according, to, author, ben, marcus, paraphrased, in, what, it, means, to, be, kafkaesque, by, joe, fassler, in, the, atlantic, kafka, s, quintessential, qualities, are, affecting, use, of, language, a, setting, that, straddles, fantasy, and, reality, and, a, sense, of, striving, even, in, the, face, of, bleakness, hopelessly, and, full, of, hope, 3412, kafka,
