caspar, david, friedrich, 5, september, 1774, 7, may, 1840, was, a, german, romantic, landscape, painter, generally, considered, the, most, important, german, artist, of, his, generation, he, is, best, known, for, his, allegorical, landscapes, which, typically, feature, contemplative, figures, silhouetted, against, night, skies, morning, mists, barren, trees, or, gothic, ruins, his, primary, interest, was, the, contemplation, of, nature, and, his, often, symbolic, and, anti, classical, work, seeks, to, convey, a, subjective, emotional, response, to, the, natural, world, friedrich, s, paintings, characteristically, set, a, human, presence, in, diminished, perspective, amid, expansive, landscapes, reducing, the, figures, to, a, scale, that, according, to, the, art, historian, christopher, john, murray, directs, the, viewer, s, gaze, towards, their, metaphysical, dimension, friedrich, was, born, in, the, town, of, greifswald, on, the, baltic, sea, in, what, was, at, the, time, swedish, pomerania, he, studied, in, copenhagen, until, 1798, before, settling, in, dresden, he, came, of, age, during, a, period, when, across, europe, a, growing, disillusionment, with, materialistic, society, was, giving, rise, to, a, new, appreciation, of, spirituality, this, shift, in, ideals, was, often, expressed, through, a, reevaluation, of, the, natural, world, as, artists, such, as, friedrich, j, m, w, turner, and, john, constable, sought, to, depict, nature, as, a, divine, creation, to, be, set, against, the, artifice, of, human, civilization, friedrich, s, work, brought, him, renown, early, in, his, career, contemporaries, such, as, the, french, sculptor, david, d, angers, spoke, of, him, as, having, discovered, the, tragedy, of, landscape, his, work, nevertheless, fell, from, favour, during, his, later, years, and, he, died, in, obscurity, as, germany, moved, towards, modernisation, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, new, sense, of, urgency, characterised, its, art, and, friedrich, s, contemplative, depictions, of, stillness, came, to, be, seen, as, products, of, a, bygone, age, the, early, 20th, century, brought, a, renewed, appreciation, of, his, art, beginning, in, 1906, with, an, exhibition, of, thirty, two, of, his, paintings, in, berlin, his, work, influenced, expressionist, artists, and, later, surrealists, and, existentialists, the, rise, of, nazism, in, the, early, 1930s, saw, a, resurgence, in, friedrich, s, popularity, but, this, was, followed, by, a, sharp, decline, as, his, paintings, were, by, association, with, the, nazi, movement, seen, as, promoting, german, nationalism, in, the, late, 1970s, friedrich, regained, his, reputation, as, an, icon, of, the, german, romantic, movement, and, a, painter, of, international, importance, his, work, has, been, brought, together, in, a, major, exhibition, in, germany, in, 2024, under, the, title, infinitive, landscapes, which, refers, to, the, philosopher, friedrich, schleiermacher, who, was, important, to, friedrich, and, whose, mathematics, of, infinity, found, its, way, into, friedrich, s, geometrically, constructed, paintings, as, hyperbolas, and, the, golden, ratio, in, 2025, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, will, also, show, an, exhibition, on, caspar, david, friedrich, under, the, title, caspar, david, friedrich, the, soul, of, nature, caspar, david, friedrich, was, born, on, 5, september, 1774, in, greifswald, swedish, pomerania, on, the, baltic, coast, of, germany, the, sixth, of, ten, children, he, was, raised, in, the, strict, lutheran, creed, of, his, father, adolf, gottlieb, friedrich, a, candle, maker, and, soap, boiler, records, of, the, family, s, financial, circumstances, are, contradictory, while, some, sources, indicate, the, children, were, privately, tutored, others, record, that, they, were, raised, in, relative, poverty, he, became, familiar, with, death, from, an, early, age, his, mother, sophie, died, in, 1781, when, he, was, seven, a, year, later, his, sister, elisabeth, died, and, a, second, sister, maria, succumbed, to, typhus, in, 1791, arguably, the, greatest, tragedy, of, his, childhood, happened, in, 1787, when, his, brother, johann, christoffer, died, at, the, age, of, thirteen, caspar, david, witnessed, his, younger, brother, fall, through, the, ice, of, a, frozen, lake, and, drown, some, accounts, suggest, that, johann, christoffer, perished, while, trying, to, rescue, caspar, david, who, was, also, in, danger, on, the, ice, friedrich, began, his, formal, study, of, art, in, 1790, as, a, private, student, of, artist, johann, gottfried, quistorp, at, the, university, of, greifswald, in, his, home, city, at, which, the, art, department, is, now, named, caspar, david, friedrich, institut, in, his, honour, quistorp, took, his, students, on, outdoor, drawing, excursions, as, a, result, friedrich, was, encouraged, to, sketch, from, life, at, an, early, age, through, quistorp, friedrich, met, and, was, subsequently, influenced, by, the, theologian, ludwig, gotthard, kosegarten, who, taught, that, nature, was, a, revelation, of, god, quistorp, introduced, friedrich, to, the, work, of, the, german, 17th, century, artist, adam, elsheimer, whose, works, often, included, religious, subjects, dominated, by, landscape, and, nocturnal, subjects, during, this, period, he, also, studied, literature, and, aesthetics, with, swedish, professor, thomas, thorild, four, years, later, friedrich, entered, the, prestigious, academy, of, copenhagen, where, he, began, his, education, by, making, copies, of, casts, from, antique, sculptures, before, proceeding, to, drawing, from, life, living, in, copenhagen, afforded, the, young, painter, access, to, the, royal, picture, gallery, s, collection, of, 17th, century, dutch, landscape, painting, at, the, academy, he, studied, under, teachers, such, as, christian, august, lorentzen, and, the, landscape, painter, jens, juel, these, artists, were, inspired, by, the, sturm, und, drang, movement, and, represented, a, midpoint, between, the, dramatic, intensity, and, expressive, manner, of, the, budding, romantic, aesthetic, and, the, waning, neo, classical, ideal, mood, was, paramount, and, influence, was, drawn, from, such, sources, as, the, icelandic, legend, of, edda, the, poems, of, ossian, and, norse, mythology, friedrich, settled, permanently, in, dresden, in, 1798, during, this, early, period, he, experimented, in, printmaking, with, etchings, and, designs, for, woodcuts, which, his, furniture, maker, brother, cut, by, 1804, he, had, produced, 18, etchings, and, four, woodcuts, they, were, apparently, made, in, small, numbers, and, only, distributed, to, friends, despite, these, forays, into, other, media, he, gravitated, toward, working, primarily, with, ink, watercolour, and, sepias, with, the, exception, of, a, few, early, pieces, such, as, landscape, with, temple, in, ruins, 1797, he, did, not, work, extensively, with, oils, until, his, reputation, was, more, established, landscapes, were, his, preferred, subject, inspired, by, frequent, trips, beginning, in, 1801, to, the, baltic, coast, bohemia, the, krkono, e, and, the, harz, mountains, mostly, based, on, the, landscapes, of, northern, germany, his, paintings, depict, woods, hills, harbors, morning, mists, and, other, light, effects, based, on, a, close, observation, of, nature, these, works, were, modeled, on, sketches, and, studies, of, scenic, spots, such, as, the, cliffs, on, r, gen, the, surroundings, of, dresden, and, the, river, elbe, he, executed, his, studies, almost, exclusively, in, pencil, even, providing, topographical, information, yet, the, subtle, atmospheric, effects, characteristic, of, friedrich, s, mid, period, paintings, were, rendered, from, memory, these, effects, took, their, strength, from, the, depiction, of, light, and, of, the, illumination, of, sun, and, moon, on, clouds, and, water, optical, phenomena, peculiar, to, the, baltic, coast, that, had, never, before, been, painted, with, such, an, emphasis, his, reputation, as, an, artist, was, established, when, he, won, a, prize, in, 1805, at, the, weimar, competition, organised, by, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, at, the, time, the, weimar, competition, tended, to, draw, mediocre, and, now, forgotten, artists, presenting, derivative, mixtures, of, neo, classical, and, pseudo, greek, styles, the, poor, quality, of, the, entries, began, to, prove, damaging, to, goethe, s, reputation, so, when, friedrich, entered, two, sepia, drawings, procession, at, dawn, and, fisher, folk, by, the, sea, the, poet, responded, enthusiastically, and, wrote, we, must, praise, the, artist, s, resourcefulness, in, this, picture, fairly, the, drawing, is, well, done, the, procession, is, ingenious, and, appropriate, his, treatment, combines, a, great, deal, of, firmness, diligence, and, neatness, the, ingenious, watercolour, is, also, worthy, of, praise, friedrich, completed, the, first, of, his, major, paintings, in, 1808, at, the, age, of, 34, cross, in, the, mountains, today, known, as, the, tetschen, altar, is, an, altarpiece, panel, said, to, have, been, commissioned, for, a, family, chapel, in, tetschen, bohemia, the, panel, depicts, a, cross, in, profile, at, the, top, of, a, mountain, alone, and, surrounded, by, pine, trees, although, the, altarpiece, was, generally, coldly, received, it, was, friedrich, s, first, painting, to, receive, wide, publicity, the, artist, s, friends, publicly, defended, the, work, while, art, critic, basilius, von, ramdohr, published, a, long, article, challenging, friedrich, s, use, of, landscape, in, a, religious, context, he, rejected, the, idea, that, landscape, painting, could, convey, explicit, meaning, writing, that, it, would, be, a, veritable, presumption, if, landscape, painting, were, to, sneak, into, the, church, and, creep, onto, the, altar, friedrich, responded, with, a, programme, describing, his, intentions, in, 1809, comparing, the, rays, of, the, evening, sun, to, the, light, of, the, holy, father, this, statement, marked, the, only, time, friedrich, recorded, a, detailed, interpretation, of, his, own, work, and, the, painting, was, among, the, few, commissions, the, artist, ever, received, following, the, purchase, of, two, of, his, paintings, by, the, prussian, crown, prince, friedrich, was, elected, a, member, of, the, berlin, academy, in, 1810, yet, in, 1816, he, sought, to, distance, himself, from, prussian, authority, and, applied, that, june, for, saxon, citizenship, the, move, was, not, expected, the, saxon, government, was, pro, french, while, friedrich, s, paintings, were, seen, as, generally, patriotic, and, distinctly, anti, french, nevertheless, with, the, aid, of, his, dresden, based, friend, graf, vitzthum, von, eckst, dt, friedrich, attained, citizenship, and, in, 1818, membership, in, the, saxon, academy, with, a, yearly, dividend, of, 150, thalers, although, he, had, hoped, to, receive, a, full, professorship, it, was, never, awarded, him, as, according, to, the, german, library, of, information, it, was, felt, that, his, painting, was, too, personal, his, point, of, view, too, individual, to, serve, as, a, fruitful, example, to, students, politics, too, may, have, played, a, role, in, stalling, his, career, friedrich, s, decidedly, germanic, subjects, and, costuming, frequently, clashed, with, the, era, s, prevailing, pro, french, attitudes, on, 21, january, 1818, friedrich, married, caroline, bommer, the, twenty, five, year, old, daughter, of, a, dyer, from, dresden, the, couple, had, three, children, with, their, first, emma, arriving, in, 1820, physiologist, and, painter, carl, gustav, carus, notes, in, his, biographical, essays, that, marriage, did, not, impact, significantly, on, either, friedrich, s, life, or, personality, yet, his, canvasses, from, this, period, including, chalk, cliffs, on, r, gen, painted, after, his, honeymoon, display, a, new, sense, of, levity, while, his, palette, is, brighter, and, less, austere, human, figures, appear, with, increasing, frequency, in, the, paintings, of, this, period, which, siegel, interprets, as, a, reflection, that, the, importance, of, human, life, particularly, his, family, now, occupies, his, thoughts, more, and, more, and, his, friends, his, wife, and, his, townspeople, appear, as, frequent, subjects, in, his, art, around, this, time, he, found, support, from, two, sources, in, russia, in, 1820, the, grand, duke, nikolai, pavlovich, at, the, behest, of, his, wife, alexandra, feodorovna, visited, friedrich, s, studio, and, returned, to, saint, petersburg, with, a, number, of, his, paintings, an, exchange, that, began, a, patronage, that, continued, for, many, years, not, long, thereafter, the, poet, vasily, zhukovsky, tutor, to, the, grand, duke, s, son, later, tsar, alexander, ii, met, friedrich, in, 1821, and, found, in, him, a, kindred, spirit, for, decades, zhukovsky, helped, friedrich, both, by, purchasing, his, work, himself, and, by, recommending, his, art, to, the, royal, family, his, assistance, toward, the, end, of, friedrich, s, career, proved, invaluable, to, the, ailing, and, impoverished, artist, zhukovsky, remarked, that, his, friend, s, paintings, please, us, by, their, precision, each, of, them, awakening, a, memory, in, our, mind, friedrich, was, acquainted, with, philipp, otto, runge, another, leading, german, painter, of, the, romantic, period, he, was, also, a, friend, of, georg, friedrich, kersting, and, painted, him, at, work, in, his, unadorned, studio, and, of, the, norwegian, painter, johan, christian, clausen, dahl, 1788, 1857, dahl, was, close, to, friedrich, during, the, artist, s, final, years, and, he, expressed, dismay, that, to, the, art, buying, public, friedrich, s, pictures, were, only, curiosities, while, the, poet, zhukovsky, appreciated, friedrich, s, psychological, themes, dahl, praised, the, descriptive, quality, of, friedrich, s, landscapes, commenting, that, artists, and, connoisseurs, saw, in, friedrich, s, art, only, a, kind, of, mystic, because, they, themselves, were, only, looking, out, for, the, mystic, they, did, not, see, friedrich, s, faithful, and, conscientious, study, of, nature, in, everything, he, represented, friedrich, s, reputation, steadily, declined, over, the, final, fifteen, years, of, his, life, as, the, ideals, of, early, romanticism, passed, from, fashion, he, came, to, be, viewed, as, an, eccentric, and, melancholy, character, out, of, touch, with, the, times, gradually, his, patrons, fell, away, by, 1820, he, was, living, as, a, recluse, and, was, described, by, friends, as, the, most, solitary, of, the, solitary, towards, the, end, of, his, life, he, lived, in, relative, poverty, he, became, isolated, and, spent, long, periods, of, the, day, and, night, walking, alone, through, woods, and, fields, often, beginning, his, strolls, before, sunrise, he, suffered, his, first, stroke, in, june, 1835, which, left, him, with, minor, limb, paralysis, and, greatly, reduced, his, ability, to, paint, as, a, result, he, was, unable, to, work, in, oil, instead, he, was, limited, to, watercolour, sepia, and, reworking, older, compositions, although, his, vision, remained, strong, he, had, lost, the, full, strength, of, his, hand, yet, he, was, able, to, produce, a, final, black, painting, seashore, by, moonlight, 1835, 1836, described, by, vaughan, as, the, darkest, of, all, his, shorelines, in, which, richness, of, tonality, compensates, for, the, lack, of, his, former, finesse, symbols, of, death, appeared, in, his, work, from, this, period, soon, after, his, stroke, the, russian, royal, family, purchased, a, number, of, his, earlier, works, and, the, proceeds, allowed, him, to, travel, to, teplitz, in, today, s, czech, republic, to, recover, during, the, mid, 1830s, friedrich, began, a, series, of, portraits, and, he, returned, to, observing, himself, in, nature, as, the, art, historian, william, vaughan, observed, however, he, can, see, himself, as, a, man, greatly, changed, he, is, no, longer, the, upright, supportive, figure, that, appeared, in, two, men, contemplating, the, moon, in, 1819, he, is, old, and, stiff, he, moves, with, a, stoop, by, 1838, he, was, capable, of, working, in, a, small, format, only, he, and, his, family, were, living, in, poverty, and, grew, increasingly, dependent, for, support, on, the, charity, of, friends, friedrich, died, in, dresden, on, 7, may, 1840, and, was, buried, in, dresden, s, trinitatis, friedhof, trinity, cemetery, east, of, the, city, centre, the, entrance, to, which, he, had, painted, some, 15, years, earlier, his, simple, flat, gravestone, lies, north, west, of, the, central, roundel, within, the, main, avenue, by, this, time, his, reputation, and, fame, had, waned, and, his, passing, was, little, noticed, within, the, artistic, community, his, artwork, had, certainly, been, acknowledged, during, his, lifetime, but, not, widely, while, the, close, study, of, landscape, and, an, emphasis, on, the, spiritual, elements, of, nature, were, commonplace, in, contemporary, art, his, interpretations, were, highly, original, and, personal, by, 1838, his, work, no, longer, sold, or, received, attention, from, critics, the, romantic, movement, had, moved, away, from, the, early, idealism, that, the, artist, had, helped, found, carl, gustav, carus, later, wrote, a, series, of, articles, which, paid, tribute, to, friedrich, s, transformation, of, the, conventions, of, landscape, painting, however, carus, articles, placed, friedrich, firmly, in, his, time, and, did, not, place, the, artist, within, a, continuing, tradition, only, one, of, his, paintings, had, been, reproduced, as, a, print, and, that, was, produced, in, very, few, copies, what, the, newer, landscape, artists, see, in, a, circle, of, a, hundred, degrees, in, nature, they, press, together, unmercifully, into, an, angle, of, vision, of, only, forty, five, degrees, and, furthermore, what, is, in, nature, separated, by, large, spaces, is, compressed, into, a, cramped, space, and, overfills, and, oversatiates, the, eye, creating, an, unfavorable, and, disquieting, effect, on, the, viewer, the, visualisation, and, portrayal, of, landscape, in, an, entirely, new, manner, was, friedrich, s, key, innovation, he, sought, not, just, to, explore, the, blissful, enjoyment, of, a, beautiful, view, as, in, the, classic, conception, but, rather, to, examine, an, instant, of, sublimity, a, reunion, with, the, spiritual, self, through, the, contemplation, of, nature, friedrich, was, instrumental, in, transforming, landscape, in, art, from, a, backdrop, subordinated, to, human, drama, to, a, self, contained, emotive, subject, friedrich, s, paintings, commonly, employed, the, r, ckenfigur, a, person, seen, from, behind, contemplating, the, view, the, viewer, is, encouraged, to, place, himself, in, the, position, of, the, r, ckenfigur, by, which, means, he, experiences, the, sublime, potential, of, nature, understanding, that, the, scene, is, as, perceived, and, idealised, by, a, human, friedrich, created, the, idea, of, a, landscape, full, of, romantic, feeling, die, romantische, stimmungslandschaft, his, art, details, a, wide, range, of, geographical, features, such, as, rock, coasts, forests, and, mountain, scenes, and, often, used, landscape, to, express, religious, themes, during, his, time, most, of, the, best, known, paintings, were, viewed, as, expressions, of, a, religious, mysticism, he, wrote, the, artist, should, paint, not, only, what, he, sees, before, him, but, also, what, he, sees, within, him, if, however, he, sees, nothing, within, him, then, he, should, also, refrain, from, painting, that, which, he, sees, before, him, otherwise, his, pictures, will, be, like, those, folding, screens, behind, which, one, expects, to, find, only, the, sick, or, the, dead, expansive, skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins, and, crosses, bearing, witness, to, the, presence, of, god, are, frequent, elements, in, friedrich, s, landscapes, though, death, finds, symbolic, expression, in, boats, that, move, away, from, shore, a, charon, like, motif, and, in, the, poplar, tree, it, is, referenced, more, directly, in, paintings, like, the, abbey, in, the, oakwood, 1808, 1810, in, which, monks, carry, a, coffin, past, an, open, grave, toward, a, cross, and, through, the, portal, of, a, church, in, ruins, he, was, one, of, the, first, artists, to, portray, winter, landscapes, in, which, the, land, is, rendered, as, stark, and, dead, friedrich, s, winter, scenes, are, solemn, and, still, according, to, the, art, historian, hermann, beenken, friedrich, painted, winter, scenes, in, which, no, man, has, yet, set, his, foot, the, theme, of, nearly, all, the, older, winter, pictures, had, been, less, winter, itself, than, life, in, winter, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, it, was, thought, impossible, to, leave, out, such, motifs, as, the, crowd, of, skaters, the, wanderer, it, was, friedrich, who, first, felt, the, wholly, detached, and, distinctive, features, of, a, natural, life, instead, of, many, tones, he, sought, the, one, and, so, in, his, landscape, he, subordinated, the, composite, chord, into, one, single, basic, note, bare, oak, trees, and, tree, stumps, such, as, those, in, raven, tree, c, 1822, man, and, woman, contemplating, the, moon, c, 1824, and, willow, bush, under, a, setting, sun, c, 1835, are, recurring, elements, of, his, paintings, and, usually, symbolise, death, countering, the, sense, of, despair, are, friedrich, s, symbols, for, redemption, the, cross, and, the, clearing, sky, promise, eternal, life, and, the, slender, moon, suggests, hope, and, the, growing, closeness, of, christ, in, his, paintings, of, the, sea, anchors, often, appear, on, the, shore, also, indicating, a, spiritual, hope, in, the, abbey, in, the, oakwood, the, movement, of, the, monks, away, from, the, open, grave, and, toward, the, cross, and, the, horizon, imparts, friedrich, s, message, that, the, final, destination, of, man, s, life, lies, beyond, the, grave, with, dawn, and, dusk, constituting, prominent, themes, of, his, landscapes, friedrich, s, own, later, years, were, characterised, by, a, growing, pessimism, his, work, becomes, darker, revealing, a, fearsome, monumentality, the, wreck, of, the, hope, also, known, as, the, polar, sea, or, the, sea, of, ice, 1823, 1824, perhaps, best, summarises, friedrich, s, ideas, and, aims, at, this, point, though, in, such, a, radical, way, that, the, painting, was, not, well, received, completed, in, 1824, it, depicted, a, grim, subject, a, shipwreck, in, the, arctic, ocean, the, image, he, produced, with, its, grinding, slabs, of, travertine, colored, floe, ice, chewing, up, a, wooden, ship, goes, beyond, documentary, into, allegory, the, frail, bark, of, human, aspiration, crushed, by, the, world, s, immense, and, glacial, indifference, friedrich, s, written, commentary, on, aesthetics, was, limited, to, a, collection, of, aphorisms, set, down, in, 1830, in, which, he, explained, the, need, for, the, artist, to, match, natural, observation, with, an, introspective, scrutiny, of, his, own, personality, his, best, known, remark, advises, the, artist, to, close, your, bodily, eye, so, that, you, may, see, your, picture, first, with, the, spiritual, eye, then, bring, to, the, light, of, day, that, which, you, have, seen, in, the, darkness, so, that, it, may, react, upon, others, from, the, outside, inwards, both, friedrich, s, life, and, art, have, at, times, been, perceived, by, some, to, have, been, marked, with, an, overwhelming, sense, of, loneliness, art, historians, and, some, of, his, contemporaries, attribute, such, interpretations, to, the, losses, suffered, during, his, youth, to, the, bleak, outlook, of, his, adulthood, while, friedrich, s, pale, and, withdrawn, appearance, helped, reinforce, the, popular, notion, of, the, taciturn, man, from, the, north, friedrich, suffered, depressive, episodes, in, 1799, 1803, 1805, c, 1813, in, 1816, and, between, 1824, and, 1826, there, are, noticeable, thematic, shifts, in, the, works, he, produced, during, these, episodes, which, see, the, emergence, of, such, motifs, and, symbols, as, vultures, owls, graveyards, and, ruins, from, 1826, these, motifs, became, a, permanent, feature, of, his, output, while, his, use, of, colour, became, more, dark, and, muted, carus, wrote, in, 1829, that, friedrich, is, surrounded, by, a, thick, gloomy, cloud, of, spiritual, uncertainty, though, the, noted, art, historian, and, curator, hubertus, gassner, disagrees, with, such, notions, seeing, in, friedrich, s, work, a, positive, and, life, affirming, subtext, inspired, by, freemasonry, and, religion, reflecting, friedrich, s, patriotism, and, resentment, during, the, 1813, french, occupation, of, the, dominion, of, pomerania, motifs, from, german, folklore, became, increasingly, prominent, in,

friedrich, was, rediscovered, by, the, norwegian, art, historian, andreas, aubert, 1851, 1913, whose, writing, initiated, modern, friedrich, scholarship, and, by, the, symbolist, painters, who, valued, his, visionary, and, allegorical, landscapes, the, norwegian, symbolist, edvard, munch, 1863, 1944, would, have, seen, friedrich, s, work, during, a, visit, to, berlin, in, the, 1880s, munch,

of, dislocation, between, the, two, melancholy, figures, in, the, foreground, friedrich, s, modern, revival, gained, momentum, in, 1906, when, thirty, two, of, his, works, were, featured, in, an, exhibition, in, berlin, of, romantic, era, art, his, landscapes, exercised, a, strong, influence, on, the, work, of, german, artist, max, ernst, 1891, 1976, and, as, a, result, other, surrealists, came, to, view, friedrich, as, a, precursor, to, their, movement, in, 1934, the, belgian, painter, ren, magritte, 1898, 1967, paid, tribute, in, his, work, the, human, condition, which, directly, echoes, motifs, from, friedrich, s, art, in, its, questioning, of, perception, and, the, role, of, the, viewer, a, few, years, later, the, surrealist, journal, minotaure, included, friedrich, in, a, 1939, article, by, the, critic, marie, landsberger, thereby, exposing, his, work, to, a, far, wider, circle, of, artists, the, influence, of, the, wreck, of, hope, or, the, sea, of, ice, is, evident, in, the, 1940, 41, painting, totes, meer, by, paul, nash, 1889, 1946, a, fervent, admirer, of, ernst, friedrich, s, work, has, been, cited, as, an, inspiration, by, other, major, 20th, century, artists, including, mark, rothko, 1903, 1970, gerhard, richter, b, 1932, gotthard, graubner, and, anselm, kiefer, b, 1945, friedrich, s, romantic, paintings, have, also, been, singled, out, by, writer, samuel, beckett, 1906, 89, who, standing, before, man, and, woman, contemplating, the, moon, said, this, was, the, source, of, waiting, for, godot, you, know, in, his, 1961, article, the, abstract, sublime, originally, published, in, artnews, the, art, historian, robert, rosenblum, drew, comparisons, between, the, romantic, landscape, paintings, of, both, friedrich, and, turner, with, the, abstract, expressionist, paintings, of, mark, rothko, rosenblum, specifically, describes, friedrich, s, 1809, painting, the, monk, by, the, sea, turner, s, the, evening, star, and, rothko, s, 1954, light, earth, and, blue, as, revealing, affinities, of, vision, and, feeling, according, to, rosenblum, rothko, like, friedrich, and, turner, places, us, on, the, threshold, of, those, shapeless, infinities, discussed, by, the, aestheticians, of, the, sublime, the, tiny, monk, in, the, friedrich, and, the, fisher, in, the, turner, establish, a, poignant, contrast, between, the, infinite, vastness, of, a, pantheistic, god, and, the, infinite, smallness, of, his, creatures, in, the, abstract, language, of, rothko, such, literal, detail, a, bridge, of, empathy, between, the, real, spectator, and, the, presentation, of, a, transcendental, landscape, is, no, longer, necessary, we, ourselves, are, the, monk, before, the, sea, standing, silently, and, contemplatively, before, these, huge, and, soundless, pictures, as, if, we, were, looking, at, a, sunset, or, a, moonlit, night, until, 1890, and, especially, after, his, friends, had, died, friedrich, s, work, lay, in, near, oblivion, for, decades, yet, by, 1890, the, symbolism, in, his, work, began, to, ring, true, with, the, artistic, mood, of, the, day, especially, in, central, europe, however, despite, a, renewed, interest, and, an, acknowledgment, of, his, originality, his, lack, of, regard, for, painterly, effect, and, thinly, rendered, surfaces, jarred, with, the, theories, of, the, time, during, the, 1930s, friedrich, s, work, was, used, in, the, promotion, of, nazi, ideology, which, attempted, to, fit, the, romantic, artist, within, the, nationalistic, blut, und, boden, it, took, decades, for, friedrich, s, reputation, to, recover, from, this, association, with, nazism, his, reliance, on, symbolism, and, the, fact, that, his, work, fell, outside, the, narrow, definitions, of, modernism, contributed, to, his, fall, from, favour, in, 1949, art, historian, kenneth, clark, wrote, that, friedrich, worked, in, the, frigid, technique, of, his, time, which, could, hardly, inspire, a, school, of, modern, painting, and, suggested, that, the, artist, was, trying, to, express, in, painting, what, is, best, left, to, poetry, clark, s, dismissal, of, friedrich, reflected, the, damage, the, artist, s, reputation, sustained, during, the, late, 1930s, friedrich, s, reputation, suffered, further, damage, when, his, imagery, was, adopted, by, a, number, of, hollywood, directors, including, walt, disney, built, on, the, work, of, such, german, cinema, masters, as, fritz, lang, and, f, w, murnau, within, the, horror, and, fantasy, genres, his, rehabilitation, was, slow, but, enhanced, through, the, writings, of, such, critics, and, scholars, as, werner, hofmann, helmut, b, rsch, supan, and, sigrid, hinz, who, successfully, rebutted, the, political, associations, ascribed, to, his, work, developed, a, catalogue, raisonn, and, placed, friedrich, within, a, purely, art, historical, context, by, the, 1970s, he, was, again, being, exhibited, in, major, international, galleries, and, found, favour, with, a, new, generation, of, critics, and, art, historians, today, his, international, reputation, is, well, established, he, is, a, national, icon, in, his, native, germany, and, highly, regarded, by, art, historians, and, connoisseurs, across, the, western, world, he, is, generally, viewed, as, a, figure, of, great, psychological, complexity, and, according, to, vaughan, a, believer, who, struggled, with, doubt, a, celebrator, of, beauty, haunted, by, darkness, in, the, end, he, transcends, interpretation, reaching, across, cultures, through, the, compelling, appeal, of, his, imagery, he, has, truly, emerged, as, a, butterfly, hopefully, one, that, will, never, again, disappear, from, our, sight, friedrich, was, a, prolific, artist, who, produced, more, than, 500, attributed, works, in, line, with, the, romantic, ideals, of, his, time, he, intended, his, paintings, to, function, as, pure, aesthetic, statements, so, he, was, cautious, that, the, titles, given, to, his, work, were, not, overly, descriptive, or, evocative, it, is, likely, that, some, of, today, s, more, literal, titles, such, as, the, stages, of, life, were, not, given, by, the, artist, himself, but, were, instead, adopted, during, one, of, the, revivals, of, interest, in, friedrich, complications, arise, when, dating, friedrich, s, work, in, part, because, he, often, did, not, directly, name, or, date, his, canvases, he, kept, a, carefully, detailed, notebook, on, his, output, however, which, has, been, used, by, scholars, to, tie, paintings, to, their, completion, dates,
