through, groups, like, the, pac, s, poqo, he, believed, that, the, anc, should, form, an, armed, group, to, channel, some, of, this, violence, in, a, controlled, direction, convincing, both, anc, leader, albert, luthuli, who, was, morally, opposed, to, violence, and, allied, activist, groups, of, its, necessity, inspired, by, the, actions, of, fidel, castro, s, 26th, of, july, movement, in,

sacp, and, the, anc, after, mandela, s, death, according, to, the, sacp, he, was, not, only, a, member, of, the, party, but, also, served, on, its, central, committee, we, of, umkhonto, have, always, sought, to, achieve, liberation, without, bloodshed, and, civil, clash, even, at, this, late, hour, we, hope, that, our, first, actions, will, awaken, everyone, to, a, realization, of, the, dangerous, situation, to, which, nationalist, policy, is, leading, we, hope, that, we, will, bring, the, government, and, its, supporters, to, their, senses, before, it, is, too, late, so, that, both,

least, harmful, action, did, not, involve, killing, and, offered, the, best, hope, for, racial, reconciliation, afterwards, he, nevertheless, acknowledged, that, should, this, have, failed, then, guerrilla, warfare, might, have, been, necessary, soon, after, anc, leader, luthuli, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, mk, publicly, announced, its, existence, with, 57, bombings, on, dingane,

being, isolated, to, remove, their, influence, on, younger, activists, at, robben, island, conditions, at, pollsmoor, were, better, than, at, robben, island, although, mandela, missed, the,

movement, on, racial, lines, the, early, 1980s, witnessed, an, escalation, of, violence, across, the, country, and, many, predicted, civil, war, this, was, accompanied, by, economic, stagnation, as, various, multinational, banks, under, pressure, from, an, international, lobby, had, stopped, investing, in, south, africa, numerous, banks, and, thatcher, asked, botha, to, release, mandela, then, at, the, height, of, his, international, fame, to, defuse, the, volatile, situation, although, considering, mandela, a, dangerous, arch, marxist, botha, offered, him, in, february, 1985, a, release, from, prison, if, he, unconditionally, rejected, violence, as, a, political, weapon, mandela, spurned, the, offer, releasing, a, statement, through, his, daughter, zindzi, stating, what, freedom, am,

denied, instead, secretly, meeting, with, minister, of, justice, kobie, coetsee, in, 1987, and, having, a, further, 11, meetings, over, the, next, three, years, coetsee, organised, negotiations, between, mandela, and, a, team, of, four, government, figures, starting, in, may, 1988, the, team, agreed, to, the, release, of, political, prisoners, and, the, legalisation, of, the, anc, on, the, condition, that, they, permanently, renounce, violence, break, links, with, the, communist, party, and, not, insist, on, majority, rule, mandela, rejected, these, conditions, insisting, that, the, anc, would, end, its, armed, activities, only, when, the, government, renounced, violence, mandela, s, 70th, birthday, in, july, 1988, attracted, international, attention, including, a, tribute,

problems, when, anc, leaders, informed, him, that, winnie, had, set, herself, up, as, head, of, a, gang, the, mandela, united, football, club, which, had, been, responsible, for, torturing, and, killing, opponents, including, children, in, soweto, though, some, encouraged, him, to, divorce, her, he, decided, to, remain, loyal, until, she, was, found, guilty, by, trial, recovering, from,

a, warder, s, house, with, a, personal, cook, and, he, used, the, time, to, complete, his, llb, degree, while, there, he, was, permitted, many, visitors, and, organised, secret, communications, with,

denounce, de, klerk, as, the, head, of, an, illegitimate, discredited, minority, regime, dominated, by, the, national, party, and, anc, little, negotiation, was, achieved, codesa, 2, was, held, in,

the, conditions, that, all, political, prisoners, be, released, that, zulu, traditional, weapons, be, banned, and, that, zulu, hostels, would, be, fenced, off, de, klerk, reluctantly, agreed, the, negotiations, agreed, that, a, multiracial, general, election, would, be, held, resulting, in, a, five, year, coalition, government, of, national, unity, and, a, constitutional, assembly, that, gave, the, national, party, continuing, influence, the, anc, also, conceded, to, safeguarding, the, jobs, of, white, civil, servants, such, concessions, brought, fierce, internal, criticism, the, duo, agreed, on, an, interim, constitution, based, on, a, liberal, democratic, model, guaranteeing, separation, of, powers, creating, a, constitutional, court, and, including, a, us, style, bill, of, rights, it, also, divided, the, country, into, nine, provinces, each, with, its, own, premier, and, civil, service, a, concession, between, de, klerk, s, desire, for, federalism, and, mandela, s, for, unitary, government, the, democratic, process, was, threatened, by, the, concerned, south, africans, group, cosag, an, alliance, of, black, ethnic, secessionist, groups, like, inkatha, and, far, right, afrikaner, parties, in, june, 1993, one, of, the, latter, the, afrikaner, weerstandsbeweging, awb, attacked, the, kempton, park, world, trade, centre, following, the, murder, of, anc, activist,

mandela, and, de, klerk, visited, the, united, states, independently, meeting, president, bill, clinton, and, each, receiving, the, liberty, medal, soon, after, mandela, and, de, klerk, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, norway, influenced, by, thabo, mbeki, mandela, began, meeting, with, big, business, figures, and, he, played, down, his, support, for, nationalisation, fearing, that, he, would, scare, away, much, needed, foreign, investment, although, criticised, by, socialist, anc, members, he, had, been, encouraged, to, embrace, private, enterprise, by, members, of, the, chinese, and, vietnamese, communist, parties, at, the, january, 1992, world, economic, forum, in, switzerland, with, the, election, set, for, 27, april, 1994, the, anc, began, campaigning, opening, 100, election, offices, and, orchestrating, people, s, forums, across, the, country, at, which, mandela, could, appear, as, a, popular, figure, with, great, status, among, black, south, africans, the, anc, campaigned, on, a, reconstruction, and, development, programme, rdp, to, build, a, million, houses, in, five, years, introduce, universal, free, education, and, extend, access, to, water, and, electricity, the, party, s, slogan, was, a, better, life, for, all, although, it, was, not, explained, how, this, development, would, be, funded, with, the, exception, of, the, weekly, mail, and, the, new, nation, south, africa, s, press, opposed, mandela, s, election, fearing, continued, ethnic, strife, instead, supporting, the, national, or, democratic, party, mandela, devoted, much, time, to, fundraising, for, the, anc, touring, north, america, europe, and, asia, to, meet, wealthy, donors, including, former, supporters, of, the, apartheid, regime, he, also, urged, a, reduction, in, the, voting, age, from, 18, to, 14, rejected, by, the, anc, this, policy, became, the, subject, of, ridicule, concerned, that, cosag, would, undermine, the, election, particularly, in, the, wake, of, the, conflict, in, bophuthatswana, and, the, shell, house, massacre, incidents, of, violence, involving, the, awb, and, inkatha, respectively, mandela, met, with, afrikaner, politicians, and, generals, including, p, w, botha, pik, botha, and, constand, viljoen, persuading, many, to, work, within, the, democratic, system, with, de, klerk, he, also, convinced, inkatha, s, buthelezi, to, enter, the, elections, rather, than, launch, a, war, of, secession, as, leaders, of, the, two, major, parties, de, klerk, and, mandela, appeared, on, a, televised, debate, mandela, s, offer, to, shake, his, hand, surprised, him, leading, some, commentators, to, deem, it, a, victory, for, mandela, the, election, went, ahead, with, little, violence, although, an, awb, cell, killed, 20, with, car, bombs, as, widely, expected, the, anc, won, a, sweeping, victory, taking, 63, of, the, vote, just, short, of, the, two, thirds, majority, needed, to, unilaterally, change, the, constitution, the, anc, was, also, victorious, in, seven, provinces, with, inkatha, and, the, national, party, each, taking, one, mandela, voted, at, the, ohlange, high, school, in, durban, and, though, the, anc, s, victory, assured, his, election, as, president, he, publicly, accepted, that, the, election, had, been, marred, by, instances, of, fraud, and, sabotage, the, newly, elected, national, assembly, s, first, act, was, to, formally, elect, mandela, as, south, africa, s, first, black, chief, executive, his, inauguration, took, place, in, pretoria, on, 10, may, 1994, televised, to, a, billion, viewers, globally, the, event, was, attended, by, four, thousand, guests, including, world, leaders, from, a, wide, range, of, geographic, and, ideological, backgrounds, mandela, headed, a, government, of, national, unity, dominated, by, the, anc, which, had, no, experience, of, governing, by, itself, but, containing, representatives, from, the, national, party, and, inkatha, under, the, interim, constitution, inkatha, and, the, national, party, were, entitled, to, seats, in, the, government, by, virtue, of, winning, at, least, 20, seats, in, keeping, with, earlier, agreements, both, de, klerk, and, thabo, mbeki, were, given, the, position, of, deputy, president, although, mbeki, had, not, been, his, first, choice, for, the, job, mandela, grew, to, rely, heavily, on, him, throughout, his, presidency, allowing, him, to, shape, policy, details, moving, into, the, presidential, office, at, tuynhuys, in, cape, town, mandela, allowed, de, klerk, to, retain, the, presidential, residence, in, the, groote, schuur, estate, instead, settling, into, the, nearby, westbrooke, manor, which, he, renamed, genadendal, meaning, valley, of, mercy, in, afrikaans, retaining, his, houghton, home, he, also, had, a, house, built, in, his, home, village, of, qunu, which, he, visited, regularly, meeting, with, locals, and, judging, tribal, disputes, aged, 76, he, faced, various, ailments, and, although, exhibiting, continued, energy, he, felt, isolated, and, lonely, he, often, entertained, celebrities, such, as, michael, jackson, whoopi, goldberg, and, the, spice, girls, and, befriended, ultra, rich, businessmen, like, harry, oppenheimer, of, anglo, american, he, also, met, with, queen, elizabeth, ii, on, her, march, 1995, state, visit, to, south, africa, which, earned, him, strong, criticism, from, anc, anti, capitalists, despite, his, opulent, surroundings, mandela, lived, simply, donating, a, third, of, his, r, 552, 000, annual, income, to, the, nelson, mandela, children, s, fund, which, he, had, founded, in, 1995, although, dismantling, press, censorship, speaking, out, in, favour, of, freedom, of, the, press, and, befriending, many, journalists, mandela, was, critical, of, much, of, the, country, s, media, noting, that, it, was, overwhelmingly, owned, and, run, by, middle, class, whites, and, believing, that, it, focused, too, heavily, on, scaremongering, about, crime, in, december, 1994, mandela, published, long, walk, to, freedom, an, autobiography, based, around, a, manuscript, he, had, written, in, prison, augmented, by, interviews, conducted, with, american, journalist, richard, stengel, in, late, 1994, he, attended, the, 49th, conference, of, the, anc, in, bloemfontein, at, which, a, more, militant, national, executive, was, elected, among, them, winnie, mandela, although, she, expressed, an, interest, in, reconciling, nelson, initiated, divorce, proceedings, in, august, 1995, by, 1995, he, had, entered, into, a, relationship, with, gra, a, machel, a, mozambican, political, activist, 27, years, his, junior, who, was, the, widow, of, former, president, samora, machel, they, had, first, met, in, july, 1990, when, she, was, still, in, mourning, but, their, friendship, grew, into, a, partnership, with, machel, accompanying, him, on, many, of, his, foreign, visits, she, turned, down, mandela, s, first, marriage, proposal, wanting, to, retain, some, independence, and, dividing, her, time, between, mozambique, and, johannesburg, gracious, but, steely, steered, a, country, in, turmoil, toward, a, negotiated, settlement, a, country, that, days, before, its, first, democratic, election, remained, violent, riven, by, divisive, views, and, personalities, he, endorsed, national, reconciliation, an, idea, he, did, not, merely, foster, in, the, abstract, but, performed, with, panache, and, conviction, in, reaching, out, to, former, adversaries, he, initiated, an, era, of, hope, that, while, not, long, lasting, was, nevertheless, decisive, and, he, garnered, the, highest, international, recognition, and, affection, rita, barnard, the, cambridge, companion, to, nelson, mandela, presiding, over, the, transition, from, apartheid, minority, rule, to, a, multicultural, democracy, mandela, saw, national, reconciliation, as, the, primary, task, of, his, presidency, having, seen, other, post, colonial, african, economies, damaged, by, the, departure, of, white, elites, mandela, worked, to, reassure, south, africa, s, white, population, that, they, were, protected, and, represented, in, the, rainbow, nation, although, his, government, of, national, unity, would, be, dominated, by, the, anc, he, attempted, to, create, a, broad, coalition, by, appointing, de, klerk, as, deputy, president, and, appointing, other, national, party, officials, as, ministers, for, agriculture, environment, and, minerals, and, energy, as, well, as, naming, buthelezi, as, minister, for, home, affairs, the, other, cabinet, positions, were, taken, by, anc, members, many, of, whom, like, joe, modise, alfred, nzo, joe, slovo, mac, maharaj, and, dullah, omar, had, long, been, comrades, of, mandela, although, others, such, as, tito, mboweni, and, jeff, radebe, were, far, younger, mandela, s, relationship, with, de, klerk, was, strained, mandela, thought, that, de, klerk, was, intentionally, provocative, and, de, klerk, felt, that, he, was, being, intentionally, humiliated, by, the, president, in, january, 1995, mandela, heavily, chastised, de, klerk, for, awarding, amnesty, to, 3, 500, police, officers, just, before, the, election, and, later, criticised, him, for, defending, former, minister, of, defence, magnus, malan, when, the, latter, was, charged, with, murder, mandela, personally, met, with, senior, figures, of, the, apartheid, regime, including, lawyer, percy, yutar, and, hendrik, verwoerd, s, widow, betsie, schoombie, also, laying, a, wreath, by, the, statue, of, afrikaner, hero, daniel, theron, emphasising, personal, forgiveness, and, reconciliation, he, announced, that, courageous, people, do, not, fear, forgiving, for, the, sake, of, peace, he, encouraged, black, south, africans, to, get, behind, the, previously, hated, national, rugby, team, the, springboks, as, south, africa, hosted, the, 1995, rugby, world, cup, mandela, wore, a, springbok, shirt, at, the, final, against, new, zealand, and, after, the, springboks, won, the, match, mandela, presented, the, trophy, to, captain, francois, pienaar, an, afrikaner, this, was, widely, seen, as, a, major, step, in, the, reconciliation, of, white, and, black, south, africans, as, de, klerk, later, put, it, mandela, won, the, hearts, of, millions, of, white, rugby, fans, mandela, s, efforts, at, reconciliation, assuaged, the, fears, of, white, people, but, also, drew, criticism, from, more, militant, black, people, among, the, latter, was, his, estranged, wife, winnie, who, accused, the, anc, of, being, more, interested, in, appeasing, the, white, community, than, in, helping, the, black, majority, mandela, oversaw, the, formation, of, a, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, to, investigate, crimes, committed, under, apartheid, by, both, the, government, and, the, anc, appointing, tutu, as, its, chair, to, prevent, the, creation, of, martyrs, the, commission, granted, individual, amnesties, in, exchange, for, testimony, of, crimes, committed, during, the, apartheid, era, dedicated, in, february, 1996, it, held, two, years, of, hearings, detailing, rapes, torture, bombings, and, assassinations, before, issuing, its, final, report, in, october, 1998, both, de, klerk, and, mbeki, appealed, to, have, parts, of, the, report, suppressed, though, only, de, klerk, s, appeal, was, successful, mandela, praised, the, commission, s, work, stating, that, it, had, helped, us, move, away, from, the, past, to, concentrate, on, the, present, and, the, future, mandela, s, administration, inherited, a, country, with, a, huge, disparity, in, wealth, and, services, between, white, and, black, communities, of, a, population, of, 40, million, around, 23, million, lacked, electricity, or, adequate, sanitation, and, 12, million, lacked, clean, water, supplies, with, 2, million, children, not, in, school, and, a, third, of, the, population, illiterate, there, was, 33, unemployment, and, just, under, half, of, the, population, lived, below, the, poverty, line, government, financial, reserves, were, nearly, depleted, with, a, fifth, of, the, national, budget, being, spent, on, debt, repayment, meaning, that, the, extent, of, the, promised, reconstruction, and, development, programme, rdp, was, scaled, back, with, none, of, the, proposed, nationalisation, or, job, creation, in, 1996, the, rdp, was, replaced, with, a, new, policy, growth, employment, and, redistribution, gear, which, maintained, south, africa, s, mixed, economy, but, placed, an, emphasis, on, economic, growth, through, a, framework, of, market, economics, and, the, encouragement, of, foreign, investment, many, in, the, anc, derided, it, as, a, neo, liberal, policy, that, did, not, address, social, inequality, no, matter, how, mandela, defended, it, in, adopting, this, approach, mandela, s, government, adhered, to, the, washington, consensus, advocated, by, the, world, bank, and, international, monetary, fund, under, mandela, s, presidency, welfare, spending, increased, by, 13, in, 1996, 97, 13, in, 1997, 98, and, 7, in, 1998, 99, the, government, introduced, parity, in, grants, for, communities, including, disability, grants, child, maintenance, grants, and, old, age, pensions, which, had, previously, been, set, at, different, levels, for, south, africa, s, different, racial, groups, in, 1994, free, healthcare, was, introduced, for, children, under, six, and, pregnant, women, a, provision, extended, to, all, those, using, primary, level, public, sector, health, care, services, in, 1996, by, the, 1999, election, the, anc, could, boast, that, due, to, their, policies, 3, million, people, were, connected, to, telephone, lines, 1, 5, million, children, were, brought, into, the, education, system, 500, clinics, were, upgraded, or, constructed, 2, million, people, were, connected, to, the, electricity, grid, water, access, was, extended, to, 3, million, people, and, 750, 000, houses, were, constructed, housing, nearly, 3, million, people, the, land, reform, act, 3, of, 1996, safeguarded, the, rights, of, labour, tenants, living, on, farms, where, they, grew, crops, or, grazed, livestock, this, legislation, ensured, that, such, tenants, could, not, be, evicted, without, a, court, order, or, if, they, were, over, the, age, of, 65, recognising, that, arms, manufacturing, was, a, key, industry, for, the, south, african, economy, mandela, endorsed, the, trade, in, weapons, but, brought, in, tighter, regulations, surrounding, armscor, to, ensure, that, south, african, weaponry, was, not, sold, to, authoritarian, regimes, under, mandela, s, administration, tourism, was, increasingly, promoted, becoming, a, major, sector, of, the, south, african, economy, critics, like, edwin, cameron, accused, mandela, s, government, of, doing, little, to, stem, the, hiv, aids, pandemic, in, the, country, by, 1999, 10, of, south, africa, s, population, were, hiv, positive, mandela, later, admitted, that, he, had, personally, neglected, the, issue, in, part, due, to, public, reticence, in, discussing, issues, surrounding, sex, in, south, africa, and, that, he, had, instead, left, the, issue, for, mbeki, to, deal, with, mandela, also, received, criticism, for, failing, to, sufficiently, combat, crime, south, africa, had, one, of, the, world, s, highest, crime, rates, and, the, activities, of, international, crime, syndicates, in, the, country, grew, significantly, throughout, the, decade, mandela, s, administration, was, also, perceived, as, having, failed, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, corruption, further, problems, were, caused, by, the, exodus, of, thousands, of, skilled, white, south, africans, from, the, country, who, were, escaping, the, increasing, crime, rates, higher, taxes, and, the, impact, of, positive, discrimination, toward, black, people, in, employment, this, exodus, resulted, in, a, brain, drain, and, mandela, criticised, those, who, left, at, the, same, time, south, africa, experienced, an, influx, of, millions, of, illegal, migrants, from, poorer, parts, of, africa, although, public, opinion, toward, these, illegal, immigrants, was, generally, unfavourable, characterising, them, as, disease, spreading, criminals, who, were, a, drain, on, resources, mandela, called, on, south, africans, to, embrace, them, as, brothers, and, sisters, mandela, expressed, the, view, that, south, africa, s, future, foreign, relations, be, based, on, our, belief, that, human, rights, should, be, the, core, of, international, relations, following, the, south, african, example, mandela, encouraged, other, nations, to, resolve, conflicts, through, diplomacy, and, reconciliation, in, september, 1998,

in, 1999, expressing, satisfaction, with, his, performance, as, president, retiring, in, june, 1999, mandela, aimed, to, lead, a, quiet, family, life, divided, between, johannesburg, and, qunu,

support, the, anc, usually, overshadowing, mbeki, at, any, public, events, that, the, two, attended, mandela, was, more, at, ease, with, mbeki, s, successor, zuma, although, the, nelson, mandela, foundation, was, upset, when, his, grandson, mandla, mandela, flew, him, out, to, the, eastern, cape, to, attend, a, pro, zuma, rally, in, the, midst, of, a, storm, in, 2009, in, 2004, mandela,

benefit, of, his, descendants, in, mid, 2013, as, mandela, was, hospitalised, for, a, lung, infection, in, pretoria, his, descendants, were, involved, in, an, intra, family, legal, dispute, relating,

following, day, in, september, 2013, mandela, was, discharged, from, hospital, although, his, condition, remained, unstable, after, suffering, from, a, prolonged, respiratory, infection, mandela, died, on, 5, december, 2013, at, the, age, of, 95, at, around, 20, 50, local, time, at, his, home, in, houghton, surrounded, by, his, family, zuma, publicly, announced, his, death, on, television,

representatives, of, foreign, states, travelled, to, south, africa, to, attend, memorial, events, it, was, later, revealed, that, 300, million, rand, about, 20, million, dollars, originally, earmarked, for, humanitarian, development, projects, had, been, redirected, to, finance, the, funeral, the, media, was, awash, with, tributes, and, reminiscences, while, images, of, tributes, to, mandela, proliferated, across, social, media, his, us, 4, 1, million, estate, was, left, to, his, widow, other, family, members, staff, and, educational, institutions, a, friend, once, asked, me, how, i, could, reconcile, my, creed, of, african, nationalism, with, a, belief, in, dialectical, materialism, for, me, there, was, no, contradiction, i, was, first, and, foremost, an, african, nationalist, fighting, for, our, emancipation, from, minority, rule, and, the, right, to, control, our, own, destiny, but, at, the, same, time, south, africa, and, the, african, continent, were, part, of, the, larger, world, our, problems, while, distinctive, and, special, were, not, unique, and, a, philosophy, that, placed, those, problems, in, an, international, and, historical, context, of, the, greater, world, and, the, course, of, history, was, valuable, i, was, prepared, to, use, whatever, means, necessary, to, speed, up, the, erasure, of, human, prejudice, and, the, end, of, chauvinistic, and, violent, nationalism, nelson, mandela, 1994, mandela, identified, as, both, an, african, nationalist, an, ideological, position, he, held, since, joining, the, anc, and, as, a, socialist, he, was, a, practical, politician, rather, than, an, intellectual, scholar, or, political, theorist, according, to, biographer, tom, lodge, for, mandela, politics, has, always, been, primarily, about, enacting, stories, about, making, narratives, primarily, about, morally, exemplary, conduct, and, only, secondarily, about, ideological, vision, more, about, means, rather, than, ends, the, historian, sabelo, j, ndlovu, gatsheni, described, mandela, as, a, liberal, african, nationalist, decolonial, humanist, while, political, analyst, raymond, suttner, cautioned, against, labelling, mandela, a, liberal, and, stated, that, mandela, displayed, a, hybrid, socio, political, make, up, mandela, adopted, some, of, his, political, ideas, from, other, thinkers, among, them, indian, independence, leaders, like, gandhi, and, nehru, african, american, civil, rights, activists, and, african, nationalists, like, nkrumah, and, applied, them, to, the, south, african, situation, at, the, same, time, he, rejected, other, aspects, of, their, thought, such, as, the, anti, white, sentiment, of, many, african, nationalists, in, doing, so, he, synthesised, both, counter, cultural, and, hegemonic, views, for, instance, by, drawing, upon, ideas, from, the, then, dominant, afrikaner, nationalism, in, promoting, his, anti, apartheid, vision, his, political, development, was, strongly, influenced, by, his, legal, training, and, practice, in, particular, his, hope, to, achieve, change, not, through, violence, but, through, legal, revolution, over, the, course, of, his, life, he, began, by, advocating, a, path, of, non, violence, later, embracing, violence, and, then, adopting, a, non, violent, approach, to, negotiation, and, reconciliation, when, endorsing, violence, he, did, so, because, he, saw, no, alternative, and, was, always, pragmatic, about, it, perceiving, it, as, a, means, to, get, his, opponent, to, the, negotiating, table, he, sought, to, target, symbols, of, white, supremacy, and, racist, oppression, rather, than, white, people, as, individuals, and, was, anxious, not, to, inaugurate, a, race, war, in, south, africa, this, willingness, to, use, violence, distinguishes, mandela, from, the, ideology, of, gandhism, with, which, some, commentators, have, sought, to, associate, him, although, he, presented, himself, in, an, autocratic, manner, in, several, speeches, mandela, was, a, devout, believer, in, democracy, and, abided, by, majority, decisions, even, when, deeply, disagreeing, with, them, he, had, exhibited, a, commitment, to, the, values, of, democracy, and, human, rights, since, at, least, the, 1960s, he, held, a, conviction, that, inclusivity, accountability, and, freedom, of, speech, were, the, fundamentals, of, democracy, and, was, driven, by, a, belief, in, natural, and, human, rights, suttner, argued, that, there, were, two, modes, of, leadership, that, mandela, adopted, on, one, side, he, adhered, to, ideas, about, collective, leadership, although, on, the, other, believed, that, there, were, scenarios, in, which, a, leader, had, to, be, decisive, and, act, without, consultation, to, achieve, a, particular, objective, according, to, lodge, mandela, s, political, thought, reflected, tensions, between, his, support, for, liberal, democracy, and, pre, colonial, african, forms, of, consensus, decision, making, he, was, an, admirer, of, british, style, parliamentary, democracy, stating, that, i, regard, the, british, parliament, as, the, most, democratic, institution, in, the, world, and, the, independence, and, impartiality, of, its, judiciary, never, fail, to, arouse, my, admiration, in, this, he, has, been, described, as, being, committed, to, the, euro, north, american, modernist, project, of, emancipation, something, which, distinguishes, him, from, other, african, nationalist, and, socialist, leaders, like, nyerere, who, were, concerned, about, embracing, styles, of, democratic, governance, that, were, western, rather, than, african, in, origin, mandela, nevertheless, also, expressed, admiration, for, what, he, deemed, to, be, indigenous, forms, of, democracy, describing, xhosa, traditional, society, s, mode, of, governance, as, democracy, in, its, purest, form, mandela, advocated, the, ultimate, establishment, of, a, classless, society, with, sampson, describing, him, as, being, openly, opposed, to, capitalism, private, land, ownership, and, the, power, of, big, money, mandela, was, influenced, by, marxism, and, during, the, revolution, he, advocated, scientific, socialism, he, denied, being, a, communist, at, the, treason, trial, and, maintained, this, stance, both, when, later, talking, to, journalists, and, in, his, autobiography, where, he, outlined, that, the, cooperation, with, the, sacp, was, pragmatic, asking, rhetorically, who, is, to, say, that, we, were, not, using, them, according, to, the, sociologist, craig, soudien, sympathetic, as, mandela, was, to, socialism, a, communist, he, was, not, conversely, the, biographer, david, jones, smith, stated, that, mandela, embraced, communism, and, communists, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, while, the, historian, stephen, ellis, commented, that, mandela, had, assimilated, much, of, the, marxist, leninist, ideology, by, 1960, ellis, also, found, evidence, that, mandela, had, been, an, active, member, of, the, south, african, communist, party, sacp, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, something, that, was, confirmed, after, his, death, by, both, the, anc, and, the, sacp, the, latter, of, which, claimed, that, he, was, not, only, a, member, of, the, party, but, also, served, on, its, central, committee, his, membership, had, been, hidden, by, the, anc, aware, that, knowledge, of, mandela, s, former, sacp, involvement, might, have, been, detrimental, to, his, attempts, to, attract, support, from, western, countries, mandela, s, view, of, these, western, governments, differed, from, those, of, marxist, leninists, for, he, did, not, believe, that, they, were, anti, democratic, or, reactionary, and, remained, committed, to, democratic, systems, of, governance, the, 1955, freedom, charter, which, mandela, had, helped, create, called, for, the, nationalisation, of, banks, gold, mines, and, land, to, ensure, equal, distribution, of, wealth, despite, these, beliefs, mandela, initiated, a, programme, of, privatisation, during, his, presidency, in, line, with, trends, in, other, countries, of, the, time, it, has, been, repeatedly, suggested, that, mandela, would, have, preferred, to, develop, a, social, democratic, economy, in, south, africa, but, that, this, was, not, feasible, as, a, result, of, the, international, political, and, economic, situation, during, the, early, 1990s, this, decision, was, in, part, influenced, by, the, fall, of, the, socialist, states, in, the, soviet, union, and, eastern, bloc, during, the, early, 1990s, mandela, was, widely, considered, a, charismatic, leader, described, by, biographer, mary, benson, as, a, born, mass, leader, who, could, not, help, magnetizing, people, he, was, highly, image, conscious, and, throughout, his, life, always, sought, out, fine, quality, clothes, with, many, commentators, believing, that, he, carried, himself, in, a, regal, manner, his, aristocratic, heritage, was, repeatedly, emphasised, by, supporters, thus, contributing, to, his, charismatic, power, while, living, in, johannesburg, in, the, 1950s, he, cultivated, the, image, of, the, african, gentleman, having, the, pressed, clothes, correct, manners, and, modulated, public, speech, associated, with, such, a, position, in, doing, so, lodge, argued, that, mandela, became, one, of, the, first, media, politicians, embodying, a, glamour, and, a, style, that, projected, visually, a, brave, new, african, world, of, modernity, and, freedom, mandela, was, known, to, change, his, clothes, several, times, a, day, and, he, became, so, associated, with, highly, coloured, batik, shirts, after, assuming, the, presidency, that, they, came, to, be, known, as, madiba, shirts, for, political, scientists, betty, glad, and, robert, blanton, mandela, was, an, exceptionally, intelligent, shrewd, and, loyal, leader, his, official, biographer, anthony, sampson, commented, that, he, was, a, master, of, imagery, and, performance, excelling, at, presenting, himself, well, in, press, photographs, and, producing, sound, bites, his, public, speeches, were, presented, in, a, formal, stiff, manner, and, often, consisted, of, clich, d, set, phrases, he, typically, spoke, slowly, and, carefully, chose, his, words, although, he, was, not, considered, a, great, orator, his, speeches, conveyed, his, personal, commitment, charm, and, humour, mandela, was, a, private, person, who, often, concealed, his, emotions, and, confided, in, very, few, people, privately, he, lived, an, austere, life, refusing, to, drink, alcohol, or, smoke, and, even, as, president, made, his, own, bed, renowned, for, his, mischievous, sense, of, humour, he, was, known, for, being, both, stubborn, and, loyal, and, at, times, exhibited, a, quick, temper, he, was, typically, friendly, and, welcoming, and, appeared, relaxed, in, conversation, with, everyone, including, his, opponents, a, self, described, anglophile, he, claimed, to, have, lived, by, the, trappings, of, british, style, and, manners, constantly, polite, and, courteous, he, was, attentive, to, all, irrespective, of, their, age, or, status, and, often, talked, to, children, or, servants, he, was, known, for, his, ability, to, find, common, ground, with, very, different, communities, in, later, life, he, always, looked, for, the, best, in, people, even, defending, political, opponents, to, his, allies, who, sometimes, thought, him, too, trusting, of, others, he, was, fond, of, indian, cuisine, and, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, archaeology, and, boxing, the, significance, of, mandela, can, be, considered, in, two, related, ways, first, he, has, provided, through, his, personal, presence, as, a, benign, and,
