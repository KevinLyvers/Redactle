and, map, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, and, the, shores, of, the, saint, lawrence, river, which, he, named, the, country, of, canadas, after, the, iroquoian, names, for, the, two, big, settlements, he, saw, at, stadacona, quebec, city, and, at, hochelaga, montreal, island, jacques, cartier, was, born, in, 1491, in, saint, malo, the, port, on, the, north, east, coast, of, brittany, cartier, who, was, a, respectable, mariner, improved, his, social, status, in, 1520, by, marrying, mary, catherine, des, granches, member, of, a, leading, aristocratic, family, his, good, name, in, saint, malo, is, recognized, by, its, frequent, appearance, in, baptismal, registers, as, godfather, or, witness, in, 1534, two, years, after, the, duchy, of, brittany, was, formally, united, with, france, in, the, edict, of, union, cartier, was, introduced, to, king, francis, i, by, jean, le, veneur, bishop, of, saint, malo, and, abbot, of, mont, saint, michel, at, the, manoir, de, brion, the, king, had, previously, invited, although, not, formally, commissioned, the, florentine, explorer, giovanni, da, verrazzano, to, explore, the, eastern, coast, of, north, america, on, behalf, of, france, in, 1524, le, veneur, cited, voyages, to, newfoundland, and, brazil, as, proof, of, cartier, s, ability, to, lead, ships, to, the, discovery, of, new, lands, in, the, new, world, on, april, 20, 1534, cartier, set, sail, under, a, commission, from, the, king, hoping, to, discover, a, western, passage, to, the, wealthy, markets, of, asia, in, the, words, of, the, commission, he, was, to, discover, certain, islands, and, lands, where, it, is, said, that, a, great, quantity, of, gold, and, other, precious, things, are, to, be, found, it, took, him, twenty, days, to, sail, across, the, ocean, starting, on, may, 10, of, that, year, he, explored, parts, of, newfoundland, the, strait, of, belle, isle, and, southern, shore, of, the, labrador, peninsula, the, gasp, and, north, shore, coastlines, on, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, and, some, parts, of, the, coasts, of, the, gulf, s, main, islands, including, prince, edward, island, anticosti, island, and, the, magdalen, islands, during, one, stop, at, les, aux, oiseaux, islands, of, the, birds, now, the, rochers, aux, oiseaux, federal, bird, sanctuary, northeast, of, brion, island, in, the, magdalen, islands, his, crew, slaughtered, around, 1000, birds, most, of, them, great, auks, extinct, since, 1852, cartier, s, first, two, encounters, with, aboriginal, peoples, in, canada, on, the, north, side, of, chaleur, bay, most, likely, the, mi, kmaq, were, brief, some, trading, occurred, his, third, encounter, took, place, on, the, shores, of, gasp, bay, with, a, party, of, st, lawrence, iroquoians, where, on, july, 24, he, planted, a, cross, to, claim, the, land, for, france, the, 10, metre, cross, bearing, the, words, long, live, the, king, of, france, claimed, possession, of, the, territory, in, the, king, s, name, the, change, in, mood, was, a, clear, indication, that, the, iroquoians, understood, cartier, s, actions, here, he, kidnapped, the, two, sons, of, their, chief, donnacona, cartier, wrote, that, they, later, told, him, this, region, where, they, were, captured, gasp, was, called, by, them, honguedo, the, natives, chief, at, last, agreed, that, they, could, be, taken, under, the, condition, that, they, return, with, european, goods, to, trade, cartier, returned, to, france, in, september, 1534, sure, that, he, had, reached, an, asian, land, jacques, cartier, set, sail, for, a, second, voyage, on, may, 19, of, the, following, year, with, three, ships, 110, men, and, his, two, iroquoian, captives, reaching, the, st, lawrence, he, sailed, upriver, for, the, first, time, and, reached, the, iroquoian, capital, of, stadacona, where, chief, donnacona, ruled, cartier, claimed, a, land, near, st, lawrence, river, in, 1534, but, france, paid, little, attention, to, the, colony, for, 60, years, not, until, king, henry, iv, sent, samuel, de, champlain, in, 1608, to, new, france, as, its, governor, and, built, a, permanent, settlement, and, a, fur, trading, post, called, quebec, cartier, left, his, main, ships, in, a, harbour, close, to, stadacona, and, used, his, smallest, ship, to, continue, on, to, hochelaga, now, montreal, arriving, on, october, 2, 1535, hochelaga, was, far, more, impressive, than, the, small, and, squalid, village, of, stadacona, and, a, crowd, of, over, a, thousand, came, to, the, river, s, edge, to, greet, the, frenchmen, the, site, of, their, arrival, has, been, confidently, identified, as, the, beginning, of, the, sainte, marie, sault, where, the, bridge, named, after, him, now, stands, the, expedition, could, proceed, no, further, as, the, river, was, blocked, by, rapids, so, certain, was, cartier, that, the, river, was, the, northwest, passage, and, that, the, rapids, were, all, that, was, preventing, him, from, sailing, to, china, that, the, rapids, and, the, town, that, eventually, grew, near, them, came, to, be, named, after, the, french, word, for, china, la, chine, the, lachine, rapids, and, the, town, of, lachine, quebec, after, spending, two, days, among, the, people, of, hochelaga, cartier, returned, to, stadacona, on, october, 11, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, he, decided, to, spend, the, winter, of, 1535, 1536, in, stadacona, and, it, was, by, then, too, late, to, return, to, france, cartier, and, his, men, prepared, for, the, winter, by, strengthening, their, fort, stacking, firewood, and, salting, down, game, and, fish, from, mid, november, 1535, to, mid, april, 1536, the, french, fleet, lay, frozen, solid, at, the, mouth, of, the, st, charles, river, under, the, rock, of, quebec, ice, was, over, a, fathom, 1, 8, m, thick, on, the, river, with, snow, four, feet, 1, 2, m, deep, ashore, to, add, to, the, misery, scurvy, broke, out, first, among, the, iroquoians, and, then, among, the, french, cartier, estimated, the, number, of, dead, iroquoians, at, 50, on, a, visit, by, domagaya, to, the, french, fort, cartier, inquired, and, learned, from, him, that, a, concoction, made, from, a, tree, known, as, annedda, probably, spruce, beer, or, arbor, vitae, would, cure, scurvy, this, remedy, likely, saved, the, expedition, from, destruction, allowing, 85, frenchmen, to, survive, the, winter, in, his, journal, cartier, states, that, by, mid, february, out, of, 110, that, we, were, not, ten, were, well, enough, to, help, the, others, a, pitiful, thing, to, see, the, frenchmen, used, up, the, bark, of, an, entire, tree, in, a, week, on, the, cure, and, the, dramatic, results, prompted, cartier, to, proclaim, it, a, godsend, and, a, miracle, ready, to, return, to, france, in, early, may, 1536, cartier, decided, to, kidnap, chief, donnacona, and, take, him, to, france, so, that, he, might, personally, tell, the, tale, of, a, country, further, north, called, the, kingdom, of, saguenay, said, to, be, full, of, gold, rubies, and, other, treasures, after, an, arduous, trip, down, the, st, lawrence, and, a, three, week, atlantic, crossing, cartier, and, his, men, arrived, in, saint, malo, on, july, 15, 1536, concluding, the, second, 14, month, voyage, which, was, to, be, cartier, s, most, profitable, on, october, 17, 1540, francis, ordered, the, navigator, jacques, cartier, to, return, to, canada, to, lend, weight, to, a, colonization, project, of, which, he, would, be, captain, general, however, january, 15, 1541, saw, cartier, supplanted, by, jean, fran, ois, de, la, rocque, de, roberval, a, huguenot, courtier, and, friend, of, the, king, named, as, the, first, lieutenant, general, of, french, canada, roberval, was, to, lead, the, expedition, with, cartier, as, his, chief, navigator, while, roberval, waited, for, artillery, and, supplies, he, gave, permission, to, cartier, to, sail, on, ahead, with, his, ships, on, may, 23, 1541, cartier, departed, saint, malo, on, his, third, voyage, with, five, ships, this, time, any, thought, of, finding, a, passage, to, the, orient, was, forgotten, the, goals, were, now, to, find, the, kingdom, of, saguenay, and, its, riches, and, to, establish, a, permanent, settlement, along, the, st, lawrence, river, anchoring, at, stadacona, cartier, again, met, the, iroquoians, but, found, their, show, of, joy, and, their, numbers, worrisome, and, decided, not, to, build, his, settlement, there, sailing, a, few, kilometres, upriver, to, a, spot, he, had, previously, observed, he, decided, to, settle, on, the, site, of, present, day, cap, rouge, quebec, the, convicts, and, other, colonists, were, landed, the, cattle, that, had, survived, three, months, aboard, ship, were, turned, loose, earth, was, broken, for, a, kitchen, garden, and, seeds, of, cabbage, turnip, and, lettuce, were, planted, a, fortified, settlement, was, thus, created, and, was, named, charlesbourg, royal, another, fort, was, also, built, on, the, cliff, overlooking, the, settlement, for, added, protection, the, men, also, began, collecting, what, they, believed, to, be, diamonds, and, gold, but, which, upon, return, to, france, were, discovered, to, be, merely, quartz, crystals, and, iron, pyrites, respectively, which, gave, rise, to, a, french, expression, faux, comme, les, diamants, du, canada, as, false, as, canadian, diamonds, two, of, the, ships, were, sent, on, their, journey, home, with, some, of, these, minerals, on, september, 2, having, set, tasks, for, everyone, cartier, left, with, the, longboats, for, a, reconnaissance, in, search, of, saguenay, on, september, 7, having, reached, hochelaga, he, was, prevented, by, bad, weather, and, the, numerous, rapids, from, continuing, up, to, the, ottawa, river, returning, to, charlesbourg, royal, cartier, found, the, situation, ominous, the, iroquoians, no, longer, made, friendly, visits, or, peddled, fish, and, game, but, prowled, about, in, a, sinister, manner, no, records, exist, about, the, winter, of, 1541, 1542, and, the, information, must, be, gleaned, from, the, few, details, provided, by, returning, sailors, it, seems, the, natives, attacked, and, killed, about, 35, settlers, before, the, frenchmen, could, retreat, behind, their, fortifications, even, though, scurvy, was, cured, through, the, native, remedy, thuja, occidentalis, infusion, the, impression, left, is, of, a, general, misery, and, of, cartier, s, growing, conviction, that, he, had, insufficient, manpower, either, to, protect, his, base, or, to, go, in, search, of, the, saguenay, kingdom, cartier, left, for, france, in, early, june, 1542, encountering, roberval, and, his, ships, along, the, newfoundland, coast, at, about, the, time, roberval, marooned, marguerite, de, la, rocque, despite, roberval, s, insistence, that, he, accompany, him, back, to, saguenay, cartier, slipped, off, under, the, cover, of, darkness, and, continued, on, to, france, still, convinced, his, vessels, contained, a, wealth, of, gold, and, diamonds, he, arrived, there, in, october, in, what, proved, to, be, his, last, voyage, meanwhile, roberval, took, command, at, charlesbourg, royal, but, it, was, abandoned, in, 1543, after, disease, foul, weather, and, hostile, natives, drove, the, would, be, settlers, to, despair, cartier, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, in, saint, malo, and, his, nearby, estate, where, he, often, was, useful, as, an, interpreter, in, portuguese, he, died, at, age, 65, on, september, 1, 1557, during, an, epidemic, possibly, of, typhus, though, many, sources, list, his, cause, of, death, as, unknown, cartier, is, interred, in, saint, malo, cathedral, no, permanent, european, settlements, were, made, in, canada, before, 1605, when, pierre, dugua, with, samuel, champlain, founded, port, royal, in, acadia, having, already, located, the, entrance, to, the, st, lawrence, on, his, first, voyage, he, now, opened, up, the, greatest, waterway, for, the, european, penetration, of, north, america, he, produced, an, intelligent, estimate, of, the, resources, of, canada, both, natural, and, human, albeit, with, a, considerable, exaggeration, of, its, mineral, wealth, while, some, of, his, actions, toward, the, st, lawrence, iroquoians, were, dishonourable, he, did, try, at, times, to, establish, friendship, with, them, and, other, native, peoples, living, along, the, st, lawrence, river, an, indispensable, preliminary, to, french, settlement, in, their, lands, cartier, was, the, first, to, document, the, name, canada, to, designate, the, territory, on, the, shores, of, the, st, lawrence, river, the, name, is, derived, from, the, huron, iroquois, word, kanata, or, village, which, was, incorrectly, interpreted, as, the, native, term, for, the, newly, discovered, land, cartier, used, the, name, to, describe, stadacona, the, surrounding, land, and, the, river, itself, and, cartier, named, canadiens, the, inhabitants, iroquoians, he, had, seen, there, thereafter, the, name, canada, was, used, to, designate, the, small, french, colony, on, these, shores, and, the, french, colonists, were, called, canadiens, until, the, mid, nineteenth, century, when, the, name, started, to, be, applied, to, the, loyalist, colonies, on, the, great, lakes, and, later, to, all, of, british, north, america, in, this, way, cartier, is, not, strictly, the, european, discoverer, of, canada, as, this, country, is, understood, today, a, vast, federation, stretching, a, mari, usque, ad, mare, from, sea, to, sea, eastern, parts, had, previously, been, visited, by, the, norse, as, well, as, basque, galician, and, breton, fishermen, and, perhaps, the, corte, real, brothers, and, john, cabot, in, addition, of, course, to, the, natives, who, first, inhabited, the, territory, cartier, s, particular, contribution, to, the, discovery, of, canada, is, as, the, first, european, to, penetrate, the, continent, and, more, precisely, the, interior, eastern, region, along, the, st, lawrence, river, his, explorations, consolidated, france, s, claim, of, the, territory, that, would, later, be, colonized, as, new, france, and, his, third, voyage, produced, the, first, documented, european, attempt, at, settling, north, america, since, that, of, lucas, v, zquez, de, ayll, n, in, 1526, 27, cartier, s, professional, abilities, can, be, easily, ascertained, considering, that, cartier, made, three, voyages, of, exploration, in, dangerous, and, hitherto, unknown, waters, without, losing, a, ship, and, that, he, entered, and, departed, some, 50, undiscovered, harbours, without, serious, mishap, he, may, be, considered, one, of, the, most, conscientious, explorers, of, the, period, cartier, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, formally, acknowledge, that, the, new, world, was, a, land, mass, separate, from, europe, asia, on, august, 18, 2006, quebec, premier, jean, charest, announced, that, canadian, archaeologists, had, discovered, the, precise, location, of, cartier, s, lost, first, colony, of, charlesbourg, royal, the, colony, was, built, at, the, confluence, of, the, rivi, re, du, cap, rouge, with, the, st, lawrence, river, and, is, based, on, the, discovery, of, burnt, wooden, timber, remains, that, have, been, dated, to, the, mid, 16th, century, and, a, fragment, of, a, decorative, istoriato, plate, manufactured, in, faenza, italy, between, 1540, and, 1550, that, could, only, have, belonged, to, a, member, of, the, french, aristocracy, in, the, colony, most, probably, this, was, the, sieur, de, roberval, who, replaced, cartier, as, the, leader, of, the, settlement, this, colony, was, the, first, known, european, settlement, in, modern, day, canada, since, the, c, 1000, l, anse, aux, meadows, viking, village, in, northern, newfoundland, its, rediscovery, has, been, hailed, by, archaeologists, as, the, most, important, find, in, canada, since, the, l, anse, aux, meadows, rediscovery, jacques, cartier, island, located, on, the, tip, of, the, great, northern, peninsula, in, newfoundland, and, labrador, in, the, town, of, quirpon, is, said, to, have, been, named, by, jacques, cartier, himself, on, one, of, his, voyages, through, the, strait, of, belle, isle, during, the, 1530s, the, banque, jacques, cartier, existed, and, printed, banknotes, between, 1861, and, 1899, in, lower, canada, then, quebec, it, was, folded, into, the, banque, provinciale, du, canada, and, later, still, the, national, bank, of, canada, in, 2005, cartier, s, bref, r, cit, et, succincte, narration, de, la, navigation, faite, en, mdxxxv, et, mdxxxvi, was, named, one, of, the, 100, most, important, books, in, canadian, history, by, the, literary, review, of, canada, canadian, rock, band, the, tragically, hip, reference, jacques, cartier, in, their, 1992, song, looking, for, a, place, to, happen, the, song, deals, with, the, subject, of, european, encroachment, in, the, new, world, and, the, eventual, annexation, of, indigenous, lands, in, north, america
