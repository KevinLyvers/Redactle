their, commands, and, return, to, the, status, of, private, citizens, his, proposal, was, well, received, by, most, of, the, senators, but, the, consuls, and, cato, vehemently, opposed, it, antony, then, made, a, new, proposal, caesar, would, retain, only, two, of, his, eight, legions, and, the, governorship, of, illyrium, if, he, was, allowed, to, stand, for, the, consulship, in, absentia, though, pompey, found, the, concession, satisfactory, cato, and, lentulus, refused, to, back, down, antony, fled, rome, claiming, to, fear, for, his, life, and, returned, to, caesar, s, camp, in,

pompeian, loyalists, there, meanwhile, antony, with, the, rank, of, propraetor, was, installed, as, governor, of, italy, and, commander, of, the, army, stationed, there, while, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, one, of, caesar, s, staff, officers, ran, the, provisional, administration, of, rome, itself, though, antony, was, well, liked, by, his, soldiers, most, other, citizens, despised, him, for, his, lack, of, interest, in, the, hardships, they, faced, from, the, civil, war, by, the, end, of, the, year, 49, bc, caesar, already, the, ruler, of, gaul, had, captured, italy, spain, sicily, and,

legions, they, commanded, defected, to, pompey, without, their, fleet, caesar, lacked, the, necessary, transport, ships, to, cross, into, greece, with, his, seven, legions, instead, he, sailed, with, only, two, and, placed, antony, in, command, of, the, remaining, five, at, brundisium, with, instructions, to, join, him, as, soon, as, he, was, able, in, early, 48, bc, lucius, scribonius, libo, was,

s, camp, but, pompey, s, larger, forces, pushed, back, the, assault, though, an, indecisive, result, the, victory, was, a, tactical, win, for, pompey, pompey, however, did, not, order, a, counterassault, on, caesar, s, camp, allowing, caesar, to, retreat, unhindered, caesar, would, later, remark, the, civil, war, would, have, ended, that, day, if, only, pompey, had, attacked, him, caesar, managed, to, retreat, to, thessaly, with, pompey, in, pursuit, assuming, a, defensive, position, at, the, plain, of, pharsalus, caesar, s, army, prepared, for, pitched, battle, with, pompey, s, which, outnumbered, his, own, two, to, one, at, the, battle, of, pharsalus, on, 9, august, 48, bc, caesar, commanded, the, right, wing, opposite, pompey, while, antony, commanded, the, left, the, resulting, battle, was, a, decisive, victory, for, caesar, though, the, civil, war, did, not, end, at, pharsalus, the, battle, marked, the, pinnacle, of, caesar, s, power, and, effectively, ended, the, republic, the, battle, gave, caesar, a, much, needed, boost, in, legitimacy, as, prior, to, the, battle, much, of, the, roman, world, outside, italy, supported, pompey, and, the, senators, around, him, as, the, legitimate, roman, government, after, pompey, s, defeat, most, of, the, senate, defected, to, caesar, including, many, of, the, soldiers, who, had, fought, under, pompey, pompey, himself, fled, to, ptolemaic, egypt, but, pharaoh, ptolemy, xiii, theos, philopator, feared, retribution, from, caesar, and, had, pompey, assassinated, upon, his, arrival, after, the, battle, caesar,

alexandrian, war, deposing, ptolemy, xiii, in, favour, of, cleopatra, who, became, caesar, s, mistress, and, bore, him, a, son, caesarion, caesar, s, actions, further, strengthened, roman, control, over, the, already, roman, dominated, kingdom, while, caesar, was, away, in, egypt, antony, remained, in, rome, to, govern, italy, and, restore, order, without, caesar, to, guide, him, however, antony, quickly, faced, political, difficulties, and, proved, himself, unpopular, the, chief, cause, of, his, political, challenges, concerned, debt, forgiveness, one, of, the, tribunes, for, 47, bc, publius, cornelius, dolabella, proposed, a, law, which, would, have, canceled, all, outstanding, debts, antony, opposed, the, law, for, political, and, personal, reasons, he, believed, caesar, would, not, support, such, massive, relief, and, suspected, dolabella, had, seduced, his, wife, antonia, hybrida, when, dolabella, sought, to, enact, the, law, by, force, and, seized, the, forum, antony, responded, by, unleashing, his, soldiers, upon, the, assembled, masses, killing, hundreds, the, resulting, instability, especially, among, caesar, s, veterans, who, would, have, benefited, from, the, law, forced, caesar, to, return, to, italy, by, october, 47, bc, antony, s, handling, of, the, affair, with, dolabella, led, to, a, cooling, of, his, relationship, with, caesar, antony, s, violent, reaction, had, caused, rome, to, fall, into, a, state, of, anarchy, caesar, sought, to, mend, relations, with, dolabella, he, was, elected, to, a, third, term, as, consul, for, 46, bc, but, proposed, the, senate, should, transfer, the, consulship, to, dolabella, when, antony, protested, caesar, was, forced, to, withdraw, the, motion, later, caesar, sought, to, exercise, his, prerogatives, as, dictator, and, directly, proclaim, dolabella, as, consul, instead, antony, again, protested, and, in, his, capacity, as, an, augur, declared, the, omens, were, unfavorable, and, caesar, again, backed, down, seeing, the, expediency, of, removing, dolabella, from, rome, caesar, ultimately, pardoned, him, for, his, role, in, the, riots, and, took, him, as, one, of, his, generals, in, his, campaign, antony, however, was, stripped, of, all, official, positions, and, received, no, appointments, for, the, year, 46, bc, or, 45, bc, instead, of, antony, caesar, appointed, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, to, be, his, consular, colleague, for, 46, bc, lepidus, also, replaced, antony, as, master, of, horse, for, caesar, s, various, dictatorships, while, caesar, campaigned, in, north, africa, antony, remained, in, rome, as, a, mere, private, citizen, after, returning, victorious, from, north, africa, caesar, was, appointed, dictator, for, ten, years, and, brought, cleopatra, and, their, son, to, rome, antony, again, remained, in, rome, while, caesar, in, 45, bc, sailed, to, spain, to, defeat, the, final, opposition, to, his, rule, successful, the, civil, war, ended, following, the, scandal, with, dolabella, antony, had, divorced, his, second, wife, and, quickly, married, fulvia, fulvia, had, previously, been, married, to, both, publius, clodius, pulcher, and, gaius, scribonius, curio, having, been, a, widow, since, curio, s, death, in, the, battle, of, the, bagradas, in, 49, bc, though, antony, and, fulvia, were, formally, married, in, 47, bc, cicero, suggests, the, two, had, been, in, a, relationship, since, at, least, 58, bc, the, union, produced, two, children, marcus, antonius, antyllus, born, 47, and, iullus, antonius, born, 45, whatever, conflicts, existed, between, himself, and, caesar, antony, remained, faithful, to, caesar, ensuring, their, estrangement, did, not, last, long, antony, reunited, with, caesar, at, narbo, in, 45, bc, with, full, reconciliation, coming, in, 44, bc, when, antony, was, elected, consul, alongside, caesar, caesar, planned, a, new, invasion, of, parthia, and, desired, to, leave, antony, in, italy, to, govern, rome, in, his, name, the, reconciliation, came, soon, after, antony, is, said, to, have, rejected, an, offer, from, gaius, trebonius, one, of, caesar, s, generals, to, join, a, conspiracy, to, assassinate, caesar, if, such, an, offer, was, made, antony, made, no, mention, of, the, matter, to, caesar, soon, after, they, assumed, office, together, the, lupercalia, was, held, on, 15, february, 44, bc, the, festival, was, held, in, honor, of, lupa, the, she, wolf, who, suckled, the, infant, orphans, romulus, and, remus, the, founders, of, rome, the, political, atmosphere, of, rome, at, the, time, of, the, festival, was, deeply, divided, caesar, had, by, this, point, centralised, almost, all, political, powers, into, his, own, hands, he, was, granted, further, honors, including, a, form, of, semi, official, cult, with, antony, as, his, high, priest, additionally, on, 1, january, 44, bc, caesar, had, been, named, dictator, perpetuo, removing, any, formal, end, to, his, autocratic, powers, caesar, s, political, rivals, feared, this, dictatorship, with, no, end, date, would, transform, the, republic, into, a, monarchy, abolishing, the, centuries, of, rule, by, the, senate, and, people, during, the, festival, s, activities, antony, publicly, offered, caesar, a, diadem, which, caesar, threw, off, when, antony, placed, the, diadem, in, his, lap, caesar, ordered, the, diadem, to, be, placed, in, the, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, when, antony, offered, caesar, the, crown, there, had, been, minor, applause, but, mostly, silence, from, the, crowd, when, caesar, refused, it, however, the, crowd, was, enthusiastic, the, event, presented, a, powerful, message, a, diadem, was, a, symbol, of, a, king, by, refusing, it, caesar, demonstrated, he, had, no, intention, of, making, himself, king, antony, s, motive, for, such, actions, is, not, clear, and, it, is, unknown, if, he, acted, with, caesar, s, prior, approval, or, on, his, own, while, commonly, described, as, an, event, that, was, scripted, who, was, central, to, planning, it, is, unclear, one, argument, is, that, antony, moved, forward, with, the, gesture, on, his, own, accord, possibly, to, embarrass, or, flatter, caesar, a, later, claim, was, that, he, was, actually, trying, to, convince, caesar, not, to, go, through, with, a, kingship, by, other, accounts, it, was, caesar, s, enemies, who, planned, the, incident, as, a, way, to, frame, him, with, it, being, claimed, two, enemies, of, caesar, approached, him, to, argue, he, should, take, the, diadem, another, theory, one, especially, popular, at, the, time, was, that, caesar, himself, had, orchestrated, the, event, to, test, public, support, on, him, becoming, king, a, group, of, senators, resolved, to, kill, caesar, to, prevent, him, from, establishing, a, monarchy, chief, among, them, were, marcus, junius, brutus, and, gaius, cassius, longinus, although, cassius, was, the, moving, spirit, in, the, plot, winning, over, the, chief, assassins, to, the, cause, of, tyrannicide, brutus, with, his, family, s, history, of, deposing, rome, s, kings, became, their, leader, cicero, though, not, personally, involved, in, the, conspiracy, later, claimed, antony, s, actions, sealed, caesar, s, fate, as, such, an, obvious, display, of, caesar, s, preeminence, motivated, them, to, act, originally, the, conspirators, had, planned, to, eliminate, not, only, caesar, but, also, many, of, his, supporters, including, antony, but, brutus, rejected, the, proposal, limiting, the, conspiracy, to, caesar, alone, with, caesar, preparing, to, depart, for, parthia, in, late, march, the, conspirators, prepared, to, act, when, caesar, appeared, for, the, senate, meeting, on, the, ides, of, march, 15, march, antony, also, went, with, caesar, but, was, waylaid, at, the, door, of, the, theatre, of, pompey, by, trebonius, and, was, distracted, from, aiding, caesar, according, to, the, greek, historian, plutarch, as, caesar, arrived, at, the, senate, lucius, tillius, cimber, presented, him, with, a, petition, to, recall, his, exiled, brother, the, other, conspirators, crowded, round, to, offer, their, support, within, moments, the, group, of, five, conspirators, stabbed, caesar, one, by, one, caesar, attempted, to, get, away, but, being, drenched, by, blood, he, tripped, and, fell, according, to, roman, historian, eutropius, around, 60, or, more, men, participated, in, the, assassination, caesar, was, stabbed, 23, times, and, died, from, the, blood, loss, attributable, to, multiple, stab, wounds, in, the, turmoil, surrounding, the, assassination, antony, escaped, rome, dressed, as, a, slave, fearing, caesar, s, death, would, be, the, start, of, a, bloodbath, among, his, supporters, when, this, did, not, occur, he, soon, returned, to, rome, the, conspirators, who, styled, themselves, the, liberatores, liberators, had, barricaded, themselves, on, the, capitoline, hill, although, they, believed, caesar, s, death, would, restore, the, republic, caesar, had, been, immensely, popular, with, the, roman, middle, and, lower, classes, who, became, enraged, upon, learning, a, small, group, of, aristocrats, had, killed, their, champion, antony, as, the, sole, consul, soon, took, the, initiative, and, seized, the, state, treasury, calpurnia, caesar, s, widow, presented, him, with, caesar, s, personal, papers, and, custody, of, his, extensive, property, clearly, marking, him, as, caesar, s, heir, and, leader, of, the, caesarians, caesar, s, master, of, horse, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, marched, over, 6, 000, troops, into, rome, on, 16, march, to, restore, order, and, intimidate, the, liberatores, lepidus, wanted, to, storm, the, capitol, but, antony, preferred, a, peaceful, solution, as, a, majority, of, both, the, liberatores, and, caesar, s, own, supporters, preferred, a, settlement, over, renewed, civil, war, on, 17, march, at, antony, s, arrangement, the, senate, met, to, discuss, a, compromise, which, due, to, the, presence, of, caesar, s, veterans, in, the, city, was, quickly, reached, caesar, s, assassins, would, be, pardoned, of, their, crimes, and, in, return, all, of, caesar, s, actions, would, be, ratified, in, particular, the, offices, assigned, to, both, brutus, and, cassius, by, caesar, were, likewise, ratified, antony, also, agreed, to, accept, the, appointment, of, his, rival, dolabella, as, his, consular, colleague, to, replace, caesar, this, compromise, was, a, great, success, for, antony, who, managed, to, simultaneously, appease, caesar, s, veterans, reconcile, the, senate, majority, and, appear, to, the, liberatores, as, their, partner, on, 19, march, caesar, s, will, was, opened, and, read, in, it, caesar, posthumously, adopted, his, great, nephew, gaius, octavius, and, named, him, his, principal, heir, then, only, nineteen, years, old, and, stationed, with, caesar, s, army, in, macedonia, the, youth, became, a, member, of, caesar, s, gens, julia, with, the, name, gaius, julius, caesar, for, clarity, it, is, historical, convention, to, call, him, octavian, though, not, the, chief, beneficiary, antony, did, receive, some, bequests, shortly, after, the, compromise, was, reached, as, a, sign, of, good, faith, brutus, against, the, advice, of, cassius, and, cicero, agreed, caesar, would, be, given, a, public, funeral, and, his, will, would, be, validated, caesar, s, funeral, was, held, on, 20, march, antony, as, caesar, s, faithful, lieutenant, and, incumbent, consul, was, chosen, to, preside, over, the, ceremony, and, to, recite, a, eulogy, in, a, demagogic, speech, he, enumerated, the, deeds, of, caesar, and, publicly, reading, his, will, detailed, the, donations, caesar, had, left, to, the, roman, people, antony, then, seized, the, blood, stained, toga, from, caesar, s, body, and, presented, it, to, the, crowd, worked, into, a, fury, by, the, bloody, spectacle, the, assembly, turned, into, a, riot, several, buildings, in, the, forum, and, some, houses, of, the, conspirators, were, burned, to, the, ground, panicked, many, of, the, conspirators, fled, italy, under, the, pretext, of, not, being, able, to, guarantee, their, safety, antony, relieved, brutus, and, cassius, of, their, judicial, duties, in, rome, and, instead, assigned, them, responsibility, for, procuring, wheat, for, rome, from, sicily, and, asia, such, an, assignment, in, addition, to, being, unworthy, of, their, rank, would, have, kept, them, far, from, rome, and, shifted, the, balance, towards, antony, refusing, such, secondary, duties, the, two, traveled, to, greece, instead, additionally, cleopatra, left, rome, to, return, to, egypt, despite, the, provisions, of, caesar, s, will, antony, proceeded, to, act, as, leader, of, the, caesarians, including, appropriating, for, himself, a, portion, of, caesar, s, fortune, rightfully, belonging, to, octavian, antony, enacted, the, lex, antonia, which, formally, abolished, the, dictatorship, in, an, attempt, to, consolidate, his, support, among, those, who, opposed, caesar, s, dictatorial, rule, he, also, enacted, a, number, of, laws, he, purported, to, have, found, in, caesar, s, papers, to, ensure, his, popularity, with, caesar, s, veterans, particularly, by, providing, land, grants, to, them, lepidus, with, antony, s, support, was, elected, pontifex, maximus, succeeding, caesar, to, solidify, the, alliance, between, antony, and, lepidus, antony, s, daughter, antonia, prima, was, engaged, to, lepidus, homonymous, son, surrounding, himself, with, a, bodyguard, of, over, six, thousand, of, caesar, s, veterans, antony, presented, himself, as, caesar, s, true, successor, largely, ignoring, octavian, octavian, arrived, in, rome, in, may, to, claim, his, inheritance, although, antony, had, amassed, political, support, octavian, still, had, opportunity, to, rival, him, as, the, leading, member, of, the, caesarian, faction, the, senate, increasingly, viewed, antony, as, a, new, tyrant, antony, had, also, lost, the, support, of, many, supporters, of, caesar, when, he, opposed, the, motion, to, elevate, caesar, to, divine, status, when, antony, refused, to, relinquish, caesar, s, vast, fortune, to, him, octavian, borrowed, heavily, to, fulfill, the, bequests, in, caesar, s, will, to, the, roman, people, and, to, his, veterans, as, well, as, to, establish, his, own, bodyguard, of, veterans, this, earned, him, the, support, of, caesarian, sympathizers, who, hoped, to, use, him, as, a, means, of, eliminating, antony, the, senate, and, cicero, in, particular, viewed, antony, as, the, greater, danger, of, the, two, by, summer, 44, bc, antony, was, in, a, difficult, political, position, he, could, either, denounce, the, liberatores, as, murderers, and, alienate, the, senate, or, he, could, maintain, his, support, for, the, compromise, and, risk, betraying, caesar, s, legacy, strengthening, octavian, s, position, in, either, case, his, situation, as, ruler, of, rome, would, be, weakened, roman, historian, cassius, dio, later, recorded, that, while, antony, as, consul, maintained, the, advantage, in, the, relationship, the, general, affection, of, the, roman, people, was, shifting, to, octavian, due, to, his, status, as, caesar, s, son, supporting, the, senatorial, faction, against, antony, octavian, in, september, 44, bc, encouraged, the, eminent, senator, marcus, tullius, cicero, to, attack, antony, in, a, series, of, speeches, portraying, him, as, a, threat, to, the, republic, risk, of, civil, war, between, antony, and, octavian, grew, octavian, continued, to, recruit, caesar, s, veterans, to, his, side, away, from, antony, with, two, of, antony, s, legions, defecting, in, november, 44, bc, at, that, time, octavian, only, a, private, citizen, lacked, legal, authority, to, command, the, republic, s, armies, making, his, command, illegal, with, popular, opinion, in, rome, turning, against, him, and, his, consular, term, nearing, its, end, antony, attempted, to, secure, a, favorable, military, assignment, to, secure, an, army, to, protect, himself, the, senate, as, was, custom, assigned, antony, and, dolabella, the, provinces, of, macedonia, and, syria, respectively, to, govern, in, 43, bc, after, their, consular, terms, expired, antony, however, objected, to, the, assignment, preferring, to, govern, cisalpine, gaul, which, was, already, controlled, by, decimus, junius, brutus, albinus, one, of, caesar, s, assassins, when, decimus, refused, to, surrender, his, province, antony, marched, north, in, december, 44, bc, with, his, remaining, soldiers, to, take, the, province, by, force, besieging, decimus, at, mutina, the, senate, led, by, a, fiery, cicero, denounced, antony, s, actions, and, declared, him, an, enemy, of, the, state, ratifying, octavian, s, extraordinary, command, on, 1, january, 43, bc, the, senate, dispatched, him, along, with, consuls, hirtius, and, pansa, to, defeat, antony, and, his, exhausted, five, legions, antony, s, forces, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, mutina, in, april, 43, bc, forcing, antony, to, retreat, to, transalpine, gaul, both, consuls, were, killed, however, leaving, octavian, in, sole, command, of, their, armies, some, eight, legions, with, antony, defeated, the, senate, assigned, command, of, the, legions, in, northern, italy, to, decimus, sextus, pompey, son, of, caesar, s, old, rival, pompey, magnus, was, given, command, of, the, republic, s, fleet, from, his, base, in, sicily, while, brutus, and, cassius, were, granted, the, governorships, of, macedonia, and, syria, respectively, these, appointments, attempted, to, renew, the, republican, cause, however, the, eight, legions, serving, under, octavian, composed, largely, of, caesar, s, veterans, refused, to, follow, one, of, caesar, s, murderers, allowing, octavian, to, retain, his, command, meanwhile, antony, recovered, his, position, by, joining, forces, with, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, who, had, been, assigned, the, governorship, of, transalpine, gaul, and, nearer, spain, antony, sent, lepidus, to, rome, to, broker, a, conciliation, though, he, was, an, ardent, caesarian, lepidus, had, maintained, friendly, relations, with, the, senate, and, with, sextus, pompey, his, legions, however, quickly, joined, antony, giving, him, control, over, seventeen, legions, the, largest, army, in, the, west, by, mid, may, octavian, began, secret, negotiations, to, form, an, alliance, with, antony, to, unify, the, caesarians, against, the, liberatores, remaining, in, cisalpine, gaul, octavian, dispatched, emissaries, to, rome, in, july, 43, bc, demanding, he, be, appointed, consul, to, succeed, hirtius, and, pansa, and, that, the, senate, rescind, the, decree, declaring, antony, a, public, enemy, when, the, senate, refused, octavian, marched, on, rome, with, his, eight, legions, and, assumed, control, of, the, city, in, august, 43, bc, octavian, had, himself, irregularly, elected, consul, with, a, cousin, rewarded, his, soldiers, and, then, set, about, prosecuting, caesar, s, murderers, under, the, lex, pedia, all, of, the, conspirators, and, sextus, pompey, were, convicted, in, absentia, and, declared, public, enemies, then, at, the, instigation, of, lepidus, octavian, went, to, cisalpine, gaul, to, meet, antony, in, november, 43, bc, octavian, lepidus, and, antony, met, near, bononia, after, two, days, of, discussions, the, group, agreed, to, establish, a, three, man, dictatorship, to, govern, the, republic, for, five, years, known, to, modern, historians, as, the, second, triumvirate, they, shared, military, command, of, the, republic, s, armies, and, provinces, among, themselves, antony, received, gaul, lepidus, spain, and, octavian, as, the, junior, partner, africa, they, jointly, governed, italy, the, triumvirate, would, have, to, conquer, the, rest, of, rome, s, holdings, brutus, and, cassius, held, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, sextus, pompey, held, the, mediterranean, islands, on, 27, november, 43, bc, the, triumvirate, was, formally, established, by, a, new, law, the, lex, titia, octavian, and, antony, reinforced, their, alliance, through, octavian, s, marriage, to, antony, s, stepdaughter, claudia, the, primary, objective, of, the, triumvirate, was, to, avenge, caesar, s, death, and, to, make, war, upon, his, murderers, before, marching, against, brutus, and, cassius, in, the, east, the, triumvirs, issued, proscriptions, against, their, enemies, in, rome, the, dictator, lucius, cornelius, sulla, had, taken, similar, action, to, purge, rome, of, his, opponents, in, 82, bc, the, proscribed, were, named, on, public, lists, stripped, of, citizenship, and, outlawed, their, wealth, and, property, were, confiscated, by, the, state, and, rewards, were, offered, to, anyone, who, secured, their, arrest, or, death, with, such, encouragements, the, proscription, produced, deadly, results, two, thousand, equites, were, executed, and, one, third, of, the, senate, antony, forced, octavian, to, give, up, cicero, a, personal, enemy, of, antony, and, friend, of, octavian, who, was, then, killed, on, 7, december, the, confiscations, helped, replenish, the, state, treasury, which, had, been, depleted, by, caesar, s, civil, war, the, decade, before, when, this, seemed, insufficient, to, fund, the, imminent, war, against, brutus, and, cassius, the, triumvirs, imposed, new, taxes, especially, on, the, wealthy, by, january, 42, bc, the, proscription, had, ended, it, had, lasted, two, months, and, though, less, bloody, than, sulla, s, it, traumatized, roman, society, a, number, of, those, named, and, outlawed, had, fled, to, either, sextus, pompey, in, sicily, or, to, the, liberatores, in, the, east, senators, who, swore, loyalty, to, the, triumvirate, were, allowed, to, keep, their, positions, on, 1, january, 42, bc, the, senate, officially, deified, caesar, as, the, divine, julius, and, confirmed, antony, s, position, as, his, high, priest, due, to, the, infighting, within, the, triumvirate, during, 43, bc, brutus, and, cassius, had, assumed, control, of, much, of, rome, s, eastern, territories, and, amassed, a, large, army, before, the, triumvirate, could, cross, the, adriatic, into, greece, the, triumvirate, had, to, address, the, threat, posed, by, sextus, pompey, and, his, fleet, from, his, base, in, sicily, sextus, raided, the, italian, coast, and, blockaded, the, triumvirs, octavian, s, friend, and, admiral, quintus, salvidienus, rufus, thwarted, an, attack, by, sextus, against, the, southern, italian, mainland, at, rhegium, but, salvidienus, was, then, defeated, in, the, resulting, naval, battle, because, of, the, inexperience, of, his, crews, only, when, antony, arrived, with, his, fleet, was, the, blockade, broken, though, the, blockade, was, defeated, control, of, sicily, remained, in, sextus, hand, but, the, defeat, of, the, liberatores, was, the, triumvirate, s, first, priority, in, the, summer, of, 42, bc, octavian, and, antony, sailed, for, macedonia, to, face, the, liberatores, with, nineteen, legions, the, vast, majority, of, their, army, approximately, 100, 000, regular, infantry, plus, supporting, cavalry, and, irregular, auxiliary, units, leaving, rome, under, the, administration, of, lepidus, likewise, the, army, of, the, liberatores, also, commanded, an, army, of, nineteen, legions, their, legions, however, were, not, at, full, strength, while, the, legions, of, antony, and, octavian, were, while, the, triumvirs, commanded, a, larger, number, of, infantry, the, liberators, commanded, a, larger, cavalry, contingent, the, liberatores, who, controlled, macedonia, did, not, wish, to, engage, in, a, decisive, battle, but, rather, to, attain, a, good, defensive, position, and, then, use, their, naval, superiority, to, block, the, triumvirs, communications, with, their, supply, base, in, italy, they, had, spent, the, previous, months, plundering, greek, cities, to, swell, their, war, chest, and, had, gathered, in, thrace, with, the, roman, legions, from, the, eastern, provinces, and, levies, from, rome, s, client, kingdoms, brutus, and, cassius, held, a, position, on, the, high, ground, along, both, sides, of, the, via, egnatia, west, of, the, city, of, philippi, the, south, position, was, anchored, to, a, supposedly, impassable, marsh, while, the, north, was, bordered, by, impervious, hills, they, had, plenty, of, time, to, fortify, their, position, with, a, rampart, and, a, ditch, brutus, put, his, camp, on, the, north, while, cassius, occupied, the, south, of, the, via, egnatia, antony, arrived, shortly, and, positioned, his, army, on, the, south, of, the, via, egnatia, while, octavian, put, his, legions, north, of, the, road, antony, offered, battle, several, times, but, the, liberatores, were, not, lured, to, leave, their, defensive, stand, thus, antony, tried, to, secretly, outflank, the, brutus, and, cassius, position, through, the, marshes, in, the, south, this, provoked, a, pitched, battle, on, 3, october, 42, bc, antony, commanded, the, triumvirate, s, army, due, to, octavian, s, sickness, on, the, day, with, antony, directly, controlling, the, right, flank, opposite, cassius, because, of, his, health, octavian, remained, in, camp, while, his, lieutenants, assumed, a, position, on, the, left, flank, opposite, brutus, in, the, resulting, first, battle, of, philippi, antony, defeated, cassius, and, captured, his, camp, while, brutus, overran, octavian, s, troops, and, penetrated, into, the, triumvirs, camp, but, was, unable, to, capture, the, sick, octavian, the, battle, was, a, tactical, draw, but, due, to, poor, communications, cassius, believed, the, battle, was, a, complete, defeat, and, committed, suicide, to, prevent, being, captured, brutus, assumed, sole, command, of, the, army, and, preferred, a, war, of, attrition, over, open, conflict, his, officers, however, were, dissatisfied, with, these, defensive, tactics, and, his, caesarian, veterans, threatened, to, defect, forcing, brutus, to, give, battle, at, the, second, battle, of, philippi, on, 23, october, while, the, battle, was, initially, evenly, matched, antony, s, leadership, routed, brutus, forces, brutus, committed, suicide, the, day, after, the, defeat, and, the, remainder, of, his, army, swore, allegiance, to, the, triumvirate, over, fifty, thousand, romans, died, in, the, two, battles, while, antony, treated, the, losers, mildly, octavian, dealt, cruelly, with, his, prisoners, and, even, beheaded, brutus, corpse, the, battles, of, philippi, ended, the, civil, war, in, favor, of, the, triumvirs, with, the, defeat, of, brutus, and, cassius, only, sextus, pompey, and, his, fleet, remained, to, challenge, the, triumvirate, s, control, of, the, roman, world, the, victory, at, philippi, left, the, members, of, the, triumvirate, as, masters, of, the, republic, save, sextus, pompey, in, sicily, upon, returning, to, rome, the, triumvirate, repartitioned, rule, of, rome, s, provinces, among, themselves, with, antony, as, the, clear, senior, partner, he, received, the, largest, distribution, governing, all, of, the, eastern, provinces, while, retaining, gaul, in, the, west, octavian, s, position, improved, as, he, received, spain, which, was, taken, from, lepidus, lepidus, was, then, reduced, to, holding, only, africa, and, he, assumed, a, clearly, tertiary, role, in, the, triumvirate, rule, over, italy, remained, undivided, but, octavian, was, assigned, the, difficult, and, unpopular, task, of, demobilizing, their, veterans, and, providing, them, with, land, distributions, in, italy, antony, assumed, direct, control, of, the, east, while, he, installed, one, of, his, lieutenants, as, the, ruler, of, gaul, during, his, absence, several, of, his, supporters, held, key, positions, in, rome, to, protect, his, interests, there, the, east, was, in, need, of, reorganization, in, addition, rome, contended, with, the, parthian, empire, for, dominance, of, the, near, east, the, parthian, threat, to, the, triumvirate, s, rule, was, urgent, due, to, the, fact, that, the, parthians, supported, the, liberatores, in, the, recent, civil, war, aid, which, included, the, supply, of, troops, at, philippi, as, ruler, of, the, east, antony, also, assumed, responsibility, for, overseeing, caesar, s, planned, invasion, of, parthia, to, avenge, the, defeat, of, marcus, licinius, crassus, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, in, 53, bc, in, 42, bc, the, roman, east, was, composed, of, several, directly, controlled, provinces, and, client, kingdoms,

nominally, independent, kingdoms, subject, to, roman, direction, these, kingdoms, included, antony, spent, the, winter, of, 42, bc, in, athens, where, he, ruled, generously, towards, the, greek, cities, a, proclaimed, philhellene, friend, of, all, things, greek, antony, supported, greek, culture, to, win, the, loyalty, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, greek, east, he, attended, religious, festivals, and, ceremonies, including, initiation, into, the, eleusinian, mysteries, a, secret, cult, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, the, goddesses, demeter, and, persephone, beginning, in, 41, bc, he, traveled, across, the, aegean, sea, to, anatolia, leaving, his, friend, lucius, marcius, censorius, as, governor, of, macedonia, and, achaea, upon, his, arrival, in, ephesus, in, asia, antony, was, worshiped, as, the, god, dionysus, born, anew, he, demanded, heavy, taxes, from, the, hellenic, cities, in, return, for, his, pro, greek, culture, policies, but, exempted, those, cities, which, had, remained, loyal, to, caesar, during, the, civil, war, and, compensated, those, cities, which, had, suffered, under, caesar, s, assassins, including, rhodes, lycia, and, tarsus, he, granted, pardons, to, all, roman, nobles, living, in, the, east, who, had, supported, pompey, except, for, caesar, s, assassins, ruling, from, ephesus, antony, consolidated, rome, s, hegemony, in, the, east, receiving, envoys, from, rome, s, client, kingdoms, and, intervening, in, their, dynastic, affairs, extracting, enormous, financial, gifts, from, them, in, the, process, though, king, deiotarus, of, galatia, supported, brutus, and, cassius, following, caesar, s, assassination, antony, allowed, him, to, retain, his, position, he, also, confirmed, ariarathes, x, as, king, of, cappadocia, after, the, execution, of, his, brother, ariobarzanes, iii, of, cappadocia, by, cassius, before, the, battle, of, philippi, in, hasmonean, judea, several, israelite, delegations, complained, to, antony, of,

her, loyalty, to, rome, antony, in, his, first, months, in, the, east, raised, money, reorganized, his, troops, and, secured, the, alliance, of, rome, s, client, kingdoms, he, also, promoted, himself, as, hellenistic, ruler, which, won, him, the, affection, of, the, greek, peoples, of, the, east, but, also, made, him, the, target, of, octavian, s, propaganda, in, rome, according, to, some, ancient, authors, antony, led, a, carefree, life, of, luxury, in, alexandria, upon, learning, the, parthian, empire, had, invaded, rome, s, territory, in, early, 40, bc, antony, left, egypt, for, syria, to, confront, the, invasion, however, after, a, short, stay, in, tyre, he, was, forced, to, sail, with, his, army, to, italy, to, confront, octavian, due, to, octavian, s, war, against, antony, s, wife, and, brother, following, the, defeat, of, brutus, and, cassius, while, antony, was, stationed, in, the, east, octavian, had, authority, over, the, west, octavian, s, chief, responsibility, was, distributing, land, to, tens, of, thousands, of, caesar, s, veterans, who, had, fought, for, the, triumvirate, additionally, tens, of, thousands, of, veterans, who, had, fought, for, the, republican, cause, in, the, war, also, required, land, grants, this, was, necessary, to, ensure, they, would, not, support, a, political, opponent, of, the, triumvirate, however, the, triumvirs, did, not, possess, sufficient, state, controlled, land, to, allot, to, the, veterans, this, left, octavian, with, two, options, alienating, many, roman, citizens, by, confiscating, their, land, or, alienating, many, roman, soldiers, who, might, back, a, military, rebellion, against, the, triumvirate, s, rule, octavian, chose, the, former, as, many, as, eighteen, roman, towns, through, italy, were, affected, by, the, confiscations, of, 41, bc, with, entire, populations, driven, out, led, by, fulvia, the, wife, of, antony, the, senators, grew, hostile, towards, octavian, over, the, issue, of, the, land, confiscations, according, to, the, ancient, historian, cassius, dio, fulvia, was, the, most, powerful, woman, in, rome, at, the, time, according, to, dio, while, publius, servilius, vatia, and, lucius, antonius, were, the, consuls, for, the, year, 41, bc, real, power, was, vested, in, fulvia, as, the, mother, in, law, of, octavian, and, the, wife, of, antony, no, action, was, taken, by, the, senate, without, her, support, fearing, octavian, s, land, grants, would, cause, the, loyalty, of, the, caesarian, veterans, to, shift, away, from, antony, fulvia, traveled, constantly, with, her, children, to, the, new, veteran, settlements, in, order, to, remind, the, veterans, of, their, debt, to, antony, fulvia, also, attempted, to, delay, the, land, settlements, until, antony, returned, to, rome, so, that, he, could, share, credit, for, the, settlements, with, the, help, of, antony, s, brother, the, consul, of, 41, bc, lucius, antonius, fulvia, encouraged, the, senate, to, oppose, octavian, s, land, policies, the, conflict, between, octavian, and, fulvia, caused, great, political, and, social, unrest, throughout, italy, tensions, escalated, into, open, war, however, when, octavian, divorced, claudia, fulvia, s, daughter, from, her, first, husband, publius, clodius, pulcher, outraged, fulvia, supported, by, lucius, raised, an, army, to, fight, for, antony, s, rights, against, octavian, according, to, the, ancient, historian, appian, fulvia, s, chief, reason, for, the, war, was, her, jealousy, of, antony, s, affairs, with, cleopatra, in, egypt, and, desire, to, draw, antony, back, to, rome, lucius, and, fulvia, took, a, political, and, martial, gamble, in, opposing, octavian, and, lepidus, however, as, the, roman, army, still, depended, on, the, triumvirs, for, their, salaries, lucius, and, fulvia, supported, by, their, army, marched, on, rome, and, promised, the, people, an, end, to, the, triumvirate, in, favor, of, antony, s, sole, rule, however, when, octavian, returned, to, the, city, with, his, army, the, pair, were, forced, to, retreat, to, perusia, in, etruria, octavian, placed, the, city, under, siege, while, lucius, waited, for, antony, s, legions, in, gaul, to, come, to, his, aid, away, in, the, east, and, embarrassed, by, fulvia, s, actions, antony, gave, no, instructions, to, his, legions, without, reinforcements, lucius, and, fulvia, were, forced, to, surrender, in, february, 40, bc, while, octavian, pardoned, lucius, for, his, role, in, the, war, and, even, granted, him, command, in, spain, as, his, chief, lieutenant, there, fulvia, was, forced, to, flee, to, greece, with, her, children, with, the, war, over, octavian, was, left, in, sole, control, over, italy, when, antony, s, governor, of, gaul, died, octavian, took, over, his, legions, there, further, strengthening, his, control, over, the, west, despite, the, parthian, empire, s, invasion, of, rome, s, eastern, territories, fulvia, s, civil, war, forced, antony, to, leave, the, east, and, return, to, rome, in, order, to, secure, his, position, meeting, her, in, athens, antony, rebuked, fulvia, for, her, actions, before, sailing, on, to, italy, with, his, army, to, face, octavian, laying, siege, to, brundisium, this, new, conflict, proved, untenable, for, both, octavian, and, antony, however, their, centurions, who, had, become, important, figures, politically, refused, to, fight, due, to, their, shared, service, under, caesar, the, legions, under, their, command, followed, suit, meanwhile, in, sicyon, fulvia, died, of, a, sudden, and, unknown, illness, fulvia, s, death, and, the, mutiny, of, their, soldiers, allowed, the, triumvirs, to, effect, a, reconciliation, through, a, new, power, sharing, agreement, in, september, 40, bc, the, roman, world, was, redivided, with, antony, receiving, the, eastern, provinces, octavian, the, western, provinces, and, lepidus, retained, his, junior, position, as, governor, of, africa, this, agreement, known, as, the, treaty, of, brundisium, reinforced, the, triumvirate, and, allowed, antony, to, begin, preparing, for, caesar, s, long, awaited, campaign, against, the, parthian, empire, as, a, symbol, of, their, renewed, alliance, antony, married, octavia, octavian, s, sister, in, october, 40, bc, the, rise, of, the, parthian, empire, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, rome, s, expansion, into, the, eastern, mediterranean, during, the, 2nd, century, bc, brought, the, two, powers, into, direct, contact, causing, centuries, of, tumultuous, and, strained, relations, though, periods, of, peace, developed, cultural, and, commercial, exchanges, war, was, a, constant, threat, influence, over, the, buffer, state, of, the, kingdom, of, armenia, located, to, the, north, east,

pontus, against, rome, before, being, decisively, defeated, by, pompey, in, 66, bc, thereafter, with, his, son, artavasdes, in, rome, as, a, hostage, tigranes, would, rule, armenia, as, an, ally, of, rome, until, his, death, in, 55, bc, rome, then, released, artavasdes, who, succeeded, his, father, as, king, in, 53, bc, rome, s, governor, of, syria, marcus, licinius, crassus, led, an, expedition,

his, parthian, expedition, on, the, condition, that, crassus, invade, through, armenia, as, the, safer, route, crassus, refused, choosing, instead, the, more, direct, route, by, crossing, the, euphrates, directly, into, desert, parthian, territory, crassus, actions, proved, disastrous, as, his, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, by, a, numerically, inferior, parthian, force,

intentions, to, invade, parthia, and, restore, roman, power, in, the, east, his, reasons, were, to, punish, the, parthians, for, assisting, pompey, in, the, recent, civil, war, to, avenge, crassus, defeat, at, carrhae, and, especially, to, match, the, glory, of, alexander, the, great, for, himself, before, caesar, could, launch, his, campaign, however, he, was, assassinated, as, part, of, the, compromise, between, antony, and, the, republicans, to, restore, order, following, caesar, s, murder, publius, cornelius, dolabella, was, assigned, the, governorship, of, syria, and, command, over, caesar, s, planned, parthian, campaign, the, compromise, did, not, hold, however, and, the, republicans, were, forced, to, flee, to, the, east, the, republicans, directed, quintus, labienus, to, attract, the, parthians, to, their, side, in, the, resulting, war, against, antony, and, octavian, after, the, liberatores, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, philippi, labienus, joined, the, parthians, despite, rome, s, internal, turmoil, during, the, time, the, parthians, did, not, immediately, benefit, from, the, power, vacuum, in, the, east, due, to, orodes, ii, s, reluctance, despite, labienus, urgings, to, the, contrary, in, the, summer, of, 41, bc, antony, to, reassert, roman, power, in, the, east, conquered, palmyra, on, the, roman, parthian, border, antony, then, spent, the, winter, of, 41, bc, in, alexandria, with, cleopatra, leaving, only, two, legions, to, defend, the, syrian, border, against, parthian, incursions, the, legions, however, were, composed, of, former, republican, troops, and, labienus, convinced, orodes, ii, to, invade, a, parthian, army, led, by, orodes, ii, s, eldest, son, pacorus, invaded, syria, in, early, 40, bc, labienus, the, republican, ally, of, brutus, and, cassius, accompanied, him, to, advise, him, and, to, rally, the, former, republican, soldiers, stationed, in, syria, to, the, parthian, cause, labienus, recruited, many, of, the, former, republican, soldiers, to, the, parthian, campaign, in, opposition, to, antony, the, joint, parthian, roman, force, after, initial, success, in, syria, separated, to, lead, their, offensive, in, two, directions, pacorus, marched, south, toward, hasmonean, judea, while, labienus, crossed, the, taurus, mountains, to, the, north, into, cilicia, labienus, conquered, southern, anatolia, with, little, resistance, the, roman, governor, of, asia, lucius, munatius, plancus, a, partisan, of, antony, was, forced, to, flee, his, province, allowing, labienus, to, recruit, the, roman, soldiers, stationed, there, for, his, part, pacorus, advanced, south, to, phoenicia, and, palestine, in, hasmonean, judea, the, exiled, prince, antigonus, allied, himself, with, the, parthians, when, his, brother, rome, s, client, king, hyrcanus, ii, refused, to, accept, parthian, domination, he, was, deposed, in, favor, of, antigonus, as, parthia, s, client, king, in, judea, pacorus,

in, the, region, antony, then, in, egypt, with, cleopatra, did, not, respond, immediately, to, the, parthian, invasion, though, he, left, alexandria, for, tyre, in, early, 40, bc, when, he, learned, of, the, civil, war, between, his, wife, and, octavian, he, was, forced, to, return, to, italy, with, his, army, to, secure, his, position, in, rome, rather, than, defeat, the, parthians, instead, antony, dispatched, publius, ventidius, bassus, to, check, the, parthian, advance, arriving, in, the, east, in, spring, 39, bc, ventidius, surprised, labienus, near, the, taurus, mountains, claiming, victory, at, the, cilician, gates, ventidius, ordered, labienus, executed, as, a, traitor, and, the, formerly, rebellious, roman, soldiers, under, his, command, were, reincorporated, under, antony, s, control, he, then, met, a, parthian, army, at, the, border, between, cilicia, and, syria, defeating, it, and, killing, a, large, portion, of, the, parthian, soldiers, at, the, amanus, pass, ventidius, actions, temporarily, halted, the, parthian, advance, and, restored, roman, authority, in, the, east, forcing, pacorus, to, abandon, his, conquests, and, return, to, parthia, in, the, spring, of, 38, bc, the, parthians, resumed, their, offensive, with, pacorus, leading, an, army, across, the, euphrates, ventidius, in, order, to, gain, time, leaked, disinformation, to, pacorus, implying, that, he, should, cross, the, euphrates, river, at, their, usual, ford, pacorus, did, not, trust, this, information, and, decided, to, cross, the, river, much, farther, downstream, this, was, what, ventidius, hoped, would, occur, and, gave, him, time, to, get, his, forces, ready, the, parthians, faced, no, opposition, and, proceeded, to, the, town, of, gindarus, in, cyrrhestica, where, ventidius, army, was, waiting, at, the, battle, of, cyrrhestica, ventidius, inflicted, an, overwhelming, defeat, against, the, parthians, which, resulted, in, the, death, of, pacorus, overall, the, roman, army, had, achieved, a, complete, victory, with, ventidius, three, successive, victories, forcing, the, parthians, back, across, the, euphrates, pacorus, death, threw, the, parthian, empire, into, chaos, shah, orodes, ii, overwhelmed, by, the, grief, of, his, son, s, death, appointed, his, younger, son, phraates, iv, as, his, successor, however, phraates, iv, assassinated, orodes, ii, in, late, 38, bc, succeeding, him, on, the, throne, ventidius, feared, antony, s, wrath, if, he, invaded, parthian, territory, thereby, stealing, his, glory, so, instead, he, attacked, and, subdued, the, eastern, kingdoms, which, had, revolted, against, roman, control, following, the, disastrous, defeat, of, crassus, at, carrhae, one, such, rebel, was, king, antiochus, of, commagene, whom, he, besieged, in, samosata, antiochus, tried, to, make, peace, with, ventidius, but, ventidius, told, him, to, approach, antony, directly, after, peace, was, concluded, antony, sent, ventidius, back, to, rome, where, he, celebrated, a, triumph, the, first, roman, to, triumph, over, the, parthians, while, antony, and, the, other, triumvirs, ratified, the, treaty, of, brundisium, to, redivide, the, roman, world, among, themselves, the, rebel, sextus, pompey, the, son, of, caesar, s, rival, pompey, the, great, was, largely, ignored, from, his, stronghold, on, sicily, he, continued, his, piratical, activities, across, italy, and, blocked, the, shipment, of, grain, to, rome, the, lack, of, food, in, rome, undermined, the, triumvirate, s, political, support, this, pressure, forced, the, triumvirs, to, meet, with, sextus, in, early, 39, bc, while, octavian, wanted, an, end, to, the, ongoing, blockade, of, italy, antony, sought, peace, in, the, west, in, order, to, make, the, triumvirate, s, legions, available, for, his, service, in, his, planned, campaign, against, the, parthians, though, the, triumvirs, rejected, sextus, initial, request, to, replace, lepidus, as, the, third, man, in, the, triumvirate, they, did, grant, other, concessions, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, misenum, sextus, was, allowed, to, retain, control, over, sicily, and, sardinia, with, the, provinces, of, corsica, and, greece, being, added, to, his, territory, he, was, also, promised, a, future, position, with, the, priestly, college, of, augurs, and, the, consulship, for, 35, bc, in, exchange, sextus, agreed, to, end, his, naval, blockade, of, italy, supply, rome, with, grain, and, halt, his, piracy, of, roman, merchant, ships, however, the, most, important, provision, of, the, treaty, was, the, end, of, the, proscription, the, trimumvirate, had, begun, in, late, 43, bc, many, of, the, proscribed, senators, rather, than, face, death, fled, to, sicily, seeking, sextus, protection, with, the, exception, of, those, responsible, for, caesar, s, assassination, all, those, proscribed, were, allowed, to, return, to, rome, and, promised, compensation, this, caused, sextus, to, lose, many, valuable, allies, as, the, formerly, exiled, senators, gradually, aligned, themselves, with, either, octavian, or, antony, to, secure, the, peace, octavian, betrothed, marcus, claudius, marcellus, octavian, s, three, year, old, nephew, and, antony, s, stepson, to, sextus, daughter, pompeia, with, peace, in, the, west, secured, antony, planned, to, retaliate, against, parthia, under, an, agreement, with, octavian, antony, would, be, supplied, with, extra, troops, for, his, campaign, with, this, military, purpose, on, his, mind, antony, sailed, to, greece, with, octavia, where, he, behaved, in, a, most, extravagant, manner, assuming, the, attributes, of, the, greek, god, dionysus, in, 39, bc, the, peace, with, sextus, was, short, lived, however, when, sextus, demanded, control, over, greece, as, the, agreement, provided, antony, demanded, the, province, s, tax, revenues, be, to, fund, the, parthian, campaign, sextus, refused, meanwhile, sextus, admiral, menas, betrayed, him, shifting, his, loyalty, to, octavian, and, thereby, granting, him, control, of, corsica, sardinia, three, of, sextus, legions, and, a, larger, naval, force, these, actions, worked, to, renew, sextus, blockade, of, italy, preventing, octavian, from, sending, the, promised, troops, to, antony, for, the, parthian, campaign, this, new, delay, caused, antony, to, quarrel, with, octavian, forcing, octavia, to, mediate, a, truce, between, them, under, the, treaty, of, tarentum, antony, provided, a, large, naval, force, for, octavian, s, use, against, sextus, while, octavian, promised, to, raise, new, legions, for, antony, to, support, his, invasion, of, parthia, as, the, term, of, the, triumvirate, was, set, to, expire, at, the, end, of, 38, bc, the, two, unilaterally, extended, their, term, of, office, another, five, years, until, 33, bc, without, seeking, approval, of, the, senate, or, the, assemblies, to, seal, the, treaty, antony, s, elder, son, marcus, antonius, antyllus, then, only, six, years, old, was, betrothed, to, octavian, s, only, daughter, julia, then, only, an, infant, with, the, treaty, signed, antony, returned, to, the, east, leaving, octavia, in, italy, with, publius,

early, 38, bc, antony, still, in, the, west, negotiating, with, octavian, ordered, sosius, to, depose, antigonus, who, had, been, installed, in, the, recent, parthian, invasion, as, the, ruler, of, hasmonean, judea, and, to, make, herod, the, new, roman, client, king, in, the, region, years, before, in, 40, bc, the, roman, senate, had, proclaimed, herod, king, of, the, jews, because, herod, had, been, a, loyal, supporter, of, hyrcanus, ii, rome, s, previous, client, king, before, the, parthian, invasion, and, was, from, a, family, with, long, standing, connections, to, rome, the, romans, hoped, to, use, herod, as, a, bulwark, against, the, parthians, in, the, coming, campaign, advancing, south, sosius, captured, the, island, city, of, aradus, on, the, coast, of, phoenicia, by, the, end, of, 38, bc, the, following, year, the, romans, besieged, jerusalem, after, a, forty, day, siege, the, roman, soldiers, stormed, the, city, and, despite, herod, s, pleas, for, restraint, acted, without, mercy, pillaging, and, killing, all, in, their, path, prompting, herod, to, complain, to, antony, herod, finally, resorted, to, bribing, sosius, and, his, troops, in, order, that, they, would, not, leave, him, king, of, a, desert, antigonus, was, forced, to, surrender, to, sosius, and, was, sent, to, antony, for, the, triumphal, procession, in, rome, herod, however, fearing, that, antigonus, would, win, backing, in, rome, bribed, antony, to, execute, antigonus, antony, who, recognized, that, antigonus, would, remain, a, permanent, threat, to, herod, ordered, him, beheaded, in, antioch, now, secure, on, his, throne, herod, would, rule, the, herodian, kingdom, until, his, death, in, 4, bc, and, would, be, an, ever, faithful, client, king, of, rome, with, the, triumvirate, renewed, in, 38, bc, antony, returned, to, athens, in, the, winter, with, his, new, wife, octavia, the, sister, of, octavian, with, the, assassination, of, the, parthian, king, orodes, ii, by, his, son, phraates, iv, who, then, seized, the, parthian, throne, in, late, 38, bc, antony, prepared, to, invade, parthia, himself, antony, however, realized, octavian, had, no, intention, of, sending, him, the, additional, legions, he, had, promised, under, the, treaty, of, tarentum, to, supplement, his, own, armies, antony, instead, looked, to, rome, s, principal, vassal, in, the, east, his, lover, cleopatra, in, addition, to, significant, financial, resources, cleopatra, s, backing, of, his, parthian, campaign, allowed, antony, to, amass, the, largest, army, rome, had, ever, assembled, in, the, east, wintering, in, antioch, during, 37, antony, s, combined, roman, egyptian, army, numbered, some, 100, 000, including, 60, 000, soldiers, from, sixteen, legions, 10, 000, cavalry, from, spain, and, gaul, plus, an, additional, 30, 000, auxiliaries, the, size, of, his, army, indicated, antony, s, intention, to, conquer, parthia, or, at, least, receive, its, submission, by, capturing, the, parthian, capital, of, ecbatana, antony, s, rear, was, protected, by, rome, s, client, kingdoms, in, anatolia, syria, and, judea, while, the, client, kingdoms, of, cappadocia, pontus, and,

an, ally, of, rome, since, the, defeat, of, tigranes, the, great, by, pompey, the, great, in, 66, bc, during, the, third, mithridatic, war, however, following, marcus, licinius, crassus, s, defeat,

to, armenia, receiving, artavasdes, ii, s, surrender, without, opposition, canidius, then, led, an, invasion, into, the, south, caucasus, subduing, iberia, there, canidius, forced, the, iberian, king, pharnavaz, ii, into, an, alliance, against, zober, king, of, neighboring, albania, subduing, the, kingdom, and, reducing, it, to, a, roman, protectorate, with, armenia, and, the, caucasus, secured, antony, marched, south, crossing, into, the, parthian, province, of, media, atropatene, though, antony, desired, a, pitched, battle, the, parthians, would, not, engage, allowing, antony, to, march, deep, into, parthian, territory, by, mid, august, of, 36, bc, this, forced, antony, to, leave, his, logistics, train, in, the, care, of, two, legions, approximately, 10, 000, soldiers, which, was, then, attacked, and, completely, destroyed, by, the, parthian, army, before, antony, could, rescue, them, though, the, armenian, king, artavasdes, ii, and, his, cavalry, were, present, during, the, massacre, they, did, not, intervene, despite, the, ambush, antony, continued, the, campaign, however, antony, was, soon, forced, to, retreat, in, mid, october, after, a, failed, two, month, siege, of, the, provincial, capital, the, retreat, soon, proved, a, disaster, as, antony, s, demoralized, army, faced, increasing, supply, difficulties, in, the, mountainous, terrain, during, winter, while, constantly, being, harassed, by, the, parthian, army, according, to, plutarch, eighteen, battles, were, fought, between, the, retreating, romans, and, the, parthians, during, the, month, long, march, back, to, armenia, with, approximately, 20, 000, infantry, and, 4, 000, cavalry, dying, during, the, retreat, alone, once, in, armenia, antony, quickly, marched, back, to, syria, to, protect, his, interests, there, by, late, 36, bc, losing, an, additional, 8, 000, soldiers, along, the, way, in, all, two, fifths, of, his, original, army, some, 80, 000, men, had, died, during, his, failed, campaign, the, narration, of, strabo, and, plutarch, blames, the, armenian, king, for, the, defeat, but, modern, sources, note, antony, s, poor, management, meanwhile, in, rome, the, triumvirate, was, no, more, octavian, forced, lepidus, to, resign, after, the, older, triumvir, attempted, to, take, control, of, sicily, after, the, defeat, of, sextus, now, in, sole, power, octavian, was, occupied, in, wooing, the, aristocracy, to, his, side, he, married, livia, and, started, to, attack, antony, he, argued, that, antony, was, a, man, of, low, morals, to, have, left, his, faithful, wife, abandoned, in, rome, with, the, children, to, be, with, the, promiscuous, queen, of, egypt, several, times, antony, was, summoned, to, rome, but, remained, in, alexandria, with, cleopatra, again, with, egyptian, money, antony, invaded, armenia, this, time, successfully, in, the, return, a, mock, roman, triumph, was, celebrated, in, the, streets, of, alexandria, the, parade, through, the, city, was, a, pastiche, of, rome, s, most, important, military, celebration, for, the, finale, the, whole, city, was, summoned, to, hear, a, very, important, political, statement, surrounded, by, cleopatra, and, her, children, antony, ended, his, alliance, with, octavian, he, distributed, kingdoms, among, his, children, alexander, helios, was, named, king, of, armenia, media, and, parthia, territories, which, were, not, for, the, most, part, under, the, control, of, rome, his, twin, cleopatra, selene, got, cyrenaica, and, libya, and, the, young, ptolemy, philadelphus, was, awarded, syria, and, cilicia, as, for, cleopatra, she, was, proclaimed, queen, of, kings, and, queen, of, egypt, to, rule, with, caesarion, ptolemy, xv, caesar, son, of, cleopatra, by, julius, caesar, king, of, kings, and, king, of, egypt, most, important, of, all, caesarion, was, declared, legitimate, son, and, heir, of, caesar, these, proclamations, were, known, as, the, donations, of, alexandria, and, caused, a, fatal, breach, in, antony, s, relations, with, rome, while, the, distribution, of, nations, among, cleopatra, s, children, was, hardly, a, conciliatory, gesture, it, did, not, pose, an, immediate, threat, to, octavian, s, political, position, far, more, dangerous, was, the, acknowledgment, of, caesarion, as, legitimate, and, heir, to, caesar, s, name, octavian, s, base, of, power, was, his, link, with, caesar, through, adoption, which, granted, him, much, needed, popularity, and, loyalty, of, the, legions, to, see, this, convenient, situation, attacked, by, a, child, borne, by, the, richest, woman, in, the, world, was, something, octavian, could, not, accept, the, triumvirate, expired, on, the, last, day, of, 33, bc, and, was, not, renewed, another, civil, war, was, beginning, during, 33, and, 32, bc, a, propaganda, war, was, fought, in, the, political, arena, of, rome, with, accusations, flying, between, sides, antony, in, egypt, divorced, octavia, and, accused, octavian, of, being, a, social, upstart, of, usurping, power, and, of, forging, the, adoption, papers, by, caesar, octavian, responded, with, treason, charges, of, illegally, keeping, provinces, that, should, be, given, to, other, men, by, lots, as, was, rome, s, tradition, and, of, starting, wars, against, foreign, nations, armenia, and, parthia, without, the, consent, of, the, senate, antony, was, also, held, responsible, for, sextus, pompey, s, execution, without, a, trial, in, 32, bc, the, senate, deprived, him, of, his, powers, and, declared, war, against, cleopatra, not, antony, because, octavian, had, no, wish, to, advertise, his, role, in, perpetuating, rome, s, internecine, bloodshed, octavian, and, other, roman, senators, believed, that, turning, the, hostilities, towards, cleopatra, as, the, villain, would, gather, the, most, support, from, romans, for, war, contributing, to, this, would, be, the, years, of, propaganda, against, cleopatra, published, by, the, romans, dating, back, to, the, days, of, julius, caesar, octavian, informed, of, antony, s, will, by, two, antonian, defectors, sacrilegiously, raided, the, temple, of, vesta, to, secure, it, the, will, which, some, modern, scholars, have, suggested, was, partially, forged, largely, on, legal, grounds, is, never, so, described, in, the, ancient, sources, octavian, s, publication, of, the, will, s, provisions, which, named, antony, and, cleopatra, s, children, as, heirs, and, directed, his, burial, in, alexandria, was, used, as, a, political, weapon, in, rome, to, declare, war, against, cleopatra, and, egypt, as, a, whole, this, was, the, perfect, summation, of, their, attacks, on, the, woman, antony, loved, and, they, believed, threatened, their, republic, both, consuls, gnaeus, domitius, ahenobarbus, and, gaius, sosius, both, antony, s, men, and, a, third, of, the, senate, abandoned, rome, to, meet, antony, and, cleopatra, in, greece, in, 31, bc, the, war, started, octavian, s, general, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, captured, the, greek, city, and, naval, port, of, methone, loyal, to, antony, the, enormous, popularity, of, octavian, with, the, legions, secured, the, defection, of, the, provinces, of, cyrenaica, and, greece, to, his, side, on, 2, september, the, naval, battle, of, actium, took, place, antony, and, cleopatra, s, navy, was, overwhelmed, and, they, were, forced, to, escape, to, egypt, with, 60, ships, octavian, now, close, to, absolute, power, invaded, egypt, with, agrippa, in, august, of, 30, bc, with, no, other, refuge, to, escape, to, antony, stabbed, himself, with, his, sword, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, cleopatra, had, already, done, so, when, he, found, out, that, cleopatra, was, still, alive, his, friends, brought, him, to, cleopatra, s, monument, in, which, she, was, hiding, and, he, died, in, her, arms, cleopatra, was, allowed, to, conduct, antony, s, burial, rites, after, she, had, been, captured, by, octavian, realising, that, she, was, destined, for, octavian, s, triumph, in, rome, she, made, several, attempts, to, take, her, life, and, finally, succeeded, in, mid, august, octavian, had, caesarion, and, antyllus, killed, but, he, spared, iullus, as, well, as, antony, s, children, by, cleopatra, who, were, paraded, through, the, streets, of, rome, cicero, s, son, cicero, minor, announced, antony, s, death, to, the, senate, antony, s, honours, were, revoked, and, his, statues, removed, but, he, was, not, subject, to, a, complete, damnatio, memoriae, cicero, s, son, also, made, a, decree, that, no, member, of, the, antonii, would, ever, bear, the, name, marcus, again, in, this, way, heaven, entrusted, the, family, of, cicero, the, final, acts, in, the, punishment, of, antony, when, antony, died, octavian, became, uncontested, ruler, of, rome, in, the, following, years, octavian, who, was, known, as, augustus, after, 27, bc, managed, to, accumulate, in, his, person, all, administrative, political, and, military, offices, when, augustus, died, in, ad, 14, his, political, powers, passed, to, his, adopted, son, tiberius, the, roman, empire, had, begun, the, rise, of, caesar, and, the, subsequent, civil, war, between, his, two, most, powerful, adherents, effectively, ended, the, credibility, of, the, roman, oligarchy, as, a, governing, power, and, ensured, that, all, future, power, struggles, would, centre, upon, which, one, individual, would, achieve, supreme, control, of, the, government, eliminating, the, senate, and, the, former, magisterial, structure, as, important, foci, of, power, in, these, conflicts, thus, in, history, antony, appears, as, one, of, caesar, s, main, adherents, he, and, octavian, being, the, two, men, around, whom, power, coalesced, following, the, assassination, of, caesar, and, finally, as, one, of, the, three, men, chiefly, responsible, for, the, demise, of, the, republic, antony, had, many, mistresses, including, cytheris, and, was, married, in, succession, to, fadia, antonia, fulvia, octavia, and, cleopatra, he, left, a, number, of, children, through, his, daughters, by, octavia, he, would, be, ancestor, to, the, roman, emperors, caligula, claudius, and, nero, through, his, daughters, by, octavia, he, was, the, paternal, great, grandfather, of, roman, emperor, caligula, the, maternal, grandfather, of, emperor, claudius, and, both, maternal, great, great, grandfather, and, paternal, great, great, uncle, of, the, emperor, nero, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, through, his, eldest, daughter, he, was, ancestor, to, the, long, line, of, kings, and, co, rulers, of, the, bosporan, kingdom, the, longest, living, roman, client, kingdom, as, well, as, the, rulers, and, royalty, of, several, other, roman, client, states, through, his, daughter, by, cleopatra, antony, was, ancestor, to, the, royal, family, of, mauretania, another, roman, client, kingdom, while, through, his, sole, surviving, son, iullus, he, was, ancestor, to, several, famous, roman, statesmen, works, in, which, the, character, of, mark, antony, plays, a, central, role
