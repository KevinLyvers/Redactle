number, of, mining, corporations, were, nationalised, although, the, country, s, banks, such, as, barclays, and, standard, chartered, remained, foreign, owned, the, zambian, economy, suffered, a, setback, from, 1973, when, rising, oil, prices, and, falling, copper, prices, combined, to, reduce, the, state, s, income, from, the, nationalised, mines, the, country, fell, into, debt, with, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, the, third, national, development, plan, had, to, be, abandoned, as, crisis, management, replaced, long, term, planning, his, weak, attempts, at, economic, reforms, in, the, 1980s, hastened, zambia, s, decline, a, number, of, negotiations, with, the, imf, followed, and, by, 1990, kaunda, was, forced, into, partial, privatisation, of, the, state, owned, corporations, the, country, s, economic, woes, ultimately, contributed, to, his, fall, from, power, in, 1964, shortly, before, independence, violence, broke, out, between, supporters, of, the, lumpa, church, led, by, alice, lenshina, kaunda, temporarily, banned, the, church, and, ordered, lumpa, s, arrest, from, 1964, onwards, kaunda, s, government, developed, authoritarian, characteristics, becoming, increasingly, intolerant, of, opposition, kaunda, banned, all, parties, except, unip, following, violence, during, the, 1968, elections, however, in, early, 1972, he, faced, a, new, threat, in, the, form, of, simon, kapwepwe, s, decision, to, leave, unip, and, found, a, rival, party, the, united, progressive, party, which, kaunda, immediately, attempted, to, suppress, next, he, appointed, the, chona, commission, which, was, set, up, under, the, chairmanship, of, mainza, chona, in, february, 1972, chona, s, task, was, to, make, recommendations, for, a, new, zambian, constitution, which, would, effectively, reduce, the, nation, to, a, one, party, state, the, commission, s, terms, of, reference, did, not, permit, it, to, discuss, the, possible, faults, of, kaunda, s, decision, but, instead, to, concentrate, on, the, practical, details, of, the, move, to, a, one, party, state, finally, kaunda, neutralised, nkumbula, by, getting, him, to, join, unip, and, accept, the, choma, declaration, on, 27, june, 1973, the, new, constitution, was, formally, promulgated, on, 25, august, of, that, year, at, the, first, elections, under, the, new, system, held, that,

ideology, called, zambian, humanism, this, was, based, on, a, combination, of, mid, 20th, century, ideas, of, central, planning, state, control, and, what, he, considered, basic, african, values, mutual, aid, trust, and, loyalty, to, the, community, similar, forms, of, african, socialism, were, introduced, inter, alia, in, ghana, by, kwame, nkrumah, consciencism, and, tanzania, by, julius, nyerere, ujamaa, to, elaborate, on, his, ideology, kaunda, published, several, books, humanism, in, zambia, and, a, guide, to, its, implementation, parts, 1, 2, and, 3, other, publications, on,

the, party, s, constitution, to, bring, in, rules, that, invalidated, the, challengers, nominations, kapwepwe, was, told, he, could, not, stand, because, only, people, who, had, been, members, for, five, years, could, be, nominated, to, the, presidency, he, had, only, rejoined, unip, three, years, before, nkumbula, and, a, third, contender, businessman, robert, chiluwe, were, outmanoeuvred, by, introducing, a, new, rule, that, said, each, candidate, needed, the, signatures, of, 200, delegates, from, each, province, to, back, their, candidacy, during, his, early, presidency, kaunda, was, an, outspoken, supporter, of, the, anti, apartheid, movement, and, opposed, white, minority, rule, in, southern, rhodesia, although, his, nationalisation, of, the, copper, mining, industry, in, the, late, 1960s, and, the, volatility, of, international, copper, prices, contributed, to, increased, economic, problems, matters, were, aggravated, by, his, logistical, support, for, the, black, nationalist, movements, in, ian, smith, s, rhodesia, south, west, africa, angola, and, mozambique, kaunda, s, administration, later, attempted, to, serve, the, role, of, a, mediator, between, the, entrenched, white, minority, and, colonial, governments, and, the, various, guerrilla, movements, which, were, aimed, at, overthrowing, these, respective, administrations, beginning, in, the, early, 1970s, he, began, permitting, the, most, prominent, guerrilla, organisations, such, as, the, rhodesian, zanu, and, the, african, national, congress, to, use, zambia, as, a, base, for, their, operations, former,

jets, from, the, soviet, union, which, ultimately, provoked, a, reaction, from, the, united, states, kaunda, responded, to, the, united, states, stating, that, after, numerous, failed, attempts, to, purchase, weapons, buying, from, the, soviets, was, justified, in, his, duty, to, protect, his, citizens, and, zambian, national, security, his, attempted, purchase, of, modern, american, weapons, may, have, been, a, political, tactic, to, use, fear, to, establish, his, one, party, rule, over, zambia, from, april, 1975, when, he, visited, us, president, gerald, ford, at, the, white, house, in,
