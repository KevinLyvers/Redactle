edward, teach, or, thatch, c, 1680, 22, november, 1718, better, known, as, blackbeard, was, an, english, pirate, who, operated, around, the, west, indies, and, the, eastern, coast, of, britain, s, north, american, colonies, little, is, known, about, his, early, life, but, he, may, have, been, a, sailor, on, privateer, ships, during, queen, anne, s, war, before, he, settled, on, the, bahamian, island, of, new, providence, a, base, for, captain, benjamin, hornigold, whose, crew, teach, joined, around, 1716, hornigold, placed, him, in, command, of, a, sloop, that, he, had, captured, and, the, two, engaged, in, numerous, acts, of, piracy, their, numbers, were, boosted, by, the, addition, to, their, fleet, of, two, more, ships, one, of, which, was, commanded, by, stede, bonnet, but, hornigold, retired, from, piracy, toward, the, end, of, 1717, taking, two, vessels, with, him, teach, captured, a, french, slave, ship, known, as, la, concorde, renamed, her, queen, anne, s, revenge, equipped, her, with, 40, guns, and, crewed, her, with, over, 300, men, he, became, a, renowned, pirate, his, nickname, derived, from, his, thick, black, beard, and, fearsome, appearance, he, was, reported, to, have, tied, lit, fuses, slow, matches, under, his, hat, to, frighten, his, enemies, he, formed, an, alliance, of, pirates, and, blockaded, the, port, of, charles, town, south, carolina, ransoming, the, port, s, inhabitants, he, then, ran, queen, anne, s, revenge, aground, on, a, sandbar, near, beaufort, north, carolina, he, parted, company, with, stede, bonnet, and, settled, in, bath, north, carolina, also, known, as, bath, town, where, he, accepted, a, royal, pardon, however, he, was, soon, back, at, sea, where, he, attracted, the, attention, of, alexander, spotswood, the, governor, of, virginia, spotswood, arranged, for, a, party, of, soldiers, and, sailors, to, capture, him, on, 22, november, 1718, following, a, ferocious, battle, teach, and, several, of, his, crew, were, killed, by, a, small, force, of, sailors, led, by, lieutenant, robert, maynard, teach, was, a, shrewd, and, calculating, leader, who, spurned, the, use, of, violence, relying, instead, on, his, fearsome, image, to, elicit, the, response, that, he, desired, from, those, whom, he, robbed, he, was, romanticised, after, his, death, and, became, the, inspiration, for, an, archetypal, pirate, in, works, of, fiction, across, many, genres, little, is, known, about, blackbeard, s, early, life, it, is, commonly, believed, that, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, between, 35, and, 40, years, old, and, thus, born, around, 1680, in, contemporary, records, his, name, is, most, often, given, as, blackbeard, edward, thatch, or, edward, teach, the, latter, is, most, often, used, because, it, is, the, form, used, in, the, dispatches, of, north, america, s, only, newspaper, at, the, time, the, boston, news, letter, but, primary, sources, written, by, people, who, had, actually, met, the, pirate, all, refer, to, him, as, thatch, or, variations, thereof, several, spellings, of, his, surname, exist, thatch, thach, thache, thack, tack, thatche, and, theach, one, source, claims, that, his, surname, was, drummond, but, the, lack, of, any, supporting, documentation, makes, this, unlikely, pirates, habitually, used, fictitious, surnames, while, engaged, in, piracy, so, as, not, to, tarnish, the, family, name, which, makes, it, unlikely, that, teach, s, real, name, will, ever, be, known, the, 17th, century, rise, of, britain, s, american, colonies, and, the, rapid, 18th, century, expansion, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, had, made, bristol, an, important, international, sea, port, and, teach, was, most, likely, raised, in, what, was, then, the, second, largest, city, in, england, he, could, almost, certainly, read, and, write, he, communicated, with, merchants, and, when, killed, had, in, his, possession, a, letter, addressed, to, him, by, the, chief, justice, and, secretary, of, the, province, of, carolina, tobias, knight, author, robert, lee, speculated, that, teach, may, therefore, have, been, born, into, a, respectable, wealthy, family, he, may, have, arrived, in, the, caribbean, in, the, last, years, of, the, 17th, century, on, a, merchant, vessel, possibly, a, slave, ship, the, 18th, century, author, charles, johnson, claimed, that, teach, was, for, some, time, a, sailor, operating, from, jamaica, on, privateer, ships, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, that, he, had, often, distinguished, himself, for, his, uncommon, boldness, and, personal, courage, it, is, unknown, at, what, point, during, the, war, teach, joined, the, fighting, as, with, the, record, of, most, of, his, life, before, he, became, a, pirate, with, its, history, of, colonialism, trade, and, piracy, the, west, indies, was, the, setting, for, many, 17th, and, 18th, century, maritime, incidents, the, privateer, turned, pirate, henry, jennings, and, his, followers, decided, early, in, the, 18th, century, to, use, the, uninhabited, island, of, new, providence, as, a, base, for, their, operations, since, it, was, within, easy, reach, of, the, florida, strait, and, its, busy, shipping, lanes, which, were, filled, with, european, vessels, crossing, the, atlantic, new, providence, s, harbour, could, easily, accommodate, hundreds, of, ships, but, was, too, shallow, for, the, royal, navy, s, larger, vessels, the, author, george, woodbury, described, new, providence, as, no, city, of, homes, it, was, a, place, of, temporary, sojourn, and, refreshment, for, a, literally, floating, population, continuing, the, only, permanent, residents, were, the, piratical, camp, followers, the, traders, and, the, hangers, on, all, others, were, transient, in, new, providence, pirates, found, a, welcome, respite, from, the, law, teach, was, one, of, those, who, came, to, enjoy, the, island, s, benefits, probably, shortly, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, he, moved, there, from, jamaica, and, along, with, most, privateers, once, involved, in, the, war, became, involved, in, piracy, possibly, about, 1716, he, joined, the, crew, of, captain, benjamin, hornigold, a, renowned, pirate, who, operated, from, new, providence, s, safe, waters, in, 1716, hornigold, placed, teach, in, charge, of, a, sloop, he, had, taken, as, a, prize, in, early, 1717, hornigold, and, teach, each, captaining, a, sloop, set, out, for, the, mainland, they, captured, a, boat, carrying, 120, barrels, of, flour, out, of, havana, and, shortly, thereafter, took, 100, barrels, of, wine, from, a, sloop, out, of, bermuda, a, few, days, later, they, stopped, a, vessel, sailing, from, madeira, to, charles, town, south, carolina, teach, and, his, quartermaster, william, howard, may, at, this, time, have, struggled, to, control, their, crews, by, then, they, had, probably, developed, a, taste, for, madeira, wine, and, on, 29, september, near, cape, charles, all, they, took, from, the, betty, of, virginia, was, her, cargo, of, madeira, before, they, scuttled, her, with, the, remaining, cargo, it, was, during, this, cruise, with, hornigold, that, the, earliest, known, report, of, teach, was, made, in, which, he, is, recorded, as, a, pirate, in, his, own, right, in, command, of, a, large, crew, in, a, report, made, by, a, captain, mathew, munthe, on, an, anti, piracy, patrol, for, north, carolina, thatch, was, described, as, operating, a, sloop, 6, gunns, and, about, 70, men, in, september, teach, and, hornigold, encountered, stede, bonnet, a, landowner, and, military, officer, from, a, wealthy, family, who, had, turned, to, piracy, earlier, that, year, bonnet, s, crew, of, about, 70, were, reportedly, dissatisfied, with, his, command, so, with, bonnet, s, permission, teach, took, control, of, his, ship, revenge, the, pirates, flotilla, now, consisted, of, three, ships, teach, on, revenge, teach, s, old, sloop, and, hornigold, s, ranger, by, october, another, vessel, had, been, captured, and, added, to, the, small, fleet, the, sloops, robert, of, philadelphia, and, good, intent, of, dublin, were, stopped, on, 22, october, 1717, and, their, cargo, holds, emptied, as, a, former, british, privateer, hornigold, attacked, only, his, old, enemies, but, for, his, crew, the, sight, of, british, vessels, filled, with, valuable, cargo, passing, by, unharmed, became, too, much, and, at, some, point, toward, the, end, of, 1717, he, was, demoted, whether, teach, had, any, involvement, in, this, decision, is, unknown, but, hornigold, quickly, retired, from, piracy, he, took, ranger, and, one, of, the, sloops, leaving, teach, with, revenge, and, the, remaining, sloop, the, two, never, met, again, and, as, did, many, other, occupants, of, new, providence, hornigold, accepted, the, king, s, pardon, on, 28, november, 1717, teach, s, two, ships, attacked, a, french, merchant, vessel, off, the, coast, of, saint, vincent, they, each, fired, a, broadside, across, its, bulwarks, killing, several, of, its, crew, and, forcing, its, captain, to, surrender, the, ship, was, la, concorde, a, large, french, guineaman, registered, in, saint, malo, and, carrying, a, cargo, of, slaves, this, ship, had, originally, been, the, english, merchantman, concord, captured, in, 1711, by, a, french, squadron, and, then, changed, hands, several, times, by, 1717, teach, and, his, crews, sailed, the, vessel, south, along, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, to, bequia, where, they, disembarked, her, crew, and, cargo, and, converted, the, ship, for, their, own, use, the, crew, of, la, concorde, were, given, the, smaller, of, teach, s, two, sloops, which, they, renamed, mauvaise, rencontre, bad, meeting, and, sailed, for, martinique, teach, may, have, recruited, some, of, their, slaves, but, the, remainder, were, left, on, the, island, and, were, later, recaptured, by, the, returning, crew, of, mauvaise, rencontre, teach, immediately, renamed, la, concorde, as, queen, anne, s, revenge, and, equipped, her, with, 40, guns, by, this, time, teach, had, placed, his, lieutenant, richards, in, command, of, bonnet, s, revenge, in, late, november, near, saint, vincent, he, attacked, the, great, allen, after, a, lengthy, engagement, he, forced, the, large, and, well, armed, merchant, ship, to, surrender, he, ordered, her, to, move, closer, to, the, shore, disembarked, her, crew, and, emptied, her, cargo, holds, and, then, burned, and, sank, the, vessel, the, incident, was, chronicled, in, the, boston, news, letter, which, called, teach, the, commander, of, a, french, ship, of, 32, guns, a, briganteen, of, 10, guns, and, a, sloop, of, 12, guns, it, is, not, known, when, or, where, teach, collected, the, ten, gun, briganteen, but, by, that, time, he, may, have, been, in, command, of, at, least, 150, men, split, among, three, vessels, on, 5, december, 1717, teach, stopped, the, merchant, sloop, margaret, off, the, coast, of, crab, island, near, anguilla, her, captain, henry, bostock, and, crew, remained, teach, s, prisoners, for, about, eight, hours, and, were, forced, to, watch, as, their, sloop, was, ransacked, bostock, who, had, been, held, aboard, queen, anne, s, revenge, was, returned, unharmed, to, margaret, and, was, allowed, to, leave, with, his, crew, he, returned, to, his, base, of, operations, on, saint, christopher, island, and, reported, the, matter, to, governor, walter, hamilton, who, requested, that, he, sign, an, affidavit, about, the, encounter, bostock, s, deposition, details, teach, s, command, of, two, vessels, a, sloop, and, a, large, french, guineaman, dutch, built, with, 36, cannons, and, a, crew, of, 300, men, the, captain, believed, that, the, larger, ship, carried, valuable, gold, dust, silver, plate, and, a, very, fine, cup, supposedly, taken, from, the, commander, of, great, allen, teach, s, crew, had, apparently, informed, bostock, that, they, had, destroyed, several, other, vessels, and, that, they, intended, to, sail, to, hispaniola, and, lie, in, wait, for, an, expected, spanish, armada, supposedly, laden, with, money, to, pay, the, garrisons, bostock, also, claimed, that, teach, had, questioned, him, about, the, movements, of, local, ships, but, also, that, he, had, seemed, unsurprised, when, bostock, told, him, of, an, expected, royal, pardon, from, london, for, all, pirates, so, our, heroe, captain, teach, assumed, the, cognomen, of, black, beard, from, that, large, quantity, of, hair, which, like, a, frightful, meteor, covered, his, whole, face, and, frightened, america, more, than, any, comet, that, has, appeared, there, a, long, time, this, beard, was, black, which, he, suffered, to, grow, of, an, extravagant, length, as, to, breadth, it, came, up, to, his, eyes, he, was, accustomed, to, twist, it, with, ribbons, in, small, tails, after, the, manner, of, our, ramilies, wiggs, and, turn, them, about, his, ears, charles, johnson, bostock, s, deposition, describes, teach, as, a, tall, spare, man, with, a, very, black, beard, which, he, wore, very, long, it, is, the, first, recorded, account, of, teach, s, appearance, and, is, the, source, of, his, nickname, blackbeard, later, descriptions, mention, that, his, thick, black, beard, was, braided, into, pigtails, sometimes, tied, in, with, small, coloured, ribbons, johnson, 1724, described, him, as, such, a, figure, that, imagination, cannot, form, an, idea, of, a, fury, from, hell, to, look, more, frightful, whether, johnson, s, description, was, entirely, truthful, or, embellished, is, unclear, but, it, seems, likely, that, teach, understood, the, value, of, appearances, better, to, strike, fear, into, the, heart, of, one, s, enemies, than, rely, on, bluster, alone, teach, was, tall, with, broad, shoulders, he, wore, knee, length, boots, and, dark, clothing, topped, with, a, wide, hat, and, sometimes, a, long, coat, of, brightly, coloured, silk, or, velvet, johnson, also, described, teach, in, times, of, battle, as, wearing, a, sling, over, his, shoulders, with, three, brace, of, pistols, hanging, in, holsters, like, bandoliers, and, stuck, lighted, slow, matches, under, his, hat, the, latter, apparently, to, emphasise, the, fearsome, appearance, he, wished, to, present, to, his, enemies, despite, his, ferocious, reputation, there, are, no, verified, accounts, of, his, ever, having, murdered, or, harmed, those, he, held, captive, teach, may, have, used, other, aliases, on, 30, november, the, monserrat, merchant, encountered, two, ships, and, a, sloop, commanded, by, a, captain, kentish, and, captain, edwards, the, latter, a, known, alias, of, stede, bonnet, teach, s, movements, between, late, 1717, and, early, 1718, are, not, known, he, and, bonnet, were, probably, responsible, for, an, attack, off, sint, eustatius, in, december, 1717, henry, bostock, claimed, to, have, heard, the, pirates, say, they, would, head, toward, the, spanish, controlled, saman, bay, in, hispaniola, but, a, cursory, search, revealed, no, pirate, activity, captain, hume, of, hms, scarborough, reported, on, 6, february, that, a, pyrate, ship, of, 36, guns, and, 250, men, and, a, sloop, of, 10, guns, and, 100, men, were, said, to, be, cruizing, amongst, the, leeward, islands, hume, reinforced, his, crew, with, soldiers, armed, with, muskets, and, joined, up, with, hms, seaford, to, track, the, two, ships, to, no, avail, though, they, discovered, that, the, two, ships, had, sunk, a, french, vessel, off, st, christopher, island, and, reported, also, that, they, had, last, been, seen, gone, down, the, north, side, of, hispaniola, although, no, confirmation, exists, that, these, two, ships, were, controlled, by, teach, and, bonnet, author, angus, konstam, believes, it, very, likely, they, were, in, march, 1718, while, taking, on, water, at, turneffe, island, east, of, belize, both, ships, spotted, the, jamaican, logwood, cutting, sloop, adventure, making, for, the, harbour, she, was, stopped, and, her, captain, harriot, invited, to, join, the, pirates, harriot, and, his, crew, accepted, the, invitation, and, teach, sent, over, a, crew, to, sail, adventure, making, israel, hands, the, captain, they, sailed, for, the, bay, of, honduras, where, they, added, another, ship, and, four, sloops, to, their, flotilla, on, 9, april, teach, s, enlarged, fleet, of, ships, looted, and, burnt, protestant, caesar, his, fleet, then, sailed, to, grand, cayman, where, they, captured, a, small, turtler, teach, probably, sailed, toward, havana, where, he, may, have, captured, a, small, spanish, vessel, that, had, left, the, cuban, port, they, then, sailed, to, the, wrecks, of, the, 1715, spanish, fleet, off, the, eastern, coast, of, florida, there, teach, disembarked, the, crew, of, the, captured, spanish, sloop, before, proceeding, north, to, the, port, of, charles, town, south, carolina, attacking, three, vessels, along, the, way, by, may, 1718, teach, had, awarded, himself, the, rank, of, commodore, and, was, at, the, height, of, his, power, late, that, month, his, flotilla, blockaded, the, port, of, charles, town, in, the, province, of, south, carolina, all, vessels, entering, or, leaving, the, port, were, stopped, and, as, the, town, had, no, guard, ship, its, pilot, boat, was, the, first, to, be, captured, over, the, next, five, or, six, days, about, nine, vessels, were, stopped, and, ransacked, as, they, attempted, to, sail, past, charles, town, bar, where, teach, s, fleet, was, anchored, one, such, ship, headed, for, london, with, a, group, of, prominent, charles, town, citizens, which, included, samuel, wragg, a, member, of, the, council, of, the, province, of, carolina, was, the, crowley, her, passengers, were, questioned, about, the, vessels, still, in, port, and, then, locked, below, decks, for, about, half, a, day, teach, informed, the, prisoners, that, his, fleet, required, medical, supplies, from, the, colonial, government, of, south, carolina, and, that, if, none, were, forthcoming, all, prisoners, would, be, executed, their, heads, sent, to, the, governor, and, all, captured, ships, burnt, wragg, agreed, to, teach, s, demands, and, a, mr, marks, and, two, pirates, were, given, two, days, to, collect, the, drugs, teach, moved, his, fleet, and, the, captured, ships, to, within, about, five, or, six, leagues, from, land, three, days, later, a, messenger, sent, by, marks, returned, to, the, fleet, marks, s, boat, had, capsized, and, delayed, their, arrival, in, charles, town, teach, granted, a, reprieve, of, two, days, but, still, the, party, did, not, return, he, then, called, a, meeting, of, his, fellow, sailors, and, moved, eight, ships, into, the, harbour, causing, panic, within, the, town, when, marks, finally, returned, to, the, fleet, he, explained, what, had, happened, on, his, arrival, he, had, presented, the, pirates, demands, to, the, governor, and, the, drugs, had, been, quickly, gathered, but, the, two, pirates, sent, to, escort, him, had, proved, difficult, to, find, they, had, been, busy, drinking, with, friends, and, were, finally, discovered, drunk, teach, kept, to, his, side, of, the, bargain, and, released, the, captured, ships, and, his, prisoners, albeit, relieved, of, their, valuables, including, the, fine, clothing, some, had, worn, whilst, at, charles, town, teach, learned, that, woodes, rogers, had, left, england, with, several, men, of, war, with, orders, to, purge, the, west, indies, of, pirates, teach, s, flotilla, sailed, northward, along, the, atlantic, coast, and, into, topsail, inlet, commonly, known, as, beaufort, inlet, off, the, coast, of, north, carolina, there, they, intended, to, careen, their, ships, to, scrape, their, hulls, but, on, 10, june, 1718, the, queen, anne, s, revenge, ran, aground, on, a, sandbar, cracking, her, main, mast, and, severely, damaging, many, of, her, timbers, teach, ordered, several, sloops, to, throw, ropes, across, the, flagship, in, an, attempt, to, free, her, a, sloop, commanded, by, israel, hands, of, adventure, also, ran, aground, and, both, vessels, appeared, to, be, damaged, beyond, repair, leaving, only, revenge, and, the, captured, spanish, sloop, teach, had, at, some, stage, learnt, of, the, offer, of, a, royal, pardon, and, probably, confided, in, bonnet, his, willingness, to, accept, it, the, pardon, was, open, to, all, pirates, who, surrendered, on, or, before, 5, september, 1718, but, contained, a, caveat, stipulating, that, immunity, was, offered, only, against, crimes, committed, before, 5, january, although, in, theory, this, left, bonnet, and, teach, at, risk, of, being, hanged, for, their, actions, at, charles, town, bar, most, authorities, could, waive, such, conditions, teach, thought, that, governor, charles, eden, was, a, man, he, could, trust, but, to, make, sure, he, waited, to, see, what, would, happen, to, another, captain, bonnet, left, immediately, on, a, small, sailing, boat, for, bath, town, where, he, surrendered, to, governor, eden, and, received, his, pardon, he, then, travelled, back, to, beaufort, inlet, to, collect, the, revenge, and, the, remainder, of, his, crew, intending, to, sail, to, saint, thomas, island, to, receive, a, commission, unfortunately, for, him, teach, had, stripped, the, vessel, of, its, valuables, and, provisions, and, had, marooned, its, crew, bonnet, set, out, for, revenge, but, was, unable, to, find, him, he, and, his, crew, returned, to, piracy, and, were, captured, on, 27, september, 1718, at, the, mouth, of, the, cape, fear, river, all, but, four, were, tried, and, hanged, in, charles, town, the, author, robert, lee, surmised, that, teach, and, hands, intentionally, ran, the, ships, aground, to, reduce, the, fleet, s, crew, complement, increasing, their, share, of, the, spoils, during, the, trial, of, bonnet, s, crew, revenge, s, boatswain, ignatius, pell, testified, that, the, ship, was, run, ashore, and, lost, which, thatch, caused, to, be, done, lee, considers, it, plausible, that, teach, let, bonnet, in, on, his, plan, to, accept, a, pardon, from, governor, eden, he, suggested, that, bonnet, do, the, same, and, as, war, between, the, quadruple, alliance, of, 1718, and, spain, was, threatening, to, consider, taking, a, privateer, s, commission, from, england, lee, suggests, that, teach, also, offered, bonnet, the, return, of, his, ship, revenge, konstam, 2007, proposes, a, similar, idea, explaining, that, teach, began, to, see, queen, anne, s, revenge, as, something, of, a, liability, while, a, pirate, fleet, was, anchored, news, of, this, was, sent, to, neighbouring, towns, and, colonies, and, any, vessels, nearby, would, delay, sailing, it, was, prudent, therefore, for, teach, not, to, linger, for, too, long, although, wrecking, the, ship, was, an, extreme, measure, before, sailing, northward, on, his, remaining, sloop, to, ocracoke, inlet, teach, marooned, about, 25, men, on, a, small, sandy, island, about, 5, km, from, the, mainland, he, may, have, done, this, to, stifle, any, protest, they, made, if, they, guessed, their, captain, s, plans, bonnet, rescued, them, two, days, later, teach, continued, on, to, bath, where, in, june, 1718, only, days, after, bonnet, had, departed, with, his, pardon, he, and, his, much, reduced, crew, received, their, pardon, from, governor, eden, he, settled, in, bath, on, the, eastern, side, of, bath, creek, at, plum, point, near, eden, s, home, during, july, and, august, he, travelled, between, his, base, in, the, town, and, his, sloop, off, ocracoke, johnson, s, account, states, that, he, married, the, daughter, of, a, local, plantation, owner, although, there, is, no, supporting, evidence, for, this, eden, gave, teach, permission, to, sail, to, st, thomas, to, seek, a, commission, as, a, privateer, a, useful, way, of, removing, bored, and, troublesome, pirates, from, the, small, settlement, and, teach, was, given, official, title, to, his, remaining, sloop, which, he, renamed, adventure, by, the, end, of, august, he, had, returned, to, piracy, and, in, the, same, month, the, governor, of, pennsylvania, issued, a, warrant, for, his, arrest, but, by, then, teach, was, probably, operating, in, delaware, bay, some, distance, away, he, took, two, french, ships, leaving, the, caribbean, moved, one, crew, across, to, the, other, and, sailed, the, remaining, ship, back, to, ocracoke, in, september, he, told, eden, that, he, had, found, the, french, ship, at, sea, deserted, a, vice, admiralty, court, was, quickly, convened, presided, over, by, tobias, knight, and, the, collector, of, customs, the, ship, was, judged, as, a, derelict, found, at, sea, and, of, its, cargo, twenty, hogsheads, of, sugar, were, awarded, to, knight, and, sixty, to, eden, teach, and, his, crew, were, given, what, remained, in, the, vessel, s, hold, ocracoke, inlet, was, teach, s, favourite, anchorage, it, was, a, perfect, vantage, point, from, which, to, view, ships, travelling, between, the, various, settlements, of, northeast, carolina, and, it, was, from, there, that, teach, first, spotted, the, approaching, ship, of, charles, vane, another, english, pirate, several, months, earlier, vane, had, rejected, the, pardon, brought, by, woodes, rogers, and, escaped, the, men, of, war, the, english, captain, brought, with, him, to, nassau, he, had, also, been, pursued, by, teach, s, old, commander, benjamin, hornigold, who, was, by, then, a, pirate, hunter, teach, and, vane, spent, several, nights, on, the, southern, tip, of, ocracoke, island, accompanied, by, such, notorious, figures, as, israel, hands, robert, deal, and, calico, jack, as, it, spread, throughout, the, neighbouring, colonies, the, news, of, teach, and, vane, s, impromptu, party, worried, the, governor, of, pennsylvania, enough, to, send, out, two, sloops, to, capture, the, pirates, they, were, unsuccessful, but, governor, of, virginia, alexander, spotswood, was, also, concerned, that, the, supposedly, retired, freebooter, and, his, crew, were, living, in, nearby, north, carolina, some, of, teach, s, former, crew, had, already, moved, into, several, virginian, seaport, towns, prompting, spotswood, to, issue, a, proclamation, on, 10, july, requiring, all, former, pirates, to, make, themselves, known, to, the, authorities, to, give, up, their, arms, and, to, not, travel, in, groups, larger, than, three, as, head, of, a, crown, colony, spotswood, viewed, the, proprietary, colony, of, north, carolina, with, contempt, he, had, little, faith, in, the, ability, of, the, carolinians, to, control, the, pirates, who, he, suspected, would, be, back, to, their, old, ways, disrupting, virginian, commerce, as, soon, as, their, money, ran, out, spotswood, learned, that, william, howard, the, former, quartermaster, of, queen, anne, s, revenge, was, in, the, area, and, believing, that, he, might, know, of, teach, s, whereabouts, had, him, and, his, two, slaves, arrested, spotswood, had, no, legal, authority, to, have, pirates, tried, and, as, a, result, howard, s, attorney, john, holloway, brought, charges, against, captain, brand, of, hms, lyme, where, howard, was, imprisoned, he, also, sued, on, howard, s, behalf, for, damages, of, 500, claiming, wrongful, arrest, spotswood, s, council, claimed, that, under, a, statute, of, william, iii, the, governor, was, entitled, to, try, pirates, without, a, jury, in, times, of, crisis, and, that, teach, s, presence, was, a, crisis, the, charges, against, howard, referred, to, several, acts, of, piracy, supposedly, committed, after, the, pardon, s, cut, off, date, in, a, sloop, belonging, to, ye, subjects, of, the, king, of, spain, but, ignored, the, fact, that, they, took, place, outside, spotswood, s, jurisdiction, and, in, a, vessel, then, legally, owned, another, charge, cited, two, attacks, one, of, which, was, the, capture, of, a, slave, ship, off, charles, town, bar, from, which, one, of, howard, s, slaves, was, presumed, to, have, come, howard, was, sent, to, await, trial, before, a, court, of, vice, admiralty, on, the, charge, of, piracy, but, brand, and, his, colleague, captain, gordon, of, hms, pearl, refused, to, serve, with, holloway, present, incensed, holloway, had, no, option, but, to, stand, down, and, was, replaced, by, the, attorney, general, of, virginia, john, clayton, whom, spotswood, described, as, an, honester, man, howard, was, found, guilty, and, sentenced, to, be, hanged, but, was, saved, by, a, commission, from, london, which, directed, spotswood, to, pardon, all, acts, of, piracy, committed, by, surrendering, pirates, before, 18, august, 1718, spotswood, had, obtained, from, howard, valuable, information, on, teach, s, whereabouts, and, he, planned, to, send, his, forces, across, the, border, into, north, carolina, to, capture, him, he, gained, the, support, of, two, men, keen, to, discredit, north, carolina, s, governor, edward, moseley, and, colonel, maurice, moore, he, also, wrote, to, the, lords, of, trade, suggesting, that, the, crown, might, benefit, financially, from, teach, s, capture, spotswood, personally, financed, the, operation, possibly, believing, that, teach, had, fabulous, treasures, hidden, away, he, ordered, captains, gordon, and, brand, of, hms, pearl, and, hms, lyme, to, travel, overland, to, bath, lieutenant, robert, maynard, of, hms, pearl, was, given, command, of, two, commandeered, sloops, to, approach, the, town, from, the, sea, an, extra, incentive, for, teach, s, capture, was, the, offer, of, a, reward, from, the, assembly, of, virginia, over, and, above, any, that, might, be, received, from, the, crown, maynard, took, command, of, the, two, armed, sloops, on, 17, november, he, was, given, 57, men, 33, from, hms, pearl, and, 24, from, hms, lyme, maynard, and, the, detachment, from, hms, pearl, took, the, larger, of, the, two, vessels, and, named, her, jane, the, rest, took, ranger, commanded, by, one, of, maynard, s, officers, a, mister, hyde, some, from, the, two, ships, civilian, crews, remained, aboard, they, sailed, from, kecoughtan, along, the, james, river, on, 17, november, the, two, sloops, moved, slowly, giving, brand, s, force, time, to, reach, bath, brand, set, out, for, north, carolina, six, days, later, arriving, within, three, miles, of, bath, on, 23, november, included, in, brand, s, force, were, several, north, carolinians, including, colonel, moore, and, captain, jeremiah, vail, sent, to, counter, any, local, objection, to, the, presence, of, foreign, soldiers, moore, went, into, the, town, to, see, if, teach, was, there, reporting, back, that, he, was, not, but, that, he, was, expected, at, every, minute, brand, then, went, to, governor, eden, s, home, and, informed, him, of, his, purpose, the, next, day, brand, sent, two, canoes, down, pamlico, river, to, ocracoke, inlet, to, see, if, teach, could, be, seen, they, returned, two, days, later, and, reported, on, what, eventually, transpired, maynard, found, the, pirates, anchored, on, the, inner, side, of, ocracoke, island, on, the, evening, of, 21, november, he, had, ascertained, their, position, from, ships, he, had, stopped, along, his, journey, but, being, unfamiliar, with, the, local, channels, and, shoals, he, decided, to, wait, until, the, following, morning, to, make, his, attack, he, stopped, all, traffic, from, entering, the, inlet, preventing, any, warning, of, his, presence, and, posted, a, lookout, on, both, sloops, to, ensure, that, teach, could, not, escape, to, sea, on, the, other, side, of, the, island, teach, was, busy, entertaining, guests, and, had, not, set, a, lookout, with, israel, hands, ashore, in, bath, with, about, 24, of, adventure, s, sailors, he, also, had, a, much, reduced, crew, johnson, 1724, reported, teach, had, no, more, than, twenty, five, men, on, board, and, that, he, gave, out, to, all, the, vessels, that, he, spoke, with, that, he, had, forty, thirteen, white, and, six, negroes, was, the, number, later, reported, by, brand, to, the, admiralty, damn, you, for, villains, who, are, you, and, from, whence, came, you, the, lieutenant, made, him, answer, you, may, see, by, our, colours, we, are, no, pyrates, black, beard, bid, him, send, his, boat, on, board, that, he, might, see, who, he, was, but, mr, maynard, reply, d, thus, i, cannot, spare, my, boat, but, i, will, come, aboard, of, you, as, soon, as, i, can, with, my, sloop, upon, this, black, beard, took, a, glass, of, liquor, and, drank, to, him, with, these, words, damnation, seize, my, soul, if, i, give, you, quarters, or, take, any, from, you, in, answer, to, which, mr, maynard, told, him, that, he, expected, no, quarters, from, him, nor, should, he, give, him, any, reported, exchange, of, views, between, teach, and, maynard, at, daybreak, preceded, by, a, small, boat, taking, soundings, maynard, s, two, sloops, entered, the, channel, the, small, craft, was, quickly, spotted, by, adventure, and, fired, at, as, soon, as, it, was, within, range, of, her, guns, while, the, boat, made, a, quick, retreat, to, the, jane, teach, cut, the, adventure, s, anchor, cable, his, crew, hoisted, the, sails, and, the, adventure, manoeuvred, to, point, her, starboard, guns, toward, maynard, s, sloops, which, were, slowly, closing, the, gap, hyde, moved, ranger, to, the, port, side, of, jane, and, the, union, flag, was, unfurled, on, each, ship, adventure, then, turned, toward, the, beach, of, ocracoke, island, heading, for, a, narrow, channel, what, happened, next, is, uncertain, johnson, claimed, that, there, was, an, exchange, of, small, arms, fire, following, which, adventure, ran, aground, on, a, sandbar, and, maynard, anchored, and, then, lightened, his, ship, to, pass, over, the, obstacle, another, version, claimed, that, jane, and, ranger, ran, aground, although, maynard, made, no, mention, of, this, in, his, log, the, adventure, eventually, turned, her, guns, on, the, two, ships, and, fired, the, broadside, was, devastating, in, an, instant, maynard, had, lost, as, much, as, a, third, of, his, forces, about, 20, on, jane, were, either, wounded, or, killed, and, 9, on, ranger, hyde, was, dead, and, his, second, and, third, officers, either, dead, or, seriously, injured, his, sloop, was, so, badly, damaged, that, it, played, no, further, role, in, the, attack, contemporary, accounts, of, what, happened, next, are, confused, but, small, arms, fire, from, jane, may, have, cut, adventure, s, jib, sheet, causing, her, to, lose, control, and, run, onto, the, sandbar, in, the, aftermath, of, teach, s, overwhelming, attack, jane, and, ranger, may, also, have, been, grounded, the, battle, would, have, become, a, race, to, see, who, could, float, their, ship, first, maynard, had, kept, many, of, his, men, below, deck, and, in, anticipation, of, being, boarded, told, them, to, prepare, for, close, fighting, teach, watched, as, the, gap, between, the, vessels, closed, and, ordered, his, men, to, be, ready, the, two, vessels, contacted, one, another, as, the, adventure, s, grappling, hooks, hit, their, target, and, several, grenades, made, from, powder, and, shot, filled, bottles, and, ignited, by, fuses, broke, across, the, sloop, s, deck, as, the, smoke, cleared, teach, led, his, men, aboard, buoyant, at, the, sight, of, maynard, s, apparently, empty, ship, his, men, firing, at, the, small, group, of, men, with, maynard, at, the, stern, the, rest, of, maynard, s, men, then, burst, from, the, hold, shouting, and, firing, the, plan, to, surprise, teach, and, his, crew, worked, the, pirates, were, apparently, taken, aback, at, the, assault, teach, rallied, his, men, and, the, two, groups, fought, across, the, deck, which, was, already, slick, with, blood, from, those, killed, or, injured, by, teach, s, broadside, maynard, and, teach, fired, their, flintlocks, at, each, other, maynard, managed, to, hit, teach, while, teach, missed, both, then, threw, their, flintlocks, away, and, drew, their, cutlasses, teach, broke, maynard, s, cutlass, at, the, hilt, against, superior, training, and, a, slight, advantage, in, numbers, the, pirates, were, pushed, back, toward, the, bow, allowing, the, jane, s, crew, to, surround, maynard, and, teach, who, was, by, then, completely, isolated, teach, pressed, onward, and, was, about, to, deliver, a, killing, blow, but, was, slashed, across, the, neck, by, one, of, maynard, s, men, this, redirected, teach, s, cutlass, to, strike, maynard, s, knuckles, instead, of, killing, him, badly, wounded, teach, was, then, attacked, and, killed, by, several, more, of, maynard, s, crew, the, remaining, pirates, quickly, surrendered, those, left, on, the, adventure, were, captured, by, the, ranger, s, crew, including, one, who, planned, to, set, fire, to, the, powder, room, and, blow, up, the, ship, varying, accounts, exist, of, the, battle, s, list, of, casualties, maynard, reported, that, 8, of, his, men, and, 12, pirates, were, killed, brand, reported, that, 10, pirates, and, 11, of, maynard, s, men, were, killed, spotswood, claimed, ten, pirates, and, ten, of, the, king, s, men, dead, maynard, later, examined, teach, s, body, noting, that, it, had, been, shot, five, times, and, cut, about, twenty, he, also, found, several, items, of, correspondence, including, a, letter, from, tobias, knight, teach, s, corpse, was, thrown, into, the, inlet, and, his, head, was, suspended, from, the, bowsprit, of, maynard, s, sloop, so, that, the, reward, could, be, collected, on, their, return, to, virginia, teach, s, head, was, placed, on, a, pole, at, the, entrance, to, the, chesapeake, bay, as, a, warning, to, other, pirates, and, a, greeting, to, other, ships, and, it, stood, there, for, several, years, lieutenant, maynard, remained, at, ocracoke, for, several, more, days, making, repairs, and, burying, the, dead, teach, s, loot, sugar, cocoa, indigo, and, cotton, found, in, pirate, sloops, and, ashore, in, a, tent, where, the, sloops, lay, was, sold, at, auction, along, with, sugar, and, cotton, found, in, tobias, knight, s, barn, for, 2, 238, governor, spotswood, used, a, portion, of, this, to, pay, for, the, entire, operation, the, prize, money, for, capturing, teach, was, to, have, been, about, 400, 79, 000, in, 2024, but, it, was, split, between, the, crews, of, hms, lyme, and, hms, pearl, as, captain, brand, and, his, troops, had, not, been, the, ones, fighting, for, their, lives, maynard, thought, this, extremely, unfair, he, lost, much, of, any, support, he, might, have, had, though, when, it, was, discovered, that, he, and, his, crew, had, helped, themselves, to, about, 90, of, teach, s, booty, the, two, companies, did, not, receive, their, prize, money, for, another, four, years, and, despite, his, bravery, maynard, was, not, promoted, and, faded, into, obscurity, the, remainder, of, teach, s, crew, and, former, associates, were, found, by, brand, in, bath, and, were, transported, to, williamsburg, virginia, where, they, were, jailed, on, charges, of, piracy, several, were, black, prompting, spotswood, to, ask, his, council, what, could, be, done, about, the, circumstances, of, these, negroes, to, exempt, them, from, undergoing, the, same, tryal, as, other, pirates, regardless, the, men, were, tried, with, their, comrades, in, williamsburg, s, capitol, building, under, admiralty, law, on, 12, march, 1719, no, records, of, the, day, s, proceedings, remain, but, 14, of, the, 16, accused, were, found, guilty, of, the, remaining, two, one, proved, that, he, had, partaken, of, the, fight, out, of, necessity, having, been, on, teach, s, ship, only, as, a, guest, at, a, drinking, party, the, night, before, and, not, as, a, pirate, the, other, israel, hands, was, not, present, at, the, fight, he, claimed, that, during, a, drinking, session, teach, had, shot, him, in, the, knee, and, that, he, was, still, covered, by, the, royal, pardon, the, remaining, pirates, were, hanged, then, left, to, rot, in, gibbets, along, williamsburg, s, capitol, landing, road, known, for, some, time, after, as, gallows, road, governor, eden, was, certainly, embarrassed, by, spotswood, s, invasion, of, north, carolina, and, spotswood, disavowed, himself, of, any, part, of, the, seizure, he, defended, his, actions, writing, to, lord, carteret, a, shareholder, of, the, province, of, carolina, that, he, might, benefit, from, the, sale, of, the, seized, property, and, reminding, the, earl, of, the, number, of, virginians, who, had, died, to, protect, his, interests, he, argued, for, the, secrecy, of, the, operation, by, suggesting, that, eden, could, contribute, nothing, to, the, success, of, the, design, and, told, eden, that, his, authority, to, capture, the, pirates, came, from, the, king, eden, was, heavily, criticised, for, his, involvement, with, teach, and, was, accused, of, being, his, accomplice, by, criticising, eden, spotswood, intended, to, bolster, the, legitimacy, of, his, invasion, lee, 1974, concludes, that, although, spotswood, may, have, thought, that, the, ends, justified, the, means, he, had, no, legal, authority, to, invade, north, carolina, to, capture, the, pirates, and, to, seize, and, auction, their, goods, eden, doubtless, shared, the, same, view, as, spotswood, had, also, accused, tobias, knight, of, being, in, league, with, teach, on, 4, april, 1719, eden, had, knight, brought, in, for, questioning, israel, hands, had, weeks, earlier, testified, that, knight, had, been, on, board, the, adventure, in, august, 1718, shortly, after, teach, had, brought, a, french, ship, to, north, carolina, as, a, prize, four, pirates, had, testified, that, with, teach, they, had, visited, knight, s, home, to, give, him, presents, this, testimony, and, the, letter, found, on, teach, s, body, by, maynard, appeared, compelling, but, knight, conducted, his, defence, with, competence, despite, being, very, sick, and, close, to, death, he, questioned, the, reliability, of, spotswood, s, witnesses, he, claimed, that, israel, hands, had, talked, under, duress, and, that, under, north, carolinian, law, the, other, witness, an, african, was, unable, to, testify, the, sugar, he, argued, was, stored, at, his, house, legally, and, teach, had, visited, him, only, on, business, in, his, official, capacity, the, board, found, knight, innocent, of, all, charges, he, died, later, that, year, eden, was, annoyed, that, the, accusations, against, knight, arose, during, a, trial, in, which, he, played, no, part, the, goods, which, brand, seized, were, officially, north, carolinian, property, and, eden, considered, him, a, thief, the, argument, raged, back, and, forth, between, the, colonies, until, eden, s, death, on, 17, march, 1722, his, will, named, one, of, spotswood, s, opponents, john, holloway, a, beneficiary, in, the, same, year, spotswood, who, for, years, had, fought, his, enemies, in, the, house, of, burgesses, and, the, council, was, replaced, by, hugh, drysdale, once, robert, walpole, was, convinced, to, act, we, normally, think, about, pirates, as, sort, of, blood, lusting, that, they, want, to, slash, somebody, to, pieces, a, pirate, just, like, a, normal, person, would, probably, rather, not, have, killed, someone, but, pirates, knew, that, if, that, person, resisted, them, and, they, didn, t, do, something, about, it, their, reputation, and, thus, their, brand, name, would, be, impaired, so, you, can, imagine, a, pirate, rather, reluctantly, engaging, in, this, behavior, as, a, way, of, preserving, that, reputation, peter, leeson, official, views, on, pirates, were, sometimes, quite, different, from, those, held, by, contemporary, authors, who, often, described, their, subjects, as, despicable, rogues, of, the, sea, privateers, who, became, pirates, were, generally, considered, by, the, english, government, to, be, reserve, naval, forces, and, were, sometimes, given, active, encouragement, as, far, back, as, 1581, francis, drake, was, knighted, by, queen, elizabeth, when, he, returned, to, england, from, a, round, the, world, expedition, with, plunder, worth, an, estimated, 1, 500, 000, royal, pardons, were, regularly, issued, usually, when, england, was, on, the, verge, of, war, and, the, public, s, opinion, of, pirates, was, often, favourable, some, considering, them, akin, to, patrons, economist, peter, leeson, believes, that, pirates, were, generally, shrewd, businessmen, far, removed, from, the, modern, romanticised, view, of, them, as, barbarians, after, woodes, rogers, 1718, landing, at, new, providence, and, his, ending, of, the, pirate, republic, piracy, in, the, west, indies, fell, into, terminal, decline, with, no, easily, accessible, outlet, to, fence, their, stolen, goods, pirates, were, reduced, to, a, subsistence, livelihood, and, following, almost, a, century, of, naval, warfare, between, the, british, french, and, spanish, during, which, sailors, could, find, easy, employment, lone, privateers, found, themselves, outnumbered, by, the, powerful, ships, employed, by, the, british, empire, to, defend, its, merchant, fleets, the, popularity, of, the, slave, trade, helped, bring, to, an, end, the, frontier, condition, of, the, west, indies, and, in, these, circumstances, piracy, was, no, longer, able, to, flourish, as, it, once, did, since, the, end, of, the, golden, age, of, piracy, teach, and, his, exploits, have, become, the, stuff, of, lore, inspiring, books, films, and, even, amusement, park, rides, much, of, what, is, known, about, him, can, be, sourced, to, charles, johnson, s, a, general, historie, of, the, robberies, and, murders, of, the, most, notorious, pyrates, published, in, britain, in, 1724, a, recognised, authority, on, the, pirates, of, his, time, johnson, s, descriptions, of, such, figures, as, anne, bonny, and, mary, read, were, for, years, required, reading, for, those, interested, in, the, subject, readers, were, titillated, by, his, stories, and, a, second, edition, was, quickly, published, though, author, angus, konstam, suspects, that, johnson, s, entry, on, blackbeard, was, coloured, a, little, to, make, a, more, sensational, story, a, general, historie, though, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, reliable, source, johnson, may, have, been, an, assumed, alias, as, johnson, s, accounts, have, been, corroborated, in, personal, and, official, dispatches, lee, 1974, considers, that, whoever, he, was, he, had, some, access, to, official, correspondence, konstam, speculates, further, suggesting, that, johnson, may, have, been, the, english, playwright, charles, johnson, the, british, publisher, charles, rivington, or, the, writer, daniel, defoe, in, his, 1951, work, the, great, days, of, piracy, author, george, woodbury, wrote, that, johnson, is, obviously, a, pseudonym, continuing, one, cannot, help, suspecting, that, he, may, have, been, a, pirate, himself, despite, his, infamy, teach, was, not, the, most, successful, of, pirates, henry, every, retired, a, rich, man, and, bartholomew, roberts, took, an, estimated, five, times, the, amount, teach, stole, treasure, hunters, have, long, busied, themselves, searching, for, any, trace, of, his, rumoured, hoard, of, gold, and, silver, but, nothing, found, in, the, numerous, sites, explored, along, the, east, coast, of, the, us, has, ever, been, connected, to, him, some, tales, suggest, that, pirates, often, killed, a, prisoner, on, the, spot, where, they, buried, their, loot, and, teach, is, no, exception, in, these, stories, but, that, no, finds, have, come, to, light, is, not, exceptional, buried, pirate, treasure, is, often, considered, a, modern, myth, for, which, almost, no, supporting, evidence, exists, the, available, records, include, nothing, to, suggest, that, the, burial, of, treasure, was, a, common, practice, except, in, the, imaginations, of, the, writers, of, fictional, accounts, such, as, treasure, island, such, hoards, would, necessitate, a, wealthy, owner, and, their, supposed, existence, ignores, the, command, structure, of, a, pirate, vessel, in, which, the, crew, served, for, a, share, of, the, profit, the, only, pirate, ever, known, to, bury, treasure, was, william, kidd, the, only, treasure, so, far, recovered, from, teach, s, exploits, is, that, taken, from, the, wreckage, of, what, is, presumed, to, be, the, queen, anne, s, revenge, which, was, found, in, 1996, by, intersal, inc, a, private, research, firm, as, of, 2013, around, 280, 000, artefacts, had, been, recovered, from, the, wreck, site, a, selection, of, which, is, on, public, display, at, the, north, carolina, maritime, museum, various, superstitious, tales, exist, of, teach, s, ghost, unexplained, lights, at, sea, are, often, referred, to, as, teach, s, light, and, some, recitals, claim, that, the, notorious, pirate, now, roams, the, afterlife, searching, for, his, head, for, fear, that, his, friends, and, the, devil, will, not, recognise, him, a, north, carolinian, tale, holds, that, teach, s, skull, was, used, as, the, basis, for, a, silver, drinking, chalice, a, local, judge, even, claimed, to, have, drunk, from, it, one, night, in, the, 1930s, the, name, of, blackbeard, has, been, attached, to, many, local, attractions, such, as, charleston, s, blackbeard, s, cove, his, name, and, persona, have, also,
