john, von, neumann, v, n, n, m, n, von, noy, m, n, hungarian, neumann, j, nos, lajos, december, 28, 1903, february, 8, 1957, was, a, hungarian, and, american, mathematician, physicist, computer, scientist, and, engineer, he, had, perhaps, the, widest, coverage, of, any, mathematician, of, his, time, integrating, pure, and, applied, sciences, and, making, major, contributions, to, many, fields, including, mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and, statistics, he, was, a, pioneer, in, building, the, mathematical, framework, of, quantum, physics, in, the, development, of, functional, analysis, and, in, game, theory, introducing, or, codifying, concepts, including, cellular, automata, the, universal, constructor, and, the, digital, computer, his, analysis, of, the, structure, of, self, replication, preceded, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, during, world, war, ii, von, neumann, worked, on, the, manhattan, project, he, developed, the, mathematical, models, behind, the, explosive, lenses, used, in, the, implosion, type, nuclear, weapon, before, and, after, the, war, he, consulted, for, many, organizations, including, the, office, of, scientific, research, and, development, the, army, s, ballistic, research, laboratory, the, armed, forces, special, weapons, project, and, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, at, the, peak, of, his, influence, in, the, 1950s, he, chaired, a, number, of, defense, department, committees, including, the, strategic, missile, evaluation, committee, and, the, icbm, scientific, advisory, committee, he, was, also, a, member, of, the, influential, atomic, energy, commission, in, charge, of, all, atomic, energy, development, in, the, country, he, played, a, key, role, alongside, bernard, schriever, and, trevor, gardner, in, the, design, and, development, of, the, united, states, first, icbm, programs, at, that, time, he, was, considered, the, nation, s, foremost, expert, on, nuclear, weaponry, and, the, leading, defense, scientist, at, the, u, s, department, of, defense, von, neumann, s, contributions, and, intellectual, ability, drew, praise, from, colleagues, in, physics, mathematics, and, beyond, accolades, he, received, range, from, the, medal, of, freedom, to, a, crater, on, the, moon, named, in, his, honor, von, neumann, was, born, in, budapest, kingdom, of, hungary, then, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, on, december, 28, 1903, to, a, wealthy, non, observant, jewish, family, his, birth, name, was, neumann, j, nos, lajos, in, hungarian, the, family, name, comes, first, and, his, given, names, are, equivalent, to, john, louis, in, english, he, was, the, eldest, of, three, brothers, his, two, younger, siblings, were, mih, ly, michael, and, mikl, s, nicholas, his, father, neumann, miksa, max, von, neumann, was, a, banker, and, held, a, doctorate, in, law, he, had, moved, to, budapest, from, p, cs, at, the, end, of, the, 1880s, miksa, s, father, and, grandfather, were, born, in, ond, now, part, of, szerencs, zempl, n, county, northern, hungary, john, s, mother, was, kann, margit, margaret, kann, her, parents, were, kann, j, kab, and, meisels, katalin, of, the, meisels, family, three, generations, of, the, kann, family, lived, in, spacious, apartments, above, the, kann, heller, offices, in, budapest, von, neumann, s, family, occupied, an, 18, room, apartment, on, the, top, floor, on, february, 20, 1913, emperor, franz, joseph, elevated, john, s, father, to, the, hungarian, nobility, for, his, service, to, the, austro, hungarian, empire, the, neumann, family, thus, acquired, the, hereditary, appellation, margittai, meaning, of, margitta, today, marghita, romania, the, family, had, no, connection, with, the, town, the, appellation, was, chosen, in, reference, to, margaret, as, was, their, chosen, coat, of, arms, depicting, three, marguerites, neumann, j, nos, became, margittai, neumann, j, nos, john, neumann, de, margitta, which, he, later, changed, to, the, german, johann, von, neumann, von, neumann, was, a, child, prodigy, who, at, six, years, old, could, divide, two, eight, digit, numbers, in, his, head, and, converse, in, ancient, greek, he, his, brothers, and, his, cousins, were, instructed, by, governesses, von, neumann, s, father, believed, that, knowledge, of, languages, other, than, their, native, hungarian, was, essential, so, the, children, were, tutored, in, english, french, german, and, italian, by, age, eight, von, neumann, was, familiar, with, differential, and, integral, calculus, and, by, twelve, he, had, read, borel, s, la, th, orie, des, fonctions, he, was, also, interested, in, history, reading, wilhelm, oncken, s, 46, volume, world, history, series, allgemeine, geschichte, in, einzeldarstellungen, general, history, in, monographs, one, of, the, rooms, in, the, apartment, was, converted, into, a, library, and, reading, room, von, neumann, entered, the, lutheran, fasori, evang, likus, gimn, zium, in, 1914, eugene, wigner, was, a, year, ahead, of, von, neumann, at, the, school, and, soon, became, his, friend, although, von, neumann, s, father, insisted, that, he, attend, school, at, the, grade, level, appropriate, to, his, age, he, agreed, to, hire, private, tutors, to, give, von, neumann, advanced, instruction, at, 15, he, began, to, study, advanced, calculus, under, the, analyst, g, bor, szeg, by, 19, von, neumann, had, published, two, major, mathematical, papers, the, second, of, which, gave, the, modern, definition, of, ordinal, numbers, which, superseded, georg, cantor, s, definition, at, the, conclusion, of, his, education, at, the, gymnasium, he, applied, for, and, won, the, e, tv, s, prize, a, national, award, for, mathematics, according, to, his, friend, theodore, von, k, rm, n, von, neumann, s, father, wanted, john, to, follow, him, into, industry, and, asked, von, k, rm, n, to, persuade, his, son, not, to, take, mathematics, von, neumann, and, his, father, decided, that, the, best, career, path, was, chemical, engineering, this, was, not, something, that, von, neumann, had, much, knowledge, of, so, it, was, arranged, for, him, to, take, a, two, year, non, degree, course, in, chemistry, at, the, university, of, berlin, after, which, he, sat, for, the, entrance, exam, to, eth, zurich, which, he, passed, in, september, 1923, simultaneously, von, neumann, entered, p, zm, ny, p, ter, university, in, budapest, as, a, ph, d, candidate, in, mathematics, for, his, thesis, he, produced, an, axiomatization, of, cantor, s, set, theory, he, graduated, as, a, chemical, engineer, from, eth, zurich, in, 1926, and, simultaneously, passed, his, final, examinations, summa, cum, laude, for, his, ph, d, in, mathematics, with, minors, in, experimental, physics, and, chemistry, however, in, a, beautiful, mind, by, sylvia, nasar, it, s, stated, that, von, neumann, was, enrolled, in, chemical, engineering, at, the, university, of, budapest, while, studying, mathematics, in, berlin, he, then, went, to, the, university, of, g, ttingen, on, a, grant, from, the, rockefeller, foundation, to, study, mathematics, under, david, hilbert, hermann, weyl, remembers, how, in, the, winter, of, 1926, 1927, von, neumann, emmy, noether, and, he, would, walk, through, the, cold, wet, rain, wet, streets, of, g, ttingen, after, class, discussing, hypercomplex, number, systems, and, their, representations, von, neumann, s, habilitation, was, completed, on, december, 13, 1927, and, he, began, to, give, lectures, as, a, privatdozent, at, the, university, of, berlin, in, 1928, he, was, the, youngest, person, elected, privatdozent, in, the, university, s, history, he, began, writing, nearly, one, major, mathematics, paper, per, month, in, 1929, he, briefly, became, a, privatdozent, at, the, university, of, hamburg, where, the, prospects, of, becoming, a, tenured, professor, were, better, then, in, october, of, that, year, moved, to, princeton, university, as, a, visiting, lecturer, in, mathematical, physics, von, neumann, was, baptized, a, catholic, in, 1930, shortly, afterward, he, married, marietta, k, vesi, who, had, studied, economics, at, budapest, university, von, neumann, and, marietta, had, a, daughter, marina, born, in, 1935, she, would, become, a, professor, the, couple, divorced, on, november, 2, 1937, on, november, 17, 1938, von, neumann, married, kl, ra, d, n, in, 1933, von, neumann, accepted, a, tenured, professorship, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, new, jersey, when, that, institution, s, plan, to, appoint, hermann, weyl, appeared, to, have, failed, his, mother, brothers, and, in, laws, followed, von, neumann, to, the, united, states, in, 1939, von, neumann, anglicized, his, name, to, john, keeping, the, german, aristocratic, surname, von, neumann, von, neumann, became, a, naturalized, u, s, citizen, in, 1937, and, immediately, tried, to, become, a, lieutenant, in, the, u, s, army, s, officers, reserve, corps, he, passed, the, exams, but, was, rejected, because, of, his, age, kl, ra, and, john, von, neumann, were, socially, active, within, the, local, academic, community, his, white, clapboard, house, on, westcott, road, was, one, of, princeton, s, largest, private, residences, he, always, wore, formal, suits, he, enjoyed, yiddish, and, off, color, humor, in, princeton, he, received, complaints, for, playing, extremely, loud, german, march, music, von, neumann, did, some, of, his, best, work, in, noisy, chaotic, environments, according, to, churchill, eisenhart, von, neumann, could, attend, parties, until, the, early, hours, of, the, morning, and, then, deliver, a, lecture, at, 8, 30, he, was, known, for, always, being, happy, to, provide, others, of, all, ability, levels, with, scientific, and, mathematical, advice, wigner, wrote, that, he, perhaps, supervised, more, work, in, a, casual, sense, than, any, other, modern, mathematician, his, daughter, wrote, that, he, was, very, concerned, with, his, legacy, in, two, aspects, her, life, and, the, durability, of, his, intellectual, contributions, to, the, world, many, considered, him, an, excellent, chairman, of, committees, deferring, rather, easily, on, personal, or, organizational, matters, but, pressing, on, technical, ones, herbert, york, described, the, many, von, neumann, committees, that, he, participated, in, as, remarkable, in, style, as, well, as, output, the, way, the, committees, von, neumann, chaired, worked, directly, and, intimately, with, the, necessary, military, or, corporate, entities, became, a, blueprint, for, all, air, force, long, range, missile, programs, many, people, who, had, known, von, neumann, were, puzzled, by, his, relationship, to, the, military, and, to, power, structures, in, general, stanis, aw, ulam, suspected, that, he, had, a, hidden, admiration, for, people, or, organizations, that, could, influence, the, thoughts, and, decision, making, of, others, he, also, maintained, his, knowledge, of, languages, learnt, in, his, youth, he, knew, hungarian, french, german, and, english, fluently, and, maintained, a, conversational, level, of, italian, yiddish, latin, and, ancient, greek, his, spanish, was, less, perfect, he, had, a, passion, for, and, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, ancient, history, and, he, enjoyed, reading, ancient, greek, historians, in, the, original, greek, ulam, suspected, they, may, have, shaped, his, views, on, how, future, events, could, play, out, and, how, human, nature, and, society, worked, in, general, von, neumann, s, closest, friend, in, the, united, states, was, the, mathematician, stanis, aw, ulam, von, neumann, believed, that, much, of, his, mathematical, thought, occurred, intuitively, he, would, often, go, to, sleep, with, a, problem, unsolved, and, know, the, answer, upon, waking, up, ulam, noted, that, von, neumann, s, way, of, thinking, might, not, be, visual, but, more, aural, ulam, recalled, quite, independently, of, his, liking, for, abstract, wit, he, had, a, strong, appreciation, one, might, say, almost, a, hunger, for, the, more, earthy, type, of, comedy, and, humor, in, 1955, a, mass, was, found, near, von, neumann, s, collarbone, which, turned, out, to, be, cancer, originating, in, the, skeleton, pancreas, or, prostate, while, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, tumor, had, metastasised, sources, differ, on, the, location, of, the, primary, cancer, the, malignancy, may, have, been, caused, by, exposure, to, radiation, at, los, alamos, national, laboratory, father, strittmatter, recalled, that, even, after, receiving, the, last, rites, von, neumann, did, not, receive, much, peace, or, comfort, from, it, as, he, remained, terrified, of, death, and, unable, to, accept, his, circumstances, of, his, religious, views, von, neumann, reportedly, said, so, long, as, there, is, the, possibility, of, eternal, damnation, for, nonbelievers, it, is, more, logical, to, be, a, believer, at, the, end, referring, to, pascal, s, wager, he, confided, to, his, mother, there, probably, has, to, be, a, god, many, things, are, easier, to, explain, if, there, is, than, if, there, isn, t, he, died, on, february, 8, 1957, at, walter, reed, army, medical, hospital, and, was, buried, at, princeton, cemetery, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, efforts, to, base, mathematics, on, naive, set, theory, suffered, a, setback, due, to, russell, s, paradox, on, the, set, of, all, sets, that, do, not, belong, to, themselves, the, problem, of, an, adequate, axiomatization, of, set, theory, was, resolved, implicitly, about, twenty, years, later, by, ernst, zermelo, and, abraham, fraenkel, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, provided, a, series, of, principles, that, allowed, for, the, construction, of, the, sets, used, in, the, everyday, practice, of, mathematics, but, did, not, explicitly, exclude, the, possibility, of, the, existence, of, a, set, that, belongs, to, itself, in, his, 1925, doctoral, thesis, von, neumann, demonstrated, two, techniques, to, exclude, such, sets, the, axiom, of, foundation, and, the, notion, of, class, the, axiom, of, foundation, proposed, that, every, set, can, be, constructed, from, the, bottom, up, in, an, ordered, succession, of, steps, by, way, of, the, zermelo, fraenkel, principles, if, one, set, belongs, to, another, then, the, first, must, necessarily, come, before, the, second, in, the, succession, this, excludes, the, possibility, of, a, set, belonging, to, itself, to, demonstrate, that, the, addition, of, this, new, axiom, to, the, others, did, not, produce, contradictions, von, neumann, introduced, the, method, of, inner, models, which, became, an, essential, demonstration, instrument, in, set, theory, the, second, approach, to, the, problem, of, sets, belonging, to, themselves, took, as, its, base, the, notion, of, class, and, defines, a, set, as, a, class, that, belongs, to, other, classes, while, a, proper, class, is, defined, as, a, class, that, does, not, belong, to, other, classes, on, the, zermelo, fraenkel, approach, the, axioms, impede, the, construction, of, a, set, of, all, sets, that, do, not, belong, to, themselves, in, contrast, on, von, neumann, s, approach, the, class, of, all, sets, that, do, not, belong, to, themselves, can, be, constructed, but, it, is, a, proper, class, not, a, set, overall, von, neumann, s, major, achievement, in, set, theory, was, an, axiomatization, of, set, theory, and, connected, with, that, elegant, theory, of, the, ordinal, and, cardinal, numbers, as, well, as, the, first, strict, formulation, of, principles, of, definitions, by, the, transfinite, induction, building, on, the, hausdorff, paradox, of, felix, hausdorff, 1914, stefan, banach, and, alfred, tarski, in, 1924, showed, how, to, subdivide, a, three, dimensional, ball, into, disjoint, sets, then, translate, and, rotate, these, sets, to, form, two, identical, copies, of, the, same, ball, this, is, the, banach, tarski, paradox, they, also, proved, that, a, two, dimensional, disk, has, no, such, paradoxical, decomposition, but, in, 1929, von, neumann, subdivided, the, disk, into, finitely, many, pieces, and, rearranged, them, into, two, disks, using, area, preserving, affine, transformations, instead, of, translations, and, rotations, the, result, depended, on, finding, free, groups, of, affine, transformations, an, important, technique, extended, later, by, von, neumann, in, his, work, on, measure, theory, with, the, contributions, of, von, neumann, to, sets, the, axiomatic, system, of, the, theory, of, sets, avoided, the, contradictions, of, earlier, systems, and, became, usable, as, a, foundation, for, mathematics, despite, the, lack, of, a, proof, of, its, consistency, the, next, question, was, whether, it, provided, definitive, answers, to, all, mathematical, questions, that, could, be, posed, in, it, or, whether, it, might, be, improved, by, adding, stronger, axioms, that, could, be, used, to, prove, a, broader, class, of, theorems, by, 1927, von, neumann, was, involving, himself, in, discussions, in, g, ttingen, on, whether, elementary, arithmetic, followed, from, peano, axioms, building, on, the, work, of, ackermann, he, began, attempting, to, prove, using, the, finistic, methods, of, hilbert, s, school, the, consistency, of, first, order, arithmetic, he, succeeded, in, proving, the, consistency, of, a, fragment, of, arithmetic, of, natural, numbers, through, the, use, of, restrictions, on, induction, he, continued, looking, for, a, more, general, proof, of, the, consistency, of, classical, mathematics, using, methods, from, proof, theory, a, strongly, negative, answer, to, whether, it, was, definitive, arrived, in, september, 1930, at, the, second, conference, on, the, epistemology, of, the, exact, sciences, in, which, kurt, g, del, announced, his, first, theorem, of, incompleteness, the, usual, axiomatic, systems, are, incomplete, in, the, sense, that, they, cannot, prove, every, truth, expressible, in, their, language, moreover, every, consistent, extension, of, these, systems, necessarily, remains, incomplete, at, the, conference, von, neumann, suggested, to, g, del, that, he, should, try, to, transform, his, results, for, undecidable, propositions, about, integers, less, than, a, month, later, von, neumann, communicated, to, g, del, an, interesting, consequence, of, his, theorem, the, usual, axiomatic, systems, are, unable, to, demonstrate, their, own, consistency, g, del, replied, that, he, had, already, discovered, this, consequence, now, known, as, his, second, incompleteness, theorem, and, that, he, would, send, a, preprint, of, his, article, containing, both, results, which, never, appeared, von, neumann, acknowledged, g, del, s, priority, in, his, next, letter, however, von, neumann, s, method, of, proof, differed, from, g, del, s, and, he, was, also, of, the, opinion, that, the, second, incompleteness, theorem, had, dealt, a, much, stronger, blow, to, hilbert, s, program, than, g, del, thought, it, did, with, this, discovery, which, drastically, changed, his, views, on, mathematical, rigor, von, neumann, ceased, research, in, the, foundations, of, mathematics, and, metamathematics, and, instead, spent, time, on, problems, connected, with, applications, in, a, series, of, papers, published, in, 1932, von, neumann, made, foundational, contributions, to, ergodic, theory, a, branch, of, mathematics, that, involves, the, states, of, dynamical, systems, with, an, invariant, measure, of, the, 1932, papers, on, ergodic, theory, paul, halmos, wrote, that, even, if, von, neumann, had, never, done, anything, else, they, would, have, been, sufficient, to, guarantee, him, mathematical, immortality, by, then, von, neumann, had, already, written, his, articles, on, operator, theory, and, the, application, of, this, work, was, instrumental, in, his, mean, ergodic, theorem, the, theorem, is, about, arbitrary, one, parameter, unitary, groups, t, v, t, displaystyle, mathit, t, to, mathit, v, t, and, states, that, for, every, vector, displaystyle, phi, in, the, hilbert, space, lim, t, 1, t, 0, t, v, t, d, t, textstyle, lim, t, to, infty, frac, 1, t, int, 0, t, v, t, phi, dt, exists, in, the, sense, of, the, metric, defined, by, the, hilbert, norm, and, is, a, vector, displaystyle, psi, which, is, such, that, v, t, displaystyle, v, t, psi, psi, for, all, t, displaystyle, t, this, was, proven, in, the, first, paper, in, the, second, paper, von, neumann, argued, that, his, results, here, were, sufficient, for, physical, applications, relating, to, boltzmann, s, ergodic, hypothesis, he, also, pointed, out, that, ergodicity, had, not, yet, been, achieved, and, isolated, this, for, future, work, later, in, the, year, he, published, another, influential, paper, that, began, the, systematic, study, of, ergodicity, he, gave, and, proved, a, decomposition, theorem, showing, that, the, ergodic, measure, preserving, actions, of, the, real, line, are, the, fundamental, building, blocks, from, which, all, measure, preserving, actions, can, be, built, several, other, key, theorems, are, given, and, proven, the, results, in, this, paper, and, another, in, conjunction, with, paul, halmos, have, significant, applications, in, other, areas, of, mathematics, in, measure, theory, the, problem, of, measure, for, an, n, dimensional, euclidean, space, r, n, may, be, stated, as, does, there, exist, a, positive, normalized, invariant, and, additive, set, function, on, the, class, of, all, subsets, of, r, n, the, work, of, felix, hausdorff, and, stefan, banach, had, implied, that, the, problem, of, measure, has, a, positive, solution, if, n, 1, or, n, 2, and, a, negative, solution, because, of, the, banach, tarski, paradox, in, all, other, cases, von, neumann, s, work, argued, that, the, problem, is, essentially, group, theoretic, in, character, the, existence, of, a, measure, could, be, determined, by, looking, at, the, properties, of, the, transformation, group, of, the, given, space, the, positive, solution, for, spaces, of, dimension, at, most, two, and, the, negative, solution, for, higher, dimensions, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, euclidean, group, is, a, solvable, group, for, dimension, at, most, two, and, is, not, solvable, for, higher, dimensions, thus, according, to, von, neumann, it, is, the, change, of, group, that, makes, a, difference, not, the, change, of, space, around, 1942, he, told, dorothy, maharam, how, to, prove, that, every, complete, finite, measure, space, has, a, multiplicative, lifting, he, did, not, publish, this, proof, and, she, later, came, up, with, a, new, one, in, a, number, of, von, neumann, s, papers, the, methods, of, argument, he, employed, are, considered, even, more, significant, than, the, results, in, anticipation, of, his, later, study, of, dimension, theory, in, algebras, of, operators, von, neumann, used, results, on, equivalence, by, finite, decomposition, and, reformulated, the, problem, of, measure, in, terms, of, functions, a, major, contribution, von, neumann, made, to, measure, theory, was, the, result, of, a, paper, written, to, answer, a, question, of, haar, regarding, whether, there, existed, an, algebra, of, all, bounded, functions, on, the, real, number, line, such, that, they, form, a, complete, system, of, representatives, of, the, classes, of, almost, everywhere, equal, measurable, bounded, functions, he, proved, this, in, the, positive, and, in, later, papers, with, stone, discussed, various, generalizations, and, algebraic, aspects, of, this, problem, he, also, proved, by, new, methods, the, existence, of, disintegrations, for, various, general, types, of, measures, von, neumann, also, gave, a, new, proof, on, the, uniqueness, of, haar, measures, by, using, the, mean, values, of, functions, although, this, method, only, worked, for, compact, groups, he, had, to, create, entirely, new, techniques, to, apply, this, to, locally, compact, groups, he, also, gave, a, new, ingenious, proof, for, the, radon, nikodym, theorem, his, lecture, notes, on, measure, theory, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, were, an, important, source, for, knowledge, on, the, topic, in, america, at, the, time, and, were, later, published, using, his, previous, work, on, measure, theory, von, neumann, made, several, contributions, to, the, theory, of, topological, groups, beginning, with, a, paper, on, almost, periodic, functions, on, groups, where, von, neumann, extended, bohr, s, theory, of, almost, periodic, functions, to, arbitrary, groups, he, continued, this, work, with, another, paper, in, conjunction, with, bochner, that, improved, the, theory, of, almost, periodicity, to, include, functions, that, took, on, elements, of, linear, spaces, as, values, rather, than, numbers, in, 1938, he, was, awarded, the, b, cher, memorial, prize, for, his, work, in, analysis, in, relation, to, these, papers, in, a, 1933, paper, he, used, the, newly, discovered, haar, measure, in, the, solution, of, hilbert, s, fifth, problem, for, the, case, of, compact, groups, the, basic, idea, behind, this, was, discovered, several, years, earlier, when, von, neumann, published, a, paper, on, the, analytic, properties, of, groups, of, linear, transformations, and, found, that, closed, subgroups, of, a, general, linear, group, are, lie, groups, this, was, later, extended, by, cartan, to, arbitrary, lie, groups, in, the, form, of, the, closed, subgroup, theorem, von, neumann, was, the, first, to, axiomatically, define, an, abstract, hilbert, space, he, defined, it, as, a, complex, vector, space, with, a, hermitian, scalar, product, with, the, corresponding, norm, being, both, separable, and, complete, in, the, same, papers, he, also, proved, the, general, form, of, the, cauchy, schwarz, inequality, that, had, previously, been, known, only, in, specific, examples, he, continued, with, the, development, of, the, spectral, theory, of, operators, in, hilbert, space, in, three, seminal, papers, between, 1929, and, 1932, this, work, cumulated, in, his, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, which, alongside, two, other, books, by, stone, and, banach, in, the, same, year, were, the, first, monographs, on, hilbert, space, theory, previous, work, by, others, showed, that, a, theory, of, weak, topologies, could, not, be, obtained, by, using, sequences, von, neumann, was, the, first, to, outline, a, program, of, how, to, overcome, the, difficulties, which, resulted, in, him, defining, locally, convex, spaces, and, topological, vector, spaces, for, the, first, time, in, addition, several, other, topological, properties, he, defined, at, the, time, he, was, among, the, first, mathematicians, to, apply, new, topological, ideas, from, hausdorff, from, euclidean, to, hilbert, spaces, such, as, boundness, and, total, boundness, are, still, used, today, for, twenty, years, von, neumann, was, considered, the, undisputed, master, of, this, area, these, developments, were, primarily, prompted, by, needs, in, quantum, mechanics, where, von, neumann, realized, the, need, to, extend, the, spectral, theory, of, hermitian, operators, from, the, bounded, to, the, unbounded, case, other, major, achievements, in, these, papers, include, a, complete, elucidation, of, spectral, theory, for, normal, operators, the, first, abstract, presentation, of, the, trace, of, a, positive, operator, a, generalisation, of, riesz, s, presentation, of, hilbert, s, spectral, theorems, at, the, time, and, the, discovery, of, hermitian, operators, in, a, hilbert, space, as, distinct, from, self, adjoint, operators, which, enabled, him, to, give, a, description, of, all, hermitian, operators, which, extend, a, given, hermitian, operator, he, wrote, a, paper, detailing, how, the, usage, of, infinite, matrices, common, at, the, time, in, spectral, theory, was, inadequate, as, a, representation, for, hermitian, operators, his, work, on, operator, theory, lead, to, his, most, profound, invention, in, pure, mathematics, the, study, of, von, neumann, algebras, and, in, general, of, operator, algebras, his, later, work, on, rings, of, operators, lead, to, him, revisiting, his, work, on, spectral, theory, and, providing, a, new, way, of, working, through, the, geometric, content, by, the, use, of, direct, integrals, of, hilbert, spaces, like, in, his, work, on, measure, theory, he, proved, several, theorems, that, he, did, not, find, time, to, publish, he, told, nachman, aronszajn, and, k, t, smith, that, in, the, early, 1930s, he, proved, the, existence, of, proper, invariant, subspaces, for, completely, continuous, operators, in, a, hilbert, space, while, working, on, the, invariant, subspace, problem, with, i, j, schoenberg, he, wrote, several, items, investigating, translation, invariant, hilbertian, metrics, on, the, real, number, line, which, resulted, in, their, complete, classification, their, motivation, lie, in, various, questions, related, to, embedding, metric, spaces, into, hilbert, spaces, with, pascual, jordan, he, wrote, a, short, paper, giving, the, first, derivation, of, a, given, norm, from, an, inner, product, by, means, of, the, parallelogram, identity, his, trace, inequality, is, a, key, result, of, matrix, theory, used, in, matrix, approximation, problems, he, also, first, presented, the, idea, that, the, dual, of, a, pre, norm, is, a, norm, in, the, first, major, paper, discussing, the, theory, of, unitarily, invariant, norms, and, symmetric, gauge, functions, now, known, as, symmetric, absolute, norms, this, paper, leads, naturally, to, the, study, of, symmetric, operator, ideals, and, is, the, beginning, point, for, modern, studies, of, symmetric, operator, spaces, later, with, robert, schatten, he, initiated, the, study, of, nuclear, operators, on, hilbert, spaces, tensor, products, of, banach, spaces, introduced, and, studied, trace, class, operators, their, ideals, and, their, duality, with, compact, operators, and, preduality, with, bounded, operators, the, generalization, of, this, topic, to, the, study, of, nuclear, operators, on, banach, spaces, was, among, the, first, achievements, of, alexander, grothendieck, previously, in, 1937, von, neumann, published, several, results, in, this, area, for, example, giving, 1, parameter, scale, of, different, cross, norms, on, l, 2, n, l, 2, n, displaystyle, textit, l, 2, n, otimes, textit, l, 2, n, and, proving, several, other, results, on, what, are, now, known, as, schatten, von, neumann, ideals, von, neumann, founded, the, study, of, rings, of, operators, through, the, von, neumann, algebras, originally, called, w, algebras, while, his, original, ideas, for, rings, of, operators, existed, already, in, 1930, he, did, not, begin, studying, them, in, depth, until, he, met, f, j, murray, several, years, later, a, von, neumann, algebra, is, a, algebra, of, bounded, operators, on, a, hilbert, space, that, is, closed, in, the, weak, operator, topology, and, contains, the, identity, operator, the, von, neumann, bicommutant, theorem, shows, that, the, analytic, definition, is, equivalent, to, a, purely, algebraic, definition, as, being, equal, to, the, bicommutant, after, elucidating, the, study, of, the, commutative, algebra, case, von, neumann, embarked, in, 1936, with, the, partial, collaboration, of, murray, on, the, noncommutative, case, the, general, study, of, factors, classification, of, von, neumann, algebras, the, six, major, papers, in, which, he, developed, that, theory, between, 1936, and, 1940, rank, among, the, masterpieces, of, analysis, in, the, twentieth, century, they, collect, many, foundational, results, and, started, several, programs, in, operator, algebra, theory, that, mathematicians, worked, on, for, decades, afterwards, an, example, is, the, classification, of, factors, in, addition, in, 1938, he, proved, that, every, von, neumann, algebra, on, a, separable, hilbert, space, is, a, direct, integral, of, factors, he, did, not, find, time, to, publish, this, result, until, 1949, von, neumann, algebras, relate, closely, to, a, theory, of, noncommutative, integration, something, that, von, neumann, hinted, to, in, his, work, but, did, not, explicitly, write, out, another, important, result, on, polar, decomposition, was, published, in, 1932, between, 1935, and, 1937, von, neumann, worked, on, lattice, theory, the, theory, of, partially, ordered, sets, in, which, every, two, elements, have, a, greatest, lower, bound, and, a, least, upper, bound, as, garrett, birkhoff, wrote, john, von, neumann, s, brilliant, mind, blazed, over, lattice, theory, like, a, meteor, von, neumann, combined, traditional, projective, geometry, with, modern, algebra, linear, algebra, ring, theory, lattice, theory, many, previously, geometric, results, could, then, be, interpreted, in, the, case, of, general, modules, over, rings, his, work, laid, the, foundations, for, some, of, the, modern, work, in, projective, geometry, his, biggest, contribution, was, founding, the, field, of, continuous, geometry, it, followed, his, path, breaking, work, on, rings, of, operators, in, mathematics, continuous, geometry, is, a, substitute, of, complex, projective, geometry, where, instead, of, the, dimension, of, a, subspace, being, in, a, discrete, set, 0, 1, n, displaystyle, 0, 1, mathit, n, it, can, be, an, element, of, the, unit, interval, 0, 1, displaystyle, earlier, menger, and, birkhoff, had, axiomatized, complex, projective, geometry, in, terms, of, the, properties, of, its, lattice, of, linear, subspaces, von, neumann, following, his, work, on, rings, of, operators, weakened, those, axioms, to, describe, a, broader, class, of, lattices, the, continuous, geometries, while, the, dimensions, of, the, subspaces, of, projective, geometries, are, a, discrete, set, the, non, negative, integers, the, dimensions, of, the, elements, of, a, continuous, geometry, can, range, continuously, across, the, unit, interval, 0, 1, displaystyle, von, neumann, was, motivated, by, his, discovery, of, von, neumann, algebras, with, a, dimension, function, taking, a, continuous, range, of, dimensions, and, the, first, example, of, a, continuous, geometry, other, than, projective, space, was, the, projections, of, the, hyperfinite, type, ii, factor, in, more, pure, lattice, theoretical, work, he, solved, the, difficult, problem, of, characterizing, the, class, of, c, g, f, displaystyle, mathit, cg, f, continuous, dimensional, projective, geometry, over, an, arbitrary, division, ring, f, displaystyle, mathit, f, in, abstract, language, of, lattice, theory, von, neumann, provided, an, abstract, exploration, of, dimension, in, completed, complemented, modular, topological, lattices, properties, that, arise, in, the, lattices, of, subspaces, of, inner, product, spaces, dimension, is, determined, up, to, a, positive, linear, transformation, by, the, following, two, properties, it, is, conserved, by, perspective, mappings, perspectivities, and, ordered, by, inclusion, the, deepest, part, of, the, proof, concerns, the, equivalence, of, perspectivity, with, projectivity, by, decomposition, of, which, a, corollary, is, the, transitivity, of, perspectivity, for, any, integer, n, 3, displaystyle, n, 3, every, n, displaystyle, mathit, n, dimensional, abstract, projective, geometry, is, isomorphic, to, the, subspace, lattice, of, an, n, displaystyle, mathit, n, dimensional, vector, space, v, n, f, displaystyle, v, n, f, over, a, unique, corresponding, division, ring, f, displaystyle, f, this, is, known, as, the, veblen, young, theorem, von, neumann, extended, this, fundamental, result, in, projective, geometry, to, the, continuous, dimensional, case, this, coordinatization, theorem, stimulated, considerable, work, in, abstract, projective, geometry, and, lattice, theory, much, of, which, continued, using, von, neumann, s, techniques, birkhoff, described, this, theorem, as, follows, any, complemented, modular, lattice, l, having, a, basis, of, n, 4, pairwise, perspective, elements, is, isomorphic, with, the, lattice, r, of, all, principal, right, ideals, of, a, suitable, regular, ring, r, this, conclusion, is, the, culmination, of, 140, pages, of, brilliant, and, incisive, algebra, involving, entirely, novel, axioms, anyone, wishing, to, get, an, unforgettable, impression, of, the, razor, edge, of, von, neumann, s, mind, need, merely, try, to, pursue, this, chain, of, exact, reasoning, for, himself, realizing, that, often, five, pages, of, it, were, written, down, before, breakfast, seated, at, a, living, room, writing, table, in, a, bathrobe, this, work, required, the, creation, of, regular, rings, a, von, neumann, regular, ring, is, a, ring, where, for, every, a, displaystyle, a, an, element, x, displaystyle, x, exists, such, that, a, x, a, a, displaystyle, axa, a, these, rings, came, from, and, have, connections, to, his, work, on, von, neumann, algebras, as, well, as, aw, algebras, and, various, kinds, of, c, algebras, many, smaller, technical, results, were, proven, during, the, creation, and, proof, of, the, above, theorems, particularly, regarding, distributivity, such, as, infinite, distributivity, von, neumann, developing, them, as, needed, he, also, developed, a, theory, of, valuations, in, lattices, and, shared, in, developing, the, general, theory, of, metric, lattices, birkhoff, noted, in, his, posthumous, article, on, von, neumann, that, most, of, these, results, were, developed, in, an, intense, two, year, period, of, work, and, that, while, his, interests, continued, in, lattice, theory, after, 1937, they, became, peripheral, and, mainly, occurred, in, letters, to, other, mathematicians, a, final, contribution, in, 1940, was, for, a, joint, seminar, he, conducted, with, birkhoff, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, on, the, subject, where, he, developed, a, theory, of, complete, lattice, ordered, rings, he, never, wrote, up, the, work, for, publication, von, neumann, made, fundamental, contributions, to, mathematical, statistics, in, 1941, he, derived, the, exact, distribution, of, the, ratio, of, the, mean, square, of, successive, differences, to, the, sample, variance, for, independent, and, identically, normally, distributed, variables, this, ratio, was, applied, to, the, residuals, from, regression, models, and, is, commonly, known, as, the, durbin, watson, statistic, for, testing, the, null, hypothesis, that, the, errors, are, serially, independent, against, the, alternative, that, they, follow, a, stationary, first, order, autoregression, subsequently, denis, sargan, and, alok, bhargava, extended, the, results, for, testing, whether, the, errors, on, a, regression, model, follow, a, gaussian, random, walk, i, e, possess, a, unit, root, against, the, alternative, that, they, are, a, stationary, first, order, autoregression, in, his, early, years, von, neumann, published, several, papers, related, to, set, theoretical, real, analysis, and, number, theory, in, a, paper, from, 1925, he, proved, that, for, any, dense, sequence, of, points, in, 0, 1, displaystyle, there, existed, a, rearrangement, of, those, points, that, is, uniformly, distributed, in, 1926, his, sole, publication, was, on, pr, fer, s, theory, of, ideal, algebraic, numbers, where, he, found, a, new, way, of, constructing, them, thus, extending, pr, fer, s, theory, to, the, field, of, all, algebraic, numbers, and, clarified, their, relation, to, p, adic, numbers, in, 1928, he, published, two, additional, papers, continuing, with, these, themes, the, first, dealt, with, partitioning, an, interval, into, countably, many, congruent, subsets, it, solved, a, problem, of, hugo, steinhaus, asking, whether, an, interval, is, 0, displaystyle, aleph, 0, divisible, von, neumann, proved, that, indeed, that, all, intervals, half, open, open, or, closed, are, 0, displaystyle, aleph, 0, divisible, by, translations, i, e, that, these, intervals, can, be, decomposed, into, 0, displaystyle, aleph, 0, subsets, that, are, congruent, by, translation, his, next, paper, dealt, with, giving, a, constructive, proof, without, the, axiom, of, choice, that, 2, 0, displaystyle, 2, aleph, 0, algebraically, independent, reals, exist, he, proved, that, a, r, n, 0, 2, 2, n, r, 2, 2, n, 2, displaystyle, a, r, textstyle, sum, n, 0, infty, 2, 2, big, 2, 2, n, 2, are, algebraically, independent, for, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, consequently, there, exists, a, perfect, algebraically, independent, set, of, reals, the, size, of, the, continuum, other, minor, results, from, his, early, career, include, a, proof, of, a, maximum, principle, for, the, gradient, of, a, minimizing, function, in, the, field, of, calculus, of, variations, and, a, small, simplification, of, hermann, minkowski, s, theorem, for, linear, forms, in, geometric, number, theory, later, in, his, career, together, with, pascual, jordan, and, eugene, wigner, he, wrote, a, foundational, paper, classifying, all, finite, dimensional, formally, real, jordan, algebras, and, discovering, the, albert, algebras, while, attempting, to, look, for, a, better, mathematical, formalism, for, quantum, theory, in, 1936, he, attempted, to, further, the, program, of, replacing, the, axioms, of, his, previous, hilbert, space, program, with, those, of, jordan, algebras, in, a, paper, investigating, the, infinite, dimensional, case, he, planned, to, write, at, least, one, further, paper, on, the, topic, but, never, did, nevertheless, these, axioms, formed, the, basis, for, further, investigations, of, algebraic, quantum, mechanics, started, by, irving, segal, von, neumann, was, the, first, to, establish, a, rigorous, mathematical, framework, for, quantum, mechanics, known, as, the, dirac, von, neumann, axioms, in, his, influential, 1932, work, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, after, having, completed, the, axiomatization, of, set, theory, he, began, to, confront, the, axiomatization, of, quantum, mechanics, he, realized, in, 1926, that, a, state, of, a, quantum, system, could, be, represented, by, a, point, in, a, complex, hilbert, space, that, in, general, could, be, infinite, dimensional, even, for, a, single, particle, in, this, formalism, of, quantum, mechanics, observable, quantities, such, as, position, or, momentum, are, represented, as, linear, operators, acting, on, the, hilbert, space, associated, with, the, quantum, system, the, physics, of, quantum, mechanics, was, thereby, reduced, to, the, mathematics, of, hilbert, spaces, and, linear, operators, acting, on, them, for, example, the, uncertainty, principle, according, to, which, the, determination, of, the, position, of, a, particle, prevents, the, determination, of, its, momentum, and, vice, versa, is, translated, into, the, non, commutativity, of, the, two, corresponding, operators, this, new, mathematical, formulation, included, as, special, cases, the, formulations, of, both, heisenberg, and, schr, dinger, von, neumann, s, abstract, treatment, permitted, him, to, confront, the, foundational, issue, of, determinism, versus, non, determinism, and, in, the, book, he, presented, a, proof, that, the, statistical, results, of, quantum, mechanics, could, not, possibly, be, averages, of, an, underlying, set, of, determined, hidden, variables, as, in, classical, statistical, mechanics, in, 1935, grete, hermann, published, a, paper, arguing, that, the, proof, contained, a, conceptual, error, and, was, therefore, invalid, hermann, s, work, was, largely, ignored, until, after, john, s, bell, made, essentially, the, same, argument, in, 1966, in, 2010, jeffrey, bub, argued, that, bell, had, misconstrued, von, neumann, s, proof, and, pointed, out, that, the, proof, though, not, valid, for, all, hidden, variable, theories, does, rule, out, a, well, defined, and, important, subset, bub, also, suggests, that, von, neumann, was, aware, of, this, limitation, and, did, not, claim, that, his, proof, completely, ruled, out, hidden, variable, theories, the, validity, of, bub, s, argument, is, in, turn, disputed, gleason, s, theorem, of, 1957, provided, an, argument, against, hidden, variables, along, the, lines, of, von, neumann, s, but, founded, on, assumptions, seen, as, better, motivated, and, more, physically, meaningful, von, neumann, s, proof, inaugurated, a, line, of, research, that, ultimately, led, through, bell, s, theorem, and, the, experiments, of, alain, aspect, in, 1982, to, the, demonstration, that, quantum, physics, either, requires, a, notion, of, reality, substantially, different, from, that, of, classical, physics, or, must, include, nonlocality, in, apparent, violation, of, special, relativity, in, a, chapter, of, the, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, von, neumann, deeply, analyzed, the, so, called, measurement, problem, he, concluded, that, the, entire, physical, universe, could, be, made, subject, to, the, universal, wave, function, since, something, outside, the, calculation, was, needed, to, collapse, the, wave, function, von, neumann, concluded, that, the, collapse, was, caused, by, the, consciousness, of, the, experimenter, he, argued, that, the, mathematics, of, quantum, mechanics, allows, the, collapse, of, the, wave, function, to, be, placed, at, any, position, in, the, causal, chain, from, the, measurement, device, to, the, subjective, consciousness, of, the, human, observer, in, other, words, while, the, line, between, observer, and, observed, could, be, drawn, in, different, places, the, theory, only, makes, sense, if, an, observer, exists, somewhere, although, the, idea, of, consciousness, causing, collapse, was, accepted, by, eugene, wigner, the, von, neumann, wigner, interpretation, never, gained, acceptance, among, the, majority, of, physicists, though, theories, of, quantum, mechanics, continue, to, evolve, a, basic, framework, for, the, mathematical, formalism, of, problems, in, quantum, mechanics, underlying, most, approaches, can, be, traced, back, to, the, mathematical, formalisms, and, techniques, first, used, by, von, neumann, discussions, about, interpretation, of, the, theory, and, extensions, to, it, are, now, mostly, conducted, on, the, basis, of, shared, assumptions, about, the, mathematical, foundations, viewing, von, neumann, s, work, on, quantum, mechanics, as, a, part, of, the, fulfilment, of, hilbert, s, sixth, problem, mathematical, physicist, arthur, wightman, said, in, 1974, his, axiomization, of, quantum, theory, was, perhaps, the, most, important, axiomization, of, a, physical, theory, to, date, with, his, 1932, book, quantum, mechanics, became, a, mature, theory, in, the, sense, it, had, a, precise, mathematical, form, which, allowed, for, clear, answers, to, conceptual, problems, nevertheless, von, neumann, in, his, later, years, felt, he, had, failed, in, this, aspect, of, his, scientific, work, as, despite, all, the, mathematics, he, developed, he, did, not, find, a, satisfactory, mathematical, framework, for, quantum, theory, as, a, whole, von, neumann, entropy, is, extensively, used, in, different, forms, conditional, entropy, relative, entropy, etc, in, the, framework, of, quantum, information, theory, entanglement, measures, are, based, upon, some, quantity, directly, related, to, the, von, neumann, entropy, given, a, statistical, ensemble, of, quantum, mechanical, systems, with, the, density, matrix, displaystyle, rho, it, is, given, by, s, tr, ln, displaystyle, s, rho, operatorname, tr, rho, ln, rho, many, of, the, same, entropy, measures, in, classical, information, theory, can, also, be, generalized, to, the, quantum, case, such, as, holevo, entropy, and, conditional, quantum, entropy, quantum, information, theory, is, largely, concerned, with, the, interpretation, and, uses, of, von, neumann, entropy, a, cornerstone, in, the, former, s, development, the, shannon, entropy, applies, to, classical, information, theory, the, formalism, of, density, operators, and, matrices, was, introduced, by, von, neumann, in, 1927, and, independently, but, less, systematically, by, lev, landau, and, felix, bloch, in, 1927, and, 1946, respectively, the, density, matrix, allows, the, representation, of, probabilistic, mixtures, of, quantum, states, mixed, states, in, contrast, to, wavefunctions, which, can, only, represent, pure, states, the, von, neumann, measurement, scheme, the, ancestor, of, quantum, decoherence, theory, represents, measurements, projectively, by, taking, into, account, the, measuring, apparatus, which, is, also, treated, as, a, quantum, object, the, projective, measurement, scheme, introduced, by, von, neumann, led, to, the, development, of, quantum, decoherence, theories, von, neumann, first, proposed, a, quantum, logic, in, his, 1932, treatise, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, where, he, noted, that, projections, on, a, hilbert, space, can, be, viewed, as, propositions, about, physical, observables, the, field, of, quantum, logic, was, subsequently, inaugurated, in, a, 1936, paper, by, von, neumann, and, garrett, birkhoff, the, first, to, introduce, quantum, logics, wherein, von, neumann, and, birkhoff, first, proved, that, quantum, mechanics, requires, a, propositional, calculus, substantially, different, from, all, classical, logics, and, rigorously, isolated, a, new, algebraic, structure, for, quantum, logics, the, concept, of, creating, a, propositional, calculus, for, quantum, logic, was, first, outlined, in, a, short, section, in, von, neumann, s, 1932, work, but, in, 1936, the, need, for, the, new, propositional, calculus, was, demonstrated, through, several, proofs, for, example, photons, cannot, pass, through, two, successive, filters, that, are, polarized, perpendicularly, e, g, horizontally, and, vertically, and, therefore, a, fortiori, it, cannot, pass, if, a, third, filter, polarized, diagonally, is, added, to, the, other, two, either, before, or, after, them, in, the, succession, but, if, the, third, filter, is, added, between, the, other, two, the, photons, will, indeed, pass, through, this, experimental, fact, is, translatable, into, logic, as, the, non, commutativity, of, conjunction, a, b, b, a, displaystyle, a, land, b, neq, b, land, a, it, was, also, demonstrated, that, the, laws, of, distribution, of, classical, logic, p, q, r, displaystyle, p, lor, q, land, r, p, q, p, r, displaystyle, p, lor, q, land, p, lor, r, and, p, q, r, displaystyle, p, land, q, lor, r, p, q, p, r, displaystyle, p, land, q, lor, p, land, r, are, not, valid, for, quantum, theory, the, reason, for, this, is, that, a, quantum, disjunction, unlike, the, case, for, classical, disjunction, can, be, true, even, when, both, of, the, disjuncts, are, false, and, this, is, in, turn, attributable, to, the, fact, that, it, is, frequently, the, case, in, quantum, mechanics, that, a, pair, of, alternatives, are, semantically, determinate, while, each, of, its, members, is, necessarily, indeterminate, consequently, the, distributive, law, of, classical, logic, must, be, replaced, with, a, weaker, condition, instead, of, a, distributive, lattice, propositions, about, a, quantum, system, form, an, orthomodular, lattice, isomorphic, to, the, lattice, of, subspaces, of, the, hilbert, space, associated, with, that, system, nevertheless, he, was, never, satisfied, with, his, work, on, quantum, logic, he, intended, it, to, be, a, joint, synthesis, of, formal, logic, and, probability, theory, and, when, he, attempted, to, write, up, a, paper, for, the, henry, joseph, lecture, he, gave, at, the, washington, philosophical, society, in, 1945, he, found, that, he, could, not, especially, given, that, he, was, busy, with, war, work, at, the, time, during, his, address, at, the, 1954, international, congress, of, mathematicians, he, gave, this, issue, as, one, of, the, unsolved, problems, that, future, mathematicians, could, work, on, von, neumann, made, fundamental, contributions, in, the, field, of, fluid, dynamics, including, the, classic, flow, solution, to, blast, waves, and, the, co, discovery, independently, by, yakov, borisovich, zel, dovich, and, werner, d, ring, of, the, znd, detonation, model, of, explosives, during, the, 1930s, von, neumann, became, an, authority, on, the, mathematics, of, shaped, charges, later, with, robert, d, richtmyer, von, neumann, developed, an, algorithm, defining, artificial, viscosity, that, improved, the, understanding, of, shock, waves, when, computers, solved, hydrodynamic, or, aerodynamic, problems, they, put, too, many, computational, grid, points, at, regions, of, sharp, discontinuity, shock, waves, the, mathematics, of, artificial, viscosity, smoothed, the, shock, transition, without, sacrificing, basic, physics, von, neumann, soon, applied, computer, modelling, to, the, field, developing, software, for, his, ballistics, research, during, world, war, ii, he, approached, r, h, kent, the, director, of, the, us, army, s, ballistic, research, laboratory, with, a, computer, program, for, calculating, a, one, dimensional, model, of, 100, molecules, to, simulate, a, shock, wave, von, neumann, gave, a, seminar, on, his, program, to, an, audience, which, included, his, friend, theodore, von, k, rm, n, after, von, neumann, had, finished, von, k, rm, n, said, of, course, you, realize, lagrange, also, used, digital, models, to, simulate, continuum, mechanics, von, neumann, had, been, unaware, of, lagrange, s, m, canique, analytique, while, not, as, prolific, in, physics, as, he, was, in, mathematics, he, nevertheless, made, several, other, notable, contributions, his, pioneering, papers, with, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, on, the, statistics, of, a, fluctuating, gravitational, field, generated, by, randomly, distributed, stars, were, considered, a, tour, de, force, in, this, paper, they, developed, a, theory, of, two, body, relaxation, and, used, the, holtsmark, distribution, to, model, the, dynamics, of, stellar, systems, he, wrote, several, other, unpublished, manuscripts, on, topics, in, stellar, structure, some, of, which, were, included, in, chandrasekhar, s, other, works, in, earlier, work, led, by, oswald, veblen, von, neumann, helped, develop, basic, ideas, involving, spinors, that, would, lead, to, roger, penrose, s, twistor, theory, much, of, this, was, done, in, seminars, conducted, at, the, ias, during, the, 1930s, from, this, work, he, wrote, a, paper, with, a, h, taub, and, veblen, extending, the, dirac, equation, to, projective, relativity, with, a, key, focus, on, maintaining, invariance, with, regards, to, coordinate, spin, and, gauge, transformations, as, a, part, of, early, research, into, potential, theories, of, quantum, gravity, in, the, 1930s, in, the, same, time, period, he, made, several, proposals, to, colleagues, for, dealing, with, the, problems, in, the, newly, created, quantum, field, theory, and, for, quantizing, spacetime, however, both, his, colleagues, and, he, did, not, consider, the, ideas, fruitful, and, did, not, pursue, them, nevertheless, he, maintained, at, least, some, interest, in, 1940, writing, a, manuscript, on, the, dirac, equation, in, de, sitter, space, von, neumann, founded, the, field, of, game, theory, as, a, mathematical, discipline, he, proved, his, minimax, theorem, in, 1928, it, establishes, that, in, zero, sum, games, with, perfect, information, i, e, in, which, players, know, at, each, time, all, moves, that, have, taken, place, so, far, there, exists, a, pair, of, strategies, for, both, players, that, allows, each, to, minimize, their, maximum, losses, such, strategies, are, called, optimal, von, neumann, showed, that, their, minimaxes, are, equal, in, absolute, value, and, contrary, in, sign, he, improved, and, extended, the, minimax, theorem, to, include, games, involving, imperfect, information, and, games, with, more, than, two, players, publishing, this, result, in, his, 1944, theory, of, games, and, economic, behavior, written, with, oskar, morgenstern, the, public, interest, in, this, work, was, such, that, the, new, york, times, ran, a, front, page, story, in, this, book, von, neumann, declared, that, economic, theory, needed, to, use, functional, analysis, especially, convex, sets, and, the, topological, fixed, point, theorem, rather, than, the, traditional, differential, calculus, because, the, maximum, operator, did, not, preserve, differentiable, functions, von, neumann, s, functional, analytic, techniques, the, use, of, duality, pairings, of, real, vector, spaces, to, represent, prices, and, quantities, the, use, of, supporting, and, separating, hyperplanes, and, convex, sets, and, fixed, point, theory, have, been, primary, tools, of, mathematical, economics, ever, since, von, neumann, raised, the, mathematical, level, of, economics, in, several, influential, publications, for, his, model, of, an, expanding, economy, he, proved, the, existence, and, uniqueness, of, an, equilibrium, using, his, generalization, of, the, brouwer, fixed, point, theorem, von, neumann, s, model, of, an, expanding, economy, considered, the, matrix, pencil, a, b, with, nonnegative, matrices, a, and, b, von, neumann, sought, probability, vectors, p, and, q, and, a, positive, number, that, would, solve, the, complementarity, equation, p, t, a, b, q, 0, displaystyle, p, t, a, lambda, b, q, 0, along, with, two, inequality, systems, expressing, economic, efficiency, in, this, model, the, transposed, probability, vector, p, represents, the, prices, of, the, goods, while, the, probability, vector, q, represents, the, intensity, at, which, the, production, process, would, run, the, unique, solution, represents, the, growth, factor, which, is, 1, plus, the, rate, of, growth, of, the, economy, the, rate, of, growth, equals, the, interest, rate, von, neumann, s, results, have, been, viewed, as, a, special, case, of, linear, programming, where, his, model, uses, only, nonnegative, matrices, the, study, of, his, model, of, an, expanding, economy, continues, to, interest, mathematical, economists, this, paper, has, been, called, the, greatest, paper, in, mathematical, economics, by, several, authors, who, recognized, its, introduction, of, fixed, point, theorems, linear, inequalities, complementary, slackness, and, saddlepoint, duality, in, the, proceedings, of, a, conference, on, von, neumann, s, growth, model, paul, samuelson, said, that, many, mathematicians, had, developed, methods, useful, to, economists, but, that, von, neumann, was, unique, in, having, made, significant, contributions, to, economic, theory, itself, the, lasting, importance, of, the, work, on, general, equilibria, and, the, methodology, of, fixed, point, theorems, is, underscored, by, the, awarding, of, nobel, prizes, in, 1972, to, kenneth, arrow, in, 1983, to, g, rard, debreu, and, in, 1994, to, john, nash, who, used, fixed, point, theorems, to, establish, equilibria, for, non, cooperative, games, and, for, bargaining, problems, in, his, ph, d, thesis, arrow, and, debreu, also, used, linear, programming, as, did, nobel, laureates, tjalling, koopmans, leonid, kantorovich, wassily, leontief, paul, samuelson, robert, dorfman, robert, solow, and, leonid, hurwicz, von, neumann, s, interest, in, the, topic, began, while, he, was, lecturing, at, berlin, in, 1928, and, 1929, he, spent, his, summers, in, budapest, as, did, the, economist, nicholas, kaldor, kaldor, recommended, that, von, neumann, read, a, book, by, the, mathematical, economist, l, on, walras, von, neumann, noticed, that, walras, s, general, equilibrium, theory, and, walras, s, law, which, led, to, systems, of, simultaneous, linear, equations, could, produce, the, absurd, result, that, profit, could, be, maximized, by, producing, and, selling, a, negative, quantity, of, a, product, he, replaced, the, equations, by, inequalities, introduced, dynamic, equilibria, among, other, things, and, eventually, produced, his, paper, building, on, his, results, on, matrix, games, and, on, his, model, of, an, expanding, economy, von, neumann, invented, the, theory, of, duality, in, linear, programming, when, george, dantzig, described, his, work, in, a, few, minutes, and, an, impatient, von, neumann, asked, him, to, get, to, the, point, dantzig, then, listened, dumbfounded, while, von, neumann, provided, an, hourlong, lecture, on, convex, sets, fixed, point, theory, and, duality, conjecturing, the, equivalence, between, matrix, games, and, linear, programming, later, von, neumann, suggested, a, new, method, of, linear, programming, using, the, homogeneous, linear, system, of, paul, gordan, 1873, which, was, later, popularized, by, karmarkar, s, algorithm, von, neumann, s, method, used, a, pivoting, algorithm, between, simplices, with, the, pivoting, decision, determined, by, a, nonnegative, least, squares, subproblem, with, a, convexity, constraint, projecting, the, zero, vector, onto, the, convex, hull, of, the, active, simplex, von, neumann, s, algorithm, was, the, first, interior, point, method, of, linear, programming, von, neumann, was, a, founding, figure, in, computing, with, significant, contributions, to, computing, hardware, design, to, theoretical, computer, science, to, scientific, computing, and, to, the, philosophy, of, computer, science, von, neumann, consulted, for, the, army, s, ballistic, research, laboratory, most, notably, on, the, eniac, project, as, a, member, of, its, scientific, advisory, committee, although, the, single, memory, stored, program, architecture, is, commonly, called, von, neumann, architecture, the, architecture, was, based, on, the, work, of, j, presper, eckert, and, john, mauchly, inventors, of, eniac, and, its, successor, edvac, while, consulting, for, the, edvac, project, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, von, neumann, wrote, an, incomplete, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, the, paper, whose, premature, distribution, nullified, the, patent, claims, of, eckert, and, mauchly, described, a, computer, that, stored, both, its, data, and, its, program, in, the, same, address, space, unlike, the, earliest, computers, which, stored, their, programs, separately, on, paper, tape, or, plugboards, this, architecture, became, the, basis, of, most, modern, computer, designs, next, von, neumann, designed, the, ias, machine, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, he, arranged, its, financing, and, the, components, were, designed, and, built, at, the, rca, research, laboratory, nearby, von, neumann, recommended, that, the, ibm, 701, nicknamed, the, defense, computer, include, a, magnetic, drum, it, was, a, faster, version, of, the, ias, machine, and, formed, the, basis, for, the, commercially, successful, ibm, 704, von, neumann, was, the, inventor, in, 1945, of, the, merge, sort, algorithm, in, which, the, first, and, second, halves, of, an, array, are, each, sorted, recursively, and, then, merged, as, part, of, von, neumann, s, hydrogen, bomb, work, he, and, stanis, aw, ulam, developed, simulations, for, hydrodynamic, computations, he, also, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, monte, carlo, method, which, used, random, numbers, to, approximate, the, solutions, to, complicated, problems, von, neumann, s, algorithm, for, simulating, a, fair, coin, with, a, biased, coin, is, used, in, the, software, whitening, stage, of, some, hardware, random, number, generators, because, obtaining, truly, random, numbers, was, impractical, von, neumann, developed, a, form, of, pseudorandomness, using, the, middle, square, method, he, justified, this, crude, method, as, faster, than, any, other, method, at, his, disposal, writing, that, anyone, who, considers, arithmetical, methods, of, producing, random, digits, is, of, course, in, a, state, of, sin, he, also, noted, that, when, this, method, went, awry, it, did, so, obviously, unlike, other, methods, which, could, be, subtly, incorrect, stochastic, computing, was, introduced, by, von, neumann, in, 1953, but, could, not, be, implemented, until, advances, in, computing, of, the, 1960s, around, 1950, he, was, also, among, the, first, to, talk, about, the, time, complexity, of, computations, which, eventually, evolved, into, the, field, of, computational, complexity, theory, von, neumann, s, mathematical, analysis, of, the, structure, of, self, replication, preceded, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, ulam, and, von, neumann, are, also, generally, credited, with, creating, the, field, of, cellular, automata, beginning, in, the, 1940s, as, a, simplified, mathematical, model, of, biological, systems, in, lectures, in, 1948, and, 1949, von, neumann, proposed, a, kinematic, self, reproducing, automaton, by, 1952, he, was, treating, the, problem, more, abstractly, he, designed, an, elaborate, 2d, cellular, automaton, that, would, automatically, make, a, copy, of, its, initial, configuration, of, cells, the, von, neumann, universal, constructor, based, on, the, von, neumann, cellular, automaton, was, fleshed, out, in, his, posthumous, theory, of, self, reproducing, automata, the, von, neumann, neighborhood, in, which, each, cell, in, a, two, dimensional, grid, has, the, four, orthogonally, adjacent, grid, cells, as, neighbors, continues, to, be, used, for, other, cellular, automata, considered, to, be, possibly, the, most, influential, researcher, in, scientific, computing, of, all, time, von, neumann, made, several, contributions, to, the, field, both, technically, and, administratively, he, developed, the, von, neumann, stability, analysis, procedure, still, commonly, used, to, avoid, errors, from, building, up, in, numerical, methods, for, linear, partial, differential, equations, his, paper, with, herman, goldstine, in, 1947, was, the, first, to, describe, backward, error, analysis, although, implicitly, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, write, about, the, jacobi, method, at, los, alamos, he, wrote, several, classified, reports, on, solving, problems, of, gas, dynamics, numerically, however, he, was, frustrated, by, the, lack, of, progress, with, analytic, methods, for, these, nonlinear, problems, as, a, result, he, turned, towards, computational, methods, under, his, influence, los, alamos, became, the, leader, in, computational, science, during, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, from, this, work, von, neumann, realized, that, computation, was, not, just, a, tool, to, brute, force, the, solution, to, a, problem, numerically, but, could, also, provide, insight, for, solving, problems, analytically, and, that, there, was, an, enormous, variety, of, scientific, and, engineering, problems, towards, which, computers, would, be, useful, most, significant, of, which, were, nonlinear, problems, in, june, 1945, at, the, first, canadian, mathematical, congress, he, gave, his, first, talk, on, general, ideas, of, how, to, solve, problems, particularly, of, fluid, dynamics, numerically, he, also, described, how, wind, tunnels, were, actually, analog, computers, and, how, digital, computers, would, replace, them, and, bring, a, new, era, of, fluid, dynamics, garrett, birkhoff, described, it, as, an, unforgettable, sales, pitch, he, expanded, this, talk, with, goldstine, into, the, manuscript, on, the, principles, of, large, scale, computing, machines, and, used, it, to, promote, the, support, of, scientific, computing, his, papers, also, developed, the, concepts, of, inverting, matrices, random, matrices, and, automated, relaxation, methods, for, solving, elliptic, boundary, value, problems, as, part, of, his, research, into, possible, applications, of, computers, von, neumann, became, interested, in, weather, prediction, noting, similarities, between, the, problems, in, the, field, and, those, he, had, worked, on, during, the, manhattan, project, in, 1946, von, neumann, founded, the, meteorological, project, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, securing, funding, for, his, project, from, the, weather, bureau, the, us, air, force, and, us, navy, weather, services, with, carl, gustaf, rossby, considered, the, leading, theoretical, meteorologist, at, the, time, he, gathered, a, group, of, twenty, meteorologists, to, work, on, various, problems, in, the, field, however, given, his, other, postwar, work, he, was, not, able, to, devote, enough, time, to, proper, leadership, of, the, project, and, little, was, accomplished, this, changed, when, a, young, jule, gregory, charney, took, up, co, leadership, of, the, project, from, rossby, by, 1950, von, neumann, and, charney, wrote, the, world, s, first, climate, modelling, software, and, used, it, to, perform, the, world, s, first, numerical, weather, forecasts, on, the, eniac, computer, that, von, neumann, had, arranged, to, be, used, von, neumann, and, his, team, published, the, results, as, numerical, integration, of, the, barotropic, vorticity, equation, together, they, played, a, leading, role, in, efforts, to, integrate, sea, air, exchanges, of, energy, and, moisture, into, the, study, of, climate, though, primitive, news, of, the, eniac, forecasts, quickly, spread, around, the, world, and, a, number, of, parallel, projects, in, other, locations, were, initiated, in, 1955, von, neumann, charney, and, their, collaborators, convinced, their, funders, to, open, the, joint, numerical, weather, prediction, unit, jnwpu, in, suitland, maryland, which, began, routine, real, time, weather, forecasting, next, up, von, neumann, proposed, a, research, program, for, climate, modeling, the, approach, is, to, first, try, short, range, forecasts, then, long, range, forecasts, of, those, properties, of, the, circulation, that, can, perpetuate, themselves, over, arbitrarily, long, periods, of, time, and, only, finally, to, attempt, forecast, for, medium, long, time, periods, which, are, too, long, to, treat, by, simple, hydrodynamic, theory, and, too, short, to, treat, by, the, general, principle, of, equilibrium, theory, positive, results, of, norman, a, phillips, in, 1955, prompted, immediate, reaction, and, von, neumann, organized, a, conference, at, princeton, on, application, of, numerical, integration, techniques, to, the, problem, of, the, general, circulation, once, again, he, strategically, organized, the, program, as, a, predictive, one, to, ensure, continued, support, from, the, weather, bureau, and, the, military, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, general, circulation, research, section, now, the, geophysical, fluid, dynamics, laboratory, next, to, the, jnwpu, he, continued, work, both, on, technical, issues, of, modelling, and, in, ensuring, continuing, funding, for, these, projects, during, the, late, 19th, century, svante, arrhenius, suggested, that, human, activity, could, cause, global, warming, by, adding, carbon, dioxide, to, the, atmosphere, in, 1955, von, neumann, observed, that, this, may, already, have, begun, carbon, dioxide, released, into, the, atmosphere, by, industry, s, burning, of, coal, and, oil, more, than, half, of, it, during, the, last, generation, may, have, changed, the, atmosphere, s, composition, sufficiently, to, account, for, a, general, warming, of, the, world, by, about, one, degree, fahrenheit, his, research, into, weather, systems, and, meteorological, prediction, led, him, to, propose, manipulating, the, environment, by, spreading, colorants, on, the, polar, ice, caps, to, enhance, absorption, of, solar, radiation, by, reducing, the, albedo, however, he, urged, caution, in, any, program, of, atmosphere, modification, what, could, be, done, of, course, is, no, index, to, what, should, be, done, in, fact, to, evaluate, the, ultimate, consequences, of, either, a, general, cooling, or, a, general, heating, would, be, a, complex, matter, changes, would, affect, the, level, of, the, seas, and, hence, the, habitability, of, the, continental, coastal, shelves, the, evaporation, of, the, seas, and, hence, general, precipitation, and, glaciation, levels, and, so, on, but, there, is, little, doubt, that, one, could, carry, out, the, necessary, analyses, needed, to, predict, the, results, intervene, on, any, desired, scale, and, ultimately, achieve, rather, fantastic, results, he, also, warned, that, weather, and, climate, control, could, have, military, uses, telling, congress, in, 1956, that, they, could, pose, an, even, bigger, risk, than, icbms, the, technology, that, is, now, developing, and, that, will, dominate, the, next, decades, is, in, conflict, with, traditional, and, in, the, main, momentarily, still, valid, geographical, and, political, units, and, concepts, this, is, a, maturing, crisis, of, technology, the, most, hopeful, answer, is, that, the, human, species, has, been, subjected, to, similar, tests, before, and, it, seems, to, have, a, congenital, ability, to, come, through, after, varying, amounts, of, trouble, von, neumann, 1955, the, first, use, of, the, concept, of, a, singularity, in, the, technological, context, is, attributed, to, von, neumann, who, according, to, ulam, discussed, the, ever, accelerating, progress, of, technology, and, changes, in, the, mode, of, human, life, which, gives, the, appearance, of, approaching, some, essential, singularity, in, the, history, of, the, race, beyond, which, human, affairs, as, we, know, them, could, not, continue, this, concept, was, fleshed, out, later, in, the, book, future, shock, by, alvin, toffler, beginning, in, the, late, 1930s, von, neumann, developed, an, expertise, in, explosions, phenomena, that, are, difficult, to, model, mathematically, during, this, period, he, was, the, leading, authority, of, the, mathematics, of, shaped, charges, leading, him, to, a, large, number, of, military, consultancies, and, consequently, his, involvement, in, the, manhattan, project, the, involvement, included, frequent, trips, to, the, project, s, secret, research, facilities, at, the, los, alamos, laboratory, in, new, mexico, von, neumann, made, his, principal, contribution, to, the, atomic, bomb, in, the, concept, and, design, of, the, explosive, lenses, that, were, needed, to, compress, the, plutonium, core, of, the, fat, man, weapon, that, was, later, dropped, on, nagasaki, while, von, neumann, did, not, originate, the, implosion, concept, he, was, one, of, its, most, persistent, proponents, encouraging, its, continued, development, against, the, instincts, of, many, of, his, colleagues, who, felt, such, a, design, to, be, unworkable, he, also, eventually, came, up, with, the, idea, of, using, more, powerful, shaped, charges, and, less, fissionable, material, to, greatly, increase, the, speed, of, assembly, when, it, turned, out, that, there, would, not, be, enough, uranium, 235, to, make, more, than, one, bomb, the, implosive, lens, project, was, greatly, expanded, and, von, neumann, s, idea, was, implemented, implosion, was, the, only, method, that, could, be, used, with, the, plutonium, 239, that, was, available, from, the, hanford, site, he, established, the, design, of, the, explosive, lenses, required, but, there, remained, concerns, about, edge, effects, and, imperfections, in, the, explosives, his, calculations, showed, that, implosion, would, work, if, it, did, not, depart, by, more, than, 5, from, spherical, symmetry, after, a, series, of, failed, attempts, with, models, this, was, achieved, by, george, kistiakowsky, and, the, construction, of, the, trinity, bomb, was, completed, in, july, 1945, in, a, visit, to, los, alamos, in, september, 1944, von, neumann, showed, that, the, pressure, increase, from, explosion, shock, wave, reflection, from, solid, objects, was, greater, than, previously, believed, if, the, angle, of, incidence, of, the, shock, wave, was, between, 90, and, some, limiting, angle, as, a, result, it, was, determined, that, the, effectiveness, of, an, atomic, bomb, would, be, enhanced, with, detonation, some, kilometers, above, the, target, rather, than, at, ground, level, von, neumann, was, included, in, the, target, selection, committee, that, was, responsible, for, choosing, the, japanese, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, as, the, first, targets, of, the, atomic, bomb, von, neumann, oversaw, computations, related, to, the, expected, size, of, the, bomb, blasts, estimated, death, tolls, and, the, distance, above, the, ground, at, which, the, bombs, should, be, detonated, for, optimum, shock, wave, propagation, the, cultural, capital, kyoto, was, von, neumann, s, first, choice, a, selection, seconded, by, manhattan, project, leader, general, leslie, groves, however, this, target, was, dismissed, by, secretary, of, war, henry, l, stimson, on, july, 16, 1945, von, neumann, and, numerous, other, manhattan, project, personnel, were, eyewitnesses, to, the, first, test, of, an, atomic, bomb, detonation, which, was, code, named, trinity, the, event, was, conducted, as, a, test, of, the, implosion, method, device, at, the, alamogordo, bombing, range, in, new, mexico, based, on, his, observation, alone, von, neumann, estimated, the, test, had, resulted, in, a, blast, equivalent, to, 5, kilotons, of, tnt, 21, tj, but, enrico, fermi, produced, a, more, accurate, estimate, of, 10, kilotons, by, dropping, scraps, of, torn, up, paper, as, the, shock, wave, passed, his, location, and, watching, how, far, they, scattered, the, actual, power, of, the, explosion, had, been, between, 20, and, 22, kilotons, it, was, in, von, neumann, s, 1944, papers, that, the, expression, kilotons, appeared, for, the, first, time, von, neumann, continued, unperturbed, in, his, work, and, became, along, with, edward, teller, one, of, those, who, sustained, the, hydrogen, bomb, project, he, collaborated, with, klaus, fuchs, on, further, development, of, the, bomb, and, in, 1946, the, two, filed, a, secret, patent, outlining, a, scheme, for, using, a, fission, bomb, to, compress, fusion, fuel, to, initiate, nuclear, fusion, the, fuchs, von, neumann, patent, used, radiation, implosion, but, not, in, the, same, way, as, is, used, in, what, became, the, final, hydrogen, bomb, design, the, teller, ulam, design, their, work, was, however, incorporated, into, the, george, shot, of, operation, greenhouse, which, was, instructive, in, testing, out, concepts, that, went, into, the, final, design, the, fuchs, von, neumann, work, was, passed, on, to, the, soviet, union, by, fuchs, as, part, of, his, nuclear, espionage, but, it, was, not, used, in, the, soviets, own, independent, development, of, the, teller, ulam, design, the, historian, jeremy, bernstein, has, pointed, out, that, ironically, john, von, neumann, and, klaus, fuchs, produced, a, brilliant, invention, in, 1946, that, could, have, changed, the, whole, course, of, the, development, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, but, was, not, fully, understood, until, after, the, bomb, had, been, successfully, made, for, his, wartime, services, von, neumann, was, awarded, the, navy, distinguished, civilian, service, award, in, july, 1946, and, the, medal, for, merit, in, october, 1946, in, 1950, von, neumann, became, a, consultant, to, the, weapons, systems, evaluation, group, whose, function, was, to, advise, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, and, the, united, states, secretary, of, defense, on, the, development, and, use, of, new, technologies, he, also, became, an, adviser, to, the, armed, forces, special, weapons, project, which, was, responsible, for, the, military, aspects, on, nuclear, weapons, over, the, following, two, years, he, became, a, consultant, across, the, us, government, this, included, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, a, member, of, the, influential, general, advisory, committee, of, the, atomic, energy, commission, a, consultant, to, the, newly, established, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, and, a, member, of, the, scientific, advisory, group, of, the, united, states, air, force, during, this, time, he, became, a, superstar, defense, scientist, at, the, pentagon, his, authority, was, considered, infallible, at, the, highest, levels, of, the, us, government, and, military, during, several, meetings, of, the, advisory, board, of, the, us, air, force, von, neumann, and, edward, teller, predicted, that, by, 1960, the, us, would, be, able, to, build, a, hydrogen, bomb, light, enough, to, fit, on, top, of, a, rocket, in, 1953, bernard, schriever, who, was, present, at, the, meeting, paid, a, personal, visit, to, von, neumann, at, princeton, to, confirm, this, possibility, schriever, enlisted, trevor, gardner, who, in, turn, visited, von, neumann, several, weeks, later, to, fully, understand, the, future, possibilities, before, beginning, his, campaign, for, such, a, weapon, in, washington, now, either, chairing, or, serving, on, several, boards, dealing, with, strategic, missiles, and, nuclear, weaponry, von, neumann, was, able, to, inject, several, crucial, arguments, regarding, potential, soviet, advancements, in, both, these, areas, and, in, strategic, defenses, against, american, bombers, into, government, reports, to, argue, for, the, creation, of, icbms, gardner, on, several, occasions, brought, von, neumann, to, meetings, with, the, us, department, of, defense, to, discuss, with, various, senior, officials, his, reports, several, design, decisions, in, these, reports, such, as, inertial, guidance, mechanisms, would, form, the, basis, for, all, icbms, thereafter, by, 1954, von, neumann, was, also, regularly, testifying, to, various, congressional, military, subcommittees, to, ensure, continued, support, for, the, icbm, program, however, this, was, not, enough, to, have, the, icbm, program, run, at, full, throttle, they, needed, direct, action, by, the, president, of, the, united, states, they, convinced, president, eisenhower, in, a, direct, meeting, in, july, 1955, which, resulted, in, a, presidential, directive, on, september, 13, 1955, it, stated, that, there, would, be, the, gravest, repercussions, on, the, national, security, and, on, the, cohesion, of, the, free, world, if, the, soviet, union, developed, the, icbm, before, the, us, and, therefore, designated, the, icbm, project, a, research, and, development, program, of, the, highest, priority, above, all, others, the, secretary, of, defense, was, ordered, to, commence, the, project, with, maximum, urgency, evidence, would, later, show, that, the, soviets, indeed, were, already, testing, their, own, intermediate, range, ballistic, missiles, at, the, time, von, neumann, would, continue, to, meet, the, president, including, at, his, home, in, gettysburg, pennsylvania, and, other, high, level, government, officials, as, a, key, advisor, on, icbms, until, his, death, in, 1955, von, neumann, became, a, commissioner, of, the, atomic, energy, commission, aec, which, at, the, time, was, the, highest, official, position, available, to, scientists, in, the, government, while, his, appointment, formally, required, that, he, sever, all, his, other, consulting, contracts, an, exemption, was, made, for, von, neumann, to, continue, working, with, several, critical, military, committees, after, the, air, force, and, several, key, senators, raised, concerns, he, used, this, position, to, further, the, production, of, compact, hydrogen, bombs, suitable, for, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, delivery, he, involved, himself, in, correcting, the, severe, shortage, of, tritium, and, lithium, 6, needed, for, these, weapons, and, he, argued, against, settling, for, the, intermediate, range, missiles, that, the, army, wanted, he, was, adamant, that, h, bombs, delivered, deep, into, enemy, territory, by, an, icbm, would, be, the, most, effective, weapon, possible, and, that, the, relative, inaccuracy, of, the, missile, would, not, be, a, problem, with, an, h, bomb, he, said, the, russians, would, probably, be, building, a, similar, weapon, system, which, turned, out, to, be, the, case, while, lewis, strauss, was, away, in, the, second, half, of, 1955, von, neumann, took, over, as, acting, chairman, of, the, commission, in, his, final, years, before, his, death, from, cancer, von, neumann, headed, the, united, states, government, s, top, secret, icbm, committee, which, would, sometimes, meet, in, his, home, its, purpose, was, to, decide, on, the, feasibility, of, building, an, icbm, large, enough, to, carry, a, thermonuclear, weapon, von, neumann, had, long, argued, that, while, the, technical, obstacles, were, sizable, they, could, be, overcome, the, sm, 65, atlas, passed, its, first, fully, functional, test, in, 1959, two, years, after, his, death, the, more, advanced, titan, rockets, were, deployed, in, 1962, both, had, been, proposed, in, the, icbm, committees, von, neumann, chaired, the, feasibility, of, the, icbms, owed, as, much, to, improved, smaller, warheads, that, did, not, have, guidance, or, heat, resistance, issues, as, it, did, to, developments, in, rocketry, and, his, understanding, of, the, former, made, his, advice, invaluable, von, neumann, entered, government, service, primarily, because, he, felt, that, if, freedom, and, civilization, were, to, survive, it, would, have, to, be, because, the, united, states, would, triumph, over, totalitarianism, from, nazism, fascism, and, soviet, communism, during, a, senate, committee, hearing, he, described, his, political, ideology, as, violently, anti, communist, and, much, more, militaristic, than, the, norm, herman, goldstine, commented, on, von, neumann, s, ability, to, intuit, hidden, errors, and, remember, old, material, perfectly, when, he, had, difficulties, he, would, not, labor, on, instead, he, would, go, home, and, sleep, on, it, and, come, back, later, with, a, solution, this, style, taking, the, path, of, least, resistance, sometimes, meant, that, he, could, go, off, on, tangents, it, also, meant, that, if, the, difficulty, was, great, from, the, very, beginning, he, would, simply, switch, to, another, problem, not, trying, to, find, weak, spots, from, which, he, could, break, through, at, times, he, could, be, ignorant, of, the, standard, mathematical, literature, finding, it, easier, to, rederive, basic, information, he, needed, rather, than, chase, references, after, world, war, ii, began, he, became, extremely, busy, with, both, academic, and, military, commitments, his, habit, of, not, writing, up, talks, or, publishing, results, worsened, he, did, not, find, it, easy, to, discuss, a, topic, formally, in, writing, unless, it, was, already, mature, in, his, mind, if, it, was, not, he, would, in, his, own, words, develop, the, worst, traits, of, pedantism, and, inefficiency, the, mathematician, jean, dieudonn, said, that, von, neumann, may, have, been, the, last, representative, of, a, once, flourishing, and, numerous, group, the, great, mathematicians, who, were, equally, at, home, in, pure, and, applied, mathematics, and, who, throughout, their, careers, maintained, a, steady, production, in, both, directions, according, to, dieudonn, his, specific, genius, was, in, analysis, and, combinatorics, with, combinatorics, being, understood, in, a, very, wide, sense, that, described, his, ability, to, organize, and, axiomize, complex, works, that, previously, seemed, to, have, little, connection, with, mathematics, his, style, in, analysis, followed, the, german, school, based, on, foundations, in, linear, algebra, and, general, topology, while, von, neumann, had, an, encyclopedic, background, his, range, in, pure, mathematics, was, not, as, wide, as, poincar, hilbert, or, even, weyl, von, neumann, never, did, significant, work, in, number, theory, algebraic, topology, algebraic, geometry, or, differential, geometry, however, in, applied, mathematics, his, work, equalled, that, of, gauss, cauchy, or, poincar, according, to, wigner, nobody, knows, all, science, not, even, von, neumann, did, but, as, for, mathematics, he, contributed, to, every, part, of, it, except, number, theory, and, topology, that, is, i, think, something, unique, halmos, noted, that, while, von, neumann, knew, lots, of, mathematics, the, most, notable, gaps, were, in, algebraic, topology, and, number, theory, he, recalled, an, incident, where, von, neumann, failed, to, recognize, the, topological, definition, of, a, torus, von, neumann, admitted, to, herman, goldstine, that, he, had, no, facility, at, all, in, topology, and, he, was, never, comfortable, with, it, with, goldstine, later, bringing, this, up, when, comparing, him, to, hermann, weyl, who, he, thought, was, deeper, and, broader, in, his, biography, of, von, neumann, salomon, bochner, wrote, that, much, of, von, neumann, s, works, in, pure, mathematics, involved, finite, and, infinite, dimensional, vector, spaces, which, at, the, time, covered, much, of, the, total, area, of, mathematics, however, he, pointed, out, this, still, did, not, cover, an, important, part, of, the, mathematical, landscape, in, particular, anything, that, involved, geometry, in, the, global, sense, topics, such, as, topology, differential, geometry, and, harmonic, integrals, algebraic, geometry, and, other, such, fields, von, neumann, rarely, worked, in, these, fields, and, as, bochner, saw, it, had, little, affinity, for, them, in, one, of, von, neumann, s, last, articles, he, lamented, that, pure, mathematicians, could, no, longer, attain, deep, knowledge, of, even, a, fraction, of, the, field, in, the, early, 1940s, ulam, had, concocted, for, him, a, doctoral, style, examination, to, find, weaknesses, in, his, knowledge, von, neumann, was, unable, to, answer, satisfactorily, a, question, each, in, differential, geometry, number, theory, and, algebra, they, concluded, that, doctoral, exams, might, have, little, permanent, meaning, however, when, weyl, turned, down, an, offer, to, write, a, history, of, mathematics, of, the, 20th, century, arguing, that, no, one, person, could, do, it, ulam, thought, von, neumann, could, have, aspired, to, do, so, ulam, remarked, that, most, mathematicians, could, master, one, technique, that, they, then, used, repeatedly, whereas, von, neumann, had, mastered, three, although, he, was, commonly, described, as, an, analyst, he, once, classified, himself, an, algebraist, and, his, style, often, displayed, a, mix, of, algebraic, technique, and, set, theoretical, intuition, he, loved, obsessive, detail, and, had, no, issues, with, excess, repetition, or, overly, explicit, notation, an, example, of, this, was, a, paper, of, his, on, rings, of, operators, where, he, extended, the, normal, functional, notation, x, displaystyle, phi, x, to, x, displaystyle, phi, x, however, this, process, ended, up, being, repeated, several, times, where, the, final, result, were, equations, such, as, a, 2, a, displaystyle, psi, a, 2, phi, a, the, 1936, paper, became, known, to, students, as, von, neumann, s, onion, because, the, equations, needed, to, be, peeled, before, they, could, be, digested, overall, although, his, writings, were, clear, and, powerful, they, were, not, clean, or, elegant, although, powerful, technically, his, primary, concern, was, more, with, the, clear, and, viable, formation, of, fundamental, issues, and, questions, of, science, rather, than, just, the, solution, of, mathematical, puzzles, according, to, ulam, von, neumann, surprised, physicists, by, doing, dimensional, estimates, and, algebraic, computations, in, his, head, with, fluency, ulam, likened, to, blindfold, chess, his, impression, was, that, von, neumann, analyzed, physical, situations, by, abstract, logical, deduction, rather, than, concrete, visualization, goldstine, compared, his, lectures, to, being, on, glass, smooth, and, lucid, by, comparison, goldstine, thought, his, scientific, articles, were, written, in, a, much, harsher, manner, and, with, much, less, insight, halmos, described, his, lectures, as, dazzling, with, his, speech, clear, rapid, precise, and, all, encompassing, like, goldstine, he, also, described, how, everything, seemed, so, easy, and, natural, in, lectures, but, puzzling, on, later, reflection, he, was, a, quick, speaker, banesh, hoffmann, found, it, very, difficult, to, take, notes, even, in, shorthand, and, albert, tucker, said, that, people, often, had, to, ask, von, neumann, questions, to, slow, him, down, so, they, could, think, through, the, ideas, he, was, presenting, von, neumann, knew, about, this, and, was, grateful, for, his, audience, telling, him, when, he, was, going, too, quickly, although, he, did, spend, time, preparing, for, lectures, he, rarely, used, notes, instead, jotting, down, points, of, what, he, would, discuss, and, for, how, long, von, neumann, was, also, noted, for, his, eidetic, memory, particularly, of, the, symbolic, kind, herman, goldstine, writes, one, of, his, remarkable, abilities, was, his, power, of, absolute, recall, as, far, as, i, could, tell, von, neumann, was, able, on, once, reading, a, book, or, article, to, quote, it, back, verbatim, moreover, he, could, do, it, years, later, without, hesitation, he, could, also, translate, it, at, no, diminution, in, speed, from, its, original, language, into, english, on, one, occasion, i, tested, his, ability, by, asking, him, to, tell, me, how, a, tale, of, two, cities, started, whereupon, without, any, pause, he, immediately, began, to, recite, the, first, chapter, and, continued, until, asked, to, stop, after, about, ten, or, fifteen, minutes, von, neumann, was, reportedly, able, to, memorize, the, pages, of, telephone, directories, he, entertained, friends, by, asking, them, to, randomly, call, out, page, numbers, he, then, recited, the, names, addresses, and, numbers, therein, stanis, aw, ulam, believed, that, von, neumann, s, memory, was, auditory, rather, than, visual, von, neumann, s, mathematical, fluency, calculation, speed, and, general, problem, solving, ability, were, widely, noted, by, his, peers, paul, halmos, called, his, speed, awe, inspiring, lothar, wolfgang, nordheim, described, him, as, the, fastest, mind, i, ever, met, enrico, fermi, told, physicist, herbert, l, anderson, you, know, herb, johnny, can, do, calculations, in, his, head, ten, times, as, fast, as, i, can, and, i, can, do, them, ten, times, as, fast, as, you, can, herb, so, you, can, see, how, impressive, johnny, is, edward, teller, admitted, that, he, never, could, keep, up, with, him, and, israel, halperin, described, trying, to, keep, up, as, like, riding, a, tricycle, chasing, a, racing, car, he, had, an, unusual, ability, to, solve, novel, problems, quickly, george, p, lya, whose, lectures, at, eth, z, rich, von, neumann, attended, as, a, student, said, johnny, was, the, only, student, i, was, ever, afraid, of, if, in, the, course, of, a, lecture, i, stated, an, unsolved, problem, the, chances, were, he, d, come, to, me, at, the, end, of, the, lecture, with, the, complete, solution, scribbled, on, a, slip, of, paper, when, george, dantzig, brought, von, neumann, an, unsolved, problem, in, linear, programming, as, i, would, to, an, ordinary, mortal, on, which, there, had, been, no, published, literature, he, was, astonished, when, von, neumann, said, oh, that, before, offhandedly, giving, a, lecture, of, over, an, hour, explaining, how, to, solve, the, problem, using, the, hitherto, unconceived, theory, of, duality, a, story, about, von, neumann, s, encounter, with, the, famous, fly, puzzle, has, entered, mathematical, folklore, in, this, puzzle, two, bicycles, begin, 20, miles, apart, and, each, travels, toward, the, other, at, 10, miles, per, hour, until, they, collide, meanwhile, a, fly, travels, continuously, back, and, forth, between, the, bicycles, at, 15, miles, per, hour, until, it, is, squashed, in, the, collision, the, questioner, asks, how, far, the, fly, traveled, in, total, the, trick, for, a, quick, answer, is, to, realize, that, the, fly, s, individual, transits, do, not, matter, only, that, it, has, been, traveling, at, 15, miles, per, hour, for, one, hour, as, eugene, wigner, tells, it, max, born, posed, the, riddle, to, von, neumann, the, other, scientists, to, whom, he, had, posed, it, had, laboriously, computed, the, distance, so, when, von, neumann, was, immediately, ready, with, the, correct, answer, of, 15, miles, born, observed, that, he, must, have, guessed, the, trick, what, trick, von, neumann, replied, all, i, did, was, sum, the, geometric, series, rota, wrote, that, von, neumann, had, deep, seated, and, recurring, self, doubts, john, l, kelley, reminisced, in, 1989, that, johnny, von, neumann, has, said, that, he, will, be, forgotten, while, kurt, g, del, is, remembered, with, pythagoras, but, the, rest, of, us, viewed, johnny, with, awe, ulam, suggests, that, some, of, his, self, doubts, with, regard, for, his, own, creativity, may, have, come, from, the, fact, he, had, not, discovered, several, important, ideas, that, others, had, even, though, he, was, more, than, capable, of, doing, so, giving, the, incompleteness, theorems, and, birkhoff, s, pointwise, ergodic, theorem, as, examples, von, neumann, had, a, virtuosity, in, following, complicated, reasoning, and, had, supreme, insights, yet, he, perhaps, felt, he, did, not, have, the, gift, for, seemingly, irrational, proofs, and, theorems, or, intuitive, insights, ulam, describes, how, during, one, of, his, stays, at, princeton, while, von, neumann, was, working, on, rings, of, operators, continuous, geometries, and, quantum, logic, he, felt, that, von, neumann, was, not, convinced, of, the, importance, of, his, work, and, only, when, finding, some, ingenious, technical, trick, or, new, approach, that, he, took, some, pleasure, in, it, however, according, to, rota, von, neumann, still, had, an, incomparably, stronger, technique, compared, to, his, friend, despite, describing, ulam, as, the, more, creative, mathematician, nobel, laureate, hans, bethe, said, i, have, sometimes, wondered, whether, a, brain, like, von, neumann, s, does, not, indicate, a, species, superior, to, that, of, man, edward, teller, observed, von, neumann, would, carry, on, a, conversation, with, my, 3, year, old, son, and, the, two, of, them, would, talk, as, equals, and, i, sometimes, wondered, if, he, used, the, same, principle, when, he, talked, to, the, rest, of, us, peter, lax, wrote, von, neumann, was, addicted, to, thinking, and, in, particular, to, thinking, about, mathematics, eugene, wigner, said, he, understood, mathematical, problems, not, only, in, their, initial, aspect, but, in, their, full, complexity, claude, shannon, called, him, the, smartest, person, i, ve, ever, met, a, common, opinion, jacob, bronowski, wrote, he, was, the, cleverest, man, i, ever, knew, without, exception, he, was, a, genius, it, seems, fair, to, say, that, if, the, influence, of, a, scientist, is, interpreted, broadly, enough, to, include, impact, on, fields, beyond, science, proper, then, john, von, neumann, was, probably, the, most, influential, mathematician, who, ever, lived, wrote, mikl, s, r, dei, peter, lax, commented, that, von, neumann, would, have, won, a, nobel, prize, in, economics, had, he, lived, longer, and, that, if, there, were, nobel, prizes, in, computer, science, and, mathematics, he, would, have, been, honored, by, these, too, rota, writes, that, he, was, the, first, to, have, a, vision, of, the, boundless, possibilities, of, computing, and, he, had, the, resolve, to, gather, the, considerable, intellectual, and, engineering, resources, that, led, to, the, construction, of, the, first, large, computer, and, consequently, that, no, other, mathematician, in, this, century, has, had, as, deep, and, lasting, an, influence, on, the, course, of, civilization, he, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, influential, mathematicians, and, scientists, of, the, 20th, century, neurophysiologist, leon, harmon, described, him, in, a, similar, manner, calling, him, the, only, true, genius, he, had, ever, met, von, neumann, s, mind, was, all, encompassing, he, could, solve, problems, in, any, domain, and, his, mind, was, always, working, always, restless, while, consulting, for, non, academic, projects, von, neumann, s, combination, of, outstanding, scientific, ability, and, practicality, gave, him, a, high, credibility, with, military, officers, engineers, and, industrialists, that, no, other, scientist, could, match, in, nuclear, missilery, he, was, considered, the, clearly, dominant, advisory, figure, according, to, herbert, york, economist, nicholas, kaldor, said, he, was, unquestionably, the, nearest, thing, to, a, genius, i, have, ever, encountered, likewise, paul, samuelson, wrote, we, economists, are, grateful, for, von, neumann, s, genius, it, is, not, for, us, to, calculate, whether, he, was, a, gauss, or, a, poincar, or, a, hilbert, he, was, the, incomparable, johnny, von, neumann, he, darted, briefly, into, our, domain, and, it, has, never, been, the, same, since, events, and, awards, named, in, recognition, of, von, neumann, include, the, annual, john, von, neumann, theory, prize, of, the, institute, for, operations, research, and, the, management, sciences, ieee, john, von, neumann, medal, and, the, john, von, neumann, prize, of, the, society, for, industrial, and, applied, mathematics, both, the, crater, von, neumann, on, the, moon, and, the, asteroid, 22824, von, neumann, are, named, in, his, honor, von, neumann, received, awards, including, the, medal, for, merit, in, 1947, the, medal, of, freedom, in, 1956, and, the, enrico, fermi, award, also, in, 1956, he, was, elected, a, member, of, multiple, honorary, societies, including, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, and, the, national, academy, of, sciences, and, he, held, eight, honorary, doctorates, on, may, 4, 2005, the, united, states, postal, service, issued, the, american, scientists, commemorative, postage, stamp, series, designed, by, artist, victor, stabin, the, scientists, depicted, were, von, neumann, barbara, mcclintock, josiah, willard, gibbs, and, richard, feynman, john, von, neumann, university, was, established, in, kecskem, t, hungary, in, 2016, as, a, successor, to, kecskem, t, college, von, neumann, s, first, published, paper, was, on, the, position, of, zeroes, of, certain, minimum, polynomials, co, authored, with, michael, fekete, and, published, when, von, neumann, was, 18, at, 19, his, solo, paper, on, the, introduction, of, transfinite, numbers, was, published, he, expanded, his, second, solo, paper, an, axiomatization, of, set, theory, to, create, his, phd, thesis, his, first, book, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, was, published, in, 1932, following, this, von, neumann, switched, from, publishing, in, german, to, publishing, in, english, and, his, publications, became, more, selective, and, expanded, beyond, pure, mathematics, his, 1942, theory, of, detonation, waves, contributed, to, military, research, his, work, on, computing, began, with, the, unpublished, 1946, on, the, principles, of, large, scale, computing, machines, and, his, publications, on, weather, prediction, began, with, the, 1950, numerical, integration, of, the, barotropic, vorticity, equation, alongside, his, later, papers, were, informal, essays, targeted, at, colleagues, and,
