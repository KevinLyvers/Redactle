christiaan, huygens, lord, of, zeelhem, frs, h, a, n, z, hy, g, nz, us, also, h, n, z, hoy, g, nz, dutch, also, spelled, huyghens, latin, hugenius, 14, april, 1629, 8, july, 1695, was, a, dutch, mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and, inventor, who, is, regarded, as, a, key, figure, in, the, scientific, revolution, in, physics, huygens, made, seminal, contributions, to, optics, and, mechanics, while, as, an, astronomer, he, studied, the, rings, of, saturn, and, discovered, its, largest, moon, titan, as, an, engineer, and, inventor, he, improved, the, design, of, telescopes, and, invented, the, pendulum, clock, the, most, accurate, timekeeper, for, almost, 300, years, a, talented, mathematician, and, physicist, his, works, contain, the, first, idealization, of, a, physical, problem, by, a, set, of, mathematical, parameters, and, the, first, mathematical, and, mechanistic, explanation, of, an, unobservable, physical, phenomenon, huygens, first, identified, the, correct, laws, of, elastic, collision, in, his, work, de, motu, corporum, ex, percussione, completed, in, 1656, but, published, posthumously, in, 1703, in, 1659, huygens, derived, geometrically, the, formula, in, classical, mechanics, for, the, centrifugal, force, in, his, work, de, vi, centrifuga, a, decade, before, newton, in, optics, he, is, best, known, for, his, wave, theory, of, light, which, he, described, in, his, trait, de, la, lumi, re, 1690, his, theory, of, light, was, initially, rejected, in, favour, of, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, of, light, until, augustin, jean, fresnel, adapted, huygens, s, principle, to, give, a, complete, explanation, of, the, rectilinear, propagation, and, diffraction, effects, of, light, in, 1821, today, this, principle, is, known, as, the, huygens, fresnel, principle, huygens, invented, the, pendulum, clock, in, 1657, which, he, patented, the, same, year, his, horological, research, resulted, in, an, extensive, analysis, of, the, pendulum, in, horologium, oscillatorium, 1673, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, 17th, century, works, on, mechanics, while, it, contains, descriptions, of, clock, designs, most, of, the, book, is, an, analysis, of, pendular, motion, and, a, theory, of, curves, in, 1655, huygens, began, grinding, lenses, with, his, brother, constantijn, to, build, refracting, telescopes, he, discovered, saturn, s, biggest, moon, titan, and, was, the, first, to, explain, saturn, s, strange, appearance, as, due, to, a, thin, flat, ring, nowhere, touching, and, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, in, 1662, huygens, developed, what, is, now, called, the, huygenian, eyepiece, a, telescope, with, two, lenses, to, diminish, the, amount, of, dispersion, as, a, mathematician, huygens, developed, the, theory, of, evolutes, and, wrote, on, games, of, chance, and, the, problem, of, points, in, van, rekeningh, in, spelen, van, gluck, which, frans, van, schooten, translated, and, published, as, de, ratiociniis, in, ludo, aleae, 1657, the, use, of, expected, values, by, huygens, and, others, would, later, inspire, jacob, bernoulli, s, work, on, probability, theory, christiaan, huygens, was, born, on, 14, april, 1629, in, the, hague, into, a, rich, and, influential, dutch, family, the, second, son, of, constantijn, huygens, christiaan, was, named, after, his, paternal, grandfather, his, mother, suzanna, van, baerle, died, shortly, after, giving, birth, to, huygens, s, sister, the, couple, had, five, children, constantijn, 1628, christiaan, 1629, lodewijk, 1631, philips, 1632, and, suzanna, 1637, constantijn, huygens, was, a, diplomat, and, advisor, to, the, house, of, orange, in, addition, to, being, a, poet, and, a, musician, he, corresponded, widely, with, intellectuals, across, europe, his, friends, included, galileo, galilei, marin, mersenne, and, ren, descartes, christiaan, was, educated, at, home, until, the, age, of, sixteen, and, from, a, young, age, liked, to, play, with, miniatures, of, mills, and, other, machines, from, his, father, he, received, a, liberal, education, studying, languages, music, history, geography, mathematics, logic, and, rhetoric, alongside, dancing, fencing, and, horse, riding, in, 1644, huygens, had, as, his, mathematical, tutor, jan, jansz, stampioen, who, assigned, the, 15, year, old, a, demanding, reading, list, on, contemporary, science, descartes, was, later, impressed, by, his, skills, in, geometry, as, was, mersenne, who, christened, him, the, new, archimedes, at, sixteen, years, of, age, constantijn, sent, huygens, to, study, law, and, mathematics, at, leiden, university, where, he, studied, from, may, 1645, to, march, 1647, frans, van, schooten, was, an, academic, at, leiden, from, 1646, and, became, a, private, tutor, to, huygens, and, his, elder, brother, constantijn, jr, replacing, stampioen, on, the, advice, of, descartes, van, schooten, brought, huygens, s, mathematical, education, up, to, date, introducing, him, to, the, work, of, vi, te, descartes, and, fermat, after, two, years, starting, in, march, 1647, huygens, continued, his, studies, at, the, newly, founded, orange, college, in, breda, where, his, father, was, a, curator, constantijn, huygens, was, closely, involved, in, the, new, college, which, lasted, only, to, 1669, the, rector, was, andr, rivet, christiaan, huygens, lived, at, the, home, of, the, jurist, johann, henryk, dauber, while, attending, college, and, had, mathematics, classes, with, the, english, lecturer, john, pell, his, time, in, breda, ended, around, the, time, when, his, brother, lodewijk, who, was, enrolled, at, the, school, duelled, with, another, student, huygens, left, breda, after, completing, his, studies, in, august, 1649, and, had, a, stint, as, a, diplomat, on, a, mission, with, henry, duke, of, nassau, it, took, him, to, bentheim, then, flensburg, he, took, off, for, denmark, visited, copenhagen, and, helsing, r, and, hoped, to, cross, the, resund, to, visit, descartes, in, stockholm, it, was, not, to, be, although, his, father, constantijn, had, wished, his, son, christiaan, to, be, a, diplomat, circumstances, kept, him, from, becoming, so, the, first, stadtholderless, period, that, began, in, 1650, meant, that, the, house, of, orange, was, no, longer, in, power, removing, constantijn, s, influence, further, he, realized, that, his, son, had, no, interest, in, such, a, career, huygens, generally, wrote, in, french, or, latin, in, 1646, while, still, a, college, student, at, leiden, he, began, a, correspondence, with, his, father, s, friend, marin, mersenne, who, died, soon, afterwards, in, 1648, mersenne, wrote, to, constantijn, on, his, son, s, talent, for, mathematics, and, flatteringly, compared, him, to, archimedes, on, 3, january, 1647, the, letters, show, huygens, s, early, interest, in, mathematics, in, october, 1646, there, is, the, suspension, bridge, and, the, demonstration, that, a, hanging, chain, is, not, a, parabola, as, galileo, thought, huygens, would, later, label, that, curve, the, catenaria, catenary, in, 1690, while, corresponding, with, gottfried, leibniz, in, the, next, two, years, 1647, 48, huygens, s, letters, to, mersenne, covered, various, topics, including, a, mathematical, proof, of, the, law, of, free, fall, the, claim, by, gr, goire, de, saint, vincent, of, circle, quadrature, which, huygens, showed, to, be, wrong, the, rectification, of, the, ellipse, projectiles, and, the, vibrating, string, some, of, mersenne, s, concerns, at, the, time, such, as, the, cycloid, he, sent, huygens, torricelli, s, treatise, on, the, curve, the, centre, of, oscillation, and, the, gravitational, constant, were, matters, huygens, only, took, seriously, later, in, the, 17th, century, mersenne, had, also, written, on, musical, theory, huygens, preferred, meantone, temperament, he, innovated, in, 31, equal, temperament, which, was, not, itself, a, new, idea, but, known, to, francisco, de, salinas, using, logarithms, to, investigate, it, further, and, show, its, close, relation, to, the, meantone, system, in, 1654, huygens, returned, to, his, father, s, house, in, the, hague, and, was, able, to, devote, himself, entirely, to, research, the, family, had, another, house, not, far, away, at, hofwijck, and, he, spent, time, there, during, the, summer, despite, being, very, active, his, scholarly, life, did, not, allow, him, to, escape, bouts, of, depression, subsequently, huygens, developed, a, broad, range, of, correspondents, though, with, some, difficulty, after, 1648, due, to, the, five, year, fronde, in, france, visiting, paris, in, 1655, huygens, called, on, ismael, boulliau, to, introduce, himself, who, took, him, to, see, claude, mylon, the, parisian, group, of, savants, that, had, gathered, around, mersenne, held, together, into, the, 1650s, and, mylon, who, had, assumed, the, secretarial, role, took, some, trouble, to, keep, huygens, in, touch, through, pierre, de, carcavi, huygens, corresponded, in, 1656, with, pierre, de, fermat, whom, he, admired, greatly, the, experience, was, bittersweet, and, somewhat, puzzling, since, it, became, clear, that, fermat, had, dropped, out, of, the, research, mainstream, and, his, priority, claims, could, probably, not, be, made, good, in, some, cases, besides, huygens, was, looking, by, then, to, apply, mathematics, to, physics, while, fermat, s, concerns, ran, to, purer, topics, like, some, of, his, contemporaries, huygens, was, often, slow, to, commit, his, results, and, discoveries, to, print, preferring, to, disseminate, his, work, through, letters, instead, in, his, early, days, his, mentor, frans, van, schooten, provided, technical, feedback, and, was, cautious, for, the, sake, of, his, reputation, between, 1651, and, 1657, huygens, published, a, number, of, works, that, showed, his, talent, for, mathematics, and, his, mastery, of, classical, and, analytical, geometry, increasing, his, reach, and, reputation, among, mathematicians, around, the, same, time, huygens, began, to, question, descartes, s, laws, of, collision, which, were, largely, wrong, deriving, the, correct, laws, algebraically, and, later, by, way, of, geometry, he, showed, that, for, any, system, of, bodies, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, system, remains, the, same, in, velocity, and, direction, which, huygens, called, the, conservation, of, quantity, of, movement, while, others, at, the, time, were, studying, impact, huygens, s, theory, of, collisions, was, more, general, these, results, became, the, main, reference, point, and, the, focus, for, further, debates, through, correspondence, and, in, a, short, article, in, journal, des, s, avans, but, would, remain, unknown, to, a, larger, audience, until, the, publication, of, de, motu, corporum, ex, percussione, concerning, the, motion, of, colliding, bodies, in, 1703, in, addition, to, his, mathematical, and, mechanical, works, huygens, made, important, scientific, discoveries, he, was, the, first, to, identify, titan, as, one, of, saturn, s, moons, in, 1655, invented, the, pendulum, clock, in, 1657, and, explained, saturn, s, strange, appearance, as, due, to, a, ring, in, 1659, all, these, discoveries, brought, him, fame, across, europe, on, 3, may, 1661, huygens, together, with, astronomer, thomas, streete, and, richard, reeve, observed, the, planet, mercury, transit, over, the, sun, using, reeve, s, telescope, in, london, streete, then, debated, the, published, record, of, hevelius, a, controversy, mediated, by, henry, oldenburg, huygens, passed, to, hevelius, a, manuscript, of, jeremiah, horrocks, on, the, transit, of, venus, in, 1639, printed, for, the, first, time, in, 1662, in, that, same, year, sir, robert, moray, sent, huygens, john, graunt, s, life, table, and, shortly, after, huygens, and, his, brother, lodewijk, dabbled, on, life, expectancy, huygens, eventually, created, the, first, graph, of, a, continuous, distribution, function, under, the, assumption, of, a, uniform, death, rate, and, used, it, to, solve, problems, in, joint, annuities, contemporaneously, huygens, who, played, the, harpsichord, took, an, interest, in, simon, stevin, s, theories, on, music, however, he, showed, very, little, concern, to, publish, his, theories, on, consonance, some, of, which, were, lost, for, centuries, for, his, contributions, to, science, the, royal, society, of, london, elected, huygens, a, fellow, in, 1663, making, him, its, first, foreign, member, when, he, was, just, 34, years, old, the, montmor, academy, started, in, the, mid, 1650s, was, the, form, the, old, mersenne, circle, took, after, his, death, huygens, took, part, in, its, debates, and, supported, those, favouring, experimental, demonstration, as, a, check, on, amateurish, attitudes, he, visited, paris, a, third, time, in, 1663, when, the, montmor, academy, closed, down, the, next, year, huygens, advocated, for, a, more, baconian, program, in, science, two, years, later, in, 1666, he, moved, to, paris, on, an, invitation, to, fill, a, leadership, position, at, king, louis, xiv, s, new, french, acad, mie, des, sciences, while, at, the, acad, mie, in, paris, huygens, had, an, important, patron, and, correspondent, in, jean, baptiste, colbert, first, minister, to, louis, xiv, however, his, relationship, with, the, french, acad, mie, was, not, always, easy, and, in, 1670, huygens, seriously, ill, chose, francis, vernon, to, carry, out, a, donation, of, his, papers, to, the, royal, society, in, london, should, he, die, however, the, aftermath, of, the, franco, dutch, war, 1672, 78, and, particularly, england, s, role, in, it, may, have, damaged, his, later, relationship, with, the, royal, society, robert, hooke, as, a, royal, society, representative, lacked, the, finesse, to, handle, the, situation, in, 1673, the, physicist, and, inventor, denis, papin, was, an, assistant, to, huygens, from, 1671, one, of, their, projects, which, did, not, bear, fruit, directly, was, the, gunpowder, engine, huygens, made, further, astronomical, observations, at, the, acad, mie, using, the, observatory, recently, completed, in, 1672, he, introduced, nicolaas, hartsoeker, to, french, scientists, such, as, nicolas, malebranche, and, giovanni, cassini, in, 1678, the, young, diplomat, leibniz, met, huygens, while, visiting, paris, in, 1672, on, a, vain, mission, to, meet, the, french, foreign, minister, arnauld, de, pomponne, leibniz, was, working, on, a, calculating, machine, at, the, time, and, after, a, short, visit, to, london, in, early, 1673, he, was, tutored, in, mathematics, by, huygens, until, 1676, an, extensive, correspondence, ensued, over, the, years, in, which, huygens, showed, at, first, reluctance, to, accept, the, advantages, of, leibniz, s, infinitesimal, calculus, huygens, moved, back, to, the, hague, in, 1681, after, suffering, another, bout, of, serious, depressive, illness, in, 1684, he, published, astroscopia, compendiaria, on, his, new, tubeless, aerial, telescope, he, attempted, to, return, to, france, in, 1685, but, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, precluded, this, move, his, father, died, in, 1687, and, he, inherited, hofwijck, which, he, made, his, home, the, following, year, on, his, third, visit, to, england, huygens, met, isaac, newton, in, person, on, 12, june, 1689, they, spoke, about, iceland, spar, and, subsequently, corresponded, about, resisted, motion, huygens, returned, to, mathematical, topics, in, his, last, years, and, observed, the, acoustical, phenomenon, now, known, as, flanging, in, 1693, two, years, later, on, 8, july, 1695, huygens, died, in, the, hague, and, was, buried, like, his, father, before, him, in, an, unmarked, grave, at, the, grote, kerk, huygens, never, married, huygens, first, became, internationally, known, for, his, work, in, mathematics, publishing, a, number, of, important, results, that, drew, the, attention, of, many, european, geometers, huygens, s, preferred, method, in, his, published, works, was, that, of, archimedes, though, he, made, use, of, descartes, s, analytic, geometry, and, fermat, s, infinitesimal, techniques, more, extensively, in, his, private, notebooks, huygens, s, first, publication, was, theoremata, de, quadratura, hyperboles, ellipsis, et, circuli, theorems, on, the, quadrature, of, the, hyperbola, ellipse, and, circle, published, by, the, elzeviers, in, leiden, in, 1651, the, first, part, of, the, work, contained, theorems, for, computing, the, areas, of, hyperbolas, ellipses, and, circles, that, paralleled, archimedes, s, work, on, conic, sections, particularly, his, quadrature, of, the, parabola, the, second, part, included, a, refutation, to, gr, goire, de, saint, vincent, s, claims, on, circle, quadrature, which, he, had, discussed, with, mersenne, earlier, huygens, demonstrated, that, the, centre, of, gravity, of, a, segment, of, any, hyperbola, ellipse, or, circle, was, directly, related, to, the, area, of, that, segment, he, was, then, able, to, show, the, relationships, between, triangles, inscribed, in, conic, sections, and, the, centre, of, gravity, for, those, sections, by, generalizing, these, theorems, to, cover, all, conic, sections, huygens, extended, classical, methods, to, generate, new, results, quadrature, was, a, live, issue, in, the, 1650s, and, through, mylon, huygens, intervened, in, the, discussion, of, the, mathematics, of, thomas, hobbes, persisting, in, trying, to, explain, the, errors, hobbes, had, fallen, into, he, made, an, international, reputation, huygens, s, next, publication, was, de, circuli, magnitudine, inventa, new, findings, in, the, measurement, of, the, circle, published, in, 1654, in, this, work, huygens, was, able, to, narrow, the, gap, between, the, circumscribed, and, inscribed, polygons, found, in, archimedes, s, measurement, of, the, circle, showing, that, the, ratio, of, the, circumference, to, its, diameter, or, must, lie, in, the, first, third, of, that, interval, using, a, technique, equivalent, to, richardson, extrapolation, huygens, was, able, to, shorten, the, inequalities, used, in, archimedes, s, method, in, this, case, by, using, the, centre, of, the, gravity, of, a, segment, of, a, parabola, he, was, able, to, approximate, the, centre, of, gravity, of, a, segment, of, a, circle, resulting, in, a, faster, and, accurate, approximation, of, the, circle, quadrature, from, these, theorems, huygens, obtained, two, set, of, values, for, the, first, between, 3, 1415926, and, 3, 1415927, and, the, second, between, 3, 1415926533, and, 3, 1415926538, huygens, also, showed, that, in, the, case, of, the, hyperbola, the, same, approximation, with, parabolic, segments, produces, a, quick, and, simple, method, to, calculate, logarithms, he, appended, a, collection, of, solutions, to, classical, problems, at, the, end, of, the, work, under, the, title, illustrium, quorundam, problematum, constructiones, construction, of, some, illustrious, problems, huygens, became, interested, in, games, of, chance, after, he, visited, paris, in, 1655, and, encountered, the, work, of, fermat, blaise, pascal, and, girard, desargues, years, earlier, he, eventually, published, what, was, at, the, time, the, most, coherent, presentation, of, a, mathematical, approach, to, games, of, chance, in, de, ratiociniis, in, ludo, aleae, on, reasoning, in, games, of, chance, frans, van, schooten, translated, the, original, dutch, manuscript, into, latin, and, published, it, in, his, exercitationum, mathematicarum, 1657, the, work, contains, early, game, theoretic, ideas, and, deals, in, particular, with, the, problem, of, points, huygens, took, from, pascal, the, concepts, of, a, fair, game, and, equitable, contract, i, e, equal, division, when, the, chances, are, equal, and, extended, the, argument, to, set, up, a, non, standard, theory, of, expected, values, his, success, in, applying, algebra, to, the, realm, of, chance, which, hitherto, seemed, inaccessible, to, mathematicians, demonstrated, the, power, of, combining, euclidean, synthetic, proofs, with, the, symbolic, reasoning, found, in, the, works, of, vi, te, and, descartes, huygens, included, five, challenging, problems, at, the, end, of, the, book, that, became, the, standard, test, for, anyone, wishing, to, display, their, mathematical, skill, in, games, of, chance, for, the, next, sixty, years, people, who, worked, on, these, problems, included, abraham, de, moivre, jacob, bernoulli, johannes, hudde, baruch, spinoza, and, leibniz, huygens, had, earlier, completed, a, manuscript, in, the, manner, of, archimedes, s, on, floating, bodies, entitled, de, iis, quae, liquido, supernatant, about, parts, floating, above, liquids, it, was, written, around, 1650, and, was, made, up, of, three, books, although, he, sent, the, completed, work, to, frans, van, schooten, for, feedback, in, the, end, huygens, chose, not, to, publish, it, and, at, one, point, suggested, it, be, burned, some, of, the, results, found, here, were, not, rediscovered, until, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, huygens, first, re, derives, archimedes, s, solutions, for, the, stability, of, the, sphere, and, the, paraboloid, by, a, clever, application, of, torricelli, s, principle, i, e, that, bodies, in, a, system, move, only, if, their, centre, of, gravity, descends, he, then, proves, the, general, theorem, that, for, a, floating, body, in, equilibrium, the, distance, between, its, centre, of, gravity, and, its, submerged, portion, is, at, a, minimum, huygens, uses, this, theorem, to, arrive, at, original, solutions, for, the, stability, of, floating, cones, parallelepipeds, and, cylinders, in, some, cases, through, a, full, cycle, of, rotation, his, approach, was, thus, equivalent, to, the, principle, of, virtual, work, huygens, was, also, the, first, to, recognize, that, for, these, homogeneous, solids, their, specific, weight, and, their, aspect, ratio, are, the, essentials, parameters, of, hydrostatic, stability, huygens, was, the, leading, european, natural, philosopher, between, descartes, and, newton, however, unlike, many, of, his, contemporaries, huygens, had, no, taste, for, grand, theoretical, or, philosophical, systems, and, generally, avoided, dealing, with, metaphysical, issues, if, pressed, he, adhered, to, the, cartesian, philosophy, of, his, time, instead, huygens, excelled, in, extending, the, work, of, his, predecessors, such, as, galileo, to, derive, solutions, to, unsolved, physical, problems, that, were, amenable, to, mathematical, analysis, in, particular, he, sought, explanations, that, relied, on, contact, between, bodies, and, avoided, action, at, a, distance, in, common, with, robert, boyle, and, jacques, rohault, huygens, advocated, an, experimentally, oriented, mechanical, natural, philosophy, during, his, paris, years, already, in, his, first, visit, to, england, in, 1661, huygens, had, learnt, about, boyle, s, air, pump, experiments, during, a, meeting, at, gresham, college, shortly, afterwards, he, reevaluated, boyle, s, experimental, design, and, developed, a, series, of, experiments, meant, to, test, a, new, hypothesis, it, proved, a, yearslong, process, that, brought, to, the, surface, a, number, of, experimental, and, theoretical, issues, and, which, ended, around, the, time, he, became, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, despite, the, replication, of, results, of, boyle, s, experiments, trailing, off, messily, huygens, came, to, accept, boyle, s, view, of, the, void, against, the, cartesian, denial, of, it, newton, s, influence, on, john, locke, was, mediated, by, huygens, who, assured, locke, that, newton, s, mathematics, was, sound, leading, to, locke, s, acceptance, of, a, corpuscular, mechanical, physics, the, general, approach, of, the, mechanical, philosophers, was, to, postulate, theories, of, the, kind, now, called, contact, action, huygens, adopted, this, method, but, not, without, seeing, its, limitations, while, leibniz, his, student, in, paris, later, abandoned, it, understanding, the, universe, this, way, made, the, theory, of, collisions, central, to, physics, as, only, explanations, that, involved, matter, in, motion, could, be, truly, intelligible, while, huygens, was, influenced, by, the, cartesian, approach, he, was, less, doctrinaire, he, studied, elastic, collisions, in, the, 1650s, but, delayed, publication, for, over, a, decade, huygens, concluded, quite, early, that, descartes, s, laws, for, elastic, collisions, were, largely, wrong, and, he, formulated, the, correct, laws, including, the, conservation, of, the, product, of, mass, times, the, square, of, the, speed, for, hard, bodies, and, the, conservation, of, quantity, of, motion, in, one, direction, for, all, bodies, an, important, step, was, his, recognition, of, the, galilean, invariance, of, the, problems, huygens, had, worked, out, the, laws, of, collision, from, 1652, to, 1656, in, a, manuscript, entitled, de, motu, corporum, ex, percussione, though, his, results, took, many, years, to, be, circulated, in, 1661, he, passed, them, on, in, person, to, william, brouncker, and, christopher, wren, in, london, what, spinoza, wrote, to, henry, oldenburg, about, them, in, 1666, during, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, was, guarded, the, war, ended, in, 1667, and, huygens, announced, his, results, to, the, royal, society, in, 1668, he, later, published, them, in, the, journal, des, s, avans, in, 1669, in, 1659, huygens, found, the, constant, of, gravitational, acceleration, and, stated, what, is, now, known, as, the, second, of, newton, s, laws, of, motion, in, quadratic, form, he, derived, geometrically, the, now, standard, formula, for, the, centrifugal, force, exerted, on, an, object, when, viewed, in, a, rotating, frame, of, reference, for, instance, when, driving, around, a, curve, in, modern, notation, with, m, the, mass, of, the, object, the, angular, velocity, and, r, the, radius, huygens, collected, his, results, in, a, treatise, under, the, title, de, vi, centrifuga, unpublished, until, 1703, where, the, kinematics, of, free, fall, were, used, to, produce, the, first, generalized, conception, of, force, prior, to, newton, the, general, idea, for, the, centrifugal, force, however, was, published, in, 1673, and, was, a, significant, step, in, studying, orbits, in, astronomy, it, enabled, the, transition, from, kepler, s, third, law, of, planetary, motion, to, the, inverse, square, law, of, gravitation, yet, the, interpretation, of, newton, s, work, on, gravitation, by, huygens, differed, from, that, of, newtonians, such, as, roger, cotes, he, did, not, insist, on, the, a, priori, attitude, of, descartes, but, neither, would, he, accept, aspects, of, gravitational, attractions, that, were, not, attributable, in, principle, to, contact, between, particles, the, approach, used, by, huygens, also, missed, some, central, notions, of, mathematical, physics, which, were, not, lost, on, others, in, his, work, on, pendulums, huygens, came, very, close, to, the, theory, of, simple, harmonic, motion, the, topic, however, was, covered, fully, for, the, first, time, by, newton, in, book, ii, of, the, principia, mathematica, 1687, in, 1678, leibniz, picked, out, of, huygens, s, work, on, collisions, the, idea, of, conservation, law, that, huygens, had, left, implicit, in, 1657, inspired, by, earlier, research, into, pendulums, as, regulating, mechanisms, huygens, invented, the, pendulum, clock, which, was, a, breakthrough, in, timekeeping, and, became, the, most, accurate, timekeeper, for, almost, 300, years, until, the, 1930s, the, pendulum, clock, was, much, more, accurate, than, the, existing, verge, and, foliot, clocks, and, was, immediately, popular, quickly, spreading, over, europe, clocks, prior, to, this, would, lose, about, 15, minutes, per, day, whereas, huygens, s, clock, would, lose, about, 15, seconds, per, day, although, huygens, patented, and, contracted, the, construction, of, his, clock, designs, to, salomon, coster, in, the, hague, he, did, not, make, much, money, from, his, invention, pierre, s, guier, refused, him, any, french, rights, while, simon, douw, in, rotterdam, and, ahasuerus, fromanteel, in, london, copied, his, design, in, 1658, the, oldest, known, huygens, style, pendulum, clock, is, dated, 1657, and, can, be, seen, at, the, museum, boerhaave, in, leiden, part, of, the, incentive, for, inventing, the, pendulum, clock, was, to, create, an, accurate, marine, chronometer, that, could, be, used, to, find, longitude, by, celestial, navigation, during, sea, voyages, however, the, clock, proved, unsuccessful, as, a, marine, timekeeper, because, the, rocking, motion, of, the, ship, disturbed, the, motion, of, the, pendulum, in, 1660, lodewijk, huygens, made, a, trial, on, a, voyage, to, spain, and, reported, that, heavy, weather, made, the, clock, useless, alexander, bruce, entered, the, field, in, 1662, and, huygens, called, in, sir, robert, moray, and, the, royal, society, to, mediate, and, preserve, some, of, his, rights, trials, continued, into, the, 1660s, the, best, news, coming, from, a, royal, navy, captain, robert, holmes, operating, against, the, dutch, possessions, in, 1664, lisa, jardine, doubts, that, holmes, reported, the, results, of, the, trial, accurately, as, samuel, pepys, expressed, his, doubts, at, the, time, a, trial, for, the, french, academy, on, an, expedition, to, cayenne, ended, badly, jean, richer, suggested, correction, for, the, figure, of, the, earth, by, the, time, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, expedition, of, 1686, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, huygens, was, able, to, supply, the, correction, retrospectively, sixteen, years, after, the, invention, of, the, pendulum, clock, in, 1673, huygens, published, his, major, work, on, horology, entitled, horologium, oscillatorium, sive, de, motu, pendulorum, ad, horologia, aptato, demonstrationes, geometricae, the, pendulum, clock, or, geometrical, demonstrations, concerning, the, motion, of, pendula, as, applied, to, clocks, it, is, the, first, modern, work, on, mechanics, where, a, physical, problem, is, idealized, by, a, set, of, parameters, then, analysed, mathematically, huygens, s, motivation, came, from, the, observation, made, by, mersenne, and, others, that, pendulums, are, not, quite, isochronous, their, period, depends, on, their, width, of, swing, with, wide, swings, taking, slightly, longer, than, narrow, swings, he, tackled, this, problem, by, finding, the, curve, down, which, a, mass, will, slide, under, the, influence, of, gravity, in, the, same, amount, of, time, regardless, of, its, starting, point, the, so, called, tautochrone, problem, by, geometrical, methods, which, anticipated, the, calculus, huygens, showed, it, to, be, a, cycloid, rather, than, the, circular, arc, of, a, pendulum, s, bob, and, therefore, that, pendulums, needed, to, move, on, a, cycloid, path, in, order, to, be, isochronous, the, mathematics, necessary, to, solve, this, problem, led, huygens, to, develop, his, theory, of, evolutes, which, he, presented, in, part, iii, of, his, horologium, oscillatorium, he, also, solved, a, problem, posed, by, mersenne, earlier, how, to, calculate, the, period, of, a, pendulum, made, of, an, arbitrarily, shaped, swinging, rigid, body, this, involved, discovering, the, centre, of, oscillation, and, its, reciprocal, relationship, with, the, pivot, point, in, the, same, work, he, analysed, the, conical, pendulum, consisting, of, a, weight, on, a, cord, moving, in, a, circle, using, the, concept, of, centrifugal, force, huygens, was, the, first, to, derive, the, formula, for, the, period, of, an, ideal, mathematical, pendulum, with, mass, less, rod, or, cord, and, length, much, longer, than, its, swing, in, modern, notation, with, t, the, period, l, the, length, of, the, pendulum, and, g, the, gravitational, acceleration, by, his, study, of, the, oscillation, period, of, compound, pendulums, huygens, made, pivotal, contributions, to, the, development, of, the, concept, of, moment, of, inertia, huygens, also, observed, coupled, oscillations, two, of, his, pendulum, clocks, mounted, next, to, each, other, on, the, same, support, often, became, synchronized, swinging, in, opposite, directions, he, reported, the, results, by, letter, to, the, royal, society, and, it, is, referred, to, as, an, odd, kind, of, sympathy, in, the, society, s, minutes, this, concept, is, now, known, as, entrainment, in, 1675, while, investigating, the, oscillating, properties, of, the, cycloid, huygens, was, able, to, transform, a, cycloidal, pendulum, into, a, vibrating, spring, through, a, combination, of, geometry, and, higher, mathematics, in, the, same, year, huygens, designed, a, spiral, balance, spring, and, patented, a, pocket, watch, these, watches, are, notable, for, lacking, a, fusee, for, equalizing, the, mainspring, torque, the, implication, is, that, huygens, thought, his, spiral, spring, would, isochronize, the, balance, in, the, same, way, that, cycloid, shaped, suspension, curbs, on, his, clocks, would, isochronize, the, pendulum, he, later, used, spiral, springs, in, more, conventional, watches, made, for, him, by, thuret, in, paris, such, springs, are, essential, in, modern, watches, with, a, detached, lever, escapement, because, they, can, be, adjusted, for, isochronism, watches, in, huygens, s, time, however, employed, the, very, ineffective, verge, escapement, which, interfered, with, the, isochronal, properties, of, any, form, of, balance, spring, spiral, or, otherwise, huygens, s, design, came, around, the, same, time, as, though, independently, of, robert, hooke, s, controversy, over, the, priority, of, the, balance, spring, persisted, for, centuries, in, february, 2006, a, long, lost, copy, of, hooke, s, handwritten, notes, from, several, decades, of, royal, society, meetings, was, discovered, in, a, cupboard, in, hampshire, england, presumably, tipping, the, evidence, in, hooke, s, favour, huygens, had, a, long, term, interest, in, the, study, of, light, refraction, and, lenses, or, dioptrics, from, 1652, date, the, first, drafts, of, a, latin, treatise, on, the, theory, of, dioptrics, known, as, the, tractatus, which, contained, a, comprehensive, and, rigorous, theory, of, the, telescope, huygens, was, one, of, the, few, to, raise, theoretical, questions, regarding, the, properties, and, working, of, the, telescope, and, almost, the, only, one, to, direct, his, mathematical, proficiency, towards, the, actual, instruments, used, in, astronomy, huygens, repeatedly, announced, its, publication, to, his, colleagues, but, ultimately, postponed, it, in, favor, of, a, much, more, comprehensive, treatment, now, under, the, name, of, the, dioptrica, it, consisted, of, three, parts, the, first, part, focused, on, the, general, principles, of, refraction, the, second, dealt, with, spherical, and, chromatic, aberration, while, the, third, covered, all, aspects, of, the, construction, of, telescopes, and, microscopes, in, contrast, to, descartes, dioptrics, which, treated, only, ideal, elliptical, and, hyperbolical, lenses, huygens, dealt, exclusively, with, spherical, lenses, which, were, the, only, kind, that, could, really, be, made, and, incorporated, in, devices, such, as, microscopes, and, telescopes, huygens, also, worked, out, practical, ways, to, minimize, the, effects, of, spherical, and, chromatic, aberration, such, as, long, focal, distances, for, the, objective, of, a, telescope, internal, stops, to, reduce, the, aperture, and, a, new, kind, of, ocular, known, as, the, huygenian, eyepiece, the, dioptrica, was, never, published, in, huygens, s, lifetime, and, only, appeared, in, press, in, 1703, when, most, of, its, contents, were, already, familiar, to, the, scientific, world, together, with, his, brother, constantijn, huygens, began, grinding, his, own, lenses, in, 1655, in, an, effort, to, improve, telescopes, he, designed, in, 1662, what, is, now, called, the, huygenian, eyepiece, a, set, of, two, planoconvex, lenses, used, as, a, telescope, ocular, huygens, s, lenses, were, known, to, be, of, superb, quality, and, polished, consistently, according, to, his, specifications, however, his, telescopes, did, not, produce, very, sharp, images, leading, some, to, speculate, that, he, might, have, suffered, from, near, sightedness, lenses, were, also, a, common, interest, through, which, huygens, could, meet, socially, in, the, 1660s, with, spinoza, who, ground, them, professionally, they, had, rather, different, outlooks, on, science, spinoza, being, the, more, committed, cartesian, and, some, of, their, discussion, survives, in, correspondence, he, encountered, the, work, of, antoni, van, leeuwenhoek, another, lens, grinder, in, the, field, of, microscopy, which, interested, his, father, huygens, also, investigated, the, use, of, lenses, in, projectors, he, is, credited, as, the, inventor, of, the, magic, lantern, described, in, correspondence, of, 1659, there, are, others, to, whom, such, a, lantern, device, has, been, attributed, such, as, giambattista, della, porta, and, cornelis, drebbel, though, huygens, s, design, used, lens, for, better, projection, athanasius, kircher, has, also, been, credited, for, that, huygens, is, especially, remembered, in, optics, for, his, wave, theory, of, light, which, he, first, communicated, in, 1678, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, paris, originally, a, preliminary, chapter, of, his, dioptrica, huygens, s, theory, was, published, in, 1690, under, the, title, trait, de, la, lumi, re, treatise, on, light, and, contains, the, first, fully, mathematized, mechanistic, explanation, of, an, unobservable, physical, phenomenon, i, e, light, propagation, huygens, refers, to, ignace, gaston, pardies, whose, manuscript, on, optics, helped, him, on, his, wave, theory, the, challenge, at, the, time, was, to, explain, geometrical, optics, as, most, physical, optics, phenomena, such, as, diffraction, had, not, been, observed, or, appreciated, as, issues, huygens, had, experimented, in, 1672, with, double, refraction, birefringence, in, the, iceland, spar, a, calcite, a, phenomenon, discovered, in, 1669, by, rasmus, bartholin, at, first, he, could, not, elucidate, what, he, found, but, was, later, able, to, explain, it, using, his, wavefront, theory, and, concept, of, evolutes, he, also, developed, ideas, on, caustics, huygens, assumes, that, the, speed, of, light, is, finite, based, on, a, report, by, ole, christensen, r, mer, in, 1677, but, which, huygens, is, presumed, to, have, already, believed, huygens, s, theory, posits, light, as, radiating, wavefronts, with, the, common, notion, of, light, rays, depicting, propagation, normal, to, those, wavefronts, propagation, of, the, wavefronts, is, then, explained, as, the, result, of, spherical, waves, being, emitted, at, every, point, along, the, wave, front, known, today, as, the, huygens, fresnel, principle, it, assumed, an, omnipresent, ether, with, transmission, through, perfectly, elastic, particles, a, revision, of, the, view, of, descartes, the, nature, of, light, was, therefore, a, longitudinal, wave, his, theory, of, light, was, not, widely, accepted, while, newton, s, rival, corpuscular, theory, of, light, as, found, in, his, opticks, 1704, gained, more, support, one, strong, objection, to, huygens, s, theory, was, that, longitudinal, waves, have, only, a, single, polarization, which, cannot, explain, the, observed, birefringence, however, thomas, young, s, interference, experiments, in, 1801, and, fran, ois, arago, s, detection, of, the, poisson, spot, in, 1819, could, not, be, explained, through, newton, s, or, any, other, particle, theory, reviving, huygens, s, ideas, and, wave, models, fresnel, became, aware, of, huygens, s, work, and, in, 1821, was, able, to, explain, birefringence, as, a, result, of, light, being, not, a, longitudinal, as, had, been, assumed, but, actually, a, transverse, wave, the, thus, named, huygens, fresnel, principle, was, the, basis, for, the, advancement, of, physical, optics, explaining, all, aspects, of, light, propagation, until, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, theory, culminated, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, and, the, discovery, of, the, photon, in, 1655, huygens, discovered, the, first, of, saturn, s, moons, titan, and, observed, and, sketched, the, orion, nebula, using, a, refracting, telescope, with, a, 43x, magnification, of, his, own, design, huygens, succeeded, in, subdividing, the, nebula, into, different, stars, the, brighter, interior, now, bears, the, name, of, the, huygenian, region, in, his, honour, and, discovered, several, interstellar, nebulae, and, some, double, stars, he, was, also, the, first, to, propose, that, the, appearance, of, saturn, which, had, baffled, astronomers, was, due, to, a, thin, flat, ring, nowhere, touching, and, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, more, than, three, years, later, in, 1659, huygens, published, his, theory, and, findings, in, systema, saturnium, it, is, considered, the, most, important, work, on, telescopic, astronomy, since, galileo, s, sidereus, nuncius, fifty, years, earlier, much, more, than, a, report, on, saturn, huygens, provided, measurements, for, the, relative, distances, of, the, planets, from, the, sun, introduced, the, concept, of, the, micrometer, and, showed, a, method, to, measure, angular, diameters, of, planets, which, finally, allowed, the, telescope, to, be, used, as, an, instrument, to, measure, rather, than, just, sighting, astronomical, objects, he, was, also, the, first, to, question, the, authority, of, galileo, in, telescopic, matters, a, sentiment, that, was, to, be, common, in, the, years, following, its, publication, in, the, same, year, huygens, was, able, to, observe, syrtis, major, a, volcanic, plain, on, mars, he, used, repeated, observations, of, the, movement, of, this, feature, over, the, course, of, a, number, of, days, to, estimate, the, length, of, day, on, mars, which, he, did, quite, accurately, to, 24, 1, 2, hours, this, figure, is, only, a, few, minutes, off, of, the, actual, length, of, the, martian, day, of, 24, hours, 37, minutes, at, the, instigation, of, jean, baptiste, colbert, huygens, undertook, the, task, of, constructing, a, mechanical, planetarium, that, could, display, all, the, planets, and, their, moons, then, known, circling, around, the, sun, huygens, completed, his, design, in, 1680, and, had, his, clockmaker, johannes, van, ceulen, built, it, the, following, year, however, colbert, passed, away, in, the, interim, and, huygens, never, got, to, deliver, his, planetarium, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, as, the, new, minister, fran, ois, michel, le, tellier, decided, not, to, renew, huygens, s, contract, in, his, design, huygens, made, an, ingenious, use, of, continued, fractions, to, find, the, best, rational, approximations, by, which, he, could, choose, the, gears, with, the, correct, number, of, teeth, the, ratio, between, two, gears, determined, the, orbital, periods, of, two, planets, to, move, the, planets, around, the, sun, huygens, used, a, clock, mechanism, that, could, go, forwards, and, backwards, in, time, huygens, claimed, his, planetarium, was, more, accurate, that, a, similar, device, constructed, by, ole, r, mer, around, the, same, time, but, his, planetarium, design, was, not, published, until, after, his, death, in, the, opuscula, posthuma, 1703, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1695, huygens, completed, his, most, speculative, work, entitled, cosmotheoros, at, his, direction, it, was, to, be, published, only, posthumously, by, his, brother, which, constantijn, jr, did, in, 1698, in, this, work, huygens, speculated, on, the, existence, of, extraterrestrial, life, which, he, imagined, similar, to, that, on, earth, such, speculations, were, not, uncommon, at, the, time, justified, by, copernicanism, or, the, plenitude, principle, but, huygens, went, into, greater, detail, however, it, did, so, without, the, benefit, of, understanding, newton, s, laws, of, gravitation, or, the, fact, that, the, atmospheres, on, other, planets, are, composed, of, different, gases, cosmotheoros, translated, into, english, as, the, celestial, worlds, discover, d, has, been, seen, as, part, of, speculative, fiction, in, the, tradition, of, francis, godwin, john, wilkins, and, cyrano, de, bergerac, huygens, s, work, was, fundamentally, utopian, and, owes, some, inspiration, from, the, cosmography, and, planetary, speculation, of, peter, heylin, huygens, wrote, that, availability, of, water, in, liquid, form, was, essential, for, life, and, that, the, properties, of, water, must, vary, from, planet, to, planet, to, suit, the, temperature, range, he, took, his, observations, of, dark, and, bright, spots, on, the, surfaces, of, mars, and, jupiter, to, be, evidence, of, water, and, ice, on, those, planets, he, argued, that, extraterrestrial, life, is, neither, confirmed, nor, denied, by, the, bible, and, questioned, why, god, would, create, the, other, planets, if, they, were, not, to, serve, a, greater, purpose, than, that, of, being, admired, from, earth, huygens, postulated, that, the, great, distance, between, the, planets, signified, that, god, had, not, intended, for, beings, on, one, to, know, about, the, beings, on, the, others, and, had, not, foreseen, how, much, humans, would, advance, in, scientific, knowledge, it, was, also, in, this, book, that, huygens, published, his, estimates, for, the, relative, sizes, of, the, solar, system, and, his, method, for, calculating, stellar, distances, he, made, a, series, of, smaller, holes, in, a, screen, facing, the, sun, until, he, estimated, the, light, was, of, the, same, intensity, as, that, of, the, star, sirius, he, then, calculated, that, the, angle, of, this, hole, was, 1, 27, 664th, the, diameter, of, the, sun, and, thus, it, was, about, 30, 000, times, as, far, away, on, the, incorrect, assumption, that, sirius, is, as, luminous, as, the, sun, the, subject, of, photometry, remained, in, its, infancy, until, the, time, of, pierre, bouguer, and, johann, heinrich, lambert, huygens, has, been, called, the, first, theoretical, physicist, and, a, founder, of, modern, mathematical, physics, although, his, influence, was, considerable, during, his, lifetime, it, began, to, fade, shortly, after, his, death, his, skills, as, a, geometer, and, mechanical, ingenuity, elicited, the, admiration, of, many, of, his, contemporaries, including, newton, leibniz, l, h, pital, and, the, bernoullis, for, his, work, in, physics, huygens, has, been, deemed, one, of, the, greatest, scientists, in, the, scientific, revolution, rivaled, only, by, newton, in, both, depth, of, insight, and, the, number, of, results, obtained, huygens, also, helped, develop, the, institutional, frameworks, for, scientific, research, on, the, european, continent, making, him, a, leading, actor, in, the, establishment, of, modern, science, in, mathematics, huygens, mastered, the, methods, of, ancient, greek, geometry, particularly, the, work, of, archimedes, and, was, an, adept, user, of, the, analytic, geometry, and, infinitesimal, techniques, of, descartes, and, fermat, his, mathematical, style, can, be, best, described, as, geometrical, infinitesimal, analysis, of, curves, and, of, motion, drawing, inspiration, and, imagery, from, mechanics, it, remained, pure, mathematics, in, form, huygens, brought, this, type, of, geometrical, analysis, to, a, close, as, more, mathematicians, turned, away, from, classical, geometry, to, the, calculus, for, handling, infinitesimals, limit, processes, and, motion, huygens, was, moreover, able, to, fully, employ, mathematics, to, answer, questions, of, physics, often, this, entailed, introducing, a, simple, model, for, describing, a, complicated, situation, then, analyzing, it, starting, from, simple, arguments, to, their, logical, consequences, developing, the, necessary, mathematics, along, the, way, as, he, wrote, at, the, end, of, a, draft, of, de, vi, centrifuga, whatever, you, will, have, supposed, not, impossible, either, concerning, gravity, or, motion, or, any, other, matter, if, then, you, prove, something, concerning, the, magnitude, of, a, line, surface, or, body, it, will, be, true, as, for, instance, archimedes, on, the, quadrature, of, the, parabola, where, the, tendency, of, heavy, objects, has, been, assumed, to, act, through, parallel, lines, huygens, favoured, axiomatic, presentations, of, his, results, which, require, rigorous, methods, of, geometric, demonstration, although, he, allowed, levels, of, uncertainty, in, the, selection, of, primary, axioms, and, hypotheses, the, proofs, of, theorems, derived, from, these, could, never, be, in, doubt, huygens, s, style, of, publication, exerted, an, influence, in, newton, s, presentation, of, his, own, major, works, besides, the, application, of, mathematics, to, physics, and, physics, to, mathematics, huygens, relied, on, mathematics, as, methodology, specifically, its, ability, to, generate, new, knowledge, about, the, world, unlike, galileo, who, used, mathematics, primarily, as, rhetoric, or, synthesis, huygens, consistently, employed, mathematics, as, a, way, to, discover, and, develop, theories, covering, various, phenomena, and, insisted, that, the, reduction, of, the, physical, to, the, geometrical, satisfy, exacting, standards, of, fit, between, the, real, and, the, ideal, in, demanding, such, mathematical, tractability, and, precision, huygens, set, an, example, for, eighteenth, century, scientists, such, as, johann, bernoulli, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, although, never, intended, for, publication, huygens, made, use, of, algebraic, expressions, to, represent, physical, entities, in, a, handful, of, his, manuscripts, on, collisions, this, would, make, him, one, of, the, first, to, employ, mathematical, formulae, to, describe, relationships, in, physics, as, it, is, done, today, huygens, also, came, close, to, the, modern, idea, of, limit, while, working, on, his, dioptrica, though, he, never, used, the, notion, outside, geometrical, optics, huygens, s, standing, as, the, greatest, scientist, in, europe, was, eclipsed, by, newton, s, at, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, despite, the, fact, that, as, hugh, aldersey, williams, notes, huygens, s, achievement, exceeds, that, of, newton, in, some, important, respects, although, his, journal, publications, anticipated, the, form, of, the, modern, scientific, article, his, persistent, classicism, and, reluctance, to, publish, his, work, did, much, to, diminish, his, influence, in, the, aftermath, of, the, scientific, revolution, as, adherents, of, leibniz, calculus, and, newton, s, physics, took, centre, stage, huygens, s, analyses, of, curves, that, satisfy, certain, physical, properties, such, as, the, cycloid, led, to, later, studies, of, many, other, such, curves, like, the, caustic, the, brachistochrone, the, sail, curve, and, the, catenary, his, application, of, mathematics, to, physics, such, as, in, his, studies, of, impact, and, birefringence, would, inspire, new, developments, in, mathematical, physics, and, rational, mechanics, in, the, following, centuries, albeit, in, the, new, language, of, the, calculus, additionally, huygens, developed, the, oscillating, timekeeping, mechanisms, the, pendulum, and, the, balance, spring, that, have, been, used, ever, since, in, mechanical, watches, and, clocks, these, were, the, first, reliable, timekeepers, fit, for, scientific, use, e, g, to, make, accurate, measurements, of, the, inequality, of, the, solar, day, which, was, not, possible, before, his, work, in, this, area, foreshadowed, the, union, of, applied, mathematics, with, mechanical, engineering, in, the, centuries, that, followed, during, his, lifetime, huygens, and, his, father, had, a, number, of, portraits, commissioned, these, included, the, european, space, agency, spacecraft, that, landed, on, titan, saturn, s, largest, moon, in, 2005, was, named, after, him, a, number, of, monuments, to, christiaan, huygens, can, be, found, across, important, cities, in, the, netherlands, including, rotterdam, delft, and, leiden, source, s
