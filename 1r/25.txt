insect, play, gielgud, later, said, that, he, made, a, poor, impression, in, the, part, i, am, surprised, that, the, audience, did, not, throw, things, at, me, the, critics, were, cautious, but, not, hostile, to, the, play, it, did, not, attract, the, public, and, closed, after, a, month, while, still, continuing, his, studies, at, rada, gielgud, appeared, again, for, playfair, in, robert, e, lee,

he, played, a, wide, range, of, parts, in, classics, and, modern, plays, greatly, increasing, his, technical, abilities, in, the, process, the, role, he, most, enjoyed, was, trofimov, in, the, cherry, orchard, his, first, experience, of, chekhov, it, was, the, first, time, i, ever, went, out, on, stage, feeling, that, perhaps, after, all, i, could, really, be, an, actor, between, gielgud, s, first, two, oxford, seasons, the, producer, barry, jackson, cast, him, as, romeo, to, the, juliet, of, gwen, ffrangcon, davies, at, the, regent, s, theatre, london, in, may, 1924, the, production, was, not, a, great, success, but, the, two, performers, became, close, friends, and, frequently, worked, together, throughout, their, careers, gielgud, made, his, screen, debut, during, 1924, as, daniel, arnault, in, walter, summers, s, silent, film, who, is, the, man, 1924, in, may, 1925, the, oxford, production, of, the, cherry, orchard, was, brought, to, the, lyric, theatre, hammersmith, gielgud, again, played, trofimov, his, distinctive, speaking, voice, attracted, attention, and, led, to, work, for, bbc, radio, which, his, biographer, sheridan, morley, calls, a, medium, he, made, his, own, for, seventy, years, in, the, same, year, no, l, coward, chose, gielgud, as, his, understudy, in, his, play, the, vortex, for, the, last, month, of, the, west, end, run, gielgud, took, over, coward, s, role, of, nicky, lancaster, the, drug, addicted, son, of, a, nymphomaniac, mother, it, was, in, gielgud, s, words, a, highly, strung, nervous, hysterical, part, which, depended, a, lot, upon, emotion, he, found, it, tiring, to, play, because, he, had, not, yet, learned, how, to, pace, himself, but, he, thought, it, a, thrilling, engagement, because, it, led, to, so, many, great, things, afterwards, the, success, of, the, cherry, orchard, led, to, what, one, critic, called, a, chekhov, boom, in, british, theatres, and, gielgud, was, among, its, leading, players, as, konstantin, in, the, seagull, in, october, 1925, he, impressed, the, russian, director, theodore, komisarjevsky, who, cast, him, as, tusenbach, in, the, british, premiere, of, three, sisters, the, production, received, enthusiastic, reviews, and, gielgud, s, highly, praised, performance, enhanced, his, reputation, as, a, potential, star, there, followed, three, years, of, mixed, fortunes, for, him, with, successes, in, fringe, productions, but, west, end, stardom, was, elusive, in, 1926, the, producer, basil, dean, offered, gielgud, the, lead, role, lewis, dodd, in, a, dramatisation, of, margaret, kennedy, s, best, selling, novel, the, constant, nymph, before, rehearsals, began, dean, found, that, a, bigger, star, than, gielgud, was, available, namely, coward, to, whom, he, gave, the, part, gielgud, had, an, enforceable, contractual, claim, to, the, role, but, dean, a, notorious, bully, was, a, powerful, force, in, british, theatre, intimidated, gielgud, accepted, the, position, of, understudy, with, a, guarantee, that, he, would, take, over, the, lead, from, coward, when, the, latter, who, disliked, playing, in, long, runs, left, in, the, event, coward, who, had, been, overworking, suffered, a, nervous, collapse, three, weeks, after, the, opening, night, and, gielgud, played, the, lead, for, the, rest, of, the, run, the, play, ran, for, nearly, a, year, in, london, and, then, went, on, tour, by, this, time, gielgud, was, earning, enough, to, leave, the, family, home, and, take, a, small, flat, in, the, west, end, he, had, his, first, serious, romantic, relationship, living, with, john, perry, an, unsuccessful, actor, later, a, writer, who, remained, a, lifelong, friend, after, their, affair, ended, morley, makes, the, point, that, like, coward, gielgud, s, principal, passion, was, the, stage, both, men, had, casual, dalliances, but, were, more, comfortable, with, low, maintenance, long, term, partners, who, did, not, impede, their, theatrical, work, and, ambitions, in, 1928, gielgud, made, his, broadway, debut, as, the, grand, duke, alexander, in, alfred, neumann, s, the, patriot, the, play, was, a, failure, closing, after, a, week, but, gielgud, liked, new, york, and, received, favourable, reviews, from, critics, including, alexander, woollcott, and, brooks, atkinson, after, returning, to, london, he, starred, in, a, succession, of, short, runs, including, ibsen, s, ghosts, with, mrs, patrick, campbell, 1928, and, reginald, berkeley, s, the, lady, with, a, lamp, 1929, with, edith, evans, and, gwen, ffrangcon, davies, in, 1928, he, made, his, second, film, the, clue, of, the, new, pin, this, billed, as, the, first, british, full, length, talkie, was, an, adaptation, of, an, edgar, wallace, mystery, story, gielgud, played, a, young, scoundrel, who, commits, two, murders, and, very, nearly, a, third, before, he, himself, is, killed, in, 1929, harcourt, williams, newly, appointed, as, director, of, productions, at, the, old, vic, invited, gielgud, to, join, the, company, for, the, forthcoming, season, the, old, vic, in, an, unfashionable, area, of, london, south, of, the, thames, was, run, by, lilian, baylis, to, offer, plays, and, operas, to, a, mostly, working, class, audience, at, low, ticket, prices, she, paid, her, performers, very, modest, wages, but, the, theatre, was, known, for, its, unrivalled, repertory, of, classics, mostly, shakespeare, and, gielgud, was, not, the, first, west, end, star, to, take, a, large, pay, cut, to, work, there, it, was, in, morley, s, words, the, place, to, learn, shakespearean, technique, and, try, new, ideas, during, his, first, season, at, the, old, vic, gielgud, played, romeo, to, the, juliet, of, adele, dixon, antonio, in, the, merchant, of, venice, cleante, in, the, imaginary, invalid, the, title, role, in, richard, ii, and, oberon, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, his, romeo, was, not, well, reviewed, but, as, richard, ii, gielgud, was, recognised, by, critics, as, a, shakespearean, actor, of, undoubted, authority, the, reviewer, in, the, times, commented, on, his, sensitiveness, strength, and, firmness, and, called, his, performance, work, of, genuine, distinction, not, only, in, its, grasp, of, character, but, in, its, control, of, language, later, in, the, season, he, was, cast, as, mark, antony, in, julius, caesar, orlando, in, as, you, like, it, the, emperor, in, androcles, and, the, lion, and, the, title, role, in, pirandello, s, the, man, with, the, flower, in, his, mouth, in, april, 1930, gielgud, finished, the, season, playing, hamlet, williams, s, production, used, the, complete, text, of, the, play, this, was, regarded, as, a, radical, innovation, extensive, cuts, had, been, customary, for, earlier, productions, a, running, time, of, nearly, five, hours, did, not, dampen, the, enthusiasm, of, the, public, the, critics, or, the, acting, profession, sybil, thorndike, said, i, never, hoped, to, see, hamlet, played, as, in, one, s, dreams, i, ve, had, an, evening, of, being, swept, right, off, my, feet, into, another, life, far, more, real, than, the, life, i, live, in, and, moved, moved, beyond, words, the, production, gained, such, a, reputation, that, the, old, vic, began, to, attract, large, numbers, of, west, end, theatregoers, demand, was, so, great, that, the, cast, moved, to, the, queen, s, theatre, in, shaftesbury, avenue, where, williams, staged, the, piece, with, the, text, discreetly, shortened, the, effect, of, the, cuts, was, to, give, the, title, role, even, more, prominence, gielgud, s, hamlet, was, richly, praised, by, the, critics, ivor, brown, called, it, a, tremendous, performance, the, best, hamlet, of, experience, james, agate, wrote, i, have, no, hesitation, whatsoever, in, saying, that, it, is, the, high, water, mark, of, english, shakespearean, acting, of, our, time, hamlet, was, a, role, with, which, gielgud, was, associated, over, the, next, decade, and, more, after, the, run, at, the, queen, s, finished, he, turned, to, another, part, for, which, he, became, well, known, john, worthing, in, the, importance, of, being, earnest, gielgud, s, biographer, jonathan, croall, comments, that, the, two, roles, illustrated, two, sides, of, the, actor, s, personality, on, the, one, hand, the, romantic, and, soulful, hamlet, and, on, the, other, the, witty, and, superficial, worthing, the, formidable, lady, bracknell, was, played, by, his, aunt, mabel, terry, lewis, the, times, observed, mr, gielgud, and, miss, terry, lewis, together, are, brilliant, they, have, the, supreme, grace, of, always, allowing, wilde, to, speak, in, his, own, voice, returning, to, the, old, vic, for, the, 1930, 31, season, gielgud, found, several, changes, to, the, company, donald, wolfit, who, loathed, him, and, was, himself, disliked, by, his, colleagues, was, dropped, as, was, adele, dixon, gielgud, was, uncertain, of, the, suitability, of, the, most, prominent, new, recruit, ralph, richardson, but, williams, was, sure, that, after, this, season, gielgud, would, move, on, he, saw, richardson, as, a, potential, replacement, the, two, actors, had, little, in, common, richardson, recalled, he, was, a, kind, of, brilliant, butterfly, while, i, was, a, very, gloomy, sort, of, boy, and, i, found, his, clothes, extravagant, i, found, his, conversation, flippant, he, was, the, new, young, man, of, his, time, and, i, didn, t, like, him, the, first, production, of, the, season, was, henry, iv, part, 1, in, which, gielgud, as, hotspur, had, the, best, of, the, reviews, richardson, s, notices, and, the, relationship, of, the, two, leading, men, improved, markedly, when, gielgud, who, was, playing, prospero, in, the, tempest, helped, richardson, with, his, performance, as, caliban, he, gave, me, about, two, hundred, ideas, as, he, usually, does, twenty, five, of, which, i, eagerly, seized, on, and, when, i, went, away, i, thought, this, chap, you, know, i, don, t, like, him, very, much, but, by, god, he, knows, something, about, this, here, play, and, then, out, of, that, we, formed, a, friendship, the, friendship, and, professional, association, lasted, for, more, than, fifty, years, until, the, end, of, richardson, s, life, gielgud, s, other, roles, in, this, season, were, lord, trinket, in, the, jealous, wife, richard, ii, again, antony, in, antony, and, cleopatra, malvolio, in, twelfth, night, sergius, in, arms, and, the, man, benedick, in, much, ado, about, nothing, another, role, for, which, he, became, celebrated, and, he, concluded, the, season, as, king, lear, his, performance, divided, opinion, the, times, commented, it, is, a, mountain, of, a, part, and, at, the, end, of, the, evening, the, peak, remains, unscaled, in, the, manchester, guardian, however, brown, wrote, that, gielgud, is, a, match, for, the, thunder, and, at, length, takes, the, dover, road, with, a, broken, tranquillity, that, allowed, every, word, of, the, king, s, agony, to, be, clear, as, well, as, poignant, returning, to, the, west, end, gielgud, starred, in, j, b, priestley, s, the, good, companions, adapted, for, the, stage, by, the, author, and, edward, knoblock, the, production, ran, from, may, 1931, for, 331, performances, and, gielgud, described, it, as, his, first, real, taste, of, commercial, success, he, played, inigo, jollifant, a, young, schoolmaster, who, abandons, teaching, to, join, a, travelling, theatre, troupe, this, crowd, pleaser, drew, disapproval, from, the, more, austere, reviewers, who, felt, gielgud, should, be, doing, something, more, demanding, but, he, found, playing, a, conventional, juvenile, lead, had, challenges, of, its, own, and, helped, him, improve, his, technique, during, the, run, of, the, play, he, made, another, film, insult, 1932, a, melodrama, about, the, french, foreign, legion, and, he, starred, in, a, cinema, version, of, the, good, companions, in, 1933, with, jessie, matthews, a, letter, to, a, friend, reveals, gielgud, s, view, of, film, acting, there, is, talk, of, my, doing, inigo, in, the, film, of, the, good, companions, which, appals, my, soul, but, appeals, to, my, pocket, in, his, first, volume, of, memoirs, published, in, 1939, gielgud, devoted, two, pages, to, describing, the, things, about, filming, that, he, detested, unlike, his, contemporaries, richardson, and, laurence, olivier, he, made, few, films, until, after, the, second, world, war, and, did, not, establish, himself, as, a, prominent, film, actor, until, many, years, after, that, as, he, put, it, in, 1994, i, was, stupid, enough, to, toss, my, head, and, stick, to, the, stage, while, watching, larry, and, ralph, sign, lucrative, korda, contracts, in, 1932, gielgud, turned, to, directing, at, the, invitation, of, george, devine, the, president, of, the, oxford, university, dramatic, society, gielgud, took, charge, of, a, production, of, romeo, and, juliet, by, the, society, featuring, two, guest, stars, peggy, ashcroft, as, juliet, and, edith, evans, as, the, nurse, the, rest, of, the, cast, were, students, led, by, christopher, hassall, as, romeo, and, included, devine, william, devlin, and, terence, rattigan, the, experience, was, satisfactory, to, gielgud, he, enjoyed, the, attentions, of, the, undergraduates, had, a, brief, affair, with, one, of, them, james, lees, milne, and, was, widely, praised, for, his, inspiring, direction, and, his, prot, g, s, success, with, the, play, already, notorious, for, his, innocent, slips, of, the, tongue, he, called, them, gielgoofs, in, a, speech, after, the, final, performance, he, referred, to, ashcroft, and, evans, as, two, leading, ladies, the, like, of, whom, i, hope, i, shall, never, meet, again, during, the, rest, of, 1932, gielgud, played, in, a, new, piece, musical, chairs, by, ronald, mackenzie, and, directed, one, new, and, one,

he, starred, in, richard, of, bordeaux, by, elizabeth, mackintosh, this, a, retelling, in, modern, language, of, the, events, of, richard, ii, was, greeted, as, the, most, successful, historical, play, since, shaw, s, saint, joan, nine, years, earlier, more, faithful, to, the, events, than, shakespeare, had, been, after, an, uncertain, start, in, the, west, end, it, rapidly, became, a, sell, out, hit, and, played, in, london, and, on, tour, over, the, next, three, years, between, seasons, of, richard, in, 1934, gielgud, returned, to, hamlet, in, london, and, on, tour, directing, and, playing, the, title, role, the, production, was, a, box, office, success, and, the, critics, were, lavish, in, their, praise, in, the, new, york, times, charles, morgan, wrote, i, have, never, before, heard, the, rhythm, and, verse, and, the, naturalness, of, speech, so, gently, combined, if, i, see, a, better, performance, of, this, play, than, this, before, i, die, it, will, be, a, miracle, morley, writes, that, junior, members, of, the, cast, such, as, alec, guinness, and, frith, banbury, would, gather, in, the, wings, every, night, to, watch, what, they, seemed, intuitively, already, to, know, was, to, be, the, hamlet, of, their, time, mr, olivier, was, about, twenty, times, as, much, in, love, with, peggy, ashcroft, as, mr, gielgud, is, but, mr, gielgud, spoke, most, of, the, poetry, far, better, than, mr, olivier, yet, i, must, out, with, it, the, fire, of, mr, olivier, s, passion, carried, the, play, along, as, mr, gielgud, s, doesn, t, quite, herbert, farjeon, on, the, rival, romeos, the, following, year, gielgud, staged, perhaps, his, most, famous, shakespeare, production, a, romeo, and, juliet, in, which, he, co, starred, with, ashcroft, and, olivier, gielgud, had, spotted, olivier, s, potential, and, gave, him, a, major, step, up, in, his, career, for, the, first, weeks, of, the, run, gielgud, played, mercutio, and, olivier, played, romeo, after, which, they, exchanged, roles, as, at, oxford, ashcroft, and, evans, were, juliet, and, the, nurse, the, production, broke, all, box, office, records, for, the, play, running, at, the, new, theatre, for, 189, performances, olivier, was, enraged, at, the, notices, after, the, first, night, which, praised, the, virility, of, his, performance, but, fiercely, criticised, his, speaking, of, shakespeare, s, verse, comparing, it, with, his, co, star, s, mastery, of, the, poetry, the, friendship, between, the, two, men, was, prickly, on, olivier, s, side, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, may, 1936, gielgud, played, trigorin, in, the, seagull, with, evans, as, arkadina, and, ashcroft, as, nina, komisarjevsky, directed, which, made, rehearsals, difficult, as, ashcroft, with, whom, he, had, been, living, had, just, left, him, nonetheless, morley, writes, the, critical, reception, was, ecstatic, in, the, same, year, gielgud, made, his, last, pre, war, film, co, starring, with, madeleine, carroll, in, alfred, hitchcock, s, secret, agent, the, director, s, insensitivity, to, actors, made, gielgud, nervous, and, further, increased, his, dislike, of, filming, the, two, stars, were, praised, for, their, performances, but, hitchcock, s, preoccupation, with, incident, was, felt, by, critics, to, make, the, leading, roles, one, dimensional, and, the, laurels, went, to, peter, lorre, as, gielgud, s, deranged, assistant, from, september, 1936, to, february, 1937, gielgud, played, hamlet, in, north, america, opening, in, toronto, before, moving, to, new, york, and, boston, he, was, nervous, about, starring, on, broadway, for, the, first, time, particularly, as, it, became, known, that, the, popular, actor, leslie, howard, was, to, appear, there, in, a, rival, production, of, the, play, when, gielgud, opened, at, the, empire, theatre, in, october, the, reviews, were, mixed, but, as, the, actor, wrote, to, his, mother, the, audience, response, was, extraordinary, they, stay, at, the, end, and, shout, every, night, and, the, stage, door, is, beset, by, fans, howard, s, production, opened, in, november, it, was, in, gielgud, s, words, a, d, b, cle, and, the, battle, of, the, hamlets, heralded, in, the, new, york, press, was, over, almost, as, soon, as, it, had, begun, howard, s, version, closed, within, a, month, the, run, of, gielgud, s, production, beat, broadway, records, for, the, play, after, his, return, from, america, in, february, 1937, gielgud, starred, in, he, was, born, gay, by, emlyn, williams, this, romantic, tragedy, about, french, royalty, after, the, revolution, was, quite, well, received, during, its, pre, london, tour, but, was, savaged, by, the, critics, in, the, west, end, the, times, said, this, is, one, of, those, occasions, on, which, criticism, does, not, stand, about, talking, but, rubs, its, eyes, and, withdraws, hastily, with, an, embarrassed, incredulous, and, uncomprehending, blush, what, made, mr, emlyn, williams, write, this, play, or, mr, gielgud, and, miss, ffrangcon, davies, appear, in, it, is, not, to, be, understood, the, play, closed, after, twelve, performances, its, failure, so, soon, after, his, shakespearean, triumphs, prompted, gielgud, to, examine, his, career, and, his, life, his, domestic, relationship, with, perry, was, comfortable, but, unexciting, he, saw, no, future, in, a, film, career, and, the, old, vic, could, not, afford, to, stage, the, classics, on, the, large, scale, to, which, he, aspired, he, decided, that, he, must, form, his, own, company, to, play, shakespeare, and, other, classic, plays, in, the, west, end, gielgud, invested, 5, 000, most, of, his, earnings, from, the, american, hamlet, perry, who, had, family, money, put, in, the, same, sum, from, september, 1937, to, april, 1938, gielgud, was, the, tenant, of, the, queen, s, theatre, where, he, presented, a, season, consisting, of, richard, ii, the, school, for, scandal, three, sisters, and, the, merchant, of, venice, his, company, included, harry, andrews, peggy, ashcroft, glen, byam, shaw, george, devine, michael, redgrave, and, harcourt, williams, with, angela, baddeley, and, gwen, ffrangcon, davies, as, guests, his, own, roles, were, king, richard, joseph, surface, vershinin, and, shylock, gielgud, s, performances, drew, superlatives, from, reviewers, and, colleagues, agate, considered, his, richard, ii, probably, the, best, piece, of, shakespearean, acting, on, the, english, stage, today, olivier, said, that, gielgud, s, joseph, surface, was, the, best, light, comedy, performance, i, ve, ever, seen, or, ever, shall, see, the, venture, did, not, make, much, money, and, in, july, 1938, gielgud, turned, to, more, conventional, west, end, enterprises, in, unconventional, circumstances, he, directed, spring, meeting, a, farce, by, perry, and, molly, keane, presented, by, binkie, beaumont, for, whom, perry, had, just, left, gielgud, somehow, the, three, men, remained, on, excellent, terms, in, september, of, the, same, year, gielgud, appeared, in, dodie, smith, s, sentimental, comedy, dear, octopus, the, following, year, he, directed, and, appeared, in, the, importance, of, being, earnest, at, the, globe, with, evans, playing, lady, bracknell, for, the, first, time, they, were, gratified, when, allan, aynesworth, who, had, played, algernon, in, the, 1895, premiere, said, that, the, new, production, caught, the, gaiety, and, exactly, the, right, atmosphere, it, s, all, delightful, at, the, start, of, the, second, world, war, gielgud, volunteered, for, active, service, but, was, told, that, men, of, his, age, thirty, five, would, not, be, wanted, for, at, least, six, months, the, government, quickly, came, to, the, view, that, most, actors, would, do, more, good, performing, to, entertain, the, troops, and, the, general, public, than, serving, whether, suitable, or, not, in, the, armed, forces, gielgud, directed, michael, redgrave, in, a, 1940, london, production, of, the, beggar, s, opera, for, the, glyndebourne, festival, this, was, a, chaotic, affair, gielgud, s, direction, confused, his, star, and, when, redgrave, lost, his, voice, gielgud, had, to, step, in, and, sing, the, role, as, best, he, could, gielgud, felt, that, something, serious, or, even, solemn, was, necessary, for, wartime, london, where, most, entertainment, was, light, hearted, together, with, harley, granville, barker, and, guthrie, he, reopened, the, old, vic, with, shakespeare, his, king, lear, once, again, divided, the, critics, but, his, prospero, was, a, considerable, success, he, played, the, role, quite, differently, from, his, attempt, on, the, same, stage, in, 1930, in, place, of, the, manic, conjurer, his, prospero, was, very, far, from, the, usual, mixture, of, father, christmas, a, colonial, bishop, and, the, president, of, the, magicians, union, a, clear, arresting, picture, of, a, virile, renaissance, notable, according, to, brown, the, critics, singled, out, among, the, other, players, jack, hawkins, as, caliban, marius, goring, as, ariel, jessica, tandy, as, miranda, and, alec, guinness, as, ferdinand, following, the, example, of, several, of, his, stage, colleagues, gielgud, joined, tours, of, military, camps, he, gave, recitals, of, prose, and, poetry, and, acted, in, a, triple, bill, of, short, plays, including, two, from, coward, s, tonight, at, 8, 30, but, he, found, at, first, that, less, highbrow, performers, like, beatrice, lillie, were, better, than, he, at, entertaining, the, troops, he, returned, to, filming, in, 1940, as, disraeli, in, thorold, dickinson, s, the, prime, minister, in, this, morale, boosting, film, he, portrayed, the, politician, from, ages, thirty, to, seventy, this, was, in, morley, s, view, the, first, time, he, seemed, at, home, before, the, camera, gielgud, made, no, more, films, for, the, next, ten, years, he, turned, down, the, role, of, julius, caesar, in, the, 1945, film, of, shaw, s, caesar, and, cleopatra, with, vivien, leigh, he, and, leigh, were, close, friends, and, shaw, tried, hard, to, persuade, him, to, play, the, part, but, gielgud, had, taken, a, strong, dislike, to, the, director, gabriel, pascal, caesar, was, eventually, played, by, gielgud, s, former, teacher, claude, rains, throughout, 1941, and, 1942, gielgud, worked, continually, in, barrie, s, dear, brutus, another, importance, of, being, earnest, in, the, west, end, and, macbeth, on, tour, returning, with, more, assurance, than, before, to, entertaining, the, troops, he, so, far, departed, from, his, classical, style, as, to, join, lillie, and, michael, wilding, singing, a, comic, trio, his, 1943, revival, of, william, congreve, s, love, for, love, on, tour, and, then, in, london, received, high, praise, from, reviewers, in, 1944, he, was, approached, by, ralph, richardson, who, had, been, asked, by, the, governors, of, the, old, vic, to, form, a, new, company, unwilling, to, take, sole, charge, richardson, proposed, a, managing, triumvirate, of, gielgud, olivier, and, himself, gielgud, declined, it, would, be, a, disaster, you, would, have, to, spend, your, whole, time, as, referee, between, larry, and, me, a, 1944, 45, season, at, the, haymarket, for, beaumont, included, a, hamlet, that, many, considered, his, finest, agate, wrote, mr, gielgud, is, now, completely, and, authoritatively, master, of, this, tremendous, part, i, hold, that, this, is, and, is, likely, to, remain, the, best, hamlet, of, our, time, also, in, the, season, were, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, the, duchess, of, malfi, and, the, first, major, revival, of, lady, windermere, s, fan, 1945, these, productions, attracted, much, praise, but, at, this, point, in, his, career, gielgud, was, somewhat, overshadowed, by, his, old, colleagues, olivier, was, celebrated, for, his, recent, film, of, henry, v, and, with, richardson, and, john, burrell, in, gielgud, s, stead, was, making, the, old, vic, the, most, famous, theatre, in, the, anglo, saxon, world, according, to, the, critic, harold, hobson, in, late, 1945, and, early, 1946, gielgud, toured, for, ensa, in, the, middle, and, far, east, with, hamlet, and, coward, s, blithe, spirit, during, this, tour, he, played, hamlet, on, stage, for, the, last, time, he, was, raskolnikoff, in, a, stage, version, of, crime, and, punishment, in, the, west, end, in, 1946, and, on, broadway, the, following, year, agate, thought, it, the, best, thing, gielgud, had, done, so, far, other, than, hamlet, between, these, two, engagements, gielgud, toured, north, america, in, the, importance, of, being, earnest, and, love, for, love, edith, evans, was, tired, of, the, role, of, lady, bracknell, and, refused, to, join, him, margaret, rutherford, played, the, part, to, great, acclaim, gielgud, was, in, demand, as, a, director, with, six, productions, in, 1948, 49, they, included, the, heiress, in, 1949, when, he, was, brought, in, at, the, last, moment, to, direct, richardson, and, ashcroft, saving, what, seemed, a, doomed, production, it, ran, for, 644, performances, his, last, big, hit, of, the, 1940s, was, as, thomas, mendip, in, the, lady, s, not, for, burning, which, he, also, directed, the, london, cast, included, the, young, claire, bloom, and, richard, burton, who, went, with, gielgud, when, he, took, the, piece, to, the, us, the, following, year, at, the, shakespeare, memorial, theatre, stratford, upon, avon, gielgud, did, much, to, reclaim, his, position, as, a, leading, shakespearean, his, cold, unsympathetic, angelo, in, peter, brook, s, production, of, measure, for, measure, 1950, showed, the, public, a, new, naturalistic, manner, in, his, playing, he, followed, this, with, three, other, shakespeare, productions, with, brook, which, were, well, received, his, own, attempt, at, direction, in, stratford, for, richardson, s, macbeth, in, 1952, was, much, less, successful, with, poor, notices, for, the, star, and, worse, ones, for, the, director, in, 1953, gielgud, made, his, first, hollywood, film, the, sole, classical, actor, in, joseph, l, mankiewicz, s, julius, caesar, playing, cassius, marlon, brando, mark, antony, was, in, awe, of, him, and, james, mason, brutus, was, disheartened, at, gielgud, s, seemingly, effortless, skill, gielgud, for, his, part, felt, he, learned, much, about, film, technique, from, mason, gielgud, enjoyed, his, four, month, stay, in, california, not, least, as, morley, comments, for, the, relaxed, attitude, there, to, homosexuality, returning, to, london, later, in, 1953, gielgud, took, over, management, of, the, lyric, hammersmith, for, a, classical, season, of, richard, ii, congreve, s, the, way, of, the, world, and, thomas, otway, s, venice, preserv, d, directing, the, first, acting, in, the, last, and, doing, both, in, the, second, feeling, he, was, too, old, for, richard, he, cast, the, young, paul, scofield, both, the, actor, and, the, production, were, a, critical, and, commercial, success, during, the, season, gielgud, was, knighted, in, the, 1953, coronation, honours, on, the, evening, of, 20, october, 1953, gielgud, usually, highly, discreet, about, casual, sex, was, arrested, in, chelsea, for, cottaging, i, e, cruising, for, sex, in, a, public, lavatory, until, the, 1960s, sexual, activity, of, any, kind, between, men, was, illegal, in, britain, the, home, secretary, of, the, day, david, maxwell, fyfe, was, fervently, homophobic, urging, the, police, to, arrest, anyone, who, contravened, the, victorian, laws, against, homosexuality, gielgud, was, fined, when, the, press, reported, the, story, he, thought, his, disgrace, would, end, his, career, when, the, news, broke, he, was, in, liverpool, on, the, pre, london, tour, of, a, new, play, a, day, by, the, sea, according, to, the, biographer, richard, huggett, gielgud, was, so, paralysed, by, nerves, that, the, prospect, of, going, onstage, as, usual, seemed, impossible, but, his, fellow, players, led, by, sybil, thorndike, encouraged, him, she, grabbed, him, and, whispered, fiercely, come, on, john, darling, they, won, t, boo, me, and, led, him, firmly, on, to, the, stage, to, everybody, s, astonishment, and, indescribable, relief, the, audience, gave, him, a, standing, ovation, they, cheered, they, applauded, they, shouted, the, message, was, quite, clear, the, english, public, had, always, been, loyal, to, its, favourites, and, this, was, their, chance, to, show, that, they, didn, t, care, tuppence, what, he, had, done, in, his, private, life, they, loved, him, and, respected, him, dearly, it, was, a, moment, never, to, be, forgotten, by, those, who, witnessed, it, his, career, was, safe, but, the, episode, briefly, affected, gielgud, s, health, he, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, some, months, afterwards, he, never, spoke, publicly, about, the, incident, and, it, was, quickly, sidelined, by, the, press, and, politely, ignored, by, writers, during, his, lifetime, privately, he, made, donations, to, gay, campaign, groups, but, did, not, endorse, them, in, public, in, his, later, years, he, said, to, the, actor, simon, callow, i, do, admire, people, like, you, and, ian, mckellen, for, coming, out, but, i, can, t, be, doing, with, that, myself, between, december, 1953, and, june, 1955, gielgud, concentrated, on, directing, and, did, not, appear, on, stage, his, productions, ranged, from, a, revival, of, charley, s, aunt, with, john, mills, to, the, cherry, orchard, with, ffrangcon, davies, and, twelfth, night, with, olivier, his, return, to, the, stage, was, in, a, production, of, king, lear, which, was, badly, hampered, by, costumes, and, scenery, by, isamu, noguchi, that, the, critics, found, ludicrous, a, revival, of, much, ado, about, nothing, with, ashcroft, in, 1955, was, much, better, received, in, the, manchester, guardian, philip, hope, wallace, called, it, shakespearean, comedy, for, once, perfectly, realised, in, 1955, gielgud, made, his, second, appearance, in, a, film, of, shakespeare, portraying, clarence, in, olivier, s, richard, iii, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1950s, gielgud, s, career, was, in, the, doldrums, as, far, as, new, plays, were, concerned, british, theatre, was, moving, away, from, the, west, end, glamour, of, beaumont, s, productions, to, more, avant, garde, works, olivier, had, a, great, success, in, john, osborne, s, the, entertainer, in, 1957, but, gielgud, was, not, in, tune, with, the, new, wave, of, writers, he, remained, in, demand, as, a, shakespearean, but, there, were, few, new, plays, suitable, for, him, he, directed, and, played, the, lead, in, coward, s, nude, with, violin, in, 1956, which, was, dismissed, by, the, critics, as, old, fashioned, though, it, ran, for, more, than, a, year, he, made, two, film, appearances, playing, a, cameo, comedy, scene, with, coward, as, a, prospective, manservant, in, michael, anderson, s, around, the, world, in, 80, days, 1956, and, as, the, father, of, elizabeth, barrett, browning, in, sidney, franklin, s, 1957, remake, of, the, barretts, of, wimpole, street, he, did, not, consider, his, performance, as, the, tyrannical, father, convincing, and, confessed, that, he, undertook, it, only, for, the, large, fee, it, will, set, me, up, for, a, couple, of, years, and, to, keep, him, before, the, public, in, america, where, he, had, not, performed, for, over, four, years, during, 1957, gielgud, directed, berlioz, s, the, trojans, at, covent, garden, and, played, prospero, at, drury, lane, but, the, production, central, to, his, career, over, the, late, 1950s, and, into, the, 1960s, was, his, one, man, show, the, ages, of, man, he, first, appeared, in, this, in, 1956, and, revived, it, every, year, until, 1967, it, was, an, anthology, of, shakespearean, speeches, and, sonnets, compiled, by, george, rylands, in, which, wearing, modern, evening, clothes, on, a, plain, stage, gielgud, recited, the, verses, with, his, own, linking, commentary, he, performed, it, all, over, britain, mainland, europe, australasia, and, the, us, including, a, performance, at, the, white, house, in, 1965, he, found, there, were, advantages, to, performing, solo, you, ve, no, idea, how, much, easier, it, is, without, a, juliet, when, there, s, a, beautiful, girl, above, you, on, a, balcony, or, lying, on, a, tomb, with, candles, round, her, naturally, the, audience, look, at, her, the, whole, time, and, romeo, has, to, pull, out, all, the, stops, to, get, any, attention, his, performance, on, broadway, won, him, a, special, tony, award, in, 1959, and, an, audio, recording, in, 1979, received, a, grammy, award, he, made, many, other, recordings, both, before, and, after, this, including, ten, shakespeare, plays, gielgud, continued, to, try, without, much, success, to, find, new, plays, that, suited, him, as, an, actor, but, his, direction, of, peter, shaffer, s, first, play, five, finger, exercise, 1958, received, acclaim, while, in, the, us, for, the, shaffer, play, gielgud, revived, much, ado, about, nothing, this, time, with, margaret, leighton, as, his, beatrice, most, of, the, new, york, critics, praised, the, production, and, they, all, praised, the, co, stars, he, gave, his, first, performances, on, television, during, 1959, in, rattigan, s, the, browning, version, for, cbs, and, n, c, hunter, s, a, day, by, the, sea, for, itv, he, appeared, in, more, than, fifty, more, plays, on, television, over, the, next, four, decades, during, the, early, 1960s, gielgud, had, more, successes, as, a, director, than, as, an, actor, he, directed, the, first, london, performance, of, britten, s, opera, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, 1961, at, covent, garden, and, hugh, wheeler, s, big, fish, little, fish, on, broadway, the, latter, winning, him, a, tony, for, best, direction, of, a, play, in, 1961, his, performance, as, othello, at, stratford, in, the, same, year, was, less, successful, franco, zeffirelli, s, production, was, thought, ponderous, and, gielgud, singularly, unvehement, as, gaev, in, the, cherry, orchard, to, the, ranevskaya, of, ashcroft, he, had, the, best, of, the, notices, his, co, star, and, the, production, received, mixed, reviews, the, following, year, gielgud, directed, richardson, in, the, school, for, scandal, first, at, the, haymarket, and, then, on, a, north, american, tour, which, he, joined, as, in, his, words, the, oldest, joseph, surface, in, the, business, in, 1962, gielgud, met, martin, hensler, 1932, 99, an, interior, designer, exiled, from, hungary, he, was, temperamental, and, gielgud, s, friends, often, found, him, difficult, but, the, two, became, a, long, term, couple, and, lived, together, until, hensler, s, death, under, his, influence, gielgud, moved, his, main, residence, from, central, london, to, the, south, pavilion, of, wotton, house, at, wotton, underwood, in, buckinghamshire, gielgud, received, an, oscar, nomination, for, his, performance, as, king, louis, vii, of, france, in, becket, 1964, with, richard, burton, in, the, title, role, morley, comments, a, minor, but, flashy, role, this, had, considerable, and, long, lasting, importance, his, unrivalled, theatrical, dignity, could, greatly, enhance, a, film, in, 1964, gielgud, directed, burton, in, hamlet, on, broadway, burton, s, performance, received, reviews, ranging, from, polite, to, hostile, but, the, production, was, a, box, office, success, and, a, film, was, made, of, it, gielgud, finally, began, to, take, the, cinema, seriously, for, financial, and, sometimes, artistic, reasons, he, told, his, agent, to, accept, any, reasonable, film, offers, his, films, of,

of, the, hamlet, whose, influence, lasted, more, than, 30, years, even, the, recordings, do, not, quite, convey, the, mellifluous, magic, of, the, voice, once, described, by, guinness, as, a, silver,

stage, as, he, wrote, at, the, close, of, an, actor, and, his, time, 1979, he, saw, the, theatre, as, more, than, an, occupation, or, a, profession, for, me, it, has, been, a, life, notes, references
