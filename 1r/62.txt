nijinsky, during, rehearsals, in, russia, they, took, the, travel, arrangements, and, accommodation, as, confirmation, of, a, relationship, prince, lvov, had, visited, nijinsky, s, mother, in, st, petersburg, telling, her, tearfully, that, he, would, no, longer, be, taking, a, special, interest, in, her, son, but, he, advanced, a, significant, sum, to, diaghilev, towards, the, tour, s, expenses, mavrine, was, known, to, have, been, diaghilev, s, lover, but, left, the, tour, together, with, olga, pedorova, shortly, after, it, had, begun, the, season, of, colorful, russian, ballets, and, operas, works, mostly, new, to, the, west, was, a, great, success, the, paris, seasons, of, the, ballets, russes, were, an, artistic, and, social, sensation, setting, trends, in, art, dance, music, and, fashion, for, the, next, decade, nijinsky, s, unique, talent, showed, in, fokine, s, pieces, such, as, le, pavillon, d, armide, music, by, nikolai, tcherepnin, cleopatra, music, by, anton, arensky, and, other, russian, composers, and, a, divertissement, la, f, te, his, expressive, execution, of, a, pas, de, deux, from, the, sleeping, beauty, tchaikovsky, was, a, tremendous, success, in,

soul, was, a, remarkable, display, of, his, expressive, ability, to, portray, characters, his, partnership, with, tamara, karsavina, also, of, the, mariinsky, theatre, was, legendary, and, they, have, been, called, the, most, exemplary, artists, of, the, time, in, january, 1911, he, danced, in, giselle, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, st, petersburg, for, the, imperial, ballet, with, the, tsarina, alexandra, feodorovna, in, attendance, his, costume, which, had, been, designed, by, benois, and, used, in, paris, before, caused, a, scandal, as, he, danced, in, tights, without, the, then, common, trousers, he, refused, to, apologize, and, was, dismissed, from, the, imperial, ballet, it, is, possible, that, he, was, not, altogether, unhappy, about, this, development, as, he, was, now, free, to, concentrate, on, the, ballets, russes, nijinsky, took, the, creative, reins, and, choreographed, ballets, which, pushed, boundaries, and, stirred, controversy, his, ballets, were, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, the, afternoon, of, a, faun, based, on, claude, debussy, s, pr, lude, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, 1912, jeux, 1913, and, till, eulenspiegel, 1916, these, introduced, his, audiences, to, the, new, direction, of, modern, dance, as, the, title, character, in, l, apr, s, midi, d, un, faune, in, the, final, tableau, he, mimed, masturbation, with, the, scarf, of, a, nymph, causing, a, scandal, he, was, defended, by, such, artists, as, auguste, rodin, odilon, redon, and, marcel, proust, nijinsky, s, new, trends, in, dance, caused, a, riotous, reaction, at, the, th, tre, de, champs, lys, es, when, they, premiered, in, paris, in, the, rite, of, spring, le, sacre, du, printemps, with, music, by, igor, stravinsky, 1913, nijinsky, created, choreography, that, exceeded, the, limits, of, traditional, ballet, and, propriety, the, radically, angular, movements, expressed, the, heart, of, stravinsky, s, radically, modern, score, violence, broke, out, in, the, audience, as, the, rite, of, spring, premiered, the, theme, of, the, ballet, based, on, pagan, myths, was, a, young, maiden, who, sacrificed, herself, by, dancing, until, she, died, the, theme, the, difficult, and, challenging, music, of, stravinsky, and, nijinsky, s, choreography, led, to, a, violent, uproar, diaghilev, was, pleased, with, the, notoriety, nijinsky, s, work, in, choreographing, ballets, had, proved, controversial, they, were, time, consuming, to, rehearse, and, badly, received, by, critics, diaghilev, asked, him, to, begin, preparing, a, new, ballet, la, l, gende, de, joseph, based, on, the, bible, aside, from, nijinsky, s, difficulties, diaghilev, came, under, pressure, from, financial, backers, and, theatre, owners, who, wanted, productions, more, in, the, style, of, previous, successful, work, although, diaghilev, had, become, unhappy, with, fokine, s, work, thinking, he, had, lost, his, originality, he, returned, to, him, for, two, new, ballets, including, joseph, relations, between, diaghilev, and, nijinsky, had, deteriorated, under, the, stress, of, nijinsky, s, becoming, principal, choreographer, and, his, pivotal, role, in, the, company, s, financial, success, diaghilev, could, not, face, nijinsky, to, tell, him, personally, that, he, would, no, longer, be, choreographing, the, ballet, joseph, but, instead, asked, his, sister, bronia, nijinska, to, deliver, the, bad, news, the, company, was, to, embark, on, a, tour, of, south, america, in, august, 1913, nijinska, who, had, always, worked, closely, with, her, brother, and, supported, him, could, not, accompany, the, tour, because, she, had, married, in, july, 1912, and, become, pregnant, in, october, 1912, their, father, had, died, while, on, tour, with, his, dance, company, causing, another, stress, for, the, siblings, diaghilev, did, not, accompany, the, south, american, tour, claiming, he, had, been, told, that, he, would, die, on, the, ocean, others, have, suggested, the, reason, had, more, to, do, with, wanting, to, spend, time, away, from, nijinsky, and, enjoy, a, holiday, in, venice, where, perhaps, adventures, with, pretty, dark, eyed, boys, awaited, him, nijinsky, set, sail, on, a, 21, day, sea, voyage, in, a, state, of, turmoil, and, without, the, people, who, had, been, his, closest, advisers, in, recent, years, the, tour, party, included, romola, de, pulszky, whose, father, count, charles, pulszky, was, a, hungarian, politician, and, mother, emilia, m, rkus, was, a, noted, actress, in, march, 1912, the, recently, engaged, romola, was, taken, to, see, the, ballets, russes, in, budapest, by, her, prospective, mother, in, law, and, was, greatly, impressed, nijinsky, had, not, been, performing, but, she, returned, the, following, day, and, saw, him, an, electric, shock, passed, through, the, entire, audience, intoxicated, entranced, gasping, for, breath, we, followed, this, superhuman, being, the, power, the, featherweight, lightness, the, steel, like, strength, the, suppleness, of, his, movements, romola, broke, off, her, engagement, and, began, following, the, ballets, russes, across, europe, attending, every, performance, she, could, nijinsky, was, difficult, to, approach, being, always, accompanied, by, a, minder, however, romola, befriended, adolf, bolm, who, had, previously, visited, her, mother, thereby, gaining, access, to, the, company, and, backstage, she, and, nijinsky, shared, no, common, language, she, spoke, french, but, he, knew, only, a, little, so, many, of, their, early, conversations, involved, an, interpreter, when, first, introduced, to, her, he, gained, the, impression, she, was, a, hungarian, prima, ballerina, and, was, friendly, discovering, his, mistake, he, ignored, her, thereafter, romola, did, not, give, up, she, persuaded, diaghilev, that, her, amorous, interests, lay, with, bolm, that, she, was, rich, and, interested, in, supporting, ballet, he, allowed, her, to, take, ballet, lessons, with, enrico, cecchetti, who, accompanied, the, troupe, coaching, the, dancers, nijinsky, objected, to, her, taking, class, with, the, professionals, cecchetti, warned, her, against, becoming, involved, with, nijinsky, describing, him, as, like, a, sun, that, pours, forth, light, but, never, warms, but, diaghilev, s, endorsement, meant, that, nijinsky, paid, her, some, attention, romola, took, every, opportunity, to, be, near, nijinsky, booking, train, compartments, or, cabins, close, to, his, she, was, likely, warned, that, he, was, homosexual, by, marie, rambert, whom, romola, befriended, and, who, was, also, in, love, with, nijinsky, as, a, devout, catholic, she, prayed, for, his, conversion, to, heterosexuality, she, referred, to, him, as, le, petit, and, wanted, to, have, his, child, on, board, ship, romola, had, a, cabin, in, first, class, which, allowed, her, to, keep, a, watch, on, nijinsky, s, door, while, most, of, the, company, were, exiled, to, second, class, she, befriended, his, masseur, and, was, rewarded, with, a, rundown, on, his, musculature, determined, to, take, every, opportunity, she, succeeded, in, spending, more, and, more, time, in, his, company, the, unexpected, friendliness, was, noticed, by, baron, de, gunsbourg, an, investor, in, the, ballets, russes, who, had, been, tasked, with, keeping, an, eye, on, the, company, instead, of, reporting, to, diaghilev, on, what, was, occurring, gunsbourg, agreed, to, act, on, nijinsky, s, behalf, in, presenting, a, proposal, of, marriage, to, romola, romola, thought, a, cruel, joke, was, being, played, on, her, and, ran, off, to, her, cabin, crying, however, nijinsky, asked, her, again, in, broken, french, and, mime, and, she, accepted, although, gunsbourg, had, a, financial, interest, in, ballets, russes, he, was, also, interested, in, forming, his, own, company, and, a, split, between, diaghilev, and, his, star, dancer, might, have, presented, him, with, an, opportunity, when, the, ship, stopped, at, rio, de, janeiro, brazil, the, couple, went, straight, to, buy, wedding, rings, adolph, bolm, warned, romola, against, proceeding, saying, it, will, ruin, your, life, gunsbourg, hurried, to, arrange, the, marriage, getting, permission, by, telegram, from, romola, s, mother, a, quick, wedding, could, take, place, once, the, ship, arrived, at, buenos, aires, argentina, the, couple, were, married, on, 10, september, 1913, and, the, event, was, announced, to, the, world, s, press, back, in, europe, diaghilev, gave, himself, to, a, wild, orgy, of, dissipation, sobbing, shamelessly, in, russian, despair, he, bellowed, accusations, and, recriminations, he, cursed, nijinsky, s, ingratitude, romola, s, treachery, and, his, own, stupidity, as, the, company, was, due, to, start, performing, immediately, the, couple, had, no, honeymoon, a, few, days, after, the, marriage, nijinsky, tried, to, teach, romola, some, ballet, but, she, was, not, interested, i, asked, her, to, learn, dancing, because, for, me, dancing, was, the, highest, thing, in, the, world, i, realized, that, i, had, made, a, mistake, but, the, mistake, was, irreparable, i, had, put, myself, in, the, hands, of, someone, who, did, not, love, me, romola, and, nijinsky, did, not, share, accommodations, until, after, the, season, was, safely, underway, when, she, was, eventually, invited, to, join, him, in, separate, bedrooms, in, his, hotel, suite, she, almost, cried, with, thankfulness, that, he, showed, no, interest, in, making, love, on, their, wedding, night, on, returning, to, paris, nijinsky, anticipated, returning, to, work, on, new, ballets, but, diaghilev, did, not, meet, him, eventually, he, sent, a, telegram, to, nijinsky, informing, him, that, he, was, no, longer, employed, by, the, ballets, russes, nijinsky, had, missed, a, performance, in, rio, when, romola, was, ill, and, only, in, the, case, of, a, dancer, s, own, illness, certified, by, a, doctor, was, the, dancer, allowed, to, miss, a, performance, diaghilev, also, usually, dismissed, dancers, who, married, this, was, perhaps, beside, the, point, since, nijinsky, had, never, had, a, contract, nor, wages, all, his, expenses, having, been, paid, by, diaghilev, his, mother, also, received, an, allowance, of, 500, francs, per, month, other, senior, dancers, had, received, 200, 000, francs, for, a, six, month, season, fokine, was, re, employed, by, diaghilev, as, choreographer, and, premier, danseur, accepting, on, the, condition, that, none, of, nijinsky, s, ballets, would, be, performed, leonide, massine, joined, the, company, as, the, new, attractive, young, lead, for, joseph, the, ballets, russes, had, lost, its, most, famous, and, crowd, pulling, dancer, but, nijinsky, s, position, was, even, more, difficult, he, appears, not, to, have, appreciated, that, his, marriage, would, result, in, a, break, with, diaghilev, s, company, although, many, others, immediately, expected, this, would, be, the, result, the, ballets, russes, and, the, imperial, russian, ballet, were, the, pre, eminent, ballet, companies, in, the, world, and, uniquely, had, permanent, companies, of, dancers, staging, full, scale, new, productions, nijinsky, now, was, an, experimental, artist, he, needed, roles, that, would, extend, his, gifts, and, above, all, he, needed, to, choreograph, for, these, things, he, did, need, the, ballets, russes, which, at, that, time, was, the, only, forward, thinking, ballet, company, in, the, world, not, only, had, nijinsky, previously, left, the, imperial, ballet, on, doubtful, terms, but, he, had, not, been, granted, exemption, from, compulsory, military, service, in, russia, something, that, was, normally, given, to, its, dancers, he, could, find, only, two, offers, one, a, position, with, the, paris, opera, which, would, not, start, for, more, than, a, year, the, other, to, take, a, ballet, company, to, london, for, eight, weeks, to, perform, as, part, of, a, mixed, bill, at, the, palace, theatre, anna, pavlova, sent, him, a, caustic, telegram, reminding, him, that, he, had, disapproved, some, years, before, when, she, had, appeared, there, in, vaudeville, on, another, occasion, he, had, told, a, reporter, one, thing, i, am, determined, not, to, do, and, that, is, to, go, on, the, music, hall, stage, bronia, was, still, in, st, petersburg, following, the, birth, of, her, child, and, nijinsky, asked, her, to, be, part, of, his, new, company, she, was, glad, to, do, so, being, concerned, at, how, well, he, could, cope, without, his, customary, supporters, when, she, arrived, there, was, friction, between, her, and, romola, bronia, was, critical, that, the, new, central, figure, in, her, brother, s, life, showed, so, little, organisational, ability, romola, resented, the, closeness, between, brother, and, sister, both, in, their, shared, language, and, in, ability, to, work, together, in, dance, the, final, company, had, only, three, experienced, dancers, nijinsky, and, bronia, plus, her, husband, scenery, was, late, fokine, refused, to, allow, the, use, of, his, ballets, there, was, inadequate, time, to, rehearse, and, nijinsky, became, more, and, more, nervous, and, distraught, diaghilev, came, to, the, opening, night, in, march, 1914, the, audience, divided, between, those, who, had, never, seen, ballet, who, objected, to, the, delays, necessary, for, scene, changes, and, those, who, had, seen, nijinsky, before, who, generally, felt, something, was, lacking, he, no, longer, danced, like, a, god, on, another, night, when, the, orchestra, played, music, during, the, scene, change, so, as, to, calm, the, audience, nijinsky, having, expressly, banned, this, flew, into, a, rage, and, was, discovered, half, dressed, and, screaming, in, his, dressing, room, he, had, to, be, calmed, down, enough, to, perform, he, jumped, on, a, stagehand, who, had, flirted, with, romola, i, had, never, seen, vaslav, like, that, a, new, program, was, to, be, performed, for, the, third, week, but, a, packed, house, had, to, be, told, that, nijinsky, was, ill, with, a, high, temperature, and, could, not, perform, he, missed, three, days, and, the, management, had, had, enough, the, show, was, cancelled, and, nijinsky, was, left, with, a, considerable, financial, loss, newspapers, reported, a, nervous, breakdown, his, physical, vulnerability, had, been, aggravated, by, the, great, stress, romola, was, pregnant, so, the, couple, returned, to, budapest, austro, hungary, to, his, mother, in, law, emilia, markus, house, their, daughter, kyra, was, born, on, 19, june, 1914, with, the, start, of, the, great, war, world, war, i, nijinsky, was, classified, as, an, enemy, russian, citizen, he, was, confined, to, house, arrest, in, budapest, and, could, not, leave, the, country, the, war, made, problems, for, the, ballets, russes, too, the, company, had, difficulty, recruiting, dancers, and, fokine, returned, to, russia, diaghilev, started, negotiations, in, october, 1914, for, nijinsky, to, work, again, for, the, company, but, could, not, obtain, release, of, the, dancer, until, 1916, the, complex, negotiations, included, a, prisoner, exchange, with, the, united, states, and, agreement, that, nijinsky, would, dance, and, choreograph, for, the, ballets, russes, tour, king, alfonso, xiii, of, spain, queen, alexandra, of, denmark, dowager, russian, empress, marie, feodorovna, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, pope, benedict, xv, and, president, wilson, at, the, urging, of, otto, kahn, all, interceded, on, his, behalf, nijinsky, arrived, in, new, york, on, 4, april, 1916, the, tour, had, already, started, in, january, with, a, number, of, problems, faun, was, considered, too, sexually, explicit, and, had, to, be, amended, scheherazade, including, an, orgy, between, blacks, and, whites, did, not, appeal, to, americans, and, ballet, aficionados, were, calling, for, nijinsky, romola, took, over, negotiations, demanding, that, diaghilev, pay, nijinsky, for, the, years, he, had, been, unpaid, by, the, ballets, russes, before, he, would, dance, in, new, york, this, was, settled, after, another, week, s, delay, by, a, down, payment, of, 13, 000, against, the, 90, 000, claimed, plus, a, fee, of, 1000, for, each, performance, in, america, negotiations, with, otto, kahn, of, the, new, york, metropolitan, opera, led, to, an, additional, tour, of, the, us, being, agreed, to, for, the, autumn, kahn, did, not, get, on, with, diaghilev, and, insisted, nijinsky, should, manage, the, tour, massine, and, diaghilev, returned, to, europe, leaving, nijinsky, to, dance, and, manage, a, company, of, more, than, 100, for, a, salary, of, 60, 000, nijinsky, was, also, to, prepare, two, new, ballets, rehearsals, for, till, eulenspiegel, did, not, go, well, nijinsky, s, poor, communication, skills, meant, that, he, could, not, explain, to, dancers, what, he, wanted, he, would, explode, into, rages, pierre, monteux, the, conductor, refused, to, take, part, in, performances, because, he, did, not, want, to, be, associated, with, failure, nijinsky, twisted, his, ankle, postponing, the, season, s, opening, for, a, week, and, his, own, appearance, by, two, weeks, rehearsals, for, eulenspiegel, had, not, been, completed, and, it, had, to, be, improvised, during, its, first, performance, it, was, still, well, received, and, nijinsky, s, performance, in, faun, was, considered, better, than, massine, s, as, the, tour, progressed, nijinsky, s, performances, received, steady, acclaim, although, his, management, was, haphazard, and, contributed, to, the, tour, s, loss, of, 250, 000, his, last, professional, public, performance, was, during, a, south, american, tour, with, pianist, arthur, rubinstein, in, a, benefit, in, montevideo, for, the, red, cross, on, 30, september, 1917, at, age, twenty, eight, rubinstein, wept, when, he, saw, nijinsky, s, confusion, that, night, it, was, around, this, time, that, signs, of, his, schizophrenia, had, become, apparent, to, members, of, the, company, including, bourman, nijinsky, and, his, wife, moved, to, st, moritz, switzerland, where, he, tried, to, recover, from, the, stresses, of, the, tour, also, in, 1917, bronia, and, vaslav, lost, their, older, brother, stanislav, who, died, in, a, hospital, in,

climbers, bertha, asseo, a, family, friend, played, the, piano, vaslav, stood, still, for, a, good, while, before, he, finally, started, moving, his, dance, reflected, a, wide, range, of, feelings, from, sadness, and, anger, to, joyfulness, his, strong, feelings, towards, the, devastation, of, the, war, and, people, who, did, nothing, to, stop, it, were, also, reflected, in, his, dance, nijinsky, s, diary, which, he, wrote, from, january, to, early, march, 1919, expressed, his, great, fear, of, hospitalization, and, confinement, he, filled, it, with, drawings, of, eyes, as, he, felt, himself, under, scrutiny, by, his, wife, a, young, doctor, frenkel, and, others, finally, romola, arranged, a, consultation, in, zurich, with, the, psychiatrist, eugen, bleuler, in, 1919, asking, her, mother, and, stepfather, for, help, in, getting, nijinsky, there, his, fears, were, realized, he, was, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, and, committed, to, burgh, lzli, after, a, few, days, he, was,

foundation, founded, by, her, mother, to, preserve, art, and, writing, associated, with, her, parents, and, her, father, s, dances, nijinsky, s, diary, was, written, during, the, six, weeks, in, 1919, he, spent, in, switzerland, before, being, committed, to, the, asylum, to, zurich, it, reflected, the, decline, of, his, household, into, chaos, he, elevated, feeling, and, action, in, his, writing, it, combined, elements, of, autobiography, with, appeals, for, compassion, toward, the, less, fortunate, discovering, the, three, notebooks, of, the, diary, years, later, plus, another, with, letters, to, a, variety, of, people, his, wife, published, a, bowdlerized, version, of, the, diary, in, 1936, translated, into, english, by, jennifer, mattingly, she, deleted, about, 40, per, cent, of, the, diary, especially, references, to, bodily, functions, sex, and, homosexuality, recasting, nijinsky, as, an, involuntary, homosexual, she, also, removed, some, of, his, more, unflattering, references, to, her, and, others, close, to, their, household, she, moved, sections, around, obscuring, the, march, of, events, obvious, in, the, original, version, and, toning, down, some, of, the, odder, portions, including, trying, to, distinguish, between, sections, in, which, he, writes, as, god, and, others, as, himself, in, the, original, all, such, sections, are, written, the, same, in, 1995, the, first, unexpurgated, edition, of, the, diary, of, vaslav, nijinsky, was, published, edited, by, new, yorker, dance, critic, joan, acocella, and, translated, by, kyril, fitzlyon, acocella, notes, that, the, diary, displays, three, elements, common, to, schizophrenia, delusions, disorganized, language, and, disorganized, behavior, it, also, demonstrates, that, nijinsky, s, thought, was, showing, a, breakdown, in, selective, attention, his, associations, would, connect, in, ever, widening, circles, a, new, york, times, review, said, how, ironic, that, in, erasing, the, real, ugliness, of, his, insanity, the, old, version, silenced, not, only, nijinsky, s, true, voice, but, the, magnificently, gifted, body, from, which, it, came, and, how, fortunate, we, are, to, have, them, both, restored, nijinsky, is, immortalized, in, numerous, still, photographs, many, of, them, by, e, o, hopp, who, photographed, the, ballets, russes, seasons, in, london, extensively, between, 1909, and, 1921, no, film, exists, of, nijinsky, dancing, diaghilev, never, allowed, the, ballets, russes, to, be, filmed, because, he, felt, that, the, quality, of, film, at, the, time, could, never, capture, the, artistry, of, his, dancers, he, believed, that, the, reputation, of, the, company, would, suffer, if, people, saw, their, performance, only, in, the, short, jerky, films, of, the, period, on, 11,
