fourteen, points, speech, he, sharply, criticized, george, creel, whom, the, president, appointed, to, head, wartime, propaganda, efforts, at, the, committee, on, public, information, while, he, was, prepared, to, curb, his, liberal, instincts, because, of, the, war, saying, he, had, no, doctrinaire, belief, in, free, speech, he, nonetheless, advised, wilson, that, censorship, should, never, be, entrusted, to, anyone, who, is, not, himself, tolerant, nor, to, anyone, who, is, unacquainted, with, the, long, record, of, folly, which, is, the, history, of, suppression, lippmann, examined, the, coverage, of, newspapers, and, saw, many, inaccuracies, and, other, problems, he, and, charles, merz, in, a, 1920, study, entitled, a, test, of, the, news, stated, that, the, new, york, times,

the, phrase, cold, war, to, a, common, currency, in, his, 1947, book, by, the, same, name, it, was, lippmann, who, first, identified, the, tendency, of, journalists, to, generalize, about, other, people, based, on, fixed, ideas, he, argued, that, people, including, journalists, are, more, apt, to, believe, the, pictures, in, their, heads, than, to, come, to, judgment, by, critical, thinking, humans, condense, ideas, into, symbols, he, wrote, and, journalism, a, force, quickly, becoming, the, mass, media, is, an, ineffective, method, of, educating, the, public, even, if, journalists, did, better, jobs, of, informing, the, public, about, important, issues, lippmann, believed, the, mass, of, the, reading, public, is, not, interested, in, learning, and, assimilating, the, results, of, accurate, investigation, citizens, he, wrote, were, too, self, centered, to, care, about, public, policy, except, as, pertaining, to, pressing, local, issues, lippmann, saw, nationalist, separatism, imperialist, competition, and, failed, states, as, key, causes, of, war, he, envisioned, the, eventual, decline, of, the, nation, state, and, its, replacement, with, large, inclusive, and, democratic, political, units, as, solution, to, the, problem, of, failed, states, he, proposed, the, creation, of, regional, authorities, to, provide, political, control, as, well, as, education, of, public, opinion, to, build, support, for, these, regional, governments, he, called, for, the, creation, of, international, organizations, for, each, crisis, region, in, the, world, there, should, be, in, existence, permanent, international, commissions, to, deal, with, those, spots, of, the, earth, where, world, crises, originate, he, saw, the, creation, of, the, united, states, in, 1789, as, a, model, for, a, proposed, world, state, or, supranational, government, as, it, was, possible, to, create, a, constitution, to, bring, order, to, an, otherwise, anarchic, area, commerce, and, regular, interactions, between, people, from, different, nations, would, alleviate, the, adverse, aspects, of, nationalism, after, the, fall, of, the, british, colony, singapore, in, february, 1942, lippmann, authored, an, influential, washington, post, column, that, criticized, empire, and, called, on, western, nations, to, identify, their, cause, with, the, freedom, and, security, of, the, peoples, of, the, east, and, purge, themselves, of, white, man, s, imperialism, following, the, removal, from, office, of, secretary, of, commerce, and, former, vice, president, of, the, united, states, henry, a, wallace, in, september, 1946, lippmann, became, the, leading, public, advocate, of, the, need, to, respect, a, soviet, sphere, of, influence, in, europe, as, opposed, to, the, containment, strategy, being, advocated, at, the, time, by, george, f, kennan, lippmann, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1947, and, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1949, lippmann, was, an, informal, adviser, to, several, presidents, on, september, 14, 1964, president, lyndon, johnson, presented, lippmann, with, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, he, later, feuded, with, johnson, over, his, handling, of, the, vietnam, war, of, which, lippmann, had, become, highly, critical, he, won, a, special, pulitzer, prize, for, journalism, in, 1958, as, a, nationally, syndicated, columnist, citing, the, wisdom, perception, and, high, sense, of, responsibility, with, which, he, has, commented, for, many, years, on, national, and, international, affairs, four, years, later, he, won, the, annual, pulitzer, prize, for, international, reporting, citing, his, 1961, interview, with, soviet, premier, khrushchev, as, illustrative, of, lippmann, s, long, and, distinguished, contribution, to, american, journalism, lippmann, retired, from, his, syndicated, column, in, 1967, lippmann, died, in, new, york, city, due, to, cardiac, arrest, in, 1974, though, a, journalist, himself, lippmann, did, not, assume, that, news, and, truth, are, synonymous, for, lippmann, the, function, of, news, is, to, signalize, an, event, the, function, of, truth, is, to, bring, to, light, the, hidden, facts, to, set, them, in, relation, with, each, other, and, make, a, picture, of, reality, on, which, men, can, act, a, journalist, s, version, of, the, truth, is, subjective, and, limited, to, how, they, construct, their, reality, the, news, therefore, is, imperfectly, recorded, and, too, fragile, to, bear, the, charge, as, an, organ, of, direct, democracy, to, lippmann, democratic, ideals, had, deteriorated, voters, were, largely, ignorant, about, issues, and, policies, and, lacked, the, competence, to, participate, in, public, life, and, cared, little, for, participating, in, the, political, process, in, public, opinion, 1922, lippmann, noted, that, modern, realities, threatened, the, stability, that, the, government, had, achieved, during, the, patronage, era, of, the, 19th, century, he, wrote, that, a, governing, class, must, rise, to, face, the, new, challenges, the, basic, problem, of, democracy, he, wrote, was, the, accuracy, of, news, and, protection, of, sources, he, argued, that, distorted, information, was, inherent, in, the, human, mind, people, make, up, their, minds, before, they, define, the, facts, while, the, ideal, would, be, to, gather, and, analyze, the, facts, before, reaching, conclusions, by, seeing, first, he, argued, it, is, possible, to, sanitize, polluted, information, lippmann, argued, that, interpretation, as, stereotypes, a, word, which, he, coined, in, that, specific, meaning, subjected, us, to, partial, truths, lippmann, called, the, notion, of, a, public, competent, to, direct, public, affairs, a, false, ideal, he, compared, the, political, savvy, of, an, average, man, to, a, theater, goer, walking, into, a, play, in, the, middle, of, the, third, act, and, leaving, before, the, last, curtain, john, dewey, in, his, book, the, public, and, its, problems, published, in, 1927, agreed, about, the, irrationality, of, public, opinion, but, he, rejected, lippmann, s, call, for, a, technocratic, elite, dewey, believed, that, in, a, democracy, the, public, is, also, part, of, the, public, discourse, the, lippmann, dewey, debate, started, to, be, widely, discussed, by, the, late, 1980s, in, american, communication, studies, circles, lippmann, also, figured, prominently, in, the, work, manufacturing, consent, by, edward, s, herman, and, noam, chomsky, who, cited, lippmann, s, advocacy, of, manufacture, of, consent, which, referred, to, the, management, of, public, opinion, which, felt, was, necessary, for, democracy, to, flourish, since, he, felt, that, public, opinion, was, an, irrational, force, in, 1932, lippmann, famously, dismissed, future, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, qualifications, and, demeanor, writing, franklin, d, roosevelt, is, no, crusader, he, is, no, tribune, of, the, people, he, is, no, enemy, of, entrenched, privilege, he, is, a, pleasant, man, who, without, any, important, qualifications, for, the, office, would, very, much, like, to, be, president, despite, roosevelt, s, later, accomplishments, lippmann, stood, by, his, words, saying, that, i, will, maintain, to, my, dying, day, was, true, of, the, franklin, roosevelt, of, 1932, he, believed, his, judgment, was, an, accurate, summation, of, roosevelt, s, 1932, campaign, saying, it, was, 180, degrees, opposite, to, the, new, deal, the, fact, is, that, the, new, deal, was, wholly, improvised, after, roosevelt, was, elected, lippmann, was, an, early, and, influential, commentator, on, mass, culture, notable, not, for, criticizing, or, rejecting, mass, culture, entirely, but, discussing, how, it, could, be, worked, with, by, a, government, licensed, propaganda, machine, to, keep, democracy, functioning, in, his, first, book, on, the, subject, public, opinion, 1922, lippmann, said, that, mass, man, functioned, as, a, bewildered, herd, who, must, be, governed, by, a, specialized, class, whose, interests, reach, beyond, the, locality, the, elite, class, of, intellectuals, and, experts, were, to, be, a, machinery, of, knowledge, to, circumvent, the, primary, defect, of, democracy, the, impossible, ideal, of, the, omnicompetent, citizen, later, in, the, phantom, public, 1925, lippmann, recognized, that, the, class, of, experts, were, also, in, most, respects, outsiders, to, any, particular, problem, and, hence, not, capable, of, effective, action, philosopher, john, dewey, 1859, 1952, agreed, with, lippmann, s, assertions, that, the, modern, world, was, becoming, too, complex, for, every, citizen, to, grasp, all, its, aspects, but, dewey, unlike, lippmann, believed, that, the, public, a, composite, of, many, publics, within, society, could, form, a, great, community, that, could, become, educated, about, issues, come, to, judgments, and, arrive, at, solutions, to, societal, problems, in, 1943, george, seldes, described, lippmann, as, one, of, the, two, most, influential, columnists, in, the, united, states, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1950s, lippmann, became, even, more, skeptical, of, the, guiding, class, in, the, public, philosophy, 1955, which, took, almost, twenty, years, to, complete, he, presented, a, sophisticated, argument, that, intellectual, elites, were, undermining, the, framework, of, democracy, the, book, was, very, poorly, received, in, liberal, circles, the, walter, lippmann, house, at, harvard, university, which, houses, the, nieman, foundation, for, journalism, is, named, after, him, similarities, between, the, views, of, lippmann, and, gabriel, almond, produced, what, became, known, as, the, almond, lippmann, consensus, which, is, based, on, three, assumptions, french, philosopher, louis, rougier, convened, a, meeting, of, primarily, french, and, german, liberal, intellectuals, in, paris, in, august, 1938, to, discuss, the, ideas, put, forward, by, lippmann, in, his, work, the, good, society, 1937, they, named, the, meeting, after, lippmann, calling, it, the, colloque, walter, lippmann, the, meeting, is, often, considered, the, precursor, to, the, first, meeting, of, the, mont, p, lerin, society, convened, by, friedrich, von, hayek, in, 1947, at, both, meetings, discussions, centered, around, what, a, new, liberalism, or, neoliberalism, should, look, like, lippmann, was, married, twice, the, first, time, from, 1917, to, 1937, to, faye, albertson, 23, march,

social, gospel, movement, in, the, spirit, of, george, herron, during, his, studies, at, harvard, walter, often, visited, the, albertsons, estate, in, west, newbury, massachusetts, where, they, had,
