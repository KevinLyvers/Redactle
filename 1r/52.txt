script, portrayed, the, female, character, as, too, evil, and, insisted, that, it, was, not, representative, of, real, women, who, faced, marriage, breakdown, and, child, custody, battles, the, makers, agreed, with, her, and, the, script, was, revised, in, preparing, for, the, part, streep, spoke, to, her, own, mother, about, her, life, as, a, wife, with, a, career, and, frequented, the,

dialogue, in, two, key, scenes, despite, some, objection, from, hoffman, who, hated, her, guts, at, first, hoffman, and, producer, stanley, r, jaffe, later, spoke, of, streep, s, tirelessness, with, hoffman, commenting, she, s, extraordinarily, hard, working, to, the, extent, that, she, s, obsessive, i, think, that, she, thinks, about, nothing, else, but, what, she, s, doing, the, film, was, controversial, among, feminists, but, it, was, a, role, which, film, critic, stephen, farber, believed, displayed, streep, s, own, emotional, intensity, writing, that, she, was, one, of, the, rare, performers, who, can, imbue, the, most, routine, moments, with, a, hint, of, mystery, for, the, film, streep, won, both, the, golden, globe, award, and, the, academy, award, for, best, supporting,

referred, to, streep, as, the, production, s, one, wonder, but, questioned, why, she, devoted, so, much, energy, to, it, by, 1980, streep, had, progressed, to, leading, roles, in, films, she, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, newsweek, magazine, with, the, headline, a, star, for, the, 80s, jack, kroll, commented, there, s, a, sense, of, mystery, in, her, acting, she, doesn, t, simply, imitate, although, she, s, a, great, mimic, in, private, she, transmits, a, sense, of, danger, a, primal, unease, lying, just, below, the, surface, of, normal, behavior, streep, denounced, her, fervent, media, coverage, at, the, time, as, excessive, hype, the, story, within, a, story, drama, the, french, lieutenant, s, woman, 1981, was, streep, s, first, leading, role, the, film, paired, streep, with, jeremy, irons, as, contemporary, actors, telling, their, modern, story, as, well, as, the, victorian, era, drama, they, were, performing, streep, developed, an, english, accent, for, the, part, but, considered, herself, a, misfit, for, the, role, i, couldn, t, help, wishing, that, i, was, more, beautiful, a, new, york, magazine, article, commented, that, while, many, female, stars, of, the, past, had, cultivated, a, singular, identity, in, their, films, streep, was, a, chameleon, willing, to, play, any, type, of, role, streep, was, awarded, a, bafta, award, for, best, actress, in, a, leading, role, for, her, work, the, following, year, she, re, united, with, robert, benton, for, the, psychological, thriller, still, of, the, night, 1982, co, starring, roy, scheider, and, jessica, tandy, vincent, canby, writing, for, the, new, york, times, noted, that, the, film, was, an, homage, to, the, works, of, alfred, hitchcock, but, that, one, of, its, main, weaknesses, was, a, lack, of, chemistry, between, streep, and, scheider, concluding, that, streep, is, stunning, but, she, s, not, on, screen, anywhere, near, long, enough, greater, success, came, later, in, the, year, when, streep, starred, in, the, drama, sophie, s, choice, also, 1982, portraying, a, polish, survivor, of, auschwitz, caught, in, a, love, triangle, between, a, young, na, ve, writer, peter, macnicol, and, a, jewish, intellectual, kevin, kline, streep, s, emotional, dramatic, performance, and, her, apparent, mastery, of, a, polish, accent, drew, praise, william, styron, wrote, the, novel, with, ursula, andress, in, mind, for, the, role, of, sophie, but, streep, was, determined, to, get, the, role, streep, filmed, the, choice, scene, in, one, take, and, refused, to, do, it, again, finding, it, extremely, painful, and, emotionally, exhausting, that, scene, in, which, streep, is, ordered, by, an, ss, guard, at, auschwitz, to, choose, which, of, her, two, children, would, be, gassed, and, which, would, proceed, to, the, labor, camp, is, her, most, famous, scene, according, to, emma, brockes, of, the, guardian, who, wrote, in, 2006, it, s, classic, streep, the, kind, of, scene, that, makes, your, scalp, tighten, but, defter, in, a, way, is, her, handling, of, smaller, harder, to, grasp, emotions, among, several, acting, awards, streep, won, the, academy, award, for, best, actress, for, her, performance, and, her, characterization, was, voted, the, third, greatest, movie, performance, of, all, time, by, premiere, magazine, roger, ebert, said, of, her, delivery, streep, plays, the, brooklyn, scenes, with, an, enchanting, polish, american, accent, she, has, the, first, accent, i, ve, ever, wanted, to, hug, and, she, plays, the, flashbacks, in, subtitled, german, and, polish, there, is, hardly, an, emotion, that, streep, doesn, t, touch, in, this, movie, and, yet, we, re, never, aware, of, her, straining, this, is, one, of, the, most, astonishing, and, yet, one, of, the, most, unaffected, and, natural, performances, i, can, imagine, pauline, kael, on, the, contrary, called, the, film, an, infuriatingly, bad, movie, and, thought, that, streep, decorporealizes, herself, which, she, believed, explained, why, her, movie, heroines, don, t, seem, to, be, full, characters, and, why, there, are, no, incidental, joys, to, be, had, from, watching, her, in, 1983, streep, played, her, first, non, fictional, character, the, nuclear, whistleblower, and, labor, union, activist, karen, silkwood, who, died, in, a, suspicious, car, accident, while, investigating, alleged, wrongdoing, at, the, kerr, mcgee, plutonium, plant, in, mike, nichols, biographical, film, silkwood, streep, felt, a, personal, connection, to, silkwood, and, in, preparation, she, met, with, people, close, to, the, woman, and, in, doing, so, realized, that, each, person, saw, a, different, aspect, of, her, personality, she, said, i, didn, t, try, to, turn, myself, into, karen, i, just, tried, to, look, at, what, she, did, i, put, together, every, piece, of, information, i, could, find, about, her, what, i, finally, did, was, look, at, the, events, in, her, life, and, try, to, understand, her, from, the, inside, jack, kroll, of, newsweek, considered, streep, s, characterization, to, have, been, brilliant, while, silkwood, s, boyfriend, drew, stephens, expressed, approval, in, that, streep, had, played, karen, as, a, human, being, rather, than, a, myth, despite, karen, s, father, bill, thinking, that, streep, and, the, film, had, dumbed, his, daughter, down, pauline, kael, believed, that, streep, had, been, miscast, streep, next, played, opposite, robert, de, niro, in, the, romance, falling, in, love, 1984, which, was, poorly, received, and, portrayed, a, fighter, for, the, french, resistance, during, world, war, ii, in, the, british, drama, plenty, 1985, adapted, from, the, play, by, david, hare, for, the, latter, roger, ebert, wrote, that, she, conveyed, great, subtlety, it, is, hard, to, play, an, unbalanced, neurotic, self, destructive, woman, and, do, it, with, such, gentleness, and, charm, streep, creates, a, whole, character, around, a, woman, who, could, have, simply, been, a, catalogue, of, symptoms, in, 2008, molly, haskell, praised, streep, s, performance, in, plenty, believing, it, to, be, one, of, streep, s, most, difficult, and, ambiguous, films, and, most, feminist, role, longworth, considers, streep, s, next, release, out, of, africa, 1985, to, have, established, her, as, a, hollywood, superstar, in, the, film, streep, starred, as, the, danish, writer, karen, blixen, opposite, robert, redford, s, denys, finch, hatton, director, sydney, pollack, was, initially, dubious, about, streep, in, the, role, as, he, did, not, think, she, was, sexy, enough, and, had, considered, jane, seymour, for, the, part, pollack, recalls, that, streep, impressed, him, in, a, different, way, she, was, so, direct, so, honest, so, without, bullshit, there, was, no, shielding, between, her, and, me, streep, and, pollack, often, clashed, during, the, 101, day, shoot, in, kenya, particularly, over, blixen, s, voice, streep, had, spent, much, time, listening, to, tapes, of, blixen, and, began, speaking, in, an, old, fashioned, and, aristocratic, fashion, which, pollack, thought, excessive, a, significant, commercial, success, the, film, won, a, golden, globe, for, best, picture, it, also, earned, streep, another, academy, award, nomination, for, best, actress, and, the, film, ultimately, won, best, picture, film, critic, stanley, kauffmann, praised, her, performance, writing, meryl, streep, is, back, in, top, form, this, means, her, performance, in, out, of, africa, is, at, the, highest, level, of, acting, in, film,

with, her, unparalleled, ability, to, portray, a, wide, range, of, roles, and, attract, an, audience, that, has, only, grown, over, time, portraying, characters, who, embody, the, full, range, of, the, human, experience, in, january, 2017, viola, davis, presented, streep, with, the, cecil, b, demille, at, the, golden, globes, davis, stated, to, streep, you, make, me, proud, to, be, an, artist, in, her, acceptance, speech, streep, quoted, the, recently, departed, carrie, fisher, saying, take, your, broken, heart, and, make, it, into, art, vanity, fair, commented, that, it, s, hard, to, imagine, that, there, was, a, time, before, meryl, streep, was, the, greatest, living, actress, emma, brockes, of, the, guardian, notes, that, despite, streep, s, being, one, of, the, most, famous, actresses, in, the, world, it, is, strangely, hard, to, pin, an, image, on, streep, in, a, career, where, she, has, laboured, to, establish, herself, as, an, actor, whose, roots, lie, in, ordinary, life, despite, her, success, streep, has, always, been, modest, about, her, own, acting, and, achievements, in, cinema, she, has, stated, that, she, has, no, particular, method, when, it, comes, to, acting, learning, from, the, days, of, her, early, studies, that, she, cannot, articulate, her, practice, she, said, in, 1987, i, have, a, smattering, of, things, i, ve, learned, from, different, teachers, but, nothing, i, can, put, into, a, valise, and, open, it, up, and, say, now, which, one, would, you, like, nothing, i, can, count, on, and, that, makes, it, more, dangerous, but, then, the, danger, makes, it, more, exciting, she, has, stated, that, her, ideal, director, is, one, who, gives, her, complete, artistic, control, allowing, her, to, have, a, degree, of, improvisation, and, to, learn, from, her, mistakes, women, are, better, at, acting, than, men, why, because, we, have, to, be, if, successfully, convincing, somebody, bigger, than, you, of, something, he, doesn, t, know, is, a, survival, skill, this, is, how, women, have, survived, through, the, millennia, pretending, is, not, just, play, pretending, is, imagined, possibility, pretending, or, acting, is, a, very, valuable, life, skill, and, we, all, do, it, all, the, time, streep, on, acting, karina, longworth, notes, how, external, streep, s, performances, are, chameleonic, in, her, impersonation, of, characters, subsuming, herself, into, them, rather, than, personifying, them, in, her, early, roles, such, as, manhattan, and, kramer, vs, kramer, she, was, compared, to, both, diane, keaton, and, jill, clayburgh, in, that, her, characters, were, unsympathetic, which, streep, has, attributed, to, the, tendency, to, be, drawn, to, playing, women, who, are, difficult, to, like, and, lack, empathy, streep, has, stated, that, many, consider, her, to, be, a, technical, actor, but, she, professed, that, it, comes, down, to, her, love, of, reading, the, initial, script, adding, i, come, ready, and, i, don, t, want, to, screw, around, and, waste, the, first, 10, takes, on, adjusting, lighting, and, everybody, else, getting, comfortable, mike, nichols, who, directed, streep, in, silkwood, heartburn, postcards, from, the, edge, and, angels, in, america, praised, streep, s, ability, to, transform, herself, into, her, characters, remarking, that, in, every, role, she, becomes, a, totally, new, human, being, as, she, becomes, the, person, she, is, portraying, the, other, performers, begin, to, react, to, her, as, if, she, were, that, person, he, said, that, directing, her, is, so, much, like, falling, in, love, that, it, has, the, characteristics, of, a, time, which, you, remember, as, magical, but, which, is, shrouded, in, mystery, he, also, noted, that, streep, s, acting, ability, had, a, profound, impact, on, her, co, stars, and, that, one, could, improve, by, 1000, purely, by, watching, her, longworth, believes, that, in, nearly, every, film, streep, has, sly, infused, a, feminist, point, of, view, in, her, portrayals, however, film, critic, molly, haskell, has, stated, none, of, her, heroines, are, feminist, strictly, speaking, yet, they, uncannily, embody, various, crosscurrents, of, experience, in, the, last, twenty, years, as, women, have, re, defined, themselves, against, the, background, of, the, women, s, movement, streep, is, well, known, for, her, ability, to, imitate, a, wide, range, of, accents, from, danish, in, out, of, africa, 1985, to, british, received, pronunciation, in, the, french, lieutenant, s, woman, 1981, plenty, 1985,

the, beatles, and, bob, dylan, and, she, learned, a, lot, about, how, to, use, her, voice, her, instrument, by, listening, to, barbra, streisand, s, albums, in, the, film, evil, angels, 1988, released, in, the, u, s, as, a, cry, in, the, dark, in, which, she, portrays, a, new, zealand, transplant, to, australia, streep, developed, a, hybrid, of, australian, and, new, zealand, english, her,

lessons, to, change, her, pitch, pronunciation, and, delivery, streep, has, commented, that, using, accents, as, part, of, her, acting, is, a, technique, she, views, as, an, obvious, requirement, in, her, portrayal, of, a, character, when, questioned, in, belfast, as, to, how, she, reproduces, different, accents, streep, replied, in, a, reportedly, perfect, belfast, accent, i, listen, politically,

speech, that, implicitly, criticized, president, elect, donald, trump, she, argued, that, trump, had, a, very, strong, platform, and, used, it, inappropriately, to, mock, a, disabled, reporter, serge, f, kovaleski, whom, in, her, words, trump, outranked, in, privilege, power, and, the, capacity, to, fight, back, trump, responded, by, calling, streep, one, of, the, most, over, rated, actresses, in,
