shaka, kasenzangakhona, c, 1787, 24, september, 1828, also, known, as, shaka, zulu, zulu, pronunciation, and, sigidi, kasenzangakhona, was, the, king, of, the, zulu, kingdom, from, 1816, to, 1828, one, of, the, most, influential, monarchs, of, the, zulu, he, ordered, wide, reaching, reforms, that, reorganized, the, military, into, a, formidable, force, king, shaka, was, born, in, the, lunar, month, of, untulikazi, july, in, the, year, 1787, in, mthonjaneni, kwazulu, natal, province, south, africa, the, son, of, the, zulu, king, senzankakhona, kajama, he, was, spurned, as, an, illegitimate, son, shaka, spent, part, of, his, childhood, in, his, mother, s, settlements, where, he, was, initiated, into, an, ibutho, lempi, fighting, unit, regiment, serving, as, a, warrior, under, inkosi, dingiswayo, king, shaka, further, refined, the, ibutho, military, system, with, the, mthethwa, paramountcy, s, support, over, the, next, several, years, he, forged, alliances, with, his, smaller, neighbours, to, counter, ndwandwe, raids, from, the, north, the, initial, zulu, maneuvers, were, primarily, defensive, as, king, shaka, preferred, to, apply, pressure, diplomatically, with, an, occasional, strategic, assassination, his, reforms, of, local, society, built, on, existing, structures, although, he, preferred, social, and, propagandistic, political, methods, he, also, engaged, in, a, number, of, battles, king, shaka, s, reign, coincided, with, the, start, of, the, mfecane, difaqane, upheaval, or, crushing, a, period, of, devastating, warfare, and, chaos, in, southern, africa, between, 1815, and, 1840, that, depopulated, the, region, his, role, in, the, mfecane, difaqane, is, highly, controversial, he, was, ultimately, assassinated, by, his, half, brothers, king, dingane, and, prince, mhlangana, and, mbopha, kasithayi, shaka, roughly, translated, as, intestinal, beetle, was, born, to, the, zulu, king, he, was, the, eldest, of, many, sons, but, was, considered, to, be, a, bastard, child, and, was, sent, away, to, live, in, another, neighboring, tribe, known, as, the, elangeni, where, his, mother, was, originally, from, leaving, his, half, brother, to, rule, the, zulu, kingdom, at, the, time, the, zulu, were, a, regional, tribe, relying, on, pastoral, livestock, maize, and, milk, when, shaka, reached, a, suitable, age, he, and, his, mother, were, sent, to, the, mthethwa, clan, the, most, powerful, regional, tribe, there, he, matured, and, served, as, a, warrior, under, jobe, and, then, for, dingiswayo, a, respected, warrior, and, chief, of, the, clan, when, inkosi, dingiswayo, discovered, shaka, was, royalty, he, put, him, in, charge, of, a, regiment, helping, to, develop, shaka, s, military, tactics, and, strategy, after, inkosi, zwide, murdered, dingiswayo, shaka, sought, to, avenge, his, death, during, that, encounter, zwide, s, mother, ntombazi, a, sangoma, was, killed, by, shaka, shaka, chose, a, particularly, gruesome, revenge, on, her, by, locking, her, in, a, house, with, jackals, or, hyenas, inside, they, devoured, her, and, in, the, morning, shaka, burned, the, house, to, the, ground, shaka, continued, his, pursuit, of, zwide, it, was, not, until, around, 1825, that, the, two, military, leaders, met, in, the, vicinity, of, pongola, near, the, present, day, border, of, mpumalanga, a, province, in, south, africa, shaka, was, victorious, in, battle, although, his, forces, sustained, heavy, casualties, including, his, military, commander, mgobhozi, ovela, entabeni, already, at, this, time, shaka, had, grown, famous, for, his, use, of, the, short, stabbing, spear, it, was, deadly, and, easy, to, thrust, whereas, before, tribesmen, barely, tried, to, customize, or, improve, their, weapons, shaka, s, innovative, tactics, among, them, the, bull, horn, tactic, devastated, zwide, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, gqokli, hill, in, his, initial, years, shaka, had, neither, the, influence, nor, reputation, to, compel, any, but, the, smallest, of, groups, to, join, him, and, upon, dingiswayo, s, death, he, moved, southwards, across, the, thukela, river, establishing, his, capital, bulawayo, in, qwabe, territory, he, never, returned, to, the, traditional, zulu, heartland, in, qwabe, shaka, may, have, intervened, in, an, existing, succession, dispute, to, help, his, own, choice, nqetho, into, power, as, shaka, became, more, respected, by, his, people, he, was, able, to, spread, his, ideas, along, with, greater, ease, using, his, background, as, a, soldier, shaka, taught, the, zulus, that, the, most, effective, way, of, gaining, power, quickly, was, by, conquering, and, controlling, other, tribes, his, teachings, greatly, influenced, the, social, outlook, of, the, zulus, the, zulu, tribe, soon, developed, a, warrior, outlook, which, shaka, used, to, his, advantage, shaka, s, hegemony, was, primarily, based, on, military, might, smashing, rivals, and, incorporating, scattered, remnants, into, his, own, army, he, supplemented, this, with, a, mixture, of, diplomacy, and, patronage, incorporating, friendly, chieftains, including, zihlandlo, of, the, mkhize, jobe, of, the, sithole, and, mathubane, of, the, thuli, these, people, were, never, defeated, in, battle, by, the, zulus, they, did, not, have, to, be, shaka, won, them, over, with, subtler, tactics, such, as, patronage, and, reward, as, for, the, ruling, of, qwabe, they, began, re, inventing, their, genealogies, to, give, the, impression, that, qwabe, and, zulu, were, closely, related, i, e, as, nguni, in, the, past, in, this, way, a, greater, sense, of, cohesion, was, created, though, it, never, became, complete, as, subsequent, civil, wars, attest, shaka, still, recognised, dingiswayo, and, his, larger, mthethwa, clan, as, overlord, after, he, returned, to, the, zulu, land, but, some, years, later, dingiswayo, was, ambushed, by, zwide, s, ndwandwe, and, killed, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, shaka, betrayed, dingiswayo, the, core, zulus, had, to, retreat, before, several, ndwandwe, incursions, the, ndwandwe, was, clearly, the, most, aggressive, grouping, in, the, sub, region, shaka, was, able, to, form, an, alliance, with, the, leaders, of, the, mthethwa, clan, and, was, able, to, establish, himself, amongst, the, qwabe, after, phakathwayo, was, overthrown, with, relative, ease, with, qwabe, hlubi, and, mkhize, support, shaka, was, finally, able, to, summon, a, force, capable, of, resisting, the, ndwandwe, of, the, nxumalo, clan, shaka, s, first, major, battle, against, zwide, of, the, ndwandwe, was, the, battle, of, gqokli, hill, on, the, mfolozi, river, shaka, s, troops, maintained, a, strong, position, on, the, crest, of, the, hill, a, frontal, assault, by, their, opponents, failed, to, dislodge, them, and, shaka, sealed, the, victory, by, sending, his, reserve, forces, in, a, sweep, around, the, hill, to, attack, the, enemy, s, rear, losses, were, high, overall, but, the, efficiency, of, the, new, shakan, innovations, was, proven, it, is, probable, that, over, time, the, zulus, were, able, to, hone, and, improve, their, encirclement, tactics, another, decisive, battle, eventually, took, place, on, the, mhlatuze, river, at, the, confluence, with, the, mvuzane, stream, in, the, two, day, running, battle, the, zulus, inflicted, a, resounding, defeat, on, their, opponents, shaka, then, led, a, fresh, reserve, some, 110, kilometres, 70, mi, to, the, royal, kraal, of, zwide, ruler, of, the, ndwandwe, and, destroyed, it, zwide, himself, escaped, with, a, handful, of, followers, before, falling, afoul, of, a, chieftain, named, mjanji, ruler, of, a, babelu, clan, he, died, in, mysterious, circumstances, soon, afterwards, zwide, s, general, soshangane, of, the, shangaan, moved, north, towards, what, is, now, mozambique, to, inflict, further, damage, on, less, resistant, foes, and, take, advantage, of, slaving, opportunities, obliging, portuguese, traders, to, pay, tribute, shaka, later, had, to, contend, again, with, zwide, s, son, sikhunyane, in, 1826, shaka, granted, permission, to, europeans, to, enter, zulu, territory, on, rare, occasions, in, the, mid, 1820s, henry, francis, fynn, provided, medical, treatment, to, the, king, after, an, assassination, attempt, by, a, rival, tribe, member, hidden, in, a, crowd, to, show, his, gratitude, shaka, permitted, european, settlers, to, enter, and, operate, in, the, zulu, kingdom, shaka, observed, several, demonstrations, of, european, technology, and, knowledge, but, he, held, that, the, zulu, way, was, superior, to, that, of, the, foreigners, dingane, and, mhlangana, shaka, s, half, brothers, appeared, to, have, made, at, least, two, attempts, to, assassinate, shaka, before, they, succeeded, with, support, from, the, mpondo, elements, and, some, disaffected, iziyendane, people, shaka, had, made, enough, enemies, among, his, own, people, to, hasten, his, demise, it, came, relatively, quickly, after, the, death, of, his, mother, nandi, in, october, 1827, and, the, devastation, caused, by, shaka, s, subsequent, erratic, behavior, according, to, donald, morris, shaka, ordered, that, no, crops, should, be, planted, during, the, following, year, of, mourning, no, milk, the, basis, of, the, zulu, diet, at, the, time, was, to, be, used, and, any, woman, who, became, pregnant, was, to, be, killed, along, with, her, husband, at, least, 7, 000, people, who, were, deemed, to, be, insufficiently, grief, stricken, were, executed, although, the, killing, was, not, restricted, to, humans, cows, were, slaughtered, so, that, their, calves, would, know, what, losing, a, mother, felt, like, shaka, was, killed, by, three, assassins, sometime, in, 1828, september, is, the, most, frequently, cited, date, when, almost, all, available, zulu, manpower, had, been, sent, on, yet, another, mass, sweep, to, the, north, this, left, the, royal, kraal, critically, lacking, in, protection, it, was, all, the, conspirators, needed, an, induna, named, mbopa, created, a, diversion, and, dingane, and, mhlangana, struck, the, fatal, blows, shaka, s, corpse, was, dumped, by, his, assassins, in, an, empty, grain, pit, which, was, then, filled, with, stones, and, mud, the, exact, location, is, unknown, a, monument, was, built, at, one, alleged, site, historian, donald, morris, holds, that, the, true, site, is, somewhere, on, couper, street, in, the, village, of, stanger, in, kwazulu, natal, south, africa, dingane, assumed, power, and, embarked, on, an, extensive, purge, of, pro, shaka, elements, and, chieftains, over, the, course, of, several, years, in, order, to, secure, his, position, the, initial, problem, dingane, faced, was, maintaining, the, loyalty, of, the, zulu, fighting, regiments, he, set, up, his, main, residence, at, mgungundlovu, and, established, his, authority, over, the, zulu, kingdom, dingane, ruled, for, some, twelve, years, during, which, time, he, fought, disastrously, against, the, voortrekkers, and, against, another, half, brother, mpande, who, with, boer, and, british, support, took, over, the, zulu, leadership, in, 1840, ruling, for, some, 30, years, some, older, histories, have, doubted, the, military, and, social, innovations, customarily, attributed, to, shaka, denying, them, outright, or, attributing, them, variously, to, european, influences, more, modern, researchers, argue, that, such, explanations, fall, short, and, that, the, general, zulu, culture, which, included, other, tribes, and, clans, contained, a, number, of, practices, that, shaka, could, have, drawn, on, to, fulfill, his, objectives, whether, in, raiding, conquest, or, hegemony, some, of, these, practices, are, shown, below, shaka, is, often, said, to, have, been, dissatisfied, with, the, long, throwing, assegai, and, is, credited, with, having, introduced, a, new, variant, of, the, weapon, the, iklwa, a, short, stabbing, spear, with, a, long, broad, sword, like, spearhead, although, he, is, credited, with, introducing, the, ilkwa, to, his, people, shaka, likely, did, not, invent, it, himself, he, most, likely, outsourced, it, from, nzama, who, later, had, a, feud, with, him, because, he, did, not, want, to, pay, for, the, spears, according, to, zulu, scholar, john, laband, shaka, insisted, that, his, warriors, train, with, the, weapon, which, gave, them, a, terrifying, advantage, over, opponents, who, clung, to, the, traditional, practice, of, throwing, their, spears, and, avoiding, hand, to, hand, conflict, the, throwing, spear, was, not, discarded, but, used, as, an, initial, missile, weapon, before, close, contact, with, the, enemy, when, the, shorter, stabbing, spear, was, used, in, hand, to, hand, combat, it, is, also, supposed, that, shaka, introduced, a, larger, heavier, version, of, the, nguni, shield, furthermore, it, is, believed, that, he, taught, his, warriors, how, to, use, the, shield, s, left, side, to, hook, the, enemy, s, shield, to, the, right, exposing, the, enemy, s, ribs, for, a, fatal, spear, stab, in, shaka, s, time, these, cowhide, shields, were, supplied, by, the, king, and, they, remained, the, king, s, property, different, coloured, shields, distinguished, different, amabutho, within, shaka, s, army, some, had, black, shields, others, used, white, shields, with, black, spots, and, some, had, white, shields, with, brown, spots, while, others, used, pure, brown, or, white, shields, the, story, that, sandals, were, discarded, to, toughen, the, feet, of, zulu, warriors, has, been, noted, in, various, military, accounts, such, as, the, washing, of, the, spears, like, lions, they, fought, and, anatomy, of, the, zulu, army, implementation, was, typically, blunt, those, who, objected, to, going, without, sandals, were, simply, killed, shaka, drilled, his, troops, frequently, in, forced, marches, that, sometimes, covered, more, than, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, a, day, in, a, fast, trot, over, hot, rocky, terrain, he, also, drilled, the, troops, to, carry, out, encirclement, tactics, historian, john, laband, dismisses, these, stories, as, myth, writing, what, are, we, to, make, then, of, fynn, s, statement, that, once, the, zulu, army, reached, hard, and, stony, ground, in, 1826, shaka, ordered, sandals, of, ox, hide, to, be, made, for, himself, laband, also, dismissed, the, idea, of, an, 80, kilometre, 50, mi, march, in, a, single, day, as, ridiculous, he, further, claims, that, even, though, these, stories, have, been, repeated, by, astonished, and, admiring, white, commentators, the, zulu, army, covered, no, more, than, 19, kilometres, a, day, and, usually, went, only, about, 14, kilometres, furthermore, zulus, under, shaka, sometimes, advanced, more, slowly, they, spent, two, whole, days, recuperating, in, one, instance, and, on, another, they, rested, for, a, day, and, two, nights, before, pursuing, their, enemy, several, other, historians, of, the, zulu, and, the, zulu, military, system, however, affirm, the, mobility, rate, of, up, to, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, per, day, boys, aged, six, and, over, joined, shaka, s, force, as, apprentice, warriors, udibi, and, served, as, carriers, of, rations, supplies, such, as, cooking, pots, and, sleeping, mats, and, extra, weapons, until, they, joined, the, main, ranks, it, is, sometimes, held, that, such, support, was, used, more, for, very, light, forces, designed, to, extract, tribute, in, cattle, and, slaves, from, neighbouring, groups, nevertheless, the, concept, of, light, forces, is, questionable, the, fast, moving, zulu, raiding, party, or, ibutho, lempi, on, a, mission, invariably, travelled, light, driving, cattle, as, provisions, on, the, hoof, and, were, not, weighed, down, with, heavy, weapons, and, supply, packs, age, grade, groupings, of, various, sorts, were, common, in, the, bantu, culture, of, the, day, and, indeed, are, still, important, in, much, of, africa, age, grades, were, responsible, for, a, variety, of, activities, from, guarding, the, camp, to, cattle, herding, to, certain, rituals, and, ceremonies, shaka, organised, various, grades, into, regiments, and, quartered, them, in, special, military, kraals, with, regiments, having, their, own, distinctive, names, and, insignia, the, regimental, system, clearly, built, on, existing, tribal, cultural, elements, that, could, be, adapted, and, shaped, to, fit, an, expansionist, agenda, most, historians, credit, shaka, with, initial, development, of, the, famous, bull, horn, formation, it, was, composed, of, three, elements, shaka, created, ruthless, determination, in, his, army, by, instilling, in, his, warriors, the, knowledge, of, what, would, happen, if, their, courage, failed, them, in, battle, or, their, regiments, were, defeated, a, brutal, fate, awaited, them, and, their, families, if, they, did, not, perform, well, in, combat, h, rider, haggard, learned, about, shaka, s, methods, from, his, nephew, and, late, 19th, century, zulu, king, cetshwayo, kampande, as, shaka, conquered, a, tribe, he, enrolled, its, remnants, in, his, army, so, that, they, might, in, their, turn, help, to, conquer, others, he, armed, his, regiments, with, the, short, stabbing, iklwa, instead, of, the, throwing, assegai, which, they, had, been, accustomed, to, use, and, kept, them, subject, to, an, iron, discipline, if, a, man, was, observed, to, show, the, slightest, hesitation, about, coming, to, close, quarters, with, the, enemy, he, was, executed, as, soon, as, the, fight, was, over, if, a, regiment, had, the, misfortune, to, be, defeated, whether, by, its, own, fault, or, not, it, would, on, its, return, to, headquarters, find, that, a, goodly, proportion, of, the, wives, and, children, belonging, to, it, had, been, beaten, to, death, on, shaka, s, orders, and, that, he, was, waiting, their, arrival, to, complete, his, vengeance, by, dashing, out, their, brains, the, result, was, that, though, shaka, s, armies, were, occasionally, defeated, they, were, rarely, annihilated, and, they, never, ran, away, the, expanding, zulu, power, inevitably, clashed, with, european, hegemony, in, the, decades, after, shaka, s, death, in, fact, european, travellers, to, shaka, s, kingdom, demonstrated, advanced, technology, such, as, firearms, and, writing, but, the, zulu, monarch, was, less, than, convinced, there, was, no, need, to, record, messages, he, held, since, his, messengers, stood, under, penalty, of, death, should, they, bear, inaccurate, tidings, as, for, firearms, shaka, acknowledged, their, utility, as, missile, weapons, after, seeing, muzzle, loaders, demonstrated, but, he, argued, that, in, the, time, a, gunman, took, to, reload, he, would, be, swamped, by, charging, spear, wielding, warriors, the, first, major, clash, after, shaka, s, death, took, place, under, his, successor, dingane, against, expanding, european, voortrekkers, from, the, cape, initial, zulu, success, rested, on, fast, moving, surprise, attacks, and, ambushes, but, the, voortrekkers, recovered, and, dealt, the, zulu, a, severe, defeat, from, their, fortified, wagon, laager, at, the, battle, of, blood, river, the, second, major, clash, was, against, the, british, during, 1879, once, again, most, zulu, successes, rested, on, their, mobility, ability, to, screen, their, forces, and, to, close, when, their, opponents, were, unfavourably, deployed, their, major, victory, at, the, battle, of, isandlwana, was, the, most, prominent, one, but, they, also, forced, back, a, british, column, at, the, battle, of, hlobane, by, deploying, fast, moving, regiments, over, a, wide, area, of, rugged, ravines, and, gullies, and, attacking, the, british, who, were, forced, into, a, rapid, disorderly, fighting, retreat, back, to, the, town, of, kambula, a, number, of, historians, argue, that, shaka, changed, the, nature, of, warfare, in, southern, africa, from, a, ritualised, exchange, of, taunts, with, minimal, loss, of, life, into, a, true, method, of, subjugation, by, wholesale, slaughter, others, dispute, this, characterization, a, number, of, writers, focus, on, shaka, s, military, innovations, such, as, the, iklwa, the, zulu, thrusting, spear, and, the, buffalo, horns, formation, this, combination, has, been, compared, to, the, standardisation, supposedly, implemented, by, the, reorganised, roman, legions, under, marius, combined, with, shaka, s, buffalo, horns, attack, formation, for, surrounding, and, annihilating, enemy, forces, the, zulu, combination, of, iklwa, and, shield, similar, to, the, roman, legionaries, use, of, gladius, and, scutum, was, devastating, by, the, time, of, shaka, s, assassination, in, 1828, it, had, made, the, zulu, kingdom, the, greatest, power, in, southern, africa, and, a, force, to, be, reckoned, with, even, against, britain, s, modern, army, in, 1879, much, controversy, still, surrounds, the, character, methods, and, activities, of, the, zulu, king, from, a, military, standpoint, historian, john, keegan, notes, exaggerations, and, myths, that, surround, shaka, but, nevertheless, maintains, fanciful, commentators, called, him, shaka, the, black, napoleon, and, allowing, for, different, societies, and, customs, the, comparison, is, apt, shaka, is, without, doubt, the, greatest, commander, to, have, come, out, of, africa, some, scholars, hold, that, popular, depictions, of, shaka, as, a, suddenly, appearing, genius, creating, innovation, are, overstated, and, that, to, the, contrary, shaka, was, a, borrower, and, imitator, of, indigenous, methods, customs, and, even, ruler, lineages, already, in, place, they, also, argue, that, shaka, s, line, was, relatively, short, lived, and, receives, undue, attention, compared, to, other, longer, established, lines, and, rulers, in, the, region, it, seems, much, more, likely, that, shaka, seeking, to, build, the, power, of, a, previously, insignificant, chiefdom, drew, on, an, existing, heritage, of, statecraft, known, to, his, immediate, neighbors, j, h, soga, implied, as, much, when, he, used, genealogical, evidence, to, argue, that, the, zulu, were, an, upstart, group, inferior, in, dignity, and, distinction, to, established, chiefdoms, in, their, region, for, example, the, hlubi, ndwandwe, and, dlamini, lines, using, different, informants, and, genealogical, charts, a, t, bryant, arrived, at, similar, conclusions, the, zulu, line, a, royal, house, of, doubtful, pedigree, was, very, short, in, comparison, to, the, langene, ndwandwe, swazi, and, hlubi, lines, using, his, standard, formula, of, eighteen, years, per, reign, bryant, calculated, that, the, swazi, ndwandwe, and, hlubi, lines, could, be, traced, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, fifteenth, century, while, the, eponymous, chief, zulu, had, died, at, the, beginning, of, the, eighteenth, century, shaka, s, triumphs, did, not, succeed, in, obliterating, or, diminishing, the, memories, of, his, better, born, rivals, the, hypothesis, that, several, states, of, a, new, kind, arose, about, the, same, time, does, not, take, account, of, the, contrast, between, the, short, line, of, shaka, and, the, long, pedigrees, of, his, most, important, opponents, especially, the, coalition, grouped, around, his, deadly, enemy, zwide, d, 1822, the, founders, of, the, states, which, omer, cooper, called, zulu, type, states, including, the, ndebele, the, gasa, the, ngoni, and, the, swazi, had, all, been, closely, associated, with, zwide, instead, of, hypothesizing, that, they, all, chose, to, imitate, shaka, it, is, easier, to, imagine, that, he, modeled, his, state, on, theirs, and, as, they, stemmed, from, ancient, families, it, is, entirely, possible, that, states, of, that, type, existed, in, a, more, remote, past, soga, and, bryant, related, each, of, them, to, a, larger, grouping, they, called, mho, scholarship, in, recent, years, has, revised, views, of, the, sources, on, shaka, s, reign, the, earliest, are, two, eyewitness, accounts, written, by, european, adventurer, traders, who, met, shaka, during, the, last, four, years, of, his, reign, nathaniel, isaacs, published, his, travels, and, adventures, in, eastern, africa, in, 1836, creating, a, picture, of, shaka, as, a, degenerate, and, pathological, monster, which, survives, in, modified, forms, to, this, day, isaacs, was, aided, in, this, by, henry, francis, fynn, whose, diary, actually, a, rewritten, collage, of, various, papers, was, edited, by, james, stuart, only, in, 1950, their, accounts, may, be, balanced, by, the, rich, resource, of, oral, histories, collected, around, 1900, by, the, same, james, stuart, now, published, in, six, volumes, as, the, james, stuart, archive, stuart, s, early, 20th, century, work, was, continued, by, d, mck, malcolm, in, 1950, these, and, other, sources, such, as, a, t, bryant, gives, us, a, more, zulu, centred, picture, most, popular, accounts, are, based, on, e, a, ritter, s, novel, shaka, zulu, 1955, a, potboiling, romance, that, was, re, edited, into, something, more, closely, resembling, a, history, john, wright, history, professor, at, university, of, kwazulu, natal, pietermaritzburg, julian, cobbing, and, dan, wylie, rhodes, university, grahamstown, are, among, a, number, of, writers, who, have, modified, these, stories, various, modern, historians, writing, on, shaka, and, the, zulu, point, to, the, uncertain, nature, of, fynn, and, isaac, s, accounts, of, shaka, s, reign, a, general, reference, work, in, the, field, is, donald, morris, s, the, washing, of, the, spears, which, notes, that, the, sources, as, a, whole, for, this, historical, era, are, not, the, best, morris, references, a, large, number, of, sources, including, stuart, and, a, t, bryant, s, olden, times, in, zululand, and, natal, which, is, based, on, four, decades, of, interviews, of, tribal, sources, after, sifting, through, these, sources, and, noting, their, strengths, and, weaknesses, morris, generally, credits, shaka, with, a, large, number, of, military, and, social, innovations, this, is, the, general, consensus, in, the, field, a, 1998, study, by, historian, carolyn, hamilton, summarizes, much, of, the, scholarship, on, shaka, towards, the, dawn, of, the, 21st, century, in, areas, ranging, from, ideology, politics, and, culture, to, the, use, of, his, name, and, image, in, a, popular, south, african, theme, park, shakaland, it, argues, that, in, many, ways, the, image, of, shaka, has, been, invented, in, the, modern, era, according, to, whatever, agenda, persons, hold, this, imagining, of, shaka, it, is, held, should, be, balanced, by, a, sober, view, of, the, historical, record, and, allow, greater, scope, for, the, contributions, of, indigenous, african, discourse, military, historians, of, the, zulu, war, describe, zulu, fighting, methods, and, tactics, including, authors, ian, knight, and, robert, edgerton, general, histories, of, southern, africa, include, noel, mostert, s, frontiers, and, a, detailed, account, of, the, results, from, the, zulu, expansion, j, d, omer, cooper, s, the, zulu, aftermath, which, advances, the, traditional, mfecane, difaqane, theory, the, increased, military, efficiency, led, to, more, and, more, clans, being, incorporated, into, shaka, s, zulu, empire, while, other, tribes, moved, away, to, be, out, of, range, of, shaka, s, impis, the, ripple, effect, caused, by, these, mass, migrations, would, become, known, though, only, in, the, twentieth, century, as, the, mfecane, difaqane, annihilation, shaka, s, army, set, out, on, a, massive, programme, of, expansion, killing, or, enslaving, those, who, resisted, in, the, territories, he, conquered, his, impis, warrior, regiments, were, rigorously, disciplined, failure, in, battle, meant, death, at, the, time, of, his, death, shaka, ruled, over, 250, 000, people, and, could, muster, more, than, 50, 000, warriors, his, 10, year, long, kingship, resulted, in, a, massive, number, of, deaths, mostly, due, to, the, disruptions, the, zulu, caused, in, neighbouring, tribes, although, the, exact, death, toll, is, a, matter, of, scholarly, dispute, further, unquantifiable, deaths, occurred, during, mass, tribal, migrations, to, escape, his, armies, the, mfecane, produced, mzilikazi, of, the, khumalo, a, general, of, shaka, s, he, fled, shaka, s, employ, and, in, turn, conquered, an, empire, in, zimbabwe, after, clashing, with, european, groups, like, the, boers, the, settling, of, mzilikazi, s, people, the, amandebele, or, matabele, in, the, south, of, zimbabwe, with, the, concomitant, driving, of, the, mashona, into, the, north, caused, a, tribal, conflict, that, still, resonates, today, other, notable, figures, to, arise, from, the, mfecane, difaqane, include, soshangane, who, expanded, from, the, zulu, area, into, what, is, now, mozambique, and, zwangendaba, the, theory, of, the, mfecane, holds, that, the, aggressive, expansion, of, shaka, s, armies, caused, a, brutal, chain, reaction, across, the, southern, areas, of, the, continent, as, dispossessed, tribe, after, tribe, turned, on, their, neighbours, in, a, deadly, cycle, of, fight, and, conquest, some, scholars, contend, that, this, theory, must, be, treated, with, caution, as, it, generally, neglects, several, other, factors, such, as, the, impact, of, european, encroachment, slave, trading, and, expansion, in, that, area, of, southern, africa, around, the, same, time, normal, estimates, for, the, death, toll, range, from, 1, million, to, 2, million, these, numbers, are, however, controversial, according, to, julian, cobbing, the, development, of, the, view, that, shaka, was, the, monster, responsible, for, the, devastation, is, based, on, the, need, of, apartheid, era, historians, to, justify, the, apartheid, regime, s, racist, policies, other, scholars, acknowledge, distortion, of, the, historical, record, by, apartheid, supporters, and, shady, european, traders, seeking, to, cover, their, tracks, but, dispute, the, revisionist, approach, noting, that, stories, of, cannibalism, raiding, burning, of, villages, or, mass, slaughter, were, not, developed, out, of, thin, air, but, based, on, the, clearly, documented, accounts, of, hundreds, of, black, victims, and, refugees, confirmation, of, such, accounts, can, also, be, seen, in, modern, archaeology, of, the, village, of, lepalong, an, entire, settlement, built, underground, to, shelter, remnants, of, the, kwena, people, from, 1827, to, 1836, against, the, tide, of, disruption, that, engulfed, the, region, during, shakan, times, william, rubinstein, wrote, that, western, guilt, over, colonialism, have, also, accounted, for, much, of, this, distortion, of, what, pre, literate, societies, actually, were, like, as, does, the, wish, to, avoid, anything, which, smacks, of, racism, even, when, this, means, distorting, the, actual, and, often, appalling, facts, of, life, in, many, pre, literate, societies, rubinstein, also, notes, one, element, in, shaka, s, destruction, was, to, create, a, vast, artificial, desert, around, his, domain, to, make, the, destruction, complete, organized, bands, of, zulu, murderers, regularly, patrolled, the, waste, hunting, for, any, stray, men, and, running, them, down, like, wild, pig, an, area, 200, miles, to, the, north, of, the, center, of, the, state, 300, miles, to, the, west, and, 500, miles, to, the, south, was, ravaged, and, depopulated, south, african, historian, dan, wylie, has, expressed, skepticism, of, the, portrayal, of, shaka, as, a, pathological, monster, destroying, everything, within, reach, he, argues, that, attempts, to, distort, his, life, and, image, have, been, systematic, beginning, with, the, first, european, visitors, to, his, kingdom, one, visitor, nathaniel, isaacs, wrote, to, henry, fynn, a, white, adventurer, trader, and, quasi, local, chieftain, fynn, according, to, wylie, complied, with, the, request, and, wylie, notes, that, he, had, an, additional, motive, to, distort, shaka, s, image, he, applied, for, a, huge, grant, of, land, an, area, allegedly, depopulated, by, shaka, s, savagery, michal, lesniewski, has, criticised, wylie, for, some, of, his, attempts, to, revise, western, thinking, about, shaka, though, much, remains, unknown, about, shaka, s, personal, appearance, sources, tend, to, agree, he, had, a, strong, muscular, body, he, was, tall, and, his, skin, tone, was, dark, brown, shaka, s, enemies, described, him, as, ugly, in, some, respects, he, had, a, big, nose, according, to, baleka, of, the, qwabe, as, told, by, her, father, he, also, had, two, prominent, front, teeth, her, father, also, told, baleka, that, shaka, spoke, as, though, his, tongue, were, too, big, for, his, mouth, many, said, that, he, spoke, with, a, speech, impediment, there, is, an, anecdote, that, shaka, joked, with, one, of, his, friends, magaye, that, he, could, not, kill, magaye, because, he, would, be, laughed, at, supposedly, if, he, killed, magaye, it, would, appear, to, be, out, of, jealousy, because, magaye, was, so, handsome, and, shaka, himself, was, ugly, with, a, protruding, forehead, the, figure, of, shaka, still, sparks, interest, among, not, only, the, contemporary, zulu, but, many, worldwide, who, have, encountered, the, tribe, and, its, history, the, current, tendency, appears, to, be, to, lionise, him, popular, film, and, other, media, have, certainly, contributed, to, his, appeal, certain, aspects, of, traditional, zulu, culture, still, revere, the, dead, monarch, the, praise, song, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, poetic, forms, in, africa, applying, not, only, to, spirits, but, to, men, animals, plants, and, even, towns, he, is, shaka, the, unshakeable, thunderer, while, sitting, son, of, menzi, he, is, the, bird, that, preys, on, other, birds, the, battle, axe, that, excels, over, other, battle, axes, in, sharpness, he, is, the, long, strided, pursuer, son, of, ndaba, who, pursued, the, sun, and, the, moon, he, is, the, great, hubbub, like, the, rocks, of, nkandla, where, elephants, take, shelter, when, the, heavens, frown, traditional, zulu, praise, song, english, translation, by, ezekiel, mphahlele, other, zulu, sources, are, sometimes, critical, of, shaka, and, numerous, negative, images, abound, in, zulu, oral, history, when, shaka, s, mother, nandi, died, for, example, the, monarch, ordered, a, massive, outpouring, of, grief, including, mass, executions, forbidding, the, planting, of, crops, or, the, use, of, milk, and, the, killing, of, all, pregnant, women, and, their, husbands, oral, sources, record, that, in, this, period, of, devastation, a, single, zulu, a, man, named, gala, eventually, stood, up, to, shaka, and, objected, to, these, measures, pointing, out, that, nandi, was, not, the, first, person, to, die, in, zululand, taken, aback, by, such, candid, talk, the, zulu, king, is, supposed, to, have, called, off, the, destructive, edicts, rewarding, the, blunt, teller, of, truths, with, a, gift, of, cattle, the, figure, of, shaka, thus, remains, an, ambiguous, one, in, african, oral, tradition, defying, simplistic, depictions, of, the, zulu, king, as, a, heroic, protean, nation, builder, on, one, hand, or, a, depraved, monster, on, the, other, this, ambiguity, continues, to, lend, the, image, of, shaka, its, continued, power, and, influence, almost, two, centuries, after, his, death
