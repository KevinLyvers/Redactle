with, the, birth, of, his, son, who, was, dubbed, khoshghadam, bird, of, good, omen, like, most, iranians, at, the, time, reza, khan, did, not, have, a, surname, after, the, 1921, persian, coup, d,

24, april, 1926, mohammad, reza, was, proclaimed, crown, prince, mohammad, reza, described, his, father, in, his, book, mission, for, my, country, as, one, of, the, most, frightening, men, he, had, ever, known, depicting, reza, khan, as, a, dominating, man, with, a, violent, temper, a, tough, fierce, and, very, ambitious, soldier, who, became, the, first, persian, to, command, the, elite,

homosexuality, later, in, life, so, to, ensure, his, favourite, son, was, heterosexual, he, denied, him, love, and, affection, when, he, was, young, though, he, later, became, more, affectionate, toward, the, crown, prince, when, he, was, a, teenager, reza, khan, always, addressed, his, son, as, shoma, sir, and, refused, to, use, the, more, informal, tow, you, and, in, turn, was, addressed, by, his, son, using, the, same, formality, the, polish, journalist, ryszard, kapu, ci, ski, observed, in, his, book, shah, of, shahs, that, looking, at, old, photographs, of, reza, khan, and, his, son, he, was, struck, by, how, self, confident, and, assured, reza, khan, appeared, in, his, uniform, while, mohammad, reza, appeared, nervous, and, jittery, in, his, uniform, standing, next, to, his, father, in, the, 1930s, reza, khan, was, an, outspoken, admirer, of, adolf, hitler, less, because, of, hitler, s, racism, and, anti, semitism, and, more, because, he, had, risen, from, an, undistinguished, background, much, like, reza, khan, to, become, a, notable, leader, of, the, 20th, century, reza, khan, often, impressed, on, his, son, his, belief, that, history, was, made, by, great, men, such, as, himself, and, that, a, real, leader, is, an, autocrat, reza, khan, was, a, large, muscular, man, who, stood, at, over, 6, feet, 4, inches, 1, 93, m, leading, his, son, to, liken, him, to, a, mountain, throughout, his, life, mohammad, reza, was, obsessed, with, height, and, stature, wearing, elevator, shoes, to, make, himself, look, taller, than, he, really, was, often, boasting, that, iran, s, highest, mountain, mount, damavand, was, higher, than, any, peak, in, europe, or, japan, and, proclaiming, that, he, was, always, most, attracted, to, tall, women, as, shah, mohammad, reza, constantly, disparaged, his, father, in, private, calling, him, a, thuggish, cossack, who, achieved, nothing, as, shah, in, fact, he, almost, airbrushed, his, father, out, of, history, during, his, reign, to, the, point, of, implying, the, house, of, pahlavi, began, its, rule, in, 1941, rather, than, 1925, mohammad, reza, s, mother, tadj, ol, molouk, was, an, assertive, woman, who, was, also, very, superstitious, she, believed, that, dreams, were, messages, from, another, world, sacrificed, lambs, to, bring, good, fortune, and, scare, away, evil, spirits, and, clad, her, children, with, protective, amulets, to, ward, off, the, power, of, the, evil, eye, tadj, ol, molouk, was, the, main, emotional, support, to, her, son, and, she, cultivated, a, belief, in, him, that, destiny, had, chosen, him, for, great, things, which, the, soothsayers, she, consulted, had, interpreted, her, dreams, as, proving, mohammad, reza, grew, up, surrounded, by, women, as, the, main, influences, on, him, were, his, mother, his, older, sister, shams, and, his, twin, sister, ashraf, leading, the, american, psychoanalyst, and, political, economist, marvin, zonis, to, conclude, that, it, was, from, women, and, apparently, from, women, alone, that, the, future, shah, received, whatever, psychological, nourishment, he, was, able, to, get, as, a, child, traditionally, male, children, were, considered, preferable, to, females, and, as, a, boy, mohammad, reza, was, often, spoiled, by, his, mother, and, sisters, mohammad, reza, was, very, close, to, his, twin, sister, ashraf, who, commented, it, was, this, twinship, and, this, relationship, with, my, brother, that, would, nourish, and, sustain, me, throughout, my, childhood, no, matter, how, i, would, reach, out, in, the, years, to, come, sometimes, even, desperately, to, find, an, identity, and, a, purpose, of, my, own, i, would, remain, inextricably, tied, to, my, brother, always, the, center, of, my, existence, was, and, is, mohammad, reza, after, becoming, crown, prince, mohammad, reza, was, taken, away, from, his, mother, and, sisters, to, be, given, a, manly, education, by, officers, selected, by, his, father, who, also, ordered, that, everyone, including, his, mother, and, siblings, were, to, address, the, crown, prince, as, your, highness, according, to, zonis, the, result, of, his, contradictory, upbringing, by, a, loving, if, possessive, and, superstitious, mother, and, an, overbearing, martinet, father, was, to, make, mohammad, reza, a, young, man, of, low, self, esteem, who, masked, his, lack, of, self, confidence, his, indecisiveness, his, passivity, his, dependency, and, his, shyness, with, masculine, bravado, impulsiveness, and, arrogance, this, made, him, into, a, person, of, marked, contradictions, zonis, claims, as, the, crown, prince, was, both, gentle, and, cruel, withdrawn, and, active, dependent, and, assertive, weak, and, powerful, by, the, time, mohammad, reza, turned, 11, his, father, deferred, to, the, recommendation, of, abdolhossein, teymourtash, the, minister, of, court, to, dispatch, his, son, to, institut, le, rosey, a, swiss, boarding, school, for, further, studies, mohammad, reza, left, iran, for, switzerland, on, 7, september, 1931, on, his, first, day, as, a, student, at, le, rosey, the, crown, prince, antagonised, a, group, of, his, fellow, students, by, demanding, that, they, all, stand, to, attention, as, he, walked, past, just, as, everybody, did, back, in, iran, in, response, one, of, the, american, students, beat, him, up, and, he, swiftly, learned, to, accept, that, people, would, not, respect, him, in, switzerland, in, the, way, he, was, accustomed, to, at, home, as, a, student, mohammad, reza, played, competitive, football, but, school, records, indicate, that, his, principal, problem, as, a, player, was, his, timidity, as, the, crown, prince, was, afraid, to, take, risks, he, was, educated, in, french, at, le, rosey, and, his, time, there, left, mohammad, reza, with, a, lifelong, love, of, all, things, french, in, articles, he, wrote, in, french, for, the, student, newspaper, in, 1935, and, 1936, mohammad, reza,

hired, had, to, be, sacked, at, once, as, his, father, s, closest, advisor, the, crown, prince, mohammad, reza, did, not, see, fit, to, raise, the, issue, of, a, possible, anglo, soviet, invasion, of, iran, blithely, assuring, his, father, that, nothing, would, happen, the, iranian, american, historian, abbas, milani, wrote, about, the, relationship, between, the, reza, khan, and, the, crown, prince, at, the, time, noting, as, his, father, s, now, constant, companion, the, two, men, consulted, on, virtually, every, decision, later, that, year, british, and, soviet, forces, occupied, iran, in, a, military, invasion, forcing, reza, shah, to, abdicate, on, 25, august, 1941, british, and, australian, naval, forces, attacked, the, persian, gulf, while, the, soviet, union, conducted, a, land, invasion, from, the, north, on, the, second, day, of, the, invasion, with, the, soviet, air, force, bombing, tehran, mohammad, reza, was, shocked, to, see, the, iranian, military, simply, collapse, with, thousands, of, terrified, officers, and, men, all, over, tehran, taking, off, their, uniforms, in, order, to, desert, and, run, away, despite, having, not, yet, seen, combat, reflecting, the, panic, a, group, of, senior, iranian, generals, called, the, crown, prince, to, receive, his, blessing, to, hold, a, meeting, to, discuss, how, best, to, surrender, when, reza, khan, learned, of, the, meeting, he, flew, into, a, rage, and, attacked, one, of, his, generals, ahmad, nakhjavan, striking, him, with, his, riding, crop, tearing, off, his, medals, and, nearly, personally, executing, him, before, his, son, persuaded, him, to, have, the, general, court, martialed, instead, the, collapse, of, the, iranian, military, that, his, father, had, worked, so, hard, to, build, humiliated, his, son, who, vowed, that, he, would, never, see, iran, defeated, like, that, again, foreshadowing, the, future, shah, s, later, obsession, with, military, spending, on, 16, september, 1941, prime, minister, mohammad, ali, foroughi, and, foreign, minister, ali, soheili, attended, a, special, session, of, parliament, to, announce, the, resignation, of, reza, shah, and, that, mohammad, reza, was, to, replace, him, the, next, day, at, 4, 30, pm, mohammad, reza, took, the, oath, of, office, and, was, received, warmly, by, parliamentarians, on, his, way, back, to, the, palace, the, streets, filled, with, people, welcoming, the, new, shah, jubilantly, seemingly, more, enthusiastic, than, the, allies, would, have, liked, the, british, would, have, liked, to, put, a, qajar, back, on, the, throne, but, the, principal, qajar, claimant, to, the, throne, was, prince, hamid, mirza, an, officer, in, the, royal, navy, who, did, not, speak, persian, so, the, british, were, forced, to, accept, mohammad, reza, as, shah, the, main, soviet, interest, in, 1941, was, to, ensure, political, stability, to, ensure, allied, supplies, which, meant, accepting, mohammad, reza, s, ascension, to, the, throne, subsequent, to, his, succession, as, king, iran, became, a, major, conduit, for, british, and, later, american, aid, to, the, ussr, during, the, war, this, massive, supply, route, became, known, as, the, persian, corridor, much, of, the, credit, for, orchestrating, a, smooth, transition, of, power, from, the, king, to, the, crown, prince, was, due, to, the, efforts, of, mohammad, ali, foroughi, suffering, from, angina, a, frail, foroughi, was, summoned, to, the, palace, and, appointed, prime, minister, when, reza, shah, feared, the, end, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, once, the, allies, invaded, iran, in, 1941, when, reza, shah, sought, his, assistance, to, ensure, that, the, allies, would, not, put, an, end, to, the, pahlavi, dynasty, foroughi, put, aside, his, adverse, personal, sentiments, for, having, been, politically, sidelined, since, 1935, the, crown, prince, confided, in, amazement, to, the, british, minister, that, foroughi, hardly, expected, any, son, of, reza, shah, to, be, a, civilized, human, being, but, foroughi, successfully, derailed, thoughts, by, the, allies, to, undertake, a, more, drastic, change, in, the, political, infrastructure, of, iran, a, general, amnesty, was, issued, two, days, after, mohammad, reza, s, accession, to, the, throne, on, 19, september, 1941, all, political, personalities, who, had, suffered, disgrace, during, his, father, s, reign, were, rehabilitated, and, the, forced, unveiling, policy, inaugurated, by, his, father, in, 1935, was, overturned, despite, the, young, king, s, enlightened, decisions, the, british, minister, in, tehran, reported, to, london, that, the, young, shah, received, a, fairly, spontaneous, welcome, on, his, first, public, experience, possibly, rather, to, relief, at, the, disappearance, of, his, father, than, to, public, affection, for, himself, during, his, early, days, as, shah, mohammad, reza, lacked, self, confidence, and, spent, most, of, his, time, with, perron, writing, poetry, in, french, in, 1942, mohammad, reza, met, wendell, willkie, the, republican, candidate, for, the, u, s, presidency, in, the, 1940, election, who, was, now, on, a, world, tour, to, promote, his, one, world, policy, willkie, took, the, shah, flying, for, the, first, time, the, prime, minister, ahmad, qavam, had, advised, the, shah, against, flying, with, willkie, saying, he, had, never, met, a, man, with, a, worse, flatulence, problem, but, the, shah, took, his, chances, mohammad, reza, told, willkie, that, when, he, was, flying, that, he, wanted, to, stay, up, indefinitely, enjoying, flight, mohammad, reza, hired, the, american, pilot, dick, collbarn, to, teach, him, how, to, fly, upon, arriving, at, the, marble, palace, collbarn, noted, that, the, shah, must, have, twenty, five, custom, built, cars, buicks, cadillacs, six, rolls, royces, a, mercedes, during, the, tehran, conference, with, the, allied, forces, in, 1943, the, shah, was, humiliated, when, he, met, joseph, stalin, who, visited, him, in, the, marble, palace, and, did, not, allow, the, shah, s, bodyguards, to, be, present, with, the, red, army, alone, guarding, them, despite, his, public, professions, of, admiration, in, later, years, mohammad, reza, had, serious, misgivings, about, not, only, the, coarse, and, roughshod, political, means, adopted, by, his, father, but, also, his, unsophisticated, approach, to, affairs, of, state, the, young, shah, possessed, a, decidedly, more, refined, temperament, and, amongst, the, unsavory, developments, that, would, haunt, him, when, he, was, king, were, the, political, disgrace, brought, by, his, father, on, teymourtash, the, dismissal, of, foroughi, by, the, mid, 1930s, and, ali, akbar, davar, s, suicide, in, 1937, an, even, more, significant, decision, that, cast, a, long, shadow, was, the, disastrous, and, one, sided, agreement, his, father, had, negotiated, with, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, apoc, in, 1933, one, which, compromised, the, country, s, ability, to, receive, more, favourable, returns, from, oil, extracted, from, the, country, mohammad, reza, expressed, concern, for, his, exiled, father, who, had, previously, complained, to, the, british, governor, of, mauritius, that, living, on, the, island, was, both, a, climatic, and, social, prison, attentively, following, his, life, in, exile, mohammad, reza, would, object, to, his, father, s, treatment, to, the, british, at, any, opportunity, the, two, sent, letters, to, one, another, although, delivery, was, often, delayed, and, mohammad, reza, commissioned, his, friend, ernest, perron, to, hand, deliver, a, taped, message, of, love, and, respect, to, his, father, bringing, back, with, him, a, recording, of, his, voice, my, dear, son, since, the, time, i, resigned, in, your, favour, and, left, my, country, my, only, pleasure, has, been, to, witness, your, sincere, service, to, your, country, i, have, always, known, that, your, youth, and, your, love, of, the, country, are, vast, reservoirs, of, power, on, which, you, will, draw, to, stand, firm, against, the, difficulties, you, face, and, that, despite, all, the, troubles, you, will, emerge, from, this, ordeal, with, honour, not, a, moment, passes, without, my, thinking, of, you, and, yet, the, only, thing, that, keeps, me, happy, and, satisfied, is, the, thought, that, you, are, spending, your, time, in, the, service, of, iran, you, must, remain, always, aware, of, what, goes, on, in, the, country, you, must, not, succumb, to, advice, that, is, self, serving, and, false, you, must, remain, firm, and, constant, you, must, never, be, afraid, of, the, events, that, come, your, way, now, that, you, have, taken, on, your, shoulders, this, heavy, burden, in, such, dark, days, you, must, know, that, the, price, to, be, paid, for, the, slightest, mistake, on, your, part, may, be, our, twenty, years, of, service, and, our, family, s, name, you, must, never, yield, to, anxiety, or, despair, rather, you, must, remain, calm, and, so, strongly, rooted, in, your, place, that, no, power, may, hope, to, move, the, constancy, of, your, will, in, 1945, 46, the, main, issue, in, iranian, politics, was, the, soviet, sponsored, separatist, government, in, iranian, azerbaijan, and, kurdistan, which, greatly, alarmed, the, shah, he, repeatedly, clashed, with, his, prime, minister, ahmad, qavam, whom, he, viewed, as, too, pro, soviet, at, the, same, time, the, growing, popularity, of, the, communist, tudeh, party, worried, mohammad, reza, who, felt, there, was, a, serious, possibility, of, them, leading, a, coup, in, june, 1946, mohammad, reza, was, relieved, when, the, red, army, pulled, out, of, iran, in, a, letter, to, the, azerbaijani, communist, leader, ja, far, pishevari, stalin, wrote, that, he, had, to, pull, out, of, iran, as, otherwise, the, americans, would, not, pull, out, of, china, and, he, wanted, to, assist, the, chinese, communists, in, their, civil, war, against, the, kuomintang, however, the, pishevari, regime, remained, in, power, in, tabriz, azerbaijan, and, mohammad, reza, sought, to, undercut, qavam, s, attempts, to, make, an, agreement, with, pishevari, as, way, of, getting, rid, of, both, on, 11, december, 1946, the, iranian, army, led, by, the, shah, in, person, entered, iranian, azerbaijan, and, the, pishevari, regime, collapsed, with, little, resistance, with, most, of, the, fighting, occurring, between, ordinary, people, who, attacked, functionaries, of, the, pishevari, that, had, treated, them, brutally, in, his, statements, at, the, time, and, later, mohammad, reza, credited, his, easy, success, in, azerbaijan, to, his, mystical, power, knowing, qavam, s, penchant, for, corruption, the, shah, used, that, issue, as, a, reason, to, sack, him, by, this, time, the, shah, s, wife, fawzia, had, returned, to, egypt, and, despite, efforts, to, have, king, farouk, persuade, her, to, return, to, iran, she, refused, to, go, which, led, mohammad, reza, to, divorce, her, on, 17, november, 1948, by, now, a, qualified, pilot, mohammad, reza, was, fascinated, with, flying, and, the, technical, details, of, aeroplanes, and, any, insult, to, him, was, always, an, attempt, to, clip, wings, mohammad, reza, directed, more, money, to, the, imperial, iranian, air, force, than, any, branch, of, the, armed, forces, and, his, favourite, uniform, was, that, of, the, marshal, of, the, imperial, iranian, air, force, marvin, zonis, wrote, that, mohammad, reza, s, obsession, with, flying, reflected, an, icarus, complex, also, known, as, ascensionism, a, form, of, narcissism, based, on, a, craving, for, unsolicited, attention, and, admiration, and, the, wish, to, overcome, gravity, to, stand, erect, to, grow, tall, to, leap, or, swing, into, the, air, to, climb, to, rise, to, fly, mohammad, reza, often, spoke, of, women, as, sexual, objects, who, existed, only, to, gratify, him, and, during, a, 1973, interview, with, italian, journalist, oriana, fallaci, she, vehemently, objected, to, his, attitudes, towards, women, as, a, regular, visitor, to, the, nightclubs, of, italy, france, and, the, united, kingdom, mohammad, reza, was, linked, romantically, to, several, actresses, including, gene, tierney, yvonne, de, carlo, and, silvana, mangano, at, least, two, unsuccessful, assassination, attempts, were, made, against, the, young, shah, on, 4, february, 1949, he, attended, an, annual, ceremony, to, commemorate, the, founding, of, tehran, university, at, the, ceremony, gunman, fakhr, arai, fired, five, shots, at, him, at, a, range, of, about, three, metres, only, one, of, the, shots, hit, the, king, grazing, his, cheek, the, gunman, was, instantly, shot, by, nearby, officers, after, an, investigation, fakhr, arai, was, declared, a, member, of, the, communist, tudeh, party, which, was, subsequently, banned, however, there, is, evidence, that, the, would, be, assassin, was, not, a, tudeh, member, but, a, religious, fundamentalist, member, of, fada, iyan, e, islam, the, tudeh, were, nonetheless, blamed, and, persecuted, the, shah, s, second, wife, was, soraya, esfandiary, bakhtiary, a, half, german, half, iranian, woman, and, the, only, daughter, of, khalil, esfandiary, bakhtiary, iranian, ambassador, to, west, germany, and, his, wife, eva, karl, she, was, introduced, to, the, shah, by, forough, zafar, bakhtiary, a, close, relative, of, soraya, s, via, a, photograph, taken, by, goodarz, bakhtiary, in, london, per, forough, zafar, s, request, they, married, on, 12, february, 1951, when, soraya, was, 18, according, to, the, official, announcement, however, it, was, rumoured, that, she, was, actually, 16, the, shah, being, 32, as, a, child, she, was, tutored, and, brought, up, by, frau, mantel, and, hence, lacked, proper, knowledge, of, iran, as, she, herself, admitted, in, her, personal, memoirs, stating, i, was, a, dunce, i, knew, next, to, nothing, of, the, geography, the, legends, of, my, country, nothing, of, its, history, nothing, of, muslim, religion, by, the, early, 1950s, the, political, crisis, brewing, in, iran, commanded, the, attention, of, british, and, american, policy, leaders, following, the, 1950, iranian, legislative, election, mohammad, mosaddegh, was, elected, prime, minister, in, 1951, he, was, committed, to, nationalising, the, iranian, petroleum, industry, controlled, by, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, aioc, formerly, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, or, apoc, under, the, leadership, of, mosaddegh, and, his, nationalist, movement, the, iranian, parliament, unanimously, voted, to, nationalise, the, oil, industry, thus, shutting, out, the, immensely, profitable, aioc, which, was, a, pillar, of, britain, s, economy, and, provided, it, political, clout, in, the, region, at, the, start, of, the, confrontation, american, political, sympathy, with, iran, was, forthcoming, from, the, truman, administration, in, particular, mosaddegh, was, buoyed, by, the, advice, and, counsel, he, was, receiving, from, the, american, ambassador, in, tehran, henry, f, grady, however, eventually, american, decision, makers, lost, their, patience, and, by, the, time, the, republican, administration, of, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, entered, office, fears, that, communists, were, poised, to, overthrow, the, government, became, an, all, consuming, concern, these, concerns, were, later, dismissed, as, paranoid, in, retrospective, commentary, on, the, coup, from, u, s, government, officials, shortly, prior, to, the, 1952, presidential, election, in, the, united, states, the, british, government, invited, central, intelligence, agency, cia,

seat, and, covered, himself, with, a, blanket, as, guards, waved, his, driver, through, the, gates, the, shah, got, into, the, car, and, roosevelt, explained, the, mission, the, cia, bribed, him, with, 1, million, in, iranian, currency, which, roosevelt, had, stored, in, a, large, safe, a, bulky, cache, given, the, then, exchange, rate, of, 1, 000, rial, to, 15, us, dollars, meanwhile, the,

masudi, criticised, him, calling, the, defeat, humiliating, during, the, shah, s, time, in, rome, a, british, diplomat, reported, that, the, monarch, spent, most, of, his, time, in, nightclubs, with, queen, soraya, or, his, latest, mistress, writing, he, hates, taking, decisions, and, cannot, be, relied, on, to, stick, to, them, when, taken, he, has, no, moral, courage, and, succumbs, easily, to, fear, to, get, him, to, support, the, coup, his, twin, sister, princess, ashraf, who, was, much, tougher, than, him, and, publicly, questioned, his, manhood, several, times, visited, him, on, 29,

front, leaders, like, hossein, makki, who, sided, with, the, king, on, 18, august, 1953, mosaddegh, defended, the, government, against, this, new, attack, tudeh, partisans, were, clubbed, and, dispersed, the, tudeh, party, had, no, choice, but, to, accept, defeat, in, the, meantime, according, to, the, cia, plot, zahedi, appealed, to, the, military, claimed, to, be, the, legitimate, prime, minister, and, charged, mosaddegh, with, staging, a, coup, by, ignoring, the, shah, s, decree, zahedi, s, son, ardeshir, acted, as, the, contact, between, the, cia, and, his, father, on, 19, august, 1953, pro, shah, partisans, bribed, with, 100, 000, in, cia, funds, finally, appeared, and, marched, out, of, south, tehran, into, the, city, centre, where, others, joined, in, gangs, with, clubs, knives, and, rocks, controlled, the, streets, overturning, tudeh, trucks, and, beating, up, anti, shah, activists, as, roosevelt, was, congratulating, zahedi, in, the, basement, of, his, hiding, place, the, new, prime, minister, s, mobs, burst, in, and, carried, him, upstairs, on, their, shoulders, that, evening, henderson, suggested, to, ardashir, that, mosaddegh, not, be, harmed, roosevelt, gave, zahedi, us, 900, 000, left, from, operation, ajax, funds, after, his, brief, exile, in, italy, the, shah, returned, to, iran, this, time, through, the, successful, second, coup, attempt, the, deposed, mosaddegh, was, arrested, and, tried, with, the, king, intervening, and, commuting, his, sentence, to, three, years, to, be, followed, by, life, in, internal, exile, zahedi, was, installed, to, succeed, mosaddegh, although, mohammad, reza, returned, to, power, he, never, extended, the, elite, status, of, the, court, to, the, technocrats, and, intellectuals, who, emerged, from, iranian, and, western, universities, indeed, his, system, irritated, the, new, classes, for, they, were, barred, from, partaking, in, real, power, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1953, coup, d, tat, mohammad, reza, was, widely, viewed, as, a, figurehead, monarch, and, general, fazlollah, zahedi, the, prime, minister, saw, himself, and, was, viewed, by, others, as, the, strong, man, of, iran, mohammad, reza, feared, that, history, would, repeat, itself, remembering, how, his, father, was, a, general, who, had, seized, power, in, a, coup, d, tat, in, 1921, and, deposed, the, last, qajar, shah, in, 1925, and, his, major, concern, in, the, years, 1953, 55, was, to, neutralise, zahedi, american, and, british, diplomats, in, their, reports, back, to, washington, and, london, in, the, 1950s, were, openly, contemptuous, of, mohammad, reza, s, ability, to, lead, calling, the, shah, a, weak, willed, and, cowardly, man, who, was, incapable, of, making, a, decision, the, contempt, in, which, the, shah, was, held, by, iranian, elites, led, to, a, period, in, the, mid, 1950s, where, the, elite, displayed, fissiparous, tendencies, feuding, amongst, themselves, now, that, mossadegh, had, been, overthrown, which, ultimately, allowed, mohammad, reza, to, play, off, various, factions, in, the, elite, to, assert, himself, as, the, nation, s, leader, the, very, fact, that, mohammad, reza, was, considered, a, coward, and, insubstantial, turned, out, be, an, advantage, as, the, shah, proved, to, be, an, adroit, politician, playing, off, the, factions, in, the, elite, and, the, americans, against, the, british, with, the, aim, of, being, an, autocrat, in, practice, as, well, as, in, theory, supporters, of, the, banned, national, front, were, persecuted, but, in, his, first, important, decision, as, leader, mohammad, reza, intervened, to, ensure, most, of, the, members, of, the, national, front, brought, to, trial, such, as, mosaddegh, himself, were, not, executed, as, many, had, expected, many, in, the, iranian, elite, were, openly, disappointed, that, mohammad, reza, did, not, conduct, the, expected, bloody, purge, and, hang, mosaddegh, and, his, followers, as, they, had, wanted, and, expected, in, 1954, when, twelve, university, professors, issued, a, public, statement, criticising, the, 1953, coup, all, were, dismissed, from, their, jobs, but, in, the, first, of, his, many, acts, of, magnanimity, towards, the, national, front, mohammad, reza, intervened, to, have, them, reinstated, mohammad, reza, tried, very, hard, to, co, opt, the, supporters, of, the, national, front, by, adopting, some, of, their, rhetoric, and, addressing, their, concerns, for, example, declaring, in, several, speeches, his, concerns, about, the, third, world, economic, conditions, and, poverty, which, prevailed, in, iran, a, matter, that, had, not, much, interested, him, before, mohammad, reza, was, determined, to, copy, mosaddegh, who, had, won, popularity, by, promising, broad, socio, economic, reforms, and, wanted, to, create, a, mass, powerbase, as, he, did, not, wish, to, depend, upon, the, traditional, elites, who, only, wanted, him, as, a, legitimising, figurehead, in, 1955, mohammad, reza, dismissed, general, zahedi, from, his, position, as, prime, minister, and, appointed, his, archenemy, the, technocrat, hossein, ala, as, prime, minister, whom, he, in, turn, dismissed, in, 1957, starting, in, 1955, mohammad, reza, began, to, quietly, cultivate, left, wing, intellectuals, many, of, whom, had, supported, the, national, front, and, some, of, whom, were, associated, with, the, banned, tudeh, party, asking, them, for, advice, about, how, best, to, reform, iran, it, was, during, this, period, that, mohammad, reza, began, to, embrace, the, image, of, a, progressive, shah, a, reformer, who, would, modernise, iran, who, attacked, in, his, speeches, the, reactionary, and, feudal, social, system, that, was, retarding, progress, bring, about, land, reform, and, give, women, equal, rights, determined, to, rule, as, well, as, reign, it, was, during, the, mid, 1950s, that, mohammad, reza, started, to, promote, a, state, cult, around, cyrus, the, great, portrayed, as, a, great, shah, who, had, reformed, the, country, and, built, an, empire, with, obvious, parallels, to, himself, alongside, this, change, in, image, mohammad, reza, started, to, speak, of, his, desire, to, save, iran, a, duty, that, he, claimed, he, had, been, given, by, god, and, promised, that, under, his, leadership, iran, would, reach, a, western, standard, of, living, in, the, near, future, during, this, period, mohammad, reza, sought, the, support, of, the, ulema, and, resumed, the, traditional, policy, of, persecuting, those, iranians, who, belonged, to, the, bah, faith, allowing, the, chief, bah, temple, in, tehran, to, be, razed, in, 1955, and, bringing, in, a, law, banning, the, bah, from, gathering, together, in, groups, a, british, diplomat, reported, in, 1954, that, reza, khan, must, have, been, spinning, in, his, grave, at, rey, to, see, the, arrogance, and, effrontery, of, the, mullahs, once, again, rampant, in, the, holy, city, how, the, old, tyrant, must, despise, the, weakness, of, his, son, who, allowed, these, turbulent, priests, to, regain, so, much, of, their, reactionary, influence, by, this, time, the, shah, s, marriage, was, under, strain, as, queen, soraya, complained, about, the, power, of, mohammad, reza, s, best, friend, ernest, perron, whom, she, called, a, shetun, and, a, limping, devil, perron, was, a, man, much, resented, for, his, influence, on, mohammad, reza, and, was, often, described, by, enemies, as, a, diabolical, and, mysterious, character, whose, position, was, that, of, a, private, secretary, but, who, was, one, of, the, shah, s, closest, advisors, holding, far, more, power, than, his, job, title, suggested, in, a, 1957, study, compiled, by, the, u, s, state, department, mohammad, reza, was, praised, for, his, growing, maturity, and, no, longer, needing, to, seek, advice, at, every, turn, as, the, previous, 1951, study, had, concluded, on, 27, february, 1958, a, military, coup, to, depose, the, shah, led, by, general, valiollah, gharani, was, thwarted, which, led, to, a, major, crisis, in, iranian, american, relations, when, evidence, emerged, that, associates, of, gharani, had, met, american, diplomats, in, athens, which, the, shah, used, to, demand, that, henceforward, no, american, officials, could, meet, with, his, opponents, another, issue, in, iranian, american, relations, was, mohammad, reza, s, suspicion, that, the, united, states, was, insufficiently, committed, to, iran, s, defense, observing, that, the, americans, refused, to, join, the, baghdad, pact, and, military, studies, had, indicated, that, iran, could, only, hold, out, for, a, few, days, in, the, event, of, a, soviet, invasion, in, january, 1959, the, shah, began, negotiations, on, a, non, aggression, pact, with, the, soviet, union, which, he, claimed, to, have, been, driven, to, by, a, lack, of, american, support, after, receiving, a, mildly, threatening, letter, from, president, eisenhower, warning, him, against, signing, the, treaty, mohammad, reza, chose, not, to, sign, which, led, to, a, major, soviet, propaganda, effort, calling, for, his, overthrow, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, ordered, mohammad, reza, assassinated, a, sign, of, mohammad, reza, s, power, came, in, 1959, when, a, british, company, won, a, contract, with, the, iranian, government, that, was, suddenly, cancelled, and, given, to, siemens, instead, an, investigation, by, the, british, embassy, soon, uncovered, the, reason, why, mohammad, reza, wanted, to, bed, the, wife, of, the, siemens, sales, agent, for, iran, and, the, siemens, agent, had, consented, to, allowing, his, wife, to, sleep, with, the, shah, in, exchange, for, winning, back, the, contract, that, he, had, just, lost, on, 24, july, 1959, mohammad, reza, gave, israel, de, facto, recognition, by, allowing, an, israeli, trade, office, to, be, opened, in, tehran, that, functioned, as, a, de, facto, embassy, a, move, that, offended, many, in, the, islamic, world, when, eisenhower, visited, iran, on, 14, december, 1959, mohammad, reza, told, him, that, iran, faced, two, main, external, threats, the, soviet, union, to, the, north, and, the, new, pro, soviet, revolutionary, government, in, iraq, to, the, west, this, led, him, to, ask, for, vastly, increased, american, military, aid, saying, his, country, was, a, front, line, state, in, the, cold, war, that, needed, as, much, military, power, as, possible, the, shah, and, soraya, s, marriage, ended, in, 1958, when, it, became, apparent, that, even, with, help, from, medical, doctors, she, could, not, bear, children, soraya, later, told, the, new, york, times, that, the, shah, had, no, choice, but, to, divorce, her, and, that, he, was, heavy, hearted, about, the, decision, however, even, after, the, marriage, it, is, reported, that, the, shah, still, had, great, love, for, soraya, and, it, is, reported, that, they, met, several, times, after, their, divorce, and, that, she, lived, her, post, divorce, life, comfortably, as, a, wealthy, lady, even, though, she, never, remarried, being, paid, a,

princess, the, vatican, newspaper, l, osservatore, romano, considered, the, match, a, grave, danger, especially, considering, that, under, the, 1917, code, of, canon, law, a, roman, catholic, who, married, a, divorced, person, would, be, automatically, and, could, be, formally, excommunicated, in, the, 1960, u, s, presidential, election, the, shah, had, favoured, the, republican, candidate, incumbent, vice, president, richard, nixon, whom, he, had, first, met, in, 1953, and, rather, liked, and, according, to, the, diary, of, his, best, friend, asadollah, alam, mohammad, reza, contributed, money, to, the, 1960, nixon, campaign, relations, with, the, victor, of, the, 1960, election, the, democrat, john, f, kennedy, were, not, friendly, in, an, attempt, to, mend, relations,

bakhtiar, during, his, trip, to, washington, had, asked, the, americans, to, support, a, coup, he, was, planning, which, greatly, increased, the, shah, s, fears, about, kennedy, on, 2, may, 1961, a, teacher, s, strike, involving, 50, 000, people, began, in, iran, which, mohammad, reza, believed, was, the, work, of, the, cia, mohammad, reza, had, to, sack, his, prime, minister, jafar, sharif,

washington, he, was, met, with, demonstrations, by, iranian, students, at, american, universities, which, he, believed, were, organised, by, u, s, attorney, general, robert, f, kennedy, the, president, s, brother, and, the, leading, anti, pahlavi, voice, in, the, kennedy, administration, afterwards, mohammad, reza, visited, london, in, a, sign, of, the, changed, dynamics, in, anglo, iranian, relations, the, shah, took, offence, when, he, was, informed, he, could, join, queen, elizabeth, ii, for, a, dinner, at, buckingham, palace, that, was, given, in, somebody, else, s, honour, insisting, successfully, he, would, have, dinner, with, the, queen, only, when, given, in, his, own, honour, mohammad, reza, s, first, major, clash, with, ayatollah, khomeini, occurred, in, 1962, when, the, shah, changed, the, local, laws, to, allow, iranian, jews, christians, zoroastrians, and, baha, i, to, take, the, oath, of, office, for, municipal, councils, using, their, holy, books, instead, of, the, koran, khomeini, wrote, to, the, shah, to, say, this, was, unacceptable, and, that, only, the, koran, could, be, used, to, swear, in, members, of, the, municipal, councils, regardless, of, what, their, religion, was, writing, that, he, heard, islam, is, not, indicated, as, a, precondition, for, standing, for, office, and, women, are, being, granted, the, right, to, vote, please, order, all, laws, inimical, to, the, sacred, and, official, faith, of, the, country, to, be, eliminated, from, government, policies, the, shah, wrote, back, addressing, khomeini, as, hojat, al, islam, rather, than, as, ayatollah, declining, his, request, feeling, pressure, from, demonstrations, organised, by, the, clergy, the, shah, withdrew, the, offending, law, but, it, was, reinstated, with, the, white, revolution, of, 1963, in, 1963, mohammad, reza, launched, the, white, revolution, a, series, of, far, reaching, reforms, which, caused, much, opposition, from, the, religious, scholars, they, were, enraged, that, the, referendum, approving, of, the, white, revolution, in, 1963, allowed, women, to, vote, with, the, ayatollah, khomeini, saying, in, his, sermons, that, the, fate, of, iran, should, never, be, allowed, to, be, decided, by, women, in, 1963, and, 1964, nationwide, demonstrations, against, mohammad, reza, s, rule, took, place, all, over, iran,

s, death, they, had, four, children, together, one, of, mohammad, reza, s, favourite, activities, was, watching, films, and, his, favourites, were, light, french, comedies, and, hollywood, action, films, much, to, the, disappointment, of, farah, who, tried, hard, to, interest, him, in, more, serious, films, mohammad, reza, was, frequently, unfaithful, towards, farah, and, his, right, hand, man, asadollah, alam, regularly, imported, tall, european, women, for, outings, with, the, shah, though, alam, s, diary, also, mentions, that, if, women, from, the, blue, eyed, world, were, not, available, he, would, bring, the, shah, local, product, mohammad, reza, had, an, insatiable, appetite, for, sex, and, alam, s, diary, has, the, shah, constantly, telling, him, he, needed, to, have, sex, several, times, a, day, every, day, or, otherwise, he, would, fall, into, depression, when, farah, found, out, about, his, affairs, in, 1973, alam, blamed, the, prime, minister, amir, abbas, hoveyda, while, the, shah, thought, it, was, the, kgb, milani, noted, that, neither, admitted, it, was, the, shah, s, crass, infidelities, that, caused, this, issue, milani, further, wrote, that, alam, in, his, most, destructive, moments, of, sycophancy, reassured, the, shah, or, his, master, as, he, calls, him, that, the, country, was, prosperous, and, no, one, begrudged, the, king, a, bit, of, fun, he, also, had, a, passion, for, automobiles, and, aeroplanes, and, by, the, middle, 1970s, the, shah, had, amassed, one, of, the, world, s, largest, collection, of, luxury, cars, and, planes, his, visits, to, the, west, were, invariably, the, occasions, for, major, protests, by, the, confederation, of, iranian, students, an, umbrella, group, of, far, left, iranian, university, students, studying, abroad, and, mohammad, reza, had, one, of, the, world, s, largest, security, details, as, he, lived, in, constant, fear, of, assassination, milani, described, mohammad, reza, s, court, as, open, and, tolerant, noting, that, his, and, farah, s, two, favourite, interior, designers, keyvan, khosrovani, and, bijan, saffari, were, openly, gay, and, were, not, penalised, for, their, sexual, orientation, with, khosrovani, often, giving, advice, to, the, shah, about, how, to, dress, milani, noted, the, close, connection, between, architecture, and, power, in, iran, as, architecture, is, the, poetry, of, power, in, iran, in, this, sense, the, niavaran, palace, with, its, mixture, of, modernist, style, heavily, influenced, by, current, french, styles, and, traditional, persian, style, reflected, mohammad, reza, s, personality, mohammad, reza, was, a, francophile, whose, court, had, a, decidedly, french, ambiance, to, it, mohammad, reza, commissioned, a, documentary, from, the, french, filmmaker, albert, lamorisse, meant, to, glorify, iran, under, his, rule, but, he, was, annoyed, that, the, film, focused, only, on, iran, s, past, writing, to, lamorisse, there, were, no, modern, buildings, in, his, film, which, he, charged, made, iran, look, backward, mohammad, reza, s, office, was, functional, whose, ceilings, and, walls, were, decorated, with, qajar, art, farah, began, collecting, modern, art, and, by, the, early, 1970s, owned, works, by, picasso, gauguin, chagall, and, braque, which, added, to, the, modernist, feel, of, the, niavaran, palace, on, 26, october, 1967, twenty, six, years, into, his, reign, as, shah, king, he, took, the, ancient, title, sh, hansh, h, emperor, or, king, of, kings, in, a, lavish, coronation, ceremony, held, in, tehran, he, said, that, he, chose, to, wait, until, this, moment, to, assume, the, title, because, in, his, own, opinion, he, did, not, deserve, it, up, until, then, he, is, also, recorded, as, saying, that, there, was, no, honour, in, being, emperor, of, a, poor, country, which, he, viewed, iran, as, being, until, that, time, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, modernise, iran, and, give, the, iranian, people, a, non, islamic, identity, mohammad, reza, quite, consciously, started, to, celebrate, iranian, history, before, the, arab, conquest, with, a, special, focus, on, the, achaemenid, period, in, october, 1971, he, marked, the, anniversary, of, 2, 500, years, of, continuous, persian, monarchy, since, the, founding, of, the, achaemenid, empire, by, cyrus, the, great, concurrent, with, this, celebration, mohammad, reza, changed, the, benchmark, of, the, iranian, calendar, from, the, hijrah, to, the, beginning, of, the, first, persian, empire, measured, from, cyrus, the, great, s, coronation, at, the, celebration, at, persepolis, in, 1971, the, shah, had, an, elaborate, fireworks, show, intended, to, send, a, dual, message, that, iran, was, still, faithful, to, its, ancient, traditions, and, that, iran, had, transcended, its, past, to, become, a, modern, nation, that, iran, was, not, stuck, in, the, past, but, as, a, nation, that, embraced, modernity, had, chosen, to, be, faithful, to, its, past, the, message, was, further, reinforced, the, next, day, when, the, parade, of, persian, history, was, performed, at, persepolis, when, 6, 000, soldiers, dressed, in, the, uniforms, of, every, dynasty, from, the, achaemenids, to, the, pahlavis, marched, past, mohammad, reza, in, a, grand, parade, that, many, contemporaries, remarked, surpassed, in, sheer, spectacle, the, most, florid, celluloid, imaginations, of, hollywood, epics, to, complete, the, message, mohammad, reza, finished, off, the, celebrations, by, opening, a, brand, new, museum, in, tehran, the, shahyad, aryamehr, that, was, housed, in, a, very, modernistic, building, and, attended, another, parade, in, the, newly, opened, aryamehr, stadium, intended, to, give, a, message, of, compressed, time, between, antiquity, and, modernity, a, brochure, put, up, by, the, celebration, committee, explicitly, stated, the, message, only, when, change, is, extremely, rapid, and, the, past, ten, years, have, proved, to, be, so, does, the, past, attain, new, and, unsuspected, values, worth, cultivating, going, on, to, say, the, celebrations, were, held, because, iran, has, begun, to, feel, confident, of, its, modernization, milani, noted, it, was, a, sign, of, the, liberalization, of, the, middle, years, of, mohammad, reza, s, reign, that, hussein, amanat, the, architect, who, designed, the, shahyad, was, a, young, baha, i, from, a, middle, class, family, who, did, not, belong, to, the, thousand, families, that, traditionally, dominated, iran, writing, that, only, in, this, moment, in, iranian, history, such, a, thing, was, possible, prior, to, the, 1973, oil, embargo, iran, spearheaded, opec, s, aim, for, higher, oil, prices, when, raising, oil, prices, iran, would, point, out, the, rising, inflation, as, a, means, to, justify, the, price, increases, in, the, aftermath, of, the, yom, kippur, war, arab, states, employed, an, oil, embargo, in, 1973, against, western, nations, although, the, shah, declared, neutrality, he, sought, to, exploit, the, lack, of, crude, oil, supply, to, iran, s, benefit, the, shah, held, a, meeting, of, persian, gulf, oil, producers, declaring, they, should, double, the, price, of, oil, for, the, second, time, in, a, year, the, price, hike, resulted, in, an, oil, shock, that, crippled, western, economies, while, iran, saw, a, rapid, growth, of, oil, revenues, iranian, oil, incomes, doubled, to, 4, 6, billion, in, 1973, 1974, and, spiked, to, 17, 8, billion, in, the, following, year, as, a, result, the, shah, had, established, himself, as, the, dominant, figure, of, opec, having, control, over, oil, prices, and, production, iran, experienced, an, economic, growth, rate, of, 33, in, 1973, and, 40, the, next, year, and, gnp, expanded, 50, in, the, next, year, the, shah, directed, the, growth, in, oil, revenues, back, into, the, domestic, economy, elementary, school, education, was, made, free, and, mandatory, major, investments, were, made, in, the, military, and, in, 1974, 16, billion, dollars, were, spent, on, building, new, schools, and, hospitals, the, shah, s, oil, coup, signaled, that, the, united, states, had, lost, the, ability, to, influence, iranian, foreign, and, economic, policy, under, the, shah, iran, dominated, opec, and, middle, eastern, oil, exports, by, the, 19th, century, the, persian, word, vatan, began, to, refer, to, a, national, homeland, by, many, intellectuals, in, iran, the, education, system, was, largely, controlled, by, shiite, clergy, who, utilized, a, maktab, system, in, which, open, political, discussion, of, modernization, was, prevented, however, a, number, of, scholarly, intellectuals, including, mirz, fath, ali, khundz, deh, mirz, q, kh, n, kerm, ni, and, mirz, malkam, kh, n, began, to, criticize, islam, s, role, in, public, life, while, promoting, a, secular, identity, for, iran, over, time, studies, of, iran, s, glorious, history, and, present, reality, of, a, declined, qajar, period, led, many, to, question, what, led, to, iran, s, decline, ultimately, iranian, history, was, categorized, into, two, periods, pre, islamic, and, islamic, iran, s, pre, islamic, period, was, seen, as, prosperous, while, the, arab, invasions, were, seen, as, a, political, catastrophe, that, pummelled, the, superior, iranian, civilization, under, its, hoof, therefore, as, a, result, of, the, growing, number, of, iranian, intellectuals, in, the, 1800s, the, ancient, persian, empire, symbolized, modernity, and, originality, while, the, islamic, period, brought, by, arab, invasions, brought, iran, to, a, period, of, backwardness, ultimately, these, revelations, in, iran, would, lead, to, the, rise, of, aryan, nationalism, in, iran, and, the, perception, of, an, intellectual, awakening, as, described, by, homa, katouzian, in, europe, many, concepts, of, aryan, nationalism, were, directed, at, the, anti, jewish, sentiment, in, contrast, iran, s, aryan, nationalism, was, deeply, rooted, in, persian, history, and, became, synonymous, with, an, anti, arab, sentiment, instead, furthermore, the, achaemenid, and, sasanian, periods, were, perceived, as, the, real, persia, a, persia, which, commanded, the, respect, of, the, world, and, was, void, of, foreign, culture, before, the, arab, invasions, thus, under, the, pahlavi, state, these, ideas, of, aryan, and, pre, islamic, iranian, nationalism, continued, with, the, rise, of, reza, shah, under, the, last, shah, the, tomb, of, cyrus, the, great, was, established, as, a, significant, site, for, all, iranians, the, mission, for, my, country, written, by, the, shah, described, cyrus, as, one, of, the, most, dynamic, men, in, history, and, that, wherever, cyrus, conquered, he, would, pardon, the, very, people, who, had, fought, him, treat, them, well, and, keep, them, in, their, former, posts, while, iran, at, the, time, knew, nothing, of, democratic, political, institutions, cyrus, nevertheless, demonstrated, some, of, the, qualities, which, provide, the, strength, of, the, great, modern, democracies, the, cyrus, cylinder, also, became, an, important, cultural, symbol, and, pahlavi, successfully, popularized, the, decree, as, an, ancient, declaration, of, human, rights, the, shah, employed, titles, like, ry, mehr, and, sh, hansh, h, in, order, to, emphasize, iranian, supremacy, and, the, kings, of, iran, the, shah, continued, on, with, his, father, s, ideas, of, iranian, nationalism, concluding, arabs, as, the, utmost, other, nationalist, narratives, which, were, widely, accepted, by, a, majority, of, iranians, portraying, arabs, as, hostile, to, pahlavi, s, revival, of, modern, and, authentic, iran, in, the, 1970s, iran, had, an, economic, growth, rate, equal, to, that, of, south, korea, turkey, and, taiwan, and, western, journalists, all, regularly, predicted, that, iran, would, become, a, first, world, nation, within, the, next, generation, significantly, a, reverse, brain, drain, had, begun, with, iranians, who, had, been, educated, in, the, west, returning, home, to, take, up, positions, in, government, and, business, the, firm, of, iran, national, ran, by, the, khayami, brothers, had, become, by, 1978, the, largest, automobile, manufacturer, in, the, middle, east, producing, 136, 000, cars, every, year, while, employing, 12, 000, people, in, mashhad, mohammad, reza, had, strong, tatist, tendencies, and, was, deeply, involved, in, the, economy, with, his, economic, policies, bearing, a, strong, resemblance, to, the, same, tatist, policies, being, pursued, simultaneously, by, general, park, chung, hee, in, south, korea, mohammad, reza, considered, himself, to, be, a, socialist, saying, he, was, more, socialist, and, revolutionary, than, anyone, reflecting, his, self, proclaimed, socialist, tendencies, although, unions, were, illegal, the, shah, brought, in, labour, laws, that, were, surprisingly, fair, to, workers, iran, in, the, 1960s, and, 70s, was, a, tolerant, place, for, the, jewish, minority, with, one, iranian, jew, david, menasheri, remembering, that, mohammad, reza, s, reign, was, the, golden, age, for, iranian, jews, when, they, were, equals, and, when, the, iranian, jewish, community, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, jewish, communities, in, the, world, the, baha, i, minority, also, did, well, after, the, bout, of, persecution, in, the, mid, 1950s, ended, with, several, baha, i, families, rising, to, prominence, in, the, world, of, iranian, business, under, his, reign, iran, experienced, over, a, decade, of, double, digit, gdp, growth, coupled, with, major, investments, in, military, and, infrastructure, the, shah, s, first, economic, plan, was, geared, towards, large, infrastructure, projects, and, improving, the, agricultural, sector, which, led, to, the, development, of, many, major, dams, particularly, in, karaj, saf, dr, d, and, dez, the, next, economic, plan, was, directed, and, characterized, by, an, expansion, in, the, credit, and, monetary, policy, of, a, nation, which, resulted, in, a, rapid, expansion, of, iran, s, private, sector, particularly, construction, from, the,

landlords, valued, on, previous, tax, assessments, and, the, land, obtained, by, the, government, was, then, sold, on, favorable, terms, to, iranian, peasants, the, shah, also, initiated, the, nationalization, of, forests, and, pastures, female, suffrage, profit, sharing, for, industrial, workers, privatization, of, state, industries, and, formation, of, literacy, corps, these, developments, marked, a, turning, point, in, iranian, history, as, the, nation, prepared, to, embark, on, a, rapid, and, aggressive, industrialization, process, 1963, 1978, represented, the, longest,

1963, and, rose, to, 2, 060, by, 1977, the, growth, was, not, just, a, result, of, increased, oil, revenues, in, fact, the, non, oil, gdps, grew, by, an, average, annual, rate, of, 11, 5, percent,

mid, 1970s, iran, s, national, debt, was, paid, off, turning, the, nation, from, a, debtor, to, a, creditor, nation, the, balances, on, the, nation, s, account, for, the, 1959, 78, period, actually, resulted, in, a, surplus, of, funds, of, approximately, 15, 17, billion, the, shah, s, fifth, five, year, economic, plan, sought, to, achieve, a, reduction, in, foreign, imports, through, the, use, of, higher, tariffs, on, consumer, goods, preferential, bank, loans, to, the, industrialists, maintenance, of, an, overvalued, rial, and, food, subsidies, in, urban, areas, these, developments, led, to, the, development, of, a, new, large, industrialist, class, in, iran, and, the, nation, s, industrial, structure, was, extremely, insulated, from, threats, of, foreign, competition, in, 1976, iran, saw, its, largest, ever, gdp, uptick, thanks, in, large, part, to, the, shah, s, economic, policies, according, to, the, world, bank, when, valued, in, 2010, dollars, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, improved, the, country, s, per, capita, gdp, to, 10, 261, the, highest, at, any, point, in, iran, s, history, according, to, economist, fereydoun, khavand, during, these, 15, years, the, average, annual, growth, rate, of, the, country, fluctuated, above, 10, the, total, volume, of, iran, s, economy, increased, nearly, fivefold, during, this, period, in, contrast, during, the, past, 40, years, iran, s, average, annual, economic, growth, rate, has, been, only, about, two, percent, considering, the, growth, rate, of, iran, s, population, in, the, post, revolution, period, the, average, per, capita, growth, rate, of, iran, in, the, last, 40, years, is, estimated, between, zero, percent, and, half, a, percent, among, the, main, factors, hindering, the, growth, rate, in, iran, are, a, lack, of, a, favorable, business, environment, severe, investment, weakness, very, low, levels, of, productivity, and, constant, tension, in, the, country, s, regional, and, global, relations, many, european, american, and, japanese, investment, firms, sought, business, ventures, and, to, open, up, headquarters, in, iran, according, to, one, american, investment, banker, they, are, now, dependent, on, western, technology, but, what, happens, when, they, produce, and, export, steel, and, copper, when, they, reduce, their, agricultural, problems, they, ll, eat, everybody, else, in, the, middle, east, alive, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, iranian, oil, revenues, experienced, rapid, growth, by, the, mid, 1960s, iran, saw, weakened, u, s, influence, in, iranian, politics, and, a, strengthening, in, the, power, of, the, iranian, state, according, to, homa, katouzian, the, perception, that, the, us, was, the, instructor, of, the, shah, s, regime, due, to, their, support, for, the, 1953, coup, contradicted, the, reality, that, its, real, influence, in, domestic, iranian, politics, and, policy, declined, considerably, in, 1973, the, shah, initiated, an, oil, price, hike, with, his, control, of, opec, further, demonstrating, the, us, no, longer, had, influence, over, iranian, foreign, and, economic, policies, in, response, to, american, media, outlets, critical, of, him, the, shah, claimed, that, iran, s, oil, price, hikes, did, little, to, contribute, to, the, rising, inflation, in, the, united, states, pahlavi, also, implied, criticism, of, the, us, for, not, taking, the, lead, on, anti, communist, efforts, in, 1974, during, the, oil, crisis, the, shah, began, an, atomic, nuclear, energy, policy, prompting, us, trade, administrator, william, e, simon, to, denounce, the, shah, as, a, nut, in, response, us, president, nixon, publicly, apologized, to, the, shah, and, through, a, letter, in, order, to, disassociate, the, president, and, the, united, states, from, the, statement, simon, s, statement, illustrated, the, growing, american, tensions, with, iran, over, the, shah, s, raising, of, oil, prices, nixon, s, apology, covered, up, the, reality, that, the, shah, s, ambitions, to, become, the, leader, in, the, persian, gulf, area, and, the, indian, ocean, basin, was, placing, a, serious, strain, on, his, relationship, with, the, united, states, particularly, as, india, had, tested, its, first, atomic, bomb, in, may, 1974, many, critics, labeled, the, shah, as, a, western, and, american, puppet, an, accusation, that, has, been, disproven, as, unfounded, by, contemporary, scholars, due, to, the, shah, s, strong, regional, and, nationalist, ambitions, which, often, led, tehran, to, disputes, with, its, western, allies, in, particular, the, carter, administration, which, took, control, of, the, white, house, in, 1977, saw, the, shah, as, a, troublesome, ally, and, sought, change, in, iran, s, political, system, by, the, 1970s, the, shah, had, become, a, strongman, his, power, had, dramatically, increased, both, in, iran, and, internationally, and, on, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, white, revolution, he, challenged, the, consortium, agreement, of, 1954, and, terminated, the, agreement, after, negotiations, with, the, oil, consortium, resulting, in, the, establishment, of, 1973, sale, and, purchase, agreement, khomeini, accused, the, shah, of, false, rumors, and, employed, soviet, methods, of, deception, the, accusations, were, amplified, by, international, media, outlets, which, widely, propagated, the, information, and, protests, were, widely, shown, on, iranian, televisions, many, iranian, students, studied, across, western, europe, and, the, united, states, where, ideas, of, liberalism, democracy, and, counterculture, flourished, among, left, leaning, westerners, the, shah, s, reign, was, seen, as, equivalent, to, that, of, right, wing, hate, figures, western, anti, shah, fervor, broadcast, by, european, and, american, media, outlets, was, ultimately, adopted, by, iranian, students, and, intellectuals, studying, the, west, who, accused, the, shah, of, westoxification, when, it, was, the, students, themselves, who, were, adopting, western, liberalism, they, experienced, during, their, studies, these, western, ideas, of, liberalism, resulted, in, utopian, visions, for, revolution, and, social, change, in, turn, the, shah, criticized, western, democracies, and, equated, them, to, chaos, furthermore, the, shah, chastised, americans, and, europeans, as, being, lazy, and, lacking, discipline, and, criticized, their, student, radicalism, as, being, caused, by, western, decline, president, nixon, expressed, his, concern, to, the, shah, that, iranian, students, in, the, united, states, would, similarly, become, radicalized, asking, the, shah, are, your, students, infected, and, can, you, do, anything, in, 1961, the, francophile, mohammad, reza, visited, paris, to, meet, his, favourite, leader, general, charles, de, gaulle, of, france, mohammad, reza, saw, height, as, the, measure, of, a, man, and, a, woman, the, shah, had, a, marked, preference, for, tall, women, and, the, 6, feet, 5, inches, 1, 96, m, de, gaulle, was, his, most, admired, leader, mohammad, reza, loved, to, be, compared, to, his, ego, ideal, of, general, de, gaulle, and, his, courtiers, constantly, flattered, him, by, calling, him, iran, s, de, gaulle, during, the, french, trip, queen, farah, who, shared, her, husband, s, love, of, french, culture, and, language, befriended, the, culture, minister, andr, malraux, who, arranged, for, the, exchange, of, cultural, artifacts, between, french, and, iranian, museums, and, art, galleries, a, policy, that, remained, a, key, component, of, iran, s, cultural, diplomacy, until, 1979, many, of, the, legitimising, devices, of, the, regime, such, as, the, constant, use, of, referendums, were, modelled, after, de, gaulle, s, regime, intense, francophiles, mohammad, reza, and, farah, preferred, to, speak, french, rather, than, persian, to, their, children, mohammad, reza, built, the, niavaran, palace, which, took, up, 840, square, metres, 9, 000, sq, ft, and, whose, style, was, a, blend, of, persian, and, french, architecture, the, shah, s, diplomatic, foundation, was, the, united, states, guarantee, that, it, would, protect, his, regime, enabling, him, to, stand, up, to, larger, enemies, while, the, arrangement, did, not, preclude, other, partnerships, and, treaties, it, helped, to, provide, a, somewhat, stable, environment, in, which, mohammad, reza, could, implement, his, reforms, another, factor, guiding, mohammad, reza, in, his, foreign, policy, was, his, wish, for, financial, stability, which, required, strong, diplomatic, ties, a, third, factor, was, his, wish, to, present, iran, as, a, prosperous, and, powerful, nation, this, fuelled, his, domestic, policy, of, westernisation, and, reform, a, final, component, was, his, promise, that, communism, could, be, halted, at, iran, s, border, if, his, monarchy, was, preserved, by, 1977, the, country, s, treasury, the, shah, s, autocracy, and, his, strategic, alliances, seemed, to, form, a, protective, layer, around, iran, although, the, u, s, was, responsible, for, putting, the, shah, in, power, he, did, not, always, act, as, a, close, american, ally, in, the, early, 1960s, when, the, state, department, s, policy, planning, staff, that, included, william, r, polk, encouraged, the, shah, to, distribute, iran, s, growing, revenues, more, equitably, slow, the, rush, toward, militarisation, and, open, the, government, to, political, processes, he, became, furious, and, identified, polk, as, the, principal, enemy, of, his, regime, in, july, 1964, the, shah, turkish, president, cemal, g, rsel, and, pakistani, president, ayub, khan, announced, in, istanbul, the, establishment, of, the, regional, cooperation, for, development, rcd, organisation, to, promote, joint, transportation, and, economic, projects, it, also, envisioned, afghanistan, s, joining, at, some, time, in, the, future, the, shah, was, the, first, regional, leader, to, grant, de, facto, recognition, to, israel, when, interviewed, on, 60, minutes, by, reporter, mike, wallace, he, criticised, american, jews, for, their, presumed, control, over, u, s, media, and, finance, saying, that, the, new, york, times, and, the, washington, post, were, so, pro, israel, in, their, coverage, that, it, was, a, disservice, to, israel, s, own, interests, he, also, said, that, the, palestinians, were, bully, the, world, through, terrorism, and, blackmail, the, shah, s, remarks, on, the, alleged, jewish, lobby, are, widely, believed, to, have, been, intended, to, pacify, the, shah, s, arab, critics, and, in, any, case, bilateral, relations, between, iran, and, israel, were, not, adversely, affected, in, a, 1967, memo, to, president, lyndon, b, johnson, u, s, defense, secretary, robert, mcnamara, wrote, that, our, sales, have, created, about, 1, 4, million, man, years, of, employment, in, the, u, s, and, over, 1, billion, in, profits, to, american, industry, over, the, last, five, years, leading, him, to, conclude, that, iran, was, an, arms, market, the, united, states, could, not, do, without, in, june, 1965, after, the, americans, proved, reluctant, to, sell, mohammad, reza, some, of, the, weapons, he, asked, for, the, shah, visited, moscow, where, the, soviets, agreed, to, sell, some, 110, million, worth, of, weaponry, the, threat, of, iran, pursuing, the, soviet, option, caused, the, americans, to, resume, selling, iran, weapons, additionally, british, french, and, italian, arms, firms, were, willing, to, sell, iran, weapons, thus, giving, mohammad, reza, considerable, leverage, in, his, talks, with, the, americans, who, sometimes, worried, that, the, shah, was, buying, more, weapons, than, iran, needed, or, could, handle, concerning, the, fate, of, bahrain, which, britain, had, controlled, since, the, 19th, century, but, which, iran, claimed, as, its, own, territory, and, three, small, persian, gulf, islands, the, shah, negotiated, an, agreement, with, the, british, which, by, means, of, a, public, consensus, ultimately, led, to, the, independence, of, bahrain, against, the, wishes, of, iranian, nationalists, in, return, iran, took, full, control, of, greater, and, lesser, tunbs, and, abu, musa, in, the, strait, of, hormuz, three, strategically, sensitive, islands, which, were, claimed, by, the, united, arab, emirates, during, this, period, the, shah, sent, one, of, his, most, trusted, tribal, men, sheikh, abdulkarim, al, faisali, and, maintained, cordial, relations, with, the, persian, gulf, states, and, established, close, diplomatic, ties, with, saudi, arabia, mohammad, reza, saw, iran, as, the, natural, dominant, power, in, the, persian, gulf, region, and, tolerated, no, challenges, to, iranian, hegemony, a, claim, that, was, supported, by, a, gargantuan, arms, buying, spree, that, started, in, the, early, 1960s, mohammad, reza, supported, the, yemeni, royalists, against, republican, forces, in, the, yemen, civil, war, 1962, 70, and, assisted, the, sultan, of, oman, in, putting, down, a, rebellion, in, dhofar, 1971, in, 1971, mohammad, reza, told, a, journalist, world, events, were, such, that, we, were, compelled, to, accept, the, fact, that, sea, adjoining, the, oman, sea, i, mean, the, indian, ocean, does, not, recognise, borders, as, for, iran, s, security, limits, i, will, not, state, how, many, kilometers, we, have, in, mind, but, anyone, who, is, acquainted, with, geography, and, the, strategic, situation, and, especially, with, the, potential, air, and, sea, forces, know, what, distances, from, chah, bahar, this, limit, can, reach, from, 1968, to, 1975, the, iraq, deported, over, 60, 000, iraqis, of, iranian, descent, into, iran, causing, a, rise, in, tensions, iran, s, relations, with, iraq, however, were, often, difficult, due, to, political, instability, in, the, latter, country, mohammad, reza, was, distrustful, of, both, the, socialist, government, of, abd, al, karim, qasim, and, the, arab, nationalist, ba, ath, party, he, resented, the, internationally, recognised, iran, iraq, border, on, the, shatt, al, arab, river, which, a, 1937, treaty, fixed, on, the, low, watermark, on, the, iranian, side, giving, iraq, control, of, most, of, the, shatt, al, arab, on, 19, april, 1969, the, shah, abrogated, the, treaty, and, as, a, result, iran, ceased, paying, tolls, to, iraq, when, its, ships, used, the, shatt, al, arab, ending, iraq, s, lucrative, source, of, income, he, justified, his, move, by, arguing, that, almost, all, river, borders, all, over, the, world, ran, along, the, thalweg, deep, channel, mark, and, by, claiming, that, because, most, of, the, ships, that, used, the, shatt, al, arab, were, iranian, the, 1937, treaty, was, unfair, to, iran, iraq, threatened, war, over, the, iranian, move, but, when, on, 24, april, 1969, an, iranian, tanker, escorted, by, iranian, warships, sailed, down, the, shatt, al, arab, without, paying, tolls, iraq, being, the, militarily, weaker, state, did, nothing, the, iranian, abrogation, of, the, 1937, treaty, marked, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, acute, iraqi, iranian, tension, that, was, to, last, until, the, algiers, accords, of, 1975, the, fact, that, iraq, had, welcomed, the, former, savak, chief, general, teymur, bakhtiar, to, baghdad, where, he, regularly, met, with, representatives, of, the, tudeh, party, and, the, confederation, of, iranian, students, added, to, the, difficult, relations, between, iran, and, iraq, on, 7, august, 1970, bakhtiar, was, badly, wounded, by, a, savak, assassin, who, shot, him, five, times, and, he, died, five, days, later, alam, wrote, in, his, diary, that, mohammad, reza, rejoiced, at, the, news, on, 7, may, 1972, mohammad, reza, told, a, visiting, president, richard, nixon, that, the, soviet, union, was, attempting, to, dominate, the, middle, east, via, its, close, ally, iraq, and, that, to, check, iraqi, ambitions, would, also, be, to, check, soviet, ambitions, nixon, agreed, to, support, iranian, claims, to, have, the, thalweg, in, the, shatt, al, arab, recognised, as, the, border, and, to, generally, back, iran, in, its, confrontation, with, iraq, mohammad, reza, financed, kurdish, separatist, rebels, in, iraq, and, to, cover, his, tracks, armed, them, with, soviet, weapons, which, israel, had, seized, from, soviet, backed, arab, regimes, then, handed, over, to, iran, at, the, shah, s, behest, the, initial, operation, was, a, disaster, but, the, shah, continued, attempts, to, support, the, rebels, and, weaken, iraq, then, in, 1975, the, countries, signed, the, algiers, accord, which, granted, iran, equal, navigation, rights, in, the, shatt, al, arab, as, the, thalweg, was, now, the, new, border, while, mohammad, reza, agreed, to, end, his, support, for, iraqi, kurdish, rebels, the, shah, also, maintained, close, relations, with, king, hussein, of, jordan, president, anwar, sadat, of, egypt, and, king, hassan, ii, of, morocco, beginning, in, 1970, mohammad, reza, formed, an, unlikely, alliance, with, the, militantly, left, wing, regime, of, colonel, muammar, gaddafi, of, libya, as, both, leaders, wanted, higher, oil, prices, for, their, nations, leading, iran, and, libya, joining, forces, to, press, for, the, leapfrogging, of, oil, prices, the, u, s, iran, relationship, grew, more, contentious, as, the, u, s, became, more, dependent, on, mohammad, reza, to, be, a, stabilising, force, in, the, middle, east, under, the, nixon, doctrine, in, a, july, 1969, visit, to, guam, president, nixon, had, announced, the, nixon, doctrine, which, declared, that, the, united, states, would, honour, its, treaty, commitments, in, asia, but, as, far, as, the, problems, of, international, security, are, concerned, the, united, states, is, going, to, encourage, and, has, a, right, to, expect, that, this, problem, will, increasingly, be, handled, by, and, the, responsibility, for, it, taken, by, the, asian, nations, themselves, the, particular, asian, nation, the, nixon, doctrine, was, aimed, at, was, south, vietnam, but, the, shah, seized, upon, the, doctrine, with, its, message, that, asian, nations, should, be, responsible, for, their, own, defense, to, argue, that, the, americans, should, sell, him, arms, without, limitation, a, suggestion, that, nixon, embraced, a, particular, dynamic, was, established, in, american, iranian, relations, from, 1969, onward, in, which, the, americans, gave, in, to, whatever, mohammad, reza, demanded, as, they, felt, they, needed, a, strong, iran, as, a, pro, american, force, in, the, middle, east, and, could, not, afford, to, lose, iran, as, an, ally, further, adding, to, the, shah, s, confidence, was, the, sino, soviet, border, conflict, of, 1969, which, forced, the, red, army, to, make, a, major, redeployment, to, the, chinese, border, mohammad, reza, who, always, feared, the, prospect, of, a, soviet, invasion, welcomed, the, sino, soviet, war, and, the, resulting, reduction, of, red, army, divisions, along, the, soviet, iranian, border, as, giving, him, more, room, internationally, under, nixon, the, united, states, finally, agreed, to, sever, all, contact, with, any, iranians, opposed, to, the, shah, s, regime, a, concession, that, mohammad, reza, had, been, seeking, since, 1958, the, often, very, anti, american, tone, of, the, iranian, press, was, ignored, because, mohammad, reza, supported, the, u, s, in, the, vietnam, war, and, likewise, the, americans, ignored, the, shah, s, efforts, to, raise, oil, prices, despite, the, fact, it, cost, many, american, consumers, more, after, 1969, a, process, of, reverse, leverage, set, in, when, mohammad, reza, began, to, dictate, to, the, united, states, as, the, americans, needed, him, more, than, he, needed, the, americans, the, american, national, security, advisor, henry, kissinger, wrote, in, 1982, that, because, of, the, vietnam, war, it, was, not, politically, possible, in, the, 1970s, for, the, united, states, to, fight, a, major, war, there, was, no, possibility, of, assigning, any, american, forces, to, the, indian, ocean, in, the, midst, of, the, vietnam, war, and, its, attendant, trauma, congress, would, have, tolerated, no, such, commitment, the, public, would, not, have, supported, it, fortunately, iran, was, willing, to, play, this, role, consequently, the, americans, badly, needed, iran, as, an, ally, which, allowed, mohammad, reza, to, dictate, to, them, this, experience, greatly, boosted, the, shah, s, ego, as, he, felt, he, was, able, to, impose, his, will, on, the, world, s, most, powerful, nation, the, americans, initially, rejected, mohammad, reza, s, suggestion, that, they, join, him, in, supporting, the, iraqi, kurdish, peshmerga, fighting, for, independence, on, the, grounds, that, an, independent, kurdistan, would, inspire, the, turkish, kurds, to, rebel, and, they, had, no, interest, in, antagonising, the, nato, member, turkey, some, of, the, shah, s, advisers, also, felt, it, was, unwise, to, support, the, peshmerga, saying, that, if, the, iraqi, kurds, won, independence, then, the, iranian, kurds, would, want, to, join, them, when, nixon, and, kissinger, visited, tehran, in, may, 1972, the, shah, convinced, them, to, take, a, larger, role, in, what, had, up, to, then, been, a, mainly, israeli, iranian, operation, to, aid, iraqi, kurds, in, their, struggles, against, iraq, against, the, warnings, of, the, cia, and, state, department, that, the, shah, would, ultimately, betray, the, kurds, he, did, this, in, march, 1975, with, the, signing, of, the, algiers, accord, that, settled, iraqi, iranian, border, disputes, an, action, taken, without, prior, consultation, with, the, u, s, after, which, he, cut, off, all, aid, to, the, kurds, and, prevented, the, u, s, and, israel, from, using, iranian, territory, to, provide, them, assistance, as, a, way, of, increasing, pressure, on, baghdad, the, peshmerga, had, been, encouraged, by, iran, and, the, u, s, to, abandon, guerrilla, war, for, conventional, war, in, april, 1974, so, the, years, 1974, 75, saw, the, heaviest, fighting, between, the, iraqi, army, and, the, peshmerga, the, sudden, cut, off, of, iranian, support, in, march, 1975, left, the, kurds, very, exposed, causing, them, to, be, crushed, by, iraq, the, british, journalist, patrick, brogan, wrote, that, the, iraqis, celebrated, their, victory, in, the, usual, manner, by, executing, as, many, of, the, rebels, as, they, could, lay, their, hands, on, kissinger, later, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, it, was, never, the, intention, of, the, u, s, or, iran, to, see, the, peshmerga, actually, win, as, an, independent, kurdistan, would, have, created, too, many, problems, for, both, turkey, and, iran, rather, the, intention, was, to, irritate, iraq, enough, to, force, the, iraqis, to, change, their, foreign, policy, the, shah, also, used, america, s, dependence, on, middle, eastern, oil, as, leverage, although, iran, did, not, participate, in, the, 1973, oil, embargo, he, purposely, increased, production, in, its, aftermath, to, capitalise, on, the, higher, prices, in, december, 1973, only, two, months, after, oil, prices, were, raised, by, 70, per, cent, he, urged, opec, nations, to, push, prices, even, higher, which, they, agreed, to, do, more, than, doubling, the, price, oil, prices, increased, 470, per, cent, over, a, 12, month, period, which, also, increased, iran, s, gdp, by, 50, per, cent, despite, personal, pleas, from, president, nixon, the, shah, ignored, any, complaints, claimed, the, u, s, was, importing, more, oil, than, any, time, in, the, past, and, proclaimed, that, the, industrial, world, will, have, to, realise, that, the, era, of, their, terrific, progress, and, even, more, terrific, income, and, wealth, based, on, cheap, oil, is, finished, with, iran, s, great, oil, wealth, the, shah, became, the, preeminent, leader, of, the, middle, east, and, self, styled, guardian, of, the, persian, gulf, in, 1961, he, defended, his, style, of, rule, saying, when, iranians, learn, to, behave, like, swedes, i, will, behave, like, the, king, of, sweden, during, the, last, years, of, his, regime, the, shah, s, government, became, more, autocratic, in, the, words, of, a, u, s, embassy, dispatch, the, shah, s, picture, is, everywhere, the, beginning, of, all, film, showings, in, public, theaters, presents, the, shah, in, various, regal, poses, accompanied, by, the, strains, of, the, national, anthem, the, monarch, also, actively, extends, his, influence, to, all, phases, of, social, affairs, there, is, hardly, any, activity, or, vocation, in, which, the, shah, or, members, of, his, family, or, his, closest, friends, do, not, have, a, direct, or, at, least, a, symbolic, involvement, in, the, past, he, had, claimed, to, take, a, two, party, system, seriously, and, declared, if, i, were, a, dictator, rather, than, a, constitutional, monarch, then, i, might, be, tempted, to, sponsor, a, single, dominant, party, such, as, hitler, organised, however, by, 1975, mohammad, reza, had, abolished, the, two, party, system, of, government, in, favour, of, a, one, party, state, under, the, rastakhiz, resurrection, party, this, was, the, merger, of, the, new, iran, party, a, centre, right, party, and, the, people, s, party, a, liberal, party, the, shah, justified, his, actions, by, declaring, we, must, straighten, out, iranians, ranks, to, do, so, we, divide, them, into, two, categories, those, who, believe, in, monarchy, the, constitution, and, the, six, bahman, revolution, and, those, who, don, t, a, person, who, does, not, enter, the, new, political, party, and, does, not, believe, in, the, three, cardinal, principles, will, have, only, two, choices, he, is, either, an, individual, who, belongs, to, an, illegal, organisation, or, is, related, to, the, outlawed, tudeh, party, or, in, other, words, a, traitor, such, an, individual, belongs, to, an, iranian, prison, or, if, he, desires, he, can, leave, the, country, tomorrow, without, even, paying, exit, fees, he, can, go, anywhere, he, likes, because, he, is, not, iranian, he, has, no, nation, and, his, activities, are, illegal, and, punishable, according, to, the, law, in, addition, the, shah, had, decreed, that, all, iranian, citizens, and, the, few, remaining, political, parties, become, part, of, rastakhiz, from, 1973, onward, mohammad, reza, had, proclaimed, his, aim, as, that, of, the, tamaddon, e, bozorg, the, great, civilisation, a, turning, point, not, only, in, iran, s, history, but, also, the, history, of, the, entire, world, a, claim, that, was, taken, seriously, for, a, time, in, the, west, on, 2, december, 1974, the, new, yorker, published, an, article, by, paul, erdman, that, was, a, conjectural, future, history, entitled, the, oil, war, of, 1976, how, the, shah, won, the, world, the, world, as, we, knew, it, came, to, an, end, when, the, shah, of, iran, decided, to, restore, the, glory, of, ancient, persia, with, western, arms, in, 1975, u, s, vice, president, nelson, rockefeller, declared, in, a, speech, we, must, take, his, imperial, majesty, to, the, united, states, for, a, couple, of, years, so, that, he, can, teach, us, how, to, run, a, country, in, 1976, a, pulp, novel, by, alan, williams, was, published, in, the, united, states, under, the, title, a, bullet, for, the, shah, all, they, had, to, do, was, kill, the, world, s, most, powerful, man, whose, sub, title, reveals, much, about, how, the, american, people, viewed, the, shah, at, the, time, the, original, british, title, was, the, more, prosaic, shah, mak, the, great, wealth, generated, by, iran, s, oil, encouraged, a, sense, of, nationalism, at, the, imperial, court, the, empress, farah, recalled, of, her, days, as, a, university, student, in, 1950s, france, about, being, asked, where, she, was, from, when, i, told, them, iran, the, europeans, would, recoil, in, horror, as, if, iranians, were, barbarians, and, loathsome, but, after, iran, became, wealthy, under, the, shah, in, the, 1970s, iranians, were, courted, everywhere, yes, your, majesty, of, course, your, majesty, if, you, please, your, majesty, fawning, all, over, us, greedy, sycophants, then, they, loved, iranians, mohammad, reza, shared, the, empress, s, sentiments, as, westerners, came, begging, to, his, court, looking, for, his, largesse, leading, him, to, remark, in, 1976, now, we, are, the, masters, and, our, former, masters, are, our, slaves, everyday, they, beat, a, track, to, our, door, begging, for, favors, how, can, they, be, of, assistance, do, we, want, arms, do, we, want, nuclear, power, stations, we, have, only, to, answer, and, they, will, fulfill, our, wishes, because, the, house, of, pahlavi, were, a, parvenu, house, as, reza, khan, had, begun, his, career, as, a, private, in, the, persian, army, rising, up, to, the, rank, of, general, taking, power, in, a, coup, d, tat, in, 1921, and, making, himself, shah, in, 1925, mohammad, reza, was, keen, to, gain, the, approval, of, the, older, royal, families, of, the, world, and, was, prepared, to, spend, large, sums, of, money, to, gain, that, social, acceptance, amongst, the, royalty, that, came, to, tehran, looking, for, the, shah, s, generosity, were, king, hussein, of, jordan, the, former, king, constantine, ii, of, greece, king, hassan, ii, of, morocco, the, princes, and, princesses, of, the, dutch, house, of, orange, and, the, italian, princess, maria, gabriella, of, savoy, whom, the, shah, had, once, courted, in, the, 1950s, he, coveted, the, british, order, of, the, garter, and, had, prior, to, courting, maria, gabriella, inquired, about, marrying, princess, alexandra, of, kent, granddaughter, of, king, george, v, but, in, both, cases, he, was, rebuffed, in, no, uncertain, terms, as, an, iranian, mohammad, reza, greatly, enjoyed, supporting, the, greek, branch, of, the, house, of, gl, cksburg, knowing, the, greeks, still, celebrated, their, victories, over, the, persians, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, he, enjoyed, close, relations, with, emperor, haile, selassie, of, ethiopia, as, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, he, was, the, guest, of, honour, at, the, persepolis, celebrations, in, 1971, ethiopia, and, iran, along, with, turkey, and, israel, were, envisioned, as, an, alliance, of, the, periphery, that, would, constrain, arab, power, in, the, greater, middle, east, in, an, era, of, high, oil, prices, iran, s, economy, boomed, while, the, economies, of, the, western, nations, were, trapped, in, stagflation, economic, stagnation, and, inflation, after, the, 1973, 74, oil, shocks, which, seemed, to, prove, the, greatness, of, mohammad, reza, both, to, himself, and, to, the, rest, of, the, world, in, 1975, both, the, british, prime, minister, harold, wilson, and, the, french, president, val, ry, giscard, d, estaing, made, pleading, phone, calls, to, mohammad, reza, asking, him, for, loans, which, ultimately, led, the, shah, to, give, a, us, 1, billion, loan, to, the, united, kingdom, and, another, us, 1, billion, to, france, in, a, televised, speech, in, january, 1975, explaining, why, he, was, lending, britain, a, sum, equal, to, us, 1, billion, mohammad, reza, declared, in, his, usual, grandiose, style, i, have, known, the, most, dark, hours, when, our, country, was, obliged, to, pass, under, the, tutelage, of, foreign, powers, amongst, them, england, now, i, find, that, england, has, not, only, become, our, friend, our, equal, but, also, the, nation, to, which, should, we, be, able, we, will, render, assistance, with, pleasure, going, on, to, say, that, since, he, belonged, to, this, world, he, did, not, want, europe, to, collapse, economically, as, britain, had, often, dominated, iran, in, the, past, the, change, in, roles, was, greatly, gratifying, to, mohammad, reza, courtiers, at, the, imperial, court, were, devoted, to, stroking, the, shah, s, ego, competing, to, be, the, most, sycophantic, with, mohammad, reza, being, regularly, assured, he, was, a, greater, leader, than, his, much, admired, general, de, gaulle, that, democracy, was, doomed, and, that, based, on, rockefeller, s, speech, that, the, american, people, wanted, mohammad, reza, to, be, their, leader, as, well, as, doing, such, a, great, job, as, shah, of, iran, according, to, historian, abbas, milani, all, of, this, praise, boosted, mohammad, reza, s, ego, and, he, went, from, being, a, merely, narcissistic, man, to, a, megalomaniac, believing, himself, a, man, chosen, by, allah, himself, to, transform, iran, and, create, the, great, civilisation, when, one, of, the, shah, s, courtiers, suggested, launching, a, campaign, to, award, him, the, nobel, peace, prize, he, wrote, on, the, margin, if, they, beg, us, we, might, accept, they, give, the, nobel, to, kaka, siah, these, days, why, should, we, belittle, ourselves, with, this, befitting, all, this, attention, and, praise, mohammad, reza, started, to, make, increasingly, outlandish, claims, for, the, great, civilisation, telling, the, italian, journalist, oriana, fallaci, in, a, 1973, interview, with, l, europeo, halfway, measures, compromises, are, unfeasible, in, other, words, either, one, is, a, revolutionary, or, one, demands, law, and, order, one, can, t, be, a, revolutionary, with, law, and, order, and, even, less, with, tolerance, when, castro, came, to, power, he, killed, at, least, 10, 000, people, in, a, sense, he, was, really, capable, because, he, s, still, in, power, so, am, i, however, and, i, intend, to, stay, there, and, to, demonstrate, that, one, can, achieve, a, great, many, things, by, the, use, of, force, show, even, that, your, old, socialism, is, finished, old, obsolete, finished, i, achieve, more, than, the, swedes, huh, swedish, socialism, it, didn, t, even, nationalize, forests, and, water, but, i, have, my, white, revolution, is, a, new, original, kind, of, socialism, and, believe, me, in, iran, we, re, far, more, advanced, than, you, and, we, really, have, nothing, to, learn, from, you, in, an, interview, with, der, spiegel, published, on, 3, february, 1974, mohammad, reza, declared, i, would, like, you, to, know, that, in, our, case, our, actions, are, not, just, to, take, vengeance, on, the, west, as, i, said, we, are, going, to, be, a, member, of, your, club, in, a, press, conference, on, 31, march, 1974, mohammad, reza, predicted, what, iran, would, be, like, in, 1984, saying, in, the, cities, electric, cars, would, replace, the, gas, engines, and, mass, transportation, systems, would, be, switched, to, electricity, monorail, over, the, ground, or, electric, buses, and, furthermore, in, the, great, era, of, civilization, that, lies, ahead, of, our, people, there, will, be, least, two, or, three, holidays, a, week, in, 1976, mohammad, reza, told, the, egyptian, journalist, mohamed, hassanein, heikal, in, an, interview, i, want, the, standard, of, living, in, iran, in, ten, years, time, to, be, exactly, on, a, level, with, that, in, europe, today, in, twenty, years, time, we, shall, be, ahead, of, the, united, states, reflecting, his, need, to, have, iran, seen, as, part, of, the, world, by, which, mohammad, reza, meant, the, western, world, all, through, the, 1970s, he, sponsored, conferences, in, iran, at, his, expense, with, for, example, in, one, week, in, september, 1975, the, international, literacy, symposium, meeting, in, persepolis, the, international, congress, of, philosophy, meeting, in, mashhad, and, the, international, congress, of, mithraic, studies, meeting, in, tehran, he, also, sought, to, hold, the, 1984, summer, olympics, in, tehran, for, most, ordinary, iranians, struggling, with, inflation, poverty, air, pollution, having, to, pay, extortion, payments, to, the, police, who, demanded, money, from, even, those, performing, legal, jobs, such, as, selling, fruits, on, the, street, and, daily, traffic, jams, the, shah, s, sponsorship, of, international, conferences, were, just, a, waste, of, money, and, time, furthermore, conferences, on, pre, islamic, practices, such, as, the, cult, of, mithra, fuelled, religious, anxieties, though, mohammad, reza, envisioned, the, great, civilisation, of, a, modernised, iran, whose, standard, of, living, would, be, higher, than, those, of, the, united, states, and, at, the, forefront, of, modern, technology, he, did, not, envision, any, political, change, making, it, clear, that, iran, would, remain, an, autocracy, in, his, white, revolution, starting, in, the, 1960s, mohammad, reza, made, major, changes, to, modernise, iran, he, curbed, the, power, of, certain, ancient, elite, factions, by, expropriating, large, and, medium, sized, estates, for, the, benefit, of, more, than, four, million, small, farmers, he, took, a, number, of, other, major, measures, including, extending, suffrage, to, women, and, the, participation,

all, sorts, of, rumors, about, the, state, of, his, health, and, damaged, the, imperial, mystique, as, the, man, who, had, been, presented, as, a, god, like, ruler, was, revealed, to, be, fallible, a, july, 1978, attempt, to, deny, the, rumors, of, mohammad, reza, s, declining, health, by, publishing, a, crudely, doctored, photograph, in, the, newspapers, of, the, emperor, and, empress, walking, on, the, beach, instead, further, damaged, the, imperial, mystique, as, most, people, realised, that, what, appeared, to, be, two, beach, clogs, on, either, side, of, the, shah, were, merely, substitutes, inserted, for, his, airbrushed, aides, who, were, holding, him, up, as, he, now, had, difficulty, walking, by, himself, in, june, 1978, mohammad, reza, s, french, doctors, first, revealed, to, the, french, government, how, serious, his, cancer, was, and, in, september, the, french, government, informed, the, american, government, that, the, shah, was, dying, of, cancer, until, then, u, s, officials, had, no, idea, that, mohammad, reza, had, even, been, diagnosed, with, cancer, four, years, earlier, the, shah, had, created, a, very, centralised, system, in, which, he, was, the, key, decision, maker, on, all, issues, and, as, historian, abbas, milani, noted, he, was, mentally, crippled, in, the, summer, of, 1978, owing, to, his, tendency, to, be, indecisive, when, faced, with, a, crisis, which, combined, with, his, cancer, and, the, effects, of, the, anti, cancer, drugs, made, his, mood, increasingly, volatile, and, unpredictable, one, day, he, was, full, of, verve, and, optimism, and, the, next, day, or, hour, he, fell, into, a, catatonic, stupor, bringing, the, entire, government, to, a, halt, milani, wrote, that, the, shah, was, in, 1978, beset, with, depression, indecision, and, paralysis, and, his, indecision, led, to, the, immobilisation, of, the, entire, system, empress, farah, grew, so, frustrated, with, her, husband, that, she, suggested, numerous, times, that, he, leave, iran, for, medical, treatment, and, appoint, her, regent, saying, she, would, handle, the, crisis, and, save, the, house, of, pahlavi, mohammad, reza, vetoed, this, idea, saying, he, did, not, want, farah, to, be, joan, of, arc, and, it, would, be, too, humiliating, for, him, as, a, man, to, flee, iran, and, leave, a, woman, in, charge, the, shah, centred, command, structure, of, the, iranian, military, and, the, lack, of, training, to, confront, civil, unrest, was, marked, by, disaster, and, bloodshed, there, were, several, instances, where, army, units, had, opened, fire, the, most, significant, being, the, events, on, 8, september, 1978, hoping, to, calm, the, situation, on, 2, october, 1978, the, shah, granted, a, general, amnesty, to, dissidents, living, abroad, including, ayatollah, khomeini, but, by, then, it, was, too, late, october, 1978, was, characterized, by, extreme, unrest, and, open, opposition, to, the, monarchy, strikes, paralyzed, the, country, and, in, early, december, a, total, of, 6, to, 9, million, more, than, 10, of, the, country, marched, against, the, shah, throughout, iran, in, october, 1978, after, flying, over, a, huge, demonstration, in, tehran, in, his, helicopter, mohammad, reza, accused, the, british, ambassador, sir, anthony, parsons, and, the, american, ambassador, william, h, sullivan, of, organising, the, demonstrations, screaming, that, he, was, being, betrayed, by, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, the, fact, that, the, bbc, s, journalists, tended, to, be, very, sympathetic, towards, the, revolution, was, viewed, by, most, iranians, including, mohammad, reza, as, a, sign, that, britain, was, supporting, the, revolution, this, impression, turned, out, to, be, crucial, as, the, iranian, people, had, a, very, exaggerated, idea, about, britain, s, capacity, to, direct, events, in, iran, in, a, subsequent, internal, inquiry, the, bbc, found, many, of, its, more, left, wing, journalists, disliked, mohammad, reza, as, a, reactionary, force, and, sympathised, with, a, revolution, seen, as, progressive, mohammad, reza, spent, much, of, his, time, working, out, various, conspiracy, theories, about, who, was, behind, the, revolution, with, his, favourite, candidates, being, some, combination, of, britain, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, milani, wrote, that, mohammad, reza, s, view, of, the, revolution, as, a, gigantic, conspiracy, organised, by, foreign, powers, suggested, that, there, was, nothing, wrong, with, iran, and, the, millions, of, people, demonstrating, against, him, were, just, dupes, being, used, by, foreigners, a, viewpoint, that, did, not, encourage, concessions, and, reforms, until, it, was, too, late, for, much, of, 1978, mohammad, reza, saw, his, enemies, as, marxist, revolutionaries, rather, than, islamists, the, shah, had, exaggerated, ideas, about, the, power, of, the, kgb, which, he, thought, of, as, omnipotent, and, often, expressed, the, view, that, all, of, the, demonstrations, against, him, had, been, organised, in, moscow, saying, only, the, kgb, had, the, power, to, bring, out, thousands, of, ordinary, people, to, demonstrate, in, october, 1978, the, oil, workers, went, on, strike, shutting, down, the, oil, industry, and, with, it, mohammad, reza, s, principal, source, of, revenue, the, iranian, military, had, no, plans, in, place, to, deal, with, such, an, event, and, the, strike, pushed, the, regime, to, the, economic, brink, the, revolution, had, attracted, support, from, a, broad, coalition, ranging, from, secular, far, left, nationalists, to, islamists, on, the, right, and, khomeini, who, was, temporarily, based, in, paris, after, being, expelled, from, iraq, chose, to, present, himself, as, a, moderate, able, to, bring, together, all, the, different, factions, leading, the, revolution, on, 3, november, a, savak, plan, to, arrest, about, 1, 500, people, considered, to, be, leaders, of, the, revolution, was, submitted, to, mohammad, reza, who, at, first, tentatively, agreed, but, then, changed, his, mind, disregarding, not, only, the, plan, but, also, dismissing, its, author, parviz, sabeti, on, 5, november, 1978, mohammad, reza, went, on, iranian, television, to, say, i, have, heard, the, voice, of, your, revolution, and, promise, major, reforms, in, a, major, concession, to, the, opposition, on, 7, november, 1978, mohammad, reza, freed, all, political, prisoners, while, ordering, the, arrest, of, the, former, prime, minister, amir, abbas, hoveyda, and, several, senior, officials, of, his, regime, a, move, that, both, emboldened, his, opponents, and, demoralised, his, supporters, on, 21, november, 1978, the, treasury, secretary, of, the, united, states, michael, blumenthal, visited, tehran, to, meet, mohammad, reza, and, reported, back, to, president, jimmy, carter, this, man, is, a, ghost, as, by, now, the, ravages, of, his, cancer, could, no, longer, be, concealed, in, late, december, 1978, the, shah, learned, that, many, of, his, generals, were, making, overtures, to, the, revolutionary, leaders, and, the, loyalty, of, the, military, could, no, longer, be, assured, in, a, sign, of, desperation, the, following, month, mohammad, reza, reached, out, to, the, national, front, asking, if, one, of, their, leaders, would, be, willing, to, become, prime, minister, the, shah, was, especially, interested, in, having, the, national, front, s, gholam, hossein, sadighi, as, prime, minister, sadighi, had, served, as, interior, minister, under, mosaddegh, had, been, imprisoned, after, the, 1953, coup, and, pardoned, by, mohammad, reza, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, a, patriot, sadighi, remained, active, in, the, national, front, and, had, often, been, harassed, by, savak, but, was, willing, to, serve, as, prime, minister, under, mohammad, reza, in, order, to, save, iran, saying, he, feared, what, might, come, after, if, the, shah, was, overthrown, despite, the, opposition, of, the, other, national, front, leaders, sadighi, visited, the, niavaran, palace, several, times, in, december, 1978, to, discuss, the, terms, under, which, he, might, become, prime, minister, with, the, main, sticking, point, being, that, he, wanted, the, shah, not, to, leave, iran, saying, he, needed, to, remain, in, order, to, ensure, the, loyalty, of, the, military, on, 7, december, 1978, it, was, announced, that, president, carter, of, the, u, s, president, val, ry, giscard, d, estaing, of, france, chancellor, helmut, schmidt, of, west, germany, and, prime, minister, james, callaghan, of, the, united, kingdom, would, meet, in, guadeloupe, on, 5, january, 1979, to, discuss, the, crisis, in, iran, for, mohammad, reza, this, announcement, was, the, final, blow, and, he, was, convinced, that, the, western, leaders, were, holding, the, meeting, to, discuss, how, best, to, abandon, him, on, 16, january, 1979, mohammad, reza, shah, made, a, contract, with, farboud, and, left, iran, at, the, behest, of, prime, minister, shapour, bakhtiar, a, longtime, opposition, leader, himself, who, sought, to, calm, the, situation, as, mohammad, reza, boarded, the, plane, to, take, him, out, of, iran, many, of, the, imperial, guardsmen, wept, while, bakhtiar, did, little, to, hide, his, disdain, and, dislike, for, the, shah, spontaneous, attacks, by, members, of, the, public, on, statues, of, the, pahlavis, followed, and, within, hours, almost, every, sign, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, was, destroyed, bakhtiar, dissolved, savak, freed, all, political, prisoners, and, allowed, ayatollah, khomeini, to, return, to, iran, after, years, in, exile, he, asked, khomeini, to, create, a, vatican, like, state, in, qom, promised, free, elections, and, called, upon, the, opposition, to, help, preserve, the, constitution, proposing, a, national, unity, government, including, khomeini, s, followers, khomeini, rejected, bakhtiar, s, demands, and, appointed, his, own, interim, government, with, mehdi, bazargan, as, prime, minister, stating, that, i, will, appoint, a, state, i, will, act, against, this, government, with, the, nation, s, support, i, will, appoint, a, state, in, february, pro, khomeini, revolutionary, guerrilla, and, rebel, soldiers, gained, the, upper, hand, in, street, fighting, and, the, military, announced, its, neutrality, on, the, evening, of, 11, february, the, dissolution, of, the, monarchy, was, complete, the, u, s, state, department, drew, criticism, for, doing, little, to, communicate, with, tehran, or, discourage, protest, and, opposition, to, the, shah, the, intelligence, community, within, the, us, has, also, been, subject, to, criticism, particularly, for, reporting, to, president, jimmy, carter, iran, is, not, in, a, revolutionary, or, even, a, pre, revolutionary, situation, president, jimmy, carter, was, also, blamed, for, his, lack, of, support, for, the, shah, while, failing, to, deter, opposition, within, iran, the, revolution, is, widely, believed, to, have, been, a, british, plot, to, overthrow, the, shah, this, theory, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, 1979, iranian, revolution, conspiracy, theory, the, theory, was, supported, by, the, shah, of, iran, who, believed, his, increasing, control, over, oil, markets, and, his, 1973, nationalization, of, iranian, oil, prompted, international, oil, companies, to, unseat, him, an, amnesty, international, assessment, on, iran, for, 1974, 1975, stated, the, total, number, of, political, prisoners, has, been, reported, at, times, throughout, the, year, to, be, anything, from, 25, 000, to, 100, 000, at, the, federation, of, american, scientists, john, pike, writes, in, 1978, the, deepening, opposition, to, the, shah, erupted, in, widespread, demonstrations, and, rioting, recognising, that, even, this, level, of, violence, had, failed, to, crush, the, rebellion, the, shah, abdicated, the, peacock, throne, and, fled, iran, on, 16, january, 1979, despite, decades, of, pervasive, surveillance, by, savak, working, closely, with, cia, the, extent, of, public, opposition, to, the, shah, and, his, sudden, departure, came, as, a, considerable, surprise, to, the, us, intelligence, community, and, national, leadership, as, late, as, 28, september, 1978, the, us, defense, intelligence, agency, reported, that, the, shah, is, expected, to, remain, actively, in, power, over, the, next, ten, years, explanations, for, the, overthrow, of, mohammad, reza, include, his, status, as, a, dictator, put, in, place, by, a, non, muslim, western, power, the, united, states, whose, foreign, culture, was, seen, as, influencing, that, of, iran, additional, contributing, factors, included, reports, of, oppression, brutality, corruption, and, extravagance, basic, functional, failures, of, the, regime, have, also, been, blamed, economic, bottlenecks, shortages, and, inflation, the, regime, s, over, ambitious, economic, programme, the, failure, of, its, security, forces, to, deal, with, protests, and, demonstrations, and, the, overly, centralised, royal, power, structure, international, policies, pursued, by, the, shah, in, order, to, increase, national, income, by, remarkable, increases, in, the, price, of, oil, through, his, leading, role, in, the, organization, of, the, oil, producing, countries, opec, have, been, stressed, as, a, major, cause, for, a, shift, of, western, interests, and, priorities, and, for, a, reduction, of, their, support, for, him, reflected, in, a, critical, position, of, western, politicians, and, media, especially, of, the, administration, of, u, s, president, jimmy, carter, regarding, the, question, of, human, rights, in, iran, and, in, strengthened, economic, ties, between, the, united, states, of, america, and, saudi, arabia, in, the, 1970s, in, october, 1971, mohammad, reza, celebrated, the, twenty, five, hundredth, anniversary, of, the, iranian, monarchy, the, new, york, times, reported, that, 100, million, was, spent, on, the, celebration, next, to, the, ancient, ruins, of, persepolis, the, shah, gave, orders, to, build, a, tent, city, covering, 160, acres, 0, 65, km, 2, studded, with, three, huge, royal, tents, and, fifty, nine, lesser, ones, arranged, in, a, star, shaped, design, french, chefs, from, maxim, s, of, paris, prepared, breast, of, peacock, for, royalty, and, dignitaries, from, around, the, world, the, buildings, were, decorated, by, maison, jansen, the, same, firm, that, helped, jacqueline, kennedy, redecorate, the, white, house, the, guests, ate, off, limoges, porcelain, and, drank, from, baccarat, crystal, glasses, this, became, a, major, scandal, as, the, contrast, between, the, dazzling, elegance, of, the, celebration, and, the, misery, of, the, nearby, villages, was, so, dramatic, that, no, one, could, ignore, it, months, before, the, festivities, university, students, went, on, strike, in, protest, indeed, the, cost, was, so, sufficiently, impressive, that, the, shah, forbade, his, associates, to, discuss, the, actual, figures, however, he, and, his, supporters, argued, that, the, celebrations, opened, new, investments, in, iran, improved, relationships, with, the, other, leaders, and, nations, of, the, world, and, provided, greater, recognition, of, iran, other, actions, thought, to, have, contributed, to, his, downfall, include, antagonising, formerly, apolitical, iranians, especially, merchants, of, the, bazaars, with, the, creation, in, 1975, of, a, single, party, political, monopoly, the, rastakhiz, party, with, compulsory, membership, and, dues, and, general, aggressive, interference, in, the, political, economic, and, religious, concerns, of, people, s, lives, and, the, 1976, change, from, an, islamic, calendar, to, an, imperial, calendar, marking, the, conquest, of, babylon, by, cyrus, as, the, first, day, instead, of, the, migration, of, muhammad, from, mecca, to, medina, this, supposed, date, was, designed, so, that, the, year, 2500, would, fall, on, 1941, the, year, when, his, own, reign, started, overnight, the, year, changed, from, 1355, to, 2535, during, the, extravagant, festivities, to, celebrate, the, 2500th, anniversary, the, shah, was, quoted, as, saying, at, cyrus, s, tomb, rest, in, peace, cyrus, for, we, are, awake, it, has, been, argued, that, the, white, revolution, was, shoddily, planned, and, haphazardly, carried, out, upsetting, the, wealthy, while, not, going, far, enough, to, provide, for, the, poor, or, offer, greater, political, freedom, in, 1974, mohammad, reza, learned, from, his, french, doctors, that, he, was, suffering, from, the, cancer, that, was, to, kill, him, six, years, later, though, this, was, such, a, carefully, guarded, secret, that, not, even, the, americans, were, aware, of, it, as, late, as, 1977, the, cia, submitted, a, report, to, president, carter, describing, the, shah, as, being, in, robust, health, the, knowledge, of, his, impending, death, left, mohammad, reza, depressed, and, passive, in, his, last, years, a, man, no, longer, capable, of, acting, some, achievements, of, the, shah, such, as, broadened, education, had, unintended, consequences, while, school, attendance, rose, by, 1966, the, school, attendance, of, urban, seven, to, fourteen, year, olds, was, estimated, at, 75, 8, iran, s, labour, market, was, slow, to, absorb, the, high, number, of, educated, youth, in, 1966, high, school, graduates, had, a, higher, rate, of, unemployment, than, did, the, illiterate, and, the, educated, unemployed, often, supported, the, revolution, during, his, second, exile, mohammad, reza, traveled, from, country, to, country, seeking, what, he, hoped, would, be, temporary, residence, first, he, flew, to, aswan, egypt, where, he, received, a, warm, and, gracious, welcome, from, president, anwar, el, sadat, he, later, lived, in, marrakesh, morocco, as, a, guest, of, king, hassan, ii, mohammad, reza, loved, to, support, royalty, during, his, time, as, shah, and, one, of, those, who, benefitted, had, been, hassan, who, received, an, interest, free, loan, of, us, 110, million, from, his, friend, mohammad, reza, expected, hassan, to, return, the, favour, but, he, soon, learned, hassan, had, other, motives, richard, parker, the, u, s, ambassador, to, morocco, reported, the, moroccans, believed, the, shah, was, worth, about, 2, billion, and, they, wanted, to, take, their, share, of, the, loot, after, leaving, morocco, mohammad, reza, lived, in, paradise, island, in, the, bahamas, and, in, cuernavaca, mexico, near, mexico, city, as, a, guest, of, jos, l, pez, portillo, richard, nixon, the, former, president, visited, the, shah, in, summer, 1979, in, mexico, a, u, s, doctor, benjamin, kean, who, examined, mohammad, reza, in, cuernavaca, later, wrote, there, was, no, longer, any, doubt, the, atmosphere, had, changed, completely, the, shah, s, appearance, was, stunningly, worse, clearly, he, had, obstructive, jaundice, the, odds, favored, gallstones, since, his, fever, chills, and, abdominal, distress, suggested, an, infection, of, the, biliary, tract, also, he, had, a, history, of, indigestion, besides, the, probable, obstruction, he, now, had, been, deeply, jaundiced, for, six, to, eight, weeks, he, was, emaciated, and, suffering, from, hard, tumor, nodes, in, the, neck, and, a, swollen, spleen, signs, that, his, cancer, was, worsening, and, he, had, severe, anemia, and, very, low, white, blood, counts, the, shah, suffered, from, gallstones, that, required, prompt, surgery, he, was, offered, treatment, in, switzerland, but, insisted, on, treatment, in, the, united, states, president, carter, did, not, wish, to, admit, mohammad, reza, to, the, u, s, but, came, under, pressure, from, henry, kissinger, who, phoned, carter, to, say, he, would, not, endorse, the, salt, ii, treaty, that, carter, had, just, signed, with, the, soviet, union, unless, the, former, shah, was, allowed, into, the, united, states, reportedly, prompting, carter, more, than, once, to, hang, up, his, phone, in, rage, in, the, oval, office, and, shout, fuck, the, shah, because, many, republicans, were, attacking, the, salt, ii, treaty, as, a, u, s, give, away, to, the, soviet, union, carter, desired, the, endorsement, of, a, republican, elder, statesman, like, kissinger, to, fend, off, this, criticism, mohammad, reza, had, decided, not, to, tell, his, mexican, doctors, he, had, cancer, and, the, mexican, doctors, had, misdiagnosed, his, illness, as, malaria, giving, him, a, regime, of, anti, malarial, drugs, that, did, nothing, to, treat, his, cancer, which, caused, his, health, to, go, into, rapid, decline, as, he, lost, 30, pounds, 14, kg, in, september, 1979, a, doctor, sent, by, david, rockefeller, reported, to, the, state, department, that, mohammad, reza, needed, to, come, to, the, united, states, for, medical, treatment, an, assessment, not, shared, by, kean, who, stated, that, the, proper, medical, equipment, for, treating, mohammad, reza, s, cancer, could, be, found, in, mexico, and, the, only, problem, was, the, former, shah, s, unwillingness, to, tell, the, mexicans, he, had, cancer, the, state, department, warned, carter, not, to, admit, the, former, shah, into, the, u, s, saying, it, was, likely, that, the, iranian, regime, would, seize, the, u, s, embassy, in, tehran, if, that, occurred, milani, suggested, there, was, a, possible, conflict, of, interest, on, the, part, of, rockefeller, noting, that, his, chase, manhattan, bank, had, given, iran, a, 500, million, loan, under, questionable, conditions, in, 1978, several, lawyers, had, refused, to, endorse, the, loan, which, placed, the, money, in, an, account, with, chase, manhattan, that, the, new, islamic, republic, had, been, making, substantial, withdrawals, from, its, account, with, chase, manhattan, and, that, rockefeller, wanted, mohammad, reza, in, the, us, knowing, full, well, it, was, likely, to, cause, the, iranians, to, storm, the, u, s, embassy, which, in, turn, would, cause, the, u, s, government, to, freeze, iranian, financial, assets, in, america, such, as, the, iranian, account, at, chase, manhattan, on, 22, october, 1979, president, jimmy, carter, reluctantly, allowed, the, shah, into, the, united, states, to, undergo, surgical, treatment, at, the, weill, cornell, medical, center, while, there, mohammad, reza, used, the, name, of, david, d, newsom, under, secretary, of, state, for, political, affairs, at, that, time, as, his, temporary, code, name, without, newsom, s, knowledge, the, shah, was, taken, later, by, u, s, air, force, jet, to, kelly, air, force, base, in, texas, and, from, there, to, wilford, hall, medical, center, at, lackland, air, force, base, it, was, anticipated, that, his, stay, in, the, united, states, would, be, short, however, surgical, complications, ensued, which, required, six, weeks, of, confinement, in, the, hospital, before, he, recovered, his, prolonged, stay, in, the, united, states, was, extremely, unpopular, with, the, revolutionary, movement, in, iran, which, still, resented, the, united, states, overthrow, of, prime, minister, mosaddegh, and, the, years, of, support, for, the, shah, s, rule, the, iranian, government, demanded, his, return, to, iran, but, he, stayed, in, the, hospital, mohammad, reza, s, time, in, new, york, was, highly, uncomfortable, he, was, under, a, heavy, security, detail, as, every, day, iranian, students, studying, in, the, united, states, gathered, outside, his, hospital, to, shout, death, to, the, shah, a, chorus, that, mohammad, reza, heard, the, former, shah, was, obsessed, with, watching, news, from, iran, and, was, greatly, upset, at, the, new, order, being, imposed, by, the, islamic, republic, mohammad, reza, could, no, longer, walk, by, this, time, and, for, security, reasons, had, to, be, moved, in, his, wheelchair, under, the, cover, of, darkness, when, he, went, to, the, hospital, while, covered, in, a, blanket, as, the, chances, of, his, assassination, were, too, great, there, are, claims, that, reza, s, admission, to, the, united, states, resulted, in, the, storming, of, the, u, s, embassy, in, tehran, and, the, kidnapping, of, u, s, diplomats, military, personnel, and, intelligence, officers, which, soon, became, known, as, the, iran, hostage, crisis, in, the, shah, s, memoir, answer, to, history, he, claimed, that, the, united, states, never, provided, him, any, kind, of, health, care, and, asked, him, to, leave, the, country, from, the, time, of, the, storming, of, the, u, s, embassy, in, tehran, and, the, taking, of, the, embassy, staff, as, hostages, mohammad, reza, s, presence, in, the, united, states, was, viewed, by, the, carter, administration, as, a, stumbling, block, to, the, release, of, the, hostages,

reza, shah, as, a, virtual, prisoner, at, the, paitilla, medical, center, a, hospital, condemned, by, the, former, shah, s, u, s, doctors, as, an, inadequate, and, poorly, staffed, hospital, and, in,

pressure, and, he, made, no, secret, of, his, dislike, of, mohammad, reza, whom, he, called, after, meeting, him, the, saddest, man, he, had, ever, met, when, he, first, met, mohammad, reza, torrijos, taunted, him, by, telling, him, it, must, be, hard, to, fall, off, the, peacock, throne, into, contadora, and, called, him, a, chupon, a, spanish, term, meaning, an, sucker, or, pacifier, that, has, all, the, juice, squeezed, out, of, it, which, is, slang, for, someone, who, is, finished, torrijos, added, to, mohammad, reza, s, misery, by, making, his, chief, bodyguard, a, militantly, marxist, sociology, professor, who, spent, much, time, lecturing, mohammad, reza, on, how, he, deserved, his, fate, because, he, had, been, a, tool, of, the, american, imperialism, that, was, ostensibly, oppressing, the, third, world, and, charged, mohammad, reza, a, monthly, rent, of, us, 21, 000, making, him, pay, for, all, his, food, and, the, wages, of, the, 200, national, guardsmen, assigned, as,

whether, the, panamanian, government, would, have, complied, is, a, matter, of, speculation, amongst, historians, in, january, 1980, the, shah, gave, his, last, television, interview, to, british, journalist, david, frost, on, contadora, island, re, broadcast, by, abc, in, the, u, s, on, 17, january, the, shah, talks, about, his, wealth, his, illness, the, savak, the, torture, during, his, reign, own, political, mistakes, khomeini, and, his, threat, of, extradition, to, iran, the, only, consolation, for, mohammad, reza, during, his, time, in, panama, were, letters, from, princess, soraya, saying, that, she, still, loved, him, and, wanted, to, see, him, one, last, time, before, he, died, mohammad, reza, in, the, letters, he, sent, to, paris, declared, he, wanted, to, see,

would, soon, die, the, tragedy, is, that, a, man, who, should, have, had, the, best, and, easiest, medical, care, had, in, many, respects, the, worst, by, that, point, it, was, arranged, by, president, sadat, that, soraya, would, quietly, visit, mohammad, reza, on, his, deathbed, in, egypt, without, farah, present, but, milani, noted, the, two, were, star, crossed, lovers, and, mohammad,

languages, however, by, the, time, of, its, publication, the, shah, had, already, died, the, book, is, his, personal, account, of, his, reign, and, accomplishments, as, well, as, his, perspective, on, issues, related, to, the, iranian, revolution, and, western, foreign, policy, toward, iran, he, places, some, of, the, blame, for, the, wrongdoings, of, savak, and, the, failures, of, various, democratic, and, social, reforms, particularly, through, the, white, revolution, upon, amir, abbas, hoveyda, and, his, administration, recently, the, shah, s, reputation, has, experienced, something, of, a, revival, in, iran, with, some, people, looking, back, on, his, era, as, a, time, when, iran, was, more, prosperous, and, the, government, less, oppressive, journalist, afshin, molavi, reported, that, some, members, of, the, uneducated, poor, traditionally, core, supporters, of, the, revolution, that, overthrew, the, shah, were, making, remarks, such, as, god, bless, the, shah, s, soul, the, economy, was, better, then, and, found, that, books, about, the, former, shah, even, censored, ones, sell, briskly, while, books, of, the, rightly, guided, path, sit, idle, on, 28, october, 2016, thousands, of, people, in, iran, celebrating, cyrus, day, at, the, tomb, of, cyrus, chanted, slogans, in, support, of, him, and, against, the, current, islamic, regime, of, iran, and, arabs, and, many, were, subsequently, arrested, from, his, mother, mohammad, reza, inherited, an, almost, messianic, belief, in, his, own, greatness, and, that, god, was, working, in, his, favour, which, explained, the, often, passive, and, fatalistic, attitudes, that, he, displayed, as, an, adult, in, 1973, mohammad, reza, told, the, italian, journalist, oriana, fallaci, a, king, who, does, not, need, to, account, to, anyone, for, what, he, says, and, does, is, unavoidably, doomed, to, loneliness, however, i, am, not, entirely, alone, because, a, force, others, can, t, perceive, accompanies, me, my, mystical, force, moreover, i, receive, messages, i, have, lived, with, god, besides, me, since, i, was, 5, years, old, since, that, is, god, sent, me, those, visions, mohammad, reza, often, spoke, in, public, and, in, private, from, childhood, onward, of, his, belief, that, god, had, chosen, him, for, a, divine, mission, to, transform, iran, as, he, believed, that, dreams, he, had, as, a, child, of, the, twelve, imams, of, shia, islam, were, all, messages, from, god, in, his, 1961, book, mission, for, my, country, mohammad, reza, wrote, from, the, time, i, was, six, or, seven, i, have, felt, that, perhaps, there, is, a, supreme, being, who, is, guiding, me, i, don, t, know, sometimes, the, thought, disturbs, me, because, then, i, ask, myself, what, is, my, own, personality, and, am, i, possessed, of, free, will, still, i, often, reflect, if, i, am, driven, or, perhaps, i, should, say, supported, by, another, force, there, must, be, a, reason, in, his, biography, of, the, shah, marvin, zonis, has, argued, that, mohammad, reza, really, believed, in, these, claims, of, divine, support, shia, islam, has, no, tradition, of, describing, shahs, being, favoured, with, messages, from, all, very, few, shahs, had, ever, claimed, that, their, dreams, were, divine, messages, and, most, people, in, the, west, laughed, at, mohammad, reza, s, claim, that, his, dreams, were, messages, from, god, reza, shah, mohammad, reza, s, father, who, was, less, religious, dismissed, these, visions, as, nonsense, and, told, his, son, to, have, more, common, sense, fereydoon, hoveyda, a, veteran, diplomat, who, served, as, the, iranian, ambassador, to, the, united, nations, 1971, 1979, and, the, brother, of, amir, abbas, hoveyda, the, prime, minister, under, the, shah, 1965, 1977, executed, after, the, islamic, revolution, and, himself, a, critic, of, the, r, gime, who, died, in, exile, says, that, when, it, comes, to, religion, and, spirituality, many, passages, of, the, monarch, s, and, khomeini, s, publications, are, interchangeable, which, he, perceives, as, the, continuity, of, the, iranian, civilization, where, the, religion, changes, but, the, spirit, remains, mohammad, reza, inherited, the, wealth, built, by, his, father, reza, shah, who, preceded, him, as, king, of, iran, and, became, known, as, the, richest, person, in, iran, during, his, reign, with, his, wealth, estimated, to, be, higher, than, 600, million, rials, and, including, vast, amounts, of, land, and, numerous, large, estates, especially, in, the, province, of, mazandaran, obtained, usually, at, a, fraction, of, their, real, price, reza, shah, facing, criticism, for, his, wealth, decided, to, pass, on, all, of, his, land, and, wealth, to, his, eldest, son, mohammad, reza, in, exchange, for, a, sugar, cube, known, in, iran, as, habbe, kardan, however, shortly, after, obtaining, the, wealth, mohammad, reza, was, ordered, by, his, father, and, then, king, to, transfer, a, million, toman, 500, 000, to, each, of, his, siblings, by, 1958, it, was, estimated, that, the, companies, possessed, by, mohammad, reza, had, a, value, of, 157, million, in, 1958, usd, with, an, estimated, additional, 100, million, saved, outside, iran, rumours, of, his, and, his, family, s, corruption, began, to, surface, which, greatly, damaged, his, reputation, this, formed, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, creation, of, the, pahlavi, foundation, and, the, distribution, of, additional, land, to, the, people, of, some, 2, 000, villages, inherited, by, his, father, often, at, very, low, and, discounted, prices, in, 1958, using, funds, from, inherited, crown, estates, mohammad, reza, established, the, pahlavi, foundation, which, functioned, as, a, tax, exempt, charity, and, held, all, his, assets, including, 830, villages, spanning, a, total, area, of, 2, 5, million, hectares, according, to, business, insider, mohammad, reza, had, set, up, the, organisation, to, pursue, iran, s, charitable, interests, in, the, u, s, at, its, height, the, organisation, was, estimated, to, be, worth, 3, billion, however, on, numerous, occasions, the, pahlavi, foundation, was, accused, of, corruption, despite, these, charges, in, his, book, answer, to, history, pahlavi, affirms, that, he, never, made, the, slightest, profit, out, of, the, foundation, in, a, 1974, interview, which, was, shown, in, a, documentary, titled, crisis, in, iran, mohammad, reza, told, mike, wallace, that, the, rumours, of, corruption, were, the, most, unjust, thing, that, i, have, heard, calling, them, a, cheap, accusation, whilst, arguing, the, allegations, were, not, as, serious, as, those, regarding, other, governments, including, that, of, the, united, states, in, november, 1978, after, pahlavi, dismissed, prime, minister, jafar, sharif, emami, and, appointed, a, military, government, he, pledged, in, a, televised, address, not, to, repeat, the, past, mistakes, and, illegalities, the, cruelty, and, corruption, despite, this, the, royal, family, s, wealth, can, be, seen, as, one, of, the, factors, behind, the, iranian, revolution, this, was, due, to, the, oil, crises, of, the, 1970s, which, increased, inflation, resulting, in, economic, austerity, measures, which, made, lower, class, workers, more, inclined, to, protest, mohammad, reza, s, wealth, remained, considerable, during, his, time, in, exile, while, staying, in, the, bahamas, he, offered, to, purchase, the, island, that, he, was, staying, on, for, 425, million, in, 1979, usd, however, his, offer, was, rejected, by, the, bahamas, which, claimed, that, the, island, was, worth, far, more, on, 17, october, 1979, again, in, exile, and, perhaps, knowing, the, gravity, of, his, illness, he, split, up, his, wealth, amongst, his, family, members, giving, 20, to, farah, 20, to, his, eldest, son, reza, 15, to, farahnaz, 15, to, leila, 20, to, his, younger, son, in, addition, to, giving, 8, to, shahnaz,
