etc, with, the, ballet, thriving, in, such, an, environment, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, saw, what, is, considered, to, be, the, golden, age, of, russian, ballet, this, era, coincided, with, an, important, change, upon, the, retirement, of, ludwig, minkus, in, 1886, the, director, ivan, vsevolozhsky, abolished, the, official, post, of, ballet, composer, in, an, effort, to, diversify, the, music, supplied, for, new, works, petipa, presented, his, colossal, grand, ballet, set, in, ancient, rome, la, vestale, in, 1888, which, was, staged, for, the, benefit, performance, of, the, visiting, italian, ballerina, elena, cornalba, the, ballet, was, set, to, the, music, of, the, composer, mikhail, ivanov, a, noted, music, critic, the, next, year, ivan, vsevolozhsky, commissioned, the, italian, riccardo, drigo, principal, conductor, of, the, imperial, ballet, italian, opera, to, compose, the, score, for, petipa, s, le, talisman, also, staged, for, cornalba, although, the, ballet, was, not, a, success, drigo, s, score, was, much, praised, by, contemporary, critics, the, director, vsevolozhsky, commissioned, the, great, composer, pyotr, illyich, tchaikovsky, to, compose, the, score, for, petipa, s, the, sleeping, beauty, which, premiered, on, 15, january, 1890, the, ballet, proved, to, be, one, of, petipa, s, masterpieces, of, choreography, the, sleeping, beauty, proved, to, be, so, popular, that, by, april, 1903, it, had, been, performed, 100, times, making, it, one, of, the, most, popular, works, in, the, imperial, ballet, s, repertory, second, only, to, petipa, s, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, petipa, was, diagnosed, with, a, severe, case, of, the, skin, disease, pemphigus, in, 1892, the, constant, pain, and, itching, brought, on, by, this, disease, caused, petipa, to, refrain, from, choreography, for, the, imperial, ballet, s, entire, 1892, 1893, theatrical, season, it, has, been, widely, accepted, by, history, that, the, responsibility, of, staging, tchaikovsky, s, second, work, for, the, imperial, ballet, the, nutcracker, fell, to, the, imperial, theatre, s, second, ballet, master, lev, ivanov, with, regard, to, who, was, ultimately, responsible, for, the, choreography, for, the, nutcracker, many, sources, contradict, one, another, some, claim, either, that, petipa, was, responsible, for, staging, the, entire, ballet, or, that, he, merely, supervised, ivanov, s, progress, the, nutcracker, premiered, 18, december, 1892, on, a, double, bill, with, tchaikovsky, s, opera, iolanta, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, many, critics, of, the, day, considered, the, work, to, not, even, be, a, ballet, at, all, with, far, too, much, emphasis, on, spectacle, something, made, all, the, more, unsuccessful, since, the, ballerina, s, role, was, reduced, to, a, grand, pas, de, deux, in, the, final, scene, the, critics, also, complained, that, ivanov, s, choreography, was, banal, with, only, a, few, passages, succeeding, simply, because, ivanov, imitated, the, choreography, of, petipa, s, dances, from, other, works, one, such, passage, mentioned, in, reviews, was, the, valse, des, flocons, de, neige, waltz, of, the, snowflakes, which, was, said, to, be, almost, identical, to, a, waltz, from, petipa, s, 1879, ballet, la, fille, des, neiges, the, daughter, of, the, snows, petipa, s, illness, kept, him, from, working, for, nearly, all, of, the, 1892, 1893, season, it, was, during, this, time, that, enrico, cecchetti, the, great, italian, dancer, and, teacher, began, to, assist, lev, ivanov, in, substituting, for, petipa, in, the, staging, of, ballets, and, rehearsals, in, 1893, petipa, supervised, cecchetti, and, ivanov, s, staging, of, the, ballet, cinderella, set, to, the, music, of, baron, boris, fitinhof, schell, the, italian, ballerina, pierina, legnani, made, her, d, but, in, the, title, role, and, on, the, evening, of, the, premiere, 15, december, 1893, her, perfection, of, technique, and, execution, caused, a, sensation, with, critics, and, balletomanes, hailing, her, as, the, supreme, ballerina, of, her, generation, in, the, last, act, she, astounded, the, audience, by, performing, a, feat, never, before, executed, by, any, ballerina, 32, fouett, s, en, tournant, petipa, was, so, enamored, with, the, stellar, ballerina, that, he, bestowed, upon, her, the, rarely, held, title, of, prima, ballerina, assoluta, and, over, the, course, of, the, next, eight, years, petipa, staged, many, new, ballets, especially, for, her, talents, petipa, returned, to, choreography, from, his, long, infirmity, with, the, one, act, le, r, veil, de, flore, the, awakening, of, flora, set, to, the, music, of, riccardo, drigo, the, ballet, had, its, premiere, on, 9,

mariinsky, theatre, for, the, occasion, lev, ivanov, mounted, the, second, scene, from, tchaikovsky, s, swan, lake, first, produced, in, moscow, in, 1877, the, gala, was, a, success, with, the, excerpt, from, swan, lake, being, the, biggest, success, on, the, program, it, was, soon, decided, that, a, revival, of, the, full, length, work, would, be, staged, for, the, 1894, 1895, season, with, ivanov, staging, the, second, and, fourth, scenes, and, petipa, staging, the, first, and, third, scenes, riccardo, drigo, would, revise, tchaikovsky, s, 1877, score, in, accordance, with, petipa, s, instructions, and, tchaikovsky, s, brother, modeste, would, revise, the, ballet, s, scenario, the, premiere, on, 27, january, 1895, with, legnani, in, the, dual, r, le, of, odette, odile, was, a, triumph, and, in, petipa, and, ivanov, s, version, swan, lake, would, go, on, to, become, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, ballets, remaining, one, of, the, ultimate, tests, for, the, classical, ballerina, and, the, corps, de, ballet, petipa, would, spend, a, great, deal, of, his, final, years, reviving, older, ballets, in, the, winter, of, 1895, petipa, presented, lavish, revivals, of, his, 1889, le, talisman, and, saint, l, on, s, 1864, the, little, humpbacked, horse, as, la, tsar, demoiselle, both, with, legnani, in, the, principal, r, les, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, saw, petipa, present, more, revivals, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, in, 1898, la, esmeralda, giselle, and, le, corsaire, in, 1899, la, bayad, re, in, 1900, and, le, roi, candaule, in, 1903, these, revivals, would, prove, to, be, petipa, s, finishing, touch, on, these, works, petipa, also, mounted, new, works, for, the, celebrations, held, at, the, moscow, imperial, bolshoi, theatre, in, honor, of, the, coronation, of, emperor, nicholas, ii, petipa, presented, the, one, act, ballet, to, drigo, s, music, le, perle, which, proved, to, be, the, greatest, success, during, the, gala, of, 29, may, 1896, le, perle, was, truly, a, ballet, grand, spectacle, based, on, the, un, staged, danced, scene, la, p, r, grina, from, verdi, s, opera, don, carlos, which, was, to, have, been, choreographed, by, petipa, s, brother, lucien, the, ballet, featured, some, of, petipa, s, most, grand, choreography, for, a, 200, member, cast, all, set, to, drigo, s, wagnerian, score, that, boasted, an, off, stage, choir, in, 1896, petipa, was, given, a, benefit, performance, to, celebrate, 50, years, in, service, to, the, st, petersburg, imperial, theatres, for, the, occasion, petipa, created, one, of, the, most, lavish, ballets, he, ever, staged, bluebeard, based, on, the, perrault, fairytale, to, the, music, of, pyotr, schenk, was, given, its, premiere, on, 20, december, 1896, the, ballet, was, given, a, sumptuous, production, many, critics, felt, that, the, ballet, was, merely, a, gargantuan, excuse, for, spectacle, and, dances, something, made, all, the, more, apparent, with, the, spectacular, showcasing, of, pierina, legnani, in, the, principal, role, of, ysaure, the, final, tableau, consisted, of, a, three, part, astrological, divertissement, titled, the, temple, of, the, past, present, future, the, temple, of, the, future, completed, the, scene, with, the, pas, de, deux, l, ctrique, performed, by, legnani, and, nikolai, legat, to, a, tremendous, ovation, from, the, audience, in, spite, of, the, criticisms, of, bluebeard, the, critics, unanimously, praised, the, seventy, eight, year, old, petipa, s, seemingly, limitless, imagination, in, the, creation, of, classical, dances, proving, once, again, that, no, other, choreographer, in, europe, could, claim, to, be, his, rival, on, 19, january, 1898, the, nearly, eighty, year, old, petipa, presented, one, of, his, greatest, ballets, raymonda, set, in, hungary, during, the, middle, ages, to, the, music, of, alexander, glazunov, which, premiered, to, great, success, petipa, s, pas, classique, hongrois, from, the, last, act, of, the, ballet, would, go, on, to, be, one, of, his, most, celebrated, and, enduring, excerpts, with, the, challenging, choreography, he, lavished, onto, legnani, who, danced, the, title, r, le, becoming, one, of, the, ultimate, tests, of, the, classical, ballerina, petipa, presented, what, would, prove, to, be, his, final, masterpiece, on, 23, february, 1900, at, the, hermitage, theatre, les, millions, d, arlequin, or, harlequinade, a, balletic, harlequinade, set, to, drigo, s, music, harlequinade, was, dedicated, by, both, drigo, and, petipa, to, the, new, empress, alexandra, feodorovna, a, work, which, would, prove, to, be, the, last, enduring, flash, of, petipa, s, choreographic, oeuvre, in, spite, of, his, vast, accomplishments, petipa, s, final, years, with, the, imperial, ballet, were, difficult, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, new, innovations, in, the, art, of, classical, dance, began, to, become, apparent, with, all, of, this, petipa, s, rocky, relationship, with, the, new, director, of, the, imperial, theatres, vladimir, telyakovsky, appointed, to, the, position, in, 1901, served, as, a, catalyst, to, the, ballet, master, s, end, telyakovsky, made, no, effort, in, disguising, his, dislike, of, petipa, s, work, as, he, felt, that, the, art, of, classical, ballet, had, become, stagnant, under, him, and, felt, that, other, choreographers, should, have, a, chance, at, the, helm, of, the, imperial, ballet, but, even, at, the, age, of, eighty, three, and, suffering, from, the, constant, pain, brought, on, by, a, severe, case, of, the, skin, disease, pemphigus, the, old, maestro, showed, no, signs, of, slowing, down, much, to, telyakovsky, s, chagrin, one, example, of, telyakovsky, s, efforts, in, his, attempt, to, de, throne, petipa, came, in, 1902, when, he, invited, alexander, gorsky, former, premier, danseur, to, the, imperial, ballet, to, stage, his, own, version, of, petipa, s, 1869, ballet, don, quixote, gorsky, had, been, engaged, as, ballet, master, to, the, ballet, of, the, moscow, imperial, bolshoi, theatre, and, in, 1900, he, mounted, a, complete, revision, of, don, quixote, in, a, version, radically, different, from, petipa, s, original, petipa, became, furious, when, he, learned, this, new, version, would, be, staged, for, the, st, peterburg, troupe, as, he, had, not, even, been, consulted, on, the, production, of, a, ballet, that, was, originally, his, creation, while, watching, a, rehearsal, of, gorsky, s, production, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, petipa, was, heard, yelling, out, will, someone, tell, that, young, man, that, i, am, not, yet, dead, petipa, was, further, frustrated, by, the, fact, that, the, imperial, theatre, s, newly, appointed, r, gisseur, nicholas, sergeyev, was, being, paid, large, sums, to, travel, throughout, the, russian, empire, and, stage, many, of, the, ageing, ballet, master, s, works, in, late, 1902, petipa, began, work, on, a, ballet, adaptation, of, the, tale, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, titled, the, magic, mirror, petipa, mounted, the, work, for, his, own, benefit, performance, which, was, to, mark, a, semi, retirement, for, the, ballet, master, the, ballet, set, to, the, music, of, the, avant, garde, composer, arsenii, koreshchenko, was, given, on, 22, february, 1903, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, to, an, audience, composed, of, the, whole, imperial, family, and, many, members, of, the, st, petersburg, nobility, the, production, boasted, bizarre, d, cor, and, costumes, that, were, considered, to, be, unsuited, for, a, classical, ballet, in, spite, of, this, petipa, received, a, roaring, ovation, from, the, audience, at, the, end, of, the, performance, le, miroir, magique, was, given, scathing, reviews, in, the, press, and, was, considered, to, be, an, all, around, failure, though, petipa, s, choreography, was, not, mentioned, among, the, criticisms, not, long, afterwards, rumour, began, to, circulate, that, petipa, was, to, be, replaced, and, telyakovsky, even, made, an, announcement, to, the, stock, trade, bulletin, a, st, petersburg, newspaper, that, the, ballet, company, will, have, to, get, used, to, a, new, balletmaster, alexander, gorsky, he, will, stage, his, own, versions, of, the, little, humpbacked, horse, and, swan, lake, he, has, staged, both, ballets, for, the, moscow, bolshoi, theatre, entirely, differently, and, in, a, much, more, original, manner, in, the, end, gorsky, never, succeeded, petipa, as, premier, ma, tre, de, ballet, the, coveted, post, would, later, go, to, mikhail, fokine, telyakovsky, knew, that, he, could, not, legally, end, petipa, s, employment, as, he, was, still, contracted, as, premier, ma, tre, de, ballet, so, he, began, a, campaign, to, drive, the, aging, ballet, master, from, the, theatre, in, 1902, telyakovsky, established, a, committee, of, influential, members, of, the, imperial, theatres, in, an, effort, to, take, away, petipa, s, powers, with, regard, to, casting, repertory, and, the, appointment, of, dancers, though, much, to, telyakovsky, s, annoyance, the, members, of, the, committee, appointed, petipa, chairman, soon, telyakovsky, began, purposely, not, sending, carriages, to, collect, petipa, for, particular, rehearsals, or, not, sending, him, lists, of, casting, for, various, ballets, and, even, not, informing, petipa, of, various, rehearsals, taking, place, information, which, the, ballet, master, was, legally, required, to, have, nevertheless, petipa, s, advanced, age, and, failing, health, left, him, with, little, energy, to, contest, the, director, petipa, was, invited, in, march, 1904, to, stage, the, pharaoh, s, daughter, at, the, paris, op, ra, the, palais, garnier, by, relatives, of, jules, henri, vernoy, de, saint, georges, who, wrote, the, ballet, s, libretto, but, his, health, prevented, him, from, it, despite, the, situation, with, telyakovsky, and, the, condition, of, his, health, petipa, still, managed, to, work, as, he, was, constantly, sought, out, by, the, dancers, of, the, imperial, ballet, for, advice, and, coaching, and, he, even, managed, to, revise, some, of, the, dances, in, his, older, works, in, 1904, petipa, coached, the, great, anna, pavlova, for, her, performances, in, giselle, and, her, d, but, in, paquita, petipa, s, diaries, reflect, the, constant, fear, of, his, aging, body, and, that, he, had, little, time, left, to, live, in, light, of, this, the, ballet, master, spent, nearly, every, minute, he, could, creating, variations, and, various, numbers, as, well, as, reworking, many, of, the, dances, in, his, older, works, in, 1903, petipa, presented, completely, new, choreography, for, many, of, the, pas, in, his, 1868, ballet, le, roi, candaule, for, this, revival, petipa, created, a, new, version, of, the, celebrated, pas, de, diane, that, would, later, be, transformed, by, agrippina, vaganova, into, the, famous, diane, and, act, on, pas, de, deux, such, work, prompted, the, ballet, master, to, write, in, his, diaries, i, am, amazing, petipa, then, set, to, work, on, what, would, prove, to, be, his, final, ballet, la, romance, d, un, bouton, de, rose, et, d, un, papillon, to, the, music, of, drigo, was, according, to, olga, preobrajenska, a, little, masterpiece, the, work, was, scheduled, to, be, presented, on, 5, february, 1904, for, a, performance, at, the, imperial, theatre, of, the, hermitage, but, the, director, telyakovsky, abruptly, cancelled, the, performance, only, two, weeks, before, the, premiere, the, official, explanation, being, the, outbreak, of, the, russo, japanese, war, for, petipa, this, was, the, final, straw, and, soon, afterwards, he, was, rarely, seen, at, the, theatre, or, at, the, imperial, ballet, school, where, rehearsals, were, held, the, minister, of, the, imperial, court, the, aristocrat, baron, fredericks, gave, petipa, the, title, ballet, master, for, life, and, granted, him, a, yearly, pension, of, 9, 000, roubles, petipa, noted, his, final, composition, on, 17, january, 1905, in, his, diaries, a, variation, to, the, music, of, cesare, pugni, for, the, prima,
