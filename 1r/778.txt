german, conductor, and, pianist, hans, von, b, low, also, described, another, of, nietzsche, s, pieces, as, the, most, undelightful, and, the, most, anti, musical, draft, on, musical, paper, that, i, have, faced, in, a, long, time, while, at, schulpforta, nietzsche, pursued, subjects, that, were, considered, unbecoming, he, became, acquainted, with, the, work, of, the, then, almost, unknown, poet, friedrich, h, lderlin, calling, him, my, favorite, poet, and, writing, an, essay, in, which, he, said, that, the, poet, raised, consciousness, to, the, most, sublime, ideality, the, teacher, who,

became, acquainted, with, ernst, ortlepp, an, eccentric, blasphemous, and, often, drunken, poet, who, was, found, dead, in, a, ditch, weeks, after, meeting, the, young, nietzsche, but, who, may, have, introduced, nietzsche, to, the, music, and, writing, of, richard, wagner, perhaps, under, ortlepp, s, influence, he, and, a, student, named, richter, returned, to, school, drunk, and, encountered, a, teacher, resulting, in, nietzsche, s, demotion, from, first, in, his, class, and, the, end, of, his, status, as, a, prefect, after, graduation, in, september, 1864, nietzsche, began, studying,

had, argued, that, historical, research, had, discredited, the, central, teachings, of, christianity, but, david, strauss, s, life, of, jesus, also, seems, to, have, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, young, man, in, addition, ludwig, feuerbach, s, the, essence, of, christianity, influenced, young, nietzsche, with, its, argument, that, people, created, god, and, not, the, other, way, around, in, june, 1865, at, the, age, of, 20, nietzsche, wrote, to, his, sister, elisabeth, who, was, deeply, religious, a, letter, regarding, his, loss, of, faith, this, letter, contains, the, following, statement, hence, the, ways, of, men, part, if, you, wish, to, strive, for, peace, of, soul, and, pleasure, then, believe, if, you, wish, to, be, a, devotee, of, truth, then, inquire, nietzsche, subsequently, concentrated, on, studying, philology, under, professor, friedrich, wilhelm, ritschl, whom, he, followed, to, the, university, of, leipzig, in, 1865, there, he, became, close, friends, with, his, fellow, student, erwin, rohde, nietzsche, s, first, philological, publications, appeared, soon, after, in, 1865, nietzsche, thoroughly, studied, the, works, of, arthur, schopenhauer, he, owed, the, awakening, of, his, philosophical, interest, to, reading, schopenhauer, s, the, world, as, will, and, representation, and, later, admitted, that, schopenhauer, was, one, of, the, few, thinkers, whom, he, respected, dedicating, the, essay, schopenhauer, as, educator, in, the, untimely, meditations, to, him, in, 1866, he, read, friedrich, albert, lange, s, history, of, materialism, lange, s, descriptions, of, kant, s, anti, materialistic, philosophy, the, rise, of, european, materialism, europe, s, increased, concern, with, science, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, and, the, general, rebellion, against, tradition, and, authority, intrigued, nietzsche, greatly, nietzsche, would, ultimately, argue, the, impossibility, of, an, evolutionary, explanation, of, the, human, aesthetic, sense, in, 1867, nietzsche, signed, up, for, one, year, of, voluntary, service, with, the, prussian, artillery, division, in, naumburg, he, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, finest, riders, among, his, fellow, recruits, and, his, officers, predicted, that, he, would, soon, reach, the, rank, of, captain, however, in, march, 1868, while, jumping, into, the, saddle, of, his, horse, nietzsche, struck, his, chest, against, the, pommel, and, tore, two, muscles, in, his, left, side, leaving, him, exhausted, and, unable, to, walk, for, months, consequently, he, turned, his, attention, to, his, studies, again, completing, them, in, 1868, nietzsche, also, met, richard, wagner, for, the, first, time, later, that, year, in, 1869, with, ritschl, s, support, nietzsche, received, an, offer, to, become, a, professor, of, classical, philology, at, the, university, of, basel, in, switzerland, he, was, only, 24, years, old, and, had, neither, completed, his, doctorate, nor, received, a, teaching, certificate, habilitation, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, by, leipzig, university, in, march, 1869, again, with, ritschl, s, support, despite, his, offer, coming, at, a, time, when, he, was, considering, giving, up, philology, for, science, he, accepted, to, this, day, nietzsche, is, still, among, the, youngest, of, the, tenured, classics, professors, on, record, nietzsche, s, 1870, projected, doctoral, thesis, contribution, toward, the, study, and, the, critique, of, the, sources, of, diogenes, laertius, beitr, ge, zur, quellenkunde, und, kritik, des, laertius, diogenes, examined, the, origins, of, the, ideas, of, diogenes, la, rtius, though, never, submitted, it, was, later, published, as, a, gratulationsschrift, congratulatory, publication, in, basel, before, moving, to, basel, nietzsche, renounced, his, prussian, citizenship, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, remained, officially, stateless, nevertheless, nietzsche, served, in, the, prussian, forces, during, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 1871, as, a, medical, orderly, in, his, short, time, in, the, military, he, experienced, much, and, witnessed, the, traumatic, effects, of, battle, he, also, contracted, diphtheria, and, dysentery, walter, kaufmann, speculates, that, he, also, contracted, syphilis, at, a, brothel, along, with, his, other, infections, at, this, time, on, returning, to, basel, in, 1870, nietzsche, observed, the, establishment, of, the, german, empire, and, otto, von, bismarck, s, subsequent, policies, as, an, outsider, and, with, a, degree, of, scepticism, regarding, their, genuineness, his, inaugural, lecture, at, the, university, was, homer, and, classical, philology, nietzsche, also, met, franz, overbeck, a, professor, of, theology, who, remained, his, friend, throughout, his, life, afrikan, spir, a, little, known, russian, philosopher, responsible, for, the, 1873, thought, and, reality, and, nietzsche, s, colleague, the, historian, jacob, burckhardt, whose, lectures, nietzsche, frequently, attended, began, to, exercise, significant, influence, on, him, nietzsche, had, already, met, richard, wagner, in, leipzig, in, 1868, and, later, wagner, s, wife, cosima, nietzsche, admired, both, greatly, and, during, his, time, at, basel, frequently, visited, wagner, s, house, in, tribschen, in, lucerne, the, wagners, brought, nietzsche, into, their, most, intimate, circle, which, included, franz, liszt, of, whom, nietzsche, colloquially, described, liszt, or, the, art, of, running, after, women, nietzsche, enjoyed, the, attention, he, gave, to, the, beginning, of, the, bayreuth, festival, in, 1870, he, gave, cosima, wagner, the, manuscript, of, the, genesis, of, the, tragic, idea, as, a, birthday, gift, in, 1872, nietzsche, published, his, first, book, the, birth, of, tragedy, however, his, colleagues, within, his, field, including, ritschl, expressed, little, enthusiasm, for, the, work, in, which, nietzsche, eschewed, the, classical, philologic, method, in, favour, of, a, more, speculative, approach, in, his, polemic, philology, of, the, future, ulrich, von, wilamowitz, moellendorff, damped, the, book, s, reception, and, increased, its, notoriety, in, response, rohde, then, a, professor, in, kiel, and, wagner, came, to, nietzsche, s, defence, nietzsche, remarked, freely, about, the, isolation, he, felt, within, the, philological, community, and, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, transfer, to, a, position, in, philosophy, at, basel, in, 1873, nietzsche, began, to, accumulate, notes, that, would, be, posthumously, published, as, philosophy, in, the, tragic, age, of, the, greeks, between, 1873, and, 1876, he, published, four, separate, long, essays, david, strauss, the, confessor, and, the, writer, on, the, use, and, abuse, of, history, for, life, schopenhauer, as, educator, and, richard, wagner, in, bayreuth, these, four, later, appeared, in, a, collected, edition, under, the, title, untimely, meditations, the, essays, shared, the, orientation, of, a, cultural, critique, challenging, the, developing, german, culture, suggested, by, schopenhauer, and, wagner, during, this, time, in, the, circle, of, the, wagners, he, met, malwida, von, meysenbug, and, hans, von, b, low, he, also, began, a, friendship, with, paul, r, e, who, in, 1876, influenced, him, into, dismissing, the, pessimism, in, his, early, writings, however, he, was, deeply, disappointed, by, the, bayreuth, festival, of, 1876, where, the, banality, of, the, shows, and, baseness, of, the, public, repelled, him, he, was, also, alienated, by, wagner, s, championing, of, german, culture, which, nietzsche, felt, a, contradiction, in, terms, as, well, as, by, wagner, s, celebration, of, his, fame, among, the, german, public, all, this, contributed, to, his, subsequent, decision, to, distance, himself, from, wagner, with, the, publication, in, 1878, of, human, all, too, human, a, book, of, aphorisms, ranging, from, metaphysics, to, morality, to, religion, a, new, style, of, nietzsche, s, work, became, clear, highly, influenced, by, afrikan, spir, s, thought, and, reality, and, reacting, against, the, pessimistic, philosophy, of, wagner, and, schopenhauer, nietzsche, s, friendship, with, deussen, and, rohde, cooled, as, well, in, 1879, after, a, significant, decline, in, health, nietzsche, had, to, resign, his, position, at, basel, and, was, pensioned, since, his, childhood, various, disruptive, illnesses, had, plagued, him, including, moments, of, shortsightedness, that, left, him, nearly, blind, migraine, headaches, and, violent, indigestion, the, 1868, riding, accident, and, diseases, in, 1870, may, have, aggravated, these, persistent, conditions, which, continued, to, affect, him, through, his, years, at, basel, forcing, him, to, take, longer, and, longer, holidays, until, regular, work, became, impractical, living, on, his, pension, from, basel, along, with, aid, from, friends, nietzsche, travelled, frequently, to, find, climates, more, conducive, to, his, health, he, lived, until, 1889, as, an, independent, author, in, different, cities, he, spent, many, summers, in, sils, maria, near, st, moritz, in, switzerland, and, many, of, his, winters, in, the, italian, cities, of, genoa, rapallo, and, turin, and, the, french, city, of, nice, in, 1881, when, france, occupied, tunisia, he, planned, to, travel, to, tunis, to, view, europe, from, the, outside, but, later, abandoned, that, idea, probably, for, health, reasons, nietzsche, occasionally, returned, to, naumburg, to, visit, his, family, and, especially, during, this, time, he, and, his, sister, elisabeth, had, repeated, periods, of, conflict, and, reconciliation, while, in, genoa, nietzsche, s, failing, eyesight, prompted, him, to, explore, the, use, of, typewriters, as, a, means, of, continuing, to, write, he, is, known, to, have, tried, using, the, hansen, writing, ball, a, contemporary, typewriter, device, in, the, end, a, past, student, of, his, peter, gast, became, a, private, secretary, to, nietzsche, in, 1876, gast, transcribed, the, crabbed, nearly, illegible, handwriting, of, nietzsche, s, first, time, with, richard, wagner, in, bayreuth, he, subsequently, transcribed, and, proofread, the, galleys, for, almost, all, of, nietzsche, s, work, on, at, least, one, occasion, on, 23, february, 1880, the, usually, poor, gast, received, 200, marks, from, their, mutual, friend, paul, r, e, gast, was, one, of, the, very, few, friends, nietzsche, allowed, to, criticise, him, in, responding, most, enthusiastically, to, also, sprach, zarathustra, thus, spoke, zarathustra, gast, did, feel, it, necessary, to, point, out, that, what, were, described, as, superfluous, people, were, in, fact, quite, necessary, he, went, on, to, list, the, number, of, people, epicurus, for, example, had, to, rely, on, to, supply, his, simple, diet, of, goat, cheese, to, the, end, of, his, life, gast, and, overbeck, remained, consistently, faithful, friends, malwida, von, meysenbug, remained, like, a, motherly, patron, even, outside, the, wagner, circle, soon, nietzsche, made, contact, with, the, music, critic, carl, fuchs, nietzsche, stood, at, the, beginning, of, his, most, productive, period, beginning, with, human, all, too, human, in, 1878, nietzsche, published, one, book, or, major, section, of, a, book, each, year, until, 1888, his, last, year, of, writing, that, year, he, completed, five, in, 1882, nietzsche, published, the, first, part, of, the, gay, science, that, year, he, also, met, lou, andreas, salom, through, malwida, von, meysenbug, and, paul, r, e, salom, s, mother, took, her, to, rome, when, salom, was, 21, at, a, literary, salon, in, the, city, salom, became, acquainted, with, paul, r, e, r, e, proposed, marriage, to, her, but, she, instead, proposed, that, they, should, live, and, study, together, as, brother, and, sister, along, with, another, man, for, company, where, they, would, establish, an, academic, commune, r, e, accepted, the, idea, and, suggested, that, they, be, joined, by, his, friend, nietzsche, the, two, met, nietzsche, in, rome, in, april, 1882, and, nietzsche, is, believed, to, have, instantly, fallen, in, love, with, salom, as, r, e, had, done, nietzsche, asked, r, e, to, propose, marriage, to, salom, which, she, rejected, she, had, been, interested, in, nietzsche, as, a, friend, but, not, as, a, husband, nietzsche, nonetheless, was, content, to, join, with, r, e, and, salom, touring, through, switzerland, and, italy, together, planning, their, commune, the, three, travelled, with, salom, s, mother, through, italy, and, considered, where, they, would, set, up, their, winterplan, commune, they, intended, to, set, up, their, commune, in, an, abandoned, monastery, but, no, suitable, location, was, found, on, 13, may, in, lucerne, when, nietzsche, was, alone, with, salom, he, earnestly, proposed, marriage, to, her, again, which, she, rejected, he, nonetheless, was, happy, to, continue, with, the, plans, for, an, academic, commune, after, discovering, the, relationship, nietzsche, s, sister, elisabeth, became, determined, to, get, nietzsche, away, from, the, immoral, woman, nietzsche, and, salom, spent, the, summer, together, in, tautenburg, in, thuringia, often, with, nietzsche, s, sister, elisabeth, as, a, chaperone, salom, reports, that, he, asked, her, to, marry, him, on, three, separate, occasions, and, that, she, refused, though, the, reliability, of, her, reports, of, events, is, questionable, arriving, in, leipzig, germany, in, october, salom, and, r, e, separated, from, nietzsche, after, a, falling, out, between, nietzsche, and, salom, in, which, salom, believed, that, nietzsche, was, desperately, in, love, with, her, while, the, three, spent, a, number, of, weeks, together, in, leipzig, in, october, 1882, the, following, month, r, e, and, salom, left, nietzsche, leaving, for, stibbe, today, zdbowo, in, poland, without, any, plans, to, meet, again, nietzsche, soon, fell, into, a, period, of, mental, anguish, although, he, continued, to, write, to, r, e, stating, we, shall, see, one, another, from, time, to, time, won, t, we, in, later, recriminations, nietzsche, would, blame, on, separate, occasions, the, failure, in, his, attempts, to, woo, salom, on, salom, r, e, and, on, the, intrigues, of, his, sister, who, had, written, letters, to, the, families, of, salom, and, r, e, to, disrupt, the, plans, for, the, commune, nietzsche, wrote, of, the, affair, in, 1883, that, he, now, felt, genuine, hatred, for, my, sister, amidst, renewed, bouts, of, illness, living, in, near, isolation, after, a, falling, out, with, his, mother, and, sister, regarding, salom, nietzsche, fled, to, rapallo, where, he, wrote, the, first, part, of, also, sprach, zarathustra, in, only, ten, days, by, 1882, nietzsche, was, taking, huge, doses, of, opium, and, continued, to, have, trouble, sleeping, in, 1883, while, staying, in, nice, he, was, writing, out, his, own, prescriptions, for, the, sedative, chloral, hydrate, signing, them, dr, nietzsche, he, turned, away, from, the, influence, of, schopenhauer, and, after, he, severed, his, social, ties, with, wagner, nietzsche, had, few, remaining, friends, now, with, the, new, style, of, zarathustra, his, work, became, even, more, alienating, and, the, market, received, it, only, to, the, degree, required, by, politeness, nietzsche, recognised, this, and, maintained, his, solitude, though, he, often, complained, his, books, remained, largely, unsold, in, 1885, he, printed, only, 40, copies, of, the, fourth, part, of, zarathustra, and, distributed, a, fraction, of, them, among, close, friends, including, helene, von, druskowitz, in, 1883, he, tried, and, failed, to, obtain, a, lecturing, post, at, the, university, of, leipzig, according, to, a, letter, he, wrote, to, peter, gast, this, was, due, to, his, attitude, towards, christianity, and, the, concept, of, god, in, 1886, nietzsche, broke, with, his, publisher, ernst, schmeitzner, disgusted, by, his, antisemitic, opinions, nietzsche, saw, his, own, writings, as, completely, buried, and, in, this, anti, semitic, dump, of, schmeitzner, associating, the, publisher, with, a, movement, that, should, be, utterly, rejected, with, cold, contempt, by, every, sensible, mind, he, then, printed, beyond, good, and, evil, at, his, own, expense, he, also, acquired, the, publication, rights, for, his, earlier, works, and, over, the, next, year, issued, second, editions, of, the, birth, of, tragedy, human, all, too, human, daybreak, and, of, the, gay, science, with, new, prefaces, placing, the, body, of, his, work, in, a, more, coherent, perspective, thereafter, he, saw, his, work, as, completed, for, a, time, and, hoped, that, soon, a, readership, would, develop, in, fact, interest, in, nietzsche, s, thought, did, increase, at, this, time, if, rather, slowly, and, imperceptibly, to, him, during, these, years, nietzsche, met, meta, von, salis, carl, spitteler, and, gottfried, keller, in, 1886, his, sister, elisabeth, married, the, antisemite, bernhard, f, rster, and, travelled, to, paraguay, to, found, nueva, germania, a, germanic, colony, through, correspondence, nietzsche, s, relationship, with, elisabeth, continued, through, cycles, of, conflict, and, reconciliation, but, they, met, again, only, after, his, collapse, he, continued, to, have, frequent, and, painful, attacks, of, illness, which, made, prolonged, work, impossible, in, 1887, nietzsche, wrote, the, polemic, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, during, the, same, year, he, encountered, the, work, of, fyodor, dostoyevsky, to, whom, he, felt, an, immediate, kinship, he, also, exchanged, letters, with, hippolyte, taine, and, georg, brandes, brandes, who, had, started, to, teach, the, philosophy, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, the, 1870s, wrote, to, nietzsche, asking, him, to, read, kierkegaard, to, which, nietzsche, replied, that, he, would, come, to, copenhagen, and, read, kierkegaard, with, him, however, before, fulfilling, this, promise, nietzsche, slipped, too, far, into, illness, at, the, beginning, of, 1888, brandes, delivered, in, copenhagen, one, of, the, first, lectures, on, nietzsche, s, philosophy, although, nietzsche, had, previously, announced, at, the, end, of, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, a, new, work, with, the, title, the, will, to, power, attempt, at, a, revaluation, of, all, values, he, seems, to, have, abandoned, this, idea, and, instead, used, some, of, the, draft, passages, to, compose, twilight, of, the, idols, and, the, antichrist, in, 1888, his, health, improved, and, he, spent, the, summer, in, high, spirits, in, the, autumn, of, 1888, his, writings, and, letters, began, to, reveal, a, higher, estimation, of, his, own, status, and, fate, he, overestimated, the, increasing, response, to, his, writings, however, especially, to, the, recent, polemic, the, case, of, wagner, on, his, 44th, birthday, after, completing, twilight, of, the, idols, and, the, antichrist, he, decided, to, write, the, autobiography, ecce, homo, in, its, preface, which, suggests, nietzsche, was, well, aware, of, the, interpretive, difficulties, his, work, would, generate, he, declares, hear, me, for, i, am, such, and, such, a, person, above, all, do, not, mistake, me, for, someone, else, in, december, nietzsche, began, a, correspondence, with, august, strindberg, and, thought, that, short, of, an, international, breakthrough, he, would, attempt, to, buy, back, his, older, writings, from, the, publisher, and, have, them, translated, into, other, european, languages, moreover, he, planned, the, publication, of, the, compilation, nietzsche, contra, wagner, and, of, the, poems, that, made, up, his, collection, dionysian, dithyrambs, on, 3, january, 1889, nietzsche, suffered, a, mental, breakdown, two, policemen, approached, him, after, he, caused, a, public, disturbance, in, the, streets, of, turin, what, happened, remains, unknown, but, an, often, repeated, tale, from, shortly, after, his, death, states, that, nietzsche, witnessed, the, flogging, of, a, horse, at, the, other, end, of, the, piazza, carlo, alberto, ran, to, the, horse, threw, his, arms, around, its, neck, to, protect, it, then, collapsed, to, the, ground, in, the, following, few, days, nietzsche, sent, short, writings, known, as, the, wahnzettel, or, wahnbriefe, literally, delusion, notes, or, letters, to, a, number, of, friends, including, cosima, wagner, and, jacob, burckhardt, most, of, them, were, signed, dionysus, though, some, were, also, signed, der, gekreuzigte, meaning, the, crucified, one, to, his, former, colleague, burckhardt, nietzsche, wrote, i, have, had, caiaphas, put, in, fetters, also, last, year, i, was, crucified, by, the, german, doctors, in, a, very, drawn, out, manner, wilhelm, bismarck, and, all, anti, semites, abolished, additionally, he, commanded, the, german, emperor, to, go, to, rome, to, be, shot, and, summoned, the, european, powers, to, take, military, action, against, germany, writing, also, that, the, pope, should, be, put, in, jail, and, that, he, nietzsche, created, the, world, and, was, in, the, process, of, having, all, anti, semites, shot, dead, on, 6, january, 1889, burckhardt, showed, the, letter, he, had, received, from, nietzsche, to, overbeck, the, following, day, overbeck, received, a, similar, letter, and, decided, that, nietzsche, s, friends, had, to, bring, him, back, to, basel, overbeck, travelled, to, turin, and, brought, nietzsche, to, a, psychiatric, clinic, in, basel, by, that, time, nietzsche, appeared, fully, in, the, grip, of, a, serious, mental, illness, and, his, mother, franziska, decided, to, transfer, him, to, a, clinic, in, jena, under, the, direction, of, otto, binswanger, in, january, 1889, they, proceeded, with, the, planned, release, of, twilight, of, the, idols, by, that, time, already, printed, and, bound, from, november, 1889, to, february, 1890, the, art, historian, julius, langbehn, attempted, to, cure, nietzsche, claiming, that, the, methods, of, the, medical, doctors, were, ineffective, in, treating, nietzsche, s, condition, langbehn, assumed, progressively, greater, control, of, nietzsche, until, his, secretiveness, discredited, him, in, march, 1890, franziska, removed, nietzsche, from, the, clinic, and, in, may, 1890, brought, him, to, her, home, in, naumburg, during, this, process, overbeck, and, gast, contemplated, what, to, do, with, nietzsche, s, unpublished, works, in, february, they, ordered, a, fifty, copy, private, edition, of, nietzsche, contra, wagner, but, the, publisher, c, g, naumann, secretly, printed, one, hundred, overbeck, and, gast, decided, to, withhold, publishing, the, antichrist, and, ecce, homo, because, of, their, more, radical, content, nietzsche, s, reception, and, recognition, enjoyed, their, first, surge, in, 1893, nietzsche, s, sister, elisabeth, returned, from, nueva, germania, in, paraguay, following, the, suicide, of, her, husband, she, studied, nietzsche, s, works, and, piece, by, piece, took, control, of, their, publication, overbeck, was, dismissed, and, gast, finally, co, operated, after, the, death, of, franziska, in, 1897, nietzsche, lived, in, weimar, where, elisabeth, cared, for, him, and, allowed, visitors, including, rudolf, steiner, who, in, 1895, had, written, friedrich, nietzsche, a, fighter, against, his, time, one, of, the, first, books, praising, nietzsche, to, meet, her, uncommunicative, brother, elisabeth, employed, steiner, as, a, tutor, to, help, her, to, understand, her, brother, s, philosophy, steiner, abandoned, the, attempt, after, only, a, few, months, declaring, that, it, was, impossible, to, teach, her, anything, about, philosophy, nietzsche, s, insanity, was, originally, diagnosed, as, tertiary, syphilis, in, accordance, with, a, prevailing, medical, paradigm, of, the, time, although, most, commentators, regard, his, breakdown, as, unrelated, to, his, philosophy, georges, bataille, dropped, dark, hints, man, incarnate, must, also, go, mad, and, ren, girard, s, postmortem, psychoanalysis, posits, a, worshipful, rivalry, with, richard, wagner, nietzsche, had, previously, written, all, superior, men, who, were, irresistibly, drawn, to, throw, off, the, yoke, of, any, kind, of, morality, and, to, frame, new, laws, had, if, they, were, not, actually, mad, no, alternative, but, to, make, themselves, or, pretend, to, be, mad, daybreak, 14, the, diagnosis, of, syphilis, has, since, been, challenged, and, a, diagnosis, of, manic, depressive, illness, with, periodic, psychosis, followed, by, vascular, dementia, was, put, forward, by, cybulska, prior, to, schain, s, study, leonard, sax, suggested, the, slow, growth, of, a, right, sided, retro, orbital, meningioma, as, an, explanation, of, nietzsche, s, dementia, orth, and, trimble, postulated, frontotemporal, dementia, while, other, researchers, have, proposed, a, hereditary, stroke, disorder, called, cadasil, poisoning, by, mercury, a, treatment, for, syphilis, at, the, time, of, nietzsche, s, death, has, also, been, suggested, in, 1898, and, 1899, nietzsche, suffered, at, least, two, strokes, they, partially, paralysed, him, leaving, him, unable, to, speak, or, walk, he, likely, suffered, from, clinical, hemiparesis, hemiplegia, on, the, left, side, of, his, body, by, 1899, after, contracting, pneumonia, in, mid, august, 1900, he, had, another, stroke, during, the, night, of, 24, 25, august, and, died, at, about, noon, on, 25, august, elisabeth, had, him, buried, beside, his, father, at, the, church, in, r, cken, near, l, tzen, his, friend, and, secretary, gast, gave, his, funeral, oration, proclaiming, holy, be, your, name, to, all, future, generations, elisabeth, f, rster, nietzsche, compiled, the, will, to, power, from, nietzsche, s, unpublished, notebooks, and, published, it, posthumously, in, 1901, because, his, sister, arranged, the, book, based, on, her, own, conflation, of, several, of, nietzsche, s, early, outlines, and, took, liberties, with, the, material, the, scholarly, consensus, has, been, that, it, does, not, reflect, nietzsche, s, intent, for, example, elisabeth, removed, aphorism, 35, of, the, antichrist, where, nietzsche, rewrote, a, passage, of, the, bible, indeed, mazzino, montinari, the, editor, of, nietzsche, s, nachlass, called, it, a, forgery, yet, the, endeavour, to, rescue, nietzsche, s, reputation, by, discrediting, the, will, to, power, often, leads, to, scepticism, about, the, value, of, his, late, notes, even, of, his, whole, nachlass, however, his, nachlass, and, the, will, to, power, are, distinct, general, commentators, and, nietzsche, scholars, whether, emphasising, his, cultural, background, or, his, language, overwhelmingly, label, nietzsche, as, a, german, philosopher, others, do, not, assign, him, a, national, category, while, germany, had, not, yet, been, unified, into, a, single, sovereign, state, nietzsche, was, born, a, citizen, of, prussia, which, was, mostly, part, of, the, german, confederation, his, birthplace, r, cken, is, in, the, modern, german, state, of, saxony, anhalt, when, he, accepted, his, post, at, basel, nietzsche, applied, for, annulment, of, his, prussian, citizenship, the, official, revocation, of, his, citizenship, came, in, a, document, dated, 17, april, 1869, and, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, remained, officially, stateless, at, least, toward, the, end, of, his, life, nietzsche, believed, his, ancestors, were, polish, he, wore, a, signet, ring, bearing, the, radwan, coat, of, arms, traceable, back, to, polish, nobility, of, medieval, times, and, the, surname, nicki, of, the, polish, noble, szlachta, family, bearing, that, coat, of, arms, gotard, nietzsche, a, member, of, the, nicki, family, left, poland, for, prussia, his, descendants, later, settled, in, the, electorate, of, saxony, circa, the, year, 1700, nietzsche, wrote, in, 1888, my, ancestors, were, polish, noblemen, nietzky, the, type, seems, to, have, been, well, preserved, despite, three, generations, of, german, mothers, at, one, point, nietzsche, became, even, more, adamant, about, his, polish, identity, i, am, a, pure, blooded, polish, nobleman, without, a, single, drop, of, bad, blood, certainly, not, german, blood, on, yet, another, occasion, nietzsche, stated, germany, is, a, great, nation, only, because, its, people, have, so, much, polish, blood, in, their, veins, i, am, proud, of, my, polish, descent, nietzsche, believed, his, name, might, have, been, germanised, in, one, letter, claiming, i, was, taught, to, ascribe, the, origin, of, my, blood, and, name, to, polish, noblemen, who, were, called, ni, tzky, and, left, their, home, and, nobleness, about, a, hundred, years, ago, finally, yielding, to, unbearable, suppression, they, were, protestants, most, scholars, dispute, nietzsche, s, account, of, his, family, s, origins, hans, von, m, ller, debunked, the, genealogy, put, forward, by, nietzsche, s, sister, in, favour, of, polish, noble, heritage, max, oehler, nietzsche, s, cousin, and, curator, of, the, nietzsche, archive, at, weimar, argued, that, all, of, nietzsche, s, ancestors, bore, german, names, including, the, wives, families, oehler, claims, that, nietzsche, came, from, a, long, line, of, german, lutheran, clergymen, on, both, sides, of, his, family, and, modern, scholars, regard, the, claim, of, nietzsche, s, polish, ancestry, as, pure, invention, colli, and, montinari, the, editors, of, nietzsche, s, assembled, letters, gloss, nietzsche, s, claims, as, a, mistaken, belief, and, without, foundation, the, name, nietzsche, itself, is, not, a, polish, name, but, an, exceptionally, common, one, throughout, central, germany, in, this, and, cognate, forms, such, as, nitsche, and, nitzke, the, name, derives, from, the, forename, nikolaus, abbreviated, to, nick, assimilated, with, the, slavic, nitz, it, first, became, nitsche, and, then, nietzsche, it, is, not, known, why, nietzsche, wanted, to, be, thought, of, as, polish, nobility, according, to, biographer, r, j, hollingdale, nietzsche, s, propagation, of, the, polish, ancestry, myth, may, have, been, part, of, his, campaign, against, germany, nicholas, d, more, states, that, nietzsche, s, claims, of, having, an, illustrious, lineage, were, a, parody, on, autobiographical, conventions, and, suspects, ecce, homo, with, its, self, laudatory, titles, such, as, why, i, am, so, wise, as, being, a, work, of, satire, he, concludes, that, nietzsche, s, supposed, polish, genealogy, was, a, joke, not, a, delusion, nietzsche, was, never, married, he, proposed, to, lou, salom, three, times, and, each, time, was, rejected, one, theory, blames, salom, s, view, on, sexuality, as, one, of, the, reasons, for, her, alienation, from, nietzsche, as, articulated, in, her, 1898, novella, fenitschka, salom, viewed, the, idea, of, sexual, intercourse, as, prohibitive, and, marriage, as, a, violation, with, some, suggesting, that, they, indicated, sexual, repression, and, neurosis, reflecting, on, unrequited, love, nietzsche, considered, that, indispensable, to, the, lover, is, his, unrequited, love, which, he, would, at, no, price, relinquish, for, a, state, of, indifference, deussen, cited, the, episode, of, cologne, s, brothel, in, february, 1865, as, instrumental, to, understanding, the, philosopher, s, way, of, thinking, mostly, about, women, nietzsche, was, surreptitiously, accompanied, to, a, call, house, from, which, he, clumsily, escaped, upon, seeing, a, half, dozen, apparitions, dressed, in, sequins, and, veils, according, to, deussen, nietzsche, never, decided, to, remain, unmarried, all, his, life, for, him, women, had, to, sacrifice, themselves, to, the, care, and, benefit, of, men, nietzsche, scholar, joachim, k, hler, has, attempted, to, explain, nietzsche, s, life, history, and, philosophy, by, claiming, that, he, was, homosexual, k, hler, argues, that, nietzsche, s, supposed, syphilis, which, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, product, of, his, encounter, with, a, prostitute, in, a, brothel, in, cologne, or, leipzig, is, equally, likely, some, maintain, that, nietzsche, contracted, it, in, a, male, brothel, in, genoa, the, acquisition, of, the, infection, from, a, homosexual, brothel, was, the, theory, believed, by, sigmund, freud, who, cited, otto, binswanger, as, his, source, k, hler, also, suggests, that, nietzsche, had, a, romantic, relationship, as, well, as, a, friendship, with, paul, r, e, there, is, the, claim, that, nietzsche, s, homosexuality, was, widely, known, in, the, vienna, psychoanalytic, society, with, nietzsche, s, friend, paul, deussen, claiming, that, he, was, a, man, who, had, never, touched, a, woman, k, hler, s, views, have, not, found, wide, acceptance, among, nietzsche, scholars, and, commentators, allan, megill, argues, that, while, k, hler, s, claim, that, nietzsche, was, conflicted, about, his, homosexual, desire, cannot, simply, be, dismissed, the, evidence, is, very, weak, and, k, hler, may, be, projecting, twentieth, century, understandings, of, sexuality, on, nineteenth, century, notions, of, friendship, it, is, also, rumoured, that, nietzsche, frequented, heterosexual, brothels, nigel, rodgers, and, mel, thompson, have, argued, that, continuous, sickness, and, headaches, hindered, nietzsche, from, engaging, much, with, women, yet, they, offer, other, examples, in, which, nietzsche, expressed, his, affections, to, women, including, wagner, s, wife, cosima, wagner, other, scholars, have, argued, that, k, hler, s, sexuality, based, interpretation, is, not, helpful, in, understanding, nietzsche, s, philosophy, however, there, are, also, those, who, stress, that, if, nietzsche, preferred, men, with, this, preference, constituting, his, psycho, sexual, make, up, but, could, not, admit, his, desires, to, himself, it, meant, he, acted, in, conflict, with, his, philosophy, because, of, nietzsche, s, evocative, style, and, provocative, ideas, his, philosophy, generates, passionate, reactions, his, works, remain, controversial, due, to, varying, interpretations, and, misinterpretations, in, western, philosophy, nietzsche, s, writings, have, been, described, as, a, case, of, free, revolutionary, thought, that, is, revolutionary, in, its, structure, and, problems, although, not, tied, to, any, revolutionary, project, his, writings, have, also, been, described, as, a, revolutionary, project, in, which, his, philosophy, serves, as, the, foundation, of, a, european, cultural, rebirth, the, apollonian, and, dionysian, is, a, two, fold, philosophical, concept, based, on, two, figures, in, ancient, greek, mythology, apollo, and, dionysus, this, relationship, takes, the, form, of, a, dialectic, even, though, the, concept, is, related, to, the, birth, of, tragedy, the, poet, h, lderlin, had, already, spoken, of, it, and, winckelmann, had, talked, of, bacchus, nietzsche, found, in, classical, athenian, tragedy, an, art, form, that, transcended, the, pessimism, found, in, the, so, called, wisdom, of, silenus, the, greek, spectators, by, looking, into, the, abyss, of, human, suffering, depicted, by, characters, on, stage, passionately, and, joyously, affirmed, life, finding, it, worth, living, the, main, theme, in, the, birth, of, tragedy, is, that, the, fusion, of, dionysian, and, apollonian, kunsttriebe, artistic, impulses, forms, dramatic, arts, or, tragedies, he, argued, that, this, fusion, has, not, been, achieved, since, the, ancient, greek, tragedians, apollo, represents, harmony, progress, clarity, logic, and, the, principle, of, individuation, whereas, dionysus, represents, disorder, intoxication, emotion, ecstasy, and, unity, hence, the, omission, of, the, principle, of, individuation, nietzsche, used, these, two, forces, because, for, him, the, world, of, mind, and, order, on, one, side, and, passion, and, chaos, on, the, other, formed, principles, that, were, fundamental, to, the, greek, culture, the, apollonian, a, dreaming, state, full, of, illusions, and, dionysian, a, state, of, intoxication, representing, the, liberations, of, instinct, and, dissolution, of, boundaries, in, this, mould, a, man, appears, as, the, satyr, he, is, the, horror, of, the, annihilation, of, the, principle, of, individuality, and, at, the, same, time, someone, who, delights, in, its, destruction, apollonian, and, dionysian, juxtapositions, appear, in, the, interplay, of, tragedy, the, tragic, hero, of, the, drama, the, main, protagonist, struggles, to, make, apollonian, order, of, his, unjust, and, chaotic, dionysian, fate, though, he, dies, unfulfilled, elaborating, on, the, conception, of, hamlet, as, an, intellectual, who, cannot, make, up, his, mind, and, is, a, living, antithesis, to, the, man, of, action, nietzsche, argues, that, a, dionysian, figure, possesses, the, knowledge, that, his, actions, cannot, change, the, eternal, balance, of, things, and, it, disgusts, him, enough, not, to, act, at, all, hamlet, falls, under, this, category, he, glimpsed, the, supernatural, reality, through, the, ghost, he, has, gained, true, knowledge, and, knows, that, no, action, of, his, has, the, power, to, change, this, for, the, audience, of, such, drama, this, tragedy, allows, them, to, sense, what, nietzsche, called, the, primordial, unity, which, revives, dionysian, nature, he, describes, primordial, unity, as, the, increase, of, strength, the, experience, of, fullness, and, plenitude, bestowed, by, frenzy, frenzy, acts, as, intoxication, and, is, crucial, for, the, physiological, condition, that, enables, the, creation, of, any, art, stimulated, by, this, state, a, person, s, artistic, will, is, enhanced, in, this, state, one, enriches, everything, out, of, one, s, own, fullness, whatever, one, sees, whatever, wills, is, seen, swelled, taut, strong, overloaded, with, strength, a, man, in, this, state, transforms, things, until, they, mirror, his, power, until, they, are, reflections, of, his, perfection, this, having, to, transform, into, perfection, is, art, nietzsche, is, adamant, that, the, works, of, aeschylus, and, sophocles, represent, the, apex, of, artistic, creation, the, true, realisation, of, tragedy, it, is, with, euripides, that, tragedy, begins, its, untergang, literally, going, under, or, downward, way, meaning, decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc, nietzsche, objects, to, euripides, use, of, socratic, rationalism, and, morality, in, his, tragedies, claiming, that, the, infusion, of, ethics, and, reason, robs, tragedy, of, its, foundation, namely, the, fragile, balance, of, the, dionysian, and, apollonian, socrates, emphasised, reason, to, such, a, degree, that, he, diffused, the, value, of, myth, and, suffering, to, human, knowledge, plato, continued, along, this, path, in, his, dialogues, and, the, modern, world, eventually, inherited, reason, at, the, expense, of, artistic, impulses, found, in, the, apollonian, and, dionysian, dichotomy, he, notes, that, without, the, apollonian, the, dionysian, lacks, the, form, and, structure, to, make, a, coherent, piece, of, art, and, without, the, dionysian, the, apollonian, lacks, the, necessary, vitality, and, passion, only, the, fertile, interplay, of, these, two, forces, brought, together, as, an, art, represented, the, best, of, greek, tragedy, an, example, of, the, impact, of, this, idea, can, be, seen, in, the, book, patterns, of, culture, where, anthropologist, ruth, benedict, acknowledges, nietzschean, opposites, of, apollonian, and, dionysian, as, the, stimulus, for, her, thoughts, about, native, american, cultures, carl, jung, has, written, extensively, on, the, dichotomy, in, psychological, types, michel, foucault, commented, that, his, own, book, madness, and, civilization, should, be, read, under, the, sun, of, the, great, nietzschean, inquiry, here, foucault, referenced, nietzsche, s, description, of, the, birth, and, death, of, tragedy, and, his, explanation, that, the, subsequent, tragedy, of, the, western, world, was, the, refusal, of, the, tragic, and, with, that, refusal, of, the, sacred, painter, mark, rothko, was, influenced, by, nietzsche, s, view, of, tragedy, presented, in, the, birth, of, tragedy, nietzsche, claimed, the, death, of, god, would, eventually, lead, to, the, realisation, that, there, can, never, be, a, universal, perspective, on, things, and, that, the, traditional, idea, of, objective, truth, is, incoherent, nietzsche, rejected, the, idea, of, objective, reality, arguing, that, knowledge, is, contingent, and, conditional, relative, to, various, fluid, perspectives, or, interests, this, leads, to, constant, reassessment, of, rules, i, e, those, of, philosophy, the, scientific, method, etc, according, to, the, circumstances, of, individual, perspectives, this, view, has, acquired, the, name, perspectivism, in, thus, spoke, zarathustra, nietzsche, proclaimed, that, a, table, of, values, hangs, above, every, great, person, he, pointed, out, that, what, is, common, among, different, peoples, is, the, act, of, esteeming, of, creating, values, even, if, the, values, are, different, from, one, person, to, the, next, nietzsche, asserted, that, what, made, people, great, was, not, the, content, of, their, beliefs, but, the, act, of, valuing, thus, the, values, a, community, strives, to, articulate, are, not, as, important, as, the, collective, will, to, see, those, values, come, to, pass, the, willingness, is, more, essential, than, the, merit, of, the, goal, itself, according, to, nietzsche, a, thousand, goals, have, there, been, so, far, says, zarathustra, for, there, are, a, thousand, peoples, only, the, yoke, for, the, thousand, necks, is, still, lacking, the, one, goal, is, lacking, humanity, still, has, no, goal, hence, the, title, of, the, aphorism, on, the, thousand, and, one, goal, the, idea, that, one, value, system, is, no, more, worthy, than, the, next, although, it, may, not, be, directly, ascribed, to, nietzsche, has, become, a, common, premise, in, modern, social, science, max, weber, and, martin, heidegger, absorbed, it, and, made, it, their, own, it, shaped, their, philosophical, and, cultural, endeavours, as, well, as, their, political, understanding, weber, for, example, relied, on, nietzsche, s, perspectivism, by, maintaining, that, objectivity, is, still, possible, but, only, after, a, particular, perspective, value, or, end, has, been, established, among, his, critique, of, traditional, philosophy, of, kant, descartes, and, plato, in, beyond, good, and, evil, nietzsche, attacked, the, thing, in, itself, and, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, as, unfalsifiable, beliefs, based, on, naive, acceptance, of, previous, notions, and, fallacies, philosopher, alasdair, macintyre, put, nietzsche, in, a, high, place, in, the, history, of, philosophy, while, criticising, nihilism, and, nietzsche, together, as, a, sign, of, general, decay, he, still, commended, him, for, recognising, psychological, motives, behind, kant, and, hume, s, moral, philosophy, for, it, was, nietzsche, s, historic, achievement, to, understand, more, clearly, than, any, other, philosopher, not, only, that, what, purported, to, be, appeals, of, objectivity, were, in, fact, expressions, of, subjective, will, but, also, the, nature, of, the, problems, that, this, posed, for, philosophy, in, beyond, good, and, evil, and, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, nietzsche, s, genealogical, account, of, the, development, of, modern, moral, systems, occupies, a, central, place, for, nietzsche, a, fundamental, shift, took, place, during, the, human, history, from, thinking, in, terms, of, good, and, bad, toward, good, and, evil, the, initial, form, of, morality, was, set, by, a, warrior, aristocracy, and, other, ruling, castes, of, ancient, civilisations, aristocratic, values, of, good, and, bad, coincided, with, and, reflected, their, relationship, to, lower, castes, such, as, slaves, nietzsche, presented, this, master, morality, as, the, original, system, of, morality, perhaps, best, associated, with, homeric, greece, to, be, good, was, to, be, happy, and, to, have, the, things, related, to, happiness, wealth, strength, health, power, etc, to, be, bad, was, to, be, like, the, slaves, over, whom, the, aristocracy, ruled, poor, weak, sick, pathetic, objects, of, pity, or, disgust, rather, than, hatred, slave, morality, developed, as, a, reaction, to, master, morality, value, emerges, from, the, contrast, between, good, and, evil, good, being, associated, with, other, worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and, submission, while, evil, is, worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and, aggressive, nietzsche, saw, slave, morality, as, pessimistic, and, fearful, its, values, emerging, to, improve, the, self, perception, of, slaves, he, associated, slave, morality, with, the, jewish, and, christian, traditions, as, it, is, born, out, of, the, ressentiment, of, slaves, nietzsche, argued, that, the, idea, of, equality, allowed, slaves, to, overcome, their, own, conditions, without, despising, themselves, by, denying, the, inherent, inequality, of, people, in, success, strength, beauty, and, intelligence, slaves, acquired, a, method, of, escape, namely, by, generating, new, values, on, the, basis, of, rejecting, master, morality, which, frustrated, them, it, was, used, to, overcome, the, slave, s, sense, of, inferiority, before, their, better, off, masters, it, does, so, by, depicting, slave, weakness, for, example, as, a, matter, of, choice, by, relabelling, it, as, meekness, the, good, man, of, master, morality, is, precisely, the, evil, man, of, slave, morality, while, the, bad, man, is, recast, as, the, good, man, nietzsche, saw, slave, morality, as, a, source, of, the, nihilism, that, has, overtaken, europe, modern, europe, and, christianity, exist, in, a, hypocritical, state, due, to, a, tension, between, master, and, slave, morality, both, contradictory, values, determining, to, varying, degrees, the, values, of, most, europeans, who, are, motley, nietzsche, called, for, exceptional, people, not, to, be, ashamed, in, the, face, of, a, supposed, morality, for, all, which, he, deems, to, be, harmful, to, the, flourishing, of, exceptional, people, he, cautioned, however, that, morality, per, se, is, not, bad, it, is, good, for, the, masses, and, should, be, left, to, them, exceptional, people, in, contrast, should, follow, their, own, inner, law, a, favourite, motto, of, nietzsche, taken, from, pindar, reads, become, what, you, are, a, long, standing, assumption, about, nietzsche, is, that, he, preferred, master, over, slave, morality, however, eminent, nietzsche, scholar, walter, kaufmann, rejected, this, interpretation, writing, that, nietzsche, s, analyses, of, these, two, types, of, morality, were, used, only, in, a, descriptive, and, historic, sense, they, were, not, meant, for, any, kind, of, acceptance, or, glorification, on, the, other, hand, nietzsche, called, master, morality, a, higher, order, of, values, the, noble, ones, those, that, say, yes, to, life, those, that, guarantee, the, future, just, as, there, is, an, order, of, rank, between, man, and, man, there, is, also, an, order, of, rank, between, morality, and, morality, nietzsche, waged, a, philosophic, war, against, the, slave, morality, of, christianity, in, his, revaluation, of, all, values, to, bring, about, the, victory, of, a, new, master, morality, that, he, called, the, philosophy, of, the, future, beyond, good, and, evil, is, subtitled, prelude, to, a, philosophy, of, the, future, in, daybreak, nietzsche, began, his, campaign, against, morality, he, called, himself, an, immoralist, and, harshly, criticised, the, prominent, moral, philosophies, of, his, day, christianity, kantianism, and, utilitarianism, nietzsche, s, concept, god, is, dead, applies, to, the, doctrines, of, christendom, though, not, to, all, other, faiths, he, claimed, that, buddhism, is, a, successful, religion, that, he, complimented, for, fostering, critical, thought, still, nietzsche, saw, his, philosophy, as, a, counter, movement, to, nihilism, through, appreciation, of, art, art, as, the, single, superior, counterforce, against, all, will, to, negation, of, life, art, as, the, anti, christian, anti, buddhist, anti, nihilist, par, excellence, nietzsche, claimed, that, the, christian, faith, as, practised, was, not, a, proper, representation, of, jesus, teachings, as, it, forced, people, merely, to, believe, in, the, way, of, jesus, but, not, to, act, as, jesus, did, in, particular, his, example, of, refusing, to, judge, people, something, that, christians, constantly, did, he, condemned, institutionalised, christianity, for, emphasising, a, morality, of, pity, mitleid, which, assumes, an, inherent, illness, in, society, christianity, is, called, the, religion, of, pity, pity, stands, opposed, to, the, tonic, emotions, which, heighten, our, vitality, it, has, a, depressing, effect, we, are, deprived, of, strength, when, we, feel, pity, that, loss, of, strength, in, which, suffering, as, such, inflicts, on, life, is, still, further, increased, and, multiplied, by, pity, pity, makes, suffering, contagious, in, ecce, homo, nietzsche, called, the, establishment, of, moral, systems, based, on, a, dichotomy, of, good, and, evil, a, calamitous, error, and, wished, to, initiate, a, re, evaluation, of, the, values, of, the, christian, world, he, indicated, his, desire, to, bring, about, a, new, more, naturalistic, source, of, value, in, the, vital, impulses, of, life, itself, while, nietzsche, attacked, the, principles, of, judaism, he, was, not, antisemitic, in, his, work, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, he, explicitly, condemned, antisemitism, and, pointed, out, that, his, attack, on, judaism, was, not, an, attack, on, contemporary, jewish, people, but, specifically, an, attack, upon, the, ancient, jewish, priesthood, who, he, claimed, antisemitic, christians, paradoxically, based, their, views, upon, an, israeli, historian, who, performed, a, statistical, analysis, of, everything, nietzsche, wrote, about, jews, claims, that, cross, references, and, context, make, clear, that, 85, of, the, negative, comments, are, attacks, on, christian, doctrine, or, sarcastically, on, richard, wagner, nietzsche, felt, that, modern, antisemitism, was, despicable, and, contrary, to, european, ideals, its, cause, in, his, opinion, was, the, growth, in, european, nationalism, and, the, endemic, jealousy, and, hatred, of, jewish, success, he, wrote, that, jews, should, be, thanked, for, helping, uphold, a, respect, for, the, philosophies, of, ancient, greece, and, for, giving, rise, to, the, noblest, human, being, christ, the, purest, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, the, mightiest, book, and, the, most, effective, moral, code, in, the, world, the, statement, god, is, dead, occurring, in, several, of, nietzsche, s, works, notably, in, the, gay, science, has, become, one, of, his, best, known, remarks, on, the, basis, of, it, many, commentators, regard, nietzsche, as, an, atheist, others, such, as, kaufmann, suggest, that, this, statement, might, reflect, a, more, subtle, understanding, of, divinity, scientific, developments, and, the, increasing, secularisation, of, europe, had, effectively, killed, the, abrahamic, god, who, had, served, as, the, basis, for, meaning, and, value, in, the, west, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, the, death, of, god, may, lead, beyond, bare, perspectivism, to, outright, nihilism, the, belief, that, nothing, has, any, inherent, importance, and, that, life, lacks, purpose, while, nietzsche, rejected, the, traditional, christian, morality, and, theology, he, also, rejected, the, nihilism, which, many, thought, was, the, only, alternative, to, it, nietzsche, believed, that, christian, moral, doctrine, was, originally, constructed, to, counteract, nihilism, it, provides, people, with, traditional, beliefs, about, the, moral, values, of, good, and, evil, belief, in, god, whose, existence, one, might, appeal, to, in, justifying, the, evil, in, the, world, and, a, framework, with, which, one, might, claim, to, have, objective, knowledge, in, constructing, a, world, where, objective, knowledge, is, supposed, to, be, possible, christianity, is, an, antidote, to, a, primal, form, of, nihilism, the, despair, of, meaninglessness, as, heidegger, put, the, problem, if, god, as, the, supra, sensory, ground, and, goal, of, all, reality, is, dead, if, the, supra, sensory, world, of, the, ideas, has, suffered, the, loss, of, its, obligatory, and, above, it, its, vitalising, and, upbuilding, power, then, nothing, more, remains, to, which, man, can, cling, and, by, which, he, can, orient, himself, one, such, reaction, to, the, loss, of, meaning, is, what, nietzsche, called, passive, nihilism, which, he, recognised, in, the, pessimistic, philosophy, of, schopenhauer, schopenhauer, s, doctrine, which, nietzsche, also, referred, to, as, western, buddhism, advocates, separating, oneself, from, will, and, desires, to, reduce, suffering, nietzsche, characterised, this, ascetic, attitude, as, a, will, to, nothingness, life, turns, away, from, itself, as, there, is, nothing, of, value, to, be, found, in, the, world, this, moving, away, of, all, value, in, the, world, is, characteristic, of, the, nihilist, although, in, this, the, nihilist, appears, to, be, inconsistent, this, will, to, nothingness, is, still, a, disavowed, form, of, willing, a, nihilist, is, a, man, who, judges, that, the, real, world, ought, not, to, be, and, that, the, world, as, it, ought, to, do, not, exist, according, to, this, view, our, existence, action, suffering, willing, feeling, has, no, meaning, this, in, vain, is, the, nihilists, pathos, an, inconsistency, on, the, part, of, the, nihilists, nietzsche, approached, the, problem, of, nihilism, as, a, deeply, personal, one, stating, that, this, problem, of, the, modern, world, had, become, conscious, in, him, furthermore, he, emphasised, the, danger, of, nihilism, and, the, possibilities, it, offers, as, seen, in, his, statement, that, i, praise, i, do, not, reproach, arrival, i, believe, it, is, one, of, the, greatest, crises, a, moment, of, the, deepest, self, reflection, of, humanity, whether, man, recovers, from, it, whether, he, becomes, a, master, of, this, crisis, is, a, question, of, his, strength, according, to, nietzsche, it, is, only, when, nihilism, is, overcome, that, a, culture, can, have, a, true, foundation, on, which, to, thrive, he, wished, to, hasten, its, coming, only, so, that, he, could, also, hasten, its, ultimate, departure, heidegger, interpreted, the, death, of, god, with, what, he, explained, as, the, death, of, metaphysics, he, concluded, that, metaphysics, has, reached, its, potential, and, that, the, ultimate, fate, and, downfall, of, metaphysics, was, proclaimed, with, the, statement, god, is, dead, scholars, such, as, nishitani, and, parkes, have, aligned, nietzsche, s, religious, thought, with, buddhist, thinkers, particularly, those, of, the, mahayana, tradition, occasionally, nietzsche, has, also, been, considered, in, relation, to, catholic, mystics, such, as, meister, eckhart, milne, has, argued, against, such, interpretations, on, the, grounds, that, such, thinkers, from, western, and, eastern, religious, traditions, strongly, emphasise, the, divestment, of, will, and, the, loss, of, ego, while, nietzsche, offers, a, robust, defence, of, egoism, milne, argues, that, nietzsche, s, religious, thought, is, better, understood, in, relation, to, his, self, professed, ancestors, heraclitus, empedocles, spinoza, goethe, milne, plays, particularly, close, attention, to, nietzsche, s, relationship, to, goethe, who, has, typically, been, neglected, in, research, by, academic, philosophers, milne, shows, that, goethe, s, views, on, the, one, and, the, many, allow, a, reciprocal, determinism, between, part, and, whole, meaning, that, a, claimed, identity, between, part, and, whole, does, not, give, the, part, value, solely, in, terms, of, belonging, to, the, whole, in, essence, this, allows, for, a, unitive, sense, of, the, individual, s, relationship, to, the, universe, while, also, fostering, a, sense, of, self, esteem, which, nietzsche, found, lacking, in, mystics, such, as, eckhart, with, regard, to, nietzsche, s, development, of, thought, it, has, been, noted, in, research, that, although, he, dealt, with, nihilistic, themes, pessimism, with, nirvana, and, with, nothingness, and, non, being, from, 1869, onwards, a, conceptual, use, of, nihilism, first, took, place, in, handwritten, notes, in, mid, 1880, this, period, saw, the, publication, of, a, then, popular, work, that, reconstructed, so, called, russian, nihilism, on, the, basis, of, russian, newspaper, reports, n, karlowitsch, the, development, of, nihilism, berlin, 1880, which, is, significant, for, nietzsche, s, terminology, a, basic, element, in, nietzsche, s, philosophical, outlook, is, the, will, to, power, der, wille, zur, macht, which, he, maintained, provides, a, basis, for, understanding, human, behaviour, more, so, than, competing, explanations, such, as, the, ones, based, on, pressure, for, adaptation, or, survival, as, such, according, to, nietzsche, the, drive, for, conservation, appears, as, the, major, motivator, of, human, or, animal, behaviour, only, in, exceptions, as, the, general, condition, of, life, is, not, one, of, a, struggle, for, existence, more, often, than, not, self, conservation, is, a, consequence, of, a, creature, s, will, to, exert, its, strength, on, the, outside, world, in, presenting, his, theory, of, human, behaviour, nietzsche, also, addressed, and, attacked, concepts, from, philosophies, then, popularly, embraced, such, as, schopenhauer, s, notion, of, an, aimless, will, or, that, of, utilitarianism, utilitarians, claim, that, what, moves, people, is, the, desire, to, be, happy, and, accumulate, pleasure, in, their, lives, but, such, a, conception, of, happiness, nietzsche, rejected, as, something, limited, to, and, characteristic, of, the, bourgeois, lifestyle, of, the, english, society, and, instead, put, forth, the, idea, that, happiness, is, not, an, aim, per, se, it, is, a, consequence, of, overcoming, hurdles, to, one, s, actions, and, the, fulfilment, of, the, will, related, to, his, theory, of, the, will, to, power, is, his, speculation, which, he, did, not, deem, final, regarding, the, reality, of, the, physical, world, including, inorganic, matter, that, like, man, s, affections, and, impulses, the, material, world, is, also, set, by, the, dynamics, of, a, form, of, the, will, to, power, at, the, core, of, his, theory, is, a, rejection, of, atomism, the, idea, that, matter, is, composed, of, stable, indivisible, units, atoms, instead, he, seemed, to, have, accepted, the, conclusions, of, ru, er, bo, kovi, who, explained, the, qualities, of, matter, as, a, result, of, an, interplay, of, forces, one, study, of, nietzsche, defines, his, fully, developed, concept, of, the, will, to, power, as, the, element, from, which, derive, both, the, quantitative, difference, of, related, forces, and, the, quality, that, devolves, into, each, force, in, this, relation, revealing, the, will, to, power, as, the, principle, of, the, synthesis, of, forces, of, such, forces, nietzsche, said, they, could, perhaps, be, viewed, as, a, primitive, form, of, the, will, likewise, he, rejected, the, view, that, the, movement, of, bodies, is, ruled, by, inexorable, laws, of, nature, positing, instead, that, movement, was, governed, by, the, power, relations, between, bodies, and, forces, other, scholars, disagree, that, nietzsche, considered, the, material, world, to, be, a, form, of, the, will, to, power, nietzsche, thoroughly, criticised, metaphysics, and, by, including, the, will, to, power, in, the, material, world, he, would, simply, be, setting, up, a, new, metaphysics, other, than, aphorism, 36, in, beyond, good, and, evil, where, he, raised, a, question, regarding, will, to, power, as, being, in, the, material, world, they, argue, it, was, only, in, his, notes, unpublished, by, himself, where, he, wrote, about, a, metaphysical, will, to, power, and, they, also, claim, that, nietzsche, directed, his, landlord, to, burn, those, notes, in, 1888, when, he, left, sils, maria, according, to, these, scholars, the, burning, story, supports, their, thesis, that, nietzsche, rejected, his, project, on, the, will, to, power, at, the, end, of, his, lucid, life, however, a, recent, study, huang, 2019, shows, that, although, it, is, true, that, in, 1888, nietzsche, wanted, some, of, his, notes, burned, this, indicates, little, about, his, project, on, the, will, to, power, not, only, because, only, 11, aphorisms, saved, from, the, flames, were, ultimately, incorporated, into, the, will, to, power, this, book, contains, 1067, aphorisms, but, also, because, these, abandoned, notes, mainly, focus, on, topics, such, as, the, critique, of, morality, while, touching, upon, the, feeling, of, power, only, once, eternal, return, also, known, as, eternal, recurrence, is, a, hypothetical, concept, that, posits, that, the, universe, has, been, recurring, and, will, continue, to, recur, for, an, infinite, number, of, times, across, infinite, time, or, space, it, is, a, purely, physical, concept, involving, no, supernatural, reincarnation, but, the, return, of, beings, in, the, same, bodies, nietzsche, first, proposed, the, idea, of, eternal, return, in, a, parable, in, section, 341, of, the, gay, science, and, also, in, the, chapter, of, the, vision, and, the, riddle, in, thus, spoke, zarathustra, among, other, places, nietzsche, considered, it, as, potentially, horrifying, and, paralyzing, and, said, that, its, burden, is, the, heaviest, weight, imaginable, das, schwerste, gewicht, the, wish, for, the, eternal, return, of, all, events, would, mark, the, ultimate, affirmation, of, life, a, reaction, to, schopenhauer, s, praise, of, denying, the, will, to, live, to, comprehend, eternal, recurrence, and, to, not, only, come, to, peace, with, it, but, to, embrace, it, requires, amor, fati, love, of, fate, as, heidegger, pointed, out, in, his, lectures, on, nietzsche, nietzsche, s, first, mention, of, eternal, recurrence, presents, this, concept, as, a, hypothetical, question, rather, than, stating, it, as, fact, according, to, heidegger, it, is, the, burden, imposed, by, the, question, of, eternal, recurrence, the, mere, possibility, of, it, and, the, reality, of, speculating, on, that, possibility, which, is, so, significant, in, modern, thought, the, way, nietzsche, here, patterns, the, first, communication, of, the, thought, of, the, greatest, burden, makes, it, clear, that, this, thought, of, thoughts, is, at, the, same, time, the, most, burdensome, thought, alexander, nehamas, writes, in, nietzsche, life, as, literature, of, three, ways, of, seeing, the, eternal, recurrence, nehamas, concluded, that, if, individuals, constitute, themselves, through, their, actions, they, can, only, maintain, themselves, in, their, current, state, by, living, in, a, recurrence, of, past, actions, nehamas, 153, nietzsche, s, thought, is, the, negation, of, the, idea, of, a, history, of, salvation, another, concept, important, to, understanding, nietzsche, is, the, bermensch, superman, writing, about, nihilism, in, also, sprach, zarathustra, nietzsche, introduced, an, bermensch, according, to, laurence, lampert, the, death, of, god, must, be, followed, by, a, long, twilight, of, piety, and, nihilism, ii, 19, iii, 8, zarathustra, s, gift, of, the, overman, is, given, to, mankind, not, aware, of, the, problem, to, which, the, overman, is, the, solution, zarathustra, presents, the, bermensch, as, the, creator, of, new, values, and, he, appears, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, the, death, of, god, and, nihilism, the, bermensch, does, not, follow, the, morality, of, common, people, since, that, favours, mediocrity, but, rises, above, the, notion, of, good, and, evil, and, above, the, herd, in, this, way, zarathustra, proclaims, his, ultimate, goal, as, the, journey, towards, the, state, of, the, bermensch, he, wants, a, kind, of, spiritual, evolution, of, self, awareness, and, overcoming, of, traditional, views, on, morality, and, justice, that, stem, from, the, superstitious, beliefs, still, deeply, rooted, or, related, to, the, notion, of, god, and, christianity, from, thus, spoke, zarathustra, zarathustra, s, prologue, pp, 9, 11, i, teach, you, the, bermensch, man, is, something, that, shall, be, overcome, what, have, you, done, to, overcome, him, all, beings, so, far, have, created, something, beyond, themselves, and, you, want, to, be, the, ebb, of, that, great, tide, and, would, rather, go, back, to, the, beast, than, overcome, man, what, is, the, ape, to, man, a, laughing, stock, or, a, painful, embarrassment, and, just, the, same, shall, man, be, to, the, bermensch, a, laughing, stock, or, a, painful, embarrassment, you, have, made, your, way, from, worm, to, man, and, much, within, you, is, still, worm, once, you, were, apes, and, even, yet, man, is, more, of, an, ape, than, any, ape, even, the, wisest, among, you, is, only, a, conflict, and, hybrid, of, plant, and, ghost, but, do, i, bid, you, become, ghosts, or, plants, behold, i, teach, you, the, bermensch, the, bermensch, is, the, meaning, of, the, earth, let, your, will, say, the, bermensch, shall, be, the, meaning, of, the, earth, man, is, a, rope, stretched, between, the, animal, and, the, bermensch, a, rope, over, an, abyss, what, is, great, in, man, is, that, he, is, a, bridge, and, not, a, goal, what, is, lovable, in, man, is, that, he, is, an, over, going, and, a, going, under, zarathustra, contrasts, the, bermensch, with, the, last, man, of, egalitarian, modernity, the, most, obvious, example, being, democracy, an, alternative, goal, humanity, might, set, for, itself, the, last, man, is, possible, only, by, mankind, s, having, bred, an, apathetic, creature, who, has, no, great, passion, or, commitment, who, is, unable, to, dream, who, merely, earns, his, living, and, keeps, warm, this, concept, appears, only, in, thus, spoke, zarathustra, and, is, presented, as, a, condition, that, would, render, the, creation, of, the, bermensch, impossible, some, have, suggested, that, the, eternal, return, is, related, to, the, bermensch, since, willing, the, eternal, return, of, the, same, is, a, necessary, step, if, the, bermensch, is, to, create, new, values, untainted, by, the, spirit, of, gravity, or, asceticism, values, involve, a, rank, ordering, of, things, and, so, are, inseparable, from, approval, and, disapproval, yet, it, was, dissatisfaction, that, prompted, men, to, seek, refuge, in, other, worldliness, and, embrace, other, worldly, values, it, could, seem, that, the, bermensch, in, being, devoted, to, any, values, at,

attempted, to, incorporate, the, concept, into, their, ideology, by, means, of, taking, nietzsche, s, figurative, form, of, speech, and, creating, a, literal, superiority, over, other, ethnicities, after, his, death, elisabeth, f, rster, nietzsche, became, the, curator, and, editor, of, her, brother, s, manuscripts, she, reworked, nietzsche, s, unpublished, writings, to, fit, her, own, german, nationalist, ideology, while, often, contradicting, or, obfuscating, nietzsche, s, stated, opinions, which, were, explicitly, opposed, to, antisemitism, and, nationalism, through, her, published, editions, nietzsche, s, work, became, associated, with, fascism, and, nazism, 20th, century, scholars, contested, this, interpretation, of, his, work, and, corrected, editions, of, his, writings, were, soon, made, available, although, nietzsche, has, been, misrepresented, as, a, predecessor, to, nazism, he, criticised, antisemitism, pan, germanism, and, to, a, lesser, extent, nationalism, thus, he, broke, with, his, editor, in, 1886, because, of, his, opposition, to, his, editor, s, antisemitic, stances, and, his, rupture, with, richard, wagner, expressed, in, the, case, of, wagner, and, nietzsche, contra, wagner, both, of, which, he, wrote, in, 1888, had, much, to, do, with, wagner, s, endorsement, of, pan, germanism, and, antisemitism, and, also, of, his, rallying, to, christianity, in, a, 29, march, 1887, letter, to, theodor, fritsch, nietzsche, mocked, antisemites, fritsch, eugen, d, hring, wagner, ebrard, wahrmund, and, the, leading, advocate, of, pan, germanism, paul, de, lagarde, who, would, become, along, with, wagner, and, houston, chamberlain, the, main, official, influences, of, nazism, this, 1887, letter, to, fritsch, ended, by, and, finally, how, do, you, think, i, feel, when, the, name, zarathustra, is, mouthed, by, anti, semites, in, contrast, to, these, examples, nietzsche, s, close, friend, franz, overbeck, recalled, in, his, memoirs, when, he, speaks, frankly, the, opinions, he, expresses, about, jews, go, in, their, severity, beyond, any, anti, semitism, the, foundation, of, his, anti, christianity, is, essentially, anti, semitic, friedrich, nietzsche, held, a, pessimistic, view, of, modern, society, and, culture, he, believed, that, the, press, and, mass, culture, led, to, conformity, and, brought, about, mediocrity, and, that, the, lack, of, intellectual, progress, was, leading, to, the, decline, of, the, human, species, in, his, opinion, some, people, would, be, able, to, become, superior, individuals, through, the, use, of, willpower, by, rising, above, mass, culture, those, persons, would, produce, higher, brighter, and, healthier, human, beings, a, trained, philologist, nietzsche, had, a, thorough, knowledge, of, greek, philosophy, he, read, kant, plato, mill, schopenhauer, and, spir, who, became, the, main, opponents, in, his, philosophy, and, later, engaged, via, the, work, of, kuno, fischer, in, particular, with, the, thought, of, baruch, spinoza, whom, he, saw, as, his, precursor, in, many, respects, but, as, a, personification, of, the, ascetic, ideal, in, others, however, nietzsche, referred, to, kant, as, a, moral, fanatic, plato, as, boring, mill, as, a, blockhead, and, of, spinoza, he, asked, how, much, of, personal, timidity, and, vulnerability, does, this, masquerade, of, a, sickly, recluse, betray, he, likewise, expressed, contempt, for, british, author, george, eliot, nietzsche, s, philosophy, while, innovative, and, revolutionary, was, indebted, to, many, predecessors, while, at, basel, nietzsche, lectured, on, pre, platonic, philosophers, for, several, years, and, the, text, of, this, lecture, series, has, been, characterised, as, a, lost, link, in, the, development, of, his, thought, in, it, concepts, such, as, the, will, to, power, the, eternal, return, of, the, same, the, overman, gay, science, self, overcoming, and, so, on, receive, rough, unnamed, formulations, and, are, linked, to, specific, pre, platonic, especially, heraclitus, who, emerges, as, a, pre, platonic, nietzsche, the, pre, socratic, thinker, heraclitus, was, known, for, rejecting, the, concept, of, being, as, a, constant, and, eternal, principle, of, the, universe, and, embracing, flux, and, incessant, change, his, symbolism, of, the, world, as, child, play, marked, by, amoral, spontaneity, and, lack, of, definite, rules, was, appreciated, by, nietzsche, due, to, his, heraclitean, sympathies, nietzsche, was, also, a, vociferous, critic, of, parmenides, who, in, contrast, to, heraclitus, viewed, the, world, as, a, single, unchanging, being, in, his, egotism, in, german, philosophy, george, santayana, claimed, that, nietzsche, s, whole, philosophy, was, a, reaction, to, schopenhauer, santayana, wrote, that, nietzsche, s, work, was, an, emendation, of, that, of, schopenhauer, the, will, to, live, would, become, the, will, to, dominate, pessimism, founded, on, reflection, would, become, optimism, founded, on, courage, the, suspense, of, the, will, in, contemplation, would, yield, to, a, more, biological, account, of, intelligence, and, taste, finally, in, the, place, of, pity, and, asceticism, schopenhauer, s, two, principles, of, morals, nietzsche, would, set, up, the, duty, of, asserting, the, will, at, all, costs, and, being, cruelly, but, beautifully, strong, these, points, of, difference, from, schopenhauer, cover, the, whole, philosophy, of, nietzsche, the, superficial, similarity, of, nietzsche, s, bermensch, to, thomas, carlyle, s, hero, as, well, as, both, authors, rhetorical, prose, style, has, led, to, speculation, concerning, the, degree, to, which, nietzsche, might, have, been, influenced, by, his, reading, of, carlyle, g, k, chesterton, believed, that, out, of, flows, most, of, the, philosophy, of, nietzsche, qualifying, his, statement, by, adding, that, they, were, profoundly, different, in, character, ruth, aproberts, has, shown, that, carlyle, anticipated, nietzsche, in, asserting, the, importance, of, metaphor, with, nietzsche, s, metaphor, fiction, theory, appear, to, owe, something, to, carlyle, announcing, the, death, of, god, and, recognising, both, goethe, s, entsagen, renunciation, and, novalis, s, selbstt, dtung, self, annihilation, as, prerequisites, for, engaging, in, philosophy, aproberts, writes, that, nietzsche, and, carlyle, had, the, same, german, sources, but, nietzsche, may, owe, more, to, carlyle, than, he, cares, to, admit, noting, that, takes, the, trouble, to, repudiate, carlyle, with, malicious, emphasis, ralph, jessop, senior, lecturer, at, the, university, of, glasgow, has, recently, argued, that, a, reassessment, of, carlyle, s, influence, on, nietzsche, is, long, overdue, nietzsche, expressed, admiration, for, 17th, century, french, moralists, such, as, la, rochefoucauld, la, bruy, re, and, vauvenargues, as, well, as, for, stendhal, the, organicism, of, paul, bourget, influenced, nietzsche, as, did, that, of, rudolf, virchow, and, alfred, espinas, in, 1867, nietzsche, wrote, in, a, letter, that, he, was, trying, to, improve, his, german, style, of, writing, with, the, help, of, lessing, lichtenberg, and, schopenhauer, it, was, probably, lichtenberg, along, with, paul, r, e, whose, aphoristic, style, of, writing, contributed, to, nietzsche, s, own, use, of, aphorism, nietzsche, early, learned, of, darwinism, through, friedrich, albert, lange, the, essays, of, ralph, waldo, emerson, had, a, profound, influence, on, nietzsche, who, loved, emerson, from, first, to, last, wrote, never, have, i, felt, so, much, at, home, in, a, book, and, called, him, author, who, has, been, richest, in, ideas, in, this, century, so, far, hippolyte, taine, influenced, nietzsche, s, view, on, rousseau, and, napoleon, notably, he, also, read, some, of, the, posthumous, works, of, charles, baudelaire, tolstoy, s, my, religion, ernest, renan, s, life, of, jesus, and, fyodor, dostoyevsky, s, demons, nietzsche, called, dostoyevsky, the, only, psychologist, from, whom, i, have, anything, to, learn, while, nietzsche, never, mentions, max, stirner, the, similarities, in, their, ideas, have, prompted, a, minority, of, interpreters, to, suggest, a, relationship, between, the, two, in, 1861, nietzsche, wrote, an, enthusiastic, essay, on, his, favorite, poet, friedrich, h, lderlin, mostly, forgotten, at, that, time, he, also, expressed, deep, appreciation, for, stifter, s, indian, summer, byron, s, manfred, and, twain, s, tom, sawyer, a, louis, jacolliot, translation, of, the, calcutta, version, of, the, ancient, hindu, text, called, the, manusmriti, was, reviewed, by, friedrich, nietzsche, he, commented, on, it, both, favourably, and, unfavorably, nietzsche, s, works, did, not, reach, a, wide, readership, during, his, active, writing, career, however, in, 1888, the, influential, danish, critic, georg, brandes, aroused, considerable, excitement, about, nietzsche, through, a, series, of, lectures, he, gave, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, in, the, years, after, nietzsche, s, death, in, 1900, his, works, became, better, known, and, readers, have, responded, to, them, in, complex, and, sometimes, controversial, ways, many, germans, eventually, discovered, his, appeals, for, greater, individualism, and, personality, development, in, thus, spoke, zarathustra, but, responded, to, them, divergently, he, had, some, following, among, left, wing, germans, in, the, 1890s, in, 1894, 1895, german, conservatives, wanted, to, ban, his, work, as, subversive, during, the, late, 19th, century, nietzsche, s, ideas, were, commonly, associated, with, anarchist, movements, and, appear, to, have, had, influence, within, them, particularly, in, france, germany, great, britain, and, the, united, states, gustav, landauer, is, credited, with, the, most, in, depth, appreciation, and, critique, of, nietzsche, s, ideas, from, an, anarchist, perspective, h, l, mencken, produced, the, first, book, on, nietzsche, in, english, in, 1907, the, philosophy, of, friedrich, nietzsche, and, in, 1910, a, book, of, translated, paragraphs, from, nietzsche, increasing, knowledge, of, his, philosophy, in, the, united, states, nietzsche, is, known, today, as, a, precursor, to, existentialism, post, structuralism, and, postmodernism, w, b, yeats, and, arthur, symons, described, nietzsche, as, the, intellectual, heir, to, william, blake, symons, went, on, to, compare, the, ideas, of, the, two, thinkers, in, the, symbolist, movement, in, literature, while, yeats, tried, to, raise, awareness, of, nietzsche, in, ireland, a, similar, notion, was, espoused, by, w, h, auden, who, wrote, of, nietzsche, in, his, new, year, letter, released, in, 1941, in, the, double, man, o, masterly, debunker, of, our, liberal, fallacies, all, your, life, you, stormed, like, your, english, forerunner, blake, nietzsche, made, an, impact, on, composers, during, the, 1890s, writer, donald, mitchell, noted, that, gustav, mahler, was, attracted, to, the, poetic, fire, of, zarathustra, but, repelled, by, the, intellectual, core, of, its, writings, he, also, quoted, mahler, himself, and, adds, that, he, was, influenced, by, nietzsche, s, conception, and, affirmative, approach, to, nature, which, mahler, presented, in, his, third, symphony, using, zarathustra, s, roundelay, frederick, delius, produced, a, piece, of, choral, music, a, mass, of, life, based, on, a, text, of, thus, spoke, zarathustra, while, richard, strauss, who, also, based, his, also, sprach, zarathustra, on, the, same, book, was, only, interested, in, finishing, another, chapter, of, symphonic, autobiography,

early, influence, on, the, poetry, of, rainer, maria, rilke, knut, hamsun, counted, nietzsche, along, with, strindberg, and, dostoyevsky, as, his, primary, influences, author, jack, london, wrote, that, he, was, more, stimulated, by, nietzsche, than, by, any, other, writer, critics, have, suggested, that, the, character, of, david, grief, in, a, son, of, the, sun, was, based, on, nietzsche,

that, nietzsche, had, exerted, great, influence, on, philosophers, and, on, people, of, literary, and, artistic, culture, but, warned, that, the, attempt, to, put, nietzsche, s, philosophy, of,
