mary, magdalene, sometimes, called, mary, of, magdala, or, simply, the, magdalene, or, the, madeleine, was, a, woman, who, according, to, the, four, canonical, gospels, traveled, with, jesus, as, one, of, his, followers, and, was, a, witness, to, his, crucifixion, and, resurrection, she, is, mentioned, by, name, twelve, times, in, the, canonical, gospels, more, than, most, of, the, apostles, and, more, than, any, other, woman, in, the, gospels, other, than, jesus, s, family, mary, s, epithet, magdalene, may, be, a, toponymic, surname, meaning, that, she, came, from, the, town, of, magdala, a, fishing, town, on, the, western, shore, of, the, sea, of, galilee, in, roman, judea, the, gospel, of, luke, chapter, 8, lists, mary, magdalene, as, one, of, the, women, who, travelled, with, jesus, and, helped, support, his, ministry, out, of, their, resources, indicating, that, she, was, probably, wealthy, the, same, passage, also, states, that, seven, demons, had, been, driven, out, of, her, a, statement, which, is, repeated, from, mark, 16, in, all, four, canonical, gospels, mary, magdalene, is, a, witness, to, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, and, in, the, synoptic, gospels, she, is, also, present, at, his, burial, all, four, gospels, identify, her, either, alone, or, as, a, member, of, a, larger, group, of, women, as, the, first, to, witness, the, empty, tomb, and, either, alone, or, as, a, member, of, a, group, as, the, first, to, witness, jesus, s, resurrection, mary, magdalene, is, considered, to, be, a, saint, by, the, catholic, eastern, orthodox, anglican, and, lutheran, denominations, in, 2016, pope, francis, raised, the, level, of, liturgical, memory, on, 22, july, from, memorial, to, feast, and, for, her, to, be, referred, to, as, the, apostle, of, the, apostles, other, protestant, churches, honor, her, as, a, heroine, of, the, faith, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, also, commemorate, her, on, the, sunday, of, the, myrrhbearers, the, orthodox, equivalent, of, one, of, the, western, three, marys, traditions, the, portrayal, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, prostitute, began, in, 591, when, pope, gregory, i, identified, mary, magdalene, who, was, introduced, in, luke, 8, 2, with, mary, of, bethany, luke, 10, 39, and, the, unnamed, sinful, woman, who, anointed, jesus, s, feet, in, luke, 7, 36, 50, pope, gregory, s, easter, sermon, resulted, in, a, widespread, belief, that, mary, magdalene, was, a, repentant, prostitute, or, promiscuous, woman, elaborate, medieval, legends, from, western, europe, then, emerged, which, told, exaggerated, tales, of, mary, magdalene, s, wealth, and, beauty, as, well, as, of, her, alleged, journey, to, southern, gaul, modern, day, france, the, identification, of, mary, magdalene, with, mary, of, bethany, and, the, unnamed, sinful, woman, was, still, a, major, controversy, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, reformation, and, some, protestant, leaders, rejected, it, during, the, counter, reformation, the, catholic, church, emphasized, mary, magdalene, as, a, symbol, of, penance, in, 1969, pope, paul, vi, removed, the, identification, of, mary, magdalene, with, mary, of, bethany, and, the, sinful, woman, from, the, general, roman, calendar, but, the, view, of, her, as, a, former, prostitute, has, persisted, in, popular, culture, because, she, was, the, first, to, witness, jesus, s, resurrection, mary, magdalene, is, known, in, some, christian, traditions, as, the, apostle, to, the, apostles, she, is, a, central, figure, in, gnostic, christian, writings, including, the, dialogue, of, the, savior, the, pistis, sophia, the, gospel, of, thomas, the, gospel, of, philip, and, the, gospel, of, mary, these, texts, portray, her, as, an, apostle, as, jesus, s, closest, and, most, beloved, disciple, and, the, only, one, who, truly, understood, his, teachings, in, the, gnostic, texts, or, gnostic, gospels, mary, s, closeness, to, jesus, results, in, tension, with, another, disciple, peter, due, to, her, gender, and, peter, s, envy, of, the, special, teachings, given, to, her, in, the, gospel, of, philip, s, text, marvin, meyer, s, translation, says, missing, text, bracketed, the, companion, of, the, is, mary, of, magdala, the, her, more, than, the, disciples, kissed, her, often, on, her, it, is, widely, accepted, among, secular, historians, that, like, jesus, mary, magdalene, was, a, real, historical, figure, nonetheless, very, little, is, known, about, her, life, unlike, paul, the, apostle, mary, magdalene, left, behind, no, known, writings, of, her, own, she, was, never, mentioned, in, any, of, the, pauline, epistles, or, in, any, of, the, general, epistles, the, earliest, and, most, reliable, sources, about, her, life, are, the, three, synoptic, gospels, of, mark, matthew, and, luke, which, were, all, written, during, the, first, century, ad, mary, magdalene, s, epithet, magdalene, literally, the, magdalene, most, likely, means, that, she, came, from, magdala, a, village, on, the, western, shore, of, the, sea, of, galilee, that, was, primarily, known, in, antiquity, as, a, fishing, town, mary, was, by, far, the, most, common, jewish, given, name, for, girls, and, women, during, the, first, century, so, it, was, necessary, for, the, authors, of, the, gospels, to, call, her, magdalene, in, order, to, distinguish, her, from, the, other, women, named, mary, who, followed, jesus, although, the, gospel, of, mark, reputed, by, scholars, to, be, the, earliest, surviving, gospel, does, not, mention, mary, magdalene, until, jesus, s, crucifixion, the, gospel, of, luke, 8, 2, 3, provides, a, brief, summary, of, her, role, during, his, ministry, soon, afterwards, he, went, on, through, cities, and, villages, proclaiming, and, bringing, the, good, news, of, the, kingdom, of, god, the, twelve, were, with, him, as, well, as, some, women, who, had, been, cured, of, evil, spirits, and, infirmities, mary, called, magdalene, from, whom, seven, demons, had, gone, out, and, joanna, the, wife, of, herod, s, steward, chuza, and, susanna, and, many, others, who, provided, for, them, out, of, their, resources, according, to, the, gospel, of, luke, jesus, exorcised, seven, demons, from, mary, magdalene, that, seven, demons, had, possessed, mary, is, repeated, in, mark, 16, 9, part, of, the, longer, ending, of, that, gospel, this, is, not, found, in, the, earliest, manuscripts, and, is, possibly, a, second, century, addition, to, the, original, text, possibly, based, on, the, gospel, of, luke, in, the, first, century, demons, were, believed, widely, to, cause, physical, and, psychological, illness, bruce, chilton, a, scholar, of, early, christianity, states, that, the, reference, to, the, number, of, demons, being, seven, may, mean, that, mary, had, to, undergo, seven, exorcisms, probably, over, a, long, period, of, time, due, to, the, first, six, being, partially, or, wholly, unsuccessful, bart, d, ehrman, a, new, testament, scholar, and, historian, of, early, christianity, contends, that, the, number, seven, may, be, merely, symbolic, since, in, jewish, tradition, seven, was, the, number, of, completion, so, that, mary, was, possessed, by, seven, demons, may, simply, mean, she, was, completely, overwhelmed, by, their, power, in, either, case, mary, must, have, suffered, from, severe, emotional, or, psychological, trauma, for, an, exorcism, of, this, kind, to, have, been, perceived, as, necessary, consequently, her, devotion, to, jesus, resulting, from, this, healing, must, have, been, very, strong, the, gospels, writers, normally, relish, giving, dramatic, descriptions, of, jesus, s, public, exorcisms, with, the, possessed, person, wailing, thrashing, and, tearing, his, or, her, clothes, in, front, of, a, crowd, by, contrast, that, mary, s, exorcism, receives, little, attention, may, indicate, that, either, jesus, performed, it, privately, or, that, the, recorders, did, not, perceive, it, as, particularly, dramatic, because, mary, is, listed, as, one, of, the, women, who, supported, jesus, s, ministry, financially, she, must, have, been, relatively, wealthy, the, places, where, she, and, the, other, women, are, mentioned, throughout, the, gospels, indicate, strongly, that, they, were, vital, to, jesus, s, ministry, and, that, mary, magdalene, always, appears, first, whenever, she, is, listed, in, the, synoptic, gospels, as, a, member, of, a, group, of, women, indicates, that, she, was, seen, as, the, most, important, out, of, all, of, them, carla, ricci, notes, that, in, lists, of, the, disciples, mary, magdalene, occupies, a, similar, position, among, jesus, s, female, followers, as, simon, peter, does, among, the, male, apostles, that, women, played, such, an, active, and, important, role, in, jesus, s, ministry, was, not, entirely, radical, or, even, unique, inscriptions, from, a, synagogue, in, aphrodisias, in, asia, minor, from, around, the, same, time, period, reveal, that, many, of, the, major, donors, to, the, synagogue, were, women, jesus, s, ministry, did, bring, women, greater, liberation, than, they, would, typically, have, held, in, mainstream, jewish, society, all, four, canonical, gospels, agree, that, several, other, women, watched, jesus, s, crucifixion, from, a, distance, with, three, explicitly, naming, mary, magdalene, as, present, mark, 15, 40, lists, the, names, of, these, women, as, mary, magdalene, mary, mother, of, james, and, salome, matthew, 27, 55, 56, lists, mary, magdalene, mary, mother, of, james, and, joseph, and, the, unnamed, mother, of, the, sons, of, zebedee, who, may, be, the, same, person, mark, calls, salome, luke, 23, 49, mentioned, a, group, of, women, watching, the, crucifixion, but, did, not, give, any, of, their, names, john, 19, 25, lists, mary, mother, of, jesus, her, sister, mary, wife, of, clopas, and, mary, magdalene, as, witnesses, to, the, crucifixion, virtually, all, reputable, historians, agree, that, jesus, was, crucified, by, the, romans, under, the, orders, of, pontius, pilate, james, dunn, states, of, baptism, and, crucifixion, that, these, two, facts, in, the, life, of, jesus, command, almost, universal, assent, nonetheless, the, gospels, accounts, of, jesus, s, crucifixion, differ, considerably, and, most, secular, historians, agree, that, some, of, the, details, in, the, accounts, have, been, altered, to, fit, their, authors, theological, agendas, ehrman, states, that, the, presence, of, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, women, at, the, cross, is, probably, historical, because, christians, would, have, been, unlikely, to, make, up, that, the, main, witnesses, to, the, crucifixion, were, women, and, also, because, their, presence, is, attested, in, both, the, synoptic, gospels, and, in, the, gospel, of, john, independently, maurice, casey, concurs, that, the, presence, of, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, women, at, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, may, be, recorded, as, an, historical, fact, according, to, e, p, sanders, the, reason, why, the, women, watched, the, crucifixion, even, after, the, male, disciples, had, fled, may, have, been, because, they, were, less, likely, to, be, arrested, they, were, braver, than, the, men, or, some, combination, thereof, all, four, canonical, gospels, as, well, as, the, apocryphal, gospel, of, peter, agree, that, jesus, s, body, was, taken, down, from, the, cross, and, buried, by, a, man, named, joseph, of, arimathea, mark, 15, 47, lists, mary, magdalene, and, mary, mother, of, joses, as, witnesses, to, the, burial, of, jesus, matthew, 27, 61, lists, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, mary, as, witnesses, luke, 23, 55, mentions, the, women, who, had, followed, him, from, galilee, but, does, not, list, any, of, their, names, john, 19, 39, 42, does, not, mention, any, women, present, during, joseph, s, burial, of, jesus, but, does, mention, the, presence, of, nicodemus, a, pharisee, with, whom, jesus, had, a, conversation, near, the, beginning, of, the, gospel, ehrman, who, previously, accepted, the, story, of, jesus, s, burial, as, historical, now, rejects, it, as, a, later, invention, on, the, basis, that, roman, governors, almost, never, allowed, for, executed, criminals, to, be, given, any, kind, of, burial, and, pontius, pilate, in, particular, was, not, the, sort, of, ruler, who, would, break, with, tradition, and, policy, when, kindly, asked, by, a, member, of, the, jewish, council, to, provide, a, decent, burial, for, a, crucified, victim, casey, argues, that, jesus, was, given, a, proper, burial, by, joseph, of, arimathea, noting, that, on, some, very, rare, occasions, roman, governors, did, release, the, bodies, of, executed, prisoners, for, burial, nonetheless, he, rejects, that, jesus, could, have, been, interred, in, an, expensive, tomb, with, a, stone, rolled, in, front, of, it, like, the, one, described, in, the, gospels, leading, him, to, conclude, that, mary, and, the, other, women, must, not, have, seen, the, tomb, sanders, affirms, jesus, s, burial, by, joseph, of, arimathea, in, the, presence, of, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, female, followers, as, completely, historical, the, earliest, description, of, jesus, s, post, resurrection, appearances, is, a, quotation, of, a, pre, pauline, creed, preserved, by, paul, the, apostle, in, 1, corinthians, 15, 3, 8, which, was, written, roughly, 20, years, before, any, of, the, gospels, this, passage, made, no, mention, of, mary, magdalene, the, other, women, or, the, story, of, the, empty, tomb, but, rather, credits, simon, peter, with, having, been, the, first, to, see, the, risen, jesus, despite, this, all, four, canonical, gospels, as, well, as, the, apocryphal, gospel, of, peter, agreed, that, mary, magdalene, either, alone, or, as, a, member, of, a, group, was, the, first, person, to, discover, that, jesus, s, tomb, was, empty, nonetheless, the, details, of, the, accounts, differ, drastically, according, to, mark, 16, 1, 8, the, earliest, account, of, the, discovery, of, the, empty, tomb, mary, magdalene, mary, the, mother, of, james, and, salome, went, to, the, tomb, just, after, sunrise, a, day, and, half, after, jesus, s, burial, and, found, that, the, stone, had, already, been, rolled, away, they, went, inside, and, saw, a, young, man, dressed, in, white, who, told, them, that, jesus, had, risen, from, the, dead, and, instructed, them, to, tell, the, male, disciples, that, he, would, meet, them, in, galilee, instead, the, women, ran, away, and, told, no, one, because, they, were, too, afraid, the, original, text, of, the, gospel, ends, here, without, the, resurrected, jesus, making, an, appearance, to, anyone, casey, argues, that, the, reason, for, this, abrupt, ending, may, be, because, the, gospel, of, mark, is, an, unfinished, first, draft, according, to, matthew, 28, 1, 10, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, mary, went, to, the, tomb, an, earthquake, occurred, and, an, angel, dressed, in, white, descended, from, heaven, and, rolled, aside, the, stone, as, the, women, were, watching, the, angel, told, them, that, jesus, had, risen, from, the, dead, then, the, risen, jesus, himself, appeared, to, the, women, as, they, were, leaving, the, tomb, and, told, them, to, tell, the, other, disciples, that, he, would, meet, them, in, galilee, according, to, luke, 24, 1, 12, mary, magdalene, joanna, and, mary, the, mother, of, james, went, to, the, tomb, and, found, the, stone, already, rolled, away, as, in, mark, they, went, inside, and, saw, two, young, men, dressed, in, white, who, told, them, that, jesus, had, risen, from, the, dead, then, they, went, and, told, the, eleven, remaining, apostles, who, dismissed, their, story, as, nonsense, in, luke, s, account, jesus, never, appears, to, the, women, but, instead, makes, his, first, appearance, to, cleopas, and, an, unnamed, disciple, on, the, road, to, emmaus, luke, s, narrative, also, removes, the, injunction, for, the, women, to, tell, the, disciples, to, return, to, galilee, and, instead, has, jesus, tell, the, disciples, not, to, return, to, galilee, but, rather, to, stay, in, the, precincts, of, jerusalem, mary, magdalene, s, role, in, the, resurrection, narrative, is, greatly, increased, in, the, account, from, the, gospel, of, john, according, to, john, 20, 1, 10, mary, magdalene, went, to, the, tomb, when, it, was, still, dark, and, saw, that, the, stone, had, already, been, rolled, away, she, did, not, see, anyone, but, immediately, ran, to, tell, peter, and, the, beloved, disciple, who, came, with, her, to, the, tomb, and, confirmed, that, it, was, empty, but, returned, home, without, seeing, the, risen, jesus, according, to, john, 20, 11, 18, mary, now, alone, in, the, garden, outside, the, tomb, saw, two, angels, sitting, where, jesus, s, body, had, been, then, the, risen, jesus, approached, her, she, at, first, mistook, him, for, the, gardener, but, after, she, heard, him, say, her, name, she, recognized, him, and, cried, out, rabbouni, which, is, aramaic, for, teacher, his, next, words, may, be, translated, as, don, t, touch, me, for, i, have, not, yet, ascended, to, my, father, or, stop, clinging, to, me, the, latter, more, probable, in, view, of, the, grammar, negated, present, imperative, stop, doing, something, already, in, progress, as, well, as, jesus, s, challenge, to, thomas, a, week, later, see, john, 20, 24, 29, jesus, then, sent, her, to, tell, the, other, apostles, the, good, news, of, his, resurrection, the, gospel, of, john, therefore, portrays, mary, magdalene, as, the, first, apostle, the, apostle, sent, to, the, apostles, because, scribes, were, unsatisfied, with, the, abrupt, ending, of, the, gospel, of, mark, they, wrote, several, different, alternative, endings, for, it, in, the, shorter, ending, which, is, found, in, very, few, manuscripts, the, women, go, to, those, around, peter, and, tell, them, what, they, had, seen, at, the, tomb, followed, by, a, brief, declaration, of, the, gospel, being, preached, from, east, to, west, this, very, forced, ending, contradicts, the, last, verse, of, the, original, gospel, stating, that, the, women, told, no, one, the, longer, ending, which, is, found, in, most, surviving, manuscripts, is, an, amalgam, of, traditions, containing, episodes, derived, from, the, other, gospels, first, it, describes, an, appearance, by, jesus, to, mary, magdalene, alone, as, in, the, gospel, of, john, followed, by, brief, descriptions, of, him, appearing, to, the, two, disciples, on, the, road, to, emmaus, as, in, the, gospel, of, luke, and, to, the, eleven, remaining, disciples, as, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, in, his, book, published, in, 2006, ehrman, states, that, it, appears, virtually, certain, that, the, stories, of, the, empty, tomb, regardless, of, whether, or, not, they, are, accurate, can, definitely, be, traced, back, to, the, historical, mary, magdalene, saying, that, in, jewish, society, women, were, regarded, as, unreliable, witnesses, and, were, forbidden, from, giving, testimony, in, court, so, early, christians, would, have, had, no, motive, to, make, up, a, story, about, a, woman, being, the, first, to, discover, the, empty, tomb, in, fact, if, they, had, made, the, story, up, they, would, have, had, strong, motivation, to, make, peter, jesus, s, closest, disciple, while, he, was, alive, the, discoverer, of, the, tomb, instead, he, also, says, that, the, story, of, mary, magdalene, discovering, the, empty, tomb, is, independently, attested, in, the, synoptics, the, gospel, of, john, and, in, the, gospel, of, peter, n, t, wright, states, that, it, is, frankly, impossible, to, imagine, that, were, inserted, into, the, tradition, after, paul, s, day, casey, challenges, this, argument, contending, that, the, women, at, the, tomb, are, not, legal, witnesses, but, rather, heroines, in, line, with, a, long, jewish, tradition, he, contends, that, the, story, of, the, empty, tomb, was, invented, by, either, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, mark, or, by, one, of, his, sources, based, on, the, historically, genuine, fact, that, the, women, really, had, been, present, at, jesus, s, crucifixion, and, burial, in, his, book, published, in, 2014, ehrman, rejects, his, own, previous, argument, stating, that, the, story, of, the, empty, tomb, can, only, be, a, later, invention, because, there, is, virtually, no, possibility, that, jesus, s, body, could, have, been, placed, in, any, kind, of, tomb, and, if, jesus, was, never, buried, then, no, one, alive, at, the, time, could, have, said, that, his, non, existent, tomb, had, been, found, empty, he, concludes, that, the, idea, that, early, christians, would, have, had, no, motive, to, make, up, the, story, simply, suffers, from, a, poverty, of, imagination, and, that, they, would, have, had, all, kinds, of, possible, motives, especially, since, women, were, overrepresented, in, early, christian, communities, and, women, themselves, would, have, had, strong, motivation, to, make, up, a, story, about, other, women, being, the, first, to, find, the, tomb, he, does, conclude, later, however, that, mary, magdalene, must, have, been, one, of, the, people, who, had, an, experience, in, which, she, thought, she, saw, the, risen, jesus, citing, her, prominence, in, the, gospel, resurrection, narratives, and, her, absence, everywhere, else, in, the, gospels, as, evidence, new, testament, apocrypha, writings, mention, mary, magdalene, some, of, these, writings, were, cited, as, scripture, by, early, christians, however, they, were, never, admitted, to, the, canon, of, the, new, testament, roman, catholic, eastern, orthodox, and, protestant, churches, generally, do, not, view, these, writings, as, part, of, the, bible, in, these, apocryphal, texts, mary, magdalene, is, portrayed, as, a, visionary, and, leader, of, the, early, movement, whom, jesus, loved, more, than, he, loved, the, other, disciples, these, texts, were, written, long, after, the, death, of, the, historical, mary, magdalene, they, are, not, regarded, by, bible, scholars, as, reliable, sources, of, information, about, her, life, sanders, summarizes, the, scholarly, consensus, that, very, very, little, in, the, apocryphal, gospels, could, conceivably, go, back, to, the, time, of, jesus, they, are, legendary, and, mythological, of, all, the, apocryphal, material, only, some, of, the, sayings, in, the, gospel, of, thomas, are, worth, consideration, nonetheless, the, texts, have, been, frequently, promoted, in, modern, works, as, though, they, were, reliable, such, works, often, support, sensationalist, statements, about, jesus, and, mary, magdalene, s, relationship, the, earliest, dialogue, between, jesus, and, mary, magdalene, is, probably, the, dialogue, of, the, saviour, a, badly, damaged, gnostic, text, discovered, in, the, nag, hammadi, library, in, 1945, the, dialogue, consists, of, a, conversation, between, jesus, mary, and, two, apostles, thomas, the, apostle, and, matthew, the, apostle, in, saying, 53, the, dialogue, attributes, to, mary, three, aphorisms, that, are, attributed, to, jesus, in, the, new, testament, the, wickedness, of, each, day, workers, deserve, their, food, disciples, resemble, their, teachers, the, narrator, commends, mary, stating, she, spoke, this, utterance, as, a, woman, who, understood, everything, the, pistis, sophia, possibly, dating, as, early, as, the, second, century, is, the, best, surviving, of, the, gnostic, writings, it, was, discovered, in, the, 18th, century, in, a, large, volume, containing, numerous, early, gnostic, treatises, the, document, takes, the, form, of, a, long, dialogue, in, which, jesus, answers, his, followers, questions, of, the, 64, questions, 39, are, presented, by, a, woman, who, is, referred, to, as, mary, or, mary, magdalene, at, one, point, jesus, says, mary, thou, blessed, one, whom, i, will, perfect, in, all, mysteries, of, those, of, the, height, discourse, in, openness, thou, whose, heart, is, raised, to, the, kingdom, of, heaven, more, than, all, thy, brethren, at, another, point, he, tells, her, well, done, mary, you, are, more, blessed, than, all, women, on, earth, because, you, will, be, the, fullness, of, fullness, and, the, completion, of, completion, simon, peter, annoyed, at, mary, s, dominance, of, the, conversation, tells, jesus, my, master, we, cannot, endure, this, woman, who, gets, in, our, way, and, does, not, let, any, of, us, speak, though, she, talks, all, the, time, mary, defends, herself, saying, my, master, i, understand, in, my, mind, that, i, can, come, forward, at, any, time, to, interpret, what, pistis, sophia, has, said, but, i, am, afraid, of, peter, because, he, threatens, me, and, hates, our, gender, jesus, assures, her, any, of, those, filled, with, the, spirit, of, light, will, come, forward, to, interpret, what, i, say, no, one, will, be, able, to, oppose, them, the, gospel, of, thomas, usually, dated, to, the, late, first, or, early, second, century, was, among, the, ancient, texts, discovered, in, the, nag, hammadi, library, in, 1945, the, gospel, of, thomas, consists, entirely, of, 114, sayings, attributed, to, jesus, many, of, these, sayings, are, similar, to, ones, in, the, canonical, gospels, but, others, are, completely, unlike, anything, found, in, the, new, testament, some, scholars, believe, that, at, least, a, few, of, these, sayings, may, authentically, be, traced, back, to, the, historical, jesus, two, of, the, sayings, reference, a, woman, named, mary, who, is, generally, regarded, as, mary, magdalene, in, saying, 21, mary, herself, asks, jesus, whom, are, your, disciples, like, jesus, responds, they, are, like, children, who, have, settled, in, a, field, which, is, not, theirs, when, the, owners, of, the, field, come, they, will, say, let, us, have, back, our, field, they, will, undress, in, their, presence, in, order, to, let, them, have, back, their, field, and, to, give, it, back, to, them, following, this, jesus, continues, his, explanation, with, a, parable, about, the, owner, of, a, house, and, a, thief, ending, with, the, common, rhetoric, whoever, has, ears, to, hear, let, him, hear, mary, s, mention, in, saying, 114, however, has, generated, considerable, controversy, simon, peter, said, to, them, let, mary, go, forth, from, among, us, for, women, are, not, worthy, of, the, life, jesus, said, behold, i, shall, lead, her, that, i, may, make, her, male, in, order, that, she, also, may, become, a, living, spirit, like, you, males, for, every, woman, who, makes, herself, male, shall, enter, into, the, kingdom, of, heaven, in, the, ancient, world, it, was, almost, universally, believed, that, women, were, inferior, to, men, and, that, they, were, in, essence, imperfect, men, who, had, not, fully, developed, when, peter, challenges, mary, s, authority, in, this, saying, he, does, so, on, the, widely, accepted, premise, that, she, is, a, woman, and, therefore, an, inferior, human, being, when, jesus, rebukes, him, for, this, he, bases, his, response, on, the, same, premise, stating, that, mary, and, all, faithful, women, like, her, will, become, men, and, that, salvation, is, therefore, open, to, all, even, those, who, are, presently, women, the, gospel, of, philip, dating, from, the, second, or, third, century, survives, in, part, among, the, texts, found, in, nag, hammadi, in, 1945, in, a, manner, very, similar, to, john, 19, 25, 26, the, gospel, of, philip, presents, mary, magdalene, among, jesus, s, female, entourage, adding, that, she, was, his, koin, nos, a, greek, word, variously, translated, in, contemporary, versions, as, partner, associate, comrade, companion, there, were, three, who, always, walked, with, the, lord, mary, his, mother, and, her, sister, and, magdalene, who, was, called, his, companion, his, sister, his, mother, and, his, companion, were, each, a, mary, the, gospel, of, philip, uses, cognates, of, koin, nos, and, coptic, equivalents, to, refer, to, the, literal, pairing, of, men, and, women, in, marriage, and, sexual, intercourse, but, also, metaphorically, referring, to, a, spiritual, partnership, and, the, reunification, of, the, gnostic, christian, with, the, divine, realm, the, gospel, of, philip, also, contains, another, passage, relating, to, jesus, s, relationship, with, mary, magdalene, the, text, is, badly, fragmented, and, speculated, but, unreliable, additions, are, shown, in, brackets, and, the, companion, of, the, mary, magdalene, loved, mary, more, than, the, disciples, kiss, her, on, the, the, rest, of, the, disciples, they, said, to, him, why, do, you, love, her, more, than, all, of, us, the, saviour, answered, and, said, to, them, why, do, i, not, love, you, like, her, when, a, blind, man, and, one, who, sees, are, both, together, in, darkness, they, are, no, different, from, one, another, when, the, light, comes, then, he, who, sees, will, see, the, light, and, he, who, is, blind, will, remain, in, darkness, for, early, christians, kissing, did, not, have, a, romantic, connotation, and, it, was, common, for, christians, to, kiss, their, fellow, believers, as, a, way, of, greeting, this, tradition, is, still, practiced, in, many, christian, congregations, today, and, is, known, as, the, kiss, of, peace, ehrman, explains, that, in, the, context, of, the, gospel, of, philip, the, kiss, of, peace, is, used, as, a, symbol, for, the, passage, of, truth, from, one, person, to, another, and, that, it, is, not, in, any, way, an, act, of, divine, foreplay, the, gospel, of, mary, is, the, only, surviving, apocryphal, text, named, after, a, woman, it, contains, information, about, the, role, of, women, in, the, early, church, the, text, was, probably, written, over, a, century, after, the, historical, mary, magdalene, s, death, the, text, is, not, attributed, to, her, and, its, author, is, anonymous, instead, it, received, its, title, because, it, is, about, her, the, main, surviving, text, comes, from, a, coptic, translation, preserved, in, a, fifth, century, manuscript, berolinensis, gnosticus, 8052, 1, discovered, in, cairo, in, 1896, as, a, result, of, numerous, intervening, conflicts, the, manuscript, was, not, published, until, 1955, roughly, half, the, text, of, the, gospel, in, this, manuscript, has, been, lost, the, first, six, pages, and, four, from, the, middle, are, missing, in, addition, to, this, coptic, translation, two, brief, third, century, fragments, of, the, gospel, in, the, original, greek, p, rylands, 463, and, p, oxyrhynchus, 3525, have, also, been, discovered, which, were, published, in, 1938, and, 1983, respectively, the, first, part, of, the, gospel, deals, with, jesus, s, parting, words, to, his, followers, after, a, post, resurrection, appearance, mary, first, appears, in, the, second, part, in, which, she, tells, the, other, disciples, who, are, all, in, fright, for, their, own, lives, do, not, weep, or, grieve, or, be, in, doubt, for, his, grace, will, be, with, you, all, and, will, protect, you, rather, let, us, praise, his, greatness, for, he, has, prepared, us, and, made, us, truly, human, unlike, in, the, gospel, of, thomas, where, women, can, only, be, saved, by, becoming, men, in, the, gospel, of, mary, they, can, be, saved, just, as, they, are, peter, approaches, mary, and, asks, her, sister, we, know, that, the, saviour, loved, you, more, than, the, rest, of, woman, tell, us, the, words, of, the, saviour, which, you, remember, which, you, know, but, we, do, not, nor, have, we, heard, them, mary, answered, and, said, what, is, hidden, from, you, i, will, proclaim, to, you, and, she, began, to, speak, to, them, these, words, i, she, said, i, saw, the, lord, in, a, vision, and, i, said, to, him, lord, i, saw, you, today, in, a, vision, mary, then, proceeds, to, describe, the, gnostic, cosmology, in, depth, revealing, that, she, is, the, only, one, who, has, understood, jesus, s, true, teachings, andrew, the, apostle, challenges, mary, insisting, say, what, you, think, about, what, she, said, but, i, do, not, believe, the, savior, said, this, these, teachings, are, strange, ideas, peter, responds, saying, did, he, really, speak, with, a, woman, in, private, without, our, knowledge, should, we, all, listen, to, her, did, he, prefer, her, to, us, andrew, and, peter, s, responses, are, intended, to, demonstrate, that, they, do, not, understand, jesus, s, teachings, and, that, it, is, really, only, mary, who, truly, understands, matthew, the, apostle, comes, to, mary, s, defense, giving, a, sharp, rebuke, to, peter, peter, you, are, always, angry, now, i, see, you, arguing, against, this, woman, like, an, adversary, if, the, savior, made, her, worthy, who, are, you, to, reject, her, surely, the, savior, knows, her, well, that, is, why, he, loved, her, more, than, us, the, borborites, also, known, as, the, phibionites, were, an, early, christian, gnostic, sect, during, the, late, fourth, century, who, had, numerous, scriptures, involving, mary, magdalene, including, the, questions, of, mary, the, greater, questions, of, mary, the, lesser, questions, of, mary, and, the, birth, of, mary, none, of, these, texts, have, survived, to, the, present, but, they, are, mentioned, by, the, early, christian, heretic, hunter, epiphanius, of, salamis, in, his, panarion, epiphanius, says, that, the, greater, questions, of, mary, contained, an, episode, in, which, during, a, post, resurrection, appearance, jesus, took, mary, to, the, top, of, a, mountain, where, he, pulled, a, woman, out, of, his, side, and, engaged, in, sexual, intercourse, with, her, then, upon, ejaculating, jesus, drank, his, own, semen, and, told, mary, thus, we, must, do, that, we, may, live, upon, hearing, this, mary, instantly, fainted, to, which, jesus, responded, by, helping, her, up, and, telling, her, o, thou, of, little, faith, wherefore, didst, thou, doubt, this, story, was, supposedly, the, basis, for, the, borborite, eucharist, ritual, in, which, they, allegedly, engaged, in, orgies, and, drank, semen, and, menstrual, blood, as, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, respectively, ehrman, casts, doubt, on, the, accuracy, of, epiphanius, s, summary, commenting, that, the, details, of, epiphanius, s, description, sound, very, much, like, what, you, can, find, in, the, ancient, rumor, mill, about, secret, societies, in, the, ancient, world, most, of, the, earliest, church, fathers, do, not, mention, mary, magdalene, and, those, who, do, mention, her, usually, only, discuss, her, very, briefly, in, his, anti, christian, polemic, the, true, word, written, between, 170, and, 180, the, pagan, philosopher, celsus, declared, that, mary, magdalene, was, nothing, more, than, a, hysterical, female, who, either, dreamt, in, a, certain, state, of, mind, and, through, wishful, thinking, had, a, hallucination, due, to, some, mistaken, notion, an, experience, which, has, happened, to, thousands, or, which, is, more, likely, wanted, to, impress, others, by, telling, this, fantastic, tale, and, so, by, this, cock, and, bull, story, to, provide, a, chance, for, other, beggars, the, church, father, origen, c, 184, c, 253, defended, christianity, against, this, accusation, in, his, apologetic, treatise, against, celsus, mentioning, matthew, 28, 1, which, lists, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, mary, both, seeing, the, resurrected, jesus, thus, providing, a, second, witness, origen, also, preserves, a, statement, from, celsus, that, some, christians, in, his, day, followed, the, teachings, of, a, woman, named, mariamme, who, is, almost, certainly, mary, magdalene, origen, merely, dismisses, this, remarking, that, celsus, pours, on, us, a, heap, of, names, mary, magdalene, has, the, reputation, in, western, christianity, as, being, a, repentant, prostitute, or, loose, woman, however, these, statements, are, not, supported, by, the, canonical, gospels, which, at, no, point, imply, that, she, had, ever, been, a, prostitute, or, in, any, way, notable, for, a, sinful, way, of, life, the, misconception, likely, arose, due, to, a, conflation, between, mary, magdalene, mary, of, bethany, who, anoints, jesus, s, feet, in, john, 11, 1, 12, and, the, unnamed, sinful, woman, who, anoints, jesus, s, feet, in, luke, 7, 36, 50, as, early, as, the, third, century, the, church, father, tertullian, c, 160, 225, references, the, touch, of, the, woman, which, was, a, sinner, in, effort, to, prove, that, jesus, was, not, a, phantom, but, really, a, solid, body, this, may, indicate, that, mary, magdalene, was, already, being, conflated, with, the, sinful, woman, in, luke, 7, 36, 50, though, tertullian, never, clearly, identifies, the, woman, of, whom, he, speaks, as, mary, magdalene, a, sermon, attributed, to, hippolytus, of, rome, c, 170, 235, refers, to, mary, of, bethany, and, her, sister, martha, seeking, jesus, in, the, garden, like, mary, magdalene, in, john, 20, indicating, a, conflation, between, mary, of, bethany, and, mary, magdalene, the, sermon, describes, the, conflated, woman, as, a, second, eve, who, compensates, for, the, disobedience, of, the, first, eve, through, her, obedience, the, sermon, also, explicitly, identifies, mary, magdalene, and, the, other, women, as, apostles, the, first, clear, identification, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, redeemed, sinner, comes, from, ephrem, the, syrian, c, 306, 373, part, of, the, reason, for, the, identification, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, sinner, may, derive, from, the, reputation, of, her, birthplace, magdala, which, by, the, late, first, century, was, infamous, for, its, inhabitants, alleged, vice, and, licentiousness, in, one, of, his, preserved, sayings, gregory, of, nyssa, c, 330, 395, identifies, mary, magdalene, as, the, first, witness, to, the, resurrection, that, she, might, set, straight, again, by, her, faith, in, the, resurrection, what, was, turned, over, in, her, transgression, ambrose, c, 340, 397, by, contrast, not, only, rejected, the, conflation, of, mary, magdalene, mary, of, bethany, and, the, anointing, sinner, but, even, proposed, that, the, authentic, mary, magdalene, was, in, fact, two, separate, people, one, woman, named, mary, magdalene, who, discovered, the, empty, tomb, and, a, different, mary, magdalene, who, saw, the, risen, christ, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, entertained, the, possibility, that, mary, of, bethany, and, the, unnamed, sinner, from, luke, might, be, the, same, person, but, did, not, associate, mary, magdalene, with, either, of, them, instead, augustine, praised, mary, magdalene, as, unquestionably, surpassingly, more, ardent, in, her, love, than, these, other, women, who, had, administered, to, the, lord, the, unnamed, sinful, woman, in, luke, 7, 36, 50, is, never, identified, as, a, prostitute, and, in, jewish, society, at, the, time, the, gospel, was, written, sinful, could, have, simply, meant, that, she, did, not, assiduously, observe, the, law, of, moses, the, notion, of, mary, magdalene, specifically, being, a, former, prostitute, or, loose, woman, dates, to, a, narrative, in, an, influential, homily, by, pope, gregory, i, gregory, the, great, in, around, 591, in, which, he, not, only, identifies, magdalene, with, the, anonymous, sinner, with, the, perfume, in, luke, s, gospel, and, with, mary, of, bethany, the, sister, of, martha, and, lazarus, but, also, for, the, first, time, explicitly, identifies, her, sins, as, ones, of, a, sexual, nature, she, whom, luke, calls, the, sinful, woman, whom, john, calls, mary, we, believe, to, be, the, mary, from, whom, seven, devils, were, ejected, according, to, mark, what, did, these, seven, devils, signify, if, not, all, the, vices, it, is, clear, that, the, woman, previously, used, the, unguent, to, perfume, her, flesh, in, forbidden, acts, what, she, therefore, displayed, more, scandalously, she, was, now, offering, to, god, in, a, more, praiseworthy, manner, she, had, coveted, with, earthly, eyes, but, now, through, penitence, these, are, consumed, with, tears, she, displayed, her, hair, to, set, off, her, face, but, now, her, hair, dries, her, tears, she, had, spoken, proud, things, with, her, mouth, but, in, kissing, the, lord, s, feet, she, now, planted, her, mouth, on, the, redeemer, s, feet, for, every, delight, therefore, she, had, had, in, herself, she, now, immolated, herself, she, turned, the, mass, of, her, crimes, to, virtues, in, order, to, serve, god, entirely, in, penance, in, pope, gregory, s, interpretation, the, seven, demons, expelled, from, mary, magdalene, by, jesus, are, transformed, into, the, seven, deadly, sins, of, medieval, catholicism, leading, mary, to, be, condemned, not, only, for, lust, but, for, pride, and, covetousness, as, well, the, aspect, of, the, repentant, sinner, became, almost, equally, significant, as, the, disciple, in, her, persona, as, depicted, in, western, art, and, religious, literature, fitting, well, with, the, great, importance, of, penitence, in, medieval, theology, in, subsequent, religious, legend, mary, s, story, became, conflated, with, that, of, mary, of, egypt, a, repentant, prostitute, who, then, lived, as, a, hermit, with, that, mary, s, image, was, according, to, susan, haskins, author, of, mary, magdalene, myth, and, metaphor, finally, settled, for, nearly, fourteen, hundred, years, although, in, fact, the, most, important, late, medieval, popular, accounts, of, her, life, describe, her, as, a, rich, woman, whose, life, of, sexual, freedom, is, purely, for, pleasure, this, composite, depiction, of, mary, magdalene, was, carried, into, the, mass, texts, for, her, feast, day, in, the, tridentine, mass, the, collect, explicitly, identifies, her, as, mary, of, bethany, by, describing, lazarus, as, her, brother, and, the, gospel, is, the, story, of, the, penitent, woman, anointing, jesus, s, feet, the, composite, magdalene, was, never, accepted, by, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, who, saw, only, mary, the, disciple, and, believed, that, after, the, resurrection, she, lived, as, a, companion, to, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, and, not, even, in, the, west, was, it, universally, accepted, the, benedictine, order, always, celebrated, mary, of, bethany, together, with, martha, and, lazarus, of, bethany, on, july, 29, while, mary, magdalene, was, celebrated, on, july, 22, not, only, john, chrysostom, in, the, east, matthew, homily, 88, but, also, ambrose, de, virginitate, 3, 14, 4, 15, in, the, west, when, speaking, of, mary, magdalene, after, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, far, from, calling, her, a, harlot, suggest, she, was, a, virgin, starting, in, around, the, eighth, century, christian, sources, record, mention, of, a, church, in, magdala, purported, to, have, been, built, on, the, site, of, mary, magdalene, s, house, where, jesus, exorcized, her, of, the, seven, demons, in, an, eastern, tradition, supported, by, the, western, bishop, and, historian, gregory, of, tours, c, 538, 594, mary, magdalene, is, said, to, have, retired, to, ephesus, in, asia, minor, with, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, where, they, both, lived, out, the, rest, of, their, lives, gregory, states, that, mary, magdalene, was, buried, in, the, city, of, ephesus, modestus, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, from, 630, until, 634, describes, a, slightly, different, tradition, that, mary, magdalene, had, come, to, ephesus, to, live, with, the, apostle, john, following, the, death, of, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, starting, in, early, high, middle, ages, writers, in, western, europe, began, developing, elaborate, fictional, biographies, of, mary, magdalene, s, life, in, which, they, heavily, embellished, upon, the, vague, details, given, in, the, gospels, stories, about, noble, saints, were, popular, during, this, time, period, accordingly, tales, of, mary, magdalene, s, wealth, and, social, status, became, heavily, exaggerated, in, the, tenth, century, odo, of, cluny, c, 880, 942, wrote, a, sermon, in, which, he, described, mary, as, an, extraordinarily, wealthy, noblewoman, of, royal, descent, some, manuscripts, of, the, sermon, record, that, mary, s, parents, were, named, syrus, and, eucharia, and, one, manuscript, goes, into, great, detail, describing, her, family, s, purported, land, holdings, in, bethany, jerusalem, and, magdala, the, theologian, honorius, augustodunensis, c, 1080, c, 1151, embellished, this, tale, even, further, reporting, that, mary, was, a, wealthy, noblewoman, who, was, married, in, magdalum, but, that, she, committed, adultery, so, she, fled, to, jerusalem, and, became, a, public, sinner, vulgaris, meretrix, honorius, mentions, that, out, of, love, for, jesus, mary, repented, and, withdrew, into, a, life, of, quiet, isolation, under, the, influence, of, stories, about, other, female, saints, such, as, mary, of, egypt, and, pelagia, painters, in, italy, during, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, gradually, began, to, develop, the, image, of, mary, magdalene, living, alone, in, the, desert, as, a, penitent, ascetic, this, portrayal, became, so, popular, that, it, quickly, spread, to, germany, and, england, from, the, twelfth, century, abbot, hugh, of, semur, died, 1109, peter, abelard, died, 1142, and, geoffrey, of, vend, me, died, 1132, all, referred, to, mary, magdalene, as, the, sinner, who, merited, the, title, apostolorum, apostola, apostle, to, the, apostles, with, the, title, becoming, commonplace, during, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, centuries, in, western, europe, elaborate, and, conflicting, legends, began, to, develop, which, said, that, mary, magdalene, had, travelled, to, southern, france, and, died, there, starting, in, around, 1050, the, monks, of, the, v, zelay, abbey, of, la, madaleine, in, burgundy, said, they, discovered, mary, magdalene, s, actual, skeleton, at, first, the, existence, of, the, skeleton, was, merely, asserted, but, in, 1265, the, monks, made, a, spectacular, public, show, of, discovering, it, and, in, 1267, the, bones, were, brought, before, the, king, of, france, who, venerated, them, on, december, 9, 1279, an, excavation, ordered, by, charles, ii, king, of, naples, at, saint, maximin, la, sainte, baume, provence, led, to, the, discovery, of, another, purported, burial, of, mary, magdalene, the, shrine, was, purportedly, found, intact, with, an, explanatory, inscription, stating, why, the, relics, had, been, hidden, charles, ii, commissioned, the, building, of, a, new, gothic, basilica, on, the, site, and, in, return, for, providing, accommodation, for, pilgrims, the, town, s, residents, were, exempt, from, taxes, saint, maximin, la, sainte, baume, gradually, displaced, v, zelay, in, popularity, and, acceptance, the, most, famous, account, of, mary, magdalene, s, legendary, life, comes, from, the, golden, legend, a, collection, of, medieval, saints, stories, compiled, circa, 1260, by, the, italian, writer, and, dominican, friar, jacobus, de, voragine, c, 1230, 1298, in, this, account, mary, magdalene, is, in, ehrman, s, words, fabulously, rich, insanely, beautiful, and, outrageously, sensual, but, she, gives, up, her, life, of, wealth, and, sin, to, become, a, devoted, follower, of, jesus, fourteen, years, after, jesus, s, crucifixion, some, pagans, throw, mary, martha, lazarus, who, in, this, account, is, their, brother, due, to, a, conflation, with, mary, of, bethany, and, two, other, christians, named, maximin, and, cedonius, onto, a, rudderless, boat, in, the, mediterranean, to, die, miraculously, however, the, boat, washes, ashore, at, marseille, in, southern, france, mary, persuades, the, governor, of, the, city, not, to, offer, sacrifices, to, a, pagan, god, and, later, persuades, him, to, convert, to, christianity, after, she, proves, the, christian, god, s, power, by, successfully, praying, to, him, to, make, the, governor, s, wife, pregnant, the, governor, and, his, wife, sail, for, rome, to, meet, the, apostle, peter, in, person, but, their, ship, is, struck, by, a, storm, which, causes, the, wife, to, go, into, labor, the, wife, dies, in, childbirth, and, the, governor, leaves, her, on, an, island, with, the, still, living, infant, at, her, breast, the, governor, spends, two, years, with, peter, in, rome, and, on, his, way, home, he, stops, at, the, same, island, to, discover, that, due, to, mary, magdalene, s, miraculous, long, distance, intercession, his, child, has, survived, for, two, years, on, his, dead, mother, s, breast, milk, then, the, governor, s, wife, rises, from, the, dead, and, tells, him, that, mary, magdalene, has, brought, her, back, the, whole, family, returns,

chronicler, peter, of, vaux, de, cernay, said, it, was, part, of, catharist, belief, that, the, earthly, jesus, christ, had, a, relationship, with, mary, magdalene, described, as, his, concubine, further, in, their, secret, meetings, they, said, that, the, christ, who, was, born, in, the, earthly, and, visible, bethlehem, and, crucified, at, jerusalem, was, evil, and, that, mary, magdalene, was, his, concubine, and, that, she, was, the, woman, taken, in, adultery, who, is, referred, to, in, the, scriptures, a, document, possibly, written, by, ermengaud, of, b, ziers, undated, and, anonymous, and, attached, to, his, treatise, against, heretics, makes, a, similar, statement, also, they, teach, in, their, secret, meetings, that, mary, magdalene, was, the, wife, of, christ, she, was, the, samaritan, woman, to, whom, he, said, call, thy, husband, she, was, the, woman, taken, into, adultery, whom, christ, set, free, lest, the, jews, stone, her, and, she, was, with, him, in, three, places, in, the, temple, at, the, well, and, in, the, garden, after, the, resurrection, he, appeared, first, to, her, in, the, middle, of, the, fourteenth, century, a, dominican, friar, wrote, a, biography, of, mary, magdalene, in, which, he, described, her, brutally, mutilating, herself, after, giving, up, prostitution, clawing, at, her, legs, until, they, bled, tearing, out, clumps, of, her, hair, and, beating, her, face, with, her, fists, and, her, breasts, with, stones, this, portrayal, of, her, inspired, the, sculptor, donatello, c, 1386, 1466, to, portray, her, as, a, gaunt, and,

days, of, christ, in, which, he, argued, against, the, conflation, of, mary, magdalene, mary, of, bethany, and, the, unnamed, sinner, in, luke, various, authors, published, a, flurry, of, books, and, pamphlets, in, response, the, vast, majority, of, which, opposed, lef, vre, d, taples, in, 1521, the, theology, faculty, of, the, sorbonne, formally, condemned, the, idea, that, the, three, women, were, separate, people, as, heretical, and, debate, died, down, overtaken, by, the, larger, issues, raised, by, martin, luther, luther, and, huldrych, zwingli, 1484, 1531, both, supported, the, composite, magdalene, luther, whose, views, on, sexuality, were, much, more, liberal, than, those, of, his, fellow, reformers, reportedly, once, joked, to, a, group, of, friends, that, even, pious, christ, himself, had, committed, adultery, three, times, once, with, mary, magdalene, once, with, the, samaritan, woman, at, the, well, and, once, with, the, adulteress, he, had, let, off, so, easily, because, the, cult, of, mary, magdalene, was, inextricably, associated, with, the, catholic, teaching, of, the, intercession, of, saints, it, came, under, particularly, harsh, criticism, by, protestant, leaders, zwingli, demanded, for, the, cult, of, mary, magdalene, to, be, abolished, and, all, images, of, her, to, be, destroyed, john, calvin, 1509, 1564, not, only, rejected, the, composite, magdalene, but, criticized, catholics, as, ignorant, for, having, ever, believed, in, it, during, the, counter, reformation, roman, catholicism, began, to, strongly, emphasize, mary, magdalene, s, role, as, a, penitent, sinner, her, medieval, role, as, a, patron, and, advocate, became, minimized, and, her, penitence, became, regarded, as, her, most, important, aspect, especially, in, france, and, in, the, catholic, portions, of, southern, germany, a, massive, number, of, baroque, paintings, and, sculptures, depict, the, penitent, magdalene, often, showing, her, naked, or, partially, naked, with, a, strong, emphasis, on, her, erotic, beauty, poems, about, mary, magdalene, s, repentance, were, also, popular, anton, giulio, brignole, sale, s, maria, maddalena, peccatrice,

and, dwellings, where, the, nobility, could, retreat, to, find, religious, solace, they, were, usually, located, in, wild, areas, away, from, the, rest, of, the, property, and, their, exteriors, were,

identification, of, mary, magdalene, with, other, new, testament, figures, was, omitted, in, the, 1969, revision, of, the, general, roman, calendar, with, the, comment, regarding, her, liturgical, celebration, on, july, 22, no, change, has, been, made, in, the, title, of, today, s, memorial, but, it, concerns, only, saint, mary, magdalene, to, whom, christ, appeared, after, his, resurrection, it, is, not, about, the, sister, of, saint, martha, nor, about, the, sinful, woman, whose, sins, the, lord, forgave, elsewhere, it, said, of, the, roman, liturgy, of, july, 22, that, it, will, make, mention, neither, of, mary, of, bethany, nor, of, the, sinful, woman, of, luke, 7, 36, 50, but, only, of, mary, magdalene, the, first, person, to, whom, christ, appeared, after, his, resurrection, according, to, historian, michael, haag, these, changes, were, a, quiet, admission, from, the, vatican, that, the, church, s, previous, teaching, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, repentant, whore, had, been, wrong, mary, of, bethany, s, feast, day, and, that, of, her, brother, lazarus, is, now, on, july, 29, the, memorial, of, their, sister, martha, nonetheless, despite, the, vatican, s, rejection, of, it, the, view, of, mary, as, a, repentant, prostitute, only, grew, more, prevalent, in, popular, culture, she, is, portrayed, as, one, in, nikos, kazantzakis, s, 1955, novel, the, last, temptation, of, christ, and, martin, scorsese, s, 1988, film, adaptation, of, it, in, which, jesus, as, he, is, dying, on, the, cross, has, a, vision, from, satan, of, what, it, would, be, like, if, he, married, mary, magdalene, and, raised, a, family, with, her, instead, of, dying, for, humanity, s, sins, mary, is, likewise, portrayed, as, a, reformed, prostitute, in, andrew, lloyd, webber, and, tim, rice, s, 1971, rock, opera, jesus, christ, superstar, in, superstar, mary, describes, her, sexual, attraction, to, jesus, in, the, song, i, don, t, know, how, to, love, him, which, shocked, many, of, the, play, s, original, viewers, ki, longfellow, s, novel, the, secret, magdalene, 2005, draws, on, the, gnostic, gospels, and, other, sources, to, portray, mary, as, a, brilliant, and, dynamic, woman, who, studies, at, the, fabled, library, of, alexandria, and, shares, her, knowledge, with, jesus, lady, gaga, s, song, judas, 2011, is, sung, from, mary, s, perspective, portraying, her, as, a, prostitute, who, is, beyond, repentance, the, 2018, film, mary, magdalene, starring, rooney, mara, as, the, eponymous, character, sought, to, reverse, the, centuries, old, portrayal, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, repentant, prostitute, while, also, combating, the, conspiracy, statements, of, her, being, jesus, s, wife, or, sexual, partner, instead, the, film, portrays, her, as, jesus, s, closest, disciple, and, the, only, one, who, truly, understands, his, teachings, this, portrayal, is, partially, based, on, the, gnostic, gospel, of, mary, magdalene, the, film, which, has, been, described, as, having, a, strongly, feminist, bent, was, praised, for, its, music, score, and, cinematography, its, surprising, faithfulness, to, the, biblical, narrative, and, its, acting, but, was, criticized, as, slow, moving, overwritten, and, too, solemn, to, be, believable, it, was, also, criticized, by, many, christians, who, were, offended, by, the, film, s, use, of, extracanonical, source, material, the, early, notion, of, mary, magdalene, as, a, sinner, and, adulteress, was, reflected, in, western, medieval, christian, art, where, she, was, the, most, commonly, depicted, female, figure, after, the, virgin, mary, she, may, be, shown, either, as, very, extravagantly, and, fashionably, dressed, unlike, other, female, figures, wearing, contemporary, styles, of, clothes, or, alternatively, as, completely, naked, but, covered, by, very, long, blonde, or, reddish, blonde, hair, the, latter, depictions, represent, the, penitent, magdalene, according, to, the, medieval, legend, that, she, had, spent, a, period, of, repentance, as, a, desert, hermit, after, leaving, her, life, as, a, follower, of, jesus, her, story, became, conflated, in, the, west, with, that, of, mary, of, egypt, a, fourth, century, prostitute, turned, hermit, whose, clothes, wore, out, and, fell, off, in, the, desert, the, widespread, artistic, representations, of, mary, magdalene, in, tears, are, the, source, of, the, modern, english, word, maudlin, meaning, sickeningly, sentimental, or, emotional, in, medieval, depictions, mary, s, long, hair, entirely, covers, her, body, and, preserves, her, modesty, supplemented, in, some, german, versions, such, as, one, by, tilman, riemenschneider, by, thick, body, hair, but, from, the, sixteenth, century, some, depictions, like, those, by, titian, show, part, of, her, naked, body, the, amount, of, nudity, tending, to, increase, in, successive, periods, even, if, covered, she, often, wears, only, a, drape, pulled, around, her, or, an, undergarment, in, particular, mary, is, often, shown, naked, in, the, legendary, scene, of, her, elevation, where, she, is, sustained, in, the, desert, by, angels, who, raise, her, up, and, feed, her, heavenly, manna, as, recounted, in, the, golden, legend, mary, magdalene, at, the, foot, of, the, cross, during, the, crucifixion, appears, in, an, eleventh, century, english, manuscript, as, an, expressional, device, rather, than, a, historical, motif, intended, as, the, expression, of, an, emotional, assimilation, of, the, event, that, leads, the, spectator, to, identify, himself, with, the, mourners, other, isolated, depictions, occur, but, from, the, thirteenth, century, additions, to, the, virgin, mary, and, john, as, the, spectators, at, the, crucifixion, become, more, common, with, mary, magdalene, as, the, most, frequently, found, either, kneeling, at, the, foot, of, the, cross, clutching, the, shaft, sometimes, kissing, christ, s, feet, or, standing, usually, at, the, left, and, behind, mary, and, john, with, her, arms, stretched, upwards, towards, christ, in, a, gesture, of, grief, as, in, a, damaged, painting, by, cimabue, in, the, upper, church, at, assisi, of, c, 1290, a, kneeling, magdalene, by, giotto, in, the, scrovegni, chapel, c, 1305, was, especially, influential, as, gothic, painted, crucifixions, became, crowded, compositions, the, magdalene, became, a, prominent, figure, with, a, halo, and, identifiable, by, her, long, unbound, blonde, hair, and, usually, a, bright, red, dress, as, the, swooning, virgin, mary, became, more, common, generally, occupying, the, attention, of, john, the, unrestrained, gestures, of, magdalene, increasingly, represented, the, main, display, of, the, grief, of, the, spectators, according, to, robert, kiely, no, figure, in, the, christian, pantheon, except, jesus, the, virgin, mary, and, john, the, baptist, has, inspired, provoked, or, confounded, the, imagination, of, painters, more, than, the, magdalene, apart, from, the, crucifixion, mary, was, often, shown, in, scenes, of, the, passion, of, jesus, when, mentioned, in, the, gospels, such, as, the, crucifixion, christ, carrying, the, cross, and, noli, me, tangere, but, usually, omitted, in, other, scenes, showing, the, twelve, apostles, such, as, the, last, supper, as, mary, of, bethany, she, is, shown, as, present, at, the, resurrection, of, lazarus, her, brother, and, in, the, scene, with, jesus, and, her, sister, martha, which, began, to, be, depicted, often, in, the, seventeenth, century, as, in, christ, in, the, house, of, martha, and, mary, by, vel, zquez, gallery, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, never, identified, mary, magdalene, with, mary, of, bethany, or, the, sinful, woman, who, anoints, jesus, in, luke, 7, 36, 50, and, has, always, taught, that, mary, was, a, virtuous, woman, her, entire, life, even, before, her, conversion, they, have, never, celebrated, her, as, a, penitent, mary, magdalene, s, image, did, not, become, conflated, with, other, women, mentioned, in, biblical, texts, until, pope, gregory, the, great, s, sermon, in, the, sixth, century, and, even, then, this, only, occurred, in, western, traditions, instead, she, has, traditionally, been, honored, as, a, myrrhbearer, the, equivalent, of, the, western, three, marys, and, equal, to, the, apostles, for, centuries, it, has, been, the, custom, of, many, eastern, orthodox, christians, to, share, dyed, and, painted, eggs, particularly, on, easter, sunday, the, eggs, represent, new, life, and, christ, bursting, forth, from, the, tomb, among, eastern, orthodox, christians, this, sharing, is, accompanied, by, the, proclamation, christ, is, risen, one, folk, tradition, concerning, mary, magdalene, says, that, following, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, she, used, her, position, to, gain, an, invitation, to, a, banquet, given, by, the, roman, emperor, tiberius, in, rome, when, she, met, him, she, held, a, plain, egg, in, her, hand, and, exclaimed, christ, is, risen, the, emperor, laughed, and, said, that, christ, rising, from, the, dead, was, as, likely, as, the, egg, in, her, hand, turning, red, while, she, held, it, before, he, finished, speaking, the, egg, in, her, hand, turned, a, bright, red, and, she, continued, proclaiming, the, gospel, to, the, entire, imperial, house, during, the, counter, reformation, and, baroque, periods, late, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, description, penitent, was, added, to, the, indication, of, her, name, on, her, feast, day, july, 22, it, had, not, yet, been, added, at, the, time, of, the, tridentine, calendar, of, 1569, and, is, no, longer, found, in, the, present, general, roman, calendar, but, once, added, it, remained, until, the, general, roman, calendar, of, 1960, the, gospel, reading, in, the, tridentine, mass, was, luke, 7, 36, 50, the, sinful, woman, anointing, the, feet, of, jesus, while, in, the, present, version, of, the, roman, rite, of, mass, it, is, john, 20, 1, 2, 11, 18, meeting, of, mary, magdalene, with, jesus, after, his, resurrection, according, to, darrell, bock, the, title, of, apostola, apostolorum, first, appears, in, the, 10th, century, but, katherine, ludwig, jansen, says, she, found, no, reference, to, it, earlier, than, the, 12th, century, by, which, time, it, was, already, commonplace, she, mentions, in, particular, hugh, of, cluny, 1024, 1109, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, and, bernard, of, clairvaux, 1090, 1153, among, those, who, gave, mary, magdalene, the, title, of, apostolorum, apostola, apostle, of, the, apostles, jane, schaberg, adds, geoffrey, of, vend, me, c, 1065, 70, 1132, the, equivalent, of, the, phrase, apostolorum, apostola, may, have, appeared, already, in, the, 9th, century, chapter, xxvii, of, the, life, of, mary, magdalene, attributed, to, hrabanus, maurus, c, 780, 784, february, 856, is, headed, ubi, magdalenam, christus, ad, apostolos, mittit, apostolam, wherein, christ, sends, magdalene, as, an, apostle, to, the, apostles, the, same, chapter, says, she, did, not, delay, in, exercising, the, office, of, apostolate, with, which, he, had, been, honored, apostolatus, officio, quo, honorata, fuerat, fungi, non, distulit, raymond, e, brown, commenting, on, this, fact, remarks, that, hrabanus, maurus, frequently, applies, the, word, apostle, to, mary, magdalene, in, this, work, however, the, work, is, actually, no, earlier, than, the, 12th, century, because, of, mary, magdalene, s, position, as, an, apostle, though, not, one, of, those, who, became, official, witnesses, to, the, resurrection, the, catholic, church, honored, her, by, reciting, the, gloria, on, her, feast, day, the, only, female, saint, so, honored, apart, from, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, in, his, apostolic, letter, mulieris, dignitatem, on, the, dignity, and, vocation, of, women, parts, 67, 69, dated, august, 15, 1988, pope, john, paul, ii, dealt, with, the, easter, events, in, relation, to, the, women, being, present, at, the, tomb, after, the, resurrection, in, a, section, entitled, first, witnesses, of, the, resurrection, the, women, are, the, first, at, the, tomb, they, are, the, first, to, find, it, empty, they, are, the, first, to, hear, he, is, not, here, he, has, risen, as, he, said, they, are, the, first, to, embrace, his, feet, the, women, are, also, the, first, to, be, called, to, announce, this, truth, to, the, apostles, the, gospel, of, john, emphasizes, the, special, role, of, mary, magdalene, she, is, the, first, to, meet, the, risen, christ, hence, she, came, to, be, called, the, apostle, of, the, apostles, mary, magdalene, was, the, first, eyewitness, of, the, risen, christ, and, for, this, reason, she, was, also, the, first, to, bear, witness, to, him, before, the, apostles, this, event, in, a, sense, crowns, all, that, has, been, said, previously, about, christ, entrusting, divine, truths, to, women, as, well, as, men, on, june, 10, 2016, the, congregation, for, divine, worship, and, the, discipline, of, the, sacraments, issued, a, decree, which, elevated, mary, s, liturgical, commemoration, from, an, obligatory, memorial, to, a, feast, day, like, that, of, most, of, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, are, jointly, commemorated, with, a, solemnity, the, mass, and, liturgy, of, the, hours, divine, office, remain, the, same, as, they, were, except, that, a, specific, preface, was, added, to, the, mass, to, refer, to, her, explicitly, as, the, apostle, to, the, apostles, the, 1549, book, of, common, prayer, had, on, july, 22, a, feast, of, saint, mary, magdalene, with, the, same, scripture, readings, as, in, the, tridentine, mass, and, with, a, newly, composed, collect, merciful, father, geue, us, grace, that,

the, 1552, edition, omitted, the, feast, of, saint, mary, magdalene, which, was, restored, to, the, book, of, common, prayer, only, after, some, 400, years, modern, protestants, honor, her, as, a, disciple, and, friend, of, jesus, anglican, christians, refer, to, her, as, a, saint, and, may, follow, her, example, of, repentance, while, some, interpret, the, thirty, nine, articles, as, forbidding, them, to, call, upon, her, for, intercession, other, anglicans, citing, the, episcopal, burial, service, say, they, can, ask, the, saint, to, pray, for, them, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, honors, mary, magdalene, on, july, 22, as, an, apostle, her, feast, day, is, marked, as, a, lesser, festival, which, are, defined, as, days, when, we, celebrate, the, life, of, christ, the, witness, of, those, who, accompanied, and, testified, to, him, and, the, gifts, of, god, in, the, church, presbyterians, honor, her, as, the, apostle, to, the, apostles, and, in, the, book, methodist, theology, kenneth, wilson, describes, her, as, in, effect, one, of, the, first, missionaries, mary, magdalene, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, festival, and, in, the, episcopal, church, with, a, major, feast, on, july, 22, there, are, many, references, to, mary, magdalene, in, the, writings, of, the, bah, faith, where, she, enjoys, an, exalted, status, as, a, heroine, of, faith, and, the, archetypal, woman, of, all, cycles, abdu, l, bah, the, son, of, the, founder, of, the, religion, said, that, she, was, the, channel, of, confirmation, to, jesus, s, disciples, a, heroine, who, re, established, the, faith, of, the, apostles, and, was, a, light, of, nearness, in, his, kingdom, abdu, l, bah, also, wrote, that, her, reality, is, ever, shining, from, the, horizon, of, christ, her, face, is, shining, and, beaming, forth, on, the, horizon, of, the, universe, forevermore, and, that, her, candle, is, in, the, assemblage, of, the, world, lighted, till, eternity, abdu, l, bah, considered, her, to, be, the, supreme, example, of, how, women, are, completely, equal, with, men, in, the, sight, of, god, and, can, at, times, even, exceed, men, in, holiness, and, greatness, indeed, he, said, that, she, surpassed, all, the, men, of, her, time, and, that, crowns, studded, with, the, brilliant, jewels, of, guidance, were, upon, her, head, the, bah, writings, also, expand, upon, the, scarce, references, to, her, life, in, the, canonical, gospels, with, a, wide, array, of, extra, canonical, stories, about, her, and, sayings, which, are, not, recorded, in, any, other, extant, historical, sources, abdu, l, bah, said, that, mary, traveled, to, rome, and, spoke, before, the, emperor, tiberius, which, is, presumably, why, pilate, was, later, recalled, to, rome, for, his, cruel, treatment, of, the, jews, a, tradition, also, attested, to, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, bah, s, have, noted, parallels, between, mary, magdalene, and, the, bab, heroine, poet, t, hirih, the, two, are, similar, in, many, respects, with, mary, magdalene, often, being, viewed, as, a, christian, antecedent, of, the, latter, while, t, hirih, in, her, own, right, could, be, described, as, the, spiritual, return, of, the, magdalene, especially, given, their, common, shared, attributes, of, knowledge, steadfastness, courage, virtue, and, will, power, in, addition, to, their, importance, within, the, religious, movements, of, christianity, and, the, bah, faith, as, female, leaders, many, of, the, alleged, relics, of, the, saint, are, held, in, catholic, churches, in, france, especially, at, saint, maximin, la, sainte, baume, where, her, skull, see, above, and, the, noli, me, tangere, are, on, display, the, latter, being, a, piece, of, forehead, flesh, and, skin, said, to, be, from, the, spot, touched, by, jesus, at, the, post, resurrection, encounter, in, the, garden, a, tibia, also, kept, at, saint, maximin, la, sainte, baume, is, the, object, of, an, annual, procession, her, left, hand, relic, is, kept, in, the, simonopetra, monastery, on, mount, athos, in, 1998, ramon, k, jusino, proposed, an, unprecedented, argument, that, the, beloved, disciple, of, the, gospel, of, john, is, mary, magdalene, jusino, based, his, argument, largely, on, the, nag, hammadi, gnostic, books, rejecting, the, view, of, raymond, e, brown, that, these, books, were, later, developments, and, maintaining, instead, that, the, extant, gospel, of, john, is, the, result, of, modification, of, an, earlier, text, that, presented, mary, magdalene, as, the, beloved, disciple, the, gospel, at, least, in, its, current, form, clearly, and, consistently, identifies, the, disciple, as, having, masculine, gender, only, ever, referring, to, him, using, words, inflected, in, the, masculine, there, are, no, textual, variants, in, extant, new, testament, manuscripts, to, contradict, this, and, thus, no, physical, evidence, of, this, hypothetical, earlier, document, richard, j, hooper, does, not, make, the, jusino, thesis, his, own, but, says, perhaps, we, should, not, altogether, reject, the, possibility, that, some, johannine, christians, considered, mary, magdalene, to, be, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, esther, a, de, boer, likewise, presents, the, idea, as, one, possibility, among, others, not, as, a, definitive, solution, to, the, problem, of, the, identity, of, the, anonymous, disciple, there, is, a, theological, interpretation, of, mary, as, the, magdala, the, elegant, tower, and, certain, churches, honor, her, as, a, heroine, of, the, faith, in, their, teachings, dan, brown, s, 2003, bestselling, mystery, thriller, novel, the, da, vinci, code, popularized, a, number, of, erroneous, ideas, about, mary, magdalene, including, that, she, was, a, member, of, the, tribe, of, benjamin, that, she, was, jesus, s, wife, that, she, was, pregnant, at, the, crucifixion, and, that, she, gave, birth, to, jesus, s, child, who, became, the, founder, of, a, bloodline, which, survives, to, this, very, day, there, is, no, historical, evidence, from, the, canonical, or, apocryphal, gospels, other, early, christian, writings, or, any, other, ancient, sources, to, support, these, statements, the, da, vinci, code, also, purports, that, the, figure, of, the, beloved, disciple, to, jesus, s, right, in, leonardo, da, vinci, s, last, supper, is, mary, magdalene, disguised, as, one, of, the, male, disciples, art, historians, maintain, that, the, figure, is, in, reality, the, apostle, john, who, only, appears, feminine, due, to, leonardo, s, characteristic, fascination, with, blurring, the, lines, between, the, sexes, a, quality, which, is, found, in, his, other, paintings, such, as, saint, john, the, baptist, painted, c, 1513, 1516, furthermore, according, to, ross, king, an, expert, on, italian, art, mary, magdalene, s, appearance, at, the, last, supper, would, not, have, been, controversial, and, leonardo, would, have, had, no, motive, to, disguise, her, as, one, of, the, other, disciples, since, she, was, widely, venerated, in, her, role, as, the, apostle, to, the, apostles, and, patron, of, the, dominican, order, for, whom, the, last, supper, was, painted, there, would, have, even, been, precedent, for, it, since, the, earlier, italian, renaissance, painter, fra, angelico, had, included, her, in, his, painting, of, the, last, supper, numerous, works, were, written, in, response, to, the, historical, inaccuracies, in, the, da, vinci, code, but, the, novel, still, exerted, massive, influence, on, how, members, of, the, general, public, viewed, mary, magdalene, in, 2012, scholar, karen, l, king, published, the, gospel, of, jesus, s, wife, a, purported, coptic, papyrus, fragment, in, which, jesus, says, my, wife, she, will, be, able, to, be, my, disciple, the, overwhelming, consensus, of, scholars, is, that, the, fragment, is, a, modern, forgery, and, in, 2016, king, herself, said, that, the, alleged, gospel, was, likely, a, forgery, ehrman, states, that, the, historical, sources, reveal, absolutely, nothing, about, jesus, s, sexuality, and, that, there, is, no, evidence, whatsoever, to, support, the, idea, that, jesus, and, mary, magdalene, were, married, or, that, they, had, any, kind, of, sexual, or, romantic, relationship, none, of, the, canonical, gospels, imply, such, a, thing, and, even, in, the, late, gnostic, gospels, where, mary, is, shown, as, jesus, s, closest, disciple, the, relationship, between, them, is, not, sexual, the, extremely, late, greater, questions, of, mary, which, has, not, survived, allegedly, portrayed, mary, not, as, jesus, s, wife, or, partner, but, rather, as, an, unwilling, voyeur, ehrman, says, that, the, essenes, a, contemporary, jewish, sect, who, shared, many, views, with, jesus, and, the, apostle, paul, jesus, s, later, follower, both, lived, in, unmarried, celibacy, so, it, is, not, unreasonable, to, conclude, that, jesus, did, as, well, furthermore, according, to, mark, 12, 25, jesus, taught, that, marriage, would, not, exist, at, all, in, the, coming, kingdom, of, god, since, jesus, taught, that, people, should, live, as, though, the, kingdom, had, already, arrived, this, teaching, implied, a, life, of, unmarried, celibacy, ehrman, says, that, if, jesus, had, been, married, to, mary, magdalene, the, authors, of, the, gospels, would, definitely, have, mentioned, it, since, they, mention, all, his, other, family, members, including, his, mother, mary, his, father, joseph, his, four, brothers, and, his, at, least, two, sisters, maurice, casey, rejects, the, idea, of, mary, magdalene, as, jesus, s, wife, as, nothing, more, than, wild, popular, sensationalism, jeffrey, j, kripal, writes, that, the, historical, sources, are, simply, too, contradictory, and, simultaneously, too, silent, to, make, absolute, declarations, regarding, jesus, s, sexuality, almond, philip, c, mary,
