religiosity, and, dynastic, awareness, the, theologian, joseph, othmar, von, rauscher, conveyed, to, him, the, inviolable, understanding, of, rulership, of, divine, origin, divine, grace, and, therefore, a, belief, that, no, participation, of, the, population, in, rulership, in, the, form, of, parliaments, was, required, the, educators, heinrich, franz, von, bombelles, and, colonel, johann, baptist, coronini, cronberg, ordered, archduke, franz, to, study, an, enormous, amount, of, time, which, initially, comprised, 18, hours, per, week, and, was, expanded, to, 50, hours, per, week, by, the, age, of, 16, one, of, the, main, focuses, of, the, lessons, was, language, acquisition, in, addition, to, french, the, diplomatic, language, of, the, time, latin, and, ancient, greek, hungarian, czech, italian, and, polish, were, the, most, important, national, languages, of, the, monarchy, in, addition, the, archduke, received, general, education, that, was, customary, at, the, time, including, mathematics, physics, history, geography, which, was, later, supplemented, by, law, and, political, science, various, forms, of, physical, education, completed, the, extensive, program, on, his, 13th, birthday, franz, joseph, was, appointed, colonel, inhaber, of, dragoon, regiment, no, 3, and, the, focus, of, his, training, shifted, to, imparting, basic, strategic, and, tactical, knowledge, from, that, point, onward, army, style, dictated, his, personal, fashion, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, normally, wore, the, uniform, of, a, military, officer, franz, joseph, was, soon, joined, by, three, younger, brothers, archduke, ferdinand, maximilian, born, 1832, the, future, emperor, maximilian, of, mexico, archduke, karl, ludwig, born, 1833, father, of, archduke, franz,

appointed, governor, of, bohemia, on, 6, april, 1848, but, never, took, up, the, post, sent, instead, to, the, front, in, italy, he, joined, field, marshal, radetzky, on, campaign, on, 29, april, receiving, his, baptism, of, fire, on, 5, may, at, santa, lucia, by, all, accounts, he, handled, his, first, military, experience, calmly, and, with, dignity, around, the, same, time, the, imperial, family, was, fleeing, revolutionary, vienna, for, the, calmer, setting, of, innsbruck, in, tyrol, called, back, from, italy, the, archduke, joined, the, rest, of, his, family, at, innsbruck, by, mid, june, it, was, here, that, franz, joseph, first, met, his, cousin, and, eventual, future, bride, elisabeth, then, a, girl, of, ten, but, apparently, the, meeting, made, little, impression, following, austria, s, victory, over, the, italians, at, custoza, in, late, july, 1848, the, court, felt, it, safe, to, return, to, vienna, and, franz, joseph, travelled, with, them, but, within, a, few, weeks, vienna, again, appeared, unsafe, and, in, september, the, court, left, once, more, this, time, for, olm, tz, in, moravia, by, now, alfred, i, prince, of, windisch, gr, tz, an, influential, military, commander, in, bohemia, was, determined, to, see, the, young, archduke, soon, put, on, the, throne, it, was, thought, that, a, new, ruler, would, not, be, bound, by, the, oaths, to, respect, constitutional, government, to, which, ferdinand, had, been, forced, to, agree, and, that, it, was, necessary, to, find, a, young, energetic, emperor, to, replace, the, kindly, but, mentally, unfit, ferdinand, by, the, abdication, of, his, uncle, ferdinand, and, the, renunciation, of, his, father, the, mild, mannered, franz, karl, franz, joseph, succeeded, as, emperor, of, austria, at, olm, tz, on, 2, december, 1848, at, this, time, he, first, became, known, by, his, second, as, well, as, his, first, christian, name, the, name, franz, joseph, was, chosen, to, bring, back, memories, of, the, new, emperor, s, great, granduncle, emperor, joseph, ii, holy, roman, emperor, from, 1765, to, 1790, remembered, as, a, modernising, reformer, under, the, guidance, of, the, new, prime, minister, prince, felix, of, schwarzenberg, the, new, emperor, at, first, pursued, a, cautious, course, granting, a, constitution, in, march, 1849, at, the, same, time, a, military, campaign, was, necessary, against, the, hungarians, who, had, rebelled, against, habsburg, central, authority, in, the, name, of, their, ancient, constitution, franz, joseph, was, also, almost, immediately, faced, with, a, renewal, of, the, fighting, in, italy, with, king, charles, albert, of, sardinia, taking, advantage, of, setbacks, in, hungary, to, resume, the, war, in, march, 1849, however, the, military, tide, began, to, turn, swiftly, in, favor, of, franz, joseph, and, the, austrian, whitecoats, almost, immediately, charles, albert, was, decisively, beaten, by, radetzky, at, novara, and, forced, to, sue, for, peace, as, well, as, to, renounce, his, throne, unlike, other, habsburg, ruled, areas, the, kingdom, of, hungary, had, an, old, historic, constitution, which, limited, the, power, of, the, crown, and, had, greatly, increased, the, authority, of, the, parliament, since, the, 13th, century, the, hungarian, reform, laws, april, laws, were, based, on, the, 12, points, that, established, the, fundaments, of, modern, civil, and, political, rights, economic, and, societal, reforms, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, the, crucial, turning, point, of, the, hungarian, events, were, the, april, laws, which, was, ratified, by, his, uncle, king, ferdinand, however, the, new, young, austrian, monarch, francis, joseph, arbitrarily, revoked, the, laws, without, any, legal, competence, the, monarchs, had, no, right, to, revoke, hungarian, parliamentary, laws, which, were, already, signed, this, unconstitutional, act, irreversibly, escalated, the, conflict, between, the, hungarian, parliament, and, francis, joseph, the, austrian, stadion, constitution, was, accepted, by, the, imperial, diet, of, austria, where, hungary, had, no, representation, and, which, traditionally, had, no, legislative, power, in, the, territory, of, kingdom, of, hungary, despite, this, it, also, tried, to, abolish, the, diet, of, hungary, which, existed, as, the, supreme, legislative, power, in, hungary, since, the, late, 12th, century, the, new, austrian, constitution, also, went, against, the, historical, constitution, of, hungary, and, even, tried, to, nullify, it, even, the, territorial, integrity, of, the, country, was, in, danger, on, 7, march, 1849, an, imperial, proclamation, was, issued, in, the, name, of, the, emperor, francis, joseph, according, to, the, new, proclamation, the, territory, of, kingdom, of, hungary, would, be, carved, up, and, administered, by, five, military, districts, while, the, principality, of, transylvania, would, be, reestablished, these, events, represented, a, clear, and, obvious, existential, threat, for, the, hungarian, state, the, new, constrained, stadion, constitution, of, austria, the, revocation, of, the, april, laws, and, the, austrian, military, campaign, against, kingdom, of, hungary, resulted, in, the, fall, of, the, pacifist, batthy, ny, government, which, sought, agreement, with, the, court, and, led, to, the, sudden, emergence, of, lajos, kossuth, s, followers, in, the, hungarian, parliament, who, demanded, the, full, independence, of, hungary, the, austrian, military, intervention, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, resulted, in, strong, anti, habsburg, sentiment, among, hungarians, thus, the, events, in, hungary, grew, into, a, war, for, total, independence, from, the, habsburg, dynasty, on, 7, december, 1848, the, diet, of, hungary, formally, refused, to, acknowledge, the, title, of, the, new, king, as, without, the, knowledge, and, consent, of, the, diet, no, one, could, sit, on, the, hungarian, throne, and, called, the, nation, to, arms, while, in, most, western, european, countries, like, france, and, the, united, kingdom, the, monarch, s, reign, began, immediately, upon, the, death, of, their, predecessor, in, hungary, the, coronation, was, indispensable, if, it, were, not, properly, executed, the, kingdom, remained, orphaned, even, during, the, long, personal, union, between, the, kingdom, of, hungary, and, other, habsburg, ruled, areas, the, habsburg, monarchs, had, to, be, crowned, as, king, of, hungary, in, order, to, promulgate, laws, there, or, exercise, royal, prerogatives, in, the, territory, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, from, a, legal, point, of, view, according, to, the, coronation, oath, a, crowned, hungarian, king, could, not, relinquish, the, hungarian, throne, during, his, life, if, the, king, was, alive, and, unable, to, do, his, duty, as, ruler, a, governor, or, regent, as, they, would, be, called, in, english, had, to, assume, the, royal, duties, constitutionally, franz, josef, s, uncle, ferdinand, was, still, the, legal, king, of, hungary, if, there, was, no, possibility, to, inherit, the, throne, automatically, due, to, the, death, of, the, predecessor, king, since, king, ferdinand, was, still, alive, but, the, monarch, wanted, to, relinquish, his, throne, and, appoint, another, king, before, his, death, technically, only, one, legal, solution, remained, the, parliament, had, the, power, to, dethrone, the, king, and, elect, a, new, king, due, to, the, legal, and, military, tensions, the, hungarian, parliament, did, not, grant, franz, joseph, that, favour, this, event, gave, to, the, revolt, an, excuse, of, legality, actually, from, this, time, until, the, collapse, of, the, revolution, lajos, kossuth, as, elected, regent, president, became, the, de, facto, and, de, jure, ruler, of, hungary, while, the, revolutions, in, the, austrian, territories, had, been, suppressed, by, 1849, in, hungary, the, situation, was, more, severe, and, austrian, defeat, seemed, imminent, sensing, a, need, to, secure, his, right, to, rule, franz, joseph, sought, help, from, russia, requesting, the, intervention, of, tsar, nicolas, i, in, order, to, prevent, the, hungarian, insurrection, developing, into, a, european, calamity, for, the, russian, military, support, franz, joseph, kissed, the, hand, of, the, tsar, in, warsaw, on, 21, may, 1849, tsar, nicholas, supported, franz, joseph, in, the, name, of, the, holy, alliance, and, sent, a, 200, 000, strong, army, with, 80, 000, auxiliary, forces, finally, the, joint, army, of, russian, and, austrian, forces, defeated, the, hungarian, forces, after, the, restoration, of, habsburg, power, hungary, was, placed, under, brutal, martial, law, with, order, now, restored, throughout, his, empire, franz, joseph, felt, free, to, renege, on, the, constitutional, concessions, he, had, made, especially, as, the, austrian, parliament, meeting, at, kremsier, had, behaved, in, the, young, emperor, s, eyes, abominably, the, 1849, constitution, was, suspended, and, a, policy, of, absolutist, centralism, was, established, guided, by, the, minister, of, the, interior, alexander, bach, on, 18, february, 1853, franz, joseph, survived, an, assassination, attempt, by, hungarian, nationalist, j, nos, lib, nyi, the, emperor, was, taking, a, stroll, with, one, of, his, officers, count, maximilian, karl, lamoral, o, donnell, on, a, city, bastion, when, lib, nyi, approached, him, he, immediately, struck, the, emperor, from, behind, with, a, knife, straight, at, the, neck, franz, joseph, almost, always, wore, a, uniform, which, had, a, high, collar, that, almost, completely, enclosed, the, neck, the, collars, of, uniforms, at, that, time, were, made, from, very, sturdy, material, precisely, to, counter, this, kind, of, attack, even, though, the, emperor, was, wounded, and, bleeding, the, collar, saved, his, life, count, o, donnell, struck, lib, nyi, down, with, his, sabre, o, donnell, hitherto, a, count, only, by, virtue, of, his, irish, nobility, was, made, a, count, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, reichsgraf, another, witness, who, happened, to, be, nearby, the, butcher, joseph, ettenreich, swiftly, overpowered, lib, nyi, for, his, deed, he, was, later, elevated, to, the, nobility, by, the, emperor, and, became, joseph, von, ettenreich, lib, nyi, was, subsequently, put, on, trial, and, condemned, to, death, for, attempted, regicide, he, was, executed, on, the, simmeringer, heide, after, this, unsuccessful, attack, the, emperor, s, brother, archduke, ferdinand, maximilian, called, upon, europe, s, royal, families, for, donations, to, construct, a, new, church, on, the, site, of, the, attack, the, church, was, to, be, a, votive, offering, for, the, survival, of, the, emperor, it, is, located, on, ringstra, e, in, the, district, of, alsergrund, close, to, the, university, of, vienna, and, is, known, as, the, votivkirche, the, survival, of, franz, joseph, was, also, commemorated, in, prague, by, erecting, a, new, statue, of, st, francis, of, assisi, the, patron, saint, of, the, emperor, on, charles, bridge, it, was, donated, by, count, franz, anton, von, kolowrat, liebsteinsky, the, first, minister, president, of, the, austrian, empire, the, next, few, years, saw, the, seeming, recovery, of, austria, s, position, on, the, international, scene, following, the, near, disasters, of, 1848, 1849, under, schwarzenberg, s, guidance, austria, was, able, to, stymie, prussian, scheming, to, create, a, new, german, federation, under, prussian, leadership, excluding, austria, after, schwarzenberg, s, premature, death, in, 1852, he, could, not, be, replaced, by, statesmen, of, equal, stature, and, the, emperor, himself, effectively, took, over, as, prime, minister, he, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, roman, catholic, rulers, in, europe, and, a, fierce, enemy, of, freemasonry, the, 1850s, witnessed, several, failures, of, austrian, external, policy, the, crimean, war, the, dissolution, of, its, alliance, with, russia, and, defeat, in, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, the, setbacks, continued, in, the, 1860s, with, defeat, in, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, which, resulted, in, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, of, 1867, the, hungarian, political, leaders, had, two, main, goals, during, the, negotiations, one, was, to, regain, the, traditional, status, both, legal, and, political, of, the, hungarian, state, which, was, lost, after, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, the, other, was, to, restore, the, series, of, reform, laws, of, the, revolutionary, parliament, of, 1848, which, were, based, on, the, 12, points, that, established, modern, civil, and, political, rights, economic, and, societal, reforms, in, hungary, the, compromise, partially, re, established, the, sovereignty, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, separate, from, and, no, longer, subject, to, the, austrian, empire, instead, it, was, regarded, as, an, equal, partner, with, austria, the, compromise, put, an, end, to, 18, years, of, absolutist, rule, and, military, dictatorship, which, had, been, introduced, by, francis, joseph, after, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, franz, joseph, was, crowned, king, of, hungary, on, 8, june, and, on, 28, july, he, promulgated, the, laws, that, officially, turned, the, habsburg, domains, into, the, dual, monarchy, of, austria, hungary, according, to, emperor, franz, joseph, there, were, three, of, us, who, made, the, agreement, de, k, andr, ssy, and, myself, political, difficulties, in, austria, mounted, continuously, through, the, late, 19th, century, and, into, the, 20th, century, however, franz, joseph, remained, immensely, respected, the, emperor, s, patriarchal, authority, held, the, empire, together, while, the, politicians, squabbled, among, themselves, following, the, accession, of, franz, joseph, to, the, throne, in, 1848, the, political, representatives, of, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, hoped, and, insisted, that, account, should, be, taken, of, their, historical, state, rights, in, the, upcoming, constitution, they, felt, the, position, of, bohemia, within, the, habsburg, monarchy, should, have, been, highlighted, by, a, coronation, of, the, new, ruler, to, the, king, of, bohemia, in, prague, the, last, coronation, took, place, in, 1836, however, before, the, 19th, century, the, habsburgs, had, ruled, bohemia, by, hereditary, right, and, a, separate, coronation, was, not, deemed, necessary, his, new, government, installed, the, system, of, neoabsolutism, in, austrian, internal, affairs, to, make, the, austrian, empire, a, unitary, centralised, and, bureaucratically, administered, state, when, franz, joseph, returned, to, constitutional, rule, after, the, debacles, in, italy, at, magenta, and, solferino, and, summoned, the, diets, of, his, lands, the, question, of, his, coronation, as, king, of, bohemia, again, returned, to, the, agenda, as, it, had, not, since, 1848, on, 14, april, 1861, emperor, franz, joseph, received, a, delegation, from, the, bohemian, diet, with, his, words, in, czech, i, will, have, myself, crowned, king, of, bohemia, in, prague, and, i, am, convinced, that, a, new, indissoluble, bond, of, trust, and, loyalty, between, my, throne, and, my, bohemian, kingdom, will, be, strengthened, by, this, holy, rite, in, contrast, to, his, predecessor, emperor, ferdinand, who, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, after, his, abdication, in, 1848, in, bohemia, and, especially, in, prague, franz, joseph, was, never, crowned, separately, as, king, of, bohemia, in, 1861, the, negotiations, failed, because, of, unsolved, constitutional, problems, however, in, 1866, a, visit, of, the, monarch, to, prague, following, defeat, at, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, was, a, huge, success, testified, by, the, considerable, numbers, of, new, photographs, taken, in, 1867, the, austro, hungarian, compromise, and, the, introduction, of, the, dual, monarchy, left, the, czechs, and, their, aristocracy, without, the, recognition, of, separate, bohemian, state, rights, for, which, they, had, hoped, bohemia, remained, part, of, the, austrian, crown, lands, in, bohemia, opposition, to, dualism, took, the, form, of, isolated, street, demonstrations, resolutions, from, district, representations, and, even, open, air, mass, protest, meetings, confined, to, the, biggest, cities, such, as, prague, the, czech, newspaper, n, rodn, listy, complained, that, the, czechs, had, not, yet, been, compensated, for, their, wartime, losses, and, sufferings, during, the, austro, prussian, war, and, had, just, seen, their, historic, state, rights, tossed, aside, and, their, land, subsumed, into, the, other, half, of, the, austro, hungarian, monarchy, commonly, called, cisleithania, the, czech, hopes, were, revived, again, in, 1870, 1871, in, an, imperial, rescript, of, 26, september, 1870, franz, joseph, referred, again, to, the, prestige, and, glory, of, the, bohemian, crown, and, to, his, intention, to, hold, a, coronation, under, minister, president, karl, hohenwart, in, 1871, the, government, of, cisleithania, negotiated, a, series, of, fundamental, articles, spelling, out, the, relationship, of, the, bohemian, crown, to, the, rest, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, on, 12, september, 1871, franz, joseph, announced, having, in, mind, the, constitutional, position, of, the, bohemian, crown, and, being, conscious, of, the, glory, and, power, which, that, crown, has, given, us, and, our, predecessors, we, gladly, recognise, the, rights, of, the, kingdom, and, are, prepared, to, renew, that, recognition, through, our, coronation, oath, for, the, planned, coronation, the, composer, bed, ich, smetana, had, written, the, opera, libu, e, but, the, ceremony, did, not, take, place, the, creation, of, the, german, empire, domestic, opposition, from, german, speaking, liberals, especially, german, bohemians, and, from, hungarians, doomed, the, fundamental, articles, hohenwart, resigned, and, nothing, changed, many, czech, people, were, waiting, for, political, changes, in, monarchy, including, tom, garrigue, masaryk, and, others, masaryk, served, in, the, reichsrat, upper, house, from, 1891, to, 1893, in, the, young, czech, party, and, again, from, 1907, to, 1914, in, the, realist, party, which, he, had, founded, in, 1900, but, he, did, not, campaign, for, the, independence, of, czechs, and, slovaks, from, austria, hungary, in, vienna, in, 1909, he, helped, hinko, hinkovi, s, defense, in, the, fabricated, trial, against, prominent, croats, and, serbs, members, of, the, serbo, croatian, coalition, such, as, frano, supilo, and, svetozar, pribi, evi, and, others, who, were, sentenced, to, more, than, 150, years, and, a, number, of, death, penalties, the, bohemian, question, would, remain, unresolved, for, the, entirety, of, franz, joseph, s, reign, the, main, foreign, policy, goal, of, franz, joseph, had, been, the, unification, of, germany, under, the, house, of, habsburg, this, was, justified, on, grounds, of, precedence, from, 1452, to, the, end, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, with, only, one, brief, period, of, interruption, under, the, house, of, wittelsbach, the, habsburgs, had, generally, held, the, german, crown, however, franz, joseph, s, desire, to, retain, the, non, german, territories, of, the, habsburg, austrian, empire, in, the, event, of, german, unification, proved, problematic, two, factions, quickly, developed, a, party, of, german, intellectuals, favouring, a, greater, germany, gro, deutschland, under, the, house, of, habsburg, the, other, favouring, a, lesser, germany, kleindeutschland, the, greater, germans, favoured, the, inclusion, of, austria, in, a, new, all, german, state, on, the, grounds, that, austria, had, always, been, a, part, of, germanic, empires, that, it, was, the, leading, power, of, the, german, confederation, and, that, it, would, be, absurd, to, exclude, eight, million, austrian, germans, from, an, all, german, nation, state, the, champions, of, a, lesser, germany, argued, against, the, inclusion, of, austria, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, a, multi, nation, state, not, a, german, one, and, that, its, inclusion, would, bring, millions, of, non, germans, into, the, german, nation, state, if, greater, germany, were, to, prevail, the, crown, would, necessarily, have, to, go, to, franz, joseph, who, had, no, desire, to, cede, it, in, the, first, place, to, anyone, else, on, the, other, hand, if, the, idea, of, a, smaller, germany, won, out, the, german, crown, could, of, course, not, possibly, go, to, the, emperor, of, austria, but, would, naturally, be, offered, to, the, head, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, german, state, outside, of, austria, the, king, of, prussia, the, contest, between, the, two, ideas, quickly, developed, into, a, contest, between, austria, and, prussia, after, prussia, decisively, won, the, seven, weeks, war, this, question, was, solved, austria, lost, no, territories, to, prussia, as, long, as, they, remained, out, of, german, affairs, in, 1873, two, years, after, the, unification, of, germany, franz, joseph, entered, into, the, league, of, three, emperors, dreikaiserbund, with, emperor, wilhelm, i, of, germany, and, emperor, alexander, ii, of, russia, who, was, succeeded, by, tsar, alexander, iii, in, 1881, the, league, had, been, designed, by, the, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, as, an, attempt, to, maintain, the, peace, of, europe, it, would, last, intermittently, until, 1887, in, 1903, franz, joseph, s, veto, of, jus, exclusivae, of, cardinal, mariano, rampolla, s, election, to, the, papacy, was, transmitted, to, the, papal, conclave, by, cardinal, jan, puzyna, de, kosielsko, it, was, the, last, use, of, such, a, veto, as, the, new, pope, pius, x, prohibited, future, uses, and, provided, for, excommunication, for, any, attempt, during, the, mid, 1870s, a, series, of, violent, rebellions, against, ottoman, rule, broke, out, in, the, balkans, and, the, turks, responded, with, equally, violent, and, oppressive, reprisals, tsar, alexander, ii, of, russia, wanting, to, intervene, against, the, ottomans, sought, and, obtained, an, agreement, with, austria, hungary, in, the, budapest, convention, of, 1877, the, two, powers, agreed, that, russia, would, annex, southern, bessarabia, and, austria, hungary, would, observe, a, benevolent, neutrality, toward, russia, in, the, pending, war, with, the, turks, as, compensation, for, this, support, russia, agreed, to, austria, hungary, s, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, a, scant, 15, months, later, the, russians, imposed, on, the, ottomans, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, which, reneged, on, the, budapest, accord, and, declared, that, bosnia, herzegovina, would, be, jointly, occupied, by, russian, and, austrian, troops, the, treaty, was, overturned, by, the, 1878, treaty, of, berlin, which, allowed, sole, austrian, occupation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, but, did, not, specify, a, final, disposition, of, the, provinces, that, omission, was, addressed, in, the, three, emperors, league, agreement, of, 1881, when, both, germany, and, russia, endorsed, austria, hungary, s, right, to, annex, bosnia, herzegovina, however, by, 1897, under, a, new, tsar, the, russian, imperial, government, had, again, withdrawn, its, support, for, austrian, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, the, russian, foreign, minister, count, mikhail, muravyov, stated, that, an, austrian, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, would, raise, an, extensive, question, requiring, special, scrutiny, in, 1908, the, russian, foreign, minister, alexander, izvolsky, offered, russian, support, for, the, third, time, for, the, annexation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, by, austria, hungary, in, exchange, for, austrian, support, for, the, opening, of, the, bosporus, strait, and, the, dardanelles, to, russian, warships, austria, s, foreign, minister, alois, von, aehrenthal, pursued, this, offer, vigorously, resulting, in, the, quid, pro, quo, understanding, with, izvolsky, reached, on, 16, september, 1908, at, the, buchlau, conference, however, izvolsky, made, this, agreement, with, aehrenthal, without, the, knowledge, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, or, his, government, in, st, petersburg, or, any, of, the, other, foreign, powers, including, britain, france, and, serbia, based, upon, the, assurances, of, the, buchlau, conference, and, the, treaties, that, preceded, it, franz, joseph, signed, the, proclamation, announcing, the, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, into, the, empire, on, 6, october, 1908, however, a, diplomatic, crisis, erupted, as, both, the, serbs, and, the, italians, demanded, compensation, for, the, annexation, which, the, austro, hungarian, government, refused, to, entertain, the, incident, was, not, resolved, until, the, revision, of, the, treaty, of, berlin, in, april, 1909, exacerbating, tensions, between, austria, hungary, and, the, serbs, on, 28, june, 1914, franz, joseph, s, nephew, and, heir, presumptive, archduke, franz, ferdinand, and, his, morganatic, wife, sophie, duchess, of, hohenberg, were, assassinated, by, gavrilo, princip, a, yugoslav, nationalist, of, serbian, ethnicity, during, a, visit, to, sarajevo, franz, joseph, learned, about, the, assassination, of, franz, ferdinand, from, his, adjutant, cavalry, general, eduard, von, paar, who, also, wrote, the, emperor, s, reaction, in, his, diary, one, has, not, to, defy, the, almighty, in, this, manner, a, superior, power, has, restored, that, order, which, i, unfortunately, was, unable, to, maintain, while, the, emperor, was, shaken, and, interrupted, his, holiday, to, return, to, vienna, he, soon, resumed, his, vacation, at, his, kaiservilla, at, bad, ischl, initial, decision, making, during, the, july, crisis, fell, to, count, leopold, berchtold, the, austrian, foreign, minister, count, franz, conrad, von, h, tzendorf, the, chief, of, staff, for, the, austro, hungarian, army, and, the, other, ministers, the, ultimate, resolution, of, deliberations, by, the, austro, hungarian, government, during, the, weeks, following, the, assassination, of, the, archduke, was, to, give, serbia, an, ultimatum, of, itemized, demands, with, which, it, was, virtually, certain, serbia, would, be, unable, or, unwilling, to, comply, thus, serving, as, a, legal, basis, for, war, a, week, after, delivery, of, the, austro, hungarian, ultimatum, to, serbia, on, 28, july, war, was, declared, within, weeks, the, germans, russians, french, and, british, had, all, entered, the, fray, which, eventually, became, known, as, world, war, i, on, 6, august, franz, joseph, signed, the, declaration, of, war, against, russia, franz, joseph, died, in, the, sch, nbrunn, palace, on, the, evening, of, 21, november, 1916, at, the, age, of, 86, his, death, was, a, result, of, developing, pneumonia, of, the, right, lung,

the, collapse, of, the, empire, following, its, defeat, at, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1918, he, is, buried, in, the, imperial, crypt, in, vienna, it, was, generally, felt, in, the, court, that, the, emperor, should, marry, and, produce, heirs, as, soon, as, possible, various, potential, brides, were, considered, including, princess, elisabeth, of, modena, princess, anna, of, prussia, and, princess, sidonia, of, saxony, although, in, public, life, franz, joseph, was, the, unquestioned, director, of, affairs, in, his, private, life, his, mother, still, wielded, crucial, influence, sophie, wanted, to, strengthen, the, relationship, between, the, houses, of, habsburg, and, wittelsbach, descending, from, the, latter, house, herself, and, hoped, to, match, franz, joseph, with, her, sister, ludovika, s, eldest, daughter, helene, n, n, who, was, four, years, the, emperor, s, junior, however, franz, joseph, fell, deeply, in, love, with, n, n, s, younger, sister, elisabeth, sisi, a, beautiful, girl, of, fifteen, and, insisted, on, marrying, her, instead, sophie, acquiesced, despite, her, misgivings, about, sisi, s, appropriateness, as, an, imperial, consort, and, the, young, couple, were, married, on, 24, april, 1854, in, st, augustine, s, church, vienna, their, marriage, would, eventually, prove, to, be, an, unhappy, one, though, franz, joseph, was, passionately, in, love, with, his, wife, the, feeling, was, not, mutual, elisabeth, never, truly, acclimatized, to, life, at, court, and, was, frequently, in, conflict, with, the, imperial, family, their, first, daughter, sophie, died, as, an, infant, and, their, only, son, rudolf, died, by, suicide, in, 1889, in, the, infamous, mayerling, incident, in, 1885, franz, joseph, met, katharina, schratt, a, leading, actress, of, the, vienna, stage, and, she, became, his, friend, and, confidante, this, relationship, lasted, the, rest, of, his, life, and, was, to, a, certain, degree, tolerated, by, elisabeth, franz, joseph, built, villa, schratt, in, bad, ischl, for, her, and, also, provided, her, with, a, small, palace, in, vienna, though, their, relationship, lasted, for, thirty, four, years, it, remained, platonic, the, empress, was, an, inveterate, traveller, horsewoman, and, fashion, maven, who, was, rarely, seen, in, vienna, sisi, was, obsessed, about, preserving, her, beauty, carrying, out, many, bizarre, routines, and, strenuous, exercise, and, as, a, result, suffered, from, ill, health, she, was, stabbed, to, death, by, an, italian, anarchist, in, 1898, while, on, a, visit, to, geneva, a, few, days, after, the, funeral, robert, of, parma, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, tirso, de, olaz, bal, that, it, was, pitiful, to, look, at, the, emperor, he, showed, a, great, deal, of, energy, in, his, immense, pain, but, at, times, one, could, see, all, the, immensity, of, his, grief, franz, joseph, never, fully, recovered, from, the, loss, according, to, the, future, empress, zita, of, bourbon, parma, he, told, his, relatives, you, ll, never, know, how, important, she, was, to, me, or, according, to, some, sources, you, will, never, know, how, much, i, loved, this, woman, archduke, franz, ferdinand, became, heir, presumptive, thronfolger, to, the, throne, of, austria, hungary, in, 1896, after, the, deaths, of, his, cousin, rudolf, in, 1889, and, his, father, karl, ludwig, in, 1896, the, relationship, between, him, and, franz, joseph, had, always, been, a, fairly, contentious, one, which, was, further, exacerbated, when, franz, ferdinand, announced, his, desire, to, marry, countess, sophie, chotek, the, emperor, would, not, even, consider, giving, his, blessing, to, the, union, as, sophie, was, merely, of, noble, rank, not, dynastic, rank, although, the, emperor, received, letters, from, members, of, the, imperial, family, throughout, the, fall, and, winter, of, 1899, beseeching, him, to, relent, franz, joseph, stood, his, ground, he, finally, gave, his, consent, in, 1900, however, the, marriage, was, to, be, morganatic, and, any, children, of, the, marriage, would, be, ineligible, to, succeed, to, the, throne, the, couple, were, married, on, 1, july, 1900, at, reichstadt, the, emperor, did, not, attend, the, wedding, nor, did, any, of, the, archdukes, after, that, the, two, men, disliked, and, mistrusted, each, other, his, interactions, with, franz, ferdinand, were, strained, the, emperor, s, personal, attendant, recollected, in, his, memoirs, that, thunder, and, lightning, always, raged, when, they, had, their, discussions, following, the, assassination, of, franz, ferdinand, and, sophie, in, 1914, franz, joseph, s, daughter, marie, valerie, noted, that, her, father, expressed, his, greater, confidence, in,
