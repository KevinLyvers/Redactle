nicolas, l, onard, sadi, carnot, french, 1, june, 1796, 24, august, 1832, was, a, french, military, engineer, and, physicist, a, graduate, of, the, cole, polytechnique, carnot, served, as, an, officer, in, the, engineering, arm, le, g, nie, of, the, french, army, he, also, pursued, scientific, studies, and, in, june, 1824, published, an, essay, titled, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, in, that, book, which, would, be, his, only, publication, carnot, developed, the, first, successful, theory, of, the, maximum, efficiency, of, heat, engines, carnot, s, scientific, work, attracted, little, attention, during, his, lifetime, but, in, 1834, it, became, the, object, of, a, detailed, commentary, and, explication, by, another, french, engineer, mile, clapeyron, clapeyron, s, commentary, in, turn, attracted, the, attention, of, william, thomson, later, known, as, lord, kelvin, and, rudolf, clausius, thomson, used, carnot, s, analysis, to, develop, an, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, while, clausius, used, it, to, define, the, concept, of, entropy, thus, formalizing, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, sadi, carnot, was, the, son, of, lazare, carnot, an, eminent, mathematician, engineer, and, commander, of, the, french, revolutionary, army, and, later, of, the, napoleonic, army, some, of, the, difficulties, that, sadi, faced, in, his, own, career, might, have, been, connected, to, the, persecution, of, his, family, by, the, restored, bourbon, monarchy, after, the, fall, of, napoleon, in, 1815, sadi, carnot, died, in, relative, obscurity, at, the, age, of, 36, but, today, he, is, often, characterized, as, the, father, of, thermodynamics, sadi, carnot, was, born, in, paris, on, the, 1st, of, june, 1796, at, the, petit, luxembourg, palace, where, his, father, lazare, resided, as, one, of, the, five, members, of, the, directory, the, highest, governing, body, of, the, french, first, republic, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, thermidorian, reaction, his, mother, sophie, n, e, dupont, 1764, 1813, came, from, a, wealthy, family, based, in, saint, omer, sadi, was, named, by, his, father, lazare, after, the, 13th, century, persian, poet, sadi, of, shiraz, an, older, brother, also, named, sadi, had, been, born, in, 1794, but, died, in, infancy, the, following, year, sadi, is, the, only, given, name, that, appears, in, the, second, born, s, civil, birth, certificate, dated, 14, prairial, year, iv, in, the, french, republican, calendar, on, 11, july, 1796, the, child, was, baptized, in, the, catholic, church, of, saint, louis, d, antin, as, nicolas, l, onard, dupont, the, principal, witness, at, that, baptism, was, his, maternal, grandfather, jacques, antoine, l, onard, dupont, the, father, is, wrongly, identified, in, the, baptismal, record, as, jacques, l, onard, joseph, auguste, dupont, who, was, in, fact, the, child, s, maternal, uncle, following, the, biographical, notice, published, long, after, his, death, by, his, brother, hippolyte, most, sources, now, give, his, full, name, as, nicolas, l, onard, sadi, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, ever, used, any, name, other, than, sadi, sadi, had, a, younger, brother, hippolyte, carnot, who, was, born, in, 1801, in, saint, omer, and, who, would, later, become, a, prominent, politician, hippolyte, s, eldest, son, marie, fran, ois, sadi, carnot, served, as, president, of, france, from, 1887, to, 1894, another, of, hippolyte, s, sons, was, the, chemist, mining, engineer, and, politician, adolphe, carnot, sadi, himself, would, remain, a, bachelor, and, left, no, descendants, the, young, sadi, was, educated, first, at, home, by, his, father, and, later, at, the, lyc, e, charlemagne, in, paris, where, he, prepared, for, the, examinations, required, to, enter, the, cole, polytechnique, which, his, father, had, helped, to, establish, in, 1811, at, the, age, of, 16, the, minimum, allowed, sadi, carnot, became, a, cadet, of, the, cole, polytechnique, where, his, classmates, included, the, future, mathematician, michel, chasles, among, his, professors, were, andr, marie, amp, re, sim, on, denis, poisson, fran, ois, arago, and, gaspard, gustave, coriolis, thus, the, school, had, become, renowned, for, its, instruction, in, mathematics, and, physics, during, the, battle, of, paris, in, march, 1814, carnot, chasles, and, other, cadets, of, the, cole, polytechnique, participated, in, the, defense, of, vincennes, this, appears, to, have, been, carnot, s, only, experience, of, battle, carnot, graduated, in, 1814, and, was, admitted, at, the, cole, d, application, de, l, artillerie, et, du, g, nie, school, of, applied, artillery, and, military, engineering, in, metz, where, he, completed, a, two, year, course, sadi, then, became, an, officer, in, the, french, army, s, corps, of, engineers, carnot, s, father, lazare, served, as, napoleon, s, minister, of, the, interior, during, the, hundred, days, and, after, napoleon, s, final, defeat, in, 1815, lazare, was, forced, into, exile, in, the, german, city, of, magdeburg, sadi, s, position, in, the, army, under, the, restored, bourbon, monarchy, of, king, louis, xviii, became, increasingly, difficult, lazare, never, returned, to, france, dying, in, magdeburg, in, 1823, sadi, became, a, captain, in, the, g, nie, and, was, posted, to, various, locations, where, he, inspected, fortifications, tracked, plans, and, wrote, many, reports, however, it, appeared, that, his, recommendations, were, ignored, and, that, his, career, was, stagnating, on, 15, september, 1818, at, the, age, of, 22, he, took, a, six, month, leave, to, prepare, for, the, entrance, examination, to, the, newly, formed, general, staff, in, paris, carnot, passed, the, exam, and, joined, the, general, staff, in, january, of, 1819, with, the, lower, rank, of, lieutenant, he, remained, on, call, for, military, duty, but, from, then, on, he, dedicated, most, of, his, attention, to, private, intellectual, pursuits, and, received, only, two, thirds, pay, in, paris, carnot, befriended, nicolas, cl, ment, and, charles, bernard, desormes, and, attended, lectures, on, physics, and, chemistry, at, the, sorbonne, and, the, coll, ge, de, france, he, also, attended, the, conservatoire, national, des, arts, et, m, tiers, where, he, followed, the, lectures, on, chemistry, by, cl, ment, and, those, on, economics, by, jean, baptiste, say, carnot, became, interested, in, understanding, the, limits, to, improving, the, performance, of, steam, engines, which, led, him, to, the, investigations, that, became, his, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, published, at, his, own, expense, in, june, 1824, carnot, was, finally, promoted, to, his, former, rank, of, captain, in, september, of, 1827, but, the, following, april, he, quit, the, army, having, completed, only, fifteen, months, of, active, service, and, without, right, to, a, pension, in, a, directory, of, alumni, of, the, cole, polytechnique, published, by, ambroise, fourcy, in, 1828, carnot, is, listed, as, maker, of, steam, engines, this, and, some, other, indications, suggest, that, carnot, may, have, been, involved, in, a, practical, scheme, for, the, improvement, of, steam, engines, but, no, patents, or, other, concrete, evidences, of, that, work, have, emerged, carnot, was, interested, in, political, economy, his, political, orientation, was, liberal, but, he, seems, to, have, preferred, the, more, interventionist, doctrines, of, jean, de, sismondi, to, the, laissez, faire, policies, advocated, by, classical, liberal, economists, like, say, and, david, ricardo, out, of, carnot, s, private, writings, on, economics, only, some, fragmentary, notes, survive, carnot, initially, welcomed, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, which, ended, the, bourbonic, regime, under, charles, x, and, established, a, new, constitutional, monarchy, under, citizen, king, louis, philippe, according, to, his, brother, hippolyte, there, was, some, discussion, among, leaders, of, the, new, regime, of, incorporating, sadi, to, the, chamber, of, peers, as, he, could, be, considered, to, have, inherited, the, imperial, title, of, count, carnot, that, napoleon, had, bestowed, on, his, father, lazare, in, 1815, nothing, came, of, this, however, perhaps, because, sadi, s, republican, convictions, prevented, him, from, accepting, a, hereditary, distinction, according, to, recollections, published, long, after, sadi, s, death, by, his, brother, hippolyte, sadi, was, an, avid, reader, of, blaise, pascal, moli, re, and, jean, de, la, fontaine, hippolyte, recalled, that, sadi, was, a, philosophical, theist, who, believed, in, divine, causality, but, not, in, divine, punishment, carnot, wrote, in, his, private, papers, that, what, to, an, ignorant, man, is, chance, cannot, be, chance, to, one, better, instructed, he, was, critical, of, established, religion, but, spoke, in, favor, of, the, belief, in, an, all, powerful, being, who, loves, us, and, watches, over, us, hippolyte, also, described, his, brother, as, a, talented, violin, player, interested, principally, in, the, music, of, jean, baptiste, lully, and, giovanni, battista, viotti, who, also, cultivated, gymnastics, fencing, swimming, dancing, and, skating, according, to, historian, of, science, james, f, challey, although, sensitive, and, perceptive, carnot, appeared, extremely, introverted, even, aloof, to, all, but, a, few, close, friends, this, may, help, explain, why, carnot, s, work, failed, to, make, any, significant, impression, within, either, the, scientific, or, the, engineering, community, during, his, lifetime, in, the, summer, of, 1832, carnot, apparently, suffered, from, a, severe, bout, of, scarlet, fever, on, 3, august, he, was, interned, in, a, private, sanatorium, run, by, psychiatrist, jean, tienne, esquirol, and, located, in, ivry, just, south, of, paris, according, to, the, hospital, record, he, was, cured, from, mania, but, then, died, of, cholera, on, 24, august, carnot, was, buried, in, the, old, cemetery, of, ivry, close, to, what, is, now, the, mairie, d, ivry, station, sadi, carnot, s, contribution, to, the, development, of, thermodynamics, is, contained, in, his, only, published, work, a, short, book, titled, r, flexions, sur, la, puissance, motrice, du, feu, et, sur, les, machines, propres, d, velopper, cette, puissance, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, and, on, machines, fitted, to, develop, that, power, published, in, paris, in, june, of, 1824, by, bachelier, with, carnot, himself, paying, for, the, printing, of, the, 600, copies, the, work, attracted, little, attention, during, his, lifetime, and, virtually, disappeared, from, booksellers, and, libraries, an, article, published, in, 1834, two, years, after, carnot, s, death, and, ten, years, after, the, publication, of, his, book, by, the, engineer, and, fellow, polytechnicien, mile, clapeyron, finally, succeeded, in, calling, attention, to, carnot, s, work, which, some, years, later, was, used, by, lord, kelvin, and, rudolf, clausius, to, define, the, concepts, of, absolute, temperature, entropy, and, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, thomas, newcomen, invented, the, first, practical, piston, operated, steam, engine, in, 1712, some, 50, years, after, that, james, watt, made, his, celebrated, improvements, which, were, responsible, for, greatly, increasing, the, usefulness, of, steam, engines, when, carnot, became, interested, in, the, subject, in, the, 1820s, steam, engines, were, in, increasingly, wide, application, in, industry, and, their, economic, importance, was, widely, recognized, compound, engines, engines, with, more, than, one, stage, of, expansion, had, already, been, invented, and, there, was, even, a, crude, internal, combustion, engine, known, as, the, pyr, olophore, and, built, by, the, brothers, claude, and, nic, phore, ni, pce, with, which, carnot, was, familiar, and, which, he, described, in, some, detail, in, his, book, that, practical, work, on, steam, engines, and, the, intuitive, understanding, among, engineers, of, some, of, the, principles, underlying, their, operation, co, existed, however, with, an, almost, complete, lack, of, a, scientific, understanding, of, the, physical, phenomena, associated, with, heat, the, principle, of, conservation, of, energy, had, not, yet, been, clearly, articulated, and, the, ideas, surrounding, it, were, fragmentary, and, controversial, carnot, himself, accepted, the, view, prevalent, in, france, and, associated, with, the, work, of, antoine, lavoisier, that, heat, is, a, weightless, and, invisible, fluid, called, caloric, which, may, be, liberated, by, chemical, reactions, and, which, flows, from, bodies, at, higher, temperature, to, bodies, at, lower, temperature, in, his, book, carnot, sought, to, basic, questions, is, there, a, limit, to, the, work, that, can, be, generated, from, a, given, heat, source, and, can, the, performance, of, an, engine, be, improved, by, replacing, steam, with, a, different, working, fluid, engineers, in, carnot, s, time, had, tried, using, highly, pressurized, steam, and, other, fluids, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, engines, in, these, early, stages, of, engine, development, the, efficiency, of, a, typical, engine, the, useful, work, it, was, able, to, do, when, a, given, quantity, of, fuel, was, burned, was, only, about, 5, 7, carnot, s, book, was, only, 118, pages, long, and, covered, a, wide, range, of, topics, about, heat, engines, in, what, carnot, must, have, intended, to, be, a, form, accessible, to, a, wide, public, he, made, minimal, use, of, mathematics, which, he, confined, to, elementary, algebra, and, arithmetic, except, in, some, footnotes, carnot, discussed, the, relative, merits, of, air, and, steam, as, working, fluids, the, merits, of, various, aspects, of, steam, engine, design, and, even, included, some, ideas, of, his, own, regarding, possible, practical, improvements, however, the, central, part, of, the, book, was, an, abstract, treatment, of, an, idealized, engine, the, carnot, cycle, with, which, the, author, sought, to, clarify, the, fundamental, principles, that, govern, all, heat, engines, independently, of, the, details, of, their, design, or, operation, this, resulted, in, an, idealized, thermodynamic, system, upon, which, exact, calculations, could, be, made, and, avoided, the, complications, introduced, by, many, of, the, crude, features, of, the, contemporary, steam, engines, carnot, considered, an, idealized, process, in, which, heat, from, a, thermal, reservoir, at, a, high, temperature, flows, very, slowly, and, thus, reversibly, into, the, gas, contained, in, a, cylinder, enclosed, by, a, movable, piston, this, gives, an, isothermal, expansion, of, the, gas, that, pushes, out, the, piston, and, can, be, used, to, perform, useful, work, this, does, not, yet, constitute, an, engine, because, the, piston, must, be, returned, to, its, original, position, in, order, for, the, machine, to, run, cyclically, carnot, then, proposed, reducing, the, temperature, of, the, gas, by, an, adiabatic, expansion, during, which, the, cylinder, is, thermally, isolated, so, as, to, prevent, heat, from, entering, or, leaving, the, gas, once, the, temperature, of, the, gas, has, reached, the, same, value, as, that, of, the, colder, reservoir, the, cylinder, is, put, into, thermal, contact, with, that, reservoir, and, the, gas, undergoes, an, isothermal, compression, during, which, it, very, slowly, and, thus, reversibly, rejects, heat, into, the, reservoir, to, close, the, cycle, the, temperature, of, the, gas, in, the, cylinder, can, be, raised, by, adiabatic, compression, until, it, reaches, a, value, equal, to, the, temperature, of, the, hotter, reservoir, this, succession, of, isothermal, expansion, adiabatic, expansion, isothermal, compression, and, adiabatic, compression, can, then, be, repeated, as, many, times, as, desired, generating, a, net, amount, of, work, each, time, at, the, expense, of, a, transfer, of, heat, from, the, hotter, reservoir, to, the, colder, reservoir, as, carnot, explained, such, a, cycle, constitutes, the, most, efficient, heat, engine, possible, given, the, temperatures, of, the, two, reservoirs, not, only, because, of, the, trivial, absence, of, friction, heat, leakage, or, other, incidental, wasteful, processes, the, main, reason, is, that, it, involves, no, conduction, of, heat, between, parts, of, the, engine, at, different, temperatures, carnot, understood, that, the, conduction, of, heat, between, bodies, at, different, temperatures, is, a, wasteful, and, irreversible, process, which, must, be, minimized, if, the, heat, engine, is, to, achieve, its, maximum, efficiency, because, carnot, s, cycle, is, reversible, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, refrigerator, if, an, external, agent, supplies, the, needed, mechanical, work, to, move, the, piston, the, sequence, of, transformations, of, the, gas, will, absorb, heat, from, the, colder, reservoir, and, reject, it, into, the, hotter, reservoir, carnot, argued, that, no, engine, operating, between, reservoirs, at, two, given, temperatures, could, deliver, more, work, than, his, reversible, cycle, otherwise, the, more, efficient, engine, could, run, carnot, s, cycle, in, reverse, as, a, refrigerator, thus, returning, all, of, the, caloric, from, the, colder, back, to, the, hotter, reservoir, with, some, positive, amount, of, work, left, over, to, perform, a, further, useful, task, carnot, assumed, that, such, a, process, in, which, no, net, caloric, was, consumed, while, positive, work, could, be, done, forever, would, be, a, perpetual, motion, and, therefore, forbidden, by, the, laws, of, physics, this, argument, led, carnot, to, conclude, that, the, motive, power, of, heat, is, independent, of, the, agents, employed, to, realize, it, its, quantity, is, fixed, solely, by, the, temperatures, of, the, bodies, between, which, is, effected, finally, the, transfer, of, caloric, carnot, understood, that, his, idealized, engine, would, have, the, maximum, possible, thermal, efficiency, given, the, temperatures, of, the, two, reservoirs, but, he, did, not, calculate, the, value, of, that, efficiency, because, of, the, ambiguities, associated, with, the, various, temperature, scales, used, by, scientists, at, the, time, in, the, fall, of, caloric, motive, power, undoubtedly, increases, with, the, difference, of, temperature, between, the, warm, and, cold, bodies, but, we, do, not, know, whether, it, is, proportional, to, this, difference, later, in, his, book, carnot, considered, a, heat, engine, operating, very, close, to, the, boiling, point, of, water, alcohol, or, some, other, working, fluid, the, transition, between, the, liquid, and, vapor, phases, involves, a, sudden, change, in, density, and, therefore, in, the, volume, occupied, by, the, fluid, while, a, latent, heat, is, needed, to, transform, some, amount, of, the, fluid, from, one, phase, to, the, other, by, requiring, that, the, volume, change, associated, with, such, a, transition, not, be, available, to, construct, what, he, characterized, as, a, perpetual, motion, device, carnot, arrived, at, what, would, later, be, formalized, mathematically, as, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, in, the, feynman, lectures, on, physics, theoretical, physicist, richard, feynman, stresses, that, this, result, is, due, to, carnot, and, gives, a, modernized, version, of, carnot, s, original, argument, in, 1849, james, thomson, the, elder, brother, of, lord, kelvin, applied, carnot, s, reasoning, to, the, freezing, of, water, i, e, the, phase, transition, between, liquid, water, and, ice, and, concluded, that, it, predicted, that, the, melting, point, of, ice, must, decrease, if, an, external, pressure, is, applied, to, it, an, effect, that, no, one, had, ever, proposed, or, studied, before, james, thomson, s, prediction, was, later, confirmed, experimentally, by, his, brother, the, future, lord, kelvin, who, found, that, the, data, agreed, fully, with, carnot, s, analysis, kelvin, later, said, of, carnot, s, argument, that, nothing, in, the, whole, range, of, natural, philosophy, is, more, remarkable, than, the, establishment, of, general, laws, by, such, a, process, of, reasoning, carnot, published, his, book, in, june, 1824, and, it, was, presented, at, that, time, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, by, pierre, simon, girard, girard, also, published, a, praiseful, but, rather, broad, review, of, the, book, in, the, revue, encyclop, dique, but, after, that, the, book, seems, to, have, fallen, into, obscurity, it, was, only, after, the, publication, of, an, extensive, commentary, and, explication, of, carnot, s, work, by, mile, clapeyron, in, 1834, that, engineers, and, scientists, began, to, take, an, interest, in, carnot, s, contributions, clapeyron, s, article, was, translated, into, english, in, 1837, and, into, german, in, 1843, kelvin, read, clapeyron, s, paper, in, 1845, while, visiting, the, paris, laboratory, of, henri, regnault, but, it, was, only, at, the, end, of, 1848, that, kelvin, was, able, to, read, carnot, s, original, work, in, a, copy, provided, to, him, by, lewis, gordon, independently, of, kelvin, the, german, physicist, rudolf, clausius, also, based, his, study, of, thermodynamics, on, carnot, s, work, clausius, modified, carnot, s, arguments, to, make, them, compatible, with, the, mechanical, equivalence, of, heat, this, then, led, clausius, to, define, the, concept, of, entropy, and, to, formulate, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, carnot, s, text, was, re, printed, in, 1871, in, the, annales, scientifiques, of, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, and, again, by, gauthier, villars, in, 1878, with, the, collaboration, of, hippolyte, carnot, in, 1890, an, english, translation, of, the, book, was, published, by, r, h, thurston, that, version, has, been, reprinted, in, recent, decades, by, dover, in, 1892, lord, kelvin, referred, to, carnot, s, essay, as, an, epoch, making, gift, to, science, carnot, published, his, book, in, the, heyday, of, steam, engines, his, theory, explained, the, advantage, of, engines, that, use, superheated, steam, since, they, absorb, heat, from, a, reservoir, at, a, higher, temperature, carnot, s, work, did, not, however, lead, to, any, immediate, practical, improvements, of, steam, technologies, it, was, only, towards, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, that, engineers, deliberately, implemented, carnot, s, key, concepts, that, the, efficiency, of, a, heat, is, improved, by, increasing, the, temperature, at, which, heat, is, drawn, and, by, minimizing, the, flow, of, heat, between, bodies, at, different, temperatures, in, particular, rudolf, diesel, used, carnot, s, analysis, in, his, design, of, the, diesel, engine, in, which, heat, is, injected, at, a, much, higher, temperature, than, in, the, older, steam, engines, and, in, which, the, heat, from, the, combustion, of, the, fuel, goes, primarily, into, expanding, the, air, in, the, cylinder, rather, than, into, increasing, its, temperature, sadi, s, younger, brother, hippolyte, obscured, the, details, of, sadi, s, death, and, destroyed, most, of, his, personal, papers, much, later, in, 1878, when, carnot, s, essay, had, come, to, be, widely, recognized, as, a, founding, document, of, the, new, science, of, thermodynamics, hippolyte, sponsored, the, publication, of, a, new, edition, that, included, a, biographical, notice, on, sadi, carnot, written, by, hippolyte, along, with, some, excerpts, from, unpublished, notes, by, sadi, on, mathematics, physics, and, other, subjects, these, are, the, only, sources, of, information, on, many, aspects, of, sadi, s, life, and, thought, in, the, opinion, of, historian, of, science, arthur, birembaut, the, smokescreen, that, hippolyte, drew, over, his, brother, s, life, makes, it, impossible, now, to, reconstruct, the, details, of, sadi, s, career, his, relationship, with, other, physicists, and, engineers, and, the, circumstances, of, his, death, among, the, private, notes, published, by, hippolyte, in, 1878, there, is, material, indicating, that, sadi, carnot, had, by, the, spring, of, 1832, rejected, the, caloric, theory, and, accepted, the, equivalence, of, heat, and, work, in, his, notes, carnot, wrote, that, heat, is, simply, motive, power, or, rather, motion, that, has, changed, form, it, is, a, movement, among, the, particles, of, bodies, wherever, there, is, destruction, of, motive, power, there, is, at, the, same, time, production, of, heat, in, quantity, exactly, proportional, to, the, quantity, of, motive, power, destroyed, reciprocally, wherever, there, is, destruction, of, heat, there, is, production, of, motive, power, in, those, same, notes, carnot, estimated, that, 1, kilo, calorie, is, the, equivalent, of, 370, kg,
