aitken, hired, paine, as, the, magazine, s, editor, one, month, later, under, paine, s, leadership, the, magazine, s, readership, rapidly, expanded, achieving, a, greater, circulation, in, the, colonies, than, any, american, magazine, up, until, that, point, while, aitken, had, conceived, of, the, magazine, as, nonpolitical, paine, brought, a, strong, political, perspective, to, its, content, writing, in, its, first, issue, that, every, heart, and, hand, seem, to, be, engaged, in, the, interesting, struggle, for, american, liberty, paine, wrote, in, the, pennsylvania, magazine, that, such, a, publication, should, become, a, nursery, of, genius, for, a, nation, that, had, now, outgrown, the, state, of, infancy, exercising, and, educating, american, minds, and, shaping, american, morality, on, march, 8, 1775, the, pennsylvania, magazine, published, an, unsigned, abolitionist, essay, titled, african, slavery, in, america, the, essay, is, often, attributed, to, paine, on, the, basis, of, a, letter, by, benjamin, rush, recalling, paine, s, claim, of, authorship, to, the, essay, the, essay, attacked, slavery, as, an, execrable, commerce, and, outrage, against, humanity, and, justice, consciously, appealing, to, a, broader, and, more, working, class, audience, paine, also, used, the, magazine, to, discuss, worker, rights, to, production, this, shift, in, the, conceptualization, of, politics, has, been, described, as, a, part, of, the, modernization, of, political, consciousness, and, the, mobilization, of, ever, greater, sections, of, society, into, political, life, paine, has, a, claim, to, the, title, the, father, of, the, american, revolution, which, rests, on, his, pamphlets, especially, common, sense, which, crystallized, sentiment, for, independence, in, 1776, it, was, published, in, philadelphia, on, january, 10, 1776, and, signed, anonymously, by, an, englishman, it, was, an, immediate, success, with, paine, estimating, it, sold, 100, 000, copies, in, three, months, to, the, two, million, residents, of, the, 13, colonies, during, the, course, of, the, american, revolution, one, biographer, estimated, a, total, of, about, 500, 000, copies, were, sold, including, unauthorized, editions, however, some, historians, dispute, these, numbers, paine, s, original, title, for, the, pamphlet, was, plain, truth, but, paine, s, friend, pro, independence, advocate, benjamin, rush, suggested, common, sense, instead, finding, a, printer, who, was, daring, enough, to, commit, his, print, shop, to, the, printing, of, common, sense, was, not, easy, at, the, advice, of, rush, paine, commissioned, robert, bell, to, print, his, work, the, pamphlet, came, into, circulation, in, january, 1776, after, the, revolution, had, started, it, was, passed, around, and, often, read, aloud, in, taverns, contributing, significantly, to, spreading, the, idea, of, republicanism, bolstering, enthusiasm, for, separation, from, britain, and, encouraging, recruitment, for, the, continental, army, paine, provided, a, new, and, convincing, argument, for, independence, by, advocating, a, complete, break, with, history, common, sense, is, oriented, to, the, future, in, a, way, that, compels, the, reader, to, make, an, immediate, choice, it, offers, a, solution, for, americans, disgusted, with, and, alarmed, at, the, threat, of, tyranny, paine, s, attack, on, monarchy, in, common, sense, is, essentially, an, attack, on, george, iii, whereas, colonial, resentments, were, originally, directed, primarily, against, the, king, s, ministers, and, parliament, paine, laid, the, responsibility, firmly, at, the, king, s, door, common, sense, was, the, most, widely, read, pamphlet, of, the, american, revolution, it, was, a, clarion, call, for, unity, against, the, corrupt, british, court, so, as, to, realize, america, s, providential, role, in, providing, an, asylum, for, liberty, written, in, a, direct, and, lively, style, it, denounced, the, decaying, despotisms, of, europe, and, pilloried, hereditary, monarchy, as, an, absurdity, at, a, time, when, many, still, hoped, for, reconciliation, with, britain, common, sense, demonstrated, to, many, the, inevitability, of, separation, paine, was, not, on, the, whole, expressing, original, ideas, in, common, sense, but, rather, employing, rhetoric, as, a, means, to, arouse, resentment, of, the, crown, to, achieve, these, ends, he, pioneered, a, style, of, political, writing, suited, to, the, democratic, society, he, envisioned, with, common, sense, serving, as, a, primary, example, part, of, paine, s, work, was, to, render, complex, ideas, intelligible, to, average, readers, of, the, day, with, clear, concise, writing, unlike, the, formal, learned, style, favored, by, many, of, paine, s, contemporaries, scholars, have, put, forward, various, explanations, to, account, for, its, success, including, the, historic, moment, paine, s, easy, to, understand, style, his, democratic, ethos, and, his, use, of, psychology, and, ideology, common, sense, was, immensely, popular, in, disseminating, to, a, very, wide, audience, ideas, that, were, already, in, common, use, among, the, elite, who, comprised, congress, and, the, leadership, cadre, of, the, emerging, nation, who, rarely, cited, paine, s, arguments, in, their, public, calls, for, independence, the, pamphlet, probably, had, little, direct, influence, on, the, continental, congress, decision, to, issue, a, declaration, of, independence, since, that, body, was, more, concerned, with, how, declaring, independence, would, affect, the, war, effort, one, distinctive, idea, in, common, sense, is, paine, s, beliefs, regarding, the, peaceful, nature, of, republics, his, views, were, an, early, and, strong, conception, of, what, scholars, would, come, to, call, the, democratic, peace, theory, loyalists, vigorously, attacked, common, sense, one, attack, titled, plain, truth, 1776, by, marylander, james, chalmers, said, paine, was, a, political, quack, and, warned, that, without, monarchy, the, government, would, degenerate, into, democracy, even, some, american, revolutionaries, objected, to, common, sense, late, in, life, john, adams, called, it, a, crapulous, mass, adams, disagreed, with, the, type, of, radical, democracy, promoted, by, paine, that, men, who, did, not, own, property, should, still, be, allowed, to, vote, and, hold, public, office, and, published, thoughts, on, government, in, 1776, to, advocate, a, more, conservative, approach, to, republicanism, sophia, rosenfeld, argues, that, paine, was, highly, innovative, in, his, use, of, the, commonplace, notion, of, common, sense, he, synthesized, various, philosophical, and, political, uses, of, the, term, in, a, way, that, permanently, impacted, american, political, thought, he, used, two, ideas, from, scottish, common, sense, realism, that, ordinary, people, can, indeed, make, sound, judgments, on, major, political, issues, and, that, there, exists, a, body, of, popular, wisdom, that, is, readily, apparent, to, anyone, paine, also, used, a, notion, of, common, sense, favored, by, philosophes, in, the, continental, enlightenment, they, held, that, common, sense, could, refute, the, claims, of, traditional, institutions, thus, paine, used, common, sense, as, a, weapon, to, de, legitimize, the, monarchy, and, overturn, prevailing, conventional, wisdom, rosenfeld, concludes, that, the, phenomenal, appeal, of, his, pamphlet, resulted, from, his, synthesis, of, popular, and, elite, elements, in, the, independence, movement, according, to, historian, robert, middlekauff, common, sense, became, immensely, popular, mainly, because, paine, appealed, to, widespread, convictions, monarchy, he, said, was, preposterous, and, it, had, a, heathenish, origin, it, was, an, institution, of, the, devil, paine, pointed, to, the, old, testament, where, almost, all, kings, had, seduced, the, israelites, to, worship, idols, instead, of, god, paine, also, denounced, aristocracy, which, together, with, monarchy, were, two, ancient, tyrannies, they, violated, the, laws, of, nature, human, reason, and, the, universal, order, of, things, which, began, with, god, that, was, middlekauff, says, exactly, what, most, americans, wanted, to, hear, he, calls, the, revolutionary, generation, the, children, of, the, twice, born, because, in, their, childhood, they, had, experienced, the, great, awakening, which, for, the, first, time, had, tied, americans, together, transcending, denominational, and, ethnic, boundaries, and, giving, them, a, sense, of, patriotism, while, there, is, no, historical, record, of, paine, s, involvement, in, drafting, the, declaration, of, independence, some, scholars, of, early, american, history, have, suspected, his, involvement, as, noted, by, the, thomas, paine, national, historical, association, multiple, authors, have, hypothesized, and, written, on, the, subject, including, moody, 1872, van, der, weyde, 1911, lewis, 1947, and, more, recently, smith, rickards, 2007, in, 2018, the, thomas, paine, national, historical, association, introduced, an, early, draft, of, the, declaration, that, contained, evidence, of, paine, s, involvement, based, on, an, inscription, of, t, p, on, the, back, of, the, document, during, the, early, deliberations, of, the, committee, of, five, members, chosen, by, congress, to, draft, the, declaration, of, independence, john, adams, made, a, hastily, written, manuscript, copy, of, the, original, draft, of, the, declaration, of, independence, on, june, 24, 1776, known, as, the, sherman, copy, adams, made, this, copy, shortly, before, preparing, another, neater, fair, copy, that, is, held, in, the, adams, family, papers, collection, at, the, massachusetts, historical, society, the, sherman, copy, of, the, declaration, of, independence, is, one, of, several, working, drafts, of, the, declaration, made, for, roger, sherman, s, review, and, approval, before, the, committee, of, five, submitted, a, finalized, draft, to, congress, the, sherman, copy, of, the, declaration, of, independence, contains, an, inscription, on, the, back, of, the, document, that, states, a, beginning, perhaps, original, with, jefferson, copied, from, original, with, t, p, s, permission, according, to, the, thomas, paine, national, historical, association, the, individual, referenced, as, t, p, in, the, inscription, appears, to, be, thomas, paine, the, degree, to, which, paine, was, involved, in, formulating, the, text, of, the, declaration, is, unclear, as, the, original, draft, referenced, in, the, sherman, copy, inscription, is, presumed, lost, or, destroyed, however, john, adams, request, for, permission, of, t, p, to, copy, the, original, draft, may, suggest, that, paine, had, a, role, either, assisting, jefferson, with, organizing, ideas, within, the, declaration, or, contributing, to, the, text, of, the, original, draft, itself, in, late, 1776, paine, published, the, american, crisis, pamphlet, series, to, inspire, the, americans, in, their, battles, against, the, british, army, he, juxtaposed, the, conflict, between, the, good, american, devoted, to, civic, virtue, and, the, selfish, provincial, man, to, inspire, his, soldiers, general, george, washington, had, the, american, crisis, first, crisis, pamphlet, read, aloud, to, them, it, begins, these, are, the, times, that, try, men, s, souls, the, summer, soldier, and, the, sunshine, patriot, will, in, this, crisis, shrink, from, the, service, of, their, country, but, he, that, stands, it, now, deserves, the, love, and, thanks, of, man, and, woman, tyranny, like, hell, is, not, easily, conquered, yet, we, have, this, consolation, with, us, that, the, harder, the, conflict, the, more, glorious, the, triumph, what, we, obtain, too, cheap, we, esteem, too, lightly, it, is, dearness, only, that, gives, every, thing, its, value, heaven, knows, how, to, put, a, proper, price, upon, its, goods, and, it, would, be, strange, indeed, if, so, celestial, an, article, as, freedom, should, not, be, highly, rated, in, 1777, paine, became, secretary, of, the, congressional, committee, on, foreign, affairs, the, following, year, he, alluded, to, secret, negotiation, underway, with, france, in, his, pamphlets, his, enemies, denounced, his, indiscretions, there, was, scandal, together, with, paine, s, conflict, with, robert, morris, and, silas, deane, it, led, to, paine, s, expulsion, from, the, committee, in, 1779, however, in, 1781, he, accompanied, john, laurens, on, his, mission, to, france, eventually, after, much, pleading, from, paine, new, york, state, recognized, his, political, services, by, presenting, him, with, an, estate, at, new, rochelle, new, york, and, paine, received, money, from, pennsylvania, and, from, congress, at, washington, s, suggestion, during, the, revolutionary, war, paine, served, as, an, aide, de, camp, to, the, important, general, nathanael, greene, in, what, may, have, been, an, error, and, perhaps, even, contributed, to, his, resignation, as, the, secretary, to, the, committee, of, foreign, affairs, paine, was, openly, critical, of, silas, deane, an, american, diplomat, who, had, been, appointed, in, march, 1776, by, the, congress, to, travel, to, france, in, secret, deane, s, goal, was, to, influence, the, french, government, to, finance, the, colonists, in, their, fight, for, independence, paine, largely, saw, deane, as, a, war, profiteer, who, had, little, respect, for, principle, having, been, under, the, employ, of, robert, morris, one, of, the, primary, financiers, of, the, american, revolution, and, working, with, pierre, beaumarchais, a, french, royal, agent, sent, to, the, colonies, by, king, louis, to, investigate, the, anglo, american, conflict, paine, uncovered, the, financial, connection, between, morris, who, was, superintendent, for, finance, of, the, continental, congress, and, deane, wealthy, men, such, as, robert, morris, john, jay, and, powerful, merchant, bankers, were, leaders, of, the, continental, congress, and, defended, holding, public, positions, while, at, the, same, time, profiting, off, their, own, personal, financial, dealings, with, governments, amongst, paine, s, criticisms, he, had, written, in, the, pennsylvania, packet, that, france, had, prefaced, alliance, by, an, early, and, generous, friendship, referring, to, aid, that, had, been, provided, to, american, colonies, prior, to, the, recognition, of, the, franco, american, treaties, this, was, alleged, to, be, effectively, an, embarrassment, to, france, which, potentially, could, have, jeopardized, the, alliance, john, jay, the, president, of, the, congress, who, had, been, a, fervent, supporter, of, deane, immediately, spoke, out, against, paine, s, comments, the, controversy, eventually, became, public, and, paine, was, then, denounced, as, unpatriotic, for, criticizing, an, american, revolutionary, he, was, even, physically, assaulted, twice, in, the, street, by, deane, supporters, this, much, added, stress, took, a, large, toll, on, paine, who, was, generally, of, a, sensitive, character, and, he, resigned, as, secretary, to, the, committee, of, foreign, affairs, in, 1779, paine, left, the, committee, without, even, having, enough, money, to, buy, food, for, himself, much, later, when, paine, returned, from, his, mission, to, france, deane, s, corruption, had, become, more, widely, acknowledged, many, including, robert, morris, apologized, to, paine, and, paine, s, reputation, in, philadelphia, was, restored, in, 1780, paine, published, a, pamphlet, entitled, public, good, in, which, he, made, the, case, that, territories, west, of, the, 13, colonies, that, had, been, part, of, the, british, empire, belonged, after, the, declaration, of, independence, to, the, american, government, and, did, not, belong, to, any, of, the, 13, states, or, to, any, individual, speculators, a, royal, charter, of, 1609, had, granted, to, the, virginia, company, land, stretching, to, the, pacific, ocean, a, small, group, of, wealthy, virginia, land, speculators, including, the, washington, lee, and, randolph, families, had, taken, advantage, of, this, royal, charter, to, survey, and, to, claim, title, to, huge, swaths, of, land, including, much, land, west, of, the, 13, colonies, in, public, good, paine, argued, that, these, lands, belonged, to, the, american, government, as, represented, by, the, continental, congress, this, angered, many, of, paine, s, wealthy, virginia, friends, including, richard, henry, lee, of, the, powerful, lee, family, who, had, been, paine, s, closest, ally, in, congress, george, washington, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, all, of, whom, had, claims, to, huge, wild, tracts, that, paine, was, advocating, should, be, government, owned, the, view, that, paine, had, advocated, eventually, prevailed, when, the, northwest, ordinance, of, 1787, was, passed, the, animosity, paine, felt, as, a, result, of, the, publication, of, public, good, fueled, his, decision, to, embark, with, lieutenant, colonel, john, laurens, on, a, mission, to, travel, to, paris, to, obtain, funding, for, the, american, war, effort, paine, accompanied, col, john, laurens, to, france, and, is, credited, with, initiating, the, mission, it, landed, in, france, in, march, 1781, and, returned, to, america, in, august, with, 2, 5, million, livres, in, silver, as, part, of, a, present, of, 6, million, and, a, loan, of, 10, million, the, meetings, with, the, french, king, were, most, likely, conducted, in, the, company, and, under, the, influence, of, benjamin, franklin, upon, returning, to, the, united, states, with, this, highly, welcomed, cargo, paine, and, probably, col, laurens, positively, objected, that, general, washington, should, propose, that, congress, remunerate, him, for, his, services, for, fear, of, setting, a, bad, precedent, and, an, improper, mode, paine, made, influential, acquaintances, in, paris, and, helped, organize, the, bank, of, north, america, to, raise, money, to, supply, the, army, in, 1785, he, was, given, 3, 000, by, the, u, s, congress, in, recognition, of, his, service, to, the, nation, henry, laurens, father, of, col, john, laurens, had, been, the, ambassador, to, the, netherlands, but, he, was, captured, by, the, british, on, his, return, trip, there, when, he, was, later, exchanged, for, the, prisoner, lord, cornwallis, in, late, 1781, paine, proceeded, to, the, netherlands, to, continue, the, loan, negotiations, there, remains, some, question, as, to, the, relationship, of, henry, laurens, and, paine, to, robert, morris, as, the, superintendent, of, finance, and, his, business, associate, thomas, willing, who, became, the, first, president, of, the, bank, of, north, america, in, january, 1782, they, had, accused, morris, of, profiteering, in, 1779, and, willing, had, voted, against, the, declaration, of, independence, although, morris, did, much, to, restore, his, reputation, in, 1780, and, 1781, the, credit, for, obtaining, these, critical, loans, to, organize, the, bank, of, north, america, for, approval, by, congress, in, december, 1781, should, go, to, henry, or, john, laurens, and, paine, more, than, to, morris, paine, bought, his, only, house, in, 1783, on, the, corner, of, farnsworth, avenue, and, church, streets, in, bordentown, city, new, jersey, and, he, lived, in, it, periodically, until, his, death, in, 1809, this, is, the, only, place, in, the, world, where, paine, purchased, real, estate, in, 1785, paine, was, elected, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1787, a, bridge, of, paine, s, design, was, built, across, the, schuylkill, river, at, philadelphia, at, this, time, his, work, on, single, arch, iron, bridges, led, him, back, to, paris, france, because, paine, had, few, friends, when, arriving, in, france, aside, from, lafayette, and, jefferson, he, continued, to, correspond, heavily, with, benjamin, franklin, a, long, time, friend, and, mentor, franklin, provided, letters, of, introduction, for, paine, to, use, to, gain, associates, and, contacts, in, france, later, that, year, paine, returned, to, london, from, paris, he, then, released, a, pamphlet, on, august, 20, called, prospects, on, the, rubicon, or, an, investigation, into, the, causes, and, consequences, of, the, politics, to, be, agitated, at, the, meeting, of, parliament, tensions, between, england, and, france, were, increasing, and, this, pamphlet, urged, the, british, ministry, to, reconsider, the, consequences, of, war, with, france, paine, sought, to, turn, the, public, opinion, against, the, war, to, create, better, relations, between, the, countries, avoid, the, taxes, of, war, upon, the, citizens, and, not, engage, in, a, war, he, believed, would, ruin, both, nations, back, in, london, by, 1787, paine, would, become,

copies, paine, set, out, to, refute, it, in, his, rights, of, man, 1791, he, wrote, it, not, as, a, quick, pamphlet, but, as, a, long, abstract, political, tract, of, 90, 000, words, which, tore, apart, monarchies, and, traditional, social, institutions, on, january, 31, 1791, he, gave, the, manuscript, to, publisher, joseph, johnson, a, visit, by, government, agents, dissuaded, johnson, so, paine, gave, the, book, to, publisher, j, s, jordan, then, went, to, paris, on, william, blake, s, advice, he, charged, three, good, friends, william, godwin, thomas, brand, hollis, and, thomas, holcroft, with, handling, publication, details, the, book, appeared, on, march, 13, 1791, and, sold, nearly, a, million, copies, it, was, eagerly, read, by, reformers, protestant, dissenters,

reduced, in, price, to, ensure, unprecedented, circulation, it, was, sensational, in, its, impact, and, gave, birth, to, reform, societies, an, indictment, for, seditious, libel, followed, for, both, publisher, and, author, while, government, agents, followed, paine, and, instigated, mobs, hate, meetings, and, burnings, in, effigy, a, fierce, pamphlet, war, also, resulted, in, which, paine, was, defended, and, assailed, in, dozens, of, works, the, authorities, aimed, with, ultimate, success, to, force, paine, out, of, great, britain, he, was, then, tried, in, absentia, and, found, guilty, but, he, was, beyond, the, reach, of, british, law, the, french, translation, of, rights, of, man, part, ii, was, published, in, april, 1792, the, translator, fran, ois, lanthenas, eliminated, the, dedication, to, lafayette, as, he, believed, paine, thought, too, highly, of, lafayette, who, was, seen, as, a, royalist, sympathizer, at, the, time, in, summer, of, 1792, he, answered, the, sedition, and, libel, charges, thus, if, to, expose, the, fraud, and, imposition, of, monarchy, to, promote, universal, peace, civilization, and, commerce, and, to, break, the, chains, of, political,

the, french, revolution, and, was, granted, honorary, french, citizenship, alongside, prominent, contemporaries, such, as, alexander, hamilton, george, washington, benjamin, franklin, and, others, paine, s, honorary, citizenship, was, in, recognition, of, the, publishing, of, his, rights, of, man, part, ii, and, the, sensation, it, created, within, france, despite, his, inability, to, speak, french, he, was, elected, to, the, national, convention, representing, the, district, of, pas, de, calais, several, weeks, after, his, election, to, the, national, convention, paine, was, selected, as, one, of, nine, deputies, to, be, part, of, the, convention, s, constitutional, committee, charged, to, draft, a, suitable, constitution, for, the, french, republic, he, subsequently, participated, in, the, constitutional, committee, in, drafting, the, girondin, constitutional, project, he, voted, for, the, french, republic, but, argued, against, the, execution, of, louis, xvi, referred, to, as, louis, capet, following, his, deposition, saying, the, monarch, should, instead, be, exiled, to, the, united, states, firstly, because, of, the, way, royalist, france, had, come, to, the, aid, of, the, american, revolution, and, secondly, because, of, a, moral, objection, to, capital, punishment, in, general, and, to, revenge, killings, in, particular, paine, s, speech, in, defense, of, louis, xvi, was, interrupted, by, jean, paul, marat, who, claimed, that, as, a, quaker, paine, s, religious, beliefs, ran, counter, to, inflicting, capital, punishment, and, thus, he, should, be, ineligible, to, vote, marat, interrupted, a, second, time, stating, that, the, translator, was, deceiving, the, convention, by, distorting, the, meanings, of, paine, s, words, prompting, paine, to, provide, a, copy, of, the, speech, as, proof, that, he, was, being, correctly, translated, paine, wrote, the, second, part, of, rights, of, man, on, a, desk, in, thomas, clio, rickman, s, house, with, whom, he, was, staying, in, 1792, before, he, fled, to, france, this, desk, is, currently, on, display, in, the, people, s, history, museum, in, manchester, regarded, as, an, ally, of, the, girondins, he, was, seen, with, increasing, disfavor, by, the, montagnards, who, were, now, in, power, paine, was, under, scrutiny, by, the, authorities, also, because, he, was, a, personal, adversary, of, gouverneur, morris, who, was, the, american, ambassador, in, france, and, a, friend, of, george, washington, the, revolutionary, government, both, the, committee, of, public, safety, and, the, committee, of, general, security, sought, to, gain, the, favor, of, the, american, ambassador, not, wanting, to, risk, the, alliance, with, the, united, states, therefore, they, were, more, inclined, to, focus, on, paine, paine, was, arrested, in, france, on, december, 28, 1793, following, the, orders, of, vadier, joel, barlow, was, unsuccessful, in, securing, paine, s, release, by, circulating, a, petition,

release, to, the, convention, yet, president, marc, guillaume, alexis, vadier, of, the, committee, of, general, security, refused, to, acknowledge, paine, s, american, citizenship, stating, he, was, an, englishman, and, therefore, a, citizen, of, a, country, at, war, with, france, paine, protested, and, claimed, that, he, was, a, citizen, of, the, u, s, however, ambassador, morris, did, not, press, his, claim, and, paine, later, wrote, that, morris, had, connived, at, his, imprisonment, paine, narrowly, escaped, execution, a, chalk, mark, was, supposed, to, be, left, by, the, jailer, on, the, door, of, a, cell, to, denote, that, the, prisoner, inside, was, due, to, be, removed, for, execution, in, paine, s, case, the, mark, had, accidentally, been, made, on, the, inside, of, his, door, rather, than, the, outside, because, the, door, of, paine, s, cell, had, been, left, open, when, the, jailer, was, making, his, rounds, that, day, since, paine, had, been, receiving, official, visitors, but, for, this, quirk, of, fate, paine, would, have, been, executed, the, following, morning, he, kept, his, head, and, survived, the, few, vital, days, needed, to, be, spared, by, the, fall, of, robespierre, on, 9, thermidor, july, 27, 1794, paine, was, released, in, november, 1794, largely, because, of, the, work, of, the, new, american, ambassador, to, france, james, monroe, who, successfully, argued, the, case, for, paine, s, u, s, citizenship, in, july, 1795, he, was, re, admitted, into, the, convention, as, were, other, surviving, girondins, paine, was, one, of, only, three, d, put, s, to, oppose, the, adoption, of, the, new, 1795, constitution, because, it, eliminated, universal, suffrage, which, had, been, proclaimed, at, least, for, men, by, the, montagnard,

after, the, same, design, as, his, schuylkill, river, bridge, in, philadelphia, and, it, became, the, prototype, for, many, subsequent, voussoir, arches, made, in, iron, and, steel, in, addition, to, receiving, a, british, patent, for, the, single, span, iron, bridge, paine, developed, a, smokeless, candle, and, worked, with, inventor, john, fitch, in, developing, steam, engines, in, 1797, paine,

paine, stayed, on, with, him, helping, bonneville, with, the, burden, of, translating, the, covenant, sea, the, same, year, paine, purportedly, had, a, meeting, with, napoleon, bonaparte, napoleon, claimed, he, slept, with, a, copy, of, rights, of, man, les, droits, de, l, homme, in, french, under, his, pillow, and, went, so, far, as, to, say, to, paine, that, a, statue, of, gold, should, be, erected, to, you, in, every, city, in, the, universe, paine, discussed, with, napoleon, how, best, to, invade, england, in, december, 1797, he, had, written, two, essays, one, of, which, was, pointedly, named, observations, on, the, construction, and, operation, of, navies, with, a, plan, for, an, invasion, of, england, and, the, final, overthrow, of, the, english, government, in, which, he, promoted, the, idea, to, finance, 1, 000, gunboats, to, carry, a, french, invading, army, across, the, english, channel, in, 1804, paine, returned, to, the, subject, writing, to, the, people, of, england, on, the, invasion, of, england, advocating, the, idea, however, upon, noting, napoleon, s, progress, towards, dictatorship, he, condemned, him, as, the, completest, charlatan, that, ever, existed, upset, that, president, washington, a, friend, since, the, revolutionary, war, did, nothing, during, paine, s, imprisonment, in, france, paine, believed, washington, had, betrayed, him, and, conspired, with, robespierre, while, staying, with, monroe, paine, planned, to, send, washington, a, letter, of, grievance, on, the, president, s, birthday, monroe, stopped, the, letter, from, being, sent, and, after, paine, s, criticism, of, the, jay, treaty, which, was, supported, by, washington, monroe, suggested, that, paine, live, elsewhere, paine, then, sent, a, stinging, letter, to, washington, in, which, he, described, him, as, an, incompetent, commander, and, a, vain, and, ungrateful, person, having, received, no, response, paine, contacted, his, longtime, publisher, benjamin, bache, the, jeffersonian, democrat, to, publish, his, letter, to, george, washington, of, 1796, in, which, he, derided, washington, s, reputation, by, describing, him, as, a, treacherous, man, who, was, unworthy, of, his, fame, as, a, military, and, political, hero, paine, wrote, that, the, world, will, be, puzzled, to, decide, whether, you, are, an, apostate, or, an, impostor, whether, you, have, abandoned, good, principles, or, whether, you, ever, had, any, he, declared, that, without, france, s, aid, washington, could, not, have, succeeded, in, the, american, revolution, and, had, but, little, share, in, the, glory, of, the, final, event, he, also, commented, on, washington, s, character, saying, that, washington, had, no, sympathetic, feelings, and, was, a, hypocrite, paine, remained, in, france, until, 1802, returning, to, the, united, states, only, at, president, jefferson, s, invitation, paine, also, paid, for, the, passage, for, bonneville, s, wife, marguerite,

awakening, and, a, time, of, great, political, partisanship, the, age, of, reason, gave, ample, excuse, for, the, religiously, devout, to, dislike, him, while, the, federalists, attacked, him, for, his, ideas, of, government, stated, in, common, sense, for, his, association, with, the, french, revolution, and, for, his, friendship, with, president, jefferson, also, still, fresh, in, the, minds, of, the, public, was, his, letter, to, washington, published, six, years, before, his, return, this, was, compounded, when, his, right, to, vote, was, denied, in, new, rochelle, on, the, grounds, that, gouverneur, morris, did, not, recognize, him, as, an, american, and, washington, had, not, aided, him, brazier, took, care, of, paine, at, the, end, of, his, life, and, buried, him, after, his, death, in, his, will, paine, left, the, bulk, of, his, estate, to, her, including, 100, acres, 40, 5, ha, of, his, farm, so, she, could, maintain, and, educate, benjamin, and, his, brother, thomas,

intention, to, give, paine, a, heroic, reburial, on, his, native, soil, but, this, never, came, to, pass, the, bones, were, still, among, cobbett, s, effects, when, he, died, over, fifteen, years, later, but, were, later, lost, there, is, no, confirmed, story, about, what, happened, to, them, after, that, although, various, people, have, claimed, throughout, the, years, to, own, parts, of,

religion, the, opinions, i, have, advanced, are, the, effect, of, the, most, clear, and, long, established, conviction, that, the, bible, and, the, testament, are, impositions, upon, the, world, that,

j, kaye, wrote, that, through, paine, through, his, pamphlets, and, catchphrases, such, as, the, sun, never, shined, on, a, cause, of, greater, worth, we, have, it, in, our, power, to, begin, the,
