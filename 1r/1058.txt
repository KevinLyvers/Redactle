wars, completed, by, 51, bc, which, greatly, extended, roman, territory, during, this, time, he, both, invaded, britain, and, built, a, bridge, across, the, river, rhine, these, achievements, and, the, support, of, his, veteran, army, threatened, to, eclipse, the, standing, of, pompey, who, had, realigned, himself, with, the, senate, after, the, death, of, crassus, in, 53, bc, with, the, gallic, wars, concluded, the, senate, ordered, caesar, to, step, down, from, his, military, command, and, return, to, rome, in, 49, bc, caesar, openly, defied, the, senate, s, authority, by, crossing, the, rubicon, and, marching, towards, rome, at, the, head, of, an, army, this, began, caesar, s, civil, war, which, he, won, leaving, him, in, a, position, of, near, unchallenged, power, and,

great, nephew, and, adopted, heir, octavian, later, known, as, augustus, rose, to, sole, power, after, defeating, his, opponents, in, the, last, civil, war, of, the, roman, republic, octavian, set, about, solidifying, his, power, and, the, era, of, the, roman, empire, began, caesar, was, an, accomplished, author, and, historian, as, well, as, a, statesman, much, of, his, life, is, known, from, his, own, accounts, of, his, military, campaigns, other, contemporary, sources, include, the, letters, and, speeches, of, cicero, and, the, historical, writings, of, sallust, later, biographies, of, caesar, by, suetonius, and, plutarch, are, also, important, sources, caesar, is, considered, by, many, historians, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, military, commanders, in, history, his, cognomen, was, subsequently, adopted, as, a, synonym, for, emperor, the, title, caesar, was, used, throughout, the, roman, empire, giving, rise, to, modern, descendants, such, as, kaiser, and, tsar, he, has, frequently, appeared, in, literary, and, artistic, works, gaius, julius, caesar, was, born, into, a, patrician, family, the, gens, julia, on, 12, july, 100, bc, the, family, claimed, to, have, immigrated, to, rome, from, alba, longa, during, the, seventh, century, bc, after, the, third, king, of, rome, tullus, hostilius, took, and, destroyed, their, city, the, family, also, claimed, descent, from, julus, the, son, of, aeneas, and, founder, of, alba, longa, given, that, aeneas, was, a, son, of, venus, this, made, the, clan, divine, this, genealogy, had, not, yet, taken, its, final, form, by, the, first, century, but, the, clan, s, claimed, descent, from, venus, was, well, established, in, public, consciousness, there, is, no, evidence, that, caesar, himself, was, born, by, caesarian, section, such, operations, entailed, the, death, of, the, mother, but, caesar, s, mother, lived, for, decades, after, his, birth, and, no, ancient, sources, record, any, difficulty, with, the, birth, despite, their, ancient, pedigree, the, julii, caesares, were, not, especially, politically, influential, during, the, middle, republic, the, first, person, known, to, have, had, the, cognomen, caesar, was, a, praetor, in, 208, bc, during, the, second, punic, war, the, family, s, first, consul, was, in, 157, bc, though, their, political, fortunes, had, recovered, in, the, early, first, century, producing, two, consuls, in, 91, and, 90, bc, caesar, s, homonymous, father, was, moderately, successful, politically, he, married, aurelia, a, member, of, the, politically, influential, aurelii, cottae, producing, along, with, caesar, two, daughters, buoyed, by, his, own, marriage, and, his, sister, s, marriage, the, dictator, s, aunt, with, the, extremely, influential, gaius, marius, he, also, served, on, the, saturninian, land, commission, in, 103, bc, and, was, elected, praetor, some, time, between, 92, and, 85, bc, he, served, as, proconsular, governor, of, asia, for, two, years, likely, 91, 90, bc, caesar, s, father, did, not, seek, a, consulship, during, the, domination, of, lucius, cornelius, cinna, and, instead, chose, retirement, during, cinna, s, dominance, caesar, was, named, as, flamen, dialis, a, priest, of, jupiter, which, led, to, his, marriage, to, cinna, s, daughter, cornelia, the, religious, taboos, of, the, priesthood, would, have, forced, caesar, to, forgo, a, political, career, the, appointment, one, of, the, highest, non, political, honours, indicates, that, there, were, few, expectations, of, a, major, career, for, caesar, in, early, 84, bc, caesar, s, father, died, suddenly, after, sulla, s, victory, in, the, civil, war, 82, bc, cinna, s, acta, were, annulled, sulla, consequently, ordered, caesar, to, abdicate, and, divorce, cinna, s, daughter, caesar, refused, implicitly, questioning, the, legitimacy, of, sulla, s, annulment, sulla, may, have, put, caesar, on, the, proscription, lists, though, scholars, are, mixed, caesar, then, went, into, hiding, before, his, relatives, and, contacts, among, the, vestal, virgins, were, able, to, intercede, on, his, behalf, they, then, reached, a, compromise, where, caesar, would, resign, his, priesthood, but, keep, his, wife, and, chattels, sulla, s, alleged, remark, he, saw, in, many, mariuses, is, apocryphal, caesar, then, left, italy, to, serve, in, the, staff, of, the, governor, of, asia, marcus, minucius, thermus, while, there, he, travelled, to, bithynia, to, collect, naval, reinforcements, and, stayed, some, time, as, a, guest, of, the, king, nicomedes, iv, though, later, invective, connected, caesar, to, a, homosexual, relation, with, the, monarch, he, then, served, at, the, siege, of, mytilene, where, he, won, the, civic, crown, for, saving, the, life, of, a, fellow, citizen, in, battle, the, privileges, of, the, crown, the, senate, was, supposed, to, stand, on, a, holder, s, entrance, and, holders, were, permitted, to, wear, the, crown, at, public, occasions, whetted, caesar, s, appetite, for, honours, after, the, capture, of, mytilene, caesar, transferred, to, the, staff, of, publius, servilius, vatia, in, cilicia, before, learning, of, sulla, s, death, in, 78, bc, and, returning, home, immediately, he, was, alleged, to, have, wanted, to, join, in, on, the, consul, lepidus, revolt, that, year, but, this, is, likely, literary, embellishment, of, caesar, s, desire, for, tyranny, from, a, young, age, afterward, caesar, attacked, some, of, the, sullan, aristocracy, in, the, courts, but, was, unsuccessful, in, his, attempted, prosecution, of, gnaeus, cornelius, dolabella, in, 77, bc, who, had, recently, returned, from, a, proconsulship, in, macedonia, going, after, a, less, well, connected, senator, he, was, successful, the, next, year, in, prosecuting, gaius, antonius, hybrida, later, consul, in, 63, bc, for, profiteering, from, the, proscriptions, but, was, forestalled, when, a, tribune, interceded, on, antonius, behalf, after, these, oratorical, attempts, caesar, left, rome, for, rhodes, seeking, the, tutelage, of, the, rhetorician, apollonius, molon, while, travelling, he, was, intercepted, and, ransomed, by, pirates, in, a, story, that, was, later, much, embellished, according, to, plutarch, and, suetonius, he, was, freed, after, paying, a, ransom, of, fifty, talents, and, responded, by, returning, with, a, fleet, to, capture, and, execute, the, pirates, the, recorded, sum, for, the, ransom, is, literary, embellishment, and, it, is, more, likely, that, the, pirates, were, sold, into, slavery, per, velleius, paterculus, his, studies, were, interrupted, by, the, outbreak, of, the, third, mithridatic, war, over, the, winter, of, 75, and, 74, bc, caesar, is, alleged, to, have, gone, around, collecting, troops, in, the, province, at, the, locals, expense, and, leading, them, successfully, against, mithridates, forces, while, absent, from, rome, in, 73, bc, caesar, was, co, opted, into, the, pontifices, in, place, of, his, deceased, relative, gaius, aurelius, cotta, the, promotion, marked, him, as, a, well, accepted, member, of, the, aristocracy, with, great, future, prospects, in, his, political, career, caesar, decided, to, return, shortly, thereafter, and, on, his, return, was, elected, one, of, the, military, tribunes, for, 71, bc, there, is, no, evidence, that, caesar, served, in, war, even, though, the, war, on, spartacus, was, on, going, during, his, term, he, did, however, agitate, for, the, removal, of, sulla, s, disabilities, on, the, plebeian, tribunate, and, for, those, who, supported, lepidus, revolt, to, be, pardoned, these, advocacies, were, common, and, uncontroversial, the, next, year, 70, bc, pompey, and, crassus, were, consuls, and, brought, legislation, restoring, the, plebeian, tribunate, s, rights, one, of, the, tribunes, with, caesar, supporting, then, brought, legislation, pardoning, the, lepidan, exiles, for, his, quaestorship, in, 69, bc, caesar, was, allotted, to, serve, under, gaius, antistius, vetus, in, hispania, ulterior, his, election, also, gave, him, a, lifetime, seat, in, the, senate, however, before, he, left, his, aunt, julia, the, widow, of, marius, died, and, soon, afterwards, his, wife, cornelia, died, shortly, after, bearing, his, only, legitimate, child, julia, he, gave, eulogies, for, both, at, public, funerals, during, julia, s, funeral, caesar, displayed, the, images, of, his, aunt, s, husband, marius, whose, memory, had, been, suppressed, after, sulla, s, victory, in, the, civil, war, some, of, the, sullan, nobles, including, quintus, lutatius, catulus, who, had, suffered, under, the, marian, regime, objected, but, by, this, point, depictions, of, husbands, in, aristocratic, women, s, funerary, processions, was, common, contra, plutarch, caesar, s, action, here, was, likely, in, keeping, with, a, political, trend, for, reconciliation, and, normalisation, rather, than, a, display, of, renewed, factionalism, caesar, quickly, remarried, taking, the, hand, of, sulla, s, granddaughter, pompeia, for, much, of, this, period, caesar, was, one, of, pompey, s, supporters, caesar, joined, with, pompey, in, the, late, 70s, to, support, restoration, of, tribunician, rights, his, support, for, the, law, recalling, the, lepidan, exiles, may, have, been, related, to, the, same, tribune, s, bill, to, grant, lands, to, pompey, s, veterans, caesar, also, supported, the, lex, gabinia, in, 67, bc, granting, pompey, an, extraordinary, command, against, piracy, in, the, mediterranean, and, also, supported, the, lex, manilia, in, 66, bc, to, reassign, the, third, mithridatic, war, from, its, then, commander, lucullus, to, pompey, four, years, after, his, aunt, julia, s, funeral, in, 65, bc, caesar, served, as, curule, aedile, and, staged, lavish, games, that, won, him, further, attention, and, popular, support, he, also, restored, the, trophies, won, by, marius, and, taken, down, by, sulla, over, jugurtha, and, the, cimbri, according, to, plutarch, s, narrative, the, trophies, were, restored, overnight, to, the, applause, and, tears, of, joy, of, the, onlookers, any, sudden, and, secret, restoration, of, this, sort, would, not, have, been, possible, architects, restorers, and, other, workmen, would, have, to, have, been, hired, and, paid, for, nor, would, it, have, been, likely, that, the, work, could, have, been, done, in, a, single, night, it, is, more, likely, that, caesar, was, merely, restoring, his, family, s, public, monuments, consistent, with, standard, aristocratic, practice, and, the, virtue, of, pietas, and, over, objections, from, catulus, these, actions, were, broadly, supported, by, the, senate, in, 63, bc, caesar, stood, for, the, praetorship, and, also, for, the, post, of, pontifex, maximus, who, was, the, head, of, the, college, of, pontiffs, and, the, highest, ranking, state, religious, official, in, the, pontifical, election, before, the, tribes, caesar, faced, two, influential, senators, quintus, lutatius, catulus, and, publius, servilius, isauricus, caesar, came, out, victorious, many, scholars, have, expressed, astonishment, that, caesar, s, candidacy, was, taken, seriously, but, this, was, not, without, historical, precedent, ancient, sources, allege, that, caesar, paid, huge, bribes, or, was, shamelessly, ingratiating, that, no, charge, was, ever, laid, alleging, this, implies, that, bribery, alone, is, insufficient, to, explain, his, victory, if, bribes, or, other, monies, were, needed, they, may, have, been, underwritten, by, pompey, whom, caesar, at, this, time, supported, and, who, opposed, catulus, candidacy, many, sources, also, assert, that, caesar, supported, the, land, reform, proposals, brought, that, year, by, plebeian, tribune, publius, servilius, rullus, however, there, are, no, ancient, sources, so, attesting, caesar, also, engaged, in, a, collateral, manner, in, the, trial, of, gaius, rabirius, by, one, of, the, plebeian, tribunes, titus, labienus, for, the, murder, of, saturninus, in, accordance, with, a, senatus, consultum, ultimum, some, forty, years, earlier, the, most, famous, event, of, the, year, was, the, catilinarian, conspiracy, while, some, of, caesar, s, enemies, including, catulus, alleged, that, he, participated, in, the, conspiracy, the, chance, that, he, was, a, participant, is, extremely, small, caesar, won, his, election, to, the, praetorship, in, 63, bc, easily, and, as, one, of, the, praetor, elects, spoke, out, that, december, in, the, senate, against, executing, certain, citizens, who, had, been, arrested, in, the, city, conspiring, with, gauls, in, furtherance, of, the, conspiracy, caesar, s, proposal, at, the, time, is, not, entirely, clear, the, earlier, sources, assert, that, he, advocated, life, imprisonment, without, trial, the, later, sources, assert, he, instead, wanted, the, conspirators, imprisoned, pending, trial, most, accounts, agree, that, caesar, supported, confiscation, of, the, conspirators, property, caesar, likely, advocated, the, former, which, was, a, compromise, position, that, would, place, the, senate, within, the, bounds, of, the, lex, sempronia, de, capite, civis, and, was, initially, successful, in, swaying, the, body, a, later, intervention, by, cato, however, swayed, the, senate, at, the, end, for, execution, during, his, year, as, praetor, caesar, first, attempted, to, deprive, his, enemy, catulus, of, the, honour, of, completing, the, rebuilt, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, accusing, him, of, embezzling, funds, and, threatening, to, bring, legislation, to, reassign, it, to, pompey, this, proposal, was, quickly, dropped, amid, near, universal, opposition, he, then, supported, the, attempt, by, plebeian, tribune, metellus, nepos, to, transfer, the, command, against, catiline, from, the, consul, of, 63, gaius, antonius, hybrida, to, pompey, after, a, violent, meeting, of, the, comitia, tributa, in, the, forum, where, metellus, came, into, fisticuffs, with, his, tribunician, colleagues, cato, and, quintus, minucius, thermus, the, senate, passed, a, decree, against, metellus, suetonius, claims, that, both, nepos, and, caesar, were, deposed, from, their, magistracies, this, would, have, been, a, constitutional, impossibility, which, led, caesar, to, distance, himself, from, the, proposals, hopes, for, a, provincial, command, and, need, to, repair, relations, with, the, aristocracy, took, priority, he, also, was, engaged, in, the, bona, dea, affair, where, publius, clodius, pulcher, sneaked, into, caesar, s, house, sacrilegiously, during, a, female, religious, observance, caesar, avoided, any, part, of, the, affair, by, divorcing, his, wife, immediately, claiming, that, his, wife, needed, to, be, above, suspicion, but, there, is, no, indication, that, caesar, supported, clodius, in, any, way, after, his, praetorship, caesar, was, appointed, to, govern, hispania, ulterior, pro, consule, deeply, indebted, from, his, campaigns, for, the, praetorship, and, for, the, pontificate, caesar, required, military, victory, beyond, the, normal, provincial, extortion, to, pay, them, off, he, campaigned, against, the, callaeci, and, lusitani, and, seized, the, callaeci, capital, in, northwestern, spain, bringing, roman, troops, to, the, atlantic, and, seizing, enough, plunder, to, pay, his, debts, claiming, to, have, completed, the, peninsula, s, conquest, he, made, for, home, after, having, been, hailed, imperator, when, he, arrived, home, in, the, summer, of, 60, bc, he, was, then, forced, to, choose, between, a, triumph, and, election, to, the, consulship, either, he, could, remain, outside, the, pomerium, rome, s, sacred, boundary, awaiting, a, triumph, or, cross, the, boundary, giving, up, his, command, and, triumph, to, make, a, declaration, of, consular, candidacy, attempts, to, waive, the, requirement, for, the, declaration, to, be, made, in, person, were, filibustered, in, the, senate, by, caesar, s, enemy, cato, even, though, the, senate, seemed, to, support, the, exception, faced, with, the, choice, between, a, triumph, and, the, consulship, caesar, chose, the, consulship, caesar, stood, for, the, consulship, of, 59, bc, along, with, two, other, candidates, his, political, position, at, the, time, was, strong, he, had, supporters, among, the, families, which, had, supported, marius, or, cinna, his, connection, with, the, sullan, aristocracy, was, good, his, support, of, pompey, had, won, him, support, in, turn, his, support, for, reconciliation, in, continuing, aftershocks, of, the, civil, war, was, popular, in, all, parts, of, society, with, the, support, of, crassus, who, supported, caesar, s, joint, ticket, with, one, lucius, lucceius, caesar, won, lucceius, however, did, not, and, the, voters, returned, marcus, calpurnius, bibulus, instead, one, of, caesar, s, long, standing, personal, and, political, enemies, after, the, elections, caesar, reconciled, pompey, and, crassus, two, political, foes, in, a, three, way, alliance, misleadingly, termed, the, first, triumvirate, in, modern, times, caesar, was, still, at, work, in, december, of, 60, bc, attempting, to, find, allies, for, his, consulship, and, the, alliance, was, finalised, only, some, time, around, its, start, pompey, and, crassus, joined, in, pursuit, of, two, respective, goals, the, ratification, of, pompey, s, eastern, settlement, and, the, bailing, out, of, tax, farmers, in, asia, many, of, whom, were, crassus, clients, all, three, sought, the, extended, patronage, of, land, grants, with, pompey, especially, seeking, the, promised, land, grants, for, his, veterans, caesar, s, first, act, was, to, publish, the, minutes, of, the, senate, and, the, assemblies, signalling, the, senate, s, accountability, to, the, public, he, then, brought, in, the, senate, a, bill, crafted, to, avoid, objections, to, previous, land, reform, proposals, and, any, indications, of, radicalism, to, purchase, property, from, willing, sellers, to, distribute, to, pompey, s, veterans, and, the, urban, poor, it, would, be, administered, by, a, board, of, twenty, with, caesar, excluded, and, financed, by, pompey, s, plunder, and, territorial, gains, referring, it, to, the, senate, in, hope, that, it, would, take, up, the, matter, to, show, its, beneficence, for, the, people, there, was, little, opposition, and, the, obstructionism, that, occurred, was, largely, unprincipled, firmly, opposing, it, not, on, grounds, of, public, interest, but, rather, opposition, to, caesar, s, political, advancement, unable, to, overcome, cato, s, filibustering, he, moved, the, bill, before, the, people, and, at, a, public, meeting, caesar, s, co, consul, bibulus, threatened, a, permanent, veto, for, the, entire, year, this, clearly, violated, the, people, s, well, established, legislative, sovereignty, and, triggered, a, riot, in, which, bibulus, fasces, were, broken, symbolising, popular, rejection, of, his, magistracy, the, bill, was, then, voted, through, bibulus, attempted, to, induce, the, senate, to, nullify, it, on, grounds, it, was, passed, by, violence, and, contrary, to, the, auspices, but, the, senate, refused, caesar, also, brought, and, passed, a, one, third, write, down, of, tax, farmers, arrears, for, crassus, and, ratification, of, pompey, s, eastern, settlements, both, bills, were, passed, with, little, or, no, debate, in, the, senate, caesar, then, moved, to, extend, his, agrarian, bill, to, campania, some, time, in, may, this, may, be, when, bibulus, withdrew, to, his, house, pompey, shortly, thereafter, also, wed, caesar, s, daughter, julia, to, seal, their, alliance, an, ally, of, caesar, s, plebeian, tribune, publius, vatinius, moved, the, lex, vatinia, assigning, the, provinces, of, illyricum, and, cisalpine, gaul, to, caesar, for, five, years, suetonius, claim, that, the, senate, had, assigned, to, caesar, the, silvae, callesque, woods, and, tracks, is, likely, an, exaggeration, fear, of, gallic, invasion, had, grown, in, 60, bc, and, it, is, more, likely, that, the, consuls, had, been, assigned, to, italy, a, defensive, posture, that, caesarian, partisans, dismissed, as, mere, forest, tracks, the, senate, was, also, persuaded, to, assign, to, caesar, transalpine, gaul, as, well, subject, to, annual, renewal, most, likely, to, control, his, ability, to, make, war, on, the, far, side, of, the, alps, some, time, in, the, year, perhaps, after, the, passing, of, the, bill, distributing, the, campanian, land, and, after, these, political, defeats, bibulus, withdrew, to, his, house, there, he, issued, edicts, in, absentia, purporting, unprecedentedly, to, cancel, all, days, on, which, caesar, or, his, allies, could, hold, votes, for, religious, reasons, cato, too, attempted, symbolic, gestures, against, caesar, which, allowed, him, and, his, allies, to, feign, victimisation, these, tactics, were, successful, in, building, revulsion, to, caesar, and, his, allies, through, the, year, this, opposition, caused, serious, political, difficulties, to, caesar, and, his, allies, belying, the, common, depiction, of, triumviral, political, supremacy, later, in, the, year, however, caesar, with, the, support, of, his, opponents, brought, and, passed, the, lex, julia, de, repetundis, to, crack, down, on, provincial, corruption, when, his, consulship, ended, caesar, s, legislation, was, challenged, by, two, of, the, new, praetors, but, discussion, in, the, senate, stalled, and, was, regardless, dropped, he, stayed, near, the, city, until, some, time, around, mid, march, during, the, gallic, wars, caesar, wrote, his, commentaries, thereon, which, were, acknowledged, even, in, his, time, as, a, latin, literary, masterwork, meant, to, document, caesar, s, campaigns, in, his, own, words, and, maintain, support, in, rome, for, his, military, operations, and, career, he, produced, some, ten, volumes, covering, operations, in, gaul, from, 58, to, 52, bc, each, was, likely, produced, in, the, year, following, the, events, described, and, was, likely, aimed, at, the, general, or, at, least, literate, population, in, rome, the, account, is, naturally, partial, to, caesar, his, defeats, are, excused, and, victories, highlighted, but, it, is, almost, the, sole, source, for, events, in, gaul, in, this, period, gaul, in, 58, bc, was, in, the, midst, of, some, instability, tribes, had, raided, into, transalpine, gaul, and, there, was, an, on, going, struggle, between, two, tribes, in, central, gaul, which, collaterally, involved, roman, alliances, and, politics, the, divisions, within, the, gauls, they, were, no, unified, bloc, would, be, exploited, in, the, coming, years, the, first, engagement, was, in, april, 58, bc, when, caesar, prevented, the, migrating, helvetii, from, moving, through, roman, territory, allegedly, because, he, feared, they, would, unseat, a, roman, ally, building, a, wall, he, stopped, their, movement, near, geneva, and, after, raising, two, legions, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, bibracte, before, forcing, them, to, return, to, their, original, homes, he, was, drawn, further, north, responding, to, requests, from, gallic, tribes, including, the, aedui, for, aid, against, ariovistus, king, of, the, suebi, and, a, declared, friend, of, rome, by, the, senate, during, caesar, s, own, consulship, and, he, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, vosges, wintering, in, northeastern, gaul, near, the, belgae, in, the, winter, of, 58, 57, caesar, s, forward, military, position, triggered, an, uprising, to, remove, his, troops, able, to, eke, out, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, sabis, caesar, spent, much, of, 56, bc, suppressing, the, belgae, and, dispersing, his, troops, to, campaign, across, much, of, gaul, including, against, the, veneti, in, what, is, now, brittany, at, this, point, almost, all, of, gaul, except, its, central, regions, fell, under, roman, subjugation, seeking, to, buttress, his, military, reputation, he, engaged, germans, attempting, to, cross, the, rhine, which, marked, it, as, a, roman, frontier, displaying, roman, engineering, prowess, he, here, built, a, bridge, across, the, rhine, in, a, feat, of, engineering, meant, to, show, rome, s, ability, to, project, power, ostensibly, seeking, to, interdict, british, aid, to, his, gallic, enemies, he, led, expeditions, into, southern, britain, in, 55, and, 54, bc, perhaps, seeking, further, conquests, or, otherwise, wanting, to, impress, readers, in, rome, britain, at, the, time, was, to, the, romans, an, island, of, mystery, and, a, land, of, wonder, he, however, withdrew, from, the, island, in, the, face, of, winter, uprisings, in, gaul, led, by, the, eburones, and, belgae, starting, in, late, 54, bc, which, ambushed, and, virtually, annihilated, a, legion, and, five, cohorts, caesar, was, however, able, to, lure, the, rebels, into, unfavourable, terrain, and, routed, them, in, battle, the, next, year, a, greater, challenge, emerged, with, the, uprising, of, most, of, central, gaul, led, by, vercingetorix, of, the, averni, caesar, was, initially, defeated, at, gergovia, before, besieging, vercingetorix, at, alesia, after, becoming, himself, besieged, caesar, won, a, major, victory, which, forced, vercingetorix, s, surrender, caesar, then, spent, much, of, his, time, into, 51, bc, suppressing, any, remaining, resistance, in, the, initial, years, from, the, end, of, caesar, s, consulship, in, 59, bc, the, three, so, called, triumvirs, sought, to, maintain, the, goodwill, of, the, extremely, popular, publius, clodius, pulcher, who, was, plebeian, tribune, in, 58, bc, and, in, that, year, successfully, sent, cicero, into, exile, when, clodius, took, an, anti, pompeian, stance, later, that, year, he, unsettled, pompey, s, eastern, arrangements, started, attacking, the, validity, of, caesar, s, consular, legislation, and, by, august, 58, forced, pompey, into, seclusion, caesar, and, pompey, responded, by, successfully, backing, the, election, of, magistrates, to, recall, cicero, from, exile, on, the, condition, that, cicero, would, refrain, from, criticism, or, obstruction, of, the, allies, politics, in, rome, fell, into, violent, street, clashes, between, clodius, and, two, tribunes, who, were, friends, of, cicero, with, cicero, now, supporting, the, caesar, and, pompey, caesar, sent, news, of, gaul, to, rome, and, claimed, total, victory, and, pacification, the, senate, at, cicero, s, motion, voted, him, an, unprecedented, fifteen, days, of, thanksgiving, such, reports, were, necessary, for, caesar, especially, in, light, of, senatorial, opponents, to, prevent, the, senate, from, reassigning, his, command, in, transalpine, gaul, even, if, his, position, in, cisalpine, gaul, and, illyricum, was, guaranteed, by, the, lex, vatinia, until, 54, bc, his, success, was, evidently, recognised, when, the, senate, voted, state, funds, for, some, of, caesar, s, legions, which, until, this, time, caesar, had, paid, for, personally, the, three, allies, relations, broke, down, in, 57, bc, one, of, pompey, s, allies, challenged, caesar, s, land, reform, bill, and, the, allies, had, a, poor, showing, in, the, elections, that, year, with, a, real, threat, to, caesar, s, command, and, acta, brewing, in, 56, bc, under, the, aegis, of, the, unfriendly, consuls, caesar, needed, his, allies, political, support, pompey, and, crassus, too, wanted, military, commands, their, combined, interests, led, to, a, renewal, of, the, alliance, drawing, in, the, support, of, appius, claudius, pulcher, and, his, younger, brother, clodius, for, the, consulship, of, 54, bc, they, planned, second, consulships, with, following, governorships, in, 55, bc, for, both, pompey, and, crassus, caesar, for, his, part, would, receive, a, five, year, extension, of, command, cicero, was, induced, to, oppose, reassignment, of, caesar, s, provinces, and, to, defend, a, number, of, the, allies, clients, his, gloomy, predictions, of, a, triumviral, set, of, consuls, designate, for, years, on, end, proved, an, exaggeration, when, only, by, desperate, tactics, bribery, intimidation, and, violence, were, pompey, and, crassus, elected, consuls, for, 55, bc, during, their, consulship, pompey, and, crassus, passed, with, some, tribunician, support, the, lex, pompeia, licinia, extending, caesar, s, command, and, the, lex, trebonia, giving, them, respective, commands, in, spain, and, syria, though, pompey, never, left, for, the, province, and, remained, politically, active, at, rome, the, opposition, again, unified, against, their, heavy, handed, political, tactics, though, not, against, caesar, s, activities, in, gaul, and, defeated, the, allies, in, the, elections, of, that, year, the, ambush, and, destruction, in, gaul, of, a, legion, and, five, cohorts, in, the, winter, of, 55, 54, bc, produced, substantial, concern, in, rome, about, caesar, s, command, and, competence, evidenced, by, the, highly, defensive, narrative, in, caesar, s, commentaries, the, death, of, caesar, s, daughter, and, pompey, s, wife, julia, in, childbirth, c, late, august, 54, did, not, create, a, rift, between, caesar, and, pompey, at, the, start, of, 53, bc, caesar, sought, and, received, reinforcements, by, recruitment, and, a, private, deal, with, pompey, before, two, years, of, largely, unsuccessful, campaigning, against, gallic, insurgents, in, the, same, year, crassus, s, campaign, ended, in, disaster, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, culminating, in, his, death, at, the, hands, of, the, parthians, when, in, 52, bc, pompey, started, the, year, with, a, sole, consulship, to, restore, order, to, the, city, caesar, was, in, gaul, suppressing, insurgencies, after, news, of, his, victory, at, alesia, with, the, support, of, pompey, he, received, twenty, days, of, thanksgiving, and, pursuant, to, the, law, of, the, ten, tribunes, the, right, to, stand, for, the, consulship, in, absentia, from, the, period, 52, to, 49, bc, trust, between, caesar, and, pompey, disintegrated, in, 51, bc, the, consul, marcellus, proposed, recalling, caesar, arguing, that, his, provincia, here, meaning, task, in, gaul, due, to, his, victory, against, vercingetorix, in, 52, was, complete, it, evidently, was, incomplete, as, caesar, was, that, year, fighting, the, bellovaci, and, regardless, the, proposal, was, vetoed, that, year, it, seemed, that, the, conservatives, around, cato, in, the, senate, would, seek, to, enlist, pompey, to, force, caesar, to, return, from, gaul, without, honours, or, a, second, consulship, cato, bibulus, and, their, allies, however, were, successful, in, winning, pompey, over, to, take, a, hard, line, against, caesar, s, continued, command, as, 50, bc, progressed, fears, of, civil, war, grew, both, caesar, and, his, opponents, started, building, up, troops, in, southern, gaul, and, northern, italy, respectively, in, the, autumn, cicero, and, others, sought, disarmament, by, both, caesar, and, pompey, and, on, 1, december, 50, bc, this, was, formally, proposed, in, the, senate, it, received, overwhelming, support, 370, to, 22, but, was, not, passed, when, one, of, the, consuls, dissolved, the, meeting, that, year, when, a, rumour, came, to, rome, that, caesar, was, marching, into, italy, both, consuls, instructed, pompey, to, defend, italy, a, charge, he, accepted, as, a, last, resort, at, the, start, of, 49, bc, caesar, s, renewed, offer, that, he, and, pompey, disarm, was, read, to, the, senate, and, was, rejected, by, the, hardliners, a, later, compromise, given, privately, to, pompey, was, also, rejected, at, their, insistence, on, 7, january, his, supportive, tribunes, were, driven, from, rome, the, senate, then, declared, caesar, an, enemy, and, it, issued, its, senatus, consultum, ultimum, there, is, scholarly, disagreement, as, to, the, specific, reasons, why, caesar, marched, on, rome, a, very, popular, theory, is, that, caesar, was, forced, to, choose, when, denied, the, immunity, of, his, proconsular, tenure, between, prosecution, conviction, and, exile, or, civil, war, in, defence, of, his, position, whether, caesar, actually, would, have, been, prosecuted, and, convicted, is, debated, some, scholars, believe, the, possibility, of, successful, prosecution, was, extremely, unlikely, caesar, s, main, objectives, were, to, secure, a, second, consulship, first, mooted, in, 52, as, colleague, to, pompey, s, sole, consulship, and, a, triumph, he, feared, that, his, opponents, then, holding, both, consulships, for, 50, bc, would, reject, his, candidacy, or, refuse, to, ratify, an, election, he, won, this, also, was, the, core, of, his, war, justification, that, pompey, and, his, allies, were, planning, by, force, if, necessary, indicated, in, the, expulsion, of, the, tribunes, to, suppress, the, liberty, of, the, roman, people, to, elect, caesar, and, honour, his, accomplishments, around, 10, or, 11, january, 49, bc, in, response, to, the, senate, s, final, decree, caesar, crossed, the, rubicon, the, river, defining, the, northern, boundary, of, italy, with, a, single, legion, the, legio, xiii, gemina, and, ignited, civil, war, upon, crossing, the, rubicon, caesar, according, to, plutarch, and, suetonius, is, supposed, to, have, quoted, the, athenian, playwright, menander, in, greek, let, the, die, be, cast, pompey, and, many, senators, fled, south, believing, that, caesar, was, marching, quickly, for, rome, caesar, after, capturing, communication, routes, to, rome, paused, and, opened, negotiations, but, they, fell, apart, amid, mutual, distrust, caesar, responded, by, advancing, south, seeking, to, capture, pompey, to, force, a, conference, pompey, withdrew, to, brundisium, and, was, able, to, escape, to, greece, abandoning, italy, in, face, of, caesar, s, superior, forces, and, evading, caesar, s, pursuit, caesar, stayed, near, rome, for, about, two, weeks, during, his, stay, his, forceful, seizure, of, the, treasury, over, tribunician, veto, put, the, lie, to, his, pro, tribunician, war, justifications, and, left, lepidus, in, charge, of, italy, while, he, attacked, pompey, s, spanish, provinces, he, defeated, two, of, pompey, s, legates, at, the, battle, of, ilerda, before, forcing, surrender, of, the, third, his, legates, moved, into, sicily, and, into, africa, though, the, african, expedition, failed, returning, to, rome, in, the, autumn, caesar, had, lepidus, as, praetor, bring, a, law, appointing, caesar, dictator, to, conduct, the, elections, he, along, with, publius, servilius, isauricus, won, the, following, elections, and, would, serve, as, consuls, for, 48, bc, resigning, the, dictatorship, after, eleven, days, caesar, then, left, italy, for, greece, to, stop, pompey, s, preparations, arriving, in, force, in, early, 48, bc, caesar, besieged, pompey, at, dyrrhachium, but, pompey, was, able, to, break, out, and, force, caesar, s, forces, to, flee, following, pompey, southeast, into, greece, and, to, save, one, of, his, legates, he, engaged, and, decisively, defeated, pompey, at, pharsalus, on, 9, august, 48, bc, pompey, then, fled, for, egypt, cato, fled, for, africa, others, like, cicero, and, marcus, junius, brutus, begged, for, caesar, s, pardon, pompey, was, killed, when, he, arrived, in, alexandria, the, capital, of, egypt, caesar, arrived, three, days, later, on, 2, october, 48, bc, prevented, from, leaving, the, city, by, etesian, winds, caesar, decided, to, arbitrate, an, egyptian, civil, war, between, the, child, pharaoh, ptolemy, xiii, theos, philopator, and, cleopatra, his, sister, wife, and, co, regent, queen, in, late, october, 48, bc, caesar, was, appointed, in, absentia, to, a, year, long, dictatorship, after, news, of, his, victory, at, pharsalus, arrived, to, rome, while, in, alexandria, he, started, an, affair, with, cleopatra, and, withstood, a, siege, by, ptolemy, and, his, other, sister, arsinoe, until, march, 47, bc, reinforced, by, eastern, client, allies, under, mithridates, of, pergamum, he, then, defeated, ptolemy, at, the, battle, of, the, nile, and, installed, cleopatra, as, ruler, caesar, and, cleopatra, celebrated, the, victory, with, a, triumphal, procession, on, the, nile, he, stayed, in, egypt, with, cleopatra, until, june, or, july, that, year, though, the, relevant, commentaries, attributed, to, him, give, no, such, impression, some, time, in, late, june, cleopatra, gave, birth, to, a, child, by, caesar, called, caesarion, when, caesar, landed, at, antioch, he, learnt, that, during, his, time, in, egypt, the, king, of, what, is, now, crimea, pharnaces, had, attempted, to, seize, what, had, been, his, father, s, kingdom, pontus, across, the, black, sea, in, northern, anatolia, his, invasion, had, swept, aside, caesar, s, legates, and, the, local, client, kings, but, caesar, engaged, him, at, zela, and, defeated, him, immediately, leading, caesar, to, write, veni, vidi, vici, i, came, i, saw, i, conquered, downplaying, pompey, s, previous, pontic, victories, he, then, left, quickly, for, italy, caesar, s, absence, from, italy, put, mark, antony, as, magister, equitum, in, charge, his, rule, was, unpopular, publius, cornelius, dolabella, serving, as, plebeian, tribune, in, 47, bc, agitated, for, debt, relief, and, after, that, agitation, got, out, of, hand, the, senate, moved, for, antony, to, restore, order, delayed, by, a, mutiny, in, southern, italy, he, returned, and, suppressed, the, riots, by, force, killing, many, and, delivering, a, similar, blow, to, his, popularity, cato, had, marched, to, africa, and, there, metellus, scipio, was, in, charge, of, the, remaining, republicans, they, allied, with, juba, of, numidia, what, used, to, be, pompey, s, fleet, also, raided, the, central, mediterranean, islands, caesar, s, governor, in, spain, moreover, was, sufficiently, unpopular, that, the, province, revolted, and, switched, to, the, republican, side, caesar, demoted, antony, on, his, return, and, pacified, the, mutineers, without, violence, before, overseeing, the, election, of, the, rest, of, the, magistrates, for, 47, bc, no, elections, had, yet, been, held, and, also, for, those, of, 46, bc, caesar, would, serve, with, lepidus, as, consul, in, 46, he, borrowed, money, for, the, war, confiscated, and, sold, the, property, of, his, enemies, at, fair, prices, and, then, left, for, africa, on, 25, december, 47, bc, caesar, s, landing, in, africa, was, marked, with, some, difficulties, establishing, a, beachhead, and, logistically, he, was, defeated, by, titus, labienus, at, ruspina, on, 4, january, 46, bc, and, thereafter, took, a, rather, cautious, approach, after, inducing, some, desertions, from, the, republicans, caesar, ended, up, surrounded, at, thapsus, his, troops, attacked, prematurely, on, 6, april, 46, bc, starting, a, battle, they, then, won, it, and, massacred, the, republican, forces, without, quarter, marching, on, utica, where, cato, commanded, caesar, arrived, to, find, that, cato, had, killed, himself, rather, than, receive, caesar, s, clemency, many, of, the, remaining, anti, caesarian, leaders, including, metellus, scipio, and, juba, also, committed, suicide, shortly, thereafter, labienus, and, two, of, pompey, s, sons, however, had, moved, to, the, spanish, provinces, in, revolt, caesar, started, a, process, of, annexing, parts, of, numidia, and, then, returned, to, italy, via, sardinia, in, june, 46, bc, caesar, stayed, in, italy, to, celebrate, four, triumphs, in, late, september, supposedly, over, four, foreign, enemies, gaul, egypt, pharnaces, asia, and, juba, africa, he, led, vercingetorix, cleopatra, s, younger, sister, arsinoe, and, juba, s, son, before, his, chariot, vercingetorix, was, executed, according, to, appian, in, some, of, the, triumphs, caesar, paraded, pictures, and, models, of, his, victories, over, fellow, romans, in, the, civil, wars, to, popular, dismay, the, soldiers, were, each, given, 24, 000, sesterces, a, lifetime, s, worth, of, pay, further, games, and, celebrations, were, put, on, for, the, plebs, near, the, end, of, the, year, caesar, heard, bad, news, from, spain, and, with, an, army, left, for, the, peninsula, leaving, lepidus, in, charge, as, magister, equitum, at, a, bloody, battle, at, munda, on, 17, march, 45, bc, caesar, narrowly, found, victory, his, enemies, were, treated, as, rebels, and, he, had, them, massacred, labienus, died, on, the, field, while, one, of, pompey, s, sons, sextus, escaped, the, war, was, effectively, over, caesar, remained, in, the, province, until, june, before, setting, out, for, rome, arriving, in, october, of, the, same, year, and, celebrated, an, unseemly, triumph, over, fellow, romans, by, this, point, he, had, started, preparations, for, war, on, the, parthians, to, avenge, crassus, death, at, carrhae, in, 53, bc, with, wide, ranging, objectives, that, would, take, him, into, dacia, for, three, or, more, years, it, was, set, to, start, on, 18, march, 44, bc, prior, to, caesar, s, assumption, of, the, title, dictator, perpetuo, in, february, 44, bc, he, had, been, appointed, dictator, some, four, times, since, his, first, dictatorship, in, 49, bc, after, occupying, rome, he, engineered, this, first, appointment, largely, to, hold, elections, after, 11, days, he, resigned, the, other, dictatorships, lasted, for, longer, periods, up, to, a, year, and, by, april, 46, bc, he, was, given, a, new, dictatorship, annually, the, task, he, was, assigned, revived, that, of, sulla, s, dictatorship, rei, publicae, constituendae, these, appointments, however, were, not, the, source, of, legal, power, themselves, in, the, eyes, of, the, literary, sources, they, were, instead, honours, and, titles, which, reflected, caesar, s, dominant, position, in, the, state, secured, not, by, extraordinary, magistracy, or, legal, powers, but, by, personal, status, as, victor, over, other, romans, through, the, period, after, pharsalus, the, senate, showered, caesar, with, honours, including, the, title, praefectus, moribus, lit, prefect, of, morals, which, historically, was, associated, with, the, censorial, power, to, revise, the, senate, rolls, he, was, also, granted, power, over, war, and, peace, usurping, a, power, traditionally, held, by, the, comitia, centuriata, these, powers, attached, to, caesar, personally, similarly, extraordinary, were, a, number, of, symbolic, honours, which, saw, caesar, s, portrait, placed, on, coins, in, rome, the, first, for, a, living, roman, with, special, rights, to, wear, royal, dress, sit, atop, a, golden, chair, in, the, senate, and, have, his, statues, erected, in, public, temples, the, month, quintilis, in, which, he, was, born, was, renamed, julius, now, july, these, were, symbols, of, divine, monarchy, and, later, objects, of, resentment, the, decisions, on, the, normal, operation, of, the, state, justice, legislation, administration, and, public, works, were, concentrated, into, caesar, s, person, without, regard, for, or, even, notice, given, to, the, traditional, institutions, of, the, republic, caesar, s, domination, over, public, affairs, and, his, competitive, instinct, to, preclude, all, others, alienated, the, political, class, and, led, eventually, to, the, conspiracy, against, his, life, caesar, as, far, as, is, attested, in, evidence, did, not, intend, to, restructure, roman, society, ernst, badian, writing, in, the, oxford, classical, dictionary, noted, that, although, caesar, did, implement, a, series, of, reforms, they, did, not, touch, on, the, core, of, the, republican, system, he, had, no, plans, for, basic, social, and, constitutional, reform, and, that, the, extraordinary, honours, heaped, upon, him, merely, grafted, him, as, an, ill, fitting, head, on, to, the, body, of, the, traditional, structure, the, most, important, of, caesar, s, reforms, was, to, the, calendar, which, saw, the, abolition, of, the, traditional, republican, lunisolar, calendar, and, its, replacement, with, a, solar, calendar, now, called, the, julian, calendar, he, also, increased, the, number, of, magistrates, and, senators, from, 600, to, 900, to, better, administer, the, empire, and, reward, his, supporters, with, offices, colonies, also, were, founded, outside, italy, notably, on, the, sites, of, carthage, and, corinth, which, had, both, been, destroyed, during, rome, s, 2nd, century, bc, conquests, to, discharge, italy, s, population, into, the, provinces, and, reduce, unrest, the, royal, power, of, naming, patricians, was, revived, to, benefit, the, families, of, his, men, and, the, permanent, courts, jury, pools, were, also, altered, to, remove, the, tribuni, aerarii, leaving, only, the, equestrians, and, senators, he, also, took, further, administrative, actions, to, stabilise, his, rule, and, that, of, the, state, caesar, reduced, the, size, of, the, grain, dole, from, 320, 000, down, to, around, 150, 000, by, tightening, the, qualifications, special, bonuses, were, offered, to, families, with, many, children, to, stall, depopulation, plans, were, drawn, for, the, conduct, of, a, census, citizenship, was, extended, to, a, number, of, communities, in, cisalpine, gaul, and, to, c, diz, during, the, civil, wars, caesar, had, also, instituted, a, novel, debt, repayment, programme, no, debts, would, be, forgiven, but, they, could, be, paid, in, kind, remitted, rents, up, to, a, certain, amount, and, thrown, games, distributing, food, many, of, his, enemies, during, the, civil, wars, were, pardoned, caesar, s, clemency, was, exalted, in, his, propaganda, and, temple, works, with, the, intent, to, cultivate, gratitude, and, draw, a, contrast, between, himself, and, the, vengeful, dictatorship, of, sulla, the, building, programmes, started, prior, to, his, expedition, to, spain, continued, with, the, construction, of, the, forum, of, caesar, and, the, temple, of, venus, genetrix, therein, other, public, works, including, an, expansion, of, ostia, s, port, and, a, canal, through, the, corinthian, isthmus, were, also, planned, very, busy, with, this, work, the, heavy, handedness, with, which, he, ignored, the, senate, magistrates, and, those, who, came, to, visit, him, also, alienated, many, in, rome, the, collegia, civic, associations, restored, by, clodius, in, 58, bc, were, again, abolished, his, actions, to, reward, his, supporters, saw, him, allow, his, subordinates, illegal, triumphal, processions, and, resign, the, consulship, so, that, allies, could, take, it, up, for, the, rest, of, the, year, on, the, last, day, of, 45, bc, when, one, of, the, succeeding, consuls, died, caesar, had, an, ally, elected, as, replacement, for, a, single, day, corruption, on, the, part, of, his, partisans, was, also, overlooked, to, ensure, their, support, provincial, cities, and, client, kingdoms, were, extorted, for, favours, to, pay, his, bills, attempts, in, january, 44, bc, to, call, caesar, rex, lit, king, a, title, associated, with, arbitrary, oppression, against, citizens, were, shut, down, by, two, tribunes, before, a, supportive, crowd, caesar, claiming, that, the, two, tribunes, infringed, on, his, honour, by, doing, so, had, them, deposed, from, office, and, ejected, from, the, senate, the, incident, both, undermined, caesar, s, original, arguments, for, pursuing, the, civil, war, protecting, the, tribunes, and, angered, a, public, which, still, revered, the, tribunes, as, protectors, of, popular, freedom, shortly, before, 15, february, 44, bc, he, assumed, the, dictatorship, for, life, putting, an, end, to, any, hopes, that, his, powers, would, be, merely, temporary, transforming, his, dictatorship, even, with, a, decadal, appointment, into, one, for, life, clearly, showed, to, all, contemporaries, that, caesar, had, no, intention, to, restore, a, free, republic, and, that, no, free, republic, could, be, restored, so, long, as, he, was, in, power, just, days, after, his, assumption, of, the, life, dictatorship, he, publicly, rejected, a, diadem, from, antony, at, celebrations, for, the, lupercalia, interpretations, of, the, episode, vary, he, may, have, been, rejecting, the, diadem, publicly, only, because, the, crowd, was, insufficiently, supportive, he, could, have, done, it, performatively, to, signal, he, was, no, monarch, alternatively, antony, could, have, acted, on, his, own, initiative, by, this, point, however, rumour, was, rife, that, caesar, already, wearing, the, dress, of, a, monarch, sought, a, formal, crown, and, the, episode, did, little, to, reassure, the, plan, to, assassinate, caesar, had, started, by, the, summer, of, 45, bc, an, attempt, to, recruit, antony, was, made, around, that, time, though, he, declined, and, gave, caesar, no, warning, by, february, 44, bc, there, were, some, sixty, conspirators, it, is, clear, that, by, this, time, the, victorious, caesarian, coalition, from, the, civil, war, had, broken, apart, while, most, of, the, conspirators, were, former, pompeians, they, were, joined, by, a, substantial, number, of, caesarians, among, their, leaders, were, gaius, trebonius, consul, in, 45, decimus, brutus, consul, designate, for, 42, as, well, as, cassius, and, brutus, both, praetors, in, 44, bc, trebonius, and, decimus, had, joined, caesar, during, the, war, while, brutus, and, cassius, had, joined, pompey, other, caesarians, involved, included, servius, sulpicius, galba, lucius, minucius, basilus, lucius, tullius, cimber, and, gaius, servilius, casca, many, of, the, conspirators, would, have, been, candidates, in, the, consular, elections, for, 43, to, 41, bc, likely, dismayed, by, caesar, s, sham, elections, in, early, 44, bc, that, produced, advance, results, for, the, years, 43, 41, bc, those, electoral, results, came, from, the, grace, of, the, dictator, and, not, that, of, the, people, for, the, republican, elite, this, was, no, substitute, for, actual, popular, support, nor, is, it, likely, that, the, subordination, of, the, normal, magistrates, to, caesar, s, masters, of, horse, latin, magistri, equitum, was, appreciated, brutus, who, claimed, descent, from, the, lucius, junius, brutus, who, had, driven, out, the, kings, and, the, gaius, servilius, ahala, who, had, freed, rome, from, incipient, tyranny, was, the, main, leader, of, the, conspiracy, by, late, autumn, 45, bc, graffiti, and, some, public, comments, at, rome, were, condemning, caesar, as, a, tyrant, and, insinuating, the, need, for, a, brutus, to, remove, the, dictator, the, ancient, sources, excepting, nicolaus, of, damascus, are, unanimous, that, this, reflected, a, genuine, turn, in, public, opinion, against, caesar, popular, indignation, at, caesar, was, likely, rooted, in, his, debt, policies, too, friendly, to, lenders, use, of, lethal, force, to, suppress, protests, for, debt, relief, his, reduction, in, the, grain, dole, his, abolition, of, the, collegia, restored, by, clodius, his, abolition, of, the, poorest, panel, of, jurors, in, the, permanent, courts, and, his, abolition, of, open, elections, which, deprived, the, people, of, their, ancient, right, of, decision, a, popular, turn, against, caesar, is, also, observed, with, reports, that, the, two, deposed, tribunes, were, written, in, on, ballots, at, caesar, s, advance, consular, elections, in, place, of, caesar, s, candidates, whether, there, was, a, tradition, of, tyrannicide, at, rome, is, unclear, cicero, wrote, in, private, as, if, the, duty, to, kill, tyrants, was, already, given, he, however, made, no, public, speeches, to, that, effect, and, there, is, little, evidence, that, the, public, accepted, the, logic, of, preventive, tyrannicide, the, philosophical, tradition, of, the, platonic, old, academy, was, also, a, factor, driving, brutus, to, action, due, to, its, emphasis, on, a, duty, to, free, the, state, from, tyranny, while, some, news, of, the, conspiracy, did, leak, caesar, refused, to, take, precautions, and, rejected, escort, by, a, bodyguard, the, date, decided, upon, by, the, conspirators, was, 15, march, the, ides, of, march, three, days, before, caesar, intended, to, leave, for, his, parthian, campaign, news, of, his, imminent, departure, forced, the, conspirators, to, move, up, their, plans, the, senate, meeting, on, the, 15th, would, be, the, last, before, his, departure, they, had, decided, that, a, senate, meeting, was, the, best, place, to, frame, the, killing, as, political, rejecting, the, alternatives, at, games, elections, or, on, the, road, that, only, the, conspirators, would, be, armed, at, the, senate, meeting, per, dio, also, would, have, been, an, advantage, the, day, 15, march, was, also, symbolically, important, as, it, was, the, day, on, which, consuls, took, office, until, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, various, stories, purport, that, caesar, was, on, the, cusp, of, not, attending, or, otherwise, being, warned, about, the, plot, approached, on, his, golden, chair, at, the, foot, of, the, statue, of, pompey, the, conspirators, attacked, him, with, daggers, whether, he, fell, in, silence, per, suetonius, or, after, reply, to, brutus, appearance, kai, su, teknon, you, too, child, is, variantly, recorded, he, was, stabbed, at, least, twenty, three, times, and, died, at, once, the, assassins, seized, the, capitoline, hill, after, killing, the, dictator, they, then, summoned, a, public, meeting, in, the, forum, where, they, were, coldly, received, by, the, population, they, were, also, unable, to, fully, secure, the, city, as, lepidus, caesar, s, lieutenant, in, the, dictatorship, moved, troops, from, the, tiber, island, into, the, city, proper, antony, the, consul, who, escaped, the, assassination, urged, an, illogical, compromise, position, in, the, senate, caesar, was, not, declared, a, tyrant, and, the, conspirators, were, not, punished, caesar, s, funeral, was, then, approved, at, the, funeral, antony, inflamed, the, public, against, the, assassins, which, triggered, mob, violence, that, lasted, for, some, months, before, the, assassins, were, forced, to, flee, the, capital, and, antony, then, finally, acted, to, suppress, it, by, force, in, 44, bc, there, was, a, seven, day, cometary, outburst, that, the, romans, believe, to, represent, the, deification, of, caeser, giving, it, the, name, caesar, s, comet, on, the, site, of, his, cremation, the, temple, of, caesar, was, begun, by, the, triumvirs, in, 42, bc, at, the, east, side, of, the, main, square, of, the, roman, forum, only, its, altar, now, remains, the, terms, of, the, will, were, also, read, to, the, public, it, gave, a, generous, donative, to, the, plebs, at, large, and, left, as, principal, heir, one, gaius, octavius, caesar, s, great, nephew, then, at, apollonia, and, adopted, him, in, the, will, resumption, of, the, pre, existing, republic, proved, impossible, as, various, actors, appealed, in, the, aftermath, of, caesar, s, death, to, liberty, or, to, vengeance, to, mobilise, huge, armies, that, led, to, a, series, of, civil, wars, the, first, war, was, between, antony, in, 43, bc, and, the, senate, including, senators, of, both, caesarian, and, pompeian, persuasion, which, resulted, in, octavian, caesar, s, heir, exploiting, the, chaos, to, seize, the, consulship, and, join, with, antony, and, lepidus, to, form, the, second, triumvirate, after, purging, their, political, enemies, in, a, series, of, proscriptions, the, triumvirs, secured, the, deification, of, caesar, the, senate, declared, on, 1, january, 42, bc, that, caesar, would, be, placed, among, the, roman, gods, and, marched, on, the, east, where, a, second, war, saw, the, triumvirs, defeat, the, tyrannicides, in, battle, resulting, in, a, final, death, of, the, republican, cause, and, a, three, way, division, of, much, of, the, roman, world, by, 31, bc, caesar, s, heir, had, taken, sole, control, of, the, empire, ejecting, his, triumviral, rivals, after, two, decades, of, civil, war, pretending, to, restore, the, republic, his, masked, autocracy, was, acceptable, to, the, war, weary, romans, and, marked, the, establishment, of, a, new, roman, monarchy, based, on, remarks, by, plutarch, caesar, is, sometimes, thought, to, have, suffered, from, epilepsy, modern, scholarship, is, sharply, divided, on, the, subject, and, some, scholars, believe, that, he, was, plagued, by, malaria, particularly, during, the, sullan, proscriptions, of, the, 80s, bc, other, scholars, contend, his, epileptic, seizures, were, due, to, a, parasitic, infection, in, the, brain, by, a, tapeworm, caesar, had, four, documented, episodes, of, what, may, have, been, complex, partial, seizures, he, may, additionally, have, had, absence, seizures, in, his, youth, the, earliest, accounts, of, these, seizures, were, made, by, the, biographer, suetonius, who, was, born, after, caesar, died, the, claim, of, epilepsy, is, countered, among, some, medical, historians, by, a, claim, of, hypoglycemia, which, can, cause, epileptoid, seizures, a, line, from, shakespeare, s, julius, caesar, has, sometimes, been, taken, to, mean, that, he, was, deaf, in, one, ear, come, on, my, right, hand, for, this, ear, is, deaf, no, classical, source, mentions, hearing, impairment, in, connection, with, caesar, the, playwright, may, have, been, making, metaphorical, use, of, a, passage, in, plutarch, that, does, not, refer, to, deafness, at, all, but, rather, to, a, gesture, alexander, of, macedon, customarily, made, by, covering, his, ear, alexander, indicated, that, he, had, turned, his, attention, from, an, accusation, in, order, to, hear, the, defence, francesco, m, galassi, and, hutan, ashrafian, suggest, that, caesar, s, behavioral, manifestations, headaches, vertigo, falls, possibly, caused, by, muscle, weakness, due, to, nerve, damage, sensory, deficit, giddiness, and, insensibility, and, syncopal, episodes, were, the, results, of, cerebrovascular, episodes, not, epilepsy, pliny, the, elder, reports, in, his, natural, history, that, caesar, s, father, and, forefather, died, without, apparent, cause, while, putting, on, their, shoes, these, events, can, be, more, readily, associated, with, cardiovascular, complications, from, a, stroke, episode, or, lethal, heart, attack, caesar, possibly, had, a, genetic, predisposition, for, cardiovascular, disease, suetonius, writing, more, than, a, century, after, caesar, s, death, describes, caesar, as, tall, of, stature, with, a, fair, complexion, shapely, limbs, a, somewhat, full, face, and, keen, black, eyes, using, the, latin, alphabet, of, the, period, which, lacked, the, letters, j, and, u, caesar, s, name, would, be, rendered, gaivs, ivlivs, caesar, the, form, caivs, is, also, attested, using, the, older, roman, representation, of, g, by, c, the, standard, abbreviation, was, c, ivlivs, c, sar, reflecting, the, older, spelling, the, letterform, is, a, ligature, of, the, letters, a, and, e,

greek, a, language, most, educated, romans, studied, young, wealthy, roman, boys, were, often, taught, by, greek, slaves, and, sometimes, sent, to, athens, for, advanced, training, as, was, caesar, s, principal, assassin, brutus, in, greek, during, caesar, s, time, his, family, name, was, written, ka, sar, reflecting, its, contemporary, pronunciation, thus, his, name, is, pronounced, in, a, similar, way, to, the, pronunciation, of, the, german, kaiser, or, dutch, keizer, in, vulgar, latin, the, original, diphthong, first, began, to, be, pronounced, as, a, simple, long, vowel, then, the, plosive, k, before, front, vowels, began, due, to, palatalization, to, be, pronounced, as, an, affricate, hence, renderings, like, in, italian, and, in, german, regional, pronunciations, of, latin, as, well, as, the, title, of, tsar, with, the, evolution, of, the, romance, languages, the, affricate, became, a, fricative, thus, in, many, regional, pronunciations, including, the, french, one, from, which, the, modern, english, pronunciation, is, derived, caesar, s, cognomen, itself, became, a, title, it, was, promulgated, by, the, bible, which, contains, the, famous, verse, render, unto, caesar, the, things, which, are, caesar, s, and, unto, god, the, things, that, are, god, s, the, title, became, from, the, late, first, millennium, kaiser, in, german, and, through, old, church,

means, that, for, approximately, two, thousand, years, there, was, at, least, one, head, of, state, bearing, his, name, as, a, term, for, the, highest, ruler, the, word, caesar, constitutes, one, of, the, earliest, best, attested, and, most, widespread, latin, loanwords, in, the, germanic, languages, being, found, in, the, text, corpora, of, old, high, german, keisar, old, saxon, k, sur, old, english, c, sere, old, norse, keisari, old, dutch, keisere, and, through, greek, gothic, kaisar, some, ancient, sources, refer, to, the, possibility, of, the, tyrannicide, marcus, junius, brutus, being, one, of, julius, caesar, s, illegitimate, children, caesar, at, the, time, brutus, was, born, was, 15, most, ancient, historians, were, sceptical, of, this, and, on, the, whole, scholars, have, rejected, the, possibility, that, brutus, was, the, love, child, of, servilia, and, caesar, on, the, grounds, of, chronology, grandchild, from, julia, and, pompey, dead, at, several, days, unnamed, roman, society, viewed, the, passive, role, during, sexual, activity, regardless, of, gender, to, be, a, sign, of, submission, or, inferiority, indeed, suetonius, says, that, in, caesar, s, gallic, triumph, his, soldiers, sang, that, caesar, may, have, conquered, the, gauls, but, nicomedes, conquered, caesar, according, to, cicero, bibulus, gaius, memmius, and, others, mainly, caesar, s, enemies, he, had, an, affair, with, nicomedes, iv, of, bithynia, early, in, his, career, the, stories, were, repeated, referring, to, caesar, as, the, queen, of, bithynia, by, some, roman, politicians, as, a, way, to, humiliate, him, caesar, himself, denied, the, accusations, repeatedly, throughout, his, lifetime, and, according, to, cassius, dio, even, under, oath, on, one, occasion, this, form, of, slander, was, popular, during, this, time, in, the, roman, republic, to, demean, and, discredit, political, opponents, catullus, wrote, a, poem, suggesting, that, caesar, and, his, engineer, mamurra, were, lovers, but, later, apologised, mark, antony, charged, that, octavian, had, earned, his, adoption, by, caesar, through, sexual, favors, suetonius, described, antony, s, accusation, of, an, affair, with, octavian, as, political, slander, octavian, eventually, became, the, first, roman, emperor, as, augustus, during, his, lifetime, caesar, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, best, orators, and, prose, authors, in, latin, even, cicero, spoke, highly, of, caesar, s, rhetoric, and, style, only, caesar, s, war, commentaries, have, survived, a, few, sentences, from, other, works, are, quoted, by, other, authors, among, his, lost, works, are, his, funeral, oration, for, his, paternal, aunt, julia, and, his, anticato, a, document, attacking, cato, in, response, to, cicero, s, eulogy, poems, by, julius, caesar, are, also, mentioned, in, ancient, sources, other, works, historically, have, been, attributed, to, caesar, but, their, authorship, is, in, doubt, these, narratives, were, written, and, published, annually, during, or, just, after, the, actual, campaigns, as, a, sort, of, dispatches, from, the, front, they, were, important, in, shaping, caesar, s, public, image, and, enhancing, his, reputation, when, he, was, away, from, rome, for, long, periods, they, may, have, been, presented, as, public, readings, as, a, model, of, clear, and, direct, latin, style, the, gallic, wars, traditionally, has, been, studied, by, first, or, second, year, latin, students, the, texts, written, by, caesar, an, autobiography, of, the, most, important, events, of, his, public, life, are, the, most, complete, primary, source, for, the, reconstruction, of, his, biography, however, caesar, wrote, those, texts, with, his, political, career, in, mind, julius, caesar, is, also, considered, one, of, the, first, historical, figures, to, fold, his, message, scrolls, into, a, concertina, form, which, made, them, easier, to, read, the, roman, emperor, augustus, began, a, cult, of, personality, of, caesar, which, described, augustus, as, caesar, s, political, heir, the, modern, historiography, is, influenced, by, this, tradition, many, rulers, in, history, became, interested, in, the, historiography, of, caesar, napoleon, iii, wrote, the, scholarly, work, histoire, de, jules, c, sar, which, was, not, finished, the, second, volume, listed, previous, rulers, interested, in, the, topic, charles, viii, ordered, a, monk, to, prepare, a, translation, of, the, gallic, wars, in, 1480, charles, v, ordered, a, topographic, study, in, france, to, place,

there, daily, and, special, commemorations, take, place, on, march, 15, to, commemorate, caesar, s, death, julius, caesar, is, seen, as, the, main, example, of, caesarism, a, form, of, political, rule, led, by, a, charismatic, strongman, whose, rule, is, based, upon, a, cult, of, personality, whose, rationale, is, the, need, to, rule, by, force, establishing, a, violent, social, order, and, being, a, regime, involving, prominence, of, the, military, in, the, government, other, people, in, history, such, as, the, french, napoleon, bonaparte, and, the, italian, benito, mussolini, have, defined, themselves, as, caesarists, bonaparte, did, not, focus, only, on, caesar, s, military, career, but, also, on, his, relation, with, the, masses, a, predecessor, to, populism, the, word, is, also, used, in, a, pejorative, manner, by, critics, of, this, type, of, political, rule, atrebates, aduatuci
