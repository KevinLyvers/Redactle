was, published, in, 1969, angelou, was, hailed, as, a, new, kind, of, memoirist, one, of, the, first, african, american, women, who, were, able, to, publicly, discuss, their, personal, lives, according, to, scholar, hilton, als, up, to, that, point, black, female, writers, were, marginalized, to, the, point, that, they, were, unable, to, present, themselves, as, central, characters, in, the, literature, they, wrote, linguist, john, mcwhorter, agreed, seeing, angelou, s, works, which, he, called, tracts, as, apologetic, writing, he, placed, angelou, in, the, tradition, of, african, american, literature, as, a, defense, of, black, culture, which, he, called, a, literary, manifestation, of, the, imperative, that, reigned, in, the, black, scholarship, of, the, period, writer, julian, mayfield, who, called, caged, bird, a, work, of, art, that, eludes, description, argued, that, angelou, s, autobiographies, set, a, precedent, for, not, only, other, black, women, writers, but, also, african, american, autobiography, as, a, whole, als, said, that, caged, bird, marked, one, of, the, first, times, that, a, black, autobiographer, could, as, he, put, it, write, about, blackness, from, the, inside, without, apology, or, defense, through, the, writing, of, her, autobiography, angelou, became, recognized, and, highly, respected, as, a, spokesperson, for, blacks, and, women, it, made, her, without, a, doubt, america, s, most, visible, black, woman, autobiographer, and, a, major, autobiographical, voice, of, the, time, as, writer, gary, younge, said, probably, more, than, almost, any, other, writer, alive, angelou, s, life, literally, is, her, work, als, said, that, caged, bird, helped, increase, black, feminist, writings, in, the, 1970s, less, through, its, originality, than, its, resonance, in, the, prevailing, zeitgeist, or, the, time, in, which, it, was, written, at, the, end, of, the, american, civil, rights, movement, als, also, claimed, that, angelou, s, writings, more, interested, in, self, revelation, than, in, politics, or, feminism, have, freed, other, female, writers, to, open, themselves, up, without, shame, to, the, eyes, of, the, world, angelou, critic, joanne, m, braxton, stated, that, caged, bird, was, perhaps, the, most, aesthetically, pleasing, autobiography, written, by, an, african, american, woman, in, its, era,

they, did, in, all, of, 1992, accounting, for, a, 1, 200, increase, angelou, famously, said, in, response, to, criticism, regarding, using, the, details, of, her, life, in, her, work, i, agree, with, balzac, and, 19th, century, writers, black, and, white, who, say, i, write, for, money, younge, speaking, after, the, publication, of, angelou, s, third, book, of, essays, letter, to, my, daughter,

used, in, narrative, and, multicultural, approaches, in, teacher, education, jocelyn, a, glazier, a, professor, at, george, washington, university, has, trained, teachers, how, to, talk, about, race, in, their, classrooms, with, i, know, why, the, caged, bird, sings, and, gather, together, in, my, name, according, to, glazier, angelou, s, use, of, understatement, self, mockery, humor, and, irony, have, left, readers, of, angelou, s, autobiographies, unsure, of, what, she, left, out, and, how, they, should, respond, to, the, events, she, described, angelou, s, depictions, of, her, experiences, of, racism, have, forced, white, readers, to, either, explore, their, feelings, about, race, and, their, own, privileged, status, or, to, avoid, the, discussion, as, a, means, of, keeping, their, privilege, glazier, found, that, critics, have, focused, on, the, way, angelou, fits, within, the, genre, of, african, american, autobiography, and, on, her, literary, techniques, but, readers, have, tended, to, react, to, her, storytelling, with, surprise, particularly, when, enter, the, text, with, certain, expectations, about, the, genre, of, autobiography, educator, daniel, challener, in, his, 1997, book, stories, of, resilience, in, childhood, analyzed, the, events, in, caged, bird, to, illustrate, resiliency, in, children, he, argued, that, angelou, s, book, has, provided, a, useful, framework, for, exploring, the, obstacles, many, children, like, maya, have, faced, and, how, their, communities, have, helped, them, succeed, psychologist, chris, boyatzis, has, reported, using, caged, bird, to, supplement, scientific, theory, and, research, in, the, instruction, of, child, development, topics, such, as, the, development, of, self, concept, and, self, esteem, ego, resilience, industry, versus, inferiority, effects, of, abuse, parenting, styles, sibling, and, friendship, relations, gender, issues, cognitive, development, puberty, and, identity, formation, in, adolescence, he, found, caged, bird, a, highly, effective, tool, for, providing, real, life, examples, of, these, psychological, concepts, angelou, is, best, known, for, her, seven, autobiographies, but, she, was, also, a, prolific, and, successful, poet, she, was, called, the, black, woman, s, poet, laureate, and, her, poems, have, been, called, the, anthems, of, african, americans, angelou, studied, and, began, writing, poetry, at, a, young, age, and, used, poetry, and, other, great, literature, to, cope, with, her, rape, as, a, young, girl, as, described, in, caged, bird, according, to, scholar, yasmin, y, degout, literature, also, affected, angelou, s, sensibilities, as, the, poet, and, writer, she, became, especially, the, liberating, discourse, that, would, evolve, in, her, own, poetic, canon, many, critics, consider, angelou, s, autobiographies, more, important, than, her, poetry, although, all, her, books, have, been, bestsellers, her, poetry, has, not, been, perceived, to, be, as, serious, as, her, prose, and, has, been, understudied, her, poems, were, more, interesting, when, she, recited, and, performed, them, and, many, critics, emphasized, the, public, aspect, of, her, poetry, angelou, s, lack, of, critical, acclaim, has, been, attributed, to, both, the, public, nature, of, many, of, her, poems, and, to, angelou, s, popular, success, and, to, critics, preferences, for, poetry, as, a, written, form, rather, than, a, verbal, performed, one, zofia, burr, has, countered, angelou, s, critics, by, condemning, them, for, not, taking, into, account, angelou, s, larger, purposes, in, her, writing, to, be, representative, rather, than, individual, authoritative, rather, than, confessional, in, the, view, of, harold, bloom, professor, of, literature, yale, university, and, new, york, university, and, literary, critic, her, poetry, has, a, large, public, but, very, little, critical, esteem, it, is, in, every, sense, popular, poetry, and, makes, no, formal, or, cognitive, demands, upon, the, reader, of, angelou, s, sincerity, good, will, towards, all, and, personal, vitality, there, can, be, no, doubt, she, is, professionally, an, inspirational, writer, of, the, self, help, variety, which, perhaps, places, her, beyond, criticism, angelou, seems, best, at, ballads, the, most, traditional, kind, of, popular, poetry, the, function, of, such, work, is, necessarily, social, rather, than, aesthetic, particularly, in, an, era, totally, dominated, by, visual, media, one, has, to, be, grateful, for, the, benignity, humor, and, whole, heartedness, of, angelou, s, project, even, if, her, autobiographical, prose, necessarily, centers, her, achievement, angelou, s, use, of, fiction, writing, techniques, such, as, dialogue, characterization, and, development, of, theme, setting, plot, and, language, has, often, resulted, in, the, placement, of, her, books, into, the, genre, of, autobiographical, fiction, angelou, made, a, deliberate, attempt, in, her, books, to, challenge, the, common, structure, of, the, autobiography, by, critiquing, changing, and, expanding, the, genre, scholar, mary, jane, lupton, argues, that, all, of, angelou, s, autobiographies, conform, to, the, genre, s, standard, structure, they, are, written, by, a, single, author, they, are, chronological, and, they, contain, elements, of, character, technique, and, theme, angelou, recognizes, that, there, are, fictional, aspects, to, her, books, lupton, agrees, stating, that, angelou, tended, to, diverge, from, the, conventional, notion, of, autobiography, as, truth, which, parallels, the, conventions, of, much, of, african, american, autobiography, written, during, the, abolitionist, period, of, u, s, history, when, as, both, lupton, and, african, american, scholar, crispin, sartwell, put, it, the, truth, was, censored, out, of, the, need, for, self, protection, scholar, lyman, b, hagen, places, angelou, in, the, long, tradition, of, african, american, autobiography, but, claims, that, angelou, created, a, unique, interpretation, of, the, autobiographical, form, according, to, african, american, literature, scholar, pierre, a, walker, the, challenge, for, much, of, the, history, of, african, american, literature, was, that, its, authors, have, had, to, confirm, its, status, as, literature, before, they, could, accomplish, their, political, goals, which, was, why, angelou, s, editor, robert, loomis, was, able, to, dare, her, into, writing, caged, bird, by, challenging, her, to, write, an, autobiography, that, could, be, considered, high, art, angelou, acknowledged, that, she, followed, the, slave, narrative, tradition, of, speaking, in, the, first, person, singular, talking, about, the, first, person, plural, always, saying, i, meaning, we, scholar, john, mcwhorter, calls, angelou, s, books, tracts, that, defend, african, american, culture, and, fight, negative, stereotypes, according, to, mcwhorter, angelou, structured, her, books, which, to, him, seem, to, be, written, more, for, children, than, for, adults, to, support, her, defense, of, black, culture, mcwhorter, sees, angelou, as, she, depicts, herself, in, her, autobiographies, as, a, kind, of, stand, in, figure, for, the, black, american, in, troubled, times, mcwhorter, views, angelou, s, works, as, dated, but, recognizes, that, she, has, helped, to, pave, the, way, for, contemporary, black, writers, who, are, able, to, enjoy, the, luxury, of, being, merely, individuals, no, longer, representatives, of, the, race, only, themselves, scholar, lynn, z, bloom, compares, angelou, s, works, to, the, writings, of, frederick, douglass, stating, that, both, fulfilled, the, same, purpose, to, describe, black, culture, and, to, interpret, it, for, their, wider, white, audiences, according, to, scholar, sondra, o, neale, angelou, s, poetry, can, be, placed, within, the, african, american, oral, tradition, and, her, prose, follows, classic, technique, in, nonpoetic, western, forms, o, neale, states, that, angelou, avoided, using, a, monolithic, black, language, and, accomplished, through, direct, dialogue, what, o, neale, calls, a, more, expected, ghetto, expressiveness, mcwhorter, finds, both, the, language, angelou, used, in, her, autobiographies, and, the, people, she, depicted, unrealistic, resulting, in, a, separation, between, her, and, her, audience, as, mcwhorter, states, i, have, never, read, autobiographical, writing, where, i, had, such, a, hard, time, summoning, a, sense, of, how, the, subject, talks, or, a, sense, of, who, the, subject, really, is, mcwhorter, asserts, for, example, that, key, figures, in, angelou, s, books, like, herself, her, son, guy, and, mother, vivian, do, not, speak, as, one, would, expect, and, that, their, speech, is, cleaned, up, for, her, readers, guy, for, example, represents, the, young, black, male, while, vivian, represents, the, idealized, mother, figure, and, the, stiff, language, they, use, as, well, as, the, language, in, angelou, s, text, is, intended, to, prove, that, blacks, can, use, standard, english, competently, mcwhorter, recognizes, that, much, of, the, reason, for, angelou, s, style, was, the, apologetic, nature, of, her, writing, when, angelou, wrote, caged, bird, at, the, end, of, the, 1960s, one, of, the, necessary, and, accepted, features, of, literature, at, the, time, was, organic, unity, and, one, of, her, goals, was, to, create, a, book, that, satisfied, that, criterion, the, events, in, her, books, were, episodic, and, crafted, like, a, series, of, short, stories, but, their, arrangements, did, not, follow, a, strict, chronology, instead, they, were, placed, to, emphasize, the, themes, of, her, books, which, include, racism, identity, family, and, travel, english, literature, scholar, valerie, sayers, has, asserted, that, angelou, s, poetry, and, prose, are, similar, they, both, rely, on, her, direct, voice, which, alternates, steady, rhythms, with, syncopated, patterns, and, uses, similes, and, metaphors, e, g, the, caged, bird, according, to, hagen, angelou, s, works, were, influenced, by, both, conventional, literary, and, the, oral, traditions, of, the, african, american, community, for, example, she, referenced, more, than, 100, literary, characters, throughout, her, books, and, poetry, in, addition, she, used, the, elements, of, blues, music, including, the, act, of, testimony, when, speaking, of, one, s, life, and, struggles, ironic, understatement, and, the, use, of, natural, metaphors, rhythms, and, intonations, angelou, instead, of, depending, upon, plot, used, personal, and, historical, events, to, shape, her, books
