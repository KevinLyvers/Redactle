shahnameh, book, of, kings, of, the, medieval, persian, epic, of, ferdowsi, d, 1020, give, much, information, regarding, khosrow, s, reforms, and, thus, most, likely, drew, both, of, their, information, from, the, middle, persian, history, book, khwaday, namag, book, of, lords, other, works, were, made, independently, such, as, the, sirat, anushirwan, which, was, reportedly, an, autobiography, made, by, khosrow, himself, and, survives, in, the, work, of, miskawayh, 932, 1030, khosrow, is, also, mentioned, in, several, greek, sources, such, as, the, ones, of, procopius, agathias, and, menander, protector, who, all, give, important, information, regarding, khosrow, s, management, of, the, irano, roman, wars, syriac, authors, such, as, john, of, ephesus, and, zacharias, rhetor, also, include, khosrow, in, their, work, offering, a, perception, of, the, consequences, that, his, expeditions, brought, on, the, people, who, lived, on, the, roman, border, khosrow, i, was, reportedly, born, between, 512, and, 514, at, ardestan, a, town, located, in, the, spahan, province, in, central, iran, the, town, dating, back, to, the, achaemenid, period, thrived, during, khosrow, s, age, and, also, included, a, fire, temple, which, was, said, to, be, founded, by, the, mythological, kayanian, king, kay, bahman, from, whom, the, sasanians, claimed, their, descent, khosrow, was, the, youngest, son, of, kavad, i, the, ruling, sasanian, shah, his, mother, was, an, ispahbudhan, princess, who, was, the, sister, of, the, leading, iranian, general, bawi, the, ispahbudhan, were, one, of, the, seven, great, houses, of, iran, that, formed, the, elite, aristocracy, of, the, sasanian, empire, they, in, particular, enjoyed, such, a, high, status, that, they, were, acknowledged, as, kin, and, partners, of, the, sasanians, the, family, also, held, the, important, position, of, spahbed, of, the, west, i, e, the, sasanian, empire, s, southwestern, regions, khwarwaran, following, the, tradition, of, the, aristocratic, or, upper, class, families, khosrow, would, have, started, at, school, frahangest, n, between, the, age, of, five, and, seven, there, he, would, learn, to, write, and, would, learn, the, yashts, hadokht, bay, n, yasn, and, vendidad, following, the, same, pattern, of, schooling, made, for, a, future, priest, herbed, furthermore, he, would, observe, the, middle, persian, translation, of, the, avesta, the, zend, afterwards, he, would, be, schooled, in, riding, archery, polo, chovgan, and, military, creativity, in, c, 520, kavad, in, order, to, secure, the, succession, of, khosrow, whose, position, was, threatened, by, rival, brothers, and, the, mazdakite, sect, proposed, that, emperor, justin, i, adopt, him, the, proposal, was, initially, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, the, byzantine, emperor, and, his, nephew, justinian, but, justin, s, quaestor, proclus, opposed, the, move, due, to, the, concern, of, khosrow, possibly, later, try, to, take, over, the, byzantine, throne, the, byzantines, instead, made, a, counter, proposal, to, adopt, khosrow, not, as, a, roman, but, a, barbarian, in, the, end, the, negotiations, did, not, come, to, a, consensus, khosrow, reportedly, felt, insulted, by, the, byzantines, and, his, attitude, deteriorated, towards, them, mahbod, who, had, along, with, siyawush, acted, as, the, diplomats, of, the, negotiations, accused, the, latter, of, purposely, sabotaging, the, negotiations, further, accusations, were, made, towards, siyawush, which, included, the, reverence, of, new, deities, and, having, his, dead, wife, buried, which, was, a, violation, of, iranian, laws, siyawush, was, thus, most, likely, a, mazdakite, the, religious, sect, that, kavad, originally, supported, but, now, had, withdrawn, his, support, from, although, siyawush, was, a, close, friend, of, kavad, and, had, helped, him, escape, from, imprisonment, the, latter, did, not, try, to, prevent, his, execution, seemingly, with, the, purpose, of, restricting, siyawush, s, immense, authority, as, the, head, of, the, sasanian, army, a, post, which, was, disliked, by, the, other, nobles, siyawush, was, executed, and, his, office, was, abolished, despite, the, breakdown, of, the, negotiations, it, was, not, until, 530, that, full, scale, warfare, on, the, main, eastern, frontier, broke, out, in, the, intervening, years, the, two, sides, preferred, to, wage, war, by, proxy, through, arab, allies, in, the, south, and, huns, in, the, north, mazdak, was, the, name, of, a, chief, representative, of, a, religious, and, philosophical, teaching, called, mazdakism, which, opposed, violence, and, called, for, the, sharing, of, wealth, women, and, property, an, archaic, form, of, communism, mazdakism, not, only, consisted, of, theological, and, cosmological, aspects, but, also, political, and, social, impacts, which, was, to, the, disadvantage, of, the, nobility, and, clergy, according, to, modern, historians, touraj, daryaee, and, matthew, canepa, sharing, women, was, most, likely, an, overstatement, and, defamation, deriving, from, mazdak, s, decree, that, loosened, marriage, rules, to, help, the, lower, classes, powerful, families, saw, this, as, a, tactic, to, weaken, their, lineage, and, advantages, which, was, most, likely, the, case, kavad, used, the, movement, as, a, political, tool, to, curb, the, power, of, the, nobility, and, clergy, with, the, nobility, and, clergy, weakened, kavad, was, able, to, make, reforms, with, less, difficulty, with, the, reforms, roaring, by, the, 520s, he, no, longer, had, any, use, for, mazdak, as, a, result, he, officially, withdrew, his, support, from, the, mazdakites, a, debate, was, arranged, where, not, only, the, zoroastrian, priesthood, but, also, the, christian, and, jewish, ones, slandered, mazdak, and, his, followers, according, to, the, shahnameh, the, book, of, kings, written, several, centuries, later, by, the, medieval, persian, poet, ferdowsi, kavad, had, mazdak, and, his, supporters, sent, to, khosrow, who, had, his, supporters, killed, by, burying, their, heads, in, a, walled, orchard, with, only, their, feet, being, visible, khosrow, then, summoned, mazdak, to, look, at, his, garden, saying, the, following, you, will, find, trees, there, that, no, one, has, ever, seen, and, no, one, ever, heard, of, even, from, the, mouth, of, the, ancient, sages, mazdak, seeing, his, followers, corpses, screamed, and, passed, out, he, was, afterwards, executed, by, khosrow, who, had, his, feet, fastened, on, a, gallows, and, had, his, men, shoot, arrows, at, him, the, validity, of, the, story, is, uncertain, ferdowsi, used, much, earlier, reports, of, events, to, write, the, shahnameh, and, thus, the, story, may, report, some, form, of, contemporary, memory, in, 531, while, the, iranian, army, was, besieging, martyropolis, kavad, became, ill, and, died, khosrow, succeeded, him, but, due, to, his, domestic, position, being, insecure, he, wanted, to, make, peace, with, the, byzantines, who, themselves, under, emperor, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, were, perhaps, already, more, focused, on, recovering, the, lost, western, half, of, the, roman, empire, than, in, pursuing, war, against, iran, the, byzantine, envoys, rufinus, hermogenes, alexander, and, thomas, found, khosrow, in, a, more, conciliatory, disposition, than, his, father, and, an, agreement, was, soon, reached, justinian, would, pay, 110, centenaria, 11, 000, pounds, of, gold, ostensibly, as, a, contribution, to, the, defence, of, the, caucasus, passes, against, the, barbarians, living, beyond, and, the, base, of, the, dux, mesopotamiae, would, be, withdrawn, from, the, fortress, of, dara, to, the, city, of, constantina, the, two, rulers, would, recognize, once, again, each, other, as, equal, and, pledged, mutual, assistance, khosrow, initially, refused, to, hand, back, the, two, lazic, forts, while, demanding, the, return, of, the, two, other, forts, the, byzantines, had, captured, in, sasanian, armenia, justinian, at, first, agreed, but, soon, changed, his, mind, causing, the, agreement, to, be, broken, off, in, summer, 532, however, a, new, embassy, by, hermogenes, and, rufinus, managed, to, persuade, khosrow, for, a, full, exchange, of, the, occupied, forts, as, well, as, for, allowing, the, exiled, iberian, rebels, to, either, remain, in, the, byzantine, empire, or, return, safely, to, their, homes, sometime, during, the, early, reign, of, khosrow, he, had, to, deal, with, his, eldest, brother, kawus, who, ruled, as, governor, king, of, the, northern, province, of, padishkhwargar, unlike, khosrow, he, was, a, mazdakite, or, at, least, had, strong, mazdakite, sympathies, and, thus, had, their, support, as, the, candidate, for, the, throne, kawus, asserted, to, be, the, legitimate, heir, of, the, throne, due, to, his, older, age, he, was, however, defeated, by, khosrow, s, forces, and, taken, to, ctesiphon, where, khosrow, summoned, the, priests, and, urged, kawus, to, make, confessions, and, ask, for, forgiveness, so, that, he, could, be, released, kawus, refused, preferring, death, forcing, khosrow, to, have, him, killed, khosrow, reportedly, cursed, the, fortunes, for, forcing, him, to, kill, a, brother, like, kawus, another, danger, to, khosrow, s, rule, was, that, of, his, uncle, bawi, who, along, with, other, members, of, the, iranian, aristocracy, became, involved, in, a, conspiracy, in, which, they, tried, to, overthrow, khosrow, and, make, kavad, the, son, of, khosrow, s, brother, jamasp, the, shah, of, iran, upon, learning, of, the, plot, khosrow, executed, all, his, brothers, and, their, offspring, along, with, bawi, and, the, other, aristocrats, who, were, involved, khosrow, also, ordered, the, execution, of, kavad, who, was, still, a, child, and, was, away, from, the, court, being, raised, by, adergoudounbades, khosrow, sent, orders, to, kill, kavad, but, adergoudounbades, disobeyed, and, brought, him, up, in, secret, until, he, was, betrayed, to, the, shah, in, 541, by, his, own, son, bahram, khosrow, had, him, executed, but, kavad, or, someone, claiming, to, be, him, managed, to, flee, to, the, byzantine, empire, khosrow, i, represents, the, epitome, of, the, philosopher, king, in, the, sasanian, empire, upon, his, ascent, to, the, throne, khosrow, did, not, restore, power, to, the, feudal, nobility, or, the, magi, but, centralized, his, government, khosrow, s, reign, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, successful, within, the, sasanian, empire, the, peace, agreement, between, rome, and, iran, in, 531, gave, khosrow, the, chance, to, consolidate, power, and, focus, his, attention, on, internal, improvement, his, reforms, and, military, campaigns, marked, a, renaissance, of, the, sasanian, empire, which, spread, philosophic, beliefs, as, well, as, trade, goods, from, the, far, east, to, the, far, west, the, internal, reforms, under, khosrow, were, much, more, important, than, those, on, the, exterior, frontier, the, subsequent, reforms, resulted, in, the, rise, of, a, bureaucratic, state, at, the, expense, of, the, great, noble, families, strengthening, the, central, government, and, the, power, of, the, shahanshah, the, army, too, was, reorganized, and, tied, to, the, central, government, rather, than, local, nobility, allowing, greater, organization, faster, mobilization, and, a, far, greater, cavalry, corps, reforms, in, taxation, provided, the, empire, with, stability, and, a, much, stronger, economy, allowing, prolonged, military, campaigns, as, well, as, greater, revenues, for, the, bureaucracy, khosrow, s, tax, reforms, have, been, praised, by, several, scholars, the, most, notable, of, whom, is, f, altheim, the, tax, reforms, which, were, started, under, kavad, i, and, completely, implemented, by, khosrow, greatly, strengthened, the, royal, court, prior, to, khosrow, and, kavad, s, reigns, a, majority, of, the, land, was, owned, by, seven, parthian, families, suren, waraz, karen, ispahbudhan, spandiyadh, mihran, and, zik, these, great, landowners, enjoyed, tax, exemptions, from, the, sasanian, empire, and, were, tax, collectors, within, their, local, provincial, areas, with, the, outbreak, of, the, mazdakite, revolution, there, was, a, great, uprising, of, peasants, and, lower, class, citizens, who, grabbed, large, portions, of, land, under, egalitarian, values, as, a, result, of, this, there, was, great, confusion, on, land, possession, and, ownership, khosrow, surveyed, all, the, land, within, the, empire, indiscriminately, and, began, to, tax, all, land, under, a, single, program, tax, revenues, that, previously, went, to, the, local, noble, family, now, went, to, the, central, government, treasury, the, fixed, tax, that, khosrow, implemented, created, a, more, stable, form, of, income, for, the, treasury, because, the, tax, did, not, vary, the, treasury, could, easily, estimate, the, year, s, revenue, prior, to, khosrow, s, tax, reforms, taxes, were, collected, based, on, the, yield, that, the, land, had, produced, the, new, system, calculated, and, averaged, taxation, based, on, the, water, rights, for, each, piece, of, property, lands, which, grew, date, palms, and, olive, trees, used, a, slightly, different, method, of, taxation, based, on, the, amount, of, producing, trees, that, the, land, contained, these, tax, reforms, of, khosrow, were, the, stepping, stone, which, enabled, subsequent, reforms, in, the, bureaucracy, and, the, military, to, take, place, the, hallmark, of, khosrow, s, bureaucratic, reform, was, the, creation, of, a, new, social, class, before, the, sasanian, empire, consisted, of, only, three, social, classes, magi, nobles, and, peasants, commoners, khosrow, added, a, fourth, class, to, this, hierarchy, between, the, nobles, and, the, peasants, called, the, dehqans, the, dehqans, were, small, land, owning, citizens, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, were, considered, lower, nobility, khosrow, promoted, honest, government, officials, based, on, trust, and, honesty, rather, than, corrupt, nobles, and, magi, the, small, landowning, deghans, were, favored, over, the, high, nobles, because, they, tended, to, be, more, trustworthy, and, owed, their, loyalty, to, the, shah, for, their, position, in, the, bureaucracy, the, rise, of, deghans, became, the, backbone, of, the, empire, because, they, now, held, the, majority, of, land, and, positions, in, local, and, provincial, administration, the, reduction, of, power, of, the, great, families, improved, the, empire, this, was, because, previously, each, great, family, ruled, a, large, chunk, of, land, and, had, their, own, king, the, name, shahanshah, meaning, king, of, kings, derived, from, the, fact, that, there, were, many, feudal, kings, in, sasanian, iran, with, the, shahanshah, as, the, ruler, of, them, all, their, fall, meant, their, power, was, redirected, to, the, central, government, and, all, taxes, now, went, to, the, central, government, rather, than, to, the, local, nobility, major, reforms, to, the, military, made, the, iranian, army, capable, of, fighting, sustained, wars, battling, on, multiple, fronts, and, deploy, itself, faster, prior, to, khosrow, s, reign, much, like, other, aspects, of, the, empire, the, military, was, dependent, on, the, feudal, lords, of, the, great, families, to, provide, soldiers, and, cavalry, each, family, would, provide, their, own, army, and, equipment, when, called, by, the, shahanshah, this, system, was, replaced, with, the, emergence, of, the, lower, deghan, nobility, class, who, was, paid, and, provided, by, the, central, government, the, main, force, of, the, sasanian, army, was, the, aswaran, cavalry, previously, only, nobles, could, enlist, into, the, aswaran, cavalry, which, was, very, limited, and, created, shortages, in, well, trained, soldiers, now, that, the, dehqan, class, was, considered, nobility, they, were, able, to, join, the, cavalry, force, and, boosted, the, number, of, cavalry, force, significantly, the, military, reform, focused, more, on, organization, and, training, of, troops, the, cavalry, was, still, the, most, important, aspect, of, the, iranian, military, with, foot, archers, being, less, important, and, mass, peasant, forces, being, on, the, bottom, of, the, spectrum, khosrow, made, four, military, districts, with, a, spahbed, or, general, in, charge, of, each, district, before, the, reforms, of, khosrow, the, general, of, the, iranians, eran, spahbed, controlled, the, military, of, the, entire, empire, the, four, zones, consisted, of, mesopotamia, in, the, west, the, caucasus, region, in, the, north, the, persian, gulf, in, the, central, and, southwest, region, and, central, asia, in, the, east, this, new, quadripartition, of, the, empire, not, only, created, a, more, efficient, military, system, but, also, of, a, vast, multiregional, multicultural, and, multiracial, empire, during, khosrow, s, reign, a, list, for, equipment, for, the, cavalry, aswaran, was, written, the, list, comprised, a, helmet, a, gorget, a, chain, mail, shirt, a, lamellar, coat, or, cuirass, leg, armour, gauntlets, sword, shield, two, bows, with, spare, strings, 30, arrows, axe, or, mace, and, horse, armour, sasanian, bullae, showing, the, four, spahbeds, show, that, horses, were, still, fully, armoured, during, this, period, and, heavy, cavalry, tactics, were, still, used, by, the, sasanian, cavalry, it, is, highly, likely, that, the, stirrup, had, been, introduced, to, the, sasanian, cavalry, two, centuries, before, khosrow, s, reforms, and, are, mentioned, in, bivar, 1972, and, a, stirrupped, foot, position, can, be, seen, on, the, sasanian, bullae, and, at, taq, e, bostan, in, 539, khosrow, had, originally, attempted, to, gain, a, casus, belli, against, the, byzantines, by, trying, to, take, advantage, of, a, disagreement, between, his, lakhmid, clients, and, the, byzantine, clients, ghassanids, who, both, claimed, ownership, of, the, lands, south, of, palmyra, near, the, old, strata, diocletiana, his, attempt, was, however, thwarted, when, the, byzantines, successfully, equivocated, the, problem, subsequently, khosrow, accused, justinian, of, trying, to, bribe, the, lakhmid, ruler, al, mundhir, iii, ibn, al, nu, man, r, 503, 554, through, his, diplomat, summus, and, also, that, he, had, emboldened, some, huns, to, make, incursions, into, iran, the, ghassanid, ruler, al, harith, ibn, jabalah, r, 528, 569, invaded, mundhir, s, territory, and, carried, off, rich, booty, khosrow, complained, to, justinian, about, this, incident, and, requested, that, the, stolen, riches, be, returned, to, him, including, payment, for, the, arabs, that, had, been, killed, during, the, attack, his, request, was, however, ignored, this, incident, along, with, the, support, by, an, emissary, from, the, ostrogoth, king, vitiges, and, the, armenians, living, in, byzantine, territory, being, dissatisfied, with, their, rule, encouraged, khosrow, to, renew, the, war, against, the, byzantines, justinian, s, ceaseless, wars, in, north, africa, and, italy, must, have, contributed, to, khosrow, s, aspirations, as, well, justinian, informed, of, khosrow, s, intention, for, war, tried, to, dissuade, him, but, to, no, avail, in, may, 540, khosrow, invaded, the, domains, of, the, byzantines, he, avoided, the, fortress, of, circesium, and, instead, approached, zenobia, where, he, made, a, lukewarm, attempt, to, persuade, the, fortress, to, surrender, which, proved, unsuccessful, he, then, proceeded, to, sura, and, killed, its, commander, arsaces, in, battle, demoralized, by, the, death, of, their, commander, the, residents, sent, their, bishop, to, parley, with, khosrow, feigning, to, accept, the, plea, of, the, bishop, khosrow, took, advantage, of, the, occasion, and, captured, the, city, which, was, shortly, sacked, germanus, the, cousin, of, justinian, sent, the, bishop, of, beroea, megas, to, negotiate, with, khosrow, regardless, khosrow, continued, his, expedition, threatening, the, city, of, hierapolis, whose, custodians, swiftly, paid, him, 2, 000, pounds, or, 910, kilograms, of, silver, to, leave, the, city, untouched, after, receiving, additional, pleas, by, megas, khosrow, agreed, to, end, his, expedition, in, return, for, ten, centenaria, while, megas, went, back, to, antioch, to, inform, germanus, of, khosrow, s, demands, the, latter, approached, beroea, which, he, had, sacked, in, june, khosrow, reached, antioch, where, he, offered, its, citizens, to, not, attack, the, city, in, return, for, ten, centenaria, his, offer, was, rejected, and, as, a, result, he, captured, and, sacked, the, city, justinian, sued, for, peace, and, made, a, treaty, with, khosrow, that, the, iranians, would, withdraw, back, to, their, domains, in, return, for, a, payment, of, 50, centenaria, plus, 5, centenaria, extra, each, year, part, of, treaty, also, included, that, the, byzantine, envoys, were, to, be, hostages, of, khosrow, as, an, assurance, that, the, byzantines, would, honor, the, agreement, however, before, departing, khosrow, went, to, the, port, of, antioch, seleucia, pieria, where, he, bathed, in, the, mediterranean, sea, he, then, told, the, envoys, that, he, wished, to, visit, the, city, of, apamea, out, of, interest, which, they, reluctantly, allowed, him, with, the, condition, that, he, would, leave, for, his, domains, afterwards, there, he, held, chariot, races, where, he, made, the, blue, faction, which, was, supported, by, justinian, lose, against, the, rival, greens, khosrow, extracted, tribute, from, apamea, and, other, byzantine, towns, at, which, point, justinian, called, off, his, truce, and, prepared, to, send, his, commander, belisarius, to, move, against, the, sasanians, in, spring, 541, khosrow, brought, his, army, north, to, lazica, on, request, of, the, lazic, king, gubazes, ii, to, repel, the, byzantines, from, his, territory, the, fortress, of, petra, was, afterwards, captured, by, khosrow, s, forces, and, a, protectorate, was, established, over, the, country, at, the, same, time, belisarius, arrived, in, mesopotamia, and, began, besieging, the, city, of, nisibis, although, belisarius, had, greatly, outnumbered, the, city, garrison, the, city, was, too, well, fortified, and, he, was, forced, to, ravage, the, country, around, the, nisibis, subsequently, getting, recalled, back, west, after, successful, campaigns, in, armenia, khosrow, was, encouraged, once, again, to, attack, syria, khosrow, turned, south, towards, edessa, and, besieged, the, city, edessa, was, now, a, much, more, important, city, than, antioch, was, and, the, garrison, which, occupied, the, city, was, able, to, resist, the, siege, the, iranians, were, forced, to, retreat, from, edessa, but, were, able, to, forge, a, five, year, truce, with, the, byzantine, empire, in, 545, three, years, into, the, five, year, truce, 548, rebellion, against, sasanian, control, broke, out, in, lazica, in, response, a, byzantine, army, was, sent, to, support, the, people, of, lazica, effectively, ending, the, established, truce, and, thus, continuing, the, lazic, wars, sometime, later, khosrow, who, was, keen, to, wrest, dara, from, byzantine, control, and, would, do, so, even, if, he, risked, to, break, the, truce, they, had, made, regarding, mesopotamia, tried, to, capture, it, by, tricking, them, he, sent, one, of, highest, officials, izadgushasp, as, a, diplomat, to, constantinople, but, in, reality, the, latter, would, stop, by, dara, and, with, the, aid, of, his, large, crew, he, would, seize, the, city, however, this, plan, was, prevented, by, a, former, adviser, of, belisarius, named, george, who, demanded, that, if, izadgushasp, should, enter, the, city, he, should, have, only, twenty, members, of, his, crew, with, him, izadgushasp, then, left, the, city, and, continued, his, journey, to, constantinople, where, he, was, amicably, welcomed, by, justinian, who, gave, him, some, gifts, in, 549, the, previous, truce, between, justinian, and, khosrow, was, disregarded, and, full, war, broke, out, once, again, between, iranians, and, romans, the, last, major, decisive, battle, of, the, lazic, wars, came, in, 556, when, byzantine, general, martin, defeated, a, massive, sasanian,

day, with, a, stable, peace, agreement, with, the, byzantines, in, the, west, khosrow, was, now, able, to, focus, his, attention, on, the, eastern, hephthalites, and, end, their, domination, over, central, asia, even, with, the, growth, of, iranian, military, power, under, khosrow, s, reforms, the, sasanians, were, still, uneasy, at, the, prospect, of, attacking, the, hephthalite, on, their, own, and, began, to, seek, allies, their, answer, came, in, the, form, of, turkic, incursions, into, central, asia, the, movement, of, turkic, people, into, central, asia, very, quickly, made, them, natural, enemies, and, competitors, to, the, hephthalites, the, hephthalites, were, a, strong, military, power, but, they, lacked, the, organization, to, fight, on, multiple, fronts, the, sasanians, and, the, first, turkic, khaganate, made, an, alliance, and, in, 557, launched, a, two, pronged, attack, on, the, hephthalites, taking, advantage, of, their, disorganization, and, disunity, the, hephthalite, empire, was, destroyed, after, the, battle, of, gol, zarriun, and, broke, into, several, minor, kingdoms, around, the, oxus, the, hephthalite, king, ghadfar, and, what, was, left, of, his, men, fled, southward, to, sasanian, territory, where, they, took, refuge, meanwhile, the, turkic, khagan, sinjibu, reached, an, agreement, with, the, hephthalite, nobility, and, appointed, faghanish, the, ruler, of, chaghaniyan, as, the, new, hephthalite, king, this, was, much, to, the, dislike, of, khosrow, who, considered, the, turkic, collaboration, with, the, hephthalites, to, pose, a, danger, for, his, rule, in, the, east, and, thus, marched, towards, the, sasanian, turkic, border, in, gurgan, when, he, reached, the, place, he, was, met, by, a, turkic, delegate, of, sinjibu, that, presented, him, gifts, there, khosrow, asserted, his, authority, and, military, potency, and, persuaded, the, turks, to, make, an, alliance, with, him, the, alliance, contained, a, treaty, that, made, it, obligatory, for, faghanish, to, be, sent, to, the, sasanian, court, in, ctesiphon, and, gain, the, approval, of, khosrow, for, his, status, as, hephthalite, king, faghanish, and, his, kingdom, of, chaghaniyan, thus, became, a, vassal, of, the, sasanian, empire, which, set, the, oxus, as, the, eastern, frontier, the, sasanians, and, turks, however, friendly, relations, between, turks, and, sasanians, quickly, deteriorated, after, that, both, turks, and, iranians, wanted, to, dominate, the, silk, road, and, the, trade, industry, between, the, west, and, the, far, east, in, 562, khosrow, ii, defeated, the, hephthalites, once, again, and, then, stopped, the, threat, of, the, turks, in, 568, a, turkic, embassy, was, sent, to, byzantine, to, propose, an, alliance, and, two, pronged, attack, on, the, sasanian, empire, fortunately, for, the, sasanians, nothing, ever, came, from, this, proposal, later, in, 569, 570, sinjibu, attacked, and, pillaged, sasanian, border, lands, but, a, treaty, was, soon, signed, khosrow, then, sent, a, mihranid, named, mihransitad, to, estimate, the, quality, of, the, daughter, of, the, turkic, khagan, according, to, armenian, sources, her, name, was, kayen, while, persian, sources, states, that, her, name, was, qaqim, khaqan, after, mihransitad, s, visit, in, central, asia, khosrow, married, qaqim, khaqan, according, to, some, sources, hormizd, iv, the, successor, of, khosrow, was, the, son, of, the, turkic, princess, however, encyclop, dia, iranica, states, that, the, marriage, with, the, daughter, of, the, turkic, khaqan, is, chronologically, impossible, and, says, that, hormizd, was, born, in, 540, thirty, years, before, khosrow, s, marriage, in, 522, before, khosrow, s, reign, a, group, of, miaphysite, ethiopians, led, an, attack, on, the, dominant, himyarites, of, southern, arabia, the, local, arab, leader, blunted, the, attack, and, appealed, to, the, sasanians, for, aid, while, the, ethiopians, subsequently, turned, towards, the, byzantines, for, help, the, ethiopians, sent, another, force, across, the, red, sea, killed, the, arab, leader, and, crowned, an, ethiopian, king, of, the, region, in, 531, justinian, suggested, that, the, ethiopians, of, yemen, end, the, sasanians, maritime, trade, with, the, indians, the, ethiopians, never, met, this, request, because, an, ethiopian, general, named, abraha, took, control, of, the, yemenite, throne, and, created, an, independent, nation, after, abraha, s, death, one, of, his, sons, ma, d, karib, went, into, exile, while, his, half, brother, took, the, throne, after, being, denied, by, justinian, ma, d, karib, sought, help, from, khosrow, who, sent, a, small, fleet, and, army, under, commander, vahrez, to, depose, the, current, king, of, yemen, after, capturing, the, capital, city, san, a, l, ma, d, karib, s, son, saif, enthroned, justinian, was, ultimately, responsible, for, sasanian, maritime, presence, in, yemen, by, not, providing, the, yemenite, arabs, support, khosrow, was, able, to, help, ma, d, karib, and, subsequently, established, yemen, as, a, principality, of, the, sasanian, empire, justinian, died, in, 565, and, left, justin, ii, to, succeed, the, throne, in, 555, the, sasanian, governor, of, armenia, and, a, relative, of, khosrow, chihor, vishnasp, also, known, as, suren, built, a, fire, temple, at, the, armenian, capital, dvin, and, put, to, death, a, popular, and, influential, member, of, the, mamikonian, family, this, execution, created, tremendous, civil, unrest, and, led, to, a, revolt, and, massacre, of, the, governor, including, the, capture, of, dvin, in, 572, justin, ii, took, advantage, of, this, revolt, and, used, it, as, an, excuse, to, stop, paying, annual, payments, to, khosrow, effectively, putting, an, end, to, the, 51, year, peace, treaty, that, was, established, ten, years, earlier, khosrow, who, tried, to, avoid, another, war, sent, a, christian, diplomat, named, sebokht, to, constantinople, in, order, to, try, to, persuade, justin, to, change, his, mind, justin, however, refused, to, listen, to, the, diplomat, and, prepared, to, help, the, armenians, whom, he, considered, his, allies, in, their, war, against, khosrow, a, byzantine, army, was, sent, into, sasanian, territory, and, besieged, nisibis, in, the, same, year, meanwhile, khosrow, sent, an, army, under, golon, mihran, to, armenia, but, the, latter, was, defeated, in, taron, by, the, armenian, rebel, leader, vardan, iii, mamikonian, who, captured, his, war, elephants, as, war, booty, sometime, later, however, golon, mihran, managed, to, seize, angl, during, the, same, time, the, siunian, prince, vahan, asked, for, khosrow, s, permission, that, he, could, move, his, court, from, dvin, to, the, capital, of, paytakaran, a, region, in, eastern, armenia, furthermore, vahan, also, requested, that, paytakaran, should, be, merged, with, the, adurbadagan, province, khosrow, accepted, and, did, what, he, asked, in, 573, khosrow, sent, an, army, under, adarmahan, to, invade, syria, while, he, himself, along, with, the, three, mihranid, military, officers, izadgushasp, fariburz, and, bahram, chobin, led, an, army, towards, dara, where, they, captured, the, city, after, four, months, while, adarmahan, sacked, several, cities, in, syria, which, included, apamea, justin, reportedly, lost, his, mind, after, these, byzantine, disasters, and, abdicated, he, was, succeeded, by, tiberius, a, high, ranking, military, officer, in, 578, khosrow, invaded, armenia, once, again, feeling, that, he, had, the, upper, hand, and, was, initially, successful, soon, after, the, tables, turned, and, the, byzantines, gained, a, lot, of, local, support, this, made, the, sasanians, attempt, another, truce, however, sometime, later, khosrow, with, an, army, consisting, of, 12, 000, iranian, soldiers, including, a, combined, of, sabir, arab, soldiers, numbering, 8, 000, sent, by, his, allies, ravaged, the, places, around, resaina, and, constantia, in, syria, thus, turning, the, tables, once, more, during, the, same, time, one, of, khosrow, s, chief, generals, tamkhosrau, managed, to, trick, maurice, by, faking, an, invasion, of, theodosiopolis, and, then, plundered, the, countryside, of, martyropolis, and, amida, however, the, tables, of, the, war, quickly, turned, again, when, the, newly, appointed, byzantine, supreme, commander, maurice, entered, the, field, and, captured, many, sasanian, settlements, the, revolt, came, to, an, end, when, khosrow, gave, amnesty, to, armenia, and, brought, them, back, into, the, sasanian, empire, peace, negotiations, were, once, again, brought, back, up, but, abruptly, ended, with, the, death, of, khosrow, in, 579, who, was, succeeded, by, his, son, hormizd, iv, khosrow, like, all, other, sasanian, rulers, was, an, adherent, of, zoroastrianism, since, the, 5th, century, the, sasanian, monarchs, had, been, made, aware, of, the, significance, of, the, religious, minorities, in, the, realm, and, as, a, result, tried, to, homogenize, them, into, a, structure, of, administration, where, according, to, legal, principles, all, would, be, treated, straightforwardly, as, mard, zan, ahr, i, e, man, woman, citizen, of, the, empire, jews, and, notably, christians, had, accepted, the, concept, of, iran, and, considered, themselves, part, of, the, nation, by, the, time, of, khosrow, the, leader, of, the, church, of, the, east, had, the, title, of, catholicos, of, iran, r, n, cathollicos, sasanian, monarchs, only, persecuted, other, religions, when, it, was, in, their, urgent, political, interests, to, do, this, also, applied, to, khosrow, who, in, the, words, of, eberhard, sauer, had, to, walk, a, fine, line, khosrow, himself, used, the, church, considerably, and, was, fond, of, its, patriarch, aba, i, whom, he, wanted, to, defend, against, the, zoroastrian, priests, nevertheless, aba, was, accused, of, working, with, the, byzantines, which, was, a, serious, allegation, due, to, the, war, that, had, begun, in, 540, consequently, in, 542, aba, was, dismissed, from, his, post, but, was, only, exiled, instead, of, being, executed, khosrow, even, enjoyed, good, relations, with, gregory, the, mihranid, commander, of, the, iranian, troops, in, the, caucasus, who, had, showily, disowned, zoroastrianism, in, front, of, other, troops, massed, at, a, feast, in, 518, this, resulted, in, discontent, amongst, members, of, the, court, who, pressured, khosrow, to, deal, with, an, apostate, from, such, a, powerful, and, influential, family, stating, that, it, is, a, great, dishonor, for, the, religion, of, the, magians, that, such, a, great, man, from, the, lineage, of, the, house, of, mihran, who, have, always, been, servants, of, ohrmazd, now, becomes, a, servant, of, christ, khosrow, was, thus, forced, to, have, gregory, relieved, and, incarcerated, yet, the, mihranids, deemed, khosrow, s, choice, insufficient, a, son, of, gregory, s, paternal, uncle, mihran, asked, khosrow, to, execute, gregory, for, bringing, dishonor, to, our, lineage, the, latter, was, in, a, good, position, to, make, such, request, due, to, recently, having, defeated, the, hephthalites, in, the, east, gregory, was, eventually, executed, khosrow, did, however, deal, harshly, and, swiftly, with, people, with, of, any, belief, or, practice, that, ran, contrary, to, sasanian, mediated, zoroastrian, orthodoxy, aberrance, in, ceremony, and, principle, exceeded, apostasy, as, a, social, and, political, evil, in, undermining, the, foundations, of, the, imperial, religion, payne, according, to, khosrow, s, supposed, autobiographical, work, of, sirat, anushirwan, he, had, a, party, of, nobles, practicing, unorthodoxy, executed, instantly, when, he, found, out, about, them, according, to, the, book, khosrow, also, had, another, group, supposedly, manichaeans, banished, from, iran, this, was, due, to, the, royal, anxieties, regarding, the, chance, of, religious, rogues, to, upset, the, political, structure, which, had, recently, occurred, during, kavad, and, khosrow, s, reigns, by, the, mazdakites, khosrow, is, known, to, have, ordered, many, public, works, projects, during, his, long, reign, such, bridges, roads, dams, and, walls, to, protect, the, frontiers, of, iran, khosrow, had, a, sequence, of, walls, built, and, fortified, around, his, empire, much, like, the, great, wall, of, china, and, hadrian, s, wall, in, northern, england, instead, of, constructing, it, on, one, side, of, the, empire, he, had, it, on, four, according, to, middle, persian, sources, khosrow, i, ordered, the, construction, of, the, great, wall, of, gorgan, which, extended, from, the, eastern, coast, of, the, caspian, sea, to, block, incursions, by, nomadic, tribes, such, as, the, hephthalites, in, the, northwest, he, had, the, derbent, wall, further, fortified, to, protect, the, area, from, incursions, by, alans, turks, sarirs, khazars, and, other, northern, neighbours, another, wall, was, constructed, in, the, southwest, called, the, war, i, t, zig, n, wall, of, the, arabs, he, may, have, also, built, another, wall, in, the, northeast, the, wall, of, tammisha, besides, defense, structures, khosrow, also, had, a, large, scale, canal, system, created, in, asoristan, known, in, islamic, sources, as, the, nahrawan, canal, out, of, all, his, constructions, his, most, memorable, and, noteworthy, achievement, was, the, palace, he, had, made, at, ctesiphon, known, as, the, taq, e, kasra, the, palace, still, standing, till, this, day, albeit, heavily, ruined, portrays, one, of, the, empire, s, most, remarkable, architectural, accomplishments, after, the, sack, of, antioch, in, 540, khosrow, built, a, new, city, one, parasang, 4, 5, kilometres, or, 2, 5, 3, 1, miles, south, of, ctesiphon, for, the, inhabitants, he, had, captured, it, was, located, on, the,
