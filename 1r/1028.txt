protect, me, and, my, royal, house, herodotus, a, greek, historian, and, author, of, the, histories, provided, an, account, of, many, persian, kings, and, the, greco, persian, wars, he, wrote, extensively, on, darius, spanning, half, of, book, 3, along, with, books, 4, 5, and, 6, it, begins, with, the, removal, of, the, alleged, usurper, gaumata, and, continues, to, the, end, of, darius, s, reign, darius, was, the, eldest, of, five, sons, to, hystaspes, the, identity, of, his, mother, is, uncertain, according, to, the, modern, historian, alireza, shapour, shahbazi, 1994, darius, s, mother, was, thought, to, have, been, a, woman, named, rhodogune, however, according, to, lloyd, llewellyn, jones, 2013, recently, uncovered, texts, in, persepolis, indicate, that, his, mother, was, irdabama, an, affluent, landowner, descended, from, a, family, of, local, elamite, rulers, richard, stoneman, likewise, refers, to, irdabama, as, the, mother, of, darius, the, behistun, inscription, of, darius, states, that, his, father, was, satrap, of, bactria, in, 522, bce, according, to, herodotus, iii, 139, darius, prior, to, seizing, power, and, of, no, consequence, at, the, time, had, served, as, a, spearman, doryphoros, in, the, egyptian, campaign, 528, 525, bce, of, cambyses, ii, then, the, persian, great, king, this, is, often, interpreted, to, mean, he, was, the, king, s, personal, spear, carrier, an, important, role, hystaspes, was, an, officer, in, cyrus, s, army, and, a, noble, of, his, court, before, cyrus, and, his, army, crossed, the, river, araxes, to, battle, with, the, armenians, he, installed, his, son, cambyses, ii, as, king, in, case, he, should, not, return, from, battle, however, once, cyrus, had, crossed, the, aras, river, he, had, a, vision, in, which, darius, had, wings, atop, his, shoulders, and, stood, upon, the, confines, of, europe, and, asia, the, known, world, when, cyrus, awoke, from, the, dream, he, inferred, it, as, a, great, danger, to, the, future, security, of, the, empire, as, it, meant, that, darius, would, one, day, rule, the, whole, world, however, his, son, cambyses, was, the, heir, to, the, throne, not, darius, causing, cyrus, to, wonder, if, darius, was, forming, treasonable, and, ambitious, designs, this, led, cyrus, to, order, hystaspes, to, go, back, to, persis, and, watch, over, his, son, strictly, until, cyrus, himself, returned, there, are, different, accounts, of, the, rise, of, darius, to, the, throne, from, both, darius, himself, and, greek, historians, the, oldest, records, report, a, convoluted, sequence, of, events, in, which, cambyses, ii, lost, his, mind, murdered, his, brother, bardiya, and, was, killed, by, an, infected, leg, wound, after, this, darius, and, a, group, of, six, nobles, traveled, to, sikayauvati, to, kill, an, usurper, gaumata, who, had, taken, the, throne, by, pretending, to, be, bardiya, during, the, true, king, s, absence, darius, s, account, written, at, the, behistun, inscription, states, that, cambyses, ii, killed, his, own, brother, bardiya, but, that, this, murder, was, not, known, among, the, iranian, people, a, would, be, usurper, named, gaumata, came, and, lied, to, the, people, stating, that, he, was, bardiya, the, iranians, had, grown, rebellious, against, cambyses, s, rule, and, on, 11, march, 522, bce, a, revolt, against, cambyses, broke, out, in, his, absence, on, 1, july, the, iranian, people, chose, to, be, under, the, leadership, of, gaumata, as, bardiya, no, member, of, the, achaemenid, family, would, rise, against, gaumata, for, the, safety, of, their, own, life, darius, who, had, served, cambyses, as, his, lance, bearer, until, the, deposed, ruler, s, death, prayed, for, aid, and, in, september, 522, bce, along, with, otanes, intaphrenes, gobryas, hydarnes, megabyzus, and, aspathines, killed, gaumata, in, the, fortress, of, sikayauvati, herodotus, provides, a, dubious, account, of, darius, s, ascension, several, days, after, gaumata, had, been, assassinated, darius, and, the, other, six, nobles, discussed, the, fate, of, the, empire, at, first, the, seven, discussed, the, form, of, government, a, democratic, republic, isonomia, was, strongly, pushed, by, otanes, an, oligarchy, was, pushed, by, megabyzus, while, darius, pushed, for, a, monarchy, after, stating, that, a, republic, would, lead, to, corruption, and, internal, fighting, while, a, monarchy, would, be, led, with, a, single, mindedness, not, possible, in, other, governments, darius, was, able, to, convince, the, other, nobles, to, decide, who, would, become, the, monarch, six, of, them, decided, on, a, test, with, otanes, abstaining, as, he, had, no, interest, in, being, king, they, were, to, gather, outside, the, palace, mounted, on, their, horses, at, sunrise, and, the, man, whose, horse, neighed, first, in, recognition, of, the, rising, sun, would, become, king, according, to, herodotus, darius, had, a, slave, oebares, who, rubbed, his, hand, over, the, genitals, of, a, mare, that, darius, s, horse, favored, when, the, six, gathered, oebares, placed, his, hands, beside, the, nostrils, of, darius, s, horse, who, became, excited, at, the, scent, and, neighed, this, was, followed, by, lightning, and, thunder, leading, the, others, to, dismount, and, kneel, before, darius, in, recognition, of, his, apparent, divine, providence, in, this, account, darius, himself, claimed, that, he, achieved, the, throne, not, through, fraud, but, cunning, even, erecting, a, statue, of, himself, mounted, on, his, neighing, horse, with, the, inscription, darius, son, of, hystaspes, obtained, the, sovereignty, of, persia, by, the, sagacity, of, his, horse, and, the, ingenious, contrivance, of, oebares, his, groom, according, to, the, accounts, of, greek, historians, cambyses, ii, had, left, patizeithes, in, charge, of, the, kingdom, when, he, headed, for, egypt, he, later, sent, prexaspes, to, murder, bardiya, after, the, killing, patizeithes, put, his, brother, gaumata, a, magian, who, resembled, bardiya, on, the, throne, and, declared, him, the, great, king, otanes, discovered, that, gaumata, was, an, impostor, and, along, with, six, other, iranian, nobles, including, darius, created, a, plan, to, oust, the, pseudo, bardiya, after, killing, the, impostor, along, with, his, brother, patizeithes, and, other, magians, darius, was, crowned, king, the, following, morning, the, details, regarding, darius, s, rise, to, power, is, generally, acknowledged, as, forgery, and, was, in, reality, used, as, a, concealment, of, his, overthrow, and, murder, of, cyrus, s, rightful, successor, bardiya, to, legitimize, his, rule, darius, had, a, common, origin, fabricated, between, himself, and, cyrus, by, designating, achaemenes, as, the, eponymous, founder, of, their, dynasty, in, reality, darius, was, not, from, the, same, house, as, cyrus, and, his, forebears, the, rulers, of, anshan, following, his, coronation, at, pasargadae, darius, moved, to, ecbatana, he, soon, learned, that, support, for, bardiya, was, strong, and, revolts, in, elam, and, babylonia, had, broken, out, darius, ended, the, elamite, revolt, when, the, revolutionary, leader, aschina, was, captured, and, executed, in, susa, after, three, months, the, revolt, in, babylonia, had, ended, while, in, babylonia, darius, learned, a, revolution, had, broken, out, in, bactria, a, satrapy, which, had, always, been, in, favour, of, darius, and, had, initially, volunteered, an, army, of, soldiers, to, quell, revolts, following, this, revolts, broke, out, in, persis, the, homeland, of, the, persians, and, darius, and, then, in, elam, and, babylonia, followed, by, in, media, parthia, assyria, and, egypt, by, 522, bce, there, were, revolts, against, darius, in, most, parts, of, the, achaemenid, empire, leaving, the, empire, in, turmoil, even, though, darius, did, not, seem, to, have, the, support, of, the, populace, darius, had, a, loyal, army, led, by, close, confidants, and, nobles, including, the, six, nobles, who, had, helped, him, remove, gaumata, with, their, support, darius, was, able, to, suppress, and, quell, all, revolts, within, a, year, in, darius, s, words, he, had, killed, a, total, of, nine, lying, kings, through, the, quelling, of, revolutions, darius, left, a, detailed, account, of, these, revolutions, in, the, behistun, inscription, one, of, the, significant, events, of, darius, s, early, reign, was, the, slaying, of, intaphernes, one, of, the, seven, noblemen, who, had, deposed, the, previous, ruler, and, installed, darius, as, the, new, monarch, the, seven, had, made, an, agreement, that, they, could, all, visit, the, new, king, whenever, they, pleased, except, when, he, was, with, a, woman, one, evening, intaphernes, went, to, the, palace, to, meet, darius, but, was, stopped, by, two, officers, who, stated, that, darius, was, with, a, woman, becoming, enraged, and, insulted, intaphernes, drew, his, sword, and, cut, off, the, ears, and, noses, of, the, two, officers, while, leaving, the, palace, he, took, the, bridle, from, his, horse, and, tied, the, two, officers, together, the, officers, went, to, the, king, and, showed, him, what, intaphernes, had, done, to, them, darius, began, to, fear, for, his, own, safety, he, thought, that, all, seven, noblemen, had, banded, together, to, rebel, against, him, and, that, the, attack, against, his, officers, was, the, first, sign, of, revolt, he, sent, a, messenger, to, each, of, the, noblemen, asking, them, if, they, approved, of, intaphernes, s, actions, they, denied, and, disavowed, any, connection, with, intaphernes, s, actions, stating, that, they, stood, by, their, decision, to, appoint, darius, as, king, of, kings, darius, s, choice, to, ask, the, noblemen, indicates, that, he, was, not, yet, completely, sure, of, his, authority, taking, precautions, against, further, resistance, darius, sent, soldiers, to, seize, intaphernes, along, with, his, son, family, members, relatives, and, any, friends, who, were, capable, of, arming, themselves, darius, believed, that, intaphernes, was, planning, a, rebellion, but, when, he, was, brought, to, the, court, there, was, no, proof, of, any, such, plan, nonetheless, darius, killed, intaphernes, s, entire, family, excluding, his, wife, s, brother, and, son, she, was, asked, to, choose, between, her, brother, and, son, she, chose, her, brother, to, live, her, reasoning, for, doing, so, was, that, she, could, have, another, husband, and, another, son, but, she, would, always, have, but, one, brother, darius, was, impressed, by, her, response, and, spared, both, her, brother, s, and, her, son, s, life, after, securing, his, authority, over, the, entire, empire, darius, embarked, on, a, campaign, to, egypt, where, he, defeated, the, armies, of, the, pharaoh, and, secured, the, lands, that, cambyses, had, conquered, while, incorporating, a, large, portion, of, egypt, into, the, achaemenid, empire, through, another, series, of, campaigns, darius, i, would, eventually, reign, over, the, territorial, apex, of, the, empire, when, it, stretched, from, parts, of, the, balkans, thrace, macedonia, bulgaria, paeonia, in, the, west, to, the, indus, valley, in, the, east, in, 516, bce, darius, embarked, on, a, campaign, to, central, asia, aria, and, bactria, and, then, marched, into, afghanistan, to, taxila, in, modern, day, pakistan, darius, spent, the, winter, of, 516, 515, bce, in, gandhara, preparing, to, conquer, the, indus, valley, darius, conquered, the, lands, surrounding, the, indus, river, in, 515, bce, darius, i, controlled, the, indus, valley, from, gandhara, to, modern, karachi, and, appointed, the, greek, scylax, of, caryanda, to, explore, the, indian, ocean, from, the, mouth, of, the, indus, to, suez, darius, then, marched, through, the, bolan, pass, and, returned, through, arachosia, and, drangiana, back, to, persia, after, bardiya, was, murdered, widespread, revolts, occurred, throughout, the, empire, especially, on, the, eastern, side, darius, asserted, his, position, as, king, by, force, taking, his, armies, throughout, the, empire, suppressing, each, revolt, individually, the, most, notable, of, all, these, revolts, was, the, babylonian, revolt, which, was, led, by, nebuchadnezzar, iii, this, revolt, occurred, when, otanes, withdrew, much, of, the, army, from, babylon, to, aid, darius, in, suppressing, other, revolts, darius, felt, that, the, babylonian, people, had, taken, advantage, of, him, and, deceived, him, which, resulted, in, darius, gathering, a, large, army, and, marching, to, babylon, at, babylon, darius, was, met, with, closed, gates, and, a, series, of, defences, to, keep, him, and, his, armies, out, darius, encountered, mockery, and, taunting, from, the, rebels, including, the, famous, saying, oh, yes, you, will, capture, our, city, when, mules, shall, have, foals, for, a, year, and, a, half, darius, and, his, armies, were, unable, to, retake, the, city, though, he, attempted, many, tricks, and, strategies, even, copying, that, which, cyrus, the, great, had, employed, when, he, captured, babylon, however, the, situation, changed, in, darius, s, favour, when, according, to, the, story, a, mule, owned, by, zopyrus, a, high, ranking, soldier, foaled, following, this, a, plan, was, hatched, for, zopyrus, to, pretend, to, be, a, deserter, enter, the, babylonian, camp, and, gain, the, trust, of, the, babylonians, the, plan, was, successful, and, darius, s, army, eventually, surrounded, the, city, and, overcame, the, rebels, during, this, revolt, scythian, nomads, took, advantage, of, the, disorder, and, chaos, and, invaded, persia, darius, first, finished, defeating, the, rebels, in, elam, assyria, and, babylon, and, then, attacked, the, scythian, invaders, he, pursued, the, invaders, who, led, him, to, a, marsh, there, he, found, no, known, enemies, but, an, enigmatic, scythian, tribe, the, scythians, were, a, group, of, north, iranian, nomadic, tribes, speaking, an, eastern, iranian, language, scythian, languages, who, had, invaded, media, killed, cyrus, in, battle, revolted, against, darius, and, threatened, to, disrupt, trade, between, central, asia, and, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, as, they, lived, between, the, danube, river, river, don, and, the, black, sea, darius, crossed, the, black, sea, at, the, bosphorus, straits, using, a, bridge, of, boats, darius, conquered, large, portions, of, eastern, europe, even, crossing, the, danube, to, wage, war, on, the, scythians, darius, invaded, european, scythia, in, 513, bce, where, the, scythians, evaded, darius, s, army, using, feints, and, retreating, eastwards, while, laying, waste, to, the, countryside, by, blocking, wells, intercepting, convoys, destroying, pastures, and, continuous, skirmishes, against, darius, s, army, seeking, to, fight, with, the, scythians, darius, s, army, chased, the, scythian, army, deep, into, scythian, lands, where, there, were, no, cities, to, conquer, and, no, supplies, to, forage, in, frustration, darius, sent, a, letter, to, the, scythian, ruler, idanthyrsus, to, fight, or, surrender, the, ruler, replied, that, he, would, not, stand, and, fight, with, darius, until, they, found, the, graves, of, their, fathers, and, tried, to, destroy, them, until, then, they, would, continue, their, strategy, as, they, had, no, cities, or, cultivated, lands, to, lose, despite, the, evading, tactics, of, the, scythians, darius, s, campaign, was, so, far, relatively, successful, as, presented, by, herodotus, the, tactics, used, by, the, scythians, resulted, in, the, loss, of, their, best, lands, and, of, damage, to, their, loyal, allies, this, gave, darius, the, initiative, as, he, moved, eastwards, in, the, cultivated, lands, of, the, scythians, in, eastern, europe, proper, he, remained, resupplied, by, his, fleet, and, lived, to, an, extent, off, the, land, while, moving, eastwards, in, the, european, scythian, lands, he, captured, the, large, fortified, city, of, the, budini, one, of, the, allies, of, the, scythians, and, burnt, it, darius, eventually, ordered, a, halt, at, the, banks, of, oarus, where, he, built, eight, great, forts, some, eight, miles, distant, from, each, other, no, doubt, as, a, frontier, defence, in, his, histories, herodotus, states, that, the, ruins, of, the, forts, were, still, standing, in, his, day, after, chasing, the, scythians, for, a, month, darius, s, army, was, suffering, losses, due, to, fatigue, privation, and, sickness, concerned, about, losing, more, of, his, troops, darius, halted, the, march, at, the, banks, of, the, volga, river, and, headed, towards, thrace, he, had, conquered, enough, scythian, territory, to, force, the, scythians, to, respect, the, persian, forces, darius, s, european, expedition, was, a, major, event, in, his, reign, which, began, with, the, invasion, of, thrace, darius, also, conquered, many, cities, of, the, northern, aegean, paeonia, while, macedonia, submitted, voluntarily, after, the, demand, of, earth, and, water, becoming, a, vassal, kingdom, he, then, left, megabyzus, to, conquer, thrace, returning, to, sardis, to, spend, the, winter, the, greeks, living, in, asia, minor, and, some, of, the, greek, islands, had, submitted, to, persian, rule, already, by, 510, bce, nonetheless, there, were, certain, greeks, who, were, pro, persian, although, these, were, largely, based, in, athens, to, improve, greek, persian, relations, darius, opened, his, court, and, treasuries, to, those, greeks, who, wanted, to, serve, him, these, greeks, served, as, soldiers, artisans, statesmen, and, mariners, for, darius, however, the, increasing, concerns, amongst, the, greeks, over, the, strength, of, darius, s, kingdom, along, with, the, constant, interference, by, the, greeks, in, ionia, and, lydia, were, stepping, stones, towards, the, conflict, that, was, yet, to, come, between, persia, and, certain, of, the, leading, greek, city, states, when, aristagoras, organized, the, ionian, revolt, eretria, and, athens, supported, him, by, sending, ships, and, troops, to, ionia, and, by, burning, sardis, persian, military, and, naval, operations, to, quell, the, revolt, ended, in, the, persian, reoccupation, of, ionian, and, greek, islands, as, well, as, the, re, subjugation, of, thrace, and, the, conquering, of, macedonia, in, 492, bce, under, mardonius, macedon, had, been, a, vassal, kingdom, of, the, persians, since, the, late, 6th, century, bce, but, retained, autonomy, mardonius, s, 492, campaign, made, it, a, fully, subordinate, part, of, the, persian, kingdom, these, military, actions, coming, as, a, direct, response, to, the, revolt, in, ionia, were, the, beginning, of, the, first, persian, invasion, of, mainland, greece, at, the, same, time, anti, persian, parties, gained, more, power, in, athens, and, pro, persian, aristocrats, were, exiled, from, athens, and, sparta, darius, responded, by, sending, troops, led, by, his, son, in, law, across, the, hellespont, however, a, violent, storm, and, harassment, by, the, thracians, forced, the, troops, to, return, to, persia, seeking, revenge, on, athens, and, eretria, darius, assembled, another, army, of, 20, 000, men, under, his, admiral, datis, and, his, nephew, artaphernes, who, met, success, when, they, captured, eretria, and, advanced, to, marathon, in, 490, bce, at, the, battle, of, marathon, the, persian, army, was, defeated, by, a, heavily, armed, athenian, army, with, 9, 000, men, who, were, supported, by, 600, plataeans, and, 10,

persian, defeat, at, the, battle, of, marathon, darius, began, planning, another, expedition, against, the, greek, city, states, this, time, he, not, datis, would, command, the, imperial, armies, darius, had, spent, three, years, preparing, men, and, ships, for, war, when, a, revolt, broke, out, in, egypt, this, revolt, in, egypt, worsened, his, failing, health, and, prevented, the, possibility, of, his, leading, another, army, soon, afterwards, darius, died, after, thirty, days, of, suffering, through, an, unidentified, illness, partially, due, to, his, part, in, crushing, the,

from, cyrus, and, cambyses, to, do, this, darius, created, twenty, provinces, called, satrapies, or, archi, which, were, each, assigned, to, a, satrap, archon, and, specified, fixed, tributes, that, the, satrapies, were, required, to, pay, a, complete, list, is, preserved, in, the, catalogue, of, herodotus, beginning, with, ionia, and, listing, the, other, satrapies, from, west, to, east, excluding, persis, which, was, the, land, of, the, persians, and, the, only, province, which, was, not, a, conquered, land, tributes, were, paid, in, both, silver, and, gold, talents, tributes, in, silver, from, each, satrap, were, measured, with, the, babylonian, talent, those, paid, in, gold, were, measured, with, the, euboic, talent, the, total, tribute, from, the, satraps, came, to, an, amount, less, than, 15, 000, silver, talents, the, majority, of, the, satraps, were, of, persian, origin, and, were, members, of, the, royal, house, or, the, six, great, noble, families, these, satraps, were, personally, picked, by, darius, to, monitor, these, provinces, each, of, the, provinces, was, divided, into, sub, provinces, each, having, its, own, governor, who, was, chosen, either, by, the, royal, court, or, by, the, satrap, to, assess, tributes, a, commission, evaluated, the, expenses, and, revenues, of, each, satrap, to, ensure, that, one, person, did, not, gain, too, much, power, each, satrap, had, a, secretary, who, observed, the, affairs, of, the, state, and, communicated, with, darius, a, treasurer, who, safeguarded, provincial, revenues, and, a, garrison, commander, who, was, responsible, for, the, troops, additionally, royal, inspectors, who, were, the, eyes, and, ears, of, darius, completed, further, checks, on, each, satrap, the, imperial, administration, was, coordinated, by, the, chancery, with, headquarters, at, persepolis, susa, and, babylon, with, bactria, ecbatana, sardis, dascylium, and, memphis, having, branches, darius, kept, aramaic, as, the, common, language, which, soon, spread, throughout, the, empire, however, darius, gathered, a, group, of, scholars, to, create, a, separate, language, system, only, used, for, persis, and, the, persians, which, was, called, aryan, script, and, was, only, used, for, official, inscriptions, before, this, the, accomplishments, of, the, king, were, addressed, in, persian, solely, through, narration, and, hymns, and, through, the, masters, of, memory, indeed, oral, history, continued, to, play, an, important, role, throughout, the, history, of, iran, darius, introduced, a, new, universal, currency, the, daric, sometime, before, 500, bce, darius, used, the, coinage, system, as, a, transnational, currency, to, regulate, trade, and, commerce, throughout, his, empire, the, daric, was, also, recognized, beyond, the, borders, of, the, empire, in, places, such, as, celtic, central, europe, and, eastern, europe, there, were, two, types, of, darics, a, gold, daric, and, a, silver, daric, only, the, king, could, mint, gold, darics, important, generals, and, satraps, minted, silver, darics, the, latter, usually, to, recruit, greek, mercenaries, in, anatolia, the, daric, was, a, major, boost, to, international, trade, trade, goods, such, as, textiles, carpets, tools, and, metal, objects, began, to, travel, throughout, asia, europe, and, africa, to, further, improve, trade, darius, built, the, royal, road, a, postal, system, and, phoenician, based, commercial, shipping, the, daric, also, improved, government, revenues, as, the, introduction, of, the, daric, made, it, easier, to, collect, new, taxes, on, land, livestock, and, marketplaces, this, led, to, the, registration, of, land, which, was, measured, and, then, taxed, the, increased, government, revenues, helped, maintain, and, improve, existing, infrastructure, and, helped, fund, irrigation, projects, in, dry, lands, this, new, tax, system, also, led, to, the, formation, of, state, banking, and, the, creation, of, banking, firms, one, of, the, most, famous, banking, firms, was, murashu, sons, based, in, the, babylonian, city, of, nippur, these, banking, firms, provided, loans, and, credit, to, clients, in, an, effort, to, further, improve, trade, darius, built, canals, underground, waterways, and, a, powerful, navy, according, to, herodotus, qanat, irrigation, technology, was, introduced, to, egypt, which, is, supported, by, the, historian, albert, t, olmstead, he, further, improved, and, expanded, the, network, of, roads, and, way, stations, throughout, the, empire, so, that, there, was, a, system, of, travel, authorization, for, the, king, satraps, and, other, high, officials, which, entitled, the, traveller, to, draw, provisions, at, daily, stopping, places, by, the, grace, of, ahuramazda, am, i, king, ahuramazda, has, granted, me, the, kingdom, darius, on, the, behistun, inscription, while, there, is, no, general, consensus, in, scholarship, whether, darius, and, his, predecessors, had, been, influenced, by, zoroastrianism, it, is, well, established, that, darius, was, a, firm, believer, in, ahura, mazda, whom, he, saw, as, the, supreme, deity, however, ahura, mazda, was, also, worshipped, by, adherents, of, the, indo, iranian, religious, tradition, as, can, be, seen, at, the, behistun, inscription, darius, believed, that, ahura, mazda, had, appointed, him, to, rule, the, achaemenid, empire, darius, had, dualistic, philosophical, convictions, and, believed, that, each, rebellion, in, his, kingdom, was, the, work, of, druj, the, enemy, of, asha, darius, believed, that, because, he, lived, righteously, by, asha, ahura, mazda, supported, him, in, many, cuneiform, inscriptions, denoting, his, achievements, he, presents, himself, as, a, devout, believer, perhaps, even, convinced, that, he, had, a, divine, right, to, rule, over, the, world, however, his, relationship, with, the, deity, was, far, more, complex, in, one, inscription, he, writes, ahura, mazda, is, mine, i, am, ahura, mazda, s, in, the, lands, that, were, conquered, by, his, empire, darius, followed, the, same, achaemenid, tolerance, that, cyrus, had, shown, and, later, achaemenid, kings, would, show, he, supported, faiths, and, religions, that, were, alien, as, long, as, the, adherents, were, submissive, and, peaceable, sometimes, giving, them, grants, from, his, treasury, for, their, purposes, he, had, funded, the, restoration, of, the, israelite, temple, which, had, originally, been, decreed, by, cyrus, was, supportive, towards, greek, cults, which, can, be, seen, in, his, letter, to, gadatas, and, supported, elamite, priests, he, had, also, observed, egyptian, religious, rites, related, to, kingship, and, had, built, the, temple, for, the, egyptian, god, amun, during, darius, s, greek, expedition, he, had, begun, construction, projects, in, susa, egypt, and, persepolis, he, had, linked, the, red, sea, to, the, river, nile, by, building, a, canal, darius, canal, which, ran, from, modern, zaq, z, q, to, modern, suez, to, open, this, canal, he, travelled, to, egypt, in, 497, bce, where, the, inauguration, was, carried, out, with, great, fanfare, and, celebration, darius, also, built, a, canal, to, connect, the, red, sea, and, mediterranean, on, this, visit, to, egypt, he, erected, monuments, and, executed, aryandes, on, the, charge, of, treason, when, darius, returned, to, persis, he, found, that, the, codification, of, egyptian, law, had, been, finished, additionally, darius, sponsored, large, construction, projects, in, susa, babylon, egypt, and, persepolis, in, susa, darius, built, a, new, palace, complex, in, the, north, of, the, city, an, inscription, states, that, the, palace, was, destroyed, during, the, reign, of, artaxerxes, i, but, was, rebuilt, today, only, glazed, bricks, of, the, palace, remain, the, majority, of, them, in, the, louvre, in, pasargadae, darius, finished, all, incomplete, construction, projects, from, the, reign, of, cyrus, the, great, a, palace, was, also, built, during, the, reign, of, darius, with, an, inscription, in, the, name, of, cyrus, the, great, it, was, previously, believed, that, cyrus, had, constructed, this, building, however, due, to, the, cuneiform, script, being, used, the, palace, is, believed, to, have, been, constructed, by, darius, in, egypt, darius, built, many, temples, and, restored, those, that, had, previously, been, destroyed, even, though, darius, was, a, believer, of, ahura, mazda, he, built, temples, dedicated, to, the, gods, of, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, several, temples, found, were, dedicated, to, ptah, and, nekhbet, darius, also, created, several, roads, and, routes, in, egypt, the, monuments, that, darius, built, were, often, inscribed, in, the, official, languages, of, the, persian, empire, old, persian, elamite, and, babylonian, and, egyptian, hieroglyphs, to, construct, these, monuments, darius, employed, a, large, number, of, workers, and, artisans, of, diverse, nationalities, several, of, these, workers, were, deportees, who, had, been, employed, specifically, for, these, projects, these, deportees, enhanced, the, empire, s, economy, and, improved, inter, cultural, relations, at, the, time, of, darius, s, death, construction, projects, were, still, under, way, xerxes, completed, these, works, and, in, some, cases,
