dennis, macalistair, ritchie, september, 9, 1941, c, october, 12, 2011, was, an, american, computer, scientist, he, created, the, c, programming, language, and, with, long, time, colleague, ken, thompson, the, unix, operating, system, and, b, language, ritchie, and, thompson, were, awarded, the, turing, award, from, the, association, for, computing, machinery, acm, in, 1983, the, ieee, richard, w, hamming, medal, from, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, in, 1990, and, the, national, medal, of, technology, from, president, bill, clinton, in, 1999, ritchie, was, the, head, of, lucent, technologies, system, software, research, department, when, he, retired, in, 2007, dennis, ritchie, was, born, in, bronxville, new, york, his, father, was, alistair, e, ritchie, a, longtime, bell, labs, scientist, and, co, author, of, the, design, of, switching, circuits, on, switching, circuit, theory, as, a, child, dennis, moved, with, his, family, to, summit, new, jersey, where, he, graduated, from, summit, high, school, he, graduated, from, harvard, university, with, degrees, in, physics, and, applied, mathematics, in, 1963, in, 1967, ritchie, began, working, at, the, bell, labs, computing, science, research, center, in, 1968, he, defended, his, phd, thesis, on, computational, complexity, and, program, structure, at, harvard, under, the, supervision, of, patrick, c, fischer, however, ritchie, never, officially, received, his, phd, degree, as, he, did, not, submit, a, bound, copy, of, his, dissertation, to, the, harvard, library, a, requirement, for, the, degree, in, 2020, the, computer, history, museum, worked, with, ritchie, s, family, and, fischer, s, family, and, found, a, copy, of, the, lost, dissertation, during, the, 1960s, ritchie, and, ken, thompson, worked, on, the, multics, operating, system, at, bell, labs, thompson, then, found, an, old, pdp, 7, machine, and, developed, his, own, application, programs, and, operating, system, from, scratch, aided, by, ritchie, and, others, in, 1970, brian, kernighan, suggested, the, name, unix, a, pun, on, the, name, multics, to, supplement, assembly, language, with, a, system, level, programming, language, thompson, created, b, later, b, was, replaced, by, c, created, by, ritchie, who, continued, to, contribute, to, the, development, of, unix, and, c, for, many, years, during, the, 1970s, ritchie, collaborated, with, james, reeds, and, robert, morris, on, a, ciphertext, only, attack, on, the, m, 209, us, cipher, machine, that, could, solve, messages, of, at, least, 2000, 2500, letters, ritchie, relates, that, after, discussions, with, the, national, security, agency, the, authors, decided, not, to, publish, it, as, they, were, told, that, the, principle, applied, to, machines, still, in, use, by, foreign, governments, ritchie, was, also, involved, with, the, development, of, the, operating, systems, plan, 9, and, inferno, and, the, programming, language, limbo, as, part, of, an, at, t, restructuring, in, the, mid, 1990s, ritchie, was, transferred, to, lucent, technologies, where, he, retired, in, 2007, as, head, of, system, software, research, department, ritchie, created, the, c, programming, language, and, was, one, of, the, developers, of, the, unix, operating, system, with, brian, kernighan, he, co, wrote, the, book, the, c, programming, language, which, is, often, referred, to, as, k, r, after, their, initials, ritchie, worked, together, with, ken, thompson, who, is, credited, with, writing, the, original, version, of, unix, one, of, ritchie, s, contributions, to, unix, was, its, porting, to, different, machines, and, platforms, they, were, so, influential, on, research, unix, that, doug, mcilroy, later, wrote, the, names, of, ritchie, and, thompson, may, safely, be, assumed, to, be, attached, to, almost, everything, not, otherwise, attributed, nowadays, the, c, language, is, widely, used, in, application, operating, system, and, embedded, system, development, and, its, influence, is, seen, in, most, modern, programming, languages, c, is, a, low, level, language, with, constructs, closely, translating, to, the, hardware, s, instruction, set, however, it, is, not, tied, to, any, given, hardware, making, it, easy, to, write, programs, on, any, machine, that, supports, c, moreover, c, is, a, high, level, programming, language, with, constructs, mapping, to, data, structures, in, application, software, c, influenced, several, other, languages, and, derivatives, such, as, c, objective, c, used, by, apple, c, used, by, microsoft, and, java, used, in, corporate, environments, extensively, and, by, android, ritchie, and, thompson, used, c, to, write, unix, which, has, been, influential, in, establishing, many, computing, concepts, and, principles, that, are, adopted, widely, in, an, interview, from, 1999, ritchie, clarified, that, he, saw, linux, and, berkeley, software, distribution, bsd, operating, systems, as, a, continuation, of, the, basis, of, the, unix, operating, system, and, as, derivatives, of, unix, i, think, the, linux, phenomenon, is, quite, delightful, because, it, draws, so, strongly, on, the, basis, that, unix, provided, linux, seems, to, be, among, the, healthiest, of, the, direct, unix, derivatives, though, there, are, also, the, various, bsd, systems, as, well, as, the, more, official, offerings, from, the, workstation, and, mainframe, manufacturers, in, the, same, interview, he, stated, that, he, viewed, unix, and, linux, as, the, continuation, of, ideas, that, were, started, by, ken, and, me, and, many, others, many, years, ago, in, 1983, ritchie, and, thompson, received, the, turing, award, for, their, development, of, generic, operating, systems, theory, and, specifically, for, the, implementation, of, the, unix, operating, system, ritchie, s, turing, award, lecture, was, titled, reflections, on, software, research, in, 1990, both, ritchie, and, thompson, received, the, ieee, richard, w, hamming, medal, from, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, for, the, origination, of, the, unix, operating, system, and, the, c, programming, language, in, 1997, both, ritchie, and, thompson, were, made, fellows, of, the, computer, history, museum, for, co, creation, of, the, unix, operating, system, and, for, development, of, the, c, programming, language, on, april, 21, 1999, thompson, and, ritchie, jointly, received, the, national, medal, of, technology, of, 1998, from, president, bill, clinton, for, co, inventing, the, unix, operating, system, and, the, c, programming, language, which, according, to, the, citation, for, the, medal, led, to, enormous, advances, in, computer, hardware, software, and, networking, systems, and, stimulated, growth, of, an, entire, industry, thereby, enhancing, american, leadership, in, the, information, age, in, 2005, the, industrial, research, institute, awarded, ritchie, its, achievement, award, in, recognition, of, his, contribution, to, science, and, technology, and, to, society, generally, with, his, development, of, the, unix, operating, system, in, 2011, ritchie, along, with, thompson, was, awarded, the, japan, prize, for, information, and, communications, for, his, work, in, the, development, of, the, unix, operating, system, ritchie, was, found, dead, on, october, 12, 2011, at, the, age, of, 70, at, his, home, in, berkeley, heights, new, jersey, where, he, lived, alone, first, news, of, his, death, came, from, his, former, colleague, rob, pike, he, had, been, in, frail, health, for, several, years, following, treatment, for, prostate, cancer, and, heart, disease, news, of, ritchie, s, death, was, largely, overshadowed, by, the, media, coverage, of, the, death, of, apple, co, founder, steve, jobs, which, occurred, the, week, before, following, ritchie, s, death, computer, historian, paul, e, ceruzzi, stated, ritchie, was, under, the, radar, his, name, was, not, a, household, name, at, all, but, if, you, had, a, microscope, and, could, look, in, a, computer, you, d, see, his, work, everywhere, inside, in, an, interview, shortly, after, ritchie, s, death, long, time, colleague, brian, kernighan, said, ritchie, never, expected, c, to, be, so, significant, kernighan, told, the, new, york, times, the, tools, that, dennis, built, and, their, direct, descendants, run, pretty, much, everything, today, kernighan, reminded, readers, of, how, important, a, role, c, and, unix, had, played, in, the, development, of, later, high, profile, projects, such, as, the, iphone, other, testimonials, to, his, influence, followed, reflecting, upon, his, death, a, commentator, compared, the, relative, importance, of, steve, jobs, and, ritchie, concluding, that, work, played, a, key, role, in, spawning, the, technological, revolution, of, the, last, forty, years, including, technology, on, which, apple, went, on, to, build, its, fortune, another, commentator, said, ritchie, on, the, other, hand, invented, and, co, invented, two, key, software, technologies, which, make, up, the, dna, of, effectively, every, single, computer, software, product, we, use, directly, or, even, indirectly, in, the, modern, age, it, sounds, like, a, wild, claim, but, it, really, is, true, another, said, many, in, computer, science, and, related, fields, knew, of, ritchie, s, importance, to, the, growth, and, development, of, well, everything, to, do, with, computing, the, fedora, 16, linux, distribution, which, was, released, about, a, month, after, he, died, was, dedicated, to, his, memory, freebsd, 9, 0, released, january, 12, 2012, was, also, dedicated, in, his, memory, asteroid, 294727, dennisritchie, discovered, by, astronomers, tom, glinos, and, david, h, levy, in, 2008, was, named, in, his, memory, the, official, naming, citation, was, published, by, the, minor, planet, center, on, 7, february, 2012, minor, planet, circulars, m, p, c, 78272, ritchie, has, been, the, author, or, contributor, to, about, 50, academic, papers, books, and, textbooks, and, which, have, had, over, 15, 000, citations, here, are, some, of, his, most, cited, works
