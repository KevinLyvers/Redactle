according, to, dreyer, 2007, the, nature, of, the, emperor, s, words, indicated, that, zheng, he, s, behaviour, in, the, situation, was, the, last, straw, but, there, is, too, little, information,

chinese, presence, and, impose, imperial, control, over, the, indian, ocean, trade, impress, foreign, peoples, in, the, indian, ocean, basin, and, extend, the, empire, s, tributary, system, it, has, also, been, inferred, from, passages, in, the, history, of, ming, that, the, initial, voyages, were, launched, as, part, of, the, emperor, s, attempt, to, capture, his, escaped, predecessor, which, would, have, made, the, first, voyage, the, largest, scale, manhunt, on, water, in, the, history, of, china, zheng, he, was, placed, as, the, admiral, in, control, of, the, huge, fleet, and, armed,

giraffe, that, he, brought, back, from, malindi, was, considered, to, be, a, qilin, and, taken, as, proof, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, upon, the, administration, the, daxuexi, alley, mosque, in, xi, an, has, a, stele, dating, to, january, 1523, inscribed, with, zheng, he, s, fourth, maritime, voyage, to, tianfang, arabian, peninsula, while, zheng, he, s, fleet, was, unprecedented, the, routes, were, not, his, fleet, followed, long, established, well, mapped, routes, of, trade, between, china, and, the, arabian, peninsula, that, had, been, used, since, at, least, the, han, dynasty, that, fact, along, with, the, use, of, a, more, than, abundant, number, of, crew, members, who, were, regular, military, personnel, leads, some, to, speculate, that, the, expeditions, may, have, been, geared, at, least, partially, at, spreading, china, s, power, through, expansion, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, the, king, of, wu, sent, a, 20, year, diplomatic, mission, led, by, zhu, ying, and, kang, tai, along, the, coast, of, asia, which, reached, as, far, as, the, eastern, roman, empire, after, centuries, of, disruption, the, song, dynasty, restored, large, scale, maritime, trade, from, china, in, the, south, pacific, and, indian, oceans, and, reached, as, far, as, the, arabian, peninsula, and, east, africa, when, his, fleet, first, arrived, at, malacca, there, was, already, a, sizable, chinese, community, the, general, survey, of, the, ocean, shores, y, ngy, sh, ngl, n, composed, by, the, translator, ma, huan, in, 1416, gives, very, detailed, accounts, of, his, observations, of, people, s, customs, and, lives, in, the, ports, that, they, visited, he, referred, to, the, expatriate, chinese, as, tang, people, t, ngr, n, the, fleet, did, not, engage, in, conquest, or, colonization, though, it, included, troops, their, purpose, was, to, demonstrate, the, middle, kingdom, s, strength, 48, however, a, contemporary, reported, that, zheng, he, walked, like, a, tiger, and, did, not, shrink, from, violence, when, he, considered, it, necessary, to, impress, foreign, peoples, with, china, s, military, might, he, ruthlessly, suppressed, pirates, who, had, long, plagued, chinese, and, southeast, asian, waters, for, example, he, defeated, chen, zuyi, one, of, the, most, feared, and, respected, pirate, captains, and, returned, him, to, china, for, execution, he, also, waged, a, land, war, against, the, kingdom, of, kotte, on, ceylon, and, he, made, displays, of, military, force, when, local, officials, threatened, his, fleet, in, arabia, and, east, africa, from, his, fourth, voyage, he, brought, envoys, from, 30, states, who, traveled, to, china, and, paid, their, respects, at, the, ming, court, in, 1424, the, yongle, emperor, died, his,

1426, 1435, but, the, voyages, of, the, chinese, treasure, ship, fleets, then, ended, xuande, believed, his, father, s, decision, to, halt, the, voyages, had, been, meritorious, and, thus, there, would, be, no, need, to, make, a, detailed, description, of, his, grandfather, s, sending, zheng, he, to, the, western, ocean, the, voyages, were, contrary, to, the, rules, stipulated, in, the, huang, ming, zuxun, the, dynastic, foundation, documents, laid, down, by, the, hongwu, emperor, some, far, off, countries, pay, their, tribute, to, me, at, much, expense, and, through, great, difficulties, all, of, which, are, by, no, means, my, own, wish, messages, should, be, forwarded, to, them, to, reduce, their, tribute, so, as, to, avoid, high, and, unnecessary, expenses, on, both, sides, they, further, violated, longstanding, confucian, principles, they, were, only, made, possible, by, and, therefore, continued, to, represent, a, triumph, of, the, ming, s, eunuch, faction, over, the, administration, s, scholar, bureaucrats, upon, zheng, he, s, death, and, his, faction, s, fall, from, power, his, successors, sought, to, minimize, him, in, official, accounts, along, with, continuing, attempts, to, destroy, all, records, related, to, the, jianwen, emperor, or, the, manhunt, to, find, him, although, unmentioned, in, the, official, dynastic, histories, zheng, he, probably, died, during, the, treasure, fleet, s, last, voyage, although, he, has, a, tomb, in, china, it, is, empty, since, he, was, buried, at, sea, zheng, he, led, seven, expeditions, to, the, western, or, indian, ocean, zheng, he, brought, back, to, china, many, trophies, and, envoys, from, more, than, thirty, kingdoms, including, king, vira, alakeshwara, of, ceylon, who, came, to, china, as, a, captive, to, apologize, to, the, emperor, for, offenses, against, his, mission, zheng, he, wrote, of, his, travels, we, have, traversed, more, than, 100, 000, li, of, immense, water, spaces, and, have, beheld, in, the, ocean, huge, waves, like, mountains, rising, in, the, sky, and, we, have, set, eyes, on, barbarian, regions, far, away, hidden, in, a, blue, transparency, of, light, vapors, while, our, sails, loftily, unfurled, like, clouds, day, and, night, continued, their, course, as, a, star, traversing, those, savage, waves, as, if, we, were, treading, a, public, thoroughfare, zheng, he, s, sailing, charts, the, mao, kun, map, were, published, in, a, book, entitled, the, wubei, zhi, a, treatise, on, armament, technology, written, in, 1621, and, published, in, 1628, but, traced, back, to, zheng, he, s, and, earlier, voyages, it, was, originally, a, strip, map, 20, 5, cm, by, 560, cm, that, could, be, rolled, up, but, was, divided, into, 40, pages, which, vary, in, scale, from, 7, miles, inch, in, the, nanjing, area, to, 215, miles, inch, in, parts, of, the, african, coast, investigation, into, folios, 19v, to, 20r, of, the, mao, kun, map, which, cover, the, indian, ocean, including, south, india, sri, lanka, the, maldives, and, east, africa, suggests, that, the, map, is, a, composite, of, four, maps, one, for, sri, lanka, one, for, south, india, one, for, the, maldives, and, one, for, around, 400, km, of, the, east, african, coast, no, further, south, than, 6, degrees, south, of, the, equator, each, of, these, maps, is, positioned, at, a, different, orientation, to, fit, with, the, ocean, currents, and, winds, required, of, a, sailing, chart, rather, than, a, formal, map, the, analysis, also, suggests, that, arabic, speaking, pilots, with, a, detailed, knowledge, of, the, african, coast, were, involved, in, the, cartography, there, is, little, attempt, to, provide, an, accurate, 2, d, representation, instead, the, sailing, instructions, are, given, using, a, 24, point, compass, system, with, a, chinese, symbol, for, each, point, together, with, a, sailing, time, or, distance, which, takes, account, of, the, local, currents, and, winds, sometimes, depth, soundings, are, also, provided, it, also, shows, bays, estuaries, capes, and, islands, ports, and, mountains, along, the, coast, important, landmarks, such, as, pagodas, and, temples, and, shoal, rocks, of, 300, named, places, outside, china, more, than, 80, can, be, confidently, located, there, are, also, fifty, observations, of, stellar, altitude,

fleets, thought, to, be, of, comparable, size, marco, polo, and, ibn, battuta, both, described, multi, masted, ships, carrying, 500, to, 1, 000, passengers, in, their, translated, accounts, niccol, de, conti, a, contemporary, of, zheng, he, was, also, an, eyewitness, of, ships, in, southeast, asia, claiming, to, have, seen, five, masted, junks, weighing, about, 2, 000, vegetes, that, is,

were, 19th, century, steamers, with, iron, hulls, many, scholars, consider, it, unlikely, that, any, of, zheng, he, s, ships, were, 135, m, 450, ft, in, length, and, have, proposed, much, shorter, lengths, as, low, as, 60, 75, m, 200, 250, ft, zhao, zhigang, claimed, that, he, has, solved, the, debate, of, the, size, difference, and, stated, that, zheng, he, s, largest, ship, was, about, 70, m, 230, ft, in, length, edward, l, dreyer, claims, that, luo, maodeng, s, novel, is, unsuitable, as, historical, evidence, the, novel, contains, a, number, of, fantasy, element, for, example, the, ships, were, constructed, with, divine, help, by, the, immortal, lu, ban, one, explanation, for, the, seemingly, inefficient, size, of, the, colossal, ships, was, that, the, 44, zhang, treasure, ships, were, used, only, by, the, emperor, and, imperial, bureaucrats, to, travel, along, the, yangtze, for, court, business, including, reviewing, zheng, he, s, expedition, fleet, the, yangtze, river, with, its, calmer, waters, may, have, been, navigable, by, these, treasure, ships, zheng, he, a, court, eunuch, would, not, have, had, the, privilege, in, rank, to, command, the, largest, of, the, ships, seaworthy, or, not, the, main, ships, of, zheng, he, s, fleet, were, instead, six, masted, 2000, liao, ships, that, would, give, burthen, of, 500, tons, and, a, displacement, tonnage, of, about, 800, tons, traditional, and, popular, accounts, of, zheng, he, s, voyages, have, described, a, great, fleet, of, gigantic, ships, far, larger, than, any, other, wooden, ships, in, history, the, most, grandiose, claims, for, zheng, he, s, 1405, fleet, are, entirely, based, on, a, calculation, derived, from, an, account, that, was, written, three, centuries, later, and, was, accepted, as, fact, by, one, modern, writer, rejected, by, numerous, naval, experts, 128, there, are, even, some, sources, that, claim, some, of, the, treasure, ships, might, have, been, as, long, as, 183, m, 600, ft, the, claims, that, the, chinese, treasure, ships, reached, such, size, is, disputed, because, other, 17th, century, ming, records, stated, that, european, east, indiamen, and, galleons, were, 30, 40, 50, and, 60, zhang, 90, 120, 150, and, 180, m, in, length, it, is, also, possible, that, the, measure, of, zhang, used, in, the, conversions, was, mistaken, the, length, of, a, dutch, ship, recorded, in, the, history, of, ming, was, 30, zhang, if, the, zhang, is, taken, to, be, 3, 2, m, the, dutch, ship, would, be, 96, m, long, also, the, dutch, hongyi, cannon, was, recorded, to, be, more, than, 2, zhang, 6, 4, m, long, comparative, study, by, hu, xiaowei, 2018, concluded, that, 1, zhang, would, be, equal, to, 1, 5, 1, 6, m, this, means, the, dutch, ship, would, be, 45, 48, m, long, and, the, cannon, would, be, 3, 3, 2, m, long, taking, 1, 6, m, for, 1, zhang, zheng, he, s, 44, zhang, treasure, ship, would, be, 70, 4, m, 230, 97, ft, long, and, 28, 8, m, 94, 49, ft, wide, or, 22, zhang, long, and, 9, zhang, wide, if, the, zhang, is, taken, to, be, 3, 2, m, it, is, known, that, the, measure, unit, during, the, ming, era, was, not, unified, a, measurement, of, east, and, west, pagoda, in, quanzhou, resulted, in, a, zhang, unit, of, 2, 5, 2, 56, m, according, to, chen, cunren, one, zhang, in, the, ming, dynasty, is, only, half, a, zhang, in, modern, times, from, 2003, to, 2004, the, treasure, shipyard, was, excavated, in, northwestern, nanjing, the, former, capital, of, the, ming, dynasty, near, the, yangtze, river, despite, the, site, being, referred, to, as, the, longjiang, treasure, shipyard, in, the, official, names, the, site, is, distinct, from, the, actual, longjiang, shipyard, which, was, located, on, a, different, site, and, produced, different, types, of, ships, the, treasure, shipyard, where, zheng, he, s, fleet, is, believed, to, have, been, built, in, the, ming, dynasty, once, consisted, of, thirteen, basins, based, on, a, 1944, map, most, of, which, have, now, been, covered, by, the, construction, of, buildings, in, the, 20th, century, the, basins, are, believed, to, have, been, connected, to, the, yangtze, via, a, series, of, gates, three, long, basins, survive, each, with, wooden, structures, inside, interpreted, to, be, frames, onto, which, the, ships, to, be, built, on, the, largest, basin, extends, for, a, length, of, 421, metres, 1, 381, ft, while, they, were, long, enough, to, accommodate, the, largest, claimed, zheng, he, treasure, ship, they, were, not, wide, enough, to, fit, even, a, ship, half, the, claimed, size, the, basin, was, only, 41, metres, 135, ft, wide, at, most, with, only, a, 10, metres, 33, ft, width, showing, evidence, of, structures, they, were, also, not, deep, enough, being, only, 4, metres, 13, ft, deep, other, remains, of, ships, in, the, site, indicate, that, the, ships, were, only, slightly, larger, than, the, frames, that, supported, them, moreover, the, basin, structures, were, grouped, into, clusters, with, large, gaps, between, them, if, each, cluster, was, interpreted, as, a, ship, framework, then, the, largest, ship, would, not, exceed, 75, metres, 246, ft, at, most, probably, less, the, 2003, 2004, excavation, also, recovered, two, complete, wooden, rudderposts, from, the, treasure, shipyard, in, addition, to, another, recovered, in, 1957, they, are, made, of, teak, and, measure, around, 10, to, 11, metres, 33, to, 36, ft, in, length, zhou, shide, 1962, claimed, that, the, first, rudderpost, recovered, was, proof, of, the, enormous, dimensions, of, the, ships, based, on, his, calculations, on, how, big, the, rudderblade, would, be, however, church, 2010, points, out, that, zhou, was, using, calculations, based, on, modern, steel, propeller, driven, ships, not, wooden, ships, as, well, as, the, fact, that, zhou, s, hypothetical, rudder, shape, was, based, on, the, flat, bottomed, shachuan, ship, type, not, the, sea, going, fuchuan, the, rudderposts, cannot, be, used, to, infer, the, actual, size, of, the, rudder, blades, church, notes, that, in, traditional, wooden, chinese, ships, rudderposts, were, necessarily, long, in, order, for, them, to, extend, from, the, water, level, up, unto, the, ship, deck, where, it, was, controlled, by, the, tiller, church, compares, it, with, modern, wooden, junks, built, in, the, traditional, l, meimao, green, eyebrow, style, which, also, have, rudderposts, that, are, 11, metres, 36, ft, long, but, are, only, 31, metres, 102, ft, in, overall, length, one, theory, is, that, admiral, zheng, he, died, in, 1433, during, or, shortly, after, his, seventh, voyage, another, is, that, zheng, he, continued, to, serve, as, the, defender, of, nanjing, and, died, in, 1435, a, tomb, was, built, for, zheng, he, at, the, southern, slope, of, cattle, head, hill, nanjing, the, original, tomb, was, a, horseshoe, shaped, grave, it, is, a, cenotaph, believed, to, contain, his, clothes, and, headgear, in, 1985, the, tomb, was, rebuilt, following, a, muslim, style, zheng, s, voyages, were, long, neglected, in, official, chinese, histories, but, have, become, well, known, in, china, and, abroad, since, the, publication, of, liang, qichao, s, biography, of, our, homeland, s, great, navigator, zheng, he, in, 1904, in, the, decades, after, the, last, voyage, imperial, officials, minimized, the, importance, of, zheng, he, and, his, expeditions, throughout, the, many, regnal, and, dynastic, histories, they, compiled, the, information, in, the, yongle, and, xuande, emperors, official, annals, was, incomplete, and, even, erroneous, and, other, official, publications, omitted, them, completely, although, some, have, seen, that, as, a, conspiracy, seeking, to, eliminate, memories, of, the, voyages, it, is, likely, that, the, records, were, dispersed, throughout, several, departments, and, the, expeditions, unauthorized, by, and, in, fact, counter, to, the, injunctions, of, the, dynastic, founder, presented, a, kind, of, embarrassment, to, the, dynasty, state, sponsored, ming, naval, efforts, declined, dramatically, after, zheng, s, voyages, starting, in, the, early, 15th, century, china, experienced, increasing, pressure, from, the, surviving, yuan, mongols, from, the, north, the, relocation, of, the, capital, to, beijing, in, the, north, exacerbated, this, threat, dramatically, at, considerable, expense, china, launched, annual, military, expeditions, from, beijing, to, weaken, the, mongolians, the, expenditures, necessary, for, the, land, campaigns, directly, competed, with, the, funds, necessary, to, continue, naval, expeditions, further, in, 1449, mongolian, cavalry, ambushed, a, land, expedition, personally, led, by, the, zhengtong, emperor, at, tumu, fortress, less, than, a, day, s, march, from, the, walls, of, the, capital, the, mongolians, wiped, out, the, chinese, army, and, captured, the, emperor, the, battle, had, two, salient, effects, firstly, it, demonstrated, the, clear, threat, posed, by, the, northern, nomads, secondly, the, mongols, caused, a, political, crisis, in, china, when, they, released, the, emperor, after, his, half, brother, had, already, ascended, and, declared, the, new, jingtai, era, not, until, 1457, and, the, restoration, of, the, former, emperor, would, political, stability, return, upon, his, return, to, power, china, abandoned, the, strategy, of, annual, land, expeditions, and, instead, embarked, upon, a, massive, and, expensive, expansion, of, the, great, wall, of, china, in, that, environment, funding, for, naval, expeditions, was, simply, absent, however, missions, from, southeastern, asia, continued, to, arrive, for, decades, depending, on, local, conditions, they, could, reach, such, frequency, that, the, court, found, it, necessary, to, restrict, them, the, history, of, ming, records, imperial, edicts, forbade, java, champa, and, siam, from, sending, their, envoys, more, often, than, once, every, three, years, among, the, chinese, diaspora, in, southeast, asia, zheng, he, became, a, figure, of, folk, veneration, even, some, of, his, crew, members, who, happened, to, stay, in, some, port, sometimes, did, so, as, well, such, as, poontaokong, on, sulu, the, temples, of, the, cult, called, after, either, of, his, names, cheng, hoon, or, sam, po, are, peculiar, to, overseas, chinese, except, for, a, single, temple, in, hongjian, originally, constructed, by, a, returned, filipino, chinese, in, the, ming, dynasty, and, rebuilt, by, another, filipino, chinese, after, the, original, was, destroyed, during, the, cultural, revolution, the, oldest, and, most, important, chinese, temple, in, malacca, is, the, 17th, century, cheng, hoon, teng, dedicated, to, guanyin, during, dutch, colonial, rule, the, head, of, the, cheng, hoon, temple, was, appointed, as, chief, over, the, community, s, chinese, inhabitants, following, zheng, he, s, arrival, the,

perpatih, putih, as, his, envoy, to, china, carrying, a, letter, from, the, sultan, to, the, ming, emperor, the, letter, requested, the, hand, of, an, imperial, daughter, in, marriage, malay, but, not, chinese, annals, record, that, in, 1459, a, princess, named, hang, li, po, or, hang, liu, was, sent, from, china, to, marry, the, sultan, she, came, with, 500, high, ranking, young, men, and, a, few, hundred, handmaidens, as, her, entourage, they, eventually, settled, in, bukit, cina, it, is, believed, that, a, significant, number, of, them, married, into, the, local, populace, creating, the, descendants, now, known, as, the, peranakan, owing, to, this, supposed, lineage, the, peranakan, still, use, special, honorifics, baba, for, the, men, and, nyonya, for, the, women, the, chinese, indonesian, community, have, established, temples, dedicated, to, zheng, he, in, jakarta, cirebon, surabaya, and, semarang, in, 1961, the, indonesian, islamic, leader, and, scholar, hamka, credited, zheng, he, for, playing, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, islam, in, indonesia, the, brunei, times, credits, zheng, he, with, building, chinese, muslim, communities, in, palembang, and, along, the, shores, of, java, the, malay, peninsula, and, the, philippines, these, muslims, allegedly, followed, the, hanafi, school, in, the, chinese, language, in, the, 1950s, historians, such, as, john, fairbank, and, joseph, needham, popularized, the, idea, that, after, zheng, he, s, voyages, china, turned, away, from, the, seas, due, to, the, haijin, edict, and, was, isolated, from, european, technological, advancements, modern, historians, point, out, that, chinese, maritime, commerce, did, not, totally, stop, after, zheng, he, that, chinese, ships, continued, to, participate, in, southeast, asian, commerce, until, the, 19th, century, and, that, active, chinese, trading, with, india, and, east, africa, continued, long, after, the, time, of, zheng, moreover, revisionist, historians, such, as, jack, goldstone, argue, that, the, zheng, he, voyages, ended, for, practical, reasons, that, did, not, reflect, the, technological, level, of, china, although, the, ming, dynasty, prohibited, shipping, with, the, haijin, edict, it, was, a, policy, of, the, hongwu, emperor, that, long, preceded, zheng, he, and, the, ban, so, obviously, disregarded, by, the, yongle, emperor, was, eventually, lifted, entirely, however, the, ban, on, maritime, shipping, forced, countless, numbers, of, people, into, smuggling, and, piracy, neglect, of, the, imperial, navy, and, nanjing, dockyards, after, zheng, he, s, voyages, left, the, coast, highly, vulnerable, to, japanese, wokou, during, the, 16th, century, richard, von, glahn, a, ucla, professor, of, chinese, history, commented, that, most, treatments, of, zheng, he, present, him, wrongly, offer, counterfactual, arguments, and, emphasize, china, s, missed, opportunity, by, focusing, on, failures, instead, of, accomplishments, in, contrast, glahn, asserts, that, zheng, he, reshaped, asia, because, maritime, history, in, the, 15th, century, was, essentially, the, zheng, he, story, and, the, effects, of, his, voyages, despite, the, official, neglect, the, adventures, of, the, fleet, captured, the, imagination, of, some, chinese, with, some, writing, novelizations, of, the, voyages, such, as, the, romance, of, the, three, jeweled, eunuch, in, 1597, on, his, travels, zheng, he, built, mosques, and, also, spread, the, worship, of, mazu, he, apparently, never, found, time, for, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, but, sent, sailors, there, on, his, last, voyage, he, played, an, important, part, in, developing, relations, between, china, and, islamic, countries, zheng, he, also, visited, muslim, shrines, of,
