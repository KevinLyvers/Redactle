an, iron, will, along, with, a, powerful, sense, of, duty, and, a, dedication, to, very, hard, work, he, saw, himself, as, a, soldier, a, junior, officer, consumed, by, spit, and, polish, a, handsome, man, he, was, highly, nervous, and, aggressive, trained, as, a, military, engineer, he, was, a, stickler, for, minute, detail, in, his, public, persona, stated, riasanovsky, nicholas, i, came, to, represent, autocracy, personified, infinitely, majestic, determined, and, powerful, hard, as, stone, and, relentless, as, fate, nicholas, i, was, instrumental, in, helping, to, create, an, independent, greek, state, and, resumed, the, russian, conquest, of, the, caucasus, by, seizing, i, d, r, province, and, the, remainder, of, modern, day, armenia, and, azerbaijan, from, qajar, iran,

aided, austria, during, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, later, on, however, he, led, russia, into, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, with, disastrous, results, historians, emphasize, that, his, micromanagement, of, the, armies, hindered, his, generals, as, did, his, misguided, strategy, several, historians, have, concluded, that, the, reign, of, nicholas, i, was, a, catastrophic, failure, in, both, domestic, and, foreign, policy, on, the, eve, of, his, death, the, russian, empire, reached, its, geographical, zenith, spanning, over, 20, million, square, kilometers, 7, 7, million, square, miles, but, had, a, desperate, need, for, reform, nicholas, was, born, at, gatchina, palace, in, gatchina, the, ninth, child, of, grand, duke, paul, heir, to, the, russian, throne, and, grand, duchess, maria, feodorovna, of, russia, n, e, sophie, dorothea, of, w, rttemberg, he, had, six, older, sisters, and, two, older, brothers, namely, the, future, emperor, alexander, i, of, russia, and, grand, duke, constantine, pavlovich, of, russia, four, months, after, nicholas, s, birth, his, grandmother, catherine, the, great, died, and, his, parents, became, emperor, and, empress, of, russia, in, 1800, at, the, age, of, four, years, nicholas, was, named, grand, prior, of, russia, and, entitled, to, wear, the, maltese, cross, nicholas, grew, up, to, be, a, fine, young, man, riasanovsky, says, of, him, that, he, is, the, most, handsome, man, in, europe, but, also, a, charmer, who, enjoyed, feminine, company, and, was, often, at, his, best, with, the, men, on, 13, july, 1817, nicholas, married, princess, charlotte, of, prussia, 1798, 1860, who, took, the, name, alexandra, feodorovna, when, she, converted, to, orthodoxy, charlotte, s, parents, were, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, and, louise, of, mecklenburg, strelitz, nicholas, and, charlotte, were, third, cousins, as, they, were, both, great, great, grandchildren, of, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, with, two, older, brothers, it, initially, seemed, unlikely, nicholas, would, ever, become, tsar, however, as, alexander, and, constantine, both, failed, to, produce, legitimate, sons, nicholas, first, came, to, attention, as, being, likely, to, rule, one, day, or, at, least, that, his, children, may, succeed, in, 1825, when, tsar, alexander, died, suddenly, of, typhus, nicholas, was, caught, between, swearing, allegiance, to, constantine, and, accepting, the, throne, for, himself, the, interregnum, lasted, until, constantine, who, was, in, warsaw, at, that, time, officially, forfeited, his, right, to, succession, this, had, been, required, by, tsar, alexander, as, a, condition, of, constantine, s, marriage, to, his, second, wife, joanna, grudzinska, on, 25, 13, old, style, december, nicholas, issued, the, manifesto, proclaiming, his, accession, to, the, throne, that, manifesto, retroactively, named, 1, december, 19, november, old, style, the, date, of, alexander, i, s, death, as, the, beginning, of, his, reign, during, this, confusion, a, plot, was, hatched, by, some, members, of, the, military, to, overthrow, nicholas, and, seize, power, this, led, to, the, decembrist, revolt, on, 26, 14, old, style, december, 1825, an, uprising, nicholas, quickly, suppressed, nicholas, completely, lacked, his, brother, s, spiritual, and, intellectual, breadth, he, saw, his, role, simply, as, that, of, a, paternal, autocrat, ruling, his, people, by, whatever, means, necessary, nicholas, i, began, his, reign, on, 14, december, 1825, old, style, which, fell, on, a, monday, russian, superstition, held, that, mondays, were, unlucky, days, this, particular, monday, dawned, very, cold, with, temperatures, of, 8, degrees, celsius, this, was, regarded, by, the, russian, people, as, a, bad, omen, for, the, coming, reign, the, accession, of, nicholas, i, was, marred, by, a, demonstration, of, 3000, young, army, officers, and, other, liberal, minded, citizens, this, demonstration, was, an, attempt, to, force, the, government, to, accept, a, constitution, and, a, representative, form, of, government, nicholas, ordered, the, imperial, russian, army, to, smash, the, demonstration, the, uprising, was, quickly, put, down, and, became, known, as, the, decembrist, revolt, having, experienced, the, trauma, of, the, decembrist, revolt, on, the, first, day, of, his, reign, nicholas, i, was, determined, to, restrain, russian, society, the, third, section, of, the, imperial, chancellery, ran, a, huge, network, of, spies, and, informers, with, the, help, of, gendarmes, the, government, exercised, censorship, and, other, forms, of, control, over, education, publishing, and, all, manifestations, of, public, life, nicholas, appointed, alexander, benckendorff, to, head, this, chancellery, benckendorff, employed, 300, gendarmes, and, 16, staff, in, his, office, he, began, collecting, informers, and, intercepting, mail, soon, the, saying, that, it, was, impossible, to, sneeze, in, one, s, house, before, it, is, reported, to, the, emperor, became, benckendorff, s, creed, tsar, nicholas, abolished, several, areas, of, local, autonomy, bessarabia, s, autonomy, was, removed, in, 1828, poland, s, in, 1830, and, the, jewish, qahal, was, abolished, in, 1843, as, an, exception, to, this, trend, finland, was, able, to, keep, its, autonomy, partly, due, to, finnish, soldiers, loyal, participation, in, crushing, the, november, uprising, in, poland, russia, s, first, railway, was, opened, in, 1837, a, 26, km, 16, mi, line, between, st, petersburg, and, the, suburban, residence, of, tsarskoye, selo, the, second, was, the, saint, petersburg, moscow, railway, built, in, 1842, 51, nevertheless, by, 1855, there, were, only, 920, km, 570, mi, of, russian, railways, in, 1833, sergey, uvarov, of, the, ministry, of, national, education, devised, a, program, of, orthodoxy, autocracy, and, nationality, as, the, guiding, principle, of, the, regime, it, was, a, reactionary, policy, based, on, orthodoxy, in, religion, autocracy, in, government, and, the, state, founding, role, of, the, russian, nationality, and, equal, citizen, rights, for, all, other, peoples, inhabiting, russia, with, the, exclusion, of, jews, the, people, were, to, show, loyalty, to, the, unrestricted, authority, of, the, tsar, to, the, traditions, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, the, russian, language, these, romantic, and, conservative, principles, outlined, by, uvarov, were, also, espoused, by, vasily, zhukovsky, one, of, the, tutors, of, the, grand, duke, alexander, the, results, of, these, slavophile, principles, led, broadly, speaking, to, increasing, repression, of, all, classes, excessive, censorship, and, surveillance, of, independent, minded, intellectuals, like, pushkin, and, lermontov, and, to, the, persecution, of, non, russian, languages, and, non, orthodox, religions, taras, shevchenko, later, to, become, known, as, the, national, poet, of, ukraine, was, exiled, to, siberia, by, a, direct, order, of, tsar, nicholas, after, composing, a, poem, that, mocked, the, tsar, his, wife, and, his, domestic, policies, by, order, of, the, tsar, shevchenko, was, kept, under, strict, surveillance, and, prevented, from, writing, or, painting, from, 1839, tsar, nicholas, also, used, a, former, byzantine, catholic, priest, named, joseph, semashko, as, his, agent, to, force, orthodoxy, upon, the, eastern, rite, catholics, of, ukraine, belarus, and, lithuania, this, caused, tsar, nicholas, to, be, condemned, by, a, succession, of, roman, pontiffs, the, marquis, de, custine, charles, dickens, and, many, western, governments, see, also, cantonists, nicholas, disliked, serfdom, and, toyed, with, the, idea, of, abolishing, it, in, russia, but, declined, to, do, so, for, reasons, of, state, he, feared, the, aristocracy, and, believed, they, might, turn, against, him, if, he, abolished, serfdom, however, he, did, make, some, efforts, to, improve, the, lot, of, the, crown, serfs, serfs, owned, by, the, government, with, the, help, of, his, minister, pavel, kiselyov, during, most, of, his, reign, he, tried, to, increase, his, control, over, the, landowners, and, other, influential, groups, in, russia, in, 1831, nicholas, restricted, the, votes, in, the, noble, assembly, to, those, with, over, 100, serfs, leaving, 21, 916, voters, in, 1841, landless, nobles, were, banned, from, selling, serfs, separate, from, the, land, from, 1845, attainment, of, the, 5th, highest, rank, out, of, 14, in, the, table, of, ranks, was, required, to, be, ennobled, previously, it, had, been, the, 8th, rank, nicholas, was, crowned, king, of, poland, in, warsaw, on, 12, 24, may, 1829, per, the, polish, constitution, a, document, he, would, not, respect, thereafter, he, is, the, only, russian, monarch, ever, crowned, king, of, poland, although, not, the, only, one, bestowed, with, the, title, the, official, emphasis, on, russian, nationalism, fueled, a, debate, on, russia, s, place, in, the, world, the, meaning, of, russian, history, and, the, future, of, russia, one, group, the, westernizers, believed, that, russia, remained, backward, and, primitive, and, could, progress, only, through, adopting, european, culture, and, institutions, another, group, the, slavophiles, enthusiastically, favored, slavic, culture, and, customs, and, disdained, the, west, the, slavophiles, viewed, slavic, philosophy, as, a, source, of, wholeness, in, russia, and, were, sceptical, of, western, rationalism, and, materialism, some, of, them, believed, that, the, russian, peasant, commune, or, mir, offered, an, attractive, alternative, to, western, capitalism, and, could, save, europe, from, social, and, moral, revolution, thus, representing, a, form, of, russian, messianism, however, the, ministry, of, education, had, a, policy, of, closing, philosophy, faculties, to, curb, destabilizing, speculation, in, the, wake, of, the, decembrist, revolt, the, tsar, moved, to, protect, the, status, quo, by, centralizing, education, he, wanted, to, neutralize, the, threat, of, foreign, ideas, and, pseudo, knowledge, however, his, minister, of, education, sergei, uvarov, quietly, promoted, academic, freedom, and, autonomy, raised, academic, standards, improved, facilities, and, opened, higher, education, to, the, middle, classes, by, 1848, the, tsar, fearing, that, political, upheavals, in, the, west, might, spread, to, russia, ended, uvarov, s, innovations, the, universities, were, small, and, closely, monitored, especially, the, potentially, dangerous, philosophy, departments, their, main, mission, was, to, train, a, loyal, vigorous, manly, senior, bureaucracy, unspoiled, by, effeminate, office, work, the, imperial, academy, of, fine, arts, in, st, petersburg, became, the, main, source, of, recognition, and, support, for, artists, nicholas, i, decided, to, control, it, personally, reserving, the, final, say, on, artistic, honors, as, the, tsar, reprimanded, and, humiliated, artists, whose, works, he, found, distasteful, the, result, was, fear, insecurity, and, artistic, mediocrity, despite, the, repressions, of, this, period, russians, outside, official, control, produced, a, flowering, of, literature, and, the, performing, arts, through, the, works, of, aleksandr, pushkin, nikolai, gogol, ivan, turgenev, and, numerous, others, russian, literature, gained, international, stature, and, recognition, ballet, took, root, in, russia, after, its, importation, from, france, and, classical, music, became, firmly, established, with, the, compositions, of, mikhail, glinka, 1804, 1857, minister, of, finance, georg, von, cancrin, persuaded, the, emperor, of, the, benefits, of, inviting, prussian, scientist, alexander, von, humboldt, to, russia, to, investigate, regions, that, could, produce, mineral, wealth, the, russian, government, financed, humboldt, s, eight, month, expedition, through, russia, in, 1829, which, resulted, in, diamond, finds, in, the, ural, mountains, humboldt, published, multiple, volumes, on, his, russian, expedition, which, he, dedicated, to, nicholas, despite, his, increasing, disapproval, of, the, tsar, s, policies, in, 1851, the, jewish, population, numbered, at, 2, 4, million, including, 212, 000, in, russian, controlled, poland, this, made, them, one, of, the, largest, inorodtsy, non, slavic, minorities, in, the, russian, empire, on, 26, august, 1827, the, edict, of, military, conscription, ustav, rekrutskoi, povinnosti, was, introduced, which, required, jewish, boys, to, serve, in, the, russian, military, for, 25, years, from, the, age, of, 18, before, that, many, of, them, were, forcibly, conscripted, into, cantonist, schools, from, the, age, of, 12, while, being, a, cantonist, did, not, count, into, the, time, of, military, service, they, were, sent, far, away, from, their, families, to, serve, in, the, military, so, that, they, would, have, difficulty, practising, judaism, and, become, russified, and, sometimes, compelled, to, convert, to, christianity, the, poorer, village, jews, those, without, families, and, unmarried, jews, were, especially, targeted, for, military, service, between, 1827, and, 1854, it, is, estimated, that, there, were, 70, 000, jews, conscripted, under, nicholas, i, the, jewish, agricultural, colonisation, of, ukraine, continued, with, the, transfer, of, siberian, jews, to, ukraine, in, ukraine, jews, were, offered, the, opportunity, to, buy, land, which, left, very, little, to, support, their, families, on, the, other, hand, these, jews, were, exempt, from, forced, military, conscription, under, nicholas, i, there, were, attempts, to, reform, the, education, of, jews, with, the, object, of, russification, study, of, the, talmud, was, disfavored, nicholas, i, further, toughened, censorship, of, jewish, books, in, yiddish, and, hebrew, by, allowing, these, to, be, printed, only, in, zhitomir, and, vilna, nicolas, aggressive, foreign, policy, involved, many, expensive, wars, having, a, disastrous, effect, on, the, empire, s, finances, nicholas, lavished, attention, on, his, very, large, army, of, a, population, of, 60, 70, million, people, the, army, counted, one, million, men, they, had, outdated, equipment, and, tactics, but, the, tsar, who, dressed, like, a, soldier, and, surrounded, himself, with, officers, gloried, in, the, victory, over, napoleon, in, 1812, and, took, enormous, pride, in, its, smartness, on, parade, the, cavalry, horses, for, example, were, only, trained, in, parade, formations, and, did, poorly, in, battle, the, glitter, and, braid, masked, profound, weaknesses, that, he, did, not, see, he, put, generals, in, charge, of, most, of, his, civilian, agencies, regardless, of, their, qualifications, an, agnostic, who, won, fame, in, cavalry, charges, was, made, supervisor, of, church, affairs, the, army, became, the, vehicle, of, upward, social, mobility, for, noble, youths, from, non, russian, areas, such, as, poland, the, baltic, finland, and, georgia, on, the, other, hand, many, miscreants, petty, criminals, and, undesirables, were, punished, by, local, officials, by, being, enlisted, for, life, in, the, army, the, conscription, system, was, highly, unpopular, with, people, as, was, the, practice, of, forcing, peasants, to, house, the, soldiers, for, six, months, of, the, year, curtiss, finds, that, the, pedantry, of, nicholas, s, military, system, which, stressed, unthinking, obedience, and, parade, ground, evolutions, rather, than, combat, training, produced, ineffective, commanders, in, time, of, war, his, commanders, in, the, crimean, war, were, old, and, incompetent, and, indeed, so, were, his, muskets, as, the, colonels, sold, the, best, equipment, and, the, best, food, for, much, of, nicholas, reign, russia, was, seen, as, a, major, military, power, with, considerable, strength, the, crimean, war, fought, shortly, before, nicholas, death, demonstrated, to, both, russia, and, the, world, what, few, had, previously, realized, russia, was, militarily, weak, technologically, backward, and, administratively, incompetent, despite, his, grand, ambitions, toward, the, south, and, turkey, russia, had, not, built, railroad, network, in, that, direction, and, communications, were, bad, the, bureaucracy, was, unprepared, for, war, being, riddled, with, graft, corruption, and, inefficiency, the, navy, had, few, competent, officers, the, rank, and, file, were, poorly, trained, and, most, importantly, of, its, vessels, were, outdated, the, army, although, very, large, was, good, only, for, parades, suffered, from, colonels, who, pocketed, their, men, s, pay, poor, morale, and, was, even, more, out, of, touch, with, the, latest, technology, as, developed, by, britain, and, france, by, the, war, s, end, russia, s, leaders, were, determined, to, reform, their, military, and, society, as, fuller, notes, russia, had, been, beaten, on, the, crimean, peninsula, and, the, military, feared, that, it, would, inevitably, be, beaten, again, unless, steps, were, taken, to, surmount, its, military, weakness, an, intensely, militaristic, man, nicholas, regarded, the, army, as, the, best, and, greatest, institution, in, russia, and, as, a, model, for, society, saying, here, there, is, order, all, things, flow, logically, from, one, another, no, one, here, commands, without, first, learning, to, obey, no, one, rises, above, anyone, else, except, through, a, clearly, defined, system, everything, is, subordinated, to, a, single, defined, goal, and, everything, has, its, precise, designations, that, is, why, i, shall, always, hold, the, title, of, soldier, in, the, highest, esteem, i, regard, human, life, as, service, because, everybody, must, serve, nicholas, was, often, exasperated, by, the, slow, pace, of, the, russian, bureaucracy, and, had, a, marked, preference, for, appointing, generals, and, admirals, to, high, government, rank, because, of, their, perceived, efficiency, overlooking, or, ignoring, whether, or, not, they, were, actually, qualified, for, the, role, of, the, men, who, served, as, nicholas, s, ministers, 61, had, previously, served, as, a, general, or, an, admiral, nicholas, liked, to, appoint, generals, who, had, seen, combat, and, at, least, 30, of, the, men, who, served, as, a, minister, under, him, had, seen, action, in, the, wars, against, france, the, ottoman, empire, and, sweden, this, proved, to, be, something, of, a, handicap, in, the, sense, that, the, sort, of, qualities, that, could, make, a, man, distinguished, on, the, battlefields, such, as, bravery, did, not, necessarily, make, a, man, capable, of, running, a, ministry, the, most, notorious, case, was, prince, alexander, sergeyevich, menshikov, a, competent, brigade, commander, in, the, imperial, army, who, proved, himself, out, of, his, depth, as, a, navy, minister, of, the, emperor, s, ministers, 78, were, ethnic, russians, 9, 6, were, baltic, germans, while, the, rest, were, foreigners, in, russian, service, of, the, men, who, served, as, ministers, under, nicholas, 14, had, graduated, from, university, while, another, 14, had, graduated, from, a, lyc, e, or, a, gymnasium, the, rest, had, all, been, educated, by, private, tutors, in, foreign, policy, nicholas, i, acted, as, the, protector, of, ruling, legitimism, and, as, guardian, against, revolution, it, has, often, been, noted, that, such, policies, were, linked, with, the, metternich, counter, revolutionary, system, through, the, austrian, ambassador, count, karl, ludwig, von, ficquelmont, nicholas, s, offers, to, suppress, revolution, on, the, european, continent, trying, to, follow, the, pattern, set, by, his, eldest, brother, alexander, i, earned, him, the, label, of, gendarme, of, europe, immediately, on, his, succession, nicholas, began, to, limit, the, liberties, that, existed, under, the, constitutional, monarchy, in, congress, poland, nicholas, was, outraged, when, he, learned, of, the, belgian, revolt, against, the, dutch, in, 1830, and, ordered, the, imperial, russian, army, to, mobilize, nicholas, then, petitioned, the, prussian, ambassador, for, russian, troops, to, be, granted, transit, rights, in, order, to, march, across, europe, and, restore, dutch, hegemony, over, belgium, but, at, the, same, time, a, cholera, epidemic, was, decimating, russian, troops, and, the, revolt, in, poland, tied, down, russian, soldiers, which, might, have, been, deployed, against, the, belgians, it, seems, likely, that, nicholas, s, hawkish, stance, was, not, a, sincere, prelude, towards, invasion, of, the, low, countries, but, rather, an, attempt, to, apply, pressure, on, the, other, european, powers, nicholas, made, it, clear, he, would, only, act, if, prussia, and, britain, also, participated, as, he, feared, that, a, russian, invasion, of, belgium, would, cause, a, war, with, france, even, before, the, poles, rose, up, nicholas, had, cancelled, his, plans, for, invading, belgium, as, it, became, clear, that, neither, britain, nor, prussia, would, join, in, while, the, french, openly, threatened, war, if, nicholas, should, march, in, 1815, nicholas, arrived, in, france, where, he, stayed, with, the, duke, of, orleans, louis, philippe, who, soon, become, one, of, his, best, friends, with, the, grand, duke, being, impressed, with, duke, s, personal, warmth, intelligence, manners, and, grace, for, nicholas, the, worst, sort, of, characters, were, nobility, who, supported, liberalism, and, when, the, duc, d, orleans, become, the, king, of, the, french, as, louis, philippe, i, in, the, july, revolution, of, 1830, nicholas, took, this, as, a, personal, betrayal, believing, his, friend, had, gone, over, as, he, saw, it, to, the, dark, side, of, revolution, and, liberalism, nicholas, hated, louis, philippe, the, self, styled, le, roi, citoyen, the, citizen, king, as, a, renegade, nobleman, and, an, usurper, and, his, foreign, policy, starting, in, 1830, was, primarily, anti, french, based, upon, reviving, the, coalition, that, had, existed, during, the, napoleonic, era, of, russia, prussia, austria, and, britain, to, isolate, france, nicholas, detested, louis, philippe, to, the, point, that, he, refused, to, use, his, name, referring, to, him, merely, as, the, usurper, britain, was, unwilling, to, join, the, anti, french, coalition, but, nicholas, was, successful, in, cementing, existing, close, ties, with, austria, and, prussia, and, the, three, imperial, states, regularly, held, joint, military, reviews, during, this, time, for, much, of, the, 1830s, a, sort, of, cold, war, existed, between, the, liberal, western, bloc, of, france, and, britain, vs, the, reactionary, eastern, bloc, of, austria, prussia, and, russia, after, the, november, uprising, broke, out, in, 1831, the, polish, parliament, deposed, nicholas, as, king, of, poland, in, response, to, his, repeated, curtailment, of, its, constitutional, rights, nicholas, reacted, by, sending, russian, troops, into, poland, and, brutally, crushed, the, rebellion, nicholas, then, proceeded, to, abrogate, the, polish, constitution, in, virtual, entirety, and, reduced, poland, to, the, status, of, a, province, called, vistula, land, soon, after, nicholas, embarked, on, a, policy, of, repressing, polish, culture, beginning, with, suppressing, the, polish, catholic, church, in, the, 1840s, nicholas, reduced, 64, 000, polish, nobles, to, commoner, status, in, 1848, when, a, series, of, revolutions, convulsed, europe, nicholas, was, at, the, forefront, of, reactionism, in, 1849, he, helped, the, habsburgs, to, suppress, the, revolution, in, hungary, and, he, also, urged, prussia, not, to, adopt, a, liberal, constitution, while, nicholas, was, attempting, to, maintain, the, status, quo, in, europe, he, followed, a, somewhat, more, aggressive, policy, toward, the, neighbouring, empires, to, the, south, the, ottoman, empire, and, persia, nicholas, was, widely, believed, at, the, time, to, be, following, the, traditional, russian, policy, of, resolving, the, so, called, eastern, question, by, seeking, to, partition, the, ottoman, empire, and, establish, a, protectorate, over, the, orthodox, population, of, the, balkans, still, largely, under, ottoman, control, in, the, 1820s, in, fact, nicholas, was, deeply, committed, to, upholding, the, status, quo, in, europe, and, feared, any, attempt, to, devour, the, decaying, ottoman, empire, would, both, upset, his, ally, austria, which, also, had, interests, in, the, balkans, and, bring, about, an, anglo, french, coalition, in, defense, of, the, ottomans, furthermore, in, the, war, of, 1828, 29, the, russians, defeated, the, ottomans, in, every, battle, fought, in, the, field, and, advanced, deep, into, the, balkans, but, the, russians, discovered, that, they, lacked, the, necessary, logistical, strength, to, take, constantinople, nicholas, policy, towards, the, ottoman, empire, was, to, use, the, 1774, treaty, of, k, k, kaynarca, which, gave, russia, a, vague, right, as, protector, of, orthodox, peoples, in, the, balkans, as, a, way, of, placing, the, ottoman, empire, into, the, russian, sphere, of, influence, which, was, felt, to, be, a, more, achievable, goal, than, conquering, the, entire, ottoman, empire, nicholas, actually, wanted, to, preserve, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, stable, but, weak, state, that, would, be, unable, to, stand, up, to, russia, which, was, felt, to, serve, russia, s, interests, nicholas, always, thought, of, russia, as, first, and, foremost, a, european, power, and, regarded, europe, as, more, important, than, the, middle, east, the, russian, foreign, minister, karl, nesselrode, wrote, in, letter, to, his, ambassador, in, constantinople, nikolai, muravyov, that, the, victory, of, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, over, mahmud, ii, would, lead, to, a, new, dynasty, ruling, the, ottoman, empire, nesselrode, continued, that, if, the, able, muhammad, ali, became, sultan, then, it, could, with, the, elevation, of, a, new, personage, to, the, turkish, throne, revive, new, strength, in, that, declining, empire, and, distract, our, attention, and, forces, from, european, affairs, and, thus, the, monarch, is, especially, concerned, to, keep, the, sultan, on, his, tottering, throne, at, the, same, time, nicholas, argued, that, because, of, the, economic, importance, to, russia, of, the, turkish, straits, through, which, russia, exports, its, grain, that, russia, had, the, right, to, intervene, in, ottoman, affairs, in, 1833, nicholas, told, the, austrian, ambassador, karl, ludwig, von, ficquelmont, that, oriental, affairs, are, above, all, a, matter, for, russia, at, the, same, time, that, nicholas, claimed, the, ottoman, empire, was, within, the, russian, sphere, of, influence, he, made, it, clear, that, he, had, no, interest, in, annexing, the, empire, at, another, meeting, with, ficquelmont, in, 1833, nicholas, speaking, with, the, greek, project, of, catherine, the, great, in, mind, said, i, know, everything, that, has, been, said, of, the, projects, of, the, empress, catherine, and, russia, has, renounced, the, goal, she, had, set, out, i, wish, to, maintain, the, turkish, empire, it, if, falls, i, do, not, desire, its, debris, i, need, nothing, ultimately, nicholas, s, policies, in, the, near, east, proved, to, be, both, costly, and, largely, futile, in, 1826, 28, nicholas, fought, the, russo, persian, war, 1826, 28, which, ended, with, persia, forced, to, cede, its, last, remaining, territories, in, the, caucasus, russia, had, conquered, all, the, territories, of, iran, in, both, the, north, caucasus, and, south, caucasus, comprising, modern, day, georgia, dagestan, armenia, and, azerbaijan, through, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, the, treaty, further, conceded, extraterritoriality, to, russian, subjects, in, iran, capitulation, as, professor, virginia, aksan, adds, the, 1828, treaty, of, turkmenchay, removed, iran, from, the, military, equation, russia, fought, a, successful, war, against, the, ottomans, in, 1828, 29, but, it, did, little, to, increase, russian, power, in, europe, only, a, small, greek, state, became, independent, in, the, balkans, with, limited, russian, influence, in, 1833, russia, negotiated, the, treaty, of, unkiar, skelessi, with, the, ottoman, empire, the, major, european, parties, mistakenly, believed, that, the, treaty, contained, a, secret, clause, granting, russia, the, right, to, transit, warships, through, the, bosphorus, and, dardanelles, straits, this, misconception, led, to, the, london, straits, convention, of, 1841, which, affirmed, ottoman, control, over, the, straits, and, forbade, any, power, including, russia, from, sending, warships, through, them, buoyed, by, his, role, in, suppressing, the, revolutions, of, 1848, as, well, as, his, mistaken, belief, he, could, rely, on, british, diplomatic, support, nicholas, moved, against, the, ottomans, who, declared, war, on, russia, on, 8, october, 1853, on, 30, november, russian, admiral, nakhimov, caught, the, turkish, fleet, in, the, harbor, at, sinope, and, destroyed, it, fearing, the, results, of, a, total, ottoman, defeat, by, russia, in, 1854, britain, france, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, formed, a, military, coalition, and, joined, forces, with, the, ottoman, empire, against, russia, the, preceding, conflict, became, known, as, the, crimean, war, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, western, europe, but, was, labelled, in, russia, the, eastern, war, russian, vostochnaya, vojna, in, april, 1854, austria, signed, a, defensive, pact, with, prussia, thus, russia, found, herself, in, a, war, with, every, great, power, of, europe, either, allied, against, her, militarily, or, diplomatically, in, 1853, mikhail, pogodin, professor, of, history, at, moscow, university, wrote, a, memorandum, to, nicholas, nicholas, himself, read, pogodin, s, text, and, approvingly, commented, that, is, the, whole, point, according, to, historian, orlando, figes, the, memorandum, clearly, struck, a, chord, with, nicholas, who, shared, pogodin, s, sense, that, russia, s, role, as, the, protector, of, the, orthodox, had, not, been, recognized, or, understood, and, that, russia, was, unfairly, treated, by, the, west, pogodin, wrote, france, takes, algeria, from, turkey, and, almost, every, year, england, annexes, another, indian, principality, none, of, this, disturbs, the, balance, of, power, but, when, russia, occupies, moldavia, and, wallachia, albeit, only, temporarily, that, disturbs, the, balance, of, power, france, occupies, rome, and, stays, there, several, years, during, peacetime, that, is, nothing, but, russia, only, thinks, of, occupying, constantinople, and, the, peace, of, europe, is, threatened, the, english, declare, war, on, the, chinese, who, have, it, seems, offended, them, no, one, has, the, right, to, intervene, but, russia, is, obliged, to, ask, europe, for, permission, if, it, quarrels, with, its, neighbor, england, threatens, greece, to, support, the, false, claims, of, a, miserable, jew, and, burns, its, fleet, that, is, a, lawful, action, but, russia, demands, a, treaty, to, protect, millions, of, christians, and, that, is, deemed, to, strengthen, its, position, in, the, east, at, the, expense, of, the, balance, of, power, we, can, expect, nothing, from, the, west, but, blind, hatred, and, malice, austria, offered, the, ottomans, diplomatic, support, and, prussia, remained, neutral, thus, leaving, russia, without, any, allies, on, the, continent, the, european, allies, landed, in, crimea, and, laid, siege, to, the, well, fortified, russian, sevastopol, naval, base, the, russians, lost, battles, at,

occasional, efforts, to, revive, his, reputation, at, the, end, of, his, life, one, of, his, most, devoted, civil, servants, aleksandr, nikitenko, opined, the, main, failing, of, the, reign, of, nicholas, pavlovich, was, that, it, was, all, a, mistake, in, 1891, lev, tolstoy, popularised, the, nickname, nicholas, the, stick, in, reference, to, the, late, emperor, s, passion, for, military, discipline, historian, barbara, jelavich, points, to, many, failures, including, the, catastrophic, state, of, russian, finances, the, badly, equipped, army, the, inadequate, transportation, system, and, a, bureaucracy, characterized, by, graft, corruption, and, inefficiency, kiev, university, was, founded, in, 1834, by, nicholas, in, 1854, there, were, 3600, university, students, in, russia,

but, his, sincere, sense, of, duty, forced, him, to, impose, severe, discipline, if, the, emperor, has, no, more, of, mercy, in, his, heart, than, he, reveals, in, his, policies, then, i, pity, russia, if, on, the, other, hand, his, true, sentiments, are, really, superior, to, his, acts, then, i, pity, the, emperor, according, to, a, popular, legend, when, the, saint, petersburg, moscow, railway, was, planned, in, 1842, nicholas, drew, a, straight, line, between, the, cities, on, a, map, and, decreed, this, as, the, path, of, the, new, rail, line, some, ridiculed, this, as, the, epitome, of, nicholas, mindless, despotism, while, others, praised, the, tsar, for, overcoming, local, interests, that, wanted, the, railway, diverted, their, own, way, in, fact, however, the, tsar, had, merely, endorsed, the, straight, path, recommended, by, engineers, nicholas, i, had, seven, legitimate, children, with, his, wife, alexandra, feodorovna, many, sources, state, that, nicholas, did, not, have, an, extramarital, affair, until, after, 25, years, of, marriage, in, 1842, when, the, empress, s, doctors, prohibited, her, from, having, sexual, intercourse, due, to, her, poor,
