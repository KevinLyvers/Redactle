attila, t, l, til, or, t, l, at, il, fl, c, 406, 453, frequently, called, attila, the, hun, was, the, ruler, of, the, huns, from, 434, until, his, death, in, early, 453, he, was, also, the, leader, of, an, empire, consisting, of, huns, ostrogoths, alans, and, gepids, among, others, in, central, and, eastern, europe, as, nephews, to, rugila, attila, and, his, elder, brother, bleda, succeeded, him, to, the, throne, in, 435, ruling, jointly, until, the, death, of, bleda, in, 445, during, his, reign, attila, was, one, of, the, most, feared, enemies, of, the, western, and, eastern, roman, empires, he, crossed, the, danube, twice, and, plundered, the, balkans, but, was, unable, to, take, constantinople, in, 441, he, led, an, invasion, of, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, the, success, of, which, emboldened, him, to, invade, the, west, he, also, attempted, to, conquer, roman, gaul, modern, france, crossing, the, rhine, in, 451, and, marching, as, far, as, aurelianum, orl, ans, before, being, stopped, in, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, he, subsequently, invaded, italy, devastating, the, northern, provinces, but, was, unable, to, take, rome, he, planned, for, further, campaigns, against, the, romans, but, died, in, 453, after, attila, s, death, his, close, adviser, ardaric, of, the, gepids, led, a, germanic, revolt, against, hunnic, rule, after, which, the, hunnic, empire, quickly, collapsed, attila, lived, on, as, a, character, in, germanic, heroic, legend, many, scholars, have, argued, that, the, name, attila, derives, from, east, germanic, origin, attila, is, formed, from, the, gothic, or, gepidic, noun, atta, father, by, means, of, the, diminutive, suffix, ila, meaning, little, father, compare, wulfila, from, wulfs, wolf, and, ila, i, e, little, wolf, 386, 29, 46, the, gothic, etymology, was, first, proposed, by, jacob, and, wilhelm, grimm, in, the, early, 19th, century, 211, maenchen, helfen, notes, that, this, derivation, of, the, name, offers, neither, phonetic, nor, semantic, difficulties, 386, and, gerhard, doerfer, notes, that, the, name, is, simply, correct, gothic, 29, alexander, savelyev, and, choongwon, jeong, 2020, similarly, state, that, attila, s, name, must, have, been, gothic, in, origin, the, name, has, sometimes, been, interpreted, as, a, germanization, of, a, name, of, hunnic, origin, 29, 32, other, scholars, have, argued, for, a, turkic, origin, of, the, name, omeljan, pritsak, considered, att, la, a, composite, title, name, which, derived, from, turkic, es, great, old, and, til, sea, ocean, and, the, suffix, a, 444, the, stressed, back, syllabic, til, assimilated, the, front, member, es, so, it, became, as, 444, it, is, a, nominative, in, form, of, att, l, ets, l, es, t, l, with, the, meaning, the, oceanic, universal, ruler, 444, j, j, mikkola, connected, it, with, turkic, t, name, fame, 216, as, another, turkic, possibility, h, althof, 1902, considered, it, was, related, to, turkish, atli, horseman, cavalier, or, turkish, at, horse, and, dil, tongue, 216, maenchen, helfen, argues, that, pritsak, s, derivation, is, ingenious, but, for, many, reasons, unacceptable, 387, while, dismissing, mikkola, s, as, too, farfetched, to, be, taken, seriously, 390, m, sn, dal, similarly, notes, that, none, of, these, proposals, has, achieved, wide, acceptance, 215, 216, criticizing, the, proposals, of, finding, turkic, or, other, etymologies, for, attila, doerfer, notes, that, king, george, vi, of, the, united, kingdom, had, a, name, of, greek, origin, and, s, leyman, the, magnificent, had, a, name, of, arabic, origin, yet, that, does, not, make, them, greeks, or, arabs, it, is, therefore, plausible, that, attila, would, have, a, name, not, of, hunnic, origin, 31, 32, historian, hyun, jin, kim, however, has, argued, that, the, turkic, etymology, is, more, probable, 30, m, sn, dal, in, a, paper, that, rejects, the, germanic, derivation, but, notes, the, problems, with, the, existing, proposed, turkic, etymologies, argues, that, attila, s, name, could, have, originated, from, turkic, mongolian, at, adyy, agta, gelding, warhorse, and, turkish, atl, horseman, cavalier, meaning, possessor, of, geldings, provider, of, warhorses, 216, 217, the, historiography, of, attila, is, faced, with, a, major, challenge, in, that, the, only, complete, sources, are, written, in, greek, and, latin, by, the, enemies, of, the, huns, attila, s, contemporaries, left, many, testimonials, of, his, life, but, only, fragments, of, these, remain, 25, priscus, was, a, byzantine, diplomat, and, historian, who, wrote, in, greek, and, he, was, both, a, witness, to, and, an, actor, in, the, story, of, attila, as, a, member, of, the, embassy, of, theodosius, ii, at, the, hunnic, court, in, 449, he, was, obviously, biased, by, his, political, position, but, his, writing, is, a, major, source, for, information, on, the, life, of, attila, and, he, is, the, only, person, known, to, have, recorded, a, physical, description, of, him, he, wrote, a, history, of, the, late, roman, empire, in, eight, books, covering, the, period, from, 430, to, 476, only, fragments, of, priscus, work, remain, it, was, cited, extensively, by, 6th, century, historians, procopius, and, jordanes, 413, especially, in, jordanes, the, origin, and, deeds, of, the, goths, which, contains, numerous, references, to, priscus, s, history, and, it, is, also, an, important, source, of, information, about, the, hunnic, empire, and, its, neighbors, he, describes, the, legacy, of, attila, and, the, hunnic, people, for, a, century, after, attila, s, death, marcellinus, comes, a, chancellor, of, justinian, during, the, same, era, also, describes, the, relations, between, the, huns, and, the, eastern, roman, empire, 30, numerous, ecclesiastical, writings, contain, useful, but, scattered, information, sometimes, difficult, to, authenticate, or, distorted, by, years, of, hand, copying, between, the, 6th, and, 17th, centuries, the, hungarian, writers, of, the, 12th, century, wished, to, portray, the, huns, in, a, positive, light, as, their, glorious, ancestors, and, so, repressed, certain, historical, elements, and, added, their, own, legends, 32, the, literature, and, knowledge, of, the, huns, themselves, was, transmitted, orally, by, means, of, epics, and, chanted, poems, that, were, handed, down, from, generation, to, generation, 354, indirectly, fragments, of, this, oral, history, have, reached, us, via, the, literature, of, the, scandinavians, and, germans, neighbors, of, the, huns, who, wrote, between, the, 9th, and, 13th, centuries, attila, is, a, major, character, in, many, medieval, epics, such, as, the, nibelungenlied, as, well, as, various, eddas, and, sagas, 32, 354, archaeological, investigation, has, uncovered, some, details, about, the, lifestyle, art, and, warfare, of, the, huns, there, are, a, few, traces, of, battles, and, sieges, but, the, tomb, of, attila, and, the, location, of, his, capital, have, not, yet, been, found, 33, 37, the, huns, were, a, group, of, eurasian, nomads, appearing, from, east, of, the, volga, who, migrated, further, into, western, europe, c, 370, and, built, up, an, enormous, empire, there, their, main, military, techniques, were, mounted, archery, and, javelin, throwing, they, were, in, the, process, of, developing, settlements, before, their, arrival, in, western, europe, yet, the, huns, were, a, society, of, pastoral, warriors, 259, whose, primary, form, of, nourishment, was, meat, and, milk, products, of, their, herds, the, origin, and, language, of, the, huns, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, for, centuries, according, to, some, theories, their, leaders, at, least, may, have, spoken, a, turkic, language, perhaps, closest, to, the, modern, chuvash, language, 444, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, european, peoples, the, huns, especially, those, who, migrated, to, the, west, may, have, been, a, combination, of, central, asian, turkic, mongolic, and, ugric, stocks, attila, s, father, mundzuk, was, the, brother, of, kings, octar, and, ruga, who, reigned, jointly, over, the, hunnic, empire, in, the, early, fifth, century, this, form, of, diarchy, was, recurrent, with, the, huns, but, historians, are, unsure, whether, it, was, institutionalized, merely, customary, or, an, occasional, occurrence, 80, his, family, was, from, a, noble, lineage, but, it, is, uncertain, whether, they, constituted, a, royal, dynasty, attila, s, birthdate, is, debated, journalist, ric, deschodt, and, writer, herman, schreiber, have, proposed, a, date, of, 395, however, historian, iaroslav, lebedynsky, and, archaeologist, katalin, escher, prefer, an, estimate, between, the, 390s, and, the, first, decade, of, the, fifth, century, 40, several, historians, have, proposed, 406, as, the, date, 92, 202, attila, grew, up, in, a, rapidly, changing, world, his, people, were, nomads, who, had, only, recently, arrived, in, europe, they, crossed, the, volga, river, during, the, 370s, and, annexed, the, territory, of, the, alans, then, attacked, the, gothic, kingdom, between, the, carpathian, mountains, and, the, danube, they, were, a, very, mobile, people, whose, mounted, archers, had, acquired, a, reputation, for, invincibility, and, the, germanic, tribes, seemed, unable, to, withstand, them, 133, 151, vast, populations, fleeing, the, huns, moved, from, germania, into, the, roman, empire, in, the, west, and, south, and, along, the, banks, of, the, rhine, and, danube, in, 376, the, goths, crossed, the, danube, initially, submitting, to, the, romans, but, soon, rebelling, against, emperor, valens, whom, they, killed, in, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, 100, large, numbers, of, vandals, alans, suebi, and, burgundians, crossed, the, rhine, and, invaded, roman, gaul, on, december, 31, 406, to, escape, the, huns, 233, the, roman, empire, had, been, split, in, half, since, 395, and, was, ruled, by, two, distinct, governments, one, based, in, ravenna, in, the, west, and, the, other, in, constantinople, in, the, east, the, roman, emperors, both, east, and, west, were, generally, from, the, theodosian, family, in, attila, s, lifetime, despite, several, power, struggles, 13, the, huns, dominated, a, vast, territory, with, nebulous, borders, determined, by, the, will, of, a, constellation, of, ethnically, varied, peoples, some, were, assimilated, to, hunnic, nationality, whereas, many, retained, their, own, identities, and, rulers, but, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, the, king, of, the, huns, 11, the, huns, were, also, the, indirect, source, of, many, of, the, romans, problems, driving, various, germanic, tribes, into, roman, territory, yet, relations, between, the, two, empires, were, cordial, the, romans, used, the, huns, as, mercenaries, against, the, germans, and, even, in, their, civil, wars, thus, the, usurper, joannes, was, able, to, recruit, thousands, of, huns, for, his, army, against, valentinian, iii, in, 424, it, was, a, tius, later, patrician, of, the, west, who, managed, this, operation, they, exchanged, ambassadors, and, hostages, the, alliance, lasting, from, 401, to, 450, and, permitting, the, romans, numerous, military, victories, 111, the, huns, considered, the, romans, to, be, paying, them, tribute, whereas, the, romans, preferred, to, view, this, as, payment, for, services, rendered, the, huns, had, become, a, great, power, by, the, time, that, attila, came, of, age, during, the, reign, of, his, uncle, ruga, to, the, point, that, nestorius, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, deplored, the, situation, with, these, words, they, have, become, both, masters, and, slaves, of, the, romans, 128, the, death, of, rugila, also, known, as, rua, or, ruga, in, 434, left, the, sons, of, his, brother, mundzuk, attila, and, bleda, in, control, of, the, united, hun, tribes, at, the, time, of, the, two, brothers, accession, the, hun, tribes, were, bargaining, with, eastern, roman, emperor, theodosius, ii, s, envoys, for, the, return, of, several, renegades, who, had, taken, refuge, within, the, eastern, roman, empire, possibly, hunnic, nobles, who, disagreed, with, the, brothers, assumption, of, leadership, the, following, year, attila, and, bleda, met, with, the, imperial, legation, at, margus, po, arevac, all, seated, on, horseback, in, the, hunnic, manner, and, negotiated, an, advantageous, treaty, the, romans, agreed, to, return, the, fugitives, to, double, their, previous, tribute, of, 350, roman, pounds, c, 115, kg, of, gold, to, open, their, markets, to, hunnish, traders, and, to, pay, a, ransom, of, eight, solidi, for, each, roman, taken, prisoner, by, the, huns, the, huns, satisfied, with, the, treaty, decamped, from, the, roman, empire, and, returned, to, their, home, in, the, great, hungarian, plain, perhaps, to, consolidate, and, strengthen, their, empire, theodosius, used, this, opportunity, to, strengthen, the, walls, of, constantinople, building, the, city, s, first, sea, wall, and, to, build, up, his, border, defenses, along, the, danube, the, huns, remained, out, of, roman, sight, for, the, next, few, years, while, they, invaded, the, sassanid, empire, they, were, defeated, in, armenia, by, the, sassanids, abandoned, their, invasion, and, turned, their, attentions, back, to, europe, in, 440, they, reappeared, in, force, on, the, borders, of, the, roman, empire, attacking, the, merchants, at, the, market, on, the, north, bank, of, the, danube, that, had, been, established, by, the, treaty, of, 435, crossing, the, danube, they, laid, waste, to, the, cities, of, illyricum, and, forts, on, the, river, including, according, to, priscus, viminacium, a, city, of, moesia, their, advance, began, at, margus, where, they, demanded, that, the, romans, turn, over, a, bishop, who, had, retained, property, that, attila, regarded, as, his, while, the, romans, discussed, the, bishop, s, fate, he, slipped, away, secretly, to, the, huns, and, betrayed, the, city, to, them, while, the, huns, attacked, city, states, along, the, danube, the, vandals, led, by, geiseric, captured, the, western, roman, province, of, africa, and, its, capital, of, carthage, africa, was, the, richest, province, of, the, western, empire, and, a, main, source, of, food, for, rome, the, sassanid, shah, yazdegerd, ii, invaded, armenia, in, 441, the, romans, stripped, the, balkan, area, of, forces, sending, them, to, sicily, in, order, to, mount, an, expedition, against, the, vandals, in, africa, this, left, attila, and, bleda, a, clear, path, through, illyricum, into, the, balkans, which, they, invaded, in, 441, the, hunnish, army, sacked, margus, and, viminacium, and, then, took, singidunum, belgrade, and, sirmium, during, 442, theodosius, recalled, his, troops, from, sicily, and, ordered, a, large, issue, of, new, coins, to, finance, operations, against, the, huns, he, believed, that, he, could, defeat, the, huns, and, refused, the, hunnish, kings, demands, attila, responded, with, a, campaign, in, 443, for, the, first, time, as, far, as, the, romans, knew, his, forces, were, equipped, with, battering, rams, and, rolling, siege, towers, with, which, they, successfully, assaulted, the, military, centers, of, ratiara, and, naissus, ni, and, massacred, the, inhabitants, priscus, said, when, we, arrived, at, naissus, we, found, the, city, deserted, as, though, it, had, been, sacked, only, a, few, sick, persons, lay, in, the, churches, we, halted, at, a, short, distance, from, the, river, in, an, open, space, for, all, the, ground, adjacent, to, the, bank, was, full, of, the, bones, of, men, slain, in, war, advancing, along, the, ni, ava, river, the, huns, next, took, serdica, sofia, philippopolis, plovdiv, and, arcadiopolis, l, leburgaz, they, encountered, and, destroyed, a, roman, army, outside, constantinople, but, were, stopped, by, the, double, walls, of, the, eastern, capital, they, defeated, a, second, army, near, callipolis, gelibolu, theodosius, unable, to, make, effective, armed, resistance, admitted, defeat, sending, the, magister, militum, per, orientem, anatolius, to, negotiate, peace, terms, the, terms, were, harsher, than, the, previous, treaty, the, emperor, agreed, to, hand, over, 6, 000, roman, pounds, c, 2000, kg, of, gold, as, punishment, for, having, disobeyed, the, terms, of, the, treaty, during, the, invasion, the, yearly, tribute, was, tripled, rising, to, 2, 100, roman, pounds, c, 700, kg, in, gold, and, the, ransom, for, each, roman, prisoner, rose, to, 12, solidi, their, demands, were, met, for, a, time, and, the, hun, kings, withdrew, into, the, interior, of, their, empire, bleda, died, following, the, huns, withdrawal, from, byzantium, probably, around, 445, attila, then, took, the, throne, for, himself, becoming, the, sole, ruler, of, the, huns, in, 447, attila, again, rode, south, into, the, eastern, roman, empire, through, moesia, the, roman, army, under, gothic, magister, militum, arnegisclus, met, him, in, the, battle, of, the, utus, and, was, defeated, though, not, without, inflicting, heavy, losses, the, huns, were, left, unopposed, and, rampaged, through, the, balkans, as, far, as, thermopylae, constantinople, itself, was, saved, by, the, isaurian, troops, of, magister, militum, per, orientem, zeno, and, protected, by, the, intervention, of, prefect, constantinus, who, organized, the, reconstruction, of, the, walls, that, had, been, previously, damaged, by, earthquakes, and, in, some, places, to, construct, a, new, line, of, fortification, in, front, of, the, old, callinicus, in, his, life, of, saint, hypatius, wrote, the, barbarian, nation, of, the, huns, which, was, in, thrace, became, so, great, that, more, than, a, hundred, cities, were, captured, and, constantinople, almost, came, into, danger, and, most, men, fled, from, it, and, there, were, so, many, murders, and, blood, lettings, that, the, dead, could, not, be, numbered, ay, for, they, took, captive, the, churches, and, monasteries, and, slew, the, monks, and, maidens, in, great, numbers, in, 450, attila, proclaimed, his, intent, to, attack, the, visigoth, kingdom, of, toulouse, by, making, an, alliance, with, emperor, valentinian, iii, he, had, previously, been, on, good, terms, with, the, western, roman, empire, and, its, influential, general, flavius, a, tius, a, tius, had, spent, a, brief, exile, among, the, huns, in, 433, and, the, troops, that, attila, provided, against, the, goths, and, bagaudae, had, helped, earn, him, the, largely, honorary, title, of, magister, militum, in, the, west, the, gifts, and, diplomatic, efforts, of, geiseric, who, opposed, and, feared, the, visigoths, may, also, have, influenced, attila, s, plans, however, valentinian, s, sister, was, honoria, who, had, sent, the, hunnish, king, a, plea, for, help, and, her, engagement, ring, in, order, to, escape, her, forced, betrothal, to, a, roman, senator, in, the, spring, of, 450, honoria, may, not, have, intended, a, proposal, of, marriage, but, attila, chose, to, interpret, her, message, as, such, he, accepted, asking, for, half, of, the, western, empire, as, dowry, when, valentinian, discovered, the, plan, only, the, influence, of, his, mother, galla, placidia, convinced, him, to, exile, honoria, rather, than, killing, her, he, also, wrote, to, attila, strenuously, denying, the, legitimacy, of, the, supposed, marriage, proposal, attila, sent, an, emissary, to, ravenna, to, proclaim, that, honoria, was, innocent, that, the, proposal, had, been, legitimate, and, that, he, would, come, to, claim, what, was, rightfully, his, attila, interfered, in, a, succession, struggle, after, the, death, of, a, frankish, ruler, attila, supported, the, elder, son, while, a, tius, supported, the, younger, the, location, and, identity, of, these, kings, is, not, known, and, subject, to, conjecture, attila, gathered, his, vassals, gepids, ostrogoths, rugians, scirians, heruls, thuringians, alans, burgundians, among, others, and, began, his, march, west, in, 451, he, arrived, in, belgica, with, an, army, exaggerated, by, jordanes, to, half, a, million, strong, on, april, 7, he, captured, metz, he, also, captured, strasbourg, other, cities, attacked, can, be, determined, by, the, hagiographic, vitae, written, to, commemorate, their, bishops, nicasius, was, slaughtered, before, the, altar, of, his, church, in, rheims, servatus, is, alleged, to, have, saved, tongeren, with, his, prayers, as, saint, genevieve, is, said, to, have, saved, paris, lupus, bishop, of, troyes, is, also, credited, with, saving, his, city, by, meeting, attila, in, person, a, tius, moved, to, oppose, attila, gathering, troops, from, among, the, franks, the, burgundians, and, the, celts, a, mission, by, avitus, and, attila, s, continued, westward, advance, convinced, the, visigoth, king, theodoric, i, theodorid, to, ally, with, the, romans, the, combined, armies, reached, orl, ans, ahead, of, attila, thus, checking, and, turning, back, the, hunnish, advance, a, tius, gave, chase, and, caught, the, huns, at, a, place, usually, assumed, to, be, near, catalaunum, modern, ch, lons, en, champagne, attila, decided, to, fight, the, romans, on, plains, where, he, could, use, his, cavalry, the, two, armies, clashed, in, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, the, outcome, of, which, is, commonly, considered, to, be, a, strategic, victory, for, the, visigothic, roman, alliance, theodoric, was, killed, in, the, fighting, and, a, tius, failed, to, press, his, advantage, according, to, edward, gibbon, and, edward, creasy, because, he, feared, the, consequences, of, an, overwhelming, visigothic, triumph, as, much, as, he, did, a, defeat, from, a, tius, point, of, view, the, best, outcome, was, what, occurred, theodoric, died, attila, was, in, retreat, and, disarray, and, the, romans, had, the, benefit, of, appearing, victorious, attila, returned, in, 452, to, renew, his, marriage, claim, with, honoria, invading, and, ravaging, italy, along, the, way, communities, became, established, in, what, would, later, become, venice, as, a, result, of, these, attacks, when, the, residents, fled, to, small, islands, in, the, venetian, lagoon, his, army, sacked, numerous, cities, and, razed, aquileia, so, completely, that, it, was, afterwards, hard, to, recognize, its, original, site, 159, a, tius, lacked, the, strength, to, offer, battle, but, managed, to, harass, and, slow, attila, s, advance, with, only, a, shadow, force, attila, finally, halted, at, the, river, po, by, this, point, disease, and, starvation, may, have, taken, hold, in, attila, s, camp, thus, hindering, his, war, efforts, and, potentially, contributing, to, the, cessation, of, invasion, emperor, valentinian, iii, sent, three, envoys, the, high, civilian, officers, gennadius, avienus, and, trigetius, as, well, as, pope, leo, i, who, met, attila, at, mincio, in, the, vicinity, of, mantua, and, obtained, from, him, the, promise, that, he, would, withdraw, from, italy, and, negotiate, peace, with, the, emperor, prosper, of, aquitaine, gives, a, short, description, of, the, historic, meeting, but, gives, all, the, credit, to, leo, for, the, successful, negotiation, priscus, reports, that, superstitious, fear, of, the, fate, of, alaric, gave, him, pause, as, alaric, died, shortly, after, sacking, rome, in, 410, italy, had, suffered, from, a, terrible, famine, in, 451, and, her, crops, were, faring, little, better, in, 452, attila, s, devastating, invasion, of, the, plains, of, northern, italy, this, year, did, not, improve, the, harvest, 161, to, advance, on, rome, would, have, required, supplies, which, were, not, available, in, italy, and, taking, the, city, would, not, have, improved, attila, s, supply, situation, therefore, it, was, more, profitable, for, attila, to, conclude, peace, and, retreat, to, his, homeland, 160, 161, furthermore, an, east, roman, force, had, crossed, the, danube, under, the, command, of, another, officer, also, named, aetius, who, had, participated, in, the, council, of, chalcedon, the, previous, year, and, proceeded, to, defeat, the, huns, who, had, been, left, behind, by, attila, to, safeguard, their, home, territories, attila, hence, faced, heavy, human, and, natural, pressures, to, retire, from, italy, without, ever, setting, foot, south, of, the, po, 163, as, hydatius, writes, in, his, chronica, minora, the, huns, who, had, been, plundering, italy, and, who, had, also, stormed, a, number, of, cities, were, victims, of, divine, punishment, being, visited, with, heaven, sent, disasters, famine, and, some, kind, of, disease, in, addition, they, were, slaughtered, by, auxiliaries, sent, by, the, emperor, marcian, and, led, by, aetius, and, at, the, same, time, they, were, crushed, in, their, settlements, thus, crushed, they, made, peace, with, the, romans, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, emperor, marcian, succeeded, theodosius, ii, and, stopped, paying, tribute, to, the, huns, attila, withdrew, from, italy, to, his, palace, across, the, danube, while, making, plans, to, strike, at, constantinople, once, more, to, reclaim, tribute, however, he, died, in, the, early, months, of, 453, the, conventional, account, from, priscus, says, that, attila, was, at, a, feast, celebrating, his, latest, marriage, this, time, to, the, beautiful, young, ildico, the, name, suggests, gothic, or, ostrogoth, origins, 164, in, the, midst, of, the, revels, however, he, suffered, severe, bleeding, and, died, he, may, have, had, a, nosebleed, and, choked, to, death, in, a, stupor, or, he, may, have, succumbed, to, internal, bleeding, possibly, due, to, ruptured, esophageal, varices, esophageal, varices, are, dilated, veins, that, form, in, the, lower, part, of, the, esophagus, often, caused, by, years, of, excessive, alcohol, consumption, they, are, fragile, and, can, easily, rupture, leading, to, death, by, hemorrhage, another, account, of, his, death, was, first, recorded, 80, years, after, the, events, by, roman, chronicler, marcellinus, comes, it, reports, that, attila, king, of, the, huns, and, ravager, of, the, provinces, of, europe, was, pierced, by, the, hand, and, blade, of, his, wife, one, modern, analyst, suggests, that, he, was, assassinated, but, most, reject, these, accounts, as, no, more, than, hearsay, preferring, instead, the, account, given, by, attila, s, contemporary, priscus, recounted, in, the, 6th, century, by, jordanes, on, the, following, day, when, a, great, part, of, the, morning, was, spent, the, royal, attendants, suspected, some, ill, and, after, a, great, uproar, broke, in, the, doors, there, they, found, the, death, of, attila, accomplished, by, an, effusion, of, blood, without, any, wound, and, the, girl, with, downcast, face, weeping, beneath, her, veil, then, as, is, the, custom, of, that, race, they, plucked, out, the, hair, of, their, heads, and, made, their, faces, hideous, with, deep, wounds, that, the, renowned, warrior, might, be, mourned, not, by, effeminate, wailings, and, tears, but, by, the, blood, of, men, moreover, a, wondrous, thing, took, place, in, connection, with, attila, s, death, for, in, a, dream, some, god, stood, at, the, side, of, marcian, emperor, of, the, east, while, he, was, disquieted, about, his, fierce, foe, and, showed, him, the, bow, of, attila, broken, in, that, same, night, as, if, to, intimate, that, the, race, of, huns, owed, much, to, that, weapon, this, account, the, historian, priscus, says, he, accepts, upon, truthful, evidence, for, so, terrible, was, attila, thought, to, be, to, great, empires, that, the, gods, announced, his, death, to, rulers, as, a, special, boon, his, body, was, placed, in, the, midst, of, a, plain, and, lay, in, state, in, a, silken, tent, as, a, sight, for, men, s, admiration, the, best, horsemen, of, the, entire, tribe, of, the, huns, rode, around, in, circles, after, the, manner, of, circus, games, in, the, place, to, which, he, had, been, brought, and, told, of, his, deeds, in, a, funeral, dirge, in, the, following, manner, the, chief, of, the, huns, king, attila, born, of, his, sire, mundiuch, lord, of, bravest, tribes, sole, possessor, of, the, scythian, and, german, realms, powers, unknown, before, captured, cities, and, terrified, both, empires, of, the, roman, world, and, appeased, by, their, prayers, took, annual, tribute, to, save, the, rest, from, plunder, and, when, he, had, accomplished, all, this, by, the, favor, of, fortune, he, fell, not, by, wound, of, the, foe, nor, by, treachery, of, friends, but, in, the, midst, of, his, nation, at, peace, happy, in, his, joy, and, without, sense, of, pain, who, can, rate, this, as, death, when, none, believes, it, calls, for, vengeance, when, they, had, mourned, him, with, such, lamentations, a, strava, as, they, call, it, was, celebrated, over, his, tomb, with, great, reveling, they, gave, way, in, turn, to, the, extremes, of, feeling, and, displayed, funereal, grief, alternating, with, joy, then, in, the, secrecy, of, night, they, buried, his, body, in, the, earth, they, bound, his, coffins, the, first, with, gold, the, second, with, silver, and, the, third, with, the, strength, of, iron, showing, by, such, means, that, these, three, things, suited, the, mightiest, of, kings, iron, because, he, subdued, the, nations, gold, and, silver, because, he, received, the, honors, of, both, empires, they, also, added, the, arms, of, foemen, won, in, the, fight, trappings, of, rare, worth, sparkling, with, various, gems, and, ornaments, of, all, sorts, whereby, princely, state, is, maintained, and, that, so, great, riches, might, be, kept, from, human, curiosity, they, slew, those, appointed, to, the, work, a, dreadful, pay, for, their, labor, and, thus, sudden, death, was, the, lot, of, those, who, buried, him, as, well, as, of, him, who, was, buried, 254, 259, attila, s, sons, ellac, dengizich, and, ernak, in, their, rash, eagerness, to, rule, they, all, alike, destroyed, his, empire, 259, they, were, clamoring, that, the, nations, should, be, divided, among, them, equally, and, that, warlike, kings, with, their, peoples, should, be, apportioned, to, them, by, lot, like, a, family, estate, 259, against, the, treatment, as, slaves, of, the, basest, condition, a, germanic, alliance, led, by, the, gepid, ruler, ardaric, who, was, noted, for, great, loyalty, to, attila, 199, revolted, and, fought, with, the, huns, in, pannonia, in, the, battle, of, nedao, 454, ad, 260, 262, attila, s, eldest, son, ellac, was, killed, in, that, battle, 262, attila, s, sons, regarding, the, goths, as, deserters, from, their, rule, came, against, them, as, though, they, were, seeking, fugitive, slaves, attacked, ostrogothic, co, ruler, valamir, who, also, fought, alongside, ardaric, and, attila, at, the, catalaunian, plains, 199, but, were, repelled, and, some, group, of, huns, moved, to, scythia, probably, those, of, ernak, 268, 269, his, brother, dengizich, attempted, a, renewed, invasion, across, the, danube, in, 468, ad, but, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, bassianae, by, the, ostrogoths, 272, 273, dengizich, was, killed, by, roman, gothic, general, anagast, the, following, year, after, which, the, hunnic, dominion, ended, 168, attila, s, many, children, and, relatives, are, known, by, name, and, some, even, by, deeds, but, soon, valid, genealogical, sources, all, but, dried, up, and, there, seems, to, be, no, verifiable, way, to, trace, attila, s, descendants, this, has, not, stopped, many, genealogists, from, attempting, to, reconstruct, a, valid, line, of, descent, for, various, medieval, rulers, one, of, the, most, credible, claims, has, been, that, of, the, nominalia, of, the, bulgarian, khans, for, mythological, avitohol, and, irnik, from, the, dulo, clan, of, the, bulgars, 103, 59, 142, the, hungarian, rp, d, dynasty, also, claimed, to, be, a, direct, descendant, of, attila, medieval, hungarian, chronicles, from, the, hungarian, royal, court, like, gesta, hungarorum, gesta, hunnorum, et, hungarorum, chronicon, pictum, buda, chronicle, chronica, hungarorum, claimed, that, the, rp, d, dynasty, and, the, aba, clan, are, the, descendants, of, attila, there, is, no, surviving, first, hand, account, of, attila, s, appearance, but, there, is, a, possible, second, hand, source, provided, by, jordanes, who, cites, a, description, given, by, priscus, he, was, a, man, born, into, the, world, to, shake, the, nations, the, scourge, of, all, lands, who, in, some, way, terrified, all, mankind, by, the, dreadful, rumors, noised, abroad, concerning, him, he, was, haughty, in, his, walk, rolling, his, eyes, hither, and, thither, so, that, the, power, of, his, proud, spirit, appeared, in, the, movement, of, his, body, he, was, indeed, a, lover, of, war, yet, restrained, in, action, mighty, in, counsel, gracious, to, suppliants, and, lenient, to, those, who, were, once, received, into, his, protection, short, of, stature, with, a, broad, chest, and, a, large, head, his, eyes, were, small, his, beard, thin, and, sprinkled, with, grey, and, he, had, a, flat, nose, and, swarthy, skin, showing, evidence, of, his, origin, 182, 183, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, these, features, are, typically, east, asian, because, in, combination, they, fit, the, physical, type, of, people, from, eastern, asia, so, attila, s, ancestors, may, have, come, from, there, 202, other, historians, have, suggested, that, the, same, features, may, have, been, typical, of, some, scythian, people, the, name, has, many, variants, in, several, languages, atli, and, atle, in, old, norse, etzel, in, middle, high, german, nibelungenlied, tla, in, old, english, attila, atilla, and, etele, in, hungarian, attila, is, the, most, popular, attila, atilla, atilay, or, atila, in, turkish, and, adil, and,

direct, descendant, of, the, great, hun, leader, attila, medieval, hungarian, chronicles, claimed, that, grand, prince, rp, d, of, hungary, was, the, descendant, of, attila, in, the, 401st, year, of, our, lord, s, birth, in, the, 28th, year, since, the, arrival, of, the, hungarians, in, pannonia, according, to, the, custom, of, the, romans, the, huns, namely, the, hungarians, exalted, attila, as, king, above, themselves, the, son, of, bendeg, z, who, was, before, among, the, captains, and, he, made, his, brother, buda, a, prince, and, a, judge, from, the, river, tisza, to, the, river, don,

happy, to, be, described, as, the, second, attila, the, chronica, hungarorum, by, johannes, thur, czy, set, the, goal, of, glorifying, attila, which, was, undeservedly, neglected, moreover, he, introduced, the, famous, scourge, of, god, characterization, to, the, later, hungarian, writers, because, the, earlier, chronicles, remained, hidden, for, a, long, time, thur, czy, worked, hard, to, endear, attila, the, hun, king, with, an, effort, far, surpassing, his, predecessor, chroniclers, he, made, attila, a, model, for, his, victorious, ruler, king, matthias, of, hungary, who, had, attila, s, abilities, with, this, he, almost, brought, the, hammer, of, the, world, to, life, jordanes, embellished, the, report, of, priscus, reporting, that, attila, had, possessed, the, holy, war, sword, of, the, scythians, which, was, given, to, him, by, mars, and, made, him, a, prince, of, the, entire, world, lampert, of, hersfeld, s, contemporary, chronicles, report, that, shortly, before,

legends, of, ecclesiastical, tradition, according, to, a, version, of, this, narrative, related, in, the, chronicon, pictum, a, mediaeval, hungarian, chronicle, the, pope, promised, attila, that, if, he, left, rome, in, peace, one, of, his, successors, would, receive, a, holy, crown, which, has, been, understood, as, referring, to, the, holy, crown, of, hungary, some, histories, and, chronicles,
