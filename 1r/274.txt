to, several, other, anti, lutheran, books, one, of, more, s, criticisms, of, the, initial, tyndale, translation, was, that, despite, claiming, to, be, in, the, vernacular, tyndale, had, employed, numerous, neologisms, for, example, jehovah, scapegoat, passover, atonement, mercy, seat, shewbread, more, also, accused, tyndale, of, deliberately, avoiding, common, translations, in, favour, of, biased, words, such, as, using, the, emotion, love, instead, of, the, practical, action, charity, for, greek, agape, using, the, neologism, senior, instead, of, priest, for, the, greek, presbyteros, tyndale, changed, this, to, elder, and, the, latinate, congregation, instead, of, church, tyndale, s, bibles, include, text, other, than, the, scriptures, some, of, tyndale, s, prefaces, were, direct,

because, there, was, no, good, latin, word, while, english, had, the, perfectly, fine, church, but, that, the, intent, and, theology, under, the, words, were, all, important, i, have, not, contended, with, erasmus, my, darling, because, i, found, no, such, malicious, intent, with, erasmus, my, darling, as, i, find, with, tyndale, for, had, i, found, with, erasmus, my, darling, the, cunning, intent, and, purpose, that, i, find, in, tyndale, erasmus, my, darling, should, be, no, more, my, darling, but, i, find, in, erasmus, my, darling, that, he, detests, and, abhors, the, errors, and, heresies, that, tyndale, plainly, teaches, and, abides, by, and, therefore, erasmus, my, darling, shall, be, my, dear, darling, still, and, surely, if, tyndale, had, either, never, taught, them, or, yet, had, the, grace, to, revoke, them, then, should, tyndale, be, my, dear, darling, too, but, while, he, holds, such, heresies, still, i, cannot, take, for, my, darling, him, that, the, devil, takes, for, his, darling, as, the, conflict, over, supremacy, between, the, papacy, and, the, king, reached, its, peak, more, continued, to, remain, steadfast, in, supporting, the, supremacy, of, the,

in, 1532, agreed, to, sign, the, oath, but, only, under, threat, of, praemunire, and, only, after, these, words, were, added, as, far, as, the, law, of, christ, allows, this, was, considered, to, be, the, final, submission, of, the, clergy, cardinal, john, fisher, and, some, other, clergy, refused, to, sign, henry, purged, most, clergy, who, supported, the, papal, stance, from, senior, positions,

openly, reject, the, king, s, actions, and, kept, his, opinions, private, on, 16, may, 1532, more, resigned, from, his, role, as, chancellor, but, remained, in, henry, s, favour, despite, his, refusal, his, decision, to, resign, was, caused, by, the, decision, of, the, convocation, of, the, english, church, which, was, under, intense, royal, threat, on, the, day, before, there, is, considerable, variation, in, opinion, on, the, extent, and, nature, of, more, s, prosecution, of, heretics, witness, the, difference, in, portrayals, of, more, in, a, man, for, all, seasons, and, in, wolf, hall, the, english, establishment, initially, regarded, protestants, and, anabaptists, as, akin, to, the, lollards, and, hussites, whose, heresies, fed, their, sedition, ambassador, to, charles,

was, in, effect, the, first, port, of, call, for, those, arrested, in, london, on, suspicion, of, heresy, and, he, took, the, initial, decisions, about, whether, to, release, them, where, to, imprison, them, or, to, which, bishop, to, send, them, he, can, be, connected, with, police, or, judicial, proceedings, against, around, forty, suspected, or, convicted, heretics, in, the, years,

it, was, regarded, as, unsafe, for, evidence, and, was, not, an, allowed, punishment, stories, emerged, in, more, s, lifetime, regarding, persecution, of, the, protestant, heretics, during, his, time, as, lord, chancellor, and, he, denied, them, in, detail, in, his, apologia, 1533, many, stories, were, later, published, by, the, sixteenth, century, english, protestant, historian, john, foxe, in, his, polemical, book, of, martyrs, foxe, was, instrumental, in, publicizing, accusations, of, torture, alleging, that, more, had, often, personally, used, violence, or, torture, while, interrogating, heretics, later, protestant, authors, such, as, brian, moynahan, and, michael, farris, cite, foxe, when, repeating, these, allegations, biographer, peter, ackroyd, also, lists, claims, from, foxe, s, book, of, martyrs, and, other, post, reformation, sources, that, more, tied, heretics, to, a, tree, in, his, chelsea, garden, and, whipped, them, that, he, watched, as, newe, men, were, put, upon, the, rack, in, the, tower, and, tortured, until, they, confessed, and, that, he, was, personally, responsible, for, the, burning, of, several, of, the, brethren, in, smithfield, 305, historian, john, guy, commented, that, such, charges, are, unsupported, by, independent, proof, modern, historian, diarmaid, macculloch, finds, no, evidence, that, he, was, directly, involved, in, torture, richard, marius, records, a, similar, claim, which, tells, about, james, bainham, and, writes, that, the, story, foxe, told, of, bainham, s, whipping, and, racking, at, more, s, hands, is, universally, doubted, today, more, himself, denied, these, allegations, stories, of, a, similar, nature, were, current, even, in, more, s, lifetime, and, he, denied, them, forcefully, he, admitted, that, he, did, imprison, heretics, in, his, house, theyr, sure, kepynge, he, called, it, but, he, utterly, rejected, claims, of, torture, and, whipping, as, help, me, god, 298, 299, more, instead, claimed, in, his, apology, 1533, that, he, only, applied, corporal, punishment, to, two, heretics, a, child, servant, in, his, household, who, was, caned, the, customary, punishment, for, children, at, that, time, for, repeating, a, heresy, regarding, the, eucharist, and, a, feeble, minded, man, who, was, whipped, for, disrupting, the, mass, by, raising, women, s, skirts, over, their, heads, at, the, moment, of,

of, burning, 298, richard, marius, maintained, that, in, office, more, did, everything, in, his, power, to, bring, about, the, extermination, of, heretics, during, more, s, chancellorship, six, people, were, burned, at, the, stake, for, heresy, the, same, rate, as, under, wolsey, they, were, thomas, hitton, thomas, bilney, richard, bayfield, john, tewkesbury, thomas, dusgate, and, james, bainham, 299, 306, however, the, court, of, the, star, chamber, of, which, more, as, lord, chancellor, was, the, presiding, judge, could, not, impose, the, death, sentence, it, was, a, kind, of, appellate, supreme, court, 263, more, took, a, personal, interest, in, the, three, london, cases, 105, historian, brian, moynahan, alleged, that, more, influenced, the, eventual, execution, of, william, tyndale, in, the, duchy, of, brabant, as, english, agents, had, long, pursued, tyndale, he, named, henry, phillips, a, student, at, the, university, of, louvain, and, follower, of, bishop, stokesley, as, the, man, more, commissioned, to, befriend, tyndale, and, then, betray, him, this, was, notwithstanding, that, the, execution, took, place, on, 6, october, 1536, sixteen, months, after, more, himself, had, been, executed, and, in, a, different, jurisdiction, historian, richard, rex, argues, that, linking, the, execution, to, more, was, bizarre, 93, modern, commentators, have, been, divided, over, more, s, character, and, actions, some, biographers, including, peter, ackroyd, have, taken, a, relatively, tolerant, or, even, positive, view, of, more, s, campaign, against, protestantism, by, placing, his, actions, within, the, turbulent, religious, climate, of, the, time, and, the, threat, of, deadly, catastrophes, such, as, the, german, peasants, revolt, which, more,
