of, trade, saw, no, need, to, maintain, significant, naval, forces, this, was, later, to, prove, costly, when, in, 1629, he, attacked, and, attempted, to, drive, the, dutch, out, of, their, base, at, the, coastal, city, of, jakarta, though, he, possessed, larger, and, superior, land, based, forces, the, dutch, had, decisive, advantages, in, naval, power, and, were, able, to, withstand, the, siege, of, batavia, after, the, failure, of, the, siege, agung, turned, against, the, balinese, then, controlling, balambangan, in, east, java, in, a, holy, war, against, infidels, his, campaign, was,
