preacher, active, in, renaissance, florence, he, became, known, for, his, prophecies, of, civic, glory, his, advocacy, of, the, destruction, of, secular, art, and, culture, and, his, calls, for, christian, renewal, he, denounced, clerical, corruption, despotic, rule, and, the, exploitation, of, the, poor, in, september, 1494, when, king, charles, viii, of, france, invaded, italy, and, threatened, florence, savonarola, s, prophecies, seemed, on, the, verge, of, fulfillment, while, the, friar, intervened, with, the, french, king, the, florentines, expelled, the, ruling, medicis, and, at, savonarola, s, urging, established, a, well, received, republic, effectively, under, savonarola, s, control, declaring, that, florence, would, be, the, new, jerusalem, the, world, centre, of, christianity, and, richer, more, powerful, more, glorious, than, ever, he, instituted, an, extreme, moralistic, campaign, enlisting, the, active, help, of, florentine, youth, in, 1495, when, florence, refused, to, join, pope, alexander, vi, s, holy, league, against, the, french, the, vatican, summoned, savonarola, to, rome, he, disobeyed, and, further, defied, the, pope, by, preaching, under, a, ban, highlighting, his, campaign, for, reform, with, processions, bonfires, of, the, vanities, and, pious, theatricals, in, retaliation, pope, alexander, excommunicated, savonarola, in, may, 1497, and, threatened, to, place, florence, under, an, interdict, a, trial, by, fire, proposed, by, a, rival, florentine, preacher, in, april, 1498, to, test, savonarola, s, divine, mandate, turned, into, a, fiasco, and, popular, opinion, turned, against, him, savonarola, and, two, of, his, supporting, friars, were, imprisoned, on, 23, may, 1498, church, and, civil, authorities, condemned, hanged, and, burned, the, bodies, of, the, three, friars, in, the, main, square, of, florence, savonarola, s, devotees, the, piagnoni, kept, his, cause, of, republican, freedom, and, religious, reform, alive, well, into, the, following, century, pope, julius, ii, in, office, 1503, 1513, allegedly, considered, his, canonization, however, the, medici, restored, to, power, in, florence, in, 1512, with, the, help, of, the, papacy, eventually, weakened, the, piagnoni, movement, some, early, protestants, including, martin, luther, himself, have, regarded, savonarola, as, a, vital, precursor, to, the, protestant, reformation, the, cause, for, his, canonization, is, currently, being, studied, by, the, holy, see, which, has, accorded, him, the, title, of, servant, of, god, savonarola, was, born, on, 21, september, 1452, in, ferrara, to, niccol, di, michele, and, elena, his, father, niccol, was, born, in, ferrara, to, a, family, originally, from, padua, his, mother, elena, claimed, a, lineage, from, the, bonacossi, family, of, mantua, she, and, niccol, had, seven, children, of, whom, girolamo, was, third, his, grandfather, michele, savonarola, a, noted, and, successful, physician, and, polymath, oversaw, girolamo, s, education, the, family, amassed, a, great, deal, of, wealth, from, michele, s, medical, practice, after, his, grandfather, s, death, in, 1468, savonarola, may, have, attended, the, public, school, run, by, battista, guarino, son, of, guarino, da, verona, where, he, would, have, received, his, introduction, to, the, classics, as, well, as, to, the, poetry, and, writings, of, petrarch, father, of, renaissance, humanism, earning, an, arts, degree, at, the, university, of, ferrara, he, prepared, to, enter, medical, school, following, in, his, grandfather, s, footsteps, at, some, point, however, he, abandoned, his, career, intentions, in, his, early, poems, he, expresses, his, preoccupation, with, the, state, of, the, church, and, of, the, world, he, began, to, write, poetry, of, an, apocalyptic, bent, notably, on, the, ruin, of, the, world, 1472, and, on, the, ruin, of, the, church, 1475, in, which, he, singled, out, the, papal, court, at, rome, for, special, obloquy, about, the, same, time, he, seems, to, have, been, thinking, about, a, life, in, religion, as, he, later, told, his, biographer, a, sermon, he, heard, by, a, preacher, in, faenza, persuaded, him, to, abandon, the, world, most, of, his, biographers, reject, or, ignore, the, account, of, his, younger, brother, and, follower, maurelio, later, fra, mauro, that, in, his, youth, girolamo, had, been, spurned, by, a, neighbour, laudomia, strozzi, to, whom, he, had, proposed, marriage, true, or, not, in, a, letter, he, wrote, to, his, father, when, he, left, home, to, join, the, dominican, order, he, hints, at, being, troubled, by, desires, of, the, flesh, there, is, also, a, story, that, on, the, eve, of, his, departure, he, dreamed, that, he, was, cleansed, of, such, thoughts, by, a, shower, of, icy, water, which, prepared, him, for, the, ascetic, life, in, the, unfinished, treatise, he, left, behind, later, called, de, contemptu, mundi, or, on, contempt, for, the, world, he, calls, upon, readers, to, fly, from, this, world, of, adultery, sodomy, murder, and, envy, savonarola, studied, augustine, and, thomas, aquinas, he, also, studied, the, scriptures, and, memorised, parts, on, 25, april, 1475, girolamo, savonarola, went, to, bologna, where, he, knocked, on, the, door, of, the, friary, of, san, domenico, of, the, order, of, friars, preacher, and, asked, to, be, admitted, as, he, told, his, father, in, his, farewell, letter, he, wanted, to, become, a, knight, of, christ, in, the, convent, savonarola, took, the, vow, of, obedience, proper, to, his, order, and, after, a, year, was, ordained, to, the, priesthood, he, studied, scripture, logic, aristotelian, philosophy, and, thomistic, theology, in, the, dominican, studium, practised, preaching, to, his, fellow, friars, and, engaged, in, disputations, he, then, matriculated, in, the, theological, faculty, to, prepare, for, an, advanced, degree, even, as, he, continued, to, write, devotional, works, and, to, deepen, his, spiritual, life, he, was, openly, critical, of, what, he, perceived, as, the, decline, in, convent, austerity, in, 1478, his, studies, were, interrupted, when, he, was, sent, to, the, dominican, priory, of, santa, maria, degli, angeli, in, ferrara, as, assistant, master, of, novices, the, assignment, might, have, been, a, normal, temporary, break, from, the, academic, routine, but, in, savonarola, s, case, it, was, a, turning, point, one, explanation, is, that, he, had, alienated, certain, of, his, superiors, particularly, fra, vincenzo, bandelli, or, bandello, a, professor, at, the, studium, and, future, master, general, of, the, dominicans, who, resented, the, young, friar, s, opposition, to, modifying, the, order, s, rules, against, the, ownership, of, property, in, 1482, instead, of, returning, to, bologna, to, resume, his, studies, savonarola, was, assigned, as, lector, or, teacher, in, the, convent, of, san, marco, in, florence, in, san, marco, fra, girolamo, savonarola, taught, logic, to, the, novices, wrote, instructional, manuals, on, ethics, logic, philosophy, and, government, composed, devotional, works, and, prepared, his, sermons, for, local, congregations, as, he, recorded, in, his, notes, his, preaching, was, not, altogether, successful, florentines, were, put, off, by, his, foreign, sounding, ferrarese, speech, his, strident, voice, and, especially, to, those, who, valued, humanist, rhetoric, his, inelegant, style, while, waiting, for, a, friend, in, the, convent, of, san, giorgio, he, was, studying, scripture, when, he, suddenly, conceived, about, seven, reasons, why, the, church, was, about, to, be, scourged, and, renewed, he, broached, these, apocalyptic, themes, in, san, gimignano, where, he, went, as, lenten, preacher, in, 1485, and, again, in, 1486, but, a, year, later, when, he, left, san, marco, for, a, new, assignment, he, had, said, nothing, of, his, san, giorgio, revelations, in, florence, for, the, next, several, years, savonarola, lived, as, an, itinerant, preacher, with, a, message, of, repentance, and, reform, in, the, cities, and, convents, of, north, italy, as, his, letters, to, his, mother, and, his, writings, show, his, confidence, and, sense, of, mission, grew, along, with, his, widening, reputation, in, 1490, he, was, reassigned, to, san, marco, it, seems, that, this, was, due, to, the, initiative, of, the, humanist, philosopher, prince, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, who, had, heard, savonarola, in, a, formal, disputation, in, reggio, emilia, and, been, impressed, with, his, learning, and, piety, pico, was, in, trouble, with, the, church, for, some, of, his, unorthodox, philosophical, ideas, the, famous, 900, theses, and, was, living, under, the, protection, of, lorenzo, the, magnificent, the, medici, de, facto, ruler, of, florence, to, have, savonarola, beside, him, as, a, spiritual, counsellor, he, persuaded, lorenzo, that, the, friar, would, bring, prestige, to, the, convent, of, san, marco, and, its, medici, patrons, after, some, delay, apparently, due, to, the, interference, of, his, former, professor, fra, vincenzo, bandelli, now, vicar, general, of, the, order, lorenzo, succeeded, in, bringing, savonarola, back, to, florence, where, he, arrived, in, may, or, june, of, that, year, savonarola, preached, on, the, first, epistle, of, john, and, on, the, book, of, revelation, drawing, such, large, crowds, that, he, eventually, moved, to, the, cathedral, without, mentioning, names, he, made, pointed, allusions, to, tyrants, who, usurped, the, freedom, of, the, people, and, he, excoriated, their, allies, the, rich, and, powerful, who, neglected, and, exploited, the, poor, complaining, of, the, evil, lives, of, a, corrupt, clergy, he, now, called, for, repentance, and, renewal, before, the, arrival, of, a, divine, scourge, scoffers, dismissed, him, as, an, over, excited, zealot, and, preacher, of, the, desperate, and, sneered, at, his, growing, band, of, followers, as, piagnoni, weepers, or, wailers, an, epithet, they, adopted, in, 1492, savonarola, warned, of, the, sword, of, the, lord, over, the, earth, quickly, and, soon, and, envisioned, terrible, tribulations, to, rome, around, 1493, these, sermons, have, not, survived, he, began, to, prophesy, that, a, new, cyrus, was, coming, over, the, mountains, to, begin, the, renewal, of, the, church, in, september, 1494, king, charles, viii, of, france, crossed, the, alps, with, a, formidable, army, throwing, italy, into, political, chaos, many, viewed, the, arrival, of, king, charles, as, proof, of, savonarola, s, gift, of, prophecy, charles, advanced, on, florence, sacking, tuscan, strongholds, and, threatening, to, punish, the, city, for, refusing, to, support, his, expedition, as, the, populace, took, to, the, streets, to, expel, piero, the, unfortunate, lorenzo, de, medici, s, son, and, successor, savonarola, led, a, delegation, to, the, camp, of, the, french, king, in, mid, november, 1494, he, pressed, charles, to, spare, florence, and, enjoined, him, to, take, up, his, divinely, appointed, role, as, the, reformer, of, the, church, after, a, short, tense, occupation, of, the, city, and, another, intervention, by, fra, girolamo, as, well, as, the, promise, of, a, huge, subsidy, the, french, resumed, their, journey, southward, on, 28, november, 1494, savonarola, now, declared, that, by, answering, his, call, to, penitence, the, florentines, had, begun, to, build, a, new, ark, of, noah, which, had, saved, them, from, the, waters, of, the, divine, flood, even, more, sensational, was, the, message, in, his, sermon, of, 10, december, i, announce, this, good, news, to, the, city, that, florence, will, be, more, glorious, richer, more, powerful, than, she, has, ever, been, first, glorious, in, the, sight, of, god, as, well, as, of, men, and, you, o, florence, will, be, the, reformation, of, all, italy, and, from, here, the, renewal, will, begin, and, spread, everywhere, because, this, is, the, navel, of, italy, your, counsels, will, reform, all, by, the, light, and, grace, that, god, will, give, you, second, o, florence, you, will, have, innumerable, riches, and, god, will, multiply, all, things, for, you, third, you, will, spread, your, empire, and, thus, you, will, have, power, temporal, and, spiritual, this, astounding, guarantee, may, have, been, an, allusion, to, the, traditional, patriotic, myth, of, florence, as, the, new, rome, which, savonarola, would, have, encountered, in, his, readings, in, florentine, history, in, any, case, it, encompassed, both, temporal, power, and, spiritual, leadership, with, savonarola, s, advice, and, support, as, a, non, citizen, and, cleric, he, was, ineligible, to, hold, office, a, savonarolan, political, party, dubbed, the, frateschi, took, shape, and, steered, the, friar, s, program, through, the, councils, the, oligarchs, most, compromised, by, their, service, to, the, medici, were, barred, from, office, a, new, constitution, enfranchised, the, artisan, class, opened, minor, civic, offices, to, selection, by, lot, and, granted, every, citizen, in, good, standing, the, right, to, a, vote, in, a, new, parliament, the, consiglio, maggiore, or, great, council, at, savonarola, s, urging, the, frateschi, government, after, months, of, debate, passed, a, law, of, appeal, to, limit, the, longtime, practice, of, using, exile, and, capital, punishment, as, factional, weapons, savonarola, declared, a, new, era, of, universal, peace, on, 13, january, 1495, he, preached, his, great, renovation, sermon, to, a, huge, audience, in, the, cathedral, recalling, that, he, had, begun, prophesying, in, florence, four, years, earlier, although, the, divine, light, had, come, to, him, more, than, fifteen, maybe, twenty, years, ago, he, now, claimed, that, he, had, predicted, the, deaths, of, lorenzo, de, medici, and, of, pope, innocent, viii, in, 1492, and, the, coming, of, the, sword, to, italy, the, invasion, of, king, charles, of, france, as, he, had, foreseen, god, had, chosen, florence, the, navel, of, italy, as, his, favourite, and, he, repeated, if, the, city, continued, to, do, penance, and, began, the, work, of, renewal, it, would, have, riches, glory, and, power, if, the, florentines, had, any, doubt, that, the, promise, of, worldly, power, and, glory, had, heavenly, sanction, savonarola, emphasised, this, in, a, sermon, of, 1, april, 1495, in, which, he, described, his, mystical, journey, to, the, virgin, mary, in, heaven, at, the, celestial, throne, savonarola, presents, the, holy, mother, a, crown, made, by, the, florentine, people, and, presses, her, to, reveal, their, future, mary, warns, that, the, way, will, be, hard, both, for, the, city, and, for, him, but, she, assures, him, that, god, will, fulfil, his, promises, florence, will, be, more, glorious, more, powerful, and, richer, than, ever, extending, its, wings, farther, than, anyone, can, imagine, she, and, her, heavenly, minions, will, protect, the, city, against, its, enemies, and, support, its, alliance, with, the, french, in, the, new, jerusalem, that, is, florence, peace, and, unity, will, reign, based, on, such, visions, savonarola, promoted, theocracy, and, declared, christ, the, king, of, florence, he, saw, sacred, art, as, a, tool, to, promote, this, worldview, and, he, was, therefore, only, opposed, to, secular, art, which, he, saw, as, worthless, and, potentially, damaging, buoyed, by, liberation, and, prophetic, promise, the, florentines, embraced, savonarola, s, campaign, to, rid, the, city, of, vice, at, his, repeated, insistence, new, laws, were, passed, against, sodomy, which, included, male, and, female, same, sex, relations, adultery, public, drunkenness, and, other, moral, transgressions, while, his, lieutenant, fra, silvestro, maruffi, organised, boys, and, young, men, to, patrol, the, streets, to, curb, immodest, dress, and, behaviour, for, a, time, pope, alexander, vi, 1492, 1503, tolerated, friar, girolamo, s, strictures, against, the, church, but, he, was, moved, to, anger, when, florence, declined, to, join, his, new, holy, league, against, the, french, invader, and, blamed, it, on, savonarola, s, pernicious, influence, an, exchange, of, letters, between, the, pope, and, the, friar, ended, in, an, impasse, which, savonarola, tried, to, break, by, sending, the, pope, a, little, book, recounting, his, prophetic, career, and, describing, some, of, his, more, dramatic, visions, this, was, the, compendium, of, revelations, a, self, dramatisation, which, was, one, of, the, farthest, reaching, and, most, popular, of, his, writings, the, pope, was, not, mollified, he, summoned, the, friar, to, appear, before, him, in, rome, and, when, savonarola, refused, pleading, ill, health, and, confessing, that, he, was, afraid, of, being, attacked, on, the, journey, alexander, banned, him, from, further, preaching, for, some, months, savonarola, obeyed, but, when, he, saw, his, influence, slipping, he, defied, the, pope, and, resumed, his, sermons, which, became, more, violent, in, tone, he, not, only, attacked, secret, enemies, at, home, whom, he, rightly, suspected, of, being, in, league, with, the, papal, curia, he, condemned, the, conventional, or, tepid, christians, who, were, slow, to, respond, to, his, calls, he, dramatised, his, moral, campaign, with, special, masses, for, the, youth, processions, bonfires, of, the, vanities, and, religious, theatre, in, san, marco, he, and, his, close, friend, the, humanist, poet, girolamo, benivieni, composed, lauds, and, other, devotional, songs, for, the, carnival, processions, of, 1496, 1497, and, 1498, replacing, the, bawdy, carnival, songs, of, the, era, of, lorenzo, de, medici, these, continued, to, be, copied, and, performed, after, his, death, along, with, songs, composed, by, piagnoni, in, his, memory, a, number, of, them, have, survived, savonarola, like, the, later, reformers, desired, a, return, to, the, early, apostolic, simplicity, many, protestants, view, savonarola, as, a, precursor, to, the, protestant, reformation, with, respect, to, his, views, on, the, doctrine, of, justification, his, emphasis, on, individual, faith, his, emphasis, on, the, authority, of, scripture, and, compassion, for, the, poor, the, writings, of, savonarola, spread, widely, to, germany, and, switzerland, and, due, to, savonarola, s, life, and, death, many, people, started, to, see, the, papacy, as, corrupted, and, sought, a, new, reform, of, the, church, many, people, saw, him, as, a, martyr, including, martin, luther, who, was, influenced, by, savonarola, s, writings, savonarola, s, beliefs, on, the, doctrine, of, justification, are, similar, in, some, respects, to, martin, luther, s, teachings, stating, that, humans, are, not, justified, by, themselves, savonarola, may, have, influenced, john, calvin, but, this, is, a, matter, of, historical, debate, savonarola, never, abandoned, the, dogmas, of, the, roman, catholic, church, for, example, savonarola, held, to, a, belief, in, seven, sacraments, and, that, the, church, of, rome, is, the, mother, of, all, other, churches, and, the, pope, its, head, however, his, protests, against, papal, corruption, and, his, reliance, on, the, bible, as, the, main, guide, link, savonarola, with, the, later, reformation, savonarola, himself, held, scripture, as, a, very, high, authority, he, himself, stated, i, preach, the, regeneration, of, the, church, taking, the, scriptures, as, my, sole, guide, it, is, untrue, that, god, s, grace, is, obtained, by, pre, existing, works, of, merit, as, though, works, and, deserts, were, the, cause, of, predestination, on, the, contrary, these, are, the, result, of, predestination, the, original, text, can, be, found, in, prato, sermoni, e, prediche, predica, 8, tell, me, peter, tell, me, o, magdalene, wherefore, are, ye, in, paradise, confess, that, not, by, your, own, merits, have, ye, obtained, salvation, but, by, the, goodness, of, god, id, predica, 9, other, quotes, from, savonarola, such, as, not, by, their, own, deservings, o, lord, or, by, their, own, works, have, they, been, saved, lest, any, man, should, be, able, to, boast, but, because, it, seemed, good, in, thy, sight, made, martin, luther, say, that, even, though, the, theology, of, savonarola, was, not, perfect, it, was, still, an, example, of, true, christian, theology, martin, luther, later, stated, about, savonarola, christ, canonizes, savonarola, through, us, even, though, popes, and, papists, burst, to, pieces, over, it, martin, luther, savonarola, while, revering, the, office, of, the, papacy, nevertheless, criticised, the, pope, alexander, vi, and, his, papal, court, savonarola, even, prophesied, that, rome, will, come, under, judgement, from, god, the, pope, may, command, me, to, do, something, that, contravenes, the, law, of, christian, love, or, the, gospel, but, if, he, did, so, command, i, would, say, to, him, thou, art, no, shepherd, not, the, roman, church, but, thou, errest, who, are, the, fat, kine, of, bashan, on, the, mountains, of, samaria, i, say, they, are, the, courtesans, of, italy, and, rome, or, are, there, none, a, thousand, are, too, few, for, rome, 10, 000, 12, 000, 14, 000, are, too, few, for, rome, prepare, thyself, o, rome, for, great, will, be, thy, punishments, girolamo, savonarola, catholic, sources, however, criticize, the, inclusion, of, savonarola, as, a, protestant, forerunner, because, much, of, his, theology, still, aligned, with, rome, despite, inspiring, some, protestant, reformers, savonarola, also, influenced, some, leaders, of, the, counter, reformation, on, 12, may, 1497, pope, alexander, vi, excommunicated, savonarola, and, threatened, the, florentines, with, an, interdict, if, they, persisted, in, harbouring, him, after, describing, the, church, as, a, whore, savonarola, was, excommunicated, for, heresy, and, sedition, on, 18, march, 1498, after, much, debate, and, steady, pressure, from, a, worried, government, savonarola, withdrew, from, public, preaching, under, the, stress, of, excommunication, he, composed, his, spiritual, masterpiece, the, triumph, of, the, cross, a, celebration, of, the, victory, of, the, cross, over, sin, and, death, and, an, exploration, of, what, it, means, to, be, a, christian, this, he, summed, up, in, the, theological, virtue, of, caritas, or, love, in, loving, their, neighbours, christians, return, the, love, which, they, have, received, from, their, creator, and, savior, savonarola, hinted, at, performing, miracles, to, prove, his, divine, mission, but, when, a, rival, franciscan, preacher, proposed, to, test, that, mission, by, walking, through, fire, he, lost, control, of, public, discourse, without, consulting, him, his, confidant, fra, domenico, da, pescia, offered, himself, as, his, surrogate, and, savonarola, felt, he, could, not, afford, to, refuse, the, first, trial, by, fire, in, florence, in, over, four, hundred, years, was, set, for, 7, april, a, crowd, filled, the, central, square, eager, to, see, if, god, would, intervene, and, if, so, on, which, side, the, nervous, contestants, and, their, delegations, delayed, the, start, of, the, contest, for, hours, a, sudden, rain, drenched, the, spectators, and, government, officials, cancelled, the, proceedings, the, crowd, disbanded, angrily, the, burden, of, proof, had, been, on, savonarola, and, he, was, blamed, for, the, fiasco, a, mob, assaulted, the, convent, of, san, marco, fra, girolamo, fra, domenico, and, fra, silvestro, maruffi, were, arrested, and, imprisoned, under, torture, savonarola, confessed, to, having, invented, his, prophecies, and, visions, then, recanted, then, confessed, again, in, his, prison, cell, in, the, tower, of, the, government, palace, he, composed, meditations, on, psalms, 51, infelix, ego, and, 31, tristitia, obsedit, me, on, the, morning, of, 23, may, 1498, the, three, friars, were, led, out, into, the, main, square, where, before, a, tribunal, of, high, clerics, and, government, officials, they, were, condemned, as, heretics, and, schismatics, and, sentenced, to, die, forthwith, stripped, of, their, dominican, garments, in, ritual, degradation, they, mounted, the, scaffold, in, their, thin, white, shirts, each, on, separate,
