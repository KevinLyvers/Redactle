literary, circles, receiving, encouragement, from, sidney, colvin, andrew, lang, edmund, gosse, leslie, stephen, and, w, e, henley, the, last, of, whom, may, have, provided, the, model, for, long, john, silver, in, treasure, island, in, 1890, he, settled, in, samoa, where, alarmed, at, increasing, european, and, american, influence, in, the, south, sea, islands, his, writing, turned, from,

alan, and, david, were, in, the, same, field, thomas, s, maternal, grandfather, thomas, smith, had, been, in, the, same, profession, however, robert, s, mother, s, family, were, gentry, tracing, their, lineage, back, to, alexander, balfour, who, had, held, the, lands, of, inchrye, in, fife, in, the, fifteenth, century, his, mother, s, father, lewis, balfour, 1777, 1860, was, a, minister, of, the, church, of, scotland, at, nearby, colinton, and, her, siblings, included, physician, george, william, balfour, and, marine, engineer, james, balfour, stevenson, spent, the, greater, part, of, his, boyhood, holidays, in, his, maternal, grandfather, s, house, now, i, often, wonder, what, i, inherited, from, this, old, minister, stevenson, wrote, i, must, suppose, indeed, that, he, was, fond, of, preaching, sermons, and, so, am, i, though, i, never, heard, it, maintained, that, either, of, us, loved, to, hear, them, lewis, balfour, and, his, daughter, both, had, weak, chests, so, they, often, needed, to, stay, in, warmer, climates, for, their, health, stevenson, inherited, a, tendency, to, coughs, and, fevers, exacerbated, when, the, family, moved, to, a, damp, chilly, house, at, 1, inverleith, terrace, in, 1851, the, family, moved, again, to, the, sunnier, 17, heriot, row, when, stevenson, was, six, years, old, but, the, tendency, to, extreme, sickness, in, winter, remained, with, him, until, he, was, 11, illness, was, a, recurrent, feature, of, his, adult, life, and, left, him, extraordinarily, thin, contemporaneous, views, were, that, he, had, tuberculosis, but, more, recent, views, are, that, it, was, bronchiectasis, or, sarcoidosis, the, family, also, summered, in, the, spa, town, of, bridge, of, allan, in, north, berwick, and, in, peebles, for, the, sake, of, stevenson, s, and, his, mother, s, health, stevenson, s, cave, in, bridge, of, allan, was, reportedly, the, inspiration, for, the, character, ben, gunn, s, cave, dwelling, in, stevenson, s, 1883, novel, treasure, island, stevenson, s, parents, were, both, devout, presbyterians, but, the, household, was, not, strict, in, its, adherence, to, calvinist, principles, his, nurse, alison, cunningham, known, as, cummy, was, more, fervently, religious, her, mix, of, calvinism, and, folk, beliefs, were, an, early, source, of, nightmares, for, the, child, and, he, showed, a, precocious, concern, for, religion, but, she, also, cared, for, him, tenderly, in, illness, reading, to, him, from, john, bunyan, and, the, bible, as, he, lay, sick, in, bed, and, telling, tales, of, the, covenanters, stevenson, recalled, this, time, of, sickness, in, the, land, of, counterpane, in, a, child, s, garden, of, verses, 1885, dedicating, the, book, to, his, nurse, stevenson, was, an, only, child, both, strange, looking, and, eccentric, and, he, found, it, hard, to, fit, in, when, he, was, sent, to, a, nearby, school, at, age, 6, a, problem, repeated, at, age, 11, when, he, went, on, to, the, edinburgh, academy, but, he, mixed, well, in, lively, games, with, his, cousins, in, summer, holidays, at, colinton, his, frequent, illnesses, often, kept, him, away, from, his, first, school, so, he, was, taught, for, long, stretches, by, private, tutors, he, was, a, late, reader, learning, at, age, 7, or, 8, but, even, before, this, he, dictated, stories, to, his, mother, and, nurse, and, he, compulsively, wrote, stories, throughout, his, childhood, his, father, was, proud, of, this, interest, he, had, also, written, stories, in, his, spare, time, until, his, own, father, had, found, them, and, had, told, him, to, give, up, such, nonsense, and, mind, your, business, he, paid, for, the, printing, of, robert, s, first, publication, at, 16, entitled, the, pentland, rising, a, page, of, history, 1666, it, was, an, account, of, the, covenanters, rebellion, and, was, published, in, 1866, the, 200th, anniversary, of, the, event, in, september, 1857, when, he, was, six, years, old, stevenson, went, to, mr, henderson, s, school, in, india, street, edinburgh, but, because, of, poor, health, stayed, only, a, few, weeks, and, did, not, return, until, october, 1859, aged, eight, during, his, many, absences, he, was, taught, by, private, tutors, in, october, 1861, aged, ten, he, went, to, edinburgh, academy, an, independent, school, for, boys, and, stayed, there, sporadically, for, about, fifteen, months, in, the, autumn, of, 1863, he, spent, one, term, at, an, english, boarding, school, at, spring, grove, in, isleworth, in, middlesex, now, an, urban, area, of, west, london, in, october, 1864, following, an, improvement, to, his, health, the, 13, year, old, was, sent, to, robert, thomson, s, private, school, in, frederick, street, edinburgh, where, he, remained, until, he, went, to, university, in, november, 1867, stevenson, entered, the, university, of, edinburgh, to, study, engineering, from, the, start, he, showed, no, enthusiasm, for, his, studies, and, devoted, much, energy, to, avoiding, lectures, this, time, was, more, important, for, the, friendships, he, made, with, other, students, in, the, speculative, society, an, exclusive, debating, club, particularly, with, charles, baxter, who, would, become, stevenson, s, financial, agent, and, with, a, professor, fleeming, jenkin, whose, house, staged, amateur, drama, in, which, stevenson, took, part, and, whose, biography, he, would, later, write, perhaps, most, important, at, this, point, in, his, life, was, a, cousin, robert, alan, mowbray, stevenson, known, as, bob, a, lively, and, light, hearted, young, man, who, instead, of, the, family, profession, had, chosen, to, study, art, in, 1867, stevenson, s, family, took, a, lease, on, swanston, cottage, in, the, village, of, swanston, at, the, foot, of, the, pentland, hills, for, use, as, a, summer, holiday, home, they, held, the, lease, until, 1880, during, their, tenancy, the, young, robert, louis, made, frequent, use, of, the, cottage, being, attracted, by, the, quiet, country, life, and, the, feeling, of, remoteness, it, is, likely, that, the, time, he, spent, there, influenced, his, later, writing, as, well, as, his, wider, outlook, on, life, particularly, his, love, of, nature, and, of, wild, places, the, house, and, its, romantic, location, are, thought, to, have, inspired, several, of, his, works, each, year, during, his, university, holidays, stevenson, also, travelled, to, inspect, the, family, s, engineering, works, in, 1868, this, took, him, to, anstruther, and, for, a, stay, of, six, weeks, in, wick, where, his, family, was, building, a, sea, wall, and, had, previously, built, a, lighthouse, he, was, to, return, to, wick, several, times, over, his, lifetime, and, included, it, in, his, travel, writings, he, also, accompanied, his, father, on, his, official, tour, of, orkney, and, shetland, islands, lighthouses, in, 1869, and, spent, three, weeks, on, the, island, of, erraid, in, 1870, he, enjoyed, the, travels, more, for, the, material, they, gave, for, his, writing, than, for, any, engineering, interest, the, voyage, with, his, father, pleased, him, because, a, similar, journey, of, walter, scott, with, robert, stevenson, had, provided, the, inspiration, for, scott, s, 1822, novel, the, pirate, in, april, 1871, stevenson, notified, his, father, of, his, decision, to, pursue, a, life, of, letters, though, the, elder, stevenson, was, naturally, disappointed, the, surprise, cannot, have, been, great, and, stevenson, s, mother, reported, that, he, was, wonderfully, resigned, to, his, son, s, choice, to, provide, some, security, it, was, agreed, that, stevenson, should, read, law, again, at, edinburgh, university, and, be, called, to, the, scottish, bar, in, his, 1887, poetry, collection, underwoods, stevenson, muses, on, his, having, turned, from, the, family, profession, say, not, of, me, that, weakly, i, declined, the, labours, of, my, sires, and, fled, the, sea, the, towers, we, founded, and, the, lamps, we, lit, to, play, at, home, with, paper, like, a, child, but, rather, say, in, the, afternoon, of, time, a, strenuous, family, dusted, from, its, hands, the, sand, of, granite, and, beholding, far, along, the, sounding, coast, its, pyramids, and, tall, memorials, catch, the, dying, sun, smiled, well, content, and, to, this, childish, task, around, the, fire, addressed, its, evening, hours, in, other, respects, too, stevenson, was, moving, away, from, his, upbringing, his, dress, became, more, bohemian, he, already, wore, his, hair, long, but, he, now, took, to, wearing, a, velveteen, jacket, and, rarely, attended, parties, in, conventional, evening, dress, within, the, limits, of, a, strict, allowance, he, visited, cheap, pubs, and, brothels, more, significantly, he, had, come, to, reject, christianity, and, declared, himself, an, atheist, in, january, 1873, when, he, was, 22, his, father, came, across, the, constitution, of, the, ljr, liberty, justice, reverence, club, of, which, stevenson, and, his, cousin, bob, were, members, which, began, disregard, everything, our, parents, have, taught, us, questioning, his, son, about, his, beliefs, he, discovered, the, truth, stevenson, no, longer, believed, in, god, and, had, grown, tired, of, pretending, to, be, something, he, was, not, am, i, to, live, my, whole, life, as, one, falsehood, his, father, professed, himself, devastated, you, have, rendered, my, whole, life, a, failure, his, mother, accounted, the, revelation, the, heaviest, affliction, to, befall, her, o, lord, what, a, pleasant, thing, it, is, stevenson, wrote, to, his, friend, charles, baxter, to, have, just, damned, the, happiness, of, probably, the, only, two, people, who, care, a, damn, about, you, in, the, world, stevenson, s, rejection, of, the, presbyterian, church, and, christian, dogma, however, did, not, turn, into, lifelong, atheism, or, agnosticism, on, february, 15, 1878, the, 27, year, old, wrote, to, his, father, and, stated, christianity, is, among, other, things, a, very, wise, noble, and, strange, doctrine, of, life, you, see, i, speak, of, it, as, a, doctrine, of, life, and, as, a, wisdom, for, this, world, i, have, a, good, heart, and, believe, in, myself, and, my, fellow, men, and, the, god, who, made, us, all, there, is, a, fine, text, in, the, bible, i, don, t, know, where, to, the, effect, that, all, things, work, together, for, good, for, those, who, love, the, lord, strange, as, it, may, seem, to, you, everything, has, been, in, one, way, or, the, other, bringing, me, nearer, to, what, i, think, you, would, like, me, to, be, tis, a, strange, world, indeed, but, there, is, a, manifest, god, for, those, who, care, to, look, for, him, stevenson, did, not, resume, attending, church, in, scotland, however, he, did, teach, sunday, school, lessons, in, samoa, and, prayers, he, wrote, in, his, final, years, were, published, posthumously, justifying, his, rejection, of, an, established, profession, in, 1877, stevenson, offered, an, apology, for, idlers, a, happy, man, or, woman, he, reasoned, is, a, better, thing, to, find, than, a, five, pound, note, he, or, she, is, a, radiating, focus, of, goodwill, and, a, practical, demonstration, of, the, great, theorem, of, the, liveableness, of, life, so, that, if, they, cannot, be, happy, in, the, handicap, race, for, sixpenny, pieces, let, them, take, their, own, by, road, in, late, 1873, when, he, was, 23, stevenson, was, visiting, a, cousin, in, england, when, he, met, two, people, who, became, very, important, to, him, fanny, frances, jane, sitwell, and, sidney, colvin, sitwell, was, a, 34, year, old, woman, with, a, son, who, was, separated, from, her, husband, she, attracted, the, devotion, of, many, who, met, her, including, colvin, who, married, her, in, 1901, stevenson, was, also, drawn, to, her, and, they, kept, up, a, warm, correspondence, over, several, years, in, which, he, wavered, between, the, role, of, a, suitor, and, a, son, he, addressed, her, as, madonna, colvin, became, stevenson, s, literary, adviser, and, was, the, first, editor, of, his, letters, after, his, death, he, placed, stevenson, s, first, paid, contribution, in, the, portfolio, an, essay, titled, roads, stevenson, was, soon, active, in, london, literary, life, becoming, acquainted, with, many, of, the, writers, of, the, time, including, andrew, lang, edmund, gosse, and, leslie, stephen, the, editor, of, the, cornhill, magazine, who, took, an, interest, in, stevenson, s, work, stephen, took, stevenson, to, visit, a, patient, at, the, edinburgh, infirmary, named, william, ernest, henley, an, energetic, and, talkative, poet, with, a, wooden, leg, henley, became, a, close, friend, and, occasional, literary, collaborator, until, a, quarrel, broke, up, the, friendship, in, 1888, and, he, is, often, considered, to, be, the, inspiration, for, long, john, silver, in, treasure, island, stevenson, was, sent, to, menton, on, the, french, riviera, in, november, 1873, to, recuperate, after, his, health, failed, he, returned, in, better, health, in, april, 1874, and, settled, down, to, his, studies, but, he, returned, to, france, several, times, after, that, he, made, long, and, frequent, trips, to, the, neighbourhood, of, the, forest, of, fontainebleau, staying, at, barbizon, grez, sur, loing, and, nemours, and, becoming, a, member, of, the, artists, colonies, there, he, also, travelled, to, paris, to, visit, galleries, and, the, theatres, he, qualified, for, the, scottish, bar, in, july, 1875, aged, 24, and, his, father, added, a, brass, plate, to, the, heriot, row, house, reading, r, l, stevenson, advocate, his, law, studies, did, influence, his, books, but, he, never, practised, law, all, his, energies, were, spent, in, travel, and, writing, one, of, his, journeys, was, a, canoe, voyage, in, belgium, and, france, with, sir, walter, simpson, a, friend, from, the, speculative, society, a, frequent, travel, companion, and, the, author, of, the, art, of, golf, 1887, this, trip, was, the, basis, of, his, first, travel, book, an, inland, voyage, 1878, stevenson, had, a, long, correspondence, with, fellow, scot, j, m, barrie, he, invited, barrie, to, visit, him, in, samoa, but, the, two, never, met, the, canoe, voyage, with, simpson, brought, stevenson, to, grez, sur, loing, in, september, 1876, where, he, met, fanny, van, de, grift, osbourne, 1840, 1914, born, in, indianapolis, she, had, married, at, age, 17, and, moved, to, nevada, to, rejoin, husband, samuel, after, his, participation, in, the, american, civil, war, their, children, were, isobel, or, belle, lloyd, and, hervey, who, died, in, 1875, but, anger, over, her, husband, s, infidelities, led, to, a, number, of, separations, in, 1875, she, had, taken, her, children, to, france, where, she, and, isobel, studied, art, by, the, time, stevenson, met, her, fanny, was, herself, a, magazine, short, story, writer, of, recognised, ability, stevenson, returned, to, britain, shortly, after, this, first, meeting, but, fanny, apparently, remained, in, his, thoughts, and, he, wrote, the, essay, on, falling, in, love, for, the, cornhill, magazine, they, met, again, early, in, 1877, and, became, lovers, stevenson, spent, much, of, the, following, year, with, her, and, her, children, in, france, in, august, 1878, she, returned, to, san, francisco, and, stevenson, remained, in, europe, making, the, walking, trip, that, formed, the, basis, for, travels, with, a, donkey, in, the, c, vennes, 1879, but, he, set, off, to, join, her, in, august, 1879, aged, 28, against, the, advice, of, his, friends, and, without, notifying, his, parents, he, took, a, second, class, passage, on, the, steamship, devonia, in, part, to, save, money, but, also, to, learn, how, others, travelled, and, to, increase, the, adventure, of, the, journey, he, then, travelled, overland, by, train, from, new, york, city, to, california, he, later, wrote, about, the, experience, in, the, amateur, emigrant, it, was, a, good, experience, for, his, writing, but, it, broke, his, health, he, was, near, death, when, he, arrived, in, monterey, california, where, some, local, ranchers, nursed, him, back, to, health, he, stayed, for, a, time, at, the, french, hotel, located, at, 530, houston, street, now, a, museum, dedicated, to, his, memory, called, the, stevenson, house, while, there, he, often, dined, on, the, cuff, as, he, said, at, a, nearby, restaurant, run, by, frenchman, jules, simoneau, which, stood, at, what, is, now, simoneau, plaza, several, years, later, he, sent, simoneau, an, inscribed, copy, of, his, novel, strange, case, of, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, 1886, writing, that, it, would, be, a, stranger, case, still, if, robert, louis, stevenson, ever, forgot, jules, simoneau, while, in, monterey, he, wrote, an, evocative, article, about, the, old, pacific, capital, of, monterey, by, december, 1879, aged, 29, stevenson, had, recovered, his, health, enough, to, continue, to, san, francisco, where, he, struggled, all, alone, on, forty, five, cents, a, day, and, sometimes, less, with, quantities, of, hard, work, and, many, heavy, thoughts, in, an, effort, to, support, himself, through, his, writing, but, by, the, end, of, the, winter, his, health, was, broken, again, and, he, found, himself, at, death, s, door, fanny, was, now, divorced, and, recovered, from, her, own, illness, and, she, came, to, his, bedside, and, nursed, him, to, recovery, after, a, while, he, wrote, my, spirit, got, up, again, in, a, divine, frenzy, and, has, since, kicked, and, spurred, my, vile, body, forward, with, great, emphasis, and, success, when, his, father, heard, of, his, 28, year, old, son, s, condition, he, cabled, him, money, to, help, him, through, this, period, fanny, and, robert, were, married, in, may, 1880, she, was, 40, he, was, 29, he, said, that, he, was, a, mere, complication, of, cough, and, bones, much, fitter, for, an, emblem, of, mortality, than, a, bridegroom, he, travelled, with, his, new, wife, and, her, son, lloyd, north, of, san, francisco, to, napa, valley, and, spent, a, summer, honeymoon, at, an, abandoned, mining, camp, on, mount, saint, helena, today, designated, robert, louis, stevenson, state, park, he, wrote, about, this, experience, in, the, silverado, squatters, he, met, charles, warren, stoddard, co, editor, of, the, overland, monthly, and, author, of, south, sea, idylls, who, urged, stevenson, to, travel, to, the, south, pacific, an, idea, which, returned, to, him, many, years, later, in, august, 1880, he, sailed, with, fanny, and, lloyd, from, new, york, to, britain, and, found, his, parents, and, his, friend, sidney, colvin, on, the, wharf, at, liverpool, happy, to, see, him, return, home, gradually, his, wife, was, able, to, patch, up, differences, between, father, and, son, and, make, herself, a, part, of, the, family, through, her, charm, and, wit, the, stevensons, shuttled, back, and, forth, between, scotland, and, the, continent, finally, settling, in, 1884, in, the, westbourne, district, of, the, southern, english, seaside, town, of, bournemouth, in, hampshire, now, in, dorset, stevenson, had, moved, there, to, benefit, from, its, sea, air, they, lived, in, a, house, stevenson, named, skerryvore, after, a, scottish, lighthouse, built, by, his, uncle, alan, from, april, 1885, 34, year, old, stevenson, had, the, company, of, the, novelist, henry, james, they, had, met, previously, in, london, and, had, recently, exchanged, views, in, journal, articles, on, the, art, of, fiction, and, thereafter, in, a, correspondence, in, which, they, expressed, their, admiration, for, each, other, s, work, after, james, had, moved, to, bournemouth, to, help, support, his, invalid, sister, alice, he, took, up, the, invitation, to, pay, daily, visits, to, skerryvore, for, conversation, at, the, stevensons, dinner, table, largely, bedridden, stevenson, described, himself, as, living, like, a, weevil, in, a, biscuit, yet, despite, ill, health, during, his, three, years, in, westbourne, stevenson, wrote, the, bulk, of, his, most, popular, work, treasure, island, kidnapped, strange, case, of, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, which, established, his, wider, reputation, a, child, s, garden, of, verses, and, underwoods, thomas, stevenson, died, in, 1887, leaving, his, 36, year, old, son, feeling, free, to, follow, the, advice, of, his, physician, to, try, a, complete, change, of, climate, stevenson, headed, for, colorado, with, his, widowed, mother, and, family, but, after, landing, in, new, york, they, decided, to, spend, the, winter, in, the, adirondacks, at, a, cure, cottage, now, known, as, stevenson, cottage, at, saranac, lake, new, york, during, the, intensely, cold, winter, stevenson, wrote, some, of, his, best, essays, including, pulvis, et, umbra, he, also, began, the, master, of, ballantrae, and, lightheartedly, planned, a, cruise, to, the, southern, pacific, ocean, for, the, following, summer, whenever, i, read, a, book, or, a, passage, that, particularly, pleased, me, in, which, a, thing, was, said, or, an, effect, rendered, with, propriety, in, which, there, was, either, some, conspicuous, force, or, some, happy, distinction, in, the, style, i, must, sit, down, at, once, and, set, myself, to, ape, that, quality, i, was, unsuccessful, and, i, knew, it, and, tried, again, and, was, again, unsuccessful, and, always, unsuccessful, but, at, least, in, these, vain, bouts, i, got, some, practice, in, rhythm, in, harmony, in, construction, and, the, co, ordination, of, parts, i, have, thus, played, the, sedulous, ape, to, hazlitt, to, lamb, to, wordsworth, to,

in, his, youth, stevenson, s, critical, essays, on, literature, contain, few, sustained, analyses, of, style, or, content, in, a, penny, plain, and, two, pence, coloured, 1884, he, suggests, that, his, own, approach, owed, much, to, the, exaggerated, and, romantic, world, that, as, a, child, he, had, entered, as, proud, owner, of, skelt, s, juvenile, drama, a, toy, set, of, cardboard, characters, who, were, actors, in, melodramatic, dramas, a, gossip, on, romance, 1882, and, a, gossip, on, a, novel, of, dumas, s, 1887, imply, that, it, is, better, to, entertain, than, to, instruct, stevenson, very, much, saw, himself, in, the, mould, of, sir, walter, scott, a, storyteller, with, an, ability, to, transport, his, readers, away, from, themselves, and, their, circumstances, he, took, issue, with, what, he, saw, as, the, tendency, in, french, realism, to, dwell, on, sordidness, and, ugliness, in, the, lantern, bearer, 1888, he, appears, to, take, emile, zola, to, task, for, failing, to, seek, out, nobility, in, his, protagonists, in, a, humble, remonstrance, stevenson, answers, henry, james, s, claim, in, the, art, of, fiction, 1884, that, the, novel, competes, with, life, stevenson, protests, that, no, novel, can, ever, hope, to, match, life, s, complexity, it, merely, abstracts, from, life, to, produce, a, harmonious, pattern, of, its, own, man, s, one, method, whether, he, reasons, or, creates, is, to, half, shut, his, eyes, against, the, dazzle, and, confusion, of, reality, life, is, monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt, and, poignant, a, work, of, art, in, comparison, is, neat, finite, self, contained, rational, flowing, and, emasculate, the, novel, which, is, a, work, of, art, exists, not, by, its, resemblances, to, life, which, are, forced, and, material, but, by, its, immeasurable, difference, from, life, which, is, designed, and, significant, it, is, not, clear, however, that, in, this, there, was, any, real, basis, for, disagreement, with, james, stevenson, had, presented, james, with, a, copy, of, kidnapped, but, it, was, treasure, island, that, james, favoured, written, as, a, story, for, boys, stevenson, had, thought, it, in, no, need, of, psychology, or, fine, writing, but, its, success, is, credited, with, liberating, children, s, writing, from, the, chains, of, victorian, didacticism, during, his, college, years, stevenson, briefly, identified, himself, as, a, red, hot, socialist, but, already, by, age, 26, he, was, writing, of, looking, back, on, this, time, with, something, like, regret, now, i, know, that, in, thus, turning, conservative, with, years, i, am, going, through, the, normal, cycle, of, change, and, travelling, in, the, common, orbit, of, men, s, opinions, his, cousin, and, biographer, sir, graham, balfour, claimed, that, stevenson, probably, throughout, life, would, if, compelled, to, vote, have, always, supported, the, conservative, candidate, in, 1866, then, 15, year, old, stevenson, did, vote, for, benjamin, disraeli, the, tory, democrat, and, future, conservative, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, for, the, lord, rectorship, of, the, university, of, edinburgh, but, this, was, against, a, markedly, illiberal, challenger, the, historian, thomas, carlyle, carlyle, was, notorious, for, his, anti, democratic, and, pro, slavery, views, in, the, day, after, tomorrow, appearing, in, the, contemporary, review, april, 1887, stevenson, suggested, we, are, all, becoming, socialists, without, knowing, it, legislation, grows, authoritative, grows, philanthropical, bristles, with, new, duties, and, new, penalties, and, casts, a, spawn, of, inspectors, who, now, begin, note, book, in, hand, to, darken, the, face, of, england, he, is, referring, to, the, steady, growth, in, social, legislation, in, britain, since, the, first, of, the, conservative, sponsored, factory, acts, which, in, 1833, established, a, professional, factory, inspectorate, stevenson, cautioned, that, this, new, waggon, load, of, laws, points, to, a, future, in, which, our, grandchildren, might, taste, the, pleasures, of, existence, in, something, far, liker, an, ant, heap, that, any, previous, human, polity, yet, in, reproducing, the, essay, his, latter, day, libertarian, admirers, omit, his, express, understanding, for, the, abandonment, of, whiggish, classical, liberal, notions, of, laissez, faire, liberty, stevenson, wrote, has, served, us, a, long, while, but, like, all, other, virtues, she, has, taken, wages, has, dutifully, served, mammon, so, that, many, things, we, were, accustomed, to, admire, as, the, benefits, of, freedom, and, common, to, all, were, truly, benefits, of, wealth, and, took, their, value, from, our, neighbour, s, poverty, freedom, to, be, desirable, involves, kindness, wisdom, and, all, the, virtues, of, the, free, but, the, free, man, as, we, have, seen, him, in, action, has, been, as, of, yore, only, the, master, of, many, helots, and, the, slaves, are, still, ill, fed, ill, clad, ill, taught, ill, housed, insolently, entreated, and, driven, to, their, mines, and, workshops, by, the, lash, of, famine, in, january, 1888, aged, 37, in, response, to, american, press, coverage, of, the, land, war, in, ireland, stevenson, penned, a, political, essay, rejected, by, scribner, s, magazine, and, never, published, in, his, lifetime, that, advanced, a, broadly, conservative, theme, the, necessity, of, staying, internal, violence, by, rigid, law, notwithstanding, his, title, confessions, of, a, unionist, stevenson, defends, neither, the, union, with, britain, she, had, majestically, demonstrated, her, incapacity, to, rule, ireland, nor, landlordism, scarcely, more, defensible, in, ireland, than, as, he, had, witnessed, it, in, the, goldfields, of, california, rather, he, protests, the, readiness, to, pass, lightly, over, crimes, unmanly, murders, and, the, harshest, extremes, of, boycotting, where, these, are, deemed, political, this, he, argues, is, to, defeat, law, which, is, ever, a, compromise, and, to, invite, anarchy, it, is, the, sentimentalist, preparing, the, pathway, for, the, brute, in, june, 1888, stevenson, chartered, the, yacht, casco, and, set, sail, with, his, family, from, san, francisco, the, vessel, plowed, her, path, of, snow, across, the, empty, deep, far, from, all, track, of, commerce, far, from, any, hand, of, help, the, sea, air, and, thrill, of, adventure, for, a, time, restored, his, health, and, for, nearly, three, years, he, wandered, the, eastern, and, central, pacific, stopping, for, extended, stays, at, the, hawaiian, islands, where, he, became, a, good, friend, of, king, kal, kaua, he, befriended, the, king, s, niece, princess, victoria, kaiulani, who, also, had, scottish, heritage, he, spent, time, at, the, gilbert, islands, tahiti, new, zealand, and, the, samoan, islands, during, this, period, he, completed, the, master, of, ballantrae, composed, two, ballads, based, on, the, legends, of, the, islanders, and, wrote, the, bottle, imp, he, preserved, the, experience, of, these, years, in, his, various, letters, and, in, his, in, the, south, seas, which, was, published, posthumously, he, made, a, voyage, in, 1889, with, lloyd, on, the, trading, schooner, equator, visiting, butaritari, mariki, apaiang, and, abemama, in, the, gilbert, islands, they, spent, several, months, on, abemama, with, tyrant, chief, tem, binoka, whom, stevenson, described, in, in, the, south, seas, stevenson, left, sydney, australia, on, the, janet, nicoll, in, april, 1890, for, his, third, and, final, voyage, among, the, south, seas, islands, he, intended, to, produce, another, book, of, travel, writing, to, follow, his, earlier, book, in, the, south, seas, but, it, was, his, wife, who, eventually, published, her, journal, of, their, third, voyage, fanny, misnames, the, ship, in, her, account, the, cruise, of, the, janet, nichol, a, fellow, passenger, was, jack, buckland, whose, stories, of, life, as, an, island, trader, became, the, inspiration, for, the, character, of, tommy, hadden, in, the, wrecker, 1892, which, stevenson, and, lloyd, osbourne, wrote, together, buckland, visited, the, stevensons, at, vailima, in, 1894, in, december, 1889, 39, year, old, stevenson, and, his, extended, family, arrived, at, the, port, of, apia, in, the, samoan, islands, and, there, he, and, fanny, decided, to, settle, in, january, 1890, they, purchased, 314, 1, 4, acres, 127, 2, ha, at, vailima, some, miles, inland, from, apia, the, capital, on, which, they, built, the, islands, first, two, storey, house, fanny, s, sister, nellie, van, de, grift, sanchez, wrote, that, it, was, in, samoa, that, the, word, home, first, began, to, have, a, real, meaning, for, these, gypsy, wanderers, in, may, 1891, they, were, joined, by, stevenson, s, mother, margaret, while, his, wife, set, about, managing, and, working, the, estate, 40, year, old, stevenson, took, the, native, name, tusitala, samoan, for, teller, of, tales, and, began, collecting, local, stories, often, he, would, exchange, these, for, his, own, tales, the, first, work, of, literature, in, samoan, was, his, translation, of, the, bottle, imp, 1891, which, presents, a, pacific, wide, community, as, the, setting, for, a, moral, fable, immersing, himself, in, the, islands, culture, occasioned, a, political, awakening, it, placed, stevenson, at, an, angle, to, the, rival, great, powers, britain, germany, and, the, united, states, whose, warships, were, common, sights, in, samoan, harbours, he, understood, that, as, in, the, scottish, highlands, comparisons, with, his, homeland, came, readily, an, indigenous, clan, society, was, unprepared, for, the, arrival, of, foreigners, who, played, upon, its, existing, rivalries, and, divisions, as, the, external, pressures, upon, samoan, society, grew, tensions, soon, descended, into, several, inter, clan, wars, no, longer, content, to, be, a, romancer, stevenson, became, a, reporter, and, an, agitator, firing, off, letters, to, the, times, which, rehearsed, with, an, ironic, twist, that, surely, owed, something, to, his, edinburgh, legal, training, a, tale, of, european, and, american, misconduct, his, concern, for, the, polynesians, is, also, found, in, the, south, sea, letters, published, in, magazines, in, 1891, and, then, in, book, form, as, in, the, south, seas, in, 1896, in, an, effort, he, feared, might, result, in, his, own, deportation, stevenson, helped, secure, the, recall, of, two, european, officials, a, footnote, to, history, eight, years, of, trouble, in, samoa, 1892, was, a, detailed, chronicle, of, the, intersection, of, rivalries, between, the, great, powers, and, the, first, samoan, civil, war, as, much, as, he, said, he, disdained, politics, i, used, to, think, meanly, of, the, plumber, he, wrote, to, his, friend, sidney, colvin, but, how, he, shines, beside, the, politician, stevenson, felt, himself, obliged, to, take, sides, he, openly, allied, himself, with, chief, mataafa, whose, rival, malietoa, was, backed, by, the, germans, whose, firms, were, beginning, to, monopolise, copra, and, cocoa, bean, processing, stevenson, was, alarmed, above, all, by, what, he, perceived, as, the, samoans, economic, innocence, their, failure, to, secure, their, claim, to, proprietorship, of, the, land, in, a, lockean, sense, through, improving, management, and, labour, in, 1894, just, months, before, his, death, he, addressed, the, island, chiefs, there, is, but, one, way, to, defend, samoa, hear, it, before, it, is, too, late, it, is, to, make, roads, and, gardens, and, care, for, your, trees, and, sell, their, produce, wisely, and, in, one, word, to, occupy, and, use, your, country, if, you, do, not, occupy, and, use, your, country, others, will, it, will, not, continue, to, be, yours, or, your, children, s, if, you, occupy, it, for, nothing, you, and, your, children, will, in, that, case, be, cast, out, into, outer, darkness, he, had, seen, these, judgments, of, god, not, only, in, hawaii, where, abandoned, native, churches, stood, like, tombstones, over, a, grave, in, the, midst, of, the, white, men, s, sugar, fields, but, also, in, ireland, and, in, the, mountains, of, my, own, country, scotland, these, were, a, fine, people, in, the, past, brave, gay, faithful, and, very, much, like, samoans, except, in, one, particular, that, they, were, much, wiser, and, better, at, that, business, of, fighting, of, which, you, think, so, much, but, the, time, came, to, them, as, it, now, comes, to, you, and, it, did, not, find, them, ready, five, years, after, stevenson, s, death, the, samoan, islands, were, partitioned, between, germany, and, the, united, states, stevenson, wrote, an, estimated, 700, 000, words, during, his, years, on, samoa, he, completed, the, beach, of, fales, the, first, person, tale, of, a, scottish, copra, trader, on, a, south, sea, island, a, man, unheroic, in, his, actions, or, his, own, soul, rather, he, is, a, man, of, limited, understanding, and, imagination, comfortable, with, his, own, prejudices, where, he, wonders, can, he, find, whites, for, his, half, caste, daughters, the, villains, are, white, their, behaviour, towards, the, islanders, ruthlessly, duplicitous, stevenson, saw, the, beach, of, fales, as, the, ground, breaking, work, in, his, turn, away, from, romance, to, realism, stevenson, wrote, to, his, friend, sidney, colvin, it, is, the, first, realistic, south, seas, story, i, mean, with, real, south, sea, character, and, details, of, life, everybody, else, that, has, tried, that, i, have, seen, got, carried, away, by, the, romance, and, ended, in, a, kind, of, sugar, candy, sham, epic, and, the, whole, effect, was, lost, now, i, have, got, the, smell, and, look, of, the, thing, a, good, deal, you, will, know, more, about, the, south, seas, after, you, have, read, my,

presenting, a, microcosm, of, imperialist, society, directed, by, greedy, but, incompetent, whites, the, labour, supplied, by, long, suffering, natives, who, fulfil, their, duties, without, orders, and, are, true, to, the, missionary, faith, which, the, europeans, make, no, pretence, of, respecting, it, confirmed, the, new, realistic, turn, in, stevenson, s, writing, away, from, romance, and,

earlier, form, stevenson, also, wrote, catriona, 1893, a, sequel, to, his, earlier, novel, kidnapped, 1886, continuing, the, adventures, of, its, hero, david, balfour, although, he, felt, as, a, writer, that, there, was, never, any, man, had, so, many, irons, in, the, fire, by, the, end, of, 1893, stevenson, feared, that, he, had, overworked, and, exhausted, his, creative, vein, his, writing, was, partly, driven, by, the, need, to, meet, the, expenses, of, vailima, but, in, a, last, burst, of, energy, he, began, work, on, weir, of, hermiston, it, s, so, good, that, it, frightens, me, he, is, reported, to, have, exclaimed, he, felt, that, this, was, the, best, work, he, had, done, set, in, eighteenth, century, scotland, it, is, a, story, of, a, society, that, however, different, like, samoa, is, witnessing, a, breakdown, of, social, rules, and, structures, leading, to, growing, moral, ambivalence, on, 3, december, 1894, stevenson, was, talking, to, his, wife, and, straining, to, open, a, bottle, of, wine, when, he, suddenly, exclaimed, what, s, that, then, asked, his, wife, does, my, face, look, strange, and, collapsed, some, sources, have, stated, that, he, was, instead, attempting, to, make, mayonnaise, when, he, collapsed, he, died, within, a, few, hours, at, the, age, of, 44, due, to, a, stroke, the, samoans, insisted, on, surrounding, his, body, with, a, watch, guard, during, the, night, and, on, bearing, him, on, their, shoulders, to, nearby, mount, vaea, where, they, buried, him, on, a, spot, overlooking, the, sea, on, land, donated, by, british, acting,

during, world, war, i, and, many, stevenson, documents, were, auctioned, off, in, 1918, stevenson, was, a, celebrity, in, his, own, time, being, admired, by, many, other, writers, including, marcel,

chesterton, who, said, that, stevenson, seemed, to, pick, the, right, word, up, on, the, point, of, his, pen, like, a, man, playing, spillikins, stevenson, was, seen, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, as, a, second, class, writer, he, became, relegated, to, children, s, literature, and, horror, genres, condemned, by, literary, figures, such, as, virginia, woolf, daughter, of, his, early, mentor, leslie, stephen, and, her, husband, leonard, woolf, and, he, was, gradually, excluded, from, the, canon, of, literature, taught, in, schools, his, exclusion, reached, its, nadir, in, the, 1973, 2, 000, page, oxford, anthology, of, english, literature, where, he, was, entirely, unmentioned, and, the, norton, anthology, of, english, literature, excluded, him, from, 1968, to, 2000, 1st,

theorist, an, essayist, and, social, critic, a, witness, to, the, colonial, history, of, the, pacific, islands, and, a, humanist, he, was, praised, by, roger, lancelyn, green, one, of, the, oxford, inklings, as, a, writer, of, a, consistently, high, level, of, literary, skill, or, sheer, imaginative, power, and, a, pioneer, of, the, age, of, the, story, tellers, along, with, h, rider, haggard, he, is, now, evaluated, as, a, peer, of, authors, such, as, joseph, conrad, whom, stevenson, influenced, with, his, south, seas, fiction, and, henry, james, with, new, scholarly, studies, and, organisations, devoted, to, him, throughout, the, vicissitudes, of, his, scholarly, reception, stevenson, has, remained, popular, worldwide, according, to, the, index, translationum, stevenson, is,
