georges, henri, joseph, douard, lema, tre, l, m, t, r, l, met, r, french, 17, july, 1894, 20, june, 1966, was, a, belgian, catholic, priest, theoretical, physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and, professor, of, physics, at, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, he, was, the, first, to, theorize, that, the, recession, of, nearby, galaxies, can, be, explained, by, an, expanding, universe, which, was, observationally, confirmed, soon, afterwards, by, edwin, hubble, he, first, derived, hubble, s, law, now, called, the, hubble, lema, tre, law, by, the, iau, and, published, the, first, estimation, of, the, hubble, constant, in, 1927, two, years, before, hubble, s, article, lema, tre, also, proposed, the, big, bang, theory, of, the, origin, of, the, universe, calling, it, the, hypothesis, of, the, primeval, atom, and, later, calling, it, the, beginning, of, the, world, lema, tre, was, born, in, charleroi, belgium, the, eldest, of, four, children, his, father, joseph, lema, tre, was, a, prosperous, industrial, weaver, and, his, mother, was, marguerite, n, e, lannoy, after, a, classical, education, at, a, jesuit, secondary, school, the, coll, ge, du, sacr, c, ur, in, charleroi, in, belgium, he, began, studying, civil, engineering, at, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, at, the, age, of, 17, in, 1914, he, interrupted, his, studies, to, serve, as, an, artillery, officer, in, the, belgian, army, for, the, duration, of, world, war, i, at, the, end, of, hostilities, he, received, the, belgian, war, cross, with, palms, after, the, war, he, studied, physics, and, mathematics, and, began, to, prepare, for, the, diocesan, priesthood, not, for, the, jesuits, he, obtained, his, doctorate, in, 1920, with, a, thesis, entitled, l, approximation, des, fonctions, de, plusieurs, variables, r, elles, approximation, of, functions, of, several, real, variables, written, under, the, direction, of, charles, de, la, vall, e, poussin, he, was, ordained, as, a, priest, on, 22, september, 1923, by, cardinal, d, sir, joseph, mercier, in, 1923, he, became, a, research, associate, in, astronomy, at, the, university, of, cambridge, spending, a, year, at, st, edmund, s, house, now, st, edmund, s, college, university, of, cambridge, there, he, worked, with, arthur, eddington, a, quaker, and, physicist, who, introduced, him, to, modern, cosmology, stellar, astronomy, and, numerical, analysis, he, spent, the, next, year, at, harvard, college, observatory, in, cambridge, massachusetts, with, harlow, shapley, who, had, just, gained, renown, for, his, work, on, nebulae, and, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, where, he, registered, for, the, doctoral, program, in, the, sciences, on, his, return, to, belgium, in, 1925, he, became, a, part, time, lecturer, at, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, and, began, the, report, that, was, published, in, 1927, in, the, annales, de, la, soci, t, scientifique, de, bruxelles, annals, of, the, scientific, society, of, brussels, under, the, title, un, univers, homog, ne, de, masse, constante, et, de, rayon, croissant, rendant, compte, de, la, vitesse, radiale, des, n, buleuses, extragalactiques, a, homogeneous, universe, of, constant, mass, and, growing, radius, accounting, for, the, radial, velocity, of, extragalactic, nebulae, that, was, later, to, bring, him, international, fame, in, this, report, he, presented, the, new, idea, that, the, universe, is, expanding, which, he, derived, from, general, relativity, this, idea, later, became, known, as, hubble, s, law, even, though, lema, tre, was, the, first, to, provide, an, observational, estimate, of, the, hubble, constant, the, initial, state, he, proposed, was, taken, to, be, einstein, s, own, model, of, a, finitely, sized, static, universe, the, paper, had, little, impact, because, the, journal, in, which, it, was, published, was, not, widely, read, by, astronomers, outside, belgium, arthur, eddington, reportedly, helped, translate, the, article, into, english, in, 1931, but, the, part, of, it, pertaining, to, the, estimation, of, the, hubble, constant, was, not, included, in, the, translation, for, reasons, that, remained, unknown, for, a, long, time, this, issue, was, clarified, in, 2011, by, mario, livio, lema, tre, omitted, those, paragraphs, himself, when, translating, the, paper, for, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, favour, of, reports, of, newer, work, on, the, subject, since, by, that, time, hubble, s, calculations, had, already, improved, on, lema, tre, s, earlier, ones, at, this, time, einstein, while, not, taking, exception, to, the, mathematics, of, lema, tre, s, theory, refused, to, accept, that, the, universe, was, expanding, lema, tre, recalled, his, commenting, vos, calculs, sont, corrects, mais, votre, physique, est, abominable, your, calculations, are, correct, but, your, physics, is, atrocious, in, the, same, year, lema, tre, returned, to, mit, to, present, his, doctoral, thesis, on, the, gravitational, field, in, a, fluid, sphere, of, uniform, invariant, density, according, to, the, theory, of, relativity, upon, obtaining, his, ph, d, he, was, named, ordinary, professor, at, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, in, 1931, arthur, eddington, published, in, the, monthly, notices, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, a, long, commentary, on, lema, tre, s, 1927, article, which, eddington, described, as, a, brilliant, solution, to, the, outstanding, problems, of, cosmology, the, original, paper, was, published, in, an, abbreviated, english, translation, later, on, in, 1931, along, with, a, sequel, by, lema, tre, responding, to, eddington, s, comments, lema, tre, was, then, invited, to, london, to, participate, in, a, meeting, of, the, british, association, on, the, relation, between, the, physical, universe, and, spirituality, there, he, proposed, that, the, universe, expanded, from, an, initial, point, which, he, called, the, primeval, atom, he, developed, this, idea, in, a, report, published, in, nature, lema, tre, s, theory, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, an, article, for, the, general, reader, on, science, and, technology, subjects, in, the, december, 1932, issue, of, popular, science, lema, tre, s, theory, became, better, known, as, the, big, bang, theory, a, picturesque, term, playfully, coined, during, a, 1949, bbc, radio, broadcast, by, the, astronomer, fred, hoyle, who, was, a, proponent, of, the, steady, state, universe, and, remained, so, until, his, death, in, 2001, lema, tre, s, proposal, met, with, skepticism, from, his, fellow, scientists, eddington, found, lema, tre, s, notion, unpleasant, einstein, thought, it, unjustifiable, from, a, physical, point, of, view, although, he, encouraged, lema, tre, to, look, into, the, possibility, of, models, of, non, isotropic, expansion, so, it, is, clear, he, was, not, altogether, dismissive, of, the, concept, einstein, also, appreciated, lema, tre, s, argument, that, einstein, s, model, of, a, static, universe, could, not, be, sustained, into, the, infinite, past, with, manuel, sandoval, vallarta, lema, tre, discovered, that, the, intensity, of, cosmic, rays, varied, with, latitude, because, these, charged, particles, are, interacting, with, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, in, their, calculations, lema, tre, and, vallarta, made, use, of, mit, s, differential, analyzer, computer, developed, by, vannevar, bush, they, also, worked, on, a, theory, of, primary, cosmic, radiation, and, applied, it, to, their, investigations, of, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, and, the, effects, of, the, galaxy, s, rotation, lema, tre, and, einstein, met, on, four, occasions, in, 1927, in, brussels, at, the, time, of, a, solvay, conference, in, 1932, in, belgium, at, the, time, of, a, cycle, of, conferences, in, brussels, in, california, in, january, 1933, and, in, 1935, at, princeton, in, 1933, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, after, lema, tre, detailed, his, theory, einstein, stood, up, applauded, and, is, supposed, to, have, said, this, is, the, most, beautiful, and, satisfactory, explanation, of, creation, to, which, i, have, ever, listened, however, there, is, disagreement, over, the, reporting, of, this, quote, in, the, newspapers, of, the, time, and, it, may, be, that, einstein, was, not, referring, to, the, theory, as, a, whole, but, only, to, lema, tre, s, proposal, that, cosmic, rays, may, be, the, leftover, artifacts, of, the, initial, explosion, in, 1933, when, he, resumed, his, theory, of, the, expanding, universe, and, published, a, more, detailed, version, in, the, annals, of, the, scientific, society, of, brussels, lema, tre, achieved, his, greatest, public, recognition, newspapers, around, the, world, called, him, a, famous, belgian, scientist, and, described, him, as, the, leader, of, new, cosmological, physics, also, in, 1933, lema, tre, served, as, a, visiting, professor, at, the, catholic, university, of, america, on, july, 27, 1935, he, was, named, an, honorary, canon, of, the, malines, cathedral, by, cardinal, josef, van, roey, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, pontifical, academy, of, sciences, in, 1936, and, took, an, active, role, there, serving, as, its, president, from, march, 1960, until, his, death, in, 1941, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, and, arts, of, belgium, in, 1946, he, published, his, book, on, l, hypoth, se, de, l, atome, primitif, the, primeval, atom, hypothesis, it, was, translated, into, spanish, in, the, same, year, and, into, english, in, 1950, in, relation, to, catholic, teaching, on, the, origin, of, the, universe, lema, tre, viewed, his, theory, as, neutral, with, neither, a, connection, nor, a, contradiction, of, the, faith, as, a, devoted, catholic, priest, lema, tre, was, opposed, to, mixing, science, with, religion, although, he, held, that, the, two, fields, were, not, in, conflict, during, the, 1950s, he, gradually, gave, up, part, of, his, teaching, workload, ending, it, completely, when, he, took, emeritus, status, in, 1964, in, 1962, strongly, opposed, to, the, expulsion, of, french, speakers, from, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, he, created, the, acapsul, movement, together, with, g, rard, garitte, to, fight, against, the, split, during, the, second, vatican, council, of, 1962, 65, he, was, asked, by, pope, john, xxiii, to, serve, on, the, 4th, session, of, the, pontifical, commission, on, birth, control, however, since, his, health, made, it, impossible, for, him, to, travel, to, rome, he, suffered, a, heart, attack, in, december, 1964, lema, tre, demurred, expressing, surprise, that, he, was, chosen, he, told, a, dominican, colleague, p, re, henri, de, riedmatten, that, he, thought, it, was, dangerous, for, a, mathematician, to, venture, outside, of, his, area, of, expertise, he, was, also, named, domestic, prelate, monsignor, in, 1960, by, pope, john, xxiii, at, the, end, of, his, life, he, was, increasingly, devoted, to, problems, of, numerical, calculation, he, was, a, remarkable, algebraicist, and, arithmetical, calculator, since, 1930, he, had, used, the, most, powerful, calculating, machine, of, the, time, the, mercedes, euklid, in, 1958, he, was, introduced, to, the, university, s, burroughs, e, 101, its, first, electronic, computer, lema, tre, maintained, a, strong, interest, in, the, development, of, computers, and, even, more, in, the, problems, of, language, and, computer, programming, he, died, on, 20, june, 1966, shortly, after, having, learned, of, the, discovery, of, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, which, provided, further, evidence, for, his, proposal, about, the, birth, of, the, universe, lema, tre, was, a, pioneer, in, applying, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, to, cosmology, in, a, 1927, article, which, preceded, edwin, hubble, s, landmark, article, by, two, years, lema, tre, derived, what, became, known, as, hubble, s, law, and, proposed, it, as, a, generic, phenomenon, in, relativistic, cosmology, lema, tre, was, also, the, first, to, estimate, the, numerical, value, of, the, hubble, constant, einstein, was, skeptical, of, this, paper, when, lema, tre, approached, einstein, at, the, 1927, solvay, conference, the, latter, pointed, out, that, alexander, friedmann, had, proposed, a, similar, solution, to, einstein, s, equations, in, 1922, implying, that, the, radius, of, the, universe, increased, over, time, einstein, had, also, criticized, friedmann, s, calculations, but, withdrew, his, comments, friedmann, died, in, 1925, soon, after, inventing, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, in, 1931, his, annus, mirabilis, lema, tre, published, an, article, in, nature, setting, out, his, theory, of, the, primeval, atom, because, lema, tre, spent, almost, his, entire, career, in, europe, his, scientific, work, was, not, as, well, known, in, the, united, states, as, that, of, hubble, or, einstein, both, well, known, in, the, u, s, by, virtue, of, residing, there, nevertheless, lema, tre, s, theory, changed, the, course, of, cosmology, this, was, because, lema, tre, both, friedmann, and, lema, tre, proposed, relativistic, cosmologies, featuring, an, expanding, universe, however, lema, tre, was, the, first, to, propose, that, the, expansion, explains, the, redshift, of, galaxies, he, further, concluded, that, an, initial, creation, like, event, must, have, occurred, in, the, 1980s, alan, guth, and, andrei, linde, modified, this, theory, by, adding, to, it, a, period, of, inflation, einstein, at, first, dismissed, friedmann, and, then, privately, lema, tre, out, of, hand, saying, that, not, all, mathematics, lead, to, correct, theories, after, hubble, s, discovery, was, published, einstein, quickly, and, publicly, endorsed, lema, tre, s, theory, helping, both, the, theory, and, its, proposer, get, fast, recognition, lema, tre, was, also, an, early, adopter, of, computers, for, cosmological, calculations, he, introduced, the, first, computer, to, his, university, a, burroughs, e, 101, in, 1958, and, was, one, of, the, inventors, of, the, fast, fourier, transform, algorithm, in, 1931, lema, tre, was, the, first, scientist, to, propose, the, expansion, of, the, universe, was, actually, accelerating, which, was, confirmed, observationally, in, the, 1990s, through, observations, of, very, distant, type, ia, supernova, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, which, led, to, the, 2011, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1933, lema, tre, found, an, important, inhomogeneous, solution, of, einstein, s, field, equations, describing, a, spherical, dust, cloud, the, lema, tre, tolman, metric, in, 1948, lema, tre, published, a, polished, mathematical, essay, quaternions, et, espace, elliptique, which, clarified, an, obscure, space, william, kingdon, clifford, had, cryptically, described, elliptic, space, in, 1873, at, a, time, when, versors, were, too, common, to, mention, lema, tre, developed, the, theory, of, quaternions, from, first, principles, so, that, his, essay, can, stand, on, its, own, but, he, recalled, the, erlangen, program, in, geometry, while, developing, the, metric, geometry, of, elliptic, space, in, 1954, lema, tre, was, the, first, theoretical, cosmologist, ever, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, prediction, of, the, expanding, universe, he, was, also, nominated, for, the, 1956, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, primeval, atom, theory, on, 17, march, 1934, lema, tre, received, the, francqui, prize, the, highest, belgian, scientific, distinction, from, king, leopold, iii, his, proposers, were, albert, einstein, charles, de, la, vall, e, poussin, and, alexandre, de, hemptinne, the, members, of, the, international, jury, were, eddington, langevin, th, ophile, de, donder, and, marcel, dehalu, the, same, year, he, received, the, mendel, medal, of, the, villanova, university, in, 1936, lema, tre, received, the, prix, jules, janssen, the, highest, award, of, the, soci, t, astronomique, de, france, the, french, astronomical, society, another, distinction, that, the, belgian, government, reserves, for, exceptional, scientists, was, allotted, to, him, in, 1950, the, decennial, prize, for, applied, sciences, for, the, period, 1933, 1942, lema, tre, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1945, in, 1953, he, was, given, the, inaugural, eddington, medal, awarded, by, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, 2005, lema, tre, was, voted, to, the, 61st, place, of, de, grootste, belg, the, greatest, belgian, a, flemish, television, program, on, the, vrt, in, the, same, year, he, was, voted, to, the, 78th, place, by, the, audience, of, the, les, plus, grands, belges, the, greatest, belgians, a, television, show, of, the, rtbf, later, in, december, 2022, vrt, recovered, in, its, archives, a, lost, 20, minute, interview, with, georges, lema, tre, in, 1964, a, gem, says, cosmologist, thomas, hertog, on, 17, july, 2018, google, doodle, celebrated, georges, lema, tre, s, 124th, birthday, on, 26, october, 2018, an, electronic, vote, among, all, members, of, the, international, astronomical, union, voted, 78, to, recommend, changing, the, name, of, the, hubble, law, to, the, hubble, lema, tre, law
