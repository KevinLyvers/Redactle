du, fu, chinese, wade, giles, tu, fu, 712, 770, was, a, chinese, poet, and, politician, during, the, tang, dynasty, together, with, his, elder, contemporary, and, friend, li, bai, du, is, often, considered, one, of, the, greatest, chinese, poets, his, greatest, ambition, was, to, serve, his, country, as, a, successful, civil, servant, but, du, proved, unable, to, make, the, necessary, accommodations, his, life, like, all, of, china, was, devastated, by, the, an, lushan, rebellion, of, 755, and, his, last, 15, years, were, a, time, of, almost, constant, unrest, although, initially, he, was, little, known, to, other, writers, his, works, came, to, be, hugely, influential, in, both, chinese, and, japanese, literary, culture, of, his, poetic, writing, nearly, fifteen, hundred, poems, have, been, preserved, over, the, ages, he, has, been, called, the, poet, historian, and, the, poet, sage, by, chinese, critics, while, the, range, of, his, work, has, allowed, him, to, be, introduced, to, western, readers, as, the, chinese, virgil, horace, ovid, shakespeare, milton, burns, wordsworth, b, ranger, hugo, or, baudelaire, traditional, chinese, literary, criticism, emphasised, the, life, of, the, author, when, interpreting, a, work, a, practice, which, the, american, scholar, burton, watson, attributed, to, the, close, links, that, traditional, chinese, thought, posits, between, art, and, morality, since, many, of, du, fu, s, poems, feature, morality, and, history, this, practice, is, particularly, important, another, reason, identified, by, the, chinese, historian, william, hung, is, that, chinese, poems, are, typically, concise, omitting, context, that, might, be, relevant, but, which, an, informed, contemporary, could, be, assumed, to, know, for, modern, western, readers, the, less, accurately, we, know, the, time, the, place, and, the, circumstances, in, the, background, the, more, liable, we, are, to, imagine, it, incorrectly, and, the, result, will, be, that, we, either, misunderstand, the, poem, or, fail, to, understand, it, altogether, stephen, owen, suggests, a, third, factor, particular, to, du, fu, arguing, that, the, variety, of, the, poet, s, work, required, consideration, of, his, whole, life, rather, than, the, reductive, categorisations, used, for, more, limited, poets, most, of, what, is, known, of, du, fu, s, life, comes, from, his, poems, his, paternal, grandfather, was, du, shenyan, a, noted, politician, and, poet, during, the, reign, of, empress, wu, zetian, r, 690, 705, du, fu, was, born, in, 712, the, exact, birthplace, is, unknown, except, that, it, was, near, luoyang, henan, province, gong, county, is, a, favourite, candidate, in, later, life, he, considered, himself, to, belong, to, the, capital, city, of, chang, an, ancestral, hometown, of, the, du, family, du, fu, s, mother, died, shortly, after, he, was, born, and, he, was, partially, raised, by, his, aunt, he, had, an, elder, brother, who, died, young, he, also, had, three, half, brothers, and, one, half, sister, to, whom, he, frequently, refers, in, his, poems, although, he, never, mentions, his, stepmother, the, son, of, a, minor, scholar, official, his, youth, was, spent, on, the, standard, education, of, a, future, civil, servant, study, and, memorisation, of, the, confucian, classics, of, philosophy, history, and, poetry, he, later, claimed, to, have, produced, creditable, poems, by, his, early, teens, but, these, have, been, lost, in, the, early, 730s, he, travelled, in, the, jiangsu, and, zhejiang, area, his, earliest, surviving, poem, describing, a, poetry, contest, is, thought, to, date, from, the, end, of, this, period, around, 735, in, that, year, he, took, the, imperial, examination, likely, in, chang, an, he, failed, to, his, surprise, and, that, of, centuries, of, later, critics, hung, concludes, that, he, probably, failed, because, his, prose, style, at, the, time, was, too, dense, and, obscure, while, chou, suggests, his, failure, to, cultivate, connections, in, the, capital, may, have, been, to, blame, after, this, failure, he, went, back, to, travelling, this, time, around, shandong, and, hebei, his, father, died, around, 740, du, fu, would, have, been, allowed, to, enter, the, civil, service, because, of, his, father, s, rank, but, he, is, thought, to, have, given, up, the, privilege, in, favour, of, one, of, his, half, brothers, he, spent, the, next, four, years, living, in, the, luoyang, area, fulfilling, his, duties, in, domestic, affairs, in, the, autumn, of, 744, he, met, li, bai, li, po, for, the, first, time, and, the, two, poets, formed, a, friendship, david, young, describes, this, as, the, most, significant, formative, element, in, du, fu, s, artistic, development, because, it, gave, him, a, living, example, of, the, reclusive, poet, scholar, life, to, which, he, was, attracted, after, his, failure, in, the, civil, service, exam, the, relationship, was, somewhat, one, sided, however, du, fu, was, by, some, years, the, younger, while, li, bai, was, already, a, poetic, star, we, have, twelve, poems, to, or, about, li, bai, from, the, younger, poet, but, only, one, in, the, other, direction, they, met, again, only, once, in, 745, in, 746, he, moved, to, the, capital, in, an, attempt, to, resurrect, his, official, career, he, took, the, civil, service, exam, a, second, time, during, the, following, year, but, all, the, candidates, were, failed, by, the, prime, minister, apparently, in, order, to, prevent, the, emergence, of, possible, rivals, he, never, again, attempted, the, examinations, instead, petitioning, the, emperor, directly, in, 751, 754, and, probably, again, in, 755, he, married, around, 752, and, by, 757, the, couple, had, had, five, children, three, sons, and, two, daughters, but, one, of, the, sons, died, in, infancy, in, 755, from, 754, he, began, to, have, lung, problems, probably, asthma, the, first, of, a, series, of, ailments, which, dogged, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, it, was, in, that, year, that, du, fu, was, forced, to, move, his, family, due, to, the, turmoil, of, a, famine, brought, about, by, massive, floods, in, the, region, in, 755, he, received, an, appointment, as, registrar, of, the, right, commandant, s, office, of, the, crown, prince, s, palace, although, this, was, a, minor, post, in, normal, times, it, would, have, been, at, least, the, start, of, an, official, career, even, before, he, had, begun, work, however, the, position, was, swept, away, by, events, the, an, lushan, rebellion, began, in, december, 755, and, was, not, completely, suppressed, for, almost, eight, years, it, caused, enormous, disruption, to, chinese, society, the, census, of, 754, recorded, 52, 9, million, people, but, ten, years, later, the, census, counted, just, 16, 9, million, the, remainder, having, been, displaced, or, killed, during, this, time, du, fu, led, a, largely, itinerant, life, unsettled, by, wars, associated, famines, and, imperial, displeasure, this, period, of, unhappiness, was, the, making, of, du, fu, as, a, poet, eva, shan, chou, has, written, that, what, he, saw, around, him, the, lives, of, his, family, neighbors, and, strangers, what, he, heard, and, what, he, hoped, for, or, feared, from, the, progress, of, various, campaigns, these, became, the, enduring, themes, of, his, poetry, even, when, he, learned, of, the, death, of, his, youngest, child, he, turned, to, the, suffering, of, others, in, his, poetry, instead, of, dwelling, upon, his, own, misfortunes, du, fu, wrote, brooding, on, what, i, have, lived, through, if, even, i, know, such, suffering, the, common, man, must, surely, be, rattled, by, the, winds, in, 756, emperor, xuanzong, was, forced, to, flee, the, capital, and, abdicate, du, fu, who, had, been, away, from, the, city, took, his, family, to, a, place, of, safety, and, attempted, to, join, the, court, of, the, new, emperor, suzong, but, he, was, captured, by, the, rebels, and, taken, to, chang, an, in, the, autumn, his, youngest, son, du, zongwu, baby, bear, was, born, around, this, time, du, fu, is, thought, to, have, contracted, malaria, he, escaped, from, chang, an, the, following, year, and, was, appointed, reminder, when, he, rejoined, the, court, in, may, 757, this, post, gave, access, to, the, emperor, but, was, largely, ceremonial, du, fu, s, conscientiousness, compelled, him, to, try, to, make, use, of, it, he, caused, trouble, for, himself, by, protesting, the, removal, of, his, friend, and, patron, fang, guan, on, a, petty, charge, he, was, arrested, but, was, pardoned, in, june, he, was, granted, leave, to, visit, his, family, in, september, but, he, soon, rejoined, the, court, and, on, 8, december, 757, he, returned, to, chang, an, with, the, emperor, following, its, recapture, by, government, forces, however, his, advice, continued, to, be, unappreciated, and, in, the, summer, of, 758, he, was, demoted, to, a, post, as, commissioner, of, education, in, huazhou, the, position, was, not, to, his, taste, in, one, poem, he, wrote, i, am, about, to, scream, madly, in, the, office, especially, when, they, bring, more, papers, to, pile, higher, on, my, desk, from, early, autumn, miserable, heat, papers, piling, up, z, oqi, k, r, du, n, xi, ngr, ng, william, hung, translation, he, moved, on, in, the, summer, of, 759, this, has, traditionally, been, ascribed, to, famine, but, hung, believes, that, frustration, is, a, more, likely, reason, he, next, spent, around, six, weeks, in, qinzhou, now, tianshui, gansu, province, where, he, wrote, more, than, sixty, poems, in, december, 759, he, briefly, stayed, in, tonggu, modern, gansu, he, departed, on, 24, december, for, chengdu, sichuan, province, where, he, was, hosted, by, local, prefect, and, fellow, poet, pei, di, du, subsequently, based, himself, in, sichuan, for, most, of, the, next, five, years, by, the, autumn, of, that, year, he, was, in, financial, trouble, and, sent, poems, begging, help, to, various, acquaintances, he, was, relieved, by, yan, wu, a, friend, and, former, colleague, who, was, appointed, governor, general, at, chengdu, despite, his, financial, problems, this, was, one, of, the, happiest, and, most, peaceful, periods, of, his, life, many, of, du, s, poems, from, this, period, are, peaceful, depictions, of, his, life, at, du, fu, thatched, cottage, in, 762, he, left, the, city, to, escape, a, rebellion, but, he, returned, in, summer, 764, when, he, was, appointed, an, advisor, to, yan, who, was, involved, in, campaigns, against, the, tibetan, empire, luoyang, the, region, of, his, birthplace, was, recovered, by, government, forces, in, the, winter, of, 762, and, in, the, spring, of, 765, du, fu, and, his, family, sailed, down, the, yangtze, apparently, with, the, intention, of, making, their, way, there, they, travelled, slowly, held, up, by, his, ill, health, by, this, time, he, was, suffering, from, poor, eyesight, deafness, and, general, old, age, in, addition, to, his, previous, ailments, they, stayed, in, kuizhou, in, what, is, now, baidicheng, chongqing, at, the, entrance, to, the, three, gorges, for, almost, two, years, from, late, spring, 766, this, period, was, du, fu, s, last, great, poetic, flowering, and, here, he, wrote, 400, poems, in, his, dense, late, style, in, autumn, 766, bo, maolin, became, governor, of, the, region, he, supported, du, fu, financially, and, employed, him, as, his, unofficial, secretary, in, march, 768, he, resumed, his, journey, and, got, as, far, as, hunan, province, where, he, died, in, tanzhou, now, changsha, in, november, or, december, 770, in, his, 58th, year, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, and, two, sons, who, remained, in, the, area, for, some, years, at, least, his, last, known, descendant, is, a, grandson, who, requested, a, grave, inscription, for, the, poet, from, yuan, zhen, in, 813, hung, summarises, his, life, by, concluding, that, he, appeared, to, be, a, filial, son, an, affectionate, father, a, generous, brother, a, faithful, husband, a, loyal, friend, a, dutiful, official, and, a, patriotic, subject, below, is, an, example, of, one, of, du, fu, s, later, works, like, many, other, poems, in, the, tang, it, featured, the, theme, of, a, long, parting, between, friends, which, was, often, due, to, officials, being, frequently, transferred, to, the, provinces, it, is, almost, as, hard, for, friends, to, meet, as, for, the, orion, and, scorpius, tonight, then, is, a, rare, event, joining, in, the, candlelight, two, men, who, were, young, not, long, ago, but, now, are, turning, grey, at, the, temples, to, find, that, half, our, friends, are, dead, shocks, us, burns, our, hearts, with, grief, we, little, guessed, it, would, be, twenty, years, before, i, could, visit, you, again, when, i, went, away, you, were, still, unmarried, but, now, these, boys, and, girls, in, a, row, are, very, kind, to, their, father, s, old, friend, they, ask, me, where, i, have, been, on, my, journey, and, then, when, we, have, talked, awhile, they, bring, and, show, me, wines, and, dishes, spring, chives, cut, in, the, night, rain, and, brown, rice, cooked, freshly, a, special, way, my, host, proclaims, it, a, festival, he, urges, me, to, drink, ten, cups, but, what, ten, cups, could, make, me, as, drunk, as, i, always, am, with, your, love, in, my, heart, tomorrow, the, mountains, will, separate, us, after, tomorrow, who, can, say, to, my, retired, friend, wei, z, ng, w, i, b, ch, sh, du, fu, is, the, first, person, in, the, historical, record, identified, as, a, diabetic, patient, in, his, later, years, he, suffered, from, diabetes, and, pulmonary, tuberculosis, and, died, on, board, a, ship, on, the, yangtze, river, aged, 58, years, old, criticism, of, du, fu, s, works, has, focused, on, his, strong, sense, of, history, his, moral, engagement, and, his, technical, excellence, since, the, song, dynasty, critics, have, called, du, fu, the, poet, saint, sh, sh, ng, the, most, directly, historical, of, his, poems, are, those, commenting, on, military, tactics, or, the, successes, and, failures, of, the, government, or, the, poems, of, advice, which, he, wrote, to, the, emperor, indirectly, he, wrote, about, the, effect, of, the, times, in, which, he, lived, on, himself, and, on, the, ordinary, people, of, china, as, watson, notes, this, is, information, of, a, kind, seldom, found, in, the, officially, compiled, histories, of, the, era, du, fu, s, political, comments, are, based, on, emotion, rather, than, calculation, his, prescriptions, have, been, paraphrased, as, let, us, all, be, less, selfish, let, us, all, do, what, we, are, supposed, to, do, since, his, views, were, impossible, to, disagree, with, his, forcefully, expressed, truisms, enabled, his, installation, as, the, central, figure, of, chinese, poetic, history, a, second, favourite, epithet, of, chinese, critics, is, that, of, poet, sage, sh, sh, ng, a, counterpart, to, the, philosophical, sage, confucius, one, of, the, earliest, surviving, works, the, song, of, the, wagons, from, around, 750, gives, voice, to, the, sufferings, of, a, conscript, soldier, in, the, imperial, army, and, a, clear, sighted, consciousness, of, suffering, these, concerns, are, continuously, articulated, in, poems, on, the, lives, of, both, soldiers, and, civilians, produced, by, du, fu, throughout, his, life, although, du, fu, s, frequent, references, to, his, own, difficulties, can, give, the, impression, of, an, all, consuming, solipsism, hawkes, argues, that, his, famous, compassion, in, fact, includes, himself, viewed, quite, objectively, and, almost, as, an, afterthought, he, therefore, lends, grandeur, to, the, wider, picture, by, comparing, it, to, his, own, slightly, comical, triviality, du, fu, s, compassion, for, himself, and, for, others, was, part, of, his, general, broadening, of, the, scope, of, poetry, he, devoted, many, works, to, topics, which, had, previously, been, considered, unsuitable, for, poetic, treatment, zhang, jie, wrote, that, for, du, fu, everything, in, this, world, is, poetry, du, wrote, extensively, on, subjects, such, as, domestic, life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and, other, poems, du, fu, s, work, is, notable, above, all, for, its, range, chinese, critics, traditionally, used, the, term, j, d, ch, ng, complete, symphony, a, reference, to, mencius, description, of, confucius, yuan, zhen, was, the, first, to, note, the, breadth, of, du, fu, s, achievement, writing, in, 813, that, his, predecessor, united, in, his, work, traits, which, previous, men, had, displayed, only, singly, he, mastered, all, the, forms, of, chinese, poetry, chou, says, that, in, every, form, he, either, made, outstanding, advances, or, contributed, outstanding, examples, furthermore, his, poems, use, a, wide, range, of, registers, from, the, direct, and, colloquial, to, the, allusive, and, self, consciously, literary, this, variety, is, manifested, even, within, individual, works, owen, identifies, the, rapid, stylistic, and, thematic, shifts, in, poems, which, enable, the, poet, to, represent, different, facets, of, a, situation, while, chou, uses, the, term, juxtaposition, as, the, major, analytical, tool, in, her, work, du, fu, is, noted, for, having, written, more, on, poetics, and, painting, than, any, other, writer, of, his, time, he, wrote, eighteen, poems, on, painting, alone, more, than, any, other, tang, poet, du, fu, s, seemingly, negative, commentary, on, the, prized, horse, paintings, of, han, gan, ignited, a, controversy, that, has, persisted, to, the, present, day, the, tenor, of, his, work, changed, as, he, developed, his, style, and, adapted, to, his, surroundings, chameleon, like, according, to, watson, his, earliest, works, are, in, a, relatively, derivative, courtly, style, but, he, came, into, his, own, in, the, years, of, the, rebellion, owen, comments, on, the, grim, simplicity, of, the, qinzhou, poems, which, mirrors, the, desert, landscape, the, works, from, his, chengdu, period, are, light, often, finely, observed, while, the, poems, from, the, late, kuizhou, period, have, a, density, and, power, of, vision, although, he, wrote, in, all, poetic, forms, du, fu, is, best, known, for, his, l, shi, a, type, of, poem, with, strict, constraints, on, form, and, content, for, example, leaving, the, audience, by, the, quiet, corridors, stately, and, beautiful, we, pass, through, the, palace, gates, turning, in, different, directions, you, go, to, the, west, with, the, ministers, of, state, i, otherwise, on, my, side, the, willow, twigs, are, fragile, greening, you, are, struck, by, scarlet, flowers, over, there, our, separate, ways, you, write, so, well, so, kindly, to, caution, in, vain, a, garrulous, old, man, memorial, in, reply, to, a, friend, s, advice, about, two, thirds, of, du, fu, s, 1500, extant, works, are, in, this, form, and, he, is, generally, considered, to, be, its, leading, exponent, his, best, l, shi, use, the, parallelisms, required, by, the, form, to, add, expressive, content, rather, than, as, mere, technical, restrictions, hawkes, comments, that, it, is, amazing, that, tu, fu, is, able, to, use, so, immensely, stylized, a, form, in, so, natural, a, manner, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, du, fu, s, writings, are, considered, by, many, literary, critics, to, be, among, the, greatest, of, all, time, and, it, states, his, dense, compressed, language, makes, use, of, all, the, connotative, overtones, of, a, phrase, and, of, all, the, intonational, potentials, of, the, individual, word, qualities, that, no, translation, can, ever, reveal, in, his, lifetime, and, immediately, following, his, death, du, fu, was, not, greatly, appreciated, in, part, this, can, be, attributed, to, his, stylistic, and, formal, innovations, some, of, which, are, still, considered, extremely, daring, and, bizarre, by, chinese, critics, there, are, few, contemporary, references, to, him, only, eleven, poems, from, six, writers, and, these, describe, him, in, terms, of, affection, but, not, as, a, paragon, of, poetic, or, moral, ideals, du, fu, is, also, poorly, represented, in, contemporary, anthologies, of, poetry, however, as, hung, notes, he, is, the, only, chinese, poet, whose, influence, grew, with, time, and, his, works, began, to, increase, in, popularity, in, the, ninth, century, early, positive, comments, came, from, bai, juyi, who, praised, the, moral, sentiments, of, some, of, du, fu, s, works, although, he, found, these, in, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, poems, and, from, han, yu, who, wrote, a, piece, defending, du, fu, and, li, bai, on, aesthetic, grounds, from, attacks, made, against, them, both, these, writers, showed, the, influence, of, du, fu, in, their, own, poetic, work, by, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, wei, zhuang, constructed, the, first, replica, of, his, thatched, cottage, in, sichuan, it, was, in, the, 11th, century, during, the, northern, song, era, that, du, fu, s, reputation, reached, its, peak, in, this, period, a, comprehensive, re, evaluation, of, earlier, poets, took, place, in, which, wang, wei, li, bai, and, du, fu, came, to, be, regarded, as, representing, respectively, the, buddhist, daoist, and, confucian, strands, of, chinese, culture, at, the, same, time, the, development, of, neo, confucianism, ensured, that, du, fu, as, its, poetic, exemplar, occupied, the, paramount, position, su, shi, famously, expressed, this, reasoning, when, he, wrote, that, du, fu, was, preeminent, because, through, all, his, vicissitudes, he, never, for, the, space, of, a, meal, forgot, his, sovereign, his, influence, was, helped, by, his, ability, to, reconcile, apparent, opposites, political, conservatives, were, attracted, by, his, loyalty, to, the, established, order, while, political, radicals, embraced, his, concern, for, the, poor, literary, conservatives, could, look, to, his, technical, mastery, while, literary, radicals, were, inspired, by, his, innovations, since, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, du, fu, s, loyalty, to, the, state, and, concern, for, the, poor, have, been, interpreted, as, embryonic, nationalism, and, socialism, and, he, has, been, praised, for, his, use, of, simple, people, s, language, du, fu, s, popularity, grew, to, such, an, extent, that, it, is, as, hard, to, measure, his, influence, as, that, of, shakespeare, in, england, it, was, hard, for, any, chinese, poet, not, to, be, influenced, by, him, while, there, was, never, another, du, fu, individual, poets, followed, in, the, traditions, of, specific, aspects, of, his, work, bai, juyi, s, concern, for, the, poor, lu, you, s, patriotism, and, mei, yaochen, s, reflections, on, the, quotidian, are, a, few, examples, more, broadly, du, fu, s, work, in, transforming, the, l, shi, from, mere, word, play, into, a, vehicle, for, serious, poetic, utterance, set, the, stage, for, every, subsequent, writer, in, the, genre, in, its, publishing, of, burton, watson, s, translation, of, du, fu, s, poems, the, columbia, university, press, commented, that, du, fu, has, been, called, china, s, greatest, poet, and, some, call, him, the, greatest, nonepic, nondramatic, poet, whose, writings, survive, in, any, language, du, fu, s, poetry, has, made, a, profound, impact, on, japanese, literature, especially, on, the, literature, from, the, muromachi, period, and, on, scholars, and, poets, in, the, edo, period, including, matsuo, bash, the, very, greatest, of, all, haiku, poets, even, in, modern, japanese, the, term, saint, of, poetry, shisei, is, mostly, synonymous, with, du, fu, until, the, 13th, century, the, japanese, preferred, bai, juyi, above, all, poets, and, there, were, few, references, to, du, fu, although, his, influence, can, be, seen, in, some, kanshi, chinese, poetry, made, by, japanese, poets, anthologies, such, as, bunka, sh, reish, in, the, 9th, century, the, first, notable, japanese, appreciator, of, du, fu, s, poetry, was, kokan, shiren, 1278, 1346, a, rinzai, zen, patriarch, and, one, of, the, most, prominent, authors, of, the, literature, of, the, five, mountains, he, highly, praised, du, fu, and, made, a, commentary, on, some, poems, of, du, fu, from, the, perspective, of, a, zen, priest, in, vol, 11, of, saihokush,
