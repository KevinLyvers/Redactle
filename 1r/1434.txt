of, the, cpy, to, join, them, in, paris, in, august, 1937, he, became, acting, general, secretary, of, the, cpy, he, later, explained, that, he, survived, the, purge, by, staying, out, of, spain, where, the, nkvd, was, active, and, also, by, avoiding, visiting, the, soviet, union, as, much, as, possible, when, first, appointed, as, general, secretary, he, avoided, travelling, to, moscow, by, insisting, that, he, needed, to, deal, with, some, disciplinary, issues, in, the, cpy, in, paris, he, also, promoted, the, idea, that, the, upper, echelons, of, the, cpy, should, be, sharing, the, dangers, of, underground, resistance, within, the, country, he, developed, a, new, younger, leadership, team, that, was, loyal, to, him, including, the, slovene, edvard, kardelj, the, serb,

government, it, was, eventually, broken, up, by, the, police, in, march, 1938, tito, returned, to, yugoslavia, from, paris, hearing, a, rumour, that, his, opponents, within, the, cpy, had, tipped, off, the, police, he, travelled, to, belgrade, rather, than, zagreb, and, used, a, different, passport, while, in, belgrade, he, stayed, with, a, young, intellectual, vladimir, dedijer, who, was, a, friend, of, ilas, arriving, in, yugoslavia, a, few, days, ahead, of, the, anschluss, between, nazi, germany, and, austria, he, made, an, appeal, condemning, it, in, which, the, cpy, was, joined, by,

bauer, were, arrested, as, imperialist, spies, both, were, eventually, released, polka, after, 27, months, in, prison, tito, therefore, needed, to, make, arrangements, for, the, care, of, arko, who, was, 14, he, placed, him, in, a, boarding, school, outside, kharkov, then, at, a, school, at, penza, but, he, ran, away, twice, and, was, eventually, taken, in, by, a, friend, s, mother, in, 1941, arko, joined, the, red, army, to, fight, the, invading, germans, some, of, tito, s, critics, argue, that, his, survival, indicates, he, must, have, denounced, his, comrades, as, trotskyists, he, was, asked, for, information, on, a, number, of, his, fellow, yugoslav, communists, but, according, to, his, own, statements, and, published, documents, he, never, denounced, anyone, usually, saying, he, did, not, know, them, in, one, case, he, was, asked, about, the, croatian, communist, leader, kamilo, horvatin, but, wrote, ambiguously, saying, that, he, did, not, know, whether, he, was, a, trotskyist, nevertheless, horvatin, was, not, heard, of, again, while, in, moscow, he, was, given, the, task, of, assisting, opi, to, translate, the, history, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, bolsheviks, into, serbo, croatian, but, they, had, only, got, to, the, second, chapter, when, opi, too, was, arrested, and, executed, he, worked, on, with, a, fellow, surviving, yugoslav, communist, but, a, yugoslav, communist, of, german, ethnicity, reported, an, inaccurate, translation, of, a, passage, and, claimed, it, showed, tito, was, a, trotskyist, other, influential, communists, vouched, for, him, and, he, was, exonerated, a, second, yugoslav, communist, denounced, him, but, the, action, backfired, and, his, accuser, was, arrested, several, factors, were, at, play, in, his, survival, his, working, class, origins, lack, of, interest, in, intellectual, arguments, about, socialism, attractive, personality, and, capacity, to, make, influential, friends, while, tito, was, avoiding, arrest, in, moscow, germany, was, placing, pressure, on, czechoslovakia, to, cede, the, sudetenland, in, response, to, this, threat, tito, organised, a, call, for, yugoslav, volunteers, to, fight, for, czechoslovakia, and, thousands, of, volunteers, came, to, the, czechoslovak, embassy, in, belgrade, to, offer, their, services, despite, the, eventual, munich, agreement, and, czechoslovak, acceptance, of, the, annexation, and, the, fact, that, the, volunteers, were, turned, away, tito, claimed, credit, for, the, yugoslav, response, which, worked, in, his, favour, by, this, stage, tito, was, well, aware, of, the, realities, in, the, soviet, union, later, saying, he, witnessed, a, great, many, injustices, but, was, too, heavily, invested, in, communism, and, too, loyal, to, the, soviet, union, to, step, back, after, restoring, the, image, of, a, decisive, coherent, and, non, fractional, cpy, to, the, comintern, executives, tito, was, by, october, 1938, reassured, that, the, party, would, not, be, disestablished, he, was, then, tasked, to, compile, two, resolutions, on, plans, of, future, cpy, activities, hoping, to, return, to, yugoslavia, before, the, 1938, yugoslavian, parliamentary, election, in, december, tito, requested, permission, to, do, so, from, comintern, s, georgi, dimitrov, several, times, saying, that, his, stay, in, moscow, was, greatly, prolonged, but, to, no, avail, the, comintern, formally, ratified, his, resolutions, on, 5, january, 1939, and, he, was, appointed, general, secretary, of, the, cpy, after, his, appointment, to, the, party, s, highest, position, of, leadership, the, newly, formed, politburo, of, the, central, committee, retained, the, old, leadership, team, of, tito, kardelj, ilas, aleksandar, rankovi,

the, transfer, of, the, possible, suspects, to, a, military, court, on, 7, march, 1945, the, provisional, government, of, the, democratic, federal, yugoslavia, dfy, was, assembled, in, belgrade, by, josip, broz, tito, while, the, provisional, name, allowed, for, either, a, republic, or, monarchy, this, government, was, headed, by, tito, as, provisional, yugoslav, prime, minister, and, included, representatives, from, the, royalist, government, in, exile, among, others, ivan, uba, i, in, accordance, with, the, agreement, between, resistance, leaders, and, the, government, in, exile, post, war, elections, were, held, to, determine, the, form, of, government, in, november, 1945, tito, s, pro, republican, people, s, front, led, by, the, communist, party, of, yugoslavia, won, the, elections, with, an, overwhelming, majority, the, vote, having, been, boycotted, by, monarchists, during, the, period, tito, evidently, enjoyed, massive, popular, support, due, to, being, generally, viewed, by, the, populace, as, the, liberator, of, yugoslavia, the, yugoslav, administration, in, the, immediate, post, war, period, managed, to, unite, a, country, that, had, been, severely, affected, by, ultra, nationalist, upheavals, and, war, devastation, while, successfully, suppressing, the, nationalist, sentiments, of, the, various, nations, in, favour, of, tolerance, and, the, common, yugoslav, goal, after, the, overwhelming, electoral, victory, tito, was, confirmed, as, the, prime, minister, and, the, minister, of, foreign, affairs, of, the, dfy, the, country, was, soon, renamed, the, federal, people, s, republic, of, yugoslavia, fpry, later, finally, renamed, into, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, sfry, on, 29, november, 1945, king, peter, ii, was, formally, deposed, by, the, yugoslav, constituent, assembly, the, assembly, drafted, a, new, republican, constitution, soon, afterwards, yugoslavia, organised, the, yugoslav, people, s, army, jugoslavenska, narodna, armija, jna, from, the, partisan, movement, and, became, the, fourth, strongest, army, in, europe, at, the, time, according, to, various, estimates, the, state, security, administration, uprava, dr, avne, bezbednosti, udba, was, also, formed, as, the, new, secret, police, along, with, a, security, agency, the, department, of, people, s, security, organ, za, tite, naroda, armije, ozna, yugoslav, intelligence, was, charged, with, imprisoning, and, bringing, to, trial, large, numbers, of, nazi, collaborators, controversially, this, included, catholic, clergymen, due, to, the, widespread, involvement, of, croatian, catholic, clergy, with, the, usta, a, regime, dra, a, mihailovi, was, found, guilty, of, collaboration, high, treason, and, war, crimes, and, was, subsequently, executed, by, firing, squad, in, july, 1946, prime, minister, josip, broz, tito, met, with, the, president, of, the, bishops, conference, of, yugoslavia, aloysius, stepinac, on, 4, june, 1945, two, days, after, his, release, from, imprisonment, the, two, could, not, reach, an, agreement, on, the, state, of, the, catholic, church, under, stepinac, s, leadership, the, bishops, conference, released, a, letter, condemning, alleged, partisan, war, crimes, in, september, 1945, the, next, year, stepinac, was, arrested, and, put, on, trial, which, some, saw, as, a, show, trial, in, october, 1946, in, its, first, special, session, for, 75, years, the, vatican, excommunicated, tito, and, the, yugoslav, government, for, sentencing, stepinac, to, 16, years, in, prison, on, charges, of, assisting, usta, e, terror, and, of, supporting, forced, conversions, of, serbs, to, catholicism, stepinac, received, preferential, treatment, in, recognition, of, his, status, and, the, sentence, was, soon, shortened, and, reduced, to, house, arrest, with, the, option, of, emigration, open, to, the, archbishop, at, the, conclusion, of, the, informbiro, period, reforms, rendered, yugoslavia, considerably, more, religiously, liberal, than, the, eastern, bloc, states, in, the, first, post, war, years, tito, was, widely, considered, a, communist, leader, very, loyal, to, moscow, indeed, he, was, often, viewed, as, second, only, to, stalin, in, the, eastern, bloc, in, fact, stalin, and, tito, had, an, uneasy, alliance, from, the, start, with, stalin, considering, tito, too, independent, from, 1946, to, 1948, tito, actively, engaged, in, building, an, alliance, with, neighbouring, communist, albania, with, the, intent, of, incorporating, albania, into, yugoslavia, according, to, enver, hoxha, the, then, communist, ruler, of, albania, in, the, summer, of, 1946, tito, promised, hoxha, that, the, yugoslav, province, of, kosovo, would, be, ceded, to, albania, despite, the, decision, of, unification, being, agreed, upon, by, yugoslav, communists, during, the, bujan, conference, the, plan, never, materialised, in, the, first, post, war, years, in, kosovo, tito, enacted, the, policy, of, banning, the, return, of, serb, colonists, to, kosovo, in, addition, to, enacting, the, first, large, scale, primary, education, program, of, the, albanian, language, during, the, immediate, post, war, period, tito, s, yugoslavia, had, a, strong, commitment, to, orthodox, marxist, ideas, harsh, repressive, measures, against, dissidents, and, enemies, of, the, state, were, common, from, government, agents, although, not, known, to, be, under, tito, s, orders, including, arrests, show, trials, forced, collectivisation, suppression, of, churches, and, religion, as, the, leader, of, yugoslavia, tito, displayed, a, fondness, for, luxury, taking, over, the, royal, palaces, that, had, belonged, to, the, house, of, kara, or, evi, together, with, the, former, palaces, used, by, the, house, of, habsburg, in, yugoslavia, his, tours, across, yugoslavia, in, his, luxury, blue, train, closely, resembled, the, royal, tours, of, the, kara, or, evi, kings, and, habsburg, emperors, and, in, serbia, he, also, adopted, the, traditional, royal, custom, of, being, a, godfather, to, every, 9th, son, although, he, modified, it, to, include, daughters, as, well, after, criticism, was, made, that, the, practice, was, sexist, just, like, a, serbian, king, tito, would, appear, wherever, a, 9th, child, was, born, to, a, family, to, congratulate, the, parents, and, give, them, cash, tito, always, spoke, very, harshly, of, the, kara, or, evi, kings, in, both, public, and, private, through, in, private, he, sometimes, had, a, kind, word, for, the, habsburgs, but, in, many, ways, he, appeared, to, his, people, as, sort, of, a, king, unlike, other, states, in, east, central, europe, liberated, by, allied, forces, yugoslavia, liberated, itself, from, axis, domination, with, limited, direct, support, from, the, red, army, tito, s, leading, role, in, liberating, yugoslavia, not, only, greatly, strengthened, his, position, in, his, party, and, among, the, yugoslav, people, but, also, caused, him, to, be, more, insistent, that, yugoslavia, had, more, room, to, follow, its, own, interests, than, other, bloc, leaders, who, had, more, reasons, to, recognise, soviet, efforts, in, helping, them, liberate, their, own, countries, from, axis, control, although, tito, was, formally, an, ally, of, stalin, after, world, war, ii, the, soviets, had, set, up, a, spy, ring, in, the, yugoslav, party, as, early, as, 1945, giving, way, to, an, uneasy, alliance, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, several, armed, incidents, occurred, between, yugoslavia, and, the, western, allies, following, the, war, yugoslavia, acquired, the, italian, territory, of, istria, as, well, as, the, cities, of, zadar, and, rijeka, yugoslav, leadership, was, looking, to, incorporate, trieste, into, the, country, as, well, which, was, opposed, by, the, western, allies, this, led, to, several, armed, incidents, notably, attacks, by, yugoslav, fighter, planes, on, u, s, transport, aircraft, causing, bitter, criticism, from, the, west, in, 1946, alone, yugoslav, air, force, shot, down, two, u, s, transport, aircraft, the, passengers, and, crew, of, the, first, plane, were, secretly, interned, by, the, yugoslav, government, the, second, plane, and, its, crew, were, a, total, loss, the, u, s, was, outraged, and, sent, an, ultimatum, to, the, yugoslav, government, demanding, the, release, of, the, americans, in, custody, u, s, access, to, the, downed, planes, and, full, investigation, of, the, incidents, stalin, was, opposed, to, what, he, felt, were, such, provocations, as, he, believed, the, ussr, unready, to, face, the, west, in, open, war, so, soon, after, the, losses, of, world, war, ii, and, at, the, time, when, u, s, had, operational, nuclear, weapons, whereas, the, ussr, had, yet, to, conduct, its, first, test, in, addition, tito, was, openly, supportive, of, the, communist, side, in, the, greek, civil, war, while, stalin, kept, his, distance, having, agreed, with, churchill, not, to, pursue, soviet, interests, there, although, he, did, support, the, greek, communist, struggle, politically, as, demonstrated, in, several, assemblies, of, the, un, security, council, in, 1948, motivated, by, the, desire, to, create, a, strong, independent, economy, tito, modelled, his, economic, development, plan, independently, from, moscow, which, resulted, in, a, diplomatic, escalation, followed, by, a, bitter, exchange, of, letters, in, which, tito, wrote, that, we, study, and, take, as, an, example, the, soviet, system, but, we, are, developing, socialism, in, our, country, in, somewhat, different, forms, the, soviet, answer, on, 4, may, admonished, tito, and, the, communist, party, of, yugoslavia, cpy, for, failing, to, admit, and, correct, its, mistakes, and, went, on, to, accuse, them, of, being, too, proud, of, their, successes, against, the, germans, maintaining, that, the, red, army, had, saved, them, from, destruction, tito, s, response, on, 17, may, suggested, that, the, matter, be, settled, at, the, meeting, of, the, cominform, to, be, held, that, june, however, tito, did, not, attend, the, second, meeting, of, the, cominform, fearing, that, yugoslavia, was, to, be, openly, attacked, in, 1949, the, crisis, nearly, escalated, into, an, armed, conflict, as, hungarian, and, soviet, forces, were, massing, on, the, northern, yugoslav, frontier, an, invasion, of, yugoslavia, was, planned, to, be, carried, out, in, 1949, via, the, combined, forces, of, neighbouring, soviet, satellite, states, of, hungary, romania, bulgaria, and, albania, followed, by, the, subsequent, removal, of, tito, s, government, on, 28, june, the, other, member, countries, of, the, cominform, expelled, yugoslavia, citing, nationalist, elements, that, had, managed, in, the, course, of, the, past, five, or, six, months, to, reach, a, dominant, position, in, the, leadership, of, the, cpy, the, hungarian, and, romanian, armies, were, expanded, in, size, and, together, with, soviet, ones, massed, on, the, yugoslav, border, the, assumption, in, moscow, was, that, once, it, was, known, that, he, had, lost, soviet, approval, tito, would, collapse, i, will, shake, my, little, finger, and, there, will, be, no, more, tito, stalin, remarked, the, expulsion, effectively, banished, yugoslavia, from, the, international, association, of, socialist, states, while, other, socialist, states, of, eastern, europe, subsequently, underwent, purges, of, alleged, titoists, stalin, took, the, matter, personally, and, arranged, several, assassination, attempts, on, tito, s, life, none, of, which, succeeded, in, one, correspondence, between, them, tito, openly, wrote, stop, sending, people, to, kill, me, we, ve, already, captured, five, of, them, one, of, them, with, a, bomb, and, another, with, a, rifle, if, you, don, t, stop, sending, killers, i, ll, send, one, to, moscow, and, i, won, t, have, to, send, a, second, one, significant, consequence, of, the, tension, arising, between, yugoslavia, and, the, soviet, union, was, tito, s, decision, to, begin, large, scale, repression, against, enemies, of, the, government, this, repression, was, not, limited, to, known, and, alleged, stalinists, but, also, included, members, of, the, communist, party, or, anyone, exhibiting, sympathy, towards, the, soviet, union, prominent, partisans, such, as, vlado, dap, evi, and, dragoljub, mi, unovi, were, victims, of, this, period, of, strong, repression, which, lasted, until, 1956, and, was, marked, by, significant, violations, of, human, rights, tens, of, thousands, of, political, opponents, served, in, forced, labour, camps, such, as, goli, otok, meaning, barren, island, and, hundreds, died, an, often, disputed, but, relatively, feasible, number, that, was, put, forth, by, the, yugoslav, government, itself, in, 1964, places, the, number, of, goli, otok, inmates, incarcerated, between, 1948, and, 1956, to, be, 16, 554, with, less, than, 600, having, died, during, detention, the, facilities, at, goli, otok, were, abandoned, in, 1956, and, jurisdiction, of, the, now, defunct, political, prison, was, handed, over, to, the, government, of, the, socialist, republic, of, croatia, tito, s, estrangement, from, the, ussr, enabled, yugoslavia, to, obtain, u, s, aid, via, the, economic, cooperation, administration, eca, the, same, u, s, aid, institution, that, administered, the, marshall, plan, still, tito, did, not, agree, to, align, with, the, west, which, was, a, common, consequence, of, accepting, american, aid, at, the, time, after, stalin, s, death, in, 1953, relations, with, the, ussr, were, relaxed, and, tito, began, to, receive, aid, from, the, comecon, as, well, in, this, way, tito, played, east, west, antagonism, to, his, advantage, instead, of, choosing, sides, he, was, instrumental, in, kick, starting, the, non, aligned, movement, which, would, function, as, a, third, way, for, countries, interested, in, staying, outside, of, the, east, west, divide, the, event, was, significant, not, only, for, yugoslavia, and, tito, but, also, for, the, global, development, of, socialism, since, it, was, the, first, major, split, between, communist, states, casting, doubt, on, comintern, s, claims, for, socialism, to, be, a, unified, force, that, would, eventually, control, the, whole, world, as, tito, became, the, first, and, the, only, successful, socialist, leader, to, defy, stalin, s, leadership, in, the, cominform, this, rift, with, the, soviet, union, brought, tito, much, international, recognition, but, also, triggered, a, period, of, instability, often, referred, to, as, the, informbiro, period, tito, s, form, of, communism, was, labelled, titoism, by, moscow, which, encouraged, purges, and, repression, against, suspected, and, accused, titoites, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, some, trotskyists, considered, tito, to, be, an, unconscious, trotskyist, because, of, the, split, however, this, was, rejected, by, ted, grant, in, 1949, who, asserted, there, were, no, fundamental, principled, differences, between, stalin, and, tito, he, said, they, were, both, proletarian, bonapartists, ruling, deformed, workers, states, tito, modelling, his, regime, on, that, of, stalin, s, on, 26, june, 1950, the, national, assembly, supported, a, crucial, bill, written, by, milovan, ilas, and, tito, regarding, socialist, self, management, a, type, of, cooperative, independent, socialist, experiment, that, introduced, profit, sharing, and, workplace, democracy, in, previously, state, run, enterprises, which, then, came, under, direct, social, ownership, of, the, employees, on, 13, january, 1953, they, established, that, the, law, on, self, management, was, the, basis, of, the, entire, social, order, in, yugoslavia, tito, also, succeeded, ivan, ribar, as, the, president, of, yugoslavia, on, 14, january, 1953, becoming, the, official, head, of, state, after, stalin, s, death, tito, rejected, the, ussr, s, invitation, for, a, visit, to, discuss, the, normalisation, of, relations, between, the, two, nations, nikita, khrushchev, and, nikolai, bulganin, visited, tito, in, belgrade, in, 1955, and, apologised, for, wrongdoings, by, stalin, s, administration, signing, the, belgrade, declaration, tito, visited, the, ussr, in, 1956, which, signalled, to, the, world, that, animosity, between, yugoslavia, and, ussr, was, easing, rapprochement, between, the, two, countries, would, not, last, long, as, yugoslav, leadership, took, an, increasingly, explicit, posture, of, non, alignment, in, the, aftermath, of, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, relations, further, deteriorated, in, the, late, 1960s, because, of, yugoslav, economic, reforms, which, consciously, linked, yugoslavia, to, the, international, system, as, well, as, tito, s, support, for, the, prague, spring, which, itself, found, much, of, its, inspiration, in, yugoslav, market, socialism, and, opposition, to, the, subsequent, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, the, tito, stalin, split, had, large, ramifications, for, countries, outside, the, ussr, and, yugoslavia, it, has, for, example, been, given, as, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, sl, nsk, trial, in, czechoslovakia, in, which, 14, high, level, communist, officials, were, purged, with, 11, of, them, being, executed, stalin, put, pressure, on, czechoslovakia, to, conduct, purges, in, order, to, discourage, the, spread, of, the, idea, of, a, national, path, to, socialism, which, tito, espoused, under, tito, s, leadership, yugoslavia, became, a, founding, member, of, the, non, aligned, movement, in, 1961, tito, co, founded, the, movement, with, egypt, s, gamal, abdel, nasser, india, s, jawaharlal, nehru, indonesia, s, sukarno, and, ghana, s, kwame, nkrumah, in, an, action, called, the, initiative, of, five, tito, nehru, nasser, sukarno, nkrumah, thus, establishing, strong, ties, with, third, world, countries, this, move, did, much, to, improve, yugoslavia, s, diplomatic, position, tito, saw, the, non, aligned, movement, as, a, way, of, presenting, himself, as, a, world, leader, of, an, important, bloc, of, nations, that, would, improve, his, bargaining, power, with, both, the, eastern, and, western, blocs, on, 1, september, 1961, josip, broz, tito, became, the, first, secretary, general, of, the, non, aligned, movement, tito, s, foreign, policy, led, to, relationships, with, a, variety, of, governments, such, as, exchanging, visits, 1954, and, 1956, with, emperor, haile, selassie, of, ethiopia, where, a, street, was, named, in, his, honour, in, 1953, tito, visited, ethiopia, and, in, 1954, the, emperor, visited, yugoslavia, tito, s, motives, in, befriending, ethiopia, were, somewhat, self, interested, as, he, wanted, to, send, recent, graduates, of, yugoslav, universities, whose, standards, were, not, up, to, those, of, western, universities, thus, making, them, unemployable, in, the, west, to, work, in, ethiopia, which, was, one, of, the, few, countries, that, was, willing, to, accept, them, as, ethiopia, did, not, have, much, of, a, health, care, system, or, a, university, system, haile, selassie, from, 1953, onward, encouraged, the, graduates, of, yugoslav, universities, especially, with, medical, degrees, to, come, work, in, his, empire, reflecting, his, tendency, to, pursue, closer, ties, with, third, world, nations, from, 1950, onward, tito, permitted, mexican, films, to, be, shown, in, yugoslavia, where, they, became, very, popular, especially, the, 1950, film, un, d, a, de, vida, which, become, a, huge, hit, when, it, premiered, in, yugoslavia, in, 1952, the, success, of, mexican, films, led, to, the, yu, mex, craze, of, the, 1950s, 1960s, as, mexican, music, became, popular, and, it, was, fashionable, for, many, yugoslav, musicians, to, don, sombreros, and, sing, mexican, songs, in, serbo, croatian, tito, was, notable, for, pursuing, a, foreign, policy, of, neutrality, during, the, cold, war, and, for, establishing, close, ties, with, developing, countries, tito, s, strong, belief, in, self, determination, caused, the, 1948, rift, with, stalin, and, consequently, the, eastern, bloc, his, public, speeches, often, reiterated, that, policy, of, neutrality, and, co, operation, with, all, countries, would, be, natural, as, long, as, these, countries, did, not, use, their, influence, to, pressure, yugoslavia, to, take, sides, relations, with, the, united, states, and, western, european, nations, were, generally, cordial, in, the, early, 1950s, yugoslav, hungarian, relations, were, strained, as, tito, made, little, secret, of, his, distaste, for, the, stalinist, m, ty, s, r, kosi, and, his, preference, for, the, national, communist, imre, nagy, instead, tito, s, decision, to, create, a, balkan, pact, by, signing, a, treaty, of, alliance, with, nato, members, turkey, and, greece, in, 1954, was, regarded, as, tantamount, to, joining, nato, in, soviet, eyes, and, his, vague, talk, of, a, neutralist, communist, federation, of, eastern, european, states, was, seen, as, a, major, threat, in, moscow, the, yugoslav, embassy, in, budapest, was, seen, by, the, soviets, as, a, centre, of, subversion, in, hungary, as, they, accused, yugoslav, diplomats, and, journalists, sometimes, with, justification, of, supporting, nagy, however, when, the, revolt, broke, out, in, hungary, in, october, 1956, tito, accused, nagy, of, losing, control, of, the, situation, as, he, wanted, a, communist, hungary, independent, of, the, soviet, union, not, the, overthrow, of, hungarian, communism, on, 31, october, 1956, tito, ordered, the, yugoslav, media, to, stop, praising, nagy, and, he, quietly, supported, the, soviet, intervention, on, 4, november, to, end, the, revolt, in, hungary, as, he, believed, that, a, hungary, ruled, by, anti, communists, would, pursue, irredentist, claims, against, yugoslavia, as, had, just, been, the, case, during, the, interwar, period, to, escape, from, the, soviets, nagy, fled, to, the, yugoslav, embassy, where, tito, granted, him, asylum, on, 5, november, 1956, soviet, tanks, shelled, the, yugoslav, embassy, in, budapest, killing, the, yugoslav, cultural, attache, and, several, other, diplomats, tito, s, refusal, to, turn, over, nagy, despite, increasingly, shrill, soviet, demands, that, he, do, so, served, his, purposes, well, with, relations, with, the, western, states, as, he, was, presented, in, the, western, media, as, the, good, communist, who, stood, up, to, moscow, by, sheltering, nagy, and, the, other, hungarian, leaders, on, 22, november, nagy, and, his, cabinet, left, the, embassy, on, a, bus, that, took, them, into, exile, in, yugoslavia, after, the, new, hungarian, leader, j, nos, k, d, r, had, promised, tito, in, writing, that, they, would, not, be, harmed, much, to, tito, s, fury, when, the, bus, left, the, yugoslav, embassy, it, was, promptly, boarded, by, kgb, agents, who, arrested, the, hungarian, leaders, and, roughly, handled, the, yugoslav, diplomats, who, tried, to, protect, them, nagy, s, kidnapping, followed, by, his, execution, almost, led, yugoslavia, to, break, off, diplomatic, relations, with, the, soviet, union, and, in, 1957, tito, boycotted, the, ceremonials, in, moscow, for, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, the, only, communist, leader, who, did, not, attend, yugoslavia, had, a, liberal, travel, policy, permitting, foreigners, to, freely, travel, through, the, country, and, its, citizens, to, travel, worldwide, whereas, it, was, limited, by, most, communist, countries, a, number, of, yugoslav, citizens, worked, throughout, western, europe, tito, met, many, world, leaders, during, his, rule, such, as, soviet, rulers, joseph, stalin, nikita, khrushchev, and, leonid, brezhnev, egypt, s, gamal, abdel, nasser, indian, politicians, jawaharlal, nehru, and, indira, gandhi, british, prime, ministers, winston, churchill, james, callaghan, and, margaret, thatcher, u, s, presidents, dwight, d, eisenhower, john, f, kennedy, richard, nixon, gerald, ford, and, jimmy, carter, other, political, leaders, dignitaries, and, heads, of, state, that, tito, met, at, least, once, in, his, lifetime, included, che, guevara, fidel, castro, yasser, arafat, willy, brandt, helmut, schmidt, georges, pompidou, kwame, nkrumah, queen, elizabeth, ii, hua, guofeng, kim, il, sung, sukarno, sheikh,

algerian, national, liberation, front, fln, to, the, united, nations, in, january, 1958, the, french, navy, boarded, the, slovenija, cargo, ship, off, oran, whose, holds, were, filled, with, weapons, for, the, insurgents, diplomat, danilo, mili, explained, that, tito, and, the, leading, nucleus, of, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, really, saw, in, the, third, world, s, liberation, struggles, a, replica, of, their, own, struggle, against, the, fascist, occupants, they, vibrated, to, the, rhythm, of, the, advances, or, setbacks, of, the, fln, or, viet, cong, thousands, of, yugoslav, military, advisors, travelled, to, guinea, after, its, decolonisation, and, as, the, french, government, tried, to, destabilise, the, country, tito, also, covertly, helped, left, wing, liberation, movements, to, destabilise, the, portuguese, colonial, empire, he, saw, the, murder, of, patrice, lumumba, in, 1961, as, the, greatest, crime, in, contemporary, history, the, country, s, military, academies, hosted, left, wing, activists, from, swapo, namibia, and, the, pan, africanist, congress, of, azania, south, africa, as, part, of, tito, s, efforts, to, undermine, apartheid, in,

yugoslavia, the, operation, was, aimed, at, overthrowing, tito, and, was, planned, during, the, 1980, summer, olympics, in, moscow, so, that, the, soviets, would, be, too, busy, to, react, the, operation, was, finally, abandoned, due, to, tito, s, death, in, 1953, tito, travelled, to, britain, for, a, state, visit, and, met, with, winston, churchill, he, also, toured, cambridge, and, visited, the, university, library, tito, visited, india, from, 22, december, 1954, to, 8, january, 1955, after, his, return, he, removed, many, restrictions, on, yugoslavia, s, churches, and, spiritual, institutions, tito, also, developed, warm, relations, with, burma, under, u, nu, travelling, to, the, country, in, 1955, and, again, in, 1959, though, he, did, not, receive, the, same, treatment, in, 1959, from, the, new, leader, ne, win, tito, had, an, especially, close, friendship, with, prince, norodom, sihanouk, of, cambodia, who, preached, an, eccentric, mixture, of, monarchism, buddhism, and, socialism, and, like, tito, wanted, his, country, to, be, neutral, in, the, cold, war, tito, saw, sihanouk, as, something, of, a, kindred, soul, who, like, him, had, to, struggle, to, maintain, his, backward, country, s, neutrality, in, the, face, of, rival, power, blocs, by, contrast, tito, strongly, disliked, president, idi, amin, of, uganda, whom, he, saw, as, thuggish, and, possibly, insane, because, of, its, neutrality, yugoslavia, was, often, rare, among, communist, countries, in, having, diplomatic, relations, with, right, wing, anti, communist, governments, for, example, yugoslavia, was, the, only, communist, country, that, had, diplomatic, relations, with, alfredo, stroessner, s, paraguay, yugoslavia, went, on, to, sell, arms, to, the, staunchly, anti, communist, regime, of, guatemala, under, kjell, eugenio, laugerud, garc, a, during, the, guatemalan, civil, war, notable, exceptions, to, yugoslavia, s, neutral, stance, toward, anti, communist, countries, include, spain, under, franco, greece, under, greek, junta, and, chile, under, pinochet, yugoslavia, was, one, of, many, countries, that, severed, diplomatic, relations, with, chile, after, salvador, allende, was, overthrown, starting, in, the, 1950s, tito, s, government, permitted, yugoslav, workers, to, go, to, western, europe, especially, west, germany, as, gastarbeiter, guest, workers, the, exposure, of, many, yugoslavs, to, the, west, and, its, culture, led, many, yugoslavians, to, view, themselves, as, culturally, closer, to, western, europe, than, eastern, europe, in, the, autumn, of, 1960, tito, met, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, at, the, united, nations, general, assembly, meeting, they, discussed, a, range, of, issues, from, arms, control, to, economic, development, when, eisenhower, remarked, that, yugoslavia, s, neutrality, was, neutral, on, his, side, tito, replied, that, neutrality, did, not, imply, passivity, but, meant, not, taking, sides, on, 7, april, 1963, the, country, changed, its, official, name, from, federal, people, s, republic, to, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, economic, reforms, encouraged, smallscale, private, enterprise, up, to, five, full, time, workers, most, of, these, were, family, businesses, and, largest, in, agriculture, and, greatly, relaxed, restrictions, on, religious, expression, tito, subsequently, toured, the, americas, in, chile, two, government, ministers, resigned, over, his, visit, to, that, country, in, 1966, an, agreement, with, the, holy, see, fostered, in, part, by, the, death, in, 1960, of, the, anti, communist, archbishop, of, zagreb, aloysius, stepinac, and, shifts, in, the, church, s, approach, to, resisting, communism, originating, in, the, second, vatican, council, accorded, new, freedom, to, the, yugoslav, roman, catholic, church, particularly, to, catechise, and, open, seminaries, the, agreement, also, eased, tensions, which, had, prevented, the, naming, of, new, bishops, in, yugoslavia, since, 1945, holy, see, and, yugoslavia, reconciled, their, relations, and, worked, together, on, achieving, peace, in, vietnam, tito, s, new, socialism, met, opposition, from, traditional, communists, culminating, in, a, conspiracy, headed, by, aleksandar, rankovi, allegedly, the, charge, on, which, he, was, removed, from, power, and, expelled, from, the, lcy, was, that, he, bugged, tito, s, working, and, sleeping, quarters, as, well, as, those, of, many, other, high, government, officials, for, almost, 20, years, rankovi, was, at, the, head, of, the, state, security, administration, udba, as, well, as, federal, secretary, of, internal, affairs, his, position, as, a, party, whip, and, tito, s, way, of, controlling, and, monitoring, the, government, and, to, a, certain, extent, the, people, bothered, many, especially, the, younger, generation, of, government, officials, who, were, working, toward, a, more, liberal, yugoslav, society, in, the, same, year, tito, declared, that, communists, must, henceforth, chart, yugoslavia, s, course, by, the, force, of, their, arguments, implying, an, abandonment, of, leninist, orthodoxy, and, development, of, liberal, socialism, on, 1, january, 1967, yugoslavia, became, the, first, communist, country, to, open, its, borders, to, all, foreign, visitors, and, abolish, visa, requirements, in, the, same, year, tito, became, active, in, promoting, a, peaceful, resolution, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, his, plan, called, for, arabs, to, recognise, the, state, of, israel, in, exchange, for, territories, israel, newly, occupied, in, 1968, tito, offered, to, fly, to, prague, on, three, hours, notice, if, czechoslovak, leader, alexander, dub, ek, needed, help, in, facing, down, the, soviets, in, april, 1969, tito, removed, generals, ivan, go, njak, and, rade, hamovi, in, the, aftermath, of, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, due, to, the, unpreparedness, of, the, yugoslav, army, to, respond, to, a, similar, invasion, of, yugoslavia, in, 1971, the, federal, assembly, reelected, tito, as, president, of, yugoslavia, for, the, sixth, time, in, his, speech, before, the, federal, assembly, he, introduced, 20, sweeping, constitutional, amendments, to, provide, an, updated, framework, on, which, the, country, would, be, based, the, amendments, provided, for, a, collective, presidency, a, 22, member, body, consisting, of, elected, representatives, from, six, republics, and, two, autonomous, provinces, the, body, would, have, a, single, chairman, of, the, presidency, and, chairmanship, would, rotate, among, six, republics, when, the, federal, assembly, failed, to, agree, on, legislation, the, collective, presidency, would, have, the, power, to, rule, by, decree, amendments, also, provided, for, a, stronger, cabinet, with, considerable, power, to, initiate, and, pursue, legislation, independently, from, the, communist, party, d, emal, bijedi, was, chosen, as, the, premier, the, new, amendments, aimed, to, decentralise, the, country, by, granting, greater, autonomy, to, republics, and, provinces, the, federal, government, would, retain, authority, only, over, foreign, affairs, defence, internal, security, monetary, affairs, free, trade, within, yugoslavia, and, development, loans, to, poorer, regions, control, of, education, healthcare, and, housing, would, be, exercised, entirely, by, the, governments, of, the, republics, and, the, autonomous, provinces, tito, s, greatest, strength, in, the, eyes, of, the, western, communists, had, been, in, suppressing, nationalist, insurrections, and, maintaining, unity, throughout, the, country, it, was, tito, s, call, for, brotherhood, and, unity, and, related, methods, that, held, together, the, people, of, yugoslavia, this, ability, was, put, to, a, test, several, times, during, his, reign, notably, during, the, croatian, spring, also, referred, as, the, masovni, pokret, or, maspok, for, short, meaning, mass, movement, when, the, government, suppressed, both, public, demonstrations, and, dissenting, opinions, within, the, communist, party, despite, this, suppression, much, of, maspok, s, demands, including, for, decentralisation, were, later, realised, with, the, new, constitution, heavily, backed, by, tito, himself, against, opposition, from, the, serbian, branch, of, the, party, who, favoured, centralisation, on, 16, may, 1974, the, new, constitution, was, passed, and, the, 82, year, old, tito, was, named, president, for, life, but, the, 1974, constitution, caused, issues, for, the, yugoslavian, economy, and, distorted, its, market, mechanism, leading, to, escalation, of, ethnic, tensions, tito, s, visits, to, the, u, s, avoided, most, of, the, northeast, due, to, large, minorities, of, yugoslav, emigrants, bitter, about, communism, in, yugoslavia, security, for, the, state, visits, was, usually, high, to, keep, him, away, from, protesters, who, frequently, burned, the, yugoslav, flag, during, a, visit, to, the, united, nations, in, the, late, 1970s, emigrants, shouted, tito, murderer, outside, his, new, york, hotel, which, he, protested, to, united, states, authorities, after, the, constitutional, changes, of, 1974, tito, began, reducing, his, role, in, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, state, transferring, much, of, it, to, the, prime, minister, who, was, the, head, of, government, but, retained, the, final, word, on, all, major, policy, decisions, as, president, and, head, of, state, and, as, the, head, of, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, the, 40th, anniversary, of, his, communist, party, leadership, was, observed, on, the, youth, day, of, 1977, throughout, yugoslavia, he, continued, to, travel, abroad, and, receive, foreign, visitors, going, to, beijing, in, 1977, and, reconciling, with, the, chinese, leadership, that, had, once, branded, him, a, revisionist, in, turn, chairman, hua, guofeng, visited, yugoslavia, in, 1979, in, 1978, tito, travelled, to, the, u, s, during, the, visit, strict, security, was, imposed, in, washington, d, c, owing, to, protests, by, anti, communist, croat, serb, and, albanian, groups, tito, became, increasingly, ill, over, the, course, of, 1979, during, this, time, vila, srna, was, built, for, his, use, near, morovi, in, the, event, of, his, recovery, on, 7, january, and, again, on, 12, january, 1980, tito, was, admitted, to, the, medical, centre, in, ljubljana, the, capital, city, of, the, sr, slovenia, with, circulation, problems, in, his, legs, tito, s, stubbornness, and, refusal, to, allow, doctors, to, follow, through, with, the, necessary, amputation, of, his, left, leg, played, a, part, in, his, eventual, death, of, gangrene, induced, infection, his, adjutant, later, testified, that, tito, threatened, to, take, his, own, life, if, his, leg, was, ever, amputated, and, that, he, had, to, hide, tito, s, pistol, in, fear, that, he, would, follow, through, on, his, threat, after, a, private, conversation, with, his, sons, arko, and, mi, o, broz, he, finally, agreed, and, his, left, leg, was, amputated, due, to, arterial, blockages, the, amputation, proved, to, be, too, late, and, tito, died, at, the, medical, centre, of, ljubljana, on, 4, may, 1980, three, days, short, of, his, 88th, birthday, the, state, funeral, of, josip, broz, tito, drew, many, world, statesmen, it, attracted, government, leaders, from, 129, states, based, on, the, number, of, attending, politicians, and, state, delegations, at, the, time, it, was, the, largest, state, funeral, in, history, this, concentration, of, dignitaries, would, be, unmatched, until, the, funeral, of, pope, john, paul, ii, in, 2005, and, the, memorial, service, of, nelson, mandela, in, 2013, those, who, attended, included, four, kings, 31, presidents, six, princes, 22, prime, ministers, and, 47, ministers, of, foreign, affairs, they, came, from, both, sides, of, the, cold, war, from, 128, countries, out, of, 154, un, members, at, the, time, reporting, on, his, death, the, new, york, times, wrote, tito, sought, to, improve, life, unlike, others, who, rose, to, power, on, the, communist, wave, after, wwii, tito, did, not, long, demand, that, his, people, suffer, for, a, distant, vision, of, a, better, life, after, an, initial, soviet, influenced, bleak, period, tito, moved, toward, radical, improvement, of, life, in, the, country, yugoslavia, gradually, became, a, bright, spot, amid, the, general, grayness, of, eastern, europe, tito, was, interred, in, the, house, of, flowers, a, mausoleum, in, belgrade, which, forms, part, of, a, memorial, complex, in, the, grounds, of, the, museum, of, yugoslav, history, formerly, called, museum, 25, may, and, museum, of, the, revolution, the, museum, keeps, the, gifts, tito, received, during, his, presidency, the, collection, includes, original, prints, of, los, caprichos, by, francisco, goya, and, many, others, dominic, mcgoldrick, writes, that, as, the, head, of, a, highly, centralised, and, oppressive, regime, tito, wielded, tremendous, power, in, yugoslavia, with, his, authoritarian, rule, administered, through, an, elaborate, bureaucracy, that, routinely, suppressed, human, rights, the, main, victims, of, this, repression, during, the, first, years, were, known, and, alleged, stalinists, such, as, dragoslav, mihailovi, and, dragoljub, mi, unovi, but, in, later, years, even, some, of, the, most, prominent, of, tito, s, collaborators, were, arrested, on, 19, november, 1956, milovan, ilas, perhaps, the, closest, of, tito, s, collaborators, widely, regarded, as, his, possible, successor, was, arrested, because, of, his, criticism, of, tito, s, regime, victor, sebestyen, writes, that, tito, was, as, brutal, as, stalin, the, repression, did, not, exclude, intellectuals, and, writers, such, as, venko, markovski, who, was, arrested, and, sent, to, jail, in, january, 1956, for, writing, poems, considered, anti, titoist, even, if, after, the, reforms, of, 1961, tito, s, presidency, had, become, comparatively, more, liberal, than, other, communist, regimes, the, communist, party, continued, to, alternate, between, liberalism, and, repression, yugoslavia, managed, to, remain, independent, from, the, soviet, union, and, its, brand, of, socialism, was, in, many, ways, the, envy, of, eastern, europe, but, tito, s, yugoslavia, remained, a, tightly, controlled, police, state, according, to, david, matas, outside, the, soviet, union, yugoslavia, had, more, political, prisoners, than, all, of, the, rest, of, eastern, europe, combined, tito, s, secret, police, were, modelled, on, the, soviet, kgb, its, members, were, ever, present, and, often, acted, extrajudicially, with, victims, including, middle, class, intellectuals, liberals, and, democrats, yugoslavia, was, a, signatory, to, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, but, scant, regard, was, paid, to, its, provisions, tito, s, yugoslavia, was, based, on, respect, for, nationality, though, tito, ruthlessly, purged, any, flowerings, of, nationalism, that, threatened, the, yugoslav, federation, but, the, contrast, between, the, deference, given, to, some, ethnic, groups, and, the, severe, repression, of, others, was, sharp, yugoslav, law, guaranteed, nationalities, to, use, their, language, but, for, ethnic, albanians, the, assertion, of, ethnic, identity, was, severely, limited, almost, half, of, yugoslavia, s, political, prisoners, were, ethnic, albanians, imprisoned, for, asserting, their, ethnic, identity, yugoslavia, s, post, war, development, was, impressive, but, the, country, ran, into, economic, snags, around, 1970, and, experienced, significant, unemployment, and, inflation, declassified, documents, from, the, cia, state, in, 1967, it, was, already, clear, that, although, tito, s, economic, model, had, achieved, growth, of, the, gross, national, product, around, 7, it, also, created, frequently, unwise, industrial, investment, and, a, chronic, deficit, in, the, nation, s, balance, of, payment, in, the, 1970s, uncontrolled, growth, often, created, chronic, inflation, which, tito, and, the, party, could, not, fully, stabilise, or, moderate, yugoslavia, also, paid, high, interest, on, loans, compared, to, the, libor, rate, but, tito, s, presence, eased, investors, fears, since, he, had, proven, willing, and, able, to, implement, unpopular, reforms, by, 1979, with, tito, s, passing, on, the, horizon, a, global, downturn, in, the, economy, consistently, increasing, unemployment, and, growth, slowing, to, 5, 9, throughout, the, 1970s, it, had, become, likely, that, the, rapid, economic, growth, to, which, the, yugoslavs, become, accustomed, would, aggressively, decline, with, the, passing, of, the, 1974, yugoslav, constitution, tito, initiated, what, according, to, a, ross, johnson, of, the, united, states, department, of, state, constituted, the, first, effort, in, postwar, yugoslavia, and, the, first, attempt, in, any, communist, system, to, establish, depersonalised, and, institutionalised, rules, of, the, game, in, party, decision, making, bodies, intended, to, apply, to, the, period, of, succession, this, system, created, a, state, and, party, presidency, that, was, governed, collectively, each, limited, to, one, year, term, of, office, but, this, system, might, have, contributed, to, the, collapse, of, yugoslavia, according, to, professor, robert, m, hayden, while, perhaps, no, federal, structure, could, have, contained, the, political, pressures, of, yugoslavia, in, 1989, 91, the, flaws, of, the, 1974, constitution, served, to, ensure, that, they, became, unmanageable, thus, making, civil, war, virtually, inevitable, responsibility, for, the, war, must, thus, be, shared, between, the, slovenes, whose, actions, destroyed, the, federal, structure, milo, evi, whose, aggressive, politics, goaded, the, slovenes, into, doing, so, and, the, drafters, of, the, constitution, who, made, the, chimaera, of, a, confederation, seem, a, reasonable, constitutional, structure, tito, is, credited, with, transforming, yugoslavia, from, a, poor, nation, to, a, middle, income, one, that, saw, vast, improvements, in, women, s, rights, health, education, urbanisation, industrialisation, and, many, other, areas, of, human, and, economic, development, a, 2010, poll, found, that, as, many, as, 81, of, serbians, believe, that, life, was, better, under, tito, tito, also, ranked, first, in, the, greatest, croatian, poll, which, was, conducted, in, 2003, by, the, croatian, weekly, news, magazine, nacional, during, his, life, and, especially, in, the, first, year, after, his, death, several, places, were, named, after, tito, several, of, these, have, since, returned, to, their, original, names, for, example, podgorica, formerly, titograd, though, podgorica, s, international, airport, is, still, identified, by, the, code, tgd, and, u, ice, formerly, known, as, titovo, u, ice, which, reverted, to, its, original, name, in, 1992, streets, in, belgrade, the, capital, have, all, reverted, to, their, original, pre, world, war, ii, and, pre, communist, names, as, well, in, 2004, antun, augustin, i, s, statue, of, broz, in, his, birthplace, of, kumrovec, was, decapitated, in, an, explosion, it, was, subsequently, repaired, twice, in, 2008, protests, took, place, in, what, was, then, zagreb, s, marshal, tito, square, since, 2017, the, republic, of, croatia, square, organised, by, a, group, called, circle, for, the, square, krug, za, trg, with, an, aim, to, force, the, city, government, to, rename, it, to, its, previous, name, while, a, counter, protest, by,

stjepan, mesi, criticised, the, demonstration, to, change, the, name, in, the, croatian, coastal, city, of, opatija, the, main, street, also, its, longest, street, still, bears, the, name, of, marshal, tito, rijeka, third, largest, city, in, croatia, also, refuses, to, change, the, name, of, one, of, the, squares, in, the, city, centre, named, after, tito, there, are, streets, named, after, tito, in, numerous, towns, in, serbia, mostly, in, the, country, s, north, vojvodina, one, of, the, main, streets, in, downtown, sarajevo, is, called, marshal, tito, street, and, tito, s, statue, in, a, park, in, front, of, the, university, campus, ex, jna, barrack, mar, al, tito, in, marijin, dvor, is, a, place, where, bosnians, and, sarajevans, still, today, commemorate, and, pay, tribute, to,

asteroid, 1550, tito, discovered, by, serbian, astronomer, milorad, b, proti, at, belgrade, observatory, in, 1937, was, named, in, his, honour, the, croat, historian, marijana, belaj, wrote, that, for, some, people, in, croatia, and, other, parts, of, the, former, yugoslavia, tito, is, remembered, as, a, sort, of, secular, saint, mentioning, how, some, croats, keep, portraits, of, catholic, saints, together, with, a, portrait, of, tito, on, their, walls, as, a, way, to, bring, hope, the, practice, of, writing, letters, to, tito, has, continued, well, after, his, death, with, several, websites, in, former, yugoslavia, devoted, entirely, as, forums, for, people, to, send, him, posthumous, letters, in, which, they, often, write, about, personal, problems, every, year, on, 25, may, several, thousand, people, from, the, former, yugoslavia, gather, in, tito, s, hometown, of, kumrovec, and, his, resting, place, house, of, flowers, to, pay, tribute, to, his, memory, and, celebrate, the, former, country, s, youth, day, which, in, the, yugoslav, era, was, one, of, the, biggest, annual, celebrations, and, was, marked, by, the, relay, of, youth, with, a, birthday, pledge, to, tito, belaj, wrote, that, much, of, the, tito, cult, s, posthumous, appeal, centres, around, tito, s, everyman, persona, and, his, image, as, a, friend, to, ordinary, people, in, contrast, to, the, way, in, which, stalin, was, depicted, in, his, cult, of, personality, as, a, cold, aloof, godlike, figure, whose, extraordinary, qualities, set, him, apart, from, ordinary, people, most, of, those, who, come, to, kumrovec, on, 25, may, to, kiss, tito, s, statue, are, women, belaji, wrote, that, the, tito, cult, s, appeal, today, owes, less, to, communism, observing, that, most, people, who, come, to, kumrovec, do, not, believe, in, communism, than, to, nostalgia, for, tito, s, yugoslavia, and, affection, for, an, ordinary, man, who, became, great, tito, was, not, a, croat, nationalist, but, the, fact, that, tito, became, the, world, s, most, famous, croat, serving, as, the, leader, of, the, non, aligned, movement, and, being, seen, as, an, important, world, leader, inspires, pride, in, certain, quarters, of, croatia, every, year, a, brotherhood, and, unity, relay, race, is, organised, in, montenegro, north, macedonia, and, serbia, that, ends, on, 25, may, at, the, house, of,
