one, of, kutscher, s, drama, seminars, initiating, a, trend, that, persisted, throughout, his, career, of, creative, activity, that, was, generated, by, a, desire, to, counter, another, work, both,

time, a, new, tone, a, new, melody, a, new, vision, it, is, a, language, you, can, feel, on, your, tongue, in, your, gums, your, ear, your, spinal, column, in, november, it, was, announced, that, brecht, had, been, awarded, the, prestigious, kleist, prize, intended, for, unestablished, writers, and, probably, germany, s, most, significant, literary, award, until, it, was, abolished, in, 1932, for, his, first, three, plays, baal, drums, in, the, night, and, in, the, jungle, although, at, that, point, only, drums, had, been, produced, the, citation, for, the, award, insisted, that, language, is, vivid, without, being, deliberately, poetic, symbolical, without, being, over, literary, brecht, is, a, dramatist, because, his, language, is, felt, physically, and, in, the, round, that, year,

was, to, become, a, short, slapstick, film, mysteries, of, a, barbershop, directed, by, erich, engel, and, starring, karl, valentin, despite, a, lack, of, success, at, the, time, its, experimental, inventiveness, and, the, subsequent, success, of, many, of, its, contributors, have, meant, that, it, is, now, considered, one, of, the, most, important, films, in, german, film, history, in, may, of, that, year, brecht, s, in, the, jungle, premiered, in, munich, also, directed, by, engel, opening, night, proved, to, be, a, scandal, a, phenomenon, that, would, characterize, many, of, his, later, productions, during, the, weimar, republic, in, which, nazis, blew, whistles, and, threw, stink, bombs, at, the, actors, on, the, stage, in, 1924, brecht, worked, with, the, novelist, and, playwright, lion, feuchtwanger, whom, he, had, met, in, 1919, on, an, adaptation, of, christopher, marlowe, s, edward, ii, that, proved, to, be, a, milestone, in, brecht, s, early, theatrical, and, dramaturgical, development, brecht, s, edward, ii, constituted, his, first, attempt, at, collaborative, writing, and, was, the, first, of, many, classic, texts, he, was, to, adapt, as, his, first, solo, directorial, d, but, he, later, credited, it, as, the, germ, of, his, conception, of, epic, theatre, that, september, a, job, as, assistant, dramaturg, at, max, reinhardt, s, deutsches, theater, at, the, time, one, of, the, leading, three, or, four, theatres, in, the, world, brought, him, to, berlin, in, 1923, brecht, s, marriage, to, zoff, began, to, break, down, though, they, did, not, divorce, until, 1927, brecht, had, become, involved, with, both, elisabeth, hauptmann, and, helene, weigel, brecht, and, weigel, s, son, stefan, was, born, in, october, 1924, in, his, role, as, dramaturg, brecht, had, much, to, stimulate, him, but, little, work, of, his, own, reinhardt, staged, shaw, s, saint, joan, goldoni, s, servant, of, two, masters, with, the, improvisational, approach, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, in, which, the, actors, chatted, with, the, prompter, about, their, roles, and, pirandello, s, six, characters, in, search, of, an, author, in, his, group, of, berlin, theatres, a, new, version, of, brecht, s, third, play, now, entitled, jungle, decline, of, a, family, opened, at, the, deutsches, theater, in, october, 1924, but, was, not, a, success, in, the, asphalt, city, i, m, at, home, from, the, very, start, provided, with, every, last, sacrament, with, newspapers, and, tobacco, and, brandy, to, the, end, mistrustful, lazy, and, content, bertolt, brecht, of, poor, bb, at, this, time, brecht, revised, his, important, transitional, poem, of, poor, bb, in, 1925, his, publishers, provided, him, with, elisabeth, hauptmann, as, an, assistant, for, the, completion, of, his, collection, of, poems, devotions, for, the, home, hauspostille, eventually, published, in, january, 1927, she, continued, to, work, with, him, after, the, publisher, s, commission, ran, out, in, 1925, in, mannheim, the, artistic, exhibition, neue, sachlichkeit, new, objectivity, had, given, its, name, to, the, new, post, expressionist, movement, in, the, german, arts, with, little, to, do, at, the, deutsches, theater, brecht, began, to, develop, his, man, equals, man, project, which, was, to, become, the, first, product, of, the, brecht, collective, that, shifting, group, of, friends, and, collaborators, on, whom, he, henceforward, depended, this, collaborative, approach, to, artistic, production, together, with, aspects, of, brecht, s, writing, and, style, of, theatrical, production, mark, brecht, s, work, from, this, period, as, part, of, the, neue, sachlichkeit, movement, the, collective, s, work, mirrored, the, artistic, climate, of, the, middle, 1920s, willett, and, manheim, argue, with, their, attitude, of, neue, sachlichkeit, or, new, matter, of, factness, their, stressing, of, the, collectivity, and, downplaying, of, the, individual, and, their, new, cult, of, anglo, saxon, imagery, and, sport, together, the, collective, would, go, to, fights, not, only, absorbing, their, terminology, and, ethos, which, permeates, man, equals, man, but, also, drawing, those, conclusions, for, the, theatre, as, a, whole, which, brecht, set, down, in, his, theoretical, essay, emphasis, on, sport, and, tried, to, realise, by, means, of, the, harsh, lighting, the, boxing, ring, stage, and, other, anti, illusionistic, devices, that, henceforward, appeared, in, his, own, productions, in, 1925, brecht, also, saw, two, films, that, had, a, significant, influence, on, him, chaplin, s, the, gold, rush, and, eisenstein, s, battleship, potemkin, brecht, had, compared, valentin, to, chaplin, and, the, two, of, them, provided, models, for, galy, gay, in, man, equals, man, brecht, later, wrote, that, chaplin, would, in, many, ways, come, closer, to, the, epic, than, to, the, dramatic, theatre, s, requirements, they, met, several, times, during, brecht, s, time, in, the, united, states, and, discussed, chaplin, s, monsieur, verdoux, project, which, it, is, possible, brecht, influenced, in, 1926, a, series, of, short, stories, was, published, under, brecht, s, name, though, hauptmann, was, closely, associated, with, writing, them, following, the, production, of, man, equals, man, in, darmstadt, that, year, brecht, began, studying, marxism, and, socialism, in, earnest, under, the, supervision, of, hauptmann, when, i, read, marx, s, capital, a, note, by, brecht, reveals, i, understood, my, plays, marx, was, it, continues, the, only, spectator, for, my, plays, i, d, ever, come, across, inspired, by, the, developments, in, ussr, brecht, wrote, a, number, of, agitprop, plays, praising, the, bolshevik, collectivism, replaceability, of, each, member, of, the, collective, in, man, equals, man, and, the, red, terror, the, decision, for, us, man, portrayed, on, the, stage, is, significant, as, a, social, function, it, is, not, his, relationship, to, himself, nor, his, relationship, to, god, but, his, relationship, to, society, which, is, central, whenever, he, appears, his, class, or, social, stratum, appears, with, him, his, moral, spiritual, or, sexual, conflicts, are, conflicts, with, society, erwin, piscator, 1929, in, 1927, brecht, became, part, of, the, dramaturgical, collective, of, erwin, piscator, s, first, company, which, was, designed, to, tackle, the, problem, of, finding, new, plays, for, its, epic, political, confrontational, documentary, theatre, brecht, collaborated, with, piscator, during, the, period, of, the, latter, s, landmark, productions, hoppla, we, re, alive, by, toller, rasputin, the, adventures, of, the, good, soldier, schweik, and, konjunktur, by, lania, brecht, s, most, significant, contribution, was, to, the, adaptation, of, the, unfinished, episodic, comic, novel, schweik, which, he, later, described, as, a, montage, from, the, novel, the, piscator, productions, influenced, brecht, s, ideas, about, staging, and, design, and, alerted, him, to, the, radical, potentials, offered, to, the, epic, playwright, by, the, development, of, stage, technology, particularly, projections, what, brecht, took, from, piscator, is, fairly, plain, and, he, acknowledged, it, willett, suggests, the, emphasis, on, reason, and, didacticism, the, sense, that, the, new, subject, matter, demanded, a, new, dramatic, form, the, use, of, songs, to, interrupt, and, comment, all, these, are, found, in, his, notes, and, essays, of, the, 1920s, and, he, bolstered, them, by, citing, such, piscatorial, examples, as, the, step, by, step, narrative, technique, of, schweik, and, the, oil, interests, handled, in, konjunktur, petroleum, resists, the, five, act, form, brecht, was, struggling, at, the, time, with, the, question, of, how, to, dramatize, the, complex, economic, relationships, of, modern, capitalism, in, his, unfinished, project, joe, p, fleischhacker, which, piscator, s, theatre, announced, in, its, programme, for, the, 1927, 28, season, it, wasn, t, until, his, saint, joan, of, the, stockyards, written, between, 1929, and, 1931, that, brecht, solved, it, in, 1928, he, discussed, with, piscator, plans, to, stage, shakespeare, s, julius, caesar, and, brecht, s, own, drums, in, the, night, but, the, productions, did, not, materialize, the, year, 1927, also, saw, the, first, collaboration, between, brecht, and, the, young, composer, kurt, weill, together, they, began, to, develop, brecht, s, mahagonny, project, along, thematic, lines, of, the, biblical, cities, of, the, plain, but, rendered, in, terms, of, the, neue, sachlichkeit, s, amerikanismus, which, had, informed, brecht, s, previous, work, they, produced, the, little, mahagonny, for, a, music, festival, in, july, as, what, weill, called, a, stylistic, exercise, in, preparation, for, the, large, scale, piece, from, that, point, on, caspar, neher, became, an, integral, part, of, the, collaborative, effort, with, words, music, and, visuals, conceived, in, relation, to, one, another, from, the, start, the, model, for, their, mutual, articulation, lay, in, brecht, s, newly, formulated, principle, of, the, separation, of, the, elements, which, he, first, outlined, in, the, modern, theatre, is, the, epic, theatre, 1930, the, principle, a, variety, of, montage, proposed, by, passing, the, great, struggle, for, supremacy, between, words, music, and, production, as, brecht, put, it, by, showing, each, as, self, contained, independent, works, of, art, that, adopt, attitudes, towards, one, another, in, 1930, brecht, married, weigel, their, daughter, barbara, brecht, was, born, soon, after, the, wedding, she, also, became, an, actress, and, would, later, share, the, copyrights, of, brecht, s, work, with, her, siblings, brecht, formed, a, writing, collective, which, became, prolific, and, very, influential, elisabeth, hauptmann, margarete, steffin, emil, burri, ruth, berlau, and, others, worked, with, brecht, and, produced, the, multiple, teaching, plays, which, attempted, to, create, a, new, dramaturgy, for, participants, rather, than, passive, audiences, these, addressed, themselves, to, the, massive, worker, arts, organisation, that, existed, in, germany, and, austria, in, the, 1920s, so, did, brecht, s, first, great, play, saint, joan, of, the, stockyards, which, attempts, to, portray, the, drama, in, financial, transactions, this, collective, adapted, john, gay, s, the, beggar, s, opera, with, brecht, s, lyrics, set, to, music, by, kurt, weill, retitled, the, threepenny, opera, die, dreigroschenoper, it, was, the, biggest, hit, in, berlin, of, the, 1920s, and, a, renewing, influence, on, the, musical, worldwide, one, of, its, most, famous, lines, underscored, the, hypocrisy, of, conventional, morality, imposed, by, the, church, working, in, conjunction, with, the, established, order, in, the, face, of, working, class, hunger, and, deprivation, erst, kommt, das, fressen, dann, kommt, die, moral, first, the, grub, lit, eating, like, animals, gorging, then, the, morality, the, success, of, the, threepenny, opera, was, followed, by, the, quickly, thrown, together, happy, end, it, was, a, personal, and, a, commercial, failure, at, the, time, the, book, was, purported, to, be, by, the, mysterious, dorothy, lane, now, known, to, be, elisabeth, hauptmann, brecht, s, secretary, and, close, collaborator, brecht, only, claimed, authorship, of, the, song, texts, brecht, would, later, use, elements, of, happy, end, as, the, germ, for, his, saint, joan, of, the, stockyards, a, play, that, would, never, see, the, stage, in, brecht, s, lifetime, happy, end, s, score, by, weill, produced, many, brecht, weill, hits, like, der, bilbao,

wry, jokes, throughout, the, proceedings, punctuating, his, inability, to, speak, english, well, with, continuous, references, to, the, translators, present, who, transformed, his, german, statements, into, english, ones, unintelligible, to, himself, huac, vice, chairman, karl, mundt, thanked, brecht, for, his, co, operation, the, remaining, witnesses, the, so, called, hollywood, ten, refused, to, testify, and, were, cited, for, contempt, brecht, s, decision, to, appear, before, the, committee, led, to, criticism, including, accusations, of, betrayal, the, day, after, his, testimony, on, 31, october, brecht, returned, to, europe, he, lived, in, zurich, in, switzerland, for, a, year, in, february, 1948, in, chur, brecht, staged, an, adaptation, of, sophocles, antigone, based, on, a, translation, by, h, lderlin, it, was, published, under, the, title, antigonemodell, 1948, accompanied, by, an, essay, on, the, importance, of, creating, a, non, aristotelian, form, of, theatre, in, 1949, he, moved, to, east, berlin, and, established, his, theatre, company, there, the, berliner, ensemble, he, retained, austrian, nationality, which, was, granted, in, 1950, and, overseas, bank, accounts, from, which, he, received, valuable, hard, currency, remittances, the, copyrights, on, his, writings, were, held, by, a, swiss, company, though, he, was, never, a, member, of, the, communist, party, brecht, had, been, schooled, in, marxism, by, the, dissident, communist, karl, korsch, korsch, s, version, of, the, marxist, dialectic, influenced, brecht, greatly, both, his, aesthetic, theory, and, theatrical, practice, brecht, received, the, stalin, peace, prize, in, 1954, his, proximity, to, marxist, thought, made, him, controversial, in, austria, where, his, plays, were, boycotted, by, directors, and, not, performed, for, more, than, ten, years, brecht, wrote, very, few, plays, in, his, final, years, in, east, berlin, none, of, them, as, famous, as, his, previous, works, he, dedicated, himself, to, directing, plays, and, developing, the, talents, of, the, next, generation, of, young, directors, and, dramaturgs, such, as, manfred, wekwerth, benno, besson, and, carl, weber, at, this, time, he, wrote, some, of, his, most, famous, poems, including, the, buckow, elegies, at, first, brecht, apparently, supported, the, measures, taken, by, the, east, german, government, against, the, east, german, uprising, of, 1953, which, included, the, use, of, soviet, military, force, in, a, letter, from, the, day, of, the, uprising, to, sed, first, secretary, walter, ulbricht, brecht, wrote, that, history, will, pay, its, respects, to, the, revolutionary, impatience, of, the, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, the, great, discussion, with, the, masses, about, the, speed, of, socialist, construction, will, lead, to, a, viewing, and, safeguarding, of, the, socialist, achievements, at, this, moment, i, must, assure, you, of, my, allegiance, to, the, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, brecht, s, subsequent, commentary, on, those, events, however, offered, a, very, different, assessment, in, one, of, the, poems, in, the, elegies, die, l, sung, the, solution, a, disillusioned, brecht, writes, a, few, months, later, after, the, uprising, of, the, 17th, of, june, the, secretary, of, the, writers, union, had, leaflets, distributed, in, the, stalinallee, stating, that, the, people, had, forfeited, the, confidence, of, the, government, and, could, win, it, back, only, by, increased, work, quotas, would, it, not, be, easier, in, that, case, for, the, government, to, dissolve, the, people, and, elect, another, brecht, s, involvement, in, agitprop, and, lack, of, clear, condemnation, of, purges, resulted, in, criticism, from, many, contemporaries, who, became, disillusioned, with, communism, earlier, fritz, raddatz, who, knew, brecht, for, a, long, time, described, his, attitude, as, broken, escaping, the, problem, of, stalinism, ignoring, his, friends, being, murdered, in, the, ussr, keeping, silence, during, show, trials, such, as, the, sl, nsk, trial, after, khrushchev, s, secret, speech, the, report, read, on, the, 20th, congress, of, the, cpsu, which, brought, the, crimes, of, stalinism, to, the, public, brecht, wrote, poems, critical, of, stalin, and, his, cult, unpublished, during, brecht, s, lifetime, in, the, best, known, of, them, the, tsar, spoke, to, them, der, zar, hat, mit, ihnen, gesprochen, brecht, mocked, the, epithets, applied, to, stalin, as, the, honoured, murderer, of, the, people, and, compared, his, state, terror, policies, with, the, ones, of, the, russian, tsar, nicholas, ii, famous, for, violent, suppression, of, a, peaceful, demonstration, on, bloody, sunday, and, later, protests, which, resulted, in, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, the, sun, of, the, peoples, burned, its, worshippers, when, young, he, was, conscientious, when, old, he, was, cruel, young, he, was, not, god, who, becomes, god, becomes, dumb, brecht, died, on, 14, august, 1956, of, a, heart, attack, at, the, age, of, 58, he, is, buried, in, the, dorotheenstadt, cemetery, on, chausseestra, e, in, the, mitte, neighbourhood, of, berlin, overlooked, by, the, residence, he, shared, with, helene, weigel, according, to, stephen, parker, who, reviewed, brecht, s, writings, and, unpublished, medical, records, brecht, contracted, rheumatic, fever, as, a, child, which, led, to, an, enlarged, heart, followed, by, life, long, chronic, heart, failure, and, sydenham, s, chorea, a, report, of, a, radiograph, taken, of, brecht, in, 1951, describes, a, badly, diseased, heart, enlarged, to, the, left, with, a, protruding, aortic, knob, and, with, seriously, impaired, pumping, brecht, s, colleagues, described, him, as, being, very, nervous, and, sometimes, shaking, his, head, or, moving, his, hands, erratically, this, can, be, reasonably, attributed, to, sydenham, s, chorea, which, is, also, associated, with, emotional, lability, personality, changes, obsessive, compulsive, behavior, and, hyperactivity, which, matched, brecht, s, behavior, what, is, remarkable, wrote, parker, is, his, capacity, to, turn, abject, physical, weakness, into, peerless, artistic, strength, arrhythmia, into, the, rhythms, of, poetry, chorea, into, the, choreography, of, drama, brecht, developed, the, combined, theory, and, practice, of, his, epic, theatre, by, synthesizing, and, extending, the, experiments, of, erwin, piscator, and, vsevolod, meyerhold, to, explore, the, theatre, as, a, forum, for, political, ideas, and, the, creation, of, a, critical, aesthetics, of, dialectical, materialism, epic, theatre, proposed, that, a, play, should, not, cause, the, spectator, to, identify, emotionally, with, the, characters, or, action, before, him, or, her, but, should, instead, provoke, rational, self, reflection, and, a, critical, view, of, the, action, on, the, stage, brecht, thought, that, the, experience, of, a, climactic, catharsis, of, emotion, left, an, audience, complacent, instead, he, wanted, his, audiences, to, adopt, a, critical, perspective, in, order, to, recognize, social, injustice, and, exploitation, and, to, be, moved, to, go, forth, from, the, theatre, and, effect, change, in, the, world, outside, for, this, purpose, brecht, employed, the, use, of, techniques, that, remind, the, spectator, that, the, play, is, a, representation, of, reality, and, not, reality, itself, by, highlighting, the, constructed, nature, of, the, theatrical, event, brecht, hoped, to, communicate, that, the, audience, s, reality, was, equally, constructed, and, as, such, was, changeable, brecht, s, modernist, concern, with, drama, as, a, medium, led, to, his, refinement, of, the, epic, form, of, the, drama, this, dramatic, form, is, related, to, similar, modernist, innovations, in, other, arts, including, the, strategy, of, divergent, chapters, in, james, joyce, s, novel, ulysses, sergei, eisenstein, s, evolution, of, a, constructivist, montage, in, the, cinema, and, picasso, s, introduction, of, cubist, collage, in, the, visual, arts, one, of, brecht, s, most, important, principles, was, what, he, called, the, verfremdungseffekt, translated, as, defamiliarization, effect, distancing, effect, or, estrangement, effect, and, often, mistranslated, as, alienation, effect, this, involved, brecht, wrote, stripping, the, event, of, its, self, evident, familiar, obvious, quality, and, creating, a, sense, of, astonishment, and, curiosity, about, them, to, this, end, brecht, employed, techniques, such, as, the, actor, s, direct, address, to, the, audience, harsh, and, bright, stage, lighting, the, use, of, songs, to, interrupt, the, action, explanatory, placards, the, transposition, of, text, to, the, third, person, or, past, tense, in, rehearsals, and, speaking, the, stage, directions, out, loud, in, contrast, to, many, other, avant, garde, approaches, however, brecht, had, no, desire, to, destroy, art, as, an, institution, rather, he, hoped, to, re, function, the, theatre, to, a, new, social, use, in, this, regard, he, was, a, vital, participant, in, the, aesthetic, debates, of, his, era, particularly, over, the, high, art, popular, culture, dichotomy, vying, with, the, likes, of, theodor, w, adorno, gy, rgy, luk, cs, ernst, bloch, and, developing, a, close, friendship, with, walter, benjamin, brechtian, theatre, articulated, popular, themes, and, forms, with, avant, garde, formal, experimentation, to, create, a, modernist, realism, that, stood, in, sharp, contrast, both, to, its, psychological, and, socialist, varieties, brecht, s, work, is, the, most, important, and, original, in, european, drama, since, ibsen, and, strindberg, raymond, williams, argues, while, peter, b, rger, dubs, him, the, most, important, materialist, writer, of, our, time, brecht, was, also, influenced, by, chinese, theatre, and, used, its, aesthetic, as, an, argument, for, verfremdungseffekt, brecht, believed, traditional, chinese, acting, also, knows, the, alienation, effect, and, applies, it, most, subtly, the, performer, portrays, incidents, of, utmost, passion, but, without, his, delivery, becoming, heated, brecht, attended, a, chinese, opera, performance, and, was, introduced, to, the, famous, chinese, opera, performer, mei, lanfang, in, 1935, however, brecht, was, sure, to, distinguish, between, epic, and, chinese, theatre, he, recognized, that, the, chinese, style, was, not, a, transportable, piece, of, technique, and, that, epic, theatre, sought, to, historicize, and, address, social, and, political, issues, brecht, used, his, poetry, to, criticize, european, culture, including, nazis, and, the, german, bourgeoisie, brecht, s, poetry, is, marked, by, the, effects, of, the, first, and, second, world, wars, throughout, his, theatric, production, poems, are, incorporated, into, his, plays, with, music, in, 1951, brecht, issued, a, recantation, of, his, apparent, suppression, of, poetry, in, his, plays, with, a, note, titled, on, poetry, and, virtuosity, he, writes, we, shall, not, need, to, speak, of, a, play, s, poetry, something, that, seemed, relatively, unimportant, in, the, immediate, past, it, seemed, not, only, unimportant, but, misleading, and, the, reason, was, not, that, the, poetic, element, had, been, sufficiently, developed, and, observed, but, that, reality, had, been, tampered, with, in, its, name, we, had, to, speak, of, a, truth, as, distinct, from, poetry, we, have, given, up, examining, works, of, art, from, their, poetic, or, artistic, aspect, and, got, satisfaction, from, theatrical, works, that, have, no, sort, of, poetic, appeal, such, works, and, performances, may, have, some, effect, but, it, can, hardly, be, a, profound, one, not, even, politically, for, it, is, a, peculiarity, of, the, theatrical, medium, that, it, communicates, awarenesses, and, impulses, in, the, form, of, pleasure, the, depth, of, the, pleasure, and, the, impulse, will, correspond, to, the, depth, of, the, pleasure, brecht, s, most, influential, poetry, is, featured, in, his, manual, of, piety, devotions, establishing, him, as, a, noted, poet, bertolt, brecht, s, theories, had, a, major, influence, on, radical, cinema, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, jean, luc, godard, alexandre, kluge, rainer, werner, fassbinder, nagisa, shima, and, jean, marie, straub, and, danielle, huillet, are, often, cited, as, the, major, exponents, of, brechtian, cinema, brecht, s, widow, the, actress, helene, weigel, continued, to, manage, the, berliner, ensemble, until, her, death, in, 1971, it, was, primarily, devoted, to, performing, brecht, s, plays, besides, being, an, influential, dramatist, and, poet, some, scholars, have, stressed, the, significance, of, brecht, s, original, contributions, in, political, and, social, philosophy, brecht, s, collaborations, with, kurt, weill, have, had, some, influence, in, rock, music, the, alabama, song, for, example, originally, published, as, a, poem, in, brecht, s, hauspostille, 1927, and, set, to, music, by, weill, in, mahagonny, has, been, recorded, by, the, doors, on, their, self, titled, debut, album, as, well, as, by, david, bowie, and, various, other, bands, and, performers, since, the, 1960s, brecht, s, son, stefan, brecht, became, a, poet, and, theatre, critic, interested, in, new, york, s, avant, garde, theatre, brecht, s, plays, were, a, focus, of, the, schauspiel, frankfurt, when, harry, buckwitz, was, general, manager, including, the, world, premiere, of, die, gesichte, der, simone, machard, in, 1957, collective, and, collaborative, working, methods, were, inherent, to, brecht, s, approach, as, fredric, jameson, among, others, stresses, jameson, describes, the, creator, of, the, work, not, as, brecht, the, individual, but, rather, as, brecht, a, collective, subject, that, certainly, seemed, to, have, a, distinctive, style, the, one, we, now, call, brechtian, but, was, no, longer, personal, in, the, bourgeois, or, individualistic, sense, during, the, course, of, his, career, brecht, sustained, many, long, lasting, creative, relationships, with, other, writers, composers, scenographers, directors, dramaturgs, and, actors, the, list, includes, elisabeth, hauptmann, margarete, steffin, ruth, berlau, slatan, dudow, kurt, weill, hanns, eisler, paul, dessau, caspar, neher, teo, otto, karl, von, appen, ernst, busch, lotte, lenya, peter, lorre, therese, giehse, angelika, hurwicz, carola, neher, and, helene, weigel, herself, this, is, theatre, as, collective, experiment, as, something, radically, different, from, theatre, as, expression, or, as, experience, entries, show, english, language, translation, of, title, german, language, title, brecht, wrote, hundreds, of, poems, throughout, his, life, he, began, writing, poetry, as, a, young, boy, and, his, first, poems, were, published, in, 1914, his, poetry, was, influenced, by, folk, ballads, french, chansons, and, the, poetry, of, rimbaud, and, villon, the, last, collection, of, new, poetry, by, brecht, published, in, his, lifetime, was, the, 1939, svendborger, gedichte, some, of, brecht, s, poems
