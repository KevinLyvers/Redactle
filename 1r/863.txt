leon, festinger, 8, may, 1919, 11, february, 1989, was, an, american, social, psychologist, who, originated, the, theory, of, cognitive, dissonance, and, social, comparison, theory, the, rejection, of, the, previously, dominant, behaviorist, view, of, social, psychology, by, demonstrating, the, inadequacy, of, stimulus, response, conditioning, accounts, of, human, behavior, is, largely, attributed, to, his, theories, and, research, festinger, is, also, credited, with, advancing, the, use, of, laboratory, experimentation, in, social, psychology, although, he, simultaneously, stressed, the, importance, of, studying, real, life, situations, a, principle, he, practiced, when, personally, infiltrating, a, doomsday, cult, he, is, also, known, in, social, network, theory, for, the, proximity, effect, or, propinquity, festinger, studied, psychology, under, kurt, lewin, an, important, figure, in, modern, social, psychology, at, the, university, of, iowa, graduating, in, 1941, however, he, did, not, develop, an, interest, in, social, psychology, until, after, joining, the, faculty, at, lewin, s, research, center, for, group, dynamics, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, in, 1945, despite, his, preeminence, in, social, psychology, festinger, turned, to, visual, perception, research, in, 1964, and, then, archaeology, history, and, the, human, evolutionary, sciences, in, 1979, until, his, death, in, 1989, following, b, f, skinner, jean, piaget, sigmund, freud, and, albert, bandura, festinger, was, the, fifth, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, festinger, was, born, in, brooklyn, new, york, on, may, 8, 1919, to, russian, jewish, immigrants, alex, festinger, and, sara, solomon, festinger, his, father, an, embroidery, manufacturer, had, left, russia, a, radical, and, atheist, and, remained, faithful, to, these, views, throughout, his, life, festinger, attended, boys, high, school, in, brooklyn, and, received, his, bs, degree, in, psychology, from, the, city, college, of, new, york, in, 1939, he, proceeded, to, study, under, kurt, lewin, at, the, university, of, iowa, where, festinger, received, his, ma, in, 1940, and, phd, in, 1942, in, the, field, of, child, behavior, by, his, own, admission, he, was, not, interested, in, social, psychology, when, he, arrived, at, iowa, and, did, not, take, a, single, course, in, social, psychology, during, his, entire, time, there, instead, he, was, interested, in, lewin, s, earlier, work, on, tension, systems, but, lewin, s, focus, had, shifted, to, social, psychology, by, the, time, festinger, arrived, at, iowa, however, festinger, continued, to, pursue, his, original, interests, studying, level, of, aspiration, working, on, statistics, developing, a, quantitative, model, of, decision, making, and, even, publishing, a, laboratory, study, on, rats, explaining, his, lack, of, interest, in, social, psychology, at, the, time, festinger, stated, the, looser, methodology, of, the, social, psychology, studies, and, the, vagueness, of, relation, of, the, data, to, lewinian, concepts, and, theories, all, seemed, unappealing, to, me, in, my, youthful, penchant, for, rigor, festinger, considered, himself, to, be, a, freethinker, and, an, atheist, after, graduating, festinger, worked, as, a, research, associate, at, iowa, from, 1941, to, 1943, and, then, as, a, statistician, for, the, committee, on, selection, and, training, of, aircraft, pilots, at, the, university, of, rochester, from, 1943, to, 1945, during, world, war, ii, in, 1943, festinger, married, mary, oliver, ballou, a, pianist, with, whom, he, had, three, children, catherine, richard, and, kurt, festinger, and, ballou, were, later, divorced, and, festinger, married, trudy, bradley, currently, a, professor, of, social, work, emeritus, at, new, york, university, in, 1968, in, 1945, festinger, joined, lewin, s, newly, formed, research, center, for, group, dynamics, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, as, an, assistant, professor, it, was, at, mit, that, festinger, in, his, own, words, became, by, fiat, a, social, psychologist, and, immersed, myself, in, the, field, with, all, its, difficulties, vaguenesses, and, challenges, it, was, also, at, mit, that, festinger, began, his, foray, into, social, communication, and, pressures, in, groups, that, marked, a, turning, point, in, his, own, research, as, festinger, himself, recalls, the, years, at, m, i, t, seemed, to, us, all, to, be, momentous, ground, breaking, the, new, beginning, of, something, important, indeed, stanley, schachter, festinger, s, student, and, research, assistant, at, the, time, states, i, was, lucky, enough, to, work, with, festinger, at, this, time, and, i, think, of, it, as, one, of, the, high, points, of, my, scientific, life, yet, this, endeavor, started, as, almost, an, accident, while, festinger, was, conducting, a, study, on, the, impact, of, architectural, and, ecological, factors, on, student, housing, satisfaction, for, the, university, although, the, proximity, effect, or, propinquity, was, an, important, direct, finding, from, the, study, festinger, and, his, collaborators, also, noticed, correlations, between, the, degree, of, friendship, within, a, group, of, residents, and, the, similarity, of, opinions, within, the, group, thus, raising, unexpected, questions, regarding, communication, within, social, groups, and, the, development, of, group, standards, of, attitudes, and, behaviors, indeed, festinger, s, seminal, 1950, paper, on, informal, social, communication, as, a, function, of, pressures, toward, attitude, uniformity, within, a, group, cites, findings, from, this, seemingly, unrelated, housing, satisfaction, study, multiple, times, after, lewin, s, death, in, 1947, festinger, moved, with, the, research, center, to, the, university, of, michigan, in, 1948, he, then, moved, to, the, university, of, minnesota, in, 1951, and, then, on, to, stanford, university, in, 1955, during, this, time, festinger, published, his, highly, influential, paper, on, social, comparison, theory, extending, his, prior, theory, regarding, the, evaluation, of, attitudes, in, social, groups, to, the, evaluation, of, abilities, in, social, groups, following, this, in, 1957, festinger, published, his, theory, of, cognitive, dissonance, arguably, his, most, famous, and, influential, contribution, to, the, field, of, social, psychology, some, also, view, this, as, an, extension, of, festinger, s, prior, work, on, group, pressures, toward, resolving, discrepancies, in, attitudes, and, abilities, within, social, groups, to, how, the, individual, resolves, discrepancies, at, the, cognitive, level, festinger, also, received, considerable, recognition, during, this, time, for, his, work, both, from, within, the, field, being, awarded, the, distinguished, scientific, contribution, award, by, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1959, and, outside, of, the, field, being, named, as, one, of, america, s, ten, most, promising, scientists, by, fortune, magazine, shortly, after, publishing, social, comparison, theory, despite, such, recognition, festinger, left, the, field, of, social, psychology, in, 1964, attributing, his, decision, to, a, conviction, that, had, been, growing, in, me, at, the, time, that, i, personally, was, in, a, rut, and, needed, an, injection, of, intellectual, stimulation, from, new, sources, to, continue, to, be, productive, he, turned, his, attention, to, the, visual, system, focusing, on, human, eye, movement, and, color, perception, in, 1968, festinger, returned, to, his, native, new, york, city, continuing, his, perception, research, at, the, new, school, then, known, as, the, new, school, for, social, research, in, 1979, he, closed, his, laboratory, citing, dissatisfaction, with, working, on, narrower, and, narrower, technical, problems, writing, in, 1983, four, years, after, closing, his, laboratory, festinger, expressed, a, sense, of, disappointment, with, what, he, and, his, field, had, accomplished, festinger, subsequently, began, exploring, prehistoric, archaeological, data, meeting, with, stephen, jay, gould, to, discuss, ideas, and, visiting, archaeological, sites, to, investigate, primitive, toolmaking, firsthand, his, efforts, eventually, culminated, in, the, book, the, human, legacy, which, examined, how, humans, evolved, and, developed, complex, societies, although, seemingly, the, product, of, a, disillusioned, wholesale, abandonment, of, the, field, of, psychology, festinger, considered, this, research, as, a, return, to, the, fundamental, concerns, of, psychology, he, described, the, goal, of, his, new, research, interests, as, see, what, can, be, inferred, from, different, vantage, points, from, different, data, realms, about, the, nature, the, characteristics, of, this, species, we, call, human, and, felt, bemused, when, fellow, psychologists, asked, him, how, his, new, research, interests, were, related, to, psychology, festinger, s, next, and, final, enterprise, was, to, understand, why, an, idea, is, accepted, or, rejected, by, a, culture, and, he, decided, that, examining, why, new, technology, was, adopted, quickly, in, the, west, but, not, in, the, eastern, byzantine, empire, would, illuminate, the, issue, however, festinger, was, diagnosed, with, cancer, before, he, was, able, to, publish, this, material, he, decided, not, to, pursue, treatment, and, died, on, february, 11, 1989, festinger, stanley, schachter, and, kurt, back, examined, the, choice, of, friends, among, college, students, living, in, married, student, housing, at, mit, the, team, showed, that, the, formation, of, ties, was, predicted, by, propinquity, the, physical, proximity, between, where, students, lived, and, not, just, by, similar, tastes, or, beliefs, as, conventional, wisdom, assumed, in, other, words, people, simply, tend, to, befriend, their, neighbors, they, also, found, that, functional, distance, predicted, social, ties, as, well, for, example, in, a, two, storey, apartment, building, people, living, on, the, lower, floor, next, to, a, stairway, are, functionally, closer, to, upper, floor, residents, than, are, others, living, on, the, same, lower, floor, the, lower, floor, residents, near, the, stairs, are, more, likely, than, their, lower, floor, neighbors, to, befriend, those, living, on, the, upper, floor, festinger, and, his, collaborators, viewed, these, findings, as, evidence, that, friendships, often, develop, based, on, passive, contacts, e, g, brief, meetings, made, as, a, result, of, going, to, and, from, home, within, the, student, housing, community, and, that, such, passive, contacts, are, more, likely, to, occur, given, closer, physical, and, functional, distance, between, people, in, his, 1950, paper, festinger, postulated, that, one, of, the, major, pressures, to, communicate, arises, from, uniformity, within, a, group, which, in, turn, arises, from, two, sources, social, reality, and, group, locomotion, festinger, argued, that, people, depend, on, social, reality, to, determine, the, subjective, validity, of, their, attitudes, and, opinions, and, that, they, look, to, their, reference, group, to, establish, social, reality, an, opinion, or, attitude, is, therefore, valid, to, the, extent, that, it, is, similar, to, that, of, the, reference, group, he, further, argued, that, pressures, to, communicate, arise, when, discrepancies, in, opinions, or, attitudes, exist, among, members, of, a, group, and, laid, out, a, series, hypotheses, regarding, determinants, of, when, group, members, communicate, whom, they, communicate, with, and, how, recipients, of, communication, react, citing, existing, experimental, evidence, to, support, his, arguments, festinger, labeled, communications, arising, from, such, pressures, toward, uniformity, as, instrumental, communication, in, that, the, communication, is, not, an, end, in, itself, but, a, means, to, reduce, discrepancies, between, the, communicator, and, others, in, the, group, instrumental, communication, is, contrasted, with, consummatory, communication, where, communication, is, the, end, such, as, emotional, expression, festinger, s, influential, social, comparison, theory, 1954, can, be, viewed, as, an, extension, of, his, prior, theory, related, to, the, reliance, on, social, reality, for, evaluating, attitudes, and, opinions, to, the, realm, of, abilities, starting, with, the, premise, that, humans, have, an, innate, drive, to, accurately, evaluate, their, opinions, and, abilities, festinger, postulated, that, people, will, seek, to, evaluate, their, opinions, and, abilities, by, comparing, them, with, those, of, others, specifically, people, will, seek, out, others, who, are, close, to, one, s, own, opinions, and, abilities, for, comparison, because, accurate, comparisons, are, difficult, when, others, are, too, divergent, from, those, of, oneself, to, use, festinger, s, example, a, chess, novice, does, not, compare, his, chess, abilities, to, those, of, recognized, chess, masters, nor, does, a, college, student, compare, his, intellectual, abilities, to, those, of, a, toddler, people, will, moreover, take, action, to, reduce, discrepancies, in, attitudes, whether, by, changing, others, to, bring, them, closer, to, oneself, or, by, changing, one, s, own, attitudes, to, bring, them, closer, to, others, they, will, likewise, take, action, to, reduce, discrepancies, in, abilities, for, which, there, is, an, upward, drive, to, improve, one, s, abilities, thus, festinger, suggested, that, the, social, influence, processes, and, some, kinds, of, competitive, behavior, are, both, manifestations, of, the, same, socio, psychological, process, the, drive, for, self, evaluation, and, the, necessity, for, such, evaluation, being, based, on, comparison, with, other, persons, festinger, also, discussed, implications, of, social, comparison, theory, for, society, hypothesizing, that, the, tendency, for, people, to, move, into, groups, that, hold, opinions, which, agree, with, their, own, and, abilities, that, are, near, their, own, results, in, the, segmentation, of, society, into, groups, which, are, relatively, alike, in, his, 1954, paper, festinger, again, systematically, set, forth, a, series, of, hypotheses, corollaries, and, derivations, and, he, cited, existing, experimental, evidence, where, available, he, stated, his, main, set, of, hypotheses, as, follows, festinger, and, his, collaborators, henry, riecken, and, stanley, schachter, examined, conditions, under, which, disconfirmation, of, beliefs, leads, to, increased, conviction, in, such, beliefs, in, the, 1956, book, when, prophecy, fails, the, group, studied, a, small, apocalyptic, cult, led, by, dorothy, martin, under, the, pseudonym, marian, keech, in, the, book, a, suburban, housewife, martin, claimed, to, have, received, messages, from, the, guardians, a, group, of, superior, beings, from, another, planet, called, clarion, the, messages, purportedly, said, that, a, flood, spreading, to, form, an, inland, sea, stretching, from, the, arctic, circle, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, would, destroy, the, world, on, december, 21, 1954, the, three, psychologists, and, several, more, assistants, joined, the, group, the, team, observed, the, group, firsthand, for, months, before, and, after, the, predicted, apocalypse, many, of, the, group, members, quit, their, jobs, and, disposed, of, their, possessions, in, preparation, for, the, apocalypse, when, doomsday, came, and, went, martin, claimed, that, the, world, had, been, spared, because, of, the, force, of, good, and, light, that, the, group, members, had, spread, rather, than, abandoning, their, discredited, beliefs, group, members, adhered, to, them, even, more, strongly, and, began, proselytizing, with, fervor, festinger, and, his, co, authors, concluded, that, the, following, conditions, lead, to, increased, conviction, in, beliefs, following, disconfirmation, festinger, also, later, described, the, increased, conviction, and, proselytizing, by, cult, members, after, disconfirmation, as, a, specific, instantiation, of, cognitive, dissonance, i, e, increased, proselytizing, reduced, dissonance, by, producing, the, knowledge, that, others, also, accepted, their, beliefs, and, its, application, to, understanding, complex, mass, phenomena, the, observations, reported, in, when, prophecy, fails, were, the, first, experimental, evidence, for, belief, perseverance, festinger, s, seminal, 1957, work, integrated, existing, research, literature, on, influence, and, social, communication, under, his, theory, of, cognitive, dissonance, the, theory, was, motivated, by, a, study, of, rumors, immediately, following, a, severe, earthquake, in, india, in, 1934, among, people, who, felt, the, shock, but, sustained, no, damage, from, the, earthquake, rumors, were, widely, circulated, and, accepted, about, even, worse, disasters, to, come, although, seemingly, counter, intuitive, that, people, would, choose, to, believe, fear, provoking, rumors, festinger, reasoned, that, these, rumors, were, actually, fear, justifying, the, rumors, functioned, to, reduce, the, inconsistency, of, people, s, feelings, of, fear, despite, not, directly, experiencing, the, effects, of, the, earthquake, by, giving, people, a, reason, to, be, fearful, festinger, described, the, basic, hypotheses, of, cognitive, dissonance, as, follows, dissonance, reduction, can, be, achieved, by, changing, cognition, by, changing, actions, or, selectively, acquiring, new, information, or, opinions, to, use, festinger, s, example, of, a, smoker, who, has, knowledge, that, smoking, is, bad, for, his, health, the, smoker, may, reduce, dissonance, by, choosing, to, quit, smoking, by, changing, his, thoughts, about, the, effects, of, smoking, e, g, smoking, is, not, as, bad, for, your, health, as, others, claim, or, by, acquiring, knowledge, pointing, to, the, positive, effects, of, smoking, e, g, smoking, prevents, weight, gain, festinger, and, james, m, carlsmith, published, their, classic, cognitive, dissonance, experiment, in, 1959, in, the, experiment, subjects, were, asked, to, perform, an, hour, of, boring, and, monotonous, tasks, i, e, repeatedly, filling, and, emptying, a, tray, with, 12, spools, and, turning, 48, square, pegs, in, a, board, clockwise, some, subjects, who, were, led, to, believe, that, their, participation, in, the, experiment, had, concluded, were, then, asked, to, perform, a, favor, for, the, experimenter, by, telling, the, next, participant, who, was, actually, a, confederate, that, the, task, was, extremely, enjoyable, dissonance, was, created, for, the, subjects, performing, the, favor, as, the, task, was, in, fact, boring, half, of, the, paid, subjects, were, given, 1, for, the, favor, while, those, of, the, other, half, received, 20, as, predicted, by, festinger, and, carlsmith, those, paid, 1, reported, the, task, to, be, more, enjoyable, than, those, paid, 20, those, paid, 1, were, forced, to, reduce, dissonance, by, changing, their, opinions, of, the, task, to, produce, consonance, with, their, behavior, of, reporting, that, the, task, was, enjoyable, the, subjects, paid, 20, experienced, less, dissonance, as, the, large, payment, provided, consonance, with, their, behavior, they, therefore, rated, the, task, as, less, enjoyable, and, their, ratings, were, similar, to, those, who, were, not, asked, to, perform, the, dissonance, causing, favor, social, comparison, theory, and, cognitive, dissonance, have, been, described, by, other, psychologists, as, the, two, most, fruitful, theories, in, social, psychology, cognitive, dissonance, has, been, variously, described, as, social, psychology, s, most, notable, achievement, the, most, important, development, in, social, psychology, to, date, and, a, theory, without, which, social, psychology, would, not, be, what, it, is, today, cognitive, dissonance, spawned, decades, of, related, research, from, studies, focused, on, further, theoretical, refinement, and, development, to, domains, as, varied, as, decision, making, the, socialization, of, children, and, color, preference, in, addition, festinger, is, credited, with, the, ascendancy, of, laboratory, experimentation, in, social, psychology, as, one, who, converted, the, experiment, into, a, powerful, scientific, instrument, with, a, central, role, in, the, search, for, knowledge, an, obituary, published, by, the, american, psychologist, stated, that, it, was, doubtful, that, experimental, psychology, would, exist, at, all, without, festinger, yet, it, seems, that, festinger, was, wary, about, burdensome, demands, for, greater, empirical, precision, warning, against, the, dangers, of, such, demands, when, theoretical, concepts, are, not, yet, fully, developed, festinger, stated, research, can, increasingly, address, itself, to, minor, unclarities, in, prior, research, rather, than, to, larger, issues, people, can, lose, sight, of, the, basic, problems, because, the, field, becomes, defined, by, the, ongoing, research, he, also, stressed, that, laboratory, experimentation, cannot, exist, by, itself, but, that, there, should, be, an, active, interrelation, between, laboratory, experimentation, and, the, study, of, real, life, situations, also, while, festinger, is, praised, for, his, theoretical, rigor, and, experimental, approach, to, social, psychology, he, is, regarded, as, having, contributed, to, the, estrangement, between, basic, and, applied, social, psychology, in, the, united, states, he, became, a, symbol, of, the, tough, minded, theory, oriented, pure, experimental, scientist, while, ron, lippitt, a, fellow, faculty, member, at, lewin, s, research, center, for, group, dynamics, with, whom, festinger, often, clashed, became, a, symbol, of, the, fuzzy, minded, do, gooder, practitioner, of, applied, social, psychology, one, of, the, greatest, impacts, of, festinger, s, studies, lies, in, their, depict, of, social, behavior, as, the, responses, of, a, thinking, organism, continually, acting, to, bring, order, into, his, world, rather, than, as, the, blind, impulses, of, a, creature, of, emotion, and, habit, as, cited, in, his, distinguished, scientific, contribution, award, behaviorism, which, had, dominated, psychology, until, that, time, characterized, man, as, a, creature, of, habit, conditioned, by, stimulus, response, reinforcement, processes, behaviorists, focused, only, on, the, observable, i, e, behavior, and, external, rewards, with, no, reference, to, cognitive, or, emotional, processes, theories, like, cognitive, dissonance, could, not, be, explained, in, behaviorist, terms, for, example, liking, was, simply, a, function, of, reward, according, to, behaviorism, so, greater, reward, would, produce, greater, liking, festinger, and, carlsmith, s, experiment, clearly, demonstrated, greater, liking, with, lower, reward, a, result, that, required, the, acknowledgement, of, cognitive, processes, with, festinger, s, theories, and, the, research, that, they, generated, the, monolithic, grip, that, reinforcement, theory, had, held, on, social, psychology, was, effectively, and, permanently, broken
