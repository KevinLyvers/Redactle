technology, mit, morris, halle, and, roman, jakobson, the, latter, of, whom, secured, him, an, assistant, professor, position, there, in, 1955, at, mit, chomsky, spent, half, his, time, on, a, mechanical, translation, project, and, half, teaching, a, course, on, linguistics, and, philosophy, he, described, mit, as, open, to, experimentation, where, he, was, free, to, pursue, his,

challenge, to, the, dominant, behaviorist, paradigm, thrust, chomsky, into, the, limelight, chomsky, argued, that, behaviorism, underplayed, the, role, of, human, creativity, in, learning, language,

rift, later, known, as, the, linguistic, wars, developed, between, chomsky, and, some, of, his, colleagues, and, doctoral, students, including, paul, postal, john, ross, george, lakoff, and, james, d, mccawley, who, contended, that, chomsky, s, syntax, based, interpretivist, linguistics, did, not, properly, account, for, semantic, context, general, semantics, a, post, hoc, assessment, of, this, period, concluded, that, the, opposing, programs, ultimately, were, complementary, each, informing, the, other, t, does, not, require, very, far, reaching, specialized, knowledge, to, perceive, that, the, united, states, was, invading, south, vietnam, and, in, fact, to, take, apart, the, system, of, illusions, and, deception, which, functions, to, prevent, understanding, of, contemporary, reality, not, a, task, that, requires, extraordinary, skill, or, understanding, it, requires, the, kind, of, normal, skepticism, and, willingness, to, apply, one, s, analytical, skills, that, almost, all, people, have, and, that, they, can, exercise, chomsky, on, the, vietnam, war, chomsky, joined, protests, against, u, s, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, in, 1962, speaking, on, the, subject, at, small, gatherings, in, churches, and, homes, his, 1967, critique, of, u, s, involvement, the, responsibility, of, intellectuals, among, other, contributions, to, the, new, york, review, of, books,

middle, east, 1974, published, by, pantheon, books, these, publications, led, to, chomsky, s, association, with, the, american, new, left, movement, though, he, thought, little, of, prominent, new, left, intellectuals, herbert, marcuse, and, erich, fromm, and, preferred, the, company, of, activists, to, that, of, intellectuals, chomsky, remained, largely, ignored, by, the, mainstream, press,

groups, and, with, his, colleague, louis, kampf, ran, undergraduate, courses, on, politics, at, mit, independently, of, the, conservative, dominated, political, science, department, when, student, activists, campaigned, to, stop, weapons, and, counterinsurgency, research, at, mit, chomsky, was, sympathetic, but, felt, that, the, research, should, remain, under, mit, s, oversight, and, limited, to, systems, of, deterrence, and, defense, chomsky, has, acknowledged, that, his, mit, lab, s, funding, at, this, time, came, from, the, military, he, later, said, he, considered, resigning, from, mit, during, the, vietnam, war, there, has, since, been, a, wide, ranging, debate, about, what, effects, chomsky, s, employment, at, mit, had, on, his, political, and, linguistic, ideas, chomsky, s, anti, war, activism, led, to, his, arrest, on, multiple, occasions, and, he, was, on, president, richard, nixon, s, master, list, of, political, opponents, chomsky, was, aware, of, the, potential, repercussions, of, his, civil, disobedience, and, his, wife, began, studying, for, her, own, doctorate, in, linguistics, to, support, the, family, in, the, event, of, chomsky, s, imprisonment, or,

edition, of, language, and, mind, 1972, and, reflections, on, language, 1975, in, 1974, chomsky, became, a, corresponding, fellow, of, the, british, academy, in, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, chomsky,

controversy, particularly, when, he, criticized, the, israeli, government, and, military, in, the, early, 1970s, chomsky, began, collaborating, with, edward, s, herman, who, had, also, published, critiques, of, the, u, s, war, in, vietnam, together, they, wrote, counter, revolutionary, violence, bloodbaths, in, fact, propaganda, a, book, that, criticized, u, s, military, involvement, in, southeast, asia, and, the, mainstream, media, s, failure, to, cover, it, warner, modular, published, it, in, 1973, but, its, parent, company, disapproved, of, the, book, s, contents, and, ordered,

reactions, to, the, cambodian, genocide, and, the, indonesian, occupation, of, east, timor, it, argues, that, because, indonesia, was, a, u, s, ally, u, s, media, ignored, the, east, timorese, situation, while, focusing, on, events, in, cambodia, a, u, s, enemy, chomsky, s, response, included, two, testimonials, before, the, united, nations, special, committee, on, decolonization, successful, encouragement, for, american, media, to, cover, the, occupation, and, meetings, with, refugees, in, lisbon, marxist, academic, steven, lukes, most, prominently, publicly, accused, chomsky, of, betraying, his, anarchist, ideals, and, acting, as, an, apologist, for, cambodian, leader, pol, pot, herman, said, that, the, controversy, imposed, a, serious, personal, cost, on, chomsky, who, considered, the, personal, criticism, less, important, than, the, evidence, that, mainstream, intelligentsia, suppressed, or, justified, the, crimes, of, their, own, states, chomsky, had, long, publicly, criticized, nazism, and, totalitarianism, more, generally, but, his, commitment, to, freedom, of, speech, led, him, to, defend, the, right, of, french, historian, robert, faurisson, to, advocate, a, position, widely, characterized, as, holocaust, denial, without, chomsky, s, knowledge, his, plea, for, faurisson, s, freedom, of, speech, was, published, as, the, preface, to, the, latter, s, 1980, book, m, moire, en, d, fense, contre, ceux, qui, m, accusent, de, falsifier, l, histoire, chomsky, was, widely, condemned, for, defending, faurisson, and, france, s, mainstream, press, accused, chomsky, of, being, a, holocaust, denier, himself, refusing, to, publish, his, rebuttals, to, their, accusations, critiquing, chomsky, s, position, sociologist, werner, cohn, later, published, an, analysis, of, the, affair, titled, partners, in, hate, noam, chomsky, and, the, holocaust, deniers, the, faurisson, affair, had, a, lasting, damaging, effect, on, chomsky, s, career, especially, in, france, in, 1985, during, the, nicaraguan, contra, war, in, which, the, u, s, supported, the, contra, militia, against, the, sandinista, government, chomsky, traveled, to, managua, to, meet, with, workers, organizations, and, refugees, of, the, conflict, giving, public, lectures, on, politics, and, linguistics, many, of, these, lectures, were, published, in, 1987, as, on, power, and, ideology, the, managua, lectures, in, 1983, he, published, the, fateful, triangle, which, argued, that, the, u, s, had, continually, used, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, for, its, own, ends, in, 1988, chomsky, visited, the, palestinian, territories, to, witness, the, impact, of, israeli, occupation, chomsky, and, herman, s, manufacturing, consent, the, political, economy, of, the, mass, media, 1988, outlines, their, propaganda, model, for, understanding, mainstream, media, even, in, countries, without, official, censorship, they, argued, the, news, is, censored, through, five, filters, that, greatly, influence, both, what, and, how, news, is, presented, the, book, received, a, 1992, film, adaptation, in, 1989, chomsky, published, necessary, illusions, thought, control, in, democratic, societies, in, which, he, suggests, that, a, worthwhile, democracy, requires, that, its, citizens, undertake, intellectual, self, defense, against, the, media, and, elite, intellectual, culture, that, seeks, to, control, them, by, the, 1980s, chomsky, s, students, had, become, prominent, linguists, who, in, turn, expanded, and, revised, his, linguistic, theories, in, the, 1990s, chomsky, embraced, political, activism, to, a, greater, degree, than, before, retaining, his, commitment, to, the, cause, of, east, timorese, independence, in, 1995, he, visited, australia, to, talk, on, the, issue, at, the, behest, of, the, east, timorese, relief, association, and, the, national, council, for, east, timorese, resistance, the, lectures, he, gave, on, the, subject, were, published, as, powers, and, prospects, in, 1996, as, a, result, of, the, international, publicity, chomsky, generated, his, biographer, wolfgang, sperlich, opined, that, he, did, more, to, aid, the, cause, of, east, timorese, independence, than, anyone, but, the, investigative, journalist, john, pilger, after, east, timor, attained, independence, from, indonesia, in, 1999, the, australian, led, international, force, for, east, timor, arrived, as, a, peacekeeping, force, chomsky, was, critical, of, this, believing, it, was, designed, to, secure, australian, access, to, east, timor, s, oil, and, gas, reserves, under, the, timor, gap, treaty, chomsky, was, widely, interviewed, after, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 2001, as, the, american, public, attempted, to, make, sense, of, the, attacks, he, argued, that, the, ensuing, war, on, terror, was, not, a, new, development, but, a, continuation, of, u, s, foreign, policy, and, concomitant, rhetoric, since, at, least, the, reagan, era, he, gave, the, d, t, lakdawala, memorial, lecture, in, new, delhi, in, 2001, and, in, 2003, visited, cuba, at, the, invitation, of, the, latin, american, association, of, social, scientists, chomsky, s, 2003, hegemony, or, survival, articulated, what, he, called, the, united, states, imperial, grand, strategy, and, critiqued, the, iraq, war, and, other, aspects, of, the, war, on, terror, chomsky, toured, internationally, with, greater, regularity, during, this, period, during, the, 2014, scottish, independence, referendum, chomsky, supported, scottish, independence, chomsky, retired, from, mit, in, 2002, but, continued, to, conduct, research, and, seminars, on, campus, as, an, emeritus, that, same, year, he, visited, turkey, to, attend, the, trial, of, a, publisher, who, had, been, accused, of, treason, for, printing, one, of, chomsky, s, books, chomsky, insisted, on, being, a, co, defendant, and, amid, international, media, attention, the, security, courts, dropped, the, charge, on, the, first, day, during, that, trip, chomsky, visited, kurdish, areas, of, turkey, and, spoke, out, in, favor, of, the, kurds, human, rights, a, supporter, of, the, world, social, forum, he, attended, its, conferences, in, brazil, in, both, 2002, and, 2003, also, attending, the, forum, event, in, india, chomsky, supported, the, 2011, occupy, movement, speaking, at, encampments, and, publishing, on, the, movement, which, he, called, a, reaction, to, a, 30, year, class, war, the, 2015, documentary, requiem, for, the, american, dream, summarizes, his, views, on, capitalism, and, economic, inequality, through, a, 75, minute, teach, in, in, 2015, chomsky, and, his, wife, purchased, a, residence, in, s, o, paulo, brazil, and, began, splitting, their, time, between, brazil, and, the, u, s, chomsky, taught, a, short, term, politics, course, at, the, university, of, arizona, in, 2017, and, was, later, hired, as, a, part, time, professor, in, the, linguistics, department, there, his, duties, including, teaching, and, public, seminars, his, salary, was, covered, by, philanthropic, donations, after, a, stroke, in, june, 2023, chomsky, moved, to, brazil, full, time, this, was, not, publicly, reported, until, june, 2024, what, started, as, purely, linguistic, research, has, led, through, involvement, in, political, causes, and, an, identification, with, an, older, philosophic, tradition, to, no, less, than, an, attempt, to, formulate, an, overall, theory, of, man, the, roots, of, this, are, manifest, in, the, linguistic, theory, the, discovery, of, cognitive, structures, common, to, the, human, race, but, only, to, humans, species, specific, leads, quite, easily, to, thinking, of, unalienable, human, attributes, edward, marcotte, on, the, significance, of, chomsky, s, linguistic, theory, the, basis, of, chomsky, s, linguistic, theory, lies, in, biolinguistics, the, linguistic, school, that, holds, that, the, principles, underpinning, the, structure, of, language, are, biologically, preset, in, the, human, mind, and, hence, genetically, inherited, he, argues, that, all, humans, share, the, same, underlying, linguistic, structure, irrespective, of, sociocultural, differences, in, adopting, this, position, chomsky, rejects, the, radical, behaviorist, psychology, of, b, f, skinner, who, viewed, speech, thought, and, all, behavior, as, a, completely, learned, product, of, the, interactions, between, organisms, and, their, environments, accordingly, chomsky, argues, that, language, is, a, unique, evolutionary, development, of, the, human, species, and, distinguished, from, modes, of, communication, used, by, any, other, animal, species, chomsky, argues, that, his, nativist, internalist, view, of, language, is, consistent, with, the, philosophical, school, of, rationalism, and, contrasts, with, the, anti, nativist, externalist, view, of, language, consistent, with, the, philosophical, school, of, empiricism, which, contends, that, all, knowledge, including, language, comes, from, external, stimuli, historians, have, disputed, chomsky, s, claim, about, rationalism, on, the, basis, that, his, theory, of, innate, grammar, excludes, propositional, knowledge, and, instead, focuses, on, innate, learning, capacities, or, structures, since, the, 1960s, chomsky, has, maintained, that, syntactic, knowledge, is, at, least, partially, inborn, implying, that, children, need, only, learn, certain, language, specific, features, of, their, native, languages, he, bases, his, argument, on, observations, about, human, language, acquisition, and, describes, a, poverty, of, the, stimulus, an, enormous, gap, between, the, linguistic, stimuli, to, which, children, are, exposed, and, the, rich, linguistic, competence, they, attain, for, example, although, children, are, exposed, to, only, a, very, small, and, finite, subset, of, the, allowable, syntactic, variants, within, their, first, language, they, somehow, acquire, the, highly, organized, and, systematic, ability, to, understand, and, produce, an, infinite, number, of, sentences, including, ones, that, have, never, before, been, uttered, in, that, language, to, explain, this, chomsky, reasoned, that, the, primary, linguistic, data, must, be, supplemented, by, an, innate, linguistic, capacity, furthermore, while, a, human, baby, and, a, kitten, are, both, capable, of, inductive, reasoning, if, they, are, exposed, to, exactly, the, same, linguistic, data, the, human, will, always, acquire, the, ability, to, understand, and, produce, language, while, the, kitten, will, never, acquire, either, ability, chomsky, referred, to, this, difference, in, capacity, as, the, language, acquisition, device, and, suggested, that, linguists, needed, to, determine, both, what, that, device, is, and, what, constraints, it, imposes, on, the, range, of, possible, human, languages, the, universal, features, that, result, from, these, constraints, would, constitute, universal, grammar, multiple, scholars, have, challenged, universal, grammar, on, the, grounds, of, the, evolutionary, infeasibility, of, its, genetic, basis, for, language, the, lack, of, universal, characteristics, between, languages, and, the, unproven, link, between, innate, universal, structures, and, the, structures, of, specific, languages, scholar, michael, tomasello, has, challenged, chomsky, s, theory, of, innate, syntactic, knowledge, as, based, on, theory, and, not, behavioral, observation, although, it, was, influential, from, 1960s, through, 1990s, chomsky, s, nativist, theory, was, ultimately, rejected, by, the, mainstream, child, language, acquisition, research, community, owing, to, its, inconsistency, with, research, evidence, it, was, also, argued, by, linguists, including, robert, freidin, geoffrey, sampson, geoffrey, k, pullum, and, barbara, scholz, that, chomsky, s, linguistic, evidence, for, it, had, been, false, transformational, generative, grammar, is, a, broad, theory, used, to, model, encode, and, deduce, a, native, speaker, s, linguistic, capabilities, these, models, or, formal, grammars, show, the, abstract, structures, of, a, specific, language, as, they, may, relate, to, structures, in, other, languages, chomsky, developed, transformational, grammar, in, the, mid, 1950s, whereupon, it, became, the, dominant, syntactic, theory, in, linguistics, for, two, decades, transformations, refers, to, syntactic, relationships, within, language, e, g, being, able, to, infer, that, the, subject, between, two, sentences, is, the, same, person, chomsky, s, theory, posits, that, language, consists, of, both, deep, structures, and, surface, structures, outward, facing, surface, structures, relate, phonetic, rules, into, sound, while, inward, facing, deep, structures, relate, words, and, conceptual, meaning, transformational, generative, grammar, uses, mathematical, notation, to, express, the, rules, that, govern, the, connection, between, meaning, and, sound, deep, and, surface, structures, respectively, by, this, theory, linguistic, principles, can, mathematically, generate, potential, sentence, structures, in, a, language, chomsky, is, commonly, credited, with, inventing, transformational, generative, grammar, but, his, original, contribution, was, considered, modest, when, he, first, published, his, theory, in, his, 1955, dissertation, and, his, 1957, textbook, syntactic, structures, he, presented, recent, developments, in, the, analysis, formulated, by, zellig, harris, who, was, chomsky, s, phd, supervisor, and, by, charles, f, hockett, their, method, is, derived, from, the, work, of, the, danish, structural, linguist, louis, hjelmslev, who, introduced, algorithmic, grammar, to, general, linguistics, based, on, this, rule, based, notation, of, grammars, chomsky, grouped, logically, possible, phrase, structure, grammar, types, into, a, series, of, four, nested, subsets, and, increasingly, complex, types, together, known, as, the, chomsky, hierarchy, this, classification, remains, relevant, to, formal, language, theory, and, theoretical, computer, science, especially, programming, language, theory, compiler, construction, and, automata, theory, chomsky, s, syntactic, structures, became, beyond, generative, linguistics, as, such, a, catalyst, concerning, the, connection, of, what, in, hjelmslev, and, jesperson, time, were, the, beginnings, of, structural, linguistics, and, what, today, has, morphed, into, cognitive, linguistics, transformational, grammar, was, the, dominant, research, paradigm, through, the, mid, 1970s, the, derivative, government, and, binding, theory, replaced, it, and, remained, influential, through, the, early, 1990s, when, linguists, turned, to, a, minimalist, approach, to, grammar, this, research, focused, on, the, principles, and, parameters, framework, which, explained, children, s, ability, to, learn, any, language, by, filling, open, parameters, a, set, of, universal, grammar, principles, that, adapt, as, the, child, encounters, linguistic, data, the, minimalist, program, initiated, by, chomsky, asks, which, minimal, principles, and, parameters, theory, fits, most, elegantly, naturally, and, simply, in, an, attempt, to, simplify, language, into, a, system, that, relates, meaning, and, sound, using, the, minimum, possible, faculties, chomsky, dispenses, with, concepts, such, as, deep, structure, and, surface, structure, and, instead, emphasizes, the, plasticity, of, the, brain, s, neural, circuits, with, which, come, an, infinite, number, of, concepts, or, logical, forms, when, exposed, to, linguistic, data, a, hearer, speaker, s, brain, proceeds, to, associate, sound, and, meaning, and, the, rules, of, grammar, we, observe, are, in, fact, only, the, consequences, or, side, effects, of, the, way, language, works, thus, while, much, of, chomsky, s, prior, research, focused, on, the, rules, of, language, he, now, focuses, on, the, mechanisms, the, brain, uses, to, generate, these, rules, and, regulate, speech, the, second, major, area, to, which, chomsky, has, contributed, and, surely, the, best, known, in, terms, of, the, number, of, people, in, his, audience, and, the, ease, of, understanding, what, he, writes, and, says, is, his, work, on, sociopolitical, analysis, political, social, and, economic, history, and, critical, assessment, of, current, political, circumstance, in, chomsky, s, view, although, those, in, power, might, and, do, try, to, obscure, their, intentions, and, to, defend, their, actions, in, ways, that, make, them, acceptable, to, citizens, it, is, easy, for, anyone, who, is, willing, to, be, critical, and, consider, the, facts, to, discern, what, they, are, up, to, james, mcgilvray, 2014, chomsky, is, a, prominent, political, dissident, his, political, views, have, changed, little, since, his, childhood, when, he, was, influenced, by, the, emphasis, on, political, activism, that, was, ingrained, in, jewish, working, class, tradition, he, usually, identifies, as, an, anarcho, syndicalist, or, a, libertarian, socialist, he, views, these, positions, not, as, precise, political, theories, but, as, ideals, that, he, thinks, best, meet, human, needs, liberty, community, and, freedom, of, association, unlike, some, other, socialists, such, as, marxists, chomsky, believes, that, politics, lies, outside, the, remit, of, science, but, he, still, roots, his, ideas, about, an, ideal, society, in, empirical, data, and, empirically, justified, theories, in, chomsky, s, view, the, truth, about, political, realities, is, systematically, distorted, or, suppressed, by, an, elite, corporatocracy, which, uses, corporate, media, advertising, and, think, tanks, to, promote, its, own, propaganda, his, work, seeks, to, reveal, such, manipulations, and, the, truth, they, obscure, chomsky, believes, this, web, of, falsehood, can, be, broken, by, common, sense, critical, thinking, and, understanding, the, roles, of, self, interest, and, self, deception, and, that, intellectuals, abdicate, their, moral, responsibility, to, tell, the, truth, about, the, world, in, fear, of, losing, prestige, and, funding, he, argues, that, as, such, an, intellectual, it, is, his, duty, to, use, his, social, privilege, resources, and, training, to, aid, popular, democracy, movements, in, their, struggles, although, he, has, participated, in, direct, action, demonstrations, joining, protests, being, arrested, organizing, groups, chomsky, s, primary, political, outlet, is, education, i, e, free, public, lessons, he, is, a, longtime, member, of, the, industrial, workers, of, the, world, international, union, as, was, his, father, chomsky, has, been, a, prominent, critic, of, american, imperialism, but, is, not, a, pacifist, believing, world, war, ii, was, justified, as, america, s, last, defensive, war, he, believes, that, u, s, foreign, policy, s, basic, principle, is, the, establishment, of, open, societies, that, are, economically, and, politically, controlled, by, the, u, s, and, where, u, s, based, businesses, can, prosper, he, argues, that, the, u, s, seeks, to, suppress, any, movements, within, these, countries, that, are, not, compliant, with, u, s, interests, and, to, ensure, that, u, s, friendly, governments, are, placed, in, power, when, discussing, current, events, he, emphasizes, their, place, within, a, wider, historical, perspective, he, believes, that, official, sanctioned, historical, accounts, of, u, s, and, british, extraterritorial, operations, have, consistently, whitewashed, these, nations, actions, in, order, to, present, them, as, having, benevolent, motives, in, either, spreading, democracy, or, in, older, instances, spreading, christianity, by, criticizing, these, accounts, he, seeks, to, correct, them, prominent, examples, he, regularly, cites, are, the, actions, of, the, british, empire, in, india, and, africa, and, u, s, actions, in, vietnam, the, philippines, latin, america, and, the, middle, east, chomsky, s, political, work, has, centered, heavily, on, criticizing, the, actions, of, the, united, states, he, has, said, he, focuses, on, the, u, s, because, the, country, has, militarily, and, economically, dominated, the, world, during, his, lifetime, and, because, its, liberal, democratic, electoral, system, allows, the, citizenry, to, influence, government, policy, his, hope, is, that, by, spreading, awareness, of, the, impact, u, s, foreign, policies, have, on, the, populations, affected, by, them, he, can, sway, the, populations, of, the, u, s, and, other, countries, into, opposing, the, policies, he, urges, people, to, criticize, their, governments, motivations, decisions, and, actions, to, accept, responsibility, for, their, own, thoughts, and, actions, and, to, apply, the, same, standards, to, others, as, to, themselves, chomsky, has, been, critical, of, u, s, involvement, in, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, arguing, that, it, has, consistently, blocked, a, peaceful, settlement, he, also, criticizes, the, u, s, s, close, ties, with, saudi, arabia, and, involvement, in, saudi, arabian, led, intervention, in, yemen, highlighting, that, saudi, arabia, has, one, of, the, most, grotesque, human, rights, records, in, the, world, he, called, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, a, criminal, act, of, aggression, and, noted, that, russia, was, committing, major, war, crimes, in, the, country, chomsky, considered, support, for, ukraine, s, self, defense, legitimate, he, said, ukraine, should, be, given, enough, military, aid, to, defend, itself, but, not, enough, to, cause, an, escalation, his, criticism, of, the, war, focused, on, the, united, states, he, alleged, that, the, u, s, rejected, any, compromise, with, russia, saying, this, might, have, provoked, the, invasion, to, begin, with, according, to, chomsky, the, u, s, was, arming, ukraine, only, to, weaken, russia, and, ukrainian, requests, for, heavy, weaponry, were, untrue, western, propaganda, despite, ukraine, s, president, volodymyr, zelensky, repeatedly, asking, for, them, more, than, a, year, into, the, invasion, chomsky, argued, that, russia, was, waging, the, war, more, humanely, than, the, u, s, did, in, the, invasion, of, iraq, in, his, youth, chomsky, developed, a, dislike, of, capitalism, and, the, pursuit, of, material, wealth, at, the, same, time, he, developed, a, disdain, for, authoritarian, socialism, as, represented, by, the, marxist, leninist, policies, of, the, soviet, union, rather, than, accepting, the, common, view, among, u, s, economists, that, a, spectrum, exists, between, total, state, ownership, of, the, economy, and, total, private, ownership, he, instead, suggests, that, a, spectrum, should, be, understood, between, total, democratic, control, of, the, economy, and, total, autocratic, control, whether, state, or, private, he, argues, that, western, capitalist, countries, are, not, really, democratic, because, in, his, view, a, truly, democratic, society, is, one, in, which, all, persons, have, a, say, in, public, economic, policy, he, has, stated, his, opposition, to, ruling, elites, among, them, institutions, like, the, imf, world, bank, and, gatt, precursor, to, the, wto, chomsky, highlights, that, since, the, 1970s, the, u, s, has, become, increasingly, economically, unequal, as, a, result, of, the, repeal, of, various, financial, regulations, and, the, unilateral, rescinding, of, the, bretton, woods, financial, control, agreement, by, the, u, s, he, characterizes, the, u, s, as, a, de, facto, one, party, state, viewing, both, the, republican, party, and, democratic, party, as, manifestations, of, a, single, business, party, controlled, by, corporate, and, financial, interests, chomsky, highlights, that, within, western, capitalist, liberal, democracies, at, least, 80, of, the, population, has, no, control, over, economic, decisions, which, are, instead, in, the, hands, of, a, management, class, and, ultimately, controlled, by, a, small, wealthy, elite, noting, the, entrenchment, of, such, an, economic, system, chomsky, believes, that, change, is, possible, through, the, organized, cooperation, of, large, numbers, of, people, who, understand, the, problem, and, know, how, they, want, to, reorganize, the, economy, more, equitably, acknowledging, that, corporate, domination, of, media, and, government, stifles, any, significant, change, to, this, system, he, sees, reason, for, optimism, in, historical, examples, such, as, the, social, rejection, of, slavery, as, immoral, the, advances, in, women, s, rights, and, the, forcing, of, government, to, justify, invasions, he, views, violent, revolution, to, overthrow, a, government, as, a, last, resort, to, be, avoided, if, possible, citing, the, example, of, historical, revolutions, where, the, population, s, welfare, has, worsened, as, a, result, of, upheaval, chomsky, sees, libertarian, socialist, and, anarcho, syndicalist, ideas, as, the, descendants, of, the, classical, liberal, ideas, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, arguing, that, his, ideological, position, revolves, around, nourishing, the, libertarian, and, creative, character, of, the, human, being, he, envisions, an, anarcho, syndicalist, future, with, direct, worker, control, of, the, means, of, production, and, government, by, workers, councils, who, would, select, temporary, and, revocable, representatives, to, meet, together, at, general, assemblies, the, point, of, this, self, governance, is, to, make, each, citizen, in, thomas, jefferson, s, words, a, direct, participator, in, the, government, of, affairs, he, believes, that, there, will, be, no, need, for, political, parties, by, controlling, their, productive, life, he, believes, that, individuals, can, gain, job, satisfaction, and, a, sense, of, fulfillment, and, purpose, he, argues, that, unpleasant, and, unpopular, jobs, could, be, fully, automated, specially, remunerated, or, communally, shared, chomsky, has, written, prolifically, about, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, aiming, to, raise, public, awareness, of, it, a, labor, zionist, who, later, became, what, is, today, considered, an, anti, zionist, chomsky, has, criticized, the, israeli, settlements, in, the, israeli, occupied, west, bank, which, he, likens, to, a, settler, colony, he, has, said, that, the, 1947, united, nations, partition, plan, for, palestine, was, a, bad, decision, but, given, the, realpolitik, of, the, situation, he, has, also, considered, a, two, state, solution, on, the, condition, that, the, nation, states, exist, on, equal, terms, chomsky, has, said, that, characterizing, israel, s, treatment, of, the, palestinians, as, apartheid, similar, to, the, system, that, existed, in, south, africa, would, be, a, gift, to, israel, as, he, has, long, held, that, the, occupied, territories, are, much, worse, than, south, africa, south, africa, depended, on, its, black, population, for, labor, but, chomsky, argues, the, same, is, not, true, of, israel, which, in, his, view, seeks, to, make, the, situation, for, palestinians, under, its, occupation, unlivable, especially, in, the, west, bank, and, the, gaza, strip, where, atrocities, take, place, every, day, he, also, argues, that, unlike, south, africa, israel, has, not, sought, the, international, community, s, approval, but, rather, relies, solely, on, u, s, support, chomsky, has, said, that, the, israeli, led, blockade, of, the, gaza, strip, has, turned, it, into, a, concentration, camp, and, expressed, similar, fears, to, israeli, intellectual, yeshayahu, leibowitz, s, 1990s, warning, that, the, continued, occupation, of, the, palestinian, territories, could, turn, israeli, jews, into, judeo, nazis, chomsky, has, said, that, leibowitz, s, warning, was, a, direct, reflection, of, the, continued, occupation, the, humiliation, of, people, the, degradation, and, the, terrorist, attacks, by, the, israeli, government, he, has, also, called, the, u, s, a, violent, state, that, exports, violence, by, supporting, israeli, atrocities, against, the, palestinians, and, said, that, listening, to, american, mainstream, media, including, cbs, is, like, listening, to, israeli, propaganda, agencies, chomsky, was, denied, entry, to, the, west, bank, in, 2010, because, of, his, criticisms, of, israel, he, had, been, invited, to, deliver, a, lecture, at, bir, zeit, university, and, was, to, meet, with, palestinian, prime, minister, salam, fayyad, an, israeli, foreign, ministry, spokesman, later, said, that, chomsky, was, denied, entry, by, mistake, in, his, 1983, book, the, fateful, triangle, chomsky, criticized, the, palestinian, liberation, organization, for, its, self, destructiveness, and, suicidal, character, and, disapproved, of, its, programs, of, armed, struggle, and, erratic, violence, he, also, criticized, the, arab, governments, as, not, decent, given, what, he, has, described, as, his, very, jewish, upbringing, with, deeply, zionist, activist, parents, chomsky, s, views, have, drawn, controversy, and, criticism, they, are, rooted, in, the, kibbutzim, and, socialist, binational, cooperation, in, a, 2014, interview, on, democracy, now, chomsky, said, that, the, charter, of, hamas, which, calls, for, israel, s, destruction, means, practically, nothing, having, been, created, by, a, small, group, of, people, under, siege, under, attack, in, 1988, he, compared, it, to, the, electoral, program, of, the, likud, party, which, he, said, states, explicitly, that, there, can, never, be, a, palestinian, state, west, of, the, jordan, river, and, they, not, only, state, it, in, their, charter, that, s, a, call, for, the, destruction, of, palestine, explicit, call, for, it, chomsky, s, political, writings, have, largely, focused, on, ideology, social, and, political, power, mass, media, and, state, policy, one, of, his, best, known, works, manufacturing, consent, dissects, the, media, s, role, in, reinforcing, and, acquiescing, to, state, policies, across, the, political, spectrum, while, marginalizing, contrary, perspectives, chomsky, asserts, that, this, version, of, censorship, by, government, guided, free, market, forces, is, subtler, and, harder, to, undermine, than, was, the, equivalent, propaganda, system, in, the, soviet, union, as, he, argues, the, mainstream, press, is, corporate, owned, and, thus, reflects, corporate, priorities, and, interests, acknowledging, that, many, american, journalists, are, dedicated, and, well, meaning, he, argues, that, the, mass, media, s, choices, of, topics, and, issues, the, unquestioned, premises, on, which, that, coverage, rests, and, the, range, of, opinions, expressed, are, all, constrained, to, reinforce, the, state, s, ideology, although, mass, media, will, criticize, individual, politicians, and, political, parties, it, will, not, undermine, the, wider, state, corporate, nexus, of, which, it, is, a, part, as, evidence, he, highlights, that, the, u, s, mass, media, does, not, employ, any, socialist, journalists, or, political, commentators, he, also, points, to, examples, of, important, news, stories, that, the, u, s, mainstream, media, has, ignored, because, reporting, on, them, would, reflect, badly, upon, the, country, including, the, murder, of, black, panther, fred, hampton, with, possible, fbi, involvement, the, massacres, in, nicaragua, perpetrated, by, u, s, funded, contras, and, the, constant, reporting, on, israeli, deaths, without, equivalent, coverage, of, the, far, larger, number, of, palestinian, deaths, in, that, conflict, to, remedy, this, situation, chomsky, calls, for, grassroots, democratic, control, and, involvement, of, the, media, chomsky, considers, most, conspiracy, theories, fruitless, distracting, substitutes, for, thinking, about, policy, formation, in, an, institutional, framework, where, individual, manipulation, is, secondary, to, broader, social, imperatives, he, separates, his, propaganda, model, from, conspiracy, in, that, he, is, describing, institutions, following, their, natural, imperatives, rather, than, collusive, forces, with, secret, controls, instead, of, supporting, the, educational, system, as, an, antidote, he, believes, that, most, education, is, counterproductive, chomsky, describes, mass, education, as, a, system, solely, intended, to, turn, farmers, from, independent, producers, into, unthinking, industrial, employees, in, the, 2004, book, the, anti, chomsky, reader, peter, collier, and, david, horowitz, accuse, chomsky, of, cherry, picking, facts, to, suit, his, theories, horowitz, has, also, criticized, chomsky, s, anti, americanism, for, 40, years, noam, chomsky, has, turned, out, book, after, book, pamphlet, after, pamphlet, and, speech, after, speech, with, one, message, and, one, message, alone, america, is, the, great, satan, it, is, the, fount, of, evil, in, the, world, in, chomsky, s, demented, universe, america, is, responsible, not, only, for, its, own, bad, deeds, but, for, the, bad, deeds, of, others, including, those, of, the, terrorists, who, struck, the, world, trade, center, and, the, pentagon, in, this, attitude, he, is, the, medium, for, all, those, who, now, search, the, ruins, of, manhattan, not, for, the, victims, and, the, american, dead, but, for, the, root, causes, of, the, catastrophe, that, befell, them, for, the, conservative, public, policy, think, tank, the, hoover, institution, peter, schweizer, wrote, in, january, 2006, chomsky, favors, the, estate, tax, and, massive, income, redistribution, just, not, the, redistribution, of, his, income, schweizer, criticized, chomsky, for, setting, up, an, estate, plan, and, protecting, his, own, intellectual, property, as, it, relates, to, his, published, works, as, well, as, the, high, speaking, fees, that, chomsky, received, on, a, regular, basis, around, 9, 000, 12, 000, per, talk, at, that, time, chomsky, has, been, accused, of, treating, socialist, or, communist, regimes, with, credulity, and, examining, capitalist, regimes, with, greater, scrutiny, or, criticism, chomsky, s, analysis, of, u, s, actions, plunged, deep, into, dark, u, s, machinations, but, when, traveling, among, the, communists, he, rested, content, with, appearances, the, countryside, outside, hanoi, he, reported, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, displayed, a, high, degree, of, democratic, participation, at, the, village, and, regional, levels, but, how, could, he, tell, chomsky, did, not, speak, vietnamese, and, so, he, depended, on, government, translators, tour, guides, and, handlers, for, information, in, vietnamese, hands, the, clear, eyed, skepticism, turned, into, willing, credulousness, according, to, nikolas, kozloff, writing, for, al, jazeera, in, september, 2012, chomsky, has, drawn, the, world, s, attention, to, the, various, misdeeds, of, the, us, and, its, proxies, around, the, world, and, for, that, he, deserves, credit, yet, in, seeking, to, avoid, controversy, at, all, costs, chomsky, has, turned, into, something, of, an, ideologue, scour, the, chomsky, web, site, and, you, won, t, find, significant, discussion, of, belarus, or, latin, america, s, flirtation, with, outside, authoritarian, leaders, for, that, matter, political, activist, george, monbiot, has, argued, that, part, of, the, problem, is, that, a, kind, of, cult, has, developed, around, noam, chomsky, and, john, pilger, which, cannot, believe, they, could, ever, be, wrong, and, produces, ever, more, elaborate, conspiracy, theories, to, justify, their, mistakes, anarchist, and, primitivist, john, zerzan, has, accused, chomsky, of, not, being, a, real, anarchist, saying, that, he, is, instead, a, liberal, leftist, politically, and, downright, reactionary, in, his, academic, specialty, linguistic, theory, chomsky, is, also, by, all, accounts, a, generous, sincere, tireless, activist, which, does, not, unfortunately, ensure, his, thinking, has, liberatory, value, defenders, of, chomsky, have, countered, that, he, has, been, censored, or, left, out, of, public, debate, claims, of, this, nature, date, to, the, reagan, era, writing, for, the, washington, post, in, february, 1988, saul, landau, wrote, it, is, unhealthy, that, chomsky, s, insights, are, excluded, from, the, policy, debate, his, relentless, prosecutorial, prose, with, a, hint, of, talmudic, whine, and, the, rationalist, anarchism, of, tom, paine, may, reflect, a, justified, frustration, chomsky, has, also, been, active, in, a, number, of, philosophical, fields, including, philosophy, of, mind, philosophy, of, language, and, philosophy, of, science, in, these, fields, he, is, credited, with, ushering, in, the, cognitive, revolution, a, significant, paradigm, shift, that, rejected, logical, positivism, the, prevailing, philosophical, methodology, of, the, time, and, reframed, how, philosophers, think, about, language, and, the, mind, chomsky, views, the, cognitive, revolution, as, rooted, in, 17th, century, rationalist, ideals, his, position, the, idea, that, the, mind, contains, inherent, structures, to, understand, language, perception, and, thought, has, more, in, common, with, rationalism, than, behaviorism, he, named, one, of, his, key, works, cartesian, linguistics, a, chapter, in, the, history, of, rationalist, thought, 1966, this, sparked, criticism, from, historians, and, philosophers, who, disagreed, with, chomsky, s, interpretations, of, classical, sources, and, use, of, philosophical, terminology, in, the, philosophy, of, language, chomsky, is, particularly, known, for, his, criticisms, of, the, notion, of, reference, and, meaning, in, human, language, and, his, perspective, on, the, nature, and, function, of, mental, representations, chomsky, s, famous, 1971, debate, on, human, nature, with, the, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, was, a, symbolic, clash, of, the, analytic, and, continental, philosophy, traditions, represented, by, chomsky, and, foucault, respectively, it, showed, what, appeared, to, be, irreconcilable, differences, between, two, moral, and, intellectual, luminaries, of, the, 20th, century, foucault, held, that, any, definition, of, human, nature, is, connected, to, our, present, day, conceptions, of, ourselves, chomsky, held, that, human, nature, contained, universals, such, as, a, common, standard, of, moral, justice, as, deduced, through, reason, chomsky, criticized, postmodernism, and, french, philosophy, generally, arguing, that, the, obscure, language, of, postmodern, leftist, philosophers, gives, little, aid, to, the, working, classes, he, has, also, debated, analytic, philosophers, including, tyler, burge, donald, davidson, michael, dummett, saul, kripke, thomas, nagel, hilary, putnam, willard, van, orman, quine, and, john, searle, chomsky, s, contributions, span, intellectual, and, world, history, including, the, history, of, philosophy, irony, is, a, recurring, characteristic, of, his, writing, such, as, rhetorically, implying, that, his, readers, already, know, something, to, be, true, which, engages, the, reader, more, actively, in, assessing, the, veracity, of, his, claims, chomsky, endeavors, to, separate, his, family, life, linguistic, scholarship, and, political, activism, from, each, other, an, intensely, private, person, he, is, uninterested, in, appearances, and, the, fame, his, work, has, brought, him, mcgilvray, suggests, that, chomsky, is, not, motivated, by, a, desire, for, fame, but, impelled, to, tell, what, he, perceives, as, the, truth, and, a, desire, to, aid, others, in, doing, so, chomsky, acknowledges, that, his, income, affords, him, a, privileged, life, compared, to, the, majority, of, the, world, s, population, nevertheless, he, characterizes, himself, as, a, worker, albeit, one, who, uses, his, intellect, as, his, employable, skill, he, reads, four, or, five, newspapers, daily, in, the, u, s, he, subscribes, to, the, boston, globe, the, new, york, times, the, wall, street, journal, financial, times, and, the, christian, science, monitor, chomsky, is, not, religious, but, has, expressed, approval, of, forms, of, religion, such, as, liberation, theology, chomsky, is, known, to, use, charged, language, corrupt, fascist, fraudulent, when, describing, established, political, and, academic, figures, which, can, polarize, his, audience, but, is, in, keeping, with, his, belief, that, much, scholarship, is, self, serving, his, colleague, steven, pinker, has, said, that, chomsky, portrays, people, who, disagree, with, him, as, stupid, or, evil, using, withering, scorn, in, his, rhetoric, and, that, this, contributes, to, the, extreme, reactions, he, receives, chomsky, avoids, academic, conferences, including, left, oriented, ones, such, as, the, socialist, scholars, conference, preferring, to, speak, to, activist, groups, or, hold, university, seminars, for, mass, audiences, his, approach, to, academic, freedom, has, led, him, to, support, mit, academics, whose, actions, he, deplores, in, 1969, when, chomsky, heard, that, walt, rostow, a, major, architect, of, the, vietnam, war, wanted, to, return, to, work, at, mit, chomsky, threatened, to, protest, publicly, if, rostow, were, denied, a, position, at, mit, in, 1989, when, pentagon, adviser, john, deutch, applied, to, be, president, of, mit, chomsky, supported, his, candidacy, later, when, deutch, became, head, of, the, cia, the, new, york, times, quoted, chomsky, as, saying, he, has, more, honesty, and, integrity, than, anyone, i, ve, ever, met, if, somebody, s, got, to, be, running, the, cia, i, m, glad, it, s, him, chomsky, was, married, to, carol, doris, n, e, schatz, from, 1949, until, her, death, in, 2008, they, had, three, children, together, aviva, b, 1957, diane, b, 1960, and, harry, b, 1967, in, 2014, chomsky, married, valeria, wasserman, they, have, owned, a, residence, in, wasserman, s, native, country, of, brazil, since, 2015, in, 2023, chomsky, suffered, a, massive, stroke, and, was, flown, to, a, hospital, in, s, o, paulo, brazil, to, recuperate, he, can, no, longer, walk, or, communicate, making, his, return, to, public, life, improbable, but, he, continues, to, follow, current, events, such, as, the, israel, hamas, war, he, was, discharged, in, june, 2024, to, continue, his, recovery, at, home, the, same, month, chomsky, trended, on, social, media, amid, false, reports, of, his, death, periodicals, retracted, premature, obituaries, voice, is, heard, in, academia, beyond, linguistics, and, philosophy, from, computer, science, to, neuroscience, from, anthropology, to, education, mathematics, and, literary, criticism, if, we, include, chomsky, s, political, activism, then, the, boundaries, become, quite, blurred, and, it, comes, as, no, surprise, that, chomsky, is, increasingly, seen, as, enemy, number, one, by, those, who, inhabit, that, wide, sphere, of, reactionary, discourse, and, action, sperlich, 2006, chomsky, has, been, a, defining, western, intellectual, figure, central, to, the, field, of, linguistics, and, definitive, in, cognitive, science, computer, science, philosophy, and, psychology, in, addition, to, being, known, as, one, of, the, most, important, intellectuals, of, his, time, chomsky, has, a, dual, legacy, as, a, leader, and, luminary, in, both, linguistics, and, the, realm, of, political, dissent, despite, his, academic, success, his, political, viewpoints, and, activism, have, resulted, in, his, being, distrusted, by, mainstream, media, and, he, is, regarded, as, being, on, the, outer, margin, of, acceptability, chomsky, s, public, image, and, social, reputation, often, color, his, work, s, public, reception, mcgilvray, observes, that, chomsky, inaugurated, the, cognitive, revolution, in, linguistics, and, that, he, is, largely, responsible, for, establishing, the, field, as, a, formal, natural, science, moving, it, away, from, the, procedural, form, of, structural, linguistics, dominant, during, the, mid, 20th, century, as, such, some, have, called, chomsky, the, father, of, modern, linguistics, linguist, john, lyons, further, remarked, that, within, a, few, decades, of, publication, chomskyan, linguistics, had, become, the, most, dynamic, and, influential, school, of, thought, in, the, field, by, the, 1970s, his, work, had, also, come, to, exert, a, considerable, influence, on, philosophy, and, a, minnesota, state, university, moorhead, poll, ranked, syntactic, structures, as, the, single, most, important, work, in, cognitive, science, in, addition, his, work, in, automata, theory, and, the, chomsky, hierarchy, have, become, well, known, in, computer, science, and, he, is, much, cited, in, computational, linguistics, chomsky, s, criticisms, of, behaviorism, contributed, substantially, to, the, decline, of, behaviorist, psychology, in, addition, he, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, primary, founders, of, the, field, of, cognitive, science, some, arguments, in, evolutionary, psychology, are, derived, from, his, research, results, nim, chimpsky, a, chimpanzee, who, was, the, subject, of, a, study, in, animal, language, acquisition, at, columbia, university, was, named, after, chomsky, in, reference, to, his, view, of, language, acquisition, as, a, uniquely, human, ability, acm, turing, award, winner, donald, knuth, credited, chomsky, s, work, with, helping, him, combine, his, interests, in, mathematics, linguistics, and, computer, science, ibm, computer, scientist, john, backus, another, turing, award, winner, used, some, of, chomsky, s, concepts, to, help, him, develop, fortran, the, first, widely, used, high, level, computer, programming, language, chomsky, s, theory, of, generative, grammar, has, also, influenced, work, in, music, theory, and, analysis, such, as, fred, lerdahl, s, and, ray, jackendoff, s, generative, theory, of, tonal, music, chomsky, is, among, the, most, cited, authors, living, or, dead, he, was, cited, within, the, arts, and, humanities, citation, index, more, often, than, any, other, living, scholar, from, 1980, to, 1992, chomsky, was, also, extensively, cited, in, the, social, sciences, citation, index, and, science, citation, index, during, the, same, period, the, librarian, who, conducted, the, research, said, that, the, statistics, show, that, he, is, very, widely, read, across, disciplines, and, that, his, work, is, used, by, researchers, across, disciplines, it, seems, that, you, can, t, write, a, paper, without, citing, noam, chomsky, as, a, result, of, his, influence, there, are, dueling, camps, of, chomskyan, and, non, chomskyan, linguistics, their, disputes, are, often, acrimonious, additionally, according, to, journalist, maya, jaggi, chomsky, is, among, the, most, quoted, sources, in, the, humanities, ranking, alongside, marx, shakespeare, and, the, bible, chomsky, s, status, as, the, most, quoted, living, author, is, credited, to, his, political, writings, which, vastly, outnumber, his, writings, on, linguistics, chomsky, biographer, wolfgang, b, sperlich, characterizes, him, as, one, of, the, most, notable, contemporary, champions, of, the, people, journalist, john, pilger, has, described, him, as, a, genuine, people, s, hero, an, inspiration, for, struggles, all, over, the, world, for, that, basic, decency, known, as, freedom, to, a, lot, of, people, in, the, margins, activists, and, movements, he, s, unfailingly, supportive, arundhati, roy, has, called, him, one, of, the, greatest, most, radical, public, thinkers, of, our, time, and, edward, said, thought, him, one, of, the, most, significant, challengers, of, unjust, power, and, delusions, fred, halliday, has, said, that, by, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, chomsky, had, become, a, guru, for, the, world, s, anti, capitalist, and, anti, imperialist, movements, the, propaganda, model, of, media, criticism, that, he, and, herman, developed, has, been, widely, accepted, in, radical, media, critiques, and, adopted, to, some, level, in, mainstream, criticism, of, the, media, also, exerting, a, significant, influence, on, the, growth, of, alternative, media, including, radio, publishers, and, the, internet, which, in, turn, have, helped, to, disseminate, his, work, despite, this, broad, influence, university, departments, devoted, to, history, and, political, science, rarely, include, chomsky, s, work, on, their, undergraduate, syllabi, critics, have, argued, that, despite, publishing, widely, on, social, and, political, issues, chomsky, has, no, formal, expertise, in, these, areas, he, has, responded, that, such, issues, are, not, as, complex, as, many, social, scientists, claim, and, that, almost, everyone, is, able, to, comprehend, them, regardless, of, whether, they, have, been, academically, trained, to, do, so, some, have, responded, to, these, criticisms, by, questioning, the, critics, motives, and, their, understanding, of, chomsky, s, ideas, sperlich, for, instance, says, that, chomsky, has, been, vilified, by, corporate, interests, particularly, in, the, mainstream, press, likewise, according, to, mcgilvray, many, of, chomsky, s, critics, do, not, bother, quoting, his, work, or, quote, out, of, context, distort, and, create, straw, men, that, cannot, be, supported, by, chomsky, s, text, chomsky, drew, criticism, for, not, calling, the, bosnian, war, s, srebrenica, massacre, a, genocide, while, he, did, not, deny, the, fact, of, the, massacre, which, he, called, a, horror, story, and, major, crime, he, felt, the, massacre, did, not, meet, the, definition, of, genocide, critics, have, accused, chomsky, of, denying, the, bosnian, genocide, chomsky, s, far, reaching, criticisms, of, u, s, foreign, policy, and, the, legitimacy, of, u, s, power, have, raised, controversy, a, document, obtained, pursuant, to, a, freedom, of, information, act, foia, request, from, the, u, s, government, revealed, that, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, monitored, his, activities, and, for, years, denied, doing, so, the, cia, also, destroyed, its, files, on, chomsky, at, some, point, possibly, in, violation, of, federal, law, he, has, often, received, undercover, police, protection, at, mit, and, when, speaking, on, the, middle, east, but, has, refused, uniformed, police, protection, german, news, magazine, der, spiegel, described, chomsky, as, the, ayatollah, of, anti, american, hatred, while, american, conservative, commentator, david, horowitz, called, him, the, most, devious, the, most, dishonest, and, the, most, treacherous, intellect, in, america, whose, work, is, infused, with, anti, american, dementia, and, evidences, his, pathological, hatred, of, his, own, country, writing, in, commentary, magazine, the, journalist, jonathan, kay, described, chomsky, as, a, hard, boiled, anti, american, monomaniac, who, simply, refuses, to, believe, anything, that, any, american, leader, says, chomsky, s, criticism, of, israel, has, led, to, his, being, called, a, traitor, to, the, jewish, people, and, an, anti, semite, criticizing, chomsky, s, defense, of, the, right, of, individuals, to, engage, in, holocaust, denial, on, the, grounds, that, freedom, of, speech, must, be, extended, to, all, viewpoints, werner, cohn, called, chomsky, the, most, important, patron, of, the, neo, nazi, movement, the, anti, defamation, league, adl, called, him, a, holocaust, denier, describing, him, as, a, dupe, of, intellectual, pride, so, overweening, that, he, is, incapable, of, making, distinctions, between, totalitarian, and, democratic, societies, between, oppressors, and, victims, in, turn, chomsky, has, claimed, that, the, adl, is, dominated, by, stalinist, types, who, oppose, democracy, in, israel, the, lawyer, alan, dershowitz, has, called, chomsky, a, false, prophet, of, the, left, chomsky, called, dershowitz, a, complete, liar, who, is, on, a, crazed, jihad, dedicating, much, of, his, life, to, trying, to, destroy, my, reputation, in, early, 2016, president, recep,
