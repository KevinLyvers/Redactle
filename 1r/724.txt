democritus, d, m, k, r, t, s, dim, ock, rit, s, greek, d, m, kritos, meaning, chosen, of, the, people, c, 460, c, 370, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, pre, socratic, philosopher, from, abdera, primarily, remembered, today, for, his, formulation, of, an, atomic, theory, of, the, universe, democritus, wrote, extensively, on, a, wide, variety, of, topics, none, of, democritus, original, work, has, survived, except, through, second, hand, references, many, of, these, references, come, from, aristotle, who, viewed, him, as, an, important, rival, in, the, field, of, natural, philosophy, he, was, known, in, antiquity, as, the, laughing, philosopher, because, of, his, emphasis, on, the, value, of, cheerfulness, democritus, was, born, in, abdera, on, the, coast, of, thrace, he, was, a, polymath, and, prolific, writer, producing, nearly, eighty, treatises, on, subjects, such, as, poetry, harmony, military, tactics, and, babylonian, theology, he, traveled, extensively, visiting, egypt, and, persia, but, wasn, t, particularly, impressed, by, these, countries, he, once, remarked, that, he, would, rather, uncover, a, single, scientific, explanation, than, become, the, king, of, persia, although, many, anecdotes, about, democritus, life, survive, their, authenticity, cannot, be, verified, and, modern, scholars, doubt, their, accuracy, ancient, accounts, of, his, life, have, claimed, that, he, lived, to, a, very, old, age, with, some, writers, claiming, that, he, was, over, a, hundred, years, old, at, the, time, of, his, death, democritus, wrote, on, ethics, as, well, as, physics, democritus, was, a, student, of, leucippus, early, sources, such, as, aristotle, and, theophrastus, credit, leucippus, with, creating, atomism, and, sharing, its, ideas, with, democritus, but, later, sources, credit, only, democritus, making, it, hard, to, distinguish, their, individual, contributions, we, have, various, quotes, from, democritus, on, atoms, one, of, them, being, diogenes, la, rtius, democritus, vol, ix, 44, now, his, principal, doctrines, were, these, that, atoms, and, the, vacuum, were, the, beginning, of, the, universe, and, that, everything, else, existed, only, in, opinion, trans, yonge, 1853, he, concluded, that, divisibility, of, matter, comes, to, an, end, and, the, smallest, possible, fragments, must, be, bodies, with, sizes, and, shapes, although, the, exact, argument, for, this, conclusion, of, his, is, not, known, the, smallest, and, indivisible, bodies, he, called, atoms, atoms, democritus, believed, are, too, small, to, be, detected, by, the, senses, they, are, infinite, in, numbers, and, come, in, infinitely, many, varieties, and, they, have, existed, forever, and, that, these, atoms, are, in, constant, motion, in, the, void, or, vacuum, the, middle, sized, objects, of, everyday, life, are, complexes, of, atoms, that, are, brought, together, by, random, collisions, differing, in, kind, based, on, the, variations, among, their, constituent, atoms, for, democritus, the, only, true, realities, are, atoms, and, the, void, what, we, perceive, as, water, fire, plants, or, humans, are, merely, combinations, of, atoms, in, the, void, the, sensory, qualities, we, experience, are, not, real, they, exist, only, by, convention, of, the, mass, of, atoms, democritus, said, the, more, any, indivisible, exceeds, the, heavier, it, is, however, his, exact, position, on, atomic, weight, is, disputed, his, exact, contributions, are, difficult, to, disentangle, from, those, of, his, mentor, leucippus, as, they, are, often, mentioned, together, in, texts, their, speculation, on, atoms, taken, from, leucippus, bears, a, passing, and, partial, resemblance, to, the, 19th, century, understanding, of, atomic, structure, that, has, led, some, to, regard, democritus, as, more, of, a, scientist, than, other, greek, philosophers, however, their, ideas, rested, on, very, different, bases, democritus, along, with, leucippus, and, epicurus, proposed, the, earliest, views, on, the, shapes, and, connectivity, of, atoms, they, reasoned, that, the, solidness, of, the, material, corresponded, to, the, shape, of, the, atoms, involved, using, analogies, from, humans, sense, experiences, he, gave, a, picture, or, an, image, of, an, atom, that, distinguished, them, from, each, other, by, their, shape, their, size, and, the, arrangement, of, their, parts, moreover, connections, were, explained, by, material, links, in, which, single, atoms, were, supplied, with, attachments, some, with, hooks, and, eyes, others, with, balls, and, sockets, the, democritean, atom, is, an, inert, solid, that, excludes, other, bodies, from, its, volume, and, interacts, with, other, atoms, mechanically, quantum, mechanical, atoms, are, similar, in, that, their, motion, can, be, described, by, mechanics, in, addition, to, their, electric, magnetic, and, quantum, interactions, they, are, different, in, that, they, can, be, split, into, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, the, elementary, particles, are, similar, to, democritean, atoms, in, that, they, are, indivisible, but, their, collisions, are, governed, purely, by, quantum, physics, fermions, observe, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, is, similar, to, the, democritean, principle, that, atoms, exclude, other, bodies, from, their, volume, however, bosons, do, not, with, the, prime, example, being, the, elementary, particle, photon, the, theory, of, the, atomists, appears, to, be, more, nearly, aligned, with, that, of, modern, science, than, any, other, theory, of, antiquity, however, the, similarity, with, modern, concepts, of, science, can, be, confusing, when, trying, to, understand, where, the, hypothesis, came, from, classical, atomists, could, not, have, had, an, empirical, basis, for, modern, concepts, of, atoms, and, molecules, the, atomistic, void, hypothesis, was, a, response, to, the, paradoxes, of, parmenides, and, zeno, the, founders, of, metaphysical, logic, who, put, forth, difficult, to, answer, arguments, in, favor, of, the, idea, that, there, can, be, no, movement, they, held, that, any, movement, would, require, a, void, which, is, nothing, but, a, nothing, cannot, exist, the, parmenidean, position, was, you, say, there, is, a, void, therefore, the, void, is, not, nothing, therefore, there, is, not, the, void, the, position, of, parmenides, appeared, validated, by, the, observation, that, where, there, seems, to, be, nothing, there, is, air, and, indeed, even, where, there, is, not, matter, there, is, something, for, instance, light, waves, the, atomists, agreed, that, motion, required, a, void, but, simply, rejected, the, argument, of, parmenides, on, the, grounds, that, motion, was, an, observable, fact, therefore, they, asserted, there, must, be, a, void, democritus, held, that, originally, the, universe, was, composed, of, nothing, but, tiny, atoms, churning, in, chaos, until, they, collided, together, to, form, larger, units, including, the, earth, and, everything, on, it, he, surmised, that, there, are, many, worlds, some, growing, some, decaying, some, with, no, sun, or, moon, some, with, several, he, held, that, every, world, has, a, beginning, and, an, end, and, that, a, world, could, be, destroyed, by, collision, with, another, world, democritus, was, also, a, pioneer, of, mathematics, and, geometry, in, particular, according, to, archimedes, democritus, was, among, the, first, to, observe, that, a, cone, and, pyramid, with, the, same, base, area, and, height, has, one, third, the, volume, of, a, cylinder, or, prism, respectively, a, result, which, archimedes, states, was, later, proved, by, eudoxus, of, cnidus, plutarch, also, reports, that, democritus, worked, on, a, problem, involving, the, cross, section, of, a, cone, that, thomas, heath, suggests, may, be, an, early, version, of, infinitesimal, calculus, democritus, thought, that, the, first, humans, lived, an, anarchic, and, animal, sort, of, life, foraging, individually, and, living, off, the, most, palatable, herbs, and, the, fruit, which, grew, wild, on, the, trees, until, fear, of, wild, animals, drove, them, together, into, societies, he, believed, that, these, early, people, had, no, language, but, that, they, gradually, began, to, articulate, their, expressions, establishing, symbols, for, every, sort, of, object, and, in, this, manner, came, to, understand, each, other, he, says, that, the, earliest, men, lived, laboriously, having, none, of, the, utilities, of, life, clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and, farming, were, unknown, to, them, democritus, presents, the, early, period, of, mankind, as, one, of, learning, by, trial, and, error, and, says, that, each, step, slowly, led, to, more, discoveries, they, took, refuge, in, the, caves, in, winter, stored, fruits, that, could, be, preserved, and, through, reason, and, keenness, of, mind, came, to, build, upon, each, new, idea, democritus, was, eloquent, on, ethical, topics, some, sixty, pages, of, his, fragments, as, recorded, in, diels, kranz, are, devoted, to, moral, counsel, the, ethics, and, politics, of, democritus, come, to, us, mostly, in, the, form, of, maxims, in, placing, the, quest, for, happiness, at, the, center, of, moral, philosophy, he, was, followed, by, almost, every, moralist, of, antiquity, the, most, common, maxims, associated, with, him, are, accept, favours, only, if, you, plan, to, do, greater, favours, in, return, and, he, is, also, believed, to, impart, some, controversial, advice, such, as, it, is, better, not, to, have, any, children, for, to, bring, them, up, well, takes, great, trouble, and, care, and, seeing, them, grow, up, badly, is, the, cruellest, of, all, pains, he, also, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, purpose, of, life, and, the, nature, of, happiness, he, held, that, happiness, was, not, to, be, found, in, riches, but, in, the, goods, of, the, soul, and, one, should, not, take, pleasure, in, mortal, things, another, saying, that, is, often, attributed, to, him, is, the, hopes, of, the, educated, were, better, than, the, riches, of, the, ignorant, he, also, stated, that, the, cause, of, sin, is, ignorance, of, what, is, better, which, become, a, central, notion, later, in, the, socratic, moral, thought, another, idea, he, propounded, which, was, later, echoed, in, the, socratic, moral, thought, was, the, maxim, that, you, are, better, off, being, wronged, than, doing, wrong, his, other, moral, notions, went, contrary, to, the, then, prevalent, views, such, as, his, idea, that, a, good, person, not, only, refrains, from, wrongdoing, but, does, not, even, want, to, do, wrong, for, the, generally, held, notion, back, then, was, that, virtue, reaches, it, apex, when, it, triumphs, over, conflicting, human, passions, later, greek, historians, consider, democritus, to, have, established, aesthetics, as, a, subject, of, investigation, and, study, as, he, wrote, theoretically, on, poetry, and, fine, art, long, before, authors, such, as, aristotle, specifically, thrasyllus, identified, six, works, in, the, philosopher, s, oeuvre, which, had, belonged, to, aesthetics, as, a, discipline, but, only, fragments, of, the, relevant, works, are, extant, hence, of, all, democritus, s, writings, on, these, matters, only, a, small, percentage, of, his, thoughts, and, ideas, can, be, known, diogenes, laertius, attributes, several, works, to, democritus, but, none, of, them, have, survived, in, a, complete, form, a, collections, of, sayings, credited, to, democritus, have, been, preserved, by, stobaeus, as, well, as, a, collection, of, sayings, ascribed, to, democrates, which, some, scholars, including, diels, and, kranz, have, also, ascribed, to, democritus, diogenes, laertius, claims, that, plato, disliked, democritus, so, much, that, he, wished, to, have, all, of, his, books, burned, he, was, nevertheless, well, known, to, his, fellow, northern, born, philosopher, aristotle, and, was, the, teacher, of, protagoras, democritus, is, evoked, by, english, writer, samuel, johnson, in, his, poem, the, vanity, of, human, wishes, 1749, ll, 49, 68, and, summoned, to, arise, on, earth, with, chearful, wisdom, and, instructive, mirth, see, motley, life, in, modern, trappings, dress, d, and, feed,
