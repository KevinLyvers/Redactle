selling, mandolins, 11, at, the, age, of, five, paganini, started, learning, the, mandolin, from, his, father, and, moved, to, the, violin, by, the, age, of, seven, his, musical, talents, were, quickly, recognized, earning, him, numerous, scholarships, for, violin, lessons, the, young, paganini, studied, under, various, local, violinists, including, giovanni, servetto, and, giacomo, costa, but, his, progress, quickly, outpaced, their, abilities, paganini, and, his, father, then, traveled, to, parma, to, seek, further, guidance, from, alessandro, rolla, but, upon, listening, to, paganini, s, playing, rolla, immediately, referred, him, to, his, own, teacher, ferdinando, paer, and, later, paer, s, own, teacher, gasparo, ghiretti, the, french, invaded, northern, italy, in, march, 1796, and, the, political, situation, in, genoa, became, unstable, the, paganinis, sought, refuge, in, their, country, property, in, romairone, near, bolzaneto, it, was, in, this, period, that, paganini, is, thought, to, have, developed, his, relationship, with, the, guitar, 18, he, mastered, the, guitar, but, preferred, to, play, it, in, exclusively, intimate, rather, than, public, concerts, he, later, described, the, guitar, as, his, constant, companion, on, his, concert, tours, by, 1800, paganini, and, his, father, traveled, to, livorno, where, paganini, played, in, concerts, and, his, father, resumed, his, maritime, work, in, 1801, the, 18, year, old, paganini, was, appointed, first, violin, of, the, republic, of, lucca, but, a, substantial, portion, of, his, income, came, from, freelancing, his, fame, as, a, violinist, was, matched, only, by, his, reputation, as, a, gambler, and, womanizer, in, 1805, lucca, was, annexed, by, napoleonic, france, and, the, region, was, ceded, to, napoleon, s, sister, elisa, bonaparte, paganini, became, a, violinist, for, the, baciocchi, court, while, giving, private, lessons, to, elisa, s, husband, felice, for, ten, years, during, this, time, his, wife, and, paganini, were, also, carrying, on, a, romantic, affair, in, 1807, baciocchi, became, the, grand, duchess, of, tuscany, and, her, court, was, transferred, to, florence, paganini, was, part, of, the, entourage, but, towards, the, end, of, 1809, he, left, baciocchi, to, resume, his, freelance, career, for, the, next, few, years, paganini, returned, to, touring, in, the, areas, surrounding, parma, and, genoa, though, he, was, very, popular, with, the, local, audience, he, was, still, not, very, well, known, in, the, rest, of, europe, his, first, break, came, from, an, 1813, concert, at, la, scala, in, milan, the, concert, was, a, great, success, as, a, result, paganini, began, to, attract, the, attention, of, other, prominent, though, more, conservative, musicians, across, europe, his, early, encounters, with, charles, philippe, lafont, and, louis, spohr, created, intense, rivalry, in, 1827, pope, leo, xii, honoured, paganini, with, the, order, of, the, golden, spur, his, fame, spread, across, europe, with, a, concert, tour, that, started, in, vienna, in, august, 1828, stopping, in, every, major, european, city, in, germany, poland, and, bohemia, until, february, 1831, in, strasbourg, this, was, followed, by, tours, in, paris, and, britain, his, technical, ability, and, his, willingness, to, display, it, received, much, critical, acclaim, in, addition, to, his, own, compositions, theme, and, variations, being, the, most, popular, paganini, also, performed, modified, versions, of, works, primarily, concertos, written, by, his, early, contemporaries, such, as, rodolphe, kreutzer, and, giovanni, battista, viotti, paganini, s, travels, also, brought, him, into, contact, with, eminent, guitar, virtuosi, of, the, day, including, ferdinando, carulli, in, paris, and, mauro, giuliani, in, vienna, throughout, his, life, paganini, was, no, stranger, to, chronic, illnesses, although, no, definite, medical, proof, exists, it, has, been, later, theorized, that, he, might, have, been, affected, by, marfan, syndrome, or, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, his, frequent, concert, schedule, as, well, as, his, extravagant, lifestyle, may, have, affected, his, health, paganini, was, diagnosed, with, syphilis, as, early, as, 1822, and, his, remedy, which, included, mercury, and, opium, came, with, serious, physical, and, psychological, side, effects, in, 1834, while, still, in, paris, he, was, treated, for, tuberculosis, in, september, 1834, paganini, put, an, end, to, his, concert, career, and, returned, to, genoa, contrary, to, popular, beliefs, involving, his, wishing, to, keep, his, music, and, techniques, secret, paganini, devoted, his, time, to, the, publication, of, his, compositions, and, violin, methods, he, accepted, students, of, whom, two, enjoyed, moderate, success, violinist, camillo, sivori, and, cellist, gaetano, ciandelli, neither, however, considered, paganini, helpful, or, inspirational, in, 1835, paganini, returned, to, parma, this, time, under, the, employ, of, archduchess, marie, louise, of, austria, napoleon, s, second, wife, he, was, in, charge, of, reorganizing, her, court, orchestra, but, he, eventually, conflicted, with, the, players, and, court, so, his, visions, never, saw, completion, in, paris, he, befriended, the, 11, year, old, polish, virtuoso, apollinaire, de, kontski, giving, him, some, lessons, and, a, signed, testimonial, it, was, widely, put, about, falsely, that, paganini, was, so, impressed, with, de, kontski, s, skills, that, he, bequeathed, him, his, violins, and, manuscripts, in, 1836, paganini, returned, to, paris, to, set, up, a, casino, its, immediate, failure, left, him, in, financial, ruin, and, he, auctioned, off, his, personal, effects, including, his, musical, instruments, to, recoup, his, losses, at, christmas, of, 1838, he, left, paris, for, marseille, and, after, a, brief, stay, traveled, to, nice, where, his, condition, worsened, in, may, 1840, the, bishop, of, nice, sent, paganini, a, local, parish, priest, to, perform, the, last, rites, paganini, assumed, the, sacrament, was, premature, and, refused, a, week, later, on, 27, may, 1840, the, 57, year, old, paganini, died, from, internal, hemorrhaging, before, a, priest, could, be, summoned, because, of, this, and, his, widely, rumored, association, with, the, devil, the, church, denied, his, body, a, catholic, burial, in, genoa, it, took, four, years, and, an, appeal, to, the, pope, before, the, church, let, his, body, be, transported, to, genoa, but, it, was, still, not, buried, his, body, was, finally, buried, in, 1876, in, a, cemetery, in, parma, in, 1893, the, czech, violinist, franti, ek, ond, ek, persuaded, paganini, s, grandson, attila, to, allow, a, viewing, of, the, violinist, s, body, after, this, episode, paganini, s, body, was, finally, reinterred, in, a, new, cemetery, in, parma, in, 1896, though, having, no, shortage, of, romantic, conquests, paganini, was, seriously, involved, with, a, singer, named, antonia, bianchi, from, como, whom, he, met, in, milan, in, 1813, the, two, gave, concerts, together, throughout, italy, they, had, a, son, achille, ciro, alessandro, born, on, 23, july, 1825, in, palermo, and, baptized, at, san, bartolomeo, s, they, never, legalized, their, union, and, it, ended, around, april, 1828, in, vienna, paganini, brought, achille, on, his, european, tours, and, achille, later, accompanied, his, father, until, the, latter, s, death, throughout, his, career, paganini, also, became, close, friends, with, composers, gioachino, rossini, and, hector, berlioz, rossini, and, paganini, met, in, bologna, in, the, summer, of, 1818, in, january, 1821, on, his, return, from, naples, paganini, met, rossini, again, in, rome, just, in, time, to, become, the, substitute, conductor, for, rossini, s, opera, matilde, di, shabran, upon, the, sudden, death, of, the, original, conductor, paganini, s, efforts, earned, great, gratitude, from, rossini, paganini, met, berlioz, in, paris, in, 1833, and, they, continued, to, correspond, he, commissioned, a, piece, from, the, composer, but, was, not, satisfied, with, the, resultant, four, movement, piece, for, orchestra, and, viola, obbligato, harold, en, italie, he, never, performed, it, instead, it, was, premiered, a, year, later, by, violist, christian, urhan, he, did, however, write, his, own, sonata, per, gran, viola, op, 35, with, orchestra, or, guitar, accompaniment, despite, his, alleged, lack, of, interest, in, harold, paganini, often, referred, to, berlioz, as, the, resurrection, of, beethoven, and, towards, the, end, of, his, life, he, gave, large, sums, to, the, composer, they, shared, an, active, interest, in, the, guitar, which, they, both, played, and, used, in, compositions, paganini, gave, berlioz, a, guitar, which, they, both, signed, on, its, sound, box, paganini, was, in, possession, of, a, number, of, fine, stringed, instruments, including, 11, stradivari, at, the, time, of, his, death, more, legendary, than, these, were, the, circumstances, under, which, he, obtained, and, lost, some, of, them, while, paganini, was, still, a, teenager, in, livorno, a, wealthy, businessman, named, livron, lent, him, a, violin, made, by, the, master, luthier, giuseppe, guarneri, for, a, concert, livron, was, so, impressed, with, paganini, s, playing, that, he, refused, to, take, it, back, this, particular, violin, came, to, be, known, as, il, cannone, guarnerius, the, cannon, of, guarnieri, because, of, its, powerful, voice, and, resonance, other, instruments, associated, with, paganini, include, the, antonio, amati, 1600, the, nicol, amati, 1657, the, paganini, desaint, 1680, stradivari, the, guarneri, filius, andrea, 1706, the, le, brun, 1712, stradivari, the, vuillaume, c, 1720, bergonzi, the, hubay, 1726, stradivari, and, the, comte, cozio, di, salabue, 1727, violins, the, countess, of,

and, the, grobert, of, mirecourt, 1820, guitar, of, his, guitars, there, is, little, evidence, remaining, of, his, various, choices, of, instrument, the, aforementioned, guitar, that, he, gave, to, berlioz, is, a, french, instrument, made, by, one, grobert, of, mirecourt, the, luthier, made, his, instrument, in, the, style, of, ren, lac, te, a, more, well, known, paris, based, guitar, maker, it, is, preserved, and, on, display, in, the, mus, e, de, la, musique, in, paris, of, the, guitars, he, owned, through, his, life, there, was, an, instrument, by, gennaro, fabricatore, that, he, had, refused, to, sell, even, in, his, periods, of, financial, stress, and, was, among, the, instruments, in, his, possession, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, israeli, violinist, ivry, gitlis, once, referred, to, paganini, as, a, phenomenon, rather, than, a, development, though, some, of, the, techniques, frequently, employed, by, paganini, were, already, present, most, accomplished, violinists, of, the, time, focused, on, intonation, and, bowing, techniques, arcangelo, corelli, 1653, 1713, was, considered, a, pioneer, in, transforming, the, violin, from, an, ensemble, instrument, to, a, solo, instrument, other, notable, violinists, included, antonio, vivaldi, 1678, 1741, and, giuseppe, tartini, 1692, 1770, who, in, their, compositions, reflected, the, increasing, technical, and, musical, demands, on, the, violinist, although, the, role, of, the, violin, in, music, drastically, changed, through, this, period, progress, in, violin, technique, was, steady, but, slow, much, of, paganini, s, playing, and, his, violin, composition, was, influenced, by, two, violinists, pietro, locatelli, 1693, 1746, and, august, duranowski, auguste, fr, d, ric, durand, 1770, 1834, during, paganini, s, study, in, parma, he, came, across, the, 24, caprices, of, locatelli, entitled, l, arte, di, nuova, modulazione, capricci, enigmatici, or, the, art, of, the, new, style, the, enigmatic, caprices, published, in, the, 1730s, they, were, shunned, by, the, musical, authorities, for, their, technical, innovations, and, were, forgotten, by, the, musical, community, at, large, around, the, same, time, durand, a, former, student, of, giovanni, battista, viotti, 1755, 1824, became, a, celebrated, violinist, he, was, renowned, for, his, use, of, harmonics, both, natural, and, artificial, which, had, previously, not, been, attempted, in, performance, and, the, left, hand, pizzicato, in, his, performance, paganini, was, impressed, by, durand, s, innovations, and, showmanship, which, later, also, became, the, hallmarks, of, the, young, violin, virtuoso, paganini, was, instrumental, in, the, revival, and, popularization, of, these, violinistic, techniques, another, aspect, of, paganini, s, violin, techniques, concerned, his, flexibility, he, had, exceptionally, long, fingers, and, was, capable, of, playing, three, octaves, across, four, strings, in, a, hand, span, an, extraordinary, feat, even, by, today, s, standards, paganini, composed, his, own, works, to, play, exclusively, in, his, concerts, all, of, which, profoundly, influenced, the, evolution, of, violin, technique, his, 24, caprices, were, likely, composed, between, 1805, and, 1809, while, he, was, in, the, service, of, the, baciocchi, court, also, during, this, period, he, composed, the, majority, of, the, solo, pieces, duo, sonatas, trios, and, quartets, for, the, guitar, either, as, a, solo, instrument, or, with, strings, these, chamber, works, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, publication, in, lucca, of, the, guitar, quintets, of, boccherini, many, of, his, variations, including, le, streghe, the, carnival, of, venice, and, nel, cor, pi, non, mi, sento, were, composed, or, at, least, first, performed, before, his, european, concert, tour, his, six, violin, concertos, were, written, between, 1817, and, 1830, generally, speaking, paganini, s, compositions, were, technically, imaginative, and, the, timbre, of, the, instrument, was, greatly, expanded, as, a, result, of, these, works, sounds, of, different, musical, instruments, and, animals, were, often, imitated, one, such, composition, was, titled, il, fandango, spanolo, the, spanish, dance, which, featured, a, series, of, humorous, imitations, of, farm, animals, even, more, outrageous, was, a, solo, piece, duetto, amoroso, in, which, the, sighs, and, groans, of, lovers, were, intimately, depicted, on, the, violin, there, survives, a, manuscript, of, the, duetto, which, has, been, recorded, the, existence, of, the, fandango, is, known, only, through, concert, posters, eug, ne, ysa, e, criticized, paganini, s, works, for, lacking, characteristics, of, true, polyphonism, yehudi, menuhin, on, the, other, hand, suggested, that, this, might, have, been, the, result, of, paganini, s, reliance, on, the, guitar, in, lieu, of, the, piano, as, an, aid, in, composition, the, orchestral, parts, for, his, concertos, were, often, polite, unadventurous, and, clearly, supportive, of, the, soloist, in, this, his, style, is, consistent, with, that, of, other, italian, composers, such, as, giovanni, paisiello, gioachino, rossini, and, gaetano, donizetti, who, were, influenced, by, the, guitar, song, milieu, of, naples, during, this, period, paganini, s, la, campanella, and, the, a, minor, caprice, no, 24, have, inspired, many, composers, including, franz, liszt, robert, schumann, johannes, brahms, sergei, rachmaninoff, boris, blacher, andrew, lloyd, webber, george, rochberg, and, witold, lutos, awski, all, of, whom, wrote, variations, on, these, works, notable, works, inspired, by, compositions, of, paganini, include, the, caprice, no, 24, in, a, minor, op, 1, tema, con, variazioni, has, been, the, basis, of, works, by, many, other, composers, notable, examples, include, brahms, s, variations, on, a, theme, of, paganini, and, rachmaninoff, s, rhapsody, on, a, theme, of, paganini, in, 1904, the, genoa, conservatory, was, renamed, the, conservatorio, niccol, paganini, in, honor, of, the, composer, the, conservatory, is, also, host, to, the, paganini, competition, premio, paganini, an, international, violin, competition, created, in, 1954, in, 1972, the, state, of, italy, purchased, a, large, collection, of, niccol, paganini, manuscripts, from, the, w, heyer,
