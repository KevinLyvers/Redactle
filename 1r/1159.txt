land, in, 1270, he, was, on, his, way, home, in, 1272, when, he, was, informed, of, his, father, s, death, making, a, slow, return, he, reached, england, in, 1274, and, was, crowned, at, westminster, abbey, edward, spent, much, of, his, reign, reforming, royal, administration, and, common, law, through, an, extensive, legal, inquiry, he, investigated, the, tenure, of, several, feudal, liberties, the, law, was, reformed, through, a, series, of, statutes, regulating, criminal, and, property, law, but, the, king, s, attention, was, increasingly, drawn, towards, military, affairs, after, suppressing, a, minor, conflict, in, wales, in, 1276, 77, edward, responded, to, a, second, one, in, 1282, 83, by, conquering, wales, he, then, established, english, rule, built, castles, and, towns, in, the, countryside, and, settled, them, with, english, people, after, the, death, of, the, heir, to, the, scottish, throne, edward, was, invited, to, arbitrate, a, succession, dispute, he, claimed, feudal, suzerainty, over, scotland, and, invaded, the, country, and, the, ensuing, first, scottish, war, of, independence, continued, after, his, death, simultaneously, edward, found, himself, at, war, with, france, a, scottish, ally, after, king, philip, iv, confiscated, the, duchy, of, gascony, the, duchy, was, eventually, recovered, but, the, conflict, relieved, english, military, pressure, against, scotland, by, the, mid, 1290s, extensive, military, campaigns, required, high, levels, of, taxation, and, this, met, with, both, lay, and, ecclesiastical, opposition, in, england, in, ireland, he, had, extracted, soldiers, supplies, and, money, leaving, decay, lawlessness, and, a, revival, of, the, fortunes, of, his, enemies, in, gaelic, territories, when, the, king, died, in, 1307, he, left, to, his, son, edward, ii, a, war, with, scotland, and, other, financial, and, political, burdens, edward, s, temperamental, nature, and, height, 6, 2, 188, cm, made, him, an, intimidating, figure, he, often, instilled, fear, in, his, contemporaries, although, he, held, the, respect, of, his, subjects, for, the, way, he, embodied, the, medieval, ideal, of, kingship, as, a, soldier, an, administrator, and, a, man, of, faith, modern, historians, are, divided, in, their, assessment, of, edward, some, have, praised, him, for, his, contribution, to, the, law, and, administration, but, others, have, criticised, his, uncompromising, attitude, towards, his, nobility, edward, is, credited, with, many, accomplishments, including, restoring, royal, authority, after, the, reign, of, henry, iii, and, establishing, parliament, as, a, permanent, institution, which, allowed, for, a, functional, system, for, raising, taxes, and, reforming, the, law, through, statutes, at, the, same, time, he, is, also, often, condemned, for, vindictiveness, opportunism, and, untrustworthiness, in, his, dealings, with, wales, and, scotland, coupled, with, a, colonialist, approach, to, their, governance, and, to, ireland, and, for, antisemitic, policies, leading, to, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, from, england, in, 1290, edward, was, born, at, the, palace, of, westminster, on, the, night, of, 17, 18, june, 1239, to, king, henry, iii, and, eleanor, of, provence, edward, an, anglo, saxon, name, was, not, commonly, given, among, the, aristocracy, of, england, after, the, norman, conquest, but, henry, was, devoted, to, the, veneration, of, edward, the, confessor, and, decided, to, name, his, firstborn, son, after, the, saint, edward, s, birth, was, widely, celebrated, at, the, royal, court, and, throughout, england, and, he, was, baptised, three, days, later, at, westminster, abbey, he, was, commonly, referred, to, as, the, lord, edward, until, his, accession, to, the, throne, in, 1272, among, his, childhood, friends, was, his, cousin, henry, of, almain, son, of, king, henry, s, brother, richard, of, cornwall, henry, of, almain, remained, a, close, companion, of, the, prince, for, the, rest, of, his, life, edward, was, placed, in, the, care, of, hugh, giffard, father, of, the, future, chancellor, godfrey, giffard, until, bartholomew, pecche, took, over, at, giffard, s, death, in, 1246, edward, received, an, education, typical, of, an, aristocratic, boy, his, age, including, in, military, studies, although, the, details, of, his, upbringing, are, unknown, there, were, concerns, about, edward, s, health, as, a, child, and, he, fell, ill, in, 1246, 1247, and, 1251, nonetheless, he, grew, up, to, become, a, strong, athletic, and, imposing, man, at, 6, ft, 2, in, 188, cm, he, towered, over, most, of, his, contemporaries, hence, his, epithet, longshanks, meaning, long, legs, or, long, shins, the, historian, michael, prestwich, states, that, his, long, arms, gave, him, an, advantage, as, a, swordsman, long, thighs, one, as, a, horseman, in, youth, his, curly, hair, was, blond, in, maturity, it, darkened, and, in, old, age, it, turned, white, the, regularity, of, his, features, was, marred, by, a, drooping, left, eyelid, his, speech, despite, a, lisp, was, said, to, be, persuasive, in, 1254, english, fears, of, a, castilian, invasion, of, the, english, held, province, of, gascony, induced, king, henry, to, arrange, a, politically, expedient, marriage, between, fifteen, year, old, edward, and, thirteen, year, old, eleanor, the, half, sister, of, king, alfonso, x, of, castile, they, were, married, on, 1, november, 1254, in, the, abbey, of, santa, mar, a, la, real, de, las, huelgas, in, castile, as, part, of, the, marriage, agreement, alfonso, x, gave, up, his, claims, to, gascony, and, edward, received, grants, of, land, worth, 15, 000, marks, a, year, the, marriage, eventually, led, to, the, english, acquisition, of, ponthieu, in, 1279, upon, eleanor, s, inheritance, of, the, county, henry, made, sizeable, endowments, to, edward, in, 1254, including, gascony, most, of, ireland, which, was, granted, to, edward, while, making, the, claim, for, the, first, time, that, dominion, of, ireland, would, never, be, separated, from, the, english, crown, and, much, land, in, wales, and, england, including, the, earldom, of, chester, they, offered, edward, little, independence, for, henry, retained, much, control, over, the, land, in, question, particularly, in, ireland, and, benefited, from, most, of, the, income, from, those, lands, split, control, caused, problems, between, 1254, and, 1272, eleven, different, justiciars, were, appointed, to, head, the, irish, government, encouraging, further, conflict, and, instability, corruption, rose, to, very, high, levels, in, gascony, simon, de, montfort, 6th, earl, of, leicester, had, been, appointed, as, royal, lieutenant, in, 1253, and, drew, its, income, so, in, practice, edward, derived, neither, authority, nor, revenue, from, this, province, around, the, end, of, november, 1254, edward, and, eleanor, left, castile, and, entered, gascony, where, they, were, warmly, received, by, the, populace, here, edward, styled, himself, as, ruling, gascony, as, prince, and, lord, a, move, that, the, historian, j, s, hamilton, states, was, a, show, of, his, blooming, political, independence, from, 1254, to, 1257, edward, was, under, the, influence, of, his, mother, s, relatives, known, as, the, savoyards, the, most, notable, of, whom, was, peter, ii, of, savoy, the, queen, s, uncle, after, 1257, edward, became, increasingly, close, to, the, lusignan, faction, the, half, brothers, of, his, father, henry, iii, led, by, such, men, as, william, de, valence, this, association, was, significant, because, the, two, groups, of, privileged, foreigners, were, resented, by, the, established, english, aristocracy, who, would, be, at, the, centre, of, the, ensuing, years, baronial, reform, movement, edward, s, ties, to, his, lusignan, kinsmen, were, viewed, unfavourably, by, contemporaries, including, the, chronicler, matthew, paris, who, circulated, tales, of, unruly, and, violent, conduct, by, edward, s, inner, circle, which, raised, questions, about, his, personal, qualities, edward, showed, independence, in, political, matters, as, early, as, 1255, when, he, sided, with, the, soler, family, in, gascony, in, their, conflict, with, the, colomb, family, this, ran, contrary, to, his, father, s, policy, of, mediation, between, the, local, factions, in, may, 1258, a, group, of, magnates, drew, up, a, document, for, reform, of, the, king, s, government, the, so, called, provisions, of, oxford, largely, directed, against, the, lusignans, edward, stood, by, his, political, allies, and, strongly, opposed, the, provisions, the, reform, movement, succeeded, in, limiting, the, lusignan, influence, and, edward, s, attitude, gradually, changed, in, march, 1259, he, entered, into, a, formal, alliance, with, one, of, the, main, reformers, richard, de, clare, 6th, earl, of, gloucester, and, on, 15, october, announced, that, he, supported, the, barons, goals, and, their, leader, the, earl, of, leicester, the, motive, behind, edward, s, change, of, heart, could, have, been, purely, pragmatic, the, earl, of, leicester, was, in, a, good, position, to, support, his, cause, in, gascony, when, the, king, left, for, france, in, november, edward, s, behaviour, turned, into, pure, insubordination, he, made, several, appointments, to, advance, the, cause, of, the, reformers, and, his, father, believed, that, edward, was, considering, a, coup, d, tat, when, henry, returned, from, france, he, initially, refused, to, see, his, son, but, through, the, mediation, of, richard, of, cornwall, and, boniface, archbishop, of, canterbury, the, two, were, eventually, reconciled, edward, was, sent, abroad, to, france, and, in, november, 1260, he, again, united, with, the, lusignans, who, had, been, exiled, there, back, in, england, early, in, 1262, edward, fell, out, with, some, of, his, former, lusignan, allies, over, financial, matters, the, next, year, king, henry, sent, him, on, a, campaign, in, wales, against, the, welsh, prince, llywelyn, ap, gruffudd, but, edward, s, forces, were, besieged, in, northern, wales, and, achieved, only, limited, results, around, the, same, time, leicester, who, had, been, out, of, the, country, since, 1261, returned, to, england, and, reignited, the, baronial, reform, movement, as, the, king, seemed, ready, to, give, in, to, the, barons, demands, edward, began, to, take, control, of, the, situation, from, his, previously, unpredictable, and, equivocating, attitude, he, changed, to, one, of, firm, devotion, to, protection, of, his, father, s, royal, rights, he, reunited, with, some, of, the, men, he, had, alienated, the, year, before, including, henry, of, almain, and, john, de, warenne, 6th, earl, of, surrey, and, retook, windsor, castle, from, the, rebels, through, the, arbitration, of, king, louis, ix, of, france, an, agreement, was, made, between, the, two, parties, this, mise, of, amiens, was, largely, favourable, to, the, royalist, side, and, would, cause, further, conflict, the, years, 1264, 1267, saw, the, conflict, known, as, the, second, barons, war, in, which, baronial, forces, led, by, the, earl, of, leicester, fought, against, those, who, remained, loyal, to, the, king, edward, initiated, the, armed, conflict, by, capturing, the, rebel, held, city, of, gloucester, when, robert, de, ferrers, 6th, earl, of, derby, came, to, the, assistance, of, the, baronial, forces, edward, negotiated, a, truce, with, the, earl, edward, later, broke, the, terms, of, the, agreement, he, then, captured, northampton, from, simon, de, montfort, the, younger, before, embarking, on, a, retaliatory, campaign, against, derby, s, lands, the, baronial, and, royalist, forces, met, at, the, battle, of, lewes, on, 14, may, 1264, edward, commanding, the, right, wing, performed, well, and, soon, defeated, the, london, contingent, of, the, earl, of, leicester, s, forces, unwisely, he, pursued, the, scattered, enemy, and, on, his, return, found, the, rest, of, the, royal, army, defeated, by, the, mise, of, lewes, edward, and, his, cousin, henry, of, almain, were, given, up, as, hostages, to, leicester, edward, remained, in, captivity, until, march, 1265, and, even, after, his, release, he, was, kept, under, strict, surveillance, in, hereford, he, escaped, on, 28, may, while, out, riding, and, joined, up, with, gilbert, de, clare, 7th, earl, of, gloucester, who, had, recently, defected, to, the, king, s, side, the, earl, of, leicester, s, support, was, now, dwindling, and, edward, retook, worcester, and, gloucester, with, little, effort, meanwhile, leicester, had, made, an, alliance, with, llywelyn, and, started, moving, east, to, join, forces, with, his, son, simon, edward, made, a, surprise, attack, at, kenilworth, castle, where, the, younger, montfort, was, quartered, before, moving, on, to, cut, off, the, earl, of, leicester, the, two, forces, then, met, at, the, battle, of, evesham, on, 4, august, 1265, the, earl, of, leicester, stood, little, chance, against, the, superior, royal, forces, and, after, his, defeat, he, was, killed, and, mutilated, on, the, field, through, such, episodes, as, the, deception, of, derby, at, gloucester, edward, acquired, a, reputation, as, untrustworthy, during, the, summer, campaign, he, began, to, learn, from, his, mistakes, and, gained, the, respect, and, admiration, of, contemporaries, through, actions, such, as, showing, clemency, towards, his, enemies, the, war, did, not, end, with, the, earl, of, leicester, s, death, and, edward, participated, in, the, continued, campaigning, at, christmas, he, came, to, terms, with, simon, the, younger, and, his, associates, at, the, isle, of, axholme, in, lincolnshire, and, in, march, he, led, a, successful, assault, on, the, cinque, ports, a, contingent, of, rebels, held, out, in, the, virtually, impregnable, kenilworth, castle, and, did, not, surrender, until, the, drafting, of, the, conciliatory, dictum, of, kenilworth, in, october, 1266, in, april, it, seemed, as, if, the, earl, of, gloucester, would, take, up, the, cause, of, the, reform, movement, and, civil, war, would, resume, but, after, a, renegotiation, of, the, terms, of, the, dictum, of, kenilworth, the, parties, came, to, an, agreement, around, this, time, edward, was, made, steward, of, england, and, began, to, exercise, influence, in, the, government, he, was, also, appointed, lord, warden, of, the, cinque, ports, in, 1265, despite, this, he, was, little, involved, in, the, settlement, negotiations, following, the, wars, his, main, focus, was, on, planning, his, forthcoming, crusade, edward, pledged, himself, to, undertake, a, crusade, in, an, elaborate, ceremony, on, 24, june, 1268, with, his, brother, edmund, crouchback, and, cousin, henry, of, almain, some, of, edward, s, former, adversaries, such, as, john, de, vescy, and, the, 7th, earl, of, gloucester, similarly, committed, themselves, although, some, like, gloucester, did, not, ultimately, participate, with, the, country, pacified, the, greatest, impediment, to, the, project, was, acquiring, sufficient, finances, king, louis, ix, of, france, who, was, the, leader, of, the, crusade, provided, a, loan, of, about, 17, 500, this, was, not, enough, and, the, rest, had, to, be, raised, through, a, direct, tax, on, the, laity, which, had, not, been, levied, since, 1237, in, may, 1270, parliament, granted, a, tax, of, one, twentieth, of, all, movable, property, in, exchange, the, king, agreed, to, reconfirm, magna, carta, and, to, impose, restrictions, on, jewish, money, lending, on, 20, august, edward, sailed, from, dover, for, france, historians, have, not, determined, the, size, of, his, accompanying, force, with, any, certainty, but, it, was, probably, fewer, than, 1000, men, including, around, 225, knights, originally, the, crusaders, intended, to, relieve, the, beleaguered, christian, stronghold, of, acre, in, palestine, but, king, louis, and, his, brother, charles, of, anjou, the, king, of, sicily, decided, to, attack, the, emirate, of, tunis, to, establish, a, stronghold, in, north, africa, the, plans, failed, when, the, french, forces, were, struck, by, an, epidemic, which, on, 25, august, killed, louis, himself, by, the, time, edward, arrived, at, tunis, charles, had, already, signed, a, treaty, with, the, emir, and, there, was, little, to, do, but, return, to, sicily, further, military, action, was, postponed, until, the, following, spring, but, a, devastating, storm, off, the, coast, of, sicily, dissuaded, both, charles, and, philip, iii, louis, s, successor, from, any, further, campaigning, edward, decided, to, continue, alone, and, on, 9, may, 1271, he, finally, landed, at, acre, the, christian, situation, in, the, holy, land, was, precarious, jerusalem, had, been, reconquered, by, the, muslims, in, 1244, and, acre, was, now, the, centre, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, the, muslim, states, were, on, the, offensive, under, the, mamluk, leadership, of, baibars, and, were, threatening, acre, though, edward, s, men, were, an, important, addition, to, the, garrison, they, stood, little, chance, against, baibars, s, superior, forces, and, an, initial, raid, at, nearby, st, georges, de, lebeyne, in, june, was, largely, futile, an, embassy, to, the, ilkhan, abaqa, of, the, mongols, helped, bring, about, an, attack, on, aleppo, in, the, north, which, distracted, baibars, s, forces, the, mongol, invasion, ultimately, failed, in, november, edward, led, a, raid, on, qaqun, which, could, have, served, as, a, bridgehead, to, jerusalem, but, this, was, unsuccessful, the, situation, in, acre, grew, desperate, and, in, may, 1272, hugh, iii, of, cyprus, who, was, the, nominal, king, of, jerusalem, signed, a, ten, year, truce, with, baibars, edward, was, initially, defiant, but, in, june, 1272, he, was, the, victim, of, an, assassination, attempt, by, a, member, of, the, syrian, order, of, assassins, supposedly, ordered, by, baibars, although, he, managed, to, kill, the, assassin, he, was, struck, in, the, arm, by, a, dagger, feared, to, be, poisoned, and, was, severely, weakened, over, the, following, months, this, finally, persuaded, edward, to, abandon, the, campaign, it, was, not, until, 24, september, 1272, that, edward, left, acre, shortly, after, arriving, in, sicily, he, was, met, with, the, news, that, his, father, had, died, on, 16, november, edward, was, deeply, saddened, by, this, news, but, rather, than, hurrying, home, at, once, he, made, a, leisurely, journey, northwards, this, was, due, partly, to, his, still, poor, health, but, also, to, a, lack, of, urgency, the, political, situation, in, england, was, stable, after, the, mid, century, upheavals, and, edward, was, proclaimed, king, after, his, father, s, death, rather, than, at, his, own, coronation, as, had, until, then, been, customary, in, edward, s, absence, the, country, was, governed, by, a, royal, council, led, by, robert, burnell, edward, passed, through, italy, and, france, visiting, pope, gregory, x, and, paying, homage, to, philip, iii, in, paris, for, his, french, domains, edward, travelled, by, way, of, savoy, to, receive, homage, from, his, great, uncle, count, philip, i, for, castles, in, the, alps, held, by, a, treaty, of, 1246, edward, then, journeyed, to, gascony, to, order, its, affairs, and, put, down, a, revolt, headed, by, gaston, de, b, arn, while, there, he, launched, an, investigation, into, his, feudal, possessions, which, as, hamilton, puts, it, reflects, edward, s, keen, interest, in, administrative, efficiency, reinforced, edward, s, position, as, lord, in, aquitaine, and, strengthened, the, bonds, of, loyalty, between, the, king, duke, and, his, subjects, around, the, same, time, the, king, organised, political, alliances, with, the, kingdoms, in, iberia, his, four, year, old, daughter, eleanor, was, promised, in, marriage, to, alfonso, the, heir, to, the, crown, of, aragon, and, edward, s, heir, henry, was, betrothed, to, joan, heiress, to, the, kingdom, of, navarre, neither, union, would, come, to, fruition, only, on, 2, august, 1274, did, edward, return, to, england, landing, at, dover, the, thirty, five, year, old, king, held, his, coronation, on, 19, august, at, westminster, abbey, alongside, queen, eleanor, immediately, after, being, anointed, and, crowned, by, robert, kilwardby, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, edward, removed, his, crown, saying, that, he, did, not, intend, to, wear, it, again, until, he, had, recovered, all, the, crown, lands, that, his, father, had, surrendered, during, his, reign, llywelyn, ap, gruffudd, enjoyed, an, advantageous, situation, in, the, aftermath, of, the, barons, war, the, 1267, treaty, of, montgomery, recognised, his, ownership, of, land, he, had, conquered, in, the, four, cantrefs, of, perfeddwlad, and, his, title, of, prince, of, wales, armed, conflicts, nevertheless, continued, in, particular, with, certain, dissatisfied, marcher, lords, such, as, the, earl, of, gloucester, roger, mortimer, and, humphrey, de, bohun, 3rd, earl, of, hereford, problems, were, exacerbated, when, llywelyn, s, younger, brother, dafydd, and, gruffydd, ap, gwenwynwyn, of, powys, after, failing, in, an, assassination, attempt, against, llywelyn, defected, to, the, english, in, 1274, citing, ongoing, hostilities, and, edward, s, harbouring, of, his, enemies, llywelyn, refused, to, do, homage, to, the, king, for, edward, a, further, provocation, came, from, llywelyn, s, planned, marriage, to, eleanor, daughter, of, simon, de, montfort, the, elder, in, november, 1276, edward, declared, war, initial, operations, were, launched, under, the, captaincy, of, mortimer, edward, s, brother, edmund, earl, of, lancaster, and, william, de, beauchamp, 9th, earl, of, warwick, support, for, llywelyn, was, weak, among, his, own, countrymen, in, july, 1277, edward, invaded, with, a, force, of, 15, 500, of, whom, 9, 000, were, welshmen, the, campaign, never, came, to, a, major, battle, and, llywelyn, soon, realised, he, had, no, choice, but, to, surrender, by, the, treaty, of, aberconwy, in, november, 1277, he, was, left, only, with, the, land, of, gwynedd, though, he, was, allowed, to, retain, the, title, of, prince, of, wales, when, war, broke, out, again, in, 1282, it, was, an, entirely, different, undertaking, for, the, welsh, this, war, was, over, national, identity, and, the, right, to, traditional, welsh, law, enjoying, wide, support, provoked, by, attempts, to, abuse, the, english, legal, system, to, dispossess, prominent, welsh, landowners, many, of, whom, were, edward, s, former, opponents, for, edward, it, became, a, war, of, conquest, aimed, to, put, an, end, finally, to, the, malice, of, the, welsh, the, war, started, with, a, rebellion, by, dafydd, who, was, discontented, with, the, reward, he, had, received, from, edward, in, 1277, llywelyn, and, other, welsh, chieftains, soon, joined, in, and, initially, the, welsh, experienced, military, success, in, june, gloucester, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, llandeilo, fawr, on, 6, november, while, john, peckham, archbishop, of, canterbury, was, conducting, peace, negotiations, edward, s, commander, of, anglesey, luke, de, tany, decided, to, carry, out, a, surprise, attack, a, pontoon, bridge, had, been, built, to, the, mainland, but, shortly, after, tany, and, his, men, crossed, over, they, were, ambushed, by, the, welsh, and, suffered, heavy, losses, at, the, battle, of, moel, y, don, the, welsh, advances, ended, on, 11, december, when, llywelyn, was, lured, into, a, trap, and, killed, at, the, battle, of, orewin, bridge, the, conquest, of, gwynedd, was, complete, with, the, capture, in, june, 1283, of, dafydd, who, was, taken, to, shrewsbury, and, executed, as, a, traitor, the, following, autumn, edward, ordered, dafydd, s, head, to, be, publicly, exhibited, on, london, bridge, by, the, 1284, statute, of, rhuddlan, the, principality, of, wales, was, incorporated, into, england, and, was, given, an, administrative, system, like, the, english, with, counties, policed, by, sheriffs, english, law, was, introduced, in, criminal, cases, though, the, welsh, were, allowed, to, maintain, their, own, customary, laws, in, some, cases, of, property, disputes, after, 1277, and, increasingly, after, 1283, edward, embarked, on, a, project, of, english, settlement, of, wales, creating, new, towns, like, flint, aberystwyth, and, rhuddlan, their, new, residents, were, english, migrants, the, local, welsh, being, banned, from, living, inside, them, and, many, were, protected, by, extensive, walls, an, extensive, project, of, castle, building, was, also, initiated, under, the, direction, of, james, of, saint, george, a, prestigious, architect, whom, edward, had, met, in, savoy, on, his, return, from, the, crusade, these, included, the, beaumaris, caernarfon, conwy, and, harlech, castles, intended, to, act, as, fortresses, royal, palaces, and, as, the, new, centres, of, civilian, and, judicial, administration, his, programme, of, castle, building, in, wales, heralded, the, introduction, of, the, widespread, use, of, arrowslits, in, castle, walls, across, europe, drawing, on, eastern, architectural, influences, also, a, product, of, the, crusades, was, the, introduction, of, the, concentric, castle, and, four, of, the, eight, castles, edward, founded, in, wales, followed, this, design, the, castles, drew, on, imagery, associated, with, the, byzantine, empire, and, king, arthur, in, an, attempt, to, build, legitimacy, for, his, new, regime, and, they, made, a, clear, statement, about, edward, s, intention, to, rule, wales, permanently, the, welsh, aristocracy, were, nearly, wholly, dispossessed, of, their, lands, edward, was, the, greatest, beneficiary, of, this, process, further, rebellions, occurred, in, 1287, 88, and, more, seriously, in, 1294, under, the, leadership, of, madog, ap, llywelyn, a, distant, relative, of, llywelyn, ap, gruffudd, the, causes, included, deep, resentment, at, the, occupation, poor, colonial, style, governance, and, very, heavy, taxation, this, last, conflict, demanded, the, king, s, own, attention, but, in, both, cases, the, rebellions, were, put, down, the, revolt, was, followed, by, immediate, punitive, measures, including, taking, 200, hostages, measures, to, stop, the, welsh, from, bearing, arms, or, residing, in, the, new, boroughs, probably, date, from, this, time, and, the, welsh, administration, continued, to, be, nearly, wholly, imported, in, 1284, king, edward, had, his, son, edward, later, edward, ii, born, at, caernarfon, castle, probably, to, make, a, deliberate, statement, about, the, new, political, order, in, wales, in, 1301, at, lincoln, the, young, edward, became, the, first, english, prince, to, be, invested, with, the, title, of, prince, of, wales, when, the, king, granted, him, the, earldom, of, chester, and, lands, across, north, wales, hoping, to, give, his, son, more, financial, independence, edward, began, a, more, concilatory, policy, to, rebuild, systems, of, patronage, and, service, particularly, through, his, son, as, prince, of, wales, but, wales, remained, politically, volatile, and, a, deep, divide, and, distrust, remained, between, the, english, settlers, and, the, welsh, edward, never, again, went, on, crusade, after, his, return, to, england, in, 1274, but, he, maintained, an, intention, to, do, so, and, in, 1287, took, a, vow, to, go, on, another, crusade, this, intention, guided, much, of, his, foreign, policy, until, at, least, 1291, to, stage, a, european, wide, crusade, it, was, essential, to, prevent, conflict, between, the, sovereigns, on, the, continent, a, major, obstacle, to, this, was, represented, by, the, conflict, between, the, french, capetian, house, of, anjou, ruling, southern, italy, and, the, crown, of, aragon, in, spain, in, 1282, the, citizens, of, palermo, rose, up, against, charles, of, anjou, and, turned, for, help, to, peter, iii, of, aragon, in, what, has, become, known, as, the, sicilian, vespers, in, the, war, that, followed, charles, of, anjou, s, son, charles, of, salerno, was, taken, prisoner, by, the, aragonese, the, french, began, planning, an, attack, on, aragon, raising, the, prospect, of, a, large, scale, european, war, to, edward, it, was, imperative, that, such, a, war, be, avoided, and, in, paris, in, 1286, he, brokered, a, truce, between, france, and, aragon, that, helped, secure, charles, s, release, as, far, as, the, crusades, were, concerned, edward, s, efforts, proved, ineffective, a, devastating, blow, to, his, plans, came, in, 1291, when, the, mamluks, captured, acre, the, last, christian, stronghold, in, the, holy, land, edward, had, long, been, deeply, involved, in, the, affairs, of, his, own, duchy, of, gascony, in, 1278, he, assigned, an, investigating, commission, to, his, trusted, associates, otto, de, grandson, and, the, chancellor, robert, burnell, which, caused, the, replacement, of, the, seneschal, luke, de, tany, in, 1286, edward, visited, the, region, himself, and, stayed, for, almost, three, years, on, easter, sunday, 1287, edward, was, standing, in, a, tower, when, the, floor, collapsed, he, fell, 80, feet, broke, his, collarbone, and, was, confined, to, bed, for, several, months, several, others, died, soon, after, he, regained, his, health, he, ordered, the, local, jews, expelled, from, gascony, seemingly, as, a, thank, offering, for, his, recovery, the, perennial, problem, was, the, status, of, gascony, within, the, kingdom, of, france, and, edward, s, role, as, the, french, king, s, vassal, on, his, diplomatic, mission, in, 1286, edward, had, paid, homage, to, the, new, king, philip, iv, and, following, an, outbreak, of, piracy, and, informal, war, between, english, gascon, norman, and, french, sailors, in, 1293, his, brother, edmund, crouchback, even, went, so, far, as, to, allow, philip, iv, s, occupation, of, gascony, s, chief, fortresses, as, a, show, of, good, faith, that, edward, had, not, intended, the, seizure, of, several, french, ships, or, the, sacking, of, the, french, port, of, la, rochelle, philip, however, refused, to, release, the, fortresses, and, declared, gascony, forfeit, when, edward, refused, to, appear, before, him, again, in, paris, correspondence, between, edward, and, the, mongol, court, of, the, east, continued, during, this, time, diplomatic, channels, between, the, two, had, begun, during, edward, s, time, on, crusade, regarding, a, possible, alliance, to, retake, the, holy, land, for, europe, edward, received, mongol, envoys, at, his, court, in, gascony, while, there, in, 1287, and, one, of, their, leaders, rabban, bar, sauma, recorded, an, extant, account, of, the, interaction, other, embassies, arrived, in, europe, in, 1289, and, 1290, the, former, relaying, ilkhan, abaqa, s, offer, to, join, forces, with, the, crusaders, and, supply, them, with, horses, edward, responded, favourably, declaring, his, intent, to, embark, on, a, journey, to, the, east, once, he, obtained, papal, approval, although, this, would, not, materialise, the, king, s, decision, to, send, geoffrey, of, langley, as, his, ambassador, to, the, mongols, revealed, that, he, was, seriously, considering, the, prospective, mongol, alliance, eleanor, of, castile, died, on, 28, november, 1290, the, couple, loved, each, other, and, like, his, father, edward, was, very, devoted, to, his, wife, and, was, faithful, to, her, throughout, their, marriage, he, was, deeply, affected, by, her, death, and, displayed, his, grief, by, erecting, twelve, so, called, eleanor, crosses, one, at, each, place, where, her, funeral, cort, ge, stopped, for, the, night, as, part, of, the, peace, accord, between, england, and, france, in, 1294, it, was, agreed, that, edward, should, marry, philip, iv, s, half, sister, margaret, but, the, marriage, was, delayed, by, the, outbreak, of, war, edward, made, expensive, alliances, with, the, german, king, the, counts, of, flanders, and, guelders, and, the, burgundians, who, would, attack, france, from, the, north, the, alliances, proved, volatile, and, edward, was, facing, trouble, at, home, at, the, time, both, in, wales, and, scotland, his, admiral, barrau, de, sescas, kept, remaining, english, forces, in, gascony, supplied, but, it, was, not, until, august, 1297, that, he, was, finally, able, to, sail, for, flanders, at, which, time, his, allies, there, had, already, suffered, defeat, the, support, from, germany, never, materialised, and, edward, was, forced, to, seek, peace, in, 1299, the, treaties, of, montreuil, and, chartres, along, with, edward, s, marriage, to, margaret, produced, a, prolonged, armistice, but, the, whole, affair, had, proven, both, costly, and, fruitless, for, the, english, french, occupation, of, most, of, gascony, would, not, end, until, the, 1303, treaty, of, paris, at, which, point, it, was, partially, returned, to, the, english, crown, again, as, a, french, fief, the, relationship, between, england, and, scotland, by, the, 1280s, was, one, of, relatively, harmonious, coexistence, the, issue, of, homage, did, not, reach, the, same, level, of, controversy, as, it, did, in, wales, in, 1278, king, alexander, iii, of, scotland, paid, homage, to, edward, who, was, his, brother, in, law, but, apparently, only, for, the, lands, he, held, in, england, problems, arose, only, with, the, scottish, succession, crisis, of, the, early, 1290s, when, alexander, died, in, 1286, he, left, as, heir, to, the, scottish, throne, margaret, his, three, year, old, granddaughter, and, sole, surviving, descendant, by, the, treaty, of, birgham, it, was, agreed, that, margaret, should, marry, king, edward, s, six, year, old, son, edward, of, caernarfon, though, scotland, would, remain, free, of, english, overlordship, margaret, by, now, seven, years, of, age, sailed, from, norway, for, scotland, in, the, autumn, of, 1290, but, fell, ill, on, the, way, and, died, in, orkney, this, left, the, country, without, an, obvious, heir, and, led, to, the, succession, dispute, known, to, history, as, the, great, cause, even, though, as, many, as, fourteen, claimants, put, forward, their, claims, to, the, title, the, foremost, competitors, were, john, balliol, and, robert, de, brus, 5th, lord, of, annandale, the, scottish, magnates, made, a, request, to, edward, to, conduct, the, proceedings, and, administer, the, outcome, but, not, to, arbitrate, in, the, dispute, the, actual, decision, would, be, made, by, 104, auditors, 40, appointed, by, balliol, 40, by, brus, and, the, remaining, 24, selected, by, edward, from, senior, members, of, the, scottish, political, community, at, birgham, with, the, prospect, of, a, personal, union, between, the, two, realms, the, question, of, suzerainty, had, not, been, of, great, importance, to, edward, now, he, insisted, that, if, he, were, to, settle, the, contest, he, had, to, be, fully, recognised, as, scotland, s, feudal, overlord, the, scots, were, reluctant, to, make, such, a, concession, and, replied, that, since, the, country, had, no, king, no, one, had, the, authority, to, make, this, decision, this, problem, was, circumvented, when, the, competitors, agreed, that, the, realm, would, be, handed, over, to, edward, until, a, rightful, heir, had, been, found, after, a, lengthy, hearing, a, decision, was, made, in, favour, of, john, balliol, on, 17, november, 1292, even, after, balliol, s, accession, edward, still, continued, to, assert, his, authority, over, scotland, against, the, objections, of, the, scots, he, agreed, to, hear, appeals, on, cases, ruled, on, by, the, court, of, guardians, that, had, governed, scotland, during, the, interregnum, a, further, provocation, came, in, a, case, brought, by, macduff, son, of, malcolm, ii, earl, of, fife, in, which, edward, demanded, that, balliol, appear, in, person, before, the, english, parliament, to, answer, the, charges, this, the, scottish, king, did, but, the, final, straw, was, edward, s, demand, that, the, scottish, magnates, provide, military, service, in, the, war, against, france, this, was, unacceptable, the, scots, instead, formed, an, alliance, with, france, and, launched, an, unsuccessful, attack, on, carlisle, edward, responded, by, invading, scotland, in, 1296, and, taking, the, town, of, berwick, upon, tweed, which, included, the, massacre, of, civilians, at, the, battle, of, dunbar, scottish, resistance, was, effectively, crushed, edward, confiscated, the, stone, of, destiny, the, scottish, coronation, stone, and, brought, it, to, westminster, placing, it, in, what, became, known, as, king, edward, s, chair, he, deposed, balliol, and, placed, him, in, the, tower, of, london, and, installed, englishmen, to, govern, the, country, the, campaign, had, been, very, successful, but, the, english, triumph, would, be, only, temporary, edward, had, a, reputation, for, a, fierce, and, sometimes, unpredictable, temper, and, he, could, be, intimidating, one, story, tells, of, how, the, dean, of, st, paul, s, wishing, to, confront, edward, over, the, high, level, of, taxation, in, 1295, fell, down, and, died, once, he, was, in, the, king, s, presence, and, one, 14th, century, chronicler, attributed, the, death, of, archbishop, thomas, of, york, to, the, king, s, harsh, conduct, towards, him, when, edward, of, caernarfon, demanded, an, earldom, for, his, favourite, piers, gaveston, the, king, erupted, in, anger, and, supposedly, tore, out, handfuls, of, his, son, s, hair, some, of, his, contemporaries, considered, edward, frightening, particularly, in, his, early, days, the, song, of, lewes, in, 1264, described, him, as, a, leopard, an, animal, regarded, as, particularly, powerful, and, unpredictable, at, times, edward, exhibited, a, gentler, disposition, and, was, known, to, be, devoted, to, his, large, family, he, was, close, to, his, daughters, and, frequently, lavished, expensive, gifts, on, them, whenever, they, visited, court, despite, his, harsh, disposition, edward, s, english, contemporaries, considered, him, an, able, even, an, ideal, king, though, not, loved, by, his, subjects, he, was, feared, and, respected, as, reflected, in, the, fact, that, there, were, no, armed, rebellions, in, england, during, his, reign, edward, is, often, noted, as, exhibiting, vindictiveness, towards, his, defeated, enemies, and, triumphalism, in, his, actions, historian, r, r, davies, considered, edward, s, repeated, and, gratuitous, belittling, of, his, opponents, to, have, been, one, of, the, most, consistent, and, unattractive, features, of, his, character, as, king, examples, include, the, seizure, of, fragments, of, the, holy, cross, from, wales, after, its, defeat, in, 1283, and, subsequently, the, stone, of, scoon, and, regalia, from, scotland, after, defeats, in, 1296, some, historians, question, edward, s, good, faith, and, trustworthiness, in, relation, to, his, dealing, with, wales, and, scotland, believing, him, to, have, been, capable, of, going, back, on, his, word, or, behaving, duplicitously, historian, michael, prestwich, believes, edward, met, contemporary, expectations, of, kingship, in, his, role, as, an, able, determined, soldier, and, in, his, embodiment, of, shared, chivalric, ideals, in, religious, observance, he, also, fulfilled, the, expectations, of, his, age, he, attended, chapel, regularly, gave, alms, generously, and, showed, a, fervent, devotion, to, the, virgin, mary, and, saint, thomas, becket, like, his, father, edward, was, a, keen, participant, in, the, tradition, of, the, royal, touch, which, had, the, supposed, effect, of, curing, those, who, were, touched, from, scrofula, contemporary, records, suggest, that, the, king, touched, upwards, of, a, thousand, people, each, year, despite, his, personal, piety, edward, was, frequently, in, conflict, with, the, archbishops, of, canterbury, who, served, during, his, reign, relations, with, the, papacy, were, at, times, no, better, edward, coming, into, conflict, with, rome, over, the, issue, of, ecclesiastical, taxation, edward, s, use, of, the, church, extended, to, war, mobilisation, including, disseminating, official, justifications, for, war, usually, through, the, issue, of, writs, to, england, s, archbishops, who, distributed, his, requests, for, services, and, prayers, edward, s, architectural, programme, similarly, had, an, element, of, propaganda, sometimes, combining, this, with, religious, messages, of, piety, as, with, the, eleanor, crosses, edward, took, a, keen, interest, in, the, stories, of, king, arthur, which, were, highly, popular, in, europe, during, his, reign, in, 1278, he, visited, glastonbury, abbey, to, open, what, was, then, believed, to, be, the, tomb, of, arthur, and, guinevere, recovering, arthur, s, crown, from, llywelyn, after, the, conquest, of, north, wales, his, castle, building, campaign, in, wales, drew, upon, the, arthurian, myths, in, their, design, and, location, he, held, round, table, events, in, 1284, and, 1302, involving, tournaments, and, feasting, and, chroniclers, compared, him, and, the, events, at, his, court, to, arthur, in, some, cases, edward, appears, to, have, used, his, interest, in, the, arthurian, myths, to, serve, his, own, political, interests, including, legitimising, his, rule, in, wales, and, discrediting, the, welsh, belief, that, arthur, might, return, as, their, political, saviour, soon, after, assuming, the, throne, edward, set, about, restoring, order, and, re, establishing, royal, authority, after, the, troubled, reign, of, his, father, to, accomplish, this, he, immediately, ordered, an, extensive, change, of, administrative, personnel, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, designation, of, robert, burnell, as, chancellor, in, 1274, a, man, who, would, remain, in, the, post, until, 1292, as, one, of, the, king, s, closest, associates, the, same, year, as, burnell, s, appointment, edward, replaced, most, local, officials, such, as, the, escheators, and, sheriffs, this, last, measure, was, taken, in, preparation, for, an, extensive, inquest, covering, all, of, england, that, would, hear, complaints, about, abuse, of, power, by, royal, officers, the, second, purpose, of, the, inquest, was, to, establish, what, land, and, rights, the, crown, had, lost, during, the, reign, of, henry, iii, the, inquest, produced, a, set, of, census, documents, called, the, hundred, rolls, these, have, been, likened, to, the, 11th, century, domesday, book, and, they, formed, the, basis, for, the, later, legal, inquiries, called, the, quo, warranto, proceedings, the, purpose, of, these, inquiries, was, to, establish, by, what, warrant, latin, quo, warranto, liberties, were, held, if, the, defendant, could, not, produce, a, royal, licence, to, prove, the, grant, of, the, liberty, then, it, was, the, crown, s, opinion, based, on, the, writings, of, the, influential, thirteenth, century, legal, scholar, henry, de, bracton, that, the, liberty, should, revert, to, the, king, both, the, statute, of, westminster, 1275, and, statute, of, westminster, 1285, codified, the, existing, law, in, england, by, enacting, the, statute, of, gloucester, in, 1278, the, king, challenged, baronial, rights, through, a, revival, of, the, system, of, general, eyres, royal, justices, to, go, on, tour, throughout, the, land, and, through, a, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, pleas, of, quo, warranto, to, be, heard, by, such, eyres, this, caused, great, consternation, among, the, aristocracy, who, insisted, that, long, use, in, itself, constituted, licence, a, compromise, was, eventually, reached, in, 1290, whereby, a, liberty, was, considered, legitimate, as, long, as, it, could, be, shown, to, have, been, exercised, since, the, coronation, of, richard, the, lionheart, in, 1189, royal, gains, from, the, quo, warranto, proceedings, were, insignificant, as, few, liberties, were, returned, to, the, king, but, he, had, nevertheless, won, a, significant, victory, by, establishing, the, principle, that, all, liberties, emanated, from, the, crown, the, 1290, statute, of, quo, warranto, was, only, one, part, of, a, wider, legislative, reform, which, was, one, of, the, most, important, contributions, of, edward, s, reign, this, era, of, legislative, action, had, started, already, at, the, time, of, the, baronial, reform, movement, the, statute, of, marlborough, 1267, contained, elements, both, of, the, provisions, of, oxford, and, the, dictum, of, kenilworth, the, compilation, of, the, hundred, rolls, was, followed, shortly, after, by, the, issue, of, westminster, i, 1275, which, asserted, the, royal, prerogative, and, outlined, restrictions, on, liberties, the, statutes, of, mortmain, 1279, addressed, the, issue, of, land, grants, to, the, church, the, first, clause, of, westminster, ii, 1285, known, as, de, donis, conditionalibus, dealt, with, family, settlement, of, land, and, entails, the, statute, of, merchants, 1285, established, firm, rules, for, the, recovery, of, debts, and, the, statute, of, winchester, 1285, dealt, with, security, and, peacekeeping, on, a, local, level, by, bolstering, the, existing, police, system, quia, emptores, 1290, issued, along, with, quo, warranto, set, out, to, remedy, land, ownership, disputes, resulting, from, alienation, of, land, by, subinfeudation, the, age, of, the, great, statutes, largely, ended, with, the, death, of, robert, burnell, in, 1292, edward, s, reign, saw, an, overhaul, of, the, coinage, system, which, was, in, a, poor, state, by, 1279, compared, to, the, coinage, already, circulating, at, the, time, of, edward, s, accession, the, new, coins, issued, proved, to, be, of, superior, quality, in, addition, to, minting, pennies, halfpences, and, farthings, a, new, denomination, called, the, groat, which, proved, to, be, unsuccessful, was, introduced, the, coinmaking, process, itself, was, also, improved, the, moneyer, william, turnemire, introduced, a, novel, method, of, minting, coins, that, involved, cutting, blank, coins, from, a, silver, rod, in, contrast, with, the, old, practice, of, stamping, them, out, from, sheets, this, technique, proved, to, be, efficient, the, practice, of, minting, coins, with, the, moneyer, s, name, on, them, became, obsolete, under, edward, s, rule, because, england, s, mint, administration, became, far, more, centralised, under, the, crown, s, authority, during, this, time, english, coins, were, frequently, counterfeited, on, the, continent, especially, the, low, countries, and, despite, a, ban, in, 1283, english, coinage, was, secretly, exported, to, the, european, continent, in, august, 1280, edward, forbade, the, usage, of, the, old, long, cross, coinage, which, forced, the, populace, to, switch, to, the, newly, minted, versions, records, indicate, that, the, coinage, overhaul, successfully, provided, england, with, a, stable, currency, edward, s, frequent, military, campaigns, put, a, great, financial, strain, on, the, nation, there, were, several, ways, through, which, the, king, could, raise, money, for, war, including, customs, duties, loans, and, lay, subsidies, which, were, taxes, collected, at, a, certain, fraction, of, the, moveable, property, of, all, laymen, who, held, such, assets, in, 1275, edward, negotiated, an, agreement, with, the, domestic, merchant, community, that, secured, a, permanent, duty, on, wool, england, s, primary, export, in, 1303, a, similar, agreement, was, reached, with, foreign, merchants, in, return, for, certain, rights, and, privileges, the, revenues, from, the, customs, duty, were, handled, by, the, riccardi, a, group, of, bankers, from, lucca, in, italy, this, was, in, return, for, their, service, as, moneylenders, to, the, crown, which, helped, finance, the, welsh, wars, when, the, war, with, france, broke, out, the, french, king, confiscated, the, riccardi, s, assets, and, the, bank, went, bankrupt, after, this, the, frescobaldi, of, florence, took, over, the, role, as, money, lenders, to, the, english, crown, edward, also, sought, to, reduce, pressure, on, his, finances, by, helping, his, wife, eleanor, to, build, an, independent, income, edward, held, parliament, on, a, regular, basis, throughout, his, reign, in, 1295, a, significant, change, occurred, for, this, parliament, as, well, as, the, secular, and, ecclesiastical, lords, two, knights, from, each, county, and, two, representatives, from, each, borough, were, summoned, the, representation, of, commons, in, parliament, was, nothing, new, what, was, new, was, the, authority, under, which, these, representatives, were, summoned, whereas, previously, the, commons, had, been, expected, simply, to, assent, to, decisions, already, made, by, the, magnates, it, was, now, proclaimed, that, they, should, meet, with, the, full, authority, plena, potestas, of, their, communities, to, give, assent, to, decisions, made, in, parliament, the, king, now, had, full, backing, for, collecting, lay, subsidies, from, the, entire, population, whereas, henry, iii, had, only, collected, four, of, these, in, his, reign, edward, collected, nine, this, format, eventually, became, the, standard, for, later, parliaments, and, historians, have, named, the, assembly, the, model, parliament, a, term, first, introduced, by, the, english, historian, william, stubbs, another, source, of, political, conflict, was, edward, s, policy, towards, the, english, jews, which, dominated, his, financial, relations, with, parliament, until, 1290, jews, unlike, christians, were, allowed, to, charge, interest, on, loans, known, as, usury, edward, faced, pressure, from, the, church, who, were, increasingly, intolerant, of, judaism, and, usury, the, jews, were, the, king, s, personal, property, and, he, was, free, to, tax, them, at, will, over, taxation, of, the, jews, forced, them, to, sell, their, debt, bonds, at, cut, prices, which, was, exploited, by, the, crown, to, transfer, vast, land, wealth, from, indebted, landholders, to, courtiers, and, particularly, his, wife, eleanor, of, provence, causing, widespread, resentment, in, 1275, facing, the, resulting, discontent, in, parliament, edward, issued, the, statute, of, the, jewry, which, outlawed, loans, with, interest, and, encouraged, the, jews, to, take, up, other, professions, in, 1279, in, the, context, of, a, supposed, crack, down, on, coin, clippers, he, organised, the, arrest, of, all, the, heads, of, jewish, households, in, england, approximately, a, tenth, of, the, jewish, population, around, 300, people, were, executed, others, were, allowed, to, pay, fines, at, least, 16, 000, was, raised, through, fines, and, the, seizure, of, property, from, the, dead, in, 1280, he, ordered, all, jews, to, attend, special, sermons, preached, by, dominican, friars, with, the, hope, of, persuading, them, to, convert, but, unsurprisingly, these, exhortations, were, not, followed, by, 1280, the, jews, had, been, exploited, to, a, level, at, which, they, were, no, longer, of, much, financial, use, to, the, crown, but, they, could, still, be, used, in, political, bargaining, the, final, attack, on, the, jews, in, england, came, in, the, edict, of, expulsion, in, 1290, whereby, edward, formally, expelled, all, jews, from, england, as, they, crossed, the, channel, to, france, some, became, victims, to, piracy, but, many, more, were, disposessed, or, died, in, the, storms, of, october, the, crown, disposed, of, their, property, through, sales, and, 85, grants, made, to, courtiers, and, family, the, edict, appears, to, have, been, issued, as, part, of, a, deal, to, secure, a, lay, subsidy, of, 110, 000, from, parliament, the, largest, granted, in, the, medieval, period, although, expulsions, had, taken, place, on, a, local, temporary, basis, the, english, expulsion, was, regarded, as, unprecedented, because, it, was, permanent, it, was, eventually, reversed, in, the, 1650s, edward, claimed, the, expulsion, was, done, in, honour, of, the, crucified, and, blamed, the, jews, for, their, treachery, and, criminality, he, helped, pay, for, the, renovation, of, the, tomb, of, little, saint, hugh, a, child, falsely, claimed, to, have, been, ritually, crucified, by, jews, in, the, same, style, as, the, eleanor, crosses, to, take, political, credit, for, his, actions, as, historian, richard, stacey, notes, a, more, explicit, identification, of, the, crown, with, the, ritual, crucifixion, charge, can, hardly, be, imagined, edward, s, primary, interest, in, ireland, was, as, a, source, of, resources, soldiers, and, funds, for, his, wars, in, gascony, wales, scotland, and, flanders, royal, interventions, aimed, at, maximising, economic, extraction, corruption, among, edward, s, officials, was, at, a, concerningly, high, level, and, despite, edward, s, efforts, after, 1272, to, reform, the, irish, administration, record, keeping, was, poor, disturbances, in, ireland, increased, during, the, period, the, weakness, and, lack, of, direction, given, to, the, lordship, s, rule, allowed, factional, fighting, to, grow, reinforced, by, the, introduction, of, indentured, military, service, by, irish, magnates, from, around, 1290, the, funnelling, of, revenue, to, edward, s, wars, left, irish, castles, bridges, and, roads, in, a, state, of, disrepair, and, alongside, the, withdrawal, of, troops, to, be, used, against, wales, and, scotland, and, elsewhere, helped, induce, lawless, behaviour, resistance, to, purveyances, or, forced, purchase, of, supplies, such, as, grain, added, to, lawlessness, and, caused, speculation, and, inflation, in, the, price, of, basic, goods, pardons, were, granted, to, lawbreakers, for, service, for, the, king, in, england, revenues, and, removal, of, troops, for, edward, s, wars, left, the, country, unable, to, address, its, basic, needs, while, the, administration, was, wholly, focused, on, providing, for, edward, s, war, demands, troops, looted, and, fought, with, townspeople, when, on, the, move, gaelic, ireland, enjoyed, a, revival, due, to, the, absence, of, english, magnates, and, the, weakness, of, the, lordship, assimilating, some, of, the, settlers, edward, s, government, was, hostile, to, the, use, of, gaelic, law, which, it, condemned, in, 1277, as, displeasing, to, god, and, to, reason, conflict, was, firmly, entrenched, by, the, time, of, the, 1297, irish, parliament, which, attempted, to, create, measures, to, counter, disorder, and, the, spread, of, gaelic, customs, and, law, while, the, results, of, the, distress, included, many, abandoned, lands, and, villages, the, incessant, warfare, of, the, 1290s, put, a, great, financial, demand, on, edward, s, subjects, whereas, the, king, had, levied, only, three, lay, subsidies, until, 1294, four, such, taxes, were, granted, in, the, years, 1294, 1297, raising, over, 200, 000, along, with, this, came, the, burden, of, prises, seizure, of, wool, and, hides, and, the, unpopular, additional, duty, on, wool, dubbed, the, maltolt, unjustly, taken, the, fiscal, demands, on, the, king, s, subjects, caused, resentment, which, eventually, led, to, serious, political, opposition, the, initial, resistance, was, caused, not, by, the, lay, taxes, but, by, clerical, subsidies, in, 1294, edward, made, a, demand, of, a, grant, of, one, half, of, all, clerical, revenues, there, was, some, resistance, but, the, king, responded, by, threatening, opponents, with, outlawry, and, the, grant, was, eventually, made, at, the, time, robert, winchelsey, the, designated, archbishop, of, canterbury, was, in, italy, to, receive, consecration, winchelsey, returned, in, january, 1295, and, had, to, consent, to, another, grant, in, november, of, that, year, in, 1296, his, position, changed, when, he, received, the, papal, bull, clericis, laicos, this, bull, prohibited, the, clergy, from, paying, taxes, to, lay, authorities, without, explicit, consent, from, the, pope, when, the, clergy, with, reference, to, the, bull, refused, to, pay, edward, responded, with, outlawry, winchelsey, was, presented, with, a, dilemma, between, loyalty, to, the, king, and, upholding, the, papal, bull, and, he, responded, by, leaving, it, to, every, individual, clergyman, to, pay, as, he, saw, fit, by, the, end, of, the, year, a, solution, was, offered, by, the, new, papal, bull, etsi, de, statu, which, allowed, clerical, taxation, in, cases, of, pressing, urgency, this, allowed, edward, to, collect, considerable, sums, by, taxing, the, english, clergy, edward, by, god, sir, earl, either, go, or, hang, roger, bigod, by, that, same, oath, o, king, i, shall, neither, go, nor, hang, chronicle, of, walter, of, guisborough, opposition, from, the, laity, took, longer, to, surface, this, resistance, focused, on, two, things, the, king, s, right, to, demand, military, service, and, his, right, to, levy, taxes, at, the, salisbury, parliament, of, february, 1297, the, earl, marshal, roger, bigod, 5th, earl, of, norfolk, objected, to, a, royal, summons, of, military, service, bigod, argued, that, the, military, obligation, only, extended, to, service, alongside, the, king, if, the, king, intended, to, sail, to, flanders, he, could, not, send, his, subjects, to, gascony, in, july, bigod, and, humphrey, de, bohun, 3rd, earl, of, hereford, and, constable, of, england, drew, up, a, series, of, complaints, known, as, the, remonstrances, in, which, objections, to, the, extortionate, level, of, taxation, were, voiced, undeterred, edward, requested, another, lay, subsidy, this, one, was, particularly, provocative, because, the, king, had, sought, consent, from, only, a, small, group, of, magnates, rather, than, from, representatives, of, the, communities, in, parliament, while, edward, was, in, winchelsea, preparing, for, the, campaign, in, flanders, bigod, and, de, bohun, arrived, at, the, exchequer, to, prevent, the, collection, of, the, tax, as, the, king, left, the, country, with, a, greatly, reduced, force, the, kingdom, seemed, to, be, on, the, verge, of, civil, war, the, english, defeat, by, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, stirling, bridge, resolved, the, situation, the, renewed, threat, to, the, homeland, gave, king, and, magnates, common, cause, edward, signed, the, confirmatio, cartarum, a, confirmation, of, magna, carta, and, its, accompanying, charter, of, the, forest, and, the, nobility, agreed, to, serve, with, the, king, on, a, campaign, in, scotland, edward, s, problems, with, the, opposition, did, not, end, with, the, scottish, campaign, over, the, following, years, he, would, be, held, to, the, promises, he, had, made, in, particular, that, of, upholding, the, charter, of, the, forest, in, the, parliament, of, 1301, the, king, was, forced, to, order, an, assessment, of, the, royal, forests, but, in, 1305, he, obtained, a, papal, bull, that, freed, him, from, this, concession, ultimately, it, was, a, change, in, personnel, that, spelt, the, end, of, the, opposition, against, edward, de, bohun, died, late, in, 1298, after, returning, from, the, scottish, campaign, in, 1302, bigod, arrived, at, an, agreement, with, the, king, that, was, beneficial, for, both, bigod, who, had, no, children, made, edward, his, heir, in, return, for, a, generous, annual, grant, edward, finally, got, his, revenge, on, winchelsey, who, had, been, opposed, to, the, king, s, policy, of, clerical, taxation, in, 1305, when, clement, v, was, elected, pope, clement, was, a, gascon, sympathetic, to, the, king, and, on, edward, s, instigation, had, winchelsey, suspended, from, office, edward, believed, that, he, had, completed, the, conquest, of, scotland, when, he, left, the, country, in, 1296, but, resistance, soon, emerged, under, the, leadership, of, andrew, de, moray, in, the, north, and, william, wallace, in, the, south, on, 11, september, 1297, a, large, english, force, under, the, leadership, of, john, de, warenne, 6th, earl, of, surrey, and, hugh, de, cressingham, was, routed, by, a, much, smaller, scottish, army, led, by, wallace, and, moray, at, the, battle, of, stirling, bridge, the, defeat, sent, shockwaves, into, england, and, preparations, for, a, retaliatory, campaign, started, immediately, soon, after, edward, returned, from, flanders, he, headed, north, on, 22, july, 1298, in, the, only, major, battle, he, had, fought, since, evesham, in, 1265, edward, defeated, wallace, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, edward, underestimated, the, gravity, of, the, ever, changing, military, condition, in, the, north, and, was, not, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, momentum, the, next, year, the, scots, managed, to, recapture, stirling, castle, even, though, edward, campaigned, in, scotland, both, in, 1300, when, he, successfully, besieged, caerlaverock, castle, and, in, 1301, the, scots, refused, to, engage, in, open, battle, again, preferring, instead, to, raid, the, english, countryside, in, smaller, groups, the, scots, appealed, to, pope, boniface, viii, to, assert, a, papal, claim, of, overlordship, to, scotland, in, place, of, the, english, his, papal, bull, addressed, to, king, edward, in, these, terms, was, firmly, rejected, on, edward, s, behalf, by, the, barons, letter, of, 1301, the, english, managed, to, subdue, the, country, by, other, means, in, 1303, a, peace, agreement, was, reached, between, england, and, france, effectively, breaking, up, the, franco, scottish, alliance, robert, the, bruce, the, grandson, of, the, claimant, to, the, crown, in, 1291, had, sided, with, the, english, in, the, winter, of, 1301, 02, in, 1304, most, of, the, other, nobles, of, the, country, had, also, pledged, their, allegiance, to, edward, and, the, english, also, managed, to, re, take, stirling, castle, a, great, propaganda, victory, was, achieved, in, 1305, when, wallace, was, betrayed, by, sir, john, de, menteith, and, turned, over, to, the, english, who, had, him, taken, to, london, where, he, was, publicly, executed, with, scotland, largely, under, english, control, edward, installed, englishmen, and, collaborating, scots, to, govern, the, country, the, situation, changed, again, on, 10, february, 1306, when, robert, the, bruce, murdered, his, rival, john, comyn, and, a, few, weeks, later, on, 25, march, was, crowned, king, of, scotland, bruce, now, embarked, on, a, campaign, to, restore, scottish, independence, and, this, campaign, took, the, english, by, surprise, edward, was, suffering, ill, health, by, this, time, and, instead, of, leading, an, expedition, himself, he, gave, different, military, commands, to, aymer, de, valence, 2nd, earl, of, pembroke, and, henry, percy, 1st, baron, percy, while, the, main, royal, army, was, led, by, the, prince, of, wales, the, english, initially, met, with, success, on, 19, june, aymer, de, valence, routed, bruce, at, the, battle, of, methven, bruce, was, forced, into, hiding, and, the, english, forces, recaptured, their, lost, territory, and, castles, edward, acted, with, unusual, brutality, against, bruce, s, family, allies, and, supporters, his, sister, mary, was, imprisoned, in, a, cage, at, roxburgh, castle, for, four, years, isabella, macduff, countess, of, buchan, who, had, crowned, bruce, was, held, in, a, cage, at, berwick, castle, his, younger, brother, neil, was, executed, by, being, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, he, had, been, captured, after, he, and, his, garrison, held, off, edward, s, forces, who, had, been, seeking, his, wife, daughter, and, sisters, edward, now, regarded, the, struggle, not, as, a, war, between, two, nations, but, as, the, suppression, of, a, rebellion, of, disloyal, subjects, this, brutality, though, rather, than, helping, to, subdue, the, scots, had, the, opposite, effect, and, rallied, growing, support, for, bruce, in, february, 1307, bruce, resumed, his, efforts, and, started, gathering, men, and, in, may, he, defeated, valence, at, the, battle, of, loudoun, hill, edward, who, had, rallied, somewhat, now, moved, north, himself, he, developed, dysentery, on, the, way, and, his, condition, deteriorated, on, 6, july, he, encamped, at, burgh, by, sands, just, south, of, the, scottish, border, when, his, servants, came, the, next, morning, to, lift, him, up, so, that, he, could, eat, the, king, died, in, their, arms, several, stories, emerged, about, edward, s, deathbed, wishes, according, to, one, tradition, he, requested, that, his, heart, be, carried, to, the, holy, land, along, with, an, army, to, fight, the, infidels, a, more, dubious, story, tells, of, how, he, wished, for, his, bones, to, be, carried, along, on, future, expeditions, against, the, scots, another, account, of, his, deathbed, scene, is, more, credible, according, to, one, chronicle, edward, gathered, around, him, henry, de, lacy, 3rd, earl, of, lincoln, guy, de, beauchamp, 10th, earl, of, warwick, aymer, de, valence, and, robert, de, clifford, 1st, baron, de, clifford, and, charged, them, with, looking, after, his, son, edward, in, particular, they, should, make, sure, that, piers, gaveston, whom, he, had, banished, earlier, that, year, was, not, allowed, to, return, to, the, country, the, new, king, edward, ii, ignored, his, father, s, wish, and, had, his, favourite, recalled, from, exile, almost, immediately, edward, ii, remained, in, the, north, until, august, but, then, abandoned, the, campaign, and, headed, south, partially, due, to, financial, limitations, he, was, crowned, king, on, 25, february, 1308, edward, i, s, body, was, brought, south, lying, in, state, at, waltham, abbey, before, being, buried, in, westminster, abbey, on, 27, october, there, are, few, records, of, the, funeral, which, cost, 473, edward, s, tomb, was, an, unusually, plain, sarcophagus, of, purbeck, marble, without, the, customary, royal, effigy, possibly, the, result, of, the, shortage, of, royal, funds, the, society, of, antiquaries, of, london, opened, the, tomb, in, 1774, finding, that, the, body, had, been, well, preserved, over, the, preceding, 467, years, and, took, the, opportunity, to, determine, the, king, s, original, height, traces, of, the, latin, inscription, edwardus, primus, scottorum, malleus, hic, est, 1308, pactum, serva, here, is, edward, i, hammer, of, the, scots, 1308, keep, the, troth, can, still, be, seen, painted, on, the, side, of, the, tomb, referring, to, his, vow, to, avenge, the, rebellion, of, robert, the, bruce, this, resulted, in, edward, being, given, the, epithet, the, hammer, of, the, scots, by, historians, but, is, not, contemporary, in, origin, having, been, added, by, the, abbot, john, feckenham, in, the, 16th, century, the, first, histories, of, edward, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, drew, primarily, on, the, works, of, the, chroniclers, and, made, little, use, of, the, official, records, of, the, period, they, limited, themselves, to, general, comments, on, edward, s, significance, as, a, monarch, and, echoed, the, chroniclers, praise, for, his, accomplishments, during, the, 17th, century, the, lawyer, edward, coke, wrote, extensively, about, edward, s, legislation, terming, the, king, the, english, justinian, after, the, renowned, byzantine, lawmaker, justinian, i, later, in, the, century, historians, used, the, available, record, as, evidence, to, elucidate, the, roles, of, parliament, and, kingship, under, edward, drawing, comparisons, between, his, reign, and, the, political, strife, of, their, own, century, eighteenth, century, historians, established, a, picture, of, edward, as, an, able, if, ruthless, monarch, conditioned, by, the, circumstances, of, his, own, time, the, influential, victorian, historian, william, stubbs, instead, suggested, that, edward, had, actively, shaped, national, history, forming, english, laws, and, institutions, and, helping, england, to, develop, a, parliamentary, and, constitutional, monarchy, his, strengths, and, weaknesses, as, a, ruler, were, considered, to, be, emblematic, of, the, english, people, as, a, whole, stubbs, s, student, thomas, tout, initially, adopted, the, same, perspective, but, after, extensive, research, into, edward, s, royal, household, and, backed, by, the, research, of, his, contemporaries, into, the, early, parliaments, of, the, period, he, changed, his, mind, tout, came, to, view, edward, as, a, self, interested, conservative, leader, using, the, parliamentary, system, as, the, shrewd, device, of, an, autocrat, anxious, to, use, the, mass, of, the, people, as, a, check, upon, his, hereditary, foes, among, the, greater, baronage, historians, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, conducted, extensive, research, on, edward, and, his, reign, most, have, concluded, this, was, a, highly, significant, period, in, english, medieval, history, some, going, further, and, describing, edward, as, one, of, the, great, medieval, kings, although, most, also, agree, that, his, final, years, were, less, successful, than, his, early, decades, in, power, g, templeman, argued, in, his, 1950, historiographical, essay, that, it, is, generally, recognized, that, edward, i, deserves, a, high, place, in, the, history, of, medieval, england, three, major, academic, narratives, of, edward, have, been, produced, during, this, period, f, m, powicke, s, volumes, published, in, 1947, and, 1953, forming, the, standard, works, on, edward, for, several, decades, were, largely, positive, in, praising, the, achievements, of, his, reign, and, in, particular, his, focus, on, justice, and, the, law, in, 1988, michael, prestwich, produced, an, authoritative, biography, of, the, king, focusing, on, his, political, career, still, portraying, him, in, sympathetic, terms, but, highlighting, some, of, the, consequences, of, his, failed, policies, marc, morris, s, biography, followed, in, 2008, drawing, out, more, of, the, detail, of, edward, s, personality, and, generally, taking, a, harsher, view, of, his, weaknesses, and, less, pleasant, characteristics, pointing, out, that, modern, analysts, of, edward, s, reign, denounce, the, king, for, his, policies, against, the, jewish, community, in, england, considerable, academic, debate, has, taken, place, around, the, character, of, edward, s, kingship, his, political, skills, and, in, particular, his, management, of, his, earls, and, the, degree, to, which, this, was, collaborative, or, repressive, in, nature, historians, have, debated, how, edward, i, s, reign, should, be, assessed, michael, prestwich, in, 1988, attempted, to, judge, him, by, the, standards, of, his, time, fred, cazel, agrees, with, this, approach, particularly, regarding, his, lack, of, political, sensitivity, and, uncompromising, attitudes, arguing, that, anger, was, his, political, weapon, prestwich, concludes, that, edward, was, a, formidable, king, his, reign, with, both, its, successes, and, its, disappointments, a, great, one, and, he, was, without, doubt, one, of, the, greatest, rulers, of, his, time, however, g, w, s, barrow, counters, that, edward, s, contemporaries, knew, the, meaning, of, compassion, magnanimity, justice, and, generosity, that, he, rarely, rose, above, minimum, moral, standards, of, his, time, but, rather, showed, a, highly, vindictive, streak, and, is, among, the, boldest, opportunists, of, english, political, history, john, gillingham, argues, that, edward, was, an, effective, bully, but, no, king, of, england, had, a, greater, impact, on, the, peoples, of, britain, than, edward, i, and, that, modern, historians, of, the, english, state, have, always, recognized, edward, i, s, reign, as, pivotal, most, recently, andrew, spencer, and, caroline, burt, have, reassessed, edward, s, reign, from, an, english, constitutional, perspective, asserting, that, he, had, a, personal, role, in, reform, and, a, moral, purpose, in, his, leadership, spencer, concludes, that, edward, s, reign, was, indeed, a, great, one, and, burt, claims, that, edward, was, innovative, creative, focused, and, successful, she, adds, that, he, played, the, part, of, a, good, king, well, with, aplomb, colin, veach, asks, whether, the, welsh, scots, irish, and, jews, would, have, agreed, there, is, a, great, difference, between, english, and, scottish, historiography, on, king, edward, g, w, s, barrow, saw, edward, as, ruthlessly, exploiting, the, leaderless, state, of, scotland, to, obtain, feudal, superiority, over, the, kingdom, and, reduce, it, to, an, english, possession, in, his, view, edward, s, insistence, on, war, and, misapprehension, of, scottish, capacity, for, resistance, created, a, bitter, antagonism, which, endured, for, centuries, michael, brown, warns, that, scottish, independence, should, not, be, viewed, as, inevitable, edward, could, have, achieved, his, goals, welsh, historians, see, edward,
