at, a, point, just, north, of, the, 38th, parallel, after, a, series, of, offensives, and, counter, offensives, by, both, sides, followed, by, a, grueling, period, of, largely, static, trench, warfare, that, lasted, from, the, summer, of, 1951, to, july, 1953, the, front, was, stabilized, along, what, eventually, became, the, permanent, armistice, line, of, 27, july, 1953, over, 2, 5, million, people, died, during, the, korean, war, chinese, and, russian, documents, from, that, time, reveal, that, kim, became, increasingly, desperate, to, establish, a, truce, since, the, likelihood, that, further, fighting, would, successfully, unify, korea, under, his, rule, became, more, remote, with, the, un, and, us, presence, kim, also, resented, the, chinese, taking, over, the, majority, of, the, fighting, in, his, country, with, chinese, forces, stationed, at, the, center, of, the, front, line, and, the, korean, people, s, army, being, mostly, restricted, to, the, coastal, flanks, of, the, front, with, the, end, of, the, korean, war, despite, the, failure, to, unify, korea, under, his, rule, kim, il, sung, proclaimed, the, war, a, victory, in, the, sense, that, he, had, remained, in, power, in, the, north, however, the, three, year, war, left, north, korea, devastated, and, kim, immediately, embarked, on, a, large, reconstruction, effort, he, launched, a, five, year,

which, was, fraught, with, political, instability, and, economic, crises, in, the, ensuing, years, kim, established, himself, as, an, independent, leader, of, international, communism, in, 1956, he, joined, mao, in, the, anti, revisionist, camp, which, did, not, accept, nikita, khrushchev, s, program, of, de, stalinization, yet, he, did, not, become, a, maoist, himself, at, the, same, time, he,

choe, chang, ik, appears, to, have, been, purged, as, well, yi, sang, cho, north, korea, s, ambassador, to, the, soviet, union, and, a, critic, of, kim, who, defected, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1956, was, declared, a, factionalist, and, a, traitor, the, 1955, juche, speech, which, stressed, korean, independence, debuted, in, the, context, of, kim, s, power, struggle, against, leaders, such,

opposition, to, the, idea, of, north, korea, as, a, satellite, state, of, china, or, the, soviet, union, kim, transformed, north, korea, into, what, wonjun, song, and, joseph, wright, consider, a, personalist, dictatorship, where, power, was, centralized, in, kim, personally, kim, il, sung, s, cult, of, personality, had, initially, been, criticized, by, some, members, of, the, government, the, north, korean, ambassador, to, the, ussr, li, sangjo, a, member, of, the, yan, an, faction, reported, that, it, had, become, a, criminal, offense, to, so, much, as, write, on, kim, s, picture, in, a, newspaper, and, that, he, had, been, elevated, to, the, status, of, marx, lenin, mao, and, stalin, in, the, communist, pantheon, he, also, charged, kim, with, rewriting, history, so, it, would, appear, as, if, his, guerrilla, faction, had, single, handedly, liberated, korea, from, the, japanese, completely, ignoring, the, assistance, of, the, chinese, people, s, volunteers, in, addition, li, stated, that, in, the, process, of, agricultural, collectivization, grain, was, being, forcibly, confiscated, from, the, peasants, leading, to, at, least, 300, suicides, and, he, also, stated, that, kim, made, nearly, all, major, policy, decisions, and, appointments, himself, li, reported, that, over, 30, 000, people, were, in, prison, for, completely, unjust, and, arbitrary, reasons, which, were, as, trivial, as, not, printing, kim, il, sung, s, portrait, on, sufficient, quality, paper, or, using, newspapers, with, his, picture, to, wrap, parcels, grain, confiscation, and, tax, collection, were, also, conducted, with, force, which, consisted, of, violence, beatings, and, threats, of, imprisonment, during, the, 1956, august, faction, incident, kim, il, sung, successfully, resisted, soviet, and, chinese, efforts, to, depose, him, in, favor, of, pro, soviet, koreans, or, koreans, who, belonged, to, the, pro, chinese, yan, an, faction, the, last, chinese, troops, withdrew, from, the, country, in, october, 1958, which, is, the, consensus, as, the, latest, date, when, north, korea, became, effectively, independent, though, some, scholars, believe, that, the, 1956, august, incident, demonstrated, north, korea, s, independence, during, his, rise, and, his, consolidation, of, power, kim, created, the, songbun, a, caste, system, in, which, the, north, korean, people, were, divided, into, three, groups, each, person, was, classified, as, belonging, to, the, core, wavering, or, hostile, class, based, on, his, or, her, political, social, and, economic, background, this, caste, system, persists, today, songbun, was, used, to, decide, all, aspects, of, a, person, s, existence, in, north, korean, society, including, access, to, education, housing, employment, food, rationing, ability, to, join, the, ruling, party, and, even, where, a, person, was, allowed, to, live, large, numbers, of, people, from, the, so, called, hostile, class, which, included, intellectuals, land, owners, and, former, supporters, of, japan, s, occupying, government, during, world, war, ii, were, forcibly, relocated, to, the, country, s, isolated, and, impoverished, northern, provinces, when, years, of, famine, ravaged, the, country, in, the, 1990s, those, people, who, lived, in, its, marginalized, and, remote, communities, were, hardest, hit, during, his, rule, north, korea, s, government, was, responsible, for, widespread, human, rights, abuses, kim, il, sung, punished, real, and, perceived, dissent, through, purges, which, included, public, executions, and, enforced, disappearances, not, only, dissenters, but, their, entire, extended, families, were, punished, by, being, reduced, to, the, lowest, songbun, rank, and, many, of, them, were, also, incarcerated, in, a, secret, system, of, political, prison, camps, these, camps, or, kwanliso, a, part, of, kim, s, vast, network, of, abusive, penal, and, forced, labor, institutions, were, fenced, and, heavily, guarded, colonies, which, were, located, in, mountainous, areas, of, the, country, where, prisoners, were, forced, to, perform, back, breaking, labor, such, as, logging, mining, and, picking, crops, most, of, the, prisoners, were, incarcerated, in, these, camps, for, their, entire, lives, and, inside, the, camps, their, living, and, working, conditions, were, usually, deadly, for, example, prisoners, were, nearly, starved, to, death, they, were, denied, medical, care, they, were, denied, proper, housing, and, clothes, they, were, subjected, to, sexual, violence, they, were, regularly, mistreated, and, they, were, tortured, and, executed, by, guards, despite, his, opposition, to, de, stalinization, kim, never, officially, severed, relations, with, the, soviet, union, and, he, did, not, take, part, in, the, sino, soviet, split, after, khrushchev, was, replaced, by, leonid, brezhnev, in, 1964, kim, s, relations, with, the, soviet, union, became, closer, at, the, same, time, kim, was, increasingly, alienated, by, mao, s, unstable, style, of, leadership, especially, during, the, cultural, revolution, in, the, late, 1960s, kim, in, turn, was, denounced, by, mao, s, red, guards, at, the, same, time, kim, reinstated, relations, with, most, of, eastern, europe, s, communist, countries, primarily, with, erich, honecker, s, east, germany, and, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, romania, ceau, escu, was, heavily, influenced, by, kim, s, ideology, and, the, personality, cult, which, grew, around, him, in, romania, was, very, similar, to, that, of, kim, in, the, 1960s, kim, became, impressed, with, the, efforts, of, north, vietnamese, leader, ho, chi, minh, to, reunify, vietnam, through, guerrilla, warfare, and, thought, that, something, similar, might, be, possible, in, korea, 30, 31, infiltration, and, subversion, efforts, were, thus, greatly, stepped, up, against, us, forces, and, the, leadership, in, south, korea, 32, 33, these, efforts, culminated, in, an, attempt, to, storm, the, blue, house, and, assassinate, president, park, chung, hee, 32, north, korean, troops, thus, took, a, much, more, aggressive, stance, toward, us, forces, in, and, around, south, korea, engaging, us, army, troops, in, fire, fights, along, the, demilitarized, zone, the, 1968, capture, of, the, crew, of, the, spy, ship, uss, pueblo, was, a, part,

marxist, leninists, will, understand, that, the, ideology, which, is, guiding, the, korean, workers, party, and, the, communist, party, of, china, is, revisionist, and, later, that, month, he, added, that, in, pyongyang, i, believe, that, even, tito, will, be, astonished, at, the, proportions, of, the, cult, of, his, host, which, has, reached, a, level, unheard, of, anywhere, else, either, in, past, or, present, times, let, alone, in, a, country, which, calls, itself, socialist, he, further, claimed, that, the, leadership, of, the, communist, party, of, china, has, betrayed, in, korea, too, we, can, say, that, the, leadership, of, the, korean, workers, party, is, wallowing, in, the, same, waters, and, claimed, that, kim, il, sung, was, begging, for, aid, from, other, countries, especially, among, the, eastern, bloc, and, non, aligned, countries, like, yugoslavia, as, a, result, relations, between, north, korea, and, albania, would, remain, cold, and, tense, right, up, until, hoxha, s, death, in, 1985, although, a, resolute, anti, communist, zaire, s, mobutu, sese, seko, was, also, heavily, influenced, by, kim, s, style, of, rule, the, north, korean, government, s, practice, of, abducting, foreign, nationals, such, as, south, koreans, japanese, chinese, thais, and, romanians, is, another, practice, of, kim, il, sung, which, persists, to, the, present, day, kim, il, sung, planned, these, operations, to, seize, persons, who, could, be, used, to, support, north, korea, s, overseas, intelligence, operations, or, those, who, had, technical, skills, to, maintain, the, socialist, state, s, economic, infrastructure, in, farms, construction, hospitals, and, heavy, industry, according, to, the, korean, war, abductees, family, union, kwafu, those, abducted, by,

airlines, flight, ys, 11, in, 1969, by, north, korean, agents, the, pilots, and, mechanics, and, others, with, specialized, skills, were, the, only, ones, never, permitted, to, return, to, south, korea, the, total, number, of, foreign, abductees, and, disappeared, is, still, unknown, but, is, estimated, to, include, more, than, 200, 000, people, the, vast, majority, of, disappearances, occurred, or, were, linked, to, the, korean, war, but, hundreds, of, south, koreans, and, japanese, people, were, abducted, between, the, 1960s, and, 1980s, a, number, of, south, koreans, and, nationals, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, have, also, been, apparently, abducted, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, at, least, 100, 000, people, remain, disappeared, the, constitution, of, north, korea, was, proclaimed, on, december, 27, 1972, which, created, the, position, of, the, president, of, north, korea, kim, gave, up, his, former, premier, of, the, cabinet, position, which, he, had, held, since, 1948, and, became, instead, president, after, the, 1972, north, korean, parliamentary, election, on, 14, april, 1975, north, korea, discontinued, most, formal, use, of, its, traditional, units, and, adopted, the, metric, system, in, 1980, he, decided, that, his, son, kim, jong, il, would, succeed, him, and, increasingly, delegated, the, running, of, the, government, to, him, the, kim, family, was, supported, by, the, army, due, to, kim, il, sung, s, revolutionary, record, and, the, support, of, the, veteran, defense, minister, o, chin, u, at, the, sixth, party, congress, in, october, 1980, kim, publicly, designated, his, son, as, his, successor, in, 1986, a, rumor, spread, that, kim, had, been, assassinated, making, the, concern, for, jong, il, s, ability, to, succeed, his, father, actual, kim, dispelled, the, rumors, however, by, making, a, series, of, public, appearances, it, has, been, argued, however, that, the, incident, helped, establish, the, order, of, succession, the, first, apparent, patrilineal, in, a, communist, state, which, eventually, would, occur, upon, kim, il, sung, s, death, in, 1994, from, about, this, time, north, korea, encountered, increasing, economic, difficulties, south, korea, became, an, economic, powerhouse, fueled, by, japanese, and, american, investment, military, aid, and, internal, economic, development, while, north, korea, stagnated, and, then, declined, in, the, 1980s, the, practical, effect, of, juche, was, to, cut, the, country, off, from, virtually, all, foreign, trade, in, order, to, make, it, entirely, self, reliant, the, economic, reforms, of, deng, xiaoping, in, china, from, 1979, onward, meant, that, trade, with, the, moribund, economy, of, north, korea, held, decreasing, interest, for, china, the, revolutions, of, 1989, in, eastern, europe, and, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, from, 1989, to, 1992, completed, north, korea, s, virtual, isolation, these, events, led, to, mounting, economic, difficulties, because, kim, refused, to, issue, any, economic, or, political, reforms, as, he, aged, starting, in, the, 1970s, kim, developed, a, growth, on, the, right, side, of, the, back, of, his, neck, it, was, long, believed, that, its, close, proximity, to, his, brain, and, spinal, cord, made, it, inoperable, however, juan, reinaldo, s, nchez, a, defected, bodyguard, for, fidel, castro, who, met, kim, in, 1986, wrote, later, that, it, was, kim, s, own, paranoia, that, prevented, it, from, being, operated, on, because, of, its, unappealing, nature, north, korean, reporters, and, photographers, were, required, to, photograph, kim, while, standing, slightly, to, his, left, in, order, to, hide, the, growth, from, official, photographs, and, newsreels, hiding, the, growth, became, increasingly, difficult, as, the, growth, reached, the, size, of, a, baseball, by, the, late, 1980s, xii, to, ensure, a, full, succession, of, leadership, to, his, son, and, designated, successor, kim, jong, il, kim, turned, over, his, chairmanship, of, north, korea, s, national, defense, commission, the, body, mainly, responsible, for, control, of, the, armed, forces, as, well, as, the, supreme, commandership, of, the, country, s, now, million, man, strong, military, force, the, korean, people, s, army, to, his, son, in, 1991, and, 1993, so, far, the, elder, kim, even, though, he, is, dead, has, remained, the, country, s, president, and, the, chairman, of, the, party, s, central, military, commission, the, party, s, organization, that, has, supreme, supervision, and, authority, over, military, matters, in, early, 1994, kim, began, investing, in, nuclear, power, to, offset, energy, shortages, brought, on, by, economic, problems, this, was, the, first, of, many, nuclear, crises, on, 19, may, 1994, kim, ordered, spent, fuel, to, be, unloaded, from, the, already, disputed, nuclear, research, facility, in, yongbyon, despite, repeated, chiding, from, western, nations, kim, continued, to, conduct, nuclear, research, and, carry, on, with, the, uranium, enrichment, program, in, june, 1994, former, us, president, jimmy, carter, traveled, to, pyongyang, in, an, effort, to, persuade, kim, to, negotiate, with, the, clinton, administration, over, its, nuclear, program, to, the, astonishment, of, the, united, states, and, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, kim, agreed, to, halt, his, nuclear, research, program, and, seemed, to, be, embarking, upon, a, new, opening, to, the, west, shortly, before, noon, on, 7, july, 1994, kim, il, sung, collapsed, from, a, heart, attack, at, his, residence, in, hyangsan, north, pyongan, after, the, heart, attack, kim, jong, il, ordered, the, team, of, doctors, who, were, constantly, at, his, father, s, side, to, leave, and, arranged, for, the, country, s, best, doctors, to, be, flown, in, from, pyongyang, after, several, hours, the, doctors, from, pyongyang, arrived, but, despite, their, efforts, to, save, him, kim, il, sung, died, at, 02, 00, am, pst, on, 8, july, 1994, aged, 82, after, the, traditional, confucian, mourning, period, his, death, was, declared, 34, hours, later, kim, il, sung, s, death, resulted, in, nationwide, mourning, and, a, ten, day, mourning, period, was, declared, by, kim, jong, il, his, funeral, was, scheduled, to, be, held, on, 17, july, 1994, in, pyongyang, but, was, delayed, until, 19, july, it, was, attended, by, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, who, were, flown, into, the, city, from, all, over, north, korea, kim, il, sung, s, body, was, placed, in, a, public, mausoleum, at, the, kumsusan, palace, of, the, sun, where, his, preserved, and, embalmed, body, lies, under, a, glass, coffin, for, viewing, purposes, his, head, rests, on, a, traditional, korean, pillow, and, he, is, covered, by, the, flag, of, the, workers, party, of, korea, newsreel, video, of, the, funeral, at, pyongyang, was, broadcast, on, several, networks, and, can, now, be, found, on, various, websites, kim, il, sung, s, most, notable, contribution, to, political, theory, is, his, conceptualization, of, the, juche, idea, originally, described, as, a, variant, of, marxism, leninism, in, his, writings, kim, engaged, with, karl, marx, s, metaphor, that, religion, is, the, opium, of, the, people, he, did, so, both, in, the, context, of, responding, to, his, comrades, who, objected, to, working, with, religious, groups, chonbulygo, and, chondoism, respectively, in, the, first, instance, kim, replies, that, a, person, is, mistaken, if, he, or, she, believes, marx, s, proposition, regarding, opium, of, the, people, can, be, applied, in, all, instances, explaining, that, if, a, religion, prays, for, dealing, out, divine, punishment, to, japan, and, blessing, the, korean, nation, then, it, is, a, patriotic, religion, and, its, believers, are, patriots, in, the, second, kim, states, that, marx, s, metaphor, must, not, be, construed, radically, and, unilaterally, because, marx, was, warning, against, the, temptation, of, a, religious, mirage, and, not, opposing, believers, in, general, because, the, communist, movement, in, korea, was, fighting, a, struggle, for, national, salvation, against, japan, kim, writes, that, anyone, with, a, similar, agenda, can, join, the, struggle, and, that, even, a, religionist, must, be,
