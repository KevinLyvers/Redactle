roman, rites, at, the, council, of, bari, he, worked, for, the, primacy, of, canterbury, over, the, archbishop, of, york, and, over, the, bishops, of, wales, but, though, at, his, death, he, appeared, to, have, been, successful, pope, paschal, ii, later, reversed, papal, decisions, on, the, matter, and, restored, york, s, earlier, status, beginning, at, bec, anselm, composed, dialogues, and, treatises, with, a, rational, and, philosophical, approach, which, have, sometimes, caused, him, to, be, credited, as, the, founder, of, scholasticism, despite, his, lack, of, recognition, in, this, field, in, his, own, time, anselm, is, now, famous, as, the, originator, of, the, ontological, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, and, of, the, satisfaction, theory, of, atonement, anselm, was, born, in, or, around, aosta, in, upper, burgundy, sometime, between, april, 1033, and, april, 1034, the, area, now, forms, part, of, the, republic, of, italy, but, aosta, had, been, part, of, the, post, carolingian, kingdom, of, burgundy, until, the, death, of, the, childless, rudolph, iii, in, 1032, the, emperor, conrad, ii, and, odo, ii, count, of, blois, then, went, to, war, over, the, succession, humbert, the, white, handed, count, of, maurienne, so, distinguished, himself, that, he, was, granted, a, new, county, carved, out, of, the, secular, holdings, of, the, bishop, of, aosta, humbert, s, son, otto, was, subsequently, permitted, to, inherit, the, extensive, march, of, susa, through, his, wife, adelaide, in, preference, to, her, uncle, s, families, who, had, supported, the, effort, to, establish, an, independent, kingdom, of, italy, under, william, v, duke, of, aquitaine, otto, and, adelaide, s, unified, lands, then, controlled, the, most, important, passes, in, the, western, alps, and, formed, the, county, of, savoy, whose, dynasty, would, later, rule, the, kingdoms, of, sardinia, and, italy, records, during, this, period, are, scanty, but, both, sides, of, anselm, s, immediate, family, appear, to, have, been, dispossessed, by, these, decisions, in, favour, of, their, extended, relations, his, father, gundulph, or, gundulf, or, gondulphe, was, a, lombard, noble, probably, one, of, adelaide, s, arduinici, uncles, or, cousins, his, mother, ermenberge, was, almost, certainly, the, granddaughter, of, conrad, the, peaceful, related, both, to, the, anselmid, bishops, of, aosta, and, to, the, heirs, of, henry, ii, who, had, been, passed, over, in, favour, of, conrad, the, marriage, was, thus, probably, arranged, for, political, reasons, but, proved, ineffective, in, opposing, conrad, after, his, successful, annexation, of, burgundy, on, 1, august, 1034, bishop, burchard, subsequently, revolted, against, imperial, control, but, was, defeated, and, was, ultimately, translated, to, the, diocese, of, lyon, ermenberge, appears, to, have, been, the, wealthier, partner, in, the, marriage, gundulph, moved, to, his, wife, s, town, where, she, held, a, palace, most, likely, near, the, cathedral, along, with, a, villa, in, the, valley, anselm, s, father, is, sometimes, described, as, having, a, harsh, and, violent, temper, but, contemporary, accounts, merely, portray, him, as, having, been, overgenerous, or, careless, with, his, wealth, meanwhile, anselm, s, mother, ermenberge, patient, and, devoutly, religious, made, up, for, her, husband, s, faults, by, her, prudent, management, of, the, family, estates, in, later, life, there, are, records, of, three, relations, who, visited, bec, folceraldus, haimo, and, rainaldus, the, first, repeatedly, attempted, to, exploit, anselm, s, renown, but, was, rebuffed, since, he, already, had, his, ties, to, another, monastery, whereas, anselm, s, attempts, to, persuade, the, other, two, to, join, the, bec, community, were, unsuccessful, at, the, age, of, fifteen, anselm, felt, the, call, to, enter, a, monastery, but, failing, to, obtain, his, father, s, consent, he, was, refused, by, the, abbot, the, illness, he, then, suffered, has, been, considered, by, some, a, psychosomatic, effect, of, his, disappointment, but, upon, his, recovery, he, gave, up, his, studies, and, for, a, time, lived, a, carefree, life, following, the, death, of, his, mother, probably, at, the, birth, of, his, sister, richera, anselm, s, father, repented, his, own, earlier, lifestyle, but, professed, his, new, faith, with, a, severity, that, the, boy, found, likewise, unbearable, when, gundulph, entered, a, monastery, anselm, at, age, 23, left, home, with, a, single, attendant, crossed, the, alps, and, wandered, through, burgundy, and, france, for, three, years, his, countryman, lanfranc, of, pavia, was, then, prior, of, the, benedictine, abbey, of, bec, in, normandy, attracted, by, lanfranc, s, reputation, anselm, reached, normandy, in, 1059, after, spending, some, time, in, avranches, he, returned, the, next, year, his, father, having, died, he, consulted, with, lanfranc, as, to, whether, to, return, to, his, estates, and, employ, their, income, in, providing, alms, for, the, poor, or, to, renounce, them, becoming, a, hermit, or, a, monk, at, bec, or, cluny, given, what, he, saw, as, his, own, conflict, of, interest, lanfranc, sent, anselm, to, maurilius, the, archbishop, of, rouen, who, convinced, him, to, enter, bec, as, a, novice, at, the, age, of, 27, probably, in, his, first, year, he, wrote, his, first, work, on, philosophy, a, treatment, of, latin, paradoxes, called, the, grammarian, over, the, next, decade, the, rule, of, saint, benedict, reshaped, his, thought, three, years, later, in, 1063, duke, william, ii, summoned, lanfranc, to, serve, as, the, abbot, of, his, new, abbey, of, st, stephen, at, caen, and, the, monks, of, bec, despite, the, initial, hesitation, of, some, on, account, of, his, youth, elected, anselm, prior, a, notable, opponent, was, a, young, monk, named, osborne, anselm, overcame, his, hostility, first, by, praising, indulging, and, privileging, him, in, all, things, despite, his, hostility, and, then, when, his, affection, and, trust, were, gained, gradually, withdrawing, all, preference, until, he, upheld, the, strictest, obedience, along, similar, lines, he, remonstrated, with, a, neighbouring, abbot, who, complained, that, his, charges, were, incorrigible, despite, being, beaten, night, and, day, after, fifteen, years, in, 1078, anselm, was, unanimously, elected, as, bec, s, abbot, following, the, death, of, its, founder, the, warrior, monk, herluin, he, was, blessed, as, abbot, by, gilbert, d, arques, bishop, of, vreux, on, 22, february, 1079, under, anselm, s, direction, bec, became, the, foremost, seat, of, learning, in, europe, attracting, students, from, france, italy, and, elsewhere, during, this, time, he, wrote, the, monologion, and, proslogion, he, then, composed, a, series, of, dialogues, on, the, nature, of, truth, free, will, and, the, fall, of, satan, when, the, nominalist, roscelin, attempted, to, appeal, to, the, authority, of, lanfranc, and, anselm, at, his, trial, for, the, heresy, of, tritheism, at, soissons, in, 1092, anselm, composed, the, first, draft, of, de, fide, trinitatis, as, a, rebuttal, and, as, a, defence, of, trinitarianism, and, universals, the, fame, of, the, monastery, grew, not, only, from, his, intellectual, achievements, however, but, also, from, his, good, example, and, his, loving, kindly, method, of, discipline, particularly, with, the, younger, monks, there, was, also, admiration, for, his, spirited, defence, of, the, abbey, s, independence, from, lay, and, archiepiscopal, control, especially, in, the, face, of, robert, de, beaumont, earl, of, leicester, and, the, new, archbishop, of, rouen, william, bona, anima, following, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, devoted, lords, had, given, the, abbey, extensive, lands, across, the, channel, anselm, occasionally, visited, to, oversee, the, monastery, s, property, to, wait, upon, his, sovereign, william, i, of, england, formerly, duke, william, ii, of, normandy, and, to, visit, lanfranc, who, had, been, installed, as, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 1070, he, was, respected, by, william, i, and, the, good, impression, he, made, while, in, canterbury, made, him, the, favourite, of, its, cathedral, chapter, as, a, future, successor, to, lanfranc, instead, upon, the, archbishop, s, death, in, 1089, king, william, ii, william, rufus, or, william, the, red, refused, the, appointment, of, any, successor, and, appropriated, the, see, s, lands, and, revenues, for, himself, fearing, the, difficulties, that, would, attend, being, named, to, the, position, in, opposition, to, the, king, anselm, avoided, journeying, to, england, during, this, time, the, gravely, ill, hugh, earl, of, chester, finally, lured, him, over, with, three, pressing, messages, in, 1092, seeking, advice, on, how, best, to, handle, the, establishment, of, a, new, monastery, at, st, werburgh, s, hugh, was, recovered, by, the, time, of, anselm, s, arrival, but, he, was, occupied, four, or, five, months, by, his, assistance, he, then, travelled, to, his, former, pupil, gilbert, crispin, abbot, of, westminster, and, waited, apparently, delayed, by, the, need, to, assemble, the, donors, of, bec, s, new, lands, in, order, to, obtain, royal, approval, of, the, grants, at, christmas, william, ii, pledged, by, the, holy, face, of, lucca, that, neither, anselm, nor, any, other, would, sit, at, canterbury, while, he, lived, but, in, march, he, fell, seriously, ill, at, alveston, believing, his, sinful, behavior, was, responsible, he, summoned, anselm, to, hear, his, confession, and, administer, last, rites, he, published, a, proclamation, releasing, his, captives, discharging, his, debts, and, promising, to, henceforth, govern, according, to, the, law, on, 6, march, 1093, he, further, nominated, anselm, to, fill, the, vacancy, at, canterbury, the, clerics, gathered, at, court, acclaiming, him, forcing, the, crozier, into, his, hands, and, bodily, carrying, him, to, a, nearby, church, amid, a, te, deum, anselm, tried, to, refuse, on, the, grounds, of, age, and, ill, health, for, months, and, the, monks, of, bec, refused, to, give, him, permission, to, leave, them, negotiations, were, handled, by, the, recently, restored, bishop, william, of, durham, and, robert, count, of, meulan, on, 24, august, anselm, gave, king, william, the, conditions, under, which, he, would, accept, the, position, which, amounted, to, the, agenda, of, the, gregorian, reform, the, king, would, have, to, return, the, catholic, church, lands, which, had, been, seized, accept, his, spiritual, counsel, and, forswear, antipope, clement, iii, in, favour, of, urban, ii, william, rufus, was, exceedingly, reluctant, to, accept, these, conditions, he, consented, only, to, the, first, and, a, few, days, afterwards, reneged, on, that, suspending, preparations, for, anselm, s, investiture, public, pressure, forced, william, to, return, to, anselm, and, in, the, end, they, settled, on, a, partial, return, of, canterbury, s, lands, as, his, own, concession, anselm, received, dispensation, from, his, duties, in, normandy, did, homage, to, william, and, on, 25, september, 1093, was, enthroned, at, canterbury, cathedral, the, same, day, william, ii, finally, returned, the, lands, of, the, see, from, the, mid, 8th, century, it, had, become, the, custom, that, metropolitan, bishops, could, not, be, consecrated, without, a, woollen, pallium, given, or, sent, by, the, pope, himself, anselm, insisted, that, he, journey, to, rome, for, this, purpose, but, william, would, not, permit, it, amid, the, investiture, controversy, pope, gregory, vii, and, emperor, henry, iv, had, deposed, each, other, twice, bishops, loyal, to, henry, finally, elected, guibert, archbishop, of, ravenna, as, a, second, pope, in, france, philip, i, had, recognized, gregory, and, his, successors, victor, iii, and, urban, ii, but, guibert, as, clement, iii, held, rome, after, 1084, william, had, not, chosen, a, side, and, maintained, his, right, to, prevent, the, acknowledgement, of, either, pope, by, an, english, subject, prior, to, his, choice, in, the, end, a, ceremony, was, held, to, consecrate, anselm, as, archbishop, on, 4, december, without, the, pallium, as, archbishop, anselm, maintained, his, monastic, ideals, including, stewardship, prudence, and, proper, instruction, prayer, and, contemplation, anselm, advocated, for, reform, and, interests, of, canterbury, as, such, he, repeatedly, pressed, the, english, monarchy, for, support, of, the, reform, agenda, his, principled, opposition, to, royal, prerogatives, over, the, catholic, church, meanwhile, twice, led, to, his, exile, from, england, the, traditional, view, of, historians, has, been, to, see, anselm, as, aligned, with, the, papacy, against, lay, authority, and, anselm, s, term, in, office, as, the, english, theatre, of, the, investiture, controversy, begun, by, pope, gregory, vii, and, the, emperor, henry, iv, by, the, end, of, his, life, he, had, proven, successful, having, freed, canterbury, from, submission, to, the, english, king, received, papal, recognition, of, the, submission, of, wayward, york, and, the, welsh, bishops, and, gained, strong, authority, over, the, irish, bishops, he, died, before, the, canterbury, york, dispute, was, definitively, settled, however, and, pope, honorius, ii, finally, found, in, favour, of, york, instead, although, the, work, was, largely, handled, by, christ, church, s, priors, ernulf, 1096, 1107, and, conrad, 1108, 1126, anselm, s, episcopate, also, saw, the, expansion, of, canterbury, cathedral, from, lanfranc, s, initial, plans, the, eastern, end, was, demolished, and, an, expanded, choir, placed, over, a, large, and, well, decorated, crypt, doubling, the, cathedral, s, length, the, new, choir, formed, a, church, unto, itself, with, its, own, transepts, and, a, semicircular, ambulatory, opening, into, three, chapels, anselm, s, vision, was, of, a, catholic, church, with, its, own, internal, authority, which, clashed, with, william, ii, s, desire, for, royal, control, over, both, church, and, state, one, of, anselm, s, first, conflicts, with, william, came, in, the, month, he, was, consecrated, william, ii, was, preparing, to, wrest, normandy, from, his, elder, brother, robert, ii, and, needed, funds, anselm, was, among, those, expected, to, pay, him, he, offered, 500, but, william, refused, encouraged, by, his, courtiers, to, insist, on, 1000, as, a, kind, of, annates, for, anselm, s, elevation, to, archbishop, anselm, not, only, refused, he, further, pressed, the, king, to, fill, england, s, other, vacant, positions, permit, bishops, to, meet, freely, in, councils, and, to, allow, anselm, to, resume, enforcement, of, canon, law, particularly, against, incestuous, marriages, until, he, was, ordered, to, silence, when, a, group, of, bishops, subsequently, suggested, that, william, might, now, settle, for, the, original, sum, anselm, replied, that, he, had, already, given, the, money, to, the, poor, and, that, he, disdained, to, purchase, his, master, s, favour, as, he, would, a, horse, or, ass, the, king, being, told, this, he, replied, anselm, s, blessing, for, his, invasion, would, not, be, needed, as, i, hated, him, before, i, hate, him, now, and, shall, hate, him, still, more, hereafter, withdrawing, to, canterbury, anselm, began, work, on, the, cur, deus, homo, upon, william, s, return, anselm, insisted, that, he, travel, to, the, court, of, urban, ii, to, secure, the, pallium, that, legitimized, his, office, on, 25, february, 1095, the, lords, spiritual, and, temporal, of, england, met, in, a, council, at, rockingham, to, discuss, the, issue, the, next, day, william, ordered, the, bishops, not, to, treat, anselm, as, their, primate, or, as, canterbury, s, archbishop, as, he, openly, adhered, to, urban, the, bishops, sided, with, the, king, the, bishop, of, durham, presenting, his, case, and, even, advising, william, to, depose, and, exile, anselm, the, nobles, siding, with, anselm, the, conference, ended, in, deadlock, and, the, matter, was, postponed, immediately, following, this, william, secretly, sent, william, warelwast, and, gerard, to, italy, prevailing, on, urban, to, send, a, legate, bearing, canterbury, s, pallium, walter, bishop, of, albano, was, chosen, and, negotiated, in, secret, with, william, s, representative, the, bishop, of, durham, the, king, agreed, to, publicly, support, urban, s, cause, in, exchange, for, acknowledgement, of, his, rights, to, accept, no, legates, without, invitation, and, to, block, clerics, from, receiving, or, obeying, papal, letters, without, his, approval, william, s, greatest, desire, was, for, anselm, to, be, removed, from, office, walter, said, that, there, was, good, reason, to, expect, a, successful, issue, in, accordance, with, the, king, s, wishes, but, upon, william, s, open, acknowledgement, of, urban, as, pope, walter, refused, to, depose, the, archbishop, william, then, tried, to, sell, the, pallium, to, others, failed, tried, to, extract, a, payment, from, anselm, for, the, pallium, but, was, again, refused, william, then, tried, to, personally, bestow, the, pallium, to, anselm, an, act, connoting, the, church, s, subservience, to, the, throne, and, was, again, refused, in, the, end, the, pallium, was, laid, on, the, altar, at, canterbury, whence, anselm, took, it, on, 10, june, 1095, the, first, crusade, was, declared, at, the, council, of, clermont, in, november, despite, his, service, for, the, king, which, earned, him, rough, treatment, from, anselm, s, biographer, eadmer, upon, the, grave, illness, of, the, bishop, of, durham, in, december, anselm, journeyed, to, console, and, bless, him, on, his, deathbed, over, the, next, two, years, william, opposed, several, of, anselm, s, efforts, at, reform, including, his, right, to, convene, a, council, but, no, overt, dispute, is, known, however, in, 1094, the, welsh, had, begun, to, recover, their, lands, from, the, marcher, lords, and, william, s, 1095, invasion, had, accomplished, little, two, larger, forays, were, made, in, 1097, against, cadwgan, in, powys, and, gruffudd, in, gwynedd, these, were, also, unsuccessful, and, william, was, compelled, to, erect, a, series, of, border, fortresses, he, charged, anselm, with, having, given, him, insufficient, knights, for, the, campaign, and, tried, to, fine, him, in, the, face, of, william, s, refusal, to, fulfill, his, promise, of, church, reform, anselm, resolved, to, proceed, to, rome, where, an, army, of, french, crusaders, had, finally, installed, urban, in, order, to, seek, the, counsel, of, the, pope, william, again, denied, him, permission, the, negotiations, ended, with, anselm, being, given, the, choice, of, exile, or, total, submission, if, he, left, william, declared, he, would, seize, canterbury, and, never, again, receive, anselm, as, archbishop, if, he, were, to, stay, william, would, impose, his, fine, and, force, him, to, swear, never, again, to, appeal, to, the, papacy, anselm, chose, to, depart, in, october, 1097, although, anselm, retained, his, nominal, title, william, immediately, seized, the, revenues, of, his, bishopric, and, retained, them, til, death, from, lyon, anselm, wrote, to, urban, requesting, that, he, be, permitted, to, resign, his, office, urban, refused, but, commissioned, him, to, prepare, a, defence, of, the, western, doctrine, of, the, procession, of, the, holy, spirit, against, representatives, from, the, greek, church, anselm, arrived, in, rome, by, april, and, according, to, his, biographer, eadmer, lived, beside, the, pope, during, the, siege, of, capua, in, may, count, roger, s, saracen, troops, supposedly, offered, him, food, and, other, gifts, but, the, count, actively, resisted, the, clerics, attempts, to, convert, them, to, catholicism, at, the, council, of, bari, in, october, anselm, delivered, his, defence, of, the, filioque, and, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, in, the, eucharist, before, 185, bishops, although, this, is, sometimes, portrayed, as, a, failed, ecumenical, dialogue, it, is, more, likely, that, the, greeks, present, were, the, local, bishops, of, southern, italy, some, of, whom, had, been, ruled, by, constantinople, as, recently, as, 1071, the, formal, acts, of, the, council, have, been, lost, and, eadmer, s, account, of, anselm, s, speech, principally, consists, of, descriptions, of, the, bishops, vestments, but, anselm, later, collected, his, arguments, on, the, topic, as, de, processione, spiritus, sancti, under, pressure, from, their, norman, lords, the, italian, greeks, seem, to, have, accepted, papal, supremacy, and, anselm, s, theology, the, council, also, condemned, william, ii, eadmer, credited, anselm, with, restraining, the, pope, from, excommunicating, him, although, others, attribute, urban, s, politic, nature, anselm, was, present, in, a, seat, of, honour, at, the, easter, council, at, st, peter, s, in, rome, the, next, year, there, amid, an, outcry, to, address, anselm, s, situation, urban, renewed, bans, on, lay, investiture, and, on, clerics, doing, homage, anselm, departed, the, next, day, first, for, schiavi, where, he, completed, his, work, cur, deus, homo, and, then, for, lyon, william, rufus, was, killed, hunting, in, the, new, forest, on, 2, august, 1100, his, brother, henry, was, present, and, moved, quickly, to, secure, the, throne, before, the, return, of, his, elder, brother, robert, duke, of, normandy, from, the, first, crusade, henry, invited, anselm, to, return, pledging, in, his, letter, to, submit, himself, to, the, archbishop, s, counsel, the, cleric, s, support, of, robert, would, have, caused, great, trouble, but, anselm, returned, before, establishing, any, other, terms, than, those, offered, by, henry, once, in, england, anselm, was, ordered, by, henry, to, do, homage, for, his, canterbury, estates, and, to, receive, his, investiture, by, ring, and, crozier, anew, despite, having, done, so, under, william, the, bishop, now, refused, to, violate, canon, law, henry, for, his, part, refused, to, relinquish, a, right, possessed, by, his, predecessors, and, even, sent, an, embassy, to, pope, paschal, ii, to, present, his, case, paschal, reaffirmed, urban, s, bans, to, that, mission, and, the, one, that, followed, it, meanwhile, anselm, publicly, supported, henry, against, the, claims, and, threatened, invasion, of, his, brother, robert, curthose, anselm, wooed, wavering, barons, to, the, king, s, cause, emphasizing, the, religious, nature, of, their, oaths, and, duty, of, loyalty, he, supported, the, deposition, of, ranulf, flambard, the, disloyal, new, bishop, of, durham, and, he, threatened, robert, with, excommunication, the, lack, of, popular, support, greeting, his, invasion, near, portsmouth, compelled, robert, to, accept, the, treaty, of, alton, instead, renouncing, his, claims, for, an, annual, payment, of, 3000, marks, anselm, held, a, council, at, lambeth, palace, which, found, that, henry, s, beloved, matilda, had, not, technically, become, a, nun, and, was, thus, eligible, to, wed, and, become, queen, on, michaelmas, in, 1102, anselm, was, finally, able, to, convene, a, general, church, council, at, london, establishing, the, gregorian, reform, within, england, the, council, prohibited, marriage, concubinage, and, drunkenness, to, all, those, in, holy, orders, condemned, sodomy, and, simony, and, regulated, clerical, dress, anselm, also, obtained, a, resolution, against, the, british, slave, trade, henry, supported, anselm, s, reforms, and, his, authority, over, the, english, church, but, continued, to, assert, his, own, authority, over, anselm, upon, their, return, the, three, bishops, he, had, dispatched, on, his, second, delegation, to, the, pope, claimed, in, defiance, of, paschal, s, sealed, letter, to, anselm, his, public, acts, and, the, testimony, of, the, two, monks, who, had, accompanied, them, that, the, pontiff, had, been, receptive, to, henry, s, counsel, and, secretly, approved, of, anselm, s, submission, to, the, crown, in, 1103, then, anselm, consented, to, journey, himself, to, rome, along, with, the, king, s, envoy, william, warelwast, anselm, supposedly, travelled, in, order, to, argue, the, king, s, case, for, a, dispensation, but, in, response, to, this, third, mission, paschal, fully, excommunicated, the, bishops, who, had, accepted, investment, from, henry, though, sparing, the, king, himself, after, this, ruling, anselm, received, a, letter, forbidding, his, return, and, withdrew, to, lyon, to, await, paschal, s, response, on, 26, march, 1105, paschal, again, excommunicated, prelates, who, had, accepted, investment, from, henry, and, the, advisors, responsible, this, time, including, robert, de, beaumont, henry, s, chief, advisor, he, further, finally, threatened, henry, with, the, same, in, april, anselm, sent, messages, to, the, king, directly, and, through, his, sister, adela, expressing, his, own, willingness, to, excommunicate, henry, this, was, probably, a, negotiation, tactic, but, it, came, at, a, critical, period, in, henry, s, reign, and, it, worked, a, meeting, was, arranged, and, a, compromise, concluded, at, l, aigle, on, 22, july, 1105, henry, would, forsake, lay, investiture, if, anselm, obtained, paschal, s, permission, for, clerics, to, do, homage, for, their, lands, henry, s, bishops, and, counsellors, excommunications, were, to, be, lifted, provided, they, advise, him, to, obey, the, papacy, anselm, performed, this, act, on, his, own, authority, and, later, had, to, answer, for, it, to, paschal, the, revenues, of, canterbury, would, be, returned, to, the, archbishop, and, priests, would, no, longer, be, permitted, to, marry, anselm, insisted, on, the, agreement, s, ratification, by, the, pope, before, he, would, consent, to, return, to, england, but, wrote, to, paschal, in, favour, of, the, deal, arguing, that, henry, s, forsaking, of, lay, investiture, was, a, greater, victory, than, the, matter, of, homage, on, 23, march, 1106, paschal, wrote, anselm, accepting, the, terms, established, at, l, aigle, although, both, clerics, saw, this, as, a, temporary, compromise, and, intended, to, continue, pressing, for, reforms, including, the, ending, of, homage, to, lay, authorities, even, after, this, anselm, refused, to, return, to, england, henry, travelled, to, bec, and, met, with, him, on, 15, august, 1106, henry, was, forced, to, make, further, concessions, he, restored, to, canterbury, all, the, churches, that, had, been, seized, by, william, or, during, anselm, s, exile, promising, that, nothing, more, would, be, taken, from, them, and, even, providing, anselm, with, a, security, payment, henry, had, initially, taxed, married, clergy, and, when, their, situation, had, been, outlawed, had, made, up, the, lost, revenue, by, controversially, extending, the, tax, over, all, churchmen, he, now, agreed, that, any, prelate, who, had, paid, this, would, be, exempt, from, taxation, for, three, years, these, compromises, on, henry, s, part, strengthened, the, rights, of, the, church, against, the, king, anselm, returned, to, england, before, the, new, year, in, 1107, the, concordat, of, london, formalized, the, agreements, between, the, king, and, archbishop, henry, formally, renounced, the, right, of, english, kings, to, invest, the, bishops, of, the, church, the, remaining, two, years, of, anselm, s, life, were, spent, in, the, duties, of, his, archbishopric, he, succeeded, in, getting, paschal, to, send, the, pallium, for, the, archbishop, of, york, to, canterbury, so, that, future, archbishops, elect, would, have, to, profess, obedience, before, receiving, it, the, incumbent, archbishop, thomas, ii, had, received, his, own, pallium, directly, and, insisted, on, york, s, independence, from, his, deathbed, anselm, anathematized, all, who, failed, to, recognize, canterbury, s, primacy, over, all, the, english, church, this, ultimately, forced, henry, to, order, thomas, to, confess, his, obedience, to, anselm, s, successor, on, his, deathbed, he, announced, himself, content, except, that, he, had, a, treatise, in, mind, on, the, origin, of, the, soul, and, did, not, know, once, he, was, gone, if, another, was, likely, to, compose, it, he, died, on, holy, wednesday, 21, april, 1109, his, remains, were, translated, to, canterbury, cathedral, and, laid, at, the, head, of, lanfranc, at, his, initial, resting, place, to, the, south, of, the, altar, of, the, holy, trinity, now, st, thomas, s, chapel, during, the, church, s, reconstruction, after, the, disastrous, fire, of, the, 1170s, his, remains, were, relocated, although, it, is, now, uncertain, where, on, 23, december, 1752, archbishop, herring, was, contacted, by, count, perron, the, sardinian, ambassador, on, behalf, of, king, charles, emmanuel, who, requested, permission, to, translate, anselm, s, relics, to, italy, charles, had, been, duke, of, aosta, during, his, minority, herring, ordered, his, dean, to, look, into, the, matter, saying, that, while, the, parting, with, the, rotten, remains, of, a, rebel, to, his, king, a, slave, to, the, popedom, and, an, enemy, to, the, married, clergy, all, this, anselm, was, would, be, no, great, matter, he, likewise, should, make, no, conscience, of, palming, on, the, simpletons, any, other, old, bishop, with, the, name, of, anselm, the, ambassador, insisted, on, witnessing, the, excavation, however, and, resistance, on, the, part, of, the, prebendaries, seems, to, have, quieted, the, matter, they, considered, the, state, of, the, cathedral, s, crypts, would, have, offended, the, sensibilities, of, a, catholic, and, that, it, was, probable, that, anselm, had, been, removed, to, near, the, altar, of, ss, peter, and, paul, whose, side, chapel, to, the, right, i, e, south, of, the, high, altar, took, anselm, s, name, following, his, canonization, at, that, time, his, relics, would, presumably, have, been, placed, in, a, shrine, and, its, contents, disposed, of, during, the, reformation, the, ambassador, s, own, investigation, was, of, the, opinion, that, anselm, s, body, had, been, confused, with, archbishop, theobald, s, and, likely, remained, entombed, near, the, altar, of, the, virgin, mary, but, in, the, uncertainty, nothing, further, seems, to, have, been, done, then, or, when, inquiries, were, renewed, in, 1841, anselm, has, been, called, the, most, luminous, and, penetrating, intellect, between, st, augustine, and, st, thomas, aquinas, and, the, father, of, scholasticism, scotus, erigena, having, employed, more, mysticism, in, his, arguments, anselm, s, works, are, considered, philosophical, as, well, as, theological, since, they, endeavour, to, render, christian, tenets, of, faith, traditionally, taken, as, a, revealed, truth, as, a, rational, system, anselm, also, studiously, analyzed, the, language, used, in, his, subjects, carefully, distinguishing, the, meaning, of, the, terms, employed, from, the, verbal, forms, which, he, found, at, times, wholly, inadequate, his, worldview, was, broadly, neoplatonic, as, it, was, reconciled, with, christianity, in, the, works, of, st, augustine, and, pseudo, dionysius, with, his, understanding, of, aristotelian, logic, gathered, from, the, works, of, boethius, he, or, the, thinkers, in, northern, france, who, shortly, followed, him, including, abelard, william, of, conches, and, gilbert, of, poitiers, inaugurated, one, of, the, most, brilliant, periods, of, western, philosophy, innovating, logic, semantics, ethics, metaphysics, and, other, areas, of, philosophical, theology, anselm, held, that, faith, necessarily, precedes, reason, but, that, reason, can, expand, upon, faith, and, i, do, not, seek, to, understand, that, i, may, believe, but, believe, that, i, might, understand, for, this, too, i, believe, since, unless, i, first, believe, i, shall, not, understand, this, is, possibly, drawn, from, tractate, xxix, of, st, augustine, s, ten, homilies, on, the, first, epistle, of, john, regarding, john, 7, 14, 18, augustine, counseled, do, not, seek, to, understand, in, order, to, believe, but, believe, that, thou, may, understand, anselm, rephrased, the, idea, repeatedly, and, thomas, williams, sep, 2007, considered, that, his, aptest, motto, was, the, original, title, of, the, proslogion, faith, seeking, understanding, which, intended, an, active, love, of, god, seeking, a, deeper, knowledge, of, god, once, the, faith, is, held, fast, however, he, argued, an, attempt, must, be, made, to, demonstrate, its, truth, by, means, of, reason, to, me, it, seems, to, be, negligence, if, after, confirmation, in, the, faith, we, do, not, study, to, understand, that, which, we, believe, merely, rational, proofs, are, always, however, to, be, tested, by, scripture, and, he, employs, biblical, passages, and, what, we, believe, quod, credimus, at, times, to, raise, problems, or, to, present, erroneous, understandings, whose, inconsistencies, are, then, resolved, by, reason, stylistically, anselm, s, treatises, take, two, basic, forms, dialogues, and, sustained, meditations, in, both, he, strove, to, state, the, rational, grounds, for, central, aspects, of, christian, doctrines, as, a, pedagogical, exercise, for, his, initial, audience, of, fellow, monks, and, correspondents, the, subjects, of, anselm, s, works, were, sometimes, dictated, by, contemporary, events, such, as, his, speech, at, the, council, of, bari, or, the, need, to, refute, his, association, with, the, thinking, of, roscelin, but, he, intended, for, his, books, to, form, a, unity, with, his, letters, and, latter, works, advising, the, reader, to, consult, his, other, books, for, the, arguments, supporting, various, points, in, his, reasoning, it, seems, to, have, been, a, recurring, problem, that, early, drafts, of, his, works, were, copied, and, circulated, without, his, permission, while, at, bec, anselm, composed, while, archbishop, of, canterbury, he, composed, the, monologion, latin, monologium, monologue, originally, entitled, a, monologue, on, the, reason, for, faith, monoloquium, de, ratione, fidei, and, sometimes, also, known, as, an, example, of, meditation, on, the, reason, for, faith, exemplum, meditandi, de, ratione, fidei, was, written, in, 1075, and, 1076, it, follows, st, augustine, to, such, an, extent, that, gibson, argues, neither, boethius, nor, anselm, state, anything, which, was, not, already, dealt, with, in, greater, detail, by, augustine, s, de, trinitate, anselm, even, acknowledges, his, debt, to, that, work, in, the, monologion, s, prologue, however, he, takes, pains, to, present, his, reasons, for, belief, in, god, without, appeal, to, scriptural, or, patristic, authority, using, new, and, bold, arguments, he, attributes, this, style, and, the, book, s, existence, to, the, requests, of, his, fellow, monks, that, nothing, whatsoever, in, these, matters, should, be, made, convincing, by, the, authority, of, scripture, but, whatsoever, the, necessity, of, reason, would, concisely, prove, in, the, first, chapter, anselm, begins, with, a, statement, that, anyone, should, be, able, to, convince, themselves, of, the, existence, of, god, through, reason, alone, if, he, is, even, moderately, intelligent, he, argues, that, many, different, things, are, known, as, good, in, many, varying, kinds, and, degrees, these, must, be, understood, as, being, judged, relative, to, a, single, attribute, of, goodness, he, then, argues, that, goodness, is, itself, very, good, and, further, is, good, through, itself, as, such, it, must, be, the, highest, good, and, further, that, which, is, supremely, good, is, also, supremely, great, there, is, therefore, some, one, thing, that, is, supremely, good, and, supremely, great, in, other, words, supreme, among, all, existing, things, chapter, 2, follows, a, similar, argument, while, chapter, 3, argues, that, the, best, and, greatest, and, supreme, among, all, existing, things, must, be, responsible, for, the, existence, of, all, other, things, chapter, 4, argues, that, there, must, be, the, highest, level, of, dignity, among, existing, things, and, that, the, highest, level, must, have, a, single, member, therefore, there, is, a, certain, nature, or, substance, or, essence, who, through, himself, is, good, and, great, and, through, himself, is, what, he, is, through, whom, exists, whatever, truly, is, good, or, great, or, anything, at, all, and, who, is, the, supreme, good, the, supreme, great, thing, the, supreme, being, or, subsistent, that, is, supreme, among, all, existing, things, the, remaining, chapters, of, the, book, are, devoted, to, consideration, of, the, attributes, necessary, to, such, a, being, the, euthyphro, dilemma, although, not, addressed, by, that, name, is, dealt, with, as, a, false, dichotomy, god, is, taken, to, neither, conform, to, nor, invent, the, moral, order, but, to, embody, it, in, each, case, of, his, attributes, god, having, that, attribute, is, precisely, that, attribute, itself, a, letter, survives, of, anselm, responding, to, lanfranc, s, criticism, of, the, work, the, elder, cleric, took, exception, to, its, lack, of, appeals, to, scripture, and, authority, the, preface, of, the, proslogion, records, his, own, dissatisfaction, with, the, monologion, s, arguments, since, they, are, rooted, in, a, posteriori, evidence, and, inductive, reasoning, the, proslogion, latin, proslogium, discourse, originally, entitled, faith, seeking, understanding, fides, quaerens, intellectum, and, then, an, address, on, god, s, existence, alloquium, de, dei, existentia, was, written, over, the, next, two, years, 1077, 1078, it, is, written, in, the, form, of, an, extended, direct, address, to, god, it, grew, out, of, his, dissatisfaction, with, the, monologion, s, interlinking, and, contingent, arguments, his, single, argument, that, needed, nothing, but, itself, alone, for, proof, that, would, by, itself, be, enough, to, show, that, god, really, exists, is, commonly, taken, to, be, merely, the, second, chapter, of, the, work, in, it, anselm, reasoned, that, even, atheists, can, imagine, the, greatest, being, having, such, attributes, that, nothing, greater, could, exist, id, quo, nihil, maius, cogitari, possit, however, if, such, a, being, s, attributes, did, not, include, existence, a, still, greater, being, could, be, imagined, one, with, all, of, the, attributes, of, the, first, and, existence, therefore, the, truly, greatest, possible, being, must, necessarily, exist, further, this, necessarily, existing, greatest, being, must, be, god, who, therefore, necessarily, exists, this, reasoning, was, known, to, the, scholastics, as, anselm, s, argument, ratio, anselmi, but, it, became, known, as, the, ontological, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, following, kant, s, treatment, of, it, more, probably, anselm, intended, his, single, argument, to, include, most, of, the, rest, of, the, work, as, well, wherein, he, establishes, the, attributes, of, god, and, their, compatibility, with, one, another, continuing, to, construct, a, being, greater, than, which, nothing, else, can, be, conceived, anselm, proposes, such, a, being, must, be, just, truthful, happy, and, whatever, it, is, better, to, be, than, not, to, be, chapter, 6, specifically, enumerates, the, additional, qualities, of, awareness, omnipotence, mercifulness, impassibility, inability, to, suffer, and, immateriality, chapter, 11, self, existent, wisdom, goodness, happiness, and, permanence, and, chapter, 18, unity, anselm, addresses, the, question, begging, nature, of, greatness, in, this, formula, partially, by, appeal, to, intuition, and, partially, by, independent, consideration, of, the, attributes, being, examined, the, incompatibility, of, e, g, omnipotence, justness, and, mercifulness, are, addressed, in, the, abstract, by, reason, although, anselm, concedes, that, specific, acts, of, god, are, a, matter, of, revelation, beyond, the, scope, of, reasoning, at, one, point, during, the, 15th, chapter, he, reaches, the, conclusion, that, god, is, not, only, that, than, which, nothing, greater, can, be, thought, but, something, greater, than, can, be, thought, in, any, case, god, s, unity, is, such, that, all, of, his, attributes, are, to, be, understood, as, facets, of, a, single, nature, all, of, them, are, one, and, each, of, them, is, entirely, what, and, what, the, other, are, this, is, then, used, to, argue, for, the, triune, nature, of, the, god, jesus, and, the, one, love, common, to, and, son, that, is, the, holy, spirit, who, proceeds, from, both, the, last, three, chapters, are, a, digression, on, what, god, s, goodness, might, entail, extracts, from, the, work, were, later, compiled, under, the, name, meditations, or, the, manual, of, st, austin, the, argument, presented, in, the, proslogion, has, rarely, seemed, satisfactory, and, was, swiftly, opposed, by, gaunilo, a, monk, from, the, abbey, of, marmoutier, in, tours, his, book, for, the, fool, liber, pro, insipiente, argues, that, we, cannot, arbitrarily, pass, from, idea, to, reality, de, posse, ad, esse, not, fit, illatio, the, most, famous, of, gaunilo, s, objections, is, a, parody, of, anselm, s, argument, involving, an, island, greater, than, which, nothing, can, be, conceived, since, we, can, conceive, of, such, an, island, it, exists, in, our, understanding, and, so, must, exist, in, reality, this, is, however, absurd, since, its, shore, might, arbitrarily, be, increased, and, in, any, case, varies, with, the, tide, anselm, s, reply, responsio, or, apology, liber, apologeticus, does, not, address, this, argument, directly, which, has, led, klima, grzesik, and, others, to, construct, replies, for, him, and, led, wolterstorff, and, others, to, conclude, that, gaunilo, s, attack, is, definitive, anselm, however, considered, that, gaunilo, had, misunderstood, his, argument, in, each, of, gaunilo, s, four, arguments, he, takes, anselm, s, description, of, that, than, which, nothing, greater, can, be, thought, to, be, equivalent, to, that, which, is, greater, than, everything, else, that, can, be, thought, anselm, countered, that, anything, which, does, not, actually, exist, is, necessarily, excluded, from, his, reasoning, and, anything, which, might, or, probably, does, not, exist, is, likewise, aside, the, point, the, proslogion, had, already, stated, anything, else, whatsoever, other, than, can, be, thought, not, to, exist, the, proslogion, s, argument, concerns, and, can, only, concern, the, single, greatest, entity, out, of, all, existing, things, that, entity, both, must, exist, and, must, be, god, all, of, anselm, s, dialogues, take, the, form, of, a, lesson, between, a, gifted, and, inquisitive, student, and, a, knowledgeable, teacher, except, for, in, cur, deus, homo, the, student, is, not, identified, but, the, teacher, is, always, recognizably, anselm, himself, anselm, s, de, grammatico, on, the, grammarian, of, uncertain, date, deals, with, eliminating, various, paradoxes, arising, from, the, grammar, of, latin, nouns, and, adjectives, by, examining, the, syllogisms, involved, to, ensure, the, terms, in, the, premises, agree, in, meaning, and, not, merely, expression, the, treatment, shows, a, clear, debt, to, boethius, s, treatment, of, aristotle, between, 1080, and, 1086, while, still, at, bec, anselm, composed, the, dialogues, de, veritate, on, truth, de, libertate, arbitrii, on, the, freedom, of, choice, and, de, casu, diaboli, on, the, devil, s, fall, de, veritate, is, concerned, not, merely, with, the, truth, of, statements, but, with, correctness, in, will, action, and, essence, as, well, correctness, in, such, matters, is, understood, as, doing, what, a, thing, ought, or, was, designed, to, do, anselm, employs, aristotelian, logic, to, affirm, the, existence, of, an, absolute, truth, of, which, all, other, truth, forms, separate, kinds, he, identifies, this, absolute, truth, with, god, who, therefore, forms, the, fundamental, principle, both, in, the, existence, of, things, and, the, correctness, of, thought, as, a, corollary, he, affirms, that, everything, that, is, is, rightly, de, libertate, arbitrii, elaborates, anselm, s, reasoning, on, correctness, with, regard, to, free, will, he, does, not, consider, this, a, capacity, to, sin, but, a, capacity, to, do, good, for, its, own, sake, as, opposed, to, owing, to, coercion, or, for, self, interest, god, and, the, good, angels, therefore, have, free, will, despite, being, incapable, of, sinning, similarly, the, non, coercive, aspect, of, free, will, enabled, man, and, the, rebel, angels, to, sin, despite, this, not, being, a, necessary, element, of, free, will, itself, in, de, casu, diaboli, anselm, further, considers, the, case, of, the, fallen, angels, which, serves, to, discuss, the, case, of, rational, agents, in, general, the, teacher, argues, that, there, are, two, forms, of, good, justice, justicia, and, benefit, commodum, and, two, forms, of, evil, injustice, and, harm, incommodum, all, rational, beings, seek, benefit, and, shun, harm, on, their, own, account, but, independent, choice, permits, them, to, abandon, bounds, imposed, by, justice, some, angels, chose, their, own, happiness, in, preference, to, justice, and, were, punished, by, god, for, their, injustice, with, less, happiness, the, angels, who, upheld, justice, were, rewarded, with, such, happiness, that, they, are, now, incapable, of, sin, there, being, no, happiness, left, for, them, to, seek, in, opposition, to, the, bounds, of, justice, humans, meanwhile, retain, the, theoretical, capacity, to, will, justly, but, owing, to, the, fall, they, are, incapable, of, doing, so, in, practice, except, by, divine, grace, cur, deus, homo, why, god, was, a, man, was, written, from, 1095, to, 1098, once, anselm, was, already, archbishop, of, canterbury, as, a, response, for, requests, to, discuss, the, incarnation, it, takes, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, anselm, and, boso, one, of, his, students, its, core, is, a, purely, rational, argument, for, the, necessity, of, the, christian, mystery, of, atonement, the, belief, that, jesus, s, crucifixion, was, necessary, to, atone, for, mankind, s, sin, anselm, argues, that, owing, to, the, fall, and, mankind, s, fallen, nature, ever, since, humanity, has, offended, god, divine, justice, demands, restitution, for, sin, but, human, beings, are, incapable, of, providing, it, as, all, the, actions, of, men, are, already, obligated, to, the, furtherance, of, god, s, glory, further, god, s, infinite, justice, demands, infinite, restitution, for, the, impairment, of, his, infinite, dignity, the, enormity, of, the, offence, led, anselm, to, reject, personal, acts, of, atonement, even, peter, damian, s, flagellation, as, inadequate, and, ultimately, vain, instead, full, recompense, could, only, be, made, by, god, which, his, infinite, mercy, inclines, him, to, provide, atonement, for, humanity, however, could, only, be, made, through, the, figure, of, jesus, as, a, sinless, being, both, fully, divine, and, fully, human, taking, it, upon, himself, to, offer, his, own, life, on, our, behalf, his, crucifixion, accrues, infinite, worth, more, than, redeeming, mankind, and, permitting, it, to, enjoy, a, just, will, in, accord, with, its, intended, nature, this, interpretation, is, notable, for, permitting, divine, justice, and, mercy, to, be, entirely, compatible, and, has, exercised, immense, influence, over, church, doctrine, largely, supplanting, the, earlier, theory, developed, by, origen, and, gregory, of, nyssa, that, had, focused, primarily, on, satan, s, power, over, fallen, man, cur, deus, homo, is, often, accounted, anselm, s, greatest, work, but, the, legalist, and, amoral, nature, of, the, argument, along, with, its, neglect, of, the, individuals, actually, being, redeemed, has, been, criticized, both, by, comparison, with, the, treatment, by, abelard, and, for, its, subsequent, development, in, protestant, theology, anselm, s, de, fide, trinitatis, et, de,

incarnatione, verbi, letters, on, the, incarnation, of, the, word, was, written, in, two, drafts, in, 1092, and, 1094, it, defended, lanfranc, and, anselm, from, association, with, the, supposedly, tritheist, heresy, espoused, by, roscelin, of, compi, gne, as, well, as, arguing, in, favour, of, trinitarianism, and, universals, de, conceptu, virginali, et, de, originali, peccato, on, the, virgin, conception, and, original, sin, was, written, in, 1099, he, claimed, to, have, written, it, out, of, a, desire, to, expand, on, an, aspect, of, cur, deus, homo, for, his, student, and, friend, boso, and, takes, the, form, of, anselm, s, half, of, a, conversation, with, him, although, anselm, denied, belief, in, mary, s, immaculate, conception, his, thinking, laid, two, principles, which, formed, the, groundwork, for, that, dogma, s, development, the, first, is, that, it, was, proper, that, mary, should, be, so, pure, that, apart, from, god, no, purer, being, could, be, imagined, the, second, was, his, treatment, of, original, sin, earlier, theologians, had, held, that, it, was, transmitted, from, generation, to, generation, by, the, sinful, nature, of, sex, as, in, his, earlier, works, anselm, instead, held, that, adam, s, sin, was, borne, by, his, descendants, through, the, change, in, human, nature, which, occurred, during, the, fall, parents, were, unable, to, establish, a, just, nature, in, their, children, which, they, had, never, had, themselves, this, would, subsequently, be, addressed, in, mary, s, case, by, dogma, surrounding, the, circumstances, of, her, own, birth, de, processione, spiritus, sancti, contra, graecos, on, the, procession, of, the, holy, spirit, against, the, greeks, written, in, 1102, is, a, recapitulation, of, anselm, s, treatment, of, the, subject, at, the, council, of, bari, he, discussed, the, trinity, first, by, stating, that, human, beings, could, not, know, god, from, himself, but, only, from, analogy, the, analogy, that, he, used, was, the, self, consciousness, of, man, the, peculiar, double, nature, of, consciousness, memory, and, intelligence, represents, the, relation, of, the, father, to, the, son, the, mutual, love, of, these,

cum, libero, arbitrio, on, the, harmony, of, foreknowledge, and, predestination, and, the, grace, of, god, with, free, choice, was, written, from, 1107, to, 1108, like, the, de, conceptu, virginali, it, takes, the, form, of, a, single, narrator, in, a, dialogue, offering, presumable, objections, from, the, other, side, its, treatment, of, free, will, relies, on, anselm, s, earlier, works, but, goes, into, greater, detail, as, to, the, ways, in, which, there, is, no, actual, incompatibility, or, paradox, created, by, the, divine, attributes, in, its, 5th, chapter, anselm, reprises, his, consideration, of, eternity, from, the, monologion, although, nothing, is, there, except, what, is, present, it, is, not, the, temporal, present, like, ours, but, rather, the, eternal, within, which, all, times, altogether, are, contained, if, in, a, certain, way, the, present, time, contains, every, place, and, all, the, things, that, are, in, any, place, likewise, every, time, is, encompassed, in, the, eternal, present, and, everything, that, is, in, any, time, it, is, an, overarching, present, all, beheld, at, once, by, god, thus, permitting, both, his, foreknowledge, and, genuine, free, choice, on, the, part, of, mankind, fragments, survive, of, the, work, anselm, left, unfinished, at, his, death, which, would, have, been, a, dialogue, concerning, certain, pairs, of, opposites, including, ability, inability, possibility, impossibility, and, necessity, freedom, it, is, thus, sometimes, cited, under, the, name, de, potestate, et, impotentia, possibilitate, et, impossibilitate, necessitate, et, libertate, another, work, probably, left, unfinished, by, anselm, and, subsequently, revised, and, expanded, was, de, humanis, moribus, per, similitudines, on, mankind, s, morals, told, through, likenesses, or, de, similitudinibus, on, likenesses, a, collection, of, his, sayings, dicta, anselmi, was, compiled, probably, by, the, monk, alexander, he, also, composed, prayers, to, various, saints, anselm, wrote, nearly, 500, surviving, letters, epistolae, to, clerics, monks, relatives, and, others, the, earliest, being, those, written, to, the, norman, monks, who, followed, lanfranc, to, england, in, 1070, southern, asserts, that, all, of, anselm, s, letters, even, the, most, intimate, are, statements, of, his, religious, beliefs, consciously, composed, so, as, to, be, read, by, many, others, his, long, letters, to, waltram, bishop, of, naumberg, in, germany, epistolae, ad, walerannum, de, sacrificio, azymi, et, fermentati, on, unleavened, and, leavened, sacrifice, and, de, sacramentis, ecclesiae, on, the, church, s, sacraments, were, both, written, between, 1106, and, 1107, and, are, sometimes, bound, as, separate, books, although, he, seldom, asked, others, to, pray, for, him, two, of, his, letters, to, hermits, do, so, evidence, of, his, belief, in, their, spiritual, prowess, his, letters, of, guidance, one, to, hugh, a, hermit, near, caen, and, two, to, a, community, of, lay, nuns, endorse, their, lives, as, a, refuge, from, the, difficulties, of, the, political, world, with, which, anselm, had, to, contend, many, of, anselm, s, letters, contain, passionate, expressions, of, attachment, and, affection, often, addressed, to, the, beloved, lover, dilecto, dilectori, while, there, is, wide, agreement, that, anselm, was, personally, committed, to, the, monastic, ideal, of, celibacy, some, academics, such, as, mcguire, and, boswell, have, characterized, these, writings, as, expressions, of, a, homosexual, inclination, the, general, view, expressed, by, olsen, and, southern, sees, the, expressions, as, representing, a, wholly, spiritual, affection, nourished, by, an, incorporeal, ideal, two, biographies, of, anselm, were, written, shortly, after, his, death, by, his, chaplain, and, secretary, eadmer, vita, et, conversatione, anselmi, cantuariensis, and, the, monk, alexander, ex, dictis, beati, anselmi, eadmer, also, detailed,

influence, on, the, scholastics, including, bonaventure, thomas, aquinas, duns, scotus, and, william, of, ockham, his, thoughts, have, guided, much, subsequent, discussion, on, the, procession, of, the, holy, spirit, and, the, atonement, his, work, also, anticipates, much, of, the, later, controversies, over, free, will, and, predestination, an, extensive, debate, occurred, primarily, among, french, scholars, in, the, early, 1930s, about, nature, and, possibility, of, christian, philosophy, which, drew, strongly, on, anselm, s, work, modern, scholarship, remains, sharply, divided, over, the, nature, of, anselm, s, episcopal, leadership, some, including, fr, hlich, and, schmitt, argue, for, anselm, s, attempts, to, manage, his, reputation, as, a, devout, scholar, and, cleric, minimizing, the, worldly, conflicts, he, found, himself, forced, into, vaughn, and, others, argue, that, the, carefully, nurtured, image, of, simple, holiness, and, profound, thinking, was, precisely, employed, as, a, tool, by, an, adept, disingenuous, political, operator, while, the, traditional, view, of, the, pious, and, reluctant, church, leader, recorded, by, eadmer, one, who, genuinely, nursed, a, deep, seated, horror, of, worldly, advancement, is, upheld, by, southern, among, others, anselm, s, hagiography, records, that, when, a, child, he, had, a, miraculous, vision, of, god, on,
