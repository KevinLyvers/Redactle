part, i, might, join, but, swayed, by, an, overmastering, impulse, within, me, and, a, desire, long, cherished, in, my, bosom, to, visit, these, illustrious, sanctuaries, so, i, braced, my, resolution, to, quit, my, dear, ones, female, and, male, and, forsook, my, home, as, birds, forsake, their, nests, my, parents, being, yet, in, the, bonds, of, life, it, weighed, sorely, upon, me, to,

part, of, the, bahri, mamluk, empire, he, met, two, ascetic, pious, men, in, alexandria, one, was, sheikh, burhanuddin, who, is, supposed, to, have, foretold, the, destiny, of, ibn, battuta, as, a,

travelling, through, syria, the, diversion, held, an, added, advantage, because, of, the, holy, places, that, lay, along, the, way, including, hebron, jerusalem, and, bethlehem, the, mamluk,

city, in, the, region, to, open, its, gates, to, the, mongols, and, by, then, an, important, trading, centre, as, most, of, its, nearby, rivals, had, been, razed, by, the, mongol, invaders, ibn,

about, three, years, from, september, 1327, until, autumn, 1330, problems, with, chronology, however, lead, commentators, to, suggest, that, he, may, have, left, after, the, 1328, hajj, after, the, hajj, in, either, 1328, or, 1330, he, made, his, way, to, the, port, of, jeddah, on, the, red, sea, coast, from, there, he, followed, the, coast, in, a, series, of, boats, known, as, a, jalbah, these,

legendary, ali, ibn, al, hassan, shirazi, he, further, wrote, that, the, authority, of, the, sultan, extended, from, malindi, in, the, north, to, inhambane, in, the, south, and, was, particularly, impressed, by, the, planning, of, the, city, believing, it, to, be, the, reason, for, kilwa, s, success, along, the, coast, during, this, period, he, described, the, construction, of, the, palace, of, husuni, kubwa, and, a, significant, extension, to, the, great, mosque, of, kilwa, which, was, made, of, coral, stones, and, was, the, largest, mosque, of, its, kind, with, a, change, in, the, monsoon,

in, delhi, due, to, lack, of, islamic, appeal, in, india, it, is, uncertain, by, which, route, ibn, battuta, entered, the, indian, subcontinent, but, it, is, known, that, he, was, kidnapped, and,

under, suspicion, of, treason, for, a, variety, of, offences, his, plan, to, leave, on, the, pretext, of, taking, another, hajj, was, stymied, by, the, sultan, the, opportunity, for, battuta, to, leave, delhi, finally, arose, in, 1341, when, an, embassy, arrived, from, the, yuan, dynasty, of, china, asking, for, permission, to, rebuild, a, himalayan, buddhist, temple, popular, with, chinese, pilgrims, ibn, battuta, was, given, charge, of, the, embassy, but, en, route, to, the, coast, at, the, start, of, the, journey, to, china, he, and, his, large, retinue, were, attacked, by, a, group,

to, the, arabian, sea, this, area, is, today, known, as, hosapattana, and, lies, in, the, honnavar, taluk, of, uttara, kannada, following, the, overthrow, of, the, sultanate, ibn, battuta, had, no, choice, but, to, leave, india, although, determined, to, continue, his, journey, to, china, he, first, took, a, detour, to, visit, the, maldive, islands, where, he, worked, as, a, judge, he, spent, nine, months, on, the, islands, much, longer, than, he, had, intended, when, he, arrived, at, the, capital, mal, ibn, battuta, did, not, plan, to, stay, however, the, leaders, of, the, formerly, buddhist, nation, that, had, recently, converted, to, islam, were, looking, for, a, chief, judge, someone, who, knew, arabic, and, the, qur, an, to, convince, him, to, stay, they, gave, him, pearls, gold, jewellery, and, slaves, while, at, the, same, time, making, it, impossible, for, him, to, leave, by, ship, compelled, into, staying, he, became, a, chief, judge, and, married, into, the, royal, family, of, omar, i, ibn, battuta, took, on, his, duties, as, a, judge, with, keenness, and, strived, to, transform, local, practices, to, conform, to, a, stricter, application, of, muslim, law, he, commanded, that, men, who, did, not, attend, friday, prayer, be, publicly, whipped, and, that, robbers, right, hand, be, cut, off, he, forbade, women, from, being, topless, in, public, which, had, previously, been, the, custom, however, these, and, other, strict, judgments, began, to, antagonize, the, island, nation, s, rulers, and, involved, him, in, power, struggles, and, political, intrigues, ibn, battuta, resigned, from, his, job, as, chief, qadi, although, in, all, likelihood, it, was, inevitable, that, he, would, have, been, dismissed, throughout, his, travels, ibn, battuta, kept, close, company, with, women, usually, taking, a, wife, whenever, he, stopped, for, any, length, of, time, at, one, place, and, then, divorcing, her, when, he, moved, on, while, in, the, maldives, ibn, battuta, took, four, wives, in, his, travels, he, wrote, that, in, the, maldives, the, effect, of, small, dowries, and, female, non, mobility, combined, to, in, effect, make, a, marriage, a, convenient, temporary, arrangement, for, visiting, male, travellers, and, sailors, from, the, maldives, he, carried, on, to, sri, lanka, and, visited, sri, pada, and, tenavaram, temple,

bangladesh, intending, to, travel, to, sylhet, to, meet, shah, jalal, who, became, so, renowned, that, ibn, battuta, then, in, chittagong, made, a, one, month, journey, through, the, mountains, of, kamaru, near, sylhet, to, meet, him, on, his, way, to, sylhet, ibn, battuta, was, greeted, by, several, of, shah, jalal, s, disciples, who, had, come, to, assist, him, on, his, journey, many, days, before, he, had, arrived, at, the, meeting, in, 1345, ce, ibn, battuta, noted, that, shah, jalal, was, tall, and, lean, fair, in, complexion, and, lived, by, the, mosque, in, a, cave, where, his, only, item, of, value, was, a, goat, he, kept, for, milk, butter, and, yogurt, he, observed, that, the, companions, of, the, shah, jalal, were, foreign, and, known, for, their, strength, and, bravery, he, also, mentions, that, many, people, would, visit, the, shah, to, seek, guidance, ibn, battuta, went, further, north, into, assam, then, turned, around, and, continued, with, his, original, plan, in, 1345, ibn, battuta, traveled, to, samudra, pasai, sultanate, called, al, jawa, in, present, day, aceh, northern, sumatra, after, 40, days, voyage, from, sunur, kawan, he, notes, in, his, travel, log, that, the, ruler, of, samudra, pasai, was, a, pious, muslim, named, sultan, al, malik, al, zahir, jamal, ad, din, who, performed, his, religious, duties, with, utmost, zeal, and, often, waged, campaigns, against, animists, in, the, region, the, island, of, sumatra, according, to, ibn, battuta, was, rich, in, camphor, areca, nut, cloves, and, tin, the, madh, hab, he, observed, was, imam, al, shafi, i, whose, customs, were, similar, to, those, he, had, previously, seen, in, coastal, india, especially, among, the, mappila, muslims, who, were, also, followers, of, imam, al, shafi, i, at, that, time, samudra, pasai, marked, the, end, of, dar, al, islam, because, no, territory, east, of, this, was, ruled, by, a, muslim, here, he, stayed, for, about, two, weeks, in, the, wooden, walled, town, as, a, guest, of, the, sultan, and, then, the, sultan, provided, him, with, supplies, and, sent, him, on, his, way, on, one, of, his, own, junks, to, china, ibn, battuta, first, sailed, for, 21, days, to, a, place, called, mul, jawa, island, of, java, or, majapahit, java, which, was, a, center, of, a, hindu, empire, the, empire, spanned, 2, months, of, travel, and, ruled, over, the, country, of, qaqula, and, qamara, he, arrived, at, the, walled, city, named, qaqula, kakula, and, observed, that, the, city, had, war, junks, for, pirate, raiding, and, collecting, tolls, and, that, elephants, were, employed, for, various, purposes, he, met, the, ruler, of, mul, jawa, and, stayed, as, a, guest, for, three, days, ibn, battuta, then, sailed, to, a, state, called, kaylukari, in, the, land, of, tawalisi, where, he, met, urduja, a, local, princess, urduja, was, a, brave, warrior, and, her, people, were, opponents, of, the, yuan, dynasty, she, was, described, as, an, idolater, but, could, write, the, phrase, bismillah, in, islamic, calligraphy, the, locations, of, kaylukari, and, tawalisi, are, disputed, kaylukari, might, referred, to, po, klong, garai, in, champa, now, southern, vietnam, and, urduja, might, be, an, aristocrat, of, champa, or, dai, viet, filipinos, widely, believe, that, kaylukari, was, in, present, day, pangasinan, province, of, the, philippines, their, opposition, to, the, mongols, might, indicate, 2, possible, locations, japan, and, java, majapahit, in, modern, times, urduja, has, been, featured, in, filipino, textbooks, and, films, as, a, national, heroine, numerous, other, locations, have, been, proposed, ranging, from, java, to, somewhere, in, guangdong, province, china, however, sir, henry, yule, and, william, henry, scott, consider, both, tawalisi, and, urduja, to, be, entirely, fictitious, see, tawalisi, for, details, from, kaylukari, ibn, battuta, finally, reached, quanzhou, in, fujian, province, china, in, the, year, 1345, ibn, battuta, arrived, at, quanzhou, in, china, s, fujian, province, then, under, the, rule, of, the, mongol, led, yuan, dynasty, one, of, the, first, things, he, noted, was, that, muslims, referred, to, the, city, as, zaitun, meaning, olive, but, ibn, battuta, could, not, find, any, olives, anywhere, he, mentioned, local, artists, and, their, mastery, in, making, portraits, of, newly, arrived, foreigners, these, were, for, security, purposes, ibn, battuta, praised, the, craftsmen, and, their, silk, and, porcelain, as, well, as, fruits, such, as, plums, and, watermelons, and, the, advantages, of, paper, money, he, described, the, manufacturing, process, of, large, ships, in, the, city, of, quanzhou, he, also, mentioned, chinese, cuisine, and, its, use, of, animals, such, as, frogs, pigs, and, even, dogs, which, were, sold, in, the, markets, and, noted, that, the, chickens, in, china, were, larger, than, those, in, the, west, scholars, however, have, pointed, out, numerous, errors, given, in, ibn, battuta, s, account, of, china, for, example, confusing, the, yellow, river, with, the, grand, canal, and, other, waterways, as, well, as, believing, that, porcelain, was, made, from, coal, in, quanzhou, ibn, battuta, was, welcomed, by, the, head, of, the, local, muslim, merchants, possibly, a, f, nzh, ng, or, leader, of, foreigners, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, f, nzh, ng, and, sheikh, al, islam, imam, who, came, to, meet, him, with, flags, drums, trumpets, and, musicians, ibn, battuta, noted, that, the, muslim, populace, lived, within, a, separate, portion, in, the, city, where, they, had, their, own, mosques, bazaars, and, hospitals, in, quanzhou, he, met, two, prominent, iranians, burhan, al, din, of, kazerun, and, sharif, al, din, from, tabriz, both, of, whom, were, influential, figures, noted, in, the, yuan, history, as, a, mi, li, ding, and, sai, fu, ding, respectively, while, in, quanzhou, he, ascended, the, mount, of, the, hermit, and, briefly, visited, a, well, known, taoist, monk, in, a, cave, he, then, travelled, south, along, the, chinese, coast, to, guangzhou, where, he, lodged, for, two, weeks, with, one, of, the, city, s, wealthy, merchants, from, guangzhou, he, went, north, to, quanzhou, and, then, proceeded, to, the, city, of, fuzhou, where, he, took, up, residence, with, zahir, al, din, and, met, kawam, al, din, and, a, fellow, countryman, named, al, bushri, of, ceuta, who, had, become, a, wealthy, merchant, in, china, al, bushri, accompanied, ibn, battuta, northwards, to, hangzhou, and, paid, for, the, gifts, that, ibn, battuta, would, present, to, the, emperor, huizong, of, yuan, ibn, battuta, said, that, hangzhou, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, he, had, ever, seen, and, he, noted, its, charm, describing, that, the, city, sat, on, a, beautiful, lake, surrounded, by, gentle, green, hills, he, mentions, the, city, s, muslim, quarter, and, resided, as, a, guest, with, a, family, of, egyptian, origin, during, his, stay, at, hangzhou, he, was, particularly, impressed, by, the, large, number, of, well, crafted, and, well, painted, chinese, wooden, ships, with, coloured, sails, and, silk, awnings, assembling, in, the, canals, later, he, attended, a, banquet, of, the, yuan, administrator, of, the, city, named, qurtai, who, according, to, ibn, battuta, was, very, fond, of, the, skills, of, local, chinese, conjurers, ibn, battuta, also, mentions, locals, who, worshipped, a, solar, deity, he, described, floating, through, the, grand, canal, on, a, boat, watching, crop, fields, orchids, merchants, in, black, silk, and, women, in, flowered, silk, and, priests, also, in, silk, in, beijing, ibn, battuta, referred, to, himself, as, the, long, lost, ambassador, from, the, delhi, sultanate, and, was, invited, to, the, yuan, imperial, court, of, emperor, huizong, who, according, to, ibn, battuta, was, worshipped, by, some, people, in, china, ibn, batutta, noted, that, the, palace, of, khanbaliq, was, made, of, wood, and, that, the, ruler, s, head, wife, empress, qi, held, processions, in, her, honour, ibn, battuta, also, wrote, he, had, heard, of, the, rampart, of, yajuj, and, majuj, that, was, sixty, days, travel, from, the, city, of, zeitun, quanzhou, hamilton, alexander, rosskeen, gibb, notes, that, ibn, battuta, believed, that, the, great, wall, of, china, was, built, by, dhul, qarnayn, to, contain, gog, and, magog, as, mentioned, in, the, quran, however, ibn, battuta, who, asked, about, the, wall, in, china, could, find, no, one, who, had, either, seen, it, or, knew, of, anyone, who, had, seen, it, ibn, battuta, travelled, from, beijing, to, hangzhou, and, then, proceeded, to, fuzhou, upon, his, return, to, quanzhou, he, soon, boarded, a, chinese, junk, owned, by, the, sultan, of, samudera, pasai, sultanate, heading, for, southeast, asia, whereupon, ibn, battuta, was, unfairly, charged, a, hefty, sum, by, the, crew, and, lost, much, of, what, he, had, collected, during, his, stay, in, china, battuta, claimed, that, the, emperor, huizong, of, yuan, had, interred, with, him, in, his, grave, six, slave, soldiers, and, four, girl, slaves, silver, gold, weapons, and, carpets, were, put, into, the, grave, after, returning, to, quanzhou, in, 1346, ibn, battuta, began, his, journey, back, to, morocco, in, kozhikode, he, once, again, considered, throwing, himself, at, the, mercy, of, muhammad, bin, tughluq, in, delhi, but, thought, better, of, it, and, decided, to, carry, on, to, mecca, on, his, way, to, basra, he, passed, through, the, strait, of, hormuz, where, he, learned, that, abu, sa, id, last, ruler, of, the, ilkhanate, dynasty, had, died, in, iran, abu, sa, id, s, territories, had, subsequently, collapsed, due, to, a, fierce, civil, war, between, the, iranians, and, mongols, in, 1348, ibn, battuta, arrived, in, damascus, with, the, intention, of, retracing, the, route, of, his, first, hajj, he, then, learned, that, his, father, had, died, 15, years, earlier, and, death, became, the, dominant, theme, for, the, next, year, or, so, the, black, death, had, struck, and, he, stopped, in, homs, as, the, plague, spread, through, syria, palestine, and, arabia, he, heard, of, terrible, death, tolls, in, gaza, but, returned, to, damascus, that, july, where, the, death, toll, had, reached, 2, 400, victims, each, day, when, he, stopped, in, gaza, he, found, it, was, depopulated, and, in, egypt, he, stayed, at, abu, sir, reportedly, deaths, in, cairo, had, reached, levels, of, 1, 100, each, day, he, made, hajj, to, mecca, then, he, decided, to, return, to, morocco, nearly, a, quarter, of, a, century, after, leaving, home, on, the, way, he, made, one, last, detour, to, sardinia, then, in, 1349, returned, to, tangier, by, way, of, fez, only, to, discover, that, his, mother, had, also, died, a, few, months, before, after, a, few, days, in, tangier, ibn, battuta, set, out, for, a, trip, to, the, muslim, controlled, territory, of, al, andalus, on, the, iberian, peninsula, king, alfonso, xi, of, castile, and, le, n, had, threatened, to, attack, gibraltar, so, in, 1350, ibn, battuta, joined, a, group, of, muslims, leaving, tangier, with, the, intention, of, defending, the, port, by, the, time, he, arrived, the, black, death, had, killed, alfonso, and, the, threat, of, invasion, had, receded, so, he, turned, the, trip, into, a, sight, seeing, tour, ending, up, in, granada, after, his, departure, from, al, andalus, he, decided, to, travel, through, morocco, on, his, return, home, he, stopped, for, a, while, in, marrakech, which, was, almost, a, ghost, town, following, the, recent, plague, and, the, transfer, of, the, capital, to, fez, in, the, autumn, of, 1351, ibn, battuta, left, fez, and, made, his, way, to, the, town, of, sijilmasa, on, the, northern, edge, of, the, sahara, in, present, day, morocco, there, he, bought, a, number, of, camels, and, stayed, for, four, months, he, set, out, again, with, a, caravan, in, february, 1352, and, after, 25, days, arrived, at, the, dry, salt, lake, bed, of, taghaza, with, its, salt, mines, all, of, the, local, buildings, were, made, from, slabs, of, salt, by, the, slaves, of, the, masufa, tribe, who, cut, the, salt, in, thick, slabs, for, transport, by, camel, taghaza, was, a, commercial, centre, and, awash, with, malian, gold, though, ibn, battuta, did, not, form, a, favourable, impression, of, the, place, recording, that, it, was, plagued, by, flies, and, the, water, was, brackish, after, a, ten, day, stay, in, taghaza, the, caravan, set, out, for, the, oasis, of, tasarahla, probably, bir, al, ksaib, where, it, stopped, for, three, days, in, preparation, for, the, last, and, most, difficult, leg, of, the, journey, across, the, vast, desert, from, tasarahla, a, masufa, scout, was, sent, ahead, to, the, oasis, town, of, oualata, where, he, arranged, for, water, to, be, transported, a, distance, of, four, days, travel, where, it, would, meet, the, thirsty, caravan, oualata, was, the, southern, terminus, of, the, trans, saharan, trade, route, and, had, recently, become, part, of, the, mali, empire, altogether, the, caravan, took, two, months, to, cross, the, 1, 600, km, 990, mi, of, desert, from, sijilmasa, from, there, ibn, battuta, travelled, southwest, along, a, river, he, believed, to, be, the, nile, it, was, actually, the, niger, river, until, he, reached, the, capital, of, the, mali, empire, there, he, met, mansa, suleyman, king, since, 1341, ibn, battuta, disapproved, of, the, fact, that, female, slaves, servants, and, even, the, daughters, of, the, sultan, went, about, exposing, parts, of, their, bodies, not, befitting, a, muslim, he, wrote, in, his, rihla, that, black, africans, were, characterised, by, ill, manners, and, contempt, for, white, men, and, that, he, was, long, astonished, at, their, feeble, intellect, and, their, respect, for, mean, things, he, left, the, capital, in, february, accompanied, by, a, local, malian, merchant, and, journeyed, overland, by, camel, to, timbuktu, though, in, the, next, two, centuries, it, would, become, the, most, important, city, in, the, region, at, that, time, it, was, a, small, city, and, relatively, unimportant, it, was, during, this, journey, that, ibn, battuta, first, encountered, a, hippopotamus, the, animals, were, feared, by, the, local, boatmen, and, hunted, with, lances, to, which, strong, cords, were, attached, after, a, short, stay, in, timbuktu, ibn, battuta, journeyed, down, the, niger, to, gao, in, a, canoe, carved, from, a, single, tree, at, the, time, gao, was, an, important, commercial, center, after, spending, a, month, in, gao, ibn, battuta, set, off, with, a, large, caravan, for, the, oasis, of, takedda, on, his, journey, across, the, desert, he, received, a, message, from, the, sultan, of, morocco, commanding, him, to, return, home, he, set, off, for, sijilmasa, in, september, 1353, accompanying, a, large, caravan, transporting, 600, female, slaves, and, arrived, back, in, morocco, early, in, 1354, ibn, battuta, s, itinerary, gives, scholars, a, glimpse, as, to, when, islam, first, began, to, spread, into, the, heart, of, west, africa, after, returning, home, from, his, travels, in, 1354, and, at, the, suggestion, of, the, marinid, ruler, of, morocco, abu, inan, faris, ibn, battuta, dictated, an, account, in, arabic, of, his, journeys, to, ibn, juzayy, a, scholar, whom, he, had, previously, met, in, granada, the, account, is, the, only, source, for, ibn, battuta, s, adventures, the, full, title, of, the, manuscript, may, be, translated, as, a, masterpiece, to, those, who, contemplate, the, wonders, of, cities, and, the, marvels, of, travelling, tu, fat, an, nu, r, f, ghar, ib, al, am, r, wa, aj, ib, al, asf, r, however, it, is, often, simply, referred, to, as, the, travels, rihla, in, reference, to, a, standard, form, of, arabic, literature, there, is, no, indication, that, ibn, battuta, made, any, notes, or, had, any, journal, during, his, twenty, nine, years, of, travelling, when, he, came, to, dictate, an, account, of, his, experiences, he, had, to, rely, on, memory, and, manuscripts, produced, by, earlier, travellers, ibn, juzayy, did, not, acknowledge, his, sources, and, presented, some, of, the, earlier, descriptions, as, ibn, battuta, s, own, observations, when, describing, damascus, mecca, medina, and, some, other, places, in, the, middle, east, he, clearly, copied, passages, from, the, account, by, the, andalusian, ibn, jubayr, which, had, been, written, more, than, 150, years, earlier, similarly, most, of, ibn, juzayy, s, descriptions, of, places, in, palestine, were, copied, from, an, account, by, the, 13th, century, traveller, muhammad, al, abdari, scholars, do, not, believe, that, ibn, battuta, visited, all, the, places, he, described, and, argue, that, in, order, to, provide, a, comprehensive, description, of, places, in, the, muslim, world, he, relied, on, hearsay, evidence, and, made, use, of, accounts, by, earlier, travellers, for, example, it, is, considered, very, unlikely, that, ibn, battuta, made, a, trip, up, the, volga, river, from, new, sarai, to, visit, bolghar, and, there, are, serious, doubts, about, a, number, of, other, journeys, such, as, his, trip, to, sana, a, in, yemen, his, journey, from, balkh, to, bistam, in, khorasan, and, his, trip, around, anatolia, ibn, battuta, s, claim, that, a, maghrebian, called, abu, l, barakat, the, berber, converted, the, maldives, to, islam, is, contradicted, by, an, entirely, different, story, which, says, that, the, maldives, were, converted, to, islam, after, miracles, were, performed, by, a, tabrizi, named, maulana, shaikh, yusuf, shams, ud, din, according, to, the, tarikh, the, official, history, of, the, maldives, some, scholars, have, also, questioned, whether, he, really, visited, china, ibn, battuta, may, have, plagiarized, entire, sections, of, his, descriptions, of, china, lifted, from, works, by, other, authors, like, masalik, al, absar, fi, mamalik, al, amsar, by, shihab, al, umari, sulaiman, al, tajir, and, possibly, from, al, juwayni, rashid, al, din, and, an, alexander, romance, furthermore, ibn, battuta, s, description, and, marco, polo, s, writings, share, extremely, similar, sections, and, themes, with, some, of, the, same, commentary, e, g, it, is, unlikely, that, the, 3rd, caliph, uthman, ibn, affan, had, someone, with, the, identical, name, in, china, who, was, encountered, by, ibn, battuta, however, even, if, the, rihla, is, not, fully, based, on, what, its, author, personally, witnessed, it, provides, an, important, account, of, much, of, the, 14th, century, world, concubines, were, used, by, ibn, battuta, such, as, in, delhi, 111, 113, 137, 141, 238, he, wedded, several, women, divorced, at, least, some, of, them, and, in, damascus, malabar, delhi, bukhara, and, the, maldives, had, children, by, them, or, by, concubines, ibn, battuta, insulted, greeks, as, enemies, of, allah, drunkards, and, swine, eaters, while, at, the, same, time, in, ephesus, he, purchased, and, used, a, greek, girl, who, was, one, of, his, many, slave, girls, in, his, harem, through, byzantium, khorasan, africa, and, palestine, it, was, two, decades, before, he, again, returned, to, find, out, what, happened, to, one, of, his, wives, and, child, in, damascus, ibn, battuta, often, experienced, culture, shock, in, regions, he, visited, where, the, local, customs, of, recently, converted, peoples, did, not, fit, in, with, his, orthodox, muslim, background, among, the, turks, and, mongols, he, remarked, that, on, seeing, a, turkic, couple, in, a, bazaar, one, might, assume, that, the, man, was, the, woman, s, servant, when, he, was, in, fact, her, husband, he, also, felt, that, dress, customs, in, the, maldives, and, some, sub, saharan, regions, in, africa, were, too, revealing, little, is, known, about, ibn, battuta, s, life, after, completion, of, his, rihla, in, 1355, he, was, appointed, a, judge, in, morocco, and, died, in, 1368, or, 1369, ibn, battuta, s, work, was, unknown, outside, the, muslim, world, until, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, german, traveller, explorer, ulrich, jasper, seetzen, 1767, 1811,
