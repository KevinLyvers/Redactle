over, the, world, until, his, retirement, at, the, end, of, 1992, the, precisely, articulated, accuracy, of, his, performances, in, which, text, and, music, were, presented, as, equal, partners, established, standards, that, endure, today, the, current, widespread, interest, in, german, romantic, art, song, is, mainly, due, to, his, efforts, perhaps, most, admired, as, a, singer, of, schubert, lieder, fischer, dieskau, had, according, to, critic, joachim, kaiser, only, one, really, serious, competitor, himself, as, over, the, decades, he, set, new, standards, explored, new, territories, and, expressed, unanticipated, feelings, and, emotions, few, artists, achieve, the, level, of, recognition, admiration, and, influence, of, fischer, dieskau, and, even, fewer, live, to, see, that, influence, realised, during, their, own, lifetime, ushering, in, the, modern, recording, era, he, challenged, our, perception, and, processes, of, how, recordings, could, be, made, explored, the, possibilities, of, modern, recording, and, exploited, the, potential, for, the, popularity, of, classical, music, and, all, this, while, setting, standards, of, artistic, achievement, integrity, risk, taking, and, of, the, aesthetic, ideal, that, became, our, new, norm, whenever, we, bask, in, the, beauty, of, his, tone, revere, the, probing, questioning, power, of, his, intellect, or, simply, wonder, at, the, astonishing, physical, abilities, throughout, all, that, he, has, achieved, in, his, long, recording, career, we, must, also, pause, and, say, thank, you, to, this, great, artist, whose, legacy, like, a, great, and, bright, star, lighting, the, way, for, those, who, follow, in, his, passion, for, singing, is, exemplary, in, every, way, thomas, hampson, may, 2012, hall, of, fame, gramophone, magazine, after, fischer, dieskau, s, death, le, monde, france, s, most, internationally, known, newspaper, wrote, that, fischer, dieskau, s, vocal, artistry, bordered, on, a, miracle, cela, tenait, du, miracle, as, soon, as, he, opened, his, mouth, they, believed, every, word, he, sang, not, a, single, word, not, an, intention, not, a, nuance, did, he, pass, over, in, his, diction, d, s, qu, il, ouvrait, la, bouche, on, y, croyait, pas, un, mot, pas, une, intention, pas, une, nuance, n, chappait, sa, diction, in, an, obituary, in, the, guardian, pianist, and, conductor, daniel, barenboim, fischer, dieskau, s, longtime, accompanist, in, lieder, called, the, baritone, a, revolutionary, performer, because, he, was, the, first, singer, ever, to, succeed, as, a, single, person, in, delivering, equally, extraordinary, performances, in, all, three, genres, opera, oratorio, and, lieder, in, his, interpretations, he, created, a, unity, between, text, and, music, unlike, few, before, or, after, him, he, set, the, benchmark, in, enunciation, and, he, emphasised, key, words, through, changing, the, sound, of, the, note, on, which, the, word, was, sung, thus, he, not, only, clarified, the, sense, of, the, word, but, he, let, every, syllable, and, every, note, sound, together, and, thereby, created, a, unity, of, harmony, and, colours, unlike, anyone, else, he, created, a, new, dimension, of, the, comprehensibility, and, understandability, of, the, text, in, 1949, fischer, dieskau, married, the, cellist, irmgard, poppen, together, they, had, three, sons, mathias, a, stage, designer, martin, a, conductor, and, manuel, a, cellist, with, the, cherubini, quartet, irmgard, died, in, 1963, of, complications, following, childbirth, afterwards, fischer,
