ignaz, philipp, semmelweis, german, hungarian, semmelweis, ign, c, f, l, p, 1, july, 1818, 13, august, 1865, was, a, hungarian, physician, and, scientist, of, german, descent, who, was, an, early, pioneer, of, antiseptic, procedures, and, was, described, as, the, saviour, of, mothers, postpartum, infection, also, known, as, puerperal, fever, or, childbed, fever, consists, of, any, bacterial, infection, of, the, reproductive, tract, following, birth, and, in, the, 19th, century, was, common, and, often, fatal, semmelweis, discovered, that, the, incidence, of, infection, could, be, drastically, reduced, by, requiring, healthcare, workers, in, obstetrical, clinics, to, disinfect, their, hands, in, 1847, he, proposed, hand, washing, with, chlorinated, lime, solutions, at, vienna, general, hospital, s, first, obstetrical, clinic, where, doctors, wards, had, three, times, the, mortality, of, midwives, wards, the, maternal, mortality, rate, dropped, from, 18, to, less, than, 2, and, he, published, a, book, of, his, findings, etiology, concept, and, prophylaxis, of, childbed, fever, in, 1861, despite, his, research, semmelweis, s, observations, conflicted, with, the, established, scientific, and, medical, opinions, of, the, time, and, his, ideas, were, rejected, by, the, medical, community, he, could, offer, no, theoretical, explanation, for, his, findings, of, reduced, mortality, due, to, hand, washing, and, some, doctors, were, offended, at, the, suggestion, that, they, should, wash, their, hands, and, mocked, him, for, it, in, 1865, the, increasingly, outspoken, semmelweis, allegedly, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, and, was, committed, to, an, asylum, by, his, colleagues, in, the, asylum, he, was, beaten, by, the, guards, he, died, 14, days, later, from, a, gangrenous, wound, on, his, right, hand, that, may, have, been, caused, by, the, beating, his, findings, earned, widespread, acceptance, only, years, after, his, death, when, louis, pasteur, confirmed, the, germ, theory, giving, semmelweis, observations, a, theoretical, explanation, and, joseph, lister, acting, on, pasteur, s, research, practised, and, operated, using, hygienic, methods, with, great, success, ignaz, semmelweis, was, born, on, 1, july, 1818, in, the, tab, n, neighbourhood, of, buda, kingdom, of, hungary, austrian, empire, he, was, the, fifth, child, out, of, 10, of, the, prosperous, grocer, family, of, j, zsef, semmelweis, and, ter, z, m, ller, of, german, ancestry, his, father, was, an, ethnic, german, born, in, kismarton, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, now, eisenstadt, austria, and, his, mother, an, ethnic, german, from, buda, he, was, granted, citizenship, in, buda, in, 1806, and, in, the, same, year, he, opened, a, wholesale, business, for, spices, and, general, consumer, goods, the, company, was, named, zum, wei, en, elefanten, at, the, white, elephant, in, the, meindl, house, today, s, semmelweis, museum, of, medical, history, located, at, 1, 3, apr, d, street, budapest, by, 1810, he, was, a, wealthy, man, and, married, ter, z, m, ller, daughter, of, the, coachbuilder, f, l, p, m, ller, ignaz, began, studying, law, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, the, autumn, of, 1837, but, switched, to, medicine, he, was, awarded, his, doctor, of, medicine, degree, in, 1844, after, failing, to, obtain, an, appointment, in, a, clinic, for, internal, medicine, semmelweis, specialized, in, obstetrics, his, teachers, included, carl, von, rokitansky, joseph, koda, and, ferdinand, von, hebra, semmelweis, was, appointed, assistant, to, professor, johann, klein, in, the, first, obstetrical, clinic, of, the, vienna, general, hospital, on, 1, july, 1846, two, maternity, clinics, were, at, the, viennese, hospital, the, first, clinic, had, an, average, maternal, mortality, rate, of, about, 10, due, to, puerperal, fever, the, second, clinic, s, rate, averaged, less, than, 4, women, begged, to, be, admitted, to, the, second, clinic, due, to, the, reputation, of, the, first, clinic, semmelweis, described, desperate, women, begging, on, their, knees, not, to, be, admitted, to, the, first, clinic, women, began, purposefully, giving, birth, in, the, streets, pretending, to, have, given, birth, en, route, to, the, hospital, so, they, could, avoid, being, admitted, to, the, clinic, where, the, risk, of, infection, birth, complications, and, death, were, substantially, higher, semmelweis, was, puzzled, that, puerperal, fever, was, rare, among, women, giving, street, births, prompting, his, curiosity, as, to, what, protected, those, who, delivered, outside, the, clinic, troubled, by, the, mortality, discrepancy, between, the, two, clinics, semmelweis, searched, for, differences, he, excluded, overcrowding, as, a, cause, since, the, second, clinic, was, always, more, crowded, he, eliminated, climate, because, the, two, clinics, were, in, close, geographical, proximity, to, each, other, he, altered, the, position, in, which, mothers, gave, birth, and, proposed, that, priests, giving, last, rites, in, the, clinic, was, terrifying, women, after, birth, causing, them, to, develop, the, fever, semmelweis, breakthrough, occurred, in, 1847, following, the, death, of, his, good, friend, jakob, kolletschka, who, had, been, accidentally, poked, with, a, student, s, scalpel, while, performing, a, post, mortem, examination, kolletschka, s, autopsy, showed, a, pathology, similar, to, that, of, the, women, who, were, dying, from, puerperal, fever, semmelweis, immediately, proposed, a, connection, between, cadaveric, contamination, and, puerperal, fever, he, proposed, that, he, and, the, medical, students, carried, cadaverous, particles, on, their, hands, from, the, autopsy, room, to, the, patients, they, examined, in, the, first, obstetrical, clinic, this, explained, why, the, student, midwives, in, the, second, clinic, who, were, not, engaged, in, autopsies, and, had, no, contact, with, corpses, saw, a, much, lower, mortality, rate, the, germ, theory, of, disease, had, not, yet, been, accepted, in, vienna, thus, semmelweis, concluded, some, unknown, cadaverous, material, caused, childbed, fever, he, instituted, a, policy, of, using, a, solution, of, chlorinated, lime, calcium, hypochlorite, for, washing, hands, between, autopsy, work, and, the, examination, of, patients, he, did, this, because, he, found, that, this, chlorinated, solution, worked, best, to, remove, the, putrid, smell, of, infected, autopsy, tissue, and, thus, perhaps, destroyed, the, causal, poisonous, or, contaminating, cadaveric, agent, hypothetically, being, transmitted, by, this, material, the, result, was, the, mortality, rate, in, the, first, clinic, declined, 90, and, was, then, comparable, to, that, in, the, second, clinic, the, mortality, rate, in, april, 1847, before, the, new, hand, washing, procedures, were, instituted, was, 18, 3, the, new, procedures, started, in, mid, may, leading, to, lower, rates, june, 2, 2, july, 1, 2, and, august, 1, 9, in, two, months, in, the, year, following, this, discovery, for, the, first, time, since, the, introduction, of, anatomical, orientation, the, death, rate, was, zero, semmelweis, s, hypothesis, that, there, was, only, one, cause, that, all, that, mattered, was, cleanliness, was, extreme, at, the, time, and, was, largely, ignored, rejected, or, ridiculed, he, was, dismissed, from, the, hospital, for, political, reasons, and, harassed, by, the, medical, community, in, vienna, being, eventually, forced, to, move, to, budapest, semmelweis, was, outraged, by, the, indifference, of, the, medical, profession, and, began, writing, open, and, increasingly, angry, letters, to, prominent, european, obstetricians, at, times, denouncing, them, as, irresponsible, murderers, his, contemporaries, including, his, wife, believed, he, was, losing, his, mind, and, in, 1865, nearly, 20, years, after, his, breakthrough, he, was, committed, to, the, landesirrenanstalt, d, bling, provincial, lunatic, asylum, he, died, there, of, septic, shock, only, 14, days, later, possibly, as, the, result, of, being, severely, beaten, by, guards, semmelweis, s, practice, earned, widespread, acceptance, only, years, after, his, death, when, louis, pasteur, further, developed, the, germ, theory, of, disease, offering, a, theoretical, explanation, for, semmelweis, s, findings, he, is, considered, a, pioneer, of, antiseptic, procedures, semmelweis, s, observations, conflicted, with, the, established, scientific, and, medical, opinions, of, the, time, the, theory, of, diseases, was, highly, influenced, by, ideas, of, an, imbalance, of, the, basic, four, humours, in, the, body, a, theory, known, as, dyscrasia, for, which, the, main, treatment, was, bloodlettings, medical, texts, at, the, time, emphasized, that, each, case, of, disease, was, unique, the, result, of, a, personal, imbalance, and, the, main, difficulty, of, the, medical, profession, was, to, establish, precisely, each, patient, s, unique, situation, case, by, case, the, findings, from, autopsies, of, deceased, women, also, showed, a, confusing, multitude, of, physical, signs, which, emphasized, the, belief, that, puerperal, fever, was, not, one, but, many, different, yet, unidentified, diseases, the, rejection, of, semmelweis, s, empirical, observations, is, often, traced, to, belief, perseverance, the, psychological, tendency, of, clinging, to, discredited, beliefs, also, some, historians, of, science, argue, that, resistance, to, path, breaking, contributions, of, obscure, scientists, is, common, and, constitutes, the, single, most, formidable, block, to, scientific, advances, as, a, result, his, ideas, were, rejected, by, the, medical, community, other, more, subtle, factors, may, also, have, played, a, role, some, doctors, for, instance, were, offended, at, the, suggestion, that, they, should, wash, their, hands, feeling, that, their, social, status, as, gentlemen, was, inconsistent, with, the, idea, that, their, hands, could, be, unclean, semmelweis, s, results, lacked, scientific, explanation, at, the, time, that, became, possible, only, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, when, louis, pasteur, joseph, lister, and, others, further, developed, the, germ, theory, of, disease, during, 1848, semmelweis, widened, the, scope, of, his, washing, protocol, to, include, all, instruments, coming, in, contact, with, patients, in, labour, and, used, mortality, rates, time, series, to, document, his, success, in, virtually, eliminating, puerperal, fever, from, the, hospital, ward, toward, the, end, of, 1847, accounts, of, the, work, of, semmelweis, as, well, as, the, similar, conclusions, of, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, working, in, the, united, states, of, america, began, to, spread, around, europe, semmelweis, and, his, students, wrote, letters, to, the, directors, of, several, prominent, maternity, clinics, describing, their, recent, observations, ferdinand, von, hebra, the, editor, of, a, leading, austrian, medical, journal, announced, semmelweis, s, discovery, in, the, december, 1847, and, april, 1848, issues, of, the, medical, journal, hebra, claimed, that, semmelweis, s, work, had, a, practical, significance, comparable, to, that, of, edward, jenner, s, introduction, of, cowpox, inoculations, to, prevent, smallpox, in, late, 1848, one, of, semmelweis, s, former, students, wrote, a, lecture, explaining, semmelweis, s, work, the, lecture, was, presented, before, the, royal, medical, and, surgical, society, in, london, and, a, review, published, in, the, lancet, a, prominent, medical, journal, a, few, months, later, another, of, semmelweis, s, former, students, published, a, similar, essay, in, a, french, periodical, as, accounts, of, the, dramatic, reduction, in, mortality, rates, in, vienna, were, being, circulated, throughout, europe, semmelweis, had, reason, to, expect, that, the, chlorine, washings, would, be, widely, adopted, saving, tens, of, thousands, of, lives, early, responses, to, his, work, also, gave, clear, signs, of, coming, trouble, however, some, physicians, had, clearly, misinterpreted, his, claims, additionally, initial, responses, to, semmelweis, s, findings, tended, to, downplay, their, significance, by, arguing, that, he, had, said, nothing, new, james, young, simpson, for, instance, saw, no, difference, between, semmelweis, s, groundbreaking, findings, and, the, idea, presented, in, an, 1843, paper, by, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, that, childbed, fever, was, contagious, i, e, that, infected, persons, could, pass, the, infection, to, others, in, fact, semmelweis, was, warning, against, all, decaying, organic, matter, not, just, against, a, specific, contagion, that, originated, from, victims, of, childbed, fever, themselves, this, misunderstanding, and, others, like, it, occurred, partly, because, semmelweis, s, work, was, known, only, through, secondhand, reports, written, by, his, colleagues, and, students, at, this, crucial, stage, semmelweis, himself, had, published, nothing, these, and, similar, misinterpretations, continued, to, cloud, discussions, of, his, work, throughout, the, century, some, accounts, emphasize, that, semmelweis, refused, to, communicate, his, method, officially, to, the, learned, circles, of, vienna, nor, was, he, eager, to, explain, it, on, paper, in, 1848, a, series, of, tumultuous, revolutions, swept, across, europe, the, resulting, political, turmoil, would, affect, semmelweis, s, career, in, vienna, on, 13, march, 1848, students, demonstrated, in, favor, of, increased, civil, rights, including, trial, by, jury, and, freedom, of, expression, the, demonstrations, were, led, by, medical, students, and, young, faculty, members, and, were, joined, by, workers, from, the, suburbs, two, days, later, in, hungary, demonstrations, and, uprisings, led, to, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, and, a, full, scale, war, against, the, ruling, habsburgs, of, the, austrian, empire, in, vienna, the, march, demonstration, was, followed, by, months, of, general, unrest, no, evidence, indicates, semmelweis, was, personally, involved, in, the, events, of, 1848, some, of, his, brothers, were, punished, for, active, participation, in, the, hungarian, independence, movement, and, the, hungarian, born, semmelweis, likely, was, sympathetic, to, the, cause, semmelweis, s, superior, professor, johann, klein, was, a, conservative, austrian, likely, uneasy, with, the, independence, movements, and, alarmed, by, the, other, revolutions, of, 1848, in, the, habsburg, areas, klein, probably, mistrusted, semmelweis, when, semmelweis, s, term, was, about, to, expire, carl, braun, also, applied, for, the, position, of, assistant, in, the, first, clinic, possibly, at, klein, s, own, invitation, semmelweis, and, braun, were, the, only, two, applicants, for, the, post, semmelweis, s, predecessor, franz, breit, had, been, granted, a, two, year, extension, semmelweis, s, application, for, an, extension, was, supported, by, joseph, koda, and, carl, von, rokitansky, and, by, most, of, the, medical, faculty, but, klein, chose, braun, for, the, position, semmelweis, was, obliged, to, leave, the, obstetrical, clinic, when, his, term, expired, on, 20, march, 1849, the, day, his, term, expired, semmelweis, petitioned, the, viennese, authorities, to, be, made, docent, of, obstetrics, a, docent, was, a, private, lecturer, who, taught, students, and, who, had, access, to, some, university, facilities, at, first, because, of, klein, s, opposition, semmelweis, s, petition, was, denied, he, reapplied, but, had, to, wait, until, 10, october, 1850, more, than, 18, months, before, finally, being, appointed, docent, of, theoretical, obstetrics, the, terms, refused, him, access, to, cadavers, and, limited, him, to, teaching, students, by, using, leather, fabricated, mannequins, only, a, few, days, after, being, notified, of, his, appointment, semmelweis, left, vienna, abruptly, and, returned, to, pest, he, apparently, left, without, so, much, as, saying, goodbye, to, his, former, friends, and, colleagues, a, move, that, might, have, offended, them, according, to, his, own, account, he, left, vienna, because, he, was, unable, to, endure, further, frustrations, in, dealing, with, the, viennese, medical, establishment, during, 1848, 1849, some, 70, 000, troops, from, the, habsburg, ruled, austrian, empire, thwarted, the, hungarian, independence, movement, executed, or, imprisoned, its, leaders, and, in, the, process, destroyed, parts, of, pest, semmelweis, upon, arriving, from, the, habsburg, vienna, in, 1850, likely, was, not, warmly, welcomed, in, pest, on, 20, may, 1851, semmelweis, took, the, relatively, insignificant, unpaid, honorary, head, physician, position, of, the, obstetric, ward, of, pest, s, small, szent, r, kus, hospital, he, held, that, position, for, six, years, until, june, 1857, childbed, fever, was, rampant, at, the, clinic, at, a, visit, in, 1850, just, after, returning, to, pest, semmelweis, found, one, fresh, corpse, another, patient, in, severe, agony, and, four, others, seriously, ill, with, the, disease, after, taking, over, in, 1851, semmelweis, virtually, eliminated, the, disease, during, 1851, 1855, only, eight, patients, died, from, childbed, fever, out, of, 933, births, 0, 85, despite, the, impressive, results, semmelweis, s, ideas, were, not, accepted, by, the, other, obstetricians, in, budapest, the, professor, of, obstetrics, at, the, university, of, pest, ede, fl, ri, n, birly, never, adopted, semmelweis, s, methods, he, continued, to, believe, that, puerperal, fever, was, due, to, uncleanliness, of, the, bowel, therefore, extensive, purging, was, the, preferred, treatment, after, birly, died, in, 1854, semmelweis, applied, for, the, position, so, did, carl, braun, semmelweis, s, nemesis, and, successor, as, johann, klein, s, assistant, in, vienna, and, braun, received, more, votes, from, his, hungarian, colleagues, than, semmelweis, did, semmelweis, was, eventually, appointed, in, 1855, but, only, because, the, viennese, authorities, overruled, the, wishes, of, the, hungarians, as, braun, did, not, speak, hungarian, as, professor, of, obstetrics, semmelweis, instituted, chlorine, washings, at, the, university, of, pest, maternity, clinic, once, again, the, results, were, impressive, semmelweis, declined, an, offer, in, 1857, to, become, professor, of, obstetrics, at, the, university, of, zurich, the, same, year, semmelweis, married, m, ria, weidenhofer, 1837, 1910, 19, years, his, junior, and, the, daughter, of, a, successful, merchant, in, pest, they, had, five, children, semmelweis, s, views, were, much, more, favorably, received, in, the, united, kingdom, than, on, the, continent, but, he, was, more, often, cited, than, understood, the, british, consistently, regarded, semmelweis, as, having, supported, their, theory, of, contagion, a, typical, example, was, w, tyler, smith, who, claimed, that, semmelweis, made, out, very, conclusively, that, miasms, derived, from, the, dissecting, room, will, excite, puerperal, disease, one, of, the, first, to, respond, to, semmelweis, s, 1848, communications, was, james, young, simpson, who, wrote, a, stinging, letter, simpson, surmised, that, the, british, obstetrical, literature, must, be, totally, unknown, in, vienna, or, semmelweis, would, have, known, that, the, british, had, long, regarded, childbed, fever, as, contagious, and, would, have, employed, chlorine, washing, to, protect, against, it, in, 1856, semmelweis, s, assistant, josef, fleischer, reported, the, successful, results, of, hand, washing, activities, at, st, rochus, and, pest, maternity, institutions, in, the, viennese, medical, weekly, wiener, medizinische, wochenschrift, the, editor, remarked, sarcastically, that, it, was, time, people, stopped, being, misled, about, the, theory, of, chlorine, washings, two, years, later, semmelweis, published, his, own, account, of, his, work, in, an, essay, entitled, the, etiology, of, childbed, fever, two, years, after, that, he, published, a, second, essay, the, difference, in, opinion, between, myself, and, the, english, physicians, regarding, childbed, fever, in, 1861, semmelweis, published, his, main, work, die, tiologie, der, begriff, und, die, prophylaxis, des, kindbettfiebers, german, for, the, etiology, concept, and, prophylaxis, of, childbed, fever, in, his, 1861, book, semmelweis, lamented, the, slow, adoption, of, his, ideas, most, medical, lecture, halls, continue, to, resound, with, lectures, on, epidemic, childbed, fever, and, with, discourses, against, my, theories, in, published, medical, works, my, teachings, are, either, ignored, or, attacked, the, medical, faculty, at, w, rzburg, awarded, a, prize, to, a, monograph, written, in, 1859, in, which, my, teachings, were, rejected, in, a, textbook, carl, braun, semmelweis, s, successor, as, assistant, in, the, first, clinic, identified, 30, causes, of, childbed, fever, only, the, 28th, of, these, was, cadaverous, infection, other, supposed, causes, included, conception, and, pregnancy, uremia, pressure, exerted, on, adjacent, organs, by, the, shrinking, uterus, emotional, traumata, mistakes, in, diet, chilling, and, atmospheric, epidemic, influences, despite, this, opposition, braun, who, was, assistant, in, the, first, division, in, the, period, april, 1849, to, summer, 1853, maintained, a, relatively, low, mortality, rate, in, the, first, division, roughly, consistent, with, the, rate, semmelweis, himself, achieved, as, mortality, rates, in, the, period, april, 1849, to, end, 1853, show, these, results, suggest, that, braun, continued, assiduously, to, require, the, chlorine, washings, at, a, conference, of, german, physicians, and, natural, scientists, most, of, the, speakers, rejected, his, doctrine, including, the, celebrated, rudolf, virchow, who, was, a, scientist, of, the, highest, authority, of, his, time, virchow, s, great, authority, in, medical, circles, contributed, potently, to, semmelweis, lack, of, recognition, ede, fl, ri, n, birly, semmelweis, s, predecessor, as, professor, of, obstetrics, at, the, university, of, pest, never, accepted, semmelweis, s, teachings, he, continued, to, believe, that, puerperal, fever, was, due, to, uncleanliness, of, the, bowel, august, breisky, an, obstetrician, in, prague, rejected, semmelweis, s, book, as, na, ve, and, he, referred, to, it, as, the, koran, of, puerperal, theology, breisky, objected, that, semmelweis, had, not, proved, that, puerperal, fever, and, pyemia, are, identical, and, he, insisted, that, other, factors, beyond, decaying, organic, matter, certainly, had, to, be, included, in, the, etiology, of, the, disease, carl, edvard, marius, levy, head, of, the, copenhagen, maternity, hospital, and, an, outspoken, critic, of, semmelweis, s, ideas, had, reservations, concerning, the, unspecific, nature, of, cadaverous, particles, and, that, the, supposed, quantities, were, unreasonably, small, in, fact, robert, koch, later, used, precisely, this, fact, to, prove, that, various, infecting, materials, contained, living, organisms, which, could, reproduce, in, the, human, body, that, is, since, the, poison, could, be, neither, chemical, nor, physical, in, operation, it, must, be, biological, it, has, been, contended, that, semmelweis, could, have, had, an, even, greater, impact, if, he, had, managed, to, communicate, his, findings, more, effectively, and, avoid, antagonising, the, medical, establishment, even, given, the, opposition, from, entrenched, viewpoints, after, a, number, of, unfavorable, foreign, reviews, of, his, 1861, book, semmelweis, lashed, out, against, his, critics, in, a, series, of, open, letters, they, were, addressed, to, various, prominent, european, obstetricians, including, sp, th, scanzoni, siebold, and, to, all, obstetricians, they, were, full, of, bitterness, desperation, and, fury, and, were, highly, polemical, and, superlatively, offensive, at, times, denouncing, his, critics, as, irresponsible, murderers, or, ignoramuses, he, also, called, upon, siebold, to, arrange, a, meeting, of, german, obstetricians, somewhere, in, germany, to, provide, a, forum, for, discussions, on, puerperal, fever, where, he, would, stay, until, all, have, been, converted, to, his, theory, in, mid, 1865, his, public, behaviour, became, exasperating, and, embarrassing, to, his, associates, he, also, began, to, drink, immoderately, he, spent, progressively, more, time, away, from, his, family, sometimes, in, the, company, of, a, prostitute, and, his, wife, noticed, changes, in, his, sexual, behavior, on, 13, july, 1865, the, semmelweis, family, visited, friends, and, during, the, visit, semmelweis, s, behavior, seemed, particularly, inappropriate, semmelweis, s, alleged, affliction, has, been, a, subject, of, some, debate, according, to, k, codell, carter, in, his, biography, of, semmelweis, its, exact, nature, cannot, be, determined, it, is, impossible, to, appraise, the, nature, of, semmelweis, s, disorder, it, might, have, been, alzheimer, s, disease, a, type, of, dementia, which, is, associated, with, rapid, cognitive, decline, and, mood, changes, it, might, have, been, third, stage, syphilis, a, then, common, disease, of, obstetricians, who, examined, thousands, of, women, at, gratis, institutions, or, it, might, have, been, emotional, exhaustion, from, overwork, and,

deductive, nomological, model, it, has, been, seen, as, an, irony, that, semmelweis, critics, considered, themselves, positivists, but, even, positivism, suffers, problems, in, the, face, of, theories, which, seem, magical, or, superstitious, such, as, the, idea, that, corpse, particles, might, turn, a, person, into, a, corpse, with, no, causal, mechanism, being, stipulated, after, a,
