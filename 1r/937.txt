origen, of, alexandria, c, 185, c, 253, also, known, as, origen, adamantius, was, an, early, christian, scholar, ascetic, and, theologian, who, was, born, and, spent, the, first, half, of, his, career, in, alexandria, he, was, a, prolific, writer, who, wrote, roughly, 2, 000, treatises, in, multiple, branches, of, theology, including, textual, criticism, biblical, exegesis, and, hermeneutics, homiletics, and, spirituality, he, was, one, of, the, most, influential, and, controversial, figures, in, early, christian, theology, apologetics, and, asceticism, he, has, been, described, as, the, greatest, genius, the, early, church, ever, produced, origen, sought, martyrdom, with, his, father, at, a, young, age, but, was, prevented, from, turning, himself, in, to, the, authorities, by, his, mother, when, he, was, eighteen, years, old, origen, became, a, catechist, at, the, didascalium, or, school, of, alexandria, he, devoted, himself, to, his, studies, and, adopted, an, ascetic, lifestyle, he, came, into, conflict, with, demetrius, bishop, of, alexandria, in, 231, after, he, was, ordained, as, a, presbyter, by, his, friend, theoclistus, the, bishop, of, caesarea, while, on, a, journey, to, athens, through, palestine, demetrius, condemned, origen, for, insubordination, and, accused, him, of, having, castrated, himself, and, of, having, taught, that, even, satan, would, eventually, attain, salvation, an, accusation, which, origen, vehemently, denied, origen, founded, the, christian, school, of, caesarea, where, he, taught, logic, cosmology, natural, history, and, theology, and, became, regarded, by, the, churches, of, palestine, and, arabia, as, the, ultimate, authority, on, all, matters, of, theology, he, was, tortured, for, his, faith, during, the, decian, persecution, in, 250, and, died, three, to, four, years, later, from, his, injuries, origen, produced, a, massive, quantity, of, writings, because, of, the, patronage, of, his, close, friend, ambrose, of, alexandria, who, provided, him, with, a, team, of, secretaries, to, copy, his, works, making, him, one, of, the, most, prolific, writers, in, late, antiquity, his, treatise, on, the, first, principles, systematically, laid, out, the, principles, of, christian, theology, and, became, the, foundation, for, later, theological, writings, he, also, authored, contra, celsum, the, most, influential, work, of, early, christian, apologetics, in, which, he, defended, christianity, against, the, pagan, philosopher, celsus, one, of, its, foremost, early, critics, origen, produced, the, hexapla, the, first, critical, edition, of, the, hebrew, bible, which, contained, the, original, hebrew, text, four, different, greek, translations, and, a, greek, transliteration, of, the, hebrew, all, written, in, columns, side, by, side, he, wrote, hundreds, of, sermons, covering, almost, the, entire, bible, interpreting, many, passages, as, allegorical, origen, taught, that, before, the, creation, of, the, material, universe, god, had, created, the, souls, of, all, intelligent, beings, these, souls, at, first, fully, devoted, to, god, fell, away, from, him, and, were, given, physical, bodies, origen, was, the, first, to, propose, the, ransom, theory, of, atonement, in, its, fully, developed, form, and, he, also, significantly, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, concept, of, the, trinity, origen, hoped, that, all, people, might, eventually, attain, salvation, but, was, always, careful, to, maintain, that, this, was, only, speculation, he, defended, free, will, and, advocated, christian, pacifism, origen, is, considered, by, some, christian, groups, to, be, a, church, father, he, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, christian, theologians, his, teachings, were, especially, influential, in, the, east, with, athanasius, of, alexandria, and, the, three, cappadocian, fathers, being, among, his, most, devoted, followers, argument, over, the, orthodoxy, of, origen, s, teachings, spawned, the, first, origenist, crisis, in, the, late, fourth, century, in, which, he, was, attacked, by, epiphanius, of, salamis, and, jerome, but, defended, by, tyrannius, rufinus, and, john, of, jerusalem, in, 543, emperor, justinian, i, condemned, him, as, a, heretic, and, ordered, all, his, writings, to, be, burned, the, second, council, of, constantinople, in, 553, may, have, anathematized, origen, or, it, may, have, only, condemned, certain, heretical, teachings, which, claimed, to, be, derived, from, origen, the, church, rejected, his, teachings, on, the, pre, existence, of, souls, almost, all, information, about, origen, s, life, comes, from, a, lengthy, biography, of, him, in, book, vi, of, the, ecclesiastical, history, written, by, the, christian, historian, eusebius, c, 260, c, 340, eusebius, portrays, origen, as, the, perfect, christian, scholar, and, a, literal, saint, eusebius, however, wrote, this, account, almost, fifty, years, after, origen, s, death, and, had, access, to, few, reliable, sources, on, origen, s, life, especially, his, early, years, anxious, for, more, material, about, his, hero, eusebius, recorded, events, based, only, on, unreliable, hearsay, evidence, he, frequently, made, speculative, inferences, about, origen, based, on, the, sources, he, had, available, nonetheless, scholars, can, reconstruct, a, general, impression, of, origen, s, historical, life, by, sorting, out, the, parts, of, eusebius, s, account, that, are, accurate, from, those, that, are, inaccurate, origen, was, born, in, either, 185, or, 186, ad, in, alexandria, porphyry, called, him, a, greek, and, educated, in, greek, literature, according, to, eusebius, origen, s, father, was, leonides, of, alexandria, a, respected, professor, of, literature, and, also, a, devout, christian, who, practised, his, religion, openly, and, later, a, martyr, and, saint, with, a, feast, day, of, april, 22, in, the, catholic, church, joseph, wilson, trigg, deems, the, details, of, this, report, unreliable, but, admits, that, origen, s, father, was, certainly, at, least, a, prosperous, and, thoroughly, hellenized, bourgeois, according, to, john, anthony, mcguckin, origen, s, mother, whose, name, is, unknown, may, have, been, a, member, of, the, lower, class, who, did, not, have, the, right, of, citizenship, it, is, likely, that, on, account, of, his, mother, s, status, origen, was, not, a, roman, citizen, origen, s, father, taught, him, about, literature, and, philosophy, as, well, as, the, bible, and, christian, doctrine, eusebius, states, that, origen, s, father, made, him, memorize, passages, of, scripture, daily, trigg, accepts, this, tradition, as, possibly, genuine, given, origen, s, ability, as, an, adult, to, recite, extended, passages, of, scripture, at, will, eusebius, also, reports, that, origen, became, so, learned, about, the, holy, scriptures, at, an, early, age, that, his, father, was, unable, to, answer, his, questions, about, them, in, 202, when, origen, was, not, yet, seventeen, the, roman, emperor, septimius, severus, ordered, roman, citizens, who, openly, practised, christianity, to, be, executed, origen, s, father, leonides, was, arrested, and, thrown, in, prison, eusebius, reports, that, origen, wanted, to, turn, himself, in, to, the, authorities, so, that, they, would, execute, him, as, well, but, his, mother, hid, all, his, clothes, and, he, was, unable, to, go, to, the, authorities, since, he, refused, to, leave, the, house, naked, according, to, mcguckin, even, if, origen, had, turned, himself, in, it, is, unlikely, that, he, would, have, been, punished, since, the, emperor, was, only, intent, on, executing, roman, citizens, origen, s, father, was, beheaded, and, the, state, confiscated, the, family, s, entire, property, leaving, them, impoverished, origen, was, the, eldest, of, nine, children, and, as, his, father, s, heir, it, became, his, responsibility, to, provide, for, the, whole, family, when, he, was, eighteen, origen, was, appointed, as, a, catechist, at, the, catechetical, school, of, alexandria, many, scholars, have, assumed, that, origen, became, the, head, of, the, school, but, according, to, mcguckin, this, is, highly, improbable, it, is, more, likely, that, he, was, given, a, paid, teaching, position, perhaps, as, a, relief, effort, for, his, impoverished, family, while, employed, at, the, school, he, adopted, the, ascetic, lifestyle, of, the, greek, sophists, he, spent, the, whole, day, teaching, and, would, stay, up, late, at, night, writing, treatises, and, commentaries, he, went, barefoot, and, only, owned, one, cloak, he, did, not, drink, alcohol, and, ate, a, simple, diet, and, he, often, fasted, for, long, periods, although, eusebius, goes, to, great, lengths, to, portray, origen, as, one, of, the, christian, monastics, of, his, era, this, portrayal, is, now, generally, recognized, as, anachronistic, according, to, eusebius, as, a, young, man, origen, was, taken, in, by, a, wealthy, gnostic, woman, who, was, also, the, patron, of, a, very, influential, gnostic, theologian, from, antioch, who, frequently, lectured, in, her, home, eusebius, goes, to, great, lengths, to, insist, that, although, origen, studied, while, in, her, home, he, never, once, prayed, in, common, with, her, or, the, gnostic, theologian, later, origen, succeeded, in, converting, a, wealthy, man, named, ambrose, from, valentinian, gnosticism, to, orthodox, christianity, ambrose, was, so, impressed, by, the, young, scholar, that, he, gave, origen, a, house, a, secretary, seven, stenographers, a, crew, of, copyists, and, calligraphers, and, paid, for, all, of, his, writings, to, be, published, when, he, was, in, his, early, twenties, origen, sold, the, small, library, of, greek, literary, works, that, he, had, inherited, from, his, father, for, a, sum, which, netted, him, a, daily, income, of, four, obols, he, used, this, money, to, continue, his, study, of, the, bible, and, of, philosophy, origen, studied, at, numerous, schools, throughout, alexandria, including, the, platonic, academy, of, alexandria, where, he, was, a, student, of, ammonius, saccas, eusebius, claims, that, origen, studied, under, clement, of, alexandria, but, according, to, mcguckin, this, is, almost, certainly, a, retrospective, assumption, based, on, the, similarity, of, their, teachings, origen, rarely, mentions, clement, in, his, writings, and, when, he, does, it, is, usually, to, correct, him, eusebius, claims, that, as, a, young, man, following, a, literal, reading, of, matthew, 19, 12, in, which, jesus, is, presented, as, saying, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, made, themselves, eunuch, for, the, sake, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, origen, either, castrated, himself, or, had, someone, else, castrate, him, in, order, to, ensure, his, reputation, as, a, respectable, tutor, to, young, men, and, women, eusebius, further, alleges, that, origen, privately, told, demetrius, the, bishop, of, alexandria, about, the, castration, and, that, demetrius, initially, praised, him, for, his, devotion, to, god, on, account, of, it, origen, however, never, mentions, anything, about, having, castrated, himself, in, any, of, his, surviving, writings, and, in, his, explanation, of, this, verse, in, his, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, written, near, the, end, of, life, he, strongly, condemns, any, literal, interpretation, of, matthew, 19, 12, asserting, that, only, an, idiot, would, interpret, the, passage, as, advocating, literal, castration, since, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, some, scholars, have, questioned, the, historicity, of, origen, s, self, castration, with, many, seeing, it, as, a, wholesale, fabrication, trigg, states, that, eusebius, s, account, of, origen, s, self, castration, is, certainly, true, because, eusebius, who, was, an, ardent, admirer, of, origen, yet, clearly, describes, the, castration, as, an, act, of, pure, folly, would, have, had, no, motive, to, pass, on, a, piece, of, information, that, might, tarnish, origen, s, reputation, unless, it, was, notorious, and, beyond, question, trigg, sees, origen, s, condemnation, of, the, literal, interpretation, of, matthew, 19, 12, as, him, tacitly, repudiating, the, literalistic, reading, he, had, acted, on, in, his, youth, in, sharp, contrast, mcguckin, dismisses, eusebius, s, story, of, origen, s, self, castration, as, hardly, credible, seeing, it, as, a, deliberate, attempt, by, eusebius, to, distract, from, more, serious, questions, regarding, the, orthodoxy, of, origen, s, teachings, mcguckin, also, states, we, have, no, indication, that, the, motive, of, castration, for, respectability, was, ever, regarded, as, standard, by, a, teacher, of, mixed, gender, classes, he, adds, that, origen, s, female, students, whom, eusebius, lists, by, name, would, have, been, accompanied, by, attendants, at, all, times, meaning, that, origen, would, have, had, no, good, reason, to, think, that, anyone, would, suspect, him, of, impropriety, henry, chadwick, argues, that, while, eusebius, s, story, may, be, true, it, seems, unlikely, given, that, origen, s, exposition, of, matthew, 19, 12, strongly, deplored, any, literal, interpretation, of, the, words, instead, chadwick, suggests, perhaps, eusebius, was, uncritically, reporting, malicious, gossip, retailed, by, origen, s, enemies, of, whom, there, were, many, however, many, noted, historians, such, as, peter, brown, and, william, placher, continue, to, find, no, reason, to, conclude, that, the, story, is, false, placher, theorizes, that, if, it, is, true, it, may, have, followed, an, episode, in, which, origen, received, some, raised, eyebrows, while, privately, tutoring, a, woman, in, his, early, twenties, origen, became, less, interested, in, work, as, a, grammarian, and, more, interested, in, operating, as, a, rhetor, philosopher, he, gave, his, job, as, a, catechist, to, his, younger, colleague, heraclas, meanwhile, origen, began, to, style, himself, as, a, master, of, philosophy, origen, s, new, position, as, a, self, styled, christian, philosopher, brought, him, into, conflict, with, demetrius, the, bishop, of, alexandria, demetrius, a, charismatic, leader, who, ruled, the, christian, congregation, of, alexandria, with, an, iron, fist, became, the, most, direct, promoter, of, the, elevation, in, status, of, the, bishop, of, alexandria, before, demetrius, the, bishop, of, alexandria, had, merely, been, a, priest, who, was, elected, to, represent, his, fellows, but, after, demetrius, the, bishop, was, seen, as, clearly, a, rank, higher, than, his, fellow, priests, by, styling, himself, as, an, independent, philosopher, origen, was, reviving, a, role, that, had, been, prominent, in, earlier, christianity, but, which, challenged, the, authority, of, the, now, powerful, bishop, meanwhile, origen, began, composing, his, massive, theological, treatise, on, the, first, principles, a, landmark, book, which, systematically, laid, out, the, foundations, of, christian, theology, for, centuries, to, come, origen, also, began, travelling, abroad, to, visit, schools, across, the, mediterranean, in, 212, he, travelled, to, rome, a, major, center, of, philosophy, at, the, time, in, rome, origen, attended, lectures, by, hippolytus, of, rome, and, was, influenced, by, his, logos, theology, in, 213, or, 214, the, governor, of, the, province, of, arabia, sent, a, message, to, the, prefect, of, egypt, requesting, him, to, send, origen, to, meet, with, him, so, that, he, could, interview, him, and, learn, more, about, christianity, from, its, leading, intellectual, origen, escorted, by, official, bodyguards, spent, a, short, time, in, arabia, with, the, governor, before, returning, to, alexandria, in, the, autumn, of, 215, the, roman, emperor, caracalla, visited, alexandria, during, the, visit, the, students, at, the, schools, there, protested, and, made, fun, of, him, for, having, murdered, his, brother, geta, died, 211, caracalla, incensed, ordered, his, troops, to, ravage, the, city, execute, the, governor, and, kill, all, the, protesters, he, also, commanded, them, to, expel, all, the, teachers, and, intellectuals, from, the, city, origen, fled, alexandria, and, traveled, to, the, city, of, caesarea, maritima, in, the, roman, province, of, palestine, where, the, bishops, theoctistus, of, caesarea, and, alexander, of, jerusalem, became, his, devoted, admirers, and, asked, him, to, deliver, discourses, on, the, scriptures, in, their, respective, churches, this, effectively, allowed, origen, to, deliver, sermons, even, though, he, was, not, formally, ordained, while, this, was, an, unexpected, phenomenon, especially, given, origen, s, international, fame, as, a, teacher, and, philosopher, it, infuriated, demetrius, who, saw, it, as, a, direct, undermining, of, his, authority, demetrius, sent, deacons, from, alexandria, to, demand, that, the, palestinian, hierarchs, immediately, return, his, catechist, to, alexandria, he, also, issued, a, decree, chastising, the, palestinians, for, allowing, a, person, who, was, not, ordained, to, preach, the, palestinian, bishops, in, turn, issued, their, condemnation, accusing, demetrius, of, being, jealous, of, origen, s, fame, and, prestige, origen, obeyed, demetrius, s, order, and, returned, to, alexandria, bringing, with, him, an, antique, scroll, he, had, purchased, at, jericho, containing, the, full, text, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, manuscript, which, had, purportedly, been, found, in, a, jar, became, the, source, text, for, one, of, the, two, hebrew, columns, in, origen, s, hexapla, origen, studied, the, old, testament, in, great, depth, eusebius, even, claims, that, origen, learned, hebrew, most, modern, scholars, regard, this, claim, as, implausible, but, they, disagree, over, how, much, origen, knew, about, the, language, h, lietzmann, concludes, that, origen, probably, only, knew, the, hebrew, alphabet, and, not, much, else, whereas, r, p, c, hanson, and, g, bardy, argue, that, origen, had, a, superficial, understanding, of, the, language, but, not, enough, to, have, composed, the, entire, hexapla, a, note, in, origen, s, on, the, first, principles, mentions, an, unknown, hebrew, master, but, this, was, probably, a, consultant, not, a, teacher, origen, also, studied, the, entire, new, testament, but, especially, the, epistles, of, the, apostle, paul, and, the, gospel, of, john, the, writings, which, origen, regarded, as, the, most, important, and, authoritative, at, ambrose, s, request, origen, composed, the, first, five, books, of, his, exhaustive, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, john, he, also, wrote, the, first, eight, books, of, his, commentary, on, genesis, his, commentary, on, psalms, 1, 25, and, his, commentary, on, lamentations, in, addition, to, these, commentaries, origen, also, wrote, two, books, on, the, resurrection, of, jesus, and, ten, books, of, stromata, miscellanies, it, is, likely, that, these, works, contained, much, theological, speculation, which, brought, origen, into, even, greater, conflict, with, demetrius, origen, repeatedly, asked, demetrius, to, ordain, him, as, a, priest, but, demetrius, continually, refused, in, around, 231, demetrius, sent, origen, on, a, mission, to, athens, along, the, way, origen, stopped, in, caesarea, where, he, was, warmly, greeted, by, the, bishops, theoctistus, of, caesarea, and, alexander, of, jerusalem, who, had, become, his, close, friends, during, his, previous, stay, while, he, was, visiting, caesarea, origen, asked, theoctistus, to, ordain, him, as, a, priest, theoctistus, gladly, complied, upon, learning, of, origen, s, ordination, demetrius, was, outraged, and, issued, a, condemnation, declaring, that, origen, s, ordination, by, a, foreign, bishop, was, an, act, of, insubordination, eusebius, reports, that, as, a, result, of, demetrius, s, condemnations, origen, decided, not, to, return, to, alexandria, and, instead, to, take, up, permanent, residence, in, caesarea, john, anthony, mcguckin, however, argues, that, origen, had, probably, already, been, planning, to, stay, in, caesarea, the, palestinian, bishops, declared, origen, the, chief, theologian, of, caesarea, firmilian, the, bishop, of, caesarea, mazaca, in, cappadocia, was, such, a, devoted, disciple, of, origen, that, he, begged, him, to, come, to, cappadocia, and, teach, there, demetrius, raised, a, storm, of, protests, against, the, bishops, of, palestine, and, the, church, synod, in, rome, according, to, eusebius, demetrius, published, the, allegation, that, origen, had, secretly, castrated, himself, a, capital, offense, under, roman, law, at, the, time, and, one, which, would, have, made, origen, s, ordination, invalid, since, eunuchs, were, forbidden, from, becoming, priests, demetrius, also, alleged, that, origen, had, taught, an, extreme, form, of, apokatastasis, which, held, that, all, beings, including, even, satan, himself, would, eventually, attain, salvation, this, allegation, probably, arose, from, a, misunderstanding, of, origen, s, argument, during, a, debate, with, the, valentinian, gnostic, teacher, candidus, candidus, had, argued, in, favor, of, predestination, by, declaring, that, the, devil, was, beyond, salvation, origen, had, responded, by, arguing, that, if, the, devil, is, destined, for, eternal, damnation, it, was, on, account, of, his, actions, which, were, the, result, of, his, own, free, will, therefore, origen, had, declared, that, satan, was, only, morally, reprobate, not, absolutely, reprobate, demetrius, died, in, 232, less, than, a, year, after, origen, s, departure, from, alexandria, the, accusations, against, origen, faded, with, the, death, of, demetrius, but, they, did, not, disappear, entirely, and, they, continued, to, haunt, him, for, the, rest, of, his, career, origen, defended, himself, in, his, letter, to, friends, in, alexandria, in, which, he, vehemently, denied, that, he, had, ever, taught, that, the, devil, would, attain, salvation, and, insisted, that, the, very, notion, of, the, devil, attaining, salvation, was, simply, ludicrous, it, was, like, a, spark, falling, in, our, deepest, soul, setting, it, on, fire, making, it, burst, into, flame, within, us, it, was, at, the, same, time, a, love, for, the, holy, word, the, most, beautiful, object, of, all, that, by, its, ineffable, beauty, attracts, all, things, to, itself, with, irresistible, force, and, it, was, also, love, for, this, man, the, friend, and, advocate, of, the, holy, word, i, was, thus, persuaded, to, give, up, all, other, goals, i, had, only, one, remaining, object, that, i, valued, and, longed, for, philosophy, and, that, divine, man, who, was, my, master, of, philosophy, during, his, early, years, in, caesarea, origen, s, primary, task, was, the, establishment, of, a, christian, school, caesarea, had, long, been, seen, as, a, center, of, learning, for, jews, and, hellenistic, philosophers, but, until, origen, s, arrival, it, had, lacked, a, christian, center, of, higher, education, according, to, eusebius, the, school, origen, founded, was, primarily, targeted, towards, young, pagans, who, had, expressed, interest, in, christianity, but, were, not, yet, ready, to, ask, for, baptism, the, school, therefore, sought, to, explain, christian, teachings, through, middle, platonism, origen, started, his, curriculum, by, teaching, his, students, classical, socratic, reasoning, after, they, had, mastered, this, he, taught, them, cosmology, and, natural, history, finally, once, they, had, mastered, all, of, these, subjects, he, taught, them, theology, which, was, the, highest, of, all, philosophies, the, accumulation, of, everything, they, had, previously, learned, with, the, establishment, of, the, caesarean, school, origen, s, reputation, as, a, scholar, and, theologian, reached, its, zenith, and, he, became, known, throughout, the, mediterranean, world, as, a, brilliant, intellectual, the, hierarchs, of, the, palestinian, and, arabian, church, synods, regarded, origen, as, the, ultimate, expert, on, all, matters, dealing, with, theology, while, teaching, in, caesarea, origen, resumed, work, on, his, commentary, on, john, composing, at, least, books, six, through, ten, in, the, first, of, these, books, origen, compares, himself, to, an, israelite, who, has, escaped, the, perverse, persecution, of, the, egyptians, origen, also, wrote, the, treatise, on, prayer, at, the, request, of, his, friend, ambrose, and, tatiana, referred, to, as, the, sister, of, ambrose, in, which, he, analyzes, the, different, types, of, prayers, described, in, the, bible, and, offers, a, detailed, exegesis, on, the, lord, s, prayer, pagans, also, took, a, fascination, with, origen, the, neoplatonist, philosopher, porphyry, heard, of, origen, s, fame, and, traveled, to, caesarea, to, listen, to, his, lectures, porphyry, recounts, that, origen, had, extensively, studied, the, teachings, of, pythagoras, plato, and, aristotle, but, also, those, of, important, middle, platonists, neopythagoreans, and, stoics, including, numenius, of, apamea, chronius, apollophanes, longinus, moderatus, of, gades, nicomachus, chaeremon, and, cornutus, nonetheless, porphyry, accused, origen, of, having, betrayed, true, philosophy, by, subjugating, its, insights, to, the, exegesis, of, the, christian, scriptures, eusebius, reports, that, origen, was, summoned, from, caesarea, to, antioch, at, the, behest, of, julia, avita, mamaea, the, mother, of, roman, emperor, severus, alexander, to, discuss, christian, philosophy, and, doctrine, with, her, in, 235, approximately, three, years, after, origen, began, teaching, in, caesarea, alexander, severus, who, had, been, tolerant, towards, christians, was, murdered, and, emperor, maximinus, thrax, instigated, a, purge, of, all, those, who, had, supported, his, predecessor, his, pogroms, targeted, christian, leaders, and, in, rome, pope, pontianus, and, hippolytus, of, rome, were, both, sent, into, exile, origen, knew, that, he, was, in, danger, and, went, into, hiding, in, the, home, of, a, faithful, christian, woman, named, juliana, the, virgin, who, had, been, a, student, of, the, ebionite, leader, symmachus, origen, s, close, friend, and, longtime, patron, ambrose, was, arrested, in, nicomedia, and, protoctetes, the, leading, priest, in, caesarea, was, also, arrested, in, their, honor, origen, composed, his, treatise, exhortation, to, martyrdom, which, is, now, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, classics, of, christian, resistance, literature, after, coming, out, of, hiding, following, maximinus, s, death, origen, founded, a, school, of, which, gregory, thaumaturgus, later, bishop, of, pontus, was, one, of, the, pupils, he, preached, regularly, on, wednesdays, and, fridays, and, later, daily, sometime, between, 238, and, 244, origen, visited, athens, where, he, completed, his, commentary, on, the, book, of, ezekiel, and, began, writing, his, commentary, on, the, song, of, songs, after, visiting, athens, he, visited, ambrose, in, nicomedia, according, to, porphyry, origen, also, travelled, to, rome, or, antioch, where, he, met, plotinus, the, founder, of, neoplatonism, the, christians, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, continued, to, revere, origen, as, the, most, orthodox, of, all, theologians, and, when, the, palestinian, hierarchs, learned, that, beryllus, the, bishop, of, bostra, and, one, of, the, most, energetic, christian, leaders, of, the, time, had, been, preaching, adoptionism, the, belief, that, jesus, was, born, human, and, only, became, divine, after, his, baptism, they, sent, origen, to, convert, him, to, orthodoxy, origen, engaged, beryllus, in, a, public, disputation, which, went, so, successfully, that, beryllus, promised, only, to, teach, origen, s, theology, from, then, on, on, another, occasion, a, christian, leader, in, arabia, named, heracleides, began, teaching, that, the, soul, was, mortal, and, that, it, perished, with, the, body, origen, refuted, these, teachings, arguing, that, the, soul, is, immortal, and, can, never, die, in, c, 249, the, plague, of, cyprian, broke, out, in, 250, emperor, decius, believing, that, the, plague, was, caused, by, christians, failure, to, recognise, him, as, divine, issued, a, decree, for, christians, to, be, persecuted, this, time, origen, did, not, escape, eusebius, recounts, how, origen, suffered, bodily, tortures, and, torments, under, the, iron, collar, and, in, the, dungeon, and, how, for, many, days, with, his, feet, stretched, four, spaces, in, the, stocks, the, governor, of, caesarea, gave, very, specific, orders, that, origen, was, not, to, be, killed, until, he, had, publicly, renounced, his, faith, in, christ, origen, endured, two, years, of, imprisonment, and, torture, but, obstinately, refused, to, renounce, his, faith, in, june, 251, decius, was, killed, fighting, the, goths, in, the, battle, of, abritus, and, origen, was, released, from, prison, nonetheless, origen, s, health, was, broken, by, the, physical, tortures, enacted, on, him, and, he, died, less, than, a, year, later, at, the, age, of, sixty, nine, a, later, legend, recounted, by, jerome, and, numerous, itineraries, places, his, death, and, burial, at, tyre, but, little, value, can, be, attached, to, this, origen, was, an, extremely, prolific, writer, according, to, epiphanius, he, wrote, a, grand, total, of, roughly, 6, 000, works, over, the, course, of, his, lifetime, most, scholars, agree, that, this, estimate, is, probably, somewhat, exaggerated, according, to, jerome, eusebius, listed, the, titles, of, just, under, 2, 000, treatises, written, by, origen, in, his, lost, life, of, pamphilus, jerome, compiled, an, abbreviated, list, of, origen, s, major, treatises, itemizing, 800, different, titles, by, far, the, most, important, work, of, origen, on, textual, criticism, was, the, hexapla, sixfold, a, massive, comparative, study, of, various, translations, of, the, old, testament, in, six, columns, hebrew, hebrew, in, greek, characters, the, septuagint, and, the, greek, translations, of, theodotion, a, jewish, scholar, from, c, 180, ad, aquila, of, sinope, another, jewish, scholar, from, c, 117, 138, and, symmachus, an, ebionite, scholar, from, c, 193, 211, origen, was, the, first, christian, scholar, to, introduce, critical, markers, to, a, biblical, text, he, marked, the, septuagint, column, of, the, hexapla, using, signs, adapted, from, those, used, by, the, textual, critics, of, the, great, library, of, alexandria, a, passage, found, in, the, septuagint, that, was, not, found, in, the, hebrew, text, would, be, marked, with, an, asterisk, and, a, passage, that, was, found, in, other, greek, translations, but, not, in, the, septuagint, would, be, marked, with, an, obelus, the, hexapla, was, the, cornerstone, of, the, great, library, of, caesarea, which, origen, founded, it, was, still, the, centerpiece, of, the, library, s, collection, by, the, time, of, jerome, who, records, having, used, it, in, his, letters, on, multiple, occasions, when, emperor, constantine, the, great, ordered, fifty, complete, copies, of, the, bible, to, be, transcribed, and, disseminated, across, the, empire, eusebius, used, the, hexapla, as, the, master, copy, for, the, old, testament, although, the, original, hexapla, has, been, lost, the, text, of, it, has, survived, in, numerous, fragments, and, a, more, or, less, complete, syriac, translation, of, the, greek, column, made, by, the, seventh, century, bishop, paul, of, tella, has, also, survived, for, some, sections, of, the, hexapla, origen, included, additional, columns, containing, other, greek, translations, for, the, book, of, psalms, he, included, no, less, than, eight, greek, translations, making, this, section, known, as, enneapla, ninefold, origen, also, produced, the, tetrapla, fourfold, a, smaller, abridged, version, of, the, hexapla, containing, only, the, four, greek, translations, and, not, the, original, hebrew, text, according, to, jerome, s, epistle, 33, origen, wrote, extensive, scholia, on, the, books, of, exodus, leviticus, isaiah, psalms, 1, 15, ecclesiastes, and, the, gospel, of, john, none, of, these, scholia, have, survived, intact, but, parts, of, them, were, incorporated, into, the, catenaea, a, collection, of, excerpts, from, major, works, of, biblical, commentary, written, by, the, church, fathers, other, fragments, of, the, scholia, are, preserved, in, origen, s, philocalia, and, in, pamphilus, of, caesarea, s, apology, for, origen, the, stromateis, were, of, a, similar, character, and, the, margin, of, codex, athous, laura, 184, contains, citations, from, this, work, on, romans, 9, 23, i, corinthians, 6, 14, 7, 31, 34, 9, 20, 21, 10, 9, besides, a, few, other, fragments, origen, composed, homilies, covering, almost, the, entire, bible, there, are, 205, and, possibly, 279, homilies, of, origen, that, are, extant, either, in, greek, or, in, latin, translations, the, homilies, preserved, are, on, genesis, 16, exodus, 13, leviticus, 16, numbers, 28, joshua, 26, judges, 9, i, sam, 2, psalms, 36, 38, 9, canticles, 2, isaiah, 9, jeremiah, 7, greek, 2, latin, 12, greek, and, latin, ezekiel, 14, and, luke, 39, the, homilies, were, preached, in, the, church, at, caesarea, with, the, exception, of, the, two, on, 1, samuel, which, were, delivered, in, jerusalem, nautin, has, argued, that, they, were, all, preached, in, a, three, year, liturgical, cycle, some, time, between, 238, and, 244, preceding, the, commentary, on, the, song, of, songs, where, origen, refers, to, homilies, on, judges, exodus, numbers, and, a, work, on, leviticus, on, june, 11, 2012, the, bavarian, state, library, announced, that, the, italian, philologist, marina, molin, pradel, had, discovered, twenty, nine, previously, unknown, homilies, by, origen, in, a, twelfth, century, byzantine, manuscript, from, their, collection, prof, lorenzo, perrone, of, bologna, university, and, other, experts, confirmed, the, authenticity, of, the, homilies, the, texts, of, these, manuscripts, can, be, found, online, origen, is, the, main, source, of, information, on, the, use, of, the, texts, that, were, later, officially, canonized, as, the, new, testament, the, information, used, to, create, the, late, fourth, century, easter, letter, which, declared, accepted, christian, writings, was, probably, based, on, the, lists, given, in, eusebius, s, ecclesiastical, history, he, 3, 25, and, 6, 25, which, were, both, primarily, based, on, information, provided, by, origen, origen, accepted, the, authenticity, of, the, epistles, of, 1, john, 1, peter, and, jude, without, question, and, accepted, the, epistle, of, james, as, authentic, with, only, slight, hesitation, he, also, refers, to, 2, john, 3, john, and, 2, peter, but, notes, that, all, three, were, suspected, to, be, forgeries, origen, may, have, also, considered, other, writings, to, be, inspired, that, were, rejected, by, later, authors, including, the, epistle, of, barnabas, shepherd, of, hermas, and, 1, clement, origen, is, not, the, originator, of, the, idea, of, biblical, canon, but, he, certainly, gives, the, philosophical, and, literary, interpretative, underpinnings, for, the, whole, notion, origen, s, commentaries, written, on, specific, books, of, scripture, are, much, more, focused, on, systematic, exegesis, than, his, homilies, in, these, writings, origen, applies, the, precise, critical, methodology, that, had, been, developed, by, the, scholars, of, the, mouseion, in, alexandria, to, the, christian, scriptures, the, commentaries, also, display, origen, s, impressive, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, various, subjects, and, his, ability, to, cross, reference, specific, words, listing, every, place, in, which, a, word, appears, in, the, scriptures, along, with, all, the, word, s, known, meanings, a, feat, made, all, the, more, impressive, by, the, fact, that, he, did, this, in, a, time, when, bible, concordances, had, not, yet, been, compiled, origen, s, massive, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, john, which, spanned, more, than, thirty, two, volumes, once, it, was, completed, was, written, with, the, specific, intention, not, only, to, expound, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, but, also, to, refute, the, interpretations, of, the, valentinian, gnostic, teacher, heracleon, who, had, used, the, gospel, of, john, to, support, his, argument, that, there, were, really, two, gods, not, one, of, the, original, thirty, two, books, in, the, commentary, on, john, only, nine, have, been, preserved, books, i, ii, vi, x, xiii, xx, xxviii, xxxii, and, a, fragment, of, xix, of, the, original, twenty, five, books, in, origen, s, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, only, eight, have, survived, in, the, original, greek, books, 10, 17, covering, matthew, 13, 36, 22, 33, an, anonymous, latin, translation, beginning, at, the, point, corresponding, to, book, 12, chapter, 9, of, the, greek, text, and, covering, matthew, 16, 13, 27, 66, has, also, survived, the, translation, contains, parts, that, are, not, found, in, the, original, greek, and, is, missing, parts, that, are, found, in, it, origen, s, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, was, universally, regarded, as, a, classic, even, after, his, condemnation, and, it, ultimately, became, the, work, which, established, the, gospel, of, matthew, as, the, primary, gospel, origen, s, commentary, on, the, epistle, to, the, romans, was, originally, fifteen, books, long, but, only, tiny, fragments, of, it, have, survived, in, the, original, greek, an, abbreviated, latin, translation, in, ten, books, was, produced, by, the, monk, tyrannius, rufinus, at, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, the, historian, socrates, scholasticus, records, that, origen, had, included, an, extensive, discussion, of, the, application, of, the, title, theotokos, to, the, virgin, mary, in, his, commentary, but, this, discussion, is, not, found, in, rufinus, s, translation, probably, because, rufinus, did, not, approve, of, origen, s, position, on, the, matter, whatever, that, might, have, been, origen, also, composed, a, commentary, on, the, song, of, songs, in, which, he, took, explicit, care, to, explain, why, the, song, of, songs, was, relevant, to, a, christian, audience, the, commentary, on, the, song, of, songs, was, origen, s, most, celebrated, commentary, and, jerome, famously, writes, in, his, preface, to, his, translation, of, two, of, origen, s, homilies, over, the, song, of, songs, that, in, his, other, works, origen, habitually, excels, others, in, this, commentary, he, excelled, himself, origen, expanded, on, the, exegesis, of, the, jewish, rabbi, akiva, interpreting, the, song, of, songs, as, a, mystical, allegory, in, which, the, bridegroom, represents, the, logos, and, the, bride, represents, the, soul, of, the, believer, this, was, the, first, christian, commentary, to, expound, such, an, interpretation, and, it, became, extremely, influential, on, later, interpretations, of, the, song, of, songs, despite, this, the, commentary, now, only, survives, in, part, through, a, latin, translation, of, it, made, by, tyrannius, rufinus, in, 410, fragments, of, some, other, commentaries, survive, citations, in, origen, s, philokalia, include, fragments, of, the, third, book, of, the, commentary, on, genesis, there, is, also, ps, i, iv, 1, the, small, commentary, on, canticles, and, the, second, book, of, the, large, commentary, on, the, same, the, twentieth, book, of, the, commentary, on, ezekiel, and, the, commentary, on, hosea, of, the, non, extant, commentaries, there, is, limited, evidence, of, their, arrangement, origen, s, on, the, first, principles, was, the, first, ever, systematic, exposition, of, christian, theology, he, composed, it, as, a, young, man, between, 220, and, 230, while, he, was, still, living, in, alexandria, fragments, from, books, 3, 1, and, 4, 1, 3, of, origen, s, greek, original, are, preserved, in, origen, s, philokalia, a, few, smaller, quotations, of, the, original, greek, are, preserved, in, justinian, s, letter, to, mennas, the, vast, majority, of, the, text, has, only, survived, in, a, heavily, abridged, latin, translation, produced, by, tyrannius, rufinus, in, 397, on, the, first, principles, begins, with, an, essay, explaining, the, nature, of, theology, book, one, describes, the, heavenly, world, and, includes, descriptions, of, the, oneness, of, god, the, relationship, between, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, the, nature, of, the, divine, spirit, reason, and, angels, book, two, describes, the, world, of, man, including, the, incarnation, of, the, logos, the, soul, free, will, and, eschatology, book, three, deals, with, cosmology, sin, and, redemption, book, four, deals, with, teleology, and, the, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, against, celsus, greek, latin, contra, celsum, preserved, entirely, in, greek, was, origen, s, last, treatise, written, about, 248, it, is, an, apologetic, work, defending, orthodox, christianity, against, the, attacks, of, the, pagan, philosopher, celsus, who, was, seen, in, the, ancient, world, as, early, christianity, s, foremost, opponent, in, 178, celsus, had, written, a, polemic, entitled, on, the, true, word, in, which, he, had, made, numerous, arguments, against, christianity, the, church, had, responded, by, ignoring, celsus, s, attacks, but, origen, s, patron, ambrose, brought, the, matter, to, his, attention, origen, initially, wanted, to, ignore, celsus, and, let, his, attacks, fade, but, one, of, celsus, s, major, claims, which, held, that, no, self, respecting, philosopher, of, the, platonic, tradition, would, ever, be, so, stupid, as, to, become, a, christian, provoked, him, to, write, a, rebuttal, in, the, book, origen, systematically, refutes, each, of, celsus, arguments, point, by, point, and, argues, for, a, rational, basis, of, christian, faith, origen, draws, heavily, on, the, teachings, of, plato, and, argues, that, christianity, and, greek, philosophy, are, not, incompatible, and, that, philosophy, contains, much, that, is, true, and, admirable, but, that, the, bible, contains, far, greater, wisdom, than, anything, greek, philosophers, could, ever, grasp, origen, responds, to, celsus, s, accusation, that, jesus, had, performed, his, miracles, using, magic, rather, than, divine, powers, by, asserting, that, unlike, magicians, jesus, had, not, performed, his, miracles, for, show, but, rather, to, reform, his, audiences, contra, celsum, became, the, most, influential, of, all, early, christian, apologetics, works, before, it, was, written, christianity, was, seen, by, many, as, merely, a, folk, religion, for, the, illiterate, and, uneducated, but, origen, raised, it, to, a, level, of, academic, respectability, eusebius, admired, against, celsus, so, much, that, in, his, against, hierocles, 1, he, declared, that, against, celsus, provided, an, adequate, rebuttal, to, all, criticisms, the, church, would, ever, face, between, 232, and, 235, while, in, caesarea, in, palestine, origen, wrote, on, prayer, of, which, the, full, text, has, been, preserved, in, the, original, greek, after, an, introduction, on, the, object, necessity, and, advantage, of, prayer, he, ends, with, an, exegesis, of, the, lord, s, prayer, concluding, with, remarks, on, the, position, place, and, attitude, to, be, assumed, during, prayer, as, well, as, on, the, classes, of, prayer, on, martyrdom, or, the, exhortation, to, martyrdom, also, preserved, entire, in, greek, was, written, some, time, after, the, beginning, of, the, persecution, of, maximinus, in, the, first, half, of, 235, in, it, origen, warns, against, any, trifling, with, idolatry, and, emphasises, the, duty, of, suffering, martyrdom, manfully, while, in, the, second, part, he, explains, the, meaning, of, martyrdom, the, papyri, discovered, at, tura, in, 1941, contained, the, greek, texts, of, two, previously, unknown, works, of, origen, neither, work, can, be, dated, precisely, though, both, were, probably, written, after, the, persecution, of, maximinus, in, 235, one, is, on, the, pascha, the, other, is, dialogue, with, heracleides, a, record, written, by, one, of, origen, s, stenographers, of, a, debate, between, origen, and, the, arabian, bishop, heracleides, a, quasi, monarchianist, who, taught, that, the, father, and, the, son, were, the, same, in, the, dialogue, origen, uses, socratic, questioning, to, persuade, heracleides, to, believe, in, the, logos, theology, in, which, the, son, or, logos, is, a, separate, entity, from, god, the, father, the, debate, between, origen, and, heracleides, and, origen, s, responses, in, particular, has, been, noted, for, its, unusually, cordial, and, respectful, nature, in, comparison, to, the, much, fiercer, polemics, of, tertullian, or, the, fourth, century, debates, between, trinitarians, and, arians, lost, works, include, two, books, on, the, resurrection, written, before, on, first, principles, and, also, two, dialogues, on, the, same, theme, dedicated, to, ambrose, eusebius, had, a, collection, of, more, than, one, hundred, letters, of, origen, and, the, list, of, jerome, speaks, of, several, books, of, his, epistles, except, for, a, few, fragments, only, three, letters, have, been, preserved, the, first, partly, preserved, in, the, latin, translation, of, rufinus, is, addressed, to, friends, in, alexandria, the, second, is, a, short, letter, to, gregory, thaumaturgus, preserved, in, the, philocalia, the, third, is, an, epistle, to, sextus, julius, africanus, extant, in, greek, replying, to, a, letter, from, africanus, also, extant, and, defending, the, authenticity, of, the, greek, additions, to, the, book, of, daniel, forgeries, of, the, writings, of, origen, made, in, his, lifetime, are, discussed, by, rufinus, in, de, adulteratione, librorum, origenis, the, dialogus, de, recta, in, deum, fide, the, philosophumena, attributed, to, hippolytus, of, rome, and, the, commentary, on, job, by, julian, the, arian, have, also, been, ascribed, to, him, origen, writes, that, jesus, was, the, firstborn, of, all, creation, assumed, a, body, and, a, human, soul, he, firmly, believed, that, jesus, had, a, human, soul, and, abhorred, docetism, the, teaching, which, held, that, jesus, had, come, to, earth, in, spirit, form, rather, than, a, physical, human, body, origen, envisioned, jesus, human, nature, as, the, one, soul, that, stayed, closest, to, god, and, remained, perfectly, faithful, to, him, even, when, all, other, souls, fell, away, at, jesus, s, incarnation, his, soul, became, fused, with, the, logos, and, they, intermingled, to, become, one, thus, according, to, origen, christ, was, both, human, and, divine, but, like, all, human, souls, christ, s, human, nature, was, existent, from, the, beginning, origen, was, the, first, to, propose, the, ransom, theory, of, atonement, in, its, fully, developed, form, although, irenaeus, had, previously, proposed, a, prototypical, form, of, it, according, to, this, theory, christ, s, death, on, the, cross, was, a, ransom, to, satan, in, exchange, for, humanity, s, liberation, this, theory, holds, that, satan, was, tricked, by, god, because, christ, was, not, only, free, of, sin, but, also, the, incarnate, deity, whom, satan, lacked, the, ability, to, enslave, the, theory, was, later, expanded, by, theologians, such, as, gregory, of, nyssa, and, rufinus, of, aquileia, in, the, eleventh, century, anselm, of, canterbury, criticized, the, ransom, theory, along, with, the, associated, christus, victor, theory, resulting, in, the, theory, s, decline, in, western, europe, the, theory, has, nonetheless, retained, some, of, its, popularity, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, one, of, origen, s, main, teachings, was, the, doctrine, of, the, preexistence, of, souls, which, held, that, before, god, created, the, material, world, he, created, a, vast, number, of, incorporeal, spiritual, intelligences, all, of, these, souls, were, at, first, devoted, to, the, contemplation, and, love, of, their, creator, but, as, the, fervor, of, the, divine, fire, cooled, almost, all, of, these, intelligences, eventually, grew, bored, of, contemplating, god, and, their, love, for, him, cooled, off, when, god, created, the, world, the, souls, which, had, previously, existed, without, bodies, became, incarnate, those, whose, love, for, god, diminished, the, most, became, demons, those, whose, love, diminished, moderately, became, human, souls, eventually, to, be, incarnated, in, fleshly, bodies, those, whose, love, diminished, the, least, became, angels, one, soul, however, who, remained, perfectly, devoted, to, god, became, through, love, one, with, the, word, logos, of, god, the, logos, eventually, took, flesh, and, was, born, of, the, virgin, mary, becoming, the, god, man, jesus, christ, in, recent, years, it, has, been, questioned, whether, origen, believed, this, being, in, reality, a, belief, of, his, disciples, and, a, misrepresentation, of, justinian, epiphanius, and, others, origen, may, or, may, not, have, believed, in, the, platonic, teaching, of, metempsychosis, the, transmigration, of, souls, i, e, reincarnation, he, explicitly, rejects, the, false, doctrine, of, the, transmigration, of, souls, into, bodies, but, this, may, refer, only, to, a, specific, kind, of, transmigration, geddes, macgregor, has, argued, that, origen, must, have, believed, in, metempsychosis, because, it, makes, sense, within, his, eschatology, and, is, never, explicitly, denied, in, the, bible, roger, e, olson, however, dismisses, the, view, that, origen, believed, in, reincarnation, as, a, new, age, misunderstanding, of, origen, s, teachings, it, is, certain, that, origen, rejected, the, stoic, doctrine, of, eternal, return, although, he, did, posit, the, existence, of, a, series, of, non, identical, worlds, origen, believed, that, eventually, the, whole, world, would, be, converted, to, christianity, since, the, world, is, continually, gaining, possession, of, more, souls, he, believed, that, the, kingdom, of, heaven, was, not, yet, come, but, that, it, was, the, duty, of, every, christian, to, make, the, eschatological, reality, of, the, kingdom, present, in, their, lives, origen, is, often, believed, to, be, a, universalist, who, suggested, that, all, people, might, eventually, attain, salvation, but, only, after, being, purged, of, their, sins, through, divine, fire, this, of, course, in, line, of, origen, s, allegorical, interpretation, was, not, literal, fire, but, rather, the, inner, anguish, of, knowing, one, s, own, sins, origen, was, also, careful, to, maintain, that, universal, salvation, was, merely, a, possibility, and, not, a, definitive, doctrine, jerome, quotes, origen, as, having, allegedly, written, that, after, aeons, and, the, one, restoration, of, all, things, the, state, of, gabriel, will, be, the, same, as, that, of, the, devil, paul, s, as, that, of, caiaphas, that, of, virgins, as, that, of, prostitutes, however, origen, expressly, states, in, his, letter, to, friends, in, alexandria, that, satan, and, those, who, are, cast, out, of, the, kingdom, of, god, would, not, be, included, in, the, final, salvation, origen, was, an, ardent, believer, in, free, will, and, he, adamantly, rejected, the, valentinian, idea, of, election, instead, origen, believed, that, even, disembodied, souls, have, the, power, to, make, their, own, decisions, furthermore, in, his, interpretation, of, the, story, of, jacob, and, esau, origen, argues, that, the, condition, into, which, a, person, is, born, is, actually, dependent, upon, what, their, souls, did, in, this, pre, existent, state, according, to, origen, the, superficial, unfairness, of, a, person, s, condition, at, birth, with, some, humans, being, poor, others, rich, some, being, sick, and, others, healthy, is, actually, a, by, product, of, what, the, person, s, soul, had, done, in, the, pre, existent, state, origen, defends, free, will, in, his, interpretations, of, instances, of, divine, foreknowledge, in, the, scriptures, arguing, that, jesus, s, knowledge, of, judas, s, future, betrayal, in, the, gospels, and, god, s, knowledge, of, israel, s, future, disobedience, in, the, deuteronomistic, history, only, show, that, god, knew, these, events, would, happen, in, advance, origen, therefore, concludes, that, the, individuals, involved, in, these, incidents, still, made, their, decisions, out, of, their, own, free, will, like, plato, plotinus, and, gregory, of, nyssa, origen, understands, that, only, the, agent, who, chooses, the, good, is, free, choosing, evil, is, never, free, but, slavery, origen, was, an, ardent, pacifist, and, in, his, against, celsus, he, argued, that, christianity, s, inherent, pacifism, was, one, of, the, most, outwardly, noticeable, aspects, of, the, religion, while, origen, did, admit, that, some, christians, served, in, the, roman, army, he, pointed, out, that, most, did, not, and, insisted, that, engaging, in, earthly, wars, was, against, the, way, of, christ, origen, accepted, that, it, was, sometimes, necessary, for, a, non, christian, state, to, wage, wars, but, insisted, that, it, was, impossible, for, a, christian, to, fight, in, such, a, war, without, compromising, his, or, her, faith, since, christ, had, absolutely, forbidden, violence, of, any, kind, origen, explained, the, violence, found, in, certain, passages, of, the, old, testament, as, allegorical, and, pointed, out, old, testament, passages, which, he, interpreted, as, supporting, nonviolence, such, as, psalm, 7, 4, 6, and, lamentations, 3, 27, 29, origen, maintained, that, if, everyone, were, peaceful, and, loving, like, christians, then, there, would, be, no, wars, and, the, empire, would, not, need, a, military, for, who, that, has, understanding, will, suppose, that, the, first, and, second, and, third, day, and, the, evening, and, the, morning, existed, without, a, sun, and, moon, and, stars, and, that, the, first, day, was, as, it, were, also, without, a, sky, and, who, is, so, foolish, as, to, suppose, that, god, after, the, manner, of, a, husbandman, planted, a, paradise, in, eden, towards, the, east, and, placed, in, it, a, tree, of, life, visible, and, palpable, so, that, one, tasting, of, the, fruit, by, the, bodily, teeth, obtained, life, and, again, that, one, was, a, partaker, of, good, and, evil, by, masticating, what, was, taken, from, the, tree, and, if, god, is, said, to, walk, in, the, paradise, in, the, evening, and, adam, to, hide, himself, under, a, tree, i, do, not, suppose, that, anyone, doubts, that, these, things, figuratively, indicate, certain, mysteries, the, history, having, taken, place, in, appearance, and, not, literally, origen, bases, his, theology, on, the, christian, scriptures, and, does, not, appeal, to, platonic, teachings, without, having, first, supported, his, argument, with, a, scriptural, basis, he, saw, the, scriptures, as, divinely, inspired, and, was, cautious, never, to, contradict, his, own, interpretation, of, what, was, written, in, them, nonetheless, origen, did, have, a, penchant, for, speculating, beyond, what, was, explicitly, stated, in, the, bible, and, this, habit, frequently, placed, him, in, the, hazy, realm, between, strict, orthodoxy, and, heresy, according, to, origen, there, are, two, kinds, of, biblical, literature, which, are, found, in, both, the, old, and, new, testaments, historia, history, or, narrative, and, nomothesia, legislation, or, ethical, prescription, origen, expressly, states, that, the, old, and, new, testaments, should, be, read, together, and, according, to, the, same, rules, origen, further, taught, that, there, were, three, different, ways, in, which, passages, of, scripture, could, be, interpreted, the, flesh, was, the, literal, historical, interpretation, of, the, passage, the, soul, was, the, moral, message, behind, the, passage, and, the, spirit, was, the, eternal, incorporeal, reality, that, the, passage, conveyed, in, origen, s, exegesis, the, book, of, proverbs, ecclesiastes, and, the, song, of, songs, represent, perfect, examples, of, the, bodily, soulful, and, spiritual, components, of, scripture, respectively, origen, saw, the, spiritual, interpretation, as, the, deepest, and, most, important, meaning, of, the, text, and, taught, that, some, passages, held, no, literal, meaning, at, all, and, that, their, meanings, were, purely, allegorical, nonetheless, he, stressed, that, the, passages, which, are, historically, true, are, far, more, numerous, than, those, which, are, composed, with, purely, spiritual, meanings, and, often, used, examples, from, corporeal, realities, origen, noticed, that, the, accounts, of, jesus, s, life, in, the, four, canonical, gospels, contain, irreconcilable, contradictions, but, he, argued, that, these, contradictions, did, not, undermine, the, spiritual, meanings, of, the, passages, in, question, origen, s, idea, of, a, twofold, creation, was, based, on, an, allegorical, interpretation, of, the, creation, story, found, in, the, first, two, chapters, of, the, book, of, genesis, the, first, creation, described, in, genesis, 1, 26, was, the, creation, of, the, primeval, spirits, who, are, made, in, the, image, of, god, and, are, therefore, incorporeal, like, him, the, second, creation, described, in, genesis, 2, 7, is, when, the, human, souls, are, given, ethereal, spiritual, bodies, and, the, description, in, genesis, 3, 21, of, god, clothing, adam, and, eve, in, tunics, of, skin, refers, to, the, transformation, of, these, spiritual, bodies, into, corporeal, ones, thus, each, phase, represents, a, degradation, from, the, original, state, of, incorporeal, holiness, origen, s, conception, of, god, the, father, is, apophatic, a, perfect, unity, invisible, and, incorporeal, transcending, all, things, material, and, therefore, inconceivable, and, incomprehensible, he, is, likewise, unchangeable, and, transcends, space, and, time, but, his, power, is, limited, by, his, goodness, justice, and, wisdom, and, though, entirely, free, from, necessity, his, goodness, and, omnipotence, constrained, him, to, reveal, himself, this, revelation, the, external, self, emanation, of, god, is, expressed, by, origen, in, various, ways, the, logos, being, only, one, of, many, the, revelation, was, the, first, creation, of, god, cf, proverbs, 8, 22, in, order, to, afford, creative, mediation, between, god, and, the, world, such, mediation, being, necessary, because, god, as, changeless, unity, could, not, be, the, source, of, a, multitudinous, creation, the, logos, is, the, rational, creative, principle, that, permeates, the, universe, the, logos, acts, on, all, human, beings, through, their, capacity, for, logic, and, rational, thought, guiding, them, to, the, truth, of, god, s, revelation, as, they, progress, in, their, rational, thinking, all, humans, become, more, like, christ, nonetheless, they, retain, their, individuality, and, do, not, become, subsumed, into, christ, creation, came, into, existence, only, through, the, logos, and, god, s, nearest, approach, to, the, world, is, the, command, to, create, while, the, logos, is, substantially, a, unity, he, comprehends, a, multiplicity, of, concepts, so, that, origen, terms, him, in, platonic, fashion, essence, of, essences, and, idea, of, ideas, origen, significantly, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, idea, of, the, trinity, he, declared, the, holy, spirit, to, be, a, part, of, the, godhead, and, interpreted, the, parable, of, the, lost, coin, to, mean, that, the, holy, spirit, dwells, within, each, and, every, person, and, that, the, inspiration, of, the, holy, spirit, was, necessary, for, any, kind, of, speech, dealing, with, god, origen, taught, that, the, activity, of, all, three, parts, of, the, trinity, was, necessary, for, a, person, to, attain, salvation, in, one, fragment, preserved, by, rufinus, in, his, latin, translation, of, pamphilus, s, defense, of, origen, origen, seems, to, apply, the, phrase, homoo, sios, of, the, same, substance, to, the, relationship, between, the, father, and, the, son, but, williams, states, that, it, is, impossible, to, verify, whether, the, quote, that, uses, the, word, homoousios, really, comes, from, pamphilus, at, all, let, alone, origen, in, other, passages, origen, rejected, the, belief, that, the, son, and, the, father, were, one, hypostasis, as, heretical, according, to, rowan, williams, because, the, words, ousia, and, hypostasis, were, used, synonymously, in, origen, s, time, origen, almost, certainly, would, have, rejected, homoousios, as, a, description, for, the, relationship, between, the, father, and, the, son, as, heretical, nonetheless, origen, was, a, subordinationist, meaning, he, believed, that, the, father, was, superior, to, the, son, and, the, son, was, superior, to, the, holy, spirit, a, model, based, on, platonic, proportions, jerome, records, that, origen, had, written, that, god, the, father, is, invisible, to, all, beings, including, even, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, and, that, the, son, is, invisible, to, the, holy, spirit, as, well, at, one, point, origen, suggests, that, the, son, was, created, by, the, father, and, that, the, holy, spirit, was, created, by, the, son, but, at, another, point, he, writes, that, up, to, the, present, i, have, been, able, to, find, no, passage, in, the, scriptures, that, the, holy, spirit, is, a, created, being, at, the, time, when, origen, was, alive, orthodox, views, on, the, trinity, had, not, yet, been, formulated, and, subordinationism, was, not, yet, considered, heretical, in, fact, virtually, all, orthodox, theologians, prior, to, the, arian, controversy, in, the, latter, half, of, the, fourth, century, were, subordinationists, to, some, extent, origen, s, subordinationism, may, have, developed, out, of, his, efforts, to, defend, the, unity, of, god, against, the, gnostics, origen, is, often, seen, as, the, first, major, christian, theologian, though, his, orthodoxy, had, been, questioned, in, alexandria, while, he, was, alive, after, origen, s, death, pope, dionysius, of, alexandria, became, one, of, the, foremost, proponents, of, origen, s, theology, every, christian, theologian, who, came, after, him, was, influenced, by, his, theology, whether, directly, or, indirectly, origen, s, contributions, to, theology, were, so, vast, and, complex, however, that, his, followers, frequently, emphasized, drastically, different, parts, of, his, teachings, to, the, expense, of, other, parts, dionysius, emphasized, origen, s, subordinationist, views, which, led, dionysius, to, deny, the, unity, of, the, trinity, causing, controversy, throughout, north, africa, at, the, same, time, origen, s, other, disciple, theognostus, of, alexandria, taught, that, the, father, and, the, son, were, of, one, substance, for, centuries, after, his, death, origen, was, regarded, as, the, bastion, of, orthodoxy, and, his, philosophy, practically, defined, eastern, christianity, origen, was, revered, as, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, christian, teachers, he, was, especially, beloved, by, monks, who, saw, themselves, as, continuing, in, origen, s, ascetic, legacy, as, time, progressed, however, origen, became, criticized, under, the, standard, of, orthodoxy, in, later, eras, rather, than, the, standards, of, his, own, lifetime, in, the, early, fourth, century, the, christian, writer, methodius, of, olympus, criticized, some, of, origen, s, more, speculative, arguments, but, otherwise, agreed, with, origen, on, all, other, points, of, theology, peter, of, antioch, and, eustathius, of, antioch, criticized, origen, as, heretical, both, orthodox, and, heterodox, theologians, claimed, to, be, following, in, the, tradition, origen, had, established, athanasius, of, alexandria, the, most, prominent, supporter, of, the, holy, trinity, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, was, deeply, influenced, by, origen, and, so, were, basil, of, caesarea, gregory, of, nyssa, and, gregory, of, nazianzus, the, so, called, cappadocian, fathers, at, the, same, time, origen, deeply, influenced, arius, of, alexandria, and, later, followers, of, arianism, although, the, extent, of, the, relationship, between, the, two, is, debated, in, antiquity, many, orthodox, christians, believed, that, origen, was, the, true, and, ultimate, source, of, the, arian, heresy, the, first, origenist, crisis, began, in, the, late, fourth, century, coinciding, with, the, beginning, of, monasticism, in, palestine, the, first, stirring, of, the, controversy, came, from, the, cyprian, bishop, epiphanius, of, salamis, who, was, determined, to, root, out, all, heresies, and, refute, them, epiphanius, attacked, origen, in, his, anti, heretical, treatises, ancoratus, 375, and, panarion, 376, compiling, a, list, of, teachings, origen, had, espoused, that, epiphanius, regarded, as, heretical, epiphanius, s, treatises, portray, origen, as, an, originally, orthodox, christian, who, had, been, corrupted, and, turned, into, a, heretic, by, the, evils, of, greek, education, epiphanius, particularly, objected, to, origen, s, subordinationism, his, excessive, use, of, allegorical, hermeneutic, and, his, habit, of, proposing, ideas, about, the, bible, speculatively, as, exercises, rather, than, dogmatically, epiphanius, asked, john, the, bishop, of, jerusalem, to, condemn, origen, as, a, heretic, john, refused, on, the, grounds, that, a, person, could, not, be, retroactively, condemned, as, a, heretic, after, that, person, had, already, died, in, 393, a, monk, named, atarbius, advanced, a, petition, to, have, origen, and, his, writings, censured, tyrannius, rufinus, a, priest, at, the, monastery, on, the, mount, of, olives, who, had, been, ordained, by, john, of, jerusalem, and, was, a, longtime, admirer, of, origen, rejected, the, petition, outright, rufinus, s, close, friend, and, associate, jerome, who, had, also, studied, origen, however, came, to, agree, with, the, petition, around, the, same, time, john, cassian, an, eastern, monk, introduced, origen, s, teachings, to, the, west, in, 394, epiphanius, wrote, to, john, of, jerusalem, again, asking, for, origen, to, be, condemned, insisting, that, origen, s, writings, denigrated, human, sexual, reproduction, and, accusing, him, of, having, been, an, encratite, john, once, again, denied, this, request, by, 395, jerome, had, allied, himself, with, the, anti, origenists, and, begged, john, of, jerusalem, to, condemn, origen, a, plea, which, john, once, again, refused, epiphanius, launched, a, campaign, against, john, openly, preaching, that, john, was, an, origenist, deviant, he, successfully, persuaded, jerome, to, break, communion, with, john, and, ordained, jerome, s, brother, paulinianus, as, a, priest, in, defiance, of, john, s, authority, in, 397, rufinus, published, a, latin, translation, of, origen, s, on, first, principles, rufinus, was, convinced, that, origen, s, original, treatise, had, been, interpolated, by, heretics, and, that, these, interpolations, were, the, source, of, the, heterodox, teachings, found, in, it, he, therefore, heavily, modified, origen, s, text, omitting, and, altering, any, parts, which, disagreed, with, contemporary, christian, orthodoxy, in, the, introduction, to, this, translation, rufinus, mentioned, that, jerome, had, studied, under, origen, s, disciple, didymus, the, blind, implying, that, jerome, was, a, follower, of, origen, jerome, was, so, incensed, by, this, that, he, resolved, to, produce, his, own, latin, translation, of, on, the, first, principles, in, which, he, promised, to, translate, every, word, exactly, as, it, was, written, and, lay, bare, origen, s, heresies, to, the, whole, world, jerome, s, translation, has, been, lost, in, its, entirety, in, 399, the, origenist, crisis, reached, egypt, pope, theophilus, i, of, alexandria, was, sympathetic, to, the, supporters, of, origen, and, the, church, historian, sozomen, records, that, he, had, openly, preached, the, origenist, teaching, that, god, was, incorporeal, in, his, festal, letter, of, 399, he, denounced, those, who, believed, that, god, had, a, literal, human, like, body, calling, them, illiterate, simple, ones, a, large, mob, of, alexandrian, monks, who, regarded, god, as, anthropomorphic, rioted, in, the, streets, according, to, the, church, historian, socrates, scholasticus, in, order, to, prevent, a, riot, theophilus, made, a, sudden, about, face, and, began, denouncing, origen, in, 400, theophilus, summoned, a, council, in, alexandria, which, condemned, origen, and, all, his, followers, as, heretics, for, having, taught, that, god, was, incorporeal, which, they, decreed, contradicted, the, only, true, and, orthodox, position, which, was, that, god, had, a, literal, physical, body, resembling, that, of, a, human, theophilus, labeled, origen, as, the, hydra, of, all, heresies, and, persuaded, pope, anastasius, i, to, sign, the, letter, of, the, council, which, primarily, denounced, the, teachings, of, the, nitrian, monks, associated, with, evagrius, ponticus, in, 402, theophilus, expelled, origenist, monks, from, egyptian, monasteries, and, banished, the, four, monks, known, as, the, tall, brothers, who, were, leaders, of, the, nitrian, community, john, chrysostom, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, granted, the, tall, brothers, asylum, a, fact, which, theophilus, used, to, orchestrate, john, s, condemnation, and, removal, from, his, position, at, the, synod, of, the, oak, in, july, 403, once, john, chrysostom, had, been, deposed, theophilus, restored, normal, relations, with, the, origenist, monks, in, egypt, and, the, first, origenist, crisis, came, to, an, end, the, second, origenist, crisis, occurred, in, the, sixth, century, during, the, height, of, byzantine, monasticism, although, the, second, origenist, crisis, is, not, nearly, as, well, documented, as, the, first, it, seems, to, have, primarily, concerned, the, teachings, of, origen, s, later, followers, rather, than, what, origen, had, written, origen, s, disciple, evagrius, ponticus, had, advocated, contemplative, noetic, prayer, but, other, monastic, communities, prioritized, asceticism, in, prayer, emphasizing, fasting, labors, and, vigils, some, origenist, monks, in, palestine, referred, to, by, their, enemies, as, isochristoi, meaning, those, who, would, assume, equality, with, christ, emphasized, origen, s, teaching, of, the, pre, existence, of, souls, and, held, that, all, souls, were, originally, equal, to, christ, s, and, would, become, equal, again, at, the, end, of, time, another, faction, of, origenists, in, the, same, region, instead, insisted, that, christ, was, the, leader, of, many, brethren, as, the, first, created, being, this, faction, was, more, moderate, and, they, were, referred, to, by, their, opponents, as, protoktistoi, first, createds, both, factions, accused, the, other, of, heresy, and, other, christians, accused, both, of, them, of, heresy, the, protoktistoi, appealed, to, the, emperor, justinian, i, to, condemn, the, isochristoi, of, heresy, through, pelagius, the, papal, apocrisarius, in, 543, pelagius, presented, justinian, with, documents, including, a, letter, denouncing, origen, written, by, patriarch, mennas, of, constantinople, along, with, excerpts, from, origen, s, on, first, principles, and, several, anathemata, against, origen, a, domestic, synod, convened, to, address, the, issue, concluded, that, the, isochristoi, s, teachings, were, heretical, and, seeing, origen, as, the, ultimate, culprit, behind, the, heresy, denounced, origen, as, a, heretic, as, well, emperor, justinian, ordered, for, all, of, origen, s, writings, to, be, burned, in, the, west, the, decretum, gelasianum, which, was, written, sometime, between, 519, and, 553, listed, origen, as, an, author, whose, writings, were, to, be, categorically, banned, in, 553, during, the, early, days, of, the, second, council, of, constantinople, the, fifth, ecumenical, council, when, pope, vigilius, was, still, refusing, to, take, part, in, it, despite, justinian, holding, him, hostage, the, bishops, at, the, council, ratified, an, open, letter, which, condemned, origen, as, the, leader, of, the, isochristoi, the, letter, was, not, part, of, the, official, acts, of, the, council, and, it, more, or, less, repeated, the, edict, issued, by, the, synod, of, constantinople, in, 543, it, cites, objectionable, writings, attributed, to, origen, but, all, the, writings, referred, to, in, it, were, actually, written, by, evagrius, ponticus, after, the, council, officially, opened, but, while, pope, vigillius, was, still, refusing, to, take, part, justinian, presented, the, bishops, with, the, problem, of, a, text, known, as, the, three, chapters, which, attacked, the, antiochene, christology, the, bishops, drew, up, a, list, of, anathemata, against, the, heretical, teachings, contained, within, the, three, chapters, and, those, associated, with, them, in, the, official, text, of, the, eleventh, anathema, origen, is, condemned, as, a, christological, heretic, but, origen, s, name, does, not, appear, at, all, in, the, homonoia, the, first, draft, of, the, anathemata, issued, by, the, imperial, chancery, nor, does, it, appear, in, the, version, of, the, conciliar, proceedings, that, was, eventually, signed, by, pope, vigillius, a, long, time, afterwards, norman, p, tanner, s, edition, of, the, decrees, of, the, ecumenical, councils, georgetown, university, press, 1990, says, our, edition, does, not, include, the, text, of, the, anathemas, against, origen, since, recent, studies, have, shown, that, these, anathemas, cannot, be, attributed, to, this, council, these, discrepancies, may, indicate, that, origen, s, name, was, retrospectively, inserted, into, the, text, after, the, council, some, authorities, believe, these, anathemata, belong, to, an, earlier, local, synod, even, if, origen, s, name, did, appear, in, the, original, text, of, the, anathema, the, teachings, attributed, to, origen, that, are, condemned, in, the, anathema, were, actually, the, ideas, of, later, origenists, which, had, very, little, grounding, in, anything, origen, had, actually, written, in, fact, popes, vigilius, pelagius, i, pelagius, ii, and, gregory, the, great, were, only, aware, that, the, fifth, council, specifically, dealt, with, the, three, chapters, and, make, no, mention, of, origenism, or, universalism, nor, spoke, as, if, they, knew, of, its, condemnation, even, though, gregory, the, great, was, opposed, to, universalism, if, orthodoxy, were, a, matter, of, intention, no, theologian, could, be, more, orthodox, than, origen, none, more, devoted, to, the, cause, of, the, christian, faith, as, a, direct, result, of, the, numerous, condemnations, of, his, work, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, origen, s, voluminous, writings, have, survived, nonetheless, these, writings, still, amount, to, a, massive, number, of, greek, and, latin, texts, very, few, of, which, have, yet, been, translated, into, english, many, more, writings, have, survived, in, fragments, through, quotations, from, later, church, fathers, even, in, the, late, 14th, century, francesc, eiximenis, in, his, llibre, de, les, dones, produced, otherwise, unknown, quotations, from, origen, which, may, be, evidence, of, other, works, surviving, into, the, late, medieval, period, it, is, likely, that, the, writings, containing, origen, s, most, unusual, and, speculative, ideas, have, been, lost, to, time, making, it, nearly, impossible, to, determine, whether, origen, actually, held, the, heretical, views, which, the, anathemas, against, him, ascribed, to, him, nonetheless, in, spite, of, the, decrees, against, origen, the, church, remained, enamored, of, him, and, he, remained, a, central, figure, of, christian, theology, throughout, the, first, millennium, he, continued, to, be, revered, as, the, founder, of, biblical, exegesis, and, anyone, in, the, first, millennium, who, took, the, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, seriously, would, have, had, knowledge, of, origen, s, teachings, jerome, s, latin, translations, of, origen, s, homilies, were, widely, read, in, western, europe, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, origen, s, teachings, greatly, influenced, those, of, the, byzantine, monk, maximus, the, confessor, and, the, irish, theologian, john, scotus, eriugena, since, the, renaissance, the, debate, over, origen, s, orthodoxy, has, continued, to, rage, basilios, bessarion, a, greek, refugee, who, fled, to, italy, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, produced, a, latin, translation, of, origen, s, contra, celsum, which, was, printed, in, 1481, major, controversy, erupted, in, 1487, after, the, italian, humanist, scholar, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, issued, a, thesis, arguing, that, it, is, more, reasonable, to, believe, that, origen, was, saved, than, he, was, damned, a, papal, commission, condemned, pico, s, position, on, account, of, the, anathemas, against, origen, but, not, until, after, the, debate, had, received, considerable, attention, the, most, prominent, advocate, of, origen, during, the, renaissance, was, the, dutch, humanist, scholar, desiderius, erasmus, who, regarded, origen, as, the, greatest, of, all, christian, authors, and, wrote, in, a, letter, to, john, eck, that, he, learned, more, about, christian, philosophy, from, a, single, page, of, origen, than, from, ten, pages, of, augustine, erasmus, especially, admired, origen, for, his, lack, of, rhetorical, flourishes, which, were, so, common, in, the, writings, of, other, patristic, authors, erasmus, borrowed, heavily, from, origen, s, defense, of, free, will, in, on, first, principles, in, his, 1524, treatise, on, free, will, now, considered, his, most, important, theological, work, in, 1527, erasmus, translated, and, published, the, portion, of, origen, s, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, that, survived, only, in, greek, and, in, 1536, he, published, the, most, complete, edition, of, origen, s, writings, that, had, ever, been, published, at, that, time, while, origen, s, emphasis, on, the, human, effort, in, attaining, salvation, appealed, to, the, renaissance, humanists, it, made, him, far, less, appealing, to, the, proponents, of, the, reformation, martin, luther, deplored, origen, s, understanding, of, salvation, as, irredeemably, defective, and, declared, in, all, of, origen, there, is, not, one, word, about, christ, consequently, he, ordered, for, origen, s, writings, to, be, banned, nonetheless, the, earlier, czech, reformer, jan, hus, had, taken, inspiration, from, origen, for, his, view, that, the, church, is, a, spiritual, reality, rather, than, an, official, hierarchy, and, luther, s, contemporary, the, swiss, reformer, huldrych, zwingli, took, inspiration, from, origen, for, his, interpretation, of, the, eucharist, as, symbolic, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, english, cambridge, platonist, henry, more, was, a, devoted, origenist, and, although, he, did, reject, the, notion, of, universal, salvation, he, accepted, most, of, origen, s, other, teachings, pope, benedict, xvi, expressed, admiration, for, origen, describing, him, in, a, sermon, as, part, of, a, series, on, the, church, fathers, as, a, figure, crucial, to, the, whole, development, of, christian, thought, a, true, maestro, and, not, only, a, brilliant, theologian, but, also, an, exemplary, witness, of, the, doctrine, he, passed, on, he, concludes, the, sermon, by, inviting, his, audience, to, welcome, into, your, hearts, the, teaching, of, this, great, master, of, the, faith, modern, protestant, evangelicals, admire, origen, for, his, passionate, devotion, to, the, scriptures, but, are, frequently, baffled, or, even, appalled, by, his, allegorical, interpretation, of, them, which, many, believe, ignores, the, literal, historical, truth, behind, them, origen, is, often, noted, for, being, one, of, the, few, church, fathers, who, is, not, generally, regarded, as, a, saint, nevertheless, there, are, notable, individuals, who, referred, to, origen, as, st, origen, this, includes, anglicans, such, as, edward, welchman, john, howson, and, sir, winston, churchill, calvinists, such, as, pierre, bayle, georges, louis, liomin, and, heinrich, bullinger, american, scholar, and, orthodox, christian, david, bentley, hart, oriental, orthodox,
