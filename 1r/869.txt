george, armitage, miller, february, 3, 1920, july, 22, 2012, was, an, american, psychologist, who, was, one, of, the, founders, of, cognitive, psychology, and, more, broadly, of, cognitive, science, he, also, contributed, to, the, birth, of, psycholinguistics, miller, wrote, several, books, and, directed, the, development, of, wordnet, an, online, word, linkage, database, usable, by, computer, programs, he, authored, the, paper, the, magical, number, seven, plus, or, minus, two, in, which, he, observed, that, many, different, experimental, findings, considered, together, reveal, the, presence, of, an, average, limit, of, seven, for, human, short, term, memory, capacity, this, paper, is, frequently, cited, by, psychologists, and, in, the, wider, culture, miller, won, numerous, awards, including, the, national, medal, of, science, miller, began, his, career, when, the, reigning, theory, in, psychology, was, behaviorism, which, eschewed, the, study, of, mental, processes, and, focused, on, observable, behavior, rejecting, this, approach, miller, devised, experimental, techniques, and, mathematical, methods, to, analyze, mental, processes, focusing, particularly, on, speech, and, language, working, mostly, at, harvard, university, mit, and, princeton, university, he, went, on, to, become, one, of, the, founders, of, psycholinguistics, and, was, one, of, the, key, figures, in, founding, the, broader, new, field, of, cognitive, science, c, 1978, he, collaborated, and, co, authored, work, with, other, figures, in, cognitive, science, and, psycholinguistics, such, as, noam, chomsky, for, moving, psychology, into, the, realm, of, mental, processes, and, for, aligning, that, move, with, information, theory, computation, theory, and, linguistics, miller, is, considered, one, of, the, great, twentieth, century, psychologists, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, miller, as, the, 20th, most, cited, psychologist, of, that, era, miller, was, born, on, february, 3, 1920, in, charleston, west, virginia, the, son, of, george, e, miller, a, steel, company, executive, and, florence, n, e, armitage, miller, soon, after, his, birth, his, parents, divorced, and, he, lived, with, his, mother, during, the, great, depression, attending, public, school, and, graduating, from, charleston, high, school, in, 1937, he, moved, with, his, mother, and, stepfather, to, washington, d, c, and, attended, george, washington, university, for, a, year, his, family, practiced, christian, science, which, required, turning, to, prayer, rather, than, medical, science, for, healing, after, his, stepfather, was, transferred, to, birmingham, alabama, miller, transferred, to, the, university, of, alabama, at, the, university, of, alabama, he, took, courses, in, phonetics, voice, science, and, speech, pathology, earning, his, bachelor, s, degree, in, history, and, speech, in, 1940, and, a, master, s, in, a, speech, in, 1941, membership, in, the, drama, club, had, fostered, his, interest, in, courses, in, the, speech, department, he, was, also, influenced, by, professor, donald, ramsdell, who, introduced, him, both, to, psychology, and, indirectly, through, a, seminar, to, his, future, wife, katherine, james, they, married, on, november, 29, 1939, katherine, died, in, january, 1996, he, married, margaret, ferguson, skutch, page, in, 2008, miller, taught, the, course, introduction, to, psychology, at, alabama, for, two, years, he, enrolled, in, the, ph, d, program, in, psychology, at, harvard, university, in, 1943, after, coming, to, the, university, in, 1942, at, harvard, he, worked, in, psycho, acoustic, laboratory, under, the, supervision, of, stanley, smith, stevens, researching, military, voice, communications, for, the, army, signal, corps, during, world, war, ii, he, received, his, doctorate, in, 1946, his, doctoral, thesis, the, optimal, design, of, jamming, signals, was, classified, top, secret, by, the, us, army, after, receiving, his, doctorate, miller, stayed, at, harvard, as, a, research, fellow, continuing, his, research, on, speech, and, hearing, he, was, appointed, an, assistant, professor, of, psychology, in, 1948, the, course, he, developed, on, language, and, communication, eventually, led, to, his, first, major, book, language, and, communication, 1951, he, took, a, sabbatical, in, 1950, and, spent, a, year, as, a, visiting, fellow, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, princeton, to, pursue, his, interest, in, mathematics, miller, befriended, j, robert, oppenheimer, with, whom, he, played, squash, in, 1951, miller, joined, mit, as, an, associate, professor, of, psychology, he, led, the, psychology, group, at, the, mit, lincoln, lab, and, worked, on, voice, communication, and, human, engineering, a, notable, outcome, of, this, research, was, his, identification, of, the, minimal, voice, features, of, speech, required, for, it, to, be, intelligible, based, on, this, work, in, 1955, he, was, invited, to, talk, at, the, eastern, psychological, association, that, presentation, the, magical, number, seven, plus, or, minus, two, was, later, published, as, a, paper, which, went, on, to, be, a, legendary, one, in, cognitive, psychology, miller, moved, back, to, harvard, as, a, tenured, associate, professor, in, 1955, and, became, a, full, professor, in, 1958, expanding, his, research, into, how, language, affects, human, cognition, at, the, university, he, met, a, young, noam, chomsky, another, of, the, founders, of, cognitive, science, they, spent, a, summer, together, at, stanford, where, their, two, families, shared, a, house, in, 1958, 59, miller, took, leave, to, join, the, center, for, advanced, study, in, the, behavioral, sciences, at, palo, alto, california, now, at, stanford, university, there, he, collaborated, with, eugene, galanter, and, karl, pribram, on, the, book, plans, and, the, structure, of, behavior, in, 1960, along, with, jerome, s, bruner, he, co, founded, the, center, for, cognitive, studies, at, harvard, the, cognitive, term, was, a, break, from, the, then, dominant, school, of, behaviorism, which, insisted, cognition, was, not, fit, for, scientific, study, the, center, attracted, such, notable, visitors, as, jean, piaget, alexander, luria, and, chomsky, miller, then, became, the, chair, of, the, psychology, department, miller, was, instrumental, at, the, time, for, recruiting, timothy, leary, to, teach, at, harvard, miller, knew, leary, from, the, university, of, alabama, where, miller, was, teaching, psychology, and, leary, graduated, with, an, undergraduate, degree, from, the, department, in, 1967, miller, taught, at, rockefeller, university, for, a, year, as, a, visiting, professor, from, 1968, to, 1979, he, was, professor, at, the, rockefeller, and, continued, as, adjunct, professor, there, from, 1979, to, 1982, following, the, election, of, a, new, president, at, rockefeller, miller, moved, to, princeton, university, as, the, james, s, mcdonnell, distinguished, university, professor, of, psychology, at, princeton, he, helped, to, found, in, 1986, the, cognitive, science, laboratory, and, also, directed, the, mcdonnell, pew, program, in, cognitive, science, eventually, he, became, a, professor, emeritus, and, senior, research, psychologist, at, princeton, miller, had, honorary, doctorates, from, the, university, of, sussex, 1984, columbia, university, 1980, yale, university, 1979, catholic, university, of, louvain, 1978, carnegie, mellon, university, in, humane, letters, 2003, and, an, honorary, dsc, from, williams, college, 2000, he, was, elected, to, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1957, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1962, the, presidency, of, the, eastern, psychological, association, in, 1962, the, presidency, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1969, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1971, and, to, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1985, miller, was, the, keynote, speaker, at, the, first, convention, of, the, association, for, psychological, science, in, 1989, he, was, a, fulbright, research, fellow, at, oxford, university, in, 1964, 65, and, in, 1991, received, the, national, medal, of, science, in, his, later, years, miller, enjoyed, playing, golf, he, died, in, 2012, at, his, home, in, plainsboro, new, jersey, of, complications, of, pneumonia, and, dementia, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, margaret, the, children, from, his, first, marriage, son, donnally, james, and, daughter, nancy, saunders, two, stepsons, david, skutch, and, christopher, skutch, and, three, grandchildren, gavin, murray, miller, morgan, murray, miller, and, nathaniel, james, miller, miller, began, his, career, in, a, period, during, which, behaviorism, dominated, research, psychology, it, was, argued, that, observable, processes, are, the, proper, subject, matter, of, science, that, behavior, is, observable, and, mental, processes, are, not, thus, mental, processes, were, not, a, fit, topic, for, study, miller, disagreed, he, and, others, such, jerome, bruner, and, noam, chomsky, founded, the, field, of, cognitive, psychology, which, accepted, the, study, of, mental, processes, as, fundamental, to, an, understanding, of, complex, behavior, in, succeeding, years, this, cognitive, approach, largely, replaced, behaviorism, as, the, framework, governing, research, in, psychology, from, the, days, of, william, james, psychologists, had, distinguished, short, term, from, long, term, memory, while, short, term, memory, seemed, to, be, limited, its, limits, were, not, known, in, 1956, miller, put, a, number, on, that, limit, in, the, paper, the, magical, number, seven, plus, or, minus, two, he, derived, this, number, from, tasks, such, as, asking, a, person, to, repeat, a, set, of, digits, presenting, a, stimulus, and, a, label, and, requiring, recall, of, the, label, or, asking, the, person, to, quickly, count, things, in, a, group, in, all, three, cases, miller, found, the, average, limit, to, be, seven, items, he, later, had, mixed, feelings, about, this, work, feeling, that, it, had, been, often, been, misquoted, and, he, jokingly, suggested, that, he, was, being, persecuted, by, an, integer, miller, invented, the, term, chunk, to, characterize, the, way, that, individuals, could, cope, with, this, limitation, on, memory, effectively, reducing, the, number, of, elements, by, grouping, them, a, chunk, might, be, a, single, letter, or, a, familiar, word, or, even, a, larger, familiar, unit, these, and, related, ideas, strongly, influenced, the, budding, field, of, cognitive, psychology, for, many, years, starting, from, 1986, miller, directed, the, development, of, wordnet, a, large, computer, readable, electronic, reference, usable, in, applications, such, as, search, engines, which, was, created, by, a, team, that, included, christiane, fellbaum, among, others, wordnet, is, a, large, lexical, database, representing, human, semantic, memory, in, english, its, fundamental, building, block, is, a, synset, which, is, a, collection, of, synonyms, representing, a, concept, or, idea, words, can, be, in, multiple, synsets, the, entire, class, of, synsets, is, grouped, into, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and, adverbs, separately, with, links, existing, only, within, these, four, major, groups, but, not, between, them, going, beyond, a, thesaurus, wordnet, also, includes, inter, word, relationships, such, as, part, whole, relationships, and, hierarchies, of, inclusion, although, not, intended, to, be, a, dictionary, wordnet, did, have, many, short, definitions, added, to, it, as, time, went, on, miller, and, colleagues, had, planned, the, tool, to, test, psycholinguistic, theories, on, how, humans, use, and, understand, words, miller, also, later, worked, closely, with, entrepreneur, jeff, stibel, and, scientists, at, simpli, com, inc, on, a, meaning, based, keyword, search, engine, based, on, wordnet, wordnet, has, proved, to, be, extremely, influential, on, an, international, scale, it, has, now, been, emulated, by, wordnets, in, many, different, languages, miller, is, one, of, the, founders, of, psycholinguistics, which, links, language, and, cognition, in, the, analysis, of, language, creation, and, usage, his, 1951, book, language, and, communication, is, considered, seminal, in, the, field, his, later, book, the, science, of, words, 1991, also, focused, on, the, psychology, of, language, together, with, noam, chomsky, he, published, papers, on, the, mathematical, and, computational, aspects, of, language, and, its, syntax, two, new, areas, of, study, miller, also, studied, the, human, understanding, of, words, and, sentences, a, problem, also, faced, by, artificial, speech, recognition, technology, the, book, plans, and, the, structure, of, behavior, 1960, written, with, eugene, galanter, and, karl, h, pribram, explored, how, humans, plan, and, act, trying, to, extrapolate, this, to, how, a, robot, could, be, programmed, to, plan, and, act, miller, is, also, known, for, coining, miller, s, law, in, order, to, understand, what, another, person, is, saying, you, must, assume, it, is, true, and, try, to, imagine, what, it, could, be, true, of, miller, authored, several, books, many, considered, the, first, major, works, in, their, respective, fields, miller, s, language, and, communication, was, one, of, the, first, significant, texts, in, the, study, of, language, behavior, the, book, was, a, scientific, study, of, language, emphasizing, quantitative, data, and, was, based, on, the, mathematical, model, of, claude, shannon, s, information, theory, it, used, a, probabilistic, model, imposed, on, a, learning, by, association, scheme, borrowed, from, behaviorism, with, miller, not, yet, attached, to, a, pure, cognitive, perspective, the, first, part, of, the, book, reviewed, information, theory, the, physiology, and, acoustics, of, phonetics, speech, recognition, and, comprehension, and, statistical, techniques, to, analyze, language, the, focus, was, more, on, speech, generation, than, recognition, the, second, part, had, the, psychology, idiosyncratic, differences, across, people, in, language, use, developmental, linguistics, the, structure, of, word, associations, in, people, use, of, symbolism, in, language, and, social, aspects, of, language, use, reviewing, the, book, charles, e, osgood, classified, the, book, as, a, graduate, level, text, based, more, on, objective, facts, than, on, theoretical, constructs, he, thought, the, book, was, verbose, on, some, topics, and, too, brief, on, others, not, directly, related, to, the, author, s, expertise, area, he, was, also, critical, of, miller, s, use, of, simple, skinnerian, single, stage, stimulus, response, learning, to, explain, human, language, acquisition, and, use, this, approach, per, osgood, made, it, impossible, to, analyze, the, concept, of, meaning, and, the, idea, of, language, consisting, of, representational, signs, he, did, find, the, book, objective, in, its, emphasis, on, facts, over, theory, and, depicting, clearly, application, of, information, theory, to, psychology, in, plans, and, the, structure, of, behavior, miller, and, his, co, authors, tried, to, explain, through, an, artificial, intelligence, computational, perspective, how, animals, plan, and, act, this, was, a, radical, break, from, behaviorism, which, explained, behavior, as, a, set, or, sequence, of, stimulus, response, actions, the, authors, introduced, a, planning, element, controlling, such, actions, they, saw, all, plans, as, being, executed, based, on, input, using, a, stored, or, inherited, information, of, the, environment, called, the, image, and, using, a, strategy, called, test, operate, test, exit, tote, the, image, was, essentially, a, stored, memory, of, all, past, context, akin, to, tolman, s, cognitive, map, the, tote, strategy, in, its, initial, test, phase, compared, the, input, against, the, image, if, there, was, incongruity, the, operate, function, attempted, to, reduce, it, this, cycle, would, be, repeated, till, the, incongruity, vanished, and, then, the, exit, function, would, be, invoked, passing, control, to, another, tote, unit, in, a, hierarchically, arranged, scheme, peter, milner, in, a, review, in, the, canadian, journal, of, psychology, noted, the, book, was, short, on, concrete, details, on, implementing, the, tote, strategy, he, also, critically, viewed, the, book, as, not, being, able, to, tie, its, model, to, details, from, neurophysiology, at, a, molecular, level, per, him, the, book, covered, only, the, brain, at, the, gross, level, of, lesion, studies, showing, that, some, of, its, regions, could, possibly, implement, some, tote, strategies, without, giving, a, reader, an, indication, as, to, how, the, region, could, implement, the, strategy, miller, s, 1967, work, the, psychology, of, communication, was, a, collection, of, seven, previously, published, articles, the, first, information, and, memory, dealt, with, chunking, presenting, the, idea, of, separating, physical, length, the, number, of, items, presented, to, be, learned, and, psychological, length, the, number, of, ideas, the, recipient, manages, to, categorize, and, summarize, the, items, with, capacity, of, short, term, memory, was, measured, in, units, of, psychological, length, arguing, against, a, pure, behaviorist, interpretation, since, meaning, of, items, beyond, reinforcement, and, punishment, was, central, to, psychological, length, the, second, essay, was, the, paper, on, magical, number, seven, the, third, the, human, link, in, communication, systems, used, information, theory, and, its, idea, of, channel, capacity, to, analyze, human, perception, bandwidth, the, essay, concluded, how, much, of, what, impinges, on, us, we, can, absorb, as, knowledge, was, limited, for, each, property, of, the, stimulus, to, a, handful, of, items, the, paper, on, psycholinguists, described, how, effort, in, both, speaking, or, understanding, a, sentence, was, related, to, how, much, of, self, reference, to, similar, structures, present, inside, was, there, when, the, sentence, was, broken, down, into, clauses, and, phrases, the, book, in, general, used, the, chomskian, view, of, seeing, language, rules, of, grammar, as, having, a, biological, basis, disproving, the, simple, behaviorist, idea, that, language, performance, improved, with, reinforcement, and, using, the, tools, of, information, and, computation, to, place, hypotheses, on, a, sound, theoretical, framework, and, to, analyze, data, practically, and, efficiently, miller, specifically, addressed, experimental, data, refuting, the, behaviorist, framework, at, concept, level, in, the, field, of, language, and, cognition, he, noted, this, only, qualified, behaviorism, at, the, level, of, cognition, and, did, not, overthrow, it, in, other, spheres, of, psychology, the, cognitive, neuroscience, society, established, a, george, a, miller, prize, in, 1995, for, contributions, to, the, field, the, american, psychological, association, established, a, george, a, miller, award, in, 1995, for, an, outstanding, article, on, general, psychology, from, 1987, the, department, of, psychology, at, princeton, university, has, presented, the, george, a, miller, prize, annually, to, the, best, interdisciplinary, senior, thesis, in, cognitive, science, the, paper, on, the, magical, number, seven, continues, to, be, cited, by, both, the, popular, press, to, explain, the, liking, for, seven, digit, phone, numbers, and, to, argue, against, nine, digit, zip, codes, and, by, academia, especially, modern, psychology, to, highlight, its, break, with, the, behaviorist, paradigm, miller, was, considered, the, 20th, most, eminent, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, in, a, list, republished, by, among, others, the, american, psychological, association
