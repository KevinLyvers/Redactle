normandy, and, burgundy, 13, 16, the, name, is, thought, to, be, dutch, in, origin, and, may, have, derived, from, van, der, walle, de, walle, from, the, rampart, defensive, wall, or, de, waal, the, wall, 42, de, gaulle, s, mother, jeanne, born, maillot, descended, from, a, family, of, wealthy, entrepreneurs, from, lille, she, had, french, irish, scottish, and, german, ancestry, 13, 16, de,

his, mother, s, tales, of, how, she, cried, as, a, child, when, she, heard, of, the, french, capitulation, to, the, germans, at, sedan, in, 1870, he, developed, a, keen, interest, in, military, strategy, he, was, also, influenced, by, his, uncle, also, named, charles, de, gaulle, who, was, a, historian, and, passionate, celticist, who, advocated, the, union, of, the, welsh, scots, irish, and, bretons, into, one, people, his, grandfather, julien, philippe, was, also, a, historian, and, his, grandmother, josephine, marie, wrote, poems, which, impassioned, his, christian, faith, 42, 47, de, gaulle, began, writing, in, his, early, teens, especially, poetry, his, family, paid, for, a, composition, a, one, act, verse, play, to, be, privately, published, a, voracious, reader, he,

fifteen, he, wrote, an, essay, imagining, general, de, gaulle, leading, the, french, army, to, victory, over, germany, in, 1930, he, later, wrote, that, in, his, youth, he, had, looked, forward, with, somewhat, naive, anticipation, to, the, inevitable, future, war, with, germany, to, avenge, the, french, defeat, of, 1870, france, during, de, gaulle, s, adolescence, was, a, divided, society, with, many, developments, which, were, unwelcome, to, the, de, gaulle, family, the, growth, of, socialism, and, syndicalism, the, legal, separation, of, church, and, state, in, 1905, and, the, reduction, in, the, term, of, military, service, to, two, years, equally, unwelcome, were, the, entente, cordiale, with, britain, the, first, moroccan, crisis, and, above, all, the, dreyfus, affair, henri, de, gaulle, came, to, be, a, supporter, of, dreyfus, but, was, less, concerned, with, his, innocence, per, se, than, with, the, disgrace, which, the, army, had, brought, onto, itself, the, period, also, saw, a, resurgence, in, evangelical, catholicism, the, dedication, of, the, sacr, c, ur, paris, and, the, rise, of, the, cult, of, joan, of, arc, 50, 51, de, gaulle, was, not, an, outstanding, pupil, until, his, mid, teens, but, from, july, 1906, he, focused, on, winning, a, place, at, the, military, academy, saint, cyr, lacouture, suggests, that, de, gaulle, joined, the, army, despite, being, more, suited, to, a, career, as, a, writer, and, historian, partly, to, please, his, father, and, partly, because, it, was, one, of, the, few, unifying, forces, which, represented, the, whole, of, french, society, he, later, wrote, that, when, i, entered, the, army, it, was, one, of, the, greatest, things, in, the, world, 51, a, claim, which, lacouture, points, out, needs, to, be, treated, with, caution, the, army, s, reputation, was, at, a, low, it, was, used, extensively, for, strike, breaking, and, there, were, fewer, than, 700, applicants, for, saint, cyr, in, 1908, down, from, 2, 000, at, the, turn, of, the, century, de, gaulle, won, a, place, at, saint, cyr, in, 1909, his, class, ranking, was, mediocre, 119th, out, of, 221, under, a, law, of, 21, march, 1905, aspiring, army, officers, were, required, to, serve, a, year, in, the, ranks, including, time, as, a, private, and, as, an, nco, before, attending, the, academy, accordingly, in, october, 1909, de, gaulle, enlisted, for, four, years, as, required, rather, than, the, normal, two, year, term, for, conscripts, in, the, 33rd, infantry, regiment, of, the, french, army, based, at, arras, this, was, a, historic, regiment, with, austerlitz, wagram, and, borodino, amongst, its, battle, honours, in, april, 1910, he, was, promoted, to, corporal, his, company, commander, declined, to, promote, him, to, sergeant, the, usual, rank, for, a, potential, officer, commenting, that, the, young, man, clearly, felt, that, nothing, less, than, constable, of, france, would, be, good, enough, for, him, he, was, eventually, promoted, to, sergeant, in, september, 1910, de, gaulle, took, up, his, place, at, saint, cyr, in, october, 1910, by, the, end, of, his, first, year, he, had, risen, to, 45th, place, he, was, nicknamed, the, great, asparagus, because, of, his, height, 196, cm, 6, 5, high, forehead, and, nose, 301, he, did, well, at, the, academy, and, received, praise, for, his, conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military, spirit, and, resistance, to, fatigue, in, 1912, he, graduated, 13th, in, his, class, and, his, passing, out, report, noted, that, he, was, a, gifted, cadet, who, would, undoubtedly, make, an, excellent, officer, the, future, marshal, alphonse, juin, was, first, in, the, class, although, the, two, do, not, appear, to, have, been, close, at, the, time, preferring, to, serve, in, france, rather, than, the, overseas, colonies, in, october, 1912, he, rejoined, the, 33rd, infantry, regiment, as, a, second, lieutenant, the, regiment, was, now, commanded, by, colonel, and, future, marshal, philippe, p, tain, whom, de, gaulle, would, follow, for, the, next, 15, years, he, later, wrote, in, his, memoirs, my, first, colonel, p, tain, taught, me, the, art, of, command, it, has, been, claimed, that, in, the, build, up, to, world, war, i, de, gaulle, agreed, with, p, tain, about, the, obsolescence, of, cavalry, and, of, traditional, tactics, and, often, debated, great, battles, and, the, likely, outcome, of, any, coming, war, with, his, superior, lacouture, is, sceptical, pointing, out, that, although, p, tain, wrote, glowing, appraisals, of, de, gaulle, in, 1913, it, is, unlikely, that, he, stood, out, among, the, 19, captains, and, 32, lieutenants, under, his, command, de, gaulle, would, have, been, present, at, the, 1913, arras, manoeuvres, at, which, p, tain, criticised, general, gallet, to, his, face, but, there, is, no, evidence, in, his, notebooks, that, he, accepted, p, tain, s, unfashionable, ideas, about, the, importance, of, firepower, against, the, dominant, doctrine, emphasizing, offensive, spirit, de, gaulle, stressed, how, maurice, de, saxe, had, banned, volley, fire, how, french, armies, of, the, napoleonic, period, had, relied, on, infantry, column, attack, and, how, french, military, power, had, declined, in, the, nineteenth, century, because, of, supposedly, excessive, concentration, on, firepower, rather, than, lan, he, also, appears, to, have, accepted, the, then, fashionable, lesson, drawn, from, the, recent, russo, japanese, war, of, how, bayonet, charges, by, japanese, infantry, with, high, morale, had, succeeded, in, the, face, of, enemy, firepower, de, gaulle, was, promoted, to, first, lieutenant, in, october, 1913, when, war, broke, out, in, france, in, early, august, 1914, the, 33rd, regiment, considered, one, of, the, best, fighting, units, in, france, was, immediately, thrown, into, checking, the, german, advance, at, dinant, however, the, french, fifth, army, commander, general, charles, lanrezac, remained, wedded, to, 19th, century, battle, tactics, throwing, his, units, into, pointless, bayonet, charges, against, german, artillery, incurring, heavy, losses, as, a, platoon, commander, de, gaulle, was, involved, in, fierce, fighting, from, the, outset, he, received, his, baptism, of, fire, on, 15, august, and, was, among, the, first, to, be, wounded, receiving, a, bullet, in, the, knee, at, the, battle, of, dinant, 58, it, is, sometimes, claimed, that, in, hospital, he, grew, bitter, at, the, tactics, used, and, spoke, with, other, injured, officers, against, the, outdated, methods, of, the, french, army, however, there, is, no, contemporary, evidence, that, he, understood, the, importance, of, artillery, in, modern, warfare, instead, in, his, writing, at, the, time, he, criticised, the, overrapid, offensive, the, inadequacy, of, french, generals, and, the, slowness, of, the, english, troops, he, rejoined, his, regiment, in, october, as, commander, of, the, 7th, company, many, of, his, former, comrades, were, already, dead, in, december, he, became, regimental, adjutant, de, gaulle, s, unit, gained, recognition, for, repeatedly, crawling, out, into, no, man, s, land, to, listen, to, the, conversations, of, the, enemy, and, the, information, brought, back, was, so, valuable, that, on, 18, january, 1915, he, received, the, croix, de, guerre, on, 10, february, he, was, promoted, to, captain, initially, on, probation, on, 10, march, 1915, de, gaulle, was, shot, in, the, left, hand, a, wound, which, initially, seemed, trivial, but, became, infected, the, wound, incapacitated, him, for, four, months, and, later, forced, him, to, wear, his, wedding, ring, on, the, right, hand, 61, in, august, he, commanded, the, 10th, company, before, returning, to, duty, as, regimental, adjutant, on, 3, september, 1915, his, rank, of, captain, became, permanent, in, late, october, he, returned, to, command, of, 10th,

surrounded, he, received, a, bayonet, wound, to, the, left, thigh, after, being, stunned, by, a, shell, and, was, captured, after, passing, out, from, the, effects, of, poison, gas, he, was, one, of, the, few, survivors, of, his, battalion, 63, the, circumstances, of, his, capture, would, later, become, a, subject, of, debate, as, anti, gaullists, spread, rumour, that, he, had, actually, surrendered, a, claim, de, gaulle, nonchalantly, dismissed, de, gaulle, spent, 32, months, in, six, different, prisoner, camps, but, he, spent, most, time, in, the, ingolstadt, fortress, 40, where,

him, a, glowing, reference, recommending, him, for, high, command, in, the, spring, of, 1931, as, his, posting, in, beirut, drew, to, a, close, de, gaulle, once, again, asked, p, tain, for, a, posting, to, the, cole, de, guerre, p, tain, tried, to, obtain, an, appointment, for, him, as, professor, of, history, there, but, once, again, the, faculty, would, not, have, him, instead, de, gaulle, drawing, on, plans, he, had, drawn, up, in, 1928, for, reform, of, that, institution, asked, p, tain, to, create, a, special, post, for, him, which, would, enable, him, to, lecture, on, the, conduct, of, war, both, to, the, cole, de, guerre, and, to, the, centre, des, hautes, tudes, militaires, chem, a, senior, staff, college, for, generals, known, as, the, school, for, marshals, to, civilians, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, and, to, civil, servants, p, tain, instead, advised, him, to, apply, for, a, posting, to, the, secr, tariat, g, n, ral, du, conseil, sup, rieur, de, la, d, fense, nationale, sgdn, general, secretariat, of, the, supreme, war, council, in, paris, p, tain, promised, to, lobby, for, the, appointment, which, he, thought, would, be, good, experience, for, him, de, gaulle, was, posted, to, sgdn, in, november, 1931, initially, as, a, drafting, officer, 94, he, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, colonel, in, december, 1932, and, appointed, head, of, the, third, section, operations, his, service, at, sgdn, gave, him, six, years, experience, of, the, interface, between, army, planning, and, government, enabling, him, to, take, on, ministerial, responsibilities, in, 1940, 97, after, studying, arrangements, in, the, us, italy, and, belgium, de, gaulle, drafted, a, bill, for, the, organisation, of, the, country, in, wartime, he, made, a, presentation, about, his, bill, to, the, chem, the, bill, passed, the, chamber, of, deputies, but, failed, in, the, senate, unlike, p, tain, de, gaulle, believed, in, the, use, of, tanks, and, rapid, maneuvers, rather, than, trench, warfare, 108, de, gaulle, became, a, disciple, of, mile, mayer, a, retired, lieutenant, colonel, his, career, had, been, damaged, by, the, dreyfus, affair, and, military, thinker, mayer, thought, that, although, wars, were, still, bound, to, happen, it, was, obsolete, for, civilised, countries, to, threaten, or, wage, war, on, one, another, he, had, a, low, opinion, of, french, generals, and, was, a, critic, of, the, maginot, line, and, a, proponent, of, mechanised, warfare, lacouture, suggests, that, mayer, focused, de, gaulle, s, thoughts, away, from, his, obsession, with, the, mystique, of, the, strong, leader, le, fil, d, ep, e, 1932, and, back, to, loyalty, to, republican, institutions, and, military, reform, in, 1934, de, gaulle, wrote, vers, l, arm, e, de, m, tier, towards, a, professional, army, he, proposed, mechanization, of, the, infantry, with, stress, on, an, lite, force, of, 100, 000, men, and, 3, 000, tanks, the, book, imagined, tanks, driving, around, the, country, like, cavalry, de, gaulle, s, mentor, emile, mayer, was, somewhat, more, prophetic, than, he, was, about, the, future, importance, of, air, power, on, the, battlefield, such, an, army, would, both, compensate, for, france, s, population, shortage, and, be, an, efficient, tool, to, enforce, international, law, particularly, the, treaty, of, versailles, he, also, thought, it, would, be, a, precursor, to, a, deeper, national, reorganisation, and, wrote, that, a, master, has, to, make, his, appearance, whose, orders, cannot, be, challenged, a, man, upheld, by, public, opinion, only, 700, copies, were, sold, in, france, the, claim, that, thousands, of, copies, were, sold, in, germany, is, thought, to, be, an, exaggeration, de, gaulle, used, the, book, to, widen, his, contacts, among, journalists, notably, with, andr, pironneau, editor, of, l, cho, de, paris, the, book, attracted, praise, across, the, political, spectrum, apart, from, the, hard, left, who, were, committed, to, the, republican, ideal, of, a, citizen, army, de, gaulle, s, views, attracted, the, attention, of, the, maverick, politician, paul, reynaud, to, whom, he, wrote, frequently, sometimes, in, obsequious, terms, reynaud, first, invited, him, to, meet, him, on, 5, december, 1934, de, gaulle, was, deeply, focused, on, his, career, at, this, time, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, was, tempted, by, fascism, and, there, is, little, evidence, of, his, views, either, on, domestic, upheavals, in, 1934, and, 1936, or, the, many, foreign, policy, crises, of, the, decade, he, approved, of, the, rearmament, drive, which, the, popular, front, government, began, in, 1936, although, french, military, doctrine, remained, that, tanks, should, be, used, in, penny, packets, for, infantry, support, ironically, in, 1940, it, would, be, german, panzer, units, that, would, be, used, in, a, manner, similar, to, what, de, gaulle, had, advocated, a, rare, insight, into, de, gaulle, s, political, views, is, a, letter, to, his, mother, warning, that, war, with, germany, was, inevitable, and, reassuring, her, that, pierre, laval, s, pact, with, the, ussr, in, 1935, was, for, the, best, likening, it, to, francis, i, s, alliance, with, the, turks, against, emperor, charles, v, from, april, 1936, whilst, still, in, his, staff, position, at, sgdn, de, gaulle, was, a, lecturer, to, generals, at, chem, de, gaulle, s, superiors, disapproved, of, his, views, about, tanks, and, he, was, passed, over, for, promotion, to, full, colonel, in, 1936, supposedly, because, his, service, record, was, not, good, enough, he, called, on, his, political, patron, reynaud, who, showed, his, record, to, minister, of, war, douard, daladier, daladier, who, was, an, enthusiast, for, rearmament, with, modern, weapons, ensured, that, his, name, was, on, the, promotion, list, for, the, following, year, 109, in, 1937, general, bineau, who, had, taught, him, at, saint, cyr, wrote, on, his, report, on, his, lectureship, at, chem, that, he, was, highly, able, and, suitable, for, high, command, in, the, future, but, that, he, hid, his, attributes, under, a, cold, and, lofty, attitude, he, was, put, in, command, of, the, 507th, tank, regiment, a, battalion, of, medium, char, d2s, and, a, battalion, of, r35, light, tanks, at, metz, on, 13, july, 1937, and, his, promotion, to, full, colonel, took, effect, on, 24, december, that, year, de, gaulle, attracted, public, attention, by, leading, a, parade, of, 80, tanks, into, the, place, d, armes, at, metz, in, his, command, tank, austerlitz, by, now, de, gaulle, was, becoming, a, well, known, figure, known, as, colonel, motor, s, 117, at, the, invitation, of, the, publisher, plon, he, produced, another, book, la, france, et, son, arm, e, france, and, her, army, in, 1938, de, gaulle, incorporated, much, of, the, text, he, had, written, for, p, tain, a, decade, earlier, for, the, uncompleted, book, le, soldat, to, p, tain, s, displeasure, de, gaulle, agreed, to, include, a, dedication, to, p, tain, although, he, wrote, his, own, rather, than, using, the, draft, p, tain, sent, him, which, was, dropped, from, postwar, editions, until, 1938, p, tain, had, treated, de, gaulle, as, lacouture, puts, it, with, unbounded, good, will, but, by, october, 1938, he, privately, thought, his, former, prot, g, an, ambitious, man, and, very, ill, bred, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, de, gaulle, was, put, in, command, of, the, french, fifth, army, s, tanks, five, scattered, battalions, largely, equipped, with, r35, light, tanks, in, alsace, on, 12, september, 1939, he, attacked, at, bitche, simultaneously, with, the, saar, offensive, 118, at, the, start, of, october, 1939, reynaud, asked, for, a, staff, posting, under, de, gaulle, but, remained, at, his, post, as, minister, of, finance, de, gaulle, s, tanks, were, inspected, by, president, lebrun, who, was, impressed, but, regretted, that, it, was, too, late, to, implement, his, ideas, he, wrote, a, paper, l, av, nement, de, la, force, m, canique, the, coming, of, the, armoured, force, which, he, sent, to, general, georges, commander, in, chief, on, the, northeast, front, who, was, not, especially, impressed, and, the, politician, leon, blum, daladier, prime, minister, at, the, time, was, too, busy, to, read, it, in, late, february, 1940, reynaud, told, de, gaulle, that, he, had, been, earmarked, for, command, of, an, armoured, division, as, soon, as, one, became, available, early, in, 1940, the, exact, date, is, uncertain, de, gaulle, proposed, to, reynaud, that, he, be, appointed, secretary, general, of, the, war, council, which, would, in, effect, make, him, the, government, s, military, adviser, when, reynaud, became, prime, minister, in, march, he, was, reliant, on, daladier, s, backing, so, the, job, went, instead, to, the, politician, paul, baudouin, in, late, march, reynaud, told, de, gaulle, that, he, would, be, given, command, of, the, 4th, armoured, division, due, to, form, by, 15, may, the, government, appeared, likely, to, be, restructured, as, daladier, and, maurice, gamelin, commander, in, chief, were, under, attack, in, the, aftermath, of, the, allied, defeat, in, norway, and, had, this, happened, de, gaulle, who, on, 3, may, was, still, lobbying, reynaud, for, a, restructuring, of, the, control, of, the, war, might, well, have, joined, the, government, by, 7, may, he, was, assembling, the, staff, of, his, new, division, the, germans, attacked, the, west, on, 10, may, de, gaulle, activated, his, new, division, on, 12, may, the, germans, broke, through, at, sedan, on, 15, may, 1940, that, day, with, three, tank, battalions, assembled, less, than, a, third, of, his, paper, strength, he, was, summoned, to, headquarters, and, told, to, attack, to, gain, time, for, general, robert, touchon, s, sixth, army, to, redeploy, from, the, maginot, line, to, the, aisne, general, georges, told, him, it, was, his, chance, to, implement, his, ideas, the, attack, at, montcornet, a, key, road, junction, near, laon, began, around, 04, 30, on, 17, may, outnumbered, and, without, air, support, he, lost, 23, of, his, 90, vehicles, to, mines, anti, tank, weapons, and, stukas, on, 18, may, he, was, reinforced, by, two, fresh, regiments, of, armoured, cavalry, bringing, his, strength, to, 150, vehicles, he, attacked, again, on, 19, may, and, his, forces, were, once, again, devastated, he, ignored, orders, from, general, georges, to, withdraw, and, in, the, early, afternoon, demanded, two, more, divisions, from, touchon, who, refused, although, de, gaulle, s, tanks, forced, german, infantry, to, retreat, to, caumont, the, action, brought, only, temporary, relief, and, did, little, to, slow, the, spearhead, of, the, german, advance, nevertheless, it, was, one, of, the, few, successes, the, french, enjoyed, while, suffering, defeats, across, the, country, de, gaulle, s, rank, of, brigadier, general, became, effective, on, 1, june, 1940, 127, that, day, he, was, in, paris, after, visiting, his, tailor, to, be, fitted, for, his, general, s, uniform, he, met, reynaud, who, appears, to, have, offered, him, a, government, job, for, the, first, time, and, afterwards, the, commander, in, chief, maxime, weygand, who, congratulated, him, on, saving, france, s, honour, and, asked, for, his, advice, on, 2, june, he, sent, a, memo, to, weygand, vainly, urging, that, the, french, armoured, divisions, be, consolidated, from, four, weak, divisions, into, three, stronger, ones, and, concentrated, into, an, armoured, corps, under, his, command, he, made, the, same, suggestion, to, reynaud, on, 5, june, the, day, the, germans, began, the, second, phase, of, their, offensive, fall, rot, prime, minister, paul, reynaud, appointed, de, gaulle, under, secretary, of, state, for, national, defence, and, war, with, particular, responsibility, for, coordination, with, the, british, weygand, objected, to, the, appointment, thinking, him, a, mere, child, p, tain, deputy, prime, minister, was, also, displeased, and, told, reynaud, the, story, of, the, ghost, writing, of, le, soldat, his, appointment, received, a, good, deal, of, press, attention, both, in, france, and, in, the, uk, he, asked, for, an, english, speaking, aide, and, geoffroy, chodron, de, courcel, was, given, the, job, on, 8, june, de, gaulle, visited, weygand, who, believed, it, was, the, end, and, that, after, france, was, defeated, britain, would, soon, sue, for, peace, a, day, later, de, gaulle, flew, to, london, and, met, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, for, the, first, time, it, was, thought, that, half, a, million, men, could, be, evacuated, to, french, north, africa, provided, the, british, and, french, navies, and, air, forces, coordinated, their, efforts, either, at, this, meeting, or, on, 16, june, he, urged, churchill, in, vain, to, throw, more, royal, air, force, raf, aircraft, into, the, battle, of, france, but, conceded, that, churchill, was, right, to, refuse, on, 11, june, de, gaulle, drove, to, arcis, sur, aube, and, offered, general, charles, huntziger, weygand, s, job, as, commander, in, chief, huntziger, accepted, in, principle, but, de, gaulle, was, unable, to, persuade, reynaud, to, sack, weygand, on, 13, june, de, gaulle, attended, another, anglo, french, conference, at, tours, with, churchill, lord, halifax, lord, beaverbrook, edward, spears, baron, ismay, and, alexander, cadogan, de, gaulle, was, dissuaded, from, resigning, by, the, interior, minister, georges, mandel, who, argued, that, the, war, was, just, beginning, and, that, de, gaulle, needed, to, keep, his, reputation, unsullied, nevertheless, at, around, 9, 00, on, 17, june, de, gaulle, flew, to, london, on, a, british, aircraft, with, spears, de, gaulle, later, told, andr, malraux, of, the, mental, anguish, which, his, flight, to, london, a, break, with, the, french, army, and, with, the, recognised, government, which, would, inevitably, be, seen, as, treason, by, many, had, caused, him, de, gaulle, landed, at, heston, airport, soon, after, 12, 30, on, 17, june, 1940, he, saw, churchill, at, around, 15, 00, and, churchill, offered, him, broadcast, time, on, bbc, they, both, knew, about, p, tain, s, broadcast, earlier, that, day, that, stated, that, the, fighting, must, end, and, that, he, had, approached, the, germans, for, terms, that, evening, de, gaulle, dined, with, jean, monnet, and, denounced, p, tain, s, treason, 125, 128, the, next, day, the, british, cabinet, churchill, was, not, present, as, it, was, the, day, of, his, finest, hour, speech, were, reluctant, to, agree, to, de, gaulle, giving, a, radio, address, as, britain, was, still, in, communication, with, the, p, tain, government, about, the, fate, of, the, french, fleet, duff, cooper, minister, of, information, had, an, advance, copy, of, the, address, to, which, there, were, no, objections, the, cabinet, eventually, agreed, after, individual, lobbying, as, indicated, by, a, handwritten, amendment, to, the, cabinet, minutes, de, gaulle, s, appeal, of, 18, june, exhorted, the, french, people, not, to, be, demoralized, and, to, continue, to, resist, occupation, he, also, apparently, on, his, own, initiative, declared, that, he, would, broadcast, again, the, next, day, few, listened, to, the, 18, june, speech, 4, 6, the, speech, was, published, in, some, newspapers, in, mainland, france, it, was, largely, aimed, at, french, soldiers, who, were, in, britain, after, being, evacuated, from, norway, and, dunkirk, most, showed, no, interest, in, fighting, for, de, gaulle, s, free, french, forces, and, were, repatriated, to, france, to, become, german, prisoners, of, war, the, small, audience, of, the, 18, june, appeal, grew, for, later, speeches, 5, 6, and, the, press, by, early, august, described, free, french, military, as, fighting, under, de, gaulle, s, command, although, few, in, france, knew, anything, about, him, 5, 6, the, vichy, regime, had, already, sentenced, de, gaulle, to, four, years, imprisonment, on, 2, august, 1940, he, was, condemned, to, death, by, court, martial, in, absentia, although, p, tain, commented, that, he, would, ensure, that, the, sentence, was, never, carried, out, de, gaulle, said, of, the, sentence, i, consider, the, act, of, the, vichy, men, as, void, i, shall, have, an, explanation, with, them, after, the, victory, he, and, churchill, reached, agreement, on, 7, august, 1940, that, britain, would, fund, the, free, french, with, the, bill, to, be, settled, after, the, war, the, financial, agreement, was, finalised, in, march, 1941, a, separate, letter, guaranteed, the, territorial, integrity, of, the, french, empire, de, gaulle, s, support, grew, out, of, a, base, in, the, colonial, french, equatorial, africa, in, the, autumn, of, 1940, the, colonial, empire, largely, supported, the, vichy, regime, f, lix, bou, governor, of, chad, switched, his, support, to, general, de, gaulle, in, september, encouraged, de, gaulle, traveled, to, brazzaville, in, october, where, he, announced, the, formation, of, an, empire, defense, council, in, his, brazzaville, manifesto, and, invited, all, colonies, still, supporting, vichy, to, join, him, and, the, free, french, forces, in, the, fight, against, germany, which, most, of, them, did, by, 1943, working, with, the, french, resistance, and, other, supporters, in, france, s, colonial, african, possessions, after, operation, torch, in, november, 1942, de, gaulle, moved, his, headquarters, to, algiers, in, may, 1943, he, became, first, joint, head, with, the, less, resolutely, independent, general, henri, giraud, the, candidate, preferred, by, the, us, who, wrongly, suspected, de, gaulle, of, being, a, british, puppet, and, then, after, squeezing, out, giraud, by, force, of, personality, sole, chairman, of, the, french, committee, of, national, liberation, de, gaulle, was, held, in, high, regard, by, allied, commander, general, dwight, eisenhower, in, algiers, in, 1943, eisenhower, gave, de, gaulle, the, assurance, in, person, that, a, french, force, would, liberate, paris, and, arranged, that, the, army, division, of, french, general, philippe, leclerc, de, hauteclocque, would, be, transferred, from, north, africa, to, the, uk, to, carry, out, that, liberation, eisenhower, was, impressed, by, the, combativeness, of, units, of, the, free, french, forces, and, grateful, for, the, part, they, had, played, in, mopping, up, the, remnants, of, german, resistance, he, also, detected, how, strongly, devoted, many, were, to, de, gaulle, and, how, ready, they, were, to, accept, him, as, the, national, leader, as, preparations, for, the, liberation, of, europe, gathered, pace, the, us, in, particular, found, de, gaulle, s, tendency, to, view, everything, from, the, french, perspective, to, be, extremely, tiresome, president, roosevelt, who, refused, to, recognize, any, provisional, authority, in, france, until, elections, had, been, held, referred, to, de, gaulle, as, an, apprentice, dictator, a, view, backed, by, a, number, of, leading, frenchmen, in, washington, including, jean, monnet, who, later, became, instrumental, in, setting, up, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, that, led, to, the, modern, european, union, roosevelt, directed, churchill, not, to, provide, de, gaulle, with, strategic, details, of, the, imminent, invasion, because, he, did, not, trust, him, to, keep, the, information, to, himself, french, codes, were, considered, weak, posing, a, risk, since, the, free, french, refused, to, use, british, or, american, codes, de, gaulle, refused, to, share, coded, information, with, the, british, who, were, then, obliged, secretly, to, break, the, codes, to, read, french, messages, upon, his, arrival, at, raf, northolt, on, 4, june, 1944, he, received, an, official, welcome, later, on, his, personal, train, churchill, informed, him, that, he, wanted, him, to, make, a, radio, address, but, when, informed, that, the, americans, continued, to, refuse, to, recognise, his, right, to, power, in, france, and, after, churchill, suggested, he, request, a, meeting, with, roosevelt, to, improve, his, relationship, with, the, president, de, gaulle, became, angry, demanding, to, know, why, he, should, lodge, my, candidacy, for, power, in, france, with, roosevelt, the, french, government, exists, on, 14, june, 1944, he, left, britain, for, the, city, of, bayeux, normandy, which, he, proclaimed, as, the, capital, of, free, france, appointing, his, aide, de, camp, francois, coulet, as, head, of, the, civil, administration, de, gaulle, returned, to, the, uk, that, same, night, on, a, french, destroyer, and, although, the, official, position, of, the, supreme, military, command, remained, unchanged, local, allied, officers, found, it, more, practical, to, deal, with, the, fledgling, administration, in, bayeux, in, everyday, matters, de, gaulle, flew, to, algiers, on, 16, june, and, then, went, to, rome, to, meet, the, pope, and, the, new, italian, government, at, the, beginning, of, july, he, visited, roosevelt, in, washington, where, he, received, the, 17, gun, salute, of, a, senior, military, leader, rather, than, the, 21, guns, of, a, visiting, head, of, state, de, gaulle, successfully, lobbied, for, paris, to, be, made, a, priority, for, liberation, on, humanitarian, grounds, and, obtained, from, allied, supreme, commander, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, an, agreement, that, french, troops, would, be, allowed, to, enter, the, capital, first, a, few, days, later, general, leclerc, s, division, entered, the, outskirts, of, the, city, and, after, six, days, of, fighting, in, which, the, resistance, played, a, major, part, the, german, garrison, of, 5000, men, surrendered, on, 25, august, although, some, sporadic, fighting, continued, for, several, days, on, the, evening, of, 26, august, the, wehrmacht, launched, a, massive, aerial, and, artillery, barrage, of, paris, in, revenge, leaving, several, thousand, dead, or, injured, the, situation, in, paris, remained, tense, and, a, few, days, later, de, gaulle, asked, general, eisenhower, to, send, american, troops, into, paris, as, a, show, of, strength, on, 29, august, the, us, 28th, infantry, division, was, rerouted, from, its, journey, to, the, front, line, and, paraded, down, the, champs, elysees, the, same, day, washington, and, london, agreed, to, accept, the, position, of, the, free, french, the, following, day, general, eisenhower, gave, his, de, facto, blessing, with, a, visit, to, the, general, in, paris, roosevelt, insisted, that, an, allied, military, government, for, occupied, territories, amgot, should, be, implemented, in, france, but, this, was, opposed, by, both, the, secretary, and, under, secretary, of, war, as, well, as, by, eisenhower, who, had, been, strongly, opposed, to, the, imposition, of, amgot, in, north, africa, eisenhower, unlike, roosevelt, wanted, to, cooperate, with, de, gaulle, and, he, secured, a, last, minute, promise, from, the, president, on, the, eve, of, d, day, that, the, allied, officers, would, not, act, as, military, governors, and, would, instead, cooperate, with, the, local, authorities, as, the, allied, forces, liberated, french, territory, de, gaulle, would, later, claim, in, his, memoirs, that, he, blocked, amgot, with, the, prewar, parties, and, most, of, their, leaders, discredited, there, was, little, opposition, to, de, gaulle, and, his, associates, forming, an, interim, administration, in, order, not, to, be, seen, as, presuming, on, his, position, in, such, austere, times, de, gaulle, did, not, use, one, of, the, grand, official, residences, such, as, hotel, de, matignon, or, the, lys, e, palace, but, resided, briefly, in, his, old, office, at, the, ministry, of, war, when, he, was, joined, by, his, wife, and, daughters, they, moved, into, a, small, state, owned, villa, on, edge, of, bois, de, boulogne, which, had, once, been, set, aside, for, hermann, g, ring, on, 10, november, 1944, churchill, flew, to, paris, to, a, reception, by, de, gaulle, and, the, two, together, were, greeted, by, thousands, of, cheering, parisians, on, the, next, day, harold, nicolson, stated, that, anthony, eden, told, him, that, not, for, one, moment, did, winston, stop, crying, and, that, he, could, have, filled, buckets, by, the, time, he, received, the, freedom, of, paris, at, an, official, luncheon, de, gaulle, said, it, is, true, that, we, would, not, have, seen, if, our, old, and, gallant, ally, england, and, all, the, british, dominions, under, precisely, the, impulsion, and, inspiration, of, those, we, are, honouring, today, had, not, deployed, the, extraordinary, determination, to, win, and, that, magnificent, courage, which, saved, the, freedom, of, the, world, there, is, no, french, man, or, woman, who, is, not, touched, to, the, depths, of, their, hearts, and, souls, by, this, keenly, aware, of, the, need, to, seize, the, initiative, and, get, the, process, under, firm, judicial, control, de, gaulle, appointed, justice, minister, fran, ois, de, menthon, to, lead, the, legal, purge, puration, l, gale, to, punish, traitors, and, clear, away, traces, of, the, vichy, regime, knowing, that, he, would, need, to, reprieve, many, of, the, economic, collaborators, such, as, police, and, civil, servants, who, held, minor, roles, under, vichy, to, keep, the, country, running, he, assumed, as, head, of, state, the, right, to, commute, death, sentences, of, the, near, 2, 000, people, who, received, the, death, sentence, from, the, courts, fewer, than, 800, were, executed, de, gaulle, commuted, 998, of, the, 1, 554, capital, sentences, submitted, before, him, including, all, women, many, others, were, given, jail, terms, or, had, their, voting, rights, and, other, legal, privileges, taken, away, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, purges, were, conducted, arbitrarily, with, often, absurdly, severe, or, overly, lenient, punishments, being, handed, down, less, well, off, people, who, were, unable, to, pay, for, lawyers, were, more, harshly, treated, as, time, went, by, and, feelings, grew, less, intense, a, number, of, people, who, had, held, fairly, senior, positions, under, the, vichy, government, such, as, maurice, papon, and, ren, bousquet, escaped, consequences, by, claiming, to, have, worked, secretly, for, the, resistance, or, to, have, played, a, double, game, working, for, the, good, of, france, by, serving, the, established, order, p, tain, received, a, death, sentence, which, his, old, prot, g, de, gaulle, commuted, to, life, imprisonment, while, maxime, weygand, was, eventually, acquitted, there, was, a, widespread, belief, particularly, in, the, years, that, followed, that, de, gaulle, was, trying, to, appease, both, the, third, republic, politicians, and, the, former, vichy, leaders, who, had, made, laval, their, scapegoat, de, gaulle, was, never, invited, to, the, summit, conferences, of, allied, leaders, such, as, yalta, and, potsdam, he, never, forgave, the, big, three, leaders, churchill, roosevelt, and, stalin, for, their, neglect, and, continued, to, rage, against, it, as, having, been, a, negative, factor, in, european, politics, for, the, rest, of, his, life, after, the, rhine, crossings, the, french, first, army, captured, a, large, section, of, territory, in, southern, germany, but, although, this, later, allowed, france, to, play, a, part, in, the, signing, of, the, german, surrender, roosevelt, in, particular, refused, to, allow, any, discussion, about, de, gaulle, participating, in, the, big, three, conferences, that, would, shape, europe, in, the, post, war, world, churchill, pressed, hard, for, france, to, be, included, at, the, inter, allied, table, but, on, 6, december, 1944, the, american, president, wired, both, stalin, and, churchill, to, say, that, de, gaulle, s, presence, would, merely, introduce, a, complicating, and, undesirable, factor, at, the, yalta, conference, in, february, 1945, despite, stalin, s, opposition, churchill, and, roosevelt, insisted, that, france, be, allowed, a, post, war, occupation, zone, in, germany, and, also, made, sure, that, it, was, included, among, the, five, nations, that, invited, others, to, the, conference, to, establish, the, united, nations, this, guaranteed, france, a, permanent, seat, on, the, un, security, council, in, may, 1945, the, german, armies, surrendered, to, the, americans, and, british, at, rheims, and, a, separate, armistice, was, signed, with, france, in, berlin, de, gaulle, refused, to, allow, any, british, participation, in, the, victory, parade, in, paris, however, among, the, vehicles, that, took, part, was, an, ambulance, from, the, hadfield, spears, ambulance, unit, staffed, by, french, doctors, and, british, nurses, one, of, the, nurses, was, mary, spears, who, had, set, up, the, unit, and, had, worked, almost, continuously, since, the, battle, of, france, with, free, french, forces, in, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, italy, mary, s, husband, was, general, edward, spears, the, british, liaison, to, the, free, french, who, had, personally, spirited, de, gaulle, to, safety, in, britain, in, 1940, when, de, gaulle, saw, the, union, flags, and, tricolours, side, by, side, on, the, ambulance, and, heard, french, soldiers, cheering, voil, spears, vive, spears, he, ordered, that, the, unit, be, closed, down, immediately, and, its, british, staff, sent, home, a, number, of, french, troops, returned, their, medals, in, protest, and, mary, wrote, it, is, a, pitiful, business, when, a, great, man, suddenly, becomes, small, another, confrontation, with, the, americans, broke, out, soon, after, the, armistice, when, the, french, sent, troops, to, occupy, the, french, speaking, italian, border, region, of, val, d, aoste, the, french, commander, threatened, to, fire, on, american, troops, if, they, tried, to, stop, them, and, an, irate, truman, ordered, the, immediate, end, to, all, arms, shipments, to, france, truman, sent, de, gaulle, an, angry, letter, saying, that, he, found, it, unbelievable, that, the, french, could, threaten, to, attack, american, troops, after, they, had, done, so, much, to, liberate, france, within, the, same, month, another, crisis, developed, in, syria, where, french, troops, tried, to, quell, nationalist, protests, at, the, continued, occupation, of, the, levant, winston, churchill, opposed, french, action, and, after, they, refused, to, negotiate, he, ordered, british, forces, into, syria, from, transjordan, with, orders, to, fire, on, the, french, if, necessary, known, as, the, levant, crisis, british, forces, swept, into, syria, forcing, the, french, to, stand, down, and, with, political, pressure, added, by, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, the, french, ordered, a, ceasefire, this, crisis, further, infuriated, truman, and, france, evacuated, its, troops, later, in, the, year, but, de, gaulle, said, to, the, british, ambassador, duff, cooper, you, have, betrayed, france, and, betrayed, the, west, that, cannot, be, forgotten, 47, de, gaulle, was, generally, well, received, in, the, united, states, immediately, after, world, war, ii, and, supported, the, us, in, public, comments, he, visited, new, york, city, on, 27, august, 1945, to, great, welcome, by, thousands, of, people, of, the, city, and, its, mayor, fiorello, la, guardia, on, that, day, de, gaulle, wished, long, live, the, united, states, of, america, he, visited, new, york, city, hall, and, idlewild, airport, now, john, f, kennedy, international, airport, and, presented, laguardia, with, the, grand, croix, of, the, legion, of, honour, award, since, the, liberation, the, only, parliament, in, france, had, been, an, enlarged, version, of, the, algiers, provisional, consultative, assembly, and, at, last, in, october, 1945, elections, were, held, for, a, new, constituent, assembly, whose, main, task, was, to, provide, a, new, constitution, for, the, fourth, republic, de, gaulle, favoured, a, strong, executive, for, the, nation, but, all, three, of, the, main, parties, wished, to, severely, restrict, the, powers, of, the, president, the, communists, wanted, an, assembly, with, full, constitutional, powers, and, no, time, limit, whereas, de, gaulle, the, socialists, and, the, popular, republican, movement, mrp, advocated, one, with, a, term, limited, to, only, seven, months, after, which, the, draft, constitution, would, be, submitted, for, another, referendum, on, 13, november, 1945, the, new, assembly, unanimously, elected, charles, de, gaulle, head, of, the, government, but, problems, immediately, arose, when, it, came, to, selecting, the, cabinet, due, to, his, unwillingness, to, allow, the, communists, any, important, ministries, the, communists, now, the, largest, party, and, with, their, charismatic, leader, maurice, thorez, back, at, the, helm, were, not, prepared, to, accept, this, for, a, second, time, and, a, furious, row, ensued, during, which, de, gaulle, sent, a, letter, of, resignation, to, the, speaker, of, the, assembly, and, declared, that, he, was, unwilling, to, trust, a, party, that, he, considered, to, be, an, agent, of, a, foreign, power, russia, with, authority, over, the, police, and, armed, forces, eventually, the, new, cabinet, was, finalised, on, 21, november, with, the, communists, receiving, five, out, of, the, twenty, two, ministries, and, although, they, still, did, not, get, any, key, portfolios, de, gaulle, believed, that, the, draft, constitution, placed, too, much, power, in, the, hands, of, parliament, with, its, shifting, party, alliances, one, of, his, ministers, said, he, was, a, man, equally, incapable, of, monopolizing, power, as, of, sharing, it, de, gaulle, outlined, a, programme, of, further, nationalisations, and, a, new, economic, plan, which, were, passed, but, a, further, row, came, when, the, communists, demanded, a, 20, percent, reduction, in, the, military, budget, refusing, to, rule, by, compromise, de, gaulle, once, more, threatened, to, resign, there, was, a, general, feeling, that, he, was, trying, to, blackmail, the, assembly, into, complete, subservience, although, the, mrp, managed, to, broker, a, compromise, which, saw, the, budget, approved, with, amendments, it, was, a, stop, gap, measure, barely, two, months, after, forming, the, new, government, de, gaulle, abruptly, resigned, on, 20, january, 1946, the, move, was, called, a, bold, and, ultimately, foolish, political, ploy, with, de, gaulle, hoping, that, as, a, war, hero, he, would, be, soon, brought, back, as, a, more, powerful, executive, by, the, french, people, however, that, did, not, turn, out, to, be, the, case, with, the, war, finally, over, the, initial, crisis, had, passed, although, there, were, still, shortages, particularly, of, bread, france, was, now, recovering, and, de, gaulle, suddenly, did, not, seem, so, indispensable, the, communist, publication, combat, wrote, there, was, no, cataclysm, and, the, empty, plate, didn, t, crack, de, gaulle, suddenly, dropped, out, of, sight, and, returned, to, his, home, in, colombey, to, write, his, war, memoirs, de, gaulle, had, told, pierre, bertaux, in, 1944, that, he, planned, to, retire, because, france, may, still, one, day, need, an, image, that, is, pure, if, joan, of, arc, had, married, she, would, no, longer, have, been, joan, of, arc, the, famous, opening, paragraph, of, m, moires, de, guerre, begins, by, declaring, all, my, life, i, have, had, a, certain, idea, of, france, une, certaine, id, e, de, la, france, 2, and, ends, by, declaring, that, given, the, divisive, nature, of, french, politics, france, cannot, truly, live, up, to, this, ideal, without, a, policy, of, grandeur, during, this, period, of, formal, retirement, however, de, gaulle, maintained, regular, contact, with, past, political, lieutenants, including, sympathizers, involved, in, political, developments, in, french, algeria, becoming, perhaps, the, best, informed, man, in, france, in, april, 1947, de, gaulle, made, a, renewed, attempt, to, transform, the, political, scene, by, creating, a, rassemblement, du, peuple, fran, ais, rally, of, the, french, people, rpf, which, he, hoped, would, be, able, to, move, above, the, party, squabbles, of, the, parliamentary, system, despite, the, new, party, s, taking, 40, percent, of, the, vote, in, local, elections, and, 121, seats, in, 1951, lacking, its, own, press, and, access, to, television, its, support, ebbed, in, may, 1953, he, withdrew, again, from, active, politics, though, the, rpf, lingered, until, september, 1955, as, with, all, colonial, powers, france, began, to, lose, its, overseas, possessions, amid, the, surge, of, nationalism, french, indochina, now, vietnam, laos, and, cambodia, colonised, by, france, during, the, mid, 19th, century, had, been, lost, to, the, japanese, after, the, defeat, of, 1940, de, gaulle, had, intended, to, hold, on, to, france, s, indochina, colony, ordering, the, parachuting, of, french, agents, and, arms, into, indochina, in, late, 1944, and, early, 1945, with, orders, to, attack, the, japanese, as, american, troops, hit, the, beaches, although, de, gaulle, had, moved, quickly, to, consolidate, french, control, of, the, territory, during, his, brief, first, tenure, as, president, in, the, 1940s, the, communist, vietminh, under, ho, chi, minh, began, a, determined, campaign, for, independence, from, 1946, the, french, fought, a, bitter, seven, year, war, the, first, indochina, war, to, hold, on, to, indochina, it, was, largely, funded, by, the, united, states, and, grew, increasingly, unpopular, especially, after, the, stunning, defeat, at, the, battle, of, dien, bien, phu, france, pulled, out, that, summer, under, prime, minister, pierre, mend, s, france, the, independence, of, morocco, and, tunisia, was, arranged, by, mend, s, france, and, proclaimed, in, march, 1956, meanwhile, in, algeria, some, 350, 000, french, troops, were, fighting, 150, 000, combatants, of, the, algerian, liberation, movement, fln, within, a, few, years, the, algerian, war, of, independence, reached, a, summit, in, terms, of, savagery, and, bloodshed, and, threatened, to, spill, into, metropolitan, france, itself, between, 1946, and, 1958, the, fourth, republic, had, 24, separate, ministries, frustrated, by, the, endless, divisiveness, de, gaulle, famously, asked, how, can, you, govern, a, country, which, has, 246, varieties, of, cheese, the, fourth, republic, was, wracked, by, political, instability, failures, in, indochina, and, inability, to, resolve, the, algerian, question, on, 13, may, 1958, the, pied, noir, settlers, seized, the, government, buildings, in, algiers, attacking, what, they, saw, as, french, government, weakness, in, the, face, of, demands, among, the, fln, demand, for, algerian,

was, at, the, disposal, of, the, country, as, a, journalist, expressed, the, concerns, of, some, who, feared, that, he, would, violate, civil, liberties, de, gaulle, retorted, have, i, ever, done, that, on, the, contrary, i, have, re, established, them, when, they, had, disappeared, who, honestly, believes, that, at, age, 67, i, would, start, a, career, as, a, dictator, a, constitutionalist, by, conviction, he, maintained, that, he, would, accept, power, only, from, the, lawfully, constituted, authorities, de, gaulle, did, not, wish, to, repeat, the, difficulty, the, free, french, movement, experienced, in, establishing, legitimacy, as, the, rightful, government, he, told, an, aide, that, the, rebel, generals, will, not, find, de, gaulle, in, their, baggage, the, crisis,

of, our, history, was, our, chief, for, the, reconquest, of, freedom, and, who, refused, dictatorship, in, order, to, re, establish, the, republic, i, ask, general, de, gaulle, to, confer, with, the, head, of, state, and, to, examine, with, him, what, in, the, framework, of, republican, legality, is, necessary, for, the, immediate, formation, of, a, government, of, national, safety, and, what, can, be, done, in, a, fairly, short, time, for, a, deep, reform, of, our, institutions, de, gaulle, accepted, coty, s, proposal, under, the, precondition, that, a, new, constitution, would, be,

presidency, was, approved, at, the, referendum, on, 28, october, 1962, thereafter, the, president, was, to, be, elected, by, direct, universal, suffrage, for, the, first, time, since, louis, napoleon, in, 1848, in, december, 1965, de, gaulle, returned, as, president, for, a, second, seven, year, term, with, the, algerian, conflict, behind, him, de, gaulle, was, able, to, achieve, his, two, main, objectives, the, reform, and, development, of, the, french, economy, and, the, promotion, of, an, independent, foreign, policy, and, a, strong, presence, on, the, international, stage, this, was, named, by, foreign, observers, the, politics, of, grandeur, in, the, immediate, post, war, years, france, was, in, poor, shape, wages, remained, at, around, half, prewar, levels, the, winter, of, 1946, 1947, did, extensive, damage, to, crops, leading, to, a, reduction, in, the, bread, ration, hunger, and, disease, remained, rife, and, the, black, market, continued, to, flourish, germany, was, in, an, even, worse, position, but, after, 1948, things, began, to, improve, dramatically, with, the, introduction, of, marshall, aid, large, scale, american, financial, assistance, given, to, help, rebuild, european, economies, and, infrastructure, this, laid, the, foundations, of, a, meticulously, planned, program, of, investments, in, energy, transport, and, heavy, industry, overseen, by, the, government, of, prime, minister, georges, pompidou, aided, by, these, projects, the, french, economy, recorded, growth, rates, unrivalled, since, the, 19th, century, in, 1964, for, the, first, time, in, nearly, 100, years, france, s, gdp, overtook, that, of, the, united, kingdom, for, a, time, this, period, is, remembered, in, france, as, the, peak, of, the, trente, glorieuses, thirty, glorious, years, of, economic, growth, between, 1945, and, 1974, as, early, as, april, 1954, de, gaulle, argued, that, france, must, have, its, own, nuclear, arsenal, full, scale, research, began, again, in, late, 1954, when, prime, minister, pierre, mend, s, france, authorized, a, plan, to, develop, the, atomic, bomb, france, s, independent, force, de, frappe, strike, force, came, into, being, soon, after, de, gaulle, s, election, with, his, authorization, for, the, first, nuclear, test, with, the, cancellation, of, blue, streak, the, us, agreed, to, supply, britain, with, its, skybolt, and, later, polaris, weapons, systems, and, in, 1958, the, two, nations, signed, the, mutual, defence, agreement, although, at, the, time, it, was, still, a, full, member, of, nato, france, proceeded, to, develop, its, own, independent, nuclear, technologies, this, would, enable, it, to, become, a, partner, in, any, reprisals, and, would, give, it, a, voice, in, matters, of, atomic, control, after, six, years, of, effort, on, 13, february, 1960, france, became, the, world, s, fourth, nuclear, power, when, a, high, powered, nuclear, device, was, exploded, in, the, sahara, in, august, 1963, france, decided, against, signing, the, partial, test, ban, treaty, because, it, would, have, prohibited, it, from, testing, nuclear, weapons, above, ground, france, continued, to, carry, out, tests, at, the, algerian, site, until, 1966, under, an, agreement, with, the, newly, independent, algeria, france, s, testing, program, then, moved, to, the, mururoa, and, fangataufa, atolls, in, the, south, pacific, in, november, 1967, an, article, by, the, french, chief, of, the, general, staff, but, inspired, by, de, gaulle, in, the, revue, de, la, d, fense, nationale, caused, international, consternation, it, was, stated, that, the, french, nuclear, force, should, be, capable, of, firing, in, all, directions, thus, including, even, america, as, a, potential, target, this, surprising, statement, was, intended, as, a, declaration, of, french, national, independence, and, was, in, retaliation, to, a, warning, issued, long, ago, by, dean, rusk, that, us, missiles, would, be, aimed, at, france, if, it, attempted, to, employ, atomic, weapons, outside, an, agreed, plan, however, criticism, of, de, gaulle, was, growing, over, his, tendency, to, act, alone, with, little, regard, for, the, views, of, others, de, gaulle, hosted, a, superpower, summit, on, 17, may, 1960, for, arms, limitation, talks, and, d, tente, efforts, in, the, wake, of, the, 1960, u, 2, incident, between, united, states, president, dwight, eisenhower, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, and, united, kingdom, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, when, khrushchev, condemned, the, united, states, u, 2, flights, de, gaulle, expressed, to, khrushchev, his, disapproval, of, 18, near, simultaneous, secret, soviet, satellite, overflights, of, french, territory, khrushchev, denied, knowledge, of, the, overflights, lieutenant, general, vernon, a, walters, was, struck, by, de, gaulle, s, unconditional, support, of, the, united, states, during, that, crucial, time, de, gaulle, then, tried, to, revive, the, talks, by, inviting, all, the, delegates, to, another, conference, at, the, lys, e, palace, to, discuss, the, situation, but, the, summit, ultimately, dissolved, in, the, wake, of, the, u, 2, incident, in, february, 1966, france, withdrew, from, the, nato, military, command, structure, but, remained, within, the, organisation, de, gaulle, wanted, france, to, remain, the, master, of, the, decisions, affecting, it, he, also, ordered, all, foreign, military, personnel, to, leave, france, within, a, year, 431, this, latter, action, in, particular, was, poorly, received, in, the, us, de, gaulle, established, a, good, relationship, with, west, german, chancellor, konrad, adenauer, culminating, in, the, elysee, treaty, in, 1963, and, in, the, first, few, years, of, the, common, market, france, s, industrial, exports, to, the, other, five, members, tripled, and, its, farm, export, almost, quadrupled, the, franc, became, a, solid, stable, currency, for, the, first, time, in, half, a, century, and, the, economy, mostly, boomed, de, gaulle, vetoed, the, british, application, to, join, the, european, economic, community, eec, in, 1963, and, again, in, june, 1967, in, june, 1965, after, france, and, the, other, five, members, could, not, agree, de, gaulle, withdrew, france, s, representatives, from, the, ec, their, absence, left, the, organisation, essentially, unable, to, run, its, affairs, until, the, luxembourg, compromise, was, reached, in, january, 1966, de, gaulle, succeeded, in, influencing, the, decision, making, mechanism, written, into, the, treaty, of, rome, by, insisting, on, solidarity, founded, on, mutual, understanding, in, january, 1964, france, was, after, the, uk, among, the, first, of, the, major, western, powers, to, open, diplomatic, relations, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, by, recognizing, mao, zedong, s, government, de, gaulle, signaled, to, both, washington, and, moscow, that, france, intended, to, deploy, an, independent, foreign, policy, the, move, was, criticized, in, the, united, states, as, it, seemed, to, seriously, damage, us, policy, of, containment, in, asia, de, gaulle, justified, this, action, by, the, weight, of, evidence, and, reason, considering, that, china, s, demographic, weight, and, geographic, extent, put, it, in, a, position, to, have, a, global, leading, role, de, gaulle, also, used, this, opportunity, to, arouse, rivalry, between, the, ussr, and, china, in, september, 1966, in, a, famous, speech, in, phnom, penh, in, cambodia, he, expressed, france, s, disapproval, of, the, us, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, calling, for, a, withdrawal, with, tension, rising, in, the, middle, east, in, 1967, de, gaulle, declared, an, arms, embargo, against, israel, on, 2, june, just, three, days, before, the, outbreak, of, the, six, day, war, this, however, did, not, affect, spare, parts, for, the, french, military, hardware, with, which, the, israeli, armed, forces, were, equipped, under, de, gaulle, following, the, independence, of, algeria, france, embarked, on, foreign, policy, more, favorable, to, the, arab, side, president, de, gaulle, s, position, in, 1967, at, the, time, of, the, six, day, war, played, a, part, in, france, s, new, found, popularity, in, the, arab, world, in, his, letter, to, david, ben, gurion, dated, 9, january, 1968, de, gaulle, expressed, conviction, that, israel, had, ignored, his, warnings, and, overstepped, the, bounds, of, moderation, by, taking, the, territory, of, neighbouring, countries, by, force, believing, that, it, amounted, to, annexation, and, considered, withdrawing, from, these, areas, the, best, course, of, action, under, de, gaulle, s, leadership, france, supported, the, breakaway, republic, of, biafra, against, the, nigerian, government, during, the, nigerian, civil, war, although, french, arms, helped, to, keep, biafra, in, action, for, the, final, 15, months, of, the, civil, war, its, involvement, was, seen, as, insufficient, and, counterproductive, the, biafran, chief, of, staff, stated, that, the, french, did, more, harm, than, good, by, raising, false, hopes, and, by, providing, the, british, with, an, excuse, to, reinforce, nigeria, in, july, 1967, during, a, visit, to, canada, de, gaulle, shouted, vive, le, qu, bec, libre, vive, le, canada, fran, ais, et, vive, la, france, long, live, free, quebec, long, live, french, canada, and, long, live, france, to, a, large, crowd, from, a, balcony, at, montreal, s, city, hall, de, gaulle, abruptly, left, canada, two, days, later, the, speech, was, heavily, criticized, in, both, canada, and, france, but, was, seen, as, a, watershed, moment, by, the, quebec, sovereignty, movement, de, gaulle, s, government, was, criticized, within, france, particularly, for, its, heavy, handed, style, while, the, written, press, and, elections, were, free, and, private, stations, such, as, europe, 1, were, able, to, broadcast, in, french, from, abroad, the, state, s, ortf, had, a, monopoly, on, television, and, radio, this, monopoly, meant, that, the, government, was, in, a, position, to, directly, influence, broadcast, news, in, many, respects, gaullist, france, was, conservative, catholic, and, there, were, few, women, in, high, level, political, posts, in, may, 1968, the, government, s, ministers, were, 100, male, the, mass, demonstrations, and, strikes, in, france, in, may, 1968, severely, challenged, de, gaulle, s, legitimacy, he, and, other, government, leaders, feared, that, the, country, was, on, the, brink, of, revolution, or, civil, war, on, 29, may, de, gaulle, fled, to, baden, baden, in, germany, to, meet, with, general, massu, head, of, the, french, military, there, to, discuss, possible, army, intervention, de, gaulle, returned, to, france, after, being, assured, of, the, military, s, support, in, return, for, which, de, gaulle, agreed, to, amnesty, for, the, 1961, coup, plotters, and, oas, members, in, a, private, meeting, discussing, the, students, and, workers, demands, for, direct, participation, in, business, and, government, he, coined, the, phrase, la, r, forme, oui, la, chienlit, non, which, can, be, politely, translated, as, reform, yes, masquerade, chaos, no, it, was, a, vernacular, scatological, pun, meaning, chie, en, lit, no, shit, in, bed, no, the, term, is, now, common, parlance, in, french, political, commentary, but, de, gaulle, offered, to, accept, some, of, the, reforms, the, demonstrators, sought, he, again, considered, a, referendum, to, support, his, moves, but, on, 30, may, pompidou, persuaded, him, to, dissolve, parliament, and, hold, new, elections, the, june, 1968, elections, were, a, major, success, for, the, gaullists, his, party, won, 352, of, 487, seats, but, de, gaulle, remained, personally, unpopular, de, gaulle, resigned, the, presidency, at, noon, 28, april, 1969, following, the, rejection, of, his, proposed, reform, of, the, senate, and, local, governments, in, a, nationwide, referendum, two, months, later, georges, pompidou, was, elected, as, his, successor, de, gaulle, retired, once, again, to, his, nine, acre, country, estate, la, boisserie, the, woodland, glade, in, colombey, les, deux, glises, 120, miles, southeast, of, paris, there, the, general, who, often, described, old, age, as, a, shipwreck, continued, his, memoirs, dictated, to, his, secretary, from, notes, to, visitors, de, gaulle, said, i, will, finish, three, books, if, god, grants, me, life, the, renewal, the, first, of, three, planned, volumes, to, be, called, memoirs, of, hope, was, quickly, finished, and, immediately, became, the, fastest, seller, in, french, publishing, history, on, the, evening, of, 9, november, 1970, de, gaulle, who, had, generally, enjoyed, good, health, in, his, lifetime, died, suddenly, from, an, aneurysm, while, watching, the, news, on, television, his, wife, asked, that, she, be, allowed, to, inform, her, family, before, the, news, was, released, president, georges, pompidou, who, was, informed, early, the, next, day, announced, the, general, s, death, on, television, simply, saying, general, de, gaulle, is, dead, france, is, a, widow, de, gaulle, had, insisted, his, funeral, be, held, at, colombey, and, that, no, presidents, or, ministers, attend, only, his, compagnons, de, la, lib, ration, since, a, large, number, of, foreign, dignitaries, wanted, to, honor, de, gaulle, pompidou, arranged, a, separate, memorial, service, at, the, notre, dame, cathedral, to, be, held, at, the, same, time, as, his, actual, funeral, the, funeral, on, 12, november, 1970, was, the, biggest, such, event, in, french, history, and, a, national, mourning, was, declared, thousands, of, guests, attended, included, de, gaulle, s, successor, georges, pompidou, u, s, president, richard, nixon, british, prime, minister, edward, heath, un, secretary, general, u, thant, soviet, statesman, nikolai, podgorny, italian,

carried, to, his, grave, next, to, his, daughter, anne, by, eight, young, men, of, colombey, as, he, was, lowered, into, the, ground, the, bells, of, all, the, churches, in, france, tolled, starting, from, notre, dame, and, spreading, out, from, there, de, gaulle, specified, that, his, tombstone, bear, the, simple, inscription, of, his, name, and, his, years, of, birth, and, death, de, gaulle, married, yvonne, vendroux, on, 7, april, 1921, in, glise, notre, dame, de, calais, they, had, three, children, philippe, 1921, 2024, lisabeth, 1924, 2013, who, married, general, alain, de, boissieu, and, anne, 1928, 1948, anne, had, down, syndrome, and, died, of, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 20, de, gaulle, always, had, a, particular, love, for, his, daughter, anne, one, colombey, resident, recalled, how, he, used, to, walk, with, her, hand, in, hand, around, the, property, talking, quietly, about, the, things, she, understood, de, gaulle, had, an, older, brother, xavier, and, sister, marie, agnes, and, two, younger, brothers, jacques, and, pierre, one, of, de, gaulle, s, grandsons, also, named, charles, de, gaulle, was, a, member, of, the, european, parliament, from, 1994, to, 2004, his, last, tenure, being, for, the, far, right, national, front, the, younger, charles, de, gaulle, s, move, to, the, anti, gaullist, national, front, was, widely, condemned, by, other, family, members, it, was, like, hearing, the, pope, had, converted, to, islam, one, said, another, grandson, jean, de, gaulle, was, a, member, of, the, french, parliament, for, the, centre, right, ump, until, his, retirement, in, 2007, de, gaulle, made, 31, regional, tours, during, his, presidency, visiting, every, french, department, for, many, small, towns, the, visit, was, an, important, moment, in, history, he, enjoyed, entering, the, welcoming, crowds, an, aide, noted, how, often, people, said, he, saw, me, or, he, touched, me, and, another, recalled, how, a, mother, begged, de, gaulle, for, the, king, s, touch, on, her, baby, they, supporters, and, opponents, surmised, that, de, gaulle, was, a, monarch, like, figure, for, the, french, 616, 618, historians, have, accorded, napoleon, and, de, gaulle, the, top, ranking, status, of, french, leaders, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, according, to, a, 2005, survey, carried, out, in, the, context, of, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, death, of, fran, ois, mitterrand, 35, percent, of, respondents, said, mitterrand, was, the, best, french, president, ever, followed, by, charles, de, gaulle, 30, percent, and, jacques, chirac, 12, percent, another, poll, by, bva, four, years, later, showed, that, 87, of, french, people, regarded, his, presidency, positively, statues, honouring, de, gaulle, have, been, erected, in, london, warsaw, in, moscow, bucharest, and, quebec, the, first, algerian, president, ahmed, ben, bella, said, that, de, gaulle, was, the, military, leader, who, brought, us, the, hardest, blows, prior, to, algerian, independence, but, saw, further, than, other, politicians, and, had, a, universal, dimension, that, is, too, often, lacking, in, current, leaders, likewise, l, opold, s, dar, senghor, the, first, president, of, senegal, said, that, few, western, leaders, could, boast, of, having, risked, their, lives, to, grant, a, colony, independence, de, gaulle, was, admired, by, the, us, president, richard, nixon, after, a, meeting, at, the, palace, of, versailles, just, before, the, general, left, office, nixon, declared, that, he, did, not, try, to, put, on, airs, but, an, aura, of, majesty, seemed, to, envelop, him, his, performance, and, i, do, not, use, that, word, disparagingly, was, breathtaking, on, arriving, for, his, funeral, nixon, said, of, him, greatness, knows, no, national, boundaries, in, 1990, president, mitterrand, de, gaulle, s, old, political, rival, presided, over, the, celebrations, to, mark, the, 100th, anniversary, of, his, birth, mitterrand, who, once, wrote, a, vitriolic, critique, of, him, called, the, permanent, coup, d, tat, quoted, a, recent, opinion, poll, saying, as, general, de, gaulle, he, has, entered, the, pantheon, of, great, national, heroes, where, he, ranks, ahead, of, napoleon, and, behind, only, charlemagne, under, the, influence, of, jean, pierre, chev, nement, the, leader, of, ceres, the, left, wing, and, souverainist, faction, of, the, socialist, party, mitterrand, had, except, on, certain, economic, and, social, policies, rallied, to, much, of, gaullism, between, the, mid, 1970s, and, mid, 1990s, there, developed, a, left, right, consensus, dubbed, gaullo, mitterrandism, behind, the, french, status, in, nato, i, e, outside, the, integrated, military, command, a, number, of, commentators, have, been, critical, of, his, failure, to, prevent, the, massacres, after, algerian, independence, while, others, take, the, view, that, the, struggle, had, been, so, long, and, savage, that, it, was, inevitable, the, australian, historian, brian, crozier, wrote, that, he, was, able, to, part, with, algeria, without, civil, war, was, a, great, though, negative, achievement, which, in, all, probability, would, have, been, beyond, the, capacity, of, any, other, leader, france, possessed, de, gaulle, was, an, excellent, manipulator, of, the, media, as, seen, in, his, shrewd, use, of, television, to, persuade, around, 80, of, metropolitan, france, to, approve, the, new, constitution, for, the, fifth, republic, he, afterwards, enjoyed, massive, approval, ratings, and, once, said, that, every, frenchman, is, has, been, or, will, be, gaullist, that, de, gaulle, did, not, necessarily, reflect, mainstream, french, public, opinion, with, his, veto, was, suggested, by, the, decisive, majority, of, french, people, who, voted, in, favour, of, british, membership, when, pompidou, called, a, referendum, on, the, matter, in, 1972, his, early, influence, in, setting, the, parameters, of, the, eec, can, still, be, seen, most, notably, with, the, controversial, common, agricultural, policy, some, writers, take, the, view, that, pompidou, was, a, more, progressive, and, influential, leader, than, de, gaulle, because, though, also, a, gaullist, he, was, less, autocratic, and, more, interested, in, social, reforms, although, he, followed, the, main, tenets, of, de, gaulle, s, foreign, policy, he, was, keen, to, work, towards, warmer, relations, with, the, united, states, in, 1968, shortly, before, leaving, office, de, gaulle, refused, to, devalue, the, franc, on, grounds, of, national, prestige, but, upon, taking, over, pompidou, reversed, the, decision, almost, immediately, during, the, financial, crisis, of, 1968, france, had, to, rely, on, american, and, west, german, financial, aid, to, shore, up, the, economy, perry, has, written, that, the, events, of, 1968, illustrated, the, brittleness, of, de, gaulle, s, rule, that, he, was, taken, by, surprise, is, an, indictment, of, his, rule, he, was, too, remote, from, real, life, and, had, no, interest, in, the, conditions, under, which, ordinary, french, people, lived, problems, like, inadequate, housing, and, social, services, had, been, ignored, the, french, greeted, the, news, of, his, departure, with, some, relief, as, the, feeling, had, grown, that, he, had, outlived, his, usefulness, perhaps, he, clung, onto, power, too, long, perhaps, he, should, have, retired, in, 1965, when, he, was, still, popular, brian, crozier, said, the, fame, of, de, gaulle, outstrips, his, achievements, he, chose, to, make, repeated, gestures, of, petulance, and, defiance, that, weakened, the, west, without, compensating, advantages, to, france, r, gis, debray, called, de, gaulle, super, lucide, and, pointed, out, that, virtually, all, of, his, predictions, such, as, the, fall, of, communism, the, reunification, of, germany, and, the, resurrection, of, old, russia, came, true, after, his, death, debray, compared, him, with, napoleon, the, great, political, myth, of, the, 19th, century, calling, de, gaulle, his, 20th, century, equivalent, while, de, gaulle, had, many, admirers, he, was, also, one, of, the, most, hated, and, reviled, men, in, modern, french, history, a, number, of, monuments, have, been, built, to, commemorate, de, gaulle, france, s, largest, airport, located, in, roissy, outside, paris, is, named, charles, de, gaulle, airport, france, s, nuclear, powered, aircraft, carrier, is, also, named, after, him
