carthaginian, and, partially, celtic, army, he, won, a, succession, of, victories, at, the, battle, of, ticinus, trebia, lake, trasimene, and, cannae, inflicting, heavy, losses, on, the, romans, hannibal, was, distinguished, for, his, ability, to, determine, both, his, and, his, opponent, s, respective, strengths, and, weaknesses, and, to, plan, battles, accordingly, his, well, planned, strategies, allowed, him, to, conquer, and, ally, with, several, italian, cities, that, were, previously, allied, to, rome, hannibal, occupied, most, of, southern, italy, for, 15, years, the, romans, led, by, fabius, maximus, avoided, directly, engaging, him, instead, waging, a, war, of, attrition, the, fabian, strategy, carthaginian, defeats, in, hispania, prevented, hannibal, from, being, reinforced, and, he, was, unable, to, win, a, decisive, victory, a, counter, invasion, of, north, africa, led, by, the, roman, general, scipio, africanus, forced, him, to, return, to, carthage, hannibal, was, eventually, defeated, at, the, battle, of, zama, ending, the, war, in, a, roman, victory, after, the, war, hannibal, successfully, ran, for, the, office, of, sufet, he, enacted, political, and, financial, reforms, to, enable, the, payment, of, the, war, indemnity, imposed, by, rome, those, reforms, were, unpopular, with, members, of, the, carthaginian, aristocracy, and, in, rome, and, he, fled, into, voluntary, exile, during, this, time, he, lived, at, the, seleucid, court, where, he, acted, as, military, advisor, to, antiochus, iii, the, great, in, his, war, against,

generals, of, western, antiquity, alongside, alexander, the, great, cyrus, the, great, julius, caesar, scipio, africanus, and, pyrrhus, according, to, plutarch, scipio, asked, hannibal, who, the, greatest, general, was, to, which, hannibal, replied, either, alexander, or, pyrrhus, then, himself, hannibal, was, a, common, semitic, phoenician, carthaginian, personal, name, it, is, recorded, in, carthaginian, sources, as, nb, l, punic, it, is, a, combination, of, the, common, phoenician, masculine, given, name, hanno, with, the, northwest, semitic, canaanite, deity, baal, lit, lord, a, major, god, of, the, carthaginians, ancestral, homeland, of, phoenicia, in, western, asia, its, precise, vocalization, remains, a, matter, of, debate, suggested, readings, include, annoba, al, anniba, l, or, anniba, al, meaning, ba, al, the, lord, is, gracious, ba, al, has, been, gracious, or, the, grace, of, ba, al, it, is, equivalent, to, the, fellow, semitic, hebrew, name, haniel, greek, historians, rendered, the, name, as, ann, bas, the, phoenicians, and, carthaginians, like, many, west, asian, semitic, peoples, did, not, use, hereditary, surnames, but, were, typically, distinguished, from, others, bearing, the, same, name, using, patronymics, or, epithets, although, he, is, by, far, the, most, famous, hannibal, when, further, clarification, is, necessary, he, is, usually, referred, to, as, hannibal, son, of, hamilcar, or, hannibal, the, barcid, the, latter, term, applying, to, the, family, of, his, father, hamilcar, barca, barca, punic, brq, is, a, semitic, cognomen, meaning, lightning, or, thunderbolt, a, surname, acquired, by, hamilcar, on, account, of, the, swiftness, and, ferocity, of, his, attacks, barca, is, cognate, with, similar, names, for, lightning, found, among, the, israelites, assyrians, babylonians, arameans, arabs, amorites, moabites, edomites, and, other, fellow, asiatic, semitic, peoples, although, they, did, not, inherit, the, surname, from, their, father, hamilcar, s, progeny, are, collectively, known, as, the, barcids, modern, historians, occasionally, refer, to, hannibal, s, brothers, as, hasdrubal, barca, and, mago, barca, to, distinguish, them, from, the, multitudes, of, other, carthaginians, named, hasdrubal, and, mago, but, this, practice, is, ahistorical, and, is, rarely, applied, to, hannibal, hannibal, was, one, of, the, sons, of, hamilcar, barca, a, carthaginian, leader, and, an, unknown, mother, he, was, born, in, the, city, of, carthage, located, in, what, is, present, day, northern, tunisia, one, of, many, mediterranean, regions, colonised, by, the, canaanites, from, their, homeland, in, phoenicia, a, region, corresponding, with, the, mediterranean, coasts, of, modern, lebanon, and, syria, he, had, several, sisters, whose, names, are, unknown, and, two, brothers, hasdrubal, and, mago, his, brothers, in, law, were, hasdrubal, the, fair, and, the, numidian, king, naravas, he, was, still, a, child, when, his, sisters, married, and, his, brothers, in, law, were, close, associates, during, his, father, s, struggles, in, the, mercenary, war, and, the, punic, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, after, carthage, s, defeat, in, the, first, punic, war, hamilcar, set, out, to, improve, his, family, s, and, carthage, s, fortunes, with, that, in, mind, and, supported, by, gades, hamilcar, began, the, subjugation, of, the, tribes, of, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, spain, and, portugal, carthage, at, the, time, was, in, such, a, poor, state, that, it, lacked, a, navy, able, to, transport, his, army, instead, hamilcar, had, to, march, his, forces, across, numidia, towards, the, pillars, of, hercules, and, then, cross, the, strait, of, gibraltar, according, to, polybius, hannibal, much, later, said, that, when, he, came, upon, his, father, and, begged, to, go, with, him, hamilcar, agreed, and, demanded, that, hannibal, swear, that, he, would, never, be, a, friend, of, rome, as, long, as, he, lived, there, is, even, an, account, of, him, at, a, very, young, age, 9, years, old, begging, his, father, to, take, him, to, an, overseas, war, in, the, story, hannibal, s, father, took, him, up, and, brought, him, to, a, sacrificial, chamber, hamilcar, held, hannibal, over, the, fire, roaring, in, the, chamber, and, made, him, swear, that, he, would, never, be, a, friend, of, rome, other, sources, report, that, hannibal, told, his, father, i, swear, so, soon, as, age, will, permit, i, will, use, fire, and, steel, to, arrest, the, destiny, of, rome, according, to, the, tradition, hannibal, s, oath, took, place, in, the, town, of, pe, scola, today, part, of, the, valencian, community, spain, hannibal, s, father, went, about, with, the, conquest, of, hispania, when, his, father, drowned, in, battle, hannibal, s, brother, in, law, hasdrubal, the, fair, succeeded, to, his, command, of, the, army, with, hannibal, then, 18, years, old, serving, as, an, officer, under, him, hasdrubal, pursued, a, policy, of, consolidation, of, carthage, s, iberian, interests, even, signing, a, treaty, with, rome, whereby, carthage, would, not, expand, north, of, the, ebro, so, long, as, rome, did, not, expand, south, of, it, hasdrubal, also, endeavoured, to, consolidate, carthaginian, power, through, diplomatic, relationships, with, the, native, tribes, of, iberia, and, native, berbers, of, the, north, african, coasts, upon, the, assassination, of, hasdrubal, in, 221, bc, hannibal, now, 26, years, old, was, proclaimed, commander, in, chief, by, the, army, and, confirmed, in, his, appointment, by, the, carthaginian, government, the, roman, scholar, livy, gives, a, depiction, of, the, young, carthaginian, no, sooner, had, he, arrived, the, old, soldiers, fancied, they, saw, hamilcar, in, his, youth, given, back, to, them, the, same, bright, look, the, same, fire, in, his, eye, the, same, trick, of, countenance, and, features, never, was, one, and, the, same, spirit, more, skilful, to, meet, opposition, to, obey, or, to, command, livy, also, records, that, hannibal, married, a, woman, from, castulo, a, powerful, spanish, city, closely, allied, with, carthage, the, roman, epic, poet, silius, italicus, names, her, as, imilce, silius, suggests, a, greek, origin, for, imilce, but, gilbert, charles, picard, argued, for, a, punic, heritage, based, on, an, etymology, from, the, semitic, root, m, l, k, chief, the, king, silius, also, suggests, the, existence, of, a, son, who, is, otherwise, not, attested, by, livy, polybius, or, appian, the, son, may, have, been, named, haspar, or, aspar, although, this, is, disputed, after, he, assumed, command, hannibal, spent, two, years, consolidating, his, holdings, and, completing, the, conquest, of, hispania, south, of, the, ebro, in, his, first, campaign, hannibal, attacked, and, stormed, the, olcades, strongest, centre, alithia, which, promptly, led, to, their, surrender, and, brought, punic, power, close, to, the, river, tagus, his, following, campaign, in, 220, bc, was, against, the, vaccaei, to, the, west, where, he, stormed, the, vaccaen, strongholds, of, helmantice, and, arbucala, on, his, return, home, laden, with, many, spoils, a, coalition, of, spanish, tribes, led, by, the, carpetani, attacked, and, hannibal, won, his, first, major, battlefield, success, and, showed, off, his, tactical, skills, at, the, battle, of, the, river, tagus, rome, fearing, the, growing, strength, of, hannibal, in, iberia, made, an, alliance, with, the, city, of, saguntum, which, lay, a, considerable, distance, south, of, the, river, ebro, and, claimed, the, city, as, its, protectorate, hannibal, not, only, perceived, this, as, a, breach, of, the, treaty, signed, with, hasdrubal, but, as, he, was, already, planning, an, attack, on, rome, this, was, his, way, to, start, the, war, so, he, laid, siege, to, the, city, which, fell, after, eight, months, hannibal, sent, the, booty, from, saguntum, to, carthage, a, shrewd, move, which, gained, him, much, support, from, the, government, livy, records, that, only, hanno, ii, the, great, spoke, against, him, in, rome, the, senate, reacted, to, this, apparent, violation, of, the, treaty, by, dispatching, a, delegation, to, carthage, to, demand, whether, hannibal, had, destroyed, saguntum, in, accordance, with, orders, from, carthage, the, carthaginian, senate, responded, with, legal, arguments, observing, the, lack, of, ratification, by, either, government, for, the, treaty, alleged, to, have, been, violated, the, delegation, s, leader, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, demanded, carthage, choose, between, war, and, peace, to, which, his, audience, replied, that, rome, could, choose, fabius, chose, war, this, campaign, was, originally, planned, by, hannibal, s, brother, in, law, hasdrubal, the, fair, who, became, a, carthaginian, general, in, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 229, bc, he, maintained, this, post, for, eight, years, until, 221, bc, soon, the, romans, became, aware, of, an, alliance, between, carthage, and, the, celts, of, the, po, valley, in, northern, italy, when, hannibal, arrived, in, the, po, valley, roughly, 10, 000, celtic, tribesmen, joined, his, army, the, celts, were, amassing, forces, to, invade, farther, south, in, italy, presumably, with, carthaginian, backing, therefore, the, romans, pre, emptively, invaded, the, po, region, in, 225, bc, by, 220, bc, the, romans, had, annexed, the, area, as, cisalpine, gaul, hasdrubal, was, assassinated, around, the, same, time, 221, bc, bringing, hannibal, to, the, fore, it, seems, that, the, romans, lulled, themselves, into, a, false, sense, of, security, having, dealt, with, the, threat, of, a, gallo, carthaginian, invasion, and, perhaps, knowing, that, the, original, carthaginian, commander, had, been, killed, hannibal, departed, cartagena, spain, new, carthage, in, late, spring, of, 218, bc, he, fought, his, way, through, the, northern, tribes, to, the, foothills, of, the, pyrenees, subduing, the, tribes, through, clever, mountain, tactics, and, stubborn, fighting, he, left, a, detachment, of, 20, 000, troops, to, garrison, the, newly, conquered, region, at, the, pyrenees, he, released, 11, 000, iberian, troops, who, showed, reluctance, to, leave, their, homeland, hannibal, reportedly, entered, gaul, with, 40, 000, foot, soldiers, and, 12, 000, horsemen, hannibal, recognized, that, he, still, needed, to, cross, the, pyrenees, the, alps, and, many, large, rivers, additionally, he, would, have, to, contend, with, opposition, from, the, gauls, whose, territory, he, passed, through, starting, in, the, spring, of, 218, bc, he, crossed, the, pyrenees, and, by, conciliating, the, gaulish, chiefs, along, his, passage, before, the, romans, could, take, any, measures, to, bar, his, advance, was, able, to, reach, the, rh, ne, by, september, hannibal, s, army, numbered, 38, 000, infantry, 8, 000, cavalry, and, 38, elephants, almost, none, of, which, would, survive, the, harsh, conditions, of, the, alps, hannibal, outmanoeuvred, the, natives, who, had, tried, to, prevent, his, crossing, then, evaded, a, roman, force, marching, from, the, mediterranean, coast, by, turning, inland, up, the, valley, of, the, rh, ne, his, exact, route, over, the, alps, has, been, the, source, of, scholarly, dispute, ever, since, polybius, the, surviving, ancient, account, closest, in, time, to, hannibal, s, campaign, reports, that, the, route, was, already, debated, the, most, influential, modern, theories, favour, either, a, march, up, the, valley, of, the, dr, me, and, a, crossing, of, the, main, range, to, the, south, of, the, modern, highway, over, the, col, de, montgen, vre, or, a, march, farther, north, up, the, valleys, of, the, is, re, and, arc, crossing, the, main, range, near, the, present, col, de, mont, cenis, or, the, little, st, bernard, pass, recent, numismatic, evidence, suggests, that, hannibal, s, army, passed, within, sight, of, the, matterhorn, stanford, geoarchaeologist, patrick, hunt, argues, that, hannibal, took, the, col, de, clapier, mountain, pass, claiming, the, clapier, most, accurately, met, ancient, depictions, of, the, route, wide, view, of, italy, pockets, of, year, round, snow, and, a, large, campground, other, scholars, have, doubts, proposing, that, hannibal, took, the, easier, route, across, petit, mount, cenis, hunt, responds, to, this, by, proposing, that, hannibal, s, celtic, guides, purposefully, misguided, the, carthaginian, general, most, recently, w, c, mahaney, has, argued, col, de, la, traversette, closest, fits, the, records, of, ancient, authors, biostratigraphic, archaeological, data, has, reinforced, the, case, for, col, de, la, traversette, analysis, of, peat, bogs, near, watercourses, on, both, sides, of, the, pass, s, summit, showed, that, the, ground, was, heavily, disturbed, by, thousands, perhaps, tens, of, thousands, of, animals, and, humans, and, that, the, soil, bore, traces, of, unique, levels, of, clostridia, bacteria, associated, with, the, digestive, tract, of, horses, and, mules, radiocarbon, dating, secured, dates, of, 2168, bp, or, c, 218, bc, the, year, of, hannibal, s, march, mahaney, et, al, have, concluded, that, this, and, other, evidence, strongly, supports, the, col, de, la, traversette, as, being, the, hannibalic, route, as, had, been, argued, by, gavin, de, beer, in, 1954, de, beer, was, one, of, only, three, interpreters, the, others, being, john, lazenby, and, jakob, seibert, to, have, visited, all, the, alpine, high, passes, and, presented, a, view, on, which, was, most, plausible, both, de, beer, and, siebert, had, selected, the, col, de, la, traversette, as, the, one, most, closely, matching, the, ancient, descriptions, polybius, wrote, that, hannibal, had, crossed, the, highest, of, the, alpine, passes, col, de, la, traversette, between, the, upper, guil, valley, and, the, upper, po, river, is, the, highest, pass, it, is, moreover, the, most, southerly, as, varro, in, his, de, re, rustica, relates, agreeing, that, hannibal, s, pass, was, the, highest, in, western, alps, and, the, most, southerly, mahaney, et, al, argue, that, factors, used, by, de, beer, to, support, col, de, la, traversette, including, gauging, ancient, place, names, against, modern, close, scrutiny, of, times, of, flood, in, major, rivers, and, distant, viewing, of, the, po, plains, taken, together, with, massive, radiocarbon, and, microbiological, and, parasitical, evidence, from, the, alluvial, sediments, either, side, of, the, pass, furnish, supporting, evidence, proof, if, you, will, that, hannibal, s, invasion, went, that, way, if, hannibal, had, ascended, the, col, de, la, traversette, the, po, valley, would, indeed, have, been, visible, from, the, pass, s, summit, vindicating, polybius, s, account, by, livy, s, account, the, crossing, was, accomplished, in, the, face, of, huge, difficulties, these, hannibal, surmounted, with, ingenuity, such, as, when, he, used, vinegar, and, fire, to, break, through, a, rockfall, according, to, polybius, he, arrived, in, italy, accompanied, by, 20, 000, foot, soldiers, 4, 000, horsemen, and, only, a, few, elephants, the, fired, rockfall, event, is, mentioned, only, by, livy, polybius, is, mute, on, the, subject, and, there, is, no, evidence, of, carbonized, rock, at, the, only, two, tier, rockfall, in, the, western, alps, located, below, the, col, de, la, traversette, mahaney, 2008, if, polybius, is, correct, in, his, figure, for, the, number, of, troops, that, he, commanded, after, the, crossing, of, the, rh, ne, this, would, suggest, that, he, had, lost, almost, half, of, his, force, historians, such, as, serge, lancel, have, questioned, the, reliability, of, the, figures, for, the, number, of, troops, that, he, had, when, he, left, hispania, from, the, start, he, seems, to, have, calculated, that, he, would, have, to, operate, without, aid, from, hispania, hannibal, s, vision, of, military, affairs, was, derived, partly, from, the, teaching, of, his, greek, tutors, and, partly, from, experience, gained, alongside, his, father, and, it, stretched, over, most, of, the, hellenistic, world, of, his, time, the, breadth, of, his, vision, gave, rise, to, his, grand, strategy, of, conquering, rome, by, opening, a, northern, front, and, subduing, allied, city, states, on, the, peninsula, rather, than, by, attacking, rome, directly, historical, events, that, led, to, the, defeat, of, carthage, during, the, first, punic, war, when, his, father, commanded, the, carthaginian, army, also, led, hannibal, to, plan, the, invasion, of, italy, by, land, across, the, alps, the, task, involved, the, mobilization, of, between, 60, 000, and, 100, 000, troops, and, the, training, of, a, war, elephant, corps, all, of, which, had, to, be, provisioned, along, the, way, the, alpine, invasion, of, italy, was, a, military, operation, that, would, shake, the, mediterranean, world, of, 218, bc, with, repercussions, for, more, than, two, decades, hannibal, s, perilous, march, brought, him, into, the, roman, territory, and, frustrated, the, attempts, of, the, enemy, to, fight, out, the, main, issue, on, foreign, ground, his, sudden, appearance, among, the, gauls, of, the, po, valley, moreover, enabled, him, to, detach, those, tribes, from, their, new, allegiance, to, the, romans, before, the, romans, could, take, steps, to, check, the, rebellion, publius, cornelius, scipio, was, the, consul, who, commanded, the, roman, force, sent, to, intercept, hannibal, he, was, also, the, father, of, scipio, africanus, he, had, not, expected, hannibal, to, make, an, attempt, to, cross, the, alps, since, the, romans, were, prepared, to, fight, the, war, in, the, iberian, peninsula, with, a, small, detachment, still, positioned, in, gaul, scipio, made, an, attempt, to, intercept, hannibal, he, succeeded, through, prompt, decision, and, speedy, movement, in, transporting, his, army, to, italy, by, sea, in, time, to, meet, hannibal, hannibal, s, forces, moved, through, the, po, valley, and, were, engaged, in, the, battle, of, ticinus, here, hannibal, forced, the, romans, to, evacuate, the, plain, of, lombardy, by, virtue, of, his, superior, cavalry, the, victory, was, minor, but, it, encouraged, the, gauls, and, ligurians, to, join, the, carthaginian, cause, their, troops, bolstered, his, army, back, to, around, 40, 000, men, scipio, was, severely, injured, his, life, only, saved, by, the, bravery, of, his, son, who, rode, back, onto, the, field, to, rescue, his, fallen, father, scipio, retreated, across, the, trebia, to, camp, at, placentia, with, his, army, mostly, intact, the, other, roman, consular, army, was, rushed, to, the, po, valley, even, before, news, of, the, defeat, at, ticinus, had, reached, rome, the, senate, had, ordered, consul, tiberius, sempronius, longus, to, bring, his, army, back, from, sicily, to, meet, scipio, and, face, hannibal, hannibal, by, skillful, maneuvers, was, in, position, to, head, him, off, for, he, lay, on, the, direct, road, between, placentia, and, arminum, by, which, sempronius, would, have, to, march, to, reinforce, scipio, he, then, captured, clastidium, from, which, he, drew, large, amounts, of, supplies, for, his, men, but, this, gain, was, not, without, loss, as, sempronius, avoided, hannibal, s, watchfulness, slipped, around, his, flank, and, joined, his, colleague, in, his, camp, near, the, trebia, river, near, placentia, there, hannibal, had, an, opportunity, to, show, his, masterful, military, skill, at, the, trebia, in, december, of, the, same, year, after, wearing, down, the, superior, roman, infantry, when, he, cut, it, to, pieces, with, a, surprise, attack, and, ambush, from, the, flanks, however, most, or, all, of, his, war, elephants, had, died, of, injuries, or, the, cold, that, winter, and, none, took, part, in, the, succeeding, battles, at, lake, trasimene, and, or, cannae, hannibal, quartered, his, troops, for, the, winter, with, the, gauls, whose, support, for, him, had, abated, fearing, the, possibility, of, an, assassination, attempt, by, his, gallic, allies, hannibal, had, a, number, of, wigs, made, dyed, to, suit, the, appearance, of, persons, differing, widely, in, age, and, kept, constantly, changing, them, so, that, any, would, be, assassins, wouldn, t, recognize, him, in, the, spring, of, 217, bc, hannibal, decided, to, find, a, more, reliable, base, of, operations, farther, south, gnaeus, servilius, and, gaius, flaminius, the, new, consuls, of, rome, were, expecting, hannibal, to, advance, on, rome, and, they, took, their, armies, to, block, the, eastern, and, western, routes, that, hannibal, could, use, the, only, alternative, route, to, central, italy, lay, at, the, mouth, of, the, arno, this, area, was, practically, one, huge, marsh, and, happened, to, be, overflowing, more, than, usual, during, this, particular, season, hannibal, knew, that, this, route, was, full, of, difficulties, but, it, remained, the, surest, and, certainly, the, quickest, way, to, central, italy, polybius, claims, that, hannibal, s, men, marched, for, four, days, and, three, nights, through, a, land, that, was, under, water, suffering, terribly, from, fatigue, and, enforced, want, of, sleep, he, crossed, without, opposition, over, both, the, apennines, during, which, he, lost, his, right, eye, because, of, conjunctivitis, and, the, seemingly, impassable, arno, but, he, lost, a, large, part, of, his, force, in, the, marshy, lowlands, of, the, arno, he, arrived, in, etruria, in, the, spring, of, 217, bc, and, decided, to, lure, the, main, roman, army, under, flaminius, into, a, pitched, battle, by, devastating, the, region, that, flaminius, had, been, sent, to, protect, as, polybius, recounts, he, calculated, that, if, he, passed, the, camp, and, made, a, descent, into, the, district, beyond, flaminius, partly, for, fear, of, popular, reproach, and, partly, of, personal, irritation, would, be, unable, to, endure, watching, passively, the, devastation, of, the, country, but, would, spontaneously, follow, him, and, give, him, opportunities, for, attack, at, the, same, time, hannibal, tried, to, break, the, allegiance, of, rome, s, allies, by, proving, that, flaminius, was, powerless, to, protect, them, despite, this, flaminius, remained, passively, encamped, at, arretium, hannibal, marched, boldly, around, flaminius, left, flank, unable, to, draw, him, into, battle, by, mere, devastation, and, effectively, cut, him, off, from, rome, executing, the, first, recorded, turning, movement, in, military, history, he, then, advanced, through, the, uplands, of, etruria, provoking, flaminius, into, a, hasty, pursuit, and, catching, him, in, a, defile, on, the, shore, of, lake, trasimenus, there, hannibal, destroyed, flaminius, army, in, the, waters, or, on, the, adjoining, slopes, killing, flaminius, as, well, see, battle, of, lake, trasimene, this, was, the, most, costly, ambush, that, the, romans, ever, sustained, until, the, battle, of, carrhae, against, the, parthian, empire, hannibal, had, now, disposed, of, the, only, field, force, that, could, check, his, advance, upon, rome, he, realized, that, without, siege, engines, he, could, not, hope, to, take, the, capital, he, opted, to, exploit, his, victory, by, entering, into, central, and, southern, italy, and, encouraging, a, general, revolt, against, the, sovereign, power, the, romans, appointed, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, as, their, dictator, departing, from, roman, military, traditions, fabius, adopted, the, strategy, named, after, him, avoiding, open, battle, while, placing, several, roman, armies, in, hannibal, s, vicinity, in, order, to, watch, and, limit, his, movements, hannibal, ravaged, apulia, but, was, unable, to, bring, fabius, to, battle, so, he, decided, to, march, through, samnium, to, campania, one, of, the, richest, and, most, fertile, provinces, of, italy, hoping, that, the, devastation, would, draw, fabius, into, battle, fabius, closely, followed, hannibal, s, path, of, destruction, yet, still, refused, to, let, himself, be, drawn, out, of, the, defensive, this, strategy, was, unpopular, with, many, romans, who, believed, that, it, was, a, form, of, cowardice, hannibal, decided, that, it, would, be, unwise, to, winter, in, the, already, devastated, lowlands, of, campania, but, fabius, had, trapped, him, there, by, ensuring, that, all, the, exit, passes, were, blocked, this, situation, led, to, the, night, battle, of, ager, falernus, hannibal, had, his, men, tie, burning, torches, to, the, horns, of, a, herd, of, cattle, and, drive, them, up, the, heights, nearby, some, of, the, romans, seeing, a, moving, column, of, lights, were, tricked, into, believing, it, was, the, carthaginian, army, marching, to, escape, along, the, heights, as, they, moved, off, in, pursuit, of, this, decoy, hannibal, managed, to, move, his, army, in, complete, silence, through, the, dark, lowlands, and, up, to, an, unguarded, pass, fabius, himself, was, within, striking, distance, but, in, this, case, his, caution, worked, against, him, as, rightly, sensing, a, trick, he, stayed, put, thus, hannibal, managed, to, stealthily, escape, with, his, entire, army, intact, what, hannibal, achieved, in, extricating, his, army, was, as, adrian, goldsworthy, puts, it, a, classic, of, ancient, generalship, finding, its, way, into, nearly, every, historical, narrative, of, the, war, and, being, used, by, later, military, manuals, this, was, a, severe, blow, to, fabius, prestige, and, soon, after, this, his, period, of, dictatorial, power, ended, for, the, winter, hannibal, found, comfortable, quarters, in, the, apulian, plain, in, the, spring, of, 216, bc, hannibal, took, the, initiative, and, seized, the, large, supply, depot, at, cannae, in, the, apulian, plain, by, capturing, cannae, hannibal, had, placed, himself, between, the, romans, and, their, crucial, sources, of, supply, once, the, roman, senate, resumed, their, consular, elections, in, 216, bc, they, appointed, gaius, terentius, varro, and, lucius, aemilius, paullus, as, consuls, in, the, meantime, the, romans, hoped, to, gain, success, through, sheer, strength, and, weight, of, numbers, and, they, raised, a, new, army, of, unprecedented, size, estimated, by, some, to, be, as, large, as, 100, 000, men, but, more, likely, around, 50, 000, 80, 000, the, romans, and, allied, legions, resolved, to, confront, hannibal, and, marched, southward, to, apulia, they, eventually, found, him, on, the, left, bank, of, the, aufidus, river, and, encamped, 10, km, 6, mi, away, on, this, occasion, the, two, armies, were, combined, into, one, the, consuls, having, to, alternate, their, command, on, a, daily, basis, according, to, livy, varro, was, a, man, of, reckless, and, hubristic, nature, and, it, was, his, turn, to, command, on, the, day, of, battle, this, account, is, possibly, biased, against, varro, as, its, main, source, polybius, was, a, client, of, paullus, s, aristocratic, family, whereas, varro, was, less, distinguished, some, historians, have, suggested, that, the, sheer, size, of, the, army, required, both, generals, to, command, a, wing, each, this, theory, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, after, varro, survived, the, battle, he, was, pardoned, by, the, senate, which, would, be, peculiar, if, he, were, the, sole, commander, at, fault, hannibal, capitalized, on, the, eagerness, of, the, romans, and, drew, them, into, a, trap, by, using, an, envelopment, tactic, this, eliminated, the, roman, numerical, advantage, by, shrinking, the, combat, area, hannibal, drew, up, his, least, reliable, infantry, in, the, centre, in, a, semicircle, curving, towards, the, romans, placing, them, forward, of, the, wings, allowed, them, room, to, fall, back, luring, the, romans, after, them, while, the, cavalry, on, the, flanks, dealt, with, their, roman, counterparts, hannibal, s, wings, were, composed, of, the, gallic, and, numidian, cavalry, the, roman, legions, forced, their, way, through, hannibal, s, weak, centre, but, the, libyan, mercenaries, on, the, wings, swung, around, by, the, movement, menaced, their, flanks, the, onslaught, of, hannibal, s, cavalry, was, unstoppable, hannibal, s, chief, cavalry, commander, maharbal, led, the, mobile, numidian, cavalry, on, the, right, which, shattered, the, roman, cavalry, opposing, them, hannibal, s, iberian, and, gallic, heavy, cavalry, on, the, left, led, by, hanno, defeated, the, roman, heavy, cavalry, after, which, both, the, carthaginian, heavy, cavalry, and, the, numidians, attacked, the, legions, from, behind, as, a, result, the, roman, army, was, fully, surrounded, with, no, means, of, escape, due, to, these, brilliant, tactics, hannibal, managed, to, surround, and, destroy, all, but, a, small, remnant, of, his, enemy, despite, his, own, inferior, numbers, depending, upon, the, source, it, is, estimated, that, 50, 000, 70, 000, romans, were, killed, or, captured, among, the, dead, were, roman, consul, lucius, aemilius, paullus, two, consuls, for, the, preceding, year, two, quaestors, 29, of, the, 48, military, tribunes, and, an, additional, eighty, senators, at, a, time, when, the, roman, senate, was, composed, of, no, more, than, 300, men, this, constituted, 25, 30, of, the, governing, body, this, makes, the, battle, one, of, the, most, catastrophic, defeats, in, the, history, of, ancient, rome, and, one, of, the, bloodiest, battles, in, all, of, human, history, in, terms, of, the, number, of, lives, lost, in, a, single, day, after, cannae, the, romans, were, very, hesitant, to, confront, hannibal, in, pitched, battle, preferring, instead, to, weaken, him, by, attrition, relying, on, their, advantages, of, interior, lines, supply, and, manpower, as, a, result, hannibal, fought, no, more, major, battles, in, italy, for, the, rest, of, the, war, it, is, believed, that, his, refusal, to, bring, the, war, to, rome, itself, was, due, to, a, lack, of, commitment, from, carthage, of, men, money, and, material, principally, siege, equipment, whatever, the, reason, the, choice, prompted, maharbal, to, say, hannibal, you, know, how, to, gain, a, victory, but, not, how, to, use, one, as, a, result, of, this, victory, many, parts, of, italy, joined, hannibal, s, cause, as, polybius, notes, how, much, more, serious, was, the, defeat, of, cannae, than, those, that, preceded, it, can, be, seen, by, the, behaviour, of, rome, s, allies, before, that, fateful, day, their, loyalty, remained, unshaken, now, it, began, to, waver, for, the, simple, reason, that, they, despaired, of, roman, power, during, that, same, year, the, greek, cities, in, sicily, were, induced, to, revolt, against, roman, political, control, while, macedonian, king, philip, v, pledged, his, support, to, hannibal, initiating, the, first, macedonian, war, against, rome, hannibal, also, secured, an, alliance, with, newly, appointed, tyrant, hieronymus, of, syracuse, it, is, often, argued, that, if, hannibal, had, received, proper, material, reinforcements, from, carthage, he, might, have, succeeded, with, a, direct, attack, upon, rome, instead, he, had, to, content, himself, with, subduing, the, fortresses, that, still, held, out, against, him, and, the, only, other, notable, event, of, 216, bc, was, the, defection, of, certain, italian, territories, including, capua, the, second, largest, city, of, italy, which, hannibal, made, his, new, base, however, only, a, few, of, the, italian, city, states, that, he, had, expected, to, gain, as, allies, defected, to, him, the, war, in, italy, settled, into, a, strategic, stalemate, the, romans, used, the, attritional, strategy, that, fabius, had, taught, them, which, they, finally, realized, was, the, only, feasible, means, of, defeating, hannibal, fabius, received, the, name, cunctator, the, delayer, because, of, his, policy, of, not, meeting, hannibal, in, open, battle, but, through, attrition, the, romans, deprived, hannibal, of, a, large, scale, battle, and, instead, assaulted, his, weakening, army, with, multiple, smaller, armies, in, an, attempt, to, both, weary, him, and, create, unrest, in, his, troops, for, the, next, few, years, hannibal, was, forced, to, sustain, a, scorched, earth, policy, and, obtain, local, provisions, for, protracted, and, ineffectual, operations, throughout, southern, italy, his, immediate, objectives, were, reduced, to, minor, operations, centred, mainly, around, the, cities, of, campania, the, forces, detached, to, his, lieutenants, were, generally, unable, to, hold, their, own, and, neither, his, home, government, nor, his, new, ally, philip, v, of, macedon, helped, to, make, up, his, losses, his, position, in, southern, italy, therefore, became, increasingly, difficult, and, his, chance, of, ultimately, conquering, rome, grew, ever, more, remote, hannibal, still, won, a, number, of, notable, victories, completely, destroying, two, roman, armies, in, 212, bc, and, killing, two, consuls, including, the, famed, marcus, claudius, marcellus, in, a, battle, in, 208, bc, however, hannibal, slowly, began, losing, ground, inadequately, supported, by, his, italian, allies, abandoned, by, his, government, either, because, of, jealousy, or, simply, because, carthage, was, overstretched, and, unable, to, match, rome, s, resources, he, was, never, able, to, bring, about, another, grand, decisive, victory, that, could, produce, a, lasting, strategic, change, carthaginian, political, will, was, embodied, in, the, ruling, oligarchy, there, was, a, carthaginian, senate, but, the, real, power, was, with, the, inner, council, of, 30, nobles, and, the, board, of, judges, from, ruling, families, known, as, the, hundred, and, four, these, two, bodies, came, from, the, wealthy, commercial, families, of, carthage, two, political, factions, operated, in, carthage, the, war, party, also, known, as, the, barcids, hannibal, s, family, name, and, the, peace, party, led, by, hanno, ii, the, great, hanno, had, been, instrumental, in, denying, hannibal, s, requested, reinforcements, following, the, battle, at, cannae, hannibal, started, the, war, without, the, full, backing, of, carthaginian, oligarchy, his, attack, of, saguntum, had, presented, the, oligarchy, with, a, choice, of, war, with, rome, or, loss, of, prestige, in, iberia, the, oligarchy, not, hannibal, controlled, the, strategic, resources, of, carthage, hannibal, constantly, sought, reinforcements, from, either, iberia, or, north, africa, hannibal, s, troops, who, were, lost, in, combat, were, replaced, with, less, well, trained, and, motivated, mercenaries, from, italy, or, gaul, the, commercial, interests, of, the, carthaginian, oligarchy, dictated, the, reinforcement, and, supply, of, iberia, rather, than, hannibal, throughout, the, campaign, in, march, 212, bc, hannibal, captured, tarentum, in, a, surprise, attack, but, he, failed, to, obtain, control, of, its, harbor, the, tide, was, slowly, turning, against, him, and, in, favor, of, rome, the, roman, consuls, mounted, a, siege, of, capua, in, 212, bc, hannibal, attacked, them, forcing, their, withdrawal, from, campania, he, moved, to, lucania, and, destroyed, a, 16, 000, man, roman, army, at, the, battle, of, the, silarus, with, 15, 000, romans, killed, another, opportunity, presented, itself, soon, after, a, roman, army, of, 18, 000, men, being, destroyed, by, hannibal, at, the, first, battle, of, herdonia, with, 16, 000, romans, dead, freeing, apulia, from, the, romans, for, the, year, the, roman, consuls, mounted, another, siege, of, capua, in, 211, bc, conquering, the, city, hannibal, s, attempt, to, lift, the, siege, with, an, assault, on, the, roman, siege, lines, failed, he, marched, on, rome, to, force, the, recall, of, the, roman, armies, he, drew, off, 15, 000, roman, soldiers, but, the, siege, continued, and, capua, fell, in, 212, bc, marcellus, conquered, syracuse, and, the, romans, destroyed, the, carthaginian, army, in, sicily, in, 211, 210, bc, in, 210, bc, the, romans, entered, into, an, alliance, with, the, aetolian, league, to, counter, philip, v, of, macedon, philip, who, attempted, to, exploit, rome, s, preoccupation, in, italy, to, conquer, illyria, now, found, himself, under, attack, from, several, sides, at, once, and, was, quickly, subdued, by, rome, and, her, greek, allies, in, 210, bc, hannibal, again, proved, his, superiority, in, tactics, by, inflicting, a, severe, defeat, at, the, battle, of, herdonia, modern, ordona, in, apulia, upon, a, proconsular, army, and, in, 208, bc, destroyed, a, roman, force, engaged, in, the, siege, of, locri, at, the, battle, of, petelia, but, with, the, loss, of, tarentum, in, 209, bc, and, the, gradual, reconquest, by, the, romans, of, samnium, and, lucania, his, hold, on, south, italy, was, almost, lost, in, 207, bc, he, succeeded, in, making, his, way, again, into, apulia, where, he, waited, to, concert, measures, for, a, combined, march, upon, rome, with, his, brother, hasdrubal, on, hearing, of, his, brother, s, defeat, and, death, at, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, he, retired, to, calabria, where, he, maintained, himself, for, the, ensuing, years, his, brother, s, head, had, been, cut, off, carried, across, italy, and, tossed, over, the, palisade, of, hannibal, s, camp, as, a, cold, message, of, the, iron, clad, will, of, the, roman, republic, the, combination, of, these, events, marked, the, end, to, hannibal, s, success, in, italy, with, the, failure, of, his, brother, mago, in, liguria, 205, 203, bc, and, of, his, own, negotiations, with, phillip, v, the, last, hope, of, recovering, his, ascendancy, in, italy, was, lost, in, 203, bc, after, nearly, fifteen, years, of, fighting, in, italy, and, with, the, military, fortunes, of, carthage, rapidly, declining, hannibal, was, recalled, to, carthage, to, direct, the, defense, of, his, native, country, against, a, roman, invasion, under, scipio, africanus, in, 203, bc, hannibal, was, recalled, from, italy, by, the, war, party, in, carthage, after, leaving, a, record, of, his, expedition, engraved, in, punic, and, greek, upon, bronze, tablets, in, the, temple, of, juno, lacinia, at, crotona, he, sailed, back, to, africa, his, arrival, immediately, restored, the, predominance, of, the, war, party, which, placed, him, in, command, of, a, combined, force, of, african, levies, and, his, mercenaries, from, italy, in, 202, bc, hannibal, met, scipio, in, a, fruitless, peace, conference, despite, mutual, admiration, negotiations, floundered, due, to, roman, allegations, of, punic, faith, referring, to, the, breach, of, protocols, that, ended, the, first, punic, war, by, the, carthaginian, attack, on, saguntum, and, a, carthaginian, attack, on, a, stranded, roman, fleet, scipio, and, carthage, had, worked, out, a, peace, plan, which, was, approved, by, rome, the, terms, of, the, treaty, were, quite, modest, but, the, war, had, been, long, for, the, romans, carthage, could, keep, its, african, territory, but, would, lose, its, overseas, empire, masinissa, numidia, was, to, be, independent, also, carthage, was, to, reduce, its, fleet, and, pay, a, war, indemnity, carthage, then, made, a, terrible, blunder, its, long, suffering, citizens, had, captured, a, stranded, roman, fleet, in, the, gulf, of, tunis, and, stripped, it, of, supplies, an, action, that, aggravated, the, faltering, negotiations, fortified, by, both, hannibal, and, the, supplies, the, carthaginians, rebuffed, the, treaty, and, roman, protests, the, decisive, battle, of, zama, soon, followed, the, defeat, removed, hannibal, s, aura, of, invincibility, unlike, most, battles, of, the, second, punic, war, at, zama, the, romans, were, superior, in, cavalry, and, the, carthaginians, had, the, edge, in, infantry, this, roman, cavalry, superiority, was, due, to, the, betrayal, of, masinissa, who, had, earlier, assisted, carthage, in, iberia, but, changed, sides, in, 206, bc, with, the, promise, of, land, and, due, to, his, personal, conflicts, with, syphax, a, carthaginian, ally, although, the, ageing, hannibal, was, suffering, from, mental, exhaustion, and, deteriorating, health, after, years, of, campaigning, in, italy, the, carthaginians, still, had, the, advantage, in, numbers, and, were, boosted, by, the, presence, of, 80, war, elephants, the, roman, cavalry, won, an, early, victory, by, swiftly, routing, the, carthaginian, cavalry, the, romans, were, also, successful, in, limiting, the, effectiveness, of, the, carthaginian, war, elephants, with, tactics, such, as, playing, trumpets, to, frighten, the, elephants, and, cause, them, to, run, into, the, carthaginian, lines, some, historians, say, that, the, elephants, routed, the, carthaginian, cavalry, and, not, the, romans, whilst, others, suggest, that, it, was, actually, a, tactical, retreat, planned, by, hannibal, whatever, the, truth, the, battle, remained, closely, fought, at, one, point, it, seemed, that, hannibal, was, on, the, verge, of, victory, but, scipio, was, able, to, rally, his, men, scipio, s, cavalry, having, routed, the, carthaginian, cavalry, attacked, hannibal, s, rear, this, two, pronged, attack, caused, the, carthaginian, formation, to, collapse, with, their, foremost, general, defeated, the, carthaginians, had, no, choice, but, to, surrender, carthage, lost, approximately, 20, 000, troops, with, an, additional, 15, 000, wounded, in, contrast, the, romans, suffered, only, 2, 500, casualties, the, last, major, battle, of, the, second, punic, war, resulted, in, a, loss, of, respect, for, hannibal, by, his, fellow, carthaginians, the, conditions, of, defeat, were, such, that, carthage, could, no, longer, battle, for, mediterranean, supremacy, hannibal, was, still, only, 46, at, the, conclusion, of, the, second, punic, war, in, 201, bc, and, soon, showed, that, he, could, be, a, statesman, as, well, as, a, soldier, following, the, conclusion, of, a, peace, that, left, carthage, saddled, with, an, indemnity, of, ten, thousand, talents, he, was, elected, suffete, chief, magistrate, of, the, carthaginian, state, after, an, audit, confirmed, carthage, had, the, resources, to, pay, the, indemnity, without, increasing, taxation, hannibal, initiated, a, reorganization, of, state, finances, aimed, at, eliminating, corruption, and, recovering, embezzled, funds, the, principal, beneficiaries, of, these, financial, peculations, had, been, the, oligarchs, of, the, hundred, and, four, in, order, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, oligarchs, hannibal, passed, a, law, stipulating, the, hundred, and, four, be, chosen, by, direct, election, rather, than, co, option, he, also, used, citizen, support, to, change, the, term, of, office, in, the, hundred, and, four, from, life, to, a, year, with, none, permitted, to, hold, office, for, two, consecutive, years, seven, years, after, the, victory, of, zama, the, romans, alarmed, by, carthage, s, renewed, prosperity, and, suspicious, that, hannibal, had, been, in, contact, with, antiochus, iii, of, the, seleucid, empire, sent, a, delegation, to, carthage, alleging, that, hannibal, was, helping, an, enemy, of, rome, aware, that, he, had, many, enemies, not, the, least, of, which, were, due, to, his, financial, reforms, eliminating, corruption, hannibal, fled, into, voluntary, exile, before, the, romans, could, demand, that, carthage, surrender, him, into, their, custody, he, journeyed, first, to, tyre, the, mother, city, of, carthage, and, then, to, antioch, before, he, finally, reached, ephesus, where, he, was, honourably, received, by, antiochus, livy, states, that, the, seleucid, king, consulted, hannibal, on, the, strategic, concerns, of, making, war, on, rome, according, to, cicero, while, at, the, court, of, antiochus, hannibal, attended, a, lecture, by, phormio, a, philosopher, that, ranged, through, many, topics, when, phormio, finished, a, discourse, on, the, duties, of, a, general, hannibal, was, asked, his, opinion, he, replied, i, have, seen, during, my, life, many, old, fools, but, this, one, beats, them, all, another, story, according, to, aulus, gellius, is, that, after, antiochus, iii, showed, hannibal, the, gigantic, and, elaborately, equipped, army, he, had, created, to, invade, greece, he, asked, him, if, they, would, be, enough, for, the, roman, republic, to, which, hannibal, replied, i, think, all, this, will, be, enough, yes, quite, enough, for, the, romans, even, though, they, are, most, avaricious, in, the, summer, of, 193, bc, tensions, flared, up, between, the, seleucids, and, rome, antiochus, gave, tacit, support, to, hannibal, s, plans, of, launching, an, anti, roman, coup, d, tat, in, carthage, yet, it, was, not, carried, out, the, carthaginian, general, also, advised, equipping, a, fleet, and, landing, a, body, of, troops, in, the, south, of, italy, offering, to, take, command, himself, in, 190, bc, after, having, suffered, a, series, of, defeats, in, the, roman, seleucid, war, antiochus, gave, hannibal, his, first, significant, military, command, after, spending, five, years, in, the, seleucid, court, hannibal, was, tasked, with, building, a, fleet, in, cilicia, from, scratch, although, phoenician, territories, like, tyre, and, sidon, possessed, the, necessary, combination, of, raw, materials, technical, expertise, and, experienced, personnel, it, took, much, longer, than, expected, for, it, to, be, completed, most, likely, due, to, wartime, shortages, in, july, 190, bc, hannibal, ordered, his, fleet, to, set, sail, from, seleucia, pieria, along, the, southern, asia, minor, coast, in, order, to, reinforce, the, rest, of, the,

of, hannibal, s, warships, through, the, diekplous, manoeuvre, forcing, him, to, retreat, hannibal, had, preserved, most, of, his, fleet, however, he, was, in, no, position, to, unite, with, polyxenidas, fleet, at, ephesus, since, his, ships, required, lengthy, repairs, the, ensuing, battle, of, myonessus, resulted, in, a, roman, rhodian, victory, which, cemented, roman, control, over,

resulted, in, a, decisive, roman, pergamene, victory, the, truce, was, signed, at, sardes, in, january, 189, bc, whereupon, antiochus, agreed, to, abandon, his, claims, on, all, lands, west, of, the, taurus, mountains, paid, a, heavy, war, indemnity, and, promised, to, hand, over, hannibal, and, other, notable, enemies, of, rome, from, among, his, allies, according, to, strabo, and, plutarch, hannibal, also, received, hospitality, at, the, armenian, royal, court, of, artaxias, i, the, authors, add, an, apocryphal, story, of, how, hannibal, planned, and, supervised, the, building, of, the, new, royal, capital, artaxata, suspicious, that, antiochus, was, prepared, to, surrender, him, to, the, romans, hannibal, fled, to, crete, but, he, soon, went, back, to, anatolia, and, sought, refuge, with, prusias, i, of, bithynia, who, was, engaged, in, warfare, with, rome, s, ally, king, eumenes, ii, of, pergamon, hannibal, went, on, to, serve, prusias, in, this, war, during, one, of, the, naval, victories, he, gained, over, eumenes, hannibal, had, large, pots, filled, with, venomous, snakes, thrown, onto, eumenes, ships, hannibal, also, went, on, to, defeat, eumenes, in, two, other, battles, on, land, at, this, stage, the, romans, intervened, and, threatened, bithynia, into, giving, up, hannibal, prusias, agreed, but, the, general, was, determined, not, to, fall, into, his, enemy, s, hands, the, precise, year, and, cause, of, hannibal, s, death, are, unknown, pausanias, wrote, that, hannibal, s, death, occurred, after, his, finger, was, wounded, by, his, drawn, sword, while, mounting, his, horse, resulting, in, a, fever, and, then, his, death, three, days, later, cornelius, nepos, and, livy, tell, a, different, story, namely, that, the, ex, consul, titus, quinctius, flamininus, on, discovering, that, hannibal, was, in, bithynia, went, there, in, an, embassy, to, demand, his, surrender, from, king, prusias, hannibal, discovering, that, the, castle, where, he, was, living, was, surrounded, by, roman, soldiers, and, he, could, not, escape, took, poison, appian, writes, that, it, was, prusias, who, poisoned, hannibal, pliny, the, elder, and, plutarch, in, his, life, of, flamininus, record, that, hannibal, s, tomb, was, at, libyssa, on, the, coast, of, the, sea, of, marmara, according, to, some, libyssa, was, sited, at, gebze, between, bursa, and, skudar, w, m, leake, identifying, gebze, with, ancient, dakibyza, placed, it, further, west, before, dying, hannibal, is, said, to, have, left, behind, a, letter, declaring, let, us, relieve, the, romans, from, the, anxiety, they, have, so, long, experienced, since, they, think, it, tries, their, patience, too, much, to, wait, for, an, old, man, s, death, appian, wrote, of, a, prophecy, about, hannibal, s, death, which, stated, that, libyssan, earth, shall, cover, hannibal, s, remains, this, he, wrote, made, hannibal, believe, that, he, would, die, in, libya, but, instead, it, was, at, the, bithynian, libyssa, that, he, would, die, in, his, annales, titus, pomponius, atticus, reports, that, hannibal, s, death, occurred, in, 183, bc, and, livy, implies, the, same, polybius, who, wrote, nearest, the, event, gives, 182, bc, sulpicius, blitho, records, the, death, under, 181, bc, hannibal, caused, great, distress, to, many, in, roman, society, he, became, such, a, figure, of, terror, that, whenever, disaster, threatened, romans, would, exclaim, hannibal, ad, portas, hannibal, is, at, the, gates, to, emphasize, the, gravity, of, the, emergency, a, phrase, still, used, in, modern, languages, his, legacy, would, be, recorded, by, his, greek, tutor, sosylus, of, lacedaemon, the, works, of, roman, writers, such, as, livy, 64, or, 59, bc, ad, 12, or, 17, frontinus, c, ad, 40, 103, and, juvenal, 1st, 2nd, century, ad, show, a, grudging, admiration, for, hannibal, the, romans, even, built, statues, of, the, carthaginian, in, the, streets, of, rome, to, advertise, their, defeat, of, such, a, worthy, adversary, it, is, plausible, to, suggest, that, hannibal, engendered, the, greatest, fear, rome, had, towards, an, enemy, nevertheless, the, romans, grimly, refused, to, admit, the, possibility, of, defeat, and, rejected, all, overtures, for, peace, they, even, refused, to, accept, the, ransom, of, prisoners, after, cannae, during, the, war, there, are, no, reports, of, revolutions, among, the, roman, citizens, no, factions, within, the, senate, desiring, peace, no, pro, carthaginian, roman, turncoats, and, no, coups, indeed, throughout, the, war, roman, aristocrats, ferociously, competed, with, each, other, for, positions, of, command, to, fight, against, rome, s, most, dangerous, enemy, hannibal, s, military, genius, was, not, enough, to, really, disturb, the, roman, political, process, and, the, collective, political, and, military, capacity, of, the, roman, people, as, lazenby, states, it, says, volumes, too, for, their, political, maturity, and, respect, for, constitutional, forms, that, the, complicated, machinery, of, government, continued, to, function, even, amidst, disaster, there, are, few, states, in, the, ancient, world, in, which, a, general, who, had, lost, a, battle, like, cannae, would, have, dared, to, remain, let, alone, would, have, continued, to, be, treated, respectfully, as, head, of, state, according, to, the, historian, livy, the, romans, feared, hannibal, s, military, genius, and, during, hannibal, s, march, against, rome, in, 211, bc, a, messenger, who, had, travelled, from, fregellae, for, a, day, and, a, night, without, stopping, created, great, alarm, in, rome, and, the, excitement, was, increased, by, people, running, about, the, city, with, wildly, exaggerated, accounts, of, the, news, he, had, brought, the, wailing, cry, of, the, matrons, was, heard, everywhere, not, only, in, private, houses, but, even, in, the, temples, here, they, knelt, and, swept, the, temple, floors, with, their, dishevelled, hair, and, lifted, up, their, hands, to, heaven, in, piteous, entreaty, to, the, gods, that, they, would, deliver, the, city, of, rome, out, of, the, hands, of, the, enemy, and, preserve, its, mothers, and, children, from, injury, and, outrage, in, the, senate, the, news, was, received, with, varying, feelings, as, men, s, temperaments, differed, so, it, was, decided, to, keep, capua, under, siege, but, to, send, 15, 000, infantry, and, 1, 000, cavalry, as, reinforcements, to, rome, according, to, livy, the, land, occupied, by, hannibal, s, army, outside, rome, in, 211, bc, was, sold, by, a, roman, while, it, was, occupied, this, may, not, be, true, but, as, lazenby, states, could, well, be, exemplifying, as, it, does, not, only, the, supreme, confidence, felt, by, the, romans, in, ultimate, victory, but, also, the, way, in, which, something, like, normal, life, continued, after, cannae, the, romans, showed, considerable, steadfastness, as, an, example, of, rome, s, confidence, after, the, cannae, disaster, she, was, left, virtually, defenseless, however, the, senate, still, chose, not, to, withdraw, a, single, garrison, from, an, overseas, province, to, strengthen, the, city, in, fact, they, were, reinforced, and, the, campaigns, there, maintained, until, victory, was, secured, beginning, first, in, sicily, under, the, direction, of, claudius, marcellus, and, later, in, hispania, under, scipio, africanus, although, the, long, term, consequences, of, hannibal, s, war, are, debatable, this, war, was, undeniably, rome, s, finest, hour, most, of, the, sources, available, to, historians, about, hannibal, are, from, romans, they, considered, him, the, greatest, enemy, rome, had, ever, faced, livy, gives, us, the, idea, that, hannibal, was, extremely, cruel, even, cicero, when, he, talked, of, rome, and, its, two, great, enemies, spoke, of, the, honourable, pyrrhus, and, the, cruel, hannibal, yet, a, different, picture, sometimes, emerges, when, hannibal, s, successes, had, brought, about, the, death, of, two, roman, consuls, he, vainly, searched, for, the, body, of, gaius, flaminius, on, the, shores, of, lake, trasimene, held, ceremonial, rituals, in, recognition, of, lucius, aemilius, paullus, and, sent, marcellus, ashes, back, to, his, family, in, rome, any, bias, attributed, to, polybius, however, is, more, troublesome, ronald, mellor, considered, the, greek, scholar, a, loyal, partisan, of, scipio, aemilianus, while, h, ormerod, does, not, view, him, as, an, altogether, unprejudiced, witness, when, it, came, to, his, pet, peeves, the, aetolians, the, carthaginians, and, the, cretans, nonetheless, polybius, did, recognize, that, the, reputation, for, cruelty, the, romans, attached, to, hannibal, might, in, reality, have, been, due, to, mistaking, him, for, one, of, his, officers, hannibal, monomachus, in, the, severan, period, hannibal, was, portrayed, as, a, successful, military, leader, from, history, who, could, serve, as, an, exemplary, figure, for, a, roman, audience, in, the, 13th, century, byzantine, scholar, john, tzetzes, wrote, that, severus, likely, septimius, severus, being, of, libyan, birth, constructed, a, tomb, of, white, marble, for, hannibal, in, libyssa, scholars, debate, whether, this, act, was, intended, to, promote, a, unified, north, african, identity, stimulate, local, economic, interests, or, link, severus, with, past, military, heroes, to, strengthen, his, legacy, reflecting, a, broader, severan, policy, of, honoring, local, traditions, and, historical, figures, hannibal, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, best, military, strategists, and, tacticians, of, all, time, the, double, envelopment, at, cannae, an, enduring, legacy, of, tactical, brilliance, according, to, appian, several, years, after, the, second, punic, war, hannibal, served, as, a, political, advisor, in, the, seleucid, kingdom, and, scipio, arrived, there, on, a, diplomatic, mission, from, rome, it, is, said, that, at, one, of, their, meetings, in, the, gymnasium, scipio, and, hannibal, had, a, conversation, on, the, subject, of, generalship, in, the, presence, of, a, number, of, bystanders, and, that, scipio, asked, hannibal, whom, he, considered, the, greatest, general, to, which, the, latter, replied, alexander, of, macedonia, to, this, scipio, assented, since, he, also, yielded, the, first, place, to, alexander, then, he, asked, hannibal, whom, he, placed, next, and, he, replied, pyrrhus, of, epirus, because, he, considered, boldness, the, first, qualification, of, a, general, for, it, would, not, be, possible, he, said, to, find, two, kings, more, enterprising, than, these, scipio, was, rather, nettled, by, this, but, nevertheless, he, asked, hannibal, to, whom, he, would, give, the, third, place, expecting, that, at, least, the, third, would, be, assigned, to, him, but, hannibal, replied, to, myself, for, when, i, was, a, young, man, i, conquered, hispania, and, crossed, the, alps, with, an, army, the, first, after, hercules, as, scipio, saw, that, he, was, likely, to, prolong, his, self, laudation, he, said, laughing, where, would, you, place, yourself, hannibal, if, you, had, not, been, defeated, by, me, hannibal, now, perceiving, his, jealousy, replied, in, that, case, i, should, have, put, myself, before, alexander, thus, hannibal, continued, his, self, laudation, but, flattered, scipio, in, an, indirect, manner, by, suggesting, that, he, had, conquered, one, who, was, the, superior, of, alexander, at, the, end, of, this, conversation, hannibal, invited, scipio, to, be, his, guest, and, scipio, replied, that, he, would, be, so, gladly, if, hannibal, were, not, living, with, antiochus, who, was, held, in, suspicion, by, the, romans, thus, did, they, in, a, manner, worthy, of, great, commanders, cast, aside, their, enmity, at, the, end, of, their, wars, military, academies, all, over, the, world, continue, to, study, hannibal, s, exploits, especially, his, victory, at, cannae, maximilian, otto, bismarck, caspari, in, his, article, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, eleventh, edition, 1910, 1911, praises, hannibal, in, these, words, as, to, the, transcendent, military, genius, of, hannibal, there, cannot, be, two, opinions, the, man, who, for, fifteen, years, could, hold, his, ground, in, a, hostile, country, against, several, powerful, armies, and, a, succession, of, able, generals, must, have, been, a, commander, and, a, tactician, of, supreme, capacity, in, the, use, of, strategies, and, ambuscades, he, certainly, surpassed, all, other, generals, of, antiquity, wonderful, as, his, achievements, were, we, must, marvel, the, more, when, we, take, into, account, the, grudging, support, he, received, from, carthage, as, his, veterans, melted, away, he, had, to, organize, fresh, levies, on, the, spot, we, never, hear, of, a, mutiny, in, his, army, composed, though, it, was, of, north, africans, iberians, and, gauls, again, all, we, know, of, him, comes, for, the, most, part, from, hostile, sources, the, romans, feared, and, hated, him, so, much, that, they, could, not, do, him, justice, livy, speaks, of, his, great, qualities, but, he, adds, that, his, vices, were, equally, great, among, which, he, singles, out, his, more, than, punic, perfidy, and, an, inhuman, cruelty, for, the, first, there, would, seem, to, be, no, further, justification, than, that, he, was, consummately, skillful, in, the, use, of, ambuscades, for, the, latter, there, is, we, believe, no, more, ground, than, that, at, certain, crises, he, acted, in, the, general, spirit, of, ancient, warfare, sometimes, he, contrasts, most, favorably, with, his, enemy, no, such, brutality, stains, his, name, as, that, perpetrated, by, gaius, claudius, nero, on, the, vanquished, hasdrubal, polybius, merely, says, that, he, was, accused, of, cruelty, by, the, romans, and, of, avarice, by, the, carthaginians, he, had, indeed, bitter, enemies, and, his, life, was, one, continuous, struggle, against, destiny, for, steadfastness, of, purpose, for, organizing, capacity, and, a, mastery, of, military, science, he, has, perhaps, never, had, an, equal, even, the, roman, chroniclers, acknowledged, hannibal, s, supreme, military, leadership, writing, that, he, never, required, others, to, do, what, he, could, not, and, would, not, do, himself, according, to, polybius, 23, 13, p, 423, it, is, a, remarkable, and, very, cogent, proof, of, hannibal, s, having, been, by, nature, a, real, leader, and, far, superior, to, anyone, else, in, statesmanship, that, though, he, spent, seventeen, years, in, the, field, passed, through, so, many, barbarous, countries, and, employed, to, aid, him, in, desperate, and, extraordinary, enterprises, numbers, of, men, of, different, nations, and, languages, no, one, ever, dreamt, of, conspiring, against, him, nor, was, he, ever, deserted, by, those, who, had, once, joined, him, or, submitted, to, him, count, alfred, von, schlieffen, developed, his, schlieffen, plan, 1905, 1906, from, his, military, studies, including, the, envelopment, technique, that, hannibal, employed, in, the, battle, of, cannae, george, s, patton, believed, himself, a, reincarnation, of, hannibal, as, well, as, of, many, other, people, including, a, roman, legionary, and, a, napoleonic, soldier, norman, schwarzkopf, jr, the, commander, of, the, coalition, of, the, gulf, war, of, 1990, 1991, claimed, the, technology, of, war, may, change, the, sophistication, of, weapons, certainly, changes, but, those, same, principles, of, war, that, applied, to, the, days, of, hannibal, apply, today, according, to, the, military, historian, theodore, ayrault, dodge, hannibal, excelled, as, a, tactician, no, battle, in, history, is, a, finer, sample, of, tactics, than, cannae, but, he, was, yet, greater, in, logistics, and, strategy, no, captain, ever, marched, to, and, fro, among, so, many, armies, of, troops, superior, to, his, own, numbers, and, material, as, fearlessly, and, skilfully, as, he, no, man, ever, held, his, own, so, long, or, so, ably, against, such, odds, constantly, overmatched, by, better, soldiers, led, by, generals, always, respectable, often, of, great, ability, he, yet, defied, all, their, efforts, to, drive, him, from, italy, for, half, a, generation, excepting, in, the, case, of, alexander, and, some, few, isolated, instances, all, wars, up, to, the, second, punic, war, had, been, decided, largely, if, not, entirely, by, battle, tactics, strategic, ability, had, been, comprehended, only, on, a, minor, scale, armies, had, marched, towards, each, other, had, fought, in, parallel, order, and, the, conqueror, had, imposed, terms, on, his, opponent, any, variation, from, this, rule, consisted, in, ambuscades, or, other, stratagems, that, war, could, be, waged, by, avoiding, in, lieu, of, seeking, battle, that, the, results, of, a, victory, could, be, earned, by, attacks, upon, the, enemy, s, communications, by, flank, manoeuvres, by, seizing, positions, from, which, safely, to, threaten, him, in, case, he, moved, and, by, other, devices, of, strategy, was, not, understood, for, the, first, time, in, the, history, of, war, we, see, two, contending, generals, avoiding, each, other, occupying, impregnable, camps, on, heights, marching, about, each, other, s, flanks, to, seize, cities, or, supplies, in, their, rear, harassing, each, other, with, small, war, and, rarely, venturing, on, a, battle, which, might, prove, a, fatal, disaster, all, with, a, well, conceived, purpose, of, placing, his, opponent, at, a, strategic, disadvantage, that, it, did, so, was, due, to, the, teaching, of, hannibal, due, to, his, origin, and, connection, with, the, territory, belonging, to, modern, day, tunisia, he, is, widely, revered, as, a, national, hero, in, the, arab, nation,
