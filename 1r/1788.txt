baron, augustin, louis, cauchy, frs, frse, uk, k, o, i, koh, shee, k, a, i, kow, shee, us, k, o, i, koh, shee, french, 21, august, 1789, 23, may, 1857, was, a, french, mathematician, engineer, and, physicist, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, rigorously, state, and, prove, the, key, theorems, of, calculus, thereby, creating, real, analysis, pioneered, the, field, complex, analysis, and, the, study, of, permutation, groups, in, abstract, algebra, cauchy, also, contributed, to, a, number, of, topics, in, mathematical, physics, notably, continuum, mechanics, a, profound, mathematician, cauchy, had, a, great, influence, over, his, contemporaries, and, successors, hans, freudenthal, stated, cauchy, was, a, prolific, worker, he, wrote, approximately, eight, hundred, research, articles, and, five, complete, textbooks, on, a, variety, of, topics, in, the, fields, of, mathematics, and, mathematical, physics, cauchy, was, the, son, of, louis, fran, ois, cauchy, 1760, 1848, and, marie, madeleine, desestre, cauchy, had, two, brothers, alexandre, laurent, cauchy, 1792, 1857, who, became, a, president, of, a, division, of, the, court, of, appeal, in, 1847, and, a, judge, of, the, court, of, cassation, in, 1849, and, eugene, fran, ois, cauchy, 1802, 1877, a, publicist, who, also, wrote, several, mathematical, works, from, his, childhood, he, was, good, at, math, cauchy, married, aloise, de, bure, in, 1818, she, was, a, close, relative, of, the, publisher, who, published, most, of, cauchy, s, works, they, had, two, daughters, marie, fran, oise, alicia, 1819, and, marie, mathilde, 1823, cauchy, s, father, was, a, highly, ranked, official, in, the, parisian, police, of, the, ancien, r, gime, but, lost, this, position, due, to, the, french, revolution, 14, july, 1789, which, broke, out, one, month, before, augustin, louis, was, born, the, cauchy, family, survived, the, revolution, and, the, following, reign, of, terror, during, 1793, 94, by, escaping, to, arcueil, where, cauchy, received, his, first, education, from, his, father, after, the, execution, of, robespierre, in, 1794, it, was, safe, for, the, family, to, return, to, paris, there, louis, fran, ois, cauchy, found, a, bureaucratic, job, in, 1800, and, quickly, advanced, his, career, when, napoleon, came, to, power, in, 1799, louis, fran, ois, cauchy, was, further, promoted, and, became, secretary, general, of, the, senate, working, directly, under, laplace, who, is, now, better, known, for, his, work, on, mathematical, physics, the, mathematician, lagrange, was, also, a, friend, of, the, cauchy, family, on, lagrange, s, advice, augustin, louis, was, enrolled, in, the, cole, centrale, du, panth, on, the, best, secondary, school, of, paris, at, that, time, in, the, fall, of, 1802, most, of, the, curriculum, consisted, of, classical, languages, the, ambitious, cauchy, being, a, brilliant, student, won, many, prizes, in, latin, and, the, humanities, in, spite, of, these, successes, cauchy, chose, an, engineering, career, and, prepared, himself, for, the, entrance, examination, to, the, cole, polytechnique, in, 1805, he, placed, second, of, 293, applicants, on, this, exam, and, was, admitted, one, of, the, main, purposes, of, this, school, was, to, give, future, civil, and, military, engineers, a, high, level, scientific, and, mathematical, education, the, school, functioned, under, military, discipline, which, caused, cauchy, some, problems, in, adapting, nevertheless, he, completed, the, course, in, 1807, at, age, 18, and, went, on, to, the, cole, des, ponts, et, chauss, es, school, for, bridges, and, roads, he, graduated, in, civil, engineering, with, the, highest, honors, after, finishing, school, in, 1810, cauchy, accepted, a, job, as, a, junior, engineer, in, cherbourg, where, napoleon, intended, to, build, a, naval, base, here, cauchy, stayed, for, three, years, and, was, assigned, the, ourcq, canal, project, and, the, saint, cloud, bridge, project, and, worked, at, the, harbor, of, cherbourg, although, he, had, an, extremely, busy, managerial, job, he, still, found, time, to, prepare, three, mathematical, manuscripts, which, he, submitted, to, the, premi, re, classe, first, class, of, the, institut, de, france, cauchy, s, first, two, manuscripts, on, polyhedra, were, accepted, the, third, one, on, directrices, of, conic, sections, was, rejected, in, september, 1812, at, 23, years, old, cauchy, returned, to, paris, after, becoming, ill, from, overwork, another, reason, for, his, return, to, the, capital, was, that, he, was, losing, interest, in, his, engineering, job, being, more, and, more, attracted, to, the, abstract, beauty, of, mathematics, in, paris, he, would, have, a, much, better, chance, to, find, a, mathematics, related, position, when, his, health, improved, in, 1813, cauchy, chose, not, to, return, to, cherbourg, although, he, formally, kept, his, engineering, position, he, was, transferred, from, the, payroll, of, the, ministry, of, the, marine, to, the, ministry, of, the, interior, the, next, three, years, cauchy, was, mainly, on, unpaid, sick, leave, he, spent, his, time, fruitfully, working, on, mathematics, on, the, related, topics, of, symmetric, functions, the, symmetric, group, and, the, theory, of, higher, order, algebraic, equations, he, attempted, admission, to, the, first, class, of, the, institut, de, france, but, failed, on, three, different, occasions, between, 1813, and, 1815, in, 1815, napoleon, was, defeated, at, waterloo, and, the, newly, installed, king, louis, xviii, took, the, restoration, in, hand, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, was, re, established, in, march, 1816, lazare, carnot, and, gaspard, monge, were, removed, from, this, academy, for, political, reasons, and, the, king, appointed, cauchy, to, take, the, place, of, one, of, them, the, reaction, of, cauchy, s, peers, was, harsh, they, considered, the, acceptance, of, his, membership, in, the, academy, an, outrage, and, cauchy, created, many, enemies, in, scientific, circles, in, november, 1815, louis, poinsot, who, was, an, associate, professor, at, the, cole, polytechnique, asked, to, be, exempted, from, his, teaching, duties, for, health, reasons, cauchy, was, by, then, a, rising, mathematical, star, one, of, his, great, successes, at, that, time, was, the, proof, of, fermat, s, polygonal, number, theorem, he, quit, his, engineering, job, and, received, a, one, year, contract, for, teaching, mathematics, to, second, year, students, of, the, cole, polytechnique, in, 1816, this, bonapartist, non, religious, school, was, reorganized, and, several, liberal, professors, were, fired, cauchy, was, promoted, to, full, professor, when, cauchy, was, 28, years, old, he, was, still, living, with, his, parents, his, father, found, it, time, for, his, son, to, marry, he, found, him, a, suitable, bride, alo, se, de, bure, five, years, his, junior, the, de, bure, family, were, printers, and, booksellers, and, published, most, of, cauchy, s, works, alo, se, and, augustin, were, married, on, april, 4, 1818, with, great, roman, catholic, ceremony, in, the, church, of, saint, sulpice, in, 1819, the, couple, s, first, daughter, marie, fran, oise, alicia, was, born, and, in, 1823, the, second, and, last, daughter, marie, mathilde, the, conservative, political, climate, that, lasted, until, 1830, suited, cauchy, perfectly, in, 1824, louis, xviii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, even, more, conservative, brother, charles, x, during, these, years, cauchy, was, highly, productive, and, published, one, important, mathematical, treatise, after, another, he, received, cross, appointments, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, and, the, facult, des, sciences, de, paris, in, july, 1830, the, july, revolution, occurred, in, france, charles, x, fled, the, country, and, was, succeeded, by, louis, philippe, riots, in, which, uniformed, students, of, the, cole, polytechnique, took, an, active, part, raged, close, to, cauchy, s, home, in, paris, these, events, marked, a, turning, point, in, cauchy, s, life, and, a, break, in, his, mathematical, productivity, shaken, by, the, fall, of, the, government, and, moved, by, a, deep, hatred, of, the, liberals, who, were, taking, power, cauchy, left, france, to, go, abroad, leaving, his, family, behind, he, spent, a, short, time, at, fribourg, in, switzerland, where, he, had, to, decide, whether, he, would, swear, a, required, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, new, regime, he, refused, to, do, this, and, consequently, lost, all, his, positions, in, paris, except, his, membership, of, the, academy, for, which, an, oath, was, not, required, in, 1831, cauchy, went, to, the, italian, city, of, turin, and, after, some, time, there, he, accepted, an, offer, from, the, king, of, sardinia, who, ruled, turin, and, the, surrounding, piedmont, region, for, a, chair, of, theoretical, physics, which, was, created, especially, for, him, he, taught, in, turin, during, 1832, 1833, in, 1831, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, and, the, following, year, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, august, 1833, cauchy, left, turin, for, prague, to, become, the, science, tutor, of, the, thirteen, year, old, duke, of, bordeaux, henri, d, artois, 1820, 1883, the, exiled, crown, prince, and, grandson, of, charles, x, as, a, professor, of, the, cole, polytechnique, cauchy, had, been, a, notoriously, bad, lecturer, assuming, levels, of, understanding, that, only, a, few, of, his, best, students, could, reach, and, cramming, his, allotted, time, with, too, much, material, henri, d, artois, had, neither, taste, nor, talent, for, either, mathematics, or, science, although, cauchy, took, his, mission, very, seriously, he, did, this, with, great, clumsiness, and, with, surprising, lack, of, authority, over, henri, d, artois, during, his, civil, engineering, days, cauchy, once, had, been, briefly, in, charge, of, repairing, a, few, of, the, parisian, sewers, and, he, made, the, mistake, of, mentioning, this, to, his, pupil, with, great, malice, henri, d, artois, went, about, saying, cauchy, started, his, career, in, the, sewers, of, paris, cauchy, s, role, as, tutor, lasted, until, henri, d, artois, became, eighteen, years, old, in, september, 1838, cauchy, did, hardly, any, research, during, those, five, years, while, henri, d, artois, acquired, a, lifelong, dislike, of, mathematics, cauchy, was, named, a, baron, a, title, by, which, cauchy, set, great, store, in, 1834, his, wife, and, two, daughters, moved, to, prague, and, cauchy, was, reunited, with, his, family, after, four, years, in, exile, cauchy, returned, to, paris, and, his, position, at, the, academy, of, sciences, late, in, 1838, he, could, not, regain, his, teaching, positions, because, he, still, refused, to, swear, an, oath, of, allegiance, in, august, 1839, a, vacancy, appeared, in, the, bureau, des, longitudes, this, bureau, bore, some, resemblance, to, the, academy, for, instance, it, had, the, right, to, co, opt, its, members, further, it, was, believed, that, members, of, the, bureau, could, forget, about, the, oath, of, allegiance, although, formally, unlike, the, academicians, they, were, obliged, to, take, it, the, bureau, des, longitudes, was, an, organization, founded, in, 1795, to, solve, the, problem, of, determining, position, at, sea, mainly, the, longitudinal, coordinate, since, latitude, is, easily, determined, from, the, position, of, the, sun, since, it, was, thought, that, position, at, sea, was, best, determined, by, astronomical, observations, the, bureau, had, developed, into, an, organization, resembling, an, academy, of, astronomical, sciences, in, november, 1839, cauchy, was, elected, to, the, bureau, and, discovered, that, the, matter, of, the, oath, was, not, so, easily, dispensed, with, without, his, oath, the, king, refused, to, approve, his, election, for, four, years, cauchy, was, in, the, position, of, being, elected, but, not, approved, accordingly, he, was, not, a, formal, member, of, the, bureau, did, not, receive, payment, could, not, participate, in, meetings, and, could, not, submit, papers, still, cauchy, refused, to, take, any, oaths, however, he, did, feel, loyal, enough, to, direct, his, research, to, celestial, mechanics, in, 1840, he, presented, a, dozen, papers, on, this, topic, to, the, academy, he, described, and, illustrated, the, signed, digit, representation, of, numbers, an, innovation, presented, in, england, in, 1727, by, john, colson, the, confounded, membership, of, the, bureau, lasted, until, the, end, of, 1843, when, cauchy, was, replaced, by, poinsot, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, the, french, educational, system, struggled, over, the, separation, of, church, and, state, after, losing, control, of, the, public, education, system, the, catholic, church, sought, to, establish, its, own, branch, of, education, and, found, in, cauchy, a, staunch, and, illustrious, ally, he, lent, his, prestige, and, knowledge, to, the, cole, normale, ccl, siastique, a, school, in, paris, run, by, jesuits, for, training, teachers, for, their, colleges, he, took, part, in, the, founding, of, the, institut, catholique, the, purpose, of, this, institute, was, to, counter, the, effects, of, the, absence, of, catholic, university, education, in, france, these, activities, did, not, make, cauchy, popular, with, his, colleagues, who, on, the, whole, supported, the, enlightenment, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, when, a, chair, of, mathematics, became, vacant, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, 1843, cauchy, applied, for, it, but, received, just, three, of, 45, votes, in, 1848, king, louis, philippe, fled, to, england, the, oath, of, allegiance, was, abolished, and, the, road, to, an, academic, appointment, was, clear, for, cauchy, on, march, 1, 1849, he, was, reinstated, at, the, facult, de, sciences, as, a, professor, of, mathematical, astronomy, after, political, turmoil, all, through, 1848, france, chose, to, become, a, republic, under, the, presidency, of, napoleon, iii, of, france, early, 1852, the, president, made, himself, emperor, of, france, and, took, the, name, napoleon, iii, the, idea, came, up, in, bureaucratic, circles, that, it, would, be, useful, to, again, require, a, loyalty, oath, from, all, state, functionaries, including, university, professors, this, time, a, cabinet, minister, was, able, to, convince, the, emperor, to, exempt, cauchy, from, the, oath, in, 1853, cauchy, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, cauchy, remained, a, professor, at, the, university, until, his, death, at, the, age, of, 67, he, received, the, last, rites, and, died, of, a, bronchial, condition, at, 4, a, m, on, 23, may, 1857, his, name, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, the, genius, of, cauchy, was, illustrated, in, his, simple, solution, of, the, problem, of, apollonius, describing, a, circle, touching, three, given, circles, which, he, discovered, in, 1805, his, generalization, of, euler, s, formula, on, polyhedra, in, 1811, and, in, several, other, elegant, problems, more, important, is, his, memoir, on, wave, propagation, which, obtained, the, grand, prix, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1816, cauchy, s, writings, covered, notable, topics, in, the, theory, of, series, he, developed, the, notion, of, convergence, and, discovered, many, of, the, basic, formulas, for, q, series, in, the, theory, of, numbers, and, complex, quantities, he, was, the, first, to, define, complex, numbers, as, pairs, of, real, numbers, he, also, wrote, on, the, theory, of, groups, and, substitutions, the, theory, of, functions, differential, equations, and, determinants, in, the, theory, of, light, he, worked, on, fresnel, s, wave, theory, and, on, the, dispersion, and, polarization, of, light, he, also, contributed, research, in, mechanics, substituting, the, notion, of, the, continuity, of, geometrical, displacements, for, the, principle, of, the, continuity, of, matter, he, wrote, on, the, equilibrium, of, rods, and, elastic, membranes, and, on, waves, in, elastic, media, he, introduced, a, 3, 3, symmetric, matrix, of, numbers, that, is, now, known, as, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, in, elasticity, he, originated, the, theory, of, stress, and, his, results, are, nearly, as, valuable, as, those, of, sim, on, poisson, other, significant, contributions, include, being, the, first, to, prove, the, fermat, polygonal, number, theorem, cauchy, is, most, famous, for, his, single, handed, development, of, complex, function, theory, the, first, pivotal, theorem, proved, by, cauchy, now, known, as, cauchy, s, integral, theorem, was, the, following, where, f, z, is, a, complex, valued, function, holomorphic, on, and, within, the, non, self, intersecting, closed, curve, c, contour, lying, in, the, complex, plane, the, contour, integral, is, taken, along, the, contour, c, the, rudiments, of, this, theorem, can, already, be, found, in, a, paper, that, the, 24, year, old, cauchy, presented, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, then, still, called, first, class, of, the, institute, on, august, 11, 1814, in, full, form, the, theorem, was, given, in, 1825, in, 1826, cauchy, gave, a, formal, definition, of, a, residue, of, a, function, this, concept, concerns, functions, that, have, poles, isolated, singularities, i, e, points, where, a, function, goes, to, positive, or, negative, infinity, if, the, complex, valued, function, f, z, can, be, expanded, in, the, neighborhood, of, a, singularity, a, as, where, z, is, analytic, i, e, well, behaved, without, singularities, then, f, is, said, to, have, a, pole, of, order, n, in, the, point, a, if, n, 1, the, pole, is, called, simple, the, coefficient, b, 1, is, called, by, cauchy, the, residue, of, function, f, at, a, if, f, is, non, singular, at, a, then, the, residue, of, f, is, zero, at, a, clearly, the, residue, is, in, the, case, of, a, simple, pole, equal, to, where, we, replaced, b, 1, by, the, modern, notation, of, the, residue, in, 1831, while, in, turin, cauchy, submitted, two, papers, to, the, academy, of, sciences, of, turin, in, the, first, he, proposed, the, formula, now, known, as, cauchy, s, integral, formula, where, f, z, is, analytic, on, c, and, within, the, region, bounded, by, the, contour, c, and, the, complex, number, a, is, somewhere, in, this, region, the, contour, integral, is, taken, counter, clockwise, clearly, the, integrand, has, a, simple, pole, at, z, a, in, the, second, paper, he, presented, the, residue, theorem, where, the, sum, is, over, all, the, n, poles, of, f, z, on, and, within, the, contour, c, these, results, of, cauchy, s, still, form, the, core, of, complex, function, theory, as, it, is, taught, today, to, physicists, and, electrical, engineers, for, quite, some, time, contemporaries, of, cauchy, ignored, his, theory, believing, it, to, be, too, complicated, only, in, the, 1840s, the, theory, started, to, get, response, with, pierre, alphonse, laurent, being, the, first, mathematician, besides, cauchy, to, make, a, substantial, contribution, his, work, on, what, are, now, known, as, laurent, series, published, in, 1843, in, his, book, cours, d, analyse, cauchy, stressed, the, importance, of, rigor, in, analysis, rigor, in, this, case, meant, the, rejection, of, the, principle, of, generality, of, algebra, of, earlier, authors, such, as, euler, and, lagrange, and, its, replacement, by, geometry, and, infinitesimals, judith, grabiner, wrote, cauchy, was, the, man, who, taught, rigorous, analysis, to, all, of, europe, the, book, is, frequently, noted, as, being, the, first, place, that, inequalities, and, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, arguments, were, introduced, into, calculus, here, cauchy, defined, continuity, as, follows, the, function, f, x, is, continuous, with, respect, to, x, between, the, given, limits, if, between, these, limits, an, infinitely, small, increment, in, the, variable, always, produces, an, infinitely, small, increment, in, the, function, itself, m, barany, claims, that, the, cole, mandated, the, inclusion, of, infinitesimal, methods, against, cauchy, s, better, judgement, gilain, notes, that, when, the, portion, of, the, curriculum, devoted, to, analyse, alg, brique, was, reduced, in, 1825, cauchy, insisted, on, placing, the, topic, of, continuous, functions, and, therefore, also, infinitesimals, at, the, beginning, of, the, differential, calculus, laugwitz, 1989, and, benis, sinaceur, 1973, point, out, that, cauchy, continued, to, use, infinitesimals, in, his, own, research, as, late, as, 1853, cauchy, gave, an, explicit, definition, of, an, infinitesimal, in, terms, of, a, sequence, tending, to, zero, there, has, been, a, vast, body, of, literature, written, about, cauchy, s, notion, of, infinitesimally, small, quantities, arguing, that, they, lead, from, everything, from, the, usual, epsilontic, definitions, or, to, the, notions, of, non, standard, analysis, the, consensus, is, that, cauchy, omitted, or, left, implicit, the, important, ideas, to, make, clear, the, precise, meaning, of, the, infinitely, small, quantities, he, used, he, was, the, first, to, prove, taylor, s, theorem, rigorously, establishing, his, well, known, form, of, the, remainder, he, wrote, a, textbook, see, the, illustration, for, his, students, at, the, cole, polytechnique, in, which, he, developed, the, basic, theorems, of, mathematical, analysis, as, rigorously, as, possible, in, this, book, he, gave, the, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, for, the, existence, of, a, limit, in, the, form, that, is, still, taught, also, cauchy, s, well, known, test, for, absolute, convergence, stems, from, this, book, cauchy, condensation, test, in, 1829, he, defined, for, the, first, time, a, complex, function, of, a, complex, variable, in, another, textbook, in, spite, of, these, cauchy, s, own, research, papers, often, used, intuitive, not, rigorous, methods, thus, one, of, his, theorems, was, exposed, to, a, counter, example, by, abel, later, fixed, by, the, introduction, of, the, notion, of, uniform, continuity, in, a, paper, published, in, 1855, two, years, before, cauchy, s, death, he, discussed, some, theorems, one, of, which, is, similar, to, the, principle, of, the, argument, in, many, modern, textbooks, on, complex, analysis, in, modern, control, theory, textbooks, the, cauchy, argument, principle, is, quite, frequently, used, to, derive, the, nyquist, stability, criterion, which, can, be, used, to, predict, the, stability, of, negative, feedback, amplifier, and, negative, feedback, control, systems, thus, cauchy, s, work, has, a, strong, impact, on, both, pure, mathematics, and, practical, engineering, cauchy, was, very, productive, in, number, of, papers, second, only, to, leonhard, euler, it, took, almost, a, century, to, collect, all, his, writings, into, 27, large, volumes, his, greatest, contributions, to, mathematical, science, are, enveloped, in, the, rigorous, methods, which, he, introduced, these, are, mainly, embodied, in, his, three, great, treatises, his, other, works, include, augustin, louis, cauchy, grew, up, in, the, house, of, a, staunch, royalist, this, made, his, father, flee, with, the, family, to, arcueil, during, the, french, revolution, their, life, there, during, that, time, was, apparently, hard, augustin, louis, s, father, louis, fran, ois, spoke, of, living, on, rice, bread, and, crackers, during, the, period, a, paragraph, from, an, undated, letter, from, louis, fran, ois, to, his, mother, in, rouen, says, we, never, had, more, than, a, one, half, pound, 230, g, of, bread, and, sometimes, not, even, that, this, we, supplement, with, little, supply, of, hard, crackers, and, rice, that, we, are, allotted, otherwise, we, are, getting, along, quite, well, which, is, the, important, thing, and, goes, to, show, that, human, beings, can, get, by, with, little, i, should, tell, you, that, for, my, children, s, pap, i, still, have, a, bit, of, fine, flour, made, from, wheat, that, i, grew, on, my, own, land, i, had, three, bushels, and, i, also, have, a, few, pounds, of, potato, starch,
