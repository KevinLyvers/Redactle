sir, ronald, aylmer, fisher, frs, 17, february, 1890, 29, july, 1962, was, a, british, polymath, who, was, active, as, a, mathematician, statistician, biologist, geneticist, and, academic, for, his, work, in, statistics, he, has, been, described, as, a, genius, who, almost, single, handedly, created, the, foundations, for, modern, statistical, science, and, the, single, most, important, figure, in, 20th, century, statistics, in, genetics, fisher, was, the, one, to, most, comprehensively, combine, the, ideas, of, gregor, mendel, and, charles, darwin, as, his, work, used, mathematics, to, combine, mendelian, genetics, and, natural, selection, this, contributed, to, the, revival, of, darwinism, in, the, early, 20th, century, revision, of, the, theory, of, evolution, known, as, the, modern, synthesis, for, his, contributions, to, biology, richard, dawkins, declared, fisher, to, be, the, greatest, of, darwin, s, successors, he, is, also, considered, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, neo, darwinism, according, to, statistician, jeffrey, t, leek, fisher, is, the, most, influential, scientist, of, all, time, based, off, the, number, of, citations, of, his, contributions, from, 1919, he, worked, at, the, rothamsted, experimental, station, for, 14, years, there, he, analyzed, its, immense, body, of, data, from, crop, experiments, since, the, 1840s, and, developed, the, analysis, of, variance, anova, he, established, his, reputation, there, in, the, following, years, as, a, biostatistician, fisher, also, made, fundamental, contributions, to, multivariate, statistics, fisher, founded, quantitative, genetics, and, together, with, j, b, s, haldane, and, sewall, wright, is, known, as, one, of, the, three, principal, founders, of, population, genetics, fisher, outlined, fisher, s, principle, the, fisherian, runaway, the, sexy, son, hypothesis, theories, of, sexual, selection, parental, investment, and, also, pioneered, linkage, analysis, and, gene, mapping, on, the, other, hand, as, the, founder, of, modern, statistics, fisher, made, countless, contributions, including, creating, the, modern, method, of, maximum, likelihood, and, deriving, the, properties, of, maximum, likelihood, estimators, fiducial, inference, the, derivation, of, various, sampling, distributions, founding, the, principles, of, the, design, of, experiments, and, much, more, fisher, s, famous, 1921, paper, alone, has, been, described, as, arguably, the, most, influential, article, on, mathematical, statistics, in, the, twentieth, century, and, equivalent, to, darwin, on, evolutionary, biology, gauss, on, number, theory, kolmogorov, on, probability, and, adam, smith, on, economics, and, is, credited, with, completely, revolutionizing, statistics, due, to, his, influence, and, numerous, fundamental, contributions, he, has, been, described, as, the, most, original, evolutionary, biologist, of, the, twentieth, century, and, as, the, greatest, statistician, of, all, time, his, work, is, further, credited, with, later, initiating, the, human, genome, project, fisher, also, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, human, blood, groups, fisher, has, also, been, praised, as, a, pioneer, of, the, information, age, his, work, on, a, mathematical, theory, of, information, ran, parallel, to, the, work, of, claude, shannon, and, norbert, wiener, though, based, on, statistical, theory, a, concept, to, have, come, out, of, his, work, is, that, of, fisher, information, he, also, had, ideas, about, social, sciences, which, have, been, described, as, a, foundation, for, evolutionary, social, sciences, fisher, held, strong, views, on, race, and, eugenics, insisting, on, racial, differences, although, he, was, clearly, a, eugenicist, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, fisher, supported, scientific, racism, see, ronald, fisher, views, on, race, he, was, the, galton, professor, of, eugenics, at, university, college, london, and, editor, of, the, annals, of, eugenics, fisher, was, born, in, east, finchley, in, london, england, into, a, middle, class, household, his, father, george, was, a, successful, partner, in, robinson, fisher, auctioneers, and, fine, art, dealers, he, was, one, of, twins, with, the, other, twin, being, still, born, and, grew, up, the, youngest, with, three, sisters, and, one, brother, from, 1896, until, 1904, they, lived, at, inverforth, house, in, london, where, english, heritage, installed, a, blue, plaque, in, 2002, before, moving, to, streatham, his, mother, kate, died, from, acute, peritonitis, when, he, was, 14, and, his, father, lost, his, business, 18, months, later, lifelong, poor, eyesight, caused, his, rejection, by, the, british, army, for, world, war, i, but, also, developed, his, ability, to, visualize, problems, in, geometrical, terms, not, in, writing, mathematical, solutions, or, proofs, he, entered, harrow, school, age, 14, and, won, the, school, s, neeld, medal, in, mathematics, in, 1909, he, won, a, scholarship, to, study, mathematics, at, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, in, 1912, he, gained, a, first, in, mathematics, in, 1915, he, published, a, paper, the, evolution, of, sexual, preference, on, sexual, selection, and, mate, choice, during, 1913, 1919, fisher, worked, as, a, statistician, in, the, city, of, london, and, taught, physics, and, maths, at, a, sequence, of, public, schools, at, the, thames, nautical, training, college, and, at, bradfield, college, there, he, settled, with, his, new, bride, eileen, guinness, with, whom, he, had, two, sons, and, six, daughters, in, 1918, he, published, the, correlation, between, relatives, on, the, supposition, of, mendelian, inheritance, in, which, he, introduced, the, term, variance, and, proposed, its, formal, analysis, he, put, forward, a, genetics, conceptual, model, showing, that, continuous, variation, amongst, phenotypic, traits, measured, by, biostatisticians, could, be, produced, by, the, combined, action, of, many, discrete, genes, and, thus, be, the, result, of, mendelian, inheritance, this, was, the, first, step, towards, establishing, population, genetics, and, quantitative, genetics, which, demonstrated, that, natural, selection, could, change, allele, frequencies, in, a, population, reconciling, its, discontinuous, nature, with, gradual, evolution, joan, box, fisher, s, biographer, and, daughter, says, that, fisher, had, resolved, this, problem, already, in, 1911, today, fisher, s, additive, model, is, still, regularly, used, in, genome, wide, association, studies, in, 1919, he, began, working, at, the, rothamsted, experimental, station, in, hertfordshire, where, he, would, remain, for, 14, years, he, had, been, offered, a, position, at, the, galton, laboratory, in, university, college, london, led, by, karl, pearson, but, instead, accepted, a, temporary, role, at, rothamsted, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, analysing, the, vast, amount, of, crop, data, accumulated, since, 1842, from, the, classical, field, experiments, he, analysed, the, data, recorded, over, many, years, and, in, 1921, published, studies, in, crop, variation, i, his, first, application, of, the, analysis, of, variance, anova, studies, in, crop, variation, ii, written, with, his, first, assistant, winifred, mackenzie, became, the, model, for, later, anova, work, later, assistants, who, mastered, and, propagated, fisher, s, methods, were, joseph, oscar, irwin, john, wishart, and, frank, yates, between, 1912, and, 1922, fisher, recommended, analyzed, with, heuristic, proofs, and, vastly, popularized, the, maximum, likelihood, estimation, method, fisher, s, 1924, article, on, a, distribution, yielding, the, error, functions, of, several, well, known, statistics, presented, pearson, s, chi, squared, test, and, william, gosset, s, student, s, t, distribution, in, the, same, framework, as, the, gaussian, distribution, and, is, where, he, developed, fisher, s, z, distribution, a, new, statistical, method, commonly, used, decades, later, as, the, f, distribution, he, pioneered, the, principles, of, the, design, of, experiments, and, the, statistics, of, small, samples, and, the, analysis, of, real, data, in, 1925, he, published, statistical, methods, for, research, workers, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, most, influential, books, on, statistical, methods, fisher, s, method, is, a, technique, for, data, fusion, or, meta, analysis, analysis, of, analyses, fisher, formalized, and, popularized, use, of, the, p, value, in, statistics, which, plays, a, central, role, in, his, approach, fisher, proposes, the, level, p, 0, 05, or, a, 1, in, 20, chance, of, being, exceeded, by, chance, as, a, limit, for, statistical, significance, and, applies, this, to, a, normal, distribution, as, a, two, tailed, test, yielding, the, rule, of, two, standard, deviations, on, a, normal, distribution, for, statistical, significance, the, significance, of, 1, 96, the, approximate, value, of, the, 97, 5, percentile, point, of, the, normal, distribution, used, in, probability, and, statistics, also, originated, in, this, book, the, value, for, which, p, 0, 05, or, 1, in, 20, is, 1, 96, or, nearly, 2, it, is, convenient, to, take, this, point, as, a, limit, in, judging, whether, a, deviation, is, to, be, considered, significant, or, not, in, table, 1, of, the, work, he, gave, the, more, precise, value, 1, 959964, in, 1928, fisher, was, the, first, to, use, diffusion, equations, to, attempt, to, calculate, the, distribution, of, allele, frequencies, and, the, estimation, of, genetic, linkage, by, maximum, likelihood, methods, among, populations, in, 1930, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, was, first, published, by, clarendon, press, and, is, dedicated, to, leonard, darwin, a, core, work, of, the, neo, darwinian, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, it, helped, define, population, genetics, which, fisher, founded, alongside, sewall, wright, and, j, b, s, haldane, and, revived, darwin, s, neglected, idea, of, sexual, selection, one, of, fisher, s, favourite, aphorisms, was, natural, selection, is, a, mechanism, for, generating, an, exceedingly, high, degree, of, improbability, fisher, s, fame, grew, and, he, began, to, travel, and, lecture, widely, in, 1931, he, spent, six, weeks, at, the, statistical, laboratory, at, iowa, state, college, where, he, gave, three, lectures, per, week, and, met, many, american, statisticians, including, george, w, snedecor, he, returned, there, again, in, 1936, in, 1933, fisher, became, the, head, of, the, department, of, eugenics, at, university, college, london, in, 1934, he, become, editor, of, the, annals, of, eugenics, now, called, annals, of, human, genetics, in, 1935, he, published, the, design, of, experiments, which, was, also, fundamental, statistical, technique, and, application, the, mathematical, justification, of, the, methods, was, not, stressed, and, proofs, were, often, barely, sketched, or, omitted, altogether, led, h, b, mann, to, fill, the, gaps, with, a, rigorous, mathematical, treatment, in, this, book, fisher, also, outlined, the, lady, tasting, tea, now, a, famous, design, of, a, statistical, randomized, experiment, which, uses, fisher, s, exact, test, and, is, the, original, exposition, of, fisher, s, notion, of, a, null, hypothesis, the, same, year, he, also, published, a, paper, on, fiducial, inference, and, applied, it, to, the, behrens, fisher, problem, the, solution, to, which, proposed, first, by, walter, behrens, and, a, few, years, later, by, fisher, is, the, behrens, fisher, distribution, in, 1936, he, introduced, the, iris, flower, data, set, as, an, example, of, discriminant, analysis, in, his, 1937, paper, the, wave, of, advance, of, advantageous, genes, he, proposed, fisher, s, equation, in, the, context, of, population, dynamics, to, describe, the, spatial, spread, of, an, advantageous, allele, and, explored, its, travelling, wave, solutions, out, of, this, also, came, the, fisher, kolmogorov, equation, in, 1937, he, visited, the, indian, statistical, institute, in, calcutta, and, its, one, part, time, employee, p, c, mahalanobis, often, returning, to, encourage, its, development, he, was, the, guest, of, honour, at, its, 25th, anniversary, in, 1957, when, it, had, 2000, employees, in, 1938, fisher, and, frank, yates, described, the, fisher, yates, shuffle, in, their, book, statistical, tables, for, biological, agricultural, and, medical, research, their, description, of, the, algorithm, used, pencil, and, paper, a, table, of, random, numbers, provided, the, randomness, in, 1943, along, with, a, s, corbet, and, c, b, williams, he, published, a, paper, on, relative, species, abundance, where, he, developed, the, log, series, distribution, sometimes, called, the, logarithmic, distribution, to, fit, two, different, abundance, data, sets, in, the, same, year, he, took, the, balfour, chair, of, genetics, where, the, italian, researcher, luigi, luca, cavalli, sforza, was, recruited, in, 1948, establishing, a, one, man, unit, of, bacterial, genetics, in, 1936, fisher, used, a, pearson, s, chi, squared, test, to, analyze, mendel, s, data, and, concluded, that, mendel, s, results, were, far, too, perfect, suggesting, that, adjustments, intentional, or, unconscious, had, been, made, to, the, data, to, make, the, observations, fit, the, hypothesis, later, authors, have, claimed, fisher, s, analysis, was, flawed, proposing, various, statistical, and, botanical, explanations, for, mendel, s, numbers, in, 1947, fisher, co, founded, the, journal, heredity, with, cyril, darlington, and, in, 1949, he, published, the, theory, of, inbreeding, in, 1950, he, published, gene, frequencies, in, a, cline, determined, by, selection, and, diffusion, he, developed, computational, algorithms, for, analyzing, data, from, his, balanced, experimental, designs, with, various, editions, and, translations, becoming, a, standard, reference, work, for, scientists, in, many, disciplines, in, ecological, genetics, he, and, e, b, ford, showed, that, the, force, of, natural, selection, was, much, stronger, than, had, been, assumed, with, many, ecogenetic, situations, such, as, polymorphism, being, maintained, by, the, force, of, selection, during, this, time, he, also, worked, on, mouse, chromosome, mapping, breeding, the, mice, in, laboratories, in, his, own, house, fisher, publicly, spoke, out, against, the, 1950, study, showing, that, smoking, tobacco, causes, lung, cancer, arguing, that, correlation, does, not, imply, causation, to, quote, his, biographers, yates, and, mather, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, fact, that, fisher, was, employed, as, consultant, by, the, tobacco, firms, in, this, controversy, casts, doubt, on, the, value, of, his, arguments, this, is, to, misjudge, the, man, he, was, not, above, accepting, financial, reward, for, his, labours, but, the, reason, for, his, interest, was, undoubtedly, his, dislike, and, mistrust, of, puritanical, tendencies, of, all, kinds, and, perhaps, also, the, personal, solace, he, had, always, found, in, tobacco, others, have, suggested, that, his, analysis, was, biased, by, professional, conflicts, and, his, own, love, of, smoking, he, was, a, heavy, pipe, smoker, he, gave, the, 1953, croonian, lecture, on, population, genetics, in, the, winter, of, 1954, 1955, fisher, met, debabrata, basu, the, indian, statistician, who, wrote, in, 1988, with, his, reference, set, argument, sir, ronald, was, trying, to, find, a, via, media, between, the, two, poles, of, statistics, berkeley, and, bayes, my, efforts, to, understand, this, fisher, compromise, led, me, to, the, likelihood, principle, in, 1957, a, retired, fisher, emigrated, to, australia, where, he, spent, time, as, a, senior, research, fellow, at, the, australian, commonwealth, scientific, and, industrial, research, organisation, csiro, in, adelaide, south, australia, during, this, time, he, continued, in, his, denial, of, tobacco, harm, and, enlisted, german, eugenicist, otmar, von, verschuer, to, his, cause, following, surgery, for, colon, cancer, he, died, of, post, operative, complications, in, queen, elizabeth, hospital, in, adelaide, in, 1962, his, remains, are, interred, in, st, peter, s, cathedral, adelaide, fisher, s, doctoral, students, included, walter, bodmer, d, j, finney, ebenezer, laing, mary, f, lyon, and, c, r, rao, although, a, prominent, opponent, of, bayesian, statistics, fisher, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, bayesian, in, 1950, the, 1930, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, is, commonly, cited, in, biology, books, and, outlines, many, important, concepts, such, as, fisher, is, also, known, for, fisher, married, eileen, guinness, with, whom, he, had, two, sons, and, six, daughters, his, marriage, disintegrated, during, world, war, ii, and, his, older, son, george, an, aviator, was, killed, in, combat, his, daughter, joan, who, wrote, a, biography, of, her, father, married, the, statistician, george, e, p, box, according, to, yates, and, mather, his, large, family, in, particular, reared, in, conditions, of, great, financial, stringency, was, a, personal, expression, of, his, genetic, and, evolutionary, convictions, fisher, was, noted, for, being, loyal, and, was, seen, as, a, patriot, a, member, of, the, church, of, england, politically, conservative, as, well, as, a, scientific, rationalist, he, developed, a, reputation, for, carelessness, in, his, dress, and, was, the, archetype, of, the, absent, minded, professor, h, allen, orr, describes, him, in, the, boston, review, as, a, deeply, devout, anglican, who, between, founding, modern, statistics, and, population, genetics, penned, articles, for, church, magazines, in, a, 1955, broadcast, on, science, and, christianity, he, said, the, custom, of, making, abstract, dogmatic, assertions, is, not, certainly, derived, from, the, teaching, of, jesus, but, has, been, a, widespread, weakness, among, religious, teachers, in, subsequent, centuries, i, do, not, think, that, the, word, for, the, christian, virtue, of, faith, should, be, prostituted, to, mean, the, credulous, acceptance, of, all, such, piously, intended, assertions, much, self, deception, in, the, young, believer, is, needed, to, convince, himself, that, he, knows, that, of, which, in, reality, he, knows, himself, to, be, ignorant, that, surely, is, hypocrisy, against, which, we, have, been, most, conspicuously, warned, fisher, was, involved, with, the, society, for, psychical, research, between, 1950, and, 1951, fisher, along, with, other, leading, geneticists, and, anthropologists, of, his, time, was, asked, to, comment, on, a, statement, that, unesco, was, preparing, on, the, nature, of, race, and, racial, differences, which, was, published, in, 1950, as, the, unesco, statement, on, race, the, statement, along, with, the, comments, and, criticisms, of, a, large, number, of, scientists, including, fisher, is, published, in, the, race, concept, results, of, an, inquiry, 1952, fisher, was, one, of, four, scientists, who, opposed, the, statement, in, his, own, words, fisher, s, opposition, is, based, on, one, fundamental, objection, to, the, statement, which, destroys, the, very, spirit, of, the, whole, document, he, believes, that, human, groups, differ, profoundly, in, their, innate, capacity, for, intellectual, and, emotional, development, and, concludes, from, this, that, the, practical, international, problem, is, that, of, learning, to, share, the, resources, of, this, planet, amicably, with, persons, of, materially, different, nature, and, that, this, problem, is, being, obscured, by, entirely, well, intentioned, efforts, to, minimize, the, real, differences, that, exist, fisher, s, opinions, are, clarified, by, his, more, detailed, comments, on, section, 5, of, the, statement, which, are, concerned, with, psychological, and, mental, differences, between, the, races, section, 5, concludes, as, follows, scientifically, however, we, realized, that, any, common, psychological, attribute, is, more, likely, to, be, due, to, a, common, historical, and, social, background, and, that, such, attributes, may, obscure, the, fact, that, within, different, populations, consisting, of, many, human, types, one, will, find, approximately, the, same, range, of, temperament, and, intelligence, 14, of, the, entire, statement, section, 5, recorded, the, most, dissenting, viewpoints, it, was, recorded, that, fisher, s, attitude, is, the, same, as, muller, s, and, sturtevant, s, 56, muller, s, criticism, was, recorded, in, more, detail, and, was, noted, to, represent, an, important, trend, of, ideas, i, quite, agree, with, the, chief, intention, of, the, article, as, a, whole, which, i, take, it, is, to, bring, out, the, relative, unimportance, of, such, genetic, mental, differences, between, races, as, may, exist, in, contrast, to, the, importance, of, the, mental, differences, between, individuals, as, well, as, between, nations, caused, by, tradition, training, and, other, aspects, of, the, environment, however, in, view, of, the, admitted, existence, of, some, physically, expressed, hereditary, differences, of, a, conspicuous, nature, between, the, averages, or, the, medians, of, the, races, it, would, be, strange, if, there, were, not, also, some, hereditary, differences, affecting, the, mental, characteristics, which, develop, in, a, given, environment, between, these, averages, or, medians, at, the, same, time, these, mental, differences, might, usually, be, unimportant, in, comparison, with, those, between, individuals, of, the, same, race, to, the, great, majority, of, geneticists, it, seems, absurd, to, suppose, that, psychological, characteristics, are, subject, to, entirely, different, laws, of, heredity, or, development, than, other, biological, characteristics, even, though, the, former, characteristics, are, far, more, influenced, than, the, latter, by, environment, in, the, form, of, past, experiences, they, must, have, a, highly, complex, genetic, basis, 52, fisher, s, own, words, were, quoted, as, follows, as, you, ask, for, remarks, and, suggestions, there, is, one, that, occurs, to, me, unfortunately, of, a, somewhat, fundamental, nature, namely, that, the, statement, as, it, stands, appears, to, draw, a, distinction, between, the, body, and, mind, of, men, which, must, i, think, prove, untenable, it, appears, to, me, unmistakable, that, gene, differences, which, influence, the, growth, or, physiological, development, of, an, organism, will, ordinarily, pari, passu, influence, the, congenital, inclinations, and, capacities, of, the, mind, in, fact, i, should, say, that, to, vary, conclusion, 2, on, page, 5, available, scientific, knowledge, provides, a, firm, basis, for, believing, that, the, groups, of, mankind, differ, in, their, innate, capacity, for, intellectual, and, emotional, development, seeing, that, such, groups, do, differ, undoubtedly, in, a, very, large, number, of, their, genes, 56, fisher, also, ended, a, 1954, letter, to, reginald, ruggles, gates, a, canadian, born, geneticist, who, argued, that, different, racial, groups, were, different, species, with, the, words, i, am, sorry, that, there, should, be, propaganda, in, favour, of, miscegenation, in, north, america, as, i, am, sure, it, can, do, nothing, but, harm, is, it, beyond, human, endeavour, to, give, and, justly, administer, equal, rights, to, all, citizens, without, fooling, ourselves, that, these, are, equivalent, items, fisher, s, writings, nearly, all, discuss, human, populations, or, humanity, as, a, whole, without, reference, to, race, or, specific, racial, groups, and, none, of, his, work, explicitly, supports, the, idea, of, racial, superiority, or, white, supremacy, fisher, had, a, close, personal, relationship, with, indian, statistician, p, c, mahalanobis, and, significantly, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, indian, statistical, institute, and, fisher, s, graduate, students, included, walter, bodmer, a, child, of, jewish, german, parents, who, fled, from, nazi, germany, while, he, was, young, and, ebenezer, laing, an, african, geneticist, from, ghana, daniel, kevles, an, american, historian, of, science, described, fisher, as, an, anti, racist, conservative, however, british, historian, robert, j, evans, writing, in, the, new, statesman, argued, that, fisher, s, views, on, eugenics, and, his, opposition, to, unesco, s, statement, about, genetic, racial, differences, were, indicative, of, racism, in, 1911, fisher, became, founding, chairman, of, the, university, of, cambridge, eugenics, society, whose, other, founding, members, included, john, maynard, keynes, r, c, punnett, and, horace, darwin, after, members, of, the, cambridge, society, including, fisher, stewarded, the, first, international, eugenics, congress, in, london, in, summer, 1912, a, link, was, forged, with, the, eugenics, society, uk, he, saw, eugenics, as, addressing, pressing, social, and, scientific, issues, that, encompassed, and, drove, his, interest, in, both, genetics, and, statistics, during, world, war, i, fisher, started, writing, book, reviews, for, the, eugenics, review, and, volunteered, to, undertake, all, such, reviews, for, the, journal, being, hired, for, a, part, time, position, the, last, third, of, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, focused, on, eugenics, attributing, the, fall, of, civilizations, to, the, fertility, of, their, upper, classes, being, diminished, and, used, british, 1911, census, data, to, show, an, inverse, relationship, between, fertility, and, social, class, which, was, partly, due, he, claimed, to, the, lower, financial, costs, and, hence, increasing, social, status, of, families, with, fewer, children, he, proposed, the, abolition, of,

created, the, foundations, for, modern, statistical, science, while, richard, dawkins, named, him, the, greatest, biologist, since, darwin, not, only, was, he, the, most, original, and, constructive, of, the, architects, of, the, neo, darwinian, synthesis, fisher, also, was, the, father, of, modern, statistics, and, experimental, design, he, therefore, could, be, said, to, have, provided, researchers, in, biology, and, medicine, with, their, most, important, research, tools, as, well, as, with, the, modern, version, of, biology, s, central, theorem, geoffrey, miller, said, of, him, to, biologists, he, was, an, architect, of, the, modern, synthesis, that, used, mathematical, models, to, integrate, mendelian, genetics, with, darwin, s, selection, theories, to, psychologists, fisher, was, the, inventor, of, various, statistical, tests, that, are, still, supposed, to, be, used, whenever, possible, in, psychology, journals, to, farmers, fisher, was, the, founder, of, experimental,

which, became, part, of, the, modern, synthesis, the, interpretation, of, the, mathematical, theories, of, population, genetics, became, a, bone, of, contention, between, fisher, and, wright, by, the,
