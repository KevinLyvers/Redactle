end, of, the, 1930s, christie, wrote, in, her, diary, that, she, was, finding, poirot, insufferable, and, by, the, 1960s, she, felt, he, was, an, egocentric, creep, thompson, believes, christie, s, occasional, antipathy, to, her, creation, is, overstated, and, points, out, that, in, later, life, she, sought, to, protect, him, against, misrepresentation, as, powerfully, as, if, he, were, her,

christie, said, miss, marple, was, not, in, any, way, a, picture, of, my, grandmother, she, was, far, more, fussy, and, spinsterish, than, my, grandmother, ever, was, but, her, autobiography, establishes, a, firm, connection, between, the, fictional, character, and, christie, s, step, grandmother, margaret, miller, auntie, grannie, and, her, ealing, cronies, 422, 23, both, marple, and, miller, always, expected, the, worst, of, everyone, and, everything, and, were, with, almost, frightening, accuracy, usually, proved, right, 422, marple, appeared, in, 12, novels, and, 20, stories, during, the, second, world, war, christie, wrote, two, novels, curtain, and, sleeping, murder, featuring, hercule, poirot, and, miss, marple, respectively, both, books, were, sealed, in, a, bank, vault, and, she, made, over, the, copyrights, by, deed, of, gift, to, her, daughter, and, her, husband, to, provide, each, with, a, kind, of, insurance, policy, 344, 190, christie, had, a, heart, attack, and, a, serious, fall, in, 1974, after, which, she, was, unable, to, write, 372, her, daughter, authorised, the, publication, of, curtain, in, 1975, 375, and, sleeping, murder, was, published, posthumously, in, 1976, 376, these, publications, followed, the, success, of, the, 1974, film, version, of, murder, on, the, orient, express, 497, shortly, before, the, publication, of, curtain, poirot, became, the, first, fictional, character, to, have, an, obituary, in, the, new, york, times, which, was, printed, on, page, one, on, 6, august, 1975, christie, never, wrote, a, novel, or, short, story, featuring, both, poirot, and, miss, marple, 375, in, a, recording, discovered, and, released, in, 2008, christie, revealed, the, reason, for, this, hercule, poirot, a, complete, egoist, would, not, like, being, taught, his, business, or, having, suggestions, made, to, him, by, an, elderly, spinster, lady, hercule, poirot, a, professional, sleuth, would, not, be, at, home, at, all, in, miss, marple, s, world, in, 2013, the, christie, family, supported, the, release, of, a, new, poirot, story, the, monogram, murders, written, by, british, author, sophie, hannah, hannah, later,

duchess, of, death, the, mistress, of, mystery, and, the, queen, of, crime, 15, early, in, her, career, a, reporter, noted, that, her, plots, are, possible, logical, and, always, new, according, to, hannah, at, the, start, of, each, novel, she, shows, us, an, apparently, impossible, situation, and, we, go, mad, wondering, how, can, this, be, happening, then, slowly, she, reveals, how, the, impossible, is, not, only, possible, but, the, only, thing, that, could, have, happened, christie, developed, her, storytelling, techniques, during, what, has, been, called, the, golden, age, of, detective, fiction, author, dilys, winn, called, christie, the, doyenne, of, coziness, a, sub, genre, which, featured, a, small, village, setting, a, hero, with, faintly, aristocratic, family, connections, a, plethora, of, red, herrings, and, a, tendency, to, commit, homicide, with, sterling, silver, letter, openers, and, poisons, imported, from, paraguay, at, the, end, in, a, christie, hallmark, the, detective, usually, gathers, the, surviving, suspects, into, one, room, explains, the, course, of, their, deductive, reasoning, and, reveals, the, guilty, party, but, there, are, exceptions, where, it, is, left, to, the, guilty, party, to, explain, all, such, as, and, then, there, were, none, and, endless, night, christie, did, not, limit, herself, to, quaint, english, villages, the, action, might, take, place, on, a, small, island, and, then, there, were, none, an, aeroplane, death, in, the, clouds, a, train, murder, on, the, orient, express, a, steamship, death, on, the, nile, a, smart, london, flat, cards, on, the, table, a, resort, in, the, west, indies, a, caribbean, mystery, or, an, archaeological, dig, murder, in, mesopotamia, but, the, circle, of, potential, suspects, is, usually, closed, and, intimate, family, members, friends, servants, business, associates, fellow, travellers, 37, stereotyped, characters, abound, the, femme, fatale, the, stolid, policeman, the, devoted, servant, the, dull, colonel, but, these, may, be, subverted, to, stymie, the, reader, impersonations, and, secret, alliances, are, always, possible, 58, there, is, always, a, motive, most, often, money, there, are, very, few, killers, in, christie, who, enjoy, murder, for, its, own, sake, 379, 396, professor, of, pharmacology, michael, c, gerald, noted, that, in, over, half, her, novels, one, or, more, victims, are, poisoned, albeit, not, always, to, the, full, satisfaction, of, the, perpetrator, viii, guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt, instruments, and, even, a, hatchet, were, also, used, but, christie, never, resorted, to, elaborate, mechanical, or, scientific, means, to, explain, her, ingenuity, 57, according, to, john, curran, author, and, literary, adviser, to, the, christie, estate, many, of, her, clues, are, mundane, objects, a, calendar, a, coffee, cup, wax, flowers, a, beer, bottle, a, fireplace, used, during, a, heat, wave, 38, according, to, crime, writer, p, d, james, christie, was, prone, to, making, the, unlikeliest, character, the, guilty, party, alert, readers, could, sometimes, identify, the, culprit, by, identifying, the, least, likely, suspect, christie, mocked, this, insight, in, her, foreword, to, cards, on, the, table, spot, the, person, least, likely, to, have, committed, the, crime, and, in, nine, times, out, of, ten, your, task, is, finished, since, i, do, not, want, my, faithful, readers, to, fling, away, this, book, in, disgust, i, prefer, to, warn, them, beforehand, that, this, is, not, that, kind, of, book, 135, 36, on, bbc, radio, 4, s, desert, island, discs, in, 2007, brian, aldiss, said, christie, had, told, him, she, wrote, her, books, up, to, the, last, chapter, then, decided, who, the, most, unlikely, suspect, was, after, which, she, would, go, back, and, make, the, necessary, changes, to, frame, that, person, based, upon, a, study, of, her, working, notebooks, curran, describes, how, christie, would, first, create, a, cast, of, characters, choose, a, setting, and, then, produce, a, list, of, scenes, in, which, specific, clues, would, be, revealed, the, order, of, scenes, would, be, revised, as, she, developed, her, plot, of, necessity, the, murderer, had, to, be, known, to, the, author, before, the, sequence, could, be, finalised, and, she, began, to, type, or, dictate, the, first, draft, of, her, novel, much, of, the, work, particularly, dialogue, was, done, in, her, head, before, she, put, it, on, paper, 241, 45, 33, in, 2013, the, 600, members, of, the, crime, writers, association, chose, the, murder, of, roger, ackroyd, as, the, best, whodunit, ever, written, author, julian, symons, observed, in, an, obvious, sense, the, book, fits, within, the, conventions, the, setting, is, a, village, deep, within, the, english, countryside, roger, ackroyd, dies, in, his, study, there, is, a, butler, who, behaves, suspiciously, every, successful, detective, story, in, this, period, involved, a, deceit, practised, upon, the, reader, and, here, the, trick, is, the, highly, original, one, of, making, the, murderer, the, local, doctor, who, tells, the, story, and, acts, as, poirot, s, watson, 106, 07, critic, sutherland, scott, stated, if, agatha, christie, had, made, no, other, contribution, to, the, literature, of, detective, fiction, she, would, still, deserve, our, grateful, thanks, for, writing, this, novel, in, september, 2015, to, mark, her, 125th, birthday, and, then, there, were, none, was, named, the, world, s, favourite, christie, in, a, vote, sponsored, by, the, author, s, estate, the, novel, is, emblematic, of, both, her, use, of, formula, and, her, willingness, to, discard, it, and, then, there, were, none, carries, the, closed, society, type, of, murder, mystery, to, extreme, lengths, according, to, author, charles, osborne, 170, it, begins, with, the, classic, set, up, of, potential, victim, s, and, killer, s, isolated, from, the, outside, world, but, then, violates, conventions, there, is, no, detective, involved, in, the, action, no, interviews, of, suspects, no, careful, search, for, clues, and, no, suspects, gathered, together, in, the, last, chapter, to, be, confronted, with, the, solution, as, christie, herself, said, ten, people, had, to, die, without, it, becoming, ridiculous, or, the, murderer, being, obvious, 457, critics, agreed, she, had, succeeded, the, arrogant, mrs, christie, this, time, set, herself, a, fearsome, test, of, her, own, ingenuity, the, reviews, not, surprisingly, were, without, exception, wildly, adulatory, 170, 71, christie, included, stereotyped, descriptions, of, characters, in, her, work, especially, before, 1945, when, such, attitudes, were, more, commonly, expressed, publicly, particularly, in, regard, to, italians, jews, and, non, europeans, 264, 66, for, example, she, described, men, of, hebraic, extraction, sallow, men, with, hooked, noses, wearing, rather, flamboyant, jewellery, in, the, short, story, the, soul, of, the, croupier, from, the, collection, the, mysterious, mr, quin, in, 1947, the, anti, defamation, league, in, the, us, sent, an, official, letter, of, complaint, to, christie, s, american, publishers, dodd, mead, and, company, regarding, perceived, antisemitism, in, her, works, christie, s, british, literary, agent, later, wrote, to, her, us, representative, authorising, american, publishers, to, omit, the, word, jew, when, it, refers, to, an, unpleasant, character, in, future, books, 386, in, the, hollow, published, in, 1946, one, of, the, characters, is, described, by, another, as, a, whitechapel, jewess, with, dyed, hair, and, a, voice, like, a, corncrake, a, small, woman, with, a, thick, nose, henna, red, hair, and, a, disagreeable, voice, to, contrast, with, the, more, stereotyped, descriptions, christie, portrayed, some, foreign, characters, as, victims, or, potential, victims, at, the, hands, of, english, malefactors, such, as, respectively, olga, seminoff, hallowe, en, party, and, katrina, reiger, in, the, short, story, how, does, your, garden, grow, jewish, characters, are, often, seen, as, un, english, such, as, oliver, manders, in, three, act, tragedy, but, they, are, rarely, the, culprits, in, 2023, the, telegraph, reported, that, several, agatha, christie, novels, have, been, edited, to, remove, potentially, offensive, language, including, insults, and, references, to, ethnicity, poirot, and, miss, marple, mysteries, written, between, 1920, and, 1976, have, had, passages, reworked, or, removed, in, new, editions, published, by, harpercollins, in, order, to, strip, them, of, language, and, descriptions, that, modern, audiences, find, offensive, especially, those, involving, the, characters, christie, s, protagonists, encounter, outside, the, uk, sensitivity, readers, had, made, the, edits, which, were, evident, in, digital, versions, of, the, new, editions, including, the, entire, miss, marple, run, and, selected, poirot, novels, set, to, be, released, or, that, have, been, released, since, 2020, in, addition, to, hercule, poirot, and, miss, marple, christie, also, created, amateur, detectives, thomas, tommy, beresford, and, his, wife, prudence, tuppence, n, e, cowley, who, appear, in, four, novels, and, one, collection, of, short, stories, published, between, 1922, and, 1974, unlike, her, other, sleuths, the, beresfords, were, only, in, their, early, twenties, when, introduced, in, the, secret, adversary, and, were, allowed, to, age, alongside, their, creator, 19, 20, she, treated, their, stories, with, a, lighter, touch, giving, them, a, dash, and, verve, which, was, not, universally, admired, by, critics, 63, their, last, adventure, postern, of, fate, was, christie, s, last, novel, 477, harley, quin, was, easily, the, most, unorthodox, of, christie, s, fictional, detectives, 70, inspired, by, christie, s, affection, for, the, figures, from, the, harlequinade, the, semi, supernatural, quin, always, works, with, an, elderly, conventional, man, called, satterthwaite, the, pair, appear, in, 14, short, stories, 12, of, which, were, collected, in, 1930, as, the, mysterious, mr, quin, 78, 80, mallowan, described, these, tales, as, detection, in, a, fanciful, vein, touching, on, the, fairy, story, a, natural, product, of, agatha, s, peculiar, imagination, 80, satterthwaite, also, appears, in, a, novel, three, act, tragedy, and, a, short, story, dead, man, s, mirror, both, of, which, feature, poirot, 81, another, of, her, lesser, known, characters, is, parker, pyne, a, retired, civil, servant, who, assists, unhappy, people, in, an, unconventional, manner, 118, 19, the, 12, short, stories, which, introduced, him, parker, pyne, investigates, 1934, are, best, remembered, for, the, case, of, the, discontented, soldier, which,
