because, of, the, confusion, of, the, aerial, engagement, none, of, the, pilots, knew, which, aircraft, they, had, shot, down, dahl, described, it, as, an, endless, blur, of, enemy, fighters, whizzing, towards, me, from, every, side, in, may, as, the, germans, were, pressing, on, athens, dahl, was, evacuated, to, egypt, his, squadron, was, reassembled, in, haifa, to, take, part, in,

june, in, a, memoir, dahl, recounts, in, detail, an, attack, by, him, and, his, fellow, hurricane, pilots, on, the, vichy, held, rayak, airfield, he, says, that, as, he, and, his, fellow, hurricane, pilots, swept, in, low, over, the, field, at, midday, we, saw, to, our, astonishment, a, bunch, of, girls, in, brightly, coloured, cotton, dresses, standing, out, by, the, planes, with, glasses, in, their, hands, having, drinks, with, the, french, pilots, and, i, remember, seeing, bottles, of, wine, standing, on, the, wing, of, one, of, the, planes, as, we, went, swooshing, over, it, was, a, sunday, morning, and, the, frenchmen, were, evidently, entertaining, their, girlfriends, and, showing, off, their, aircraft, to, them, which, was, a, very, french, thing, to, do, in, the, middle, of, a, war, at, a, front, line, aerodrome, every, one, of, us, held, our, fire, on, that, first, pass, over, the, flying, field, and, it, was, wonderfully, comical, to, see, the, girls, all, dropping, their, wine, glasses, and, galloping, in, their, high, heels, for, the, door, of, the, nearest, building, we, went, round, again, but, this, time, we, were, no, longer, a, surprise, and, they, were, ready, for, us, with, their, ground, defences, and, i, am, afraid, that, our, chivalry, resulted, in, damage, to, several, of, our, hurricanes, including, my, own, but, we, destroyed, five, of, their, planes, on, the, ground, despite, this, somewhat, light, hearted, account, dahl, also, noted, that, ultimately, vichy, forces, killed, four, of, the, nine, hurricane, pilots, in, his, squadron, describing, the, vichy, forces, as, disgusting, he, stated, that, thousands, of, lives, were, lost, and, i, for, one, have, never, forgiven, the, vichy, french, for, the, unnecessary, slaughter, they, caused, when, he, began, to, get, severe, headaches, that, caused, him, to, black, out, he, was, invalided, home, to, britain, where, he, stayed, with, his, mother, in, buckinghamshire, although, at,

later, dahl, found, he, liked, the, atmosphere, of, the, us, capital, he, shared, a, house, with, another, attach, at, 1610, 34th, street, nw, in, georgetown, but, after, ten, days, in, his, new,

been, flying, around, seeing, horrible, things, now, almost, instantly, i, found, myself, in, the, middle, of, a, pre, war, cocktail, party, in, america, dahl, was, unimpressed, by, his, office, in,

a, number, of, changes, were, made, to, the, original, manuscript, before, publication, he, originally, titled, the, article, as, a, piece, of, cake, but, the, magazine, changed, it, to, shot, down,

booklet, and, quentin, blake, to, illustrate, it, to, help, young, people, enjoy, using, the, railways, safely, the, booklet, is, structured, as, a, conversation, with, children, and, it, was, distributed, to, primary, school, pupils, in, britain, according, to, children, s, literature, critic, deborah, cogan, thacker, dahl, s, tendency, in, his, children, s, books, is, to, put, child, characters, in, powerful, positions, and, so, the, idea, of, talking, down, to, children, was, always, an, anathema, to, him, therefore, dahl, in, the, introduction, of, the, booklet, states, i, must, now, regretfully, become, one, of, those, unpopular, giants, who, tells, you, what, to, do, and, what, not, to, do, this, is, something, i, have, never, done, in, any, of, my, books, he, was, mischievous, a, grown, up, being, mischievous, he, addresses, you, a, child, as, somebody, who, knows, about, the, world, he, was, a, grown, up, and, he, was, bigger, than, most, who, is, on, your, side, that, must, have, something, to, do, with, it, illustrator, quentin, blake, on, the, lasting, appeal, of, dahl, s, children, s, books, dahl, s, children, s, works, are, usually, told, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, child, they, typically, involve, adult, villains, who, hate, and, mistreat, children, and, feature, at, least, one, good, adult, to, counteract, the, villain, s, these, stock, characters, are, possibly, a, reference, to, the, abuse, that, dahl, stated, that, he, experienced, in, the, boarding, schools, he, attended, in, a, biography, of, dahl, matthew, dennison, wrote, that, his, writing, frequently, included, protests, against, unfairness, dahl, s, books, see, the, triumph, of, the, child, children, s, book, critic, amanda, craig, said, he, was, unequivocal, that, it, is, the, good, young, and, kind, who, triumph, over, the, old, greedy, and, the, wicked, anna, leskiewicz, in, the, telegraph, wrote, it, s, often, suggested, that, dahl, s, lasting, appeal, is, a, result, of, his, exceptional, talent, for, wriggling, his, way, into, children, s, fantasies, and, fears, and, laying, them, out, on, the, page, with, anarchic, delight, adult, villains, are, drawn, in, terrifying, detail, before, they, are, exposed, as, liars, and, hypocrites, and, brought, tumbling, down, with, retributive, justice, either, by, a, sudden, magic, or, the, superior, acuity, of, the, children, they, mistreat, while, his, whimsical, fantasy, stories, feature, an, underlying, warm, sentiment, they, are, often, juxtaposed, with, grotesque, darkly, comic, and, sometimes, harshly, violent, scenarios, the, witches, george, s, marvellous, medicine, and, matilda, are, examples, of, this, formula, the, bfg, follows, with, the, good, giant, the, bfg, or, big, friendly, giant, representing, the, good, adult, archetype, and, the, other, giants, being, the, bad, adults, this, formula, is, also, somewhat, evident, in, dahl, s, film, script, for, chitty, chitty, bang, bang, class, conscious, themes, also, surface, in, works, such, as, fantastic, mr, fox, and, danny, the, champion, of, the, world, where, the, unpleasant, wealthy, neighbours, are, outwitted, dahl, also, features, characters, who, are, very, fat, usually, children, augustus, gloop, bruce, bogtrotter, and, bruno, jenkins, are, a, few, of, these, characters, although, an, enormous, woman, named, aunt, sponge, features, in, james, and, the, giant, peach, and, the, nasty, farmer, boggis, in, fantastic, mr, fox, is, an, enormously, fat, character, all, of, these, characters, with, the, possible, exception, of, bruce, bogtrotter, are, either, villains, or, simply, unpleasant, gluttons, they, are, usually, punished, for, this, augustus, gloop, drinks, from, willy, wonka, s, chocolate, river, disregarding, the, adults, who, tell, him, not, to, and, falls, in, getting, sucked, up, a, pipe, and, nearly, being, turned, into, fudge, in, matilda, bruce, bogtrotter, steals, cake, from, the, evil, headmistress, miss, trunchbull, and, is, forced, to, eat, a, gigantic, chocolate, cake, in, front, of, the, school, when, he, unexpectedly, succeeds, at, this, trunchbull, smashes, the, empty, plate, over, his, head, in, the, witches, bruno, jenkins, is, lured, by, the, witches, whose, leader, is, the, grand, high, witch, into, their, convention, with, the, promise, of, chocolate, before, they, turn, him, into, a, mouse, aunt, sponge, is, flattened, by, a, giant, peach, when, dahl, was, a, boy, his, mother, used, to, tell, him, and, his, sisters, tales, about, trolls, and, other, mythical, norwegian, creatures, and, some, of, his, children, s, books, contain, references, or, elements, inspired, by, these, stories, such, as, the, giants, in, the, bfg, the, fox, family, in, fantastic, mr, fox, and, the, trolls, in, the, minpins, receiving, the, 1983, world, fantasy, award, for, life, achievement, dahl, encouraged, his, children, and, his, readers, to, let, their, imagination, run, free, his, daughter, lucy, stated, his, spirit, was, so, large, and, so, big, he, taught, us, to, believe, in, magic, she, said, her, father, later, told, her, that, if, they, had, simply, said, goodnight, after, a, bedtime, story, he, assumed, it, wasn, t, a, good, idea, but, if, they, begged, him, to, continue, he, knew, he, was, on, to, something, and, the, story, would, sometimes, turn, into, a, book, those, who, don, t, believe, in, magic, will, never, find, it, dahl, was, also, famous, for, his, inventive, playful, use, of, language, which, was, a, key, element, to, his, writing, he, invented, over, 500, new, words, by, scribbling, down, his, words, before, swapping, letters, around, and, adopting, spoonerisms, and, malapropisms, the, lexicographer, susan, rennie, stated, that, dahl, built, his, new, words, on, familiar, sounds, adding, he, didn, t, always, explain, what, his, words, meant, but, children, can, work, them, out, because, they, often, sound, like, a, word, they, know, and, he, loved, using, onomatopoeia, for, example, you, know, that, something, lickswishy, and, delumptious, is, good, to, eat, whereas, something, uckyslush, or, rotsome, is, definitely, not, he, also, used, sounds, that, children, love, to, say, like, squishous, and, squizzle, or, fizzlecrump, and, fizzwiggler, as, marketing, director, of, penguin, books, in, the, 1980s, barry, cunningham, travelled, the, uk, with, dahl, on, a, promotional, book, tour, during, which, he, asked, dahl, what, the, secret, of, his, success, was, with, dahl, responding, the, thing, you, ve, got, to, remember, is, that, humour, is, delayed, fear, laughter, is, delayed, fear, cunningham, later, recollected, if, you, look, at, the, way, he, uses, humour, and, the, way, that, children, use, humour, perhaps, sometimes, it, s, the, only, weapon, they, have, against, terrifying, circumstances, or, people, that, s, very, indicative, of, his, stories, and, the, style, of, those, stories, a, uk, television, special, titled, roald, dahl, s, revolting, rule, book, which, was, hosted, by, richard, e, grant, and, aired, on, 22, september, 2007, commemorated, dahl, s, 90th, birthday, and, also, celebrated, his, impact, as, a, children, s, author, in, popular, culture, it, also, featured, eight, main, rules, he, applied, on, all, his, children, s, books, in, 2016, marking, the, centenary, of, dahl, s, birth, rennie, compiled, the, oxford, roald, dahl, dictionary, which, includes, many, of, his, invented, words, and, their, meaning, rennie, commented, that, some, of, dahl, s, words, have, already, escaped, his, world, for, example, scrumdiddlyumptious, food, that, is, utterly, delicious, in, his, poetry, dahl, gives, a, humorous, re, interpretation, of, well, known, nursery, rhymes, and, fairy, tales, parodying, the, narratives, and, providing, surprise, endings, in, place, of, the, traditional, happily, ever, after, dahl, s,

factory, which, was, completed, and, rewritten, by, david, seltzer, after, dahl, failed, to, meet, deadlines, and, produced, as, the, film, willy, wonka, the, chocolate, factory, 1971, dahl, later, disowned, the, film, saying, he, was, disappointed, because, he, thought, it, placed, too, much, emphasis, on, willy, wonka, and, not, enough, on, charlie, he, was, also, infuriated, by, the, deviations, in, the, plot, devised, by, david, seltzer, in, his, draft, of, the, screenplay, this, resulted, in, his, refusal, for, any, more, versions, of, the, book, to, be, made, in, his, lifetime, as, well, as, an, adaptation, for, the, sequel, charlie, and, the, great, glass, elevator, he, wrote, the, script, for, a, film, that, began, filming, but, was, abandoned, death, where, is, thy,

clearly, felt, compelled, to, warn, his, young, readers, about, the, evils, of, the, world, taking, the, lesson, from, earlier, fairy, tales, that, they, could, stand, hard, truths, and, would, be, the, stronger, for, hearing, them, dahl, was, also, influenced, by, lewis, carroll, s, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, the, drink, me, episode, in, alice, inspired, a, scene, in, dahl, s,

an, incredibly, distinctive, style, his, subversive, unpredictable, plots, musical, prose, and, caustic, wit, are, impossible, to, imitate, and, yet, his, stories, have, proved, astonishingly, malleable, often, adapted, by, equally, idiosyncratic, writers, and, directors, when, translated, onto, stage, and, screen, his, works, seamlessly, take, on, the, impression, of, their, new, maker, like, in, many, of, his, stories, dahl, offers, a, narrative, where, troublemaking, is, rewarded, and, games, and, tricks, are, more, successful, than, following, rules, perhaps, this, more, than, anything, is, the, reason, why, dahl, s, stories, excite, the, imagination, of, so, many, adults, and, children, and, why, so, many, storytellers, across, stage, and, screen, can, t, resist, remaking, his, tales, in, their, own, individual, style, right, across, his, body, of, work, playfulness, and, inventiveness, are, always, prized, over, boring, qualities, like, obedience, and, deference, in,

review, and, was, the, subject, of, much, media, comment, and, criticism, at, the, time, according, to, dahl, until, this, point, in, time, a, race, of, people, meaning, jews, had, never, switched, so, rapidly, from, victims, to, barbarous, murderers, the, empathy, of, all, after, the, holocaust, had, turned, into, hatred, and, revulsion, dahl, wrote, that, clifton, s, book, would, make, readers, violently, anti, israeli, saying, i, am, not, anti, semitic, i, am, anti, israel, he, asked, must, israel, like, germany, be, brought, to, her, knees, before, she, learns, how, to, behave, in, this, world, the, united, states, he, said, was, so, utterly, dominated, by, the, great, jewish, financial, institutions, that, they, dare, not, defy, israelis, following, the, literary, review, article, dahl, told, a, journalist, from, the, new, statesman, there, s, a, trait, in, the, jewish, character, that, does, provoke, animosity, maybe, it, s, a, kind, of, lack, of, generosity, towards, non, jews, i, mean, there, is, always, a, reason, why, anti, anything, crops, up, anywhere, even, a, stinker, like, hitler, didn, t, just, pick, on, them, for, no, reason, in, 1990, during, an, interview, with, the, independent, dahl, explained, that, his, issue, with, israel, began, when, they, invaded, lebanon, in, 1982, they, killed, 22, 000, civilians, when, they, bombed, beirut, it, was, very, much, hushed, up, in, the, newspapers, because, they, are, primarily, jewish, owned, i, m, certainly, anti, israeli, and, i, ve, become, antisemitic, in, as, much, as, that, you, get, a, jewish, person, in, another, country, like, england, strongly, supporting, zionism, i, think, they, should, see, both, sides, it, s, the, same, old, thing, we, all, know, about, jews, and, the, rest, of, it, there, aren, t, any, non, jewish, publishers, anywhere, they, control, the, media, jolly, clever, thing, to, do, that, s, why, the, president, of, the, united, states, has, to, sell, all, this, stuff, to, israel, responding, in, 1990, to, a, journalist, from, the, jewish, chronicle, whom, he, considered, rude, he, said, i, am, an, old, hand, at, dealing, with, you, buggers, jeremy, treglown, in, his, 1994, biography, writes, of, dahl, s, first, novel, sometime, never, 1948, plentiful, revelations, about, nazi, anti, semitism, and, the, holocaust, did, not, discourage, him, from, satirising, a, little, pawnbroker, in, hounsditch, called, meatbein, who, when, the, wailing, started, would, rush, downstairs, to, the, large, safe, in, which, he, kept, his, money, open, it, and, wriggle, inside, on, to, the, lowest, shelf, where, he, lay, like, a, hibernating, hedgehog, until, the, all, clear, had, gone, in, a, short, story, entitled, madame, rosette, the, eponymous, character, is, termed, a, filthy, old, syrian, jewess, dahl, had, jewish, friends, including, the, philosopher, isaiah, berlin, who, commented, i, thought, he, might, say, anything, could, have, been, pro, arab, or, pro, jew, there, was, no, consistent, line, he, was, a, man, who, followed, whims, which, meant, he, would, blow, up, in, one, direction, so, to, speak, amelia, foster, director, of, the, roald, dahl, museum, in, great, missenden, says, this, is, again, an, example, of, how, dahl, refused, to, take, anything, seriously, even, himself, he, was, very, angry, at, the, israelis, he, had, a, childish, reaction, to, what, was, going, on, in, israel, dahl, wanted, to, provoke, as, he, always, provoked, at, dinner, his, publisher, was, a, jew, his, agent, was, a, jew, and, he, thought, nothing, but, good, things, of, them, he, asked, me, to, be, his, managing, director, and, i, m, jewish, in, 2014, the, royal, mint, decided, not, to, produce, a, coin, to, commemorate, the, centenary, of, dahl, s, birth, saying, that, it, considered, him, to, be, associated, with, antisemitism, and, not, regarded, as, an, author, of, the, highest, reputation, in, 2020, dahl, s, family, published, a, statement, on, the, official, roald, dahl, website, apologising, for, his, antisemitism, the, statement, says, the, dahl, family, and, the, roald, dahl, story, company, deeply, apologise, for, the, lasting, and, understandable, hurt, caused, by, some, of, roald, dahl, s, statements, those, prejudiced, remarks, are, incomprehensible, to, us, and, stand, in, marked, contrast, to, the, man, we, knew, and, to, the, values, at, the, heart, of, roald, dahl, s, stories, which, have, positively, impacted, young, people, for, generations, we, hope, that, just, as, he, did, at, his, best, at, his, absolute, worst, roald, dahl, can, help, remind, us, of, the, lasting, impact, of, words, the, apology, was, received, with, appreciation, by, some, jewish, groups, but, not, others, the, campaign, against, antisemitism, for, example, said, that, for, his, family, and, estate, to, have, waited, thirty, years, to, make, an, apology, apparently, until, lucrative, deals, were, signed, with, hollywood, is, disappointing, and, sadly, rather, more, comprehensible, in, 1972, eleanor, cameron, also, a, children, s, book, author, published, an, article, in, the, horn, book, criticising, charlie, and, the, chocolate, factory, for, being, self, referentially, hypocritical, what, i, object, to, in, charlie, is, its, phony, presentation, of, poverty, and, its, phony, humor, which, is, based, on, punishment, with, overtones, of, sadism, its, hypocrisy, which, is, epitomized, in, its, moral, stuck, like, a, marshmallow, in, a, lump, of, fudge, that, tv, is, horrible, and, hateful, and, time, wasting, and, that, children, should, read, good, books, instead, when, in, fact, the, book, itself, is, like, nothing, so, much, as, one, of, the, more, specious, television, shows, cameron, also, took, issue, with, dahl, s, depiction, of, the, african, derived, oompa, loompas, who, have, never, been, given, the, opportunity, of, any, life, outside, of, the, chocolate, factory, and, suggested, that, teachers, look, for, better, literature, to, use, in, the, classroom, in, 1973, dahl, posted, a, reply, calling, cameron, s, accusations, insensitive, and, monstrous, the, horn, book, published, cameron, s, response, where, she, clarified, that, she, intended, her, article, not, to, be, a, personal, attack, on, dahl, but, rather, to, point, out, that, although, the, book, is, a, work, of, fiction, it, still, influences, reality, herein, she, again, objected, to, the, characterization, of, the, oompa, loompas, stating, he, situation, of, the, oompa, loompas, is, real, it, could, not, be, more, so, and, it, is, anything, but, funny, the, debate, between, the, two, authors, sparked, much, discussion, and, a, number, of, letters, to, the, editor, a, 1991, washington, post, article, echoed, cameron, s, comments, with, michael, dirda, writing, the, oompa, loompas, reveal, virtually, every, stereotype, about, blacks, dirda, s, article, also, discussed, many, of, the, other, criticisms, of, dahl, s, writing, including, his, alleged, sexism, of, which, dirda, wrote, the, witches, verges, on, a, general, misogyny, in, a, 1998, article, for, lilith, michele, landsberg, analysed, the, alleged, issues, in, dahl, s, work, and, concluded, that, throughout, his, work, evil, domineering, smelly, fat, ugly, women, are, his, favorite, villains, in, 2008, una, mullally, wrote, an, article, for, the, irish, times, that, described, dahl, s, short, story, collection, switch, bitch, as, a, collection, better, forgotten, laden, with, crude, and, often, disturbing, sexual, fantasy, writing, nonetheless, mullally, argued, that, there, are, feminist, messages, in, dahl, s, work, even, if, they, may, be, obscured, the, witches, offers, up, plenty, of, feminist, complexities, the, witches, themselves, are, terrifying, and, vile, things, and, always, women, the, book, is, often, viewed, as, sexist, but, that, assessment, ignores, one, of, the, heroines, of, the, story, the, child, narrator, s, grandmother, in, 2023, puffin, books, which, holds, the, rights, to, all, dahl, s, children, s, books, ignited, controversy, after, they, hired, sensitivity, readers, to, go, through, the, original, text, of, dahl, s, works, which, led, to, hundreds, of, revisions, to, his, books, the, telegraph, published, a, list, of, many, of, these, changes, the, move, was, supported, by, a, number, of, authors, most, notably, by, joanne, harris, chair, of, the, society, of, authors, and, diego, jourdan, pereira, at, writer, s, digest, but, drew, many, more, critical, responses, several, public, figures, including, then, prime, minister, rishi, sunak, author, salman, rushdie, and, queen, camilla, all, spoke, out, against, the, changes, it, was, reported, that, when, dahl, was, alive, he, had, spoken, out, very, strongly, against, any, changes, ever, being, made, to, any, of, his, books, on, 23, february, 2023, puffin, announced, it, would, release, an, unedited, selection, of, dahl, s, children, s, books, as, the, roald, dahl, classic, collection, stating, we, ve, listened, to, the, debate, over, the, past, week, which, has, reaffirmed, the, extraordinary, power, of, roald, dahl, s, books, and, recognise, the, importance, of, keeping, dahl, s, classic, texts, in, print
