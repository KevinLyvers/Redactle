of, kyawhtin, nawrahta, with, this, decision, tabinshwehti, won, the, loyalty, of, his, brother, in, law, without, parallel, in, burmese, history, meanwhile, war, had, arrived, uncomfortably, close, to, his, realm, in, late, 1532, the, confederation, of, shan, states, already, ruling, much, of, upper, burma, attacked, its, erstwhile, ally, prome, and, sacked, the, city, although, the, confederation, was, content, to, keep, prome, as, a, vassal, the, toungoo, leadership, was, concerned, that, their, city, east, of, prome, on, the, same, latitude, separated, only, by, the, pegu, yoma, bago, yoma, range, was, an, obvious, next, target, to, be, sure, toungoo, did, have, some, advantages, tucked, away, behind, the, pegu, yoma, range, the, city, was, not, easy, to, march, from, ava, in, contrast, to, prome, on, the, irrawaddy, which, was, easily, accessible, from, ava, moreover, swelled, by, refugees, the, principality, now, commanded, considerably, more, manpower, than, its, traditional, base, would, have, allowed, for, nevertheless, the, toungoo, leadership, decided, that, their, kingdom, had, to, act, quickly, if, it, wished, to, avoid, being, swallowed, up, by, the, confederation, in, late, 1534, in, a, complete, break, from, his, father, s, longstanding, policy, tabinshwehti, decided, to, break, out, of, his, increasingly, narrow, realm, by, attacking, the, hanthawaddy, kingdom, to, the, south, though, the, burmese, chronicles, attribute, the, audacious, decision, to, the, king, alone, the, 18, year, old, king, was, more, probably, persuaded, by, older, more, experienced, ministers, at, the, court, who, may, have, also, played, a, major, role, in, the, initial, campaigns, in, the, next, 16, years, tabinshwehti, along, with, his, deputy, kyawhtin, nawrahta, later, bayinnaung, would, go, on, to, unite, many, of, the, petty, kingdoms, that, had, existed, since, the, fall, of, the, pagan, empire, in, 1287, the, king, and, his, court, chose, hanthawaddy, which, on, paper, was, the, strongest, kingdom, of, all, post, pagan, kingdoms, as, their, first, target, because, its, inexperienced, ruler, king, takayutpi, did, not, command, the, loyalty, of, his, vassals, in, martaban, mottama, and, the, irrawaddy, delta, moreover, hanthawaddy, s, trade, wealth, and, maritime, markets, made, the, coastal, kingdom, an, attractive, military, target, perhaps, most, importantly, the, toungoo, court, was, reasonably, certain, that, takayutpi, would, not, counterattack, indeed, about, two, and, half, years, earlier, tabinshwehti, and, his, chosen, men, eight, ponnas, 40, ministers, and, a, company, of, 500, most, skillful, horsemen, led, by, kyawhtin, nawrahta, had, made, an, uninvited, foray, into, the, shwemawdaw, pagoda, at, the, outskirts, of, pegu, the, capital, of, hanthawaddy, ostensibly, for, the, king, s, ear, piercing, ceremony, the, audacious, intrusion, went, unpunished, unlike, his, father, binnya, ran, ii, whose, strong, 1495, 96, counterattack, on, toungoo, taught, mingyi, nyo, never, to, raid, hanthawaddy, again, takayutpi, could, not, organize, his, kingdom, s, superior, resources, and, counterattack, in, the, beginning, toungoo, s, military, maneuvers, amounted, to, a, mere, raids, of, hanthawaddy, territory, its, initial, dry, season, raids, in, 1534, 1535, 1535, 1536, and, 1536, 1537, all, failed, against, pegu, s, fortified, defenses, aided, by, foreign, mercenaries, and, firearms, in, each, campaign, toungoo, armies, numbered, no, more, than, 6000, to, 7000, men, a, few, hundred, cavalry, and, a, few, dozen, war, elephants, more, importantly, they, did, not, yet, have, access, to, foreign, troops, and, firearms, as, expected, takayutpi, could, not, organize, any, retaliatory, action, his, nominal, subordinates, in, the, delta, and, martaban, did, not, send, any, help, nonetheless, pegu, s, defenses, led, by, two, leading, ministers, of, the, court, withstood, the, raids, after, the, repeated, failures, toungoo, used, a, stratagem, to, create, a, split, in, the, hanthawaddy, camp, providing, misinformation, about, the, loyalty, of, the, ministers, surprisingly, takayutpi, believed, toungoo, s, misinformation, and, executed, the, ministers, who, had, been, his, tutors, since, childhood, and, were, absolutely, devoted, to, him, then, when, toungoo, launched, another, invasion, takayutpi, was, helpless, and, decided, to, evacuate, his, capital, rather, than, fight, toungoo, forces, took, pegu, without, firing, a, shot, in, late, 1538, or, early, 1539, hanthawaddy, s, hopes, for, a, counterattack, vanished, after, the, battle, of, naungyo, in, which, gen, kyawhtin, nawrahta, s, toungoo, troops, despite, being, vastly, outnumbered, decimated, hanthawaddy, armies, in, the, delta, tabinshwehti, now, bestowed, kyawhtin, nawrahta, the, title, of, bayinnaung, king, s, elder, brother, toungoo, forces, followed, up, to, prome, where, takayutpi, had, taken, refuge, but, the, siege, was, broken, up, by, prome, s, overlord, confederation, takayutpi, died, soon, after, c, march, 1539, and, many, lords, from, the, delta, came, over, to, tabinshwehti, who, reappointed, them, to, their, posts, moreover, tabinshwehti, now, controlled, much, of, lower, burma, s, manpower, and, trade, wealth, and, gained, access, to, portuguese, mercenaries, and, their, firearms, tabinshwehti, next, tried, to, complete, his, control, of, lower, burma, in, 1540, he, issued, an, ultimatum, to, martaban, the, last, holdout, to, surrender, in, exchange, for, amnesty, however, the, offer, was, promptly, rejected, by, the, wealthy, port, s, ruler, saw, binnya, who, had, heavily, fortified, his, city, and, enlisted, several, portuguese, naval, and, land, mercenaries,

days, tabinshwehti, ordered, a, whole, scale, execution, of, the, viceroy, his, family, and, all, the, gallant, defenders, for, they, had, refused, his, prior, offer, of, amnesty, the, mass, execution, had, the, desired, effect, the, governors, of, moulmein, mawlaymyaing, and, southern, territories, present, day, mon, state, abutting, then, siamese, frontier, submitted, he, appointed, saw, lagun, ein, brother, in, law, of, takayutpi, as, viceroy, of, martaban, the, conquest, of, martaban, now, gave, his, upstart, regime, complete, control, of, lower, burma, s, manpower, access, to, foreign, firearms, and, maritime, wealth, to, pay, for, them, tabinshwehti, would, use, these, newfound, assets, for, further, expansion, the, sudden, emergence, of, toungoo, did, not, go, unnoticed,

despite, having, founded, the, largest, burmese, polity, since, 1287, he, made, no, effort, to, institute, a, new, more, centralized, administrative, model, he, appointed, his, inner, circle, to, key, locations, in, upper, burma, elsewhere, he, readily, reappointed, local, lords, who, made, timely, submissions, regardless, of, their, ethnic, background, he, made, no, attempt, to, administer, the, mon, speaking, lower, burma, with, burman, governors, in, general, he, made, every, effort, to, court, the, ethnic, mons, of, lower, burma, his, chief, queen, was, a, mon, and, he, was, crowned, in, mon, tradition, at, pegu, as, the, rightful, heir, of, pegu, throne, while, wearing, his, hair, in, the, mon, style, a, gesture, that, had, no, precedent, he, appointed, many, ethnic, mons, to, the, highest, offices, at, the, court, and, in, the, armed, forces, the, list, includes, saw, lagun, ein, viceroy, of, martaban, smim, payu, governor, of, myaungmya, and, indeed, smim, sawhtut, governor, of, sittaung, and, his, eventual, assassin, he, appointed, an, ethnic, mon, monk, with, the, title, of, maha, thanga, yaza, maha, sangha, raja, as, the, chief, primate, of, the, kingdom, in, november, 1544, while, he, may, have, courted, mons, for, he, depended, on, lower, burma, s, manpower, and, maritime, wealth, to, fund, his, wars, history, shows, he, truly, trusted, his, ethnic, mon, inner, circle, up, to, his, gruesome, death, he, needed, and, prized, loyal, local, lords, for, governing, since, he, spent, much, of, his, reign, 1534, 1549, on, military, campaigns, local, lords, in, turn, were, loyal, to, him, not, to, the, highly, devolved, central, administration, not, surprisingly, the, kingdom, he, had, built, up, purely, through, military, conquests, fell, apart, right, after, his, death, indeed, the, much, greater, empire, of, bayinnaung, which, too, was, built, on, sheer, military, conquests, would, see, the, same, fate, within, the, decade, following, the, conqueror, s, death, in, 1581, the, weak, decentralized, administration, era, would, continue, until, the, early, 17th, century, when, restored, toungoo, kings, first, introduced, administrative, reforms, to, centralize, power, tabinshwehti, s, legacy, looms, large, although, he, did, not, implement, any, administrative, reforms, his, military, conquests, assembled, the, largest, kingdom, in, burma, since, the, fall, of, pagan, in, 1287, his, administratively, fragile, kingdom, proved, to, be, the, impetus, for, the, eventual, reunification, of, the, entire, country, under, bayinnaung, even, if, the, core, of, the, reunified, burmese, state, would, stabilize, only, in, the, early, 17th, century, though, he, may, initially, have, been, urged, on, by, his, court, it, was, ultimately, his, decision, to, start, a, war, with, a, wealthier, but, poorly, led, neighbor, and, to, persist, until, the, victory, over, hanthawaddy, was, achieved, he, quickly, built, on, the, success, by, combining, his, kingdom, s, more, martial, tradition, with, the, maritime, wealth, and, manpower, of, lower, burma, which, enabled, him, to, acquire, foreign, mercenaries, and, firearms, this, fortuitous, combination, would, ultimately, lead, to, his, founding, of, the, toungoo, empire, his, success, in, breaking, out, of, an, increasingly, narrow, dry, zone, not, only, saved, the, only, remaining, ethnic, burman, led, kingdom, from, extinction, but, also, ensured, the, continued, spread, of, burmese, culture, and, language, in, the, irrawaddy, valley, however, not, all, his, legacies, endured, tabinshwehti, went, to, great, lengths, to, ensure, that, the, rise, of, his, regime, did, not, come, at, the, expense, of, lower, burma, s, ethnic, mon, culture, and, language, according, to, the, historian, victor, lieberman, had, later, toungoo, rulers, continued, tabinshwehti, s, policy, of, mon, burman, synthesis, ethnic, relations, within, the, irrawaddy, valley, might, have, moved, along, a, very, different, path, lieberman, calls, tabinshwehti, s, death, one, of, the, great, turning, points, of, mainland, history, while, tabinshwehti, s, considerable, achievements, are, overshadowed, by, bayinnaung, s, overwhelming, achievements, the, historian, htin, aung, writes, that, it, would, be, unfair, to, ignore, tabinshwehti, when, considering, the, achievements, of, bayinnaung, without, tabinshwehti, there, could, have, been, no, bayinnaung, tabinshwehti, is, still, remembered, as, a, brave, king, and, empire, builder, in, popular, culture, albeit, generally, in, a, secondary, role, in, the, stories, of, his, much, more, celebrated, successor, bayinnaung, the, exploits, of, tabinshwehti, and, bayinnaung, many, of, which, are, legends, are, still, faithfully, retold, in, books, and, songs, one, of, the, first, modern, novels, published, in, the, burmese, language, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, a, fictional, recreation, of, his, reign, named, tabinshwehti, wuttu, daw,
