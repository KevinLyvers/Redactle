neglected, their, promised, reward, and, greater, influence, may, have, been, the, cause, of, the, rebellion, which, was, suppressed, in, the, course, of, the, same, year, the, struggle, between, du, an, and, stefan, de, anski, prevented, serbian, intervention, in, bulgaria, on, behalf, of, anna, and, ivan, stephen, and, they, were, overthrown, by, ivan, alexander, in, march, 1331, however, ivan,

marriage, to, ivan, alexander, s, sister, helen, of, bulgaria, good, relations, with, bulgaria, continued, during, du, an, s, reign, and, though, bulgaria, was, weaker, then, serbia, it, did, not,

spring, of, 1334, serbs, launched, an, attack, on, byzantine, macedonia, benefiting, greatly, due, to, syrgiannes, strategic, abilities, knowledge, of, byzantine, position, and, his, allies, that,

and, prosek, hungarians, knowing, of, du, an, s, involvement, in, the, south, were, mobilizing, to, attack, serbia, from, the, north, hungarians, not, expecting, any, serious, serbian, resistance, penetrated, deep, into, serbia, reaching, neighborhood, of, i, a, monastery, hungarians, have, received, military, support, from, stephen, ii, of, bosnia, du, an, marched, north, to, face, hungarians,

byzantine, empire, between, the, regent, of, the, minor, emperor, john, v, palaiologos, anna, of, savoy, and, his, father, s, general, john, kantakouzenos, du, an, and, ivan, alexander, picked, opposite, sides, in, the, conflict, but, remained, at, peace, with, each, other, taking, advantage, of, the, byzantine, civil, war, to, secure, gains, for, themselves, du, an, s, systematic, offensive, began, in, 1342, and, in, the, end, he, conquered, all, byzantine, territories, in, the, western, balkans, as, far, as, kavala, except, for, the, peloponnesus, and, thessaloniki, which, he, could, not, besiege, due, to, his, small, fleet, there, has, been, speculation, that, du, an, s, ultimate, goal, was, no, less, than, to, conquer, constantinople, and, replace, the, declining, byzantine, empire, with, a, united, orthodox, greco, serbian, empire, under, his, control, in, may, 1344, his, commander, preljub, was, stopped, at, stephaniana, by, a, turkic, force, of, 3, 100, the, turks, won, the, battle, but, the, victory, was, not, enough, to, thwart, the, serbian, conquest, of, macedonia, faced, with, du, an, s, aggression, the, byzantines, sought, allies, in, the, ottoman, turks, whom, they, brought, into, europe, for, the, first, time, in, 1343, du, an, added, of, romans, greeks, to, his, self, styled, title, king, of, serbia, albania, and, the, coast, in, another,

greeks, giving, him, nominal, rule, over, the, serbian, lands, and, although, du, an, was, governing, the, whole, state, he, had, special, responsibility, for, the, eastern, roman, lands, a, further, increase, in, the, byzantinization, of, the, serbian, court, followed, particularly, in, court, ceremonial, and, titles, as, emperor, du, an, could, grant, titles, only, possible, as, an, emperor, in, the, years, that, followed, du, an, s, half, brother, symeon, uro, and, brother, in, law, jovan, asen, became, despotes, jovan, oliver, already, had, the, despot, title, granted, to, him, by,

title, of, caesar, the, raising, of, the, serbian, patriarch, resulted, in, the, same, spirit, as, bishoprics, became, metropolitans, as, for, example, the, metropolitanate, of, skopje, the, serbian, patriarchate, took, over, sovereignty, on, mt, athos, and, the, greek, eparchies, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, while, the, archbishopric, of, ohrid, remained, autocephalous, for, those, acts, he, was, excommunicated, by, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, in, 1350, in, 1347, du, an, conquered, epirus, aetolia, and, acarnania,

needed, a, fleet, knowing, that, fleets, of, southern, serbian, dalmatian, towns, were, not, strong, enough, to, overcome, constantinople, he, opened, negotiations, with, venice, with, which, he, maintained, fairly, good, relations, venice, feared, a, reduction, of, privileges, in, the, empire, if, serbs, became, the, masters, of, constantinople, over, the, weakened, byzantines, but, if, the, venetians, had, allied, with, serbia, du, an, would, have, examined, existing, privileges, once, he, became, master, of, all, byzantine, lands, especially, thessalonika, and, constantinople, the, venetians, would, have, gained, privileges, but, venice, chose, to, avoid, a, military, alliance, while, du, an, sought, venetian, aid, against, byzantium, the, venetians, sought, serbian, support, in, the, struggle, against, the, hungarians, over, dalmatia, when, sensing, that, serbian, aid, would, result, in, a, venetian, obligation, to, serbia, venice, politely, turned, down, du, an, s, offers, of, help, while, du, an, launched, the, bosnian, campaign, absent, the, serbian, troops, in, macedonia, and, thessaly, kantakouzenos, tried, to, regain, lands, byzantium, had, lost, in, his, support, the, constantinopolitan, patriarch, kallistos, excommunicated, du, an, to, discourage, the, greek, population, in, du, an, s, greek, provinces, from, supporting, the, serbian, administration, and, thereby, assist, the, kantakouzenos, campaign, the, excommunication, did, not, stop, du, an, s, relations, with, mount, athos, which, still, addressed, him, as, emperor, though, rather, as, emperor, of, serbs, than, emperor, of, serbs, and, greeks, kantakouzenos, raised, a, small, army, and, took, the, chalcidic, peninsula, then, veria, and, voden, veria, was, the, richest, town, in, the, bottiaea, region, du, an, had, earlier, replaced, many, greeks, with, serbs, including, a, serb, garrison, however, the, remaining, locals, were, able, to, open, the, gates, for, kantakouzenos, in, 1350, voden, resisted, kantakouzenos, but, was, taken, by, assault, kantakouzenos, then, marched, toward, thessaly, but, was, stopped, at, servia, by, caesar, preljub, and, his, army, of, 500, men, the, byzantine, force, retired, to, veria, and, the, aiding, turk, contingent, went, off, plundering, reaching, skopje, once, news, of, the, byzantine, campaign, reached, du, an, in, hum, he, quickly, reassembled, his, forces, from, bosnia, and, hum, and, marched, for, thessaly, when, stefan, du, an, reached, macedonia, byzantine, forces, withrew, to, thrace, du, an, retook, voden, after, short, siege, soon, retaking, veria, and, other, territories, that, kantakouzenos, had, taken, du, an, evidently, wanted, to, expand, his, rule, over, the, provinces, that, had, earlier, been, in, the, hands, of, serbia, such, as, hum, which, was, annexed, by, bosnian, ban, stephen, ii, kotromani, in, 1326, in, 1329, ban, stephen, ii, launched, an, attack, on, lord, vitomir, who, held, travunia, and, konavle, the, bosnian, army, was, defeated, at, pribojska, banja, by, du, an, when, he, was, still, young, king, the, ban, soon, took, over, nevesinje, and, the, rest, of, bosnia, petar, toljenovi, the, lord, of, seaside, hum, and, a, distant, relative, of, du, an, sparked, a, rebellion, against, the, new, ruler, but, he, was, soon, captured, and, died, in, prison, in, 1350, du, an, attacked, bosnia, seeking, to, regain, the, previously, lost, land, of, hum, and, stop, raids, on, his, tributaries, at, konavle, venice, sought, a, settlement, between, the, two, but, failed, in, october, he, invaded, hum, with, an, army, said, to, be, of, 80, 000, men, and, successfully, occupied, part, of, the, disputed, territory, according, to, orbini, du, an, had, secretly, been, in, contact, with, various, bosnian, nobles, offering, them, bribes, for, support, many, nobles, chiefly, of, hum, were, ready, to, betray, the, ban, such, as, the, nikoli, family, which, was, kin, to, the, nemanji, dynasty, the, bosnian, ban, avoided, any, major, confrontation, and, did, not, meet, du, an, in, battle, he, instead, retired, to, the, mountains, and, made, small, hit, and, run, actions, most, of, bosnia, s, fortresses, held, out, but, some, nobles, submitted, to, du, an, the, serbs, ravaged, much, of, the, countryside, with, one, army, they, reached, duvno, and, cetina, another, reached, krka, on, which, lay, knin, modern, croatia, and, another, took, imotski, and, novi, where, they, left, garrisons, and, entered, hum, from, this, position, of, strength, du, an, tried, to, negotiate, peace, with, the, ban, sealing, it, by, the, marriage, of, du, an, s, son, uro, with, stephen, s, daughter, elizabeth, who, would, receive, hum, as, her, dowry, restoring, it, to, serbia, the, ban, was, not, willing, to, consider, this, proposal, du, an, may, have, also, launched, the, campaign, to, aid, his, sister, jelena, who, married, mladen, iii, ubi, of, klis, omi, and, skradin, in, 1347, mladen, died, from, black, death, bubonic, plague, in, 1348, and, jelena, sought, to, maintain, the, rule, of, the, cities, for, herself, and, her, son, she, was, challenged, by, hungary, and, venice, so, the, dispatch, of, serbian, troops, to, western, hum, and, croatia, may, have, been, for, her, aid, as, operations, in, this, region, were, unlikely, to, help, du, an, conquer, hum, if, du, an, had, intended, to, aid, jelena, rising, trouble, in, the, east, precluded, this, pope, clement, vi, in, 1335, addresses, to, king, stefan, du, an, and, request, him, to, stop, the, persecution, and, that, to, the, bishop, of, kotor, which, is, responsible, for, roman, catholic, diocese, of, trebinje, return, monasteries, churches, islands, and, villages, which, some, kings, of, ra, ka, before, him, overtook, in, 1354, du, an, was, attacked, by, hungarians, they, occupied, part, of, northern, serbia, at, this, point, du, an, began, corresponding, with, the, pope, stating, that, he, was, ready, to, recognize, papal, supremacy, since, there, is, no, other, evidence, that, du, an, was, seriously, attracted, to, catholicism, this, was, most, likely, a, diplomatic, action, to, improve, relations, with, papacy, while, serbia, was, endangered, by, hungary, du, an, successfully, repelled, hungarian, invasion, preserving, or, even, extending, his, original, borders, in, the, north, when, hungarians, retreated, from, serbia, he, did, not, continue, the, correspondence, with, the, pope, peace, with, lois, i, of, hungary, was, concluded, in, may, of, 1355, du, an, had, grand, intentions, to, capture, constantinople, and, to, place, himself, at, the, head, of, a, grand, crusading, army, to, drive, the, muslim, turks, from, europe, his, premature, death, created, a, large, power, vacuum, in, the, balkans, that, ultimately, enabled, turkish, invasion, and, turkish, dominance, over, the, balkans, until, the, early, 20th, century, while, mounting, a, crusade, against, the, turks, he, suddenly, died, on, 20, december, 1355, he, was, buried, in, his, foundation, the, monastery, of, the, holy, archangels, near, prizren, his, empire, slowly, crumbled, his, son, and, successor, stefan, uro, v, could, not, keep, the, integrity, of, the, empire, intact, for, long, as, several, feudal, families, immensely, increased, their, power, though, nominally, acknowledging, uro, v, as, emperor, simeon, uro, du, an, s, half, brother, had, proclaimed, himself, emperor, after, the, death, of, du, an, ruling, a, large, area, of, thessaly, and, epirus, which, he, had, received, from, du, an, earlier, today, du, an, s, remains, are, in, the, church, of, saint, mark, in, belgrade, du, an, is, the, only, monarch, of, the, nemanji, dynasty, who, has, not, been, canonised, as, a, saint, much, like, his, ancestors, emperor, du, an, was, very, active, in, renovating, churches, and, monasteries, and, also, for, founding, new, ones, first, he, cared, for, the, monasteries, in, which, his, parents, were, buried, both, the, banjska, monastery, built, by, king, milutin, where, his, mother, was, buried, and, the, monastery, of, visoki, de, ani, an, endowment, of, his, father, were, generously, looked, after, the, monastery, was, built, for, eight, years, and, it, is, certain, that, the, emperor, s, role, in, the, building, process, was, huge, between, 1337, and, 1339, the, emperor, became, ill, and, he, gave, his, word, that, if, he, survived, he, would, build, a, church, and, monastery, in, jerusalem, at, the, time, there, was, one, serbian, monastery, in, jerusalem, dedicated, to, archangel, michael, believed, to, be, founded, by, king, milutin, and, a, number, of, serbian, monks, at, the, sinai, peninsula, his, greatest, endowment, was, the, saint, archangels, monastery, located, near, the, town, of, prizren, in, which, he, was, originally, buried, du, an, gave, many, possessions, to, this, monastery, including, the, forest, of, prizren, which, was, supposed, to, be, a, special, property, of, the, monastery, where, all, precious, goods, and, relics, were, to, be, stored, his, son, stefan, uro, v, did, not, make, peace, with, the, constantinopolitan, patriarch, the, first, initiative, was, made, by, despot, uglje, a, mrnjav, evi, in, 1368, which, resulted, that, the, areas, under, his, rule, were, restored, to, constantinople, the, final, initiative, for, reconciliation, between, the, churches, came, from, prince, lazar, in, 1375, there, is, no, evidence, of, an, existing, cult, of, emperor, du, an, in, the, decades, after, his, death, du, an, s, charter, to, ragusa, dubrovnik, served, as, a, statute, in, the, future, trade, between, serbia, and, ragusa, and, its, regulations, were, deemed, inviolable, emperor, du, an, s, legacy, was, esteemed, in, ragusa, later, folk, tradition, in, serbia, included, various, attitudes, toward, du, an, mostly, negative, made, under, the, influence, of, the, church, du, an, rejected, constantinople, s, claims, to, authority, over, the, serbian, orthodox, church, and, contemplated, a, religious, union, with, the, latin, church, in, 1354, du, an, reached, out, to, the, papal, states, offering, to, recognise, pope, innocent, vi, as, the, father, of, all, christians, and, to, solidify, a, union, between, the, catholic, and, serbian, orthodox, church, in, exchange, for, supporting, du, an, in, his, plans, for, a, military, crusade, against, the, turks, du, an, s, plans, were, welcomed, however, such, plans, never, materialized, due, to, his, death, in, 1355, with, the, raising, of, the, serbian, archbishopric, to, a, patriarchate, serious, changes, in, the, organization, of, the, church, followed, joanikije, ii, became, patriarch, bishoprics, eparchies, were, raised, to, metropolitanates, and, new, territories, of, the, ochrid, archbishopric, and, ecumenical, constantinople, were, added, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, serbian, church, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, had, du, an, excommunicated, in, 1350, although, this, did, not, affect, the, religious, organization, under, serbian, jurisdiction, came, one, of, the, foremost, centers, of, spirituality, mount, athos, as, of, november, 1345, athonite, monks, accept, his, supreme, rule, and, du, an, guaranteed, autonomy, also, giving, a, row, of, economic, privileges, with, tremendous, gifts, and, endowments, the, monks, of, chilandar, the, cradle, of, the, serbian, church, founded, by, saint, sava, his, ancestor, came, at, the, front, of, the, ecclesiastical, community, in, his, codex, du, an, accentuates, his, role, as, a, protector, of, christianity, and, points, out, the, independence, of, the, church, from, the, codex, we, can, also, see, care, that, the, parishes, are, equally, arranged, both, in, cities, and, villages, he, was, also, taking, care, of, few, churches, and, monasteries, from, bari, to, the, west, to, jerusalem, to, the, east, besides, orthodox, christians, there, were, many, catholics, in, the, empire, mostly, in, the, coastal, cities, cattaro, alessio, modern, lezh, etc, in, the, court, of, du, an, there, were, also, catholics, servants, from, cattaro, and, ragusa, mercenaries, guests, etc, in, the, central, parts, saxons, were, in, areas, active, in, mining, and, trading, serbia, under, du, an, claimed, its, identity, through, orthodoxy, and, opposition, to, catholicism, catholics, were, persecuted, especially, catholic, albanians, some, historians, consider, that, the, goal, of, emperor, du, an, was, to, establish, a, new, serbian, greek, empire, replacing, the, byzantine, empire, irkovi, considered, his, initial, ideology, as, that, of, the, previous, bulgarian, emperors, who, had, envisioned, co, rulership, however, starting, in, 1347, relations, with, john, vi, kantakouzenos, worsened, du, an, allied, himself, with, rival, john, v, palaiologos, du, an, was, the, first, serbian, monarch, who, wrote, most, of, his, letters, in, greek, also, signing, with, the, imperial, red, ink, he, was, the, first, to, publish, prostagma, a, kind, of, byzantine, document, characteristic, for, byzantine, rulers, in, his, royal, title, emperor, of, the, serbs, and, greeks, his, claim, as, eastern, roman, byzantine, successor, is, clear, he, also, gave, byzantine, court, titles, to, his, nobility, something, that, would, continue, into, the, 16th, century, du, an, s, empire, was, multinational, with, the, three, most, important, groups, being, serbians, albanians, and, greeks, different, laws, applied, in, the, serbian, and, greek, territories, under, du, an, s, control, but, the, albanians, were, largely, left, to, manage, their, lands, according, to, their, traditional, customs, under, the, leadership, of, their, chiefs, by, allowing, the, greeks, to, retain, much, of, the, landed, property, they, held, under, the, existing, laws, prior, to, du, an, s, conquest, du, an, was, able, to, maintain, order, in, the, greek, territories, and, gain, the, loyalty, of, its, inhabitants, in, conquered, greek, towns, local, greeks, were, given, official, administrative, positions, to, better, manage, the, settlement, without, upsetting, the, local, populace, but, a, serb, governor, would, preside, over, the, administration, and, command, over, a, serb, garrison, to, ensure, that, the, locals, could, not, resist, du, an, s, orders, as, such, existing, byzantine, laws, continued, to, exist, in, the, greek, territories, supplemented, by, specific, edicts, or, charters, issued, by, du, an, himself, similarly, du, an, did, not, transform, the, serbian, and, albanian, territories, under, his, control, by, introducing, a, byzantine, administrative, system, in, serbia, itself, du, an, had, initially, retained, the, existing, tax, system, and, legal, structure, prior, to, du, an, s, reign, the, serbian, state, had, functioned, under, its, customary, law, this, customary, law, was, supplemented, by, saint, sava, in, the, early, 13th, century, in, which, he, added, a, church, canon, law, code, that, covered, many, matters, of, civil, and, family, law, aside, from, these, standard, laws, serbian, rulers, could, also, issue, edicts, for, a, specific, region, or, the, nation, as, a, whole, or, grant, charters, and, privileges, to, monasteries, noblemen, or, merchant, and, miner, communities, du, an, eventually, decided, to, introduce, a, more, general, code, culminating, in, the, introduction, of, du, an, code, in, 1349, for, the, purposes, of, du, an, code, a, wealth, of, charters, were, published, and, some, great, foreign, works, of, law, were, translated, to, serbian, however, the, third, section, of, the, code, was, new, and, distinctively, serbian, albeit, with, byzantine, influence, and, attention, to, a, long, legal, tradition, in, serbia, du, an, explained, the, purpose, of, his, code, in, one, of, in, his, charters, he, intimated, that, its, aims, were, spiritual, and, that, the, code, would, help, his, people, to, save, themselves, for, the, afterlife, the, code, was, proclaimed, on, 21, may, 1349, in, skopje, and, contained, 155, clauses, while, 66, further, clauses, were, added, at, serres, in, 1353, or, 1354, the, authors, of, the, code, are, not, known, but, they, were, probably, members, of, the, court, who, specialised, in, law, du, an, code, proclaims, on, subjects, both, secular, and, ecclesiastic, the, more, so, because, serbia, had, recently, achieved, full, ecclesiastic, autonomy, as, an, independent, orthodox, church, under, a, patriarchate, the, first, 38, clauses, relate, to, the, church, and, they, deal, with, issues, that, the, medieval, serbian, church, faced, while, the, next, 25, clauses, relate, to, the, nobility, civil, law, is, largely, excluded, since, it, was, covered, in, earlier, documents, namely, saint, sava, s, nomokamon, and, in, corpus, juris, civilis, du, an, code, originally, dealt, with, criminal, law, with, heavy, emphasis, on, the, concept, of, lawfulness, which, was, mostly, taken, directly, from, byzantine, law, the, original, manuscript, of, du, an, code, does, not, survive, the, code, continued, as, a, de, facto, constitution, under, the, rule, of, du, an, s, son, stefan, uro, v, and, after, the, fall, of, the, serbian, empire, in, 1371, it, was, used, in, all, the, successor, provinces, it, was, officially, used, in, the, successor, state, serbian, despotate, until, its, annexation, by, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1459, the, code, was, used, as, a, reference, for, serbian, communities, under, turkish, rule, which, exercised, considerable, legal, autonomy, in, civil, cases, the, code, was, also, used, in, the, serbian, autonomical, areas, under, the, republic, of, venice, like, grbalj, and, pa, trovi, i, du, an, code, is, the, first, recorded, code, of, serbian, public, law, and, du, an, hoped, that, its, introduction, would, bring, uniformity, in, serbian, territories, which, were, the, only, portions, of, his, empire, where, the, code, actually, applied, du, an, appointed, serbs, to, the, highest, military, and, civil, positions, within, the, empire, for, a, number, of, reasons, not, only, did, it, allow, him, to, maintain, order, by, having, loyal, subjects, hold, positions, of, power, but, it, also, appeased, the, serb, nobility, which, demanded, rewards, such, as, land, and, positions, of, authority, this, extended, to, the, church, in, which, serbs, were, appointed, to, the, highest, episcopal, positions, thereby, replacing, the, greeks, serbian, tactics, favored, wedge, shaped, heavy, cavalry, attacks, with, horse, archers, on, the, flanks, many, foreign, mercenaries, were, in, the, serbian, army, in, the, 14th, century, mostly, german, knights, and, catalan, halberdiers, du, an, had, his, personal, mercenary, guard, on, his, disposal, consisting, of, german, knights, led, by, palman, commander, of, the, serbian, alemannic, guard, who, upon, crossing, serbia, to, jerusalem, in, 1331, became, leader, of, all, mercenaries, in, the, serbian, army, the, main, strength, of, the, serbian, army, were, their, heavy, cavalry, feared, for, their, ferocious, charge, and, staying, power, the, imperial, army, of, stefan, du, an, was, built, on, existing, military, administration, of, byzantium, although, vlach, cavalry, of, thessaly, was, disbanded, his, army, include, serbian, feudal, forces, albanians, and, greeks, du, an, recruited, light, cavalry, composed, of, 15, 000, albanians, armed, with, spears, and, swords, the, serbian, expansion, in, the, former, territory, of, byzantine, empire, proceeded, without, a, single, major, battle, as, it, was, based, on, besieging, greek, fortifications, the, army, that, du, an, used, to, conquer, northern, greece, consisted, primarily, of, albanians, german, mercenaries, were, also, used, he, was, crowned, young, king, as, heir, apparent, on, 6, january, 1322, but, he, was, too, young, to, really, rule, with, his, father, 1322, and, later, in, april, 1326, du, an, appears, as, the, co, ruler, in, zeta, and, zahumlje, he, was, entitled, the, rule, of, zeta, thus, he, ruled, as, king, of, zeta, in, 1331, he, succeeded, his, father, as, king, of, all, serbian, and, maritime, lands, in, 1343, his, title, was, king, of, serbia, greeks, albania, and, the, coast, in, 1345, he, began, calling, himself, tsar, emperor, and, in, 1345, he, proclaimed, himself, emperor, of, serbs, and, eastern, romans, on, 16, april, 1346, he, was, crowned, emperor, of, serbs, and, greeks, this, title, was, soon, enlarged, into, emperor, and, autocrat, of, the, serbs, and, greeks, the, bulgarians, and, albanians, his, epithet, silni, is, translated, into, the, mighty, but, also, the, great, the, powerful, or, the, strong, stefan, du, an, was, the, most, powerful, serbian, ruler, in, the, middle, ages, and, remains, a, folk, hero, to, serbs, du, an, a, contemporary, of, england, s, edward, iii, is, regarded, with, the, same, reverence, as, the, bulgarians, feel, for, tsar, simeon, i, the, poles, for, sigismund, i, the, old, and, the, czechs, for, charles, iv, according, to, steven, runciman, he, was, perhaps, the, most, powerful, ruler, in, europe, during, the, 14th, century, his, state, was, a, rival, to, the, regional, powers, of, byzantium, and, hungary, and, it, encompassed, a, large, territory, which, would, also, be, his, empire, s, greatest, weakness, by, nature, a, soldier, and, a, conqueror, du, an, also, proved, to, be, very, able, but, nonetheless, feared, ruler, his, empire, however, slowly, crumbled, at, the, hands, of, his, son, as, regional, aristocrats, distanced, from, the, central, rule, the, aim, of, restoring, serbia, as, an, empire, it, once, was, was, one, of, the, greatest, ideals, of, serbs, living, both, in, the, ottoman, and, austro, hungarian, lands, in, 1526, jovan, nenad, in, the, style, of, du, an, proclaimed, himself, emperor, when, ruling, a, short, lived, state, of, serbian, provinces, under, the, crown, of, hungary, the, realm, of, the, slavs, written, by, ragusian, historian, mavro, orbin, l, ca, 1550, 1614, saw, emperor, du, an, s, actions, and, works, positively, the, book, served, as, the, primary, source, about, early, history, of, south, slavs, at, the, time, and, most, of, the, western, historians, drew, their, information, on, the, slavs, from, it, early, serbian, historians, even, though, they, wrote, according, to, the, sources, were, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, the, time, they, lived, in, they, made, efforts, to, harmonize, with, two, different, traditions, one, from, brevets, and, public, documents, and, other, from, genealogies, and, narrative, writings, of, early, historians, most, information, came, from, jovan, raji, 1726, 1801, who, wrote, fifty, pages, about, du, an, s, life, raji, s, work, had, great, influence, on, serbian, culture, of, that, time, and, for, decades, it, was, the, main, source, of, information, about, serbian, history, after, the, restoration, of, serbia, in, the, 19th, century, continuity, with, the, serbian, middle, ages, was, accentuated, particularly, of, its, greatest, moment, during, emperor, du, an, a, political, agenda, as, with, a, restoration, of, his, empire, would, find, its, place, in, the, political, programmes, of, the, principality, of, serbia, notably, the, na, ertanije, by, ilija, gara, anin, by, his, wife, helena, of, bulgaria, emperor, du, an, had, at, least, a, son, stefan, uro, v, who, succeeded, his, father, as, emperor, r, 1355, 1371, du, an, and, helena, also, had, a, daughter, theodora, who, in, 1351, at, twelve, married, the, ottoman, sultan, orhan, theodora, most, likely, died, between, 1352, and, 1354, according, to, nicephorus, gregoras, du, an, was, negotiating, a, potential, alliance, with, orhan, which, would, have, involved, marrying, off, his, daughter, to, orhan, himself, or, one, of, orhan, s, sons, in, 1351, with, the, aim, of, signing, a, truce, between, their, kingdoms, however, after, the, serbian, emissaries, were, attacked, by, nikephoros, orsini, serbia, and, the, ottoman, empire, resumed, hostilities, some, historians, speculate, that, the, couple, had, another, child, a, daughter, j, fine, suggested, that, it, might, be, irina, or, irene, the, wife, of, caesar, preljub, governor, of, thessaly, d, 1355, 1356, mother, of, thomas, preljubovi, ruler, of, epirus, 1367,
