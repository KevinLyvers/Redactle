in, january, 1593, the, war, elephants, of, naresuan, chaophraya, chaiyanuphap, and, ekathotsarot, chaophraya, prap, traichak, were, in, musth, and, charged, into, the, midst, of, the, burmese, with,

chao, phraya, which, defeated, a, hundred, thousand, soldiers, still, exist, today, naresuan, built, a, pagoda, on, the, site, of, the, elephant, battle, as, a, victory, monument, 134, naresuan, brought, before, a, council, of, judges, those, commanders, he, thought, had, disobeyed, him, or, were, negligent, in, their, duties, they, had, been, unable, to, follow, him, into, the, middle, of, the, burmese, the, punishment, was, death, however, somdet, phra, phanarat, a, bhikkhu, from, wat, yai, chai, mongkhon, calmed, naresuan, enough, to, have, the, punishment, rescinded, instead, the, guilty, commanders, were, ordered, to, take, dawei, and, tanintharyi, for, redemption, 136, 138, the, burmese, chronicles, however, do, not, mention, a, duel, at, all, they, say, that, the, two, armies, engage, in, a, battle, on, 8, january, 1593, and, swa, was, felled, by, a, shot, from, a, siamese, firearm, according, to, terwiel, there, are, ten, different, accounts, of, the, battle, by, indigenous, european, and, persian, authors, four, siamese, one, burmese, four, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, european, accounts, and, late, 17th, century, one, persian, account, only, one, siamese, account, says, there, was, a, formal, elephant, duel, between, naresuan, and, swa, however, jeremias, van, vliet, s, account, of, siam, in, early, 1630s, includes, interviews, with, siamese, subjects, who, were, contemporaries, of, king, naresuan, and, who, insisted, that, the, elephant, combat, which, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, burmese, crown, prince, at, the, hands, of, naresuan, whom, the, siamese, called, the, black, prince, did, indeed, happen, according, to, van, vliet, s, description, of, the, siamese, kingdom, hen, the, pegu, prince, and, the, young, siamese, prince, both, seated, on, elephants, and, dressed, in, royal, garb, lost, all, self, control, left, both, armies, and, attacked, each, other, furiously, the, siamese, prince, ran, his, adversary, with, his, lance, through, the, body, and, took, the, other, s, elephant, in, terwiel, s, analysis, of, the, other, accounts, however, the, burmese, crown, prince, and, naresuan, both, fought, on, their, war, elephant, in, the, battle, although, no, formal, duel, probably, ever, took, place, per, terwiel, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, swa, would, have, agreed, to, a, formal, duel, since, agreeing, to, do, so, would, have, jeopardized, the, costly, invasion, that, had, thus, far, progressed, without, a, hitch, during, the, battle, naresuan, s, elephant, got, surrounded, by, the, burmese, forces, during, that, crucial, moment, a, burmese, war, elephant, went, musth, and, attacked, swa, s, elephant, seeing, that, swa, was, in, difficulty, naresuan, closed, in, and, he, or, one, of, the, warriors, riding, with, him, maybe, a, portuguese, fired, a, gun, which, mortally, wounded, the, crown, prince, swa, naresuan, was, lucky, to, escape, from, a, very, dangerous, situation, but, also, quick, to, take, advantage, of, it, according, to, terwiel, the, burmese, and, european, accounts, stayed, closer, to, what, actually, may, have, happened, and, naresuan, s, much, repeated, challenge, to, hold, a, duel, even, though, it, looms, large, in, many, thai, history, books, should, be, relegated, to, a, legendary, tale, in, 1593, naresuan, sent, chao, phraya, chakri, and, phraya, phra, khlang, to, attack, tanintharyi, and, dawei, a, mon, city, which, fell, after, 15, and, 20, day, sieges, respectfully, nanda, bayin, launched, a, burmese, fleet, to, defend, those, cities, but, arrived, too, late, and, was, defeated, by, a, combined, thai, fleet, additionally, burmese, troops, marching, from, mottama, were, ambushed, by, the, combined, chakri, and, khlang, force, resulting, in, the, capture, of, 11, burmese, commanders, many, elephants, horses, men, arms, and, ammunition, 138, 143, in, 1593, naresuan, then, launched, a, successful, campaign, to, subjugate, cambodia, he, was, said, to, have, executed, its, king, nakphra, sattha, but, this, account, is, unlikely, to, be, true, since, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, this, claim, and, historical, accounts, in, cambodia, as, well, as, from, spanish, and, portuguese, explorers, say, that, nakphra, sattha, escaped, to, vientiane, where, he, remained, until, he, died, naresuan, then, brought, khmer, families, to, populate, his, northern, provinces, 143, 144, as, burmese, control, over, the, tributaries, had, weakened, the, mons, took, this, opportunity, to, free, themselves, the, mon, governor, of, mawlamyine, rebelled, against, bago, and, requested, siamese, support, naresuan, sent, troops, to, help, and, the, burmese, abandoned, their, garrison, at, martaban, nanda, bayin, then, sent, the, viceroy, of, taungoo, to, suppress, the, uprising, but, his, force, was, defeated, the, mon, provinces, then, became, subject, to, the, siamese, kingdom, 145, 147, naresuan, then, decided, to, attack, bago, in, 1595, he, laid, siege, on, the, city, for, three, months, before, retreating, when, the, viceroys, of, prome, taungoo, and, ava, sent, relief, forces, naresuan, did, take, back, many, prisoners, of, war, lessening, the, fighting, strength, of, the, burmese, 148, 150, the, lord, of, prome, staged, a, rebellion, against, nanda, bayin, in, 1595, followed, by, taungoo, rakhine, lan, na, and, lan, xang, king, nokeo, koumane, of, lan, xang, prepared, to, march, through, lan, na, to, bago, to, rescue, the, people, of, lan, xang, held, captive, the, viceroy, of, lan, na, chiang, mai, then, submitted, his, territory, to, siamese, control, and, naresuan, sent, siamese, forces, to, prevent, laotian, forces, from, entering, lan, na, 151, 155, after, these, series, of, upheavals, in, the, burmese, empire, naresuan, decided, to, attack, bago, again, in, 1599, using, arakan, and, taungoo, as, allies, however, before, naresuan, arrived, at, the, city, the, forces, of, arakan, and, taungoo, had, already, invested, the, city, the, viceroy, of, taungoo, ended, up, taking, the, populace, back, to, taungoo, abandoning, the, city, to, the, forces, of, arakan, to, loot, what, property, was, left, behind, and, then, setting, flames, to, the, palace, and, monasteries, 156, 162, naresuan, occupied, bago, while, minye, thihathu, ii, viceroy, of, taungoo, had, already, taken, nanda, bayin, to, taungoo, naresuan, requested, minye, thihathu, send, nanda, bayin, back, to, him, but, minye, thihathu, refused, stating, he, was, unwell, after, that, naresuan, laid, siege, to, taungoo, for, two, months, but, retreated, due, to, lack, of, food, 162, 166, natshinnaung, killed, nanda, bayin, while, he, was, held, captive, in, toungoo, nyaungyan, min, then, crowned, himself, as, the, king, of, ava, to, counter, the, viceroys, of, toungoo, and, prome, siam, was, then, free, of, a, burmese, threat, for, four, years, until, the, king, of, ava, went, on, a, campaign, to, subjugate, the, shans, when, he, advanced, as, far, as, theinni, naresuan, raised, an, army, of, 200, 000, men, to, counter, the, threat, to, his, kingdom, he, advanced, as, far, as, the, fang, district, of, chiang, mai, province, before, falling, ill, and, then, died, after, three, days, on, 25, april, 1605, his, brother, king, ekathotsarot, became, his, successor, as, king, 173, 180, recent, studies, of, burmese, records, by, historians, of, silpakorn, university, showed, that, he, returned, to, wiang, haeng, where, he, died, of, disease, probably, smallpox, many, shan, believe, king, naresuan, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, interred, in, a, stupa, in, mongton, in, the, daen, lao, range, in, the, southern, part, of, the, shan, state, according, to, damrong, rajanubhab, naresuan, was, recorded, as, a, brave, and, glorious, king, therefore, his, glory, is, evident, up, to, the, present, day, the, kingdom, of, siam, at, that, period, was, widest, in, extent, opulent, and, redounding, in, glory, 178
