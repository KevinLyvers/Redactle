jean, baptiste, pierre, antoine, de, monet, chevalier, de, lamarck, 1, august, 1744, 18, december, 1829, often, known, simply, as, lamarck, l, m, r, k, french, was, a, french, naturalist, biologist, academic, and, soldier, he, was, an, early, proponent, of, the, idea, that, biological, evolution, occurred, and, proceeded, in, accordance, with, natural, laws, lamarck, fought, in, the, seven, years, war, against, prussia, and, was, awarded, a, commission, for, bravery, on, the, battlefield, posted, to, monaco, lamarck, became, interested, in, natural, history, and, resolved, to, study, medicine, he, retired, from, the, army, after, being, injured, in, 1766, and, returned, to, his, medical, studies, lamarck, developed, a, particular, interest, in, botany, and, later, after, he, published, the, three, volume, work, flore, fran, oise, 1778, he, gained, membership, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1779, lamarck, became, involved, in, the, jardin, des, plantes, and, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, botany, in, 1788, when, the, french, national, assembly, founded, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, 1793, lamarck, became, a, professor, of, zoology, in, 1801, he, published, syst, me, des, animaux, sans, vert, bres, a, major, work, on, the, classification, of, invertebrates, a, term, which, he, coined, in, an, 1802, publication, he, became, one, of, the, first, to, use, the, term, biology, in, its, modern, sense, lamarck, continued, his, work, as, a, premier, authority, on, invertebrate, zoology, he, is, remembered, at, least, in, malacology, as, a, taxonomist, of, considerable, stature, the, modern, era, generally, remembers, lamarck, for, a, theory, of, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, called, lamarckism, inaccurately, named, after, him, soft, inheritance, or, use, disuse, theory, which, he, described, in, his, 1809, philosophie, zoologique, however, the, idea, of, soft, inheritance, long, antedates, him, formed, only, a, small, element, of, his, theory, of, evolution, and, was, in, his, time, accepted, by, many, natural, historians, lamarck, s, contribution, to, evolutionary, theory, consisted, of, the, first, truly, cohesive, theory, of, biological, evolution, in, which, an, alchemical, complexifying, force, drove, organisms, up, a, ladder, of, complexity, and, a, second, environmental, force, adapted, them, to, local, environments, through, use, and, disuse, of, characteristics, differentiating, them, from, other, organisms, scientists, have, debated, whether, advances, in, the, field, of, transgenerational, epigenetics, mean, that, lamarck, was, to, an, extent, correct, or, not, jean, baptiste, lamarck, was, born, in, bazentin, picardy, northern, france, as, the, 11th, child, in, an, impoverished, aristocratic, family, male, members, of, the, lamarck, family, had, traditionally, served, in, the, french, army, lamarck, s, eldest, brother, was, killed, in, combat, at, the, siege, of, bergen, op, zoom, and, two, other, brothers, were, still, in, service, when, lamarck, was, in, his, teenaged, years, yielding, to, the, wishes, of, his, father, lamarck, enrolled, in, a, jesuit, college, in, amiens, in, the, late, 1750s, after, his, father, died, in, 1760, lamarck, bought, himself, a, horse, and, rode, across, the, country, to, join, the, french, army, which, was, in, germany, at, the, time, lamarck, showed, great, physical, courage, on, the, battlefield, in, the, seven, years, war, with, prussia, and, he, was, even, nominated, for, the, lieutenancy, lamarck, s, company, was, left, exposed, to, the, direct, artillery, fire, of, their, enemies, and, was, quickly, reduced, to, just, 14, men, with, no, officers, one, of, the, men, suggested, that, the, puny, 17, year, old, volunteer, should, assume, command, and, order, a, withdrawal, from, the, field, although, lamarck, accepted, command, he, insisted, they, remain, where, they, had, been, posted, until, relieved, when, their, colonel, reached, the, remains, of, their, company, this, display, of, courage, and, loyalty, impressed, him, so, much, that, lamarck, was, promoted, to, officer, on, the, spot, however, when, one, of, his, comrades, playfully, lifted, him, by, the, head, he, sustained, an, inflammation, in, the, lymphatic, glands, of, the, neck, and, he, was, sent, to, paris, to, receive, treatment, he, was, awarded, a, commission, and, settled, at, his, post, in, monaco, there, he, encountered, trait, des, plantes, usuelles, a, botany, book, by, james, francis, chomel, with, a, reduced, pension, of, only, 400, francs, a, year, lamarck, resolved, to, pursue, a, profession, he, attempted, to, study, medicine, and, supported, himself, by, working, in, a, bank, office, lamarck, studied, medicine, for, four, years, but, gave, it, up, under, his, elder, brother, s, persuasion, he, was, interested, in, botany, especially, after, his, visits, to, the, jardin, du, roi, and, he, became, a, student, under, bernard, de, jussieu, a, notable, french, naturalist, under, jussieu, lamarck, spent, 10, years, studying, french, flora, in, 1776, he, wrote, his, first, scientific, essay, a, chemical, treatise, after, his, studies, in, 1778, he, published, some, of, his, observations, and, results, in, a, three, volume, work, entitled, flore, fran, aise, lamarck, s, work, was, respected, by, many, scholars, and, it, launched, him, into, prominence, in, french, science, on, 8, august, 1778, lamarck, married, marie, anne, rosalie, delaporte, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, one, of, the, top, french, scientists, of, the, day, mentored, lamarck, and, helped, him, gain, membership, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1779, and, a, commission, as, a, royal, botanist, in, 1781, in, which, he, traveled, to, foreign, botanical, gardens, and, museums, lamarck, s, first, son, andr, was, born, on, 22, april, 1781, and, he, made, his, colleague, andr, thouin, the, child, s, godfather, in, his, two, years, of, travel, lamarck, collected, rare, plants, that, were, not, available, in, the, royal, garden, and, also, other, objects, of, natural, history, such, as, minerals, and, ores, that, were, not, found, in, french, museums, on, 7, january, 1786, his, second, son, antoine, was, born, and, lamarck, chose, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, bernard, de, jussieu, s, nephew, as, the, boy, s, godfather, on, 21, april, the, following, year, charles, ren, lamarck, s, third, son, was, born, ren, louiche, desfontaines, a, professor, of, botany, at, the, royal, garden, was, the, boy, s, godfather, and, lamarck, s, elder, sister, marie, charlotte, pelagie, de, monet, was, the, godmother, in, 1788, buffon, s, successor, at, the, position, of, intendant, of, the, royal, garden, charles, claude, flahaut, de, la, billaderie, comte, d, angiviller, created, a, position, for, lamarck, with, a, yearly, salary, of, 1, 000, francs, as, the, keeper, of, the, herbarium, of, the, royal, garden, in, 1790, at, the, height, of, the, french, revolution, lamarck, changed, the, name, of, the, royal, garden, from, jardin, du, roi, to, jardin, des, plantes, a, name, that, did, not, imply, such, a, close, association, with, king, louis, xvi, lamarck, had, worked, as, the, keeper, of, the, herbarium, for, five, years, before, he, was, appointed, curator, and, professor, of, invertebrate, zoology, at, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, 1793, during, his, time, at, the, herbarium, lamarck, s, wife, gave, birth, to, three, more, children, before, dying, on, 27, september, 1792, with, the, official, title, of, professeur, d, histoire, naturelle, des, insectes, et, des, vers, lamarck, received, a, salary, of, nearly, 2, 500, francs, per, year, the, following, year, on, 9, october, he, married, charlotte, reverdy, who, was, 30, years, his, junior, on, 26, september, 1794, lamarck, was, appointed, to, serve, as, secretary, of, the, assembly, of, professors, for, the, museum, for, a, period, of, one, year, in, 1797, charlotte, died, and, he, married, julie, mallet, the, following, year, she, died, in, 1819, in, his, first, six, years, as, professor, lamarck, published, only, one, paper, in, 1798, on, the, influence, of, the, moon, on, the, earth, s, atmosphere, lamarck, began, as, an, essentialist, who, believed, species, were, unchanging, however, after, working, on, the, molluscs, of, the, paris, basin, he, grew, convinced, that, transmutation, or, change, in, the, nature, of, a, species, occurred, over, time, he, set, out, to, develop, an, explanation, and, on, 11, may, 1800, the, 21st, day, of, floreal, year, viii, in, the, revolutionary, timescale, used, in, france, at, the, time, he, presented, a, lecture, at, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, which, he, first, outlined, his, newly, developing, ideas, about, evolution, in, 1801, he, published, syst, me, des, animaux, sans, vert, bres, a, major, work, on, the, classification, of, invertebrates, in, the, work, he, introduced, definitions, of, natural, groups, among, invertebrates, he, categorized, echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans, and, annelids, which, he, separated, from, the, old, taxon, for, worms, known, as, vermes, lamarck, was, the, first, to, separate, arachnids, from, insects, in, classification, and, he, moved, crustaceans, into, a, separate, class, from, insects, in, 1802, lamarck, published, hydrog, ologie, and, became, one, of, the, first, to, use, the, term, biology, in, its, modern, sense, in, hydrog, ologie, lamarck, advocated, a, steady, state, geology, based, on, a, strict, uniformitarianism, he, argued, that, global, currents, tended, to, flow, from, east, to, west, and, continents, eroded, on, their, eastern, borders, with, the, material, carried, across, to, be, deposited, on, the, western, borders, thus, the, earth, s, continents, marched, steadily, westward, around, the, globe, that, year, he, also, published, recherches, sur, l, organisation, des, corps, vivants, in, which, he, drew, out, his, theory, on, evolution, he, believed, that, all, life, was, organized, in, a, vertical, chain, with, gradation, between, the, lowest, forms, and, the, highest, forms, of, life, thus, demonstrating, a, path, to, progressive, developments, in, nature, in, his, own, work, lamarck, had, favored, the, then, more, traditional, theory, based, on, the, classical, four, elements, during, lamarck, s, lifetime, he, became, controversial, attacking, the, more, enlightened, chemistry, proposed, by, lavoisier, he, also, came, into, conflict, with, the, widely, respected, palaeontologist, georges, cuvier, who, was, not, a, supporter, of, evolution, according, to, peter, j, bowler, cuvier, ridiculed, lamarck, s, theory, of, transformation, and, defended, the, fixity, of, species, according, to, martin, j, s, rudwick, cuvier, was, clearly, hostile, to, the, materialistic, overtones, of, current, transformist, theorizing, but, it, does, not, necessarily, follow, that, he, regarded, species, origin, as, supernatural, certainly, he, was, careful, to, use, neutral, language, to, refer, to, the, causes, of, the, origins, of, new, forms, of, life, and, even, of, man, lamarck, gradually, turned, blind, he, died, in, paris, on, 18, december, 1829, when, he, died, his, family, was, so, poor, they, had, to, apply, to, the, academie, for, financial, assistance, lamarck, was, buried, in, a, common, grave, of, the, montparnasse, cemetery, for, just, five, years, according, to, the, grant, obtained, from, relatives, later, the, body, was, dug, up, along, with, other, remains, and, was, lost, lamarck, s, books, and, the, contents, of, his, home, were, sold, at, auction, and, his, body, was, buried, in, a, temporary, lime, pit, after, his, death, cuvier, used, the, form, of, a, eulogy, to, denigrate, lamarck, loge, of, lamarck, is, one, of, the, most, deprecatory, and, chillingly, partisan, biographies, i, have, ever, read, though, he, was, supposedly, writing, respectful, comments, in, the, old, tradition, of, de, mortuis, nil, nisi, bonum, while, he, was, working, on, hydrog, ologie, 1802, lamarck, had, the, idea, to, apply, the, principle, of, erosion, to, biology, this, led, him, to, the, basic, principle, of, evolution, which, saw, the, fluids, in, organs, inheriting, more, complex, forms, and, functions, thus, passing, on, these, traits, to, the, organism, s, descendants, this, was, a, reversal, from, lamarck, s, previous, view, published, in, his, memoirs, of, physics, and, natural, history, 1797, in, which, he, briefly, refers, to, the, immutability, of, species, lamarck, stressed, two, main, themes, in, his, biological, work, neither, of, them, to, do, with, soft, inheritance, the, first, was, that, the, environment, gives, rise, to, changes, in, animals, he, cited, examples, of, blindness, in, moles, the, presence, of, teeth, in, mammals, and, the, absence, of, teeth, in, birds, as, evidence, of, this, principle, the, second, principle, was, that, life, was, structured, in, an, orderly, manner, and, that, many, different, parts, of, all, bodies, make, possible, the, organic, movements, of, animals, although, he, was, not, the, first, thinker, to, advocate, organic, evolution, he, was, the, first, to, develop, a, truly, coherent, evolutionary, theory, he, outlined, his, theories, regarding, evolution, first, in, his, floreal, lecture, of, 1800, and, then, in, three, later, published, works, lamarck, employed, several, mechanisms, as, drivers, of, evolution, drawn, from, the, common, knowledge, of, his, day, and, from, his, own, belief, in, the, chemistry, before, lavoisier, he, used, these, mechanisms, to, explain, the, two, forces, he, saw, as, constituting, evolution, force, driving, animals, from, simple, to, complex, forms, and, a, force, adapting, animals, to, their, local, environments, and, differentiating, them, from, each, other, he, believed, that, these, forces, must, be, explained, as, a, necessary, consequence, of, basic, physical, principles, favoring, a, materialistic, attitude, toward, biology, lamarck, referred, to, a, tendency, for, organisms, to, become, more, complex, moving, up, a, ladder, of, progress, he, referred, to, this, phenomenon, as, le, pouvoir, de, la, vie, or, la, force, qui, tend, sans, cesse, composer, l, organisation, the, force, that, perpetually, tends, to, make, order, lamarck, believed, in, the, ongoing, spontaneous, generation, of, simple, living, organisms, through, action, on, physical, matter, by, a, material, life, force, lamarck, ran, against, the, modern, chemistry, promoted, by, lavoisier, whose, ideas, he, regarded, with, disdain, preferring, to, embrace, a, more, traditional, alchemical, view, of, the, elements, as, influenced, primarily, by, earth, air, fire, and, water, he, asserted, that, once, living, organisms, form, the, movements, of, fluids, in, living, organisms, naturally, drove, them, to, evolve, toward, ever, greater, levels, of, complexity, the, rapid, motion, of, fluids, will, etch, canals, between, delicate, tissues, soon, their, flow, will, begin, to, vary, leading, to, the, emergence, of, distinct, organs, the, fluids, themselves, now, more, elaborate, will, become, more, complex, engendering, a, greater, variety, of, secretions, and, substances, composing, the, organs, he, argued, that, organisms, thus, moved, from, simple, to, complex, in, a, steady, predictable, way, based, on, the, fundamental, physical, principles, of, alchemy, in, this, view, simple, organisms, never, disappeared, because, they, were, constantly, being, created, by, spontaneous, generation, in, what, has, been, described, as, a, steady, state, biology, lamarck, saw, spontaneous, generation, as, being, ongoing, with, the, simple, organisms, thus, created, being, transmuted, over, time, becoming, more, complex, he, is, sometimes, regarded, as, believing, in, a, teleological, goal, oriented, process, where, organisms, became, more, perfect, as, they, evolved, though, as, a, materialist, he, emphasized, that, these, forces, must, originate, necessarily, from, underlying, physical, principles, according, to, the, paleontologist, henry, fairfield, osborn, lamarck, denied, absolutely, the, existence, of, any, perfecting, tendency, in, nature, and, regarded, evolution, as, the, final, necessary, effect, of, surrounding, conditions, on, life, charles, coulston, gillispie, a, historian, of, science, has, written, life, is, a, purely, physical, phenomenon, in, lamarck, and, argued, that, lamarck, s, views, should, not, be, confused, with, the, vitalist, school, of, thought, the, second, component, of, lamarck, s, theory, of, evolution, was, the, adaptation, of, organisms, to, their, environment, this, could, move, organisms, upward, from, the, ladder, of, progress, into, new, and, distinct, forms, with, local, adaptations, it, could, also, drive, organisms, into, evolutionary, blind, alleys, where, the, organism, became, so, finely, adapted, that, no, further, change, could, occur, lamarck, argued, that, this, adaptive, force, was, powered, by, the, interaction, of, organisms, with, their, environment, by, the, use, and, disuse, of, certain, characteristics, the, last, clause, of, this, law, introduces, what, is, now, called, soft, inheritance, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, or, simply, lamarckism, though, it, forms, only, a, part, of, lamarck, s, thinking, however, in, the, field, of, epigenetics, evidence, is, growing, that, soft, inheritance, plays, a, part, in, the, changing, of, some, organisms, phenotypes, it, leaves, the, genetic, material, dna, unaltered, thus, not, violating, the, central, dogma, of, biology, but, prevents, the, expression, of, genes, such, as, by, methylation, to, modify, dna, transcription, this, can, be, produced, by, changes, in, behaviour, and, environment, many, epigenetic, changes, are, heritable, to, a, degree, thus, while, dna, itself, is, not, directly, altered, by, the, environment, and, behavior, except, through, selection, the, relationship, of, the, genotype, to, the, phenotype, can, be, altered, even, across, generations, by, experience, within, the, lifetime, of, an, individual, this, has, led, to, calls, for, biology, to, reconsider, lamarckian, processes, in, evolution, in, light, of, modern, advances, in, molecular, biology, in, his, book, philosophie, zoologique, lamarck, referred, to, god, as, the, sublime, author, of, nature, lamarck, s, religious, views, are, examined, in, the, book, lamarck, the, founder, of, evolution, 1901, by, alpheus, packard, according, to, packard, from, lamarck, s, writings, he, may, be, regarded, as, a, deist, the, philosopher, of, biology, michael, ruse, described, lamarck, as, believing, in, god, as, an, unmoved, mover, creator, of, the, world, and, its, laws, who, refuses, to, intervene, miraculously, in, his, creation, biographer, james, moore, described, lamarck, as, a, thoroughgoing, deist, the, historian, jacques, roger, has, written, lamarck, was, a, materialist, to, the, extent, that, he, did, not, consider, it, necessary, to, have, recourse, to, any, spiritual, principle, his, deism, remained, vague, and, his, idea, of, creation, did, not, prevent, him, from, believing, everything, in, nature, including, the, highest, forms, of, life, was, but, the, result, of, natural, processes, lamarck, is, known, largely, for, his, views, on, evolution, which, have, been, dismissed, in, favour, of, developments, in, darwinism, his, theory, of, evolution, only, achieved, fame, after, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, 1859, which, spurred, critics, of, darwin, s, new, theory, to, fall, back, on, lamarckian, evolution, as, a, more, well, established, alternative, lamarck, is, usually, remembered, for, his, belief, in, the, then, commonly, held, theory, of, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, and, the, use, and, disuse, model, by, which, organisms, developed, their, characteristics, lamarck, incorporated, this, belief, into, his, theory, of, evolution, along, with, other, common, beliefs, of, the, time, such, as, spontaneous, generation, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, also, called, the, theory, of, adaptation, or, soft, inheritance, was, rejected, by, august, weismann, in, the, 1880s, when, he, developed, a, theory, of, inheritance, in, which, germ, plasm, the, sex, cells, later, redefined, as, dna, remained, separate, and, distinct, from, the, soma, the, rest, of, the, body, thus, nothing, which, happens, to, the, soma, may, be, passed, on, with, the, germ, plasm, this, model, allegedly, underlies, the, modern, understanding, of, inheritance, lamarck, constructed, one, of, the, first, theoretical, frameworks, of, organic, evolution, while, this, theory, was, generally, rejected, during, his, lifetime, stephen, jay, gould, argues, that, lamarck, was, the, primary, evolutionary, theorist, in, that, his, ideas, and, the, way, in, which, he, structured, his, theory, set, the, tone, for, much, of, the, subsequent, thinking, in, evolutionary, biology, through, to, the, present, day, developments, in, epigenetics, the, study, of, cellular, and, physiological, traits, that, are, heritable, by, daughter, cells, and, not, caused, by, changes, in, the, dna, sequence, have, caused, debate, about, whether, a, neolamarckist, view, of, inheritance, could, be, correct, lamarck, was, not, in, a, position, to, give, a, molecular, explanation, for, his, theory, eva, jablonka, and, marion, lamb, for, example, call, themselves, neolamarckists, reviewing, the, evidence, david, haig, argued, that, any, such, mechanisms, must, themselves, have, evolved, through, natural, selection, darwin, allowed, a, role, for, use, and, disuse, as, an, evolutionary, mechanism, subsidiary, to, natural, selection, most, often, in, respect, of, disuse, he, praised, lamarck, for, the, eminent, service, of, arousing, attention, to, the, probability, of, all, change, in, the, organic, world, being, the, result, of, law, not, miraculous, interposition, lamarckism, is, also, occasionally, used, to, describe, quasi, evolutionary, concepts, in, societal, contexts, though, not, by, lamarck, himself, for, example, the, memetic, theory, of, cultural, evolution, is, sometimes, described, as, a, form, of, lamarckian, inheritance, of, nongenetic, traits, during, his, lifetime, lamarck, named, a, large, number, of, species, many, of, which, have, become, synonyms, the, world, register, of, marine, species, gives, no, fewer, than, 1, 634, records, the, indo, pacific, molluscan, database, gives, 1, 781, records, among, these, are, some, well, known, families, such, as, the, ark, clams, arcidae, the, sea, hares, aplysiidae, and, the, cockles, cardiidae, the, international, plant, names, index, gives, 58, records, including, a, number, of, well, known, genera, such, as, the, mosquito, fern, azolla, the, honeybee, subspecies, apis, mellifera, lamarckii, is, named, after, lamarck, as, well, as, the, bluefire, jellyfish, cyaneia, lamarckii, a, number, of, plants, have, also, been, named, after, him, including, amelanchier, lamarckii, juneberry, digitalis, lamarckii, and, aconitum, lamarckii, as, well, as, the, grass, genus, lamarckia, the, international, plant, names, index, gives, 116, records, of, plant, species, named, after, lamarck, among, the, marine, species, no, fewer, than, 103, species, or, genera, carry, the, epithet, lamarcki, lamarckii, or, lamarckiana, but, many, have, since, become, synonyms, marine, species, with, valid, names, include, on, invertebrate, classification
