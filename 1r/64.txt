dryads, her, performance, drew, praise, from, the, critics, particularly, nikolai, bezobrazov, at, the, height, of, petipa, s, strict, academicism, the, public, was, taken, aback, by, pavlova, s, style, a, combination, of, a, gift, that, paid, little, heed, to, academic, rules, she, frequently, performed, with, bent, knees, bad, turnout, misplaced, port, de, bras, and, incorrectly, placed, tours, such, a, style, in, many, ways, harked, back, to, the, time, of, the, romantic, ballet, and, the, great, ballerinas, of, old, pavlova, performed, in, various, classical, variations, pas, de, deux, and, pas, de, trois, in, such, ballets, as, la, camargo, le, roi, candaule, marcobomba, and, the, sleeping, beauty, her, enthusiasm, often, led, her, astray, once, during, a, performance, as,

to, difficulty, while, performing, as, the, fairy, candide, in, petipa, s, the, sleeping, beauty, leading, the, ballerina, to, revise, the, fairy, s, jumps, en, pointe, much, to, the, surprise, of, the, ballet, master, she, tried, desperately, to, imitate, the, renowned, pierina, legnani, prima, ballerina, assoluta, of, the, imperial, theaters, once, during, class, she, attempted, legnani, s, famous, fouett, s, causing, her, teacher, pavel, gerdt, to, fly, into, a, rage, he, told, her, leave, acrobatics, to, others, it, is, positively, more, than, i, can, bear, to, see, the, pressure, such, steps, put, on, your, delicate, muscles, and, the, severe, arch, of, your, foot, i, beg, you, to, never, again, try, to, imitate, those, who, are, physically, stronger, than, you, you, must, realize, that, your, daintiness, and, fragility, are, your, greatest, assets, you, should, always, do, the, kind, of, dancing, which, brings, out, your, own, rare, qualities, instead, of, trying, to, win, praise, by, mere, acrobatic, tricks, pavlova, rose, through, the, ranks, quickly, becoming, a, favorite, of, the, old, maestro, petipa, from, him, she, learned, the, title, role, in, paquita,

because, of, her, small, ankles, and, lithe, legs, instead, audiences, became, enchanted, with, pavlova, and, her, frail, ethereal, look, which, fitted, the, role, perfectly, particularly, in, the, scene, the, kingdom, of, the, shades, pavlova, is, perhaps, most, renowned, for, creating, the, role, of, the, dying, swan, a, solo, choreographed, for, her, by, michel, fokine, the, ballet, created,
