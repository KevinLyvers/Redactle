hans, christian, rsted, formemrs, frse, r, s, t, d, danish, often, rendered, oersted, in, english, 14, august, 1777, 9, march, 1851, was, a, danish, physicist, and, chemist, who, discovered, that, electric, currents, create, magnetic, fields, which, was, the, first, connection, found, between, electricity, and, magnetism, oersted, s, law, and, the, oersted, unit, oe, are, named, after, him, a, leader, of, the, danish, golden, age, rsted, was, a, close, friend, of, hans, christian, andersen, and, the, brother, of, politician, and, jurist, anders, sand, e, rsted, who, served, as, prime, minister, of, denmark, from, 1853, to, 1854, rsted, was, born, in, rudk, bing, in, 1777, as, a, young, boy, he, developed, an, interest, in, science, while, working, for, his, father, who, was, a, pharmacist, in, the, town, s, pharmacy, he, and, his, brother, anders, received, most, of, their, early, education, through, self, study, at, home, going, to, copenhagen, in, 1793, to, take, entrance, exams, for, the, university, of, copenhagen, where, both, brothers, excelled, academically, by, 1796, rsted, had, been, awarded, honors, for, his, papers, in, both, aesthetics, and, physics, he, earned, his, doctorate, in, 1799, for, a, dissertation, based, on, the, works, of, kant, entitled, the, architectonics, of, natural, metaphysics, in, 1800, alessandro, volta, reported, his, invention, of, the, voltaic, pile, which, inspired, rsted, to, investigate, the, nature, of, electricity, and, to, conduct, his, first, electrical, experiments, in, 1801, rsted, received, a, travel, scholarship, and, public, grant, which, enabled, him, to, spend, three, years, traveling, across, europe, he, toured, science, headquarters, throughout, the, continent, including, in, berlin, and, paris, in, germany, rsted, met, johann, wilhelm, ritter, a, physicist, who, believed, there, was, a, connection, between, electricity, and, magnetism, this, idea, made, sense, to, rsted, as, he, subscribed, to, kantian, thought, regarding, the, unity, of, nature, rsted, s, conversations, with, ritter, drew, him, into, the, study, of, physics, he, became, a, professor, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, in, 1806, and, continued, research, on, electric, currents, and, acoustics, under, his, guidance, the, university, developed, a, comprehensive, physics, and, chemistry, program, and, established, new, laboratories, rsted, welcomed, william, christopher, zeise, to, his, family, home, in, autumn, 1806, he, granted, zeise, a, position, as, his, lecturing, assistant, and, took, the, young, chemist, under, his, tutelage, in, 1812, rsted, again, visited, germany, and, france, after, publishing, videnskaben, om, naturens, almindelige, love, and, f, rste, indledning, til, den, almindelige, naturl, re, 1811, rsted, was, the, first, modern, thinker, to, explicitly, describe, and, name, the, thought, experiment, he, used, the, latin, german, term, gedankenexperiment, circa, 1812, and, the, german, term, gedankenversuch, in, 1820, in, 1819, rsted, was, the, first, to, extract, piperine, and, subsequently, name, it, he, extracted, it, from, piper, nigrum, the, plant, from, which, both, white, and, black, pepper, comes, from, rsted, designed, a, new, type, of, piezometer, to, measure, the, compressibility, of, liquids, in, 1822, in, 1820, rsted, published, his, discovery, that, a, compass, needle, was, deflected, from, magnetic, north, by, a, nearby, electric, current, confirming, a, direct, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, 274, the, often, reported, story, that, rsted, made, this, discovery, incidentally, during, a, lecture, is, a, myth, he, had, in, fact, been, looking, for, a, connection, between, electricity, and, magnetism, since, 1818, but, was, quite, confused, by, the, results, he, was, obtaining, 273, his, initial, interpretation, was, that, magnetic, effects, radiate, from, all, sides, of, a, wire, carrying, an, electric, current, as, do, light, and, heat, three, months, later, he, began, more, intensive, investigations, and, soon, thereafter, published, his, findings, showing, that, an, electric, current, produces, a, circular, magnetic, field, as, it, flows, through, a, wire, for, his, discovery, the, royal, society, of, london, awarded, rsted, the, copley, medal, in, 1820, and, the, french, academy, granted, him, 3, 000, francs, rsted, s, findings, stirred, much, research, into, electrodynamics, throughout, the, scientific, community, influencing, french, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, s, developments, of, a, single, mathematical, formula, to, represent, the, magnetic, forces, between, current, carrying, conductors, rsted, s, work, also, represented, a, major, step, toward, a, unified, concept, of, energy, the, rsted, effect, brought, about, a, communications, revolution, due, to, its, application, to, the, electric, telegraph, the, possibility, of, such, a, telegraph, was, suggested, almost, immediately, by, mathematician, pierre, simon, laplace, and, amp, re, presented, a, paper, based, on, laplace, s, idea, the, same, year, as, rsted, s, discovery, 302, 303, however, it, was, almost, two, decades, before, it, became, a, commercial, reality, rsted, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, march, 1821, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, of, london, in, april, 1821, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1822, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1829, and, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1849, he, founded, the, selskabet, for, naturl, rens, udbredelse, society, for, the, dissemination, of, natural, science, snu, in, 1824, he, was, also, the, founder, of, predecessor, organizations, which, eventually, became, the, danish, meteorological, institute, and, the, danish, patent, and, trademark, office, in, 1829, rsted, founded, den, polytekniske, l, reanstalt, college, of, advanced, technology, which, was, later, renamed, the, technical, university, of, denmark, dtu, in, 1824, rsted, made, a, significant, contribution, to, chemistry, by, being, the, first, person, to, successfully, produce, aluminium, in, its, metallic, state, albeit, in, a, less, than, pure, form, in, 1808, humphry, davy, had, predicted, the, existence, of, the, metal, which, he, gave, the, name, of, alumium, however, his, attempts, to, isolate, it, using, electrolysis, processes, were, unsuccessful, the, closest, he, came, was, an, aluminium, iron, alloy, rsted, succeeded, in, isolating, the, metallic, form, by, reacting, aluminium, chloride, with, potassium, amalgam, an, alloy, of, potassium, and, mercury, and, then, boiling, away, the, mercury, which, left, small, chunks, of, metal, that, he, described, as, appearing, similar, to, tin, he, presented, his, results, and, a, sample, of, the, metal, at, meetings, of, the, danish, academy, of, sciences, in, early, 1825, but, otherwise, appears, to, have, considered, his, discovery, to, be, of, limited, importance, this, ambivalence, coupled, with, the, limited, audience, for, the, danish, academy, s, journal, in, which, the, results, had, been, published, meant, that, the, discovery, went, mostly, unnoticed, by, the, wider, scientific, community, at, the, time, busy, with, other, work, in, 1827, rsted, gave, his, friend, the, german, chemist, friedrich, w, hler, permission, to, take, over, the, research, w, hler, was, able, to, produce, approximately, 30, grams, 1, 1, oz, of, aluminium, powder, soon, thereafter, using, a, process, of, his, own, design, before, finally, in, 1845, isolating, a, quantity, of, solid, metal, sufficient, for, him, to, describe, some, of, its, physical, properties, rsted, died, in, copenhagen, in, 1851, aged, 73, and, was, buried, in, the, assistens, cemetery, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, cgs, unit, of, magnetic, induction, oersted, is, named, for, his, contributions, to, the, field, of, electromagnetism, the, company, danish, oil, and, natural, gas, dong, was, renamed, rsted, to, signal, its, transition, from, fossil, fuels, to, becoming, one, the, world, s, leading, developers, and, operators, of, offshore, windfarms, the, first, danish, satellite, launched, in, 1999, was, named, after, rsted, the, rsted, park, in, copenhagen, was, named, after, rsted, and, his, brother, in, 1879, the, streets, h, c, rsteds, vej, in, frederiksberg, and, h, c, rsteds, all, in, galten, are, also, named, after, him, the, buildings, that, are, home, to, the, department, of, chemistry, and, the, institute, for, mathematical, sciences, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, s, north, campus, are, named, the, h, c, rsted, institute, after, him, a, dormitory, named, h, c, rsted, kollegiet, is, located, in, odense, a, statue, of, hans, christian, rsted, was, installed, in, the, rsted, park, in, 1880, a, commemorative, plaque, is, located, above, the, gate, on, the, building, in, studiestr, de, where, he, lived, and, worked, in, 1885, a, statue, of, rsted, was, installed, in, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, rsted, s, likeness, has, appeared, twice, on, danish, banknotes, for, the, first, time, on, 500, kroner, notes, issued, in, 1875, and, for, the, second, time, on, 100, kroner, notes, issued, between, 1962, and, 1974, two, medals, are, awarded, in, rsted, s, name, the, h, c, rsted, medal, for, danish, scientists, awarded, by, the, danish, society, for, the, dissemination, of, natural, science, snu, as, founded, by, rsted, and, the, oersted, medal, for, notable, contributions, in, the, teaching, of, physics, in, america, awarded, by, american, association, of, physics, teachers, the, technical, university, of, denmark, hosts, the, h, c, rsted, lecture, series, for, prominent, and, engaging, researchers, from, around, the, world, rsted, was, a, published, poet, as, well, as, scientist, his, poetry, series, luftskibet, the, airship, was, inspired, by, the, balloon, flights, of, fellow, physicist, and, stage, magician, tienne, gaspard, robert, in, 1850, shortly, before, his, death, he, submitted, for, publication, a, two, volume, collection, of, philosophical, articles, in, german, under, the, title, der, geist, in, der, natur, the, soul, in, nature, it, was, translated, into, english, and, published, in, one, volume, in, 1852, the, year, after, his, death, other, works, a, significant, number, of, rsted, s, papers, were, made, available, in, english, for, the, first, time, in, a, compilation, published, in, 1998
