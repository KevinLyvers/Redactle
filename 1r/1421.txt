role, as, the, jewish, woman, who, got, the, money, which, made, the, state, possible, would, go, down, in, history, however, upon, returning, home, she, suffered, a, political, setback, the, jewish, agency, and, national, council, executives, excluded, her, from, the, 13, member, cabinet, of, the, provisional, government, of, israel, and, included, her, instead, in, the, 37, member, people, s, council, ben, gurion, protested, this, saying, it, is, inconceivable, that, there, shall, be, no, adequate, woman, it, is, a, moral, and, political, necessity, for, the, yishuv, the, jewish, world, and, the, arab, world, at, one, point, he, even, considered, offering, her, his, spot, on, the, cabinet, on, 13, april, she, was, hospitalized, in, tel, aviv, due, to, a, suspected, heart, attack, ben, gurion, and, the, political, department, heads, urged, her, to, guard, her, health, and, come, to, jerusalem, as, soon, as, she, could, they, asked, her, to, be, the, mother, of, this, city, and, that, her, words, to, 100, 000, residents, will, be, a, source, of, blessing, and, encouragement, however, she, felt, it, was, a, secondary, and, temporary, role, instead, on, 6, may, she, visited, haifa, after, its, 22, april, occupation, by, hagannah, this, trip, had, a, significant, impact, on, her, there, she, witnessed, an, elderly, arab, woman, emerging, from, a, destroyed, house,

kissinger, s, peace, proposal, based, on, security, versus, sovereignty, israel, would, accept, egyptian, sovereignty, over, all, sinai, while, egypt, would, accept, israeli, presence, in, some, of, sinai, s, strategic, positions, in, june, 1969, on, the, two, year, anniversary, of, the, six, day, war, meir, stated, in, an, interview, that, there, was, no, such, thing, as, palestinians, a, comment, later, described, by, al, jazeera, as, one, of, her, defining, and, most, damning, legacies, this, phrase, is, considered, to, be, the, most, famous, example, of, israeli, denial, of, palestinian, identity, the, interview, entitled, who, can, blame, israel, was, published, in, the, sunday, times, on, june, 15, 1969, and, included, the, following, exchange, in, the, wake, of, the, munich, massacre, at, the, 1972, summer, olympics, meir, appealed, to, the, world, to, save, our, citizens, and, condemn, the, unspeakable, criminal, acts, committed, outraged, at, the, perceived, lack, of, global, action, she, ordered, the, mossad, to, hunt, down, and, assassinate, suspected, leaders, and, operatives, of, black, september, and, the, pflp, during, the, 1970s, about, 200, 000, soviet, jewish, emigrants, were, allowed, to, leave, the, soviet, union, for, israel, by, way, of, austria, when, seven, of, these, emigrants, were, taken, hostage, at, the, austria, czechoslovakia, border, by, palestinian, militants, in, september, 1973, the, chancellor, of, austria, bruno, kreisky, closed, the, jewish, agency, s, transit, facility, in, sch, nau, austria, a, few, days, later, in, vienna, meir, tried, to, convince, kreisky, to, reopen, the, facility, by, appealing, to, his, own, jewish, origin, and, described, his, position, as, succumbing, to, terrorist, blackmail, kreisky, did, not, change, his, position, so, meir, returned, to, israel, infuriated, a, few, months, later, austria, opened, a, new, transition, camp, a, common, criticism, of, meir, is, that, she, could, have, avoided, the, yom, kippur, war, in, 1973, for, months, preceding, the, attack, egyptian, president, anwar, sadat, made, repeated, overtures, for, peace, in, exchange, for, a, full, israeli, withdrawal, from, the, sinai, but, these, gestures, were, rebuffed, by, meir, who, had, offered, previously, to, discuss, ceding, most, of, the, sinai, but, was, not, willing, to, restore, the, pre, 1967, borders, and, egypt, had, no, interest, in, peace, talks, under, meir, s, conditions, as, the, nation, s, leader, during, this, short, war, her, main, goal, was, deciding, on, the, timing, of, preliminary, operations, and, providing, the, idf, with, the, necessary, time, and, munitions, to, pull, off, a, victory, in, the, days, leading, up, to, the, yom, kippur, war, israeli, intelligence, could, not, conclusively, determine, that, an, attack, was, imminent, however, on, 5, october, 1973, meir, received, information, that, syrian, forces, were, massing, on, the, golan, heights, she, was, alarmed, by, the, reports, and, believed, that, the, situation, was, similar, to, what, preceded, the, six, day, war, however, her, advisers, counseled, her, not, to, worry, saying, they, would, have, adequate, notice, before, any, war, broke, out, this, made, sense, at, the, time, after, the, six, day, war, most, in, the, israeli, intelligence, community, considered, the, arabs, unprepared, to, launch, another, attack, consequently, although, the, knesset, passed, a, resolution, granting, her, power, to, demand, a, full, scale, call, up, of, the, military, instead, of, the, typical, cabinet, decision, meir, did, not, mobilize, israel, s, forces, early, soon, though, the, threat, of, war, became, very, clear, six, hours, before, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, meir, met, with, minister, of, defense, moshe, dayan, and, general, david, elazar, while, dayan, continued, to, argue, that, war, was, unlikely, and, favored, calling, up, the, air, force, and, only, two, divisions, elazar, advocated, full, scale, army, mobilization, and, the, launch, of, a, full, scale, preemptive, strike, on, syrian, forces, on, october, 6, meir, approved, full, scale, mobilizing, but, rejected, a, preemptive, strike, citing, concerns, that, israel, might, be, perceived, as, initiating, hostilities, which, would, hurt, israel, s, access, to, crucial, foreign, aid, and, military, support, in, particular, from, the, united, states, in, the, resulting, conflict, she, made, it, a, priority, to, inform, washington, of, her, decision, u, s, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, later, confirmed, meir, s, assessment, by, stating, that, if, israel, had, launched, a, preemptive, strike, israel, would, not, have, received, the, backing, of, the, united, states, following, the, yom, kippur, war, meir, s, government, was, plagued, by, infighting, and, questions, over, israel, s, lack, of, preparation, for, the, war, the, agranat, commission, appointed, to, investigate, the, war, cleared, meir, of, direct, responsibility, it, said, about, her, actions, on, yom, kippur, morning, she, decided, wisely, with, common, sense, and, speedily, in, favour, of, the, full, mobilization, of, the, reserves, as, recommended, by, the, chief, of, staff, despite, weighty, political, considerations, thereby, performing, a, most, important, service, for, the, defence, of, the, state, her, party, won, the, elections, in, december, 1973, but, the, coalition, lost, seats, and, was, unable, to, form, a, majority, meir, resigned, as, prime, minister, on, 11, april, 1974, and, gave, up, her, knesset, seat, on, 7, june, 1974, she, never, held, office, again, she, believed, that, was, the, will, of, the, people, and, that, she, had, served, enough, time, as, premier, she, believed, the, government, needed, to, form, a, coalition, she, said, five, years, are, sufficient, it, is, beyond, my, strength, to, continue, carrying, this, burden, yitzhak, rabin, succeeded, her, on, june, 3, 1974, in, 1975, meir, published, her, autobiography, my, life, which, became, a, new, york, times, best, seller, on, 21, november, 1977, meir, spoke, at, the, knesset, on, behalf, of, the, labor, party, to, egyptian, president, anwar, sadat, during, his, historic, trip, as, the, first, arab, leader, to, visit, israel, she, said, his, visit, was, important, for, the, sake, of, the, next, generations, avoiding, war, praised, sadat, for, his, courage, and, vision, and, expressed, the, hope, that, while, many, differences, remained, to, be, resolved, that, vision, would, be, achieved, in, a, spirit, of, mutual, understanding, on, 8, december, 1978, meir, died, of, lymphatic, cancer, lymphoma, in, jerusalem, at, the, age, of, 80, she, was, buried, on, mount,
