state, opera, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, conductors, of, the, 20th, century, he, was, a, controversial, but, dominant, figure, in, european, classical, music, from, the, mid, 1950s, until, his, death, part, of, the, reason, for, this, was, the, large, number, of, recordings, he, made, and, their, prominence, during, his, lifetime, by, one, estimate, he, was, the, top, selling, classical, music, recording, artist, of, all, time, having, sold, an, estimated, 200, million, records, the, karajans, were, of, greek, ancestry, herbert, s, great, great, grandfather, georg, karajan, ge, rgios, karaj, nnis, greek, was, born, in, kozani, in, the, ottoman, province, of, rumelia, now, in, greece, leaving, for, vienna, in, 1767, and, eventually, chemnitz, electorate, of, saxony, georg, and, his, brother, participated, in, the, establishment, of, saxony, s, cloth, industry, and, both, were, ennobled, for, their, services, by, frederick, augustus, iii, on, 1, june, 1792, thus, adding, the, prefix, von, to, the, family, name, this, usage, disappeared, with, the, abolition, of, austrian, nobility, after, world, war, i, the, surname, karaj, nnis, became, karajan, although, traditional, biographers, ascribed, a, slovak, and, serbian, or, simply, a, slavic, origin, to, his, mother, karajan, s, family, from, the, maternal, side, through, his, grandfather, who, was, born, in, the, village, of, mojstrana, duchy, of, carniola, today, in, slovenia, was, slovene, aromanian, heritage, has, also, been, claimed, through, the, slovene, line, karajan, was, related, to, the, slovenian, austrian, composer, hugo, wolf, he, also, seems, to, have, known, some, slovene, herbert, ritter, von, karajan, was, born, in, salzburg, austria, hungary, the, second, son, of, physician, surgeon, and, senior, consultant, ernst, von, karajan, 1868, 1951, and, marta, n, e, martha, kosma, 1881, 1954, married, 1905, he, was, a, child, prodigy, at, the, piano, from, 1916, to, 1926, he, studied, at, the, mozarteum, in, salzburg, with, franz, ledwinka, piano, franz, zauer, harmony, and, bernhard, paumgartner, composition, and, chamber, music, he, was, encouraged, to, concentrate, on, conducting, by, paumgartner, who, detected, his, exceptional, promise, in, that, regard, in, 1926, karajan, graduated, from, the, conservatory, and, continued, his, studies, at, the, vienna, academy, studying, piano, with, josef, hofmann, a, teacher, with, the, same, name, as, the, pianist, and, conducting, with, alexander, wunderer, and, franz, schalk, karajan, made, his, debut, as, a, conductor, in, salzburg, on, 22, january, 1929, the, performance, got, the, attention, of, the, general, manager, of, the, stadttheater, in, ulm, and, led, to, karajan, s, first, appointment, as, assistant, kapellmeister, of, the, theater, his, senior, colleague, in, ulm, was, otto, schulmann, after, schulmann, was, forced, to, leave, germany, in, 1933, with, the, nsdap, takeover, karajan, was, promoted, to, first, kapellmeister, in, the, postwar, era, karajan, maintained, silence, about, his, nazi, party, membership, which, gave, rise, to, a, number, of, conflicting, stories, about, it, one, version, is, that, because, of, the, changing, political, climate, and, the, destabilization, of, his, position, karajan, attempted, to, join, the, nazi, party, in, salzburg, in, april, 1933, but, his, membership, was, later, declared, invalid, because, he, somehow, failed, to, follow, up, on, the, application, and, that, karajan, formally, joined, the, nazi, party, in, aachen, in, 1935, implying, that, he, was, not, eager, to, pursue, membership, more, recent, scholarship, clears, up, this, confusion, the, truth, is, that, karajan, actually, joined, the, nazi, party, twice, the, first, time, this, happened, was, on, 8, april, 1933, in, salzburg, he, paid, the, admission, fee, received, the, membership, number, 1607525, and, moved, to, ulm, it, is, said, that, this, accession, was, never, formally, carried, out, it, is, also, certain, that, karajan, rejoined, the, nazi, party, in, aachen, in, march, 1935, this, time, receiving, the, membership, number, 3430914, after, the, annexation, of, austria, the, responsible, reich, treasurer, of, the, nazi, party, discovered, karajan, s, double, membership, in, munich, and, declared, the, first, accession, invalid, the, second, was, made, retroactive, to, 1, may, 1933, during, the, entire, nazi, era, he, never, hesitated, to, open, his, concerts, with, the, nazi, favorite, horst, wessel, lied, 27, but, always, maintained, he, joined, strictly, for, career, reasons, his, enemies, called, him, ss, colonel, von, karajan, 13, 14, in, 1933, karajan, made, his, conducting, debut, at, the, salzburg, festival, with, the, walpurgisnacht, scene, in, max, reinhardt, s, production, of, faust, in, salzburg, in, 1934, karajan, led, the, vienna, philharmonic, for, the, first, time, and, from, 1934, to, 1941, he, was, engaged, to, conduct, operatic, and, orchestra, concerts, at, the, theater, aachen, karajan, s, career, received, a, significant, boost, in, 1935, when, he, became, germany, s, youngest, generalmusikdirektor, at, aachen, and, performed, as, a, guest, conductor, in, bucharest, brussels, stockholm, amsterdam, and, paris, in, 1938, karajan, made, his, debut, with, the, berlin, philharmonic, the, same, year, he, made, his, debut, with, the, berlin, state, opera, conducting, fidelio, and, then, had, a, major, success, at, the, state, opera, with, tristan, und, isolde, his, performance, was, hailed, by, a, berlin, critic, as, das, wunder, karajan, karajan, the, miracle, the, critic, wrote, that, karajan, s, success, with, wagner, s, demanding, work, tristan, und, isolde, sets, himself, alongside, wilhelm, furtw, ngler, and, victor, de, sabata, the, greatest, opera, conductors, in, germany, at, the, present, time, receiving, a, contract, with, deutsche, grammophon, that, same, year, karajan, made, the, first, of, numerous, recordings, conducting, the, staatskapelle, berlin, in, the, overture, to, the, magic, flute, karajan, s, career, continued, to, thrive, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, in, 1939, the, berlin, state, opera, appointed, him, state, kapellmeister, and, conductor, of, concerts, by, the, prussian, state, orchestra, he, then, became, music, director, of, the, staatskapelle, berlin, with, which, he, toured, rome, with, extraordinary, success, the, next, year, his, contract, in, aachen, was, discontinued, his, marriage, to, anita, g, termann, with, one, jewish, grandparent, and, the, prosecution, of, his, agent, rudolf, vedder, also, contributed, to, his, temporary, professional, decline, leaving, him, few, engagements, beyond, a, limited, season, of, concerts, with, the, staatskapelle, by, 1944, karajan, was, by, his, account, losing, favour, with, the, nazi, leadership, but, he, conducted, concerts, in, berlin, as, late, as, 18, february, 1945, a, short, time, later, in, the, closing, stages, of, the, war, he, and, his, wife, fled, germany, for, milan, relocating, with, the, assistance, of, victor, de, sabata, karajan, s, increased, prominence, from, 1933, to, 1945, has, led, to, speculation, that, he, joined, the, nazi, party, solely, to, advance, his, career, critics, such, as, jim, svejda, have, pointed, out, that, other, prominent, conductors, such, as, arturo, toscanini, otto, klemperer, erich, kleiber, and, fritz, busch, fled, germany, or, italy, at, the, time, richard, osborne, noted, that, among, the, many, significant, conductors, who, continued, to, work, in, germany, during, the, war, years, wilhelm, furtw, ngler, carl, schuricht, karl, b, hm, hans, knappertsbusch, clemens, krauss, and, karl, elmendorff, karajan, was, one, of, the, youngest, and, thus, one, of, the, least, advanced, in, his, career, he, was, allowed, to, conduct, various, orchestras, and, was, free, to, travel, even, to, the, netherlands, to, conduct, the, concertgebouw, orchestra, and, make, recordings, there, in, 1943, he, conducted, for, an, audience, of, 300, nazi, armaments, officials, at, a, conference,

karajan, did, not, attend, her, funeral, in, aachen, on, 22, october, 1942, at, the, height, of, the, second, world, war, karajan, married, his, second, wife, anna, maria, anita, sauest, born, g,

growing, up, in, provence, before, being, discovered, by, christian, dior, when, she, was, 18, this, laid, the, foundation, for, an, international, modelling, career, karajan, first, met, mouret, in, 1957, and, was, deeply, taken, with, her, their, first, daughter, isabel, was, born, on, 25, june, 1960, in, 1964, their, second, daughter, arabel, was, born, after, karajan, s, death, eliette, continued, his, musical, legacy, by, founding, of, the, herbert, von, karajan, centre, in, vienna, now, in, salzburg, and, known, as, the, eliette, and, herbert, von, karajan, institute, her, numerous, projects, focus, particularly, on, the, development, of, young, people, and, she, is, a, patron, of, the, salzburg, easter, festival, karajan, had, been, a, passionate, sportsman, since, he, was, a, teenager, he, was, a, keen, skier, and, swimmer, and, followed, a, daily, yoga, ritual, he, won, several, regattas, aboard, his, racing, yacht, christened, helisara, he, piloted, his, learjet, and, was, a, great, sailing, and, car, enthusiast, particularly, fond, of, porsches, he, ordered, a, specially, configured, type, 930, with, martini, rossi, livery, and, his, name, on, the, back, of, the, porsche, 911, turbo, one, of, karajan, s, signature, skills, as, a, conductor, was, his, ability, to, extract, exquisite, sounds, from, orchestras, his, biographer, roger, vaughan, observed, this, phenomenon, while, listening, to, the, berlin, philharmonic, play, in, 1986, after, nearly, 30, years, under, karajan, s, direction, noting, that, what, rivets, one, s, attention, is, the, beauty, and, perfection, of, the, sounds, the, softest, of, pianissimos, commands, rapt, attention, the, smooth, crescendos, peak, exactly, when, they, should, the, breaks, are, sliced, clean, without, the, slightest, ragged, edge, perhaps, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, karajan, s, conducting, style, was, his, propensity, to, conduct, with, his, eyes, closed, this, is, highly, unusual, for, a, conductor, as, eye, contact, is, generally, regarded, as, of, paramount, importance, to, the, conductor, s, communication, with, the, orchestra, yet, as, vaughan, remarked, ere, is, one, of, the, fascinating, aspects, of, conducting, there, are, no, rules, only, guidelines, the, most, eccentric, approach, is, tolerated, if, the, results, are, successful, indeed, james, galway, who, served, as, principal, flutist, of, the, berlin, philharmonic, from, 1969, to, 1975, recalled, that, he, achieved, most, of, what, he, wanted, through, charm, but, there, were, reasons, for, many, of, karajan, s, eccentricities, conducting, with, his, eyes, closed, for, instance, was, a, consequence, of, memorizing, scores, keeping, his, eyes, closed, helped, him, keep, focus, karajan, s, method, of, score, study, too, was, somewhat, unusual, as, noted, by, his, friend, walter, legge, who, remarked, he, is, one, of, the, few, conductors, i, have, known, who, has, never, made, a, mark, in, a, score, he, will, absorb, a, score, quietly, sitting, on, the, floor, like, a, relaxed, siamese, cat, over, the, years, he, has, learned, how, completely, to, relax, the, body, so, the, mind, is, absolutely, free, to, do, what, it, wants, karajan, was, also, known, for, his, preternaturally, keen, sense, of, tempo, even, going, so, far, as, to, have, himself, tested, against, a, computer, to, prove, it, he, insisted, that, this, skill, was, learned, not, inherited, and, considered, it, the, bedrock, of, musical, interpretations, in, fact, he, cited, inconsistencies, in, rhythmic, accuracy, and, control, as, one, thing, that, might, make, me, lose, my, temper, i, can, accept, a, wrong, note, from, an, orchestra, but, when, everything, is, getting, faster, or, slower, that, i, cannot, accept, he, once, explained, to, a, german, journalist, why, he, preferred, the, berlin, to, the, vienna, philharmonic, if, i, tell, the, berliners, to, step, forward, they, do, it, if, i, tell, the, viennese, to, step, forward, they, do, it, but, then, they, ask, why, karajan, was, a, noted, interpreter, of, virtually, every, standard, of, the, classical, repertoire, from, the, baroque, era, to, the, 20th, century, he, was, an, admirer, of, glenn, gould, s, interpretations, of, bach, performing, the, d, minor, keyboard, concerto, with, him, on, one, occasion, the, eminent, haydn, scholar, h, c, robbins, landon, considered, karajan, s, recordings, of, the, 12, london, symphonies, as, some, of, the, finest, he, knew, and, his, multiple, beethoven, cycles, are, still, staples, yet, karajan, s, real, interests, seem, to, have, lain, in, the, period, from, the, late, 19th, to, the, mid, 20th, centuries, principal, among, these, were, his, fascinations, with, the, composers, anton, bruckner, and, jean, sibelius, in, a, 1981, interview, with, gramophone, s, robert, layton, karajan, remarked, that, he, felt, a, much, deeper, influence, affinity, kinship, call, it, what, you, like, with, bruckner, there, is, this, sense, of, the, urwald, the, primaeval, forest, the, feeling, of, elemental, power, that, one, is, dealing, with, something, profound, when, pressed, about, this, connection, toward, the, end, of, his, life, by, his, biographer, osborne, karajan, echoed, some, of, these, sentiments, saying, there, is, in, both, a, sense, of, the, elemental, but, i, have, often, asked, myself, what, it, is, that, drew, me, to, sibelius, s, music, and, i, think, it, is, that, he, is, a, composer, who, cannot, really, be, compared, to, anyone, else, and, you, never, come, to, an, end, with, him, i, think, it, is, perhaps, also, to, do, with, my, love, of, remote, places, my, love, of, mountains, rather, than, cities, layton, demystifies, this, relationship, somewhat, by, observing, that, tring, tremolandi, and, pedal, points, are, of, course, among, and, we, hear, brucknerian, echoes, in, the, development, section, of, the, first, movement, of, kullervo, written, only, a, year, or, so, after, sibelius, first, heard, bruckner, s, third, symphony, in, vienna, yet, the, most, potent, assessment, of, karajan, s, interpretation, of, sibelius, s, music, came, from, sibelius, himself, who, according, to, legge, said, karajan, is, the, only, conductor, who, plays, what, i, meant, karajan, was, also, a, prolific, opera, conductor, championing, the, works, of, wagner, verdi, richard, strauss, and, puccini, verdi, s, last, opera, falstaff, was, something, of, a, mainstay, throughout, karajan, s, career, in, his, conversations, with, osborne, karajan, recalled, that, in, the, 1930s, when, italian, opera, was, still, something, of, a, rarity, in, austria, and, germany, y, training, in, verdi, s, falstaff, came, from, toscanini, there, wasn, t, a, rehearsal, in, either, vienna, or, salzburg, at, which, i, wasn, t, present, i, think, i, heard, about, thirty, from, toscanini, i, learnt, the, phrasing, and, the, words, always, with, italian, singers, which, was, unheard, of, in, germany, then, i, don, t, think, i, ever, opened, the, score, it, was, so, in, my, ears, i, just, knew, it, karajan, went, on, to, make, two, recordings, of, falstaff, one, for, emi, hmv, in, 1956, and, another, for, philips, in, 1980, and, his, colleague, otto, klemperer, hailed, the, vienna, state, opera, production, as, really, excellent, strauss, was, likewise, a, continual, force, in, karajan, s, life, not, just, as, a, composer, but, as, a, conductor, karajan, recounted, their, only, proper, meeting, in, 1939, to, osborne, t, the, end, he, came, and, said, to, me, it, was, the, best, performance, of, the, opera, he, had, ever, heard, i, said, i, don, t, really, want, to, hear, this, tell, me, what, was, wrong, with, it, i, think, he, was, surprised, by, my, reaction, so, he, asked, me, to, lunch, the, next, day, he, said, you, have, made, the, music, very, clear, the, fp, here, the, accent, there, but, these, are, not, at, all, important, just, wave, your, stick, around, a, bit, he, made, a, gesture, like, stirring, a, pudding, but, what, he, meant, was, let, the, music, flow, more, naturally, karajan, conducted, and, recorded, prolifically, mainly, with, the, berlin, philharmonic, and, the, vienna, philharmonic, he, conducted, other, orchestras, including, the, nhk, symphony, orchestra, the, new, york, philharmonic, the, concertgebouw, orchestra, the, orchestre, de, paris, the, orchestra, of, teatro, alla, scala, milan, and, the, staatskapelle, dresden, but, the, vast, majority, of, his, recordings, were, made, with, the, berlin, and, vienna, orchestras, he, also, left, a, considerable, legacy, of, recordings, with, the, philharmonia, orchestra, his, last, performance, being, in, 1960, although, he, made, recordings, with, several, labels, notably, emi, it, is, deutsche, grammophon, with, which, he, became, most, associated, making, 330, recordings, with, it, karajan, s, 1981, deutsche, grammophon, recording, of, an, alpine, symphony, with, the, berlin, philharmonic, became, the, first, work, ever, to, be, pressed, on, the, compact, disc, format, even, though, his, repertoire, had, been, extensively, covered, in, analog, lp, record, he, spent, the, rest, of, the, 1980s, making, digital, recordings, notably, rerecording, beethoven, s, symphonies, karajan, and, the, berlin, philharmonic, s, 1977, analog, recording, of, beethoven, s, symphony, no, 3, won, the, grand, prix, du, disque, while, their, 1984, digital, recording, of, it, was, not, particularly, critically, acclaimed, yet, sold, considerably, more, in, the, mid, 1990s, deutsche, grammophon, released, the, karajan, gold, series, remixes, of, karajan, s, 1980s, digital, recordings, enhanced, by, 24, bit, processing, karajan, filmed, performances, of, his, work, for, both, unitel, and, his, own, company, telemondial, the, so, called, karajan, sound, remains, something, of, a, litmus, test, for, critics, dividing, them, into, two, competing, camps, two, reviews, from, the, penguin, guide, to, compact, discs, illustrate, this, point, the, new, york, times, writer, john, rockwell, wrote, in, 1989, he, had, a, particular, gift, for, wagner, and, above, all, for, bruckner, whose, music, he, conducted, with, sovereign, command, and, elevated, feeling, karajan, s, concerts, came, to, be, considered, major, cultural, events, in, a, 1982, tour, of, the, united, states, musical, stars, from, zubin, mehta, and, seiji, ozawa, to, frank, sinatra, attended, his, carnegie, hall, concerts,
