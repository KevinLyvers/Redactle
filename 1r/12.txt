version, of, the, opening, of, the, american, western, frontier, the, film, was, an, even, greater, box, office, hit, than, its, predecessor, due, in, large, part, to, jean, arthur, s, definitive,

guess, it, boils, down, to, this, you, find, out, what, people, expect, of, your, type, of, character, and, then, you, give, them, what, they, want, that, way, an, actor, never, seems, unnatural, or, affected, no, matter, what, role, he, plays, cooper, s, acting, style, consisted, of, three, essential, characteristics, his, ability, to, project, elements, of, his, own, personality, onto, the, characters, he, portrayed, to, appear, natural, and, authentic, in, his, roles, and, to, underplay, and, deliver, restrained, performances, calibrated, for, the, camera, and, the, screen, acting, teacher, lee, strasberg, once, observed, the, simplest, examples, of, stanislavsky, s, ideas, are, actors, such, as, gary, cooper, john, wayne, and, spencer, tracy, they, try, not, to, act, but, to, be, themselves, to, respond, or, react, they, refuse, to, say, or, do, anything, they, feel, not, to, be, consonant, with, their, own, characters, film, director, fran, ois, truffaut, ranked, cooper, among, the, greatest, actors, because, of, his, ability, to, deliver, great, performances, without, direction, this, ability, to, project, elements, of, his, own, personality, onto, his, characters, produced, a, continuity, across, his, performances, to, the, extent, that, critics, and, audiences, were, convinced, he, was, simply, playing, himself, cooper, s, ability, to, project, his, personality, onto, his, characters, played, an, important, part, in, his, appearing, natural, and, authentic, on, screen, actor, john, barrymore, said, of, cooper, this, fellow, is, the, world, s, greatest, actor, he, does, without, effort, what, the, rest, of, us, spend, our, lives, trying, to, learn, namely, to, be, natural, charles, laughton, who, played, opposite, cooper, in, devil, and, the, deep, agreed, in, truth, that, boy, hasn, t, the, least, idea, how, well, he, acts, he, gets, at, it, from, the, inside, from, his, own, clear, way, of, looking, at, life, william, wyler, who, directed, cooper, in, two, films, called, him, a, superb, actor, a, master, of, movie, acting, in, his, review, of, cooper, s, performance, in, the, real, glory, graham, greene, wrote, sometimes, his, lean, photogenic, face, seems, to, leave, everything, to, the, lens, but, there, is, no, question, here, of, his, not, acting, watch, him, inoculate, the, girl, against, cholera, the, casual, jab, of, the, needle, and, the, dressing, slapped, on, while, he, talks, as, though, a, thousand, arms, had, taught, him, where, to, stab, and, he, doesn, t, have, to, think, anymore, cooper, s, style, of, underplaying, before, the, camera, surprised, many, of, his, directors, and, fellow, actors, even, in, his, earliest, feature, films, he, recognized, the, camera, s, ability, to, pick, up, slight, gestures, and, facial, movements, commenting, on, cooper, s, performance, in, sergeant, york, director, howard, hawks, observed, he, worked, very, hard, and, yet, he, didn, t, seem, to, be, working, he, was, a, strange, actor, because, you, d, look, at, him, during, a, scene, and, you, d, think, this, isn, t, going, to, be, any, good, but, when, you, saw, the, rushes, in, the, projection, room, the, next, day, you, could, read, in, his, face, all, the, things, he, d, been, thinking, sam, wood, who, directed, cooper, in, four, films, had, similar, observations, about, cooper, s, performance, in, pride, of, the, yankees, noting, what, i, thought, was, underplaying, turned, out, to, be, just, the, right, approach, on, the, screen, he, s, perfect, yet, on, the, set, you, d, swear, it, s, the, worst, job, of, acting, in, the, history, of, motion, pictures, fellow, actors, admired, his, abilities, as, an, actor, commenting, on, her, two, films, playing, opposite, cooper, actress, ingrid, bergman, concluded, the, personality, of, this, man, was, so, enormous, so, overpowering, and, that, expression, in, his, eyes, and, his, face, it, was, so, delicate, and, so, underplayed, you, just, didn, t, notice, it, until, you, saw, it, on, the, screen, i, thought, he, was, marvelous, the, most, underplaying, and, the, most, natural, actor, i, ever, worked, with, tom, hanks, declared, in, only, one, scene, in, the, first, film, to, win, the, academy, award, for, best, picture, we, see, the, future, of, screen, acting, in, the, form, of, gary, cooper, he, is, quiet, and, natural, somehow, different, from, the, other, cast, members, he, does, something, mysterious, with, his, eyes, and, shoulders, that, is, much, more, like, being, than, acting, daniel, day, lewis,
