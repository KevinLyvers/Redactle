the, idea, of, universal, toleration, she, admits, all, religions, into, her, bosom, she, secures, the, sacred, rights, of, every, individual, and, astonishing, absurdity, to, europeans, she, sees, a, thousand, discordant, opinions, live, in, the, strictest, harmony, it, will, finally, raise, her, to, a, pitch, of, greatness, and, lustre, before, which, the, glory, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, shall, dwindle, to, a, point, and, the, splendor, of, modern, empires, fade, into, obscurity, webster, dedicated, his, speller, and, dictionary, to, providing, an, intellectual, foundation, for, american, nationalism, from, 1787, to, 1789, webster, was, an, outspoken, supporter, of, the, new, constitution, in, october, 1787, he, wrote, a, pamphlet, entitled, an, examination, into, the,

element, of, federalism, he, was, one, of, the, few, americans, who, paid, much, attention, to, french, theorist, jean, jacques, rousseau, he, was, one, of, the, few, americans, to, engage, with, french, theorist, jean, jacques, rousseau, not, for, rousseau, s, politics, but, for, his, pedagogical, ideas, in, emile, 1762, which, influenced, webster, in, adapting, his, speller, to, the, stages, of, a, child, s, development, noah, webster, married, rebecca, greenleaf, 1766, 1847, on, october, 26, 1789, in, new, haven, connecticut, they, had, eight, children, webster, joined, the, elite, in,

leading, federalist, party, newspaper, in, december, he, founded, new, york, s, first, daily, newspaper, american, minerva, later, renamed, the, commercial, advertiser, which, he, edited, for, four, years, writing, the, equivalent, of, 20, volumes, of, articles, and, editorials, he, also, published, the, semi, weekly, publication, the, herald, a, gazette, for, the, country, later, known, as, the, new, york, spectator, as, a, federalist, spokesman, webster, defended, the, administrations, of, george, washington, and, john, adams, especially, their, policy, of, neutrality, between, britain, and, france, and, he, especially, criticized, the, excesses, of, the, french, revolution, and, its, reign, of, terror, when, french, ambassador, citizen, gen, t, set, up, a, network, of, pro, jacobin, democratic, republican, societies, that, entered, american, politics, and, attacked, president, washington, he, condemned, them, he, later, defended, jay, s, treaty, between, the, united, states, and, britain, as, a, result, he, was, repeatedly, denounced, by, the, jeffersonian, republicans, as, a, pusillanimous, half, begotten, self, dubbed, patriot, an, incurable, lunatic, and, a, deceitful, newsmonger, pedagogue, and, quack, for, decades, he, was, one, of, the, most, prolific, authors, in, the, new, nation, publishing, textbooks, political, essays, a, report, on, infectious, diseases, and, newspaper, articles, for, his, federalist, party, in, 1799, webster, wrote, two, massive, volumes, on, the, causes, of, epidemics, and, pestilential, diseases, medical, historians, have, considered, him, as, america, s, first, epidemiologist, he, was, so, prolific, that, a, modern, bibliography, of, his, works, spans, 655, pages, he, moved, back, to, new, haven, in, 1798, and, was, elected, as, a, federalist, to, the, connecticut, house, of, representatives, in, 1800, and, 1802, 1807, webster, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1799, he, moved, to, amherst, massachusetts, in, 1812, where, he, helped, to, found, amherst, college, in, 1822, his, family, moved, back, to, new, haven, where, webster, was, awarded, an, honorary, degree, from, yale, the, following, year, in, 1827, webster, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, as, a, teacher, webster, grew, dissatisfied, with, american, elementary, schools, they, could, be, overcrowded, with, up, to, seventy, children, of, all, ages, crammed, into, one, room, schoolhouses, they, suffered, from, poorly, paid, staff, lacked, desks, and, used, unsatisfactory, textbooks, imported, from, england, webster, thought, that, americans, should, learn, from, american, books, so, he, began, writing, the, three, volume, compendium, a, grammatical, institute, of, the, english, language, the, work, consisted, of, a, speller, published, in, 1783, a, grammar, published, in, 1784, and, a, reader, published, in, 1785, his, aim, was, to, provide, a, uniquely, american, approach, to, education, his, most, important, improvement, he, claimed, was, to, rescue, our, native, tongue, from, the, clamour, of, pedantry, that, surrounded, english, grammar, and, pronunciation, he, complained, that, the, english, language, had, been, corrupted, by, the, british, aristocracy, which, set, its, own, standard, for, proper, spelling, and, pronunciation, webster, rejected, the, notion, that, the, study, of, greek, and, latin, must, precede, the, study, of, english, grammar, the, appropriate, standard, for, the, american, language, argued, webster, was, the, same, republican, principles, as, american, civil, and, ecclesiastical, constitutions, this, meant, that, the, people, at, large, must, control, the, language, popular, sovereignty, in, government, must, be, accompanied, by, popular, usage, in, language, the, speller, was, designed, to, be, easily, taught, to, students, progressing, according, to, age, from, his, own, experiences, as, a, teacher, webster, thought, that, the, speller, should, be, simple, and, gave, an, orderly, presentation, of, words, and, the, rules, of, spelling, and, pronunciation, he, believed, that, students, learned, most, readily, when, he, broke, a, complex, problem, into, its, component, parts, and, had, each, pupil, master, one, part, before, moving, to, the, next, ellis, argues, that, webster, anticipated, some, of, the, insights, currently, associated, with, jean, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, webster, said, that, children, pass, through, distinctive, learning, phases, in, which, they, master, increasingly, complex, or, abstract, tasks, therefore, teachers, must, not, try, to, teach, a, three, year, old, how, to, read, they, could, not, do, it, until, age, five, he, organized, his, speller, accordingly, beginning, with, the, alphabet, and, moving, systematically, through, the, different, sounds, of, vowels, and, consonants, then, syllables, then, simple, words, then, more, complex, words, then, sentences, the, speller, was, originally, titled, the, first, part, of, the, grammatical, institute, of, the, english, language, over, the, course, of, 385, editions, in, his, lifetime, the, title, was, changed, in, 1786, to, the, american, spelling, book, and, again, in, 1829, to, the, elementary, spelling, book, most, people, called, it, the, blue, backed, speller, because, of, its, blue, cover, and, for, the, next, one, hundred, years, webster, s, book, taught, children, how, to, read, spell, and, pronounce, words, it, was, the, most, popular, american, book, of, its, time, by, 1837, it, had, sold, 15, million, copies, and, some, 60, million, by, 1890, reaching, the, majority, of, young, students, in, the, nation, s, first, century, its, royalty, of, a, half, cent, per, copy, was, enough, to, sustain, webster, in, his, other, endeavors, it, also, helped, create, the, popular, contests, known, as, spelling, bees, as, time, went, on, webster, changed, the, spellings, in, the, book, to, more, phonetic, ones, most, of, them, already, existed, as, alternative, spellings, he, chose, spellings, such, as, defense, color, and, traveler, and, changed, the, re, to, er, in, words, such, as, center, he, also, changed, tongue, to, the, older, spelling, tung, but, this, did, not, catch, on, part, three, of, his, grammatical, institute, 1785, was, a, reader, designed, to, uplift, the, mind, and, diffuse, the, principles, of, virtue, and, patriotism, in, the, choice, of, pieces, he, explained, i, have, not, been, inattentive, to, the, political, interests, of, america, several, of, those, masterly, addresses, of, congress, written, at, the, commencement, of, the, late, revolution, contain, such, noble, just, and, independent, sentiments, of, liberty, and, patriotism, that, i, cannot, help, wishing, to, transfuse, them, into, the, breasts, of, the, rising, generation, students, received, the, usual, quota, of, plutarch, shakespeare, swift, and, addison, as, well, as, such, americans, as, joel, barlow, s, vision, of, columbus, timothy, dwight, s, conquest, of, canaan, and, john, trumbull, s, poem, m, fingal, he, included, excerpts, from, tom, paine, s, the, crisis, and, an, essay, by, thomas, day, calling, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, accord, with, the, declaration, of, independence, webster, s, speller, was, deliberately, secular, it, ended, with, two, pages, of, important, dates, in, american, history, beginning, with, columbus, s, discovery, of, america, in, 1492, and, ending, with, the, battle, of, yorktown, in, 1781, there, was, no, mention, of, god, the, bible, or, sacred, events, let, sacred, things, be, appropriated, for, sacred, purposes, webster, wrote, as, ellis, explains, webster, began, to, construct, a, secular, catechism, to, the, nation, state, here, was, the, first, appearance, of, civics, in, american, schoolbooks, in, this, sense, webster, s, speller, becoming, what, was, to, be, the, secular, successor, to, the, new, england, primer, with, its, explicitly, biblical, injunctions, later, in, life, webster, became, more, religious, and, incorporated, religious, themes, into, his, work, however, after, 1840, webster, s, books, lost, market, share, to, the, mcguffey, eclectic, readers, of, william, holmes, mcguffey, which, sold, over, 120, million, copies, vincent, p, bynack, 1984, examines, webster, in, relation, to, his, commitment, to, the, idea, of, a, unified, american, national, culture, that, would, stave, off, the, decline, of, republican, virtues, and, solidarity, webster, acquired, his, perspective, on, language, from, such, theorists, as, maupertuis, michaelis, and, herder, there, he, found, the, belief, that, a, nation, s, linguistic, forms, and, the, thoughts, correlated, with, them, shaped, individuals, behavior, thus, the, etymological, clarification, and, reform, of, american, english, promised, to, improve, citizens, manners, and, thereby, preserve, republican, purity, and, social, stability, this, presupposition, animated, webster, s, speller, and, grammar, in, 1806, webster, published, his, first, dictionary, a, compendious, dictionary, of, the, english, language, by, 1807, he, began, work, on, a, more, extensive, dictionary, an, american, dictionary, of, the, english, language, which, took, twenty, six, years, to, complete, to, evaluate, the, etymology, of, words, webster, learned, twenty, eight, languages, including, old, english, gothic, german, greek, latin, italian, spanish, french, dutch, welsh, russian, hebrew, aramaic, persian, arabic, and, sanskrit, his, goal, was, to, standardize, american, english, which, varied, widely, across, the, country, they, also, spelled, pronounced, and, used, english, words, differently, webster, completed, his, dictionary, during, his, year, abroad, in, january, 1825, in, a, boarding, house, in, cambridge, england, his, book, contained, seventy, thousand, words, of, which, twelve, thousand, had, never, appeared, in, a, published, dictionary, before, as, a, spelling, reformer, webster, preferred, spellings, that, matched, pronunciation, better, in, a, companion, to, the, american, revolution, 2008, john, algeo, notes, it, is, often, assumed, that, characteristically, american, spellings, were, invented, by, noah, webster, he, was, very, influential, in, popularizing, certain, spellings, in, america, but, he, did, not, originate, them, rather, he, chose, already, existing, options, such, as, center, color, and, check, on, such, grounds, as, simplicity, analogy, or, etymology, he, also, added, american, words, like, skunk, that, did, not, appear, in, british, dictionaries, at, the, age, of, seventy, webster, published, his, dictionary, in, 1828, registering, the, copyright, on, april, 14, despite, its, significant, place, in, the, history, of, american, english, webster, s, first, dictionary, sold, only, 2, 500, copies, he, was, forced, to, mortgage, his, home, to, develop, a, second, edition, and, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, had, debt, problems, in, 1840, the, second, edition, was, published, in, two, volumes, on, may, 28, 1843, a, few, days, after, he, had, completed, making, more, specific, definitions, to, the, second, edition, and, with, much, of, his, efforts, with, the, dictionary, still, unrecognized, noah, webster, died, his, last, words, were, i, am, entirely, submissive, to, the, will, of, god, he, died, later, that, evening, the, rights, to, his, dictionary, were, acquired, by, charles, and, george, merriam, in, 1843, from, webster, s, estate, and, all, contemporary, merriam, webster, dictionaries, trace, their, lineage, to, that, of, webster, although, many, others, have, adopted, his, name, attempting, to, share, in, the, popularity, he, is, buried, in, new, haven, s, grove, street, cemetery, lepore, 2008, illustrates, webster, s, paradoxical, views, on, language, and, politics, and, explains, why, his, work, was, initially, poorly, received, culturally, conservative, federalists, denounced, the, work, as, radical, too, inclusive, in, its, lexicon, and, even, bordering, on, vulgar, meanwhile, webster, s, old, foes, the, republicans, attacked, the, man, labeling, him, mad, for, such, an, undertaking, scholars, have, long, seen, webster, s, 1844, dictionary, to, be, an, important, resource, for, reading, poet, emily, dickinson, s, life, and, work, she, once, commented, that, the, lexicon, was, her, only, companion, for, years, one, biographer, said, the, dictionary, was, no, mere, reference, book, to, her, she, read, it, as, a, priest, his, breviary, over, and, over, page, by, page, with, utter, absorption, nathan, austin, has, explored, the, intersection, of, lexicographical, and, poetic, practices, in, american, literature, and, attempts, to, map, out, a, lexical, poetics, using, webster, s, definitions, as, his, base, poets, mined, his, dictionaries, often, drawing, upon, the, lexicography, in, order, to, express, word, play, austin, explicates, key, definitions, from, both, the, compendious, 1806, and, american, 1828, dictionaries, and, finds, a, range, of, themes, such, as, the, politics, of, american, versus, british, english, and, issues, of, national, identity, and, independent, culture, austin, argues, that, webster, s, dictionaries, helped, redefine, americanism, in, an, era, of, highly, flexible, cultural, identity, webster, himself, saw, the, dictionaries, as, a, nationalizing, device, to, separate, america, from, britain, calling, his, project, a, federal, language, with, competing, forces, towards, regularity, on, the, one, hand, and, innovation, on, the, other, austin, suggests, that, the, contradictions, of, webster, s, lexicography, were, part, of, a, larger, play, between, liberty, and, order, within, american, intellectual, discourse, with, some, pulled, toward, europe, and, the, past, and, others, pulled, toward, america, and, the, new, future, in, 1850, blackie, and, son, in, glasgow, published, the, first, general, dictionary, of, english, that, relied, heavily, upon, pictorial, illustrations, integrated, with, the, text, its, the, imperial, dictionary, english, technological, and, scientific, adapted, to, the, present, state, of, literature, science, and, art, on, the, basis, of, webster, s, english, dictionary, used, webster, s, for, most, of, their, text, adding, some, additional, technical, words, that, went, with, illustrations, of, machinery, in, his, early, years, webster, was, a, freethinker, but, in, 1808, he, became, a, convert, to, calvinistic, orthodoxy, and, thereafter, became, a, devout, congregationalist, who, preached, the, need, to, christianize, the, nation, webster, viewed, language, as, a, means, to, control, disruptive, thoughts, his, american, dictionary, emphasized, the, virtues, of, social, control, over, human, passions, and, individualism, submission, to, authority, and, fear, of, god, they, were, necessary, for, the, maintenance, of, the, american, social, order, as, he, grew, older, webster, s, attitudes, changed, from, those, of, an, optimistic, revolutionary, in, the, 1780s, to, those, of, a, pessimistic, critic, of, man, and, society, by, the, 1820s, his, 1828, american, dictionary, contained, the, greatest, number, of, biblical, definitions, given, in, any, reference, volume, webster, said, of, education, education, is, useless, without, the, bible, the, bible, was, america, s, basic, text, book, in, all, fields, god, s, word, contained, in, the, bible, has, furnished, all, necessary, rules, to, direct, our, conduct, webster, released, his, own, edition, of, the, bible, in, 1833, called, the, common, version, he, used, the, king, james, version, kjv, as, a, base, and, consulted, the, hebrew, and, greek, along, with, various, other, versions, and, commentaries, webster, molded, the, kjv, to, correct, grammar, replaced, words, that, were, no, longer, used, and, removed, words, and, phrases, that, could, be, seen, as, offensive, in, 1834, he, published, value, of, the, bible, and,
