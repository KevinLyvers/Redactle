verses, in, urdu, but, started, writing, his, poetry, in, persian, after, this, visit, he, realized, that, the, literary, circle, of, calcutta, was, very, different, from, his, known, world, during, his, stay, in, kolkata, he, attended, many, literary, gatherings, which, were, not, courtly, in, nature, unlike, delhi, these, were, far, liberal, and, flexible, in, nature, which, is, imperative, for, any, individual, with, a, creative, bent, of, mind, mirza, ghalib, s, sojourn, in, calcutta, widened, the, horizons, of, his, literary, journey, he, established, himself, as, one, of, the, renowned, poets, in, calcutta, and, received, both, appreciation, and, criticism, from, the, enlightened, audience, of, the, city, during, this, time, he, penned, two, masnavis, in, persian, like, chiragh, e, dair, lamp, of, the, temple, and, bad, e, mukhalif, adverse, winds, his, letters, bear, a, testimony, of, his, tale, of, love, with, calcutta, in, a, letter, that, he, wrote, to, mirza, ali, bakhsh, khan, he, says, how, the, city, has, stolen, his, heart, and, left, him, mesmerized, he, referred, to, the, city, as, a, place, which, offered, a, remedy, for, everything, except, death, and, also, praised, the, talented, people, of, the, city, 1855, sir, syed, ahmed, khan, finished, his, scholarly, well, researched, and, illustrated, edition, of, abul, fazl, s, ai, n, e, akbari, having, finished, the, work, to, his, satisfaction, and, believing, that, mirza, asadullah, khan, ghalib, was, a, person, who, would, appreciate, his, labors, he, approached, the, great, ghalib, to, write, a, taqriz, in, the, convention, of, the, times, a, laudatory, foreword, for, it, ghalib, obliged, but, what, he, produced, was, a, short, persian, poem, castigating, the, ai, n, e, akbari, and, by, implication, the, imperial, sumptuous, literate, and, learned, mughal, culture, of, which, it, was, a, product, the, least, that, could, be, said, against, it, was, that, the, book, had, little, value, even, as, an, antique, document, ghalib, practically, reprimanded, khan, for, wasting, his, talents, and, time, on, dead, things, worse, he, highly, praised, the, sahibs, of, england, who, at, that, time, held, all, the, keys, to, all, the, a, ins, in, this, world, the, poem, was, unexpected, but, it, came, at, a, time, when, khan, s, thought, and, feelings, were, already, inclining, toward, change, ghalib, seemed, to, be, acutely, aware, of, a, european, sponsored, change, in, world, polity, especially, indian, polity, syed, ahmed, khan, might, well, have, been, piqued, at, ghalib, s, admonitions, but, he, would, also, have, realized, that, ghalib, s, reading, of, the, situation, though, not, nuanced, enough, was, basically, accurate, khan, may, also, have, felt, that, he, being, better, informed, about, the, english, and, the, outside, world, should, have, himself, seen, the, change, that, now, seemed, to, be, just, around, the, corner, sir, khan, never, again, wrote, a, word, in, praise, of, the, ai, n, e, akbari, and, in, fact, gave, up, taking, an, active, interest, in, history, and, archaeology, and, became, a, social, reformer, ghalib, placed, a, greater, emphasis, on, seeking, of, god, rather, than, ritualistic, religious, practices, although, he, followed, shia, theology, and, had, said, many, verses, in, praise, of, al, ibn, ab, lib, ghalib, states, the, object, of, my, worship, lies, beyond, perception, s, reach, for, men, who, see, the, qibla, is, a, compass, nothing, more, 79, like, many, other, urdu, poets, ghalib, was, capable, of, writing, profoundly, religious, poetry, yet, was, skeptical, about, some, interpretations, of, the, islamic, scriptures, done, by, certain, religious, leaders, 41, on, the, idea, of, paradise, he, once, wrote, in, his, persian, masnavi, abr, i, guhar, baar, how, canst, thou, burn, with, a, fire, mark, in, hell, a, heart, that, finds, no, rest, even, in, a, garden, and, in, paradise, it, is, true, that, i, shall, drink, at, dawn, the, pure, wine, mentioned, in, the, quran, but, where, shall, i, find, again, the, star, of, dawn, i, used, to, see, on, earth, and, my, crystal, cup, where, in, paradise, are, the, long, walks, of, intoxicated, friends, in, the, night, or, the, drunken, crowds, shouting, merrily, in, that, holy, tavern, silent, and, still, how, canst, thou, introduce, the, sounds, of, the, flute, and, the, gay, bustle, of, the, taverns, of, this, earth, where, shall, i, find, there, the, intoxication, of, raining, clouds, where, there, is, no, autumn, how, can, spring, exist, if, the, beautiful, houries, are, eternally, in, one, s, heart, what, of, the, sweet, thought, of, them, where, will, be, the, sadness, of, separation, and, the, joy, of, union, how, could, we, be, thankful, to, an, unknown, beauty, what, will, be, the, pleasure, of, a, sure, fruition, of, love, without, waiting, where, shall, we, find, there, a, girl, who, flees, away, when, we, would, kiss, her, where, will, be, there, one, who, betrays, us, with, false, oaths, of, love, the, beauties, of, paradise, will, obey, us, and, their, lips, will, never, say, anything, bitter, they, will, give, us, pleasure, but, with, a, heart, forever, closed, to, the, desire, for, pleasure, will, there, be, in, paradise, oglings, the, pleasure, of, coquettish, glances, from, afar, where, will, it, be, in, paradise, the, dear, window, in, a, well, known, wall, he, staunchly, disdained, the, practices, of, certain, ulema, who, in, his, poems, represent, narrow, mindedness, and, hypocrisy, 41, what, s, the, relation, between, the, preacher, and, the, door, of, the, tavern, but, believe, me, ghalib, i, am, sure, i, saw, him, slip, in, as, i, departed, 41, in, another, verse, directed, towards, certain, maulavis, clerics, he, criticized, them, for, their, ignorance, and, arrogant, certitude, look, deeper, it, is, you, alone, who, cannot, hear, the, music, of, his, secrets, 41, in, his, letters, ghalib, frequently, contrasted, the, narrow, legalism, of, the, ulema, with, its, pre, occupation, with, teaching, the, baniyas, and, the, brats, and, wallowing, in, the, problems, of, menstruation, and, menstrual, bleeding, and, real, spirituality, for, which, you, had, to, study, the, works, of, the, mystics, and, take, into, one, s, heart, the, essential, truth, of, god, s, reality, and, his, expression, in, all, things, 80, during, the, anti, british, rebellion, in, delhi, on, 5, october, 1857, three, weeks, after, the, british, troops,

muslim, to, which, ghalib, replied, sardonically, half, the, colonel, asked, what, does, that, mean, in, response, ghalib, said, i, drink, wine, but, i, don, t, eat, pork, 41, a, large, part, of,

come, why, does, not, the, last, trumpet, sound, who, holds, the, reins, of, the, final, catastrophe, ghalib, held, persian, in, high, regard, and, his, knowledge, of, the, language, was, a, point, of, pride, for, him, he, believed, his, compositions, in, persian, were, superior, to, those, in, urdu, and, hoped, readers, would, evaluate, him, by, the, former, see, my, persian, so, that, you,
