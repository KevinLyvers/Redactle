cyrus, hall, mccormick, february, 15, 1809, may, 13, 1884, was, an, american, inventor, and, businessman, who, founded, the, mccormick, harvesting, machine, company, which, later, became, part, of, the, international, harvester, company, in, 1902, originally, from, the, blue, ridge, mountains, of, virginia, he, and, many, members, of, the, mccormick, family, became, prominent, residents, of, chicago, mccormick, has, been, simplistically, credited, as, the, single, inventor, of, the, mechanical, reaper, he, was, however, one, of, several, designing, engineers, who, produced, successful, models, in, the, 1830s, his, efforts, built, on, more, than, two, decades, of, work, by, his, father, robert, mccormick, jr, with, the, aid, of, jo, anderson, an, enslaved, african, american, man, held, by, the, family, he, also, successfully, developed, a, modern, company, with, manufacturing, marketing, and, a, sales, force, to, market, his, products, cyrus, hall, mccormick, was, born, on, february, 15, 1809, in, raphine, virginia, he, was, the, eldest, of, eight, children, born, to, inventor, robert, mccormick, jr, 1780, 1846, and, mary, ann, polly, hall, 1780, 1853, as, cyrus, s, father, saw, the, potential, of, the, design, for, a, mechanical, reaper, he, applied, for, a, patent, to, claim, it, as, his, own, invention, he, worked, for, 28, years, on, a, horse, drawn, mechanical, reaper, to, harvest, grain, but, was, never, able, to, reproduce, a, reliable, version, building, on, his, father, s, years, of, development, cyrus, took, up, the, project, aided, by, jo, anderson, an, enslaved, african, american, man, held, on, the, mccormick, plantation, a, few, machines, based, on, a, design, of, patrick, bell, of, scotland, which, had, not, been, patented, were, available, in, the, united, states, in, these, years, the, bell, machine, was, pushed, by, horses, the, mccormick, design, was, pulled, by, horses, and, cut, the, grain, to, one, side, of, the, team, cyrus, mccormick, held, one, of, his, first, demonstrations, of, mechanical, reaping, at, the, nearby, village, of, steeles, tavern, virginia, in, 1831, he, claimed, to, have, developed, a, final, version, of, the, reaper, in, 18, months, the, young, mccormick, was, granted, a, patent, on, the, reaper, on, june, 21, 1834, two, years, after, having, been, granted, a, patent, for, a, self, sharpening, plow, none, was, sold, however, because, the, machine, could, not, handle, varying, conditions, the, mccormick, family, also, worked, together, in, a, blacksmith, metal, smelting, business, the, panic, of, 1837, almost, caused, the, family, to, go, into, bankruptcy, when, a, partner, pulled, out, in, 1839, mccormick, started, doing, more, public, demonstrations, of, the, reaper, but, local, farmers, still, thought, the, machine, was, unreliable, he, did, sell, one, in, 1840, but, none, for, 1841, using, the, endorsement, of, his, father, s, first, customer, for, a, machine, built, by, mcphetrich, cyrus, continually, attempted, to, improve, the, design, he, finally, sold, seven, reapers, in, 1842, 29, in, 1843, and, 50, in, 1844, they, were, all, built, manually, in, the, family, farm, shop, he, received, a, second, patent, for, reaper, improvements, on, january, 31, 1845, as, word, spread, about, the, reaper, mccormick, noticed, orders, arriving, from, farther, west, where, farms, tended, to, be, larger, and, the, land, flatter, while, he, was, in, washington, d, c, to, get, his, 1845, patent, he, heard, about, a, factory, in, brockport, new, york, where, he, contracted, to, have, the, machines, mass, produced, he, also, licensed, several, others, across, the, country, to, build, the, reaper, but, their, quality, often, proved, poor, which, hurt, the, product, s, reputation, in, 1847, after, their, father, s, death, cyrus, and, his, brother, leander, 1819, 1900, moved, to, chicago, where, they, established, a, factory, to, build, their, machines, at, the, time, other, cities, in, the, midwestern, united, states, such, as, cleveland, ohio, st, louis, missouri, and, milwaukee, wisconsin, were, more, established, and, prosperous, chicago, had, no, paved, streets, at, the, time, but, the, city, had, the, best, water, transportation, from, the, east, over, the, great, lakes, for, his, raw, materials, as, well, as, railroad, connections, to, the, farther, west, where, his, customers, would, be, when, mccormick, tried, to, renew, his, patent, in, 1848, the, u, s, patent, office, noted, that, a, similar, machine, had, already, been, patented, by, obed, hussey, a, few, months, earlier, mccormick, claimed, he, had, invented, his, machine, in, 1831, but, the, renewal, was, denied, william, manning, of, plainfield, new, jersey, had, also, received, a, patent, for, his, reaper, in, may, 1831, but, at, the, time, manning, was, evidently, not, defending, his, patent, mccormick, s, brother, william, 1815, 1865, moved, to, chicago, in, 1849, and, joined, the, company, to, take, care, of, financial, affairs, the, mccormick, reaper, sold, well, partially, as, a, result, of, savvy, and, innovative, business, practices, their, products, came, onto, the, market, just, as, the, development, of, railroads, offered, wide, distribution, to, distant, markets, mccormick, developed, marketing, and, sales, techniques, developing, a, wide, network, of, salesmen, trained, to, demonstrate, operation, of, the, machines, in, the, field, as, well, as, to, get, parts, quickly, and, repair, machines, in, the, field, if, necessary, during, crucial, times, in, the, farm, year, a, company, advertisement, was, a, take, off, of, the, westward, the, course, of, empire, takes, its, way, mural, by, emanuel, leutze, it, added, to, the, title, with, mccormick, reapers, in, the, van, in, 1851, mccormick, traveled, to, london, to, display, a, reaper, at, the, crystal, palace, exhibition, after, his, machine, successfully, harvested, a, field, of, green, wheat, while, the, hussey, machine, failed, he, won, a, gold, medal, and, was, admitted, to, the, legion, of, honor, his, celebration, was, short, lived, after, he, learned, that, he, had, lost, a, court, challenge, to, hussey, s, patent, another, mccormick, company, competitor, was, john, henry, manny, of, rockford, illinois, after, the, manny, reaper, beat, the, mccormick, version, at, the, paris, exposition, of, 1855, mccormick, filed, a, lawsuit, against, manny, for, patent, infringement, mccormick, demanded, that, manny, stop, producing, reapers, and, pay, mccormick, 400, 000, the, trial, originally, scheduled, for, chicago, in, september, 1855, featured, prominent, lawyers, on, both, sides, mccormick, hired, the, former, u, s, attorney, general, reverdy, johnson, and, new, york, patent, attorney, edward, nicholl, dickerson, manny, hired, george, harding, and, edwin, m, stanton, because, the, trial, was, set, to, take, place, in, illinois, harding, hired, the, local, illinois, lawyer, abraham, lincoln, the, trial, was, moved, to, cincinnati, ohio, however, manny, won, the, case, with, an, opinion, by, the, state, supreme, court, judge, john, mclean, lincoln, did, not, contribute, to, the, defense, stanton, had, objected, to, lincoln, s, presence, referring, to, him, as, that, damned, long, armed, ape, after, being, elected, president, five, years, later, lincoln, selected, stanton, to, be, his, secretary, of, war, where, he, became, one, of, lincoln, s, key, advisers, in, 1856, mccormick, s, factory, was, producing, more, than, 4000, reapers, each, year, mostly, sold, in, the, midwest, and, west, in, 1861, however, hussey, s, patent, was, extended, but, mccormick, s, was, not, mccormick, s, outspoken, opposition, to, lincoln, and, the, anti, slavery, republican, party, may, not, have, helped, his, cause, mccormick, decided, to, seek, help, from, the, u, s, congress, to, protect, his, patent, in, 1871, the, factory, burned, down, in, the, great, chicago, fire, but, mccormick, heeded, his, wife, s, advice, to, rebuild, and, it, reopened, in, 1873, even, as, mccormick, s, health, declined, so, she, took, a, greater, role, in, the, family, s, business, as, well, as, philanthropic, affairs, in, 1879, brother, leander, changed, the, company, s, name, from, cyrus, h, mccormick, and, brothers, to, mccormick, harvesting, machine, company, he, wanted, to, acknowledge, the, contributions, of, others, in, the, family, to, the, reaper, invention, and, company, especially, their, father, on,
