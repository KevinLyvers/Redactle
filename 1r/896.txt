third, son, of, a, great, indian, king, later, sources, draw, on, these, two, sources, adding, additional, details, including, a, change, to, being, descended, from, a, brahmin, king, which, accords, with, the, reign, of, the, pallavas, who, claim, to, belong, to, a, brahmin, lineage, the, western, regions, was, a, historical, name, specified, in, the, chinese, chronicles, between, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, 8th, century, ad, that, referred, to, the, regions, west, of, yumen, pass, most, often, central, asia, or, sometimes, more, specifically, the, easternmost, portion, of, it, e, g,

subcontinent, as, in, the, novel, journey, to, the, west, the, earliest, text, mentioning, bodhidharma, is, the, record, of, the, buddhist, monasteries, of, luoyang, chinese, lu, y, ng, qi, l, nj, which, was, compiled, in, 547, by, yang, xuanzhi, a, writer, and, translator, of, mahayana, sutras, into, chinese, yang, gave, the, following, account, at, that, time, there, was, a, monk, of, the,

country, i, have, not, visited, even, the, distant, buddha, realms, lack, this, he, chanted, homage, and, placed, his, palms, together, in, salutation, for, days, on, end, the, account, of, bodhidharma, in, the, luoyan, record, does, not, particularly, associate, him, with, meditation, but, rather, depicts, him, as, a, thaumaturge, capable, of, mystical, feats, this, may, have, played, a, role, in, his, subsequent, association, with, the, martial, arts, and, esoteric, knowledge, the, second, account, was, written, by, tanlin, 506, 574, tanlin, s, brief, biography, of, the, dharma, master, is, found, in, his, preface, to, the, long, scroll, of, the, treatise, on, the, two, entrances, and, four, practices, a, text, traditionally, attributed, to, bodhidharma, and, the, first, text, to, identify, him, as, south, indian, the, dharma, master, was, a, south, indian, of, the, western, region, he, was, the, third, son, of, a, great, indian, king, his, ambition, lay, in, the, mahayana, path, and, so, he, put, aside, his, white, layman, s, robe, for, the, black, robe, of, a, monk, lamenting, the, decline, of, the, true, teaching, in, the, outlands, he, subsequently, crossed, distant, mountains, and, seas, traveling, about, propagating, the, teaching, in, han, and, wei, tanlin, s, account, was, the, first, to, mention, that, bodhidharma, attracted, disciples, specifically, mentioning, daoyu, and, dazu, huike, the, latter, of, whom, would, later, figure, very, prominently, in, the, bodhidharma, literature, although, tanlin, has, traditionally, been, considered, a, disciple, of, bodhidharma, it, is, more, likely, that, he, was, a, student, of, huike, the, record, of, the, masters, and, students, of, the, la, ka, l, ngqi, sh, z, j, which, survives, both, in, chinese, and, in, tibetan, translation, although, the, surviving, tibetan, translation, is, apparently, of, older, provenance, than, the, surviving, chinese, version, states, that, bodhidharma, is, not, the, first, ancestor, of, zen, but, instead, the, second, this, text, instead, claims, that, gu, abhadra, the, translator, of, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, is, the, first, ancestor, in, the, lineage, it, further, states, that, bodhidharma, was, his, student, the, tibetan, translation, is, estimated, to, have, been, made, in, the, late, eighth, or, early, ninth, century, indicating, that, the, original, chinese, text, was, written, at, some, point, before, that, tanlin, s, preface, has, also, been, preserved, in, jingjue, s, 683, 750, lengjie, shizi, ji, chronicle, of, the, la, k, vat, ra, masters, which, dates, from, 713, to, 716, ca, 715, he, writes, the, teacher, of, the, dharma, who, came, from, south, india, in, the, western, regions, the, third, son, of, a, great, brahman, king, in, the, 7th, century, historical, work, further, biographies, of, eminent, monks, x, g, os, ng, zhu, n, daoxuan, possibly, drew, on, tanlin, s, preface, as, a, basic, source, but, made, several, significant, additions, firstly, daoxuan, adds, more, detail, concerning, bodhidharma, s, origins, writing, that, he, was, of, south, indian, brahman, stock, n, n, ti, nzh, p, lu, m, n, zh, ng, secondly, more, detail, is, provided, concerning, bodhidharma, s, journeys, tanlin, s, original, is, imprecise, about, bodhidharma, s, travels, saying, only, that, he, crossed, distant, mountains, and, seas, before, arriving, in, wei, daoxuan, s, account, however, implies, a, specific, itinerary, he, first, arrived, at, nan, y, eh, during, the, sung, period, from, there, he, turned, north, and, came, to, the, kingdom, of, wei, this, implies, that, bodhidharma, had, travelled, to, china, by, sea, and, that, he, had, crossed, over, the, yangtze, thirdly, daoxuan, suggests, a, date, for, bodhidharma, s, arrival, in, china, he, writes, that, bodhidharma, makes, landfall, in, the, time, of, the, song, thus, making, his, arrival, no, later, than, the, time, of, the, song, s, fall, to, the, southern, qi, in, 479, finally, daoxuan, provides, information, concerning, bodhidharma, s, death, bodhidharma, he, writes, died, at, the, banks, of, the, luo, river, where, he, was, interred, by, his, disciple, dazu, huike, possibly, in, a, cave, according, to, daoxuan, s, chronology, bodhidharma, s, death, must, have, occurred, prior, to, 534, the, date, of, the, northern, wei, s, fall, because, dazu, huike, subsequently, leaves, luoyang, for, ye, furthermore, citing, the, shore, of, the, luo, river, as, the, place, of, death, might, possibly, suggest, that, bodhidharma, died, in, the, mass, executions, at, heyin, in, 528, supporting, this, possibility, is, a, report, in, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, stating, that, a, buddhist, monk, was, among, the, victims, at, h, y, n, in, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, z, t, ngj, of, 952, the, elements, of, the, traditional, bodhidharma, story, are, in, place, bodhidharma, is, said, to, have, been, a, disciple, of, praj, t, ra, thus, establishing, the, latter, as, the, 27th, patriarch, in, india, after, a, three, year, journey, bodhidharma, reached, china, in, 527, during, the, liang, as, opposed, to, the, song, in, daoxuan, s, text, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, includes, bodhidharma, s, encounter, with, emperor, wu, of, liang, which, was, first, recorded, around, 758, in, the, appendix, to, a, text, by, shenhui, a, disciple, of, huineng, finally, as, opposed, to, daoxuan, s, figure, of, over, 180, years, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, states, that, bodhidharma, died, at, the, age, of, 150, he, was, then, buried, on, mount, xiong, er, to, the, west, of, luoyang, however, three, years, after, the, burial, in, the, pamir, mountains, song, yun, an, official, of, one, of, the, later, wei, kingdoms, encountered, bodhidharma, who, claimed, to, be, returning, to, india, and, was, carrying, a, single, sandal, bodhidharma, predicted, the, death, of, song, yun, s, ruler, a, prediction, which, was, borne, out, upon, the, latter, s, return, bodhidharma, s, tomb, was, then, opened, and, only, a, single, sandal, was, found, inside, according, to, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, bodhidharma, left, the, liang, court, in, 527, and, relocated, to, mount, song, near, luoyang, and, the, shaolin, monastery, where, he, faced, a, wall, for, nine, years, not, speaking, for, the, entire, time, his, date, of, death, can, have, been, no, earlier, than, 536, moreover, his, encounter, with, the, wei, official, indicates, a, date, of, death, no, later, than, 554, three, years, before, the, fall, of, the, western, wei, subsequent, to, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, the, only, dated, addition, to, the, biography, of, bodhidharma, is, in, the, jingde, records, of, the, transmission, of, the, lamp, j, ngd, chu, nd, ng, l, published, 1004, ce, by, daoyuan, in, which, it, is, stated, that, bodhidharma, s, original, name, had, been, bodhit, ra, but, was, changed, by, his, master, praj, t, ra, the, same, account, is, given, by, the, japanese, master, keizan, s, 13th, century, work, of, the, same, title, several, contemporary, popular, traditions, also, exist, regarding, bodhidharma, s, origins, an, indian, tradition, regards, bodhidharma, to, be, the, third, son, of, a, pallava, king, from, kanchipuram, this, is, consistent, with, the, southeast, asian, traditions, which, also, describe, bodhidharma, as, a, former, south, indian, tamil, prince, who, had, awakened, his, kundalini, and, renounced, royal, life, to, become, a, monk, the, tibetan, version, similarly, characterises, him, as, a, dark, skinned, siddha, from, south, india, conversely, the, japanese, tradition, generally, regards, bodhidharma, as, a, red, haired, persian, bodhidharma, is, traditionally, seen, as, introducing, a, mahayana, buddhist, practice, of, dhyana, meditation, in, china, according, to, modern, scholars, like, the, japanese, scholar, of, chan, yanagida, seizan, generally, hold, that, the, two, entrances, and, four, practices, is, the, only, extant, work, that, can, be, attributed, to, bodhidharma, and, as, such, this, is, the, main, source, for, our, knowledge, of, his, teaching, according, to, this, text, bodhidharma, taught, two, entrances, to, the, dharma, the, first, is, a, subitist, teaching, that, directly, apprehends, the, ultimate, principle, or, true, nature, of, reality, buddha, nature, the, second, entrance, deals, with, four, practices, 1, accepting, all, our, sufferings, as, the, fruit, of, past, karma, 2, accept, our, circumstances, with, equanimity, 3, to, be, without, craving, and, 4, to, let, go, of, wrong, thoughts, and, practice, the, six, perfections, according, to, yanagida, seizan, the, first, entrance, of, principle, was, a, subitist, teaching, which, derives, from, the, sudden, enlightenment, thought, of, tao, sheng, while, the, four, practices, are, a, reworking, of, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, which, were, popular, in, the, late, six, dynasties, period, buddhist, meditation, circles, tanlin, in, the, preface, to, two, entrances, and, four, practices, and, daoxuan, in, the, further, biographies, of, eminent, monks, mentions, a, practice, of, bodhidharma, s, termed, wall, gazing, b, gu, n, both, tanlin, and, daoxuan, associate, this, wall, gazing, with, quieting, mind, chinese, pinyin, nx, n, in, the, two, entrances, and, four, practices, the, term, wall, gazing, is, given, as, follows, those, who, turn, from, delusion, back, to, reality, who, meditate, on, walls, the, absence, of, self, and, other, the, oneness, of, mortal, and, sage, and, who, remain, unmoved, even, by, scriptures, are, in, complete, and, unspoken, agreement, with, reason, daoxuan, states, the, merits, of, mah, y, na, wall, gazing, are, the, highest, these, are, the, first, mentions, in, the, historical, record, of, what, may, be, a, type, of, meditation, being, ascribed, to, bodhidharma, exactly, what, sort, of, practice, bodhidharma, s, wall, gazing, was, remains, uncertain, nearly, all, accounts, have, treated, it, either, as, an, undefined, variety, of, meditation, as, daoxuan, and, dumoulin, or, as, a, variety, of, seated, meditation, akin, to, the, zazen, chinese, pinyin, zu, ch, n, that, later, became, a, defining, characteristic, of, chan, the, latter, interpretation, is, particularly, common, among, those, working, from, a, chan, standpoint, there, have, also, however, been, interpretations, of, wall, gazing, as, a, non, meditative, phenomenon, jeffrey, broughton, points, out, that, where, bodhidharma, s, teachings, appear, in, tibetan, translation, among, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, the, chinese, phrase, in, a, coagulated, state, abides, in, wall, examining, ning, chu, pi, kuan, is, replaced, in, tibetan, with, rejects, discrimination, and, abides, in, brightness, rtogs, pa, spangs, te, lham, mer, gnas, na, broughton, sees, this, as, a, curious, divergence, as, tibetan, translations, of, chinese, chan, texts, are, usually, quite, literal, he, concludes, that, in, early, tibet, wall, examining, did, not, refer, to, a, literal, practice, of, sitting, cross, legged, facing, a, wall, there, are, early, texts, which, explicitly, associate, bodhidharma, with, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, daoxuan, for, example, in, a, late, recension, of, his, biography, of, bodhidharma, s, successor, huike, has, the, s, tra, as, a, basic, and, important, element, of, the, teachings, passed, down, by, bodhidharma, in, the, beginning, dhyana, master, bodhidharma, took, the, four, roll, la, k, s, tra, handed, it, over, to, huike, and, said, when, i, examine, the, land, of, china, it, is, clear, that, there, is, only, this, sutra, if, you, rely, on, it, to, practice, you, will, be, able, to, cross, over, the, world, another, early, text, the, record, of, the, masters, and, disciples, of, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, chinese, pinyin, l, ngqi, sh, z, j, of, jingjue, 683, 750, also, mentions, bodhidharma, in, relation, to, this, text, jingjue, s, account, also, makes, explicit, mention, of, sitting, meditation, or, zazen, for, all, those, who, sat, in, meditation, master, bodhi, also, offered, expositions, of, the, main, portions, of, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, which, are, collected, in, a, volume, of, twelve, or, thirteen, pages, bearing, the, title, of, teaching, of, dharma, in, other, early, texts, the, school, that, would, later, become, known, as, chan, buddhism, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, la, k, vat, ra, school, l, ngqi, z, ng, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, one, of, the, mahayana, sutras, is, a, highly, difficult, and, obscure, text, whose, basic, thrust, is, to, emphasize, the, inner, enlightenment, that, does, away, with, all, duality, and, is, raised, above, all, distinctions, it, is, among, the, first, and, most, important, texts, for, east, asian, yog, c, ra, according, to, suzuki, one, of, the, recurrent, emphases, in, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, is, a, lack, of, reliance, on, words, to, effectively, express, reality, if, mahamati, you, say, that, because, of, the, reality, of, words, the, objects, are, this, talk, lacks, in, sense, words, are, not, known, in, all, the, buddha, lands, words, mahamati, are, an, artificial, creation, in, some, buddha, lands, ideas, are, indicated, by, looking, steadily, in, others, by, gestures, in, still, others, by, a, frown, by, the, movement, of, the, eyes, by, laughing, by, yawning, or, by, the, clearing, of, the, throat, or, by, recollection, or, by, trembling, in, contrast, to, the, ineffectiveness, of, words, the, s, tra, instead, stresses, the, importance, of, the, self, realization, that, is, attained, by, noble, wisdom, and, according, to, suzuki, occurs, when, one, has, an, insight, into, reality, as, it, is, the, truth, is, the, state, of, self, realization, and, is, beyond, categories, of, discrimination, according, to, suzuki, reflecting, his, own, emphasis, on, kensho, the, s, tra, goes, on, to, outline, the, ultimate, effects, of, an, experience, of, self, realization, will, become, thoroughly, conversant, with, the, noble, truth, of, self, realization, will, become, a, perfect, master, of, his, own, mind, will, conduct, himself, without, effort, will, be, like, a, gem, reflecting, a, variety, of, colours, will, be, able, to, assume, the, body, of, transformation, will, be, able, to, enter, into, the, subtle, minds, of, all, beings, and, because, of, his, firm, belief, in, the, truth, of, mind, only, will, by, gradually, ascending, the, stages, become, established, in, buddhahood, several, stories, about, bodhidharma, have, become, popular, legends, which, are, still, being, used, in, the, ch, an, seon, and, zen, tradition, the, anthology, of, the, patriarchal, hall, says, that, in, 527, bodhidharma, visited, emperor, wu, of, liang, a, fervent, patron, of, buddhism, emperor, wu, how, much, karmic, merit, have, i, earned, for, ordaining, buddhist, monks, building, monasteries, having, sutras, copied, and, commissioning, buddha, images, bodhidharma, none, good, deeds, done, with, worldly, intent, bring, good, karma, but, no, merit, emperor, wu, so, what, is, the, highest, meaning, of, noble, truth, bodhidharma, there, is, no, noble, truth, there, is, only, emptiness, emperor, wu, then, who, is, standing, before, me, bodhidharma, i, know, not, your, majesty, this, encounter, was, included, as, the, first, k, an, of, the, blue, cliff, record, failing, to, make, a, favorable, impression, in, south, china, bodhidharma, is, said, to, have, travelled, to, the, shaolin, monastery, after, either, being, refused, entry, or, being, ejected, after, a, short, time, he, lived, in, a, nearby, cave, where, he, faced, a, wall, for, nine, years, not, speaking, for, the, entire, time, the, biographical, tradition, is, littered, with, apocryphal, tales, about, bodhidharma, s, life, and, circumstances, in, one, version, of, the, story, he, is, said, to, have, fallen, asleep, seven, years, into, his, nine, years, of, wall, gazing, becoming, angry, with, himself, he, cut, off, his, eyelids, to, prevent, it, from, happening, again, according, to, the, legend, as, his, eyelids, hit, the, floor, the, first, tea, plants, sprang, up, and, thereafter, tea, would, provide, a, stimulant, to, help, keep, students, of, chan, awake, during, zazen, the, most, popular, account, relates, that, bodhidharma, was, admitted, into, the, shaolin, temple, after, nine, years, in, the, cave, and, taught, there, for, some, time, however, other, versions, report, that, he, passed, away, seated, upright, or, that, he, disappeared, leaving, behind, the, yijin, jing, or, that, his, legs, atrophied, after, nine, years, of, sitting, which, is, why, daruma, dolls, have, no, legs, in, one, legend, bodhidharma, refused, to, resume, teaching, until, his, would, be, student, dazu, huike, who, had, kept, vigil, for, weeks, in, the, deep, snow, outside, of, the, monastery, cut, off, his, own, left, arm, to, demonstrate, sincerity,

of, the, treatise, on, the, two, entrances, and, four, practices, and, the, continued, biographies, of, eminent, monks, daoyu, and, dazu, huike, are, the, only, explicitly, identified, disciples, of, bodhidharma, the, epitaph, gives, a, line, of, descent, identifying, bodhidharma, as, the, first, patriarch, in, the, 6th, century, the, biographies, of, famous, monks, were, collected, from, this, genre, the, typical, chan, lineage, was, developed, these, famous, biographies, were, non, sectarian, the, ch, an, biographical, works, however, aimed, to, establish, ch, an, as, a, legitimate, school, of, buddhism, traceable, to, its, indian, origins, and, at, the, same, time, championed, a, particular, form, of, ch, an, historical, accuracy, was, of, little, concern, to, the, compilers, old, legends, were, repeated, new, stories, were, invented, and, reiterated, until, they, too, became, legends, according, to, mcrae, it, is, not, clear, that, the, practitioners, surrounding, bodhidharma, and, his, disciple, huike, considered, themselves, as, belonging, to, a, unified, movement, or, group, such, as, a, chan, school, nor, did, they, have, any, sense, of, sharing, any, continuity, with, the, later, tradition, he, says, even, the, name, proto, chan, is, not, really, reflective, of, their, activities, d, t, suzuki, contends, that, chan, s, growth, in, popularity, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, attracted, criticism, that, it, had, no, authorized, records, of, its, direct, transmission, from, the, founder, of, buddhism, and, that, chan, historians, made, bodhidharma, the, 28th, patriarch, of, buddhism, in, response, to, such, attacks, the, earliest, lineages, described, the, lineage, from, bodhidharma, into, the, 5th, to, 7th, generation, of, patriarchs, various, records, of, different, authors, are, known, which, give, a, variation, of, transmission, lines, eventually, these, descriptions, of, the, lineage, evolved, into, a, continuous, lineage, from, kyamuni, buddha, to, bodhidharma, the, idea, of, a, line, of, descent, from, kyamuni, buddha, is, the, basis, for, the, distinctive, lineage, tradition, of, chan, buddhism, according, to, the, song, of, enlightenment, zh, ngd, o, g, by, yongjia, xuanjue, bodhidharma, was, the, 28th, patriarch, of, chan, in, a, line, of, descent, from, gautama, buddha, via, his, disciple, mah, k, yapa, mahakashyapa, was, the, first, leading, the, line, of, transmission, twenty, eight, fathers, followed, him, in, the, west, the, lamp, was, then, brought, over, the, sea, to, this, country, and, bodhidharma, became, the, first, father, here, his, mantle, as, we, all, know, passed, over, six, fathers, and, by, them, many, minds, came, to, see, the, light, the, transmission, of, the, light, gives, 28, patriarchs, in, this, transmission, bodhidharma, has, been, the, subject, of, critical, scientific, research, which, has, shed, new, light, on, the, traditional, stories, about, bodhidharma, according, to, john, mcrae, bodhidharma, has, been, the, subject, of, a, hagiographic, process, which, served, the, needs, of, chan, buddhism, according, to, him, it, is, not, possible, to, write, an, accurate, biography, of, bodhidharma, it, is, ultimately, impossible, to, reconstruct, any, original, or, accurate, biography, of, the, man, whose, life, serves, as, the, original, trace, of, his, hagiography, where, trace, is, a, term, from, jacques, derrida, meaning, the, beginningless, beginning, of, a, phenomenon, the, imagined, but, always, intellectually, unattainable, origin, hence, any, such, attempt, by, modern, biographers, to, reconstruct, a, definitive, account, of, bodhidharma, s, life, is, both, doomed, to, failure, and, potentially, no, different, in, intent, from, the, hagiographical, efforts, of, premodern, writers, mcrae, s, standpoint, accords, with, yanagida, s, standpoint, yanagida, ascribes, great, historical, value, to, the, witness, of, the, disciple, tanlin, but, at, the, same, time, acknowledges, the, presence, of, many, puzzles, in, the, biography, of, bodhidharma, given, the, present, state, of, the, sources, he, considers, it, impossible, to, compile, a, reliable, account, of, bodhidharma, s, life, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, composed, image, of, bodhidharma, depended, on, the, combination, of, supposed, historical, information, on, various, historical, figures, over, several, centuries, bodhidharma, as, a, historical, person, may, even, never, have, actually, existed, dumoulin, comments, on, the, three, principal, sources, the, persian, heritage, is, doubtful, according, to, dumoulin, in, the, description, of, the, lo, yang, temple, bodhidharma, is, called, a, persian, given, the, ambiguity, of, geographical, references, in, writings, of, this, period, such, a, statement, should, not, be, taken, too, seriously, dumoulin, considers, tanlin, s, account, of, bodhidharma, being, the, third, son, of, a, great, brahman, king, to, be, a, later, addition, and, finds, the, exact, meaning, of, south, indian, brahman, stock, unclear, and, when, daoxuan, speaks, of, origins, from, south, indian, brahman, stock, it, is, not, clear, whether, he, is, referring, to, roots, in, nobility, or, to, india, in, general, as, the, land, of, the, brahmans, these, chinese, sources, lend, themselves, to, make, inferences, about, bodhidharma, s, origins, the, third, son, of, a, brahman, king, has, been, speculated, to, mean, the, third, son, of, a, pallava, king, based, on, a, specific, pronunciation, of, the, chinese, characters, as, kang, zhi, meaning, fragrance, extreme, tsutomu, kambe, identifies, to, be, kanchipuram, an, old, capital, town, in, the, state, tamil, nadu, india, according, to, tsutomu, kambe, kanchi, means, a, radiant, jewel, or, a, luxury, belt, with, jewels, and, puram, means, a, town, or, a, state, in, the, sense, of, earlier, times, thus, it, is, understood, that, the, kingdom, corresponds, to, the, old, capital, kanchipuram, acharya, raghu, in, his, work, bodhidharma, retold, used, a, combination, of, multiple, factors, to, identify, bodhidharma, from, the, state, of, andhra, pradesh, in, south, india, specifically, to, the, geography, around, mt, sailum, or, modern, day, srisailam, the, pakistani, scholar, ahmad, hasan, dani, speculated, that, according, to, popular, accounts, in, pakistan, s, northwest, bodhidharma, may, be, from, the, region, around, the, peshawar, valley, or, possibly, around, modern, afghanistan, s, eastern, border, with, pakistan, in, the, context, of, the, indian, caste, system, the, mention, of, brahman, king, acquires, a, nuance, broughton, notes, that, king, implies, that, bodhidharma, was, of, a, caste, of, warriors, and, rulers, brahman, is, in, western, contexts, easily, understood, as, brahmana, or, brahmin, which, means, priest, according, to, tradition, bodhidharma, was, given, this, name, by, his, teacher, known,
