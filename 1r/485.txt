and, piano, pieces, and, some, sacred, music, he, set, new, standards, for, both, comic, and, serious, opera, before, retiring, from, large, scale, composition, while, still, in, his, thirties, at, the, height, of, his, popularity, born, in, pesaro, to, parents, who, were, both, musicians, his, father, a, trumpeter, his, mother, a, singer, rossini, began, to, compose, by, the, age, of, twelve,

theatres, in, naples, in, the, period, 1810, 1823, he, wrote, 34, operas, for, the, italian, stage, that, were, performed, in, venice, milan, ferrara, naples, and, elsewhere, this, productivity, necessitated, an, almost, formulaic, approach, for, some, components, such, as, overtures, and, a, certain, amount, of, self, borrowing, during, this, period, he, produced, his, most, popular, works, including, the, comic, operas, l, italiana, in, algeri, il, barbiere, di, siviglia, known, in, english, as, the, barber, of, seville, and, la, cenerentola, which, brought, to, a, peak, the, opera, buffa, tradition, he, inherited, from, masters, such, as, domenico, cimarosa, and, giovanni, paisiello, he, also, composed, opera, seria, works, such, as, tancredi, otello, and, semiramide, all, of, these, attracted, admiration, for, their, innovation, in, melody, harmonic, and, instrumental, colour, and, dramatic, form, in, 1824, he, was, contracted, by, the, op, ra, in, paris, for, which, he, produced, an, opera, to, celebrate, the, coronation, of, charles, x, il, viaggio, a, reims, later, cannibalised, for, his, first, opera, in, french, le, comte, ory, revisions, of, two, of, his, italian, operas, le, si, ge, de, corinthe, and, mo, se, and, in, 1829, his, last, opera, guillaume, tell, rossini, s, withdrawal, from, opera, for, the, last, 40, years, of, his, life, has, never, been, fully, explained, contributory, factors, may, have, been, ill, health, the, wealth, his, success, had, brought, him, and, the, rise, of, spectacular, grand, opera, under, composers, such, as, giacomo, meyerbeer, from, the, early, 1830s, to, 1855, when, he, left, paris, and, was, based, in, bologna, rossini, wrote, relatively, little, on, his, return, to, paris, in, 1855, he, became, renowned, for, his, musical, salons, on, saturdays, regularly, attended, by, musicians, and, the, artistic, and, fashionable, circles, of, paris, for, which, he, wrote, the, entertaining, pieces, p, ch, s, de, vieillesse, guests, included, franz, liszt, anton, rubinstein, giuseppe, verdi, meyerbeer, and, joseph, joachim, rossini, s, last, major, composition, was, his, petite, messe, solennelle,

rossini, a, trumpeter, and, horn, player, and, his, wife, anna, n, e, guidarini, a, seamstress, by, trade, daughter, of, a, baker, giuseppe, rossini, was, charming, but, impetuous, and, feckless, the, burden, of, supporting, the, family, and, raising, the, child, fell, mainly, on, anna, with, some, help, from, her, mother, and, mother, in, law, stendhal, who, published, a, colourful, biography, of, rossini, in, 1824, wrote, rossini, s, portion, from, his, father, was, the, true, native, heirship, of, an, italian, a, little, music, a, little, religion, and, a, volume, of, ariosto, the, rest, of, his, education, was, consigned, to, the, legitimate, school, of, southern, youth, the, society, of, his, mother, the, young, singing, girls, of, the, company, those, prima, donnas, in, embryo, and, the, gossips, of, every, village, through, which, they, passed, this, was, aided, and, refined, by, the, musical, barber, and, news, loving, coffee, house, keeper, of, the, papal, village, giuseppe, was, imprisoned, at, least, twice, first, in, 1790, for, insubordination, to, local, authorities, in, a, dispute, about, his, employment, as, town, trumpeter, and, in, 1799, and, 1800, for, republican, activism, and, support, of, the, troops, of, napoleon, against, the, pope, s, austrian, backers, in, 1798, when, rossini, was, aged, six, his, mother, began, a, career, as, a, professional, singer, in, comic, opera, and, for, a, little, over, a, decade, was, a, considerable, success, in, cities, including, trieste, and, bologna, before, her, untrained, voice, began, to, fail, in, 1802, the, family, moved, to, lugo, near, ravenna, where, rossini, received, a, good, basic, education, in, italian, latin, and, arithmetic, as, well, as, music, he, studied, the, horn, with, his, father, and, other, music, with, a, priest, giuseppe, malerbe, whose, extensive, library, contained, works, by, haydn, and, mozart, both, little, known, in, italy, at, the, time, but, inspirational, to, the, young, rossini, he, was, a, quick, learner, and, by, the, age, of, twelve, he, had, composed, a, set, of, six, sonatas, for, four, stringed, instruments, which, were, performed, under, the, aegis, of, a, rich, patron, in, 1804, two, years, later, he, was, admitted, to, the, recently, opened, liceo, musicale, bologna, initially, studying, singing, cello, and, piano, and, joining, the, composition, class, soon, afterwards, he, wrote, some, substantial, works, while, a, student, including, a, mass, and, a, cantata, and, after, two, years, he, was, invited, to, continue, his, studies, he, declined, the, offer, the, strict, academic, regime, of, the, liceo, had, given, him, a, solid, compositional, technique, but, as, his, biographer, richard, osborne, puts, it, his, instinct, to, continue, his, education, in, the, real, world, finally, asserted, itself, while, still, at, the, liceo, rossini, had, performed, in, public, as, a, singer, and, worked, in, theatres, as, a, r, p, titeur, and, keyboard, soloist, in, 1810, at, the, request, of, the, popular, tenor, domenico, mombelli, he, wrote, his, first, operatic, score, a, two, act, operatic, dramma, serio, demetrio, e, polibio, to, a, libretto, by, mombelli, s, wife, it, was, publicly, staged, in, 1812, after, the, composer, s, first, successes, rossini, and, his, parents, concluded, that, his, future, lay, in, composing, operas, the, main, operatic, centre, in, northeastern, italy, was, venice, under, the, tutelage, of, the, composer, giovanni, morandi, a, family, friend, rossini, moved, there, in, late, 1810, when, he, was, eighteen, rossini, s, first, opera, to, be, staged, was, la, cambiale, di, matrimonio, a, one, act, comedy, given, at, the, small, teatro, san, mois, in, november, 1810, the, piece, was, a, great, success, and, rossini, received, what, then, seemed, to, him, a, considerable, sum, forty, scudi, an, amount, i, had, never, seen, brought, together, he, later, described, the, san, mois, as, an, ideal, theatre, for, a, young, composer, learning, his, craft, everything, tended, to, facilitate, the, d, but, of, a, novice, composer, it, had, no, chorus, and, a, small, company, of, principals, its, main, repertoire, consisted, of, one, act, comic, operas, farse, staged, with, modest, scenery, and, minimal, rehearsal, rossini, followed, the, success, of, his, first, piece, with, three, more, farse, for, the, house, l, inganno, felice, 1812, la, scala, di, seta, 1812, and, il, signor, bruschino, 1813, rossini, maintained, his, links, with, bologna, where, in, 1811, he, had, a, success, directing, haydn, s, the, seasons, and, a, failure, with, his, first, full, length, opera, l, equivoco, stravagante, he, also, worked, for, opera, houses, in, ferrara, and, rome, in, mid, 1812, he, received, a, commission, from, la, scala, milan, where, his, two, act, comedy, la, pietra, del, paragone, ran, for, fifty, three, performances, a, considerable, run, for, the, time, which, brought, him, not, only, financial, benefits, but, exemption, from, military, service, and, the, title, of, maestro, di, cartello, a, composer, whose, name, on, advertising, posters, guaranteed, a, full, house, the, following, year, his, first, opera, seria, tancredi, did, well, at, la, fenice, in, venice, and, even, better, at, ferrara, with, a, rewritten, tragic, ending, the, success, of, tancredi, made, rossini, s, name, known, internationally, productions, of, the, opera, followed, in, london, 1820, and, new, york, 1825, within, weeks, of, tancredi, rossini, had, another, box, office, success, with, his, comedy, l, italiana, in, algeri, composed, in, great, haste, and, premiered, in, may, 1813, 1814, was, a, less, remarkable, year, for, the, rising, composer, neither, il, turco, in, italia, or, sigismondo, pleasing, the, milanese, or, venetian, public, respectively, 1815, marked, an, important, stage, in, rossini, s, career, in, may, he, moved, to, naples, to, take, up, the, post, of, director, of, music, for, the, royal, theatres, these, included, the, teatro, di, san, carlo, the, city, s, leading, opera, house, its, manager, domenico, barbaia, was, to, be, an, important, influence, on, the, composer, s, career, there, the, musical, establishment, of, naples, was, not, immediately, welcoming, to, rossini, who, was, seen, as, an, intruder, into, its, cherished, operatic, traditions, the, city, had, once, been, the, operatic, capital, of, europe, the, memory, of, cimarosa, was, revered, and, paisiello, was, still, living, but, there, were, no, local, composers, of, any, stature, to, follow, them, and, rossini, quickly, won, the, public, and, critics, round, rossini, s, first, work, for, the, san, carlo, elisabetta, regina, d, inghilterra, was, a, dramma, per, musica, in, two, acts, in, which, he, reused, substantial, sections, of, his, earlier, works, unfamiliar, to, the, local, public, the, rossini, scholars, philip, gossett, and, patricia, brauner, write, it, is, as, if, rossini, wished, to, present, himself, to, the, neapolitan, public, by, offering, a, selection, of, the, best, music, from, operas, unlikely, to, be, revived, in, naples, the, new, opera, was, received, with, tremendous, enthusiasm, as, was, the, neapolitan, premiere, of, l, italiana, in, algeri, and, rossini, s, position, in, naples, was, assured, for, the, first, time, rossini, was, able, to, write, regularly, for, a, resident, company, of, first, rate, singers, and, a, fine, orchestra, with, adequate, rehearsals, and, schedules, that, made, it, unnecessary, to, compose, in, a, rush, to, meet, deadlines, between, 1815, and, 1822, he, composed, eighteen, more, operas, nine, for, naples, and, nine, for, opera, houses, in, other, cities, in, 1816, for, the, teatro, argentina, in, rome, he, composed, the, opera, that, was, to, become, his, best, known, il, barbiere, di, siviglia, the, barber, of, seville, there, was, already, a, popular, opera, of, that, title, by, paisiello, and, rossini, s, version, was, originally, given, the, same, title, as, its, hero, almaviva, despite, an, unsuccessful, opening, night, with, mishaps, on, stage, and, many, pro, paisiello, and, anti, rossini, audience, members, the, opera, quickly, became, a, success, and, by, the, time, of, its, first, revival, in, bologna, a, few, months, later, it, was, billed, by, its, present, italian, title, and, it, rapidly, eclipsed, paisiello, s, setting, rossini, s, operas, for, the, teatro, san, carlo, were, substantial, mainly, serious, pieces, his, otello, 1816, provoked, lord, byron, to, write, they, have, been, crucifying, othello, into, an, opera, music, good, but, lugubrious, but, as, for, the, words, nonetheless, the, piece, proved, generally, popular, and, held, the, stage, in, frequent, revivals, until, it, was, overshadowed, by, verdi, s, version, seven, decades, later, among, his, other, works, for, the, house, were, mos, in, egitto, based, on, the, biblical, story, of, moses, and, the, exodus, from, egypt, 1818, and, la, donna, del, lago, from, sir, walter, scott, s, poem, the, lady, of, the, lake, 1819, for, la, scala, he, wrote, the, opera, semiseria, la, gazza, ladra, 1817, and, for, rome, his, version, of, the, cinderella, story, la, cenerentola, 1817, in, 1817, came, the, first, performance, of, one, of, his, operas, l, italiana, at, the, the, tre, italien, in, paris, its, success, led, to, others, of, his, operas, being, staged, there, and, eventually, to, his, contract, in, paris, from, 1824, to, 1830, rossini, kept, his, personal, life, as, private, as, possible, but, he, was, known, for, his, susceptibility, to, singers, in, the, companies, he, worked, with, among, his, lovers, in, his, early, years, were, ester, mombelli, domenico, s, daughter, and, maria, marcolini, of, the, bologna, company, by, far, the, most, important, of, these, relationships, both, personal, and, professional, was, with, isabella, colbran, prima, donna, of, the, teatro, san, carlo, and, former, mistress, of, barbaia, rossini, had, heard, her, sing, in, bologna, in, 1807, and, when, he, moved, to, naples, he, wrote, a, succession, of, important, roles, for, her, in, opere, serie, by, the, early, 1820s, rossini, was, beginning, to, tire, of, naples, the, failure, of, his, operatic, tragedy, ermione, the, previous, year, convinced, him, that, he, and, the, neapolitan, audiences, had, had, enough, of, each, other, an, insurrection, in, naples, against, the, monarchy, though, quickly, crushed, unsettled, rossini, when, barbaia, signed, a, contract, to, take, the, company, to, vienna, rossini, was, glad, to, join, them, but, did, not, reveal, to, barbaia, that, he, had, no, intention, of, returning, to, naples, afterwards, he, travelled, with, colbran, in, march, 1822, breaking, their, journey, at, bologna, where, they, were, married, in, the, presence, of, his, parents, in, a, small, church, in, castenaso, a, few, miles, from, the, city, the, bride, was, thirty, seven, the, groom, thirty, in, vienna, rossini, received, a, hero, s, welcome, his, biographers, describe, it, as, unprecedentedly, feverish, enthusiasm, rossini, fever, and, near, hysteria, the, authoritarian, chancellor, of, the, austrian, empire, metternich, liked, rossini, s, music, and, thought, it, free, of, all, potential, revolutionary, or, republican, associations, he, was, therefore, happy, to, permit, the, san, carlo, company, to, perform, the, composer, s, operas, in, a, three, month, season, they, played, six, of, them, to, audiences, so, enthusiastic, that, beethoven, s, assistant, anton, schindler, described, it, as, an, idolatrous, orgy, while, in, vienna, rossini, heard, beethoven, s, eroica, symphony, and, was, so, moved, that, he, determined, to, meet, the, reclusive, composer, he, finally, managed, to, do, so, and, later, described, the, encounter, to, many, people, including, eduard, hanslick, and, richard, wagner, he, recalled, that, although, conversation, was, hampered, by, beethoven, s, deafness, and, rossini, s, ignorance, of, german, beethoven, made, it, plain, that, he, thought, rossini, s, talents, were, not, for, serious, opera, and, that, above, all, he, should, do, more, barbiere, barbers, after, the, vienna, season, rossini, returned, to, castenaso, to, work, with, his, librettist, gaetano, rossi, on, semiramide, commissioned, by, la, fenice, it, was, premiered, in, february, 1823, his, last, work, for, the, italian, theatre, colbran, starred, but, it, was, clear, to, everyone, that, her, voice, was, in, serious, decline, and, semiramide, ended, her, career, in, italy, the, work, survived, that, one, major, disadvantage, and, entered, the, international, operatic, repertory, remaining, popular, throughout, the, 19th, century, in, richard, osborne, s, words, it, brought, italian, career, to, a, spectacular, close, in, november, 1823, rossini, and, colbran, set, off, for, london, where, a, lucrative, contract, had, been, offered, they, stopped, for, four, weeks, en, route, in, paris, although, he, was, not, as, feverishly, acclaimed, by, the, parisians, as, he, had, been, in, vienna, he, nevertheless, had, an, exceptionally, welcoming, reception, from, the, musical, establishment, and, the, public, when, he, attended, a, performance, of, il, barbiere, at, the, th, tre, italien, he, was, applauded, dragged, onto, the, stage, and, serenaded, by, the, musicians, a, banquet, was, given, for, him, and, his, wife, attended, by, leading, french, composers, and, artists, and, he, found, the, cultural, climate, of, paris, congenial, at, the, end, of, the, year, rossini, arrived, in, london, where, he, was, received, and, made, much, of, by, the, king, george, iv, although, the, composer, was, by, now, unimpressed, by, royalty, and, aristocracy, rossini, and, colbran, had, signed, contracts, for, an, opera, season, at, the, king, s, theatre, in, the, haymarket, her, vocal, shortcomings, were, a, serious, liability, and, she, reluctantly, retired, from, performing, public, opinion, was, not, improved, by, rossini, s, failure, to, provide, a, new, opera, as, promised, the, impresario, vincenzo, benelli, defaulted, on, his, contract, with, the, composer, but, this, was, not, known, to, the, london, press, and, public, who, blamed, rossini, in, a, 2003, biography, of, the, composer, gaia, servadio, comments, that, rossini, and, england, were, not, made, for, each, other, he, was, prostrated, by, the, channel, crossing, and, was, unlikely, to, be, enthused, by, the, english, weather, or, english, cooking, although, his, stay, in, london, was, financially, rewarding, the, british, press, reported, disapprovingly, that, he, had, earned, over, 30, 000, he, was, happy, to, sign, a, contract, at, the, french, embassy, in, london, to, return, to, paris, where, he, had, felt, much, more, at, home, rossini, s, new, and, highly, remunerative, contract, with, the, french, government, was, negotiated, under, louis, xviii, who, died, in, september, 1824, soon, after, rossini, s, arrival, in, paris, it, had, been, agreed, that, the, composer, would, produce, one, grand, opera, for, the, acad, mie, royale, de, musique, and, either, an, opera, buffa, or, an, opera, semiseria, for, the, th, tre, italien, he, was, also, to, help, run, the, latter, theatre, and, revise, one, of, his, earlier, works, for, revival, there, the, death, of, the, king, and, the, accession, of, charles, x, changed, rossini, s, plans, and, his, first, new, work, for, paris, was, il, viaggio, a, reims, an, operatic, entertainment, given, in, june, 1825, to, celebrate, charles, s, coronation, it, was, rossini, s, last, opera, with, an, italian, libretto, he, permitted, only, four, performances, of, the, piece, intending, to, reuse, the, best, of, the, music, in, a, less, ephemeral, opera, about, half, the, score, of, le, comte, ory, 1828, is, from, the, earlier, work, colbran, s, enforced, retirement, put, a, strain, on, the, rossinis, marriage, leaving, her, unoccupied, while, he, continued, to, be, the, centre, of, musical, attention, and, constantly, in, demand, she, consoled, herself, with, what, servadio, describes, as, a, new, pleasure, in, shopping, for, rossini, paris, offered, continual, gourmet, delights, as, his, increasingly, rotund, shape, began, to, reflect, the, first, of, the, four, operas, rossini, wrote, to, french, librettos, were, le, si, ge, de, corinthe, 1826, and, mo, se, et, pharaon, 1827, both, were, substantial, reworkings, of, pieces, written, for, naples, maometto, ii, and, mos, in, egitto, rossini, took, great, care, before, beginning, work, on, the, first, learning, to, speak, french, and, familiarising, himself, with, traditional, french, operatic, ways, of, declaiming, the, language, as, well, as, dropping, some, of, the, original, music, that, was, in, an, ornate, style, unfashionable, in, paris, rossini, accommodated, local, preferences, by, adding, dances, hymn, like, numbers, and, a, greater, role, for, the, chorus, rossini, s, mother, anna, died, in, 1827, he, had, been, devoted, to, her, and, he, felt, her, loss, deeply, she, and, colbran, had, never, got, on, well, and, servadio, suggests, that, after, anna, died, rossini, came, to, resent, the, surviving, woman, in, his, life, in, 1828, rossini, wrote, le, comte, ory, his, only, french, language, comic, opera, his, determination, to, reuse, music, from, il, viaggio, a, reims, caused, problems, for, his, librettists, who, had, to, adapt, their, original, plot, and, write, french, words, to, fit, existing, italian, numbers, but, the, opera, was, a, success, and, was, seen, in, london, within, six, months, of, the, paris, premiere, and, in, new, york, in, 1831, the, following, year, rossini, wrote, his, long, awaited, french, grand, opera, guillaume, tell, based, on, friedrich, schiller, s, 1804, play, which, drew, on, the, william, tell, legend, guillaume, tell, was, well, received, the, orchestra, and, singers, gathered, outside, rossini, s, house, after, the, premiere, and, performed, the, rousing, finale, to, the, second, act, in, his, honour, the, newspaper, le, globe, commented, that, a, new, era, of, music, had, begun, gaetano, donizetti, remarked, that, the, first, and, last, acts, of, the, opera, were, written, by, rossini, but, the, middle, act, was, written, by, god, the, work, was, an, undoubted, success, without, being, a, smash, hit, the, public, took, some, time, in, getting, to, grips, with, it, and, some, singers, found, it, too, demanding, it, nonetheless, was, produced, abroad, within, months, of, the, premiere, and, there, was, no, suspicion, that, it, would, be, the, composer, s, last, opera, jointly, with, semiramide, guillaume, tell, is, rossini, s, longest, opera, at, three, hours, and, forty, five, minutes, and, the, effort, of, composing, it, left, him, exhausted, although, within, a, year, he, was, planning, an, operatic, treatment, of, the, faust, story, events, and, ill, health, overtook, him, after, the, opening, of, guillaume, tell, the, rossinis, had, left, paris, and, were, staying, in, castenaso, within, a, year, events, in, paris, had, rossini, hurrying, back, charles, x, was, overthrown, in, a, revolution, in, july, 1830, and, the, new, administration, headed, by, louis, philippe, i, announced, radical, cutbacks, in, government, spending, among, the, cuts, was, rossini, s, lifetime, annuity, won, after, hard, negotiation, with, the, previous, regime, attempting, to, restore, the, annuity, was, one, of, rossini, s, reasons, for, returning, the, other, was, to, be, with, his, new, mistress, olympe, p, lissier, he, left, colbran, in, castenaso, she, never, returned, to, paris, and, they, never, lived, together, again, the, reasons, for, rossini, s, withdrawal, from, opera, have, been, continually, discussed, during, and, since, his, lifetime, some, have, supposed, that, aged, thirty, seven, and, in, variable, health, having, negotiated, a, sizeable, annuity, from, the, french, government, and, having, written, thirty, nine, operas, he, simply, planned, to, retire, and, kept, to, that, plan, in, a, 1934, study, of, the, composer, the, critic, francis, toye, coined, the, phrase, the, great, renunciation, and, called, rossini, s, retirement, a, phenomenon, unique, in, the, history, of, music, and, difficult, to, parallel, in, the, whole, history, of, art, is, there, any, other, artist, who, thus, deliberately, in, the, very, prime, of, life, renounced, that, form, of, artistic, production, which, had, made, him, famous, throughout, the, civilized, world, the, poet, heine, compared, rossini, s, retirement, with, shakespeare, s, withdrawal, from, writing, two, geniuses, recognising, when, they, had, accomplished, the, unsurpassable, and, not, seeking, to, follow, it, others, then, and, later, suggested, that, rossini, had, retired, because, of, pique, at, the, successes, of, giacomo, meyerbeer, and, fromental, hal, vy, in, the, genre, of, grand, op, ra, modern, rossini, scholarship, has, generally, discounted, such, theories, maintaining, that, rossini, had, no, intention, of, renouncing, operatic, composition, and, that, circumstances, rather, than, personal, choice, made, guillaume, tell, his, last, opera, gossett, and, richard, osborne, suggest, that, illness, may, have, been, a, major, factor, in, rossini, s, retirement, from, about, this, time, rossini, had, intermittent, bad, health, both, physical, and, mental, he, had, contracted, gonorrhoea, in, earlier, years, which, later, led, to, painful, side, effects, from, urethritis, to, arthritis, he, suffered, from, bouts, of, debilitating, depression, which, commentators, have, linked, to, several, possible, causes, cyclothymia, or, bipolar, disorder, or, reaction, to, his, mother, s, death, for, the, next, twenty, five, years, following, guillaume, tell, rossini, composed, little, although, gossett, comments, that, his, comparatively, few, compositions, from, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, show, no, falling, off, in, musical, inspiration, they, include, the, soir, es, musicales, 1830, 1835, a, set, of, twelve, songs, for, solo, or, duet, voices, and, piano, and, his, stabat, mater, begun, in, 1831, and, completed, in, 1841, after, winning, his, fight, with, the, government, over, his, annuity, in, 1835, rossini, left, paris, and, settled, in, bologna, his, return, to, paris, in, 1843, for, medical, treatment, by, jean, civiale, sparked, hopes, that, he, might, produce, a, new, grand, opera, it, was, rumoured, that, eug, ne, scribe, was, preparing, a, libretto, for, him, about, joan, of, arc, the, op, ra, was, moved, to, present, a, french, version, of, otello, in, 1844, which, also, included, material, from, some, of, the, composer, s, earlier, operas, it, is, unclear, to, what, extent, if, at, all, rossini, was, involved, with, this, production, which, was, in, the, event, poorly, received, more, controversial, was, the, pasticcio, opera, of, robert, bruce, 1846, in, which, rossini, by, then, returned, to, bologna, closely, cooperated, by, selecting, music, from, his, past, operas, which, had, not, yet, been, performed, in, paris, notably, la, donna, del, lago, the, op, ra, sought, to, present, robert, as, a, new, rossini, opera, but, although, othello, could, at, least, claim, to, be, genuine, canonic, rossini, the, historian, mark, everist, notes, that, detractors, argued, that, robert, was, simply, fake, goods, and, from, a, bygone, era, at, that, he, cites, th, ophile, gautier, regretting, that, the, lack, of, unity, could, have, been, masked, by, a, superior, performance, unfortunately, the, tradition, of, rossini, s, music, was, lost, at, the, op, ra, a, long, time, ago, the, period, after, 1835, saw, rossini, s, formal, separation, from, his, wife, who, remained, at, castenaso, 1837, and, the, death, of, his, father, at, the, age, of, eighty, 1839, in, 1845, colbran, became, seriously, ill, and, in, september, rossini, travelled, to, visit, her, a, month, later, she, died, the, following, year, rossini, and, p, lissier, were, married, in, bologna, the, events, of, the, year, of, revolution, in, 1848, led, rossini, to, move, away, from, the, bologna, area, where, he, felt, threatened, by, insurrection, and, to, make, florence, his, base, which, it, remained, until, 1855, by, the, early, 1850s, rossini, s, mental, and, physical, health, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, where, his, wife, and, friends, feared, for, his, sanity, or, his, life, by, the, middle, of, the, decade, it, was, clear, that, he, needed, to, return, to, paris, for, the, most, advanced, medical, care, then, available, in, april, 1855, the, rossinis, set, off, for, their, final, journey, from, italy, to, france, rossini, returned, to, paris, aged, sixty, three, and, made, it, his, home, for, the, rest, of, his, life, i, offer, these, modest, songs, to, my, dear, wife, olympe, as, a, simple, testimony, of, gratitude, for, the, affectionate, intelligent, care, which, she, lavished, on, me, during, my, overlong, and, terrible, illness, dedication, of, musique, anodine, 1857, gossett, observes, that, although, an, account, of, rossini, s, life, between, 1830, and, 1855, makes, depressing, reading, it, is, no, exaggeration, to, say, that, in, paris, rossini, returned, to, life, he, recovered, his, health, and, joie, de, vivre, once, settled, in, paris, he, maintained, two, homes, a, flat, in, the, rue, de, la, chauss, e, d, antin, a, smart, central, area, and, a, neo, classical, villa, built, for, him, in, passy, a, commune, now, absorbed, into, the, city, but, then, semi, rural, he, and, his, wife, established, a, salon, that, became, internationally, famous, the, first, of, their, saturday, evening, gatherings, the, samedi, soirs, was, held, in, december, 1858, and, the, last, two, months, before, he, died, in, 1868, rossini, began, composing, again, his, music, from, his, final, decade, was, not, generally, intended, for, public, performance, and, he, did, not, usually, put, dates, of, composition, on, the, manuscripts, consequently, musicologists, have, found, it, difficult, to, give, definite, dates, for, his, late, works, but, the, first, or, among, the, first, was, the, song, cycle, musique, anodine, dedicated, to, his, wife, and, presented, to, her, in, april, 1857, for, their, weekly, salons, he, produced, more, than, 150, pieces, including, songs, solo, piano, pieces, and, chamber, works, for, many, different, combinations, of, instruments, he, referred, to, them, as, his, p, ch, s, de, vieillesse, sins, of, old, age, the, salons, were, held, both, at, beau, s, jour, the, passy, villa, and, in, the, winter, at, the, paris, flat, such, gatherings, were, a, regular, feature, of, parisian, life, the, writer, james, penrose, has, observed, that, the, well, connected, could, easily, attend, different, salons, almost, every, night, of, the, week, but, the, rossinis, samedi, soirs, quickly, became, the, most, sought, after, an, invitation, was, the, city, s, highest, social, prize, the, music, carefully, chosen, by, rossini, was, not, only, his, own, but, included, works, by, pergolesi, haydn, and, mozart, and, modern, pieces, by, some, of, his, guests, among, the, composers, who, attended, the, salons, and, sometimes, performed, were, auber, gounod, liszt, rubinstein, meyerbeer, and, verdi, rossini, liked, to, call, himself, a, fourth, class, pianist, but, the, many, famous, pianists, who, attended, the, samedi, soirs, were, dazzled, by, his, playing, violinists, such, as, pablo, sarasate, and, joseph, joachim, and, the, leading, singers, of, the, day, were, regular, guests, in, 1860, wagner, visited, rossini, via, an, introduction, from, rossini, s, friend, edmond, michotte, who, some, forty, five, years, later, wrote, his, account, of, the, genial, conversation, between, the, two, composers, one, of, rossini, s, few, late, works, intended, to, be, given, in, public, was, his, petite, messe, solennelle, first, performed, in, 1864, in, the, same, year, rossini, was, made, a, grand, officer, of, the, legion, of, honour, by, napoleon, iii, after, a, short, illness, and, an, unsuccessful, operation, to, treat, colorectal, cancer, rossini, died, at, passy, on, 13, november, 1868, at, the, age, of, seventy, six, he, left, olympe, a, life, interest, in, his, estate, which, after, her, death, ten, years, later, passed, to, the, commune, of, pesaro, for, the, establishment, of, a, liceo, musicale, and, funded, a, home, for, retired, opera, singers, in, paris, after, a, funeral, service, attended, by, more, than, four, thousand, people, at, the, church, of, sainte, trinit, paris, rossini, s, body, was, interred, at, the, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, 1887, his, remains, were, moved, to, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, florence, tous, les, genres, sont, bons, hors, le, genre, ennuyeux, rossini, in, a, letter, of, 1868, citing, voltaire, the, writer, julian, budden, noting, the, formulas, adopted, early, on, by, rossini, in, his, career, and, consistently, followed, by, him, thereafter, as, regards, overtures, arias, structures, and, ensembles, has, called, them, the, code, rossini, in, a, reference, to, the, code, napol, on, the, legal, system, established, by, the, french, emperor, rossini, s, overall, style, may, indeed, have, been, influenced, more, directly, by, the, french, the, historian, john, rosselli, suggests, that, french, rule, in, italy, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, meant, that, music, had, taken, on, new, military, qualities, of, attack, noise, and, speed, to, be, heard, in, rossini, rossini, s, approach, to, opera, was, inevitably, tempered, by, changing, tastes, and, audience, demands, the, formal, classicist, libretti, of, metastasio, which, had, underpinned, late, 18th, century, opera, seria, were, replaced, by, subjects, more, to, the, taste, of, the, age, of, romanticism, with, stories, demanding, stronger, characterisation, and, quicker, action, a, jobbing, composer, needed, to, meet, these, demands, or, fail, rossini, s, strategies, met, this, reality, a, formulaic, approach, was, logistically, indispensable, for, rossini, s, career, at, least, at, the, start, in, the, seven, years, 1812, 1819, he, wrote, 27, operas, often, at, extremely, short, notice, for, la, cenerentola, 1817, for, example, he, had, just, over, three, weeks, to, write, the, music, before, the, premi, re, such, pressures, led, to, a, further, significant, element, of, rossini, s, compositional, procedures, not, included, in, budden, s, code, namely, recycling, the, composer, often, transferred, a, successful, overture, to, subsequent, operas, thus, the, overture, to, la, pietra, del, paragone, was, later, used, for, the, opera, seria, tancredi, 1813, and, in, the, other, direction, the, overture, to, aureliano, in, palmira, 1813, ended, as, and, is, today, known, as, the, overture, to, the, comedy, il, barbiere, di, siviglia, the, barber, of, seville, he, also, liberally, re, employed, arias, and, other, sequences, in, later, works, spike, hughes, notes, that, of, the, twenty, six, numbers, of, eduardo, e, cristina, produced, in, venice, in, 1817, nineteen, were, lifted, from, previous, works, the, audience, were, remarkably, good, humoured, and, asked, slyly, why, the, libretto, had, been, changed, since, the, last, performance, rossini, expressed, his, disgust, when, the, publisher, giovanni, ricordi, issued, a, complete, edition, of, his, works, in, the, 1850s, the, same, pieces, will, be, found, several, times, for, i, thought, i, had, the, right, to, remove, from, my, fiascos, those, pieces, which, seemed, best, to, rescue, them, from, shipwreck, a, fiasco, seemed, to, be, good, and, dead, and, now, look, they, ve, resuscitated, them, all, philip, gossett, notes, that, rossini, was, from, the, outset, a, consummate, composer, of, overtures, his, basic, formula, for, these, remained, constant, throughout, his, career, gossett, characterises, them, as, sonata, movements, without, development, sections, usually, preceded, by, a, slow, introduction, with, clear, melodies, exuberant, rhythms, simple, harmonic, structure, and, a, crescendo, climax, richard, taruskin, also, notes, that, the, second, theme, is, always, announced, in, a, woodwind, solo, whose, catchiness, etch, a, distinct, profile, in, the, aural, memory, and, that, the, richness, and, inventiveness, of, his, handling, of, the, orchestra, even, in, these, early, works, marks, the, start, of, he, great, nineteenth, century, flowering, of, orchestration, rossini, s, handling, of, arias, and, duets, in, cavatina, style, marked, a, development, from, the, eighteenth, century, commonplace, of, recitative, and, aria, in, the, words, of, rosselli, in, rossini, s, hands, the, aria, became, an, engine, for, releasing, emotion, rossini, s, typical, aria, structure, involved, a, lyrical, introduction, cantabile, and, a, more, intensive, brilliant, conclusion, cabaletta, this, model, could, be, adapted, in, various, ways, so, as, to, forward, the, plot, as, opposed, to, the, typical, eighteenth, century, handling, which, resulted, in, the, action, coming, to, a, halt, as, the, requisite, repeats, of, the, da, capo, aria, were, undertaken, for, example, they, could, be, punctuated, by, comments, from, other, characters, a, convention, known, as, pertichini, or, the, chorus, could, intervene, between, the, cantabile, and, the, cabaletta, so, as, to, fire, up, the, soloist, if, such, developments, were, not, necessarily, rossini, s, own, invention, he, nevertheless, made, them, his, own, by, his, expert, handling, of, them, a, landmark, in, this, context, is, the, cavatina, di, tanti, palpiti, from, tancredi, which, both, taruskin, and, gossett, amongst, others, single, out, as, transformative, the, most, famous, aria, rossini, ever, wrote, with, a, melody, that, seems, to, capture, the, melodic, beauty, and, innocence, characteristic, of, italian, opera, both, writers, point, out, the, typical, rossinian, touch, of, avoiding, an, expected, cadence, in, the, aria, by, a, sudden, shift, from, the, home, key, of, f, to, that, of, a, flat, see, example, taruskin, notes, the, implicit, pun, as, the, words, talk, of, returning, but, the, music, moves, in, a, new, direction, the, influence, was, lasting, gossett, notes, how, the, rossinian, cabaletta, style, continued, to, inform, italian, opera, as, late, as, giuseppe, verdi, s, aida, 1871, such, structural, integration, of, the, forms, of, vocal, music, with, the, dramatic, development, of, the, opera, meant, a, sea, change, from, the, metastasian, primacy, of, the, aria, in, rossini, s, works, solo, arias, progressively, take, up, a, smaller, proportion, of, the, operas, in, favour, of, duets, also, typically, in, cantabile, caballetta, format, and, ensembles, during, the, late, 18th, century, creators, of, opera, buffa, had, increasingly, developed, dramatic, integration, of, the, finales, of, each, act, finales, began, to, spread, backwards, taking, an, ever, larger, proportion, of, the, act, taking, the, structure, of, a, musically, continuous, chain, accompanied, throughout, by, orchestra, of, a, series, of, sections, each, with, its, own, characteristics, of, speed, and, style, mounting, to, a, clamorous, and, vigorous, final, scene, in, his, comic, operas, rossini, brought, this, technique, to, its, peak, and, extended, its, range, far, beyond, his, predecessors, of, the, finale, to, the, first, act, of, l, italiana, in, algeri, taruskin, writes, that, unning, through, almost, a, hundred, pages, of, vocal, score, in, record, time, it, is, the, most, concentrated, single, dose, of, rossini, that, there, is, of, greater, consequence, for, the, history, of, opera, was, rossini, s, ability, to, progress, this, technique, in, the, genre, of, opera, seria, gossett, in, a, very, detailed, analysis, of, the, first, act, finale, of, tancredi, identifies, several, elements, in, rossini, s, practice, these, include, the, contrast, of, kinetic, action, sequences, often, characterised, by, orchestral, motifs, with, static, expressions, of, emotion, the, final, static, section, in, the, form, of, a, caballetta, with, all, the, characters, joining, in, the, final, cadences, gossett, claims, that, it, is, from, the, time, of, tancredi, that, the, caballetta, becomes, the, obligatory, closing, section, of, each, musical, unit, in, the, operas, of, rossini, and, his, contemporaries, with, extremely, few, exceptions, all, rossini, s, compositions, before, the, p, ch, s, de, vieillesse, of, his, retirement, involve, the, human, voice, his, very, first, surviving, work, apart, from, a, single, song, is, however, a, set, of, string, sonatas, for, two, violins, cello, and, double, bass, written, at, the, age, of, 12, when, he, had, barely, begun, instruction, in, composition, tuneful, and, engaging, they, indicate, how, remote, the, talented, child, was, from, the, influence, of, the, advances, in, musical, form, evolved, by, mozart, haydn, and, beethoven, the, accent, is, on, cantabile, melody, colour, variation, and, virtuosity, rather, than, transformational, development, these, qualities, are, also, evident, in, rossini, s, early, operas, especially, his, farse, one, act, farces, rather, than, his, more, formal, opere, serie, gossett, notes, that, these, early, works, were, written, at, a, time, when, he, deposited, mantles, of, cimarosa, and, paisiello, were, unfilled, these, were, rossini, s, first, and, increasingly, appreciated, steps, in, trying, them, on, the, teatro, san, mois, in, venice, where, his, farse, was, first, performed, and, the, la, scala, theatre, of, milan, which, premiered, his, two, act, opera, la, pietra, del, paragone, 1812, were, seeking, works, in, that, tradition, gossett, notes, that, in, these, operas, rossini, s, musical, personality, began, to, take, shape, many, elements, emerge, that, remain, throughout, his, career, including, love, of, sheer, sound, of, sharp, and, effective, rhythms, the, unusual, effect, employed, in, the, overture, of, il, signor, bruschino, 1813, deploying, violin, bows, tapping, rhythms, on, music, stands, is, an, example, of, such, witty, originality, the, great, success, in, venice, of, the, premieres, of, both, tancredi, and, the, comic, opera, l, italiana, in, algeri, within, a, few, weeks, of, each, other, 6, february, 1813, and, 22, may, 1813, respectively, set, the, seal, on, rossini, s, reputation, as, the, rising, opera, composer, of, his, generation, from, the, end, of, 1813, to, mid, 1814, he, was, in, milan, creating, two, new, operas, for, la, scala, aureliano, in, palmira, and, il, turco, in, italia, arsace, in, aureliano, was, sung, by, the, castrato, giambattista, velluti, this, was, the, last, opera, role, rossini, wrote, for, a, castrato, singer, as, the, norm, became, to, use, contralto, voices, another, sign, of, change, in, operatic, taste, rumour, had, it, that, rossini, was, displeased, by, velluti, s, ornamentation, of, his, music, but, in, fact, throughout, his, italian, period, up, to, semiramide, 1823, rossini, s, written, vocal, lines, become, increasingly, florid, and, this, is, more, appropriately, credited, to, the, composer, s, own, changing, style, rossini, s, work, in, naples, contributed, to, this, stylistic, development, the, city, which, was, the, cradle, of, the, operas, of, cimarosa, and, paisiello, had, been, slow, to, acknowledge, the, composer, from, pesaro, but, domenico, barbaia, invited, him, in, 1815, on, a, seven, year, contract, to, manage, his, theatres, and, compose, operas, for, the, first, time, rossini, was, able, to, work, over, a, long, period, with, a, company, of, musicians, and, singers, including, amongst, the, latter, isabella, colbran, andrea, nozzari, giovanni, david, and, others, who, as, gossett, notes, all, specialized, in, florid, singing, and, whose, vocal, talents, left, an, indelible, and, not, wholly, positive, mark, on, rossini, s, style, rossini, s, first, operas, for, naples, elisabetta, regina, d, inghilterra, and, la, gazzetta, were, both, largely, recycled, from, earlier, works, but, otello, 1816, is, marked, not, only, by, its, virtuoso, vocal, lines, but, by, its, masterfully, integrated, last, act, with, its, drama, underlined, by, melody, orchestration, and, tonal, colour, here, in, gossett, s, opinion, rossini, came, of, age, as, a, dramatic, artist, he, further, comments, the, growth, of, rossini, s, style, from, elisabetta, regina, d, inghilterra, to, zelmira, and, ultimately, semiramide, is, a, direct, consequence, of, th, continuity, not, only, did, rossini, compose, some, of, his, finest, operas, for, naples, but, these, operas, profoundly, affected, operatic, composition, in, italy, and, made, possible, the, developments, that, were, to, lead, to, verdi, by, now, rossini, s, career, was, arousing, interest, across, europe, others, came, to, italy, to, study, the, revival, of, italian, opera, and, used, its, lessons, to, advance, themselves, amongst, these, was, the, berlin, born, giacomo, meyerbeer, who, arrived, in, italy, in, 1816, a, year, after, rossini, s, establishment, at, naples, and, lived, and, worked, there, until, following, him, to, paris, in, 1825, he, used, one, of, rossini, s, librettists, gaetano, rossi, for, five, of, his, seven, italian, operas, which, were, produced, at, turin, venice, and, milan, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, of, september, 1818, he, includes, a, detailed, critique, of, otello, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, non, italian, informed, observer, he, is, scathing, about, the, self, borrowings, in, the, first, two, acts, but, concedes, that, the, third, act, so, firmly, established, rossini, s, reputation, in, venice, that, even, a, thousand, follies, could, not, rob, him, of, it, but, this, act, is, divinely, beautiful, and, what, is, so, strange, is, that, beauties, are, blatantly, un, rossinian, outstanding, even, passionate, recitatives, mysterious, accompaniments, lots, of, local, colour, rossini, s, contract, did, not, prevent, him, from, undertaking, other, commissions, and, before, otello, il, barbiere, di, siviglia, a, grand, culmination, of, the, opera, buffa, tradition, had, been, premiered, in, rome, february, 1816, richard, osborne, catalogues, its, excellencies, beyond, the, physical, impact, of, figaro, s, largo, al, factotum, there, is, rossini, s, ear, for, vocal, and, instrumental, timbres, of, a, peculiar, astringency, and, brilliance, his, quick, witted, word, setting, and, his, mastery, of, large, musical, forms, with, their, often, brilliant, and, explosive, internal, variations, add, to, that, what, verdi, called, the, opera, s, abundance, of, true, musical, ideas, and, the, reasons, for, the, work, s, longer, term, emergence, as, rossini, s, most, popular, opera, buffa, are, not, hard, to, find, apart, from, la, cenerentola, rome, 1817, and, the, pen, and, ink, sketch, farsa, adina, 1818, not, performed, until, 1826, rossini, s, other, works, during, his, contract, with, naples, were, all, in, the, opera, seria, tradition, amongst, the, most, notable, of, these, all, containing, virtuoso, singing, roles, were, mos, in, egitto, 1818, la, donna, del, lago, 1819, maometto, ii, 1820, all, staged, in, naples, and, semiramide, his, last, opera, written, for, italy, staged, at, la, fenice, in, venice, in, 1823, the, three, versions, of, the, opera, semiseria, matilde, di, shabran, were, written, in, 1821, 1822, both, mos, and, maometto, ii, were, later, to, undergo, significant, reconstruction, in, paris, see, below, already, in, 1818, meyerbeer, had, heard, rumours, that, rossini, was, seeking, a, lucrative, appointment, at, the, paris, opera, should, be, accepted, he, will, go, to, the, french, capital, and, we, will, perhaps, experience, curious, things, some, six, years, were, to, pass, before, this, prophecy, came, true, in, 1824, rossini, under, a, contract, with, the, french, government, became, director, of, the, th, tre, italien, in, paris, where, he, introduced, meyerbeer, s, opera, il, crociato, in, egitto, and, for, which, he, wrote, il, viaggio, a, reims, to, celebrate, the, coronation, of, charles, x, 1825, this, was, his, last, opera, to, an, italian, libretto, and, was, later, cannibalised, to, create, his, first, french, opera, le, comte, ory, 1828, a, new, contract, in, 1826, meant, he, could, concentrate, on, productions, at, the, op, ra, and, to, this, end, he, substantially, revised, maometto, ii, as, le, si, ge, de, corinthe, 1826, and, mos, as, mo, se, et, pharaon, 1827, meeting, french, taste, the, works, are, extended, each, by, one, act, the, vocal, lines, in, the, revisions, are, less, florid, and, the, dramatic, structure, is, enhanced, with, the, proportion, of, arias, reduced, one, of, the, most, striking, additions, was, the, chorus, at, the, end, of, act, iii, of, mo, se, with, a, crescendo, repetition, of, a, diatonic, ascending, bass, line, rising, first, by, a, minor, third, then, by, a, major, third, at, each, appearance, and, a, descending, chromatic, top, line, which, roused, the, excitement, of, audiences, rossini, s, government, contract, required, him, to, create, at, least, one, new, grand, op, ra, and, rossini, settled, on, the, story, of, william, tell, working, closely, with, the, librettist, tienne, de, jouy, the, story, in, particular, enabled, him, to, indulge, an, underlying, interest, in, the, related, genres, of, folk, music, pastoral, and, the, picturesque, this, becomes, clear, from, the, overture, which, is, explicitly, programmatic, in, describing, weather, scenery, and, action, and, presents, a, version, of, the, ranz, des, vaches, the, swiss, cowherd, s, call, which, undergoes, a, number, of, transformations, during, the, opera, and, gives, it, in, richard, osborne, s, opinion, something, of, the, character, of, a, leitmotif, in, the, opinion, of, the, music, historian, benjamin, walton, rossini, saturate, the, work, with, local, colour, to, such, a, degree, that, there, is, room, for, little, else, thus, the, role, of, the, soloists, is, significantly, reduced, compared, to, other, rossini, operas, the, hero, not, even, having, an, aria, of, his, own, whilst, the, chorus, of, the, swiss, people, is, consistently, in, the, musical, and, dramatic, foregrounds, guillaume, tell, premiered, in, august, 1829, rossini, also, provided, for, the, op, ra, a, shorter, three, act, version, which, incorporated, the, pas, redoubl, quick, march, final, section, of, the, overture, in, its, finale, it, was, first, performed, in, 1831, and, became, the, basis, of, the, op, ra, s, future, productions, tell, was, very, successful, from, the, start, and, was, frequently, revived, in, 1868, the, composer, was, present, at, its, 500th, performance, at, the, op, ra, the, globe, had, reported, enthusiastically, at, its, opening, that, a, new, epoch, has, opened, not, only, for, french, opera, but, for, dramatic, music, elsewhere, this, was, an, era, it, transpired, in, which, rossini, was, not, to, participate, rossini, s, contract, required, him, to, provide, five, new, works, for, the, op, ra, over, 10, years, after, the, premi, re, of, tell, he, was, already, considering, some, opera, subjects, including, goethe, s, faust, but, the, only, significant, works, he, completed, before, abandoning, paris, in, 1836, were, the, stabat, mater, written, for, a, private, commission, in, 1831, later, completed, and, published, in, 1841, and, the, collection, of, salon, vocal, music, soir, es, musicales, published, in, 1835, living, in, bologna, he, occupied, himself, teaching, singing, at, the, liceo, musicale, and, also, created, a, pasticcio, of, tell, rodolfo, di, sterlinga, for, the, benefit, of, the, singer, nicola, ivanoff, for, which, giuseppe, verdi, provided, some, new, arias, continuing, demand, in, paris, resulted, in, the, production, of, a, new, french, version, of, otello, in, 1844, with, which, rossini, was, not, involved, and, a, new, opera, robert, bruce, for, which, rossini, cooperated, with, louis, niedermeyer, and, others, to, recast, music, for, la, donna, del, lago, and, others, of, his, works, which, were, little, known, in, paris, to, fit, a, new, libretto, the, success, of, both, of, these, was, qualified, to, say, the, least, not, until, rossini, returned, to, paris, in, 1855, were, there, signs, of, a, revival, of, his, musical, spirits, a, stream, of, pieces, for, voices, choir, piano, and, chamber, ensembles, written, for, his, soir, es, the, p, ch, s, de, vieillesse, sins, of, old, age, were, issued, in, thirteen, volumes, from, 1857, to, 1868, of, these, volumes, 4, to, 8, comprise, 56, semi, comical, piano, pieces, dedicated, to, pianists, of, the, fourth, class, to, which, i, have, the, honour, of, belonging, these, include, a, mock, funeral, march, marche, et, reminiscences, pour, mon, dernier, voyage, march, and, reminiscences, for, my, last, journey, gossett, writes, of, the, p, ch, s, their, historical, position, remains, to, be, assessed, but, it, seems, likely, that, their, effect, direct, or, indirect, on, composers, like, camille, saint, sa, ns, and, erik, satie, was, significant, the, most, substantial, work, of, rossini, s, last, decade, the, petite, messe, solennelle, 1863, was, written, for, small, forces, originally, voices, two, pianos, and, harmonium, and, therefore, unsuited, to, concert, hall, performance, and, as, it, included, women, s, voices, it, was, unacceptable, for, church, performances, at, the, time, for, these, reasons, richard, osborne, suggests, the, piece, has, been, somewhat, overlooked, among, rossini, s, compositions, it, is, neither, especially, petite, little, nor, entirely, solennelle, solemn, but, is, notable, for, its, grace, counterpoint, and, melody, at, the, end, of, the, manuscript, the, composer, wrote, dear, god, here, it, is, finished, this, poor, little, mass, is, it, sacred, music, i, have, written, or, damned, music, i, was, born, for, opera, buffa, as, you, know, well, a, little, technique, a, little, heart, that, s, all, be, blessed, then, and, grant, me, paradise, the, popularity, of, rossini, s, melodies, led, many, contemporary, virtuosi, to, create, piano, transcriptions, or, fantasies, based, on, them, examples, include, sigismond, thalberg, s, fantasy, on, themes, from, mo, se, the, sets, of, variations, on, non, pi, mesta, from, la, cenerentola, by, henri, herz, fr, d, ric, chopin, franz, h, nten, anton, diabelli, and, friedrich, burgm, ller, and, liszt, s, transcriptions, of, the, william, tell, overture, 1838, and, the, soir, es, musicales, the, continuing, popularity, of, his, comic, operas, and, the, decline, in, staging, his, opere, serie, the, overthrow, of, the, singing, and, staging, styles, of, his, period, and, the, emerging, concept, of, the, composer, as, a, creative, artist, rather, than, a, craftsman, diminished, and, distorted, rossini, s, place, in, music, history, even, though, the, forms, of, italian, opera, continued, up, to, the, period, of, verismo, to, be, indebted, to, his, innovations, rossini, s, status, amongst, his, contemporary, italian, composers, is, indicated, by, the, messa, per, rossini, a, project, initiated, by, verdi, within, a, few, days, of, rossini, s, death, which, he, and, a, dozen, other, composers, created, in, collaboration, if, rossini, s, principal, legacy, to, italian, opera, was, in, vocal, forms, and, dramatic, structure, for, serious, opera, his, legacy, to, french, opera, was, to, provide, a, bridge, from, opera, buffa, to, the, development, of, op, ra, comique, and, thence, via, jacques, offenbach, s, op, ras, bouffes, to, the, genre, of, operetta, op, ras, comiques, showing, a, debt, to, rossini, s, style, include, fran, ois, adrien, boieldieu, s, la, dame, blanche, 1825, and, daniel, auber, s, fra, diavolo, 1830, as, well, as, works, by, ferdinand, h, rold, adolphe, adam, and, fromental, hal, vy, critical, of, rossini, s, style, was, hector, berlioz, who, wrote, of, his, melodic, cynicism, his, contempt, for, dramatic, and, good, sense, his, endless, repetition, of, a, single, form, of, cadence, his, eternal, puerile, crescendo, and, his, brutal, bass, drum, it, was, perhaps, inevitable, that, the, formidable, reputation, which, rossini, had, built, in, his, lifetime, would, fade, thereafter, in, 1886, less, than, twenty, years, after, the, composer, s, death, bernard, shaw, wrote, the, once, universal, rossini, whose, semiramide, appeared, to, our, greener, grandfathers, a, ninevesque, wonder, came, at, last, to, be, no, longer, looked, upon, as, a, serious, musician, in, an, 1877, review, of, il, barbiere, he, noted, that, adelina, patti, sang, as, an, encore, in, the, lesson, scene, home, sweet, home, but, that, the, opera, proved, so, intolerably, wearisome, that, some, of, her, audience, had, already, displayed, their, appreciation, of, the, sentiment, of, the, ballad, in, the, most, practical, way, in, the, early, 20th, century, rossini, received, tributes, from, both, ottorino, respighi, who, had, orchestrated, excerpts, from, the, p, ch, s, de, viellesse, both, in, his, ballet, la, boutique, fantasque, 1918, and, in, his, 1925, suite, rossiniana, and, from, benjamin, britten, who, adapted, music, by, rossini, for, two, suites, soir, es, musicales, op, 9, in, 1937, and, matin, es, musicales, op, 24, in, 1941, richard, osborne, singles, out, the, three, volume, biography, of, rossini, by, giuseppe, radiciotti, 1927, 1929, as, an, important, turning, point, towards, positive, appreciation, which, may, also, have, been, assisted, by, the, trend, of, neoclassicism, in, music, a, firm, re, evaluation, of, rossini, s, significance, began, only, later, in, the, 20th, century, in, the, light, of, study, and, the, creation, of, critical, editions, of, his, works, a, prime, mover, in, these, developments, was, the, fondazione, g, rossini, which, was, created, by, the, city, of, pesaro, in, 1940, using, the, funds, which, had, been, left, to, the, city, by, the, composer, since, 1980, the, fondazione, has, supported, the, annual, rossini, opera, festival, in, pesaro, in,
