standards, by, the, time, zhou, began, attending, it, had, adopted, the, educational, model, used, at, the, phillips, academy, in, the, united, states, the, school, s, reputation, with, its, highly, disciplined, daily, routine, and, strict, moral, code, attracted, many, students, who, later, became, prominent, in, public, life, zhou, s, friends, and, classmates, there, ranged, from, ma, jun, an, early, communist, leader, executed, in, 1927, to, k, c, wu, later, mayor, of, shanghai, and, governor, of, taiwan, under, the, nationalist, party, zhou, s, talents, also, attracted, the, attention, of, yan, xiu, and, zhang, boling, yan, in, particular, thought, highly, of, zhou, helping, to, pay, for, his, studies, in, japan, and, later, france, yan, was, so, impressed, with, zhou, that, he, encouraged, zhou, to, marry, his, daughter, but, zhou, declined, zhou, later, expressed, the, reasons, for, his, decision, not, to, marry, yan, s, daughter, to, his, classmate, zhang, honghao, zhou, said, that, he, declined, the, marriage, because, he, feared, that, his, financial, prospects, would, not, be, promising, and, that, yan, would, as, his, father, in, law, later, dominate, his, life, zhou, did, well, in, his, studies, at, nankai, he, excelled, in, chinese, won, several, awards, in, the, school, speech, club, and, became, editor, of, the, school, newspaper, in, his, final, year, zhou, was, also, very, active, in, acting, and, producing, dramas, and, plays, at, nankai, many, students, who, were, not, otherwise, acquainted, with, him, knew, of, him, through, his, acting, nankai, preserves, a, number, of, essays, and, articles, written, by, zhou, at, this, time, and, these, reflect, the, discipline, training, and, concern, for, country, that, nankai, s, founders, attempted, to, instill, in, their, students, at, the, school, s, tenth, commencement, in, june, 1917, zhou, was, one, of, five, graduating, students, honored, at, the, ceremony, and, one, of, the, two, valedictorians, by, the, time, that, he, graduated, from, nankai, zhang, boling, s, teachings, of, gong, public, spirit, and, neng, ability, had, made, a, great, impression, on, him, his, participation, in, debates, and, stage, performances, contributed, to, his, eloquence, and, skills, of, persuasion, zhou, left, nankai, with, a, great, desire, to, pursue, public, service, and, to, acquire, the, skills, required, to, do, so, following, many, of, his, classmates, zhou, went, to, japan, in, july, 1917, for, further, studies, during, his, two, years, in, japan, zhou, spent, most, of, his, time, in, the, east, asian, higher, preparatory, school, a, language, school, for, chinese, students, zhou, s, studies, were, supported, by, his, uncles, and, apparently, nankai, founder, yan, xiu, as, well, but, their, funds, were, limited, during, this, period, japan, suffered, from, severe, inflation, zhou, originally, planned, to, win, one, of, the, scholarships, offered, by, the, chinese, government, these, scholarships, however, required, chinese, students, to, pass, entrance, examinations, in, japanese, universities, zhou, took, entrance, examinations, for, at, least, two, schools, but, failed, to, gain, admission, zhou, s, reported, anxieties, were, compounded, by, the, death, of, his, uncle, zhou, yikui, his, inability, to, master, japanese, and, the, acute, japanese, cultural, chauvinism, that, discriminated, against, chinese, by, the, time, that, zhou, returned, to, china, in, the, spring, of, 1919, he, had, become, deeply, disenchanted, with, japanese, culture, rejecting, the, idea, that, the, japanese, political, model, was, relevant, to, china, and, disdaining, the, values, of, elitism, and, militarism, that, he, observed, zhou, s, diaries, and, letters, from, his, time, in, tokyo, show, a, deep, interest, in, politics, and, current, events, in, particular, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, and, the, bolsheviks, new, policies, he, began, to, read, avidly, chen, duxiu, s, progressive, and, left, leaning, magazine, new, youth, he, read, early, japanese, works, on, marx, and, it, has, been, claimed, that, he, even, attended, kawakami, hajime, s, lectures, at, kyoto, university, kawakami, was, an, important, figure, in, the, early, history, of, japanese, marxism, and, his, translations, and, articles, influenced, a, generation, of, chinese, communists, however, it, now, seems, unlikely, that, zhou, met, him, or, heard, any, of, his, lectures, zhou, s, diaries, also, show, his, interest, in, chinese, student, protests, in, opposition, to, the, sino, japanese, joint, defense, agreement, in, may, 1918, but, he, did, not, actively, participate, in, them, or, return, to, china, as, part, of, the, returning, home, movement, his, active, role, in, political, movements, began, after, his, return, to, china, zhou, returned, to, tianjin, sometime, in, the, spring, of, 1919, historians, disagree, over, his, participation, in, the, may, fourth, movement, may, to, june, 1919, zhou, s, official, chinese, biography, states, that, he, was, a, leader, of, the, tianjin, student, protests, in, the, may, fourth, movement, but, many, modern, scholars, believe, that, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, zhou, participated, at, all, based, on, the, total, lack, of, direct, evidence, among, the, surviving, records, from, the, period, in, july, 1919, however, zhou, became, editor, of, the, tianjin, student, union, bulletin, apparently, at, the, request, of, his, nankai, classmate, ma, jun, a, founder, of, the, union, during, its, brief, existence, from, july, 1919, to, early, 1920, the, bulletin, was, widely, read, by, student, groups, around, the, country, and, suppressed, on, at, least, one, occasion, by, the, national, government, as, harmful, to, public, safety, and, social, order, when, nankai, became, a, university, in, august, 1919, zhou, was, in, the, first, class, but, was, an, activist, full, time, his, political, activities, continued, to, expand, and, in, september, he, and, several, other, students, agreed, to, establish, the, awakening, society, a, small, group, never, numbering, more, than, 25, in, explaining, the, goals, and, purpose, of, the, awakening, society, zhou, declared, that, anything, that, is, incompatible, with, progress, in, current, times, such, as, militarism, the, bourgeoisie, partylords, bureaucrats, inequality, between, men, and, women, obstinate, ideas, obsolete, morals, old, ethics, should, be, abolished, or, reformed, and, affirmed, that, it, was, the, purpose, of, the, society, to, spread, this, awareness, among, the, chinese, people, it, was, in, this, society, that, zhou, first, met, his, future, wife, deng, yingchao, in, some, ways, the, awakening, society, resembled, the, clandestine, marxist, study, group, at, peking, university, headed, by, li, dazhao, with, the, group, members, using, numbers, instead, of, names, for, secrecy, zhou, was, number, five, a, pseudonym, which, he, continued, to, use, in, later, years, indeed, immediately, after, the, group, was, established, it, invited, li, dazhao, to, give, a, lecture, on, marxism, zhou, assumed, a, more, prominent, active, role, in, political, activities, over, the, next, few, months, the, largest, of, these, activities, were, rallies, in, support, of, a, nationwide, boycott, of, japanese, goods, as, the, boycott, became, more, effective, the, national, government, under, pressure, from, japan, attempted, to, suppress, it, on, 23, january, 1920, a, confrontation, over, boycott, activities, in, tianjin, led, to, the, arrest, of, a, number, of, people, including, several, awakening, society, members, and, on, 29, january, zhou, led, a, march, on, the, governor, s, office, in, tianjin, to, present, a, petition, calling, for, the, arrestees, release, zhou, and, three, other, leaders, were, themselves, arrested, the, arrestees, were, held, for, over, six, months, during, their, detention, zhou, supposedly, organized, discussions, on, marxism, at, their, trial, in, july, zhou, and, six, others, were, sentenced, to, two, months, the, rest, were, found, not, guilty, all, were, immediately, released, since, they, had, already, been, held, over, six, months, after, zhou, s, release, he, and, the, awakening, society, met, with, several, beijing, organizations, and, agreed, to, form, a, reform, federation, during, these, activities, zhou, became, more, familiar, with, li, dazhao, and, met, zhang, shenfu, who, was, the, contact, between, li, in, beijing, and, chen, duxiu, in, shanghai, both, men, were, organizing, underground, communist, cells, in, cooperation, with, grigori, voitinsky, a, comintern, agent, but, zhou, apparently, did, not, meet, voitinsky, at, this, point, soon, after, his, release, zhou, decided, to, go, to, europe, to, study, he, was, expelled, from, nankai, university, during, his, detention, although, money, was, a, problem, he, received, a, scholarship, from, yan, xiu, in, order, to, gain, greater, funding, he, successfully, approached, a, tianjin, newspaper, yishi, bao, literally, current, events, newspaper, for, work, as, a, special, correspondent, in, europe, zhou, left, shanghai, for, europe, on, 7, november, 1920, with, a, group, of, 196, work, study, students, including, friends, from, nankai, and, tianjin, zhou, s, experiences, after, the, may, fourth, incident, seem, to, have, been, crucial, to, his, communist, career, zhou, s, friends, in, the, awakening, society, were, similarly, affected, 15, of, the, group, s, members, became, communists, for, at, least, some, time, and, the, group, remained, close, later, on, zhou, and, six, other, group, members, travelled, to, europe, in, the, next, two, years, and, zhou, eventually, married, deng, yingchao, the, group, s, youngest, member, zhou, s, group, arrived, in, marseille, on, 13, december, 1920, unlike, most, other, chinese, students, who, went, to, europe, on, work, study, programs, zhou, s, scholarship, and, position, with, yishi, bao, meant, that, he, was, well, provided, for, and, did, not, have, to, do, any, work, during, his, stay, because, of, his, financial, position, he, was, able, to, devote, himself, full, time, to, revolutionary, activities, in, a, letter, to, his, cousin, on, 30, january, 1921, zhou, said, that, his, goals, in, europe, were, to, survey, the, social, conditions, in, foreign, countries, and, their, methods, of, resolving, social, issues, in, order, to, apply, such, lessons, in, china, after, his, return, in, the, same, letter, zhou, told, his, cousin, that, regarding, his, adoption, of, a, specific, ideology, i, still, have, to, make, up, my, mind, while, in, europe, zhou, also, named, as, john, knight, studied, the, differing, approaches, to, resolving, class, conflict, adopted, by, various, european, nations, in, london, in, january, 1921, zhou, witnessed, a, large, miners, strike, and, wrote, a, series, of, articles, for, the, yishi, bao, generally, sympathetic, to, the, miners, examining, the, conflict, between, workers, and, employers, and, the, conflict, s, resolution, after, five, weeks, in, london, he, moved, to, paris, where, interest, in, russia, s, 1917, october, revolution, was, high, in, a, letter, to, his, cousin, zhou, identified, two, broad, paths, of, reform, for, china, gradual, reform, as, in, england, or, violent, means, as, in, russia, zhou, wrote, that, i, do, not, have, a, preference, for, either, the, russian, or, the, british, way, i, would, prefer, something, in, between, rather, than, one, of, these, two, extremes, still, interested, in, academic, programs, zhou, traveled, to, britain, in, january, 1921, to, visit, edinburgh, university, concerned, by, financial, problems, and, language, requirements, he, did, not, enroll, returning, to, france, at, the, end, of, january, there, are, no, records, of, zhou, entering, any, academic, program, in, france, in, spring, 1921, he, joined, a, chinese, communist, cell, zhou, was, recruited, by, zhang, shenfu, whom, he, had, met, in, august, of, the, previous, year, in, connection, with, li, dazhao, he, also, knew, zhang, through, zhang, s, wife, liu, qingyang, a, member, of, the, awakening, society, zhou, has, sometimes, been, portrayed, at, this, time, as, uncertain, in, his, politics, but, his, swift, move, to, communism, suggests, otherwise, the, cell, zhou, belonged, to, was, based, in, paris, in, addition, to, zhou, zhang, and, liu, it, included, two, other, students, zhao, shiyan, and, chen, gongpei, over, the, next, several, months, this, group, eventually, formed, a, united, organization, with, a, group, of, chinese, radicals, from, hunan, who, were, living, in, montargis, south, of, paris, this, group, included, such, later, prominent, figures, as, cai, hesen, li, lisan, chen, yi, nie, rongzhen, deng, xiaoping, and, also, guo, longzhen, another, member, of, the, awakening, society, unlike, zhou, most, of, the, students, in, this, group, were, participants, in, the, work, study, program, a, series, of, conflicts, with, the, chinese, administrators, of, the, program, over, low, pay, and, poor, working, conditions, resulted, in, over, a, hundred, students, occupying, the, program, s, offices, at, the, sino, french, institute, in, lyon, in, september, 1921, the, students, including, several, people, from, the, montargis, group, were, arrested, and, deported, zhou, was, apparently, not, one, of, the, occupying, students, and, remained, in, france, until, february, or, march, 1922, when, he, moved, with, zhang, and, liu, from, paris, to, berlin, zhou, s, move, to, berlin, was, perhaps, because, the, relatively, lenient, political, atmosphere, in, berlin, made, it, more, favorable, as, a, base, for, overall, european, organizing, in, addition, the, western, european, secretariat, of, the, comintern, was, located, in, berlin, and, it, is, clear, that, zhou, had, important, comintern, connections, though, the, nature, of, these, is, disputed, after, moving, operations, to, germany, zhou, regularly, shuttled, between, paris, and, berlin, zhou, participated, in, the, diligent, work, frugal, study, movement, 37, zhou, returned, to, paris, by, june, 1922, where, he, was, one, of, the,

for, focusing, on, the, narrow, persecution, of, anti, maoists, as, anti, bolsheviks, exaggerating, the, threat, to, the, party, and, condemning, the, use, of, torture, as, an, investigative, technique, zhou, s, resolution, was, passed, and, adopted, on, 7, january, 1932, and, the, campaign, gradually, subsided, zhou, moved, to, the, jiangxi, base, area, and, shook, up, the, propaganda,

zhou, although, personally, opposed, to, them, directed, these, following, their, subsequent, defeat, he, and, other, military, leaders, were, blamed, although, zhou, s, subsequently, cautious, military, approach, was, distrusted, by, hardliners, he, was, again, appointed, to, the, position, of, vice, chairman, of, the, military, commission, zhou, was, accepted, as, leader, largely, because, of, his, organizational, talent, and, devotion, to, work, and, because, he, had, never, shown, any, overt, ambition, to, pursue, supreme, power, within, the, party, within, months, the, continuing, orthodox, tactics, of, bo, and, braun, led, to, a, serious, defeat, for, the, red, army, and, forced, the, leaders, of, the, ccp, to, seriously, consider, abandoning, their, bases, in, jiangxi, after, the, decision, to, abandon, jiangxi, was, announced, zhou, was, placed, in, charge, of, organizing, and, supervising, the, logistics, of, the, communist, withdrawal, making, his, plans, in, absolute,

casualties, as, possible, and, before, chiang, s, forces, were, able, to, completely, occupy, all, communist, bases, it, is, not, known, what, criteria, were, used, to, determine, who, would, stay, and, who, would, go, but, 16, 000, troops, and, some, of, the, communists, most, notable, commanders, at, the, time, including, xiang, ying, chen, yi, tan, zhenlin, and, qu, qiubai, were, left, to, form, a, rear, guard, to, divert, the, main, force, of, nationalist, troops, from, noticing, the, communists, general, withdrawal, the, withdrawal, of, 84, 000, soldiers, and, civilians, began, in,

passage, with, general, chen, who, subsequently, allowed, the, red, army, to, pass, through, the, territory, that, he, controlled, without, fighting, after, passing, through, three, of, the, four, blockhouse, fortifications, needed, to, escape, chiang, s, encirclement, the, red, army, was, finally, intercepted, by, regular, nationalist, troops, and, suffered, heavy, casualties, of, the, 86, 000, communists, who, attempted, to, break, out, of, jiangxi, only, 36, 000, successfully, escaped, this, loss, demoralized, some, communist, leaders, particularly, bo, gu, and, otto, braun, but, zhou, remained, calm, and, retained, his, command, during, the, communists, subsequent, long, march, there, were, numerous, high, level, disputes, over, the, direction, that, the, communists, should, take, and, on, the, causes, of, the, red, army, s, defeats, during, the, power, struggles, that, ensued, zhou, consistently, backed, mao, zedong, against, the, interests, of, bo, gu, and, otto, braun, bo, and, braun, were, later, blamed, for, the, red, army, s, defeats, and, were, eventually, removed, from, their, positions, of, leadership, the, communists, eventually, succeeded, in, re, establishing, a, base, in, northern, shaanxi, on, 20, october, 1935, arriving, with, only, 8, 000, 9, 000, remaining, members, zhou, s, position, within, the, ccp, changed, numerous, times,

when, sharing, power, with, bo, and, braun, in, the, months, following, the, january, 1935, zunyi, conference, in, which, bo, and, braun, were, removed, from, senior, positions, zhou, mostly, retained, his, position, because, he, displayed, a, willingness, to, display, responsibility, because, his, tactics, in, defeating, chiang, s, fourth, encirclement, campaign, were, recognized, as, being, successful, and, because, he, supported, mao, zedong, who, was, gaining, influence, inside, the, party, after, the, zunyi, conference, mao, became, zhou, s, assistant, after, the, communists, reached, shaanxi, and, completed, the, long, march, mao, officially, took, over, zhou, enlai, s, leading, position, in, the, ccp, while, zhou, took, a, secondary, position, as, vice, chairman, mao,

the, country, and, fighting, the, japanese, but, warned, that, chiang, was, firmly, in, control, of, the, national, government, and, that, these, goals, would, be, difficult, to, pursue, without, chiang, s, cooperation, both, parties, ended, their, meeting, with, an, agreement, to, find, a, way, to, secretly, work, together, at, the, same, time, that, zhou, was, establishing, secret, contacts, with, zhang, chiang, was, growing, suspicious, of, zhang, and, became, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, zhang, s, inaction, against, the, communists, in, order, to, deceive, chiang, zhou, and, zhang,

opportunity, to, have, chiang, killed, others, including, zhou, enlai, and, zhang, wentian, saw, it, as, an, opportunity, to, achieve, a, united, front, policy, against, the, japanese, which, would, strengthen, the, overall, position, of, the, ccp, debate, within, yan, an, ended, when, a, long, telegram, from, joseph, stalin, arrived, urging, the, ccp, to, work, towards, chiang, s, release, explaining, that, a, united, front, was, the, best, position, from, which, to, resist, the, japanese, and, that, only, chiang, had, the, prestige, and, authority, to, carry, out, such, a, plan, after,

make, a, brief, appearance, at, zhou, s, funeral, instructing, his, nephew, mao, yuanxin, to, explain, that, he, could, not, attend, because, doing, so, would, be, seen, as, a, public, admission, that, he, was, being, forced, to, rethink, the, cultural, revolution, as, zhou, s, later, years, had, been, closely, associated, with, reversing, and, moderating, its, excesses, mao, worried, that,

hometown, rather, than, stored, in, a, ceremonial, mausoleum, with, zhou, gone, it, became, clear, how, the, chinese, people, had, revered, him, and, how, they, had, viewed, him, as, a, symbol, of, stability, in, an, otherwise, chaotic, period, of, history, zhou, s, death, also, brought, condolences, from, nations, around, the, world, vice, premier, deng, xiaoping, delivered, the, eulogy, at, zhou, s, state, funeral, on, 15, january, 1976, although, much, of, his, speech, echoed, the, wording, of, an, official, statement, by, the, central, committee, immediately, following, zhou, s, death, or, consisted, of, a, meticulous, description, of, zhou, s, remarkable, political, career, near, the, end, of, the, eulogy, he, offered, a, personal, tribute, to, zhou, s, character, speaking, from, the, heart, while, observing, the, rhetoric, demanded, of, ceremonial, state, occasions, referring, to, zhou, deng, stated, that, he, was, open, and, aboveboard, paid, attention, to, the, interests, of, the, whole, observed, party, discipline, was, strict, in, dissecting, himself, and, good, at, uniting, the, mass, of, cadres, and, upheld, the, unity, and, solidarity, of, the, party, he, maintained, broad, and, close, ties, with, the, masses, and, showed, boundless, warmheartedness, towards, all, comrades, and, the, people, we, should, learn, from, his, fine, style, being, modest, and, prudent, unassuming, and, approachable, setting, an, example, by, his, conduct, and, living, in, a, plain, and, hard, working, way, we, should, follow, his, example, of, adhering, to, the, proletarian, style, and, opposing, the, bourgeois, style, of, life, spence, believed, this, statement, was, interpreted, at, the, time, as, a, subtle, criticism, of, mao, and, the, other, leaders, of, the, cultural, revolution, who, could, not, possibly, be, viewed, or, praised, as, being, open, and, aboveboard, good, at, uniting, the, mass, of, cadres, for, displaying, warmheartedness, or, for, modesty, prudence, or, approachability, regardless, of, deng, s, intentions, the, gang, of, four, and, later, hua, guofeng, increased, the, persecution, of, deng, shortly, after, he, delivered, this, eulogy, after, zhou, s, single, official, memorial, ceremony, on, 15, january, zhou, s, political, enemies, within, the, party, officially, prohibited, any, further, displays, of, public, mourning, the, most, notorious, regulations, prohibiting, zhou, from, being, honored, were, the, poorly, observed, and, poorly, enforced, five, nos, no, wearing, black, armbands, no, mourning, wreaths, no, mourning, halls, no, memorial, activities, and, no, handing, out, photos, of, zhou, years, of, resentment, over, the, cultural, revolution, the, public, persecution, of, deng, xiaoping, who, was, strongly, associated, with, zhou, in, public, perception, and, the, prohibition, against, publicly, mourning, zhou, became, associated, with, each, other, shortly, after, zhou, s, death, leading, to, popular, discontent, against, mao, and, his, apparent, successors, notably, hua, guofeng, and, the, gang, of, four, official, attempts, to, enforce, the, five, nos, included, removing, public, memorials, and, tearing, down, posters, commemorating, his, achievements, on, 25, march, 1976, a, leading, shanghai, newspaper, wenhui, bao, published, an, article, stating, that, zhou, was, the, capitalist, roader, inside, the, party, wanted, to, help, the, unrepentant, capitalist, roader, regain, his, power, this, and, other, propaganda, efforts, to, attack, zhou, s, image, only, strengthened, the, public, s, attachment, to, zhou, s, memory, between, march, and, april, 1976, a, forged, document, circulated, in, nanjing, that, claimed, itself, to, be, zhou, enlai, s, last, will, it, attacked, jiang, qing, and, praised, deng, xiaoping, and, was, met, with, increased, propaganda, efforts, by, the, government, within, several, months, after, the, death, of, zhou, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, spontaneous, events, in, the, history, of, the, prc, occurred, on, 4, april, 1976, at, the, eve, of, china, s, annual, qingming, festival, in, which, chinese, traditionally, pay, homage, to, their, deceased, ancestors, thousands, of, people, gathered, around, the, monument, to, the, people, s, heroes, in, tiananmen, square, to, commemorate, the, life, and, death, of, zhou, enlai, on, this, occasion, the, people, of, beijing, honored, zhou, by, laying, wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and, flowers, at, the, foot, of, the, monument, the, most, obvious, purpose, of, this, memorial, was, to, eulogize, zhou, but, jiang, qing, zhang, chunqiao, and, yao, wenyuan, were, also, attacked, for, their, alleged, evil, actions, against, the, premier, a, small, number, of, slogans, left, at, tiananmen, even, attacked, mao, himself, and, his, cultural, revolution, up, to, two, million, people, may, have, visited, tiananmen, square, on, 4, april, first, hand, observations, of, the, events, in, tiananmen, square, on, 4, april, report, that, all, levels, of, society, from, the, poorest, peasants, to, high, ranking, pla, officers, and, the, children, of, high, ranking, cadres, were, represented, in, the, activities, those, who, participated, were, motivated, by, a, mixture, of, anger, over, the, treatment, of, zhou, revolt, against, mao, and, his, policies, apprehension, for, china, s, future, and, defiance, of, those, who, would, seek, to, punish, the, public, for, commemorating, zhou, s, memory, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, that, events, were, coordinated, from, any, position, of, leadership, it, was, a, spontaneous, demonstration, reflecting, widespread, public, sentiment, deng, xiaoping, was, notably, absent, and, he, instructed, his, children, to, avoid, being, seen, at, the, square, on, the, morning, of, 5, april, crowds, gathering, around, the, memorial, arrived, to, discover, that, it, had, been, completely, removed, by, the, police, during, the, night, angering, them, attempts, to, suppress, the, mourners, led, to, a, violent, riot, in, which, police, cars, were, set, on, fire, and, a, crowd, of, over, 100, 000, people, forced, its, way, into, several, government, buildings, surrounding, the, square, by, 6, 00, pm, most, of, the, crowd, had, dispersed, but, a, small, group, remained, until, 10, 00, pm, when, a, security, force, entered, tiananmen, square, and, arrested, them, the, reported, figure, of, those, arrested, was, 388, people, but, was, rumored, to, be, far, higher, many, of, those, arrested, were, later, sentenced, to, people, s, trial, at, peking, university, or, were, sentenced, to, prison, work, camps, incidents, similar, to, those, which, occurred, in, beijing, on, 4, and, 5, april, occurred, in, zhengzhou, kunming, taiyuan, changchun, shanghai, wuhan, and, guangzhou, possibly, because, of, his, close, association, with, zhou, deng, xiaoping, was, formally, stripped, of, all, positions, inside, and, outside, the, party, on, 7, april, following, this, tiananmen, incident, after, ousting, hua, guofeng, and, assuming, control, of, china, in, 1980, deng, xiaoping, released, those, arrested, in, the, tiananmen, incident, as, part, of, a, broader, effort, to, reverse, the, effects, of, the, cultural, revolution, by, the, end, of, his, lifetime, zhou, was, widely, viewed, as, representing, moderation, and, justice, in, chinese, popular, culture, since, his, death, zhou, enlai, has, been, regarded, as, a, skilled, negotiator, fluent, in, foreign, languages, a, master, of, policy, implementation, a, devoted, revolutionary, and, a, pragmatic, statesman, with, an, unusual, attentiveness, to, detail, and, nuance, he, was, also, known, for, his, tireless, and, dedicated, work, ethic, and, his, unusual, charm, and, poise, in, public, he, was, reputedly, the, last, mandarin, bureaucrat, in, the, confucian, tradition, zhou, s, political, behavior, should, be, viewed, in, light, of, his, political, philosophy, as, well, as, his, personality, to, a, large, extent, zhou, epitomized, the, paradox, inherent, in, a, communist, politician, with, traditional, chinese, upbringing, at, once, conservative, and, radical, pragmatic, and, ideological, possessed, of, a, belief, in, order, and, harmony, as, well, as, a, faith, which, he, developed, very, gradually, over, time, in, the, progressive, power, of, rebellion, and, revolution, though, a, firm, believer, in, the, communist, ideal, on, which, the, people, s, republic, was, founded, zhou, is, widely, credited, to, have, moderated, the, excesses, of, mao, s, radical, policies, within, the, limits, of, his, power, it, has, been, assumed, that, he, successfully, protected, several, imperial, and, religious, sites, of, cultural, significance, such, as, the, potala, palace, in, lhasa, and, forbidden, city, in, beijing, from, the, red, guards, and, shielded, many, top, level, leaders, including, deng, xiaoping, as, well, as, many, officials, academics, and, artists, from, purges, deng, xiaoping, was, quoted, as, saying, zhou, was, sometimes, forced, to, act, against, his, conscience, in, order, to, minimize, the, damage, stemming, from, mao, s, policies, while, many, earlier, chinese, leaders, today, have, been, subjected, to, criticism, inside, china, zhou, s, image, has, remained, positive, and, respected, among, contemporary, chinese, many, chinese, continue, to, venerate, zhou, as, possibly, the, most, humane, leader, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, cpc, today, promotes, zhou, as, a, dedicated, and, self, sacrificing, leader, who, remains, a, symbol, of, the, communist, party, even, historians, who, list, mao, s, faults, generally, attribute, the, opposite, qualities, to, zhou, zhou, was, cultured, and, educated, whereas, mao, was, crude, and, simple, zhou, was, consistent, whereas, mao, was, unstable, zhou, was, stoic, whereas, mao, was, paranoid, following, the, death, of, mao, chinese, press, emphasized, in, particular, his, consultative, logical, realistic, and, cool, headed, leadership, style, however, recent, academic, criticism, of, zhou, has, focused, on, his, late, relationship, with, mao, and, his, political, activities, during, the, cultural, revolution, arguing, that, the, relationship, between, zhou, and, mao, may, have, been, more, complex, than, is, commonly, portrayed, zhou, has, been, depicted, as, unconditionally, submissive, and, extremely, loyal, to, mao, and, his, allies, going, out, of, his, way, to, support, or, permit, the, persecution, of, friends, and, relatives, in, order, to, avoid, facing, political, condemnation, himself, after, the, founding, of, the, prc, zhou, was, unable, or, unwilling, to, protect, the, former, spies, that, he, had, employed, in, the, chinese, civil, war, and, the, second, world, war, who, were, persecuted, for, their, wartime, contacts, with, the, enemies, of, the, ccp, early, in, the, cultural, revolution, he, told, jiang, qing, from, now, on, you, make, all, the, decisions, and, i, ll, make, sure, they, re, carried, out, and, publicly, declared, that, his, old, comrade, liu, shaoqi, deserved, to, die, for, opposing, mao, in, the, effort, to, avoid, being, persecuted, for, opposing, mao, zhou, passively, accepted, the, political, persecution, of, many, others, including, his, own, brother, a, popular, saying, within, china, once, compared, zhou, to, a, budaoweng, a, tumbler, which, can, imply, that, he, was, a, political, opportunist, li, zhisui, then, one, of, mao, s, personal, physicians, characterized, zhou, as, such, and, was, severely, critical, of, zhou, in, his, book, the, private, life, of, chairman, mao, describing, him, as, mao, s, slave, absolutely, obsequiously, obedient, everything, he, did, he, did, to, be, loyal, to, mao, neither, he, nor, had, a, shred, of, independent, thought, li, also, described, mao, s, contradictory, relationship, with, zhou, as, one, where, he, demanded, total, loyalty, but, because, zhou, was, so, subservient, and, loyal, mao, held, in, contempt, some, observers, have, criticized, him, as, being, too, diplomatic, avoiding, clear, stands, in, complex, political, situations, and, instead, becoming, ideologically, elusive, ambiguous, and, enigmatic, several, explanations, have, been, offered, to, explain, his, elusiveness, dick, wilson, the, former, chief, editor, of, the, far, eastern, economic, review, writes, that, zhou, s, only, option, was, to, go, on, pretending, to, support, the, movement, while, endeavoring, to, deflect, its, successes, blunt, its, mischief, and, stanch, the, wounds, it, was, inflicting, this, explanation, for, zhou, s, elusiveness, was, also, widely, accepted, by, many, chinese, after, his, death, wilson, also, writes, that, zhou, would, have, been, hounded, out, of, his, position, of, influence, removed, from, control, of, the, government, were, he, to, make, a, stand, and, demand, that, mao, call, off, the, campaign, or, bring, the, red, guards, to, heel, zhou, s, involvement, in, the, cultural, revolution, is, thus, defended, by, many, on, the, grounds, that, he, had, no, choice, other, than, political, martyrdom, due, to, his, influence, and, political, ability, the, entire, government, may, have, collapsed, without, his, cooperation, given, the, political, circumstances, of, the, last, decade, of, zhou, s, life, it, is, unlikely, that, he, would, have, survived, a, purge, without, cultivating, the, support, of, mao, through, active, assistance, zhou, received, a, great, deal, of, praise, from, american, statesmen, who, met, him, in, 1971, henry, kissinger, wrote, that, he, had, been, extremely, impressed, with, zhou, s, intelligence, and, character, describing, him, as, equally, at, home, in, philosophy, reminiscence, historical, analysis, tactical, probes, humorous, repartee, could, display, an, extraordinary, personal, graciousness, kissinger, called, zhou, one, of, the, two, or, three, most, impressive, men, i, have, ever, met, stating, that, his, commands, of, facts, in, particular, his, knowledge, of, american, events, and, for, that, matter, of, my, own, background, was, stunning, in, his, memoirs, richard, nixon, stated, that, he, was, impressed, with, zhou, s, exceptional, brilliance, and, dynamism, mao, dominated, any, gathering, zhou, suffused, it, mao, s, passion, strove, to, overwhelm, opposition, zhou, s, intellect, would, seek, to, persuade, or, outmaneuver, it, mao, was, sardonic, zhou, penetrating, mao, thought, of, himself, as, a, philosopher, zhou, saw, his, role, as, an, administrator, or, a, negotiator, mao, was, eager, to, accelerate, history, zhou, was, content, to, exploit, its, currents, former, u, s, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, on, china, 2011, after, coming, to, power, deng, xiaoping, may, have, overemphasized, zhou, enlai, s, achievements, to, distance, the, communist, party, from, mao, s, great, leap, forward, and, cultural, revolution, both, of, which, had, seriously, weakened, the, party, s, prestige, deng, observed, that, mao, s, disastrous, policies, could, no, longer, represent, the, party, s, finest, hour, but, that, the, legacy, and, character, of, zhou, enlai, could, furthermore, deng, received, credit, for, enacting, successful, economic, policies, that, zhou, initially, proposed, by, actively, associating, itself, with, an, already, popular, zhou, enlai, zhou, s, legacy, may, have, been, used, and, possibly, distorted, as, a, political, tool, of, the, party, after, his, death, zhou, remains, a, widely, commemorated, figure, in, china, today, after, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, zhou, ordered, his, hometown, of, huai, an, not, to, transform, his, house, into, a, memorial, and, not, to, keep, up, the, zhou, family, tombs, these, orders, were, respected, within, zhou, s, lifetime, but, today, his, family, home, and, traditional, family, school, have, been, restored, and, are, visited, by, a, large, number, of, tourists, every, year,
