route, of, de, soto, s, expedition, in, north, america, a, controversial, process, over, the, years, local, politicians, vied, to, have, their, localities, associated, with, the, expedition, the, most, widely, used, version, of, de, soto, s, trail, comes, from, a, study, commissioned, by, the, united, states, congress, a, committee, chaired, by, the, anthropologist, john, r, swanton, published, the, final, report, of, the, united, states, de, soto, expedition, commission, in, 1939, among, other, locations, manatee, county, florida, claims, an, approximate, landing, site, for, de, soto, and, has, a, national, memorial, recognizing, that, event, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, first, part, of, the, expedition, s, course, up, to, de, soto, s, battle, at, mabila, a, small, fortress, town, in, present, day, central, alabama, is, disputed, only, in, minor, details, his, route, beyond, mabila, is, contested, swanton, reported, the, de, soto, trail, ran, from, there, through, mississippi, arkansas, and, texas, historians, have, more, recently, considered, archeological, reconstructions, and, the, oral, history, of, the, various, native, american, peoples, who, recount, the, expedition, most, historical, places, have, been, overbuilt, and, much, evidence, has, been, lost, more, than, 450, years, have, passed, between, the, events, and, current, history, tellers, but, some, oral, histories, have, been, found, to, be, accurate, about, historic, events, that, have, been, otherwise, documented, the, governor, martin, site, at, the, former, apalachee, village, of, anhaica, located, about, a, mile, east, of, the, present, florida, capital, in, tallahassee, has, been, documented, as, definitively, associated, with, de, soto, s, expedition, the, governor, martin, site, was, discovered, by, archaeologist, b, calvin, jones, in, march, 1987, it, has, been, preserved, as, the, desoto, site, historic, state, park, the, hutto, martin, site, 8mr3447, in, southeastern, marion, county, florida, on, the, ocklawaha, river, is, the, most, likely, site, of, the, principal, town, of, acuera, referred, to, in, the, accounts, of, the, entrada, as, well, as, the, site, of, the, seventeenth, century, mission, of, santa, lucia, de, acuera, as, of, 2016, the, richardson, uf, village, site, 8al100, in, alachua, county, west, of, orange, lake, appears, to, have, been, accepted, by, archaeologists, as, the, site, of, the, town, of, potano, visited, by, the, de, soto, expedition, the, 17th, century, mission, of, san, buenaventura, de, potano, is, believed, to, have, been, founded, here, many, archaeologists, believe, the, parkin, archeological, state, park, in, northeast, arkansas, was, the, main, town, for, the, indigenous, province, of, casqui, which, de, soto, had, recorded, they, base, this, on, similarities, between, descriptions, from, the, journals, of, the, de, soto, expedition, and, artifacts, of, european, origin, discovered, at, the, site, in, the, 1960s, theories, of, de, soto, s, route, are, based, on, the, accounts, of, four, chroniclers, of, the, expedition, milanich, and, hudson, warn, that, older, translations, of, the, chronicles, are, often, relatively, free, translations, in, which, the, translators, took, considerable, liberty, with, the, spanish, and, portuguese, text, the, chronicles, describe, de, soto, s, trail, in, relation, to, havana, from, which, they, sailed, the, gulf, of, mexico, which, they, skirted, while, traveling, inland, then, turned, back, to, later, the, atlantic, ocean, which, they, approached, during, their, second, year, high, mountains, which, they, traversed, immediately, thereafter, and, dozens, of, other, geographic, features, along, their, way, such, as, large, rivers, and, swamps, at, recorded, intervals, given, that, the, natural, geography, has, not, changed, much, since, de, soto, s, time, scholars, have, analyzed, those, journals, with, modern, topographic, intelligence, to, develop, a, more, precise, account, of, the, de, soto, trail, in, may, 1539, de, soto, landed, nine, ships, with, over, 620, men, and, 220, horses, in, an, area, generally, identified, as, south, tampa, bay, historian, robert, s, weddle, has, suggested, that, he, landed, at, either, charlotte, harbor, or, san, carlos, bay, he, named, the, land, as, esp, ritu, santo, after, the, holy, spirit, the, ships, carried, priests, craftsmen, engineers, farmers, and, merchants, some, with, their, families, some, from, cuba, most, from, europe, and, africa, few, of, the, men, had, traveled, before, outside, of, spain, or, even, away, from, their, home, villages, near, de, soto, s, port, the, party, found, juan, ortiz, a, spaniard, living, with, the, mocoso, people, ortiz, had, been, captured, by, the, uzita, while, searching, for, the, lost, narv, ez, expedition, he, later, escaped, to, mocoso, ortiz, had, learned, the, timucua, language, and, served, as, an, interpreter, to, de, soto, as, he, traversed, the, timucuan, speaking, areas, on, his, way, to, apalachee, ortiz, developed, a, method, for, guiding, the, expedition, and, communicating, with, the, various, tribes, who, spoke, many, dialects, and, languages, he, recruited, guides, from, each, tribe, along, the, route, a, chain, of, communication, was, established, whereby, a, guide, who, had, lived, in, close, proximity, to, another, tribal, area, was, able, to, pass, his, information, and, language, on, to, a, guide, from, a, neighboring, area, because, ortiz, refused, to, dress, as, a, hidalgo, spaniard, other, officers, questioned, his, motives, de, soto, remained, loyal, to, ortiz, allowing, him, the, freedom, to, dress, and, live, among, his, native, friends, another, important, guide, was, the, seventeen, year, old, boy, perico, or, pedro, from, what, is, now, georgia, he, spoke, several, of, the, local, tribes, languages, and, could, communicate, with, ortiz, perico, was, taken, as, a, guide, in, 1540, the, spanish, had, also, captured, other, indians, whom, they, used, as, slave, labor, perico, was, treated, better, due, to, his, value, to, the, spaniards, the, expedition, traveled, north, exploring, florida, s, west, coast, and, encountering, native, ambushes, and, conflicts, along, the, way, hernando, de, soto, s, army, seized, the, food, stored, in, the, villages, captured, women, to, be, used, as, slaves, for, the, soldiers, sexual, gratification, and, forced, men, and, boys, to, serve, as, guides, and, bearers, the, army, fought, two, battles, with, timucua, groups, resulting, in, heavy, timucua, casualties, after, defeating, the, resisting, timucuan, warriors, hernando, de, soto, had, 200, executed, in, what, was, to, be, called, the, napituca, massacre, the, first, large, scale, massacre, by, europeans, in, the, current, united, states, de, soto, s, first, winter, encampment, was, at, anhaica, the, capital, of, the, apalachee, people, it, is, one, of, the, few, places, on, the, route, where, archaeologists, have, found, physical, traces, of, the, expedition, the, chroniclers, described, this, settlement, as, being, near, the, bay, of, horses, the, bay, was, named, for, events, of, the, 1527, narv, ez, expedition, the, members, of, which, dying, of, starvation, killed, and, ate, their, horses, while, building, boats, for, escape, by, the, gulf, of, mexico, from, their, winter, location, in, the, western, panhandle, of, florida, having, heard, of, gold, being, mined, toward, the, sun, s, rising, the, expedition, turned, northeast, through, what, is, now, the, modern, state, of, georgia, based, on, archaeological, finds, made, in, 2009, at, a, remote, privately, owned, site, near, the, ocmulgee, river, researchers, believe, that, de, soto, s, expedition, stopped, in, telfair, county, artifacts, found, here, include, nine, glass, trade, beads, some, of, which, bear, a, chevron, pattern, made, in, venice, for, a, limited, period, of, time, and, believed, to, be, indicative, of, the, de, soto, expedition, six, metal, objects, were, also, found, including, a, silver, pendant, and, some, iron, tools, the, rarest, items, were, found, within, what, researchers, believe, was, a, large, council, house, of, the, indigenous, people, whom, de, soto, was, visiting, the, expedition, continued, to, present, day, south, carolina, there, the, expedition, recorded, being, received, by, a, female, chief, cofitachequi, who, gave, her, tribe, s, pearls, food, and, other, goods, to, the, spanish, soldiers, the, expedition, found, no, gold, however, other, than, pieces, from, an, earlier, coastal, expedition, presumably, that, of, lucas, v, zquez, de, ayll, n, de, soto, headed, north, into, the, appalachian, mountains, of, present, day, western, north, carolina, where, he, spent, a, month, resting, the, horses, while, his, men, searched, for, gold, de, soto, next, entered, eastern, tennessee, at, this, point, de, soto, either, continued, along, the, tennessee, river, to, enter, alabama, from, the, north, according, to, john, r, swanton, or, turned, south, and, entered, northern, georgia, according, to, charles, m, hudson, swanton, s, final, report, published, by, the, smithsonian, remains, an, important, resource, but, hudson, s, reconstruction, of, the, route, was, conducted, 40, years, later, and, benefited, from, considerable, advances, in, archaeological, methods, de, soto, s, expedition, spent, another, month, in, the, coosa, chiefdom, a, vassal, to, tuskaloosa, who, was, the, paramount, chief, believed, to, have, been, connected, to, the, large, and, complex, mississippian, culture, which, extended, throughout, the, mississippi, valley, and, its, tributaries, de, soto, turned, south, toward, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, meet, two, ships, bearing, fresh, supplies, from, havana, de, soto, demanded, women, and, servants, and, when, tuskaloosa, refused, the, european, explorers, took, him, hostage, the, expedition, began, making, plans, to, leave, the, next, day, and, tuskaloosa, gave, in, to, de, soto, s, demands, providing, bearers, for, the, spaniards, he, informed, de, soto, that, they, would, have, to, go, to, his, town, of, mabila, or, mauvila, a, fortified, city, in, southern, alabama, to, receive, the, women, de, soto, gave, the, chief, a, pair, of, boots, and, a, red, cloak, to, reward, him, for, his, cooperation, the, mobilian, tribe, under, chief, tuskaloosa, ambushed, de, soto, s, army, other, sources, suggest, de, soto, s, men, were, attacked, after, attempting, to, force, their, way, into, a, cabin, occupied, by, tuskaloosa, the, spaniards, fought, their, way, out, and, retaliated, by, burning, the, town, to, the, ground, during, the, nine, hour, encounter, about, 200, spaniards, died, and, 150, more, were, badly, wounded, according, to, the, chronicler, elvas, twenty, more, died, during, the, next, few, weeks, they, killed, an, estimated, 2, 000, 6, 000, native, americans, at, mabila, making, the, battle, one, of, the, bloodiest, in, recorded, north, american, history, the, spaniards, won, a, pyrrhic, victory, as, they, had, lost, most, of, their, possessions, and, nearly, one, quarter, of, their, horses, the, spaniards, were, wounded, and, sickened, surrounded, by, enemies, and, without, equipment, in, an, unknown, territory, fearing, that, word, of, this, would, reach, spain, if, his, men, reached, the, ships, at, mobile, bay, de, soto, led, them, away, from, the, gulf, coast, he, moved, into, inland, mississippi, most, likely, near, present, day, tupelo, where, they, spent, the, winter, in, the, spring, of, 1541, de, soto, demanded, 200, men, as, porters, from, the, chickasaw, they, refused, his, demand, and, attacked, the, spanish, camp, during, the, night, on, 8, may, 1541, de, soto, s, troops, reached, the, mississippi, river, de, soto, had, little, interest, in, the, river, which, in, his, view, was, an, obstacle, to, his, mission, there, has, been, considerable, research, into, the, exact, location, where, de, soto, crossed, the, mississippi, river, a, commission, appointed, by, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, 1935, determined, that, sunflower, landing, mississippi, was, the, most, likely, crossing, place, de, soto, possibly, traveled, down, charley, s, trace, which, had, been, used, as, a, trail, through, the, swamps, of, the, mississippi, delta, to, reach, the, mississippi, river, de, soto, and, his, men, spent, a, month, building, flatboats, and, crossed, the, river, at, night, to, avoid, the, native, americans, who, were, patrolling, the, river, de, soto, had, hostile, relations, with, the, native, people, in, this, area, in, the, late, 20th, century, research, suggests, other, locations, may, have, been, the, site, of, de, soto, s, crossing, including, three, locations, in, mississippi, commerce, friars, point, and, walls, as, well, as, memphis, tennessee, once, across, the, river, the, expedition, continued, traveling, westward, through, modern, day, arkansas, oklahoma, and, texas, they, wintered, in, autiamique, on, the, arkansas, river, after, a, harsh, winter, the, spanish, expedition, decamped, and, moved, on, more, erratically, their, interpreter, juan, ortiz, had, died, making, it, more, difficult, for, them, to, get, directions, and, food, sources, and, generally, to, communicate, with, the, natives, the, expedition, went, as, far, inland, as, the, caddo, river, where, they, clashed, with, a, native, american, tribe, called, the, tula, in, october, 1541, the, spaniards, characterized, them, as, the, most, skilled, and, dangerous, warriors, they, had, encountered, this, may, have, happened, in, the, area, of, present, day, caddo, gap, arkansas, a, monument, to, the, de, soto, expedition, was, erected, in, that, community, eventually, the, spaniards, returned, to, the, mississippi, river, de, soto, died, of, a, fever, on, 21, may, 1542, in, the, native, village, of, guachoya, historical, sources, disagree, as, to, whether, de, soto, died, near, present, day, lake, village, arkansas, mcarthur, arkansas, or, ferriday, louisiana, louisiana, erected, a, historical, marker, at, the, estimated, site, on, the, western, bank, of, the, mississippi, river, before, his, death, de, soto, chose, luis, de, moscoso, alvarado, his, former, maestro, de, campo, or, field, commander, to, assume, command, of, the, expedition, at, the, time, of, death, de, soto, owned, four, indian, slaves, three, horses, and, 700, hogs, de, soto, had, deceived, the, local, natives, into, believing, that, he, was, a, deity, specifically, an, immortal, son, of, the, sun, to, gain, their, submission, without, conflict, some, of, the, natives, had, already, become, skeptical, of, de, soto, s, deity, claims, so, his, men, were, anxious, to, conceal, his, death, the, actual, site, of, his, burial, is, not, known, according, to, one, source, de, soto, s, men, hid, his, corpse, in, blankets, weighted, with, sand, and, sank, it, in, the, middle, of, the, mississippi, river, during, the, night, de, soto, s, expedition, had, explored, la, florida, for, three, years, without, finding, the, expected, treasures, or, a, hospitable, site, for, colonization, they, had, lost, nearly, half, their, men, and, most, of, the, horses, by, this, time, the, soldiers, were, wearing, animal, skins, for, clothing, many, were, injured, and, in, poor, health, the, leaders, came, to, a, consensus, although, not, total, to, end, the, expedition, and, try, to, find, a, way, home, either, down, the, mississippi, river, or, overland, across, texas, to, the, spanish, colony, of, mexico, city, they, decided, that, building, boats, would, be, too, difficult, and, time, consuming, and, that, navigating, the, gulf, of, mexico, was, too, risky, so, they, headed, overland, to, the, southwest, eventually, they, reached, a, region, in, present, day, texas, that, was, dry, the, native, populations, were, made, up, mostly, of, subsistence, hunter, gatherers, the, soldiers, found, no, villages, to, raid, for, food, and, the, army, was, still, too, large, to, live, off, the, land, they, were, forced, to, backtrack, to, the, more, developed, agricultural, regions, along, the, mississippi, where, they, began, building, seven, bergantines, or, pinnaces, they, melted, down, all, the, iron, including, horse, tackle, and, slave, shackles, to, make, nails, for, the, boats, they, survived, through, the, winter, and, the, spring, floods, delayed, them, another, two, months, by, july, they, set, off, on, their, makeshift, boats, down, the, mississippi, for, the, coast, taking, about, two, weeks, to, make, the, journey, the, expedition, encountered, hostile, fleets, of, war, canoes, along, the, whole, course, the, first, was, led, by, the, powerful, paramount, chief, quigualtam, whose, fleet, followed, the, boats, shooting, arrows, at, the, soldiers, for, days, as, they, drifted, through, their, territory, the, spanish, had, no, effective, offensive, weapons, on, the, water, as, their, crossbows, had, long, ceased, working, they, relied, on, armor, and, sleeping, mats, to, block, the, arrows, about, 11, spaniards, were, killed, along, this, stretch, and, many, more, wounded, on, reaching, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, they, stayed, close, to, the, gulf, shore, heading, south, and, west, after, about, 50, days, they, made, it, to, the, p, nuco, river, and, the, spanish, frontier, town, of, p, nuco, there, they, rested, for, about, a, month, during, this, time, many, of, the, spaniards, having, safely, returned, and, reflecting, on, their, accomplishments, decided, they, had, left, la, florida, too, soon, there, were, some, fights, within, the, company, leading, to, some, deaths, but, after, they, reached, mexico, city, and, the, viceroy, don, antonio, de, mendoza, offered, to, lead, another, expedition, to, la, florida, few, of, the, survivors, volunteered, of, the, recorded, 700, participants, at, the, start, between, 300, and, 350, survived, 311, is, a, commonly, accepted, figure, most, of, the, men, stayed, in, the, new, world, settling, in, mexico, peru, cuba, and, other, spanish, colonies, the, spanish, believed, that, de, soto, s, excursion, to, florida, was, a, failure, they, acquired, neither, gold, nor, prosperity, and, founded, no, colonies, but, the, expedition, had, several, major, consequences, it, contributed, to, the, process, of, the, columbian, exchange, for, instance, some, of, the, swine, brought, by, de, soto, escaped, and, became, the, ancestors, of, feral, razorback, pigs, in, the, southeastern, united, states, de, soto, was, instrumental, in, contributing, to, the, development, of, a, hostile, relationship, between, many, native, american, tribes, and, europeans, when, his, expedition, encountered, hostile, natives, in, the, new, lands, more, often, than, not, it, was, his, men, who, instigated, the, clashes, more, devastating, than, the, battles, were, the, diseases, which, may, have, been, carried, by, the, members, of, the, expedition, because, the, indigenous, people, lacked, the, immunity, which, the, europeans, had, acquired, through, generations, of, exposure, to, these, eurasian, diseases, the, native, americans, may, have, suffered, epidemics, of, illness, after, exposure, to, such, diseases, as, measles, smallpox, and, chicken, pox, several, areas, traversed, by, the, expedition, became, depopulated, potentially, by, disease, caused, by, contact, with, the, europeans, seeing, the, high, fatalities, and, devastation, caused, many, natives, would, have, fled, the, populated, areas, for, the, surrounding, hills, and, swamps, in, some, areas, the, social, structure, would, have, changed, because, of, high, population, losses, due, to, epidemics, however, recent, scholars, have, begun, to, question, whether, the, expedition, brought, novel, disease, at, all, the, arrival, of, many, diseases, aside, from, malaria, is, disputed, and, they, may, not, have, entered, the, region, until, much, later, the, first, documented, smallpox, epidemic, in, the, southeast, arrived, in, 1696, and, mississippian, social, structures, persisted, in, some, parts, of, the, region, until, the, 18th, century, the, records, of, the, expedition, contributed, greatly, to, european, knowledge, about, the, geography, biology, and, ethnology, of, the, new, world, the, de, soto, expedition, s, descriptions, of, north, american, natives, are, the, earliest, known, source, of, information, about, the, societies, in, the, southeast, they, are, the, only, european, description, of, the, culture, and, habits, of, north, american, native, tribes, before, these, peoples, encountered, other, europeans, de, soto, s, men, were, both, the, first, and, nearly, the, last, europeans, to, witness, the, villages, and, civilization, of, the, mississippian, culture, de, soto, s, expedition, led, the, spanish, crown, to, reconsider, spain, s, attitude, toward, the, colonies, north, of, mexico, he, claimed, large, parts, of, north, america, for, spain, many, parks, towns, counties, and, institutions, have, been, named, after, hernando, de, soto, to, include
