adopted, the, idea, of, moscow, as, the, third, rome, his, 43, year, reign, was, the, second, longest, in, russian, history, after, that, of, his, grandson, ivan, iv, ivan, vasilyevich, was, born, on, 22, january, 1440, into, the, family, of, vasily, ii, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, and, maria, of, borovsk, the, daughter, of, an, appanage, prince, and, a, granddaughter, of, vladimir, the, bold, the, first, time, ivan, is, called, heir, and, grand, prince, in, treaties, between, his, father, and, other, russian, princes, is, in, a, treaty, with, ivan, vasilyevich, of, suzdal, dating, from, 1448, or, 1449, the, title, of, grand, prince, is, not, included, in, a, treaty, with, casimir, iv, of, poland, dating, from, 13, august, 1449, but, appears, again, in, treaties, with, vasily, yaroslavich, of, serpukhov, in, the, early, 1450s, ivan, had, four, brothers, yury, andrey, bolshoy, the, big, boris, and, andrey, menshoy, the, little, in, the, same, will, that, vasily, ii, had, given, ivan, iii, the, grand, principality, his, brothers, were, awarded, appanages, yury, was, given, dmitrov, mozhaysk, and, serpukhov, andrey, bolshoy, was, given, uglich, bezhetsk, and, verkh, and, zvenigorod, boris, was, given, volokolamsk, rzhev, and, ruza, while, andrey, menshoy, was, given, vologda, ivan, s, rule, is, marked, by, vastly, expanding, the, territory, and, his, control, of, muscovy, as, part, of, the, successful, gathering, of, the, russian, lands, ivan, brought, the, independent, duchies, of, different, rurikid, princes, under, the, direct, control, of, moscow, leaving, the, princes, and, their, posterity, without, royal, titles, or, land, inheritance, it, was, during, ivan, s, reign, that, the, emergence, of, a, centralized, russian, state, occurred, following, a, period, of, feudal, fragmentation, with, moscow, at, its, center, following, a, war, with, the, novgorod, republic, in, 1456, due, to, novgorod, s, support, of, the, rebellious, dmitry, shemyaka, against, vasily, ii, in, his, civil, war, moscow, began, to, gradually, seize, land, in, the, northern, territories, that, were, formerly, under, novgorodian, control, for, the, next, decade, and, half, due, to, a, desire, for, luxury, furs, in, the, area, this, led, to, a, struggle, with, novgorod, for, the, russian, fur, trade, and, thus, an, economic, rivalry, for, fur, land, and, trade, ports, some, novgorodian, boyars, were, opposed, to, moscow, as, a, result, while, others, pursued, a, pro, moscow, policy, in, the, hopes, that, good, relations, could, reduce, disruption, in, east, west, trade, while, novgorod, was, also, dependent, on, the, russian, lands, to, its, southwest, for, important, imports, such, as, grain, some, novgorodians, were, also, attracted, to, moscow, due, to, it, being, the, center, of, russian, orthodoxy, as, opposed, to, lithuania, where, catholicism, was, dominant, and, its, culture, was, being, increasingly, polonized, though, some, novgorodian, clergy, adopted, a, pro, lithuanian, policy, for, political, reasons, due, to, fears, that, embracing, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, would, eventually, lead, to, the, end, of, novgorod, s, independence, by, 1470, with, the, pro, lithuanian, faction, being, dominant, the, novgorodian, boyars, questioned, ivan, s, sovereignty, over, the, city, state, as, their, prince, novgorod, negotiated, with, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, requested, casimir, iv, to, send, them, a, prince, this, led, to, mikhailo, olelkovich, ivan, s, cousin, to, be, accepted, as, the, new, prince, though, he, would, step, down, as, prince, shortly, after, ivan, saw, the, actions, of, novgorod, as, a, cause, for, war, and, he, also, called, it, an, act, of, apostasy, from, orthodoxy, in, part, because, poland, and, its, monarchs, were, catholic, ivan, led, his, troops, to, novgorod, where, his, army, defeated, the, novgorodians, at, the, battle, of, shelon, on, 14, july, 1471, ivan, then, had, the, four, leaders, of, the, anti, moscow, faction, in, novgorod, executed, including, the, son, of, marfa, boretskaya, an, influential, boyar, woman, who, had, played, a, leading, role, in, the, faction, in, a, peace, treaty, signed, on, 11, august, 1471, novgorod, agreed, to, abandon, its, overtures, to, lithuania, and, to, cede, a, considerable, portion, of, its, northern, territories, while, paying, a, war, indemnity, of, 15, 500, rubles, novgorod, also, had, to, recognize, moscow, s, claims, to, territories, to, the, east, of, the, northern, dvina, which, they, had, been, struggling, over, ivan, took, a, promise, of, allegiance, from, novgorod, but, left, its, system, of, government, in, place, for, the, next, six, years, pro, moscow, and, anti, moscow, factions, in, novgorod, competed, with, one, another, ivan, visited, novgorod, several, times, during, this, period, persecuting, a, number, of, pro, lithuanian, boyars, and, confiscating, their, lands, in, 1477, two, novgorodian, envoys, claiming, to, have, been, sent, by, the, archbishops, and, the, entire, city, addressed, ivan, in, public, audience, as, gosudar, sovereign, instead, of, the, usual, gospodin, sir, ivan, at, once, seized, upon, this, as, a, recognition, of, his, sovereignty, and, when, the, novgorodians, repudiated, the, envoys, indeed, one, was, killed, at, the, veche, and, several, others, of, the, pro, moscow, faction, were, killed, with, him, and, swore, openly, in, front, of, the, moscow, ambassadors, that, they, would, turn, to, lithuania, again, he, marched, against, them, surrounded, by, ivan, s, army, novgorod, ultimately, recognized, ivan, s, direct, rule, over, the, city, and, its, vast, hinterland, in, a, document, signed, and, sealed, by, archbishop, feofil, of, novgorod, 1470, 1480, on, 15, january, 1478, ivan, dispossessed, novgorod, of, more, than, four, fifths, of, its, land, keeping, half, for, himself, and, giving, the, other, half, to, his, allies, subsequent, revolts, 1479, 1488, were, punished, by, the, removal, en, masse, of, the, richest, and, most, ancient, families, of, novgorod, to, moscow, vyatka, and, other, cities, many, merchants, landholders, and, boyars, were, replaced, with, loyalists, who, came, from, moscow, the, novgorod, veche, and, its, elected, offices, were, also, abolished, archbishop, feofil, was, also, removed, to, moscow, for, plotting, against, the, grand, prince, the, rival, republic, of, pskov, owed, the, continuance, of, its, own, political, existence, to, the, readiness, with, which, it, assisted, ivan, against, its, old, enemy, the, acquisition, of, novgorod, alone, nearly, doubled, the, size, of, his, realm, soon, after, the, formal, annexation, of, novgorod, ivan, assumed, the, title, of, sovereign, of, all, russia, gosudar, vseya, rusi, the, title, reflected, his, achievements, in, uniting, the, russian, lands, but, also, implied, claims, to, other, territories, inhabited, by, the, east, slavs, which, were, under, the, control, of, the, lithuanian, grand, dukes, and, would, later, lead, to, conflict, with, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, other, principalities, were, eventually, absorbed, by, conquest, purchase, or, marriage, contract, the, principality, of, yaroslavl, in, 1463, rostov, in, 1474, tver, in, 1485, and, vyatka, 1489, ivan, also, increased, moscow, s, dominance, over, pskov, with, his, son, and, successor, vasily, iii, formally, annexing, it, in, 1510, prince, mikhail, andreyevich, of, vereya, who, had, been, awarded, an, appanage, by, vasily, ii, was, pressured, in, 1478, into, giving, belozersk, to, ivan, who, received, all, of, mikhail, s, land, on, his, death, in, 1486, some, princes, from, the, upper, oka, region, who, had, been, under, lithuanian, rule, left, lithuanian, service, and, joined, the, muscovite, court, in, the, 1480s, including, the, vorotynskys, odoyevskys, gorchakovs, and, others, a, peace, treaty, signed, on, 5, february, 1494, legalized, the, acquisitions, moscow, also, subjugated, several, finno, ugric, tribes, to, the, east, of, vyatka, in, the, late, 15th, century, some, of, whom, had, fled, eastward, as, far, as, the, ob, river, but, by, 1500, they, were, all, paying, tribute, whereas, his, father, vasily, ii, followed, the, custom, of, dividing, the, realm, between, his, sons, seeing, this, as, a, cause, for, weakness, and, instability, ivan, consolidated, his, exclusive, control, over, muscovy, during, his, reign, ivan, s, refusal, to, share, his, conquests, with, his, brothers, and, his, subsequent, interference, with, the, internal, politics, of, their, inherited, principalities, involved, him, in, several, wars, with, them, from, which, though, the, princes, were, assisted, by, lithuania, he, emerged, victorious, finally, ivan, s, new, rule, of, government, formally, set, forth, in, his, last, will, to, the, effect, that, the, domains, of, all, his, kinsfolk, after, their, deaths, should, pass, directly, to, the, reigning, grand, prince, instead, of, reverting, as, hitherto, to, the, princes, heirs, put, an, end, once, and, for, all, to, these, semi, independent, princelings, ivan, had, four, brothers, the, eldest, yury, died, childless, on, 12, september, 1472, he, only, had, a, draft, of, a, will, that, said, nothing, about, his, land, ivan, seized, the, land, much, to, the, fury, of, the, surviving, brothers, whom, he, placated, with, some, land, boris, and, andrey, bolshoy, signed, treaties, with, vasily, in, february, and, september, 1473, they, agreed, to, protect, each, other, s, land, and, not, to, have, secret, dealings, with, foreign, states, they, broke, this, clause, in, 1480, fleeing, to, lithuania, it, is, unknown, whether, andrey, menshoy, signed, a, treaty, he, died, in, 1481, leaving, his, lands, to, ivan, in, 1491, andrey, bolshoy, was, arrested, by, ivan, for, refusing, to, aid, the, crimean, khanate, against, the, golden, horde, he, died, in, prison, in, 1493, and, ivan, seized, his, land, in, 1494, boris, the, only, brother, able, to, pass, his, land, to, his, sons, died, however, their, land, reverted, to, the, tsar, upon, their, deaths, in, 1503, and, 1515, respectively, the, character, of, the, government, of, moscow, changed, significantly, under, ivan, iii, taking, on, a, new, autocratic, form, as, moscow, increased, its, hegemony, but, also, to, new, imperial, pretensions, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, orthodox, canonists, were, inclined, to, regard, the, grand, princes, of, moscow, where, the, metropolitan, of, kiev, moved, in, 1325, after, the, mongol, invasions, as, the, successors, of, the, byzantine, emperors, ivan, himself, appeared, to, welcome, the, idea, and, he, began, to, use, the, title, of, tsar, in, foreign, correspondence, meaning, caesar, the, adoption, of, byzantine, symbolism, and, its, ceremonial, style, in, effect, allowed, for, the, muscovite, grand, prince, to, claim, the, powers, of, that, of, a, byzantine, emperor, russian, ruling, circles, were, already, well, aware, of, byzantine, traditions, including, the, court, hierarchy, and, symbolism, due, in, part, to, most, of, the, kievan, metropolitans, and, clerics, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, having, been, greeks, the, russians, had, also, long, called, the, byzantine, emperor, tsar, and, had, known, of, the, south, slavic, writers, who, gave, the, title, to, their, most, successful, rulers, a, serbian, monk, who, had, arrived, in, moscow, in, the, early, 1440s, helped, to, provide, the, foundation, for, the, title, having, composed, a, chronograph, which, included, the, prophecy, of, a, russian, clan, coming, to, rule, in, constantinople, he, also, referred, to, the, muscovite, grand, prince, as, the, orthodox, tsar, and, autocrat, following, the, council, of, florence, this, movement, coincided, with, a, change, in, the, family, circumstances, of, ivan, iii, after, the, death, of, his, first, consort, in, 1467, maria, of, tver, and, at, the, suggestion, of, pope, paul, ii, in, 1469, who, hoped, thereby, to, bind, moscow, to, the, holy, see, ivan, iii, wedded, sophia, palaiologina, also, known, under, her, original, name, zoe, in, 1472, daughter, of, thomas, palaeologus, despot, of, morea, who, claimed, the, throne, of, constantinople, as, the, brother, of, constantine, xi, the, last, byzantine, emperor, frustrating, the, pope, s, hopes, of, reuniting, the, two, faiths, the, princess, endorsed, eastern, orthodoxy, due, to, her, family, traditions, she, encouraged, imperial, ideas, in, the, mind, of, her, consort, it, was, through, her, influence, that, the, ceremonious, etiquette, of, constantinople, along, with, the, imperial, double, headed, eagle, and, all, that, it, implied, was, adopted, by, the, court, of, moscow, ivan, combined, the, double, headed, eagle, with, his, emblem, of, st, george, slaying, the, dragon, his, family, seal, became, and, remained, a, symbol, of, the, russian, tsars, until, the, monarchy, was, abolished, in, 1917, ivan, s, marriage, would, add, to, moscow, s, prestige, after, the, russian, orthodox, church, had, earlier, declared, itself, autocephalous, in, 1448, and, a, native, metropolitan, was, installed, in, moscow, the, transformation, to, absolutism, was, supported, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, which, benefitted, from, moscow, s, increased, international, standing, with, the, doctrine, of, moscow, as, the, third, rome, beginning, to, emerge, ivan, s, son, with, maria, of, tver, ivan, ivanovich, whom, he, had, designated, as, his, heir, and, was, made, co, ruler, in, 1471, died, in, 1490, leaving, from, his, marriage, with, elena, of, moldavia, an, only, child, dmitry, ivanovich, ivan, attempted, to, secure, his, title, for, his, successor, and, the, latter, was, crowned, as, successor, by, his, grandfather, on, 15, february, 1498, but, later, ivan, reverted, his, decision, in, favor, of, sophia, s, elder, son, vasily, who, was, ultimately, crowned, co, regent, with, his, father, on, 14, april, 1502, the, decision, was, dictated, by, the, crisis, connected, with, the, sect, of, skhariya, the, jew, as, well, as, by, the, imperial, prestige, of, sophia, s, descendants, dmitry, was, put, into, prison, where, he, died, unmarried, and, childless, in, 1509, already, under, the, rule, of, his, uncle, his, successor, vasily, was, made, co, ruler, in, 1502, and, during, vasily, s, reign, he, would, expand, the, usage, of, the, title, of, tsar, in, all, matters, the, grand, prince, increasingly, held, aloof, from, his, boyars, who, were, a, barrier, to, the, transformation, to, absolutism, as, a, result, he, gradually, reduced, the, boyars, economic, and, political, powers, he, granted, estates, called, pomestie, to, a, new, noble, class, in, exchange, for, military, service, and, other, conditions, allowing, him, to, build, up, a, centralized, army, and, create, a, counterbalance, to, the, boyars, the, old, patriarchal, systems, of, government, vanished, the, boyars, who, would, meet, in, a, council, known, as, a, boyar, duma, were, no, longer, consulted, on, state, affairs, the, sovereign, became, sacrosanct, while, the, boyars, were, reduced, to, dependency, on, the, will, of, the, sovereign, the, boyars, naturally, resented, this, revolution, and, struggled, against, it, it, was, in, the, reign, of, ivan, iii, that, the, new, sudebnik, or, law, code, was, compiled, by, the, scribe, vladimir, gusev, the, death, penalty, was, mandated, for, rebellion, or, sedition, which, was, a, more, severe, penalty, compared, to, that, of, the, earlier, russkaya, pravda, it, restricted, the, mobility, of, peasants, also, requiring, an, exit, fee, to, be, paid, to, the, landlords, which, were, in, the, interests, of, the, new, noble, class, ivan, therefore, laid, the, groundwork, for, serfdom, which, would, negatively, impact, russia, s, development, in, the, following, centuries, ivan, did, his, utmost, to, make, his, capital, a, worthy, successor, to, constantinople, and, with, that, object, invited, many, foreign, masters, and, artificers, to, settle, in, moscow, ivan, s, most, notable, construction, was, the, rebuilding, of, the, kremlin, in, moscow, the, most, noted, of, these, architects, was, the, italian, ridolfo, di, fioravante, nicknamed, aristotle, because, of, his, extraordinary, knowledge, who, built, several, cathedrals, and, palaces, in, the, kremlin, and, also, supervised, the, construction, of, the, walls, of, the, kremlin, these, include, the, dormition, cathedral, and, palace, of, facets, construction, of, the, ivan, the, great, bell, tower, also, started, in, 1505, which, was, completed, after, his, death, moscow, played, an, increasingly, visible, role, in, international, affairs, as, it, established, diplomatic, relations, with, the, crimean, khanate, and, the, republic, of, venice, in, 1474, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, 1482, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1489, the, kingdom, of, denmark, in, 1493, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1496, the, outline, of, russian, foreign, policy, for, the, next, several, generations, was, shaped, during, ivan, s, reign, where, his, successors, would, continue, to, struggle, with, poland, and, lithuania, over, the, territories, of, the, east, slavs, while, a, more, differentiated, policy, was, pursued, towards, the, muslim, khanates, with, attempts, at, subjugating, the, khanate, of, kazan, and, neutralizing, the, crimean, khanate, in, 1476, ivan, refused, to, pay, the, customary, tribute, to, ahmed, khan, and, in, 1480, ahmed, khan, launched, an, invasion, of, russia, throughout, the, autumn, the, muscovite, and, tatar, hosts, confronted, each, other, on, opposite, sides, of, the, ugra, river, until, 11, november, 1480, when, ahmed, retreated, into, the, steppe, in, traditional, russian, historiography, it, is, marked, as, the, end, of, the, tatar, yoke, over, russia, in, the, following, year, ahmed, khan, while, preparing, a, second, expedition, against, moscow, was, suddenly, attacked, routed, and, slain, by, khan, ibak, of, the, nogai, horde, whereupon, the, golden, horde, suddenly, fell, to, pieces, in, 1487, ivan, reduced, the, khanate, of, kazan, one, of, the, offshoots, of, the, horde, to, the, condition, of, a, vassal, state, though, in, his, later, years, it, broke, away, from, his, suzerainty, with, the, other, muslim, powers, the, khan, of, the, crimean, khanate, and, the, sultans, of, the, ottoman, empire, ivan, s, relations, were, peaceful, and, even, amicable, the, crimean, khan, me, li, i, giray, helped, him, against, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, facilitated, the, opening, of, diplomatic, relations, between, moscow, and, constantinople, where, the, first, embassy, appeared, in, 1495, the, christian, rulers, in, the, caucasus, began, to, see, the, russian, monarchs, as, their, natural, allies, against, the, muslim, regional, powers, the, first, attempt, at, forging, an, alliance, was, made, by, alexander, i, king, of, a, small, georgian, kingdom, of, kakheti, who, dispatched, two, embassies, in, 1483, and, 1491, to, moscow, however, as, the, russians, were, still, too, far, from, the, caucasus, neither, of, these, missions, had, any, effect, on, the, course, of, events, in, the, region, in, 1488, ivan, sought, gun, founders, master, gunners, for, siege, cannons, gold, and, silversmiths, and, italian, master, builders, from, king, matthias, corvinus, in, his, dealings, with, the, habsburgs, ivan, was, offered, the, title, of, king, rex, if, he, would, join, the, alliance, against, turkey, but, he, rejected, such, offers, and, continued, his, own, policy, laying, claim, to, the, kievan, legacy, and, adopting, the, title, of, autocrat, samoderzhets, sovereign, gosudar, of, the, russian, land, and, grand, prince, of, moscow, and, all, russia, beginning, in, 1484, ivan, began, to, use, the, title, of, tsar, in, his, foreign, correspondence, with, secondary, powers, in, europe, including, the, livonian, order, at, times, the, title, was, translated, as, imperator, such, as, in, a, 1493, treaty, with, denmark, where, ivan, was, called, domino, johanne, totius, rutzie, imperator, ivan, also, began, insisting, on, the, title, to, the, habsburgs, in, 1489, and, he, continued, to, portray, himself, to, his, subjects, and, foreign, states, as, the, orthodox, emperor, whenever, was, possible, in, diplomatic, situations, ivan, and, his, representatives, would, refer, to, him, as, tsar, according, to, isabel, de, madariaga, had, the, title, of, russian, monarchs, continued, to, be, translated, as, rex, russia, s, assimilation, into, the, ranking, order, of, states, in, europe, would, have, been, much, easier, in, nordic, affairs, ivan, concluded, an, offensive, alliance, with, john, of, denmark, and, maintained, regular, correspondence, with, emperor, maximilian, i, who, called, him, a, brother, he, built, a, strong, citadel, in, ingria, named, ivangorod, after, himself, situated, on, the, russian, estonian, border, opposite, the, fortress, of, narva, held, by, the, livonian, confederation, in, the, russo, swedish, war, ivan, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, conquer, vyborg, from, sweden, but, this, attempt, was, checked, by, the, swedish, garrison, in, vyborg, castle, led, by, lord, knut, posse, ivan, deemed, moscow, to, be, the, legitimate, heir, to, the, territories, that, formerly, belonged, to, kievan, rus, leading, to, wars, with, lithuania, including, skirmishes, in, the, late, 1480s, and, early, 1490s, the, further, extension, of, his, dominion, was, facilitated, by, the, death, of, casimir, iv, in, 1492, when, poland, and, lithuania, once, again, parted, company, the, throne, of, lithuania, was, now, occupied, by, casimir, s, son, alexander, a, weak, and, lethargic, prince, so, incapable, of, defending, his, possessions, against, the, persistent, attacks, of, the, muscovites, that, he, attempted, to, save, them, by, a, matrimonial, compact, wedding, helena, ivan, s, daughter, but, the, clear, determination, of, ivan, to, appropriate, as, much, of, lithuania, as, possible, finally, compelled, alexander, to, take, up, arms, against, his, father, in, law, in, 1499, a, full, scale, war, broke, out, in, 1500, the, lithuanians, were, routed, at, the, battle, of, vedrosha, on, 14, july, 1500, and, in, 1503, alexander, was, glad, to, purchase, peace, by, ceding, chernigov, starodub, novgorod, seversky, and, sixteen, other, towns, however, smolensk, remained, in, lithuanian, hands, though, ivan, s, son, vasily, iii, would, take, the, city, in, 1514, ivan, conquered, or, brought, under, his, control, the, lands, of, great, russia, leading, to, russian, historians, to, call, him, the, gatherer, of, the, russian,
