republic, after, the, national, convention, decided, to, put, the, deposed, king, to, death, louis, philippe, began, to, consider, leaving, france, he, was, dismayed, that, his, own, father, known, then, as, philippe, galit, voted, in, favour, of, the, execution, louis, philippe, was, willing, to, stay, to, fulfill, his, duties, in, the, army, but, he, became, implicated, in, the, plot,

cried, out, against, the, general, now, declared, a, traitor, by, the, national, convention, shots, rang, out, as, the, two, men, fled, toward, the, austrian, camp, the, next, day, dumouriez, again, tried, to, rally, soldiers, against, the, convention, however, he, found, that, the, artillery, had, declared, itself, in, favour, of, the, republic, he, and, louis, philippe, had, no, choice, but, to, go, into, exile, when, philippe, galit, was, arrested, at, the, age, of, nineteen, and, already, ranked, as, a, lieutenant, general, louis, philippe, left, france, he, did, not, return, for, twenty, one, years, the, reaction, in, paris, to, louis, philippe, s, involvement, in, dumouriez, s, treason, inevitably, resulted, in, misfortunes, for, the, orl, ans, family, philippe, galit, spoke, in, the, national, convention, condemning, his, son, for, his, actions, asserting, that, he, would, not, spare, his, son, much, akin, to, the, roman, consul, brutus, and, his, sons, however, letters, from, louis, philippe, to, his, father, were, discovered, in, transit, and, were, read, out, to, the, convention, philippe, galit, was, then, put, under, continuous, surveillance, shortly, thereafter,

city, they, went, to, zug, where, louis, philippe, was, discovered, by, a, group, of, migr, s, it, became, quite, apparent, that, for, the, women, to, settle, peacefully, anywhere, they, would, have, to, separate, from, louis, philippe, he, then, left, with, his, faithful, valet, baudouin, for, the, heights, of, the, alps, and, then, to, basel, where, he, sold, all, but, one, of, his, horses, now,

ferdinand, iv, of, naples, and, maria, carolina, of, austria, the, ceremony, was, celebrated, in, palermo, 25, november, 1809, the, marriage, was, controversial, because, her, mother, s, younger, sister, was, queen, marie, antoinette, and, louis, philippe, s, father, was, considered, to, have, a, role, in, marie, antoinette, s, execution, the, queen, of, naples, was, opposed, to, the, match, for, this, reason, she, had, been, very, close, to, her, sister, and, devastated, by, her, execution, but, she, had, given, her, consent, after, louis, philippe, had, convinced, her, that, he, was, determined, to, compensate, for, the, mistakes, of, his, father, and, after, having, agreed, to, answer, all, her, questions, regarding, his, father, after, the, abdication, of, napoleon, louis, philippe, known, as, louis, philippe, duke, of, orl, ans, returned, to, france, during, the, reign, of, his, cousin, louis, xviii, at, the, time, of, the, bourbon, restoration, louis, philippe, had, reconciled, the, orl, ans, family, with, louis, xviii, in, exile, and, was, once, more, to, be, found, in, the, elaborate, royal, court, however, his, resentment, at, the, treatment, of, his, family, the, cadet, branch, of, the, house, of, bourbon, under, the, ancien, r, gime, caused, friction, between, him, and, louis, xviii, and, he, openly, sided, with, the, liberal, opposition, upon, his, return, to, paris, in, may, 1814, the, duke, of, orl, ans, was, restored, to, the, rank, of, lieutenant, general, in, the, army, by, louis, xviii, he, was, denied, the, title, of, altesse, royale, royal, highness, although, it, was, accorded, to, his, wife, louis, philippe, had, to, settle, for, the, lesser, altesse, serenissime, serene, highness, less, than, a, year, after, returning, to, france, he, and, his, family, were, uprooted, by, the, return, of, napol, on, from, elba, known, as, the, hundred, days, on, 6, march, 1815, after, the, news, of, napol, on, s, return, to, france, reached, paris, louis, philippe, was, dispatched, to, lyon, with, the, comte, d, artois, the, future, charles, x, to, organize, a, defense, against, the, emperor, but, the, hopelessness, of, the, situation, soon, became, apparent, and, he, was, back, in, the, capital, by, the, 12th, thereafter, louis, xviii, made, him, commander, of, the, army, of, the, north, in, the, days, after, napol, on, entered, paris, march, 20, louis, xviii, fled, to, belgium, and, louis, philippe, resigned, his, commission, choosing, to, join, his, family, in, exile, in, england, this, brought, him, further, scorn, from, royalists, because, he, did, not, join, louis, xviii, in, belgium, napol, on, was, soon, defeated, in, the, battle, of, waterloo, and, louis, xviii, was, restored, to, power, but, louis, philippe, and, his, family, only, returned, to, france, in, 1817, after, the, wave, of, repression, and, recriminations, had, faded, louis, philippe, was, on, far, friendlier, terms, with, louis, xviii, s, brother, and, successor, charles, x, who, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1824, and, with, whom, he, socialized, charles, x, granted, him, the, altesse, royale, title, and, permitted, louis, henri, prince, of, cond, to, make, louis, philippe, s, fourth, son, henri, d, orl, ans, duke, of, aumale, heir, to, the, domaine, of, chantilly, however, louis, philippe, s, opposition, to, the, policies, of, joseph, de, vill, le, and, later, of, jules, de, polignac, caused, him, to, be, viewed, as, a, constant, threat, to, the, stability, of, charles, government, this, soon, proved, to, be, to, his, advantage, in, 1830, the, july, revolution, overthrew, charles, x, who, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, 10, year, old, grandson, henri, duke, of, bordeaux, charles, x, named, louis, philippe, lieutenant, g, n, ral, du, royaume, and, charged, him, to, announce, his, desire, to, have, his, grandson, succeed, him, to, the, popularly, elected, chamber, of, deputies, louis, philippe, did, not, do, this, in, order, to, increase, his, own, chances, of, succession, as, a, consequence, because, the, chamber, was, aware, of, his, liberal, policies, and, of, his, popularity, with, the, masses, they, proclaimed, louis, philippe, as, the, new, french, king, displacing, the, senior, branch, of, the, house, of, bourbon, for, the, prior, eleven, days, louis, philippe, had, been, acting, as, the, regent, for, the, young, henri, charles, x, and, his, family, including, his, grandson, went, into, exile, in, the, united, kingdom, the, young, ex, king, the, duke, of, bordeaux, in, exile, took, the, title, of, comte, de, chambord, later, he, became, the, pretender, to, the, throne, of, france, and, was, supported, by, the, legitimists, louis, philippe, was, sworn, in, as, king, louis, philippe, i, on, 9, august, 1830, upon, his, accession, to, the, throne, louis, philippe, assumed, the, title, of, king, of, the, french, a, title, previously, adopted, by, louis, xvi, in, the, short, lived, constitution, of, 1791, linking, the, monarchy, to, a, people, instead, of, a, territory, as, the, previous, designation, king, of, france, and, of, navarre, was, aimed, at, undercutting, the, legitimist, claims, of, charles, x, and, his, family, by, an, ordinance, he, signed, on, 13, august, 1830, the, new, king, defined, the, manner, in, which, his, children, as, well, as, his, beloved, sister, would, continue, to, bear, the, surname, d, orl, ans, and, the, arms, of, orl, ans, declared, that, his, eldest, son, as, prince, royal, not, dauphin, would, bear, the, title, duke, of, orl, ans, that, the, younger, sons, would, continue, to, have, their, previous, titles, and, that, his, sister, and, daughters, would, be, styled, princesses, of, orl, ans, not, of, france, his, ascent,

unpretentious, fashion, avoiding, the, pomp, and, lavish, spending, of, his, predecessors, despite, this, outward, appearance, of, simplicity, his, support, came, from, the, wealthy, bourgeoisie, at, first, he, was, much, loved, and, called, the, citizen, king, and, the, bourgeois, monarch, but, his, popularity, suffered, as, his, government, was, perceived, as, increasingly, conservative, and, monarchical, because, he, owed, his, elevation, to, a, revolution, in, paris, and, a, faction, of, liberal, deputies, in, the, parliament, of, charles, x, louis, philippe, s, rule, lacked, the, mystical, appeal, of, its, divine, right, predecessor, support, for, it, was, to, a, much, greater, degree, conditional, unlike, his, predecessor, he, did, not, have, a, dynastic, legacy, to, draw, on, so, he, turned, to, the, glories, of, napoleon, i, to, prop, up, his, own, regime, he, supported, the, return, of, napoleon, s, remains, to, france, and, his, son, the, duke, of, joinville, brought, the, remains, from, saint, helena, for, reinterment, at, les, invalides, the, statue, of, napoleon, was, returned, to, its, spot, atop, the, vend, me, column, in, 1833, and, the, arc, de,

went, on, to, preside, over, a, regime, which, rapidly, gained, notoriety, for, political, repression, of, the, left, class, oppression, of, the, poor, and, rule, in, the, interests, of, the, rich, in, foreign, affairs, it, was, a, quiet, period, with, friendship, with, great, britain, in, october, 1844, he, paid, a, visit, to, queen, victoria, at, windsor, castle, this, made, him, the, first,

parisians, blamed, louis, philippe, and, his, government, for, their, perceived, inaction, in, the, face, of, the, epidemic, this, resentment, culminated, in, the, short, lived, republican, uprising,

who, descended, on, the, city, louis, philippe, showed, a, cool, resolve, throughout, the, crisis, coming, to, paris, as, soon, as, he, was, informed, of, the, disturbances, greeting, the, troops, and, going, amongst, the, people, an, industrial, and, agricultural, depression, in, 1846, led, to, the, 1848, revolutions, and, louis, philippe, s, abdication, the, dissonance, between, his, positive, early, reputation, and, his, late, unpopularity, was, epitomized, by, victor, hugo, in, les, mis, rables, as, an, oxymoron, describing, his, reign, as, prince, equality, in, which, hugo,
