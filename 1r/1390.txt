did, not, end, with, japan, annexing, siberia, which, popular, opinion, had, demanded, the, treaty, of, portsmouth, was, so, unpopular, that, it, set, off, anti, american, riots, known, as, the, hibiya, incendiary, incident, as, many, japanese, were, enraged, at, the, way, the, americans, had, apparently, cheated, japan, as, the, japanese, gains, in, the, treaty, were, far, less, than, what, public, opinion, had, expected, very, few, japanese, at, the, time, had, understood, that, the, war, against, russia, had, pushed, their, nation, to, the, verge, of, bankruptcy, and, most, people, in,

he, took, a, train, ride, across, the, united, states, his, first, and, only, visit, to, north, america, which, left, him, with, the, impression, that, the, americans, were, a, materialistic, soft,

greatly, offended, by, the, immigration, control, act, which, was, passed, by, the, us, congress, it, banned, all, asian, immigration, into, the, united, states, with, many, representatives, and, senators, openly, saying, the, act, was, necessary, because, the, asians, worked, harder, than, whites, he, wrote, with, bitterness, at, the, time, that, american, whites, would, never, accept,

command, tojo, often, visited, the, homes, of, the, men, under, his, command, assisted, his, men, with, personal, problems, and, made, loans, to, officers, short, of, money, like, many, other, japanese, officers, he, disliked, western, cultural, influence, in, japan, which, was, often, disparaged, as, resulting, in, the, ero, guro, nansensu, eroticism, grotesquerie, and, nonsense, movement, as, he, complained, about, such, forms, of, western, decadence, like, young, couples, holding, hands, and, kissing, in, public, which, were, undermining, traditional, values, necessary, to, uphold,

this, book, of, fifteen, essays, by, senior, generals, argued, that, japan, had, defeated, russia, in, the, war, of, 1904, 05, because, bushid, had, given, the, japanese, superior, willpower, as, the, japanese, did, not, fear, death, unlike, the, russians, who, wanted, to, live, and, what, was, needed, to, win, the, inevitable, next, war, against, precisely, whom, the, book, did, not, say, was, to, repeat, the, example, of, the, russian, japanese, war, on, a, much, greater, scale, by, creating, the, national, defense, state, to, mobilize, the, entire, nation, for, war, in, his, essay, tojo,

and, favored, direct, imperial, rule, that, ensured, that, he, would, faithfully, follow, any, order, from, the, emperor, konoe, favored, having, germany, mediate, an, end, to, the, sino, japanese, war, pressured, britain, to, end, its, economic, and, military, support, of, china, even, at, the, risk, of, war, sought, better, relations, with, both, germany, and, the, united, states, and, took,

the, dominant, power, in, east, asia, but, he, also, believed, it, was, possible, to, negotiate, a, modus, vivendi, with, the, united, states, under, which, the, americans, would, agree, to, recognize, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, by, 1940, konoe, who, had, started, the, war, with, china, in, 1937, no, longer, believed, that, a, military, solution, to, the, china, affair, was, possible, and, instead, favored, having, germany, mediate, an, end, to, the, war, that, would, presumably, result, in, a, pro, japanese, peace, settlement, but, would, be, less, than, he, himself, had, outlined, in, the, konoe, programme, of, january, 1938, for, this, reason, konoe, wanted, tojo, a, tough, general, whose, ultra, nationalism, was, beyond, question, to, provide, cover, for, his, attempt, to, seek, a, diplomatic, solution, to, the, war, with, china, tojo, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, tripartite, pact, between, imperial, japan, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, as, the, army, minister, he, continued, to, expand, the, war, against, china, after, negotiations, with, vichy, france, japan, was, given, permission, to, place, its, troops, in, the, southern, part, of, french, indochina, in, july, 1941, in, spite, of, its, formal, recognition, of, the, vichy, government, the, united, states, retaliated, against, japan, by, imposing, economic, sanctions, in, august, including, a, total, embargo, on, oil, and, gasoline, exports, on, september, 6, a, deadline, of, early, october, was, fixed, in, the, imperial, conference, for, resolving, the, situation, diplomatically, on, october, 14, the, deadline, had, passed, with, no, progress, prime, minister, konoe, then, held, his, last, cabinet, meeting, in, which, tojo, did, most, of, the, talking, for, the, past, six, months, ever, since, april, the, foreign, minister, has, made, painstaking, efforts, to, adjust, relations, although, i, respect, him, for, that, we, remain, deadlocked, the, heart, of, the, matter, is, the, imposition, on, us, of, withdrawal, from, indochina, and, china, if, we, yield, to, america, s, demands, it, will, destroy, the, fruits, of, the, china, incident, manchukuo, will, be, endangered, and, our, control, of, korea, undermined, the, prevailing, opinion, within, the, japanese, army, at, that, time, was, that, continued, negotiations, could, be, dangerous, however, hirohito, thought, that, he, might, be, able, to, control, extreme, opinions, in, the, army, by, using, the, charismatic, and, well, connected, tojo, who, had, expressed, reservations, regarding, war, with, the, west, but, the, emperor, himself, was, skeptical, that, tojo, would, be, able, to, avoid, conflict, on, october, 13, he, declared, to, k, ichi, kido, there, seems, little, hope, in, the, present, situation, for, the, japan, u, s, negotiations, this, time, if, hostilities, erupt, i, have, to, issue, a, declaration, of, war, during, the, last, cabinet, meetings, of, the, konoe, government, tojo, emerged, as, a, hawkish, voice, saying, he, did, not, want, a, war, with, the, united, states, but, portrayed, the, americans, as, arrogant, bullying, white, supremacists, he, said, that, any, compromise, solution, would, only, encourage, them, to, make, more, extreme, demands, on, japan, in, which, case, japan, might, be, better, off, choosing, war, to, uphold, national, honor, despite, saying, he, favored, peace, tojo, had, often, declared, at, cabinet, meetings, that, any, withdrawal, from, french, indochina, and, or, china, would, be, damaging, to, military, morale, and, might, threaten, the, kokutai, the, china, incident, could, not, be, resolved, via, diplomacy, and, required, a, military, solution, and, attempting, to, compromise, with, the, americans, would, be, seen, as, weakness, by, them, on, october, 16, konoe, politically, isolated, and, convinced, that, the, emperor, no, longer, trusted, him, resigned, later, he, justified, himself, to, his, chief, cabinet, secretary, kenji, tomita, of, course, his, majesty, is, a, pacifist, and, there, is, no, doubt, he, wished, to, avoid, war, when, i, told, him, that, to, initiate, war, is, a, mistake, he, agreed, but, the, next, day, he, would, tell, me, you, were, worried, about, it, yesterday, but, you, do, not, have, to, worry, so, much, thus, gradually, he, began, to, lean, toward, war, and, the, next, time, i, met, him, he, leaned, even, more, toward, war, in, short, i, felt, the, emperor, was, telling, me, my, prime, minister, does, not, understand, military, matters, i, know, much, more, in, short, the, emperor, had, absorbed, the, views, of, the, army, and, navy, high, commands, at, the, time, prince, naruhiko, higashikuni, was, said, to, be, the, only, person, who, could, control, the, army, and, the, navy, and, was, recommended, by, konoe, and, tojo, as, konoe, s, replacement, hirohito, rejected, this, option, arguing, that, a, member, of, the, imperial, family, should, not, have, to, eventually, carry, the, responsibility, for, a, war, against, the, west, as, a, defeat, would, ruin, the, prestige, of, the, house, of, yamato, following, the, advice, of, k, ichi, kido, he, chose, instead, tojo, who, was, known, for, his, devotion, to, the, imperial, institution, by, tradition, the, emperor, needed, a, consensus, among, the, elder, statesmen, or, jushin, before, appointing, a, prime, minister, and, as, long, as, former, prime, minister, admiral, keisuke, okada, was, opposed, to, tojo, it, would, be, impolitic, for, the, emperor, to, appoint, him, during, the, meetings, of, the, jushin, regarding, prince, konoe, s, succession, okada, argued, against, tojo, s, appointment, while, the, powerful, lord, privy, seal, k, ichi, kido, pushed, for, tojo, the, result, was, a, compromise, where, tojo, would, become, prime, minister, while, re, examining, the, options, for, dealing, with, the, crisis, with, the, united, states, though, no, promise, was, made, tojo, would, attempt, to, avoid, a, war, after, being, informed, of, tojo, s, appointment, prince, takamatsu, wrote, in, his, diary, we, have, finally, committed, to, war, and, now, must, do, all, we, can, to, launch, it, powerfully, but, we, have, clumsily, telegraphed, our, intentions, we, needn, t, have, signaled, what, we, re, going, to, do, having, resign, was, too, much, as, matters, stand, now, we, can, merely, keep, silent, and, without, the, least, effort, war, will, begin, tojo, s, first, speech, on, the, radio, made, a, call, for, world, peace, but, also, stated, his, determination, to, settle, the, china, affair, on, japanese, terms, and, to, achieve, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, that, would, unite, all, of, the, asian, nations, together, the, emperor, summoned, tojo, to, the, imperial, palace, one, day, before, tojo, took, office, after, being, informed, of, his, appointment, tojo, was, given, one, order, from, the, emperor, to, make, a, policy, review, of, what, had, been, sanctioned, by, the, imperial, conferences, despite, being, vocally, on, the, side, of, war, tojo, nevertheless, accepted, the, order, and, pledged, to, obey, according, to, colonel, akiho, ishii, a, member, of, the, army, general, staff, the, newly, appointed, prime, minister, showed, a, true, sense, of, loyalty, to, the, emperor, performing, the, duty, for, example, when, ishii, received, from, hirohito, a, communication, saying, the, army, should, drop, the, idea, of, stationing, troops, in, china, to, counter, the, military, operations, of, the, western, powers, he, wrote, a, reply, for, tojo, for, his, audience, with, the, emperor, tojo, then, replied, to, ishii, if, the, emperor, said, it, should, be, so, then, that, s, it, for, me, one, cannot, recite, arguments, to, the, emperor, you, may, keep, your, finely, phrased, memorandum, on, november, 2, tojo, and, chiefs, of, staff, hajime, sugiyama, and, osami, nagano, reported, to, hirohito, that, the, review, had, been, in, vain, the, emperor, then, gave, his, consent, to, war, the, next, day, fleet, admiral, osami, nagano, explained, in, detail, the, pearl, harbor, attack, plan, to, hirohito, the, eventual, plan, drawn, up, by, army, and, navy, chiefs, of, staff, envisaged, such, a, mauling, of, the, western, powers, that, japanese, defense, perimeter, lines, operating, on, interior, lines, of, communications, and, inflicting, heavy, western, casualties, could, not, be, breached, in, addition, the, japanese, fleet, which, attacked, pearl, harbor, was, under, orders, from, admiral, isoroku, yamamoto, to, be, prepared, to, return, to, japan, on, a, moment, s, notice, should, negotiations, succeed, two, days, later, on, november, 5, hirohito, approved, the, operations, plan, for, a, war, against, the, west, and, continued, to, hold, meetings, with, the, military, and, tojo, until, the, end, of, the, month, on, november, 26, 1941, us, secretary, of, state, cordell, hull, handed, ambassador, nomura, and, kurusu, saburo, in, washington, a, draft, mutual, declaration, of, policy, and, outline, of, proposed, basis, for, agreement, between, the, united, states, and, japan, hull, proposed, that, japan, withdraw, all, military, naval, air, and, police, forces, from, china, and, french, indochina, in, exchange, for, lifting, the, oil, embargo, but, left, the, term, china, undefined, the, hull, note, as, it, is, known, in, japan, made, it, clear, the, united, states, would, not, recognise, the, puppet, government, of, wang, jingwei, as, the, government, of, china, but, strongly, implied, that, the, united, states, might, recognise, the, empire, of, manchukuo, and, did, not, impose, a, deadline, for, the, japanese, withdrawal, from, china, on, november, 27, 1941, tojo, chose, to, misrepresent, the, hull, note, to, the, cabinet, as, an, ultimatum, to, japan, which, was, incorrect, as, it, did, not, have, a, timeline, for, its, acceptance, and, was, marked, tentative, in, the, opening, sentence, which, is, inconsistent, with, an, ultimatum, the, claim, that, the, americans, had, demanded, in, the, hull, note, japanese, withdrawal, from, all, of, china, instead, of, just, the, parts, that, they, had, occupied, since, 1937, as, well, as, the, claim, the, note, was, an, ultimatum, was, used, as, one, of, the, principal, excuses, for, choosing, war, with, the, united, states, on, december, 1, another, conference, finally, sanctioned, the, war, against, the, united, states, england, and, the, netherlands, on, december, 8, 1941, december, 7, in, the, americas, tojo, went, on, japanese, radio, to, announce, that, japan, was, now, at, war, with, the, united, states, the, british, empire, and, the, netherlands, and, read, out, an, imperial, rescript, that, ended, with, the, playing, of, the, martial, song, umi, yukaba, across, the, sea, which, set, a, war, poem, from, the, classic, collection, many, sh, to, music, featuring, the, lyrics, across, the, sea, corpses, soaking, in, the, water, across, the, mountains, corpses, heaped, up, in, the, grass, we, shall, die, by, the, side, of, our, lord, we, shall, never, look, back, tojo, continued, to, hold, the, position, of, army, minister, during, his, term, as, prime, minister, from, october, 17, 1941, to, july, 22, 1944, he, also, served, concurrently, as, home, minister, from, 1941, to, 1942, foreign, minister, in, september, 1942, education, minister, in, 1943, and, minister, of, commerce, and, industry, in, 1943, as, education, minister, he, continued, militaristic, and, nationalist, indoctrination, in, the, national, education, system, and, reaffirmed, totalitarian, policies, in, government, as, home, minister, he, ordered, various, eugenics, measures, including, the, sterilization, of, the, mentally, unfit, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, tojo, had, popular, support, as, japanese, forces, moved, from, one, victory, to, another, in, march, 1942, in, his, capacity, as, army, minister, he, gave, permission, for, the, japanese, army, in, taiwan, to, ship, 50, comfort, women, from, taiwan, to, borneo, without, identification, papers, his, approval, was, necessary, as, army, rules, forbade, people, without, identification, traveling, to, the, new, conquests, the, japanese, historian, yoshiaki, yoshimi, noted, that, document, proves, that, tojo, knew, and, approved, of, the, comfort, women, corps, on, april, 18, 1942, the, americans, staged, the, doolittle, raid, bombing, tokyo, some, of, the, american, planes, were, shot, down, and, their, pilots, taken, prisoner, the, army, general, staff, led, by, field, marshal, hajime, sugiyama, insisted, on, executing, the, eight, american, fliers, but, was, opposed, by, tojo, who, feared, that, the, americans, would, retaliate, against, japanese, prisoners, of, war, if, the, doolittle, fliers, were, executed, the, dispute, was, resolved, by, the, emperor, who, commuted, the, death, sentences, of, five, fliers, but, allowed, the, other, three, to, die, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, as, the, documents, relating, to, the, emperor, s, intervention, were, burned, in, 1945, as, the, japanese, went, from, victory, to, victory, tojo, and, the, rest, of, the, japanese, elite, were, gripped, by, what, the, japanese, called, victory, disease, as, the, entire, elite, was, caught, up, in, a, state, of, hubris, believing, japan, was, invincible, and, the, war, was, as, good, as, won, by, may, 1942, tojo, approved, a, set, of, non, negotiable, demands, to, be, presented, once, the, allies, sued, for, peace, that, allowed, japan, to, keep, everything, it, already, conquered, while, assuming, possession, of, considerably, more, under, such, demands, japan, would, assume, control, of, the, following, territories, additionally, tojo, wanted, all, of, china, to, be, under, the, rule, of, the, puppet, wang, jingwei, and, planned, to, buy, macau, and, east, timor, from, portugal, and, to, create, new, puppet, kingdoms, in, burma, cambodia, vietnam, laos, thailand, indonesia, and, malaya, as, the, burmese, had, proved, to, be, enthusiastic, collaborators, in, the, new, order, in, asia, the, new, burmese, kingdom, would, be, allowed, to, annex, much, of, north, east, india, as, a, reward, the, navy, for, its, part, demanded, that, japan, take, new, caledonia, fiji, and, samoa, while, tojo, was, prime, minister, the, main, forum, for, military, decision, making, was, the, imperial, general, headquarters, presided, over, by, the, emperor, it, consisted, of, the, army, and, navy, ministers, the, army, and, navy, chiefs, of, staff, and, chiefs, of, the, military, affairs, bureaus, in, both, services, the, imperial, ghq, was, not, a, joint, chiefs, of, staff, as, existed, in, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, but, rather, two, separate, services, command, operating, under, the, same, roof, who, would, meet, about, twice, a, week, to, attempt, to, agree, on, a, common, strategy, the, operations, bureaus, of, the, army, and, navy, would, develop, their, own, plans, and, then, attempt, to, sell, them, to, the, other, which, was, often, not, possible, tojo, was, one, voice, out, of, many, speaking, at, the, imperial, ghq, and, was, not, able, to, impose, his, will, on, the, navy, with, which, he, had, to, negotiate, as, if, he, were, dealing, with, an, ally, the, american, historian, stanley, falk, described, the, japanese, system, as, characterized, by, bitter, inter, service, antagonisms, as, the, army, and, navy, worked, at, cross, purposes, observing, the, japanese, system, of, command, was, uncoordinated, ill, defined, and, inefficient, however, after, the, battle, of, midway, with, the, tide, of, war, turning, against, japan, tojo, faced, increasing, opposition, within, the, government, and, military, in, august, september, 1942, a, major, crisis, gripped, the, tojo, cabinet, when, the, foreign, minister, shigenori, t, g, objected, quite, violently, on, august, 29, 1942, to, the, prime, minister, s, plan, to, establish, a, greater, east, asia, ministry, to, handle, relations, with, the, puppet, regimes, in, asia, as, an, insult, to, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, the, gaimusho, and, threatened, to, resign, in, protest, tojo, went, to, see, the, emperor, who, backed, the, prime, minister, s, plans, for, the, greater, east, asia, ministry, and, on, september, 1, 1942, tojo, told, the, cabinet, he, was, establishing, the, greater, east, asia, ministry, and, could, not, care, less, about, how, the, gaimusho, felt, about, the, issue, which, led, t, g, to, resign, in, protest, the, american, historian, herbert, bix, wrote, that, tojo, was, a, dictator, only, in, the, narrow, sense, that, from, september, 1942, on, he, was, generally, able, to, impose, his, will, on, the, cabinet, without, seeking, a, consensus, but, at, the, same, time, noted, that, tojo, s, authority, was, based, upon, the, support, of, the, emperor, who, held, ultimate, power, in, november, 1942, tojo, as, army, minister, was, involved, in, drafting, the, regulations, for, taking, comfort, women, from, china, japan, which, included, taiwan, and, korea, at, this, time, and, manchukuo, to, the, south, as, the, japanese, called, their, conquests, in, south, east, asia, to, ensure, that, the, comfort, women, had, the, proper, papers, before, departing, until, then, the, war, ministry, required, special, permission, to, take, comfort, women, without, papers, and, tojo, was, tired, of, dealing, with, these, requests, at, the, same, time, tojo, as, the, army, minister, became, involved, in, a, clash, with, the, army, chief, of, staff, over, whether, to, continue, the, battle, of, guadalcanal, or, not, tojo, sacked, the, operations, office, and, his, deputy, at, the, general, staff, who, were, opposed, to, withdrawing, and, ordered, the, abandonment, of, the, island, in, september, 1943, the, emperor, and, tojo, agreed, that, japan, would, pull, back, to, an, absolute, defense, line, in, the, south, west, pacific, to, stem, the, american, advance, and, considered, abandoning, rabaul, base, but, changed, their, minds, in, face, of, objections, from, the, navy, in, november, 1943, the, american, public, s, reaction, to, the, battle, of, tarawa, led, tojo, to, view, tarawa, as, a, sort, of, japanese, victory, believing, that, more, battles, like, tarawa, would, break, american, morale, and, force, the, u, s, to, sue, for, peace, moreover, tojo, believed, that, the, americans, would, become, bogged, down, in, the, marshalls, giving, more, time, to, strengthen, the, defenses, in, the, marianas, in, late, 1943, with, the, support, of, the, emperor, tojo, made, a, major, effort, to, make, peace, with, china, to, free, up, the, 2, million, japanese, soldiers, in, china, for, operations, elsewhere, but, the, unwillingness, of, the, japanese, to, give, up, any, of, their, rights, and, interests, in, china, doomed, the, effort, china, was, by, far, the, largest, theater, of, operations, for, japan, and, with, the, americans, steadily, advancing, in, the, pacific, tojo, was, anxious, to, end, the, quagmire, of, the, china, affair, to, redeploy, japanese, forces, in, an, attempt, to, enlist, support, from, all, of, asia, especially, china, tojo, opened, the, greater, east, asia, conference, in, november, 1943, which, issued, a, set, of, pan, asian, war, aims, which, made, little, impression, on, most, asians, on, january, 9, 1944, japan, signed, a, treaty, with, the, puppet, wang, regime, under, which, japan, gave, up, its, extraterritorial, rights, in, china, as, part, of, a, bid, to, win, chinese, public, opinion, over, to, a, pro, japanese, viewpoint, but, as, the, treaty, changed, nothing, in, practice, the, gambit, failed, at, the, same, time, as, he, sought, a, diplomatic, effort, to, end, the, war, with, china, tojo, also, approved, of, the, planning, for, operation, ichi, go, a, huge, offensive, against, china, intended, to, take, the, american, air, bases, in, china, and, finally, knock, china, out, of, the, war, once, and, for, all, in, january, 1944, tojo, approved, of, orders, issued, by, imperial, general, headquarters, for, an, invasion, of, india, where, the, burma, area, army, in, burma, under, general, masakazu, kawabe, was, to, seize, the, manipour, and, assam, provinces, with, the, aim, of, cutting, off, american, aid, to, china, the, railroad, that, supplied, the, american, air, bases, in, north, east, india, that, allowed, for, supplies, to, be, flown, over, the, hump, of, the, himalayas, to, china, passed, through, these, provinces, cutting, off, american, aid, to, china, in, turn, might, have, had, the, effect, of, forcing, chiang, kai, shek, to, sue, for, peace, following, the, 15th, army, into, india, in, the, u, go, offensive, were, the, indian, nationalist, subhas, chandra, bose, and, his, indian, national, army, as, the, political, purpose, of, the, operation, was, to, provoke, a, general, uprising, against, british, rule, in, india, that, might, allow, the, japanese, to, take, all, of, india, the, roads, necessary, to, properly, supply, the, 150, 000, japanese, soldiers, committed, to, invading, india, would, turn, into, mud, when, the, monsoons, arrived, giving, the, japanese, a, very, short, period, of, time, to, break, through, the, japanese, were, counting, on, capturing, food, from, the, british, to, feed, their, army, assuming, that, all, of, india, would, rise, up, when, the, japanese, arrived, and, thereby, cause, the, collapse, of, the, raj, the, japanese, brought, along, with, them, enough, food, to, last, for, only, 20, days, after, that, they, would, have, to, capture, food, from, the, british, to, avoid, starving, bose, had, impressed, tojo, at, their, meetings, as, the, best, man, to, inspire, an, anti, british, revolution, in, india, in, the, central, pacific, the, americans, destroyed, the, main, japanese, naval, base, at, truk, in, an, air, raid, on, february, 18, 1944, forcing, the, imperial, navy, back, to, the, marianas, the, oil, to, fuel, ships, and, planes, operating, in, the, marshalls, caroline, and, gilbert, islands, went, up, in, smoke, at, truk, this, breach, of, the, absolute, defense, line, five, months, after, its, creation, led, tojo, to, fire, admiral, osami, nagano, as, the, navy, chief, of, staff, for, incompetence, the, americans, had, penetrated, 2, 100, km, 1, 300, miles, beyond, the, absolute, defense, line, at, truk, and, tojo, senior, generals, and, admirals, all, blamed, each, other, for, the, situation, to, strengthen, his, position, in, face, of, criticism, of, the, way, the, war, was, going, on, february, 21, 1944, tojo, assumed, the, post, of, chief, of, the, imperial, japanese, army, general, staff, arguing, he, needed, to, take, personal, charge, of, the, army, when, field, marshal, sugiyama, complained, to, the, emperor, about, being, fired, and, having, the, prime, minister, run, the, general, staff, the, emperor, told, him, he, supported, tojo, tojo, s, major, concern, as, army, chief, of, staff, was, planning, the, operations, in, china, and, india, with, less, time, given, over, to, the, coming, battles, in, the, marianas, tojo, decided, to, take, the, strategic, offensive, for, 1944, with, his, plans, to, win, the, war, in, 1944, being, as, follows, tojo, expected, that, a, major, american, defeat, in, the, marianas, combined, with, the, conquest, of, china, and, india, would, so, stun, the, americans, that, they, would, sue, for, peace, by, this, point, tojo, no, longer, believed, the, war, aims, of, 1942, could, be, achieved, but, he, believed, that, his, plans, for, victory, in, 1944, would, lead, to, a, compromise, peace, that, he, could, present, as, a, victory, to, the, japanese, people, by, serving, as, prime, minister, army, minister, and, army, chief, of, staff, tojo, took, on, nearly, all, of, the, responsibility, if, plans, for, victory, in, 1944, failed, he, would, have, no, scapegoat, on, march, 12, 1944, the, japanese, launched, the, u, go, offensive, and, invaded, india, tojo, had, some, doubts, about, operation, u, go, but, it, was, ordered, by, the, emperor, himself, and, tojo, was, unwilling, to, oppose, any, decision, of, the, emperor, despite, the, japanese, pan, asian, rhetoric, and, claim, to, be, liberating, india, the, indian, people, did, not, revolt, and, the, indian, soldiers, of, the, 14th, army, stayed, loyal, to, their, british, officers, and, the, invasion, of, india, ended, in, complete, disaster, the, japanese, were, defeated, by, the, anglo, indian, 14th, army, at, the, battles, of, imphal, and, kohima, on, july, 5, 1944, the, emperor, accepted, tojo, s, advice, to, end, the, invasion, of, india, as, 72, 000, japanese, soldiers, had, been, killed, in, battle, a, similar, number, had, starved, to, death, or, died, of, diseases, as, the, logistics, to, support, an, invasion, of, india, were, lacking, once, the, monsoons, turned, the, roads, of, burma, into, impassable, mud, of, the, 150, 000, japanese, soldiers, who, had, participated, in, the, march, invasion, of, india, most, were, dead, by, july, 1944, in, parallel, with, the, invasion, of, india, in, april, 1944, tojo, began, operation, ichigo, the, largest, japanese, offensive, of, the, entire, war, with, the, aim, of, taking, southern, china, in, the, battle, of, saipan, about, 70, 000, japanese, soldiers, sailors, and, civilians, were, killed, in, june, july, 1944, and, in, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, the, imperial, navy, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, june, 19, 1944, was, dubbed, by, the, americans, the, great, marianas, turkey, shoot, as, over, the, course, of, the, dogfights, in, the, air, the, us, navy, lost, 30, planes, while, shooting, down, about, 350, imperial, japanese, planes, in, one, of, the, imperial, navy, s, most, humiliating, defeats, the, japanese, believed, that, indoctrination, in, bushido, the, way, of, the, warrior, would, give, them, the, edge, as, the, japanese, longed, to, die, for, the, emperor, while, the, americans, were, afraid, to, die, but, superior, american, pilot, training, and, airplanes, meant, the, japanese, were, hopelessly, outclassed, by, the, americans, with, saipan, in, american, hands, the, americans, could, take, other, islands, in, the, marianas, to, build, airbases, the, establishment, of, american, bases, in, the, marianas, meant, the, cities, of, japan, were, within, the, range, of, b, 29, superfortress, bombers, and, the, british, historian, h, p, willmott, noted, that, even, the, most, hard, headed, of, the, japanese, militarists, could, dimly, perceive, that, japan, would, be, at, the, end, of, her, tether, in, that, case, as, the, news, of, the, disastrous, defeat, suffered, at, saipan, reached, japan, it, turned, elite, opinion, against, the, tojo, government, the, emperor, himself, was, furious, about, the, defeat, at, saipan, had, called, a, meeting, of, the, board, of, field, marshals, and, fleet, admirals, to, consider, whether, it, might, be, possible, to, recapture, saipan, and, prince, takamatsu, wrote, in, his, diary, he, flares, up, frequently, tojo, was, the, prime, minister, minister, of, the, army, and, chief, of, the, army, general, staff, and, was, seen, both, in, japan, and, in, the, us, as, in, words, of, willmott, the, embodiment, of, national, determination, hardline, nationalism, and, militarism, prince, konoe, and, admiral, okada, had, been, plotting, to, bring, down, the, tojo, government, since, the, spring, of, 1943, and, their, principal, problem, had, been, the, support, of, the, emperor, who, did, not, wish, to, lose, his, favorite, prime, minister, after, the, battle, of, saipan, it, was, clear, to, at, least, some, of, the, japanese, elite, that, the, war, was, lost, and, japan, needed, to, make, peace, before, the, kokutai, and, perhaps, even, the, chrysanthemum, throne, itself, was, destroyed, tojo, had, been, so, demonized, in, the, united, states, during, the, war, that, for, the, american, people, tojo, was, the, face, of, japanese, militarism, and, it, was, inconceivable, that, the, united, states, would, make, peace, with, a, government, headed, by, tojo, willmott, noted, that, an, additional, problem, for, the, peace, faction, was, that, tojo, was, an, embodiment, of, mainstream, opinion, within, the, nation, the, armed, services, and, particularly, the, army, tojo, had, powerful, support, and, by, japanese, standards, he, was, not, extreme, tojo, was, more, of, a, follower, than, a, leader, and, he, represented, mainstream, opinion, in, the, army, and, so, his, removal, from, office, would, not, mean, the, end, of, the, political, ambitions, of, an, army, still, fanatically, committed, to, victory, or, death, the, jushin, elder, statesmen, had, advised, the, emperor, that, tojo, needed, to, go, after, saipan, and, further, advised, the, emperor, against, partial, changes, in, the, cabinet, demanding, that, the, entire, tojo, cabinet, resign, tojo, aware, of, the, intrigues, to, bring, him, down, had, sought, the, public, approval, of, the, emperor, which, was, denied, the, emperor, sent, him, a, message, to, the, effect, that, the, man, responsible, for, the, disaster, of, saipan, was, not, worthy, of, his, approval, tojo, suggested, reorganizing, his, cabinet, to, regain, imperial, approval, but, was, rebuffed, again, the, emperor, said, the, entire, cabinet, had, to, go, once, it, was, clear, that, tojo, no, longer, had, the, support, of, the, chrysanthemum, throne, tojo, s, enemies, had, little, trouble, bringing, down, his, government, the, politically, powerful, lord, privy, seal, marquis, k, ichi, kido, spread, the, word, that, the, emperor, no, longer, supported, tojo, after, the, fall, of, saipan, he, was, forced, to, resign, on, july, 18, 1944, as, tojo, s, replacement, the, jushin, advised, the, emperor, to, appoint, a, former, prime, minister, admiral, mitsumasa, yonai, as, he, was, popular, among, the, navy, the, diplomatic, corps, the, bureaucracy, and, the, peace, faction, however, yonai, refused, to, serve, fearing, that, a, prime, minister, who, attempted, to, make, peace, with, the, americans, might, be, assassinated, as, many, army, officers, were, still, committed, to, victory, or, death, and, regarded, any, talk, of, peace, as, treason, he, stated, that, only, another, general, could, serve, as, prime, minister, and, recommended, general, kuniaki, koiso, in, his, place, at, a, conference, with, the, emperor, koiso, and, yonai, were, told, to, co, operate, in, forming, a, new, government, but, not, told, which, of,
