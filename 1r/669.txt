of, the, colombian, government, because, many, of, the, political, candidates, whom, they, backed, financially, were, eventually, elected, although, the, medell, n, cartel, was, only, established, in, the, early, 1970s, it, expanded, after, escobar, met, several, drug, lords, on, a, farm, in, april, 1978, and, by, the, end, of, 1978, they, had, transported, some, 19, 000, kilograms, of, cocaine, to, the, united, states, soon, the, demand, for, cocaine, greatly, increased, in, the, united, states, which, led, to, escobar, organizing, more, smuggling, shipments, routes, and, distribution, networks, in, south, florida, california, puerto, rico, and, other, parts, of, the, country, he, and, cartel, co, founder, carlos, lehder, worked, together, to, develop, a, new, trans, shipment,

brother, escobar, did, not, purchase, norman, s, cay, it, was, instead, a, sole, venture, of, lehder, s, from, 1978, to, 1982, this, was, used, as, a, central, smuggling, route, for, the, medell, n, cartel, with, the, enormous, profits, generated, by, this, route, escobar, was, soon, able, to, purchase, 20, square, kilometres, 7, 7, sq, mi, of, land, in, antioquia, for, several, million, dollars, on, which, he, built, the, hacienda, n, poles, the, luxury, house, he, created, contained, a, zoo, a, lake, a, sculpture, garden, a, private, bullring, and, other, amenities, for, his, family, and,

was, automatically, granted, parliamentary, immunity, and, the, right, to, a, diplomatic, passport, under, colombian, law, at, the, same, time, escobar, was, gradually, becoming, a, public, figure, and, because, of, his, charitable, work, he, was, known, as, robin, hood, paisa, he, alleged, once, in, an, interview, that, his, fortune, came, from, a, bicycle, rental, company, he, founded, when, he, was, 16, years, old, in, congress, the, new, minister, of, justice, rodrigo, lara, bonilla, had, become, escobar, s, opponent, accusing, escobar, of, criminal, activity, from, the, first, day, of, congress, escobar, s, arrest, in, 1976, was, investigated, by, lara, bonilla, s, subordinates, a, few, months, later, liberal, leader, luis, carlos, gal, n, expelled, escobar, from, the, party,

illegal, due, to, being, signed, by, a, presidential, delegation, not, the, president, escobar, s, victory, over, the, judiciary, was, short, lived, with, new, president, virgilio, barco, vargas, having, quickly, renewed, his, agreement, with, the, united, states, escobar, still, held, a, grudge, against, luis, carlos, gal, n, for, kicking, him, out, of, politics, so, gal, n, was, assassinated, on, 18, august, 1989, at, escobar, s, orders, escobar, then, planted, a, bomb, on, avianca, flight, 203, in, an, attempt, to, assassinate, gal, n, s, successor, c, sar, gaviria,

while, in, prison, began, to, surface, in, the, media, which, prompted, the, government, to, attempt, to, move, him, to, a, more, conventional, jail, on, 22, july, 1992, escobar, s, influence, allowed, him, to, discover, the, plan, in, advance, and, make, a, successful, escape, spending, the, remainder, of, his, life, evading, the, police, escobar, faced, threats, from, the, colombian,
