confidential, an, a, e, network, series, produced, an, episode, about, the, murder, postulating, that, part, of, the, reason, miller, took, such, an, active, interest, including, supporting, reilly, s, defense, and, using, his, own, celebrity, to, bring, attention, to, reilly, s, plight, was, because, he, had, felt, similarly, persecuted, in, his, run, ins, with, the, huac, he, sympathized, with,
