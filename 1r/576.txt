stars, never, admitted, these, things, in, its, lyrics, the, album, was, regarded, as, an, inspired, culmination, of, her, early, work, with, depressed, assessments, of, the, world, around, her, serving, as, counterpoint, to, exuberant, expressions, of, romantic, love, for, example, in, california, mitchell, later, remarked, at, that, period, of, my, life, i, had, no, personal, defenses, i, felt, like, a, cellophane, wrapper, on, a, pack, of, cigarettes, i, felt, like, i, had, absolutely, no, secrets, from, the, world, and, i, couldn, t, pretend, in, my, life, to, be, strong, mitchell,

she, drove, back, to, california, alone, and, composed, several, songs, during, her, journey, which, featured, on, her, next, album, 1976, s, hejira, she, stated, that, this, album, was, written, mostly, while, i, was, traveling, in, the, car, that, s, why, there, were, no, piano, songs, hejira, was, arguably, mitchell, s, most, experimental, album, so, far, owing, to, her, ongoing, collaborations, with, jazz, virtuoso, bass, guitarist, jaco, pastorius, on, several, songs, namely, the, first, single, coyote, the, atmospheric, hejira, the, disorienting, guitar, heavy, black, crow, and, the, album, s, last, song, refuge, of, the, roads, the, album, climbed, to, no, 13, on, the, billboard, charts, reaching, gold, status, three, weeks, after, release, and, received, airplay, from, album, oriented, fm, rock, stations, yet, coyote, backed, with, blue, motel, room, failed, to, chart, on, the, hot, 100, hejira, did, not, sell, as, briskly, as, mitchell, s, earlier, more, radio, friendly, albums, its, stature, in, her, catalogue, has, grown, over, the, years, mitchell, herself, believes, the, album, to, be, unique, in, 2006, she, said, i, suppose, a, lot, of, people, could, have, written, a, lot, of, my, other, songs, but, i, feel, the, songs, on, hejira, could, only, have, come, from, me, in, mid, 1977, mitchell, began, work, on, new, recordings, that, became, her, first, double, studio, album, don, juan, s, reckless, daughter, close, to, completing, her, contract, with, asylum, records, mitchell, felt, that, this, album, could, be, looser, in, feel, than, any, album, she, had, done, in, the, past, she, invited, pastorius, back, and, he, brought, with, him, fellow, members, of, jazz, fusion, pioneers, weather, report, including, drummer, don, alias, and, saxophonist, wayne, shorter, layered, atmospheric, compositions, such, as, overture, cotton, avenue, featured, more, improvisatory, collaboration, while, paprika, plains, was, a, 16, minute, epic, that, stretched, the, boundaries, of, pop, owing, more, to, mitchell, s, memories, of, childhood, in, canada, and, her, study, of, classical, music, dreamland, and, the, tenth, world, featuring, chaka, khan, on, backing, vocals, were, percussion, dominated, tracks, other, songs, continued, the, jazz, rock, folk, collisions, of, hejira, mitchell, also, revived, jericho, written, years, earlier, a, version, is, found, on, her, 1974, live, album, but, never, recorded, in, a, studio, setting, the, album, was, released, in, december, 1977, receiving, mixed, reviews, but, selling, relatively, well, peaking, at, no, 25, in, the, us, and, going, gold, within, three, months, mitchell, wore, blackface, and, a, pimp, outfit, on, the, album, cover, one, of, the, most, controversial, moments, of, her, career, that, has, been, widely, criticised, as, racist, she, called, her, blackface, alter, ego, art, nouveau, inspired, by, a, black, man, who, once, complimented, her, while, walking, down, an, la, street, she, wore, blackface, several, more, times, throughout, her, career, and, has, consistently, defended, her, use, of, it, as, late, as, 2017, however, in, 2024, the, album, cover, art, on, streaming, services, and, physical, reissues, was, changed, to, a, photo, of, mitchell, with, a, dog, no, announcement, was, made, about, the, change, nor, any, official, reason, given, and, mitchell, has, not, commented, on, the, matter, a, few, months, after, the, release, of, don, juan, s, reckless, daughter, mitchell, was, contacted, by, the, esteemed, jazz, composer, bandleader, and, bassist, charles, mingus, who, had, heard, the, orchestrated, song, paprika, plains, and, wanted, her, to, work, with, him, she, began, a, collaboration, with, mingus, who, died, before, the, project, was, completed, in, 1979, she, finished, the, tracks, and, the, resulting, album, mingus, was, released, in, june, 1979, though, it, was, poorly, received, in, the, press, fans, were, confused, over, such, a, major, change, in, mitchell, s, overall, sound, and, though, the, album, topped, out, at, no, 17, on, the, billboard, albums, chart, a, higher, placement, than, don, juan, s, reckless, daughter, mingus, still, fell, short, of, gold, status, making, it, her, first, album, since, the, 1960s, not, to, sell, at, least, half, a, million, copies, mitchell, s, tour, to, promote, mingus, began, in, august, 1979, in, oklahoma, city, and, concluded, six, weeks, later, with, five, shows, at, los, angeles, greek, theatre, and, one, at, the, santa, barbara, county,

her, friend, david, geffen, founder, of, asylum, records, decided, to, start, a, new, label, geffen, records, still, distributed, by, warner, bros, who, controlled, asylum, records, geffen, negated,

she, received, a, suggestion, from, geffen, that, perhaps, an, outside, producer, with, experience, in, the, modern, technical, arenas, that, they, wanted, to, explore, might, be, a, worthy, addition, mitchell, hired, the, british, synthpop, musician, thomas, dolby, to, assist, with, synthesizers, and, production, but, found, working, with, him, difficult, i, was, reluctant, when, thomas, was, suggested, because, he, had, been, asked, to, produce, the, record, and, would, he, consider, coming, in, as, just, a, programmer, and, a, player, so, on, that, level, we, did, have, some, problems, he, may, be, able, to, do, it, faster, he, may, be, able, to, do, it, better, but, the, fact, is, that, it, then, wouldn, t, really, be, my, music, dog, eat, dog, released, in, october, 1985, was,

most, accessible, set, of, songs, in, years, songs, such, as, sex, kills, sunny, sunday, borderline, and, the, magdalene, laundries, mixed, social, commentary, and, guitar, focused, melodies, for, a, startling, comeback, the, album, won, two, grammy, awards, including, best, pop, album, and, it, coincided, with, a, much, publicized, resurgence, in, interest, in, mitchell, s, work, by, a, younger, generation, of, singer, songwriters, in, 1996, mitchell, agreed, to, release, a, greatest, hits, collection, despite, initial, concerns, that, such, a, release, would, damage, sales, of, her, catalog,

tunings, without, having, to, re, tune, the, guitar, the, guitar, s, output, through, the, vg, 8, was, transposed, to, any, of, her, tunings, in, real, time, it, was, around, this, time, that, critics, also, began, to, notice, a, real, change, in, mitchell, s, voice, particularly, on, her, older, songs, the, singer, later, confirmed, the, change, explaining, that, i, d, go, to, hit, a, note, and, there, was, nothing, there, while, her, more, limited, range, and, huskier, vocals, have, sometimes, been, attributed, to, her, smoking, she, was, described, by, journalist, robin, eggar, as, one, of, the, world, s, last, great, smokers, mitchell, believes, that, the, changes, in, her, voice, that, became, noticeable, in, the, 1990s, were, because, of, other, problems, including, vocal, nodules, a, compressed, larynx, and, the, lingering, effects, of, having, had, polio, in, an, interview, in, 2004, she, denied, that, my, terrible, habits, had, anything, to, do, with, her, more, limited, range, and, pointed, out, that, singers, often, lose, the, upper, register, when, they, pass, fifty, in, addition, she, contended, that, her, voice, had, acquired, a, more, interesting, and, expressive, alto, range, when, she, could, no, longer, hit, the, high, notes, let, alone, hold, them, as, she, had, in, her, youth, the, singer, s, next, two, albums, featured, no, new, songs, and, mitchell, has, said, were, recorded, to, fulfill, contractual, obligations, but, on, both, she, attempted, to, make, use, of, her, new, vocal, range, in, interpreting, familiar, material, both,

contained, remakes, of, a, case, of, you, and, the, title, track, both, sides, now, two, early, hits, transposed, down, to, mitchell, s, new, dusky, soulful, alto, range, it, received, mostly, strong, reviews, and, motivated, a, short, national, tour, with, mitchell, accompanied, by, a, core, band, featuring, her, ex, husband, larry, klein, on, bass, plus, a, local, orchestra, on, each, tour, stop,
