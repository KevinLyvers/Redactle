georges, pierre, seurat, uk, s, r, sur, ah, us, s, r, suu, rah, french, 2, december, 1859, 29, march, 1891, was, a, french, post, impressionist, artist, he, devised, the, painting, techniques, known, as, chromoluminarism, and, pointillism, and, used, cont, crayon, for, drawings, on, paper, with, a, rough, surface, seurat, s, artistic, personality, combined, qualities, that, are, usually, thought, of, as, opposed, and, incompatible, on, the, one, hand, his, extreme, and, delicate, sensibility, on, the, other, a, passion, for, logical, abstraction, and, an, almost, mathematical, precision, of, mind, his, large, scale, work, a, sunday, afternoon, on, the, island, of, la, grande, jatte, 1884, 1886, altered, the, direction, of, modern, art, by, initiating, neo, impressionism, and, is, one, of, the, icons, of, late, 19th, century, painting, seurat, was, born, on, 2, december, 1859, in, paris, at, 60, rue, de, bondy, now, rue, ren, boulanger, the, seurat, family, moved, to, 136, boulevard, de, magenta, now, 110, boulevard, de, magenta, in, 1862, or, 1863, his, father, antoine, chrysostome, seurat, originally, from, champagne, was, a, former, legal, official, who, had, become, wealthy, from, speculating, in, property, and, his, mother, ernestine, faivre, was, from, paris, georges, had, a, brother, mile, augustin, and, a, sister, marie, berthe, both, older, his, father, lived, in, le, raincy, and, visited, his, wife, and, children, once, a, week, at, boulevard, de, magenta, georges, seurat, first, studied, art, at, the, cole, municipale, de, sculpture, et, dessin, near, his, family, s, home, in, the, boulevard, magenta, which, was, run, by, the, sculptor, justin, lequien, in, 1878, he, moved, on, to, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, where, he, was, taught, by, henri, lehmann, and, followed, a, conventional, academic, training, drawing, from, casts, of, antique, sculpture, and, copying, drawings, by, old, masters, seurat, s, studies, resulted, in, a, well, considered, and, fertile, theory, of, contrasts, a, theory, to, which, all, his, work, was, thereafter, subjected, his, formal, artistic, education, came, to, an, end, in, november, 1879, when, he, left, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, for, a, year, of, military, service, after, a, year, at, the, brest, military, academy, he, returned, to, paris, where, he, shared, a, studio, with, his, friend, aman, jean, while, also, renting, a, small, apartment, at, 16, rue, de, chabrol, for, the, next, two, years, he, worked, at, mastering, the, art, of, monochrome, drawing, his, first, exhibited, work, shown, at, the, salon, of, 1883, was, a, cont, crayon, drawing, of, aman, jean, he, also, studied, the, works, of, eug, ne, delacroix, carefully, making, notes, on, his, use, of, color, he, spent, 1883, working, on, his, first, major, painting, a, large, canvas, titled, bathers, at, asni, res, a, monumental, work, showing, young, men, relaxing, by, the, seine, in, a, working, class, suburb, of, paris, although, influenced, in, its, use, of, color, and, light, tone, by, impressionism, the, painting, with, its, smooth, simplified, textures, and, carefully, outlined, rather, sculptural, figures, shows, the, continuing, impact, of, his, neoclassical, training, the, critic, paul, alexis, described, it, as, a, faux, puvis, de, chavannes, seurat, also, departed, from, the, impressionist, ideal, by, preparing, for, the, work, with, a, number, of, drawings, and, oil, sketches, before, starting, on, the, canvas, in, his, studio, bathers, at, asni, res, was, rejected, by, the, paris, salon, and, instead, he, showed, it, at, the, groupe, des, artistes, ind, pendants, in, may, 1884, soon, however, disillusioned, by, the, poor, organization, of, the, ind, pendants, seurat, and, some, other, artists, he, had, met, through, the, group, including, charles, angrand, henri, edmond, cross, albert, dubois, pillet, and, paul, signac, set, up, a, new, organization, the, soci, t, des, artistes, ind, pendants, seurat, s, new, ideas, on, pointillism, were, to, have, an, especially, strong, influence, on, signac, who, subsequently, painted, in, the, same, idiom, in, summer, 1884, seurat, began, work, on, a, sunday, afternoon, on, the, island, of, la, grande, jatte, the, painting, shows, members, of, each, of, the, social, classes, participating, in, various, park, activities, the, tiny, juxtaposed, dots, of, multi, colored, paint, allow, the, viewer, s, eye, to, blend, colors, optically, rather, than, having, the, colors, physically, blended, on, the, canvas, it, took, seurat, two, years, to, complete, this, 10, foot, wide, 3, 0, m, painting, much, of, which, he, spent, in, the, park, sketching, in, preparation, for, the, work, there, are, about, 60, studies, for, the, large, painting, including, a, smaller, version, study, for, a, sunday, afternoon, on, the, island, of, la, grande, jatte, 1884, 1885, which, is, now, in, the, collection, of, the, art, institute, of, chicago, the, full, work, is, also, part, of, the, permanent, collection, of, the, art, institute, of, chicago, the, painting, was, the, inspiration, for, james, lapine, and, stephen, sondheim, s, musical, sunday, in, the, park, with, george, and, played, a, significant, symbolic, role, in, john, hughes, ferris, bueller, s, day, off, seurat, concealed, his, relationship, with, madeleine, knobloch, or, madeleine, knoblock, 1868, 1903, an, artist, s, model, whom, he, portrayed, in, his, painting, jeune, femme, se, poudrant, in, 1889, she, moved, in, with, seurat, in, his, studio, on, the, seventh, floor, of, 128, bis, boulevard, de, clichy, when, madeleine, became, pregnant, the, couple, moved, to, a, studio, at, 39, passage, de, l, lys, e, des, beaux, arts, now, rue, andr, antoine, there, she, gave, birth, to, their, son, who, was, named, pierre, georges, on, 16, february, 1890, seurat, spent, the, summer, of, 1890, on, the, coast, at, gravelines, where, he, painted, four, canvases, including, the, channel, of, gravelines, petit, fort, philippe, as, well, as, eight, oil, panels, and, made, a, few, drawings, seurat, died, in, paris, in, his, parents, home, on, 29, march, 1891, at, the, age, of, 31, the, cause, of, his, death, is, uncertain, and, has, been, variously, attributed, to, a, form, of, meningitis, pneumonia, infectious, angina, and, diphtheria, his, son, died, two, weeks, later, from, the, same, disease, his, last, ambitious, work, the, circus, was, left, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, on, 30, march, 1891, a, commemorative, service, was, held, in, the, church, of, saint, vincent, de, paul, seurat, was, interred, 31, march, 1891, at, cimeti, re, du, p, re, lachaise, at, the, time, of, seurat, s, death, madeleine, was, pregnant, with, a, second, child, who, died, during, or, shortly, after, birth, during, the, 19th, century, scientist, writers, such, as, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, ogden, rood, and, david, sutter, wrote, treatises, on, colour, optical, effects, and, perception, they, adapted, the, scientific, research, of, hermann, von, helmholtz, and, isaac, newton, into, a, form, accessible, to, laypeople, artists, followed, new, discoveries, in, perception, with, great, interest, chevreul, was, perhaps, the, most, important, influence, on, artists, at, the, time, his, great, contribution, was, producing, a, colour, wheel, of, primary, and, intermediary, hues, chevreul, was, a, french, chemist, who, restored, tapestries, during, his, restorations, he, noticed, that, the, only, way, to, restore, a, section, properly, was, to, take, into, account, the, influence, of, the, colours, around, the, missing, wool, he, could, not, produce, the, right, hue, unless, he, recognized, the, surrounding, dyes, chevreul, discovered, that, two, colours, juxtaposed, slightly, overlapping, or, very, close, together, would, have, the, effect, of, another, colour, when, seen, from, a, distance, the, discovery, of, this, phenomenon, became, the, basis, for, the, pointillist, technique, of, the, neo, impressionist, painters, chevreul, also, realized, that, the, halo, that, one, sees, after, looking, at, a, colour, is, the, opposing, colour, also, known, as, complementary, color, for, example, after, looking, at, a, red, object, one, may, see, a, cyan, echo, halo, of, the, original, object, this, complementary, colour, as, an, example, cyan, for, red, is, due, to, retinal, persistence, neo, impressionist, painters, interested, in, the, interplay, of, colours, made, extensive, use, of, complementary, colors, in, their, paintings, in, his, works, chevreul, advised, artists, to, think, and, paint, not, just, the, colour, of, the, central, object, but, to, add, colours, and, make, appropriate, adjustments, to, achieve, a, harmony, among, colours, it, seems, that, the, harmony, chevreul, wrote, about, is, what, seurat, came, to, call, emotion, it, is, not, clear, whether, seurat, read, all, of, chevreul, s, book, on, colour, contrast, published, in, 1859, but, he, did, copy, out, several, paragraphs, from, the, chapter, on, painting, and, he, had, read, charles, blanc, s, grammaire, des, arts, du, dessin, 1867, which, cites, chevreul, s, work, blanc, s, book, was, directed, at, artists, and, art, connoisseurs, because, of, colour, s, emotional, significance, to, him, he, made, explicit, recommendations, that, were, close, to, the, theories, later, adopted, by, the, neo, impressionists, he, said, that, colour, should, not, be, based, on, the, judgment, of, taste, but, rather, it, should, be, close, to, what, we, experience, in, reality, blanc, did, not, want, artists, to, use, equal, intensities, of, colour, but, to, consciously, plan, and, understand, the, role, of, each, hue, in, creating, a, whole, while, chevreul, based, his, theories, on, newton, s, thoughts, on, the, mixing, of, light, ogden, rood, based, his, writings, on, the, work, of, helmholtz, he, analyzed, the, effects, of, mixing, and, juxtaposing, material, pigments, rood, valued, as, primary, colors, red, green, and, blue, violet, like, chevreul, he, said, that, if, two, colours, are, placed, next, to, each, other, from, a, distance, they, look, like, a, third, distinctive, colour, he, also, pointed, out, that, the, juxtaposition, of, primary, hues, next, to, each, other, would, create, a, far, more, intense, and, pleasing, colour, when, perceived, by, the, eye, and, mind, than, the, corresponding, color, made, simply, by, mixing, paint, rood, advised, artists, to, be, aware, of, the, difference, between, additive, and, subtractive, qualities, of, colour, since, material, pigments, and, optical, pigments, light, do, not, mix, in, the, same, way, seurat, was, also, influenced, by, sutter, s, phenomena, of, vision, 1880, in, which, he, wrote, that, the, laws, of, harmony, can, be, learned, as, one, learns, the, laws, of, harmony, and, music, he, heard, lectures, in, the, 1880s, by, the, mathematician, charles, henry, at, the, sorbonne, who, discussed, the, emotional, properties, and, symbolic, meaning, of, lines, and, colour, there, remains, controversy, over, the, extent, to, which, henry, s, ideas, were, adopted, by, seurat, seurat, took, to, heart, the, colour, theorists, notion, of, a, scientific, approach, to, painting, he, believed, that, a, painter, could, use, colour, to, create, harmony, and, emotion, in, art, in, the, same, way, that, a, musician, uses, counterpoint, and, variation, to, create, harmony, in, music, he, theorized, that, the, scientific, application, of, colour, was, like, any, other, natural, law, and, he, was, driven, to, prove, this, conjecture, he, thought, that, the, knowledge, of, perception, and, optical, laws, could, be, used, to, create, a, new, language, of, art, based, on, its, own, set, of, heuristics, and, he, set, out, to, show, this, language, using, lines, colour, intensity, and, colour, schema, seurat, called, this, language, chromoluminarism, in, a, letter, to, the, writer, maurice, beaubourg, in, 1890, he, wrote, art, is, harmony, harmony, is, the, analogy, of, the, contrary, and, of, similar, elements, of, tone, of, colour, and, of, line, in, tone, lighter, against, darker, in, colour, the, complementary, red, green, orange, blue, yellow, violet, in, line, those, that, form, a, right, angle, the, frame, is, in, a, harmony, that, opposes, those, of, the, tones, colours, and, lines, of, the, picture, these, aspects, are, considered, according, to, their, dominance, and, under, the, influence, of, light, in, gay, calm, or, sad, combinations, seurat, s, theories, can, be, summarized, as, follows, the, emotion, of, gaiety, can, be, achieved, by, the, domination, of, luminous, hues, by, the, predominance, of, warm, colours, and, by, the, use, of, lines, directed, upward, calm, is, achieved, through, an, equivalence, balance, of, the, use, of, the, light, and, the, dark, by, the, balance, of, warm, and, cold, colours, and, by, lines, that, are, horizontal, sadness, is, achieved, by, using, dark, and, cold, colours, and, by, lines, pointing, downward, where, the, dialectic, nature, of, paul, c, zanne, s, work, had, been, greatly, influential, during, the, highly, expressionistic, phase, of, proto, cubism, between, 1908, and, 1910, the, work, of, seurat, with, its, flatter, more, linear, structures, would, capture, the, attention, of, the, cubists, from, 1911, seurat, in, his, few, years, of, activity, was, able, with, his, observations, on, irradiation, and, the, effects, of, contrast, to, create, afresh, without, any, guiding, tradition, to, complete, an, esthetic, system, with, a, new, technical, method, perfectly, adapted, to, its, expression, with, the, advent, of, monochromatic, cubism, in, 1910, 1911, writes, art, historian, robert, herbert, questions, of, form, displaced, color, in, the, artists, attention, and, for, these, seurat, was, more, relevant, thanks, to, several, exhibitions, his, paintings, and, drawings, were, easily, seen, in, paris, and, reproductions, of, his, major, compositions, circulated, widely, among, the, cubists, the, chahut, was, called, by, andr, salmon, one, of, the, great, icons, of, the, new, devotion, and, both, it, and, the, cirque, circus, mus, e, d, orsay, paris, according, to, guillaume, apollinaire, almost, belong, to, synthetic, cubism, the, concept, was, well, established, among, the, french, artists, that, painting, could, be, expressed, mathematically, in, terms, of, both, color, and, form, and, this, mathematical, expression, resulted, in, an, independent, and, compelling, objective, truth, perhaps, more, so, than, the, objective, truth, of, the, object, represented, indeed, the, neo, impressionists, had, succeeded, in, establishing, an, objective, scientific, basis, in, the, domain, of, color, seurat, addresses, both, problems, in, circus, and, dancers, soon, the, cubists, were, to, do, so, in, both, the, domain, of, form, and, dynamics, orphism, would, do, so, with, color, too, on, 2, december, 2021, google, honored, seurat, with, a, google, doodle, on, his, 162nd, birthday, from, 1883, until, his, death, seurat, exhibited, his, work, at, the, salon, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, les, xx, in, brussels, the, eighth, impressionist, exhibition, and, other, exhibitions, in, france, and, abroad, posthumous, exhibitions
