thutmose, iii, variously, also, spelt, tuthmosis, or, thothmes, sometimes, called, thutmose, the, great, was, the, sixth, pharaoh, of, the, 18th, dynasty, officially, he, ruled, egypt, from, 28, april, 1479, bc, until, 11, march, 1425, bc, commencing, with, his, coronation, at, the, age, of, two, and, concluding, with, his, death, aged, fifty, six, however, during, the, first, 22, years, of, his, reign, he, was, coregent, with, his, stepmother, and, aunt, hatshepsut, who, was, named, the, pharaoh, while, he, was, depicted, as, the, first, on, surviving, monuments, both, were, assigned, the, usual, royal, names, and, insignia, and, neither, is, given, any, obvious, seniority, over, the, other, thutmose, served, as, commander, of, hatshepsut, s, armies, during, the, final, two, years, of, his, reign, after, the, death, of, his, firstborn, son, and, heir, amenemhat, he, appointed, his, son, and, successor, amenhotep, ii, as, junior, co, regent, thutmose, iii, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, warriors, military, commanders, and, military, strategists, of, all, time, as, egypt, s, preeminent, warrior, pharaoh, and, conqueror, and, as, a, dominant, figure, in, the, new, kingdom, period, itself, considered, the, height, of, egyptian, power, he, became, sole, ruler, after, hatshepsut, s, death, and, conducted, between, 17, and, 20, campaigns, all, victorious, while, expanding, egypt, s, empire, to, its, largest, extent, he, also, created, the, ancient, egyptian, navy, the, first, combat, navy, in, the, ancient, world, historian, richard, a, gabriel, referred, to, thutmose, iii, as, the, napoleon, of, egypt, numerous, recordings, of, his, military, campaigns, are, detailed, in, the, inscriptions, known, as, the, annals, of, thutmose, iii, thutmose, s, two, main, names, transliterate, as, mn, pr, r, wtj, ms, the, first, name, is, usually, transcribed, as, menkheperre, and, means, the, established, one, of, the, manifestation, of, ra, the, second, name, is, transliterated, as, thutmose, or, tuthmosis, and, means, born, of, thoth, or, thoth, is, born, manetho, in, his, aegyptiaca, history, of, egypt, written, in, greek, and, paraphrased, by, eusebius, called, him, miphr, s, and, misphragmuth, sis, thutmose, iii, was, the, son, of, thutmose, ii, by, a, secondary, wife, iset, or, aset, his, father, s, great, royal, wife, was, hatshepsut, her, daughter, neferure, was, thutmose, s, half, sister, when, thutmose, ii, died, thutmose, iii, was, too, young, to, rule, hatshepsut, became, his, regent, soon, his, co, regent, and, shortly, after, that, declared, herself, pharaoh, while, never, denying, kingship, to, thutmose, iii, during, his, childhood, hatshepsut, ruled, egypt, in, practice, and, name, achieving, prosperity, and, success, when, thutmose, iii, reached, a, suitable, age, and, demonstrated, his, capacity, she, appointed, him, to, head, her, armies, and, at, her, death, he, was, ready, to, rule, some, egyptologists, speculate, that, thutmose, married, his, half, sister, neferure, but, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, neferure, may, have, been, the, mother, of, thutmose, s, firstborn, son, amenemhat, alternatively, the, great, royal, wife, satiah, is, believed, to, have, been, the, mother, of, amenemhat, amenemhat, predeceased, his, father, surviving, records, attest, to, several, other, wives, of, thutmose, he, is, known, to, have, at, least, three, foreign, wives, menhet, menwi, and, merti, who, were, buried, together, at, least, one, other, wife, nebtu, is, known, from, a, pillar, in, thutmose, s, tomb, following, the, death, of, satiah, a, woman, named, merytre, hatshepsut, became, the, great, royal, wife, she, was, the, mother, of, several, of, his, children, including, the, future, king, amenhotep, ii, and, another, son, menkheperre, and, at, least, four, daughters, nebetiunet, meritamen, c, and, d, and, iset, thutmose, iii, reigned, from, 1479, bc, to, 1425, bc, according, to, the, low, chronology, of, ancient, egypt, this, has, been, the, conventional, egyptian, chronology, in, academic, circles, since, the, 1960s, though, in, some, circles, the, older, dates, 1504, bc, to, 1450, bc, are, preferred, from, the, high, chronology, of, egypt, these, dates, just, as, all, the, dates, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, are, open, to, dispute, because, of, uncertainty, about, the, circumstances, surrounding, the, recording, of, a, heliacal, rise, of, sothis, in, the, reign, of, amenhotep, i, a, papyrus, from, amenhotep, i, s, reign, records, this, astronomical, observation, which, theoretically, could, be, used, to, perfectly, correlate, the, egyptian, chronology, with, the, modern, calendar, however, to, do, this, the, latitude, where, the, observation, was, taken, must, also, be, known, this, document, has, no, note, of, the, place, of, observation, but, it, can, safely, be, assumed, that, it, was, taken, in, either, a, delta, city, such, as, memphis, or, heliopolis, or, in, thebes, these, two, latitudes, give, dates, 20, years, apart, the, high, and, low, chronologies, respectively, the, length, of, thutmose, iii, s, reign, is, known, to, the, day, thanks, to, findings, in, the, tomb, of, the, military, commander, amenemheb, mahu, amenemheb, mahu, records, thutmose, iii, s, death, to, his, master, s, 54th, regnal, year, on, the, 30th, day, of, the, third, month, of, peret, the, day, of, thutmose, iii, s, accession, is, known, to, be, i, shemu, day, four, and, astronomical, observations, can, be, used, to, establish, the, exact, dates, of, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, king, s, reign, assuming, the, low, chronology, from, 28, april, 1479, bc, to, 11, march, 1425, bc, respectively, thutmose, iii, conducted, at, least, 16, campaigns, in, 20, years, american, egyptologist, james, breasted, referred, to, him, as, the, napoleon, of, egypt, for, his, conquests, and, expansionism, thutmose, iii, is, recorded, to, have, captured, 350, cities, during, his, rule, and, conquered, much, of, the, near, east, from, the, euphrates, to, nubia, during, seventeen, known, military, campaigns, he, was, the, first, pharaoh, after, thutmose, i, to, cross, the, euphrates, doing, so, during, his, campaign, against, mitanni, his, campaign, records, were, inscribed, onto, the, walls, of, the, temple, of, amun, at, karnak, transcribed, in, urkunden, iv, he, transformed, egypt, into, an, international, superpower, by, creating, an, empire, that, stretched, from, the, asian, regions, of, syria, to, the, north, to, upper, nubia, to, the, south, much, is, known, about, thutmose, the, warrior, because, of, his, royal, scribe, and, army, commander, thanuny, who, wrote, about, his, conquests, and, reign, thutmose, iii, was, able, to, conquer, so, many, lands, because, of, revolutionary, developments, in, military, technology, the, hyksos, may, have, brought, advanced, weaponry, such, as, horse, drawn, chariots, around, 1650, bc, which, the, egyptians, adopted, in, the, process, of, driving, them, out, thutmose, iii, encountered, little, resistance, from, neighbouring, kingdoms, allowing, him, to, expand, his, realm, easily, his, army, also, portaged, boats, over, dry, land, when, hatshepsut, died, on, the, 10th, day, of, the, sixth, month, of, thutmose, iii, s, 21st, year, according, to, information, from, a, single, stela, from, armant, the, king, of, kadesh, advanced, his, army, to, megiddo, thutmose, iii, mustered, his, own, army, and, departed, egypt, passing, through, the, border, fortress, of, tjaru, sile, on, the, 25th, day, of, the, eighth, month, thutmose, marched, his, troops, through, the, coastal, plain, as, far, as, jamnia, then, inland, to, yehem, a, small, city, near, megiddo, which, he, reached, in, the, middle, of, the, ninth, month, of, the, same, year, the, ensuing, battle, of, megiddo, probably, was, the, largest, battle, of, thutmose, s, 17, campaigns, a, ridge, of, mountains, jutting, inland, from, mount, carmel, stood, between, thutmose, and, megiddo, and, he, had, three, potential, routes, to, take, the, northern, route, and, the, southern, route, both, of, which, went, around, the, mountain, were, judged, by, his, council, of, war, to, be, the, safest, but, thutmose, as, he, boasted, in, an, inscription, called, them, cowards, and, took, the, dangerous, route, through, the, aruna, mountain, pass, only, wide, enough, for, single, file, horse, after, horse, and, man, after, man, such, a, pass, does, indeed, exist, although, not, as, narrow, as, thutmose, claims, and, emerges, on, the, plain, of, esdraelon, brilliantly, cutting, between, the, rear, of, the, canaanite, forces, and, megiddo, city, for, some, reason, the, canaanite, forces, did, not, attack, his, army, as, it, emerged, and, thutmose, routed, them, decisively, after, the, victory, his, troops, stopped, to, plunder, the, enemy, who, was, able, to, escape, into, megiddo, thutmose, was, forced, to, besiege, the, city, and, finally, took, it, after, a, siege, of, seven, or, eight, months, the, size, of, the, two, forces, is, difficult, to, determine, but, redford, uses, the, time, to, march, the, army, through, the, pass, estimate, the, egyptian, numbers, and, the, number, of, sheep, and, goats, captured, in, the, battle, to, estimate, the, canaanite, force, concluding, both, armies, were, around, 10, 000, men, most, scholars, believe, that, the, egyptian, army, was, more, numerous, according, to, thutmose, iii, s, hall, of, annals, in, the, temple, of, amun, at, karnak, the, battle, occurred, on, year, 23, i, shemu, 21, the, exact, day, of, the, feast, of, the, new, moon, a, lunar, date, this, date, corresponds, to, 9, may, 1457, bc, based, on, thutmose, iii, s, accession, in, 1479, bc, this, campaign, drastically, changed, the, political, situation, in, the, ancient, near, east, by, taking, megiddo, thutmose, gained, control, of, all, of, northern, canaan, forcing, the, syrian, princes, to, send, tribute, and, their, own, sons, as, hostages, to, egypt, beyond, the, euphrates, the, assyrian, babylonian, and, hittite, kings, all, gave, thutmose, gifts, which, he, claimed, as, tribute, on, the, walls, of, karnak, the, only, noticeable, absence, is, mitanni, which, would, bear, the, brunt, of, the, following, egyptian, campaigns, into, western, asia, thutmose, s, second, third, and, fourth, campaigns, appear, to, have, been, nothing, more, than, tours, of, syria, and, canaan, to, collect, tribute, traditionally, the, material, directly, after, the, text, of, the, first, campaign, has, been, considered, to, be, the, second, campaign, this, text, records, tribute, from, the, area, which, the, egyptians, called, retjenu, roughly, equivalent, to, canaan, and, it, was, also, at, this, time, that, assyria, paid, a, second, tribute, to, thutmose, iii, it, is, probable, that, these, texts, come, from, thutmose, s, 40th, year, or, later, and, thus, have, nothing, to, do, with, the, second, campaign, at, all, if, so, no, records, of, this, campaign, have, been, found, thutmose, s, third, campaign, was, not, considered, significant, enough, to, appear, in, his, otherwise, extensive, annals, at, karnak, a, survey, was, made, of, the, animals, and, plants, he, found, in, canaan, which, was, illustrated, on, the, walls, of, a, special, room, at, karnak, this, survey, is, dated, to, thutmose, s, 25th, year, no, record, remains, of, thutmose, s, fourth, campaign, but, at, some, point, a, fort, was, built, in, lower, lebanon, and, timber, was, cut, for, construction, of, a, processional, barque, and, this, probably, fits, best, during, this, time, frame, the, fifth, sixth, and, seventh, campaigns, of, thutmose, iii, were, directed, against, the, phoenician, cities, in, syria, and, against, kadesh, on, the, orontes, in, thutmose, s, 29th, year, he, began, his, fifth, campaign, where, he, first, took, an, unknown, city, the, name, falls, in, a, lacuna, which, had, been, garrisoned, by, tunip, he, then, moved, inland, and, took, the, city, and, territory, around, ardata, the, town, was, pillaged, and, its, wheatfields, burned, unlike, previous, plundering, raids, thutmose, iii, garrisoned, djahy, a, name, which, probably, refers, to, southern, syria, this, would, have, permitted, him, to, ship, supplies, and, troops, between, syria, and, egypt, and, some, have, supposed, that, thutmose, s, sixth, campaign, in, his, thirtieth, year, commenced, with, naval, transport, of, troops, directly, to, byblos, bypassing, canaan, after, the, troops, arrived, in, syria, they, proceeded, into, the, jordan, river, valley, and, moved, north, pillaging, kadesh, s, lands, turning, west, again, thutmose, took, simyra, and, quelled, a, rebellion, in, ardata, which, apparently, had, rebelled, again, to, stop, such, rebellions, thutmose, began, taking, hostages, from, the, cities, in, syria, the, policy, of, these, cities, was, driven, by, their, nobles, aligned, to, mitanni, and, typically, consisting, of, a, king, and, a, small, number, of, foreign, maryannu, thutmose, iii, found, that, taking, hostages, from, these, noble, families, largely, ensured, their, loyalty, syria, rebelled, again, in, thutmose, s, 31st, year, and, he, returned, for, his, seventh, campaign, taking, the, port, city, of, ullaza, and, the, smaller, phoenician, ports, and, imposing, more, measures, to, prevent, rebellion, by, taking, away, the, grain, stores, of, syria, to, his, recently, conquered, harbors, for, support, of, his, occupying, troops, and, administrators, he, left, the, famished, cities, of, syria, without, the, means, to, fund, further, rebellions, after, thutmose, iii, had, taken, control, of, the, syrian, cities, the, obvious, target, for, his, eighth, campaign, was, the, state, of, mitanni, a, hurrian, country, with, an, indo, aryan, ruling, class, however, to, reach, mitanni, he, had, to, cross, the, euphrates, river, he, sailed, directly, to, byblos, and, made, boats, which, he, took, with, him, over, land, on, what, appeared, to, otherwise, be, just, another, tour, of, syria, and, he, proceeded, with, the, usual, raiding, and, pillaging, as, he, moved, north, through, the, lands, he, had, already, taken, he, continued, north, through, the, territory, belonging, to, the, still, unconquered, cities, of, aleppo, and, carchemish, and, quickly, crossed, the, euphrates, in, his, boats, taking, the, mitannian, king, entirely, by, surprise, it, appears, that, mitanni, was, not, expecting, an, invasion, so, they, had, no, army, of, any, kind, ready, to, defend, against, thutmose, although, their, ships, on, the, euphrates, did, try, to, defend, against, the, egyptian, crossing, thutmose, iii, then, went, freely, from, city, to, city, and, pillaged, them, while, the, nobles, hid, in, caves, or, at, least, this, is, the, typically, propagandistic, way, egyptian, records, chose, to, record, it, during, this, period, of, no, opposition, thutmose, put, up, a, second, stele, commemorating, his, crossing, of, the, euphrates, next, to, the, stele, his, grandfather, thutmose, i, had, put, up, several, decades, earlier, a, militia, was, raised, to, fight, the, invaders, but, it, fared, very, poorly, thutmose, iii, then, returned, to, syria, by, way, of, niy, where, he, records, that, he, engaged, in, an, elephant, hunt, he, collected, tribute, from, foreign, powers, and, returned, to, egypt, in, victory, thutmose, iii, returned, to, syria, for, his, ninth, campaign, in, his, 34th, year, but, this, appears, to, have, been, just, a, raid, of, the, area, called, nukhashshe, a, region, populated, by, semi, nomadic, people, the, plunder, recorded, is, minimal, so, it, was, probably, just, a, minor, raid, records, from, his, 10th, campaign, indicate, much, more, fighting, by, thutmose, s, 35th, year, the, king, of, mitanni, had, raised, a, large, army, and, engaged, the, egyptians, around, aleppo, as, usual, for, any, egyptian, king, thutmose, boasted, a, total, crushing, victory, but, this, statement, is, suspect, due, to, the, very, small, amount, of, plunder, taken, thutmose, s, annals, at, karnak, indicate, he, only, took, a, total, of, 10, prisoners, of, war, he, may, have, fought, the, mitannians, to, a, stalemate, yet, he, did, receive, tribute, from, the, hittites, after, that, campaign, which, seems, to, indicate, the, outcome, of, the, battle, was, in, thutmose, s, favor, the, details, about, his, next, two, campaigns, are, unknown, his, 11th, is, presumed, to, have, happened, in, his, 36th, regnal, year, and, his, 12th, is, presumed, to, have, happened, in, his, 37th, year, since, his, 13th, is, mentioned, at, karnak, as, happening, in, his, 38th, regnal, year, part, of, the, tribute, list, for, his, 12th, campaign, remains, immediately, before, his, 13th, begins, and, the, contents, recorded, specifically, wild, game, and, certain, minerals, of, uncertain, identification, might, indicate, that, it, took, place, on, the, steppe, around, nukhashshe, but, this, remains, mere, speculation, in, year, 38, thutmose, iii, conducted, his, 13th, military, campaign, returning, to, nuha, e, for, a, very, minor, campaign, his, 14th, campaign, waged, during, his, 39th, year, was, against, the, shasu, the, location, of, this, campaign, is, impossible, to, determine, since, the, shasu, were, nomads, who, could, have, lived, anywhere, from, lebanon, to, the, transjordan, to, edom, after, this, campaign, the, numbers, given, by, thutmose, s, scribes, to, his, campaigns, all, fall, in, lacunae, so, they, can, only, be, counted, by, date, in, his, 40th, year, tribute, was, collected, from, foreign, powers, but, it, is, unknown, if, this, was, considered, a, campaign, i, e, if, the, king, went, with, it, or, if, it, was, led, by, an, official, only, the, tribute, list, remains, from, thutmose, s, next, campaign, and, nothing, may, be, deduced, about, it, except, that, it, was, probably, another, raid, to, the, frontiers, around, niy, his, final, asian, campaign, is, better, documented, sometime, before, thutmose, s, 42nd, year, mitanni, apparently, began, spreading, revolt, among, all, the, major, cities, in, syria, thutmose, moved, his, troops, by, land, up, the, coastal, road, and, put, down, rebellions, in, the, arka, plain, arkantu, in, thutmose, s, chronicle, and, moved, on, tunip, after, taking, tunip, his, attention, turned, to, kadesh, again, he, engaged, and, destroyed, three, surrounding, mitannian, garrisons, and, returned, to, egypt, in, victory, his, victory, in, this, final, campaign, was, neither, complete, nor, permanent, since, he, did, not, take, kadesh, and, tunip, could, not, have, remained, aligned, to, him, for, very, long, certainly, not, beyond, his, own, death, this, victory, however, must, have, had, quite, an, impact, for, the, next, tribute, lists, include, adana, a, cilician, city, in, year, 50, thutmose, iii, waged, his, last, military, campaign, he, attacked, nubia, but, only, went, so, far, as, the, fourth, cataract, of, the, nile, although, no, king, of, egypt, had, ever, penetrated, so, far, with, an, army, previous, kings, campaigns, had, spread, egyptian, culture, that, far, already, and, the, earliest, egyptian, document, found, at, gebel, barkal, dates, from, three, years, before, thutmose, s, campaign, thutmose, iii, was, a, great, builder, and, constructed, over, 50, temples, although, some, of, these, are, now, lost, and, only, mentioned, in, written, records, he, also, commissioned, the, building, of, many, tombs, for, nobles, which, were, made, with, greater, craftsmanship, than, ever, before, his, reign, was, also, a, period, of, great, stylistic, changes, in, the, sculpture, paintings, and, reliefs, associated, with, construction, much, of, it, beginning, during, the, reign, of, hatshepsut, thutmose, s, architects, and, artisans, showed, great, continuity, with, the, formal, style, of, previous, kings, but, several, developments, set, him, apart, from, his, predecessors, although, he, followed, the, traditional, relief, styles, for, most, of, his, reign, after, his, 42nd, year, he, began, having, himself, depicted, wearing, the, red, crown, of, lower, egypt, and, a, ndyt, kilt, an, unprecedented, style, architecturally, his, use, of, pillars, also, was, unprecedented, he, built, egypt, s, only, known, set, of, heraldic, pillars, two, large, columns, standing, alone, instead, of, being, part, of, a, set, supporting, the, roof, his, jubilee, hall, was, also, revolutionary, and, is, arguably, the, earliest, known, building, created, in, the, basilica, style, thutmose, s, artisans, achieved, new, heights, of, skill, in, painting, and, tombs, from, his, reign, were, the, earliest, to, be, entirely, painted, instead, of, painted, reliefs, although, not, directly, pertaining, to, his, monuments, it, appears, that, thutmose, s, artisans, had, learned, glass, making, skills, developed, in, the, early, 18th, dynasty, to, create, drinking, vessels, by, the, core, formed, method, thutmose, dedicated, far, more, attention, to, karnak, than, any, other, site, in, the, iput, isut, the, temple, proper, in, the, center, he, rebuilt, the, hypostyle, hall, of, his, grandfather, thutmose, i, dismantled, the, red, chapel, of, hatshepsut, built, pylon, vi, a, shrine, for, the, bark, of, amun, in, its, place, and, built, an, antechamber, in, front, of, it, the, ceiling, of, which, was, supported, by, his, heraldic, pillars, he, built, a, temenos, wall, around, the, central, chapel, containing, smaller, chapels, along, with, workshops, and, storerooms, east, of, the, main, sanctuary, he, built, a, jubilee, hall, in, which, to, celebrate, his, sed, festival, the, main, hall, was, built, in, basilica, style, with, rows, of, pillars, supporting, the, ceiling, on, each, side, of, the, aisle, the, central, two, rows, were, higher, than, the, others, to, create, windows, where, the, ceiling, was, split, two, of, the, smaller, rooms, in, this, temple, contained, the, reliefs, of, the, survey, of, the, plants, and, animals, of, canaan, which, he, took, in, his, third, campaign, east, of, the, iput, isut, he, erected, another, temple, to, aten, where, he, was, depicted, as, being, supported, by, amun, it, was, inside, this, temple, that, thutmose, planned, on, erecting, his, tekhen, waty, or, unique, obelisk, the, tekhen, waty, was, designed, to, stand, alone, instead, as, part, of, a, pair, and, is, the, tallest, obelisk, ever, successfully, cut, it, was, not, however, erected, until, thutmose, iv, raised, it, 35, years, later, it, was, later, moved, to, rome, by, emperor, constantius, ii, and, is, now, known, as, the, lateran, obelisk, in, 390, ad, christian, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, re, erected, another, obelisk, from, the, temple, of, karnak, in, the, hippodrome, of, constantinople, now, known, as, the, obelisk, of, theodosius, thutmose, also, undertook, building, projects, to, the, south, of, the, main, temple, between, the, sanctuary, of, amun, and, the, temple, of, mut, immediately, to, the, south, of, the, main, temple, he, built, the, seventh, pylon, on, the, north, south, road, which, entered, the, temple, between, the, fourth, and, fifth, pylons, it, was, built, for, use, during, his, jubilee, and, was, covered, with, scenes, of, defeated, enemies, he, set, royal, colossi, on, both, sides, of, the, pylon, and, put, two, more, obelisks, on, the, south, face, in, front, of, the, gateway, the, eastern, obelisk, s, base, remains, in, place, but, the, western, obelisk, was, transported, to, the, hippodrome, in, constantinople, farther, south, along, the, road, he, put, up, pylon, viii, which, hatshepsut, had, begun, east, of, the, road, he, dug, a, sacred, lake, of, 250, by, 400, feet, and, placed, another, alabaster, bark, shrine, near, it, he, commissioned, royal, artists, to, depict, his, extensive, collections, of, fauna, and, flora, in, the, botanical, garden, of, thutmosis, iii, at, heliopolis, a, stela, dated, to, year, 47, of, tuthmosis, iii, for, many, years, egyptologists, theorized, that, following, the, death, of, thutmose, ii, his, queen, hatshepsut, usurped, the, throne, from, her, stepson, thutmose, iii, although, thutmose, iii, was, co, regent, during, this, time, early, historians, have, speculated, that, he, never, forgave, his, stepmother, for, overshadowing, him, some, time, after, her, death, many, of, hatshepsut, s, monuments, and, depictions, were, defaced, or, destroyed, including, those, in, her, famous, mortuary, temple, complex, at, deir, el, bahri, these, were, interpreted, by, early, modern, scholars, as, damnatio, memoriae, erasure, from, recorded, existence, by, thutmose, iii, in, a, fit, of, vengeful, rage, shortly, after, his, accession, however, recent, research, casts, serious, doubt, upon, the, popular, theory, of, thutmose, iii, s, vengeance, scholars, such, as, charles, nims, and, peter, dorman, have, re, examined, the, erasures, and, found, that, those, which, could, be, dated, only, began, during, year, 46, or, 47, toward, the, end, of, thutmose, s, reign, c, 1433, 2, bc, also, the, monuments, of, hatshepsut, s, chief, steward, senenmut, closely, associated, with, her, rule, were, similarly, defaced, where, they, were, found, furthermore, it, is, known, that, hatshepsut, trusted, thutmose, iii, to, command, her, armies, no, strong, evidence, has, been, found, that, thutmose, iii, sought, to, claim, the, throne, and, after, her, death, he, kept, her, religious, and, administrative, leaders, he, even, built, his, mortuary, temple, directly, next, to, hatshepsut, s, showing, no, grudge, against, her, by, the, time, the, monuments, of, hatshepsut, were, damaged, at, least, 25, years, after, her, death, the, elderly, thutmose, iii, was, in, a, coregency, with, his, son, amenhotep, ii, currently, the, purposeful, destruction, of, the, memory, of, hatshepsut, is, seen, as, an, attempt, to, ensure, a, smooth, succession, for, amenhotep, ii, as, opposed, to, any, of, the, surviving, relatives, of, hatshepsut, with, an, equal, or, better, claim, to, the, throne, later, amenhotep, ii, even, claimed, that, he, had, built, the, structures, he, defaced, it, may, also, be, that, the, attack, on, hatshepsut, s, memory, could, not, be, taken, until, the, death, of, powerful, religious, and, administrative, officials, who, had, served, under, both, hatshepsut, and, thutmose, iii, thutmose, s, tomb, kv34, was, discovered, by, victor, loret, in, 1898, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, its, plan, is, typical, of, 18th, dynasty, tombs, with, a, sharp, turn, at, the, vestibule, preceding, the, burial, chamber, two, stairways, and, two, corridors, provide, access, to, the, vestibule, which, is, preceded, by, a, quadrangular, shaft, or, well, a, complete, version, of, amduat, an, important, new, kingdom, funerary, text, is, in, the, vestibule, making, it, the, first, tomb, where, the, complete, text, was, found, the, burial, chamber, supported, by, two, pillars, is, oval, shaped, and, its, ceiling, decorated, with, stars, symbolizing, the, cave, of, the, deity, sokar, in, the, middle, lies, a, large, red, quartzite, sarcophagus, in, the, shape, of, a, cartouche, on, the, two, pillars, in, the, middle, of, the, chamber, are, passages, from, the, litanies, of, re, celebrating, the, later, sun, deity, who, was, identified, with, the, pharaoh, at, this, time, on, the, other, pillar, is, a, unique, image, depicting, thutmosis, iii, being, suckled, by, the, goddess, isis, in, the, guise, of, the, tree, the, wall, decorations, are, executed, in, a, simple, diagrammatic, way, imitating, the, manner, of, the, cursive, script, of, a, funerary, papyrus, rather, than, the, more, lavish, wall, decorations, typical, of, most, other, royal, tombs, the, colouring, is, similarly, muted, executed, in, simple, black, figures, accompanied, by, text, on, a, cream, background, with, highlights, in, red, and, pink, the, decorations, depict, the, pharaoh, aiding, the, deities, in, defeating, apep, the, serpent, of, chaos, thereby, helping, to, ensure, the, daily, rebirth, of, the, sun, as, well, as, the, pharaoh, s, own, resurrection, according, to, peter, der, manuelian, a, statement, in, the, tomb, biography, of, the, official, amenemheb, establishes, that, thutmose, iii, died, in, year, 54, iii, peret, day, 30, of, his, reign, after, ruling, egypt, for, 53, years, 10, months, and, 26, days, urk, 180, 15, thutmose, iii, died, one, month, and, four, days, before, the, start, of, his, 54th, regnal, year, when, the, co, regencies, with, hatshepsut, and, amenhotep, ii, are, deducted, he, ruled, as, sole, pharaoh, for, just, over, 30, years, thutmose, iii, s, mummy, was, discovered, in, the, deir, el, bahri, cache, above, the, mortuary, temple, of, hatshepsut, in, 1881, he, was, interred, along, with, those, of, other, 18th, and, 19th, dynasty, leaders, ahmose, i, amenhotep, i, thutmose, i, thutmose, ii, ramesses, i, seti, i, ramesses, ii, and, ramesses, ix, as, well, as, the, 21st, dynasty, pharaohs, pinedjem, i, pinedjem, ii, and, siamun, while, it, is, popularly, thought, that, his, mummy, originally, was, unwrapped, by, gaston, maspero, in, 1886, it, was, in, fact, first, unwrapped, by, mile, brugsch, the, egyptologist, who, supervised, the, evacuation, of, the, mummies, from, the, deir, el, bahri, cache, in, 1881, it, was, unwrapped, soon, after, its, arrival, in, the, boulak, museum, while, maspero, was, away, in, france, and, the, director, general, of, the, egyptian, antiquities, service, ordered, the, mummy, re, wrapped, so, when, it, was, officially, unwrapped, by, maspero, in, 1886, he, almost, certainly, knew, it, was, in, relatively, poor, condition, the, mummy, had, been, damaged, extensively, in, antiquity, by, tomb, robbers, and, its, wrappings, subsequently, cut, into, and, torn, by, the, rassul, family, who, had, rediscovered, the, tomb, and, its, contents, only, a, few, years, before, maspero, s, description, of, the, body, provides, an, idea, as, to, the, severity, of, the, damage, his, mummy, was, not, securely, hidden, away, for, towards, the, close, of, the, 20th, dynasty, it, was, torn, out, of, the, coffin, by, robbers, who, stripped, it, and, rifled, it, of, the, jewels, with, which, it, was, covered, injuring, it, in, their, haste, to, carry, away, the, spoil, it, was, subsequently, re, interred, and, has, remained, undisturbed, until, the, present, day, but, before, re, burial, some, renovation, of, the, wrappings, was, necessary, and, as, portions, of, the, body, had, become, loose, the, restorers, in, order, to, give, the, mummy, the, necessary, firmness, compressed, it, between, four, oar, shaped, slips, of, wood, painted, white, and, placed, three, inside, the, wrappings, and, one, outside, under, the, bands, which, confined, the, winding, sheet, of, the, face, which, was, undamaged, maspero, says, the, following, happily, the, face, which, had, been, plastered, over, with, pitch, at, the, time, of, embalming, did, not, suffer, at, all, from, this, rough, treatment, and, appeared, intact, when, the, protecting, mask, was, removed, its, appearance, does, not, answer, to, our, ideal, of, the, conqueror, his, statues, though, not, representing, him, as, a, type, of, manly, beauty, yet, give, him, refined, intelligent, features, but, a, comparison, with, the, mummy, shows, that, the, artists, have, idealised, their, model, the, forehead, is, abnormally, low, the, eyes, deeply, sunk, the, jaw, heavy, the, lips, thick, and, the, cheek, bones, extremely, prominent, the, whole, recalling, the, physiognomy, of, th, tmosis, ii, though, with, a, greater, show, of, energy, maspero, was, so, disheartened, at, the, state, of, the, mummy, and, the, prospect, that, all, of, the, other, mummies, were, similarly, damaged, as, it, turned, out, few, were, in, so, poor, a, state, that, he, would, not, unwrap, another, for, several, years, unlike, many, other, examples, from, the, deir, el, bahri, cache, the, wooden, mummiform, coffin, that, contained, the, body, was, original, to, the, pharaoh, though, any, gilding, or, decoration, it, might, have, had, had, been, hacked, off, in, antiquity, in, his, examination, of, the, mummy, the, anatomist, grafton, elliot, smith, stated, the, height, of, thutmose, iii, s, mummy, to, be, 1, 615, m, 5, ft, 3, 58, in, but, the, mummy, was, missing, its, feet, so, thutmose, iii, was, undoubtedly, taller, than, the, figure, given, by, smith, it, resided, in, the, royal, mummies, hall, of, the, museum, of, egyptian, antiquities, catalog, number, cg, 61068, until, april, 2021, when, the, mummy, was, moved, to, national, museum, of, egyptian, civilization, along, with, those, of, 17, other, kings, and, four, queens, in, the, pharaohs, golden, parade, shamshi, adad, dynasty, 1808,
