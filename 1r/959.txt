there, he, became, increasingly, disillusioned, with, the, liberal, christianity, in, which, he, had, been, trained, this, led, him, to, write, the, first, edition, of, his, the, epistle, to, the,

influence, on, modern, christian, ethics, influencing, the, work, of, ethicists, such, as, stanley, hauerwas, john, howard, yoder, jacques, ellul, and, oliver, o, donovan, karl, barth, was, born, on, 10, may, 1886, in, basel, switzerland, to, johann, friedrich, fritz, barth, 1852, 1912, and, anna, katharina, sartorius, barth, 1863, 1938, karl, had, two, younger, brothers, peter, barth, 1888, 1940, and, heinrich, barth, 1890, 1965, and, two, sisters, katharina, and, gertrude, fritz, barth, was, a, theology, professor, and, pastor, and, desired, for, karl, to, follow, his, positive, line, of, christianity, which, clashed, with, karl, s, desire, to, receive, a, liberal, protestant, education, karl, began, his, student, career, at, the, university, of, bern, and, then, transferred, to, the, university, of, berlin, to, study, under, adolf, von, harnack, and, then, transferred, briefly, to, the, university, of, t, bingen, before, finally, in, marburg, to, study, under, wilhelm, herrmann, 1846, 1922, from, 1911, to, 1921, barth, served, as, a, reformed, pastor, in, the, village, of, safenwil, in, the, canton, of, aargau, in, 1913, he, married, nelly, hoffmann, a, talented, violinist,

1986, later, karl, barth, was, professor, of, theology, in, g, ttingen, 1921, 1925, m, nster, 1925, 1930, and, bonn, 1930, 1935, in, germany, while, serving, at, g, ttingen, he, met, charlotte, von, kirschbaum, who, became, his, long, time, secretary, assistant, and, lover, she, lived, in, the, family, home, for, 37, years, and, played, a, large, role, in, the, writing, of, his, epic, the, church, dogmatics, he, was, deported, from, germany, in, 1935, after, he, refused, to, sign, without, modification, the, oath, of, loyalty, to, adolf, hitler, and, went, back, to, switzerland, and, became, a, professor, in, basel, 1935, 1962, liberal, theology, german, moderne, theologie, was, a, trend, in, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, protestant, theology, to, reinterpret, traditional, beliefs, in, two, ways, first, it, adopted, an, historical, critical, approach, to, the, sources, of, christianity, second, it, engaged, with, the, questions, that, science, philosophy, and, other, disciplines, raised, for, the, christian, faith, barth, s, striking, out, on, a, different, theological, course, from, that, of, his, liberal, university, teachers, adolf, von, harnack, and, wilhelm, herrmann, was, due, to, several, significant, influences, and, events, while, pastor, at, safenwil, barth, had, an, influential, friendship, with, neighbouring, pastor, eduard, thurneysen, troubled, that, their, theological, educations, had, left, them, ill, equipped, to, preach, god, s, message, effectively, they, together, engaged, in, an, intensive, quest, to, find, a, wholly, other, theological, foundation, than, that, which, schleiermacher, had, proposed, in, august, 1914, barth, was, dismayed, to, learn, that, his, venerated, teachers, including, adolf, von, harnack, had, signed, the, manifesto, of, the, ninety, three, german, intellectuals, to, the, civilized, world, as, a, result, barth, concluded, he, could, not, follow, their, understanding, of, the, bible, and, history, any, longer, in, 1915, barth, and, thurneysen, visited, christoph, blumhardt, leader, of, the, bad, boll, christian, community, and, social, democratic, politician, their, conversation, made, a, deep, impression, on, barth, he, later, commented, that, blumhardt, always, begins, with, god, s, presence, power, and, purpose, which, indicates, a, likely, influence, in, shaping, his, own, theocentric, starting, point, barth, also, found, in, blumhardt, s, pro, socialist, politics, an, inspiring, encouragement, for, his, own, advocacy, for, the, rights, and, unionization, of, safenwil, textile, workers, and, alignment, with, social, democratic, values, these, activities, and, a, public, disagreement, with, a, local, factory, owner, earned, him, local, notoriety, as, the, red, pastor, barth, s, theological, response, was, to, adopt, a, dialectical, approach, in, which, he, deliberately, sought, to, interrupt, and, destabilize, the, assumptions, of, liberal, theology, by, a, method, of, negation, and, affirmation, in, a, lecture, delivered, in, arau, in, 1916, barth, argued, that, god, s, righteousness, is, revealed, like, a, trumpet, blast, from, another, world, that, interrupts, one, s, obligation, to, nation, and, also, interrupts, the, nurturing, of, religious, thoughts, and, feelings, a, no, to, these, assumptions, knocks, one, to, the, floor, but, a, yes, to, god, s, righteousness, and, glory, sets, one, on, one, s, feet, again, although, in, one, sense, it, is, accurate, to, say, that, barth, s, dialectical, approach, sought, deliberately, to, destabilize, the, assumptions, of, liberal, theology, in, another, sense, it, is, important, to, acknowledge, that, barth, never, totally, repudiated, the, historical, critical, approach, to, the, scriptures, in, addition, he, continued, to, engage, with, the, questions, that, other, disciplines, raised, for, the, christian, faith, typically, responding, with, a, robust, theological, and, christ, centered, approach, barth, first, began, his, commentary, the, epistle, to, the, romans, german, der, r, merbrief, in, the, summer, of, 1916, while, he, was, still, a, pastor, in, safenwil, with, the, first, edition, appearing, in, december, 1918, but, with, a, publication, date, of, 1919, on, the, strength, of, the, first, edition, of, the, commentary, barth, was, invited, to, teach, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, barth, decided, around, october, 1920, that, he, was, dissatisfied, with, the, first, edition, and, heavily, revised, it, the, following, eleven, months, finishing, the, second, edition, around, september, 1921, particularly, in, the, thoroughly, re, written, second, edition, of, 1922, barth, argued, that, the, god, who, is, revealed, in, the, life, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, challenges, and, overthrows, any, attempt, to, ally, god, with, human, cultures, achievements, or, possessions, the, book, s, popularity, led, to, its, republication, and, reprinting, in, several, languages, in, 1934, as, the, protestant, church, attempted, to, come, to, terms, with, nazi, germany, barth, was, largely, responsible, for, the, writing, of, the, barmen, declaration, barmer, erkl, rung, this, declaration, rejected, the, influence, of, nazism, on, german, christianity, by, arguing, that, the, church, s, allegiance, to, the, god, of, jesus, christ, should, give, it, the, impetus, and, resources, to, resist, the, influence, of, other, lords, such, as, the, german, f, hrer, adolf, hitler, barth, mailed, this, declaration, to, hitler, personally, this, was, one, of, the, founding, documents, of, the, confessing, church, and, barth, was, elected, a, member, of, its, leadership, council, the, bruderrat, he, was, forced, to, resign, from, his, professorship, at, the, university, of, bonn, in, 1935, for, refusing, to, swear, an, oath, to, hitler, barth, then, returned, to, his, native, switzerland, where, he, assumed, a, chair, in, systematic, theology, at, the, university, of, basel, in, the, course, of, his, appointment, he, was, required, to, answer, a, routine, question, asked, of, all, swiss, civil, servants, whether, he, supported, the, national, defence, his, answer, was, yes, especially, on, the, northern, border, the, newspaper, neue, z, rcher, zeitung, carried, his, 1936, criticism, of, the, philosopher, martin, heidegger, for, his, support, of, the, nazis, in, 1938, he, wrote, a, letter, to, a, czech, colleague, josef, hrom, dka, in, which, he, declared, that, soldiers, who, fought, against, nazi, germany, were, serving, a, christian, cause, barth, s, theology, found, its, most, sustained, and, compelling, expression, in, his, five, volume, magnum, opus, the, church, dogmatics, kirchliche, dogmatik, widely, regarded, as, an, important, theological, work, the, church, dogmatics, represents, the, pinnacle, of, barth, s, achievement, as, a, theologian, church, dogmatics, runs, to, over, six, million, words, and, 9, 000, pages, one, of, the, longest, works, of, systematic, theology, ever, written, the, church, dogmatics, is, in, five, volumes, the, doctrine, of, the, word, of, god, the, doctrine, of, god, the, doctrine, of, creation, the, doctrine, of, reconciliation, and, the, doctrine, of, redemption, barth, s, planned, fifth, volume, was, never, written, and, the, fourth, volume, s, final, part, volume, was, unfinished, after, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, barth, became, an, important, voice, in, support, both, of, german, penitence, and, of, reconciliation, with, churches, abroad, together, with, hans, iwand, he, authored, the, darmstadt, declaration, in, 1947, a, more, concrete, statement, of, german, guilt, and, responsibility, for, nazi, germany, and, the, second, world, war, than, the, 1945, stuttgart, declaration, of, guilt, in, it, he, made, the, point, that, the, church, s, willingness, to, side, with, anti, socialist, and, conservative, forces, had, led, to, its, susceptibility, to, nazi, ideology, in, the, context, of, the, developing, cold, war, that, controversial, statement, was, rejected, by, anti, communists, in, the, west, who, supported, the, christian, democratic, union, of, germany, course, of, re, militarization, as, well, as, by, east, german, dissidents, who, believed, that, it, did, not, sufficiently, depict, the, dangers, of, communism, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1950, in, the, 1950s, barth, sympathized, with, the, peace, movement, and, opposed, west, german, rearmament, barth, was, exempted, from, a, regulation, that, limited, the, tenure, of, a, professorship, at, the, university, of, basel, to, the, year, they, were, 70, years, of, age, which, he, would, have, reached, in, 1956, barth, wrote, a, 1960, article, for, the, christian, century, regarding, the, east, west, question, in, which, he, denied, any, inclination, toward, eastern, communism, and, stated, he, did, not, wish, to, live, under, communism, or, wish, anyone, to, be, forced, to, do, so, he, acknowledged, a, fundamental, disagreement, with, most, of, those, around, him, writing, i, do, not, comprehend, how, either, politics, or, christianity, require, or, even, permit, such, a, disinclination, to, lead, to, the, conclusions, which, the, west, has, drawn, with, increasing, sharpness, in, the, past, 15, years, i, regard, anticommunism, as, a, matter, of, principle, an, evil, even, greater, than, communism, itself, in, 1962, barth, visited, the, united, states, and, lectured, at, princeton, theological, seminary, the, university, of, chicago, the, union, theological, seminary, and, the, san, francisco, theological, seminary, he, was, invited, to, be, a, guest, at, the, second, vatican, council, at, the, time, barth, s, health, did, not, permit, him, to, attend, however, he, was, able, to, visit, the, vatican, and, be, a, guest, of, the, pope, in, 1967, after, which, he, wrote, the, small, volume, ad, limina, apostolorum, at, the, threshold, of, the, apostles, barth, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, the, 20, april, 1962, issue, of, time, magazine, an, indication, that, his, influence, had, reached, out, of, academic, and, ecclesiastical, circles, and, into, mainstream, american, religious, culture, pope, pius, xii, is, sometimes, claimed, to, have, called, barth, the, greatest, theologian, since, thomas, aquinas, though, fergus, kerr, observes, that, there, is, never, chapter, and, verse, for, the, quotation, and, it, is, sometimes, attributed, to, pope, paul, vi, instead, barth, died, on, 10, december, 1968, at, his, home, in, basel, switzerland, the, evening, before, his, death, he, had, encouraged, his, lifelong, friend, eduard, thurneysen, that, he, should, not, be, downhearted, for, things, are, ruled, not, just, in, moscow, or, in, washington, or, in, peking, but, things, are, ruled, even, here, on, earth, entirely, from, above, from, heaven, above, karl, barth, s, most, significant, theological, work, is, his, summa, theology, titled, the, church, dogmatics, which, contains, barth, s, doctrine, of, the, word, of, god, doctrine, of, god, doctrine, of, reconciliation, and, doctrine, of, redemption, barth, is, most, well, known, for, reorienting, all, theological, discussion, around, jesus, one, major, objective, of, barth, is, to, recover, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, in, theology, from, its, putative, loss, in, liberalism, his, argument, follows, from, the, idea, that, god, is, the, object, of, god, s, own, self, knowledge, and, revelation, in, the, bible, means, the, self, unveiling, to, humanity, of, the, god, who, cannot, be, discovered, by, humanity, simply, through, its, own, intuition, god, s, revelation, comes, to, man, vertically, from, above, senkrecht, von, oben, one, of, the, most, influential, and, controversial, features, of, barth, s, dogmatics, was, his, doctrine, of, election, church, dogmatics, ii, 2, barth, s, theology, entails, a, rejection, of, the, idea, that, god, chose, each, person, to, either, be, saved, or, damned, based, on, purposes, of, the, divine, will, and, it, was, impossible, to, know, why, god, chose, some, and, not, others, barth, s, doctrine, of, election, involves, a, firm, rejection, of, the, notion, of, an, eternal, hidden, decree, in, keeping, with, his, christo, centric, methodology, barth, argues, that, to, ascribe, the, salvation, or, damnation, of, humanity, to, an, abstract, absolute, decree, is, to, make, some, part, of, god, more, final, and, definitive, than, god, s, saving, act, in, jesus, christ, god, s, absolute, decree, if, one, may, speak, of, such, a, thing, is, god, s, gracious, decision, to, be, for, humanity, in, the, person, of, jesus, christ, drawing, from, the, earlier, reformed, tradition, barth, retains, the, notion, of, double, predestination, but, makes, jesus, himself, the, object, of, both, divine, election, and, reprobation, simultaneously, jesus, embodies, both, god, s, election, of, humanity, and, god, s, rejection, of, human, sin, while, some, regard, this, revision, of, the, doctrine, of, election, as, an, improvement, on, the, augustinian, calvinist, doctrine, of, the, predestination, of, individuals, critics, namely, emil, brunner, have, charged, that, barth, s, view, amounts, to, a, soft, universalism, thereby, departing, from, augustinian, calvinism, barth, s, doctrine, of, objective, atonement, develops, as, he, distances, himself, from, anselm, of, canterbury, s, doctrine, of, the, atonement, in, the, epistle, to, the, romans, barth, endorses, anselm, s, idea, that, god, who, is, robbed, of, his, honor, must, punish, those, who, robbed, him, in, church, dogmatics, i, 2, barth, advocates, divine, freedom, in, the, incarnation, with, the, support, of, anselm, s, cur, deus, homo, barth, holds, that, anselm, s, doctrine, of, the, atonement, preserves, both, god, s, freedom, and, the, necessity, of, christ, s, incarnation, the, positive, endorsement, of, anselmian, motives, in, cur, deus, homo, continues, in, church, dogmatics, ii, 1, barth, maintains, with, anselm, that, the, sin, of, humanity, cannot, be, removed, by, the, merciful, act, of, divine, forgiveness, alone, in, church, dogmatics, iv, 1, however, barth, s, doctrine, of, the, atonement, diverges, from, that, of, anselm, by, over, christologizing, the, doctrine, barth, completes, his, formulation, of, objective, atonement, he, finalizes, the, necessity, of, god, s, mercy, at, the, place, where, anselm, firmly, establishes, the, dignity, and, freedom, of, the, will, of, god, in, barth, s, view, god, s, mercy, is, identified, with, god, s, righteousness, in, a, distinctive, way, where, god, s, mercy, always, takes, the, initiative, the, change, in, barth, s, reception, of, anselm, s, doctrine, of, the, atonement, is, therefore, alleged, to, show, that, barth, s, doctrine, entails, support, for, universalism, barth, argued, that, previous, perspectives, on, sin, and, salvation, influenced, by, strict, calvinist, thinking, sometimes, misled, christians, into, thinking, that, predestination, set, up, humanity, such, that, the, vast, majority, of, human, beings, were, foreseen, to, disobey, and, reject, god, with, damnation, coming, to, them, as, a, matter, of, fate, barth, s, view, of, salvation, is, centrally, christological, with, his, writings, stating, that, in, jesus, christ, the, reconciliation, of, all, of, mankind, to, god, has, essentially, already, taken, place, and, that, through, christ, man, is, already, elect, and, justified, karl, barth, denied, that, he, was, a, universalist, i, do, not, believe, in, universalism, but, i, do, believe, in, jesus, christ, reconciler, of, all, however, barth, asserted, that, eternal, salvation, for, everyone, even, those, that, reject, god, is, a, possibility, that, is, not, just, an, open, question, but, should, be, hoped, for, by, christians, as, a, matter, of, grace, specifically, he, wrote, even, though, theological, consistency, might, seem, to, lead, our, thoughts, and, utterances, most, clearly, in, this, direction, we, must, not, arrogate, to, ourselves, that, which, can, be, given, and, received, only, as, a, free, gift, just, hoping, for, total, reconciliation, barth, in, the, words, of, a, later, scholar, went, a, significant, step, beyond, traditional, theology, in, that, he, argued, against, more, conservative, strains, of, protestant, christianity, in, which, damnation, is, seen, as, an, absolute, certainty, for, many, or, most, people, to, barth, christ, s, grace, is, central, unlike, many, protestant, theologians, barth, wrote, on, the, topic, of, mariology, the, theological, study, of, mary, barth, s, views, on, the, subject, agreed, with, much, catholic, dogma, but, he, disagreed, with, the, catholic, veneration, of, mary, aware, of, the, common, dogmatic, tradition, of, the, early, church, barth, fully, accepted, the, dogma, of, mary, as, the, mother, of, god, seeing, a, rejection, of, that, title, equivalent, to, rejecting, the, doctrine, that, christ, s, human, and, divine, natures, are, inseparable, contra, the, nestorian, heresy, through, mary, jesus, belongs, to, the, human, race, through, jesus, mary, is, mother, of, god, barth, s, doctrine, of, scripture, was, criticised, by, reformed, theologians, such, as, cornelius, van, til, dr, martyn, lloyd, jones, and, others, in, the, confessional, reformed, tradition, chapter, viii, of, van, til, s, christianity, and, barthianism, 1962, critiques, barth, s, view, of, revelation, and, das, wort, gottes, the, word, of, god, charlotte, von, kirschbaum, was, barth, s, theological, academic, colleague, for, more, than, three, decades, george, hunsinger, summarizes, the, influence, of, von, kirschbaum, on, barth, s, work, as, his, unique, student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and, confidante, charlotte, von, kirschbaum, was, indispensable, to, him, he, could, not, have, been, what, he, was, or, have, done, what, he, did, without, her, in, 2017, christiane, tietz, examined, intimate, letters, written, by, barth, charlotte, von, kirschbaum, and, nelly, barth, which, discuss, the, complicated, relationship, between, all, three, individuals, that, occurred, over, the, span, of, 40, years, released, by, barth, s, children, the, letters, between, von, kirschbaum, and, barth, from, 1925, to, 1935, made, public, the, deep, intense, and, overwhelming, love, between, these, two, human, beings, through, the, lengthy, period, in, which, von, kirschbaum, lived, in, the, same, house, as, barth, and, his, wife, nelly, in, them, barth, describes, a, permanent, conflict, between, his, marriage, and, his, affections, for, von, kirschbaum, the, way, i, am, i, never, could, and, still, cannot, deny, either, the, reality, of, my, marriage, or, the, reality, of, my, love, it, is, true, that, i, am, married, that, i, am, a, father, and, a, grandfather, it, is, also, true, that, i, love, and, it, is, true, that, these, two, facts, don, t, match, this, is, why, we, after, some, hesitation, at, the, beginning, decided, not, to, solve, the, problem, with, a, separation, on, one, or, the, other, side, when, charlotte, von, kirschbaum, died, in, 1975, barth, s, wife, nelly, buried, charlotte, in, the, family, tomb, nelly, died, the, following, year, the, publication, of, the, letters, in, english, caused, a, considerable, crisis, in, english, speaking, followers, of, barth, who, largely, were, not, aware, of, the, love, triangle, and, the, extent, to, which, barth, and, von, kirschbaum, may, not, have, been, able, to, fully, live, according, to, their, theological, statements, on, marriage, von, kirschbum, s, early, financial, dependence, on, barth, has, been, posed, as, a, moral, problem, princeton, theological, seminary, where, barth, lectured, in, 1962, houses, the, center, for, barth, studies, which, is, dedicated, to, supporting, scholarship, related, to, the, life, and, theology, of, karl, barth, the, barth, center, was, established, in, 1997, and, sponsors, seminars, conferences, and, other, events, it, also, holds, the, karl, barth, research, collection, the, largest, in, the, world, which, contains, nearly, all, of, barth, s, works, in, english, and, german, several, first, editions, of, his, works, and, an, original, handwritten, manuscript, by, barth
