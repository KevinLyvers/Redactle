irenaeus, r, n, e, s, greek, translit, eir, na, os, c, 130, c, 202, ad, was, a, greek, bishop, noted, for, his, role, in, guiding, and, expanding, christian, communities, in, the, southern, regions, of, present, day, france, and, more, widely, for, the, development, of, christian, theology, by, combating, heterodox, or, gnostic, interpretations, of, scripture, as, heresy, and, defining, proto, orthodoxy, originating, from, smyrna, he, had, seen, and, heard, the, preaching, of, polycarp, who, in, turn, was, said, to, have, heard, john, the, evangelist, and, thus, was, the, last, known, living, connection, with, the, apostles, chosen, as, bishop, of, lugdunum, now, lyon, his, best, known, work, is, against, heresies, often, cited, as, adversus, haereses, a, refutation, of, gnosticism, in, particular, that, of, valentinus, to, counter, the, doctrines, of, the, gnostic, sects, claiming, secret, wisdom, he, offered, three, pillars, of, orthodoxy, the, scriptures, the, tradition, handed, down, from, the, apostles, and, the, teaching, of, the, apostles, successors, he, is, the, earliest, surviving, witness, to, regard, all, four, of, the, now, canonical, gospels, as, essential, irenaeus, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, catholic, church, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, including, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, latin, catholic, church, celebrates, his, memorial, on, 28, june, pope, francis, declared, irenaeus, the, 37th, doctor, of, the, church, on, 21, january, 2022, the, eastern, orthodox, church, celebrates, irenaeus, the, feast, being, also, on, 23, august, irenaeus, is, honored, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, on, 28, june, irenaeus, was, a, greek, from, polycarp, s, hometown, of, smyrna, in, asia, minor, now, zmir, turkey, born, during, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, century, the, exact, date, is, thought, to, be, between, the, years, 120, and, 140, unlike, many, of, his, contemporaries, he, was, brought, up, in, a, christian, family, rather, than, converting, as, an, adult, during, the, persecution, of, christians, by, marcus, aurelius, the, roman, emperor, from, 161, to, 180, irenaeus, was, a, priest, of, the, church, of, lyon, the, clergy, of, that, city, many, of, whom, were, suffering, imprisonment, for, the, faith, sent, him, in, 177, to, rome, with, a, letter, to, pope, eleutherius, concerning, the, heresy, of, montanism, and, that, occasion, bore, emphatic, testimony, to, his, merits, while, irenaeus, was, in, rome, a, persecution, took, place, in, lyon, returning, to, gaul, irenaeus, succeeded, the, martyr, saint, pothinus, and, became, the, second, bishop, of, lyon, during, the, religious, peace, which, followed, the, persecution, by, marcus, aurelius, the, new, bishop, divided, his, activities, between, the, duties, of, a, pastor, and, of, a, missionary, as, to, which, we, have, but, brief, data, late, and, not, very, certain, almost, all, his, writings, were, directed, against, gnosticism, the, most, famous, of, these, writings, is, adversus, haereses, against, heresies, irenaeus, alludes, to, coming, across, gnostic, writings, and, holding, conversations, with, gnostics, and, this, may, have, taken, place, in, asia, minor, or, in, rome, however, it, also, appears, that, gnosticism, was, present, near, lyon, he, writes, that, there, were, followers, of, marcus, the, magician, living, and, teaching, in, the, rhone, valley, little, is, known, about, the, career, of, irenaeus, after, he, became, bishop, the, last, action, reported, of, him, by, eusebius, 150, years, later, is, that, in, 190, or, 191, he, exerted, influence, on, pope, victor, i, not, to, excommunicate, the, christian, communities, of, asia, minor, which, persevered, in, the, practice, of, the, quartodeciman, celebration, of, easter, nothing, is, known, of, the, date, of, his, death, which, must, have, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, second, or, the, beginning, of, the, third, century, he, is, regarded, as, a, martyr, by, the, catholic, church, and, by, some, within, the, orthodox, church, he, was, buried, under, the, church, of, saint, john, in, lyon, which, was, later, renamed, st, irenaeus, in, his, honour, the, church, was, devastated, in, 1562, by, the, huguenots, several, relics, supposedly, of, irenaeus, are, held, in, various, churches, in, lyon, two, crania, from, different, churches, were, dated, by, carbon, 14, to, the, middle, ages, but, a, piece, of, heelbone, kept, in, the, lyon, cathedral, is, from, the, right, time, period, irenaeus, wrote, a, number, of, books, but, the, most, important, that, survives, is, the, against, heresies, or, in, its, latin, title, adversus, haereses, in, book, i, irenaeus, talks, about, the, valentinian, gnostics, and, their, predecessors, who, he, says, go, as, far, back, as, the, magician, simon, magus, in, book, ii, he, attempts, to, provide, proof, that, valentinianism, contains, no, merit, in, terms, of, its, doctrines, in, book, iii, irenaeus, purports, to, show, that, these, doctrines, are, false, by, providing, counter, evidence, gleaned, from, the, gospels, book, iv, consists, of, jesus, s, sayings, and, here, irenaeus, also, stresses, the, unity, of, the, old, testament, and, the, gospel, in, the, final, volume, book, v, irenaeus, focuses, on, more, sayings, of, jesus, plus, the, letters, of, paul, the, apostle, irenaeus, wrote, one, should, not, seek, among, others, the, truth, that, can, be, easily, gotten, from, the, church, for, in, her, as, in, a, rich, treasury, the, apostles, have, placed, all, that, pertains, to, truth, so, that, everyone, can, drink, this, beverage, of, life, she, is, the, door, of, life, but, he, also, said, christ, came, not, only, for, those, who, believed, from, the, time, of, tiberius, caesar, nor, did, the, father, provide, only, for, those, who, are, now, but, for, absolutely, all, men, from, the, beginning, who, according, to, their, ability, feared, and, loved, god, and, lived, justly, and, desired, to, see, christ, and, to, hear, his, voice, the, purpose, of, against, heresies, was, to, refute, the, teachings, of, various, gnostic, groups, apparently, several, greek, merchants, had, begun, an, oratorial, campaign, in, irenaeus, s, bishopric, teaching, that, the, material, world, was, the, accidental, creation, of, an, evil, god, from, which, we, are, to, escape, by, the, pursuit, of, gnosis, irenaeus, argued, that, the, true, gnosis, is, in, fact, knowledge, of, christ, which, redeems, rather, than, escapes, from, bodily, existence, until, the, discovery, of, the, library, of, nag, hammadi, in, 1945, against, heresies, was, the, best, surviving, description, of, gnosticism, some, religious, scholars, have, argued, the, findings, at, nag, hammadi, have, shown, irenaeus, s, description, of, gnosticism, to, be, inaccurate, and, polemic, in, nature, however, the, general, consensus, among, modern, scholars, is, that, irenaeus, was, fairly, accurate, in, his, transmission, of, gnostic, beliefs, and, that, the, nag, hammadi, texts, have, raised, no, substantial, challenges, to, the, overall, accuracy, of, irenaeus, s, information, religious, historian, elaine, pagels, criticizes, irenaeus, for, describing, gnostic, groups, as, sexual, libertines, for, example, when, some, of, their, own, writings, advocated, chastity, more, strongly, than, did, orthodox, texts, however, the, nag, hammadi, texts, do, not, present, a, single, coherent, picture, of, any, unified, gnostic, system, of, belief, but, rather, divergent, beliefs, of, multiple, gnostic, sects, some, of, these, sects, were, indeed, libertine, because, they, considered, bodily, existence, meaningless, others, praised, chastity, and, strongly, prohibited, any, sexual, activity, even, within, marriage, irenaeus, also, wrote, the, demonstration, of, the, apostolic, preaching, also, known, as, proof, of, the, apostolic, preaching, an, armenian, copy, of, which, was, discovered, in, 1904, this, work, seems, to, have, been, an, instruction, for, recent, christian, converts, eusebius, attests, to, other, works, by, irenaeus, today, lost, including, on, the, ogdoad, an, untitled, letter, to, blastus, regarding, schism, on, the, subject, of, knowledge, on, the, monarchy, or, how, god, is, not, the, cause, of, evil, on, easter, irenaeus, exercised, wide, influence, on, the, generation, which, followed, both, hippolytus, and, tertullian, freely, drew, on, his, writings, however, none, of, his, works, aside, from, against, heresies, and, the, demonstration, of, the, apostolic, preaching, survive, today, perhaps, because, his, literal, hope, of, an, earthly, millennium, may, have, made, him, uncongenial, reading, in, the, greek, east, even, though, no, complete, version, of, against, heresies, in, its, original, greek, exists, we, possess, the, full, ancient, latin, version, probably, of, the, third, century, as, well, as, thirty, three, fragments, of, a, syrian, version, and, a, complete, armenian, version, of, books, 4, and, 5, evelyn, underhill, in, her, book, mysticism, credited, irenaeus, as, being, one, of, those, to, whom, we, owe, the, preservation, of, that, mighty, system, of, scaffolding, which, enabled, the, catholic, mystics, to, build, up, the, towers, and, bulwarks, of, the, city, of, god, irenaeus, s, works, were, first, translated, into, english, by, john, keble, and, published, in, 1872, as, part, of, the, library, of, the, fathers, series, irenaeus, pointed, to, the, public, rule, of, faith, authoritatively, articulated, by, the, preaching, of, bishops, and, inculcated, in, church, practice, especially, worship, as, an, authentic, apostolic, tradition, by, which, to, read, scripture, truly, against, heresies, he, classified, as, scripture, not, only, the, old, testament, but, most, of, the, books, now, known, as, the, new, testament, while, excluding, many, works, a, large, number, by, gnostics, that, flourished, in, the, 2nd, century, and, claimed, scriptural, authority, oftentimes, irenaeus, as, a, student, of, polycarp, who, was, a, direct, disciple, of, the, apostle, john, believed, that, he, was, interpreting, scriptures, in, the, same, hermeneutic, as, the, apostles, this, connection, to, jesus, was, important, to, irenaeus, because, both, he, and, the, gnostics, based, their, arguments, on, scripture, irenaeus, argued, that, since, he, could, trace, his, authority, to, jesus, and, the, gnostics, could, not, his, interpretation, of, scripture, was, correct, he, also, used, the, rule, of, faith, a, proto, creed, with, similarities, to, the, apostles, creed, as, a, hermeneutical, key, to, argue, that, his, interpretation, of, scripture, was, correct, before, irenaeus, christians, differed, as, to, which, gospel, they, preferred, the, christians, of, asia, minor, preferred, the, gospel, of, john, the, gospel, of, matthew, was, the, most, popular, overall, irenaeus, asserted, that, all, four, of, the, gospels, john, luke, matthew, and, mark, which, is, the, order, presented, in, his, four, pillar, narrative, in, adversus, haereses, against, heresies, iii, 11, 8, were, canonical, scripture, thus, irenaeus, provides, the, earliest, witness, to, the, assertion, of, the, four, canonical, gospels, possibly, in, reaction, to, marcion, s, edited, version, of, the, gospel, of, luke, which, marcion, asserted, was, the, one, and, only, true, gospel, based, on, the, arguments, irenaeus, made, in, support, of, only, four, authentic, gospels, some, interpreters, deduce, that, the, fourfold, gospel, must, have, still, been, a, novelty, in, irenaeus, s, time, against, heresies, 3, 11, 7, acknowledges, that, many, heterodox, christians, use, only, one, gospel, while, 3, 11, 9, acknowledges, that, some, use, more, than, four, the, success, of, tatian, s, diatessaron, in, about, the, same, time, period, is, a, powerful, indication, that, the, fourfold, gospel, contemporaneously, sponsored, by, irenaeus, was, not, broadly, let, alone, universally, recognized, the, apologist, and, ascetic, tatian, had, previously, harmonized, the, four, gospels, into, a, single, narrative, the, diatesseron, c, 150, 160, irenaeus, is, also, the, earliest, attestation, that, the, gospel, of, john, was, written, by, john, the, apostle, and, that, the, gospel, of, luke, was, written, by, luke, the, companion, of, paul, scholars, contend, that, irenaeus, quotes, from, 21, of, the, 27, new, testament, books, such, as, he, may, refer, to, hebrews, 2, 30, and, james, 4, 16, and, maybe, even, 2, peter, 5, 28, but, does, not, cite, philemon, irenaeus, cited, the, new, testament, approximately, 1, 000, times, about, one, third, of, his, citations, are, made, to, paul, s, letters, irenaeus, considered, all, 13, letters, belonging, to, the, pauline, corpus, to, have, been, written, by, paul, himself, in, his, writing, against, the, gnostics, who, claimed, to, possess, a, secret, oral, tradition, from, jesus, himself, irenaeus, maintained, that, the, bishops, in, different, cities, are, known, as, far, back, as, the, apostles, and, that, the, oral, tradition, he, lists, from, the, apostles, is, a, safe, guide, to, the, interpretation, of, scripture, in, a, passage, that, became, a, locus, classicus, of, catholic, protestant, polemics, he, cited, the, roman, church, as, an, example, of, the, unbroken, chain, of, authority, which, text, catholic, polemics, would, use, to, assert, the, primacy, of, rome, over, eastern, churches, by, virtue, of, its, preeminent, authority, the, succession, of, bishops, and, presbyters, was, important, to, establish, a, chain, of, custody, for, orthodoxy, irenaeus, s, point, when, refuting, the, gnostics, was, that, all, of, the, apostolic, churches, had, preserved, the, same, traditions, and, teachings, in, many, independent, streams, it, was, the, unanimous, agreement, between, these, many, independent, streams, of, transmission, that, proved, the, orthodox, faith, current, in, those, churches, to, be, true, the, central, point, of, irenaeus, s, theology, is, the, unity, and, the, goodness, of, god, in, opposition, to, the, gnostics, theory, of, god, a, number, of, divine, emanations, aeons, along, with, a, distinction, between, the, monad, and, the, demiurge, irenaeus, uses, the, logos, theology, he, inherited, from, justin, martyr, irenaeus, was, a, student, of, polycarp, who, was, said, to, have, been, tutored, by, john, the, apostle, john, had, used, logos, terminology, in, the, gospel, of, john, and, the, letter, of, 1, john, irenaeus, often, spoke, of, the, son, and, the, spirit, as, the, hands, of, god, though, he, also, spoke, of, the, son, as, the, logos, irenaeus, s, emphasis, on, the, unity, of, god, is, reflected, in, his, corresponding, emphasis, on, the, unity, of, salvation, history, irenaeus, repeatedly, insists, that, god, began, the, world, and, has, been, overseeing, it, ever, since, this, creative, act, everything, that, has, happened, is, part, of, his, plan, for, humanity, the, essence, of, this, plan, is, a, process, of, maturation, irenaeus, believes, that, humanity, was, created, immature, and, god, intended, his, creatures, to, take, a, long, time, to, grow, into, or, assume, the, divine, likeness, everything, that, has, happened, since, has, therefore, been, planned, by, god, to, help, humanity, overcome, this, initial, mishap, and, achieve, spiritual, maturity, the, world, has, been, intentionally, designed, by, god, as, a, difficult, place, where, human, beings, are, forced, to, make, moral, decisions, as, only, in, this, way, can, they, mature, as, moral, agents, irenaeus, likens, death, to, the, big, fish, that, swallowed, jonah, it, was, only, in, the, depths, of, the, whale, s, belly, that, jonah, could, turn, to, god, and, act, according, to, the, divine, will, similarly, death, and, suffering, appear, as, evils, but, without, them, we, could, never, come, to, know, god, according, to, irenaeus, the, high, point, in, salvation, history, is, the, advent, of, jesus, for, irenaeus, the, incarnation, of, christ, was, intended, by, god, before, he, determined, that, humanity, would, be, created, irenaeus, develops, this, idea, based, on, rom, 5, 14, saying, forinasmuch, as, he, had, a, pre, existence, as, a, saving, being, it, was, necessary, that, what, might, be, saved, should, also, be, called, into, existence, in, order, that, the, being, who, saves, should, not, exist, in, vain, some, theologians, maintain, that, irenaeus, believed, that, incarnation, would, have, occurred, even, if, humanity, had, never, sinned, but, the, fact, that, they, did, sin, determined, his, role, as, the, savior, irenaeus, sees, christ, as, the, new, adam, who, systematically, undoes, what, adam, did, thus, where, adam, was, disobedient, concerning, god, s, edict, concerning, the, fruit, of, the, tree, of, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, christ, was, obedient, even, to, death, on, the, wood, of, a, tree, irenaeus, is, the, first, to, draw, comparisons, between, eve, and, mary, contrasting, the, faithlessness, of, the, former, with, the, faithfulness, of, the, latter, in, addition, to, reversing, the, wrongs, done, by, adam, irenaeus, thinks, of, christ, as, recapitulating, or, summing, up, human, life, irenaeus, conceives, of, our, salvation, as, essentially, coming, about, through, the, incarnation, of, god, as, a, man, he, characterizes, the, penalty, for, sin, as, death, and, corruption, god, however, is, immortal, and, incorruptible, and, simply, by, becoming, united, to, human, nature, in, christ, he, conveys, those, qualities, to, us, they, spread, as, it, were, like, a, benign, infection, irenaeus, emphasizes, that, salvation, occurs, through, christ, s, incarnation, which, bestows, incorruptibility, on, humanity, rather, than, emphasizing, his, redemptive, death, in, the, crucifixion, although, the, latter, event, is, an, integral, part, of, the, former, part, of, the, process, of, recapitulation, is, for, christ, to, go, through, every, stage, of, human, life, from, infancy, to, old, age, and, simply, by, living, it, sanctify, it, with, his, divinity, although, it, is, sometimes, claimed, that, irenaeus, believed, christ, did, not, die, until, he, was, older, than, is, conventionally, portrayed, the, bishop, of, lyon, simply, pointed, out, that, because, jesus, turned, the, permissible, age, for, becoming, a, rabbi, 30, years, old, and, above, he, recapitulated, and, sanctified, the, period, between, 30, and, 50, years, old, as, per, the, jewish, custom, of, periodization, on, life, and, so, touches, the, beginning, of, old, age, when, one, becomes, 50, years, old, see, adversus, haereses, book, ii, chapter, 22, in, the, passage, of, adversus, haereses, under, consideration, irenaeus, is, clear, that, after, receiving, baptism, at, the, age, of, thirty, citing, luke, 3, 23, gnostics, then, falsely, assert, that, he, preached, only, one, year, reckoning, from, his, baptism, and, also, on, completing, his, thirtieth, year, he, suffered, being, in, fact, still, a, young, man, and, who, had, by, no, means, attained, to, advanced, age, irenaeus, argues, against, the, gnostics, by, using, scripture, to, add, several, years, after, his, baptism, by, referencing, 3, distinctly, separate, visits, to, jerusalem, the, first, is, when, jesus, makes, wine, out, of, water, he, goes, up, to, the, paschal, feast, day, after, which, he, withdraws, and, is, found, in, samaria, the, second, is, when, jesus, goes, up, to, jerusalem, for, passover, and, cures, the, paralytic, after, which, he, withdraws, over, the, sea, of, tiberias, the, third, mention, is, when, he, travels, to, jerusalem, eats, the, passover, and, suffers, on, the, following, day, irenaeus, quotes, scripture, john, 8, 57, to, suggest, that, jesus, ministers, while, in, his, 40s, in, this, passage, jesus, s, opponents, want, to, argue, that, jesus, has, not, seen, abraham, because, jesus, is, too, young, jesus, s, opponents, argue, that, jesus, was, not, yet, 50, years, old, irenaeus, argues, that, if, jesus, were, in, his, thirties, his, opponents, would, have, argued, that, he, was, not, yet, 40, years, old, since, that, would, make, him, even, younger, irenaeus, s, argument, is, that, they, would, not, weaken, their, own, argument, by, adding, years, to, jesus, s, age, irenaeus, also, writes, the, elders, witness, to, this, who, in, asia, conferred, with, john, the, lord, s, disciple, to, the, effect, that, john, had, delivered, these, things, unto, them, for, he, abode, with, them, until, the, times, of, trajan, and, some, of, them, saw, not, only, john, but, others, also, of, the, apostles, and, had, this, same, account, from, them, and, witness, to, the, aforesaid, relation, in, demonstration, 74, irenaeus, notes, for, pontius, pilate, was, governor, of, jud, a, and, he, had, at, that, time, resentful, enmity, against, herod, the, king, of, the, jews, but, then, when, christ, was, brought, to, him, bound, pilate, sent, him, to, herod, giving, command, to, enquire, of, him, that, he, might, know, of, a, certainty, what, he, should, desire, concerning, him, making, christ, a, convenient, occasion, of, reconciliation, with, the, king, pilate, was, the, prefect, of, the, roman, province, of, judaea, from, ad, 26, 36, he, served, under, emperor, tiberius, claudius, nero, herod, antipas, was, tetrarch, of, galilee, and, perea, a, client, state, of, the, roman, empire, he, ruled, from, 4, bc, to, 39, ad, in, refuting, gnostic, claims, that, jesus, preached, for, only, one, year, after, his, baptism, irenaeus, used, the, recapitulation, approach, to, demonstrate, that, by, living, beyond, the, age, of, thirty, christ, sanctified, even, old, age, many, aspects, of, irenaeus, s, presentation, of, salvation, history, depend, on, paul, s, epistles, irenaeus, s, conception, of, salvation, relies, heavily, on, the, understanding, found, in, paul, s, letters, irenaeus, first, brings, up, the, theme, of, victory, over, sin, and, evil, that, is, afforded, by, jesus, s, death, god, s, intervention, has, saved, humanity, from, the, fall, of, adam, and, the, wickedness, of, satan, human, nature, has, become, joined, with, god, s, in, the, person, of, jesus, thus, allowing, human, nature, to, have, victory, over, sin, paul, writes, on, the, same, theme, that, christ, has, come, so, that, a, new, order, is, formed, and, being, under, the, law, is, being, under, the, sin, of, adam, reconciliation, is, also, a, theme, of, paul, s, that, irenaeus, stresses, in, his, teachings, on, salvation, irenaeus, believes, jesus, coming, in, flesh, and, blood, sanctified, humanity, so, that, it, might, again, reflect, the, perfection, associated, with, the, likeness, of, the, divine, this, perfection, leads, to, a, new, life, in, the, lineage, of, god, which, is, forever, striving, for, eternal, life, and, unity, with, the, father, this, is, a, carryover, from, paul, who, attributes, this, reconciliation, to, the, actions, of, christ, for, since, death, came, through, a, human, being, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, has, also, come, through, a, human, being, for, as, all, die, in, adam, so, all, will, be, made, alive, in, christ, a, third, theme, in, both, paul, s, and, irenaeus, s, conceptions, of, salvation, is, the, sacrifice, of, christ, being, necessary, for, the, new, life, given, to, humanity, in, the, triumph, over, evil, it, is, in, this, obedient, sacrifice, that, jesus, is, victor, and, reconciler, thus, erasing, the, marks, that, adam, left, on, human, nature, to, argue, against, the, gnostics, on, this, point, irenaeus, uses, colossians, in, showing, that, the, debt, which, came, by, a, tree, has, been, paid, for, us, in, another, tree, furthermore, the, first, chapter, of, ephesians, is, picked, up, in, irenaeus, s, discussion, of, the, topic, when, he, asserts, by, his, own, blood, he, redeemed, us, as, also, his, apostle, declares, in, whom, we, have, redemption, through, his, blood, even, the, remission, of, sins, the, frequencies, of, quotations, and, allusions, to, the, pauline, epistles, in, against, heresies, are, to, counter, his, gnostic, opponents, irenaeus, significantly, develops, paul, s, presentation, of, christ, as, the, last, adam, irenaeus, s, presentation, of, christ, as, the, new, adam, is, based, on, paul, s, christ, adam, parallel, in, romans, 5, 12, 21, irenaeus, uses, this, parallel, to, demonstrate, that, christ, truly, took, human, flesh, irenaeus, considered, it, important, to, emphasize, this, point, because, he, understands, the, failure, to, recognize, christ, s, full, humanity, the, bond, linking, the, various, strains, of, gnosticism, together, as, seen, in, his, statement, that, according, to, the, opinion, of, no, one, of, the, heretics, was, the, word, of, god, made, flesh, irenaeus, believes, that, unless, the, word, became, flesh, humans, were, not, fully, redeemed, he, explains, that, by, becoming, man, christ, restored, humanity, to, being, in, the, image, and, likeness, of, god, which, they, had, lost, in, the, fall, of, man, just, as, adam, was, the, original, head, of, humanity, through, whom, all, sinned, christ, is, the, new, head, of, humanity, who, fulfills, adam, s, role, in, the, economy, of, salvation, irenaeus, calls, this, process, of, restoring, humanity, recapitulation, for, irenaeus, paul, s, presentation, of, the, old, law, the, mosaic, covenant, in, this, passage, indicates, that, the, old, law, revealed, humanity, s, sinfulness, but, could, not, save, them, he, explains, that, for, as, the, law, was, spiritual, it, merely, made, sin, to, stand, out, in, relief, but, did, not, destroy, it, for, sin, had, no, dominion, over, the, spirit, but, over, man, since, humans, have, a, physical, nature, they, cannot, be, saved, by, a, spiritual, law, instead, they, need, a, human, savior, this, is, why, it, was, necessary, for, christ, to, take, human, flesh, irenaeus, summarizes, how, christ, s, taking, human, flesh, saves, humanity, with, a, statement, that, closely, resembles, romans, 5, 19, for, as, by, the, disobedience, of, the, one, man, who, was, originally, moulded, from, virgin, soil, the, many, were, made, sinners, and, forfeited, life, so, was, it, necessary, that, by, the, obedience, of, one, man, who, was, originally, born, from, a, virgin, many, should, be, justified, and, receive, salvation, the, physical, creation, of, adam, and, christ, is, emphasized, by, irenaeus, to, demonstrate, how, the, incarnation, saves, humanity, s, physical, nature, irenaeus, emphasizes, the, importance, of, christ, s, reversal, of, adam, s, action, through, his, obedience, christ, undoes, adam, s, disobedience, irenaeus, presents, the, passion, as, the, climax, of, christ, s, obedience, emphasizing, how, this, obedience, on, the, tree, of, the, cross, undoes, the, disobedience, that, occurred, through, a, tree, irenaeus, s, interpretation, of, paul, s, discussion, of, christ, as, the, new, adam, is, significant, because, it, helped, develop, the, recapitulation, theory, of, atonement, irenaeus, emphasizes, that, it, is, through, christ, s, reversal, of, adam, s, action, that, humanity, is, saved, rather, than, considering, the, redemption, to, occur, in, a, cultic, or, juridical, way, the, biblical, passage, death, has, been, swallowed, up, in, victory, implied, for, irenaeus, that, the, lord, will, surely, resurrect, the, first, human, i, e, adam, as, one, of, the, saved, according, to, irenaeus, those, who, deny, adam, s, salvation, are, shutting, themselves, out, from, life, for, ever, and, the, first, one, who, did, so, was, tatian, the, notion, that, the, second, adam, saved, the, first, adam, was, advocated, not, only, by, irenaeus, but, also, by, gregory, thaumaturgus, which, suggests, that, it, was, popular, in, the, early, church, valentinian, gnosticism, was, one, of, the, major, forms, of, gnosticism, that, irenaeus, opposed, according, to, the, gnostic, view, of, salvation, creation, was, perfect, to, begin, with, it, did, not, need, time, to, grow, and, mature, for, the, valentinians, the, material, world, is, the, result, of, the, loss, of, perfection, which, resulted, from, sophia, s, desire, to, understand, the, forefather, therefore, one, is, ultimately, redeemed, through, secret, knowledge, to, enter, the, pleroma, of, which, the, achamoth, originally, fell, according, to, the, valentinian, gnostics, there, are, three, classes, of, human, beings, they, are, the, material, who, cannot, attain, salvation, the, psychic, who, are, strengthened, by, works, and, faith, they, are, part, of, the, church, and, the, spiritual, who, cannot, decay, or, be, harmed, by, material, actions, essentially, ordinary, humans, those, who, have, faith, but, do, not, possess, the, special, knowledge, will, not, attain, salvation, spirituals, on, the, other, hand, those, who, obtain, this, great, gift, are, the, only, class, that, will, eventually, attain, salvation, in, his, article, entitled, the, demiurge, j, p, arendzen, sums, up, the, valentinian, view, of, the, salvation, of, man, he, writes, the, first, or, carnal, men, will, return, to, the, grossness, of, matter, and, finally, be, consumed, by, fire, the, second, or, psychic, men, together, with, the, demiurge, as, their, master, will, enter, a, middle, state, neither, heaven, pleroma, nor, hell, whyle, the, purely, spiritual, men, will, be, completely, freed, from, the, influence, of, the, demiurge, and, together, with, the, saviour, and, achamoth, his, spouse, will, enter, the, pleroma, divested, of, body, h, le, and, soul, psuch, in, this, understanding, of, salvation, the, purpose, of, the, incarnation, was, to, redeem, the, spirituals, from, their, material, bodies, by, taking, a, material, body, the, son, becomes, the, savior, and, facilitates, this, entrance, into, the, pleroma, by, making, it, possible, for, the, spirituals, to, receive, his, spiritual, body, however, in, becoming, a, body, and, soul, the, son, himself, becomes, one, of, those, needing, redemption, therefore, the, word, descends, onto, the, savior, at, his, baptism, in, the, jordan, which, liberates, the, son, from, his, corruptible, body, and, soul, his, redemption, from, the, body, and, soul, is, then, applied, to, the, spirituals, in, response, to, this, gnostic, view, of, christ, irenaeus, emphasized, that, the, word, became, flesh, and, developed, a, soteriology, that, emphasized, the, significance, of, christ, s, material, body, in, saving, humanity, as, discussed, in, the, sections, above, in, his, criticism, of, gnosticism, irenaeus, made, reference, to, a, gnostic, gospel, which, portrayed, judas, in, a, positive, light, as, having, acted, in, accordance, with, jesus, s, instructions, the, recently, discovered, gospel, of, judas, dates, close, to, the, period, when, irenaeus, lived, late, 2nd, century, and, scholars, typically, regard, this, work, as, one, of, many, gnostic, texts, showing, one, of, many, varieties, of, gnostic, beliefs, of, the, period, irenaeus, took, part, in, the, quartodeciman, controversy, when, victor, i, of, rome, tried, to, force, a, universal, practice, of, fasting, until, easter, to, supersede, the, jewish, practice, and, prevent, christians, from, partaking, of, the, passover, polycrates, who, led, the, churches, of, asia, minor, continued, to, hold, old, traditions, of, the, paschal, feast, for, this, reason, victor, i, wanted, to, excommunicate, polycrates, and, his, supporters, but, this, was, a, step, too, far, for, irenaeus, and, other, bishops
