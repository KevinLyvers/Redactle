alessandro, giuseppe, antonio, anastasio, volta, v, o, l, t, v, l, t, italian, 18, february, 1745, 5, march, 1827, was, an, italian, physicist, and, chemist, who, was, a, pioneer, of, electricity, and, power, and, is, credited, as, the, inventor, of, the, electric, battery, and, the, discoverer, of, methane, he, invented, the, voltaic, pile, in, 1799, and, reported, the, results, of, his, experiments, in, a, two, part, letter, to, the, president, of, the, royal, society, which, was, published, in, 1800, with, this, invention, volta, proved, that, electricity, could, be, generated, chemically, and, debunked, the, prevalent, theory, that, electricity, was, generated, solely, by, living, beings, volta, s, invention, sparked, a, great, amount, of, scientific, excitement, and, led, others, to, conduct, similar, experiments, which, eventually, led, to, the, development, of, the, field, of, electrochemistry, volta, drew, admiration, from, napoleon, bonaparte, for, his, invention, and, was, invited, to, the, institute, of, france, to, demonstrate, his, invention, to, the, members, of, the, institute, throughout, his, life, volta, enjoyed, a, certain, amount, of, closeness, with, the, emperor, who, conferred, upon, him, numerous, honours, volta, held, the, chair, of, experimental, physics, at, the, university, of, pavia, for, nearly, 40, years, and, was, widely, idolised, by, his, students, despite, his, professional, success, volta, was, inclined, towards, domestic, life, and, this, was, more, apparent, in, his, later, years, when, he, tended, to, live, secluded, from, public, life, and, more, for, the, sake, of, his, family, he, died, in, 1827, from, a, series, of, illnesses, which, began, in, 1823, the, si, unit, of, electric, potential, is, named, the, volt, in, his, honour, volta, was, born, in, como, a, town, in, northern, italy, on, 18, february, 1745, his, father, filippo, volta, was, of, noble, lineage, his, mother, donna, maddalena, came, from, the, family, of, the, inzaghis, in, 1794, volta, married, an, aristocratic, lady, also, from, como, teresa, peregrini, with, whom, he, raised, three, sons, zanino, flaminio, and, luigi, in, 1774, he, became, a, professor, of, physics, at, the, royal, school, in, como, a, year, later, he, improved, and, popularised, the, electrophorus, a, device, that, produced, static, electricity, his, promotion, of, it, was, so, extensive, that, he, is, often, credited, with, its, invention, even, though, a, machine, operating, on, the, same, principle, was, described, in, 1762, by, the, swedish, experimenter, johan, wilcke, in, 1777, he, travelled, through, switzerland, where, he, befriended, h, b, de, saussure, in, the, years, between, 1776, and, 1778, volta, studied, the, chemistry, of, gases, he, researched, and, discovered, methane, after, reading, a, paper, by, benjamin, franklin, of, the, united, states, on, flammable, air, in, november, 1776, he, found, methane, in, the, marshes, of, angera, on, lake, maggiore, and, by, 1778, he, managed, to, isolate, it, he, devised, experiments, such, as, the, ignition, of, methane, by, an, electric, spark, in, a, closed, vessel, volta, also, studied, what, we, now, call, electrical, capacitance, developing, separate, means, to, study, both, electrical, potential, difference, v, and, charge, q, and, discovering, that, for, a, given, object, they, are, proportional, this, is, called, volta, s, law, of, capacitance, and, for, this, work, the, unit, of, electrical, potential, has, been, named, the, volt, in, 1779, he, became, a, professor, of, experimental, physics, at, the, university, of, pavia, a, chair, that, he, occupied, for, almost, 40, years, volta, s, lectures, were, so, crowded, with, students, that, the, subsequent, emperor, joseph, ii, ordered, the, construction, based, on, a, project, by, leopold, pollack, of, a, new, physical, theatre, today, the, aula, volta, furthermore, the, emperor, granted, volta, substantial, funding, to, equip, the, physics, cabinet, with, instruments, purchased, by, volta, in, england, and, france, at, the, university, history, museum, of, the, university, of, pavia, there, are, 150, of, them, used, by, alessandro, volta, luigi, galvani, an, italian, physicist, discovered, something, he, named, animal, electricity, when, two, different, metals, were, connected, in, series, with, a, frog, s, leg, and, to, one, another, volta, realised, that, the, frog, s, leg, served, as, both, a, conductor, of, electricity, what, we, would, now, call, an, electrolyte, and, as, a, detector, of, electricity, he, also, understood, that, the, frog, s, legs, were, irrelevant, to, the, electric, current, which, was, caused, by, the, two, differing, metals, he, replaced, the, frog, s, leg, with, brine, soaked, paper, and, detected, the, flow, of, electricity, by, other, means, familiar, to, him, from, his, previous, studies, in, this, way, he, discovered, the, electrochemical, series, and, the, law, that, the, electromotive, force, emf, of, a, galvanic, cell, consisting, of, a, pair, of, metal, electrodes, separated, by, electrolyte, is, the, difference, between, their, two, electrode, potentials, thus, two, identical, electrodes, and, a, common, electrolyte, give, zero, net, emf, this, may, be, called, volta, s, law, of, the, electrochemical, series, in, 1800, as, the, result, of, a, professional, disagreement, over, the, galvanic, response, advocated, by, galvani, volta, invented, the, voltaic, pile, an, early, electric, battery, which, produced, a, steady, electric, current, volta, had, determined, that, the, most, effective, pair, of, dissimilar, metals, to, produce, electricity, was, zinc, and, copper, initially, he, experimented, with, individual, cells, in, series, each, cell, being, a, wine, goblet, filled, with, brine, into, which, the, two, dissimilar, electrodes, were, dipped, the, voltaic, pile, replaced, the, goblets, with, cardboard, soaked, in, brine, in, announcing, his, discovery, of, the, voltaic, pile, volta, paid, tribute, to, the, influences, of, william, nicholson, tiberius, cavallo, and, abraham, bennet, the, battery, made, by, volta, is, credited, as, one, of, the, first, electrochemical, cells, it, consists, of, two, electrodes, one, made, of, zinc, the, other, of, copper, the, electrolyte, is, either, sulfuric, acid, mixed, with, water, or, a, form, of, saltwater, brine, the, electrolyte, exists, in, the, form, 2, h, and, so, 2, 4, zinc, metal, which, is, higher, in, the, electrochemical, series, than, both, copper, and, hydrogen, is, oxidized, to, zinc, cations, zn, 2, and, creates, electrons, that, move, to, the, copper, electrode, the, positively, charged, hydrogen, ions, protons, capture, electrons, from, the, copper, electrode, forming, bubbles, of, hydrogen, gas, h, 2, this, makes, the, zinc, rod, the, negative, electrode, and, the, copper, rod, the, positive, electrode, thus, there, are, two, terminals, and, an, electric, current, will, flow, if, they, are, connected, the, chemical, reactions, in, this, voltaic, cell, are, as, follows, copper, metal, does, not, react, but, rather, it, functions, as, a, catalyst, for, the, hydrogen, gas, formation, and, an, electrode, for, the, electric, current, the, sulfate, anion, so, 2, 4, does, not, undergo, any, chemical, reaction, either, but, migrates, to, the, zinc, anode, to, compensate, for, the, charge, of, the, zinc, cations, formed, there, however, this, cell, also, has, some, disadvantages, it, is, unsafe, to, handle, since, sulfuric, acid, even, if, diluted, can, be, hazardous, also, the, power, of, the, cell, diminishes, over, time, because, the, hydrogen, gas, is, not, released, instead, it, accumulates, on, the, surface, of, the, copper, electrode, and, forms, a, barrier, between, the, metal, and, the, electrolyte, solution, in, 1809, volta, became, an, associated, member, of, the, royal, institute, of, the, netherlands, in, honour, of, his, work, volta, was, made, a, count, by, napoleon, bonaparte, in, 1810, volta, retired, in, 1819, to, his, estate, in, camnago, a, frazione, of, como, italy, now, named, camnago, volta, in, his, honour, he, died, there, on, 5, march, 1827, just, after, his, 82nd, birthday, volta, s, remains, were, buried, in, camnago, volta, volta, s, legacy, is, celebrated, by, the, tempio, voltiano, memorial, located, in, the, public, gardens, by, the, lake, there, is, also, a, museum, that, was, built, in, his, honour, which, exhibits, some, of, the, equipment, that, volta, used, to, conduct, experiments, nearby, stands, the, villa, olmo, which, houses, the, voltian, foundation, an, organization, promoting, scientific, activities, volta, carried, out, his, experimental, studies, and, produced, his, first, inventions, near, como, in, the, old, campus, of, the, university, of, pavia, there, is, the, classroom, aula, volta, commissioned, by, emperor, joseph, ii, to, leopoldo, pollack, in, 1787, for, the, lectures, of, alessandro, volta, while, in, the, university, history, museum, there, are, many, scientific, instruments, that, belonged, to, volta, and, his, chair, and, his, blackboard, his, image, was, depicted, on, the, italian, lire, 10, 000, note, 1990, 1997, along, with, a, sketch, of, his, voltaic, pile, in, late, 2017, nvidia, announced, a, new, workstation, focused, gpu, microarchitecture, called, volta, the, electric, eel, species, electrophorus, voltai, described, in, 2019, and, the, strongest, bioelectricity, producer, in, nature, was, named, after, volta, volta, was, raised, as, a, catholic, and, for, all, of, his, life, continued, to, maintain, his, belief, because, he, was, not, ordained, a, clergyman, as, his, family, expected, he, was, sometimes, accused, of, being, irreligious, and, some, people, have, speculated, about, his, possible, unbelief, stressing, that, he, did, not, join, the, church, or, that, he, virtually, ignored, the, church, s, call, nevertheless, he, cast, out, doubts, in, a, declaration, of, faith, in, which, he, said, i, do, not, understand, how, anyone, can, doubt, the, sincerity, and, constancy, of, my, attachment, to, the, religion, which, i, profess, the, roman, catholic, and, apostolic, religion, in, which, i, was, born, and, brought, up, and, of, which, i, have, always, made, confession, externally, and, internally, i, have, indeed, and, only, too, often, failed, in, the, performance, of, those, good, works, which, are, the, mark, of, a, catholic, christian, and, i, have, been, guilty, of, many, sins, but, through, the, special, mercy, of, god, i, have, never, as, far, as, i, know, wavered, in, my, faith, in, this, faith, i, recognise, a, pure, gift, of, god, a, supernatural, grace, but, i, have, not, neglected, those, human, means, which, confirm, belief, and, overthrow, the, doubts, which, at, times, arise, i, studied, attentively, the, grounds, and, basis, of, religion, the, works, of, apologists, and, assailants, the, reasons, for, and, against, and, i, can, say, that, the, result, of, such, study, is, to, clothe, religion, with, such, a, degree, of, probability, even, for, the, merely, natural, reason, that, every, spirit, unperverted, by, sin, and, passion, every, naturally, noble, spirit, must, love, and, accept, it, may, this, confession, which, has, been, asked, from, me, and, which, i, willingly, give, written, and, subscribed, by, my, own, hand, with, authority, to, show, it, to, whomsoever, you, will, for, i, am, not, ashamed, of, the, gospel, may, it, produce, some, good, fruit
