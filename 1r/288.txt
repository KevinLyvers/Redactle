children, and, lives, in, the, south, of, france, gordimer, also, spent, time, with, her, family, in, france, as, she, and, cassirer, had, bought, a, small, hilltop, home, near, nice, in, a, 1979, 80, interview, gordimer, who, was, jewish, identified, herself, as, an, atheist, but, added, i, think, i, have, a, basically, religious, temperament, perhaps, even, a, profoundly, religious, one, she, was, not, involved, in, jewish, communal, life, though, both, her, husbands, were, jewish, in, a, 1996, interview, she, said, the, only, time, i, seriously, enquired, into, religion, was, in, my, mid, thirties, when, i, experienced, a, strange, kind, of, loss, or, lack, in, myself, and, thought, this, may, be, because, i, had, no, religion, she, read, teilhard, de, chardin, simone, weil, and, books, about, world, religions, continuing, for, the, first, time, in, my, life, i, learned, something, about, judaism, the, religion, of, my, parents, but, it, didn, t, happen, i, could, not, take, the, leap, of, faith, she, did, however, feel, that, her, moral, values, emerged, from, the, judeo, christian, tradition, she, did, not, feel, that, being, from, an, oppressed, people, was, the, reason, that, she, was, engaged, in, the, anti, apartheid, struggle, i, get, rather, annoyed, when, people, suggest, that, my, engagement, in, the, anti, apartheid, struggle, can, somehow, be, traced, back, to, my, jewishness, i, refuse, to, accept, that, one, must, oneself, have, been, exposed, to, prejudice, and, exploitation, to, be, opposed, to, it, i, like, to, think, that, all, decent, people, whatever, their, religious, or, ethnic, background, have, an, equal, responsibility, to, fight, what, is, evil, to, say, otherwise, is, to, concede, too, much, in, 2008, gordimer, defended, her, decision, to, attend, a, jerusalem, writers, conference, in, israel, gordimer, could, be, critical, of, israel, but, rejected, comparison, of, its, policies, to, apartheid, in, south, africa,

friends, had, emigrated, she, had, no, plans, to, leave, south, africa, permanently, it, s, always, been, a, nightmare, in, my, mind, to, be, cut, off, ronald, suresh, roberts, published, a, biography, of, gordimer, no, cold, kitchen, in, 2006, she, had, granted, roberts, interviews, and, access, to, her, personal, papers, with, an, understanding, that, she, would, authorise, the, biography, in, return, for, a, right, to, review, the, manuscript, before, publication, however, gordimer, and, roberts, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, over, his, account, of, the, illness, and, death, of, gordimer, s, husband, reinhold, cassirer, and, an, affair, gordimer, had, in, the, 1950s, as, well, as, criticism, of, her, views, on, the, israel, palestine, conflict, gordimer, disowned,

and, truth, gordimer, tells, stories, of, ordinary, people, revealing, moral, ambiguities, and, choices, her, characterisation, is, nuanced, revealed, more, through, the, choices, her, characters,

her, body, of, work, it, s, impossible, to, guess, from, the, books, alone, that, gordimer, was, jewish, and, it, would, be, easy, to, assume, the, contrary, since, whenever, jews, do, appear, in,

ineluctable, cultural, component, of, individual, identity, and, expressed, as, an, aspect, of, the, nominally, jewish, writer, s, particular, unique, quest, for, identity, in, a, heterogeneous, society, benjamin, ivry, writing, in, the, forward, highlighted, several, examples, where, gordimer, employed, jewish, characters, and, themes, gordimer, proved, that, indeed, anything, was, possible, when, examining, the, personal, significance, of, yiddishkeit, in, 1951, she, wrote, a, watcher, of, the, dead, for, the, new, yorker, it, centres, on, the, death, of, a, jewish, grandmother, and,
