continuing, to, serve, traditional, religious, patrons, his, late, gothic, style, was, enriched, by, artistic, trends, in, italy, france, and, the, netherlands, as, well, as, by, renaissance, humanism, the, result, was, a, combined, aesthetic, uniquely, his, own, holbein, travelled, to, england, in, 1526, in, search, of, work, with, a, recommendation, from, erasmus, he, was, welcomed,

time, a, typical, accolade, at, the, time, holbein, has, also, been, described, as, a, great, one, off, in, art, history, since, he, founded, no, school, some, of, his, work, was, lost, after, his, death, but, much, was, collected, and, he, was, recognized, among, the, great, portrait, masters, by, the, 19th, century, recent, exhibitions, have, also, highlighted, his, versatility, he, created, designs, ranging, from, intricate, jewellery, to, monumental, frescoes, holbein, s, art, has, sometimes, been, called, realist, since, he, drew, and, painted, with, a, rare, precision, his, portraits, were, renowned, in, their, time, for, their, likeness, and, it, is, through, his, eyes, that, many, famous, figures, of, his, day, are, pictured, today, such, as, erasmus, and, more, he, was, never, content, with, outward, appearance, however, he, embedded, layers, of, symbolism, allusion, and, paradox, in, his, art, to, the, lasting, fascination, of, scholars, in, the, view, of, art, historian, ellis, waterhouse, his, portraiture, remains, unsurpassed, for, sureness, and, economy, of, statement, penetration, into, character, and, a, combined, richness, and, purity, of, style, holbein, was,

the, margin, of, a, copy, of, the, praise, of, folly, by, the, humanist, scholar, desiderius, erasmus, of, rotterdam, the, sketches, provide, early, evidence, of, holbein, s, wit, and, humanistic, leaning, his, other, early, works, including, the, double, portrait, of, basel, s, mayor, jakob, meyer, zum, hasen, and, his, wife, dorothea, follow, his, father, s, style, with, meyer, zum, hasen, holbein, maintained, a, close, working, relationship, until, the, latter, was, sacked, in, 1521, the, young, holbein, alongside, his, brother, and, his, father, is, pictured, in, the, left, hand,

records, show, that, on, 10, december, 1517, he, was, fined, five, livres, for, fighting, in, the, street, with, a, goldsmith, called, caspar, who, was, fined, the, same, amount, that, winter, holbein, probably, visited, northern, italy, though, no, record, of, the, trip, survives, many, scholars, believe, he, studied, the, work, of, italian, masters, of, fresco, such, as, andrea, mantegna, before, returning, to, lucerne, he, filled, two, series, of, panels, at, hertenstein, s, house, with, copies, of, works, by, andrea, mantegna, including, the, triumphs, of, caesar, in, 1519, holbein, moved, back, to, basel, his, brother, fades, from, the, record, at, about, this, time, and, it, is, usually, presumed, that, he, died, holbein, re, established, himself, rapidly, in, the, city,

katharina, in, 1526, and, two, more, children, jacob, and, k, ngold, in, later, years, holbein, was, prolific, during, this, period, in, basel, which, coincided, with, the, arrival, of, lutheranism, in, the, city, he, undertook, a, number, of, major, projects, such, as, external, murals, for, the, house, of, the, dance, and, internal, murals, for, the, council, chamber, of, the, town, hall, the, former, are, known, from, preparatory, drawings, the, council, chamber, murals, survive, in, a, few, poorly, preserved, fragments, holbein, also, produced, a, series, of, religious, paintings, and, designed, cartoons, for, stained, glass, windows, in, a, period, of, a, revolution, in, book, design, he, illustrated, for, the, publisher, johann, froben, his, woodcut, designs, included, those, for, the, dance, of, death, cut, by, the, formschneider, hans, l, tzelburger, the, icones, illustrations, of, the, old, testament, and, the, title, page, of, martin, luther, s, bible, additionally, he, designed, twelve, alphabets, of, those, a, greek, and, latin, for, froben, the, letters, were, ornamented, with, depictions, of, greek, and, roman, gods, heads, of, caesars, poets, and, philosophers, through, the, woodcut, medium, holbein, refined, his, grasp, of, expressive, and, spatial, effects, holbein, also, painted, the, occasional, portrait, in, basel, among, them, the, double, portrait, of, jakob, and, dorothea, meyer, and, in, 1519, that, of, the, young, academic, bonifacius, amerbach, according, to, art, historian, paul, ganz, the, portrait, of, amerbach, marks, an, advance, in, his, style, notably, in, the, use, of, unbroken, colours, for, meyer, he, painted, an, altarpiece, of, the, madonna, which, included, portraits, of, the, donor, his, wife, and, his, daughter, in, 1523, holbein, painted, his, first, portraits, of, the, great, renaissance, scholar, erasmus, who, required, likenesses, to, send, to, his, friends, and, admirers, throughout, europe, these, paintings, made, holbein, an, international, artist, holbein, visited, france, in, 1524, probably, to, seek, work, at, the, court, of, francis, i, when, holbein, decided, to, seek, employment, in, england, in, 1526, erasmus, recommended, him, to, his, friend, the, statesman, and, scholar, thomas, more, the, arts, are, freezing, in, this, part, of, the, world, he, wrote, and, he, is, on, the, way, to, england, to, pick, up, some, angels, holbein, broke, his, journey, towards, antwerp, where, he, delivered, a, recommendation, from, erasmus, to, pieter, gillis, in, antwerp, he, also, bought, some, oak, panels, and, may, have, met, the, painter, quentin, matsys, gillis, then, seemed, to, have, sent, holbein, to, the, court, of, england, where, sir, thomas, more, welcomed, him, to, and, found, him, a, series, of, commissions, your, painter, my, dearest, erasmus, he, wrote, is, a, wonderful, artist, holbein, painted, the, famous, portrait, of, sir, thomas, more, and, another, of, more, with, his, family, the, group, portrait, original, in, conception, is, known, only, from, a, preparatory, sketch, and, copies, by, other, hands, according, to, art, historian, andreas, beyer, it, offered, a, prelude, of, a, genre, that, would, only, truly, gain, acceptance, in, dutch, painting, of, the, seventeenth, century, seven, fine, related, studies, of, more, family, members, also, survive, during, this, first, stay, in, england, holbein, worked, largely, for, a, humanist, circle, with, ties, to, erasmus, among, his, commissions, was, the, portrait, of, william, warham, archbishop, of, canterbury, who, owned, a, holbein, portrait, of, erasmus, holbein, also, painted, the, bavarian, astronomer, and, mathematician, nicholas, kratzer, a, tutor, of, the, more, family, whose, notes, appear, on, holbein, s, sketch, for, their, group, portrait, although, holbein, did, not, work, for, the, king, during, this, visit, he, painted, the, portraits, of, courtiers, such, as, sir, henry, guildford, and, his, wife, lady, mary, and, of, anne, lovell, identified, in, 2003, or, 2004, as, the, subject, of, lady, with, a, squirrel, and, a, starling, in, may, 1527, master, hans, also, painted, a, panorama, of, the, siege, of, th, rouanne, for, the, visit, of, french, ambassadors, with, kratzer, he, devised, a, ceiling, covered, in, planetary, signs, under, which, the, visitors, dined, the, chronicler, edward, hall, described, the, spectacle, as, showing, the, whole, earth, environed, with, the, sea, like, a, very, map, or, cart, in, august, 1528, holbein, bought, a, house, in, basel, in, st, johanns, vorstadt, and, became, the, neighbor, of, hieronymus, froben, for, this, house, he, paid, a, third, in, advance, he, presumably, returned, home, to, preserve, his, citizenship, since, he, had, been, granted, only, a, two, year, leave, of, absence, enriched, by, his, success, in, england, holbein, bought, a, second, neighboring, house, in, 1531, for, which, he, initially, advanced, only, a, seventh, of, the, price, and, was, to, pay, a, yearly, rate, during, the, following, six, years, during, this, period, in, basel, he, painted, the, artist, s, family, showing, elsbeth, with, the, couple, s, two, eldest, children, philipp, and, katherina, evoking, images, of, the, virgin, and, child, with, st, john, the, baptist, art, historian, john, rowlands, sees, this, work, as, one, of, the, most, moving, portraits, in, art, from, an, artist, too, who, always, characterized, his, sitters, with, a, guarded, restraint, basel, had, become, a, turbulent, city, in, holbein, s, absence, reformers, swayed, by, the, ideas, of, zwingli, carried, out, acts, of, iconoclasm, and, banned, imagery, in, churches, in, april, 1529, the, free, thinking, erasmus, felt, obliged, to, leave, his, former, haven, for, freiburg, im, breisgau, the, iconoclasts, probably, destroyed, some, of, holbein, s, religious, artwork, though, the, paintings, on, the, organ, doors, of, the, basel, minster, were, saved, evidence, for, holbein, s, religious, views, is, fragmentary, and, inconclusive, the, religious, side, of, his, paintings, had, always, been, ambiguous, suggests, art, historian, john, north, and, so, it, remained, according, to, a, register, compiled, to, ensure, that, all, major, citizens, subscribed, to, the, new, doctrines, master, hans, holbein, the, painter, says, that, we, must, be, better, informed, about, the, table, before, approaching, it, in, 1530, the, authorities, called, holbein, to, account, for, failing, to, attend, the, reformed, communion, shortly, afterwards, however, he, was, listed, among, those, who, have, no, serious, objections, and, wish, to, go, along, with, other, christians, holbein, evidently, retained, favour, under, the, new, order, the, reformist, council, paid, him, a, retaining, fee, of, 50, florins, and, commissioned, him, to, resume, work, on, the, council, chamber, frescoes, they, now, chose, themes, from, the, old, testament, instead, of, the, previous, stories, from, classical, history, and, allegory, holbein, s, frescoes, of, rehoboam, and, of, the, meeting, between, saul, and, samuel, were, more, simply, designed, than, their, predecessors, holbein, worked, for, traditional, clients, at, the, same, time, his, old, patron, jakob, meyer, paid, him, to, add, figures, and, details, to, the, family, altarpiece, he, had, painted, in, 1526, holbein, s, last, commission, in, this, period, was, the, decoration, of, two, clock, faces, on, the, city, gate, in, 1531, the, reduced, levels, of, patronage, in, basel, may, have, prompted, his, decision, to, return, to, england, early, in, 1532, holbein, returned, to, england, where, the, political, and, religious, environment, was, changing, radically, in, 1532, henry, viii, was, preparing, to, repudiate, catherine, of, aragon, and, marry, anne, boleyn, in, defiance, of, the, pope, among, those, who, opposed, henry, s, actions, was, holbein, s, former, host, and, patron, sir, thomas, more, who, resigned, as, lord, chancellor, in, may, 1532, around, this, time, holbein, is, supposed, to, have, decorated, the, mortuary, roll, of, john, islip, abbot, of, westminster, one, of, the, last, mortuary, rolls, created, holbein, seems, to, have, distanced, himself, from, more, s, humanist, milieu, on, this, visit, and, he, deceived, those, to, whom, he, was, recommended, according, to, erasmus, the, artist, found, favour, instead, within, the, radical, new, power, circles, of, the, boleyn, family, and, thomas, cromwell, cromwell, became, the, king, s, secretary, in, 1534, controlling, all, aspects, of, government, including, artistic, propaganda, more, was, executed, in, 1535, along, with, john, fisher, whose, portrait, holbein, had, also, drawn, holbein, s, commissions, in, the, early, stages, of, his, second, english, period, included, portraits, of, lutheran, merchants, of, the, hanseatic, league, the, merchants, lived, and, plied, their, trade, at, the, steelyard, a, complex, of, warehouses, offices, and, dwellings, on, the, north, bank, of, the, thames, holbein, rented, a, house, in, maiden, lane, nearby, and, he, portrayed, his, clients, in, a, range, of, styles, his, portrait, of, georg, giese, of, gda, sk, shows, the, merchant, surrounded, by, exquisitely, painted, symbols, of, his, trade, his, portrait, of, derich, berck, of, cologne, on, the, other, hand, is, classically, simple, and, possibly, influenced, by, titian, for, the, guildhall, of, the, steelyard, holbein, painted, the, monumental, allegories, the, triumph, of, wealth, and, the, triumph, of, poverty, both, now, lost, the, merchants, also, commissioned, a, street, tableau, of, mount, parnassus, for, anne, boleyn, s, coronation, eve, procession, of, 31, may, 1533, holbein, also, portrayed, various, courtiers, landowners, and, visitors, during, this, time, and, his, most, famous, painting, of, the, period, was, the, ambassadors, this, life, sized, panel, portrays, jean, de, dinteville, an, ambassador, of, francis, i, of, france, in, 1533, and, georges, de, selve, bishop, of, lavaur, who, visited, london, the, same, year, the, work, incorporates, symbols, and, paradoxes, including, an, anamorphic, distorted, skull, according, to, scholars, these, are, enigmatic, references, to, learning, religion, mortality, and, illusion, in, the, tradition, of, the, northern, renaissance, art, historians, oskar, b, tschmann, and, pascal, griener, suggest, that, in, the, ambassadors, sciences, and, arts, objects, of, luxury, and, glory, are, measured, against, the, grandeur, of, death, no, certain, painted, portraits, survive, of, anne, boleyn, by, holbein, perhaps, because, her, memory, was, purged, following, her, execution, for, treason, incest, and, adultery, in, 1536, although, there, is, a, drawing, as, made, from, life, by, holbein, preparatory, to, painting, a, portrait, it, is, clear, however, that, holbein, worked, directly, for, anne, and, her, circle, he, designed, a, cup, engraved, with, her, device, of, a, falcon, standing, on, roses, as, well, as, jewellery, and, books, connected, to, her, he, also, sketched, several, women, attached, to, her, entourage, including, her, sister, in, law, jane, parker, at, the, same, time, holbein, worked, for, thomas, cromwell, as, he, masterminded, henry, viii, s, reformation, cromwell, commissioned, holbein, to, produce, reformist, and, royalist, images, including, anti, clerical, woodcuts, and, the, title, page, to, myles, coverdale, s, english, translation, of, the, bible, henry, viii, had, embarked, on, a, grandiose, programme, of, artistic, patronage, his, efforts, to, glorify, his, new, status, as, supreme, head, of, the, church, culminated, in, the, building, of, nonsuch, palace, which, started, in, 1538, by, 1536, holbein, was, employed, as, the, king, s, painter, on, an, annual, salary, of, 30, pounds, though, he, was, never, the, highest, paid, artist, on, the, royal, payroll, royal, pictor, maker, lucas, horenbout, earned, more, and, other, continental, artists, also, worked, for, the, king, in, 1537, holbein, painted, his, most, famous, image, henry, viii, standing, in, a, heroic, pose, with, his, feet, planted, apart, the, left, section, has, survived, of, holbein, s, cartoon, for, a, life, sized, wall, painting, at, whitehall, palace, showing, the, king, in, this, pose, with, his, father, behind, him, the, mural, also, depicted, jane, seymour, and, elizabeth, of, york, it, was, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1698, but, is, known, from, engravings, and, from, a, 1667, copy, by, remigius, van, leemput, an, earlier, half, length, portrait, shows, henry, in, a, similar, pose, but, all, the, full, length, portraits, of, him, are, copies, based, on, the, whitehall, pattern, the, figure, of, jane, seymour, in, the, mural, is, related, to, holbein, s, sketch, and, painting, of, her, jane, died, in, october, 1537, shortly, after, bearing, henry, s, only, legitimate, son, edward, vi, holbein, painted, a, portrait, of, the, infant, prince, about, two, years, later, clutching, a, sceptre, like, gold, rattle, holbein, s, final, portrait, of, henry, dates, from, 1543, and, was, perhaps, completed, by, others, depicting, the, king, with, a, group, of, barber, surgeons, holbein, s, portrait, style, altered, after, he, entered, henry, s, service, he, focused, more, intensely, on, the, sitter, s, face, and, clothing, largely, omitting, props, and, three, dimensional, settings, he, applied, this, clean, craftsman, like, technique, to, miniature, portraits, such, as, that, of, jane, small, and, to, grand, portraits, such, as, that, of, christina, of, denmark, he, travelled, with, philip, hoby, to, brussels, in, 1538, and, sketched, christina, for, the, king, who, was, appraising, the, young, widow, as, a, prospective, bride, john, hutton, the, english, ambassador, in, brussels, reported, that, another, artist, s, drawing, of, christina, was, sloberid, slobbered, compared, to, holbein, s, in, wilson, s, view, holbein, s, subsequent, oil, portrait, is, the, loveliest, painting, of, a, woman, that, he, ever, executed, which, is, to, say, that, it, is, one, of, the, finest, female, portraits, ever, painted, the, same, year, holbein, and, hoby, went, to, france, to, paint, louise, of, guise, and, anna, of, lorraine, for, henry, viii, neither, portrait, of, these, cousins, has, survived, holbein, found, time, to, visit, basel, where, he, was, f, ted, by, the, authorities, and, granted, a, pension, on, the, way, back, to, england, he, apprenticed, his, son, philipp, to, basel, born, goldsmith, jacob, david, in, paris, holbein, painted, anne, of, cleves, at, burgau, castle, posing, her, square, on, and, in, elaborate, finery, this, was, the, woman, whom, henry, married, at, d, ren, at, the, encouragement, of, thomas, cromwell, in, the, summer, of, 1539, english, envoy, nicholas, wotton, reported, that, hans, holbein, hath, taken, the, effigies, of, my, lady, anne, and, the, lady, amelia, and, hath, expressed, their, images, very, lively, henry, was, disillusioned, with, anne, in, the, flesh, however, and, he, divorced, her, after, a, brief, unconsummated, marriage, there, is, a, tradition, that, holbein, s, portrait, flattered, anne, derived, from, the, testimony, of, sir, anthony, browne, henry, said, that, he, was, dismayed, by, her, appearance, at, rochester, having, seen, her, pictures, and, heard, advertisements, of, her, beauty, so, much, that, his, face, fell, no, one, other, than, henry, ever, described, anne, as, repugnant, french, ambassador, charles, de, marillac, thought, her, quite, attractive, pleasant, and, dignified, though, dressed, in, unflattering, heavy, german, clothing, as, were, her, attendants, some, of, the, blame, for, the, king, s, disillusionment, fell, on, thomas, cromwell, who, had, been, instrumental, in, arranging, the, marriage, and, had, passed, on, some, exaggerated, claims, of, anne, s, beauty, this, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, cromwell, s, downfall, holbein, had, deftly, survived, the, downfall, of, his, first, two, great, patrons, thomas, more, and, anne, boleyn, but, cromwell, s, sudden, arrest, and, execution, on, trumped, up, charges, of, heresy, and, treason, in, 1540, undoubtedly, damaged, his, career, though, holbein, retained, his, position, as, king, s, painter, cromwell, s, death, left, a, gap, no, other, patron, could, fill, it, was, ironically, holbein, s, portrait, of, anne, of, cleves, which, largely, led, to, cromwell, s, downfall, furious, at, being, saddled, with, a, wife, he, found, entirely, unattractive, the, king, directed, all, his, anger, at, cromwell, granted, cromwell, had, exaggerated, her, beauty, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, henry, blamed, holbein, for, supposedly, flattering, anne, s, looks, apart, from, routine, official, duties, holbein, now, occupied, himself, with, private, commissions, turning, again, to, portraits, of, steelyard, merchants, he, also, painted, some, of, his, finest, miniatures, including, those, of, henry, brandon, and, charles, brandon, sons, of, henry, viii, s, friend, charles, brandon, 1st, duke, of, suffolk, and, his, fourth, wife, catherine, willoughby, holbein, managed, to, secure, commissions, among, those, courtiers, who, now, jockeyed, for, power, in, particular, from, anthony, denny, one, of, the, two, chief, gentlemen, of, the, bedchamber, he, became, close, enough, to, denny, to, borrow, money, from, him, he, painted, denny, s, portrait, in, 1541, and, two, years, later, designed, a, clock, salt, for, him, denny, was, part, of, a, circle, that, gained, influence, in, 1542, after, the, failure, of, henry, s, marriage, to, catherine, howard, the, king, s, marriage, in, july, 1543, to, the, reformist, catherine, parr, whose, brother, holbein, had, painted, in, 1541, established, denny, s, party, in, power, holbein, may, have, visited, his, wife, and, children, in, late, 1540, when, his, leave, of, absence, from, basel, expired, none, of, his, work, dates, from, this, period, and, the, basel, authorities, paid, him, six, months, salary, in, advance, the, state, of, holbein, s, marriage, has, intrigued, scholars, who, base, their, speculations, on, fragmentary, evidence, apart, from, one, brief, visit, holbein, had, lived, apart, from, elsbeth, since, 1532, his, will, reveals, that, he, had, two, infant, children, in, england, of, whom, nothing, is, known, except, that, they, were, in, the, care, of, a, nurse, holbein, s, unfaithfulness, to, elsbeth, may, not, have, been, new, some, scholars, believe, that, magdalena, offenburg, the, model, for, the, darmstadt, madonna, and, for, two, portraits, painted, in, basel, was, for, a, time, holbein, s, mistress, others, dismiss, the, idea, one, of, the, portraits, was, of, lais, of, corinth, mistress, of, apelles, the, famous, artist, of, greek, antiquity, after, whom, holbein, was, named, in, humanist, circles, whatever, the, case, it, is, likely, that, holbein, always, supported, his, wife, and, children, when, elsbeth, died, in, 1549, she, was, well, off, and, still, owned, many, of, holbein, s, fine, clothes, on, the, other, hand, she, had, sold, his, portrait, of, her, before, his, death, hans, holbein, died, between, 7, october, and, 29, november, 1543, at, the, age, of, 45, karel, van, mander, stated, in, the, early, 17th, century, that, he, died, of, the, plague, wilson, regards, the, story, with, caution, since, holbein, s, friends, attended, his, bedside, and, peter, claussen, suggests, that, he, died, of, an, infection, describing, himself, as, servant, to, the, king, s, majesty, holbein, made, his, will, on, 7, october, at, his, home, in, aldgate, the, goldsmith, john, of, antwerp, and, a, few, german, neighbours, signed, as, witnesses, holbein, may, have, been, in, a, hurry, because, the, will, was, not, witnessed, by, a, lawyer, on, 29, november, john, of, antwerp, the, subject, of, several, of, holbein, s, portraits, legally, undertook, the, administration, of, the, artist, s, last, wishes, he, presumably, settled, holbein, s, debts, arranged, for, the, care, of, his, two, children, and, sold, and, dispersed, his, effects, including, many, designs, and, preliminary, drawings, that, have, survived, the, site, of, holbein, s, grave, is, unknown, and, may, never, have, been, marked, the, churches, of, st, katherine, cree, or, st, andrew, undershaft, in, london, are, possible, locations, being, located, near, his, house, the, first, influence, on, holbein, was, his, father, hans, holbein, the, elder, an, accomplished, religious, artist, and, portraitist, who, passed, on, his, techniques, as, a, religious, artist, and, his, gifts, as, a, portraitist, to, his, son, the, young, holbein, learned, his, craft, in, his, father, s, workshop, in, augsburg, a, city, with, a, thriving, book, trade, where, woodcut, and, engraving, flourished, augsburg, also, acted, as, one, of, the, chief, ports, of, entry, into, germany, for, the, ideas, of, the, italian, renaissance, by, the, time, holbein, began, his, apprenticeship, under, hans, herbster, in, basel, he, was, already, steeped, in, the, late, gothic, style, with, its, unsparing, realism, and, emphasis, on, line, which, influenced, him, throughout, his, life, in, basel, he, was, favoured, by, humanist, patrons, whose, ideas, helped, form, his, vision, as, a, mature, artist, during, his, swiss, years, when, he, may, have, visited, italy, holbein, added, an, italian, element, to, his, stylistic, vocabulary, scholars, note, the, influence, of, leonardo, da, vinci, s, sfumato, smoky, technique, on, his, work, for, example, in, his, lais, of, corinth, from, the, italians, holbein, learned, the, art, of, single, point, perspective, and, the, use, of, antique, motifs, and, architectural, forms, in, this, he, may, have, been, influenced, by, andrea, mantegna, the, decorative, detail, recedes, in, his, late, portraits, though, the, calculated, precision, remains, despite, assimilating, italian, techniques, and, reformation, theology, holbein, s, art, in, many, ways, extended, the, gothic, tradition, his, portrait, style, for, example, remained, distinct, from, the, more, sensuous, technique, of, titian, and, from, the, mannerism, of, william, scrots, holbein, s, successor, as, king, s, painter, holbein, s, portraiture, particularly, his, drawings, had, more, in, common, with, that, of, jean, clouet, which, he, may, have, seen, during, his, visit, to, france, in, 1524, he, adopted, clouet, s, method, of, drawing, with, coloured, chalks, on, a, plain, ground, as, well, as, his, care, over, preliminary, portraits, for, their, own, sake, during, his, second, stay, in, england, holbein, learned, the, technique, of, limning, as, practised, by, lucas, horenbout, in, his, last, years, he, raised, the, art, of, the, portrait, miniature, to, its, first, peak, of, brilliance, holbein, followed, in, the, footsteps, of, augsburg, artists, like, his, father, and, hans, burgkmair, who, largely, made, their, living, from, religious, commissions, despite, calls, for, reform, the, church, in, the, late, 15th, century, was, medieval, in, tradition, it, maintained, an, allegiance, to, rome, and, a, faith, in, pieties, such, as, pilgrimages, veneration, of, relics, and, prayer, for, dead, souls, holbein, s, early, work, reflects, this, culture, the, growing, reform, movement, led, by, humanists, such, as, erasmus, and, thomas, more, began, however, to, change, religious, attitudes, basel, where, martin, luther, s, major, works, were, first, published, became, the, main, centre, for, the, transmission, of, reformation, ideas, the, gradual, shift, from, traditional, to, reformed, religion, can, be, charted, in, holbein, s, work, his, body, of, the, dead, christ, in, the, tomb, of, 1522, expresses, a, humanist, view, of, christ, in, tune, with, the, reformist, climate, in, basel, at, the, time, the, dance, of, death, 1523, 26, refashions, the, late, medieval, allegory, of, the, danse, macabre, as, a, reformist, satire, holbein, s, series, of, woodcuts, shows, the, figure, of, death, in, many, disguises, confronting, individuals, from, all, walks, of, life, none, escape, death, s, skeleton, clutches, even, the, pious, in, addition, to, the, dance, of, death, holbein, completed, icones, or, series, of, the, old, gospel, it, contains, two, works, the, images, of, the, stories, of, the, old, gospel, and, portraits, or, printing, boards, of, the, story, of, the, old, gospel, these, works, were, arranged, by, holbein, with, melchior, gaspar, trechsel, in, about, 1526, later, printed, and, edited, in, latin, by, jean, francois, frellon, with, 92, woodcuts, these, two, works, also, share, the, first, four, figures, with, the, dance, of, death, it, appears, that, the, trechsel, brothers, initially, intended, to, hire, holbein, for, illustrating, bibles, in, fact, some, of, holbein, s, icones, woodcuts, appear, in, the, recently, discovered, biblia, cum, glossis, by, michel, de, villeneuve, michael, servetus, holbein, woodcuts, appear, in, several, other, works, by, servetus, his, spanish, translation, of, the, images, of, the, stories, of, the, old, gospel, printed, by, juan, stelsio, in, antwerp, in, 1540, 92, woodcuts, and, also, of, his, spanish, versification, of, the, associated, work, portraits, or, printing, boards, of, the, story, of, the, old, gospel, printed, by, francois, and, jean, frellon, in, 1542, same, 92, woodcuts, plus, 2, more, as, it, was, demonstrated, in, the, international, society, for, the, history, of, medicine, by, the, expert, researcher, in, servetus, gonz, lez, echeverr, a, who, also, proved, the, existence, of, the, other, work, of, holbein, de, villeneuve, biblia, cum, glossis, or, lost, bible, holbein, painted, many, large, religious, works, between, 1520, and, 1526, including, the, oberried, altarpiece, the, solothurn, madonna, and, the, passion, only, when, basel, s, reformers, turned, to, iconoclasm, in, the, later, 1520s, did, his, freedom, and, income, as, a, religious, artist, suffer, holbein, continued, to, produce, religious, art, but, on, a, much, smaller, scale, he, designed, satirical, religious, woodcuts, in, england, his, small, painting, for, private, devotion, noli, me, tangere, has, been, taken, as, an, expression, of, his, personal, religion, depicting, the, moment, when, the, risen, christ, tells, mary, magdalene, not, to, touch, him, holbein, adheres, to, the, details, of, the, bible, story, the, 17th, century, diarist, john, evelyn, wrote, that, he, never, saw, so, much, reverence, and, kind, of, heavenly, astonishment, expressed, in, a, picture, holbein, has, been, described, as, the, supreme, representative, of, german, reformation, art, the, reformation, was, a, varied, movement, however, and, his, position, was, often, ambiguous, despite, his, ties, with, erasmus, and, more, he, signed, up, to, the, revolution, begun, by, martin, luther, which, called, for, a, return, to, the, bible, and, the, overthrow, of, the, papacy, in, his, woodcuts, christ, as, the, light, of, the, world, and, the, selling, of, indulgences, holbein, illustrated, attacks, by, luther, against, rome, at, the, same, time, he, continued, to, work, for, erasmians, and, known, traditionalists, after, his, return, from, england, to, a, reformed, basel, in, 1528, he, resumed, work, both, on, jakob, meyer, s, madonna, and, on, the, murals, for, the, council, chamber, of, the, town, hall, the, madonna, was, an, icon, of, traditional, piety, while, the, old, testament, murals, illustrated, a, reformist, agenda, holbein, returned, to, england, in, 1532, as, thomas, cromwell, was, about, to, transform, religious, institutions, there, he, was, soon, at, work, for, cromwell, s, propaganda, machine, creating, images, in, support, of, the, royal, supremacy, during, the, period, of, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, he, produced, a, series, of, small, woodcuts, in, which, biblical, villains, were, dressed, as, monks, his, reformist, painting, the, old, and, the, new, law, archived, 25, january, 2018, at, the, wayback, machine, identified, the, old, testament, with, the, old, religion, scholars, have, detected, subtler, religious, references, in, his, portraits, in, the, ambassadors, for, example, details, such, as, the, lutheran, hymn, book, and, the, crucifix, behind, the, curtain, allude, to, the, context, of, the, french, mission, holbein, painted, few, religious, images, in, the, later, part, of, his, career, he, focused, on, secular, designs, for, decorative, objects, and, on, portraits, stripped, of, inessentials, for, holbein, everything, began, with, a, drawing, a, gifted, draughtsman, he, was, heir, to, a, german, tradition, of, line, drawing, and, precise, preparatory, design, holbein, s, chalk, and, ink, portraits, demonstrate, his, mastery, of, outline, he, always, made, preparatory, portraits, of, his, sitters, though, many, drawings, survive, for, which, no, painted, version, is, known, suggesting, that, some, were, drawn, for, their, own, sake, holbein, produced, relatively, few, portraits, during, his, years, in, basel, among, these, were, his, 1516, studies, of, jakob, and, dorothea, meyer, sketched, like, many, of, his, father, s, portrait, drawings, in, silverpoint, and, chalk, holbein, painted, most, of, his, portraits, during, his, two, periods, in, england, in, the, first, between, 1526, and, 1528, he, used, the, technique, of, jean, clouet, for, his, preliminary, studies, combining, black, and, coloured, chalks, on, unprimed, paper, in, the, second, from, 1532, to, his, death, he, drew, on, smaller, sheets, of, pink, primed, paper, adding, pen, and, brushwork, in, ink, to, the, chalk, judging, by, the, three, hour, sitting, given, to, him, by, christina, of, denmark, holbein, could, produce, such, portrait, studies, quickly, some, scholars, believe, that, he, used, a, mechanical, device, to, help, him, trace, the, contours, of, his, subjects, faces, holbein, paid, less, attention, to, facial, tones, in, his, later, drawings, making, fewer, and, more, emphatic, strokes, but, they, are, never, formulaic, his, grasp, of, spatial, relationships, ensures, that, each, portrait, however, sparely, drawn, conveys, the, sitter, s, presence, holbein, s, painted, portraits, were, closely, founded, on, drawing, holbein, transferred, each, drawn, portrait, study, to, the, panel, with, the, aid, of, geometrical, instruments, he, then, built, up, the, painted, surface, in, tempera, and, oil, recording, the, tiniest, detail, down, to, each, stitch, or, fastening, of, costume, in, the, view, of, art, historian, paul, ganz, the, deep, glaze, and, the, enamel, like, lustre, of, the, colouring, were, achieved, by, means, of, the, metallic, highly, polished, crayon, groundwork, which, admitted, of, few, corrections, and, like, the, preliminary, sketch, remained, visible, through, the, thin, layer, of, colour, the, result, is, a, brilliant, portrait, style, in, which, the, sitters, appear, in, foister, s, words, as, recognisably, individual, and, even, contemporary, seeming, people, dressed, in, minutely, rendered, clothing, that, provides, an, unsurpassed, source, for, the, history, of, tudor, costume, holbein, s, humanist, clients, valued, individuality, highly, according, to, strong, his, portrait, subjects, underwent, a, new, experience, one, which, was, a, profound, visual, expression, of, humanist, ideals, commentators, differ, in, their, response, to, holbein, s, precision, and, objectivity, as, a, portraitist, what, some, see, as, an, expression, of, spiritual, depth, in, his, sitters, others, have, called, mournful, aloof, or, even, vacant, perhaps, an, underlying, coolness, suffuses, their, countenances, wrote, holbein, s, 19th, century, biographer, alfred, woltmann, but, behind, this, outward, placidness, lies, hidden, a, breadth, and, depth, of, inner, life, some, critics, see, the, iconic, and, pared, down, style, of, holbein, s, later, portraits, as, a, regression, kenyon, cox, for, example, believes, that, his, methods, grew, more, primitive, reducing, painting, almost, to, the, condition, of, medieval, illumination, erna, auerbach, relates, the, decorative, formal, flatness, of, holbein, s, late, art, to, the, style, of, illuminated, documents, citing, the, group, portrait, of, henry, viii, and, the, barber, surgeons, company, other, analysts, detect, no, loss, of, powers, in, holbein, s, last, phase, until, the, later, 1530s, holbein, often, placed, his, sitters, in, a, three, dimensional, setting, at, times, he, included, classical, and, biblical, references, and, inscriptions, as, well, as, drapery, architecture, and, symbolic, props, such, portraits, allowed, holbein, to, demonstrate, his, virtuosity, and, powers, of, allusion, and, metaphor, as, well, as, to, hint, at, the, private, world, of, his, subjects, his, 1532, portrait, of, sir, brian, tuke, for, example, alludes, to, the, sitter, s, poor, health, comparing, his, sufferings, to, those, of, job, the, depiction, of, the, five, wounds, of, christ, and, the, inscription, inri, on, tuke, s, crucifix, are, according, to, scholars, b, tschmann, and, griener, intended, to, protect, its, owner, against, ill, health, holbein, portrays, the, merchant, georg, gisze, among, elaborate, symbols, of, science, and, wealth, that, evoke, the, sitter, s, personal, iconography, however, some, of, holbein, s, other, portraits, of, steelyard, merchants, for, example, that, of, derich, born, concentrate, on, the, naturalness, of, the, face, they, prefigure, the, simpler, style, that, holbein, favoured, in, the, later, part, of, his, career, study, of, holbein, s, later, portraits, has, been, complicated, by, the, number, of, copies, and, derivative, works, attributed, to, him, scholars, now, seek, to, distinguish, the, true, holbeins, by, the, refinement, and, quality, of, the, work, the, hallmark, of, holbein, s, art, is, a, searching, and, perfectionist, approach, discernible, in, his, alterations, to, his, portraits, in, the, words, of, art, historian, john, rowlands, this, striving, for, perfection, is, very, evident, in, his, portrait, drawings, where, he, searches, with, his, brush, for, just, the, right, line, for, the, sitter, s, profile, the, critical, faculty, in, making, this, choice, and, his, perception, of, its, potency, in, communicating, decisively, the, sitter, s, character, is, a, true, measure, of, holbein, s, supreme, greatness, as, a, portrait, painter, nobody, has, ever, surpassed, the, revealing, profile, and, stance, in, his, portraits, through, their, telling, use, holbein, still, conveys, across, the, centuries, the, character, and, likeness, of, his, sitters, with, unrivalled, mastery, during, his, last, decade, holbein, painted, a, number, of, miniatures, which, are, small, portraits, worn, as, a, kind, of, jewel, his, miniature, technique, derived, from, the, medieval, art, of, manuscript, illumination, his, small, panel, portrait, of, henry, viii, shows, an, interpenetration, between, his, panel, and, miniature, painting, holbein, s, large, pictures, had, always, contained, a, miniature, like, precision, he, now, adapted, this, skill, to, the, smaller, form, somehow, retaining, a, monumental, effect, the, twelve, or, so, certain, miniatures, by, holbein, that, survive, reveal, his, mastery, of, limning, as, the, technique, was, called, his, miniature, portrait, of, jane, small, with, its, rich, blue, background, crisp, outlines, and, absence, of, shading, is, considered, a, masterpiece, of, the, genre, according, to, art, historian, graham, reynolds, holbein, portrays, a, young, woman, whose, plainness, is, scarcely, relieved, by, her, simple, costume, of, black, and, white, materials, and, yet, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, this, is, one, of, the, great, portraits, of, the, world, with, remarkable, objectivity, holbein, has, not, added, anything, of, himself, or, subtracted, from, his, sitter, s, image, he, has, seen, her, as, she, appeared, in, a, solemn, mood, in, the, cold, light, of, his, painting, room, throughout, his, life, holbein, designed, both, large, scale, decorative, works, such, as, murals, and, smaller, objects, including, plate, and, jewellery, in, many, cases, his, designs, or, copies, of, them, are, the, sole, evidence, for, such, works, for, example, his, murals, for, the, hertenstein, house, in, lucerne, and, for, the, house, of, the, dance, in, basel, are, known, only, through, his, designs, as, his, career, progressed, he, added, italian, renaissance, motifs, to, his, gothic, vocabulary, many, of, the, intricate, designs, etched, into, suits, of, greenwich, armour, including, king, henry, s, own, personal, tournament, harnesses, were, based, on, designs, by, holbein, his, style, continued, to, influence, the, unique, form, of, english, armour, for, nearly, half, a, century, after, his, death, holbein, s, cartoon, for, part, of, the, dynastic, tudor, wall, painting, at, whitehall, reveals, how, he, prepared, for, a, large, mural, it, was, made, of, 25, pieces, of, paper, each, figure, cut, out, and, pasted, onto, the, background, many, of, holbein, s, designs, for, glass, painting, metalwork, jewellery, and, weapons, also, survive, all, demonstrate, the, precision, and, fluidity, of, his, draughtsmanship, in, the, view, of, art, historian, susan, foister, these, qualities, so, animate, his, decorative, designs, whether, individual, motifs, such, as, his, favoured, serpentine, mermen, and, women, or, the, larger, shapes, of, cups, frames, and, fountains, that, they, scintillate, on, paper, even, before, their, transformation, into, precious, metal, and, stone, holbein, s, way, of, designing, objects, was, to, sketch, preliminary, ideas, and, then, draw, successive, versions, with, increasing, precision, his, final, draft, was, a, presentation, version, he, often, used, traditional, patterns, for, ornamental, details, such, as, foliage, and, branches, when, designing, precious, objects, holbein, worked, closely, with, craftsmen, such, as, goldsmiths, including, cornelis, hayes, his, design, work, suggests, art, historian, john, north, gave, him, an, unparalleled, feel, for, the, textures, of, materials, of, all, kinds, and, it, also, gave, him, the, habit, of, relating, physical, accessories, to, face, and, personality, in, his, portraiture, although, little, is, known, of, holbein, s, workshop, scholars, assume, that, his, drawings, were, partly, intended, as, sources, for, his, assistants, holbein, s, fame, owes, something, to, that, of, his, sitters, several, of, his, portraits, have, become, cultural, icons, he, created, the, standard, image, of, henry, viii, in, painting, henry, as, an, iconic, hero, however, he, also, subtly, conveyed, the, tyranny, of, his, character, holbein, s, portraits, of, other, historical, figures, such, as, erasmus, thomas, more, and, thomas, cromwell, have, fixed, their, images, for, posterity, the, same, is, true, for, the, array, of, english, lords, and, ladies, whose, appearance, is, often, known, only, through, his, art, for, this, reason, john, north, calls, holbein, the, cameraman, of, tudor, history, in, germany, on, the, other, hand, holbein, is, regarded, as, an, artist, of, the, reformation, and, in, europe, of, humanism, in, basel, holbein, s, legacy, was, secured, by, his, friend, amerbach, and, by, amerbach, s, son, basilius, who, collected, his, work, the, amerbach, kabinett, later, formed, the, core, of, the, holbein, collection, at, the, kunstmuseum, basel, although, holbein, s, art, was, also, valued, in, england, few, 16th, century, english, documents, mention, him, archbishop, matthew, parker, 1504, 75, observed, that, his, portraits, were, delineated, and, expressed, to, the, resemblance, of, life, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, miniature, portraitist, nicholas, hilliard, spoke, in, his, treatise, arte, of, limning, of, his, debt, to, holbein, holbein, s, manner, have, i, ever, imitated, and, hold, it, for, the, best, no, account, of, holbein, s, life, was, written, until, karel, van, mander, s, often, inaccurate, schilder, boeck, painter, book, of, 1604, holbein, s, followers, produced, copies, and, versions, of, his, work, but, he, does, not, seem, to, have, founded, a, school, biographer, derek, wilson, calls, him, one, of, the, great, one, offs, of, art, history, the, only, artist, who, appears, to, have, adopted, his, techniques, was, john, bettes, the, elder, whose, man, in, a, black, cap, 1545, is, close, in, style, to, holbein, scholars, differ, about, holbein, s, influence, on, english, art, in, foister, s, view, holbein, had, no, real, successors, and, few, imitators, in, england, the, disparity, between, his, subtle, interrogatory, portraits, of, men, and, women, whose, gazes, follow, us, and, the, stylised, portraits, of, elizabeth, i, and, her, courtiers, can, seem, extreme, the, more, so, as, it, is, difficult, to, trace, a, proper, stylistic, succession, to, holbein, s, work, to, bridge, the, middle, of, the, century, nevertheless, modern, painting, in, england, may, be, said, to, have, begun, with, holbein, that, later, artists, were, aware, of, his, work, is, evident, in, their, own, sometimes, explicitly, hans, eworth, for, example, painted, two, full, length, copies, in, the, 1560s, of, holbein, s, henry, viii, derived, from, the, whitehall, pattern, and, included, a, holbein, in, the, background, of, his, mary, neville, lady, dacre, the, influence, of, holbein, s, monumentality, and, attention, to, texture, has, been, detected, in, eworths, work, according, to, art, historian, erna, auerbach, holbein, s, influence, on, the, style, of, english, portraiture, was, undoubtedly, immense, thanks, to, his, genius, a, portrait, type, was, created, which, both, served, the, requirements, of, the, sitter, and, raised, portraiture, in, england, to, a, european, level, it, became, the, prototype, of, the, english, court, portrait, of, the, renaissance, period, the, fashion, for, old, masters, in, england, after, the, 1620s, created, a, demand, for, holbein, led, by, the, connoisseur, thomas, howard, earl, of, arundel, the, flemish, artists, anthony, van, dyck, and, peter, paul, rubens, discovered, holbein, through, arundel, arundel, commissioned, engravings, of, his, holbeins, from, the, czech, wenceslaus, hollar, some, of, works, now, lost, from, this, time, holbein, s, art, was, also, prized, in, the, netherlands, where, the, picture, dealer, michel, le, blon, became, a, holbein, connoisseur, the, first, catalogue, raisonn, of, holbein, s, work, was, produced, by, the, frenchman, charles, patin, and, the, swiss, sebastian, faesch, in, 1656, they, published, it, with, erasmus,
