heraclitus, h, r, k, l, a, t, s, greek, h, r, kleitos, fl, c, 500, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, pre, socratic, philosopher, from, the, city, of, ephesus, which, was, then, part, of, the, persian, empire, he, exerts, a, wide, influence, on, ancient, and, modern, western, philosophy, including, through, the, works, of, plato, aristotle, hegel, and, heidegger, little, is, known, of, heraclitus, s, life, he, wrote, a, single, work, only, fragments, of, which, have, survived, catalogued, under, philosopher, number, 22, in, the, diels, kranz, numbering, system, already, in, antiquity, his, paradoxical, philosophy, appreciation, for, wordplay, and, cryptic, oracular, epigrams, earned, him, the, epithets, the, dark, and, the, obscure, he, was, considered, arrogant, and, depressed, a, misanthrope, who, was, subject, to, melancholia, consequently, he, became, known, as, the, weeping, philosopher, in, contrast, to, the, ancient, philosopher, democritus, who, was, known, as, the, laughing, philosopher, the, central, ideas, of, heraclitus, s, philosophy, are, the, unity, of, opposites, and, the, concept, of, change, he, also, saw, harmony, and, justice, in, strife, he, viewed, the, world, as, constantly, in, flux, always, becoming, but, never, being, he, expressed, this, in, sayings, like, everything, flows, greek, panta, rhei, and, no, man, ever, steps, in, the, same, river, twice, this, insistence, upon, change, contrasts, with, that, of, the, ancient, philosopher, parmenides, who, believed, in, a, reality, of, static, being, heraclitus, believed, fire, was, the, arche, the, fundamental, stuff, of, the, world, in, choosing, an, arche, heraclitus, followed, the, milesians, before, him, thales, with, water, anaximander, with, apeiron, lit, boundless, or, infinite, and, anaximenes, with, air, heraclitus, also, thought, the, logos, lit, word, discourse, or, reason, gave, structure, to, the, world, heraclitus, the, son, of, blyson, was, from, the, ionian, city, of, ephesus, a, port, on, the, cayster, river, on, the, western, coast, of, asia, minor, modern, day, turkey, in, the, 6th, century, bc, ephesus, like, other, cities, in, ionia, lived, under, the, effects, of, both, the, rise, of, lydia, under, croesus, and, his, overthrow, by, cyrus, the, great, c, 547, bc, ephesus, appears, to, have, subsequently, cultivated, a, close, relationship, with, the, persian, empire, during, the, suppression, of, the, ionian, revolt, by, darius, the, great, in, 494, bc, ephesus, was, spared, and, emerged, as, the, dominant, greek, city, in, ionia, miletus, the, home, to, the, previous, philosophers, was, captured, and, sacked, the, main, source, for, the, life, of, heraclitus, is, the, doxographer, diogenes, la, rtius, although, most, of, the, information, provided, by, laertius, is, unreliable, and, the, ancient, stories, about, heraclitus, are, thought, to, be, later, fabrications, based, on, interpretations, of, the, preserved, fragments, the, anecdote, that, heraclitus, relinquished, the, hereditary, title, of, king, to, his, younger, brother, may, at, least, imply, that, heraclitus, was, from, an, aristocratic, family, in, ephesus, heraclitus, appears, to, have, had, little, sympathy, for, democracy, or, the, masses, however, it, is, unclear, whether, he, was, an, unconditional, partisan, of, the, rich, or, if, like, the, sage, solon, he, was, withdrawn, from, competing, factions, since, antiquity, heraclitus, has, been, labeled, a, solitary, figure, and, an, arrogant, misanthrope, the, skeptic, timon, of, phlius, called, heraclitus, a, mob, abuser, ochloloidoros, heraclitus, considered, himself, self, taught, he, criticized, fools, for, being, put, in, a, flutter, by, every, word, he, did, not, consider, others, incapable, but, unwilling, and, though, reason, is, common, most, people, live, as, though, they, had, an, understanding, peculiar, to, themselves, heraclitus, did, not, seem, to, like, the, prevailing, religion, of, the, time, criticizing, the, popular, mystery, cults, blood, sacrifice, and, prayer, to, statues, he, also, did, not, believe, in, funeral, rites, saying, corpses, are, more, fit, to, be, cast, out, than, dung, he, further, criticized, homer, hesiod, pythagoras, xenophanes, and, hecataeus, he, endorsed, the, sage, bias, of, priene, who, is, quoted, as, saying, most, men, are, bad, he, praised, a, man, named, hermodorus, as, the, best, among, the, ephesians, who, he, says, should, all, kill, themselves, for, exiling, him, heraclitus, is, traditionally, considered, to, have, flourished, in, the, 69th, olympiad, 504, 501, bc, but, this, date, may, simply, be, based, on, a, prior, account, synchronizing, his, life, with, the, reign, of, darius, the, great, however, this, date, can, be, considered, roughly, accurate, based, on, a, fragment, that, references, pythagoras, xenophanes, and, hecataeus, as, older, contemporaries, placing, him, near, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, bc, according, to, diogenes, laertius, heraclitus, died, covered, in, dung, after, failing, to, cure, himself, from, dropsy, this, may, be, to, parody, his, doctrine, that, for, souls, it, is, death, to, become, water, and, that, a, dry, soul, is, best, heraclitus, is, said, to, have, produced, a, single, work, on, papyrus, which, has, not, survived, however, over, 100, fragments, of, this, work, survive, in, quotations, by, other, authors, the, title, is, unknown, but, many, later, writers, refer, to, this, work, and, works, by, other, pre, socratics, as, on, nature, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, heraclitus, deposited, the, book, in, the, artemision, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, as, a, dedication, classicist, charles, kahn, states, down, to, the, time, of, plutarch, and, clement, if, not, later, the, little, book, of, heraclitus, was, available, in, its, original, form, to, any, reader, who, chose, to, seek, it, out, yet, by, the, time, of, simplicius, of, cilicia, a, 6th, century, neoplatonic, philosopher, who, mentions, heraclitus, 32, times, but, never, quotes, from, him, heraclitus, s, work, was, so, rare, that, it, was, unavailable, even, to, simplicius, and, the, other, scholars, at, the, platonic, academy, in, athens, diogenes, la, rtius, wrote, that, the, book, was, divided, into, three, parts, the, universe, politics, and, theology, but, classicists, have, challenged, that, division, classicist, john, burnet, has, argued, that, it, is, not, to, be, supposed, that, this, division, is, due, to, himself, all, we, can, infer, is, that, the, work, fell, naturally, into, these, parts, when, the, stoic, commentators, took, their, editions, of, it, in, hand, the, stoics, divided, their, own, philosophy, into, three, parts, ethics, logic, and, physics, the, stoic, cleanthes, further, divided, philosophy, into, dialectics, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics, and, theology, and, philologist, karl, deichgr, ber, has, argued, the, last, three, are, the, same, as, the, alleged, division, of, heraclitus, the, philosopher, paul, schuster, has, argued, the, division, came, from, the, pinakes, scholar, martin, litchfield, west, claims, that, while, the, existing, fragments, do, not, give, much, of, an, idea, of, the, overall, structure, the, beginning, of, the, discourse, can, probably, be, determined, starting, with, the, opening, lines, which, are, quoted, by, sextus, empiricus, of, the, logos, being, forever, do, men, prove, to, be, uncomprehending, both, before, they, hear, and, once, they, have, heard, it, for, although, all, things, happen, according, to, this, logos, they, are, like, the, unexperienced, experiencing, words, and, deeds, such, as, i, explain, when, i, distinguish, each, thing, according, to, its, nature, and, declare, how, it, is, other, men, are, unaware, of, what, they, do, when, they, are, awake, just, as, they, are, forgetful, of, what, they, do, when, they, are, asleep, heraclitus, s, style, has, been, compared, to, a, sibyl, who, with, raving, lips, uttering, things, mirthless, unbedizened, and, unperfumed, reaches, over, a, thousand, years, with, her, voice, thanks, to, the, god, in, her, kahn, characterized, the, main, features, of, heraclitus, s, writing, as, linguistic, density, meaning, that, single, words, and, phrases, have, multiple, meanings, and, resonance, meaning, that, expressions, evoke, one, another, heraclitus, used, literary, devices, like, alliteration, and, chiasmus, aristotle, quotes, part, of, the, opening, line, of, heraclitus, s, work, in, the, rhetoric, to, outline, the, difficulty, in, punctuating, heraclitus, without, ambiguity, he, debated, whether, forever, applied, to, being, or, to, prove, aristotle, s, successor, at, the, lyceum, theophrastus, says, about, heraclitus, that, some, parts, of, his, work, half, finished, while, other, parts, a, strange, medley, theophrastus, thought, an, inability, to, finish, the, work, showed, heraclitus, was, melancholic, diogenes, la, rtius, relays, the, story, that, the, playwright, euripides, gave, socrates, a, copy, of, heraclitus, s, work, and, asked, for, his, opinion, socrates, replied, the, part, i, understand, is, excellent, and, so, too, is, i, dare, say, the, part, i, do, not, understand, but, it, needs, a, delian, diver, to, get, to, the, bottom, of, it, also, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, timon, of, phlius, called, heraclitus, the, riddler, ainikt, s, a, likely, reference, to, an, alleged, similarity, to, pythagorean, riddles, timon, said, heraclitus, wrote, his, book, rather, unclearly, asaphesteron, according, to, timon, this, was, intended, to, allow, only, the, capable, to, attempt, it, by, the, time, of, cicero, this, epithet, became, in, greek, the, dark, ho, skotein, s, or, in, latin, the, obscure, as, he, had, spoken, nimis, obscur, too, obscurely, concerning, nature, and, had, done, so, deliberately, in, order, to, be, misunderstood, the, obscurity, was, probably, with, the, idea, that, it, is, for, us, to, seek, within, ourselves, as, he, sought, for, himself, and, found, heraclitus, seemed, to, pattern, his, obscurity, after, oracles, heraclitus, did, state, nature, loves, to, hide, and, a, hidden, connection, is, stronger, than, an, obvious, one, he, also, stated, the, lord, whose, oracle, is, in, delphi, neither, speaks, nor, conceals, but, gives, a, sign, heraclitus, is, the, earliest, known, literary, reference, to, the, delphic, maxim, to, know, thyself, heraclitus, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, interpretations, according, to, scholar, daniel, w, graham, heraclitus, has, been, seen, as, a, material, monist, or, a, process, philosopher, a, scientific, cosmologist, a, metaphysician, and, a, religious, thinker, an, empiricist, a, rationalist, a, mystic, a, conventional, thinker, and, a, revolutionary, a, developer, of, logic, one, who, denied, the, law, of, non, contradiction, the, first, genuine, philosopher, and, an, anti, intellectual, obscurantist, the, hallmarks, of, heraclitus, s, philosophy, are, the, unity, of, opposites, and, change, or, flux, according, to, aristotle, heraclitus, was, a, dialetheist, or, one, who, denies, the, law, of, noncontradiction, a, law, of, thought, or, logical, principle, which, states, that, something, cannot, be, true, and, false, at, the, same, time, also, according, to, aristotle, heraclitus, was, a, materialist, attempting, to, follow, aristotle, s, hylomorphic, interpretation, scholar, w, k, c, guthrie, interprets, the, distinction, between, flux, and, stability, as, one, between, matter, and, form, on, this, view, heraclitus, is, a, flux, theorist, because, he, is, a, materialist, who, believes, matter, always, changes, there, are, no, unchanging, forms, like, with, plato, or, aristotle, as, one, author, puts, it, plato, took, flux, as, the, greatest, warning, against, materialism, several, fragments, seem, to, relate, to, the, unity, of, opposites, for, example, the, straight, and, the, crooked, path, of, the, fuller, s, comb, is, one, and, the, same, the, way, up, is, the, way, down, beginning, and, end, on, a, circle, s, circumference, are, common, and, thou, shouldst, unite, things, whole, and, things, not, whole, that, which, tends, to, unite, and, that, which, tends, to, separate, the, harmonious, and, the, discordant, from, all, things, arises, the, one, and, from, the, one, all, things, over, time, the, opposites, change, into, each, other, mortals, are, immortals, and, immortals, are, mortals, the, one, living, the, others, death, and, dying, the, others, life, as, the, same, thing, in, us, is, living, and, dead, waking, and, sleeping, young, and, old, for, these, things, having, changed, around, are, those, and, those, in, turn, having, changed, around, are, these, and, cold, things, warm, up, the, hot, cools, off, wet, becomes, dry, dry, becomes, wet, it, also, seems, they, change, into, each, other, depending, on, one, s, point, of, view, a, case, of, relativism, or, perspectivism, heraclitus, states, disease, makes, health, sweet, and, good, hunger, satiety, toil, rest, while, men, drink, and, wash, with, water, fish, prefer, to, drink, saltwater, pigs, prefer, to, wash, in, mud, and, fowls, prefer, to, wash, in, dust, oxen, are, happy, when, they, find, bitter, vetches, to, eat, and, asses, would, rather, have, refuse, than, gold, diogenes, la, rtius, summarizes, heraclitus, s, philosophy, as, follows, all, things, come, into, being, by, conflict, of, opposites, and, the, sum, of, things, ta, hola, the, whole, flows, like, a, stream, classicist, jonathan, barnes, states, that, panta, rhei, everything, flows, is, probably, the, most, familiar, of, heraclitus, s, sayings, yet, few, modern, scholars, think, he, said, it, barnes, observes, that, although, the, exact, phrase, was, not, ascribed, to, heraclitus, until, the, 6th, century, by, simplicius, a, similar, saying, expressing, the, same, idea, panta, chorei, or, everything, moves, is, ascribed, to, heraclitus, by, plato, in, the, cratylus, since, plato, heraclitus, s, theory, of, flux, has, been, associated, with, the, metaphor, of, a, flowing, river, which, cannot, be, stepped, into, twice, this, fragment, from, heraclitus, s, writings, has, survived, in, three, different, forms, the, classicist, karl, reinhardt, identified, the, first, river, quote, as, the, genuine, one, the, river, fragments, especially, the, second, we, both, are, and, are, not, seem, to, suggest, not, only, is, the, river, constantly, changing, but, we, do, as, well, perhaps, commenting, on, existential, questions, about, humanity, and, personhood, scholars, such, as, reinhardt, also, interpreted, the, metaphor, as, illustrating, what, is, stable, rather, than, the, usual, interpretation, of, illustrating, change, classicist, karl, martin, dietz, has, said, you, will, not, find, anything, in, which, the, river, remains, constant, just, the, fact, that, there, is, a, particular, river, bed, that, there, is, a, source, and, an, estuary, etc, is, something, that, stays, identical, and, this, is, the, concept, of, a, river, according, to, american, philosopher, w, v, o, quine, the, river, parable, illustrates, that, the, river, is, a, process, through, time, one, cannot, step, twice, into, the, same, river, stage, professor, m, m, mccabe, has, argued, that, the, three, statements, on, rivers, should, all, be, read, as, fragments, from, a, discourse, mccabe, suggests, reading, them, as, though, they, arose, in, succession, the, three, fragments, could, be, retained, and, arranged, in, an, argumentative, sequence, in, mccabe, s, reading, of, the, fragments, heraclitus, can, be, read, as, a, philosopher, capable, of, sustained, argument, rather, than, just, aphorism, heraclitus, said, strife, is, justice, and, all, things, take, place, by, strife, he, called, the, opposites, in, conflict, eris, strife, and, theorized, that, the, apparently, unitary, state, dik, justice, results, in, the, most, beautiful, harmony, in, contrast, to, anaximander, who, described, the, same, as, injustice, aristotle, said, heraclitus, disagreed, with, homer, because, homer, wished, that, strife, would, leave, the, world, which, according, to, heraclitus, would, destroy, the, world, there, would, be, no, harmony, without, high, and, low, notes, and, no, animals, without, male, and, female, which, are, opposites, it, may, also, explain, why, he, disagreed, with, the, pythagorean, emphasis, on, harmony, but, not, on, strife, heraclitus, suggests, that, the, world, and, its, various, parts, are, kept, together, through, the, tension, produced, by, the, unity, of, opposites, like, the, string, of, a, bow, or, a, lyre, on, one, account, this, is, the, earliest, use, of, the, concept, of, force, a, quote, about, the, bow, shows, his, appreciation, for, wordplay, the, bow, s, name, is, life, but, its, work, is, death, each, substance, contains, its, opposite, making, for, a, continual, circular, exchange, of, generation, destruction, and, motion, that, results, in, the, stability, of, the, world, this, can, be, illustrated, by, the, quote, even, the, kykeon, separates, if, it, is, not, stirred, according, to, abraham, schoener, war, is, the, central, principle, in, heraclitus, thought, another, of, heraclitus, s, famous, sayings, highlights, the, idea, that, the, unity, of, opposites, is, also, a, conflict, of, opposites, war, is, father, of, all, and, king, of, all, and, some, he, manifested, as, gods, some, as, men, some, he, made, slaves, some, free, war, is, a, creative, tension, that, brings, things, into, existence, heraclitus, says, further, gods, and, men, honour, those, slain, in, war, greater, deaths, gain, greater, portions, and, every, beast, is, tended, by, blows, a, core, concept, for, heraclitus, is, logos, an, ancient, greek, word, literally, meaning, word, speech, discourse, or, meaning, for, heraclitus, the, logos, seems, to, designate, the, rational, structure, or, ordered, composition, of, the, world, as, well, as, the, opening, quote, of, his, book, one, fragment, reads, listening, not, to, me, but, to, the, logos, it, is, wise, to, agree, homologein, that, all, things, are, one, another, fragment, reads, do, not, know, how, to, listen, or, how, to, speak, the, word, logos, has, a, wide, variety, of, other, uses, such, that, heraclitus, might, have, a, different, meaning, of, the, word, for, each, usage, in, his, book, kahn, has, argued, that, heraclitus, used, the, word, in, multiple, senses, whereas, guthrie, has, argued, that, there, is, no, evidence, heraclitus, used, it, in, a, way, that, was, significantly, different, from, that, in, which, it, was, used, by, contemporaneous, speakers, of, greek, professor, michael, stokes, interprets, heraclitus, s, use, of, logos, as, a, public, fact, like, a, proposition, or, formula, like, guthrie, he, views, heraclitus, as, a, materialist, so, he, grants, heraclitus, would, not, have, considered, these, as, abstract, objects, or, immaterial, things, another, possibility, is, the, logos, referred, to, the, truth, or, to, the, book, itself, classicist, walther, kranz, translated, it, as, sense, heraclitus, s, logos, doctrine, may, also, be, the, origin, of, the, doctrine, of, natural, law, heraclitus, stated, people, ought, to, fight, to, keep, their, law, as, to, defend, the, city, walls, for, all, human, laws, get, nourishment, from, the, one, divine, law, far, from, arguing, like, the, latter, sophists, that, the, human, law, because, it, is, a, conventional, law, deserves, to, be, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, law, of, nature, herakleitos, argued, that, the, human, law, partakes, of, the, law, of, nature, which, is, at, the, same, time, a, divine, law, the, milesians, before, heraclitus, had, a, view, called, material, monism, which, conceived, of, certain, elements, as, the, arche, thales, with, water, anaximander, with, apeiron, and, anaximenes, with, air, since, antiquity, philosophers, have, concluded, that, heraclitus, construed, of, fire, as, the, arche, the, ultimate, reality, or, the, fundamental, element, that, gave, rise, to, the, other, elements, pre, socratic, scholar, eduard, zeller, has, argued, that, heraclitus, believed, that, heat, in, general, and, dry, exhalation, in, particular, rather, than, visible, fire, was, the, arche, in, one, fragment, heraclitus, writes, this, world, order, kosmos, the, same, for, all, no, god, nor, man, did, create, but, it, ever, was, and, is, and, will, be, ever, living, fire, kindling, in, measures, and, being, quenched, in, measures, this, is, the, oldest, extant, quote, using, kosmos, or, order, to, mean, the, world, heraclitus, seems, to, say, fire, is, the, one, thing, eternal, in, the, universe, from, fire, all, things, originate, and, all, things, return, again, in, a, process, of, never, ending, cycles, plato, and, aristotle, attribute, to, heraclitus, a, periodic, destruction, of, the, world, by, a, great, conflagration, known, as, ekpyrosis, which, happens, every, great, year, according, to, plato, every, 36, 000, years, heraclitus, more, than, once, describes, the, transformations, to, and, from, fire, fire, lives, the, death, of, earth, and, air, lives, the, death, of, fire, water, lives, the, death, of, air, and, earth, that, of, water, the, turnings, of, fire, first, sea, and, of, sea, half, is, earth, half, fireburst, is, liquefied, as, sea, and, measured, into, the, same, proportion, as, it, had, before, it, became, earth, however, it, is, also, argued, by, many, that, heraclitus, never, identified, fire, as, the, arche, rather, he, only, used, fire, to, explain, his, notion, of, flux, as, the, basic, stuff, which, changes, or, moves, the, most, others, conclude, he, used, it, as, the, physical, form, of, logos, on, yet, another, interpretation, heraclitus, is, not, a, material, monist, explicating, flux, nor, stability, but, a, revolutionary, process, philosopher, who, chooses, fire, in, an, attempt, to, say, there, is, no, arche, fire, is, a, symbol, or, metaphor, for, change, rather, than, the, basic, stuff, which, changes, the, most, perspectives, of, this, sort, emphasize, his, statements, on, change, such, as, the, way, up, is, the, way, down, as, well, as, the, quote, all, things, are, an, exchange, for, fire, and, fire, for, all, things, even, as, wares, for, gold, and, gold, for, wares, which, has, been, understood, as, stating, that, while, all, can, be, transformed, into, fire, not, everything, comes, from, fire, just, as, not, everything, comes, from, gold, while, considered, an, ancient, cosmologist, heraclitus, did, not, seem, as, interested, in, astronomy, meteorology, or, mathematics, as, his, predecessors, it, is, surmised, heraclitus, believed, that, the, earth, was, flat, and, extended, infinitely, in, all, directions, heraclitus, held, all, things, occur, according, to, fate, he, said, time, aion, is, a, child, playing, draughts, the, kingly, power, is, a, child, s, it, is, disputed, whether, this, means, time, and, life, is, determined, by, rules, like, a, game, by, conflict, like, a, game, or, by, arbitrary, whims, of, the, gods, like, a, child, plays, similar, to, his, views, on, rivers, heraclitus, believed, the, sun, is, new, each, day, he, also, said, the, sun, never, sets, this, was, obviously, inspired, by, scientific, reflection, and, no, doubt, seemed, to, him, to, obviate, the, difficulty, of, understanding, how, the, sun, can, work, its, way, underground, from, west, to, east, during, the, night, the, physician, galen, explains, heraclitus, says, that, the, sun, is, a, burning, mass, kindled, at, its, rising, and, quenched, at, its, setting, heraclitus, also, believed, that, the, sun, is, as, large, as, it, looks, and, said, hesiod, did, not, know, night, and, day, for, they, are, one, however, he, also, explained, the, phenomenon, of, day, and, night, by, if, the, sun, oversteps, his, measures, then, erinyes, the, ministers, of, justice, will, find, him, out, heraclitus, further, wrote, the, sun, is, in, charge, of, the, seasons, on, one, account, heraclitus, believed, the, sun, and, moon, were, bowls, containing, fire, with, lunar, phases, explained, by, the, turning, of, the, bowl, his, study, of, the, moon, near, the, end, of, the, month, is, contained, in, one, of, the, oxyrhynchus, papyri, a, group, of, manuscripts, found, in, an, ancient, landfill, this, is, the, best, evidence, of, heraclitean,

animals, aristotle, relays, this, story, heraclitus, when, the, strangers, who, came, to, visit, him, found, him, warming, himself, at, the, furnace, in, the, kitchen, and, hesitated, to, go, in, reported, to, have, bidden, them, not, to, be, afraid, to, enter, as, even, in, that, kitchen, divinities, were, present, so, we, should, venture, on, the, study, of, every, kind, of, animal, without, distaste, for, each, and, all, will, reveal, to, us, something, natural, and, something, beautiful, the, phrase, ethos, anthropoi, daimon, is, attributed, to, heraclitus, it, is, variously, translated, as, a, man, s, character, is, his, fate, character, is, destiny, or, perhaps, most, literally, as, a, man, s, character, is, his, guardian, divinity, the, word, ethos, means, character, while, daimon, has, various, meanings, one, of, which, being, the, power, controlling, the, destiny, of, individuals, hence, one, s, lot, or, fortune, heraclitus, believed, the, soul, psyche, was, complex, stating, the, limits, of, the, soul, you, could, not, discover, though, traversing, every, path, heraclitus, regarded, the, soul, as, a, mixture, of, fire, and, water, and, believed, that, fire, was, the, noble, part, of, the, soul, and, water, the, ignoble, part, he, considered, mastery, of, one, s, worldly, desires, to, be, a, noble, pursuit, that, purified, the, soul, s, fire, while, drunkenness, damages, the, soul, by, causing, it, to, be, moist, heraclitus, seems, to, advise, against, anger, it, is, hard, to, fight, with, anger, for, what, it, wants, it, buys, at, the, price, of, the, soul, heraclitus, associates, being, awake, with, comprehension, as, sextus, empiricus, explains, it, is, by, drawing, in, this, divine, reason, in, respiration, that, we, become, endowed, with, mind, and, in, sleep, we, become, forgetful, but, in, waking, we, regain, our, senses, for, in, sleep, the, passages, of, perception, are, shut, and, hence, the, mind, the, only, thing, preserved, is, the, connection, through, breathing, heraclitus, stated, if, all, things, should, become, smoke, then, perception, would, be, by, the, nostrils, heraclitus, compares, the, soul, to, a, spider, and, the, body, to, the, web, heraclitus, believed, the, soul, is, what, unifies, the, body, and, also, what, grants, linguistic, understanding, departing, from, homer, s, conception, of, it, as, merely, the, breath, of, life, heraclitus, ridicules, homer, s, conception, of, souls, in, the, afterlife, as, shades, by, saying, souls, smell, in, hades, his, own, views, on, the, afterlife, remain, unclear, but, heraclitus, did, state, there, await, men, after, they, are, dead, things, which, they, do, not, expect, or, imagine, the, aristotelian, tradition, is, responsible, for, a, great, part, of, the, transmission, of, heraclitus, s, physical, conception, of, the, soul, aristotle, wrote, in, de, anima, heraclitus, too, says, that, the, first, principle, the, warm, exhalation, of, which, according, to, him, everything, else, is, composed, is, soul, further, that, this, exhalation, is, most, incorporeal, and, in, ceaseless, flux, heraclitus, s, originality, and, placement, near, the, beginning, of, greek, philosophy, has, resulted, in, several, writers, looking, for, possible, influence, from, the, surrounding, nations, the, persian, empire, had, a, close, connection, with, ephesus, and, zoroastrianism, was, the, state, religion, of, the, persian, empire, heraclitus, s, emphasis, on, fire, has, been, investigated, for, influence, from, zoroastrian, fire, worship, and, specifically, the, concept, of, atar, while, many, of, the, doctrines, of, zoroastrian, fire, do, not, match, exactly, with, those, of, heraclitus, such, as, the, relation, of, fire, to, earth, it, is, still, argued, he, may, have, taken, some, inspiration, from, them, zoroastrian, parallels, to, heraclitus, are, often, difficult, to, identify, specifically, due, to, a, lack, of, surviving, zoroastrian, literature, from, the, period, and, mutual, influence, with, greek, philosophy, the, interchange, of, other, elements, with, fire, also, has, parallels, in, vedic, literature, from, the, same, time, period, such, as, the, upanishads, the, taittiriya, upanishad, for, instance, states, fire, is, established, in, water, water, is, established, in, fire, heraclitus, may, have, also, been, influenced, by, a, vedic, meditation, known, as, the, doctrine, of, the, five, fires, west, however, stresses, that, these, doctrines, of, the, interchange, of, elements, were, common, throughout, written, works, on, philosophy, that, have, survived, from, that, period, so, heraclitus, s, doctrine, of, fire, can, not, be, definitively, said, to, have, been, influenced, by, any, other, particular, iranian, or, indian, influence, but, may, have, been, part, of, a, mutual, interchange, of, influence, over, time, across, the, ancient, near, east, philosopher, gustav, teichm, ller, sought, to, prove, heraclitus, was, influenced, by, the, egyptians, either, directly, by, reading, the, book, of, the, dead, or, indirectly, through, the, greek, mystery, cults, as, the, sun, of, heraclitus, was, daily, generated, from, water, so, horus, as, ra, of, the, sun, daily, proceeded, from, lotus, the, water, paul, tannery, took, up, teichm, ller, s, interpretation, they, both, thought, heraclitus, s, book, was, an, offering, to, the, temple, to, be, read, only, by, few, initiates, rather, than, deposited, in, the, temple, to, the, public, for, safe, keeping, edmund, pfleiderer, argued, that, heraclitus, was, influenced, by, the, mystery, cults, he, interprets, heraclitus, s, apparent, condemning, of, the, mystery, cults, as, the, condemning, of, abuses, rather, than, the, idea, itself, heraclitus, s, writings, have, exerted, a, wide, influence, on, western, philosophy, including, the, works, of, plato, and, aristotle, who, interpreted, him, in, terms, of, their, own, doctrines, his, influence, also, extends, into, art, literature, and, even, medicine, as, writings, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, show, signs, of, heraclitean, themes, heraclitus, is, also, considered, a, potential, source, for, understanding, the, ancient, greek, religion, since, the, discovery, of, the, derveni, papyrus, an, orphic, poem, which, contains, two, fragments, of, heraclitus, it, is, unknown, whether, or, not, heraclitus, had, any, students, in, his, lifetime, diogenes, laertius, states, heraclitus, s, book, won, so, great, a, fame, that, there, arose, followers, of, him, called, heracliteans, scholars, took, this, to, mean, heraclitus, had, no, disciples, and, became, renowned, only, after, his, death, according, to, one, author, the, school, of, disciples, founded, by, heraclitus, flourished, for, long, after, his, death, according, to, another, there, were, no, doubt, other, heracliteans, whose, names, are, now, lost, to, us, in, his, dialogue, cratylus, plato, presented, cratylus, as, a, heraclitean, and, as, a, linguistic, naturalist, who, believed, that, names, must, apply, naturally, to, their, objects, according, to, aristotle, cratylus, went, a, step, beyond, his, master, s, doctrine, and, said, that, one, cannot, step, into, the, same, river, once, he, took, the, view, that, nothing, can, be, said, about, the, ever, changing, world, and, ended, by, thinking, that, one, need, not, say, anything, and, only, moved, his, finger, to, explain, both, characterizations, by, plato, and, aristotle, cratylus, may, have, thought, continuous, change, warrants, skepticism, because, one, cannot, define, a, thing, that, does, not, have, a, permanent, nature, diogenes, laertius, also, lists, an, otherwise, historically, obscure, antisthenes, who, wrote, a, commentary, on, heraclitus, the, pythagorean, and, comic, writer, epicharmus, of, kos, has, fragments, which, seem, to, reproduce, the, thought, of, heraclitus, and, wrote, a, play, titled, heraclitus, parmenides, of, elea, a, philosopher, and, near, contemporary, proposed, a, doctrine, of, changelessness, in, contrast, to, the, doctrine, of, flux, put, forth, by, heraclitus, he, is, generally, agreed, to, either, have, influenced, or, been, influenced, by, heraclitus, different, philosophers, have, argued, that, either, one, of, them, may, have, substantially, influenced, each, other, some, taking, heraclitus, to, be, responding, to, parmenides, but, more, often, parmenides, is, seen, as, responding, to, heraclitus, some, also, argue, that, any, direct, chain, of, influence, between, the, two, is, impossible, to, determine, although, heraclitus, refers, to, older, figures, such, as, pythagoras, neither, parmenides, or, heraclitus, refer, to, each, other, by, name, in, any, surviving, fragments, so, any, speculation, on, influence, must, be, based, on, interpretation, the, surviving, fragments, of, several, other, pre, socratic, philosophers, show, heraclitean, themes, diogenes, of, apollonia, thought, the, action, of, one, thing, on, another, meant, they, were, made, of, one, substance, the, pluralists, may, have, been, influenced, by, heraclitus, the, philosopher, anaxagoras, refuses, to, separate, the, opposites, in, the, one, cosmos, empedocles, has, forces, arguably, the, first, since, heraclitus, s, tension, which, are, in, opposition, known, as, love, and, hate, or, more, accurately, harmony, and, strife, democritus, and, the, atomists, were, also, influenced, by, heraclitus, the, atomists, and, heraclitus, both, believed, that, everything, was, in, motion, on, one, interpretation, essentially, what, the, atomists, did, was, try, to, find, a, middle, way, between, the, contradictory, philosophical, schemes, of, heraclitus, and, parmenides, the, sophists, including, protagoras, of, abdera, and, gorgias, of, leontini, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, heraclitus, sophists, in, general, seemed, to, share, heraclitus, s, conception, of, the, logos, one, tradition, associated, the, sophists, concern, with, politics, and, preventing, party, strife, with, heraclitus, heraclitus, and, others, used, measure, to, mean, the, balance, and, order, of, nature, hence, protagoras, famous, statement, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, in, plato, s, dialogue, theaetetus, socrates, sees, protagoras, s, man, is, the, measure, doctrine, and, theaetetus, hypothesis, that, knowledge, is, perception, as, justified, by, heraclitean, flux, gorgias, seems, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, logos, when, he, argued, in, his, work, on, non, being, possibly, parodying, the, eleatics, that, being, cannot, exist, or, be, communicated, according, to, one, author, gorgias, in, a, sense, completes, heraclitus, plato, knew, of, the, teachings, of, heraclitus, through, the, heraclitean, philosopher, cratylus, plato, held, that, for, heraclitus, knowledge, is, made, impossible, by, the, flux, of, sensible, objects, and, thus, the, need, for, the, imperceptible, forms, as, objects, of, knowledge, scythinus, of, teos, a, contemporary, of, plato, wrote, out, heraclitus, s, philosophy, in, verse, a, four, volume, work, on, heraclitus, was, written, by, the, academic, heraclides, ponticus, but, has, not, survived, plutarch, also, wrote, a, lost, treatise, on, heraclitus, the, neoplatonists, were, influenced, by, heraclitus, on, the, topic, of, the, one, quoting, plotinus, heraclitus, with, his, sense, of, bodily, forms, as, things, of, ceaseless, process, and, passage, knows, the, one, as, eternal, and, intellectual, aristotle, accused, heraclitus, of, denying, the, law, of, noncontradiction, and, charges, that, he, thereby, failed, in, his, reasoning, however, aristotle, s, material, monist, and, world, conflagration, ekpyrosis, interpretation, of, heraclitus, influenced, the, stoics, the, stoics, believed, major, tenets, of, their, philosophy, derived, from, the, thought, of, heraclitus, especially, the, logos, used, to, support, their, belief, that, rational, law, governs, the, universe, scholar, a, a, long, concludes, the, earliest, stoic, fragments, are, modifications, of, heraclitus, according, to, philosopher, philip, hallie, heraclitus, of, ephesus, was, the, father, of, stoic, physics, a, four, volume, work, titled, interpretation, of, heraclitus, was, written, by, the, stoic, philosopher, cleanthes, but, has, not, survived, in, surviving, stoic, writings, heraclitean, influence, is, most, evident, in, the, writings, of, marcus, aurelius, marcus, aurelius, understood, the, logos, as, the, account, which, governs, everything, heraclitus, also, states, we, should, not, act, and, speak, like, children, of, our, parents, which, marcus, aurelius, interpreted, to, mean, one, should, not, simply, accept, what, others, believe, many, of, the, later, stoics, interpreted, the, logos, as, the, arche, as, a, creative, fire, that, ran, through, all, things, west, observes, that, plato, aristotle, theophrastus, and, sextus, empiricus, all, make, no, mention, of, this, doctrine, and, concludes, that, the, language, and, thought, are, obviously, stoic, and, not, attributable, to, heraclitus, burnet, cautions, that, these, stoic, modifications, of, heraclitus, make, it, harder, to, interpret, heraclitus, himself, as, the, stoics, ascribed, their, own, interpretations, of, terms, like, logos, and, ekpyrosis, to, heraclitus, the, cynics, were, influenced, by, heraclitus, such, as, by, his, condemnation, of, the, mystery, cults, heraclitus, is, sometimes, even, depicted, as, a, cynic, the, cynics, attributed, several, of, the, later, cynic, epistles, to, his, authorship, according, to, one, source, the, cynic, affinity, with, heraclitus, lies, not, so, much, in, his, philosophy, as, in, his, cultural, criticism, and, idealised, lifestyle, heraclitus, wrote, dogs, bark, at, every, one, they, do, not, know, similarly, diogenes, the, cynic, when, asked, by, alexander, why, he, considered, himself, a, dog, responded, that, he, barks, at, those, who, give, me, nothing, the, skeptical, philosophers, known, as, pyrrhonists, were, also, influenced, by, heraclitus, he, may, be, the, predecessor, to, pyrrho, s, relativistic, doctrine, no, more, this, than, that, that, nothing, is, one, way, rather, than, another, way, according, to, pyrrhonist, sextus, empiricus, aenesidemus, one, of, the, major, ancient, pyrrhonist, philosophers, claimed, in, a, now, lost, work, that, pyrrhonism, was, a, way, to, heraclitean, philosophy, because, pyrrhonist, practice, helps, one, to, see, how, opposites, appear, to, be, the, case, about, the, same, thing, leading, to, the, heraclitean, view, that, opposites, actually, are, true, about, the, same, thing, sextus, empiricus, disagreed, arguing, opposites, appearing, to, be, the, case, about, the, same, thing, is, not, a, dogma, of, the, pyrrhonists, but, a, matter, occurring, to, the, pyrrhonists, to, the, other, philosophers, and, to, all, of, humanity, heraclitus, was, often, read, by, early, christian, philosophers, who, following, the, stoics, interpreted, the, logos, as, meaning, the, christian, word, of, god, such, as, in, john, 1, 1, in, the, beginning, was, the, word, logos, and, the, word, was, god, hippolytus, of, rome, one, of, the, early, church, fathers, of, the, christian, church, identified, heraclitus, along, with, the, other, pre, socratics, and, academics, as, a, source, of, heresy, in, heraclitus, s, case, namely, the, heresy, of, noetus, the, christian, apologist, justin, martyr, took, a, more, positive, view, of, heraclitus, in, his, first, apology, he, said, both, socrates, and, heraclitus, were, christians, before, christ, those, who, lived, reasonably, are, christians, even, though, they, have, been, thought, atheists, as, among, the, greeks, socrates, and, heraclitus, and, men, like, them, the, christian, clement, of, alexandria, notes, heraclitus, s, similarity, to, the, christian, prophets, and, is, cited, as, a, source, for, more, heraclitus, fragments, than, any, other, author, modern, scholars, such, as, john, burnet, have, viewed, the, relationship, between, heraclitean, logos, and, johannine, logos, as, fallacious, saying, the, johannine, doctrine, of, the, logos, has, nothing, to, do, with, herakleitos, or, with, anything, at, all, in, greek, philosophy, but, comes, from, the, hebrew, wisdom, literature, when, heraclitus, speaks, of, god, he, does, not, mean, a, single, deity, as, an, omnipotent, and, omniscient, or, god, as, creator, the, universe, being, eternal, he, meant, the, divine, as, opposed, to, human, the, immortal, as, opposed, to, the, mortal, and, the, cyclical, as, opposed, to, the, transient, thus, it, is, arguably, more, accurate, to, speak, of, the, divine, and, not, of, god, heraclitus, s, influence, also, extends, outside, of, philosophy, a, motif, found, in, art, and, literature, is, heraclitus, as, the, weeping, philosopher, and, democritus, as, the, laughing, philosopher, which, may, have, originated, with, the, cynic, philosopher, menippus, and, generally, references, their, reactions, to, the, folly, of, mankind, for, example, in, lucian, of, samosata, s, philosophies, for, sale, heraclitus, is, auctioned, off, as, the, weeping, philosopher, and, democritus, as, the, laughing, philosopher, the, roman, poet, juvenal, wrote, heraclitus, weep, at, life, much, more, than, you, did, while, alive, for, now, life, is, more, pitiable, the, renaissance, saw, a, revived, interest, in, ancient, philosophy, and, its, depiction, in, art, a, fresco, on, the, wall, of, marsilio, ficino, s, platonic, academy, in, florence, depicted, heraclitus, and, democritus, donato, bramante, painted, heraclitus, and, democritus, 1486, as, the, weeping, and, laughing, philosopher, and, may, have, depicted, heraclitus, as, leonardo, da, vinci, heraclitus, appears, in, painter, raphael, s, school, of, athens, 1511, in, which, he, is, represented, by, michelangelo, since, they, shared, a, sour, temper, and, bitter, scorn, for, all, rivals, modern, interest, in, early, greek, philosophy, can, be, traced, back, to, 1573, when, french, printer, henri, estienne, also, known, as, henricus, stephanus, collected, a, number, of, pre, socratic, fragments, including, some, forty, of, those, of, heraclitus, and, published, them, in, latin, in, poesis, philosophica, renaissance, skeptic, michel, de, montaigne, s, essay, on, democritus, and, heraclitus, in, which, he, sided, with, the, laughing, philosopher, over, the, weeping, philosopher, was, probably, written, soon, after, heraclitus, also, influenced, french, poets, michel, d, ambroise, and, etienne, forcadel, huguenot, minister, pierre, du, moulin, wrote, heraclitus, or, meditations, vpon, the, vanity, misery, of, humane, life, in, 1609, english, playwright, william, shakespeare, may, have, known, of, heraclitus, through, montaigne, the, merchant, of, venice, 1598, features, the, melancholic, character, of, antonio, who, some, critics, contend, is, modeled, after, heraclitus, additionally, in, one, scene, of, the, play, portia, assesses, her, potential, suitors, and, says, of, one, county, palatine, i, fear, he, will, prove, the, weeping, philosopher, when, he, grows, old, several, baroque, artists, such, as, peter, paul, rubens, hendrik, ter, brugghen, and, johannes, moreelse, painted, heraclitus, and, democritus, rubens, heraclitus, and, democritus, 1603, was, painted, for, the, duke, of, lerma, french, rationalist, philosopher, ren, descartes, read, montaigne, and, wrote, in, the, passions, of, the, soul, that, indignation, can, be, joined, by, pity, or, derision, so, the, laughter, of, democritus, and, the, tears, of, heraclitus, could, have, come, from, the, same, cause, according, to, one, author, what, heraclitus, really, meant, by, the, common, was, nothing, different, from, what, by, spinoza, was, expressed, by, sub, specie, aeternitatis, according, to, german, poet, heinrich, bl, cher, if, you, read, the, whole, system, of, spinoza, it, is, nothing, but, the, changed, system, of, heraclitus, kahn, suggests, spinoza, may, have, been, influenced, by, heraclitus, via, the, stoics, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, stated, in, the, monadology, all, bodies, are, in, a, state, of, perpetual, flux, like, rivers, bishop, and, empiricist, philosopher, george, berkeley, claimed, sir, isaac, newton, s, alchemy, was, influenced, by, heraclitus, he, remarked, in, siris, in, plutarch, we, find, it, was, the, opinion, of, heraclitus, that, the, death, of, fire, was, a, birth, to, air, and, the, death, of, air, a, birth, to, water, this, opinion, is, also, maintained, by, sir, isaac, newton, scottish, skeptic, david, hume, seems, to, recapitulate, heraclitus, while, discussing, personal, identity, thus, as, the, nature, of, a, river, consists, in, the, motion, and, change, of, parts, tho, in, less, than, four, and, twenty, hours, these, be, totally, alter, d, this, hinders, not, the, river, from, continuing, the, same, during, several, ages, while, heraclitus, seems, to, criticize, people, in, general, at, other, times, he, also, seems, to, support, common, sense, on, scottish, common, sense, philosopher, thomas, reid, s, account, heraclitus, was, one, of, the, first, to, extol, a, common, sense, philosophy, with, such, quotes, as, and, though, reason, is, common, most, people, live, as, though, they, had, an, understanding, peculiar, to, themselves, and, understanding, is, common, to, all, ever, since, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, philosophers, have, sometimes, been, divided,

mayer, has, argued, that, the, philosophical, pessimism, of, arthur, schopenhauer, recapitulated, the, thought, of, heraclitus, the, impression, of, heraclitus, on, german, idealist, g, w, f, hegel, was, so, profound, that, he, remarked, in, his, lectures, on, the, history, of, philosophy, there, is, no, proposition, of, heraclitus, which, i, have, not, adopted, in, my, logic, hegel, interpreted, heraclitus, as, a, dialetheist, and, as, a, process, philosopher, seeing, the, flux, or, becoming, in, heraclitus, as, a, natural, result, of, the, ontology, of, being, and, non, being, in, parmenides, he, also, doubted, the, world, conflagration, ekpyrosis, interpretation, which, had, been, popular, since, aristotle, the, german, theologian, friedrich, schleiermacher, was, one, of, the, first, to, collect, the, fragments, of, heraclitus, specifically, and, write, them, out, in, his, native, tongue, the, pioneer, of, heraclitean, studies, schleiermacher, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, posit, persian, influence, upon, heraclitus, a, question, taken, up, by, succeeding, scholars, friedrich, creuzer, and, august, gladisch, the, young, hegelian, and, socialist, ferdinand,
