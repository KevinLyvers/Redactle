legal, career, however, those, two, years, in, salamanca, plus, his, long, period, of, training, and, experience, as, a, notary, first, in, valladolid, and, later, in, hispaniola, gave, him,

the, new, world, before, them, in, order, to, secure, personal, advantages, quintero, s, mutinous, conduct, may, have, served, as, a, model, for, cort, s, in, his, subsequent, career, upon, his, arrival, in, 1504, in, santo, domingo, the, capital, of, hispaniola, the, 18, year, old, cort, s, registered, as, a, citizen, this, entitled, him, to, a, building, plot, and, land, to, farm, soon,

fifth, of, the, profits, from, the, expedition, vel, zquez, was, so, impressed, with, cort, s, that, he, secured, a, high, political, position, for, him, in, the, colony, he, became, secretary, for, governor, vel, zquez, cort, s, was, twice, appointed, municipal, magistrate, alcalde, of, santiago, in, cuba, cort, s, became, a, man, of, substance, with, an, encomienda, to, provide, indian, labor,

led, a, group, which, demanded, that, more, indians, be, assigned, to, the, settlers, as, time, went, on, relations, between, cort, s, and, governor, vel, zquez, became, strained, cort, s, found, time, to, become, romantically, involved, with, catalina, xu, rez, or, ju, rez, the, sister, in, law, of, governor, vel, zquez, part, of, vel, zquez, s, displeasure, seems, to, have, been, based, on, a, belief, that, cort, s, was, trifling, with, catalina, s, affections, cort, s, was, temporarily, distracted, by, one, of, catalina, s, sisters, but, finally, married, catalina, reluctantly, under, pressure, from, governor, vel, zquez, however, by, doing, so, he, hoped, to, secure, the, good, will, of, both, her, family, and, that, of, vel, zquez, it, was, not, until, he, had, been, almost, 15, years, in, the, indies, that, cort, s, began, to, look, beyond, his, substantial, status, as, mayor, of, the, capital, of, cuba, and, as, a, man, of, affairs, in, the, thriving, colony, he, missed, the, first, two, expeditions, under, the, orders, of, francisco, hern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, and, then, juan, de, grijalva, sent, by, diego, vel, zquez, to, mexico, in, 1518, news, reached, vel, zquez, that, juan, de, grijalva, had, established, a, colony, on, the, mainland, where, there, was, a, bonanza, of, silver, and, gold, and, vel, zquez, decided, to, send, him, help, cort, s, was, appointed, captain, general, of, this, new, expedition, in, october, 1518, but, was, advised, to, move, fast, before, vel, zquez, changed, his, mind, with, cort, s, s, experience, as, an, administrator, knowledge, gained, from, many, failed, expeditions, and, his, impeccable, rhetoric, he, was, able, to, gather, six, ships, and, 300, men, within, a, month, vel, zquez, s, jealousy, exploded, and, he, decided, to, put, the, expedition, in, other, hands, however, cort, s, quickly, gathered, more, men, and, ships, in, other, cuban, ports, in, 1518, vel, zquez, put, cort, s, in, command, of, an, expedition, to, explore, and, secure, the, interior, of, mexico, for, colonization, at, the, last, minute, due, to, the, old, argument, between, the, two, vel, zquez, changed, his, mind, and, revoked, cort, s, s, charter, cort, s, ignored, the, orders, and, in, an, act, of, open, mutiny, went, anyway, in, february, 1519, he, stopped, in, trinidad, cuba, to, hire, more, soldiers, and, obtain, more, horses, accompanied, by, about, 11, ships, 500, men, including, seasoned, slaves, 13, horses, and, a, small, number, of, cannons, cort, s, landed, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, in, maya, territory, there, he, encountered, geronimo, de, aguilar, a, spanish, franciscan, priest, who, had, survived, a, shipwreck, followed, by, a, period, in, captivity, with, the, maya, before, escaping, aguilar, had, learned, the, chontal, maya, language, and, was, able, to, translate, for, cort, s, cort, s, s, military, experience, was, almost, nonexistent, but, he, proved, to, be, an, effective, leader, of, his, small, army, and, won, early, victories, over, the, coastal, indians, in, march, 1519, cort, s, formally, claimed, the, land, for, the, spanish, crown, then, he, proceeded, to, tabasco, where, he, met, with, resistance, and, won, a, battle, against, the, natives, he, received, twenty, young, indigenous, women, from, the, vanquished, natives, and, he, converted, them, all, to, christianity, among, these, women, was, la, malinche, his, future, mistress, and, mother, of, his, son, mart, n, malinche, knew, both, the, nahuatl, language, and, chontal, maya, thus, enabling, cort, s, to, communicate, with, the, aztecs, through, aguilar, 82, 86, 87, at, san, juan, de, ul, a, on, easter, sunday, 1519, cort, s, met, with, moctezuma, ii, s, aztec, empire, governors, tendile, and, pitalpitoque, 89, in, july, 1519, his, men, took, over, veracruz, by, this, act, cort, s, dismissed, the, authority, of, the, governor, of, cuba, to, place, himself, directly, under, the, orders, of, king, charles, to, eliminate, any, ideas, of, retreat, cort, s, scuttled, his, ships, in, veracruz, he, met, some, of, the, tributaries, of, the, aztecs, and, asked, them, to, arrange, a, meeting, with, moctezuma, ii, the, tlatoani, ruler, of, the, aztec, empire, moctezuma, repeatedly, turned, down, the, meeting, but, cort, s, was, determined, leaving, a, hundred, men, in, veracruz, cort, s, marched, on, tenochtitl, n, in, mid, august, 1519, along, with, 600, soldiers, 15, horsemen, 15, cannons, and, hundreds, of, indigenous, carriers, and, warriors, on, the, way, to, tenochtitl, n, cort, s, made, alliances, with, indigenous, peoples, such, as, the, totonacs, of, cempoala, and, the, nahuas, of, tlaxcala, the, otomis, initially, and, then, the, tlaxcalans, clashed, with, the, spanish, in, a, series, of, three, battles, from, 2, to, 5, september, 1519, and, at, one, point, diaz, remarked, they, surrounded, us, on, every, side, after, cort, s, continued, to, release, prisoners, with, messages, of, peace, and, realizing, the, spanish, were, enemies, of, moctezuma, xicotencatl, the, elder, and, maxixcatzin, persuaded, the, tlaxcalan, warleader, xicotencatl, the, younger, that, it, would, be, better, to, ally, with, the, newcomers, than, to, kill, them, 143, 155, 171, in, october, 1519, cort, s, and, his, men, accompanied, by, about, 1, 000, tlaxcalteca, 188, marched, to, cholula, the, second, largest, city, in, central, mexico, cort, s, either, in, a, pre, meditated, effort, to, instill, fear, upon, the, aztecs, waiting, for, him, at, tenochtitlan, or, as, he, later, claimed, when, he, was, being, investigated, wishing, to, make, an, example, when, he, feared, native, treachery, massacred, thousands, of, unarmed, members, of, the, nobility, gathered, at, the, central, plaza, then, partially, burned, the, city, 199, 200, by, the, time, he, arrived, in, tenochtitl, n, the, spaniards, had, a, large, army, on, november, 8, 1519, they, were, peacefully, received, by, moctezuma, ii, moctezuma, deliberately, let, cort, s, enter, the, aztec, capital, the, island, city, of, tenochtitl, n, hoping, to, get, to, know, their, weaknesses, better, and, to, crush, them, later, moctezuma, gave, lavish, gifts, of, gold, to, the, spaniards, which, rather, than, placating, them, excited, their, ambitions, for, plunder, in, his, letters, to, king, charles, cort, s, claimed, to, have, learned, at, this, point, that, he, was, considered, by, the, aztecs, to, be, either, an, emissary, of, the, feathered, serpent, god, quetzalcoatl, or, quetzalcoatl, himself, a, belief, which, has, been, contested, by, a, few, modern, historians, but, quickly, cort, s, learned, that, several, spaniards, on, the, coast, had, been, killed, by, aztecs, while, supporting, the, totonacs, and, decided, to, take, moctezuma, as, a, hostage, in, his, palace, indirectly, ruling, tenochtitl, n, through, him, meanwhile, vel, zquez, sent, another, expedition, led, by, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, to, oppose, cort, s, arriving, in, mexico, in, april, 1520, with, 1, 100, men, cort, s, left, 200, men, in, tenochtitl, n, and, took, the, rest, to, confront, narv, ez, he, overcame, narv, ez, despite, his, numerical, inferiority, and, convinced, the, rest, of, narv, ez, s, men, to, join, him, in, mexico, one, of, cort, s, s, lieutenants, pedro, de, alvarado, committed, the, massacre, in, the, great, temple, triggering, a, local, rebellion, cort, s, speedily, returned, to, tenochtitl, n, on, july, 1, 1520, moctezuma, was, killed, he, was, stoned, to, death, by, his, own, people, as, reported, in, spanish, accounts, although, some, claim, he, was, murdered, by, the, spaniards, once, they, realized, his, inability, to, placate, the, locals, faced, with, a, hostile, population, cort, s, decided, to, flee, for, tlaxcala, during, the, noche, triste, june, 30, july, 1, 1520, the, spaniards, managed, a, narrow, escape, from, tenochtitl, n, across, the, tlacopan, causeway, while, their, rearguard, was, being, massacred, much, of, the, treasure, looted, by, cort, s, was, lost, as, well, as, his, artillery, during, this, panicked, escape, from, tenochtitl, n, after, a, battle, in, otumba, they, managed, to, reach, tlaxcala, having, lost, 870, men, with, the, assistance, of, their, allies, cort, s, s, men, finally, prevailed, with, reinforcements, arriving, from, cuba, cort, s, began, a, policy, of, attrition, towards, tenochtitl, n, cutting, off, supplies, and, subduing, the, aztecs, allied, cities, during, the, siege, he, would, construct, brigantines, in, the, lake, and, slowly, destroy, blocks, of, the, city, to, avoid, fighting, in, an, urban, setting, the, mexicas, would, fall, back, to, tlatelolco, and, even, succeed, in, ambushing, the, pursuing, spanish, forces, inflicting, heavy, losses, but, would, ultimately, be, the, last, portion, of, the, island, that, resisted, the, conquistadores, the, siege, of, tenochtitlan, ended, with, spanish, victory, and, the, destruction, of, the, city, in, january, 1521, cort, s, countered, a, conspiracy, against, him, headed, by, antonio, de, villafana, who, was, hanged, for, the, offense, finally, with, the, capture, of, cuauht, moc, the, tlatoani, ruler, of, tenochtitl, n, on, august, 13, 1521, the, aztec, empire, was, captured, and, cort, s, was, able, to, claim, it, for, spain, thus, renaming, the, city, mexico, city, from, 1521, to, 1524, cort, s, personally, governed, mexico, many, historical, sources, have, conveyed, an, impression, that, cort, s, was, unjustly, treated, by, the, spanish, crown, and, that, he, received, nothing, but, ingratitude, for, his, role, in, establishing, new, spain, this, picture, is, the, one, cort, s, presents, in, his, letters, and, in, the, later, biography, written, by, francisco, l, pez, de, g, mara, however, there, may, be, more, to, the, picture, than, this, cort, s, s, own, sense, of, accomplishment, entitlement, and, vanity, may, have, played, a, part, in, his, deteriorating, position, with, the, king, cort, s, personally, was, not, ungenerously, rewarded, but, he, speedily, complained, of, insufficient, compensation, to, himself, and, his, comrades, thinking, himself, beyond, reach, of, restraint, he, disobeyed, many, of, the, orders, of, the, crown, and, what, was, more, imprudent, said, so, in, a, letter, to, the, emperor, dated, october, 15, 1524, ycazbalceta, documentos, para, la, historia, de, m, xico, mexico, 1858, i, in, this, letter, cort, s, besides, recalling, in, a, rather, abrupt, manner, that, the, conquest, of, mexico, was, due, to, him, alone, deliberately, acknowledges, his, disobedience, in, terms, which, could, not, fail, to, create, a, most, unfavourable, impression, king, charles, appointed, cort, s, as, governor, captain, general, and, chief, justice, of, the, newly, conquered, territory, dubbed, new, spain, of, the, ocean, sea, but, also, much, to, the, dismay, of, cort, s, four, royal, officials, were, appointed, at, the, same, time, to, assist, him, in, his, governing, in, effect, submitting, him, to, close, observation, and, administration, cort, s, initiated, the, construction, of, mexico, city, destroying, aztec, temples, and, buildings, and, then, rebuilding, on, the, aztec, ruins, what, soon, became, the, most, important, european, city, in, the, americas, cort, s, managed, the, founding, of, new, cities, and, appointed, men, to, extend, spanish, rule, to, all, of, new, spain, imposing, the, encomienda, system, in, 1524, he, reserved, many, encomiendas, for, himself, and, for, his, retinue, which, they, considered, just, rewards, for, their, accomplishment, in, conquering, central, mexico, however, later, arrivals, and, members, of, factions, antipathetic, to, cort, s, complained, of, the, favoritism, that, excluded, them, in, 1523, the, crown, possibly, influenced, by, cort, s, s, enemy, bishop, fonseca, sent, a, military, force, under, the, command, of, francisco, de, garay, to, conquer, and, settle, the, northern, part, of, mexico, the, region, of, p, nuco, this, was, another, setback, for, cort, s, who, mentioned, this, in, his, fourth, letter, to, the, king, in, which, he, describes, himself, as, the, victim, of, a, conspiracy, by, his, archenemies, diego, vel, zquez, de, cu, llar, diego, columbus, and, bishop, fonseca, as, well, as, francisco, garay, the, influence, of, garay, was, effectively, stopped, by, this, appeal, to, the, king, who, sent, out, a, decree, forbidding, garay, to, interfere, in, the, politics, of, new, spain, causing, him, to, give, up, without, a, fight, although, cort, s, had, flouted, the, authority, of, diego, vel, zquez, in, sailing, to, the, mainland, and, then, leading, an, expedition, of, conquest, cort, s, s, spectacular, success, was, rewarded, by, the, crown, with, a, coat, of, arms, a, mark, of, high, honor, following, the, conqueror, s, request, the, document, granting, the, coat, of, arms, summarizes, cort, s, s, accomplishments, in, the, conquest, of, mexico, the, proclamation, of, the, king, says, in, part, we, respecting, the, many, labors, dangers, and, adventures, which, you, underwent, as, stated, above, and, so, that, there, might, remain, a, perpetual, memorial, of, you, and, your, services, and, that, you, and, your, descendants, might, be, more, fully, honored, it, is, our, will, that, besides, your, coat, of, arms, of, your, lineage, which, you, have, you, may, have, and, bear, as, your, coat, of, arms, known, and, recognized, a, shield, 43, the, grant, specifies, the, iconography, of, the, coat, of, arms, the, central, portion, divided, into, quadrants, in, the, upper, portion, there, is, a, black, eagle, with, two, heads, on, a, white, field, which, are, the, arms, of, the, empire, 43, below, that, is, a, golden, lion, on, a, red, field, in, memory, of, the, fact, that, you, the, said, hernando, cort, s, by, your, industry, and, effort, brought, matters, to, the, state, described, above, i, e, the, conquest, 43, the, specificity, of, the, other, two, quadrants, is, linked, directly, to, mexico, with, one, quadrant, showing, three, crowns, representing, the, three, aztec, emperors, of, the, conquest, era, moctezuma, cuitlahuac, and, cuauhtemoc, 43, and, the, other, showing, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, 43, encircling, the, central, shield, are, symbols, of, the, seven, city, states, around, the, lake, and, their, lords, that, cort, s, defeated, with, the, lords, to, be, shown, as, prisoners, bound, with, a, chain, which, shall, be, closed, with, a, lock, beneath, the, shield, 44, 45, cort, s, s, wife, catalina, s, arez, arrived, in, new, spain, around, summer, 1522, along, with, her, sister, and, brother, his, marriage, to, catalina, was, at, this, point, extremely, awkward, since, she, was, a, kinswoman, of, the, governor, of, cuba, diego, vel, zquez, whose, authority, cort, s, had, thrown, off, and, who, was, therefore, now, his, enemy, catalina, lacked, the, noble, title, of, do, a, so, at, this, point, his, marriage, with, her, no, longer, raised, his, status, their, marriage, had, been, childless, since, cort, s, had, sired, children, with, a, variety, of, indigenous, women, including, a, son, around, 1522, by, his, cultural, translator, do, a, marina, cort, s, knew, he, was, capable, of, fathering, children, cort, s, s, only, male, heir, at, this, point, was, illegitimate, but, nonetheless, named, after, cort, s, s, father, mart, n, cort, s, this, son, mart, n, cort, s, was, also, popularly, called, el, mestizo, catalina, su, rez, died, under, mysterious, circumstances, the, night, of, november, 1, 2, 1522, there, were, accusations, at, the, time, that, cort, s, had, murdered, his, wife, there, was, an, investigation, into, her, death, interviewing, a, variety, of, household, residents, and, others, the, documentation, of, the, investigation, was, published, in, the, nineteenth, century, in, mexico, and, these, archival, documents, were, uncovered, in, the, twentieth, century, the, death, of, catalina, su, rez, produced, a, scandal, and, investigation, but, cort, s, was, now, free, to, marry, someone, of, high, status, more, appropriate, to, his, wealth, and, power, in, 1526, he, built, an, imposing, residence, for, himself, the, palace, of, cort, s, in, cuernavaca, in, a, region, close, to, the, capital, where, he, had, extensive, encomienda, holdings, in, 1529, he, had, been, accorded, the, noble, designation, of, don, but, more, importantly, was, given, the, noble, title, of, marquess, of, the, valley, of, oaxaca, and, married, the, spanish, noblewoman, do, a, juana, de, z, iga, the, marriage, produced, three, children, including, another, son, who, was, also, named, mart, n, as, the, first, born, legitimate, son, don, mart, n, cort, s, y, z, iga, was, now, cort, s, s, heir, and, succeeded, him, as, holder, of, the, title, and, estate, of, the, marquessate, of, the, valley, of, oaxaca, cort, s, s, legitimate, daughters, were, do, a, maria, do, a, catalina, and, do, a, juana, since, the, conversion, to, christianity, of, indigenous, peoples, was, an, essential, and, integral, part, of, the, extension, of, spanish, power, making, formal, provisions, for, that, conversion, once, the, military, conquest, was, completed, was, an, important, task, for, cort, s, during, the, age, of, discovery, the, catholic, church, had, seen, early, attempts, at, conversion, in, the, caribbean, islands, by, spanish, friars, particularly, the, mendicant, orders, cort, s, made, a, request, to, the, spanish, monarch, to, send, franciscan, and, dominican, friars, to, mexico, to, convert, the, vast, indigenous, populations, to, christianity, in, his, fourth, letter, to, the, king, cort, s, pleaded, for, friars, rather, than, diocesan, or, secular, priests, because, those, clerics, were, in, his, view, a, serious, danger, to, the, indians, conversion, if, these, people, were, now, to, see, the, affairs, of, the, church, and, the, service, of, god, in, the, hands, of, canons, or, other, dignitaries, and, saw, them, indulge, in, the, vices, and, profanities, now, common, in, spain, knowing, that, such, men, were, the, ministers, of, god, it, would, bring, our, faith, into, much, harm, that, i, believe, any, further, preaching, would, be, of, no, avail, he, wished, the, mendicants, to, be, the, main, evangelists, mendicant, friars, did, not, usually, have, full, priestly, powers, to, perform, all, the, sacraments, needed, for, conversion, of, the, indians, and, growth, of, the, neophytes, in, the, christian, faith, so, cort, s, laid, out, a, solution, to, this, to, the, king, your, majesty, should, likewise, beseech, his, holiness, to, grant, these, powers, to, the, two, principal, persons, in, the, religious, orders, that, are, to, come, here, and, that, they, should, be, his, delegates, one, from, the, order, of, st, francis, and, the, other, from, the, order, of, st, dominic, they, should, bring, the, most, extensive, powers, your, majesty, is, able, to, obtain, for, because, these, lands, are, so, far, from, the, church, of, rome, and, we, the, christians, who, now, reside, here, and, shall, do, so, in, the, future, are, so, far, from, the, proper, remedies, of, our, consciences, and, as, we, are, human, so, subject, to, sin, it, is, essential, that, his, holiness, should, be, generous, with, us, and, grant, to, these, persons, most, extensive, powers, to, be, handed, down, to, persons, actually, in, residence, here, whether, it, be, given, to, the, general, of, each, order, or, to, his, provincials, the, franciscans, arrived, in, may, 1524, a, symbolically, powerful, group, of, twelve, known, as, the, twelve, apostles, of, mexico, led, by, fray, mart, n, de, valencia, franciscan, geronimo, de, mendieta, claimed, that, cort, s, s, most, important, deed, was, the, way, he, met, this, first, group, of, franciscans, the, conqueror, himself, was, said, to, have, met, the, friars, as, they, approached, the, capital, kneeling, at, the, feet, of, the, friars, who, had, walked, from, the, coast, this, story, was, told, by, franciscans, to, demonstrate, cort, s, piety, and, humility, and, was, a, powerful, message, to, all, including, the, indians, that, cort, s, s, earthly, power, was, subordinate, to, the, spiritual, power, of, the, friars, however, one, of, the, first, twelve, franciscans, fray, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, does, not, mention, it, in, his, history, cort, s, and, the, franciscans, had, a, particularly, strong, alliance, in, mexico, with, franciscans, seeing, him, as, the, new, moses, for, conquering, mexico, and, opening, it, to, christian, evangelization, in, motolinia, s, 1555, response, to, dominican, bartolom, de, las, casas, he, praises, cort, s, and, as, to, those, who, murmur, against, the, marqu, s, del, valle, god, rest, him, and, who, try, to, blacken, and, obscure, his, deeds, i, believe, that, before, god, their, deeds, are, not, as, acceptable, as, those, of, the, marqu, s, although, as, a, human, he, was, a, sinner, he, had, faith, and, works, of, a, good, christian, and, a, great, desire, to, employ, his, life, and, property, in, widening, and, augmenting, the, fair, of, jesus, christ, and, dying, for, the, conversion, of, these, gentiles, who, has, loved, and, defended, the, indians, of, this, new, world, like, cort, s, through, this, captain, god, opened, the, door, for, us, to, preach, his, holy, gospel, and, it, was, he, who, caused, the, indians, to, revere, the, holy, sacraments, and, respect, the, ministers, of, the, church, in, fray,

appear, in, the, earlier, text, from, the, indigenous, perspective, whereas, book, xii, of, the, florentine, codex, concludes, with, an, account, of, spaniards, search, for, gold, in, sahag, n, s, 1585, revised, account, he, ends, with, praise, of, cort, s, for, requesting, the, franciscans, be, sent, to, mexico, to, convert, the, indians, from, 1524, to, 1526, cort, s, headed, an, expedition, to, honduras, where, he, defeated, crist, bal, de, olid, who, had, claimed, honduras, as, his, own, under, the, influence, of, the, governor, of, cuba, diego, vel, zquez, fearing, that, cuauht, moc, might, head, an, insurrection, in, mexico, he, brought, him, with, him, to, honduras, in, a, controversial, move, cuauht, moc, was, executed, during, the, journey, raging, over, olid, s, treason, cort, s, issued, a, decree, to, arrest, vel, zquez, whom, he, was, sure, was, behind, olid, s, treason, this, however, only, served, to, further, estrange, the, crown, of, castile, and, the, council, of, indies, both, of, which, were, already, beginning, to, feel, anxious, about, cort, s, s, rising, power, cort, s, s, fifth, letter, to, king, charles, attempts, to, justify, his, conduct,

time, for, distant, colonies, much, of, charles, s, reign, was, taken, up, with, wars, with, france, the, german, protestants, and, the, expanding, ottoman, empire, except, insofar, as, they, contributed, to, finance, his, wars, in, 1521, year, of, the, conquest, charles, was, attending, to, matters, in, his, german, domains, and, bishop, adrian, of, utrecht, functioned, as, regent, in,

arrest, him, cort, s, was, once, quoted, as, saying, that, it, was, more, difficult, to, contend, against, own, countrymen, than, against, the, aztecs, governor, diego, vel, zquez, continued, to, be, a, thorn, in, his, side, teaming, up, with, bishop, juan, rodr, guez, de, fonseca, chief, of, the, spanish, colonial, department, to, undermine, him, in, the, council, of, the, indies, a, few, days, after, cort, s, s, return, from, his, expedition, ponce, de, le, n, suspended, cort, s, from, his, office, of, governor, of, new, spain, the, licentiate, then, fell, ill, and, died, shortly, after, his, arrival, appointing, marcos, de, aguilar, as, alcalde, mayor, the, aged, aguilar, also, became, sick, and, appointed, alonso, de, estrada, governor, who, was, confirmed, in, his, functions, by, a, royal, decree, in, august, 1527, cort, s, suspected, of, poisoning, them, refrained, from, taking, over, the, government, estrada, sent, diego, de, figueroa, to, the, south, de, figueroa, raided, graveyards, and, extorted, contributions, meeting, his, end, when, the, ship, carrying, these, treasures, sank, albornoz, persuaded, alonso, de, estrada, to, release, gonzalo, de, salazar, and, chirinos, when, cort, s, complained, angrily, after, one, of, his, adherents, hands, was, cut, off, estrada, ordered, him, exiled, cort, s, sailed, for, spain, in, 1528, to, appeal, to, king, charles,

representatives, during, his, absence, cort, s, presented, himself, with, great, splendor, before, charles, v, s, court, by, this, time, charles, had, returned, and, cort, s, forthrightly, responded, to, his, enemy, s, charges, denying, he, had, held, back, on, gold, due, the, crown, he, showed, that, he, had, contributed, more, than, the, quinto, one, fifth, required, indeed, he, had, spent, lavishly, to, build, the, new, capital, of, mexico, city, on, the, ruins, of, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitl, n, leveled, during, the, siege, that, brought, down, the, aztec, empire, he, was, received, by, charles, with, every, distinction, and, decorated, with, the, order, of, santiago, in, return, for, his, efforts, in, expanding, the, still, young, spanish, empire, cort, s, was, rewarded, in, 1529, by, being, accorded, the, noble, title, of, don, but, more, importantly, named, the, marqu, s, del, valle, de, oaxaca, marquess, of, the, valley, of, oaxaca, and, married, the, spanish, noblewoman, do, a, juana, z, iga, after, the, 1522, death, of, his, much, less, distinguished, first, wife, catalina, su, rez, the, noble, title, and, senorial, estate, of, the, marquesado, was, passed, down, to, his, descendants, until, 1811, the, oaxaca, valley, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, regions, of, new, spain, and, cort, s, had, 23, 000, vassals, in, 23, named, encomiendas, in, perpetuity, although, confirmed, in, his, land, holdings, and, vassals, he, was, not, reinstated, as, governor, and, was, never, again, given, any, important, office, in, the, administration, of, new,

s, family, through, the, generations, cort, s, returned, to, mexico, in, 1530, with, new, titles, and, honors, although, cort, s, still, retained, military, authority, and, permission, to, continue, his, conquests, don, antonio, de, mendoza, was, appointed, in, 1535, as, a, viceroy, to, administer, new, spain, s, civil, affairs, this, division, of, power, led, to, continual, dissension, and, caused, the, failure, of, several, enterprises, in, which, cort, s, was, engaged, on, returning, to, mexico, cort, s, found, the, country, in, a, state, of, anarchy, there, was, a, strong, suspicion, in, court, circles, of, an, intended, rebellion, by, cort, s, after, reasserting, his, position, and, reestablishing, some, sort, of, order, cort, s, retired, to, his, estates, at, cuernavaca, about, 30, miles, 48, km, south, of, mexico, city, there, he, concentrated, on, the, building, of, his, palace, and, on, pacific, exploration, remaining, in, mexico, between, 1530, and, 1541, cort, s, quarreled, with, nu, o, beltr, n, de, guzm, n, and, disputed, the, right, to, explore, the, territory, that, is, today, california, with, antonio, de, mendoza, the, first, viceroy, cort, s, acquired, several, silver, mines, in, zumpango, del, rio, in, 1534, by, the, early, 1540s, he, owned, 20, silver, mines, in, sultepec, 12, in, taxco, and, 3, in, zacualpan, earlier, cort, s, had, claimed, the, silver, in, the, tamazula, area, in, 1536, cort, s, explored, the, northwestern, part, of, mexico, and, discovered, the, baja, california, peninsula, cort, s, also, spent, time, exploring, the, pacific, coast, of, mexico, the, gulf, of, california, was, originally, named, the, sea, of, cort, s, by, its, discoverer, francisco, de, ulloa, in, 1539, this, was, the, last, major, expedition, by, cort, s, after, his, exploration, of, baja, california, cort, s, returned, to, spain, in, 1541, hoping, to, confound, his, angry, civilians, who, had, brought, many, lawsuits, against, him, for, debts, abuse, of, power, etc, on, his, return, he, went, through, a, crowd, to, speak, to, the, emperor, who, demanded, of, him, who, he, was, i, am, a, man, replied, cort, s, who, has, given, you, more, provinces, than, your, ancestors, left, you, cities, the, emperor, finally, permitted, cort, s, to, join, him, and, his, fleet, commanded, by, andrea, doria, at, the, great, expedition, against, algiers, in, the, barbary, coast, in, 1541, which, was, then, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, during, this, campaign, cort, s, was, almost, drowned, in, a, storm, that, hit, his, fleet, while, he, was, pursuing, the, pasha, of, algiers, having, spent, a, great, deal, of, his, own, money, to, finance, expeditions, he, was, now, heavily, in, debt, in, february, 1544, he, made, a, claim, on, the, royal, treasury, but, was, ignored, for, the, next, three, years, disgusted, he, decided, to, return, to, mexico, in, 1547, when, he, reached, seville, he, was, stricken, with, dysentery, he, died, in, castilleja, de, la, cuesta, seville, province, on, december, 2, 1547, from, a, case, of, pleurisy, at, the, age, of, 62, he, left, his, many, mestizo, and, white, children, well, cared, for, in, his, will, along, with, every, one, of, their, mothers, he, requested, in, his, will, that, his, remains, eventually, be, buried, in, mexico, before, he, died, he, had, the, pope, remove, the, natural, status, of, four, of, his, children, legitimizing, them, in, the, eyes, of, the, church, including, mart, n, the, son, he, had, with, do, a, marina, also, known, as, la, malinche, said, to, be, his, favourite, his, daughter, do, a, catalina, however, died, shortly, after, her, father, s, death, after, his, death, his, body, was, moved, more, than, eight, times, for, several, reasons, on, december, 4, 1547, he, was, buried, in, the, mausoleum, of, the, duke, of, medina, in, the, church, of, san, isidoro, del, campo, sevilla, three, years, later, 1550, due, to, the, space, being, required, by, the, duke, his, body, was, moved, to, the, altar, of, santa, catarina, in, the, same, church, in, his, testament, cort, s, asked, for, his, body, to, be, buried, in, the, monastery, he, had, ordered, to, be, built, in, coyoacan, in, m, xico, ten, years, after, his, death, but, the, monastery, was, never, built, so, in, 1566, his, body, was, sent, to, new, spain, and, buried, in, the, church, of, san, francisco, de, texcoco, where, his, mother, and, one, of, his, sisters, were, buried, in, 1629, cortes, s, last, male, descendant, don, pedro, cort, s, fourth, marquez, del, valle, died, the, viceroy, decided, to, move, the, bones, of, cort, s, along, with, those, of, his, descendant, to, the, franciscan, church, in, m, xico, this, was, delayed, for, nine, years, while, his, body, stayed, in, the, main, room, of, the, palace, of, the, viceroy, eventually, it, was, moved, to, the, sagrario, of, franciscan, church, where, it, stayed, for, 87, years, in, 1716, it, was, moved, to, another, place, in, the, same, church, in, 1794, his, bones, were, moved, to, the, hospital, de, jesus, founded, by, cort, s, where, a, statue, by, tols, and, a, mausoleum, were, made, there, was, a, public, ceremony, and, all, the, churches, in, the, city, rang, their, bells, in, 1823, after, the, independence, of, m, xico, it, seemed, imminent, that, his, body, would, be, desecrated, so, the, mausoleum, was, removed, the, statue, and, the, coat, of, arms, were, sent, to, palermo, sicily, to, be, protected, by, the, duke, of, terranova, the, bones, were, hidden, and, everyone, thought, that, they, had, been, sent, out, of, m, xico, in, 1836, his, bones, were, moved, to, another, place, in, the, same, building, it, was, not, until, november, 24, 1946, that, they, were, rediscovered, 467, thanks, to, the, discovery, of, a, secret, document, by, lucas, alam, n, his, bones, were, put, in, the, charge, of, the, instituto, nacional, de, antropolog, a, e, historia, inah, the, remains, were, authenticated, by, inah, 468, they, were, then, restored, to, the, same, place, this, time, with, a, bronze, inscription, and, his, coat, of, arms, when, the, bones, were, first, rediscovered, the, supporters, of, the, hispanic, tradition, in, mexico, were, excited, but, one, supporter, of, an, indigenist, vision, of, mexico, proposed, that, the, remains, be, publicly, burned, in, front, of, the, statue, of, cuauhtemoc, and, the, ashes, flung, into, the, air, 468, following, the, discovery, and, authentication, of, cort, s, s, remains, there, was, a, discovery, of, what, were, described, as, the, bones, of, cuauht, moc, resulting, in, a, battle, of, the, bones, 468, on, december, 16, 1560, the, lawsuits, related, to, vassals, of, the, cortes, estate, were, resolved, by, a, royal, order, issued, by, philip, ii, cort, s, is, commemorated, in, the, scientific, name, of, a, subspecies, of, mexican, lizard, phrynosoma, orbiculare, cortezii, there, are, relatively, few, sources, to, the, early, life, of, cort, s, his, fame, arose, from, his, participation, in, the, conquest, of, mexico, and, it, was, only, after, this, that, people, became, interested, in, reading, and, writing, about, him, probably, the, best, source, is, his, letters, to, the, king, which, he, wrote, during, the, campaign, in, mexico, but, they, are, written, with, the, specific, purpose, of, putting, his, efforts, in, a, favourable, light, and, so, must, be, read, critically, another, main, source, is, the, biography, written, by, cort, s, s, private, chaplain, lopez, de, g, mara, which, was, written, in, spain, several, years, after, the, conquest, g, mara, never, set, foot, in, the, americas, and, knew, only, what, cort, s, had, told, him, and, he, had, an, affinity, for, knightly, romantic, stories, which, he, incorporated, richly, in, the, biography, the, third, major, source, is, written, as, a, reaction, to, what, its, author, calls, the, lies, of, gomara, the, eyewitness, account, written, by, the, conquistador, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, which, does, not, paint, cort, s, as, a, romantic, hero, but, rather, tries, to, emphasize, that, cort, s, s, men, should, also, be, remembered, as, important, participants, in, the, undertakings, in, mexico, in, the, years, following, the, conquest, more, critical, accounts, of, the, spanish, arrival, in, mexico, were, written, the, dominican, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, wrote, his, a, short, account, of, the, destruction, of, the, indies, which, raises, strong, accusations, of, brutality, and, heinous, violence, towards, the, indians, accusations, against, both, the, conquistadors, in, general, and, cort, s, in, particular, the, accounts, of, the, conquest, given, in, the, florentine, codex, by, the, franciscan, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, his, native, informants, are, also, less, than, flattering, towards, cort, s, the, scarcity, of, these, sources, has, led, to, a, sharp, division, in, the, description, of, cort, s, s, personality, and, a, tendency, to, describe, him, as, either, a, vicious, and, ruthless, person, or, a, noble, and, honorable, cavalier, in, m, xico, there, are, few, representations, of, cort, s, however, many, landmarks, still, bear, his, name, from, the, castle, palacio, de, cort, s, in, the, city, of, cuernavaca, to, some, street, names, throughout, the, republic, the, pass, between, the, volcanoes, iztacc, huatl, and, popocat, petl, where, cort, s, took, his, soldiers, on, their, march, to, mexico, city, it, is, known, as, the, paso, de, cort, s, the, muralist, diego, rivera, painted, several, representation, of, him, but, the, most, famous, depicts, him, as, a, powerful, and, ominous, figure, along, with, malinche, in, a, mural, in, the, national, palace, in, mexico, city, in, 1981, president, lopez, portillo, tried, to, bring, cort, s, to, public, recognition, first, he, made, public, a, copy, of, the, bust, of, cort, s, made, by, manuel, tols, in, the, hospital, de, jes, s, nazareno, with, an, official, ceremony, but, soon, a, nationalist, group, tried, to, destroy, it, so, it, had, to, be, taken, out, of, the, public, today, the, copy, of, the, bust, is, in, the, hospital, de, jes, s, nazareno, while, the, original, is, in, naples, italy, in, the, villa, pignatelli, later, another, monument, known, as, monumento, al, mestizaje, by, juli, n, mart, nez, y, m, maldonado, 1982, was, commissioned, by, mexican, president, jos, l, pez, portillo, to, be, put, in, the, z, calo, main, square, of, coyoacan, near, the, place, of, his, country, house, but, it, had, to, be, removed, to, a, little, known, park, the, jard, n, xicot, ncatl, barrio, de, san, diego, churubusco, to, quell, protests, the, statue, depicts, cort, s, malinche, and, their, son, mart, n, there, is, another, statue, by, sebasti, n, aparicio, in, cuernavaca, was, in, a, hotel, el, casino, de, la, selva, cort, s, is, barely, recognizable, so, it, sparked, little, interest, the, hotel, was, closed, to, make, a, commercial, center, and, the, statue, was, put, out, of, public, display, by, costco, the, builder, of, the,
