scenes, he, was, buried, in, his, hometown, of, ferrara, on, 2, august, 2007, it, s, too, simplistic, to, say, as, many, people, have, done, that, i, am, condemning, the, inhuman, industrial, world, which, oppresses, the, individuals, and, leads, them, to, neurosis, my, intention, was, to, translate, the, poetry, of, the, world, in, which, even, factories, can, be, beautiful, the, line, and, curves, of, factories, and, their, chimneys, can, be, more, beautiful, than, the, outline, of, trees, which, we, are, already, too, accustomed, to, seeing, it, is, a, rich, world, alive, and, serviceable, there, are, people, who, do, adapt, and, others, who, can, t, manage, perhaps, because, they, are, too, tied, to, ways, of, life, that, are, by, now, out, of, date, antonioni, interviewed, about, red, desert, 1964, critic, richard, brody, described, antonioni, as, the, cinema, s, exemplary, modernist, and, one, of, its, great, pictorialists, his, images, reflect, with, a, cold, enticement, the, abstractions, that, fascinated, him, allmovie, stated, that, his, films, a, seminal, body, of, enigmatic, and, intricate, mood, pieces, rejected, action, in, favor, of, contemplation, championing, image, and, design, over, character, and, story, stephen, dalton, of, the, british, film, institute, described, antonioni, s, influential, visual, hallmarks, as, extremely, long, takes, striking, modern, architecture, painterly, use, of, colour, tiny, human, figures, adrift, in, empty, landscapes, noting, similarities, to, the, empty, urban, dreamscapes, of, surrealist, painter, giorgio, de, chirico, film, historian, virginia, wright, wexman, notes, the, slowness, of, his, camera, and, the, absence, of, frequent, cuts, stating, that, he, forces, our, full, attention, by, continuing, the, shot, long, after, others, would, cut, away, antonioni, is, also, noted, for, exploiting, colour, as, a, significant, expressive, element, in, his, later, works, especially, in, il, deserto, rosso, his, first, colour, film, antonioni, s, plots, were, experimental, ambiguous, and, elusive, often, featuring, middle, class, characters, who, suffer, from, ennui, desperation, or, joyless, sex, film, historian, david, bordwell, writes, that, in, antonioni, s, films, vacations, parties, and, artistic, pursuits, are, vain, efforts, to, conceal, the, characters, lack, of, purpose, and, emotion, sexuality, is, reduced, to, casual, seduction, enterprise, to, the, pursuit, of, wealth, at, any, cost, the, new, yorker, wrote, that, antonioni, captured, a, new, bourgeois, society, that, shifted, from, physical, to, intellectual, creation, from, matter, to, abstraction, from, things, to, images, and, the, crisis, of, personal, identity, and, self, recognition, that, resulted, calling, his, 1960s, collaborations, with, monica, vitti, a, crucial, moment, in, the, creation, of, cinematic, modernism, richard, brody, stated, that, his, films, explore, the, way, that, new, methods, of, communication, mainly, the, mass, media, but, also, the, abstractions, of, high, tech, industry, architecture, music, politics, and, even, fashion, have, a, feedback, effect, on, the, educated, white, collar, thinkers, who, create, them, but, noted, that, he, wasn, t, nostalgic, about, the, premodern, wexman, describes, antonioni, s, perspective, on, the, world, as, that, of, a, postreligious, marxist, and, existentialist, intellectual, in, a, speech, at, cannes, about, l, avventura, antonioni, said, that, in, the, modern, age, of, reason, and, science, mankind, still, lives, by, a, rigid, and, stereotyped, morality, which, all, of, us, recognize, as, such, and, yet, sustain, out, of, cowardice, and, sheer, laziness, we, have, examined, those, moral, attitudes, very, carefully, we, have, dissected, them, and, analyzed, them, to, the, point, of, exhaustion, we, have, been, capable, of, all, this, but, we, have, not, been, capable, of, finding, new, ones, nine, years, later, he, expressed, a, similar, attitude, in, an, interview, saying, that, he, loathed, the, word, morality, when, man, becomes, reconciled, to, nature, when, space, becomes, his, true, background, these, words, and, concepts, will, have, lost, their, meaning, and, we, will, no, longer, have, to, use, them, critic, roland, barthes, claimed, that, antonioni, s, approach, is, not, that, of, a, historian, a, politician, or, a, moralist, but, rather, that, of, a, utopian, whose, perception, is, seeking, to, pinpoint, the, new, world, because, he, is, eager, for, this, world, and, already, wants, to, be, part, of, it, he, added, that, his, art, consists, in, always, leaving, the, road, of, meaning, open, and, as, if, undecided, bordwell, explains, that, antonioni, was, extremely, influential, on, art, films, more, than, any, other, director, he, encouraged, filmmakers, to, explore, elliptical, and, open, ended, narrative, the, guardian, described, him, as, in, essence, a, director, of, extraordinary, sequences, and, advised, viewers, to, forget, plotting, characters, or, dialogue, his, import, is, conveyed, in, absolutely, formal, terms, film, director, akira, kurosawa, considered, antonioni, one, of, the, most, interesting, filmmakers, stanley, kubrick, listed, la, notte, as, one, of, his, ten, favorite, films, in, a, 1963, poll, andrei, tarkovsky, was, deeply, influenced, by, antonioni, especially, for, the, development, of, his, film, nostalghia, in, an, interview, with, serge, kaganski, in, 2004, jean, luc, godard, judges, that, antonioni, is, the, filmmaker, who, has, most, influenced, contemporary, cinema, wim, wenders, considered, antonioni, as, a, master, and, the, two, collaborated, as, directors, for, the, film, beyond, the, clouds, mikl, s, jancs, considers, antonioni, as, his, master, american, director, martin, scorsese, paid, tribute, to, antonioni, following, his, death, in, 2007, stating, that, his, films, posed, mysteries, or, rather, the, mystery, of, who, we, are, what, we, are, to, each, other, to, ourselves, to, time, you, could, say, that, antonioni, was, looking, directly, at, the, mysteries, of, the, soul, american, directors, francis, ford, coppola, and, brian, de, palma, paid, homage, to, antonioni, in, their, own, films, antonioni, s, spare, style, and, purposeless, characters, however, have, not, received, universal, acclaim, ingmar, bergman, stated, in, 2002, that, while, he, considered, the, antonioni, films, blowup, and, la, notte, masterpieces, he, found, the, other, films, boring, and, noted, that, he, had, never, understood, why, antonioni, was, held, in, such, esteem, orson, welles, regretted, the, italian, director, s, use, of, the, long, take, i, don, t, like, to, dwell, on, things, it, s, one, of, the, reasons, i, m, so, bored, with, antonioni, the, belief, that, because, a, shot, is, good, it, s, going, to, get, better, if, you, keep, looking, at, it, he, gives, you, a, full, shot, of, somebody, walking, down, a, road, and, you, think, well, he, s, not, going, to, carry, that, woman, all, the, way, up, that, road, but, he, does, and, then, she, leaves, and, you, go, on, looking, at, the, road, after, she, s, gone, american, actor, peter, weller, whom, antonioni, directed, in, beyond, the, clouds, explained, in, a, 1996, interview, there, is, no, director, living, except, maybe, kurosawa, bergman, or, antonioni, that, i, would, fall, down, and, do, anything, for, i, met, antonioni, three, years, ago, in, taormina, at, a, film, festival, i, introduced, myself, and, told, him, that, i, adored, his, movies, his, contributions, to, film, because, he, was, the, first, guy, who, really, started, making, films, about, the, reality, of, the, vacuity, between, people, the, difficulty, in, traversing, this, space, between, lovers, in, modern, day, and, he, never, gives, you, an, answer, antonioni, that, s, the, beautiful, thing
