plato, p, l, e, t, o, play, toe, greek, born, aristocles, c, 427, 348, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, philosopher, of, the, classical, period, who, is, considered, a, foundational, thinker, in, western, philosophy, and, an, innovator, of, the, written, dialogue, and, dialectic, forms, he, raised, problems, for, what, became, all, the, major, areas, of, both, theoretical, philosophy, and, practical, philosophy, and, was, the, founder, of, the, platonic, academy, a, philosophical, school, in, athens, where, plato, taught, the, doctrines, that, would, later, become, known, as, platonism, plato, s, most, famous, contribution, is, the, theory, of, forms, or, ideas, which, has, been, interpreted, as, advancing, a, solution, to, what, is, now, known, as, the, problem, of, universals, he, was, decisively, influenced, by, the, pre, socratic, thinkers, pythagoras, heraclitus, and, parmenides, although, much, of, what, is, known, about, them, is, derived, from, plato, himself, along, with, his, teacher, socrates, and, aristotle, his, student, plato, is, a, central, figure, in, the, history, of, philosophy, plato, s, entire, body, of, work, is, believed, to, have, survived, intact, for, over, 2, 400, years, unlike, that, of, nearly, all, of, his, contemporaries, although, their, popularity, has, fluctuated, they, have, consistently, been, read, and, studied, through, the, ages, through, neoplatonism, he, also, greatly, influenced, both, christian, and, islamic, philosophy, in, modern, times, alfred, north, whitehead, famously, said, the, safest, general, characterization, of, the, european, philosophical, tradition, is, that, it, consists, of, a, series, of, footnotes, to, plato, plato, greek, pl, t, n, from, ancient, greek, romanized, platys, lit, broad, is, actually, a, nickname, although, it, is, a, fact, that, the, philosopher, called, himself, platon, in, his, maturity, the, origin, of, this, name, remains, mysterious, platon, was, a, fairly, common, name, 31, instances, are, known, from, athens, alone, but, the, name, does, not, occur, in, plato, s, known, family, line, the, sources, of, diogenes, laertius, account, for, this, by, claiming, his, wrestling, coach, ariston, of, argos, dubbed, him, broad, on, account, of, his, chest, and, shoulders, or, that, plato, derived, his, name, from, the, breadth, of, his, eloquence, or, his, wide, forehead, philodemus, in, extracts, from, the, herculaneum, papyri, corroborates, the, claim, that, plato, was, named, for, his, broad, forehead, while, recalling, a, moral, lesson, about, frugal, living, seneca, mentions, the, meaning, of, plato, s, name, his, very, name, was, given, him, because, of, his, broad, chest, according, to, diogenes, laertius, his, birth, name, was, aristocles, meaning, best, reputation, plato, whose, actual, name, was, aristocles, was, born, in, athens, or, aegina, between, 428, and, 423, bc, he, was, a, member, of, an, aristocratic, and, influential, family, his, father, was, ariston, who, may, have, been, a, descendant, of, two, kings, codrus, and, melanthus, his, mother, was, perictione, descendant, of, solon, a, statesman, credited, with, laying, the, foundations, of, athenian, democracy, plato, had, two, brothers, glaucon, and, adeimantus, a, sister, potone, and, a, half, brother, antiphon, plato, may, have, travelled, to, italy, sicily, egypt, and, cyrene, at, 40, he, founded, a, school, of, philosophy, the, academy, it, was, located, in, athens, on, a, plot, of, land, in, the, grove, of, hecademus, or, academus, named, after, an, attic, hero, in, greek, mythology, the, academy, operated, until, it, was, destroyed, by, sulla, in, 84, bc, many, philosophers, studied, at, the, academy, the, most, prominent, being, aristotle, according, to, diogenes, laertius, throughout, his, later, life, plato, became, entangled, with, the, politics, of, the, city, of, syracuse, where, he, attempted, to, replace, the, tyrant, dionysius, with, dionysius, s, brother, in, law, dion, of, syracuse, whom, plato, had, recruited, as, one, of, his, followers, but, the, tyrant, himself, turned, against, plato, plato, almost, faced, death, but, was, sold, into, slavery, anniceris, a, cyrenaic, philosopher, bought, plato, s, freedom, for, twenty, minas, and, sent, him, home, philodemus, however, states, that, plato, was, sold, as, a, slave, as, early, as, in, 404, bc, when, the, spartans, conquered, aegina, or, alternatively, in, 399, bc, immediately, after, the, death, of, socrates, after, dionysius, s, death, according, to, plato, s, seventh, letter, dion, requested, plato, return, to, syracuse, to, tutor, dionysius, ii, who, seemed, to, accept, plato, s, teachings, but, eventually, became, suspicious, of, their, motives, expelling, dion, and, holding, plato, against, his, will, eventually, plato, left, syracuse, and, dion, would, return, to, overthrow, dionysius, and, rule, syracuse, before, being, usurped, by, callippus, a, fellow, disciple, of, plato, a, variety, of, sources, have, given, accounts, of, plato, s, death, one, story, based, on, a, mutilated, manuscript, suggests, plato, died, in, his, bed, whilst, a, young, thracian, girl, played, the, flute, to, him, another, tradition, suggests, plato, died, at, a, wedding, feast, the, account, is, based, on, diogenes, laertius, s, reference, to, an, account, by, hermippus, a, third, century, alexandrian, according, to, tertullian, plato, simply, died, in, his, sleep, according, to, philodemus, plato, was, buried, in, the, garden, of, his, academy, in, athens, close, to, the, sacred, shrine, of, the, muses, plato, never, speaks, in, his, own, voice, in, his, dialogues, every, dialogue, except, the, laws, features, socrates, although, many, dialogues, including, the, timaeus, and, statesman, feature, him, speaking, only, rarely, leo, strauss, notes, that, socrates, reputation, for, irony, casts, doubt, on, whether, plato, s, socrates, is, expressing, sincere, beliefs, xenophon, s, memorabilia, and, aristophanes, s, the, clouds, seem, to, present, a, somewhat, different, portrait, of, socrates, from, the, one, plato, paints, aristotle, attributes, a, different, doctrine, with, respect, to, forms, to, plato, and, socrates, aristotle, suggests, that, socrates, idea, of, forms, can, be, discovered, through, investigation, of, the, natural, world, unlike, plato, s, forms, that, exist, beyond, and, outside, the, ordinary, range, of, human, understanding, the, socratic, problem, concerns, how, to, reconcile, these, various, accounts, the, precise, relationship, between, plato, and, socrates, remains, an, area, of, contention, among, scholars, although, socrates, influenced, plato, directly, the, influence, of, pythagoras, or, in, a, broader, sense, the, pythagoreans, such, as, archytas, also, appears, to, have, been, significant, aristotle, and, cicero, both, claimed, that, the, philosophy, of, plato, closely, followed, the, teachings, of, the, pythagoreans, according, to, r, m, hare, this, influence, consists, of, three, points, pythagoras, held, that, all, things, are, number, and, the, cosmos, comes, from, numerical, principles, he, introduced, the, concept, of, form, as, distinct, from, matter, and, that, the, physical, world, is, an, imitation, of, an, eternal, mathematical, world, these, ideas, were, very, influential, on, heraclitus, parmenides, and, plato, the, two, philosophers, heraclitus, and, parmenides, influenced, by, earlier, pre, socratic, greek, philosophers, such, as, pythagoras, and, xenophanes, departed, from, mythological, explanations, for, the, universe, and, began, the, metaphysical, tradition, that, strongly, influenced, plato, and, continues, today, heraclitus, viewed, all, things, as, continuously, changing, that, one, cannot, step, into, the, same, river, twice, due, to, the, ever, changing, waters, flowing, through, it, and, all, things, exist, as, a, contraposition, of, opposites, according, to, diogenes, laertius, plato, received, these, ideas, through, heraclitus, disciple, cratylus, parmenides, adopted, an, altogether, contrary, vision, arguing, for, the, idea, of, a, changeless, eternal, universe, and, the, view, that, change, is, an, illusion, plato, s, most, self, critical, dialogue, is, the, parmenides, which, features, parmenides, and, his, student, zeno, which, criticizes, plato, s, own, metaphysical, theories, plato, s, sophist, dialogue, includes, an, eleatic, stranger, these, ideas, about, change, and, permanence, or, becoming, and, being, influenced, plato, in, formulating, his, theory, of, forms, in, plato, s, dialogues, socrates, and, his, company, of, disputants, had, something, to, say, on, many, subjects, including, several, aspects, of, metaphysics, these, include, religion, and, science, human, nature, love, and, sexuality, more, than, one, dialogue, contrasts, perception, and, reality, nature, and, custom, and, body, and, soul, francis, cornford, identified, the, twin, pillars, of, platonism, as, the, theory, of, forms, on, the, one, hand, and, on, the, other, hand, the, doctrine, of, immortality, of, the, soul, in, the, dialogues, socrates, regularly, asks, for, the, meaning, of, a, general, term, e, g, justice, truth, beauty, and, criticizes, those, who, instead, give, him, particular, examples, rather, than, the, quality, shared, by, all, examples, platonism, and, its, theory, of, forms, also, known, as, theory, of, ideas, denies, the, reality, of, the, material, world, considering, it, only, an, image, or, copy, of, the, real, world, according, to, this, theory, of, forms, there, are, these, two, kinds, of, things, the, apparent, world, of, material, objects, grasped, by, the, senses, which, constantly, changes, and, an, unchanging, and, unseen, world, of, forms, grasped, by, reason, plato, s, forms, represent, types, of, things, as, well, as, properties, patterns, and, relations, which, are, referred, to, as, objects, just, as, individual, tables, chairs, and, cars, refer, to, objects, in, this, world, tableness, chairness, and, carness, as, well, as, e, g, justice, truth, and, beauty, refer, to, objects, in, another, world, one, of, plato, s, most, cited, examples, for, the, forms, were, the, truths, of, geometry, such, as, the, pythagorean, theorem, the, theory, of, forms, is, first, introduced, in, the, phaedo, dialogue, also, known, as, on, the, soul, wherein, socrates, disputes, the, pluralism, of, anaxagoras, then, the, most, popular, response, to, heraclitus, and, parmenides, for, plato, as, was, characteristic, of, ancient, greek, philosophy, the, soul, was, that, which, gave, life, plato, advocates, a, belief, in, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, several, dialogues, end, with, long, speeches, imagining, the, afterlife, in, the, timaeus, socrates, locates, the, parts, of, the, soul, within, the, human, body, reason, is, located, in, the, head, spirit, in, the, top, third, of, the, torso, and, the, appetite, in, the, middle, third, of, the, torso, down, to, the, navel, furthermore, plato, evinces, a, belief, in, the, theory, of, reincarnation, in, multiple, dialogues, such, as, the, phaedo, and, timaeus, scholars, debate, whether, he, intends, the, theory, to, be, literally, true, however, he, uses, this, idea, of, reincarnation, to, introduce, the, concept, that, knowledge, is, a, matter, of, recollection, of, things, acquainted, with, before, one, is, born, and, not, of, observation, or, study, keeping, with, the, theme, of, admitting, his, own, ignorance, socrates, regularly, complains, of, his, forgetfulness, in, the, meno, socrates, uses, a, geometrical, example, to, expound, plato, s, view, that, knowledge, in, this, latter, sense, is, acquired, by, recollection, socrates, elicits, a, fact, concerning, a, geometrical, construction, from, a, slave, boy, who, could, not, have, otherwise, known, the, fact, due, to, the, slave, boy, s, lack, of, education, the, knowledge, must, be, of, socrates, concludes, an, eternal, non, perceptible, form, plato, also, discusses, several, aspects, of, epistemology, in, several, dialogues, socrates, inverts, the, common, man, s, intuition, about, what, is, knowable, and, what, is, real, reality, is, unavailable, to, those, who, use, their, senses, socrates, says, that, he, who, sees, with, his, eyes, is, blind, while, most, people, take, the, objects, of, their, senses, to, be, real, if, anything, is, socrates, is, contemptuous, of, people, who, think, that, something, has, to, be, graspable, in, the, hands, to, be, real, in, the, theaetetus, he, says, such, people, are, eu, amousoi, an, expression, that, means, literally, happily, without, the, muses, in, other, words, such, people, are, willingly, ignorant, living, without, divine, inspiration, and, access, to, higher, insights, about, reality, many, have, interpreted, plato, as, stating, even, having, been, the, first, to, write, that, knowledge, is, justified, true, belief, an, influential, view, that, informed, future, developments, in, epistemology, plato, also, identified, problems, with, the, justified, true, belief, definition, in, the, theaetetus, concluding, that, justification, or, an, account, would, require, knowledge, of, difference, meaning, that, the, definition, of, knowledge, is, circular, in, the, sophist, statesman, republic, timaeus, and, the, parmenides, plato, associates, knowledge, with, the, apprehension, of, unchanging, forms, and, their, relationships, to, one, another, which, he, calls, expertise, in, dialectic, including, through, the, processes, of, collection, and, division, more, explicitly, plato, himself, argues, in, the, timaeus, that, knowledge, is, always, proportionate, to, the, realm, from, which, it, is, gained, in, other, words, if, one, derives, one, s, account, of, something, experientially, because, the, world, of, sense, is, in, flux, the, views, therein, attained, will, be, mere, opinions, meanwhile, opinions, are, characterized, by, a, lack, of, necessity, and, stability, on, the, other, hand, if, one, derives, one, s, account, of, something, by, way, of, the, non, sensible, forms, because, these, forms, are, unchanging, so, too, is, the, account, derived, from, them, that, apprehension, of, forms, is, required, for, knowledge, may, be, taken, to, cohere, with, plato, s, theory, in, the, theaetetus, and, meno, indeed, the, apprehension, of, forms, may, be, at, the, base, of, the, account, required, for, justification, in, that, it, offers, foundational, knowledge, which, itself, needs, no, account, thereby, avoiding, an, infinite, regression, several, dialogues, discuss, ethics, including, virtue, and, vice, pleasure, and, pain, crime, and, punishment, and, justice, and, medicine, socrates, presents, the, famous, euthyphro, dilemma, in, the, dialogue, of, the, same, name, is, the, pious, loved, by, the, gods, because, it, is, pious, or, is, it, pious, because, it, is, loved, by, the, gods, 10a, in, the, protagoras, dialogue, it, is, argued, through, socrates, that, virtue, is, innate, and, cannot, be, learned, that, no, one, does, bad, on, purpose, and, to, know, what, is, good, results, in, doing, what, is, good, that, knowledge, is, virtue, in, the, republic, plato, poses, the, question, what, is, justice, and, by, examining, both, individual, justice, and, the, justice, that, informs, societies, plato, is, able, not, only, to, inform, metaphysics, but, also, ethics, and, politics, with, the, question, what, is, the, basis, of, moral, and, social, obligation, plato, s, well, known, answer, rests, upon, the, fundamental, responsibility, to, seek, wisdom, wisdom, which, leads, to, an, understanding, of, the, form, of, the, good, plato, views, the, good, as, the, supreme, form, somehow, existing, even, beyond, being, in, this, manner, justice, is, obtained, when, knowledge, of, how, to, fulfill, one, s, moral, and, political, function, in, society, is, put, into, practice, the, dialogues, also, discuss, politics, some, of, plato, s, most, famous, doctrines, are, contained, in, the, republic, as, well, as, in, the, laws, and, the, statesman, because, these, opinions, are, not, spoken, directly, by, plato, and, vary, between, dialogues, they, cannot, be, straightforwardly, assumed, as, representing, plato, s, own, views, socrates, asserts, that, societies, have, a, tripartite, class, structure, corresponding, to, the, appetite, spirit, reason, structure, of, the, individual, soul, the, appetite, spirit, reason, are, analogous, to, the, castes, of, society, according, to, socrates, a, state, made, up, of, different, kinds, of, souls, will, overall, decline, from, an, aristocracy, rule, by, the, best, to, a, timocracy, rule, by, the, honourable, then, to, an, oligarchy, rule, by, the, few, then, to, a, democracy, rule, by, the, people, and, finally, to, tyranny, rule, by, one, person, rule, by, a, tyrant, several, dialogues, tackle, questions, about, art, including, rhetoric, and, rhapsody, socrates, says, that, poetry, is, inspired, by, the, muses, and, is, not, rational, he, speaks, approvingly, of, this, and, other, forms, of, divine, madness, drunkenness, eroticism, and, dreaming, in, the, phaedrus, and, yet, in, the, republic, wants, to, outlaw, homer, s, great, poetry, and, laughter, as, well, scholars, often, view, plato, s, philosophy, as, at, odds, with, rhetoric, due, to, his, criticisms, of, rhetoric, in, the, gorgias, and, his, ambivalence, toward, rhetoric, expressed, in, the, phaedrus, but, other, contemporary, researchers, contest, the, idea, that, plato, despised, rhetoric, and, instead, view, his, dialogues, as, a, dramatization, of, complex, rhetorical, principles, plato, made, abundant, use, of, mythological, narratives, in, his, own, work, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, main, purpose, for, plato, in, using, myths, was, didactic, he, considered, that, only, a, few, people, were, capable, or, interested, in, following, a, reasoned, philosophical, discourse, but, men, in, general, are, attracted, by, stories, and, tales, consequently, then, he, used, the, myth, to, convey, the, conclusions, of, the, philosophical, reasoning, notable, examples, include, the, story, of, atlantis, the, myth, of, er, and, the, allegory, of, the, cave, plato, never, presents, himself, as, a, participant, in, any, of, the, dialogues, and, with, the, exception, of, the, apology, there, is, no, suggestion, that, he, heard, any, of, the, dialogues, firsthand, some, dialogues, have, no, narrator, but, have, a, pure, dramatic, form, some, dialogues, are, narrated, by, socrates, himself, who, speaks, in, the, first, person, the, symposium, is, narrated, by, apollodorus, a, socratic, disciple, apparently, to, glaucon, apollodorus, assures, his, listener, that, he, is, recounting, the, story, which, took, place, when, he, himself, was, an, infant, not, from, his, own, memory, but, as, remembered, by, aristodemus, who, told, him, the, story, years, ago, the, theaetetus, is, also, a, peculiar, case, a, dialogue, in, dramatic, form, embedded, within, another, dialogue, in, dramatic, form, some, scholars, take, this, as, an, indication, that, plato, had, by, this, date, wearied, of, the, narrated, form, in, most, of, the, dialogues, the, primary, speaker, is, socrates, who, employs, a, method, of, questioning, which, proceeds, by, a, dialogue, form, called, dialectic, the, role, of, dialectic, in, plato, s, thought, is, contested, but, there, are, two, main, interpretations, a, type, of, reasoning, and, a, method, of, intuition, simon, blackburn, adopts, the, first, saying, that, plato, s, dialectic, is, the, process, of, eliciting, the, truth, by, means, of, questions, aimed, at, opening, out, what, is, already, implicitly, known, or, at, exposing, the, contradictions, and, muddles, of, an, opponent, s, position, karl, popper, on, the, other, hand, claims, that, dialectic, is, the, art, of, intuition, for, visualising, the, divine, originals, the, forms, or, ideas, of, unveiling, the, great, mystery, behind, the, common, man, s, everyday, world, of, appearances, during, the, early, renaissance, the, greek, language, and, along, with, it, plato, s, texts, were, reintroduced, to, western, europe, by, byzantine, scholars, some, 250, known, manuscripts, of, plato, survive, in, september, or, october, 1484, filippo, valori, and, francesco, berlinghieri, printed, 1025, copies, of, ficino, s, translation, using, the, printing, press, at, the, dominican, convent, of, san, jacopo, di, ripoli, the, 1578, edition, of, plato, s, complete, works, published, by, henricus, stephanus, henri, estienne, in, geneva, also, included, parallel, latin, translation, and, running, commentary, by, joannes, serranus, jean, de, serres, it, was, this, edition, which, established, standard, stephanus, pagination, still, in, use, today, the, text, of, plato, as, received, today, apparently, represents, the, complete, written, philosophical, work, of, plato, based, on, the, first, century, ad, arrangement, of, thrasyllus, of, mendes, the, modern, standard, complete, english, edition, is, the, 1997, hackett, plato, complete, works, edited, by, john, m, cooper, thirty, five, dialogues, and, thirteen, letters, the, epistles, have, traditionally, been, ascribed, to, plato, though, modern, scholarship, doubts, the, authenticity, of, at, least, some, of, these, jowett, mentions, in, his, appendix, to, menexenus, that, works, which, bore, the, character, of, a, writer, were, attributed, to, that, writer, even, when, the, actual, author, was, unknown, the, works, taken, as, genuine, in, antiquity, but, are, now, doubted, by, at, least, some, modern, scholars, are, alcibiades, i, alcibiades, ii, clitophon, epinomis, letters, hipparchus, menexenus, minos, lovers, theages, the, following, works, were, transmitted, under, plato, s, name, in, antiquity, but, were, already, considered, spurious, by, the, 1st, century, ad, axiochus, definitions, demodocus, epigrams, eryxias, halcyon, on, justice, on, virtue, sisyphus, no, one, knows, the, exact, order, plato, s, dialogues, were, written, in, nor, the, extent, to, which, some, might, have, been, later, revised, and, rewritten, the, works, are, usually, grouped, into, early, sometimes, by, some, into, transitional, middle, and, late, period, the, following, represents, one, relatively, common, division, whereas, those, classified, as, early, dialogues, often, conclude, in, aporia, the, so, called, middle, dialogues, provide, more, clearly, stated, positive, teachings, that, are, often, ascribed, to, plato, such, as, the, theory, of, forms, the, remaining, dialogues, are, classified, as, late, and, are, generally, agreed, to, be, difficult, and, challenging, pieces, of, philosophy, it, should, however, be, kept, in, mind, that, many, of, the, positions, in, the, ordering, are, still, highly, disputed, and, also, that, the, very, notion, that, plato, s, dialogues, can, or, should, be, ordered, is, by, no, means, universally, accepted, though, plato, s, works, are, still, often, characterized, as, falling, at, least, roughly, into, three, groups, stylistically, plato, s, unwritten, doctrines, are, according, to, some, ancient, sources, the, most, fundamental, metaphysical, teaching, of, plato, which, he, disclosed, only, orally, and, some, say, only, to, his, most, trusted, fellows, and, which, he, may, have, kept, secret, from, the, public, although, many, modern, scholars, doubt, these, claims, a, reason, for, not, revealing, it, to, everyone, is, partially, discussed, in, phaedrus, where, plato, criticizes, the, written, transmission, of, knowledge, as, faulty, favouring, instead, the, spoken, logos, he, who, has, knowledge, of, the, just, and, the, good, and, beautiful, will, not, when, in, earnest, write, them, in, ink, sowing, them, through, a, pen, with, words, which, cannot, defend, themselves, by, argument, and, cannot, teach, the, truth, effectually, it, is, however, said, that, plato, once, disclosed, this, knowledge, to, the, public, in, his, lecture, on, the, good, in, which, the, good, is, identified, with, the, one, the, unity, the, fundamental, ontological, principle, the, first, witness, who, mentions, its, existence, is, aristotle, who, in, his, physics, writes, it, is, true, indeed, that, the, account, he, gives, there, of, the, participant, is, different, from, what, he, says, in, his, so, called, unwritten, teachings, ancient, greek, romanized, agrapha, dogmata, in, metaphysics, he, writes, now, since, the, forms, are, the, causes, of, everything, else, he, supposed, that, their, elements, are, the, elements, of, all, things, accordingly, the, material, principle, is, the, great, and, small, and, the, essence, is, the, one, since, the, numbers, are, derived, from, the, great, and, small, by, participation, in, the, one, from, this, account, it, is, clear, that, he, only, employed, two, causes, that, of, the, essence, and, the, material, cause, for, the, forms, are, the, cause, of, the, essence, in, everything, else, and, the, one, is, the, cause, of, it, in, the, forms, he, also, tells, us, what, the, material, substrate, is, of, which, the, forms, are, predicated, in, the, case, of, sensible, things, and, the, one, in, that, of, the, forms, that, it, is, this, the, duality, the, dyad, the, great, and, small, further, he, assigned, to, these, two, elements, respectively, the, causation, of, good, and, of, evil, the, most, important, aspect, of, this, interpretation, of, plato, s, metaphysics, is, the, continuity, between, his, teaching, and, the, neoplatonic,

his, most, famous, student, aristotle, whose, reputation, during, the, western, middle, ages, so, completely, eclipsed, that, of, plato, that, the, scholastic, philosophers, referred, to, aristotle, as, the, philosopher, the, only, platonic, work, known, to, western, scholarship, was, timaeus, until, translations, were, made, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, which, occurred, during, 1453,

a, conduit, bridging, the, transcendental, nature, of, the, divine, with, the, tangible, reality, of, creation, in, the, islamic, context, neoplatonism, facilitated, the, integration, of, platonic,
