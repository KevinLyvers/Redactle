my, religion, she, was, baptized, a, christian, in, the, cedarville, presbyterian, church, in, the, summer, of, 1886, reading, giuseppe, mazzini, s, duties, of, man, she, began, to, be, inspired, by, the, idea, of, democracy, as, a, social, ideal, yet, she, felt, confused, about, her, role, as, a, woman, john, stuart, mill, s, the, subjection, of, women, made, her, question, the, social, pressures, on, a, woman, to, marry, and, devote, her, life, to, family, in, the, summer, of, 1887, addams, read, in, a, magazine, about, the, new, idea, of, starting, a, settlement, house, she, decided, to, visit, the, world, s, first, toynbee, hall, in, london, she, and, several, friends, including, ellen, gates, starr, traveled, in, europe, from, december, 1887, through, the, summer, of, 1888, after, watching, a, bullfight, in, madrid, fascinated, by, what, she, saw, as, an, exotic, tradition, addams, condemned, this, fascination, and, her, inability, to, feel, outraged, at, the, suffering, of, the, horses, and, bulls, at, first, addams, told, no, one, about, her, dream, to, start, a, settlement, house, but, she, felt, increasingly, guilty, for, not, acting, on, her, dream, believing, that, sharing, her, dream, might, help, her, to, act, on, it, she, told, ellen, gates, starr, starr, loved, the, idea, and, agreed, to, join, addams, in, starting, a, settlement, house, addams, and, another, friend, traveled, to, london, without, starr, who, was, busy, visiting, toynbee, hall, addams, was, enchanted, she, described, it, as, a, community, of, university, men, who, live, there, have, their, recreation, clubs, and, society, all, among, the, poor, people, yet, in, the, same, style, in, which, they, would, live, in, their, own, circle, it, is, so, free, of, professional, doing, good, so, unaffectedly, sincere, and, so, productive, of, good, results, in, its, classes, and, libraries, seems, perfectly, ideal, addams, s, dream, of, the, classes, mingling, socially, to, mutual, benefit, as, they, had, in, early, christian, circles, seemed, embodied, in, the, new, type, of, institution, the, settlement, house, as, addams, discovered, was, a, space, within, which, unexpected, cultural, connections, could, be, made, and, where, the, narrow, boundaries, of, culture, class, and, education, could, be, expanded, they, doubled, as, community, arts, centers, and, social, service, facilities, they, laid, the, foundations, for, american, civil, society, a, neutral, space, within, which, different, communities, and, ideologies, could, learn, from, each, other, and, seek, common, grounds, for, collective, action, the, role, of, the, settlement, house, was, an, unending, effort, to, make, culture, and, the, issue, of, things, go, together, the, unending, effort, was, the, story, of, her, own, life, a, struggle, to, reinvigorate, her, own, culture, by, reconnecting, with, diversity, and, conflict, of, the, immigrant, communities, in, america, s, cities, and, with, the, necessities, of, social, reform, in, 1889, addams, and, her, college, friend, and, paramour, ellen, gates, starr, co, founded, hull, house, a, settlement, house, in, chicago, the, run, down, mansion, had, been, built, by, charles, hull, in, 1856, and, needed, repairs, and, upgrading, addams, at, first, paid, for, all, of, the, capital, expenses, repairing, the, roof, of, the, porch, repainting, the, rooms, buying, furniture, and, most, of, the, operating, costs, however, gifts, from, individuals, supported, the, house, beginning, in, its, first, year, and, addams, was, able, to, reduce, the, proportion, of, her, contributions, although, the, annual, budget, grew, rapidly, some, wealthy, women, became, long, term, donors, to, the, house, including, helen, culver, who, managed, her, first, cousin, charles, hull, s, estate, and, who, eventually, allowed, the, contributors, to, use, the, house, rent, free, other, contributors, were, louise, dekoven, bowen, mary, rozet, smith, mary, wilmarth, and, others, addams, and, starr, were, the, first, two, occupants, of, the, house, which, would, later, become, the, residence, of, about, 25, women, at, its, height, hull, house, was, visited, each, week, by, some, 2, 000, people, hull, house, was, a, center, for, research, empirical, analysis, study, and, debate, as, well, as, a, pragmatic, center, for, living, in, and, establishing, good, relations, with, the, neighborhood, among, the, aims, of, hull, house, was, to, give, privileged, educated, young, people, contact, with, the, real, life, of, the, majority, of, the, population, residents, of, hull, house, conducted, investigations, on, housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage, collection, cocaine, and, truancy, the, core, hull, house, residents, were, well, educated, women, bound, together, by, their, commitment, to, labour, unions, the, national, consumers, league, and, the, suffrage, movement, dr, harriett, alleyne, rice, joined, hull, house, to, provide, medical, treatment, for, poor, families, its, facilities, included, a, night, school, for, adults, clubs, for, older, children, a, public, kitchen, an, art, gallery, a, gym, a, girls, club, a, bathhouse, a, book, bindery, a, music, school, a, drama, group, and, a, theater, apartments, a, library, meeting, rooms, for, discussion, clubs, an, employment, bureau, and, a, lunchroom, her, adult, night, school, was, a, forerunner, of, the, continuing, education, classes, offered, by, many, universities, today, in, addition, to, making, available, social, services, and, cultural, events, for, the, largely, immigrant, population, of, the, neighborhood, hull, house, afforded, an, opportunity, for, young, social, workers, to, acquire, training, eventually, hull, house, became, a, 13, building, settlement, complex, which, included, a, playground, and, a, summer, camp, known, as, bowen, country, club, one, aspect, of, the, hull, house, that, was, very, important, to, jane, addams, was, the, art, program, the, art, program, at, hull, house, allowed, addams, to, challenge, the, system, of, industrialized, education, which, fitted, the, individual, to, a, specific, job, or, position, she, wanted, the, house, to, provide, a, space, time, and, tools, to, encourage, people, to, think, independently, she, saw, art, as, the, key, to, unlocking, the, diversity, of, the, city, through, collective, interaction, mutual, self, discovery, recreation, and, the, imagination, art, was, integral, to, her, vision, of, community, disrupting, fixed, ideas, and, stimulating, the, diversity, and, interaction, on, which, a, healthy, society, depends, based, on, a, continual, rewriting, of, cultural, identities, through, variation, and, interculturalism, with, funding, from, edward, butler, addams, opened, an, art, exhibition, and, studio, space, as, one, of, the, first, additions, to, hull, house, on, the, first, floor, of, the, new, addition, there, was, a, branch, of, the, chicago, public, library, and, the, second, was, the, butler, art, gallery, which, featured, recreations, of, famous, artwork, as, well, as, the, work, of, local, artists, studio, space, within, the, art, gallery, provided, both, hull, house, residents, and, the, entire, community, with, the, opportunity, to, take, art, classes, or, to, come, in, and, hone, their, craft, whenever, they, liked, as, hull, house, grew, and, the, relationship, with, the, neighborhood, deepened, that, opportunity, became, less, of, a, comfort, to, the, poor, and, more, of, an, outlet, of, expression, and, exchange, of, different, cultures, and, diverse, communities, art, and, culture, was, becoming, a, bigger, and, more, important, part, of, the, lives, of, immigrants, within, the, 19th, ward, and, soon, children, caught, on, to, the, trend, these, working, class, children, were, offered, instruction, in, all, forms, and, levels, of, art, places, such, as, the, butler, art, gallery, or, the, bowen, country, club, often, hosted, these, classes, but, more, informal, lessons, would, often, be, taught, outdoors, addams, with, the, help, of, ellen, gates, starr, founded, the, chicago, public, school, art, society, cpsas, in, response, to, the, positive, reaction, the, art, classes, for, children, caused, the, cpsas, provided, public, schools, with, reproductions, of, world, renowned, pieces, of, art, hired, artists, to, teach, children, how, to, create, art, and, also, took, the, students, on, field, trips, to, chicago, s, many, art, museums, the, hull, house, neighborhood, was, a, mix, of, european, ethnic, groups, that, had, immigrated, to, chicago, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, that, mix, was, the, ground, where, hull, house, s, inner, social, and, philanthropic, elitists, tested, their, theories, and, challenged, the, establishment, the, ethnic, mix, is, recorded, by, the, bethlehem, howard, neighborhood, center, germans, and, jews, resided, south, of, that, inner, core, south, of, twelfth, street, the, greek, delta, formed, by, harrison, halsted, street, and, blue, island, streets,

the, river, on, the, east, end, on, out, to, the, western, ends, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, little, italy, greeks, and, jews, along, with, the, remnants, of, other, immigrant, groups, began, their, exodus, from, the, neighborhood, in, the, early, 20th, century, only, italians, continued, as, an, intact, and, thriving, community, through, the, great, depression, world, war, ii, and, well, beyond, the, ultimate, demise, of, hull, house, proper, in, 1963, hull, house, became, america, s, best, known, settlement, house, addams, used, it, to, generate, system, directed, change, on, the, principle, that, to, keep, families, safe, community, and, societal, conditions, had, to, be, improved, the, neighborhood, was, controlled, by, local, political, bosses, starr, and, addams, developed, three, ethical, principles, for, social, settlements, to, teach, by, example, to, practice, cooperation, and, to, practice, social, democracy, that, is, egalitarian, or, democratic, social, relations, across, class, lines, thus, hull, house, offered, a, comprehensive, program, of, civic, cultural, recreational, and, educational, activities, and, attracted, admiring, visitors, from, all, over, the, world, including, william, lyon, mackenzie, king, a, graduate, student, from, harvard, university, who, later, became, prime, minister, of, canada, in, the, 1890s, julia, lathrop, florence, kelley, and, other, residents, of, the, house, made, it, a, world, center, of, social, reform, activity, hull, house, used, the, latest, methodology, pioneering, in, statistical, mapping, to, study,

party, and, supported, the, presidential, campaign, of, theodore, roosevelt, addams, philosophy, combined, feminist, sensibilities, with, an, unwavering, commitment, to, social, improvement, through, cooperative, efforts, although, she, sympathized, with, feminists, socialists, and, pacifists, addams, refused, to, be, labeled, this, refusal, was, pragmatic, rather, than, ideological, hull, house, stressed, the, importance, of, the, role, of, children, in, the, americanization, process, of, new, immigrants, this, philosophy, also, fostered, the, play, movement, and, the, research, and, service, fields, of, leisure, youth, and, human, services, addams, argued, in, the, spirit, of, youth, and, the, city, streets, 1909, that, play, and, recreation, programs, are, needed, because, cities, are, destroying, the, spirit, of, youth, hull, house, featured, multiple, programs, in, art, and, drama, kindergarten, classes, boys, and, girls, clubs, language, classes, reading, groups, college, extension, courses, along, with, public, baths, a, gymnasium, a, labor, museum, and, playground, all, within, a, free, speech, atmosphere, they, were, all, designed, to, foster, democratic, cooperation, collective, action, and, downplay, individualism, she, helped, pass, the, first, model, tenement, code, and, the, first, factory, laws, along, with, her, colleagues, from, hull, house, in, 1901, jane, addams, founded, what, would, become, the, juvenile, protective, association, jpa, provided, the, first, probation, officers, for, the, first, juvenile, court, in, the, united, states,

prostitution, in, chicago, and, their, effects, on, child, development, through, the, years, their, mission, has, now, become, improving, the, social, and, emotional, well, being, and, functioning, of, vulnerable, children, so, they, can, reach, their, fullest, potential, at, home, in, school, and, in, their, communities, addams, and, her, colleagues, documented, the, communal, geography, of, typhoid, fever, and, reported, that, poor, workers, were, bearing, the, brunt, of, the, illness, she, identified, the, political, corruption, and, business, avarice, that, caused, the, city, bureaucracy, to, ignore, health, sanitation, and, building, codes, linking, environmental, justice, and, municipal, reform, she, eventually, defeated, the, bosses, and, fostered, a, more, equitable, distribution, of, city, services, and, modernized, inspection, practices, addams, spoke, of, the, undoubted, powers, of, public, recreation, to, bring, together, the, classes, of, a, community, in, the, keeping, them, apart, addams, worked, with, the, chicago, board, of, health, and, served, as, the, first, vice, president, of, the, playground, association, of, america, in, 1912, addams, published, a, new, conscience, and, ancient, evil, about, prostitution, this, book, was, extremely, popular, addams, believed, that, prostitution, was, a, result, of, kidnapping, only, her, book, later, inspired, stella, wynne, herron, s, 1916, short, story, shoes, which, lois, weber, adapted, into, a, groundbreaking, 1916, film, of, the, same, name, addams, and, her, colleagues, originally, intended, hull, house, as, a, transmission, device, to, bring, the, values, of, the, college, educated, high, culture, to, the, masses, including, the, efficiency, movement, a, major, movement, in, industrial, nations, in, the, early, 20th, century, that, sought, to, identify, and, eliminate, waste, in, the, economy, and, society, and, to, develop, and, implement, best, practices, however, over, time, the, focus, changed, from, bringing, art, and, culture, to, the, neighborhood, as, evidenced, in, the, construction, of, the, butler, building, to, responding, to, the, needs, of, the, community, by, providing, childcare, educational, opportunities, and, large, meeting, spaces, hull, house, became, more, than, a, proving, ground, for, the, new, generation, of, college, educated, professional, women, it, also, became, part, of, the, community, in, which, it, was, founded, and, its, development, reveals, a, shared, history, addams, called, on, women, especially, middle, class, women, with, leisure, time, and, energy, as, well, as, rich, philanthropists, to, exercise, their, civic, duty, to, become, involved, in, municipal, affairs, as, a, matter, of, civic, housekeeping, addams, thereby, enlarged, the, concept, of, civic, duty, to, include, roles, for, women, beyond, motherhood, which, involved, child, rearing, women, s, lives, revolved, around, responsibility, care, and, obligation, which, represented, the, source, of, women, s, power, this, notion, provided, the, foundation, for, the, municipal, or, civil, housekeeping, role, that, addams, defined, and, gave, added, weight, to, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, that, addams, supported, addams, argued, that, women, as, opposed, to, men, were, trained, in, the, delicate, matters, of, human, welfare, and, needed, to, build, upon, their, traditional, roles, of, housekeeping, to, be, civic, housekeepers, enlarged, housekeeping, duties, involved, reform, efforts, regarding, poisonous, sewage, impure,

garbage, collection, reduced, death, and, disease, addams, had, long, discussions, with, philosopher, john, dewey, in, which, they, redefined, democracy, in, terms, of, pragmatism, and, civic,
