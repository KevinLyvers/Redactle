crusades, progressed, he, acquired, control, of, jerusalem, and, styled, himself, its, king, however, the, papacy, became, his, enemy, and, it, eventually, prevailed, viewing, himself, as, a, direct, successor, to, the, roman, emperors, of, antiquity, he, was, emperor, of, the, romans, from, his, papal, coronation, in, 1220, until, his, death, he, was, also, a, claimant, to, the, title, of, king, of, the, romans, from, 1212, and, unopposed, holder, of, that, monarchy, from, 1215, as, such, he, was, king, of, germany, of, italy, and, of, burgundy, at, the, age, of, three, he, was, crowned,

sicily, the, regno, to, the, south, he, was, excommunicated, four, times, between, 1227, and, his, own, death, in, 1250, and, was, often, vilified, in, pro, papal, chronicles, of, the, time, and, after, pope, gregory, ix, went, so, far, as, to, declare, him, preambulus, antichristi, predecessor, of, the, antichrist, speaking, six, languages, latin, sicilian, middle, high, german, old, french, greek, and, arabic, frederick, has, a, reputation, as, a, renaissance, man, avant, la, lettre, as, scientist, scholar, architect, poet, and, composer, as, an, avid, patron, of, science, and, the, arts, he, played, a, major, role, in, promoting, literature, through, the, sicilian, school, of, poetry, his, sicilian, royal, court, in, palermo, beginning, around, 1220, saw, the, first, use, of, a, literary, form, of, an, italo, romance, language, sicilian, the, poetry, that, emanated, from, the, school, had, a, significant, influence, on, literature, and, on, what, was, to, become, the, modern, italian, language, he, was, also, the, first, king, to, formally, outlaw, trial, by, ordeal, which, had, come, to, be, viewed, as, superstitious, after, his, death, his, line, did, not, survive, and, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, came, to, an, end, furthermore, the, holy, roman, empire, entered, a, long, period, of, decline, during, the, great, interregnum, his, complex, political, and, cultural, legacy, has, attracted, fierce, debates, until, this, day, born, in, jesi, near, ancona, italy, on, 26, december, 1194, frederick, was, the, son, of, henry, vi, holy, roman, emperor, he, was, known, as, the, puer, apuliae, son, of, apulia, his, mother, was, constance, of, sicily, frederick, was, baptised, in, assisi, in, the, church, of, san, rufino, at, birth, frederick, was, named, constantine, by, his, mother, this, name, a, masculine, form, of, his, mother, s, name, served, to, identify, him, closely, with, both, his, norman, heritage, and, his, imperial, heritage, through, constantine, the, great, the, first, christian, emperor, it, was, still, his, name, at, the, time, of, his, election, as, king, of, the, romans, he, was, only, given, his, grandfathers, names, becoming, frederick, roger, or, roger, frederick, at, his, baptism, when, he, was, two, years, old, this, dual, name, served, the, same, purpose, as, constantine, emphasising, his, dual, heritage, frederick, s, birth, was, accompanied, by, gossip, and, rumour, on, account, of, his, mother, s, advanced, age, according, to, albert, of, stade, and, salimbene, he, was, not, the, son, of, henry, and, constance, but, was, presented, to, henry, as, his, own, after, a, faked, pregnancy, his, real, father, was, variously, described, as, a, butcher, of, jesi, a, physician, a, miller, or, a, falconer, frederick, s, birth, was, also, associated, with, a, prophecy, of, merlin, according, to, andrea, dandolo, writing, at, some, distance, but, probably, recording, contemporary, gossip, henry, doubted, reports, of, his, wife, s, pregnancy, and, was, only, convinced, by, consulting, joachim, of, fiore, who, confirmed, that, frederick, was, his, son, by, interpretation, of, merlin, s, prophecy, and, the, erythraean, sibyl, a, later, legend, claims, that, constance, gave, birth, in, the, public, square, of, jesi, to, silence, doubters, constance, took, unusual, measures, to, prove, her, pregnancy, and, its, legitimacy, and, roger, of, howden, reports, that, she, swore, on, the, gospels, before, a, papal, legate, that, frederick, was, her, son, by, henry, it, is, probable, that, these, public, acts, of, affirmation, on, account, of, her, age, gave, rise, to, some, false, rumours, in, the, spring, of, 1195, a, few, months, after, henry, vi, had, been, crowned, king, of, sicily, and, not, long, after, the, birth, of, her, son, constance, the, empress, continued, her, journey, to, palermo, after, the, unexpected, death, of, tancred, of, lecce, an, illegitimate, son, of, roger, eldest, son, of, roger, ii, of, sicily, henry, had, hurried, over, to, assume, power, and, to, have, himself, crowned, king, frederick, was, entrusted, to, the, care, of, the, duchess, of, spoleto, the, wife, of, the, swabian, noble, conrad, i, of, urslingen, who, was, named, duke, of, spoleto, by, frederick, barbarossa, frederick, ii, stayed, in, foligno, a, place, located, in, papal, territory, and, so, under, papal, jurisdiction, until, the, death, of, his, father, on, september, 28, in, 1197, in, 1196, at, frankfurt, am, main, the, infant, frederick, was, elected, king, of, the, romans, and, thus, heir, to, his, father, s, imperial, crown, his, rights, in, germany, were, to, end, up, disputed, by, henry, s, brother, philip, of, swabia, and, otto, of, brunswick, at, the, death, of, his, father, henry, vi, in, 1197, frederick, was, in, italy, traveling, towards, germany, when, the, bad, news, reached, his, guardian, conrad, of, spoleto, frederick, was, hastily, brought, back, to, his, mother, constance, in, palermo, sicily, where, he, was, crowned, king, of, sicily, on, 17, may, 1198, at, just, three, years, of, age, originally, his, title, had, been, romanorum, et, sicilie, rex, king, of, the, romans, and, sicily, but, in, 1198, after, constance, who, kept, using, title, of, empress, found, out, that, philip, of, swabia, had, been, recognized, by, the, staufer, supporters, in, germany, she, had, her, son, renounce, the, title, king, of, the, romans, she, probably, agreed, with, philip, that, frederick, s, prospects, in, germany, were, hopeless, the, decision, strengthened, frederick, s, position, in, sicily, as, this, satisfied, both, philip, of, swabia, and, the, pope, who, did, not, like, the, idea, of, a, ruler, who, had, authority, in, both, sicily, and, the, north, alpine, realm, constance, of, sicily, was, in, her, own, right, queen, of, sicily, and, she, established, herself, as, regent, constance, sided, with, the, pope, who, preferred, that, sicily, and, the, germans, were, under, separate, governments, she, renounced, the, authority, over, the, sicilian, state, church, to, the, papal, side, but, only, as, sicilian, queen, and, not, as, empress, seemingly, with, the, intention, of, keeping, options, open, for, frederick, upon, constance, s, death, in, 1198, pope, innocent, iii, succeeded, as, frederick, s, guardian, frederick, s, tutor, during, this, period, was, cencio, who, would, become, pope, honorius, iii, markward, of, annweiler, with, the, support, of, henry, s, brother, philip, of, swabia, reclaimed, the, regency, for, himself, and, soon, after, invaded, the, kingdom, of, sicily, in, 1200, with, the, help, of, genoese, ships, he, landed, in, sicily, and, one, year, later, seized, the, young, frederick, he, thus, ruled, sicily, until, 1202, when, he, was, succeeded, by, another, german, captain, william, of, capparone, who, kept, frederick, under, his, control, in, the, royal, palace, of, palermo, until, 1206, frederick, was, subsequently, under, tutor, walter, of, palearia, until, in, 1208, he, was, declared, of, age, at, that, time, he, spoke, five, languages, greek, arabic, latin, proven, al, and, sicilian, his, first, task, was, to, reassert, his, power, over, sicily, and, southern, italy, where, local, barons, and, adventurers, had, usurped, most, of, the, authority, pope, innocent, was, in, search, of, a, diplomatic, match, for, his, protege, frederick, to, enable, him, successful, future, alliances, eventually, constance, of, aragon, a, widow, of, the, late, king, of, hungary, and, double, his, age, was, found, otto, of, brunswick, had, been, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, by, pope, innocent, iii, in, october, 1209, in, southern, italy, otto, became, the, champion, of, those, noblemen, and, barons, who, feared, frederick, s, increasingly, strong, measures, to, check, their, power, such, as, the, dismissal, of, the, pro, noble, walter, of, palearia, the, new, emperor, invaded, italy, where, he, reached, calabria, without, meeting, much, resistance, in, response, innocent, sided, against, otto, and, in, september, 1211, at, the, diet, of, nuremberg, frederick, was, elected, in, absentia, as, german, king, by, a, rebellious, faction, backed, by, the, pope, innocent, also, excommunicated, otto, who, was, forced, to, return, to, germany, frederick, sailed, to, gaeta, with, a, small, following, he, agreed, with, the, pope, on, a, future, separation, between, the, sicilian, and, imperial, titles, and, named, his, wife, constance, as, regent, passing, through, lombardy, and, engadin, he, reached, konstanz, in, september, 1212, preceding, otto, by, a, few, hours, frederick, was, crowned, king, on, 9, december, 1212, in, mainz, frederick, s, authority, in, germany, remained, tenuous, and, he, was, recognized, only, in, southern, germany, in, the, region, of, northern, germany, the, center, of, guelph, power, otto, continued, to, hold, the, reins, of, royal, and, imperial, power, despite, his, excommunication, otto, s, decisive, military, defeat, at, the, bouvines, forced, him, to, withdraw, to, the, guelph, hereditary, lands, where, virtually, without, supporters, he, died, in, 1218, the, german, princes, supported, by, innocent, iii, again, elected, frederick, king, of, germany, in, 1215, and, he, was, crowned, king, in, aachen, in, mid, july, 1215, by, one, of, the, three, german, archbishops, frederick, then, astonished, the, crowd, by, taking, the, cross, and, calling, upon, the, nobles, present, to, do, the, same, it, was, not, until, another, five, years, had, passed, and, only, after, further, negotiations, between, frederick, innocent, iii, and, honorius, iii, who, succeeded, to, the, papacy, after, innocent, s, death, in, 1216, that, frederick, was, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, in, rome, by, honorius, iii, on, 22, november, 1220, at, the, same, time, frederick, s, oldest, son, henry, took, the, title, of, king, of, the, romans, unlike, most, holy, roman, emperors, frederick, spent, few, years, in, germany, in, 1218, he, helped, king, philip, ii, of, france, and, odo, iii, duke, of, burgundy, to, bring, an, end, to, the, war, of, succession, in, champagne, france, by, invading, lorraine, capturing, and, burning, nancy, capturing, theobald, i, duke, of, lorraine, and, forcing, him, to, withdraw, his, support, from, erard, of, brienne, ramerupt, after, his, coronation, in, 1220, frederick, remained, either, in, the, kingdom, of, sicily, or, on, crusade, until, 1236, when, he, made, his, last, journey, to, germany, he, returned, to, italy, in, 1237, and, stayed, there, for, the, remaining, thirteen, years, of, his, life, represented, in, germany, by, his, son, conrad, in, the, kingdom, of, sicily, he, built, on, the, reform, of, the, laws, begun, at, the, assizes, of, ariano, in, 1140, by, his, grandfather, roger, ii, his, initiative, in, this, direction, was, visible, as, early, as, the, assizes, of, capua, 1220, issued, soon, after, his, coronation, in, rome, but, came, to, fruition, in, his, promulgation, of, the, constitutions, of, melfi, 1231, also, known, as, liber, augustalis, a, collection, of, laws, for, his, realm, that, was, remarkable, for, its, time, and, was, a, source, of, inspiration, for, a, long, time, after, it, made, the, kingdom, of, sicily, an, absolutist, monarchy, it, also, set, a, precedent, for, the, primacy, of, written, law, with, relatively, small, modifications, the, liber, augustalis, remained, the, basis, of, sicilian, law, until, 1819, in, 1223, 1224, frederick, tried, bishop, aldoin, of, cefal, for, maladministration, the, trial, was, nullified, by, the, pope, on, procedural, grounds, at, the, time, he, was, elected, king, of, the, romans, frederick, promised, to, go, on, crusade, he, continually, delayed, however, and, in, spite, of, his, renewal, of, this, vow, at, his, coronation, as, the, king, of, germany, he, did, not, travel, to, egypt, with, the, armies, of, the, fifth, crusade, in, 1217, he, sent, forces, to, egypt, under, the, command, of, louis, i, duke, of, bavaria, but, constant, expectation, of, his, arrival, caused, papal, legate, pelagius, to, reject, ayyubid, sultan, al, kamil, s, offer, to, restore, the, latin, kingdom, of, jerusalem, to, the, crusaders, in, exchange, for, their, withdrawal, from, egypt, and, caused, the, crusade, to, continually, stall, in, anticipation, of, his, ever, delayed, arrival, the, crusade, ended, in, failure, with, the, loss, of, damietta, in, 1221, frederick, was, blamed, by, both, pope, honorius, iii, and, the, general, christian, populace, for, this, calamitous, defeat, in, 1225, after, agreeing, with, pope, honorius, to, launch, a, crusade, before, 1228, frederick, summoned, an, imperial, diet, at, cremona, the, main, pro, imperial, city, in, lombardy, the, main, arguments, for, holding, the, diet, would, be, to, continue, the, struggle, against, heresy, to, organize, the, crusade, and, above, all, to, restore, the, imperial, power, in, northern, italy, which, had, long, been, usurped, by, the, numerous, communes, located, there, those, assembled, responded, with, the, reformation, of, the, lombard, league, which, had, already, defeated, his, grandfather, frederick, barbarossa, in, the, 12th, century, and, again, milan, was, chosen, as, the, league, s, leader, the, diet, was, cancelled, however, and, the, situation, was, stabilized, only, through, a, compromise, reached, by, honorius, between, frederick, and, the, league, during, his, sojourn, in, northern, italy, frederick, also, invested, the, teutonic, order, with, the, territories, in, what, would, become, east, prussia, starting, what, was, later, called, the, northern, crusade, frederick, was, distracted, with, the, league, when, in, june, 1226, louis, viii, of, france, laid, siege, to, avignon, an, imperial, city, the, barons, of, the, french, army, sent, a, letter, to, frederick, defending, their, action, as, a, military, necessity, and, a, few, days, after, the, start, of, the, siege, henry, vii, ratified, an, alliance, with, france, that, had, been, signed, in, 1223, problems, of, stability, within, the, empire, delayed, frederick, s, departure, on, crusade, it, was, not, until, 1225, when, by, proxy, frederick, had, married, isabella, ii, of, jerusalem, heiress, to, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, that, his, departure, seemed, assured, frederick, immediately, saw, to, it, that, his, new, father, in, law, john, of, brienne, the, current, king, of, jerusalem, was, dispossessed, and, his, rights, transferred, to, the, emperor, in, august, 1227, frederick, set, out, for, the, holy, land, from, brindisi, but, was, forced, to, return, when, he, was, struck, down, by, an, epidemic, that, had, broken, out, even, the, master, of, the, teutonic, knights, hermann, of, salza, recommended, that, he, return, to, the, mainland, to, recuperate, on, 29, september, 1227, frederick, was, excommunicated, by, pope, gregory, ix, for, failing, to, honor, his, crusading, pledge, many, contemporary, chroniclers, doubted, the, sincerity, of, frederick, s, illness, and, their, attitude, may, be, explained, by, their, pro, papal, leanings, roger, of, wendover, a, chronicler, of, the, time, wrote, that, frederick, went, to, the, mediterranean, sea, and, embarked, with, a, small, retinue, but, after, pretending, to, make, for, the, holy, land, for, three, days, he, said, that, he, was, seized, with, a, sudden, illness, this, conduct, of, the, emperor, redounded, much, to, his, disgrace, and, to, the, injury, of, the, whole, business, of, the, crusade, frederick, eventually, sailed, again, from, brindisi, in, june, 1228, the, pope, still, gregory, ix, regarded, that, action, as, a, provocation, since, as, an, excommunicate, frederick, was, technically, not, capable, of, conducting, a, crusade, and, he, excommunicated, the, emperor, a, second, time, frederick, reached, acre, in, september, many, of, the, local, nobility, the, templars, and, hospitallers, were, therefore, reluctant, to, offer, overt, support, since, the, crusading, army, was, already, a, small, force, frederick, negotiated, along, the, lines, of, a, previous, agreement, he, had, intended, to, broker, with, the, ayyubid, sultan, al, kamil, the, treaty, signed, in, february, 1229, resulted, in, the, restitution, of, jerusalem, nazareth, bethlehem, and, a, small, coastal, strip, to, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, though, there, are, disagreements, as, to, the, extent, of, the, territory, returned, the, treaty, also, stipulated, that, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, al, aqsa, mosque, were, to, remain, under, muslim, control, and, that, the, city, of, jerusalem, would, remain, without, fortifications, virtually, all, other, crusaders, including, the, templars, and, hospitallers, condemned, this, deal, as, a, political, ploy, on, the, part, of, frederick, to, regain, his, kingdom, while, betraying, the, cause, of, the, crusaders, al, kamil, who, was, nervous, about, possible, war, with, his, relatives, who, ruled, syria, and, mesopotamia, wished, to, avoid, further, trouble, from, the, christians, at, least, until, his, domestic, rivals, were, subdued, the, crusade, ended, in, a, truce, and, in, frederick, s, coronation, as, king, of, jerusalem, on, 18, march, 1229, although, this, was, technically, improper, frederick, s, wife, isabella, the, heiress, had, died, leaving, their, infant, son, conrad, as, rightful, king, there, is, also, disagreement, as, to, whether, the, coronation, was, a, coronation, at, all, as, a, letter, written, by, frederick, to, henry, iii, of, england, suggests, that, the, crown, he, placed, on, his, own, head, was, in, fact, the, imperial, crown, of, the, romans, at, his, coronation, he, may, have, worn, the, red, silk, mantle, that, had, been, crafted, during, the, reign, of, roger, ii, it, bore, an, arabic, inscription, indicating, that, the, robe, dated, from, the, year, 528, in, the, muslim, calendar, and, incorporated, a, generic, benediction, wishing, its, wearer, vast, prosperity, great, generosity, and, high, splendor, fame, and, magnificent, endowments, and, the, fulfillment, of, his, wishes, and, hopes, may, his, days, and, nights, go, in, pleasure, without, end, or, change, this, coronation, robe, can, be, found, today, in, the, schatzkammer, of, the, kunsthistorisches, museum, in, vienna, in, any, case, gerald, of, lausanne, the, latin, patriarch, of, jerusalem, did, not, attend, the, ceremony, indeed, the, next, day, the, bishop, of, caesarea, arrived, to, place, the, city, under, interdict, on, the, patriarch, s, orders, frederick, s, further, attempts, to, rule, over, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, were, met, by, resistance, on, the, part, of, the, barons, led, by, john, of, ibelin, lord, of, beirut, in, the, mid, 1230s, frederick, s, viceroy, was, forced, to, leave, acre, and, in, 1244, following, a, siege, jerusalem, itself, was, lost, again, to, a, new, muslim, offensive, whilst, frederick, s, seeming, bloodless, recovery, of, jerusalem, for, the, cross, brought, him, great, prestige, in, some, european, circles, his, decision, to, complete, the, crusade, while, excommunicated, provoked, church, hostility, although, in, 1230, the, pope, lifted, frederick, s, excommunication, this, decision, was, taken, for, a, variety, of, reasons, related, to, the, political, situation, in, europe, of, frederick, s, crusade, philip, of, novara, a, chronicler, of, the, period, said, the, emperor, left, acre, hated, cursed, and, vilified, overall, this, crusade, arguably, the, first, successful, one, since, the, first, crusade, was, adversely, affected, by, the, manner, in, which, frederick, carried, out, negotiations, without, the, support, of, the, church, he, left, behind, a, kingdom, in, the, levant, torn, between, his, agents, and, the, local, nobility, a, civil, war, known, as, the, war, of, the, lombards, the, itinerant, joachimite, preachers, and, many, radical, franciscans, the, spirituals, supported, frederick, against, the, interdict, pronounced, on, his, lands, the, preachers, condemned, the, pope, and, continued, to, minister, the, sacraments, and, grant, absolutions, brother, arnold, in, swabia, proclaimed, the, second, coming, for, 1260, at, which, time, frederick, would, then, confiscate, the, riches, of, rome, and, distribute, them, among, the, poor, the, only, true, christians, during, frederick, s, stay, in, the, holy, land, his, regent, rainald, of, spoleto, had, attacked, the, march, of, ancona, and, the, duchy, of, spoleto, gregory, ix, recruited, an, army, under, john, of, brienne, and, in, 1229, invaded, southern, italy, his, troops, overcame, an, initial, resistance, at, montecassino, and, reached, into, campania, as, far, as, the, volturno, irpino, frederick, arrived, at, brindisi, in, june, 1229, he, quickly, recovered, the, lost, territories, and, tried, and, condemned, the, rebel, barons, but, avoided, crossing, the, borders, of, the, papal, states, the, war, came, to, an, end, with, the, treaty, of, san, germano, in, july, 1230, on, 28, august, in, a, public, ceremony, in, ceprano, the, papal, legates, thomas, of, capua, and, giovanni, colonna, absolved, frederick, and, lifted, his, excommunication, the, emperor, personally, met, gregory, ix, at, anagni, making, some, concessions, to, the, church, in, sicily, he, also, issued, the, constitutions, of, melfi, august, 1231, as, an, attempt, to, solve, the, political, and, administrative, problems, of, the, country, which, had, dramatically, been, shown, by, the, recent, war, while, he, may, have, temporarily, made, his, peace, with, the, pope, frederick, found, the, german, princes, another, matter, frederick, s, son, henry, vii, who, was, born, 1211, in, sicily, son, of, frederick, s, first, wife, constance, of, aragon, had, caused, their, discontent, with, an, aggressive, policy, against, their, privileges, this, forced, henry, to, a, complete, capitulation, and, the, statutum, in, favorem, principum, statutes, in, favor, of, the, princes, issued, at, worms, deprived, the, emperor, of, much, of, his, sovereignty, in, germany, frederick, summoned, henry, to, a, meeting, which, was, held, at, aquileia, in, 1232, henry, confirmed, his, submission, but, frederick, was, nevertheless, compelled, to, confirm, the, statutum, at, cividale, soon, afterwards, the, situation, for, frederick, was,

demand, of, total, surrender, spurred, further, resistance, from, milan, brescia, bologna, and, piacenza, and, in, october, 1238, he, was, forced, to, raise, the, siege, of, brescia, in, the, course, of, which, his, enemies, had, tried, unsuccessfully, to, capture, him, frederick, received, the, news, of, his, excommunication, by, gregory, ix, in, the, first, months, of, 1239, 149, while, his,

fruition, as, he, chose, to, leave, for, southern, italy, where, a, papal, incited, rebellion, flared, in, apulia, in, southern, italy, frederick, attacked, and, razed, st, angelo, and, benevento, in, the, meantime, the, ghibelline, city, of, ferrara, had, fallen, and, frederick, swept, his, way, northwards, capturing, ravenna, and, after, another, long, siege, faenza, the, people, of, forl, which, had, kept, its, ghibelline, stance, even, after, the, collapse, of, hohenstaufen, power, offered, their, loyal, support, during, the, capture, of, the, rival, city, as, a, sign, of, gratitude, they, were, granted, an, augmentation, of, the, communal, coat, of, arms, with, the, hohenstaufen, eagle, together, with, other, privileges, this, episode, shows, how, the, independent, cities, used, the, rivalry, between, empire, and, pope, as, a, means, to, obtain, maximum, advantage, for, themselves, at, this, time, gregory, considered, yielding, a, truce, occurred, and, peace, negotiations, began, direct, peace, negotiations, ultimately, failed, and, gregory, called, for, a, general, council, frederick, and, his, allies, however, dashed, gregory, s, plan, for, a, general, council, when, they, intercepted, a, delegation, of, prelates, traveling, to, rome, in, a, genoese, fleet, at, the, battle, of, giglio, 1241, frederick, then, directed, his, army, toward, rome, and, the, pope, burning, and, destroying, umbria, as, he, advanced, then, just, as, the, emperor, s, forces, were, ready, to, attack, rome, gregory, died, on, 22, august, 1241, frederick, then, attempted, to, show, that, the, war, was, not, directed, against, the, church, of, rome, but, against, the, pope, by, withdrawing, his, troops, and, freeing, from, prison, in, capua, two, cardinals, he, had, captured, at, giglio, otto, of, tonengo, and, james, of, pecorara, frederick, then, traveled, to, sicily, to, wait, for, the, election, of, a, new, pope, in, 1241, 1242, the, forces, of, the, mongol, empire, decisively, defeated, the, armies, of, hungary, and, poland, and, devastated, their, countryside, and, all, their, unfortified, settlements, king, b, la, iv, of, hungary, appealed, to, frederick, for, aid, but, frederick, being, in, dispute, with, the, hungarian, king, for, some, time, as, bela, had, sided, with, the, papacy, against, him, and, not, wanting, to, commit, to, a, major, military, expedition, so, readily, refused, he, was, unwilling, to, cross, into, hungary, and, although, he, went, about, unifying, his, magnates, and, other, monarchs, to, potentially, face, a, mongol, invasion, he, specifically, took, his, vow, for, the, defense, of, the, empire, on, this, side, of, the, alps, frederick, was, aware, of, the, danger, the, mongols, posed, and, grimly, assessed, the, situation, but, also, tried, to, use, it, as, leverage, over, the, papacy, to, frame, himself, as, the, protector, of, christendom, while, he, called, them, traitorous, pagans, frederick, expressed, an, admiration, for, mongol, military, prowess, after, hearing, of, their, deeds, in, particular, their, able, commanders, and, fierce, discipline, and, obedience, judging, the, latter, to, be, the, greatest, source, of, their, success, he, called, a, levy, throughout, germany, while, the, mongols, were, busy, raiding, hungary, in, mid, 1241, frederick, dispersed, his, army, back, to, their, holdfasts, as, the, mongols, preoccupied, themselves, with, the, lands, east, of, the, danube, attempting, to, smash, all, hungarian, resistance, he, subsequently, ordered, his, vassals, to, strengthen, their, defenses, adopt, a, defensive, posture, and, gather, large, numbers, of, crossbowmen, a, chronicler, reports, that, frederick, received, a, demand, of, submission, from, batu, khan, at, some, time, which, he, ignored, he, apparently, kept, up, to, date, on, the, mongols, activities, as, a, letter, from, frederick, ii, dated, june, 1241, comments, that, the, mongols, were, now, using, looted, hungarian, armor, a, letter, written, by, emperor, frederick, ii, found, in, the, regesta, imperii, dated, to, 20, june, 1241, and, intended, for, all, his, vassals, in, swabia, austria, and, bohemia, included, a, number, of, specific, military, instructions, his, forces, were, to, avoid, engaging, the, mongols, in, field, battles, hoard, all, food, stocks, in, every, fortress, and, stronghold, and, arm, all, possible, levies, as, well, as, the, general, populace, thomas, of, split, comments, that, there, was, a, frenzy, of, fortifying, castles, and, cities, throughout, the, holy, roman, empire, including, italy, either, following, the, emperor, s, instructions, or, on, their, own, initiative, frederick, ii, duke, of, austria, paid, to, have, his, border, castles, strengthened, at, his, own, expense, king, wenceslaus, i, of, bohemia, had, every, castle, strengthened, and, provisioned, as, well, as, providing, soldiers, and, armaments, to, monasteries, in, order, to, turn, them, into, refuges, for, the, civilian, population, mongol, probing, attacks, materialised, on, the, holy, roman, empire, s, border, states, a, force, was, repulsed, in, a, skirmish, near, k, odzko, 300, 700, mongol, troops, were, killed, in, a, battle, near, vienna, to, 100, austrian, losses, according, to, the, duke, of, austria, and, a, mongol, raiding, party, was, destroyed, by, austrian, knights, in, the, district, of, theben, after, being, backed, to, the, border, of, the, river, march, as, the, holy, roman, empire, seemed, now, the, target, of, the, mongols, frederick, ii, sent, letters, to, henry, iii, of, england, and, louis, ix, of, france, in, order, to, organise, a, crusade, against, the, mongol, empire, a, full, scale, invasion, never, occurred, as, the, mongols, spent, the, next, year, pillaging, hungary, before, withdrawing, after, the, mongols, withdrew, from, hungary, back, to, russia, frederick, turned, his, attention, back, towards, italian, matters, the, danger, represented, by, the, presence, of, the, mongols, in, europe, was, debated, again, at, the, first, council, of, lyon, in, 1245, but, frederick, ii, was, excommunicated, by, that, very, diet, in, the, context, of, his, struggle, with, the, papacy, and, ultimately, abandoned, the, possibility, of, a, crusade, against, the, mongol, empire, a, new, pope, innocent, iv, was, elected, on, 25, june, 1243, he, was, a, member, of, a, noble, imperial, family, and, had, some, relatives, in, frederick, s, camp, so, the, emperor, was, initially, happy, with, his, election, innocent, however, was, to, become, his, fiercest, enemy, negotiations, began, in, the, summer, of, 1243, but, the, situation, changed, as, viterbo, rebelled, instigated, by, the, intriguing, local, cardinal, ranieri, capocci, frederick, could, not, afford, to, lose, his, main, stronghold, near, rome, so, he, besieged, viterbo, innocent, convinced, the, rebels, to, sign, a, peace, but, after, frederick, withdrew, his, garrison, ranieri, had, them, slaughtered, on, 13, november, frederick, was, enraged, the, new, pope, was, a, master, diplomat, and, frederick, signed, a, peace, treaty, which, was, soon, broken, innocent, together, with, most, of, the, cardinals, fled, via, genoese, galleys, to, liguria, arriving, on, 7, july, his, aim, was, to, reach, lyon, where, a, new, council, was, being, held, since, 24, june, 1245, despite, initially, appearing, that, the, council, could, end, with, a, compromise, the, intervention, of, ranieri, who, had, a, series, of, insulting, pamphlets, published, against, frederick, in, which, among, other, things, he, defined, the, emperor, as, a, heretic, and, an, antichrist, led, the, prelates, towards, a, less, accommodating, solution, one, month, later, innocent, iv, declared, frederick, to, be, deposed, as, emperor, characterising, him, as, a, friend, of, babylon, s, sultan, of, saracen, customs, provided, with, a, harem, guarded, by, eunuchs, like, the, schismatic, emperor, of, byzantium, and, in, sum, a, heretic, the, pope, backed, heinrich, raspe, landgrave, of, thuringia, as, rival, for, the, imperial, crown, and, set, in, motion, a, plot, to, kill, frederick, and, enzo, with, the, support, of, the, pope, s, brother, in, law, orlando, de, rossi, another, friend, of, frederick, the, plotters, were, unmasked, by, the, count, of, caserta, however, and, the, city, of, altavilla, where, they, had, found, shelter, was, razed, the, guilty, were, blinded, mutilated, and, burnt, alive, or, hanged, an, attempt, to, invade, the, kingdom, of, sicily, under, the, command, of, ranieri, was, halted, at, spello, by, marino, of, eboli, imperial, vicar, of, spoleto, innocent, also, sent, a, flow, of, money, to, germany, to, cut, off, frederick, s, power, at, its, source, the, archbishops, of, cologne, and, mainz, also, declared, frederick, deposed, and, in, may, 1246, heinrich, raspe, was, chosen, as, the, new, king, on, 5, august, 1246, heinrich, thanks, to, the, pope, s, money, managed, to, defeat, an, army, of, conrad, son, of, frederick, near, frankfurt, frederick, strengthened, his, position, in, southern, germany, however, acquiring, the, duchy, of, austria, whose, duke, had, died, without, heirs, a, year, later, heinrich, died, and, the, new, anti, king, was, william, ii, of, holland, between, february, and, march, 1247, frederick, settled, the, situation, in, italy, by, means, of, the, diet, of, terni, naming, his, relatives, or, friends, as, vicars, of, the, various, lands, he, married, his, son, manfred, to, the, daughter, of, amedeo, di, savoia, and, secured, the, submission, of, the, marquis, of, monferrato, on, his, part, innocent, asked, protection, from, the, king, of, france, louis, ix, but, the, king, was, a, friend, of, the, emperor, and, believed, in, his, desire, for, peace, a, papal, army, under, the, command, of, ottaviano, degli, ubaldini, never, reached, lombardy, and, the, emperor, accompanied, by, a, massive, army, held, the, next, diet, in, turin, an, unexpected, event, was, to, change, the, situation, dramatically, in, june, 1247, the, important, lombard, city, of, parma, expelled, the, imperial, functionaries, and, sided, with, the, guelphs, enzo, was, not, in, the, city, and, could, do, nothing, more, than, ask, for, help, from, his, father, who, came, back, to, lay, siege, to, the, rebels, together, with, his, friend, ezzelino, iii, da, romano, tyrant, of, verona, the, besieged, languished, as, the, emperor, waited, for, them, to, surrender, from, starvation, he, had, a, wooden, city, which, he, called, vittoria, built, around, the, walls, on, 18, february, 1248, during, one, of, these, absences, the, camp, was, suddenly, assaulted, and, taken, and, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, parma, the, imperial, side, was, routed, frederick, lost, the, imperial, treasure, and, with, it, any, hope, of, maintaining, the, impetus, of, his, struggle, against, the, rebellious, communes, and, against, the, pope, who, began, plans, for, a, crusade, against, sicily, frederick, soon, recovered, and, rebuilt, an, army, but, this, defeat, encouraged, resistance, in, many, cities, that, could, no, longer, bear, the, fiscal, burden, of, his, regime, romagna, marche, and, spoleto, were, lost, in, february, 1249, frederick, fired, his, advisor, and, prime, minister, the, famous, jurist, and, poet, pier, delle, vigne, on, charges, of, peculation, and, embezzlement, some, historians, suggest, that, pier, was, planning, to, betray, the, emperor, who, according, to, matthew, of, paris, cried, when, he, discovered, the, plot, pier, blinded, and, in, chains, died, in, pisa, possibly, by, his, own, hand, even, more, shocking, for, frederick, was, the, capture, of, his, natural, son, enzo, of, sardinia, by, the, bolognese, at, the, battle, of, fossalta, in, may, 1249, enzo, was, held, in, a, palace, in, bologna, where, he, remained, captive, until, his, death, in, 1272, frederick, lost, another, son, richard, of, chieti, the, struggle, continued, the, empire, lost, como, and, modena, but, regained, ravenna,

of, that, year, the, indomitable, ranieri, of, viterbo, died, and, the, imperial, condottieri, again, reconquered, romagna, the, marche, and, spoleto, and, conrad, king, of, the, romans, scored, several, victories, in, germany, against, william, of, holland, frederick, did, not, take, part, in, of, any, of, these, campaigns, he, had, been, ill, and, likely, felt, tired, despite, the, betrayals, and, the, setbacks, he, had, faced, in, his, last, years, frederick, died, peacefully, wearing, the, habit, of, a, cistercian, monk, on, 13, december, 1250, in, castel, fiorentino, territory, of, torremaggiore, in, apulia, after, an, attack, of, dysentery, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, preeminent, position, in, europe, was, challenged, but, not, lost, his, testament, left, his, legitimate, son, conrad, the, imperial, and, sicilian, crowns, manfred, received, the, principality, of, taranto, and, regency, over, the, kingdom, of, sicily, while, his, half, brother, remained, in, germany, henry, received, the, kingdom, of, arles, or, that, of, jerusalem, while, the, son, of, henry, vii, was, entrusted, with, the, duchy, of, austria, and, the, march, of, styria, frederick, s, will, stipulated, that, all, the, lands, he, had, taken, from, the, church, were, to, be, returned, to, it, all, the, prisoners, freed, and, the, taxes, reduced, provided, this, did, not, damage, the, empire, s, prestige, however, upon, conrad, s, death, a, mere, four, years, later, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, fell, from, power, and, the, great, interregnum, began, lasting, until, 1273, one, year, after, the, last, hohenstaufen, enzo, had, died, in, his, prison, during, this, time, a, legend, developed, that, frederick, was, not, truly, dead, but, merely, sleeping, in, the, kyffh, user, mountains, and, would, one, day, awaken, to, reestablish, his, empire, over, time, this, legend, largely, transferred, itself, to, his, grandfather, frederick, i, also, known, as, barbarossa, redbeard, his, sarcophagus, made, of, red, porphyry, lies, in, the, cathedral, of, palermo, beside, those, of, his, parents, henry, vi, and, constance, as, well, as, his, grandfather, the, norman, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, he, is, wearing, a, funerary, alb, with, a, thuluth, style, inscribed, cuff, a, bust, of, frederick, sits, in, the, walhalla, temple, built, by, ludwig, i, of, bavaria, his, sarcophagus, was, opened, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, various, items, can, be, found, in, the, british, museum, s, collection, including, a, small, piece, of, funerary, crown, frederick, s, contemporaries, called, him, stupor, mundi, the, astonishment, of, the, world, the, majority, of, his, contemporaries, were, indeed, astonished, and, sometimes, repelled, by, the, pronounced, unorthodoxy, of, the, hohenstaufen, emperor, and, his, temperamental, stubbornness, maehl, argues, that, frederick, inherited, german, norman, and, sicilian, blood, but, by, training, lifestyle, and, temperament, he, was, most, of, all, sicilian, to, the, end, of, his, life, he, remained, above, all, a, sicilian, grand, signore, and, his, whole, imperial, policy, aimed, at, expanding, the, sicilian, kingdom, into, italy, rather, than, the, german, kingdom, southward, and, according, to, cantor, frederick, had, no, intention, of, giving, up, naples, and, sicily, which, were, the, real, strongholds, of, its, power, he, was, in, fact, uninterested, in, germany, frederick, was, a, religious, sceptic, to, an, extent, unusual, for, his, era, his, papal, enemies, used, it, against, him, at, every, turn, pope, innocent, iv, declared, him, preambulus, antichristi, predecessor, of, the, antichrist, on, july, 17, 1245, as, frederick, allegedly, did, not, respect, the, privilegium, potestatis, of, the, church, he, was, excommunicated, his, rationalistic, mind, took, pleasure, in, the, strictly, logical, character, of, christian, dogma, he, was, not, however, a, champion, of, rationalism, nor, had, he, any, sympathy, with, the, mystico, heretical, movements, of, the, time, in, fact, he, joined, in, suppressing, them, it, was, not, the, church, of, the, middle, ages, that, he, antagonized, but, its, representatives, for, his, supposed, epicureanism, paganism, frederick, ii, is, listed, as, a, representative, member, of, the, sixth, region, of, dante, s, inferno, that, of, the, heretics, who, are, burned, in, tombs, worried, by, the, independent, rule, the, muslim, population, developed, since, his, departure, in, 1212, he, deported, the, muslim, population, of, sicily, to, lucera, on, mainland, italy, in, 1220, in, lucera, he, assumed, surveillance, was, better, in, order, to, control, them, and, the, muslims, acknowledged, that, they, were, left, with, their, religious, freedom, he, also, enlisted, some, in, the, army, and, six, hundred, as, his, personal, bodyguards, because, as, muslim, soldiers, they, had, the, advantage, of, immunity, from, papal, excommunication, frederick, had, a, great, thirst, for, knowledge, and, learning, frederick, employed, jews, from, sicily, who, had, migrated, there, from, the, holy, land, at, his, court, to, translate, greek, and, arabic, works, he, also, introduced, paper, into, a, european, court, he, played, a, major, role, in, promoting, literature, through, the, sicilian, school, of, poetry, his, sicilian, royal, court, in, palermo, saw, the, first, use, of, a, literary, form, of, an, italo, romance, language, sicilian, through, the, mix, of, arabic, hebrew, latin, greek, and, sicilian, language, poems, and, art, at, the, court, arabic, muwashshahat, or, girdle, poems, influenced, the, birth, of, the, sonnet, the, language, developed, by, giacomo, da, lentini, and, pier, delle, vigne, in, the, sicilian, school, of, poetry, gathering, around, frederick, ii, of, swabia, in, the, first, half, of, the, thirteenth, century, had, a, decisive, influence, on, dante, alighieri, and, then, on, the, development, of, italian, language, itself, the, school, and, its, poetry, were, saluted, by, dante, and, his, peers, and, predate, by, at, least, a, century, the, use, of, the, tuscan, idiom, as, the, elite, literary, language, of, italy, frederick, ii, is, the, author, of, the, first, treatise, on, the, subject, of, falconry, de, arte, venandi, cum, avibus, the, art, of, hunting, with, birds, in, the, words, of, the, historian, charles, homer, haskins, it, is, a, scientific, book, approaching, the, subject, from, aristotle, but, based, closely, on, observation, and, experiment, throughout, divisivus, et, inquisitivus, in, the, words, of, the, preface, it, is, at, the, same, time, a, scholastic, book, minute, and, almost, mechanical, in, its, divisions, and, subdivisions, it, is, also, a, rigidly, practical, book, written, by, a, falconer, for, falconers, and, condensing, a, long, experience, into, systematic, form, for, the, use, of, others, for, this, book, he, drew, from, sources, in, the, arabic, language, frederick, s, pride, in, his, mastery, of, the, art, is, illustrated, by, the, story, that, when, he, was, ordered, to, become, a, subject, of, the, great, khan, batu, and, receive, an, office, at, the, khan, s, court, he, remarked, that, he, would, make, a, good, falconer, for, he, understood, birds, very, well, he, maintained, up, to, fifty, falconers, at, a, time, in, his, court, and, in, his, letters, he, requested, arctic, gyrfalcons, from, l, beck, and, even, from, greenland, one, of, the, two, existing, versions, was, modified, by, his, son, manfred, also, a, keen, falconer, david, attenborough, in, natural, curiosities, notes, that, frederick, fully, understood, the, migration, of, some, birds, at, a, time, when, all, sorts, of, now, improbable, theories, were, common, frederick, loved, exotic, animals, in, general, his, menagerie, with, which, he, impressed, the, cold, cities, of, northern, italy, and, europe, included, hounds, giraffes, cheetahs, lynxes, leopards, exotic, birds, and, an, elephant, he, was, also, alleged, to, have, carried, out, a, number, of, experiments, on, people, these, experiments, were, recorded, by, the, monk, salimbene, di, adam, in, his, chronicles, among, the, experiments, were, shutting, a, prisoner, up, in, a, cask, to, see, if, the, soul, could, be, observed, escaping, through, a, hole, in, the, cask, when, the, prisoner, died, feeding, two, prisoners, having, sent, one, out, to, hunt, and, the, other, to, bed, and, then, having, them, disemboweled, to, see, which, had, digested, his, meal, better, imprisoning, children, and, then, denying, them, any, human, contact, to, see, if, they, would, develop, a, natural, language, in, the,

frederick, bade, foster, mothers, and, nurses, to, suckle, and, bathe, and, wash, the, children, but, in, no, ways, to, prattle, or, speak, with, them, for, he, would, have, learnt, whether, they, would, speak, the, hebrew, language, which, had, been, the, first, or, greek, or, latin, or, arabic, or, perchance, the, tongue, of, their, parents, of, whom, they, had, been, born, but, he, laboured, in, vain, for, the, children, could, not, live, without, clappings, of, the, hands, and, gestures, and, gladness, of, countenance, and, blandishments, frederick, was, also, interested, in, the, stars, and, his, court, was, host, to, many, astrologers, and, astronomers, including, michael, scot, and, guido, bonatti, he, often, sent, letters, to, the, leading, scholars, of, the, time, not, only, in,

the, occupations, of, physician, and, apothecary, physicians, were, forbidden, to, double, as, pharmacists, and, the, prices, of, various, medicinal, remedies, were, fixed, this, became, a, model, for, regulation, of, the, practice, of, pharmacy, throughout, europe, he, was, not, able, to, extend, his, legal, reforms, beyond, sicily, to, the, empire, in, 1232, he, was, forced, by, the, german, princes, to, promulgate, the, statutum, in, favorem, principum, statute, in, favor, of, princes, it, was, a, charter, of, liberties, for, the, leading, german, princes, at, the, expense, of, the, lesser, nobility, and, the, entirety, of, the, commoners, the, princes, gained, whole, power, of, jurisdiction, and, the, power, to, strike, their, own, coins, the, emperor, lost, his, right, to, establish, new, cities, castles, and, mints, over, their, territories, the, statutum, severely, weakened, central, authority, in, germany, from, 1232, the, vassals, of, the, emperor, had, a, veto, over, imperial, legislative, decisions, every, new, law, established, by, the, emperor, had, to, be, approved, by, the, princes, historians, rate, frederick, ii, as, a, highly, significant, european, monarch, of, the, middle, ages, this, reputation, was, present, even, in, frederick, s, era, lansing, and, english, two, british, historians, argue, that, medieval, palermo, has, been, overlooked, in, favor, of, paris, and, london, one, effect, of, this, approach, has, been, to, privilege, historical, winners, aspects, of, medieval, europe, that, became, important, in, later, centuries, above, all, the, nation, state, arguably, the, liveliest, cultural, innovation, in, the, 13th, century, was, mediterranean, centered, on, frederick, ii, s, polyglot, court, and, administration, in, palermo, sicily, and, the, italian, south, in, later, centuries, suffered, a, long, slide, into, overtaxed, poverty, and, marginality, textbook, narratives, therefore, focus, not, on, medieval, palermo, with, its, muslim, and, jewish, bureaucracies, and, arabic, speaking, monarch, but, on, the, historical, winners, paris, and, london, modern, medievalists, no, longer, accept, the, notion, sponsored, by, the, popes, of, frederick, as, an, anti, christian, they, argue, that, frederick, understood, himself, as, a, christian, monarch, in, the, sense, of, a, byzantine, emperor, thus, as, god, s, viceroy, on, earth, whatever, his, personal, feelings, toward, religion, certainly, submission, to, the, pope, did, not, enter, into, the, matter, in, the, slightest, this, was, in, line, with, the, hohenstaufen, kaiser, idee, the, ideology, claiming, the, holy, roman, emperor, to, be, the, legitimate, successor, to, the, roman, emperors, as, his, father, henry, vi, frederick, established, a, cosmopolitan, court, such, as, with, the, black, treasury, custodian, johannes, morus, and, depiction, of, the, different, peoples, under, their, rule, which, persisted, throughout, the, starting, late, middle, ages, 21, century, treatments, of, frederick, vary, from, the, sober, wolfgang, st, rner, to, the, dramatic, ernst, kantorowicz, however, all, agree, on, frederick, ii, s, significance, as, holy, roman, emperor, in, the, judgment, of, british, historian, geoffrey, barraclough, frederick, s, extensive, concessions, to, german, princes, which, he, made, in, the, hopes, of, securing, his, base, for, his, italian, projects, undid, the, political, power, of, his, predecessors, and, postponed, german, unity, for, centuries, the, modern, approach, to, frederick, ii, tends, to, be, focused, on, the, continuity, between, frederick, and, his, predecessors, as, kings, of, sicily, and, holy, roman, emperors, and, the, similarities, between, him, and, other, thirteenth, century, monarchs, david, abulafia, in, a, biography, subtitled, a, medieval, emperor, argues, that, frederick, s, reputation, as, an, enlightened, figure, ahead, of, his, time, is, undeserved, and, that, frederick, was, mostly, a, conventionally, christian, monarch, who, sought, to, rule, in, a, conventional, medieval, manner, nietzsche, a, prominent, philosopher, mentioned, frederick, in, his, book, beyond, good, and, evil, part, v, aphorism, 200, nietzsche, seems, to, admire, frederick, for, resisting, the, conventional, morals, of, his, time, and, having, the, courage, to, create, his, own, moral, code, to, live, by, he, compares, frederick, to, figures, like, caesar, and, leonardo, da, vinci, both, of, whom, he, sees, as, embodying, strong, individualism, and, most, importantly, the, will, to, power, which, nietzsche, believed, to, be, the, very, core, of, human, greatness, frederick, left, numerous, children, legitimate, and, illegitimate, first, wife, constance, of, aragon,

1225, one, source, states, that, it, lasted, 20, years, they, had, three, children, matthew, of, paris, relates, the, story, of, a, marriage, confirmatio, matrimonii, in, articulo, mortis, on, her, deathbed, between, them, when, bianca, was, dying, but, this, marriage, was, never, recognized, by, the, church, nevertheless, bianca, s, children, were, apparently, regarded, by, frederick, as,
