nomadic, conquerors, of, the, eurasian, steppe, and, his, empire, set, the, stage, for, the, rise, of, the, more, structured, and, lasting, islamic, gunpowder, empires, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, timur, was, of, both, turkic, and, mongol, descent, and, while, probably, not, a, direct, descendant, on, either, side, he, shared, a, common, ancestor, with, genghis, khan, on, his, father, s, side, though, some, authors, have, suggested, his, mother, may, have, been, a, descendant, of, the, khan, he, clearly, sought, to, invoke, the, legacy, of, genghis, khan, s, conquests, during, his, lifetime, timur, envisioned, the, restoration, of, the, mongol, empire, and, according, to, g, rard, chaliand, saw, himself, as, genghis, khan, s, heir, to, legitimize, his, conquests, timur, relied, on, islamic, symbols, and, language, referring, to, himself, as, the, sword, of, islam, he, was, a, patron, of, educational, and, religious, institutions, he, styled, himself, as, a, ghazi, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, by, the, end, of, his, reign, timur, had, gained, complete, control, over, all, the, remnants, of, the, chagatai, khanate, the, ilkhanate, and, the, golden, horde, and, had, even, attempted, to, restore, the, yuan, dynasty, in, china, timur, s, armies, were, inclusively, multi, ethnic, and, were, feared, throughout, asia, africa, and, europe, sizable, parts, of, which, his, campaigns, laid, waste, scholars, estimate, that, his, military, campaigns, caused, the, deaths, of, millions, of, people, of, all, the, areas, he, conquered, khwarazm, suffered, the, most, from, his, expeditions, as, it, rose, several, times, against, him, timur, s, campaigns, have, been, characterized, as, genocidal, he, was, the, grandfather, of, the, timurid, sultan, astronomer, and, mathematician, ulugh, beg, who, ruled, central, asia, from, 1411, to, 1449, and, the, great, great, great, grandfather, of, babur, 1483, 1530, founder, of, the, mughal, empire, through, his, father, timur, claimed, to, be, a, descendant, of, tumbinai, khan, a, male, line, ancestor, he, shared, with, genghis, khan, tumanay, s, great, great, grandson, qarachar, noyan, was, a, minister, for, the, emperor, who, later, assisted, the, latter, s, son, chagatai, in, the, governorship, of, transoxiana, though, there, are, not, many, mentions, of, qarachar, in, 13th, and, 14th, century, records, later, timurid, sources, greatly, emphasized, his, role, in, the, early, history, of, the, mongol, empire, these, histories, also, state, that, genghis, khan, later, established, the, bond, of, fatherhood, and, sonship, by, marrying, chagatai, s, daughter, to, qarachar, through, his, alleged, descent, from, this, marriage, timur, claimed, kinship, with, the, chagatai, khans, the, origins, of, timur, s, mother, tekina, khatun, are, less, clear, the, zafarnama, merely, states, her, name, without, giving, any, information, regarding, her, background, writing, in, 1403, john, iii, archbishop, of, sultaniyya, claimed, that, she, was, of, lowly, origin, the, mu, izz, al, ansab, written, decades, later, says, that, she, was, related, to, the, yasa, uri, tribe, whose, lands, bordered, that, of, the, barlas, ibn, khaldun, recounted, that, timur, himself, described, to, him, his, mother, s, descent, from, the, legendary, persian, hero, manuchehr, ibn, arabshah, suggested, that, she, was, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, the, 18th, century, books, of, timur, identify, her, as, the, daughter, of, sadr, al, sharia, which, is, believed, to, refer, to, the, hanafi, scholar, ubayd, allah, al, mahbubi, of, bukhara, timur, was, born, in, transoxiana, near, the, city, of, kesh, modern, shahrisabz, uzbekistan, some, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, south, of, samarkand, part, of, what, was, then, the, chagatai, khanate, his, name, temur, means, iron, in, the, chagatai, language, his, mother, tongue, cf, uzbek, temir, turkish, demir, it, is, cognate, with, genghis, khan, s, birth, name, of, tem, jin, later, timurid, dynastic, histories, claim, that, timur, was, born, on, 8, april, 1336, but, most, sources, from, his, lifetime, give, ages, that, are, consistent, with, a, birthdate, in, the, late, 1320s, historian, beatrice, forbes, manz, suspects, the, 1336, date, was, designed, to, tie, timur, to, the, legacy, of, abu, sa, id, bahadur, khan, the, last, ruler, of, the, ilkhanate, descended, from, hulagu, khan, who, died, in, that, year, he, was, a, member, of, the, barlas, a, mongolian, tribe, that, had, been, turkified, in, many, aspects, his, father, taraghai, was, described, as, a, minor, noble, of, this, tribe, however, manz, believes, that, timur, may, have, later, understated, the, social, position, of, his, father, so, as, to, make, his, own, successes, appear, more, remarkable, she, states, that, though, he, is, not, believed, to, have, been, especially, powerful, taraghai, was, reasonably, wealthy, and, influential, 116, this, is, shown, in, the, zafarnama, which, states, that, timur, later, returning, to, his, birthplace, following, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1360, suggesting, concern, over, his, estate, taraghai, s, social, significance, is, further, hinted, at, by, arabshah, who, described, him, as, a, magnate, in, the, court, of, amir, husayn, qara, unas, in, addition, to, this, the, father, of, the, great, amir, hamid, kereyid, of, moghulistan, is, stated, as, a, friend, of, taraghai, s, in, his, childhood, timur, and, a, small, band, of, followers, raided, travelers, for, goods, especially, animals, such, as, sheep, horses, and, cattle, 116, around, 1363, it, is, believed, that, timur, tried, to, steal, a, sheep, from, a, shepherd, but, was, shot, by, two, arrows, one, in, his, right, leg, and, another, in, his, right, hand, where, he, lost, two, fingers, both, injuries, disabled, him, for, life, some, believe, that, these, injuries, occurred, while, serving, as, a, mercenary, to, the, khan, of, sistan, in, what, is, today, the, dashti, margo, in, southwest, afghanistan, timur, s, injuries, and, disability, gave, rise, to, the, nickname, timur, the, lame, or, tem, r, i, lang, in, persian, which, is, the, origin, of, tamerlane, the, name, by, which, he, is, generally, known, in, the, west, persia, tokhtamysh, timur, war, georgia, north, caucasia, india, levant, anatolia, by, about, 1360, timur, had, gained, prominence, as, a, military, leader, whose, troops, were, mostly, turkic, tribesmen, of, the, region, he, took, part, in, campaigns, in, transoxiana, with, the, khan, of, the, chagatai, khanate, allying, himself, both, in, cause, and, by, family, connection, with, qazaghan, the, dethroner, and, destroyer, of, volga, bulgaria, he, invaded, khorasan, at, the, head, of, a, thousand, horsemen, this, was, the, second, military, expedition, that, he, led, and, its, success, led, to, further, operations, among, them, the, subjugation, of, khwarazm, and, urgench, following, qazaghan, s, murder, disputes, arose, among, the, many, claimants, to, sovereign, power, tughlugh, timur, of, kashgar, the, khan, of, the, eastern, chagatai, khanate, another, descendant, of, genghis, khan, invaded, interrupting, this, infighting, timur, was, sent, to, negotiate, with, the, invader, but, joined, with, him, instead, and, was, rewarded, with, transoxania, at, about, this, time, his, father, died, and, timur, also, became, chief, of, the, barlas, tughlugh, then, attempted, to, set, his, son, ilyas, khoja, over, transoxania, but, timur, repelled, this, invasion, with, a, smaller, force, in, this, period, timur, reduced, the, chagatai, khans, to, the, position, of, figureheads, while, he, ruled, in, their, name, also, during, this, period, timur, and, his, brother, in, law, amir, husayn, who, were, at, first, fellow, fugitives, and, wanderers, became, rivals, and, antagonists, the, relationship, between, them, became, strained, after, husayn, abandoned, efforts, to, carry, out, timur, s, orders, to, finish, off, ilya, khoja, former, governor, of, mawarannah, close, to, tashkent, timur, gained, followers, in, balkh, consisting, of, merchants, fellow, tribesmen, muslim, clergy, aristocracy, and, agricultural, workers, because, of, his, kindness, in, sharing, his, belongings, with, them, this, contrasted, timur, s, behavior, with, that, of, husayn, who, alienated, these, people, took, many, possessions, from, them, via, his, heavy, tax, laws, and, selfishly, spent, the, tax, money, building, elaborate, structures, around, 1370, husayn, surrendered, to, timur, and, was, later, assassinated, which, allowed, timur, to, be, formally, proclaimed, sovereign, at, balkh, he, married, husayn, s, wife, saray, mulk, khanum, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, allowing, him, to, become, imperial, ruler, of, the, chaghatay, tribe, timur, s, turco, mongolian, heritage, provided, opportunities, and, challenges, as, he, sought, to, rule, the, mongol, empire, and, the, muslim, world, according, to, the, mongol, traditions, timur, could, not, claim, the, title, of, khan, or, rule, the, mongol, empire, because, he, was, not, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, therefore, timur, set, up, a, puppet, chaghatayid, khan, suyurghatmish, as, the, nominal, ruler, of, balkh, as, he, pretended, to, act, as, a, protector, of, the, member, of, a, chinggisid, line, that, of, genghis, khan, s, eldest, son, jochi, timur, instead, used, the, title, of, amir, meaning, general, and, acting, in, the, name, of, the, chagatai, ruler, of, transoxania, 106, to, reinforce, this, position, timur, claimed, the, title, g, regen, royal, son, in, law, to, a, princess, of, chinggisid, line, as, with, the, title, of, khan, timur, similarly, could, not, claim, the, supreme, title, of, the, islamic, world, caliph, because, the, office, was, limited, to, the, quraysh, the, tribe, of, the, prophet, muhammad, therefore, timur, reacted, to, the, challenge, by, creating, a, myth, and, image, of, himself, as, a, supernatural, personal, power, ordained, by, god, timur, s, most, famous, title, was, sahib, qiran, lord, of, conjunction, which, is, rooted, in, astrology, a, title, that, was, used, before, him, to, designate, hamza, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, the, paternal, uncle, of, muhammad, and, which, was, taken, by, the, mamluk, sultan, baybars, and, by, various, rulers, of, the, ilkhanate, to, designate, themselves, in, that, regard, he, simply, pursued, an, existing, tradition, in, the, muslim, world, to, designate, conquerors, the, title, was, referring, to, the, conjunction, of, the, two, superior, planets, saturn, and, jupiter, which, was, held, to, be, an, auspicious, sign, and, the, mark, of, a, new, era, according, to, a, azfar, moin, sahib, qiran, was, a, messianic, title, implying, that, timur, might, potentially, be, the, awaited, messiah, descended, from, the, prophetic, line, who, would, inaugurate, a, new, era, possibly, the, last, one, before, the, end, of, time, otherwise, he, depicted, himself, as, a, spiritual, descendant, of, ali, thus, claiming, the, lineage, of, both, genghis, khan, and, the, quraysh, timur, spent, the, next, 35, years, in, various, wars, and, expeditions, he, not, only, consolidated, his, rule, at, home, by, the, subjugation, of, his, foes, but, sought, extension, of, territory, by, encroachments, upon, the, lands, of, foreign, potentates, his, conquests, to, the, west, and, northwest, led, him, to, the, lands, near, the, caspian, sea, and, to, the, banks, of, the, ural, and, the, volga, conquests, in, the, south, and, south, west, encompassed, almost, every, province, in, persia, including, baghdad, karbala, and, northern, iraq, one, of, the, most, formidable, of, timur, s, opponents, was, another, mongol, ruler, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, named, tokhtamysh, after, having, been, a, refugee, in, timur, s, court, tokhtamysh, became, ruler, both, of, the, eastern, kipchak, and, the, golden, horde, after, his, accession, he, quarreled, with, timur, over, the, possession, of, khwarizm, and, azerbaijan, however, timur, still, supported, him, against, the, russians, and, in, 1382, tokhtamysh, invaded, the, muscovite, dominion, and, burned, moscow, russian, orthodox, tradition, states, that, later, in, 1395, having, reached, the, frontier, of, the, principality, of, ryazan, timur, had, taken, yelets, and, started, advancing, towards, moscow, vasily, i, of, moscow, went, with, an, army, to, kolomna, and, halted, at, the, banks, of, the, oka, river, the, clergy, brought, the, famed, theotokos, of, vladimir, icon, from, vladimir, to, moscow, along, the, way, people, prayed, kneeling, o, mother, of, god, save, the, land, of, russia, suddenly, timur, s, armies, retreated, in, memory, of, this, miraculous, deliverance, of, the, russian, land, from, timur, on, 26, august, the, all, russian, celebration, in, honor, of, the, meeting, of, the, vladimir, icon, of, the, most, holy, mother, of, god, was, established, after, the, death, of, abu, sa, id, ruler, of, the, ilkhanate, in, 1335, there, was, a, power, vacuum, in, persia, in, the, end, persia, was, split, amongst, the, muzaffarids, kartids, eretnids, chobanids, injuids, jalayirids, and, sarbadars, in, 1383, timur, started, his, lengthy, military, conquest, of, persia, though, he, already, ruled, over, much, of, persian, khorasan, by, 1381, after, khwaja, mas, ud, of, the, sarbadar, dynasty, surrendered, timur, began, his, persian, campaign, with, herat, capital, of, the, kartid, dynasty, when, herat, did, not, surrender, he, reduced, the, city, to, rubble, and, massacred, most, of, its, citizens, it, remained, in, ruins, until, shah, rukh, ordered, its, reconstruction, around, 1415, timur, then, sent, a, general, to, capture, rebellious, kandahar, with, the, capture, of, herat, the, kartid, kingdom, surrendered, and, became, vassals, of, timur, it, would, later, be, annexed, outright, less, than, a, decade, later, in, 1389, by, timur, s, son, miran, shah, timur, then, headed, west, to, capture, the, zagros, mountains, passing, through, mazandaran, during, his, travel, through, the, north, of, persia, he, captured, the, then, town, of, tehran, which, surrendered, and, was, thus, treated, mercifully, he, laid, siege, to, soltaniyeh, in, 1384, khorasan, revolted, one, year, later, so, timur, destroyed, isfizar, and, the, prisoners, were, cemented, into, the, walls, alive, the, next, year, the, kingdom, of, sistan, under, the, mihrabanid, dynasty, was, ravaged, and, its, capital, at, zaranj, was, destroyed, timur, then, returned, to, his, capital, of, samarkand, where, he, began, planning, for, his, georgian, campaign, and, golden, horde, invasion, in, 1386, timur, passed, through, mazandaran, as, he, had, when, trying, to, capture, the, zagros, he, went, near, the, city, of, soltaniyeh, which, he, had, previously, captured, but, instead, turned, north, and, captured, tabriz, with, little, resistance, along, with, maragha, he, ordered, heavy, taxation, of, the, people, which, was, collected, by, adil, aqa, who, was, also, given, control, over, soltaniyeh, adil, was, later, executed, because, timur, suspected, him, of, corruption, timur, then, went, north, to, begin, his, georgian, and, golden, horde, campaigns, pausing, his, full, scale, invasion, of, persia, when, he, returned, he, found, his, generals, had, done, well, in, protecting, the, cities, and, lands, he, had, conquered, in, persia, though, many, rebelled, and, his, son, miran, shah, who, may, have, been, regent, was, forced, to, annex, rebellious, vassal, dynasties, his, holdings, remained, so, he, proceeded, to, capture, the, rest, of, persia, specifically, the, two, major, southern, cities, of, isfahan, and, shiraz, when, he, arrived, with, his, army, at, isfahan, in, 1387, the, city, immediately, surrendered, he, treated, it, with, relative, mercy, as, he, normally, did, with, cities, that, surrendered, unlike, herat, however, after, isfahan, revolted, against, timur, s, taxes, by, killing, the, tax, collectors, and, some, of, timur, s, soldiers, he, ordered, the, massacre, of, the, city, s, citizens, the, death, toll, is, reckoned, at, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, an, eye, witness, counted, more, than, 28, towers, constructed, of, about, 1, 500, heads, each, this, has, been, described, as, a, systematic, use, of, terror, against, towns, an, integral, element, of, tamerlane, s, strategic, element, which, he, viewed, as, preventing, bloodshed, by, discouraging, resistance, his, massacres, were, selective, and, he, spared, the, artistic, and, educated, this, would, later, influence, the, next, great, persian, conqueror, nader, shah, timur, then, began, a, five, year, campaign, to, the, west, in, 1392, attacking, persian, kurdistan, in, 1393, shiraz, was, captured, after, surrendering, and, the, muzaffarids, became, vassals, of, timur, though, prince, shah, mansur, rebelled, but, was, defeated, and, the, muzafarids, were, annexed, shortly, after, georgia, was, devastated, so, that, the, golden, horde, could, not, use, it, to, threaten, northern, iran, in, the, same, year, timur, caught, baghdad, by, surprise, in, august, by, marching, there, in, only, eight, days, from, shiraz, sultan, ahmad, jalayir, fled, to, syria, where, the, mamluk, sultan, barquq, protected, him, and, killed, timur, s, envoys, timur, left, the, sarbadar, prince, khwaja, mas, ud, to, govern, baghdad, but, he, was, driven, out, when, ahmad, jalayir, returned, ahmad, was, unpopular, but, got, help, from, qara, yusuf, of, the, kara, koyunlu, he, fled, again, in, 1399, this, time, to, the, ottomans, in, the, meantime, tokhtamysh, now, khan, of, the, golden, horde, turned, against, his, patron, and, in, 1385, invaded, azerbaijan, the, inevitable, response, by, timur, resulted, in, the, tokhtamysh, timur, war, in, the, initial, stage, of, the, war, timur, won, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, kondurcha, river, after, the, battle, tokhtamysh, and, some, of, his, army, were, allowed, to, escape, after, tokhtamysh, s, initial, defeat, timur, invaded, muscovy, to, the, north, of, tokhtamysh, s, holdings, timur, s, army, burned, ryazan, and, advanced, on, moscow, he, was, pulled, away, before, reaching, the, oka, river, by, tokhtamysh, s, renewed, campaign, in, the, south, in, the, first, phase, of, the, conflict, with, tokhtamysh, timur, led, an, army, of, over, 100, 000, men, north, for, more, than, 700, miles, into, the, steppe, he, then, rode, west, about, 1, 000, miles, advancing, in, a, front, more, than, 10, miles, wide, during, this, advance, timur, s, army, got, far, enough, north, to, be, in, a, region, of, very, long, summer, days, causing, complaints, by, his, muslim, soldiers, about, keeping, a, long, schedule, of, prayers, it, was, then, that, tokhtamysh, s, army, was, boxed, in, against, the, east, bank, of, the, volga, river, in, the, orenburg, region, and, destroyed, at, the, battle, of, the, kondurcha, river, in, 1391, in, the, second, phase, of, the, conflict, timur, took, a, different, route, against, the, enemy, by, invading, the, realm, of, tokhtamysh, via, the, caucasus, region, in, 1395, timur, defeated, tokhtamysh, in, the, battle, of, the, terek, river, concluding, the, struggle, between, the, two, monarchs, tokhtamysh, was, unable, to, restore, his, power, or, prestige, and, he, was, killed, about, a, decade, later, in, the, area, of, present, day, tyumen, during, the, course, of, timur, s, campaigns, his, army, destroyed, sarai, the, capital, of, the, golden, horde, and, astrakhan, subsequently, disrupting, the, golden, horde, s, silk, road, the, golden, horde, no, longer, held, power, after, their, losses, to, timur, in, may, 1393, timur, s, army, invaded, the, anjudan, crippling, the, ismaili, village, only, a, year, after, his, assault, on, the, ismailis, in, mazandaran, the, village, was, prepared, for, the, attack, evidenced, by, its, fortress, and, system, of, tunnels, undeterred, timur, s, soldiers, flooded, the, tunnels, by, cutting, into, a, channel, overhead, timur, s, reasons, for, attacking, this, village, are, not, yet, well, understood, however, it, has, been, suggested, that, his, religious, persuasions, and, view, of, himself, as, an, executor, of, divine, will, may, have, contributed, to, his, motivations, the, persian, historian, khwandamir, explains, that, an, ismaili, presence, was, growing, more, politically, powerful, in, persian, iraq, a, group, of, locals, in, the, region, was, dissatisfied, with, this, and, khwandamir, writes, these, locals, assembled, and, brought, up, their, complaint, with, timur, possibly, provoking, his, attack, on, the, ismailis, there, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, tughlaq, dynasty, which, had, been, ruling, over, delhi, sultanate, since, 1320, had, declined, most, of, the, provincial, governors, had, asserted, their, independence, and, the, sultanate, was, reduced, to, only, a, part, of, its, former, extent, this, anarchy, drew, the, attention, of, timur, who, in, 1398, invaded, indian, subcontinent, during, the, reign, of, sultan, nasir, ud, din, mahmud, shah, tughluq, after, crossing, the, indus, river, on, 30, september, 1398, with, a, force, of, 90, 000, he, sacked, tulamba, and, massacred, its, inhabitants, he, sent, an, advance, guard, under, his, grandson, pir, muhammad, who, captured, multan, after, a, siege, of, six, months, his, invasion, was, unopposed, as, most, of, the, nobility, surrendered, without, a, fight, however, he, did, encounter, resistance, by, a, force, of, 2, 000, under, malik, jasrat, at, sutlej, river, between, tulamba, and, dipalpur, jasrat, was, defeated, and, taken, away, as, captive, next, he, captured, the, fort, of, bhatner, which, was, being, defended, by, rajput, chief, rai, dul, chand, and, demolished, it, while, on, his, march, towards, delhi, timur, was, opposed, by, the, jat, peasantry, who, would, loot, caravans, and, then, disappear, in, the, forests, he, had, thousands, of, jats, killed, and, many, taken, captive, but, the, sultanate, at, delhi, did, nothing, to, stop, his, advance, the, battle,

that, they, might, revolt, sultan, nasir, ud, din, mahmud, shah, tughluq, and, the, army, of, mallu, iqbal, had, war, elephants, armored, with, chain, mail, and, poison, on, their, tusks, as, his, tatar, forces, were, afraid, of, the, elephants, timur, ordered, his, men, to, dig, a, trench, in, front, of, their, positions, timur, then, loaded, his, camels, with, as, much, wood, and, hay, as, they, could, carry, when, the, war, elephants, charged, timur, set, the, hay, on, fire, and, prodded, the, camels, with, iron, sticks, causing, them, to, charge, at, the, elephants, howling, in, pain,

elephants, turned, around, and, stampeded, back, toward, their, own, lines, timur, capitalized, on, the, subsequent, disruption, in, the, forces, of, nasir, ud, din, mahmud, shah, tughluq, securing, an, easy, victory, nasir, ud, din, mahmud, shah, tughluq, fled, with, remnants, of, his, forces, the, capture, of, the, delhi, sultanate, was, one, of, timur, s, largest, and, most, devastating,

food, for, the, birds, by, timur, s, soldiers, timur, s, invasion, and, destruction, of, delhi, continued, the, chaos, that, was, still, consuming, india, and, the, city, would, not, be, able, to, recover, from, the, great, loss, it, suffered, for, almost, a, century, before, the, end, of, 1399, timur, started, a, war, with, bayezid, i, sultan, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, mamluk, sultan, of, egypt, nasir, ad, din, faraj, bayezid, began, annexing, the, territory, of, turkmen, and, muslim, rulers, in, anatolia, as, timur, claimed, sovereignty, over, the, turkoman, rulers, they,

earlier, in, the, campaign, and, when, they, ran, out, of, prisoners, to, kill, many, resorted, to, beheading, their, own, wives, british, historian, david, nicolle, in, his, the, mongol, warlords, quotes, an, anonymous, contemporary, historian, who, compared, timur, s, army, to, ants, and, locusts, covering, the, whole, countryside, plundering, and, ravaging, in, the, meantime, years, of, insulting, letters, had, passed, between, timur, and, bayezid, both, rulers, insulted, each, other, in, their, own, way, while, timur, preferred, to, undermine, bayezid, s, position, as, a, ruler, and, play, down, the, significance, of, his, military, successes, this, is, the, excerpt, from, one, of, timur, s, letters, addressed, to, ottoman, sultan, believe, me, you, are, but, pismire, ant, don, t, seek, to, fight, the, elephants, for, they, ll, crush, you, under, their, feet, shall, a, petty, prince, such, as, you, are, contend, with, us, but, your, rodomontades, braggadocio, are, not,

battle, of, ankara, on, 20, july, 1402, bayezid, was, captured, in, battle, and, subsequently, died, in, captivity, initiating, the, twelve, year, ottoman, interregnum, period, timur, s, stated, motivation, for, attacking, bayezid, and, the, ottoman, empire, was, the, restoration, of, seljuq, authority, timur, saw, the, seljuks, as, the, rightful, rulers, of, anatolia, as, they, had, been, granted, rule, by, mongol, conquerors, illustrating, again, timur, s, interest, with, genghizid, legitimacy, in, december, 1402, timur, besieged, and, took, the, city, of, smyrna, a, stronghold, of,

attempt, on, mehmed, s, part, to, justify, to, timur, his, conquest, of, bursa, after, the, battle, of, ulubad, after, mehmed, established, himself, in, rum, timur, had, already, begun, preparations, for, his, return, to, central, asia, and, took, no, further, steps, to, interfere, with, the, status, quo, in, anatolia, while, timur, was, still, in, anatolia, qara, yusuf, assaulted, baghdad, and,

he, converted, to, islam, while, at, the, court, of, timur, in, samarkand, timur, preferred, to, fight, his, battles, in, the, spring, however, he, died, en, route, during, an, uncharacteristic, winter, campaign, in, december, 1404, timur, began, military, campaigns, against, ming, china, and, detained, a, ming, envoy, he, became, ill, while, encamped, on, the, farther, side, of, the, syr,

though, it, has, been, heavily, restored, in, recent, years, timur, had, twice, previously, appointed, an, heir, apparent, to, succeed, him, both, of, whom, he, had, outlived, the, first, his, son, jahangir, died, of, illness, in, 1376, 51, the, second, his, grandson, muhammad, sultan, had, died, from, battle, wounds, in, 1403, after, the, latter, s, death, timur, did, nothing, to, replace, him, it, was, only, when, he, was, on, his, own, death, bed, that, he, appointed, muhammad, sultan, s, younger, brother, pir, muhammad, as, his, successor, pir, muhammad, was, unable, to, gain, sufficient, support, from, his, relatives, and, a, bitter, civil, war, erupted, amongst, timur, s, descendants, with, multiple, princes, pursuing, their, claims, it, was, not, until, 1409, that, timur, s, youngest, son, shah, rukh, was, able, to, overcome, his, rivals, and, take, the, throne, as, timur, s, successor, timur, had, forty, three, wives, and, concubines, all, of, these, women, were, also,

religious, counsellor, and, adviser, was, the, hanafi, scholar, abdu, l, jabbar, khwarazmi, in, tirmidh, he, had, come, under, the, influence, of, his, spiritual, mentor, sayyid, baraka, a, leader, from, balkh, who, is, buried, alongside, timur, in, gur, e, amir, timur, was, known, to, hold, ali, and, the, ahl, al, bayt, in, high, regard, and, has, been, noted, by, various, scholars, for, his, pro, shia, stance, however, he, also, punished, shias, for, desecrating, the, memories, of, the, sahaba, timur, was, also, noted, for, attacking, the, shia, with, sunni, apologism, while, at, other, times, he, attacked, sunnis, on, religious, grounds, as, well, in, contrast, timur, held, the, seljuk, sultan, ahmad, sanjar, in, high, regard, for, attacking, the, ismailis, at, alamut, and, timur, s, own, attack, on, ismailis, at, anjudan, was, equally, brutal, timur, is, regarded, as, a, military, genius, and, as, a, brilliant, tactician, with, an, uncanny, ability, to, work, within, a, highly, fluid, political, structure, to, win, and, maintain, a, loyal, following, of, nomads, during, his, rule, in, central, asia, he, was, also, considered, extraordinarily, intelligent, not, only, intuitively, but, also, intellectually, in, samarkand, and, his, many, travels, timur, under, the, guidance, of, distinguished, scholars, was, able, to, learn, the, persian, mongolian, and, turkish, languages, according, to, ahmad, ibn, arabshah, timur, could, not, speak, arabic, however, it, was, persian, which, was, held, in, distinction, by, timur, as, it, was, the, language, not, only, of, his, court, but, also, that, of, his, chancellery, according, to, john, joseph, saunders, timur, was, the, product, of, an, islamized, and, iranized, society, and, not, steppe, nomadic, more, importantly, timur, was, characterized, as, an, opportunist, taking, advantage, of, his, turco, mongolian, heritage, timur, frequently, used, either, the, islamic, religion, or, the, sharia, law, fiqh, and, traditions, of, the, mongol, empire, to, achieve, his, military, goals, or, domestic, political, aims, timur, was, a, learned, king, and, enjoyed, the, company, of, scholars, he, was, tolerant, and, generous, to, them, he, was, a, contemporary, of, the, persian, poet, hafez, and, a, story, of, their, meeting, explains, that, timur, summoned, hafiz, who, had, written, a, ghazal, with, the, following, verse, timur, upbraided, him, for, this, verse, and, said, by, the, blows, of, my, well, tempered, sword, i, have, conquered, the, greater, part, of, the, world, to, enlarge, samarkand, and, bukhara, my, capitals, and, residences, and, you, pitiful, creature, would, exchange, these, two, cities, for, a, mole, hafez, undaunted, replied, it, is, by, similar, generosity, that, i, have, been, reduced, as, you, see, to, my, present, state, of, poverty, it, is, reported, that, the, king, was, pleased, by, the, witty, answer, and, the, poet, departed, with, magnificent, gifts, there, is, a, shared, view, that, timur, s, real, motive, for, his, campaigns, was, his, imperialistic, ambition, as, expressed, by, his, statement, the, whole, expanse, of, the, inhabited, part, of, the, world, is, not, large, enough, to, have, two, kings, however, besides, iran, timur, simply, plundered, the, states, he, invaded, with, a, purpose, of, enriching, his, native, samarqand, and, neglected, the, conquered, areas, which, may, have, resulted, in, a, relatively, quick, disintegration, of, his, empire, after, his, death, timur, used, persian, expressions, in, his, conversations, often, and, his, motto, was, the, persian, phrase, r, st, rust, meaning, truth, is, safety, or, veritas, salus, he, is, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, tamerlane, chess, variant, played, on, a, 10, 11, board, timur, had, numerous, epistolary, and, diplomatic, exchanges, with, various, european, states, especially, spain, and, france, relations, between, the, court, of, henry, iii, of, castile, and, that, of, timur, played, an, important, part, in, medieval, castilian, diplomacy, in, 1402, the, time, of, the, battle, of, ankara, two, spanish, ambassadors, were, already, with, timur, pelayo, de, sotomayor, and, fernando, de, palazuelos, later, timur, sent, to, the, court, of, the, kingdom, of, le, n, and, castile, a, chagatai, ambassador, named, hajji, muhammad, al, qazi, with, letters, and, gifts, in, return, henry, iii, of, castile, sent, a, famous, embassy, to, timur, s, court, in, samarkand, in, 1403, 06, led, by, ruy, gonz, lez, de, clavijo, with, two, other, ambassadors, alfonso, paez, and, gomez, de, salazar, on, their, return, timur, affirmed, that, he, regarded, the, king, of, castile, as, his, very, own, son, according, to, clavijo, timur, s, good, treatment, of, the, spanish, delegation, contrasted, with, the, disdain, shown, by, his, host, toward, the, envoys, of, the, lord, of, cathay, i, e, the, yongle, emperor, the, chinese, ruler, clavijo, s, visit, to, samarkand, allowed, him, to, report, to, the, european, audience, on, the, news, from, cathay, china, which, few, europeans, had, been, able, to, visit, directly, in, the, century, that, had, passed, since, the, travels, of, marco, polo, the, french, archives, preserve, a, copy, has, been, kept, of, the, answer, of, charles, vi, to, timur, dated, 15, june, 1403, in, addition, byzantine, john, vii, palaiologos, who, was, a, regent, during, his, uncle, s, absence, in, the, west, sent, a, dominican, friar, in, august, 1401, to, timur, to, pay, his, respect, and, propose, paying, tribute, to, him, instead, of, the, turks, once, he, managed, to, defeat, them, timur, s, legacy, is, a, mixed, one, while, central, asia, blossomed, under, his, reign, other, places, such, as, baghdad, damascus, delhi, and, other, arab, georgian, persian, and, indian, cities, were, sacked, and, destroyed, and, their, populations, massacred, thus, while, timur, still, retains, a, positive, image, in, muslim, central, asia, he, is, vilified, by, many, in, arabia, iraq, persia, and, india, where, some, of, his, greatest, atrocities, were, carried, out, however, ibn, khaldun, praises, timur, for, having, unified, much, of, the, muslim, world, when, other, conquerors, of, the, time, could, not, the, next, great, conqueror, of, the, middle, east, nader, shah, was, greatly, influenced, by, timur, and, almost, re, enacted, timur, s, conquests, and, battle, strategies, in, his, own, campaigns, like, timur, nader, shah, conquered, most, of, caucasia, persia, and, central, asia, along, with, also, sacking, delhi, timur, s, short, lived, empire, also, melded, the, turko, persian, tradition, in, transoxiana, and, in, most, of, the, territories, that, he, incorporated, into, his, fiefdom, persian, became, the, primary, language, of, administration, and, literary, culture, diwan, regardless, of, ethnicity, in, addition, during, his, reign, some, contributions, to, turkic, literature, were, penned, with, turkic, cultural, influence, expanding, and, flourishing, as, a, result, a, literary, form, of, chagatai, turkic, came, into, use, alongside, persian, as, both, a, cultural, and, an, official, language, tamerlane, virtually, exterminated, the, church, of, the, east, which, had, previously, been, a, major, branch, of, christianity, but, afterwards, became, largely, confined, to, a, small, area, now, known, as, the, assyrian, triangle, timur, is, officially, recognized, as, a, national, hero, in, uzbekistan, his, monument, in, tashkent, now, occupies, the, place, where, karl, marx, s, statue, once, stood, in, 1794, sake, dean, mahomed, published, his, travel, book, the, travels, of, dean, mahomet, the, book, begins, with, the, praise, of, genghis, khan, timur, and, particularly, the, first, mughal, emperor, babur, he, also, gives, important, details, on, the, then, incumbent, mughal, emperor, shah, alam, ii, the, poem, tamerlane, by, edgar, allan, poe, follows, a, fictionalized, version, of, timur, s, life, the, earliest, known, history, of, his, reign, was, nizam, al, din, shami, s, zafarnama, which, was, written, during, timur, s, lifetime, between, 1424, and, 1428, sharaf, ad, din, ali, yazdi, wrote, a, second, zafarnama, drawing, heavily, on, shami, s, earlier, work, ahmad, ibn, arabshah, wrote, a, much, less, favorable, history, in, arabic, arabshah, s, history, was, translated, into, latin, by, the, dutch, orientalist, jacobus, golius, in, 1636, as, timurid, sponsored, histories, the, two, zafarnama, s, present, a, dramatically, different, picture, from, arabshah, s, chronicle, william, jones, remarked, that, the, former, presented, timur, as, a, liberal, benevolent, and, illustrious, prince, while, the, latter, painted, him, as, deformed, and, impious, of, a, low, birth, and, detestable, principles, the, malfuzat, i, timur, and, the, appended, tuz, k, i, t, m, r, supposedly, timur, s, own, autobiography, are, almost, certainly, 17th, century, fabrications, the, scholar, abu, taleb, hosayni, presented, the, texts, to, the, mughal, emperor, shah, jahan, a, distant, descendant, of, timur, in, 1637, 1638, supposedly, after, discovering, the, chagatai, language, originals, in, the, library, of, a, yemeni, ruler, due, to, the, distance, between, yemen, and, timur, s, base, in, transoxiana, and, the, lack, of, any, other, evidence, of, the, originals, most, historians, consider, the, story, highly, implausible, and, suspect, hosayni, of, inventing, both, the, text, and, its, origin, story, timur, arguably, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, renaissance, culture, and, early, modern, europe, his, achievements, both, fascinated, and, horrified, europeans, from, the, fifteenth, century, to, the, early, nineteenth, century, european, views, of, timur, were, mixed, throughout, the, fifteenth, century, with, some, european, countries, calling, him, an, ally, and, others, seeing, him, as, a, threat, to, europe, because, of, his, rapid, expansion, and, brutality, 341, when, timur, captured, the, ottoman, sultan, bayezid, at, ankara, he, was, often, praised, and, seen, as, a, trusted, ally, by, european, rulers, such, as, charles, vi, of, france, and, henry, iv, of, england, because, they, believed, he, was, saving, christianity, from, the, turkic, empire, in, the, middle, east, those, two, kings, also, praised, him, because, his, victory, at, ankara, allowed, christian, merchants, to, remain, in, the, middle, east, and, allowed, for, their, safe, return, home, to, both, france, and, england, timur, was, also, praised, because, it, was, believed, that, he, helped, restore, the, right, of, passage, for, christian, pilgrims, to, the, holy, land, 341, 344, other, europeans, viewed, timur, as, a, barbaric, enemy, who, presented, a, threat, to, both, european, culture, and, the, religion, of, christianity, his, rise, to, power, moved, many, leaders, such, as, henry, iii, of, castile, to, send, embassies, to, samarkand, to, scout, out, timur, learn, about, his, people, make, alliances, with, him, and, try, to, convince, him, to, convert, to, christianity, in, order, to, avoid, war, 348, 349, in, the, introduction, to, a, 1723, translation, of, yazdi, s, zafarnama, the, translator, wrote, tells, us, that, there, are, calumnies, and, impostures, which, have, been, published, by, authors, of, romances, and, turkish, writers, who, were, his, enemies, and, envious, at, his, glory, among, whom, is, ahmed, bin, arabschah, as, timur, bec, had, conquered, the, turks, and, arabians, of, syria, and, had, even, taken, the, sultan, bajazet, prisoner, it, is, no, wonder, that, he, has, been, misrepresented, by, the, historians, of, those, nations, who, in, despite, of, truth, and, against, the, dignity, of, history, have, fallen, into, great, excesses, on, this, subject, timur, s, body, was, exhumed, from, his, tomb, on, 19, june, 1941, and, his, remains, examined, by, the, soviet, anthropologists, mikhail, m, gerasimov, lev, v, oshanin, and, v, ia, zezenkova, gerasimov, reconstructed, the, likeness, of, timur, from, his, skull, and, found, that, his, facial, characteristics, displayed, typical, mongoloid, features, i, e, east, asian, in, modern, terms, an, anthropologic, study, of, timur, s, cranium, shows, that, he, belonged, predominately, to, the, south, siberian, mongoloid, type, at, 5, feet, 8, inches, 173, centimeters, timur, was, tall, for, his, era, the, examinations, confirmed, that, timur, was, lame, and, had, a, withered, right, arm, due, to, his, injuries, his, right, thighbone, had, knitted, together, with, his, kneecap, and, the, configuration, of, the, knee, joint, suggests, that, he, kept, his, leg, bent, at, all, times, and, therefore, would, have, had, a, pronounced, limp, he, appears, to, have, been, broad, chested, and, his, hair, and, beard, were, red, it, is, alleged, that, timur, s, tomb, was, inscribed, with, the, words, when, i, rise, from, the, dead, the, world, shall, tremble, it, is, also, said, that, when, gerasimov, exhumed, the, body, an, additional, inscription, inside, the, casket, was, found, which, read, whomsoever, opens, my, tomb, shall, unleash, an, invader, more, terrible, than, i, even, though, people, close, to, gerasimov, claim, that, this, story, is, a, fabrication, the, legend, which, became, known, as, the, curse, of, timur, persists, in, any, case, three, days, after, gerasimov, began, the, exhumation, germany, invaded, the, soviet, union, timur, was, re, buried, with, full, islamic, ritual, in, november, 1942, just, before, the, soviet, victory, at, the, battle, of, stalingrad
