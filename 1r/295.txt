characterized, by, the, symbol, of, survival, this, symbol, is, expressed, in, the, omnipresent, use, of, victim, positions, in, canadian, literature, these, positions, represent, a, scale, of, self, consciousness, and, self, actualization, for, the, victim, in, the, victor, victim, relationship, the, victor, in, these, scenarios, may, be, other, humans, nature, the, wilderness, or, other,

canada, s, desire, to, wall, itself, off, from, outside, influence, as, a, critical, tool, to, analyze, canadian, literature, according, to, her, theories, in, works, such, as, survival, and, her, exploration, of, similar, themes, in, her, fiction, atwood, considers, canadian, literature, as, the, expression, of, canadian, identity, according, to, this, literature, canadian, identity, has, been, defined, by, a, fear, of, nature, by, settler, history, and, by, unquestioned, adherence, to, the, community, in, an, interview, with, the, scottish, critic, bill, findlay, in, 1979, atwood, discussed, the, relationship, of, canadian, writers, and, writing, to, the, imperial, cultures, of, america, and, britain, atwood, s, contribution, to, the, theorizing, of, canada, is, not, limited, to, her, non, fiction, works, several, of, her, works, including, the, journals, of, susanna, moodie, alias, grace, the, blind, assassin, and, surfacing, are, examples, of, what, postmodern, literary,

among, her, contributions, to, canadian, literature, atwood, is, a, founding, trustee, of, the, griffin, poetry, prize, as, well, as, a, founder, of, the, writers, trust, of, canada, a, non, profit, literary, organization, that, seeks, to, encourage, canada, s, writing, community, she, has, called, mona, awad, a, canadian, novelist, and, short, story, writer, her, literary, heir, apparent, atwood, s, work, has, been, of, interest, to, feminist, literary, critics, despite, atwood, s, unwillingness, at, times, to, apply, the, label, feminist, to, her, works, starting, with, the, publication, of, her, first, novel, the, edible, woman, atwood, asserted, i, don, t, consider, it, feminism, i, just, consider, it, social, realism, despite, her, rejection, of, the, label, at, times, critics, have, analyzed, the, sexual, politics, use, of, myth, and, fairytale, and, gendered, relationships, in, atwood, s, work, through, the, lens, of, feminism, before, the, 1985, publication, of, the, handmaid, s, tale, atwood, gave, an, interview, to, feminist, theorist, elizabeth, meese, in, which, she, defined, feminism, as, a, belief, in, the, rights, of, women, and, averred, that, if, practical, hardline, anti, male, feminists, took, over, and, became, the, government, i, would, resist, them, in, 2017, she, clarified, her, discomfort, with, the, label, feminism, by, stating, i, always, want, to, know, what, people, mean, by, that, word, some, people, mean, it, quite, negatively, other, people, mean, it, very, positively, some, people, mean, it, in, a, broad, sense, other, people, mean, it, in, a, more, specific, sense, therefore, in, order, to, answer, the, question, you, have, to, ask, the, person, what, they, mean, speaking, to, the, guardian, she, said, for, instance, some, feminists, have, historically, been, against, lipstick, and, letting, transgender, women, into, women, s, washrooms, those, are, not, positions, i, have, agreed, with, a, position, she, repeated, to, the, irish, times, in, an, interview, with, penguin, books, atwood, stated, that, the, driving, question, throughout, her, writing, of, the, handmaid, s, tale, was, if, you, were, going, to, shove, women, back, into, the, home, and, deprive, them, of, all, of, these, gains, that, they, thought, they, had, made, how, would, you, do, it, but, related, this, question, to, totalitarianism, not, feminism, in, january, 2018, atwood, penned, the, op, ed, am, i, a, bad, feminist, for, the, globe, and, mail, the, piece, was, in, response, to, social, media, backlash,

professor, accused, of, sexual, harassment, and, assault, by, a, student, while, feminist, critics, denounced, atwood, for, her, support, of, galloway, atwood, asserted, that, her, signature, was, in, support, of, due, process, in, the, legal, system, she, has, been, criticized, for, her, comments, surrounding, the, metoo, movement, particularly, that, it, is, a, symptom, of, a, broken, legal, system, in, 2018, following, a, partnership, between, hulu, s, adaptation, of, the, handmaid, s, tale, and, women, s, rights, organisation, equality, now, atwood, was, honored, at, their, 2018, make,

subjects, that, would, get, people, with, jobs, fired, if, they, themselves, spoke, you, however, at, equality, now, are, real, activists, i, hope, people, will, give, equality, now, lots, and, lots, of, money, today, so, they, can, write, equal, laws, enact, equal, laws, and, see, that, equal, laws, are, implemented, that, way, in, time, all, girls, may, be, able, to, grow, up, believing, that, there, are, no, avenues, that, are, closed, to, them, simply, because, they, are, girls, in, 2019, atwood, partnered, with, equality, now, for, the, release, of, the, testaments, atwood, has, resisted, the, suggestion, that, the, handmaid, s, tale, and, oryx, and, crake, are, science, fiction, suggesting, to, the, guardian, in, 2003, that, they, are, speculative, fiction, science, fiction,
