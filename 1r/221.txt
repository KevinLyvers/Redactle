sappho, s, f, o, greek, sapph, aeolic, greek, ps, pph, c, 630, c, 570, bc, was, an, archaic, greek, poet, from, eresos, or, mytilene, on, the, island, of, lesbos, sappho, is, known, for, her, lyric, poetry, written, to, be, sung, while, accompanied, by, music, in, ancient, times, sappho, was, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, lyric, poets, and, was, given, names, such, as, the, tenth, muse, and, the, poetess, most, of, sappho, s, poetry, is, now, lost, and, what, is, extant, has, mostly, survived, in, fragmentary, form, only, the, ode, to, aphrodite, is, certainly, complete, as, well, as, lyric, poetry, ancient, commentators, claimed, that, sappho, wrote, elegiac, and, iambic, poetry, three, epigrams, formerly, attributed, to, sappho, are, extant, but, these, are, actually, hellenistic, imitations, of, sappho, s, style, little, is, known, of, sappho, s, life, she, was, from, a, wealthy, family, from, lesbos, though, her, parents, names, are, uncertain, ancient, sources, say, that, she, had, three, brothers, charaxos, larichos, and, eurygios, two, of, them, charaxos, and, larichos, are, mentioned, in, the, brothers, poem, discovered, in, 2014, she, was, exiled, to, sicily, around, 600, bc, and, may, have, continued, to, work, until, around, 570, bc, according, to, legend, she, killed, herself, by, leaping, from, the, leucadian, cliffs, due, to, her, unrequited, love, for, the, ferryman, phaon, sappho, was, a, prolific, poet, probably, composing, around, 10, 000, lines, she, was, best, known, in, antiquity, for, her, love, poetry, other, themes, in, the, surviving, fragments, of, her, work, include, family, and, religion, she, probably, wrote, poetry, for, both, individual, and, choral, performance, most, of, her, best, known, and, best, preserved, fragments, explore, personal, emotions, and, were, probably, composed, for, solo, performance, her, works, are, known, for, their, clarity, of, language, vivid, images, and, immediacy, the, context, in, which, she, composed, her, poems, has, long, been, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, the, most, influential, suggestions, have, been, that, she, had, some, sort, of, educational, or, religious, role, or, wrote, for, the, symposium, sappho, s, poetry, was, well, known, and, greatly, admired, through, much, of, antiquity, and, she, was, among, the, canon, of, nine, lyric, poets, most, highly, esteemed, by, scholars, of, hellenistic, alexandria, sappho, s, poetry, is, still, considered, extraordinary, and, her, works, continue, to, influence, other, writers, beyond, her, poetry, she, is, well, known, as, a, symbol, of, love, and, desire, between, women, with, the, english, words, sapphic, and, lesbian, deriving, from, her, name, and, that, of, her, home, island, respectively, modern, knowledge, of, sappho, comes, both, from, what, can, be, inferred, from, her, own, poetry, and, from, mentions, of, her, in, other, ancient, texts, her, poetry, which, with, the, exception, of, a, single, complete, poem, survives, only, in, fragments, is, the, only, contemporary, source, for, her, life, the, earliest, surviving, biography, of, sappho, dates, to, the, late, second, or, early, third, century, ad, approximately, eight, centuries, after, her, own, lifetime, the, next, is, the, suda, a, tenth, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, other, sources, that, mention, details, of, her, life, were, written, much, closer, to, her, own, era, beginning, in, the, fifth, century, bc, one, of, the, earliest, is, herodotus, account, of, the, relationship, between, the, egyptian, courtesan, rhodopis, and, sappho, s, brother, charaxos, the, information, about, her, life, recorded, in, ancient, sources, was, derived, from, statements, in, her, own, poetry, that, ancient, authors, assumed, were, autobiographical, along, with, local, traditions, some, of, the, ancient, traditions, about, her, such, as, those, about, her, sexuality, and, appearance, may, derive, from, ancient, athenian, comedy, until, the, 19th, century, ancient, biographical, accounts, of, archaic, poets, lives, were, largely, accepted, as, factual, in, the, 19th, century, classicists, began, to, be, more, sceptical, of, these, traditions, and, instead, tried, to, derive, biographical, information, from, the, poets, own, works, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, scholars, became, increasingly, sceptical, of, greek, lyric, poetry, as, a, source, of, autobiographical, information, questioning, whether, the, first, person, narrator, in, the, poems, was, meant, to, express, the, experiences, and, feelings, of, the, poets, some, scholars, such, as, mary, lefkowitz, argue, that, almost, nothing, can, be, known, about, the, lives, of, early, greek, poets, such, as, sappho, most, scholars, believe, that, ancient, testimonies, about, poets, lives, contain, some, truth, but, must, be, treated, with, caution, little, is, known, about, sappho, s, life, for, certain, she, was, from, the, island, of, lesbos, and, lived, at, the, end, of, the, seventh, and, beginning, of, the, sixth, centuries, bc, this, is, the, date, given, by, most, ancient, sources, who, considered, her, a, contemporary, of, the, poet, alcaeus, and, the, tyrant, pittacus, both, also, from, lesbos, she, therefore, may, have, been, born, in, the, third, quarter, of, the, seventh, century, franco, ferrari, infers, a, date, of, around, 650, or, 640, bc, david, campbell, suggests, around, or, before, 630, bc, gregory, hutchinson, suggests, she, was, active, until, around, 570, bc, tradition, names, sappho, s, mother, as, cle, s, this, may, derive, from, a, now, lost, poem, or, record, though, ancient, scholars, may, simply, have, guessed, this, name, assuming, that, sappho, s, daughter, was, named, cle, s, after, her, mother, ancient, sources, record, ten, different, names, for, sappho, s, father, this, proliferation, of, possible, names, suggests, that, he, was, not, explicitly, named, in, any, of, her, poetry, the, earliest, and, most, commonly, attested, name, for, him, is, scamandronymus, in, ovid, s, heroides, sappho, s, father, died, when, she, was, six, he, is, not, mentioned, in, any, of, her, surviving, works, but, campbell, suggests, that, this, detail, may, have, been, based, on, a, now, lost, poem, her, own, name, is, found, in, numerous, variant, spellings, the, form, that, appears, in, her, own, extant, poetry, is, psappho, sappho, was, said, to, have, three, brothers, eurygios, larichos, and, charaxos, according, to, athenaeus, she, praised, larichos, for, being, a, cupbearer, in, the, town, hall, of, mytilene, an, office, held, by, boys, of, the, best, families, this, indication, that, sappho, was, born, into, an, aristocratic, family, is, consistent, with, the, sometimes, rarefied, environments, that, her, verses, record, one, ancient, tradition, tells, of, a, relationship, between, charaxos, and, the, egyptian, courtesan, rhodopis, in, the, fifth, century, bc, herodotus, the, oldest, source, of, the, story, reports, that, charaxos, ransomed, rhodopis, for, a, large, sum, and, that, sappho, wrote, a, poem, rebuking, him, for, this, the, names, of, two, of, the, brothers, charaxos, and, larichos, are, mentioned, in, the, brothers, poem, discovered, in, 2014, the, final, brother, eurygios, is, mentioned, in, three, ancient, sources, but, nowhere, in, the, extant, works, of, sappho, sappho, may, have, had, a, daughter, named, cle, s, who, is, referred, to, in, two, fragments, not, all, scholars, accept, that, cle, s, was, sappho, s, daughter, fragment, 132, describes, cle, s, as, pais, which, as, well, as, meaning, child, can, also, refer, to, the, youthful, beloved, in, a, male, homosexual, liaison, it, has, been, suggested, that, cle, s, was, one, of, her, younger, lovers, rather, than, her, daughter, though, judith, hallett, argues, that, the, description, of, cleis, as, agapata, beloved, in, fragment, 132, suggests, that, sappho, was, referring, to, cle, s, as, her, daughter, as, in, other, greek, literature, the, word, is, used, for, familial, but, not, sexual, relationships, according, to, the, suda, sappho, was, married, to, kerkylas, of, andros, this, name, appears, to, have, been, invented, by, a, comic, poet, the, name, kerkylas, appears, to, be, a, diminutive, of, the, word, kerkos, a, possible, meaning, of, which, is, penis, and, which, is, not, otherwise, attested, as, a, name, while, andros, as, well, as, being, the, name, of, a, greek, island, is, a, form, of, the, greek, word, aner, which, means, man, thus, the, name, which, can, mean, prick, of, the, isle, of, man, likely, comes, from, comedy, one, tradition, said, that, sappho, was, exiled, from, lesbos, around, 600, bc, the, only, ancient, source, for, this, story, is, the, parian, chronicle, which, records, her, going, into, exile, in, sicily, some, time, between, 604, and, 595, this, may, have, been, as, a, result, of, her, family, s, involvement, with, the, conflicts, between, political, elites, on, lesbos, in, this, period, it, is, unknown, which, side, sappho, s, family, took, in, these, conflicts, but, most, scholars, believe, that, they, were, in, the, same, faction, as, her, contemporary, alcaeus, who, was, exiled, when, myrsilus, took, power, a, tradition, going, back, at, least, to, menander, fr, 258, k, suggested, that, sappho, killed, herself, by, jumping, off, the, leucadian, cliffs, due, to, her, unrequited, love, of, phaon, a, ferryman, this, story, is, related, to, two, myths, about, the, goddess, aphrodite, in, one, aphrodite, rewarded, the, elderly, ferryman, phaon, with, youth, and, good, looks, as, a, reward, for, taking, her, in, his, ferry, without, asking, for, payment, in, the, other, aphrodite, was, cured, of, her, grief, at, the, death, of, her, lover, adonis, by, throwing, herself, off, the, leucadian, cliffs, on, the, advice, of, apollo, the, story, of, sappho, s, leap, is, regarded, as, ahistorical, by, modern, scholars, perhaps, invented, by, the, comic, poets, or, originating, from, a, misreading, of, a, first, person, reference, in, a, non, biographical, poem, it, was, used, to, reassure, ancient, audiences, of, sappho, s, heterosexuality, and, became, particularly, important, in, the, nineteenth, century, to, writers, who, saw, homosexuality, as, immoral, and, wished, to, construct, sappho, as, heterosexual, sappho, probably, wrote, around, 10, 000, lines, of, poetry, today, only, about, 650, survive, she, is, best, known, for, her, lyric, poetry, written, to, be, accompanied, by, music, the, suda, also, attributes, to, her, epigrams, elegiacs, and, iambics, three, of, these, epigrams, are, extant, but, are, in, fact, later, hellenistic, poems, inspired, by, sappho, the, iambic, and, elegiac, poems, attributed, to, her, in, the, suda, may, also, be, later, imitations, ancient, authors, claim, that, she, primarily, wrote, love, poetry, and, the, indirect, transmission, of, her, work, supports, this, notion, however, the, papyrus, tradition, suggests, that, this, may, not, have, been, the, case, a, series, of, papyri, published, in, 2014, contains, fragments, of, ten, consecutive, poems, from, an, ancient, edition, of, sappho, of, which, only, two, are, certainly, love, poems, while, at, least, three, and, possibly, four, are, primarily, concerned, with, family, it, is, uncertain, when, sappho, s, poetry, was, first, written, down, some, scholars, believe, that, she, wrote, her, own, poetry, down, for, future, readers, others, that, if, she, wrote, her, works, down, it, was, as, an, aid, to, reperformance, rather, than, as, a, work, of, literature, in, its, own, right, in, the, fifth, century, bc, athenian, book, publishers, probably, began, to, produce, copies, of, lesbian, lyric, poetry, some, including, explanatory, material, and, glosses, as, well, as, the, poems, themselves, some, time, in, the, second, or, third, century, bc, alexandrian, scholars, produced, a, critical, edition, of, her, poetry, there, may, have, been, more, than, one, alexandrian, edition, john, j, winkler, argues, for, two, one, edited, by, aristophanes, of, byzantium, and, another, by, his, pupil, aristarchus, of, samothrace, this, is, not, certain, ancient, sources, tell, us, that, aristarchus, edition, of, alcaeus, replaced, the, edition, by, aristophanes, but, are, silent, on, whether, sappho, s, work, also, went, through, multiple, editions, the, alexandrian, edition, of, sappho, s, poetry, may, have, been, based, on, an, athenian, text, of, her, poems, or, one, from, her, native, lesbos, and, was, divided, into, at, least, eight, books, though, the, exact, number, is, uncertain, many, modern, scholars, have, followed, denys, page, who, conjectured, a, ninth, book, in, the, standard, edition, dimitrios, yatromanolakis, doubts, this, noting, that, though, ancient, sources, refer, to, an, eighth, book, of, her, poetry, none, mention, a, ninth, the, alexandrian, edition, of, sappho, probably, grouped, her, poems, by, their, metre, ancient, sources, tell, us, that, each, of, the, first, three, books, contained, poems, in, a, single, specific, metre, book, one, of, the, alexandrian, edition, made, up, of, poems, in, sapphic, stanzas, seems, to, have, been, ordered, alphabetically, even, after, the, publication, of, the, standard, alexandrian, edition, sappho, s, poetry, continued, to, circulate, in, other, poetry, collections, for, instance, the, cologne, papyrus, on, which, the, tithonus, poem, is, preserved, was, part, of, a, hellenistic, anthology, of, poetry, which, contained, poetry, arranged, by, theme, rather, than, by, metre, and, incipit, as, it, was, in, the, alexandrian, edition, the, earliest, surviving, manuscripts, of, sappho, including, the, potsherd, on, which, fragment, 2, is, preserved, date, to, the, third, century, bc, and, thus, might, predate, the, alexandrian, edition, the, latest, surviving, copies, of, her, poems, transmitted, directly, from, ancient, times, are, written, on, parchment, codex, pages, from, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, ad, and, were, surely, reproduced, from, ancient, papyri, now, lost, manuscript, copies, of, her, works, may, have, survived, a, few, centuries, longer, but, around, the, ninth, century, her, poetry, appears, to, have, disappeared, and, by, the, 12th, century, john, tzetzes, could, write, that, the, passage, of, time, has, destroyed, sappho, and, her, works, according, to, legend, sappho, s, poetry, was, lost, because, the, church, disapproved, of, her, morals, these, legends, appear, to, have, originated, in, the, renaissance, around, 1550, jerome, cardan, wrote, that, gregory, nazianzen, had, her, work, publicly, destroyed, and, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, joseph, justus, scaliger, claimed, that, her, works, were, burned, in, rome, and, constantinople, in, 1073, on, the, orders, of, pope, gregory, vii, in, reality, sappho, s, work, was, probably, lost, as, the, demand, for, it, was, insufficiently, great, for, it, to, be, copied, onto, parchment, when, codices, superseded, papyrus, scrolls, as, the, predominant, form, of, book, a, contributing, factor, to, the, loss, of, her, poems, may, have, been, her, aeolic, dialect, considered, provincial, in, a, period, where, the, attic, dialect, was, seen, as, the, true, classical, greek, and, had, become, the, standard, for, literary, compositions, consequently, many, readers, found, her, dialect, difficult, to, understand, in, the, second, century, ad, the, roman, author, apuleius, specifically, remarks, on, its, strangeness, and, several, commentaries, on, the, subject, demonstrate, the, difficulties, that, readers, had, with, it, this, was, part, of, a, more, general, decline, in, interest, in, the, archaic, poets, indeed, the, surviving, papyri, suggest, that, sappho, s, poetry, survived, longer, than, that, of, her, contemporaries, such, as, alcaeus, only, approximately, 650, lines, of, sappho, s, poetry, still, survive, of, which, just, one, poem, the, ode, to, aphrodite, is, complete, and, more, than, half, of, the, original, lines, survive, in, around, ten, more, fragments, many, of, the, surviving, fragments, of, sappho, contain, only, a, single, word, for, example, fragment, 169a, is, simply, a, word, meaning, wedding, gifts, athremata, and, survives, as, part, of, a, dictionary, of, rare, words, the, two, major, sources, of, surviving, fragments, of, sappho, are, quotations, in, other, ancient, works, from, a, whole, poem, to, as, little, as, a, single, word, and, fragments, of, papyrus, many, of, which, were, rediscovered, at, oxyrhynchus, in, egypt, other, fragments, survive, on, other, materials, including, parchment, and, potsherds, the, oldest, surviving, fragment, of, sappho, currently, known, is, the, cologne, papyrus, that, contains, the, tithonus, poem, dating, to, the, third, century, bc, until, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, sappho, s, poetry, was, known, only, through, quotations, in, the, works, of, other, ancient, authors, in, 1879, the, first, new, discovery, of, a, fragment, of, sappho, was, made, at, fayum, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, bernard, pyne, grenfell, and, arthur, surridge, hunt, had, begun, to, excavate, an, ancient, rubbish, dump, at, oxyrhynchus, leading, to, the, discoveries, of, many, previously, unknown, fragments, of, sappho, fragments, of, sappho, continue, to, be, rediscovered, in, the, 21st, century, major, discoveries, were, made, in, 2004, the, tithonus, poem, and, a, new, previously, unknown, fragment, and, 2014, fragments, of, nine, poems, five, already, known, but, with, new, readings, four, including, the, brothers, poem, not, previously, known, additionally, in, 2005, a, commentary, on, her, poems, on, a, papyrus, from, the, second, or, third, century, ad, was, published, he, seems, like, a, god, to, me, the, man, who, is, near, you, listening, to, your, sweet, voice, and, exquisite, laughter, that, makes, my, heart, so, wildly, beat, in, my, breast, if, i, but, see, you, for, a, moment, then, all, my, words, leave, me, my, tongue, is, broken, and, a, sudden, fire, creeps, through, my, blood, no, longer, can, i, see, my, ears, are, full, of, noise, in, all, my, body, i, shudder, and, sweat, i, am, pale, as, the, sun, scorched, grass, in, my, fury, i, seem, like, a, dead, woman, but, i, would, dare, sappho, 31, trans, edward, storer, sappho, worked, within, a, well, developed, tradition, of, poetry, from, lesbos, which, had, evolved, its, own, poetic, diction, metres, and, conventions, prior, to, sappho, and, her, contemporary, alcaeus, lesbos, was, associated, with, poetry, and, music, through, the, mythical, orpheus, and, arion, and, through, the, seventh, century, bc, poet, terpander, the, aeolic, metrical, tradition, in, which, she, composed, her, poetry, was, distinct, from, that, of, the, rest, of, greece, as, its, lines, always, contained, a, fixed, number, of, syllables, in, contrast, to, other, traditions, that, allowed, for, the, substitution, of, two, short, syllables, for, one, long, or, vice, versa, sappho, was, one, of, the, first, greek, poets, to, adopt, the, lyric, i, to, write, poetry, adopting, the, viewpoint, of, a, specific, person, in, contrast, to, the, earlier, poets, homer, and, hesiod, who, present, themselves, more, as, conduits, of, divine, inspiration, her, poetry, explores, individual, identity, and, personal, emotions, desire, jealousy, and, love, it, also, adopts, and, reinterprets, the, existing, imagery, of, epic, poetry, in, exploring, these, themes, much, of, her, poetry, focuses, on, the, lives, and, experiences, of, women, along, with, the, love, poetry, for, which, she, is, best, known, her, surviving, works, include, poetry, focused, on, the, family, epic, influenced, narrative, wedding, songs, cult, hymns, and, invective, with, the, exception, of, a, few, songs, where, the, performance, context, can, be, deduced, from, the, surviving, fragments, with, some, degree, of, confidence, scholars, disagree, on, how, and, where, sappho, s, works, were, performed, they, seem, to, have, been, composed, for, a, variety, of, occasions, both, public, and, private, and, probably, encompassed, both, solo, and, choral, works, most, of, her, best, preserved, fragments, such, as, the, ode, to, aphrodite, are, usually, thought, to, be, written, for, solo, performance, though, some, scholars, such, as, andr, lardinois, believe, that, most, or, all, of, her, poems, were, originally, composed, for, choral, performances, these, works, which, leslie, kurke, describes, as, private, and, informal, compositions, in, contrast, to, the, public, ritual, nature, of, cultic, hymns, and, wedding, songs, tend, to, avoid, giving, details, of, a, specific, chronological, geographical, or, occasional, setting, which, kurke, suggests, facilitated, their, reperformance, by, performers, outside, sappho, s, original, context, sappho, s, poetry, is, known, for, its, clear, language, and, simple, thoughts, sharply, drawn, images, and, use, of, direct, quotation, that, brings, a, sense, of, immediacy, unexpected, word, play, is, a, characteristic, feature, of, her, style, an, example, is, from, fragment, 96, now, she, stands, out, among, lydian, women, as, after, sunset, the, rose, fingered, moon, exceeds, all, stars, a, variation, of, the, homeric, epithet, rosy, fingered, dawn, her, poetry, often, uses, hyperbole, according, to, ancient, critics, because, of, its, charm, for, example, in, fragment, 111, she, writes, that, the, groom, approaches, like, ares, much, bigger, than, a, big, man, kurke, groups, sappho, with, those, archaic, greek, poets, from, what, has, been, called, the, lite, ideological, tradition, which, valued, luxury, habrosyne, and, high, birth, these, elite, poets, tended, to, identify, themselves, with, the, worlds, of, greek, myths, gods, and, heroes, as, well, as, the, wealthy, east, especially, lydia, thus, in, fragment, 2, she, has, aphrodite, pour, into, golden, cups, nectar, lavishly, mingled, with, joys, while, in, the, tithonus, poem, she, explicitly, states, that, i, love, the, finer, things, according, to, page, dubois, the, language, as, well, as, the, content, of, sappho, s, poetry, evokes, an, aristocratic, sphere, she, contrasts, sappho, s, flowery, adorned, style, with, the, austere, decorous, restrained, style, embodied, in, the, works, of, later, classical, authors, such, as, sophocles, demosthenes, and, pindar, sappho, s, poetry, was, written, to, be, sung, but, its, musical, content, is, largely, uncertain, as, it, is, unlikely, that, any, system, of, musical, notation, existed, in, ancient, greece, before, the, fifth, century, the, original, music, that, accompanied, her, songs, probably, did, not, survive, until, the, classical, period, and, no, ancient, musical, scores, to, accompany, her, poetry, survive, sappho, reportedly, wrote, in, the, mixolydian, mode, which, was, considered, sorrowful, it, was, commonly, used, in, greek, tragedy, and, aristoxenus, believed, that, the, tragedians, learned, it, from, sappho, aristoxenus, attributed, to, sappho, the, invention, of, this, mode, but, this, is, unlikely, while, there, are, no, attestations, that, she, used, other, modes, she, presumably, varied, them, depending, on, the, poem, s, character, when, originally, sung, each, syllable, of, her, text, likely, corresponded, to, one, note, as, the, use, of, lengthy, melismata, developed, in, the, later, classical, period, sappho, wrote, both, songs, for, solo, and, choral, performance, with, alcaeus, she, pioneered, a, new, style, of, sung, monody, single, line, melody, that, departed, from, the, multi, part, choral, style, that, largely, defined, earlier, greek, music, this, style, afforded, her, more, opportunities, to, individualize, the, content, of, her, poems, the, historian, plutarch, noted, that, she, speaks, words, mingled, truly, with, fire, and, through, her, songs, she, draws, up, the, heat, of, her, heart, some, scholars, theorize, that, the, tithonus, poem, was, among, her, works, meant, for, a, solo, singer, only, fragments, of, sappho, s, choral, works, are, extant, of, these, her, epithalamia, wedding, songs, survive, better, than, her, cultic, hymns, the, later, compositions, were, probably, meant, for, antiphonal, performance, between, either, a, male, and, female, choir, or, a, soloist, and, choir, in, sappho, s, time, sung, poetry, was, usually, accompanied, by, musical, instruments, which, usually, doubled, the, voice, in, unison, or, played, homophonically, an, octave, higher, or, lower, her, poems, mention, numerous, instruments, including, the, pektis, a, harp, of, lydian, origin, and, lyre, sappho, is, most, closely, associated, with, the, barbitos, a, lyre, like, string, instrument, that, was, deep, in, pitch, euphorion, of, chalcis, reports, that, she, referred, to, it, in, her, poetry, and, a, fifth, century, red, figure, vase, by, either, the, dokimasia, painter, or, brygos, painter, includes, sappho, and, alcaeus, with, barbitoi, sappho, mentions, the, aulos, a, wind, instrument, with, two, pipes, in, fragment, 44, as, accompanying, the, song, of, the, trojan, women, at, hector, and, andromache, s, wedding, but, not, as, accompanying, her, own, poetry, later, greek, commentators, wrongly, believed, that, she, had, invented, the, plectrum, one, of, the, major, focuses, of, scholars, studying, sappho, has, been, to, attempt, to, determine, the, cultural, context, in, which, sappho, s, poems, were, composed, and, performed, various, cultural, contexts, and, social, roles, played, by, sappho, have, been, suggested, primarily, teacher, priestess, chorus, leader, and, symposiast, however, the, performance, contexts, of, many, of, sappho, s, fragments, are, not, easy, to, determine, and, for, many, more, than, one, possible, context, is, conceivable, one, longstanding, suggestion, of, a, social, role, for, sappho, is, that, of, sappho, as, schoolmistress, this, view, popular, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, was, advocated, by, the, german, classicist, ulrich, von, wilamowitz, moellendorff, to, explain, away, sappho, s, passion, for, her, girls, and, defend, her, from, accusations, of, homosexuality, more, recently, the, idea, has, been, criticised, by, historians, as, anachronistic, and, has, been, rejected, by, several, prominent, classicists, as, unjustified, by, the, evidence, in, 1959, denys, page, for, example, stated, that, sappho, s, extant, fragments, portray, the, loves, and, jealousies, the, pleasures, and, pains, of, sappho, and, her, companions, and, he, adds, we, have, found, and, shall, find, no, trace, of, any, formal, or, official, or, professional, relationship, between, them, no, trace, of, sappho, the, principal, of, an, academy, campbell, in, 1967, judged, that, sappho, may, have, presided, over, a, literary, coterie, but, that, evidence, for, a, formal, appointment, as, priestess, or, teacher, is, hard, to, find, none, of, sappho, s, own, poetry, mentions, her, teaching, and, the, earliest, source, to, support, the, idea, of, sappho, as, a, teacher, comes, from, ovid, six, centuries, after, sappho, s, lifetime, so, you, hate, me, now, atthis, and, turn, towards, andromeda, sappho, 131, trans, edward, storer, in, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, scholars, began, to, interpret, sappho, as, involved, in, the, ritual, education, of, girls, for, instance, as, a, trainer, of, choruses, of, girls, though, not, all, of, her, poems, can, be, interpreted, in, this, light, lardinois, argues, that, this, is, the, most, plausible, social, context, to, site, sappho, in, another, interpretation, which, became, popular, in, the, twentieth, century, was, of, sappho, as, a, priestess, of, aphrodite, however, though, sappho, wrote, hymns, including, some, dedicated, to, aphrodite, there, is, no, evidence, that, she, held, a, priesthood, more, recent, scholars, have, proposed, that, sappho, was, part, of, a, circle, of, women, who, took, part, in, symposia, for, which, she, composed, and, performed, poetry, or, that, she, wrote, her, poetry, to, be, performed, at, men, s, symposia, though, her, songs, were, certainly, later, performed, at, symposia, there, is, no, external, evidence, for, archaic, greek, women, s, symposia, and, even, if, some, of, her, works, were, composed, for, a, sympotic, context, it, is, doubtful, that, the, cultic, hymns, or, poems, about, family, would, have, been, despite, scholars, best, attempts, to, find, one, yatromanolakis, argues, that, there, is, no, single, performance, context, to, which, all, of, sappho, s, poems, can, be, attributed, camillo, neri, argues, that, it, is, unnecessary, to, assign, all, of, her, poetry, to, one, context, and, suggests, that, she, could, have, composed, poetry, both, in, a, pedogogic, role, and, as, part, of, a, circle, of, friends, the, word, lesbian, is, an, allusion, to, sappho, originating, from, the, name, of, the, island, of, lesbos, where, she, was, born, however, though, in, modern, culture, sappho, is, seen, as, a, lesbian, she, has, not, always, been, considered, so, in, classical, athenian, comedy, from, the, old, comedy, of, the, fifth, century, to, menander, in, the, late, fourth, and, early, third, centuries, bc, sappho, was, caricatured, as, a, promiscuous, heterosexual, woman, and, the, earliest, surviving, sources, to, explicitly, discuss, sappho, s, homoeroticism, come, from, the, hellenistic, period, the, earliest, of, these, is, a, fragmentary, biography, written, on, papyrus, in, the, late, third, or, early, second, century, bc, which, states, that, sappho, was, accused, by, some, of, being, irregular, in, her, ways, and, a, woman, lover, denys, page, comments, that, the, phrase, by, some, implies, that, even, the, full, corpus, of, sappho, s, poetry, did, not, provide, conclusive, evidence, of, whether, she, described, herself, as, having, sex, with, women, these, ancient, authors, do, not, appear, to, have, believed, that, sappho, did, in, fact, have, sexual, relationships, with, other, women, and, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, the, suda, records, that, sappho, was, slanderously, accused, of, having, sexual, relationships, with, her, female, pupils, among, modern, scholars, sappho, s, sexuality, is, still, debated, andr, lardinois, has, described, it, as, the, great, sappho, question, early, translators, of, sappho, sometimes, heterosexualised, her, poetry, ambrose, philips, 1711, translation, of, the, ode, to, aphrodite, portrayed, the, object, of, sappho, s, desire, as, male, a, reading, that, was, followed, by, virtually, every, other, translator, of, the, poem, until, the, 20th, century, while, in, 1781, alessandro, verri, interpreted, fragment, 31, as, being, about, sappho, s, love, for, phaon, friedrich, gottlieb, welcker, argued, that, sappho, s, feelings, for, other, women, were, entirely, idealistic, and, non, sensual, while, karl, otfried, m, ller, wrote, that, fragment, 31, described, nothing, but, a, friendly, affection, glenn, most, comments, that, one, wonders, what, language, sappho, would, have, used, to, describe, her, feelings, if, they, had, been, ones, of, sexual, excitement, if, this, theory, were, correct, by, 1970, the, psychoanalyst, george, devereux, argued, that, the, same, poem, contained, proof, positive, of, lesbianism, today, it, is, generally, accepted, that, sappho, s, poetry, portrays, homoerotic, feelings, as, sandra, boehringer, puts, it, her, works, clearly, celebrate, eros, between, women, toward, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, though, some, scholars, began, to, reject, the, question, of, whether, sappho, was, a, lesbian, glenn, most, wrote, that, sappho, herself, would, have, had, no, idea, what, people, mean, when, they, call, her, nowadays, a, homosexual, andr, lardinois, stated, that, it, is, nonsensical, to, ask, whether, sappho, was, a, lesbian, and, page, dubois, calls, the, question, a, particularly, obfuscating, debate, some, scholars, argue, that, although, sappho, would, not, have, understood, modern, conceptions, of, sexuality, lesbianism, has, always, existed, and, she, was, fundamentally, a, lesbian, others, influenced, by, michel, foucault, s, work, on, the, history, of, sexuality, believe, that, it, is, incoherent, to, project, the, concept, of, lesbianism, onto, an, ancient, figure, like, sappho, melissa, mueller, argues, that, sappho, s, poetry, can, be, read, as, queer, even, if, the, question, of, her, lesbianism, is, undecidable, in, antiquity, sappho, s, poetry, was, highly, admired, and, several, ancient, sources, refer, to, her, as, the, tenth, muse, the, earliest, surviving, text, to, do, so, is, a, third, century, bc, epigram, by, dioscorides, but, poems, are, preserved, in, the, greek, anthology, by, antipater, of, sidon, and, attributed, to, plato, on, the, same, theme, she, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, poetess, just, as, homer, was, the, poet, the, scholars, of, alexandria, included, her, in, the, canon, of, nine, lyric, poets, according, to, aelian, the, athenian, lawmaker, and, poet, solon, asked, to, be, taught, a, song, by, sappho, so, that, i, may, learn, it, and, then, die, this, story, may, well, be, apocryphal, especially, as, ammianus, marcellinus, tells, a, similar, story, about, socrates, and, a, song, of, stesichorus, but, it, is, indicative, of, how, highly, sappho, s, poetry, was, considered, in, the, ancient, world, sappho, s, poetry, also, influenced, other, ancient, authors, plato, cites, sappho, in, his, phaedrus, and, socrates, second, speech, on, love, in, that, dialogue, appears, to, echo, sappho, s, descriptions, of, the, physical, effects, of, desire, in, fragment, 31, many, hellenistic, poets, alluded, to, or, adapted, sappho, s, works, the, locrian, poet, nossis, was, described, by, marilyn, b, skinner, as, an, imitator, of, sappho, and, kathryn, gutzwiller, argues, that, nossis, explicitly, positioned, herself, as, an, inheritor, of, sappho, s, position, as, a, female, poet, several, of, theocritus, poems, allude, to, sappho, including, idyll, 28, which, imitates, both, her, language, and, meter, poems, such, as, erinna, s, distaff, and, callimachus, lock, of, berenice, are, sapphic, in, theme, being, concerned, with, separation, erinna, from, her, childhood, friend, the, lock, of, berenice, s, hair, from, berenice, herself, in, the, first, century, bc, the, roman, poet, catullus, established, the, themes, and, metres, of, sappho, s, poetry, as, a, part, of, latin, literature, adopting, the, sapphic, stanza, believed, in, antiquity, to, have, been, invented, by, sappho, giving, his, lover, in, his, poetry, the, name, lesbia, in, reference, to, sappho, and, adapting, and, translating, sappho, s, 31st, fragment, in, his, poem, 51, fragment, 31, is, widely, referenced, in, latin, literature, as, well, as, by, catullus, it, is, alluded, to, by, authors, including, lucretius, in, the, de, rerum, natura, plautus, in, miles, gloriosus, and, virgil, in, book, 12, of, the, aeneid, latin, poets, also, referenced, other, fragments, the, section, on, eppia, in, juvenal, s, sixth, satire, references, fragment, 16, a, poem, in, sapphic, stanzas, from, statius, silvae, may, reference, the, ode, to, aphrodite, and, horace, s, ode, 3, 27, alludes, to, fragment, 94, other, ancient, poets, wrote, about, sappho, s, life, she, was, a, popular, character, in, ancient, athenian, comedy, and, at, least, six, separate, comedies, called, sappho, are, known, the, earliest, known, ancient, comedy, to, take, sappho, as, its, main, subject, was, the, early, fifth, or, late, fourth, century, bc, sappho, by, ameipsias, though, nothing, is, known, of, it, apart, from, its, name, as, these, comedies, survive, only, in, fragments, it, is, uncertain, exactly, how, they, portrayed, sappho, but, she, was, likely, characterised, as, a, promiscuous, woman, in, diphilos, play, she, was, the, lover, of, the, poets, anacreon, and, hipponax, sappho, was, also, a, favourite, subject, in, the, visual, arts, she, was, the, most, commonly, depicted, poet, on, sixth, and, fifth, century, attic, red, figure, vase, paintings, though, unlike, male, poets, such, as, anacreon, and, alcaeus, in, the, four, surviving, vases, in, which, she, is, identified, by, an, inscription, she, is, never, shown, singing, she, was, also, shown, on, coins, from, mytilene, and, eresos, from, the, first, to, third, centuries, ad, and, reportedly, depicted, in, a, sculpture, by, silanion, at, syracuse, statues, in, pergamon, and, constantinople, and, a, painting, by, the, hellenistic, artist, leon, from, the, fourth, century, bc, ancient, works, portray, sappho, as, a, tragic, heroine, driven, to, suicide, by, her, unrequited, love, for, phaon, a, fragment, of, a, play, by, menander, says, that, sappho, threw, herself, off, of, the, cliff, at, leucas, out, of, her, love, for, him, ovid, s, heroides, 15, is, written, as, a, letter, from, sappho, to, phaon, and, when, it, was, first, rediscovered, in, the, 15th, century, was, thought, to, be, a, translation, of, an, authentic, letter, by, sappho, sappho, s, suicide, was, also, depicted, in, classical, art, for, instance, on, the, first, century, bc, porta, maggiore, basilica, in, rome, while, sappho, s, poetry, was, admired, in, the, ancient, world, her, character, was, not, always, so, well, considered, in, the, roman, period, critics, found, her, lustful, and, perhaps, even, homosexual, horace, called, her, mascula, sappho, masculine, sappho, in, his, epistles, which, the, later, porphyrio, commented, was, either, because, she, is, famous, for, her, poetry, in, which, men, more, often, excel, or, because, she, is, maligned, for, having, been, a, tribad, by, the, third, century, ad, the, difference, between, sappho, s, literary, reputation, as, a, poet, and, her, moral, reputation, as, a, woman, had, become, so, significant, that, the, suggestion, that, there, were, in, fact, two, sapphos, began, to, develop, in, his, historical, miscellanies, aelian, wrote, that, there, was, another, sappho, a, courtesan, not, a, poetess, by, the, medieval, period, sappho, s, works, had, been, lost, though, she, was, still, quoted, in, later, authors, her, work, became, more, accessible, in, the, 16th, century, through, printed, editions, of, those, authors, who, had, quoted, her, in, 1508, aldus, manutius, printed, an, edition, of, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, which, contained, sappho, 1, the, ode, to, aphrodite, and, the, first, printed, edition, of, longinus, on, the, sublime, complete, with, his, quotation, of, sappho, 31, appeared, in, 1554, in, 1566, the, french, printer, robert, estienne, produced, an, edition, of, the, greek, lyric, poets, that, contained, around, 40, fragments, attributed, to, sappho, in, 1652, the, first, english, translation, of, a, poem, by, sappho, was, published, in, john, hall, s, translation, of, on, the, sublime, in, 1681, anne, le, f, vre, s, french, edition, of, sappho, made, her, work, even, more, widely, known, theodor, bergk, s, 1854, edition, became, the, standard, edition, of, sappho, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, first, part, of, the, 20th, century, the, papyrus, discoveries, of, new, poems, by, sappho, led, to, editions, and, translations, by, edwin, marion, cox, and, john, maxwell, edmonds, and, culminated, in, the, 1955, publication, of, edgar, lobel, s, and, denys, page, s, poetarum, lesbiorum, fragmenta, like, the, ancients, modern, critics, have, tended, to, consider, sappho, s, poetry, extraordinary, as, early, as, the, ninth, century, sappho, was, referred, to, as, a, talented, female, poet, and, in, works, such, as, boccaccio, s, de, claris, mulieribus, and, christine, de, pisan, s, book, of, the, city, of, ladies, she, gained, a, reputation, as, a, learned, lady, even, after, sappho, s, works, had, been, lost, the, sapphic, stanza, continued, to, be, used, in, medieval, lyric, poetry, and, with, the, rediscovery, of, her, work, in, the, renaissance, she, began, to, increasingly, influence, european, poetry, in, the, 16th, century, members, of, la, pl, iade, a, circle, of, french, poets, were, influenced, by, her, to, experiment, with, sapphic, stanzas, and, with, writing, love, poetry, with, a, first, person, female, voice, thy, soul, grown, delicate, with, satieties, atthis, o, atthis, i, long, for, thy, lips, i, long, for, thy, narrow, breasts, thou, restless, ungathered, ezra, pound, adaptation, of, sappho, 96, from, the, romantic, era, sappho, s, work, especially, her, ode, to, aphrodite, has, been, a, key, influence, of, conceptions, of, what, lyric, poetry, should, be, poets, such, as, alfred, lord, tennyson, in, the, 19th, century, and, a, e, housman, in, the, 20th, century, have, been, influenced, by, her, poetry, tennyson, based, poems, including, eleanore, and, fatima, on, sappho, s, fragment, 31, while, three, of, housman, s, works, are, adaptations, of, the, midnight, poem, long, thought, to, be, by, sappho, though, the, authorship, is, now, disputed, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, imagists, especially, ezra, pound, h, d, and, richard, aldington, were, influenced, by, sappho, s, fragments, a, number, of, pound, s, poems, in, his, early, collection, lustra, were, adaptations, of, sapphic, poems, while, h, d, s, poetry, frequently, echoed, sappho, stylistically, and, thematically, and, in, some, cases, such, as, fragment, 40, more, specifically, invoke, sappho, s, writing, western, classical, composers, have, also, been, inspired, by, sappho, the, story, of, sappho, and, phaon, began, to, appear, in, opera, in, the, late, 18th, century, for, example, in, simon, mayr, s, saffo, in, the, 19th, century, charles, gounod, s, sapho, and, giovanni, pacini, s, saffo, portrayed, a, sappho, involved, in, political, revolts, in, the, 20th, century, peggy, glanville, hicks, opera, sappho, was, based, on, the, play, by, lawrence, durrell, instrumental, works, inspired, by, sappho, include, chant, sapphique, by, camille, saint, sa, ns, and, the, percussion, piece, psappha, by, iannis, xenakis, composers, have, also, set, sappho, s, own, poetry, to, music, for, example, xenakis, a, s, which, uses, text, from, fragment, 95, and, charaxos, eos, and, tithonos, 2014, by, theodore, antoniou, based, on, the, 2014, discoveries, it, was, not, long, after, the, rediscovery, of, sappho, that, her, sexuality, once, again, became, the, focus, of, critical, attention, in, the, early, 17th, century, john, donne, wrote, sapho, to, philaenis, returning, to, the, idea, of, sappho, as, a, hypersexual, lover, of, women, the, modern, debate, on, sappho, s, sexuality, began, in, the, 19th, century, with, welcker, publishing, in, 1816, an, article, defending, sappho, from, charges, of, prostitution, and, lesbianism, arguing, that, she, was, chaste, a, position, that, was, later, taken, up, by, wilamowitz, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, and, henry, thornton, wharton, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, centuries, in, the, 19th, century, sappho, was, co, opted, by, charles, baudelaire, in, france, and, later, algernon, charles, swinburne, in, england, for, the, decadent, movement, the, critic, douglas, bush, characterised, swinburne, s, sadomasochistic, sappho, as, one, of, the, daughters, of, de, sade, the, french, author, known, for, his, violent, pornographic, books, by, the, late, 19th, century, lesbian, writers, such, as, michael, field, and, amy, levy, became, interested, in, sappho, for, her, sexuality, and, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, she, was, considered, a, patron, saint, of, lesbians, from, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, women, poets, such, as, felicia, hemans, the, last, song, of, sappho, and, letitia, elizabeth, landon, sketch, the, first, sappho, and, in, ideal, likenesses, took, sappho, as, one, of, their, progenitors, sappho, also, began, to, be, regarded, as, a, role, model, for, campaigners, for, women, s, rights, beginning, with, works, such, as, caroline, norton, s, the, picture, of, sappho, later, in, that, century, she, became, a, model, for, the, so, called, new, woman, independent, and, educated, women, who, desired, social, and, sexual, autonomy, and, by, the, 1960s, the, feminist, sappho, was, along, with, the, hypersexual, often, but, not, exclusively, lesbian, sappho, one, of, the, two, most, important, cultural, perceptions, of, her, the, discoveries, of, new, poems, by, sappho, in, 2004, and, 2014, excited, both, scholarly, and, media, attention, the, announcement, of, the, tithonus, poem, was, the, subject, of, international, news, coverage, and, was, described, by, marilyn, skinner, as, the, trouvaille, of, a, lifetime, the, publication, of, the, brothers, poem, a, decade, later, saw, further, news, coverage, and, discussion, on, social, media, while, m, l, west, described, the, 2014, discoveries, as, the, greatest, for, 92, years
