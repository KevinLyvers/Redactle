alfred, north, whitehead, om, frs, fba, 15, february, 1861, 30, december, 1947, was, an, english, mathematician, and, philosopher, he, created, the, philosophical, school, known, as, process, philosophy, which, has, been, applied, in, a, wide, variety, of, disciplines, including, ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and, psychology, in, his, early, career, whitehead, wrote, primarily, on, mathematics, logic, and, physics, he, wrote, the, three, volume, principia, mathematica, 1910, 1913, with, his, former, student, bertrand, russell, principia, mathematica, is, considered, one, of, the, twentieth, century, s, most, important, works, in, mathematical, logic, and, placed, 23rd, in, a, list, of, the, top, 100, english, language, nonfiction, books, of, the, twentieth, century, by, modern, library, beginning, in, the, late, 1910s, and, early, 1920s, whitehead, gradually, turned, his, attention, from, mathematics, to, philosophy, of, science, and, finally, to, metaphysics, he, developed, a, comprehensive, metaphysical, system, which, radically, departed, from, most, of, western, philosophy, whitehead, argued, that, reality, consists, of, processes, rather, than, material, objects, and, that, processes, are, best, defined, by, their, relations, with, other, processes, thus, rejecting, the, theory, that, reality, is, fundamentally, constructed, by, bits, of, matter, that, exist, independently, of, one, another, whitehead, s, philosophical, works, particularly, process, and, reality, are, regarded, as, the, foundational, texts, of, process, philosophy, whitehead, s, process, philosophy, argues, that, there, is, urgency, in, coming, to, see, the, world, as, a, web, of, interrelated, processes, of, which, we, are, integral, parts, so, that, all, of, our, choices, and, actions, have, consequences, for, the, world, around, us, for, this, reason, one, of, the, most, promising, applications, of, whitehead, s, thought, in, recent, years, has, been, in, the, area, of, ecological, civilization, and, environmental, ethics, pioneered, by, john, b, cobb, alfred, north, whitehead, was, born, in, ramsgate, kent, england, in, 1861, his, father, alfred, whitehead, became, an, anglican, minister, after, being, headmaster, of, chatham, house, academy, a, school, for, boys, previously, headed, by, alfred, s, father, thomas, whitehead, whitehead, himself, recalled, both, of, them, as, being, very, successful, school, masters, with, his, grandfather, being, the, more, remarkable, man, whitehead, s, mother, was, maria, sarah, buckmaster, her, maternal, great, grandmother, was, jane, north, 1776, 1847, whose, maiden, surname, was, given, to, whitehead, and, several, other, members, of, his, family, over, time, his, mother, maria, buckmaster, had, eleven, siblings, the, son, of, her, brother, thomas, walter, selby, buckmaster, was, twice, an, olympics, silver, medal, winner, for, polo, 1900, 1908, for, britain, and, is, said, to, be, one, of, the, finest, polo, players, england, has, ever, produced, whitehead, does, not, appear, to, have, been, close, to, his, mother, although, he, and, evelyn, full, name, evelyn, ada, maud, rice, willoughby, wade, whom, he, married, in, 1890, are, recorded, in, the, english, census, of, 1891, as, living, with, alfred, s, mother, and, father, lowe, notes, that, there, appears, to, have, been, mutual, dislike, between, whitehead, s, wife, evelyn, and, his, mother, maria, griffin, relates, how, bertrand, russell, a, colleague, and, collaborator, of, whitehead, was, a, very, close, friend, of, whitehead, and, of, his, wife, evelyn, griffin, retells, russell, s, story, of, how, one, evening, in, 1901, they, found, evelyn, whitehead, in, the, middle, of, what, appeared, to, be, a, dangerous, and, acutely, painful, angina, attack, it, seems, that, she, suffered, from, a, psychosomatic, disorder, the, danger, was, illusory, griffin, posits, that, russell, exaggerated, the, drama, of, her, illness, and, that, both, evelyn, and, russell, were, habitually, given, to, melodrama, intensity, of, emotion, was, encourgaged, by, their, avant, garde, associates, in, the, turbulent, bloomsbury, group, which, discussed, aesthetic, and, philosophical, questions, in, a, spirit, of, agnosticism, and, were, strongly, influenced, by, g, e, moore, s, principia, ethica, 1903, and, by, a, n, whitehead, s, and, bertrand, russell, s, principia, mathematica, 1910, 13, in, the, light, of, which, they, searched, for, definitions, of, the, good, the, true, and, the, beautiful, alfred, s, brother, henry, became, bishop, of, madras, and, wrote, the, closely, observed, ethnographic, account, village, gods, of, south, india, calcutta, association, press, 1921, whitehead, was, educated, at, sherborne, a, prominent, english, public, school, where, he, excelled, in, sports, and, mathematics, and, was, head, prefect, of, his, class, in, 1880, he, began, attending, trinity, college, cambridge, and, studied, mathematics, his, academic, advisor, was, edward, routh, he, earned, his, b, a, from, trinity, in, 1884, writing, his, dissertation, on, james, clerk, maxwell, s, a, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, and, graduated, as, fourth, wrangler, elected, a, fellow, of, trinity, in, 1884, whitehead, would, teach, and, write, on, mathematics, and, physics, at, the, college, until, 1910, spending, the, 1890s, writing, his, treatise, on, universal, algebra, 1898, and, the, 1900s, collaborating, with, his, former, pupil, bertrand, russell, on, the, first, edition, of, principia, mathematica, he, was, a, cambridge, apostle, in, 1910, whitehead, resigned, his, senior, lectureship, in, mathematics, at, trinity, and, moved, to, london, without, first, obtaining, another, job, after, being, unemployed, for, a, year, he, accepted, a, position, as, lecturer, in, applied, mathematics, and, mechanics, at, university, college, london, but, was, passed, over, a, year, later, for, the, goldsmid, chair, of, applied, mathematics, and, mechanics, a, position, for, which, he, had, hoped, to, be, seriously, considered, in, 1914, whitehead, accepted, a, position, as, professor, of, applied, mathematics, at, the, newly, chartered, imperial, college, london, where, his, old, friend, andrew, forsyth, had, recently, been, appointed, chief, professor, of, mathematics, in, 1918, whitehead, s, academic, responsibilities, began, to, seriously, expand, as, he, accepted, a, number, of, high, administrative, positions, within, the, university, of, london, system, of, which, imperial, college, london, was, a, member, at, the, time, he, was, elected, dean, of, the, faculty, of, science, at, the, university, of, london, in, late, 1918, a, post, he, held, for, four, years, a, member, of, the, university, of, london, s, senate, in, 1919, and, chairman, of, the, senate, s, academic, leadership, council, in, 1920, a, post, which, he, held, until, he, departed, for, america, in, 1924, whitehead, was, able, to, exert, his, newfound, influence, to, successfully, lobby, for, a, new, history, of, science, department, help, establish, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, previously, only, bachelor, of, arts, degrees, had, been, offered, and, make, the, school, more, accessible, to, less, wealthy, students, toward, the, end, of, his, time, in, england, whitehead, turned, his, attention, to, philosophy, though, he, had, no, advanced, training, in, philosophy, his, philosophical, work, soon, became, highly, regarded, after, publishing, the, concept, of, nature, in, 1920, he, served, as, president, of, the, aristotelian, society, from, 1922, to, 1923, in, 1924, henry, osborn, taylor, invited, the, 63, year, old, whitehead, to, join, the, faculty, at, harvard, university, as, a, professor, of, philosophy, the, whiteheads, would, spend, the, rest, of, their, lives, in, the, united, states, during, his, time, at, harvard, whitehead, produced, his, most, important, philosophical, contributions, in, 1925, he, wrote, science, and, the, modern, world, which, was, immediately, hailed, as, an, alternative, to, the, cartesian, dualism, then, prevalent, in, popular, science, he, was, elected, to, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, that, same, year, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1926, lectures, from, 1927, to, 1928, were, published, in, 1929, as, a, book, named, process, and, reality, which, has, been, compared, to, immanuel, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, in, 1890, whitehead, married, evelyn, wade, an, irishwoman, raised, in, france, they, had, a, daughter, jessie, and, two, sons, thomas, and, eric, thomas, followed, his, father, to, harvard, in, 1931, to, teach, at, the, business, school, eric, died, in, action, at, the, age, of, 19, while, serving, in, the, royal, flying, corps, during, world, war, i, from, 1910, the, whiteheads, had, a, cottage, in, the, village, of, lockeridge, near, marlborough, wiltshire, from, there, he, completed, principia, mathematica, the, whiteheads, remained, in, the, united, states, after, moving, to, harvard, in, 1924, alfred, retired, from, harvard, in, 1937, and, remained, in, cambridge, massachusetts, until, his, death, on, 30, december, 1947, the, two, volume, biography, of, whitehead, by, victor, lowe, is, the, most, definitive, presentation, of, the, life, of, whitehead, however, many, details, of, whitehead, s, life, remain, obscure, because, he, left, no, nachlass, personal, archive, his, family, carried, out, his, instructions, that, all, of, his, papers, be, destroyed, after, his, death, additionally, whitehead, was, known, for, his, almost, fanatical, belief, in, the, right, to, privacy, and, for, writing, very, few, personal, letters, of, the, kind, that, would, help, to, gain, insight, on, his, life, wrote, lowe, in, his, preface, no, professional, biographer, in, his, right, mind, would, touch, him, led, by, executive, editor, brian, g, henning, and, general, editor, george, r, lucas, jr, the, whitehead, research, project, of, the, center, for, process, studies, is, currently, working, on, a, critical, edition, of, whitehead, s, published, and, unpublished, works, the, first, volume, of, the, edinburgh, critical, edition, of, the, complete, works, of, alfred, north, whitehead, was, published, in, 2017, by, paul, a, bogaard, and, jason, bell, as, the, harvard, lectures, of, alfred, north, whitehead, 1924, 1925, the, philosophical, presuppositions, of, science, in, addition, to, numerous, articles, on, mathematics, whitehead, wrote, three, major, books, on, the, subject, a, treatise, on, universal, algebra, 1898, principia, mathematica, co, written, with, bertrand, russell, and, published, in, three, volumes, between, 1910, and, 1913, and, an, introduction, to, mathematics, 1911, the, former, two, books, were, aimed, exclusively, at, professional, mathematicians, while, the, latter, book, was, intended, for, a, larger, audience, covering, the, history, of, mathematics, and, its, philosophical, foundations, principia, mathematica, in, particular, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, mathematical, logic, of, the, 20th, century, in, addition, to, his, legacy, as, a, co, writer, of, principia, mathematica, whitehead, s, theory, of, extensive, abstraction, is, considered, foundational, for, the, branch, of, ontology, and, computer, science, known, as, mereotopology, a, theory, describing, spatial, relations, among, wholes, parts, parts, of, parts, and, the, boundaries, between, parts, in, a, treatise, on, universal, algebra, 1898, the, term, universal, algebra, had, essentially, the, same, meaning, that, it, has, today, the, study, of, algebraic, structures, themselves, rather, than, examples, models, of, algebraic, structures, whitehead, credits, william, rowan, hamilton, and, augustus, de, morgan, as, originators, of, the, subject, matter, and, james, joseph, sylvester, with, coining, the, term, itself, at, the, time, structures, such, as, lie, algebras, and, hyperbolic, quaternions, drew, attention, to, the, need, to, expand, algebraic, structures, beyond, the, associatively, multiplicative, class, in, a, review, alexander, macfarlane, wrote, the, main, idea, of, the, work, is, not, unification, of, the, several, methods, nor, generalization, of, ordinary, algebra, so, as, to, include, them, but, rather, the, comparative, study, of, their, several, structures, in, a, separate, review, g, b, mathews, wrote, it, possesses, a, unity, of, design, which, is, really, remarkable, considering, the, variety, of, its, themes, a, treatise, on, universal, algebra, sought, to, examine, hermann, grassmann, s, theory, of, extension, ausdehnungslehre, boole, s, algebra, of, logic, and, hamilton, s, quaternions, this, last, number, system, was, to, be, taken, up, in, volume, ii, which, was, never, finished, due, to, whitehead, s, work, on, principia, mathematica, whitehead, wrote, in, the, preface, such, algebras, have, an, intrinsic, value, for, separate, detailed, study, also, they, are, worthy, of, comparative, study, for, the, sake, of, the, light, thereby, thrown, on, the, general, theory, of, symbolic, reasoning, and, on, algebraic, symbolism, in, particular, the, idea, of, a, generalized, conception, of, space, has, been, made, prominent, in, the, belief, that, the, properties, and, operations, involved, in, it, can, be, made, to, form, a, uniform, method, of, interpretation, of, the, various, algebras, whitehead, however, had, no, results, of, a, general, nature, his, hope, of, form, a, uniform, method, of, interpretation, of, the, various, algebras, presumably, would, have, been, developed, in, volume, ii, had, whitehead, completed, it, further, work, on, the, subject, was, minimal, until, the, early, 1930s, when, garrett, birkhoff, and, ystein, ore, began, publishing, on, universal, algebras, principia, mathematica, 1910, 1913, is, whitehead, s, most, famous, mathematical, work, written, with, former, student, bertrand, russell, principia, mathematica, is, considered, one, of, the, twentieth, century, s, most, important, works, in, mathematics, and, placed, 23rd, in, a, list, of, the, top, 100, english, language, nonfiction, books, of, the, twentieth, century, by, modern, library, principia, mathematica, s, purpose, was, to, describe, a, set, of, axioms, and, inference, rules, in, symbolic, logic, from, which, all, mathematical, truths, could, in, principle, be, proven, whitehead, and, russell, were, working, on, such, a, foundational, level, of, mathematics, and, logic, that, it, took, them, until, page, 86, of, volume, ii, to, prove, that, 1, 1, 2, a, proof, humorously, accompanied, by, the, comment, the, above, proposition, is, occasionally, useful, whitehead, and, russell, had, thought, originally, that, principia, mathematica, would, take, a, year, to, complete, it, ended, up, taking, them, ten, years, when, it, came, time, for, publication, the, three, volume, work, was, so, long, more, than, 2, 000, pages, and, its, audience, so, narrow, professional, mathematicians, that, it, was, initially, published, at, a, loss, of, 600, pounds, 300, of, which, was, paid, by, cambridge, university, press, 200, by, the, royal, society, of, london, and, 50, apiece, by, whitehead, and, russell, themselves, despite, the, initial, loss, today, there, is, likely, no, major, academic, library, in, the, world, which, does, not, hold, a, copy, of, principia, mathematica, the, ultimate, substantive, legacy, of, principia, mathematica, is, mixed, it, is, generally, accepted, that, kurt, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorem, of, 1931, definitively, demonstrated, that, for, any, set, of, axioms, and, inference, rules, proposed, to, encapsulate, mathematics, there, would, in, fact, be, some, truths, of, mathematics, which, could, not, be, deduced, from, them, and, hence, that, principia, mathematica, could, never, achieve, its, aims, however, g, del, could, not, have, come, to, this, conclusion, without, whitehead, and, russell, s, book, in, this, way, principia, mathematica, s, legacy, might, be, described, as, its, key, role, in, disproving, the, possibility, of, achieving, its, own, stated, goals, but, beyond, this, somewhat, ironic, legacy, the, book, popularized, modern, mathematical, logic, and, drew, important, connections, between, logic, epistemology, and, metaphysics, unlike, whitehead, s, previous, two, books, on, mathematics, an, introduction, to, mathematics, 1911, was, not, aimed, exclusively, at, professional, mathematicians, but, was, intended, for, a, larger, audience, the, book, covered, the, nature, of, mathematics, its, unity, and, internal, structure, and, its, applicability, to, nature, whitehead, wrote, in, the, opening, chapter, the, object, of, the, following, chapters, is, not, to, teach, mathematics, but, to, enable, students, from, the, very, beginning, of, their, course, to, know, what, the, science, is, about, and, why, it, is, necessarily, the, foundation, of, exact, thought, as, applied, to, natural, phenomena, the, book, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, understand, the, growth, in, unity, and, interconnection, of, mathematics, as, a, whole, as, well, as, an, examination, of, the, mutual, influence, of, mathematics, and, philosophy, language, and, physics, although, the, book, is, little, read, in, some, ways, it, prefigures, certain, points, of, whitehead, s, later, work, in, philosophy, and, metaphysics, whitehead, showed, a, deep, concern, for, educational, reform, at, all, levels, in, addition, to, his, numerous, individually, written, works, on, the, subject, whitehead, was, appointed, by, britain, s, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, as, part, of, a, 20, person, committee, to, investigate, the, educational, systems, and, practices, of, the, uk, in, 1921, and, recommend, reform, whitehead, s, most, complete, work, on, education, is, the, 1929, book, the, aims, of, education, and, other, essays, which, collected, numerous, essays, and, addresses, by, whitehead, on, the, subject, published, between, 1912, and, 1927, the, essay, from, which, aims, of, education, derived, its, name, was, delivered, as, an, address, in, 1916, when, whitehead, was, president, of, the, london, branch, of, the, mathematical, association, in, it, he, cautioned, against, the, teaching, of, what, he, called, inert, ideas, ideas, that, are, disconnected, scraps, of, information, with, no, application, to, real, life, or, culture, he, opined, that, education, with, inert, ideas, is, not, only, useless, it, is, above, all, things, harmful, rather, than, teach, small, parts, of, a, large, number, of, subjects, whitehead, advocated, teaching, a, relatively, few, important, concepts, that, the, student, could, organically, link, to, many, different, areas, of, knowledge, discovering, their, application, in, actual, life, for, whitehead, education, should, be, the, exact, opposite, of, the, multidisciplinary, value, free, school, model, it, should, be, trans, disciplinary, and, laden, with, values, and, general, principles, that, provide, students, with, a, bedrock, of, wisdom, and, help, them, to, make, connections, between, areas, of, knowledge, that, are, usually, regarded, as, separate, in, order, to, make, this, sort, of, teaching, a, reality, however, whitehead, pointed, to, the, need, to, minimize, the, importance, of, or, radically, alter, standard, examinations, for, school, entrance, whitehead, writes, every, school, is, bound, on, pain, of, extinction, to, train, its, boys, for, a, small, set, of, definite, examinations, no, headmaster, has, a, free, hand, to, develop, his, general, education, or, his, specialist, studies, in, accordance, with, the, opportunities, of, his, school, which, are, created, by, its, staff, its, environment, its, class, of, boys, and, its, endowments, i, suggest, that, no, system, of, external, tests, which, aims, primarily, at, examining, individual, scholars, can, result, in, anything, but, educational, waste, whitehead, argued, that, curriculum, should, be, developed, specifically, for, its, own, students, by, its, own, staff, or, else, risk, total, stagnation, interrupted, only, by, occasional, movements, from, one, group, of, inert, ideas, to, another, above, all, else, in, his, educational, writings, whitehead, emphasized, the, importance, of, imagination, and, the, free, play, of, ideas, in, his, essay, universities, and, their, function, whitehead, writes, provocatively, on, imagination, imagination, is, not, to, be, divorced, from, the, facts, it, is, a, way, of, illuminating, the, facts, it, works, by, eliciting, the, general, principles, which, apply, to, the, facts, as, they, exist, and, then, by, an, intellectual, survey, of, alternative, possibilities, which, are, consistent, with, those, principles, it, enables, men, to, construct, an, intellectual, vision, of, a, new, world, whitehead, s, philosophy, of, education, might, adequately, be, summarized, in, his, statement, that, knowledge, does, not, keep, any, better, than, fish, in, other, words, bits, of, disconnected, knowledge, are, meaningless, all, knowledge, must, find, some, imaginative, application, to, the, students, own, lives, or, else, it, becomes, so, much, useless, trivia, and, the, students, themselves, become, good, at, parroting, facts, but, not, thinking, for, themselves, whitehead, did, not, begin, his, career, as, a, philosopher, in, fact, he, never, had, any, formal, training, in, philosophy, beyond, his, undergraduate, education, early, in, his, life, he, showed, great, interest, in, and, respect, for, philosophy, and, metaphysics, but, it, is, evident, that, he, considered, himself, a, rank, amateur, in, one, letter, to, his, friend, and, former, student, bertrand, russell, after, discussing, whether, science, aimed, to, be, explanatory, or, merely, descriptive, he, wrote, this, further, question, lands, us, in, the, ocean, of, metaphysic, onto, which, my, profound, ignorance, of, that, science, forbids, me, to, enter, ironically, in, later, life, whitehead, would, become, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, foremost, metaphysicians, however, interest, in, metaphysics, the, philosophical, investigation, of, the, nature, of, the, universe, and, existence, had, become, unfashionable, by, the, time, whitehead, began, writing, in, earnest, about, it, in, the, 1920s, the, ever, more, impressive, accomplishments, of, empirical, science, had, led, to, a, general, consensus, in, academia, that, the, development, of, comprehensive, metaphysical, systems, was, a, waste, of, time, because, they, were, not, subject, to, empirical, testing, whitehead, was, unimpressed, by, this, objection, in, the, notes, of, one, of, his, students, for, a, 1927, class, whitehead, was, quoted, as, saying, every, scientific, man, in, order, to, preserve, his, reputation, has, to, say, he, dislikes, metaphysics, what, he, means, is, he, dislikes, having, his, metaphysics, criticized, in, whitehead, s, view, scientists, and, philosophers, make, metaphysical, assumptions, about, how, the, universe, works, all, the, time, but, such, assumptions, are, not, easily, seen, precisely, because, they, remain, unexamined, and, unquestioned, while, whitehead, acknowledged, that, philosophers, can, never, hope, finally, to, formulate, these, metaphysical, first, principles, he, argued, that, people, need, to, continually, reimagine, their, basic, assumptions, about, how, the, universe, works, if, philosophy, and, science, are, to, make, any, real, progress, even, if, that, progress, remains, permanently, asymptotic, for, this, reason, whitehead, regarded, metaphysical, investigations, as, essential, to, both, good, science, and, good, philosophy, perhaps, foremost, among, what, whitehead, considered, faulty, metaphysical, assumptions, was, the, cartesian, idea, that, reality, is, fundamentally, constructed, of, bits, of, matter, that, exist, totally, independently, of, one, another, which, he, rejected, in, favour, of, an, event, based, or, process, ontology, in, which, events, are, primary, and, are, fundamentally, interrelated, and, dependent, on, one, another, he, also, argued, that, the, most, basic, elements, of, reality, can, all, be, regarded, as, experiential, indeed, that, everything, is, constituted, by, its, experience, he, used, the, term, experience, very, broadly, so, that, even, inanimate, processes, such, as, electron, collisions, are, said, to, manifest, some, degree, of, experience, in, this, he, went, against, descartes, separation, of, two, different, kinds, of, real, existence, either, exclusively, material, or, else, exclusively, mental, whitehead, referred, to, his, metaphysical, system, as, philosophy, of, organism, but, it, would, become, known, more, widely, as, process, philosophy, whitehead, s, philosophy, was, highly, original, and, soon, garnered, interest, in, philosophical, circles, after, publishing, the, concept, of, nature, in, 1920, he, served, as, president, of, the, aristotelian, society, from, 1922, to, 1923, and, henri, bergson, was, quoted, as, saying, that, whitehead, was, the, best, philosopher, writing, in, english, so, impressive, and, different, was, whitehead, s, philosophy, that, in, 1924, he, was, invited, to, join, the, faculty, at, harvard, university, as, a, professor, of, philosophy, at, 63, years, of, age, this, is, not, to, say, that, whitehead, s, thought, was, widely, accepted, or, even, well, understood, his, philosophical, work, is, generally, considered, to, be, among, the, most, difficult, to, understand, in, all, of, the, western, canon, even, professional, philosophers, struggled, to, follow, whitehead, s, writings, one, famous, story, illustrating, the, level, of, difficulty, of, whitehead, s, philosophy, centres, around, the, delivery, of, whitehead, s, gifford, lectures, in, 1927, 28, following, arthur, eddington, s, lectures, of, the, year, previous, which, whitehead, would, later, publish, as, process, and, reality, eddington, was, a, marvellous, popular, lecturer, who, had, enthralled, an, audience, of, 600, for, his, entire, course, the, same, audience, turned, up, to, whitehead, s, first, lecture, but, it, was, completely, unintelligible, not, merely, to, the, world, at, large, but, to, the, elect, my, father, remarked, to, me, afterwards, that, if, he, had, not, known, whitehead, well, he, would, have, suspected, that, it, was, an, imposter, making, it, up, as, he, went, along, the, audience, at, subsequent, lectures, was, only, about, half, a, dozen, in, all, it, may, not, be, inappropriate, to, speculate, that, some, fair, portion, of, the, respect, generally, shown, to, whitehead, by, his, philosophical, peers, at, the, time, arose, from, their, sheer, bafflement, the, chicago, theologian, shailer, mathews, once, remarked, of, whitehead, s, 1926, book, religion, in, the, making, it, is, infuriating, and, i, must, say, embarrassing, as, well, to, read, page, after, page, of, relatively, familiar, words, without, understanding, a, single, sentence, however, mathews, frustration, with, whitehead, s, books, did, not, negatively, affect, his, interest, in, fact, there, were, numerous, philosophers, and, theologians, at, chicago, s, divinity, school, that, perceived, the, importance, of, what, whitehead, was, doing, without, fully, grasping, all, of, the, details, and, implications, in, 1927, they, invited, one, of, america, s, only, whitehead, experts, henry, nelson, wieman, to, chicago, to, give, a, lecture, explaining, whitehead, s, thoughts, wieman, s, lecture, was, so, brilliant, that, he, was, promptly, hired, to, the, faculty, and, taught, there, for, twenty, years, and, for, at, least, thirty, years, afterwards, chicago, s, divinity, school, was, closely, associated, with, whitehead, s, thought, shortly, after, whitehead, s, book, process, and, reality, appeared, in, 1929, wieman, famously, wrote, in, his, 1930, review, not, many, people, will, read, whitehead, s, recent, book, in, this, generation, not, many, will, read, it, in, any, generation, but, its, influence, will, radiate, through, concentric, circles, of, popularization, until, the, common, man, will, think, and, work, in, the, light, of, it, not, knowing, whence, the, light, came, after, a, few, decades, of, discussion, and, analysis, one, will, be, able, to, understand, it, more, readily, than, can, now, be, done, wieman, s, words, proved, prophetic, though, process, and, reality, has, been, called, arguably, the, most, impressive, single, metaphysical, text, of, the, twentieth, century, it, has, been, little, read, and, little, understood, partly, because, it, demands, as, isabelle, stengers, puts, it, that, its, readers, accept, the, adventure, of, the, questions, that, will, separate, them, from, every, consensus, whitehead, questioned, western, philosophy, s, most, dearly, held, assumptions, about, how, the, universe, works, but, in, doing, so, he, managed, to, anticipate, a, number, of, 21st, century, scientific, and, philosophical, problems, and, provide, novel, solutions, whitehead, was, convinced, that, the, scientific, notion, of, matter, was, misleading, as, a, way, of, describing, the, ultimate, nature, of, things, in, his, 1925, book, science, and, the, modern, world, he, wrote, that, there, persists, fixed, scientific, cosmology, which, presupposes, the, ultimate, fact, of, an, irreducible, brute, matter, or, material, spread, through, space, in, a, flux, of, configurations, in, itself, such, a, material, is, senseless, valueless, purposeless, it, just, does, what, it, does, do, following, a, fixed, routine, imposed, by, external, relations, which, do, not, spring, from, the, nature, of, its, being, it, is, this, assumption, that, i, call, scientific, materialism, also, it, is, an, assumption, which, i, shall, challenge, as, being, entirely, unsuited, to, the, scientific, situation, at, which, we, have, now, arrived, in, whitehead, s, view, there, are, a, number, of, problems, with, this, notion, of, irreducible, brute, matter, first, it, obscures, and, minimizes, the, importance, of, change, by, thinking, of, any, material, thing, like, a, rock, or, a, person, as, being, fundamentally, the, same, thing, throughout, time, with, any, changes, to, it, being, secondary, to, its, nature, scientific, materialism, hides, the, fact, that, nothing, ever, stays, the, same, for, whitehead, change, is, fundamental, and, inescapable, he, emphasizes, that, all, things, flow, in, whitehead, s, view, then, concepts, such, as, quality, matter, and, form, are, problematic, these, classical, concepts, fail, to, adequately, account, for, change, and, overlook, the, active, and, experiential, nature, of, the, most, basic, elements, of, the, world, they, are, useful, abstractions, but, are, not, the, world, s, basic, building, blocks, what, is, ordinarily, conceived, of, as, a, single, person, for, instance, is, philosophically, described, as, a, continuum, of, overlapping, events, after, all, people, change, all, the, time, if, only, because, they, have, aged, by, another, second, and, had, some, further, experience, these, occasions, of, experience, are, logically, distinct, but, are, progressively, connected, in, what, whitehead, calls, a, society, of, events, by, assuming, that, enduring, objects, are, the, most, real, and, fundamental, things, in, the, universe, materialists, have, mistaken, the, abstract, for, the, concrete, what, whitehead, calls, the, fallacy, of, misplaced, concreteness, to, put, it, another, way, a, thing, or, person, is, often, seen, as, having, a, defining, essence, or, a, core, identity, that, is, unchanging, and, describes, what, the, thing, or, person, really, is, in, this, way, of, thinking, things, and, people, are, seen, as, fundamentally, the, same, through, time, with, any, changes, being, qualitative, and, secondary, to, their, core, identity, e, g, mark, s, hair, has, turned, grey, as, he, has, gotten, older, but, he, is, still, the, same, person, but, in, whitehead, s, cosmology, the, only, fundamentally, existent, things, are, discrete, occasions, of, experience, that, overlap, one, another, in, time, and, space, and, jointly, make, up, the, enduring, person, or, thing, on, the, other, hand, what, ordinary, thinking, often, regards, as, the, essence, of, a, thing, or, the, identity, core, of, a, person, is, an, abstract, generalization, of, what, is, regarded, as, that, person, or, thing, s, most, important, or, salient, features, across, time, identities, do, not, define, people, people, define, identities, everything, changes, from, moment, to, moment, and, to, think, of, anything, as, having, an, enduring, essence, misses, the, fact, that, all, things, flow, though, it, is, often, a, useful, way, of, speaking, whitehead, pointed, to, the, limitations, of, language, as, one, of, the, main, culprits, in, maintaining, a, materialistic, way, of, thinking, and, acknowledged, that, it, may, be, difficult, to, ever, wholly, move, past, such, ideas, in, everyday, speech, after, all, every, moment, of, each, person, s, life, can, hardly, be, given, a, different, proper, name, and, it, is, easy, and, convenient, to, think, of, people, and, objects, as, remaining, fundamentally, the, same, things, rather, than, constantly, keeping, in, mind, that, each, thing, is, a, different, thing, from, what, it, was, a, moment, ago, yet, the, limitations, of, everyday, living, and, everyday, speech, should, not, prevent, people, from, realizing, that, material, substances, or, essences, are, a, convenient, generalized, description, of, a, continuum, of, particular, concrete, processes, no, one, questions, that, a, ten, year, old, person, is, quite, different, by, the, time, he, or, she, turns, thirty, years, old, and, in, many, ways, is, not, the, same, person, at, all, whitehead, points, out, that, it, is, not, philosophically, or, ontologically, sound, to, think, that, a, person, is, the, same, from, one, second, to, the, next, a, second, problem, with, materialism, is, that, it, obscures, the, importance, of, relations, it, sees, every, object, as, distinct, and, discrete, from, all, other, objects, each, object, is, simply, an, inert, clump, of, matter, that, is, only, externally, related, to, other, things, the, idea, of, matter, as, primary, makes, people, think, of, objects, as, being, fundamentally, separate, in, time, and, space, and, not, necessarily, related, to, anything, but, in, whitehead, s, view, relations, take, a, primary, role, perhaps, even, more, important, than, the, relata, themselves, a, student, taking, notes, in, one, of, whitehead, s, fall, 1924, classes, wrote, that, reality, applies, to, connections, and, only, relatively, to, the, things, connected, a, is, real, for, b, and, b, is, real, for, a, but, not, absolutely, real, independent, of, each, other, in, fact, whitehead, describes, any, entity, as, in, some, sense, nothing, more, and, nothing, less, than, the, sum, of, its, relations, to, other, entities, its, synthesis, of, and, reaction, to, the, world, around, it, a, real, thing, is, just, that, which, forces, the, rest, of, the, universe, to, in, some, way, conform, to, it, that, is, to, say, if, theoretically, a, thing, made, strictly, no, difference, to, any, other, entity, i, e, it, was, not, related, to, any, other, entity, it, could, not, be, said, to, really, exist, relations, are, not, secondary, to, what, a, thing, is, they, are, what, the, thing, is, to, whitehead, an, entity, is, not, merely, a, sum, of, its, relations, but, also, a, valuation, of, them, and, reaction, to, them, for, whitehead, creativity, is, the, absolute, principle, of, existence, and, every, entity, whether, it, is, a, human, being, a, tree, or, an, electron, has, some, degree, of, novelty, in, how, it, responds, to, other, entities, and, is, not, fully, determined, by, causal, or, mechanistic, laws, most, entities, do, not, have, consciousness, as, a, human, being, s, actions, cannot, always, be, predicted, the, same, can, be, said, of, where, a, tree, s, roots, will, grow, or, how, an, electron, will, move, or, whether, it, will, rain, tomorrow, moreover, the, inability, to, predict, an, electron, s, movement, for, instance, is, not, due, to, faulty, understanding, or, inadequate, technology, rather, the, fundamental, creativity, freedom, of, all, entities, means, that, there, will, always, remain, phenomena, that, are, unpredictable, the, other, side, of, creativity, freedom, as, the, absolute, principle, is, that, every, entity, is, constrained, by, the, social, structure, of, existence, i, e, its, relations, each, actual, entity, must, conform, to, the, settled, conditions, of, the, world, around, it, freedom, always, exists, within, limits, but, an, entity, s, uniqueness, and, individuality, arise, from, its, own, self, determination, as, to, just, how, it, will, take, account, of, the, world, within, the, limits, that, have, been, set, for, it, in, summary, whitehead, rejects, the, idea, of, separate, and, unchanging, bits, of, matter, as, the, most, basic, building, blocks, of, reality, in, favour, of, the, idea, of, reality, as, interrelated, events, in, the, process, he, conceives, of, reality, as, composed, of, processes, of, dynamic, becoming, rather, than, static, being, emphasizing, that, all, physical, things, change, and, evolve, and, that, changeless, essences, such, as, matter, are, mere, abstractions, from, the, interrelated, events, that, are, the, final, real, things, that, make, up, the, world, since, whitehead, s, metaphysics, described, a, universe, in, which, all, entities, experience, he, needed, a, new, way, of, describing, perception, that, was, not, limited, to, living, self, conscious, beings, the, term, he, coined, was, prehension, which, comes, from, the, latin, prehensio, meaning, to, seize, the, term, is, meant, to, indicate, a, kind, of, perception, that, can, be, conscious, or, unconscious, applying, to, people, as, well, as, electrons, it, is, also, intended, to, make, clear, whitehead, s, rejection, of, the, theory, of, representative, perception, in, which, the, mind, only, has, private, ideas, about, other, entities, for, whitehead, the, term, prehension, indicates, that, the, perceiver, actually, incorporates, aspects, of, the, perceived, thing, into, itself, in, this, way, entities, are, constituted, by, their, perceptions, and, relations, rather, than, being, independent, of, them, further, whitehead, regards, perception, as, occurring, in, two, modes, causal, efficacy, or, physical, prehension, and, presentational, immediacy, or, conceptual, prehension, whitehead, describes, causal, efficacy, as, the, experience, dominating, the, primitive, living, organisms, which, have, a, sense, for, the, fate, from, which, they, have, emerged, and, the, fate, towards, which, they, go, it, is, in, other, words, the, sense, of, causal, relations, between, entities, a, feeling, of, being, influenced, and, affected, by, the, surrounding, environment, unmediated, by, the, senses, presentational, immediacy, on, the, other, hand, is, what, is, usually, referred, to, as, pure, sense, perception, unmediated, by, any, causal, or, symbolic, interpretation, even, unconscious, interpretation, in, other, words, it, is, pure, appearance, which, may, or, may, not, be, delusive, e, g, mistaking, an, image, in, a, mirror, for, the, real, thing, in, higher, organisms, like, people, these, two, modes, of, perception, combine, into, what, whitehead, terms, symbolic, reference, which, links, appearance, with, causation, in, a, process, that, is, so, automatic, that, both, people, and, animals, have, difficulty, refraining, from, it, by, way, of, illustration, whitehead, uses, the, example, of, a, person, s, encounter, with, a, chair, an, ordinary, person, looks, up, sees, a, coloured, shape, and, immediately, infers, that, it, is, a, chair, however, an, artist, whitehead, supposes, might, not, have, jumped, to, the, notion, of, a, chair, but, instead, might, have, stopped, at, the, mere, contemplation, of, a, beautiful, colour, and, a, beautiful, shape, this, is, not, the, normal, human, reaction, most, people, place, objects, in, categories, by, habit, and, instinct, without, even, thinking, about, it, moreover, animals, do, the, same, thing, using, the, same, example, whitehead, points, out, that, a, dog, would, have, acted, immediately, on, the, hypothesis, of, a, chair, and, would, have, jumped, onto, it, by, way, of, using, it, as, such, in, this, way, symbolic, reference, is, a, fusion, of, pure, sense, perceptions, on, the, one, hand, and, causal, relations, on, the, other, and, it, is, in, fact, the, causal, relationships, that, dominate, the, more, basic, mentality, as, the, dog, illustrates, while, it, is, the, sense, perceptions, which, indicate, a, higher, grade, mentality, as, the, artist, illustrates, whitehead, believed, that, when, asking, questions, about, the, basic, facts, of, existence, questions, about, value, and, purpose, can, never, be, fully, escaped, this, is, borne, out, in, his, thoughts, on, abiogenesis, or, the, hypothetical, natural, process, by, which, life, arises, from, simple, organic, compounds, whitehead, makes, the, startling, observation, that, life, is, comparatively, deficient, in, survival, value, if, humans, can, only, exist, for, about, a, hundred, years, and, rocks, for, eight, hundred, million, then, one, is, forced, to, ask, why, complex, organisms, ever, evolved, in, the, first, place, as, whitehead, humorously, notes, they, certainly, did, not, appear, because, they, were, better, at, that, game, than, the, rocks, around, them, he, then, observes, that, the, mark, of, higher, forms, of, life, is, that, they, are, actively, engaged, in, modifying, their, environment, an, activity, which, he, theorizes, is, directed, toward, the, three, fold, goal, of, living, living, well, and, living, better, in, other, words, whitehead, sees, life, as, directed, toward, the, purpose, of, increasing, its, own, satisfaction, without, such, a, goal, he, sees, the, rise, of, life, as, totally, unintelligible, for, whitehead, there, is, no, such, thing, as, wholly, inert, matter, instead, all, things, have, some, measure, of, freedom, or, creativity, however, small, which, allows, them, to, be, at, least, partly, self, directed, the, process, philosopher, david, ray, griffin, coined, the, term, panexperientialism, the, idea, that, all, entities, experience, to, describe, whitehead, s, view, and, to, distinguish, it, from, panpsychism, the, idea, that, all, matter, has, consciousness, whitehead, s, idea, of, god, differs, from, traditional, monotheistic, notions, perhaps, his, most, famous, and, pointed, criticism, of, the, christian, conception, of, god, is, that, the, church, gave, unto, god, the, attributes, which, belonged, exclusively, to, caesar, here, whitehead, is, criticizing, christianity, for, defining, god, as, primarily, a, divine, king, who, imposes, his, will, on, the, world, and, whose, most, important, attribute, is, power, as, opposed, to, the, most, widely, accepted, forms, of, christianity, whitehead, emphasized, an, idea, of, god, that, he, called, the, brief, galilean, vision, of, humility, it, does, not, emphasize, the, ruling, caesar, or, the, ruthless, moralist, or, the, unmoved, mover, it, dwells, upon, the, tender, elements, in, the, world, which, slowly, and, in, quietness, operates, by, love, and, it, finds, purpose, in, the, present, immediacy, of, a, kingdom, not, of, this, world, love, neither, rules, nor, is, it, unmoved, also, it, is, a, little, oblivious, as, to, morals, it, does, not, look, to, the, future, for, it, finds, its, own, reward, in, the, immediate, present, for, whitehead, god, is, not, necessarily, tied, to, religion, rather, than, springing, primarily, from, religious, faith, whitehead, saw, god, as, necessary, for, his, metaphysical, system, his, system, required, that, an, order, exist, among, possibilities, an, order, that, allowed, for, novelty, in, the, world, and, provided, an, aim, to, all, entities, whitehead, posited, that, these, ordered, potentials, exist, in, what, he, called, the, primordial, nature, of, god, however, whitehead, was, also, interested, in, religious, experience, this, led, him, to, reflect, more, intensively, on, what, he, saw, as, the, second, nature, of, god, the, consequent, nature, whitehead, s, conception, of, god, as, a, dipolar, entity, has, called, for, fresh, theological, thinking, the, primordial, nature, he, described, as, the, unlimited, conceptual, realization, of, the, absolute, wealth, of, potentiality, i, e, the, unlimited, possibility, of, the, universe, this, primordial, nature, is, eternal, and, unchanging, providing, entities, in, the, universe, with, possibilities, for, realization, whitehead, also, calls, this, primordial, aspect, the, lure, for, feeling, the, eternal, urge, of, desire, pulling, the, entities, in, the, universe, toward, as, yet, unrealized, possibilities, god, s, consequent, nature, on, the, other, hand, is, anything, but, unchanging, it, is, god, s, reception, of, the, world, s, activity, as, whitehead, puts, it, saves, the, world, as, it, passes, into, the, immediacy, of, his, own, life, it, is, the, judgment, of, a, tenderness, which, loses, nothing, that, can, be, saved, in, other, words, god, saves, and, cherishes, all, experiences, forever, and, those, experiences, go, on, to, change, the, way, god, interacts, with, the, world, in, this, way, god, is, really, changed, by, what, happens, in, the, world, and, the, wider, universe, lending, the, actions, of, finite, creatures, an, eternal, significance, whitehead, thus, sees, god, and, the, world, as, fulfilling, one, another, he, sees, entities, in, the, world, as, fluent, and, changing, things, that, yearn, for, a, permanence, which, only, god, can, provide, by, taking, them, into, god, s, self, thereafter, changing, god, and, affecting, the, rest, of, the, universe, throughout, time, on, the, other, hand, he, sees, god, as, permanent, but, as, deficient, in, actuality, and, change, alone, god, is, merely, eternally, unrealized, possibilities, and, requires, the, world, to, actualize, them, god, gives, creatures, permanence, while, the, creatures, give, god, actuality, and, change, here, it, is, worthwhile, to, quote, whitehead, at, length, in, this, way, god, is, completed, by, the, individual, fluent, satisfactions, of, finite, fact, and, the, temporal, occasions, are, completed, by, their, everlasting, union, with, their, transformed, selves, purged, into, conformation, with, the, eternal, order, which, is, the, final, absolute, wisdom, the, final, summary, can, only, be, expressed, in, terms, of, a, group, of, antitheses, whose, apparent, self, contradictions, depend, on, neglect, of, the, diverse, categories, of, existence, in, each, antithesis, there, is, a, shift, of, meaning, which, converts, the, opposition, into, a, contrast, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, god, is, permanent, and, the, world, fluent, as, that, the, world, is, permanent, and, god, is, fluent, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, god, is, one, and, the, world, many, as, that, the, world, is, one, and, god, many, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, in, comparison, with, the, world, god, is, actual, eminently, as, that, in, comparison, with, god, the, world, is, actual, eminently, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, the, world, is, immanent, in, god, as, that, god, is, immanent, in, the, world, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, god, transcends, the, world, as, that, the, world, transcends, god, it, is, as, true, to, say, that, god, creates, the, world, as, that, the, world, creates, god, what, is, done, in, the, world, is, transformed, into, a, reality, in, heaven, and, the, reality, in, heaven, passes, back, into, the, world, in, this, sense, god, is, the, great, companion, the, fellow, sufferer, who, understands, the, above, is, some, of, whitehead, s, most, evocative, writing, about, god, and, was, powerful, enough, to, inspire, the, movement, known, as, process, theology, a, vibrant, theological, school, of, thought, that, continues, to, thrive, today, for, whitehead, the, core, of, religion, was, individual, while, he, acknowledged, that, individuals, cannot, ever, be, fully, separated, from, their, society, he, argued, that, life, is, an, internal, fact, for, its, own, sake, before, it, is, an, external, fact, relating, to, others, his, most, famous, remark, on, religion, is, that, religion, is, what, the, individual, does, with, his, own, solitariness, and, if, you, are, never, solitary, you, are, never, religious, whitehead, saw, religion, as, a, system, of, general, truths, that, transformed, a, person, s, character, he, took, special, care, to, note, that, while, religion, is, often, a, good, influence, it, is, not, necessarily, good, an, idea, which, he, called, a, dangerous, delusion, e, g, a, religion, might, encourage, the, violent, extermination, of, a, rival, religion, s, adherents, however, while, whitehead, saw, religion, as, beginning, in, solitariness, he, also, saw, religion, as, necessarily, expanding, beyond, the, individual, in, keeping, with, his, process, metaphysics, in, which, relations, are, primary, he, wrote, that, religion, necessitates, the, realization, of, the, value, of, the, objective, world, which, is, a, community, derivative, from, the, interrelations, of, its, component, individuals, in, other, words, the, universe, is, a, community, which, makes, itself, whole, through, the, relatedness, of, each, individual, entity, to, all, the, others, meaning, and, value, do, not, exist, for, the, individual, alone, but, only, in, the, context, of, the, universal, community, whitehead, writes, further, that, each, entity, can, find, no, such, value, till, it, has, merged, its, individual, claim, with, that, of, the, objective, universe, religion, is, world, loyalty, the, spirit, at, once, surrenders, itself, to, this, universal, claim, and, appropriates, it, for, itself, in, this, way, the, individual, and, universal, social, aspects, of, religion, are, mutually, dependent, a, connection, between, the, works, of, william, dewitt, hyde, and, whitehead, further, elucidates, this, necessary, duality, of, social, and, individual, roles, in, religious, experience, whitehead, also, described, religion, more, technically, as, an, ultimate, craving, to, infuse, into, the, insistent, particularity, of, emotion, that, non, temporal, generality, which, primarily, belongs, to, conceptual, thought, alone, in, other, words, religion, takes, deeply, felt, emotions, and, contextualizes, them, within, a, system, of, general, truths, about, the, world, helping, people, to, identify, their, wider, meaning, and, significance, for, whitehead, religion, served, as, a, kind, of, bridge, between, philosophy, and, the, emotions, and, purposes, of, a, particular, society, it, is, the, task, of, religion, to, make, philosophy, applicable, to, the, everyday, lives, of, ordinary, people, isabelle, stengers, wrote, that, whiteheadians, are, recruited, among, both, philosophers, and, theologians, and, the, palette, has, been, enriched, by, practitioners, from, the, most, diverse, horizons, from, ecology, to, feminism, practices, that, unite, political, struggle, and, spirituality, with, the, sciences, of, education, in, recent, decades, attention, to, whitehead, s, work, has, become, more, widespread, with, interest, extending, to, intellectuals, in, europe, and, china, and, coming, from, such, diverse, fields, as, ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and, psychology, one, of, the, first, theologians, to, attempt, to, interact, with, whitehead, s, thought, was, the, future, archbishop, of, canterbury, william, temple, in, temple, s, gifford, lectures, of, 1932, 1934, subsequently, published, as, nature, man, and, god, whitehead, is, one, of, a, number, of, philosophers, of, the, emergent, evolution, approach, with, which, temple, interacts, however, it, was, not, until, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, that, whitehead, s, thought, drew, much, attention, outside, of, a, small, group, of, philosophers, and, theologians, primarily, americans, and, even, today, he, is, not, considered, especially, influential, outside, of, relatively, specialized, circles, early, followers, of, whitehead, were, found, primarily, at, the, university, of, chicago, divinity, school, where, henry, nelson, wieman, initiated, an, interest, in, whitehead, s, work, that, would, last, for, about, thirty, years, professors, such, as, wieman, charles, hartshorne, bernard, loomer, bernard, meland, and, daniel, day, williams, made, whitehead, s, philosophy, arguably, the, most, important, intellectual, thread, running, through, the, divinity, school, they, taught, generations, of, whitehead, scholars, the, most, notable, of, whom, is, john, b, cobb, although, interest, in, whitehead, has, since, faded, at, chicago, s, divinity, school, cobb, effectively, grabbed, the, torch, and, planted, it, firmly, in, claremont, california, where, he, began, teaching, at, claremont, school, of, theology, in, 1958, and, founded, the, center, for, process, studies, with, david, ray, griffin, in, 1973, largely, due, to, cobb, s, influence, today, claremont, remains, strongly, identified, with, whitehead, s, process, thought, but, while, claremont, remains, the, most, concentrated, hub, of, whiteheadian, activity, the, place, where, whitehead, s, thought, currently, seems, to, be, growing, the, most, quickly, is, in, china, in, order, to, address, the, challenges, of, modernization, and, industrialization, china, has, begun, to, blend, traditions, of, taoism, buddhism, and, confucianism, with, whitehead, s, constructive, post, modern, philosophy, in, order, to, create, an, ecological, civilization, to, date, the, chinese, government, has, encouraged, the, building, of, twenty, three, university, based, centres, for, the, study, of, whitehead, s, philosophy, and, books, by, process, philosophers, john, cobb, and, david, ray, griffin, are, becoming, required, reading, for, chinese, graduate, students, cobb, has, attributed, china, s, interest, in, process, philosophy, partly, to, whitehead, s, stress, on, the, mutual, interdependence, of, humanity, and, nature, as, well, as, his, emphasis, on, an, educational, system, that, includes, the, teaching, of, values, rather, than, simply, bare, facts, overall, however, whitehead, s, influence, is, very, difficult, to, characterize, in, english, speaking, countries, his, primary, works, are, little, studied, outside, of, claremont, and, a, select, number, of, liberal, graduate, level, theology, and, philosophy, programs, outside, of, these, circles, his, influence, is, relatively, small, and, diffuse, and, has, tended, to, come, chiefly, through, the, work, of, his, students, and, admirers, rather, than, whitehead, himself, for, instance, whitehead, was, a, teacher, and, long, time, friend, and, collaborator, of, bertrand, russell, and, he, also, taught, and, supervised, the, dissertation, of, willard, van, orman, quine, both, of, whom, are, important, figures, in, analytic, philosophy, the, dominant, strain, of, philosophy, in, english, speaking, countries, in, the, 20th, century, whitehead, has, also, had, high, profile, admirers, in, the, continental, tradition, such, as, french, post, structuralist, philosopher, gilles, deleuze, who, once, dryly, remarked, of, whitehead, that, he, stands, provisionally, as, the, last, great, anglo, american, philosopher, before, wittgenstein, s, disciples, spread, their, misty, confusion, sufficiency, and, terror, french, sociologist, and, anthropologist, bruno, latour, even, went, so, far, as, to, call, whitehead, the, greatest, philosopher, of, the, 20th, century, deleuze, s, and, latour, s, opinions, however, are, minority, ones, as, whitehead, has, not, been, recognized, as, particularly, influential, within, the, most, dominant, philosophical, schools, it, is, impossible, to, say, exactly, why, whitehead, s, influence, has, not, been, more, widespread, but, it, may, be, partly, due, to, his, metaphysical, ideas, seeming, somewhat, counterintuitive, such, as, his, assertion, that, matter, is, an, abstraction, or, his, inclusion, of, theistic, elements, in, his, philosophy, or, the, perception, of, metaphysics, itself, as, pass, or, simply, the, sheer, difficulty, and, density, of, his, prose, historically, whitehead, s, work, has, been, most, influential, in, the, field, of, american, progressive, theology, the, most, important, early, proponent, of, whitehead, s, thought, in, a, theological, context, was, charles, hartshorne, who, spent, a, semester, at, harvard, as, whitehead, s, teaching, assistant, in, 1925, and, is, widely, credited, with, developing, whitehead, s, process, philosophy, into, a, full, blown, process, theology, other, notable, process, theologians, include, john, b, cobb, david, ray, griffin, marjorie, hewitt, suchocki, c, robert, mesle, roland, faber, and, catherine, keller, process, theology, typically, stresses, god, s, relational, nature, rather, than, seeing, god, as, impassive, or, emotionless, process, theologians, view, god, as, the, fellow, sufferer, who, understands, and, as, the, being, who, is, supremely, affected, by, temporal, events, hartshorne, points, out, that, people, would, not, praise, a, human, ruler, who, was, unaffected, by, either, the, joys, or, sorrows, of, his, followers, so, why, would, this, be, a, praiseworthy, quality, in, god, instead, as, the, being, who, is, most, affected, by, the, world, god, is, the, being, who, can, most, appropriately, respond, to, the, world, however, process, theology, has, been, formulated, in, a, wide, variety, of, ways, c, robert, mesle, for, instance, advocates, a, process, naturalism, i, e, a, process, theology, without, god, in, fact, process, theology, is, difficult, to, define, because, process, theologians, are, so, diverse, and, transdisciplinary, in, their, views, and, interests, john, b, cobb, is, a, process, theologian, who, has, also, written, books, on, biology, and, economics, roland, faber, and, catherine, keller, integrate, whitehead, with, poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and, feminist, theory, charles, birch, was, both, a, theologian, and, a, geneticist, franklin, i, gamwell, writes, on, theology, and, political, theory, in, syntheism, creating, god, in, the, internet, age, futurologists, alexander, bard, and, jan, s, derqvist, repeatedly, credit, whitehead, for, the, process, theology, they, see, rising, out, of, the, participatory, culture, expected, to, dominate, the, digital, era, process, philosophy, is, even, more, difficult, to, pin, down, than, process, theology, in, practice, the, two, fields, cannot, be, neatly, separated, the, 32, volume, state, university, of, new, york, series, in, constructive, postmodern, thought, edited, by, process, philosopher, and, theologian, david, ray, griffin, displays, the, range, of, areas, in, which, different, process, philosophers, work, including, physics, ecology, medicine, public, policy, nonviolence, politics, and, psychology, one, philosophical, school, which, has, historically, had, a, close, relationship, with, process, philosophy, is, american, pragmatism, whitehead, himself, thought, highly, of, william, james, and, john, dewey, and, acknowledged, his, indebtedness, to, them, in, the, preface, to, process, and, reality, charles, hartshorne, along, with, paul, weiss, edited, the, collected, papers, of, charles, sanders, peirce, one, of, the, founders, of, pragmatism, noted, neopragmatist, richard, rorty, was, in, turn, a, student, of, hartshorne, scientists, of, the, early, 20th, century, for, whom, whitehead, s, work, has, been, influential, include, physical, chemist, ilya, prigogine, biologist, conrad, hal, waddington, and, geneticists, charles, birch, and, sewall, wright, henry, murray, dedicated, his, explorations, in, personality, to, whitehead, a, contemporary, at, harvard, in, physics, whitehead, s, theory, of, gravitation, articulated, a, view, that, might, perhaps, be, regarded, as, dual, to, albert, einstein, s, general, relativity, it, has, been, severely, criticized, yutaka, tanaka, suggested, that, the, gravitational, constant, disagrees, with, experimental, findings, and, proposed, that, einstein, s, work, does, not, actually, refute, whitehead, s, formulation, whitehead, s, view, has, now, been, rendered, obsolete, with, the, discovery, of, gravitational, waves, phenomena, observed, locally, that, largely, violate, the, kind, of, local, flatness, of, space, that, whitehead, assumes, consequently, whitehead, s, cosmology, must, be, regarded, as, a, local, approximation, and, his, assumption, of, a, uniform, spatio, temporal, geometry, minkowskian, in, particular, as, an, often, locally, adequate, approximation, an, exact, replacement, of, whitehead, s, cosmology, would, need, to, admit, a, riemannian, geometry, also, although, whitehead, himself, gave, only, secondary, consideration, to, quantum, theory, his, metaphysics, of, processes, has, proved, attractive, to, some, physicists, in, that, field, henry, stapp, and, david, bohm, are, among, those, whose, work, has, been, influenced, by, whitehead, in, the, 21st, century, whiteheadian, thought, is, still, a, stimulating, influence, timothy, e, eastman, and, hank, keeton, s, physics, and, whitehead, 2004, and, michael, epperson, s, quantum, mechanics, and, the, philosophy, of, alfred, north, whitehead, 2004, and, foundations, of, relational, realism, a, topological, approach, to, quantum, mechanics, and, the, philosophy, of, nature, 2013, aim, to, offer, whiteheadian, approaches, to, physics, brian, g, henning, adam, scarfe, and, dorion, sagan, s, beyond, mechanism, 2013, and, rupert, sheldrake, s, science, set, free, 2012, are, examples, of, whiteheadian, approaches, to, biology, one, of, the, most, promising, applications, of, whitehead, s, thought, in, recent, years, has, been, in, the, area, of, ecological, civilization, sustainability, and, environmental, ethics, because, whitehead, s, holistic, metaphysics, of, value, lends, itself, so, readily, to, an, ecological, point, of, view, many, see, his, work, as, a, promising, alternative, to, the, traditional, mechanistic, worldview, providing, a, detailed, metaphysical, picture, of, a, world, constituted, by, a, web, of, interdependent, relations, this, work, has, been, pioneered, by, john, b, cobb, whose, book, is, it, too, late, a, theology, of, ecology, 1971, was, the, first, single, authored, book, in, environmental, ethics, cobb, also, co, authored, a, book, with, leading, ecological, economist, and, steady, state, theorist, herman, daly, entitled, for, the, common, good, redirecting, the, economy, toward, community, the, environment, and, a, sustainable, future, 1989, which, applied, whitehead, s, thought, to, economics, and, received, the, grawemeyer, award, for, ideas, improving, world, order, cobb, followed, this, with, a, second, book, sustaining, the, common, good, a, christian, perspective, on, the, global, economy, 1994, which, aimed, to, challenge, economists, zealous, faith, in, the, great, god, of, growth, whitehead, is, widely, known, for, his, influence, in, education, theory, his, philosophy, inspired, the, formation, of, the, association, for, process, philosophy, of, education, appe, which, published, eleven, volumes, of, a, journal, titled, process, papers, on, process, philosophy, and, education, from, 1996, to, 2008, whitehead, s, theories, on, education, also, led, to, the, formation, of, new, modes, of, learning, and, new, models, of, teaching, one, such, model, is, the, anisa, model, developed, by, daniel, c, jordan, which, sought, to, address, a, lack, of, understanding, of, the, nature, of, people, in, current, education, systems, as, jordan, and, raymond, p, shepard, put, it, because, it, has, not, defined, the, nature, of, man, education, is, in, the, untenable, position, of, having, to, devote, its, energies, to, the, development, of, curricula, without, any, coherent, ideas, about, the, nature, of, the, creature, for, whom, they, are, intended, another, model, is, the, feels, model, developed, by, xie, bangxiu, and, deployed, successfully, in, china, feels, stands, for, five, things, in, curriculum, and, education, flexible, goals, engaged, learner, embodied, knowledge, learning, through, interactions, and, supportive, teacher, it, is, used, for, understanding, and, evaluating, educational, curriculum, under, the, assumption, that, the, purpose, of, education, is, to, help, a, person, become, whole, this, work, is, in, part, the, product, of, cooperation, between, chinese, government, organizations, and, the, institute, for, the, postmodern, development, of, china, whitehead, s, philosophy, of, education, has, also, found, institutional, support, in, canada, where, the, university, of, saskatchewan, created, a, process, philosophy, research, unit, and, sponsored, several, conferences, on, process, philosophy, and, education, howard, woodhouse, at, the, university, of, saskatchewan, remains, a, strong, proponent, of, whiteheadian, education, three, recent, books, which, further, develop, whitehead, s, philosophy, of, education, include, modes, of, learning, whitehead, s, metaphysics, and, the, stages, of, education, 2012, by, george, allan, the, adventure, of, education, process, philosophers, on, learning, teaching, and, research, 2009, by, adam, scarfe, and, educating, for, an, ecological, civilization, interdisciplinary, experiential, and, relational, learning, 2017, edited, by, marcus, ford, and, stephen, rowe, beyond, the, modern, university, toward, a, constructive, postmodern, university, 2002, is, another, text, that, explores, the, importance, of, whitehead, s, metaphysics, for, thinking, about, higher, education, whitehead, has, had, some, influence, on, philosophy, of, business, administration, and, organizational, theory, this, has, led, in, part, to, a, focus, on, identifying, and, investigating, the, effect, of, temporal, events, as, opposed, to, static, things, within, organizations, through, an, organization, studies, discourse, that, accommodates, a, variety, of, weak, and, strong, process, perspectives, from, a, number, of, philosophers, one, of, the, leading, figures, having, an, explicitly, whiteheadian, and, panexperientialist, stance, towards, management, is, mark, dibben, who, works, in, what, he, calls, applied, process, thought, to, articulate, a, philosophy, of, management, and, business, administration, as, part, of, a, wider, examination, of, the, social, sciences, through, the, lens, of, process, metaphysics, for, dibben, this, allows, a, comprehensive, exploration, of, life, as, perpetually, active, experiencing, as, opposed, to, occasional, and, thoroughly, passive, happening, dibben, has, published, two, books, on, applied, process, thought, applied, process, thought, i, initial, explorations, in, theory, and, research, 2008, and, applied, process, thought, ii, following, a, trail, ablaze, 2009, as, well, as, other, papers, in, this, vein, in, the, fields, of, philosophy, of, management, and, business, ethics, margaret, stout, and, carrie, m, staton, have, also, written, recently, on, the, mutual, influence, of, whitehead, and, mary, parker, follett, a, pioneer, in, the, fields, of, organizational, theory, and, organizational, behavior, stout, and, staton, see, both, whitehead, and, follett, as, sharing, an, ontology, that, understands, becoming, as, a, relational, process, difference, as, being, related, yet, unique, and, the, purpose, of, becoming, as, harmonizing, difference, this, connection, is, further, analyzed, by, stout, and, jeannine, m, love, in, integrative, process, follettian, thinking, from, ontology, to, administration, whitehead, s, political, views, sometimes, appear, to, be, libertarian, without, the, label, he, wrote, now, the, intercourse, between, individuals, and, between, social, groups, takes, one, of, two, forms, force, or, persuasion, commerce, is, the, great, example, of, intercourse, by, way, of, persuasion, war, slavery, and, governmental, compulsion, exemplify, the, reign, of, force, on, the, other, hand, many, whitehead, scholars, read, his, work, as, providing, a, philosophical, foundation, for, the, social, liberalism, of, the, new, liberal, movement, that, was, prominent, throughout, whitehead, s, adult, life, morris, wrote, that, there, is, good, reason, for, claiming, that, whitehead, shared, the, social, and, political, ideals, of, the, new, liberals, however, whitehead, s, comment, addresses, means, and, methods, not, ideals, or, pretexts, or, excuses, books, written, by, whitehead, listed, by, date, of, publication, in, addition, the, whitehead, research, project, of, the, center, for, process, studies, is, currently, working, on, a, critical, edition, of, whitehead, s, writings, which, is, set, to, include, notes, taken, by, whitehead, s, students, during, his, harvard, classes, correspondence, and, corrected, editions, of, his, books, for, the, most, comprehensive, list, of, resources, related, to, whitehead, see, the, thematic, bibliography, of, the, center, for, process,
