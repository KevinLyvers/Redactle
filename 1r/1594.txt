claudius, ptolemy, t, l, m, i, greek, ptolemaios, latin, claudius, ptolemaeus, c, 100, c, 170, ad, was, an, alexandrian, mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and, music, theorist, who, wrote, about, a, dozen, scientific, treatises, three, of, which, were, important, to, later, byzantine, islamic, and, western, european, science, the, first, was, his, astronomical, treatise, now, known, as, the, almagest, originally, entitled, mathematical, treatise, greek, math, matik, syntaxis, the, second, is, the, geography, which, is, a, thorough, discussion, on, maps, and, the, geographic, knowledge, of, the, greco, roman, world, the, third, is, the, astrological, treatise, in, which, he, attempted, to, adapt, horoscopic, astrology, to, the, aristotelian, natural, philosophy, of, his, day, this, is, sometimes, known, as, the, apotelesmatika, greek, lit, on, the, effects, but, more, commonly, known, as, the, tetr, biblos, from, the, koine, greek, meaning, four, books, or, by, its, latin, equivalent, quadripartite, the, catholic, church, promoted, his, work, which, included, the, only, mathematically, sound, geocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, and, unlike, most, greek, mathematicians, ptolemy, s, writings, foremost, the, almagest, never, ceased, to, be, copied, or, commented, upon, both, in, late, antiquity, and, in, the, middle, ages, however, it, is, likely, that, only, a, few, truly, mastered, the, mathematics, necessary, to, understand, his, works, as, evidenced, particularly, by, the, many, abridged, and, watered, down, introductions, to, ptolemy, s, astronomy, that, were, popular, among, the, arabs, and, byzantines, his, work, on, epicycles, has, come, to, symbolize, a, very, complex, theoretical, model, built, in, order, to, explain, a, false, assumption, ptolemy, s, date, of, birth, and, birthplace, are, both, unknown, the, 14th, century, astronomer, theodore, meliteniotes, wrote, that, ptolemy, s, birthplace, was, ptolemais, hermiou, a, greek, city, in, the, thebaid, region, of, egypt, now, el, mansha, sohag, governorate, this, attestation, is, quite, late, however, and, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, it, it, is, known, that, ptolemy, lived, in, or, around, the, city, of, alexandria, in, the, roman, province, of, egypt, under, roman, rule, he, had, a, latin, name, claudius, which, is, generally, taken, to, imply, he, was, a, roman, citizen, he, was, familiar, with, greek, philosophers, and, used, babylonian, observations, and, babylonian, lunar, theory, in, half, of, his, extant, works, ptolemy, addresses, a, certain, syrus, a, figure, of, whom, almost, nothing, is, known, but, who, likely, shared, some, of, ptolemy, s, astronomical, interests, ptolemy, died, in, alexandria, c, 168, p311, ptolemy, s, greek, name, ptolemaeus, ptolema, os, is, an, ancient, greek, personal, name, it, occurs, once, in, greek, mythology, and, is, of, homeric, form, it, was, common, among, the, macedonian, upper, class, at, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, and, there, were, several, of, this, name, among, alexander, s, army, one, of, whom, made, himself, pharaoh, in, 323, bc, ptolemy, i, soter, the, first, pharaoh, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, almost, all, subsequent, pharaohs, of, egypt, with, a, few, exceptions, were, named, ptolemies, until, egypt, became, a, roman, province, in, 30, bc, ending, the, macedonian, family, s, rule, the, name, claudius, is, a, roman, name, belonging, to, the, gens, claudia, the, peculiar, multipart, form, of, the, whole, name, claudius, ptolemaeus, is, a, roman, custom, characteristic, of, roman, citizens, this, indicates, that, ptolemy, would, have, been, a, roman, citizen, gerald, toomer, the, translator, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, into, english, suggests, that, citizenship, was, probably, granted, to, one, of, ptolemy, s, ancestors, by, either, the, emperor, claudius, or, the, emperor, nero, the, 9th, century, persian, astronomer, abu, ma, shar, al, balkhi, mistakenly, presents, ptolemy, as, a, member, of, ptolemaic, egypt, s, royal, lineage, stating, that, the, descendants, of, the, alexandrine, general, and, pharaoh, ptolemy, i, soter, were, wise, and, included, ptolemy, the, wise, who, composed, the, book, of, the, almagest, abu, ma, shar, recorded, a, belief, that, a, different, member, of, this, royal, line, composed, the, book, on, astrology, and, attributed, it, to, ptolemy, historical, confusion, on, this, point, can, be, inferred, from, abu, ma, shar, s, subsequent, remark, it, is, sometimes, said, that, the, very, learned, man, who, wrote, the, book, of, astrology, also, wrote, the, book, of, the, almagest, the, correct, answer, is, not, known, not, much, positive, evidence, is, known, on, the, subject, of, ptolemy, s, ancestry, apart, from, what, can, be, drawn, from, the, details, of, his, name, although, modern, scholars, have, concluded, that, abu, ma, shar, s, account, is, erroneous, it, is, no, longer, doubted, that, the, astronomer, who, wrote, the, almagest, also, wrote, the, tetrabiblos, as, its, astrological, counterpart, p, x, in, later, arabic, sources, he, was, often, known, as, the, upper, egyptian, p, 606, suggesting, he, may, have, had, origins, in, southern, egypt, pp, 602, 606, arabic, astronomers, geographers, and, physicists, referred, to, his, name, in, arabic, as, ba, lumyus, arabic, ptolemy, wrote, in, koine, greek, and, can, be, shown, to, have, used, babylonian, astronomical, data, p, 99, he, might, have, been, a, roman, citizen, but, was, ethnically, either, a, greek, or, at, least, a, hellenized, egyptian, astronomy, was, the, subject, to, which, ptolemy, devoted, the, most, time, and, effort, about, half, of, all, the, works, that, survived, deal, with, astronomical, matters, and, even, others, such, as, the, geography, and, the, tetrabiblos, have, significant, references, to, astronomy, ptolemy, s, math, matik, syntaxis, greek, lit, mathematical, systematic, treatise, better, known, as, the, almagest, is, the, only, surviving, comprehensive, ancient, treatise, on, astronomy, although, babylonian, astronomers, had, developed, arithmetical, techniques, for, calculating, and, predicting, astronomical, phenomena, these, were, not, based, on, any, underlying, model, of, the, heavens, early, greek, astronomers, on, the, other, hand, provided, qualitative, geometrical, models, to, save, the, appearances, of, celestial, phenomena, without, the, ability, to, make, any, predictions, the, earliest, person, that, attempted, to, merge, these, two, approaches, was, hipparchus, who, produced, geometric, models, that, not, only, reflected, the, arrangement, of, the, planets, and, stars, but, could, be, used, to, calculate, celestial, motions, ptolemy, following, hipparchus, derived, each, of, his, geometrical, models, for, the, sun, moon, and, the, planets, from, selected, astronomical, observations, done, in, the, spanning, of, more, than, 800, years, however, many, astronomers, have, for, centuries, suspected, that, some, of, his, models, parameters, were, adopted, independently, of, observations, ptolemy, presented, his, astronomical, models, alongside, convenient, tables, which, could, be, used, to, compute, the, future, or, past, position, of, the, planets, the, almagest, also, contains, a, star, catalogue, which, is, a, version, of, a, catalogue, created, by, hipparchus, its, list, of, forty, eight, constellations, is, ancestral, to, the, modern, system, of, constellations, but, unlike, the, modern, system, they, did, not, cover, the, whole, sky, only, what, could, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, in, the, northern, hemisphere, for, over, a, thousand, years, the, almagest, was, the, authoritative, text, on, astronomy, across, europe, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, the, almagest, was, preserved, like, many, extant, greek, scientific, works, in, arabic, manuscripts, the, modern, title, is, thought, to, be, an, arabic, corruption, of, the, greek, name, h, megist, syntaxis, lit, the, greatest, treatise, as, the, work, was, presumably, known, in, late, antiquity, because, of, its, reputation, it, was, widely, sought, and, translated, twice, into, latin, in, the, 12th, century, once, in, sicily, and, again, in, spain, ptolemy, s, planetary, models, like, those, of, the, majority, of, his, predecessors, were, geocentric, and, almost, universally, accepted, until, the, reappearance, of, heliocentric, models, during, the, scientific, revolution, under, the, scrutiny, of, modern, scholarship, and, the, cross, checking, of, observations, contained, in, the, almagest, against, figures, produced, through, backwards, extrapolation, various, patterns, of, errors, have, emerged, within, the, work, a, prominent, miscalculation, is, ptolemy, s, use, of, measurements, that, he, claimed, were, taken, at, noon, but, which, systematically, produce, readings, now, shown, to, be, off, by, half, an, hour, as, if, the, observations, were, taken, at, 12, 30pm, the, overall, quality, of, claudius, ptolemy, s, observations, has, been, challenged, by, several, modern, scientists, but, prominently, by, robert, r, newton, in, his, 1977, book, the, crime, of, claudius, ptolemy, which, asserted, that, ptolemy, fabricated, many, of, his, observations, to, fit, his, theories, newton, accused, ptolemy, of, systematically, inventing, data, or, doctoring, the, data, of, earlier, astronomers, and, labelled, him, the, most, successful, fraud, in, the, history, of, science, one, striking, error, noted, by, newton, was, an, autumn, equinox, said, to, have, been, observed, by, ptolemy, and, measured, with, the, greatest, care, at, 2pm, on, 25, september, 132, when, the, equinox, should, have, been, observed, around, 9, 55am, the, day, prior, in, attempting, to, disprove, newton, herbert, lewis, also, found, himself, agreeing, that, ptolemy, was, an, outrageous, fraud, and, that, all, those, result, capable, of, statistical, analysis, point, beyond, question, towards, fraud, and, against, accidental, error, the, charges, laid, by, newton, and, others, have, been, the, subject, of, wide, discussions, and, received, significant, push, back, from, other, scholars, against, the, findings, owen, gingerich, while, agreeing, that, the, almagest, contains, some, remarkably, fishy, numbers, including, in, the, matter, of, the, 30, hour, displaced, equinox, which, he, noted, aligned, perfectly, with, predictions, made, by, hipparchus, 278, years, earlier, rejected, the, qualification, of, fraud, objections, were, also, raised, by, bernard, goldstein, who, questioned, newton, s, findings, and, suggested, that, he, had, misunderstood, the, secondary, literature, while, noting, that, issues, with, the, accuracy, of, ptolemy, s, observations, had, long, been, known, other, authors, have, pointed, out, that, instrument, warping, or, atmospheric, refraction, may, also, explain, some, of, ptolemy, s, observations, at, a, wrong, time, in, 2022, the, first, greek, fragments, of, hipparchus, lost, star, catalog, were, discovered, in, a, palimpsest, and, they, debunked, accusations, made, by, the, french, astronomer, delambre, in, the, early, 1800s, which, were, repeated, by, r, r, newton, specifically, it, proved, hipparchus, was, not, the, sole, source, of, ptolemy, s, catalog, as, they, both, had, claimed, and, proved, that, ptolemy, did, not, simply, copy, hipparchus, measurements, and, adjust, them, to, account, for, precession, of, the, equinoxes, as, they, had, claimed, scientists, analyzing, the, charts, concluded, it, also, confirms, that, ptolemy, s, star, catalogue, was, not, based, solely, on, data, from, hipparchus, catalogue, these, observations, are, consistent, with, the, view, that, ptolemy, composed, his, star, catalogue, by, combining, various, sources, including, hipparchus, catalogue, his, own, observations, and, possibly, those, of, other, authors, the, handy, tables, greek, are, a, set, of, astronomical, tables, together, with, canons, for, their, use, to, facilitate, astronomical, calculations, ptolemy, tabulated, all, the, data, needed, to, compute, the, positions, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, the, rising, and, setting, of, the, stars, and, eclipses, of, the, sun, and, moon, making, it, a, useful, tool, for, astronomers, and, astrologers, the, tables, themselves, are, known, through, theon, of, alexandria, s, version, although, ptolemy, s, handy, tables, do, not, survive, as, such, in, arabic, or, in, latin, they, represent, the, prototype, of, most, arabic, and, latin, astronomical, tables, or, z, jes, additionally, the, introduction, to, the, handy, tables, survived, separately, from, the, tables, themselves, apparently, part, of, a, gathering, of, some, of, ptolemy, s, shorter, writings, under, the, title, arrangement, and, calculation, of, the, handy, tables, the, planetary, hypotheses, greek, lit, hypotheses, of, the, planets, is, a, cosmological, work, probably, one, of, the, last, written, by, ptolemy, in, two, books, dealing, with, the, structure, of, the, universe, and, the, laws, that, govern, celestial, motion, ptolemy, goes, beyond, the, mathematical, models, of, the, almagest, to, present, a, physical, realization, of, the, universe, as, a, set, of, nested, spheres, in, which, he, used, the, epicycles, of, his, planetary, model, to, compute, the, dimensions, of, the, universe, he, estimated, the, sun, was, at, an, average, distance, of, 1, 210, earth, radii, now, known, to, actually, be, 23, 450, radii, while, the, radius, of, the, sphere, of, the, fixed, stars, was, 20, 000, times, the, radius, of, the, earth, the, work, is, also, notable, for, having, descriptions, on, how, to, build, instruments, to, depict, the, planets, and, their, movements, from, a, geocentric, perspective, much, like, an, orrery, would, have, done, for, a, heliocentric, one, presumably, for, didactic, purposes, the, analemma, is, a, short, treatise, where, ptolemy, provides, a, method, for, specifying, the, location, of, the, sun, in, three, pairs, of, locally, oriented, coordinate, arcs, as, a, function, of, the, declination, of, the, sun, the, terrestrial, latitude, and, the, hour, the, key, to, the, approach, is, to, represent, the, solid, configuration, in, a, plane, diagram, that, ptolemy, calls, the, analemma, in, another, work, the, phaseis, risings, of, the, fixed, stars, ptolemy, gave, a, parapegma, a, star, calendar, or, almanac, based, on, the, appearances, and, disappearances, of, stars, over, the, course, of, the, solar, year, the, planisphaerium, greek, lit, flattening, of, the, sphere, contains, 16, propositions, dealing, with, the, projection, of, the, celestial, circles, onto, a, plane, the, text, is, lost, in, greek, except, for, a, fragment, and, survives, in, arabic, and, latin, only, ptolemy, also, erected, an, inscription, in, a, temple, at, canopus, around, 146, 147, ad, known, as, the, canobic, inscription, although, the, inscription, has, not, survived, someone, in, the, sixth, century, transcribed, it, and, manuscript, copies, preserved, it, through, the, middle, ages, it, begins, to, the, saviour, god, claudius, ptolemy, dedicates, the, first, principles, and, models, of, astronomy, following, by, a, catalogue, of, numbers, that, define, a, system, of, celestial, mechanics, governing, the, motions, of, the, sun, moon, planets, and, stars, in, 2023, archaeologists, were, able, to, read, a, manuscript, which, gives, instructions, for, the, construction, of, an, astronomical, tool, called, a, meteoroscope, or, the, text, which, comes, from, an, eighth, century, manuscript, which, also, contains, ptolemy, s, analemma, was, identified, on, the, basis, of, both, its, content, and, linguistic, analysis, as, being, by, ptolemy, ptolemy, s, second, most, well, known, work, is, his, geographike, hyphegesis, greek, lit, guide, to, drawing, the, earth, known, as, the, geography, a, handbook, on, how, to, draw, maps, using, geographical, coordinates, for, parts, of, the, roman, world, known, at, the, time, he, relied, on, previous, work, by, an, earlier, geographer, marinus, of, tyre, as, well, as, on, gazetteers, of, the, roman, and, ancient, persian, empire, he, also, acknowledged, ancient, astronomer, hipparchus, for, having, provided, the, elevation, of, the, north, celestial, pole, for, a, few, cities, although, maps, based, on, scientific, principles, had, been, made, since, the, time, of, eratosthenes, c, 276, c, 195, bc, ptolemy, improved, on, map, projections, the, first, part, of, the, geography, is, a, discussion, of, the, data, and, of, the, methods, he, used, ptolemy, notes, the, supremacy, of, astronomical, data, over, land, measurements, or, travelers, reports, though, he, possessed, these, data, for, only, a, handful, of, places, ptolemy, s, real, innovation, however, occurs, in, the, second, part, of, the, book, where, he, provides, a, catalogue, of, 8, 000, localities, he, collected, from, marinus, and, others, the, biggest, such, database, from, antiquity, about, 6, 300, of, these, places, and, geographic, features, have, assigned, coordinates, so, that, they, can, be, placed, in, a, grid, that, spanned, the, globe, latitude, was, measured, from, the, equator, as, it, is, today, but, ptolemy, preferred, to, express, it, as, climata, the, length, of, the, longest, day, rather, than, degrees, of, arc, the, length, of, the, midsummer, day, increases, from, 12h, to, 24h, as, one, goes, from, the, equator, to, the, polar, circle, one, of, the, places, ptolemy, noted, specific, coordinates, for, was, the, now, lost, stone, tower, which, marked, the, midpoint, on, the, ancient, silk, road, and, which, scholars, have, been, trying, to, locate, ever, since, in, the, third, part, of, the, geography, ptolemy, gives, instructions, on, how, to, create, maps, both, of, the, whole, inhabited, world, oikoumen, and, of, the, roman, provinces, including, the, necessary, topographic, lists, and, captions, for, the, maps, his, oikoumen, spanned, 180, degrees, of, longitude, from, the, blessed, islands, in, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, middle, of, china, and, about, 80, degrees, of, latitude, from, shetland, to, anti, meroe, east, coast, of, africa, ptolemy, was, well, aware, that, he, knew, about, only, a, quarter, of, the, globe, and, an, erroneous, extension, of, china, southward, suggests, his, sources, did, not, reach, all, the, way, to, the, pacific, ocean, it, seems, likely, that, the, topographical, tables, in, the, second, part, of, the, work, books, 2, 7, are, cumulative, texts, which, were, altered, as, new, knowledge, became, available, in, the, centuries, after, ptolemy, this, means, that, information, contained, in, different, parts, of, the, geography, is, likely, to, be, of, different, dates, in, addition, to, containing, many, scribal, errors, however, although, the, regional, and, world, maps, in, surviving, manuscripts, date, from, c, 1300, ad, after, the, text, was, rediscovered, by, maximus, planudes, there, are, some, scholars, who, think, that, such, maps, go, back, to, ptolemy, himself, ptolemy, wrote, an, astrological, treatise, in, four, parts, known, by, the, greek, term, tetrabiblos, lit, four, books, or, by, its, latin, equivalent, quadripartitum, its, original, title, is, unknown, but, may, have, been, a, term, found, in, some, greek, manuscripts, apotelesmatik, bibl, a, roughly, meaning, books, on, the, effects, or, outcomes, or, prognostics, p, x, as, a, source, of, reference, the, tetrabiblos, is, said, to, have, enjoyed, almost, the, authority, of, a, bible, among, the, astrological, writers, of, a, thousand, years, or, more, p, xii, it, was, first, translated, from, arabic, into, latin, by, plato, of, tivoli, tiburtinus, in, 1138, while, he, was, in, spain, much, of, the, content, of, the, tetrabiblos, was, collected, from, earlier, sources, ptolemy, s, achievement, was, to, order, his, material, in, a, systematic, way, showing, how, the, subject, could, in, his, view, be, rationalized, it, is, indeed, presented, as, the, second, part, of, the, study, of, astronomy, of, which, the, almagest, was, the, first, concerned, with, the, influences, of, the, celestial, bodies, in, the, sublunary, sphere, thus, explanations, of, a, sort, are, provided, for, the, astrological, effects, of, the, planets, based, upon, their, combined, effects, of, heating, cooling, moistening, and, drying, ptolemy, dismisses, other, astrological, practices, such, as, considering, the, numerological, significance, of, names, that, he, believed, to, be, without, sound, basis, and, leaves, out, popular, topics, such, as, electional, astrology, interpreting, astrological, charts, to, determine, courses, of, action, and, medical, astrology, for, similar, reasons, the, great, popularity, that, the, tetrabiblos, did, possess, might, be, attributed, to, its, nature, as, an, exposition, of, the, art, of, astrology, and, as, a, compendium, of, astrological, lore, rather, than, as, a, manual, it, speaks, in, general, terms, avoiding, illustrations, and, details, of, practice, a, collection, of, one, hundred, aphorisms, about, astrology, called, the, centiloquium, ascribed, to, ptolemy, was, widely, reproduced, and, commented, on, by, arabic, latin, and, hebrew, scholars, and, often, bound, together, in, medieval, manuscripts, after, the, tetrabiblos, as, a, kind, of, summation, it, is, now, believed, to, be, a, much, later, pseudepigraphical, composition, the, identity, and, date, of, the, actual, author, of, the, work, referred, to, now, as, pseudo, ptolemy, remains, the, subject, of, conjecture, ptolemy, wrote, a, work, entitled, harmonikon, greek, known, as, the, harmonics, on, music, theory, and, the, mathematics, behind, musical, scales, in, three, books, harmonics, begins, with, a, definition, of, harmonic, theory, with, a, long, exposition, on, the, relationship, between, reason, and, sense, perception, in, corroborating, theoretical, assumptions, after, criticizing, the, approaches, of, his, predecessors, ptolemy, argues, for, basing, musical, intervals, on, mathematical, ratios, as, opposed, to, the, ideas, advocated, by, followers, of, aristoxenus, backed, up, by, empirical, observation, in, contrast, to, the, excessively, theoretical, approach, of, the, pythagoreans, ptolemy, introduces, the, harmonic, canon, greek, name, or, monochord, latin, name, which, is, an, experimental, musical, apparatus, that, he, used, to, measure, relative, pitches, and, used, to, describe, to, his, readers, how, to, demonstrate, the, relations, discussed, in, the, following, chapters, for, themselves, after, the, early, exposition, on, to, build, and, use, monochord, to, test, proposed, tuning, systems, ptolemy, proceeds, to, discuss, pythagorean, tuning, and, how, to, demonstrate, that, their, idealized, musical, scale, fails, in, practice, the, pythagoreans, believed, that, the, mathematics, of, music, should, be, based, on, only, the, one, specific, ratio, of, 3, 2, the, perfect, fifth, and, believed, that, tunings, mathematically, exact, to, their, system, would, prove, to, be, melodious, if, only, the, extremely, large, numbers, involved, could, be, calculated, by, hand, to, the, contrary, ptolemy, believed, that, musical, scales, and, tunings, should, in, general, involve, multiple, different, ratios, arranged, to, fit, together, evenly, into, smaller, tetrachords, combinations, of, four, pitch, ratios, which, together, make, a, perfect, fourth, and, octaves, ptolemy, reviewed, standard, and, ancient, disused, musical, tuning, practice, of, his, day, which, he, then, compared, to, his, own, subdivisions, of, the, tetrachord, and, the, octave, which, he, derived, experimentally, using, a, monochord, harmonic, canon, the, volume, ends, with, a, more, speculative, exposition, of, the, relationships, between, harmony, the, soul, psyche, and, the, planets, harmony, of, the, spheres, although, ptolemy, s, harmonics, never, had, the, influence, of, his, almagest, or, geography, it, is, nonetheless, a, well, structured, treatise, and, contains, more, methodological, reflections, than, any, other, of, his, writings, in, particular, it, is, a, nascent, form, of, what, in, the, following, millennium, developed, into, the, scientific, method, with, specific, descriptions, of, the, experimental, apparatus, that, he, built, and, used, to, test, musical, conjectures, and, the, empirical, musical, relations, he, identified, by, testing, pitches, against, each, other, he, was, able, to, accurately, measure, relative, pitches, based, on, the, ratios, of, vibrating, lengths, two, separate, sides, of, the, same, single, string, hence, which, were, assured, to, be, under, equal, tension, eliminating, one, source, of, error, he, analyzed, the, empirically, determined, ratios, of, pleasant, pairs, of, pitches, and, then, synthesised, all, of, them, into, a, coherent, mathematical, description, which, persists, to, the, present, as, just, intonation, the, standard, for, comparison, of, consonance, in, the, many, other, less, than, exact, but, more, facile, compromise, tuning, systems, during, the, renaissance, ptolemy, s, ideas, inspired, kepler, in, his, own, musings, on, the, harmony, of, the, world, harmonice, mundi, appendix, to, book, v, the, optica, koine, greek, known, as, the, optics, is, a, work, that, survives, only, in, a, somewhat, poor, latin, version, which, in, turn, was, translated, from, a, lost, arabic, version, by, eugenius, of, palermo, c, 1154, in, it, ptolemy, writes, about, properties, of, sight, not, light, including, reflection, refraction, and, colour, the, work, is, a, significant, part, of, the, early, history, of, optics, and, influenced, the, more, famous, and, superior, 11th, century, book, of, optics, by, ibn, al, haytham, ptolemy, offered, explanations, for, many, phenomena, concerning, illumination, and, colour, size, shape, movement, and, binocular, vision, he, also, divided, illusions, into, those, caused, by, physical, or, optical, factors, and, those, caused, by, judgmental, factors, he, offered, an, obscure, explanation, of, the, sun, or, moon, illusion, the, enlarged, apparent, size, on, the, horizon, based, on, the, difficulty, of, looking, upwards, the, work, is, divided, into, three, major, sections, the, first, section, book, ii, deals, with, direct, vision, from, first, principles, and, ends, with, a, discussion, of, binocular, vision, the, second, section, books, iii, iv, treats, reflection, in, plane, convex, concave, and, compound, mirrors, the, last, section, book, v, deals, with, refraction, and, includes, the, earliest, surviving, table, of, refraction, from, air, to, water, for, which, the, values, with, the, exception, of, the, 60, angle, of, incidence, show, signs, of, being, obtained, from, an, arithmetic, progression, however, according, to, mark, smith, ptolemy, s, table, was, based, in, part, on, real, experiments, ptolemy, s, theory, of, vision, consisted, of, rays, or, flux, coming, from, the, eye, forming, a, cone, the, vertex, being, within, the, eye, and, the, base, defining, the, visual, field, the, rays, were, sensitive, and, conveyed, information, back, to, the, observer, s, intellect, about, the, distance, and, orientation, of, surfaces, size, and, shape, were, determined, by, the, visual, angle, subtended, at, the, eye, combined, with, perceived, distance, and, orientation, this, was, one, of, the, early, statements, of, size, distance, invariance, as, a, cause, of, perceptual, size, and, shape, constancy, a, view, supported, by, the, stoics, although, mainly, known, for, his, contributions, to, astronomy, and, other, scientific, subjects, ptolemy, also, engaged, in, epistemological, and, psychological, discussions, across, his, corpus, he, wrote, a, short, essay, entitled, on, the, criterion, and, hegemonikon, greek, which, may, have, been, one, of, his, earliest, works, ptolemy, deals, specifically, with, how, humans, obtain, scientific, knowledge, i, e, the, criterion, of, truth, as, well, as, with, the, nature, and, structure, of, the, human, psyche, or, soul, particularly, its, ruling, faculty, i, e, the, hegemonikon, ptolemy, argues, that, to, arrive, at, the, truth, one, should, use, both, reason, and, sense, perception, in, ways, that, complement, each, other, on, the, criterion, is, also, noteworthy, for, being, the, only, one, of, ptolemy, s, works, that, is, devoid, of, mathematics, elsewhere, ptolemy, affirms, the, supremacy, of, mathematical, knowledge, over, other, forms, of, knowledge, like, aristotle, before, him, ptolemy, classifies, mathematics, as, a, type, of, theoretical, philosophy, however, ptolemy, believes, mathematics, to, be, superior, to, theology, or, metaphysics, because, the, latter, are, conjectural, while, only, the, former, can, secure, certain, knowledge, this, view, is, contrary, to, the, platonic, and, aristotelian, traditions, where, theology, or, metaphysics, occupied, the, highest, honour, despite, being, a, minority, position, among, ancient, philosophers, ptolemy, s, views, were, shared, by, other, mathematicians, such, as, hero, of, alexandria, there, are, several, characters, or, items, named, after, ptolemy, including
