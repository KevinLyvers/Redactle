ideologically, separated, from, congress, muslim, leaders, iqbal, had, also, been, disillusioned, with, the, politicians, of, the, muslim, league, owing, to, the, factional, conflict, that, plagued, the, league, in, the, 1920s, discontent, with, factional, leaders, like, shafi, and, fazl, ur, rahman, iqbal, came, to, believe, that, only, jinnah, was, a, political, leader, capable, of, preserving, unity, and, fulfilling, the, league, s, objectives, of, muslim, political, empowerment, building, a, strong, personal, correspondence, with, jinnah, iqbal, was, influential, in, convincing, jinnah, to, end, his, self, imposed, exile, in, london, return, to, india, and, take, charge, of, the, league, iqbal, firmly, believed, that, jinnah, was, the, only, leader, capable, of, drawing, indian, muslims, to, the, league, and, maintaining, party, unity, before, the, british, and, the, congress, i, know, you, are, a, busy, man, but, i, do, hope, you, won, t, mind, my, writing, to, you, often, as, you, are, the, only, muslim, in, india, today, to, whom, the, community, has, the, right, to, look, up, for, safe, guidance, through, the, storm, which, is, coming, to, north, west, india, and, perhaps, to, the, whole, of, india, while, iqbal, espoused, the, idea, of, muslim, majority, provinces, in, 1930, jinnah, would, continue, to, hold, talks, with, the, congress, through, the, decade, and, only, officially, embraced, the, goal, of, pakistan, in, 1940, some, historians, postulate, that, jinnah, always, remained, hopeful, for, an, agreement, with, the, congress, and, never, fully, desired, the, partition, of, india, iqbal, s, close, correspondence, with, jinnah, is, speculated, by, some, historians, as, having, been, responsible, for, jinnah, s, embrace, of, the, idea, of, pakistan, iqbal, elucidated, to, jinnah, his, vision, of, a, separate, muslim, state, in, a, letter, sent, on, 21, june, 1937, a, separate, federation, of, muslim, provinces, reformed, on, the, lines, i, have, suggested, above, is, the, only, course, by, which, we, can, secure, a, peaceful, india, and, save, muslims, from, the, domination, of, non, muslims, why, should, not, the, muslims, of, north, west, india, and, bengal, be, considered, as, nations, entitled, to, self, determination, just, as, other, nations, in, india, and, outside, india, are, iqbal, serving, as, president, of, the, punjab, muslim, league, criticized, jinnah, s, political, actions, including, a, political, agreement, with, punjabi, leader, sikandar, hyat, khan, whom, iqbal, saw, as, a, representative, of, feudal, classes, and, not, committed, to, islam, as, the, core, political, philosophy, nevertheless, iqbal, worked, constantly, to, encourage, muslim, leaders, and, masses, to, support, jinnah, and, the, league, speaking, about, the, political, future, of, muslims, in, india, iqbal, said, there, is, only, one, way, out, muslims, should, strengthen, jinnah, s, hands, they, should, join, the, muslim, league, indian, question, as, is, now, being, solved, can, be, countered, by, our, united, front, against, both, the, hindus, and, the, english, without, it, our, demands, are, not, going, to, be, accepted, people, say, our, demands, smack, of, communalism, this, is, sheer, propaganda, these, demands, relate, to, the, defense, of, our, national, existence, the, united, front, can, be, formed, under, the, leadership, of, the, muslim, league, and, the, muslim, league, can, succeed, only, on, account, of, jinnah, now, none, but, jinnah, is, capable, of, leading, the, muslims, a, famous, debate, was, held, between, iqbal, and, hussain, ahmed, madani, on, the, question, of, nationalism, in, the, late, 1930s, madani, s, position, throughout, was, to, insist, on, the, islamic, legitimacy, of, embracing, a, culturally, plural, secular, democracy, as, the, best, and, the, only, realistic, future, for, india, s, muslims, where, iqbal, insisted, on, a, religiously, defined, homogeneous, muslim, society, madani, and, iqbal, both, appreciated, this, point, and, they, never, advocated, the, creation, of, an, absolute, islamic, state, they, differed, only, in, their, first, step, according, to, madani, the, first, step, was, the, freedom, of, india, for, which, composite, nationalism, was, necessary, according, to, iqbal, the, first, step, was, the, creation, of, a, community, of, muslims, in, the, muslim, majority, land, i, e, a, muslim, india, within, india, iqbal, s, six, english, lectures, were, published, in, lahore, in, 1930, and, then, by, the, oxford, university, press, in, 1934, in, the, book, the, reconstruction, of, religious, thought, in, islam, the, lectures, had, been, delivered, at, madras, hyderabad, and, aligarh, these, lectures, dwell, on, the, role, of, islam, as, a, religion, and, as, a, political, and, legal, philosophy, in, the, modern, age, in, these, lectures, iqbal, firmly, rejects, the, political, attitudes, and, conduct, of, muslim, politicians, whom, he, saw, as, morally, misguided, attached, to, power, and, without, any, standing, with, the, muslim, masses, iqbal, expressed, fears, that, not, only, would, secularism, weaken, the, spiritual, foundations, of, islam, and, muslim, society, but, that, india, s, hindu, majority, population, would, crowd, out, muslim, heritage, culture, and, political, influence, in, his, travels, to, egypt, afghanistan, iran, and, turkey, he, promoted, ideas, of, greater, islamic, political, co, operation, and, unity, calling, for, the, shedding, of, nationalist, differences, he, also, speculated, on, different, political, arrangements, to, guarantee, muslim, political, power, in, a, dialogue, with, dr, b, r, ambedkar, iqbal, expressed, his, desire, to, see, indian, provinces, as, autonomous, units, under, the, direct, control, of, the, british, government, and, with, no, central, indian, government, he, envisaged, autonomous, muslim, regions, in, india, under, a, single, indian, union, he, feared, for, muslims, who, would, suffer, in, many, respects, especially, concerning, their, existentially, separate, entity, as, muslims, iqbal, was, elected, president, of, the, muslim, league, in, 1930, at, its, session, in, allahabad, in, the, united, provinces, as, well, as, for, the, session, in, lahore, in, 1932, in, his, presidential, address, on, 29, december, 1930, he, outlined, a, vision, of, an, independent, state, for, muslim, majority, provinces, in, north, western, india, i, would, like, to, see, the, punjab, north, west, frontier, province, sind, and, baluchistan, amalgamated, into, a, single, state, self, government, within, the, british, empire, or, without, the, british, empire, the, formation, of, a, consolidated, northwest, indian, muslim, state, appears, to, me, to, be, the, final, destiny, of, the, muslims, at, least, of, northwest, india, in, his, speech, iqbal, emphasised, that, unlike, christianity, islam, came, with, legal, concepts, with, civic, significance, with, its, religious, ideals, considered, as, inseparable, from, social, order, therefore, if, it, means, a, displacement, of, the, islamic, principle, of, solidarity, the, construction, of, a, policy, on, national, lines, is, simply, unthinkable, to, a, muslim, iqbal, thus, stressed, not, only, the, need, for, the, political, unity, of, muslim, communities, but, the, undesirability, of, blending, the, muslim, population, into, a, wider, society, not, based, on, islamic, principles, even, as, he, rejected, secularism, and, nationalism, he, would, not, elucidate, or, specify, if, his, ideal, islamic, state, would, be, a, theocracy, and, criticized, the, intellectual, attitudes, of, islamic, scholars, ulema, as, having, reduced, the, law, of, islam, practically, to, the, state, of, immobility, the, latter, part, of, iqbal, s, life, was, concentrated, on, political, activity, he, travelled, across, europe, and, west, asia, to, garner, political, and, financial, support, for, the, league, he, reiterated, the, ideas, of, his, 1932, address, and, during, the, third, round, table, conference, he, opposed, the, congress, and, proposals, for, transfer, of, power, without, considerable, autonomy, for, muslim, provinces, he, would, serve, as, president, of, the, punjab, muslim, league, and, would, deliver, speeches, and, publish, articles, in, an, attempt, to, rally, muslims, across, india, as, a, single, political, entity, iqbal, consistently, criticized, feudal, classes, in, punjab, as, well, as, muslim, politicians, opposed, to, the, league, many, accounts, of, iqbal, s, frustration, toward, congress, leadership, were, also, pivotal, in, providing, a, vision, for, the, two, nation, theory, iqbal, was, the, first, patron, of, tolu, e, islam, a, historical, political, religious, and, cultural, journal, of, the, muslims, of, british, india, for, a, long, time, iqbal, wanted, a, journal,

journal, was, continued, by, ghulam, ahmed, pervez, who, had, contributed, many, articles, in, its, early, editions, iqbal, s, poetic, works, are, written, primarily, in, persian, rather, than, urdu, among, his, 12, 000, verses, of, poetry, about, 7, 000, verses, are, in, persian, in, 1915, he, published, his, first, collection, of, poetry, the, asrar, i, khudi, secrets, of, the, self, in, persian, the, poems, emphasise, the, spirit, and, self, from, a, religious, perspective, many, critics, have, called, this, iqbal, s, finest, poetic, work, in, asrar, i, khudi, iqbal, explains, his, philosophy, of, khudi, or, self, iqbal, s, use, of, the, term, khudi, is, synonymous, with, the, word, rooh, used, in, the, quran, for, a, divine, spark, which, is, present, in, every, human, being, and, was, said, by, iqbal, to, be, present, in, adam, for, which, god, ordered, all, of, the, angels, to, prostrate, in, front, of, adam, iqbal, condemns, self, destruction, for, him, the, aim, of,

is, not, restricted, to, any, specific, segment, of, the, world, community, but, he, is, for, all, humanity, yet, it, should, also, be, born, in, mind, that, while, dedicating, his, eastern, divan, to, goethe, the, cultural, icon, par, excellence, iqbal, s, payam, i, mashriq, constituted, both, a, reply, as, well, as, a, corrective, to, the, western, divan, of, goethe, for, by, stylizing, himself, as, the, representative, of, the, east, iqbal, endeavored, to, talk, on, equal, terms, to, goethe, as, the, representative, of, west, iqbal, s, revolutionary, works, through, his, poetry,
