death, and, the, founder, of, the, kalmar, union, that, joined, the, scandinavian, kingdoms, together, for, over, a, century, she, had, been, queen, consort, of, norway, from, 1363, to, 1380, and, of, sweden, from, 1363, to, 1364, by, marriage, to, haakon, vi, margaret, was, known, as, a, wise, energetic, and, capable, leader, who, governed, with, farsighted, tact, and, caution, earning, the, nickname, semiramis, of, the, north, also, famous, derisively, as, king, breechless, one, of, several, derogatory, nicknames, once, thought, to, have, been, invented, by, her, rival, king, albert, of, sweden, she, was, also, known, by, her, subjects, as, lady, king, which, became, widely, used, in, recognition, of, her, capabilities, knut, gjerset, calls, her, the, first, great, ruling, queen, in, european, history, the, youngest, daughter, of, valdemar, iv, of, denmark, margaret, was, born, at, s, borg, castle, she, was, a, practical, patient, administrator, and, diplomat, albeit, one, of, high, aspirations, and, a, strong, will, who, intended, to, unite, scandinavia, forever, into, one, single, entity, with, the, strength, to, resist, and, compete, against, the, might, of, the, hanseatic, league, in, 1363, aged, ten, margaret, married, haakon, vi, in, 1370, they, had, a, son, olaf, following, the, deaths, of, her, husband, and, son, margaret, was, proclaimed, queen, of, the, scandinavian, kingdoms, she, was, ultimately, succeeded, by, a, grandnephew, eric, of, pomerania, although, eric, came, of, age, in, 1401, margaret, continued, for, the, remaining, 11, years, of, her, life, to, be, sole, ruler, in, all, but, name, her, regency, marked, the, beginning, of, a, dano, norwegian, union, which, was, to, last, for, more, than, four, centuries, some, norwegian, and, swedish, historians, have, criticized, margaret, for, favouring, denmark, and, being, too, autocratic, though, she, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, highly, regarded, in, norway, and, respected, in, denmark, and, sweden, she, was, painted, in, a, negative, light, in, contemporary, religious, chronicles, as, she, had, no, qualms, suppressing, the, church, to, promote, royal, power, margaret, is, known, in, denmark, as, margrethe, i, to, distinguish, her, from, her, descendant, margrethe, ii, margaret, was, born, in, march, 1353, as, the, sixth, and, youngest, child, of, king, valdemar, iv, and, queen, helvig, of, denmark, she, was, born, in, the, prison, of, s, borg, castle, where, her, father, had, already, confined, her, mother, she, was, baptised, in, roskilde, and, in, 1359, at, the, age, of, six, engaged, to, the, 18, year, old, king, haakon, vi, the, youngest, son, of, the, swedish, norwegian, king, magnus, iv, vii, as, part, of, the, marriage, contract, it, is, presumed, that, a, treaty, was, signed, ensuring, magnus, the, assistance, of, king, valdemar, in, a, dispute, with, his, second, son, eric, xii, of, sweden, who, in, 1356, held, dominion, over, southern, sweden, margaret, s, marriage, was, thus, a, part, of, the, nordic, power, struggle, there, was, dissatisfaction, with, this, in, some, circles, and, the, political, activist, bridget, of, sweden, described, the, agreement, in, a, letter, to, the, pope, as, children, playing, with, dolls, the, goal, of, the, marriage, for, king, valdemar, was, regaining, scania, which, since, 1332, had, been, mortgaged, to, sweden, per, contemporary, sources, the, marriage, contract, contained, an, agreement, to, give, helsingborg, castle, back, to, denmark, but, that, was, not, enough, for, valdemar, who, in, june, 1359, took, a, large, army, across, resund, and, soon, occupied, scania, the, attack, was, ostensibly, to, support, magnus, against, erik, but, in, june, 1359, erik, died, as, a, result, the, balance, of, power, changed, and, all, agreements, between, magnus, and, valdemar, were, terminated, including, the, marriage, contract, between, margaret, and, haakon, this, did, not, result, in, the, withdrawal, of, valdemar, from, scania, he, instead, continued, his, conquests, on, the, island, of, gotland, in, the, baltic, sea, visby, which, was, populated, by, germans, was, the, main, town, on, the, island, and, was, the, key, to, domination, of, the, baltic, sea, on, 27, july, 1361, a, battle, was, fought, between, a, well, equipped, danish, army, and, an, array, of, local, gotland, peasants, the, danes, won, the, battle, and, took, visby, while, the, germans, did, not, take, part, king, magnus, and, the, hanseatic, league, could, not, disregard, this, provocation, and, a, trade, embargo, against, denmark, was, immediately, enacted, with, agreement, about, necessary, military, action, at, the, same, time, negotiations, opened, between, king, magnus, and, henry, of, holstein, about, a, marriage, between, haakon, and, the, latter, s, sister, elizabeth, on, 17, december, 1362, a, ship, left, with, elizabeth, bound, for, sweden, a, storm, however, diverted, her, to, the, danish, island, bornholm, where, the, archbishop, of, lund, declared, the, wedding, a, violation, of, church, law, because, haakon, had, already, been, engaged, to, margaret, the, swedish, and, hanseatic, armies, also, ultimately, withdrew, from, their, siege, of, helsingborg, following, this, a, truce, was, concluded, with, the, hanseatic, states, and, king, magnus, abandoning, the, war, meaning, the, marriage, of, the, now, 10, year, old, margaret, and, king, haakon, was, again, relevant, the, wedding, was, held, in, copenhagen, on, 9, april, 1363, the, marriage, of, haakon, and, margaret, was, an, alliance, and, margaret, likely, remained, in, denmark, for, some, time, after, the, wedding, but, ultimately, was, taken, to, akershus, in, oslo, fjord, where, she, was, raised, by, merete, ulvsdatter, merete, ulvsdatter, was, a, distinguished, noblewoman, and, daughter, of, bridget, of, sweden, as, well, as, the, wife, of, knut, algotsson, who, was, one, of, king, magnus, s, faithful, followers, margaret, was, brought, up, with, merete, s, daughter, ingegerd, who, likely, instructed, her, in, matters, of, religion, and, monarchy, merete, s, daughters, ingegerd, and, catherine, became, her, closest, female, friends, with, margaret, later, showing, favoritism, to, ingegerd, who, became, an, abbess, as, well, as, her, monastery, it, is, also, likely, though, that, her, promotion, of, the, bridgettines, was, also, out, of, piety, and, political, interest, to, help, the, process, of, integration, her, academic, studies, were, probably, limited, but, it, is, assumed, that, in, addition, to, reading, and, writing, she, also, was, instructed, in, statecraft, she, displayed, an, early, talent, for, ruling, and, appears, to, have, held, real, power, in, the, years, after, margaret, s, wedding, scandinavia, saw, a, series, of, major, political, upheavals, a, few, months, after, her, wedding, her, only, brother, christopher, duke, of, lolland, died, leaving, her, father, without, an, obvious, male, heir, in, 1364, the, swedish, nobles, deposed, margaret, s, husband, and, father, in, law, from, the, swedish, throne, and, elected, albert, of, mecklenburg, as, king, of, sweden, her, first, act, after, her, father, s, death, in, 1375, was, to, procure, the, election, of, her, infant, son, olaf, as, king, of, denmark, despite, the, claims, of, her, elder, sister, ingeborg, s, husband, duke, henry, iii, of, mecklenburg, and, their, son, albert, margaret, insisted, that, olaf, be, proclaimed, rightful, heir, of, sweden, among, his, other, titles, he, was, too, young, to, rule, in, his, own, right, and, margaret, proved, herself, a, competent, and, shrewd, ruler, in, the, years, that, followed, on, the, death, of, haakon, in, 1380, olaf, succeeded, him, as, king, of, norway, olaf, died, suddenly, in, 1387, aged, 17, and, margaret, who, had, ruled, both, kingdoms, in, his, name, was, chosen, regent, of, norway, and, denmark, in, the, following, year, she, had, already, proven, her, keen, statesmanship, by, recovering, possession, of, schleswig, from, the, holstein, rendsburg, counts, the, counts, had, held, it, for, more, than, a, generation, and, received, it, back, as, a, fief, by, the, compact, of, nyborg, in, 1386, but, under, such, stringent, conditions, that, the, danish, crown, received, all, the, advantages, of, the, arrangement, by, this, compact, the, often, rebellious, jutish, nobility, lost, the, support, they, had, previously, enjoyed, in, schleswig, and, holstein, margaret, free, from, fear, of, domestic, sedition, could, now, give, her, undivided, attention, to, sweden, where, mutinous, nobles, led, by, birger, son, of, bridget, and, brother, of, martha, were, already, in, arms, against, their, unpopular, king, albert, several, of, the, powerful, nobles, wrote, to, margaret, that, if, she, would, help, rid, sweden, of, albert, she, would, become, their, regent, she, quickly, gathered, an, army, and, invaded, sweden, at, a, conference, held, at, dalaborg, castle, in, march, 1388, the, swedes, were, compelled, to, accept, all, of, margaret, s, conditions, elected, her, sovereign, lady, and, ruler, and, committed, themselves, to, accept, any, king, she, chose, to, appoint, albert, who, had, called, her, king, pantsless, returned, from, mecklenburg, with, an, army, of, mercenaries, on, 24, february, 1389, the, decisive, battle, took, place, at, either, aasle, or, falan, near, falk, ping, general, henrik, parow, the, mecklenburger, commander, of, margaret, s, forces, was, killed, in, battle, but, he, managed, to, win, it, for, her, margaret, was, now, the, omnipotent, mistress, of, three, kingdoms, stockholm, then, almost, entirely, a, german, city, still, held, out, fear, of, margaret, induced, both, the, mecklenburg, princes, and, the, wendish, towns, to, hasten, to, its, assistance, and, the, baltic, and, the, north, sea, speedily, swarmed, with, the, privateers, of, the, victual, brothers, the, hanseatic, league, intervened, and, under, the, compact, of, lindholm, 1395, margaret, released, albert, on, his, promise, to, pay, 60, 000, marks, within, three, years, meanwhile, the, hansa, were, to, hold, stockholm, as, surety, albert, failed, to, pay, his, ransom, within, the, stipulated, time, and, the, hansa, surrendered, stockholm, to, margaret, in, september, 1398, in, exchange, for, commercial, privileges, it, had, been, understood, that, margaret, should, at, the, first, convenient, opportunity, provide, the, three, kingdoms, with, a, king, who, was, to, be, a, kinsman, of, all, the, three, old, dynasties, although, in, norway, it, was, specified, that, she, would, continue, ruling, alongside, the, new, king, while, in, sweden, the, nobles, assured, margaret, that, they, were, content, to, do, without, a, king, throughout, her, lifetime, which, they, hoped, would, be, long, in, 1389, she, proclaimed, her, great, nephew, bogislav, who, changed, his, name, to, eric, of, pomerania, grandson, of, henry, of, mecklenburg, king, of, norway, having, adopted, him, and, his, sister, catherine, in, 1396, homage, was, rendered, to, him, in, denmark, and, sweden, while, margaret, once, again, assumed, the, regency, during, his, minority, on, 20, july, margaret, capitalized, on, the, general, rejoicing, by, publishing, the, famous, treaty, of, kalmar, a, masterly, document, that, sealed, the, union, of, norway, sweden, and, denmark, the, date, she, chose, was, no, coincidence, it, was, the, feast, day, of, st, margaret, of, antioch, who, like, the, lady, king, herself, was, cast, off, by, her, father, and, thrown, into, prison, the, treaty, proposed, everlasting, union, which, reflected, her, dearest, ambition, that, all, three, realms, should, exist, together, in, harmony, and, love, and, whatever, befalleth, one, war, and, rumors, of, war, or, the, onslaught, of, foreigners, that, shall, be, for, all, three, and, each, kingdom, shall, help, the, others, in, all, fealty, and, hereafter, the, nordic, realms, shall, have, one, king, and, not, several, well, aware, of, regional, pride, and, prejudice, margaret, played, a, careful, strategy, assuring, her, subjects, that, each, state, would, be, governed, according, to, the, laws, and, customs, of, each, no, new, laws, would, be, introduced, without, the, consent, of, the, subjects, officials, from, governors, to, soldiers, would, be, recruited, from, the, native, populations, thus, showing, her, subjects, that, they, would, enjoy, every, benefit, of, union, without, any, threat, to, national, identity, to, weld, the, united, kingdoms, still, more, closely, together, margaret, summoned, a, congress, of, the, three, councils, of, the, realm, to, kalmar, in, june, 1397, and, on, trinity, sunday, 17, june, eric, was, crowned, king, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, the, act, of, union, resulting, from, this, was, never, completed, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, reasons, but, the, union, existed, de, facto, through, the, early, 16th, century, reign, of, king, christian, ii, and, the, union, of, denmark, and, norway, continued, until, 1814, a, few, years, after, the, kalmar, union, the, 18, year, old, eric, was, declared, of, age, and, homage, was, rendered, to, him, in, all, his, three, kingdoms, although, margaret, was, the, effective, ruler, of, scandinavia, throughout, her, lifetime, so, long, as, the, union, was, insecure, margaret, had, tolerated, the, presence, of, the, riksr, d, but, their, influence, was, minor, and, the, royal, authority, remained, supreme, the, offices, of, high, constable, and, earl, marshal, were, left, vacant, the, danehof, fell, into, ruin, and, the, great, queen, an, ideal, despot, ruled, through, her, court, officials, who, served, as, a, superior, kind, of, clerk, in, any, event, law, and, order, were, well, maintained, and, the, licence, of, the, nobility, was, sternly, repressed, the, kingdoms, of, sweden, and, norway, were, treated, as, integral, parts, of, the, danish, state, and, national, aspirations, were, frowned, upon, or, checked, though, norway, being, more, loyal, was, treated, more, indulgently, than, sweden, in, 1396, according, to, grethe, jacobsen, she, issued, an, ordinance, that, one, should, to, a, higher, degree, than, hitherto, respect, and, enforce, peace, towards, church, pax, dei, houses, farms, legal, assemblies, workers, in, the, fields, and, women, expressed, in, the, word, kvindefred, jacobsen, believes, that, as, punishment, for, rape, was, normally, not, associated, with, the, other, forms, for, upholding, peace, in, the, tradition, of, pax, dei, this, may, be, an, expression, of, margrete, s, perception, of, women, as, being, particularly, vulnerable, in, times, of, unrest, and, for, her, own, interpretation, of, the, ruler, as, protector, of, personae, miserabiles, which, included, maidens, and, widows, another, testament, was, her, dispositions, of, 1411, through, which, she, distributed, the, sum, of, 500, marcs, among, the, women, who, had, been, violated, and, debased, during, the, wars, between, sweden, and, denmark, 1388, 1389, margaret, recovered, for, the, crown, all, the, landed, property, that, had, been, alienated, in, the, troubled, times, before, the, reign, of, valdemar, iv, this, so, called, reduktion, or, land, recovery, was, carried, out, with, the, utmost, rigour, and, hundreds, of, estates, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, crown, she, also, reformed, the, danish, currency, substituting, good, silver, coins, for, the, old, and, worthless, copper, tokens, to, the, great, advantage, both, of, herself, and, of, the, state, she, always, had, large, sums, of, money, at, her, disposal, and, much, of, it, was, given, to, charity, according, to, thomas, kingston, derry, margaret, tried, to, provide, the, union, with, a, sound, economic, basis, in, the, process, each, of, her, measures, recovery, of, crown, lands, from, nobility, and, the, church, new, taxes, and, new, coins, hurt, the, interests, of, powerful, classes, but, she, prevented, them, from, having, leadership, by, making, little, use, of, separate, councils, of, her, three, kingdoms, relying, on, a, body, of, civil, and, ecclesiastical, officials, she, chose, with, great, skills, instead, she, placed, danes, in, swedish, and, norwegian, bishoprics, while, royal, estates, and, castles, were, managed, by, castellans, and, bailiffs, of, foreign, extraction, while, this, has, been, criticized, as, promoting, danes, at, the, expense, of, swedish, and, norwegian, people, derry, opines, that, considering, she, employed, more, germans, in, her, native, denmark, than, elsewhere, she, was, mainly, interested, in, securing, a, loyal, and, efficient, administration, she, travelled, much, in, her, later, years, is, said, to, have, spent, more, time, in, sweden, than, in, denmark, she, encouraged, intermarriages, among, the, nobility, of, three, realms, her, piety, is, well, known, and, she, gave, strong, backing, to, the, canonisation, of, st, brigitta, helped, to, make, vadstena, into, a, strong, cultural, centre, and, encouraged, the, spread, of, brigittine, language, which, led, to, many, swedish, expressions, coming, into, use, among, danes, and, norwegians, in, contrast, with, the, foreign, policy, of, her, venturesome, father, margaret, s, was, circumspect, and, unswervingly, neutral, in, the, bloody, war, between, france, and, england, as, well, as, other, european, conflicts, however, she, spared, no, pains, to, recover, lost, danish, territory, she, purchased, the, island, of, gotland, from, its, actual, possessors, albert, of, mecklenburg, and, the, livonian, order, and, the, greater, part, of, schleswig, was, regained, in, the, same, way, in, 1402, margaret, entered, into, negotiations, with, king, henry, iv, of, england, about, the, possibility, of, a, double, wedding, alliance, between, england, and, the, nordic, union, the, proposal, was, for, king, eric, to, marry, henry, s, daughter, philippa, and, for, henry, s, son, the, prince, of, wales, and, future, henry, v, of, england, to, marry, eric, s, sister, catherine, according, to, marc, shell, margaret, s, vision, was, that, one, day, two, unions, would, unite, to, recreate, cnut, the, great, s, empire, of, the, north, the, english, side, wanted, these, weddings, to, seal, an, offensive, alliance, that, could, have, led, the, nordic, kingdoms, to, become, involved, in, the, hundred, years, war, against, france, margaret, followed, a, consistent, policy, of, not, becoming, involved, in, binding, alliances, and, foreign, wars, and, therefore, rejected, the, english, proposals, however, although, there, was, no, double, wedding, eric, married, the, 13, year, old, philippa, daughter, of, henry, iv, of, england, and, mary, de, bohun, at, lund, on, 26, october, 1406, sealing, a, purely, defensive, alliance, for, eric, s, sister, catherine, a, wedding, was, arranged, with, john, count, palatine, of, neumarkt, margaret, thus, acquired, a, south, german, ally, who, could, be, useful, as, a, counterweight, to, the, north, german, princes, and, cities, in, 1412, margaret, tried, to, recover, schleswig, and, thus, entered, a, war, with, holstein, before, that, she, had, managed, the, recovery, of, finland, and, gotland, while, winning, the, war, margaret, died, suddenly, on, board, her, ship, in, flensburg, harbor, in, october, 1412, she, set, sail, from, seeland, in, her, ship, she, attended, several, debates, which, reportedly, had, brought, matters, to, a, state, of, promising, forwardness, on, retiring, to, her, vessel, though, with, the, intention, of, leaving, the, port, she, was, seized, with, sudden, and, violent, illness, margaret, apparently, foresaw, the, end, of, her, life, as, she, ordered, thirty, seven, marks, to, be, paid, to, the, nearby, monastery, of, campen, for, a, perpetual, mass, for, her, soul, beyond, this, there, is, no, discussion, in, the, historical, record, regarding, her, demise, she, died, on, the, night, of, 28, october, 1412, the, vigil, of, st, simon, and, st, jude, possible, scenarios, that, have, been, suggested, include, plague, shock, from, the, death, of, abraham, brodersson, whom, 18th, century, authors, have, alleged, was, the, father, of, a, daughter, margareta, had, while, 19th, century, authors, have, blamed, the, story, on, a, mistranslation, or, poisoning, by, eric, her, sarcophagus, made, by, the, l, beck, sculptor, johannes, junge, in, 1423, is, situated, behind, the, high, altar, in, the, roskilde, cathedral, near, copenhagen, she, had, left, property, to, the, cathedral, on, the, condition, that, masses, for, her, soul, would, be, said, regularly, in, the, future, this, was, discontinued, in, 1536, during, the, protestant, reformation, though, a, special, bell, is, still, rung, twice, daily, in, commemoration, she, has, been, described, as, a, beautiful, woman, with, dark, hair, dark, eyes, an, intimidating, gaze, and, the, aura, of, absolute, authority, she, was, highly, energetic, well, into, her, old, age, autocratic, and, indomitable, at, the, same, time, also, described, as, wise, just, tactful, and, kind, hudson, strode, writes, margaret, who, like, st, bridget, possessed, the, masculine, quality, of, indomitability, was, undoubtedly, the, strongest, no, male, public, official, ever, worked, harder, at, his, job, she, used, her, constructive, ability, her, diplomacy, and, her, force, of, will, to, make, the, union, a, success, and, to, maintain, the, royal, prerogative, in, denmark, margaret, was, called, sovereign, lady, and, lord, and, guardian, of, the, entire, kingdom, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, later, bestowed, on, her, similar, titles, this, special, double, gendered, title, bestowed, upon, the, holder, the, power, and, authority, of, a, man, lord, of, a, woman, sovereign, lady, and, of, the, gender, neutral, guardian, later, when, erik, was, elected, king, of, norway, in, 1392, she, renounced, this, title, in, norway, and, in, 1396, when, he, was, crowned, as, king, of, denmark, and, sweden, she, stopped, the, use, of, this, title, altogether, although, she, continued, as, regent, she, only, styled, herself, queen, of, denmark, in, 1375, usually, referring, to, herself, as, margaret, by, the, grace, of, god, daughter, of, valdemar, king, of, denmark, and, denmark, s, rightful, heir, when, referring, to, her, position, in, denmark, her, title, in, denmark, was, derived, from, her, father, king, valdemar, iv, of, denmark, others, simply, referred, to, her, as, the, lady, queen, without, specifying, what, she, was, queen, of, but, not, so, pope, boniface, ix, who, in, his, letter, on, 9, september, 1390, styled, her, our, beloved, daughter, in, christ, margaret, most, excellent, queen, of, denmark, sweden, and, norway, carissime, in, christo, filie, margarete, dacie, suecie, et, norwegie, regine, illustri, when, she, married, haakon, vi, of, norway, in, 1363, he, was, co, king, of, sweden, making, margaret, queen, consort, and, despite, being, deposed, they, never, relinquished, the, title, from, 24, february, 1389, to, 28, october, 1412, she, was, queen, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, and, founder, of, the, kalmar, union, which, united, the, scandinavian, countries, for, over, a, century, she, acted, as, queen, regnant, of, denmark, although, in, those, days, it, was, not, the, danish, custom, for, a, woman, to, reign, e, c, otte, writes, in, 1874, that, f, margaret, could, have, been, certain, of, being, followed, on, the, throne, by, rulers, as, able, and, just, as, she, had, been, this, act, of, the, union, of, calmar, might, have, worked, for, the, good, of, the, three, kingdoms, for, it, was, quite, true, as, the, queen, said, that, each, one, alone, was, a, poor, weak, state, open, to, danger, from, every, side, but, that, the, three, united, would, make, a, monarchy, strong, enough, to, defy, the, attacks, and, schemes, of,
