thomas, young, frs, 13, june, 1773, 10, may, 1829, was, a, british, polymath, who, made, notable, contributions, to, the, fields, of, vision, light, solid, mechanics, energy, physiology, language, musical, harmony, and, egyptology, he, was, instrumental, in, the, decipherment, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, specifically, the, rosetta, stone, young, has, been, described, as, the, last, man, who, knew, everything, his, work, influenced, that, of, william, herschel, hermann, von, helmholtz, james, clerk, maxwell, and, albert, einstein, young, is, credited, with, establishing, christiaan, huygens, wave, theory, of, light, in, contrast, to, the, corpuscular, theory, of, isaac, newton, young, s, work, was, subsequently, supported, by, the, work, of, augustin, jean, fresnel, young, belonged, to, a, quaker, family, of, milverton, somerset, where, he, was, born, in, 1773, the, eldest, of, ten, children, by, the, age, of, fourteen, young, had, learned, greek, latin, french, italian, syriac, samaritan, hebrew, arabic, biblical, aramaic, persian, turkish, and, ge, ez, young, began, to, study, medicine, in, london, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, in, 1792, moved, to, the, university, of, edinburgh, medical, school, in, 1794, and, a, year, later, went, to, g, ttingen, lower, saxony, germany, where, he, obtained, the, degree, of, doctor, of, medicine, in, 1796, from, the, university, of, g, ttingen, in, 1797, he, entered, emmanuel, college, cambridge, in, the, same, year, he, inherited, the, estate, of, his, grand, uncle, richard, brocklesby, which, made, him, financially, independent, and, in, 1799, he, established, himself, as, a, physician, at, 48, welbeck, street, london, now, recorded, with, a, blue, plaque, young, published, many, of, his, first, academic, articles, anonymously, to, protect, his, reputation, as, a, physician, in, 1801, young, was, appointed, professor, of, natural, philosophy, mainly, physics, at, the, royal, institution, in, two, years, he, delivered, 91, lectures, in, 1802, he, was, appointed, foreign, secretary, of, the, royal, society, of, which, he, had, been, elected, a, fellow, in, 1794, he, resigned, his, professorship, in, 1803, fearing, that, its, duties, would, interfere, with, his, medical, practice, his, lectures, were, published, in, 1807, in, the, course, of, lectures, on, natural, philosophy, and, contain, a, number, of, anticipations, of, later, theories, in, 1811, young, became, physician, to, st, george, s, hospital, and, in, 1814, he, served, on, a, committee, appointed, to, consider, the, dangers, involved, in, the, general, introduction, of, gas, for, lighting, into, london, in, 1816, he, was, secretary, of, a, commission, charged, with, ascertaining, the, precise, length, of, the, seconds, pendulum, the, length, of, a, pendulum, whose, period, is, exactly, 2, seconds, and, in, 1818, he, became, secretary, to, the, board, of, longitude, and, superintendent, of, the, hm, nautical, almanac, office, young, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1822, a, few, years, before, his, death, he, became, interested, in, life, insurance, and, in, 1827, he, was, chosen, as, one, of, the, eight, foreign, associates, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, the, same, year, he, became, a, first, class, corresponding, member, living, abroad, of, the, royal, institute, of, the, netherlands, in, 1828, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1804, young, married, eliza, maxwell, they, had, no, children, young, died, in, his, 56th, year, in, london, on, 10, may, 1829, having, suffered, recurrent, attacks, of, asthma, his, autopsy, revealed, atherosclerosis, of, the, aorta, his, body, was, buried, in, the, graveyard, of, st, giles, church, at, farnborough, in, the, county, of, kent, westminster, abbey, houses, a, white, marble, tablet, in, memory, of, young, bearing, an, epitaph, by, hudson, gurney, sacred, to, the, memory, of, thomas, young, m, d, fellow, and, foreign, secretary, of, the, royal, society, member, of, the, national, institute, of, france, a, man, alike, eminent, in, almost, every, department, of, human, learning, patient, of, unintermitted, labour, endowed, with, the, faculty, of, intuitive, perception, who, bringing, an, equal, mastery, to, the, most, abstruse, investigations, of, letters, and, of, science, first, established, the, undulatory, theory, of, light, and, first, penetrated, the, obscurity, which, had, veiled, for, ages, the, hieroglyphs, of, egypt, endeared, to, his, friends, by, his, domestic, virtues, honoured, by, the, world, for, his, unrivalled, acquirements, he, died, in, the, hopes, of, the, resurrection, of, the, just, born, at, milverton, in, somersetshire, 13, june, 1773, died, in, park, square, london, 10, may, 1829, in, the, 56th, year, of, his, age, young, was, highly, regarded, by, his, friends, and, colleagues, he, was, said, never, to, impose, his, knowledge, but, if, asked, was, able, to, answer, even, the, most, difficult, scientific, question, with, ease, although, very, learned, he, had, a, reputation, for, sometimes, having, difficulty, in, communicating, his, knowledge, it, was, said, by, one, of, his, contemporaries, that, his, words, were, not, those, in, familiar, use, and, the, arrangement, of, his, ideas, seldom, the, same, as, those, he, conversed, with, he, was, therefore, worse, calculated, than, any, man, i, ever, knew, for, the, communication, of, knowledge, though, he, sometimes, dealt, with, religious, topics, of, history, in, egypt, and, wrote, about, the, history, of, christianity, in, nubia, not, much, is, known, about, young, s, personal, religious, views, on, george, peacock, s, account, young, never, spoke, to, him, about, morals, metaphysics, or, religion, though, according, to, young, s, wife, his, attitudes, showed, that, his, quaker, upbringing, had, strongly, influenced, his, religious, practices, authoritative, sources, have, described, young, in, terms, of, a, cultural, christian, quaker, hudson, gurney, informed, that, before, his, marriage, young, had, to, join, the, church, of, england, and, was, baptized, later, gurney, stated, that, young, retained, a, good, deal, of, his, old, creed, and, carried, to, his, scriptural, studies, his, habit, of, inquisition, of, languages, and, manners, rather, than, the, habit, of, proselytism, yet, the, day, before, his, death, young, participated, in, religious, sacraments, as, reported, in, david, brewster, s, edinburgh, journal, of, science, after, some, information, concerning, his, affairs, and, some, instructions, concerning, the, hierographical, papers, in, his, hands, he, said, that, perfectly, aware, of, his, situation, he, had, taken, the, sacraments, of, the, church, on, the, day, preceding, his, religious, sentiments, were, by, himself, stated, to, be, liberal, though, orthodox, he, had, extensively, studied, the, scriptures, of, which, the, precepts, were, deeply, impressed, upon, his, mind, from, his, earliest, years, and, he, evidenced, the, faith, which, he, professed, in, an, unbending, course, of, usefulness, and, rectitude, in, young, s, own, judgment, of, his, many, achievements, the, most, important, was, to, establish, the, wave, theory, of, light, set, out, by, christiaan, huygens, in, his, treatise, on, light, 1690, to, do, so, he, had, to, overcome, the, century, old, view, expressed, in, the, venerable, newton, s, opticks, that, light, is, a, particle, nevertheless, in, the, early, 19th, century, young, put, forth, a, number, of, theoretical, reasons, supporting, the, wave, theory, of, light, and, he, developed, two, enduring, demonstrations, to, support, this, viewpoint, with, the, ripple, tank, he, demonstrated, the, idea, of, interference, in, the, context, of, water, waves, with, young, s, interference, experiment, the, predecessor, of, the, double, slit, experiment, he, demonstrated, interference, in, the, context, of, light, as, a, wave, young, speaking, on, 24, november, 1803, to, the, royal, society, of, london, began, his, now, classic, description, of, the, historic, experiment, the, experiments, i, am, about, to, relate, may, be, repeated, with, great, ease, whenever, the, sun, shines, and, without, any, other, apparatus, than, is, at, hand, to, every, one, in, his, subsequent, paper, titled, experiments, and, calculations, relative, to, physical, optics, 1804, young, describes, an, experiment, in, which, he, placed, a, card, measuring, approximately, 0, 85, millimetres, 0, 033, in, in, a, beam, of, light, from, a, single, opening, in, a, window, and, observed, the, fringes, of, colour, in, the, shadow, and, to, the, sides, of, the, card, he, observed, that, placing, another, card, in, front, or, behind, the, narrow, strip, so, as, to, prevent, the, light, beam, from, striking, one, of, its, edges, caused, the, fringes, to, disappear, this, supported, the, contention, that, light, is, composed, of, waves, young, performed, and, analysed, a, number, of, experiments, including, interference, of, light, from, reflection, off, nearby, pairs, of, micrometre, grooves, from, reflection, off, thin, films, of, soap, and, oil, and, from, newton, s, rings, he, also, performed, two, important, diffraction, experiments, using, fibres, and, long, narrow, strips, in, his, course, of, lectures, on, natural, philosophy, and, the, mechanical, arts, 1807, he, gives, grimaldi, credit, for, first, observing, the, fringes, in, the, shadow, of, an, object, placed, in, a, beam, of, light, within, ten, years, much, of, young, s, work, was, reproduced, and, then, extended, by, augustin, jean, fresnel, young, described, the, characterization, of, elasticity, that, came, to, be, known, as, young, s, modulus, denoted, as, e, in, 1807, and, further, described, it, in, his, course, of, lectures, on, natural, philosophy, and, the, mechanical, arts, however, the, first, use, of, the, concept, of, young, s, modulus, in, experiments, was, by, giordano, riccati, in, 1782, predating, young, by, 25, years, furthermore, the, idea, can, be, traced, to, a, paper, by, leonhard, euler, published, in, 1727, some, 80, years, before, thomas, young, s, 1807, paper, the, young, s, modulus, relates, the, stress, pressure, in, a, body, to, its, associated, strain, change, in, length, as, a, ratio, of, the, original, length, that, is, stress, e, strain, for, a, uniaxially, loaded, specimen, young, s, modulus, is, independent, of, the, component, under, investigation, that, is, it, is, an, inherent, material, property, the, term, modulus, refers, to, an, inherent, material, property, young, s, modulus, allowed, for, the, first, time, prediction, of, the, strain, in, a, component, subject, to, a, known, stress, and, vice, versa, prior, to, young, s, contribution, engineers, were, required, to, apply, hooke, s, f, kx, relationship, to, identify, the, deformation, x, of, a, body, subject, to, a, known, load, f, where, the, constant, k, is, a, function, of, both, the, geometry, and, material, under, consideration, finding, k, required, physical, testing, for, any, new, component, as, the, f, kx, relationship, is, a, function, of, both, geometry, and, material, young, s, modulus, depends, only, on, the, material, not, its, geometry, thus, allowing, a, revolution, in, engineering, strategies, young, s, problems, in, sometimes, not, expressing, himself, clearly, were, shown, by, his, own, definition, of, the, modulus, the, modulus, of, the, elasticity, of, any, substance, is, a, column, of, the, same, substance, capable, of, producing, a, pressure, on, its, base, which, is, to, the, weight, causing, a, certain, degree, of, compression, as, the, length, of, the, substance, is, to, the, diminution, of, its, length, when, this, explanation, was, put, to, the, lords, of, the, admiralty, their, clerk, wrote, to, young, saying, though, science, is, much, respected, by, their, lordships, and, your, paper, is, much, esteemed, it, is, too, learned, in, short, it, is, not, understood, young, has, also, been, called, the, founder, of, physiological, optics, in, 1793, he, explained, the, mode, in, which, the, eye, accommodates, itself, to, vision, at, different, distances, as, depending, on, change, of, the, curvature, of, the, crystalline, lens, in, 1801, he, was, the, first, to, describe, astigmatism, and, in, his, lectures, he, presented, the, hypothesis, afterwards, developed, by, hermann, von, helmholtz, the, young, helmholtz, theory, that, colour, perception, depends, on, the, presence, in, the, retina, of, three, kinds, of, nerve, fibres, this, foreshadowed, the, modern, understanding, of, colour, vision, in, particular, the, finding, that, the, eye, does, indeed, have, three, colour, receptors, which, are, sensitive, to, different, wavelength, ranges, in, 1804, young, developed, the, theory, of, capillary, phenomena, on, the, principle, of, surface, tension, he, also, observed, the, constancy, of, the, angle, of, contact, of, a, liquid, surface, with, a, solid, and, showed, how, from, these, two, principles, to, deduce, the, phenomena, of, capillary, action, in, 1805, pierre, simon, laplace, the, french, philosopher, discovered, the, significance, of, meniscus, radii, with, respect, to, capillary, action, in, 1830, carl, friedrich, gauss, the, german, mathematician, unified, the, work, of, these, two, scientists, to, derive, the, young, laplace, equation, the, formula, that, describes, the, capillary, pressure, difference, sustained, across, the, interface, between, two, static, fluids, young, was, the, first, to, define, the, term, energy, in, the, modern, sense, he, also, did, work, on, the, theory, of, tides, paralleling, that, of, laplace, and, anticipating, more, well, known, work, by, airy, young, s, equation, describes, the, contact, angle, of, a, liquid, drop, on, a, plane, solid, surface, as, a, function, of, the, surface, free, energy, the, interfacial, free, energy, and, the, surface, tension, of, the, liquid, young, s, equation, was, developed, further, some, 60, years, later, by, dupr, to, account, for, thermodynamic, effects, and, this, is, known, as, the, young, dupr, equation, in, physiology, young, made, an, important, contribution, to, haemodynamics, in, the, croonian, lecture, for, 1808, on, the, functions, of, the, heart, and, arteries, where, he, derived, a, formula, for, the, wave, speed, of, the, pulse, and, his, medical, writings, included, an, introduction, to, medical, literature, including, a, system, of, practical, nosology, 1813, and, a, practical, and, historical, treatise, on, consumptive, diseases, 1815, young, devised, a, rule, of, thumb, for, determining, a, child, s, drug, dosage, young, s, rule, states, that, the, child, dosage, is, equal, to, the, adult, dosage, multiplied, by, the, child, s, age, in, years, divided, by, the, sum, of, 12, plus, the, child, s, age, in, an, appendix, to, his, 1796, g, ttingen, dissertation, de, corporis, hvmani, viribvs, conservatricibvs, there, are, four, pages, added, proposing, a, universal, phonetic, alphabet, so, as, not, to, leave, these, pages, blank, lit, ne, vacuae, starent, hae, paginae, libuit, e, praelectione, ante, disputationem, habenda, tabellam, literarum, vniuersalem, raptim, describere, it, includes, 16, pure, vowel, symbols, nasal, vowels, various, consonants, and, examples, of, these, drawn, primarily, from, french, and, english, in, his, encyclop, dia, britannica, article, languages, young, compared, the, grammar, and, vocabulary, of, 400, languages, in, a, separate, work, in, 1813, he, introduced, the, term, indo, european, languages, 165, years, after, the, dutch, linguist, and, scholar, marcus, zuerius, van, boxhorn, proposed, the, grouping, to, which, this, term, refers, in, 1647, young, made, significant, contributions, to, the, decipherment, of, ancient, egyptian, writing, systems, he, started, his, egyptology, work, rather, late, in, 1813, when, the, work, was, already, in, progress, among, other, researchers, he, began, by, using, an, egyptian, demotic, alphabet, of, 29, letters, built, up, by, johan, david, kerblad, in, 1802, 14, turned, out, to, be, incorrect, kerblad, was, correct, in, stressing, the, importance, of, the, demotic, text, in, trying, to, read, the, inscriptions, but, he, wrongly, believed, that, demotic, was, entirely, alphabetic, by, 1814, young, had, completely, translated, the, enchorial, text, of, the, rosetta, stone, using, a, list, with, 86, demotic, words, and, then, studied, the, hieroglyphic, alphabet, but, initially, failed, to, recognise, that, the, demotic, and, hieroglyphic, texts, were, paraphrases, and, not, simple, translations, there, was, considerable, rivalry, between, young, and, jean, fran, ois, champollion, while, both, were, working, on, hieroglyphic, decipherment, at, first, they, briefly, cooperated, in, their, work, but, later, from, around, 1815, a, chill, arose, between, them, for, many, years, they, kept, details, of, their, work, away, from, each, other, some, of, young, s, conclusions, appeared, in, the, famous, article, egypt, he, wrote, for, the, 1818, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, when, champollion, finally, published, a, translation, of, the, hieroglyphs, and, the, key, to, the, grammatical, system, in, 1822, young, and, many, others, praised, his, work, nevertheless, a, year, later, young, published, an, account, of, the, recent, discoveries, in, hieroglyphic, literature, and, egyptian, antiquities, with, the, aim, of, having, his, own, work, recognised, as, the, basis, for, champollion, s, system, young, had, correctly, found, the, sound, value, of, six, hieroglyphic, signs, but, had, not, deduced, the, grammar, of, the, language, young, himself, acknowledged, that, he, was, somewhat, at, a, disadvantage, because, champollion, s, knowledge, of, the, relevant, languages, such, as, coptic, was, much, greater, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, young, s, true, contribution, to, egyptology, was, his, decipherment, of, the, demotic, script, he, made, the, first, major, advances, in, this, area, he, also, correctly, identified, demotic, as, being, composed, by, both, ideographic, and, phonetic, signs, subsequently, young, felt, that, champollion, was, unwilling, to, share, the, credit, for, the, decipherment, in, the, ensuing, controversy, strongly, motivated, by, the, political, tensions, of, that, time, the, british, tended, to, champion, young, while, the, french, mostly, championed, champollion, champollion, did, acknowledge, some, of, young, s, contribution, but, rather, sparingly, however, after, 1826, when, champollion, was, a, curator, in, the, louvre, he, did, offer, young, access, to, demotic, manuscripts, in, england, while, sir, george, lewis, still, doubted, champollion, s, achievement, as, late, as, 1862, others, were, more, accepting, for, example, reginald, poole, and, sir, peter, le, page, renouf, both, defended, champollion, young, developed, young, temperament, a, method, of, tuning, musical, instruments, later, scholars, and, scientists, have, praised, young, s, work, although, they, may, know, him, only, through, achievements, he, made, in, their, fields, his, contemporary, sir, john, herschel, called, him, a, truly, original, genius, albert, einstein, praised, him, in, the, 1931, foreword, to, an, edition, of, isaac, newton, s, opticks, other, admirers, include, physicist, lord, rayleigh, and, nobel, physics, laureate, philip, anderson, thomas, young, s, name, has, been, adopted, as, the, name, of, the, london, based, thomas, young, centre, an, alliance, of, academic, research, groups, engaged, in, the, theory, and, simulation, of, materials, young, sound, in, eastern, greenland, was, named, in, his, honour, by, william, scoresby, 1789, 1857, works, cited
