poland, that, bears, his, name, and, was, previously, also, known, as, the, gediminid, dynasty, in, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, the, dynasty, ruled, both, states, until, 1572, and, became, one, of, the, most, influential, dynasties, in, late, medieval, and, early, modern, europe, jogaila, was, the, last, pagan, ruler, of, medieval, lithuania, after, he, became, king, of, poland, as, a, result, of, the, union, of, krewo, the, newly, formed, polish, lithuanian, union, confronted, the, growing, power, of, the, teutonic, order, the, allied, victory, at, the, battle, of, grunwald, in, 1410, followed, by, the, peace, of, thorn, secured, the, polish, and, lithuanian, borders, and, marked, the, emergence, of, the, polish, lithuanian, alliance, as, a, significant, force, in, europe, the, reign, of, w, adys, aw, ii, jagie, o, extended, polish, frontiers, and, is, often, considered, the, beginning, of, poland, s, golden, age, little, is, known, of, jogaila, s, early, life, and, even, his, year, of, birth, is, uncertain, previously, historians, assumed, he, was, born, in, 1352, but, some, recent, research, suggests, a, later, date, about, 1362, he, was, a, descendant, of, the, gediminid, dynasty, and, was, the, son, of, algirdas, grand, duke, of, lithuania, and, his, second, wife, uliana, of, tver, who, was, the, daughter, of, the, yaroslavichi, prince, alexander, of, tver, his, name, had, a, meaning, of, more, courageous, and, superior, than, others, he, spent, most, of, his, early, time, in, vilnius, at, his, father, s, manor, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, to, which, jogaila, succeeded, as, grand, duke, in, 1377, was, a, political, entity, composed, of, two, leading, but, very, different, nationalities, and, two, political, systems, ethnic, lithuania, in, the, north, west, and, the, vast, ruthenian, territories, of, former, kievan, rus, comprising, the, lands, of, modern, ukraine, belarus, and, parts, of, western, russia, at, first, jogaila, like, his, father, based, his, rule, in, the, southern, and, eastern, territories, of, lithuania, while, his, uncle, k, stutis, the, duke, of, trakai, continued, to, rule, the, north, western, region, jogaila, s, succession, however, soon, placed, this, system, of, dual, rule, under, strain, at, the, start, of, his, reign, jogaila, was, preoccupied, with, unrest, in, the, lithuanian, rus, lands, in, 1377, 78, andrei, of, polotsk, the, eldest, son, of, algirdas, challenged, jogaila, s, authority, and, sought, to, become, grand, duke, in, 1380, andrei, and, another, brother, dmitry, sided, with, prince, dmitri, of, moscow, against, jogaila, s, alliance, with, emir, mamai, de, facto, khan, of, the, golden, horde, jogaila, failed, to, support, mamai, lingering, in, the, vicinity, of, the, battlefield, which, led, to, mamai, s, army, s, significant, defeat, at, the, hands, of, prince, dmitri, in, the, battle, of, kulikovo, the, muscovites, pyrrhic, victory, over, the, golden, horde, in, the, long, term, signified, however, the, beginning, of, a, slow, climb, to, power, by, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, which, became, within, a, century, the, most, serious, rival, and, threat, to, the, integrity, well, being, and, survival, of, lithuania, however, in, 1380, muscovy, was, greatly, weakened, by, tremendous, losses, suffered, during, the, battle, and, thus, in, the, same, year, jogaila, was, free, to, begin, a, struggle, for, supremacy, with, k, stutis, in, the, north, west, lithuania, faced, constant, armed, incursions, from, the, teutonic, knights, founded, after, 1226, to, fight, and, convert, the, pagan, baltic, tribes, of, prussians, yotvingians, and, lithuanians, in, 1380, jogaila, concluded, the, secret, treaty, of, dovydi, k, s, directed, against, k, stutis, when, k, stutis, discovered, the, plan, the, lithuanian, civil, war, began, he, seized, vilnius, overthrew, jogaila, and, pronounced, himself, grand, duke, in, his, place, in, 1382, jogaila, raised, an, army, from, his, father, s, vassals, and, confronted, k, stutis, near, trakai, k, stutis, and, his, son, vytautas, entered, jogaila, s, encampment, for, negotiations, but, were, tricked, and, imprisoned, in, the, kreva, castle, where, k, stutis, was, found, dead, probably, murdered, a, week, later, vytautas, escaped, to, the, teutonic, fortress, of, marienburg, and, was, baptised, there, under, the, name, wigand, jogaila, formulated, the, treaty, of, dubysa, which, rewarded, the, knights, for, their, aid, in, defeating, k, stutis, and, vytautas, by, promising, christianisation, and, granting, them, samogitia, west, of, the, dubysa, river, however, when, jogaila, failed, to, ratify, the, treaty, the, knights, invaded, lithuania, in, the, summer, of, 1383, in, 1384, jogaila, reconciled, with, vytautas, promising, to, return, his, patrimony, in, trakai, vytautas, then, turned, against, the, knights, attacking, and, looting, several, prussian, castles, it, is, known, that, jogaila, being, ethnic, lithuanian, by, the, man, s, line, himself, knew, and, spoke, in, the, lithuanian, language, with, vytautas, his, cousin, from, the, gediminids, dynasty, also, during, the, christianization, of, samogitia, none, of, the, clergy, who, came, to, samogitia, with, jogaila, were, able, to, communicate, with, the, natives, therefore, jogaila, himself, taught, the, samogitians, about, the, catholicism, thus, he, was, able, to, communicate, in, the, samogitian, dialect, of, the, lithuanian, language, according, to, the, teutonic, order, s, testimonial, he, could, not, read, nor, write, and, had, to, listen, to, others, reading, for, him, jogaila, s, russian, mother, uliana, of, tver, urged, him, to, marry, sofia, daughter, of, prince, dmitri, of, moscow, who, required, him, first, to, convert, to, orthodoxy, that, option, however, was, unlikely, to, halt, the, crusades, against, lithuania, by, the, teutonic, knights, who, regarded, orthodox, christians, as, schismatics, and, little, better, than, heathens, jogaila, chose, therefore, to, accept, a, polish, proposal, to, become, a, catholic, and, marry, the, eleven, year, old, queen, jadwiga, of, poland, the, nobles, of, lesser, poland, made, this, offer, to, jogaila, for, many, reasons, they, wanted, to, neutralize, the, dangers, posed, by, lithuania, itself, and, to, secure, the, fertile, territories, of, galicia, volhynia, the, polish, nobles, saw, the, offer, as, an, opportunity, for, increasing, their, privileges, and, avoiding, austrian, influence, brought, by, jadwiga, s, previous, fianc, william, duke, of, austria, on, 14, august, 1385, in, kreva, castle, jogaila, confirmed, his, prenuptial, promises, in, the, union, of, krewo, union, of, kreva, the, promises, included, the, adoption, of, christianity, repatriation, of, lands, stolen, from, poland, by, its, neighbours, and, terras, suas, lithuaniae, et, russiae, coronae, regni, poloniae, perpetuo, applicare, a, clause, interpreted, by, historians, to, mean, anything, from, a, personal, union, between, lithuania, and, poland, to, a, complete, incorporation, of, lithuania, into, poland, the, agreement, at, kreva, has, been, described, both, as, far, sighted, and, as, a, desperate, gamble, jogaila, was, duly, baptised, at, the, wawel, cathedral, in, krak, w, on, 15, february, 1386, and, from, then, on, formally, used, the, name, w, adys, aw, or, latin, versions, of, it, the, marriage, took, place, three, days, later, and, on, 4, march, 1386, jogaila, was, crowned, king, w, adys, aw, by, archbishop, bodzanta, he, was, also, to, be, legally, adopted, by, jadwiga, s, mother, elizabeth, of, bosnia, so, retaining, the, throne, in, the, event, of, jadwiga, s, death, he, was, the, first, lithuanian, to, be, crowned, as, the, king, of, poland, the, royal, baptism, triggered, the, conversion, of, most, of, jogaila, s, court, and, noblemen, as, well, as, mass, baptisms, in, lithuanian, rivers, a, beginning, of, the, final, christianization, of, lithuania, though, the, ethnic, lithuanian, nobility, were, the, main, converts, to, catholicism, both, paganism, and, the, orthodox, rite, remained, strong, among, the, peasants, the, king, s, conversion, and, its, political, implications, created, lasting, repercussions, for, the, history, of, both, lithuania, and, poland, on, 22, february, 1387, he, banned, catholics, from, marriages, with, orthodox, and, demanded, those, orthodox, who, previously, married, with, the, catholics, to, convert, to, catholicism, w, adys, aw, ii, jagiello, and, jadwiga, reigned, as, co, monarchs, and, though, jadwiga, probably, had, little, real, power, she, took, an, active, part, in, poland, s, political, and, cultural, life, in, 1387, she, led, two, successful, military, expeditions, to, red, ruthenia, recovered, lands, her, father, louis, i, of, hungary, had, transferred, from, poland, to, hungary, and, secured, the, homage, of, voivode, petru, i, of, moldavia, in, 1390, she, also, personally, opened, negotiations, with, the, teutonic, order, most, political, responsibilities, however, fell, to, jagiello, with, jadwiga, attending, to, the, cultural, and, charitable, activities, for, which, she, is, still, revered, soon, after, jagiello, s, accession, to, the, polish, throne, jagiello, granted, vilnius, a, city, charter, like, that, of, krak, w, modeled, on, the, magdeburg, law, and, vytautas, issued, a, privilege, to, a, jewish, commune, of, trakai, on, almost, the, same, terms, as, privileges, issued, to, the, jews, of, poland, in, the, reigns, of, boleslaus, the, pious, and, casimir, the, great, w, adys, aw, s, policy, of, unifying, the, two, legal, systems, was, partial, and, uneven, at, first, but, achieved, a, lasting, influence, by, the, time, of, the, union, of, lublin, in, 1569, there, was, not, much, difference, between, the, administrative, and, judicial, systems, in, force, in, lithuania, and, poland, one, effect, of, jagiello, s, measures, was, to, be, the, advancement, of, catholics, in, lithuania, at, the, expense, of, orthodox, elements, in, 1387, and, 1413, for, example, lithuanian, catholic, boyars, were, granted, special, judicial, and, political, privileges, denied, to, the, orthodox, boyars, as, this, process, gained, momentum, it, was, accompanied, by, the, rise, of, both, rus, and, lithuanian, identity, in, the, fifteenth, century, jagiello, s, baptism, failed, to, end, the, crusade, of, the, teutonic, knights, who, claimed, his, conversion, was, a, sham, perhaps, even, a, heresy, and, renewed, their, incursions, on, the, pretext, that, pagans, remained, in, lithuania, from, then, on, however, the, order, found, it, harder, to, sustain, the, cause, of, a, crusade, and, faced, the, growing, threat, to, its, existence, posed, by, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, a, genuinely, christian, lithuania, alliance, w, adys, aw, sponsored, the, creation, of, the, diocese, of, vilnius, under, bishop, andrzej, wasilko, the, former, confessor, of, elizabeth, of, poland, the, bishopric, which, included, samogitia, then, largely, controlled, by, the, teutonic, order, was, subordinated, to, the, see, of, gniezno, and, not, to, that, of, teutonic, k, nigsberg, the, decision, may, not, have, improved, w, adys, aw, s, relations, with, the, order, but, it, served, to, introduce, closer, ties, between, lithuania, and, poland, enabling, the, polish, church, to, freely, assist, its, lithuanian, counterpart, in, 1389, w, adys, aw, s, rule, in, lithuania, faced, a, revived, challenge, from, vytautas, who, resented, the, power, given, to, skirgaila, in, lithuania, at, the, expense, of, his, own, patrimony, vytautas, started, a, civil, war, in, lithuania, aiming, to, become, the, grand, duke, on, 4, september, 1390, the, joint, forces, of, vytautas, and, grand, master, konrad, von, wallenrode, of, the, teutonic, order, laid, siege, to, vilnius, which, was, held, by, w, adys, aw, s, regent, skirgaila, with, combined, polish, lithuanian, and, ruthenian, troops, although, the, knights, lifted, the, siege, of, the, castle, after, a, month, they, reduced, much, of, the, outer, city, to, ruins, this, bloody, conflict, was, eventually, brought, to, a, temporary, halt, in, 1392, with, the, treaty, of, ostr, w, by, which, w, adys, aw, handed, over, the, government, of, lithuania, to, his, cousin, in, exchange, for, peace, vytautas, was, to, rule, lithuania, as, the, grand, duke, magnus, dux, until, his, death, under, the, overlordship, of, the, supreme, duke, dux, supremus, in, the, person, of, the, polish, monarch, skirgaila, was, moved, from, the, duchy, of, trakai, to, become, prince, of, kiev, vytautas, initially, accepted, his, status, but, soon, began, to, pursue, lithuania, s, independence, from, poland, the, protracted, period, of, war, between, the, lithuanians, and, the, teutonic, knights, was, ended, on, 12, october, 1398, by, the, treaty, of, salynas, named, after, the, islet, in, the, neman, river, where, it, was, signed, lithuania, agreed, to, cede, samogitia, and, assist, the, teutonic, order, in, a, campaign, to, seize, pskov, while, the, order, agreed, to, assist, lithuania, in, a, campaign, to, seize, novgorod, shortly, afterwards, vytautas, was, crowned, as, a, king, by, local, nobles, but, the, following, year, his, forces, and, those, of, his, ally, khan, tokhtamysh, of, the, white, horde, were, crushed, by, the, timurids, at, the, battle, of, the, vorskla, river, ending, his, imperial, ambitions, in, the, east, and, obliging, him, to, submit, to, w, adys, aw, s, protection, once, more, on, 22, june, 1399, jadwiga, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, baptised, elizabeth, bonifacia, but, within, a, month, the, mother, and, daughter, died, leaving, w, adys, aw, sole, ruler, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, without, an, heir, nor, much, legitimacy, to, rule, the, kingdom, jadwiga, s, death, undermined, w, adys, aw, s, right, to, the, throne, and, as, a, result, old, conflicts, between, the, nobility, of, lesser, poland, generally, sympathetic, to, w, adys, aw, and, the, gentry, of, greater, poland, began, to, surface, in, 1402, w, adys, aw, answered, the, rumblings, against, his, rule, by, marrying, anna, of, cilli, a, granddaughter, of, casimir, iii, of, poland, a, political, match, that, re, legitimised, his, reign, the, union, of, vilnius, and, radom, of, 1401, confirmed, the, status, of, vytautas, as, grand, duke, under, w, adys, aw, s, overlordship, while, assuring, the, title, of, grand, duke, to, the, heirs, of, w, adys, aw, rather, than, those, of, vytautas, should, w, adys, aw, die, without, heirs, the, lithuanian, boyars, were, to, elect, a, new, monarch, since, no, heir, had, yet, been, produced, by, either, monarch, the, implications, of, the, union, were, unforeseeable, but, it, forged, bonds, between, the, polish, and, lithuanian, nobility, and, a, permanent, defensive, alliance, between, the, two, states, strengthening, lithuania, s, hand, for, a, new, war, against, the, teutonic, order, in, which, poland, officially, took, no, part, while, the, document, left, the, liberties, of, the, polish, nobles, untouched, it, granted, increased, power, to, the, boyars, of, lithuania, whose, grand, dukes, had, till, then, been, unencumbered, by, checks, and, balances, of, the, sort, attached, to, the, polish, monarchy, the, union, of, vilnius, and, radom, therefore, earned, w, adys, aw, a, measure, of, support, in, lithuania, in, late, 1401, the, new, war, against, the, order, overstretched, the, resources, of, the, lithuanians, who, found, themselves, fighting, on, two, fronts, after, uprisings, in, the, eastern, provinces, another, of, w, adys, aw, s, brothers, the, malcontent, vitrigaila, chose, this, moment, to, stir, up, revolts, behind, the, lines, and, declare, himself, grand, duke, on, 31, january, 1402, he, presented, himself, in, marienburg, where, he, won, the, backing, of, the, knights, with, concessions, similar, to, those, made, by, jogaila, and, vytautas, during, earlier, leadership, contests, in, the, grand, duchy, the, war, ended, in, the, treaty, of, raci, on, 22, may, 1404, w, adys, aw, acceded, to, the, formal, cession, of, samogitia, and, agreed, to, support, the, order, s, designs, on, pskov, in, return, konrad, von, jungingen, undertook, to, sell, poland, the, disputed, dobrzy, land, and, the, town, of, z, otoryja, once, pawned, to, the, order, by, w, adys, aw, opolski, and, to, support, vytautas, in, a, revived, attempt, on, novgorod, both, sides, had, practical, reasons, for, signing, the, treaty, at, that, point, the, order, needed, time, to, fortify, its, newly, acquired, lands, the, poles, and, lithuanians, to, deal, with, territorial, challenges, in, the, east, and, in, silesia, also, in, 1404, w, adys, aw, held, talks, at, vratislav, with, wenceslaus, iv, of, bohemia, who, offered, to, return, silesia, to, poland, if, w, adys, aw, supported, him, in, his, power, struggle, within, the, holy, roman, empire, w, adys, aw, turned, the, deal, down, with, the, agreement, of, both, polish, and, silesian, nobles, unwilling, to, burden, himself, with, new, military, commitments, in, the, west, in, december, 1408, w, adys, aw, and, vytautas, held, strategic, talks, in, navahrudak, castle, where, they, decided, to, foment, a, samogitian, uprising, against, teutonic, rule, to, draw, german, forces, away, from, pomerelia, w, adys, aw, promised, to, repay, vytautas, for, his, support, by, restoring, samogitia, to, lithuania, in, any, future, peace, treaty, the, uprising, which, began, in, may, 1409, at, first, provoked, little, reaction, from, the, knights, who, had, not, yet, consolidated, their, rule, in, samogitia, by, building, castles, but, by, june, their, diplomats, were, busy, lobbying, w, adys, aw, s, court, at, oborniki, warning, his, nobles, against, polish, involvement, in, a, war, between, lithuania, and, the, order, w, adys, aw, however, bypassed, his, nobles, and, informed, new, grand, master, ulrich, von, jungingen, that, if, the, knights, acted, to, suppress, samogitia, poland, would, intervene, this, stung, the, order, into, issuing, a, declaration, of, war, against, poland, on, 6, august, which, w, adys, aw, received, on, 14, august, in, nowy, korczyn, the, castles, guarding, the, northern, border, were, in, such, bad, condition, that, the, knights, easily, captured, those, at, z, otoryja, dobrzy, and, bobrowniki, the, capital, of, dobrzy, land, while, german, burghers, invited, them, into, bydgoszcz, german, bromberg, w, adys, aw, arrived, on, the, scene, in, late, september, retook, bydgoszcz, within, a, week, and, came, to, terms, with, the, order, on, 8, october, during, the, winter, the, two, armies, prepared, for, a, major, confrontation, w, adys, aw, installed, a, strategic, supply, depot, at, p, ock, in, masovia, and, had, a, pontoon, bridge, constructed, and, transported, north, down, the, vistula, meanwhile, both, sides, unleashed, diplomatic, offensives, the, knights, dispatched, letters, to, the, monarchs, of, europe, preaching, their, usual, crusade, against, the, heathens, w, adys, aw, countered, with, his, own, letters, to, the, monarchs, accusing, the, order, of, planning, to, conquer, the, whole, world, such, appeals, successfully, recruited, many, foreign, knights, to, each, side, wenceslas, iv, of, bohemia, signed, a, defensive, treaty, with, the, poles, against, the, teutonic, order, his, brother, sigismund, of, luxembourg, allied, himself, with, the, order, and, declared, war, against, poland, on, 12, july, though, his, hungarian, vassals, refused, his, call, to, arms, when, the, war, resumed, in, june, 1410, w, adys, aw, advanced, into, the, teutonic, heartland, at, the, head, of, an, army, of, about, 20, 000, mounted, nobles, 15, 000, armed, commoners, and, 2, 000, professional, cavalry, mainly, hired, from, bohemia, after, crossing, the, vistula, over, the, pontoon, bridge, at, czerwi, sk, his, troops, met, up, with, those, of, vytautas, whose, 11, 000, light, cavalry, included, lithuanians, ruthenians, and, tatars, the, teutonic, order, s, army, had, about, 18, 000, cavalry, mostly, germans, and, 5, 000, infantry, on, 15, july, at, the, battle, of, grunwald, after, one, of, the, largest, and, most, ferocious, battles, of, the, middle, ages, the, allies, won, a, victory, so, overwhelming, that, the, teutonic, order, s, army, was, virtually, annihilated, with, most, of, its, key, commanders, killed, in, combat, including, grand, master, ulrich, von, jungingen, and, grand, marshal, friedrich, von, wallenrode, thousands, of, troops, were, reportedly, slaughtered, on, either, side, the, road, to, the, teutonic, capital, marienburg, now, lay, open, the, city, undefended, but, for, reasons, the, sources, do, not, explain, w, adys, aw, hesitated, to, pursue, his, advantage, on, 17, july, his, army, began, a, laboured, advance, arriving, at, marienburg, only, on, 25, july, by, which, time, the, new, grand, master, heinrich, von, plauen, had, organised, a, defence, of, the, fortress, the, apparent, half, heartedness, of, the, ensuing, siege, called, off, by, w, adys, aw, on, 19, september, has, been, variously, ascribed, to, the, impregnability, of, the, fortifications, high, lithuanian, casualties, to, w, adys, aw, s, unwillingness, to, risk, further, casualties, or, to, his, desire, to, keep, the, order, weakened, but, undefeated, so, as, to, not, upset, the, balance, of, power, between, poland, which, would, most, likely, acquire, most, of, the, order, possessions, if, it, was, totally, defeated, and, lithuania, but, a, lack, of, sources, precludes, a, definitive, explanation, the, war, ended, in, 1411, with, the, peace, of, thorn, in, which, neither, poland, nor, lithuania, drove, home, negotiating, advantages, home, to, the, full, much, to, the, discontent, of, the, polish, nobility, poland, regained, dobrzy, land, lithuania, regained, samogitia, and, masovia, regained, a, small, territory, beyond, the, wkra, river, most, of, the, teutonic, order, s, territory, however, including, towns, that, had, surrendered, remained, intact, w, adys, aw, then,

too, exhausted, from, the, previous, war, to, risk, a, major, battle, and, the, fighting, petered, out, in, the, autumn, hostilities, did, not, flare, up, again, until, 1419, during, the, council, of, constance, when, they, were, called, off, at, the, papal, legate, s, insistence, the, council, of, constance, proved, a, turning, point, in, the, teutonic, crusades, as, it, did, for, several,

to, the, forced, conversion, of, heathens, and, to, the, order, s, aggression, against, lithuania, and, poland, as, a, result, of, the, polish, lithuanian, diplomacy, the, council, though, scandalised, by, w, odkowic, s, questioning, of, the, legitimacy, of, the, monastic, state, denied, the, order, s, request, for, a, further, crusade, and, instead, entrusted, the, conversion, of, the, samogitians, to, poland, lithuania, the, diplomatic, context, at, constance, included, the, revolt, of, the, bohemian, hussites, who, looked, upon, poland, as, an, ally, in, their, wars, against,

largely, unchanged, for, roughly, 500, years, until, 1920, the, terms, of, this, treaty, have, however, been, seen, as, turning, a, polish, victory, into, defeat, as, a, result, of, w, adys, aw, s, renunciation, of, polish, claims, to, pomerania, pomerelia, and, che, mno, land, for, which, he, received, only, the, town, of, nieszawa, in, return, the, treaty, of, melno, closed, a, chapter, in,
