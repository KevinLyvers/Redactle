originally, been, jewish, but, had, converted, to, catholic, christianity, a, generation, before, nostradamus, was, born, he, studied, at, the, university, of, avignon, but, was, forced, to, leave, after, just, over, a, year, when, the, university, closed, due, to, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, he, worked, as, an, apothecary, for, several, years, before, entering, the, university, of, montpellier, hoping, to, earn, a, doctorate, but, was, almost, immediately, expelled, after, his, work, as, an, apothecary, a, manual, trade, forbidden, by, university, statutes, was, discovered, he, first, married, in, 1531, but, his, wife, and, two, children, died, in, 1534, during, another, plague, outbreak, he, worked, against, the, plague, alongside, other, doctors, before, remarrying, to, anne, ponsarde, with, whom, he, had, six, children, he, wrote, an, almanac, for, 1550, and, as, a, result, of, its, success, continued, writing, them, for, future, years, as, he, began, working, as, an, astrologer, for, various, wealthy, patrons, catherine, de, medici, became, one, of, his, foremost, supporters, his, les, proph, ties, published, in, 1555, relied, heavily, on, historical, and,

july, 1566, many, popular, authors, have, retold, apocryphal, legends, about, his, life, in, the, years, since, the, publication, of, his, les, proph, ties, nostradamus, has, attracted, many, supporters, who, along, with, some, of, the, popular, press, credit, him, with, having, accurately, predicted, many, major, world, events, academic, sources, reject, the, notion, that, nostradamus, had, any, genuine, supernatural, prophetic, abilities, and, maintain, that, the, associations, made, between, world, events, and, nostradamus, s, quatrains, are, the, result, of, sometimes, deliberate, misinterpretations, or, mistranslations, these, academics, also, argue, that, nostradamus, s, predictions, are, characteristically, vague, meaning, they, could, be, applied, to, virtually, anything, and, are, useless, for, determining, whether, their, author, had, any, real, prophetic, powers, nostradamus, was, born, on, either, 14, or, 21, december, 1503, in, saint, r, my, de, provence, provence, france, where, his, claimed, birthplace, still, exists, and, baptized, michel, he, was, one, of, at, least, nine, children, of, notary, jaume, or, jacques, de, nostredame, and,

conversion, was, solemnised, the, earliest, ancestor, who, can, be, identified, on, the, paternal, side, is, astruge, of, carcassonne, who, died, about, 1420, michel, s, known, siblings, included, delphine, jean, c, 1507, 1577, pierre, hector, louis, bertrand, jean, ii, born, 1522, and, antoine, born, 1523, little, else, is, known, about, his, childhood, although, there, is, a, persistent, tradition, that, he, was, educated, by, his, maternal, great, grandfather, jean, de, st, r, my, a, tradition, which, is, somewhat, undermined, by, the, fact, that, the, latter, disappears, from, the, historical, record, after, 1504, when, the, child, was, only, one, year, old, at, the, age, of, 14, nostradamus, entered, the, university, of, avignon, to, study, for, his, baccalaureate, after, little, more, than, a, year, when, he, would, have, studied, the, regular, trivium, of, grammar, rhetoric, and, logic, rather, than, the, later, quadrivium, of, geometry, arithmetic, music, and, astronomy, astrology, he, was, forced, to, leave, avignon, when, the, university, closed, its, doors, during, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, after, leaving, avignon, nostradamus, by, his, own, account, traveled, the, countryside, for, eight, years, from, 1521, researching, herbal, remedies, in, 1529, after, some, years, as, an, apothecary, he, entered, the, university, of, montpellier, to, study, for, a, doctorate, in, medicine, he, was, expelled, shortly, afterwards, by, the, student, procurator, guillaume, rondelet, when, it, was, discovered, that, he, had, been, an, apothecary, a, manual, trade, expressly, banned, by, the, university, statutes, and, had, been, slandering, doctors, the, expulsion, document, biu, montpellier, register, s, 2, folio, 87, still, exists, in, the, faculty, library, some, of, his, publishers, and, correspondents, would, later, call, him, doctor, after, his, expulsion, nostradamus, continued, working, presumably, still, as, an, apothecary, and, became, famous, for, creating, a, rose, pill, that, purportedly, protected, against, the, plague, in, 1531, nostradamus, was, invited, by, jules, c, sar, scaliger, a, leading, renaissance, scholar, to, come, to, agen, there, he, married, a, woman, of, uncertain, name, possibly, henriette, d, encausse, with, whom, he, had, two, children, in, 1534, his, wife, and, children, died, presumably, from, the, plague, after, their, deaths, he, continued, to, travel, passing, through, france, and, possibly, italy, on, his, return, in, 1545, he, assisted, the, prominent, physician, louis, serre, in, his, fight, against, a, major, plague, outbreak, in, marseille, and, then, tackled, further, outbreaks, of, disease, on, his, own, in, salon, de, provence, and, in, the, regional, capital, aix, en, provence, finally, in, 1547, he, settled, in, salon, de, provence, in, the, house, which, exists, today, where, he, married, a, rich, widow, named, anne, ponsarde, with, whom, he, had, six, children, three, daughters, and, three, sons, between, 1556, and, 1567, he, and, his, wife, acquired, a, one, thirteenth, share, in, a, huge, canal, project, organised, by, adam, de, craponne, to, create, the, canal, de, craponne, to, irrigate, the, largely, waterless, salon, de, provence, and, the, nearby, d, sert, de, la, crau, from, the, river, durance, after, another, visit, to, italy, nostradamus, began, to, move, away, from, medicine, and, toward, the, occult, following, popular, trends, he, wrote, an, almanac, for, 1550, for, the, first, time, in, print, latinising, his, name, to, nostradamus, he, was, so, encouraged, by, the, almanac, s, success, that, he, decided, to, write, one, or, more, annually, taken, together, they, are, known, to, have, contained, at, least, 6, 338, prophecies, as, well, as, at, least, eleven, annual, calendars, all, of, them, starting, on, 1, january, and, not, as, is, sometimes, supposed, in, march, it, was, mainly, in, response, to, the, almanacs, that, the, nobility, and, other, prominent, people, from, far, away, soon, started, asking, for, horoscopes, and, psychic, advice, from, him, though, he, generally, expected, his, clients, to, supply, the, birth, charts, on, which, these, would, be, based, rather, than, calculating, them, himself, as, a, professional, astrologer, would, have, done, when, obliged, to, attempt, this, himself, on, the, basis, of, the, published, tables, of, the, day, he, frequently, made, errors, and, failed, to, adjust, the, figures, for, his, clients, place, or, time, of, birth, he, then, began, his, project, of, writing, a, book, of, one, thousand, mainly, french, quatrains, which, constitute, the, largely, undated, prophecies, for, which, he, is, most, famous, today, feeling, vulnerable, to, opposition, on, religious, grounds, he, devised, a, method, of, obscuring, his, meaning, by, using, virgilianised, syntax, word, games, and, a, mixture, of, other, languages, such, as, greek, italian, latin, and, proven, al, for, technical, reasons, connected, with, their, publication, in, three, instalments, the, publisher, of, the, third, and, last, instalment, seems, to, have, been, unwilling, to, start, it, in, the, middle, of, a, century, or, book, of, 100, verses, the, last, fifty, eight, quatrains, of, the, seventh, century, have, not, survived, in, any, extant, edition, the, quatrains, published, in, a, book, titled, les, proph, ties, the, prophecies, received, a, mixed, reaction, when, they, were, published, some, people, thought, nostradamus, was, a, servant, of, evil, a, fake, or, insane, while, many, of, the, elite, evidently, thought, otherwise, catherine, de, medici, wife, of, king, henry, ii, of, france, was, one, of, nostradamus, s, greatest, admirers, after, reading, his, almanacs, for, 1555, which, hinted, at, unnamed, threats, to, the, royal, family, she, summoned, him, to, paris, to, explain, them, and, to, draw, up, horoscopes, for, her, children, at, the, time, he, feared, that, he, would, be, beheaded, but, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1566, queen, catherine, had, made, him, counselor, and, physician, in, ordinary, to, her, son, the, young, king, charles, ix, of, france, some, accounts, of, nostradamus, s, life, state, that, he, was, afraid, of, being, persecuted, for, heresy, by, the, inquisition, but, neither, prophecy, nor, astrology, fell, in, this, bracket, and, he, would, have, been, in, danger, only, if, he, had, practised, magic, to, support, them, in, 1538, he, came, into, conflict, with, the, church, in, agen, after, an, inquisitor, visited, the, area, looking, for, anti, catholic, views, his, brief, imprisonment, at, marignane, in, late, 1561, was, solely, because, he, had, violated, a, recent, royal, decree, by, publishing, his, 1562, almanac, without, the, prior, permission, of, a, bishop, by, 1566, nostradamus, gout, which, had, plagued, him, painfully, for, many, years, and, made, movement, very, difficult, turned, into, edema, in, late, june, he, summoned, his, lawyer, to, draw, up, an, extensive, will, bequeathing, his, property, plus, 3, 444, crowns, around, us, 300, 000, today, minus, a, few, debts, to, his, wife, pending, her, remarriage, in, trust, for, her, sons, pending, their, twenty, fifth, birthdays, and, her, daughters, pending, their, marriages, this, was, followed, by, a, much, shorter, codicil, on, the, evening, of, 1, july, he, is, alleged, to, have, told, his, secretary, jean, de, chavigny, you, will, not, find, me, alive, at, sunrise, the, next, morning, he, was, reportedly, found, dead, lying, on, the, floor, next, to, his, bed, and, a, bench, presage, 141, for, november, 1567, as, posthumously, edited, by, chavigny, to, fit, what, happened, he, was, buried, in, the, local, franciscan, chapel, in, salon, part, of, it, now, incorporated, into, the, restaurant, la, brocherie, but, re, interred, during, the, french, revolution, in, the, coll, giale, saint, laurent, where, his, tomb, remains, to, this, day, in, the, prophecies, nostradamus, compiled, his, collection, of, major, long, term, predictions, the, first, installment, was, published, in, 1555, and, contained, 353, quatrains, the, third, edition, with, three, hundred, new, quatrains, was, reportedly, printed, in, 1558, but, now, survives, as, only, part, of, the, omnibus, edition, that, was, published, after, his, death, in, 1568, this, version, contains, one, unrhymed, and, 941, rhymed, quatrains, grouped, into, nine, sets, of, 100, and, one, of, 42, called, centuries, given, printing, practices, at, the, time, which, included, type, setting, from, dictation, no, two, editions, turned, out, to, be, identical, and, it, is, relatively, rare, to, find, even, two, copies, that, are, exactly, the, same, certainly, there, is, no, warrant, for, assuming, as, would, be, code, breakers, are, prone, to, do, that, either, the, spellings, or, the, punctuation, of, any, edition, are, nostradamus, s, originals, the, almanacs, by, far, the, most, popular, of, his, works, were, published, annually, from, 1550, until, his, death, he, often, published, two, or, three, in, a, year, entitled, either, almanachs, detailed, predictions, prognostications, or, presages, more, generalised, predictions, nostradamus, was, not, only, a, diviner, but, a, professional, healer, it, is, known, that, he, wrote, at, least, two, books, on, medical, science, one, was, an, extremely, free, translation, or, rather, a, paraphrase, of, the, protreptic, of, galen, paraphrase, de, c, galien, sus, l, exhortation, de, menodote, aux, estudes, des, bonnes, artz, mesmement, medicine, and, in, his, so, called, trait, des, fardemens, basically, a, medical, cookbook, containing, once, again, materials, borrowed, mainly, from, others, he, included, a, description, of, the, methods, he, used, to, treat, the, plague, including, bloodletting, none, of, which, apparently, worked, the, same, book, also, describes, the, preparation, of, cosmetics, a, manuscript, normally, known, as, the, orus, apollo, also, exists, in, the, lyon, municipal, library, where, upwards, of, 2, 000, original, documents, relating, to, nostradamus, are, stored, under, the, aegis, of, michel, chomarat, it, is, a, purported, translation, of, an, ancient, greek, work, on, egyptian, hieroglyphs, based, on, later, latin, versions, all, of, them, unfortunately, ignorant, of, the, true, meanings, of, the, ancient, egyptian, script, which, was, not, correctly, deciphered, until, champollion, in, the, 19th, century, since, his, death, only, the, prophecies, have, continued, to, be, popular, but, in, this, case, they, have, been, quite, extraordinarily, so, over, two, hundred, editions, of, them, have, appeared, in, that, time, together, with, over, 2, 000, commentaries, their, persistence, in, popular, culture, seems, to, be, partly, because, their, vagueness, and, lack, of, dating, make, it, easy, to, quote, them, selectively, after, every, major, dramatic, event, and, retrospectively, claim, them, as, hits, nostradamus, claimed, to, base, his, published, predictions, on, judicial, astrology, the, astrological, judgment, or, assessment, of, the, quality, and, thus, potential, of, events, such, as, births, weddings, coronations, etc, but, was, heavily, criticised, by, professional, astrologers, of, the, day, such, as, laurens, videl, for, incompetence, and, for, assuming, that, comparative, horoscopy, the, comparison, of, future, planetary, configurations, with, those, accompanying, known, past, events, could, actually, predict, what, would, happen, in, the, future, research, suggests, that, much, of, his, prophetic, work, paraphrases, collections, of, ancient, end, of, the, world, prophecies, mainly, bible, based, supplemented, with, references, to, historical, events, and, anthologies, of, omen, reports, and, then, projects, those, into, the, future, in, part, with, the, aid, of, comparative, horoscopy, hence, the, many, predictions, involving, ancient, figures, such, as, sulla, gaius, marius, nero, and, others, as, well, as, his, descriptions, of, battles, in, the, clouds, and, frogs, falling, from, the, sky, astrology, itself, is, mentioned, only, twice, in, nostradamus, s, preface, and, 41, times, in, the, centuries, themselves, but, more, frequently, in, his, dedicatory, letter, to, king, henry, ii, in, the, last, quatrain, of, his, sixth, century, he, specifically, attacks, astrologers, his, historical, sources, include, easily, identifiable, passages, from, livy, suetonius, the, twelve, caesars, plutarch, and, other, classical, historians, as, well, as, from, medieval, chroniclers, such, as, geoffrey, of, villehardouin, and, jean, froissart, many, of, his, astrological, references, are, taken, almost, word, for, word, from, richard, roussat, s, livre, de, l, estat, et, mutations, des, temps, of, 1549, 50, one, of, his, major, prophetic, sources, was, evidently, the, mirabilis, liber, of, 1522, which, contained, a, range, of, prophecies, by, pseudo, methodius, the, tiburtine, sibyl, joachim, of, fiore, savonarola, and, others, his, preface, contains, 24, biblical, quotations, all, but, two, in, the, order, used, by, savonarola, this, book, had, enjoyed, considerable, success, in, the, 1520s, when, it, went, through, half, a, dozen, editions, but, did, not, sustain, its, influence, perhaps, owing, to, its, mostly, latin, text, mixed, with, ancient, greek, and, modern, french, and, proven, al, gothic, script, and, many, difficult, abbreviations, nostradamus, was, one, of, the, first, to, re, paraphrase, these, prophecies, in, french, which, may, explain, why, they, are, credited, to, him, modern, views, of, plagiarism, did, not, apply, in, the, 16th, century, authors, frequently, copied, and, paraphrased, passages, without, acknowledgement, especially, from, the, classics, the, latest, research, suggests, that, he, may, in, fact, have, used, bibliomancy, for, this, randomly, selecting, a, book, of, history, or, prophecy, and, taking, his, cue, from, whatever, page, it, happened, to, fall, open, at, further, material, was, gleaned, from, the, de, honesta, disciplina, of, 1504, by, petrus, crinitus, which, included, extracts, from, michael, psellos, s, de, daemonibus, and, the, de, mysteriis, aegyptiorum, concerning, the, mysteries, of, egypt, a, book, on, chaldean, and, assyrian, magic, by, iamblichus, a, 4th, century, neo, platonist, latin, versions, of, both, had, recently, been, published, in, lyon, and, extracts, from, both, are, paraphrased, in, the, second, case, almost, literally, in, his, first, two, verses, the, first, of, which, is, appended, to, this, article, while, it, is, true, that, nostradamus, claimed, in, 1555, to, have, burned, all, of, the, occult, works, in, his, library, no, one, can, say, exactly, what, books, were, destroyed, in, this, fire, only, in, the, 17th, century, did, people, start, to, notice, his, reliance, on, earlier, mainly, classical, sources, nostradamus, s, reliance, on, historical, precedent, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, he, explicitly, rejected, the, label, prophet, i, e, a, person, having, prophetic, powers, of, his, own, on, several, occasions, although, my, son, i, have, used, the, word, prophet, i, would, not, attribute, to, myself, a, title, of, such, lofty, sublimity, not, that, i, would, attribute, to, myself, either, the, name, or, the, role, of, a, prophet, ome, of, predicted, great, and, marvelous, things, to, come, for, me, i, in, no, way, attribute, to, myself, such, a, title, here, not, that, i, am, foolish, enough, to, claim, to, be, a, prophet, given, this, reliance, on, literary, sources, it, is, unlikely, that, nostradamus, used, any, particular, methods, for, entering, a, trance, state, other, than, contemplation, meditation, and, incubation, his, sole, description, of, this, process, is, contained, in, letter, 41, of, his, collected, latin, correspondence, the, popular, legend, that, he, attempted, the, ancient, methods, of, flame, gazing, water, gazing, or, both, simultaneously, is, based, on, a, naive, reading, of, his, first, two, verses, which, merely, liken, his, efforts, to, those, of, the, delphic, and, branchidic, oracles, the, first, of, these, is, reproduced, at, the, bottom, of, this, article, and, the, second, can, be, seen, by, visiting, the, relevant, facsimile, site, see, external, links, in, his, dedication, to, king, henry, ii, nostradamus, describes, emptying, my, soul, mind, and, heart, of, all, care, worry, and, unease, through, mental, calm, and, tranquility, but, his, frequent, references, to, the, bronze, tripod, of, the, delphic, rite, are, usually, preceded, by, the, words, as, though, compare, once, again, external, references, to, the, original, texts, most, of, the, quatrains, deal, with, disasters, such, as, plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and, battles, all, undated, and, based, on, foreshadowings, by, the, mirabilis, liber, some, quatrains, cover, these, disasters, in, overall, terms, others, concern, a, single, person, or, small, group, of, people, some, cover, a, single, town, others, several, towns, in, several, countries, a, major, underlying, theme, is, an, impending, invasion, of, europe, by, muslim, forces, from, farther, east, and, south, headed, by, the, expected, antichrist, directly, reflecting, the, then, current, ottoman, invasions, and, the, earlier, saracen, equivalents, as, well, as, the, prior, expectations, of, the, mirabilis, liber, all, of, this, is, presented, in, the, context, of, the, supposedly, imminent, end, of, the, world, even, though, this, is, not, in, fact, mentioned, a, conviction, that, sparked, numerous, collections, of, end, time, prophecies, at, the, time, including, an, unpublished, collection, by, christopher, columbus, views, on, nostradamus, have, varied, widely, throughout, history, academic, views, such, as, those, of, jacques, halbronn, regard, nostradamus, s, prophecies, as, antedated, forgeries, written, by, later, authors, for, political, reasons, many, of, nostradamus, s, supporters, believe, his, prophecies, are, genuine, owing, to, the, subjective, nature, of, these, interpretations, no, two, of, them, completely, agree, on, what, nostradamus, predicted, whether, for, the, past, or, for, the, future, many, supporters, do, agree, for, example, that, he, predicted, the, great, fire, of, london, the, french, revolution, the, rise, of, napoleon, and, of, adolf, hitler, both, world, wars, and, the, nuclear, destruction, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, popular, authors, frequently, claim, that, he, predicted, whatever, major, event, had, just, happened, at, the, time, of, each, of, their, books, publication, such, as, the, apollo, moon, landing, in, 1969, the, space, shuttle, challenger, disaster, in, 1986, the, death, of, diana, princess, of, wales, in, 1997, and, the, september, 11, attacks, on, the, world, trade, center, in, 2001, this, movable, feast, aspect, appears, to, be, characteristic, of, the, genre, possibly, the, first, of, these, books, to, become, popular, in, english, was, henry, c, roberts, the, complete, prophecies, of, nostradamus, of, 1947, reprinted, at, least, seven, times, during, the, next, forty, years, which, contained, both, transcriptions, and, translations, with, brief, commentaries, this, was, followed, in, 1961, reprinted, in, 1982, by, edgar, leoni, s, nostradamus, and, his, prophecies, after, that, came, erika, cheetham, s, the, prophecies, of, nostradamus, incorporating, a, reprint, of, the, posthumous, 1568, edition, which, was, reprinted, revised, and, republished, several, times, from, 1973, onwards, latterly, as, the, final, prophecies, of, nostradamus, this, served, as, the, basis, for, the, documentary, the, man, who, saw, tomorrow, and, both, did, indeed, mention, possible, generalised, future, attacks, on, new, york, via, nuclear, weapons, though, not, specifically, on, the, world, trade, center, or, on, any, particular, date, a, two, part, translation, of, jean, charles, de, fontbrune, s, nostradamus, historien, et, proph, te, was, published, in, 1980, and, john, hogue, has, published, a, number, of, books, on, nostradamus, from, about, 1987, including, nostradamus, and, the, millennium, predictions, of, the, future, nostradamus, the, complete, prophecies, 1999, and, nostradamus, a, life, and, myth, 2003, in, 1992, one, commentator, who, claimed, to, be, able, to, contact, nostradamus, under, hypnosis, even, had, him, interpreting, his, own, verse, x, 6, a, prediction, specifically, about, floods, in, southern, france, around, the, city, of, n, mes, and, people, taking, refuge, in, its, collosse, or, colosseum, a, roman, amphitheatre, now, known, as, the, ar, nes, as, a, prediction, of, an, undated, attack, on, the, pentagon, despite, the, historical, seer, s, clear, statement, in, his, dedicatory, letter, to, king, henri, ii, that, his, prophecies, were, about, europe, north, africa, and, part, of, asia, minor, with, the, exception, of, roberts, these, books, and, their, many, popular, imitators, were, almost, unanimous, not, merely, about, nostradamus, s, powers, of, prophecy, but, also, in, inventing, intriguing, aspects, of, his, purported, biography, that, he, had, been, a, descendant, of, the, israelite, tribe, of, issachar, he, had, been, educated, by, his, grandfathers, who, had, both, been, physicians, to, the, court, of, good, king, ren, of, provence, he, had, attended, montpellier, university, in, 1525, to, gain, his, first, degree, after, returning, there, in, 1529, he, had, successfully, taken, his, medical, doctorate, he, had, gone, on, to, lecture, in, the, medical, faculty, there, until, his, views, became, too, unpopular, he, had, supported, the, heliocentric, view, of, the, universe, he, had, travelled, to, the, habsburg, netherlands, where, he, had, composed, prophecies, at, the, abbey, of, orval, in, the, course, of, his, travels, he, had, performed, a, variety, of, prodigies, including, identifying, future, pope, sixtus, v, who, was, then, only, a, seminary, monk, he, is, credited, with, having, successfully, cured, the, plague, at, aix, en, provence, and, elsewhere, he, had, engaged, in, scrying, using, either, a, magic, mirror, or, a, bowl, of, water, he, had, been, joined, by, his, secretary, chavigny, at, easter, 1554, having, published, the, first, installment, of, his, proph, ties, he, had, been, summoned, by, queen, catherine, de, medici, to, paris, in, 1556, to, discuss, with, her, his, prophecy, at, quatrain, i, 35, that, her, husband, king, henri, ii, would, be, killed, in, a, duel, he, had, examined, the, royal, children, at, blois, he, had, bequeathed, to, his, son, a, lost, book, of, his, own, prophetic, paintings, he, had, been, buried, standing, up, and, he, had, been, found, when, dug, up, at, the, french, revolution, to, be, wearing, a, medallion, bearing, the, exact, date, of, his, disinterment, this, was, first, recorded, by, samuel, pepys, as, early, as, 1667, long, before, the, french, revolution, pepys, records, in, his, celebrated, diary, a, legend, that, before, his, death, nostradamus, made, the, townsfolk, swear, that, his, grave, would, never, be, disturbed, but, that, 60, years, later, his, body, was, exhumed, whereupon, a, brass, plaque, was, found, on, his, chest, correctly, stating, the, date, and, time, when, his, grave, would, be, opened, and, cursing, the, exhumers, in, 2000, li, hongzhi, claimed, that, the, 1999, prophecy, at, x, 72, was, a, prediction, of, the, chinese, falun, gong, persecution, which, began, in, july, 1999, leading, to, an, increased, interest, in, nostradamus, among, falun, gong, members, from, the, 1980s, onward, an, academic, reaction, set, in, especially, in, france, the, publication, in, 1983, of, nostradamus, private, correspondence, and, during, succeeding, years, of, the, original, editions, of, 1555, and, 1557, discovered, by, chomarat, and, benazra, together, with, the, unearthing, of, much, original, archival, material, revealed, that, much, that, was, claimed, about, nostradamus, did, not, fit, the, documented, facts, the, academics, revealed, that, not, one, of, the, claims, just, listed, was, backed, up, by, any, known, contemporary, documentary, evidence, most, of, them, had, evidently, been, based, on, unsourced, rumours, relayed, as, fact, by, much, later, commentators, such, as, jaubert, 1656, guynaud, 1693, and, bareste, 1840, on, modern, misunderstandings, of, the, 16th, century, french, texts, or, on, pure, invention, even, the, often, advanced, suggestion, that, quatrain, i, 35, had, successfully, prophesied, king, henry, ii, s, death, did, not, actually, appear, in, print, for, the, first, time, until, 1614, 55, years, after, the, event, skeptics, such, as, james, randi, suggest, that, his, reputation, as, a, prophet, is, largely, manufactured, by, modern, day, supporters, who, fit, his, words, to, events, that, have, either, already, occurred, or, are, so, imminent, as, to, be, inevitable, a, process, sometimes, known, as, retroactive, clairvoyance, postdiction, no, nostradamus, quatrain, is, known, to, have, been, interpreted, as, predicting, a, specific, event, before, it, occurred, other, than, in, vague, general, terms, that, could, equally, apply, to, any, number, of, other, events, this, even, applies, to, quatrains, that, contain, specific, dates, such, as, iii, 77, which, predicts, in, 1727, in, october, the, king, of, persia, captured, by, those, of, egypt, a, prophecy, that, has, as, ever, been, interpreted, retrospectively, in, the, light, of, later, events, in, this, case, as, though, it, presaged, the, known, peace, treaty, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, persia, of, that, year, egypt, was, also, an, important, ottoman, territory, at, this, time, similarly, nostradamus, s, notorious, 1999, prophecy, at, x, 72, see, nostradamus, in, popular, culture, describes, no, event, that, commentators, have, succeeded, in, identifying, either, before, or, since, other, than, by, twisting, the, words, to, fit, whichever, of, the, many, contradictory, happenings, they, claim, as, hits, moreover, no, quatrain, suggests, as, is, often, claimed, by, books, and, films, on, the, alleged, mayan, prophecy, that, the, world, would, end, in, december, 2012, in, his, preface, to, the, prophecies, nostradamus, himself, stated, that, his, prophecies, extend, from, now, to, the, year, 3797, an, extraordinary, date, which, given, that, the, preface, was, written, in, 1555, may, have, more, than, a, little, to, do, with, that, 2242, 3797, 1555, had, recently, been, proposed, by, his, major, astrological, source, richard, roussat, as, a, possible, date, for, the, end, of, the, world, additionally, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, almost, all, english, translations, of, nostradamus, s, quatrains, are, of, extremely, poor, quality, they, seem, to, display, little, or, no, knowledge, of, 16th, century, french, are, tendentious, and, are, sometimes, intentionally, altered, in, order, to, make, them, fit, whatever, events, to, which, the, translator, believed, they, were, supposed, to, refer, or, vice, versa, none, of, them, were, based, on, the, original, editions, roberts, had, based, his, writings, on, that, of, 1672, cheetham, and, hogue, on, the, posthumous, edition, of, 1568, even, leoni, accepted, on, page, 115, that, he, had, never, seen, an, original, edition, and, on, earlier, pages, he, indicated, that, much, of, his, biographical, material, was, unsourced, none, of, this, research, and, criticism, was, originally, known, to, most, of, the, english, language, commentators, by, dint, of, the, dates, when, they, were, writing, and, to, some, extent, the, language, in, which, it, was, written, hogue, was, in, a, position, to, take, advantage, of, it, but, it, was, only, in, 2003, that, he, accepted, that, some, of, his, earlier, biographical, material, had, in, fact, been, apocryphal, meanwhile, some, of, the, more, recent, sources, listed, lemesurier, gruber, wilson, have, been, particularly, scathing, about, later, attempts, by, some, lesser, known, authors, and, internet, enthusiasts, to, extract, alleged, hidden, meanings, from, the, texts, whether, with, the, aid, of, anagrams, numerical, codes, graphs, or, otherwise, an, additional, indictment, is, found, in, a, connection, to, nazi, propaganda, goebbels, reportedly, adduced, some, of, nostradamus, work, to, be, third, reich, references, this, allegedly, was, done, to, make, it, look, like, the, 1, 000, year, triumphant, reign, of, the, german, people, that, was, expected, under, nazism, had, been, prophesied, by, nostradamus, in, particular, a, line, referring, to, that, people, which, stands, under, the, sign, of, the, crooked, cross, was, added, as, an, allusion, to, the, german, people, standing, under, the, nazi, flag, with, its, swastika, goebbels, reportedly, had, that, line, inserted, into, leather, bound, original, volumes, of, nostradamus, work, volumes, that, were, then, seeded, in, libraries, across, nazi, occupied, europe, so, that, the, line, would, seem, credible, the, prophecies, retold, and, expanded, by, nostradamus, figured, largely, in, popular, culture, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, as, well, as, being, the, subject, of, hundreds, of, books, both, fiction, and, nonfiction, nostradamus, life, has, been, depicted, in, several, films, and, videos, and, his, life, and, writings, continue, to, be, a, subject, of, media, interest
