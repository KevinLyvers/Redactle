changed, with, the, political, and, social, climate, of, the, age, the, contrasting, views, of, him, continued, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, literary, critic, douglas, kerr, wrote, is, still, an, author, who, can, inspire, passionate, disagreement, and, his, place, in, literary, and, cultural, history, is, far, from, settled, but, as, the, age, of, the, european, empires, recedes, he, is, recognised, as, an, incomparable, if, controversial, interpreter, of, how, empire, was, experienced, that, and, an, increasing, recognition, of, his, extraordinary, narrative, gifts, make, him, a, force, to, be, reckoned, with, rudyard, kipling, was, born, on, 30, december, 1865, in, bombay, in, the, bombay, presidency, of, british, india, to, alice, kipling, born, macdonald, and, john, lockwood, kipling, alice, one, of, the, four, noted, macdonald, sisters, was, a, vivacious, woman, of, whom, lord, dufferin, would, say, dullness, and, mrs, kipling, cannot, exist, in, the, same, room, john, lockwood, kipling, a, sculptor, and, pottery, designer, was, the, principal, and, professor, of, architectural, sculpture, at, the, newly, founded, sir, jamsetjee, jeejebhoy, school, of, art, in, bombay, john, lockwood, and, alice, met, in, 1863, and, courted, at, rudyard, lake, in, rudyard, staffordshire, england, they, married, and, moved, to, india, in, 1865, after, john, lockwood, had, accepted, the, position, as, professor, at, the, school, of, art, they, had, been, so, moved, by, the, beauty, of, the, rudyard, lake, area, that, they, named, their, first, child, after, it, joseph, rudyard, two, of, alice, s, sisters, were, married, to, artists, georgiana, to, the, painter, edward, burne, jones, and, her, sister, agnes, to, edward, poynter, a, third, sister, louisa, was, the, mother, of, kipling, s, most, prominent, relative, his, first, cousin, stanley, baldwin, who, was, conservative, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, three, times, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, kipling, s, birth, home, on, the, campus, of, the, j, j, school, of, art, in, bombay, was, for, many, years, used, as, the, dean, s, residence, although, a, cottage, bears, a, plaque, noting, it, as, his, birth, site, the, original, one, may, have, been, torn, down, and, replaced, decades, ago, some, historians, and, conservationists, take, the, view, that, the, bungalow, marks, a, site, merely, close, to, the, home, of, kipling, s, birth, as, it, was, built, in, 1882, about, 15, years, after, kipling, was, born, kipling, seems, to, have, said, as, much, to, the, dean, when, visiting, j, j, school, in, the, 1930s, kipling, wrote, of, bombay, mother, of, cities, to, me, for, i, was, born, in, her, gate, between, the, palms, and, the, sea, where, the, world, end, steamers, wait, according, to, bernice, m, murphy, kipling, s, parents, considered, themselves, anglo, indians, and, so, too, would, their, son, though, he, spent, the, bulk, of, his, life, elsewhere, complex, issues, of, identity, and, national, allegiance, would, become, prominent, in, his, fiction, kipling, referred, to, such, conflicts, for, example, in, the, afternoon, heats, before, we, took, our, sleep, she, the, portuguese, ayah, or, nanny, or, meeta, the, hindu, bearer, or, male, attendant, would, tell, us, stories, and, indian, nursery, songs, all, unforgotten, and, we, were, sent, into, the, dining, room, after, we, had, been, dressed, with, the, caution, speak, english, now, to, papa, and, mamma, so, one, spoke, english, haltingly, translated, out, of, the, vernacular, idiom, that, one, thought, and, dreamed, in, kipling, s, days, of, strong, light, and, darkness, in, bombay, ended, when, he, was, five, as, was, the, custom, in, british, india, he, and, his, three, year, old, sister, alice, trix, were, taken, to, the, united, kingdom, in, their, case, to, southsea, portsmouth, to, live, with, a, couple, who, boarded, children, of, british, nationals, living, abroad, for, the, next, six, years, from, october, 1871, to, april, 1877, the, children, lived, with, the, couple, captain, pryse, agar, holloway, once, an, officer, in, the, merchant, navy, and, sarah, holloway, at, their, house, lorne, lodge, 4, campbell, road, southsea, kipling, referred, to, the, place, as, the, house, of, desolation, in, his, autobiography, published, 65, years, later, kipling, recalled, the, stay, with, horror, and, wondered, if, the, combination, of, cruelty, and, neglect, that, he, experienced, there, at, the, hands, of, mrs, holloway, might, not, have, hastened, the, onset, of, his, literary, life, if, you, cross, examine, a, child, of, seven, or, eight, on, his, day, s, doings, specially, when, he, wants, to, go, to, sleep, he, will, contradict, himself, very, satisfactorily, if, each, contradiction, be, set, down, as, a, lie, and, retailed, at, breakfast, life, is, not, easy, i, have, known, a, certain, amount, of, bullying, but, this, was, calculated, torture, religious, as, well, as, scientific, yet, it, made, me, give, attention, to, the, lies, i, soon, found, it, necessary, to, tell, and, this, i, presume, is, the, foundation, of, literary, effort, trix, fared, better, at, lorne, lodge, mrs, holloway, apparently, hoped, that, trix, would, eventually, marry, the, holloways, son, the, two, kipling, children, however, had, no, relatives, in, england, they, could, visit, except, that, they, spent, a, month, each, christmas, with, a, maternal, aunt, georgiana, georgy, and, her, husband, edward, burne, jones, at, their, house, the, grange, in, fulham, london, which, kipling, called, a, paradise, which, i, verily, believe, saved, me, in, the, spring, of, 1877, alice, returned, from, india, and, removed, the, children, from, lorne, lodge, kipling, remembers, often, and, often, afterwards, the, beloved, aunt, would, ask, me, why, i, had, never, told, any, one, how, i, was, being, treated, children, tell, little, more, than, animals, for, what, comes, to, them, they, accept, as, eternally, established, also, badly, treated, children, have, a, clear, notion, of, what, they, are, likely, to, get, if, they, betray, the, secrets, of, a, prison, house, before, they, are, clear, of, it, alice, took, the, children, during, spring, 1877, to, goldings, farm, at, loughton, where, a, carefree, summer, and, autumn, was, spent, on, the, farm, and, adjoining, forest, some, of, the, time, with, stanley, baldwin, in, january, 1878, kipling, was, admitted, to, the, united, services, college, at, westward, ho, devon, a, school, recently, founded, to, prepare, boys, for, the, army, it, proved, rough, going, for, him, at, first, but, later, led, to, firm, friendships, and, provided, the, setting, for, his, schoolboy, stories, stalky, co, 1899, while, there, kipling, met, and, fell, in, love, with, florence, garrard, who, was, boarding, with, trix, at, southsea, to, which, trix, had, returned, florence, became, the, model, for, maisie, in, kipling, s, first, novel, the, light, that, failed, 1891, near, the, end, of, his, schooling, it, was, decided, that, kipling, did, not, have, the, academic, ability, to, get, into, oxford, university, on, a, scholarship, his, parents, lacked, the, wherewithal, to, finance, him, and, so, kipling, s, father, obtained, a, job, for, him, in, lahore, where, the, father, served, as, principal, of, the, mayo, college, of, art, and, curator, of, the, lahore, museum, kipling, was, to, be, assistant, editor, of, a, local, newspaper, the, civil, and, military, gazette, he, sailed, for, india, on, 20, september, 1882, and, arrived, in, bombay, on, 18, october, he, described, the, moment, years, later, so, at, sixteen, years, and, nine, months, but, looking, four, or, five, years, older, and, adorned, with, real, whiskers, which, the, scandalised, mother, abolished, within, one, hour, of, beholding, i, found, myself, at, bombay, where, i, was, born, moving, among, sights, and, smells, that, made, me, deliver, in, the, vernacular, sentences, whose, meaning, i, knew, not, other, indian, born, boys, have, told, me, how, the, same, thing, happened, to, them, this, arrival, changed, kipling, as, he, explains, there, were, yet, three, or, four, days, rail, to, lahore, where, my, people, lived, after, these, my, english, years, fell, away, nor, ever, i, think,

departmental, ditties, that, year, also, brought, a, change, of, editors, at, the, newspaper, kay, robinson, the, new, editor, allowed, more, creative, freedom, and, kipling, was, asked, to, contribute, short, stories, to, the, newspaper, in, an, article, printed, in, the, chums, boys, annual, an, ex, colleague, of, kipling, s, stated, that, he, never, knew, such, a, fellow, for, ink, he, simply, revelled, in, it, filling, up, his, pen, viciously, and, then, throwing, the, contents, all, over, the, office, so, that, it, was, almost, dangerous, to, approach, him, the, anecdote, continues, in, the, hot, weather, when, he, kipling, wore, only, white, trousers, and, a, thin, vest, he, is, said, to, have, resembled, a, dalmatian, dog, more, than, a, human, being, for, he, was, spotted, all, over, with, ink, in, every, direction, in, the, summer, of, 1883, kipling, visited, simla, today, s, shimla, a, well, known, hill, station, and, the, summer, capital, of, british, india,

pure, joy, every, golden, hour, counted, it, began, in, heat, and, discomfort, by, rail, and, road, it, ended, in, the, cool, evening, with, a, wood, fire, in, one, s, bedroom, and, next, morn, thirty, more, of, them, ahead, the, early, cup, of, tea, the, mother, who, brought, it, in, and, the, long, talks, of, us, all, together, again, one, had, leisure, to, work, too, at, whatever, play,

escaped, lunatics, from, india, be, they, ever, so, full, of, admiration, as, it, was, twain, gladly, welcomed, kipling, and, had, a, two, hour, conversation, with, him, on, trends, in, anglo, american, literature, and, about, what, twain, was, going, to, write, in, a, sequel, to, tom, sawyer, with, twain, assuring, kipling, that, a, sequel, was, coming, although, he, had, not, decided, upon, the, ending, either, sawyer, would, be, elected, to, congress, or, he, would, be, hanged, twain, also, passed, along, the, literary, advice, that, an, author, should, get, your, facts, first, and, then, you, can, distort, em, as, much, as, you, please, twain, who, rather, liked, kipling, later, wrote, of, their, meeting, between, us, we, cover, all, knowledge, he, covers, all, that, can,

were, small, not, over, clean, or, well, kept, but, from, my, desk, i, could, look, out, of, my, window, through, the, fanlight, of, gatti, s, music, hall, entrance, across, the, street, almost, on, to, its, stage, the, charing, cross, trains, rumbled, through, my, dreams, on, one, side, the, boom, of, the, strand, on, the, other, while, before, my, windows, father, thames, under, the, shot,

accepted, by, wolcott, s, sister, caroline, starr, balestier, 1862, 1939, called, carrie, whom, he, had, met, a, year, earlier, and, with, whom, he, had, apparently, been, having, an, intermittent, romance, meanwhile, late, in, 1891, a, collection, of, his, short, stories, on, the, british, in, india, life, s, handicap, was, published, in, london, on, 18, january, 1892, carrie, balestier, aged, 29, and, rudyard, kipling, aged, 26, married, in, london, in, the, thick, of, an, influenza, epidemic, when, the, undertakers, had, run, out, of, black, horses, and, the, dead, had, to, be, content, with, brown, ones, the, wedding, was, held, at, all, souls, church, in, langham, place, central, london, henry, james, gave, away, the, bride, kipling, and, his, wife, settled, upon, a, honeymoon,

discovered, that, their, bank, the, new, oriental, banking, corporation, had, failed, taking, this, loss, in, their, stride, they, returned, to, the, u, s, back, to, vermont, carrie, by, this, time, was, pregnant, with, their, first, child, and, rented, a, small, cottage, on, a, farm, near, brattleboro, for, 10, a, month, according, to, kipling, we, furnished, it, with, a, simplicity, that, fore, ran, the, hire, purchase, system, we, bought, second, or, third, hand, a, huge, hot, air, stove, which, we, installed, in, the, cellar, we, cut, generous, holes, in, our, thin, floors, for, its, eight, inch, tin, pipes, why, we, were, not, burned, in, our, beds, each, week, of, the, winter, i, never, can, understand, and, we, were, extraordinarily, and, self, centredly, content, in, this, house, which, they, called, bliss, cottage, their, first, child, josephine, was, born, in, three, foot, of, snow, on, the, night, of, 29th, december, 1892, her, mother, s, birthday, being, the, 31st, and, mine, the, 30th, of, the, same, month, we, congratulated, her, on, her, sense, of, the, fitness, of, things, it, was, also, in, this, cottage, that, the, first, dawnings, of, the, jungle, books, came, to, kipling, the, workroom, in, the, bliss, cottage, was, seven, feet, by, eight, and, from, december, to, april, the, snow, lay, level, with, its, window, sill, it, chanced, that, i, had, written, a, tale, about, indian, forestry, work, which, included, a, boy, who, had, been, brought, up, by, wolves, in, the, stillness, and, suspense, of, the, winter, of, 92, some, memory, of, the, masonic, lions, of, my, childhood, s, magazine, and, a, phrase, in, haggard, s, nada, the, lily, combined, with, the, echo, of, this, tale, after, blocking, out, the, main, idea, in, my, head, the, pen, took, charge, and, i, watched, it, begin, to, write, stories, about, mowgli, and, animals, which, later, grew, into, the, two, jungle, books, with, josephine, s, arrival, bliss, cottage, was, felt, to, be, congested, so, eventually, the, couple, bought, land, 10, acres, 4, 0, ha, on, a, rocky, hillside, overlooking, the, connecticut, river, from, carrie, s, brother, beatty, balestier, and, built, their, own, house, kipling, named, this, naulakha, in, honour, of, wolcott, and, of, their, collaboration, and, this, time, the, name, was, spelt, correctly, from, his, early, years, in, lahore, 1882, 87, kipling, had, become, enamoured, with, the, mughal, architecture, especially, the, naulakha, pavilion, situated, in, lahore, fort, which, eventually, inspired, the, title, of, his, novel, as, well, as, the, house, the, house, still, stands, on, kipling, road, three, miles, 4, 8, km, north, of, brattleboro, in, dummerston, vermont, a, big, secluded, dark, green, house, with, shingled, roof, and, sides, which, kipling, called, his, ship, and, which, brought, him, sunshine, and, a, mind, at, ease, his, seclusion, in, vermont, combined, with, his, healthy, sane, clean, life, made, kipling, both, inventive, and, prolific, in, a, mere, four, years, he, produced, along, with, the, jungle, books, a, book, of, short, stories, the, day, s, work, a, novel, captains, courageous, and, a, profusion, of, poetry, including, the, volume, the, seven, seas, the, collection, of, barrack, room, ballads, was, issued, in, march, 1892, first, published, individually, for, the, most, part, in, 1890, and, contained, his, poems, mandalay, and, gunga, din, he, especially, enjoyed, writing, the, jungle, books, and, also, corresponding, with, many, children, who, wrote, to, him, about, them, the, writing, life, in, naulakha, was, occasionally, interrupted, by, visitors, including, his, father, who, visited, soon, after, his, retirement, in, 1893, and, the, british, writer, arthur, conan, doyle, who, brought, his, golf, clubs, stayed, for, two, days, and, gave, kipling, an, extended, golf, lesson, kipling, seemed, to, take, to, golf, occasionally, practising, with, the, local,

with, old, oak, staircase, and, all, untouched, and, unfaked, it, is, a, good, and, peaceable, place, we, have, loved, it, ever, since, our, first, sight, of, it, from, a, november, 1902, letter, in, the, non, fiction, realm, he, became, involved, in, the, debate, over, the, british, response, to, the, rise, in, german, naval, power, known, as, the, tirpitz, plan, to, build, a, fleet, to,

little, children, published, in, 1902, the, year, after, kim, the, american, art, historian, janice, leoshko, and, the, american, literary, scholar, david, scott, have, argued, that, kim, disproves, the, claim, by, edward, said, that, kipling, was, a, promoter, of, orientalism, since, kipling, who, was, deeply, interested, in, buddhism, presented, tibetan, buddhism, in, a, fairly, sympathetic, light, and, aspects, of, the, novel, appeared, to, reflect, a, buddhist, understanding, of, the, universe, kipling, was, offended, by, the, german, emperor, wilhelm, ii, s, hun, speech, hunnenrede, in, 1900, urging, german, troops, being, sent, to, china, to, crush, the, boxer, rebellion, to, behave, like, huns, and, take, no, prisoners, in, a, 1902, poem, the, rowers, kipling, attacked, the, kaiser, as, a, threat, to, britain, and, made, the, first, use, of, the, term, hun, as, an, anti, german, insult, using, wilhelm, s, own, words, and, the, actions, of, german, troops, in, china, to, portray, germans, as, essentially, barbarian, in, an, interview, with, the, french, newspaper, le, figaro, the, francophile, kipling, called, germany, a, menace, and, called, for, an, anglo, french, alliance, to, stop, it, in, another, letter, at, the, same, time, kipling, described, the, unfrei, peoples, of, central, europe, as, living, in, the, middle, ages, with, machine, guns, kipling, wrote, a, number, of, speculative, fiction, short, stories, including, the, army, of, a, dream, in, which, he, sought, to, show, a, more, efficient, and, responsible, army, than, the, hereditary, bureaucracy, of, england, at, the, time, and, two, science, fiction, stories, with, the, night, mail, 1905, and, as, easy, as, a, b, c, 1912, both, were, set, in, the, 21st, century, in, kipling, s, aerial, board, of, control, universe, they, read, like, modern, hard, science, fiction, and, introduced, the, literary, technique, known, as, indirect, exposition, which, would, later, become, one, of, science, fiction, writer, robert, heinlein, s, hallmarks, this, technique, is, one, that, kipling, picked, up, in, india, and, used, to, solve, the, problem, of, his, english, readers, not, understanding, much, about, indian, society, when, writing, the, jungle, book, in, 1907, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, having, been, nominated, in, that, year, by, charles, oman, professor, at, the, university, of, oxford, the, prize, citation, said, it, was, in, consideration, of, the, power, of, observation, originality, of, imagination, virility, of, ideas, and, remarkable, talent, for, narration, which, characterize, the, creations, of, this, world, famous, author, nobel, prizes, had, been, established, in, 1901, and, kipling, was, the, first, english, language, recipient, at, the, award, ceremony, in, stockholm, on, 10, december, 1907, the, permanent, secretary, of, the, swedish, academy, carl, david, af, wirs, n, praised, both, kipling, and, three, centuries, of, english, literature, the, swedish, academy, in, awarding, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, this, year, to, rudyard, kipling, desires, to, pay, a, tribute, of, homage, to, the, literature, of, england, so, rich, in, manifold, glories, and, to, the, greatest, genius, in, the, realm, of, narrative, that, that, country, has, produced, in, our, times, to, book, end, this, achievement, came, the, publication, of, two, connected, poetry, and, story, collections, puck, of, pook, s, hill, 1906, and, rewards, and, fairies, 1910, the, latter, contained, the, poem, if, in, a, 1995, bbc, opinion, poll, it, was, voted, the, uk, s, favourite, poem, this, exhortation, to, self, control, and, stoicism, is, arguably, kipling, s, most, famous, poem, such, was, kipling, s, popularity, that, he, was, asked, by, his, friend, max, aitken, to, intervene, in, the, 1911, canadian, election, on, behalf, of, the, conservatives, in, 1911, the, major, issue, in, canada, was, a, reciprocity, treaty, with, the, united, states, signed, by, the, liberal, prime, minister, sir, wilfrid, laurier, and, vigorously, opposed, by, the, conservatives, under, sir, robert, borden, on, 7, september, 1911, the, montreal, daily, star, newspaper, published, a, front, page, appeal, against, the, agreement, by, kipling, who, wrote, it, is, her, own, soul, that, canada, risks, today, once, that, soul, is, pawned, for, any, consideration, canada, must, inevitably, conform, to, the, commercial, legal, financial, social, and, ethical, standards, which, will, be, imposed, on, her, by, the, sheer, admitted, weight, of, the, united, states, at, the, time, the, montreal, daily, star, was, canada, s, most, read, newspaper, over, the, next, week, kipling, s, appeal, was, reprinted, in, every, english, newspaper, in, canada, and, is, credited, with, helping, to, turn, canadian, public, opinion, against, the, liberal, government, kipling, sympathised, with, the, anti, home, rule, stance, of, irish, unionists, who, opposed, irish, autonomy, he, was, friends, with, edward, carson, the, dublin, born, leader, of, ulster, unionism, who, raised, the, ulster, volunteers, to, prevent, home, rule, in, ireland, kipling, wrote, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, that, ireland, was, not, a, nation, and, that, before, the, english, arrived, in, 1169, the, irish, were, a, gang, of, cattle, thieves, living, in, savagery, and, killing, each, other, while, writing, dreary, poems, about, it, all, in, his, view, it, was, only, british, rule, that, allowed, ireland, to, advance, a, visit, to, ireland, in, 1911, confirmed, kipling, s, prejudices, he, wrote, that, the, irish, countryside, was, beautiful, but, spoiled, by, what, he, called, the, ugly, homes, of, irish, farmers, with, kipling, adding, that, god, had, made, the, irish, into, poets, having, deprived, them, of, love, of, line, or, knowledge, of, colour, in, contrast, kipling, had, nothing, but, praise, for, the, decent, folk, of, the, protestant, minority, and, unionist, ulster, free, from, the, threat, of, constant, mob, violence, kipling, wrote, the, poem, ulster, in, 1912, reflecting, his, unionist, politics, kipling, often, referred, to, the, irish, unionists, as, our, party, kipling, had, no, sympathy, or, understanding, for, irish, nationalism, seeing, home, rule, as, an, act, of, treason, by, the, government, of, the, liberal, prime, minister, h, h, asquith, that, would, plunge, ireland, into, the, dark, ages, and, allow, the, irish, catholic, majority, to, oppress, the, protestant, minority, the, scholar, david, gilmour, wrote, that, kipling, s, lack, of, understanding, of, ireland, could, be, seen, in, his, attack, on, john, redmond, the, anglophile, leader, of, the, irish, parliamentary, party, who, wanted, home, rule, because, he, believed, it, was, the, best, way, of, keeping, the, united, kingdom, together, as, a, traitor, working, to, break, up, the, united, kingdom, ulster, was, first, publicly, read, at, an, unionist, rally, in, belfast, where, the, largest, union, jack, ever, made, was, unfolded, kipling, admitted, it, was, meant, to, strike, a, hard, blow, against, the, asquith, government, s, home, rule, bill, rebellion, rapine, hate, oppression, wrong, and, greed, are, loosed, to, rule, our, fate, by, england, s, act, and, deed, ulster, generated, much, controversy, with, the, conservative, mp, sir, mark, sykes, who, as, a, unionist, was, opposed, to, the, home, rule, bill, condemning, ulster, in, the, morning, post, as, a, direct, appeal, to, ignorance, and, a, deliberate, attempt, to, foster, religious, hate, kipling, was, a, staunch, opponent, of, bolshevism, a, position, which, he, shared, with, his, friend, henry, rider, haggard, the, two, had, bonded, on, kipling, s, arrival, in, london, in, 1889, largely, due, to, their, shared, opinions, and, remained, lifelong, friends, according, to, the, english, magazine, masonic, illustrated, kipling, became, a, freemason, in, about, 1885, before, the, usual, minimum, age, of, 21, being, initiated, into, hope, and, perseverance, lodge, no, 782, in, lahore, he, later, wrote, to, the, times, i, was, secretary, for, some, years, of, the, lodge, which, included, brethren, of, at, least, four, creeds, i, was, entered, by, a, member, from, brahmo, somaj, a, hindu, passed, by, a, mohammedan, and, raised, by, an, englishman, our, tyler, was, an, indian, jew, kipling, received, not, only, the, three, degrees, of, craft, masonry, but, also, the, side, degrees, of, mark, master, mason, and, royal, ark, mariner, kipling, so, loved, his, masonic, experience, that, he, memorialised, its, ideals, in, his, poem, the, mother, lodge, and, used, the, fraternity, and, its, symbols, as, vital, plot, devices, in, his, novella, the, man, who, would, be, king, at, the, beginning, of, the, first, world, war, like, many, other, writers, kipling, wrote, pamphlets, and, poems, enthusiastically, supporting, the, uk, war, aims, of, restoring, belgium, after, it, had, been, occupied, by, germany, together, with, generalised, statements, that, britain, was, standing, up, for, the, cause, of, good, in, september, 1914, kipling, was, asked, by, the, government, to, write, propaganda, an, offer, that, he, accepted, kipling, s, pamphlets, and, stories, were, popular, with, the, british, people, during, the, war, his, major, themes, being, to, glorify, the, british, military, as, the, place, for, heroic, men, to, be, while, citing, german, atrocities, against, belgian, civilians, and, the, stories, of, women, brutalised, by, a, horrific, war, unleashed, by, germany, yet, surviving, and, triumphing, in, spite, of, their, suffering, kipling, was, enraged, by, reports, of, the, rape, of, belgium, together, with, the, sinking, of, the, rms, lusitania, in, 1915, which, he, saw, as, a, deeply, inhumane, act, which, led, him, to, see, the, war, as, a, crusade, for, civilisation, against, barbarism, in, a, 1915, speech, kipling, declared, there, was, no, crime, no, cruelty, no, abomination, that, the, mind, of, men, can, conceive, of, which, the, german, has, not, perpetrated, is, not, perpetrating, and, will, not, perpetrate, if, he, is, allowed, to, go, on, today, there, are, only, two, divisions, in, the, world, human, beings, and, germans, alongside, his, passionate, antipathy, towards, germany, kipling, was, privately, deeply, critical, of, how, the, war, was, being, fought, by, the, british, army, shocked, by, the, heavy, losses, that, the, british, expeditionary, force, had, taken, by, the, autumn, of, 1914, he, blamed, the, entire, pre, war, generation, of, british, politicians, who, kipling, argued, had, failed, to, learn, the, lessons, of, the, boer, war, thus, thousands, of, british, soldiers, were, now, paying, with, their, lives, for, their, failure, in, the, fields, of, france, and, belgium, kipling, had, scorn, for, men, who, shirked, duty, in, the, first, world, war, in, the, new, army, in, training, 1915, kipling, concluded, by, saying, this, much, we, can, realise, even, though, we, are, so, close, to, it, the, old, safe, instinct, saves, us, from, triumph, and, exultation, but, what, will, be, the, position, in, years, to, come, of, the, young, man, who, has, deliberately, elected, to, outcaste, himself, from, this, all, embracing, brotherhood, what, of, his, family, and, above, all, what, of, his, descendants, when, the, books, have, been, closed, and, the, last, balance, struck, of, sacrifice, and, sorrow, in, every, hamlet, village, parish, suburb, city, shire, district, province, and, dominion, throughout, the, empire, in, 1914, kipling, was, one, of, 53, leading, british, authors, a, number, that, included, h, g, wells, arthur, conan, doyle, and, thomas, hardy, who, signed, their, names, to, the, authors, declaration, this, manifesto, declared, that, the, german, invasion, of, belgium, had, been, a, brutal, crime, and, that, britain, could, not, without, dishonour, have, refused, to, take, part, in, the, present, war, kipling, s, only, son, john, was, killed, in, action, at, the, battle, of, loos, in, september, 1915, at, age, 18, john, initially, wanted, to, join, the, royal, navy, but, having, had, his, application, turned, down, after, a, failed, medical, examination, due, to, poor, eyesight, he, opted, to, apply, for, military, service, as, an, army, officer, again, his, eyesight, was, an, issue, during, the, medical, examination, in, fact, he, tried, twice, to, enlist, but, was, rejected, his, father, had, been, lifelong, friends, with, lord, roberts, former, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, army, and, colonel, of, the, irish, guards, and, at, rudyard, s, request, john, was, accepted, into, the, irish, guards, john, kipling, was, sent, to, loos, two, days, into, the, battle, in, a, reinforcement, contingent, he, was, last, seen, stumbling, through, the, mud, blindly, with, a, possible, facial, injury, a, body, identified, as, his, was, found, in, 1992, although, that, identification, has, been, challenged, in, 2015, the, commonwealth, war, grave, commission, confirmed, that, it, had, correctly, identified, the, burial, place, of, john, kipling, they, record, his, date, of, death, as, 27, september, 1915, and, that, he, is, buried, at, st, mary, s, a, d, s, cemetery, haisnes, after, his, son, s, death, in, a, poem, titled, epitaphs, of, the, war, kipling, wrote, if, any, question, why, we, died, tell, them, because, our, fathers, lied, critics, have, speculated, that, these, words, may, express, kipling, s, guilt, over, his, role, in, arranging, john, s, commission, professor, tracy, bilsing, contends, that, the, line, refers, to, kipling, s, disgust, that, british, leaders, failed, to, learn, the, lessons, of, the, boer, war, and, were, unprepared, for, the, struggle, with, germany, in, 1914, with, the, lie, of, the, fathers, being, that, the, british, army, was, prepared, for, any, war, when, it, was, not, john, s, death, has, been, linked, to, kipling, s, 1916, poem, my, boy, jack, notably, in, the, play, my, boy, jack, and, its, subsequent, television, adaptation, along, with, the, documentary, rudyard, kipling, a, remembrance, tale, however, the, poem, was, originally, published, at, the, head, of, a, story, about, the, battle, of, jutland, and, appears, to, refer, to, a, death, at, sea, the, jack, referred, to, may, be, the, boy, vc, jack, cornwell, or, perhaps, a, generic, jack, tar, in, the, kipling, family, jack, was, the, name, of, the, family, dog, while, john, kipling, was, always, john, making, the, identification, of, the, protagonist, of, my, boy, jack, with, john, kipling, questionable, however, kipling, was, indeed, emotionally, devastated, by, the, death, of, his, son, he, is, said, to, have, assuaged, his, grief, by, reading, the, novels, of, jane, austen, aloud, to,

set, to, music, by, the, english, composer, edward, elgar, kipling, became, friends, with, a, french, soldier, named, maurice, hammoneau, whose, life, had, been, saved, in, the, first, world, war, when, his, copy, of, kim, which, he, had, in, his, left, breast, pocket, stopped, a, bullet, hammoneau, presented, kipling, with, the, book, with, bullet, still, embedded, and, his, croix, de, guerre, as, a, token, of, gratitude, they, continued, to, correspond, and, when, hammoneau, had, a, son, kipling, insisted, on, returning, the, book, and, medal, on, 1, august, 1918, the, poem, the, old, volunteer, appeared, under, his, name, in, the, times, the, next, day, he, wrote, to, the, newspaper, to, disclaim, authorship, and, a, correction, appeared, although, the, times, employed, a, private, detective, to, investigate, the, detective, appears, to, have, suspected, kipling, of, being, the, author, and, the, identity, of, the, hoaxer, was, never, established, partly, in, response, to, john, s, death, kipling, joined, sir, fabian, ware, s, imperial, war, graves, commission, now, the, commonwealth, war, graves, commission, the, group, responsible, for, the, garden, like, british,

contributions, to, the, project, were, his, selection, of, the, biblical, phrase, their, name, liveth, for, evermore, ecclesiasticus, 44, 14, kjv, found, on, the, stones, of, remembrance, in, larger, war, cemeteries, and, his, suggestion, of, the, phrase, known, unto, god, for, the, gravestones, of, unidentified, servicemen, he, also, chose, the, inscription, the, glorious, dead, on, the, cenotaph, whitehall, london, additionally, he, wrote, a, two, volume, history, of, the, irish, guards, his, son, s, regiment, published, in, 1923, and, seen, as, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, regimental, history, kipling, s, short, story, the, gardener, depicts, visits, to, the, war, cemeteries, and, the, poem, the, king, s, pilgrimage, 1922, a, journey, which, king, george, v, made, touring, the, cemeteries, and, memorials, under, construction, by, the, imperial, war, graves, commission, with, the, increasing, prevalence, of, the, automobile, kipling, became, a, motoring, correspondent, for, the, british, press, writing, enthusiastically, of, trips, around, england, and, abroad, though, he, was, usually, driven, by, a, chauffeur, after, the, war, kipling, was, sceptical, of, the, fourteen, points, and, the, league, of, nations, but, had, hopes, that, the, united, states, would, abandon, isolationism, and, the, post, war, world, be, dominated, by, an, anglo, french, american, alliance, he, hoped, the, united, states, would, take, on, a, league, of, nations, mandate, for, armenia, as, the, best, way, of, preventing, isolationism, and, hoped, that, theodore, roosevelt, whom, kipling, admired, would, again, become, president, kipling, was, saddened, by, roosevelt, s, death, in, 1919, believing, him, to, be, the, only, american, politician, capable, of, keeping, the, united, states, in, the, game, of, world, politics, kipling, was, hostile, towards, communism, writing, of, the, bolshevik, take, over, in, 1917, that, one, sixth, of, the, world, had, passed, bodily, out, of, civilization, in, a, 1918, poem, kipling, wrote, of, soviet, russia, that, everything, good, in, russia, had, been, destroyed, by, the, bolsheviks, all, that, was, left, was, the, sound, of, weeping, and, the, sight, of, burning, fire, and, the, shadow, of, a, people, trampled, into, the, mire, in, 1920, kipling, co, founded, the, liberty, league, with, haggard, and, lord, sydenham, this, short, lived, enterprise, focused, on, promoting, classic, liberal, ideals, as, a, response, to, the, rising, power, of, communist, tendencies, within, great, britain, or, as, kipling, put, it, to, combat, the, advance, of, bolshevism, in, 1922, kipling, having, referred, to, the, work, of, engineers, in, some, of, his, poems, such, as, the, sons, of, martha, sappers, and, mcandrew, s, hymn, and, in, other, writings, including, short, story, anthologies, such, as, the, day, s, work, was, asked, by, a, university, of, toronto, civil, engineering, professor, herbert, e, t, haultain, for, assistance, in, developing, a, dignified, obligation, and, ceremony, for, graduating, engineering, students, kipling, was, enthusiastic, in, his, response, and, shortly, produced, both, formally, titled, the, ritual, of, the, calling, of, an, engineer, today, engineering, graduates, all, across, canada, are, presented, with, an, iron, ring, at, a, ceremony, to, remind, them, of, their, obligation, to, society, in, 1922, kipling, became, lord, rector, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, scotland, a, three, year, position, kipling, as, a, francophile, argued, strongly, for, an, anglo, french, alliance, to, uphold, the, peace, calling, britain, and, france, in, 1920, the, twin, fortresses, of, european, civilization, similarly, kipling, repeatedly, warned, against, revising, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, germany, s, favour, which, he, predicted, would, lead, to, a, new, world, war, an, admirer, of, raymond, poincar, kipling, was, one, of, few, british, intellectuals, who, supported, the, french, occupation, of, the, ruhr, in, 1923, at, a, time, when, the, british, government, and, most, public, opinion, was, against, the, french, position, in, contrast, to, the, popular, british, view, of, poincar, as, a, cruel, bully, intent, on, impoverishing, germany, with, unreasonable, reparations, kipling, argued, that, he, was, rightfully, trying, to, preserve, france, as, a, great, power, in, the, face, of, an, unfavourable, situation, kipling, argued, that, even, before, 1914, germany, s, larger, economy, and, higher, birth, rate, had, made, that, country, stronger, than, france, with, much, of, france, devastated, by, war, and, the, french, suffering, heavy, losses, meant, that, its, low, birth, rate, would, give, it, trouble, while, germany, was, mostly, undamaged, and, still, with, a, higher, birth, rate, so, he, reasoned, that, the, future, would, bring, german, domination, if, versailles, were, revised, in, germany, s, favour, and, it, was, madness, for, britain, to, press, france, to, do, so, in, 1924, kipling, was, opposed, to, the, labour, government, of, ramsay, macdonald, as, bolshevism, without, bullets, he, believed, that, labour, was, a, communist, front, organisation, and, excited, orders, and, instructions, from, moscow, would, expose, labour, as, such, to, the, british, people, kipling, s, views, were, on, the, right, though, he, admired, benito, mussolini, to, some, extent, in, the, 1920s, he, was, against, fascism, calling, oswald, mosley, a, bounder, and, an, arriviste, by, 1935, he, was, calling, mussolini, a, deranged, and, dangerous, egomaniac, and, in, 1933, wrote, the, hitlerites, are, out, for, blood, despite, his, anti, communism, kipling, was, popular, with, russian, readers, in, the, interwar, period, many, younger, russian, poets, and, writers, such, as, konstantin, simonov, were, influenced, by, him, kipling, s, clarity, of, style, use, of, colloquial, language, and, employment, of, rhythm, and, rhyme, were, seen, as, major, innovations, in, poetry, that, appealed, to, many, younger, russian, poets, though, it, was, obligatory, for, soviet, journals, to, begin, translations, of, kipling, with, an, attack, on, him, as, a, fascist, and, an, imperialist, such, was, kipling, s, popularity, with, russian, readers, that, his, works, were, not, banned, in, the, soviet, union, until, 1939, with, the, signing, of, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, the, ban, was, lifted, in, 1941, after, operation, barbarossa, when, britain, become, a, soviet, ally, but, imposed, again, with, the, cold, war, in, 1946, many, older, editions, of, rudyard, kipling, s, books, have, a, swastika, printed, on, the, cover, associated, with, a, picture, of, an, elephant, carrying, a, lotus, flower, reflecting, the, influence, of, indian, culture, kipling, s, use, of, the, swastika, was, based, on, the, indian, sun, symbol, conferring, good, luck, and, the, sanskrit, word, meaning, fortunate, or, well, being, he, used, the, swastika, symbol, in, both, right, and, left, facing, forms, and, it, was, in, general, use, by, others, at, the, time, in, a, note, to, edward, bok, after, the, death, of, lockwood, kipling, in, 1911, rudyard, said, i, am, sending, with, this, for, your, acceptance, as, some, little, memory, of, my, father, to, whom, you, were, so, kind, the, original, of, one, of, the, plaques, that, he, used, to, make, for, me, i, thought, it, being, the, swastika, would, be, appropriate, for, your, swastika, may, it, bring, you, even, more, good, fortune, once, the, swastika, had, become, widely, associated, with, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazis, kipling, ordered, that, it, should, no, longer, adorn, his, books, less, than, a, year, before, his, death, kipling, gave, a, speech, titled, an, undefended, island, to, the, royal, society, of, st, george, on, 6, may, 1935, warning, of, the, danger, which, nazi, germany, posed, to, britain, kipling, scripted, the, first, royal, christmas, message, delivered, via, the, bbc, s, empire, service, by, george, v, in, 1932, in, 1934, he, published, a, short, story, in, the, strand, magazine, proofs, of, holy, writ, postulating, that, william, shakespeare, had, helped, to, polish, the, prose, of, the, king, james, bible, kipling, kept, writing, until, the, early, 1930s, but, at, a, slower, pace, and, with, less, success, than, before, on, the, night, of, 12, january, 1936, he, suffered, a, haemorrhage, in, his, small, intestine, he, underwent, surgery, but, died, at, middlesex, hospital, in, london, less, than, a, week, later, on, 18, january, 1936, at, the, age, of, 70, of, a, perforated, duodenal, ulcer, kipling, s, body, lay, in, state, in, the, fitzrovia, chapel, part, of, middlesex, hospital, after, his, death, and, is, commemorated, with, a, plaque, near, the, altar, his, death, had, previously, been, incorrectly, announced, in, a, magazine, to, which, he, wrote, i, ve, just, read, that, i, am, dead, don, t, forget, to, delete, me, from, your, list, of, subscribers, the, pallbearers, at, the, funeral, included, kipling, s, cousin, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, and, the, marble, casket, was, covered, by, a, union, jack, kipling, was, cremated, at, golders, green, crematorium, in, north, west, london, and, his, ashes, interred, at, poets, corner, part, of, the, south, transept, of, westminster, abbey, next, to, the, graves, of, charles, dickens, and, thomas, hardy, kipling, s, will, was, proven, on, 6, april, with, his, estate, valued, at, 168, 141, 2s, 11d, roughly, equivalent, to, 14, 430, 543, in, 2023, in, 2002, kipling, s, just, so, stories, featured, on, a, series, of, uk, postage, stamps, issued, by, the, royal, mail, to, mark, the, centenary, of, the, publication, of, the, book, in, 2010, the, international, astronomical, union, approved, the, naming, of, a, crater, on, the, planet, mercury, after, kipling, one, of, ten, newly, discovered, impact, craters, observed, by, the, messenger, spacecraft, in, 2008, 2009, in, 2012, an, extinct, species, of, crocodile, goniopholis, kiplingi, was, named, in, his, honour, in, recognition, for, his, enthusiasm, for, natural, sciences, more, than, 50, unpublished, poems, by, kipling, discovered, by, the, american, scholar, thomas, pinney, were, released, for, the, first, time, in, march, 2013, kipling, s, writing, has, strongly, influenced, that, of, others, his, stories, for, adults, remain, in, print, and, have, garnered, high, praise, from, writers, as, different, as, poul, anderson, jorge, luis, borges, and, randall, jarrell, who, wrote, after, you, have, read, kipling, s, fifty, or, seventy, five, best, stories, you, realize, that, few, men, have, written, this, many, stories, of, this, much, merit, and, that, very, few, have, written, more, and, better, stories, his, children, s, stories, remain, popular, and, his, jungle, books, made, into, several, films, the, first, was, made, by, producer, alexander, korda, other, films, have, been, produced, by, the, walt, disney, company, a, number, of, his, poems, were, set, to, music, by, percy, grainger, a, series, of, short, films, based, on, some, of, his, stories, was, broadcast, by, the, bbc, in, 1964, kipling, s, work, is, still, popular, today, the, poet, t, s, eliot, edited, a, choice, of, kipling, s, verse, 1941, with, an, introductory, essay, eliot, was, aware, of, the, complaints, that, had, been, levelled, against, kipling, and, he, dismissed, them, one, by, one, that, kipling, is, a, tory, using, his, verse, to, transmit, right, wing, political, views, or, a, journalist, pandering, to, popular, taste, while, eliot, writes, i, cannot, find, any, justification, for, the, charge, that, he, held, a, doctrine, of, race, superiority, eliot, finds, instead, an, immense, gift, for, using, words, an, amazing, curiosity, and, power, of, observation, with, his, mind, and, with, all, his, senses, the, mask, of, the, entertainer, and, beyond, that, a, queer, gift, of, second, sight, of, transmitting, messages, from, elsewhere, a, gift, so, disconcerting, when, we, are, made, aware, of, it, that, thenceforth, we, are, never, sure, when, it, is, not, present, all, this, makes, kipling, a, writer, impossible, wholly, to, understand, and, quite, impossible, to, belittle, of, kipling, s, verse, such, as, his, barrack, room, ballads, eliot, writes, of, a, number, of, poets, who, have, written, great, poetry, only, a, very, few, whom, i, should, call, great, verse, writers, and, unless, i, am, mistaken, kipling, s, position, in, this, class, is, not, only, high, but, unique, in, response, to, eliot, george, orwell, wrote, a, long, consideration, of, kipling, s, work, for, horizon, in, 1942, noting, that, although, as, a, jingo, imperialist, kipling, was, morally, insensitive, and, aesthetically, disgusting, his, work, had, many, qualities, which, ensured, that, while, every, enlightened, person, has, despised, him, nine, tenths, of, those, enlightened, persons, are, forgotten, and, kipling, is, in, some, sense, still, there, one, reason, for, kipling, s, power, his, sense, of, responsibility, which, made, it, possible, for, him, to, have, a, world, view, even, though, it, happened, to, be, a, false, one, although, he, had, no, direct, connexion, with, any, political, party, kipling, was, a, conservative, a, thing, that, does, not, exist, nowadays, those, who, now, call, themselves, conservatives, are, either, liberals, fascists, or, the, accomplices, of, fascists, he, identified, himself, with, the, ruling, power, and, not, with, the, opposition, in, a, gifted, writer, this, seems, to, us, strange, and, even, disgusting, but, it, did, have, the, advantage, of, giving, kipling, a, certain, grip, on, reality, the, ruling, power, is, always, faced, with, the, question, in, such, and, such, circumstances, what, would, you, do, whereas, the, opposition, is, not, obliged, to, take, responsibility, or, make, any, real, decisions, where, it, is, a, permanent, and, pensioned, opposition, as, in, england, the, quality, of, its, thought, deteriorates, accordingly, moreover, anyone, who, starts, out, with, a, pessimistic, reactionary, view, of, life, tends, to, be, justified, by, events, for, utopia, never, arrives, and, the, gods, of, the, copybook, headings, as, kipling, put, it, always, return, kipling, sold, out, to, the, british, governing, class, not, financially, but, emotionally, this, warped, his, political, judgement, for, the, british, ruling, class, were, not, what, he, imagined, and, it, led, him, into, abysses, of, folly, and, snobbery, but, he, gained, a, corresponding, advantage, from, having, at, least, tried, to, imagine, what, action, and, responsibility, are, like, it, is, a, great, thing, in, his, favour, that, he, is, not, witty, not, daring, has, no, wish, to, pater, les, bourgeois, he, dealt, largely, in, platitudes, and, since, we, live, in, a, world, of, platitudes, much, of, what, he, said, sticks, even, his, worst, follies, seem, less, shallow, and, less, irritating, than, the, enlightened, utterances, of, the, same, period, such, as, wilde, s, epigrams, or, the, collection, of, cracker, mottoes, at, the, end, of, man, and, superman, in, 1939, the, poet, w, h, auden, celebrated, kipling, in, a, similarly, ambiguous, way, in, his, elegy, for, william, butler, yeats, auden, deleted, this, section, from, more, recent, editions, of, his, poems, time, that, is, intolerant, of, the, brave, and, innocent, and, indifferent, in, a, week, to, a, beautiful, physique, worships, language, and, forgives, everyone, by, whom, it, lives, pardons, cowardice, conceit, lays, its, honours, at, his, feet, time, that, with, this, strange, excuse, pardoned, kipling, and, his, views, and, will, pardon, paul, claudel, pardons, him, for, writing, well, the, poet, alison, brackenbury, writes, kipling, is, poetry, s, dickens, an, outsider, and, journalist, with, an, unrivalled, ear, for, sound, and, speech, the, english, folk, singer, peter, bellamy, was, a, lover, of, kipling, s, poetry, much, of, which, he, believed, to, have, been, influenced, by, english, traditional, folk, forms, he, recorded, several, albums, of, kipling, s, verse, set, to, traditional, airs, or, to, tunes, of, his, own, composition, written, in, traditional, style, however, in, the, case, of, the, bawdy, folk, song, the, bastard, king, of, england, which, is, commonly, credited, to, kipling, it, is, believed, that, the, song, is, actually, misattributed, kipling, often, is, quoted, in, discussions, of, contemporary, british, political, and, social, issues, in, 1911, kipling, wrote, the, poem, the, reeds, of, runnymede, that, celebrated, magna, carta, and, summoned, up, a, vision, of, the, stubborn, englishry, determined, to, defend, their, rights, in, 1996, the, following, verses, of, the, poem, were, quoted, by, former, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, warning, against, the, encroachment, of, the, european, union, on, national, sovereignty, at, runnymede, at, runnymede, oh, hear, the, reeds,

suchlike, things, rolls, deep, and, dreadful, as, he, brings, their, warning, down, from, runnymede, political, singer, songwriter, billy, bragg, who, attempts, to, build, a, left, wing, english, nationalism, in, contrast, with, the, more, common, right, wing, english, nationalism, has, attempted, to, reclaim, kipling, for, an, inclusive, sense, of, englishness, kipling, s, enduring, relevance, has, been, noted, in, the, united, states, as, it, has, become, involved, in, afghanistan, and, other, areas, about, which, he, wrote, in, 1903, kipling, gave, permission, to, elizabeth, ford, holt, to, borrow, themes, from, the, jungle, books, to, establish, camp, mowglis, a, summer, camp, for, boys, on, the, shores, of, newfound, lake, in, new, hampshire, throughout, their, lives, kipling, and, his, wife, carrie, maintained, an, active, interest, in, camp, mowglis, which, still, continues, the, traditions, that, kipling, inspired, buildings, at, mowglis, have, names, such, as, akela, toomai, baloo, and, panther, the, campers, are, referred, to, as, the, pack, from, the, youngest, cubs, to, the, oldest, living, in, den, kipling, s, links, with, the, scouting, movements,

of, his, material, kipling, s, reputation, remains, controversial, especially, among, modern, nationalists, and, some, post, colonial, critics, it, has, long, been, alleged, that, rudyard, kipling, was, a, prominent, supporter, of, colonel, reginald, dyer, who, was, responsible, for, the, jallianwala, bagh, massacre, in, amritsar, in, the, province, of, punjab, and, that, kipling, called, dyer,

london, says, that, while, kipling, did, make, a, 10, donation, he, never, made, that, remark, similarly, author, derek, sayer, states, that, dyer, was, widely, lauded, as, the, saviour, of, punjab, that, kipling, had, no, part, in, organizing, the, morning, post, fund, and, that, kipling, only, sent, 10, making, the, laconic, observation, he, did, his, duty, as, he, saw, it, subhash, chopra,

phrase, the, man, who, saved, india, along, with, the, dyer, benefit, fund, to, the, morning, post, as, well, many, contemporary, indian, intellectuals, such, as, ashis, nandy, have, a, nuanced, view, of, kipling, s, legacy, jawaharlal, nehru, the, first, prime, minister, of, independent, india, often, described, kipling, s, novel, kim, as, one, of, his, favourite, books, g, v, desani, an, indian,

an, ancient, indian, scripture, indian, writer, r, k, narayan, said, kipling, the, supposed, expert, writer, on, india, showed, a, better, understanding, of, the, mind, of, the, animals, in, the,
