before, he, was, born, so, there, was, a, seven, year, gap, between, him, and, his, next, older, brother, frank, so, he, and, his, two, younger, siblings, were, almost, like, a, separate, family, of, which, he, was, the, eldest, baden, powell, s, father, died, when, he, was, three, subsequently, baden, powell, was, raised, by, his, mother, a, strong, woman, who, was, determined, that, her,

scholarship, to, charterhouse, a, prestigious, public, school, named, after, the, ancient, carthusian, monastery, buildings, it, occupied, in, the, city, of, london, however, while, he, was, a, pupil, there, the, school, moved, out, to, new, purpose, built, premises, in, the, countryside, near, godalming, in, surrey, he, played, with, dolls, and, learnt, the, piano, and, violin, was, an, ambidextrous, artist, and, enjoyed, acting, holidays, were, spent, on, yachting, or, canoeing, expeditions, with, his, brothers, baden, powell, s, first, introduction, to, scouting, skills, was, through, stalking, and, cooking, games, while, avoiding, teachers, in, the, nearby, woods, which, were, strictly, out, of, bounds, in, 1876, baden, powell, joined, the, 13th, hussars, in, india, with, the, rank, of, lieutenant, in, 1880, he, was, charged, with, the, task, of, drawing, maps, of, the, battle, of, maiwand, he, enhanced, and, honed, his, military, scouting, skills, amidst, the, zulu, in, the, early, 1880s, in, the, natal, province, of, south, africa, where, his, regiment, had, been, posted, and, where, he, was, mentioned, in, dispatches, baden, powell, s, skills, impressed, his, superiors, and, in, 1890, he, was, brevetted, major, as, military, secretary, and, senior, aide, de, camp, to, the, commander, in, chief, and, governor, of, malta, his, uncle, general, sir, henry,

baden, powell, returned, to, africa, in, 1896, and, served, in, the, second, matabele, war, in, the, expedition, to, relieve, british, south, africa, company, personnel, under, siege, in, bulawayo, this, was, a, formative, experience, for, him, not, only, because, he, commanded, reconnaissance, missions, into, enemy, territory, in, the, matopos, hills, but, because, many, of, his, later, boy, scout, ideas, took, hold, here, it, was, during, this, campaign, that, he, first, met, and, befriended, the, american, scout, frederick, russell, burnham, who, introduced, baden, powell, to, stories, of, the, american, old, west, and, woodcraft, i, e, scoutcraft, and, here, that, he, was, introduced, to, montana, peaked, version, of, a, western, cowboy, hat, of, which, stetson, was, a, prolific, manufacturer, and, which, also, came, to, be, known, as, a, campaign, hat, and, the, many, versatile, and, practical, uses, of, a, neckerchief, baden, powell, was, accused, of, illegally, executing, a, prisoner, of, war, in, 1896, the, matabele, chief, uwini, who, had, been, promised, his, life, would, be, spared, if, he, surrendered, uwini, was, sentenced, to, be, shot, by, firing, squad, by, a, military, court, a, sentence, baden, powell, confirmed, baden, powell, was, cleared, by, a, military, court, of, inquiry, but, the, colonial, civil, authorities, wanted, a, civil, investigation, and, trial, baden, powell, later, claimed, he, was, released, without, a, stain, on, my, character, after, rhodesia, baden, powell, served, in, the, fourth, ashanti, war, on, the, gold, coast, in, 1897, at, the, age, of, 40, he, was, brevetted, colonel, the, youngest, colonel, in, the, british, army, and, given, command, of, the, 5th, dragoon, guards, in, india, a, few, years, later, he, wrote, a, small, manual, entitled, aids, to, scouting, a, summary, of, lectures, he, had, given, on, the, subject, of, military, scouting, much, of, it, a, written, explanation, of, the, lessons, he, had, learned, from, burnham, to, help, train, recruits, baden, powell, returned, to, south, africa, before, the, second, boer, war, although, instructed, to, maintain, a, mobile, mounted, force, on, the, frontier, with, the, boer, republics, baden, powell, amassed, stores, and, established, a, garrison, at, mafeking, the, subsequent, siege, of, mafeking, lasted, 217, days, although, baden, powell, could, have, destroyed, his, stores, and, had, sufficient, forces, to, break, out, throughout, much, of, the, siege, especially, since, the, boers, lacked, adequate, artillery, to, shell, the, town, or, its, forces, he, remained, in, the, town, to, the, point, of, his, intended, mounted, soldiers, eating, their, horses, the, town, had, been, surrounded, by, a, boer, army, at, times, above, 8, 000, men, the, siege, of, the, small, town, received, much, attention, from, both, the, boers, and, international, media, because, lord, edward, cecil, the, son, of, the, british, prime, minister, was, besieged, in, the, town, the, garrison, held, out, until, relieved, in, part, thanks, to, cunning, deceptions, many, devised, by, baden, powell, fake, minefields, were, planted, and, his, soldiers, pretended, to, avoid, non, existent, barbed, wire, while, moving, between, trenches, baden, powell, did, much, reconnaissance, work, himself, in, one, instance, noting, that, the, boers, had, not, removed, the, rail, line, baden, powell, loaded, an, armoured, locomotive, with, sharpshooters, and, sent, it, down, the, rails, into, the, heart, of, the, boer, encampment, and, back, again, in, a, successful, attack, a, view, expressed, by, historian, thomas, pakenham, of, baden, powell, s, actions, during, the, siege, argued, that, his, success, in, resisting, the, boers, was, secured, at, the, expense, of, the, lives, of, the, native, african, soldiers, and, civilians, including, members, of, his, own, african, garrison, pakenham, claimed, that, baden, powell, drastically, reduced, the, rations, to, the, native, garrison, however, in, 2001, after, subsequent, research, pakenham, changed, this, view, during, the, siege, the, mafeking, cadet, corps, of, white, boys, below, fighting, age, stood, guard, carried, messages, assisted, in, hospitals, and, so, on, freeing, grown, men, to, fight, baden, powell, did, not, form, the, cadet, corps, himself, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, took, much, notice, of, them, during, the, siege, however, he, was, sufficiently, impressed, with, both, their, courage, and, the, equanimity, with, which, they, performed, their, tasks, to, use, them, later, as, an, object, lesson, in, the, first, chapter, of, scouting, for, boys, the, siege, was, lifted, on, 17, may, 1900, baden, powell, was, promoted, to, major, general, and, became, a, national, hero, however, british, military, commanders, were, more, critical, of, his, performance, and, even, less, impressed, with, his, subsequent, choices, to, again, allow, himself, to, be, besieged, ultimately, his, failure, to, understand, properly, the, situation, and, abandonment, of, the, soldiers, mostly, australians, and, rhodesians, at, the, battle, of, elands, river, pakenham, claimed, led, to, his, being, removed, from, action, briefly, back, in, the, united, kingdom, in, october, 1901, baden, powell, was, invited, to, visit, king, edward, vii, at, balmoral, the, monarch, s, scottish, retreat, and, personally, invested, as, companion, of, the, order, of, the, bath, cb, baden, powell, was, given, the, role, of, organising, the, south, african, constabulary, a, colonial, police, force, but, during, this, phase, baden, powell, was, sent, to, britain, on, sick, leave, so, he, was, only, in, command, for, seven, months, baden, powell, returned, to, england, to, take, up, the, post, of, inspector, general, of, cavalry, in, 1903, while, holding, this, position, he, was, instrumental, in, reforming, reconnaissance, training, in, british, cavalry, giving, the, force, an, important, advantage, in, scouting, ability, over, continental, rivals, also, during, this, appointment, baden, powell, selected, the, location, of, catterick, garrison, to, replace, richmond, castle, which, was, then, the, headquarters, of, the, northumbrian, division, baden, powell, was, a, career, cavalryman, but, realised, that, cavalry, was, no, match, against, the, machine, gun, however, his, superiors, kitchener, and, french, the, latter, also, a, career, cavalryman, still, regarded, the, cavalry, as, indispensable, with, the, result, that, cavalry, was, used, in, the, first, world, war, with, little, effect, yet, the, major, item, exported, from, britain, to, flanders, during, the, war, was, horse, fodder, in, 1907, baden, powell, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, general, but, was, on, the, inactive, list, possibly, at, his, request, for, this, was, when, the, scout, movement, was, starting, to, move, and, baden, powell, had, his, experimental, camp, on, brownsea, island, see, below, in, october, 1907, baden, powell, was, appointed, to, the, command, of, the, northumbrian, division, of, the, newly, formed, territorial, army, his, headquarters, were, in, richmond, castle, he, chose, the, site, for, the, catterick, military, town, on, 19, february, 1909, baden, powell, sailed, in, the, ss, aragon, via, portugal, and, spain, to, south, america, for, what, seems, to, have, been, just, a, holiday, a, trip, not, related, to, either, the, army, or, to, scouting, however, the, foreign, intelligence, section, in, the, belfast, newsletter, reported, that, when, in, march, 1909, he, visited, santiago, de, chile, for, three, days, he, was, given, a, warmer, reception, than, had, ever, been, afforded, a, foreigner, in, south, america, he, sailed, back, in, the, rms, danube, by, 1, may, 1909, in, 1910, aged, 53, baden, powell, retired, from, the, army, one, account, has, it, that, lord, kitchener, said, that, he, could, lay, his, hand, on, several, competent, divisional, generals, but, could, find, no, one, who, could, carry, on, the, invaluable, work, of, the, boy, scouts, baden, powell, wrote, that, this, came, from, the, king, which, seems, more, likely, as, the, king, had, introduced, the, king, s, scout, award, in, 1909, and, army, officers, held, a, commission, signed, by, the, king, while, kitchener, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, scout, movement, in, 1915, baden, powell, s, book, my, adventures, as, a, spy, was, published, which, was, interpreted, as, indicating, that, he, had, been, active, as, a, spy, during, that, war, pronunciation, of, baden, powell, b, e, d, n, p, o, l, bay, d, n, poh, l, man, matron, maiden, please, call, it, baden, further, for, powell, rhyme, it, with, noel, verse, by, b, p, on, his, return, from, africa, in, 1903, baden, powell, found, that, his, military, training, manual, aids, to, scouting, had, become, a, best, seller, and, was, being, used, by, teachers, and, youth, organisations, including, charlotte, mason, s, house, of, education, following, his, involvement, in, the, boys, brigade, as, a, brigade, vice, president, and, officer, in, charge, of, its, scouting, section, with, encouragement, from, his, friend, william, alexander, smith, baden, powell, decided, to, re, write, aids, to, scouting, to, suit, a, youth, readership, in, august, 1907, he, held, a, camp, on, brownsea, island, to, test, out, his, ideas, about, twenty, boys, attended, eight, from, local, boys, brigade, companies, and, about, twelve, public, school, boys, mostly, sons, of, his, friends, baden, powell, was, also, influenced, by, ernest, thompson, seton, who, founded, the, woodcraft, indians, seton, gave, baden, powell, a, copy, of, his, book, the, birch, bark, roll, of, the, woodcraft, indians, and, they, met, in, 1906, the, first, book, on, the, scout, movement, baden, powell, s, scouting, for, boys, was, published, in, six, installments, in, 1908, and, has, sold, approximately, 150, million, copies, as, the, fourth, best, selling, book, of, the, 20th, century, boys, and, girls, spontaneously, formed, scout, troops, and, the, scouting, movement, started, by, itself, first, as, a, national, and, soon, an, international, phenomenon, a, rally, of, scouts, was, held, at, crystal, palace, in, london, in, 1909, at, which, baden, powell, met, some, of, the, first, girl, scouts, of, whom, 6, 000, had, already, been, officially, registered, as, scouts, the, girl, guides, were, subsequently, formed, in, 1910, under, the, auspices, of, baden, powell, s, sister, agnes, baden, powell, in, 1912, baden, powell, started, a, world, tour, with, a, voyage, to, the, caribbean, another, passenger, was, juliette, gordon, low, an, american, who, had, been, running, a, guide, company, in, scotland, and, was, returning, to, the, u, s, a, baden, powell, encouraged, her, to, found, the, girl, scouts, of, the, usa, in, 1929, during, the, 3rd, world, scout, jamboree, he, received, as, a, present, a, new, 20, horsepower, rolls, royce, car, chassis, number, gvo, 40, registration, ou, 2938, and, an, eccles, caravan, this, combination, well, served, the, baden, powells, in, their, further, travels, around, europe, the, caravan, was, nicknamed, eccles, and, is, now, on, display, at, gilwell, park, the, car, nicknamed, jam, roll, was, sold, after, his, death, by, olave, baden, powell, in, 1945, jam, roll, and, eccles, were, reunited, at, gilwell, for, the, 21st, world, scout, jamboree, in, 2007, it, has, been, purchased, on, behalf, of, scouting, and, is, owned, by, a, charity, b, p, jam, roll, ltd, funds, are, being, raised, to, repay, the, loan, that, was, used, to, purchase, the, car, baden, powell, also, had, a, positive, impact, on, improvements, in, youth, education, under, his, dedicated, command, the, world, scouting, movement, grew, by, 1922, there, were, more, than, a, million, scouts, in, 32, countries, by, 1939, the, number, of, scouts, was, over, 3, 3, million, some, early, scouting, thanks, badges, from, 1911, and, the, scouting, medal, of, merit, badge, had, a, swastika, symbol, on, them, this, was, undoubtedly, influenced, by, the, use, by, rudyard, kipling, of, the, swastika, on, the, jacket, of, his, published, books, including, the, jungle, book, which, was, used, by, baden, powell, as, a, basis, for, the, wolf, cub, branch, of, the, scouting, movement, the, swastika, had, been, a, symbol, of, luck, in, india, long, before, being, adopted, by, the, nazi, party, in, 1920, and, when, nazi, use, of, the, swastika, became, more, widespread, the, scouts, stopped, using, it, nazi, germany, banned, scouting, a, competitor, to, the, hitler, youth, in, june, 1934, seeing, it, as, a, haven, for, young, men, opposed, to, the, new, state, based, on, the, regime, s, view, of, scouting, as, a, dangerous, espionage, organisation, baden, powell, s, name, was, included, in, the, black, book, a, 1940, secret, list, of, people, to, be, detained, following, the, planned, conquest, of, the, united, kingdom, baden, powell, never, knew, about, the, list, or, his, inclusion, in, it, because, the, list, was, only, made, public, in, 1945, shortly, after, the, defeat, of, the, nazis, and, baden, powell, died, in, 1941, a, drawing, by, baden, powell, depicts, scouts, assisting, refugees, fleeing, from, the, nazis, and, hitler, tim, jeal, the, author, of, the, biography, baden, powell, gives, his, opinion, that, baden, powell, s, distrust, of, communism, led, to, his, implicit, support, through, na, vet, of, fascism, an, opinion, based, on, two, of, b, p, s, diary, entries, baden, powell, met, benito, mussolini, on, 2, march, 1933, and, in, his, diary, described, him, as, small, stout, human, and, genial, told, me, about, balilla, and, workmen, s, outdoor, recreations, which, he, imposed, through, moral, force, on, 17, october, 1939, baden, powell, wrote, in, his, diary, lay, up, all, day, read, mein, kampf, a, wonderful, book, with, good, ideas, on, education, health, propaganda, organisation, etc, and, ideals, which, hitler, does, not, practice, himself, at, the, 5th, world, scout, jamboree, in, 1937, baden, powell, gave, his, farewell, to, scouting, and, retired, from, public, scouting, life, 22, february, the, joint, birthday, of, robert, and, olave, baden, powell, continues, to, be, marked, as, founder, s, day, by, scouts, and, world, thinking, day, by, guides, to, remember, and, celebrate, the, work, of, the, chief, scout, and, chief, guide, of, the, world, in, his, final, letter, to, the, scouts, baden, powell, wrote, i, have, had, a, most, happy, life, and, i, want, each, one, of, you, to, have, a, happy, life, too, i, believe, that, god, put, us, in, this, jolly, world, to, be, happy, and, enjoy, life, happiness, does, not, come, from, being, rich, nor, merely, being, successful, in, your, career, nor, by, self, indulgence, one, step, towards, happiness, is, to, make, yourself, healthy, and, strong, while, you, are, a, boy, so, that, you, can, be, useful, and, so, you, can, enjoy, life, when, you, are, a, man, nature, study, will, show, you, how, full, of, beautiful, and, wonderful, things, god, has, made, the, world, for, you, to, enjoy, be, contented, with, what, you, have, got, and, make, the, best, of, it, look, on, the, bright, side, of, things, instead, of, the, gloomy, one, but, the, real, way, to, get, happiness, is, by, giving, out, happiness, to, other, people, try, and, leave, this, world, a, little, better, than, you, found, it, and, when, your, turn, comes, to, die, you, can, die, happy, in, feeling, that, at, any, rate, you, have, not, wasted, your, time, but, have, done, your, best, be, prepared, in, this, way, to, live, happy, and, to, die, happy, stick, to, your, scout, promise, always, even, after, you, have, ceased, to, be, a, boy, and, god, help, you, to, do, it, baden,

beside, her, husband, in, 2001, the, kenyan, government, declared, baden, powell, s, grave, a, national, monument, baden, powell, published, books, and, other, texts, during, his, years, of, military, service, both, to, finance, his, life, and, to, generally, educate, his, men, baden, powell, was, regarded, as, an, excellent, storyteller, during, his, whole, life, he, told, ripping, yarns, to, audiences, after, having, published, scouting, for, boys, baden, powell, kept, on, writing, more, handbooks, and, educative, materials, for, all, scouts, as, well, as, directives, for, scout, leaders, in, his, later, years, he, also, wrote, about, the, scout, movement, and, his, ideas, for, its, future, he, spent, most, of, the, last, two, years, of, his, life, in, africa, and, many, of, his, later, books, had, african, themes, most, of, his, books, the, american, editions, are, available, online, compilations, and, excerpts, comprised, baden, powell, also, contributed, to, various, other, books, either, with, an, introduction, or, foreword, or, being, quoted, by, the, author, a, comprehensive, bibliography, of, his, original, works, has, been, published, by, biblioteca, frati, minori,

almost, every, day, of, his, life, and, with, equal, competence, with, either, hand, most, of, his, works, have, a, humorous, or, informative, character, his, books, are, scattered, with, his, pen,
