alexander, grothendieck, later, alexandre, grothendieck, in, french, r, o, t, n, d, i, k, german, french, 28, march, 1928, 13, november, 2014, was, a, german, born, french, mathematician, who, became, the, leading, figure, in, the, creation, of, modern, algebraic, geometry, his, research, extended, the, scope, of, the, field, and, added, elements, of, commutative, algebra, homological, algebra, sheaf, theory, and, category, theory, to, its, foundations, while, his, so, called, relative, perspective, led, to, revolutionary, advances, in, many, areas, of, pure, mathematics, he, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, greatest, mathematician, of, the, twentieth, century, grothendieck, began, his, productive, and, public, career, as, a, mathematician, in, 1949, in, 1958, he, was, appointed, a, research, professor, at, the, institut, des, hautes, tudes, scientifiques, ih, s, and, remained, there, until, 1970, when, driven, by, personal, and, political, convictions, he, left, following, a, dispute, over, military, funding, he, received, the, fields, medal, in, 1966, for, advances, in, algebraic, geometry, homological, algebra, and, k, theory, he, later, became, professor, at, the, university, of, montpellier, and, while, still, producing, relevant, mathematical, work, he, withdrew, from, the, mathematical, community, and, devoted, himself, to, political, and, religious, pursuits, first, buddhism, and, later, a, more, catholic, christian, vision, in, 1991, he, moved, to, the, french, village, of, lasserre, in, the, pyrenees, where, he, lived, in, seclusion, still, working, on, mathematics, and, his, philosophical, and, religious, thoughts, until, his, death, in, 2014, grothendieck, was, born, in, berlin, to, anarchist, parents, his, father, alexander, sascha, schapiro, also, known, as, alexander, tanaroff, had, hasidic, jewish, roots, and, had, been, imprisoned, in, russia, before, moving, to, germany, in, 1922, while, his, mother, johanna, hanka, grothendieck, came, from, a, protestant, german, family, in, hamburg, and, worked, as, a, journalist, as, teenagers, both, of, his, parents, had, broken, away, from, their, early, backgrounds, at, the, time, of, his, birth, grothendieck, s, mother, was, married, to, the, journalist, johannes, raddatz, and, initially, his, birth, name, was, recorded, as, alexander, raddatz, that, marriage, was, dissolved, in, 1929, and, schapiro, acknowledged, his, paternity, but, never, married, hanka, grothendieck, grothendieck, had, a, maternal, sibling, his, half, sister, maidi, grothendieck, lived, with, his, parents, in, berlin, until, the, end, of, 1933, when, his, father, moved, to, paris, to, evade, nazism, his, mother, followed, soon, thereafter, grothendieck, was, left, in, the, care, of, wilhelm, heydorn, a, lutheran, pastor, and, teacher, in, hamburg, according, to, winfried, scharlau, during, this, time, his, parents, took, part, in, the, spanish, civil, war, as, non, combatant, auxiliaries, however, others, state, that, schapiro, fought, in, the, anarchist, militia, in, may, 1939, grothendieck, was, put, on, a, train, in, hamburg, for, france, shortly, afterward, his, father, was, interned, in, le, vernet, he, and, his, mother, were, then, interned, in, various, camps, from, 1940, to, 1942, as, undesirable, dangerous, foreigners, the, first, camp, was, the, rieucros, camp, where, his, mother, contracted, the, tuberculosis, that, would, eventually, cause, her, death, in, 1957, while, there, grothendieck, managed, to, attend, the, local, school, at, mendel, once, he, managed, to, escape, from, the, camp, intending, to, assassinate, hitler, later, his, mother, hanka, was, transferred, to, the, gurs, internment, camp, for, the, remainder, of, world, war, ii, grothendieck, was, permitted, to, live, separated, from, his, mother, in, the, village, of, le, chambon, sur, lignon, he, was, sheltered, and, hidden, in, local, boarding, houses, or, pensions, although, he, occasionally, had, to, seek, refuge, in, the, woods, during, nazi, raids, surviving, at, times, without, food, or, water, for, several, days, his, father, was, arrested, under, the, vichy, anti, jewish, legislation, and, sent, to, the, drancy, internment, camp, and, then, handed, over, by, the, french, vichy, government, to, the, germans, to, be, sent, to, be, murdered, at, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, in, 1942, in, le, chambon, grothendieck, attended, the, coll, ge, c, venol, now, known, as, the, le, coll, ge, lyc, e, c, venol, international, a, unique, secondary, school, founded, in, 1938, by, local, protestant, pacifists, and, anti, war, activists, many, of, the, refugee, children, hidden, in, le, chambon, attended, coll, ge, c, venol, and, it, was, at, this, school, that, grothendieck, apparently, first, became, fascinated, with, mathematics, in, 1990, for, risking, their, lives, to, rescue, jews, the, entire, village, was, recognized, as, righteous, among, the, nations, after, the, war, the, young, grothendieck, studied, mathematics, in, france, initially, at, the, university, of, montpellier, where, at, first, he, did, not, perform, well, failing, such, classes, as, astronomy, working, on, his, own, he, rediscovered, the, lebesgue, measure, after, three, years, of, increasingly, independent, studies, there, he, went, to, continue, his, studies, in, paris, in, 1948, initially, grothendieck, attended, henri, cartan, s, seminar, at, cole, normale, sup, rieure, but, he, lacked, the, necessary, background, to, follow, the, high, powered, seminar, on, the, advice, of, cartan, and, andr, weil, he, moved, to, the, university, of, nancy, where, two, leading, experts, were, working, on, grothendieck, s, area, of, interest, topological, vector, spaces, jean, dieudonn, and, laurent, schwartz, the, latter, had, recently, won, a, fields, medal, he, showed, his, new, student, his, latest, paper, it, ended, with, a, list, of, 14, open, questions, relevant, for, locally, convex, spaces, grothendieck, introduced, new, mathematical, methods, that, enabled, him, to, solve, all, of, these, problems, within, a, few, months, in, nancy, he, wrote, his, dissertation, under, those, two, professors, on, functional, analysis, from, 1950, to, 1953, at, this, time, he, was, a, leading, expert, in, the, theory, of, topological, vector, spaces, in, 1953, he, moved, to, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, in, brazil, where, he, immigrated, by, means, of, a, nansen, passport, given, that, he, had, refused, to, take, french, nationality, as, that, would, have, entailed, military, service, against, his, convictions, he, stayed, in, s, o, paulo, apart, from, a, lengthy, visit, in, france, from, october, 1953, march, 1954, until, the, end, of, 1954, his, published, work, from, the, time, spent, in, brazil, is, still, in, the, theory, of, topological, vector, spaces, it, is, there, that, he, completed, his, last, major, work, on, that, topic, on, metric, theory, of, banach, spaces, grothendieck, moved, to, lawrence, kansas, at, the, beginning, of, 1955, and, there, he, set, his, old, subject, aside, in, order, to, work, in, algebraic, topology, and, homological, algebra, and, increasingly, in, algebraic, geometry, it, was, in, lawrence, that, grothendieck, developed, his, theory, of, abelian, categories, and, the, reformulation, of, sheaf, cohomology, based, on, them, leading, to, the, very, influential, t, hoku, paper, in, 1957, he, was, invited, to, visit, harvard, university, by, oscar, zariski, but, the, offer, fell, through, when, he, refused, to, sign, a, pledge, promising, not, to, work, to, overthrow, the, united, states, government, a, refusal, which, he, was, warned, threatened, to, land, him, in, prison, the, prospect, of, prison, did, not, worry, him, so, long, as, he, could, have, access, to, books, comparing, grothendieck, during, his, nancy, years, to, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, trained, students, at, that, time, pierre, samuel, roger, godement, ren, thom, jacques, dixmier, jean, cerf, yvonne, bruhat, jean, pierre, serre, and, bernard, malgrange, leila, schneps, said, he, was, so, completely, unknown, to, this, group, and, to, their, professors, came, from, such, a, deprived, and, chaotic, background, and, was, compared, to, them, so, ignorant, at, the, start, of, his, research, career, that, his, fulgurating, ascent, to, sudden, stardom, is, all, the, more, incredible, quite, unique, in, the, history, of, mathematics, his, first, works, on, topological, vector, spaces, in, 1953, have, been, successfully, applied, to, physics, and, computer, science, culminating, in, a, relation, between, grothendieck, inequality, and, the, einstein, podolsky, rosen, paradox, in, quantum, physics, in, 1958, grothendieck, was, installed, at, the, institut, des, hautes, tudes, scientifiques, ih, s, a, new, privately, funded, research, institute, that, in, effect, had, been, created, for, jean, dieudonn, and, grothendieck, grothendieck, attracted, attention, by, an, intense, and, highly, productive, activity, of, seminars, there, de, facto, working, groups, drafting, into, foundational, work, some, of, the, ablest, french, and, other, mathematicians, of, the, younger, generation, grothendieck, practically, ceased, publication, of, papers, through, the, conventional, learned, journal, route, however, he, was, able, to, play, a, dominant, role, in, mathematics, for, approximately, a, decade, gathering, a, strong, school, officially, during, this, time, he, had, as, students, michel, demazure, who, worked, on, sga3, on, group, schemes, luc, illusie, cotangent, complex, michel, raynaud, jean, louis, verdier, co, founder, of, the, derived, category, theory, and, pierre, deligne, collaborators, on, the, sga, projects, also, included, michael, artin, tale, cohomology, nick, katz, monodromy, theory, and, lefschetz, pencils, jean, giraud, worked, out, torsor, theory, extensions, of, nonabelian, cohomology, there, as, well, many, others, such, as, david, mumford, robin, hartshorne, barry, mazur, and, c, p, ramanujam, were, also, involved, alexander, grothendieck, s, work, during, what, is, described, as, the, golden, age, period, at, the, ih, s, established, several, unifying, themes, in, algebraic, geometry, number, theory, topology, category, theory, and, complex, analysis, his, first, pre, ih, s, discovery, in, algebraic, geometry, was, the, grothendieck, hirzebruch, riemann, roch, theorem, a, generalisation, of, the, hirzebruch, riemann, roch, theorem, proved, algebraically, in, this, context, he, also, introduced, k, theory, then, following, the, programme, he, outlined, in, his, talk, at, the, 1958, international, congress, of, mathematicians, he, introduced, the, theory, of, schemes, developing, it, in, detail, in, his, l, ments, de, g, om, trie, alg, brique, ega, and, providing, the, new, more, flexible, and, general, foundations, for, algebraic, geometry, that, has, been, adopted, in, the, field, since, that, time, he, went, on, to, introduce, the, tale, cohomology, theory, of, schemes, providing, the, key, tools, for, proving, the, weil, conjectures, as, well, as, crystalline, cohomology, and, algebraic, de, rham, cohomology, to, complement, it, closely, linked, to, these, cohomology, theories, he, originated, topos, theory, as, a, generalisation, of, topology, relevant, also, in, categorical, logic, he, also, provided, by, means, of, a, categorical, galois, theory, an, algebraic, definition, of, fundamental, groups, of, schemes, giving, birth, to, the, now, famous, tale, fundamental, group, and, he, then, conjectured, the, existence, a, further, generalization, of, it, which, is, now, known, as, the, fundamental, group, scheme, as, a, framework, for, his, coherent, duality, theory, he, also, introduced, derived, categories, which, were, further, developed, by, verdier, the, results, of, his, work, on, these, and, other, topics, were, published, in, the, ega, and, in, less, polished, form, in, the, notes, of, the, s, minaire, de, g, om, trie, alg, brique, sga, that, he, directed, at, the, ih, s, grothendieck, s, political, views, were, radical, and, pacifistic, he, strongly, opposed, both, united, states, intervention, in, vietnam, and, soviet, military, expansionism, to, protest, against, the, vietnam, war, he, gave, lectures, on, category, theory, in, the, forests, surrounding, hanoi, while, the, city, was, being, bombed, in, 1966, he, had, declined, to, attend, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, icm, in, moscow, where, he, was, to, receive, the, fields, medal, he, retired, from, scientific, life, around, 1970, after, he, had, found, out, that, ih, s, was, partly, funded, by, the, military, he, returned, to, academia, a, few, years, later, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, montpellier, while, the, issue, of, military, funding, was, perhaps, the, most, obvious, explanation, for, grothendieck, s, departure, from, the, ih, s, those, who, knew, him, say, that, the, causes, of, the, rupture, ran, more, deeply, pierre, cartier, a, visiteur, de, longue, dur, e, long, term, guest, at, the, ih, s, wrote, a, piece, about, grothendieck, for, a, special, volume, published, on, the, occasion, of, the, ih, s, s, fortieth, anniversary, in, that, publication, cartier, notes, that, as, the, son, of, an, antimilitary, anarchist, and, one, who, grew, up, among, the, disenfranchised, grothendieck, always, had, a, deep, compassion, for, the, poor, and, the, downtrodden, as, cartier, puts, it, grothendieck, came, to, find, bures, sur, yvette, as, une, cage, dor, e, a, gilded, cage, while, grothendieck, was, at, the, ih, s, opposition, to, the, vietnam, war, was, heating, up, and, cartier, suggests, that, this, also, reinforced, grothendieck, s, distaste, at, having, become, a, mandarin, of, the, scientific, world, in, addition, after, several, years, at, the, ih, s, grothendieck, seemed, to, cast, about, for, new, intellectual, interests, by, the, late, 1960s, he, had, started, to, become, interested, in, scientific, areas, outside, mathematics, david, ruelle, a, physicist, who, joined, the, ih, s, faculty, in, 1964, said, that, grothendieck, came, to, talk, to, him, a, few, times, about, physics, biology, interested, grothendieck, much, more, than, physics, and, he, organized, some, seminars, on, biological, topics, in, 1970, grothendieck, with, two, other, mathematicians, claude, chevalley, and, pierre, samuel, created, a, political, group, entitled, survivre, the, name, later, changed, to, survivre, et, vivre, the, group, published, a, bulletin, and, was, dedicated, to, antimilitary, and, ecological, issues, it, also, developed, strong, criticism, of, the, indiscriminate, use, of, science, and, technology, grothendieck, devoted, the, next, three, years, to, this, group, and, served, as, the, main, editor, of, its, bulletin, although, grothendieck, continued, with, mathematical, enquiries, his, standard, mathematical, career, mostly, ended, when, he, left, the, ih, s, after, leaving, the, ih, s, grothendieck, became, a, temporary, professor, at, coll, ge, de, france, for, two, years, he, then, became, a, professor, at, the, university, of, montpellier, where, he, became, increasingly, estranged, from, the, mathematical, community, he, formally, retired, in, 1988, a, few, years, after, having, accepted, a, research, position, at, the, cnrs, while, not, publishing, mathematical, research, in, conventional, ways, during, the, 1980s, he, produced, several, influential, manuscripts, with, limited, distribution, with, both, mathematical, and, biographical, content, produced, during, 1980, and, 1981, la, longue, marche, travers, la, th, orie, de, galois, the, long, march, through, galois, theory, is, a, 1600, page, handwritten, manuscript, containing, many, of, the, ideas, that, led, to, the, esquisse, d, un, programme, it, also, includes, a, study, of, teichm, ller, theory, in, 1983, stimulated, by, correspondence, with, ronald, brown, and, tim, porter, at, bangor, university, grothendieck, wrote, a, 600, page, manuscript, entitled, pursuing, stacks, it, began, with, a, letter, addressed, to, daniel, quillen, this, letter, and, successive, parts, were, distributed, from, bangor, see, external, links, below, within, these, in, an, informal, diary, like, manner, grothendieck, explained, and, developed, his, ideas, on, the, relationship, between, algebraic, homotopy, theory, and, algebraic, geometry, and, prospects, for, a, noncommutative, theory, of, stacks, the, manuscript, which, is, being, edited, for, publication, by, g, maltsiniotis, later, led, to, another, of, his, monumental, works, les, d, rivateurs, written, in, 1991, this, latter, opus, of, approximately, 2000, pages, further, developed, the, homotopical, ideas, begun, in, pursuing, stacks, much, of, this, work, anticipated, the, subsequent, development, during, the, mid, 1990s, of, the, motivic, homotopy, theory, of, fabien, morel, and, vladimir, voevodsky, in, 1984, grothendieck, wrote, the, proposal, esquisse, d, un, programme, sketch, of, a, programme, for, a, position, at, the, centre, national, de, la, recherche, scientifique, cnrs, it, describes, new, ideas, for, studying, the, moduli, space, of, complex, curves, although, grothendieck, never, published, his, work, in, this, area, the, proposal, inspired, other, mathematicians, to, work, in, the, area, by, becoming, the, source, of, dessin, d, enfant, theory, and, anabelian, geometry, later, it, was, published, in, two, volumes, and, entitled, geometric, galois, actions, cambridge, university, press, 1997, during, this, period, grothendieck, also, gave, his, consent, to, publishing, some, of, his, drafts, for, ega, on, bertini, type, theorems, ega, v, published, in, ulam, quarterly, in, 1992, 1993, and, later, made, available, on, the, grothendieck, circle, web, site, in, 2004, in, the, 1, 000, page, autobiographical, manuscript, r, coltes, et, semailles, 1986, grothendieck, describes, his, approach, to, mathematics, and, his, experiences, in, the, mathematical, community, a, community, that, initially, accepted, him, in, an, open, and, welcoming, manner, but, which, he, progressively, perceived, to, be, governed, by, competition, and, status, he, complains, about, what, he, saw, as, the, burial, of, his, work, and, betrayal, by, his, former, students, and, colleagues, after, he, had, left, the, community, the, r, coltes, et, semailles, work, is, now, available, on, the, internet, in, the, french, original, and, an, english, translation, is, underway, a, japanese, translation, of, the, whole, book, in, four, volumes, was, completed, by, tsuji, yuichi, 1938, 2002, a, friend, of, grothendieck, from, the, survivre, period, the, first, three, volumes, corresponding, to, parts, 0, to, iii, of, the, book, were, published, between, 1989, and, 1993, while, the, fourth, volume, part, iv, was, completed, and, although, unpublished, copies, of, it, as, a, typed, manuscript, are, circulated, grothendieck, helped, with, the, translation, and, wrote, a, preface, for, it, in, which, he, called, tsuji, his, first, true, collaborator, parts, of, r, coltes, et, semailles, have, been, translated, into, spanish, as, well, as, into, a, russian, translation, that, was, published, in, moscow, the, french, original, was, finally, published, in, two, volumes, in, january, 2022, with, additional, texts, by, people, of, various, professions, who, discuss, certain, aspects, of, the, book, in, 1988, grothendieck, declined, the, crafoord, prize, with, an, open, letter, to, the, media, he, wrote, that, he, and, other, established, mathematicians, had, no, need, for, additional, financial, support, and, criticized, what, he, saw, as, the, declining, ethics, of, the, scientific, community, that, was, characterized, by, outright, scientific, theft, that, he, believed, had, become, commonplace, and, tolerated, the, letter, also, expressed, his, belief, that, totally, unforeseen, events, before, the, end, of, the, century, would, lead, to, an, unprecedented, collapse, of, civilization, grothendieck, added, however, that, his, views, were, in, no, way, meant, as, a, criticism, of, the, royal, academy, s, aims, in, the, administration, of, its, funds, and, he, added, i, regret, the, inconvenience, that, my, refusal, to, accept, the, crafoord, prize, may, have, caused, you, and, the, royal, academy, la, clef, des, songes, a, 315, page, manuscript, written, in, 1987, is, grothendieck, s, account, of, how, his, consideration, of, the, source, of, dreams, led, him, to, conclude, that, a, deity, exists, as, part, of, the, notes, to, this, manuscript, grothendieck, described, the, life, and, the, work, of, 18, mutants, people, whom, he, admired, as, visionaries, far, ahead, of, their, time, and, heralding, a, new, age, the, only, mathematician, on, his, list, was, bernhard, riemann, influenced, by, the, catholic, mystic, marthe, robin, who, was, claimed, to, have, survived, on, the, holy, eucharist, alone, grothendieck, almost, starved, himself, to, death, in, 1988, his, growing, preoccupation, with, spiritual, matters, was, also, evident, in, a, letter, entitled, lettre, de, la, bonne, nouvelle, sent, to, 250, friends, in, january, 1990, in, it, he, described, his, encounters, with, a, deity, and, announced, that, a, new, age, would, commence, on, 14, october, 1996, the, grothendieck, festschrift, published, in, 1990, was, a, three, volume, collection, of, research, papers, to, mark, his, sixtieth, birthday, in, 1988, more, than, 20, 000, pages, of, grothendieck, s, mathematical, and, other, writings, are, held, at, the, university, of, montpellier, and, remain, unpublished, they, have, been, digitized, for, preservation, and, are, freely, available, in, open, access, through, the, institut, montpelli, rain, alexander, grothendieck, portal, in, 1991, grothendieck, moved, to, a, new, address, that, he, did, not, share, with, his, previous, contacts, in, the, mathematical, community, very, few, people, visited, him, afterward, local, villagers, helped, sustain, him, with, a, more, varied, diet, after, he, tried, to, live, on, a, staple, of, dandelion, soup, at, some, point, leila, schneps, and, pierre, lochak, located, him, then, carried, on, a, brief, correspondence, thus, they, became, among, the, last, members, of, the, mathematical, establishment, to, come, into, contact, with, him, after, his, death, it, was, revealed, that, he, lived, alone, in, a, house, in, lasserre, ari, ge, a, small, village, at, the, foot, of, the, pyrenees, in, january, 2010, grothendieck, wrote, the, letter, entitled, d, claration, d, intention, de, non, publication, to, luc, illusie, claiming, that, all, materials, published, in, his, absence, had, been, published, without, his, permission, he, asked, that, none, of, his, work, be, reproduced, in, whole, or, in, part, and, that, copies, of, this, work, be, removed, from, libraries, he, characterized, a, website, devoted, to, his, work, as, an, abomination, his, dictate, may, have, been, reversed, in, 2010, in, september, 2014, almost, totally, deaf, and, blind, he, asked, a, neighbour, to, buy, him, a, revolver, so, he, could, kill, himself, on, 13, november, 2014, aged, 86, grothendieck, died, in, the, hospital, of, saint, lizier, or, saint, girons, ari, ge, grothendieck, was, born, in, weimar, germany, in, 1938, aged, ten, he, moved, to, france, as, a, refugee, records, of, his, nationality, were, destroyed, in, the, fall, of, nazi, germany, in, 1945, and, he, did, not, apply, for, french, citizenship, after, the, war, thus, he, became, a, stateless, person, for, at, least, the, majority, of, his, working, life, and, he, traveled, on, a, nansen, passport, part, of, his, reluctance, to, hold, french, nationality, is, attributed, to, not, wishing, to, serve, in, the, french, military, particularly, due, to, the, algerian, war, 1954, 62, he, eventually, applied, for, french, citizenship, in, the, early, 1980s, after, he, was, well, past, the, age, that, exempted, him, from, military, service, grothendieck, was, very, close, to, his, mother, to, whom, he, dedicated, his, dissertation, she, died, in, 1957, from, tuberculosis, that, she, contracted, in, camps, for, displaced, persons, he, had, five, children, a, son, with, his, landlady, during, his, time, in, nancy, three, children, johanna, 1959, alexander, 1961, and, mathieu, 1965, with, his, wife, mireille, dufour, and, one, child, with, justine, skalba, with, whom, he, lived, in, a, commune, in, the, early, 1970s, grothendieck, s, early, mathematical, work, was, in, functional, analysis, between, 1949, and, 1953, he, worked, on, his, doctoral, thesis, in, this, subject, at, nancy, supervised, by, jean, dieudonn, and, laurent, schwartz, his, key, contributions, include, topological, tensor, products, of, topological, vector, spaces, the, theory, of, nuclear, spaces, as, foundational, for, schwartz, distributions, and, the, application, of, l, p, spaces, in, studying, linear, maps, between, topological, vector, spaces, in, a, few, years, he, had, become, a, leading, authority, on, this, area, of, functional, analysis, to, the, extent, that, dieudonn, compares, his, impact, in, this, field, to, that, of, banach, it, is, however, in, algebraic, geometry, and, related, fields, where, grothendieck, did, his, most, important, and, influential, work, from, approximately, 1955, he, started, to, work, on, sheaf, theory, and, homological, algebra, producing, the, influential, t, hoku, paper, sur, quelques, points, d, alg, bre, homologique, published, in, the, tohoku, mathematical, journal, in, 1957, where, he, introduced, abelian, categories, and, applied, their, theory, to, show, that, sheaf, cohomology, may, be, defined, as, certain, derived, functors, in, this, context, homological, methods, and, sheaf, theory, had, already, been, introduced, in, algebraic, geometry, by, jean, pierre, serre, and, others, after, sheaves, had, been, defined, by, jean, leray, grothendieck, took, them, to, a, higher, level, of, abstraction, and, turned, them, into, a, key, organising, principle, of, his, theory, he, shifted, attention, from, the, study, of, individual, varieties, to, his, relative, point, of, view, pairs, of, varieties, related, by, a, morphism, allowing, a, broad, generalization, of, many, classical, theorems, the, first, major, application, was, the, relative, version, of, serre, s, theorem, showing, that, the, cohomology, of, a, coherent, sheaf, on, a, complete, variety, is, finite, dimensional, grothendieck, s, theorem, shows, that, the, higher, direct, images, of, coherent, sheaves, under, a, proper, map, are, coherent, this, reduces, to, serre, s, theorem, over, a, one, point, space, in, 1956, he, applied, the, same, thinking, to, the, riemann, roch, theorem, which, recently, had, been, generalized, to, any, dimension, by, hirzebruch, the, grothendieck, riemann, roch, theorem, was, announced, by, grothendieck, at, the, initial, mathematische, arbeitstagung, in, bonn, in, 1957, it, appeared, in, print, in, a, paper, written, by, armand, borel, with, serre, this, result, was, his, first, work, in, algebraic, geometry, grothendieck, went, on, to, plan, and, execute, a, programme, for, rebuilding, the, foundations, of, algebraic, geometry, which, at, the, time, were, in, a, state, of, flux, and, under, discussion, in, claude, chevalley, s, seminar, he, outlined, his, programme, in, his, talk, at, the, 1958, international, congress, of, mathematicians, his, foundational, work, on, algebraic, geometry, is, at, a, higher, level, of, abstraction, than, all, prior, versions, he, adapted, the, use, of, non, closed, generic, points, which, led, to, the, theory, of, schemes, grothendieck, also, pioneered, the, systematic, use, of, nilpotents, as, functions, these, can, take, only, the, value, 0, but, they, carry, infinitesimal, information, in, purely, algebraic, settings, his, theory, of, schemes, has, become, established, as, the, best, universal, foundation, for, this, field, because, of, its, expressiveness, as, well, as, its, technical, depth, in, that, setting, one, can, use, birational, geometry, techniques, from, number, theory, galois, theory, commutative, algebra, and, close, analogues, of, the, methods, of, algebraic, topology, all, in, an, integrated, way, grothendieck, is, noted, for, his, mastery, of, abstract, approaches, to, mathematics, and, his, perfectionism, in, matters, of, formulation, and, presentation, relatively, little, of, his, work, after, 1960, was, published, by, the, conventional, route, of, the, learned, journal, circulating, initially, in, duplicated, volumes, of, seminar, notes, his, influence, was, to, a, considerable, extent, personal, his, influence, spilled, over, into, many, other, branches, of, mathematics, for, example, the, contemporary, theory, of, d, modules, although, lauded, as, the, einstein, of, mathematics, his, work, also, provoked, adverse, reactions, with, many, mathematicians, seeking, out, more, concrete, areas, and, problems, the, bulk, of, grothendieck, s, published, work, is, collected, in, the, monumental, yet, incomplete, l, ments, de, g, om, trie, alg, brique, ega, and, s, minaire, de, g, om, trie, alg, brique, sga, the, collection, fondements, de, la, g, ometrie, alg, brique, fga, which, gathers, together, talks, given, in, the, s, minaire, bourbaki, also, contains, important, material, grothendieck, s, work, includes, the, invention, of, the, tale, and, l, adic, cohomology, theories, which, explain, an, observation, made, by, andr, weil, that, argued, for, a, connection, between, the, topological, characteristics, of, a, variety, and, its, diophantine, number, theoretic, properties, for, example, the, number, of, solutions, of, an, equation, over, a, finite, field, reflects, the, topological, nature, of, its, solutions, over, the, complex, numbers, weil, had, realized, that, to, prove, such, a, connection, one, needed, a, new, cohomology, theory, but, neither, he, nor, any, other, expert, saw, how, to, accomplish, this, until, such, a, theory, was, expressed, by, grothendieck, this, program, culminated, in, the, proofs, of, the, weil, conjectures, the, last, of, which, was, settled, by, grothendieck, s, student, pierre, deligne, in, the, early, 1970s, after, grothendieck, had, largely, withdrawn, from, mathematics, in, grothendieck, s, retrospective, r, coltes, et, semailles, he, identified, twelve, of, his, contributions, that, he, believed, qualified, as, great, ideas, in, chronological, order, they, are, here, the, term, yoga, denotes, a, kind, of, meta, theory, that, may, be, used, heuristically, michel, raynaud, writes, the, other, terms, ariadne, s, thread, and, philosophy, as, effective, equivalents, grothendieck, wrote, that, of, these, themes, the, largest, in, scope, was, topoi, as, they, synthesized, algebraic, geometry, topology, and, arithmetic, the, theme, that, had, been, most, extensively, developed, was, schemes, which, were, the, framework, par, excellence, for, eight, of, the, other, themes, all, but, 1, 5, and, 12, grothendieck, wrote, that, the, first, and, last, themes, topological, tensor, products, and, regular, configurations, were, of, more, modest, size, than, the, others, topological, tensor, products, had, played, the, role, of, a, tool, rather, than, of, a, source, of, inspiration, for, further, developments, but, he, expected, that, regular, configurations, could, not, be, exhausted, within, the, lifetime, of, a, mathematician, who, devoted, oneself, to, it, he, believed, that, the, deepest, themes, were, motives, anabelian, geometry, and, galois, teichm, ller, theory, grothendieck, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, greatest, mathematician, of, the, twentieth, century, in, an, obituary, david, mumford, and, john, tate, wrote, although, mathematics, became, more, and, more, abstract, and, general, throughout, the, 20th, century, it, was, alexander, grothendieck, who, was, the, greatest, master, of, this, trend, his, unique, skill, was, to, eliminate, all, unnecessary, hypotheses, and, burrow, into, an, area, so, deeply, that, its, inner, patterns, on, the, most, abstract, level, revealed, themselves, and, then, like, a, magician, show, how, the, solution, of, old, problems, fell, out, in, straightforward, ways, now, that, their, real, nature, had, been, revealed, by, the, 1970s, grothendieck, s, work, was, seen, as, influential, not, only, in, algebraic, geometry, and, the, allied, fields, of, sheaf, theory, and, homological, algebra, but, influenced, logic, in, the, field, of, categorical, logic, grothendieck, approached, algebraic, geometry, by, clarifying, the, foundations, of, the, field, and, by, developing, mathematical, tools, intended, to, prove, a, number, of, notable, conjectures, algebraic, geometry, has, traditionally, meant, the, understanding, of, geometric, objects, such, as, algebraic, curves, and, surfaces, through, the, study, of, the, algebraic, equations, for, those, objects, properties, of, algebraic, equations, are, in, turn, studied, using, the, techniques, of, ring, theory, in, this, approach, the, properties, of, a, geometric, object, are, related, to, the, properties, of, an, associated, ring, the, space, e, g, real, complex, or, projective, in, which, the, object, is, defined, is, extrinsic, to, the, object, while, the, ring, is, intrinsic, grothendieck, laid, a, new, foundation, for, algebraic, geometry, by, making, intrinsic, spaces, spectra, and, associated, rings, the, primary, objects, of, study, to, that, end, he, developed, the, theory, of, schemes, that, informally, can, be, thought, of, as, topological, spaces, on, which, a, commutative, ring, is, associated, to, every, open, subset, of, the, space, schemes, have, become, the, basic, objects, of, study, for, practitioners, of, modern, algebraic, geometry, their, use, as, a, foundation, allowed, geometry, to, absorb, technical, advances, from, other, fields, his, generalization, of, the, classical, riemann, roch, theorem, related, topological, properties, of, complex, algebraic, curves, to, their, algebraic, structure, and, now, bears, his, name, being, called, the, grothendieck, hirzebruch, riemann, roch, theorem, the, tools, he, developed, to, prove, this, theorem, started, the, study, of, algebraic, and, topological, k, theory, which, explores, the, topological, properties, of, objects, by, associating, them, with, rings, after, direct, contact, with, grothendieck, s, ideas, at, the, bonn, arbeitstagung, topological, k, theory, was, founded, by, michael, atiyah, and, friedrich, hirzebruch, grothendieck, s, construction, of, new, cohomology, theories, which, use, algebraic, techniques, to, study, topological, objects, has, influenced, the, development, of, algebraic, number, theory, algebraic, topology, and, representation, theory, as, part, of, this, project, his, creation, of, topos, theory, a, category, theoretic, generalization, of, point, set, topology, has, influenced, the, fields, of, set, theory, and, mathematical, logic, the, weil, conjectures, were, formulated, in, the, later, 1940s, as, a, set, of, mathematical, problems, in, arithmetic, geometry, they, describe, properties, of, analytic, invariants, called, local, zeta, functions, of, the, number, of, points, on, an, algebraic, curve, or, variety, of, higher, dimension, grothendieck, s, discovery, of, the, adic, tale, cohomology, the, first, example, of, a, weil, cohomology, theory, opened, the, way, for, a, proof, of, the, weil, conjectures, ultimately, completed, in, the, 1970s, by, his, student, pierre, deligne, grothendieck, s, large, scale, approach, has, been, called, a, visionary, program, the, adic, cohomology, then, became, a, fundamental, tool, for, number, theorists, with, applications, to, the, langlands, program, grothendieck, s, conjectural, theory, of, motives, was, intended, to, be, the, adic, theory, but, without, the, choice, of, a, prime, number, it, did, not, provide, the, intended, route, to, the, weil, conjectures, but, has, been, behind, modern, developments, in, algebraic, k, theory, motivic, homotopy, theory, and, motivic, integration, this, theory, daniel, quillen, s, work, and, grothendieck, s, theory, of, chern, classes, are, considered, the, background, to, the, theory, of, algebraic, cobordism, another, algebraic, analogue, of, topological, ideas, grothendieck, s, emphasis, on, the, role, of, universal, properties, across, varied, mathematical, structures, brought, category, theory, into, the, mainstream, as, an, organizing, principle, for, mathematics, in, general, among, its, uses, category, theory, creates, a, common, language, for, describing, similar, structures, and, techniques, seen, in, many, different, mathematical, systems, his, notion, of, abelian, category, is, now, the, basic, object, of, study, in, homological, algebra, the, emergence, of, a, separate, mathematical, discipline, of, category, theory, has, been, attributed, to, grothendieck, s, influence, although, unintentional, colonel, l, grimas, colonel, tears, in, english, a, novel, by, puerto, rican, costa, rican, writer, carlos, fonseca, is, about, grothendieck, the, band, stone, hill, all, stars, have, a, song, named, after, alexander, grothendieck, the, benjam, n, labatut, book, when, we, cease, to, understand, the, world, dedicates, one, chapter, to, the, work, and, life, of, grothendieck, introducing, his, story, by, reference, to, the, japanese, mathematician, shinichi, mochizuki, the, book, is, a, lightly, fictionalized, account, of, the, world, of, scientific, inquiry, and, was, a, finalist, for, the, national, book, award, in, cormac, mccarthy, s, the, passenger, and, its, sequel,
