the, common, ones, are, that, he, missed, his, native, land, that, he, was, in, the, employ, of, the, british, and, the, congruence, of, the, goals, of, both, wars, the, first, explanation, suggests, that, when, the, wars, of, independence, began, san, mart, n, thought, that, his, duty, was, to, return, to, his, country, and, serve, in, the, military, conflict, the, second, explanation, suggests, that, britain, which, would, benefit, from, the, independence, of, the, south, american, countries, sent, san, mart, n, to, achieve, it, the, third, suggests, that, both, wars, were, caused, by, the,

miguel, carrera, had, obtained, his, own, ships, after, the, disaster, of, rancagua, which, he, intended, to, use, to, liberate, chile, however, as, this, had, already, been, achieved, by, san, mart, n, he, subsequently, refused, to, place, his, fleet, under, the, army, of, the, andes, carrera, was, an, enemy, of, o, higgins, and, sought, to, navigate, to, chile, and, depose, him, which, led, to, his, imprisonment, by, pueyrred, n, and, the, confiscation, of, his, ships, san, mart, n, requested, help, from, british, admiral, william, bowles, he, wrote, from, chile, and, expected, to, find, him, in, buenos, aires, but, bowles, had, embarked, for, rio, de, janeiro, bowles, considered, that, san, mart, n, was, more, trustworthy, than, alvear, and, praised, his, support, for, monarchism, san, mart, n, did, not, obtain, the, ships, and, interrupted, the, correspondence, with, bowles, for, some, months, he, returned, to, chile, his, wife, remedios, stayed, in, buenos, aires, with, her,

setback, the, army, was, reorganized, again, but, the, deaths, injuries, and, desertions, caused, by, the, defeat, at, cancha, rayada, reduced, its, size, to, 5, 000, soldiers, which, was, closer, to, the, royalist, forces, they, took, position, next, to, the, maipo, river, near, santiago, san, mart, n, made, a, brief, reconnaissance, of, the, royalist, army, and, noticed, several, flaws, in, their, organization, feeling, secure, of, victory, he, claimed, that, osorio, is, clumsier, than, i, thought, today, s, triumph, is, ours, the, sun, as, witness, the, battle, began, at, 11, 00, am,

and, long, live, the, homeland, respectively, finally, the, royalists, ended, their, cries, and, began, to, disperse, when, the, regiment, of, burgos, realized, that, their, line, was, broken, they, stopped, resisting, and, the, soldiers, began, to, disperse, the, cavalry, pursued, and, killed, most, of, them, at, the, end, of, the, battle, the, royalists, had, been, trapped, among, the, units, of, las, heras, in, the, west, alvarado, in, the, middle, quintana, in, the, east, and, the, cavalries, of, zapiola, and, freire, osorio, tried, to, fall, back, to, the, hacienda, lo, espejo, but, could, not, reach, it, so, he, tried, to, escape, to, talcahuano, ord, ez, made, his, last, stand, at, that, hacienda, where, 500, royalists, died, the, battle, ended, in, the, afternoon, o, higgins, still, injured, by, the, wound, received, in, cancha, rayada, arrived, during, the, final, action, at, the, hacienda, he, claimed, glory, to, the, savior, of, chile, in, reference, to, san, mart, n, who, praised, him, for, going, to, the, battlefield, with, his, unhealed, wound, they, made, an, embrace, on, their, horses, now, known, as, the, embrace, of, maip, the, battle, of, maip, secured,

chileans, luis, and, juan, jos, carrera, brothers, of, jos, miguel, carrera, the, specific, initiative, of, those, executions, is, controversial, chilean, historian, benjam, n, vicu, a, mackenna, indicts, san, mart, n, while, j, c, raffo, de, la, reta, blames, o, higgins, instead, manuel, rodr, guez, was, also, imprisoned, and, then, killed, in, prison, this, death, may, have, been, decided, by, the, lautaro, lodge, san, mart, n, could, not, have, taken, part, in, it, as, he, was, already, on, the, way, to, buenos, aires, san, mart, n, was, not, well, received, in, buenos, aires, pueyrred, n, initially, declined, to, give, further, help, citing, the, conflicts, with, the, federal, caudillos, and, the, organization, of, a, huge, royalist, army, in, c, diz, that, would, try, to, reconquer, the, la, plata, basin, he, thought, that, chile, should, organize, the, navy, against, peru, not, buenos, aires, san, mart, n, discussed, with, him, and, finally, got, financing, of, 500, 000, pesos, he, returned, to, mendoza, with, his, wife, and, daughter, and, received, a, letter, from, pueyrred, n, who, said, that, buenos, aires, could, only, deliver, one, third, of, the, promised, funds, this, complicated, the, project, as, neither, santiago, de, chile, nor, mendoza, had, the, resources, needed, san, mart, n, resigned, from, the, army, but, it, is, unclear, whether, his, decision, to, resign, was, sincere, or, was, to, apply, pressure, to, his, backers, the, government, of, buenos, aires, still, considered, san, mart, n, vital, to, the, national, defense, so, pueyrred, n, agreed, to, pay, the, 500, 000, pesos, requested, and, encouraged, san, mart, n, to, withdraw, his, resignation, san, mart, n, proposed, to, mediate, between, buenos, aires, and, the, liga, federal, led, by, artigas, he, thought, that, the, civil, war, was, counter, productive, to, national, unity, and, that, an, end, to, hostilities, would, free, resources, needed, for, the, navy, he, calculated, that, artigas, might, condition, the, peace, on, a, joint, declaration, of, war, to, colonial, brazil, so, san, mart, n, proposed, to, defeat, the, royalists, first, and, then, demand, the, return, of, the, eastern, bank, to, the, united, provinces, o, higgins, recommended, caution, fearing, that, san, mart, n, might, be, captured, pueyrred, n, rejected, the, mediation, as, he, did, not, recognize, artigas, as, an, equal, to, negotiate, with, him, although, artigas, was, defeated, by, the, luso, brazilian, armies, his, allies, estanislao, l, pez, and, francisco, ram, rez,

aid, buenos, aires, in, the, conflict, guido, noted, to, san, mart, n, that, if, both, armies, did, that, the, north, of, argentina, and, chile, would, be, easily, reconquered, by, the, royalists, san, mart, n, also, knew, that, most, of, the, soldiers, of, the, army, of, the, andes, would, not, be, willing, to, aid, buenos, aires, in, the, civil, war, as, most, were, from, other, provinces, or, from, chile, san, mart, n, had, doubts, as, well, about, the, projected, arrival, of, a, large, military, expedition, from, spain, as, the, absolutist, restoration, of, ferdinand, vii, had, met, severe, resistance, in, spain, san, mart, n, finally, kept, the, army, in, chile, when, belgrano, s, lieutenant, viamonte, signed, an, armistice, with, l, pez, he, thought, that, the, conflict, had, ended, however, the, minister, of, war, mat, as, de, irigoyen, ordered, once, more, the, return, of, the, army, of, the, andes, and, appointed, francisco, fern, ndez, de, la, cruz, as, its, leader, displacing, san, mart, n, san, mart, n, resigned, again, and, observed, that, the, army, would, not, be, able, to, cross, the, andes, from, chile, to, buenos, aires, because, the, winter, snow, was, blocking, the, trails, all, the, leaders, of, the, military, units, of, the, army, of, the, andes, refused, to, go, to, buenos, aires, as, their, soldiers, would, mutiny, or, desert, facing, both,

soldiers, instead, and, cochrane, s, navy, another, 1, 600, with, this, disparity, of, forces, san, mart, n, tried, to, avoid, battles, he, tried, instead, to, divide, the, enemy, forces, in, several, locations, as, he, did, during, the, crossing, of, the, andes, and, trap, the, royalists, with, a, pincer, movement, with, either, reinforcements, of, the, army, of, the, north, from, the, south, or, the, army, of, sim, n, bol, var, from, the, north, he, also, tried, to, promote, rebellions, and, insurrection, within, the, royalist, ranks, and, promised, the, emancipation, of, any, slaves, that,

the, 1812, spanish, constitution, per, inside, spain, and, san, mart, n, demanded, the, independence, of, peru, with, an, independent, monarchy, the, rejection, of, the, spanish, constitution, was, motivated, by, the, disproportional, representation, of, the, americas, in, the, constituent, assembly, that, wrote, it, both, armies, agreed, a, temporary, armistice, san, mart, n, proposed, to, establish, a, constitutional, monarchy, with, a, european, monarch, with, a, regency, ruling, in, the, interim, the, proposal, was, rejected, on, the, grounds, that, they, could, not, accept, it, without, ferdinand, s, approval, as, hostilities, renewed, san, mart, n, organized, several, guerrilla, groups, in, the, countryside, and, laid, siege, to, lima, but, did, not, force, his, entry, as, he, did, not, want, to, appear, as, a, conqueror, to, the, local, population, however, de, la, serna, suddenly, left, the, city, with, his, army, for, unknown, reasons, san, mart, n, called, for, an, open, cabildo, to, discuss, the, independence, of, the, country, which, was, agreed, with, this, approval, the, authority, in, lima, the, support, of, the, northern, provinces, and, the, port, of, el, callao, under, siege, san, mart, n, declared, the, independence, of, peru, on, 28, july, 1821, the, war, however, had, not, ended, yet, unlike, chile, peru, had, no, local, politicians, of, the, stature, of, o, higgins, so, san, mart, n, became, the, leader, of, the, government, even, though, he, did, not, want, to, he, was, appointed, protector, of, peru, as, peruvian, society, was, highly, conservative, san, mart, n, did, not, take, the, liberal, ideas, too, far, immediately, the, provisional, statutes, contained, few, changes, and, ratified, several, existing, laws, all, the, types, of, servitude, imposed, on, the, natives, such, as, mita, and, yanaconazgo, were, abolished, and, the, natives, received, citizenship, he, did, not, abolish, slavery, completely, as, peru, had, 40, 000, slaveowners, and, declared, freedom, of, wombs, instead, which, emancipated, the, sons, of, slaves, he, emancipated, as, well, the, slaves, of, the, royalists, who, left, lima, he, also, abolished, the, inquisition, and, corporal, punishment, and, enacted, freedom, of, speech, his, appeal, to, subaltern, groups, extended, towards, women, san, mart, n, promoted, female, patriotism, as, the, protector, of, peru, as, a, means, of, recruiting, a, force, to, spread, his, independence, ideals, during, his, stay, in, peru, san, mart, n, had, a, romance, with, rosa, campuzano, a, woman, from, guayaquil, the, royalist, armies, that, stayed, in, the, peruvian, countryside, headed, to, lima, led, by, canterac, in, a, confusing, episode, there, was, no, battle, as, neither, one, attacked, canterac, changed, his, path, to, el, callao, took, resources, from, it, and, returned, to, his, base, there, was, no, battle, during, their, return, either, without, resources, el, callao, surrendered, in, a, few, days, both, armies, took, inadvisable, actions, san, mart, n, allowed, canterac, to, receive, reinforcements, and, canterac, left, a, key, military, objective, incapable, to, resist, there, is, no, known, documentation, that, provides, a, reasonable, explanation, of, those, events, cochrane, had, several, disputes, with, san, mart, n, he, discussed, several, of, his, actions, and, tried, to, bypass, his, authority, during, the, blockade, of, el, callao, he, proposed, that, o, higgins, take, control, of, the, mission, and, send, any, spoils, of, battle, to, chile, as, san, mart, n, was, appointed, protector, of, peru, cochrane, reasoned, that, san, mart, n, was, no, longer, under, chilean, command, and, took, the, navy, away, in, later, years, cochrane, made, accusations, against, san, mart, n, in, chile, bol, var, took, control, of, caracas, with, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, carabobo, and, the, congress, of, c, cuta, issued, laws, similar, to, those, in, per, guayaquil, declared, independence, and, bol, var, sent, antonio, jos, de, sucre, to, reinforce, them, sucre, s, forces, were, not, enough, and, requested, help, from, san, mart, n, peru, sent, a, military, force, of, 1, 300, men, bol, var, entered, the, city, a, month, later, and, claimed, that, for, historical, reasons, quito, should, be, part, of, colombia, san, mart, n, and, bol, var, sought, to, generate, latin, american, integration, but, disagreed, on, the, type, of, government, bol, var, proposed, a, republic, and, san, mart, n, a, constitutional, monarchy, reasoning, that, it, would, be, easier, to, receive, international, recognition, for, the, now, independent, south, american, nations, peru, and, colombia, signed, a, treaty, of, integration, to, be, proposed, to, chile, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, paraguay, and, at, a, later, point, to, the, united, provinces, of, central, america, and, the, empire, of, brazil, san, mart, n, thought, that, if, he, joined, forces, with, bol, var, he, would, be, able, to, defeat, the, remnant, royalist, forces, in, peru, both, liberators, would, meet, in, quito, so, san, mart, n, appointed, torre, tagle, to, manage, the, government, during, his, absence, bol, var, was, unable, to, meet, san, mart, n, at, the, arranged, date, so, san, mart, n, returned, to, lima, but, still, left, tagle,
