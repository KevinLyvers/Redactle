half, century, initially, the, song, was, not, recognized, as, a, hit, however, broadway, producer, jesse, lasky, was, uncertain, about, using, it, although, he, did, include, it, in, his, follies, show, it, was, performed, as, an, instrumental, but, did, not, impress, audiences, and, was, soon, dropped, from, the, show, s, score, berlin, regarded, it, as, a, failure, he, then, wrote, lyrics, to, the, score, played, it, again, in, another, broadway, review, and, this, time, variety, news, weekly, called, it, the, musical, sensation, of, the, decade, 68, composer, george, gershwin, foreseeing, its, influence, said, it, was, the, first, real, american, musical, work, adding, berlin, had, shown, us, the, way, it, was, now, easier, to, attain, our, ideal, 117, berlin, was, flabbergasted, by, the, sudden, international, popularity, of, the, song, and, wondered, why, it, became, a, sudden, hit, he, decided, it, was, partly, because, the, lyrics, silly, though, it, was, was, fundamentally, right, the, melody, started, the, heels, and, shoulders, of, all, america, and, a, good, section, of, europe, to, rocking, 69, in, 1913, berlin, was, featured, in, the, london, revue, hello, ragtime, where, he, introduced, that, international, rag, a, song, he, had, written, for, the, occasion, furia, writes, that, the, international, success, of, alexander, s, ragtime, band, gave, ragtime, new, life, and, sparked, a, national, dance, craze, two, dancers, who, expressed, that, craze, were, vernon, and, irene, castle, in, 1914, berlin, wrote, a, ragtime, revue, watch, your, step, which, starred, the, couple, and, showcased, their, talents, on, stage, that, musical, revue, became, berlin, s, first, complete, score, with, songs, that, radiated, musical, and, lyrical, sophistication, berlin, s, songs, signified, modernism, and, they, signified, the, cultural, struggle, between, victorian, gentility, and, the, purveyors, of, liberation, indulgence, and, leisure, says, furia, the, song, play, a, simple, melody, became, the, first, of, his, famous, double, songs, in, which, two, different, melodies, and, lyrics, are, counterpointed, against, one, another, variety, called, watch, your, step, the, first, syncopated, musical, where, the, sets, and, the, girls, were, gorgeous, berlin, was, then, 26, and, the, success, of, the, show, was, riding, on, his, name, alone, variety, said, the, show, was, a, terrific, hit, from, its, opening, night, it, compared, berlin, s, newfound, status, as, a, composer, with, that, of, the, times, building, that, youthful, marvel, of, syncopated, melody, is, proving, things, in, watch, your, step, firstly, that, he, is, not, alone, a, rag, composer, and, that, he, is, one, of, the, greatest, lyric, writers, america, has, ever, produced, 173, whitcomb, also, points, out, the, irony, that, russia, the, country, berlin, s, family, was, forced, to, leave, flung, itself, into, the, ragtime, beat, with, an, abandon, bordering, on, mania, for, example, prince, felix, yusupov, a, recent, oxford, undergraduate, of, russian, noble, lineage, and, heir, to, the, largest, estate, in, russia, was, described, by, his, dance, partner, as, wriggling, around, the, ballroom, like, a, demented, worm, screaming, for, more, ragtime, and, more, champagne, 183, my, ambition, is, to, reach, the, heart, of, the, average, american, not, the, highbrow, nor, the, lowbrow, but, that, vast, intermediate, crew, which, is, the, real, soul, of, the, country, the, highbrow, is, likely, to, be, superficial, overtrained, supersensitive, the, lowbrow, is, warped, subnormal, my, public, is, the, real, people, irving, berlin, 11, some, of, the, songs, berlin, created, came, out, of, his, own, sadness, for, instance, in, 1912, he, married, dorothy, goetz, the, sister, of, songwriter, e, ray, goetz, she, died, six, months, later, of, typhoid, fever, contracted, during, their, honeymoon, in, havana, the, song, he, wrote, to, express, his, grief, when, i, lost, you, was, his, first, ballad, it, was, an, immediate, popular, hit, and, sold, more, than, a, million, copies, he, began, to, realize, that, ragtime, was, not, a, good, musical, style, for, serious, romantic, expression, and, over, the, next, few, years, adapted, his, style, by, writing, more, love, songs, in, 1915, he, wrote, the, hit, i, love, a, piano, a, comical, and, erotic, ragtime, love, song, by, 1918, he, had, written, hundreds, of, songs, mostly, topical, which, enjoyed, brief, popularity, many, of, the, songs, were, for, the, new, dances, then, appearing, such, as, the, grizzly, bear, chicken, walk, or, foxtrot, after, a, hawaiian, dance, craze, began, he, wrote, that, hula, hula, and, then, did, a, string, of, southern, songs, such, as, when, the, midnight, choo, choo, leaves, for, alabam, during, this, period, he, was, creating, a, few, new, songs, every, week, including, songs, aimed, at, the, various, immigrant, cultures, arriving, from, europe, on, one, occasion, berlin, whose, face, was, still, not, known, was, on, a, train, trip, and, decided, to, entertain, the, fellow, passengers, with, some, music, they, asked, him, how, he, knew, so, many, hit, songs, and, berlin, modestly, replied, i, wrote, them, 53, an, important, song, that, berlin, wrote, during, his, transition, from, writing, ragtime, to, lyrical, ballads, was, a, pretty, girl, is, like, a, melody, which, became, one, of, berlin, s, first, big, guns, says, historian, alec, wilder, the, song, was, written, for, ziegfeld, s, follies, of, 1919, and, became, the, musical, s, lead, song, its, popularity, was, so, great, that, it, later, became, the, theme, for, all, of, ziegfeld, s, revues, and, the, theme, song, in, the, 1936, film, the, great, ziegfeld, wilder, puts, it, on, the, same, level, as, jerome, kern, s, pure, melodies, and, in, comparison, with, berlin, s, earlier, music, says, it, is, extraordinary, that, such, a, development, in, style, and, sophistication, should, have, taken, place, in, a, single, year, 53, on, april, 1, 1917, after, president, woodrow, wilson, declared, that, america, would, enter, world, war, i, berlin, felt, that, tin, pan, alley, should, do, its, duty, and, support, the, war, with, inspirational, songs, berlin, wrote, the, song, for, your, country, and, my, country, stating, that, we, must, speak, with, the, sword, not, the, pen, to, show, our, appreciation, to, america, for, opening, up, her, heart, and, welcoming, every, immigrant, group, he, also, co, wrote, a, song, aimed,

times, the, song, was, written, by, berlin, twenty, years, earlier, but, he, filed, it, away, until, 1938, when, kate, smith, needed, a, patriotic, song, to, mark, the, 20th, anniversary, of, armistice, day, celebrating, the, end, of, world, war, i, its, release, near, the, end, of, the, depression, which, had, by, then, gone, on, for, nine, years, enshrined, a, strain, of, official, patriotism, intertwined, with, a, religious, faith, that, runs, deep, in, the, american, psyche, stated, the, new, york, times, berlin, s, daughter, mary, ellin, barrett, states, that, the, song, was, actually, very, personal, for, her, father, and, was, intended, as, an, expression, of, his, deep, gratitude, to, the, nation, for, merely, allowing, him, an, immigrant, raised, in, poverty, to, become, a, successful, songwriter, to, me, said, berlin, god, bless, america, was, not, just, a, song, but, an, expression, of, my, feeling, toward, the, country, to, which, i, owe, what, i, have, and, what, i, am, the, economist, magazine, writes, that, berlin, was, producing, a, deep, felt, paean, to, the, country, that, had, given, him, what, he, would, have, said, was, everything, it, quickly, became, a, second, national, anthem, after, america, entered, world, war, ii, a, few, years, later, over, the, decades, it, has, earned, millions, for, the, boy, scouts, and, girl, scouts, to, whom, berlin, assigned, all, royalties, in, 1954, berlin, received, a, special, congressional, gold, medal, from, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, for, contributing, the, song, the, song, was, heard, after, september, 11, 2001, as, u, s, senators, and, congressmen, stood, on, the, capitol, steps, and, sang, it, after, the, terrorist, attacks, on, the, world, trade, center, it, is, often, played, by, sports, teams, such, as, major, league, baseball, the, philadelphia, flyers, hockey, team, started, playing, it, before, crucial, contests, when, the, 1980, u, s, olympic, hockey, team, pulled, off, the, greatest, upset, in, sports, history, referred, to, as, the, miracle, on, ice, the, players, spontaneously, sang, it, as, americans, were, overcome, by, patriotism, though, most, of, his, works, for, the, broadway, stage, took, the, form, of, revues, collections, of, songs, with, no, unifying, plot, he, did, write, a, number, of, book, shows, the, cocoanuts, 1929, was, a, light,

telling, my, comfortable, well, fed, well, dressed, listeners, about, my, people, those, who, had, been, slaves, and, those, who, were, now, downtrodden, and, oppressed, berlin, loved, his, country, and, wrote, many, songs, reflecting, his, patriotism, treasury, secretary, henry, morgenthau, requested, a, song, to, inspire, americans, to, buy, war, bonds, for, which, he, wrote, any, bonds, today, he, assigned, all, royalties, to, the, united, states, treasury, department, he, then, wrote, songs, for, various, government, agencies, and, likewise, assigned, all, profits, to, them, angels, of, mercy, for, the, american, red, cross, arms, for, the, love, of, america, for, the, u, s, army, ordnance, department, and, i, paid, my, income, tax, today, again, to, treasury, when, the, united, states, joined, world, war, ii, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, december, 1941, berlin, immediately, began, composing, a, number, of, patriotic, songs, his, most, notable, and, valuable, contribution, to, the, war, effort, was, a, stage, show, he, wrote, called, this, is, the, army, it, was, taken, to, broadway, and, then, on, to, washington, d, c, where, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, attended, it, was, eventually, shown, at, military, bases, throughout, the, world, including, london, north, africa, italy, middle, east, and, pacific, countries, sometimes, in, close, proximity, to, battle, zones, berlin, wrote, nearly, three, dozen, songs, for, the, show, which, contained, a, cast, of, 300, men, he, supervised, the, production, and, traveled, with, it, always, singing, oh, how, i, hate, to, get, up, in, the, morning, the, show, kept, him, away, from, his, family, for, three, and, a, half, years, during, which, time, he, took, neither, salary, nor, expenses, and, turned, over, all, profits, to, the, army, emergency, relief, fund, 81, the, play, was, adapted, into, a, movie, of, the, same, name, in, 1943, directed, by, michael, curtiz, co, starring, joan, leslie, and, ronald, reagan, who, was, then, an, army, lieutenant, kate, smith, also, sang, god, bless, america, in, the, film, with, a, backdrop, showing, families, anxious, over, the, coming, war, the, show, became, a, hit, movie, and, a, morale, boosting, road, show, that, toured, the, battlefronts, of, europe, the, shows, and, movie, combined, raised, more, than, 10, million, for, the, army, and, in, recognition, of, his, contributions, to, troop, morale, berlin, was, awarded, the, medal, for, merit, by, president, harry, s, truman, his, daughter, mary, ellin, barrett, who, was, 15, when, she, was, at, the, opening, night, performance, of, this, is, the, army, on, broadway, remembered, that, when, her, father, who, normally, shunned, the, spotlight, appeared, in, the, second, act, in, soldier, s, garb, to, sing, oh, how, i, hate, to, get, up, in, the, morning, he, was, greeted, with, a, standing, ovation, that, lasted, 10, minutes, she, adds, that, he, was, in, his, mid, 50s, at, the, time, and, later, declared, those, years, with, the, show, were, the, most, thrilling, time, of, his, life, the, grueling, tours, berlin, did, performing, this, is, the, army, left, him, exhausted, but, when, his, longtime, close, friend, jerome, kern, who, was, the, composer, for, annie, get, your, gun, died, suddenly, producers, richard, rodgers, and, oscar, hammerstein, ii, persuaded, berlin, to, take, over, composing, the, score, what, distinguishes, berlin, is, the, brilliance, of, his, lyrics, you, can, t, get, a, man, with, a, gun, that, s, as, good, a, comic, song, as, has, ever, been, written, by, anybody, you, look, at, the, jokes, and, how, quickly, they, re, told, and, it, still, has, a, plot, to, it, it, s, sophisticated, and, very, underrated, composer, lyricist, stephen, sondheim, loosely, based, on, the, life, of, sharpshooter, annie, oakley, the, music, and, lyrics, were, written, by, berlin, with, a, book, by, herbert, fields, and, his, sister, dorothy, fields, and, directed, by, joshua, logan, at, first, berlin, refused, to, take, on, the, job, claiming, that, he, knew, nothing, about, hillbilly, music, but, the, show, ran, for, 1, 147, performances, and, became, his, most, successful, score, and, biggest, box, office, success, it, is, said, that, the, showstopper, song, there, s, no, business, like, show, business, was, almost, left, out, of, the, show, altogether, because, berlin, mistakenly, thought, that, rodgers, and, hammerstein, didn, t, like, it, however, it, became, the, ultimate, uptempo, show, tune, on, the, origin, of, another, of, the, play, s, leading, songs, logan, described, how, he, and, hammerstein, privately, discussed, wanting, another, duet, between, annie, and, frank, berlin, overheard, their, conversation, and, although, the, show, was, to, go, into, rehearsal, within, days, he, wrote, the, song, anything, you, can, do, a, few, hours, later, one, reviewer, commented, about, the, play, s, score, that, its, tough, wisecracking, lyrics, are, as, tersely, all, knowing, as, its, melody, which, is, nailed, down, in, brassy, syncopated, lines, that, have, been, copied, but, never, equaled, in, sheer, melodic, memorability, by, hundreds, of, theater, composers, ever, since, singer, and, musicologist, susannah, mccorkle, writes, that, the, score, meant, more, to, me, than, ever, now, that, i, knew, that, he, wrote, it, after, a, grueling, world, tour, and, years, of, separation, from, his, wife, and, daughters, 81, historian, and, composer, alec, wilder, says, that, the, perfection, of, the, score, when, compared, to, his, earlier, works, was, a, profound, shock, 94, apparently, the, creative, spurt, in, which, berlin, turned, out, several, songs, for, the, score, in, a, single, weekend, was, an, anomaly, according, to, his, daughter, he, usually, sweated, blood, to, write, his, songs, annie, get, your, gun, is, considered, to, be, berlin, s, best, musical, theatre, score, not, only, because, of, the, number, of, hits, it, contains, but, because, its, songs, successfully, combine, character, and, plot, development, the, song, there, s, no, business, like, show, business, became, ethel, merman, s, trademark, berlin, s, next, show, miss, liberty, 1949, was, disappointing, but, call, me, madam, 1950, starring, ethel, merman, as, sally, adams, a, washington, d, c, socialite, loosely, based, on, the, famous, washington, hostess, perle, mesta, fared, better, giving, him, his, second, greatest, success, berlin, made, two, attempts, to, write, a, musical, about, his, friend, the, colorful, addison, mizner, and, addison, s, con, man, brother, wilson, the, first, was, the, uncompleted, the, last, resorts, 1952, a, manuscript, of, act, i, is, in, the, library, of, congress, wise, guy, 1956, was, completed, but, never, produced, although, songs, have, been, published, and, recorded, on, the, unsung, irving, berlin, 1995, after, a, failed, attempt, at, retirement, in, 1962, at, the, age, of, 74, he, returned, to, broadway, with, mr, president, although, it, ran, for, eight, months, with, the, premiere, attended, by, president, john, f, kennedy, it, was, not, one, of, his, successful, plays, afterwards, berlin, officially, announced, his, retirement, and, spent, his, remaining, years, in, new, york, he, did, however, write, one, new, song, an, old, fashioned, wedding, for, the, 1966, broadway, revival, of, annie, get, your, gun, starring, ethel, merman, though, he, lived, 23, more, years, this, would, be, one, of, berlin, s, final, published, compositions, berlin, maintained, a, low, profile, through, the, last, decades, of, his, life, almost, never, appearing, in, public, after, the, late, 1960s, even, for, events, held, in, his, honor, however, he, continued, to, maintain, control, of, his, songs, through, his, own, music, publishing, company, which, remained, in, operation, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1927, his, song, blue, skies, was, featured, in, the, first, feature, length, talkie, the, jazz, singer, with, al, jolson, later, movies, such, as, top, hat, 1935, became, the, first, of, a, series, of, distinctive, film, musicals, by, berlin, starring, performers, bing, crosby, fred, astaire, judy, garland, ginger, rogers, and, alice, faye, top, hat, featured, a, brand, new, score, as, did, several, more, including, follow, the, fleet, 1936, on, the, avenue, 1937, carefree, 1938, and, second, fiddle, 1939, starting, with, alexander, s, ragtime, band, 1938, he, often, blended, new, songs, with, existing, ones, from, his, catalog, he, continued, this, process, with, the, films, holiday, inn, 1942, blue, skies, 1946, and, easter, parade, 1948, with, judy, garland, and, fred, astaire, and, there, s, no, business, like, show, business, 1954, the, 1942, film, holiday, inn, introduced, white, christmas, one, of, the, most, recorded, songs, in, history, first, sung, in, the, film, by, bing, crosby, along, with, marjorie, reynolds, whose, voice, was, dubbed, by, martha, mears, it, has, sold, over, 50, million, records, and, stayed, no, 1, on, the, pop, and, r, b, charts, for, 10, weeks, crosby, s, version, is, the, best, selling, single, of, all, time, music, critic, stephen, holden, credits, this, partly, to, the, fact, that, the, song, also, evokes, a, primal, nostalgia, a, pure, childlike, longing, for, roots, home, and, childhood, that, goes, way, beyond, the, greeting, imagery, richard, corliss, also, notes, that, the, song, was, even, more, significant, having, been, released, soon, after, america, entered, world, war, ii, connected, with, gis, in, their, first, winter, away, from, home, to, them, it, voiced, the, ache, of, separation, and, the, wistfulness, they, felt, for, the, girl, back, home, for, the, innocence, of, youth, poet, carl, sandburg, wrote, we, have, learned, to, be, a, little, sad, and, a, little, lonesome, without, being, sickly, about, it, this, feeling, is, caught, in, the, song, of, a, thousand, jukeboxes, and, tune, whistled, in, streets, and, homes, i, m, dreaming, of, a, white, christmas, when, we, sing, that, we, don, t, hate, anybody, and, there, are, things, we, love, that, we, re, going, to, have, sometimes, if, the, breaks, are, not, too, bad, against, us, way, down, under, this, latest, hit, of, his, irving, berlin, catches, us, where, we, love, peace, white, christmas, won, berlin, the, academy, award, for, best, music, in, an, original, song, one, of, seven, oscar, nominations, he, received, during, his, career, in, subsequent, years, it, was, re, recorded, and, became, a, top, 10, seller, for, numerous, artists, frank, sinatra, jo, stafford, ernest, tubb, the, ravens, and, the, drifters, it, would, also, be, the, last, time, a, berlin, song, went, to, no, 1, upon, its, release, berlin, is, the, only, academy, award, presenter, and, academy, award, winner, to, open, the, envelope, and, read, his, or, her, own, name, for, white, christmas, this, result, was, so, awkward, for, berlin, since, he, had, to, present, the, oscar, to, himself, that, the, academy, changed, the, rules, of, protocol, the, following, year, to, prevent, this, situation, from, arising, again, talking, about, irving, berlin, s, white, christmas, composer, lyricist, garrison, hintz, stated, that, although, songwriting, can, be, a, complicated, process, its, final, result, should, sound, simple, considering, the, fact, that, white, christmas, has, only, eight, sentences, in, the, entire, song, lyrically, mr, berlin, achieved, all, that, was, necessary, to, eventually, sell, over, 100, million, copies, and, capture, the, hearts, of, the, american, public, at, the, same, time, according, to, saul, bornstein, a, k, a, sol, bourne, saul, bourne, berlin, s, publishing, company, manager, it, was, a, ritual, for, berlin, to, write, a, complete, song, words, and, music, every, day, 92, berlin, said, that, he, did, not, believe, in, inspiration, and, felt, that, although, he, might, be, gifted, in, certain, areas, his, most, successful, compositions, were, the, result, of, work, he, said, that, he, did, most, of, his, work, under, pressure, he, would, typically, begin, writing, after, dinner, and, continue, until, 4, or, 5, in, the, morning, each, day, i, would, attend, rehearsals, he, said, and, at, night, write, another, song, and, bring, it, down, the, next, day, not, always, certain, about, his, own, writing, abilities, he, once, asked, a, songwriter, friend, victor, herbert, whether, he, should, study, composition, you, have, a, natural, gift, for, words, and, music, mr, herbert, told, him, learning, theory, might, help, you, a, little, but, it, could, cramp, your, style, berlin, took, his, advice, herbert, later, became, a, moving, force, behind, the, creation, of, ascap, the, american, society, of, composers, authors, and, publishers, in, 1914, berlin, joined, him, as, a, charter, member, of, the, organization, that, has, protected, the, royalties, of, composers, and, writers, ever, since, in, 1920, irving, berlin, became, a, member, of, sacem, the, french, society, of, authors, composers, and, publishers, in, later, years, berlin, emphasized, his, conviction, saying, that, it, s, the, lyrics, that, makes, a, song, a, hit, although, the, tune, of, course, is, what, makes, it, last, 234, he, played, almost, entirely, in, the, key, of, f, sharp, so, that, he, could, stay, on, the, black, keys, and, owned, three, transposing, pianos, so, as, to, change, keys, by, moving, a, lever, though, berlin, eventually, learned, how, to, produce, written, music, he, never, changed, his, method, of, dictating, songs, to, a, musical, secretary, as, a, result, wilder, says, that, many, admirers, of, the, music, of, jerome, kern, richard, rodgers, and, cole, porter, were, unlikely, to, consider, berlin, s, work, in, the, same, category, because, they, forgot, or, never, realized, that, berlin, wrote, many, popular, tunes, such, as, soft, lights, and, sweet, music, supper, time, and, cheek, to, cheek, some, are, even, more, confused, because, he, also, wrote, more, romantic, melodies, such, as, what, ll, i, do, and, always, wilder, adds, that, in, his, lyrics, as, in, his, melodies, berlin, reveals, a, constant, awareness, of, the, world, around, him, the, pulse, of, the, times, the, society, in, which, his, is, functioning, there, is, nothing, of, the, hothouse, about, his, work, urban, though, it, may, be, his, music, has, that, vitality, both, rhythmic, and, melodic, which, never, seems, to, lose, any, of, its, exuberant, freshness, it, has, that, rich, colorful, melodic, flow, which, is, ever, the, wonder, of, all, those, of, who, too, compose, songs, his, ideas, are, endless, composer, george, gershwin, 117, composer, jerome, kern, recognized, that, the, essence, of, irving, berlin, s, lyrics, was, his, faith, in, the, american, vernacular, and, was, so, profound, that, his, best, known, songs, seem, indivisible, from, the, country, s, history, and, self, image, kern, along, with, george, gershwin, richard, rodgers, oscar, hammerstein, ii, and, cole, porter, brought, together, afro, american, latin, american, rural, pop, and, european, operetta, berlin, however, did, not, follow, that, method, instead, says, music, critic, stephen, holden, berlin, s, songs, were, always, simple, exquisitely, crafted, street, songs, whose, diction, feels, so, natural, that, one, scarcely, notices, the, craft, they, seem, to, flow, straight, out, of, the, rhythms, and, inflections, of, everyday, speech, berlin, can, be, credited, with, helping, develop, jazz, music, jeffrey, magee, wrote, how, his, song, everybody, step, was, credited, by, composers, such, as, gershwin, as, one, of, the, most, important, songs, for, learning, jazz, music, berlin, achieved, this, by, using, varying, rhythms, such, as, the, conventional, rag, and, blues, rhythms, as, well, as, bringing, in, references, to, african, american, music, it, led, composer, george, gershwin, to, claim, that, he, learned, from, berlin, that, ragtime, which, later, became, jazz, was, the, only, musical, idiom, in, existence, that, could, aptly, express, america, 117, among, berlin, s, contemporaries, was, cole, porter, whose, music, style, was, often, considered, more, witty, sophisticated, dirty, according, to, musicologist, susannah, mccorkle, of, the, five, top, songwriters, only, porter, and, berlin, wrote, both, their, own, words, and, music, however, she, notes, that, porter, unlike, berlin, was, a, yale, educated, and, wealthy, midwesterner, whose, songs, were, not, successful, until, he, was, in, his, thirties, she, notes,

israel, biographer, david, leopold, adds, that, we, all, know, his, songs, they, are, all, part, of, who, we, are, berlin, inadvertently, influenced, american, law, when, his, publishing, group, sued, mad, magazine, for, copyright, infringement, in, 1961, the, humor, magazine, had, published, a, collection, of, parody, lyrics, which, it, said, could, be, sung, to, the, tune, of, many, popular,

the, 23, songs, it, adopted, an, approach, that, was, broad, enough, to, strip, the, publishers, of, their, limited, victory, regarding, the, remaining, two, songs, writing, a, unanimous, opinion, for, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, second, circuit, circuit, judge, irving, kaufman, observed, we, doubt, that, even, so, eminent, a, composer, as, plaintiff, irving, berlin, should, be, permitted, to, claim, a, property, interest, in, iambic, pentameter, the, publishers, again, appealed, but, the, u, s, supreme, court, refused, to, hear, the, appeal, allowing, the,

in, may, 1988, violinist, isaac, stern, said, the, career, of, irving, berlin, and, american, music, were, intertwined, forever, american, music, was, born, at, his, piano, while, songwriter, sammy, cahn, pointed, out, if, a, man, in, a, lifetime, of, 50, years, can, point, to, six, songs, that, are, immediately, identifiable, he, has, achieved, something, irving, berlin, can, sing, 60, that, are, immediately, identifiable, ou, couldn, t, have, a, holiday, without, his, permission, composer, douglas, moore, added, it, s, a, rare, gift, which, sets, irving, berlin, apart, from, all, other, contemporary, songwriters, it, is, a, gift, which, qualifies, him, along, with, stephen, foster, walt, whitman, vachel, lindsay, and, carl, sandburg, as, a, great, american, minstrel, he, has, caught, and, immortalized, in, his, songs, what, we, say, what, we, think, about, and, what, we, believe, ascap, s, records, show, that, 25, of, berlin, s, songs, reached, the, top, of, the, charts, and, were, re, recorded, by, dozens, of, famous, singers, over, the, years, such, as, eddie, fisher, al, jolson, bing, crosby, frank, sinatra, barbra, streisand, linda, ronstadt, rosemary, clooney, doris, day, diana, ross, nat, king, cole, and, ella, fitzgerald, in, 1924, when, berlin, was, 36, his, biography, the, story, of, irving, berlin, was, being, written, by, alexander, woollcott, in, a, letter, to, woollcott, jerome, kern, offered, what, one, writer, said, may, be, the, last, word, on, the, significance, of, irving, berlin, irving, berlin, has, no, place, in, american, music, he, is, american, music, emotionally, he, honestly, absorbs, the, vibrations, emanating, from, the, people, manners, and, life, of, his, time, and, in, turn, gives, these, impressions, back, to, the, world, simplified, clarified, and, glorified, composer, george, gershwin, 1898, 1937, also, tried, to, describe, the, importance, of, berlin, s, compositions, i, want, to, say, at, once, that, i, frankly, believe, that, irving, berlin, is, the, greatest, songwriter, that, has, ever, lived, his, songs, are, exquisite, cameos, of, perfection, and, each, one, of, them, is, as, beautiful, as, its, neighbor, irving, berlin, remains, i, think, america, s, schubert, but, apart, from, his, genuine, talent, for, song, writing, irving, berlin, has, had, a, greater, influence, upon, american, music, than, any, other, one, man, it, was, irving, berlin, who, was, the, very, first, to, have, created, a, real, inherent, american, music, irving, berlin, was, the, first, to, free, the, american, song, from, the, nauseating, sentimentality, which, had, previously, characterized, it, and, by, introducing, and, perfecting, ragtime, he, had, actually, given, us, the, first, germ, of, an, american, musical, idiom, he, had, sown, the, first, seeds, of, an, american, music, 117, the, following, list, includes, scores, mostly, produced, by, berlin, although, some, of, the, plays, using, his, songs, were, later, adapted, to, films, the, list, will, not, include, the, film, unless, he, was, the, primary, composer, denotes, films, originally, written, for, the, stage
