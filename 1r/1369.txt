corruption, efforts, helped, him, win, re, election, in, 1882, by, a, margin, greater, than, two, to, one, an, achievement, made, more, impressive, by, the, victory, that, democratic, gubernatorial,

bragged, we, achieved, a, victory, in, getting, up, a, combination, to, beat, the, blaine, nominee, for, temporary, chairman, this, needed, skill, boldness, and, energy, to, get, the, different, factions, to, come, in, to, defeat, the, common, foe, he, was, impressed, by, an, invitation, to, speak, before, an, audience, of, ten, thousand, the, largest, crowd, he, had, addressed, up, to, then,

would, support, blaine, roosevelt, replied, i, decline, to, answer, in, the, end, he, realized, he, had, to, support, blaine, to, maintain, his, role, in, the, party, and, did, so, in, a, press,

enforcement, of, civil, service, laws, the, sun, described, roosevelt, as, irrepressible, belligerent, and, enthusiastic, roosevelt, clashed, with, postmaster, general, john, wanamaker, who, handed, out, patronage, positions, to, harrison, supporters, and, roosevelt, s, attempt, to, force, out, several, postal, workers, damaged, harrison, politically, despite, roosevelt, s, support, for,

president, harrison, and, there, is, little, doubt, that, he, had, no, idea, when, he, appointed, roosevelt, that, he, would, prove, to, be, so, veritable, a, bull, in, a, china, shop, he, refused, to, remove, him, and, stood, by, him, firmly, till, the, end, of, his, term, in, 1894, reform, republicans, approached, roosevelt, about, running, for, mayor, of, new, york, again, he, declined,

scornfully, that, he, would, knuckle, down, to, politics, the, way, they, all, did, and, lived, to, respect, him, though, he, swore, at, him, as, the, one, of, them, all, who, was, stronger, than, pull, that, was, what, made, the, age, golden, that, for, the, first, time, a, moral, purpose, came, into, the, street, in, the, light, of, it, everything, was, transformed, roosevelt, made, a, habit, of, walking, officers, beats, at, night, and, early, in, the, morning, to, make, sure, that, they, were, on, duty, he, made, a, concerted, effort, to, uniformly, enforce, new, york, s, sunday,

protests, invited, to, one, large, demonstration, not, only, did, he, accept, but, he, delighted, in, the, insults, and, lampoons, directed, at, him, and, earned, goodwill, roosevelt, chose, to, defer, rather, than, split, with, his, party, as, governor, of, new, york, state, he, would, later, sign, an, act, replacing, the, police, commission, with, a, police, commissioner, in, the, 1896,

roosevelt, also, began, pressing, his, national, security, views, regarding, the, pacific, and, the, caribbean, on, mckinley, and, was, adamant, that, spain, be, ejected, from, cuba, he, explained, his, priorities, to, one, of, the, navy, s, planners, in, late, 1897, i, would, regard, war, with, spain, from, two, viewpoints, first, the, advisability, on, the, grounds, both, of, humanity, and, self, interest, of, interfering, on, behalf, of, the, cubans, and, of, taking, one, more, step, toward, the, complete, freeing, of, america, from, european, dominion, second, the, benefit, done, our, people, by, giving, them, something, to, think, of, which, is, not, material, gain, and, especially, the, benefit, done, our, military, forces, by, trying, both, the, navy, and, army, in, actual,

and, wood, were, flooded, with, applications, referred, to, by, the, press, as, the, rough, riders, it, was, one, of, many, temporary, units, active, only, during, the, war, the, regiment, trained, for, several, weeks, in, san, antonio, texas, in, his, autobiography, roosevelt, wrote, that, his, experience, with, the, new, york, national, guard, enabled, him, to, immediately, begin, teaching, basic, soldiering, skills, diversity, characterized, the, regiment, which, included, ivy, leaguers, athletes, frontiersmen, native, americans, hunters, miners, former, soldiers, tradesmen, and, sheriffs, the, rough, riders, were, part, of, the, cavalry, division, commanded, by, former, confederate, general, joseph, wheeler, roosevelt, and, his, men, landed, in, daiquir, cuba, on, june, 23, 1898, and, marched, to, siboney, wheeler, sent, the, rough, riders, on, a, parallel, road, northwest, running, along, a, ridge, up, from, the, beach, roosevelt, took, command, of, the, regiment, he, had, his, first, experience, in, combat, when, the, rough, riders, met, spanish, troops, in, a, skirmish, known, as, the, battle, of, las, guasimas, they, fought, their, way, through, spanish, resistance, and, together, with, the, regulars, forced, the, spaniards, to, abandon, their, positions, on, july, 1, in, a, combined, assault, with, the, regulars, under, roosevelt, s, leadership, the, rough, riders, became, famous, for, charges, up, kettle, hill, and, san, juan, hill, roosevelt, was, the, only, soldier, on, horseback, as, he, rode, back, and, forth, between, rifle, pits, at, the, forefront, of, the, advance, up, kettle, hill, an, advance, that, he, urged, despite, the, absence, of, orders, he, was, forced, to, walk, up, the, last, part, of, kettle, hill, because, his, horse, had, been, entangled, in, barbed, wire, the, assaults, would, become, known, as, the, battle, of, san, juan, heights, the, victories, came, at, a, cost, of, 200, killed, and, 1, 000, wounded, in, august, roosevelt, and, other, officers, demanded, the, soldiers, be, returned, home, roosevelt, recalled, san, juan, heights, as, the, great, day, of, my, life, after, returning, to, civilian, life, roosevelt, preferred, to, be, known, as, colonel, roosevelt, or, the, colonel, teddy, remained, much, more, popular, with, the, public, though, roosevelt, openly, despised, that, moniker, shortly, after, roosevelt, s, return, republican, congressman, lemuel, e, quigg, a, lieutenant, of, new, york, machine, boss, thomas, c, platt, asked, roosevelt, to, run, in, the, 1898, gubernatorial, election, prospering, politically, from, the, platt, machine, roosevelt, s, rise, to, power, was, marked, by, the, pragmatic, decisions, of, platt, who, disliked, roosevelt, platt, feared, roosevelt, would, oppose, his, interests, in, office, and, was, reluctant, to, propel, roosevelt, to, the, forefront, of, national, politics, but, needed, a, strong, candidate, due, to, the, unpopularity, of, the, incumbent, republican, governor, frank, s, black, roosevelt, agreed, to, become, the, nominee, and, to, try, not, to, make, war, with, the, republican, establishment, once, in, office, roosevelt, defeated, black, in, the, republican, caucus, and, faced, democrat, augustus, van, wyck, a, well, respected, judge, in, the, general, election, roosevelt, campaigned, on, his, war, record, winning, by, just, 1, as, governor, roosevelt, learned, about, economic, issues, and, political, techniques, that, proved, valuable, in, his, presidency, he, studied, the, problems, of, trusts, monopolies, labor, relations, and, conservation, g, wallace, chessman, argues, that, roosevelt, s, program, rested, firmly, upon, the, concept, of, the, square, deal, by, a, neutral, state, the, rules, for, the, square, deal, were, honesty, in, public, affairs, an, equitable, sharing, of, privilege, and, responsibility, and, subordination, of, party, and, local, concerns, to, the, interests, of, the, state, at, large, by, holding, twice, daily, press, conferences, an, innovation, roosevelt, remained, connected, with, his, middle, class, base, roosevelt, successfully, pushed, the, ford, franchise, tax, bill, which, taxed, public, franchises, granted, by, the, state, and, controlled, by, corporations, declaring, that, a, corporation, which, derives, its, powers, from, the, state, should, pay, to, the, state, a, just, percentage, of, its, earnings, as, a, return, for, the, privileges, it, enjoys, he, rejected, platt, worries, that, this, approached, bryanite, socialism, explaining, that, without, it, new, york, voters, might, get, angry, and, adopt, public, ownership, of, streetcar, lines, and, other, franchises, power, to, make, appointments, to, policy, making, positions, was, a, key, role, for, the, governor, platt, insisted, he, be, consulted, on, major, appointments, roosevelt, appeared, to, comply, but, then, made, his, own, decisions, historians, marvel, that, roosevelt, managed, to, appoint, so, many, first, rate, people, with, platt, s, approval, he, even, enlisted, platt, s, help, in, securing, reform, such, as, in, spring, 1899, when, platt, pressured, state, senators, to, vote, for, a, civil, service, bill, that, the, secretary, of, the, civil, service, reform, association, called, superior, to, any, civil, service, statute, heretofore, secured, in, america, chessman, argues, that, as, governor, roosevelt, developed, the, principles, that, shaped, his, presidency, especially, insistence, upon, the, public, responsibility, of, large, corporations, publicity, as, a, first, remedy, for, trusts, regulation, of, railroad, rates, mediation, of, the, conflict, of, capital, and, labor, conservation, of, natural, resources, and, protection, of, the, poor, roosevelt, sought, to, position, himself, against, the, excesses, of, large, corporations, and, radical, movements, as, chief, executive, of, the, most, populous, state, roosevelt, was, widely, considered, a, potential, presidential, candidate, and, supporters, such, as, william, allen, white, encouraged, him, to, run, roosevelt, had, no, interest, in, challenging, mckinley, for, the, nomination, in, 1900, and, was, denied, his, preferred, post, of, secretary, of, war, as, his, term, progressed, roosevelt, pondered, a, 1904, run, but, was, uncertain, about, whether, he, should, seek, re, election, as, governor, in, 1900, in, november, 1899, vice, president, garret, hobart, died, leaving, an, open, spot, on, the, 1900, republican, national, ticket, though, henry, cabot, lodge, and, others, urged, him, to, run, for, vice, president, in, 1900, roosevelt, issued, a, public, statement, saying, that, he, would, not, accept, the, nomination, eager, to, be, rid, of, roosevelt, platt, nonetheless, began, a, newspaper, campaign, in, favor, of, roosevelt, s, nomination, roosevelt, attended, the, 1900, republican, national, convention, as, a, state, delegate, and, struck, a, bargain, with, platt, roosevelt, would, accept, the, nomination, if, the, convention, offered, it, to, him, but, would, otherwise, serve, another, term, as, governor, platt, asked, pennsylvania, party, boss, matthew, quay, to, lead, the, campaign, for, roosevelt, s, nomination, and, quay, outmaneuvered, mark, hanna, at, the, convention, to, put, roosevelt, on, the, ticket, roosevelt, won, the, nomination, unanimously, roosevelt, s, vice, presidential, campaigning, proved, highly, energetic, and, a, match, for, democratic, presidential, nominee, william, jennings, bryan, s, barnstorming, style, in, a, whirlwind, campaign, that, displayed, his, energy, to, the, public, roosevelt, made, 480, stops, in, 23, states, he, denounced, the, radicalism, of, bryan, contrasting, it, with, the, heroism, of, those, who, won, the, war, against, spain, bryan, had, strongly, supported, the, war, itself, but, he, denounced, the, annexation, of, the, philippines, as, imperialism, roosevelt, countered, that, it, was, best, for, the, filipinos, to, have, stability, and, the, americans, to, have, a, proud, place, in, the, world, the, voters, gave, mckinley, an, even, larger, victory, than, that, which, he, had, achieved, in, 1896, roosevelt, took, office, as, vice, president, in, march, 1901, the, office, was, a, powerless, sinecure, and, did, not, suit, roosevelt, s, aggressive, temperament, roosevelt, s, six, months, as, vice, president, were, uneventful, and, boring, for, a, man, of, action, he, had, no, power, he, presided, over, the, senate, for, a, mere, four, days, before, it, adjourned, on, september, 2, 1901, roosevelt, first, publicized, an, aphorism, that, thrilled, his, supporters, speak, softly, and, carry, a, big, stick, and, you, will, go, far, on, september, 6, 1901, president, mckinley, was, attending, the, pan, american, exposition, in, buffalo, new, york, when, he, was, shot, by, anarchist, leon, czolgosz, roosevelt, vacationing, in, isle, la, motte, vermont, traveled, to, buffalo, to, visit, mckinley, in, the, hospital, when, mckinley, seemed, to, recover, roosevelt, resumed, his, vacation, when, mckinley, s, condition, worsened, roosevelt, rushed, back, to, buffalo, he, was, in, north, creek, when, he, learned, of, mckinley, s, death, on, september, 14, roosevelt, then, continued, to, buffalo, and, was, sworn, in, as, the, 26th, president, at, the, ansley, wilcox, house, mckinley, s, supporters, were, uneasy, about, roosevelt, with, ohio, senator, mark, hanna, particularly, bitter, given, his, strong, opposition, at, the, convention, although, roosevelt, assured, party, leaders, that, he, would, adhere, to, mckinley, s, policies, and, retained, his, cabinet, he, sought, to, establish, himself, as, the, party, s, leader, and, position, himself, for, the, 1904, election, shortly, after, taking, office, roosevelt, invited, booker, t, washington, to, dinner, at, the, white, house, sparking, a, bitter, reaction, across, the, heavily, segregated, south, while, roosevelt, initially, planned, more, dinners, with, washington, he, later, avoided, further, invitations, in, favor, of, business, appoinrments, to, retain, political, support, in, the, white, south, roosevelt, was, hailed, as, the, trust, buster, for, his, aggressive, use, of, the, 1890, sherman, antitrust, act, compared, to, his, predecessors, he, viewed, big, business, as, essential, to, the, american, economy, prosecuting, only, bad, trusts, that, restrained, trade, and, charged, unfair, prices, roosevelt, brought, 44, antitrust, suits, breaking, up, the, northern, securities, company, the, largest, railroad, monopoly, and, regulating, standard, oil, the, largest, oil, company, his, predecessors, benjamin, harrison, grover, cleveland, and, william, mckinley, had, together, prosecuted, only, 18, antitrust, violations, after, winning, large, majorities, in, the, 1902, elections, roosevelt, proposed, creating, the, united, states, department, of, commerce, and, labor, which, included, the, bureau, of, corporations, congress, was, receptive, to, the, department, but, skeptical, of, the, antitrust, powers, roosevelt, wanted, within, the, bureau, roosevelt, appealed, to, the, public, pressuring, congress, which, overwhelmingly, passed, his, version, of, the, bill, house, speaker, joseph, gurney, cannon, commented, on, roosevelt, s, desire, for, executive, branch, control, that, fellow, at, the, other, end, of, the, avenue, wants, everything, from, the, birth, of, christ, to, the, death, of, the, devil, biographer, brands, notes, even, his, friends, occasionally, wondered, whether, there, wasn, t, any, custom, or, practice, too, minor, for, him, to, try, to, regulate, update, or, otherwise, improve, roosevelt, s, willingness, to, exercise, power, extended, to, attempted, rule, changes, in, american, football, forcing, retention, of, martial, arts, classes, at, the, u, s, naval, academy, revising, disciplinary, rules, altering, the, design, of, a, disliked, coin, and, ordering, simplified, spellings, for, 300, words, though, he, rescinded, the, latter, after, ridicule, from, the, press, and, a, house, protest, in, may, 1902, anthracite, coal, miners, went, on, strike, threatening, a, national, energy, shortage, after, threatening, the, coal, operators, with, federal, troops, roosevelt, won, their, agreement, to, dispute, arbitration, by, a, commission, stopping, the, strike, the, accord, with, j, p, morgan, resulted, in, miners, getting, more, pay, for, fewer, hours, but, no, union, recognition, roosevelt, said, my, action, on, labor, should, always, be, considered, in, connection, with, my, action, as, regards, capital, and, both, are, reducible, to, my, favorite, formula, a, square, deal, for, every, man, he, was, the, first, president, to, help, settle, a, labor, dispute, during, roosevelt, s, second, year, in, office, corruption, was, uncovered, in, the, indian, service, the, united, states, general, land, office, and, the, post, office, department, he, prosecuted, corrupt, indian, agents, who, had, cheated, native, american, tribes, out, of, land, parcels, land, fraud, and, speculation, involving, oregon, timberlands, led, to, him, and, ethan, a, hitchcock, forcing, general, land, office, commissioner, binger, hermann, from, office, in, november, 1902, special, prosecutor, francis, j, heney, obtained, 146, indictments, in, the, oregon, land, office, bribery, ring, roosevelt, also, prosecuted, 44, postal, employees, on, charges, of, bribery, and, fraud, historians, agree, he, moved, quickly, and, decisively, to, address, misconduct, in, his, administration, merchants, complained, that, some, railroad, rates, were, too, high, in, the, 1906, hepburn, act, roosevelt, sought, to, give, the, interstate, commerce, commission, icc, the, power, to, regulate, rates, but, the, senate, led, by, conservative, nelson, aldrich, resisted, roosevelt, worked, with, democratic, senator, benjamin, tillman, to, pass, the, bill, they, ultimately, reached, a, compromise, that, gave, the, icc, the, power, to, replace, existing, rates, with, just, and, reasonable, maximum, rates, allowing, railroads, to, appeal, to, federal, courts, on, what, was, reasonable, the, hepburn, act, also, granted, the, icc, regulatory, power, over, pipeline, fees, storage, contracts, and, other, aspects, of, railroad, operations, roosevelt, responded, to, public, outrage, over, abuses, in, the, food, packing, industry, by, pushing, congress, to, pass, the, meat, inspection, act, of, 1906, and, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, conservatives, initially, opposed, the, bill, but, upton, sinclair, s, the, jungle, published, in, 1906, galvanized, support, for, reform, the, meat, inspection, act, banned, misleading, labels, and, preservatives, with, harmful, chemicals, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, banned, impure, or, falsely, labeled, food, and, drugs, from, being, made, sold, and, shipped, roosevelt, served, as, honorary, president, of, the, american, school, hygiene, association, from, 1907, to, 1908, and, convened, the, first, white, house, conference, on, the, care, of, dependent, children, in, 1909, roosevelt, was, proudest, of, his, work, in, conserving, natural, resources, and, extending, federal, protection, to, land, and, wildlife, he, worked, closely, with, interior, secretary, james, rudolph, garfield, and, chief, of, the, united, states, forest, service, gifford, pinchot, to, enact, a, series, of, conservation, programs, that, met, resistance, from, western, congress, members, such, as, charles, william, fulton, nonetheless, roosevelt, established, the, united, states, forest, service, signed, the, creation, of, five, national, parks, and, signed, the, 1906, antiquities, act, under, which, he, proclaimed, 18, new, u, s, national, monuments, he, also, established, the, first, 51, bird, reserves, four, game, preserves, and, 150, national, forests, the, area, of, the, united, states, he, placed, under, public, protection, totals, approximately, 230, million, acres, 930, 000, square, kilometers, roosevelt, was, the, first, honorary, member, of, the, camp, fire, club, of, america, roosevelt, extensively, used, executive, orders, to, protect, forest, and, wildlife, lands, during, his, presidency, by, the, end, of, his, second, term, roosevelt, used, executive, orders, to, reserve, 150, million, acres, 600, 000, square, kilometers, of, forestry, land, roosevelt, was, unapologetic, about, his, use, of, executive, orders, to, protect, the, environment, despite, congress, s, perception, that, he, was, encroaching, on, too, many, lands, eventually, senator, charles, fulton, attached, an, amendment, to, an, agricultural, appropriations, bill, preventing, the, president, from, reserving, further, land, before, signing, the, bill, roosevelt, established, an, additional, 21, forest, reserves, waiting, until, the, last, minute, to, sign, it, into, law, in, total, roosevelt, established, 121, forest, reserves, in, 31, states, through, executive, orders, roosevelt, issued, 1, 081, executive, orders, more, than, any, previous, president, except, grover, cleveland, 253, the, first, 25, presidents, issued, a, total, of, 1, 262, executive, orders, in, 1907, roosevelt, faced, the, greatest, domestic, economic, crisis, since, the, panic, of, 1893, wall, street, s, stock, market, entered, a, slump, in, early, 1907, and, many, investors, blamed, roosevelt, s, regulatory, policies, for, the, decline, in, stock, prices, roosevelt, ultimately, helped, calm, the, crisis, by, meeting, with, the, leaders, of, u, s, steel, on, november, 4, 1907, and, approving, their, plan, to, purchase, a, tennessee, steel, company, near, bankruptcy, its, failure, would, ruin, a, major, new, york, bank, however, in, august, roosevelt, had, exploded, in, anger, at, the, super, rich, for, their, economic, malfeasance, calling, them, malefactors, of, great, wealth, in, a, major, speech, the, puritan, spirit, and, the, regulation, of, corporations, trying, to, restore, confidence, he, blamed, the, crisis, primarily, on, europe, but, then, after, saluting, the, unbending, rectitude, of, the, puritans, he, went, on, it, may, well, be, that, the, determination, of, the, government, to, punish, certain, malefactors, of, great, wealth, has, been, responsible, for, something, of, the, trouble, at, least, to, the, extent, of, having, caused, these, men, to, combine, to, bring, about, as, much, financial, stress, as, possible, in, order, to, discredit, the, policy, of, the, government, and, thereby, secure, a, reversal, of, that, policy, so, that, they, may, enjoy, unmolested, the, fruits, of, their, own, evil, doing, regarding, the, very, wealthy, roosevelt, privately, scorned, their, entire, unfitness, to, govern, the, country, and, the, lasting, damage, they, do, by, much, of, what, they, think, are, the, legitimate, big, business, operations, of, the, day, the, american, annexation, of, hawaii, in, 1898, was, stimulated, in, part, by, fear, that, japan, would, dominate, or, seize, the, hawaiian, republic, similarly, germany, was, the, alternative, to, american, takeover, of, the, philippines, in, 1900, and, tokyo, strongly, preferred, the, u, s, to, take, over, as, the, u, s, became, a, naval, world, power, it, needed, to, find, a, way, to, avoid, a, military, confrontation, in, the, pacific, with, japan, in, the, 1890s, roosevelt, had, been, an, ardent, imperialist, and, vigorously, defended, the, permanent, acquisition, of, the, philippines, in, the, 1900, campaign, after, the, local, insurrection, ended, in, 1902, roosevelt, wished, to, have, a, strong, u, s, presence, in, the, region, as, a, symbol, of, democratic, values, but, he, did, not, envision, any, new, acquisitions, one, of, roosevelt, s, priorities, was, the, maintenance, of, friendly, relations, with, japan, from, 1904, to, 1905, japan, and, russia, were, at, war, both, sides, asked, roosevelt, to, mediate, a, peace, conference, held, successfully, in, portsmouth, new, hampshire, roosevelt, won, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, his, efforts, though, he, proclaimed, that, the, united, states, would, be, neutral, during, the, russo, japanese, war, roosevelt, secretly, favored, imperial, japan, to, emerge, victorious, against, the, russian, empire, in, california, anti, japanese, hostility, was, growing, and, tokyo, protested, roosevelt, negotiated, a, gentleman, s, agreement, in, 1907, it, ended, explicit, discrimination, against, the, japanese, and, japan, agreed, not, to, allow, unskilled, immigrants, into, the, united, states, the, great, white, fleet, of, american, battleships, visited, japan, in, 1908, roosevelt, intended, to, emphasize, the, superiority, of, the, american, fleet, over, the, smaller, japanese, navy, but, instead, of, resentment, the, visitors, arrived, to, a, joyous, welcome, this, goodwill, facilitated, the, root, takahira, agreement, of, november, 1908, which, reaffirmed, the, status, quo, of, japanese, control, of, korea, and, american, control, of, the, philippines, following, the, boxer, rebellion, foreign, powers, including, the, united, states, required, china, to, pay, indemnities, as, part, of, the, boxer, protocol, in, 1908, roosevelt, appropriated, these, indemnities, for, the, boxer, indemnity, scholarships, which, funded, tens, of, thousands, of, chinese, students, to, study, in, the, u, s, over, the, next, 40, years, 91, success, in, the, war, against, spain, and, the, new, empire, plus, having, the, largest, economy, in, the, world, meant, that, the, united, states, had, emerged, as, a, world, power, roosevelt, searched, for, ways, to, win, recognition, for, the, position, abroad, he, also, played, a, major, role, in, mediating, the, first, moroccan, crisis, by, calling, the, algeciras, conference, which, averted, war, between, france, and, germany, roosevelt, s, presidency, saw, the, strengthening, of, ties, with, great, britain, the, great, rapprochement, had, begun, with, british, support, of, the, united, states, during, the, spanish, american, war, and, it, continued, as, britain, withdrew, its, fleet, from, the, caribbean, in, favor, of, directing, most, of, its, attention, to, the, rising, german, naval, threat, in, 1901, britain, and, the, u, s, signed, the, hay, pauncefote, treaty, abrogating, the, clayton, bulwer, treaty, which, had, prevented, the, u, s, from, constructing, a, canal, connecting, the, pacific, and, the, atlantic, ocean, the, long, standing, alaska, boundary, dispute, was, settled, on, terms, favorable, to, the, u, s, as, roosevelt, later, put, it, this, settled, the, last, serious, trouble, between, the, british, empire, and, ourselves, as, president, roosevelt, primarily, directed, the, nation, s, overseas, ambitions, towards, the, caribbean, especially, locations, that, had, a, bearing, on, the, defense, of, his, pet, project, the, panama, canal, roosevelt, also, increased, the, size, of, the, navy, and, by, the, end, of, his, second, term, the, u, s, had, more, battleships, than, any, country, other, than, britain, the, panama, canal, when, it, opened, in, 1914, allowed, the, u, s, navy, to, rapidly, move, back, and, forth, from, the, pacific, to, the, caribbean, to, european, waters, in, december, 1902, the, germans, british, and, italians, blockaded, the, ports, of, venezuela, to, force, the, repayment, of, delinquent, loans, roosevelt, was, particularly, concerned, about, the, motives, of, german, emperor, wilhelm, ii, he, succeeded, in, getting, the, three, nations, to, agree, to, arbitration, by, tribunal, at, the, hague, and, successfully, defused, the, crisis, the, latitude, granted, to, the, europeans, by, the, arbiters, was, in, part, responsible, for, the, roosevelt, corollary, to, the, monroe, doctrine, which, the, president, issued, in, 1904, chronic, wrongdoing, or, an, impotence, which, results, in, a, general, loosening, of, the, ties, of, civilized, society, may, in, america, as, elsewhere, ultimately, require, intervention, by, some, civilized, nation, and, in, the, western, hemisphere, the, adherence, of, the, united, states, to, the, monroe, doctrine, may, force, the, united, states, however, reluctantly, in, flagrant, cases, of, such, wrongdoing, or, impotence, to, the, exercise, of, an, international, police, power, two, possible, routes, for, an, isthmus, canal, in, central, america, were, under, consideration, through, nicaragua, and, through, panama, which, was, then, a, rebellious, district, within, colombia, roosevelt, persuaded, congress, to, approve, the, panamanian, alternative, and, a, treaty, was, approved, only, to, be, rejected, by, the, colombian, government, when, the, panamanians, learned, of, this, a, rebellion, followed, was, supported, by, roosevelt, and, succeeded, a, treaty, with, the, new, panama, government, for, construction, of, the, canal, was, reached, in, 1903, roosevelt, received, criticism, for, paying, the, bankrupt, panama, canal, company, and, the, new, panama, canal, company, 40, 000, 000, equivalent, to, 13, 56, billion, in, 2023, for, the, rights, and,

company, engineer, influenced, roosevelt, in, choosing, the, panama, route, for, the, canal, over, the, nicaragua, route, roosevelt, denied, charges, of, corruption, in, january, 1909, roosevelt, in, an, unprecedented, move, brought, criminal, libel, charges, against, the, new, york, world, and, the, indianapolis, news, known, as, the, roosevelt, panama, libel, cases, both, cases, were, dismissed, by, u, s, district, courts, and, on, january, 3, 1911, the, u, s, supreme, court, upheld, the, lower, courts, rulings, historians, are, sharply, critical, of, roosevelt, s, criminal, prosecutions, of, the, newspapers, but, are, divided, on, whether, actual, corruption, took, place, in, 1906, following, a, disputed, election, an, insurrection, ensued, in, cuba, roosevelt, sent, taft, the, secretary, of, war, to, monitor, the, situation, he, was, convinced, that, he, had, the, authority, to, unilaterally, authorize, taft, to, deploy, marines, if, necessary, without, congressional, approval, examining, the, work, of, numerous, scholars, ricard, reports, that, the, most, striking, evolution, in, the, twenty, first, century, historiography, of, theodore, roosevelt, is, the, switch, from, a, partial, arraignment, of, the, imperialist, to, a, quasi, unanimous, celebration, of, the, master, diplomatist, have, underlined, cogently, roosevelt, s, exceptional, statesmanship, in, the, construction, of, the, nascent, twentieth, century, special, relationship, the, twenty, sixth, president, s, reputation, as, a, brilliant, diplomatist, and, real, politician, has, undeniably, reached, new, heights, in, the, twenty, first, century, yet, his, philippine, policy, still, prompts, criticism, on, november, 6, 1906, roosevelt, was, the, first, president, to, depart, the, continental, united, states, on, an, official, diplomatic, trip, roosevelt, made, a, 17, day, trip, to, panama, and, puerto, rico, he, visited, the, panama, canal, worksite, and, attended, diplomatic, receptions, in, both, panama, and, puerto, rico, building, on, mckinley, s, effective, use, of, the, press, roosevelt, made, the, white, house, the, center, of, news, every, day, providing, interviews, and, photo, opportunities, after, noticing, the, reporters, huddled, outside, the, white, house, in, the, rain, one, day, he, gave, them, their, own, room, inside, effectively, inventing, the, presidential, press, briefing, the, grateful, press, with, unprecedented, access, to, the, white, house, rewarded, roosevelt, with, ample, coverage, aside, from, the, roosevelt, panama, libel, cases, roosevelt, normally, enjoyed, very, close, relationships, with, the, press, while, out, of, office, he, made, a, living, as, a, writer, and, magazine, editor, he, loved, talking, with, intellectuals, authors, and, writers, he, drew, the, line, however, at, expos, oriented, scandal, mongering, journalists, who, during, his, term, sent, magazine, subscriptions, soaring, by, their, attacks, on, corrupt, politicians, mayors, and, corporations, roosevelt, himself, was, not, usually, a, target, but, a, speech, of, his, from, 1906, coined, the, term, muckraker, for, unscrupulous, journalists, making, wild, charges, with, the, waning, of, thomas, platt, s, power, roosevelt, faced, little, effective, opposition, for, the, 1904, nomination, in, deference, to, mark, hanna, s, conservative, loyalists, roosevelt, at, first, offered, the, party, chairmanship, to, cornelius, bliss, but, he, declined, roosevelt, turned, to, his, own, man, george, b, cortelyou, of, new, york, the, first, secretary, of, commerce, and, labor, to, buttress, his, hold, on, the, party, s, nomination, roosevelt, made, it, clear, that, anyone, opposing, cortelyou, would, be, considered, opposing, the, president, the, president, secured, his, own, nomination, but, his, preferred, vice, presidential, running, mate, robert, r, hitt, was, not, nominated, senator, charles, warren, fairbanks, of, indiana, a, favorite, of, conservatives, gained, the, nomination, while, roosevelt, followed, the, tradition, of, incumbents, in, not, actively, campaigning, on, the, stump, he, sought, to, control, the, campaign, s, message, through, specific, instructions, to, cortelyou, he, also, attempted, to, manage, the, press, s, release, of, white, house, statements, by, forming, the, ananias, club, any, journalist, who, repeated, a, statement, made, by, the, president, without, approval, was, penalized, by, restriction, of, further, access, the, democratic, party, s, nominee, in, 1904, was, alton, brooks, parker, democratic, newspapers, charged, that, republicans, were, extorting, large, campaign, contributions, from, corporations, putting, ultimate, responsibility, on, roosevelt, himself, roosevelt, denied, corruption, while, at, the, same, time, ordering, cortelyou, to, return, 100, 000, equivalent, to, 3, 4, million, in, 2023, of, a, campaign, contribution, from, standard, oil, parker, said, that, roosevelt, was, accepting, corporate, donations, to, keep, damaging, information, from, the, bureau, of, corporations, from, going, public, roosevelt, strongly, denied, parker, s, charge, and, responded, that, he, would, go, into, the, presidency, unhampered, by, any, pledge, promise, or, understanding, of, any, kind, sort, or, description, allegations, from, parker, and, the, democrats, however, had, little, impact, on, the, election, as, roosevelt, promised, to, give, every, american, a, square, deal, roosevelt, won, 56, of, the, popular, vote, to, parker, s, 38, and, won, the, electoral, college, vote, 336, to, 140, before, his, inauguration, ceremony, roosevelt, declared, that, he, would, not, serve, another, term, democrats, would, continue, to, charge, roosevelt, and, the, republicans, of, being, influenced, by, corporate, donations, as, his, second, term, progressed, roosevelt, moved, to, the, left, of, his, republican, party, base, and, called, for, a, series, of, reforms, most, of, which, congress, failed, to, pass, roosevelt, s, influence, waned, as, he, approached, the, end, of, his, second, term, as, his, promise, to, forego, a, third, term, made, him, a, lame, duck, and, his, concentration, of, power, provoked, a, backlash, from, many, congressmen, he, sought, a, national, incorporation, law, called, for, a, federal, income, tax, despite, the, supreme, court, s, ruling, in, pollock, v, farmers, loan, trust, co, and, an, inheritance, tax, roosevelt, called, for, limits, on, the, use, of, court, injunctions, against, labor, unions, during, strikes, injunctions, were, a, powerful, weapon, that, mostly, helped, business, he, wanted, an, employee, liability, law, for, industrial, injuries, pre, empting, state, laws, and, an, eight, hour, work, day, for, federal, employees, in, other, areas, he, also, sought, a, postal, savings, system, to, provide, competition, for, local, banks, and, he, asked, for, campaign, reform, laws, the, election, of, 1904, continued, to, be, a, source, of, contention, between, republicans, and, democrats, a, congressional, investigation, in, 1905, revealed, that, corporate, executives, donated, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, in, 1904, to, the, republican, national, committee, in, 1908, a, month, before, the, general, presidential, election, governor, charles, n, haskell, of, oklahoma, former, democratic, treasurer, said, that, senators, beholden, to, standard, oil, lobbied, roosevelt, in, the, summer, of, 1904, to, authorize, the, leasing, of, indian, oil, lands, by, standard, oil, subsidiaries, he, said, roosevelt, overruled, his, secretary, of, the, interior, ethan, a, hitchcock, and, granted, a, pipeline, franchise, to, run, through, the, osage, lands, to, the, prairie, oil, and, gas, company, the, new, york, sun, made, a, similar, accusation, and, said, that, standard, oil, a, refinery, that, financially, benefited, from, the, pipeline, had, contributed, 150, 000, to, the, republicans, in, 1904, equivalent, to, 5, 1, million, in, 2023, after, roosevelt, s, alleged, reversal, allowing, the, pipeline, franchise, roosevelt, branded, haskell, s, allegation, as, a, lie, pure, and, simple, roosevelt, s, rhetoric, was, characterized, by, an, intense, moralism, of, personal, righteousness, the, tone, was, typified, by, his, denunciation, of, predatory, wealth, in, a, message, he, sent, congress, in, january, 1908, calling, for, passage, of, new, labor, laws, predatory, wealth, of, the, wealth, accumulated, on, a, giant, scale, by, all, forms, of, iniquity, ranging, from, the, oppression, of, wageworkers, to, unfair, and, unwholesome, methods, of, crushing, out, competition, and, to, defrauding, the, public, by, stock, jobbing, and, the, manipulation, of, securities, certain, wealthy, men, of, this, stamp, whose, conduct, should, be, abhorrent, to, every, man, of, ordinarily, decent, conscience, and, who, commit, the, hideous, wrong, of, teaching, our, young, men, that, phenomenal, business, success, must, ordinarily, be, based, on, dishonesty, have, during, the, last, few, months, made, it, apparent, that, they, have, banded, together, to, work, for, a, reaction, their, endeavor, is, to, overthrow, and, discredit, all, who, honestly, administer, the, law, to, prevent, any, additional, legislation, which, would, check, and, restrain, them, and, to, secure, if, possible, a, freedom, from, all, restraint, which, will, permit, every, unscrupulous, wrongdoer, to, do, what, he, wishes, unchecked, provided, he, has, enough, money, the, methods, by, which, the, standard, oil, people, and, those, engaged, in, the, other, combinations, of, which, i, have, spoken, above, have, achieved, great, fortunes, can, only, be, justified, by, the, advocacy, of, a, system, of, morality, which, would, also, justify, every, form, of, criminality, on, the, part, of, a, labor, union, and, every, form, of, violence, corruption, and, fraud, from, murder, to, bribery, and, ballot, box, stuffing, in, politics, roosevelt, enjoyed, being, president, but, believed, limited, terms, provided, a, check, against, dictatorship, he, decided, to, honor, his, 1904, pledge, not, to, run, for, a, third, term, though, he, favored, secretary, of, state, elihu, root, as, his, successor, root, s, ill, health, made, him, unsuitable, new, york, governor, charles, evans, hughes, was, a, strong, candidate, and, shared, roosevelt, s, progressivism, but, roosevelt, considered, him, too, independent, he, settled, on, his, secretary, of, war, william, howard, taft, who, had, been, his, friend, since, 1890, and, consistently, supported, roosevelt, s, policies, roosevelt, was, determined, to, install, the, successor, of, his, choice, and, wrote, to, taft, dear, will, do, you, want, any, action, about, those, federal, officials, i, will, break, their, necks, with, the, utmost, cheerfulness, if, you, say, the, word, just, weeks, later, he, branded, as, false, and, malicious, the, charge, he, was, using, the, offices, at, his, disposal, to, favor, taft, at, the, 1908, republican, convention, many, chanted, four, years, more, of, a, roosevelt, presidency, but, taft, won, the, nomination, after, henry, cabot, lodge, made, it, clear, roosevelt, was, not, interested, in, the, 1908, election, taft, easily, defeated, democratic, nominee, william, jennings, bryan, taft, promoted, progressivism, emphasizing, the, rule, of, law, he, preferred, that, judges, rather, than, politicians, make, decisions, about, fairness, however, taft, proved, to, be, a, less, adroit, politician, than, roosevelt, lacking, the, energy, personal, magnetism, and, public, support, that, made, roosevelt, so, formidable, when, roosevelt, realized, lowering, the, tariff, would, create, severe, tensions, inside, the, republican, party, he, stopped, talking, about, it, taft, ignoring, the, risks, tackled, the, tariff, boldly, resulting, in, the, payne, aldrich, tariff, of, 1909, which, alienated, reformers, on, all, sides, while, the, crisis, was, building, inside, the, party, roosevelt, was, touring, africa, and, europe, allowing, taft, space, in, march, 1909, the, ex, president, left, for, the, smithsonian, roosevelt, african, expedition, roosevelt, s, party, landed, in, mombasa, in, east, africa, and, traveled, to, the, belgian, congo, before, following, the, nile, river, to, khartoum, in, modern, sudan, well, financed, by, andrew, carnegie, and, by, his, own, writings, roosevelt, s, party, hunted, for, specimens, for, the, smithsonian, institution, and, american, museum, of, natural, history, the, group, led, by, hunter, tracker, r, j, cunninghame, included, scientists, from, the, smithsonian, and, was, joined, by, frederick, selous, famous, big, game, hunter, and, explorer, participants, included, kermit, roosevelt, edgar, alexander, mearns, edmund, heller, and, john, alden, loring, the, team, killed, or, trapped, 11, 400, animals, from, insects, and, moles, to, hippopotamuses, and, elephants, the, 1, 000, large, animals, included, 512, big, game, animals, including, six, rare, white, rhinos, tons, of, salted, carcasses, and, skins, were, shipped, to, washington, it, took, years, to, mount, them, all, regarding, the, large, number, taken, roosevelt, said, i, can, be, condemned, only, if, the, existence, of, the, national, museum, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, and, all, similar, zoological, institutions, are, to, be, condemned, he, wrote, a, detailed, account, of, the, trip, in, african, game, trails, after, his, safari, roosevelt, traveled, north, to, embark, on, a, tour, of, europe, stopping, first, in, egypt, he, commented, favorably, on, british, rule, stating, egypt, was, not, yet, ready, for, independence, he, refused, a, meeting, with, the, pope, due, to, a, dispute, over, a, group, of, methodists, active, in, rome, he, met, with, emperor, franz, joseph, of, austria, hungary, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, king, george, v, of, great, britain, and, other, leaders, in, oslo, roosevelt, delivered, a, speech, calling, for, limitations, on, naval, armaments, a, strengthening, of, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, and, the, creation, of, a, league, of, peace, among, the, world, powers, he, delivered, the, romanes, lecture, at, oxford, where, he, denounced, those, who, sought, parallels, between, the, evolution, of, animal, life, and, the, development, of, society, though, roosevelt, attempted, to, avoid, domestic, politics, he, quietly, met, with, gifford, pinchot, who, related, his, disappointment, with, the, taft, administration, pinchot, had, been, forced, to, resign, as, head, of, the, forest, service, after, clashing, with, taft, s, interior, secretary, richard, ballinger, roosevelt, returned, to, the, us, in, june, 1910, four, months, later, roosevelt, became, the, first, us, president, to, fly, in, a, plane, staying, aloft, for, 4, minutes, in, a, wright, brothers, designed, craft, roosevelt, relied, on, carnegie, for, financing, his, expedition, in, return, carnegie, asked, the, ex, president, to, mediate, the, growing, conflict, between, the, cousins, who, ruled, britain, and, germany, roosevelt, started, to, but, the, scheme, collapsed, when, king, edward, vii, suddenly, died, david, nasaw, argues, roosevelt, systematically, deceived, and, manipulated, carnegie, and, held, the, elderly, man, in, contempt, roosevelt, had, attempted, to, refashion, taft, into, a, copy, of, himself, but, recoiled, as, taft, began, to, display, his, individuality, he, was, offended, on, election, night, when, taft, indicated, his, success, had, been, possible, not, just, through, roosevelt, but, also, taft, s, half, brother, charles, p, taft, roosevelt, was, further, alienated, when, taft, did, not, consult, him, about, cabinet, appointments, roosevelt, and, other, progressives, were, ideologically, dissatisfied, over, taft, s, conservation, policies, and, his, handling, of, the, tariff, when, he, concentrated, power, with, conservative, party, leaders, in, congress, others, have, argued, that, taft, abided, by, the, goals, and, procedures, of, the, square, deal, promoted, by, roosevelt, in, his, first, term, the, problem, was, roosevelt, and, the, more, radical, progressives, had, moved, on, to, more, aggressive, goals, such, as, curbing, the, judiciary, which, taft, rejected, roosevelt, urged, progressives, to, take, control, of, the, republican, party, and, to, avoid, splitting, it, in, a, way, that, would, hand, the, presidency, to, the, democrats, in, 1912, to, that, end, roosevelt, publicly, expressed, optimism, about, the, taft, administration, after, meeting, with, the, president, in, june, 1910, roosevelt, gave, speeches, in, the, west, in, the, late, summer, and, early, fall, of, 1910, in, which, he, severely, criticized, the, nation, s, judiciary, roosevelt, not, only, attacked, the, supreme, court, s, 1905, decision, in, lochner, v, new, york, he, accused, federal, courts, of, undermining, democracy, branding, the, suspect, jurists, fossilized, judges, and, compared, their, tendency, to, strike, down, progressive, reform, legislation, to, justice, roger, b, taney, s, ruling, in, dred, scott, v, sandford, 1857, to, ensure, the, constitution, served, the, public, interests, roosevelt, joined, other, progressives, in, calling, for, the, judicial, recall, which, would, enable, popular, majorities, to, remove, judges, from, office, and, reverse, unpopular, judicial, decisions, this, attack, horrified, taft, who, though, he, privately, agreed, that, lochner, and, other, decisions, had, been, poorly, decided, was, an, adamant, believer, in, judicial, authority, preserving, constitutional, government, his, horror, was, shared, with, other, prominent, members, of, the, elite, legal, community, and, solidified, in, taft, s, mind, that, roosevelt, must, not, be, permitted, to, regain, the, presidency, in, august, 1910, roosevelt, escalated, the, rivalry, with, a, speech, at, osawatomie, kansas, which, was, the, most, radical, of, his, career, it, marked, his, public, break, with, taft, and, conservative, republicans, advocating, a, program, he, called, the, new, nationalism, roosevelt, emphasized, the, priority, of, labor, over, capital, interests, and, the, need, to, control, corporate, creation, and, combination, he, called, for, a, ban, on, corporate, political, contributions, returning, to, new, york, roosevelt, began, a, battle, to, take, control, of, the, state, republican, party, from, william, barnes, jr, taft, had, pledged, his, support, to, roosevelt, in, this, endeavor, and, roosevelt, was, outraged, when, taft, s, support, failed, to, materialize, at, the, 1910, state, convention, roosevelt, campaigned, for, the, republicans, in, the, 1910, elections, in, which, the, democrats, gained, control, of, the, house, for, the, first, time, since, 1892, among, the, newly, elected, democrats, was, senator, franklin, d, roosevelt, who, argued, he, represented, his, distant, cousin, s, policies, better, than, his, republican, opponent, the, republican, progressives, interpreted, the, defeats, as, a, compelling, argument, for, reorganization, of, the, party, in, 1911, senator, robert, m, la, follette, joined, with, pinchot, william, white, and, california, governor, hiram, johnson, to, create, the, national, progressive, republican, league, their, objectives, were, to, defeat, the, power, of, political, bossism, at, the, state, level, and, replace, taft, at, the, national, level, despite, his, skepticism, of, the, league, roosevelt, expressed, general, support, for, progressive, principles, between, january, and, april, 1911, roosevelt, wrote, articles, for, the, outlook, defending, what, he, called, the, great, movement, of, our, day, the, progressive, nationalist, movement, against, special, privilege, and, in, favor, of, an, honest, and, efficient, political, and, industrial, democracy, with, roosevelt, apparently, uninterested, in, running, in, 1912, la, follette, declared, his, own, candidacy, in, june, 1911, roosevelt, continually, criticized, taft, after, the, 1910, elections, and, the, break, between, them, became, final, after, the, justice, department, filed, an, antitrust, lawsuit, against, us, steel, in, september, 1911, roosevelt, was, humiliated, because, he, had, personally, approved, an, acquisition, the, justice, department, was, now, challenging, however, roosevelt, was, still, unwilling, to, run, against, taft, in, 1912, he, hoped, to, run, in, 1916, against, whichever, democrat, beat, taft, in, 1912, taft, was, world, leader, for, arbitration, as, a, guarantee, of, world, peace, in, 1911, he, and, secretary, of, state, philander, c, knox, negotiated, treaties, with, britain, and, france, providing, that, differences, be, arbitrated, disputes, had, to, be, submitted, to, the, hague, court, or, another, tribunal, these, were, signed, in, august, 1911, but, had, to, be, ratified, by, a, two, thirds, vote, of, the, senate, neither, taft, nor, knox, consulted, with, senate, leaders, during, negotiations, by, then, many, republicans, were, opposed, to, taft, and, the, president, felt, lobbying, too, hard, for, the, treaties, might, cause, their, defeat, he, made, speeches, supporting, the, treaties, in, october, but, the, senate, added, amendments, taft, could, not, accept, killing, them, arbitration, revealed, a, dispute, among, american, progressives, one, faction, led, by, taft, looked, to, it, as, the, best, alternative, to, warfare, taft, was, a, constitutional, lawyer, understanding, the, legal, issues, taft, s, base, was, the, conservative, business, community, that, supported, peace, movements, before, 1914, however, he, failed, to, mobilize, them, the, businessmen, believed, economic, rivalries, were, the, cause, of, war, and, that, trade, led, to, an, interdependent, world, that, would, make, war, expensive, and, useless, however, an, opposing, faction, led, by, roosevelt, ridiculed, arbitration, as, foolhardy, idealism, and, insisted, on, the, realism, of, war, as, the, only, solution, to, serious, international, disputes, roosevelt, worked, with, close, friend, senator, henry, cabot, lodge, to, impose, those, amendments, that, ruined, the, treaties, roosevelt, was, acting, to, sabotage, taft, s, campaign, promises, at, a, deeper, level, roosevelt, truly, believed, arbitration, was, a, na, ve, solution, and, great, issues, had, to, be, decided, by, war, the, rooseveltian, approach, incorporated, a, near, mystical, faith, of, the, ennobling, nature, of, war, it, endorsed, jingoistic, nationalism, as, opposed, to, the, businessmen, s, calculation, of, profit, and, national, interest, in, november, 1911, a, group, of, ohio, republicans, endorsed, roosevelt, for, the, party, s, nomination, for, president, roosevelt, conspicuously, declined, to, refuse, a, nomination, soon, thereafter, roosevelt, said, i, am, really, sorry, for, taft, i, am, sure, he, means, well, but, he, means, well, feebly, and, he, does, not, know, how, he, is, utterly, unfit, for, leadership, and, this, is, a, time, when, we, need, leadership, in, january, 1912, roosevelt, declared, if, the, people, make, a, draft, on, me, i, shall, not, decline, to, serve, roosevelt, spoke, before, the, constitutional, convention, in, ohio, identifying, as, a, progressive, and, endorsing, progressive, reforms, even, endorsing, popular, review, of, state, judicial, decisions, in, reaction, to, roosevelt, s, proposals, taft, said, such, extremists, are, not, progressives, they, are, political, emotionalists, or, neurotics, roosevelt, began, to, envision, himself, as, the, savior, of, the, party, from, defeat, in, the, upcoming, election, in, february, 1912, in, boston, roosevelt, said, i, will, accept, the, nomination, for, president, if, it, is, tendered, to, me, elihu, root, and, henry, cabot, lodge, thought, division, would, lead, to, defeat, in, the, election, while, taft, believed, he, would, be, defeated, either, in, the, primary, or, general, election, the, 1912, primaries, represented, the, first, extensive, use, of, the, presidential, primary, a, reform, achievement, of, the, progressive, movement, the, republican, primaries, in, the, south, where, party, regulars, dominated, went, for, taft, as, did, new, york, indiana, michigan, kentucky, and, massachusetts, meanwhile, roosevelt, won, in, illinois, minnesota, nebraska, south, dakota, california, maryland, ohio, and, pennsylvania, at, the, 1912, republican, national, convention, in, chicago, taft, won, the, nomination, on, the, first, ballot, according, to, lewis, l, gould, in, 1912, roosevelt, saw, taft, as, the, agent, of, the, forces, of, reaction, and, of, political, crookedness, roosevelt, had, become, the, most, dangerous, man, in, american, history, said, taft, because, of, his, hold, upon, the, less, intelligent, voters, and, the, discontented, the, republican, national, committee, dominated, by, the, taft, forces, awarded, 235, delegates, to, the, president, and, 19, to, roosevelt, roosevelt, believed, himself, entitled, to, 72, delegates, from, arizona, california, texas, and, washington, that, had, been, given, to, taft, firm, in, his, conviction, that, the, nomination, was, being, stolen, from, him, roosevelt, told, cheering, supporters, that, there, was, a, great, moral, issue, at, stake, and, he, should, have, sixty, to, eighty, lawfully, elected, delegates, added, to, his, total, roosevelt, ended, his, speech,

the, general, interest, this, assertion, is, explicit, mr, wilson, must, know, that, every, monopoly, in, the, united, states, opposes, the, progressive, party, i, challenge, him, to, name, the, monopoly, that, did, support, the, progressive, party, whether, the, sugar, trust, the, us, steel, trust, the, harvester, trust, the, standard, oil, trust, the, tobacco, trust, or, any, other, ours, was, the, only, program, to, which, they, objected, and, they, supported, either, mr, wilson, or, mr, taft, though, many, progressive, party, activists, in, the, north, opposed, the, steady, loss, of, civil, rights, for, blacks, roosevelt, ran, a, lily, white, campaign, in, the, south, rival, all, white, and, all, black, delegations, from, southern, states, arrived, at, the, progressive, national, convention, and, roosevelt, decided, to, seat, the, all, white, delegations, nevertheless, he, won, few, votes, outside, traditional, republican, strongholds, out, of, 1, 100, counties, in, the, south, roosevelt, won, two, counties, in, alabama, one, in, arkansas, seven, in, north, carolina, three, in, georgia, 17, in, tennessee, two, in, texas, one, in, virginia, and, none, in, florida, louisiana, mississippi, or, south, carolina, on, october, 14, 1912, while, arriving, at, a, campaign, event, in, milwaukee, roosevelt, was, shot, by, delusional, saloonkeeper, john, schrank, who, believed, the, ghost, of, assassinated, president, william, mckinley, had, directed, him, to, kill, roosevelt, the, bullet, lodged, in, roosevelt, s, chest, after, penetrating, his, eyeglass, case, and, passing, through, a, 50, page, folded, copy, of, the, speech, titled, progressive, cause, greater, than, any, individual, schrank, was, disarmed, and, captured, by, roosevelt, s, stenographer, elbert, e, martin, as, he, attempted, to, fire, a, second, time, and, might, have, been, lynched, had, roosevelt, not, shouted, for, schrank, to, remain, unharmed, roosevelt, assured, the, crowd, he, was, all, right, then, ordered, police, to, take, schrank, and, make, sure, no, violence, was, done, to, him, as, an, experienced, hunter, and, anatomist, roosevelt, correctly, concluded, that, since, he, was, not, coughing, blood, the, bullet, had, not, reached, his, lung, he, declined, to, go, to, hospital, immediately, and, instead, delivered, a, 90, minute, speech, with, blood, seeping, into, his, shirt, only, afterwards, did, he, accept, medical, attention, probes, and, an, x, ray, showed, the, bullet, had, lodged, in, roosevelt, s, chest, muscle, but, did, not, penetrate, the, pleura, doctors, concluded, it, would, be, less, dangerous, to, leave, it, than, attempt, to, remove, it, and, roosevelt, carried, the, bullet, in, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, taft, and, democratic, nominee, woodrow, wilson, suspended, their, campaigning, until, roosevelt, resumed, his, when, asked, if, the, shooting, would, affect, his, election, campaign, he, said, to, the, reporter, i, m, fit, as, a, bull, moose, the, bull, moose, became, a, symbol, of, roosevelt, and, the, progressive, party, and, it, often, was, referred, to, as, the, bull, moose, party, he, spent, two, weeks, recuperating, before, returning, to, campaign, he, wrote, a, friend, about, the, bullet, i, do, not, mind, it, any, more, than, if, it, were, in, my, waistcoat, pocket, after, the, democrats, nominated, governor, woodrow, wilson, roosevelt, did, not, expect, to, win, the, election, as, wilson, had, compiled, a, record, attractive, to, progressive, democrats, who, might, have, considered, voting, for, roosevelt, roosevelt, still, campaigned, vigorously, and, the, election, developed, into, a, two, person, contest, despite, taft, s, quiet, presence, roosevelt, respected, wilson, but, they, differed, on, various, issues, wilson, opposed, federal, intervention, regarding, women, s, suffrage, or, child, labor, and, attacked, roosevelt, s, tolerance, of, large, businesses, roosevelt, won, 4, 1, million, votes, 27, compared, to, taft, s, 3, 5, million, 23, and, wilson, s, gained, 6, 3, million, 42, wilson, scored, a, massive, landslide, in, the, electoral, college, with, 435, electoral, votes, roosevelt, won, 88, while, taft, won, 8, pennsylvania, was, the, only, eastern, state, won, by, roosevelt, in, the, midwest, he, carried, michigan, minnesota, and, south, dakota, in, the, west, california, and, washington, roosevelt, garnered, a, higher, share, of, the, popular, vote, than, any, other, third, party, presidential, candidate, in, history, and, won, the, most, states, of, any, third, party, candidate, after, the, civil, war, in, 1907, a, friend, of, roosevelt, s, john, augustine, zahm, invited, roosevelt, to, help, plan, a, research, expedition, to, south, america, to, finance, it, roosevelt, obtained, support, from, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, return, for, promising, to, bring, back, new, animal, specimens, roosevelt, s, popular, book, through, the, brazilian, wilderness, describes, his, expedition, into, the, brazilian, jungle, in, 1913, as, a, member, of, the, roosevelt, rondon, scientific, expedition, co, named, after, its, leader, brazilian, c, ndido, rondon, once, in, south, america, a, more, ambitious, goal, was, added, to, find, the, headwaters, of, the, river, duvida, and, trace, it, north, to, the, madeira, and, thence, to, the, amazon, river, duvida, was, later, renamed, roosevelt, river, roosevelt, s, crew, consisted, of, his, son, kermit, colonel, rondon, naturalist, george, kruck, cherrie, brazilian, lieutenant, jo, o, lira, team, physician, jos, antonio, cajazeira, and, 16, skilled, paddlers, and, porters, the, initial, expedition, started, tenuously, on, december, 9, 1913, at, the, height, of, rainy, season, the, trip, down, duvida, started, on, february, 27, 1914, roosevelt, suffered, a, minor, leg, wound, after, he, jumped, in, to, try, to, prevent, canoes, from, smashing, against, the, rocks, the, flesh, wound, he, received, however, soon, gave, him, tropical, fever, that, resembled, the, malaria, he, had, contracted, while, in, cuba, the, infection, weakened, roosevelt, so, greatly, that, six, weeks, in, he, had, to, be, attended, to, constantly, by, the, expedition, s, physician, and, kermit, by, then, he, could, not, walk, because, of, the, infection, and, an, infirmity, in, the, other, leg, due, to, a, traffic, accident, a, decade, earlier, roosevelt, had, chest, pains, and, a, fever, that, soared, to, 103, f, 39, c, and, made, him, delirious, regarding, his, condition, as, a, threat, to, others, survival, roosevelt, insisted, he, be, left, behind, to, allow, the, poorly, provisioned, expedition, to, proceed, preparing, to, commit, suicide, with, morphine, only, an, appeal, by, his, son, persuaded, him, to, continue, despite, roosevelt, s, continued, decline, and, loss, of, 50, pounds, 23, kg, rondon, reduced, the, pace, for, map, making, which, required, regular, stops, to, fix, their, position, by, sun, based, survey, upon, roosevelt, s, return, to, new, york, friends, and, family, were, startled, by, his, physical, appearance, and, fatigue, roosevelt, wrote, perhaps, prophetically, to, a, friend, that, it, had, cut, his, life, short, by, ten, years, for, the, rest, of, his, few, remaining, years, he, would, be, plagued, by, flare, ups, of, malaria, and, leg, inflammations, so, severe, as, to, require, surgery, before, roosevelt, had, even, completed, his, sea, voyage, home, critics, raised, doubts, over, his, claims, of, exploring, and, navigating, a, completely, uncharted, river, over, 625, miles, 1, 006, km, long, when, he, had, recovered, sufficiently, he, addressed, a, standing, room, only, convention, organized, in, washington, by, the, national, geographic, society, and, satisfactorily, defended, his, claims, roosevelt, returned, to, the, u, s, in, may, 1914, though, he, was, outraged, by, the, wilson, administration, s, conclusion, of, a, treaty, that, expressed, sincere, regret, for, the, way, in, which, the, us, had, acquired, the, panama, canal, zone, he, was, impressed, by, many, reforms, passed, roosevelt, made, campaign, appearances, for, the, progressives, but, the, 1914, elections, were, a, disaster, for, the, fledgling, third, party, roosevelt, began, to, envision, another, campaign, for, president, this, time, with, himself, at, the, head, of, the, republican, party, but, conservative, party, leaders, remained, opposed, to, roosevelt, in, hopes, of, engineering, a, joint, nomination, the, progressives, scheduled, the, 1916, progressive, national, convention, at, the, same, time, as, the, 1916, republican, national, convention, when, the, republicans, nominated, charles, evans, hughes, roosevelt, declined, the, progressive, nomination, and, urged, his, progressive, followers, to, support, the, republican, candidate, though, roosevelt, had, long, disliked, hughes, he, disliked, wilson, even, more, and, campaigned, energetically, for, the, republican, nominee, however, wilson, won, the, 1916, election, by, a, narrow, margin, the, progressives, disappeared, as, a, party, and, roosevelt, and, many, of, his, followers, re, joined, the, republican, party, when, the, first, world, war, began, in, 1914, roosevelt, strongly, supported, the, allies, and, demanded, a, harsher, policy, against, germany, especially, regarding, submarine, warfare, roosevelt, angrily, denounced, the, foreign, policy, of, wilson, calling, it, a, failure, regarding, the, atrocities, in, belgium, and, the, violations, of, american, rights, in, 1916, while, campaigning, for, hughes, roosevelt, repeatedly, denounced, irish, americans, and, german, americans, whom, he, described, as, unpatriotic, he, insisted, that, one, had, to, be, 100, american, not, a, hyphenated, american, who, juggled, multiple, loyalties, in, march, 1917, congress, gave, roosevelt, the, authority, to, raise, a, maximum, of, four, divisions, similar, to, the, rough, riders, however, president, wilson, announced, to, the, press, that, he, would, not, send, roosevelt, and, his, volunteers, to, france, but, instead, an, american, expeditionary, force, under, the, command, of, general, john, j, pershing, roosevelt, never, forgave, wilson, and, published, the, foes, of, our, own, household, an, indictment, of, the, sitting, president, roosevelt, s, youngest, son, quentin, a, pilot, with, the, american, forces, in, france, was, killed, when, shot, down, behind, german, lines, on, july, 14, 1918, aged, 20, roosevelt, never, recovered, from, his, loss, roosevelt, was, an, early, supporter, of, the, modern, view, that, there, needs, to, be, a, global, order, in, his, nobel, prize, address, of, 1910, he, said, it, would, be, a, master, stroke, if, those, great, powers, honestly, bent, on, peace, would, form, a, league, of, peace, not, only, to, keep, the, peace, among, themselves, but, to, prevent, by, force, if, necessary, its, being, broken, by, others, it, would, have, executive, power, such, as, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, lacked, he, called, for, american, participation, when, world, war, i, broke, out, roosevelt, proposed, a, world, league, for, the, peace, of, righteousness, in, september, 1914, which, would, preserve, sovereignty, but, limit, armaments, and, require, arbitration, he, added, it, should, be, solemnly, covenanted, that, if, any, nations, refused, to, abide, by, the, decisions, of, such, a, court, then, others, draw, the, sword, in, behalf, of, peace, and, justice, in, 1915, he, outlined, this, plan, more, specifically, urging, nations, guarantee, their, entire, military, force, if, necessary, against, any, nation, that, refused, to, carry, out, arbitration, decrees, or, violated, rights, of, other, nations, though, roosevelt, had, some, concerns, about, the, impact, on, united, states, sovereignty, he, insisted, that, such, a, league, would, only, work, if, the, united, states, participated, as, one, of, the, joint, guarantors, roosevelt, referred, to, this, plan, in, a, 1918, speech, as, the, most, feasible, for, a, league, of, nations, by, this, time, wilson, was, strongly, hostile, to, roosevelt, and, lodge, and, developed, his, own, plans, for, a, different, league, of, nations, it, became, reality, along, wilson, s, lines, at, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, roosevelt, denounced, wilson, s, approach, but, died, before, it, was, adopted, at, paris, however, lodge, was, willing, to, accept, it, with, serious, reservations, in, the, end, on, march, 19, 1920, wilson, had, democratic, senators, vote, against, the, league, with, the, lodge, reservations, and, the, united, states, never, joined, the, league, of, nations, roosevelt, s, attacks, on, wilson, helped, the, republicans, win, control, of, congress, in, the, midterm, elections, of, 1918, he, declined, a, request, from, new, york, republicans, to, run, for, another, gubernatorial, term, but, attacked, wilson, s, fourteen, points, calling, instead, for, the, unconditional, surrender, of, germany, though, his, health, was, uncertain, he, was, seen, as, a, leading, contender, for, the, 1920, republican, nomination, but, insisted, that, if, they, take, me, they, ll, have, to, take, me, without, a, single, modification, of, the, things, that, i, have, always, stood, for, he, wrote, william, allen, white, i, wish, to, do, everything, in, my, power, to, make, the, republican, party, the, party, of, sane, constructive, radicalism, just, as, it, was, under, lincoln, accordingly, he, told, the, 1918, state, convention, of, the, maine, republican, party, that, he, stood, for, old, age, pensions, insurance, for, sickness, and, unemployment, construction, of, public, housing, for, low, income, families, the, reduction, of, working, hours, aid, to, farmers, and, more, regulation, of, large, corporations, while, his, political, profile, remained, high, roosevelt, s, physical, condition, deteriorated, throughout, 1918, due, to, the, long, term, effects, of, jungle, diseases, he, was, hospitalized, for, seven, weeks, and, never, fully, recovered, on, the, night, of, january, 5, 1919, roosevelt, suffered, breathing, problems, after, receiving, treatment, from, his, physician, george, w, faller, he, felt, better, and, went, to, bed, roosevelt, s, last, words, were, either, please, put, out, that, light, james, or, james, will, you, please, out, out, the, light, said, to, his, family, servant, james, e, amos, between, 4, 00, and, 4, 15, the, next, morning, roosevelt, died, at, the, age, of, 60, in, his, sleep, at, sagamore, hill, of, a, blood, clot, in, his, lungs, upon, receiving, word, of, his, death, his, son, archibald, telegraphed, his, siblings, the, old, lion, is, dead, woodrow, wilson, s, vice, president, thomas, r, marshall, said, that, death, had, to, take, roosevelt, sleeping, for, if, he, had, been, awake, there, would, have, been, a, fight, following, a, private, farewell, service, in, the, north, room, at, sagamore, hill, a, simple, funeral, was, held, at, christ, episcopal, church, in, oyster, bay, vice, president, thomas, r, marshall, former, new, york, governor, charles, evans, hughes, senators, warren, g, harding, and, henry, cabot, lodge, and, former, president, william, howard, taft, were, among, the, mourners, the, procession, route, to, youngs, memorial, cemetery, was, lined, with, spectators, and, a, squad, of, mounted, policemen, who, had, ridden, from, new, york, city, roosevelt, was, buried, on, a, hillside, overlooking, oyster, bay, roosevelt, was, a, prolific, author, writing, with, passion, on, subjects, ranging, from, foreign, policy, to, the, importance, of, the, national, park, system, roosevelt, was, also, an, avid, reader, of, poetry, poet, robert, frost, said, that, roosevelt, was, our, kind, he, quoted, poetry, to, me, he, knew, poetry, as, an, editor, of, the, outlook, roosevelt, had, weekly, access, to, a, large, educated, national, audience, in, all, roosevelt, wrote, about, 18, books, each, in, several, editions, including, his, autobiography, the, rough, riders, history, of, the, naval, war, of, 1812, and, others, on, subjects, such, as, ranching, explorations, and, wildlife, his, most, ambitious, book, was, the, four, volume, narrative, the, winning, of, the, west, focused, on, the, american, frontier, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, roosevelt, said, that, the, american, character, indeed, a, new, american, race, had, emerged, from, the, heroic, wilderness, hunters, and, indian, fighters, acting, on, the, frontier, with, little, government, help, in, 1905, roosevelt, became, embroiled, in, a, widely, publicized, literary, debate, known, as, the, nature, fakers, controversy, a, few, years, earlier, naturalist, john, burroughs, had, published, an, article, entitled, real, and, sham, natural, history, in, the, atlantic, monthly, attacking, popular, writers, of, the, day, such, as, ernest, thompson, seton, charles, g, d, roberts, and, william, j, long, for, their, fantastical, representations, of, wildlife, roosevelt, agreed, with, burroughs, s, criticisms, and, published, several, essays, denouncing, the, booming, genre, of, naturalistic, animal, stories, as, yellow, journalism, of, the, woods, it, was, the, president, himself, who, popularized, the, negative, term, nature, faker, to, describe, writers, who, depicted, their, animal, characters, with, excessive, anthropomorphism, british, scholar, marcus, cunliffe, evaluates, the, liberal, argument, that, roosevelt, was, an, opportunist, exhibitionist, and, imperialist, cunliffe, praises, roosevelt, s, versatility, his, respect, for, law, and, his, sincerity, he, argues, that, roosevelt, s, foreign, policy, was, better, than, his, detractors, allege, cunliffe, calls, him, a, big, man, in, several, respects, roosevelt, was, an, active, freemason, and, member, of, the, sons, of, the, american, revolution, he, was, also, a, member, of, the, explorers, club, roosevelt, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, pursuing, what, he, called, in, an, 1899, speech, the, strenuous, life, to, this, end, he, exercised, regularly, and, took, up, boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and, horseback, riding, as, governor, of, new, york, he, boxed, with, sparring, partners, several, times, each, week, a, practice, he, regularly, continued, as, president, until, being, hit, so, hard, in, the, face, he, became, blind, in, his, left, eye, a, fact, not, made, public, until, many, years, later, roosevelt, began, to, believe, in, the, utility, of, jiu, jitsu, training, after, training, with, yoshitsugu, yamashita, concerned, that, the, u, s, would, lose, its, military, supremacy, to, rising, powers, like, japan, roosevelt, began, to, advocate, for, jiu, jitsu, training, for, american, soldiers, roosevelt, was, an, enthusiastic, singlestick, player, and, according, to, harper, s, weekly, showed, up, at, a, white, house, reception, with, his, arm, bandaged, after, a, bout, with, general, leonard, wood, in, 1905, historians, have, often, emphasized, roosevelt, s, warrior, persona, richard, d, white, jr, states, roosevelt, s, warrior, spirit, framed, his, views, of, national, politics, international, relations, he, took, aggressive, positions, regarding, war, with, spain, in, 1898, colombia, in, 1903, and, especially, with, germany, from, 1915, to, 1917, as, a, demonstration, of, american, naval, might, he, sent, the, great, white, fleet, around, the, world, in, 1907, 1909, he, boasted, in, his, autobiography, when, i, left, the, presidency, i, finished, seven, and, a, half, years, of, administration, during, which, not, one, shot, had, been, fired, against, a, foreign, foe, we, were, at, absolute, peace, and, there, was, no, nation, in, the, world, with, whom, a, war, cloud, threatened, no, nation, in, the, world, whom, we, had, wronged, or, from, whom, we, had, anything, to, fear, the, cruise, of, the, battle, fleet, was, not, the, least, of, the, causes, which, ensured, so, peaceful, an, outlook, historian, howard, k, beale, has, argued, he, and, his, associates, came, close, to, seeking, war, for, its, own, sake, ignorant, of, modern, war, roosevelt, romanticized, war, like, many, young, men, tamed, by, civilization, into, law, abiding, but, adventurous, living, he, needed, an, outlet, for, the, pent, up, primordial, man, in, him, and, found, it, in, fighting, and, killing, vicariously, or, directly, in, hunting, or, in, war, indeed, he, had, a, fairly, good, time, in, war, when, war, came, there, was, something, dull, and, effeminate, about, peace, he, gloried, in, war, was, thrilled, by, military, history, and, placed, warlike, qualities, high, in, his, scale, of, values, without, consciously, desiring, it, he, thought, a, little, war, now, and, then, stimulated, admirable, qualities, in, men, certainly, preparedness, for, war, did, roosevelt, often, praised, moral, behavior, but, apparently, never, made, a, spiritual, confession, of, his, own, faith, after, the, 1884, death, of, his, wife, he, almost, never, mentioned, jesus, in, public, or, private, his, rejection, of, dogma, and, spirituality, says, biographer, william, harbaugh, led, to, a, broad, tolerance, roosevelt, publicly, encouraged, church, attendance, and, was, a, conscientious, churchgoer, himself, a, lifelong, adherent, of, the, dutch, reformed, church, when, gas, rationing, was, introduced, during, the, first, world, war, he, walked, the, three, miles, from, his, home, to, the, local, church, and, back, even, after, a, serious, operation, according, to, christian, reisner, religion, was, as, natural, to, mr, roosevelt, as, breathing, and, when, the, travel, library, for, roosevelt, s, famous, smithsonian, sponsored, african, expedition, was, being, assembled, the, bible, was, according, to, his, sister, the, first, book, selected, in, an, address, delivered, to, the, long, island, bible, society, in, 1901, roosevelt, declared, that, every, thinking, man, when, he, thinks, realizes, what, a, very, large, number, of, people, tend, to, forget, that, the, teachings, of, the, bible, are, so, interwoven, and, entwined, with, our, whole, civic, and, social, life, that, it, would, be, literally, i, do, not, mean, figuratively, i, mean, literally, impossible, for, us, to, figure, to, ourselves, what, that, life, would, be, if, these, teachings, were, removed, we, would, lose, almost, all, the, standards, by, which, we, now, judge, both, public, and, private, morals, all, the, standards, toward, which, we, with, more, or, less, of, resolution, strive, to, raise, ourselves, almost, every, man, who, has, by, his, lifework, added, to, the, sum, of, human, achievement, of, which, the, race, is, proud, has, based, his, lifework, largely, upon, the, teachings, of, the, bible, among, the, greatest, men, a, disproportionately, large, number, have, been, diligent, and, close, students, of, the, bible, at, first, hand, when, he, assumed, the, presidency, roosevelt, reassured, many, conservatives, stating, that, the, mechanism, of, modern, business, is, so, delicate, that, extreme, care, must, be, taken, not, to, interfere, with, it, in, a, spirit, of, rashness, or, ignorance, the, following, year, roosevelt, asserted, the, president, s, independence, from, business, interests, by, opposing, the, merger, which, created, the, northern, securities, company, and, many, were, surprised, that, any, president, much, less, an, unelected, one, would, challenge, powerful, banker, j, p, morgan, in, his, last, two, years, as, president, roosevelt, became, increasingly, distrustful, of, big, business, despite, its, close, ties, to, the, republican, party, roosevelt, sought, to, replace, the, 19th, century, laissez, faire, economic, environment, with, a, new, economic, model, which, included, a, larger, regulatory, role, for, the, federal, government, he, believed, that, 19th, century, entrepreneurs, had, risked, their, fortunes, on, innovations, and, new, businesses, and, that, these, capitalists, had, been, rightly, rewarded, by, contrast, he, believed, that, 20th, century, capitalists, risked, little, but, nonetheless, reaped, huge, and, given, the, lack, of, risk, unjust, economic, rewards, without, a, redistribution, of, wealth, away, from, the, upper, class, roosevelt, feared, that, the, country, would, turn, to, radicals, or, fall, to, revolution, his, square, deal, domestic, program, had, three, main, goals, conservation, of, natural, resources, control, of, corporations, and, consumer, protection, the, square, deal, evolved, into, his, program, of, new, nationalism, which, emphasized, the, priority, of, labor, over, capital, interests, and, a, need, to, more, effectively, control, corporate, creation, and, combination, and, proposed, a, ban, on, corporate, political, contributions, in, the, analysis, by, henry, kissinger, roosevelt, was, the, first, president, to, develop, the, guideline, that, it, was, the, duty, of, the, united, states, to, make, its, enormous, power, and, potential, influence, felt, globally, the, idea, of, being, a, passive, city, on, the, hill, model, that, others, could, look, up, to, he, rejected, roosevelt, trained, in, biology, was, a, social, darwinist, who, believed, in, survival, of, the, fittest, the, international, world, in, his, view, was, a, realm, of, violence, and, conflict, the, united, states, had, all, the, economic, and, geographical, potential, to, be, the, fittest, nation, on, the, globe, the, united, states, had, a, duty, to, act, decisively, for, example, in, terms, of, the, monroe, doctrine, america, had, to, prevent, european, incursions, in, the, western, hemisphere, but, there, was, more, as, he, expressed, in, his, roosevelt, corollary, to, the, monroe, doctrine, the, u, s, had, to, be, the, policeman, of, the, region, because, unruly, corrupt, smaller, nations, had, to, be, controlled, and, if, united, states, did, not, do, it, european, powers, would, in, fact, intervene, and, develop, their, own, base, of, power, in, the, hemisphere, in, contravention, to, the, monroe, doctrine, roosevelt, was, a, realist, and, a, conservative, he, deplored, many, of, the, increasingly, popular, idealistic, liberal, themes, such, as, were, promoted, by, william, jennings, bryan, the, anti, imperialists, and, woodrow, wilson, kissinger, says, he, rejected, the, efficacy, of, international, law, roosevelt, argued, that, if, a, country, could, not, protect, its, own, interests, the, international, community, could, not, help, very, much, he, ridiculed, disarmament, proposals, that, were, increasingly, common, he, saw, no, likelihood, of, an, international, power, capable, of, checking, wrongdoing, on, a, major, scale, as, for, world, government, i, regard, the, wilson, bryan, attitude, of, trusting, to, fantastic, peace, treaties, too, impossible, promises, to, all, kinds, of, scraps, of, paper, without, any, backing, in, efficient, force, as, abhorrent, it, is, infinitely, better, for, a, nation, and, for, the, world, to, have, the, frederick, the, great, and, bismarck, tradition, as, regards, foreign, policy, than, to, have, the, bryan, or, bryan, wilson, attitude, as, a, permanent, national, attitude, a, milk, and, water, righteousness, unbacked, by, force, is, as, wicked, as, and, even, more, mischievous, than, force, divorced, from, righteousness, on, his, international, outlook, roosevelt, favored, spheres, of, influence, whereby, one, great, power, would, generally, prevail, such, as, the, united, states, in, the, western, hemisphere, or, great, britain, in, the, indian, subcontinent, japan, fit, that, role, and, he, approved, however, he, had, deep, distrust, of, both, germany, and, russia, historians, credit, roosevelt, for, changing, the, nation, s, political, system, by, placing, the, bully, pulpit, of, the, presidency, at, center, stage, and, emphasizing, character, as, much, as, issues, his, accomplishments, include, trust, busting, and, conservationism, he, is, a, hero, to, liberals, and, progressives, for, his, early, proposals, that, foreshadowed, the, modern, welfare, state, including, federal, taxation, labor, reforms, and, more, direct, democracy, conservationists, admire, roosevelt, for, prioritizing, the, environment, and, selflessness, towards, future, generations, conservatives, and, nationalists, respect, his, commitment, to, law, and, order, civic, duty, and, military, values, dalton, states, today, he, is, heralded, as, the, architect, of, the, modern, presidency, as, a, world, leader, who, boldly, reshaped, the, office, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, new, century, liberals, and, socialists, criticize, his, interventionist, and, imperialist, approach, while, libertarians, reject, his, vision, of, the, welfare, state, historians, typically, rank, roosevelt, among, the, top, five, presidents, dalton, says, roosevelt, is, remembered, as, one, of, the, most, picturesque, personalities, who, has, ever, enlivened, the, landscape, his, friend, historian, henry, adams, proclaimed, roosevelt, more, than, any, other, man, showed, the, singular, primitive, quality, that, belongs, to, ultimate, matter, the, quality, that, medieval, theology, assigned, to, god, he, was, pure, act, cooper, compared, him, with, woodrow, wilson, highlighting, their, roles, as, warrior, and, priest, dalton, stressed, roosevelt, s, strenuous, life, brands, calls, roosevelt, the, last, romantic, viewing, his, romantic, notion, of, life, as, emerging, from, his, belief, in, physical, bravery, as, the, highest, virtue, henry, f, pringle, who, won, the, pulitzer, prize, for, theodore, roosevelt, 1931, stated, the, roosevelt, of, later, years, was, the, most, adolescent, of, men, roosevelt, as, the, exemplar, of, american, masculinity, has, become, a, major, theme, he, often, warned, that, men, were, becoming, too, complacent, failing, in, their, duties, to, propagate, the, race, and, exhibit, masculine, vigor, historian, serge, ricard, noted, that, roosevelt, s, advocacy, of, the, strenuous, life, made, him, an, ideal, subject, for, psycho, historical, analysis, of, aggressive, manhood, in, his, era, he, promoted, competitive, sports, for, physically, strengthening, american, men, and, supported, organizations, like, the, boy, scouts, to, mold, and, strengthen, the, character, of, american, boys, brands, shows, that, heroic, displays, of, bravery, were, central, to, roosevelt, s, image, what, makes, the, hero, a, hero, is, the, romantic, notion, that, he, stands, above, the, tawdry, give, and, take, of, everyday, politics, occupying, an, ethereal, realm, where, partisanship, gives, way, to, patriotism, and, division, to, unity, and, where, the, nation, regains, its, lost, innocence, in, 1902, th, obald, chartran, was, commissioned, to, paint, roosevelt, s, presidential, portrait, roosevelt, hid, it, in, a, closet, before, having, it, destroyed, because, it, made, him, look, like, a, meek, kitten, roosevelt, instead, chose, john, singer,

for, the, medal, of, honor, however, the, recommendation, lacked, any, eyewitnesses, and, the, effort, was, tainted, by, roosevelt, s, lobbying, of, the, war, department, in, the, 1990s, roosevelt, s, supporters, again, recommended, the, award, which, was, denied, by, the, secretary, of, the, army, on, the, basis, the, decorations, board, determined, roosevelt, s, bravery, in, battle, did, not, rise, to, the, level, that, would, justify, the, medal, of, honor, and, indeed, it, did, not, rise, to, the, level, of, men, who, fought, in, that, engagement, nevertheless, politicians, apparently, convinced, the, secretary, to, reconsider, and, reverse, himself, leading, to, the, charge, it, was, a, politically, motivated, award, in, 2001, president, bill, clinton, awarded, theodore, roosevelt,
