tell, hitler, but, also, saw, this, event, as, an, opportunity, to, dispose, of, blomberg, blomberg, was, forced, to, resign, g, ring, did, not, want, fritsch, to, be, appointed, to, that, position, and, thus, be, his, superior, several, days, later, heydrich, revealed, a, file, on, fritsch, that, contained, allegations, of, homosexual, activity, and, blackmail, the, charges, were, later, proven, to, be, false, but, fritsch, had, lost, hitler, s, trust, and, was, forced, to, resign, hitler, used, the, dismissals, as, an, opportunity, to, reshuffle, the, leadership, of, the, military, g, ring,

ribbentrop, had, been, named, foreign, minister, in, february, 1938, g, ring, continued, to, involve, himself, in, foreign, affairs, that, july, he, contacted, the, british, government, with, the, idea, that, he, should, make, an, official, visit, to, discuss, germany, s, intentions, for, czechoslovakia, neville, chamberlain, was, in, favour, of, a, meeting, and, there, was, talk, of, a, pact,

hungarian, government, that, summer, as, well, discussing, their, potential, role, in, an, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, at, the, nuremberg, rally, that, september, g, ring, and, other, speakers, denounced, the, czechs, as, an, inferior, race, that, must, be, conquered, chamberlain, and, hitler, had, a, series, of, meetings, that, led, to, the, signing, of, the, munich, agreement, 29, september, 1938, which, turned, over, control, of, the, sudetenland, to, germany, in, march, 1939, g, ring, threatened, czechoslovak, president, emil, h, cha, with, the, bombing, of, prague, h, cha, then, agreed, to, sign, a, communique, accepting, the, german, occupation, of, the, remainder, of, bohemia, and, moravia, although, many, in, the, party, disliked, him, before, the, war, g, ring, enjoyed, widespread, personal, popularity, among, the, german, public, because, of, his, perceived, sociability, colour, and, humour, as, the, nazi, leader, most, responsible, for, economic, matters, he, presented, himself, as, a, champion, of, national, interests, over, allegedly, corrupt, big, business, and, the, old, german, elite, the, nazi, press, was, on, g, ring, s, side, other, leaders, such, as, hess, and, ribbentrop, were, envious, of, his, popularity, in, britain, and, the, united, states, some, viewed, g, ring, as, more, acceptable, than, the, other, nazis, and, as, a, possible, mediator, between, the, western, democracies, and, hitler, g, ring, and, other, senior, officers, were, concerned, that, germany, was, not, yet, ready, for, war, but, hitler, insisted, on, pushing, ahead, as, soon, as, possible, on, 30, august, 1939, immediately, prior, to, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, hitler, appointed, g, ring, as, the, chairman, of, a, new, six, person, council, of, ministers, for, the, defense, of, the, reich, which, was, set, up, to, operate, as, a, war, cabinet, the, invasion, of, poland, the, opening, action, of, world, war, ii, began, at, dawn, on, 1, september, 1939, later, in, the, day, speaking, to, the, reichstag, hitler, designated, g, ring, as, his, successor, as, f, hrer, of, all, germany, if, anything, should, befall, me, with, hess, as, the, second, alternate, big, german, victories, followed, one, after, the, other, in, quick, succession, with, the, help, of, the, luftwaffe, the, polish, air, force, was, defeated, within, a, week, the, fallschirmj, ger, seized, vital, airfields, in, norway, operation, weser, bung, and, captured, fort, eben, emael, in, belgium, on, 10, may, 1940, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, france, g, ring, s, luftwaffe, played, critical, roles, in, the, battles, of, the, netherlands, of, belgium, and, of, france, in, may, 1940, after, the, fall, of, france, hitler, awarded, g, ring, the, grand, cross, of, the, iron, cross, for, his, successful, leadership, during, the, 1940, field, marshal, ceremony, hitler, promoted, g, ring, to, the, rank, of, reichsmarschall, des, grossdeutschen, reiches, transl, reich, marshal, of, the, greater, german, reich, a, specially, created, rank, which, made, him, senior, to, all, field, marshals, in, the, military, as, a, result, of, this, promotion, he, was, the, highest, ranking, soldier, in, germany, until, the, end, of, the, war, g, ring, had, already, received, the, knight, s, cross, of, the, iron, cross, on, 30, september, 1939, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, luftwaffe, the, uk, had, declared, war, on, germany, on, 3, september, 1939, the, third, day, of, the, invasion, of, poland, in, july, 1940, hitler, began, preparations, for, an, invasion, of, britain, as, part, of, the, plan, the, royal, air, force, raf, had, to, be, neutralized, bombing, raids, commenced, on, british, air, installations, and, on, cities, and, centres, of, industry, g, ring, had, by, then, already, announced, in, a, radio, speech, if, as, much, as, a, single, enemy, aircraft, flies, over, german, soil, my, name, is, meier, something, that, would, return, to, haunt, him, when, the, raf, began, bombing, german, cities, on, 11, may, 1940, though, he, was, confident, the, luftwaffe, could, defeat, the, raf, within, days, g, ring, like, admiral, erich, raeder, commander, in, chief, of, the, kriegsmarine, navy, was, pessimistic, about, the, chance, of, success, of, the, planned, invasion, codenamed, operation, sea, lion, g, ring, hoped, that, a, victory, in, the, air, would, be, enough, to, force, peace, without, an, invasion, the, campaign, failed, and, sea, lion, was, postponed, indefinitely, on, 17, september, 1940, after, their, defeat, in, the, battle, of, britain, the, luftwaffe, attempted, to, defeat, britain, via, strategic, bombing, on, 12, october, 1940, hitler, cancelled, sea, lion, due, to, the, onset, of, winter, by, the, end, of, the, year, it, was, clear, that, british, morale, was, not, being, shaken, by, the, blitz, though, the, bombings, continued, through, may, 1941, in, spite, of, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, signed, in, 1939, nazi, germany, began, operation, barbarossa, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, on, 22, june, 1941, initially, the, luftwaffe, was, at, an, advantage, destroying, thousands, of, soviet, aircraft, in, the, first, month, of, fighting, hitler, and, his, top, staff, were, sure, that, the, campaign, would, be, over, by, christmas, and, no, provisions, were, made, for, reserves, of, men, or, equipment, but, by, july, the, germans, had, only, 1, 000, planes, remaining, in, operation, and, their, troop, losses, were, over, 213, 000, men, the, choice, was, made, to, concentrate, the, attack, on, only, one, part, of, the, vast, front, efforts, would, be, directed, at, capturing, moscow, after, the, long, but, successful, battle, of, smolensk, hitler, ordered, army, group, centre, to, halt, its, advance, to, moscow, and, temporarily, diverted, its, panzer, groups, north, and, south, to, aid, in, the, encirclement, of, leningrad, and, kiev, the, pause, provided, the, red, army, with, an, opportunity, to, mobilize, fresh, reserves, historian, russel, stolfi, considers, it, to, be, one, of, the, major, factors, that, caused, the, failure, of, the, moscow, offensive, which, was, resumed, in, october, 1941, with, the, battle, of, moscow, poor, weather, conditions, fuel, shortages, a, delay, in, building, aircraft, bases, in, eastern, europe, and, overstretched, supply, lines, were, also, factors, hitler, did, not, give, permission, for, even, a, partial, retreat, until, mid, january, 1942, by, this, time, the, losses, were, comparable, to, those, of, the, french, invasion, of, russia, in, 1812, in, late, october, or, early, november, 1941, hitler, and, g, ring, decided, on, the, mass, deportation, of, soviet, prisoners, of, war, and, a, larger, number, of, soviet, civilians, to, germany, for, forced, labor, but, epidemics, soon, caused, the, halting, of, prisoner, of, war, transports, those, who, were, deported, to, germany, faced, conditions, not, necessarily, any, better, than, existed, in, the, occupied, soviet, union, by, the, end, of, the, war, at, least, 1, 3, million, soviet, prisoners, of, war, had, been, deported, to, germany, or, its, annexed, territories, of, these, 400, 000, did, not, survive, and, most, of, these, deaths, occurred, in, the, winter, of, 1941, 1942, after, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, g, ring, along, with, field, marshal, wilhelm, keitel, and, admiral, erich, raeder, urged, hitler, to, immediately, declare, war, on, the, united, states, hitler, decided, that, the, summer, 1942, campaign, would, be, concentrated, in, the, south, efforts, would, be, made, to, capture, the, oilfields, in, the, caucasus, the, battle, of, stalingrad, a, major, turning, point, of, the, war, began, on, 23, august, 1942, with, a, bombing, campaign, by, the, luftwaffe, the, german, sixth, army, entered, the, city, but, because, of, its, location, on, the, front, line, it, was, still, possible, for, the, soviets, to, encircle, and, trap, it, there, without, reinforcements, or, supplies, when, the, sixth, army, was, surrounded, by, the, end, of, november, in, operation, uranus, g, ring, promised, that, the, luftwaffe, would, be, able, to, deliver, a, minimum, of, 300, tons, of, supplies, to, the, trapped, men, every, day, on, the, basis, of, these, assurances, hitler, demanded, that, there, be, no, retreat, they, were, to, fight, to, the, last, man, though, some, airlifts, were, able, to, get, through, supplies, delivered, never, exceeded, 120, tons, per, day, the, remnants, of, the, sixth, army, some, 91, 000, men, out, of, an, army, of, 285, 000, surrendered, in, early, february, 1943, only, 5, 000, of, these, captives, survived, the, soviet, prisoner, of, war, camps, to, see, germany, again, meanwhile, the, strength, of, the, us, and, british, bomber, fleets, had, increased, based, in, britain, they, began, operations, against, german, targets, the, first, thousand, bomber, raid, was, staged, on, cologne, on, 30, may, 1942, air, raids, continued, on, targets, farther, from, england, after, auxiliary, fuel, tanks, were, installed, on, us, fighter, aircraft, g, ring, refused, to, believe, reports, that, american, fighters, had, been, shot, down, as, far, east, as, aachen, in, winter, 1942, 1943, his, reputation, began, to, decline, the, american, p, 51, mustang, with, a, combat, radius, of, over, 1, 800, miles, 2, 900, km, when, using, underwing, drop, tanks, began, to, escort, the, bombers, in, large, formations, to, and, from, the, target, area, in, early, 1944, from, that, point, onwards, the, luftwaffe, began, to, suffer, casualties, in, aircrews, it, could, not, sufficiently, replace, by, targeting, oil, refineries, and, rail, communications, allied, bombers, crippled, the, german, war, effort, by, late, 1944, german, civilians, blamed, g, ring, for, his, failure, to, protect, the, homeland, hitler, began, excluding, him, from, conferences, but, retained, him, in, his, positions, at, the, head, of, the, luftwaffe, and, as, plenipotentiary, of, the, four, year, plan, as, he, lost, hitler, s, trust, g, ring, began, to, spend, more, time, at, his, various, residences, on, d, day, 6, june, 1944, the, luftwaffe, only, had, some, 300, fighters, and, a, small, number, of, bombers, in, the, area, of, the, landings, the, allies, had, a, total, strength, of, 11, 000, aircraft, as, the, soviets, approached, berlin, hitler, s, efforts, to, organise, the, defence, of, the, city, became, ever, more, meaningless, and, futile, his, last, birthday, celebrated, at, the, f, hrerbunker, in, berlin, on, 20, april, 1945, was, the, occasion, for, leave, taking, by, many, top, nazis, g, ring, included, by, this, time, g, ring, s, hunting, lodge, carinhall, had, been, evacuated, the, building, destroyed, and, its, art, treasures, moved, to, berchtesgaden, and, elsewhere, g, ring, arrived, at, his, estate, at, obersalzberg, on, 22, april, the, same, day, that, hitler, in, a, lengthy, diatribe, against, his, generals, first, publicly, admitted, that, the, war, was, lost, and, that, he, intended, to, remain, in, berlin, to, the, end, and, then, commit, suicide, he, also, stated, that, g, ring, was, in, a, better, position, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, okw, operations, chief, alfred, jodl, was, present, for, hitler, s, rant, and, notified, g, ring, s, chief, of, staff, karl, koller, at, a, meeting, a, few, hours, later, sensing, its, implications, koller, immediately, flew, to, berchtesgaden, to, notify, g, ring, of, this, development, a, week, after, the, start, of, the, soviet, invasion, hitler, had, issued, a, decree, naming, g, ring, his, successor, in, the, event, of, his, death, thus, codifying, the, declaration, he, had, made, soon, after, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, decree, also, gave, g, ring, full, authority, to, act, as, hitler, s, deputy, if, hitler, ever, lost, his, freedom, of, action, g, ring, feared, being, branded, a, traitor, if, he, tried, to, take, power, but, also, feared, being, accused, of, dereliction, of, duty, if, he, did, nothing, after, some, hesitation, g, ring, reviewed, his, copy, of, the, 1941, decree, naming, him, hitler, s, successor, after, conferring, with, koller, and, hans, lammers, the, state, secretary, of, the, reich, chancellery, g, ring, concluded, that, by, remaining, in, berlin, to, face, certain, death, hitler, had, incapacitated, himself, from, governing, all, agreed, that, under, the, terms, of, the, decree, it, was, incumbent, upon, g, ring, to, take, power, in, hitler, s, stead, he, was, also, motivated, by, fears, that, his, rival, martin, bormann, would, seize, power, upon, hitler, s, death, and, would, have, him, killed, as, a, traitor, with, this, in, mind, g, ring, sent, a, carefully, worded, telegram, asking, hitler, for, permission, to, take, over, as, the, leader, of, germany, stressing, that, he, would, be, acting, as, hitler, s, deputy, he, added, that, if, hitler, did, not, reply, by, 22, 00, that, night, 23, april, he, would, assume, that, hitler, had, indeed, lost, his, freedom, of, action, and, would, assume, leadership, of, the, reich, the, telegram, was, intercepted, by, bormann, who, convinced, hitler, that, g, ring, was, attempting, a, coup, bormann, argued, that, g, ring, s, telegram, was, not, a, request, for, permission, to, act, as, hitler, s, deputy, but, a, demand, to, resign, or, be, overthrown, bormann, also, intercepted, another, telegram, in, which, g, ring, directed, ribbentrop, to, report, to, him, if, there, was, no, further, communication, from, hitler, or, g, ring, before, midnight, hitler, sent, a, reply, to, g, ring, prepared, with, bormann, s, help, rescinding, the, 1941, decree, and, threatening, him, with, execution, for, high, treason, unless, he, immediately, resigned, from, all, of, his, offices, realizing, his, situation, was, untenable, g, ring, duly, resigned, afterwards, hitler, or, bormann, depending, on, the, source, ordered, the, ss, to, place, g, ring, his, staff, and, lammers, under, house, arrest, at, obersalzberg, bormann, made, an, announcement, over, the, radio, that, g, ring, had, resigned, for, health, reasons, by, 26, april, the, complex, at, obersalzberg, was, under, attack, by, the, allies, so, g, ring, was, moved, to, his, castle, at, mauterndorf, in, his, last, will, and, testament, hitler, expelled, g, ring, from, the, party, formally, rescinded, the, decree, making, him, his, successor, and, upbraided, g, ring, for, illegally, attempting, to, seize, control, of, the, state, he, then, appointed, karl, d, nitz, the, navy, s, commander, in, chief, as, president, of, the, reich, and, supreme, commander, of, the, armed, forces, hitler, and, his, wife, eva, braun, committed, suicide, on, 30, april, 1945, a, few, hours, after, a, hastily, arranged, wedding, g, ring, was, freed, on, 5, may, by, a, passing, luftwaffe, unit, and, he, made, his, way, to, the, u, s, lines, in, hopes, of, surrendering, to, them, rather, than, to, the, soviets, he, was, taken, into, custody, near, radstadt, on, 6, may, by, elements, of, the, 36th, infantry, division, of, the, us, army, this, move, likely, saved, g, ring, s, life, bormann, had, ordered, him, executed, if, berlin, had, fallen, on, 10, may, us, air, forces, commander, carl, spaatz, conducted, an, interrogation, of, g, ring, along, with, lieutenant, general, hoyt, vandenberg,
