died, shortly, after, birth, c, 1880, one, of, the, formative, influences, of, adenauer, s, youth, was, the, so, called, kulturkampf, the, struggle, of, the, prussian, state, with, the, catholic, church, an, experience, that, as, related, to, him, by, his, parents, left, him, with, a, lifelong, dislike, for, prussianism, and, led, him, like, many, other, catholic, rhinelanders, of, the, 19th, century, to, deeply, resent, the, rhineland, s, inclusion, in, prussia, having, a, passion, for, inventing, adenauer, started, experimenting, with, plants, in, the, back, garden, as, a, child, which, was, not, welcomed, by, his, father, who, told, him, one, should, not, try, to, meddle, with, the, lord, s, hand, then, in, 1904, he, invented, a, reaction, steam, engine, which, was, supposed, to, filter, out, dust, produced, by, cars, however, as, his, hobby, of, inventing, grew, ever, more, costly, adenauer, s, activities, in, this, area, slowly, diminished, after, final, school, examination, abitur, in, 1894, adenauer, studied, law, and, politics, at, the, universities, of, freiburg, munich, and, bonn, demonstrating, competent, but, not, exceptional, academic, ability, in, 1896, he, was, mustered, for, the, prussian, army, but, did, not, pass, the, physical, exam, due, to, chronic, respiratory, problems, he, had, experienced, since, childhood, he, was, a, member, of, several, roman,

party, german, deutsche, zentrumspartei, or, just, zentrum, in, 1906, and, was, elected, to, cologne, s, city, government, in, the, same, year, in, 1909, he, became, vice, mayor, of, cologne, an, industrial, metropolis, with, a, population, of, 635, 000, in, 1914, avoiding, the, extreme, political, movements, that, attracted, so, many, of, his, generation, adenauer, was, committed, to, bourgeois, decency, diligence, order, christian, morals, and, values, and, was, dedicated, to, rooting, out, disorder, inefficiency, irrationality, and, political, immorality, in, 1917, he, was, unanimously, elected, as, mayor, of, cologne, for, a, 12, year, period, and, re, elected, in, 1929, during, world, war, i, he, worked, closely, with, the, army, to, maximize, the, city, s, role, as, a, rear, base, of, supply, and, transportation, for, the, western, front, he, paid, special, attention, to, the, civilian, food, supply, enabling, the, residents, to, avoid, the, worst, of, the, severe, shortages, that, beset, most, german, cities, during, 1918, 1919, in, 1918, he, invented, a, soy, based, sausage, called, the, cologne, sausage, to, help, feed, the, city, in, the, face, of, the, collapse, of, the, old, regime, and, the, threat, of, revolution, and, widespread, disorder, in, late, 1918, adenauer, maintained, control, in, cologne, using, his, good, working, relationship, with, the, social, democrats, in, a, speech, on, 1, february, 1919, adenauer, called, for, the, dissolution, of, prussia, and, for, the, prussian, rhineland, to, become, a, new, autonomous, land, state, in, the, reich, adenauer, claimed, this, was, the, only, way, to, prevent, france, from, annexing, the, rhineland, both, the, reich, and, prussian, governments, were, completely, against, adenauer, s, plans, for, breaking, up, prussia, when, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, were, presented, to, germany, in, june, 1919, adenauer, again, suggested, to, berlin, his, plan, for, an, autonomous, rhineland, state, and, again, his, plans, were, rejected, by, the, reich, government, he, established, a, good, working, relationship, with, the, postwar, british, military, authorities, using, them, to, neutralize, the, workers, and, soldiers, council, that, had, become, an, alternative, base, of, power, for, the, city, s, left, wing, during, the, weimar, republic, he, was, president, of, the, prussian, state, council, from, 1921, to, 1933, which, was, the, representation, of, the, provinces, of, prussia, in, its, legislature, a, major, debate, had, occurred, within, his, centre, party, since, 1906, regarding, the, question, of, whether, it, should, leave, the, tower, i, e, allow, protestants, to, join, becoming, a, multi, faith, party, or, stay, in, the, tower, i, e, continue, to, be, a, catholic, only, party, adenauer, was, one, of, the, leading, advocates, of, leaving, the, tower, which, led, to, a, dramatic, clash, at, the, 1922, katholikentag, the, annual, meeting, of, german, catholics, under, the, presidency, of, adenauer, cardinal, michael, von, faulhaber, publicly, admonished, adenauer, for, wanting, to, take, the, zentrum, out, of, the, tower, in, mid, october, 1923, the, chancellor, gustav, stresemann, announced, that, berlin, would, cease, all, financial, payments, to, the, rhineland, and, that, the, new, currency, rentenmark, which, had, replaced, the, now, worthless, mark, would, not, circulate, in, the, rhineland, to, save, the, rhineland, economy, adenauer, opened, talks, with, the, french, high, commissioner, paul, tirard, in, late, october, 1923, for, a, rhenish, republic, in, a, sort, of, economic, union, with, france, which, would, achieve, franco, german, reconciliation, which, adenauer, called, a, grand, design, at, the, same, time, adenauer, clung, to, the, hope, that, the, rentenmark, might, still, circulate, in, the, rhineland, adenauer, s, plans, came, to, naught, when, stresemann, who, was, resolutely, opposed, to, adenauer, s, grand, design, which, he, viewed, as, borderline, treason, was, able, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, crisis, on, his, own, in, 1926, the, zentrum, suggested, adenauer, becoming, chancellor, an, offer, that, he, was, interested, in, but, ultimately, rejected, when, the, german, people, s, party, insisted, that, one, of, the, conditions, for, entering, into, a, coalition, under, adenauer, s, leadership, was, that, gustav, stresemann, stay, on, as, foreign, minister, adenauer, who, disliked, stresemann, as, too, prussian, rejected, that, condition, when, the, nazi, party, won, several, municipal, state, and, national, elections, in, between, 1930, and, 1932, adenauer, a, strong, opponent, of, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazis, still, believed, that, improvements, in, the, national, economy, would, make, his, strategy, work, ignore, the, nazis, and, concentrate, on, the, communist, threat, he, thought, that, based, on, election, returns, the, nazis, should, become, part, of, the, prussian, and, reich, governments, even, when, he, was, already, the, target, of, intense, personal, attacks, political, maneuverings, around, the, ageing, president, hindenburg, then, brought, the, nazis, to, power, on, 30, january, 1933, by, early, february, adenauer, finally, realized, the, futility, of, all, discussions, and, any, attempts, at, compromise, with, the, nazis, cologne, s, city, council, and, the, prussian, parliament, had, been, dissolved, on, 4, april, 1933, he, was, officially, dismissed, as, mayor, and, his, bank, accounts, were, frozen, he, had, no, money, no, home, and, no, job, after, arranging, for, the, safety, of, his, family, he, appealed, to, the, abbot, of, the, benedictine, monastery, at, maria, laach, for, a, stay, of, several, months, according, to, albert, speer, in, his, book, spandau, the, secret, diaries, hitler, expressed, admiration, for, adenauer, noting, his, civic, projects, the, building, of, a, road, circling, the, city, as, a, bypass, and, a, green, belt, of, parks, however, both, hitler, and, speer, concluded, that, adenauer, s, political, views, and, principles, made, it, impossible, for, him, to, play, any, role, in, nazi, germany, adenauer, was, imprisoned, for, two, days, after, the, night, of, the, long, knives, on, 30, june, 1934, however, on, 10, august, 1934, maneuvering, for, his, pension, he, wrote, a, ten, page, letter, to, hermann, g, ring, the, prussian, interior, minister, he, stated, that, as, mayor, he, had, violated, prussian, laws, in, order, to, allow, nazi, events, in, public, buildings, and, nazi, flags, to, be, flown, from, city, flagpoles, and, that, in, 1932, he, had, declared, publicly, that, the, nazis, should, join, the, reich, government, in, a, leading, role, at, the, end, of, 1932, adenauer, had, indeed, demanded, a, joint, government, by, his, zentrum, party, and, the, nazis, for, prussia, during, the, next, two, years, adenauer, changed, residences, often, for, fear, of, reprisals, against, him, while, living, on, the, benevolence, of, friends, with, the, help, of, lawyers, in, august, 1937, he, was, successful, in, claiming, a, pension, he, received, a, cash, settlement, for, his, house, which, had, been, taken, over, by, the, city, of, cologne, his, unpaid, mortgage, penalties, and, taxes, were, waived, with, reasonable, financial, security, he, managed, to, live, in, seclusion, for, some, years, after, the, failed, assassination, attempt, on, hitler, of, july, 1944, he, was, imprisoned, for, a, second, time, as, an, opponent, of, the, regime, he, fell, ill, and, credited, eugen, zander, a, former, municipal, worker, in, cologne, and, a, communist, with, saving, his, life, zander, then, a, section, kapo, of, a, labor, camp, near, bonn, discovered, adenauer, s, name, on, a, deportation, list, to, the, east, and, managed, to, get, him, admitted, to, a, hospital, adenauer, was, subsequently, rearrested, as, was, his, wife, but, was, released, from, prison, at, brauweiler, in, november, 1944, shortly, after, the, war, ended, the, american, occupation, forces, once, again, installed, him, as, mayor, of, cologne, which, had, been, heavily, bombed, after, the, city, was, transferred, into, the, british, zone, of, occupation, however, the, director, of, its, military, government, general, gerald, templer, dismissed, adenauer, for, incompetence, in, december, 1945, adenauer, considered, the, germans, the, political, equals, of, the, occupying, allies, a, view, that, angered, templer, adenauer, s, dismissal, by, the, british, contributed, much, to, his, subsequent, political, success, and, allowed, him, to, pursue, a, policy, of, alliance, with, the, occupying, allies, in, the, 1950s, without, facing, charges, of, being, a, sell, out, after, being, dismissed, adenauer, devoted, himself, to, building, a, new, political, party, the, christian, democratic, union, cdu, which, he, hoped, would, embrace, both, protestants, and, catholics, in, a, single, party, according, to, adenauer, a, catholic, only, party, would, lead, to, german, politics, being, dominated, by, anti, democratic, parties, yet, again, in, january, 1946, adenauer, initiated, a, political, meeting, of, the, future, cdu, in, the, british, zone, in, his, role, as, doyen, the, oldest, man, in, attendance, alterspr, sident, and, was, informally, confirmed, as, its, leader, during, the, weimar, republic, adenauer, had, often, been, considered, a, future, chancellor, and, after, 1945, his, claims, for, leadership, were, even, stronger, the, other, surviving, zentrum, leaders, were, considered, unsuitable, for, the, tasks, that, lay, ahead, reflecting, his, background, as, a, catholic, rhinelander, who, had, long, chafed, under, prussian, rule, adenauer, believed, that, prussianism, was, the, root, cause, of, national, socialism, and, that, only, by, driving, out, prussianism, could, germany, become, a, democracy, in, a, december, 1946, letter, adenauer, wrote, that, the, prussian, state, in, the, early, 19th, century, had, become, an, almost, god, like, entity, that, valued, state, power, over, the, rights, of, individuals, adenauer, s, dislike, of, prussia, even, led, him, to, oppose, berlin, as, a, future, capital, adenauer, viewed, the, most, important, battle, in, the, postwar, world, as, between, the, forces, of, christianity, and, marxism, especially, communism, marxism, meant, both, the, communists, and, the, social, democrats, as, the, latter, were, officially, a, marxist, party, until, the, bad, godesberg, conference, of, 1959, the, same, anti, marxist, viewpoints, led, adenauer, to, denounce, the, social, democrats, as, the, heirs, to, prussianism, and, national, socialism, adenauer, s, ideology, was, at, odds, with, parts, of, the, cdu, who, wished, to, unite, socialism, and, christianity, adenauer, worked, diligently, at, building, up, contacts, and, support, in, the, cdu, over, the, following, years, and, he, sought, with, varying, success, to, impose, his, particular, ideology, on, the, party, adenauer, s, leading, role, in, the, cdu, of, the, british, zone, won, him, a, position, at, the, parliamentary, council, of, 1948, which, had, been, called, into, existence, by, the, western, allies, to, draft, a, constitution, for, the, three, western, zones, of, germany, he, was, the, chairman, of, this, constitutional, convention, and, vaulted, from, this, position, to, being, chosen, as, the, first, head, of, government, once, the, new, basic, law, had, been, promulgated, in, may, 1949, the, first, election, to, the, bundestag, of, west, germany, was, held, on, 15, august, 1949, with, the, christian, democrats, emerging, as, the, strongest, party, there, were, two, clashing, visions, of, a, future, germany, held, by, adenauer, and, his, main, rival, the, social, democrat, kurt, schumacher, adenauer, favored, integrating, the, federal, republic, with, other, western, states, especially, france, and, the, united, states, in, order, to, fight, the, cold, war, even, if, the, price, of, this, was, the, continued, division, of, germany, schumacher, by, contrast, though, an, anti, communist, wanted, to, see, a, united, socialist, and, neutral, germany, as, such, adenauer, was, in, favor, of, joining, nato, something, that, schumacher, strongly, opposed, the, free, democrat, theodor, heuss, was, elected, the, first, president, of, the, republic, and, adenauer, was, elected, chancellor, head, of, government, on, 15, september, 1949, with, the, support, of, his, own, cdu, the, christian, social, union, the, liberal, free, democratic, party, and, the, right, wing, german, party, it, was, said, that, adenauer, was, elected, chancellor, by, the, new, german, parliament, by, a, majority, of, one, vote, his, own, at, age, 73, it, was, thought, that, adenauer, would, only, be, a, caretaker, chancellor, however, he, would, go, on, to, hold, this, post, for, 14, years, a, period, spanning, most, of, the, preliminary, phase, of, the, cold, war, during, this, period, the, post, war, division, of, germany, was, consolidated, with, the, establishment, of, two, separate, german, states, the, federal, republic, of, germany, west, germany, and, the, german, democratic, republic, east, germany, in, the, controversial, selection, for, a, provisional, capital, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, adenauer, championed, bonn, over, frankfurt, am, main, the, british, had, agreed, to, detach, bonn, from, their, zone, of, occupation, and, convert, the, area, to, an, autonomous, region, wholly, under, german, sovereignty, the, americans, were, not, prepared, to, grant, the, same, for, frankfurt, he, also, resisted, the, claims, of, heidelberg, which, had, better, communications, and, had, survived, the, war, in, better, condition, partly, because, the, nazis, had, been, popular, there, before, they, came, to, power, and, partly, as, he, said, because, the, world, would, not, take, them, seriously, if, they, set, up, their, state, in, a, city, that, was, the, setting, for, the, student, prince, at, the, time, a, popular, american, operetta, based, on, the, drinking, culture, of, german, student, fraternities, as, chancellor, adenauer, tended, to, make, most, major, decisions, himself, treating, his, ministers, as, mere, extensions, of, his, authority, while, this, tendency, decreased, under, his, successors, it, established, the, image, of, west, germany, and, later, reunified, germany, as, a, chancellor, democracy, in, a, speech, on, 20, september, 1949, adenauer, denounced, the, entire, denazification, process, pursued, by, the, allied, military, governments, announcing, in, the, same, speech, that, he, was, planning, to, bring, in, an, amnesty, law, for, the, nazi, war, criminals, and, he, planned, to, apply, to, the, high, commissioners, for, a, corresponding, amnesty, for, punishments, imposed, by, the, allied, military, courts, adenauer, argued, the, continuation, of, denazification, would, foster, a, growing, and, extreme, nationalism, as, the, millions, who, supported, the, nazi, regime, would, find, themselves, excluded, from, german, life, forever, he, also, demanded, an, end, to, this, sniffing, out, of, nazis, by, 31, january, 1951, the, amnesty, legislation, had, benefited, 792, 176, people, they, included, 3, 000, functionaries, of, the, sa, the, ss, and, the, nazi, party, who, participated, in, dragging, victims, to, jails, and, camps, 20, 000, nazis, sentenced, for, deeds, against, life, presumably, murder, 30, 000, sentenced, for, causing, bodily, injury, and, about, 5, 200, charged, with, crimes, and, misdemeanors, in, office, the, adenauer, government, refused, to, accept, the, oder, neisse, line, as, germany, s, eastern, frontier, this, refusal, was, in, large, part, motivated, by, his, desire, to, win, the, votes, of, expellees, and, right, wing, nationalists, to, the, cdu, which, is, why, he, supported, heimatrecht, i, e, the, right, of, expellees, to, return, to, their, former, homes, it, was, also, intended, to, be, a, deal, breaker, if, negotiations, ever, began, to, reunite, germany, on, terms, that, adenauer, considered, unfavorable, such, as, the, neutralization, of, germany, as, adenauer, knew, well, that, the, soviets, would, never, revise, the, oder, neisse, line, privately, adenauer, considered, germany, s, eastern, provinces, to, be, lost, forever, at, the, petersberg, agreement, in, november, 1949, he, achieved, some, of, the, first, concessions, granted, by, the, allies, such, as, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, factories, to, be, dismantled, but, in, particular, his, agreement, to, join, the, international, authority, for, the, ruhr, led, to, heavy, criticism, in, the, following, debate, in, parliament, adenauer, stated, the, allies, have, told, me, that, dismantling, would, be, stopped, only, if, i, satisfy, the, allied, desire, for, security, does, the, socialist, party, want, dismantling, to, go, on, to, the, bitter, end, the, opposition, leader, kurt, schumacher, responded, by, labeling, adenauer, chancellor, of, the, allies, accusing, adenauer, of, putting, good, relations, with, the, west, for, the, sake, of, the, cold, war, ahead, of, german, national, interests, after, a, year, of, negotiations, the, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, on, 18, april, 1951, establishing, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, the, treaty, was, unpopular, in, germany, where, it, was, seen, as, a, french, attempt, to, take, over, german, industry, the, treaty, conditions, were, favorable, to, the, french, but, for, adenauer, the, only, thing, that, mattered, was, european, integration, adenauer, was, keen, to, see, britain, join, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, as, he, believed, the, more, free, market, british, would, counterbalance, the, influence, of, the, more, dirigiste, french, and, to, achieve, that, purpose, he, visited, london, in, november, 1951, to, meet, with, prime, minister, winston, churchill, churchill, said, britain, would, not, join, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, because, doing, so, would, mean, sacrificing, relations, with, the, u, s, and, commonwealth, from, the, beginning, of, his, chancellorship, adenauer, had, been, pressing, for, german, rearmament, after, the, outbreak, of, the, korean, war, on, 25, june, 1950, the, u, s, and, britain, agreed, that, west, germany, had, to, be, rearmed, to, strengthen, the, defenses, of, western, europe, against, a, possible, soviet, invasion, further, contributing, to, the, crisis, atmosphere, of, 1950, was, the, bellicose, rhetoric, of, the, east, german, leader, walter, ulbricht, who, proclaimed, the, reunification, of, germany, under, communist, rule, to, be, imminent, to, soothe, french, fears, of, german, rearmament, the, french, premier, ren, pleven, suggested, the, so, called, pleven, plan, in, october, 1950, under, which, the, federal, republic, would, have, its, military, forces, function, as, part, of, the, armed, wing, of, the, multinational, european, defense, community, edc, adenauer, deeply, disliked, the, pleven, plan, but, was, forced, to, support, it, when, it, became, clear, that, this, plan, was, the, only, way, the, french, would, agree, to, german, rearmament, in, 1950, a, major, controversy, broke, out, when, it, emerged, that, adenauer, s, state, secretary, hans, globke, had, played, a, major, role, in, drafting, anti, semitic, nuremberg, race, laws, in, nazi, germany, adenauer, kept, globke, on, as, state, secretary, as, part, of, his, strategy, of, integration, starting, in, august, 1950, adenauer, began, to, pressure, the, western, allies, to, free, all, of, the, war, criminals, in, their, custody, especially, those, from, the, wehrmacht, whose, continued, imprisonment, he, claimed, made, west, german, rearmament, impossible, adenauer, had, been, opposed, to, the, nuremberg, trials, in, 1945, 46, and, after, becoming, chancellor, he, demanded, the, release, of, the, so, called, spandau, seven, as, the, seven, war, criminals, convicted, at, nuremberg, and, imprisoned, at, spandau, prison, were, known, in, october, 1950, adenauer, received, the, so, called, himmerod, memorandum, drafted, by, four, former, wehrmacht, generals, at, the, himmerod, abbey, that, linked, freedom, for, german, war, criminals, as, the, price, of, german, rearmament, along, with, public, statements, from, the, allies, that, the, wehrmacht, committed, no, war, crimes, in, world, war, ii, the, allies, were, willing, to, do, whatever, necessary, to, get, the, much, needed, german, rearmament, underway, and, in, january, 1951, general, dwight, eisenhower, commander, of, nato, forces, issued, a, statement, which, declared, the, great, majority, of, the, wehrmacht, had, acted, honorably, on, 2, january, 1951, adenauer, met, with, the, american, high, commissioner, john, j, mccloy, to, argue, that, executing, the, landsberg, prisoners, would, ruin, forever, any, effort, at, having, the, federal, republic, play, its, role, in, the, cold, war, at, the, time, american, occupation, authorities, had, 28, nazi, war, criminals, left, on, death, row, in, their, custody, in, response, to, adenauer, s, demands, and, pressure, from, the, german, public, mccloy, and, thomas, t, handy, on, 31, january, 1951, reduced, the, death, sentences, of, all, but, the, 7, worst, offenders, by, 1951, laws, were, passed, by, the, bundestag, ending, denazification, denazification, was, viewed, by, the, united, states, as, counterproductive, and, ineffective, and, its, demise, was, not, opposed, adenauer, s, intention, was, to, switch, government, policy, to, reparations, and, compensation, for, the, victims, of, nazi, rule, wiedergutmachung, officials, were, allowed, to, retake, jobs, in, civil, service, with, the, exception, of, people, assigned, to, group, i, major, offenders, and, ii, offenders, during, the, denazification, review, process, adenauer, pressured, his, rehabilitated, ex, nazis, by, threatening, that, stepping, out, of, line, could, trigger, the, reopening, of, individual, de, nazification, prosecutions, the, construction, of, a, competent, federal, government, effectively, from, a, standing, start, was, one, of, the, greatest, of, adenauer, s, formidable, achievements, contemporary, critics, accused, adenauer, of, cementing, the, division, of, germany, sacrificing, reunification, and, the, recovery, of, territories, lost, in, the, westward, shift, of, poland, and, the, soviet, union, with, his, determination, to, secure, the, federal, republic, to, the, west, adenauer, s, german, policy, was, based, upon, politik, der, st, rke, policy, of, strength, and, upon, the, so, called, magnet, theory, in, which, a, prosperous, democratic, west, germany, integrated, with, the, west, would, act, as, a, magnet, that, would, eventually, bring, down, the, east, german, regime, in, 1952, the, stalin, note, as, it, became, known, caught, everybody, in, the, west, by, surprise, it, offered, to, unify, the, two, german, entities, into, a, single, neutral, state, with, its, own, non, aligned, national, army, to, effect, superpower, disengagement, from, central, europe, adenauer, and, his, cabinet, were, unanimous, in, their, rejection, of, the, stalin, overture, they, shared, the, western, allies, suspicion, about, the, genuineness, of, that, offer, and, supported, the, allies, in, their, cautious, replies, adenauer, s, flat, rejection, was, however, still, out, of, step, with, public, opinion, he, then, realized, his, mistake, and, he, started, to, ask, questions, critics, denounced, him, for, having, missed, an, opportunity, for, german, reunification, the, soviets, sent, a, second, note, courteous, in, tone, adenauer, by, then, understood, that, all, opportunity, for, initiative, had, passed, out, of, his, hands, and, the, matter, was, put, to, rest, by, the, allies, given, the, realities, of, the, cold, war, german, reunification, and, recovery, of, lost, territories, in, the, east, were, not, realistic, goals, as, both, of, stalin, s, notes, specified, the, retention, of, the, existing, potsdam, decreed, boundaries, of, germany, adenauer, recognized, the, obligation, of, the, west, german, government, to, compensate, israel, as, the, main, representative, of, the, jewish, people, for, the, holocaust, west, germany, started, negotiations, with, israel, for, restitution, of, lost, property, and, the, payment, of, damages, to, victims, of, nazi, persecution, in, the, luxemburger, abkommen, west, germany, agreed, to, pay, compensation, to, israel, jewish, claims, were, bundled, in, the, jewish, claims, conference, which, represented, the, jewish, victims, of, nazi, germany, west, germany, then, initially, paid, about, 3, billion, mark, to, israel, and, about, 450, million, to, the, claims, conference, although, payments, continued, after, that, as, new, claims, were, made, in, the, face, of, severe, opposition, both, from, the, public, and, from, his, own, cabinet, adenauer, was, only, able, to, get, the, reparations, agreement, ratified, by, the, bundestag, with, the, support, of, the, spd, israeli, public, opinion, was, divided, over, accepting, the, money, but, ultimately, the, fledgling, state, under, david, ben, gurion, agreed, to, take, it, opposed, by, political, parties, such, as, herut, who, were, against, such, treaties, those, treaties, were, cited, as, a, main, reason, for, the, assassination, attempt, by, radical, jewish, groups, against, adenauer, on, 27, march, 1952, a, package, addressed, to, chancellor, adenauer, exploded, in, the, munich, police, headquarters, killing, one, bavarian, police, officer, karl, reichert, investigations, revealed, the, mastermind, behind, the, assassination, attempt, to, be, menachem, begin, who, would, later, become, the, prime, minister, of, israel, begin, had, been, the, commander, of, irgun, and, at, that, time, headed, herut, and, was, a, member, of, the, knesset, his, goal, was, to, put, pressure, on, the, german, government, and, prevent, the, signing, of, the, reparations, agreement, between, israel, and, west, germany, which, he, vehemently, opposed, the, west, german, government, kept, all, proof, under, seal, in, order, to, prevent, antisemitic, responses, from, the, german, public, when, the, east, german, uprising, of, 1953, was, harshly, suppressed, by, the, red, army, in, june, 1953, adenauer, took, political, advantage, of, the, situation, and, was, handily, re, elected, to, a, second, term, as, chancellor, the, cdu, csu, came, up, one, seat, short, of, an, outright, majority, adenauer, could, thus, have, governed, in, a, coalition, with, only, one, other, party, but, retained, gained, the, support, of, nearly, all, of, the, parties, in, the, bundestag, that, were, to, the, right, of, the, spd, the, german, restitution, laws, bundesentsch, digungsgesetz, were, passed, in, 1953, that, allowed, some, victims, of, nazi, prosecution, to, claim, restitution, under, the, 1953, restitution, law, those, who, had, suffered, for, racial, religious, or, political, reasons, could, collect, compensation, which, were, defined, in, such, a, way, as, to, sharply, limit, the, number, of, people, entitled, to, collect, compensation, in, november, 1954, adenauer, s, lobbying, efforts, on, behalf, of, the, spandau, seven, finally, bore, fruit, with, the, release, of, konstantin, von, neurath, adenauer, congratulated, neurath, on, his, release, sparking, controversy, all, over, the, world, at, the, same, time, adenauer, s, efforts, to, win, freedom, for, admiral, karl, d, nitz, ran, into, staunch, opposition, from, the, british, permanent, secretary, at, the, foreign, office, ivone, kirkpatrick, who, argued, d, nitz, would, be, an, active, danger, to, german, democracy, adenauer, then, traded, with, kirkpatrick, no, early, release, for, admiral, d, nitz, with, an, early, release, for, admiral, erich, raeder, on, medical, grounds, adenauer, is, closely, linked, to, the, implementation, of, an, enhanced, pension, system, which, ensured, unparalleled, prosperity, for, retired, people, along, with, his, minister, for, economic, affairs, and, successor, ludwig, erhard, the, west, german, model, of, a, social, market, economy, a, mixed, economy, with, capitalism, moderated, by, elements, of, social, welfare, and, catholic, social, teaching, allowed, for, the, boom, period, known, as, the, wirtschaftswunder, economic, miracle, that, produced, broad, prosperity, but, adenauer, acted, more, leniently, towards, the, trade, unions, and, employers, associations, than, erhard, the, adenauer, era, witnessed, a, dramatic, rise, in, the, standard, of, living, of, average, germans, with, real, wages, doubling, between, 1950, and, 1963, this, rising, affluence, was, accompanied, by, a, 20, fall, in, working, hours, during, that, same, period, together, with, a, fall, in, the, unemployment, rate, from, 8, in, 1950, to, 0, 4, in, 1965, in, addition, an, advanced, welfare, state, was, established, in, the, spring, of, 1954, opposition, to, the, pleven, plan, grew, within, the, french, national, assembly, and, in, august, 1954, it, died, when, an, alliance, of, conservatives, and, communists, in, the, national, assembly, joined, forces, to, reject, the, edc, treaty, under, the, grounds, that, west, german, rearmament, in, any, form, was, an, unacceptable, danger, to, france, the, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, told, adenauer, that, britain, would, ensure, that, west, german, rearmament, would, happen, regardless, if, the, national, assembly, ratified, the, edc, treaty, or, not, and, foreign, secretary, anthony, eden, used, the, failure, of, the, edc, to, argue, for, independent, west, german, rearmament, and, west, german, nato, membership, thanks, in, part, to, adenauer, s, success, in, rebuilding, west, germany, s, image, the, british, proposal, met, with, considerable, approval, in, the, ensuing, london, conference, eden, assisted, adenauer, by, promising, the, french, that, britain, would, always, maintain, at, least, four, divisions, in, the, british, army, of, the, rhine, as, long, as, there, was, a, soviet, threat, with, the, strengthened, british, forces, also, aimed, implicitly, against, any, german, revanchism, adenauer, then, promised, that, germany, would, never, seek, to, have, nuclear, chemical, and, biological, weapons, as, well, as, capital, ships, strategic, bombers, long, range, artillery, and, guided, missiles, although, these, promises, were, non, binding, the, french, had, been, assuaged, that, west, german, rearmament, would, be, no, threat, to, france, additionally, adenauer, promised, that, the, west, german, military, would, be, under, the, operational, control, of, nato, general, staff, though, ultimate, control, would, rest, with, the, west, german, government, and, that, above, all, he, would, never, violate, the, strictly, defensive, nato, charter, and, invade, east, germany, to, achieve, german, reunification, in, may, 1955, west, germany, joined, nato, and, in, november, a, west, german, military, the, bundeswehr, was, founded, though, adenauer, made, use, of, a, number, of, former, wehrmacht, generals, and, admirals, in, the, bundeswehr, he, saw, the, bundeswehr, as, a, new, force, with, no, links, to, the, past, and, wanted, it, to, be, kept, under, civilian, control, at, all, times, to, achieve, these, aims, adenauer, gave, a, great, deal, of, power, to, the, military, reformer, wolf, graf, von, baudissin, adenauer, reached, an, agreement, for, his, nuclear, ambitions, with, a, nato, military, committee, in, december, 1956, that, stipulated, west, german, forces, were, to, be, equipped, for, nuclear, warfare, concluding, that, the, united, states, would, eventually, pull, out, of, western, europe, adenauer, pursued, nuclear, cooperation, with, other, countries, the, french, government, then, proposed, that, france, west, germany, and, italy, jointly, develop, and, produce, nuclear, weapons, and, delivery, systems, and, an, agreement, was, signed, in, april, 1958, with, the, ascendancy, of, charles, de, gaulle, the, agreement, for, joint, production, and, control, was, shelved, indefinitely, president, john, f, kennedy, an, ardent, foe, of, nuclear, proliferation, considered, sales, of, such, weapons, moot, since, in, the, event, of, war, the, united, states, would, from, the, outset, be, prepared, to, defend, the, federal, republic, the, physicists, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, theoretical, physics, at, g, ttingen, and, other, renowned, universities, would, have, had, the, scientific, capability, for, in, house, development, but, the, will, was, absent, nor, was, there, public, support, with, adenauer, s, fourth, term, election, in, november, 1961, and, the, end, of, his, chancellorship, in, sight, his, nuclear, ambitions, began, to, taper, off, in, return, for, the, release, of, the, last, german, prisoners, of, war, in, 1955, the, federal, republic, established, diplomatic, relations, with, the, ussr, but, refused, to, recognize, east, germany, and, broke, off, diplomatic, relations, with, countries, e, g, yugoslavia, that, established, relations, with, the, east, german, r, gime, adenauer, was, also, ready, to, consider, the, oder, neisse, line, as, the, german, border, in, order, to, pursue, a, more, flexible, policy, with, poland, but, he, did, not, command, sufficient, domestic, support, for, this, and, opposition, to, the, oder, neisse, line, continued, causing, considerable, disappointment, among, adenauer, s, western, allies, in, 1956, during, the, suez, crisis, adenauer, fully, supported, the, anglo, french, israeli, attack, on, egypt, arguing, to, his, cabinet, that, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, was, a, pro, soviet, force, that, needed, to, be, cut, down, to, size, adenauer, was, appalled, that, the, americans, had, come, out, against, the, attack, on, egypt, alongside, the, soviets, which, led, adenauer, to, fear, that, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, would, carve, up, the, world, with, no, thought, for, european, interests, at, the, height, of, the, suez, crisis, adenauer, visited, paris, to, meet, the, french, premier, guy, mollet, in, a, show, of, moral, support, for, france, the, day, before, adenauer, arrived, in, paris, the, soviet, premier, nikolai, bulganin, sent, the, so, called, bulganin, letters, to, the, leaders, of, britain, france, and, israel, threatening, nuclear, strikes, if, they, did, not, end, the, war, against, egypt, the, news, of, the, bulganin, letters, reached, adenauer, mid, way, on, the, train, trip, to, paris, the, threat, of, a, soviet, nuclear, strike, that, could, destroy, paris, at, any, moment, added, considerably, to, the, tension, of, the, summit, the, paris, summit, helped, to, strengthen, the, bond, between, adenauer, and, the, french, who, saw, themselves, as, fellow, european, powers, living, in, a, world, dominated, by, washington, and, moscow, adenauer, was, deeply, shocked, by, the, soviet, threat, of, nuclear, strikes, against, britain, and, france, and, even, more, so, by, the, apparent, quiescent, american, response, to, the, soviet, threat, of, nuclear, annihilation, against, two, of, nato, s, key, members, as, a, result, adenauer, became, more, interested, in, the, french, idea, of, a, european, third, force, in, the, cold, war, as, an, alternative, security, policy, this, helped, to, lead, to, the, formation, of, the, european, economic, community, in, 1957, which, was, intended, to, be, the, foundation, stone, of, the, european, third, force, adenauer, s, achievements, include, the, establishment, of, a, stable, democracy, in, west, germany, and, a, lasting, reconciliation, with, france, culminating, in, the, lys, e, treaty, his, political, commitment, to, the, western, powers, achieved, full, sovereignty, for, west, germany, which, was, formally, laid, down, in, the, general, treaty, although, there, remained, allied, restrictions, concerning, the, status, of, a, potentially, reunited, germany, and, the, state, of, emergency, in, west, germany, adenauer, firmly, integrated, the, country, with, the, emerging, euro, atlantic, community, nato, and, the, organisation, for, european, economic, cooperation, in, 1957, the, saarland, was, reintegrated, into, germany, as, a, federal, state, of, the, federal, republic, the, election, of, 1957, essentially, dealt, with, national, matters, his, re, election, campaign, centered, around, the, slogan, keine, experimente, no, experiments, in, response, to, the, democratic, experimentalism, reform, proposed, by, his, opponents, riding, a, wave, of, popularity, from, the, return, of, the, last, pows, from, soviet, labor, camps, as, well, as, an, extensive, pension, reform, adenauer, led, the, cdu, csu, to, an, outright, majority, something, never, previously, achieved, in, a, free, german, election, in, 1957, the, federal, republic, signed, the, treaty, of, rome, and, became, a, founding, member, of, the, european, economic, community, in, september, 1958, adenauer, first, met, president, charles, de, gaulle, of, france, who, was, to, become, a, close, friend, and, ally, in, pursuing, franco, german, rapprochement, adenauer, saw, de, gaulle, as, a, rock, and, the, only, foreign, leader, whom, he, could, completely, trust, in, response, to, the, ulm, einsatzkommando, trial, in, 1958, adenauer, set, up, the, central, office, of, the, state, justice, administrations, for, the, investigation, of, national, socialist, crimes, on, 27, november, 1958, another, berlin, crisis, broke, out, when, khrushchev, submitted, an, ultimatum, with, a, six, month, expiry, date, to, washington, london, and, paris, where, he, demanded, that, the, allies, pull, all, their, forces, out, of, west, berlin, and, agree, that, west, berlin, become, a, free, city, or, else, he, would, sign, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, east, germany, adenauer, was, opposed, to, any, sort, of, negotiations, with, the, soviets, arguing, if, only, the, west, were, to, hang, tough, long, enough, khrushchev, would, back, down, as, the, 27, may, deadline, approached, the, crisis, was, defused, by, the, british, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, who, visited, moscow, to, meet, with, khrushchev, and, managed, to, extend, the, deadline, while, not, committing, himself, or, the, other, western, powers, to, concessions, adenauer, believed, macmillan, to, be, a, spineless, appeaser, who, had, made, a, secret, deal, with, khrushchev, at, the, expense, of, the, federal, republic, adenauer, tarnished, his, image, when, he, announced, he, would, run, for, the, office, of, federal, president, in, 1959, only, to, pull, out, when, he, discovered, that, he, did, not, have, political, backing, to, strengthen, the, office, of, president, and, change, the, balance, of, power, after, his, reversal, he, supported, the, nomination, of, heinrich, l, bke, as, the, cdu, presidential, candidate, whom, he, believed, weak, enough, not, to, interfere, with, his, actions, as, federal, chancellor, one, of, adenauer, s, reasons, for, not, pursuing, the, presidency, was, his, fear, that, ludwig, erhard, whom, adenauer, thought, little, of, would, become, the, new, chancellor, by, early, 1959, adenauer, came, under, renewed, pressure, from, his, western, allies, to, recognize, the, oder, neisse, line, with, the, americans, being, especially, insistent, adenauer, gave, his, explicit, and, unconditional, approval, to, the, idea, of, non, aggression, pacts, in, late, january, 1959, which, effectively, meant, recognising, the, oder, neisse, line, since, realistically, speaking, germany, could, only, regain, the, lost, territories, through, force, after, adenauer, s, intention, to, sign, non, aggression, pacts, with, poland, and, czechoslovakia, became, clear, the, german, expellee, lobby, swung, into, action, and, organized, protests, all, over, the, federal, republic, while, bombarding, the, offices, of, adenauer, and, other, members, of, the, cabinet, with, thousands, of, letters, telegrams, and, telephone, calls, promising, never, to, vote, cdu, again, if, the, non, aggression, pacts, were, signed, faced, with, this, pressure, adenauer, promptly, capitulated, to, the, expellee, lobby, in, late, 1959, a, controversy, broke, out, when, it, emerged, that, theodor, oberl, nder, the, minister, of, refugees, since, 1953, and, one, of, the, most, powerful, leaders, of, the, expellee, lobby, had, committed, war, crimes, against, jews, and, poles, during, world, war, ii, despite, his, past, on, 10, december, 1959, a, statement, was, released, to, the, press, declaring, that, dr, oberl, nder, has, the, full, confidence, of, the, adenauer, cabinet, other, christian, democrats, made, it, clear, to, adenauer, that, they, would, like, to, see, oberl, nder, out, of, the, cabinet, and, finally, in, may, 1960, oberl, nder, resigned, in, 1961, adenauer, had, his, concerns, about, both, the, status, of, berlin, and, us, leadership, confirmed, as, the, soviets, and, east, germans, built, the, berlin, wall, adenauer, had, come, into, the, year, distrusting, the, new, us, president, john, f, kennedy, he, doubted, kennedy, s, commitment, to, a, free, berlin, and, a, unified, germany, and, considered, him, undisciplined, and, na, ve, for, his, part, kennedy, thought, that, adenauer, was, a, relic, of, the, past, their, strained, relationship, impeded, effective, western, action, on, berlin, during, 1961, the, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, in, august, 1961, and, the, sealing, of, borders, by, the, east, germans, made, adenauer, s, government, look, weak, adenauer, continued, his, campaign, trail, and, made, a, disastrous, misjudgement, in, a, speech, on, 14, august, 1961, in, regensburg, with, a, personal, attack, on, the, spd, lead, candidate, willy, brandt, lord, mayor, of, west, berlin, saying, that, brandt, s, illegitimate, birth, had, disqualified, him, from, holding, any, sort, of, office, after, failing, to, keep, their, majority, in, the, general, election, on, 17, september, the, cdu, csu, again, needed, to, include, the, fdp, in, a, coalition, government, adenauer, was, forced, to, make, two, concessions, to, relinquish, the, chancellorship, before, the, end, of, the, new, term, his, fourth, and, to, replace, his, foreign, minister, in, his, last, years, in, office, adenauer, used, to, take, a, nap, after, lunch, and, when, he, was, traveling, abroad, and, had, a, public, function, to, attend, he, sometimes, asked, for, a, bed, in, a, room, close, to, where, he, was, supposed, to, be, speaking, so, that, he, could, rest, briefly, before, he, appeared, during, this, time, adenauer, came, into, conflict, with, the, economics, minister, ludwig, erhard, over, the, depth, of, german, integration, to, the, west, erhard, was, in, favor, of, allowing, britain, to, join, to, create, a, trans, atlantic, free, trade, zone, while, adenauer, was, for, strengthening, ties, amongst, the, original, founding, six, nations, of, west, germany, france, the, netherlands, belgium, luxembourg, and, italy, in, adenauer, s, viewpoint, the, cold, war, meant, that, the, nato, alliance, with, the, united, states, and, britain, was, essential, but, there, could, be, no, deeper, integration, into, a, trans, atlantic, community, beyond, the, existing, military, ties, as, that, would, lead, to, a, mishmash, between, different, cultural, systems, that, would, be, doomed, to, failure, though, adenauer, had, tried, to, get, britain, to, join, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, in, 1951, 52, by, the, early, 1960s, adenauer, had, come, to, share, general, de, gaulle, s, belief, that, britain, simply, did, not, belong, in, the, eec, the, lys, e, treaty, was, signed, in, january, 1963, to, solidify, relations, with, france, in, october, 1962, a, scandal, erupted, when, police, arrested, five, der, spiegel, journalists, charging, them, with, espionage, for, publishing, a, memo, detailing, weaknesses, in, the, west, german, armed, forces, adenauer, had, not, initiated, the, arrests, but, initially, defended, the, person, responsible, defense, minister, franz, josef, strauss, and, called, the, spiegel, memo, abyss, of, treason, after, public, outrage, and, heavy, protests, from, the, coalition, partner, fdp, he, dismissed, strauss, but, the, reputation, of, adenauer, and, his, party, had, already, suffered, adenauer, managed, to, remain, in, office, for, almost, another, year, but, the, scandal, increased, the, pressure, already, on, him, to, fulfill, his, promise, to, resign, before, the, end, of, the, term, adenauer, was, not, on, good, terms, in, his, last, years, of, power, with, his, economics, minister, ludwig, erhard, and, tried, to, block, him, from, the, chancellorship, in, january, 1963, adenauer, privately, supported, general, charles, de, gaulle, s, veto, of, britain, s, attempt, to, join, the, european, economic, community, and, was, only, prevented, from, saying, so, openly, by, the, need, to, preserve, unity, in, his, cabinet, as, most, of, his, ministers, led, by, erhard, supported, britain, s, application, a, francophile, adenauer, saw, a, franco, german, partnership, as, the, key, for, european, peace, and, prosperity, and, shared, de, gaulle, s, view, that, britain, would, be, a, disputative, force, in, the, eec, adenauer, failed, in, his, efforts, to, block, erhard, as, his, successor, and, in, october, 1963, he, turned, the, office, over, to, erhard, he, remained, chairman, of, the, cdu, until, his, resignation, in, december, 1966, adenauer, ensured, a, generally, free, and, democratic, society, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, germany, to, re, enter, the, community, of, nations, and, to, evolve, as, a, dependable, member, of, the, western, world, the, british, historian, frederick, taylor, argued, that, in, many, ways, the, adenauer, era, was, a, transition, period, in, values, and, viewpoints, from, the, authoritarianism, that, characterized, germany, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, to, the, more, democratic, values, that, characterized, the, western, half, of, germany, in,
