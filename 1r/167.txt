filippo, di, ser, brunellesco, di, lippo, lapi, 1377, 15, april, 1446, commonly, known, as, filippo, brunelleschi, b, r, u, n, l, s, k, i, broo, n, lesk, ee, italian, and, also, nicknamed, pippo, by, leon, battista, alberti, was, an, italian, architect, designer, goldsmith, and, sculptor, he, is, considered, to, be, a, founding, father, of, renaissance, architecture, he, is, recognized, as, the, first, modern, engineer, planner, and, sole, construction, supervisor, in, 1421, brunelleschi, became, the, first, person, to, receive, a, patent, in, the, western, world, he, is, most, famous, for, designing, the, dome, of, the, florence, cathedral, and, for, the, mathematical, technique, of, linear, perspective, in, art, which, governed, pictorial, depictions, of, space, until, the, late, 19th, century, and, influenced, the, rise, of, modern, science, his, accomplishments, also, include, other, architectural, works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and, ship, design, most, surviving, works, can, be, found, in, florence, brunelleschi, was, born, in, florence, italy, in, 1377, his, father, was, brunellesco, di, lippo, born, c, 1331, a, notary, and, civil, servant, his, mother, was, giuliana, spini, he, had, two, brothers, the, family, was, well, off, the, palace, of, the, spini, family, still, exists, across, from, the, church, of, the, trinit, in, florence, the, young, filippo, was, given, a, literary, and, mathematical, education, to, enable, him, to, follow, the, father, s, career, being, artistically, inclined, however, filippo, at, the, age, of, fifteen, was, apprenticed, at, the, arte, della, seta, the, silk, merchants, guild, the, wealthiest, and, most, prestigious, guild, in, the, city, which, also, included, jewellers, and, metal, craftsmen, in, december, 1398, he, became, a, master, goldsmith, and, a, sculptor, working, with, cast, bronze, brunelleschi, s, earliest, surviving, sculptures, are, two, small, bronze, statues, of, evangelists, and, saints, 1399, 1400, made, for, the, altar, of, the, crucifix, chapel, pistoia, cathedral, he, paused, this, project, in, 1400, when, he, was, chosen, to, simultaneously, serve, two, representative, councils, of, the, florentine, government, for, about, four, months, around, the, end, of, 1400, the, city, of, florence, decided, to, create, new, sculpted, and, gilded, bronze, doors, for, the, florence, baptistery, a, competition, was, held, in, 1401, for, the, design, which, drew, seven, competitors, including, brunelleschi, and, another, young, sculptor, lorenzo, ghiberti, each, sculptor, had, to, produce, a, single, bronze, panel, depicting, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, within, a, gothic, four, leaf, frame, the, panels, each, contained, abraham, isaac, an, angel, and, other, figures, imagined, by, the, artists, and, had, to, harmonize, in, style, with, the, existing, doors, produced, in, 1330, by, andrea, pisano, the, head, of, the, jury, was, giovanni, di, bicci, de, medici, who, later, became, an, important, patron, of, brunelleschi, the, jury, initially, praised, ghiberti, s, panel, when, they, saw, brunelleschi, s, work, they, were, unable, to, choose, between, the, two, and, suggested, that, the, two, artists, collaborate, on, the, project, brunelleschi, refused, to, forfeit, total, control, of, the, project, preferring, it, to, be, awarded, to, ghiberti, this, divided, public, opinion, brunelleschi, would, eventually, abandon, sculpture, and, devote, his, attention, entirely, to, architecture, and, optics, but, continued, to, receive, sculpture, commissions, until, at, least, 1416, during, the, early, renaissance, there, was, a, growing, interest, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, art, compared, to, medieval, art, which, was, largely, dominated, by, byzantine, art, initially, this, cultural, interest, was, borne, by, a, few, scholars, writers, and, philosophers, it, later, became, more, influential, across, the, visual, arts, in, this, period, 1402, 1404, brunelleschi, visited, rome, almost, certainly, accompanied, by, his, younger, friend, the, sculptor, donatello, to, study, its, ancient, ruins, donatello, may, have, been, trained, as, a, goldsmith, like, brunelleschi, and, later, worked, in, the, studio, of, ghiberti, although, the, glories, of, ancient, rome, were, a, matter, of, popular, discourse, at, the, time, few, people, had, actually, studied, the, physical, conditions, of, its, ruins, in, any, detail, until, brunelleschi, and, donatello, did, so, brunelleschi, s, study, of, classical, roman, architecture, influenced, his, building, designs, including, even, lighting, the, minimization, of, distinct, architectural, elements, within, a, building, and, the, balancing, of, those, elements, to, homogenize, the, space, it, has, been, speculated, that, brunelleschi, developed, his, system, of, linear, perspective, after, observing, the, roman, ruins, however, some, historians, dispute, that, he, visited, rome, then, given, the, number, of, projects, brunelleschi, had, in, florence, at, the, time, the, poverty, and, lack, of, security, in, rome, during, that, period, and, the, lack, of, evidence, of, the, visit, his, first, definitively, documented, visit, to, rome, was, in, 1432, brunelleschi, s, first, architectural, commission, was, the, ospedale, degli, innocenti, 1419, c, 1445, or, foundling, hospital, designed, as, a, home, for, orphans, the, guild, of, the, silk, merchants, guild, owned, funded, and, managed, the, hospital, as, with, many, of, brunelleschi, s, architectural, projects, the, building, was, completed, after, a, significant, time, lapse, and, with, considerable, modifications, by, other, architects, he, was, the, official, architect, until, 1427, but, he, was, rarely, on, site, after, 1423, the, hospital, was, completed, by, the, florentine, architect, francesco, della, luna, in, 1445, the, major, portion, completed, by, brunelleschi, was, an, arcade, or, loggia, with, nine, arches, supported, on, each, side, by, pilasters, which, gave, the, appearance, of, columns, and, opening, to, the, interior, by, a, small, door, the, arcade, was, supported, by, slender, columns, with, corinthian, capitals, this, first, arcade, with, its, columns, rounded, arches, and, simple, classical, decoration, became, an, established, model, for, numerous, renaissance, buildings, across, europe, its, long, loggia, and, the, 8m, high, arches, were, an, outstanding, sight, along, the, narrow, and, bending, streets, of, florence, the, building, s, style, was, dignified, and, sober, with, no, displays, of, fine, marble, or, decorative, inlays, it, was, also, the, first, building, in, florence, to, make, clear, reference, in, its, columns, and, capitals, to, classical, antiquity, thereafter, brunelleschi, was, awarded, additional, commissions, like, the, ridolfi, chapel, in, the, church, of, san, jacopo, sopr, arno, not, surviving, and, the, barbadori, chapel, in, santa, felicita, since, modified, in, both, projects, brunelleschi, devised, elements, already, used, in, the, ospedale, degli, innocenti, and, which, would, also, be, used, in, the, pazzi, chapel, and, the, sagrestia, vecchia, he, was, using, these, relatively, small, projects, to, pilot, ideas, which, he, would, later, employ, in, his, most, famous, work, the, dome, of, the, cathedral, of, florence, brunelleschi, undertook, the, major, project, of, the, basilica, of, san, lorenzo, soon, after, he, had, begun, the, foundling, hospital, the, basilica, was, the, largest, church, in, florence, sponsored, by, the, medici, family, the, church, hosted, the, family, s, mausoleum, numerous, architects, worked, at, the, church, including, later, michelangelo, brunelleschi, designed, the, central, nave, with, the, two, collateral, naves, on, either, side, lined, by, small, chapels, and, the, old, sacristy, the, first, stage, of, the, project, was, the, old, sacristy, built, between, 1419, and, 1429, it, contains, the, tomb, of, giovanni, di, bicci, de, medici, and, his, wife, beneath, a, central, dome, simply, decorated, the, chapel, is, a, cube, of, about, 11, metres, 36, feet, on, each, side, covered, with, a, hemispheric, dome, a, level, of, ornamental, entablements, divides, the, vertical, space, into, two, parts, and, pilasters, support, the, dome, the, altar, is, set, into, a, recess, at, one, end, beneath, a, smaller, dome, all, of, the, arcs, of, the, ceiling, are, supported, by, pilasters, like, classical, columns, set, into, the, walls, this, room, using, classical, elements, in, an, innovative, way, established, itself, as, a, standard, in, renaissance, interior, architecture, along, the, nave, slender, columns, with, corinthian, capitals, replaced, the, massive, pillars, of, gothic, architecture, a, coffered, ceiling, of, square, compartments, with, delicately, gilded, trim, replaced, the, traditional, vaulted, ceiling, of, the, central, nave, circular, windows, above, each, chapel, were, introduced, to, bridge, the, difference, in, height, between, the, low, chapels, and, the, much, higher, nave, the, new, interior, projected, an, impression, of, harmony, and, balance, brunelleschi, used, white, walls, in, the, old, sacristy, which, later, became, a, common, element, of, renaissance, architecture, leon, battista, alberti, who, wrote, in, 1450, the, standard, text, of, renaissance, art, argued, that, since, classical, times, according, to, prominent, authors, like, cicero, and, plato, white, was, the, only, color, suitable, for, a, temple, or, church, and, praised, the, purity, and, simplicity, of, the, color, like, that, of, life, the, basilica, of, santo, spirito, in, florence, was, his, next, major, project, which, characteristically, he, carried, out, in, parallel, with, his, other, major, works, though, he, began, designing, in, 1434, construction, did, not, begin, until, 1436, and, continued, beyond, his, lifetime, the, columns, for, the, facade, were, not, delivered, until, 1446, ten, days, before, his, death, and, the, facade, was, not, completed, until, 1482, and, then, was, modified, in, the, 18th, century, the, bell, tower, was, also, a, later, addition, santo, spirito, is, an, example, of, the, mathematical, proportion, and, harmony, of, brunelleschi, s, work, the, church, is, in, the, form, of, a, cross, the, choir, the, two, arms, of, the, transept, and, the, space, in, the, center, of, the, transept, are, composed, of, squares, exactly, the, same, size, the, continuation, of, the, nave, contains, four, more, identical, squares, and, a, half, square, a, later, addition, at, the, end, the, length, of, the, transept, is, exactly, one, one, half, of, the, length, of, the, nave, each, square, of, the, lower, collateral, naves, is, one, quarter, the, size, of, the, squares, in, the, principal, nave, the, collateral, naves, are, lined, with, thirty, eight, small, chapels, which, were, later, filled, with, altars, decorated, with, works, of, art, the, vertical, plan, is, also, perfectly, in, proportion, the, height, of, the, central, nave, is, exactly, twice, its, width, and, the, height, of, the, collateral, naves, on, either, side, are, exactly, twice, their, width, other, aspects, of, his, original, plan, however, were, modified, after, his, death, the, main, aisle, of, the, nave, lined, by, columns, with, corinthian, capitals, is, topped, by, a, row, of, semicircular, arches, like, his, galleries, his, original, plan, called, the, ceiling, of, the, nave, to, be, composed, of, a, barrel, vault, which, would, have, echoed, the, collateral, naves, but, this, was, also, changed, after, his, death, to, the, flat, coffered, ceiling, little, remains, of, the, exterior, walls, that, he, had, planned, they, were, unfinished, at, his, death, and, were, covered, with, a, facade, in, a, different, style, in, the, baroque, period, the, pazzi, chapel, in, florence, was, commissioned, in, about, 1429, by, andrea, pazzi, to, serve, as, the, chapter, house, or, meeting, place, of, the, monks, of, the, monastery, of, santa, croce, like, nearly, all, of, his, works, the, actual, construction, was, delayed, beginning, only, in, 1442, and, the, interior, was, not, finished, until, 1444, the, building, was, not, entirely, finished, until, about, 1469, twenty, years, after, his, death, some, of, the, details, such, as, the, lantern, on, top, of, the, dome, were, added, after, his, death, the, portico, of, the, chapel, is, especially, notable, for, its, fine, proportions, simplicity, and, harmony, its, centerpiece, is, a, sort, of, arch, of, triumph, its, six, columns, are, by, an, entablature, sculpted, medallions, an, upper, level, divided, by, pilasters, and, a, central, arch, and, another, band, of, sculpted, entablature, the, top, below, a, terrace, and, the, simple, cupola, the, interior, spaces, are, framed, by, arches, entablatures, and, pilasters, the, floor, is, also, divided, into, geometric, sections, light, comes, downward, from, the, circular, windows, of, the, dome, and, changes, throughout, the, day, the, interior, is, given, touches, of, color, by, circular, blue, and, white, ceramic, plaques, made, by, the, sculptor, luca, della, robbia, the, architecture, of, the, chapel, is, based, on, an, arrangement, of, rectangles, rather, than, squares, which, makes, it, appear, slightly, less, balanced, than, his, chapel, in, the, old, sacristy, of, san, lorenzo, santa, maria, degli, angeli, was, an, unfinished, project, by, brunelleschi, which, introduced, a, revolutionary, concept, in, renaissance, architecture, churches, since, the, romanesque, and, gothic, periods, were, traditionally, in, the, form, of, a, cross, with, the, altar, in, the, transept, or, crossing, point, santa, maria, deli, angeli, was, designed, as, a, rotunda, in, an, octagon, shape, with, eight, equal, sides, each, containing, a, chapel, and, the, altar, in, the, center, the, financing, of, the, church, came, from, the, legacy, of, two, florentine, merchants, matteo, and, andrea, scolari, and, construction, commenced, in, 1434, however, in, 1437, the, money, for, the, church, was, seized, by, the, florentine, government, to, help, finance, a, war, against, the, neighboring, city, of, lucca, the, structure, which, had, reached, a, height, of, 7, m, 23, ft, was, never, completed, as, brunelleschi, designed, it, the, completed, part, was, later, integrated, into, a, later, church, of, a, different, design, the, plans, and, model, of, brunelleschi, s, church, disappeared, and, it, is, known, only, from, an, illustration, in, the, codex, rustichi, from, 1450, and, from, drawings, of, other, architects, leon, battista, alberti, in, his, de, re, aedificatoria, the, first, major, treatise, on, renaissance, architecture, written, in, about, 1455, and, published, in, 1485, hailed, the, design, as, the, first, complete, plan, of, a, renaissance, church, leonardo, da, vinci, visited, florence, in, about, 1490, studied, brunelleschi, s, churches, and, plans, and, sketched, a, plan, for, a, similar, octagonal, church, with, radiating, chapels, in, his, notebooks, it, reached, its, fruition, on, an, even, larger, scale, in, the, 16th, century, donato, bramante, proposed, a, similar, central, plan, with, radiating, chapels, for, his, tempieto, and, later, on, an, even, larger, scale, in, his, plan, for, saint, peter, s, basilica, 1485, 1514, the, central, plan, was, finally, realized, with, some, modifications, beginning, in, 1547, in, saint, peter, s, by, michelangelo, and, then, its, completed, version, by, carlo, maderna, santa, maria, del, fiore, was, the, cathedral, and, symbol, of, florence, which, had, been, begun, in, 1296, after, the, death, of, the, first, architect, arnolfo, di, cambio, work, was, interrupted, for, fifty, years, the, campanile, or, bell, tower, was, added, by, giotto, soon, after, 1330, between, 1334, and, 1366, a, committee, of, architects, and, painters, made, a, plan, of, a, proposed, dome, and, the, constructors, were, sworn, to, follow, the, plan, the, proposed, dome, from, the, base, to, the, lantern, on, top, was, more, than, 80, m, 260, ft, high, and, the, octagonal, base, was, almost, 42, m, 138, ft, in, diameter, it, was, larger, than, the, dome, of, the, ancient, pantheon, or, any, other, dome, in, europe, and, no, dome, of, that, size, had, been, built, since, antiquity, a, competition, was, held, in, 1418, to, select, the, builder, and, other, competitors, included, his, old, rival, ghiberti, it, was, won, by, brunelleschi, with, the, help, of, a, brick, scale, model, of, the, dome, made, for, him, by, his, friend, the, sculptor, donatello, since, buttresses, were, forbidden, by, the, city, fathers, and, because, obtaining, rafters, for, scaffolding, long, and, strong, enough, and, in, sufficient, quantity, for, the, task, was, impossible, how, a, dome, of, that, size, could, be, constructed, without, its, collapsing, under, its, own, weight, was, unclear, furthermore, the, stresses, of, compression, were, not, clearly, understood, and, the, mortars, used, in, the, period, would, set, only, after, several, days, keeping, the, strain, on, the, scaffolding, for, a, long, time, the, work, on, the, dome, built, 1420, 1436, the, lantern, built, 1446, c, 1461, and, the, exedra, built, 1439, 1445, occupied, most, of, the, remainder, of, brunelleschi, s, life, brunelleschi, s, success, can, be, attributed, to, his, technical, and, mathematical, genius, brunelleschi, used, more, than, four, million, bricks, in, the, construction, of, the, octagonal, dome, notably, brunelleschi, left, behind, no, building, plans, or, diagrams, detailing, the, dome, s, structure, scholars, surmise, that, he, constructed, the, dome, as, though, it, were, hemispherical, which, would, have, allowed, the, dome, to, support, itself, brunelleschi, constructed, two, domes, one, within, the, other, a, practice, that, would, later, be, followed, by, all, the, successive, major, domes, including, those, of, les, invalides, in, paris, and, the, united, states, capitol, in, washington, the, outer, dome, protected, the, inner, dome, from, the, rain, and, allowed, a, higher, and, more, majestic, form, the, frame, of, the, dome, is, composed, of, twenty, eight, horizontal, and, vertical, marble, ribs, or, eperoni, eight, of, which, are, visible, on, the, outside, those, visible, on, the, outside, are, largely, decorative, since, the, outer, dome, is, supported, by, the, structure, of, the, inner, dome, a, narrow, stairway, runs, upward, between, the, two, domes, to, the, lantern, on, the, top, older, examples, of, double, shelled, domes, include, the, 50m, tall, dome, of, soltaniyeh, and, the, mausoleum, of, khoja, ahmed, yasawi, brunelleschi, invented, a, new, hoisting, machine, for, raising, the, masonry, needed, for, the, dome, a, task, no, doubt, inspired, by, republication, of, vitruvius, de, architectura, which, describes, roman, machines, used, in, the, first, century, ad, to, build, large, structures, such, as, the, pantheon, and, the, baths, of, diocletian, structures, still, standing, which, he, would, have, seen, for, himself, this, hoisting, machine, would, be, admired, by, leonardo, da, vinci, years, later, the, strength, of, the, dome, was, improved, by, the, wooden, and, sandstone, chains, invented, by, brunelleschi, which, acted, like, tensioning, rings, around, the, base, of, the, dome, and, reduced, the, need, for, flying, buttresses, so, popular, in, gothic, architecture, the, herringbone, brick, laying, pattern, which, brunelleschi, may, have, seen, in, rome, was, also, seemingly, forgotten, in, europe, before, the, construction, of, the, dome, brunelleschi, kept, his, workers, up, in, the, building, during, their, breaks, and, brought, food, and, diluted, wine, similar, to, that, given, to, pregnant, women, at, the, time, up, to, them, he, felt, the, trip, up, and, down, the, hundreds, of, stairs, would, exhaust, them, and, reduce, their, productivity, once, the, dome, was, completed, a, new, competition, was, held, in, 1436, for, the, decorative, lantern, on, top, of, the, dome, once, again, against, his, old, rival, ghiberti, brunelleschi, won, the, competition, and, designed, the, structure, and, built, the, base, for, the, lantern, but, he, did, not, live, long, enough, to, see, its, final, installation, atop, the, dome, in, 1438, brunelleschi, designed, his, last, contribution, to, the, cathedral, four, hemispherical, exedra, or, small, half, domes, based, on, a, roman, model, set, against, the, drum, at, the, base, of, the, main, dome, they, alternated, the, four, small, domes, arranged, around, the, main, dome, and, gave, the, appearance, of, a, stairway, of, domes, mounting, upward, they, were, purely, decorative, and, were, richly, decorated, with, horizontal, entablatures, and, vertical, arches, pilasters, and, double, columns, even, though, decoration, was, the, forefront, of, motivation, for, the, design, the, technological, advancements, of, gunpowder, and, portable, cannons, required, a, new, system, of, fortification, which, led, to, further, development, of, the, double, shelled, dome, their, architectural, elements, inspired, later, high, renaissance, architecture, including, the, tempietto, of, st, peter, built, at, montorio, by, bramante, 1502, a, similar, structure, appears, the, painting, of, an, ideal, city, attributed, to, piero, della, francesca, at, urbino, about, 1475, the, new, designs, fulfilled, the, need, for, architectural, status, for, ruling, kings, and, princes, with, the, strong, dome, structure, protecting, their, interests, and, bloodline, besides, his, accomplishments, in, architecture, brunelleschi, is, also, credited, as, the, first, person, to, describe, a, precise, system, of, linear, perspective, this, revolutionized, painting, and, opened, the, way, for, the, naturalistic, styles, of, renaissance, art, he, systematically, studied, how, and, why, objects, buildings, and, landscapes, changed, and, lines, appeared, to, change, shape, when, seen, from, a, distance, or, from, different, angles, he, produced, drawings, in, perspective, of, the, baptistry, in, florence, place, san, giovanni, and, other, florence, landmarks, according, to, his, early, biographers, giorgio, vasari, and, antonio, manetti, brunelleschi, conducted, experiments, between, 1415, and, 1420, including, making, paintings, with, perspectives, of, the, florence, baptistery, and, the, palazzo, vecchio, seen, obliquely, from, its, northwest, corner, as, well, as, the, buildings, of, place, san, giovanni, according, to, manetti, he, used, a, grid, to, guide, the, drawing, of, the, scene, square, by, square, and, produced, a, reverse, image, he, mathematically, calculated, a, scale, for, the, objects, in, the, drawing, to, make, them, appear, more, accurately, thus, discovering, a, system, to, represent, three, dimensional, objects, on, a, two, dimensional, surface, the, results, were, compositions, with, accurate, perspective, as, seen, through, a, mirror, to, compare, the, accuracy, of, his, image, with, the, real, object, he, made, a, small, hole, in, his, painting, and, had, an, observer, look, through, the, back, of, his, painting, to, observe, the, scene, a, mirror, was, then, raised, reflecting, brunelleschi, s, composition, and, the, observer, saw, the, striking, similarity, between, the, reality, and, painting, both, panels, have, since, been, lost, brunelleschi, s, studies, on, perspective, were, extended, by, leon, battista, alberti, piero, della, francesca, and, leonardo, da, vinci, following, the, rules, of, perspective, studied, by, brunelleschi, and, the, others, artists, could, paint, imaginary, landscapes, and, scenes, with, accurate, three, dimensional, perspective, and, realism, the, most, important, treatise, on, painting, of, the, renaissance, della, pittura, libri, tre, by, alberti, with, a, description, of, brunelleschi, s, experiment, was, published, in, 1436, and, was, dedicated, to, brunelleschi, this, technical, innovation, by, brunelleschi, enabled, to, reproduce, in, paintings, accurate, three, dimensional, views, of, the, world, the, painting, the, holy, trinity, by, masaccio, 1425, 1427, in, the, santa, maria, novella, florence, is, a, renowned, example, of, the, new, technique, which, accurately, created, the, illusion, of, a, three, dimensional, representation, and, also, recreated, in, painting, brunelleschi, s, architectural, style, this, development, established, the, standard, method, of, painting, studied, by, artists, until, the, 19th, century, in, 1421, brunelleschi, was, granted, what, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, first, modern, patents, for, his, invention, of, a, river, transport, vessel, that, was, said, to, bring, in, any, merchandise, and, load, on, the, river, arno, etc, for, less, money, than, usual, and, with, several, other, benefits, it, was, intended, to, be, used, to, transport, marble, in, the, history, of, patent, law, brunelleschi, is, therefore, accorded, a, special, place, in,
