portuguese, india, not, for, humanitarian, reasons, which, were, contrary, to, his, nature, but, because, they, were, necessary, labor, workforce, in, brazil, at, the, same, time, he, encouraged, the, trade, in, black, slaves, the, pieces, in, the, terms, of, that, time, to, that, colony, and, two, companies, were, founded, with, the, support, and, direct, involvement, of, the, marqu, s, de, pombal, the, companhia, do, gr, o, par, and, maranh, o, and, the, companhia, geral, de, pernambuco, e, para, ba, whose, main, activity, was, precisely, the, trafficking, of, slaves, mostly, africans, to, brazilian, lands, the, list, of, shareholders, of, the, two, companies, included, in, addition, to, the, marquis, many, nobles, and, clergy, between, 1757, and, 1777, a, total, of, 25, 365, black, slaves, were, imported, to, par, and, maranh, o, coming, from, west, african, ports, he, reorganised, the, army, and, the, navy, and, ended, the, limpeza, de, sangue, cleanliness, of, blood, civil, statutes, and, their, discrimination, against, new, christians, the, jews, that, had, converted, to, christianity, to, escape, the, portuguese, inquisition, and, their, descendants, regardless, of, genealogical, distance, the, pombaline, reforms, were, a, series, of, reforms, intended, to, make, portugal, economically, self, sufficient, by, means, of, expanding, brazilian, territory, streamlining, the, administration, of, colonial, brazil, and, fiscal, and, economic, reforms, both, in, the, colony, and, in, portugal, however, these, encountered, difficulties, and, ultimately, failed, in, modernizing, both, the, portuguese, and, the, brazilian, economies, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, portugal, was, considered, small, and, unprogressive, it, was, a, country, of, three, million, people, in, 1750, the, economy, of, portugal, before, the, reforms, was, a, relatively, stable, one, though, it, had, become, dependent, on, colonial, brazil, for, much, of, its, economic, support, and, england, for, much, of, its, manufacturing, support, based, on, the, methuen, treaty, of, 1703, even, exports, from, portugal, went, mostly, through, expatriate, merchants, like, the, english, port, wine, shippers, and, french, businessmen, like, j, come, ratton, whose, memoirs, are, scathing, about, the, efficiency, of, his, portuguese, counterparts, the, need, to, grow, a, manufacturing, sector, in, portugal, was, made, more, imperative, by, the, excessive, spending, of, the, portuguese, crown, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, the, expenditures, on, wars, with, spain, for, south, american, territories, and, the, exhaustion, of, gold, mines, and, diamond, mines, in, brazil, his, greatest, reforms, were, however, economic, and, financial, with, the, creation, of, several, companies, and, guilds, to, regulate, every, commercial, activity, he, created, the, douro, wine, company, which, demarcated, the, douro, wine, region, for, production, of, port, to, ensure, the, wine, s, quality, his, was, the, second, attempt, to, control, wine, quality, and, production, in, europe, after, the, tokaj, region, of, hungary, he, ruled, with, a, heavy, hand, imposing, strict, laws, upon, all, classes, of, portuguese, society, from, the, high, nobility, to, the, poorest, working, class, and, via, his, widespread, review, of, the, country, s, tax, system, these, reforms, gained, him, enemies, in, the, upper, classes, especially, among, the, high, nobility, who, despised, him, as, a, social, upstart, but, also, from, the, common, people, who, saw, the, centralization, and, control, of, the, wine, production, as, harmful, to, their, own, businesses, after, the, company, was, established, in, the, city, of, porto, several, riots, began, in, the, city, against, pombal, s, reforms, the, rioteers, even, managed, to, barge, their, way, inside, the, company, s, headquarters, and, take, the, director, of, the, company, as, a, hostage, the, riots, were, eventually, calmed, but, pombal, s, brutality, was, once, more, shown, when, he, ordered, the, main, rioteers, to, be, executed, and, their, bodies, displayed, above, porto, s, medieval, gates, after, a, few, months, of, not, being, allowed, to, take, the, bodies, down, the, bishop, of, porto, had, to, officially, ask, the, king, to, allow, the, bodies, to, be, put, to, rest, further, important, reforms, were, carried, out, in, education, by, pombal, he, expelled, the, jesuits, in, 1759, created, the, basis, for, secular, public, primary, and, secondary, schools, introduced, vocational, training, created, hundreds, of, new, teaching, posts, added, departments, of, mathematics, and, natural, sciences, to, the, university, of, coimbra, closed, university, of, evora, and, introduced, new, taxes, to, pay, for, these, reforms, however, many, of, these, reforms, were, a, complete, failure, as, the, old, jesuits, schools, were, not, adequately, replaced, and, it, took, over, one, century, to, recover, the, same, levels, of, literacy, in, portugal, disaster, fell, upon, portugal, on, the, morning, of, 1, november, 1755, when, lisbon, was, awakened, by, a, violent, earthquake, with, an, estimated, magnitude, of, 9, on, the, richter, scale, the, city, was, razed, by, the, earthquake, and, ensuing, tsunami, and, fires, pombal, survived, by, a, stroke, of, luck, and, unshaken, immediately, took, upon, the, task, of, rebuilding, the, city, with, his, famous, quote, what, now, we, bury, the, dead, and, heal, the, living, despite, the, calamity, lisbon, suffered, no, epidemics, and, within, less, than, a, year, was, already, partially, rebuilt, this, rapid, recovery, can, be, attributed, to, the, quick, response, on, the, part, of, the, marquis, to, enact, several, providences, with, the, aim, of, stabilizing, the, situation, and, helping, the, inhabitants, of, lisbon, the, new, central, area, of, lisbon, was, designed, by, a, group, of, architects, specifically, to, resist, subsequent, earthquakes, employing, a, new, construction, method, caging, which, consisted, of, a, wooden, framework, erected, in, the, early, stages, of, construction, granting, the, building, a, better, chance, of, withstanding, an, earthquake, due, to, the, inherent, flexibility, of, the, material, architectural, models, were, built, for, tests, with, the, effects, of, an, earthquake, being, simulated, by, marching, troops, around, the, models, the, buildings, and, major, squares, of, the, pombaline, downtown, of, lisbon, are, one, of, its, main, attractions, they, are, the, world, s, first, earthquake, resistant, buildings, pombal, also, ordered, a, pioneering, survey, that, was, sent, to, every, parish, in, the, country, with, several, questions, including, about, the, earthquake, the, parochial, memories, of, 1758, the, questionnaire, asked, whether, dogs, or, other, animals, behaved, strangely, prior, to, the, earthquake, whether, there, was, a, noticeable, difference, in, the, rise, or, fall, of, the, water, level, in, wells, and, how, many, buildings, had, been, destroyed, and, what, kind, of, destruction, had, occurred, it, seems, that, the, results, were, not, properly, analysed, during, the, 18th, century, in, part, due, to, the, death, of, the, person, in, charge, but, the, answers, have, allowed, modern, portuguese, scientists, to, reconstruct, the, event, with, greater, precision, because, the, marquis, was, the, first, to, attempt, an, objective, scientific, description, of, the, broad, causes, and, consequences, of, an, earthquake, he, is, regarded, as, a, forerunner, of, modern, seismological, scientists, in, 1761, spain, concluded, an, alliance, with, france, by, which, spain, would, enter, the, seven, years, war, in, an, effort, to, prevent, british, hegemony, the, two, countries, saw, portugal, as, britain, s, closest, ally, due, to, the, treaty, of, windsor, as, part, of, a, wider, plan, to, isolate, and, defeat, britain, spanish, and, french, envoys, were, sent, to, lisbon, to, demand, that, the, king, and, pombal, agree, to, cease, all, trade, or, co, operation, with, britain, or, face, war, while, pombal, was, keen, to, make, portugal, less, dependent, on, britain, this, was, a, long, term, goal, and, he, and, the, king, rejected, the, bourbon, ultimatum, on, 5, may, 1762, spain, sent, troops, across, the, border, and, penetrated, into, tr, s, os, montes, to, capture, porto, but, they, were, repelled, by, the, guerrillas, and, forced, to, abandon, all, their, conquests, but, chaves, after, suffering, huge, losses, 10, 000, casualties, thereby, the, spanish, general, nicol, s, de, carvajal, marquis, of, sarri, soon, lost, the, spanish, king, s, confidence, and, was, replaced, by, count, of, aranda, in, a, second, invasion, province, of, lower, beira, july, 1762, a, combined, franco, spanish, army, was, initially, successful, in, capturing, almeida, and, several, almost, undefended, fortresses, but, they, were, soon, ground, to, a, halt, by, a, small, anglo, portuguese, force, entrenched, in, the, hills, east, of, abrantes, pombal, had, sent, urgent, messages, to, london, requesting, military, assistance, consequently, 7, 104, british, troops, were, sent, together, with, william, count, of, schaumburg, lippe, and, military, staff, to, organise, the, portuguese, army, victory, in, the, battles, of, valencia, de, alc, ntara, and, vila, velha, and, above, all, a, scorched, earth, tactic, coupled, with, guerrilla, actions, in, the, spanish, logistic, lines, induced, starvation, and, eventually, the, disintegration, of, the, franco, spanish, army, 15, 000, casualties, many, of, them, inflicted, by, the, peasants, whose, remnants, were, driven, back, and, pursued, to, spain, the, spanish, headquarters, in, castelo, branco, was, taken, by, a, portuguese, force, under, townshend, and, all, the, strongholds, that, had, previously, been, occupied, by, the, bourbon, invaders, were, retaken, with, the, exception, of, almeida, a, third, spanish, offensive, in, the, alentejo, november, 1762, also, met, defeat, in, ouguela, marv, o, and, codiceira, the, invaders, were, chased, again, back, into, spain, and, saw, several, men, captured, by, the, advancing, allies, according, to, a, report, sent, to, the, british, government, by, british, ambassador, in, portugal, edward, hay, the, bourbon, armies, had, suffered, 30, 000, casualties, during, their, invasion, of, portugal, in, the, treaty, of, paris, spain, had, to, restore, to, portugal, chaves, and, almeida, plus, all, the, territory, taken, from, portugal, in, south, america, in, 1763, most, of, rio, grande, do, sul, and, colonia, do, sacramento, only, the, second, was, given, back, while, the, vast, territory, of, rio, grande, do, sul, together, with, present, day, roraima, would, be, reconquered, from, spain, in, the, undeclared, hispano, portuguese, war, of, 1763, 1777, however, portugal, also, conquered, spanish, territory, in, south, america, during, the, seven, years, war, most, of, the, rio, negro, valley, 1763, and, defeated, a, spanish, invasion, aiming, to, occupy, the, right, bank, of, the, guapor, river, in, mato, grosso, 1763, and, also, in, the, battle, of, santa, b, rbara, rio, grande, do, sul, 1, january, 1763, portugal, was, able, to, keep, all, these, territorial, gains, in, the, years, after, the, invasion, and, despite, the, crucial, british, assistance, pombal, began, to, be, increasingly, concerned, at, the, rise, of, british, power, despite, being, an, anglophile, he, suspected, the, british, were, interested, in, acquiring, brazil, and, he, was, alarmed, by, the, seeming, ease, by, which, they, had, taken, havana, and, manila, from, spain, in, 1762, as, noted, by, historian, andreas, leutzsch, during, pombal, s, reign, portugal, faced, foreign, threats, such, as, the, spanish, invasion, during, the, seven, years, war, in, 1762, even, if, portugal, was, able, to, defeat, the, spanish, with, the, help, of, their, british, allies, this, war, of, spain, and, france, against, british, hegemony, made, him, concerned, about, portuguese, independence, and, portugal, s, colonies, having, lived, outside, of, portugal, in, vienna, and, london, the, latter, city, in, particular, being, a, major, centre, of, the, enlightenment, pombal, increasingly, believed, that, the, society, of, jesus, also, known, as, the, jesuits, had, a, grip, on, science, and, education, and, that, they, were, an, inherent, drag, on, an, independent, portuguese, style, iluminismo, he, was, especially, familiar, with, the, anti, jesuit, tradition, of, britain, and, in, vienna, he, had, made, friends, with, gerhard, van, swieten, a, confidant, of, maria, theresa, of, austria, and, a, staunch, adversary, of, the, austrian, jesuits, influence, as, prime, minister, pombal, engaged, the, jesuits, in, a, propaganda, war, which, was, watched, closely, by, the, rest, of, europe, and, he, launched, a, number, of, conspiracy, theories, regarding, the, order, s, desire, for, power, during, the, t, vora, affair, see, below, he, accused, the, society, of, jesus, of, treason, and, attempted, regicide, a, major, public, relations, catastrophe, for, the, order, in, the, age, of, absolutism, historians, today, emphasise, the, society, s, role, in, trying, to, protect, native, americans, in, the, portuguese, and, spanish, colonies, and, the, fact, that, the, limitations, placed, upon, the, order, resulted, in, the, so, called, guarani, war, in, which, the, population, of, the, guarani, people, was, halved, by, spanish, and, portuguese, troops, according, to, a, census, conducted, in, 1756, the, population, of, the, guarani, from, the, seven, missions, was, 14, 284, which, was, about, 15, 000, less, than, the, population, in, 1750, the, former, jesuit, missions, were, occupied, by, the, portuguese, until, 1759, pombal, named, his, brother, d, paulo, ant, nio, de, carvalho, e, mendon, a, chief, inquisitor, and, used, the, inquisition, against, the, jesuits, pombal, was, thus, an, important, precursor, for, the, suppression, of, the, jesuits, throughout, europe, and, its, colonies, which, culminated, in, 1773, when, european, absolutists, forced, pope, clement, xiv, to, issue, a, bull, empowering, them, to, suppress, the, order, in, their, domains, following, the, earthquake, joseph, i, gave, his, prime, minister, even, more, authority, as, his, power, grew, his, enemies, increased, in, number, and, bitter, disputes, with, the, high, nobility, became, frequent, on, september, 3, 1758, joseph, i, was, wounded, in, an, attempted, assassination, when, he, was, returning, from, a, visit, to, his, mistress, the, young, married, marchioness, teresa, de, t, vora, on, december, 9, 1758, pombal, formed, a, special, investigatory, tribunal, its, members, were, himself, and, the, other, secretaries, of, state, approximately, sixty, individuals, were, convicted, by, the, tribunal, on, january, 12, 1759, several, nobles, including, members, of, the, t, vora, family, and, the, duke, of, aveiro, who, was, generally, regarded, as, the, head, of, the, conspiracy, were, sentenced, to, death, while, other, nobles, were, sentenced, to, indefinite, imprisonment, death, sentences, were, executed, by, breaking, wheel, burning, alive, strangling, and, beheading, the, brutality, of, the, executions, stirred, controversy, in, europe, at, the, time, in, december, 1760, the, marquis, who, himself, was, a, familiar, do, santo, oficio, a, lay, officer, of, the, inquisition, denounced, father, gabriel, malagrida, a, jesuit, to, the, inquisition, on, charges, of, heresy, he, was, sentenced, to, death, on, 21, september, 1761, malagrida, was, strangled, at, the, garrote, in, rossio, square, then, burned, on, a, bonfire, and, the, ashes, were, thrown, into, the, tagus, river, after, the, execution, of, the, t, voras, the, persecution, of, the, nobility, never, stopped, when, pombal, left, power, around, eight, hundred, political, prisoners, were, released, but, in, the, meantime, around, two, thousand, and, four, hundred, had, died, in, prison, after, pombal, had, been, removed, from, power, by, maria, i, an, inquiry, in, the, tavora, trial, endorsed, the, guilty, verdict, of, the, duke, of, aveiro, but, exonerated, the, tavora, family, there, were, long, standing, tensions, between, the, portuguese, crown, and, the, jesuits, so, that, the, t, vora, affair, could, be, considered, a, pretext, for, the, climax, to, the, conflict, that, resulted, in, the, jesuits, expulsion, from, portugal, and, its, empire, in, 1759, jesuit, assets, were, confiscated, by, the, crown, according, to, historians, james, lockhart, and, stuart, schwartz, the, jesuits, independence, power, wealth, control, of, education, and, ties, to, rome, made, the, jesuits, obvious, targets, for, pombal, s, brand, of, extreme, regalism, pombal, showed, no, mercy, prosecuting, every, person, involved, even, women, and, children, this, was, the, final, stroke, that, broke, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, and, ensured, the, prime, minister, s, victory, against, his, enemies, in, reward, for, his, swift, resolve, joseph, i, made, his, loyal, minister, count, of, oeiras, in, 1759, following, the, t, vora, affair, the, new, count, of, oeiras, knew, no, opposition, having, become, the, marquis, of, pombal, in, 1770, he, effectively, ruled, portugal, until, joseph, i, s, death, in, 1777, in, 1771, botanist, domenico, vandelli, published, pombalia, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, from, america, belonging, to, the, family, violaceae, and, named, in, honour, of, the, marquis, of, pombal, in, january, of, 1777, the, village, of, trafaria, was, deliberately, and, completely, burned, down, with, the, purpose, of, capturing, rebels, who, were, taking, refuge, there, with, many, people, dying,
