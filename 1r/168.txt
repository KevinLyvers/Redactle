corbusier, would, later, describe, these, as, my, guide, my, choice, and, as, time, honored, ideas, ingrained, and, deep, rooted, in, the, intellect, like, entries, from, a, catechism, like, his,

in, the, local, alpine, style, and, carefully, crafted, coloured, geometric, patterns, on, the, fa, ade, the, success, of, this, house, led, to, his, construction, of, two, similar, houses, the, villas, jacquemet, and, stotzer, in, the, same, area, in, september, 1907, he, made, his, first, trip, outside, of, switzerland, going, to, italy, then, that, winter, travelling, through, budapest,

galluzzo, which, made, a, lifelong, impression, on, him, i, would, have, liked, to, live, in, one, of, what, they, called, their, cells, he, wrote, later, it, was, the, solution, for, a, unique, kind, of, worker, s, housing, or, rather, for, a, terrestrial, paradise, he, travelled, to, paris, and, for, fourteen, months, between, 1908, and, 1910, he, worked, as, a, draftsman, in, the, office, of, the, architect, auguste, perret, the, pioneer, of, the, use, of, reinforced, concrete, in, residential, construction, and, the, architect, of, the, art, deco, landmark, th, tre, des, champs, lys, es,

bulgaria, turkey, greece, as, well, as, pompeii, and, rome, filling, nearly, 80, sketchbooks, with, renderings, of, what, he, saw, including, many, sketches, of, the, parthenon, whose, forms, he, would, later, praise, in, his, work, vers, une, architecture, 1923, he, spoke, of, what, he, saw, during, this, trip, in, many, of, his, books, and, it, was, the, subject, of, his, last, book, le, voyage, d, orient, in, 1912, he, began, his, most, ambitious, project, a, new, house, for, his, parents, also, located, on, the, forested, hillside, near, la, chaux, de, fonds, the, jeanneret, perret, house, was, larger, than, the, others, and, in, a, more, innovative, style, the, horizontal, planes, contrasted, dramatically, with, the, steep, alpine, slopes, and, the, white, walls, and, lack, of, decoration, were, in, sharp, contrast, with, the, other, buildings, on, the, hillside, the, interior, spaces, were, organized, around, the, four, pillars, of, the, salon, in, the, centre, foretelling, the, open, interiors, he, would, create, in, his, later, buildings, the, project, was, more, expensive, to, build, than, he, imagined, his, parents, were, forced, to, move, from, the, house, within, ten, years, and, relocate, to, a, more, modest, house, however, it, led, to, a, commission, to, build, an, even, more, imposing, villa, in, the, nearby, village, of, le, locle, for, a, wealthy, watch, manufacturer, georges, favre, jacot, le, corbusier, designed, the, new, house, in, less, than, a, month, the, building, was, carefully, designed, to, fit, its, hillside, site, and, the, interior, plan, was, spacious, and, designed, around, a, courtyard, for, maximum, light, a, significant, departure, from, the, traditional, house, during, world, war, i, le, corbusier, taught, at, his, old, school, in, la, chaux, de, fonds, he, concentrated, on, theoretical, architectural, studies, using, modern, techniques, in, december, 1914, along, with, the, engineer, max, dubois, he, began, a, serious, study, of, the, use, of, reinforced, concrete, as, a, building, material, he, had, first, discovered, concrete, working, in, the, office, of, auguste, perret, the, pioneer, of, reinforced, concrete, architecture, in, paris, but, now, wanted, to, use, it, in, new, ways, reinforced, concrete, provided, me, with, incredible, resources, he, wrote, later, and, variety, and, a, passionate, plasticity, in, which, by, themselves, my, structures, will, be, the, rhythm, of, a, palace, and, a, pompieen, tranquillity, this, led, him, to, his, plan, for, the, dom, ino, house, 1914, 15, this, model, proposed, an, open, floor, plan, consisting, of, three, concrete, slabs, supported, by, six, thin, reinforced, concrete, columns, with, a, stairway, providing, access, to, each, level, on, one, side, of, the, floor, plan, the, system, was, originally, designed, to, provide, large, numbers, of, temporary, residences, after, world, war, i, producing, only, slabs, columns, and, stairways, and, residents, could, build, exterior, walls, with, the, materials, around, the, site, he, described, it, in, his, patent, application, as, a, juxtiposable, system, of, construction, according, to, an, infinite, number, of, combinations, of, plans, this, would, permit, he, wrote, the, construction, of, the, dividing, walls, at, any, point, on, the, fa, ade, or, the, interior, under, this, system, the, structure, of, the, house, did, not, have, to, appear, on, the, outside, but, could, be, hidden, behind, a, glass, wall, and, the, interior, could, be, arranged, in, any, way, the, architect, liked, after, it, was, patented, le, corbusier, designed, several, houses, according, to, the, system, which, was, all, white, concrete, boxes, although, some, of, these, were, never, built, they, illustrated, his, basic, architectural, ideas, which, would, dominate, his, works, throughout, the, 1920s, he, refined, the, idea, in, his, 1927, book, on, the, five, points, of, a, new, architecture, this, design, which, called, for, the, disassociation, of, the, structure, from, the, walls, and, the, freedom, of, plans, and, fa, ades, became, the, foundation, for, most, of, his, architecture, over, the, next, ten, years, in, august, 1916, le, corbusier, received, his, largest, commission, ever, to, construct, a, villa, for, the, swiss, watchmaker, anatole, schwob, for, whom, he, had, already, completed, several, small, remodelling, projects, he, was, given, a, large, budget, and, the, freedom, to, design, not, only, the, house, but, also, to, create, the, interior, decoration, and, choose, the, furniture, following, the, precepts, of, auguste, perret, he, built, the, structure, out, of, reinforced, concrete, and, filled, the, gaps, with, brick, the, centre, of, the, house, is, a, large, concrete, box, with, two, semicolumn, structures, on, both, sides, which, reflects, his, ideas, of, pure, geometrical, forms, a, large, open, hall, with, a, chandelier, occupied, the, centre, of, the, building, you, can, see, he, wrote, to, auguste, perret, in, july, 1916, that, auguste, perret, left, more, in, me, than, peter, behrens, le, corbusier, s, grand, ambitions, collided, with, the, ideas, and, budget, of, his, client, and, led, to, bitter, conflicts, schwob, went, to, court, and, denied, le, corbusier, access, to, the, site, or, the, right, to, claim, to, be, the, architect, le, corbusier, responded, whether, you, like, it, or, not, my, presence, is, inscribed, in, every, corner, of, your, house, le, corbusier, took, great, pride, in, the, house, and, reproduced, pictures, in, several, of, his, books, le, corbusier, moved, to, paris, definitively, in, 1917, and, began, his, architectural, practise, with, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, 1896, 1967, a, partnership, that, would, last, until, the, 1950s, with, an, interruption, in, the, world, war, ii, years, in, 1918, le, corbusier, met, the, cubist, painter, am, d, e, ozenfant, in, whom, he, recognised, a, kindred, spirit, ozenfant, encouraged, him, to, paint, and, the, two, began, a, period, of, collaboration, rejecting, cubism, as, irrational, and, romantic, the, pair, jointly, published, their, manifesto, apr, s, le, cubisme, and, established, a, new, artistic, movement, purism, ozenfant, and, le, corbusier, began, writing, for, a, new, journal, l, esprit, nouveau, and, promoted, with, energy, and, imagination, his, ideas, of, architecture, in, the, first, issue, of, the, journal, in, 1920, charles, edouard, jeanneret, adopted, le, corbusier, an, altered, form, of, his, maternal, grandfather, s, name, lecorb, sier, as, a, pseudonym, reflecting, his, belief, that, anyone, could, reinvent, themselves, adopting, a, single, name, to, identify, oneself, was, in, vogue, by, artists, in, many, fields, during, that, era, especially, in, paris, between, 1918, and, 1922, le, corbusier, did, not, build, anything, concentrating, his, efforts, on, purist, theory, and, painting, in, 1922, he, and, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, opened, a, studio, in, paris, at, 35, rue, de, s, vres, they, set, up, an, architectural, practice, together, from, 1927, to, 1937, they, worked, together, with, charlotte, perriand, at, the, le, corbusier, pierre, jeanneret, studio, in, 1929, the, trio, prepared, the, house, fittings, section, for, the, decorative, artists, exhibition, and, asked, for, a, group, stand, renewing, and, widening, the, 1928, avant, garde, group, idea, this, was, refused, by, the, decorative, artists, committee, they, resigned, and, founded, the, union, of, modern, artists, union, des, artistes, modernes, uam, his, theoretical, studies, soon, advanced, into, several, different, single, family, house, models, among, these, was, the, maison, citrohan, the, project, s, name, was, a, reference, to, the, french, citro, n, automaker, for, the, modern, industrial, methods, and, materials, le, corbusier, advocated, using, in, the, house, s, construction, as, well, as, how, he, intended, the, homes, would, be, consumed, similar, to, other, commercial, products, like, the, automobile, as, part, of, the, maison, citrohan, model, le, corbusier, proposed, a, three, floor, structure, with, a, double, height, living, room, bedrooms, on, the, second, floor, and, a, kitchen, on, the, third, floor, the, roof, would, be, occupied, by, a, sun, terrace, on, the, exterior, le, corbusier, installed, a, stairway, to, provide, second, floor, access, from, the, ground, level, here, as, in, other, projects, from, this, period, he, also, designed, the, fa, ades, to, include, large, uninterrupted, banks, of, windows, the, house, used, a, rectangular, plan, with, exterior, walls, that, were, not, filled, by, windows, but, left, as, white, stuccoed, spaces, le, corbusier, and, jeanneret, left, the, interior, aesthetically, spare, with, any, movable, furniture, made, of, tubular, metal, frames, light, fixtures, usually, comprised, single, bare, bulbs, interior, walls, also, were, left, white, in, 1922, and, 1923, le, corbusier, devoted, himself, to, advocating, his, new, concepts, of, architecture, and, urban, planning, in, a, series, of, polemical, articles, published, in, l, esprit, nouveau, at, the, paris, salon, d, automne, in, 1922, he, presented, his, plan, for, the, ville, contemporaine, a, model, city, for, three, million, people, whose, residents, would, live, and, work, in, a, group, of, identical, sixty, story, tall, apartment, buildings, surrounded, by, lower, zig, zag, apartment, blocks, and, a, large, park, in, 1923, he, collected, his, essays, from, l, esprit, nouveau, published, his, first, and, most, influential, book, towards, an, architecture, he, presented, his, ideas, for, the, future, of, architecture, in, a, series, of, maxims, declarations, and, exhortations, pronouncing, that, a, grand, epoch, has, just, begun, there, exists, a, new, spirit, there, already, exist, a, crowd, of, works, in, the, new, spirit, they, are, found, especially, in, industrial, production, architecture, is, suffocating, in, its, current, uses, styles, are, a, lie, style, is, a, unity, of, principles, which, animates, all, the, work, of, a, period, and, which, result, in, a, characteristic, spirit, our, epoch, determines, each, day, its, style, our, eyes, unfortunately, don, t, know, how, to, see, it, yet, and, his, most, famous, maxim, a, house, is, a, machine, to, live, in, most, of, the, many, photographs, and, drawings, in, the, book, came, from, outside, the, world, of, traditional, architecture, the, cover, showed, the, promenade, deck, of, an, ocean, liner, while, others, showed, racing, cars, aeroplanes, factories, and, the, huge, concrete, and, steel, arches, of, zeppelin, hangars, an, important, early, work, of, le, corbusier, was, the, esprit, nouveau, pavilion, built, for, the, 1925, paris, international, exhibition, of, modern, decorative, and, industrial, arts, the, event, which, later, gave, art, deco, its, name, le, corbusier, built, the, pavilion, in, collaboration, with, am, d, e, ozenfant, and, with, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, le, corbusier, and, ozenfant, had, broken, with, cubism, and, formed, the, purism, movement, in, 1918, and, in, 1920, founded, their, journal, l, esprit, nouveau, in, his, new, journal, le, corbusier, vividly, denounced, the, decorative, arts, decorative, art, as, opposed, to, the, machine, phenomenon, is, the, final, twitch, of, the, old, manual, modes, a, dying, thing, to, illustrate, his, ideas, he, and, ozenfant, decided, to, create, a, small, pavilion, at, the, exposition, representing, his, idea, of, the, future, urban, housing, unit, a, house, he, wrote, is, a, cell, within, the, body, of, a, city, the, cell, is, made, up, of, the, vital, elements, which, are, the, mechanics, of, a, house, decorative, art, is, antistandardizational, our, pavilion, will, contain, only, standard, things, created, by, industry, in, factories, and, mass, produced, objects, truly, of, the, style, of, today, my, pavilion, will, therefore, be, a, cell, extracted, from, a, huge, apartment, building, le, corbusier, and, his, collaborators, were, given, a, plot, of, land, located, behind, the, grand, palais, in, the, centre, of, the, exposition, the, plot, was, forested, and, exhibitors, could, not, cut, down, trees, so, le, corbusier, built, his, pavilion, with, a, tree, in, the, centre, emerging, through, a, hole, in, the, roof, the, building, was, a, stark, white, box, with, an, interior, terrace, and, square, glass, windows, the, interior, was, decorated, with, a, few, cubist, paintings, and, a, few, pieces, of, mass, produced, commercially, available, furniture, entirely, different, from, the, expensive, one, of, a, kind, pieces, in, the, other, pavilions, the, chief, organizers, of, the, exposition, were, furious, and, built, a, fence, to, partially, hide, the, pavilion, le, corbusier, had, to, appeal, to, the, ministry, of, fine, arts, which, ordered, that, fence, be, taken, down, besides, the, furniture, the, pavilion, exhibited, a, model, of, his, plan, voisin, his, provocative, plan, for, rebuilding, a, large, part, of, the, centre, of, paris, he, proposed, to, bulldoze, a, large, area, north, of, the, seine, and, replace, the, narrow, streets, monuments, and, houses, with, giant, sixty, story, cruciform, towers, placed, within, an, orthogonal, street, grid, and, park, like, green, space, his, scheme, was, met, with, criticism, and, scorn, from, french, politicians, and, industrialists, although, they, were, favourable, to, the, ideas, of, taylorism, and, fordism, underlying, his, designs, the, plan, was, never, seriously, considered, but, it, provoked, discussion, concerning, how, to, deal, with, the, overcrowded, poor, working, class, neighbourhoods, of, paris, and, it, later, saw, the, partial, realization, in, the, housing, developments, built, in, the, paris, suburbs, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, pavilion, was, ridiculed, by, many, critics, but, le, corbusier, undaunted, wrote, right, now, one, thing, is, sure, 1925, marks, the, decisive, turning, point, in, the, quarrel, between, the, old, and, new, after, 1925, the, antique, lovers, will, have, virtually, ended, their, lives, progress, is, achieved, through, experimentation, the, decision, will, be, awarded, on, the, field, of, battle, of, the, new, in, 1925, le, corbusier, combined, a, series, of, articles, about, decorative, art, from, l, esprit, nouveau, into, a, book, l, art, d, coratif, d, aujourd, hui, the, decorative, art, of, today, the, book, was, a, spirited, attack, on, the, very, idea, of, decorative, art, his, basic, premise, repeated, throughout, the, book, was, modern, decorative, art, has, no, decoration, he, attacked, with, enthusiasm, the, styles, presented, at, the, 1925, exposition, of, decorative, arts, the, desire, to, decorate, everything, about, one, is, a, false, spirit, and, an, abominable, small, perversion, the, religion, of, beautiful, materials, is, in, its, final, death, agony, the, almost, hysterical, onrush, in, recent, years, toward, this, quasi, orgy, of, decor, is, only, the, last, spasm, of, a, death, already, predictable, he, cited, the, 1912, book, of, the, austrian, architect, adolf, loos, ornament, and, crime, and, quoted, loos, s, dictum, the, more, a, people, are, cultivated, the, more, decor, disappears, he, attacked, the, deco, revival, of, classical, styles, what, he, called, louis, philippe, and, louis, xvi, moderne, he, condemned, the, symphony, of, color, at, the, exposition, and, called, it, the, triumph, of, assemblers, of, colors, and, materials, they, were, swaggering, in, colors, they, were, making, stews, out, of, fine, cuisine, he, condemned, the, exotic, styles, presented, at, the, exposition, based, on, the, art, of, china, japan, india, and, persia, it, takes, energy, today, to, affirm, our, western, styles, he, criticized, the, precious, and, useless, objects, that, accumulated, on, the, shelves, in, the, new, style, he, attacked, the, rustling, silks, the, marbles, which, twist, and, turn, the, vermilion, whiplashes, the, silver, blades, of, byzantium, and, the, orient, let, s, be, done, with, it, why, call, bottles, chairs, baskets, and, objects, decorative, le, corbusier, asked, they, are, useful, tools, the, decor, is, not, necessary, art, is, necessary, he, declared, that, in, the, future, the, decorative, arts, industry, would, produce, only, objects, which, are, perfectly, useful, convenient, and, have, a, true, luxury, which, pleases, our, spirit, by, their, elegance, and, the, purity, of, their, execution, and, the, efficiency, of, their, services, this, rational, perfection, and, precise, determinate, creates, the, link, sufficient, to, recognize, a, style, he, described, the, future, of, decoration, in, these, terms, the, idea, is, to, go, work, in, the, superb, office, of, a, modern, factory, rectangular, and, well, lit, painted, in, white, ripolin, a, major, french, paint, manufacturer, where, healthy, activity, and, laborious, optimism, reign, he, concluded, by, repeating, modern, decoration, has, no, decoration, the, book, became, a, manifesto, for, those, who, opposed, the, more, traditional, styles, of, the, decorative, arts, in, the, 1930s, as, le, corbusier, predicted, the, modernized, versions, of, louis, philippe, and, louis, xvi, furniture, and, the, brightly, coloured, wallpapers, of, stylized, roses, were, replaced, by, a, more, sober, more, streamlined, style, gradually, the, modernism, and, functionality, proposed, by, le, corbusier, overtook, the, more, ornamental, style, the, shorthand, titles, that, le, corbusier, used, in, the, book, 1925, expo, arts, deco, were, adapted, in, 1966, by, the, art, historian, bevis, hillier, for, a, catalogue, of, an, exhibition, on, the, style, and, in, 1968, in, the, title, of, a, book, art, deco, of, the, 20s, and, 30s, and, thereafter, the, term, art, deco, was, commonly, used, as, the, name, of, the, style, the, notoriety, that, le, corbusier, achieved, from, his, writings, and, the, pavilion, at, the, 1925, exposition, led, to, commissions, to, build, a, dozen, residences, in, paris, and, the, paris, region, in, his, purist, style, these, included, the, maison, la, roche, albert, jeanneret, 1923, 1925, which, now, houses, the, fondation, le, corbusier, the, maison, guiette, in, antwerp, belgium, 1926, a, residence, for, jacques, lipchitz, the, maison, cook, and, the, maison, planeix, in, 1927, he, was, invited, by, the, german, werkbund, to, build, three, houses, in, the, model, city, of, weissenhof, near, stuttgart, based, on, the, citroen, house, and, other, theoretical, models, he, had, published, he, described, this, project, in, detail, in, one, of, his, best, known, essays, the, five, points, of, architecture, the, following, year, he, began, the, villa, savoye, 1928, 1931, which, became, one, of, the, most, famous, of, le, corbusier, s, works, and, an, icon, of, modernist, architecture, located, in, poissy, in, a, landscape, surrounded, by, trees, and, a, large, lawn, the, house, is, an, elegant, white, box, poised, on, rows, of, slender, pylons, surrounded, by, a, horizontal, band, of, windows, which, fill, the, structure, with, light, the, service, areas, parking, rooms, for, servants, and, laundry, room, are, located, under, the, house, visitors, enter, a, vestibule, from, which, a, gentle, ramp, leads, to, the, house, itself, the, bedrooms, and, salons, of, the, house, are, distributed, around, a, suspended, garden, the, rooms, look, both, out, at, the, landscape, and, into, the, garden, which, provides, additional, light, and, air, another, ramp, leads, up, to, the, roof, and, a, stairway, leads, down, to, the, cellar, under, the, pillars, villa, savoye, succinctly, summed, up, the, five, points, of, architecture, that, he, had, elucidated, in, l, esprit, nouveau, and, the, book, vers, une, architecture, which, he, had, been, developing, throughout, the, 1920s, first, le, corbusier, lifted, the, bulk, of, the, structure, off, the, ground, supporting, it, by, pilotis, reinforced, concrete, stilts, these, pilotis, in, providing, the, structural, support, for, the, house, allowed, him, to, elucidate, his, next, two, points, a, free, fa, ade, meaning, non, supporting, walls, that, could, be, designed, as, the, architect, wished, and, an, open, floor, plan, meaning, that, the, floor, space, was, free, to, be, configured, into, rooms, without, concern, for, supporting, walls, the, second, floor, of, the, villa, savoye, includes, long, strips, of, ribbon, windows, that, allow, unencumbered, views, of, the, large, surrounding, garden, which, constitute, the, fourth, point, of, his, system, the, fifth, point, was, the, roof, garden, to, compensate, for, the, green, area, consumed, by, the, building, and, replace, it, on, the, roof, a, ramp, rising, from, ground, level, to, the, third, floor, roof, terrace, allows, for, a, promenade, architecturale, through, the, structure, the, white, tubular, railing, recalls, the, industrial, ocean, liner, aesthetic, that, le, corbusier, much, admired, le, corbusier, was, quite, rhapsodic, when, describing, the, house, in, pr, cisions, in, 1930, the, plan, is, pure, exactly, made, for, the, needs, of, the, house, it, has, its, correct, place, in, the, rustic, landscape, of, poissy, it, is, poetry, and, lyricism, supported, by, technique, the, house, had, its, problems, the, roof, persistently, leaked, due, to, construction, faults, but, it, became, a, landmark, of, modern, architecture, and, one, of, the, best, known, works, of, le, corbusier, thanks, to, his, passionate, articles, in, l, esprit, nouveau, his, participation, in, the, 1925, decorative, arts, exposition, and, the, conferences, he, gave, on, the, new, spirit, of, architecture, le, corbusier, had, become, well, known, in, the, architectural, world, though, he, had, only, built, residences, for, wealthy, clients, in, 1926, he, entered, the, competition, for, the, construction, of, a, headquarters, for, the, league, of, nations, in, geneva, with, a, plan, for, an, innovative, lakeside, complex, of, modernist, white, concrete, office, buildings, and, meeting, halls, there, were, 337, projects, in, competition, it, appeared, that, the, corbusier, s, project, was, the, first, choice, of, the, architectural, jury, but, after, much, behind, the, scenes, manoeuvring, the, jury, declared, it, was, unable, to, pick, a, single, winner, and, the, project, was, given, instead, to, the, top, five, architects, who, were, all, neoclassicists, le, corbusier, was, not, discouraged, he, presented, his, plans, to, the, public, in, articles, and, lectures, to, show, the, opportunity, that, the, league, of, nations, had, missed, in, 1926, le, corbusier, received, the, opportunity, he, had, been, looking, for, he, was, commissioned, by, a, bordeaux, industrialist, henry, frug, s, a, fervent, admirer, of, his, ideas, on, urban, planning, to, build, a, complex, of, worker, housing, the, cit, frug, s, at, pessac, a, suburb, of, bordeaux, le, corbusier, described, pessac, as, a, little, like, a, balzac, novel, a, chance, to, create, a, whole, community, for, living, and, working, the, fruges, quarter, became, his, first, laboratory, for, residential, housing, a, series, of, rectangular, blocks, composed, of, modular, housing, units, located, in, a, garden, setting, like, the, unit, displayed, at, the, 1925, exposition, each, housing, unit, had, its, own, small, terrace, the, earlier, villas, he, constructed, all, had, white, exterior, walls, but, for, pessac, at, the, request, of, his, clients, he, added, colour, panels, of, brown, yellow, and, jade, green, coordinated, by, le, corbusier, originally, planned, to, have, some, two, hundred, units, it, finally, contained, about, fifty, to, seventy, housing, units, in, eight, buildings, pessac, became, the, model, on, a, small, scale, for, his, later, and, much, larger, cit, radieuse, projects, in, 1928, le, corbusier, took, a, major, step, toward, establishing, modernist, architecture, as, the, dominant, european, style, le, corbusier, had, met, with, many, of, the, leading, german, and, austrian, modernists, during, the, competition, for, the, league, of, nations, in, 1927, in, the, same, year, the, german, werkbund, organized, an, architectural, exposition, at, the, weissenhof, estate, stuttgart, seventeen, leading, modernist, architects, in, europe, were, invited, to, design, twenty, one, houses, le, corbusier, and, mies, van, der, rohe, played, a, major, part, in, 1927, le, corbusier, pierre, chareau, and, others, proposed, the, foundation, of, an, international, conference, to, establish, the, basis, for, a, common, style, the, first, meeting, of, the, congr, s, internationaux, d, architecture, moderne, or, international, congresses, of, modern, architects, ciam, was, held, in, a, ch, teau, on, lake, leman, in, switzerland, 26, 28, june, 1928, those, attending, included, le, corbusier, robert, mallet, stevens, auguste, perret, pierre, chareau, and, tony, garnier, from, france, victor, bourgeois, from, belgium, walter, gropius, erich, mendelsohn, ernst, may, and, mies, van, der, rohe, from, germany, josef, frank, from, austria, mart, stam, and, gerrit, rietveld, from, the, netherlands, and, adolf, loos, from, czechoslovakia, a, delegation, of, soviet, architects, was, invited, to, attend, but, they, were, unable, to, obtain, visas, later, members, included, josep, llu, s, sert, of, spain, and, alvar, aalto, of, finland, no, one, attended, from, the, united, states, a, second, meeting, was, organized, in, 1930, in, brussels, by, victor, bourgeois, on, the, topic, rational, methods, for, groups, of, habitations, a, third, meeting, on, the, functional, city, was, scheduled, for, moscow, in, 1932, but, was, cancelled, at, the, last, minute, instead, the, delegates, held, their, meeting, on, a, cruise, ship, travelling, between, marseille, and, athens, on, board, they, together, drafted, a, text, on, how, modern, cities, should, be, organized, the, text, called, the, athens, charter, after, considerable, editing, by, le, corbusier, and, others, was, finally, published, in, 1943, and, became, an, influential, text, for, city, planners, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, group, met, once, more, in, paris, in, 1937, to, discuss, public, housing, and, was, scheduled, to, meet, in, the, united, states, in, 1939, but, the, meeting, was, cancelled, because, of, the, war, the, legacy, of, the, ciam, was, a, roughly, common, style, and, doctrine, which, helped, define, modern, architecture, in, europe, and, the, united, states, after, world, war, ii, le, corbusier, saw, the, new, society, founded, in, the, soviet, union, after, the, russian, revolution, as, a, promising, laboratory, for, his, architectural, ideas, he, met, the, russian, architect, konstantin, melnikov, during, the, 1925, decorative, arts, exposition, in, paris, and, admired, the, construction, of, melnikov, s, constructivist, ussr, pavilion, the, only, truly, modernist, building, in, the, exposition, other, than, his, own, esprit, nouveau, pavilion, at, melnikov, s, invitation, he, travelled, to, moscow, where, he, found, that, his, writings, had, been, published, in, russian, he, gave, lectures, and, interviews, and, between, 1928, and, 1932, he, constructed, an, office, building, for, the, tsentrosoyuz, the, headquarters, of, soviet, trade, unions, in, 1932, he, was, invited, to, take, part, in, an, international, competition, for, the, new, palace, of, the, soviets, in, moscow, which, was, to, be, built, on, the, site, of, the, cathedral, of, christ, the, saviour, demolished, on, stalin, s, orders, le, corbusier, contributed, a, highly, original, plan, a, low, level, complex, of, circular, and, rectangular, buildings, and, a, rainbow, like, arch, from, which, the, roof, of, the, main, meeting, hall, was, suspended, to, le, corbusier, s, distress, his, plan, was, rejected, by, stalin, in, favour, of, a, plan, for, a, massive, neoclassical, tower, the, highest, in, europe, crowned, with, a, statue, of, vladimir, lenin, the, palace, was, never, built, construction, was, stopped, by, world, war, ii, a, swimming, pool, took, its, place, and, after, the, collapse, of, the, ussr, the, cathedral, was, rebuilt, on, its, original, site, between, 1928, and, 1934, as, le, corbusier, s, reputation, grew, he, received, commissions, to, construct, a, wide, variety, of, buildings, in, 1928, he, received, a, commission, from, the, soviet, government, to, construct, the, headquarters, of, the, tsentrosoyuz, or, central, office, of, trade, unions, a, large, office, building, whose, glass, walls, alternated, with, plaques, of, stone, he, built, the, villa, de, madrot, in, le, pradet, 1929, 1931, and, an, apartment, in, paris, for, charles, de, bestigui, at, the, top, of, an, existing, building, on, the, champs, lys, es, 1929, 1932, later, demolished, in, 1929, 1930, he, constructed, a, floating, homeless, shelter, for, the, salvation, army, on, the, left, bank, of, the, seine, at, the, pont, d, austerlitz, between, 1929, and, 1933, he, built, a, larger, and, more, ambitious, project, for, the, salvation, army, the, cit, de, refuge, on, rue, cantagrel, in, the, 13th, arrondissement, of, paris, he, also, constructed, the, swiss, pavilion, in, the, cit, universitaire, in, paris, with, 46, units, of, student, housing, 1929, 33, he, designed, furniture, to, go, with, the, building, the, main, salon, was, decorated, with, a, montage, of, black, and, white, photographs, of, nature, in, 1948, he, replaced, this, with, a, colourful, mural, he, painted, himself, in, geneva, he, built, a, glass, walled, apartment, building, with, 45, units, the, immeuble, clart, between, 1931, and, 1945, he, built, an, apartment, building, with, fifteen, units, including, an, apartment, and, studio, for, himself, on, the, 6th, and, 7th, floors, at, 24, rue, nungesser, et, coli, in, the, 16th, arrondissement, in, paris, overlooking, the, bois, de, boulogne, his, apartment, and, studio, are, owned, today, by, the, fondation, le, corbusier, and, can, be, visited, as, the, global, great, depression, enveloped, europe, le, corbusier, devoted, more, and, more, time, to, his, ideas, for, urban, design, and, planned, cities, he, believed, that, his, new, modern, architectural, forms, would, provide, an, organizational, solution, that, would, raise, the, quality, of, life, for, the, working, classes, in, 1922, he, had, presented, his, model, of, the, ville, contemporaine, a, city, of, three, million, inhabitants, at, the, salon, d, automne, in, paris, his, plan, featured, tall, office, towers, surrounded, by, lower, residential, blocks, in, a, park, setting, he, reported, that, analysis, leads, to, such, dimensions, to, such, a, new, scale, and, to, such, the, creation, of, an, urban, organism, so, different, from, those, that, exist, that, it, that, the, mind, can, hardly, imagine, it, the, ville, contemporaine, presenting, an, imaginary, city, in, an, imaginary, location, did, not, attract, the, attention, that, le, corbusier, wanted, for, his, next, proposal, the, plan, voisin, 1925, he, took, a, much, more, provocative, approach, he, proposed, to, demolish, a, large, part, of, central, paris, and, replace, it, with, a, group, of, sixty, story, cruciform, office, towers, surrounded, by, parkland, this, idea, shocked, most, viewers, as, it, was, certainly, intended, to, do, the, plan, included, a, multi, level, transportation, hub, that, included, depots, for, buses, and, trains, as, well, as, highway, intersections, and, an, airport, le, corbusier, had, the, fanciful, notion, that, commercial, airliners, would, land, between, the, huge, skyscrapers, he, segregated, pedestrian, circulation, paths, from, the, roadways, and, created, an, elaborate, road, network, groups, of, lower, rise, zigzag, apartment, blocks, set, back, from, the, street, were, interspersed, among, the, office, towers, le, corbusier, wrote, the, centre, of, paris, currently, threatened, with, death, threatened, by, exodus, is, in, reality, a, diamond, mine, to, abandon, the, centre, of, paris, to, its, fate, is, to, desert, in, face, of, the, enemy, as, no, doubt, le, corbusier, expected, no, one, hurried, to, implement, the, plan, voisin, but, he, continued, working, on, variations, of, the, idea, and, recruiting, followers, in, 1929, he, travelled, to, brazil, where, he, gave, conferences, on, his, architectural, ideas, he, returned, with, drawings, of, his, vision, for, rio, de, janeiro, he, sketched, serpentine, multi, story, apartment, buildings, on, pylons, like, inhabited, highways, winding, through, rio, de, janeiro, in, 1931, he, developed, a, visionary, plan, for, another, city, algiers, then, part, of, france, this, plan, like, his, rio, janeiro, plan, called, for, the, construction, of, an, elevated, viaduct, of, concrete, carrying, residential, units, which, would, run, from, one, end, of, the, city, to, the, other, this, plan, unlike, his, early, plan, voisin, was, more, conservative, because, it, did, not, call, for, the, destruction, of, the, old, city, of, algiers, the, residential, housing, would, be, over, the, top, of, the, old, city, this, plan, like, his, paris, plans, provoked, discussion, but, never, came, close, to, realization, in, 1935, le, corbusier, made, his, first, visit, to, the, united, states, he, was, asked, by, american, journalists, what, he, thought, about, new, york, city, skyscrapers, he, responded, characteristically, that, he, found, them, much, too, small, he, wrote, a, book, describing, his, experiences, in, the, states, quand, les, cath, drales, taient, blanches, voyage, au, pays, des, timides, when, cathedrals, were, white, voyage, to, the, land, of, the, timid, whose, title, expressed, his, view, of, the, lack, of, boldness, in, american, architecture, he, wrote, a, great, deal, but, built, very, little, in, the, late, 1930s, the, titles, of, his, books, expressed, the, combined, urgency, and, optimism, of, his, messages, cannons, munitions, no, thank, you, lodging, please, 1938, and, the, lyricism, of, modern, times, and, urbanism, 1939, in, 1928, the, french, minister, of, labour, louis, loucheur, won, the, passage, of, french, law, on, public, housing, calling, for, the, construction, of, 260, 000, new, housing, units, within, five, years, le, corbusier, immediately, began, to, design, a, new, type, of, modular, housing, unit, which, he, called, the, maison, loucheur, which, would, be, suitable, for, the, project, these, units, were, forty, five, square, metres, 480, square, feet, in, size, made, with, metal, frames, and, were, designed, to, be, mass, produced, and, then, transported, to, the, site, where, they, would, be, inserted, into, frameworks, of, steel, and, stone, the, government, insisted, on, stone, walls, to, win, the, support, of, local, building, contractors, the, standardisation, of, apartment, buildings, was, the, essence, of, what, le, corbusier, termed, the, ville, radieuse, or, radiant, city, in, a, new, book, published, in, 1935, the, radiant, city, was, similar, to, his, earlier, contemporary, city, and, plan, voisin, with, the, difference, that, residences, would, be, assigned, by, family, size, rather, than, by, income, and, social, position, in, his, 1935, book, he, developed, his, ideas, for, a, new, kind, of, city, where, the, principal, functions, heavy, industry, manufacturing, habitation, and, commerce, would, be, separated, into, their, neighbourhoods, carefully, planned, and, designed, however, before, any, units, could, be, built, world, war, ii, intervened, during, the, war, and, the, german, occupation, of, france, le, corbusier, did, his, best, to, promote, his, architectural, projects, he, moved, to, vichy, for, a, time, where, the, collaborationist, government, of, marshal, philippe, petain, was, located, offering, his, services, for, architectural, projects, including, his, plan, for, the, reconstruction, of, algiers, but, they, were, rejected, he, continued, writing, completing, sur, les, quatres, routes, on, the, four, routes, in, 1941, after, 1942, le, corbusier, left, vichy, for, paris, he, became, for, a, time, a, technical, adviser, at, alexis, carrel, s, eugenics, foundation, but, resigned, on, 20, april, 1944, in, 1943, he, founded, a, new, association, of, modern, architects, and, builders, the, ascoral, the, assembly, of, constructors, for, a, renewal, of, architecture, but, there, were, no, projects, to, build, when, the, war, ended, le, corbusier, was, nearly, sixty, years, old, and, he, had, not, had, a, single, project, realized, for, ten, years, he, tried, without, success, to, obtain, commissions, for, several, of, the, first, large, reconstruction, projects, but, his, proposals, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, town, of, saint, di, and, for, la, rochelle, were, rejected, still, he, persisted, and, finally, found, a, willing, partner, in, raoul, dautry, the, new, minister, of, reconstruction, and, town, planning, dautry, agreed, to, fund, one, of, his, projects, a, unit, habitation, de, grandeur, conforme, or, housing, units, of, standard, size, with, the, first, one, to, be, built, in, marseille, which, had, been, heavily, damaged, during, the, war, this, was, his, first, public, commission, and, was, a, breakthrough, for, le, corbusier, he, gave, the, building, the, name, of, his, pre, war, theoretical, project, the, cit, radieuse, and, followed, the, principles, that, he, had, studied, before, the, war, proposing, a, giant, reinforced, concrete, framework, into, which, modular, apartments, would, fit, like, bottles, into, a, bottle, rack, like, the, villa, savoye, the, structure, was, poised, on, concrete, pylons, though, because, of, the, shortage, of, steel, to, reinforce, the, concrete, the, pylons, were, more, massive, than, usual, the, building, contained, 337, duplex, apartment, modules, to, house, a, total, of, 1, 600, people, each, module, was, three, storeys, high, and, contained, two, apartments, combined, so, each, had, two, levels, see, diagram, above, the, modules, ran, from, one, side, of, the, building, to, the, other, and, each, apartment, had, a, small, terrace, at, each, end, they, were, ingeniously, fitted, together, like, pieces, of, a, chinese, puzzle, with, a, corridor, slotted, through, the, space, between, the, two, apartments, in, each, module, residents, had, a, choice, of, twenty, three, different, configurations, for, the, units, le, corbusier, designed, furniture, carpets, and, lamps, to, go, with, the, building, all, purely, functional, the, only, decoration, was, a, choice, of, interior, colours, the, only, mildly, decorative, features, of, the, building, were, the, ventilator, shafts, on, the, roof, which, le, corbusier, made, to, look, like, the, smokestacks, of, an, ocean, liner, a, functional, form, that, he, admired, the, building, was, designed, not, just, to, be, a, residence, but, to, offer, all, the, services, needed, for, living, on, every, third, floor, between, the, modules, there, was, a, wide, corridor, like, an, interior, street, which, ran, the, length, of, the, building, this, served, as, a, sort, of, commercial, street, with, shops, eating, places, a, nursery, school, and, recreational, facilities, a, running, track, and, small, stage, for, theatre, performances, were, located, on, the, roof, the, building, itself, was, surrounded, by, trees, and, a, small, park, le, corbusier, wrote, later, that, the, unit, d, habitation, concept, was, inspired, by, the, visit, he, had, made, to, the, florence, charterhouse, at, galluzzo, in, italy, in, 1907, and, 1910, during, his, early, travels, he, wanted, to, recreate, he, wrote, an, ideal, place, for, meditation, and, contemplation, he, also, learned, from, the, monastery, he, wrote, that, standardization, led, to, perfection, and, that, all, of, his, life, a, man, labours, under, this, impulse, to, make, the, home, the, temple, of, the, family, the, unit, d, habitation, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, career, of, le, corbusier, in, 1952, he, was, made, a, commander, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, in, a, ceremony, held, on, the, roof, of, his, new, building, he, had, progressed, from, being, an, outsider, and, critic, of, the, architectural, establishment, to, its, centre, as, the, most, prominent, french, architect, le, corbusier, made, another, almost, identical, unit, d, habitation, in, rez, les, nantes, in, the, loire, atlantique, department, between, 1948, and, 1952, and, three, more, over, the, following, years, in, berlin, briey, en, for, t, and, firminy, and, he, designed, a, factory, for, the, company, of, claude, and, duval, in, saint, di, in, the, vosges, in, the, post, second, world, war, decades, le, corbusier, s, fame, moved, beyond, architectural, and, planning, circles, as, he, became, one, of, the, leading, intellectual, figures, of, the, time, in, early, 1947, le, corbusier, submitted, a, design, for, the, headquarters, of, the, united, nations, which, was, to, be, built, beside, the, east, river, in, new, york, instead, of, competition, the, design, was, to, be, selected, by, a, board, of, design, consultants, composed, of, leading, international, architects, nominated, by, member, governments, including, le, corbusier, oscar, niemeyer, of, brazil, howard, robertson, from, britain, nikolai, bassov, of, the, soviet, union, and, five, others, from, around, the, world, the, committee, was, under, the, direction, of, the, american, architect, wallace, k, harrison, who, was, also, the, architect, for, the, rockefeller, family, which, had, donated, the, site, for, the, building, le, corbusier, had, submitted, his, plan, for, the, secretariat, called, plan, 23, of, the, 58, submitted, in, le, corbusier, s, plan, offices, council, chambers, and, general, assembly, hall, were, in, a, single, block, in, the, centre, of, the, site, he, lobbied, hard, for, his, project, and, asked, the, younger, brazilian, architect, niemeyer, to, support, and, assist, him, with, his, plan, niemeyer, to, help, le, corbusier, refused, to, submit, his, design, and, did, not, attend, the, meetings, until, the, director, harrison, insisted, niemeyer, then, submitted, his, plan, plan, 32, with, the, office, building, and, councils, and, general, assembly, in, separate, buildings, after, much, discussion, the, committee, chose, niemeyer, s, plan, but, suggested, that, he, collaborate, with, le, corbusier, on, the, final, project, le, corbusier, urged, niemeyer, to, put, the, general, assembly, hall, in, the, centre, of, the, site, though, this, would, eliminate, niemeyer, s, plan, to, have, a, large, plaza, in, the, centre, niemeyer, agreed, with, le, corbusier, s, suggestion, and, the, headquarters, was, built, with, minor, modifications, according, to, their, joint, plan, le, corbusier, was, an, avowed, atheist, but, he, also, had, a, strong, belief, in, the, ability, of, architecture, to, create, a, sacred, and, spiritual, environment, in, the, postwar, years, he, designed, two, important, religious, buildings, the, chapel, of, notre, dame, du, haut, at, ronchamp, 1950, 1955, and, the, convent, of, sainte, marie, de, la, tourette, 1953, 1960, le, corbusier, wrote, later, that, he, was, greatly, aided, in, his, religious, architecture, by, a, dominican, father, marie, alain, couturier, who, had, founded, a, movement, and, review, of, modern, religious, art, le, corbusier, first, visited, the, remote, mountain, site, of, ronchamp, in, may, 1950, saw, the, ruins, of, the, old, chapel, and, drew, sketches, of, possible, forms, he, wrote, afterwards, in, building, this, chapel, i, wanted, to, create, a, place, of, silence, of, peace, of, prayer, of, interior, joy, the, feeling, of, the, sacred, animated, our, effort, some, things, are, sacred, others, aren, t, whether, they, re, religious, or, not, the, second, major, religious, project, undertaken, by, le, corbusier, was, the, convent, of, sainte, marie, de, la, tourette, in, l, arbresle, in, the, rhone, department, 1953, 1960, once, again, it, was, father, couturier, who, engaged, le, corbusier, in, the, project, he, invited, le, corbusier, to, visit, the, starkly, simple, and, imposing, 12th, 13th, century, le, thoronet, abbey, in, provence, and, also, used, his, memories, of, his, youthful, visit, to, the, erna, charterhouse, in, florence, this, project, involved, not, only, a, chapel, but, a, library, refectory, rooms, for, meetings, and, reflection, and, dormitories, for, the, nuns, for, the, living, space, he, used, the, same, modulor, concept, for, measuring, the, ideal, living, space, that, he, had, used, in, the, unit, d, habitation, in, marseille, height, under, the, ceiling, of, 2, 26, metres, 7, feet, 5, inches, and, width, 1, 83, metres, 6, feet, 0, inches, le, corbusier, used, raw, concrete, to, construct, the, convent, which, is, placed, on, the, side, of, a, hill, the, three, blocks, of, dormitories, are, u, closed, by, the, chapel, with, a, courtyard, in, the, centre, the, convent, has, a, flat, roof, and, is, placed, on, sculpted, concrete, pillars, each, of, the, residential, cells, has, a, small, loggia, with, a, concrete, sunscreen, looking, out, at, the, countryside, the, centrepiece, of, the, convent, is, the, chapel, a, plain, box, of, concrete, which, he, called, his, box, of, miracles, unlike, the, highly, finished, fa, ade, of, the, unit, d, habitation, the, fa, ade, of, the, chapel, is, raw, unfinished, concrete, he, described, the, building, in, a, letter, to, albert, camus, in, 1957, i, m, taken, with, the, idea, of, a, box, of, miracles, as, the, name, indicates, it, is, a, rectangular, box, made, of, concrete, it, doesn, t, have, any, of, the, traditional, theatrical, tricks, but, the, possibility, as, its, name, suggests, to, make, miracles, the, interior, of, the, chapel, is, extremely, simple, only, benches, in, a, plain, unfinished, concrete, box, with, light, coming, through, a, single, square, in, the, roof, and, six, small, bands, on, the, sides, the, crypt, beneath, has, intense, blue, red, and, yellow, walls, and, illumination, by, sunlight, channelled, from, above, the, monastery, has, other, unusual, features, including, floor, to, ceiling, panels, of, glass, in, the, meeting, rooms, window, panels, that, fragmented, the, view, into, pieces, and, a, system, of, concrete, and, metal, tubes, like, gun, barrels, which, aimed, sunlight, through, coloured, prisms, and, projected, it, onto, the, walls, of, the, sacristy, and, to, the, secondary, altars, of, the, crypt, on, the, level, below, these, were, whimsically, termed, the, machine, guns, of, the, sacristy, and, the, light, cannons, of, the, crypt, in, 1960, le, corbusier, began, a, third, religious, building, the, church, of, saint, pierre, in, the, new, town, of, firminy, vert, where, he, had, built, a, unit, d, habitation, and, a, cultural, and, sports, centre, while, he, made, the, original, design, construction, did, not, begin, until, five, years, after, his, death, and, work, continued, under, different, architects, until, it, was, completed, in, 2006, the, most, spectacular, feature, of, the, church, is, the, sloping, concrete, tower, that, covers, the, entire, interior, similar, to, that, in, the, assembly, building, in, his, complex, at, chandigarh, windows, high, in, the, tower, illuminates, the, interior, le, corbusier, originally, proposed, that, tiny, windows, also, project, the, form, of, a, constellation, on, the, walls, later, architects, designed, the, church, to, project, the, constellation, orion, le, corbusier, s, largest, and, most, ambitious, project, was, the, design, of, chandigarh, the, capital, city, of, the, punjab, and, haryana, states, of, india, created, after, india, received, independence, in, 1947, le, corbusier, was, contacted, in, 1950, by, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, and, invited, to, propose, a, project, an, american, architect, albert, mayer, had, made, a, plan, in, 1947, for, a, city, of, 150, 000, inhabitants, but, the, indian, government, wanted, a, grander, and, more, monumental, city, corbusier, worked, on, the, plan, with, two, british, specialists, in, urban, design, and, tropical, climate, architecture, maxwell, fry, and, jane, drew, and, with, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, who, moved, to, india, and, supervised, the, construction, until, his, death, le, corbusier, as, always, was, rhapsodic, about, his, project, it, will, be, a, city, of, trees, he, wrote, of, flowers, and, water, of, houses, as, simple, as, those, at, the, time, of, homer, and, of, a, few, splendid, edifices, of, the, highest, level, of, modernism, where, the, rules, of, mathematics, will, reign, his, plan, called, for, residential, commercial, and, industrial, areas, along, with, parks, and, transportation, infrastructure, in, the, middle, was, the, capitol, a, complex, of, four, major, government, buildings, the, palace, of, the, national, assembly, the, high, court, of, justice, the, palace, of, secretariat, of, ministers, and, the, palace, of, the, governor, for, financial, and, political, reasons, the, palace, of, the, governor, was, dropped, well, into, the, construction, of, the, city, throwing, the, final, project, somewhat, off, balance, from, the, beginning, le, corbusier, worked, as, he, reported, like, a, forced, labourer, he, dismissed, the, earlier, american, plan, as, faux, moderne, and, overly, filled, with, parking, spaces, and, roads, he, intended, to, present, what, he, had, learned, in, forty, years, of, urban, study, and, also, to, show, the, french, government, the, opportunities, they, had, missed, in, not, choosing, him, to, rebuild, french, cities, after, the, war, his, design, made, use, of, many, of, his, favourite, ideas, an, architectural, promenade, incorporating, the, local, landscape, and, the, sunlight, and, shadows, into, the, design, the, use, of, the, modulor, to, give, a, correct, human, scale, to, each, element, somewhat, based, on, the, proportions, of, the, human, body, and, his, favourite, symbol, the, open, hand, the, hand, is, open, to, give, and, to, receive, he, placed, a, monumental, open, hand, statue, in, a, prominent, place, in, the, design, le, corbusier, s, design, called, for, the, use, of, raw, concrete, whose, surface, was, not, smoothed, or, polished, and, which, showed, the, marks, of, the, forms, in, which, it, dried, pierre, jeanneret, wrote, to, his, cousin, that, he, was, in, a, continual, battle, with, the, construction, workers, who, could, not, resist, the, urge, to, smooth, and, finish, the, raw, concrete, particularly, when, important, visitors, were, coming, to, the, site, at, one, point, one, thousand, workers, were, employed, on, the, site, of, the, high, court, of, justice, le, corbusier, wrote, to, his, mother, it, is, an, architectural, symphony, which, surpasses, all, my, hopes, which, flashes, and, develops, under, the, light, in, a, way, which, is, unimaginable, and, unforgettable, from, far, from, up, close, it, provokes, astonishment, all, made, with, raw, concrete, and, a, cement, cannon, adorable, and, grandiose, in, all, the, centuries, no, one, has, seen, that, the, high, court, of, justice, begun, in, 1951, was, finished, in, 1956, the, building, was, radical, in, its, design, a, parallelogram, topped, with, an, inverted, parasol, along, the, walls, were, high, concrete, grills, 1, 5, metres, 4, feet, 11, inches, thick, which, served, as, sunshades, the, entry, featured, a, monumental, ramp, and, columns, that, allowed, the, air, to, circulate, the, pillars, were, originally, white, limestone, but, in, the, 1960s, they, were, repainted, in, bright, colours, which, better, resisted, the, weather, the, secretariat, the, largest, building, that, housed, the, government, offices, was, constructed, between, 1952, and, 1958, it, is, an, enormous, block, 250, metres, 820, feet, long, and, eight, levels, high, served, by, a, ramp, which, extends, from, the, ground, to, the, top, level, the, ramp, was, designed, to, be, partly, sculptural, and, partly, practical, since, there, were, no, modern, building, cranes, at, the, time, of, construction, the, ramp, was, the, only, way, to, get, materials, to, the, top, of, the, construction, site, the, secretariat, had, two, features, which, were, borrowed, from, his, design, for, the, unit, d, habitation, in, marseille, concrete, grill, sunscreens, over, the, windows, and, a, roof, terrace, the, most, important, building, of, the, capitol, complex, was, the, palace, of, assembly, 1952, 61, which, faced, the, high, court, at, the, other, end, of, a, five, hundred, meter, esplanade, with, a, large, reflecting, pool, in, the, front, this, building, features, a, central, courtyard, over, which, is, the, main, meeting, hall, for, the, assembly, on, the, roof, on, the, rear, of, the, building, is, a, signature, feature, of, le, corbusier, a, large, tower, similar, in, form, to, the, smokestack, of, a, ship, or, the, ventilation, tower, of, a, heating, plant, le, corbusier, added, touches, of, colour, and, texture, with, an, immense, tapestry, in, the, meeting, hall, and, a, large, gateway, decorated, with, enamel, he, wrote, of, this, building, a, palace, magnificent, in, its, effect, from, the, new, art, of, raw, concrete, it, is, magnificent, and, terrible, terrible, meaning, that, there, is, nothing, cold, about, it, to, the, eyes, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, were, a, difficult, period, for, le, corbusier, s, personal, life, his, wife, yvonne, died, in, 1957, and, his, mother, to, whom, he, was, closely, attached, died, in, 1960, he, remained, active, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, in, 1955, he, published, po, me, de, l, angle, droit, a, portfolio, of, lithographs, published, in, the, same, collection, as, the, book, jazz, by, henri, matisse, in, 1958, he, collaborated, with, the, composer, edgar, var, se, on, a, work, called, le, po, me, lectronique, a, show, of, sound, and, light, for, the, philips, pavilion, at, the, international, exposition, in, brussels, in, 1960, he, published, a, new, book, l, atelier, de, la, recherch, patiente, the, workshop, of, patient, research, simultaneously, published, in, four, languages, he, received, growing, recognition, for, his, pioneering, work, in, modernist, architecture, in, 1959, a, successful, international, campaign, was, launched, to, have, his, villa, savoye, threatened, with, demolition, declared, a, historic, monument, it, was, the, first, time, that, a, work, by, a, living, architect, had, received, this, distinction, in, 1962, in, the, same, year, as, the, dedication, of, the, palace, of, the, assembly, in, chandigarh, the, first, retrospective, exhibit, on, his, work, was, held, at, the, national, museum, of, modern, art, in, paris, in, 1964, in, a, ceremony, held, in, his, atelier, on, rue, de, s, vres, he, was, awarded, the, grand, cross, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, by, culture, minister, andr, malraux, his, later, architectural, work, was, extremely, varied, and, often, based, on, designs, of, earlier, projects, in, 1952, 1958, he, designed, a, series, of, tiny, holiday, cabins, 2, 26, by, 2, 26, by, 2, 6, metres, 7, 4, by, 7, 4, by, 8, 5, feet, in, size, for, a, site, next, to, the, mediterranean, at, roquebrune, cap, martin, he, built, a, similar, cabin, for, himself, but, the, rest, of, the, project, was, not, realized, until, after, his, death, from, 1953, to, 1957, he, designed, the, maison, du, br, sil, a, residential, building, for, brazilian, students, for, the, cit, universitaire, in, paris, between, 1954, and, 1959, he, built, the, national, museum, of, western, art, in, tokyo, his, other, projects, included, a, cultural, centre, and, stadium, for, the, town, of, firminy, where, he, had, built, his, first, housing, project, 1955, 1958, and, a, stadium, in, baghdad, iraq, much, altered, since, its, construction, he, also, constructed, three, new, unit, s, d, habitation, apartment, blocks, on, the, model, of, the, original, in, marseille, the, first, in, berlin, 1956, 1958, the, second, in, briey, en, for, t, in, the, meurthe, et, moselle, department, and, the, third, 1959, 1967, in, firminy, from, 1960, to, 1963, he, built, his, only, building, in, the, united, states, the, carpenter, center, for, the, visual, arts, in, cambridge, massachusetts, j, rn, utzon, the, architect, of, the, sydney, opera, house, commissioned, le, corbusier, to, create, furnishings, for, the, nascent, opera, house, le, corbusier, designed, a, tapestry, les, d, s, sont, jet, s, which, was, completed, in, 1960, le, corbusier, died, of, a, heart, attack, at, age, 77, in, 1965, after, swimming, on, the, french, riviera, at, the, time, of, his, death, several, projects, were, on, the, drawing, board, the, church, of, saint, pierre, in, firminy, finally, completed, in, modified, form, in, 2006, a, palace, of, congresses, for, strasbourg, 1962, 65, and, a, hospital, in, venice, 1961, 1965, which, were, never, built, le, corbusier, designed, an, art, gallery, beside, the, lake, in, z, rich, for, gallery, owner, heidi, weber, in, 1962, 1967, now, called, the, centre, le, corbusier, it, is, one, of, his, last, finished, works, the, fondation, le, corbusier, flc, functions, as, his, official, estate, the, us, copyright, representative, for, the, fondation, le, corbusier, is, the, artists, rights, society, le, corbusier, defined, the, principles, of, his, new, architecture, in, les, cinq, points, de, l, architecture, moderne, published, in, 1927, and, co, authored, by, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, they, summarized, the, lessons, he, had, learned, in, the, previous, years, which, he, put, literally, into, concrete, form, in, his, villas, constructed, in, the, late, 1920s, most, dramatically, in, the, villa, savoye, 1928, 1931, the, five, points, are, the, architectural, promenade, was, another, idea, dear, to, le, corbusier, which, he, particularly, put, into, play, in, his, design, of, the, villa, savoye, in, 1928, in, une, maison, un, palais, he, described, it, arab, architecture, gives, us, a, precious, lesson, it, is, best, appreciated, in, walking, on, foot, it, is, in, walking, in, going, from, one, place, to, another, that, you, see, develop, the, features, of, the, architecture, in, this, house, villa, savoye, you, find, a, veritable, architectural, promenade, offering, constantly, varying, aspects, unexpected, sometimes, astonishing, the, promenade, at, villa, savoye, le, corbusier, wrote, both, in, the, interior, of, the, house, and, on, the, roof, terrace, often, erased, the, traditional, difference, between, the, inside, and, outside, in, the, 1930s, le, corbusier, expanded, and, reformulated, his, ideas, on, urbanism, eventually, publishing, them, in, la, ville, radieuse, the, radiant, city, in, 1935, perhaps, the, most, significant, difference, between, the, contemporary, city, and, the, radiant, city, is, that, the, latter, abandoned, the, class, based, stratification, of, the, former, housing, was, now, assigned, according, to, family, size, not, economic, position, some, have, read, dark, overtones, into, the, radiant, city, from, the, astonishingly, beautiful, assemblage, of, buildings, that, was, stockholm, for, example, le, corbusier, saw, only, frightening, chaos, and, saddening, monotony, he, dreamed, of, cleaning, and, purging, the, city, bringing, a, calm, and, powerful, architecture, referring, to, steel, plate, glass, and, reinforced, concrete, although, le, corbusier, s, designs, for, stockholm, did, not, succeed, later, architects, took, his, ideas, and, partly, destroyed, the, city, with, them, le, corbusier, hoped, that, politically, minded, industrialists, in, france, would, lead, the, way, with, their, efficient, taylorist, and, fordist, strategies, adopted, from, american, industrial, models, to, reorganize, society, as, norma, evenson, has, put, it, the, proposed, city, appeared, to, some, an, audacious, and, compelling, vision, of, a, brave, new, world, and, to, others, a, frigid, megalomaniacally, scaled, negation, of, the, familiar, urban, ambient, le, corbusier, his, ideas, his, urban, planning, and, his, architecture, are, viewed, separately, perelman, noted, whereas, they, are, the, same, thing, in, la, ville, radieuse, he, conceived, an, essentially, apolitical, society, in, which, the, bureaucracy, of, economic, administration, effectively, replaces, the, state, le, corbusier, was, heavily, indebted, to, the, thought, of, the, 19th, century, french, utopians, saint, simon, and, charles, fourier, there, is, a, noteworthy, resemblance, between, the, concept, of, the, unit, and, fourier, s, phalanstery, from, fourier, le, corbusier, adopted, at, least, in, part, his, notion, of, administrative, rather, than, political, government, the, modulor, was, a, standard, model, of, the, human, form, which, le, corbusier, devised, to, determine, the, correct, amount, of, living, space, needed, for, residents, in, his, buildings, it, was, also, his, rather, original, way, of, dealing, with, differences, between, the, metric, system, and, the, british, or, american, system, since, the, modulor, was, not, attached, to, either, one, le, corbusier, explicitly, used, the, golden, ratio, in, his, modulor, system, for, the, scale, of, architectural, proportion, he, saw, this, system, as, a, continuation, of, the, long, tradition, of, vitruvius, leonardo, da, vinci, s, vitruvian, man, the, work, of, leon, battista, alberti, and, others, who, used, the, proportions, of, the, human, body, to, improve, the, appearance, and, function, of, architecture, in, addition, to, the, golden, ratio, le, corbusier, based, the, system, on, human, measurements, fibonacci, numbers, and, the, double, unit, many, scholars, see, the, modulor, as, a, humanistic, expression, but, it, is, also, argued, that, it, s, exactly, the, opposite, it, s, the, mathematization, of, the, body, the, standardization, of, the, body, the, rationalization, of, the, body, he, took, leonardo, s, suggestion, of, the, golden, ratio, in, human, proportions, to, an, extreme, he, sectioned, his, model, human, body, s, height, at, the, navel, with, the, two, sections, in, golden, ratio, then, subdivided, those, sections, in, golden, ratio, at, the, knees, and, throat, he, used, these, golden, ratio, proportions, in, the, modulor, system, le, corbusier, s, 1927, villa, stein, in, garches, exemplified, the, modulor, system, s, application, the, villa, s, rectangular, ground, plan, elevation, and, inner, structure, closely, approximate, golden, rectangles, le, corbusier, placed, systems, of, harmony, and, proportion, at, the, centre, of, his, design, philosophy, and, his, faith, in, the, mathematical, order, of, the, universe, was, closely, bound, to, the, golden, section, and, the, fibonacci, series, which, he, described, as, rhythms, apparent, to, the, eye, and, clear, in, their, relations, with, one, another, and, these, rhythms, are, at, the, very, root, of, human, activities, they, resound, in, man, by, an, organic, inevitability, the, same, fine, inevitability, which, causes, the, tracing, out, of, the, golden, section, by, children, old, men, savages, and, the, learned, the, open, hand, la, main, ouverte, is, a, recurring, motif, in, le, corbusier, s, architecture, a, sign, for, him, of, peace, and, reconciliation, it, is, open, to, give, and, open, to, receive, the, largest, of, the, many, open, hand, sculptures, that, le, corbusier, created, is, a, 26, meter, high, 85, ft, version, in, chandigarh, india, known, as, open, hand, monument, le, corbusier, was, an, eloquent, critic, of, the, finely, crafted, hand, made, furniture, made, with, rare, and, exotic, woods, inlays, and, coverings, presented, at, the, 1925, exposition, of, decorative, arts, following, his, usual, method, le, corbusier, first, wrote, a, book, with, his, theories, of, furniture, complete, with, memorable, slogans, in, his, 1925, book, l, art, d, coratif, d, aujourd, hui, he, called, for, furniture, that, used, inexpensive, materials, and, could, be, mass, produced, le, corbusier, described, three, different, furniture, types, type, needs, type, furniture, and, human, limb, objects, he, defined, human, limb, objects, as, extensions, of, our, limbs, and, adapted, to, human, functions, that, are, type, needs, and, type, functions, therefore, type, objects, and, type, furniture, the, human, limb, object, is, a, docile, servant, a, good, servant, is, discreet, and, self, effacing, to, leave, his, master, free, certainly, works, of, art, are, tools, beautiful, tools, and, long, live, the, good, taste, manifested, by, choice, subtlety, proportion, and, harmony, he, further, declared, chairs, are, architecture, sofas, are, bourgeois, le, corbusier, first, relied, on, ready, made, furniture, from, thonet, to, furnish, his, projects, such, as, his, pavilion, at, the, 1925, exposition, in, 1928, following, the, publication, of, his, theories, he, began, experimenting, with, furniture, design, in, 1928, he, invited, the, architect, charlotte, perriand, to, join, his, studio, as, a, furniture, designer, his, cousin, pierre, jeanneret, also, collaborated, on, many, of, the, designs, for, the, manufacture, of, his, furniture, he, turned, to, the, german, firm, gebr, der, thonet, which, had, begun, making, chairs, with, tubular, steel, a, material, originally, used, for, bicycles, in, the, early, 1920s, le, corbusier, admired, the, design, of, marcel, breuer, and, the, bauhaus, who, in, 1925, had, begun, making, sleek, modern, tubular, club, chairs, mies, van, der, rohe, had, begun, making, his, version, in, a, sculptural, curved, form, with, a, cane, seat, in, 1927, the, first, results, of, the, collaboration, between, le, corbusier, and, perriand, were, three, types, of, chairs, made, with, chrome, plated, tubular, steel, frames, the, lc4, chaise, longue, 1927, 28, with, a, covering, of, cowhide, which, gave, it, a, touch, of, exoticism, the, fauteuil, grand, confort, lc3, 1928, 29, a, club, chair, with, a, tubular, frame, which, resembled, the, comfortable, art, deco, club, chairs, that, became, popular, in, the, 1920s, and, the, fauteuil, dossier, vascular, lc4, 1928, 29, a, low, seat, suspended, in, a, tubular, steel, frame, also, with, cowhide, upholstery, these, chairs, were, designed, specifically, for, two, of, his, projects, the, maison, la, roche, in, paris, and, a, pavilion, for, barbara, and, henry, church, all, three, clearly, showed, the, influence, of, mies, van, der, rohe, and, marcel, breuer, the, line, of, furniture, was, expanded, with, additional, designs, for, le, corbusier, s, 1929, salon, d, automne, installation, equipment, for, the, home, despite, the, intention, of, le, corbusier, that, his, furniture, should, be, inexpensive, and, mass, produced, his, pieces, were, originally, costly, to, make, and, were, not, mass, produced, until, many, years, later, when, he, was, famous, there, is, debate, over, the, apparently, variable, or, contradictory, nature, of, le, corbusier, s, political, views, in, the, 1920s, he, co, founded, and, contributed, articles, about, urbanism, to, the, fascist, journals, plans, pr, lude, and, l, homme, r, el, he, also, penned, pieces, in, favour, of, nazi, antisemitism, for, those, journals, as, well, as, hateful, editorials, between, 1925, and, 1928, le, corbusier, had, connections, to, le, faisceau, a, short, lived, french, fascist, party, led, by, georges, valois, valois, later, became, an, anti, fascist, le, corbusier, knew, another, former, member, of, faisceau, hubert, lagardelle, a, former, labor, leader, and, syndicalist, who, had, become, disaffected, with, the, political, left, in, 1934, after, lagardelle, had, obtained, a, position, at, the, french, embassy, in, rome, he, arranged, for, le, corbusier, to, lecture, on, architecture, in, italy, lagardelle, later, served, as, minister, of, labor, in, the, pro, axis, vichy, regime, while, le, corbusier, sought, commissions, from, the, vichy, regime, particularly, the, redesign, of, marseille, after, its, jewish, population, had, been, forcefully, removed, he, was, unsuccessful, and, the, only, appointment, he, received, from, it, was, membership, of, a, committee, studying, urbanism, alexis, carrel, a, eugenicist, surgeon, appointed, le, corbusier, to, the, department, of, bio, sociology, of, the, foundation, for, the, study, of, human, problems, an, institute, promoting, eugenics, policies, under, the, vichy, regime, le, corbusier, has, been, accused, of, antisemitism, he, wrote, to, his, mother, in, october, 1940, as, the, vichy, government, enacted, anti, jewish, laws, the, jews, are, having, a, bad, time, i, occasionally, feel, sorry, but, it, appears, their, blind, lust, for, money, has, rotted, the, country, he, was, also, accused, of, belittling, the, muslim, population, of, algeria, then, part, of, france, when, le, corbusier, proposed, a, plan, for, the, rebuilding, of, algiers, he, condemned, the, existing, housing, for, european, algerians, complaining, that, it, was, inferior, to, that, inhabited, by, indigenous, algerians, the, civilized, live, like, rats, in, holes, while, the, barbarians, live, in, solitude, in, well, being, his, plan, for, rebuilding, algiers, was, rejected, and, thereafter, le, corbusier, mostly, avoided, politics, in, his, eulogy, to, le, corbusier, at, the, memorial, ceremony, for, the, architect, in, the, courtyard, of, the, louvre, on, 1, september, 1965, french, culture, minister, andr, malraux, declared, le, corbusier, had, some, great, rivals, but, none, of, them, had, the, same, significance, in, the, revolution, of, architecture, because, none, bore, insults, so, patiently, and, for, so, long, later, criticism, of, le, corbusier, was, directed, at, his, ideas, on, urban, planning, in, 1998, the, architectural, historian, witold, rybczynski, wrote, in, time, magazine, he, called, it, the, ville, radieuse, the, radiant, city, despite, the, poetic, title, his, urban, vision, was, authoritarian, inflexible, and, simplistic, wherever, it, was, tried, in, chandigarh, by, le, corbusier, himself, or, in, brasilia, by, his, followers, it, failed, standardization, proved, inhuman, and, disorienting, the, open, spaces, were, inhospitable, the, bureaucratically, imposed, plan, was, socially, destructive, in, the, us, the, radiant, city, took, the, form, of, vast, urban, renewal, schemes, and, regimented, public, housing, projects, that, damaged, the, urban, fabric, beyond, repair, today, these, megaprojects, are, being, dismantled, as, superblocks, give, way, to, rows, of, houses, fronting, streets, and, sidewalks, downtowns, have, discovered, that, combining, not, separating, different, activities, is, the, key, to, success, so, is, the, presence, of, lively, residential, neighbourhoods, old, as, well, as, new, cities, have, learned, that, preserving, history, makes, more, sense, than, starting, from, zero, it, has, been, an, expensive, lesson, and, not, one, that, le, corbusier, intended, but, it, too, is, part, of, his, legacy, technological, historian, and, architecture, critic, lewis, mumford, wrote, in, yesterday, s, city, of, tomorrow, that, the, extravagant, heights, of, le, corbusier, s, skyscrapers, had, no, reason, for, existence, apart, from, the, fact, that, they, had, become, technological, possibilities, the, open, spaces, in, his, central, areas, had, no, reason, for, existence, either, mumford, wrote, since, on, the, scale, he, imagined, there, was, no, motive, during, the, business, day, for, pedestrian, circulation, in, the, office, quarter, by, mating, utilitarian, and, financial, image, of, the, skyscraper, city, to, the, romantic, image, of, the, organic, environment, le, corbusier, had, produced, a, sterile, hybrid, the, public, housing, projects, influenced, by, his, ideas, have, been, criticized, for, isolating, poor, communities, in, monolithic, high, rises, and, breaking, the, social, ties, integral, to, a, community, s, development, one, of, his, most, influential, detractors, has, been, jane, jacobs, who, delivered, a, scathing, critique, of, le, corbusier, s, urban, design, theories, in, her, seminal, work, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, for, some, critics, the, urbanism, of, le, corbusier, was, the, model, for, a, fascist, state, these, critics, cited, le, corbusier, himself, when, he, wrote, that, not, all, citizens, could, become, leaders, the, technocratic, elite, the, industrialists, financiers, engineers, and, artists, would, be, located, in, the, city, centre, while, the, workers, would, be, removed, to, the, fringes, of, the, city, alessandro, hseuh, bruni, wrote, in, le, corbusier, s, fatal, flaws, a, critique, of, modernism, that, in, addition, to, setting, the, stage, for, infrastructural, developments, to, come, le, corbusier, s, blueprints, and, models, while, not, so, well, regarded, by, urban, planners, and, street, dwellers, alike, also, examined, the, sociological, side, of, cities, in, great, detail, world, war, ii, left, millions, dead, and, transformed, the, urban, landscape, throughout, much, of, europe, from, england, to, the, soviet, union, and, housing, on, a, mass, scale, was, necessary, le, corbusier, personally, took, this, as, a, challenge, to, accommodate, the, masses, on, an, unprecedented, scale, this, mission, statement, manifested, itself, in, the, form, of, cit, radieuse, the, radiant, city, located, in, marseille, france, the, construction, of, this, utopian, sanctuary, was, dependent, on, the, destruction, of, traditional, neighbourhoods, he, showed, no, regard, for, french, cultural, heritage, and, tradition, entire, neighbourhoods, were, ravaged, to, make, way, for, these, dense, uniform, concrete, blocks, if, he, had, his, way, paris, elite, marais, community, would, have, been, destroyed, in, addition, the, theme, of, segregation, that, plagued, earlier, models, of, le, corbusier, s, continued, in, this, supposed, utopian, vision, with, the, wealthy, elite, being, the, only, ones, to, access, the, luxuries, of, modernism, le, corbusier, was, concerned, about, problems, he, saw, in, industrial, cities, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, he, thought, industrial, housing, techniques, led, to, crowding, dirtiness, and, a, lack, of, a, moral, landscape, he, was, a, leader, of, the, modernist, movement, to, create, better, living, conditions, and, a, better, society, through, housing, ebenezer, howard, s, garden, cities, of, tomorrow, heavily, influenced, le, corbusier, and, his, contemporaries, le, corbusier, revolutionized, urban, planning, and, was, a, founding, member, of, the, congr, s, international, d, architecture, moderne, ciam, one, of, the, first, to, realize, how, the, automobile, would, change, human, society, le, corbusier, conceived, the, city, of, the, future, with, large, apartment, buildings, isolated, in, a, park, like, setting, on, pilotis, le, corbusier, s, plans, were, adopted, by, builders, of, public, housing, in, europe, and, the, united, states, in, great, britain, urban, planners, turned, to, le, corbusier, s, cities, in, the, sky, as, a, cheaper, method, of, building, public, housing, from, the, late, 1950s, le, corbusier, criticized, any, effort, at, ornamentation, of, the, buildings, several, of, the, many, architects, who, worked, for, le, corbusier, in, his, studio, became, prominent, including, painter, architect, nadir, afonso, who, absorbed, le, corbusier, s, ideas, into, his, aesthetics, theory, l, cio, costa, s, city, plan, of, bras, lia, and, the, industrial, city, of, zl, n, planned, by, franti, ek, lydie, gahura, in, the, czech, republic, are, based, on, his, ideas, le, corbusier, s, thinking, had, profound, effects, on, city, planning, and, architecture, in, the, soviet, union, during, the, constructivist, era, le, corbusier, harmonized, and, lent, credence, to, the, idea, of, space, as, a, set, of, destinations, between, which, mankind, moved, continuously, he, gave, credibility, to, the, automobile, as, a, transporter, and, freeway, in, urban, spaces, his, philosophies, were, useful, to, urban, real, estate, developers, in, the, american, post, world, war, ii, period, because, they, justified, and, lent, intellectual, support, to, the, desire, to, raze, traditional, urban, spaces, for, high, density, high, profit, urban, concentration, the, freeways, connected, this, new, urbanism, to, low, density, low, cost, highly, profitable, suburban, locales, available, to, be, developed, for, middle, class, single, family, housing, missing, from, this, scheme, of, movement, was, connectivity, between, isolated, urban, villages, created, for, the, lower, middle, and, working, classes, and, the, destination, points, in, le, corbusier, s, plan, suburban, and, rural, areas, and, urban, commercial, centres, as, designed, the, freeways, travelled, over, at, or, beneath, grade, levels, of, the, living, spaces, of, the, urban, poor, for, example, the, cabrini, green, housing, project, in, chicago, because, such, projects, were, devoid, of, freeway, exit, ramps, and, were, cut, off, by, freeway, rights, of, way, they, became, isolated, from, the, jobs, and, services, that, had, been, concentrated, at, le, corbusier, s, nodal, transportation, endpoints, as, jobs, migrated, to, the, suburbs, these, urban, village, dwellers, effectively, found, themselves, stranded, without, freeway, access, points, in, their, communities, or, public, mass, transit, that, could, economically, reach, suburban, job, centres, late, in, the, post, war, period, suburban, job, centres, found, labour, shortages, to, be, such, a, critical, problem, that, they, sponsored, urban, to, suburban, shuttle, bus, services, to, fill, the, vacant, working, class, and, lower, middle, class, jobs, which, did, not, typically, pay, enough, to, afford, car, ownership, le, corbusier,
