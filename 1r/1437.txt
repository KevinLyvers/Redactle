khrushchev, s, position, as, party, leader, was, secure, until, about, 1962, but, as, he, aged, he, grew, more, erratic, and, his, performance, undermined, the, confidence, of, his, fellow, leaders, the, soviet, union, s, mounting, economic, problems, also, increased, the, pressure, on, khrushchev, s, leadership, brezhnev, remained, outwardly, loyal, to, khrushchev, but, became, involved, in, a, 1963, plot, to, remove, him, from, power, possibly, playing, a, leading, role, also, in, 1963, brezhnev, succeeded, frol, kozlov, another, khrushchev, prot, g, as, secretary, of, the, central,

for, his, work, in, office, anastas, mikoyan, visited, khrushchev, hinting, that, he, should, not, be, too, complacent, about, his, present, situation, vladimir, semichastny, head, of, the, kgb, was, a, crucial, part, of, the, conspiracy, as, it, was, his, duty, to, inform, khrushchev, if, anyone, was, plotting, against, his, leadership, nikolay, ignatov, whom, khrushchev, had, sacked, discreetly, requested, the, opinion, of, several, central, committee, members, after, some, false, starts, fellow, conspirator, mikhail, suslov, phoned, khrushchev, on, 12, october, and, requested, that, he, return, to, moscow, to, discuss, the, state, of, soviet, agriculture, finally, khrushchev, understood, what, was, happening, and, said, to, mikoyan, if, it, s, me, who, is, the, question, i, will, not, make, a, fight, of, it, while, a, minority, headed, by, mikoyan, wanted, to, remove, khrushchev, from, the, office, of, first, secretary, but, retain, him, as, the, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, the, majority, headed, by, brezhnev, wanted, to, remove, him, from, active, politics, altogether, brezhnev, and, nikolai, podgorny, appealed, to, the, central, committee, blaming, khrushchev, for, economic, failures, and, accusing, him, of, voluntarism, and, immodest, behavior, influenced, by, brezhnev, s, allies, politburo, members, voted, on, 14, october, to, remove, khrushchev, from, office, some, members, of, the, central, committee, wanted, him, to, undergo, punishment, of, some, kind, but, brezhnev, who, had, already, been, assured, the, office, of, the, general, secretary, saw, little, reason, to, punish, khrushchev, further, brezhnev, was, appointed, first, secretary, on, the, same, day, but, at, the, time, was, believed, to, be, a, transitional, leader, who, would, only, keep, the, shop, until, another, leader, was, appointed, alexei, kosygin, was, appointed, head, of, government, and, mikoyan, was, retained, as, head, of, state, brezhnev, and, his, companions, supported, the, general, party, line, taken, after, stalin, s, death, but, felt, that, khrushchev, s, reforms, had, removed, much, of, the, soviet, union, s, stability, one, reason, for, khrushchev, s, ouster, was, that, he, continually, overruled, other, party, members, and, was, according, to, the, plotters, in, contempt, of, the, party, s, collective, ideals, the, soviet, newspaper, pravda, wrote, of, new, enduring, themes, such, as, collective, leadership, scientific, planning, consultation, with, experts, organisational, regularity, and, the, ending, of, schemes, when, khrushchev, left, the, public, spotlight, there, was, no, popular, commotion, as, most, soviet, citizens, including, the, intelligentsia, anticipated, a, period, of, stabilization, steady, development, of, soviet, society, and, continuing, economic, growth, in, the, years, ahead, political, scientist, george, w, breslauer, has, compared, khrushchev, and, brezhnev, as, leaders, he, argues, they, took, different, routes, to, build, legitimate, authority, depending, on, their, personalities, and, the, state, of, public, opinion, khrushchev, worked, to, decentralize, the, government, system, and, empower, local, leadership, which, had, been, wholly, subservient, brezhnev, sought, to, centralize, authority, going, so, far, as, to, weaken, the, roles, of, the, other, members, of, the, central, committee, and, the, politburo, upon, replacing, khrushchev, as, the, party, s, first, secretary, brezhnev, became, the, de, jure, supreme, authority, of, the, soviet, union, however, he, was, initially, forced, to, govern, as, part, of, an, unofficial, triumvirate, also, known, by, its, russian, name, troika, alongside, the, country, s, premier, alexei, kosygin, and, nikolai, podgorny, a, secretary, of, the, cpsu, central, committee, and, later, chairman, of, the, presidium, due, to, khrushchev, s, disregard, for, the, rest, of, the, politburo, upon, combining, his, leadership, of, the, party, with, that, of, the, soviet, government, a, plenum, of, the, central, committee, in, october, 1964, forbade, any, single, individual, from, holding, both, the, offices, of, general, secretary, and, premier, this, arrangement, would, persist, until, the, late, 1970s, when, brezhnev, firmly, secured, his, position, as, the, most, powerful, figure, in, the, soviet, union, during, his, consolidation, of, power, brezhnev, first, had, to, contend, with, the, ambitions, of, alexander, shelepin, the, former, chairman, of, the, kgb, and, current, head, of, the, party, state, control, committee, in, early, 1965, shelepin, began, calling, for, the, restoration, of, obedience, and, order, within, the, soviet, union, as, part, of, his, own, bid, to, seize, power, towards, this, end, he, exploited, his, control, over, both, state, and, party, organs, to, leverage, support, within, the, regime, recognizing, shelepin, as, an, imminent, threat, to, his, position, brezhnev, mobilized, the, soviet, collective, leadership, to, remove, him, from, the, party, state, control, committee, before, having, the, body, dissolved, altogether, on, 6, december, 1965, by, the, end, of, 1965, brezhnev, had, podgorny, removed, from, the, secretariat, thereby, significantly, curtailing, the, latter, s, ability, to, build, support, within, the, party, apparatus, in, the, ensuing, years, podgorny, s, network, of, supporters, was, steadily, eroded, as, the, prot, g, s, he, cultivated, in, his, rise, to, power, were, removed, from, the, central, committee, by, 1977, brezhnev, was, secure, enough, in, his, position, to, replace, podgorny, as, head, of, state, and, remove, him, from, the, politburo, after, sidelining, shelepin, and, podgorny, as, threats, to, his, leadership, in, 1965, brezhnev, directed, his, attentions, to, his, remaining, political, rival, alexei, kosygin, in, the, 1960s, u, s, national, security, advisor, henry, kissinger, initially, perceived, kosygin, to, be, the, dominant, leader, of, soviet, foreign, policy, in, the, politburo, within, the, same, timeframe, kosygin, was, also, in, charge, of, economic, administration, in, his, role, as, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, however, his, position, was, weakened, following, his, enactment, of, several, economic, reforms, in, 1965, that, collectively, came, to, be, known, within, the, party, as, the, kosygin, reforms, due, largely, to, coinciding, with, the, prague, spring, whose, sharp, departure, from, the, soviet, model, led, to, its, armed, suppression, in, 1968, the, reforms, provoked, a, backlash, among, the, party, s, old, guard, who, proceeded, to, flock, to, brezhnev, and, strengthened, his, position, within, the, soviet, leadership, in, 1969, brezhnev, further, expanded, his, authority, following, a, clash, with, second, secretary, mikhail, suslov, who, thereafter, never, challenged, his, supremacy, within, the, politburo, brezhnev, was, adept, at, politics, within, the, soviet, power, structure, he, was, a, team, player, and, never, acted, rashly, or, hastily, unlike, khrushchev, he, did, not, make, decisions, without, substantial, consultation, from, his, colleagues, and, was, always, willing, to, hear, their, opinions, during, the, early, 1970s, brezhnev, consolidated, his, domestic, position, in, 1977, he, forced, the, retirement, of, podgorny, and, became, once, again, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, of, the, soviet, union, making, this, position, equivalent, to, that, of, an, executive, president, while, kosygin, remained, premier, until, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1980, replaced, by, nikolai, tikhonov, as, premier, brezhnev, was, the, dominant, figure, in, the, soviet, union, from, the, mid, 1970s, until, his, death, in, 1982, brezhnev, has, defined, the, iconic, developed, socialism, as, the, soviet, style, socialism, which, he, believed, had, successfully, constructed, socialism, in, the, soviet, union, and, reached, vladimir, lenin, s, transition, stage, from, socialism, to, communism, brezhnev, emphasized, the, advanced, technological, developments, in, the, ussr, with, full, electrification, of, the, country, the, use, of, nuclear, power, in, production, computer, planning, as, well, as, a, highly, mechanized, agriculture, he, believed, that, all, social, strata, within, the, ussr, were, closer, to, each, other, than, ever, before, due, to, the, highly, developed, productive, force, in, the, country, therefore, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, has, according, to, brezhnev, moved, towards, a, people, s, government, brezhnev, believed, that, all, socialist, countries, would, go, through, the, same, socialist, development, and, social, transformation, of, the, soviet, model, regardless, of, their, national, and, material, conditions, brezhnev, s, stabilization, policy, included, ending, the, liberalizing, reforms, of, khrushchev, and, clamping, down, on, cultural, freedom, during, the, khrushchev, years, brezhnev, had, supported, the, leader, s, denunciations, of, stalin, s, arbitrary, rule, the, rehabilitation, of, many, of, the, victims, of, stalin, s, purges, and, the, cautious, liberalization, of, soviet, intellectual, and, cultural, policy, however, as, soon, as, he, became, leader, of, the, soviet, union, he, began, to, reverse, this, process, and, developed, an, increasingly, authoritarian, and, conservative, attitude, by, the, mid, 1970s, there, were, an, estimated, 5, 000, political, and, religious, prisoners, across, the, soviet, union, living, in, grievous, conditions, and, suffering, from, malnutrition, many, of, these, prisoners, were, considered, by, the, soviet, state, to, be, mentally, unfit, and, were, hospitalized, in, mental, asylums, across, the, soviet, union, under, brezhnev, s, rule, the, kgb, infiltrated, most, if, not, all, anti, government, organisations, which, ensured, that, there, was, little, to, no, opposition, against, him, or, his, power, base, however, brezhnev, refrained, from, the, all, out, violence, seen, under, stalin, s, rule, the, trial, of, the, writers, yuli, daniel, and, andrei, sinyavsky, in, 1966, the, first, such, public, trials, since, stalin, s, reign, marked, the, reversion, to, a, repressive, cultural, policy, under, yuri, andropov, the, state, security, service, in, the, form, of, the, kgb, regained, some, of, the, powers, it, had, enjoyed, under, stalin, although, there, was, no, return, to, the, purges, of, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, and, stalin, s, legacy, remained, largely, discredited, among, the, soviet, intelligentsia, between, 1960, and, 1970, soviet, agriculture, output, increased, by, 3, annually, industry, also, improved, during, the, eighth, five, year, plan, 1966, 1970, the, output, of, factories, and, mines, increased, by, 138, compared, to, 1960, while, the, politburo, became, aggressively, anti, reformist, kosygin, was, able, to, convince, both, brezhnev, and, the, politburo, to, leave, the, reformist, communist, leader, j, nos, k, d, r, of, the, hungarian, people, s, republic, alone, because, of, an, economic, reform, entitled, new, economic, mechanism, nem, which, granted, limited, permission, for, the, establishment, of, retail, markets, in, the, polish, people, s, republic, another, approach, was, taken, in, 1970, under, the, leadership, of, edward, gierek, he, believed, that, the, government, needed, western, loans, to, facilitate, the, rapid, growth, of, heavy, industry, the, soviet, leadership, gave, its, approval, for, this, as, the, soviet, union, could, not, afford, to, maintain, its, massive, subsidy, for, the, eastern, bloc, in, the, form, of, cheap, oil, and, gas, exports, the, soviet, union, did, not, accept, all, kinds, of, reforms, an, example, being, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1968, in, response, to, alexander, dub, ek, s, reforms, under, brezhnev, the, politburo, abandoned, khrushchev, s, decentralization, experiments, by, 1966, two, years, after, taking, power, brezhnev, abolished, the, regional, economic, councils, which, were, organized, to, manage, the, regional, economies, of, the, soviet, union, the, ninth, five, year, plan, delivered, a, change, for, the, first, time, industrial, consumer, products, out, produced, industrial, capital, goods, consumer, goods, such, as, watches, furniture, and, radios, were, produced, in, abundance, the, plan, still, left, the, bulk, of, the, state, s, investment, in, industrial, capital, goods, production, this, outcome, was, not, seen, as, a, positive, sign, for, the, future, of, the, soviet, state, by, the, majority, of, top, party, functionaries, within, the, government, by, 1975, consumer, goods, were, expanding, 9, slower, than, industrial, capital, goods, the, policy, continued, despite, brezhnev, s, commitment, to, make, a, rapid, shift, of, investment, to, satisfy, soviet, consumers, and, lead, to, an, even, higher, standard, of, living, this, did, not, happen, during, 1928, 1973, the, soviet, union, was, growing, economically, at, a, faster, pace, than, the, united, states, and, western, europe, however, objective, comparisons, are, difficult, the, ussr, was, hampered, by, the, effects, of, world, war, ii, which, had, left, most, of, the, western, ussr, in, ruins, however, western, aid, and, soviet, espionage, in, the, period, 1941, 1945, culminating, in, cash, material, and, equipment, deliveries, for, military, and, industrial, purposes, had, allowed, the, russians, to, leapfrog, many, western, economies, in, the, development, of, advanced, technologies, particularly, in, the, fields, of, nuclear, technology, radio, communications, agriculture, and, heavy, manufacturing, by, the, early, 1970s, the, soviet, union, had, the, world, s, second, largest, industrial, capacity, and, produced, more, steel, oil, pig, iron, cement, and, tractors, than, any, other, country, before, 1973, the, soviet, economy, was, expanding, at, a, faster, rate, than, that, of, the, american, economy, albeit, by, a, very, small, margin, the, ussr, also, kept, a, steady, pace, with, the, economies, of, western, europe, between, 1964, and, 1973, the, soviet, economy, stood, at, roughly, half, the, output, per, head, of, western, europe, and, a, little, more, than, one, third, that, of, the, u, s, in, 1973, the, process, of, catching, up, with, the, rest, of, the, west, came, to, an, end, as, the, soviet, union, fell, further, and, further, behind, in, computer, technology, which, proved, decisive, for, the, western, economies, by, 1973, the, era, of, stagnation, was, apparent, the, era, of, stagnation, a, term, coined, by, mikhail, gorbachev, was, attributed, to, a, compilation, of, factors, including, the, ongoing, arms, race, the, soviet, union, s, decision, to, participate, in, international, trade, thus, abandoning, the, idea, of, economic, isolation, while, ignoring, changes, occurring, in, western, societies, increased, authoritarianism, in, soviet, society, the, invasion, of, afghanistan, the, bureaucracy, s, transformation, into, an, undynamic, gerontocracy, lack, of, economic, reform, pervasive, political, corruption, and, other, structural, problems, within, the, country, domestically, social, stagnation, was, stimulated, by, the, growing, demands, of, unskilled, workers, labor, shortages, and, a, decline, in, productivity, and, labor, discipline, while, brezhnev, albeit, sporadically, through, alexei, kosygin, attempted, to, reform, the, economy, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, he, failed, to, produce, any, positive, results, one, of, these, reforms, was, the, economic, reform, of, 1965, initiated, by, kosygin, though, its, origins, are, often, traced, back, to, the, khrushchev, era, the, reform, was, ultimately, cancelled, by, the, central, committee, though, the, committee, admitted, that, economic, problems, did, exist, after, becoming, leader, of, the, soviet, union, gorbachev, would, characterize, the, economy, under, brezhnev, s, rule, as, the, lowest, stage, of, socialism, based, on, its, surveillance, the, cia, reported, that, the, soviet, economy, peaked, in, the, 1970s, upon, reaching, 57, of, american, gnp, however, beginning, around, 1975, economic, growth, began, to, decline, at, least, in, part, due, to, the, regime, s, sustained, prioritization, of, heavy, industry, and, military, spending, over, consumer, goods, additionally, soviet, agriculture, was, unable, to, feed, the, urban, population, let, alone, provide, for, a, rising, standard, of, living, which, the, government, promised, as, the, fruits, of, mature, socialism, and, on, which, industrial, productivity, depended, ultimately, the, gnp, growth, rate, slowed, to, 1, to, 2, per, year, as, gnp, growth, rates, decreased, in, the, 1970s, from, the, level, held, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, they, likewise, began, to, lag, behind, that, of, western, europe, and, the, united, states, eventually, the, stagnation, reached, a, point, that, the, united, states, began, growing, an, average, of, 1, per, year, above, the, growth, rate, of, the, soviet, union, the, stagnation, of, the, soviet, economy, was, fueled, even, further, by, the, soviet, union, s, ever, widening, technological, gap, with, the, west, due, to, the, cumbersome, procedures, of, the, centralized, planning, system, soviet, industries, were, incapable, of, the, innovation, needed, to, meet, public, demand, this, was, especially, notable, in, the, field, of, computers, in, response, to, the, lack, of, uniform, standards, for, peripherals, and, digital, capacity, in, the, soviet, computer, industry, brezhnev, s, regime, ordered, an, end, to, all, independent, computer, development, and, required, all, future, models, to, be, based, on, the, ibm, 360, however, following, the, adoption, of, the, ibm, 360, system, the, soviet, union, was, never, able, to, build, enough, platforms, let, alone, improve, on, its, design, as, its, technology, continued, to, fall, behind, the, west, the, soviet, union, increasingly, resorted, to, pirating, western, designs, the, last, significant, reform, undertaken, by, the, kosygin, government, and, some, believe, in, the, pre, perestroika, era, was, a, joint, decision, of, the, central, committee, and, the, council, of, ministers, named, improving, planning, and, reinforcing, the, effects, of, the, economic, mechanism, on, raising, the, effectiveness, in, production, and, improving, the, quality, of, work, more, commonly, known, as, the, 1979, reform, the, reform, in, contrast, to, the, 1965, reform, sought, to, increase, the, central, government, s, economic, involvement, by, enhancing, the, duties, and, responsibilities, of, the, ministries, with, kosygin, s, death, in, 1980, and, due, to, his, successor, nikolai, tikhonov, s, conservative, approach, to, economics, very, little, of, the, reform, was, actually, carried, out, the, eleventh, five, year, plan, of, the, soviet, union, delivered, a, disappointing, result, a, change, in, growth, from, 5, to, 4, during, the, earlier, tenth, five, year, plan, there, had, been, target, of, 6, 1, growth, but, this, was, not, met, brezhnev, was, able, to, defer, economic, collapse, by, trading, with, western, europe, and, the, arab, world, the, soviet, union, still, outproduced, the, united, states, in, the, heavy, industry, sector, during, the, brezhnev, era, another, dramatic, result, of, brezhnev, s, rule, was, that, certain, eastern, bloc, countries, became, more, economically, advanced, than, the, soviet, union, brezhnev, s, agricultural, policy, reinforced, traditional, ways, of, organizing, collective, farms, and, enforced, output, quotas, centrally, although, there, was, a, record, high, state, investment, in, farming, during, the, 1970s, the, evaluation, of, agricultural, output, continued, to, focus, on, the, grain, harvest, despite, some, improvement, there, were, still, problems, such, as, insufficient, domestic, production, of, fodder, crops, and, a, declining, sugar, beet, harvest, brezhnev, attempted, to, address, these, issues, by, increasing, state, investment, and, allowing, privately, owned, plots, to, be, larger, however, these, actions, were, not, effective, in, solving, fundamental, problems, like, a, shortage, of, skilled, workers, a, ruined, rural, culture, and, inappropriate, farm, machinery, for, small, collective, farms, a, significant, reform, was, necessary, but, it, was, not, supported, due, to, ideological, and, political, considerations, brezhnev, s, agricultural, policy, reinforced, the, conventional, methods, for, organizing, the, collective, farms, output, quotas, continued, to, be, imposed, centrally, khrushchev, s, policy, of, amalgamating, farms, was, continued, by, brezhnev, because, he, shared, khrushchev, s, belief, that, bigger, kolkhozes, would, increase, productivity, brezhnev, pushed, for, an, increase, in, state, investments, in, farming, which, amounted, to, an, all, time, high, in, the, 1970s, of, 27, of, all, state, investment, this, figure, did, not, include, investments, in, farm, equipment, in, 1981, alone, 33, billion, u, s, dollars, by, contemporary, exchange, rate, was, invested, into, agriculture, agricultural, output, in, 1980, was, 21, higher, than, the, average, production, rate, between, 1966, and, 1970, cereal, crop, output, increased, by, 18, these, improved, results, were, not, encouraging, in, the, soviet, union, the, criterion, for, assessing, agricultural, output, was, the, grain, harvest, the, import, of, cereal, which, began, under, khrushchev, had, in, fact, become, a, normal, phenomenon, by, soviet, standards, when, brezhnev, had, difficulties, sealing, commercial, trade, agreements, with, the, united, states, he, went, elsewhere, such, as, to, argentina, trade, was, necessary, because, the, soviet, union, s, domestic, production, of, fodder, crops, was, severely, deficient, another, sector, that, was, hitting, the, wall, was, the, sugar, beet, harvest, which, had, declined, by, 2, in, the, 1970s, brezhnev, s, way, of, resolving, these, issues, was, to, increase, state, investment, politburo, member, gennady, voronov, advocated, for, the, division, of, each, farm, s, workforce, into, what, he, called, links, these, links, would, be, entrusted, with, specific, functions, such, as, to, run, a, farm, s, dairy, unit, his, argument, was, that, the, larger, the, work, force, the, less, responsible, they, felt, this, program, had, been, proposed, to, joseph, stalin, by, andrey, andreyev, in, the, 1940s, and, had, been, opposed, by, khrushchev, before, and, after, stalin, s, death, voronov, was, also, unsuccessful, brezhnev, turned, him, down, and, in, 1973, he, was, removed, from, the, politburo, experimentation, with, links, was, not, disallowed, on, a, local, basis, with, mikhail, gorbachev, the, then, first, secretary, of, the, stavropol, regional, committee, experimenting, with, links, in, his, region, in, the, meantime, the, soviet, government, s, involvement, in, agriculture, was, according, to, robert, service, otherwise, unimaginative, and, incompetent, facing, mounting, problems, with, agriculture, the, politburo, issued, a, resolution, titled, on, the, further, development, of, specialisation, and, concentration, of, agricultural, production, on, the, basis, of, inter, farm, co, operation, and, agro, industrial, integration, the, resolution, ordered, kolkhozes, close, to, each, other, to, collaborate, in, their, efforts, to, increase, production, in, the, meantime, the, state, s, subsidies, to, the, food, and, agriculture, sector, did, not, prevent, bankrupt, farms, from, operating, and, rises, in, the, price, of, produce, were, offset, by, rises, in, the, cost, of, oil, and, other, resources, by, 1977, oil, cost, 84, more, than, it, did, in, the, late, 1960s, the, cost, of, other, resources, had, also, climbed, by, the, late, 1970s, brezhnev, s, answer, to, these, problems, was, to, issue, two, decrees, one, in, 1977, and, one, in, 1981, which, called, for, an, increase, in, the, maximum, size, of, privately, owned, plots, within, the, soviet, union, to, half, a, hectare, these, measures, removed, important, obstacles, for, the, expansion, of, agricultural, output, but, did, not, solve, the, problem, under, brezhnev, private, plots, yielded, 30, of, the, national, agricultural, production, when, they, cultivated, only, 4, of, the, land, this, was, seen, by, some, as, proof, that, de, collectivization, was, necessary, to, prevent, soviet, agriculture, from, collapsing, but, leading, soviet, politicians, shrank, from, supporting, such, drastic, measures, due, to, ideological, and, political, interests, the, underlying, problems, were, the, growing, shortage, of, skilled, workers, a, wrecked, rural, culture, the, payment, of, workers, in, proportion, to, the, quantity, rather, than, the, quality, of, their, work, and, too, large, farm, machinery, for, the, small, collective, farms, and, the, roadless, countryside, in, the, face, of, this, brezhnev, s, only, options, were, schemes, such, as, large, land, reclamation, and, irrigation, projects, or, of, course, radical, reform, over, the, eighteen, years, that, brezhnev, ruled, the, soviet, union, average, income, per, head, increased, by, half, three, quarters, of, this, growth, came, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, during, the, second, half, of, brezhnev, s, premiership, the, average, income, per, head, grew, by, one, quarter, in, the, first, half, of, the, brezhnev, period, income, per, head, increased, by, 3, 5, per, annum, slightly, less, growth, than, what, it, had, been, the, previous, years, this, can, be, explained, by, brezhnev, s, reversal, of, most, of, khrushchev, s, policies, consumption, per, head, rose, by, an, estimated, 70, under, brezhnev, but, with, three, quarters, of, this, growth, happening, before, 1973, and, only, one, quarter, in, the, second, half, of, his, rule, most, of, the, increase, in, consumer, production, in, the, early, brezhnev, era, can, be, attributed, to, the, kosygin, reform, when, the, ussr, s, economic, growth, stalled, in, the, 1970s, the, standard, of, living, and, housing, quality, improved, significantly, instead, of, paying, more, attention, to, the, economy, the, soviet, leadership, under, brezhnev, tried, to, improve, the, living, standard, in, the, soviet, union, by, extending, social, benefits, this, led, to, an, increase, though, a, minor, one, in, public, support, the, standard, of, living, in, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, rsfsr, had, fallen, behind, that, of, the, georgian, soviet, socialist, republic, gssr, and, the, estonian, soviet, socialist, republic, essr, under, brezhnev, this, led, many, russians, to, believe, that, the, policies, of, the, soviet, government, were, hurting, the, russian, population, the, state, usually, moved, workers, from, one, job, to, another, which, ultimately, became, an, ineradicable, feature, in, the, soviet, industry, government, industries, such, as, factories, mines, and, offices, were, staffed, by, undisciplined, personnel, who, put, a, great, effort, into, not, doing, their, jobs, this, ultimately, led, according, to, robert, service, to, a, work, shy, workforce, the, soviet, government, had, no, effective, counter, measure, it, was, extremely, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, replace, ineffective, workers, because, of, the, country, s, lack, of, unemployment, while, some, areas, improved, during, the, brezhnev, era, the, majority, of, civilian, services, deteriorated, and, living, conditions, for, soviet, citizens, fell, rapidly, diseases, were, on, the, rise, because, of, the, decaying, healthcare, system, the, living, space, remained, rather, small, by, first, world, standards, with, the, average, soviet, person, living, on, 13, 4, square, metres, thousands, of, moscow, inhabitants, became, homeless, most, of, them, living, in, shacks, doorways, and, parked, trams, nutrition, ceased, to, improve, in, the, late, 1970s, while, rationing, of, staple, food, products, returned, to, sverdlovsk, for, instance, the, state, provided, recreation, facilities, and, annual, holidays, for, hard, working, citizens, soviet, trade, unions, rewarded, hard, working, members, and, their, families, with, beach, vacations, in, crimea, and, georgia, social, rigidification, became, a, common, feature, of, soviet, society, during, the, stalin, era, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, a, common, labourer, could, expect, promotion, to, a, white, collar, job, if, he, studied, and, obeyed, soviet, authorities, in, brezhnev, s, soviet, union, this, was, not, the, case, holders, of, attractive, positions, clung, to, them, as, long, as, possible, mere, incompetence, was, not, seen, as, a, good, reason, to, dismiss, anyone, in, this, way, too, the, soviet, society, brezhnev, passed, on, had, become, static, during, his, eighteen, years, as, leader, of, the, ussr, brezhnev, s, signature, foreign, policy, innovation, was, the, promotion, of, d, tente, while, sharing, some, similarities, with, approaches, pursued, during, the, khrushchev, thaw, brezhnev, s, policy, significantly, differed, from, khrushchev, s, precedent, in, two, ways, the, first, was, that, it, was, more, comprehensive, and, wide, ranging, in, its, aims, and, included, signing, agreements, on, arms, control, crisis, prevention, east, west, trade, european, security, and, human, rights, the, second, part, of, the, policy, was, based, on, the, importance, of, equalizing, the, military, strength, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, defense, spending, under, brezhnev, between, 1965, and, 1970, increased, by, 40, and, annual, increases, continued, thereafter, in, the, year, of, brezhnev, s, death, in, 1982, 12, of, gnp, was, spent, on, the, military, under, brezhnev, the, soviet, union, s, military, budget, increased, eightfold, resulting, in, the, possession, of, the, largest, number, of, icbms, nuclear, warheads, aircraft, tanks, conventional, forces, and, more, military, assets, this, build, up, led, numerous, observers, including, western, ones, to, argue, that, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, ussr, had, surpassed, the, united, states, as, the, world, s, strongest, military, power, at, the, 1972, moscow, summit, brezhnev, and, u, s, president, richard, nixon, signed, the, salt, i, treaty, the, first, part, of, the, agreement, set, limits, on, each, side, s, development, of, nuclear, missiles, the, second, part, of, the, agreement, the, anti, ballistic, missile, treaty, banned, both, countries, from, designing, systems, to, intercept, incoming, missiles, so, neither, the, u, s, or, the, soviet, union, would, be, emboldened, to, strike, the, other, without, fear, of, nuclear, retaliation, by, the, mid, 1970s, henry, kissinger, s, policy, of, d, tente, towards, the, soviet, union, was, faltering, the, d, tente, had, rested, on, the, assumption, that, a, linkage, of, some, type, could, be, found, between, the, two, countries, with, the, u, s, hoping, that, the, signing, of, salt, i, and, an, increase, in, soviet, u, s, trade, would, stop, the, aggressive, growth, of, communism, in, the, third, world, this, did, not, happen, as, evidenced, by, brezhnev, s, continued, military, support, for, the, communist, guerillas, fighting, against, the, u, s, during, the, vietnam, war, after, gerald, ford, lost, the, presidential, election, to, jimmy, carter, american, foreign, policies, became, more, overtly, aggressive, in, vocabulary, towards, the, soviet, union, and, the, communist, world, attempts, were, also, made, to, stop, funding, for, repressive, anti, communist, governments, and, organizations, the, united, states, supported, while, at, first, standing, for, a, decrease, in, all, defense, initiatives, the, later, years, of, carter, s, presidency, would, increase, spending, on, the, u, s, military, when, brezhnev, authorized, the, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, in, 1979, carter, following, the, advice, of, his, national, security, adviser, zbigniew, brzezinski, denounced, the, intervention, describing, it, as, the, most, serious, danger, to, peace, since, 1945, the, u, s, stopped, all, grain, exports, to, the, soviet, union, and, boycotted, the, 1980, summer, olympics, held, in, moscow, the, soviet, union, responded, by, boycotting, the, 1984, summer, olympics, held, in, los, angeles, during, brezhnev, s, rule, the, soviet, union, reached, the, peak, of, its, political, and, strategic, power, in, relation, to, the, united, states, as, a, result, of, the, limits, agreed, to, by, both, superpowers, in, the, first, salt, treaty, the, soviet, union, obtained, parity, in, nuclear, weapons, with, the, united, states, for, the, first, time, in, the, cold, war, additionally, as, a, result, of, negotiations, during, the, helsinki, accords, brezhnev, succeeded, in, securing, the, legitimization, of, soviet, hegemony, over, central, and, eastern, europe, under, the, rule, of, nikita, khrushchev, the, soviet, union, initially, supported, north, vietnam, out, of, fraternal, solidarity, however, as, the, war, escalated, khrushchev, urged, the, north, vietnamese, leadership, to, give, up, the, quest, of, liberating, south, vietnam, he, continued, by, rejecting, an, offer, of, assistance, made, by, the, north, vietnamese, government, and, instead, told, them, to, enter, negotiations, in, the, united, nations, security, council, after, khrushchev, s, ousting, brezhnev, resumed, aiding, the, communist, resistance, in, vietnam, in, february, 1965, premier, kosygin, visited, hanoi, with, a, dozen, soviet, air, force, generals, and, economic, experts, over, the, course, of, the, war, brezhnev, s, regime, would, ultimately, ship, 450, million, worth, of, arms, annually, to, north, vietnam, lyndon, b, johnson, privately, suggested, to, brezhnev, that, he, would, guarantee, an, end, to, south, vietnamese, hostility, if, brezhnev, would, guarantee, a, north, vietnamese, one, brezhnev, was, interested, in, this, offer, initially, but, rejected, the, offer, upon, being, told, by, andrei, gromyko, that, the, north, vietnamese, were, not, interested, in, a, diplomatic, solution, to, the, war, the, johnson, administration, responded, to, this, rejection, by, expanding, the, american, presence, in, vietnam, but, later, invited, the, ussr, to, negotiate, a, treaty, concerning, arms, control, the, ussr, did, not, respond, initially, because, of, the, power, struggle, between, brezhnev, and, kosygin, over, which, figure, had, the, right, to, represent, soviet, interests, abroad, and, later, because, of, the, escalation, of, the, dirty, war, in, vietnam, in, early, 1967, johnson, offered, to, make, a, deal, with, ho, chi, minh, and, said, he, was, prepared, to, end, u, s, bombing, raids, in, north, vietnam, if, ho, ended, his, infiltration, of, south, vietnam, the, u, s, bombing, raids, halted, for, a, few, days, and, kosygin, publicly, announced, his, support, for, this, offer, the, north, vietnamese, government, failed, to, respond, and, because, of, this, the, u, s, continued, its, raids, in, north, vietnam, after, this, event, brezhnev, concluded, that, seeking, diplomatic, solutions, to, the, ongoing, war, in, vietnam, was, hopeless, later, in, 1968, johnson, invited, kosygin, to, the, united, states, to, discuss, ongoing, problems, in, vietnam, and, the, arms, race, the, summit, was, marked, by, a, friendly, atmosphere, but, there, were, no, concrete, breakthroughs, by, either, side, in, the, aftermath, of, the, sino, soviet, border, conflict, the, chinese, continued, to, aid, the, north, vietnamese, regime, but, with, the, death, of, ho, chi, minh, in, 1969, china, s, strongest, link, to, north, vietnam, was, gone, in, the, meantime, richard, nixon, had, been, elected, president, of, the, united, states, while, having, been, known, for, his, anti, communist, rhetoric, nixon, said, in, 1971, that, the, u, s, must, have, relations, with, communist, china, his, plan, was, for, a, slow, withdrawal, of, u, s, troops, from, south, vietnam, while, still, retaining, the, government, of, south, vietnam, the, only, way, he, thought, this, was, possible, was, by, improving, relations, with, both, communist, china, and, the, ussr, he, later, made, a, visit, to, moscow, to, negotiate, a, treaty, on, arms, control, and, the, vietnam, war, but, on, vietnam, nothing, could, be, agreed, ultimately, years, of, soviet, military, aid, to, north, vietnam, finally, bore, fruit, when, collapsing, morale, among, u, s, forces, ultimately, compelled, their, complete, withdrawal, from, south, vietnam, by, 1973, thereby, making, way, for, the, country, s, unification, under, communist, rule, two, years, later, soviet, foreign, relations, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, quickly, deteriorated, after, nikita, khrushchev, s, attempts, to, reach, a, rapprochement, with, more, liberal, eastern, european, states, such, as, yugoslavia, and, with, the, west, when, brezhnev, consolidated, his, power, base, in, the, 1960s, china, was, descending, into, crisis, because, of, mao, zedong, s, cultural, revolution, which, led, to, the, decimation, of, the, chinese, communist, party, and, other, ruling, offices, brezhnev, a, pragmatic, politician, who, promoted, the, idea, of, stabilization, could, not, comprehend, why, mao, would, start, such, a, self, destructive, drive, to, finish, the, socialist, revolution, according, to, himself, however, brezhnev, had, problems, of, his, own, in, the, form, of, czechoslovakia, whose, sharp, deviation, from, the, soviet, model, prompted, him, and, the, rest, of, the, warsaw, pact, to, invade, their, eastern, bloc, ally, in, the, aftermath, of, the, soviet, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, involving, the, overthrow, of, the, reformist, government, there, the, soviet, leadership, proclaimed, the, brezhnev, doctrine, any, threat, to, socialist, rule, in, any, state, of, the, soviet, bloc, in, central, and, eastern, europe, was, a, threat, to, all, of, them, and, would, justify, the, intervention, of, fellow, socialist, states, to, forcibly, remove, the, threat, the, references, to, socialism, meant, control, by, the, communist, parties, that, were, loyal, to, the, kremlin, this, new, policy, increased, tension, not, only, with, the, eastern, bloc, but, also, the, asian, communist, states, by, 1969, relations, with, other, communist, countries, had, deteriorated, to, a, level, where, brezhnev, was, not, even, able, to, gather, five, of, the, fourteen, ruling, communist, parties, to, attend, an, international, conference, in, moscow, in, the, aftermath, of, the, failed, conference, the, soviets, concluded, there, was, no, leading, center, of, the, international, communist, movement, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, repudiated, the, brezhnev, doctrine, in, the, late, 1980s, as, the, kremlin, accepted, the, peaceful, overthrow, of, soviet, rule, in, all, its, satellite, countries, in, eastern, europe, later, in, 1969, the, deterioration, in, bilateral, relations, culminated, in, the, sino, soviet, border, conflict, the, sino, soviet, split, had, chagrined, premier, alexei, kosygin, a, great, deal, and, for, a, while, he, refused, to, accept, its, irrevocability, he, briefly, visited, beijing, in, 1969, due, to, the, increase, of, tension, between, the, ussr, and, china, by, the, early, 1980s, both, the, chinese, and, the, soviets, were, issuing, statements, calling, for, a, normalization, of, relations, between, the, two, states, the, conditions, given, to, the, soviets, by, the, chinese, were, the, reduction, of, soviet, military, presence, in, the, sino, soviet, border, the, withdrawal, of, soviet, troops, in, afghanistan, and, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, furthermore, china, also, wanted, the, soviets, to, end, their, support, for, the, vietnamese, invasion, of, cambodia, brezhnev, responded, in, his, march, 1982, speech, in, tashkent, where, he, called, for, the, normalization, of, relations, full, sino, soviet, normalization, of, relations, would, prove, to, take, years, until, the, last, soviet, ruler, mikhail, gorbachev, came, to, power, after, the, communist, revolution, in, afghanistan, in, 1978, authoritarian, actions, forced, upon, the, populace, by, the, communist, regime, led, to, the, afghan, civil, war, with, the, mujahideen, leading, the, popular, backlash, against, the, regime, the, soviet, union, was, worried, that, they, were, losing, their, influence, in, central, asia, so, after, a, kgb, report, claimed, that, afghanistan, could, be, taken, in, a, matter, of, weeks, brezhnev, and, several, top, party, officials, agreed, to, a, full, intervention, contemporary, researchers, tend, to, believe, that, brezhnev, had, been, misinformed, on, the, situation, in, afghanistan, his, health, had, decayed, and, proponents, of, direct, military, intervention, took, over, the, majority, group, in, the, politburo, by, cheating, and, using, falsified, evidence, they, advocated, a, relatively, moderate, scenario, maintaining, a, cadre, of, 1, 500, to, 2, 500, soviet, military, advisers, and, technicians, in, the, country, which, had, already, been, there, in, large, numbers, since, the, 1950s, but, they, disagreed, on, sending, regular, army, units, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, troops, some, believe, that, brezhnev, s, signature, on, the, decree, was, obtained, without, telling, him, the, full, story, otherwise, he, would, have, never, approved, such, a, decision, soviet, ambassador, to, the, u, s, anatoly, dobrynin, believed, that, the, real, mastermind, behind, the, invasion, who, misinformed, brezhnev, was, mikhail, suslov, brezhnev, s, personal, physician, mikhail, kosarev, later, recalled, that, brezhnev, when, he, was, in, his, right, mind, in, fact, resisted, the, full, scale, intervention, deputy, chairman, of, the, state, duma, vladimir, zhirinovsky, stated, officially, that, despite, the, military, solution, being, supported, by, some, hardline, defense, minister, dmitry, ustinov, was, the, only, politburo, member, who, insisted, on, sending, regular, army, units, parts, of, the, soviet, military, establishment, were, opposed, to, any, sort, of, active, soviet, military, presence, in, afghanistan, believing, that, the, soviet, union, should, leave, afghan, politics, alone, the, first, crisis, for, brezhnev, s, regime, came, in, 1968, with, the, attempt, by, the, communist, leadership, in, czechoslovakia, under, alexander, dub, ek, to, liberalize, the, communist, system, prague, spring, in, july, brezhnev, publicly, denounced, the, czechoslovak, leadership, as, revisionist, and, anti, soviet, despite, his, hardline, public, statements, brezhnev, was, not, the, one, pushing, hardest, for, the, use, of, military, force, in, czechoslovakia, when, the, issue, was, before, the, politburo, archival, evidence, suggests, that, brezhnev, was, one, of, the, few, who, was, looking, for, a, temporary, compromise, with, the, reform, friendly, czechoslovak, government, when, their, dispute, came, to, a, head, however, in, the, end, brezhnev, concluded, that, he, would, risk, growing, turmoil, domestically, and, within, the, eastern, bloc, if, he, abstained, or, voted, against, soviet, intervention, in, czechoslovakia, as, pressure, mounted, on, him, within, the, soviet, leadership, to, re, install, a, revolutionary, government, within, prague, brezhnev, ordered, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, and, dub, ek, s, removal, in, august, following, the, soviet, intervention, he, met, with, czechoslovak, reformer, bohumil, simon, then, a, member, of, the, politburo, of, the, czechoslovak, communist, party, and, said, if, i, had, not, voted, for, soviet, armed, assistance, to, czechoslovakia, you, would, not, be, sitting, here, today, but, quite, possibly, i, wouldn, t, either, however, contrary, to, the, stabilizing, effect, envisioned, by, moscow, the, invasion, served, as, a, catalyst, for, further, dissent, in, the, eastern, bloc, in, the, aftermath, of, the, prague, spring, s, suppression, brezhnev, announced, that, the, soviet, union, had, the, right, to, interfere, in, the, internal, affairs, of, its, satellites, to, safeguard, socialism, this, became, known, as, the, brezhnev, doctrine, although, it, was, really, a, restatement, of, existing, soviet, policy, as, enacted, by, khrushchev, in, hungary, in, 1956, brezhnev, reiterated, the, doctrine, in, a, speech, at, the, fifth, congress, of, the, polish, united, workers, party, on, 13, november, 1968, when, forces, that, are, hostile, to, socialism, try, to, turn, the, development, of, some, socialist, country, towards, capitalism, it, becomes, not, only, a, problem, of, the, country, concerned, but, a, common, problem, and, concern, of, all, socialist, countries, later, in, 1980, a, political, crisis, emerged, in, poland, with, the, emergence, of, the, solidarity, movement, by, the, end, of, october, solidarity, had, 3, million, members, and, by, december, had, 9, million, in, a, public, opinion, poll, organised, by, the, polish, government, 89, of, the, respondents, supported, solidarity, with, the, polish, leadership, split, on, what, to, do, the, majority, did, not, want, to, impose, martial, law, as, suggested, by, wojciech, jaruzelski, the, soviet, union, and, other, states, of, the, eastern, bloc, were, unsure, how, to, handle, the, situation, but, erich, honecker, of, east, germany, pressed, for, military, action, in, a, formal, letter, to, brezhnev, honecker, proposed, a, joint, military, measure, to, control, the, escalating, problems, in, poland, a, cia, report, suggested, the, soviet, military, were, mobilizing, for, an, invasion, in, 1980, 81, representatives, from, the, eastern, bloc, nations, met, at, the, kremlin, to, discuss, the, polish, situation, brezhnev, eventually, concluded, on, 10, december, 1981, that, it, would, be, better, to, leave, the, domestic, matters, of, poland, alone, reassuring, the, polish, delegates, that, the, ussr, would, intervene, only, if, asked, to, this, effectively, marked, the, end, of, the, brezhnev, doctrine, notwithstanding, the, absence, of, a, soviet, military, intervention, wojciech, jaruzelski, ultimately, gave, in, to, moscow, s, demands, by, imposing, a, state, of, war, the, polish, version, of, martial, law, on, 13, december, 1981, the, last, years, of, brezhnev, s, rule, were, marked, by, a, growing, personality, cult, his, love, of, medals, he, received, over, 100, was, well, known, so, in, december, 1966, on, his, 60th, birthday, he, was, awarded, the, hero, of, the, soviet, union, brezhnev, received, the, award, which, came, with, the, order, of, lenin, and, the, gold, star, three, more, times, in, celebration, of, his, birthdays, on, his, 70th, birthday, he, was, awarded, the, rank, of, marshal, of, the, soviet, union, the, soviet, union, s, highest, military, honour, after, being, awarded, the, rank, he, attended, an, 18th, army, veterans, meeting, dressed, in, a, long, coat, and, saying, attention, the, marshal, is, coming, he, also, conferred, upon, himself, the, rare, order, of, victory, in, 1978, which, was, posthumously, revoked, in, 1989, for, not, meeting, the, criteria, for, citation, a, promotion, to, the, rank, of, generalissimo, of, the, soviet, union, planned, for, brezhnev, s, seventy, fifth, birthday, was, quietly, shelved, due, to, his, ongoing, health, problems, brezhnev, s, eagerness, for, undeserved, glory, was, shown, by, his, poorly, written, memoirs, recalling, his, military, service, during, world, war, ii, which, treated, the, minor, battles, near, novorossiysk, as, a, decisive, military, theatre, despite, his, book, s, apparent, weaknesses, it, was, awarded, the, lenin, prize, for, literature, and, was, hailed, by, the, soviet, press, the, book, was, followed, by, two, other, books, one, on, the, virgin, lands, campaign, brezhnev, s, personality, cult, was, growing, at, a, time, when, his, health, was, in, rapid, decline, his, physical, condition, was, deteriorating, he, had, been, a, heavy, smoker, until, the, 1970s, had, become, addicted, to, sleeping, pills, and, tranquilizers, and, had, begun, drinking, to, excess, his, niece, lyubov, brezhneva, attributed, his, dependencies, and, overall, decline, to, severe, depression, caused, by, in, addition, to, the, stress, of, his, job, and, the, general, situation, of, the, country, an, extremely, unhappy, family, life, with, near, daily, conflicts, with, his, wife, and, children, in, particular, his, troubled, daughter, galina, whose, erratic, behavior, failed, marriages, and, involvement, in, corruption, took, a, heavy, toll, on, brezhnev, s, mental, and, physical, health, brezhnev, had, considered, divorcing, his, wife, and, disowning, his, children, many, times, but, intervention, from, his, extended, family, and, the, politburo, fearing, negative, publicity, managed, to, dissuade, him, over, the, years, he, had, become, overweight, from, 1973, until, his, death, brezhnev, s, central, nervous, system, underwent, chronic, deterioration, and, he, had, several, minor, strokes, as, well, as, insomnia, in, 1975, he, suffered, his, first, heart, attack, when, receiving, the, order, of, lenin, brezhnev, walked, shakily, and, fumbled, his, words, according, to, one, american, intelligence, expert, united, states, officials, knew, for, several, years, that, brezhnev, had, suffered, from, severe, arteriosclerosis, and, believed, he, had, suffered, from, other, unspecified, ailments, as, well, in, 1977, american, intelligence, officials, publicly, suggested, that, brezhnev, had, also, been, suffering, from, gout, leukemia, and, emphysema, from, decades, of, heavy, smoking, as, well, as, chronic, bronchitis, he, was, reported, to, have, been, fitted, with, a, pacemaker, to, control, his, heart, rhythm, abnormalities, on, occasion, he, was, known, to, have, suffered, from, memory, loss, speaking, problems, and, had, difficulties, with, coordination, according, to, the, washington, post, all, of, this, is, also, reported, to, be, taking, its, toll, on, brezhnev, s, mood, he, is, said, to, be, depressed, despondent, over, his, own, failing, health, and, discouraged, by, the, death, of, many, of, his, long, time, colleagues, to, help, he, has, turned, to, regular, counseling, and, hypnosis, by, an, assyrian, woman, a, sort, of, modern, day, rasputin, upon, suffering, a, stroke, in, 1975, brezhnev, s, ability, to, lead, the, soviet, union, was, significantly, compromised, as, his, ability, to, define, soviet, foreign, policy, weakened, he, increasingly, deferred, to, the, opinions, of, a, hardline, brain, trust, comprising, kgb, chairman, yuri, andropov, longtime, foreign, minister, andrei, gromyko, and, defense, minister, andrei, grechko, who, was, succeeded, by, dmitriy, ustinov, in, 1976, the, ministry, of, health, kept, doctors, by, brezhnev, s, side, at, all, times, and, he, was, brought, back, from, near, death, on, several, occasions, at, this, time, most, senior, officers, of, the, cpsu, wanted, to, keep, brezhnev, alive, even, though, an, increasing, number, of, officials, were, frustrated, with, his, policies, no, one, in, the, regime, wanted, to, risk, a, new, period, of, domestic, turmoil, which, might, be, caused, by, his, death, western, commentators, started, guessing, who, brezhnev, s, heir, apparent, was, the, most, notable, candidates, were, mikhail, suslov, and, andrei, kirilenko, who, were, both, older, than, brezhnev, and, fyodor, kulakov, and, konstantin, chernenko, who, were, younger, kulakov, died, of, natural, causes, in, 1978, brezhnev, s, health, worsened, in, the, winter, of, 1981, 82, while, the, politburo, was, pondering, the, question, of, who, would, succeed, all, signs, indicated, that, the, ailing, leader, was, dying, the, choice, of, the, successor, would, have, been, influenced, by, suslov, but, he, died, at, the, age, of, 79, in, january, 1982, andropov, took, suslov, s, seat, in, the, central, committee, secretariat, by, may, it, became, obvious, that, andropov, would, make, a, bid, for, the, office, of, the, general, secretary, with, the, help, of, fellow, kgb, associates, he, started, circulating, rumors, that, political, corruption, had, become, worse, during, brezhnev, s, tenure, as, leader, in, an, attempt, to, create, an, environment, hostile, to, brezhnev, in, the, politburo, andropov, s, actions, showed, that, he, was, not, afraid, of, brezhnev, s, wrath, in, march, 1982, brezhnev, received, a, concussion, and, fractured, his, right, clavicle, while, touring, a, factory, in, tashkent, after, a, metal, balustrade, collapsed, under, the, weight, of, a, number, of, factory, workers, falling, on, top, of, brezhnev, and, his, security, detail, this, incident, was, reported, in, western, media, as, brezhnev, having, suffered, a, stroke, after, a, month, long, recovery, brezhnev, worked, intermittently, through, november, on, 7, november, 1982, he, was, present, standing, on, the, lenin, mausoleum, s, balcony, during, the, annual, military, parade, and, demonstration, of, workers, commemorating, the, 65th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, the, event, marked, brezhnev, s, final, public, appearance, before, dying, three, days, later, after, suffering, a, heart, attack, he, was, honored, with, a, state, funeral, after, a, three, day, period, of, nationwide, mourning, he, was, buried, in, the, kremlin, wall, necropolis, in, red, square, in, one, of, the, twelve, individual, tombs, located, between,

uniform, along, with, his, medals, brezhnev, presided, over, the, soviet, union, for, longer, than, any, other, person, except, joseph, stalin, he, is, remembered, for, donning, the, mantle, of, a, peacemaker, and, a, common, sense, statesman, he, is, often, criticised, for, the, prolonged, era, of, stagnation, in, which, fundamental, economic, problems, were, ignored, and, the, soviet, political, system, was, allowed, to, decline, during, mikhail, gorbachev, s, tenure, as, leader, there, was, an, increase, in, criticism, of, the, brezhnev, years, such, as, claims, that, brezhnev, followed, a, fierce, neo, stalinist, line, the, gorbachevian, discourse, blamed, brezhnev, for, failing, to, modernize, the, country, and, to, change, with, the, times, although, in, a, later, statement, gorbachev, made, assurances, that, brezhnev, was, not, as, bad, as, he, was, made, out, to, be, saying, brezhnev, was, nothing, like, the, cartoon, figure, that, is, made, of, him, now, the, intervention, in, afghanistan, which, was, one, of, the, major, decisions, of, his, career, also, significantly, undermined, both, the, international, standing, and, the, internal, strength, of, the, soviet, union, in, brezhnev, s, defense, it, can, be, said, that, the, soviet, union, reached, unprecedented, and, never, repeated, levels, of, power, prestige, and, internal, calm, under, his, rule, brezhnev, fared, better, when, compared, to, his, successors, and, predecessors, in, russia, in, a, 1999, poll, he, ranked, as, the, best, russian, leader, of, the, 20th, century, in, an, opinion, poll, by, vtsiom, in, 2007, the, majority, of, russians, chose, to, live, during, the, brezhnev, era, rather, than, any, other, period, of, 20th, century, soviet, history, in, a, levada, center, poll, conducted, in, 2013, brezhnev, beat, vladimir, lenin, as, russia, s, favorite, leader, in, the, 20th, century, with, 56, approval, in, another, poll, in, 2013, brezhnev, was, voted, the, best, russian, leader, of, the, 20th, century, in, a, 2018, rating, sociological, group, poll, 47, of, ukrainian, respondents, had, a, positive, opinion, of, brezhnev, in, the, west, stagnation, hypothesis, is, generally, accepted, with, regards, to, the, rule, of, brezhnev, russian, historian, roy, medvedev, emphasizes, the, bureaucratic, mentality, and, personality, strengths, that, enabled, brezhnev, to, gain, power, he, was, loyal, to, his, friends, vain, in, desiring, ceremonial, power, and, refused, to, control, corruption, inside, the, party, especially, in, foreign, affairs, brezhnev, increasingly, took, all, major, decisions, into, his, own, hands, without, telling, his, colleagues, in, the, politburo, he, deliberately, presented, a, different, persona, to, different, people, culminating, in, the, systematic, glorification, of, his, own, career, brezhnev, s, vanity, made, him, the, target, of, many, political, jokes, nikolai, podgorny, warned, him, of, this, but, brezhnev, replied, if, they, are, poking, fun, at, me, it, means, they, like, me, in, keeping, with, traditional, socialist, greetings, brezhnev, kissed, many, politicians, on, the, lips, during, his, career, one, of, these, occasions, with, erich, honecker, was, the, subject, of, my, god, help, me, to, survive, this, deadly, love, a, mural, painted, on, the, berlin, wall, after, its, opening, and, dismantlement, brezhnev, s, main, passion, was, driving, foreign, cars, given, to, him, by, leaders, of, state, from, across, the, world, he, usually, drove, these, between, his, dacha, and, the, kremlin, with, according, to, historian, robert, service, flagrant, disregard, for, public, safety, when, visiting, the, united, states, for, a, summit, with, richard, nixon, in, 1973, he, expressed, a, wish, to, drive, around, washington, in, a, lincoln, continental, that, nixon, had, just, given, him, upon, being, told, that, the, secret, service, would, not, allow, him, to, do, this, he, said, i, will, take, the, flag, off, the, car, put, on, dark, glasses, so, they, can, t, see, my, eyebrows, and, drive, like, any, american, would, to, which, henry, kissinger, replied, i, have,
