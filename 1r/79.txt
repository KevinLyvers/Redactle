1917, following, the, collapse, of, the, florida, film, industry, hardy, and, his, wife, madelyn, moved, to, california, to, seek, new, opportunities, hal, roach, recounted, how, laurel, and, hardy, became, a, team, hardy, was, already, working, for, roach, and, others, when, roach, hired, laurel, whom, he, had, seen, in, vaudeville, laurel, had, very, light, blue, eyes, and, roach, discovered, that, due, to, the, technology, of, film, at, that, time, laurel, s, eyes, would, not, photograph, properly, blue, photographed, as, white, this, problem, is, apparent, in, their, first, silent, film, together, the, lucky, dog, where, an, attempt, was, made, to, compensate, for, the, problem, by, applying, heavy, makeup, to, laurel, s, eyes, for, about, a, year, roach, had, laurel, work, at, the, studio, as, a, writer, then, panchromatic, film, was, developed, they, tested, laurel, and, found, the, problem, was, solved, laurel, and, hardy, were, then, put, together, in, a, film, and, they, seemed, to, complement, each, other, comedy, teams, were, usually, composed, of, a, straight, man, and, a, funny, man, but, these, two, were, both, comedians, however, each, knew, how, to, play, the, straight, man, when, the, script, required, it, roach, said, you, could, always, cut, to, a, close, up, of, either, one, and, their, reaction, was, good, for, another, laugh, the, humor, of, laurel, and, hardy, was, highly, visual, with, slapstick, used, for, emphasis, they, often, had, physical, arguments, in, character, which, were, quite, complex, and, involved, a, cartoonish, style, of, violence, their, ineptitude, and, misfortune, precluded, them, from, making, any, real, progress, even, in, the, simplest, endeavors, much, of, their, comedy, involves, milking, a, joke, where, a, simple, idea, provides, a, basis, for, multiple, ongoing, gags, without, following, a, defined, narrative, stan, laurel, was, of, average, height, and, weight, but, appeared, comparatively, small, and, slight, next, to, oliver, hardy, who, was, 6, ft, 1, in, 185, cm, and, weighed, about, 280, lb, 127, kg, 20, st, 0, lb, in, his, prime, details, of, their, hair, and, clothing, were, used, to, enhance, this, natural, contrast, laurel, kept, his, hair, short, on, the, sides, and, back, growing, it, long, on, top, to, create, a, natural, fright, wig, typically, at, times, of, shock, he, simultaneously, screwed, up, his, face, to, appear, as, if, crying, while, pulling, up, his, hair, in, contrast, hardy, s, thinning, hair, was, pasted, on, his, forehead, in, spit, curls, and, he, sported, a, toothbrush, moustache, to, achieve, a, flat, footed, walk, laurel, removed, the, heels, from, his, shoes, both, wore, bowler, hats, with, laurel, s, being, narrower, than, hardy, s, and, with, a, flattened, brim, the, characters, normal, attire, called, for, wing, collar, shirts, with, hardy, wearing, a, necktie, which, he, would, twiddle, when, he, was, particularly, self, conscious, and, laurel, a, bow, tie, hardy, s, sports, jacket, was, a, little, small, and, done, up, with, one, straining, button, whereas, laurel, s, double, breasted, jacket, was, loose, fitting, a, popular, routine, was, a, tit, for, tat, fight, with, an, adversary, it, could, be, with, their, wives, often, played, by, mae, busch, anita, garvin, or, daphne, pollard, or, with, a, neighbor, often, played, by, charlie, hall, or, james, finlayson, laurel, and, hardy, would, accidentally, damage, someone, s, property, and, the, injured, party, would, retaliate, by, ruining, something, belonging, to, laurel, or, hardy, after, calmly, surveying, the, damage, one, or, the, other, of, the, offended, parties, found, something, else, to, vandalize, and, the, conflict, escalated, until, both, sides, were, simultaneously, destroying, items, in, front, of, each, other, an, early, example, of, the, routine, occurs, in, their, classic, short, big, business, 1929, which, was, added, to, the, national, film, registry, in, 1992, another, short, film, which, revolves, around, such, an, altercation, was, titled, tit, for, tat, 1935, one, of, their, best, remembered, dialogue, devices, was, the, tell, me, that, again, routine, laurel, would, tell, hardy, a, genuinely, smart, idea, he, came, up, with, and, hardy, would, reply, tell, me, that, again, laurel, would, then, try, to, repeat, the, idea, but, having, instantly, forgotten, it, babble, utter, nonsense, hardy, who, had, difficulty, understanding, laurel, s, idea, when, expressed, clearly, would, then, understand, the, jumbled, version, perfectly, while, much, of, their, comedy, remained, visual, humorous, dialogue, often, occurred, in, laurel, and, hardy, s, talking, films, as, well, examples, include, in, some, cases, their, comedy, bordered, on, the, surreal, in, a, style, laurel, called, white, magic, for, example, in, the, 1937, film, way, out, west, laurel, flicks, his, thumb, upward, as, if, working, a, lighter, his, thumb, ignites, and, he, matter, of, factly, lights, hardy, s, pipe, amazed, at, seeing, this, hardy, unsuccessfully, attempts, to, duplicate, it, throughout, the, film, much, later, he, finally, succeeds, only, to, be, terrified, when, his, thumb, catches, fire, laurel, expands, the, joke, in, the, 1938, film, block, heads, by, pouring, tobacco, into, his, clenched, fist, and, smoking, it, as, though, it, were, a, pipe, again, to, hardy, s, bemusement, this, time, the, joke, ends, when, a, match, laurel, was, using, relights, itself, hardy, throws, it, into, the, fireplace, and, it, explodes, with, a, loud, bang, rather, than, showing, hardy, suffering, the, pain, of, misfortunes, such, as, falling, down, stairs, or, being, beaten, by, a, thug, banging, and, crashing, sound, effects, were, often, used, so, the, audience, could, visualize, the, mayhem, the, 1927, film, sailors, beware, was, a, significant, one, for, hardy, because, two, of, his, enduring, trademarks, were, developed, the, first, was, his, tie, twiddle, to, demonstrate, embarrassment, hardy, while, acting, had, received, a, pail, of, water, in, the, face, he, said, i, had, been, expecting, it, but, i, didn, t, expect, it, at, that, particular, moment, it, threw, me, mentally, and, i, couldn, t, think, what, to, do, next, so, i, waved, the, tie, in, a, kind, of, tiddly, widdly, fashion, to, show, embarrassment, while, trying, to, look, friendly, his, second, trademark, was, the, camera, look, where, he, breaks, the, fourth, wall, and, in, frustration, stares, directly, at, the, audience, hardy, said, i, had, to, become, exasperated, so, i, just, stared, right, into, the, camera, and, registered, my, disgust, offscreen, laurel, and, hardy, were, quite, the, opposite, of, their, movie, characters, laurel, was, the, industrious, idea, man, while, hardy, was, more, easygoing, laurel, and, hardy, s, best, known, catchphrase, is, well, here, s, another, nice, mess, you, ve, gotten, me, into, it, was, earlier, used, by, w, s, gilbert, in, both, the, mikado, 1885, and, the, grand, duke, 1896, it, was, first, used, by, hardy, in, the, laurel, hardy, murder, case, in, 1930, in, popular, culture, the, catchphrase, is, often, misquoted, as, well, here, s, another, fine, mess, you, ve, gotten, me, into, which, was, never, spoken, by, hardy, a, misunderstanding, that, stems, from, the, title, of, their, film, another, fine, mess, when, hardy, said, the, phrase, laurel, s, frequent, iconic, response, was, to, start, to, cry, pull, his, hair, up, exclaim, well, i, couldn, t, help, it, then, whimper, and, speak, gibberish, some, variations, on, the, phrase, occurred, for, example, in, chickens, come, home, ollie, impatiently, says, to, stan, well, and, stan, continues, for, him, here, s, another, nice, mess, i, ve, gotten, you, into, the, films, thicker, than, water, and, the, fixer, uppers, use, the, phrase, well, here, s, another, nice, kettle, of, fish, you, ve, pickled, me, in, in, saps, at, sea, the, phrase, becomes, well, here, s, another, nice, bucket, of, suds, you, ve, gotten, me, into, the, catchphrase, in, its, original, form, was, used, as, the, last, line, of, dialogue, in, the, duo, s, last, film, atoll, k, 1951, in, moments, of, particular, distress, or, frustration, hardy, often, exclaims, why, don, t, you, do, something, to, help, me, as, laurel, stands, helplessly, by, oh, or, drawn, out, as, ohhhhh, oh, was, another, catchphrase, used, by, hardy, he, uses, the, expression, in, the, duo, s, first, sound, film, unaccustomed, as, we, are, 1929, when, his, character, s, wife, smashes, a, record, over, his, head, mustachioed, scottish, actor, james, finlayson, who, appeared, in, 33, laurel, and, hardy, films, used, a, variation, d, oh, the, phrase, expressing, surprise, impatience, or, incredulity, inspired, the, trademark, d, oh, of, character, homer, simpson, voiced, by, dan, castellaneta, in, the, long, running, animated, comedy, the, simpsons, laurel, s, and, hardy, s, first, film, pairing, although, as, separate, performers, was, in, the, silent, the, lucky, dog, its, production, details, have, not, survived, but, film, historian, bo, berglund, has, placed, it, between, september, 1920, and, january, 1921, according, to, interviews, they, gave, in, the, 1930s, the, pair, s, acquaintance, at, the, time, was, casual, and, both, had, forgotten, their, initial, film, entirely, the, plot, sees, laurel, s, character, befriended, by, a, stray, dog, which, after, some, lucky, escapes, saves, him, from, being, blown, up, by, dynamite, hardy, s, character, is, a, mugger, attempting, to, rob, laurel, they, later, signed, separate, contracts, with, the, hal, roach, studios, and, next, appeared, in, the, 1926, film, 45, minutes, from, hollywood, hal, roach, is, considered, the, most, important, person, in, the, development, of, laurel, s, and, hardy, s, film, careers, he, brought, them, together, and, they, worked, for, roach, for, almost, 20, years, director, charley, rogers, who, worked, closely, with, the, three, men, for, many, years, said, it, could, not, have, happened, if, laurel, hardy, and, roach, had, not, met, at, the, right, place, and, the, right, time, their, first, official, film, together, was, putting, pants, on, philip, released, december, 3, 1927, the, plot, involves, laurel, as, philip, a, young, scotsman, who, arrives, in, the, united, states, in, full, kilted, splendor, and, suffers, mishaps, involving, the, kilts, his, uncle, played, by, hardy, tries, to, put, trousers, on, him, also, in, 1927, the, pair, starred, in, the, battle, of, the, century, a, classic, pie, throwing, short, involving, over, 3, 000, real, pies, only, a, fragment, of, the, film, was, known, to, exist, until, the, first, half, resurfaced, in, the, 1970s, a, more, complete, print, was, discovered, in, 2015, by, historian, jon, mirsalis, laurel, said, to, the, duo, s, biographer, john, mccabe, of, all, the, questions, we, re, asked, the, most, frequent, is, how, did, we, come, together, i, always, explain, that, we, came, together, naturally, laurel, and, hardy, were, joined, by, accident, and, grew, by, indirection, in, 1926, both, were, part, of, the, roach, comedy, all, stars, a, stock, company, of, actors, who, took, part, in, a, series, of, films, laurel, s, and, hardy, s, parts, gradually, grew, larger, while, those, of, their, fellow, stars, diminished, because, laurel, and, hardy, had, superior, pantomime, skills, their, teaming, was, suggested, by, leo, mccarey, their, supervising, director, from, 1927, and, 1930, during, that, period, mccarey, and, laurel, jointly, devised, the, team, s, format, mccarey, also, influenced, the, slowing, of, their, comedy, action, from, the, silent, era, s, typically, frantic, pace, to, a, more, natural, one, the, formula, worked, so, well, that, laurel, and, hardy, played, the, same, characters, for, the, next, 30, years, although, roach, employed, writers, and, directors, such, as, h, m, walker, leo, mccarey, james, parrott, and, james, w, horne, on, the, laurel, and, hardy, films, laurel, who, had, a, considerable, background, in, comedy, writing, often, rewrote, entire, sequences, and, scripts, he, also, encouraged, the, cast, and, crew, to, improvise, then, meticulously, reviewed, the, footage, during, editing, by, 1929, he, was, the, pair, s, head, writer, and, it, was, reported, that, the, writing, sessions, were, gleefully, chaotic, stan, had, three, or, four, writers, who, competed, with, him, in, a, perpetual, game, of, can, you, top, this, hardy, was, quite, happy, to, leave, the, writing, to, his, partner, he, said, after, all, just, doing, the, gags, was, hard, enough, work, especially, if, you, have, taken, as, many, falls, and, been, dumped, in, as, many, mudholes, as, i, have, i, think, i, earned, my, money, laurel, eventually, became, so, involved, in, their, films, productions, many, film, historians, and, aficionados, consider, him, an, uncredited, director, he, ran, the, laurel, and, hardy, set, no, matter, who, was, in, the, director, s, chair, but, never, asserted, his, authority, roach, remarked, laurel, bossed, the, production, with, any, director, if, laurel, said, i, don, t, like, this, idea, the, director, didn, t, say, well, you, re, going, to, do, it, anyway, that, was, understood, as, laurel, made, so, many, suggestions, there, was, not, much, left, for, the, credited, director, to, do, their, 1929, silent, big, business, is, by, far, the, most, critically, acclaimed, laurel, and, hardy, are, christmas, tree, salesmen, who, are, drawn, into, a, classic, tit, for, tat, battle, with, a, character, played, by, james, finlayson, that, eventually, destroys, his, house, and, their, car, big, business, was, added, to, the, united, states, national, film, registry, as, a, national, treasure, in, 1992, in, 1929, the, silent, era, of, film, was, coming, to, an, end, many, silent, film, actors, failed, to, make, the, transition, to, talkies, some, because, they, felt, sound, was, irrelevant, to, their, craft, of, conveying, stories, with, body, language, and, others, because, their, spoken, voices, were, considered, inadequate, for, the, new, medium, however, the, addition, of, spoken, dialogue, only, enhanced, laurel, s, and, hardy, s, performances, both, had, extensive, theatrical, experience, and, could, use, their, voices, to, great, comic, effect, their, films, also, continued, to, feature, much, visual, comedy, in, these, ways, they, made, a, seamless, transition, to, their, first, sound, film, unaccustomed, as, we, are, 1929, whose, title, was, a, play, on, the, familiar, phrase, unaccustomed, as, i, am, to, public, speaking, in, the, opening, dialogue, laurel, and, hardy, began, by, spoofing, the, slow, and, self, conscious, speech, of, the, early, talking, actors, which, became, a, routine, they, would, use, regularly, the, music, box, 1932, with, the, pair, delivering, a, piano, up, a, long, flight, of, steps, won, an, academy, award, for, best, live, action, short, subject, the, music, box, remains, one, of, the, duo, s, most, widely, known, films, laurel, and, hardy, were, favorites, around, the, world, and, hal, roach, catered, to, international, audiences, by, filming, many, of, their, early, talkies, in, other, languages, they, spoke, their, dialogue, phonetically, in, spanish, italian, french, or, german, the, plots, remained, similar, to, the, english, versions, although, the, supporting, actors, were, often, changed, to, those, who, were, fluent, in, the, native, language, pardon, us, 1931, was, reshot, in, all, four, foreign, languages, blotto, hog, wild, and, be, big, were, remade, in, french, and, spanish, versions, night, owls, was, remade, in, both, spanish, and, italian, and, below, zero, and, chickens, come, home, in, spanish, just, as, laurel, and, hardy, s, teaming, was, accidental, so, was, their, entry, into, the, field, of, feature, films, in, the, words, of, biographer, john, mccabe, roach, planned, to, use, the, mgm, set, for, a, simple, prison, break, two, reeler, but, mgm, suddenly, added, a, proviso, laurel, and, hardy, would, have, to, do, a, picture, for, them, in, exchange, roach, would, not, agree, so, he, built, his, own, prison, set, a, very, expensive, item, for, a, two, reeler, so, expensive, was, it, indeed, that, he, added, four, more, reels, to, bring, it, into, the, feature, category, and, it, was, hoped, the, bigger, market, the, experiment, was, successful, and, the, team, continued, to, make, features, along, with, their, established, short, subjects, until, 1935, when, they, converted, to, features,
