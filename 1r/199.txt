for, the, first, time, i, made, good, marks, this, was, almost, my, undoing, because, after, i, had, garnered, statistically, a, certain, number, of, credits, i, became, the, property, of, barnard, college, at, columbia, and, once, i, was, the, property, of, barnard, i, had, to, take, it, seemed, what, barnard, wanted, me, to, take, not, what, i, wanted, to, learn, fortunately, my, high, school, marks, had, been, so, bad, that, barnard, decided, i, could, not, belong, to, it, and, i, was, therefore, allowed, to, continue, getting, an, education, after, attending, columbia, university, s,

a, garden, in, the, backyard, working, for, the, state, department, during, the, mccarthy, era, jacobs, received, a, questionnaire, about, her, political, beliefs, and, loyalties, jacobs, was, anti, communist, and, had, left, the, federal, workers, union, because, of, its, apparent, communist, sympathies, nevertheless, she, was, pro, union, and, purportedly, appreciated, the, writing, of, saul, alinsky, and, therefore, she, was, under, suspicion, on, 25, march, 1952, jacobs, delivered, her, response, to, conrad, e, snow, chairman, of, the, loyalty, security, board, at, the, us, department, of, state, in, her, foreword, to, her, answer, she, said, the, other, threat, to, the, security, of, our, tradition, i, believe, lies, at, home, it, is, the, current, fear, of, radical, ideas, and, of, people, who, propound, them, i, do, not, agree, with, the, extremists, of, either, the, left, or, the, right, but, i, think, they, should, be, allowed, to, speak, and, to, publish, both, because, they, themselves, have, and, ought, to, have, rights, and, once, their, rights, are, gone, the, rights, of, the, rest, of, us, are, hardly, safe, jacobs, left, amerika, in, 1952, when, it, announced,

by, edmund, bacon, although, her, editors, expected, a, positive, story, jacobs, criticized, bacon, s, project, reacting, against, its, lack, of, concern, for, the, poor, african, americans, who, were, directly, affected, when, bacon, showed, jacobs, examples, of, undeveloped, and, developed, blocks, she, determined, that, development, seemed, to, end, community, life, on, the, street, when, jacobs, returned, to, the, offices, of, architectural, forum, she, began, to, question, the, 1950s, consensus, on, urban, planning, in, 1955, jacobs, met, william, kirk, an, episcopal, minister, who, worked, in, east, harlem, kirk, came, to, the, architectural, forum, offices, to, describe, the, impact, that, revitalization, had, on, east, harlem, and, he, introduced, jacobs, to, the, neighborhood, in, 1956, while, standing, in, for, douglas, haskell, of, architectural, forum, jacobs, delivered, a, lecture, at, harvard, university, she, addressed, leading, architects, urban, planners, and, intellectuals, including, lewis, mumford, speaking, on, the, topic, of, east, harlem, she, urged, this, audience, to, respect, in, the, deepest, sense, strips, of, chaos, that, have, a, weird, wisdom, of, their, own, not, yet, encompassed, in, our, concept, of, urban, order, contrary, to, her, expectations, the, talk, was, received, with, enthusiasm, but, it, also, marked, her, as, a, threat, to, established, urban, planners, real, estate, owners, and, developers, architectural, forum, printed, the, speech, that, year, along, with, photographs, of, east, harlem, after, reading, her, harvard, speech, william, h, whyte, invited, jacobs, to, write, an, article, for, fortune, magazine, the, resulting, piece, downtown, is, for, people, appeared, in, a, 1958, issue, of, fortune, and, marked, her, first, public, criticism, of, robert, moses, her, criticism, of, the, lincoln, center, was, not, popular, with, supporters, of, urban, renewal, at, architectural, forum, and, fortune, c, d, jackson, the, publisher, of, fortune, was, outraged, and, over, the, telephone, demanded, of, whyte, who, is, this, crazy, dame, the, fortune, article, brought, jacobs, to, the, attention, of, chadbourne, gilpatric, then, associate, director, of, the, humanities, division, at, the, rockefeller, foundation, the, foundation, had, moved, aggressively, into, urban, topics, with, a, recent, award, to, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, for, studies, of, urban, aesthetics, that, would, culminate, in, the, publication, of, kevin, a, lynch, s, image, of, the, city, in, may, 1958, gilpatric, invited, jacobs, to, begin, serving, as, a, reviewer, for, grant, proposals, later, that, year, the, rockefeller, foundation, awarded, a, grant, to, jacobs, to, produce, a, critical, study, of, city, planning, and, urban, life, in, the, us, from, the, mid, 1950s, to, the, mid, 1960s, the, foundation, s, humanities, division, sponsored, an, urban, design, studies, research, program, of, which, jacobs, was, the, best, known, grantee, gilpatric, encouraged, jacobs, to, explor, the, field, of, urban, design, to, look, for, ideas, and, actions, which, may, improve, thinking, on, how, the, design, of, cities, might, better, serve, urban, life, including, cultural, and, humane, value, affiliating, with, the, new, school, then, called, the, new, school, for, social, research, she, spent, three, years, conducting, research, and, writing, drafts, in, 1961, random, house, published, the, result, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, remains, one, of, the, most, influential, books, in, the, history, of, american, city, planning, she, coined, the, terms, mixed, primary, uses, and, eyes, on, the, street, which, were, adopted, professionally, in, urban, design, sociology, and, many, other, fields, jacobs, painted, a, devastating, picture, of, the, profession, of, city, planning, labeling, it, a, pseudoscience, this, angered, the, male, dominated, urban, planning, profession, jacobs, was, criticized, with, ad, hominem, attacks, being, called, a, militant, dame, and, a, housewife, an, amateur, who, had, no, right, to, interfere, with, an, established, discipline, one, planner, dismissed, jacobs, s, book, as, bitter, coffee, house, rambling, robert, moses, sent, a, copy, called, it, intemperate, and, also, libelous, sell, this, junk, to, someone, else, later, her, book, was, criticized, from, the, left, for, leaving, out, race, and, openly, endorsing, gentrification, which, jacobs, referred, to, as, unslumming, in, 1962, she, resigned, her, position, at, architectural, forum, to, become, a, full, time, author, and, concentrate, on, raising, her, children, in, other, political, activities, she, became, an, opponent, of, the, vietnam, war, marched, on, the, pentagon, in, october, 1967, and, criticized, the, construction, of, the, world, trade, center, as, a, disaster, for, manhattan, s, waterfront, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, her, home, neighborhood, of, greenwich, village, was, being, transformed, by, city, and, state, efforts, to, build, housing, see, for, example, jacobs, s, 1961, fight, to, build, the, west, village, houses, in, lieu, of, large, apartment, houses, private, developers, the, expansion, of, new, york, university, and, by, the, urban, renewal, plans, of, robert, moses, moses, plan, funded, as, slum, clearance, by, title, i, of, the, housing, act, of, 1949, also, called, for, several, blocks, to, be, razed, and, replaced, with, upscale, high, rises, the, plan, forced, 132, families, out, of, their, homes, and, displaced, 1, 000, small, businesses, the, result, was, washington, square, village, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, revitalize, the, area, moses, had, proposed, the, extension, of, fifth, avenue, through, washington, square, park, in, 1935, in, the, face, of, community, opposition, moses, had, shelved, the, project, but, revived, the, idea, in, the, 1950s, moses, argued, that, the, fifth, avenue, extension, would, improve, the, flow, of, traffic, through, the, neighborhood, and, provide, access, to, the, planned, lower, manhattan, expressway, lomex, which, would, connect, the, manhattan, bridge, and, williamsburg, bridge, with, the, holland, tunnel, in, response, local, activist, shirley, hayes, created, the, committee, to, save, washington, square, park, a, coalition, of, dozens, of, local, neighborhood, groups, that, opposed, the, roadway, extension, raymond, s, rubinow, eventually, took, over, the, organization, changing, its, name, to, the, joint, emergency, committee, to, close, washington, square, to, traffic, jacob, recruited, to, the, cause, by, gerard, la, mountain, a, local, catholic, priest, whose, church, was, in, the, path, of, the, planned, lomex, route, had, joined, the, committee, under, hayes, but, she, took, a, more, prominent, role, under, rubinow, reaching, out, to, media, outlets, such, as, the, village, voice, which, provided, more, sympathetic, coverage, than, the, new, york, times, the, committee, gained, the, support, of, margaret, mead, eleanor, roosevelt, lewis, mumford, charles, abrams, and, william, h, whyte, as, well, as, carmine, de, sapio, a, greenwich, village, resident, and, influential, democratic, leader, de, sapio, s, involvement, proved, decisive, on, 25, june, 1958, the, city, closed, washington, square, park, to, traffic, and, the, joint, committee, held, a, ribbon, tying, not, cutting, ceremony, plans, for, lomex, expressway, continued, despite, growing, community, opposition, in, areas, such, as, little, italy, in, the, 1960s, jacobs, chaired, the, joint, committee, to, stop, the, lower, manhattan, expressway, the, new, york, times, was, sympathetic, to, moses, while, the, village, voice, covered, community, rallies, and, advocated, against, the, expressway, jacobs, continued, to, fight, the, expressway, when, plans, resurfaced, in, 1962, 1965, and, 1968, and, she, became, a, local, hero, for, her, opposition, to, the, project, she, was, arrested, by, a, plainclothes, police, officer, on, 10, april, 1968, at, a, public, hearing, during, which, the, crowd, had, charged, the, stage, and, destroyed, the, stenographer, s, notes, she, was, accused, of, inciting, a, riot, criminal, mischief, and, obstructing, public, administration, after, months, of, trials, conducted, in, new, york, city, to, which, jacobs, commuted, from, toronto, her, charge, was, reduced, to, disorderly, conduct, new, york, a, documentary, film, devoted, an, hour, of, the, eight, part, seventeen, and, a, half, hour, series, to, the, battle, between, moses, and, jacobs, robert, caro, s, biography, of, moses, the, power, broker, gives, only, passing, mention, to, this, event, however, despite, jacobs, s, strong, influence, on, caro, in, 2017, caro, told, an, interviewer, about, the, difficulty, in, cutting, more, than, 300, 000, words, from, his, initial, manuscript, the, section, that, i, wrote, on, jane, jacobs, disappeared, to, this, day, when, someone, says, there, s, hardly, a, mention, of, jane, jacobs, i, think, but, i, wrote, a, lot, about, her, every, time, i, m, asked, about, that, i, have, this, sick, feeling, soon, after, her, arrest, in, 1968, jacobs, moved, to, toronto, eventually, settling, at, 69, albany, avenue, in, the, annex, from, 1971, until, her, death, in, 2006, she, decided, to, leave, the, us, in, part, because, she, opposed, the, vietnam, war, she, worried, about, the, fate, of, her, two, draft, age, sons, and, she, did, not, want, to, continue, fighting, the, new, york, city, government, she, and, her, husband, chose, toronto, because, it, was, pleasant, and, offered, employment, opportunities, and, they, moved, to, an, area, of, toronto, that, included, so, many, americans, avoiding, the, draft, that, it, was, called, the, american, ghetto, she, quickly, became, a, leading, figure, in, her, new, city, and, helped, stop, the, proposed, spadina, expressway, a, frequent, theme, of, her, work, was, to, ask, whether, cities, were, being, built, for, people, or, for, cars, she, was, arrested, twice, during, demonstrations, she, also, had, considerable, influence, on, the, regeneration, of, the, st, lawrence, neighbourhood, a, housing, project, regarded, as, a, major, success, she, became, a, canadian, citizen, in, 1974, and, later, she, told, writer, james, howard, kunstler, that, dual, citizenship, was, not, possible, at, the, time, implying, that, her, us, citizenship, was, lost, in, 1980, she, offered, a, more, urban, perspective, on, quebec, s, sovereignty, in, her, book, the, question, of, separatism, quebec, and, the, struggle, over, separation, jacobs, was, an, advocate, of, a, province, of, toronto, to, separate, the, city, proper, from, ontario, jacobs, said, cities, to, thrive, in, the, twenty, first, century, must, separate, themselves, politically, from, their, surrounding, areas, she, was, selected, to, be, an, officer, of, the, order, of, canada, in, 1996, for, her, seminal, writings, and, thought, provoking, commentaries, on, urban, development, the, community, and, urban, sociology, section, of, the, american, sociological, association, awarded, her, its, outstanding, lifetime, contribution, award, in, 2002, in, 1997, the, city, government, of, toronto, sponsored, a, conference, entitled, jane, jacobs, ideas, that, matter, which, led, to, a, book, by, the, same, name, at, the, end, of, the, conference, the, jane, jacobs, prize, was, created, it, includes, an, annual, stipend, of, 5, 000, for, three, years, to, be, given, to, celebrate, toronto, s, original, unsung, heroes, by, seeking, out, citizens, who, are, engaged, in, activities, that, contribute, to, the, city, s, vitality, jacobs, never, shied, away, from, expressing, her, political, support, for, specific, candidates, she, opposed, the, 1997, amalgamation, of, the, cities, of, metro, toronto, fearing, that, individual, neighbourhoods, would, have, less, power, with, the, new, structure, she, backed, an, ecologist, tooker, gomberg, who, lost, toronto, s, 2000, mayoralty, race, and, she, was, an, adviser, to, david, miller, s, successful, mayoral, campaign, in, 2003, at, a, time, when, he, was, seen, as, a, longshot, during, the, mayoral, campaign, jacobs, helped, lobby, against, the, construction, of, a, bridge, to, join, the, city, waterfront, to, island, airport, on, the, toronto, islands, following, the, election, the, toronto, city, council, s, earlier, decision, to, approve, the, bridge, was, reversed, and, the, bridge, construction, project, was, stopped, the, airport, instead, upgraded, the, ferry, service, and, later, built, a, pedestrian, tunnel, jacobs, also, was, active, in, a, campaign, against, a, plan, of, royal, st, george, s, college, an, established, school, very, close, to, the, jacobs, residence, in, toronto, s, annex, district, to, reconfigure, its, facilities, jacobs, suggested, not, only, that, the, redesign, be, stopped, but, that, the, school, be, forced, from, the, neighbourhood, entirely, although, toronto, council, initially, rejected, the, school, s, plans, the, decision, later, was, reversed, and, the, project, was, given, the, go, ahead, by, the, ontario, municipal, board, omb, when, opponents, failed, to, produce, credible, witnesses, and, tried, to, withdraw, from, the, case, during, the, hearing, she, also, had, an, influence, on, vancouver, s, urban, planning, jacobs, has, been, called, the, mother, of, vancouverism, referring, to, that, city, s, use, of, her, density, done, well, philosophy, jacobs, died, in, toronto, western, hospital, aged, 89, on, 25, april, 2006, apparently, of, a, stroke, she, was, survived, by, a, brother, james, butzner, d, 2009, a, daughter, burgin, jacobs, her, sons, james, and, ned, of, vancouver, and, by, two, grandchildren, and, two, great, grandchildren, upon, her, death, her, family, s, statement, noted, what, s, important, is, not, that, she, died, but, that, she, lived, and, that, her, life, s, work, has, greatly, influenced, the, way, we, think, please, remember, her, by, reading, her, books, and, implementing, her, ideas, jacobs, is, credited, along, with, lewis, mumford, with, inspiring, the, new, urbanist, movement, she, has, been, characterized, as, a, major, influence, on, decentralist, and, radical, centrist, thought, she, discussed, her, legacy, in, an, interview, with, reason, magazine, reason, what, do, you, think, you, ll, be, remembered, for, most, you, were, the, one, who, stood, up, to, the, federal, bulldozers, and, the, urban, renewal, people, and, said, they, were, destroying, the, lifeblood, of, these, cities, is, that, what, it, will, be, jacobs, no, if, i, were, to, be, remembered, as, a, really, important, thinker, of, the, century, the, most, important, thing, i, ve, contributed, is, my, discussion, of, what, makes, economic, expansion, happen, this, is, something, that, has, puzzled, people, always, i, think, i, ve, figured, out, what, it, is, expansion, and, development, are, two, different, things, development, is, differentiation, of, what, already, existed, practically, every, new, thing, that, happens, is, a, differentiation, of, a, previous, thing, from, a, new, shoe, sole, to, changes, in, legal, codes, expansion, is, an, actual, growth, in, size, or, volume, of, activity, that, is, a, different, thing, i, ve, gone, at, it, two, different, ways, way, back, when, i, wrote, the, economy, of, cities, i, wrote, about, import, replacing, and, how, that, expands, not, just, the, economy, of, the, place, where, it, occurs, but, economic, life, altogether, as, a, city, replaces, imports, it, shifts, its, imports, it, doesn, t, import, less, and, yet, it, has, everything, it, had, before, reason, it, s, not, a, zero, sum, game, it, s, a, bigger, growing, pie, jacobs, that, s, the, actual, mechanism, of, it, the, theory, of, it, is, what, i, explain, in, the, nature, of, economies, i, equate, it, to, what, happens, with, biomass, the, sum, total, of, all, flora, and, fauna, in, an, area, the, energy, the, material, that, s, involved, in, this, doesn, t, just, escape, the, community, as, an, export, it, continues, being, used, in, a, community, just, as, in, a, rainforest, the, waste, from, certain, organisms, and, various, plants, and, animals, gets, used, by, other, ones, in, the, place, while, jacobs, saw, her, greatest, legacy, to, be, her, contributions, to, economic, theory, it, is, in, the, realm, of, urban, planning, that, she, has, had, her, most, extensive, effect, her, observations, about, the, ways, in, which, cities, function, revolutionized, the, urban, planning, profession, and, discredited, many, accepted, planning, models, that, had, dominated, mid, century, planning, the, influential, harvard, economist, edward, glaeser, known, for, his, work, on, urban, studies, acknowledged, that, jane, jacobs, 1960s, had, been, prescient, in, attacking, moses, for, replacing, well, functioning, neighborhoods, with, le, corbusier, inspired, towers, glaeser, agreed, that, these, housing, projects, proved, to, be, moses, greatest, failures, moses, spent, millions, and, evicted, tens, of, thousands, to, create, buildings, that, became, centers, of, crime, poverty, and, despair, she, also, was, famous, for, introducing, concepts, such, as, the, ballet, of, the, sidewalk, and, eyes, on, the, street, a, reference, to, what, would, later, be, known, as, natural, surveillance, the, concept, had, a, huge, influence, on, planners, and, architects, such, as, oscar, newman, who, prepared, the, idea, through, a, series, of, studies, that, would, culminate, in, his, defensible, space, theory, the, work, of, jacobs, and, newman, would, go, on, to, affect, american, housing, policy, through, the, hope, vi, program, an, effort, by, the, united, states, department, of, housing, and, urban, development, to, demolish, the, high, rise, public, housing, projects, so, reviled, by, jacobs, and, to, replace, them, with, low, rise, mixed, income, housing, throughout, her, life, jacobs, fought, to, alter, the, way, in, which, city, development, was, approached, by, arguing, that, cities, were, living, beings, and, ecosystems, she, advocated, ideas, such, as, mixed, use, development, and, bottom, up, planning, furthermore, her, harsh, criticisms, of, slum, clearing, and, high, rise, housing, projects, were, instrumental, in, discrediting, these, once, universally, supported, planning, practices, jacobs, is, remembered, as, being, an, advocate, for, the, mindful, development, of, cities, and, for, leaving, a, legacy, of, empowerment, for, citizens, to, trust, their, common, sense, and, become, advocates, for, their, place, despite, the, fact, that, jacobs, mainly, focused, on, new, york, city, her, arguments, have, been, identified, as, universal, for, instance, her, opposition, against, the, demolition, of, urban, neighborhoods, for, projects, of, urban, renewal, had, special, resonance, in, melbourne, australia, in, melbourne, in, the, 1960s, resident, associations, fought, against, large, scale, high, rise, housing, projects, of, the, housing, commission, of, victoria, which, they, argued, had, little, regard, for, the, impact, on, local, communities, jacobs, fought, an, uphill, battle, against, dominant, trends, of, planning, despite, the, united, states, remaining, very, much, a, suburban, nation, the, work, of, jacobs, has, contributed, to, city, living, being, rehabilitated, and, revitalized, because, of, her, ideas, today, many, distressed, urban, neighborhoods, are, more, likely, to, be, gentrified, than, cleared, for, redevelopment, it, may, be, that, we, have, become, so, feckless, as, a, people, that, we, no, longer, care, how, things, do, work, but, only, what, kind, of, quick, easy, outer, impression, they, give, if, so, there, is, little, hope, for, our, cities, or, probably, for, much, else, in, our, society, but, i, do, not, think, this, is, so, in, her, book, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, written, in, 1961, ms, jacobs, s, enormous, achievement, was, to, transcend, her, own, withering, critique, of, 20th, century, urban, planning, and, propose, radically, new, principles, for, rebuilding, cities, at, a, time, when, both, common, and, inspired, wisdom, called, for, bulldozing, slums, and, opening, up, city, space, ms, jacobs, s, prescription, was, ever, more, diversity, density, and, dynamism, in, effect, to, crowd, people, and, activities, together, in, a, jumping, joyous, urban, jumble, samuel, r, delany, s, book, times, square, red, times, square, blue, relies, heavily, on, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, in, its, analysis, of, the, nature, of, social, relations, within, the, realm, of, urban, studies, after, the, death, of, jacobs, in, april, 2006, new, york, city, mayor, michael, bloomberg, announced, a, jane, jacobs, day, held, on, 28, june, 2006, the, city, of, toronto, proclaimed, her, birthday, the, following, year, 4, may, 2007, as, jane, jacobs, day, in, connection, with, jane, jacobs, day, in, toronto, two, dozen, free, neighborhood, walks, in, the, city, were, offered, that, weekend, 5, may, 2007, as, an, active, memorial, to, jacobs, and, they, were, dubbed, jane, s, walks, later, a, jane, s, walk, event, was, held, in, new, york, on, 29, 30, september, 2007, in, 2008, the, event, spread, to, eight, cities, and, towns, throughout, canada, and, by, 2016, jane, s, walks, were, taking, place, in, 212, cities, in, 36, countries, on, six, continents, the, interpretive, walks, typically, apply, ideas, jacobs, identified, or, espoused, to, local, areas, which, are, explored, on, foot, and, sometimes, by, bicycle, the, walks, normally, take, place, in, early, may, on, or, close, to, her, 4, may, birth, anniversary, walks, are, organized, and, led, by, local, volunteers, coordinated, by, a, headquarters, office, in, toronto, there, are, more, than, 200, walks, offered, in, toronto, alone, in, 2016, taking, place, on, 6, 7, and, 8, may, in, 2016, to, mark, the, hundredth, birth, anniversary, of, jane, jacobs, a, toronto, gallery, staged, jane, at, home, an, exhibition, running, from, 29, april, 8, may, curated, by, jane, s, son, jim, jacobs, it, offered, glimpses, of, her, home, life, where, she, also, worked, her, toronto, living, room, was, represented, based, on, the, one, at, her, albany, avenue, house, in, the, annex, where, she, often, spoke, with, noted, thinkers, and, political, leaders, including, marshall, mcluhan, paul, martin, and, the, queen, of, the, netherlands, on, display, were, her, typewriter, original, manuscripts, rediscovered, photographs, demonstrating, her, distinctive, styles, and, personal, mementos, the, exhibit, included, furniture, from, previous, homes, in, new, york, her, dining, room, is, set, up, and, from, scranton, pennsylvania, in, 2007, the, municipal, art, society, of, new, york, partnered, with, the, rockefeller, foundation, to, host, an, exhibit, focusing, on, jane, jacobs, and, the, future, of, new, york, which, opened, at, the, society, in, september, that, year, the, exhibit, aimed, to, educate, the, public, on, her, writings, and, activism, and, used, tools, to, encourage, new, generations, to, become, active, in, issues, involving, their, own, neighborhoods, an, accompanying, exhibit, publication, included, essays, and, articles, by, such, architecture, critics, artists, activists, and, journalists, as, malcolm, gladwell, reverend, billy, robert, neuwirth, tom, wolfe, thomas, de, monchaux, and, william, mcdonough, many, of, these, contributors, participated, in, a, series, of, panel, discussions, on, jane, jacobs, and, the, future, of, new, york, as, a, tribute, to, jacobs, the, rockefeller, foundation, which, had, awarded, grants, to, jacobs, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, announced, on, 9, february, 2007, the, creation, of, the, jane, jacobs, medal, to, recognize, individuals, who, have, made, a, significant, contribution, to, thinking, about, urban, design, specifically, in, new, york, city, recipients, include, the, canadian, urban, institute, offers, an, award, to, honor, her, the, jane, jacobs, lifetime, achievement, award, to, recognize, a, person, who, has, had, significant, impact, on, the, health, of, their, region, consistent, with, jane, jacob, s, belief, that, successful, cities, foster, a, place, based, community, centered, approach, the, 2011, winner, was, eberhard, zeidler, while, his, daughter, margie, zeidler, won, the, 2015, award, in, 2012, anne, golden, took, the, prize, for, her, long, standing, leadership, in, public, policy, her, academic, work, and, her, varied, leadership, experience, in, business, not, for, profit, and, government, sectors, william, bill, teron, accepted, the, 2013, award, for, his, influential, career, in, public, policy, and, passionate, advocacy, for, quality, design, and, commitment, to, development, in, the, ottawa, area, in, 2014, jack, diamond, was, recognized, for, his, contribution, to, improving, the, built, form, and, advocacy, for, cities, and, the, future, of, the, greater, toronto, area, in, april, 2014, spacing, was, appointed, the, stewards, of, the, jane, jacobs, prize, spacing, winners, of, the, prize, in, 2010, has, continued, to, provide, the, award, with, a, new, life, and, new, ways, of, promoting, and, finding, the, winners, jacobs, received, the, second, vincent, scully, prize, from, the, national, building, museum, in, 2000, jacobs, is, the, subject, of, the, 2017, documentary, film, citizen, jane, battle, for, the, city, which, depicts, her, victories, over, robert, moses, and, her, philosophy, of, urban, design, the, planners, and, developers, she, fought, against, to, preserve, the, west, village, were, among, those, who, initially, criticized, her, ideas, robert, moses, has, generally, been, identified, as, her, arch, rival, during, this, period, one, of, their, primary, differences, was, their, opposite, views, the, top, down, aggressive, approach, practiced, by, moses, contracted, the, bottom, up, approach, practiced, by, jacobs, that, considered, the, community, since, then, jacobs, s, ideas, have, been, analysed, many, times, often, in, regard, to, the, outcomes, that, their, influences, have, produced, in, places, such, as, the, west, village, the, factors, that, she, argued, would, maintain, economic, and, cultural, diversity, have, led, instead, to, gentrification, and, some, of, the, most, expensive, real, estate, in, the, world, her, family, s, conversion, of, an, old, candy, shop, into, a, home, is, an, example, of, the, gentrifying, trend, that, would, continue, under, the, influence, of, jacobs, s, ideas, gentrification, also, was, caused, however, by, the, completely, unexpected, influx, of, affluent, residents, back, into, the, inner, city, the, extent, to, which, her, ideas, facilitated, this, phenomenon, was, at, the, time, unimaginable, for, example, she, advocated, the, preservation, of, older, buildings, specifically, because, their, lack, of, economic, value, made, them, affordable, for, poor, people, in, this, respect, she, saw, them, as, guarantors, of, social, diversity, that, many, of, these, older, structures, have, increased, in, economic, value, solely, due, to, their, age, was, implausible, in, 1961, issues, of, gentrification, have, dominated, criticism, of, jane, jacobs, s, planning, ideas, economist, tyler, cowen, has, criticized, her, ideas, for, not, addressing, problems, of, scale, or, infrastructure, and, suggests, that, economists, disagree, with, some, of, her, approaches, to, development, for, example, although, her, ideas, of, planning, were, praised, at, times, as, universal, they, are, now, thought, inapplicable, when, a, city, grows, from, one, million, to, ten, million, as, has, happened, many, times, in, developing, nations, such, arguments, suggest, that, her, ideas, apply, only, to, cities, with, similar, issues, to, those, of, new, york, where, jacobs, developed, many, of, them, jane, jacobs, spent, her, life, studying, cities, her, books, include, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, is, her, single, most, influential, book, and, possibly, the, most, influential, book, on, urban, planning, and, cities, published, in, 1961, this, book, was, widely, read, by, both, planning, professionals, and, the, general, public, the, book, is, a, strong, critique, of, the, urban, renewal, policies, of, the, 1950s, which, she, claimed, destroyed, communities, and, created, isolated, unnatural, urban, spaces, in, the, book, she, celebrates, the, diversity, and, complexity, of, old, mixed, use, neighborhoods, while, lamenting, the, monotony, and, sterility, of, modern, planning, jacobs, advocated, the, abolition, of, zoning, laws, and, restoration, of, free, markets, in, land, which, would, result, in, dense, mixed, use, neighborhoods, and, she, frequently, cited, new, york, city, s, greenwich, village, as, an, example, of, a, vibrant, urban, community, robert, caro, has, cited, it, as, the, strongest, influence, on, the, power, broker, his, pulitzer, winning, biography, of, robert, moses, although, caro, does, not, mention, jacobs, by, name, in, the, book, despite, jacobs, s, battles, with, moses, over, his, proposed, lower, manhattan, expressway, caro, reportedly, cut, a, chapter, about, jacobs, due, to, his, book, s, length, beyond, the, practical, lessons, in, city, design, and, planning, that, death, and, life, offers, the, theoretical, underpinnings, of, the, work, challenge, the, modern, development, mindset, jane, jacobs, defends, her, positions, with, common, sense, and, anecdotes, the, thesis, of, this, book, is, that, cities, are, the, primary, drivers, of, economic, development, her, main, argument, is, that, explosive, economic, growth, derives, from, urban, import, replacement, import, replacement, is, the, process, of, producing, goods, locally, that, formerly, were, imported, e, g, tokyo, bicycle, factories, replacing, tokyo, bicycle, importers, in, the, 1800s, jacobs, claims, that, import, replacement, builds, up, local, infrastructure, skills, and, production, jacobs, also, claims, that, the, increased, production, is, subsequently, exported, to, other, cities, giving, those, other, cities, a, new, opportunity, to, engage, in, import, replacement, thus, producing, a, positive, cycle, of, growth, in, an, interview, with, bill, steigerwald, in, reason, jacobs, said, that, if, she, is, remembered, for, being, a, great, intellectual, she, will, be, remembered, not, for, her, work, concerning, city, planning, but, for, the, discovery, of, import, replacement, critics, erroneously, claim, that, her, ideas, parrot, the, idea, of, import, substitution, advanced, earlier, by, scholars, such, as, andre, gunder, frank, import, substitution, was, a, national, economic, theory, implying, that, if, a, nation, substituted, its, imports, with, national, production, the, nation, would, become, wealthier, whereas, jacob, s, idea, is, entirely, about, cities, and, could, be, called, urban, import, substitution, however, even, this, would, lead, to, confusion, since, in, practice, import, substitution, in, india, and, latin, america, were, government, subsidized, and, mandated, whereas, jacobs, s, concept, of, import, replacement, is, a, free, market, process, of, discovery, and, division, of, labor, within, a, city, in, the, second, part, of, the, book, jacobs, argues, that, cities, preceded, agriculture, she, argues, that, in, cities, trade, in, wild, animals, and, grains, allowed, for, the, initial, division, of, labor, necessary, for, the, discovery, of, husbandry, and, agriculture, these, discoveries, then, moved, out, of, the, city, due, to, land, competition, it, is, commonly, taught, that, agriculture, preceded, cities, this, notion, was, promoted, originally, by, archaeologist, vere, gordon, childe, and, in, recent, times, by, charles, keith, maisels, the, apparent, opposition, between, the, traditional, history, and, jacobs, rests, in, differing, definition, of, city, civilization, or, urban, traditional, history, and, archeology, define, urban, or, civilization, as, synoecism, as, a, literate, socially, stratified, monolithic, political, community, whereas, as, one, can, see, from, the, economy, of, cities, or, from, cities, and, the, wealth, of, nations, jacobs, defined, the, city, purely, along, the, lines, of, geographically, dense, trade, giving, way, to, entrepreneurial, discovery, and, subsequent, improvements, in, the, division, of, labor, without, the, requirements, of, literacy, permanent, and, monumental, building, or, the, signs, of, specialized, civil, and, armed, forces, cities, can, be, accurately, interpreted, as, existing, thousands, of, years, before, when, childe, and, maisels, place, them, the, question, of, separatism, quebec, and, the, struggle, over, sovereignty, incorporated, and, expanded, jacobs, s, presentation, of, the, 1979, massey, lectures, entitled, canadian, cities, and, sovereignty, association, it, was, published, in, 1980, and, reprinted, in, 2011, with, a, previously, unpublished, 2005, interview, with, robin, philpot, on, the, subject, in, which, she, evokes, the, relative, overlooking, of, that, book, among, her, usual, readership, this, was, the, first, time, jacobs, was, requested, to, discuss, it, in, an, interview, columnist, richard, gwyn, advanced, that, while, not, openly, criticizing, her, english, speaking, canadian, readers, thought, she, did, not, understand, how, canadian, politics, worked, and, that, she, was, not, being, helpful, in, a, time, of, distress, for, national, unity, the, 1980, referendum, was, just, defeated, by, a, vote, of, 60, per, cent, the, question, of, separatism, was, also, not, mentioned, in, the, bibliography, of, her, 2006, obituary, in, the, globe, and, mail, jacobs, s, book, advances, the, view, that, quebec, s, eventual, independence, is, best, for, montreal, toronto, the, rest, of, canada, and, the, world, and, that, such, independence, can, be, achieved, peacefully, as, precedent, she, cites, norway, s, secession, from, sweden, and, how, it, enriched, both, nations, the, origins, of, the, contemporary, secessionist, movement, in, the, quiet, revolution, are, examined, along, with, canada, s, historical, reliance, on, natural, resources, and, foreign, owned, manufacturing, for, its, own, economic, development, jacobs, asserts, that, such, an, approach, is, colonial, and, hence, backward, citing, by, example, canada, buying, its, skis, and, furniture, from, norway, or, norwegian, owned, factories, in, canada, the, latter, procedure, being, a, product, of, canadian, tariffs, designed, specifically, to, foster, such, factories, the, relevant, public, views, of, ren, l, vesque, claude, ryan, and, then, prime, minister, pierre, trudeau, are, also, critically, analyzed, an, example, being, their, failure, to, recognize, that, two, respective, independent, currencies, are, essential, to, the, success, of, an, independent, quebec, and, a, smaller, resultant, canada, an, issue, that, is, central, to, her, book, jacobs, stresses, the, need, for, montreal, to, continue, developing, its, leadership, of, qu, b, cois, culture, but, that, ultimately, such, a, need, can, never, be, fulfilled, by, montreal, s, increasing, tendencies, toward, regional, city, status, tendencies, foretelling, economic, political, and, cultural, subservience, to, english, speaking, toronto, such, an, outcome, jacobs, believed, would, in, the, long, run, doom, quebec, s, independence, as, much, as, it, would, hinder, canada, s, own, future, she, concludes, with, her, observation, that, the, popular, equating, of, political, secession, with, political, and, economic, failure, is, the, result, of, the, enlightenment, which, perceived, nature, as, a, force, for, standardization, uniformity, universality, and, immutability, since, then, naturalists, and, their, readers, have, gradually, realized, that, nature, is, a, force, for, diversity, and, that, diversity, itself, is, of, the, essence, of, excellence, the, right, kind, of, secession, jacobs, states, can, lead, to, the, right, kind, of, diversity, and, quebec, and, canada, are, capable, of, both, and, must, achieve, both, to, survive, cities, and, the, wealth, of, nations, 1984, attempts, to, do, for, economics, what, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, did, for, modern, urban, planning, although, it, has, not, received, the, same, critical, attention, beginning, with, a, concise, treatment, of, classical, economics, this, book, challenges, one, of, the, fundamental, assumptions, of, the, greatest, economists, classical, and, neo, classical, economists, consider, the, nation, state, to, be, the, main, player, in, macroeconomics, jacobs, argues, that, it, is, not, the, nation, state, rather, it, is, the, city, that, is, the, true, player, in, this, worldwide, game, she, restates, the, idea, of, import, replacement, from, her, earlier, book, the, economy, of, cities, while, speculating, on, the, further, ramifications, of, considering, the, city, first, and, the, nation, second, or, not, at, all, a, spectrum, of, economic, regions, along, with, the, previous, books, focused, on, economics, jacobs, proposes, an, array, of, types, of, regional, economies, stylized, facts, which, can, help, to, understand, their, different, challenges, and, potential, for, development, one, can, start, at, the, bottom, end, of, the, spectrum, with, the, backward, region, which, are, economies, who, have, lost, their, competitive, advantages, and, are, losing, population, or, becoming, dependent, on, largesse, transfers, from, wealthier, areas, next, are, the, supply, regions, which, are, usually, known, as, natural, resource, extraction, towns, and, may, be, very, wealthy, during, their, heyday, but, often, suffer, a, decline, into, backwardness, if, the, resource, has, run, out, or, has, been, substituted, on, outside, markets, similar, to, this, is, the, transplant, region, a, fundamental, aspect, of, jacobs, economic, theory, transplant, economies, are, usually, manufacturing, plants, who, have, been, moved, from, the, location, where, the, product, was, invented, the, reason, for, the, transplant, is, to, save, land, labour, fiscal, and, transportation, costs, transplant, regions, are, usually, found, along, main, transportation, routes, where, there, is, a, large, labour, pool, of, available, labour, backward, regions, supply, regions, and, transplant, regions, make, up, the, most, vulnerable, types, of, economies, to, outside, shocks, and, competition, from, low, cost, production, zones, the, jacobs, spectrum, of, regions, also, includes, types, of, cities, which, rely, on, classical, principles, of, central, location, jacobs, discusses, entrep, t, cities, which, are, economies, based, on, the, accumulation, and, warehousing, of, export, goods, usually, at, a, maritime, port, location, next, are, hub, cities, or, regional, capitals, which, are, central, locations, for, private, markets, and, public, services, in, a, given, geography, finally, jacobs, presents, the, qualities, of, growing, metropolitan, areas, jacobs, defines, the, metropolis, as, a, city, that, grows, beyond, its, political, borders, she, terms, the, core, city, as, the, import, replacing, city, she, terms, the, suburban, sprawl, of, the, metropolis, as, the, city, region, economic, literature, sometimes, uses, the, term, jacobs, agglomeration, for, these, growing, and, innovative, cities, ca, ramsay, has, proposed, the, term, forward, cities, as, an, echo, to, the, opposing, principle, of, backward, economies, according, to, jacobs, economies, are, constantly, evolving, and, may, move, in, and, out, of, any, of, these, categories, however, for, an, export, based, economy, such, as, a, supply, region, or, a, transplant, town, to, develop, into, a, forward, city, the, economy, must, engage, in, what, she, terms, new, work, this, implies, a, diversification, of, the, economy, jacobs, strongly, encourages, breakaway, entrepreneurship, and, local, investment, capital, to, do, this, the, modus, operandi, may, be, in, import, replacing, in, world, first, innovation, or, the, adoption, of, production, which, is, new, to, the, community, jacobs, also, insists, on, the, benefits, of, having, a, city, currency, which, acts, as, a, positive, feedback, mechanism, to, help, drive, local, innovation, and, import, replacement, it, also, protects, from, outside, demand, shocks, systems, of, survival, a, dialogue, on, the, moral, foundations, of, commerce, and, politics, 1992, moves, outside, of, the, city, studying, the, moral, underpinnings, of, work, as, with, her, other, work, she, used, an, observational, approach, this, book, is, written, as, a, platonic, dialogue, it, appears, that, she, as, described, by, characters, in, her, book, took, newspaper, clippings, of, moral, judgments, related, to, work, collected, and, sorted, them, to, find, that, they, fit, two, patterns, of, moral, behavior, that, were, mutually, exclusive, she, calls, these, two, patterns, moral, syndrome, a, or, commercial, moral, syndrome, and, moral, syndrome, b, or, guardian, moral, syndrome, she, claims, that, the, commercial, moral, syndrome, is, applicable, to, business, owners, scientists, farmers, and, traders, similarly, she, claims, that, the, guardian, moral, syndrome, is, applicable, to, government, charities, hunter, gatherers, and, religious, institutions, she, also, claims, that, these, moral, syndromes, are, fixed, and, do, not, fluctuate, over, time, it, is, important, to, stress, that, jane, jacobs, is, providing, a, theory, about, the, morality, of, work, and, not, all, moral, ideas, moral, ideas, that, are, not, included, in, her, system, are, applicable, to, both, syndromes, jane, jacobs, goes, on, to, describe, what, happens, when, these, two, moral, syndromes, are, mixed, showing, the, work, underpinnings, of, the, mafia, and, communism, and, what, happens, when, new, york, subway, police, are, paid, bonuses, here, reinterpreted, slightly, as, a, part, of, the, larger, analysis, the, nature, of, economies, 2000, a, dialog, between, friends, concerning, the, premise, human, beings, exist, wholly, within, nature, as, part, of, the, natural, order, in, every, respect, p, ix, argues, that, the, same, principles, underlie, both, ecosystems, and, economies, development, and, co, development, through, differentiation, and, their, combinations, expansion, through, diverse, multiple, uses, of, energy, and, self, maintenance, through, self, refueling, p, 82, jacobs, also, comments, on, the, nature, of, economic, and, biological, diversity, and, its, role, in, the, development, and, growth, of, the, two, kinds, of, systems, jacobs, s, characters, discuss, the, four, methods, by, which, dynamically, stable, systems, may, evade, collapse, bifurcations, positive, feedback, loops, negative, feedback, controls, and, emergency, adaptations, p, 86, their, conversations, also, cover, the, double, nature, of, fitness, for, survival, traits, to, avoid, destroying, one, s, own, habitat, as, well, as, success, in, competition, to, feed, and, breed, p, 119, and, unpredictability, including, the, butterfly, effect, characterized, in, terms, of, multiplicity, of, variables, as, well, as, disproportional, response, to, cause, and, self, organization, where, a, system, can, be, making, itself, up, as, it, goes, along, p, 137, the, book, is, infused, with, many, real, world, economic, and, biological, examples, which, help, keep, the, book, down, to, earth, and, comprehensible, if, dense, concepts, are, furnished, with, both, economic, and, biological, examples, showing, their, coherence, in, both, worlds, one, particularly, interesting, insight, is, the, creation, of, something, from, nothing, an, economy, from, nowhere, in, the, biological, world, free, energy, is, given, through, sunlight, but, in, the, economic, world, human, creativity, and, natural, resources, supply, this, free, energy, or, at, least, starter, energy, another, interesting, insight, is, the, creation, of, economic, diversity, through, the, combination, of, different, technologies, for, example, the, typewriter, and, television, as, inputs, and, outputs, of, a, computer, system, this, can, lead, to, the, creation, of, new, species, of, work, published, in, 2004, by, random, house, dark, age, ahead, posits, jacobs, s, argument, that, north, american, civilization, shows, signs, of, a, spiral, decline, comparable, to, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, her, discussion, focuses, on, five, pillars, of, our, culture, that, we, depend, on, to, stand, firm, which, can, be, summarized, as, the, nuclear, family, and, community,
