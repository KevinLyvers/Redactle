depressing, decisions, in, america, are, based, solely, on, the, question, of, how, much, money, will, come, out, of, it, and, not, on, the, questions, of, how, much, health, morals, or, environment,

discussion, that, followed, chung, stated, can, i, be, honest, with, you, i, can, tell, you, that, when, i, read, this, i, have, to, tell, you, that, i, thought, it, was, un, american, unpatriotic, i, wanted, to, say, go, back, to, czechoslovakia, you, know, if, you, don, t, like, it, here, this, a, country, that, gave, you, so, much, gave, you, the, freedom, to, do, what, you, want, navratilova, responded, and, i, m, giving, it, back, this, is, why, i, speak, out, when, i, see, something, that, i, don, t, like, i, m, going, to, speak, out, because, you, can, do, that, here, and, again, i, feel, there, are, too, many, things, happening, that, are, taking, our, rights, away, navratilova, was, quoted, in, 2007, as, being, ashamed, of, the, u, s, under, president, george, w, bush, because,

growing, tendency, among, transgender, activists, to, denounce, anyone, who, argues, against, them, and, to, label, them, all, as, transphobes, following, an, article, on, the, subject, that, navratilova, wrote, for, the, times, in, february, 2019, athlete, ally, an, lgbtq, athlete, advocacy, group, removed, navratilova, from, their, advisory, board, stating, her, comments, are,

should, be, allowed, to, compete, in, women, s, sport, she, also, called, for, a, debate, a, conversation, that, includes, everyone, and, is, based, as, i, have, said, not, on, feeling, or, emotion, but, science, in, an, april, 2019, article, for, the, washington, post, she, opined, that, the, equality, act, in, its, current, form, would, make, it, unlawful, to, differentiate, among, girls, and,

including, trans, women, athletes, and, sports, researchers, presenting, evidence, on, both, sides, of, the, debate, of, whether, trans, women, have, any, advantage, in, elite, sports, her, closing, remarks, were, the, way, i, started, this, journey, i, just, wanted, to, see, if, there, are, any, big, surprises, any, misconceptions, that, i, had, and, what, i, think, i, have, come, to, realise, the, biggest, thing, for, me, is, just, that, the, level, of, difficulty, that, trans, people, go, through, cannot, be, underestimated, the, fight, for, equality, and, recognition, is, just, huge, that, being, said, still, for, me, the, most, important, thing, in, sports, and, you, have, to, remember, trans, rights, and, elite, sports, are, two, different, things, although, of, course, they, are, connected, what, s, the, right, way, to, set, rules, so, that, everybody, feels, like, they, have, a, fighting, chance, it, feels, to, me, that, it, is, impossible, to, come, to, any, real, conclusions, or, write, any, meaningful, rules, until, more, research, is, done, but, for, now, i, think, we, need, to, include, as, many, transgender, athletes, as, possible, within, elite, sports, while, keeping, it, as, level, a, playing, field, as, possible, look, society, has, changed, so, much, things, evolve, things, change, and, maybe, i, need, to, evolve, i, need, to, change, the, rules, certainly, need, to, evolve, if, you, don, t, adapt, you, ve, got, problems, and, so, we, ll, just, keep, adapting, and, try, to, find, a, happy, way, forward, in, august, 2020, navratilova, along,
