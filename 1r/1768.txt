george, stephenson, 9, june, 1781, 12, august, 1848, was, an, english, civil, engineer, and, mechanical, engineer, during, the, industrial, revolution, renowned, as, the, father, of, railways, stephenson, was, considered, by, the, victorians, as, a, great, example, of, diligent, application, and, thirst, for, improvement, his, chosen, rail, gauge, sometimes, called, stephenson, gauge, was, the, basis, for, the, 4, foot, 8, 1, 2, inch, 1, 435, m, standard, gauge, used, by, most, of, the, world, s, railways, pioneered, by, stephenson, rail, transport, was, one, of, the, most, important, technological, inventions, of, the, 19th, century, and, a, key, component, of, the, industrial, revolution, built, by, george, and, his, son, robert, s, company, robert, stephenson, and, company, the, locomotion, no, 1, was, the, first, steam, locomotive, to, carry, passengers, on, a, public, rail, line, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, 1825, george, also, built, the, first, public, inter, city, railway, line, in, the, world, to, use, locomotives, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, which, opened, in, 1830, george, stephenson, was, born, on, 9, june, 1781, in, wylam, northumberland, which, is, 9, miles, 15, km, west, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, he, was, the, second, child, of, robert, and, mabel, stephenson, neither, of, whom, could, read, or, write, robert, was, the, fireman, for, wylam, colliery, pumping, engine, earning, a, very, low, wage, so, there, was, no, money, for, schooling, at, 17, stephenson, became, an, engineman, at, water, row, pit, in, newburn, nearby, george, realised, the, value, of, education, and, paid, to, study, at, night, school, to, learn, reading, writing, and, arithmetic, he, was, illiterate, until, the, age, of, 18, in, 1801, he, began, work, at, black, callerton, colliery, south, of, ponteland, as, a, brakesman, controlling, the, winding, gear, at, the, pit, in, 1802, he, married, frances, henderson, and, moved, to, willington, quay, east, of, newcastle, there, he, worked, as, a, brakesman, while, they, lived, in, one, room, of, a, cottage, george, made, shoes, and, mended, clocks, to, supplement, his, income, their, first, child, robert, was, born, in, 1803, and, in, 1804, they, moved, to, dial, cottage, at, west, moor, near, killingworth, where, george, worked, as, a, brakesman, at, killingworth, pit, their, second, child, a, daughter, was, born, in, july, 1805, she, was, named, frances, after, her, mother, the, child, died, after, just, three, weeks, and, was, buried, in, st, bartholomew, s, church, long, benton, north, of, newcastle, in, 1806, george, s, wife, frances, died, of, consumption, tuberculosis, she, was, buried, in, the, same, churchyard, as, their, daughter, on, 16, may, 1806, though, the, location, of, the, grave, is, lost, george, decided, to, find, work, in, scotland, and, left, robert, with, a, local, woman, while, he, went, to, work, in, montrose, after, a, few, months, he, returned, probably, because, his, father, was, blinded, in, a, mining, accident, he, moved, back, into, a, cottage, at, west, moor, and, his, unmarried, sister, eleanor, moved, in, to, look, after, robert, in, 1811, the, pumping, engine, at, high, pit, killingworth, was, not, working, properly, and, stephenson, offered, to, improve, it, he, did, so, with, such, success, that, he, was, promoted, to, enginewright, for, the, collieries, at, killingworth, responsible, for, maintaining, and, repairing, all, the, colliery, engines, he, became, an, expert, in, steam, driven, machinery, in, 1815, aware, of, the, explosions, often, caused, in, mines, by, naked, flames, stephenson, began, to, experiment, with, a, safety, lamp, that, would, burn, in, a, gaseous, atmosphere, without, causing, an, explosion, at, the, same, time, the, eminent, scientist, and, cornishman, humphry, davy, was, also, looking, at, the, problem, despite, his, lack, of, scientific, knowledge, stephenson, by, trial, and, error, devised, a, lamp, in, which, the, air, entered, via, tiny, holes, through, which, the, flames, of, the, lamp, could, not, pass, a, month, before, davy, presented, his, design, to, the, royal, society, stephenson, demonstrated, his, own, lamp, to, two, witnesses, by, taking, it, down, killingworth, colliery, and, holding, it, in, front, of, a, fissure, from, which, firedamp, was, issuing, the, two, designs, differed, davy, s, lamp, was, surrounded, by, a, screen, of, gauze, whereas, stephenson, s, prototype, lamp, had, a, perforated, plate, containing, a, glass, cylinder, for, his, invention, davy, was, awarded, 2000, whilst, stephenson, was, accused, of, stealing, the, idea, from, davy, because, he, was, not, seen, as, an, adequate, scientist, who, could, have, produced, the, lamp, by, any, approved, scientific, method, stephenson, having, come, from, the, north, east, spoke, with, a, broad, northumberland, accent, and, not, the, language, of, parliament, which, made, him, seem, lowly, realizing, this, he, made, a, point, of, educating, his, son, robert, in, a, private, school, where, he, was, taught, to, speak, in, standard, english, with, a, received, pronunciation, accent, it, was, due, to, this, in, their, future, dealings, with, parliament, that, it, became, clear, that, the, authorities, preferred, robert, to, his, father, a, local, committee, of, enquiry, gathered, in, support, of, stephenson, exonerated, him, proved, he, had, been, working, separately, to, create, the, geordie, lamp, and, awarded, him, 1, 000, but, davy, and, his, supporters, refused, to, accept, their, findings, and, would, not, see, how, an, uneducated, man, such, as, stephenson, could, come, up, with, the, solution, he, had, in, 1833, a, house, of, commons, committee, found, that, stephenson, had, equal, claim, to, having, invented, the, safety, lamp, davy, went, to, his, grave, believing, that, stephenson, had, stolen, his, idea, the, stephenson, lamp, was, used, almost, exclusively, in, north, east, england, whereas, the, davy, lamp, was, used, everywhere, else, the, experience, gave, stephenson, a, lifelong, distrust, of, london, based, theoretical, scientific, experts, in, his, book, george, and, robert, stephenson, the, author, l, t, c, rolt, relates, that, opinion, varied, about, the, two, lamps, efficiency, that, the, davy, lamp, gave, more, light, but, the, geordie, lamp, was, thought, to, be, safer, in, a, more, gaseous, atmosphere, he, made, reference, to, an, incident, at, oaks, colliery, in, barnsley, where, both, lamps, were, in, use, following, a, sudden, strong, influx, of, gas, the, tops, of, all, the, davy, lamps, became, red, hot, which, had, in, the, past, caused, an, explosion, and, in, so, doing, risked, another, whilst, all, the, geordie, lamps, simply, went, out, there, is, a, theory, that, it, was, stephenson, who, indirectly, gave, the, name, of, geordies, to, the, people, of, the, north, east, of, england, by, this, theory, the, name, of, the, geordie, lamp, attached, to, the, north, east, pit, men, themselves, by, 1866, any, native, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, could, be, called, a, geordie, cornishman, richard, trevithick, is, credited, with, the, first, realistic, design, for, a, steam, locomotive, the, puffing, devil, in, 1801, later, he, visited, tyneside, and, built, an, engine, there, for, a, mine, owner, several, local, men, were, inspired, by, this, and, designed, their, own, engines, stephenson, designed, his, first, locomotive, in, 1814, a, travelling, engine, designed, for, hauling, coal, on, the, killingworth, wagonway, named, bl, cher, after, the, prussian, general, gebhard, leberecht, von, bl, cher, it, was, suggested, the, name, sprang, from, bl, cher, s, rapid, march, of, his, army, in, support, of, wellington, at, waterloo, bl, cher, was, modelled, on, matthew, murray, s, locomotive, willington, which, george, studied, at, kenton, and, coxlodge, colliery, on, tyneside, and, was, constructed, in, the, colliery, workshop, behind, stephenson, s, home, dial, cottage, on, great, lime, road, the, locomotive, could, haul, 30, tons, of, coal, up, a, hill, at, 4, mph, 6, 4, km, h, and, was, the, first, successful, flanged, wheel, adhesion, locomotive, its, traction, depended, on, contact, between, its, flanged, wheels, and, the, rail, altogether, stephenson, is, said, to, have, produced, 16, locomotives, at, killingworth, although, it, has, not, proved, possible, to, produce, a, convincing, list, of, all, 16, of, those, identified, most, were, built, for, use, at, killingworth, or, for, the, hetton, colliery, railway, a, six, wheeled, locomotive, was, built, for, the, kilmarnock, and, troon, railway, in, 1817, but, was, withdrawn, from, service, because, of, damage, to, the, cast, iron, rails, another, locomotive, was, supplied, to, scott, s, pit, railroad, at, llansamlet, near, swansea, in, 1819, but, it, too, was, withdrawn, apparently, because, it, was, under, boilered, and, again, caused, damage, to, the, track, the, new, engines, were, too, heavy, to, run, on, wooden, rails, or, plate, way, and, iron, edge, rails, were, in, their, infancy, with, cast, iron, exhibiting, excessive, brittleness, together, with, william, losh, stephenson, improved, the, design, of, cast, iron, edge, rails, to, reduce, breakage, rails, were, briefly, made, by, losh, wilson, and, bell, at, their, walker, ironworks, according, to, rolt, stephenson, managed, to, solve, the, problem, caused, by, the, weight, of, the, engine, on, the, primitive, rails, he, experimented, with, a, steam, spring, to, cushion, the, weight, using, steam, pressure, acting, on, pistons, to, support, the, locomotive, frame, but, soon, followed, the, practice, of, distributing, weight, by, using, a, number, of, wheels, or, bogies, for, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, stephenson, used, wrought, iron, malleable, rails, that, he, had, found, satisfactory, notwithstanding, the, financial, loss, he, suffered, by, not, using, his, own, patented, design, stephenson, was, hired, to, build, the, eight, mile, 13, km, hetton, colliery, railway, in, 1820, he, used, a, combination, of, gravity, on, downward, inclines, and, locomotives, for, level, and, upward, stretches, this, the, first, railway, using, no, animal, power, opened, in, 1822, this, line, used, a, gauge, of, 4, ft, 8, in, 1, 422, mm, which, stephenson, had, used, before, at, the, killingworth, wagonway, other, locomotives, include, in, 1821, a, parliamentary, bill, was, passed, to, allow, the, building, of, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, s, dr, the, 25, mile, 40, km, railway, connected, collieries, near, bishop, auckland, to, the, river, tees, at, stockton, passing, through, darlington, on, the, way, the, original, plan, was, to, use, horses, to, draw, coal, carts, on, metal, rails, but, after, company, director, edward, pease, met, stephenson, he, agreed, to, change, the, plans, stephenson, surveyed, the, line, in, 1821, and, assisted, by, his, 18, year, old, son, robert, construction, began, the, same, year, a, manufacturer, was, needed, to, provide, the, locomotives, for, the, line, pease, and, stephenson, had, jointly, established, a, company, in, newcastle, to, manufacture, locomotives, it, was, set, up, as, robert, stephenson, and, company, and, george, s, son, robert, was, the, managing, director, a, fourth, partner, was, michael, longridge, of, bedlington, ironworks, on, an, early, trade, card, robert, stephenson, co, was, described, as, engineers, millwrights, machinists, brass, iron, founders, in, september, 1825, the, works, at, forth, street, newcastle, completed, the, first, locomotive, for, the, railway, originally, named, active, it, was, renamed, locomotion, and, was, followed, by, hope, diligence, and, black, diamond, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, opened, on, 27, september, 1825, driven, by, stephenson, locomotion, hauled, an, 80, ton, load, of, coal, and, flour, nine, miles, 14, km, in, two, hours, reaching, a, speed, of, 24, miles, per, hour, 39, kilometres, per, hour, on, one, stretch, the, first, purpose, built, passenger, car, experiment, was, attached, and, carried, dignitaries, on, the, opening, journey, it, was, the, first, time, passenger, traffic, had, been, run, on, a, steam, locomotive, railway, the, rails, used, for, the, line, were, wrought, iron, produced, by, john, birkinshaw, at, the, bedlington, ironworks, wrought, iron, rails, could, be, produced, in, longer, lengths, than, cast, iron, and, were, less, liable, to, crack, under, the, weight, of, heavy, locomotives, william, losh, of, walker, ironworks, thought, he, had, an, agreement, with, stephenson, to, supply, cast, iron, rails, and, stephenson, s, decision, caused, a, permanent, rift, between, them, the, gauge, stephenson, chose, for, the, line, was, 4, feet, 8, 1, 2, inches, 1, 435, mm, which, subsequently, was, adopted, as, the, standard, gauge, for, railways, not, only, in, britain, but, throughout, the, world, stephenson, had, ascertained, by, experiments, at, killingworth, that, half, the, power, of, the, locomotive, was, consumed, by, a, gradient, as, little, as, 1, in, 260, he, concluded, that, railways, should, be, kept, as, level, as, possible, he, used, this, knowledge, while, working, on, the, bolton, and, leigh, railway, and, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, l, mr, executing, a, series, of, difficult, cuttings, embankments, and, stone, viaducts, to, level, their, routes, defective, surveying, of, the, original, route, of, the, l, mr, caused, by, hostility, from, some, affected, landowners, meant, stephenson, encountered, difficulty, during, parliamentary, scrutiny, of, the, original, bill, especially, under, cross, examination, by, edward, hall, alderson, the, bill, was, rejected, and, a, revised, bill, for, a, new, alignment, was, submitted, and, passed, in, a, subsequent, session, the, revised, alignment, presented, the, problem, of, crossing, chat, moss, an, apparently, bottomless, peat, bog, which, stephenson, overcame, by, unusual, means, effectively, floating, the, line, across, it, the, method, he, used, was, similar, to, that, used, by, john, metcalf, who, constructed, many, miles, of, road, across, marshes, in, the, pennines, laying, a, foundation, of, heather, and, branches, which, became, bound, together, by, the, weight, of, the, passing, coaches, with, a, layer, of, stones, on, top, as, the, l, mr, approached, completion, in, 1829, its, directors, arranged, a, competition, to, decide, who, would, build, its, locomotives, and, the, rainhill, trials, were, run, in, october, 1829, entries, could, weigh, no, more, than, six, tons, and, had, to, travel, along, the, track, for, a, total, distance, of, 60, miles, 97, km, stephenson, s, entry, was, rocket, and, its, performance, in, winning, the, contest, made, it, famous, george, s, son, robert, had, been, working, in, south, america, from, 1824, to, 1827, and, returned, to, run, the, forth, street, works, while, george, was, in, liverpool, overseeing, the, construction, of, the, line, robert, was, responsible, for, the, detailed, design, of, rocket, although, he, was, in, constant, postal, communication, with, his, father, who, made, many, suggestions, one, significant, innovation, suggested, by, henry, booth, treasurer, of, the, l, mr, was, the, use, of, a, fire, tube, boiler, invented, by, french, engineer, marc, seguin, that, gave, improved, heat, exchange, the, opening, ceremony, of, the, l, mr, on, 15, september, 1830, drew, luminaries, from, the, government, and, industry, including, the, prime, minister, the, duke, of, wellington, the, day, started, with, a, procession, of, eight, trains, setting, out, from, liverpool, the, parade, was, led, by, northumbrian, driven, by, george, stephenson, and, included, phoenix, driven, by, his, son, robert, north, star, driven, by, his, brother, robert, and, rocket, driven, by, assistant, engineer, joseph, locke, the, day, was, marred, by, the, death, of, william, huskisson, the, member, of, parliament, for, liverpool, who, was, struck, by, rocket, stephenson, evacuated, the, injured, huskisson, to, eccles, with, a, train, but, he, died, from, his, injuries, despite, the, tragedy, the, railway, was, a, resounding, success, stephenson, became, famous, and, was, offered, the, position, of, chief, engineer, for, a, wide, variety, of, other, railways, 1830, also, saw, the, grand, opening, of, the, skew, bridge, in, rainhill, over, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, the, bridge, was, the, first, to, cross, any, railway, at, an, angle, it, required, the, structure, to, be, constructed, as, two, flat, planes, overlapping, in, this, case, by, 6, ft, 1, 8, m, between, which, the, stonework, forms, a, parallelogram, shape, when, viewed, from, above, it, has, the, effect, of, flattening, the, arch, and, the, solution, is, to, lay, the, bricks, forming, the, arch, at, an, angle, to, the, abutments, the, piers, on, which, the, arches, rest, the, technique, which, results, in, a, spiral, effect, in, the, arch, masonry, provides, extra, strength, in, the, arch, to, compensate, for, the, angled, abutments, the, bridge, is, still, in, use, at, rainhill, station, and, carries, traffic, on, the, a57, warrington, road, the, bridge, is, a, listed, structure, george, stephenson, moved, to, the, parish, of, alton, grange, now, part, of, ravenstone, in, leicestershire, in, 1830, originally, to, consult, on, the, leicester, and, swannington, railway, a, line, primarily, proposed, to, take, coal, from, the, western, coal, fields, of, the, county, to, leicester, the, promoters, of, the, line, mr, william, stenson, and, mr, john, ellis, had, difficulties, in, raising, the, necessary, capital, as, the, majority, of, local, wealth, had, been, invested, in, canals, realising, the, potential, and, need, for, the, rail, link, stephenson, himself, invested, 2, 500, and, raised, the, remaining, capital, through, his, network, of, connections, in, liverpool, his, son, robert, was, made, chief, engineer, with, the, first, part, of, the, line, opening, in, 1832, during, this, same, period, the, snibston, estate, in, leicestershire, came, up, for, auction, it, lay, adjoining, the, proposed, swannington, to, leicester, route, and, was, believed, to, contain, valuable, coal, reserves, stephenson, realising, the, financial, potential, of, the, site, given, its, proximity, to, the, proposed, rail, link, and, the, fact, that, the, manufacturing, town, of, leicester, was, then, being, supplied, coal, by, canal, from, derbyshire, bought, the, estate, employing, a, previously, used, method, of, mining, in, the, midlands, called, tubbing, to, access, the, deep, coal, seams, his, success, could, not, have, been, greater, stephenson, s, coal, mine, delivered, the, first, rail, cars, of, coal, into, leicester, dramatically, reducing, the, price, of, coal, and, saving, the, city, some, 40, 000, per, annum, stephenson, remained, at, alton, grange, until, 1838, before, moving, to, tapton, house, in, derbyshire, the, next, ten, years, were, the, busiest, of, stephenson, s, life, as, he, was, besieged, with, requests, from, railway, promoters, many, of, the, first, american, railroad, builders, came, to, newcastle, to, learn, from, stephenson, and, the, first, dozen, or, so, locomotives, utilised, there, were, purchased, from, the, stephenson, shops, stephenson, s, conservative, views, on, the, capabilities, of, locomotives, meant, he, favoured, circuitous, routes, and, civil, engineering, that, were, more, costly, than, his, successors, thought, necessary, for, example, rather, than, the, west, coast, main, line, taking, the, direct, route, favoured, by, joseph, locke, over, shap, between, lancaster, and, carlisle, stephenson, was, in, favour, of, a, longer, sea, level, route, via, ulverston, and, whitehaven, locke, s, route, was, built, stephenson, tended, to, be, more, casual, in, estimating, costs, and, paperwork, in, general, he, worked, with, joseph, locke, on, the, grand, junction, railway, with, half, of, the, line, allocated, to, each, man, stephenson, s, estimates, and, organising, ability, proved, inferior, to, those, of, locke, and, the, board, s, dissatisfaction, led, to, stephenson, s, resignation, causing, a, rift, between, them, which, was, never, healed, despite, stephenson, s, loss, of, some, routes, to, competitors, due, to, his, caution, he, was, offered, more, work, than, he, could, cope, with, and, was, unable, to, accept, all, that, was, offered, he, worked, on, the, north, midland, line, from, derby, to, leeds, the, york, and, north, midland, line, from, normanton, to, york, the, manchester, and, leeds, the, birmingham, and, derby, the, sheffield, and, rotherham, among, many, others, stephenson, became, a, reassuring, name, rather, than, a, cutting, edge, technical, adviser, he, was, the, first, president, of, the, institution, of, mechanical, engineers, on, its, formation, in, 1847, by, this, time, he, had, settled, into, semi, retirement, supervising, his, mining, interests, in, derbyshire, tunnelling, for, the, north, midland, railway, revealed, coal, seams, and, stephenson, put, money, into, their, exploitation, george, first, courted, elizabeth, betty, hindmarsh, a, farmer, s, daughter, from, black, callerton, whom, he, met, secretly, in, her, orchard, her, father, refused, marriage, because, of, stephenson, s, lowly, status, as, a, miner, george, next, paid, attention, to, anne, henderson, where, he, lodged, with, her, family, but, she, rejected, him, and, he, transferred, his, attentions, to, her, sister, frances, fanny, who, was, nine, years, his, senior, george, and, fanny, married, at, newburn, church, on, 28, november, 1802, they, had, two, children, robert, 1803, and, fanny, 1805, but, the, latter, died, within, months, george, s, wife, died, probably, of, tuberculosis, the, year, after, while, george, was, working, in, scotland, robert, was, brought, up, by, a, succession, of, neighbours, and, then, by, george, s, unmarried, sister, eleanor, nelly, who, lived, with, them, in, killingworth, on, george, s, return, on, 29, march, 1820, george, now, considerably, wealthier, married, betty, hindmarsh, at, newburn, the, marriage, seems, to, have, been, happy, but, there, were, no, children, and, betty, died, on, 3, august, 1845, on, 11, january, 1848, at, st, john, s, church, in, shrewsbury, shropshire, george, married, for, the, third, time, to, ellen, gregory, another, farmer, s, daughter, originally, from, bakewell, in, derbyshire, who, had, been, his, housekeeper, seven, months, after, his, wedding, george, contracted, pleurisy, and, died, aged, 67, at, noon, on, saturday, 12, august, 1848, at, tapton, house, in, chesterfield, derbyshire, he, was, buried, at, holy, trinity, church, chesterfield, alongside, his, second, wife, described, by, rolt, as, a, generous, man, stephenson, financially, supported, the, wives, and, families, of, several, who, had, died, in, his, employment, due, to, accident, or, misadventure, some, within, his, family, and, some, not, he, was, also, a, keen, gardener, throughout, his, life, during, his, last, years, at, tapton, house, he, built, hothouses, in, the, estate, gardens, growing, exotic, fruits, and, vegetables, in, a, not, too, friendly, rivalry, with, joseph, paxton, head, gardener, at, nearby, chatsworth, house, twice, beating, the, master, of, the, craft, george, stephenson, had, two, children, his, son, robert, was, born, on, 16, october, 1803, robert, married, frances, sanderson, daughter, of, a, city, of, london, professional, john, sanderson, on, 17, june, 1829, robert, died, in, 1859, having, no, children, robert, stephenson, expanded, on, the, work, of, his, father, and, became, a, major, railway, engineer, himself, abroad, robert, was, involved, in, the, alexandria, cairo, railway, that, later, connected, with, the, suez, canal, george, stephenson, s, daughter, was, born, in, 1805, but, died, within, weeks, of, her, birth, descendants, of, the, wider, stephenson, family, continue, to, live, in, wylam, stephenson, s, birthplace, today, also, relatives, connected, by, his, marriage, live, in, derbyshire, some, descendants, later, emigrated, to, perth, australia,
