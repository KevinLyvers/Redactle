nagarjuna, sanskrit, n, g, rjuna, c, 150, c, 250, ce, was, an, indian, monk, and, mah, y, na, buddhist, philosopher, of, the, madhyamaka, centrism, middle, way, school, he, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, important, buddhist, philosophers, jan, westerhoff, considers, him, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, thinkers, in, the, history, of, asian, philosophy, n, g, rjuna, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, founder, of, the, madhyamaka, school, of, buddhist, philosophy, and, a, defender, of, the, mah, y, na, movement, his, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, root, verses, on, madhyamaka, mmk, is, the, most, important, text, on, the, madhyamaka, philosophy, of, emptiness, the, mmk, inspired, a, large, number, of, commentaries, in, sanskrit, chinese, tibetan, korean, and, japanese, and, continues, to, be, studied, today, india, in, the, first, and, second, centuries, ce, was, politically, divided, into, various, states, including, the, kushan, empire, and, the, satavahana, kingdom, at, this, point, in, buddhist, history, the, buddhist, community, was, already, divided, into, various, buddhist, schools, and, had, spread, throughout, india, at, this, time, there, was, already, a, small, and, nascent, mah, y, na, movement, mah, y, na, ideas, were, held, by, a, minority, of, buddhists, in, india, at, the, time, as, joseph, walser, writes, mah, y, na, before, the, fifth, century, was, largely, invisible, and, probably, existed, only, as, a, minority, and, largely, unrecognized, movement, within, the, fold, of, nik, ya, buddhism, by, the, second, century, early, mah, y, na, s, tras, such, as, the, a, as, hasrik, praj, p, ramit, were, already, circulating, among, certain, mah, y, na, circles, very, little, is, reliably, known, of, the, life, of, n, g, rjuna, and, modern, historians, do, not, agree, on, a, specific, date, 1st, to, 3rd, century, ce, or, place, multiple, places, in, india, suggested, for, him, the, earliest, surviving, accounts, were, written, in, chinese, and, tibetan, centuries, after, his, death, and, are, mostly, hagiographical, accounts, that, are, historically, unverifiable, some, scholars, such, as, joseph, walser, argue, that, n, g, rjuna, was, an, advisor, to, a, king, of, the, s, tav, hana, dynasty, which, ruled, the, deccan, plateau, in, the, second, century, this, is, supported, by, most, of, the, traditional, hagiographical, sources, as, well, archaeological, evidence, at, amar, vat, indicates, that, if, this, is, true, the, king, may, have, been, yaj, a, r, takar, i, c, second, half, of, the, 2nd, century, on, the, basis, of, this, association, n, g, rjuna, is, conventionally, placed, at, around, 150, 250, ce, walser, thinks, that, it, is, most, likely, that, when, n, g, rjuna, wrote, the, ratnavali, he, lived, in, a, mixed, monastery, with, mah, y, nists, and, non, mah, y, nists, in, which, mah, y, nists, were, the, minority, the, most, likely, sectarian, affiliation, of, the, monastery, according, to, walser, was, purvasailya, aparasailya, or, caityaka, which, were, mah, s, ghika, sub, schools, he, also, argues, that, it, is, plausible, that, he, wrote, the, ratnavali, within, a, thirty, year, period, at, the, end, of, the, second, century, in, the, andhra, region, around, dhanyakataka, modern, day, amaravati, according, to, walser, the, earliest, extant, legends, about, n, g, rjuna, are, compiled, into, kum, raj, va, s, biography, of, n, g, rjuna, which, he, translated, into, chinese, in, about, 405, ce, according, to, this, biography, n, g, rjuna, was, born, into, a, brahmin, family, and, later, became, a, buddhist, the, traditional, religious, hagiographies, place, n, g, rjuna, in, various, regions, of, india, kum, raj, va, and, candrakirti, place, him, in, vidarbha, region, of, south, india, xuanzang, in, south, kosala, traditional, religious, hagiographies, credit, n, g, rjuna, with, being, associated, with, the, teaching, of, the, praj, p, ramit, s, tras, as, well, as, with, having, revealed, these, scriptures, to, the, world, after, they, had, remained, hidden, for, some, time, the, sources, differ, on, where, this, happened, and, how, n, g, rjuna, retrieved, the, sutras, some, sources, say, he, retrieved, the, sutras, from, the, land, of, the, n, gas, n, g, rjuna, himself, is, often, depicted, in, composite, form, comprising, human, and, n, ga, characteristics, n, gas, are, snake, like, supernatural, beings, of, great, magical, power, that, feature, in, hindu, buddhist, and, jain, mythology, n, gas, are, found, throughout, indian, religious, culture, and, typically, signify, intelligent, serpents, or, dragons, that, are, responsible, for, rain, lakes, and, other, bodies, of, water, in, buddhism, a, naga, can, be, a, symbol, of, a, realised, arhat, or, wise, person, traditional, sources, also, claim, that, n, g, rjuna, practised, ayurvedic, alchemy, rasay, na, kum, raj, va, s, biography, for, example, has, n, g, rjuna, making, an, elixir, of, invisibility, and, bus, ton, taranatha, and, xuanzang, all, state, that, he, could, turn, rocks, into, gold, tibetan, hagiographies, also, state, that, n, g, rjuna, studied, at, n, landa, university, however, according, to, walser, this, university, was, not, a, strong, monastic, center, until, about, 425, also, as, walser, notes, xuanzang, and, yijing, both, spent, considerable, time, at, n, landa, and, studied, n, g, rjuna, s, texts, there, it, is, strange, that, they, would, have, spent, so, much, time, there, and, yet, chose, not, to, report, any, local, tales, of, a, man, whose, works, played, such, an, important, part, in, the, curriculum, some, sources, bu, ston, and, the, other, tibetan, historians, claim, that, in, his, later, years, n, g, rjuna, lived, on, the, mountain, of, r, parvata, near, the, city, that, would, later, be, called, n, g, rjunako, a, hill, of, n, g, rjuna, the, ruins, of, n, g, rjunako, a, are, located, in, guntur, district, andhra, pradesh, the, caitika, and, bahu, rut, ya, nik, yas, are, known, to, have, had, monasteries, in, n, g, rjunako, a, the, archaeological, finds, at, n, g, rjunako, a, have, not, resulted, in, any, evidence, that, the, site, was, associated, with, nagarjuna, the, name, n, g, rjunako, a, dates, from, the, medieval, period, and, the, 3rd, 4th, century, inscriptions, found, at, the, site, make, it, clear, that, it, was, known, as, vijayapuri, in, the, ancient, period, there, are, a, multitude, of, texts, attributed, to, n, g, rjuna, many, of, these, texts, date, from, much, later, periods, this, has, caused, much, confusion, for, the, traditional, buddhist, biographers, and, doxographers, modern, scholars, are, divided, on, how, to, classify, these, later, texts, and, how, many, later, writers, called, n, g, rjuna, existed, the, name, remains, popular, today, in, andhra, pradesh, some, scholars, have, posited, that, there, was, a, separate, aryuvedic, writer, called, n, g, rjuna, who, wrote, numerous, treatises, on, rasayana, also, there, is, a, later, tantric, buddhist, author, by, the, same, name, who, may, have, been, a, scholar, at, n, land, university, and, wrote, on, buddhist, tantra, according, to, donald, s, lopez, jr, he, originally, belonged, to, a, brahmin, family, from, eastern, india, and, later, became, buddhist, there, is, also, a, jain, figure, of, the, same, name, who, was, said, to, have, travelled, to, the, himalayas, walser, thinks, that, it, is, possible, that, stories, related, to, this, figure, influenced, buddhist, legends, as, well, religion, portal, there, exist, a, number, of, influential, texts, attributed, to, n, g, rjuna, however, as, there, are, many, pseudepigrapha, attributed, to, him, lively, controversy, exists, over, which, are, his, authentic, works, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, is, n, g, rjuna, s, best, known, work, it, is, not, only, a, grand, commentary, on, the, buddha, s, discourse, to, kaccayana, the, only, discourse, cited, by, name, but, also, a, detailed, and, careful, analysis, of, most, of, the, important, discourses, included, in, the, nikayas, and, the, agamas, especially, those, of, the, atthakavagga, of, the, sutta, nipata, utilizing, the, buddha, s, theory, of, dependent, arising, pratitya, samutpada, nagarjuna, demonstrated, the, futility, of, metaphysical, speculations, his, method, of, dealing, with, such, metaphysics, is, referred, to, as, middle, way, madhyama, pratipad, it, is, the, middle, way, that, avoided, the, substantialism, of, the, sarvastivadins, as, well, as, the, nominalism, of, the, sautrantikas, in, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, ll, experienced, phenomena, are, empty, sunya, this, did, not, mean, that, they, are, not, experienced, and, therefore, non, existent, only, that, they, are, devoid, of, a, permanent, and, eternal, substance, svabhava, because, like, a, dream, they, are, mere, projections, of, human, consciousness, since, these, imaginary, fictions, are, experienced, they, are, not, mere, names, prajnapti, according, to, david, seyfort, ruegg, the, madhyamakasastrastuti, attributed, to, candrakirti, c, 600, c, 650, refers, to, eight, texts, by, nagarjuna, the, madhyamaka, karikas, the, yuktisastika, the, sunyatasaptati, the, vigrahavyavartani, the, vidala, i, e, vaidalyasutra, vaidalyaprakarana, the, ratnavali, the, sutrasamuccaya, and, samstutis, hymns, this, list, covers, not, only, much, less, than, the, grand, total, of, works, ascribed, to, nagarjuna, in, the, chinese, and, tibetan, collections, but, it, does, not, even, include, all, such, works, that, candrakirti, has, himself, cited, in, his, writings, according, to, one, view, that, of, christian, lindtner, the, works, definitely, written, by, n, g, rjuna, are, other, scholars, have, challenged, and, argued, against, some, of, the, above, works, being, nagarjuna, s, david, f, burton, notes, that, christian, lindtner, is, rather, liberal, with, his, list, of, works, and, that, other, scholars, have, called, some, of, these, into, question, he, notes, how, paul, williams, argued, convincingly, that, the, bodhicittavivara, a, must, be, a, later, text, in, his, study, burton, relies, on, the, texts, that, he, considers, least, controversial, m, lamadhyamaka, k, rik, vigrahavy, vartan, nyat, saptati, yukti, ika, catu, stava, vaidalyaprakara, a, and, ratn, val, similarly, jan, westerhoff, notes, how, there, is, uncertainty, about, the, attribution, of, nagarjuna, s, works, and, about, his, life, in, general, he, relies, on, six, works, mmk, vigrahavy, vartan, nyat, saptati, yukti, ika, vaidalyaprakara, a, and, ratn, val, all, of, which, expound, a, single, coherent, philosophical, system, and, are, attributed, to, nagarjuna, by, a, variety, of, indian, and, tibetan, sources, the, tibetan, historian, buston, considers, the, first, six, to, be, the, main, treatises, of, n, g, rjuna, this, is, called, the, yukti, corpus, rigs, chogs, while, according, to, t, ran, tha, only, the, first, five, are, the, works, of, n, g, rjuna, trv, murti, considers, ratn, val, prat, tyasamutp, dah, daya, and, s, trasamuccaya, to, be, works, of, n, g, rjuna, as, the, first, two, are, quoted, profusely, by, chandrakirti, and, the, third, by, shantideva, in, addition, to, works, mentioned, above, numerous, other, works, are, attributed, to, n, g, rjuna, many, of, which, are, dubious, attributions, and, later, works, there, is, an, ongoing, lively, controversy, over, which, of, those, works, are, authentic, christian, lindtner, divides, the, various, attributed, works, as, 1, correctly, attributed, 2, wrongly, attributed, to, him, and, 3, those, which, may, or, may, not, be, genuine, lindtner, further, divides, the, third, category, of, dubious, or, questionable, texts, into, those, which, are, perhaps, authentic, and, those, who, are, unlikely, to, be, authentic, those, which, he, sees, as, perhaps, being, authentic, include, ruegg, notes, various, works, of, uncertain, authorship, which, have, been, attributed, to, nagarjuna, including, the, dharmadhatustava, hymn, to, the, dharmadhatu, which, shows, later, influences, mahayanavimsika, salistambakarikas, the, bhavasamkranti, and, the, dasabhumtkavibh, s, furthermore, ruegg, writes, that, three, collections, of, stanzas, on, the, virtues, of, intelligence, and, moral, conduct, ascribed, to, nagarjuna, are, extant, in, tibetan, translation, praj, asatakaprakarana, nitisastra, jantuposanabindu, and, niti, sastra, praj, adanda, meanwhile, those, texts, that, lindtner, considers, as, questionable, and, likely, inauthentic, are, aksarasataka, akutobhaya, mulamadhyamakavrtti, aryabhattaraka, manjusriparamarthastuti, kayatrayastotra, narakoddharastava, niruttarastava, vandanastava, dharmasamgraha, dharmadhatugarbhavivarana, ekaslokasastra, isvarakartrtvanirakrtih, a, refutation, of, god, isvara, sattvaradhanastava, upayahrdaya, astadasasunyatasastra, dharmadhatustava, yogaratnamala, meanwhile, lindtner, s, list, of, outright, wrong, attributions, is, mah, praj, p, ramitopade, a, d, zh, d, l, n, abudhabodhakaprakarana, guhyasamajatantratika, dvadasadvaraka, praj, aparamitastotra, and, svabhavatrayapravesasiddhi, notably, the, d, zh, d, l, n, taisho, 1509, commentary, on, the, great, praj, aparamita, which, has, been, influential, in, chinese, buddhism, has, been, questioned, as, a, genuine, work, of, n, g, rjuna, by, various, scholars, including, lamotte, this, work, is, also, only, attested, in, a, chinese, translation, by, kum, raj, va, and, is, unknown, in, the, tibetan, and, indian, traditions, other, works, are, extant, only, in, chinese, one, of, these, is, the, shih, erh, men, lun, or, twelve, topic, treatise, dvadasanikaya, or, dvadasamukha, sastra, one, of, the, three, basic, treatises, of, the, sanlun, school, east, asian, madhyamaka, several, works, considered, important, in, esoteric, buddhism, are, attributed, to, n, g, rjuna, and, his, disciples, by, traditional, historians, like, t, ran, tha, from, 17th, century, tibet, these, historians, try, to, account, for, chronological, difficulties, with, various, theories, such, as, seeing, later, writings, as, mystical, revelations, for, a, useful, summary, of, this, tradition, see, wedemeyer, 2007, lindtner, sees, the, author, of, some, of, these, tantric, works, as, being, a, tantric, nagarjuna, who, lives, much, later, sometimes, called, nagarjuna, ii, n, g, rjuna, s, major, thematic, focus, is, the, concept, of, nyat, translated, into, english, as, emptiness, which, brings, together, other, key, buddhist, doctrines, particularly, an, tman, not, self, and, prat, tyasamutp, da, dependent, origination, to, refute, the, metaphysics, of, some, of, his, contemporaries, for, n, g, rjuna, as, for, the, buddha, in, the, early, texts, it, is, not, merely, sentient, beings, that, are, selfless, or, non, substantial, all, phenomena, dhammas, are, without, any, svabh, va, literally, own, being, self, nature, or, inherent, existence, and, thus, without, any, underlying, essence, they, are, empty, of, being, independently, existent, thus, the, heterodox, theories, of, svabh, va, circulating, at, the, time, were, refuted, on, the, basis, of, the, doctrines, of, early, buddhism, this, is, so, because, all, things, arise, always, dependently, not, by, their, own, power, but, by, depending, on, conditions, leading, to, their, coming, into, existence, as, opposed, to, being, n, g, rjuna, means, by, real, any, entity, which, has, a, nature, of, its, own, svabh, va, which, is, not, produced, by, causes, akrtaka, which, is, not, dependent, on, anything, else, paratra, nirapeksha, chapter, 24, verse, 14, of, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, provides, one, of, n, g, rjuna, s, most, famous, quotations, on, emptiness, and, co, arising, sarva, ca, yujyate, tasya, nyat, yasya, yujyate, sarva, na, yujyate, tasya, nya, yasya, na, yujyate, all, is, possible, when, emptiness, is, possible, nothing, is, possible, when, emptiness, is, impossible, as, part, of, his, analysis, of, the, emptiness, of, phenomena, in, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, n, g, rjuna, critiques, svabh, va, in, several, different, concepts, he, discusses, the, problems, of, positing, any, sort, of, inherent, essence, to, causation, movement, change, and, personal, identity, n, g, rjuna, makes, use, of, the, indian, logical, tool, of, the, tetralemma, to, attack, any, essentialist, conceptions, n, g, rjuna, s, logical, analysis, is, based, on, four, basic, propositions, to, say, that, all, things, are, empty, is, to, deny, any, kind, of, ontological, foundation, therefore, n, g, rjuna, s, view, is, often, seen, as, a, kind, of, ontological, anti, foundationalism, or, a, metaphysical, anti, realism, understanding, the, nature, of, the, emptiness, of, phenomena, is, simply, a, means, to, an, end, which, is, nirvana, thus, n, g, rjuna, s, philosophical, project, is, ultimately, a, soteriological, one, meant, to, correct, our, everyday, cognitive, processes, which, mistakenly, posits, svabh, va, on, the, flow, of, experience, some, scholars, such, as, fyodor, shcherbatskoy, and, t, r, v, murti, held, that, n, g, rjuna, was, the, inventor, of, the, shunyata, doctrine, however, more, recent, work, by, scholars, such, as, choong, mun, keat, yin, shun, and, dhammajothi, thero, has, argued, that, n, g, rjuna, was, not, an, innovator, by, putting, forth, this, theory, but, that, in, the, words, of, shi, huifeng, the, connection, between, emptiness, and, dependent, origination, is, not, an, innovation, or, creation, of, n, g, rjuna, n, g, rjuna, was, also, instrumental, in, the, development, of, the, two, truths, doctrine, which, claims, that, there, are, two, levels, of, truth, in, buddhist, teaching, the, ultimate, truth, param, rtha, satya, and, the, conventional, or, superficial, truth, sa, v, tisatya, the, ultimate, truth, to, n, g, rjuna, is, the, truth, that, everything, is, empty, of, essence, this, includes, emptiness, itself, the, emptiness, of, emptiness, while, some, murti, 1955, have, interpreted, this, by, positing, n, g, rjuna, as, a, neo, kantian, and, thus, making, ultimate, truth, a, metaphysical, noumenon, or, an, ineffable, ultimate, that, transcends, the, capacities, of, discursive, reason, others, such, as, mark, siderits, and, jay, l, garfield, have, argued, that, n, g, rjuna, s, view, is, that, the, ultimate, truth, is, that, there, is, no, ultimate, truth, siderits, and, that, n, g, rjuna, is, a, semantic, anti, dualist, who, posits, that, there, are, only, conventional, truths, hence, according, to, garfield, suppose, that, we, take, a, conventional, entity, such, as, a, table, we, analyze, it, to, demonstrate, its, emptiness, finding, that, there, is, no, table, apart, from, its, parts, so, we, conclude, that, it, is, empty, but, now, let, us, analyze, that, emptiness, what, do, we, find, nothing, at, all, but, the, table, s, lack, of, inherent, existence, to, see, the, table, as, empty, is, to, see, the, table, as, conventional, as, dependent, in, articulating, this, notion, in, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, n, g, rjuna, drew, on, an, early, source, in, the, kacc, nagotta, sutta, which, distinguishes, definitive, meaning, n, t, rtha, from, interpretable, meaning, ney, rtha, by, and, large, kaccayana, this, world, is, supported, by, a, polarity, that, of, existence, and, non, existence, but, when, one, reads, the, origination, of, the, world, as, it, actually, is, with, right, discernment, non, existence, with, reference, to, the, world, does, not, occur, to, one, when, one, reads, the, cessation, of, the, world, as, it, actually, is, with, right, discernment, existence, with, reference, to, the, world, does, not, occur, to, one, by, and, large, kaccayana, this, world, is, in, bondage, to, attachments, clingings, sustenances, and, biases, but, one, such, as, this, does, not, get, involved, with, or, cling, to, these, attachments, clingings, fixations, of, awareness, biases, or, obsessions, nor, is, he, resolved, on, my, self, he, has, no, uncertainty, or, doubt, that, just, stress, when, arising, is, arising, stress, when, passing, away, is, passing, away, in, this, his, knowledge, is, independent, of, others, it, s, to, this, extent, kaccayana, that, there, is, right, view, everything, exists, that, is, one, extreme, everything, doesn, t, exist, that, is, a, second, extreme, avoiding, these, two, extremes, the, tathagata, teaches, the, dhamma, via, the, middle, the, version, linked, to, is, the, one, found, in, the, nikayas, and, is, slightly, different, from, the, one, found, in, the, samyuktagama, both, contain, the, concept, of, teaching, via, the, middle, between, the, extremes, of, existence, and, non, existence, nagarjuna, does, not, make, reference, to, everything, when, he, quotes, the, agamic, text, in, his, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, jay, l, garfield, describes, that, n, g, rjuna, approached, causality, from, the, four, noble, truths, and, dependent, origination, n, g, rjuna, distinguished, two, dependent, origination, views, in, a, causal, process, that, which, causes, effects, and, that, which, causes, conditions, this, is, predicated, in, the, two, truth, doctrine, as, conventional, truth, and, ultimate, truth, held, together, in, which, both, are, empty, in, existence, the, distinction, between, effects, and, conditions, is, controversial, in, n, g, rjuna, s, approach, cause, means, an, event, or, state, that, has, power, to, bring, an, effect, conditions, refer, to, proliferating, causes, that, bring, a, further, event, state, or, process, without, a, metaphysical, commitment, to, an, occult, connection, between, explaining, and, explanans, he, argues, nonexistent, causes, and, various, existing, conditions, the, argument, draws, from, unreal, causal, power, things, conventional, exist, and, are, ultimately, nonexistent, to, rest, in, the, middle, way, in, both, causal, existence, and, nonexistence, as, casual, emptiness, within, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, doctrine, although, seeming, strange, to, westerners, this, is, seen, as, an, attack, on, a, reified, view, of, causality, n, g, rjuna, also, taught, the, idea, of, relativity, in, the, ratn, val, he, gives, the, example, that, shortness, exists, only, in, relation, to, the, idea, of, length, the, determination, of, a, thing, or, object, is, only, possible, in, relation, to, other, things, or, objects, especially, by, way, of, contrast, he, held, that, the, relationship, between, the, ideas, of, short, and, long, is, not, due, to, intrinsic, nature, svabh, va, this, idea, is, also, found, in, the, pali, nik, yas, and, chinese, gamas, in, which, the, idea, of, relativity, is, expressed, similarly, that, which, is, the, element, of, light, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, darkness, that, which, is, the, element, of, good, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, bad, that, which, is, the, element, of, space, is, seen, to, exist, on, account, of, form, n, g, rjuna, was, fully, acquainted, with, the, classical, hindu, philosophies, of, samkhya, and, even, the, vaiseshika, n, g, rjuna, assumes, a, knowledge, of, the, definitions, of, the, sixteen, categories, as, given, in, the, nyaya, sutras, the, chief, text, of, the, hindu, nyaya, school, and, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, pramanas, where, he, reduced, the, syllogism, of, five, members, into, one, of, three, in, the, vigrahavyavartani, karika, n, g, rjuna, criticises, the, nyaya, theory, of, pramanas, means, of, knowledge, n, g, rjuna, was, conversant, with, many, of, the, r, vaka, philosophies, and, with, the, mah, y, na, tradition, however, determining, n, g, rjuna, s, affiliation, with, a, specific, nik, ya, is, difficult, considering, much, of, this, material, has, been, lost, if, the, most, commonly, accepted, attribution, of, texts, that, of, christian, lindtner, holds, then, he, was, clearly, a, m, hay, nist, but, his, philosophy, holds, assiduously, to, the, r, vaka, tripi, aka, and, while, he, does, make, explicit, references, to, mah, y, na, texts, he, is, always, careful, to, stay,
