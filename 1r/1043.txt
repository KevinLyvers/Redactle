alcibiades, l, s, b, a, d, i, z, al, sib, eye, deez, greek, c, 450, 404, bc, was, an, athenian, statesman, and, general, the, last, of, the, alcmaeonidae, he, played, a, major, role, in, the, second, half, of, the, peloponnesian, war, as, a, strategic, advisor, military, commander, and, politician, but, subsequently, fell, from, prominence, during, the, course, of, the, peloponnesian, war, alcibiades, changed, his, political, allegiance, several, times, in, his, native, athens, in, the, early, 410s, bc, he, advocated, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, and, was, a, prominent, proponent, of, the, sicilian, expedition, after, his, political, enemies, brought, charges, of, sacrilege, against, him, he, fled, to, sparta, where, he, served, as, a, strategic, adviser, proposing, or, supervising, several, major, campaigns, against, athens, however, alcibiades, made, powerful, enemies, in, sparta, too, and, defected, to, persia, there, he, served, as, an, adviser, to, the, satrap, tissaphernes, until, athenian, political, allies, brought, about, his, recall, he, served, as, an, athenian, general, strategos, for, several, years, but, enemies, eventually, succeeded, in, exiling, him, a, second, time, scholars, have, argued, that, had, the, sicilian, expedition, been, under, alcibiades, s, command, instead, of, that, of, nicias, the, expedition, might, not, have, met, its, eventual, disastrous, fate, in, the, years, when, he, served, sparta, alcibiades, played, a, significant, role, in, athens, s, undoing, the, capture, of, decelea, and, the, revolts, of, several, critical, athenian, subjects, occurred, either, at, his, suggestion, or, under, his, supervision, once, restored, to, his, native, city, however, he, played, a, crucial, role, in, a, string, of, athenian, victories, that, eventually, brought, sparta, to, seek, a, peace, with, athens, he, favored, unconventional, tactics, frequently, winning, cities, over, by, treachery, or, negotiation, rather, than, by, siege, alcibiades, s, military, and, political, talents, frequently, proved, valuable, to, whichever, state, currently, held, his, allegiance, but, his, propensity, for, making, powerful, enemies, ensured, that, he, never, remained, in, one, place, for, long, and, by, the, end, of, the, war, that, he, had, helped, to, rekindle, in, the, early, 410s, his, days, of, political, relevance, were, a, bygone, memory, alcibiades, was, born, in, athens, the, family, of, his, father, cleinias, had, old, connections, with, the, spartan, aristocracy, through, a, relationship, of, xenia, and, the, name, alcibiades, was, of, spartan, origin, alcibiades, mother, was, deinomache, the, daughter, of, megacles, head, of, the, powerful, alcmaeonid, family, and, could, trace, her, family, back, to, eurysaces, and, the, telamonian, ajax, alcibiades, thereby, through, his, mother, belonged, to, the, powerful, and, controversial, family, of, the, alcmaeonidae, the, renowned, pericles, and, his, brother, ariphron, were, deinomache, s, cousins, as, her, father, and, their, mother, were, siblings, his, paternal, grandfather, also, named, alcibiades, was, a, friend, of, cleisthenes, the, famous, constitutional, reformer, of, the, late, sixth, century, bc, after, the, death, of, cleinias, at, the, battle, of, coronea, 447, bc, pericles, and, ariphron, became, his, guardians, according, to, plutarch, alcibiades, had, several, famous, teachers, including, socrates, and, was, well, trained, in, the, art, of, rhetoric, he, was, noted, however, for, his, unruly, behavior, which, was, mentioned, by, ancient, greek, and, latin, writers, on, several, occasions, it, was, believed, that, socrates, took, alcibiades, as, a, student, because, he, believed, he, could, change, alcibiades, from, his, vain, ways, xenophon, attempted, to, clear, socrates, s, name, at, trial, by, relaying, information, that, alcibiades, was, always, corrupt, and, that, socrates, merely, failed, in, attempting, to, teach, him, morality, alcibiades, took, part, in, the, battle, of, potidaea, in, 432, bc, where, socrates, was, said, to, have, saved, his, life, alcibiades, later, returned, the, favour, by, rescuing, socrates, at, the, battle, of, delium, in, 424, bc, alcibiades, had, a, particularly, close, relationship, with, socrates, whom, he, admired, and, respected, plutarch, and, plato, describe, alcibiades, as, socrates, s, beloved, the, former, stating, that, alcibiades, feared, and, reverenced, socrates, alone, and, despised, the, rest, of, his, lovers, alcibiades, was, married, to, hipparete, the, daughter, of, hipponicus, a, wealthy, athenian, his, bride, brought, with, her, a, large, dowry, which, significantly, increased, alcibiades, already, substantial, family, fortune, according, to, plutarch, hipparete, loved, her, husband, but, attempted, to, divorce, him, because, he, consorted, with, courtesans, but, he, prevented, her, from, appearing, at, court, he, seized, her, in, court, and, carried, her, home, again, through, the, crowded, agora, 185, she, lived, with, him, until, her, death, which, came, soon, after, and, gave, birth, to, two, children, a, son, named, alcibiades, the, younger, and, a, daughter, alcibiades, was, famed, throughout, his, life, for, his, physical, attractiveness, of, which, he, was, inordinately, vain, alcibiades, first, rose, to, prominence, when, he, began, advocating, aggressive, athenian, action, after, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, nicias, that, treaty, an, uneasy, truce, between, sparta, and, athens, signed, midway, through, the, peloponnesian, war, came, at, the, end, of, seven, years, of, fighting, during, which, neither, side, had, gained, a, decisive, advantage, historians, arnold, w, gomme, and, raphael, sealey, believe, and, thucydides, reports, that, alcibiades, was, offended, that, the, spartans, had, negotiated, that, treaty, through, nicias, and, laches, overlooking, him, on, account, of, his, youth, disputes, over, the, interpretation, of, the, treaty, led, the, spartans, to, dispatch, ambassadors, to, athens, with, full, powers, to, arrange, all, unsettled, matters, the, athenians, initially, received, these, ambassadors, well, but, alcibiades, met, with, them, in, secret, before, they, were, to, speak, to, the, ecclesia, the, athenian, assembly, and, told, them, that, the, assembly, was, haughty, and, had, great, ambitions, he, urged, them, to, renounce, their, diplomatic, authority, to, represent, sparta, and, instead, allow, him, to, assist, them, through, his, influence, in, athenian, politics, the, representatives, agreed, and, impressed, with, alcibiades, they, alienated, themselves, from, nicias, who, genuinely, wanted, to, reach, an, agreement, with, the, spartans, the, next, day, during, the, assembly, alcibiades, asked, them, what, powers, sparta, had, granted, them, to, negotiate, and, they, replied, as, agreed, that, they, had, not, come, with, full, and, independent, powers, this, was, in, direct, contradiction, to, what, they, had, said, the, day, before, and, alcibiades, seized, on, this, opportunity, to, denounce, their, character, cast, suspicion, on, their, aims, and, destroy, their, credibility, this, ploy, increased, alcibiades, s, standing, while, embarrassing, nicias, and, alcibiades, was, subsequently, appointed, general, he, took, advantage, of, his, increasing, power, to, orchestrate, the, creation, of, an, alliance, between, argos, mantinea, elis, and, other, states, in, the, peloponnese, threatening, sparta, s, dominance, in, the, region, according, to, gomme, it, was, a, grandiose, scheme, for, an, athenian, general, at, the, head, of, a, mainly, peloponnesian, army, to, march, through, the, peloponnese, cocking, a, snook, at, sparta, when, her, reputation, was, at, its, lowest, this, alliance, however, would, ultimately, be, defeated, at, the, battle, of, mantinea, somewhere, in, the, years, 416, 415, bc, a, complex, struggle, took, place, between, hyperbolos, on, one, side, and, nicias, and, alcibiades, on, the, other, hyperbolos, tried, to, bring, about, the, ostracism, of, one, of, this, pair, but, nicias, and, alcibiades, combined, their, influence, to, induce, the, people, to, expel, hyperbolos, instead, this, incident, reveals, that, nicias, and, alcibiades, each, commanded, a, personal, following, whose, votes, were, determined, by, the, wishes, of, the, leaders, alcibiades, was, not, one, of, the, generals, involved, in, the, capture, of, melos, in, 416, 415, bc, but, plutarch, describes, him, as, a, supporter, of, the, decree, by, which, the, grown, men, of, melos, were, killed, and, the, women, and, children, enslaved, an, oration, urging, alcibiades, ostracism, against, alcibiades, historically, attributed, to, the, orator, andocides, but, not, in, fact, by, him, alleges, that, alcibiades, had, a, child, by, one, of, these, enslaved, women, in, 415, bc, delegates, from, the, sicilian, city, of, segesta, greek, egesta, arrived, at, athens, to, plead, for, the, support, of, the, athenians, in, their, war, against, selinus, during, the, debates, on, the, undertaking, nicias, was, vehemently, opposed, to, athenian, intervention, explaining, that, the, campaign, would, be, very, costly, and, attacking, the, character, and, motives, of, alcibiades, who, had, emerged, as, a, major, supporter, of, the, expedition, on, the, other, hand, alcibiades, argued, that, a, campaign, in, this, new, theatre, would, bring, riches, to, the, city, and, expand, the, empire, just, as, the, persian, wars, had, in, his, speech, alcibiades, predicted, over, optimistically, in, the, opinion, of, most, historians, that, the, athenians, would, be, able, to, recruit, allies, in, the, region, and, impose, their, rule, on, syracuse, the, most, powerful, city, of, sicily, in, spite, of, alcibiades, s, enthusiastic, advocacy, for, the, plan, it, was, nicias, not, he, who, turned, a, modest, undertaking, into, a, massive, campaign, and, made, the, conquest, of, sicily, seem, possible, and, safe, it, was, at, his, suggestion, that, the, size, of, the, fleet, was, significantly, increased, from, 60, ships, to, 140, galleys, 5, 100, men, at, arms, and, about, 1300, archers, slingers, and, light, armed, men, philosopher, leo, strauss, underscores, that, the, sicilian, expedition, surpassed, everything, undertaken, by, pericles, almost, certainly, nicias, s, intention, was, to, shock, the, assembly, with, his, high, estimate, of, the, forces, required, but, instead, of, dissuading, his, fellow, citizens, his, analysis, made, them, all, the, more, eager, against, his, wishes, nicias, was, appointed, general, along, with, alcibiades, and, lamachus, all, three, of, whom, were, given, full, powers, to, do, whatever, was, in, the, best, interests, of, athens, while, in, sicily, one, night, during, preparations, for, the, expedition, the, hermai, heads, of, the, god, hermes, on, a, plinth, with, a, phallus, were, mutilated, throughout, athens, this, was, a, religious, scandal, resulted, in, a, charge, of, asebeia, impiety, against, alcibiades, and, was, seen, as, a, bad, omen, for, the, mission, plutarch, explains, that, androcles, a, political, leader, used, false, witnesses, who, accused, alcibiades, and, his, friends, of, mutilating, the, statues, and, of, profaning, the, eleusinian, mysteries, later, his, opponents, chief, among, them, being, androcles, and, thessalus, cimon, s, son, enlisted, orators, to, argue, that, alcibiades, should, set, sail, as, planned, and, stand, trial, on, his, return, from, the, campaign, alcibiades, was, suspicious, of, their, intentions, and, asked, to, be, allowed, to, stand, trial, immediately, under, penalty, of, death, in, order, to, clear, his, name, this, request, was, denied, and, the, fleet, set, sail, soon, after, with, the, charges, unresolved, as, alcibiades, had, suspected, his, absence, emboldened, his, enemies, and, they, began, to, accuse, him, of, other, sacrilegious, actions, and, comments, and, even, alleged, that, these, actions, were, connected, with, a, plot, against, the, democracy, according, to, thucydides, the, athenians, were, always, in, fear, and, took, everything, suspiciously, when, the, fleet, arrived, in, catania, it, found, the, state, trireme, salaminia, waiting, to, bring, alcibiades, and, the, others, indicted, for, mutilating, the, hermai, or, profaning, the, eleusinian, mysteries, back, to, athens, to, stand, trial, alcibiades, told, the, heralds, that, he, would, follow, them, back, to, athens, in, his, ship, but, in, thurii, he, escaped, with, his, crew, in, athens, he, was, convicted, in, absentia, and, condemned, to, death, his, property, was, confiscated, and, a, reward, of, one, talent, was, promised, to, whoever, succeeded, in, killing, any, who, had, fled, meanwhile, the, athenian, force, in, sicily, after, a, few, early, victories, moved, against, messina, where, the, generals, expected, their, secret, allies, within, the, city, to, betray, it, to, them, alcibiades, however, foreseeing, that, he, would, be, outlawed, gave, information, to, the, friends, of, the, syracusans, in, messina, who, succeeded, in, preventing, the, admission, of, the, athenians, with, the, death, of, lamachus, in, battle, some, time, later, command, of, the, sicilian, expedition, fell, into, the, hands, of, nicias, admired, by, thucydides, however, a, modern, scholar, has, judged, him, to, be, an, inadequate, military, leader, after, his, disappearance, at, thurii, alcibiades, quickly, contacted, the, spartans, promising, to, render, them, aid, and, service, greater, than, all, the, harm, he, had, previously, done, them, as, an, enemy, if, they, would, offer, him, sanctuary, the, spartans, granted, this, request, and, received, him, among, them, because, of, this, defection, the, athenians, condemned, him, to, death, in, absentia, and, confiscated, his, property, in, the, debate, at, sparta, over, whether, to, send, a, force, to, relieve, syracuse, alcibiades, spoke, and, instilled, fear, of, athenian, ambition, into, the, spartan, ephors, by, informing, them, that, the, athenians, hoped, to, conquer, sicily, italy, and, even, carthage, yale, historian, donald, kagan, believes, that, alcibiades, knowingly, exaggerated, the, plans, of, the, athenians, to, convince, the, spartans, of, the, benefit, they, stood, to, gain, from, his, help, kagan, asserts, that, alcibiades, had, not, yet, acquired, his, legendary, reputation, and, the, spartans, saw, him, as, a, defeated, and, hunted, man, whose, policies, produced, strategic, failures, and, brought, no, decisive, result, if, accurate, this, assessment, underscores, one, of, alcibiades, s, greatest, talents, his, highly, persuasive, oratory, after, making, the, threat, seem, imminent, alcibiades, advised, the, spartans, to, send, troops, and, most, importantly, a, spartan, commander, to, discipline, and, aid, the, syracusans, alcibiades, served, as, a, military, adviser, to, sparta, and, helped, the, spartans, secure, several, crucial, successes, he, advised, them, to, build, a, permanent, fort, at, decelea, just, over, ten, miles, 16, km, from, athens, and, within, sight, of, the, city, by, doing, this, the, spartans, cut, the, athenians, off, entirely, from, their, homes, and, crops, and, the, silver, mines, of, sunium, this, was, part, of, alcibiades, s, plan, to, renew, the, war, with, athens, in, attica, the, move, was, devastating, to, athens, and, forced, the, citizens, to, live, within, the, long, walls, of, the, city, year, round, making, them, entirely, dependent, on, their, seaborne, trade, for, food, seeing, athens, thus, beleaguered, on, a, second, front, members, of, the, delian, league, began, to, contemplate, revolt, in, the, wake, of, athens, s, disastrous, defeat, in, sicily, alcibiades, sailed, to, ionia, with, a, spartan, fleet, and, succeeded, in, persuading, several, critical, cities, to, revolt, in, spite, of, these, valuable, contributions, to, the, spartan, cause, around, this, time, alcibiades, fell, out, of, favor, with, the, government, of, king, agis, ii, leotychides, the, son, born, by, agis, s, wife, timaea, queen, of, sparta, or, queen, timonassa, shortly, after, this, was, believed, by, many, to, be, alcibiades, s, son, an, alternate, account, asserts, that, alcibiades, took, advantage, of, king, agis, absence, with, the, spartan, army, in, attica, and, seduced, his, wife, 207, alcibiades, s, influence, was, further, reduced, after, the, retirement, of, endius, the, ephor, who, was, on, good, terms, with, him, it, is, alleged, that, astyochus, a, spartan, admiral, was, sent, orders, to, kill, him, but, alcibiades, received, warning, of, this, order, and, defected, to, the, persian, satrap, tissaphernes, who, had, been, supporting, the, peloponnesian, forces, financially, in, 412, bc, on, his, arrival, in, the, local, persian, court, alcibiades, won, the, trust, of, the, powerful, satrap, and, made, several, policy, suggestions, which, were, well, received, according, to, thucydides, alcibiades, immediately, began, to, do, all, he, could, with, tissaphernes, to, injure, the, peloponnesian, cause, at, his, urging, the, satrap, reduced, the, payments, he, was, making, to, the, peloponnesian, fleet, and, began, delivering, them, irregularly, alcibiades, next, advised, tissaphernes, to, bribe, the, generals, of, the, cities, to, gain, valuable, intelligence, on, their, activities, lastly, and, most, importantly, he, told, the, satrap, to, be, in, no, hurry, to, bring, the, persian, fleet, into, the, conflict, as, the, longer, the, war, dragged, out, the, more, exhausted, the, combatants, would, become, this, would, allow, the, persians, to, more, easily, conquer, the, region, in, the, aftermath, of, the, fighting, alcibiades, tried, to, convince, the, satrap, that, it, was, in, persia, s, interest, to, wear, both, athens, and, sparta, out, at, first, and, after, docking, the, athenian, power, as, much, as, he, could, forthwith, to, rid, the, country, of, the, peloponnesians, although, alcibiades, s, advice, benefited, the, persians, it, was, merely, a, means, to, an, end, thucydides, tells, us, that, his, real, motive, was, to, use, his, alleged, influence, with, the, persians, to, effect, his, restoration, to, athens, alcibiades, was, one, of, several, greek, aristocrats, who, took, refuge, in, the, achaemenid, empire, following, reversals, at, home, other, famous, ones, being, themistocles, demaratos, or, gongylos, according, to, thucydides, thuc, 8, 47, alcibiades, also, advised, the, achaemenid, king, darius, ii, and, therefore, he, may, have, traveled, to, susa, or, babylonia, to, encounter, him, alcibiades, seemed, to, assume, that, the, radical, democracy, would, never, agree, to, his, recall, to, athens, he, exchanged, messages, with, the, athenian, leaders, at, samos, and, suggested, that, if, they, could, install, an, oligarchy, friendly, to, him, he, would, return, to, athens, and, bring, with, him, persian, money, and, possibly, the, persian, fleet, of, 147, triremes, alcibiades, set, about, winning, over, the, most, influential, military, officers, and, achieved, his, goal, by, offering, them, a, threefold, plan, the, athenian, constitution, was, to, be, changed, the, recall, of, alcibiades, was, to, be, voted, and, alcibiades, was, to, win, over, tissaphernes, and, the, king, of, persia, to, the, athenian, side, most, of, the, officers, in, the, athenian, fleet, accepted, the, plan, and, welcomed, the, prospect, of, a, narrower, constitution, which, would, allow, them, a, greater, part, in, determining, policy, according, to, thucydides, only, one, of, the, athenian, generals, at, samos, phrynichus, opposed, the, plan, and, argued, that, alcibiades, cared, no, more, for, the, proposed, oligarchy, than, for, the, traditional, democracy, the, involvement, in, the, plot, of, another, general, thrasybulus, remains, unclear, these, officers, of, the, athenian, fleet, formed, a, group, of, conspirators, but, were, met, with, opposition, from, the, majority, of, the, soldiers, and, sailors, these, were, eventually, calmed, down, by, the, advantageous, prospect, of, the, pay, from, the, king, the, members, of, the, group, assembled, and, prepared, to, send, pisander, one, of, their, number, on, an, embassy, to, athens, to, treat, for, the, restoration, of, alcibiades, and, the, abolition, of, democracy, in, the, city, and, thus, to, make, tissaphernes, the, friend, of, the, athenians, phrynichus, fearing, that, alcibiades, if, restored, would, avenge, himself, upon, him, for, his, opposition, sent, a, secret, letter, to, the, spartan, admiral, astyochus, to, tell, him, that, alcibiades, was, ruining, their, cause, by, making, tissaphernes, the, friend, of, the, athenians, and, containing, an, express, revelation, of, the, rest, of, the, intrigue, astyochus, went, up, to, alcibiades, and, tissaphernes, at, magnesia, and, communicated, to, them, phrynichus, s, letter, alcibiades, responded, in, kind, sending, to, the, authorities, at, samos, a, letter, against, phrynichus, stating, what, he, had, done, and, requiring, that, he, should, be, put, to, death, phrynichus, in, desperation, wrote, again, to, astyochus, offering, him, a, chance, to, destroy, the, athenian, fleet, at, samos, this, also, astyochus, revealed, to, alcibiades, who, informed, the, officers, at, samos, that, they, had, been, betrayed, by, phrynichus, alcibiades, however, gained, no, credit, because, phrynichus, had, anticipated, alcibiades, s, letter, and, before, the, accusations, could, arrive, told, the, army, that, he, had, received, information, of, an, enemy, plan, to, attack, the, camp, and, that, they, should, fortify, samos, as, quickly, as, possible, despite, these, events, pisander, and, the, other, envoys, of, the, conspirators, arrived, at, athens, and, made, a, speech, before, the, people, pisander, won, the, argument, putting, alcibiades, and, his, promises, at, the, center, the, ecclesia, deposed, phrynichus, and, elected, pisander, and, ten, other, envoys, to, negotiate, with, tissaphernes, and, alcibiades, at, this, point, alcibiades, s, scheme, encountered, a, great, obstacle, tissaphernes, would, not, make, an, agreement, on, any, terms, wanting, to, follow, his, policy, of, neutrality, as, kagan, points, out, tissaphernes, was, a, prudent, leader, and, had, recognized, the, advantages, of, wearing, each, side, out, without, direct, persian, involvement, alcibiades, realized, this, and, by, presenting, the, athenians, with, stiffer, and, stiffer, demands, on, tissaphernes, s, behalf, attempted, to, convince, them, that, he, had, persuaded, tissaphernes, to, support, them, but, that, they, had, not, conceded, enough, to, him, although, the, envoys, were, angered, at, the, audacity, of, the, persian, demands, they, nevertheless, departed, with, the, impression, that, alcibiades, could, have, brought, about, an, agreement, among, the, powers, if, he, had, chosen, to, do, so, this, fiasco, at, the, court, of, tissaphernes, however, put, an, end, to, the, negotiations, between, the, conspirators, and, alcibiades, the, group, was, convinced, that, alcibiades, could, not, deliver, his, side, of, the, bargain, without, demanding, exorbitantly, high, concessions, of, them, and, they, accordingly, abandoned, their, plans, to, restore, him, to, athens, in, spite, of, the, failure, of, the, negotiations, the, conspirators, succeeded, in, overthrowing, the, democracy, and, imposing, the, oligarchic, government, of, the, four, hundred, among, the, leaders, of, which, were, phrynichus, and, pisander, at, samos, however, a, similar, coup, instigated, by, the, conspirators, did, not, go, forward, so, smoothly, samian, democrats, learned, of, the, conspiracy, and, notified, four, prominent, athenians, the, generals, leon, and, diomedon, the, trierarch, thrasybulus, and, thrasyllus, at, that, time, a, hoplite, in, the, ranks, with, the, support, of, these, men, and, the, athenian, soldiers, in, general, the, samian, democrats, were, able, to, defeat, the, 300, samian, oligarchs, who, attempted, to, seize, power, there, further, the, athenian, troops, at, samos, formed, themselves, into, a, political, assembly, deposed, their, generals, and, elected, new, ones, including, thrasybulus, and, thrasyllus, the, army, stating, that, they, had, not, revolted, from, the, city, but, that, the, city, had, revolted, from, them, resolved, to, stand, by, the, democracy, while, continuing, to, prosecute, the, war, against, sparta, after, a, time, thrasybulus, persuaded, the, assembled, troops, to, vote, alcibiades, s, recall, a, policy, that, he, had, supported, since, before, the, coup, then, he, sailed, to, retrieve, alcibiades, and, returned, with, him, to, samos, the, aim, of, this, policy, was, to, win, away, persian, support, from, the, spartans, as, it, was, still, believed, that, alcibiades, had, great, influence, with, tissaphernes, plutarch, claims, that, the, army, sent, for, alcibiades, so, as, to, use, his, help, in, putting, down, the, tyrants, in, athens, kagan, argues, that, this, reinstatement, was, a, disappointment, to, alcibiades, who, had, hoped, for, a, glorious, return, to, athens, itself, but, found, himself, only, restored, to, the, rebellious, fleet, where, the, immunity, from, prosecution, he, had, been, granted, protected, him, for, the, time, being, but, not, from, a, reckoning, in, the, future, furthermore, the, recall, which, alcibiades, had, hoped, to, bring, about, through, his, own, prestige, and, perceived, influence, was, achieved, through, the, patronage, of, thrasybulus, in, his, first, speech, to, the, assembled, troops, alcibiades, complained, bitterly, about, the, circumstances, of, his, exile, but, most, of, the, speech, was, boasting, of, his, influence, with, tissaphernes, the, primary, motives, of, his, speech, were, to, make, the, oligarchs, at, athens, fear, him, and, to, increase, his, credit, with, the, army, at, samos, upon, hearing, his, speech, the, troops, immediately, elected, him, general, alongside, thrasybulus, and, the, others, he, roused, them, so, much, that, they, proposed, to, sail, at, once, for, piraeus, and, attack, the, oligarchs, in, athens, it, was, primarily, alcibiades, along, with, thrasybulus, who, calmed, the, people, and, showed, them, the, folly, of, this, proposal, which, would, have, sparked, civil, war, and, would, have, led, to, the, immediate, defeat, of, athens, shortly, after, alcibiades, s, reinstatement, as, an, athenian, general, the, government, of, the, four, hundred, was, overthrown, and, replaced, by, a, broader, oligarchy, which, would, eventually, give, way, to, democracy, presently, alcibiades, sailed, to, tissaphernes, with, a, detachment, of, ships, according, to, plutarch, the, supposed, purpose, of, this, mission, was, to, stop, the, persian, fleet, from, coming, to, the, aid, of, the, peloponnesians, thucydides, is, in, agreement, with, plutarch, that, the, persian, fleet, was, at, aspendus, and, that, alcibiades, told, the, troops, he, would, bring, the, fleet, to, their, side, or, prevent, it, from, coming, at, all, but, thucydides, further, speculates, that, the, real, reason, was, to, flaunt, his, new, position, to, tissaphernes, and, try, to, gain, some, real, influence, over, him, according, to, the, historian, alcibiades, had, long, known, that, tissaphernes, never, meant, to, bring, the, fleet, at, all, alcibiades, was, recalled, by, the, intermediate, regime, of, the, five, thousand, the, government, which, succeeded, the, four, hundred, in, 411, but, it, is, most, likely, that, he, waited, until, 407, bc, to, actually, return, to, the, city, plutarch, tells, us, that, although, his, recall, had, already, been, passed, on, motion, of, critias, a, political, ally, of, his, alcibiades, was, resolved, to, come, back, with, glory, while, this, was, certainly, his, goal, it, was, again, a, means, to, an, end, that, end, being, to, avoid, prosecution, upon, his, return, to, athens, the, next, significant, part, he, would, play, in, the, war, would, occur, at, the, battle, of, abydos, alcibiades, had, remained, behind, at, samos, with, a, small, force, while, thrasybulus, and, thrasyllus, led, the, greater, part, of, the, fleet, to, the, hellespont, during, this, period, alcibiades, succeeded, in, raising, money, from, caria, and, the, neighboring, area, with, which, he, was, able, to, pay, the, rowers, and, gain, their, favor, after, the, athenian, victory, at, cynossema, both, fleets, summoned, all, their, ships, from, around, the, aegean, to, join, them, for, what, might, be, a, decisive, next, engagement, while, alcibiades, was, still, en, route, the, athenians, fought, off, the, arrival, of, the, rhodian, admiral, dorieus, who, appeared, with, 14, ships, and, was, forced, into, rhoeteium, the, spartans, sailed, to, assist, him, and, the, two, fleets, clashed, at, abydos, where, the, peloponnesians, had, set, up, their, main, naval, base, the, battle, was, evenly, matched, and, raged, for, a, long, time, but, the, balance, tipped, towards, the, athenians, when, alcibiades, sailed, into, the, hellespont, with, eighteen, triremes, the, persian, satrap, pharnabazus, who, had, replaced, tissaphernes, as, the, sponsor, of, the, peloponnesian, fleet, moved, his, land, army, to, the, shore, to, defend, the, ships, and, sailors, who, had, beached, their, ships, only, the, support, of, the, persian, land, army, and, the, coming, of, night, saved, the, peloponnesian, fleet, from, complete, destruction, shortly, after, the, battle, tissaphernes, had, arrived, in, the, hellespont, and, alcibiades, left, the, fleet, at, sestos, to, meet, him, bringing, gifts, and, hoping, once, again, to, try, to, win, over, the, persian, governor, evidently, alcibiades, had, gravely, misjudged, his, standing, with, the, satrap, and, he, was, arrested, on, arrival, within, a, month, he, would, escape, with, another, athenian, mantitheos, and, resume, command, it, was, now, obvious, however, that, he, had, no, influence, with, the, persians, from, now, on, his, authority, would, depend, on, what, he, actually, could, accomplish, rather, than, on, what, he, promised, to, do, after, an, interlude, of, several, months, in, which, the, peloponnesians, constructed, new, ships, and, the, athenians, besieged, cities, and, raised, money, throughout, the, aegean, the, next, major, sea, battle, took, place, the, spring, of, 410, bc, at, cyzicus, alcibiades, had, been, forced, to, flee, from, sestos, to, cardia, to, protect, his, small, fleet, from, the, rebuilt, peloponnesian, navy, but, as, soon, as, the, athenian, fleet, was, reunited, there, its, commanders, led, it, to, cyzicus, where, the, athenians, had, intelligence, indicating, that, pharnabazus, and, mindarus, the, peloponnesian, fleet, commander, were, together, plotting, their, next, move, concealed, by, storm, and, darkness, the, combined, athenian, force, reached, the, vicinity, without, being, spotted, by, the, peloponnesians, here, the, athenians, devised, a, plot, to, draw, the, enemy, into, battle, according, to, diodorus, siculus, alcibiades, advanced, with, a, small, squadron, in, order, to, draw, the, spartans, out, to, battle, and, after, he, successfully, deceived, mindarus, with, this, ploy, the, squadrons, of, thrasybulus, and, theramenes, came, to, join, him, cutting, off, the, spartans, retreat, the, spartan, fleet, suffered, losses, in, the, flight, and, reached, the, shore, with, the, athenians, in, close, pursuit, alcibiades, troops, leading, the, athenian, pursuit, landed, and, attempted, to, pull, the, spartan, ships, back, out, to, sea, the, peloponnesians, fought, to, prevent, their, ships, from, being, towed, away, and, pharnabazus, s, troops, came, up, to, support, them, thrasybulus, landed, his, own, force, to, temporarily, relieve, pressure, on, alcibiades, and, meanwhile, ordered, theramenes, to, join, up, with, athenian, land, forces, nearby, and, bring, them, to, reinforce, the, sailors, and, marines, on, the, beach, the, spartans, and, persians, overwhelmed, by, the, arrival, of, multiple, forces, from, several, directions, were, defeated, and, driven, off, and, the, athenians, captured, all, the, spartan, ships, which, were, not, destroyed, a, letter, dispatched, to, sparta, by, hippocrates, vice, admiral, under, mindarus, was, intercepted, and, taken, to, athens, it, ran, as, follows, the, ships, are, lost, mindarus, is, dead, the, men, are, starving, we, know, not, what, to, do, a, short, time, later, sparta, petitioned, for, peace, but, their, appeals, were, ultimately, rejected, by, the, athenians, after, their, victory, alcibiades, and, thrasybulus, began, the, siege, of, chalcedon, in, 409, bc, with, about, 190, ships, although, unable, to, attain, a, decisive, victory, or, induce, the, city, to, surrender, alcibiades, was, able, to, win, a, small, tactical, land, battle, outside, of, the, city, gates, and, theramenes, concluded, an, agreement, with, the, chalcedonians, afterwards, they, concluded, a, temporary, alliance, with, pharnabazus, which, secured, some, much, needed, immediate, cash, for, the, army, but, despite, this, alcibiades, was, still, forced, to, depart, in, search, for, more, booty, to, pay, the, soldiers, and, oarsmen, of, the, fleet, in, pursuit, of, these, funds, he, traveled, to, the, thracian, chersonese, and, attacked, selymbria, he, plotted, with, a, pro, athenian, party, within, the, city, and, offered, the, selymbrians, reasonable, terms, imposing, strict, discipline, on, his, men, to, see, that, they, were, observed, he, did, the, selymbrians, s, city, no, injury, whatsoever, but, merely, took, a, sum, of, money, from, it, set, a, garrison, there, and, left, epigraphical, evidence, indicates, the, selymbrians, surrendered, hostages, until, the, treaty, was, ratified, in, athens, his, performance, is, judged, as, skillful, by, historians, since, it, saved, time, resources, and, lives, and, still, fully, achieved, his, goal, from, here, alcibiades, joined, in, the, siege, of, byzantium, along, with, theramenes, and, thrasyllus, a, portion, of, the, citizens, of, the, city, demoralized, and, hungry, decided, to, surrender, the, city, to, alcibiades, for, similar, terms, as, the, selymbrians, had, received, on, the, designated, night, the, defenders, left, their, posts, and, the, athenians, attacked, the, peloponnesian, garrison, in, the, city, and, their, boats, in, the, harbor, the, portion, of, the, citizenry, that, remained, loyal, to, the, peloponnesians, fought, so, savagely, that, alcibiades, issued, a, statement, in, the, midst, of, the, fighting, which, guaranteed, their, safety, and, this, persuaded, the, remaining, citizens, to, turn, against, the, peloponnesian, garrison, which, was, nearly, totally, destroyed, it, was, in, the, aftermath, of, these, successes, that, alcibiades, resolved, to, finally, return, to, athens, in, the, spring, of, 407, bc, even, in, the, wake, of, his, recent, victories, alcibiades, was, exceedingly, careful, in, his, return, mindful, of, the, changes, in, government, the, charges, still, technically, hanging, over, him, and, the, great, injury, he, had, done, to, athens, thus, alcibiades, rather, than, going, straight, home, first, went, to, samos, to, pick, up, 20, ships, and, proceeded, with, them, to, the, ceramic, gulf, where, he, collected, 100, talents, he, finally, sailed, to, gytheion, to, make, inquiries, partly, about, the, reported, preparations, of, the, spartans, there, and, partly, about, the, feelings, in, athens, regarding, his, return, his, inquiries, assured, him, that, the, city, was, kindly, disposed, towards, him, and, that, his, closest, friends, urged, him, to, return, therefore, he, finally, sailed, into, piraeus, where, the, crowd, had, gathered, desiring, to, see, the, famous, alcibiades, he, entered, the, harbor, full, of, fear, until, he, saw, his, cousin, and, others, of, his, friends, and, acquaintances, who, invited, him, to, land, upon, arriving, on, shore, he, was, greeted, with, a, hero, s, welcome, nevertheless, some, saw, an, evil, omen, in, the, fact, that, he, had, returned, to, athens, on, the, very, day, when, the, ceremony, of, the, plynteria, the, feast, where, the, old, statue, of, athena, would, get, cleansed, was, being, celebrated, this, was, regarded, as, the, unluckiest, day, of, the, year, to, undertake, anything, of, importance, his, enemies, took, note, of, this, and, kept, it, in, mind, for, a, future, occasion, all, the, criminal, proceedings, against, him, were, canceled, and, the, charges, of, blasphemy, were, officially, withdrawn, alcibiades, was, able, to, assert, his, piety, and, to, raise, athenian, morale, by, leading, the, solemn, procession, to, eleusis, for, the, celebration, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, by, land, for, the, first, time, since, the, spartans, had, occupied, decelea, the, procession, had, been, replaced, by, a, sea, voyage, but, this, year, alcibiades, used, a, detachment, of, soldiers, to, escort, the, traditional, procession, his, property, was, restored, and, the, ecclesia, elected, him, supreme, commander, of, land, and, sea, strategos, autokrator, in, 406, bc, alcibiades, set, out, from, athens, with, 1, 500, hoplites, and, a, hundred, ships, he, failed, to, take, andros, and, then, he, went, on, to, samos, later, he, moved, to, notium, closer, to, the, enemy, at, ephesus, meanwhile, tissaphernes, had, been, replaced, by, cyrus, the, younger, son, of, darius, ii, of, persia, who, decided, to, financially, support, the, peloponnesians, this, new, revenue, started, to, attract, athenian, deserters, to, the, spartan, navy, additionally, the, spartans, had, replaced, mindarus, with, lysander, a, very, capable, admiral, these, factors, caused, the, rapid, growth, of, the, peloponnesian, fleet, at, the, expense, of, the, athenian, in, search, of, funds, and, needing, to, force, another, decisive, battle, alcibiades, left, notium, and, sailed, to, help, thrasybulus, in, the, siege, of, phocaea, alcibiades, was, aware, the, spartan, fleet, was, nearby, so, he, left, nearly, eighty, ships, to, watch, them, under, the, command, of, his, personal, helmsman, antiochus, who, was, given, express, orders, not, to, attack, antiochus, disobeyed, this, single, order, and, endeavored, to, draw, lysander, into, a, fight, by, imitating, the, tactics, used, at, cyzicus, the, situation, at, notium, however, was, radically, different, from, that, at, cyzicus, the, athenians, possessed, no, element, of, surprise, and, lysander, had, been, well, informed, about, their, fleet, by, deserters, antiochus, s, ship, was, sunk, and, he, was, killed, by, a, sudden, spartan, attack, the, remaining, ships, of, the, decoy, force, were, then, chased, headlong, back, toward, notium, where, the, main, athenian, force, was, caught, unprepared, by, the, sudden, arrival, of, the, whole, spartan, fleet, in, the, ensuing, fighting, lysander, gained, an, entire, victory, alcibiades, soon, returned, and, desperately, tried, to, undo, the, defeat, at, notium, by, scoring, another, victory, but, lysander, could, not, be, compelled, to, attack, the, fleet, again, responsibility, for, the, defeat, ultimately, fell, on, alcibiades, and, his, enemies, used, the, opportunity, to, attack, him, and, have, him, removed, from, command, although, some, modern, scholars, believe, that, alcibiades, was, unfairly, blamed, for, antiochus, s, mistake, diodorus, reports, that, in, addition, to, his, mistake, at, notium, alcibiades, was, discharged, on, account, of, false, accusations, brought, against, him, by, his, enemies, according, to, historian, antony, andrewes, the, extravagant, hopes, that, his, successes, of, the, previous, summer, had, created, were, a, decisive, element, in, his, downfall, consequently, alcibiades, condemned, himself, to, exile, never, again, returning, to, athens, he, sailed, north, to, the, castles, in, the, thracian, chersonese, which, he, had, secured, during, his, time, in, the, hellespont, the, implications, of, the, defeat, were, severe, for, athens, although, the, defeat, had, been, minor, it, occasioned, the, removal, of, not, only, alcibiades, but, also, his, allies, such, as, thrasybulus, theramenes, and, critias, these, were, likely, the, most, capable, commanders, athens, had, at, the, time, and, their, removal, would, help, lead, to, the, athenian, surrender, only, two, years, later, after, their, complete, defeat, at, aegospotami, with, one, exception, alcibiades, s, role, in, the, war, ended, with, his, command, prior, to, the, battle, of, aegospotami, in, the, last, attested, fact, of, his, career, alcibiades, recognized, that, the, athenians, were, anchored, in, a, tactically, disadvantageous, spot, and, advised, them, to, move, to, sestus, where, they, could, benefit, from, a, harbor, and, a, city, diodorus, however, does, not, mention, this, advice, arguing, instead, that, alcibiades, offered, the, generals, thracian, aid, in, exchange, for, a, share, in, the, command, in, any, case, the, generals, of, the, athenians, considering, that, in, case, of, defeat, the, blame, would, attach, to, them, and, that, in, case, of, success, all, men, would, attribute, it, to, alcibiades, asked, him, to, leave, and, not, come, near, the, camp, ever, again, days, later, the, fleet, would, be, annihilated, by, lysander, after, the, battle, of, aegospotami, alcibiades, crossed, the, hellespont, and, took, refuge, in, hellespontine, phrygia, with, the, object, of, securing, the, aid, of, the, achaemenid, king, artaxerxes, against, sparta, alcibiades, was, one, of, several, greek, aristocrats, who, took, refuge, in, the, achaemenid, empire, following, reversals, at, home, other, famous, ones, being, themistocles, hippias, demaratos, and, gongylos, for, the, most, part, they, were, generously, welcomed, by, the, achaemenid, kings, and, received, land, grants, to, support, them, and, ruled, in, various, cities, of, asia, minor, much, about, the, circumstances, of, alcibiades, s, death, is, uncertain, as, there, are, conflicting, accounts, according, to, the, oldest, of, these, the, spartans, and, specifically, lysander, were, responsible, though, many, of, his, details, cannot, be, independently, corroborated, plutarch, s, version, is, that, lysander, sent, an, envoy, to, pharnabazus, who, then, dispatched, his, brother, to, phrygia, where, alcibiades, was, living, with, his, mistress, timandra, in, 404, bc, as, he, was, about, to, set, out, for, the, persian, court, his, residence, was, surrounded, and, set, on, fire, seeing, no, chance, of, escape, he, rushed, out, on, his, assassins, dagger, in, hand, and, was, killed, by, a, shower, of, arrows, according, to, aristotle, the, site, of, alcibiades, s, death, was, elaphus, a, mountain, in, phrygia, in, ancient, greece, alcibiades, was, a, polarizing, figure, according, to, thucydides, alcibiades, being, exceedingly, ambitious, proposed, the, expedition, in, sicily, in, order, to, gain, in, wealth, and, reputation, by, means, of, his, successes, alcibiades, is, not, held, responsible, by, thucydides, for, the, destruction, of, athens, since, his, habits, gave, offence, to, every, one, and, caused, the, athenians, to, commit, affairs, to, other, hands, and, thus, before, long, to, ruin, the, city, plutarch, regards, him, as, the, least, scrupulous, and, most, entirely, careless, of, human, beings, on, the, other, hand, diodorus, argues, that, he, was, in, spirit, brilliant, and, intent, upon, great, enterprises, sharon, press, of, brown, university, points, out, that, xenophon, emphasizes, alcibiades, s, service, to, the, state, rather, than, the, harm, he, was, charged, with, causing, it, demosthenes, defends, alcibiades, s, achievements, saying, that, he, had, taken, arms, in, the, cause, of, democracy, displaying, his, patriotism, not, by, gifts, of, money, or, by, speeches, but, by, personal, service, for, demosthenes, and, other, orators, alcibiades, epitomized, the, figure, of, the, great, man, during, the, glorious, days, of, the, athenian, democracy, and, became, a, rhetorical, symbol, one, of, isocrates, speeches, delivered, by, alcibiades, the, younger, argues, that, the, statesman, deserved, the, athenians, gratitude, for, the, service, he, had, given, them, lysias, on, the, other, hand, argued, in, one, of, his, orations, that, the, athenians, should, regard, alcibiades, as, an, enemy, because, of, the, general, tenor, of, his, life, as, he, repays, with, injury, the, open, assistance, of, any, of, his, friends, in, the, constitution, of, the, athenians, aristotle, does, not, include, alcibiades, in, the, list, of, the, best, athenian, politicians, but, in, posterior, analytics, he, argues, that, traits, of, a, proud, man, like, alcibiades, are, equanimity, amid, the, vicissitudes, of, life, and, impatience, of, dishonor, alcibiades, excited, in, his, contemporaries, a, fear, for, the, safety, of, the, political, order, therefore, andocides, said, of, him, that, instead, of, holding, that, he, ought, himself, to, conform, with, the, laws, of, the, state, he, expects, you, to, conform, with, his, own, way, of, life, central, to, the, depiction, of, the, athenian, statesman, is, cornelius, nepos, famous, phrase, that, alcibiades, surpassed, all, the, athenians, in, grandeur, and, magnificence, of, living, even, today, alcibiades, divides, scholars, for, malcolm, f, mcgregor, former, head, of, the, department, of, classics, in, the, university, of, british, columbia, alcibiades, was, rather, a, shrewd, gambler, than, a, mere, opportunist, evangelos, p, fotiadis, a, prominent, greek, philologist, asserts, that, alcibiades, was, a, first, class, diplomat, and, had, huge, skills, nevertheless, his, spiritual, powers, were, not, counterbalanced, with, his, magnificent, mind, and, he, had, the, hard, luck, to, lead, a, people, susceptible, to, demagoguery, k, paparrigopoulos, a, major, modern, greek, historian, underlines, his, spiritual, virtues, and, compares, him, with, themistocles, but, he, then, asserts, that, all, these, gifts, created, a, traitor, an, audacious, and, impious, man, walter, ellis, believes, that, his, actions, were, outrageous, but, they, were, performed, with, panache, for, his, part, david, gribble, argues, that, alcibiades, s, actions, against, his, city, were, misunderstood, and, believes, that, the, tension, which, led, to, alcibiades, s, split, with, the, city, was, between, purely, personal, and, civic, values, russell, meiggs, a, british, ancient, historian, asserts, that, the, athenian, statesman, was, absolutely, unscrupulous, despite, his, great, charm, and, brilliant, abilities, according, to, meiggs, his, actions, were, dictated, by, selfish, motives, and, his, feud, with, cleon, and, his, successors, undermined, athens, the, same, scholar, underscores, the, fact, that, his, example, of, restless, and, undisciplined, ambition, strengthened, the, charge, brought, against, socrates, even, more, critically, athanasios, g, platias, and, constantinos, koliopoulos, professors, of, strategic, studies, and, international, politics, state, that, alcibiades, s, own, arguments, should, be, sufficient, to, do, away, with, the, notion, that, alcibiades, was, a, great, statesman, as, some, people, still, believe, writing, from, a, different, perspective, psychologist, anna, c, salter, cites, alcibiades, as, exhibiting, all, the, classic, features, of, psychopathy, a, similar, assessment, is, made, by, hervey, cleckley, at, the, end, of, chapter, 5, in, his, the, mask, of, sanity, despite, his, critical, comments, thucydides, admits, in, a, short, digression, that, publicly, his, conduct, of, the, war, was, as, good, as, could, be, desired, diodorus, and, demosthenes, regard, him, as, a, great, general, according, to, fotiadis, alcibiades, was, an, invincible, general, and, wherever, he, went, victory, followed, him, had, he, led, the, army, in, sicily, the, athenians, would, have, avoided, disaster, and, had, his, countrymen, followed, his, advice, at, aegospotami, lysander, would, have, lost, and, athens, would, have, ruled, greece, on, the, other, hand, paparrigopoulos, believes, that, the, sicilian, expedition, prompted, by, alcibiades, was, a, strategic, mistake, in, agreement, with, paparrigopoulos, platias, and, koliopoulos, underscore, the, fact, that, the, sicilian, expedition, was, a, strategic, blunder, of, the, first, magnitude, resulting, from, a, frivolous, attitude, and, an, unbelievable, underestimation, of, the, enemy, for, his, part, angelos, vlachos, a, greek, academician, underlines, the, constant, interest, of, athens, for, sicily, from, the, beginning, of, the, war, according, to, vlachos, the, expedition, had, nothing, of, the, extravagant, or, adventurous, and, constituted, a, rational, strategic, decision, based, on, traditional, athenian, aspirations, vlachos, asserts, that, alcibiades, had, already, conceived, a, broader, plan, the, conquest, of, the, whole, west, he, intended, to, conquer, carthage, and, libya, then, to, attack, italy, and, after, winning, these, to, seize, italy, and, peloponnesus, the, initial, decision, of, the, ecclesia, provided, however, for, a, reasonable, military, force, which, later, became, unreasonably, large, and, costly, because, of, nicias, s, demands, kagan, criticizes, alcibiades, for, failing, to, recognize, that, the, large, size, of, the, athenian, expedition, undermined, the, diplomatic, scheme, on, which, his, strategy, rested, kagan, believes, that, while, alcibiades, was, a, commander, of, considerable, ability, he, was, no, military, genius, and, his, confidence, and, ambitions, went, far, beyond, his, skills, he, thus, was, capable, of, important, errors, and, serious, miscalculations, kagan, argues, that, at, notium, alcibiades, committed, a, serious, error, in, leaving, the, fleet, in, the, hands, of, an, inexperienced, officer, and, that, most, of, the, credit, for, the, brilliant, victory, at, cyzicus, must, be, assigned, to, thrasybulus, in, this, judgement, kagan, agrees, with, cornelius, nepos, who, said, that, the, athenians, extravagant, opinion, of, alcibiades, s, abilities, and, valor, was, his, chief, misfortune, press, argues, that, though, alcibiades, can, be, considered, a, good, general, on, the, basis, of, his, performance, in, the, hellespont, he, would, not, be, considered, so, on, the, basis, of, his, performance, in, sicily, but, the, strengths, of, alcibiades, s, performance, as, a, general, outweigh, his, faults, plutarch, asserts, that, alcibiades, was, a, most, able, speaker, in, addition, to, his, other, gifts, while, theophrastus, argues, that, alcibiades, was, the, most, capable, of, discovering, and, understanding, what, was, required, in, a, given, case, nevertheless, he, would, often, stumble, in, the, midst, of, his, speech, but, then, he, would, resume, and, proceed, with, all, the, caution, in, the, world, even, the, lisp, he, had, which, was, noticed, by, aristophanes, made, his, talk, persuasive, and, full, of, charm, eupolis, says, that, he, was, prince, of, talkers, but, in, speaking, most, incapable, which, is, to, say, more, eloquent, in, his, private, discourses, than, when, orating, before, the, ecclesia, for, his, part, demosthenes, underscores, the, fact, that, alcibiades, was, regarded, as, the, ablest, speaker, of, the, day, paparrigopoulos, does, not, accept, demosthenes, s, opinion, but, acknowledges, that, the, athenian, statesman, could, sufficiently, support, his, case, kagan, acknowledges, his, rhetorical, power, whilst, thomas, habinek, professor, of, classics, at, the, university, of, southern, california, believes, that, the, orator, alcibiades, seemed, to, be, whatever, his, audience, needed, on, any, given, occasion, according, to, habinek, in, the, field, of, oratory, the, people, responded, to, alcibiades, s, affection, with, affection, of, their, own, therefore, the, orator, was, the, institution, of, the, city, talking, to, and, loving, itself, according, to, aristophanes, athens, yearns, for, him, and, hates, him, too, but, wants, him, back, alcibiades, has, not, been, spared, by, ancient, comedy, and, stories, attest, to, an, epic, confrontation, between, alcibiades, and, eupolis, resembling, that, between, aristophanes, and, cleon, he, also, appears, as, a, character, in, several, socratic, dialogues, symposium, protagoras, alcibiades, i, and, ii, where, he, is, depicted, as, a, lover, and, student, of, socrates, as, well, as, the, eponymous, dialogues, by, aeschines, socraticus, and, antisthenes, purportedly, based, on, his, own, personal, experience, antisthenes, described, alcibiades, s, extraordinary, physical, strength, courage, and, beauty, saying, if, achilles, did, not, look, like, this, he, was, not, really, handsome, in, his, trial, socrates, rebuts, the, attempt, to, hold, him, guilty, for, the, crimes, of, his, former, students, including, alcibiades, hence, he, declares, in, apology, i, have, never, been, anyone, s, teacher, alcibiades, has, been, depicted, regularly, in, art, both, in, medieval, and, renaissance, works, and, in, several, significant, works, of, modern, literature, as, well, he, is, a, major, character, in, shakespeare, and, thomas, middleton, s, tragicomic, play, timon, of, athens, speaking, no, less, than, 7, of, total, lines, and, appearing, in, five, scenes, at, the, beginning, middle, and, ending, of, the, play, he, has, been, the, main, character, in, historical, novels, of, authors, like, anna, bowman, dodd, gertrude, atherton, mary, renault, rosemary, sutcliff, daniel, chavarria, steven, pressfield, peter, green, and, ilja, leonard, pfeijffer, alcibiades, is, also, involved, in, the, plot, of, the, video, game, assassin, s, creed, odyssey, under, the, name, alkibiades, alcibiades, s, military, prowess, was, cited, by,
